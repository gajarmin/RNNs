I'm damned if I do and damned if I don't
Holla fuck the world with my chest full of smoke
I choke on my breakfast, the end of my necklace
Say Dopehouse Records, Screwston, Texas
The diamonds in my emblem is cut like a princess
You can keep the Lexus, cause I got two Benzes
I'm in your girlfriends' hot intestines
Cause I bought her two dresses and some contact lenses
Got a message in a bottle, hit the throttle in my carro
Click and clack my semi auto cause I'm trying to see tomorrow
Bought a condo for my top ho cause she working that taco
It's the top selling vato, twenty threes on the Tahoe
TV screens, margarita machines with street marines
Got love for the Crips, and Bloods, and Latin Kings
If it means anything this for all my G's
I'm in jail cause I forgot my fucking ABC's
Another DWI, drunk and fucking high
I'll be out before the motherfucking sun can touch the sky
They call me young Thurston Howell the Third
And that's my word
I'm a swang, I'm a swerve
I'm a park and scrape the curve

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Why when I'm not high does my life
Feel like it's missing something
I know that I must be high
So that I can function

I'm a use my three wishes, I'm very superstitious
No matter where I go I meet a bunch of horny bitches
Burn a few bridges, feed a few pigeons
Fuck em so good they wake up and wash dishes
The food was delicious, bacon, eggs, and biscuits
No French kisses and no hippopotamuses
I'm picky, if you strictly dickly, you can't get with me
As I represent Houston like the damn Whitney
I'm a get em when I get em I loved em and I fed em
Lived in peace, I ain't gonna let em when I see em I'm gonna wet em
Shut em down like D-Town and the homie Ackavelie
Peace to Happareli and my nigga John Freddy
My drink is thick as jelly, I love my shit muddy
Four of us in this bitch and we gonna do them boys ugly
Ready for the rumble, leave em lying in a puddle
Y'all don't really want no trouble with the lord of the jungle

[Hook]

I walks in the club, a grabbing on my dick
As the police officers patting down my click
They say my bandana breaks the dress code
Every fine fucking bitch I see is my ex ho
I'm hogging and I'm dogging creeping and I'm crawling
Believe me this my calling it's time to do you all in
Everybody jump jump, boys trip what what
Let my double barrel shotty go barump-pa-pump-pum
Slangin slab motor rocks up in no man's land
Burnin off in my "Smokey and the Bandit" Trans Am
The rope around my neck is just dangling and jangling
Sometime I smoke the rain, it get wetter than a penguin
Aunt Jemima sipper, hoes like Jack Tripper
Peace to Big Dipper, what the deal my nigga
Hook like "Johnny‚Äù Tapia , it's Dopehouse living prosperous
I tip my waitress and she can't stop saying 'Gracias'

[Hook][Verse 1: South Park Mexican]
Pull up, on the double, these boys want trouble
They call me Flintstone, and my homie's born/Barn' Rubble
Rebel
Devil
Chase em' through the ghetto
Break these motherfuckers off with just one dedo
Metal bracelets, facin'
Once, incarceration
Aim for the dome, gotta keep my concentration
Since elementary
It was destined for me
To see the penitentiary
Late Friday, or was it early Saturday
I hit him with the shotty that I bought from Academy
Duck for cover, you marked, motherfucker
Didn't momma say not to play with niggas from the gutter
I smell undercovers
I die with my brothers
And when I'm on the mic, I represent
All colors
Last summer
I escaped from an asylum
You know the three digits, bitch, you better dial 'em

Break 1: South Park Mexican
No matter where you at, do you represent your city
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy

Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy

Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy

[Verse 2: Baby Bash]
I suck the blood like mosquito
Facin' Judge Ito
Joint in my mouth, lookin' big as a burrito
Turnin' ten into twenty
Twenty into forty
Forty into eighty
Everything is gravy
Won't you play me in your deck-ah
Microphone check-ah
Quick to grab a chickenhead, hutch by the neck-ah
Double decker
Hoes on my Woody Woodpecker
Niggas call me cryin', say that I'm a homewrecker
Berreta
Underneath my
Raider sweater
Fuck a fine loca by the name of Jueta
Stackin' more cheddar, the Speedy Gonzales
Smoother than the head of Mister Telly Sevalas
Tu sabes, haciendo jales
Movin' yabes
Order two tacos with the beans and nopales
Don't blame us
Just because I'm famous
And got my middle
Finger up your baby mama anus
Biotch

Break 2: South Park Mexican
Do you raise Ben Davis, or do you sag Dickies

Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
Do you sleep with your wife or with a nine milli
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy

[Verse 3: South Park Mexican]
I got sacks for sale, in the land of hell
My enemies don't even get a chance to yell
In the black Seville
With my man Miguel
Little pigs wanna put my fuckin' ass in jail
Stack my mail
Where the bastards dwell
Puffin' on Jane cause that's my gal
Never brag or tell
But I blast 'em well
I shoot more shots than Sam Cassell/can sell
Well
Pick the chosen, and form an alliance
Move in silence and gather loyal clients
Corporate giants
With street science
Cookin' dope on a kitchen appliance
Don't try it
If you can't keep quiet
I put seventeen bullets in your diet
Layin' in a puddle cause you hoes wanna rumble
SPM like Tarzan
King of the jungle

Would you fuck a thick bitch, even though she wasn't pretty
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
If I was doin' bad, would you smoke a blunt with me

Do you hit anything or are you really picky
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy(Verse 1)
They wipe tears, while I wipe fingerprints off lead
They say shoot for the stars, I say shoot for the head
I beleave in good times having peace and fun
But im still in my room, tryna grease my gun
Can't let it get rusty, if it shoot I breaks
The only thing I want jammin is my screwed out tape
And tomorrow is a big day, gotta get my rest
Forty five "G's" out of town, link by a tres
I'm all alone, my girl said that she couldn't make it
Cuz she caught a damn cold, and her whole body is achin
And I feel kinda nervous, butterflies in my stomach
But I drift off to sleep, really thinkin nothin of it
Then something wakes me up, and I open my eyes
Somebody is in my house, I'm heartbroken cuz I
Couldn't tell my mom bye
They finally cought me slippin'
I'mma die like a man, homeboy I ain't trippin'

(Chorus 2X)
Gunhsots to my dome, jackers in my home
Nothin' too fancy just your average tombstone
I'm sorry that I choose the life under the cursed
I'll be dressed in a suit, finally going to church

(Verse 2)
Dreams of the cream, enemies on different teams
Red beams in my house, man this shit is so extreme
I saw 'em dressed up in all black, with the mask
And knew I they was comin' for the birds and the cash
So I rolled out my bed, hit the floor and stared crawlin
And this is the price you gotta pay when you ballin
But how did they get the spare key to my crib
It had to be my bitch, she gon' die if I live
Usually I keep a black Glock on my dresser
And I'm hearin someone whisper sayin, "Los ima get you"
And I know is the devil but I pay it no mind
But i've been dodging that fool ever since I was nine
Gotta make it to the closet, where I keep my mossberg
Slug shots, one hit, never speak another word
Little did I know they had night vision googles
When they saw me on the floor, boys squeezed on the throttle

(Chorus 2X)
Gunhsots to my dome, jackers in my home
Nothin' too fancy just your average tombstone
I'm sorry that I choose the life under the cursed
I'll be dressed in a suit, finally going to church

(Verse 3)
Shots started ringin' I was tumblin and diving
Running out of time with my mind on surviving
Dove out the window, but I started seeing stars
I forgot last week bought some burglar bars
Now my face is all wet, and I know it ain't sweat
Bullet hit my leg, so I rolled to my left
Guess where I was at? Damn right in the closet
Grabbed the pump, now it's my turn to make a deposit
Damn slugs ain't no punk, hit the boy in his back
Saw his right leg flying, and it knocked down my lamp
Unloaded, reloaded, it was a three men army
Now they looking like pinatas at the end of a party
One was still alive, so I started asking questions
He could barely talk, spitting blood like venom
He said he had a team, and that people would rent him
I killed the messengers now I need to send him

(Chorus 2X)
Gunhsots to my dome, jackers in my home
Nothin' too fancy just your average tombstone
I'm sorry that I choose the life under the cursed
I'll be dressed in a suit, finally going to church[Al Pacino, from "Scarface"]
This town like a great big pussy, just waitin to get fucked
I'm tellin you, I, I shoulda come here ten years ago
I'da been a, a millionaire by this time
By this time, I'd have my own boat, my own car, my own golf course
In this country, you gotta make the money first
Then when you get the money, you get the power
Then when you get the power, then you get the women
That's why you gotta make your own moves

[SPM]
I come from the under, bring the rain and the thunder
Double pumper a burnin' rubber in yo baby mother
Fuck supper, I'll eat yo bitch ass up for breakfast
In Texas, we blast first and then ask questions
Competition, all you can do is keep wishin'
You need to shut yo muthafuckin' ass up and listen
The prison system's winnin', a losin' battle
Puttin' hate in our heart, we got more beef than cattle
Mexicans killin' Mexicans I'm tired of you jealous men
Mad cause I'm movin' on up like the Jeffersons
Easy pickins, I made a livin' cookin' chickens
The sickest, now my flow is harder than my dick is
You bump your two lips and I'mma bust my two clips
That's two hollow tips to make you do two flips
Cause I'm a fool and a nut that really don't give a fuck
Buckle up and do a drive-by in my grandpa's truck

[Al Pacino, from "Scarface"]
Look, the time has come; we gotta expand
The whole operation, distribution
New York, Chicago, L.A
We gotta set our own mark, and enforce it
We gotta think big now

[Bing]
I got my mind on dollar signs, blowin' lime dimes of pine
My time to shine, you don't know Bing man he fine
Proceed to shine, and blind, dedicated to my rhymes
Top down, showin' spine, as I crawl on the grind
See I shut 'em down. Stop flexin' I'm bustin' rhymes
Bullet clips and slimes, you stop up at the stop sign
Think sharp like Einstein, syrup and crush combined
Drippin' paint on recline, keep my broads in line
Come and find these niggas swear to God they wreckin' the scene
I'm so tired like Al Green; oh you ain't heard about Bing?
Baby moma's on ding-a-ling, they exposin the G-String
Say they panties got wet, the first time that they peeped me
I ain't no ho, I sip 4's, get throwed and watch sports
Swangin' '84's, indo, blowin' 'dro on the road
Stackin' C-notes, makin' bitch niggas full of they own dope
'til the day that I go southeast in Grando fo sho

[Al Pacino, from "Scarface"]
I know all that bullshit, save your breath
You got nothing on me
You know it, I know it
I'm changing dollar bills
You wanna waste my time? Okay
Call my lawyer
He's the best lawyer in Miami
He's such a good lawyer
That by tomorrow morning, you're gonna be working in Alaska

[Grimm]
Woke up this morning, in a room that was padded up
Strapped to the bed, couldn't move, got me mad enough
I screamed at the top of my lungs, "Where am I, what have I done?"
They stuffed my mouth so I couldn't bite my tongue
Then they opened my arm and a needle stung
From the lithium the maximum sedation
Seven hours later I made a vague interrogation
They sayin' I burnt this man, and his wife, and they kids
It appears none of them lived, I can't remember if I did
But they insist that I'm the arsonist, claimin' that my part in this
Was that I doused the bodies in the dark and stayed up off of this
But not before I snapped the necks of each and everyone of 'em
Only cause it's cleaner than the runnin' up and gunnin' 'em
Then I stacked them up and grabbed the gas for the soakin' 'em
Actin' like they dead while the fumes was just chokin' 'em
Now it's comin' back to me, reality, that would be
Yes I set the fire that's beyond the common casualty

[Al Pacino, from "Scarface"]
What you think I am, huh?
What you think I am a fuckin' worm like you?
I told you already, I told you, don't fuck with me!
I told you, no fuckin kids, no but you wouldn't listen
[Gunfire], [scream], [splash][South Park Mexican]
(Verse 1)
All this time, you've been mine, heaven-sent Valentine
And just like that, my life stopped on the dime
I can't stop cryin'
Inside, I'm dyin'
I caught you red-handed
That's what I get for spyin'
But I've been suspicious
Cause you done caught me with some bitches
But you promised not to shoot me with the same triggers
You didn't know the new Benz I just bought you
Could be tracked by satellite
If that's how I caught you
Oh baby, why
In the past, I've been unfaithful
I can't believe it
I feel like
This nigga raped you
But you allowed it
You gave yourself to a coward
I'm a bury both of you
And still buy you flowers

Chorus: South Park Mexican
Remember when
Our love would never end
But now, I am
Tastin' my own medicine
Remember when
Our love would never end
But now, I am
Tastin' my own medicine

(Verse 2)
It's disturbin'
It's sick
I keep thinkin' 'bout this shit
I wanna spit
On your face, while you lie in a ditch
You forgave me
But I just can't forgive you
Cause it ain't the same
I can't explain it, but it's true
It's way worse
I never felt pain like this
I can't take you back, you fuckin' nasty ass bitch
You destroyed me
You ruined
Everything I worked for
A house with an elevator
A spa on the third floor
I still love you
But never in my life will I touch you
You disgust me
Your beautiful face became ugly
I just wish it was a dream
And that I could wake up
But it's real
So I keep
Gettin' drunk
As fuck

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
I'm home waitin' for you
You don't know that I know yet
You probably gettin' fucked right now
Sippin' some Moet
I checked the address
It's some dude named Paul
Thirty-three years old
Oh yeah
I checked it all
Probably met him at the mall
Spendin' up my cash
G-string up your ass
Wearin' tight ass pants
Oh my
Look who just pulled up in her Benz
"Where you been at, girl?"
"Oh, doin' some errands"
"Take your shit off
Let me smell you"
"What you thinkin' 'bout?"
"I know where you've been
Shut your motherfuckin' mouth
Whose house is this?
And who the hell is Paul?
What you mean this ain't a house?
This where you took the dog?
You mean
This the vetinarians's office?
You got the Parvo shots
For the puppy I just bought us?"
"It's some old man named
Dr. Paul Seigel
Here's the business card
In case I don't believe you
Call him up right now"
"Nah baby, that's okay
You know I trust you
I love you
That's all day
Why is my face red?
It looks like I've been cryin'?
Ha ha
Gangstas don't cry, baby
Don't even try it"

Repeat Chorus

[South Park Mexican]
Yeah
This song is dedicated for all you niggas fuckin' over the women you love
If she don't get you back
Your conscience will
And if she's not happy
Then you'll never be happy
That's just the way it goes
{*laughing*}
Yeah
It's the SPM
It don't never quitOooohh

Uh

It's the same ol' shit in the same ass place
My studio smells like ten ash trays
My nigga still gettin' too fucked up
And I'm still smokin' too much blunts
Haters always gon' run they mouth
And keep tryin' to take me out
Mama always gonna worry herself
And me I can't forget the pain I felt
Even though I drive a new 6 double 0
They be thinkin' like "What is Los frontin' for?"
I bought a club and they filled up with envy
Now every body pissed cuz they can't get in free
New enemies still poppin' up
Throw away gats still chop 'em up
I walk in and the whole club stands still
More money more problems that's real

This is what an ol' G told me
Filthy rich and dyin' lonely
"Fuck a benz and fuck a rolly, life is what you make it, homie."

This is what an ol' G told me
Filthy rich and dyin' lonely
"Fuck a benz and fuck a rolly, life is what you make it, homie."

My little baby-girl just turned 6
I gave her the biggest room in my crib
She gets what she wants so does her mama
I don't think they know the value of a dollar
Fine-ass bitches all in my limosine
I just wish I was jumpin' on my trampoline
But my babies I miss my children
To me that's worth more than trillions and trillions
She calls me "Fat-boy" says I'm "loco"
And she doesn't understand when I gotta go
Hope she doesn't think I don't wanna be wit her
Hope she knows that it hurts not to be wit her
Hope she knows that wit her I'm the happiest
I can't make it to her piano practices
When I was young my ol' man left us
And I pray dat she won't be like I was

This is what an ol' G told me
Filthy rich and dyin' lonely
"Fuck a benz and fuck a rolly, life is what you make it, homie."

This is what an ol' G told me
Filthy rich and dyin' lonely
"Fuck a benz and fuck a rolly, life is what you make it, homie."

Playa hataz wanna play me close
Do you really wanna meet Carlos?
Do you really wanna feel my wrath?
Mad cuz your bitch want my aut-o-graph
Nigga I don't wanna fuck yo' ho
But I'll let her suck my dick and lick my ass-hole (ha-hah)
Started out with a silly game of footsie
Now I got her eatin' out her best friends pussy
Rollin' hydro sippin' on Chris
When I was broke I would dream about this
Get my back rubbed in a big bath tub
I don't know her name but she's showin mad love
I got 7 G's sittin' in my pants
And my jewlry is underneath those lamps
I'm gettin' sleepy all you hoes gotta bail
Once again I'm in the bed by myself
All alone in another city
I get my bill the Chris was 9.50
2 G's for them bottles of Don P
It was just me and the hoes was free

This is what an ol' G told me
Filthy rich and dyin' lonely
"Fuck a benz and fuck a rolly, life is what you make it, homie."

This is what an ol' G told me
Filthy rich and dyin' lonely
"Fuck a benz and fuck a rolly, life is what you make it, homie."

Yeah, fuck a benz, fuck a rolly, family comes first, and I'm alone
Ye-e-e-eah
This is what an ol' G told me, He died lonely...[Chorus - Carolyn Rodriguez] X1
Is it real, tell me are we real?
Are you just sayin' things that I want to hear?
Are you really true?
Baby is it destiny?
Are you the one that god made and he meant for me?
Are we real?

[SPM, talking]
*Yea, this is a song I wrote for my wife, before she was my wife
We've been together 18 years now, that's like half my life
And she's still by my side. I love you, baby...*

[VERSE I - SPM]
You're love is beautiful, it's undisputable
You got me rappin' 'bout it up inside the studio
Like crazy, man, cause how I feel ain't normal
And I'm writin' in my journal, I hope it's eternal
I'm your favorite fan when you make an appearance
The smile on your face lifts up my spirits
I wanna' trust you and know that you'll be mine forever
You want a lifetime of love, that's what I'ma deliver
But, I worry a little; and I'm not sure why
But the thought of ever losing you blows my mind
And I know that I really shouldn't think that way
I guess what I'm trying to say today is baby...

[Chorus - SPM and Carolyn Rodriguez, X2]
Is it real, tell me are we real?
Are you just sayin' things that I want to hear?
Are you really true, baby is it destiny?
Are you the one that god made and he meant for me?

[VERSE II - SPM]
I don't mean to sound scared or even insecure
Usually I don't trip over chicks, but you're
Something else, something pure, and amazing boo
Mama raised a G, but didn't raise a fool
So I don't wanna lose you like I lost so many
Not really carin' 'bout a future and it cost me dearly
So many years as a playa' in a negative sense
And I guess it took this whole big set of events
To let me see things differently, I've grown as a man
And just wanna walk through life while holdin' your hand
Kiss you in the moonlight and touch your face
And let you know that you're the one that no one can replace

[Chorus - SPM and Carolyn Rodriguez, X2]
Is it real, tell me are we real?
Are you just sayin' things that I want to hear?
Are you really true, baby is it destiny?
Are you the one that god made and he meant for me?

[VERSE III - SPM]
I've broke many hearts in the days of past
And they told me one day one will break yours back
And avenge all the girls that you left in tears
But my heart was too hard to ingest those fears
So I ran through a bunch, some snack, some lunch
Some was dark, some was yellow like Captain Crunch
And we laughed a bunch, and we balled at malls
And if I could, I'd apologize to all of y'all
Saw the pain in her eyes as she begged me to stay
And, now, I truly understand how she felt that day
Cause now I feel the same and I want it to work
Hopin' I don't end up like the ones that I've hurt

[Chorus - SPM and Carolyn Rodriguez, X2]
Is it real, tell me are we real?
Are you just sayin things that I want to hear?
Are you really true, baby is it destiny?
Are you the one that god made and he meant for me?* send corrections to this typist

And twice on a Thursday
Blood thick than water
In pounds better than quarters
I smoking two joints
While I'm knockin down yo daughter
Dope House Records is on fire
So grab the estinguisher
I smoked out in the beamer
Bout to get emphezema
Gun slingers rap singers
With more stripe than the bengals
No need for the gang sign
I'm using my trigga finga

[Happy P]
Now won't you roll one
Po the four one
Sometimes I'm real selfish and I'll smoke my weed with no one
You know me
I'm young Happy P
Kick back aand blow a sweet
While my niggas move keys

Sippin corona with lima squeeze
And platinum P's
Only smoke on the fine leaves
I started out
Sellin five dollar tweets
And now I'm elevating
Sellin 5000 dollar beats

[Hook: Grimm]

I smoke two joints when I wake up
In the car I smoke two joints
I smoke two joints when in play video games
And every 10,000 points
I smoke two joints in time of peace
And two in time of war ar
I smoke two joints before I smoke two joints
And then I smoke two more

[Verse 2: SPM and Low-G]
[SPM]
Maan this killer herb got me runnin over curbs
And writing these raps full of misspelled words

Cause she like the twinkies that I slapped on my herse
I take two charges it's really quite harmless
The only side effect is that it makes you retarded ha ha
I started in 82
In fifth grade
You can say I was in high school
True smoka

[Low-G]
I got Mary at an early age
Con mi hermosa
Maria es mi esposa
Mi sanchas Nina Rosa
Mafiosa

Borracho de tu besos
Hoja pa mis huesos
Me trais pesos
Con hidea pa me seso

[Baby Beesh]
Now I be blowin when it's mo than one but less than three

Fools be sweatin me for that rush in the Lebanese
I be getting higher than the hills of Beverly Beverly

[Lil Bing]
Two joints be smellay in my Cadi
From the Valley to Cali
In the alley servin patties
Hastled by federales
Drippin candy
Sippin brandy
Twenty inches look fancy
On my way to the grammys
Hoes droppin they panties
Got a freak named Sandy
Makin hits like Sammie
I'm posted up with biscuits and chicken fried steak at Grandy's
Smashin off maan fo sho

Uh man

Niggas I know

Not makin' no dough
Cuffed by the po po
Look at what I started
You won't admit it though
Mad cause i move to fast
Ya just move to slow
Through all the hate

I illuminate whereever I go
I got a tight flow
But they won't say so
Man them boys know I'm busted
From Rimmy and Chateau
I got a phat house
With a little escrow
Got a 401K and a B.P.O
Now they wanna make movies,cds,and much mo
Didn't even had a dream before I knocked down doe
Call me head hancho
Labeled ceo
Nigga I'ma big shot rappers don't make doe
You'll never be nobody
We gonna call you John Doe
Yes I did ya ho
We gonna call her Jane Doe
She said I'ma might doe
Ya lovin' was so-so
Gave up ya publishin shea
And end up on Skid Row
I signed the whole industry
Won't admit that
First one to put out dirty.clean, and screw tracks
Created movies and sitcoms
No one remembers that
But ya'll be the first ones to down talk me
Ha how you love that
After all I did for ya
Is love too much toask fo
Some do give a little bit
But shit I need much mo

(Chorus: Heather Nicole)
Just a little love is all I need
You player haters never stoppin' me
Baller blockers won't you let me be
So haters step back and let us do our thing

(Verse 2: South Park Mexican)
SPM get death threats every day
Niggas  talkin' bout they want me walkin' memory lane
Let the jealousy rain
My enemies pain
Bitches mad cause I'm one step ahead of the game
Credible name
And I give the same
Just ya everyday hustler sellin' my game
I was left in the flame
Raised by mama
Now I know I'm coming up
Cause I done fucked Madonna
I'ma baller
Street scholar
Creep crawler
In a bloody body holler
I put dope on wax
Tapes and cds
Wake up every morning and smoke my weedies
We G's and if you hate it heres our quote
If my names in your mouth
Then my dicks down your throat
Don't choke ha ha
I love you haters
Cause if it wasn't for you

For real

(Chorus 2X)

(Outro: Heather Nicole)
Just just a little love

Just a little love is all I need(SPM)

My homeboys name is lil troy, me my name is Carlos Coy
Roll on tweenty two inch alloys, but that'll neva be my pride and joy
My lil girl she off the hook, make my ass stop and read a book

(SPM)
Screwston tx were I roam, bought me home off a telephone
Took my wife on a trip to rome, bought girlfriend silicone
That vanilla bone, in the killa zone, 5 foot nine with high heellas on
I sipp patron, flip my phone, left that pearl white bitch alone
Most my friends ain't around, dead, locked up, or just can't be found
I keep my lil girl safe and sound, daddy gonna buy a cinderella gown
And if that gown should disappear, heaven is real but it isnt here
You can't take no souviners, like those diamonds in your ears
Raised my daughter differently, cause the life I lived won't set me free
Write my list of enemies, and kill them hoes alphabetically
Uuhh

(Chorus)[Intro]
We got Angels all around (It‚Äôs going down fo‚Äôsho)
I was once lost but now I‚Äôm found

[Hook]
I got Angels on my shoulders (got angels)
You can‚Äôt brush em off of me
Imma ride cause I‚Äôm a soldier
And it sets my spirit free
I got Angels, you got Angels
We got Angels all around
Jesus save me
A new born baby (haha Yeaahh)
I was once lost but now I‚Äôm found

[Verse 1: SPM]
Father please help me with the lyrics at hand
I don‚Äôt wanna misrepresent the miracle man
But I gotta dedicated a very special song
To the one who gave me everything and kept me strong
From a child you protected me and I kept you busy
Sold so many times that it missed me
Thank you for my mom, my abuela and others
My babies, my lady and the worlds best brother
My friends, my fans, I call it my family
Everything good that I got, you handed me
My only big sister, she‚Äôs on top of my list
She taught me how to write poems and now it‚Äôs my gift
Her hand was heavenly
Since 1970
Every hug, every kiss, every book she read to me
My dad might of left but he was always around
He became my best friend, I will die for him now

[Hook]
I got Angels on my shoulders
You can‚Äôt brush em off of me
Imma ride cause I‚Äôm a soldier
And it sets my spirit free
I got Angels, you got Angels
We got Angels all around
Jesus save me
A new born baby
I was once lost but now I‚Äôm found

[Verse 2]
We all got Angels
Some you can see
I‚Äôm writing mine down I‚Äôm on 103
And I can keep on going till the end of my life
An incredible sight
An unforgettable ride
And it still ain‚Äôt over
Tho I‚Äôm deep in the struggle
You can still see my feet while I sleep on the rubble
Your boy still breathing and I ain‚Äôt trying to be even
Cause everything happens in this life for a reason
My heart is healing and my mind is seeking
My eyes are blinking and my rhymes are reaching
Every soul that is lost there is hope on the cross
People walk away like they don‚Äôt know what it cause
And I‚Äôm not saying that I‚Äôm any better than you
You will see for yourself if you stepped in my shoes
I ain‚Äôt blind but it‚Äôs times, I‚Äôm too stupid to see
But I just wanna show what Gods doing for me

[Hook]
I got Angels on my shoulders
You can‚Äôt brush em off of me
Imma ride cause I‚Äôm a soldier
And it sets my spirit free
I got Angels, you got Angels
We got Angels all around
Jesus save me
A new born baby
I was once lost but now I‚Äôm found

[Verse 3: SPM]
We all face obstacles and difficult times
We try to resolve them with our physical minds
Sometimes you gotta give us unreasonables
To him whom makes end possibilities possible
I know that it‚Äôs easier said then done
But just try your best and the rest will come
They gave me 45 long years up in prison
But I never let the tears interfere with my vision
I keep on moving, I can see things changing
I feel my soul strengthening and it keeps me patient
Knowing that I‚Äôm loved in a world so crooked
Jesus Christ died so the rest of us wouldn‚Äôt
There is only one truth and a zillion lies
That truth is NOT just for biblical times
And tonight, before I lay my head to sleep
Imma pray for the angels he sent to me

[Hook]
I got Angels on my shoulders
You can‚Äôt brush em off of me
Imma ride cause I‚Äôm a soldier
And it sets my spirit free
I got Angels, you got Angels
We got Angels all around
Jesus save me
A new born baby
I was once lost but now I‚Äôm found[South Park Mexican]
South Park from the heart, jump start the game
Everybody in my hood sellin' crack cocane
On my block, everything goes (Goes)
Diamond rings on my pinky toes (Toes)
Candy paint on my Cadillac ('Llac)
Who the fuck wanna battle rap (Rap)
Believe me you don't have a chance (Chance)
I come down like an avalanche ('Lanche)

(Verse 1)
Load the pieces with Reeses, watch out lo que me dices
I'm on the mic and Jaime's workin' the (???)
Dickie creases, fucked all your nieces
I eat 'em up for breakfast, they taste so delicious
Smoke fill rooms, poppin' mushrooms
I feel like I'm in a motherfuckin' cartoon
Sippin' on Red Rum
You should join us
A million haters, and they still can't destroy us
On the mic
I'm known to get it started
Cold hearted and half-ass retarded
Dearly departed, and those who got guarded
The young and the lost
Is who I'm tryin' to target
The sergeant's narcotics division is crocked
They found my bloody money and the motherfuckers took it
Whoop this nigga, then book this nigga
And they wonder why I such a ruthless nigga
You can act like you don't hear me
I know your listenin'
I hear you talkin' out the pot that you pissin' in
Street specialist respect my intelligence
I got gats that's made to drop elephants

Chorus: South Park Mexican
On my block, everything goes (Goes)

Twenty ounce Mountain Dew
Mix it with a two
With my nephew, smokin' Pepe Le Pew
Talkin' 'bout a doobie, don't think it's groovy
I'm a put him to bed like Sleeping Beauty
I told you once and I'm a tell ya twice
But I'm not gon' say this three or four times
You boys wanna play
We don't runaway
God damn, I forgot what I was gonna say
Something about .45's and Mack 11's
Desert eagles and AK-47's
Slice your throat just like a goat
You boys can't see me with a microscope
Kick down your door
Found your snow
Smokin' tough cause you had a fuckin' pound of dro
And after I jack all the birds in your kitchen
I hit the butt naked
Then go feed the pigeons

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
Crack hotels
Digital scales
Platinum necklace laced in Rockells
Shine my jewels
Buff my toe nails
Who kisses and tells, bees who sees hell
Smoke like a Rasta, watch the imposter
Who's at my door
A fucking Cookie Monster
Hasta la vista, bon appetit-sta
Twelve gauge shotty make your chest look like pizza
Call me Flintstone, land of Bedrock
I bought two clubs and a fuckin' restaurant
Take a journey
Where the boys dine too early
.45 underneath a nigga's Rockets jersey
Turn the table
Buck shots be fatal
Pigs handcuffin' my wrist, to my ankle
Mira muchacha, it's all about the raza
Burn my fingers, tryin' to smoke a cucaracha
They prejudice
That's why they don't play Mexicans
I get my dick sucked by my new receptionist
I started out with a hundred tapes
If you wasn't down then, get the fuck out my face

Repeat Chorus[Hook Carolyn Rodriguez] X1
Is it real, tell me are we real?
Are you just sayin' things that I want to hear?
Are you really true?
Baby is it destiny?
Are you the one that god made and he meant for me?
Are we real?

[SPM, talking]
*Yea, this is a song I wrote for my wife, before she was my wife
We've been together 18 years now, that's like half my life
And she's still by my side. I love you, baby...*

[VERSE I - SPM]
You're love is beautiful, it's undisputable
You got me rappin' 'bout it up inside the studio
Like crazy, man, cause how I feel ain't normal
And I'm writin' in my journal, I hope it's eternal
I'm your favorite fan when you make an appearance
The smile on your face lifts up my spirits
I wanna' trust you and know that you'll be mine forever
You want a lifetime of love, that's what I'mma deliver
But, I worry a little; and I'm not sure why
But the thought of ever losing you blows my mind
And I know that I really shouldn't think that way
I guess what I'm trying to say today is baby...

[Hook ÔøΩ SPM and Carolyn Rodriguez, X2]
Is it real, tell me are we real?
Are you just sayin' things that I want to hear?
Are you really true, baby is it destiny?
Are you the one that god made and he meant for me?

[VERSE II - SPM]
I don't mean to sound scared or even insecure
Usually I don't trip over chicks, but you're
Something else, something pure, and amazing boo
Mama raised a G, but didn't raise a fool
So I don't wanna lose you like I lost so many
Not really carin' 'bout a future and it cost me dearly
So many years as a playa' in a negative sense
And I guess it took this whole big set of events
To let me see things differently, I've grown as a man
And just wanna walk through life while holdin' your hand
Kiss you in the moonlight and touch your face
And let you know that you're the one that no one can replace

[Hook ÔøΩ SPM and Carolyn Rodriguez, X2]
Is it real, tell me are we real?
Are you just sayin' things that I want to hear?
Are you really true, baby is it destiny?
Are you the one that god made and he meant for me?

[VERSE III ÔøΩ SPM]
I've broke many hearts in the days of past
And they told me one day one will break yours back
And avenge all the girls that you left in tears
But my heart was too hard to ingest those fears
So I ran through a bunch, some snack, some lunch
Some was dark, some was yellow like Captain Crunch
And we laughed a bunch, and we balled at malls
And if I could, I'd apologize to all of y'all
Saw the pain in her eyes as she begged me to stay
And, now, I truly understand how she felt that day
Cause now I feel the same and I want it to work
Hopin' I don't end up like the ones that I've hurt

[Hook ÔøΩ SPM and Carolyn Rodriguez, X2]
Is it real, tell me are we real?
Are you just sayin things that I want to hear?
Are you really true, baby is it destiny?
Are you the one that god made and he meant for me?[SPM]
Hey Shetoro, uhm play me that lil latin beat
I wanna read this letter I wrote to my fans
In case I get killed or somethin'
I mean haha, I hope it never happens but
Damn it's just so many haters you never know, alright

[Verse 1]
As I read this letter and as you listen
I know right now I'm either dead or in prison
I'm writing this words as my daughter sleeps
I pray this is something I never have to read
The year is two thousand and I've signed with Universal
All the hate can't stop me but it still hurts though
The smoke in my blunt can only hide my pain
My security is outside but I still sleep in the rain
They say that my lyrics destroy and kill
But I'm only trying to tell them that I know how they feel
I never had both of my parents
I was three when he left, and ended the marriage
Most things I rap about, I no longer do
Tomorrow is church and after that is the zoo
Diamonds and cars don't make a man happy
Your jewels in life are your friends and family
The more money I make, the more problems appear
I feel my enemies are closing in getting near
Inspired by jealousy they wish me the worst
I shook the hands of men that want me stiff in a hearse
But everything I do, is so that one day
Our kids can see their own kind in a positive way
Although I'm no angel in God I do trust
I'd like to take a second to tell you about us
Rasheed is from Philadelphia, Low-G is from Honduras
I was raised with my guela in a place called Falfurrias
But we're all the same race and that race is player
I've held two jobs ditch digger and brick layer
Now I see a sign as I lay in the chalk
Heaven is seven million miles, Lord don't make me walk

Skies are dark and days are rainy
Houston, Texas blazin Janey
Things been kinda crazy lately
But they'll never fade my baby

[SPM: Verse 1]
Hard in the paint I don't think ya can stop me
Sell so much yay, boys call me Lil' Rocky
Guess what I bought me?An old ass jalopy
Slapped it out nasty, going down Scott street
Working on my tape, I'mma call it What Just Rate
Working on my movie, called Planets of the Dranks
I'm true to my hood, real with my patnas
Houston went Screwston that kinda shocked us, shocked us
Flip flop, white leather, bring it down at nice weather
I'm a big dice bedder, Polo on my tight sweater
It's the eye opener, strike like cobra
Pockets on swoll, I mean fat like Oprah
Bang to the boogie, the game getting uhugly
Roll with the bird just like the dog Snoopy
Rivals, punks trying to hold my title
You couldn't pass me on a muthafuckin' motorcycle

[Hook] - 2X

[Powda]
Shit ain't the way it use to be, baby things is kinda crazy
Be blazin on a Janey just to keep me sane
See this cats is acting shady but I promise they can't fade me
Too real to the game can't touch me or that SP
Like the birdman, why? Cause I fly in any weather
On the rainiest of days I still be doing better
Stacking chedda that's my mission, never cease no doubt
You can hate it you can love it, but you can't stop my route
I be reppin' to the fullest Dope House, ride or die
Don't test my soldiers, we don't click we familize
Damn the skies if they dark, cause we still gone shine
Every time we come around, we gone leave them boys blind
Stay high, I'mma keep my head up
Stay on my grind, I can keep my bread up
Never lead up playa, we ain't going no where
We some veterans in the game, been hustling for years

[SPM]
Dvd changer, stacker and a slanger
Bring her to the party with one in the chamber
Married to the cut, renew my vows
Walking down the isles in my pink crocodiles
I'm a scorer and a choppa, cook like Betty Crocker
Boys wanna knock me, but fuck a nigga knock'a
I'm the realest in this business, more ikas than a chemist
But the fear in hymnist, but got love like tennis
I'm a menace, squeeze triggas like lemons
I could win a rap contest with one sentence
And they jealous but I could show em' what hell is
I bring the rain and ya bring umbrellas
I'm restless, black lock, cock it back, aim and shoot
Nigga blowing up like some muthafuckin' Romen soup
Kandy coupe, I use to be too fat to hoop
Now I jump so high niggas think that I got magic shoes

Get the fuck out my face is what I suggest, cause I really don't think that you wanna test
This Mex
Comin' straight out the south east side of that Tex, so if there's
Something you gotta get off your chest, it's best that you don't express it
It's hard enough for a Mexican, so I really don't need all that plexin'
There's all kinds of player haters out there, so beware, let me tell you 'bout those
First, you got them fraud ass hoes
Then you got them fraud popo's
Then you got them fraud ass niggas in the street who just wanna plex and take yours

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 2: Low G]
Guess who's back, from the pen, out to win
Sipping gin, with my kinfolk
Gots the grin on
My face, when I come through
If you ain't down with these G's
Motherfuck you
Cause that's a straight up
Struggle in my barrio
Second Ward
Gettin' high on the patio
And when I'm wet
I'm a threat, to a rival set
I get respect
When I step
With my new tech
Don't sweat
I, check hoes daily
On the regular
Talkin' to your lady
On the cellular
Creepin' on the lowride
In the middle of the night
With no lights
And the .45
Chilling at the Dope House
Low G
Is something you don't know about
Little tricks
On my dick, 24/7
Treat them like a bitch
Still got them hoes beggin'
Keep it real for my people
I fear no evil
Stay high
Til I die, flyin' like a eagle

[South Park Mexican]
And as you know

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: South Park Mexican]
You're superficial
Talkin' 'bout life with a pistol
But you'se a ho, livin' life clean as a whistle
My missiles
Oh, they do leave body dimples
Attack your whole staff
Like a pack
Full of pitbulls
You simple
I'm complex
And comin' on next
Oh, take a wild guess
That South Park Mex
Spark sess, blow smoke in the darkness
You don't wanna start mess with the heartless
I be the smartest
Hottest
Artist
My GM shine brighter than the golden arches
Shootin' star, yes
Oh, trick
No, blow
Endo, before they kick door
Then flip coke
Tip-toe, to the top
Tellin' thug tales
Of wicked love spells
Hoes and drug sales
Some fell
In fact, it's most
So a toast to my niggas who died in the smoke

I warned y'all to stay of my genitals
Now I gotta turn you fruits into vegetables
Having nightmares, homie you ain't dead yet
Waking up with your motherfucking bed wet
I have fun with fucking punks like you
Tell his momma not to worry he'll be dead by Two
His head, impounded, they never found it
He in the dirt, you can say he got grounded
I'm a shouter, livin' how I tell it
And if you see him, tell him I said...

[HOOK x2]
They want to go, to bloody war
Are you sure you want to, take me to war[South Park Mexican]
(Verse 1)
I woke up quick
At around two
Jump in my Benz and pick up DJ Screw
Boys out there
Makin' them tapes
Separate the real niggas from the fakes
My boy just got out
Did a flat ten
And he just can't stop talkin' 'bout that pen
My best friend
But time destroys all men
Now he don't give a fuck about goin' again
It ain't all good, but I ain't missin' no money
I'm just a thug motherfuck, and you can't take nothin' from me
Somebody once said they wanna see me dead
The next week, they found the boy with two holes in his head
I break bread with my killers in the H-TX
It's the SP-Mex
In the all black stretch
Known for my purity, pride, and security
A house costs as much as one piece of my jewelry

Chorus: South Park Mexican
Cause the boys on the cut don't give a fuck
You come talkin' that shit
Your eyes get shut
Boys out there, slangin' that yay
Only pussy motherfuckers say that crime don't pay

(Verse 2)
The time has come
And the day is here
2001
Is my motherfuckin' year
I come from the head, it's the boy named Los
The one that got everybody on they toes
Straight up
And still, I sell dope for a livin'
In the form of a compact disc
Fuck prison
No more savin' cans
No more collectin' pennies
I'll have your fuckin' clique hollin' "Who killed Kenny?"
With my gangsta bitch
That, I just met
She ridin' my dick, chuckin' up her set
I dance with the wolves
This is for my hood
Got the whole World fiendin' for the dope I cut

Repeat Chorus Twice

Hook: Ayana M
Fire
We on fire
We ain't gone stop
Droppin' these bombs
Fire
We on fire
We ain't gone stop
Droppin' these bombs

(Verse 3)
I was twelve years old
When I did my first jack
And I don't think that bitch ever got her purse back
With fifteen rocks
I bought my first car
Cooked my first batch of dope in a pickle jar
It's like uno, dos, tres, young Happy Perez
Got me sellin' this dope to anyone on two legs
Boys talkin' down, but I give two fucks
Step in my face
I put you in an all black tux
Layin' in a casket
Hard as a rock
My lead
Hit ya head and make it snap, crackle and pop
Now, how many times do I have to tell ya
All my life, I've been called a failure
My freestyle flow
Is so untouchable
I just got out the county jail two months ago
Now I'm in the studio
Just like Julio
In the city where them bitches never won a Super Bowl
Man, I can't stop, I'm a keep on droppin'
Seven of my bitches at the same mall shoppin'
At the galleria
Tell me, have you seen her
I fuck a country singer and a Houston ballerina
Plus a fine ass China
I used to be a dreamer
Now I bought my mom and dad a navigator and a beamer
Leave a mark in this game
Aztec Indian
I don't give a fuck cause every month I make a million

Repeat Hook[Verse 1: SPM]
Now we sleep all day and party all night
I'm picking up my homie from the what, Northside
Tommys on my shirt, and nike's on my shoes
We rollin in the 'burban on them killa 22's
Hit the Southside, and pick up 2 twins
You can take Kelly's booty, I'ma do Kim's
Cops dont like me, not everyone agrees
I sag so low that my belts around my knees
Bass be boomin, make the girls butts wiggle
My girls gettin drunk and she's showin me her nipples
23rd and Sherman, I stop to get a sack
Sunday afternoon, I put Mason on the map
Cuz the dopeman got em in a 6-4 drop
Sometimes I'm on elbow, sometimes I'm on chop
Dopehouse Clique, and we all got cloud
Peace to DJ Lobo and my homie Bill Styles

(SPM)
Cuz my posse's is on Broadway...

(Rasheed)
I ride with my nigga, lie for my nigga
Smoke fry with my nigga, shine with my nigga
I'd die for my nigga, cry for my nigga
Stay high with my nigga, my nigga
My Nigga

[Verse 2: SPM]
Hanging with my niggas in the Hillwood Grove
Chickens in my kitchen cookin in my stove
Imagine I've been saggin ever since I could walk
Been beggin you to listen ever since I could talk
Double-in my money, even make it triple
I've never been a bum, but I'm beggin for a nickel
Still dippin sticks with a throwed ass bitch
Workin those lips, but I dont mean a kiss
Roll with fuckin killers, we all got straps
Walkin through my hood with a woodgrain mac
Slip em in a coma, slangin on my cut
It took alot of work to get my block so crunk

(SPM)
Cuz my posse's on Broadway...

(Rasheed)
I eat with my nigga, sleep with my nigga
Cook beef with my nigga, Creep with my nigga
On feet with my nigga, drink with my nigga
Pack heat with my nigga, my nigga
My Nigga

[Verse 3: SPM]
Now we back in population, we all got straps
Run around town, in trophy trucks and 'lacs
The wheels keep turnin, I'm choppin up the wind
I see the ladies lookin, they wanna jump in
Now the front ends hoppin and the car begins to dance
My 40 ounce bottle, is spillin on my pants
Ridin too deep, in the 4-door '77
I'm tryin to count my TV's, I think i got eleven
Now we all got love for the '63 Impala
Ruby is the short one, claimin Guatemala
Bobby is the mix-breed, people think he's funny
Behind us in the Cougar and he's hoppin like a bunny
Bird's keep flyin, I feel like a Hawaiian
Cuz my backyard looks like an exotic island
Creepin Harrisburg, the party broke left
I make a U-Turn, 'cuz I'm BROADWAY TO MY DEATH

(SPM)
Cuz my posse's on Broadway...

(Rasheed)
I roll with my nigga, smoke with my nigga
Fuck hoes with my nigga, blow with my nigga
Buy clothes with my nigga, throw with my nigga
Cook dope with my nigga, my nigga
My Nigga
I chill with my nigga, deal with my nigga
Pop pills with my nigga, steal for my nigga
I'd kill for my nigga, feel my nigga
On wheels with my nigga, my nigga
My Nigga

SOUTH PARK'S IN THE MOTHERFUCKIN HOUSE YA'LL
SOUTH PARK'S IN THE MOTHERFUCKIN HOUSE
SOUTH PARK'S IN THE MOTHERFUCKIN HOUSE YA'LL(*gunshots*)
SOUTH PARK'S IN THE MOTHERFUCKIN HOUSE!![SPM]
Yeah, I ain't got no hook for this jam
Here we go, here we go
I'm just gonna let ya, feel the music on the hooks
Knahmsayin'

[Verse 1]
In the rancho everybody knows Carlos
Still writing, still fumando arbols
I'm locked up with my gente, no hay salida
Trying to finish up this book about my vida
On appeal and it's gonna take a full year
They asking me, if I wanna go to school here
At a time when a person really needs a friend
I'm thinking bout getting back on them streets again
I gave the Benz to Happ and the Vet to Beesh
I hope they use 'em to ride on my enemies
I got two left, whaz up young Hugh Heff?
I heard my brother just signed up a new cheff
Lucky Lu the Screwston freestyla
Ya just wishing that the Dope House would die, huh?
I heard ya boys talking down, bumpin lips
But big mouths is only good for sucking dicks
When I was free none of ya step to me
Now that I'm locked, you hoes is disrespecting me
I'll be back before you bitch niggas count to ten
But I can touch you, way before I'm out the pen
No names, I don't play that silly game
You smoking too much weed, you ain't no killa maine
I bring vengeance, can't put it all in one sentence
But if there is a hell, I can show you to the entrance
Mothafucka, oh yeah
And this shit don't stop
I told you they can't stop it
Here we go, two verses

[Verse 2]
Everybody's day comes, I fuckin' ate crumbs
I'm not a star, but now I date some
Those who new me, as a child growing up
See me Benz turn around and start throwing up
What'cha think? That I'm happy cause a new car
Ya'll come to me sayin' "I don't care who you are"
I knew you when you wasn't nothing and still ain't
You just Carlos Coy but on a lil tape
You think you bad with your big house and fancy ride?
But a man is only good for what he has inside
So I say, "then why are you so mad?"
Have you ever heard of me to go brag?
On this earth I'm no betta than any body
I was more happier without any money
I haven't changed not one little bitty bite
To be honest ya the ones who really did
Hatin me, cause you live in misery
But theres other ways of takin kicks and dissin me
No revenge, I just want my family and friends
Fuck the Benz and you can have the millions
All I want is a worm and a finishing pole
Behind bars is the little things you miss the most
All the parties, the clubs they don't mean nothing
I miss telling little kids they can be something
Give 'em hope cause I know they up against the odds
Tell 'em do they best, leave the rest to God
Man I know they make you feel like you don't belong
Can't see your own kind only shows this song
Lil homie that's only cause they scared of us
Don't play me, they say cause I bare too much
I'm not negative but trying to be a pessimist
But your fear got you hatin' on the Mexicans

[Carolyn Rodriguez]
Fuck these jealous hoes, playa hatin' hoes
They fuckin' with my Los, oh
I gave you my whole life, my body and my mind
My love and my time, you know I'll rise
Oh it's Dope House that's for life
I told you bitches once
And now I'll I tell you twice
It's Dope House for life, the home of the brave
These hater's cannot play, you can try it your own way
And see your day
For all my G's on lock, for those who rep they block
For those whose in the box
You know, we don't stop[Verse 1]
In the rancho, everybody knows Carlos
Still riding, and still fumando arbos
Im locked up with my gente, no ay salida
Trynna finish up this book, about my vida
On appeal and it's gonna take a full year
They asking me if I wanna go to school here
At a time when a person really needs a friend
I'm thinking 'bout getting back on them streets again
I gave the Bens to Hap, and the Vet to Beesh
I hope they use 'em, to ride on my enemies
I got two left, what's up Young Hugh Hef
I heard my Brother just signed up a new chef
Lucky Lu, the Screwston freestyla
Y'all just wishing the Dope House would die huh?
I heard you boys talking down, bumping lips
But big mouths, is only good for sucking dicks
When I was free, none of y'all stepped to me
Now that im locked, you hoes is disrespecting me
I'll be back before you bitch niggas count to ten
But I can touch you, way before im out the pen
No names, I dont play that silly game
You smoking too much weed you ain't no killer mayne
I bring vengance, can't put it all in one sentence
But if there is a hell I can show you to the entrance

...

[Verse 2]
Everybodys day comes, I fucking ate crumbs
Im not a star, but now, I date some
Those who knew me, as a child growing up
See my Bens turn around and start throwing up
What y'all think that im happy cause a new car?
They come to me saying "i dont care who you are!
I knew you when you wasn't nothing, and still ain't
You just Carlos Coy but on a lil tape
You thik you bad with your big house and fancy ride?
But a man is only god for what he has inside"
So I say that why are you so mad
Have you ever heard of me, to go brag?
On this Earth im no better, then anybody
I was more happier without any money
I haven't changed, not one little bitty bit
To be honest, y'all the ones that really did
Hating me, cause you live in misery
But there's other ways to take your kids and dissing me
No revenge I just want my family and friends
Fuck the Bens and you can have the millions
All I want is a worm and a fishing pole
Behind bars its the little things you miss the most
All the parties, the clubs, they dont mean nothing
I miss telling little kids they can be something
Give them hope cause I know they up against the odds
Tell em do they best, leave the rest to god
Man I know they make you feel like you dont belong
Can't see your own kind on the shows this on
Lil homie thats only cause they scared of us
Dont play me they say cause I bear to much
Im not negative but trynna be a pesamist
But your fear's got you hating on the mexicans

[Outro: Carolyn Rodrigues]

Fuck these Jealous hoes, Player hating hoes, Fucking with my own, I give you my whole life
Body and my mind, In My Time, You know Alright, Oh its Dope House thats for Life

Home of the brave, You can try it in your way, And see your day, Dope House G's dont lie
Those who still love us, You know we still gonna shine...[Hook]
Chiefin' on good and Grippin' on Wood
This for my partners, this for my Hood
Pockets on Fat, the Trunk is on Crack
84's pokin' out the new 'lac
(x2)

[Verse 1: South Park Mexican]
Ta Da
Look who Back
With them 84's pokin' out a brand new 'lac
Super duper car, I pull a superstar
You gon' look, I don't give a fuck who you are
See my rims gon' shine, and the bitch gon' mind
And when I chuck it out the roof, deuce goin' blind(?)
Got trees to blow, and they ease my soul
And Probably by tonight I'm gon' need some more
I'm rollin' with a 10, my thick yella friend
Said she had a man but never mentioned it again
Fabulous times, 'til I'm packin' my 9
Cause you know how mo' fuckas get to action at time
Now I'm in it from the Back, I'm in it from the Front
I think I hit her kidney cause I felt that bitch jump
This is how we do in the town blessed by Screw
Shinin' on Martin Luther King Avenue

[Hook]
Chiefin' on good and Grippin' on Wood
This for my partners, this for my Hood
Pockets on Fat, the Trunk is on Crack
84's pokin' out the new 'lac

[Verse 2: South Park Mexican]
Ta Da
One more again', you now listen to the sounds of the SPM
From a jet black hood, but all bets good
Sunny Side, South Acres, Cloverland, Hillwood
Let the seat Recline, all I see is the Dash
Just tell me when to turn baby, we won't crash
Screwtown, Screwtown, city of dreams
What I love about you, a million things
Sippin' syrup n sizzling, purple Promethazine
Goin so slow like we rollin' in limousines
Soon as I hit the scene, a nigga get triple teamed
Bitches starin' at me like they dyin' to kiss a king
They wanna be Billie Jean and try to combine
Nine months later say his eyes look like mine
Dime in the prime, but I'm MOE, PIMP, SPOG

[Hook]
Chiefin' on good and Grippin' on Wood
This for my partners, this for my Hood
Pockets on Fat, the Trunk is on Crack
84's pokin' out the new 'lac(JC)
We had met, through a friend and then (uh huh, uh huh)
Thought we'd be together to the very end (uh huh, uh huh)
My partners told me you was about that dough (uh huh, uh ha ha)
But when they said it I was like hell no
Cause I knew that you was so special (so beautiful)
Started seeing signs but I wouldn't let go (uh, uh)
You complaining about my money cash flow (what)
Said it was a what, a bit too low (too low)
You was tripping on my boy's tahoe (uh huh, uh huh)
And told me why can't you be like that balling negro

(Chorus)
I loved you, I couldn't live without you
My life was all about you, and that just wasn't cool enough
And now I'm back door, and rolling in my benzo
On 22 Lorenzo, and now you want to call me up

(JC)
Do you recall a trip to NYC (remember that)
I spent all the money that I made that week (working hard for my dough)
38 alums on my 9 to 5
No matter how I tried your ass was never satisfied
Go back in town and I'm driving us home (already)
Stop at the light and you jocking someone's clothes (what you looking at)
I knew right then it wouldn't be me (uh huh)
Relationship was history (out the door)
I just can't bring me back for no it watching h-o-e

(Chorus)

(South Park Mexican)
High priced hoochie, love that coochie
But I won't sit back and let a broad use me
Too much cash in my jeans left pocket
In the VIP blowing kill with the Rockets
Baller shot caller, sipping alcahola
Dopehouse after-party, everybody follow
Don't trip, I got it real sick now-a-days
Six police that be earining they pay
Breaking up fights, and shining they lights
Take them all to jail till they learn to be nice
Jose, and my boy Mario
Brought a truck full of bud, we gone party yo

(Chorus)"Cool Enough"
(feat. JC)

[Hook][E.S.G.]
Just cause we live in the country
Doesn't mean that we slow

[Mikee]
Hey
Hey
Country life
Southern strife
What gives you the damn right
To come pointin' fingers down at me
My life is so, slow

[Verse 1: E.S.G.]
I live that C-O
The U-N
The T to the R to the Y
The E to the S to the G be screamin' south side til I die (South side)
See I ride
With Carlos, should I say the SPM
A six-three
Hot to be, I almost cracked my damned rims
I swang and bang, I do my thang
Mary Jane be in my brain
Codeine in the cup
Got 20"s in the truck
Hold up
Country life, we got horses and chickens
But our chickens transform
Into ounces in the kitchen
I ain't snitchin'
I'm spittin' on what we do in southern life
Candy cars, ghetto stars, we sip and ballin' all night
Shootin' dice, bangin' and breakin', and doin' my thang, all night
I paid the price
To have my teeth filled with ice
Look twice, you might get blinded by the way my diamonds glistenin'
E.S.G.'s who I be
Boy, I'm country like chitlins
Eatin' cornbread, I'm gon' fed, Kenny Red ain't no joke
A Last Resort like Papa Roach
Pass the sweet and let's smoke, cause, uh

Chorus: Mikee
Country life
Southern strife
What gives you the damn right
To come pointin' fingers down at me
My life is so
Hey, hey
Country life
Southern strife
What gives you the damn right
To come pointin' fingers down at me
My life is so, slow

[Verse 2: Mikee]
Got to keep, on truckin' baby, to the end
Cause we got to make it through
You see I know these KKK's
They on my trail
They searched my room
Country life ain't all what it seems
And
Some of y'all think it's a motherfuckin' dream, but I got
Many problems on my mind
My weed tolerance is down
And I can't get high
Besides that
It's hot as hell outside
The temperature keeps on risin'
And I ain't got A/C in my ride
I don't abide
I ain't the one
I ain't the dumb
Country man that you really think I am
Country life

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: South Park Mexican]
I'm the country bumpkin, comin' out the south-uh
Rascal like Spanky and Bash is Alfalfa
Pull it up, out ya
Ki's in my couch-ah
Eight in my fam, I don't give a damn about ya
Yowza, yowza, I sleep with the cows-ah
Rattlesnakes and crickets in my overall trowsers
Got my own stable
Own record label
Sittin' on the table, eating steak and potatoes (Sip)
Sippin' on syrup
Pickin' your girl up
Take her to my trailer and she make my toes curl up
Silence them boys when they see my toys
My dooley
On twenty-two inch chrome alloys
Got a 'Burban that I stretched to fit twenty-four people
Call me Chico with security that look like Deebo
I used to hang in clubs sellin' tapes in the restrooms
Now I float in the boat with six bedrooms

Repeat Chorus
