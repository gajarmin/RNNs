Hello. My name is Mary Jane
Also known as cannabis sativa, pot, weed, and hip
I am what your parents used to place in white sheets of paper
No, not note book paper, joint paper
Yes I'm pretty popular
My body can transform into many forms so I am typically the color green
like the Grinch
I am the present hidden under the tree
I bet most of you in this room have tried to make a whore out of me
But i have simply pimped you in choosing my three leaves over the trinity
My scent is a mix of Christmas trees and overcooked over ren baker
when most people meet me they break me into pieces and discard my seeds
laying me to rest in a swisher sweet colored casket
the flick of a lighter ignites me
contring up my spirit to make it's way into yours i am nothing more
the commercialized voodoo and you are my harry pot-ters
you know I'm sort of an activist
before the marijuana tax act of 1937 i was completely legal
no handcuffs on my buds, no shackles on my stems
little do these people know how much i can do for those i need of my help
i abolish the pain of AIDS and Cancer patients while amplifying the flesh
making every sin you could ever conceive
more desirable than the apple dangling like death on the tree in the sight of Eve
why do you think everytime you take a puff of me you get greedy like the hustlers in your stomach
I cause the munchies, everybody loves the munchies
even though the munchies is just a cute word for gluttony
I am better at feeding you sin than Satan is
Hey hey hey, its also been said i can help those with Glaucoma
everybody has the right to see right?
take one hit of me and watch your eyes become x-rays undressing every person you see
helping you rape fornicate and sodomized men and women with your blinks
lust is simply a sinly side affect that comes along with me and its funny
that those who allow lust to take over their soul got stoned to death go figure
thats the reason why your eyes are the color of red rum when you are drunk off me
i am a murderer in disguise but nobody dies from weed
the leading cause of preventable death in America is tobacco not me
but your idolatry of me is killing you soft and slowly like the Fugees on repeat you
consistently seem me over the author of your breath you breathe in my Satanic love when you are thirsty for
comfort and peace when you are lonley you let me sing you lullabies with my lies when you are
hurt you cry while feasting on my pipes and bones you and your friends
can't seem to see the suicide you commit every time you do a shotgun
woah woah woah, first of all, its not that serious
second of all, if I'm legalized, i can save the government up to $10-15 billion a year
first of all its eternally serious, second of all lets do the math God is eternal
infinite meaning he has no beginning no end there is no number ascribed to him
God is holy man is not, sin is a direct slap in the face of God in which he created
in honor of him every puff puff pass is storing up a measurable wrath on the hand of the transgressor
hypothetically speaking lets say every sin costs a million dollars
i tend to produce less greed hate pride idolotry laziness sexual immorality
munchies i mean gluttony with every person i come in contact with literally that means for
every joint pipe or bone smoked you reckoning $9 million a high
if you were to smoke a blunt a day for 365 days you will end up making
$3,285,000,000 in sin a year for every year you are with me against a holy infinite and righteous God
which you are expected to meet on judgement day you cannot afford to love me
i was not made for you to replace me with the creator
I am not God but didn't God create marijuana?
all weed heads are doing are simply making use of his high in art work
so we should apply that concept to everything God created
Child molesters shouldn't be penalized because they are simply making use of children
with forced intercourse right? Until the earth is flung through the sky i will continue
to justify my lies by helping you to pervert the true purpose of my conception
the truth is i cannot help you, i cannot cure you, i cannot give you peace and joy
i cannot comfort you i am only temporary can't you see i am as fickle as a Schizophrenic therapist
i make you feel good for 15-30 minutes then i leave you with the same emotions with you as you came
so i know you will come back to me how desperate can you be
i hit you and quit you every time you smoke me
you have made me into your master and willingly became my slave
the evidence of your bond to me is in the cotton growing inside of your mouth
every time you kiss me don't you see we are not made for each other
a lot of you know me this way but not many of you know the real me
this is the real me, this is reality, i am more than mary jane
i am the ressurrected Jekyll Hyde
and there are two faces of every high
i am either extremely evil
or wonderfully good
and what is good can seem evil and what is evil is excellent at looking good
which side of me you want to believe is for you to choose
lovers of me will not suffer from lung disease but they will all suffocate on deception
this has been a PSA announcement from mary Jane
and i hope i have officially blown your high[Verse 1: Jackie Hill Perry]
How you feel about seeing babies on the street with the heat
Who eats when it's beef and it's cold out
North Poles, no clothes when it goes down in the city
Inner city ain't a bit a pretty
Coppers missin' robbers just to get a penny
Justice system sicker than the intervention given to individuals with limited images
With intimate visuals of the Most High
Most die in this jungle, watch the crows fly
I grow tired in the summer when the bones rise
The chrome cried in his stomach when his soul died
How many murders in a hour? Prolly 4-5
Only time they got power when they hold 9s
It only took 3 days for the one to rise
I know they tired of walking crooked cause they lookin' blind
They want power they will find it when they put it down
It's up in heaven name 'em 7 in a daze cause they weaker than they realize
Tell 'em life ain't ours don't waste time
Tryna find life in everything that's finna die
Don't let 'em lie to 'em
Give 'em evidence of heaven when you ride through 'em
We gotta tell 'em it's something better in heaven
Embedded in everything ever seen ever been evident excellent
And it's God

[Hook: Eshon Burgundy]
I overcame that novacane
I was numb to the shots from that gun
I was livin' so insane, oh I'm so ashamed
But I'm done livin' life on the run forever
The moment you realize that this is realer than it seems
Wish you could open your eyes and realize it's all a dream
I wanna wake up, I wanna wake up
From this nightmare, I wanna wake up
But I'm right here when I wake up, when I wake up

[Verse 2: Eshon Burgundy]
In the city of death
Looking for the tree of life in a pair of 23 Nike's
Blessed that I'm looking for it in the first place
Could be a different scenario, the worst case
Take an aerial shot of my block, see the Glock of an officer pop a kid
That's how it is in the ghetto metropolis
Way before the introduction of stop and frisk, it was killer
Hopeless, a dream deferred
Fiend drop a dope dish and a needle by the curb
Heroin is a heroine, a deliverer, a savior, a medicine for some
Cold night, cold pipe full of hot fire
Prayin' to the dope god they don't even know God
How many killings in a night Jackie 4-5?
I took 3 shots that was back in 95'
Nowadays they'll kill for a G-Shock
Trigga, click, boom-bang, soundin' like a beat-box
Thank God for God though
Take a hoodlum and turn him to an apostle
Turn a simple brush stroke into a Picasso
Turn the death of His only Son into the Gospel, that's deep!
That should let you know that true love is not cheap
I oppose what false prophets preach in the street

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jackie Hill Perry]
I hear the blood of Abel screamin' from the streets
When it speaks we don't hear it but we fear it from his own mouth
Bullets rippin' through a whip just for listenin' to hits
The heart with tints was darker than the car parked with kids
I wonder if the heart was skin
Bullets looking for darkest sin
Who's the target then? It's all of us
We Paul bearers, we all lovers
We all jealous when Paul tell us we all zealous for death, Russian roulette
Click click who's next, is it you?
Did a witch put a hex on the youth?
Kaleidoscope triggers seeing colors when they shoot
Put the text in they chest, red letters in they roof, look up
Sign language to the deaf
And it's proof that the hands take command when dark ain't rebuked
Feet of the beast in the belly of the streets tryna eat
But the Priest shed His blood for the food

[Hook]

[Verse 4: The Problem - Jackie Hill Perry]
Look up in the sky, I spy a timeline of blind vultures
Blind rhymes style the fabric of the timed culture
Soaked in Satan's lies, find another kinda lotion
Cloaked in a disguise, signed the dotted line, it's over
I told 'em find another ride cause this roller coaster’s stolen
Goin' to a fate you won't believe, hocus pocus
Throwin' dreams in the face of Zzz 'till he woken
Growin' MCs that sow the seeds of heaven's roses
Rosen, risen, He did it, death is slaughtered
Our daughters barterin' souls for attention
Oughta be heard if the only audible row would listen, itchin' for words
Lotta research goin' towards a hole and they dig it
Gotta be words flowin' for heavens sake of the mission
Owin' nobody nothin', them bluffin' bustas are finished
This pen ain't pension the mentions what sinners don't wanna deal with
Filled with the vision of slaves, lynch 'em for tinted pigment
See that bus? Get in the back and act like its proven
That academics do actually lack in the black communion
Schools are lackin' the facts, lackin' the staff, they foolish
They plastic wrappin' the masses
The masters grabbin' they nooses
Bastard habits from lackin' the happy daddy influence
They ratta-ta -tat-tat, and they clap at the back of children
They action backwards, they blacker than the backward task of Judas
Laughter is the reaction when I ask if they master Jewish
Laughter is the reaction, ask if they master Jewish
Go backwards a little faster past the actions of Judas
Go forward a little more and last 'till the masters through
And they graspin' the massive truth that surpasses the attitude
That Adam's passive pursuit when he was passed the actual fruit
It ain't over 'till the fat lady sings, go grab a flute
Sax playing the soundtrack of demons singing the blues
Holiday with molly the same as cane with a different hue
A dope-a-rope generation, an Ali kinda rebuke
The violent is silent, the pilot tried to remind you you
Only one thing is true, honey what you gon' do?
Money is at the root when they come lookin' for you[Hook: Swoope]
What I'm finna quit for?
You see me living like a king
It's still 1-1-6 bruh
Oh Lord! working for the same team
I think I need a ad-lib from Diddy!
Cause Imma take that to each and every city
Homie, Imma take that, take that(X5)
I think I need a ad-lib from Diddy!
Cause Imma take that to each and every city, homie Imma

[Verse 1: Swoope]
Lecrae sell a million records
And my name don't get mentioned in the review
It don't matter, get the W
Cause even players on the bench get rings too (get rings)
Way deep is what the crew is
On the same team, all running the same play
So you need to check your motives if you're doing this
If you was mad Andy sold 28k ah!
Taking away from the mission
All this division don't add up
It all equals dissension
Ya' ask me that's bad math bruh
So yeah, I'm on Collision, but really I am indifferent
If you 116 and independent
No, you King livin', junkie dream itchin'
Humble coffee bean sippin'
Long as the mission and the team don't seem different

[Verse 2: Jackie Hill]
Humble Beast is a piece of a piece
Like a finger missing little little Richard
With the scream but it's singing kinda simple with the keys
Kinda tripping playin' notes
Trying to listen can you hear it?
Oh you don't, cause your ear's with your feet
Kinda different when the body ain't complete, huh?
What's the difference if the body don't compete huh?
That's a team picture
IG it when you see us

[Verse 3: Taelor Gray]
I just follow my marching orders
Beg your pardon?
Tell me how I went from dead to pardoned
Don't tell me how to testify
I'm a wretch with an extra life
That's how I continue
Word to JGivens Bienvenue
I'm killin' everything on the menu
That's same team
Grab a utensil, we eat!

[Hook: KB]
What I'm finna quit for?
You see me living like a king
It's still 1-1-6 though
Oh Lord! Welcome to the same team
I think I need a adlib from Diddy!
Cause Imma take that to each and every city
Homie, Imma take that, take that(X4) (Aaahh!)
I think I need a ad-lib from Diddy!
Cause Imma take that to each and every city, homie Imma

[Hook]

[Verse 4: JGivens]
Humble as a mumble in the jungle of shouts and screams
Digging tunnels under a stampede, beast!
Okay-kay keep, praying for the grace we stay cold but never freeze
Like water at four-four blap-blap degrees
Uhhh, fahrenheit, where was I, dare if I share a terabyte
We don’t care if you verified
Your lil' brand is just a fraction
In the middle of a grain of sand
Or the hand of a master crafter of sand castles
With the passion, imagine, decapitating dragons
We are just a vapor on paper on another vapor of a microcosm of a remnant of minions
Running like Kenyans like Obama
Irrepentance to the Father
Better warn the town the beast is loose
And you on the same team
If the dreams from the same king
If it floats from the same stream
If it don’t then it's gangrene (chop)

[Verse 5: Alex Faith]
I think I kinda feel it, no competition
Smelling like team spirit, Nirvana
No Cobain, we blow brains when they ain't wanna hear it
Same team we cliqued up now
40 deep won't switch up, ha!
I stay two to the left and one to the right
Got the kings ridin' with me when we take it to the mic
Comin' from the bottom of the map and they're know we're comin'
Unashamed shawty cause I ain't afraid to show it
If it's southern California or it's dirty dirty Dallas
Keep it slappin' in the Bay dog you know we gotta shout it
Gotta switch it up like gang sign speak
We take it all over every place I be
We bring it to the church
But don't hate on me
Cause every now and then you gotta show ID
I beast!

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Asaiah Ziv]
Oh look who they let out the cage
They ain't wanna hear it from a kid underage
Said he tryna get plates
Give the boy a little grace
I'm tryna be the light-skinned Puerto Rican MLK
With a little bit a Dilla and a little bit of Lupe
From the Cooday straight  from a runaway slave
Now I'm free with a fee that's already been paid
Give the boy a little grace
1-1-6 give 'em 16, ate 16
Had a dream now I'm 18
Give 'em 8 bars
66, we a problem
Get a solved for your number gain
Working for the same team
Why we tryna floss when we all got the same gleam
They say the sheep's gettin' lost
A mirage for the cause cause the sound's getting mainstream, uh!

[Hook][Verse 1: JGivens]
Count sheep
Now enter a dream
Of a scepter held by an expert Shepherd
And He do the same thing
But for these sheep it seems like it's 1-2-3
Keep falling on me
Now honestly think
Would you ever depend on attention-deficit sheep
That continue to think they could peep with the Shepherd and His network
"Let him eat give him new fleece"
They want a sweatshirt
Or when they eat so they struggle to read
And every other week it's an excerpt from an internet verse
On a meme or a t-shirt or a mass text
Fast-food eating little sheep
Try and lecture
But they walk weak with a limp like a Fred Durst
Who gonna confess first?
No no doubt or don't speak
There's a lamb in silence with a Hannibal (bull)
And he should give it all to the lector
And ask the Shepherd so dare I try
I'm Jeremiah the bulimic sheep who don't eat
I just say I'm tired and go to sleep paralyzed
Like what if my legs are a pair of lies
I count real well and I stand disguised
Cat with a little bit of fear is a whole lot of pride can you feel me
Started from the bottom like Wheelchair Jimmy
Now I'm trying to get verified
Who cares? God, where was I?
Confessions to the God of Jacob changed my makeup
And give me grace when I wake up

[Hook: Natalie Lauren]
In the morning comes the simplest of pleasure
Eyes wide open to the sight of treasures
But you gotta see something better
Better
Than stuff around you
You gotta see something better
Better better
Little pretty treasures trying to drown you out

[Verse 2: Jackie Hill Perry]
I wake up and I think
Does an artist seek
The canvas or the paint
He makes the brush blush plus
He loves what he can't obtain
I guess he's drawing a blank
It's nothing
An idiom made him something
David Blaine can't change
I tricked you
You reading the surface of this puzzle
The struggle is beneath. It's deep. I'm shallow
It's like I want what I see
But I can't get past my shadow
My need competes with me
I wanna battle
The snake's awake now
My trophy's rattle
I'm done with riddles
The truth is simple
I wake up and Folgers fold me into something fickle
In other words, what's brewing is my ruin
It's simple
The music of my morning has no Word
Hear the instrumental
Of the lies of self-sufficiency
I'm living like I've been complete
Tweeting before I speak to King
Or Mordecai with better dreams
It's better things than sight
'Cuz I was made for this
If mirrors make me happier than Christ
Then I'm an atheist. It's fact or fiction

[Hook: Natalie Lauren]
In the morning comes the simplest of pleasure
Eyes wide open to the sight of treasures
But you gotta see something better
Better
Than stuff around you
You gotta see something better
Better better
Little pretty treasures trying to drown you out

[Outro: Natalie Lauren]
Don't ever leave my side
You're all I wanted, need inside
It's your love
It's you
It's your love
It's you
It's you, it's you
Never leave, never leave me
Never leave, never leave me[Hook]
God, You're making me better
You're making me better
And You choose to do it however, whenever, wherever
(x4)

[Verse 1]
You don't know what I've been through, don't know what I've been through
When the pain cuts deep, cuts deep
You would think it was jiu-jitsu
And with me as the meat on the menu
Instead of peps with the meat from the temple
Trying to find joy in the midst, this don't seem that simple
Cause I do what I don't want to do when what I don't want I do
And I do what I don't want to do and what I want to do I don't do
It's me, not You
And it seems I'm not true
And it seems I’m not you
Pleased in things that are not You
Seeing things that are not true, man
Can't fight the fight because I'm too mad
The light to bright to drive you badge
My vision, so distracted by tension
Condemnation, placing faith in the weight of my sickness
Life's prescription is distant
Wait, my Physician is living
His finish was the grace for my prison
The cake for the villains
I'm raised in His image
It's the penicillin for the snake and his venom
I race and I'm tempted
I race and I'm trippin'
My behavior like I wasn't raised from the crypt
I got to face it, I'm sick
Then I get a face of me waiting for me to see Jesus
And gaze at His face until I get there

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Don't know what we go through, don't know what we go through
See the rings, see the videos, see the means
See the dreams of the queen for the good life
But I want to be a good wife
Wish I would have come home
It would have been a good night
But instead we had a fight
And the price is the piece of the wolf bite
I came home from that honeymoon
Feeling high, feeling right
Feeling like our whole life was in front of us
Until something nudged me to take the test
It said 'yes'
I'm saying 'No, this can't be right
Can't be sight
I'm trying to live
This can't be life
How am I a mother after eight days of being a wife?'
I'm being invited to imprint a life
And I can't focus on nothing else but me
Until I realize who was living in me was given to me
From His wisdom
Livin
Swimming with fins, fishing with fin
My heart's society bait, telling us "wait"
Baby's first name is "mistake"
It's a problem when the saints
Believe that we're slow dancing with sovereignty
Until we got to be taken from this life like it's robbery
We're just pottery
The joy is that the clay is shaped by grace
And the Potter promised me that everything will work for good

[Hook][Verse 1 - Jackie Hill Perry]
Wake up 6 in the morning, sun is steady shining
The blinds rising, I’m yawning, ready to get this money
Kevin heartless, Eddie hustle, my struggle nothing funny
Open this book of tricks, magician dipped in Armani
Open this book of scripts, scripture flipping I’m running
Out of time to find scriptures slick to get money
Out the pockets of bodies, pick pocketing pews
Prophet is what they call me, my pockets profit off you
I retain the stock when I exchange the truth
My aim is not to click, bang, shoot at the jewels who’s hanging round my neck, blue diamonds on my noose
A parable’s what I'll preach, tithes rise when they confused
Convicted sometimes a 9 to 5 I can't, I John 9 High 5
And rob the saints, it’s easy
I’m giving out masks today, a masquerade
They just doing what they master say, I’m passing lanes
Listening to Wu-Tang in my speaker, sipping my macchiato, gotta get my cream up
Got communion in the AM, hope they don’t whine like crushed grapes
Blood pressure raising, heard a voice say, “Aye, You remind me of Balaam.”
I heard about him before, two colors what I paint with
All I see is green like the Wiz when his mind changes
I take a puff of purpIe, I preach good when I fly with angels

[Verse 2 - Jackie Hill Perry]
As I stand before the people underneath the steeple
Kinda thinkin' twice like I’m repeating sequels
Then I think about my life, bigger than cathedrals
How it's flyer than a kite on the back of eagles
I’m good on getting low like I float with seagulls
You can’t shake me, I ain't Haiti with a case of seizures
So open up the book of God, my motives hidden like it’s living in some camouflage
Cameras are all around me, paparazzi feelin’
Papa bought to rob the children up out they chill en’s
My pupils to the ceiling, like students sitting on the roof, prayers loosed
I hope he hear it, never mind
Let's get in this text, a 100 or so characters in front of me
Tell 'em turn John 3, when the singers done like John B
My mind seems to be light like high beams
Read right into the story of God’s son, my Nas stomach feeling funny
I can’t focus, this problem I can’t show it
The tape rolling, they ready to swim and I’m Frank Ocean
I think. Conviction gripping my neck and I can’t choke
This hope is prying my eyes open, no one sees my soul is solar
The Son is coming for me, tell him wait
Entire place is quiet now, my wife’s face is a quiet frown
My mind state is acquired now, I’m prostrate
My face is down, my mind is changed
I whisper vows, he listens now, I’m wowed how
He’s everything I’ve been looking for
In the book I was flipping like a gymnast or a centerfold
For some sinner dough, now I know he knows this sinner though
So my soul was searching for a source to put his symptoms on
Now my soul is richer than it’s ever been, heaven-sent medicine
Seen it in the middle of my meddlin’
Sin was in my skin but now his riches in my melanin
Now my soul is richer than it’s ever been[Verse 1]
When I wake up new mercies meet me
Two hearses greet me
They search me with an urgency(weed), sea deep like seaweed
Bodypaint in this cursive
This worship is rehearsal
It's universal who you work trough
The churches purpose is to search you, mmm
This verse's purpose is to lurk the murkin' purpose of the joy thief
I seen it hidden
Where the joy be?
Inside the commands the plan B 'Destroy me'
The part of me
That can't enjoy Thee
The ploy be deploy peace
Two fingers like a 70's boy seen with some bell bottoms
Hell always riding with objects
They rejected better yet they forgotten the compass
That the optics only option is spotting the Abba
When adoption's got you, Gotham [?] is cropped from the topic
It's a process when no watching or rockin' his promise
Must be honest there's some blindness this time in my progress
Um then I remember

[Hook]
You make us happy when we look at you
You make us happy when we look for you
Satisfaction only happens to those
Who were glad in you
Glad in you

[Verse 2]
I tried to find joy in everything
Searched a couple mountains
Even thought I could get it from two from fifteens
That filled my lungs with something higher and inspire me like a sixteen or Sistine
It didn't work
But what did it was the finished work
Brought me back to Himself
Now I'm living in reverse
Seeing good gifts as a glimpse of the giver
Not the gifts as a giver
Merry Christmas if the vision works
If you seen him then you get it
An image no sentence can keep out of a mental prison
Our mental was limited with mention of His existence
When it was finished, that was the beginning of all joy, all the attention
If I'm happy in You
I'm happy with You
Attraction to You makes our drastic passions turn to ashes
Grab the urn and burn it faster
Then Jackie Turner satisfaction serving you
I'm just happy learning you

[Hook]Hello. My name is Mary Jane
Also known as cannabis sativa, pot, weed, and hip
I am what your parents used to place in white sheets of paper
No, not note book paper, joint paper
Yes I'm pretty popular
My body can transform into many forms so I am typically the color green
like the Grinch
I am the present hidden under the tree
I bet most of you in this room have tried to make a whore out of me
But i have simply pimped you in choosing my three leaves over the trinity
My scent is a mix of Christmas trees and overcooked over ren baker
when most people meet me they break me into pieces and discard my seeds
laying me to rest in a swisher sweet colored casket
the flick of a lighter ignites me
contring up my spirit to make it's way into yours i am nothing more
the commercialized voodoo and you are my harry pot-ters
you know I'm sort of an activist
before the marijuana tax act of 1937 i was completely legal
no handcuffs on my buds, no shackles on my stems
little do these people know how much i can do for those i need of my help
i abolish the pain of AIDS and Cancer patients while amplifying the flesh
making every sin you could ever conceive
more desirable than the apple dangling like death on the tree in the sight of Eve
why do you think everytime you take a puff of me you get greedy like the hustlers in your stomach
I cause the munchies, everybody loves the munchies
even though the munchies is just a cute word for gluttony
I am better at feeding you sin than Satan is
Hey hey hey, its also been said i can help those with Glaucoma
everybody has the right to see right?
take one hit of me and watch your eyes become x-rays undressing every person you see
helping you rape fornicate and sodomized men and women with your blinks
lust is simply a sinly side affect that comes along with me and its funny
that those who allow lust to take over their soul got stoned to death go figure
thats the reason why your eyes are the color of red rum when you are drunk off me
i am a murderer in disguise but nobody dies from weed
the leading cause of preventable death in America is tobacco not me
but your idolatry of me is killing you soft and slowly like the Fugees on repeat you
consistently seem me over the author of your breath you breathe in my Satanic love when you are thirsty for
comfort and peace when you are lonley you let me sing you lullabies with my lies when you are
hurt you cry while feasting on my pipes and bones you and your friends
can't seem to see the suicide you commit every time you do a shotgun
woah woah woah, first of all, its not that serious
second of all, if I'm legalized, i can save the government up to $10-15 billion a year
first of all its eternally serious, second of all lets do the math God is eternal
infinite meaning he has no beginning no end there is no number ascribed to him
God is holy man is not, sin is a direct slap in the face of God in which he created
in honor of him every puff puff pass is storing up a measurable wrath on the hand of the transgressor
hypothetically speaking lets say every sin costs a million dollars
i tend to produce less greed hate pride idolotry laziness sexual immorality
munchies i mean gluttony with every person i come in contact with literally that means for
every joint pipe or bone smoked you reckoning $9 million a high
if you were to smoke a blunt a day for 365 days you will end up making
$3,285,000,000 in sin a year for every year you are with me against a holy infinite and righteous God
which you are expected to meet on judgement day you cannot afford to love me
i was not made for you to replace me with the creator
I am not God but didn't God create marijuana?
all weed heads are doing are simply making use of his high in art work
so we should apply that concept to everything God created
Child molesters shouldn't be penalized because they are simply making use of children
with forced intercourse right? Until the earth is flung through the sky i will continue
to justify my lies by helping you to pervert the true purpose of my conception
the truth is i cannot help you, i cannot cure you, i cannot give you peace and joy
i cannot comfort you i am only temporary can't you see i am as fickle as a Schizophrenic therapist
i make you feel good for 15-30 minutes then i leave you with the same emotions with you as you came
so i know you will come back to me how desperate can you be
i hit you and quit you every time you smoke me
you have made me into your master and willingly became my slave
the evidence of your bond to me is in the cotton growing inside of your mouth
every time you kiss me don't you see we are not made for each other
a lot of you know me this way but not many of you know the real me
this is the real me, this is reality, i am more than mary jane
i am the ressurrected Jekyll Hyde
and there are two faces of every high
i am either extremely evil
or wonderfully good
and what is good can seem evil and what is evil is excellent at looking good
which side of me you want to believe is for you to choose
lovers of me will not suffer from lung disease but they will all suffocate on deception
this has been a PSA announcement from mary Jane
and i hope i have officially blown your high[Verse 1: JGivens]
Count sheep
Now enter a dream
Of a scepter held by an expert Shepherd
And He do the same thing
But for these sheep it seems like it's 1-2-3
Keep falling on me
Now honestly think
Would you ever depend on attention-deficit sheep
That continue to think they could peep with the Shepherd and His network
"Let him eat give him new fleece"
They want a sweatshirt
Or when they eat so they struggle to read
And every other week it's an excerpt from an internet verse
On a meme or a t-shirt or a mass text
Fast-food eating little sheep
Try and lecture
But they walk weak with a limp like a Fred Durst
Who gonna confess first?
No no doubt or don't speak
There's a lamb in silence with a Hannibal (bull)
And he should give it all to the lector
And ask the Shepherd so dare I try
I'm Jeremiah the bulimic sheep who don't eat
I just say I'm tired and go to sleep paralyzed
Like what if my legs are a pair of lies
I count real well and I stand disguised
Cat with a little bit of fear is a whole lot of pride can you feel me
Started from the bottom like Wheelchair Jimmy
Now I'm trying to get verified
Who cares? God, where was I?
Confessions to the God of Jacob changed my makeup
And give me grace when I wake up

[Hook: Natalie Lauren]
In the morning comes the simplest of pleasure
Eyes wide open to the sight of treasures
But you gotta see something better
Better
Than stuff around you
You gotta see something better
Better better
Little pretty treasures trying to drown you out

[Verse 2: Jackie Hill Perry]
I wake up and I think
Does an artist seek
The canvas or the paint
He makes the brush blush plus
He loves what he can't obtain
I guess he's drawing a blank
It's nothing
An idiom made him something
David Blaine can't change
I tricked you
You reading the surface of this puzzle
The struggle is beneath. It's deep. I'm shallow
It's like I want what I see
But I can't get past my shadow
My need competes with me
I wanna battle
The snake's awake now
My trophy's rattle
I'm done with riddles
The truth is simple
I wake up and Folgers fold me into something fickle
In other words, what's brewing is my ruin
It's simple
The music of my morning has no Word
Hear the instrumental
Of the lies of self-sufficiency
I'm living like I've been complete
Tweeting before I speak to King
Or Mordecai with better dreams
It's better things than sight
'Cuz I was made for this
If mirrors make me happier than Christ
Then I'm an atheist. It's fact or fiction

[Hook: Natalie Lauren]
In the morning comes the simplest of pleasure
Eyes wide open to the sight of treasures
But you gotta see something better
Better
Than stuff around you
You gotta see something better
Better better
Little pretty treasures trying to drown you out

[Outro: Natalie Lauren]
Don't ever leave my side
You're all I wanted, need inside
It's your love
It's you
It's your love
It's you
It's you, it's you
Never leave, never leave me
Never leave, never leave me[Verse 1 - Jackie Hill Perry]
Wake up 6 in the morning, sun is steady shining
The blinds rising, I’m yawning, ready to get this money
Kevin heartless, Eddie hustle, my struggle nothing funny
Open this book of tricks, magician dipped in Armani
Open this book of scripts, scripture flipping I’m running
Out of time to find scriptures slick to get money
Out the pockets of bodies, pick pocketing pews
Prophet is what they call me, my pockets profit off you
I retain the stock when I exchange the truth
My aim is not to click, bang, shoot at the jewels who’s hanging round my neck, blue diamonds on my noose
A parable’s what I'll preach, tithes rise when they confused
Convicted sometimes a 9 to 5 I can't, I John 9 High 5
And rob the saints, it’s easy
I’m giving out masks today, a masquerade
They just doing what they master say, I’m passing lanes
Listening to Wu-Tang in my speaker, sipping my macchiato, gotta get my cream up
Got communion in the AM, hope they don’t whine like crushed grapes
Blood pressure raising, heard a voice say, “Aye, You remind me of Balaam.”
I heard about him before, two colors what I paint with
All I see is green like the Wiz when his mind changes
I take a puff of purpIe, I preach good when I fly with angels

[Verse 2 - Jackie Hill Perry]
As I stand before the people underneath the steeple
Kinda thinkin' twice like I’m repeating sequels
Then I think about my life, bigger than cathedrals
How it's flyer than a kite on the back of eagles
I’m good on getting low like I float with seagulls
You can’t shake me, I ain't Haiti with a case of seizures
So open up the book of God, my motives hidden like it’s living in some camouflage
Cameras are all around me, paparazzi feelin’
Papa bought to rob the children up out they chill en’s
My pupils to the ceiling, like students sitting on the roof, prayers loosed
I hope he hear it, never mind
Let's get in this text, a 100 or so characters in front of me
Tell 'em turn John 3, when the singers done like John B
My mind seems to be light like high beams
Read right into the story of God’s son, my Nas stomach feeling funny
I can’t focus, this problem I can’t show it
The tape rolling, they ready to swim and I’m Frank Ocean
I think. Conviction gripping my neck and I can’t choke
This hope is prying my eyes open, no one sees my soul is solar
The Son is coming for me, tell him wait
Entire place is quiet now, my wife’s face is a quiet frown
My mind state is acquired now, I’m prostrate
My face is down, my mind is changed
I whisper vows, he listens now, I’m wowed how
He’s everything I’ve been looking for
In the book I was flipping like a gymnast or a centerfold
For some sinner dough, now I know he knows this sinner though
So my soul was searching for a source to put his symptoms on
Now my soul is richer than it’s ever been, heaven-sent medicine
Seen it in the middle of my meddlin’
Sin was in my skin but now his riches in my melanin
Now my soul is richer than it’s ever been[Hook]
God, You're making me better
You're making me better
And You choose to do it however, whenever, wherever
(x4)

[Verse 1]
You don't know what I've been through, don't know what I've been through
When the pain cuts deep, cuts deep
You would think it was jiu-jitsu
And with me as the meat on the menu
Instead of peps with the meat from the temple
Trying to find joy in the midst, this don't seem that simple
Cause I do what I don't want to do when what I don't want I do
And I do what I don't want to do and what I want to do I don't do
It's me, not You
And it seems I'm not true
And it seems I’m not you
Pleased in things that are not You
Seeing things that are not true, man
Can't fight the fight because I'm too mad
The light to bright to drive you badge
My vision, so distracted by tension
Condemnation, placing faith in the weight of my sickness
Life's prescription is distant
Wait, my Physician is living
His finish was the grace for my prison
The cake for the villains
I'm raised in His image
It's the penicillin for the snake and his venom
I race and I'm tempted
I race and I'm trippin'
My behavior like I wasn't raised from the crypt
I got to face it, I'm sick
Then I get a face of me waiting for me to see Jesus
And gaze at His face until I get there

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Don't know what we go through, don't know what we go through
See the rings, see the videos, see the means
See the dreams of the queen for the good life
But I want to be a good wife
Wish I would have come home
It would have been a good night
But instead we had a fight
And the price is the piece of the wolf bite
I came home from that honeymoon
Feeling high, feeling right
Feeling like our whole life was in front of us
Until something nudged me to take the test
It said 'yes'
I'm saying 'No, this can't be right
Can't be sight
I'm trying to live
This can't be life
How am I a mother after eight days of being a wife?'
I'm being invited to imprint a life
And I can't focus on nothing else but me
Until I realize who was living in me was given to me
From His wisdom
Livin
Swimming with fins, fishing with fin
My heart's society bait, telling us "wait"
Baby's first name is "mistake"
It's a problem when the saints
Believe that we're slow dancing with sovereignty
Until we got to be taken from this life like it's robbery
We're just pottery
The joy is that the clay is shaped by grace
And the Potter promised me that everything will work for good

[Hook][Verse 1]
First time I saw you I was with my cousin
He was buzzin'
He had a baby mother that didn't trust him
I was seven, he was 20-something with two kids
While we was at the store, she popped up with a pistol and a fist
I looked her in the eyes, seen the schizo and the fear
With a mama out her mind screaming "I'mma come for mine"
So I ran to the back with his two kids, we both cryin'
Tryna figure out if my cousin dead or alive
Am I the last one to see his eyes?
Am I the last one to see his time pass with the blast
Of a mother troubled by my sad situation
I waited for somebody to rescue me
The song I see on TV is The Refugees
Playing in my head while I dread watching my cousin get locked like Haile Selassie
Praise Yahweh, he wasn't dead, Lauryn
I ain't know your name back then but your lyrics
Kept me kinda sane back when
I was in the back thinking "Let the track spin"
Let the track spin, sing it

[Hook]
Ooh la la la
Ooh la la la
That's the way that we rock when we doing our thing

[Verse 2]
Saturday morning I see you on the TV singing in the split screen
50's theme with a picture
It's a sister with a crown that isn't made of gold
But skin like mine, that's when my mind froze like the summer's gone
That color wasn't popular, changed me in the winter
Maybe that will make me lighten up or bright enough or white enough to heighten love
"Zion" was the track I played out
Educating misses on the mission Adam made out
[Be a mother or an artist and make your case sound inside the playground
With toys don't take the place of your present
They gift the stay round]?
Ms. Marigold, you killed the Grammy's, rest in peace to them
Very ghosts that repeated the parable that chicks don't put bullets in pencils
Even in writtens let the lead go
The trigger spittin' wicked, it's wicker, it's brooms flyin', no witches
The lyrics only scarecrows, you made 'em timid, Lauryn
Yeah, I knew your name back then and your lyrics
Really brought some change back when
I was in the back thinking "Let the track spin"
Let the track spin, sing it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Ms. Lauryn, it was a minute before we saw your face
You made "Miseducation" then left the class with another teacher to take your place
Fans waiting patiently, pacing the record places for music that they could play without you
We just Drakes, nothing was the same until "Unplugged" showed up
Voice broken but the substance told the story that a drug imitates
It was hot, doper than the vanity in the veins
In entertainment's attics, you radically ravished the masses
With a couple words or two
With action in your language, something verbs would do
But your emotion had me asking if you was alright
You seemed kind of different like in the distance you might've dealt with some issues
Some religion that had Scriptures but with no intentions of giving you Christ
Giving you life, I could be trippin' but I'm telling the truth
If a decision's what you made, lyrics can't be the proof
It's something else, it's something bigger than you
It's Jesus, when you was climbing out your box, I hope you seen Him
Peace will find you when you seek Him
In the meantime, I'm praying for you
You're a legend, hope to see you in Heaven, Lauryn

You ain't been the same since back then, I know
You kinda changed back when
I was in the back thinking "Let the track spin"
Let the track spin, sing it

[Hook][Hook: Swoope]
What I'm finna quit for?
You see me living like a king
It's still 1-1-6 bruh
Oh Lord! working for the same team
I think I need a ad-lib from Diddy!
Cause Imma take that to each and every city
Homie, Imma take that, take that(X5)
I think I need a ad-lib from Diddy!
Cause Imma take that to each and every city, homie Imma

[Verse 1: Swoope]
Lecrae sell a million records
And my name don't get mentioned in the review
It don't matter, get the W
Cause even players on the bench get rings too (get rings)
Way deep is what the crew is
On the same team, all running the same play
So you need to check your motives if you're doing this
If you was mad Andy sold 28k ah!
Taking away from the mission
All this division don't add up
It all equals dissension
Ya' ask me that's bad math bruh
So yeah, I'm on Collision, but really I am indifferent
If you 116 and independent
No, you King livin', junkie dream itchin'
Humble coffee bean sippin'
Long as the mission and the team don't seem different

[Verse 2: Jackie Hill]
Humble Beast is a piece of a piece
Like a finger missing little little Richard
With the scream but it's singing kinda simple with the keys
Kinda tripping playin' notes
Trying to listen can you hear it?
Oh you don't, cause your ear's with your feet
Kinda different when the body ain't complete, huh?
What's the difference if the body don't compete huh?
That's a team picture
IG it when you see us

[Verse 3: Taelor Gray]
I just follow my marching orders
Beg your pardon?
Tell me how I went from dead to pardoned
Don't tell me how to testify
I'm a wretch with an extra life
That's how I continue
Word to JGivens Bienvenue
I'm killin' everything on the menu
That's same team
Grab a utensil, we eat!

[Hook: KB]
What I'm finna quit for?
You see me living like a king
It's still 1-1-6 though
Oh Lord! Welcome to the same team
I think I need a adlib from Diddy!
Cause Imma take that to each and every city
Homie, Imma take that, take that(X4) (Aaahh!)
I think I need a ad-lib from Diddy!
Cause Imma take that to each and every city, homie Imma

[Hook]

[Verse 4: JGivens]
Humble as a mumble in the jungle of shouts and screams
Digging tunnels under a stampede, beast!
Okay-kay keep, praying for the grace we stay cold but never freeze
Like water at four-four blap-blap degrees
Uhhh, fahrenheit, where was I, dare if I share a terabyte
We don’t care if you verified
Your lil' brand is just a fraction
In the middle of a grain of sand
Or the hand of a master crafter of sand castles
With the passion, imagine, decapitating dragons
We are just a vapor on paper on another vapor of a microcosm of a remnant of minions
Running like Kenyans like Obama
Irrepentance to the Father
Better warn the town the beast is loose
And you on the same team
If the dreams from the same king
If it floats from the same stream
If it don’t then it's gangrene (chop)

[Verse 5: Alex Faith]
I think I kinda feel it, no competition
Smelling like team spirit, Nirvana
No Cobain, we blow brains when they ain't wanna hear it
Same team we cliqued up now
40 deep won't switch up, ha!
I stay two to the left and one to the right
Got the kings ridin' with me when we take it to the mic
Comin' from the bottom of the map and they're know we're comin'
Unashamed shawty cause I ain't afraid to show it
If it's southern California or it's dirty dirty Dallas
Keep it slappin' in the Bay dog you know we gotta shout it
Gotta switch it up like gang sign speak
We take it all over every place I be
We bring it to the church
But don't hate on me
Cause every now and then you gotta show ID
I beast!

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Asaiah Ziv]
Oh look who they let out the cage
They ain't wanna hear it from a kid underage
Said he tryna get plates
Give the boy a little grace
I'm tryna be the light-skinned Puerto Rican MLK
With a little bit a Dilla and a little bit of Lupe
From the Cooday straight  from a runaway slave
Now I'm free with a fee that's already been paid
Give the boy a little grace
1-1-6 give 'em 16, ate 16
Had a dream now I'm 18
Give 'em 8 bars
66, we a problem
Get a solved for your number gain
Working for the same team
Why we tryna floss when we all got the same gleam
They say the sheep's gettin' lost
A mirage for the cause cause the sound's getting mainstream, uh!

[Hook][Verse 1]
When I wake up new mercies meet me
Two hearses greet me
They search me with an urgency(weed), sea deep like seaweed
Bodypaint in this cursive
This worship is rehearsal
It's universal who you work trough
The churches purpose is to search you, mmm
This verse's purpose is to lurk the murkin' purpose of the joy thief
I seen it hidden
Where the joy be?
Inside the commands the plan B 'Destroy me'
The part of me
That can't enjoy Thee
The ploy be deploy peace
Two fingers like a 70's boy seen with some bell bottoms
Hell always riding with objects
They rejected better yet they forgotten the compass
That the optics only option is spotting the Abba
When adoption's got you, Gotham [?] is cropped from the topic
It's a process when no watching or rockin' his promise
Must be honest there's some blindness this time in my progress
Um then I remember

[Hook]
You make us happy when we look at you
You make us happy when we look for you
Satisfaction only happens to those
Who were glad in you
Glad in you

[Verse 2]
I tried to find joy in everything
Searched a couple mountains
Even thought I could get it from two from fifteens
That filled my lungs with something higher and inspire me like a sixteen or Sistine
It didn't work
But what did it was the finished work
Brought me back to Himself
Now I'm living in reverse
Seeing good gifts as a glimpse of the giver
Not the gifts as a giver
Merry Christmas if the vision works
If you seen him then you get it
An image no sentence can keep out of a mental prison
Our mental was limited with mention of His existence
When it was finished, that was the beginning of all joy, all the attention
If I'm happy in You
I'm happy with You
Attraction to You makes our drastic passions turn to ashes
Grab the urn and burn it faster
Then Jackie Turner satisfaction serving you
I'm just happy learning you

[Hook][Verse 1: Jackie Hill Perry]
How you feel about seeing babies on the street with the heat
Who eats when it's beef and it's cold out
North Poles, no clothes when it goes down in the city
Inner city ain't a bit a pretty
Coppers missin' robbers just to get a penny
Justice system sicker than the intervention given to individuals with limited images
With intimate visuals of the Most High
Most die in this jungle, watch the crows fly
I grow tired in the summer when the bones rise
The chrome cried in his stomach when his soul died
How many murders in a hour? Prolly 4-5
Only time they got power when they hold 9s
It only took 3 days for the one to rise
I know they tired of walking crooked cause they lookin' blind
They want power they will find it when they put it down
It's up in heaven name 'em 7 in a daze cause they weaker than they realize
Tell 'em life ain't ours don't waste time
Tryna find life in everything that's finna die
Don't let 'em lie to 'em
Give 'em evidence of heaven when you ride through 'em
We gotta tell 'em it's something better in heaven
Embedded in everything ever seen ever been evident excellent
And it's God

[Hook: Eshon Burgundy]
I overcame that novacane
I was numb to the shots from that gun
I was livin' so insane, oh I'm so ashamed
But I'm done livin' life on the run forever
The moment you realize that this is realer than it seems
Wish you could open your eyes and realize it's all a dream
I wanna wake up, I wanna wake up
From this nightmare, I wanna wake up
But I'm right here when I wake up, when I wake up

[Verse 2: Eshon Burgundy]
In the city of death
Looking for the tree of life in a pair of 23 Nike's
Blessed that I'm looking for it in the first place
Could be a different scenario, the worst case
Take an aerial shot of my block, see the Glock of an officer pop a kid
That's how it is in the ghetto metropolis
Way before the introduction of stop and frisk, it was killer
Hopeless, a dream deferred
Fiend drop a dope dish and a needle by the curb
Heroin is a heroine, a deliverer, a savior, a medicine for some
Cold night, cold pipe full of hot fire
Prayin' to the dope god they don't even know God
How many killings in a night Jackie 4-5?
I took 3 shots that was back in 95'
Nowadays they'll kill for a G-Shock
Trigga, click, boom-bang, soundin' like a beat-box
Thank God for God though
Take a hoodlum and turn him to an apostle
Turn a simple brush stroke into a Picasso
Turn the death of His only Son into the Gospel, that's deep!
That should let you know that true love is not cheap
I oppose what false prophets preach in the street

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jackie Hill Perry]
I hear the blood of Abel screamin' from the streets
When it speaks we don't hear it but we fear it from his own mouth
Bullets rippin' through a whip just for listenin' to hits
The heart with tints was darker than the car parked with kids
I wonder if the heart was skin
Bullets looking for darkest sin
Who's the target then? It's all of us
We Paul bearers, we all lovers
We all jealous when Paul tell us we all zealous for death, Russian roulette
Click click who's next, is it you?
Did a witch put a hex on the youth?
Kaleidoscope triggers seeing colors when they shoot
Put the text in they chest, red letters in they roof, look up
Sign language to the deaf
And it's proof that the hands take command when dark ain't rebuked
Feet of the beast in the belly of the streets tryna eat
But the Priest shed His blood for the food

[Hook]

[Verse 4: The Problem - Jackie Hill Perry]
Look up in the sky, I spy a timeline of blind vultures
Blind rhymes style the fabric of the timed culture
Soaked in Satan's lies, find another kinda lotion
Cloaked in a disguise, signed the dotted line, it's over
I told 'em find another ride cause this roller coaster’s stolen
Goin' to a fate you won't believe, hocus pocus
Throwin' dreams in the face of Zzz 'till he woken
Growin' MCs that sow the seeds of heaven's roses
Rosen, risen, He did it, death is slaughtered
Our daughters barterin' souls for attention
Oughta be heard if the only audible row would listen, itchin' for words
Lotta research goin' towards a hole and they dig it
Gotta be words flowin' for heavens sake of the mission
Owin' nobody nothin', them bluffin' bustas are finished
This pen ain't pension the mentions what sinners don't wanna deal with
Filled with the vision of slaves, lynch 'em for tinted pigment
See that bus? Get in the back and act like its proven
That academics do actually lack in the black communion
Schools are lackin' the facts, lackin' the staff, they foolish
They plastic wrappin' the masses
The masters grabbin' they nooses
Bastard habits from lackin' the happy daddy influence
They ratta-ta -tat-tat, and they clap at the back of children
They action backwards, they blacker than the backward task of Judas
Laughter is the reaction when I ask if they master Jewish
Laughter is the reaction, ask if they master Jewish
Go backwards a little faster past the actions of Judas
Go forward a little more and last 'till the masters through
And they graspin' the massive truth that surpasses the attitude
That Adam's passive pursuit when he was passed the actual fruit
It ain't over 'till the fat lady sings, go grab a flute
Sax playing the soundtrack of demons singing the blues
Holiday with molly the same as cane with a different hue
A dope-a-rope generation, an Ali kinda rebuke
The violent is silent, the pilot tried to remind you you
Only one thing is true, honey what you gon' do?
Money is at the root when they come lookin' for youI was once asked, “If you could take a look into the life and mind of one person from the past, who would it be?”

Instantly my brain cracked open its spine and pages of referential people run through my head like Harriet Tubman, Martin Luther King, even a John Calvin, Jeffrey Dahmer, Augustine but strangely my thoughts became obsessed with the idea of being invited into the heart of someone we all know as Judas



A man beckoned by the son of God to follow him. Follow Him like twitter was reality. Paralyze his eyes on a hill of a God who had place himself on the inside of a woman that He intricately created Himself eternities before birth even existed. Judas walked with Jesus

I picture him Jewish. Cold coloured hair, dark brown eyes, twinkling with a seed heart beating with wonder towards this Christ whose features where just like his. Could this man really be God is what I’m sure is what plagued his dark mind as he watched Him

He watched Mary’s 30 year old-something son shovel the remains of rocks and death into his hands called dirt and bring forth spit from the same mouth that lit every star in the galaxy. He mixes them both, painted them into the pupil of man whose eyes were only acquainted with the canvas of black, blind from birth. God was the first thing that man ever saw

His last name Iscariot, first name Judas stood front row and center to a concert of God’s glory. I wonder if he saw himself in the scenario beforehand. Maybe not but he continued to watch as Christ walked towards of the cave of a man who had been dead for almost a week with a heart that had not beat for four whole days. Ears that would only work at the sound of something greater than death, “Lazarus! Come out!” Jesus yelled with the authority of the Alpha and Omega branded to his breath. A fraternity of power coming forth, for the same voice that spoke everything into existence with nothing that existed – just Him. Judas saw a corpse come to life. A dead heart beat to the soundtrack of a resurrection. A metaphor of why Jesus came, right in front of his eyes, and I could watch him think, and I don’t think he saw it yet and yet he watched as a year’s salary of oil was worshipped unto the Son of Man’s feet. Mary used her hair like a wash rug to wipe the foot of her Lord and I wonder if Judas was just confused. Confused at why this woman would give up so much just for Jesus? Could it be that her reverence was a sign that she might have seen this Nazarene called Christ for what he was worth? Possibly! But he kept watching. He watched as the guards grabbed the man he’d identified with a kiss to prepare him for a death that the world deserved unaware of the resurrection that only the elect would share in. If I could, I would assume that he looked into his palms – followed his fingerprints into the 30 pieces of silver lay dead in his hands with joy tapping dancing in the cemetery of his own ghost of destruction rising up in his bones. Those dark brown eyes staring at the receipt for what He just gave up and I bet he didn’t even see the reality of what he thought God was worth. Nothing you see!

Betrayal is easy when you kiss God goodbye in a heart that is only loyal to itself. It was Jesus who was being led away to the cup of God’s wrath, Judas coiled his head inside of a noose and the truth is, though he was sad, his conscience made him conscious of the fact that he had betrayed an innocent man but the blindness in his mind and drive, the navigation in his eyes to find that same man who was able to forgive him of all his sins so he made suicide his saviour as I watched a rope hang his throat, I just wished I could let him borrow my eyes so he could finally see. See, he, was the blind man that needed the hands of Jesus to rupture the scales from his brown eyes like brail plates danced from Gods fingertips. Let him rent my mind so he could have understand that he was a Lazarus by nature – dead, a corpse with breath, sleeping in a cave of sin, desperate for life. He walked with the one person who save him from the pitch black night right underneath his eyelids for three whole years but try, try asking a blind man to lift his eyes towards the sky and tell you the colour of the sun. He can’t see. He will never understand his need for light so darkness will be all that he knows

As I watched the body of Judas lay dangling dead from the tree, reminiscing of the piece of food that birth his inherent blindness in his genes, I actually saw myself hanging

“In their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of unbelievers, to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.” 2 Corinthians 4:4

“For God, who said, ‘Let light shine out of darkness,’ has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.” 2 Corinthians 4:6Some people make me sad
They walk past me
With the rattle of buried bodies in their skeletons
And I am interested in why they haven't dropped them off yet
How they have gotten so comfortable
With the weight of death on their backs
And I wonder
If they have seen stars in their eyes
And moons beneath their smirk
But you can tell
That a mirror would only give them nightmares
And I wish I could wake them up
Untuck them from the comfort of lonely
And remind them that some dreams do come true
That a heart with chameleon like pain
Won't always be that color
Even though the past and present hunts them like a vidual eternity
Scaring the peace out of their faith
I place my two fingers next to their weary hands
And pinky promise them
That worship isn't too far from their reaches
Long as they are willing to try
Willing to crawl
A dying hope to the edge of the Throne of Mercy
Drag their weak hearts
Into the castle skies of David's God
And beg for Him to reign there when no umbrella
Just heaven disrupting the hell and prison beneath their ribcage
Filling your lungs with songs that have been too scared to fly
It is okay
Your earthly tears will be a means for praise
The day that you see your King's face
And He wipes them away
So smile
Because peace is coming
