[Intro: A$AP Nast]
Hoes, I got hella hoes
I got hoes, I got hella hoes
I got hoes, and I'm selling dope
And I just bought that chopper and that pistol with the scope

[Hook: A$AP Nast]
Hoes, I got hella hoes
I got hoes, I got hella hoes
I got hoes, and I'm selling dope
And I just bought a chopper, let that pussy nigga know I got

[Verse 1: A$AP Twelvyy]
I got a start in these streets, extra hard for these hoes
We move hard in these streets, young God, X'ing them O's
I'm like God in these streets, got a tech in my coat
I go hard in these streets, Johnny Depp with the blow
I flip nickels and O's, I flip powder in bass
I done shoveled the snow, I done showered the state
See them flowers gone grow and the power gon' raise
And we came through the door, here we got us a race

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
All these diamonds in my teeth
I'm gone off a gallon of Hennessy
Better let your bitch go cause she's feeling me
And besides she a ho, she fucked him and me
And I gave her the beast like I'm Timothy
Moonwalk in that pussy like Billie Jean
And I open your chest like you Janet Jackson
And I blam-blam like you Timberlake
I put him in a lake and I penetrate
Let it sit in your face like a dinner date
Then bust open your grill, let it ventilate
And my niggas is killers, what can I say?
With a crew of gorillas like 50 Cent
And they peelin' bananas, no dinner plate
And I'm only gone ride with my syndicate
A$AP 'til I die, nigga, period

[Hook] x2

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
Uh, pretty mothafucka, pull up in this bitch like
Uh, jiggy mothafucka, hella hoes on my dick like
Uh, really with the shit, if a nigga trip, loading up the clip
Never slip, tight, never sleep, finna let it rip in this bitch like
Pistols poppin', pussies droppin'
Niggas coppin', bottles poppin'
Roxies choppin', Oxycontin, word to A$AP Lotto
Live down Collins mobbin' slow
Syrup got me throwed, mouth is full of gold
If I overdose, just let 'em know
Alright, I got hella hoes

[Hook] x2[Sample]
One, two, umm
Buckle my, umm

[Verse 1: Rocky]
Pass the mothafuckin' Swisher, pour some mothafuckin' liquor
For my mothafuckin' niggas who ain't wit us, keep it trilla
My gold teeth, my french braids, getting throwed since 10th grade
Wealth is in the mind, not the pocket, if that's the case, then I been paid
Herringbone chain, my gold frames, my Cartiers, you small change
You bitch made, I'm old school like gemstars and switchblades
I spit game, I get paid, a pimp game
I be, I be that pretty muthafucka, A$AP is just my nickname
(I'm comin' down when I'm tippin' on them 4's
Cause we shittin' on these, shittin' on these niggas and these hoes)
Cause that purp shit I sip up, your bitch chose, you slipped up
I get-get my dick licked, I'm draped out, drip-dripped up
Top of the top of the line, all on my grind, purple be easin' my mind
We runnin', runnin', we gunnin', gunnin', we're gonna hit one at a time, time
Them bad bitches blow kisses by my earlobe, a weirdo but I'm real though

[Verse 2: Twelvyy]
All these boppers wanna bop 'em, niggas wanna jock 'em
Not a red light or a city cop that can stop 'em
Going broke is not an option, always on that cash flow
She used to call me asshole, now she drop that ass low
Fuck it man I'm past dope, sour diesel slash coke
A$AP we the last hope, fuck it this my fast flow
I slow it down I pick it up, blue jeans I rip 'em up
That's swag bitch, you mad bitch, see you in my past bitch
I'm headed to the future, Twelvyy ain't no loser
Mixing up that syrup, call it Punky Brewster
I'm slurring wussup, don't tell me to shut up
I ain't tryna start shit, but man I'm really fucked up
I lucked up, I see it as a come up
I'm on my job man, I see you when the sun's up
Huh, young niggas run everything
A$AP to the top and these bitches love everything

[Verse 3: Nast]
God bless America, my flow is scarier
Style wild like my nigga Common after Erykah
Your bitch, I'm in bed with her, head so good
Make a nigga feel good to the point I wanna marry her
But I be on my pimping shit, check out my limp and shit
I be getting money, getting money, can you dig it, bitch?
Hoes get on my pimping ship all aboard, all aboard
East coast mothafuckas making all the noise, all the noise
I know you niggas heard of us, Raf Simon murderers
Fashion killa word to Bigga Bars, I never heard of ya
Still sipping candy painted whips is what I'm sitting in
Kitchen chemist whipping up that shit that get these bitches in
New York Nasty flow, that's a little bit of crack mixed in with a fifth of Hen
Business man, middle finger to your fucking business, man
Great adventure shit, rollercoasting take a flick of this
Motion picture shit, bitch I grind like a skater do
Always $trive and Prosper rock what level we gon' take it to?[Verse 1: SpaceGhostPurrp]
Back in this bitch mothafucka, yeah it's me
SpaceGhostPurrp and I put your bitch to sleep
Me and my twin at it again with this phonk
Sipping on gin, living in sin, lean in the trunk
RIP to Screw, rest in peace to Pimp C
Shout out to the H and that fucking SUC
My fucking brain is purple, nigga

[Hook]
Everything is purple (Swag)

[Verse 2: ASAP Rocky]
It be that pretty mothafucka sipping that throwed
Gripping my pistol, my chrome
Hidden to hit you then splitting your wig into something
I spit it and flip it like Bone
Niggas ain't ready for the flow switch
Only Harlem nigga on his Bone shit
Tippin 4's since back in 06
Won't you see a nigga getting throwed bitch
Two middle fingers to the show, bitch
Cause they selfish in the show biz
Cause they shelf kids and it's hopeless
Career dying quicker than a goldfish
I be the fly young fella, Maison Martin Margiela
Bitches Cinderellas under my umbrella, I go and tell her

[Hook]

[Verse 3: ASAP Nast]
All hell here, bitch it's Satan talking
Told her to take it off, give her the D, she take the offense
Skinny nigga balling, trip but never falling
Who said to make it rain? Bitch I make it pouring
I'm a cake-o-saurus go study my nature
Big chain on me like Treach from Naughty by Nature
Fuck what you saying, no way, a hater don't faze a gangster
Brought up in danger, all about paper, smoking on purple
Bitch, I'm Dangerous Nasty Crazy 90's Baby, momma I made it
Up to the sky, goodbye to the pavement, hoes get caught in amazement
I'm stuck in my ways, so fuck 'em up, I fuck 'em and duck 'em for days
What more can I say? I'm chasing this paper, that's purple, nigga[Produced by A$AP Ty Beats]

[Intro]
Yo, yo-yo, yo
90's era Nasty, yeah
Yo, Ty Beats!

[Verse 1: A$AP Nast]
I need some time alone
Cold, my rhymes will turn your mind to stone
That's the work of satan niggas be hating but I'm a pot of gold
This ain't just me rappin' it's real and something you gots to know
Catch a mark nigga hatin', get him a casket, that bastard's 'bout to go
Whoa, Nasty baby I'm crazy, the 90's raised me
I'm just as smart, probably smarter than half the cats who play me
Brazy, driving miss daisy, hit on my strap
In my zone, mind on my money like where that shit at?
I'm all alone, that's my only hope
And be damned if I'mma chase that with some phony homes, on the real
It be the ones that say, "We got this, that you ain't alone"
As long as I'm here to pull out the Glock 9 and cocked it
He mad you got rich but on the low you should've watched him
Cats connivin', head first into the livest object
"That was your man, now you 'bout to die quick"
Over some fly shit, you feel reminded of your fast-life ventures
And winters, blinded 'til the flashlight enters

[Hook: A$AP Nast]
I got a funky-funky style with a funky swag (x2)
I bought the funky-funky Nikes got the hat to match (x2)
I got a funky-funky style with a funky swag (x2)
And when I kill 'em with the flow, ain't no comin' back (x2)

[Verse 2: Method Man]
I got a poor man's panache, I be stretching the cash
I'm a little passive aggressive, you get a stretcher when I'm mad
Borderline manic depressive, rappers stressin' me bad
Got too many less than impressive rappers left in my path
Better yet, we gon' leave 'em left in the past
Someone slides, this time I ride, you get left in the back
Who am I? I'm a titan so be expectin' a clash
Start to wavin' arms at you, you'd think I'm catchin' a cab
No questions, live the answers cause if you're lookin' to ask
Look at Meth, breakin' bad like he cookin' meth in the lab
Still a lethal weapon but try and bless him with math
Rappers never learn their lesson so I ain't lettin' 'em pass
I ain't lettin' 'em brag, I ain't lettin' 'em swag
Fuck swag, just being blunt, while I'm pluckin' my ash
Y'all ain't up in my class in the buildin'
It's A$AP Meth, quick to kill 'em, that's an ASAP death

[Hook: A$AP Nast]

[Verse 3: A$AP Nast]
Straight out the back, dog, I'm Shaq strong, I'm breakin' backboards
Draped in Tommy, my bitch beside me, young god body
I play the back of clubs, clicks are foul, youngins are rowdy
Fools get rowdy, ain't nothin' dumb, my guns from Saudi
High off the Maui, don't trip your weed, rolling the finest
You know the fronto, Sucio Guapo, I'm head honcho
I sport the poncho, connects with Sandro, the illest y'all know
Killin' 'em pronto, my funky fresh is filthy, designer
But check my rhymes though, my verse is like atomic bombs, yo
Haters like side hoes, I peel off in the illest Tahoe
Watch out for potholes, H leaning, that's why he drive slow
Nast Diablo, the 90's era shit in effect
Clowns be watching, best protect ya necks

[Hook: A$AP Nast][Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
A$AP! Guess who just came up?
From the land of milk and honey, where the thing bust
Spray the Mac-11 'til a nigga sprang up
And it's snakes in the grass but the bitch ain't cut
That lean and that Tussin be up in my cup
Slanging that drugs, there's no stretching no cut
Four gold chains, same color was the slugs
And a chain with a plate saying, "Don't give a fuck"

[Verse 2: A$AP Twelvyy]
I be on that block, be on that stoop
Tryna get cash for the coop
Get cash for the coop, got Da$h in the loop
Might spaz on your troop, cause that's what I do
More fashionable with a bad bitch or two
All of my tools, all of my jewels
Man, I'm awfully cool, all of these dudes
Watching all of our moves, I'm offing these fools

[Verse 3: Da$h]
Henny in my cup, half a blunt in my jaws
Said fuck court, now I'm running from the law
Paid the attorney, I give a fuck about the charge
Think the ho's Matlock, way to get a nigga off
Feeling like Kurt Cobain, black bitch love cocaine
Learn my tricks from the dope game
Young and high die tryna get rich
R. Kelly really think that I can fly in this bitch?

[Verse 4: A$AP Ant]
Blow in her nose got crack on the stove
House full of girls, who know my flow
Real-ass nigga keep the burner in my draws
Pussy-ass niggas get the full clip y'all
Rich-ass nigga house got eight dogs
Two times four broads, that's eight broads
Fly young nigga with the Black Scale on
She loving my music, she singing my songs

[Verse 5: A$AP Ferg]
Bang 'em, get Halle Berry when I spray 'em
Dump 'em in the garbage, I would "Losing Issiah" 'em
Ah, damn, Young Fergy turn into a satan
Got you laying dead, mothafucka, better say your prayers
AK 'em, brrrr in that dirt you be laying
Mama gon' be crying, won't you hear that preacher singing
He be singing like, "Welcome to the crossroads"
Bang 'em, pull the trigger, middle finger when you hear them shots spraying

[Verse 6: A$AP Nast]
Just bought new shoes, that's Prada
New crib out in Cali smoking maui
With my niggas, like I oughta, A$AP 'member that
Now my niggas 'bout to blow, like propane
Yeah, I talk about Raf like I talk about rap
But it's only cause I'm flossing, take it up another notch
See they like our sound, it's so amazing
They say it costs to be the boss
We done earned our spot, y'all niggas tryna take it
Jock a little bit of steez from the set
But it's cool, probably thought I wouldn't say shit
It's a recession in the hood, I ain't going back home
Every dollar, I'mma make it
Won't stop 'til we ball like the Lakers, bitch[Verse 1: A$AP ROCKY]
Look, I’m out for presidents that represent me
Benz and Bentley, head from Lindsey
Like Lohan,  nigga evidently
The hoes in every city, hella swift
Once had a bad yellow bitch
Let her strip, life ain’t been the same ever since
The oddball in a room full of elephants
My elegance take me to them other elements
With jew and jewels, a chain full of evidence
My jewelry is my jury and my face got embezzlement
Motherfuckin’ syndicate, delicate, intelligence
Connected out to the Netherlands
My music goes out and moves predicates
So mommy, tell a friends and tell a friend
Run and tell a friend and tell a friend
Email me to tell a friend
That crack I got will sell gain
Swear this purple lean is like my medicine
Could probably roll some weed and we the best of friends
Probably go to places that I never been
I heard that voice up in my head again, represent

[Verse 2: A$AP NAST]
Yo, ayo, I’m passing focus
I’m in my zone, fuck who haven’t noticed
Hoes ain’t like me, said I’m ugly, now they actin’ open
Pussy soakin’ I pimp that ho like my name Goldie
The name’s Nast, yeah, your freak know me
I beat the box, leave that thing swollen
Peace to my city with my hammer loaded
Pigs annoying like the sound of locusts
I style wild plus my rhymes the dopest
My squad’s the best, a bunch of lyrical soldiers
Rock a fella, Hova’s culture
We drink Henny like soda reject chicks like “hold up”
And know the game like we supposed to
Our lives are like the rollercoaster
The up’s and down’s keep my fam closer
No sneak attacks, these niggas can’t approach us
Damn jokers, we stack chips to keep the heat from vultures
That any day could try to run up on us, Mob life

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
Mob Life, A$AP Mob life I fuck a mob wife
I did it twice yeah I’m trife I don’t give a fuck
I kill a nigga do life do life twice you
Do 2pac like I roll dice
Put your life on the line, bet it nigga I dead it
Who said it they don’t want it with niggas who set the game
Fuck that I don’t even need a chain
I get bitches off the game, or the swagger
In the lyrics you couldn't hear it my shit exquisite
I’m in the… (ugh)
When I flow it, I keep it going, he got the pink bucket
Like fuck it I gotta tell her suck it
She ain’t never do it her man coming, and now she ducking
Now I’m in the truckin’ and we in the beamer, couldn’t see him
When he coming through gleamin’ because I got this bitch named Tima
And she gave me her number last summer frontin on a nigga
Now I got a number one song she running to a nigga, fuck that

[Verse 4: A$AP FERG]
Oh, you talkin’ about Tima, riding in the beamer? (yeah)
And the sneakers was looking cleaner now they all on lean up
Now I’m tipping lean up now I’m on the clean-up
‘Cause I’m cleaning all these rappers, niggas know I’m in this
Going to the cleaners with the Beamer ‘cause I got that new Versace shit
Now my shit is cleaner and I’m chilling with Flex
And your bitch give me sex, and she give me the next
When I’m grabbing her text, ‘Cause I got the tech with the vest
And you shooting at your neck, nigga you about to get it next

[Verse 5: A$AP ROCKY]
I'm so bomb, Flex drop one
Fuck that, hella hoes, Flex we got one
Yo, I might be like Tupac’s son

Fuck that I come through with that exclusive new shit

I keep chapstick my flow make you do back flips
I act sick, you act sick? I pack six
Gins, triggers, niggas, couldn’t fuck with us
Tommy Hilfiger, we brought it back, all of that
Starter caps and we got the naughty shorties
They love it, coming in the club with forties
Like, we couldn’t afford these
Motherfuckin’ wine and champagne bottles
Is you out your fuckin’ mind?
I could save a dime, a hundred times
If I pop it like I’m fuckin’ balling
But I ain’t, I’m shot calling
Who coming home?

[Verse 6: A$AP FERG]
Yo, yo, when you getting slow bucks they come at your name
And I come off flipping like Flex and Dame
Niggas don’t know I stay flexin’ on ya dame
And that bitch gave me the ass, she gave me the brain

[Verse 7: A$AP ROCKY & A$AP FERG]
Until 50 cent run up and take your chain
He ain’t gonna do that to me ‘cause I got that thing
Oh shit, I heard he with the G-Unit gang
Ay, but we with that A$AP MOB

[Verse 8: A$AP ROCKY]
Shout outs to Slow Buds
That’s my nigga, he know its love
I give no fucks
I know this bitch named Simmy she gives me floor fucks
You know I gave about four bucks
‘Cause she a known ho, but you know, keep that on the low though
I walk down yellow brick like Toto
I got a four do’, ruby slippers, I got my bitch with her
She got a bitch Suzie with her
And you know I did it in the Jacuzzi
And you remember them bitch from back in the day
With the finger waves?

[Verse 9: A$AP FERG]
You talking about Suzie, in the Jacuzzi?
Wearing Gucci? She got the fat coochie
With the big ass booty? (uh huh) I remember that shorty
She was drinking a forty and she was acting naughty
Yeah, I like to get up in the red though
And she liked my clothes and she liked my earlobes

[Verse 10: A$AP ROCKY]
Yeah though, but you know, she likes to fuck with the weirdos
We don’t do those, I’m a werewolf, we don’t wear those
I like the bitches, the birds, I flock ‘em, I’m a scarecrow
Flacko be the name, yeah ho, fuck that shit it’s my year though
Nast what you said, remember the bitch that would give…

[Verse 11: A$AP NAST]
We shot but we don’t ever hear though
I’m here but I’m not like air though
I put the shot to your earlobe
Yo Nasty style, nasty baby, and I’m wild
Who that? That’s the kid, go ask about him
Hold up, niggas throw...from the bottom
Fuck that...

[Verse 12: A$AP ROCKY]
I got one question, while you flowing
Flex been doing this for years so he knowing
We got it open and you know this shit clean
Ayo, Flex you a vet, can I get a sixteen?
What’s popping man? Let me hear something
Drop a bomb for the town nigga
(I don’t even have a ten or a twelve)

[Verse 13: A$AP NAST]
I’m out for presidents who represent me
I’m hardcore buzzing, ain’t got time for stunting
Ain’t got time for nothing, I’m that new era quit your speculation boy
That’s nasty baby, now he crazy, like , who fucking with the boy?
Super lowed out, I had my team, my sneaks, my jeans and all that
Perform in all black, your bitch is wet like where her draws at?
I’ve had in all that, I’ve fucked her once and never call back
Can’t trust these dusty bitches on my ballsack
Fuck with the door cracked, you clowns can  hate or get your skull cracked
When I be wasted, taking blunts of Cali’s finest took each to the face
I know complacent G’s, warm-hearted the rapper-type, that act alike
No we don’t rap alike, the flow courageous, son of Satan, we up

[Verse 14: A$AP ANT]
YG Addie back on that bullshit
Like Carl Ripken when the ball hit
Y’all broke niggas giving out no tips
Y’all order one bottle, y’all share sips
You got no hoes nigga you ain’t no pimp
I about to touch the sky see my name on a blimp
Bought Coke white air-1’s looking like a mint
Lint on your pocket looking real famished
Get a little buzz then y’all vanish
I’m over the pot, I’m doing magic
I rush like a brick, real tannish
I speak into the plug in Spanish
I got a dope strip, out in Kansas
I ride on a horse like a bandit
Send me back in school like a fucking campus
Free crack, free crack I whip in the wrist
I got a red-nosed chick  just like a pit
(Chanting: Drop a bomb on it Flex)

[Verse 15: A$AP TWELVY]
Yo, I’m like die another day
Try another day
Niggas dying everyday
I’m just tryna get away
Feeling nice up in the stu’
I’m just tryna get my pay
Is he tryna play it safe
Well I’m tryna make ya shake
Break the bank
Like my nigga Q all up in your safe
I got this bitch think I’m cute
All up in my face
If she move like she gotta move
She can get a spade
If I do what I gotta do
I could get a plate
Feel it’s hard up in these street
I’ve been starving for some weed
Fuck the stardom, I’ll take the fuckin’ sneakers off your feet
Look at me, so unique, tell you niggas I’m just living like a G
In the land of the free, I’m just tryna be me
See, free is the only way to be motherfucker
(Chanting: Drop a bomb on it Flex)

[Verse 16: A$AP FERG]
I jump like Wesley in White Men Can’t Jump
Don’t touch my shoes, these ain’t Reebok Air Pumps
I’m balling different these Yves Saint Laurent
I’m telling you I put crosses on them like AND-1
I’m Shamguard with the Vanguard
I’m a damn Lord not a damn guard
Most of you like damn broads
Pocket full with tampons
Sickening
Get a teaspoon of this medication
Keep working and watch he boom of a dedication
Blow up like its detonation, so much I could dead a nation
Martin had a dream? Well I be blacking like its segregation
Hold up? What I say? I said I’m not Madoff
But I made off, scheming on niggas pay off
I never take a day off
Your stache is shaved off, like Adolf Hitler
You should lay off, on the game you talk ‘cause you fake dog
You never pushed no yay dog
Ain’t seen no keys like Ray Charles
It’s me and Meek in a Maybach
We get Wale and take off
We got your bitch in a big house
She walkin’ hype like “Hey Rock, how you doing?”
Get with her and take her now we ballin
Out to the Lakers how we ballin’
Like you vacant, you probably catching the vapors
House on a hill, fucked your girl and your neighbors
Thinking Khloe don’t know me? I’m in the Kardashian haven
I’m in a Kardashian, I’m lying, can’t I pretend?
They say fake it ‘til you make it
Well let the faking begin
I got a bitch with fake titties, fake ass she all in the Benz
Titties will probably fall like a ball when she bend
My niggas from Harlem, and Philly all get it in
If your bitch come around us, we fucking her and a friend[Hook: A$AP Ferg]
Point em out where he at, chrome nine point the Mac
Sit him down, in the trap, four pound for the strap
Big guns go BRAP! A$AP, where it's at
Real niggas all black, sip lean so relax

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Young Trap Lord, dime of the purp
Ride or die boy, nigga get murked
Pull a nine boy, play with the dirt
Laying on who sleep in the earth
She feel on my clothes, she lifting her skirt
She say she love coke, she sniffin the work
Semi-auto Tec, guns go flur
Bang, bang-bang and another one squirt
Givenchy my body, Ksubi my colleagues
Versace, my eyelids, but it Yves Saint-Laurent me
Twelvyy in Huraches, and Margiela on Rocky
Yohji Yamamoto for Ty Nast and Ty Beats
Fuck bitches that's on me, wack bitches move kindly
Last niggas of a dying breed, yeah me, myself, and Irene
Niggas hear them sirens when that four-fif' and that nine squeeze
China bitch sip sake, while I chop that ass with that Tommy

[Hook]

[Verse 2: A$AP Twelvyy]
We all want that Meech money, gold grill make ya speak funny
My eyes open cause the streets hungry
A New Jack fuckin' Gee money
Niggas dead over sneak money, shit ain't sweet, honey
The streets love me, white Airs and a peach rugby
I go hard cause them niggas thought the least of me
I'm in the hell yeah that bitch made a beast of me
Hold your crib, while your bitch make a feast of me
I'm a greedy nigga stuffin' my face
Gettin' money, fuckin' bitches, yeah, them stuck in my ways
'bout to turn 23 but I give zero fucks
Niggas wanna sign me, tell them niggas zero up, wassup

[Hook]

[Verse 3: A$AP Nast]
It's a pistol poppin' business nigga mind ya own
Expensive taste in guns, shorty's coppin' chrome
I'm in love with a chopper dog, hit 'em, get 'em, split 'em
Turn a fuck nigga into a bowl of pasta dog, I'm not at all
A nigga to be fucked with, shorty got the hammer, niggas can't touch this
Moms got the biscuit, dad own a musket, gone off a substance
Middle finger up to the bitch who would fuck shit
Living in a world where young niggas run shit
All over something, but it's really nothing
Go on with the fuck shit, young niggas run this all

[Hook][Intro: ASAP Rocky]
Yo, ASAP here
We 'bout to kill a fucking game
You know who the fuck we are
You know my motherfucking name
I fucked your dame
And she bought me a chain
And a range
And a pinky ring, bling, bling
And all my niggas here, they about to kill this shit
What you say Nast?

[Verse 1: ASAP Nast]
Hold up dog, Nast in this bitch again
Sipping Hen, staring at that white girl from Michigan
She was with a friend, fat ass fly ho
I went in for the kill, ASAP, pronto
So wait boo, 'fore we hit your condo
Got another friend with me named Whitney from Chicago
Whitney love ta model? I'm thinkin' ménage
The truck parked out from, the Chevy get Ta-hoes
Haters all in my face, can't see, blindfold
? on my feet, blew right by folks
Stuntin' on sucker niggas is what I was designed for
Dead fresh, fresh to death, I should have designed clothes
But I'm blessing these tracks, sick flow, swine flu
Y'all ain't fucking with Nast, I been nice, y'all knew
Haha, nigga that shit times two
I'm who your bitches wanna kick it with, kung-fu
But what, dog? What is you saying?
Nast in this bitch, ho, why is you playing?
Like I won't slay this stage on some gang shit?
Turn into a mayhem, beat hard, flow hurtin
Cali swag bitch, snapback, no jerkin'
Fuck work, fuck money in hands, hoes know this
Fast forward, past focus, I'm that on it
One of the best to do, I think not, you bet on it
Giant ass you be lumberjack Paul Bunyon
Hoes love it, lover never put none above it
Wanna hug me tighter than jeans ass sportin'
Carry corpses to cemeteries, that's very often
Sport fortune, Matchboxes, that awesome

[Verse 2: SPACEGHOSTPURRP]
So what I say, motherfucker
Already know I never been a sucker
See I lust ya, I want ya
Baby come home, babygirl, what's your name, Wanda?
Do you wanna get up on me?
Do you wanna bend over?
Do you feel horny?
Do you wanna feel the stroke?
It's kind of like Facebook when you feel a poke
ASAP, no joke
Raider Klan, all back and we aiming at your throat

[Verse 3: ASAP Rocky]
I wanna rock but the bitches want me, though
D&G briefs fit a nigga like a Speedo
Skinny nudie jeans, though
Boots be 40 below
He flow, 100 degrees, the jewels zero
Rockstar rap, he reps Guitar Hero
Leopard Louboutins like Speedo on Steve-O
Charge me on the game, couldn't pause me on Tivo
Beyonce, the Kanye, I got a big ego
On to that next shit, you looking at the bestest
Married to the game, treat you niggas like my stepkids
Pull up in a Porsche, niggas get nausea
Didn't write the rules but my status like the author
Just crashed the range, so I pulled the Bent out
Probably getting brains, chilling in the penthouse
Swagging on you maggot and I'm about to lay the pimp down
Christian Louboutin red bottoms come in mens now
On to the next ones, skinny jeans fit in
Pull up to the shows and these hoes know to get in
Said they like my fitted clothes down to my split ends
Little do she know, I got a big ego
Automatic weapon need an order of protection
Killin Feelin all these records so my charges is molesting
Assault with deadly weapons, got these rappers feeling threatened
A hip-hop veteran, I'm a hip-hop felon

[Verse 4: ASAP Twelvy]
It's a war going on outside and we started it
Believe that or die, nigga, on some martyr shit
All my niggas on the scene like some Sparta shit
And we came to double up on that Harlem shit
We all eating, this is how it's supposed to go
Stop speaking, this is how you supposed to flow
The ins and out, never a winner's route
I never lose again, it's like every day I lose a friend
To some dumb shit, whore and dumb bitch
So a hating nigga, whore cuff wrists
I know a lot of niggas sitting in a cell now
For the shit I've done, I'm probably even hell-bound
But it's cool with me, jacking niggas' jewelry
I don't give a fuck about your foolery
Nigga keep a tool with me just to blast at you bitches
Marvelous at the top and our rags to the riches
ASAP, nigga

[Verse 5: ASAP Ferg]
On my Pokemon shit, you already know...
I said, I said, I said
I swear to God I want it all
He gon' give it to me back
And get on top (?)
Purple label sweats, I swear to god I'm rich
And once I get these many bitches, swear to God I'm in
I be on my fucking shit, toast to the Gods, tell me what God sipping now
Henny, and I'm out here and my dad was in bed
So I down a whole bottle on that bitch with the mink
I go haaaaaaaard
I'm sorry, Mama Ferg, for all of these curse words
But I'm so fucking serious
Shit I'm street, like a curb
And I'm tweaked, like a nerve
And I'm smart, like a nerd
Guess that's why my last name Ferg
Okay I'm glidin' like a fucking bird
Yeah my name is Ferg but I'm a fucking terror, ya heard?
Now I'm on some rider shit
You done got yourself in beef
Now you on some Gaga shit
Red line on some Prada shit
Now you want to know the deadline on some Project shit
Black bitch an actor, put em in some toddler shit
Pu-ray you buried then hair dyed like that Robyn bitch
This ain't no bullshit, I ain't letting no fools in
See my bitch ride that big thing, you on that little shit
Trying to make noise, you squeaking like a little pit
Put her into that dog, my attitude's a little Vick

[Verse 6: ASAP Rocky]
Next time my niggas fall back
ASAP Raider Clan and we all blacked out
Tell that bitch get it mapped out
And I fucked a bitch, now she flat out
Chest out, on the fucking floor, never hit it raw
Got a condom and I got a towel by the door
Just in case the smoke go into the hallways
Cause I be smoking weed and fucking all day
This is off the top of the dome, let me introduce my niggas before a nigga go home
We got Ty Beats, the illest producer in the streets
You know he come through with that motherfucking heat
Got Twelvy, motherfucking Twelvy, got a bad bitch, Jewish named Shelby
Got my nigga Nast in the back
Got a snapback to the back, he don't even know how to act
Got my nigga named Purrp, Spaceghostpurrp, do your bitch real dirt
That's dirty, little flirty, fucked a bitch named Purdy, did her dirty
Got my nigga named Ferg, what's the word
And you know he fucking know these verbs, give them to the curb
Got nerve in the bitch, got served, better get mine nigga, bitches got nerve
Wait your turn
[Peace out, or kiss my ass!

[ASAP Ferg]
Yeah, kiss my ass too!]

[ASAP Nast]
Suck a nigga dick or somethin'![Sample]

[Intro]

Talk to me nice or don’t talk to me at all, big money shit

[Refrain]
All of these bitches is on me
All of my bitches is rocking Devoni

[Interlude]
Talk to me nice or don't talk to me at all

[Verse 1]
This that fucking nigga, Fergen-stein
And I’m finna shine, cause a nigga on his grind
Sipping that lean and I'm finna lose my fucking mind
Kissing codeine and I fucking commit crime, see ya hear me?
Niggas know with me! Bobby, Whitney, spit that crack
Got that Mac, in the back of the Acura black
As matter of fact, get them facts, right
Coming through with the fucking gun or the knife
Do you want your wife, do you want your life, tell me nigga
And I got that heater, you know that Tommy Hilfiger

[Interlude: Ty Beats]
Ty Beats the God, A$AP Ferg the God, we A$AP
Talk to me nice or don’t talk to me at all, big money

[Bridge]
Herringbone on my neck, bulletproof my vest
Shorty get in my Lex, she about to give me sex
Cause of my Rolex, giving me dope neck
Back to the studio, now she fucking the whole clique

[Interlude: Nast]
Nasty baby, nigga crack in the sock, 90's nigga, uh

[Verse 2: Nast]
What a mothafuckin' day
Nasty back and I'm strapped with that mothafuckin' AK
Got this crack up in my, sock
And these coppers on my dick, they tryna catch me on the fucking block
Rat-tat-tat when I squirt
I don't give a damn about your life so I'mma lay you in this fucking dirt
Now get in my hearse, should have got him a purse, niggas is pussy
I said it don't push me, I’m all on my grind and they can’t overlook me
I style in my Stussy, hoes wanna do he
Like him in a Ksubi, come get at this coochie, I'm smelling like "ooo wee"
Rubbing your booty while I'm smoking a loosie in my jacuzzi
I told that bitch, if you feel it, might be woozie, come and see me
I can hit it in a, in a movie, then I'm leaving
Out to my city, where I be breezing, I come through sneezing
Up on that track just how I do it, I'm speaking the fluent
You talking that shit, I’m one of the new kids, just spitting up fluid, bitch[Hook 2x]
My yute, dem boys, dem a flex
Clap with the nine, better aim for your chest (Lawd)

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
It ah ring? It ah ring
A little Fergenstein with a little Shabba Ranks
A train of Jamaican girls that love the Cuban links
Got 'em wining like Lil Kim in bikini minks
No Limit soldier with a bunch of little tanks
Hit 'em where it hurts, make them dudes feel the pain
Blood stain on what remains for two gold chains
White gold on my gums like cocaine
'Rari and Jaguar switching four lanes
Top down screaming out, "Money ain't a thang"

[Hook]

[Verse 2: A$AP Twelvyy]
I bet the lord never worries, couple niggas buried
See the good die young, gun shots then it's bury
So I'm off in a hurry, I ain't forcing no jury
To convince me, trill shit, I'm trying to stay big free
Got a budget for the lawyer, risk my freedom on the corner
It ain't worth it, making history is more important
My thoughts are soaring, smoking power, Mighty Morphin
Trip to Fiji in the morning, getting jiggy with a foreign
Look I just finished touring, Worldwide residential
It all started with a pencil, now my suite presidential
Laid up with a bad chick, that never had shit
Hold diamonds and guns, you think I'm mad rich

[Hook]

[Verse 3: A$AP Nast]
From a crack hole down in hells gate
To a new breath of air and a brighter day
It's a lighter way, I feel good enough
To buy a bunch of real estate, move my mother out her space
Why? Cause it's the new power anthem
And nigga, we the new black panthers
Get your hands up, we in it for the ransom
Money, power, respect: LOX gave us the answer
New World Order say Always Strive and Prosper
I know God is watching over me, wash away my sins
Now I'm in this bitch a longer stay, A$AP nigga
Tell my cousin that I'm on my way, in a hurry
Fuck a hater, I just gotta tie my waist

[Hook]

[Verse 4: A$AP Ant]
City on my back like I run a campaign
Baltimore USA, that's my domain
Used to sip mad dog, now it's champagne
Used to rock the bus, now I catch a damn plane
Got a white chick who love cocaine
Chill with filled with a young boys pain
Rob anybody that got a gold chain
From Baltimore where you here the shots rang
Peanut butter insides be the wood grain
Pull up in an all white paints #Balmain
'bout to blow like nitro, propane already

[Hook]

[Verse 5: A$AP Rocky]
I wrote this shit in business class, give me jet lag
This for years of oppressions and the set backs
This for chinks, niggas, jews and the wet backs
Crackers towel heads and I can't forget the les, drags
This is Huey Newton with the uzi shooting
The trill Martin Luther fin to spark the ruger
Malcolm X's muslim army marching to ya block
Bring the chopper to your preacher's screaming hallejuehah!
Dear Mr. President, I'm the shit
Hello, White America, suck my dick
They say Lords Never Worry, no hope for the kids
Young blood was a thug caught slugs from a crip
My father, our father, God father
Glocks in the air, HiiiPower
This is Kendrick off a visit Jimi's watch tower
A longer, seems like Martin dreaming for the longest

[Hook][Intro]
Uh, Alright
Nast

What's that Nast? Look like a Uzi
Long dick nigga, bitches love to screw me
Niggas hating oh, tell them niggas sue me
Say it to my face, rip ‘em like some loose leaf
Smoking on that loosie (why) ‘cause life’s a bitch

In the booth nigga, I call that shit my home

[Hook]

[Verse 2: A$AP Nast]
Hater break ya neck, bitch I'm on my Busta shit
Hoes are super sneaky, that's why I never trust a bitch
ASAP to my niggas, grind hard cause that pays off
And fuck you to them haters who love they job and never take days off
Until that choppa buck, tip they frame, and knock they face off
Big blunt of that kush got me feeling like I'm Loso
‘Cause I don't see nobody, it's like these niggas went ghost yo
Ok, she make that booty jump, like she down with Kris Kross
Rebel socialite, shout my nigga Kristoff

And they mad cause I get chips yo, oh they shining through them thangs
Always Strive And Prosper gang and my click is iller, we run this mane
Damn eat, and we hunters mane, hunt ya down and that gun go bang

Black man in this white world, ?

[Hook][Intro]
Uh, swag swag swag swag swag
Bitch, swag swag swag, uh

[Verse 1]
I been on a mission for a minute in my zone
Not concerned what all of these niggas actin like bitches throwin salt
So, fact is like to say he livin' he ain't livin' it at all
I throw money at these bitches in the minute that they call
Thats when i'll be up in they draws
Puttin' graffiti in the wall
Pussy poppin on that hand-stand, after that she hit the floor
Rackin them dollars, get that dough
Fuck you think im ballin' for?, grabbin' my jacket,robber mask(?)
I got shoe-strings touchin' the floor, middle finger to that low
Grippin' my pistol, standin tall
Get my point across with words, dont make that cannon get involved
Cause if that cannon get involved, I can guarantee you piece
Only a pillow and some sheets, cause you sleep
R.I.P, Rest in peace nigga
Fuck yo beef nigga, and we in these streets

Windows down so bitches can see
You rollin along?, come fuck with some Gs
Roll with the best you ever seen

Cause I can keep shit G bitch, uh

Fucked yo bitch, and her friend

(?)
Fightin these demons off, one of myself
Disguisin myself in these clothes, (?)
(?)
This is how we do it man, in the mothafuckin' east[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
A$AP! Guess who just came up?
From the land of milk and honey, where the thing bust
Spray the Mac-11 'til a nigga sprang up
And it's snakes in the grass but the bitch ain't cut
That lean and that Tussin be up in my cup
Slanging that drugs, there's no stretching no cut
Four gold chains, same color was the slugs
And a chain with a plate saying, "Don't give a fuck"

[Verse 2: A$AP Twelvyy]
I be on that block, be on that stoop
Tryna get cash for the coop
Get cash for the coop, got Da$h in the loop
Might spaz on your troop, cause that's what I do
More fashionable with a bad bitch or two
All of my tools, all of my jewels
Man, I'm awfully cool, all of these dudes
Watching all of our moves, I'm offing these fools

[Verse 3: Da$h]
Henny in my cup, half a blunt in my jaws
Said fuck court, now I'm running from the law
Paid the attorney, I give a fuck about the charge
Think the ho's Matlock, way to get a nigga off
Feeling like Kurt Cobain, black bitch love cocaine
Learn my tricks from the dope game
Young and high die tryna get rich
R. Kelly really think that I can fly in this bitch?

[Verse 4: A$AP Ant]
Blow in her nose got crack on the stove
House full of girls, who know my flow
Real-ass nigga keep the burner in my draws
Pussy-ass niggas get the full clip y'all
Rich-ass nigga house got eight dogs
Two times four broads, that's eight broads
Fly young nigga with the Black Scale on
She loving my music, she singing my songs

[Verse 5: A$AP Ferg]
Bang 'em, get Halle Berry when I spray 'em
Dump 'em in the garbage, I would "Losing Issiah" 'em
Ah, damn, Young Fergy turn into a satan
Got you laying dead, mothafucka, better say your prayers
AK 'em, brrrr in that dirt you be laying
Mama gon' be crying, won't you hear that preacher singing
He be singing like, "Welcome to the crossroads"
Bang 'em, pull the trigger, middle finger when you hear them shots spraying

[Verse 6: A$AP Nast]
Just bought new shoes, that's Prada
New crib out in Cali smoking maui
With my niggas, like I oughta, A$AP 'member that
Now my niggas 'bout to blow, like propane
Yeah, I talk about Raf like I talk about rap
But it's only cause I'm flossing, take it up another notch
See they like our sound, it's so amazing
They say it costs to be the boss
We done earned our spot, y'all niggas tryna take it
Jock a little bit of steez from the set
But it's cool, probably thought I wouldn't say shit
It's a recession in the hood, I ain't going back home
Every dollar, I'mma make it
Won't stop 'til we ball like the Lakers, bitch[Verse 1: A$AP ROCKY]
Look, I’m out for presidents that represent me
Benz and Bentley, head from Lindsey
Like Lohan,  nigga evidently
The hoes in every city, hella swift
Once had a bad yellow bitch
Let her strip, life ain’t been the same ever since
The oddball in a room full of elephants
My elegance take me to them other elements
With jew and jewels, a chain full of evidence
My jewelry is my jury and my face got embezzlement
Motherfuckin’ syndicate, delicate, intelligence
Connected out to the Netherlands
My music goes out and moves predicates
So mommy, tell a friends and tell a friend
Run and tell a friend and tell a friend
Email me to tell a friend
That crack I got will sell gain
Swear this purple lean is like my medicine
Could probably roll some weed and we the best of friends
Probably go to places that I never been
I heard that voice up in my head again, represent

[Verse 2: A$AP NAST]
Yo, ayo, I’m passing focus
I’m in my zone, fuck who haven’t noticed
Hoes ain’t like me, said I’m ugly, now they actin’ open
Pussy soakin’ I pimp that ho like my name Goldie
The name’s Nast, yeah, your freak know me
I beat the box, leave that thing swollen
Peace to my city with my hammer loaded
Pigs annoying like the sound of locusts
I style wild plus my rhymes the dopest
My squad’s the best, a bunch of lyrical soldiers
Rock a fella, Hova’s culture
We drink Henny like soda reject chicks like “hold up”
And know the game like we supposed to
Our lives are like the rollercoaster
The up’s and down’s keep my fam closer
No sneak attacks, these niggas can’t approach us
Damn jokers, we stack chips to keep the heat from vultures
That any day could try to run up on us, Mob life

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
Mob Life, A$AP Mob life I fuck a mob wife
I did it twice yeah I’m trife I don’t give a fuck
I kill a nigga do life do life twice you
Do 2pac like I roll dice
Put your life on the line, bet it nigga I dead it
Who said it they don’t want it with niggas who set the game
Fuck that I don’t even need a chain
I get bitches off the game, or the swagger
In the lyrics you couldn't hear it my shit exquisite

When he coming through gleamin’ because I got this bitch named Tima
And she gave me her number last summer frontin on a nigga
Now I got a number one song she running to a nigga, fuck that

[Verse 4: A$AP FERG]
Oh, you talkin’ about Tima, riding in the beamer? (yeah)
And the sneakers was looking cleaner now they all on lean up
Now I’m tipping lean up now I’m on the clean-up
‘Cause I’m cleaning all these rappers, niggas know I’m in this
Going to the cleaners with the Beamer ‘cause I got that new Versace shit
Now my shit is cleaner and I’m chilling with Flex
And your bitch give me sex, and she give me the next
When I’m grabbing her text, ‘Cause I got the tech with the vest
And you shooting at your neck, nigga you about to get it next

[Verse 5: A$AP ROCKY]
I'm so bomb, Flex drop one
Fuck that, hella hoes, Flex we got one

Gins, triggers, niggas, couldn’t fuck with us
Tommy Hilfiger, we brought it back, all of that
Starter caps and we got the naughty shorties
They love it, coming in the club with forties
Like, we couldn’t afford these
Motherfuckin’ wine and champagne bottles
Is you out your fuckin’ mind?
I could save a dime, a hundred times
If I pop it like I’m fuckin’ balling
But I ain’t, I’m shot calling
Who coming home?

[Verse 6: A$AP FERG]
Yo, yo, when you getting slow bucks they come at your name
And I come off flipping like Flex and Dame
Niggas don’t know I stay flexin’ on ya dame
And that bitch gave me the ass, she gave me the brain

[Verse 7: A$AP ROCKY & A$AP FERG]
Until 50 cent run up and take your chain
He ain’t gonna do that to me ‘cause I got that thing
Oh shit, I heard he with the G-Unit gang
Ay, but we with that A$AP MOB

[Verse 8: A$AP ROCKY]
Shout outs to Slow Buds
That’s my nigga, he know its love
I give no fucks
I know this bitch named Simmy she gives me floor fucks
You know I gave about four bucks
‘Cause she a known ho, but you know, keep that on the low though
I walk down yellow brick like Toto
I got a four do’, ruby slippers, I got my bitch with her
She got a bitch Suzie with her
And you know I did it in the Jacuzzi
And you remember them bitch from back in the day
With the finger waves?

[Verse 9: A$AP FERG]
You talking about Suzie, in the Jacuzzi?
Wearing Gucci? She got the fat coochie
With the big ass booty? (uh huh) I remember that shorty
She was drinking a forty and she was acting naughty
Yeah, I like to get up in the red though
And she liked my clothes and she liked my earlobes

[Verse 10: A$AP ROCKY]
Yeah though, but you know, she likes to fuck with the weirdos
We don’t do those, I’m a werewolf, we don’t wear those
I like the bitches, the birds, I flock ‘em, I’m a scarecrow
Flacko be the name, yeah ho, fuck that shit it’s my year though
Nast what you said, remember the bitch that would give…

[Verse 11: A$AP NAST]
We shot but we don’t ever hear though
I’m here but I’m not like air though
I put the shot to your earlobe
Yo Nasty style, nasty baby, and I’m wild
Who that? That’s the kid, go ask about him
Hold up, niggas throw...from the bottom
Fuck that...

[Verse 12: A$AP ROCKY]
I got one question, while you flowing
Flex been doing this for years so he knowing
We got it open and you know this shit clean
Ayo, Flex you a vet, can I get a sixteen?
What’s popping man? Let me hear something
Drop a bomb for the town nigga
(I don’t even have a ten or a twelve)

[Verse 13: A$AP NAST]
I’m out for presidents who represent me
I’m hardcore buzzing, ain’t got time for stunting
Ain’t got time for nothing, I’m that new era quit your speculation boy
That’s nasty baby, now he crazy, like , who fucking with the boy?
Super lowed out, I had my team, my sneaks, my jeans and all that
Perform in all black, your bitch is wet like where her draws at?
I’ve had in all that, I’ve fucked her once and never call back
Can’t trust these dusty bitches on my ballsack
Fuck with the door cracked, you clowns can  hate or get your skull cracked
When I be wasted, taking blunts of Cali’s finest took each to the face
I know complacent G’s, warm-hearted the rapper-type, that act alike
No we don’t rap alike, the flow courageous, son of Satan, we up

[Verse 14: A$AP ANT]
YG Addie back on that bullshit
Like Carl Ripken when the ball hit
Y’all broke niggas giving out no tips
Y’all order one bottle, y’all share sips
You got no hoes nigga you ain’t no pimp
I about to touch the sky see my name on a blimp
Bought Coke white air-1’s looking like a mint
Lint on your pocket looking real famished
Get a little buzz then y’all vanish
I’m over the pot, I’m doing magic
I rush like a brick, real tannish
I speak into the plug in Spanish
I got a dope strip, out in Kansas
I ride on a horse like a bandit
Send me back in school like a fucking campus
Free crack, free crack I whip in the wrist
I got a red-nosed chick  just like a pit
(Chanting: Drop a bomb on it Flex)

[Verse 15: A$AP TWELVY]
Yo, I’m like die another day
Try another day
Niggas dying everyday
I’m just tryna get away
Feeling nice up in the stu’
I’m just tryna get my pay
Is he tryna play it safe
Well I’m tryna make ya shake
Break the bank
Like my nigga Q all up in your safe
I got this bitch think I’m cute
All up in my face
If she move like she gotta move
She can get a spade
If I do what I gotta do
I could get a plate
Feel it’s hard up in these street
I’ve been starving for some weed
Fuck the stardom, I’ll take the fuckin’ sneakers off your feet
Look at me, so unique, tell you niggas I’m just living like a G
In the land of the free, I’m just tryna be me
See, free is the only way to be motherfucker
(Chanting: Drop a bomb on it Flex)

[Verse 16: A$AP FERG]
I jump like Wesley in White Men Can’t Jump
Don’t touch my shoes, these ain’t Reebok Air Pumps
I’m balling different these Yves Saint Laurent
I’m telling you I put crosses on them like AND-1
I’m Shamguard with the Vanguard
I’m a damn Lord not a damn guard
Most of you like damn broads
Pocket full with tampons
Sickening
Get a teaspoon of this medication
Keep working and watch he boom of a dedication
Blow up like its detonation, so much I could dead a nation
Martin had a dream? Well I be blacking like its segregation
Hold up? What I say? I said I’m not Madoff
But I made off, scheming on niggas pay off
I never take a day off
Your stache is shaved off, like Adolf Hitler
You should lay off, on the game you talk ‘cause you fake dog
You never pushed no yay dog
Ain’t seen no keys like Ray Charles
It’s me and Meek in a Maybach
We get Wale and take off
We got your bitch in a big house
She walkin’ hype like “Hey Rock, how you doing?”
Get with her and take her now we ballin
Out to the Lakers how we ballin’
Like you vacant, you probably catching the vapors
House on a hill, fucked your girl and your neighbors
Thinking Khloe don’t know me? I’m in the Kardashian haven
I’m in a Kardashian, I’m lying, can’t I pretend?
They say fake it ‘til you make it
Well let the faking begin
I got a bitch with fake titties, fake ass she all in the Benz
Titties will probably fall like a ball when she bend
My niggas from Harlem, and Philly all get it in
If your bitch come around us, we fucking her and a friend[ASAP Rocky]
I'm who these ladies love, who your main bitch lust for
Mounts of dead presidents, and I ain't talking Rushmore
Codeine and syrup got my safe like the drugstore
Hating niggas, niggas hating, bitches hating -- fuck, boy
She a gold-digger, but who am I to judge her?
We above the law, who am I to cuff her?
It's obvious she want me, mayne
You could try to [fuck her]
I be swimming in these women, I'm the scuba diver lover
Known around the globe but Harlem's where I be at
Same home as Cam'ron, and I ain't talking Diaz
Flame spitter nigga, guaranteed to get a heat rash
Ballin all seasons, subscribe for your league pass
Rap Simon London, Louis Vuitton Don shits
Christian Louboutain for guys with red bottoms
Yves St. Laurent kicks, Christian Dior sponsors
Thesis snapbacks like I'm straight outta compton
Rick Owens, I own 'em
Margiellas, I did 'em
Y3's, we on it
Alexander, we miss 'im
I'm talking 'bout the king, yes, Alexander McQueen
May he live, rest in peace, and we do it through our jeans

[ASAP Nast]
I'm trying to tell 'em I see my future as crystal-clear
Shine like some crystal, yeah, so I keep pistols near
Not far at all, one reach, that's all
You sleep, sleep in the back of some old Ford pickup
On the side of the road
Cold, cold world, no J
No way, Jose
N.A. all day
S.T., that's me
Ask why, and you wonder why my flow go over guys
Who want a horse and drive
But you often find it's coffin time, no Pokemon
Plate still stuffed to the top, but ain't no pork on mine
It's quite often I could come up with Mighty Morphin rhymes
Fool think he fucking with Nast, must have lost his mind

Turn a fuck nigga into a bowl of pasta dog, I'm not at all
A nigga to be fucked with, shorty got the hammer, niggas can't touch this
Moms got the biscuit, dad own a musket, gone off a substance
Middle finger up to the bitch who would fuck shit
Living in a world where young niggas run shit
All over something, but it's really nothing
Go on with the fuck shit, young niggas run this all

See them flowers gone grow and the power gon' raise
And we came through the door, here we got us a race

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
All these diamonds in my teeth
I'm gone off a gallon of Hennessy
Better let your bitch go cause she's feeling me
And besides she a ho, she fucked him and me
And I gave her the beast like I'm Timothy
Moonwalk in that pussy like Billie Jean
And I open your chest like you Janet Jackson
And I blam-blam like you Timberlake
I put him in a lake and I penetrate
Let it sit in your face like a dinner date
Then bust open your grill, let it ventilate
And my niggas is killers, what can I say?
With a crew of gorillas like 50 Cent
And they peelin' bananas, no dinner plate
And I'm only gone ride with my syndicate

Went past the pawnbrokers saw a diamond watch
So I threw a few dow and looked like a boss
Boy,boy,boy I be dealing dope
Until my life changed and know I,m being dope
Only 14 blue cheese in my roll up
Chill in a Lac now you watch me roll up

And Nast was cuffin'
He wanted to take the bitch on a little date
And it comes to find out, his black ass couldn't even penetrate
(So what I caught the fuckin' head

Tippin 4's since back in 06
Won't you see a nigga getting throwed bitch
Two middle fingers to the show, bitch

[Verse 3: ASAP Nast]
All hell here, bitch it's Satan talking

We sold our minds, I lost my mind
But that's all lies, because I'm all fine
I got this game, this bitch is mine

[Hook] x4
Bitch I'm cold
Bitch I'm cold
Yeah, bitch I'm cold
Yeah, yeah, bitch I'm cold
Uh

[Bridge] x2
Ride wit a real nigga
Ride wit a real nigga
Ride wit a real nigga
Ride ride wit a real nigga

[Verse 2: Da$H]
Roll a couple grams, black ho with a tan
Bands don't just make her dance
Bet the bitch will fuck my friends
Feeling like I'm Cam nigga, put her on the cam nigga
And she got a man, she only love me for my jams damn
I'm drunk as a fish, inhaling a spliff
Can't you see I'm loaded
And I won't stop till I'm dead or I'm rich
Young niggas control it
Fold niggas like clothing
Take my side, what you opposin
Leave him stiff like he was posin
Never scared of overdosin, yup
Asked for a pill, handed her two
Say you get high, then prove it then boo
Ordered a 'tel, call up your crew
And we set it up just like Jada would do
True, they say the real niggas don't lie
You was never close to I
So I suggest you never try

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Verse 3: A$AP Ferg]
Trap lord and I'm righteous
Cozy boy and I'm still reclinin
Bad bitch in manolo blahnik
I pump that ass like that colonic
Feel the bass and that beat knockin
Can't see my face, I'm beneath the stockin
Stocky nigga but the heat brolic
Get your head chopped like supersonic
Yamborghini in a Lamborghini
Margiela bitch in that red bikini
French bitch suck seven weewees
Ask Rock if you don't believe me
Mobbing hard with my mob
Trap lord the young god
ASAP we go hard
Brraaap boy in yo car
Lay flat boy, it's yo gun
Feeling like a task force with that chrome
Feeling like I'm Flex boy with that bomb (BOOM)
Tec spray like cologne
Better get that tec boy you're so gone
Hit him in the neck, jaw and his arm
You better not flex boy when I zone
Cause I draw guns like Crayons

[Hook][Intro: A$AP Nast]
A$AP is the trillest daaaaaawg

Evacuate the buildin' for the children
The children, gettin' all the chitlins

Bitches say I'm cocky wit' a limp dick

All my niggas get fly with they - ahh
And we fuckin' rappin' off the tone
They don't know how we do we rappin' off the dome

[Verse 2: A$AP Twelvy]
Yo, block hugger, clock puncher

Matter of fact drunk as a bitch, matter of fact dunk in ya bitch
On my blake shit, aww shit you on some safe shit
Nah I'm on some crazy 8 shit, Like adidas
Jeremoty scott, I don't rock em but Rock do

12 gauge shotgun, that'll send you to hell

[Verse 3: ASAP Ferg]
Body em wit' tha shotty
Niggas talkin' shit I'mma shoot him in his body
Rollin' in the whip, wit' the new bitch
Alexander Wayne, I got that new bitch
And a new benz-o, sittin' on Lorenzo
I pop it like a pimple, that bitch want, that bitch ho
That bitch want, that bench ho
And I get dough, and I get get, lick lick
My bitch and she know that I just flow, I get the dough in that clip
I know how to get it I do it, Rollin' around in that Buick
Niggas know that's stupid, gettin' money I scoop it
A$AP went black, to the nigga all that
Rat-a-tat that ass, if you talk shit get the cash
Get yo ass smacked when I'm talkin' shit, niggas know I'm too legit
Hammer pants, I'm Too Legit 2 Quit, when I grip that hammer blit

[Verse 4: A$AP Nast]
Yo fuck it, I'm like fuck it

I'm just chillin' up in my zone like I got it
This shit is all for the Profit
A$AP, we comin' through and we mobbin'
We killin' shit with no problem[Sample]
One, two, umm
Buckle my, umm

[Verse 1: Rocky]
Pass the mothafuckin' Swisher, pour some mothafuckin' liquor
For my mothafuckin' niggas who ain't wit us, keep it trilla
My gold teeth, my french braids, getting throwed since 10th grade
Wealth is in the mind, not the pocket, if that's the case, then I been paid
Herringbone chain, my gold frames, my Cartiers, you small change
You bitch made, I'm old school like gemstars and switchblades
I spit game, I get paid, a pimp game
I be, I be that pretty muthafucka, A$AP is just my nickname
(I'm comin' down when I'm tippin' on them 4's
Cause we shittin' on these, shittin' on these niggas and these hoes)
Cause that purp shit I sip up, your bitch chose, you slipped up
I get-get my dick licked, I'm draped out, drip-dripped up
Top of the top of the line, all on my grind, purple be easin' my mind
We runnin', runnin', we gunnin', gunnin', we're gonna hit one at a time, time
Them bad bitches blow kisses by my earlobe, a weirdo but I'm real though

[Verse 2: Twelvyy]
All these boppers wanna bop 'em, niggas wanna jock 'em
Not a red light or a city cop that can stop 'em
Going broke is not an option, always on that cash flow
She used to call me asshole, now she drop that ass low
Fuck it man I'm past dope, sour diesel slash coke
A$AP we the last hope, fuck it this my fast flow
I slow it down I pick it up, blue jeans I rip 'em up
That's swag bitch, you mad bitch, see you in my past bitch
I'm headed to the future, Twelvyy ain't no loser
Mixing up that syrup, call it Punky Brewster
I'm slurring wussup, don't tell me to shut up
I ain't tryna start shit, but man I'm really fucked up
I lucked up, I see it as a come up
I'm on my job man, I see you when the sun's up
Huh, young niggas run everything
A$AP to the top and these bitches love everything

[Verse 3: Nast]
God bless America, my flow is scarier
Style wild like my nigga Common after Erykah
Your bitch, I'm in bed with her, head so good
Make a nigga feel good to the point I wanna marry her
But I be on my pimping shit, check out my limp and shit
I be getting money, getting money, can you dig it, bitch?
Hoes get on my pimping ship all aboard, all aboard
East coast mothafuckas making all the noise, all the noise
I know you niggas heard of us, Raf Simon murderers
Fashion killa word to Bigga Bars, I never heard of ya
Still sipping candy painted whips is what I'm sitting in
Kitchen chemist whipping up that shit that get these bitches in
New York Nasty flow, that's a little bit of crack mixed in with a fifth of Hen
Business man, middle finger to your fucking business, man
Great adventure shit, rollercoasting take a flick of this
Motion picture shit, bitch I grind like a skater do
Always $trive and Prosper rock what level we gon' take it to?[Produced by A$AP Ty Beats]

[Intro]
Yo, yo-yo, yo
90's era Nasty, yeah
Yo, Ty Beats!

[Verse 1: A$AP Nast]
I need some time alone
Cold, my rhymes will turn your mind to stone
That's the work of satan niggas be hating but I'm a pot of gold
This ain't just me rappin' it's real and something you gots to know
Catch a mark nigga hatin', get him a casket, that bastard's 'bout to go
Whoa, Nasty baby I'm crazy, the 90's raised me
I'm just as smart, probably smarter than half the cats who play me
Brazy, driving miss daisy, hit on my strap
In my zone, mind on my money like where that shit at?
I'm all alone, that's my only hope
And be damned if I'mma chase that with some phony homes, on the real
It be the ones that say, "We got this, that you ain't alone"
As long as I'm here to pull out the Glock 9 and cocked it
He mad you got rich but on the low you should've watched him
Cats connivin', head first into the livest object
"That was your man, now you 'bout to die quick"
Over some fly shit, you feel reminded of your fast-life ventures
And winters, blinded 'til the flashlight enters

[Hook: A$AP Nast]
I got a funky-funky style with a funky swag (x2)
I bought the funky-funky Nikes got the hat to match (x2)
I got a funky-funky style with a funky swag (x2)
And when I kill 'em with the flow, ain't no comin' back (x2)

[Verse 2: Method Man]
I got a poor man's panache, I be stretching the cash
I'm a little passive aggressive, you get a stretcher when I'm mad
Borderline manic depressive, rappers stressin' me bad
Got too many less than impressive rappers left in my path
Better yet, we gon' leave 'em left in the past
Someone slides, this time I ride, you get left in the back
Who am I? I'm a titan so be expectin' a clash
Start to wavin' arms at you, you'd think I'm catchin' a cab
No questions, live the answers cause if you're lookin' to ask
Look at Meth, breakin' bad like he cookin' meth in the lab
Still a lethal weapon but try and bless him with math
Rappers never learn their lesson so I ain't lettin' 'em pass
I ain't lettin' 'em brag, I ain't lettin' 'em swag
Fuck swag, just being blunt, while I'm pluckin' my ash
Y'all ain't up in my class in the buildin'
It's A$AP Meth, quick to kill 'em, that's an ASAP death

[Hook: A$AP Nast]

[Verse 3: A$AP Nast]
Straight out the back, dog, I'm Shaq strong, I'm breakin' backboards
Draped in Tommy, my bitch beside me, young god body
I play the back of clubs, clicks are foul, youngins are rowdy
Fools get rowdy, ain't nothin' dumb, my guns from Saudi
High off the Maui, don't trip your weed, rolling the finest
You know the fronto, Sucio Guapo, I'm head honcho
I sport the poncho, connects with Sandro, the illest y'all know
Killin' 'em pronto, my funky fresh is filthy, designer
But check my rhymes though, my verse is like atomic bombs, yo
Haters like side hoes, I peel off in the illest Tahoe
Watch out for potholes, H leaning, that's why he drive slow
Nast Diablo, the 90's era shit in effect
Clowns be watching, best protect ya necks

[Hook: A$AP Nast]
