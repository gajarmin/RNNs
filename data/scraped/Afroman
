[Afroman Talking]
Wait a minute man
Hey check this out man tell it
It was this blind man right, it was this blind man right
He was feelin' his way down the street with a stick right, hey
He walked past this fish market, you know what I'm sayin'
He stopped he took a deep breath he said
Snfffffff, woooo good morning ladies, ha
You like that shit man
Hey man I've got a gang of that shit man
Hey I'll tell you what
We'll all have a good time
We'll pull on the drug
And hey, hey if everybody crowd around the mike
I'll tell you all these motherfuckin' jokes I got
First I'm gonna start off like that, hey help me sing it homeboy

[Hook]
Said colt 45 and two zigzags baby thats all we need
We can go to the park, after dark
Smoke that tumbleweed
As the marijuana burn we can take our turn
Singin' them dirty rap songs
Stop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong
And sell tapes from here to Hong Kong
So roll, roll, roll my joint, pick out the seeds and stems
Feelin' high as hell flyin' through Palmdale
Skatin' on Dayton rims
So roll, roll, the '83 Cadillac Coupe Deville
If my tapes and my cds just don't sell, I bet my Caddy will

[Verse 1:]
Well it was just sundown in small white town
They call it East Side Palmdale
When the afroman walked through the white land
Houses went up for sale
Well I was standing on the corner sellin' rap cds
When I met a little girl named Jan
I let her ride in my Caddy
Because I didn't know her daddy was the leader of the Ku Klux Klan
We fucked on the bed
Fucked on the floor
Fucked so long I grew a fuckin' afro
Then I fucked to the left (left)
Fucked to the right (right)
She sucked my dick 'til the shit turned white
Thought to myself sheeba-sheeba
Got my ass lookin' like a zebra
I put on my clothes and I was on my way
Until her daddy pulled up in a Chevrolet
And so I ran I jumped out the back window
But her daddy he was waitin' with a two-by-four
Oh, he beat me to the left
He beat me to the right
The motherfucker whooped my ass all night
But I ain't mad at her prejudiced dad
That's the best damn pussy I ever had
Got a bag of weed and a bottle of wine
I'm gonna fuck that bitch just one more time

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
I met this lady in Hollywood
She had green hair but damn she looked good
I took her to my house because she was fine
But she whooped out a dick that was bigger than mine
I met this lady from Japan
Never made love with an African
I fucked her once, I fucked her twice
I ate that pussy like shrimp-fried rice
Don't be amazed at the stories I tell ya (tell ya)
I met a woman in the heart of Australia
Had a big butt and big titties too
So I hopped in her ass like Kangaroo
See I met this woman from Hawaii
Stuck it in her ass and she said "AIEE"
Lips was breakfast, pussy was lunch
Then her titties busted open with Hawaiian Punch
I met Colonel Sanders wife in the state of Kentucky
She said I'd fry some chicken if you'd just fuck me
I came in her mouth, it was a crisis
I gave her my secret blend of Herbs' n' Spices

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
I met Dolly Parton in Tennessee
Her titties were filled with Hennessy
That country music really drove me crazy
But I rode that ass and said yes Miss Daisy
Met this lady in Oklahoma
Put that pussy in a coma
Met this lady in Michigan
I can't wait 'til I fuck that bitch again
Met a real black girl down in South Carolina
Fucked her until she turned into a white albino
Fucked this hooker in Iowa
I fucked her on credit, so I owe her
Fucked this girl down in Georgia
Came in her mouth, man I thought I told ya
Met this beautiful sexy ho
She just ran across the border of Mexico
Fine young thing said her name's Maria
I wrapped her up just like a hot tortilla
I wanna get married but I can't afford it
I know I'm'a cry when she get deported

[Hook]

[Verse 4:]
Have you ever went over a girl's house to fuck
But the pussy just ain't no good
I mean you gettin' upset because you can't get her wet
Plus you in the wrong neighborhood
So you try to play it off and eat the pussy
But it take her so long to cum
Then a dude walk in, that's her big boyfriend
And he asks you where you from
So you wipe your mouth and you try to explain
You start talking real fast
But he already mad cause you fucking his woman
So he start beating on you ass
Now your clothes all muddy
Your nose all bloody
Your dick was hard but now it's soft
You thought you had a girl to rock your world
Now you still gotta go jack off

[Hook][Intro]
Wait a minute, man!
Hey check this out, man
There was this blind man, right?
He was feelin' his way down the street with a stick
He walked past this fish market
He stopped, he took a deep breath, he said:
"*Snfffffff* Whoooo! Good morning, ladies!"
You like that shit, man?
Hey man, I got a gang of that shit, man!
Hey, I'll tell you what
My man on the guitar
Fool on the drums
And hey, hey if everybody crowd around the mic
I'll tell you all these motherfuckin' jokes I got
First I'm gonna start off like that, hey help me sing it, homeboy!

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Afroman]

Afroman Palmdale, Cali get high desert
Any dope valley
When I was a boy I couldn't find a girl
Now I got women all over the world
Like Naughty Nancy from North Carolina
Back n forth in her hot vagina
Is your pussy sore?
She said kinda... She came!
People heard her screaming in China
Big Jug June down in Peru
Sucked me till my dick shrivelled up like a prune
10 minutes later my dicks high point
June smoked it like a joint
Your daughters fucked
You caught her yelling
I gotta rotate
In Cape Carteret
Doing the dime at the time
Drinking my jizz like colt 45

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 2: Afroman]

Molly, Molly Blanchete
Licked my dick like a Jolly Rancher
Drove her home from Warlington
Stuck it in her pussy cause I ain't done
Country singers from Nashville
Shaking ass smoking grass fo real
Jumped in the van with the Dixie Chicks
Checked into motherfucking Motel 6
I flew Holly to Hollywood
Pulled out my wood and fucked her good
Grandma Biggie from Ventura
Drunk ma jizz like Ensura
Dick sucker Sandy from San Diago
Won't let go my lego
So I Gave her my lego
Then I let go my eggo!

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 3: Afroman]

I fucked santa's wife in santa cruz
Took off her clothes left on the shoes
Bent her over stuffed her stocking
Right before I came I started BAKAWING!
Suck dick Sandy Sent Louis a pispo
Wheres my brand just like nebisko
Suck my dick all the way to Frisco
Came in her face, it looks like crisko
Tried to fuck a girl from Fresno
Baby said she was a lesbo
Unzipped ma pants pulled out ma wood
Took her manhood
I kept on Fucking she started cumming
I be damned she is a woman
She took off her pants and put on a dress
Got AFROMAN tattooed on her breast

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 4: Afroman]

Rimjob Rena Reno Nevada
Took every inch of my enchilada
I don't gamble but I played her slot
Pulled her titties and hit the jackpot
Titanic tits from toothesun
Gave her two daughters and two sons
Betty from Boston Massechusettes
Had a massive ass with two massive tits
I smoked some weed drunk some Bacardi
Gave her my boston teabag party!
Connie connie from Connecticut
Liked to jump into bed and give me head and shit
I gave rachel rachel from missouri
A facial (facial) until her sight was blurry
I fucked veronica from Vermont
Her sister her cousin her mum her aunt!

[Hook 2x]Just like bums, we used to stay in the slums of LA by the way
Gang-bangers killin' each other for rep, sellin' rock cocaine on my doorstep
Had a ball to bounce plus a bike to ride, but my mama never would let me play outside
But when I got enrolled in elementary school, started bangin' like a fuckin' fool
So cool, throwin' up gang signs to the gangster beat, shot an enemy from across the street
Mama came home, said she got a good job. Daddy did too. Now they don't squab
Financially, we improvin'. 2 months later, son, we movin'
No more duckin' from shotgun shells. Bought a two-story house in East Palmdale
(give it to me now.)

Palmdale, come back to me
I need you and I love you, baby
Palmdale, come back to me
(Check it out, check it out, check it out.)

No more rats and no more roaches, livin' next door to football coaches
Now I got a new place to sell me crack. Now I got little white kids to jack
I stopped wearin' blue, wasn't trippin' on red. Too busy squabbin' with the skinheads
Stupid questions, distract the class. Rubbin' little white girls on the ass
I didn't really care if I passed or failed, I knew I was headed for the NFL
Until the playoff game, shoulder got hurt. I thought about my future, layin' in the dirt
I can't jump, I can't flinch. Superstar player, ridin' the bench
Graduate from school? Don't make me laugh. I got an F+ in basic math
(give it to me now.)

Palmdale, (Hell, yeah.) come back to me
I gotta do one song for my neighborhood. Bucccoooc!
Palmdale, come back to me
(check it out.)

I knew I couldn't make it in the white man's world, so I bought me some khakis and a Geri curl
I knew I couldn't make it to the NFL, so I went to East Palmdale and started slingin' yayo
For sure! I was makin' crazy dough. Should've dropped outta school a long time ago
Bought a cell phone, like a nut. Now I deliver like Pizza Hut
I drunk whisky and Bacardi. I sold dope to anybody
Me and my homies sold dubs and dimes, took turns bustin' rhymes just to pass the time
A white man drove up to my spot. He said, Hey, homeboy, what you got?
I put a fat rock inside his hand. About 25 sheriffs jumped out the van
(Get down, punk.)

Palmdale, (Hell, yeah) come back to me
I need you and I love you, baby
Palmdale, come back to me
(check it out, check it out, check it out.)

Can't get drunk. Can't get blunted. LA County, 95 hundred
Crips wanna take my All-stars. Bloods wanna eat my Snicker bars
Them peckerwoods don't want none, but the Mexican's straight own one
Them Ese's, catorces, treces always try to test me
So I jumped off the bed, cause I ain't no punk. Jammed his head up against the bunk
Socked that Cholo in his chin. Black mother-fuckers scared to jump in
Sheriff broke it up when we hit the floor. I kept talkin' shit cause I want some more
Back in town, we get along with the brown. Now I'm in jail, they tryin' to beat me down
Jail is hell, but I'll adapt. Won't hesitate to get in a scrap
Cause I'm down for mine, and that's for certain, sittin' in the hole with my knuckles hurtin'
(Palmdale)

Palmdale, (Hell, yeah.) come back to me
I need you and I love you, baby
Palmdale, come back to me
(check it out, homeboy.)

Now I got a fucked up life. Two bad kids and a naggin' wife
Dead end job at the airport. Check too short to pay the house note
Turn on the TV, then I see different homeboys that went to school with me
Playin' in the NFL. We used to kick back in East Palmdale
Rodney Williams. Lorenz Tate. Zeno plays for Colorado State
I wish my homeboys much success, but at the same time, I still get depressed
Walkin' through the wind with a cup full of gin thinkin' 'bout things that could've, would've, should've been
I wipe my tears, sip my beers, wish good luck to my peers
(Palmdale.)

Palmdale, come back to me
I need you and I love you, baby
Palmdale, come back to me
Cause that's where my heartache began, heartache began

Palmdale, come back to me
I need you and I love you, baby
Palmdale, come back to me
Cause that's where my heartache began, heartache began

Palmdale, come back to me
(Hey, all the homeboys on the football team, where y'all at?)
Palmdale, come back to me
(Hey, wherever you at in the world, I don't care if you in Japan, Africa
Hey, you know how we used to do it, man. Hey, hey, hey.)
Yo, let me get a Palm (Palm!)
Yo, let me get a Dale (Dale!)
Yo, what do we sell? (YELL!)
Yo, where we fittin' to go? (We fittin' to go back to jail!)
[X4]

Dale. Palmdale. (Hey, everybody just clap your hands.)
Dale. Palmdale. (C'mon, c'mon, c'mon. Buci-buci-bucccoooc!)
Dale. Palmdale
Dale. (Where them Falcons at?) Palmdale. (It ain't over 'til the fat man sings.)
Dale. (Little Rock can't get none. What, what?) Palmdale
Dale. Palmdale

In the year 2000

Of pretty young women I found arousin
Grocery store shoppin
Magazine browsin
Many different ways to keep their hair styles in
Full of boredom
I walk toward em
Get em close to me
Cause I'm suppose to be
Male aggressor
Female impresser
Say the right things possibly undress her
But that's the post game
This is still the pre game
Silly woman she game
Baby what's your name
Even though I'm a freak
I play it off like a college geek
Crack a smile and politely speak
With intellect to the women I select
Hoping that she don't detect
My egotistical chauvinistical lust
I thrust till I scream like Mystikal
YAAAAAAHHHH!
The wrong message I hope I'm not sendin
Laughin and pretendin my dick's not extendin
Can't be over zealous she might discover
She's walking away BITCH! blew my cover

I think Lil John and the Eastside Boys is an ignorant, irritating bunch of noise

Who gave her a record deal, oh my god!
Nas is in the video with Kelis
Jay-z's in the video with Beyonce
Both of these rappers are whack
Yet people talk smack about 40 Delefante
The music industry is usin the slang

They can stop putting all that bullshit out
Like "what a girl want what a girl need
A fuckin job and a brand new hair weave
What a girl want what a girl need
A fuckin job and a brand new hair weave"
A bump bump bump
Now thats all I wanna do
A bump bump bump

Call up Puff Daddy ask him if he wants to do a verse with me

Real pimps get down on the flow

Why is David Banner runnin from the clan
What happened to the bitches man
Cadillac on 22's why is David Banner takin off his shoes
Its supposed to be about Cadillacs
Not David Banner bringin dead people back
Even though its all good
It might get misunderstood
Damn skippy, mississippi is the hood
Raps im writing up, I can't lighten up
Until these whack ass rappers tightin up

Missy Elliot, she looks like Halle Berry, thats scary
Her cd ain't worth it
Put you money in your pocket and reverse it
Her cd ain't worth it
Put you money in your pocket and reverse it

Missy Elliot makes a bunch of bullshit(x5)

I can't stand her music going in my ear
If you like Missy Elliot get the fuck out of here
I can't stand her music going in my ear
If you like Missy Elliot get the fuck out of here

Most rappers are whack just like the people they attract
Most rappers are whack just like the people they attract
Most rappers are whack just like the people they attract
Most rappers are whack just like the people they attract

If her attitude wasn't so shitty
Talkin bout "you tryin to come through the back door"
She ain't got no back door
What she talkin smack fo'

Male bashin with Mary J
Like queen latifa she must be gay
In my radio you gets no play not today
What the fuck happened to MTV
Why these whack people get to make a cd

I dont know man look at 50 Cent
He dont move his mouth when he rap man
He be rappin like Mike Tyson or somethin you know what im sayin
He dont move his mouth
(mumbling)
Open your mouth
(more mumbling)
Ill teach you how to stunt

Teach me how to stunt?
They need to let me teach them how to roll a fat blunt
Get high get drunk and take it easy
And stop making songs so cheesy
Now Manny Fresh is actually fresh
And Juvenille, I like his style
But the worst rapper I ever heard man
Is the whack ass mother fuckin Birdman
What about Silk the Shocker?
My name is Silk and ill shock you
Ive jus been shocked by Silk the Shocker[Intro: Afroman]

Man, my daddy told me
Boy, when I was your age
I had to walk 13 miles to school
I said, "Oh, is that why you didn't graduate?"

[Hook: Afroman]

Talkin' noise with all of my homeboys
Fit to go back to school, yeah
(Her titties bigger than they were last summer, know what I'm sayin'?)
With a mouthful of beer and a nose full of weed
You know I'm fit to act a fool, yeah

[Verse 2: Afroman]

Mama, I'mma
Go to the University of Smoking Marijuana
All of my friends go to USC
So I'm gonna tag along and hit the bong with them
Walkin' through the masses, lookin' for my classes
I can't concentrate on the teacher, surrounded by titties and asses
Spent a lot of money on some brand new clothes
Trying to impress these brand new hoes
Laugh every time I have sex with a chick
Baby don't know I'm an ex-convict
Walking round the campus with my 'fro on thick
Every twenty seconds I be grabbin' my dick
Full of alcohol at the football games
Doin' more drugs than my nigga Rick James
My GPA is dropping at a very fast rate
It would take a miracle for me to graduate
Maybe I won't, maybe I will
Stressed out, poppin' pills in my Coupe Deville

[Hook x1]

[Verse 2: Afroman]

How do I party?
And still pass
I hardly
Ever go to class
Got a golden eagle on my stolen Regal
If you bought it from me, it's illegal
Cause I'm Afroman, the educated Crip
On a rock cocaine scholarship
Cook that crack until it's done
I use that for my Negro college fund

Broke minorities, selling dope to those bitches in sororities
She's drinking one too many 40's
She took her clothes off, now we're having orgies
Baby, I don't mean to act rude
But you told me you would never fuck a black dude
Colt 45 must have got you in the mood
To eat a fat dick like some soul food

[Hook x1]

[Verse 3: Afroman]

(Hey fellas, can I get jiggy with it? Hey, check this shit out right here)

Hey homeboy, don't stress, I got the answers to the test
My college professor smokes a lot of grass
She's gonna make sure we pass
That's how you pass trigonometry
Sell dope to your teacher, use nigga-nometry
On the microphone, there's not a rapper bomb as me
And under police pressure, nobody's as calm as me
Wait a minute, you know what's fucked up
Black people in college act stuck up
So self-conscious, and insecure
You wanna speak black, but you really ain't sure
Look at me, what do you see?
You see the OG, you ashamed to be
So fuck you, you pretty little rich frat boy
You can suck my dick just like that boy

[Hook x1]

[Verse 4: Afroman]

I said, "Honey
You got some sexy looks
You need money
To buy your textbooks"
Get it wet, and I can get it hard
We can slide your vaginal credit card
Computer girl, come to my house and be my tutor girl
Before we study, can we smoke a little Buddha, girl?
Raise your shirt, lick the nipples on your hooters, girl
Open up your legs, baby you're the girl
Stick out your tongue and let me shoot it, girl
You was playing with my floppy, then my hard drive downloaded
Down your throat, and fucking exploded
Tell your prejudice dad and mom
To email their comments to suck-my-dick.com
Afro's the bomb, blowing up like Vietnam

[Hook x2][Intro: Afroman]
It's like... I don't care about nothin' man
Roll another blunt... Yeah

[Verse 9]
I'm gonna stop singing this song because I'm high
I'm singing this whole thing wrong because I'm high
And if I don't sell one copy I know why
Because I'm high (repeat 3X)

[Verse 10]
Well my name is Afroman and I'm from east Palmdale
And all the tail weed I be smokin' is bomb as hell
I don't believe in Hitler, that's what I said
So all of you skins please give me more headI had problems with glaucoma, but then I got high
Smelled the cannabis aroma, and I got high
Glaucoma getting better and I know why
Because I got high, because I got high, because I got high

I used to smoke cigarettes, but then I got high
Getting tired and call it quits, but them I got high

I woke up feeling fine, because I got high
My hangover's over and I know why
Because I got high, because I got high, because I got high

Anxiety attacks, but then I got high
I used to take Xanax, but then I got high
No more prescription pills and I know why
Because I got high, because I got high, because I got high

The state made revenue, because I got high
They built a school or two, because I got high
Now the state can fund drug treatment and I know why
Because I got high, because I got high, because I got high

No more criminal traps if it's legalised
I don't have to buy from gang bangers shooting craps, if it's legalised
I can advocate with Weedmaps and I know why
It's legalised, it's legalised, it's legalisedNobody feels like a G feels
When he post up his '64 on three wheels
Daddy ask me "what you wanna be when you grow up?"
A low rider with some Colt 45 in my cup

I was on my way to college and then saw
A Cadillac three-wheeling down Crenshaw
It was nineteen hundred and eighty three
I knew exactly what the fuck I wanted to be
A low rider, bass provider, drop down like a spider
Spy the hood rat and go straight inside her

But if she buttless
...bitch can't ride in my Cutlass

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
Running them red lights sideways
In the parks and streets, brothers keep dying
But I drop the back and let the sparks keep flying
My daddy wanted me to take the Daytons off the Dodge
Cause the 'baseheads keep breaking in the garage

I keep sagging in my 'lac with my butt out, I strut out
Look at my two front tires, you know I cut out
I took from the ghetto what I could take
But you can't take my P.O with the metal flake
I'm a knucklehead buzzing off of alcohol
Messing up a new car for no reason at all

[Hook]
Hit the switch homeboy, Hit the swiotch
Stop acting like a little old biotch
[X2]
Front and back homeboy front and back
Blaze the sac and pass back my yack
[X2]
Three wheels homeboy, three wheels
Let me see your low rider G skills
[X2]
One switch, two switch, three switch, four
Oh my God, my battery's low!
[X2]

Cali, Cali swangin'
Sound, system bangin'
[X2]

Can't stop sporting them all-stars
Can't stop driving them gangster cars
New cars just don't appeal to me
It's 2004 and I'm a still a G
Cops don't want brothers loiterin'
Gangbangers drive by and start slaughterin'
So they talk a lot of smack and write a fat ticket
But I drive around the corner, come back and still kick it
Gotta sell wheatgerm and crack, so
I can have money just in case I break a axle
I turn my music up loud to attract a crowd
Throw the hood out the window, make the homeboys proud
Keep my kahkis creased right with my girl in my ride
I used to be local but now I'm worldwide
Afromanmusic dot com blowing up like Vietnam

[Hook]

Af-ro-man-make the Cadillac coupe pan-cake
Lock it up, cock it up
Post on threes, twist on Ds
Afro as you ride her, Cadillac walk like a spider
Smash out fast then dump her, sparks straight flying from the bumper
World. Wide. Hungry. Hustler, hit that switch don't be no buster
Hop in the coupe like a toad frog, go swoop up your role dog
Cali Swangin' K.J., Go way back like heyday
Six stray, six 'fo
A. F. R. O

[Hook][Afroman Talking]
Wait a minute man
Hey check this out man tell it
It was this blind man right, it was this blind man right
He was feelin' his way down the street with a stick right, hey

Snfffffff, woooo good morning ladies, ha
You like that shit man

First I'm gonna start off like that, hey help me sing it homeboy

[Hook]
Said colt 45 and two zigzags baby thats all we need
We can go to the park, after dark
Smoke that tumbleweed
As the marijuana burn we can take our turn
Singin' them dirty rap songs
Stop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong
And sell tapes from here to Hong Kong
So roll, roll, roll my joint, pick out the seeds and stems
Feelin' high as hell flyin' through Palmdale
Skatin' on Dayton rims
So roll, roll, the '83 Cadillac Coupe Deville
If my tapes and my cds just don't sell, I bet my Caddy will

[Verse 1:]
Well it was just sundown in small white town
They call it East Side Palmdale
When the afroman walked through the white land
Houses went up for sale
Well I was standing on the corner sellin' rap cds
When I met a little girl named Jan
I let her ride in my Caddy
Because I didn't know her daddy was the leader of the Ku Klux Klan
We fucked on the bed
Fucked on the floor
Fucked so long I grew a fuckin' afro
Then I fucked to the left (left)
Fucked to the right (right)
She sucked my dick 'til the shit turned white
Thought to myself sheeba-sheeba
Got my ass lookin' like a zebra
I put on my clothes and I was on my way
Until her daddy pulled up in a Chevrolet
And so I ran I jumped out the back window
But her daddy he was waitin' with a two-by-four
Oh, he beat me to the left
He beat me to the right
The motherfucker whooped my ass all night
But I ain't mad at her prejudiced dad
That's the best damn pussy I ever had
Got a bag of weed and a bottle of wine
I'm gonna fuck that bitch just one more time

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
I met this lady in Hollywood
She had green hair but damn she looked good
I took her to my house because she was fine
But she whooped out a dick that was bigger than mine
I met this lady from Japan
Never made love with an African
I fucked her once, I fucked her twice
I ate that pussy like shrimp-fried rice
Don't be amazed at the stories I tell ya (tell ya)
I met a woman in the heart of Australia
Had a big butt and big titties too
So I hopped in her ass like Kangaroo
See I met this woman from Hawaii
Stuck it in her ass and she said "AIEE"
Lips was breakfast, pussy was lunch
Then her titties busted open with Hawaiian Punch
I met Colonel Sanders wife in the state of Kentucky
She said I'd fry some chicken if you'd just fuck me
I came in her mouth, it was a crisis
I gave her my secret blend of Herbs' n' Spices

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
I met Dolly Parton in Tennessee
Her titties were filled with Hennessy
That country music really drove me crazy
But I rode that ass and said yes Miss Daisy
Met this lady in Oklahoma
Put that pussy in a coma
Met this lady in Michigan
I can't wait 'til I fuck that bitch again
Met a real black girl down in South Carolina
Fucked her until she turned into a white albino
Fucked this hooker in Iowa
I fucked her on credit, so I owe her
Fucked this girl down in Georgia
Came in her mouth, man I thought I told ya
Met this beautiful sexy ho
She just ran across the border of Mexico
Fine young thing said her name's Maria
I wrapped her up just like a hot tortilla
I wanna get married but I can't afford it
I know I'm'a cry when she get deported

[Hook]

[Verse 4:]
Have you ever went over a girl's house to fuck
But the pussy just ain't no good
I mean you gettin' upset because you can't get her wet
Plus you in the wrong neighborhood
So you try to play it off and eat the pussy
But it take her so long to cum
Then a dude walk in, that's her big boyfriend
And he asks you where you from
So you wipe your mouth and you try to explain
You start talking real fast
But he already mad cause you fucking his woman
So he start beating on you ass
Now your clothes all muddy
Your nose all bloody
Your dick was hard but now it's soft
You thought you had a girl to rock your world
Now you still gotta go jack off

[Hook][Intro]
Wait a minute, man!
Hey check this out, man
There was this blind man, right?
He was feelin' his way down the street with a stick
He walked past this fish market
He stopped, he took a deep breath, he said:
"*Snfffffff* Whoooo! Good morning, ladies!"
You like that shit, man?
Hey man, I got a gang of that shit, man!
Hey, I'll tell you what
My man on the guitar
Fool on the drums
And hey, hey if everybody crowd around the mic
I'll tell you all these motherfuckin' jokes I got
First I'm gonna start off like that, hey help me sing it, homeboy!

[Hook][Hook: 2x]
Don't grab my keys when the party's over
I drive better drunk than you do sober

[Verse 1]
I don't know what you've been told
I've been drinkin since 12 years old
Started in 1988
Hanging at the liquor store real real late
I drunk a swallow, I drunk a cup
Drunk the bottle, I threw up
Over the years, I learned to pace it
Get kinda tipsy, but not that wasted
I like beer, but I love malt liquor
Cuz malt liquor, get me drunk quicker
Stop on the freeway, take a whiz
Hop in my Cadillac and handle my biz
I drive better drunk than I do sober
Cuz when I'm sober right
I think I can make through the, red light
Go, go, go, I hope I'm not dead right
But when I'm drunk, I know I can't
So I ain't, I drive like a saint
Drinkin is a class I did not flunk
I'm a Colt 45 certified drunk

[Hook: 2x]

[Verse 2]
I dropped outta school in 9-0
Became the world's greatest wino
I drink at home, I drink at work
Ignore the boss, he just a jerk
I drink 12:00 in the day
Relax my nerve, serve my yay'
When my day go bad, I always drink
Calm down, relax and think
Only days we like to clown
A 24-ounce 'fore the sun go down
On weekends, that's when it's cool
To drink a 40-ounce, and act a fool
Once I get into that zone
I leave that beer and that liquor alone
I can barely walk, I can barely talk
But I can glide that Cadillac like a hawk

[Hook: 2x]

[Verse 3]
I ran from the cops in the rain
With my church shoes on
I drove from Palmdale, California to Compton
Drunk two 40-ounces, Old English 800, the club ended
All the homies left my in the parkin lot toe' back
Wasn't nobody out there but me and the sheriff department
Fell asleep on the 14
Woke up on the 405
Fell asleep on the 405
Woke up on the 105
Fell asleep on the 105
Woke up in bed
Call that, uh, autopilot
But don't try that at home; I got skills
I am to liquor, what the Crocodile Hunter is to alligators
"These crocs, they're not your ordinary crocs
"You gotta grab them in the mandible"
We can't find no hotels man (you know what I'm sayin)
So we might have to drive
All day, and all night
I got some music
So it's alright

[Repeat 4x]
All day, and all night
I got some music
It's alright

Make you feel good
Rollin through the hood
With your windows down
Checkin out your sounds
Just lend me a light
No stress and strive, baby[Afroman singing]
Memories, of the ghetto
Getting drunk, getting high, getting faded (ghetto memories)
Memories, of the ghetto
Getting paid, getting laid and incarcerated (ghetto memories)

[Afroman rapping]
I hop out my car and stroll brother
Afroman, young soul brother
Late night crack house deep off in the hood
We kick it outside cause the weather feel good
Stereo bumping in the living room
Classic soul music with the peaceful boom (boom)
Colt 45 got your boy on buzz
But I ain't going home, I'm post in cuz (post in cuz)
Take another swig, take another hit
Talk to my man about some real deep shit
Cluck heads walking up and down the block (ba-kaa!)
Pulling to the side and selling the rock
The block get slow about a quarter to four
Spotlight po-po gets searched once more
They searched me from the east, west, north and south
I relaxed cause I got the cocaine in my mouth
They take the handcuffs off and we get released
Hop in the Cadillac and tell my homeboys 'peace'
Nineteen ninety-two Fleetwood Grove
Daytons gold in chrome on my way back home (memories)

[Afroman singing]
Memories, of the ghetto
Getting drunk, getting high, getting faded (ghetto memories)
Memories, of the ghetto
Getting paid, getting laid and incarcerated (ghetto memories)

[Afroman rapping]
My system be good off in my Fleetwood
Beating in my Caddy like cops in Cincinnati
At the red light, I stop and stall
Look at the liquor store and see my name on the wall
Hookers on the corner trying to make a sale
Brothers in handcuffs going to jail
The light turn green and I starts to bail
Dosing off cause I' drunk, high, sleepy as hell
And as I ride, I just can't hide
My sense of pride, for where I reside
I' proud of the ghetto, proud to survive the ghetto
You know, stay alive in the ghetto
Drink Colt 45 in the ghetto
Struggle and strive to get out the ghetto
I' out the ghetto
But the ghetto is inside me
Ghetto memories

[Afroman singing]
Memories (baby), of the ghetto
Getting drunk, getting high, getting faded (ghetto memories)
Memories, of the ghetto
Getting paid, getting laid and incarcerated (ghetto memories)
Memories, of the ghetto
Getting drunk, getting high, getting faded (ghetto memories)
Memories, of the ghetto
Getting paid, getting laid and incarcerated (ghetto memories)"Is night shift okay with you?"
"Yes."
"Hey well you got yourself a job, homie"

[Verse 1]
Graveyard shift ain't never dead
We go to work when people go to bed
We got a tremendous work overload
The boss don't care about the dress code
So if your hair's messed up, come on in
Nobody don't care 3 o'clock in the mornin'
I'm fantasizin' about a six fo'
Broke as hell, moppin' the flo'
I don't know but I gots the hunch (what's that?)
That it's almost time for lunch
Smokin' cigarettes in the parkin' lot
All the homies tellin' lies 'bout the women they got
Nobody gets offended at a racial joke (why?)
Everybody's laughin', tryin' to stay woke (yeah)
We takin' it easy though times are hard
Pullin' practical jokes on the security guard
And if you come late, the boss won't boot ya
Standin' 'round, talkin' 'bout the future
Don't even trip if you feel tired
Take a little nap, you won't get fired
Drink a little beer (beer), smoke you a spliff (spliff)
Nobody cares on the graveyard shift (uh, yeah, yeah uh, uh)
{*mouth scratches a chicken cluck*}

[Hook]
Paaaaaaaaarty (yeah!) on the graveyard shift (paaarty)
Paaaaaaaaarty (oh yeah! alright now) on the graveyard shift
(you don't have to slave)
You don't have to slave too hard (oh!) on the grave-aveyard

[Verse 2]
Hey, yeah, uh
My name is Joseph Foreman, they call me 'Fro (cuz)
I worked at the neighborhood grocery store
We actin' crazy like a bunch of kids
Playin' frisbee with the trash can lids
When the bossman comes, baby we don't run
He's a fool like us just tryin' to have fun
Graveyard shift is a little bit prouder
Play the radio just a little bit louder
DJ playin' that midnight mix (mix)
Dance contest on isle number six (six)
Bumpin' that old school Too $hort rhyme (uh)
Got the homeboys in a Soul Train line
If you wanna act crazy, go ahead and be wild
If you wanna rap, go ahead and freestyle
Graveyard shift, you just can't beat it
If you get hungry, grab something and eat it (haha)
Drinkin' in the back with my home girl (yeah)
The beer's on the house from the Corporate World
Act like a fool 'til the break of dawn
Yellin' curse words on the intercom
Drag racin' with the fork lift
Nobody cares on the graveyard shift
(you know what I'm sayin', ha!)

[Hook]
Paaaaaaaaarty (yeah!) on the graveyard shift (everyday)
Paaaaaaaaarty (alright! yeah!) on the graveyard shift
(you don't have to slave, oh yeah!)
You don't have to slave too hard on the grave-aveyard
(break it down, fellas) ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh

[Verse 3]
I never would work on daytime (daytime)
Graveyard shift is my play time (playtime)
Daytime jobs are flaky (flaky)
Daytime jobs are shaky like (what?) Jello Gelatin (gelatin)
So I work graveyard shift like a skeleton (yeah)
An afro-classic is what I am
I drive to work without a traffic jam
Everybody on the graveyard is like my brother
Always lookin' out for each other
Speak up fo' ya like I lawyer
If you come late, we'll punch the clock fo' ya
We gots no money but we got pride
If you car break down I'll give you a ride
Cause the Corporate World is oh so cold
To the people at the bottom of the totem pole
Divided we fall, together we stand
What you need? Get it from the Afroman
I'm not a thief but I got the hook up
For the barbeque ribs you wanna cook up
And if you need somebody to get drunk with
Call the homeboys from the graveyard shift
(Dedicated to all the blue collar workers
Strugglin', strivin', throbbin', thrivin')

[Hook]
Paaaaaaaaarty (if the boss lookin' for me)
On the graveyard shift (I'm in my car asleep, you know what I'm sayin')
Paaaaaaaaarty (hey so watch my back cuz)
On the graveyard shift (tap on the window or something, haha)
You don't have to slave too hard on the grave-aveyard
Ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh

[Verse 4]
Happiness is hard to find
Happiness is a state of mind
It can't be found in fame or wealth
It's found real deep inside yourself
Brothers, stop singin' the blues
Throw parties and barbeques
Don't destroy your life, enjoy your life
Play with your kids and make love to your wife
Drink a little beer, don't smoke no crack
Have a good time before Christ comes back
Keep your head high, keep your back stiff
I'll see you Sunday night for the graveyard shift

[Hook]
Paaaaaaaaarty on the graveyard shift
Paaaaaaaaarty on the graveyard shift
You don't have to slave too hard on the grave-aveyard
Ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh

[Outro]

Well, it's the hungry hustler, Afro Man
Rims and Vogues on the Astro Van
Money coming in like a Palmdale Pimp
Double-O G with a low key limp

Always stand to myself
Concentrate on my wealth
Greater than your highest expectation
I run the world, let alone the nation
Doing it every day
Looking good, making pay
Smoking the best
From the west
Palmdale High
Across my chest
It's lonely at the top
But I like it
It's a brew punch and spike it

Who make this money?
Me, that's who!
I'ma smoke more weed
And drink more brew!

[Hook]

All the girls
Gather 'round
When Afroman
Comes to town

Hugging me
Kissing me
Bugging me
Dissing me

I'm in dank dimension
Love female attention
I'm down to Earth
But I'm top notch
C-walk like hopscotch

Snap your fingers
Bob your head
Hit the blunt
Make your bread

Stay on top like the boy dog
Life is something to enjoy dog
Take it, baby
All the way
When I hear you moan
I feel okay

Climax--
Fire up a tree
Baby--
Hit the blunt with me

(A man it's funny cause I learnt this song when I was a little kid
When I went to visit my granddaddy down there in Mobile, Alabama
He stayed in this place called Trendy Garden you know what I'm sayin?
He used to grow his vegetables right there on the side of the house
And every now and then he'd get me to help him out know what I'm sayin?
And as he was like weedin out his garden and everything
He'd sing all kinda tunes and hymns know what I'm sayin?
And sometime he'd sing the same one like over and over and over again
You know what I'm sayin?
He'd get tired of singin the words
Sometimes he'd take a sip of his water outta that glass jar, set it back down
And while we was plantin them collard greens, he'd hum it
Just like this right here, help me out cuz, you know how we used to do it)

{*humming*}

It gets all in my hands
It gets all in my feet
It makes me wanna sing my song
To every little girl I meet
It gets all in my heart
It gets all in my sole
It comes straight out my mouth
And then I lose control
Cause I, I got this feelin, that everything's gonna be all right
Be all right
Be all right
Be all right[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning at the hotel
Rolled up a blunt got high as hell
Fucked another groupie name in my cell

Mama said it's better to give, than it is to receive
Afro went to church and said "I believe"
Universal loved Afro when he was on top
But when he became a Christian, that's when he got dropped
But Jesus would comfort Afro when he prayed
Jesus said "Don't worry bout that money
People download your music off the internet anyway"
Jesus said

[Hook]
And oh yeah, life goes on
Long after corrupt record companies go bankrupt
Oh yeah, I said life goes on
Long after corrupt record companies go bankrupt

Punk might give me strike number three
Cause when I'm drunk and when I'm high
I don't give a damn bout a DUI
Let's just get lit
Dance like a nitwit
Try to talk to the women that we can't get with
Me and my staff make everybody laugh

Let's get drunk together

[Hook]

Bacardi, Colt .45
Let's party we still alive
Tomorrow brings pain and sorrow
But tonight, we're all right
Drink that beer till your belly can't hold it
Tell the homeboys we fittin to get loaded
Rollin through the Ante-dope Valley out there
Hope the cops don't smell that beer on my breath
Cause if the sheriff
Catch a whiff
Of that fifth
It'll probably knock him stiff
Don't look dumb if my breath on hum
Stick your hand in you're pocket please, pass some gum
So the cops can't tell my breath smell

With the beautiful women and the beautiful weather
We can both get drunk together

[Hook]

Baby I beg your pardon
But your outfit's givin me a hardon
Maybe some way, maybe some how
You could dance with me, right here, right now
Been lookin at you all night long
That DJ's playin my favorite song
Everything's splendid, don't mean no harm
Don't get offended when I pull your arm
I ain't felt this good since I don't know when
And I might not feel this good again
It's Friday night, beautiful weather
Let's get drunk together

[Hook - 2X](Afroman talking)

Please take me back home (take a couple pounds of this weed)
To Mississippi
(You shmell me homeboy
Yeah, take them fools back to '82 cuz)

Before South Central, Palmdale flossin
I stayed in a place called Palmer's Crossing
Hattiesburg, Mississippi
Smokin marijuana like a Woodstock hippy
All my homies in Laurel
Beg borrow
Buy my rap tape tomorrow
Tell DJ Pumpkin "Keep it crunckin Clyde"
Request my tape when you go inside
So I can take Jane and girl
To Waynesboro
Fuck their little homegirl
Make her toes curl
Rock their world
Leave with their Auntie Sheryl
She sucks me sucks me
Fucks me fucks me
Cries every time I leave Biloxi
But I hops in the Coup
Cause I gots to go
Scoop another ho
From Tupelo
Hit it once hit it twice, then I hit it again
Hit it in Meridian
Make that bitch rub her clit again
Pinch the nipples on her tit again
Suck my dick until she spit again

[Hook]
Please take me back home (Hell yeah)
To Mississippi
Crooked letter crooked letter hump-back hump-back
Afroman's the bomb, bump that
Please take me back home (Hell yeah)
To Mississippi
From the delta to the coast
I'm doin the most
Grab your 40 ounce, let's toast

I sold rock cocaine down in Ellisville
Baseheads hit the pipe, they can tell it's real
Kept my dope stashed with this hoochie
Way down yonder in Eastabuchie
Cops be sweatin outta town dog
Sniffin my car with a hound dog
Separate me from my bitch and shit
Tryin to get my bitch to fuckin snitch and shit
Officer Roscoe P. Coltrane
Runnin warrant checks on the Afroman
But I can't be no hip hop star
Cuffed in the back of some police car
Did you find the gun? NO!
Did you find the dope? NO!
Open up the back door "Well son, you're free to go"
A-F-R-O marijuana cargo
Flossed like a cholow
In a clean low glow
Come on let's all get drunk tonight
I hope I don't fight with a punk tonight
Get nervous
As I swerve this
Cadillac through Purvis
Hope I don't crash when I hit Petal
Get my ass kicked in the white ghetto
Prejudice police won't let me go
So I'mma drive slow
Hide my fro
I was dumb, now I'm dumber y'all
Last summer y'all
I fucked all the little girls down in Sumrall
Grabbed my guitar and started pickin a tune
For Nikki and June
Down in Picayune, baby
Just like a shovel I be diggin
All the pretty young women in Wiggins
On the boat
Gulfport
I got my dick down some girl's throat
I can't help it I'm a Crip baby
I think you need to wipe your lip baby
Hula Hula Hula
The whole house ruler
What's up with all the bitches down in Pascagoula
Small towns, small cities
But they still got big ole asses plus titties
Is it a bird? Is it a plane?
It's the hungry hustler Afroman
Flyin through the air in my underwear
Geri curl activator in my hair
I'm in control like Janet when I hit Jackson
Always gettin plenty panty action
McClaine, even McComb
Tell the whole world Mississippi's your home
Yazoo, Columbia and Natchez
I got the weed brother, who got the matches?
Who got the funky DJ that scratches?
Depend on me like my name was patches
First it was a black thing, just the big Willies
Now I roll Phillies
With all the Hillbillies
Never ever thought I'd see the Klu Klux Klan
Buying front row seats for the Afroman
Confederate flags tobacco in their mouth
It's a beautiful thing jumpin off in the South
Afroman, I'm a part of it
Hattiesburg hip hop I'm the start of it
I'm the latest
I'm the greatest
And all you haters, I'll mash you like potatoes
I'll make your girlfriend holler and scream
Then cook me some cornbread and collard greens

[Hook]

1982, '83, '84
Erin, Broste, Carlos, and Tonto
Tryin to break dance in my B-Boy stance
Micheal Jackson glove, parachute pants
Calvin Gary, Garnett Jones
G-dog cuz, I don't believe we grown
But hey G-dog, you and me'll see dog
Whatever happens cuz, it's you and me dog
Or should I say loc
Cause you my folk
So let's take a toke
Till we croak
I'm a locsta locsta
Hundred spokesta
Drinking everyday like I'm supposed to
Bottle after bottle dog in my lip-a
Flowing on the mic like the Mississippi river

[Hook - 2X]Just like bums, we used to stay in the slums of LA by the way
Gang-bangers killin' each other for rep, sellin' rock cocaine on my doorstep
Had a ball to bounce plus a bike to ride, but my mama never would let me play outside
But when I got enrolled in elementary school, started bangin' like a fuckin' fool
So cool, throwin' up gang signs to the gangster beat, shot an enemy from across the street
Mama came home, said she got a good job. Daddy did too. Now they don't squab
Financially, we improvin'. 2 months later, son, we movin'
No more duckin' from shotgun shells. Bought a two-story house in East Palmdale
(give it to me now.)

Palmdale, come back to me
I need you and I love you, baby
Palmdale, come back to me
(Check it out, check it out, check it out.)

No more rats and no more roaches, livin' next door to football coaches
Now I got a new place to sell me crack. Now I got little white kids to jack
I stopped wearin' blue, wasn't trippin' on red. Too busy squabbin' with the skinheads
Stupid questions, distract the class. Rubbin' little white girls on the ass
I didn't really care if I passed or failed, I knew I was headed for the NFL
Until the playoff game, shoulder got hurt. I thought about my future, layin' in the dirt
I can't jump, I can't flinch. Superstar player, ridin' the bench
Graduate from school? Don't make me laugh. I got an F+ in basic math
(give it to me now.)

Palmdale, (Hell, yeah.) come back to me
I gotta do one song for my neighborhood. Bucccoooc!
Palmdale, come back to me
(check it out.)

I knew I couldn't make it in the white man's world, so I bought me some khakis and a Geri curl
I knew I couldn't make it to the NFL, so I went to East Palmdale and started slingin' yayo
For sure! I was makin' crazy dough. Should've dropped outta school a long time ago
Bought a cell phone, like a nut. Now I deliver like Pizza Hut
I drunk whisky and Bacardi. I sold dope to anybody
Me and my homies sold dubs and dimes, took turns bustin' rhymes just to pass the time
A white man drove up to my spot. He said, Hey, homeboy, what you got?
I put a fat rock inside his hand. About 25 sheriffs jumped out the van
(Get down, punk.)

Palmdale, (Hell, yeah) come back to me
I need you and I love you, baby
Palmdale, come back to me
(check it out, check it out, check it out.)

Can't get drunk. Can't get blunted. LA County, 95 hundred
Crips wanna take my All-stars. Bloods wanna eat my Snicker bars
Them peckerwoods don't want none, but the Mexican's straight own one
Them Ese's, catorces, treces always try to test me
So I jumped off the bed, cause I ain't no punk. Jammed his head up against the bunk
Socked that Cholo in his chin. Black mother-fuckers scared to jump in
Sheriff broke it up when we hit the floor. I kept talkin' shit cause I want some more
Back in town, we get along with the brown. Now I'm in jail, they tryin' to beat me down
Jail is hell, but I'll adapt. Won't hesitate to get in a scrap
Cause I'm down for mine, and that's for certain, sittin' in the hole with my knuckles hurtin'
(Palmdale)

Palmdale, (Hell, yeah.) come back to me
I need you and I love you, baby
Palmdale, come back to me
(check it out, homeboy.)

Now I got a fucked up life. Two bad kids and a naggin' wife
Dead end job at the airport. Check too short to pay the house note
Turn on the TV, then I see different homeboys that went to school with me
Playin' in the NFL. We used to kick back in East Palmdale
Rodney Williams. Lorenz Tate. Zeno plays for Colorado State
I wish my homeboys much success, but at the same time, I still get depressed
Walkin' through the wind with a cup full of gin thinkin' 'bout things that could've, would've, should've been
I wipe my tears, sip my beers, wish good luck to my peers
(Palmdale.)

Palmdale, come back to me
I need you and I love you, baby
Palmdale, come back to me
Cause that's where my heartache began, heartache began

Palmdale, come back to me
I need you and I love you, baby
Palmdale, come back to me
Cause that's where my heartache began, heartache began

Palmdale, come back to me
(Hey, all the homeboys on the football team, where y'all at?)
Palmdale, come back to me
(Hey, wherever you at in the world, I don't care if you in Japan, Africa
Hey, you know how we used to do it, man. Hey, hey, hey.)
Yo, let me get a Palm (Palm!)
Yo, let me get a Dale (Dale!)
Yo, what do we sell? (YELL!)
Yo, where we fittin' to go? (We fittin' to go back to jail!)
[X4]

Dale. Palmdale. (Hey, everybody just clap your hands.)
Dale. Palmdale. (C'mon, c'mon, c'mon. Buci-buci-bucccoooc!)
Dale. Palmdale
Dale. (Where them Falcons at?) Palmdale. (It ain't over 'til the fat man sings.)
Dale. (Little Rock can't get none. What, what?) Palmdale
Dale. Palmdale
