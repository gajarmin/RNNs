[Hook: Tish Hyman]
You're too bad, baby, I just had to tell you
You're too bad and now I wanna get familiar
You're too bad, oh, gotta get to know ya
You're too bad, yeah, girl, you're too bad

[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
Bet they never saw this comin'
Size 5'6" crop top and hip-huggers
Cinnamon Big Red MAC gloss, her lips covered
Couldn't tell you how I felt then, hope this does it
And when we out in public, got you blushin' and all that
Hook my homeboy up wit' ya cousin and all that
We can hop in my third whip and swerve shit, my turn
Aye, how many times you heard this? (You're too bad)
But you don't make me nervous
I take you somewhere phones ain't got service
Grab a twelve-pack, let me nail that
Aye, I can't even smell that
And I can tell that you treat your body well
Gon' give 'em hell, yeah
We pullin' up for real, Benz like Denzel, yep
Watchin' Mo' Better Blues from rooms with way better views
If we talkin' 'bout for you, then it ain't no better dude, feel me?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
Aye, and I never saw this comin'
Runnin' through twelve-pack magnums, them big rubbers
Now she wit' OPM, we can do big numbers
Her old boyfriend realizin' he did love her
I wake up every mornin' same time, like ten-somethin'
Do some push-ups, couple crunches to "Been Thuggin'"
Hit the studio, [lighter flick], and I spend somethin'
Buy a house first, then I'm a go get my wrist flooded
Cause money get niggas in the club, the list doesn't
I only wanna wear my own clothes like Ben Hundreds
And stay in big casinos, navy chinos
All weed, nigga, no premos, haha yeah
Still watchin' Mo' Better Blues
Stay in, order food, white robe, get her nude (Woo)
From rooms with way better views
If we talkin' 'bout for you, then it ain't no better dude, feel me?

[Hook][Intro]
Where you at, J Poundz?

[Verse 1]
I had passed on this beat when I first heard it
Now its murdered like the Inc., Irv Gotti never rode a Ducati
And if you pull up on me, do it fast make it sloppy
Told her both my parents black, but you can still call me papi

[Hook]
Ooh, I like that, ooh, I like that
Yeah, I like that, ooh, I like that

[Verse 2]
Ooh, this was always plan A, let me know what you tryin' to be
I'm the one they tryin' to see, give these girls all kind of D
Dope Dom and a Dollar Menu, I'll continue
Sold a thousand walk-up tickets in Diego, switch the venue
Rest in peace Tony Gwynn, I just see the field different
Had to flood the whole bracelet, man, this shit just feel different
My brother Larry told me, 'Yes', he comin' out to rep that West
Made it back to the hotel to wash my face and catch my breath
Another night at Mama Shelter watchin' movies by myself
Or I could go downstairs, find a cutie and get some help
I be saggin' on stage, damn, I should have just wore my belt
Tryin' to put them ice cubes on your leg and make it melt

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Do your thing, girl, go on, represent
Go on, represent, go on, go on represent
Told her, 'Do your thing girl', go on, represent
Go on, go on, represent, go on represent, ooh

[Verse 3]
Her Instagram blocked, it's feelin' like she not it
No matter what kind of car I'm in, I'm lookin' like the top pic
She told me, 'Let's go to the bridge, Dom, I want to watch this'
So I drove to pick her up the other day, she wasn't ready
Walkin' up to her room, only us, not a sound
Wrapped in a green towel, wipin' lotion all around
I used the whole bottle messin' with you, better know it
Lay down, I'll pour it, after that you better throw it

[Hook] (x2)

[Outro]
Go Ares, it's your birthday, all the Libras, it's your birthday
Go Taurus, it's your birthday, all them Cancers, It's your birthday
I said, 'Go Leos, it's your birthday'
All them Scorpios, it's your birthday
Go Pisces, it's your birthday, all them Virgos, it's your birthday
Go Aquarius, it's your birthday, all the Geminis, it's your birthday
Hey, Sagittarius, it's your birthday
All the Capricorn, it's your birthday, ooh[Pre-Hook]
Gon' pour this wine in your memory
Yeah, can I smoke this one for Phillip, please?
They say my nigga gone, but I think they lyin', I feel his energy

[Hook]
When I'm gone, just remember me
When I'm gone, just remember me
When I'm gone, just remember me

[Verse 1]
When I'm gone, gon' fill your glass up wit' Hennessy
This might be the last time you see a G
Might go get me a bodyguard
I might smoke the whole ninety yards
And leave the rest at your gravesite
So I never get stage fright
Wit' all these people comin' out for me
Forgive my words and you look out for me
And on the way home, I, I drove by my old school
I rolled me a tight joint, then popped me a cold boo

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
When I'm gone, I might just retire and move to Alhambra
Fuck my old lady 'til I need to use Viagra
Big nice cars, they'll make you drive faster
In the long run, what does it really matter?
So let that Remy be your remedy
Find a girl half-Philippine, the other half straight nigga
She got ass, then I ain't trippin'
She could be a white girl
Her momma have doubts in me
Her daughter's always at my show
Forget my words and she look out for me
Ha, and on the way home, I, we stopped off at Santa Cruz
I made me some new friends, then popped me a cold boo

[Pre-Hook]

[Outro]
I might just retire and move to Alhambra
Fuck my old lady, tell her I need to use Viagra
Big nice cars, they'll help you drive faster
But in the long run, what does it really matter? Uh[Intro]
Can't make no real decision based on emotion
You especially can't make no money
And I'm here to get paid

[Verse 1]
Sit with my son in the shade, sippin' lemonade
If that's his favorite, I'll buy it
I mix mine with iced tea, I let him try it
If I told you I have fo' million in the bank, I'd be lyin'
If I told you I was broke, you wouldn't believe me, anyways
So it's a good thing I'm not, takin' pictures in the fox
I remember when we used to be in here eatin' Whoppers
Rollin' five homies deep, mall security would stop us
'What ya'll up to? Ay, ya'll ain't shoppin', ya'll ain't workin'
Ya'll just makin' people nervous with them backpacks
Size thirty-eighty jeans, and you got your hat back'
That's another trademark, we was on the fast track
In the midst of growin' up, memories from, like, threesome
Through all the ups and downs
I always felt we was gon' be somethin'
At eighteen months old, through a smile, I see teeth comin'
Now all he wanna drink is lemonade

[Hook]
Good thing it don't take much to make that
It's a good thing it don't take much to make that
Water, sugar, lemon, squeeze
Water, sugar, lemon, squeeze
Water, sugar, lemon, squeeze, water, sugar, lemon

Water, sugar, lemon, squeeze
Water, sugar, lemon, squeeze
Water, sugar, lemon, squeeze, water, sugar, lemon

[Verse 2]
Just another Friday in the studio
Truck ain't ready yet, just got the text from Julio
Rydell Chevrolet in Northridge, yes, I did
'Aren't you Dom Kenne--?' 'Yeah, yes, I is'
And I might have never blew the charts out
But girls still rock my T-shirt with they hearts out
Ay, and you know what I mean, player
250 a pop, them A.P.C. jeans, player
Uh, I be shoppin', I ain't frontin'
I could buy you what you wanted with my backpack
Let me get my notepad, a pencil, or a pen
Leave me in the studio
I guarantee when you come in I'll be finished
Cause I probably got a ticket fuckin' parkin'
Hate quiet neighborhoods, I'm used to hearin' dogs barkin'
Kids runnin', now formula is no longer the formula
Cause all he wanna drink is lemonade

[Hook][Intro]
Fuck goin' on?

[Hook]
Aye, new day, same shit
When I'm down to a zip and my money don't flip
I'm hot, aye, but I tell you what I'm not
I ain't no quitter, motherfucker
Laugh now, but I want you to remember, motherfucker
I had a lot of diamonds dropped in that motherfucker
Two lobster tails, that's for dinner, motherfucker

[Bridge]
What the fuck is goin' on wit' this rap shit?
Look real funny, keep it real, do I chase the money?
Flows and shows turned into hoes and Os
A thousand dollars a day just on food and clothes

[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
And I had a application for the TSA
Now they say, 'Yeah, Dom K., he L.A.'
You could check my background and see the highlights
Twenty stories up, baby, get your mind right
I'm gettin' head on site, you just a bitter motherfucker
When the light hit, it look like Jigga, motherfucker
I'm from the West Coast where they hit up motherfuckers
Got me in the rap game gettin' rid of motherfuckers
What the fuck is goin' on with this rap shit?
Aye, what the fuck is goin' on with this rap shit?
Look, do these niggas want beef, do these niggas want peace?
All Eyez On Me, they tryna to get a motherfucker
Getting head while I drive, don't hit a motherfucker

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
Got three joints rolled, weed good
All the tickets sold, we good
Been rappin' ten years and you broke
Can't even buy a house in the hood, motherfucker
And I got my son, momma, in the CLA
Now they say, 'Yeah, Dom K., he L.A.'
You could check the highlights and see how we do it
Nike tracksuit, make them hoes jog to us
I'm gettin' head on sight, you just a bitter motherfucker
Walk across the street and get wit' a motherfucker
I'm from the West Coast where they hit up motherfuckers
Got me in the rap game gettin' rid of motherfuckers
What the fuck is goin' on with this rap shit?
Feel me? What the fuck is goin' on with this rap shit?
Ay, do these niggas want beef, do these niggas want peace?
All Eyez On Me, they tryin' to get a motherfucker
Getting head while I drive, don't hit a motherfucker

[Outro]
'Til it's over, this OP 'til it's over
OPM 'til it's over, it's OPM 'til it's over[Hook]
Things change when you grow up
Now everybody want to show up
Talkin' 'bout, 'I knew that you would blow up'
When I was young, my favorite song was 'Get money, get money' Weight of the world on my shoulder
But I'm still gettin' colder, so keep it real

[Verse 1]
Like, on a comedy about who run rap
Cause L.A. is on top now and who run that?
I've been all facts, I base my shit off that
But for sixty-five grand, y'all could switch my hat
To the Seahawks cause I'm always down for the money
And niggas always talkin' 'bout me when they strugglin'
I guess that's why my champagne always bubblin'
Two girls in the indoor pool out in London
At Dizzee Rascal flat, they say I’m a handsome cat
But all he do is rap, you want to hang out and relax?
Go shoppin' in Saks, hella bags in the back
And when I see her again, motherfucker, she next
I don't talk to her everyday, but we text
And when I throw that Biggie on, she don't even trip
I asked her to roll a joint and she don't even flinch
Dom K. is a pimp, you don't even need the blimp
I know you could tell I'm nasty, though my lyrics is classy
I'm not really that flashy, but I do like shrimp
Wit' some lemon butter sauce and a cold white Zinf
Somebody to talk to and share a view like this
Cause I been rollin' fashions, at least them attraction
Got dressed up for me, I do appreciate that, woah

[Hook]
Things change when you grow up
Now everybody want to show up
Talkin' 'bout, 'I knew that you would blow up'
When I was young, my favorite song was 'Get money, get money'
Birthdays was the worst days
Now we sip champagne when we thirsty
That's for real, and that's for real

Things change when you grow up
Now everybody want to show up
Talkin' 'bout, 'I knew that you would blow up'
When I was young, my favorite song was 'Get money, get money'
That's for real, and that's for real[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
She keep talking 'bout getting plastic surgery
I really hope she don't
And I wish I was the type that really enjoyed writing you notes
Video wit' Quik and Suga Free, but that wasn't no boat
Them yachts out in Newport, tell me, 'Who on your boat?'
While niggas lie about it, my soul girls cry about it
I'm not a member of Black Hippy, but I recognize higher power
You could eat pickles that's sour and sit in L.A. for hours
And you still wouldn't know what it felt like back in '91
And at 3:25, that's when my pops known to drive
Somebody said I should look for a house out in Oceanside
I'm from OPM, baby, got to get that straight
So you know it turn me on, I see her fix my plate
Told her, 'Look at the album cover if you ever miss my face'
I hope I'm on that shit like Eric B. and Rakim, sucker
Her mom said, 'Cut that song, uh, yeah, that is bumpin''
'Bout time you found somebody out here
That's really sayin' somethin'

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
I think I'm addicted to dippin' down Normandie
This could've been distributed by Priority
Instead we keepin' all the royalties
I stopped wearin' chains cause niggas' shit lookin' foily
And I heard what Chris Brown said, but I dick her down loyally
I have to interrupt, lookin' at your spoiled butt
Only raised by women, so you got waist and rhythms
To get my attention through a dashboard
Why you think little teenage boys always crash more?
Lookin' at the new 11s, thinkin' 'bout gettin' cash
Or waitin' on hoes to start shakin' that ass more
I’ve never been to Cannes, France, but i made movies on my black
L.A. New Era hat and Shawn Stussy
Aw, fuck it, I can't tell y'all shit, except, 'Get to it'
Gangsters used to wear nice shirts and drive big Buicks
Now this nigga on the Internet tryin' to pitch music
Nobody want to hear that shit[Intro]
Its 1:25 baby and guess what we up doing
Get money then you die my nigga
Ain't really that much to it
A lot of people have big plans
I’m just the one that stuck to it
A nigga tryna drive what Baby driving
Shit, I’m tryna do what Puffy doing
I feel like the guy in Crush Groove
My whole life is like Crush Groove

[Verse 1]
How things been since I left?
I know these niggas now have very little respect
That’s why I came back to get you up out that dress
And that was kinda direct but what else would you expect
You can buy cars, big condos and jets
Handguns and tecs, you’ll never get no respect
She walks in the room kisses me on the neck
Sits down on the couch like I’m tryna have sex
Two months later her stomach it feels upset
Took a pregnancy test shook her head and was yes
Never meant to happen hoping it turns for the best
Whatever the outcome I’m always gone have regrets
I am not Jody you are not no Yvette
‘Fore charges get pressed I’ma go head and step
If you getting money niggas gotta connect
And I never smoke stress or wanna fuck w my ex

[Hook]
It’s 1:25 baby (x4)

[Verse 2]
Excuse my language but I done been through some shit
One thing I knew is I never was finna quit
Build a foundation it take time to get rich
Instead of can tuna Ima fuck with this shrimp
Get a nice car hit it off with some tint
And every time I see my girl I hit her off with some rent
I talk to the kids hit em off with some sense
Don’t talk to police you might get somebody pinched
Never give a inch life can go in a flinch
Don’t say you got a gun when niggas know it’s a wrench
Hanging out with me feels like an event
And I hit it one time she said, “Yea, I’m convinced”
I know it’s getting late but I ain't feeling content
So I’ma pick this lock till I hear it go click
Tryna get my chips and stay away from you simps
If you happy being you I fuck with you on the strength

[Hook]
It’s 1:25 baby (x4)

[Outro]
You know, just living the way I was always meant to
Ain't no coincidence, you work hard, you get what you deserve then you die
The rest is up to you and how you spend it is up to you
Tomorrow ain't promised for none of us
That’s why we pop champagne today![Intro: Dom Kennedy]
Back when I was 17
Back when I was 17
Back when I was 17
Yeah...
Check

[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
Back when I was 17, I had a notion
That I would see the whole world across the ocean
My dad be workin' hard but he get no promotion
And he there every day, shit that's devotion
I never had a chance to be in the U.S. Open
I used to collect cans for them U.S. tokens
It's that time of the month? girl, we use that lotion
Before the president was black, shit I wasn't votin'
I used to believe a dollar bill was all I needed
Why you keep lookin' in the mirror if you not conceited?
Don't pack them Air Jordans, boy you not gone need em
On Burnside with my niggas, and them tacos screamin'

[Hook]
If I told you what I saw, you would not believe it
If I showed you how I ball, you would not believe it
If I told you what I make, you would not believe it
Look how niggas did Ma$e, I cannot believe it

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
I had the Craig Mack tape with that one single
Lotta niggas back then had one single
Tell her pop that ass trick and I'mma drop some singles
And real niggas fuck with Jodeci, not The Beatles
Lotta women in my phone, cause I'm ridin' chrome
West Side till I'm gone, Ima die alone
Never runnin' out of strong, I might buy a zone
Have her comin' home blown, smell like my cologne
Who you talkin' to nigga?, better watch yo tone
She used to call me every day, 'til you blocked my phone
I used to dream one day that I would shop in Rome
That ain't the life for me nigga, the block is home
Now I'm back with my people and I'm never leavin'
Don't do it for yo' self kid, it's better reasons
It get lonely at the top and its hella freezin'
I was here in '92 when it all fell to pieces

[Hook]
If I told you what I saw, you would not believe it
If I showed you how I ball, you would not believe it
If I told you what I make, you would not believe it
Shit we used to dub tapes, I cannot believe it

I cannot believe it
I cannot believe it
I cannot believe it
I cannot believe it

[Outro: Female Radio Host]
Latest news off the street. The OPM Boys made it to first
But the inside word is the odds have stacked against them
Be careful out there boys, real careful[Verse 1]
I be that nigga always wearing something clean for the groupies
Looking like Caine but nah this is a not a movie
Cell phones up, tell them girls to shoot me
All I hear is "yea bitch that's Dom can you excuse me"
Leimert Park legend, I used to bump that Snoopy
Had some iceberg and I used to want that Coogi
Back in 97 man my uncle wore the Gucci
And he rocked Polo, and he wore the Stussy
I am no marine but these niggas do salute me
Catch me on Pico, I am like the Lucy's
Give it to em raw, I am like the sushi
I hate how rappers use the term "fresh" so loosely
Bad ass nigga, I am like Boosie
But that just might have went over yo head like a kufi
If I was a DJ, I would be Brucie
Or any of them niggas Biggie shouted out on "Juicy"
Sometime I get chose, but you can say I'm choosy
And if you want to keep her then you should not introduce me
25th hour, that was introducing
Roll wit the winners girl cause I ain't into losing
Talking Crenshaw king, that's what we be cruising
Get my point across, so I never have to prove it
Squab wit a nigga, I ain't into shootin
This is not the army but them niggas is recruiting
Hardwood floors, but we don't be hooping
When them boxes touch touch down, then we gon' move it
Maybe out to Compton, just like St. Louis
Sugar 16's, nigga watch how I do this yeah I studied this game
I'm a student, but now everyday they call my name and I be truant
UCLA, I'm a bruin
And all them plans you made, I'm a ruin
Your whole rap career, it is ruined
And everybody say "damn Dom you shouldn't do it"
I'm the number one pick, that's Ewing
No one said I would make it, but somehow I always knew it
And I'm running this game, that's stupid
I write like Eric, yeah that's ruthless
These hoes so Ashanti, that's foolish
I'm good on the track, Carl Lewis
All these rap critics always asking for some new shit
Tell em go buy it and they never do shit
I fuck with FutureStreet, but dawg this my new shit
You say I'm bout to really B-L-O-W shit

[Hook x2]
In 1997, I wrote my first rhyme
"I wanna marry you" is what I told my first dime
Had my first drink, rolled my first dime
And I knew I was that nigga for the very first time

[Outro]
Said and I ain't never left, I tell em I ain't never left
Just tell em I ain't never left, tell em I ain't never left[Hook: Tish Hyman]
You're too bad, baby, I just had to tell you
You're too bad and now I wanna get familiar
You're too bad, oh, gotta get to know ya
You're too bad, yeah, girl, you're too bad

[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
Bet they never saw this comin'
Size 5'6" crop top and hip-huggers
Cinnamon Big Red MAC gloss, her lips covered
Couldn't tell you how I felt then, hope this does it
And when we out in public, got you blushin' and all that
Hook my homeboy up wit' ya cousin and all that
We can hop in my third whip and swerve shit, my turn
Aye, how many times you heard this? (You're too bad)
But you don't make me nervous
I take you somewhere phones ain't got service
Grab a twelve-pack, let me nail that
Aye, I can't even smell that
And I can tell that you treat your body well
Gon' give 'em hell, yeah
We pullin' up for real, Benz like Denzel, yep
Watchin' Mo' Better Blues from rooms with way better views
If we talkin' 'bout for you, then it ain't no better dude, feel me?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
Aye, and I never saw this comin'
Runnin' through twelve-pack magnums, them big rubbers
Now she wit' OPM, we can do big numbers
Her old boyfriend realizin' he did love her
I wake up every mornin' same time, like ten-somethin'
Do some push-ups, couple crunches to "Been Thuggin'"
Hit the studio, [lighter flick], and I spend somethin'
Buy a house first, then I'm a go get my wrist flooded

[Hook][Intro: Ty Dolla $ign]
Oh oh oh

[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
The girls all cling to me
After she took a shower I let her wear my Supreme hoodie
I'm fully paid, got a young face when I'm fully shaved (oh, oh, oh)
I like Griffey, my dad favorite would be Willie Mays
You get in the game be true to it
They say that I got a lot of hoes but I was used to it
Thinking 'bout her body and what I would do to it (oh, oh, oh)
Looking at the stars, getting head, I call that moonroof
She said "I can't fuck with you Dom cause you too stupid" (oh, oh, oh)
Used to love Death Row and I used to love Ruthless
Talking 'bout the Westside, right there on Crenshaw (oh, oh, oh)
Back in '93 everybody was from Lench Mob
Girls ain't groupies, most these niggas are (oh, oh, oh)
Stop buying Jordans, save up, you should get a car
Buy you a laptop, buy you a saxophone (oh, oh, oh)
I got a clean bed, me and you can get nasty on
She love it when I talk dirty
It's only 3:30 (oh, oh, oh)
I know you at work but can you come home early?
Just me and my bitch (oh, oh, oh)
And all she wanna do is hear me say some fly shit

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Like all the places, we can go
All the things, we can do
When it's just, me and you
We ain't worried 'bout tomorrow
Oh, oh, oh
We ain't worried 'bout tomorrow
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
And life's a bitch so I had to pimp it
I went from water with a lemon straight to lavish livin'
Fashion's trend: exchange numbers with the baddest women
I couldn't wear a suit and tie and get a average pension
Cause niggas like me would always have detention (oh, oh, oh)
But niggas like me always had ambitions
Of being free in this cold world (oh, oh, oh)
It's just a couple real niggas left and my homegirls
It's real shit right there (oh, oh, oh)
Watch my old videos, I still sit right there
Ran with my clique right there (oh, oh, oh)
First fist fight, I bust my lip right there
I'm just yo' chick type, yeah (oh, oh, oh)
She probably nod her head like "This my shit right here"
Now, I got my game from the Dogg Pound (oh, oh, oh)
So if she know me, then I probably took them draws down
I got 4 cars now (oh, oh, oh)
I took the 6-4 cause she like they way the car sound
Just me and my bitch (oh, oh, oh)
And all she wanna do is hear me say some fly shit

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Like all the places, we can go
All the things, we can do
When it's just, me and you
We ain't worried 'bout tomorrow
Oh, oh, oh
We ain't worried 'bout tomorrow
Oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh (x10)[Hook:]
I'm going two miles a hour so everybody sees me
Two miles a hour so everybody sees me
Two miles a hour so everybody sees me
Everybody sees me

Two miles a hour so everybody sees me
Two miles a hour so everybody sees me
Everybody sees me
Everybody sees me

[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
Rollin in this caddy ho looking like yo daddy ho
Say you from the wood but I know you from the valley though
Always got yo hand out man you know these cali hoes
My life is a video but you ain’t got no cameo
Call me the banana boat let me see your cantaloupe
Don't invite your homegirls them hoes look like antelopes
She want me to ram her though, right on the pia-a-no
I was like a-ah no, Fuck am I D'angelo?
Yes I a-a-am a pro, and I seen your bitch before
And she told me this before, Yes I a-am a ho
And I want to leave you but you just won't let me g-go
She want me to change her life, I got her a change of clothes
Million dollars ain't a lot, niggas just be aiming low
We eating good
Smokin great
Working hard
Gamin' hoes
Skypin' hoes
Chattin' hoes
Textin' hoes
Aiming hoes
Feeling's unexplainable, You know I hit things to go

[Hook:]

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T]
I'm talkin Slow downed, Screwed up, in a old school with a low tint
Bad broad, love to fuck, with her head down and her ass bent
No money spent, cruise the scene, put on game to pursue a dream
Don’t be fraternizing with these lame niggas, You need a king well I'm Akeem
Earth stood still when I dropped my top and I step my foot out the door
See the wonderful smell, and compliments on a pimp
And you wonder just how she chose
See I wasn't just riding high I was sittin' sky high I don't walk on feet, I soar
Y'all speedin' to fast with ya foot on the gas and 2 miles per hour on these hoes
Go 2 miles per hour and I roll, in an old school drop top
And keep the bass on bump jabbawockee in the trunk, my shit done pop locked
And I ain't trippin' on yours shawty don't get no burn if the broad ain't top notch
I'm above the rim with my chrome spinnin', yo clique just boxed out, I'm goin

[Hook:][Dom Kennedy]

Flowmasters, top down
Gold Daytonas, I ride around

(When we in my 5.0)

[Verse 1]
Swap Meet, Venice Beach
You looking broke, not me
I’m riding big, I’m shining big
I hit her phone, come by the crib
We in the pool, I slid it in
I slid it in, I slid it in
I take a quick shower then hit again
That fat chocolate ass is like m&m's
I got red hoes, I got yellow bones
This the yellow album, rocking yellow stones
OpM is the new Roc-A-Fella holmes
My niggas in DC be rocking hella foams
I get my grind on, in different time zones
Man, counting all this money got my mind gone
I feel like Derrick Rose, in the rarest clothes
$400 for the jeans, I bought two pair of those
Y’all be sharing hoes, we comparing hoes
I told her start working out; I’m just preparing hoes
For the limelight, get yo mind right
You still buying Louis bags, bitch you all hype
White, Black, Asian, fat, I got all types
As long as they riding we’ll be all right

[Hook]

[Conversations Intro]
Ok callers, we gone go ‘head and open up these phone lines
I need y’all to call in and let me know what y’all wanna hear tonight
If you with somebody, you want me to put something on, we gone do that for you
Right now what we gone do though, I’m a need everybody to call in
If you ain't got nobody we need everybody to describe they perfect person
And what would you say to that perfect person if given a chance
How important is conversation?

[Hook x2]
I need an interview; I’m tryna get down with you
I need an interview; I’m tryna get down with you
I need an interview; I’m tryna get down with you
Get down with you, get down with you

[Verse 2]
Yo, call Tisha phone
Play this while you sleep so you never really sleep alone
I’m keeping on to the break of dawn
If the pussy tight stopped at the light
Bagged your wife caught her looking twice
She said “yea Dom go head boy you looking right”
Know I got my stripes I could never live a rookie life
Still tryna get up in the nookie plus her cookies nice
She give me private shows and don’t have to pay the booking price
Tasha wanna give me 2 mil for the booking rights
If I lived in New York I’d probably be the Brooklyn type
Niggas from the hood don’t be acting all shook at night
Tattoo tears and niggas never even took a life
I swear to y'all niggas nowadays don’t be looking right
It's girls in the kitchen that don’t be cooking right
With so much drama from my old Bm
It’s kinda hard being from this fucking OpM
And that’s real

[Hook x2]
I need an interview; I’m tryna get down with you
I need an interview; I’m tryna get down with you
I need an interview; I’m tryna get down with you
Get down with you, get down with you

[Outro]
You know what I’m saying? Now look at me
Now look at me you know when I was little I used to hop in my dad’s
Back then they would have the little 325’s, you know stuff like that, them type of cars
You would hop in and be like man, look at the leather, look at the buttons
This is it, this is living it
That didn’t seem that long ago and now it’s like
My dad get in my car and man this is like being in a jet[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
If I make it to heaven
I hope they're still drinking brew
I hope I get to see Nick
Me and him have a few
Talk about '96
The shit that y'all never knew
When we was stealing Polos
Then wear it up to the school
Hell nah we wasn't broke
We just acted a fool
Shirt tucked into our jeans
We just thought it looked cool
You can say what you want
But that don't make it the truth
When its 91 outside
Bet it's 69 in my coupe
The A/C blowing strong
And we smoking that Ohh
Her homegirl is looking good
Yeah I was scoping that too
But I heard you got her pregnant
Thats whats up when y'all due?
Then somebody knocked on my door
Nick I'm hoping thats you

[Hook]
But that's a dream deferred
And they don't always come true
4 minutes 'til 4
The bus ride after school
If I make it to heaven
I hope it comes with a view
So I could see LA
Niggas know how I do
Fuck with me and get smoked
Or fuck with me and smoke too

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
Yellow Album so good
Niggas thought it was a fluke
Niggas thought I was on the juice
Yeah nigga it was the goose
And the bitches shaking they ass
I'm like, "damn what it do?"
She like, "damn can we fuck?"
Call me up and come through
Watch whatever you want
Champagne in there too
Niggas know what I sip
Tats on both of my wrists
"In Loving memory of hip hop"
I got that in '06
A nigga so West Coast
You can tell by my clique
You can tell how I dress
You can tell by my whip
Most LA niggas I know
Some no longer exist
And they got moms just like me
If I could grant them one wish

[Hook]
But that's a dream deferred
They don't always come true
4 minutes 'til 4
The bus ride after school
If I make it to heaven
I hope it comes with a view
So I could see LA
Neighbors and the Pirus
Fuck with me and get smoked
Or fuck with me and smoke too

[Bridge: Dom Kennedy]
Niggas know how I do
Bitches know how I do
If I make it to heaven
I hope it comes with a view
I gotta see LA
And keep an eye on y'all fools
A nigga is so West Coast
You can tell by my clique
You can tell how I dress
You can tell by my whip
The LA niggas I know
Some no longer exist
And they got moms just like me
If I could grant them one wish

[Hook]
But that's a dream deferred
They don't always come true
4 minutes 'til 4
The bus ride after school
If I make it to heaven
I hope it comes with a view
If I make it to heaven...yeah[Intro]
Spread love to the Eastside
Spread love to the Westside

[Hook]
Inglewood to Compton
South Central coming and
Love to the Eastside, but Watts is the motherland
Watts is the motherland [4x]
[2x]

[Story]
I wrote this um poem because
A couple weeks ago I went um down to Watts with my homeboy
And uh he had some of his friends with him they was coming or whatever to take pictures or whatever
And they was looking like um
They had never seen black people
You know what I'm saying and um
I realized that uh
If you scared of your own people then you scared of yourself
So I'm encouraging everybody to drive on down, get on the bus, take the train or whatever
Get on down to Watts
Peace to Glasses Malone and Jay Rock
Yup you know
[Hook to fade][Verse 1]
Hit me
We started off small from the ground up
Wasn't looking for the fame, but it found us
People ask "Dom what you chasing down?"
Hmm, take nine hundred thousand
And nigga, round up
Ain't never begged in my life
Nigga's hound us
Them boys pressin you? Shit
They always pound us
Ask my man in NY, how I sound brah?
He replied "Shit we know how you get down son"
I recognize a lame nigga when I'm around one
But I look like a clown try'na clown one
A new Coretta Scott King I think I found one
Man I'm through with y'all hoes I think I'll crown one
I been sitting on these bars
You can down one
I been leading the whole time
You been down one
I don't rap about the hood I come down like (gunshots)
Yeah I'm from round one

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I was just telling my moms
When I hear my songs I be feeling like Braun
No Corey Matthews, I be feeling like Sean
Yeah I finally got a job
Is you feelin that Mom?
My Dad asked me why I wasn't signed yet
I said obviously because you never rhymed yet
And my watch say "Nigga it ain't yo time yet"
I ain't have enough time to do Dom yet
But errbody ask my for an estimate
And wanna take my style, look I ain't even perfected it
I ain't even saying I'mma perfectionist
But at least let me pursue it on some Lexus shit
Cause I don't wanna be screwed on some Texas shit
Twenty years later saying I blew it on some reckless shit
The city locked up on some necklace shit
So if you got other plans, you should exit it
The game need niggas that's affectionate
Not just a bunch of niggas wantin' checks and shit
Not just a bunch of niggas wantin' sex and shit
Dissin the same niggas that they textin with
I'm textin a nigga girl like yo man suck
Meet me up at Autobahn, tell him get his hands up

[Hook]
I say Leimert Park What's cool
I say Leimert Park What's cool

[Verse 3]
Let me drop some math on em
Nah fuck that let me drop my ash on em
Put em in a room and turn the gas on em
Nobody saw a thing, put a mask on him
He a threat to the public put a task on him
When you going through his pockets put a stash on him
Shoot him one time but don't blast on him
Break a man's soul and put a cast on him
The game so cold so many snake brothers
We can't even realize who really take from us
From "Watermelon Sundae" to "I Hate Summers"
I got big self esteem, but I stay humble
I say Leimert Park was cool
They say Leimert Park was new
Maintainin, bunch of niggas complaining
For my birthday I bought me two Cuban chains and
I try to tell my boys that we more than entertainment
And I'm leaving with a different girl than I came with
And still and all we just this close
Waking up early so we don't miss this boat
I said still and all I'm just this close
I'm stayin up late so I don't miss this boat

And a uhh Leimert Park was cool
I say Leimert Park What's cool
I say Leimert Park What's cool
I say Leimert Park What's cool
I say Leimert Park What's cool
I say Leimert Park What's cool
I say Leimert Park What's cool
I say Leimert Park What's cool
I say Leimert Park What's cool was cool

Gon' pour this wine in your memory
Yeah, can I smoke this one for Phillip, please?
They say my nigga gone, but I think they lyin', I feel his energy

[Hook]
When I'm gone, just remember me
When I'm gone, just remember me
When I'm gone, just remember me

[Verse 1]
When I'm gone, gon' fill your glass up wit' Hennessy
This might be the last time you see a G
Might go get me a bodyguard
I might smoke the whole ninety yards
And leave the rest at your gravesite
So I never get stage fright
Wit' all these people comin' out for me
Forgive my words and you look out for me
And on the way home, I, I drove by my old school
I rolled me a tight joint, then popped me a cold boo

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
When I'm gone, I might just retire and move to Alhambra
Fuck my old lady 'til I need to use Viagra
Big nice cars, they'll make you drive faster
In the long run, what does it really matter?
So let that Remy be your remedy
Find a girl half-Philippine, the other half straight nigga
She got ass, then I ain't trippin'
She could be a white girl
Her momma have doubts in me
Her daughter's always at my show
Forget my words and she look out for me
Ha, and on the way home, I, we stopped off at Santa Cruz
I made me some new friends, then popped me a cold boo

[Pre-Hook]

[Outro]
I might just retire and move to Alhambra
Fuck my old lady, tell her I need to use Viagra
Big nice cars, they'll help you drive faster
But in the long run, what does it really matter? Uh[Hook]
Oh baby
Ooh baby

You're driving me crazy

You're driving me-

[Verse 1]
My LA show, it had sold well
I went home, no hotels
Phone's off, voicemails
No side hoes, just my homegirl
I be fucking up, calling old girls
We at Supperclub, they popping Spades
In Lamborghinis, still coppin' J's
Still smokin' weed, still rockin' chains
I'm in my Vans, I'm in my stance
I see her look, then do a dance
She see the man, I see the van
I can't go to sleep, I leave for France
Then fly to London, like Peter Pan
You don't need a drink, girl you need a man
Girl you need a plan

And when I talk, she ate it up
That's what I thought
Out of all girls, the ones I want
Stay at home, be at Starbucks
Out of all girls, the ones I want
At least 22, so don't card us
Out of all girls, the ones I want
If I couldn't rap, on the job hunt
Out of all girls, the ones I want
All the girls, that's what I want

[Hook]
Oh baby
Ooh baby
Oh baby
You're driving me crazy (crazy)

[Verse 2]
The DC show, it goes well
We on the bus, no hotel
With some fine hoes, don't tell
If you see my girl, don't tell
I love New Orleans, I'm sad when I'm leaving
I fuck with Ohio, It's ladies in Cleveland
Let's go to Detroit, let's shop for some pieces
Let's make it a weekend, get a place at the Seasons
Then wake up in Dallas, I'm checking my balance
Running these laps, eating these salads
Understanding my talent, gaining my balance
Looking for homes, to make it my palace
The best is my average

And when I talk, she ate it up
That's what I thought
Out of all girls, the ones I want
If I couldn't rap, on the job hunt
Out of all girls, the ones I want
Love rap, especially God's Son
Out of all girls, the ones I want
All the girls, that's what I want

[Hook]
Oh baby
Ooh baby
Oh baby
You're driving me crazy (crazy)

Uh, yeah, yeah, uh

Don't never turn fake, stay a soldier nigga
And its an OPM thing, 'til it's over nigga

And we grind all winter just to ball all spring

Sometimes we can play scrabble and drink Snapple juice
But I rather smoke with you baby and then fuuuck

Let that simmer down for you, im not nobody thats gone clown for you
I'mma make em put a mound on you, nigga I be all around town on you

[Hook]
Its a few things that I like, Beats Hoes and some Rhymes
I be zoned out, getting mine
What I'm worried bout shit is fine
Its a few things that I like, Beats Hoes and some Rhymes
In the two door through the night
I be zoned out living life

[Verse 2:Casey Veggies]
Dark shades in the party, ain't worried about nobody
Man that girl know she got it, I might get her nigga watch me
And I ain't just gone pull her, ima make that girl love me
But this world full of darkness im just trynna stay above it
I just need some inspiration, maybe some ventilation
Maybe I should stop racin' the hardest shit that im chasin'
Take it slow, slow and you use to letting it go
One thing that I learn is just a bunch of shit I dont know
I'm riding round town and I made a left at the store
Ran into a girl I know, got her new number fasho I said fasho, so
She heard a few of my songs and after that I proceed to run through a few of her thongs
I keep mental philosophies that I learned even at my home
Now I'm gone for the scrilla, mom on the phone let her know that i'll be home in December
Since I can remember I was on the grind so our home wouldn't be so cold in the winter
Till I get a whip with a chick with a grip and zip I can flip and a home I can lend her

[Hook]
Its a few things that I like, Beats Hoes and some Rhymes
I be zoned out, getting mine
What I'm worried bout shit is fine
Its a few things that I like, Beats Hoes and some Rhymes
In the two door through the night
I be zoned out living life

[Verse 3:Schoolboy Q]
Shit, shit, all I can do is me
Few coronas or blue moons and bet I got some weed
Top Dawg fuck a bitch scratch my balls and flee
Eat pills, now fufill your drills be all that you can be
Aw, place this product in ya bra stash, smash
Fuck the police as the lights flash, crash
Got away but shit it caught the dash
Turtle necks and long sleeves because my body tagged
So back to the beats cause I fucked up my lease
Rhymes increase release to the streets heat how you need
A gangsta thats sippin pink, need to see a shrink
Going insane im crazy, going ham in that pussy Miss Piggy
Dont eat it though Veggies, the cycle goes around a regulary, wait
Slide in the path a nigga dont phase me
Dos cuatro siete I keep my nueve

[Hook]
Its a few things that I like, Beats Hoes and some Rhymes
I be zoned out, getting mine
What I'm worried bout shit is fine
Its a few things that I like, Beats Hoes and some Rhymes
In the two door through the night
I be zoned out living life[Verse 1]
I'm in the game to win somethin'
She didn't wanna roll with me until she seen her friend comin'
Bought the BMW, you know I got the Benz comin'
Broke niggas always in the club but never spend nothin'
These broke hoes always talking 'bout you should spend somethin'
Got my first kiss in '89, yea I been thuggin'
Tryna write a song everyday cause the rent comin'
Kids see my car and they think it's 50 Cent comin'

[Hook]
Leimert Park nigga, never runnin' cause we been thuggin'
West side niggas never runnin' cause we been thuggin'
East side niggas never runnin' cause we been thuggin'
West side niggas never runnin' cause we been thuggin'

[Verse 2]
Ay, park my car up in the front and keep the shit runnin'
I fuck with you nigga, 100, we can get blunted
Me and my nigga Nip Hussle in the 600
How you gon' win if you never wanna risk nothin'
Get up off yo ass lil' nigga gon' get somethin'
I'm in the dice game, all bets, tryna hit somethin'
These hoes walk around in the club tryna kiss him
Not right now damn can't you see I'm with somethin'
Don't ever mess with sloppy hoes cause you can get somethin'
Niggas up early in the morning tryna get somethin'
If you put in on this weed then you can hit somethin'
Leimert Park nigga, never runnin' cause we been thuggin'

[Hook]
West side niggas never runnin' cause we been thuggin'
East side niggas never runnin' cause we been thuggin'
West side niggas never runnin' cause we been thuggin'
East side niggas never runnin' cause we been thuggin'

[Outro]
We been thuggin'
Been thuggin'
Been thuggin'
Been thuggin'[Intro]
Lookin' like me

[Verse 1]
It goes I know you got that roommate, she said we was too loud
But we couldn't quiet down, eventually she moved out
Hottest nigga in this shit, eventually I cooled down
Leimert Park I love you though potentially I'll move out
San Diego lookin' good, maybe I should move south?
Next to Shawn Merriman and do it like a married man
Be with one girl [can you do it?] yes I very can
But I just ain't that selfish so I share it with a pair of them
Keep at least twenty cents, niggas want their change back
Always been a player but I'm never getting played back
Always been a cool nigga, you would say I'm laid back
But this where I belong and yes, nigga I done made that
Who do you belong to? Somebody better save that
I just wanna say I thank the lady that can raise that
If I had an Ashley I would always wear a Braves hat
And damn I love my hood but I would kick it where she stays at
Love the way she's shaped up, that's what I'm amazed at
Even Dodgers fans would say that that's a Willie Mays catch
If I had an Angela I would always wear a A's hat
Write her long letters like "I'm tryna bring them waves back"
Gettin' my Chicago on, tryna bring them waves back
Before I let you go, shit I'm tryna bring that Maze back
I was on the phone love, I'm tryna bring that phase back
Know you got a nigga girl but where you got his name at?
You ain't got it tatted on you, you can give that chain back
You can be a Kennedy, you'll never change your name back
I hit it, cum, hit it, cum, hit it, cum...came back
I'm tryna knock 'em all down, you should let me frame that
I would keep it for myself, you should let me name that
It's a ribbon in the sky for us, you should let me sing that
Unh...but I'm a need you to sing back
Money, hoes, and clothes I'm just tryna get my lane back
Westside resident, we tryna take that game back
So if they ask who's coming up, them niggas better name that
Bobby...just that Best After Bobby, yeah, yeah
And I'm probably with your ex now, 105 westbound
Tell her leave them heels on, you can pull the rest down
Top 5 chest down, that means she got stupid ass
Make me feel young again, that means I hit it super fast
My head off that 91, means I got super gas
Took her to the back room and hit it to some Luther jams
Unh...rollin' like Terry in some Supras fam
Had a bad bitch when you was hangin' with Mr. Cooper
Damn...and I don't mean to sound big headed
But when she goes down she says I'm big headed
I throw my rollie in the sky just cause BIG said it
I'm a end up mayor just like my nigga Mibbs did it
I'm tryna find a house to throw my kids in it
And they gon' need a whole episode of cribs in it
My chain gon' hang lower then that nigga Jibbs did it
All I'm missin' is some Jeezy ad-libs in this...
