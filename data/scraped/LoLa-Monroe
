[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
[Sledgren]
Sledro!
You've always been a fool man, but you're stupid for this one nigga

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
This is for my young niggas, this is for my paid niggas
This is for my wild niggas, this is for my gang members
This is for the ones that don't care 'bout bein' hood niggas
This is for them badasses, this is for them good niggas
This is for them fly niggas, this ain't for them broke niggas
This is for high niggas, roll one up and smoke, nigga
This is for them boss niggas that be gettin' paper
This is for them real niggas, this ain't for them fakers

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
This is for them Taylors (x16)
Yeah I got it, so I flaunt it
And I bought it cause I want it
Screamin' fuck a bitch nigga and a hater
This is for them

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
This is for them lil niggas that be goin' so hard
That be on they grind, know exactly where they post are
Tryin' to get they cheese, tryin' to get they pocket so large
This for niggas over-seas, this is for them dope boys
This is for them joint-smokers, this is for them gin-sippers
This ain't for no ho niggas, this ain't for no bitch niggas
This is for them rich niggas that be gettin' paper
All I do is ball, nigga, that's my human nature
This is for them niggas who know that they got strong pack
If it ain't strong, we don't blow that
If it ain't strong, it's gon' go back
Money so long, that shit throw-back
And my nigga, this shit paid for, I don't owe that
It's a movie dog, it's a Kodak
And I'm so gone, see you later
This ain't for y'all

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lola Monroe]
Monroe, Taylor Gang's .44, 4 dow' (door)
For dough, four more coupes then blow mo'
It's about to go down like a credit score
Your broke ass can't even use debit, whore
Versace decor from the bed to the floor
Have several seats or exit door
Pussy sweet, shoe mean
We ain't gettin' money, 'chu mean?
Whole time your pockets' tighter than a new weave
Fuck 'em, we gon' roll up like two sleeves
Taylor Gang, We down to bang
Y'all pussy weed blanks from failure range
They could never duplicate my Taylor frames
It's the Taylor ring, got a Taylor dame
For this cheese, oh snap
And focus on my headshots
And I ain't never loafin', you won't catch me with bread knots
Eenie, meenie, minie fuckin' mo
All these birds be goosin', so I be duckin' hoes
N-never had an issue givin' bitches my ass to kiss
Wiz told me get 'em so I'm comin' out blastin' bitch

[Hook]

[Outro: Amber Rose]
Hey baby, it's me
Um, I know you out there performin' right now, but
I just wanted to leave you a little message
To let you know how much I love you
And I miss you
And I wish you were home with me right now
But I'm so proud of you
And I'm so happy that you're doin' so well out there
I miss you baby, I miss you so much
I can't wait to see you
I love you, muah, bye[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Cash in the bag twirlin up hash
Blue in the count and I pour it out the mask
Weed on repeat up all night
Cash over sleep got hoes all type
Live and you burn, grind and you earn
Bitch I'm on fire, I sit and I burn
Stackin' up money flippin' it too
Y'all ain't heard me but theï»¿ Benjamin's do
I'm bouncin' through the club like Tigger
I'mma hit the dope, I'mma hit the liquor
Nigga get wrong I'mma hit a nigga
Take a nigga bitch home and I'mma hit her

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Reppin' TGOD
All these diamonds on me
Passin every joint that I roll to the ones that grindin' with me
Now that's Taylor, (Taylor, Taylor)
Homie that's Taylor, (Taylor, Taylor)
Reppin' TGOD

Passin every joint that I roll to the ones that grindin' with me
Now that's Taylor, (Taylor, Taylor)
Lil' Homie that's Taylor, (Taylor, Taylor)

[Verse 2: Lola Monroe]
Bitch I'm Taylored, ain't no ho cut from the same cloth
Realest, this money only thing fame brought
The crown ain't safe and I'm comin' for the spot
Snatchin' all wigs bitch I'm coming for the top
Put a run up on trip how I run up in the shots
Queen Roe, I don't see nothin' but the gwap

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
All my money I'mma get it soon as I get it I'mma spend it
Bought a new car soon as I whip this
Smokin' that marijuana in it
Takin' the value down but also taking a pound
And breakin' it smokin' it all to me ain't no savin' it
Fuck with them pods, no seeds or no shake in it

[Verse 4: Chevy Woods]
Uh, fuck these niggas they ain't really bout that
Look I know what these niggas these niggas all rap
What they know about nights that they never come back
But he two shot now shells all in the mac
On the top will never see none of that fall back

And we gettin' bake on anywhere the bread at

[Hook 2: Wiz Khalifa]

King los, king los, bow down, kiss a nigga rings ho
Been knocked down, hated on, bitch I still did my thing though [x2]
I thank the lord every breath I take
Every step I make, im going on for this song, nigga wishing thats my fate
Thats why I go go way too hard, they say I go go way too hard, go go way too hard

[Verse 1]
Yo, rap on shit nobody go hard, I dont need nobody
I body whole squads
I bury niggas on the dark side of the moon
Till the sun come up and throw a party on mars
Im outta this world outta my mind, stuck at the bottom thinking
How do I climb, how do I climb?, Fuck I sound to get up I turn this bitch upside down
Cause I get down to get up, sit down do sit ups
Sit up do push ups push ups to lay back
So I make money do cruches
So you hate my guts when I pull up the maybach
Honey said she ain't never seen a guy thorough
So I got it on strength like a bicep curl
Hopped out the pussy like I gotta murk it out
Sorry baby girl, itll never work out, get it?
Snapback, custom made fitted's
Shitted on ever spectator every critic midgets never seen one quite fly
You a pint size guy to a giant like I, digits
I throw them in the bank
Bitches planking on the dick like they throwing in the anchor, her, er, and you too
It ain't all about the rappers

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Theyll never make another me
I dont even need half of me to make another you
I'm coming for number one, so shitting on niggas is the only way you ever see me taking number two
Im back like vertabrae
Nigga stop fronting, you ain't even really got the guts for this
Better man up nigga, im a stand up nigga
Back rosa parks woulda got up for this, cause I get down to get up
Never put the pen down to give up
Now a nigga pin down the pin up it feel like I been up
And yall niggas stuggling so when I pull up I betta feel like a chin up
Down, then up, down again and im so nice I put down the pen
Think you wanna battle, you wanna say yes
Dont push up if you dont wanna play chess get it?
Wear air j's ever digit and im the rap game
Los destorying ever nigga dont knock on a door when ya boy in the kitchen probably mention
Im something and the rock ain't cooking
Ski mask in the booth hope the cops ain't looking
Tell me god ain't smiling nigga spot ain't took it
My pa staying proud these niggas stay lying
I was born in the jungle man these niggas ain't lions

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lola Monroe]
Queen Bossette cause I run shit, I stay dumb slick fly, tell a bum bitch bye

Last of the apes looking bitch
You're styled played out like manolo boots
We taking headshots welcome to the photoshoot

I'm Queen Roe, Queen Roe

[Hook][Intro: Lil Wayne]
Remix baby!

[Hook: Juicy J] (x2)
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
All these chicks popping pussies, I'm just popping bandz
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
These chicks clappin', and they ain't using hands

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Montana!
Bands a make her dance, 20's make her glance
50's make her flip, 100's make her give me head (head)
Cheeks clappin', she don't use no hands
All this pussy poppin', I'm just poppin' bands
I just pay the mortgage, I just pay the note
Hurricane Katrina, bitch you need a boat
Bitch you need to float, show me what your twerking with
20 bottles, 30 models, 40 burners bitch!

[Verse 2: Lola Monroe]
She like, "What the fuck is a dollar bill?"
Ass pound like Impala wheels
3 wheel motion, grippin grain
Fuck the motion just get the change
I don't know what you thinking man
I take your money and get the brain
Them other bitches ain't build the same
He say, "You can't be real who built your frame?"
Ever seen a stripper go right, left?
Make it really wanna go pipe, that
But you ain't really gonna like, that
She fuck your brain, no mic, check
Money, money, bet you brake it off
You see that ass, you see that cash, bet she take it off like..

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
I brought some bandz so won't you dance?
Do a stack, you on 2 hands
Another stack now that's 2 bandz
Brought a friend now that's 2 fans
Gettin' trippy now that's 2 Xans
Double that now that's 4 bandz
Juicy J, he got more bandz
Trappin' hard like Snowman
Smokin' loud, I know the grow man
Been gettin' money since a young nigga
But they respect me now cause I'm a grown man, ooh
Condo by the ocean, forgot my watch now that's a Rolex
Hit the strip club and spend more bread and spill champagne on her for head
Smokin' and sippin, I'm talkin' that rich shit hopin' that broke niggas listen
Shorty keep poppin' it, strippin, I got to reach into my pockets to keep tippin
Seen her with the team, that's my bandz chick
Got rich off the internet so it's safe to say that's my bandwidth

[Hook]

[Verse 4: B.o.B]
Bandz a make her dance
It'll get her wet, it'll make that ass go ham
It'll get her heels high for the sky
It'll make them 2 lips kiss the floor when she land, damn
That outta do it, if I'm with a bitch then she probably hood
Gin on the rocks, gon' off the kush
She gon' off the bean she in Mollywood
She dance for my bandz like it's homecoming
She ain't working gettin' money, she at home cuming
I stake the facts, I brake her back if I drop a grip like it's snow money
I see broke niggas watching, cause they ain't got no paint
It's a lot of niggas saving hoes but Bobby Ray can't
I say what's going broke, can y'all reminds us?
Lost in the money can't y'all finds us?
Tasha and Nicole sliddin' on a pole
Booty going dumb like Alzheimer
I say what's going broke please y'all remind us?
Self made niggas no co-sign us
Tasha and Nicole sliddin' down a pole
Booty going dumb like Alzheimer

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Juicy J]
Bank tellers, bad bitches, paid niggas, they love me
Stripper hoes, married women, I be whatever the bub be
Met a dancin chick named Porsche, with a stallion ass like a horse
In V.I.P, at KOD, I'm gettin' oral intercourse
Twerking for bandz, I be on xan
She gon' keep popping them racks on your hand
Juicy stay making it rain in the club
And I ain't leaving until that bitch flood
Rolling like it's nothing and I don't give a damn
I would say no to ratchet pussy but I just don't think I can
In the suite with a stripper sipping lean and tweakin'
Poppin' molly and that ass, watch her get freaky
Gotta get some brain man, see what she thinkin'
Shawty don't spit, she like to keep it
White girl on that oxy, I'm on Bombay in that KK
Got major bread like Mitt Romney
Fuck making it rain a tsunami

[Outro]
Bandz a make her dance[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Look nigga I can roll up some more weed
Or order 22 more bottles of Don P
My presidential Rolex shining, that's on Gs
The clothes that I got on are designers from overseas
I pulled up getting high, told the valet to hold my keys
Hopped out, walk in that motherfucker, bought everything that I seen
Niggas hating, bitches wishing they can get in position for some infiltration
Taylor Gang motherfucker, don't deal with no shape shift
Only real motherfuckers come up in my playlist
I keep it way too real to fuck with your fake shit
This the real right here, roll one up and face it

T-G-O-D
Getting high, rolling weed up for e'ryone to know me
T-G-O-D
In the club, popping bottles, blowing weed by the O-Z
T-G-O-D
And you know I'm getting cash cause I'm all about that paper

Give a fuck about a hater

[Verse 2: Lola Monroe]
T-G-O-D, peep the game from the floor seats
Here for my throne, put them bitches in the nosebleeds
(T-G-O-D), married to the money
Fornicating with the ballers and fuck a prenup like the Kobes
(T-G-O-D), educating hoes
On the what, where, hows of embodying a boss, see
Bitch I school sluts on the whats and the whos
And the guts and the shoes and how the body of a Porsche be
Now it's rock-a-bye bitches
Lights out when I'm rocking my vicious
Ass-to-weight ratio
Giuseppe shipped out in (?), rent on a (?)
(Oo-la-la-la) is the way that we rock when we doing our thing
(Oo-la-la-la) is the first class high that the Taylors bring
My circle, anti-square
Can't compare like a (?)
Ain't I there, sonning you hoes, I birth
None of you hoes have earned, none of you hoes have learned
Vicariously living through my shadows
Got them throwing more shade than a clouded out meadow
Living in a land called Lala, no Melo
Maserati sitting on lips all yellow
Smoked out interior like a cigarillo
Now these hoes wanna hang, leave them hanging like hello
(Ha ha ha ha ha) until my lifeless corpse in the depth of the Earth
Forever stay a real bitch and only fear God
When the Devil get to tempting me, I only hear God
And my struggles help build me, so endear eyes
Lauryn we'll forever love you, you'll forever fill hearts...
With Hip Hop

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Paper, paper, paper, I'm so fucking Taylor'd
Burning dope, getting ashes on the calculator
Big wads in my pockets, money barely bend
I'm so sincere riding in a Belly Benz
Hit the booty club, drinking Sapphire gin
Juicy J don't fuck with ratchet hoes, only 10s

[Hook]Chorus

Only do zeros when it's plus commas
Comma, comma, comma
The queen in this bitch, all my diamonds royal blue
Taylor Gang, only team I'm loyal to
Tell 'em bring the bottles out, bring the red bottoms out
Pointin' at the map, I just pick a island out
Best believe I'm outchea, broke bitches hidin' now
No, really, I'm what ya niggas fighting 'bout
Versace for the duffel, pardon if I'm a fool
But I'm a bad bitch, diamond-covered muzzle
And all you hating bitches always gonna struggle
I just do the Loubie stunt and cop a couple doubles
Motherfuck a bitch hatin', I'm getting too much money
When it gets cold, I take my bitches where it's sunny, ah

Dark red lipstick on

Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
We on one, 'bout to get right

[Verse 2: Azealia Banks]
These bitches don't know, got the Liz and escrow
They need to let it go, stop feelin' so special
Y'all bitches sophomores, I mastered the whole course
That whip is chauffeured, I'm flippin' out both doors
Dark skin slim bad bitch who so cute
Petite witch, some sweetness, some raunch too
My thesis, no pitos, yo, Monroe
You peep this, bitches lookin' for loopholes and weakness
Kill 'em on the constant, this the shit they ain't seen yet
Young, behind my mama, order brunch wit' the ski jet
Notice I'm a problem, bitches, they can't breathe yet
Trendsetter mama, sweat me much, my weave wet

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lola Monroe]
I'm like "eenie meenie minee mo"
Which one of y'all wanna get my bow?
Better hit that pole then hit that floor
My shit so potent, gotta hit that slow
You do that, I'll get that dough
I'll get king then check that ho
All these bitches scared, you could tell 'em that I said so
Beggin' for a yes, you could tell 'em that I said no
Saint Laurent on her lips, gold Rollie on her wrist
That ass thick enough for the whole wide world to kiss
Fuck tulips, I just put your two lips on my two lips
Let me show you how to do this
Motherfuck a bitch hatin', I'm gettin' too much money

Pull up in a Bentley
And he never, ever gonna stick
A dick up in me
These niggas be acting up
And y'all hoes need to get tough
See I'm in the ghost
And I'm backin' up
You hoes lame

Boy you fucking with a diva
I don't save these dog ass niggas
Who I look like, PETA?
Get to ya knees like when you're talking to Jesus
Gimme head, when you finish you can get your sneakers
Bye!
My heart Coal like Keyshia
I wouldn't give you a spoon
If you was having a seizure
Only fuck with you on my leisure
Open my legs and get my eggs?
Bitch, this ain't Easter!
I could take a ho man, trust me!
While you chasin' little boys like Sandusky
He trickin' dough, try to knock me off
He got a better chance trying to hit the powerball
Sweepstakes, for Pete sake
Like Diddy bitch, I just want cheesecake
Why you treat fuck niggas like a keepsake
When he call my phone, all he hear is
Please Wait..

[Hook:]

[Lola Monroe:]
How you acting up in the Acura?
My vernaculars speak in stamps only
I pass ports (passports) with them lands on me
This ass gotten (ascot) in France homie
Fuck boy, I mean fuck boys!
I got a boy best friend that fuck boys
And he told me bout the sneaky ones
That like it in the booty
So they turn and do the kiki
Doing anything for Loubies
See, these niggas, be acting up
And ya weak bitches still shacking up
I got deep dishes on that platinum
Land o' lay screaming, begging them
Dick ridin', this wrist brightin' this bitch bitin' and still hypin'
I spit lightnin', they despisin' but despitin' it's inticin'
I'm coming!
If the money was Atheist
I'd still get across (a cross)
Employ these bitches
I still been a boss
Pro!
My league never had a play for a late bitch rookie
And these niggas drier than a fake bitch pussy
A Cup of Rose Maybach chauffeured
I ain't hanging up shit
Unless the rack sold furs
And the black sewed hurr (hair)
I'm a black Nola

[Hook:][Hook: Carmen]
Iâve been all around the world and I, I, I, I
Never met a guy as quite as special as you are
But it feels like Iâm dreaming
So many options Iâve had
But those relationships went all bad
I said I wonât look back
But Iâm waiting, waiting

[Verse 1: Carmen]
Got me waiting patient, just for your love
Got me going crazy, when Iâm not in your arms
Feel your kiss
Feel your touch
All the above, make it yours
Feel my love
Feel my lust
Make it yours, make it yours

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Los]
Iâm talking black Tom Fords in a â74 Challenger
This is the allure, but never before caliber, I
Said she was Day and she said I was Night
So we had a picnic on the Moon
And she said I was bright
Iâm talking out-of-this-world shit
How did this girl get out of the projects
And making the projects the product of thorough shit?
Paris, Sunday
London, Monday
Walking tall, like Project Runway
The more I look in your eyes
The less trouble I see
When you let me H-town
Youâre SWV
You give me TLC
And it got me silly
Itâs a cold world, and if you left
Iâd be chilly

[Hook]
[Verse 3: Lola Monroe]
Black Tom Fords
[?] zipper
Boy got drive, like a four door pick-up
Flick up
Paparazzi  up on our penthouse doâ
Never could top, itâs like the penthouse floâ
Been around all around the world and I, I, I
Never met a nigga to match my fly
But you take the cake with meticulous taste
And you make the fake a ridiculous waste
âCause you the realest shit I ever had
And ainât a iller bitch, who hella bad
So Iâm your perfect fit, like a cork in a bottle
All we go is get it poppinâ, Full throttle

If your money lame that mean your pussy lame
And my clique Allstars, no rookie game
Versace couture, on my decor
Had to scream, rich bitch shit I buy galore
24 karats gold is how we going tally hoes
Keep them spinning like a mother fucking Merry Go
Queen Arrow, bring sorrow
Coffee colored Bugatti, a Queen borrowed
Starbucks, cars, trucks
My Queen sip ace, play your cards, slut
Hard top, soft top, that's a tough call
Hundred bottles of Ciroc, that's a Puff call (hello)
Body cold, heart cold
Fuck around and get my haters dipped in all gold

[Hook][Hook]

Flatscreen so big look like summer jam in my condo
Bitch Iâm a star I just stand up and stack shit

And all my bitches ball like Juwanna man
Hold up, bum bitches to the left
Somebody need to tell them dumb bitches to the back

[Bridge]
Band up (x8)
Now I might clean yo' man out, you and me we been different
You want a hand out, I hand out ass whippins
Okay, I OD, donât make me K.O. these bitches
Then go fuck some racks off on some K.O.D. bitches

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
From the projects to the Grammyâs
Fix my makeup in a Lamby, sonninâ bitches, no plan B
Ole free pussy ass bitches, make you fuck all of my dogs
Iâm the hardest bitch in rap, fuck off of my balls
Where the heck is my block at? Where the hell is my town at?
Who let all of these clowns in? Where the fuck is my crown at?
Backtrack, backtrack, I done went and had a baby on you niggas
So you know I got that snapback, snapback
Bum bitch, back back, lemme band up

[Bridge + Hook][Intro: Lil Wayne]
Remix baby!

[Hook: Juicy J] (x2)
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance

Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
These chicks clappin', and they ain't using hands

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Montana!
Bands a make her dance, 20's make her glance
50's make her flip, 100's make her give me head (head)
Cheeks clappin', she don't use no hands
All this pussy poppin', I'm just poppin' bands
I just pay the mortgage, I just pay the note
Hurricane Katrina, bitch you need a boat
Bitch you need to float, show me what your twerking with
20 bottles, 30 models, 40 burners bitch!

[Verse 2: Lola Monroe]
She like, "What the fuck is a dollar bill?"
Ass pound like Impala wheels
3 wheel motion, grippin grain
Fuck the motion just get the change
I don't know what you thinking man
I take your money and get the brain
Them other bitches ain't build the same
He say, "You can't be real who built your frame?"
Ever seen a stripper go right, left?
Make it really wanna go pipe, that
But you ain't really gonna like, that
She fuck your brain, no mic, check
Money, money, bet you brake it off
You see that ass, you see that cash, bet she take it off like..

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
I brought some bandz so won't you dance?
Do a stack, you on 2 hands
Another stack now that's 2 bandz
Brought a friend now that's 2 fans
Gettin' trippy now that's 2 Xans
Double that now that's 4 bandz
Juicy J, he got more bandz
Trappin' hard like Snowman
Smokin' loud, I know the grow man
Been gettin' money since a young nigga
But they respect me now cause I'm a grown man, ooh
Condo by the ocean, forgot my watch now that's a Rolex
Hit the strip club and spend more bread and spill champagne on her for head
Smokin' and sippin, I'm talkin' that rich shit hopin' that broke niggas listen
Shorty keep poppin' it, strippin, I got to reach into my pockets to keep tippin
Seen her with the team, that's my bandz chick
Got rich off the internet so it's safe to say that's my bandwidth

[Hook]

[Verse 4: B.o.B]
Bandz a make her dance
It'll get her wet, it'll make that ass go ham
It'll get her heels high for the sky
It'll make them 2 lips kiss the floor when she land, damn
That outta do it, if I'm with a bitch then she probably hood
Gin on the rocks, gon' off the kush
She gon' off the bean she in Mollywood
She dance for my bandz like it's homecoming
She ain't working gettin' money, she at home cuming
I stake the facts, I brake her back if I drop a grip like it's snow money
I see broke niggas watching, cause they ain't got no paint
It's a lot of niggas saving hoes but Bobby Ray can't
I say what's going broke, can y'all reminds us?
Lost in the money can't y'all finds us?
Tasha and Nicole sliddin' on a pole
Booty going dumb like Alzheimer
I say what's going broke please y'all remind us?
Self made niggas no co-sign us
Tasha and Nicole sliddin' down a pole
Booty going dumb like Alzheimer

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Juicy J]
Bank tellers, bad bitches, paid niggas, they love me
Stripper hoes, married women, I be whatever the bub be
Met a dancin chick named Porsche, with a stallion ass like a horse
In V.I.P, at KOD, I'm gettin' oral intercourse
Twerking for bandz, I be on xan
She gon' keep popping them racks on your hand
Juicy stay making it rain in the club
And I ain't leaving until that bitch flood
Rolling like it's nothing and I don't give a damn
I would say no to ratchet pussy but I just don't think I can
In the suite with a stripper sipping lean and tweakin'
Poppin' molly and that ass, watch her get freaky
Gotta get some brain man, see what she thinkin'
Shawty don't spit, she like to keep it
White girl on that oxy, I'm on Bombay in that KK
Got major bread like Mitt Romney
Fuck making it rain a tsunami

[Outro]
Bandz a make her dance[Intro: Juicy J]

[Hook]

All ready supreme ain't gotta gas me up
My pillow talk game so superior
So I leave the store with every different color fur
BURR! Gucci Mane said it best
He's like my infant, keep his mouth on my breast
I'm SHEEDA SHEEDA, the Nicki Diva
And it gets wetter than, Lake Geneva
And then we role play
I just won an Oscar
Genius brains like I graduated from Harvard
Full scholarship... here swallow this
Sex education class
Let's Experiment
We make the bedrock
And holler many sounds
I keep him at attention it never goes down

[Hook: Kandi]

[Toya Carter:]

It must be something bout my accent
Cause I say BABAY and niggas wanna pay a chick
Small waist, pretty face, and my booty round
Now he in my zone like a touch down
I don't need another friend, I need a team mate
With a big appetite eat the whole plate
Don't come around with that lyin I seen you before
You know damn well I got my own TV show (Yeah Baby)
Now that's some boss shit, I got my own everything
And I could put it down
Made him pull a hamstring

[Hook]

[Diamond:]

He UPS my pussy cause I'm on another planet
Got dammit she can't stand it
Cause he spoil me like he Santa
I make him ho... Ho... ho while we cruising in my phantom
He catching temper tantrums when he miss my fruit pebbles
So I sex him on the schedule just to make him feel special
I'm too spoiled and too royal (too royal)
So he spa's today and rub me down with oil
I came first he went last
It's Willie Wonka no hands
Baskin robin in demand
Still rocking no weeding ring

[Lola Luv:]
Okay he super fly
I just gotta tame em
Sit em down make him the shit, potty train em
I make him raise his hand, call me Ms. Monroe
I bless him like a reverend... I guess I run the show
I'm a front runner his ex a back rounder
All she do is throw shade like the MAC counter
American idol I'm shining now
They love to judge me
Sign me pound
Give em the diamond smell
I don't tell em shit
I replace bitches I'm on my Allen shit
It's like a melon split when I let em cut
He pop my fire hydrant then I wet him up

[Hook]

[Kandi:]
Come give me a Hersey kiss
Twist me up like licorice
Wipe my candle apple while I
Nibble on your dip stick
Every now and later you can be my sugar daddy
I let you break me off like a kit-kit-katty
Ooooooooooooo
You can chew on my big red while you try my lemon head
Don't stop
If I blow on your blow pop I can make your bedrock

[Hook][Hook]

In a sauna
Lemon mirange guts chrome doomies on the Chevy
Lemon head rollie stones fruity in the beze
Two nickel plated deseâs (desert eagles)
Call them bitches leziâs (lesbians)
When they lick and then they bust
And leave all you pussys messy (go)
Flyer than a helicopter propeller
We spinnin, takin off
Niggas hatin, bitches jealous
We winning, go take a loss

She said lets match and we riding

Deuce, deuce with the damier grip (work)

[Lola Monroe]
I still been drinkin the on low, hustling on the low
Acting on the low, catch a flight, fly back, im on the go
I be in for the check like nike i.d
How i dance around the border shit i might be ali
Likely i be out of reach of rookies
Need v.i.p suites and a beach to put me
Funny thinking that a speech can hook me
Rather count a million while you eat my pussy
(Queen) i handle these bitches
Being Mary Jane ass Scandalous bitches
Drop bands on these niggas
Tell em rub this pussy, I'll grant em three wishes
Big mamas, skip drama, get commas, grip lamas
In my right hand, only day ones never one night stands
Im put the ice band on your gold rollie
This could be us by you lyin like you dont know me
And you won't know me, if you keep on
Keep doing, your own shit, grown shit
Sincerely yours, the wrong bitch
To sleep on


[Mario]
This could be us but you playin


[Outro](King Los)
So you goin to the club tonight?, or nahh?[Verse 1: Lola Monroe]
Move back, I'm on ya, new black Madonna
You lack persona, you stacks up on a
Only do zeros when it's plus commas
Comma, comma, comma
The queen in this bitch, all my diamonds royal blue
Taylor Gang, only team I'm loyal to
Tell 'em bring the bottles out, bring the red bottoms out
Pointin' at the map, I just pick a island out
Best believe I'm outchea, broke bitches hidin' now
No, really, I'm what ya niggas fighting 'bout
Versace for the duffel, pardon if I'm a fool
But I'm a bad bitch, diamond-covered muzzle
And all you hating bitches always gonna struggle
I just do the Loubie stunt and cop a couple doubles
Motherfuck a bitch hatin', I'm getting too much money
When it gets cold, I take my bitches where it's sunny, ah

[Hook: Lola Monroe]
Dark red lipstick on
6 inch pumps, I'm about to do me tonight
Sitting on the passenger side
Let my best friend drive
We on one, 'bout to get right
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
We on one, 'bout to get right

[Verse 2: Azealia Banks]
These bitches don't know, got the Liz and escrow
They need to let it go, stop feelin' so special
Y'all bitches sophomores, I mastered the whole course
That whip is chauffeured, I'm flippin' out both doors
Dark skin slim bad bitch who so cute
Petite witch, some sweetness, some raunch too
My thesis, no pitos, yo, Monroe
You peep this, bitches lookin' for loopholes and weakness
Kill 'em on the constant, this the shit they ain't seen yet
Young, behind my mama, order brunch wit' the ski jet
Notice I'm a problem, bitches, they can't breathe yet
Trendsetter mama, sweat me much, my weave wet

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lola Monroe]
I'm like "eenie meenie minee mo"
Which one of y'all wanna get my bow?
Better hit that pole then hit that floor
My shit so potent, gotta hit that slow
You do that, I'll get that dough
I'll get king then check that ho
All these bitches scared, you could tell 'em that I said so
Beggin' for a yes, you could tell 'em that I said no
Saint Laurent on her lips, gold Rollie on her wrist
That ass thick enough for the whole wide world to kiss
Fuck tulips, I just put your two lips on my two lips
Let me show you how to do this
Motherfuck a bitch hatin', I'm gettin' too much money
When it get cold, I take my bitches where it's sunny, uh

[Hook] (x2)

[Outro: Lola Monroe]
We one on, bout to get right (x4)[Hook: Foo Fighters-Wiz Khalifa edit]

She took me to her castle
And I couldn't believe my eyes
She had so many devices
Everything that money could buy
She said sign your name on the dotted line
The lights went out and Lola started to grind

[Verse 1: Lola Monroe]

Where y'all bitches learn your manners
Bow down this is royalty
Soon to be empire, a dynasty,_______?
Royalty over riches
Business over bitches
__ ____? on the ends
So wash the dishes over ditches
Saved a couple broad
And made bitches, maid bitches
Went from green to green
With envy to shade switches
And the haters can't applaud you
They appalled by success
So dear suckers I vow to forever offend you
The lowest form of life
I could never commend you
Them condescending souls will never ascend through
So I pray for my enemies and only fear God
When Garfield call they'll have 'em prayin' dear God
Bitch I'm bossed up
Check the cash stack
They floss up
Get the stack back
What it cost, huh?
Doubleback that
Everybody wanna be somebody
But never been themselves
I'm beastin' bitches till I body what made 'em deceit themselves

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lola Monroe]

Y'all go make me fuck around and go and get brand new
I mean fuck it (fuck it) the couple brand new
My cash dun' flipped
Now the loop brand new
Buy Versace, Giussepe, _____? it
(can you?)
I be's on that Boss shit, Maybach, talk shit
That I don't gotta ask what the shoe cost shit
Awww shit made her put pussy for auction
Combatin' with my money should never have been a option
I spit in a padded room
My swag escape the mad house
My closet goin' schizo
I see why these bitches bad mouth
Me, in the contrast
You're nothin'(nothin', nothin'...)
___________?
You bluffin'
It's DC till the death of me
Where the fuck the referee
Got "Slip Knot" for these rookies
And some shirts that read "in memory"
Hah, I ain't a illa' bitch alive
They need a bow down when the realer bitch arrive

[Hook][Verse 1: Lola Monroe]
As I lay me down to sleep, I praying for all my frenemies
They praying for my downfall
Iâm praying for they ends to meet
I get it, I get it
They mad I really done did it
Fuck you
Now this song for all the suckers who said, âI ainât gonâ be shitâ
Now Iâm shittinâ on you busters
And pissinâ on all your dissinâ
You bitchinâ
Iâm in the kitchen
Iâm fixinâ up my next mission
Essential to my ambition, [?] from the ambition
Show for body opposition
Opposing any proposition
Need morticians for all this body bagginâ I been presuming to
My ambitions could build ruins that will ruin you
Assuming you
That I stop my shine
Stop my grind?
You outcho mind
I can fuel my time
And a bitch wonât stop tilâ itâs not my prime

[Hook]
You know I got to fly away
Because I canât stay here
Feel like a bird with no wings
But my dreams is so clear
So even if youâre far away
Someday youâll be near
âCause when I get my wings
We gonâ get the fuck up out of here
(Outta here, outta here, outta here, outta here)
We gonâ get the fuck up out of here
(Outta here, outta here, outta here, outta here)

[Verse 2]
Now these underachievers wanna underrate you
Ainât built for the game, but wanna play you
Niggas lines played out, like they wanna page you
Now your âOnce Upon A Timeâ bitches wanna fake too
They judge you as a ho, but they donât even know the half
Hating on your future, they donât even know your past
When your mother taught you love, but your father ainât know how to
Niggas took a shot, but you ainât never let it cloud you
Put the Lord over this money, but itâs business over bitches
Treated as the illest, I put sickness over bitches
Condition through the pressure, I ainât never tripping though
The pain turn into pleasure
Like a [?] sniffing coke
Falling down is how you grow
Stayinâ down is how you die
Rising from my downfalls
This right here, is how you fly

[Hook][Verse 1: Lola Monroe]
Pullinâ 4 wheelers out
Fuck they talkinâ bout?
I put my 4 killers out
They wonât chalk âem out
My bitches in the trap
They be silent in the hood
Might push your wig back
Got me pillinâ what you should
Woulda could should nigga
Wish you woulda coulda figured
Pussy automatic target
Wish you woulda pulled the trigger
Wide receivers for them keys
Them niggas still coppinâ Ochoâs
Columbiano though
Bitch we get it by the boatload
We squeeze it like a toupee
And he tie me like a two piece
It taste just like some Koolaid
Threw it back just like a bouquet
Iâm like ladi dadi dadi
But my stacks just took a potty
Money piling like a potty
Pockets poppinâ like a molly

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Gettinâ so much spending like thereâs nothing to it
Got it so I show it thatâs just how I do it
All this fucking money I been getting to itâ¦
[Lola Monroe]
All this fucking money I been getting to itâ¦
[Wiz Khalifa]
Get a hundred grand and I be runninâ through it
Pull that Panamera up I get into it
All this fucking money I been getting to itâ¦
[Lola Monroe]
All this fucking money I been getting to itâ¦

[Verse 2: Lola Monroe]
Okay, merkinâ with berkins
Bitches perpinâ Iâm kerkinâ
I put that work in this curtains
They conversinâ Iâm lurkinâ
Chickens cluckin' and pluckin'
Like they buckin' and duckin'
They be fuckin' and suckin'
Just to get them a buck (in)
I say my ?????????????????
But ????????????????????
From niggas with Bricksteen's ???
Enough to hit big screens
American Gangster, I felt them like cancer
And if you ain't got my cash I fuck around and bonk ya
The first young bitch to whip a Bentley through my city though
I was only 18, now the crib is worth a milli ho
I'll sick my dogs on you, bet you cough up the bread
All this money I've been getting bet I'd cut off your head

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Gettinâ so much spending like thereâs nothing to it
Got it so I show it thatâs just how I do it
All this fucking money I been getting to itâ¦

[Wiz Khalifa]
Get a hundred grand and I be runninâ through it
Pull that Panamera up I get into it
All this fucking money I been getting to itâ¦
[Lola Monroe]
All this fucking money I been getting to itâ¦Said it must be, cause a bitch up on the source
Mutha fucking right
We got the district on the source
Hold up
Smiles everytime my face is up in the source (man voice)
I hippied on Biggie, Panamera'd on the Porsche
Bang with the game get ya block pop off
I spit bitches swallow till they get locked jaw
I mirrored them figures, that pull statistics like triggers
I move simplistical niggas, I'm just the sickest bitches
Okay now hold up hold up
Fuck they mean I'm colder polar
Best believe my flow' show her, hold a stroller
Hauling ass out my lane, better ask about my slang
I got head shots for these tryna photo copy my frame
She know he know , we know that I fuck around and go Debo
When it smokey up in your ego
Better get all my shots no free-throw
And givenchy with a mojito
Easy for me though how bitches want my swag, I could easily go repo
And snatch my shit back in a black on black vest
Snack attack on that track, run a combat your whack raps
Niggas hotter than when I leave my perm in for to long
And I never gave a fuck about a niggas who on
I'm like one of them I'm my own bitch
Type bitches on rich, white dishes on wrist
Quit vicious, I dislike stitches
They fuck they nigga over cause they pussy at heart
Through you work that prove you bring that quarter back Bret Favre
I've been tryna get these niggas off me
Can't even stack your c-note so your figures off key
OG, at heart keep my shit low key
I just cop me a new royce the perpetual rolley
OD, these bitches fake out more than smokin' mirrors
And my clique read thru gags, so don't get the choking near us
Really though who the fuck illa?
I'll wait til the gang unleash the killa951 Mercury coupe
Pent house embellished with luxury views
And we ain't neva trippin what it cost us
You should come parlay with some bosses
PJ to NY for a Jean George brunch
Valentino for the pump with a Tom Ford clutch
He said gorgeous what yo name is
Youâre picture perfectly shining letâs frame this
Givinâ a vanguard i just stepped off
Maison martin margiela's line and just stack cards
If currencyâs a concern letâs adjust that thought that's where you go fetch type hoes that must lack bars
Blacked out Maybachs and all white suits
I like um laid back with ball type loot
Donât get it twisted, i ain't neva trippinâ doe
Iâm at Tiffanyâs for Breakfast sippin moâ

Gorgeous darling everything gorgeous
Flawless stones and two door Porsches

You are now in the presence of some bosses
Gorgeous x3
Everything gorgeous
Currently parlaying over currency
And itâs all looking gorgeous


Minks minks and more minks
Please send someone over to pour drinks
Cause been currently occupied with these Euros
While they occupations qualify these zeros
Itâs money power whole lot of respect
My whole attire whole lot of effects
On rejects who detect the G check then reflect like we slept let's reset and re-step
Gold plated staples for these million dollar contracts
Billion dollar cases you gonna need a smaller compact
Hanging on these hoes and i donât never call the palm back
My hustle be so historic that theyâll hang my dollars on plaques
Cavalli cavalli, embodied inside thee the watch be Bougatti zanotti this Notti
I ain't neva trippinâ though

This is for my young niggas, this is for my paid niggas
This is for my wild niggas, this is for my gang members
This is for the ones that don't care 'bout bein' hood niggas
This is for them badasses, this is for them good niggas
This is for them fly niggas, this ain't for them broke niggas
This is for high niggas, roll one up and smoke, nigga
This is for them boss niggas that be gettin' paper
This is for them real niggas, this ain't for them fakers

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
This is for them Taylors (x16)
Yeah I got it, so I flaunt it
And I bought it cause I want it
Screamin' fuck a bitch nigga and a hater
This is for them

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
This is for them lil niggas that be goin' so hard
That be on they grind, know exactly where they post are
Tryin' to get they cheese, tryin' to get they pocket so large
This for niggas over-seas, this is for them dope boys
This is for them joint-smokers, this is for them gin-sippers
This ain't for no ho niggas, this ain't for no bitch niggas
This is for them rich niggas that be gettin' paper
All I do is ball, nigga, that's my human nature
This is for them niggas who know that they got strong pack
If it ain't strong, we don't blow that
If it ain't strong, it's gon' go back
Money so long, that shit throw-back
And my nigga, this shit paid for, I don't owe that
It's a movie dog, it's a Kodak
And I'm so gone, see you later
This ain't for y'all

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lola Monroe]
Monroe, Taylor Gang's .44, 4 dow' (door)
For dough, four more coupes then blow mo'
It's about to go down like a credit score
Your broke ass can't even use debit, whore
Versace decor from the bed to the floor
Have several seats or exit door
Pussy sweet, shoe mean
We ain't gettin' money, 'chu mean?
Whole time your pockets' tighter than a new weave
Fuck 'em, we gon' roll up like two sleeves
Taylor Gang, We down to bang
Y'all pussy weed blanks from failure range
They could never duplicate my Taylor frames
It's the Taylor ring, got a Taylor dame
For this cheese, oh snap
And focus on my headshots
And I ain't never loafin', you won't catch me with bread knots
Eenie, meenie, minie fuckin' mo
All these birds be goosin', so I be duckin' hoes
N-never had an issue givin' bitches my ass to kiss
Wiz told me get 'em so I'm comin' out blastin' bitch

[Hook]

[Outro: Amber Rose]
Hey baby, it's me
Um, I know you out there performin' right now, but
I just wanted to leave you a little message
To let you know how much I love you
And I miss you
And I wish you were home with me right now
But I'm so proud of you
And I'm so happy that you're doin' so well out there
I miss you baby, I miss you so much
I can't wait to see you
I love you, muah, bye[Hook]
King los, king los, bow down, kiss a nigga rings ho
Been knocked down, hated on, bitch I still did my thing though [x2]
I thank the lord every breath I take
Every step I make, im going on for this song, nigga wishing thats my fate
Thats why I go go way too hard, they say I go go way too hard, go go way too hard

[Verse 1]
Yo, rap on shit nobody go hard, I dont need nobody
I body whole squads
I bury niggas on the dark side of the moon
Till the sun come up and throw a party on mars
Im outta this world outta my mind, stuck at the bottom thinking
How do I climb, how do I climb?, Fuck I sound to get up I turn this bitch upside down
Cause I get down to get up, sit down do sit ups
Sit up do push ups push ups to lay back
So I make money do cruches
So you hate my guts when I pull up the maybach
Honey said she ain't never seen a guy thorough
So I got it on strength like a bicep curl
Hopped out the pussy like I gotta murk it out
Sorry baby girl, itll never work out, get it?
Snapback, custom made fitted's
Shitted on ever spectator every critic midgets never seen one quite fly
You a pint size guy to a giant like I, digits
I throw them in the bank
Bitches planking on the dick like they throwing in the anchor, her, er, and you too
It ain't all about the rappers

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Theyll never make another me
I dont even need half of me to make another you
I'm coming for number one, so shitting on niggas is the only way you ever see me taking number two
Im back like vertabrae
Nigga stop fronting, you ain't even really got the guts for this
Better man up nigga, im a stand up nigga
Back rosa parks woulda got up for this, cause I get down to get up
Never put the pen down to give up
Now a nigga pin down the pin up it feel like I been up
And yall niggas stuggling so when I pull up I betta feel like a chin up
Down, then up, down again and im so nice I put down the pen
Think you wanna battle, you wanna say yes
Dont push up if you dont wanna play chess get it?
Wear air j's ever digit and im the rap game
Los destorying ever nigga dont knock on a door when ya boy in the kitchen probably mention
Im something and the rock ain't cooking
Ski mask in the booth hope the cops ain't looking
Tell me god ain't smiling nigga spot ain't took it
My pa staying proud these niggas stay lying
I was born in the jungle man these niggas ain't lions

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lola Monroe]
Queen Bossette cause I run shit, I stay dumb slick fly, tell a bum bitch bye
Wanna come trick, why, you ain't built like that
You gonna fuck and get killed like that
Ole back of the race looking bitch ole wack ass drag in the face looking bitch

Eat it from the back , got her on lock

Roll the weed up

So niggas gotta see us
Mackaveli, Mackaveli, Mackaveli

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
My niggas is killers they will run up in your spot
Word on the town is you been movin' them blocks
But we know the truth, you just a nigga that fly
Like to show out in public and lie to these broads
We makin' money nigga we don't lie to kick it
Got a room full of money bed full of bitches
And they all geeked up all love kissing
And if you call her on your phone she gon' tell you she busy
Out here, hatin' on a nigga wanna start beef
Man you're out here, on these streets like it's all sweet
They gon' get your ass, slip and they gon' call me
And I'm gon' tell em go ahead and put his ass to sleep

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lola Monroe]
Queen Roe for the record better go and get better
Soldier [?] like the letter
Cus mine leave clips in your head like barretas
Bitch so cold everybody's got a sweater
Prayin' hail mary all these eyes on me
But still I rise like resurrections demise on key
Thug life, thug life let me get this mug right
Fuck type your life when niggas cut white, raw
I don't dump no work she don't want that work I mean it bitch I ball
[?] and checks I'm banking bitch I call the shots
The clock you block, you shop and shop
My og taught me how to Al Capone a bitch for fun
So his boss said mafia my bitches pulled one

[Hook][Hook: Gangsta Boo] (x2)
I need a money mane (mane) (x4)
I need a nigga 'bout his business
Got money, gon' spend it
Go to sleep up in it and don't stop till he finish

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Whole box of that Bombay, fuck me and my posse
It's Juicy J, I'm a rich nigga
Ain't a lot to choose, can't copy
She came over clean and I left that bitch sloppy
High on that Actavis, a nigga, I stay glossy
Zan bars and molly, I be on designer
If you let your chick go, I swear that you won't find her
My diamonds gon' blind her, Louis V remind her
Big bags of that cash, blowing hoes who shaking ass
Everything I pay in cash, the Lambo going extra fast
And the passenger is extra bad
We flying in the whip and I'm smoking gas
That check ain't never gon' stop, that's why you extra mad

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I drop weight, that's how I get a load off
Pitbull in my passenger seat is my road dog
If your girl ride with me, she take her clothes off
I'm smoking on the strongest pack till I dose off
Me and Project Pat-ah, this the new chapter
All this fucking 'caine like a motherfucking cap-ah
And I'm from the A, I'm bout to bring it back-ah
Tip blocked the way and Ludacris is a actor
Burning like tobacco, southside trapper
Spell 'south' wit' a F, the 'F' stand for fuck-ah
And you know I did it, I do it, like, daily
Fuck wit' me, I'll show you how to turn a brick into a Bentley
Money, money man, ten hundred grand
Nigga, that's a mil, that pussy deep, quicksand (deep)
All up in that thang like "you it" when I do it
Chain so dumb, got yo' nigga looking stupid

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lola Monroe]
Why y'all niggas be loafing? Fuck is up with that bread?
I ain't the type to be open, 'less you talking that head
Pounds up in that trash bag, bricks up in that MCM
I ain't tripping off no bitch, straight life for it is 10 PM
Stick his tongue inside the box while he chop a eighth down
Fuck him, fuck him, knock him out in the eighth round
All white Lambi, call that bitch albino
I know, I know, it get wetter than a wino

[Verse 4: Project Pat]
I'm that nigga that ya looking for, clean, ho, forget the toes
Chandeliers in my ears and a pocket full of dough
Polo boots, Polo shirt, in demand like some purp
Ain't gon' bust a nut, baby girl, till that coochie squirt
All night on them pills, blowing weed, popping bottles
Pouring rosÃ© in your cup, baby, gon' take a swallow
I buy these hoes nice things, cooking candy rings
I sell 'em good dreams while they eating ding-a-ling

[Hook] (x2)
