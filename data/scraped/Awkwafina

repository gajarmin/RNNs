Bitches be in Bushwick, they all live in Bushwick
They all love Bushwick but I say "FUCK THAT SHIT"
Pull over by the Burg
Hipster pussy market
Feelin' on these vegans despite the smell of armpits
The skinny ones are artists, it's obvious they starving

Can I take a train there? No idea
Traffic on Atlantic, bitches stay alien
Yo peep that mess Jay-Z call a stadium
Uptown bro-fest, 20-something douchebags
"Let's get a pint bro, yo where the skanks at?"
East Village poppin', college kids coppin'
Drank too much now the IVs droppin'
West Fourth pizza, stop in front of Joe's
Chillin' with the lezzies outside of the Cubby Hole
Ave of the Americas, driving in the bike lane
Sloppy ass bitches coming out of the PATH train
Bitch, where your pants at? It's 25 degrees out
You eatin' nachos on the block with your pussy out
Queensbridge Projects, Long Island City
Forest motherfuckin' Hills, bitch, get shitty

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Awkwafina]
No I'm not from Flushing, I wonder why you think that
CitiField bitch where the overpriced drinks at

Blunts in the whip, now we got the munchies
I wonder if the corner store still sell loosies

[Hook]Faux thugging
Killa queens loving
You with that bitch look like Pooh Bear's cousin
Block hugging
Bitches liking danger
Saber Tooth Tiger
I'm a ma'fucking Yellow Ranger
And Awkwafina just a ratchet ho
Instagramming kitties, topping swag up on that FroYo
Deez make us out of space
Dollars never saving face
Roll up with these chicken heads
Acting like we own the place
Yo
And I bring that yellow to the rap game
High with these little eyes, Po can't tell if I'm blazed
Shout out to Greenpoint, Kielbasa in the oven
Greenpoint where all the bitches look like Lena Dunham but
Direct deposit that heat up in your inbox
9-to-5 office thighs, scanning on the xerox
But I got some time for a bagel and a muffin
Team, moving forward damn these bitches can't say nothing
But I got this all up on my LinkedIn
Proficient in spitting, turning red when I'm drinking
Emancipating pussy like I was Abe Lincoln
Squirting out that Kool-Aid til all these ratchets sinking, sinkingYo it’s that hot shrimp, in yo face, call that shit hibachi
I don’t even need words, koyaanisqatsi
When they come to skin, bitch I’m thick like congee
How I run the game with a dick like Fonzie

And all these chickens on me, Joanies on the Chachi
Hoes on a mission but they can’t afford the Caché
You know I’m tryna holler in a whip, so swampy
You know I’m tryna holler in that whip come stop me

Watch me
You know I’m tryna holler in that whip come stop me
Come stop me (X4)

I’m on that real time bill, more balling like the Romneys
Sweater game tight like I’m rolling with the Cosbys
Me and Awkwafina making bread like banh mi
If we have a baby then we namin’ it Dasani
Try me, (Come on, try me), here’s Johnny
New socks every day, fuck doing laundry
Chuck’s from swap league, cuffs from down key
Win some dime pieces, gettin’ drunk as my auntie

Watch me
You know I’m tryna holler in that whip come stop me
Come stop me (X4)[Hook]

Queefing lacks treble but the bass is turnt up man

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm F. Scott Queefsgerald

Queefing Han Solo
Queefy Wan Kenobi

Guarding my gold from the biters and the plagiarists
(Janet Reno) Guarding my gold from the biters and the plagiarists
And then I was eating bacon mac and cheezus
Nice at rollin' blunts because I’m good at folding creases
KCF ain't like me cause I didn’t find Jesus
But I still got freshman Friday
From them scary ass Korean girls
Now I’m showing up at yet another brunch shitshow
Then I shop for things I can’t afford like a millennial
Going home, getting stoned, staring at my mac book

Janet Reno mad cause I shot her in my rap hooks
Whaddup shawty
I stay gettin' cake

(chorus)

[Verse 2: Awkwafina]

Look dad I passed bar, SATS, LSATS
I know you disapproved of my relationship with rap but
That’s still leavin’ me broke
But at the very least not sad
There's a bunch of other shit I could be doing that involves vag
Walled up farmer, areola model, cat or dog walker, reverend Al Sharpton
Cause I believe in karma

Come stop me (X4)Kevin Bacon, why you hatin'?
I just want to make our bodies adjacent
In the back seat of a Subaru
Wine'ing and dining at the Tellers' barbecue

And you can act out scenes from the Hollow Man
I could get Footloose all up in my Neverland
Fuck Neve Campbell and Denise Richards
Though you can throw Matt Dillon into the picture

I'm day dreaming 'bout a man like that
What I would do with a man like that?
Yo, I'm day dreaming 'bout a man like that
What I would do with a man like that?

Chris Christie, you a man beast
I love it when you yelling at me on the TV
With yo white shirt,  is that a taco stain?
I'll give you cookies if you promise that I'll get laid

Bitch show me the world, or just Jersey
We could make Kleenex so dirty
And I don't blame you, for the Bridgegate
Cause you are still the governor of my mid-range

I'm day dreaming 'bout a man like that
What I would do with a man like that?
Yo, I'm day dreaming 'bout a man like that
What I would do with a man like that?

Yo Sinbad, where you been at?
I wrote you messages I even sent a sext fax
I want to hold you in a hot tub
Tell you my fears while you givin' me a back rub

I wouldn't throw a fit, if you was my house guest
Just know that I will put that D on house arrest
In a different world, we will be lovers
We could have a foursome with Urkel and Sally Struthers

I'm day dreaming 'bout a man like that
What I would do with a man like that?
Yo, I'm day dreaming 'bout a man like that
What I would do with a man like that?Verse 1:
Ayo today I woke up and looked at my calendar
To see wassup? for the month of December
Oh shit, it's the 5th, time for my favorite spot
It's time to get me a motherfuckin' flu shot

Chorus:
Yeah, yo I'mma get a flu shot
Hey, you coughin', but guess what? I'm not
Why? Cuz I got me a flu shot
That's right, I got me a motherfuckin' flu shot

Verse 2:
Pulled up to the lot in my big Escalade
Pulled out my coupons cuz I get shots prepaid
Sit on the line for about an hour
Then felt a little hungry and I picked up some chowder
Oh hell no!
The chowder was Manhattan, not New England
So I pulled out my musket til the bullets started sprinklin'

Chorus:
Yeah
I'mma get a flu shot
Hey, you sneezin' but guess what? I'm not
Why? Cuz I got me a flu shot
That's right, I got me a motherfuckin' flu shot

Verse 3:
After I start shootin', everyone ran away
So I was the only one gettin' a flu shot that day
I stepped up to the counter and I said
"Hi, how are you? I came to get shot up, you know the one for the flu?"

Chorus:
Yeah
Yo I'mma get a flu shot
Hey you all bloated and nasty and I'm not
Why? Cuz I got me a flu shot
That's right, I got me a motherfuckin' flu shot

Verse 4:
She sat me down before she shot me up
I threw my hair back because I love that stuff
Said "We done now, you can put yo pants back on"
And I said "Thank you miss I-"

I don't really know why I had to take my my pants off
Actually, actually looking back, I was completely naked(That's it
That's that smooth shit though
You know how it is
Yes)

Uh, shut a hater mouth
Plug it with a tampon
So all my haters sleep
With a fuckin' lamp on
I slap a ratchet with a
Palm full of talcum
Cause I'm just a ratchet straight
Schemin' like Plankton

All up in the whip
Ghost ride like a drifter
Girl is a walrus
She a shape-shifter
Yeah I got that shake
Pour it down in the sifter
Tia and Tamara
God damn, god sisters

[Hook x2]

Yo when I spit, they squirt
When I spit, they squirt and
Awkwafina make it wet
All they haters hurtin'

Catch me in they Pokeball

Now all these bitches done

Fuck your water gun

Fresh water salmon

I guess you win some and lose some
But my fortune cookies have always read true, son
I got a mouth from the motherfucking west
An involuntary underdog, motherfucking METS
And all these sneak bitches hop up on the train
They squirt when I spit, so yea I make it rain
They scream when I hit, I know exactly what they're saying
I love Awkwafina just like Gucci Gucci Mane does

But I think I catch a Law and Order marathon
Send a couple texts, put a motherfucking Snuggie on

I will be happy to take some questions

[Spoken Interlude: Awkwafina]
You know, the thing with me is that I was born with a second vestigial gooch
To have that burden
In a—in a spiritual way
In a philosophical way
In just a physiological—like walking around—
They would call me double-gooch
Loads of gooch
Having a second vestigial gooch actually solidified my identity more, as, as you know
Asian
Female
Second-gooch

[Verse 2: Awkwafina]
Yeah
Tryna shake my ass
To some Neptunes
Wake up in the morning

Unconstitutional

I could, I could be your Peggy
I could be your Peggy
I could, I could be your Peggy

If you be my Al Bundy
If you be my Al Bundy (yo), be my Al Bundy
If you be my Al Bundy[Hook]
Queefing like a G, bitch
Queefing like a G, bitch
Queefing like a G
Queefing like, queefing like like a G

[Verse 1]
I queefs in the morning and I queefs in the night
I went to Benihana and I queefed on sight
I queefs in the trap, queef queefs in the trap
People at the club stare when I'm queefing like that
I don't give a fuck man
All up on the bus man
Queefing lacks treble but the bass is turnt up man

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm F. Scott Queefsgerald
Gatsby of the queef game
Wuthering queefs, cos I'm queefing like a Brontë
I queef out the chorus of Don't Stop Believing
So I can hit an El while these white girls singing
I queef on the B train
Queef on the E train
Chilling at Nassau waiting for the G train
80 minutes later, waiting for the G train
90 minutes later, waiting for the G train
(Waiting for the G train)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm Vin Disel of the fast and the queefiest
Tokyo Drift, and mine is the breeziest
Queefenor Roosevelt, fireside queefing
Gotta queef soft when my roommates sleeping
I queef on your sister and I queef on your cousin
Then I show your granddad a little queef loving
I queef on your Jerk Seitan, cuz I'm Kobe
Queefing Han Solo
Queefy Wan Kenobi

[Hook]Faux thugging
Killa queens loving
You with that bitch look like Pooh Bear's cousin
Block hugging
Bitches liking danger
Saber Tooth Tiger
I'm a ma'fucking Yellow Ranger
And Awkwafina just a ratchet ho
Instagramming kitties, topping swag up on that FroYo
Deez make us out of space
Dollars never saving face
Roll up with these chicken heads
Acting like we own the place
Yo
And I bring that yellow to the rap game
High with these little eyes, Po can't tell if I'm blazed
Shout out to Greenpoint, Kielbasa in the oven
Greenpoint where all the bitches look like Lena Dunham but
Direct deposit that heat up in your inbox
9-to-5 office thighs, scanning on the xerox
But I got some time for a bagel and a muffin
Team, moving forward damn these bitches can't say nothing
But I got this all up on my LinkedIn
Proficient in spitting, turning red when I'm drinking
Emancipating pussy like I was Abe Lincoln
Squirting out that Kool-Aid til all these ratchets sinking, sinking
