[Intro]
Aw Yea, I'm with this
I'm just gonna sit here laid back to this nice mellow beat, you know
And drop some smooth lyrics
Cause it's '88
Time to set it straight, know what I'm saying?
And ain't no half stepping
Word, I'm ready:

[Verse 1]
Rappers stepping to me, they want to get some
But I'm the Kane, so yo, you know the outcome
Another victory
They can't get with me
So pick a BC date cause you're history
I'm the authentic poet to get lyrical
For you to beat me, it's gonna take a miracle
And, stepping to me, yo that's the wrong move
So what you on, Hobbs, dope or dog food?
Competition I just devour
Like a pit bull against a Chihuahua
Cause when it comes to being dope, hot damn
I got it good, now let me tell you who I am
The B-I-G D-A-double D-Y K-A-N-E
Dramatic, Asiatic, not like many
I'm different, so don't compare me to another
Cause they can't hang, word to the mother
At least not with the principal in this pedigree
So when I roll on you rappers, you better be
Ready to die because you're petty
You're just a butter knife, I'm a machete
That's made by Ginsu, wait until when you
Try to front, so I can chop into
Your body, just because you try to be basing
Friday the 13th, I'mma play Jason
No type of joke, gag, game, puzzle or riddle
The name is Big Daddy, yes Big not little
So define it
Here's your walking papers, sign it
And take a walk
As the Kane start to talk, cause

[Hook]
Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane

[Verse 2]
My rhymes are so dope and
The rappers be hoping
To sound like me, so soon I'll have to open
A school of emceeing, for those who want to be in
My field in court
Then again on second thought
To have emcees coming out sounding so similar
It's quite confusing for you to remember
The originator, and boy do I hate a
Perpetrator, but I'm much greater
The best oh yes I guess suggest the rest should fess
Don't mess or test your highness
Unless you just address with best finesse
And bless the paragraph I manifest
Rap prime minister, some say sinister
Non-stopping the groove, until when it's the
Climax, and I max, relax and chill
Have a break from a take of me acting ill
Brain cells are lit, ideas start to hit
Next the formation of words that fit
At the table I sit, making it legit
And when my pen hits the paper, ahh shit!
I stop and stand strong over emcees
And devour with the power of Hercules
Or Samson, but I go further the length
Cause you could scalp my Cameo and I'll still have strength
And no, that's not a myth, and if you try to riff
Or get with, the man with the given gift of gab
Your vocab, I'll only ignore
Be sleeping on your rhymes till I start to snore
You can't awake me, or even make me
Fear you, son, cause you can't do me none
So, think about it if you're trying to go
When you want to step to me, I think you should know there

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I appear right here and scare and dare
A mere musketeer that would dare to compare
Put him in the rear, back there where he can't see clear
Get a beer, idea or near stare, yeah
So on to be want to be competition
Trying to step to me--must be on a mission
Up on the stage is where I'mma get you at
You think I'm losing?
Psst, picture that

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
The name is Big Daddy, you know, as in your father
So when you hear a def rhyme, believe that I'm the author
I grab the mic and make emcees evaporate
The party people say 'Damn, that rapper's great'
The creator conductor of poetry
Et cetera, et cetera, it ain't easy being me
I speak clearly so you can understand
Put words together like Letter Man
Now that's dictation, proceeding to my innovation
Not like the other MC's that are an imitation
Or an animation, a cartoon to me
But when I'm finished, I'm sure that you are soon to see
Reality, my secret technique
Because I always speak with mentality
I put my title in your face, dare you to base
And if you try and come get it, yo I'mma show you who's with it
So if you know like I know, instead of messing around
Play like Roy Rogers and slooow doown
Just give yourself a break, or someone else will take
Your title, namely me, cause I'm homicidal
That means murder, cause I'm about to hurt a-
Nother MC, that try to get with me
I'll just break him and bake him and rake him
And take him and mold him and make him
Hold up the peace sign
As Salaam Alaikum![LL]
C'mon man

[News Report]
And with the local DBT news, LL Cool J with a triumphant comeback
[Mumbling]
But tonight

[LL]
Don't call it a comeback, I been here for years
Rocking my peers and putting suckas in fear
Making the tears rain down like a monsoon
Listen to the bass go boom
Explosion, overpowering
Over the competition, I'm towering
Wrecking shop, when I drop
These lyrics that'll make you call the cops
Don't you dare stare, you better move
Don't ever compare
Me to the rest that'll all get sliced and diced
Competition's paying the price

[Hook:] x 4
I'm gonna knock you out [HUUUH!!!]
Mama said knock you out [HUUUH!!!]

Don't you call this a regular jam
I'm gonna rock this land
I'm gonna take this itty bitty world by storm
And I'm just getting warm
Just like Muhummad Ali they called him Cassius
Watch me bash this beat like a skull
Cause you know I had beef wit
Why do you riff with me, the maniac psycho
And when I pull out my jammy get ready cause it might go
BLAAAAW, how ya like me now?
The ripper will not allow
You to get with, Mr. Smith, don't riff
Listen to my gear shift
I'm blasting, outlasting
Kinda like Shaft, so you could say I'm shafting
Olde English filled my mind
And I came up with a funky rhyme

[Hook]

Breakdown!!!

Shadow boxing when I heard you on the radio [HUUUH!!!]
I just don't know
What made you forget that I was raw?
But now I got a new tour
I'm going insane, starting the hurricane, releasing pain
Letting you know that you can't gain, I maintain
Unless ya say my name
Ripping, killing
Digging and drilling a hole
Pass the Ol' Gold

[Hook]

Shotgun blasts are heard
When I rip and kill, at will
The man of the hour, tower of power, I'll devour
I'm gonna tie you up and let you understand
That I'm not your average man
When I got a jammy in my hand
DAAAAAM!!!!! Oooooohh!!
Listen to the way I slaaaaay, your crew
Damage [UHH] damage[UHH] damage [UHH] damage
Destruction, terror, and mayhem
Pass me a sissy so suckas I'll slay him
Farmers [What!!!] Farmers [What!!!]
I'm ready [we're ready!!!]
I think I'm gonna bomb a town [get down!!]
Don't you never, ever, pull my lever
Cause I explode
And my nine is easy to load
I gotta thank God
Cause he gave me the strength to rock
HARD!! knock you out, mama said knock you out

[Hook](You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving)

[Verse 1]
I want a girl with extensions in her hair
Bamboo earrings, at least two pair
A Fendi bag and a bad attitude
That's all I need to get me in a good mood
She can walk with a switch and talk with street slang
I love it when a woman ain't scared to do her thing
Standing at the bus stop sucking on a lollipop
Once she gets pumping its hard to make the hottie stop
She likes to dance to the rap jams
She sweet as brown sugar with the candied yams
Honey coated complexion, using Camay
Lets hear it for the girl she's from around the way

[Hook]
I need an around the way girl
Around the way girl
That's the one for me
She's the only one for me
I need an around the way girl
[Verse 2]
Silky, milky her smile is like sunshine
That's why I had to dedicate at least one rhyme
To all the cuties in the neighborhood
Cause if I didn't tell you then another brother would
Your sweet like sugar with your gangster talk
Want to eat you like a cookie when I see you walk
With your rayon, silk or maybe even denim
It really doesn't matter as long as you're in 'em
You can break hearts and manipulate minds
Or surrender act tender be gentle and kind
You always know what to say and do
Cold flip when you think your man is playing you
Not cheap or petty, you're ready for loving
You're real independent so your parents be bugging
But if you ever need a place to stay
Come around my way

[Hook]
(To the bridge)

[Verse 3]
Perm in your hair or even a curly weave
Wictha New Edition Bobby Brown button on your sleeve
I tell you come here, you say meet me half way
Cause brothers been popping that game all day
Around the way you're like a neighborhood jewel
All the home boys sweat you so you're crazy cool
Wear your gold in the summer with your biking shorts
While you watching all the brothers on the basketball court
Going to the movies with your homegirls crew
While the businessmen in suits be hawking you
Baby, hair pumping, lip gloss is shining
I think you in the mood for wining and dining
So we can go out and eat somewhere
We got a lot of private jokes to share
Lisa, Angela, Pamela, Renee
I love you, you're from around the way

[Hook][Hook: Prodigy]
L.A. L.A. big city of dreams
But everything in L.A. ain't always what it seems
You might get fooled if you come from outta town
Cos we coming from Queens it gets down

[Noreaga]
Jose Luis Gotcha, golden guns and tons
General, Emanual, Iraq emerald
Government out to get me, trying to stick me
Move quickly, yo the God study swiftly
Indian style, knees bent, hands together
Regulate, drop a cake in like each state
Money to make, first of the month son chop the weight
Break the law and got a score like before
Armageddon, marries street smoke wedding
Invest cheddar in shopping sprees in Reading

[Havoc]
My crew in the front got it locked
My live niggas in the back got the gats
Yo we true to this black
4-4 likes to pour one to the dome, lubricate your thoughts
Black mask stole a ride to avoid up north
Jeopardize my freedom, blink out when I see him
But nine out of ten niggas wouldn't wanna be him
Rob him for his cash and spend it like per diem
Per diem, per diem, per diem...
A-yo this rap shit is ill, kid you make mad dough but still
Hit your crew off so they can sling krills
Show some love kid ain't no selfish shit here

(One love to that nigga Marley Marl)

[Hook]

[Capone]
I'm in too deep, losing sleep I can't call it
In love with this drug shit, loyal and all for it
What's a nigga to do - with no cash and 22?
Take it, or find out the best way to make it fast
My man's raking cash, fuck being lieutenant
I'm in it to win it so it might just take a minute
To gain grams, put my game plan in action
Ways to make it happen, today's to get the Jackson
Once the weight comes, I'm outta state triple sums
Stop my funds, I got guns to cripple sons
What's the use of heat, with no dough to flee the street
Caught a case with no trace of end, you're dead meat
Legal aid type of route'll have you shipped in greens
Ten thou for a lawyer now who splits your cream
Game is deeper than the sea itself
Agile moves that make fragile crews deflate under pressure
Take it to the next measure with all pleasure
And stack treasure, cheddar, illegal life forever

(Open Sesame)

(Yeah all together, like a butter soft leather)

[Tragedy Khadafi]
Been on this planet for 25 years and still strong
The world's rotten like the veins in my father's arm
I remain calm, study Islam, read the Torah
World going in flames like Sodom and Gomorrah
Niggas dried up, laying in the box from the virus
Commercial thugs try to bust gats at the livest
This life of crime only will shine real survivors
Y'all half-way niggas, I advise you not to try this
So brace yourself before you get yourself laced
Fucking with the sick Arabic Scarface
La ilaha illallah illallah
You're fucking with the God that's Gomar Oz Dubar
Official, my missile rips through your bone gristle
While you sneak thieving niggas get locked and blow the whistle
For the jake, my mouthpiece remains minute
Team made my bail, scooped me up in the Lex Coupe
Now I'm out, back to the galaxy of Queens
In between the crime scenes serving fans like fiends
Fiends, fiends, fiends...
So it seems...
Eternally, the game reverse and burn me
My man turned state's and took the 1 to 3
Snitching on me, how could it be? We was team
I guess we got divided by the cream
FBI ran in my crib, where I live
Snatched my wife, child welfare took my kids
Yo I can't live, I got hit with double life bid
From the stress, my head throbbing like a tumor
Its one o'clock, make a salaat, I catch Jumu'ah
Lay down my towel slide off my suede Pumas
The rumors spread around the jail like that
Been down for six joints holding down this flat
Latin Kings do they thing, ice pick for gat
Trying to lay my God Body cats all on they back
But never that

Yo, Q-B-C, 2-5 and Mobb Deep
Mami rest in peace
In sha'Allah
One love to that nigga Marley Marl

[Hook][Masta Ace]
Listen closely, so your attention's undivided
Many in the past have tried to do what I did
Just the way I came off then, I'm gonna come off
Stronger and longer, even with the drum off
I keep on goin' and flowin' just like a river
I got a whole lot to give so I'm-a give a
Little at a time, new trails are blazin'
Action is in effect, and always stays in
Yeah, just like a shot from a cannon
I am the man in charge and I've been plannin'
A jam strong enough that it can lift your soul
I'm the originator, and my rhymes are made of gold
Once you hear the capital "A" rap, it'll stay
With you for awhile, it won't go away
Unless you force it, because it stays with you, my friend
And if you toss it away, I'm-a hit ya again
I project my voice so it's right in the crowd
There's a sign at the door: no bitin' allowed
And if you didn't read it I suggest you do so
Or you'll be stranded, just like Crusoe
Sleep if ya wanna, go 'head, get some shut-eye
A man broke his jaw tryin' to say what I
Say on the microphone, you shoulda left it alone
Just for the record, let it be known
That my ego's only partially grown
And never will I ever condone biting in any form, yo I'm only warm
That verse was the calm, now here's the storm
Next up (Yo, I believe that's me)
Craig G, light up the mic for the Symphony

[Craig G]
This jam is dedicated to all un-optimistics
That though I wasn't coming out with some exquisite rhymes
But that's alright, cuz now I'm back
To kill all the rumors and straighten the facts of me
Not rockin' rhymes like I always used to
But you jumped on the tip when you heard me and the Juice Crew
You said, "Mmm mmm mmm, ain't that somethin?
Yo Craig, I heard you in that jam, and it's pumpin'!
I apologize. Oh yeah, and uh, can I have your autograph for me and my grandma?"
That's how I'm livin': on surprise mode
Don't even sleep, try not to keep your eyes closed
Cuz if you do, when you awaken, your so-called spot will be taken
I'll take you over like a greedy executive, cuz on the mic my prospective is
To be the best in all rap events, and since I have a call, I call experience
Next up...(Yo, I believe that's me)
Kool G Rap, light up the mic for the Symphony

[Kool G. Rap]
Yo, Marley gives the slice, I get nice
And my voice is twice as horrifying as Vincent Price
Goes deep, till you fell in a spell of a sleep
And while I'm countin' the money, you count sheep
When G Rap strikes the mic, I recite the type of hype that you like
That make the people unite
I grip up hips and zip up lips, step on reps, you flip and wanna sip on my tip
Take a deep breath, because you don't have another left
Comin' back like I'm avengin' my brother's death
Makin' veterans run for medicine
Cuz I put out more lights in a fight than Con Edison
Rip the damn cage like I'm on a rampage
So if you want rage, I'mma make front page
Read the headlines, suckers, todays the deadline
Your head is way past bedtime
Can't kill though. Solo. Cuz you're still all...soft like a pillow
My rap is rougher than Brillo
So fear me, don't dare dare me
And don't compare me to him when you hear me
Talk about a battle but you ain't yet ready for war
Your metaphor sucks more than a whore
You can't replace me, ice me or ace me
Bass me, face me, slice me or race me
Bite me or taste me -- I'll show you that I got force
My rap burns your mouth like hot sauce
Run for water while I break your tape recorder
Serve the sucker: the order is manslaughter
Another rapper, G Rap wrecks, he's rated X, that means the boy is sex. Next
The amplifier gets used and abused. Pumps so loud, we might blow a fuse
This is anger, madness, ready to hang a
Rapper or singer: I'm puttin' up my middle finger
Next up... (I believe that's me)
Big Daddy Kane, get on the mic for the Symphony

[Big Daddy Kane]
Settin' it off, lettin' it off, beginnin'
Rough to the endin', you never been in
To move the groove with the smooth rap lord;
Like a bottle of juice, rhymes are being poured
Down your ear, crisp and clear
As I prepare to wear, tear and smear -- then I'm outta here
With a mark left that you can all cling
Cause rockin' a party? Yo, it's a small thing
I rip many places on regular basis, and broken down mics were the only traces
That I'd been there and there at the party
The mic had my prints, and on it was a body
So take caution. I'm not horsin' around in a throwdown, clown
I'm takin' yours son
So just acknowledge the way that I kicked it
Cause if rap was a house, you'd be evicted
And dismissed from the microphone, chokin' on a bone, cause Daddy's home
And battlin' me is hazardous to your health
So put a quarter in your ass, cause ya played yourself
Like a game in the arcade. You need a far aid
I'm walkin' the path that Allah made
I'll attend and then begin to send a speech to reach and teach
So just say when
So I can let lyrics blast like a bullet
My mouth is the gun; on suckers I pull it
The trigger, ya figure, my pockets gettin' bigger
Cause when it comes to money, yo, Grant's my nigga!
You've got the groove, emcees, freeze, stand still, nobody move
It's a sabotage, as I take charge. Don't barge, cause goddamn, I'm livin' large
Like a giant. You're nothin' but a midget, a small digit
You ain't hit it, forget it, quit it
I reign superior, always takin' care o'ya
No-frill rappers, you will evaporate, disintegrate, deflate to your fate
As the great will dominate straight to the state
Of reignin', gainin'. So put Kane in, that category. Period. End of story[Here it comes...]

[Documentary sample:
Since the far-off days when man first heard a scratchy noise
On a cylindrical drum accompanied by staccato human tones
It has been his aim to add breadth and depth, to give realism
And spaciousness, and, even where it applies, to convey actual movement]

Intro:
I start to go, my rhymes'll flow
So, get up and dance cause Kane said so
If you were lounging around it's time to get up
Pardon my expression, but I'mma tear shit up
I appear right here, and scare and dare, a mere musketeer
That would dare to compare, I do declare
Getting busy is where it's at
But what you're saying, you wouldn't get a point for that
Cause you're a featherweight, and your rhymes you carry light
But I drop bass just like Barry White
So how could you think that you pose a threat?
You say you're rocking, how many shows you get?
All your vocals go local on the M-I-C
Mines go a great distance, like AT&T
I'm not new to this, I'm true to this, nothing you can do to this
Fuck around with Kane and come out black and blue for this
So, yo, go for what you know
Attempt to debate so I can humiliate
We can go rhyme for rhyme, word for word, verse for verse
Get you a nurse, too late, get you a hearse
To take you to your burial ground
Because the Big Daddy Kane always throws down
Correct, I get respect, I'm out to collect
Cash money, cause I get raw

[Break]
Everybody get up! (x4)
Kane: boy do I hate a...
I'm coming! (x5)

Here I am, R-A-W
A terrorist, here to bring trouble to
Phony MC's, I move on and seize
I just conquer and stomp another rapper with ease
Cause I'm at my apex and others are below
Nothing but a milliliter, I'm a kilo
Second to none, making MC's run
So don't try to step to me, cause I ain't the one
I relieve rappers just like Tylenol
And they know it, so I don't see why you all
Try to front, perpetrating a stunt
When you know that I'll smoke you up like a blunt
I'm genuine like Gucci, raw like sushi
To stage a rage is what rap did to me
To make me want to create chaos and mayhem
Cold rock a party until the A.M
I'll make a muscle, grab the mic and hustle
While you stand dazed and amazed, I bust a
Little rhyme with authority, superiority
And captivate the whole crowd's majority
The rhymes I use definitely amuse
Better than Dynasty, or Hill Street Blues
I'm sure to score adored for more without a flaw
Cause I get raw

[Break]
Everybody get up! (x5)

With speech like a reverend, rappers start severing
And in my lifetime, believe I've never been
Beaten, or eaten and just tooken out
You know, come to think about it, I keep MC's looking out
And real nervous when I'm at your service
Give me that title, boy, you don't deserve this
I work like a slave to become a master
And when I say a rhyme, you that it has to
Be perfectly fitted, cause I'm committed
The entertainer and trainer and Kane'll get with it
I go and flow and grow to let you know
I damage ya I'm not an amateur but a pro-
-fessional unquestionable without doubt superb
So full of action, my name should be a verb
My voice will float on every note
When I clear my throat, that's all she wrote!
The minute that the Kane starts to go on
Believe it's gonna be smooth sailing so on
As I put other rappers out of their misery
Get them in a battle and make them all history
Ruling and schooling MC's that I'm dueling
Watch them all take a fall as I sit back cooling
On my throne, with a bronze microphone
Hmm, God bless the child that can hold his own
Cause I get raw

[Break]
Ain't it good to you? (x3)
Documentary: here's an experiment to begin with...

Twenty-four sev chilling, killing like a villain
The meaning of raw is Ready And Willing
To do whatever is clever, take a loss, never
And the rhymes I bust, coming off is a must
And I come off hard with rhymes that are odd
I rip the microphone and leave it scarred
Never smoking or hitting or taking a sniff
Only crushing MC's that be trying to riff
I get strong and titanic, do work like a mechanic
Make MC's panic, they all get frantic
And skeptic, like a girl on a contraceptive
As I rock but hey, what you expected?
I'll get raw for you just like a warrior
Rapping like a samurai and I'll be damned if I
Ever let a Fisher-Price MC hang
Their rhymes are toy, nothing but yin-yang
So if we battle on the microphone
Bring your own casket and tombstone
And I'mma preach your funeral
Tell me who in the world could ever come with more
I get rawThe act of makin' love...is...

She said, "You know the Same Gang and my Flava Unit too?"
I said, "You only knew the certain things I wanna do, do you?"
Rub ya down with warm Ice-T
Make ya feel Brand Nubian
In-stant-ly
Boogie Down
And check this Production
Gimme them lips
They look good for suction
She said, "Sweet tease
Cool with a little almond joy
On the side
Just doin' the fly"
You like poundcake?
Comin' to my house
Turn on the lights
And see me on the couch
I said, "Do the jingle
And your from around the way
I like your earrings
L's
But anyway...
Your grand-daddy is
Here to spread cheer
Somethin' nice and smooth
With my tongue in your ear
Give me a snack
Some salt and pepper on a burger
Ice Cube T
Or if you prefer the
Taste of honey Kid
Ride in my Capri and
That's the joint
They got the real clear CD in

I don't know what type of man ya are
You might know karate
Do me and get away
I got a glimpse of your license plate
N-W-A."

But I ain't sayin nothin
(I know why you're here)
I ain't sayinLet's get wild
Yeah, Master Ace in the house
The whole Action Posse's in the house
Ice-U-Rock's in the house, DJ Marley Marl's in the house
Steady Pace is in the house, and we gonna do it like this

So many New Jacks and Jills on the hill
But only one bucket, so fuck it, they get the dills
Cause you no frills, that means your name ain't household
Now watch that little mouse fold
You can't take the pressure from the cooker
Stood there looking soft, so I started hooking off
And took her, I know she used to be yours
Now she's riding on the bus with us and doing tours
Along with some other little runts
We call her a fall girl, she does so many stunts
And then she got liver, she did it with the guy that drives the bus
Now she's a screw driver
Master Ace is flipping
Your grip is slipping, it's time I start stripping
Young ladies and the titles that hold 'em
I treat 'em like a pretzel: bend, stretch, and fold 'em
And I can do the same damage on stage
Black, white, or beige, you're gonna feel the rage
The same way the sluts with the big butts felt it
I'm not a dealer but I dealt it
So if you plan on riffing when I spank ya
Be prepared to grab your ankles because

(Ace is wild!) No, not really
(Ace is wild!) Come on, you're acting silly
(Ace is wild!) You know I'm just chilling
(Ace is wild!) Come on, stop illing

For whom the bell tolls, it tolls for all of those
Who lost out, cause I was at the polls
And I saw the results as they came in
So many wild-ass ones that need taming
But I hold a whip and a chair
And I don't play fair, so you'd better stay there
Until I say "Jump through the fire"
But I won't get burned, I learned to admire
]From way across the room first
And after I study, buddy, that's when I kick a verse
That's high powered, you got devoured
By the jaws of death, you little coward
Scared to step in this arena
Where the grass is greener, you're looking meaner and meaner
But your look ain't scaring me away
So I just stay and say words to make your head sway
Capital A-C-E, boy
Serving the masses, you'd better take some classes
If you want to hang with this here
And if you get near, I'll eat you like a pear (Crunch)
But I don't really eat a lot of fruit
So say "ahh" (Mmmmmmph!) Now don't you look cute?

(Ace is wild!) Nah, no I'm not
(Ace is wild!) I just like to bug a lot
(Ace is wild!) Leave me alone
(Ace is wild!) Turn up the microphone
(Ace is wild!) Yeah...

Mr. Gangster, who you trying to kid?
Fake, flam, and fess and dress the way you did
This is a microphone war
You say you're well-known, but what are you known for?
A porno flick and a hard dick
And always bragging about the girls you stick
Title for king? Yo I don't compete for that
Paid your dues? Let me see a reciept for that
Somebody put you on yesterday
And you fess today, and that's just the way
A sucker is supposed to operate
Just turn on my mic and I'm straight
Now you fronting like you got a million G's
Just because you sold a couple of LP's
Now you walking around thinking you're the man
Cause you bought a little suit from Dapper Dan
But so what? You still ain't dapper
Holding the mic makes you look like a rapper
But you're just a sloppy copy cat
Front on me and I'm a hit you with a bat
Bottom of the nineth, two out, and I'm at the plate
And SMACK! Over the left field gate
That's where your head goes, you're Rudolph the Red Nosed
And you can't join in, you shouldn't have said those
Rhymes that sound so merrily merrily
Since you're soft like poundcake from Sarah Lee
I might cut a slice, then say "What a nice
Sucker to gobble up with beans and rice"
You fat little rat from the sewer
I eat you like a meal, pass you like maneuer
Put you in the garden where my flower grows
Then where's your power? Tell me where your power goes
Somebody does your dirty work for you
Throw up your hands like a man so I can floor you
And oh, if you pull a jammie
You can run from Brooklyn to Miami
]From Miami to Nevada
You'd better have a lotta, I mean a whole knot of
Payola, cause I'm about to roll a
Mic like a cess joint, so brother here's a bowl of
Pride, now eat it up
Cause I get kind of wild when I heat it up

(Ace is wild!) Nah, not really
(Ace is wild!) Come on, you're acting silly
(Ace is wild!) You know I'm just chilling
(Ace is wild!) Yo yo yo, stop illing
(Ace is wild!) No, I'm not
(Ace is wild!) I feel kinda hot
(Ace is wild!) But I'm not acting wild
(Ace is wild!) You know that ain't my style
(Ace is wild!) You know I'm just cooling
(Ace is wild!) And also I'm ruling
(Ace is wild!) I ain't messing with nobody
(Ace is wild!) I just wanna have a party
(Ace is wild!) No, no
(Ace is wild!) Come on, yo
(Ace is wild!) It's me and Marley Marl
(Ace is wild!) And I'm the Music Man, y'all[Intro]
Aw Yea, I'm with this
I'm just gonna sit here laid back to this nice mellow beat, you know
And drop some smooth lyrics
Cause it's '88
Time to set it straight, know what I'm saying?
And ain't no half stepping
Word, I'm ready:

[Verse 1]
Rappers stepping to me, they want to get some
But I'm the Kane, so yo, you know the outcome
Another victory
They can't get with me
So pick a BC date cause you're history
I'm the authentic poet to get lyrical
For you to beat me, it's gonna take a miracle
And, stepping to me, yo that's the wrong move
So what you on, Hobbs, dope or dog food?
Competition I just devour
Like a pit bull against a Chihuahua
Cause when it comes to being dope, hot damn
I got it good, now let me tell you who I am
The B-I-G D-A-double D-Y K-A-N-E
Dramatic, Asiatic, not like many
I'm different, so don't compare me to another
Cause they can't hang, word to the mother
At least not with the principal in this pedigree
So when I roll on you rappers, you better be
Ready to die because you're petty
You're just a butter knife, I'm a machete
That's made by Ginsu, wait until when you
Try to front, so I can chop into
Your body, just because you try to be basing
Friday the 13th, I'mma play Jason
No type of joke, gag, game, puzzle or riddle
The name is Big Daddy, yes Big not little
So define it
Here's your walking papers, sign it
And take a walk
As the Kane start to talk, cause

[Hook]
Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane

[Verse 2]
My rhymes are so dope and
The rappers be hoping
To sound like me, so soon I'll have to open
A school of emceeing, for those who want to be in
My field in court
Then again on second thought
To have emcees coming out sounding so similar
It's quite confusing for you to remember
The originator, and boy do I hate a
Perpetrator, but I'm much greater
The best oh yes I guess suggest the rest should fess
Don't mess or test your highness
Unless you just address with best finesse
And bless the paragraph I manifest
Rap prime minister, some say sinister
Non-stopping the groove, until when it's the
Climax, and I max, relax and chill
Have a break from a take of me acting ill
Brain cells are lit, ideas start to hit
Next the formation of words that fit
At the table I sit, making it legit
And when my pen hits the paper, ahh shit!
I stop and stand strong over emcees
And devour with the power of Hercules
Or Samson, but I go further the length
Cause you could scalp my Cameo and I'll still have strength
And no, that's not a myth, and if you try to riff
Or get with, the man with the given gift of gab
Your vocab, I'll only ignore
Be sleeping on your rhymes till I start to snore
You can't awake me, or even make me
Fear you, son, cause you can't do me none
So, think about it if you're trying to go
When you want to step to me, I think you should know there

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I appear right here and scare and dare
A mere musketeer that would dare to compare
Put him in the rear, back there where he can't see clear
Get a beer, idea or near stare, yeah
So on to be want to be competition
Trying to step to me--must be on a mission
Up on the stage is where I'mma get you at
You think I'm losing?
Psst, picture that

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
The name is Big Daddy, you know, as in your father
So when you hear a def rhyme, believe that I'm the author
I grab the mic and make emcees evaporate
The party people say 'Damn, that rapper's great'
The creator conductor of poetry
Et cetera, et cetera, it ain't easy being me
I speak clearly so you can understand
Put words together like Letter Man
Now that's dictation, proceeding to my innovation
Not like the other MC's that are an imitation
Or an animation, a cartoon to me
But when I'm finished, I'm sure that you are soon to see
Reality, my secret technique
Because I always speak with mentality
I put my title in your face, dare you to base
And if you try and come get it, yo I'mma show you who's with it
So if you know like I know, instead of messing around
Play like Roy Rogers and slooow doown
Just give yourself a break, or someone else will take
Your title, namely me, cause I'm homicidal
That means murder, cause I'm about to hurt a-
Nother MC, that try to get with me
I'll just break him and bake him and rake him
And take him and mold him and make him
Hold up the peace sign
As Salaam Alaikum!(LL Cool J)
Here we go - another funky style
Peace to my brothers on "Rikers' Isle"
Introducin' the crew, that's goin' a mile
To get behind the ropes, stop actin' wild
This here part is like section one
So you can bug-a-loo and set fire to your buns
Early mornin' light is yet to come
And when it come, we'll get buggy in the sun
Females - let your hair down
Cause this is how we do it when we go uptown
With the funky sound, the razzamatazz
You give me to the "sploshers", you can get your-a blast
Enter at your own risk - some brothers got weapons
Yet you're still steppin', the beats' so funkafied
And answer to the bone, people'll be dancin' alone
Leanin' on the wall next to grandma's mop
With the funky, funky groove that's far from pop
Dosey-do your partner all night long
And all you mothers, bring your kids along

(Chorus: LL Cool J)
(Yo Uncle) whassup, whassup?
(Yo Uncle) yeah, I do a little somethin'
(Yo Uncle) whassup, whassup?
(Yo Uncle) Huh, I do a little somethin'
(Yo Uncle) whassup, whassup?
(Yo Uncle) yeah, hah, I do a little somethin'
(Yo Uncle) whassup, whassup?
(Yo Uncle) (just kick a little somethin'...)

(LL Cool J)
Ain't no mountain high enough to overcome this
Funky-like type of stuff
The feds are ridiculous, they call my bluff
Oh, my wrists are too skinny to hold me with cuffs
I got the sure-shot guaranteed mover
Suck it like a hoover and do ya whole maneuver
Don't stop till you get it on
With ya head be- boppin' like a bouncy ball
They do it in the park, they do it in the mall
But when I do it (yeah), I'm doin' it for y'all
Asiatic, automatic, your funky fanatic without no static
Flippin' on the freak like I'm acrobatic
You were searchin' for the funk and I had it
Here we go - hand over the cash yo
What chime? Aiyyo, blast the tobasco
Work your body like a dime, oh no
Do the freaky-deaky - the whole girls' cargo
Females on the side - we gotta win 'em, yeah
The back pockets are stuck with nothin' in 'em, yeah
Except my beeper number, rubbin' all my lumber so I cannot slumber
Makes me sick like an earthquake
So do the baddy-too-true, we got cash to make
Able body, ready to party, all the ladies in the house
Must be eatin' hardy
And provin' and movin', groovin', so soothin' good for ya
And clinically proven - damn!!
Every little bit of the tip makes ya taste flip, like sugar on Ritz
Get on down, to the sure-shot sound
Cause all five burrows are rockin' uptown

(Chorus: LL Cool J)
(Yo Uncle) whassup, whassup?
(Yo Uncle) yeah, I do a little somethin'
(Yo Uncle) whassup, whassup?
(Yo Uncle) whattup, hah, I do a little somethin'
(Yo Uncle) whassup, whassup?
(Yo Uncle) yeah, hah, I do a little somethin'
(Yo Uncle) whassup, whassup?
(Yo Uncle) aiyyo, aiyyo (just kick a little somethin'...)

(LL Cool J)
Pump up the nasty, nasty, nasty sound
Kick back and let it please ya like a rub down
Put ya body in the lost and found
(Kick that L) I love the way its goin' down
What you see is what you get
And all the words who's next to be the teachers pet?
Down-home monkey - corn fed, original
And what you do is up to you, the individual
This is the place to be for y'all underage brothers
With the rebel mentality
Sweet young freaks sayin "Rock me ?Arma-day-us?
Skin so smooth lookin' all (???)
Video to video, tape to tape
Walkin' through the jam in search of a playmate
Party is packed like a rich mans' fridge
Too many people in the crib
The situation is sweaty and crazy like Eddy
And yes we are ready to funk it up steady
Ain't nothin' here petty
Trip down to your laund-a-ray - I'm ready!!
Hold your horse, and baby feel the force
And get jaws off - no matter what the cost
Come out to cloth, get hot like a stove
Early in the mornin', we're dancin' in robes
To a funkafied sweaty, greazy groove
I know the Marley remix to make you move

(Chorus: LL Cool J)
(Yo Uncle) whassup, whassup?
(Yo Uncle) yeah, I do a little somethin'
(Yo Uncle) whassup, whassup?
(Yo Uncle) I do a little somethin'
(Yo Uncle) whassup, whassup?
(Yo Uncle) peace out, hah, I did a little somethin'A one two, a one two
A one two, a one two
I'd like to introduce myself
My name is Biz Markie
My MC name is Shan
And Shanté
And TJ Swan
My DJ is Marley Marl
We down with Mr. Magic
My manager's Fly Ty
We came to rock for Brooklyn
And Queens
And Manhattan
And the Bronx
And Staten Island
I can't forget New Jersey
And Long Island
And all over the world
We came to rock for everybody, uh like this

Get up, get on up [3x]

What goes up
Must come down
You are amazed
By how I do the sound
I'm, the, human orchestraaa

*Biz beatboxes*

[Biz talking while tapping his throat]
My name is the Biz Markie

*more beatboxing until end*(You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving)

[Verse 1]
I want a girl with extensions in her hair
Bamboo earrings, at least two pair
A Fendi bag and a bad attitude
That's all I need to get me in a good mood
She can walk with a switch and talk with street slang
I love it when a woman ain't scared to do her thing
Standing at the bus stop sucking on a lollipop
Once she gets pumping its hard to make the hottie stop
She likes to dance to the rap jams
She sweet as brown sugar with the candied yams
Honey coated complexion, using Camay
Lets hear it for the girl she's from around the way

[Hook]
I need an around the way girl
Around the way girl
That's the one for me
She's the only one for me
I need an around the way girl
[Verse 2]
Silky, milky her smile is like sunshine
That's why I had to dedicate at least one rhyme
To all the cuties in the neighborhood
Cause if I didn't tell you then another brother would
Your sweet like sugar with your gangster talk
Want to eat you like a cookie when I see you walk
With your rayon, silk or maybe even denim
It really doesn't matter as long as you're in 'em
You can break hearts and manipulate minds
Or surrender act tender be gentle and kind
You always know what to say and do
Cold flip when you think your man is playing you
Not cheap or petty, you're ready for loving
You're real independent so your parents be bugging
But if you ever need a place to stay
Come around my way

[Hook]
(To the bridge)

[Verse 3]
Perm in your hair or even a curly weave
Wictha New Edition Bobby Brown button on your sleeve
I tell you come here, you say meet me half way
Cause brothers been popping that game all day
Around the way you're like a neighborhood jewel
All the home boys sweat you so you're crazy cool
Wear your gold in the summer with your biking shorts
While you watching all the brothers on the basketball court
Going to the movies with your homegirls crew
While the businessmen in suits be hawking you
Baby, hair pumping, lip gloss is shining
I think you in the mood for wining and dining
So we can go out and eat somewhere
We got a lot of private jokes to share
Lisa, Angela, Pamela, Renee
I love you, you're from around the way

[Hook]Arrest the president

Too much affection with no protection
Leads injection to infection
Now you're pregnant, baby to carry
You love Barry, but he won't marry
Got an abortion, spent a fortune
Shoulda used caution, mind-distortion
Out of touch, out of tune, and out of time
You're damn near out of your mind
Slit your wrist, cause you couldn't live through it
Now you claim that the devil made you do it
Undertaker, he'll just make a
Coffin to fit ya and take your picture
Pull out the bible, bust the scripture
It's too late, Tragedy hit ya
Life is a gift you took for granted
Your mother's buggin, her mind is slanted
Pain so deep in her heart it's planted
Someone yelled out: Get the hell out
Evil fell out, but I'm no sell-out
Black's the mineral, white subliminal
Arrest the president, he's the criminal
No one's laughin this, I keep rappin this
He's the happiest, we're the nappiest
He's the vulture, stole your culture
Broke the sculpture to insult ya
Underrated, we're all related
Assassinated, I just hate it
Mothers cryin, brothers dyin
Someone's lyin, I keep tryin
Doin it right, ready to fight
Shedin a light, steady in flight
Pro-black explosion, doors are closin
Brains are frozen, I'm the chosen
Allah's the force for my ressource
To slay on course without remorse
Flipped and flopped it, hipped and hopped it
I just dropped it, no one stopped it
Poetical prophet, political topic
Don't reject this, just inject this
Bold in blackness, young and reckless
Non-recruitable, anti-shootable
The name is suitable, black is beautiful
Mind was empty, now it's filled in
Time for buildin, teach the children
You wanna erase my misplaced race
Just to make America a beautiful white place?
That's not happenin, I'll keep rappin, and
Crowds attractin, and you're subtractin, and
I discover, unite the lover
Teach the brother, fight the other
Young black eagle hunting evil
I want peace, but that's illegal
Young brothers doin life in prison
Love is life and life is worth livin
Al Islam, read the Qur'an
Grab the mic and drop bombs
Threw on my boots, stepped to my roots
Black is dominant, that's enough proof
Separation of integration
Strong foundation, Nubian Nation
Microphonist blessed with a bonus
Pray to give thanks and help the homeless
Use the mind the creator gave ya
Won't enslave ya, but he'll save ya
There's no debate, time to penetrate
I can't wait for the pain to deflate
I'm livin in a land of hate
Take my hand, blackman, and let's stand
And find this promised land
Arrest the president

Politics, polished tricks
Makes me sick, ready to flip
Pimpin ain't easy, it's greasy
Grimy, slimy, slouchy, sleazy
Who the fuck you think you are, mister?
Tryin to pimp some young black sister
Still talkin that pimp shit talk
Pretty boys don't survive up north
Now you're turned out, you shoulda got out
Time has burned out, sad how you found out
Money and cars made you feel real good
Tell me, was it worth your manhood?
Homicidal, that was your title
Pimpin is vital, now you're suicidal
Revolution, execution
Mind polution, no solution
Disregard it, heart of harlem
Had no pardon, snake in the garden
Culture stealer, big high wheeler
Arrest the president, he's the drug dealer
Chief command and got his hand in
Drugs demandin, kept it standin
Hands were dipped in, someone flipped in
Made a mistake and stopped the shipment
F.B.I. fronts the fourth guy
He can't lie, so it's time to fry
Witness greedier, cause the media
Scared to death and his heart gets speedier
Life in prison, he starts bitchin
In a few months, he'll be snitchin
A new collection, police protection
Misconception, no direction
New face, new name, same game
You took the blame
Case gets older, lost in folder
Yo. they played ya out like a soldier
Tapped your phone, bugged your residence
Yo, arrest the president

(Arrest the president)
Arrest the president

Arrest the muthafuckin president

(Arrest the president)[Verse One]
I'm the Biz Markie, I'm known for beatboxin and rap
And now it's time, to put Long Island on the map
And lettin you know, that it'll put you in a trance
It's somethin funny made by me and it's called the Biz Dance
I think the way I do it is so unique
By the way I move my hands hips legs and feet
But if you think that you can master it you got a fat chance
Cause it's very difficult to do, what is it called?

[Hook]
The Biz Mark, Biz Mark.. the Biz Mark, Biz Mark
The Biz Mark, Biz Mark.. the Biz Mark, Biz Mark, Biz Mark

[Verse Two]
The Biz Mark Dance, is second to none
I'll explain at the moment how it should be done
Kick your legs 'til your pants almost rip
Shake from side to side, witcha arms and hips
While you're doin it, if you mess up your hair
Then you know party people that you're halfway there
They've heard of Biz Markie all the way in France
And the kids in AntARCTICA is doin my dance!

[Hook] - 2X w/ ad libs

[Interlude]
Now everybody out there that wanna learn the Biz Dance
Come up to the front, all the ladies to one side
And all the homeboys to one side
And I'mma show you how you should do it
You should throw one leg to one side
And then throw the other leg up to the other side
Then throw your leg up above your head
And then, this the way you do it
One.. two..
One, two, three, here!

"Go Biz Mark! Go Biz Mark! Go Biz Mark! Go Biz Mark!"
"Go Biz Mark! Go Biz Mark! Go Biz Mark! Go Biz Mark!"
"Go Biz Mark! Go Biz Mark! Go Biz Mark! Go Biz Mark!"
"Go Biz Mark! Go Biz Mark!"

[Verse One]

[Hook] - 3X w/ ad libs

[Outro]
Now I know Fort Greene can do the Biz Dance
And Queensbridge can do the Biz Dance
And Atlantic turtles can do the Biz Dance
White {?} Lawanda can do the Biz Dance
40 and Baisley can do the Biz Dance
And Astoria Projects can do the Biz Dance
Everybody on Farmers Boulevard can do the Biz Dance
And I know Bayshore, C.I., Amityville, Wyandanch
Brentwood, Corey, everywhere in Long Island can do the Biz Dance
Hempstead, Shreveport, everywhere can do the Biz Dance
Manhattan, Lincoln Projects in Colonial can do the Biz Dance
Even the Bronx Co-Op City Bronx River can do the Biz Dance
But, they can't do it like me, HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!(Black I'm proud)

(I'm black and I'm proud)
(Black I'm proud)
(I'm black)
(Can't stop the bumrush)

[ VERSE 1 ]
Blessed with the talented format
I'm kickin the earth like a doormat
The more I grow the more I understand
And I don't really care about a grafted man
Cause he wants to mold me, shape and carve me
But I use my mind like Marcus Garvey
Dr. King was a man with the new faith
They got rid of him, that was the last day
Clueless clucks, the men of a Klan
Cult to crucify the intelligent blackman
Honoured as African and die as a dweller
Reach out to teach like Nelson Mandela
Power for all my people
The Rebel's back and the brothers are equal
So let's unite so we can all resist him
Black, the shade of the solar system
Freedom of speech, I scream it loud

I'm livin this race like a marathon
And I'm goin out like Farrakhan
But he's not out cause the brother is all in
The blackman was here since the day it began
Beware, the cursed seed is out there
Tragedy will live for a light year
As long as we fight and go all out for each other
Black'll be the color of my brothers
Find your ancestors and what they did
Cause intelligent blacks built pyramids
Seek and obtain, you'll find descriptions
Pyramids were built by Egyptians
Who put up plantations to work the fastest
Mothers and sisters raped by slavemasters
Gamed by the devil and swift talkers
And till this day my brothers are sleepwalkers
Tricked by the devil to feel inferior
In all reality my people are superior
Freedom of speech, I scream it loud
Proud to be black cause black I'm proud

Born a freedom fighter, here to keep fightin
Illustratin the issue on a government item
Africa is in need but the government's steppin
Collectin taxes for testin weapons
You can stand by the Rebel cause I know it's gonna be
A better day, another way, I'm proud to say
Black is dominant and here to stay
Before this day I cannot wait
To see who will win over love and hate
Use your brain, don't kill it with base
A mind is a terrible thing to waste
Hannibal conquered Europe on elephants
Another blackman of intelligence
We grow with the black complex
But we should be encouraged by Malcolm X
With freedom of speech he spoke it loud

Proud to be black cause black he was proud

Their latest release (x2)
I'm Kool G Rap...and he's Polo]

He's the big boss when his hands criss-cross
Up and down the crossfader turning wax to sauce
It ain't a hip-hop record that he can't chop
Polo show them how it's done in the butcher shop

[Get violent (x3)]

The rhythm he brings makes the audience swing
While the plates rotates his fingers cling
To the records on felts, your earwax melts
Scratching so hard that he breaks the belts
DJ's relax, kneecaps collapse
My rap perhaps is like a booby trap
Polo the big boar, I'm the warrior of metaphor
Fully equipped manipulating my competitor
And I remain just like a stain
As long as I maintain my brainiac brain
Rap words rehearsed since first grade
My utensil is the pencil and his is a blade
The man at the top of the needle drop
Polo let's have some fun, show them how it's done
Treat them like your son, in the butcher shop

[Psychopath on the phonograph (x2)]

DJ's he's disputed you should be saluted
The man gives a cut with scratches included
I'm Kool G Rap, he's my DJ
This is a mortal combat of the Polo play
Cuts like a scissor, rips like a razor
The sound penetrates elements like a laser
The beat connects to my dialect
New Technic turntables, the party I wreck
Motivation to blend, the rotation begins
They reported his fins on 1010 West
And his name is Polo the phonograph is for bolo
I go solo, to battle Kool G Rap is no-no, bozo
Your style is so-so, equal to disco
Swing and some go-go, and on to calypso
So biters and reciters, don't mean to offend you
Yes I will continue but I'm not a menu
So don't bite or swallow or fight or follow
Recite or borrow rhymes and want to give them back tomorrow
Polo is like Zorro, war hero
Horror, terror, errors: zero
The alert concert network expert
He'll wreck dissect inject insert
Cuts, til your eardrums pop
Polo show them how it's done in the butcher shop

[Nut of the cuts]

I'm a walking dictionary, an encyclopedia
Rapper with data, the best in the media
Or area, so prepare for your burial
On your radio, pull out your aerial
Or antenna cause this one is a winner
Not a sinner, or an MC beginner
Kool G Rap is just me not he or she or we
Or any other MC
So please, I'm single and not plural
I'm totally high moral, excellent with the oral
Contact, and at the maximum, yo he's climax
DJ Polo attacks the earwax
In the butcher shop

If you want it you can lick from the front
If you want it

I like your stockings, stretch socks even your Reeboks
Thug you out, take you on tour, learn all the weed spots
We can sip wine, bump and grind on the slow-mo
But on the d-low I heard your man was a homo
We can combine just like Two-Five and DoLo
Tell me where to put it like solo
Meet me at 702 I like your steelo
Now boo face it, you're bangin' to your ankle bracelet
I went against the grain when I said I'd never taste it
You work all day come home ready for foreplay
Your favourite dish, harmony grits and fish saute
You love a thug boo, highly impressed by my tattoo
Slim cut, walk with a strut keepin' it natural
Your physical frame is like a Jada Pinkett
I like to hear you moan, spank it grab your X and O anklet
Freak off

[Hook]
If you want it you can lick from the front
If you want it
If you want it you can lick from the front

Sick and tired of your wannabe thug he got you heated
Knowin' that you need it but he's still afraid to eat it
Friday night you tell him that you out with the girls
But you're honin' in my world gettin' bent till you hurl
I got the fireplace, bearskin rug so kick your feet out
Hit me on a hit bay hundred I got the weed out
Hydro keep it on low now bust the weed out
Slide off the DKNY's so I can eat out
Jump inside a jet black 5 or watch you speed out
Adrenaline got you open like a stack of Benjamin's
Then back to the Bennigan's to eatin' pasta with Dominicans
Eat it up

Live niggas in the back say just a little

It was a caf? On
It was a caf? On the west side, midtown
It was a caf? On the west side, midtown

Said they had the best cap of Cappucino around
So I stepped in, and I ordered a cup
Someone grabbed me by my throat and said, "Shut the fuck up!"
And I did, pronto, quick fast
How much longer would the torture last?
In the wrong place, at the wrong time
It was a drug sale, I could feel from behind

Death, it was gettin' closer, right behind my back
Ready to attack
I got shot in a shoot out, and then I died
I could feel it, I was on the other side
In between lives, I'm so confused
What do I do, oh, what do I do?
But was it really time for me to go?

Why, oh why did I need Cappucino?
Why, oh why?
Why, oh why did I need Cappucino?
Why, oh why?
Why, oh why did I need Cappucino?

Why, oh why did I need Cappucino?
But then I calmed down, I spotted some friends
That I knew in a past life, way back when
A couple had died in a drug world
And this one guy died fightin' over his girl
Another died drivin' while intoxicated
Why do people make livin' so complicated?
But then I saw a girl, her name was Mary

Introduced to drugs by her boyfriend Harry
He sold crack to the kids on the uptown corners
A social worker named Hannah Smith tried to warn her
But she wouldn't listen, no one listens
I saw the light, I awakened, it was a dream
Man oh man, you shoulda heard me scream
So glad to be given - my life back
So good to be livin' - or is dead better?

I didn't have to run from the bullets or drugs
And I didn't have to run from the murderers or thugs
I didn't have to worry about fallin' from a plane
But at this caf? Was death still callin' my name?
Or did this caf? Even exist?
And was my name just another on the death list?
I knew it couldn't happen, even though
On the bottom of my shirt was a spot of Cappucino
Cappucino, Cappucino

Bust it, to some of you that really don't know
I break it down to you, the word 'Cappucino'
It's somewhat like coffee, then again not quite
It's creamy and smooth, and it goes down light
They charge you 3 dollars, you ask is it worth it?
But when you start drinkin' shit, it'd be workin'
I'm hooked, well, I was, cause, yo, it's the best
But if every time I drink I voyage through death
I leave it alone and just stick to tea
Cappucino was fly, but too fly for me

Why, oh why did I need Cappucino?
Cappucino
Why, oh why did I need Cappucino?
Cappucino

Why, oh why? Why, oh why?
Why, oh why did I need Cappucino?
Cappucino, Cappucino
Cappucino, Cappucino

It was a caf? On the west side
It was a caf? On the west
It was a caf? On the west side
It was a caf? On the west

M: Naaah! He try to be fly
Yo G Rap how you feel about how girls just be on yours
Cause you got a fonkee car?]

A convertible Porsche is what I'm striving to drive
DJ Polo of course, drives a ride that's live
With a AMG kit, in his pockets a mitt
And if you try to steal his shit, by a pitch you get bit
But yo one day you will see me in a fly Lamborghini
On my way to the beach picking up girls in bikinis
I'm a hip-hop star and yo I'm bound to go far
And all the girlies jump right on it
When you drive a dope car

[G Rap: Yo Polo man, let's call up Marley up on this car phone though

Operator: Your call cannot be completed at this time

Cars
Dope car]

Yo I see cars driving by me looking milky and shiny
Tires made from Pirelli getting all of the heinies
Now a few of my friends they drive a Mercedes Benz
All the seats are stitched and hemmed, MCM and gold rims
The people are looking, all the ladies are hooking
All the cops get shooken, suckers' girlfriends get tooken
Candy-apple Corvette, Benzy Boss in effect
And you know you get respect cause they're breaking their necks
To see your car

[The dope car (x2)
Yo, cars
The dope car
Dope cars][Intro]
(Nothing can save ya
Nothing can save ya
Nothing can save ya
*scratched* Nothing)

Just throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
Keep 'em there
Yo, run the jewels, run the jewels, run the jewels

(Can you feel it)

[Verse 1]
I used to be rollin like a millionaire
Cash in a flash, bankroll to spare
Homeboys hangin, champagne and girls
Got my main woman Diamonds, my mistress Pearls
Everybody laughin at my corny jokes
I was stupid; I thought that they were sincere folks
It turned out they liked the money and the fame
If I ain't get paid, I'd be that nobody James
The nobody, who dreamed about bein somebody
Chief rocker at the party
And they was hangin like, "Yo, I'm your man
I don't even care about the ring on your hand"
We'd go out to eat and chill
But they would go to the bathroom when it was time to pay the bill
I didn't notice all the chuckles and laughter
Too busy with a female tellin me I'm the master
I was slick like, "Huh, do I know you?
I got play, here, let me show ya"
Used to have a girl that was on the ball
When the cash flow got low, so did her calls
Used to have a homeboy, always chillin
My cash went low, he told me I was illin
And don't call cause he don't hang with derelicts
Broke with no cash, yo, I was in the mix
Everybody stepped cause my pocket wasn't fat
My girl got a new man, I fixed his flat
I'm the one that they're laughin' at
They say, "Cheesy rat, you ain't all that"

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I mean crabbin, played out by backstabbin; I feel like tiein
A anchor to my ankle and jumpin right in the ocean
Cause I'm ashy and I can't afford lotion
So-called friends in the jewelry store
Told me, "Todd, come back when you get off tour"
Souped as hell, I really regret it
Now the only thing I got in my pocket is bad credit
How can a man like me
Be walkin around in a world of misery?
And if women like a man with a body, it's not mine
Cause they be walkin past me like I'm a stop sign
My homeboys laugh when they pass the forty
Sayin, "Todd, as if he used to have a sporty"
The Benz was slammin, the Jeep was pumpin
Ain't that somethin?
I just laugh, this isn't what I was raised for
When I walk away, it's like ain't this a
Kick in the rear, that I'm standin here
And can't afford a tissue for my tear
Should I drink wine and brandy
Or get a job puttin stripes on candy
Or put a hole in donuts?
Cause when you're broke, your middle name is "so-what?"
I had to learn in an incredibly fast way
When you ain't got no money they treat you like an ashtray
I pawned all my jewelry and clothes
Right after that, I got dissed by all the hoes
That I thought was mine, but really never was
Soon the whole neighborhood got the buzz
That my tank was on "E", and that means empty
That Twinkie looks good, so mister don't tempt me
Everybody thought I was trippin
I rode the back of the bus, but my grip kept on slippin
I'm the man that they're laughin at
They say, "Cheesy rat, you ain't all that"

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I wanna hang with my man like, "Let's do this"
But this man like "Who this?"
That's right, the brother got two faces
They got me puttin the tips on shoelaces
P on the Puma, a mop and a bucket
My motto is... I don't care
I don't give a damn, so what, why try?
I might as well rob some Blake Carrington sucker for his money
It's so funny
Cars ride by with the boomin system
Sayin, "Leave him alone, my man already dissed him"
Now I'm on the cheeseline, poverty-stricken
As the red tape thickens
I go to the park, they wanna baseball-bat me
I go to the mall, they throw my old tapes at me
I'm so horny
And every girl I know be like, "He's so corny"
I want money in a hurry
I'm gettin tired of leftover curry
I wanna fall off, but I don't know where the edge is
I'm so hungry, I eat my neighbor's hedges
Now I realize I gotta go for mine
It's windshield time
I take quarters, pennies, dimes and nickles
And a kiddy's tricycle
I'm a desperado
"I'ma steal your rims" is my motto
I watch wrestlin until I'm dizzy sore
So if you're cashin your rent check, know how to get busy
Go to the drive-through, run with a milkshake
Go to the supermarket, pocket a raw steak
I need beer
I'mma catch the Miller truck out there
You know how they throw, the newspapers in the morning
The owner don't want em
I'm the man that they're laughin at
They say, "Cheesy rat, you ain't all that."

[Hook]

[Outro]
So yo, one more time, one more time
Party people in the house tonight

Just throw your hands in the air
And wave em like you just don't care
Keep em there
Run the jewels, run the jewels, run the jewels[Verse 1]
Immortal Technique, disintegrates mics when I spit
I cause more casualties than sunken slave ships
Full to capacity, I bring tragedy to rap without my man Khadafi
The government took Nazi scientists from Germany
To design nuclear rockets and ways of observin' me
Cause heir pathetic attempts, didn't work to murder me
When this country was conceived, these bastards never heard of me
But now I hold the souls of slave masters eternally
Bleeding internally, burgundy, during surgery, verbally
Cause I'm a spirit to which devils are incompatible
I've been around since the planet was inhabitable
I spit in the ocean and created microscopic animals
Which evolved into two species, the righteous and the cannibals
But until then, I had alien women suck me off
When God said "Let there be light", I turned it the fuck off
And that's the reason Earth is only 5 billion years old
I made the sun shine, and permitted time to unfold
The surface was lava, but when I stepped down, it became cold
Fuck what you've been told
My spiritual form became a swarm of molecule sickness
Manifested liquid trapped inside a mountainous region
Until the sky started raining, continuous seasons
Immortal Technique, at long last, reincarnated
Un-debatably reinstated to leave you decapitated
Je suis fou, but my crazy words make sense
I'll split every pound in your body into six pence
I'm sick of simple similes about The Sixth Sense
I'll leave your body drenched in the blood from all your ancestors
You'll never be at peace, like the souls of child molesters
I'll cut you and bless your festering wounds with alcohol
Drown you in a clogged toilet, in a public bathroom stall
I'll rip you down, take a chunk of you home like the Berlin Wall
This is the final call, for all rappers that wanna brawl
Immortal Technique, the wrong motherfucker to diss
Cause I allowed God to let you motherfuckers exist

[Verse 2]
I'm the Stronghold on your neck that doesn't let you breathe
Stronger than the fake image of God in which you believe
More dangerous than your ignorant ass could ever perceive
A European virus, mutated in Africa, overseas
Transported by mosquitoes and fleas to where you live
So lock yourself in your house with your wife and your kids
You're such a bitch, somebody probably made you out of a rib
My arrest record just scratches the surface of what I did
My bid locked me up and brought my life to an end
I was forgotten, abandoned by my bitches and friends
You don't want beef with people like me, so don't pretend
I'll resurrect your aborted baby and kill it again
You get no props in hip-hop like feminine men
I'm iller than any plague God gave Moses to send
You wanna make amends, cause I'm the reason that the earth shakes
Buryin' your fam like Central American earthquakes(Aiyyo calm down, fall back!
Y'all Queensbridge always fightin up in here!)

[Marley Marl]
Ladies and gentlemen, we got Queensbridge Finest up in this mothafucker
Tonight
They just came from war
They wanna let you know a little something about where they come from

"The-the Bridge" "Queensbridge" "The-the Bridge"

[MC Shan]
You love to hear the story, again and again
About a rap dynasty that just won't end
The monument, still in your face
Niggas played out, Shan still in the place
Hip hop was set out in the dark
The Bridge was never Over, we left our mark
The jam is dedicated to you and your boys
I brought my Queensbridge thugs to +Kill That Noise+

[Havoc]
If you was an out-of-towner, had to know somebody wit strength
You know the drill, shit was real, fuck around, got killed
You know the Hill breed of thugs, death to those that squeal
Squeezin them slugs, one love to thugs that died in the field
So many names don't got time to spit em, but through my rhymes they livin
We the Bridge through tracks I'm givin
Never lose sight, 41st Side's my life
The 40th Side of life, dunn we keepin it tight

[Cormega]
Yo it ain't just the music
Hoop aspirations or ghetto illusions
It's the product, east side, and all the beautiful children
And unleashed dreams comin through each building
If you sleep, you better wake up as you see
Mega more mature, I'm on a record wit Nature
Mind on my paper, nine in my waist
There's no denyin the greatness
Queensbridge, never try to disgrace it

[Millennium Thug]
Aiyyo the Queensbridge associations breeds similarity
Bricked up, chipped off rocked out salaries
Pull out long guns, pop out casualities
It's like I gotta see a thug nigga ill as me
The Ill Will in me, I rep that willingly
Step back enemies, death tracks feelin me
Six blocks, losin my mind
Runnin from D's
These P's got me usin my nine, I pop off

[Nature]
Y'all know the place where stars is from
Every night it sparks off and the crowds'll run
We leave chicks strippin over strollers (Slippin Sova)
In Queens, you be the victim till you get to know us
Your hood's bogus, my hood be keepin it crunk
So much be jumpin off I ain't sleep in a month
Y'all can play the front line, I be deep in the cut
Drive through, you can't peep it enough
You in the Bridge nigga

[Capone]
You must pay homage to my projects
We thorough to the end
Only jail and death divide us
From rap to the crack suppliers
Out-of-towners get knocked off
We regualte blocks laws
I had the hood like Watts flooded wit cop force
QB to the cracks in the pavement
Mister Everything that ? pool for stacks in a basement
Niggas understand the drama we bring
The legacy, dynasty upholding the ring where QB is king, what!

[Tragedy]
Yo for you I take a fifth to the head till I url
Boomerang dunn, QB bust they gun
Keep them PC niggas on the run, one
Mahti specialist, 2-5 the nemesis
The last verse, "T.O.N.Y." remember this
Resurrect through the birth of my seed, crime genetic
You synthetic, your gangsta's cosmetic
I move niggas telekinetic, who wanna set it

[Prodigy]
Yo yo move...
Me and my dogs comin through
We the grain, go against us you feel pain
Get rained on, we beat niggas numb
These niggas is dumb, you can't resist my dunns
2001 we still thump, the fuck happened to ya'll?
We like that snowball, goin downhill
We get large, you get bullets lodged
In your jaw, your ribs, your arms
We party hard, at the bar
Buyin bottles of overpriced styles and Remy Mar'n
The Head Niggas In Charge
We number one, QB there's no competition
Infamous Records, Bars and Hooks listen
Littles, Noyd, and Mega
We independent, dunn we Infamous Mobbin
G.O.D., Nitty and Twin in
The Ill Will Bravehearts, L.E.S. millennium

[Nas]
Yo blow faces, fo-fo blazes, no one's safe
This music mogul rollin wit a hundred soldiers
Gangstas we postal
Oh you didn't, wanna know whose life Was Written
The life I'm livin
The ice the women
The kites that sendin to lifeless biddin
The streets to prison
I touch you then buck you
Heats be spittin
La-ser, AR fifteen doors come down
Jaws is broke, your whole crew is coffin bound
Your ho, your man, lieutenant, your boss get found
This dough I got, I spend it and toss around
New York it's time we flip it, where you from?
Ladies, it's time we flip it, where you from?
Now tell me who was the true thugs in videos first?
Who had the projects behind us, who bit it the worst?
We from the largest project, yo the biggest on earth
Queensbridge know they history, left y'all cursed cuz

I'm droppin science

[Verse 1]
When I get stupid to the point that I'm mentally mad
My rhymes start to flow, so I simply must brag
About my style that makes you vibrant, I keep drivin
Until the song turns me to a hip-hop giant
Me and Marley Marl, we're goin one on one
For any sucker rapper that chooses to come
And for me Craig G a/k/a The Kingpin
I drop science, can't you tell how I'm singing?
They hate how I tie my mic cord to a whip
Suckers just have to flip cause I'm so hip
Craig G and Marley Marl, we form the ultimate alliance
No sucker can deal when I'm droppin science

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Rappers: Ask yourself the same question
Why am I best in this profession?
Is it because you're scared to step to me, yo
Or the things Marley does in the studio?
I drop science as if I was Butterfingers
And I know there's not another singer
In this lifetime to kick the right rhyme
Cause there's not another rhyme quite like mine
And when it comes to havin showmanship
I really don't care who you go and get
Cause rappers hate me, I'm so defiant
And I can get stupid just by droppin science

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Livin larger than life, and what this means is
We'll be the dopest duo comin outta Queensbridge
Now crews hate us cause we're extraordinaire
For you to beat us? Hm, I think that's sort of rare
These rhymes are dope, that's how I transmit
And sized perfectly, so that they can fit
You're steppin to us? You need traction
Or you'll be another sucker missin in action
You hate to hear it? You'll learn to love it
My smokin rhymes, you always think of it
I eat MC's up like a pack of hungry lions
So step out my way, I'm droppin science

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
The Vernon Posse along with me Craig G
Is gonna rock it till the crowd begs me
To kick the next verse, your context's worse
Like all the others, that's why I get respect first
And believe me, I'm never on on others
Cause as a member of Cold Chillin'/Warner Brothers
I do swear to uphold this
Title of rap to be the boldest
Among so many MC's
Yo Marley, yo we outta here?
(Yo money, let's breeze)
Alright

[Hook](I don't even remember how this happened)

(The Crew will not understand it)

(Duck Alert)
(Yee-ee-aah)
(Duck Alert)
(Yee-ee-aah)

(The Crew will not understand it)

[Verse 1: Craig G]
Yo, this jam is dedicated to you, boy, just listen
Take off your coat, get in a fit position
Cause I'm about to burn you at 450 Fahrenheit
You're jealous of the crew, that's why you're staring, right?
Forget the answer, the situation's obvious
When this is over, let's see who feels the sorriest
You'll be like, "Damn Craig, why did you play me, yo?"
And then you realize we're top in rap radio
Cause it's no game, boy, you can't do work
Marley, please tell us his name (Duck Alert)

(Has your crew suddenly become interested in promoting a war?)

[Verse 2: Craig G]
Now our crew is broken down into a large amount of channels
And not one of us can you handle
On the mic Magic, on the tables Marley
And when it comes to bein dope, don't ask: are we?
Cause our style is different, or should I say irregular?
And if you wanna get all hype, I'll have to settle ya
By pulling out my 12-gauge shotgun
And if you wanna go rhyme for rhyme, I got some
Dope rhymes for sure, or should I say galore?
But I won't sound old-schoolish, in other words foolish
I have a question now: who feels hurt?
Marley, do you have the answer? (Duck Alert)
Thank (yee-ee-aah)

(Duck Alert)
(Yee-ee-aah)

(What happened between us, was for us alone)

(Yee-ee-aah)
(Duck Alert)

(I am speaking to you from the Bridge)

(Yee-ee-aah)
(Duck Alert)
(Yeeeeeeh)

[Verse 3: Craig G]
After this, I hope you get someone to battle me
But make sure this person has originality
That's right, original, yeah, you heard me
I don't want his beats sounding like Hurby's
Oops -- I mean Marley, cause Hurb's a beat-biter
I don't know where the both of you get the right to
Come in the industry, steal someone's property
And some of you from it start clocking g's
Now that's not fair, Marley's the rightful owner
Yet you still treat him like he's a blood-donor
So now it's time to have revenge to all you jerks
Especially who, Marley? (Duck Alert)
That's right

(Yee-ee-aah)
(Duck Alert)

(I am speaking to you from the Bridge)

(Yee-ee-aah)
(Duck Alert)
(Yee-ee-aah)

(You're from where?)

[Verse 4: Craig G]
Um - at the final stage, cut the scratches
Marley Marl? I think no one can match his
Cutting ability on the 1200s
And many listeners, they often wonder
(Yo man, was that a tape?!) Nah, never in a milion years
You see, the liveness gives us the feeling we're
Being accepted as true entertainers
And it will stay that way for the remainder
Of the century, that's how it's meant to be
You don't believe me? You will eventually
Because the situation, boy, you can't divert
Especially who, Marley? (Duck Alert)
Ah-haChill
(Eat em up, L)
Chill
(Eat em up, L)
Chill
(Eat em up, L)
Chill
(Eat em up, L)

[ VERSE 1 ]
Bring on the mo's and ho's
Don't snooze or doze
Cause I'm rippin up shows
Hold your nose, dead bodies are around
I leave scratch marks under the tears of a clown
I write rhymes that shine like lipstick
So much material, but not materialistic
Imperial styles I use
When the mic is lifted the crowd is amused
Come with it, if you feel you're full-fledged
Or yell "Geronimo!" and jump off the edge
Your e-n-d is near when I appear
The stage is yours, but wait until the smoke clears
Rhyme sayer, and I'm here to lay a load
So watch a player when he's playin in player mode
Uncle L's bad, and you're soon to say
Cause I rip the mic until the toon decay

Chill
(Eat em up, L)
Chill
(Eat em up, L)
Chill
(Eat em up, L)
Chill
(Eat em up, L)

[ VERSE 2 ]
MC's are dumb, I catch em in a dragnet
You're not complete, I'm battlin a fragment
So creative and witty and outstandin
And I be demandin that you're abondoned
In the desert or a wild west town
While I'm at your crib on a cherry-go-round
Where will she stop? No one knows
Like I said before, bring on the mo's and ho's
I know my abc's and my p's and q's
Just chill and listen to the rhyme cruise
All aboard, the cod is a reward
Some were ignored when they toured for they bored
The crowd was aloud, lyrics weren't endowed
Took a crack of the 40 and went to show em how
You like me now, but you didn't before
Cause you forgot I was raw
Chill
(Eat em up, L)
Chill
(Eat em up, L)
Chill
(Eat em up, L)
Chill
(Yo, eat em up, L)

Ah

Future of the funk, ah

(Go 'head, baby)

Go 'head, baby

[ VERSE 3 ]
It's so visual the way I'm throwin down
Visualize MC's goin down
In a barrage of bullets combinated with rhymes
The moral of the story is: I'mma get mines
I saw the cord-less, boy, I'm gonna house that
Your rhymes are cheesy, you found em in a mouse trap
Don't try to front while the freestyle's droppin
He wants to battle, he must be needle-poppin
You better notify your next akin
Cause when I begin it's like a needle to the skin
If you wasn't prepared
Then you ought to be scared
But even if you was
You're aware what the rhyme does
I remember when you was an amateur
Writin your rhymes, starin at my signature
Bought the album, analyzed the style
Tisk-tisk (Hatchew!) God bless you, child
I'm unique when I speak to a beat
Another rapper'll fall when the mission's complete
I daze and amaze, my display's a faze
Every phrase is a maze as Uncle L slays
The competition that's lost in a freestyle
Cause on the mic I'm the golden child
With the magical wand that they're callin a mike
And when MC's approach it turns into a spike

Chill
(Eat em up, L)
Chill
(Eat em up, L)
Chill
(Eat em up, L)
Chill
(Eat em up, L)
Why don't you just chill
(Eat em up, L)

Yeah

Yeah
I wanna say what's up to my man Kool Herc
And my man Afrika Bambaataa and the Zulu Nation
Know what what I'm sayin
My man Marley Marl and DJ Clash
My man B-Blast
Rush Town
Def Jam
We in the house
Of course I gotta say what's up to my homeboys EPMD
Yeah
I get busy
Peace(Hey man, don't you realize
In order for us to make this thing work, man
We've got to get rid of the pimps, and the pushers, and the prostitutes?)

Ba-ha-ha-ha...
Yes, yes, y'all

[ Cool J ] Ah, ah
That's funky
[ Marley Marl ] Yeah
Hey yo, Marley, man
[ Marley Marl ] Yo, what's up, man?
[ Cool J ] Hey yo, man
You know
We was gettin busy on the album everyday
We been gettin funky, but
I wanna take this jam back to Farmers
Knowmsayin?
[ Marley Marl ] Yo, let's go back on Farmers
And get some of them early MC's
You used to be kickin it with back in the day?
[ Cool J ] Yeah, yeah, yeah
[ Marley Marl ] Yo, let's do a jam with them
[ Cool J ] Aight, bet
But first I gotta like introduce it
Youknowmsayin?
[ Marley Marl ] Aight, kick it...

(Farmers Boulevard)

[ L.L. Cool J ]
Back in the days, before I was Cool J
I used to hang up on the corner, pumpin' games people play
Sittin' on a garbage can, rhymin' to my man
Talkin' bout big money and future plans
I always told the brothers, if I got a contract
When the money started flowin', I'd be back
To do a jam, against all odds
Introducing rapper 1 from Farmers Boulevard

[ Bomb ]
Hey yo, B-o-m-b, bomb explosion
Attack like a cat when I'm trapped and I'm closed in
Sharp-ass claws, and I break all laws
In a while all jaws, cause I'm perfect, no flaws
Now I'm back to Farmers on some new improved
(Sh...) I'm makin moves, not fakin moves
So don't you never come around here, talkin that talk
Or walkin that walk, you'll get played like a sport
Football, soccer, whatever you savor
You're a tramp and a pussycat, ready for labor
Ha! L'll have you breakin' locks
I'll have you cookin fried rice in a big steel box
The type of skills that I got reigned for years
No worry or cares, your crew'll shed tears
'Hip-hip-hooray, he's back!' Yo, save the cheers
Suckers, I'm drinkin forties of beers
On the Boulevard

[ Cool J ] Funky, funky, funky rhymes bein' said here
[ Marley Marl ] Hey yo, hey yo
Hey yo Uncle L, let's go...
[ Cool J ] Yeah man, I wanna check out my man Big Money Grip
Yo, what's up, man
Kick a little somethin'

[ Big Money Grip ]
Kick out the can and slam
Summertime, C.I.A. step into the jam
Reach for the mic, and the punks start to fold up
And the brothers start fleein' like it's a hold-up
Some step aside, but a few play me close
Never worry, cause the brother who cross me's gettin buried
And the fool who wants to deal with another dose
I see to it in a hour that the mutha...'s comatose
Farmers Boulevard, the place
Handin me a mic is like givin' a chainsaw to Leatherface
Smokin MC's in an instant
At my side bustin caps is T-Boogie, my assistant
Throw that speaker in the trash
Why's that? Cause Gangster Boogie gave the woofer a gash
Big Money Grip makin you get up
Farmers Crew's in effect, we never heard of a head-up

[ Marley Marl ] Yo, yo, yo
It's kinda funky out here on the boulevard, yo
[ Cool J ] Yeah, we livin' Chinese people in a Turkish bath, baby
[ Marley Marl ] Hi C over there, man
[ Cool J ] Yo, what's up Hi C...

[ Hi C ]
Hi C on the scene, at last to bust a funky rhyme
More than a line on time, because I'm gettin' mine
Never underestimate the skill of a great one
The Boulevard Lord, shorts, never take none
Another funky rapper from around the way
Leavin' bodies at a party, cause somebody gotta pay
Boy, you been told, put your lips on hold
All you remember is a barrel and a mouth full of gold
Spreadin' terror on the street like they was in the past
Any punks on the block, yo, never could last
And I never feel sorry for a sucker I gained on
Any slick talker, yo, he's bound to get rained on
At any Farmers party at my side is a Mag
(One time a sucker got ill and went out in a bodybag)
Fear will erupt through the heart of another
The Farmers Crew will never fall, that's word to the mother

[ Marley Marl ] Yo, yo
It's kinda funky out here
Yo, yo, yo, Hi C
Yo man, y'all kinda funky out here, yo
I was -
Yo, what's up?
[ crew member ] ...9 years ago, man
Youknowmsayin?
[ Cool J ] Farmers Boulevard, baby
[ Marley Marl ] Yo, I was kinda -
I was kinda stagnant to sleep on it
But yo, L
Won't you - won't you sum it all up for the people, aight?
[ Cool J ] Aight, let me sum this up

[ L.L. Cool J ]
Now you heard the brothers speakin 'bout the street that we're from
Rhymes hittin', beats kickin', you can't get none
F-A-R-M-E-R-S passin' the test
Marley Marl in the background doin the rest
Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do, do-ti-la-so-fa-mi-re-do, Kato
Get up out my face before I play you like Play-Doh
I did a jam against all odds
And it was dedicated to Farmers Boulevard

(Farmers Boulevard)

Keep on

(Farmers Boulevard)

To the beat, y'all
A funky beat, y'all
Yes, yes, y'all
You don't stop
