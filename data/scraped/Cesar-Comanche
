[Phonte]
I came from the bottom of the barrel
No name brands, no logo's on my apparel
Played out like a Blue Note, just ask Harold
Hard times and then some
A broken home, with a fixed income
Until I started puttin' words together
Adjectives and verbs together, and put them to beats
Records labels hear my sounds, say me shit sounds sweet
And so they throw me on the road for a couple of weeks
So the world can hear my devilish raps
California, New York, New Orleans, Philly, Texan and back
The delicate fact
Is that they show me all these chicks and doe
And I ain't never had this shit before
So I'm wildin', snortin', smokin' cancer sticks
And fuckin' these groupie hoes every chance I get
Supermodels, gettin' next to them
And catchin' ease ass from white broads cause that's safe sex to them
Now I
Travel the world and my records been played
And people tellin' me, that hip hop's been saved
And on the
Finest of linen's my head's been laid
But I get home and find none of my bills been paid?!
And that's part of the game, you gotta respect it
Niggas don't see the lights, till it's disconnected
And that can have a sobering effect
It's the rap life
But nigga, that shit can all be over in a sec
Better live it[Background]
Keep going man
So no matter what

[Intro: Cesar talking]
You know...life is funny sometimes. You got your good times and your bad. Regardless...no matter what...you gotta fight through that shit. Word up


[Verse One: Cesar]
You know life is non stop building a strong case
You were moving up now you getting the long face
Soon as you get up, be on search for your own space
It was feeling right now you stuck in the wrong place
No free cheese in this rat race
Ain't no [?] or Stuart Little's that swam in life's little puddles
The innocent rebuttals cause
You know life ain't circling in huddles, it's real, it's never subtle
So find your mom and cuddle brah
Highs and lows too much for ya
Slow down, stick with the kiddie rides
Some dreams live
Some dreams they really die
So dig in and get teary eyed if ya want it
Some defeat their pride and some need to flaunt it
If your hot well I'm southern fried
Lacking herbs or mad spices
That best at presenting me
Reach goals cause I really tried

[Hook: Cesar]
It goes up with the flame and soars
It comes down, when it rain it pours
Good to know it and you can't control it
So roll with punches, just roll with the punches
Those times when you win are sweet
It's bad when you taste defeat
Good to know it and you can't control it
So roll with punches, just roll with the punches

[Verse Two: Cesar]
You know time, works in cycles baby
You jump the gun if you quick to say we
Can't get a break or you can't delay we
There's a left turn you can't see coming up
Don't waste your days of life running up
With your palms up to the sky asking "Why?"
Just keep a mind shower today, destine to dry off
Keep on running and that [?] will fly up
To the top of the trees
Trip, fall, put knots in your knees
Brush off, react to the breeze
Sit, wait till water to freeze
And you see it's way too late, hands are tied up
Even then
You got to wiggle and fight
Till you're sliding your wrist just a little
Only natural now
Then you're gonna be pissed
Stay shaking your fist, it's a riddle

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Eternia]
15, out on your own without a home to
Lay your head, no red clothes or phone too
Without a plan B, now you exposed to the elements
It's frightening, it's Canada and cold too
No one you're close to so use your intelligence
Irrelevant, the situation is what you make of it
Now that you got that freedom, it's time to live a bit
Love what you do and you must cause you living it
Ill right?
You breaking down stereotypes
The high school dropout that excelled on the mic
Excelled in the classes, excelled in the life
You can tell that I'm talking about myself when I write
But you hitting the ceiling, you gonna fall down
What goes up, yo you know how the saying sounds
Ain't no way around it, life is just a downpour
Be sure to maintain, remain and enjoy

[Hook][Verse 1: Bekah]

I've got so many things on my mind
Sometimes I don't know where to start
I'm finding it hard to make the time
To make shit happen and get on my grind
So now it's all up to you
You need to make the first move
From here on it's only getting better
Big change, big moves, it's all coming together

[Hook: Bekah]

This is my beautiful struggle
I know what I gotta do
This is my beautiful struggle
I'm doing this just for you yeah yeah

[Verse 2: Cee]

Yo, nowadays I gotta hustle
Coz working 18 hour days on the daily is not enough dude
I got big dreams, that damn it, I'mma live up to
And I believe in me, coz homie you gotta trust you (yes sir)
I'm feeling guilty when I'm sitting doing nothing
So I'm keeping busy, grinding, with no time for the TV and man
I'm working 40 plus hours a week
In a job that ain't take me where I'm needing to be
So I, stay in the lab, making advance
Saving my cash and still getting baked with the lads
And I'm taking the chance, ain't tryina be living miserable
Big Cee, the dude, most driven of individuals
Yeah, it's so difficult to keep my cool dog
Focusing on the plan even when shit get too hard
What, I still fuck with it, struggle's all a part of it
And this is my life, my passion and man I'm lovin' it coz

[Hook: Bekah]

This is my beautiful struggle
I know what I gotta do
This is my beautiful struggle
I'm doing this just for you yeah yeah

[Verse 3: Cesar Comanche]

And it's far from finished, when you in this business
Illest ways, you gotta fight for whatever you got
Finished days can turn to night if you're ready or not
There ain't no option to falter or stop
Any second your bubble could pop
You develop a jail record or nobody considers you hot
Tiny tots inherit the right method
But the rest of us gotta make it work or we destined to rot
God bless, put you to the test, lest that you know
Could be the rationale to lest that we grow
Certain cat took his time to be his best as a pro
Gotta polish your flow, and the bills you pay depends on the show
To forgone what you planned to say
When the time for sleep's only goes away
For a strength, you walk a pail to pray
Great you holding on, could begin to flay
So I can't be long, coz the struggle, great beauty is here to stay

[Hook: Bekah]

This is my beautiful struggle
I know what I gotta do
This is my beautiful struggle
I'm doing this just for you yeah yeah[Verse One: Cesar Comanche]
You know I would be back only the fit survive
[?] for your boy without a nine to five
For this shit you can derive
Better beats, better words, better songs and I'm along for the ride
Some of my dearest compadres
Kinda like my sisters and brothers from different madres
Seeing the illest nights and the long days will tell you that
Comanche's worth [?] pays off
A lot of rap crews get laid off
Because
Lyrics are not enough
Beats ain't up to stuff
So Squirrel and the Aces made but also tough to reach
Messed up, your get graded curve
But still putting shit out so that shows a lot of nerve
[?] sounds so sweet
And the rap cats display, translate the heat
Don't sleep
You'll miss why they're preferred

[Interlude: Cesar talking]
Yeah, this is album number three. Squirrel and the Aces. So you know it's time. Yeah. It's a party y'all. C'mon

[Hook 1: Cesar] {x4}
Let's groove
Let's groove with it

[Verse Two: Median]
Hok a loogie on this here, hit 'em with the thick spit
Pitch down the middle, you get it just how we givin' it
With all the trimmings and them fringe benefits
Stay bustin' them door down, we let ourselves in here
Back in this biznitch, we so felt in here
Hot off the presses, this is fresh no iddich
So serious, no kiddin'
Squirrel came through with them Ace dudes
Embrace the crew
J-League
Thought you wasn't gon' see me?
On the low with J-Lizzy, I'm the O.D.B
Reporting for duty
I'm so unruly
Median, but really at times I'm so Moody
Lacing them 9th joints with flows so gooey
The blessing of my essence leave resin on your present
Kept in contact, get the method
But dig it
One whiff of this spliff here, you swear it's the Method

[Hook 2: Cesar]
Squirrel and the Aces come to your town it's like
All of the faces gather around at night
We bring the Jews and the Gentiles
Defendants at mistrials
And [?] there ain't no need to fight

[Hook 1][Verse 1: Bekah]

I've got so many things on my mind
Sometimes I don't know where to start
I'm finding it hard to make the time
To make shit happen and get on my grind
So now it's all up to you
You need to make the first move

[Hook: Bekah]

This is my beautiful struggle
I know what I gotta do
This is my beautiful struggle
I'm doing this just for you yeah yeah[Phonte]
I came from the bottom of the barrel
No name brands, no logo's on my apparel
Played out like a Blue Note, just ask Harold
Hard times and then some
A broken home, with a fixed income
Until I started puttin' words together
Adjectives and verbs together, and put them to beats
Records labels hear my sounds, say me shit sounds sweet
And so they throw me on the road for a couple of weeks
So the world can hear my devilish raps
California, New York, New Orleans, Philly, Texan and back
The delicate fact
Is that they show me all these chicks and doe
And I ain't never had this shit before
So I'm wildin', snortin', smokin' cancer sticks
And fuckin' these groupie hoes every chance I get
Supermodels, gettin' next to them
And catchin' ease ass from white broads cause that's safe sex to them
Now I
Travel the world and my records been played
And people tellin' me, that hip hop's been saved
And on the
Finest of linen's my head's been laid
But I get home and find none of my bills been paid?!
And that's part of the game, you gotta respect it
Niggas don't see the lights, till it's disconnected
And that can have a sobering effect
It's the rap life
But nigga, that shit can all be over in a sec
Better live it[Verse One: Cesar Comanche]
