"Here's a bulletin from state police, Princeton Junction."

"The militia...
Certain individuals of unidentified nature
Is now under complete control"

"Hip-hop is not, what it is today.."

"It's the real *echoes*... it's the (militia)"

[Verse 1: Big Shug]
If heads only knew how I felt about the rap game
They'd relocate, and change their fuckin name
I eradicate movefakers, roll with coat shakers
Give dap to mad money makers
Shared cells with lifetakers, have sex with rumpshakers
I make moves so I'mma earthquaker
I've been known to instill fear
Although the world may be round, we still trapped in the square
City light, got me buggin and trife
Some die by the gun, some die by the knife
It's alright, like a game of spades I'm trump tight
Premier hit me with music to ensure that it thump right
And my flight, will be taken solely at night
Cause that's when the freaks come out, no doubt
And in the dark hours is when I will shower
With the knowledge of my trade to get paid
Still I make moves like a snake in the grass, roundabout
I be dickin it down while you be assed out
Puff mad L's but never passed out
And if I'm caught up in a jam I blast my way out
There'll be no lettin up, just straight shuttin up
Or we'll start the wettin up
Lyrical infrared sceptor never miss you
Big Shug, Guru, Freddie Foxxx, The Militia, militia

[Hook: Freddie Foxxx]
Everybody's spittin it, the rhyme is hot
Cause it's Big Shug, Guru, and Freddie the Foxxx
When Premier bring the beats, no it just don't stop
It's The Militia *echoes*

Chorus

[Verse 2: Guru]
Yo; I ain't one to succumb to no man, but to command
And scoop up the troops when it's time to take a stand
Emphatically, deep strategies leave casualties
I creep gradually, til everybody knows
That I got more flows than Rosebud got holes
The anger inside had me trapped
Til I got geared up with raps to tear you up like big gats
For big stacks, watch your back when I send em in
Caught you tremblin, my name and face you're rememberin
Several attempts, but nah bitch, you'll never win
Rhymes pierce your skin or maybe limbs we'll be severin
Take you to the mat, peep that, you should keep back
My ill-kid format will lay you flat like a doormat
That I walk on, I meditate while you talk on
And gossip, so I drop my hot shit; fully loaded Glock clips
So get the fuck out my block, kid
As nights turn to days, days go back to nights, we be speaking it right
And keeping it tight up in the street life
I meet life, head on, no holds barred
Born with a heart of gold, now mostly cold and scarred
En guard, choose your weapon, or get to steppin
Lyrical bullets make you dance from the trance you be kept in
Assessments are made before, and during combat
I master my hunger, blow the spot when I bomb cats
One of us, equals many of us
Disrespect one of us, you'll see plenty of us
Conflict, is what I predict
You and your fellas is mad jealous, attempting to flare
We cleverly stalked ya, your fam'll miss ya
The war's on, that's why we formed The Militia

Chorus

[Verse Three: Freddie Foxxx]
You niggas owe me for my rhymes, I come to collect
For you dope fiend niggas in rap, I here to inject, check
My style is butter baby, spread it around
But when you niggas don't flow it right and fuck up my sound
I get down; in '89 I spit a "buck" in the face
Of every MC that came in the place, a scar you'll never erase
MC's are only recognized for their flows
I'm worldwide for the bitches, that I turned into hoes
You heard me spit it on Jew-elz, that's how it goes
For all them faking ass niggas and how I bust up their nose
And while your, nose is drippin, and drainin blood
I'll be standing over you screamin, "Nigga, WHAT, WHAT?! Nigga WHAT?!"
Niggas feel my presence, like I'm right in their palm
Cause a stormy day is coming, when you see me so calm, it's on
No more twin Glocks, they jam up my plays
Now its twin .40 calibre Walther PPK's
I'm in the control of my game, you must respect me like The Ref
Uh-huh, you disrespect *gun clicks* you get the tech
I turn you fake niggas on and off, like I'm the clapper
I rob so many niggas, they should call me Jack the Rapper
I'll the illest nigga doing this, dead or alive
Gloria Gaynor on you motherfuckers, I Will Survive
You can try to come at me, but do you want the kick back?
You step inside the cage of a pit, and you get bit back, huh
My war is so tight, my drama so ill
Beef with me hangs around like a unpaid bill
I push these lyrics through any MC, and make it burn
So the niggas who be rhyming next, will miss a turn
When you speak of who's the dopest MC, I don't come up
But when you speak of who's the livest MC, I stay one up, what's up?
I got stripes like you got strikes and bogus mikes
Do what bitch niggas do best *UTFO sample* bite
Y'all niggas can't make up a law that I don't overrule, overthrow
Preem' brought Bumpy this track so I'mma let you know
Before I slide I'mma leave you this jewel
Even mechanics walk around with they tools
It's the Militia[DJ Premier]

[Big Shug]
First name vete-, last name -ran
I drop bombs hit you with the curse of Jevon
Broken arms, shattered glasses, whipped asses
I advise you to tell us where the cash is
Itchy fingers cause nothing but gun fire
We disallow all these cats in the camp
We the champs, not really to boast and brag
Bustin' heads, body bags and toe tags
Black mags to blow your whole chest in half
If you don't know the equation then you can't do the math
I know you cram to understand the plan, but you too
Caught up in the rapture, front and we will capture
See men and strap ya, cock back and blast ya
Blow up your fuckin' house while we still lookin' at ya
Militia man...man part three

While you fidget, you could get kill't for your digits
I'll creep on the low, keep it a secret yo
I swore an oath to dump on you, out the Jeep window
I don't care if you a geek or a thug, you sleepin' on us
And you could catch it, some royal heat from the snub
Since the streets is watchin' niggas might see us often
We told you rap cats we would keep it poppin'
See all I got is a lot of bad news for y'all
You're gonna need more than a lot of tattoos on y'all
You got an army, you still ain't got no wins against us
You're gonna need more than doo rags and Timb's against us
And fuck your goons cause we always get what we're after

There's one ripped out the frame, felony act
Everybody get the fuck up, welcome me back
I'm the unseen hand that controls 200 niggas
Pouring while on the street out of unseen vans
I'm the law of the land, the rawness of man
That'll show up on stage, puffin' on contraband
Capture, duct tape wrapped ya, slapped ya
Served up my Venus and Serenas, cocked back
Clapped ya - to Internet emcees I'm virus
I'm a warrior, niggas screamin' "Bumpy shot Cyrus"
I'm checked in to every hotel that you lay in
Niggas come to my suite to pick up heat
Y'all know who wrote the bible in rap, for keepin it real
Y'all know who buck fifty your face, I'm keepin it Seal
It's capture, get out the truck, I'm keepin' your wheels
Clapped ya, cause you've got a gun you never conceal
I leave my hardcore demeanor in every rap arena
And underground club that I play in
I spit raw verses that y'all ain't sayin'
Cause your soul was bought for what they payin'
You wanna have Bumpy's heart you got to have Bumpy's chest
I'll bust right 'till I find just Bumpy left
I'll bust mics 'till I have just enough breath
To take your heart, it's thug grand death
CAPTURE![Intro]
The three Shugs
MC, ghetto nigga, P-I-M-P, ya heard?

Yo Shug you there my nigga?

[Big Shug]
One two, one two yeah
It's all good nigga, yeah, yeah {*scratched: "one"*}

Whassup Duke, it's Big Shug again
Here to make money, fuck makin friends
Punches to the face, feel no ways
Call on your team, my 9 sprays
In this game, I'm pretty accurate
Immaculate, leave no mess
In through the back, out through the chest
Fuck you nigga, fuck family stress
Don't front, and I'll let you live
Don't lie, and I'll let you live
But your girl still swallow my kids
That's just the way it is, f'real
Who wish to du-el, for jew-els
Step up and get that ass kicked like a mu-el
I been there and done that
So all you got left to do, is run that

{*beat changes*} {*scratched: "two"*}

I run up in the spot, cock, two Glocks
I yell out, gimme the ki's, or the combo
P.O. back know
I squeeze off I let off, I plug him in the big toe
Now he tellin me the combo slow
I open up the safe, a whole lot of dough
I put it in the bag, quick I got to go
I hear sirens so I run mad low
Through the bushes to the getaway car
I put the pedal to the metal, to get mad far
I try to be discrete
But to the kids, I'm legendary in the streets
Shuggy Shug, I'ma put the guns down
I got a plane ticket, so it's first class outta town
My hustle remains strong
Live the life of money and women, and fly rap songs

{*beat changes*} {*scratched: "three"*}

Watch out, for Big Shug Daddy
Chicks sweat me, for the rims on my Caddy
I've been pimpin chickens for years
With no fears, cause I got the fly wears
Like diamonds rings and fur coats and things
All the riches, that the good pimpin brings
I check trap, attack weak rap
Player haters, stay mad at that
I need a franchise chick
One who dreams of mansions, not five dollar dicks
If you ready to work, then I'm ready to talk
Here's your chance, to start on the sidewalk
Live the life, of a high-priced mobster
Five pounds of shrimp, and ten pounds of lobster
And a bottle of Mo', to go
If anybody ask, you Shug Daddy's ho
So get in where you fit in
I know you smitten, by this fly pimp shit I'm spittin
So get money; no bullshittin
And when you come home we'll try five new positions
Whattup?[G-Squared scratches]
"Boston"
"Boston"
"Representin' mass"
"Boston"
"The worst" "Fuckin' Boston"
"Boston"

[Verse 1: XL]
We're from the B to the O-S-T-O-N
Where cats double push friends for dollars and gems
Platinum artistes they don't wanna come here (nah)
Not cause of lack of money or bitches, but out of fear
Rappers up here be gettin' overlooked for years
Started hatin' on eachother sabotagin' careers
Ten o' the best MC's we got to offer
To shut down you cock blockin' shit talkers

[Verse 2: Ed O.G.]
Mad niggas think they flossin' in rap
But no one knew Boston could rap
Till Edo put this shit on the map
Now the change is drastic, Hip-Hop got Jurassic
And none of you Boston bastards made a classic
Got the right voice, make the right noise
Can't stand none of you niggas and none of you white boys
My men's is down to take the city, hands down
From the ropes to Pakis all the way to Landsdown

[Verse 3: Big Juan]
How you gon' lie about the place that you're from?
The house you grow up in, the block that you hung
Politics ain't my fortay
You gettin' fucked without the foreplay
Heaven trouble comin' through the doorway
G ain't playin' you dubs in the clubs
And heads ain't showin' you no love in the Hub
Spend time on the road, hotel's all alone
Not for Hillstreet times ain't no place like home

[Hook: Guru](4x)
I'mma get home, I'mma get there
Make it back even if I'm caught outthere

[Verse 4: JaySon]
When I think of the Bean I think of the artist who
Got fucked over by Maurice Starr and Larry Wu
I think I-L-D, fifteen years of R & B transmitted outside Dudley
Plus the Bumrush specially celebrities
Aks Kane, Moe Dee, Mo Vaughn and Eric B
Murdapan, Deathchester and Glocksbury
The weed's extra sticky, coke's extra heavy

"Boston"
[Verse 5:Big Shug]
It's the chin checkin', Chuck chokin' predator
Boston rap (Big Shug) Murdapan settler (huh)
I'm bettin' the stakes be high, when you die
Diss the crew, and lose the sight in you eyes
We multiply to bring the real on the track
Cross the line and there ain't no goin' back (fuckin' fag)
In fact, these niggas will rip ya ass apart
Bury that head in Franklin and your body in Hyde Park

[Hook]

[G-Squared scratches]
"Boston"
"Boston"
"Representin' mass"
"Boston"
"Fuckin' Boston"

[Verse 6: G-Squared]
We make history daily
Represent Boston like Arabs and Israelis
Police tail me, backstabbers try to nail me
DJ's play me at the clubs past eleven
On 88.9, 94.5 and Hot97
Beantown's a cold city Dorchester gritty
Murdered over a fifty, hometown ain't it shifted
I travel the map but I always come back
To burn it down behind 24 tracks

[Verse 7: Krumb Snatcha]
Shoot outs fit niggas get twist in the Bean
Below the exploded magazine leave my head on the scene
Long time to Glocksbury twist your nine on the spot
Either you out to get this paper, or you work for the cops
My don stylo finally ya niggas know how it go
Most hated at the back with the gats at the show
Quick to die with the stripes on squeezing like a python
Half the industry ya already dead before the mic's on

[Verse 8: Akrobatik]
My rapstyle's changed like Rodman's head
It's Akrobatik representin' Codman Square (Hell yeah)
Where you can hop on the Red Line
And catch me at the Middle East
Wippin' hoes close to headline
The winter's east Stone Cold like Steve Austin
But I promise my heart will never leave Boston
And that's the bottom line cause Akro say so
Intimidatin' with my pitch changed up like Pedro

[Hook]

[Guru]
"Boston" Niggas be sleepin' on Boston for years
"Boston" I don't know what you thought
"Representin' mass" this ain't no fuckin' collegetown

From chains to whips
To chains and whips
Hopped off the slave ships into the fly kicks
Floss our ice, gettin' paper
All my niggas want paper
We just gotta get paper

The negro epidemic, black cream)
Black cream

[Verse One] [Reks]
Dear Oprah Winfrey
I know misogyny
Is rampant in our music and it pains you severely
But Dear Ms. Billion Dollar Income
Hear me
The path to success isn't merely:
Respect self, sincerely, remember Celie?
Slaved after mister
And when she disobeyed then he whipped her
Well we was picked up, broke down, whipped up
Said, "Thanks" to master when he tipped us
Upon tree, lift us
Noose as a necktie
Excuses, I guess I
Use cause I refuse to let my
Ego be abused by the stereotype
That blacks just might be better off as have nots
Than to have cops, harass us
Poor Jacqueline Onassis
Husband gunned down, supporting our black asses
We as poor folks frown upon a brother's success
The more he has, then we have less
And we have yet, been able to afford
Without buying the store
Instead of repair, get all the white Airs
Force 1/one to look in the mirror
And be ashamed as the truth appears
Nigga, negro, Afro, hero
To the youth who want to rhyme for deniro
And shine like them joints in the earlobes
The pain I've seen
Watchin' my people spend they black cream

[Hook] [Big Shug] (Reks)
From chains to whips
To chains and whips
Hopped off the slave ships into the fly kicks
Floss our ice, gettin' paper
All my niggas want paper
We just gotta get paper
(We bought your American Dream
The negro epidemic, black cream)
Black cream

[Verse Two] [Reks]
Everybody ain't Kanye West lord
I tell the kids, get a dream you can afford
But kids want stunts, smoke blunts and impress broads
Sip on syrup cause they idol got his cup
What this does
Is make it harder to give a fuck
The impulse
To ball got Cosby pissed off
That "buck that bought the bottle
Coulda struck the lotto"
To invest in scratch tickets is a fucked up motto
Dress our autos, barely dress our kids
Some want Tims, but he gon' wait
Daddy need new rims
Damn
Did I write that right?
Question is
Are you gonna right that wrong?
Put my mic back on
Free speech is tell a nigga 'bout a nigga's self
You poor knowledge even if you got dumb wealth
Poor knowledge?
Dumb wealth?
All the money in the world, your black ass can't spell help

Chains and whips to chains and whips
Right into the latest kicks
And we
Floss our ice
Brush off haters
Black man's plight
Lusting paper
(We just gonna get paper)
We bought your American dream
The negro epidemic, black cream
(Black cream)
"Black cream"

[Big Shug singing]
Heeeey
Stay on your grind baby
Brush off the haters
Remain a player
Gettin' this paper
Black cream, yeeeeah
Black cream, yeeeeah
Gettin' this paper
Gettin' this paper
Black cream

[Outro] [Big Shug talking]
Big Shug. Reks. This is how we get down man
Cats is fightin' for money out there
We gotta keep it movin' man. One way or the other. I'm out[Big Shug]
Yeah the motherfucking jig is up, niggah
Ha ha, I'm coming to get you fake-ass niggas
Word is bond..

It'll take more than what you got, to foil my plot
I be rocking you and socking you like killer robots
I'm too hot
But I refuse to cool down
'Till they rest my black ass
Beneath the ground, I get down
For my underground sound
Pushing lyrical weight niggah, by the pound, for real
I'm bringing sight to the visually impaired
Cause what you see in rap, ain't always too clear
(Yeah Y'all)
Ice-grill stares for those who create fantasies
Couldn't bust a grape, fighting you or fighting me
Hip-hop today is like a big magic show
One magician, and a whole bunch of shining' ho's
I'm trying to grow like my dick in the morning
It's a new day - matter fact a new fucking dawning
While you stretching and yawning, from your sleep
Shug done turned this whole shit back to the streets
Pumping the beat, when I was starving to eat
Now I push the ford truck
To extort the weak
Thought you broke away clean, I caught you
Now it's up to me to completely end you, for real
You hear shots, I bring shots
You smoke a lot of pot, and still spit weed talk, pussy
In '99 you get stepped to
Fuck your silly weak crew
And your mugged up boo, for real
No more faking jacks, or faking jills
We know all about those manufactured skills
Even chickens is spitting harder
Who's your ghost writer miss, Sean Carter?
Once again it's the militiaman stepping to Brooklyn
Coming straight out of Murder Pan
While I'm shitting on you spitting up
Letting you silly faggots know, the jig is up[Intro]
Yeah man, all I'm sayin is
Just play the music, play all of the music man
We gotta keep some balance in the game
You know? Let it play man, for real

Uuhuuh, Big Shug, Primo
You know the deal
Just play these records man, all of em
DJs, all around the world

[Verse 1]
This year, I'm not fuckin with coward cats
Who hide behind they raps and flashy Cadillacs
Scared of the battle raps and semiauto gats
But wanna push wack rhymes ____ official cats
Who wanna feel the purple haze and sparks with cattle graze
Swimmin pool with dime chicks, spendin happy days
With all my niggas, blaze, honey dips gets glazed
And I'm paid a hundred grand when I hit the stage
This is not a phase, its a real niggas wage
And I'mma make sure I get it before I'm back in the cage
I promise to shoot and blaze, till my dyin days
Till DJ stan and my musics played
Any beef with me will end in castastrophe
I'm winnin while you losin, thats how it just has to be
From the vinyl, to the cd j
Give the fans a chance to hear the fly shit I say
Play the record or get smacked clean
With anotha bangin joint from Big Shug and DJ Prim

[Hook 1]

(Play it) play it (play it) play it (play it) play it (play it) play it
(play it) play it (play it) play it
Let the music play, hey
(You know we get down)
Let the music play, hey
(On the microphone)
Let the music play, hey
(Rhymes flowin like water)
Let the music play, (hip hop) everyday
Let the music play, hey
(You know we get down)

(...record is massive evidence, of the flexibility and toughness of the
Principles you profess)

[Verse 2]
I do it all to show my skills, till pushin' daffodils
I be on the roof tops, accurate for the kill
From old school to new school dudes, I set the tone
I'm a vocal, crush and do other things to your bones
When I face my enemies, I creep like a centipide
Smoke that angel weed while I'm spittin that 16
The games been a hunch, referee true and lunch
I spit the hottest fire, and always pack a punch
Play the record or get your station smothered
Or get your head popped off like Saddam Hussein brother

[Hook 2]
Play it (play it) play it (play it) play it (play it) play it (play it) play
It (play it, play it, play it)
Let the music play, hey
(You know we get down)
Let the music play, hey
(On the microphone)
Let the music play, hey
(Rhymes flowin like water)
Let the music play, (hip hop) everyday
Let the music play

[Outro]
All I'm sayin DJs, around the world, let the music play man
All the music ain't got to sound the same
This is Big Shug, DJ Primo, what could be better?
Let that music play man, for real
Street champ, I'm gone{*"Boom bang 'em on down" - Jeru the Damaja*}
{*"Boom bang 'em... boom bang 'em on down"*}
{*"There's no cure.."*}
{*"Boom bang 'em on down"*}
{*"Boom bang 'em... boom bang 'em on down"*}
{*"Boom bang 'em..."*}

[Big Shug]
Puff thai, I got to elevate the mind
Come with the rough rhymes, each and every time
The lyrical's tight, and so is my game
I came to hang 'em high, and some might get maimed
Dangerous, not the one to trust
Itchy be my trigger finger if I have to I bust
Or touch, any MC who got the nerve
To step to Big Shug and get served, my word
You wanna know what I'm about?
Come a little closer, and I'll knock your fuckin choppers out
And I'll be laughin at your toothless ass
When your man run up, he catch a Heineken bottle blast
I'll be the one to take 'em down
Niggas be tryin to play but now Shug's in town
And I gots to crush 'em down
Limb by limb, cause I'm runnin my game again
Now I'm here... to rule again
Kickin faces in like a soccer hooligan
And I'm choppin cats down that are weak in the rap game
After I'm finished, the punks think I'm insane
No time to clown around
Like Green Bay we +Pack+, when we come to bang 'em down

{*"Boom, bang 'em, on down"*}

[Big Shug]
I slap up punks with a vengeance
I got hardcore rhymes, in each and every sentence
I mentioned, I like to box or go fencin
I'ma do you in punk, I got to pay my rent son
And I'll be crashin down on chumps
And in my left kick I might have the bag of skunk
Cause niggas be cryin in this game too much
So it's time for Big Shug, to fuck 'em up
Stuck 'em up, for they cash and respect
Now they lay motionless, with a broken neck
Put punks in check, Shug's on the set
Who'll be the next MC to wanna flex?
I'll leave you roughed up like bedsheets after sex
So if you comin kid, you best come correct
I attack yo when I'm low on dough
But I get paid nicely to rock fly shows
Goes to show, there's life for dope pros
If Shug don't see ya, you get the elbow
Or hear the tormenting sound
Of wack MC, getting smashed to the ground
I bang 'em down

{*"There's no cure.."*}
{*"Boom bang 'em on down"*}
{*"Boom bang 'em... boom bang 'em on down"*}
{*"Boom bang 'em... boom bang 'em on down"*}
{*"There's no cure.."*}

[Big Shug singing]
You're a mean one, you fuckin punk
You only talk shit when you're drunk
You think that you are bigger, when you drink that fuckin liquor
You fuckin puuuuuuuuuunk, I'll beat your assssssssss!"Black cream"

All the money in the world, your black ass can't spell help

Chains and whips to chains and whips
Right into the latest kicks
And we
Floss our ice
Brush off haters
Black man's plight
Lusting paper
(We just gonna get paper)
We bought your American dream
The negro epidemic, black cream
(Black cream)
"Black cream"

[Big Shug singing]
Heeeey
Stay on your grind baby
Brush off the haters
Remain a player
Gettin' this paper
Black cream, yeeeeah
Black cream, yeeeeah
Gettin' this paper
Gettin' this paper
Black cream

[Big Shug]
First name vete-, last name -ran
I drop bombs hit you with the curse of Jevon
Broken arms, shattered glasses, whipped asses
I advise you to tell us where the cash is
Itchy fingers cause nothing but gun fire
We disallow all these cats in the camp
We the champs, not really to boast and brag
Bustin' heads, body bags and toe tags
Black mags to blow your whole chest in half
If you don't know the equation then you can't do the math
I know you cram to understand the plan, but you too
Caught up in the rapture, front and we will capture
See men and strap ya, cock back and blast ya
Blow up your fuckin' house while we still lookin' at ya
Militia man...man part three

Just to feed the babies I'll infect you like rabies
With a lust for the gravy, you know the god must be crazy
I'm sick with it, I'm built with stilts for you midgets
While you fidget, you could get kill't for your digits
I'll creep on the low, keep it a secret yo
I swore an oath to dump on you, out the Jeep window
I don't care if you a geek or a thug, you sleepin' on us
And you could catch it, some royal heat from the snub
Since the streets is watchin' niggas might see us often
We told you rap cats we would keep it poppin'
See all I got is a lot of bad news for y'all
You're gonna need more than a lot of tattoos on y'all
You got an army, you still ain't got no wins against us
You're gonna need more than doo rags and Timb's against us
And fuck your goons cause we always get what we're after
We bought you this book of torture, this one is Capture

There's one ripped out the frame, felony act
Everybody get the fuck up, welcome me back
I'm the unseen hand that controls 200 niggas
Pouring while on the street out of unseen vans
I'm the law of the land, the rawness of man
That'll show up on stage, puffin' on contraband
Capture, duct tape wrapped ya, slapped ya
Served up my Venus and Serenas, cocked back
Clapped ya - to Internet emcees I'm virus
I'm a warrior, niggas screamin' "Bumpy shot Cyrus"
I'm checked in to every hotel that you lay in
Niggas come to my suite to pick up heat
Y'all know who wrote the bible in rap, for keepin it real
Y'all know who buck fifty your face, I'm keepin it Seal
It's capture, get out the truck, I'm keepin' your wheels
Clapped ya, cause you've got a gun you never conceal
I leave my hardcore demeanor in every rap arena
And underground club that I play in
I spit raw verses that y'all ain't sayin'
Cause your soul was bought for what they payin'
You wanna have Bumpy's heart you got to have Bumpy's chest
I'll bust right 'till I find just Bumpy left
I'll bust mics 'till I have just enough breath
To take your heart, it's thug grand death
CAPTURE![Intro]
Crush the amateurs who scream they keep it real (x4)

Verse One:
The bragadocious MC has returned
To backdraft, torch niggas and burn
My sound moves like kilos underground
Cock me back, like a sledgehammer I'mma pound
Niggas into the ground like stakeness
This shit is fakeness, so I'mma break this
Monotony, and show 'em how it's supposed to be done
And keep lame niggas on the run
It's B-I-G S-H-U-G, try to remove me
Find yourself with loose teeth
And you can't stop the unstoppable
Niggas is droppable
When I'm coming through with my lyrical
I'm the ruffneck shwingin'
Drama that I'm bringin'
On your left jaw I'll be tingin'
Because left hooks turns mouths to mush
And when you're in my grip your whole game will get crushed

[Hook]
Crush the amateurs who scream they keep it real
To every hardcore that you hit the hard floor

Verse Two:
I'll slam an MC like cowboys do cattle
And rattle any snake mutha fucka who wish to battle
There's no way you can win
I'm wipin' off silly grins
When I come to kick your face in
And I'mma break you down to your atom
And if you test that, then I'mma grab one and bat 'em
Down to the ground with this sound
Stash your body parts and they're nowhere to be found
I'mma keep my mental on danger
Anger proves to you that I'm no stranger
And I'mma keep it real as I can
Comin' from murderpan who I am
I'm greater than, that means you're less than
Are you a man, I don't think so with gun in your hand
And I live behind a wall
And when I was released Big Shug is still standing tall

[Hook]

Verse Three:
Comin' through with the cynderblock flows
Keepin' your dick hard, while pussy's wanna tiptoe
Through the valleys of death, troubles of hell
No matter how they gas me, head will never swell
I'm sending you up the river in a holey boat
And rippin' your sleeves off your lambskin coat
You wanna be tough well come test Shug
And you'll find out that my shit is all good
I represent to the fullest that's all I know
And I've got to come through swingin' elbows
And I'll hold the post, hold down the middle
And niggas get knocked the fuck out when they wanna fiddle
You gotta be serious, nothing is too mysterious
Niggas is comin' with the truth
And my punchline is punchin' niggas offline
When I come through we represent everytime

[Hook][DJ Premier]
Yeah, yo
Ladies and gentlemen I present to you straight out the Gangstarr Foundation:
BIG SHUG! Go ahead speak on...

[Big Shug]
Catch me sipping on that moonshine tonic
Freshly dipped in these hip hop garments
You try to bomb it, I take it and disarm it
Hit you in the gut now you vomit, Sean John all on it
But I rock them wheels
Real niggas pop up and stay right there
Fake niggas stand down and stay right there
This is street music so it stays right here
Big shug, I spit fire for the hood
For realness feel this, higher for the hood
Blazing blocks, ripping internet some web pages
I rip stages, with ?v-block? and singapore
You want the raw? It's pure and uncut
Me and my cats we're pure and uncut
You niggas is butt, so I say screw ya
I bring them four fives and two twos to do ya

[Chorus]
I bring the fire to your grill, I barbecue ya
I got the flames on blaze, just to do ya
I'MA DO YA!

(*"Ease up, don't squeeze up"*)
(*"Then let it be known, I don't play" Latee - No tricks*)

I bring the fire to your grill, I barbecue ya
I got the flames on blaze, I'ma do ya
I'MA DO YA!

(*"Ease up, don't squeeze up"*)
(*"Then let it be known, I don't play" Latee - No tricks*)

[Big Shug]
You wouldn't know the truth if it bit you in the throat
If it was written all over linen in your coat
If it jumped up and slapped you to the floor
If it banged in your head like ?two-one-four?
You breath the fakeness, click click take this
You fake rich, so you dont own shit
And soon all your kids will just know
That dad's homo and you scream: Oh no!
I see through you, I ?peep? your concept
You need to understand like Funkmaster Flex
I drop bombs on nothing but real shit
My hip hop is nothing but real shit
Like hot bricks, it sticks to your ribs
Front on me and I'll do ya, kid!
I straight do ya!

(*"Ease up, don't squeeze up"*)
(*"Then let it be known, I don't play" Latee - No tricks*)

[Chorus]

[Big Shug]
It's a thin line between snitch and jake
Between real and fake, between piehead and cake
You snitch the jake and get killed
Real niggas pop, fake niggas get drilled
I make cake for moving, them pies and pills
Fuck the gangsta overkill, I spit for real
Deal is in place, rhymes is in place
Jaw is out of place when you spit with this taste
Or even approach with that disrespect
I put two to your neck and beat your ass for wreck
I straight do ya!

(*"Ease up, don't squeeze up"*)

[Chorus]

[Big Shug]
Word to Joe Frazier, got ta do what pays ya
Give a nigga pain, like dysplasia
But close your hips in, nigga you can't win
I walk around, with a scowl and a grin
Parties try to rock me, chicks try to clock me
Niggas try to block me, but they can't stop me
I'm a bad man, understand where I come from
Treatin niggas dumb, as I drink my rum
I'm a mad man, I get respect with the Tec
Put punks in check, Shug's on the set
I'm the one with the game, the twelve round
CRACK to the concrete, from the underground
I'm a bad nigga, how do you figure to take me
You cannot break me, so don't mistake me
For your brother, I'm not a punk motherfucker see
I did my time, and now I'm FREE
I'm a dope one, ready to rip and wreck shop
I will not stop, I won't be dropped by the cops
I'm bad, understand me with the game I kick
I got crazy bitches like a Trojan on my dick

[Guru]
Yo Hobb we got more rep than Lucky Luciano
Suckers we wet to the sound of the dope piano
This is something you can't handle, here's one example
I got your head as a trophy up on the mantle
Each and every sect we wreck, the crowd's electrified
Mystified, you get dissed, when you try, you die
Fish niggas, they get fried upon my skillet
I kill it, fuck it, my shit is on hit
And hittin you blaow (BLAOW) so what you wanna do now?
You stepped up, I whacked ya, you crept up, I smacked ya
Got infinite length, with the strength of a real master
If you don't bow down now you'll get plowed down now
You know, like POW

Fuck Around, Lay Around, do or die (3X)
So Fuck Around, Lay Around, do or die

Word to Mike Tyson, hit you quick like lightnin
Swing my left jab first, and then come in with the right
Cold deck ya, nah I could never respect a
Punk like you, you get dropped like one two
And you're out son, just like a one round bout son
The outcome, is that you'll get that ass hung
Easily, swiftly, you'ew stupid you can't get with me

Fuck Around, Lay Around, do or die (2X)
I said Fuck Around, Lay Around, do or die

[Big Shug]
Fumin! HEAHHH, I'm boomin down on niggas
I figure, how could they take out a big nigga
They don't know, so I don't never give em a clue
That's you and you and you, and oh yeah you
You can't get with this or take me down
I'm always laughin HA HA cause you punks are clowns
Since I'm passin emcees, with my skill
I'm up on the hill, and I force them dudes to chill
Rippin up shit as I do, because I'm violent
That's why when I walk in the room, punks are silent
My name is Shug, as if you didn't know
I'm pimpin hard, and punks are just a ho

Fuck Around, Lay Around, do or die (2X)
I said you Fuck Around, Lay Around, do or die
Fuck Around, Lay Around, do or die
I said you Fuck Around, Lay Around, do or die

* DJ Premier cuts and scratchs this line to the end *[Intro: Big Shug]
One two one two.. Yeah! Yeah! Just test, runnin see what's good
Yeah man hardbody man
Niggas be thinkin man that you hardbody cause you be
Gettin steroids and liftin' weights off your chest and such
Hardbody is emotions man where we come from man
That's how we left it, uh huh!!

[Verse One: Big Shug]
I was beat at a young age
So everyday I walk around in a black rage
Burned in my arm are street stripes
I only bleed rhymes that reflect that street life
The grim reaper I give and take life
For me to lie on the microphone it wouldn't be right
I get it poppin when the weapons are louder
My hands the permanent smell of smoke and gun powder
From New England but fuck that clam chowder
You could make it rain, but I'm a make it shower
Serve nothin' but fishscale and rock powder
Hardbody by the minute hardbody by the hour
Battle rhymes or spoken word
The outcome nigga, you two times herb
Belly of the beast, or the placenta
I'm the reason why mad niggas, walk around with dentures
Hardbody with a blue steel feel
Black gat called Dave spray Copper around the field
Hardbody turn you to cold body
Then I go to the bar and sip coke with lime Bacardi
While my niggas in the back, cuttin' your body

[Interlude: DJ Premier Scratching] (Fat Joe)
H-H-Hard-Hard-Hard-Hard-"LL Cool J"
Hardbody-body-"Big Shug" (Coca! Chrills Mania B.X. T.S.)
(Follow the dons and models it's on!)
H-Hard-H-Hard-H-H-H-Hard-Hard-"LL Cool J"
Hardbody-body-"Big Shug" (PREME! SHUG!)

[Verse Two: Fat Joe]
Hardbody, Godbody the realest ever
Just ask Preme if I bring the Terror
Squeeze the mental until it's no forever
Used to like the Glocks but the chrome is better
Ha Ha! I'm just an old school cat
With an old school gat, that'll fold you back
Them niggas get it poppin should've told you that
Don't make me push your spine where your vocals at
Ha! (H-H-Hard-"LL Cool J" Hardbody-"Big Shug) I mean you fuckin with Coca
Arms in the sky when the don got the toaster
I blacks out like a G is supposed to
Stretch niggas out like Rosa Acosta (H-H-Hardbody-"Big Shug")
You ain't even close homey
Nigga bettin' millions on the horses and ponies
Everybody real but the odds is they phony
'Bout to rape the game like Mike did to Sony

[Interlude: DJ Premier Scratchin]
H-H-Hard-body-H-H-Hardbody-"Big Shug"

[Verse Three: Lil' Fame]
My local game's official, bring that shit
I got a dead arm like the Ying Yang Twin
But today's motto pour the liquor from the bottle
It's an everyday thang here today gone tomorrow
When Fame walks in you feel the presence of a don
When I shoot the gift it's the presence from the chron
Yes I stress that
The last place you stand is the place you'll be left at
Expect that!!!

[Verse Four: Billy Danze]
You new wave niggas!!! Hard a spittin image of a pawn
I'm a knight, hardbody like them niggas in the yard
You light! You niggas ain't about to cause harm
To a Bin Laden type rapper nigga with his clapper with him
Highly respected good nigga in the town
When you G'D UP!!! (BUCK BUCK BUCK BUCK BUCK BUCK!!!) Shut 'em down!!!
(EASE UP!!!) We don't give a fuck shut 'em down!!!
Big Shug's with me Danze niggas can't forget me hardbody!!!

[Verse 1: XL]
We're from the B to the O-S-T-O-N
Where cats double push friends for dollars and gems
Platinum artistes they don't wanna come here (nah)
Not cause of lack of money or bitches, but out of fear
Rappers up here be gettin' overlooked for years
Started hatin' on eachother sabotagin' careers
Ten o' the best MC's we got to offer
To shut down you cock blockin' shit talkers

[Verse 2: Ed O.G.]
Mad niggas think they flossin' in rap
But no one knew Boston could rap
Till Edo put this shit on the map
Now the change is drastic, Hip-Hop got Jurassic
And none of you Boston bastards made a classic
Got the right voice, make the right noise
Can't stand none of you niggas and none of you white boys
My men's is down to take the city, hands down
From the ropes to Pakis all the way to Landsdown

[Verse 3: Big Juan]
How you gon' lie about the place that you're from?
The house you grow up in, the block that you hung
Politics ain't my fortay
You gettin' fucked without the foreplay
Heaven trouble comin' through the doorway
G ain't playin' you dubs in the clubs
And heads ain't showin' you no love in the Hub
Spend time on the road, hotel's all alone
Not for Hillstreet times ain't no place like home

[Hook: Guru](4x)
I'mma get home, I'mma get there
Make it back even if I'm caught outthere

[Verse 4: JaySon]
When I think of the Bean I think of the artist who
Got fucked over by Maurice Starr and Larry Wu
I think I-L-D, fifteen years of R & B transmitted outside Dudley
Plus the Bumrush specially celebrities
Aks Kane, Moe Dee, Mo Vaughn and Eric B
Murdapan, Deathchester and Glocksbury
The weed's extra sticky, coke's extra heavy

"Boston"
[Verse 5:Big Shug]
It's the chin checkin', Chuck chokin' predator
Boston rap (Big Shug) Murdapan settler (huh)
I'm bettin' the stakes be high, when you die
Diss the crew, and lose the sight in you eyes
We multiply to bring the real on the track
Cross the line and there ain't no goin' back (fuckin' fag)
In fact, these niggas will rip ya ass apart
Bury that head in Franklin and your body in Hyde Park

We make history daily
Represent Boston like Arabs and Israelis
Police tail me, backstabbers try to nail me
DJ's play me at the clubs past eleven
On 88.9, 94.5 and Hot97
Beantown's a cold city Dorchester gritty
Murdered over a fifty, hometown ain't it shifted
I travel the map but I always come back
To burn it down behind 24 tracks

[Verse 7: Krumb Snatcha]
Shoot outs fit niggas get twist in the Bean
Below the exploded magazine leave my head on the scene
Long time to Glocksbury twist your nine on the spot
Either you out to get this paper, or you work for the cops
My don stylo finally ya niggas know how it go
Most hated at the back with the gats at the show
Quick to die with the stripes on squeezing like a python
Half the industry ya already dead before the mic's on

[Verse 8: Akrobatik]
My rapstyle's changed like Rodman's head
It's Akrobatik representin' Codman Square (Hell yeah)
Where you can hop on the Red Line
And catch me at the Middle East
Wippin' hoes close to headline
The winter's east Stone Cold like Steve Austin
But I promise my heart will never leave Boston
And that's the bottom line cause Akro say so
Intimidatin' with my pitch changed up like Pedro

Znów wychodzę z domu i wkładam słuchawki na uszy
By po kryjomu składać te słowa które krzyczą mi w duszy
Jestem jak ich niewolnik mówię by zrzucić więzy
Lecz nie muszę się prosić same cisną się na język
Bloki znają moje myśli tak dobrze
Ze gdybym miał z nimi beef to jakbym liczył na problem
Wiec przyłóż ucho do ulic i ucz się od nich
To nie slogan bo wdeptałem swoją dusze w chodnik
Spójrz te same buty drugi sezon
Gdy co drugi jak kupi nike to gubi rezon
One wiedzą więcej niż ja o mnie
Bo śledzą moje życie biegnąc po trotuarze wspomnień
Wiesz to nie aleja gwiazd synek
Jesteś tu anonimem jak każdy z nas synek
Bloki wchłoną twoją osobowość na zawsze
Nie protestuj i chodź usiądź obok na ławce

[CUTY]

[Włodi]
Bloki wchłonęły moją ślinę, mocz i krew
Szybko powiedzą co mam w sobie jak narkotest
Mówią do mnie głosem przyjaciół i wrogów
Widziały mój postęp pierwszy krok w stronę grobu
Mówią: od sześciu lat masz trójkę z przodu
Drugą córkę - to dobry powód by stad uciec
Zamienić beton na podmiejski eden
I opowiadać dzieciom ze o blokach nic nie wiem
Spoko, może nadmucham tą mydlaną bańkę
Kiedyś na zawsze z bliskimi się w niej zamknę
Dziś jak Pysk salutuje osiedlom
Sam sobie gratuluję że wciąż widzę tu piękno
Palę spliffa na schodach, czy to głuchy telefon?
Może są tu podsłuchy albo mówi sam beton
No bo skąd tu te mordy ciągle chętne do działki
Chciałbym powiedzieć blokom czasem kurwa się zamknij

[CUTY]

[Big Shug]
We all rap, but we not the same man
You from the suburbs and I’m from Manhattan man
Where we handle our business with weapons or the hand
For quarter kis to move or a package with 7 grams
Sometimes it’s crimes that I can’t understand
Like shooting for no reasons at babies and women man
For my hood it’s not the finest hour
My true hustle prevail to show that street power
They came round us to get rich
Then turn and snitch on niggas you made them plans with
Dig deep my nigga, think deep my nigga
If you’re not built for this then put down the trigger
Code of the streets, ain’t nothing sweet
Keep that ass moving or get that ass beat
Triple OG Big Shug, that’s what it is

[CUTY]

[Pyskaty]
Mógłbym uciec stąd i zmienić krajobraz na inny
Lecz wciąż czuję jakby ktoś mi nie przeciął pępowiny
To inny czas lecz oddaje hołd miejscu, które
Zmieniło nas w mężczyzn i osiedlowych mędrców
Dziś postrzegamy świat w inny sposób
Nieubłaganie zbliża się czas siwych włosów
Lecz od dziecka wiem dobrze że nie lektury szkolne
A bloki są tu źródłem etosu
Były gdy mieliśmy rower i deskę i wciąż są
Chodź dziś wolimy browar i kreskę
I być może to nie męskie to że tęsknię
Ale wciąż kocham wracać w to miejsce
Gdzie sandały nie mogą się obejść bez skarpet
A balet burdel kac i kościół to weekendowy kwartet
Tu gdzie rzucam swoje tagi na kamień
By bloki znały moje imię na pamięć

[CUTY]
[Teksty i wyjaśnienia na Rap Genius Polska][Intro] [Big Shug talking]

"Reppin' Boston" - Big Shug

[Verse One] [Big Shug]
It's not the NBA, we don't jump in the air and bump
It's around the way, where cats jump outta the car and dump
Boston
Where some cats, guns are props
Some pop, some end up in the morgue shop
From Blue Hill Ave, to Talbot Ave, to Derby Park
I pushed the whips, hustle my money, and got my start
Norfolk Park is where I rocked and bared my soul
Boston, outta control, death toll
We got cops on foot, and bike patrol
It's been the same way since I was eight years old
Racism
We beat that back
I seen the whole world, but I still keep comin' back
I love my town, not for Paul Revere
But for Big Shug's legend and Murderpan Square
Touch the stage, as a GangStarr survivor
I rep for Boston, and it gets no liver
Than...

[Hook] [Big Shug]
Boston, aye
My Boston, ho
My town
My Boston, hey
My Boston, ho
"Reppin' Boston"
My town
My Boston, hey
My Boston, ho
My Boston, hey
"Reppin' Boston"

[Verse Two] [Singapore Kane]
Yo, think of Boston I think of racists, Charles Stuart cases
Crooked jakes shine flashlights in our faces
Home of the Red Sox, Celtics, and the Patriots
And crash dummy kids with guns ready to spray shit
Every city's the same shit, don't matter the size
Anywhere the population is poor, then you got crimes
Some dudes be doin' crimes, some dudes be doin' rhymes
Salute, my dawgs in the System doin' their time
What you think? Cause we got Harvard
Boston niggas don't be robbin', mobbin' when we starvin'?
Smoke blunts like Redeye back in the Garden
We'll see who's hard, when you're confronted by my squadron
Talk on and on 'bout your million gats, but if you're pussy
We'll skin you like Brazilian Wax
A lotta cats die flossin'
Bitches shed tears for years cause you got Paul Pierced in my Boston

[Hook] [Big Shug]
Boston, aye
My Boston, ho
My town
My Boston, hey
My Boston, ho
"Reppin' Boston"
My town
My Boston, hey
My Boston, ho
My Boston, hey
"Reppin' Boston"

[Verse Three] [Termanology]
One two
Jeah, it's the L-A-W-T-O-W-N
Law-town, niggas done it again
Let me tell you 'bout my city
It's wild gritty
I got a hundred and fifty spics that ride with me
Wanna know 'bout crooked cops livin' in Boston?
Hit the block, bust a homie, cop get the pardon
You can learn about my Bean in Hi-D
These sirens in my dreams
It's a wild scene
Mamas in the street pick up their son, like "Why me? "
No I.D., the boy got stuck like I.V.s
Throw my threes, these wild streets, can't retire me
On my beats, they all bang, like I signed with Preem
Legendary like, Paul Pierce in the wheelchair
Lotta cats hatin' on me, but I'm still here
From Hell-town, back to Mattapan Square
Beware!
What a wonderful place to live

[Hook] [Big Shug]
Boston, aye
My Boston, ho
My town
My Boston, hey
My Boston, ho
"Reppin' Boston"
My town
My Boston, hey
My Boston, ho
My Boston, hey
"Reppin' Boston"[Verse 1: Ed O.G]
I sat back and took a look, but son got stole like a crook
Yo he shook, we into every cranny and nook, so look
You'll get open like a book in the library
Where niggas lie and die heavy in the 'bury
So sons I roll with, I throw with
If shit unfolded, unravel, who rolled it?
Hold it, to the tips til its burnin'
Couldn't feel the gap in my bamboo, dogs wasn't churnin'
But the world keeps turnin'
From Dorchester, to Matapan, to Mount Vernon
Yo the city life be intense
You can get jumped like a fence ghetto thirst being quenched
Where niggas mob like the lynch, rob like the grinch who stole christmas
Don't get yourself dismissed
Or get crumbled like tissue
I see through your crew like crystal
Lets make it official

[Verse 2: Scientifik]
It's the return of the dragon who keep his pants saggin'
Write more shit than the graffiti artists taggin' in the trainyard
My mental weapons leave your brain scarred
The edo flow will keep it real you never change god
The mic controller powerful like ayatollah
Shine like solar, who could get caught like I was polar
Hard just like a molar tooth, a hundred proof
Like some yukon jack, cause the true don's back
I just gotta get paid, make sure that J get made
You get sprayed like windex, when I flex the index
Finger, you'll be dead like a ringer
Its only Scientifik got his song like singer
Control your whole shit, yous a fraction like 3/10
Bring your brigade and get played like defense
You been a G since you heard about spice one
A lot of rappers got guns I have to slice one
When I sneak up in the party with my razor
Plus I got a crew that could burn with the blazers
And leave a trail of blood all the way to portland
Organized on the side never go to court and
You know I have an empire when I strike back
Im havin sneaky niggas sayin sci's like that

[Verse 3: Big Shug]
On the microphone I'm surprising
I'm burning down MC's houses like that chick did Andre Rison
Still keeping them off balance, they can't challenge
Their whole shit is absent or malice
It's Big Shug I'm the best in the game
I'm running up lanes, I got the power of a freight train
I hit ya in the chin, chin to head, head to ground
Boom, when I knock your ass down
'95 the brand new sound, from a new town
With mad brothas to get down
We should have had ours by now
So if you stand in the way catch the cock back blaow!
I keep the mad lyrical
And if you fuck up,then I'll be signing at your funeral
It's not the way to go out
But when we come about
We tearing niggas the fuck up and kicking 'em out
And maintain and keep it real
Knowing the rhythm of steel and make sure you all feel
It's a B-O-S-T-O-N thing
And we come with mad drama to bring
When we shoot, we won't mis-shoot, hate to have to diss you
But this year, its official
Yea

[Outro]
Now hold up, let's make this official (4x)[Intro]
Yeah man, all I'm sayin is
Just play the music, play all of the music man
We gotta keep some balance in the game
You know? Let it play man, for real

Uuhuuh, Big Shug, Primo
You know the deal
Just play these records man, all of em
DJs, all around the world

[Verse 1]
This year, I'm not fuckin with coward cats
Who hide behind they raps and flashy Cadillacs
Scared of the battle raps and semiauto gats
But wanna push wack rhymes ____ official cats
Who wanna feel the purple haze and sparks with cattle graze
Swimmin pool with dime chicks, spendin happy days
With all my niggas, blaze, honey dips gets glazed
And I'm paid a hundred grand when I hit the stage
This is not a phase, its a real niggas wage
And I'mma make sure I get it before I'm back in the cage
I promise to shoot and blaze, till my dyin days
Till DJ stan and my musics played
Any beef with me will end in castastrophe
I'm winnin while you losin, thats how it just has to be
From the vinyl, to the cd j
Give the fans a chance to hear the fly shit I say
Play the record or get smacked clean
With anotha bangin joint from Big Shug and DJ Prim

[Hook 1]

(Play it) play it (play it) play it (play it) play it (play it) play it
(play it) play it (play it) play it
Let the music play, hey
(You know we get down)
Let the music play, hey
(On the microphone)
Let the music play, hey
(Rhymes flowin like water)
Let the music play, (hip hop) everyday
Let the music play, hey
(You know we get down)

(...record is massive evidence, of the flexibility and toughness of the
Principles you profess)

[Verse 2]
I do it all to show my skills, till pushin' daffodils
I be on the roof tops, accurate for the kill
From old school to new school dudes, I set the tone
I'm a vocal, crush and do other things to your bones
When I face my enemies, I creep like a centipide
Smoke that angel weed while I'm spittin that 16
The games been a hunch, referee true and lunch
I spit the hottest fire, and always pack a punch
Play the record or get your station smothered
Or get your head popped off like Saddam Hussein brother

[Hook 2]
Play it (play it) play it (play it) play it (play it) play it (play it) play
It (play it, play it, play it)
Let the music play, hey
(You know we get down)
Let the music play, hey
(On the microphone)
Let the music play, hey
(Rhymes flowin like water)
Let the music play, (hip hop) everyday
Let the music play

[Outro]
All I'm sayin DJs, around the world, let the music play man
All the music ain't got to sound the same
This is Big Shug, DJ Primo, what could be better?
Let that music play man, for real
Street champ, I'm goneArtist: Group Home f/ Big Shug, Guru
Album: Livin' Proof
Song: Serious Rap Shit

[Guru]
From jump street I thump beats, that's bangin in the streets
See now my cypher's complete
I got each of my brothers on my side, right and left
Who's next to flex, I get more thrills than sex
Microphone is like a loaded mac
Who's that there that's tryin to hold us back?
I don't think so, we attack the premises
I'm like your nemesis, devils better remember this
Yo, the G-U-R-U, of the Gang, can always hang
I'll string you out, with the dope that I sling
And you can't touch it, when I'm goin off
And crazy shouts, to my niggas up North
Although you're locked down, you're still on my mind
So rewind selector, rewind rewind
I'm kickin shit off my dome
I puff the chalice with dread feel the steel the real the chrome

Me and my fam take this rap shit serious
New York to L.A., and you niggas best to fear this
(repeat 2X)

[Malachi Tha Nutcracker]
Aiyyo spark up the mic, little shorty on some wild shit
I'll pull your file, walk down the streets without a smile
Kid shit is gettin hectic, I'm packin a mac-10
Niggas wanna check it, I'm thirsty for action
Ninety-five shit is real gotta pack my steel
Just in case a nigga try to kill me, chill
I ain't goin out like that
I bust enough caps in backs, and other niggas they be fakin jacks
Best what, to back up, before you get smacked up
You act up, reload the clip, now back up
Straight up, don't let me break fool because you lose...

Me and my fam, take this rap shit serious
New York to L.A., and you niggas best to fear this
(repeat 4X)

[Big Shug]
I sit back, and watch MC's take freefalls
Bounce em off walls, like Superball
Stand tall, and terrorize MC's
All the ones who wanna be like me
You can't get with the exquisite shit I kiddick
You get caught up, like Ted Kennedy, in Chappaquidick
You can't roll with my flavor or style
I outlast MC's by miles, and I got
The hot, style that pops
I'm givin hardrocks body shots when I rock
You can't even test me, no matter how hard you try
Fuck Around Lay Around punk, do or die
I'm back again, the roughneck nigga from Boston
When I swing, I got mad drama that I bring
The crews, all back me up
And we come to rip cause our shit's too rough, yeah!

Me and my fam, take this rap shit serious
New York to L.A., and you niggas best to fear this
(repeat 4X)

[Big Shug] Uhh
[Lil' Dap] Yeah, baby pah like this[Big Shug]
Yeah, I'm sick of this bullshit
Fake-ass niggas and shit, y'knahmean?
One, yeah
Get it right man f'real, stop whinin and shit
Shut your punk ass up f'real
I'm sick of your punk ass

I'm sick of niggas, who claim to be the best
Say they sleep with the vest but won't come fi test
I'm sick of niggas, who wanna front on Cribs
But won't invite Shug over for the beef ribs
I'm sick of niggas, who say they street like me
I see by your profile you deeply sweet
I'm sick of niggas, who like to talk to cops
And scared to death to box, and suck on cocks
I'm sick of niggas, who rhyme in the same clique
You sound like your man and he's, dog shit
I'm sick of niggas, who fell the fuck off
It's over now nigga, get the fuck off
I'm sick of niggas, who claim to be the boss
But spend their money, on pedicures and lip gloss
I'm sick of niggas, who ask me for money
I slap the dog shit out you sonny, I'm sick

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Wit'cha fake-ass gangsta shit, I'm sick of niggas
In they trick clothes tryin to pimp, I'm sick of niggas
In the hood now chillin with rats, I'm sick of niggas
I'm sick sick, sick sick sick, sick of niggas

[Freddie Foxxx a.k.a. Bumpy Knuckles]
Listen, it's Bumpy Knuckles niggas bow, salute the royal higness
I'm the finest and divine of all rhymers, since the 90's
Hardcore niggas I'm back, sick at you niggas
Still got that ol', fo', fifth at you niggas
I'm sick of you niggas who get, but don't help get
Other niggas bread blockin they shit
I'm sick of niggas and this earring shit, both ears hangin
Like granny in the large house sangin
Sick of niggas who fake gangbangin, set-claimin and crack slangin
But got they NexTel police phone rangin
I'm sick of white boys who got soul
Still on this mic, cause I'm still not cold, y'all not fuckin with me
I'm sick of niggas with they fancy cars
You spittin bullshit, step up your bars
Sick of rap suckers, I got SARS - get it? SARS
Sick of havin to always explain my bars

[Outro - repeat 2X]
I'm sick of niggas, who want a deal
I'm sick of niggas, who I cannot feel
I'm sick of niggas, who snitch and squeal
I'm sick, I'm sick, I'm sick[Intro: Big Shug]
AY! Heh Ha! One two one two. Big Shug baby!
Spit si-i-x! AH HA! Lil' different right now AH HA!

[Verse One] [Big Shug]
I break bread with six, different cats
Roll like a funeral in six, Cadillacs
With six, mini skirts, popped up in the back
Five, four, or six hours to six, different tracks
Come back in six hours with six, different stacks
Opposition get knocked out, with six different taps
Try to rob my chicks, get hit, with six claps
It's still me and Preme two albums and six tracks
Six booms six baps that's six thorough tracks
From two veteran niggas real Gang Starr cats
It's hip hop baby, I always been wit' it
Do twelve interviews and slap, six critics
I want, six grand for my first stand
And I want, six grand for my last stand
It's the new Lee Majors, six million dollar man
Big Shug niggas! And I rep Murderpan
Spit six, six, six

[Verse Two] [Big Shug]:
I'm quick to smack, six niggas
Pay six more niggas to smack, six more niggas I break
Six chicks with six, different lines
Have 'em do the same crime like six, different times
At six o'clock, hit 'em all, six different times
When I go to war, I'm bringin six different nines
And shootin from each one, like six different times
So that's, six deaths, six suits to get
Six crazy cats left wet AH HA!
So we, leave town six limos six jets
Six stripes, like Vietnam vets
Live life lavish, six kids and six pets
Six maids and six chefs, great steaks and french strips
Sunkin' living rooms with six steps
Phone text, I receive like six, death threats
Keep it away from the crib or you'll see bodies left
I don't spit six, for the devilish rhymes
I'm Godly I spit six, seven different times
AH HA! AH HA! AH HA!

Yeah, here we go, here we go
Big Shug, comin at you baby with my man Singapore
Got the streets movin on 'em baby, that's whassup
Make moves on them niggas

Once again, it's the last of the dying breed
Burstin and pushin trees, blastin my enemies
Never conform to nothin, always perform for somethin
Hustle for big chips, shufflin cards and shit
Spittin it for the bricks, spittin it for this clique
Spittin it for the thugs surrounded by dime chicks
Yes I stay intense, my style's, different
I purify the water like 50 Cent
Spit it heavy heavy, Porsche Caddy or Chevy
Who gave a fuck about your ride when they broke the levy
Don't blame it on the Pres, blame it on the black mayor
The Pres got the power, the mayor's just a sayer
I'm still touchin pullin squeezin and clappin
Co-captain when I spit on beats by Preem
I live the life, that you MC's dream
But I'm still chasin after the cream
Yes I'm still at it, hungry like the very first day
When I picked the microphone up and made the crowd sway
I still scream JUST MOVE ON 'EM
Put the weapons in the air and put TWO ON 'EM~!

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Streets move on 'em, he fake moves put two on him
Aim for the head, put pressure on him
Don't believe what he say, just move on him
Streets move on 'em, streets move on 'em

{*scratch: "go against the grain cause I'm a real man"*}
{*"a sad game, we all tryin to win it"*} {*"gangsters respect"*}

[Singapore Kane]
Poetic street lyricist, hot flows bring heat to my sentences
Fuck a weak gimmick cause I'm deep, did I mention that
MC's try to spit but I hoch lungies
I was dope when Bobby Brown was rockin that Gumby
Cops fear me cause they don't scare me
My "Moment of Truth" came when I applied the "Robbin Hood Theory"
Rob from the rich and give to the poor
I'm tight on the stage with the mic, like Eddie Murphy in _Raw_
On the block where I drunk 'gnac and threw up, where Malcolm X grew up
Where new bucks try to make a few bucks
The crack route might get that ass whacked out
I beat backs out, drink Guinness Black Stout
I know rastas who still drive Cressidas
And pack machetes to fuck up your skin like eczema
I be smooth, when I hear the beat groove
Richter couldn't measure, how I make the streets move, streets move

[Hook]

[Big Shug]
You foolin the people, push records to sell
Rappin that lie music, dancin to minstrel
Sinful to sing your hooks, layin out for the crooks
We know you ain't sayin nothin your whole persona's shook
I'm likin that ice too, I'm likin them cars too
Born with no silver spoon, grindin I have to do
True with my moves, never settle for nothin
Record deals are false, cats with no pulse
Sayin I can be thug, when they know they man's soft
The industry is soft, take a look at your boss
Today, he's the one, livin like Bill Gates
Tell you everyday to hurry up so you can wait
Your mentality's street so every day you creep
He could be yo' next victim any day of the week
Grab him by the shirt, look him dead in the eye
Yell out Biggie Smalls, make him "Ready to Die"Let's go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Big Big Shug, Big Big Shug

(And this is the way, the way)
The way it is
(And this is the way, the way)
The way it is

[Big Shug]
I'm not the, Lord of the Rings, I'm the lord of poppin them things
Settin you up, and takin your bling
Hoes love the way I spit it though
Cause of the Speakerboxxx they give me Love Below
I'm from Murderpan where they raise no snitches
But some cats still do, I navigate
Nicely around them cats, you snitch on me
They find your ass out back
Bein' chewed on by the pigeons and the rats
Hollow your body, and that's a fact black
Fo' sure
You not an MC, you'se a rapper
Fashion yourself, after Hollywood actors
I ain't hatin' on your progression though
Cause for two years now your skills have been in recession yo
No aggression, no passion, no heart
That's when shit, starts to fall apart
More money, more security
Out of touch nigga you can't even feel me
Deadbeat nigga owe money to your kids
That's just the way it is, the way it is

[Hook]
(And this is the way, the way)
The way it is
(Now I'm back with the flyest material)
(And this is the way, the way)
The way it is
(I got plans for this rap game)
(And this is the way, the way)
The way it is
(The look in my eye punk, has got you scared of me)
(And this is the way, the way)
The way it is
The way it is

[Big Shug]
Lil' mane, playin' the blame game
Can't take the weight, blame it on your mayne
Sound like a bitch, a-gain in the game
When shit's goin' smooth you go against the grain
Fake cuckoo, like you goin' insane
But won't hold a gun to your motherfuckin' brain
You used to be so right, you used to be so tight
Now I wanna knock out your fuckin' lights
Fright night nigga, scared of your own shadow
You, you, yes you, you wanna battle
I'll eat your ass up and stuff you in a barrel
Crush up your bones and feed the pits the marrow
Serious biz, I got out for the scriz
That's just the way it is, the way it is

(And this is the way, the way, the way)

[Hook]"Here's a bulletin from state police, Princeton Junction."

"The militia...
Certain individuals of unidentified nature
Is now under complete control"

"Hip-hop is not, what it is today.."

"It's the real *echoes*... it's the (militia)"

[Verse 1: Big Shug]
If heads only knew how I felt about the rap game
They'd relocate, and change their fuckin name
I eradicate movefakers, roll with coat shakers
Give dap to mad money makers
Shared cells with lifetakers, have sex with rumpshakers
I make moves so I'mma earthquaker
I've been known to instill fear
Although the world may be round, we still trapped in the square
City light, got me buggin and trife
Some die by the gun, some die by the knife
It's alright, like a game of spades I'm trump tight
Premier hit me with music to ensure that it thump right
And my flight, will be taken solely at night
Cause that's when the freaks come out, no doubt
And in the dark hours is when I will shower
With the knowledge of my trade to get paid
Still I make moves like a snake in the grass, roundabout
I be dickin it down while you be assed out
Puff mad L's but never passed out
And if I'm caught up in a jam I blast my way out
There'll be no lettin up, just straight shuttin up
Or we'll start the wettin up
Lyrical infrared sceptor never miss you
Big Shug, Guru, Freddie Foxxx, The Militia, militia

[Hook: Freddie Foxxx]
Everybody's spittin it, the rhyme is hot
Cause it's Big Shug, Guru, and Freddie the Foxxx
When Premier bring the beats, no it just don't stop
It's The Militia *echoes*

Chorus

[Verse 2: Guru]
Yo; I ain't one to succumb to no man, but to command
And scoop up the troops when it's time to take a stand
Emphatically, deep strategies leave casualties
I creep gradually, til everybody knows
That I got more flows than Rosebud got holes
The anger inside had me trapped
Til I got geared up with raps to tear you up like big gats
For big stacks, watch your back when I send em in
Caught you tremblin, my name and face you're rememberin
Several attempts, but nah bitch, you'll never win
Rhymes pierce your skin or maybe limbs we'll be severin
Take you to the mat, peep that, you should keep back
My ill-kid format will lay you flat like a doormat
That I walk on, I meditate while you talk on
And gossip, so I drop my hot shit; fully loaded Glock clips
So get the fuck out my block, kid
As nights turn to days, days go back to nights, we be speaking it right
And keeping it tight up in the street life
I meet life, head on, no holds barred
Born with a heart of gold, now mostly cold and scarred
En guard, choose your weapon, or get to steppin
Lyrical bullets make you dance from the trance you be kept in
Assessments are made before, and during combat
I master my hunger, blow the spot when I bomb cats
One of us, equals many of us
Disrespect one of us, you'll see plenty of us
Conflict, is what I predict
You and your fellas is mad jealous, attempting to flare
We cleverly stalked ya, your fam'll miss ya
The war's on, that's why we formed The Militia

Chorus

[Verse Three: Freddie Foxxx]
You niggas owe me for my rhymes, I come to collect
For you dope fiend niggas in rap, I here to inject, check
My style is butter baby, spread it around
But when you niggas don't flow it right and fuck up my sound
I get down; in '89 I spit a "buck" in the face
Of every MC that came in the place, a scar you'll never erase
MC's are only recognized for their flows
I'm worldwide for the bitches, that I turned into hoes
You heard me spit it on Jew-elz, that's how it goes
For all them faking ass niggas and how I bust up their nose
And while your, nose is drippin, and drainin blood
I'll be standing over you screamin, "Nigga, WHAT, WHAT?! Nigga WHAT?!"
Niggas feel my presence, like I'm right in their palm
Cause a stormy day is coming, when you see me so calm, it's on
No more twin Glocks, they jam up my plays
Now its twin .40 calibre Walther PPK's
I'm in the control of my game, you must respect me like The Ref
Uh-huh, you disrespect *gun clicks* you get the tech
I turn you fake niggas on and off, like I'm the clapper
I rob so many niggas, they should call me Jack the Rapper
I'll the illest nigga doing this, dead or alive
Gloria Gaynor on you motherfuckers, I Will Survive
You can try to come at me, but do you want the kick back?
You step inside the cage of a pit, and you get bit back, huh
My war is so tight, my drama so ill
Beef with me hangs around like a unpaid bill
I push these lyrics through any MC, and make it burn
So the niggas who be rhyming next, will miss a turn
When you speak of who's the dopest MC, I don't come up
But when you speak of who's the livest MC, I stay one up, what's up?
I got stripes like you got strikes and bogus mikes
Do what bitch niggas do best *UTFO sample* bite
Y'all niggas can't make up a law that I don't overrule, overthrow
Preem' brought Bumpy this track so I'mma let you know
Before I slide I'mma leave you this jewel
Even mechanics walk around with they tools
It's the MilitiaYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Trick like crazy, bills rather large
You go back to the crib screamin like you in charge
I'm in that black car smokin blunts in your yard
Suspect, no guts to be hard
Take you to the river tie your ass to the log
Better yet, how about splittin your wig
That's just the way it is, the way it is

Where the real niggas at ?
What? Who got my back ?

[Verse 1]
And who will be ready for war at all costs
Position themselves to take the fake heads off
And who will really cock their weapon
Not their mouth when it's time for you and your team to go all out
And who in the face of danger keeps quiet
Never snitch, never give up your mans and them for shit
And who will rock my product like kane ?
Push that shit like rocks to the top of the game
Is it you? And who got my back like a cape?
So I can be a superhero, get more money like De Niro
And who will never sell their soul
Or their asshole for the dollar if you feelin' me niggas
Then holla and who sees this shit through veteran eyes
And for hip-hop to be more than Ready To Die
Surprise it's not many, real niggas left my mind's
Designed to get while you step in facts

[Hook]
And who's gonna get my back? Oh!
And who's gonna bust their gat, for me?
And who's gonna feel like I feel, keepin' it real like gangstas do, who?

[Verse 2]
And who's gonna support their seeds
Be a father to their child
And still live Big Willy Style
And who's gonna walk their dogs till their tongues hang out
Till world wide your joints bang out
And who's gonna keep the faith in ya niggas
Not get gassed and caught up with the silly gold diggers
And who will never hate, never be an ingrate
Never whine or cry whether free or upstate
And who on steroids all muscled up
Won't rub us the wrong way and get their ass fucked up
And who will write their own rhyme
Time after time, hot shit that leaves the comp' dumb and blind
If it's you then you came to the right place
And if it's not you get smashed with a brick in the face

[Hook]
And who gonna get my back, who?
And who gonna bust their gat, who?
And who gonna feel like I feel, keepin' it real, like gangstas do, who?

And ... gonna get my back, who?
And ... gonna bust their gat, who?
And who gonna feel like I feel, keepin' it real, like gangstas do, who?

And who gonna get my back, who?
And ... gonna busts their gat, who?
And who gonna feel like I feel, keepin' it real, like gangstas do, who?

Who got me, who?
Who got me?
