[Verse 1: Eminem]
I ain't gonna eat, I ain't gonna sleep
Ain't gonna breathe, 'til I see what I wanna see
And what I wanna see, is you go to sleep in the dirt
Permanently, you just being hurt
This ain't gonna work for me
It just wouldn't be, sufficient enough
Cause we, are just gonna be, enemies
As long as we breathe, I don't ever see, either of us
Coming to terms, where we can agree
There ain't gonna be, no reasoning, speaking wit me
You speak on my seed, then me, no speak-a ingles
So we gonna beef, and keep on beefing, unless
You're gonna agree, to meet with me in the flesh
And settle this face to face, and you're gonna see
A demon unleashed in me, that you've never seen
And you're gonna see, this gangster pee on himself
I see you D12, and thanks, but me need no help
Me do this one all by my lonely
I don't need fifteen of my homies
When I see you, I'm seeing you, me and you only
We never met, but best believe you gon' know me
When I'm this close, to see you exposed as phony
Come on bitch, show me, pick me up, throw me
Lift me up, hold me, just like you told me
You was gonna do, that's what I thought, you're pitiful
I'm rid of you, all of you, Ja, you'll get it too!

[Hook: Eminem (DMX)]
Now go to sleep bitch
Die, motherfucker, die
Ugh, time's up, bitch, close ya eyes
Go to sleep, bitch (what)
Why are you still alive
How many times I gotta say, close ya eyes
And go to sleep bitch (what)
Die motherfucker die, bye, bye, motherfucker, bye, bye
Go to sleep bitch (what)
Why are you still alive
Why, die motherfucker, ah, ah, ah
Go to sleep bitch

[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
We got you niggas nervous
On purpose, to hurt your focus
You's not MC's, you's worthless
You's not them G's, you's a circus
You's no appeal, please
You's curtains, you use words Kool Herc slurred in two thousand third
You's purping, you's no threat, who's ya serving
When lyrically oughta bury you beneath the dirt when
You fuck with a label overseeing the Earth
Shady muthafucka, O. Trice's birth
And as I mold, I become a curse
So we can put down the verse, take it to the turf
Cock and squeeze, and he who reach the hearse is he who
Depicts fiction in his verse
And as I breathe, and you be deceased
The world believe you deceived just to speak
You's not the streets, you's the desk
Use not your chest nigga, use a vest
Before two's choose ya rest, you chose death
Six feet deep, nigga, that's the depth

[Hook]

[Verse 3: DMX]
Hey dog, I'mma walk like a beast, talk like the streets
I'mma stay blazing New York with the heat
Stalk on the beat, walk wit MY feet
Understand my pain, the rain ain't sleet
Peep how I'm moving, peep where I'm going
Shit don't seep, then sleep not knowing
But I'mma keep growing, getting larger than life
Easy going with the same one that started the fight
He be knowing how dog get, when dog don't bite
Tried to show him the dog shit, it's dog for life
Grand Champ, and my Blood Line is tight
Cuz it's all good, it's all right
Niggas tried to holla, but couldn't holla back
Now they gots to swallow, everything in the sac
Blood Line, and, we can go track for track
Damn, dog, why'd you have to do them niggas like that

[Hook]

[Outro: Eminem]
All you motherfuckers, take that
Here, take this too, bitch
Uh, Uh, Uh, Uh, Wahoo
We're killing all you motherfuckers dead, all of you
Fake ass gangsters
No more press
No more press
Rot, motherfuckers, rot
Decay, in the dirt, bitch, in the motherfucking dirt
Die nameless, bitch, die nameless, no more fame
Ahh, hahahaha
Yo X, come on man, Obie, let's go, haha[Verse 1: Eminem]
They ask me am I okay, they ask me if I'm happy
Are they asking me that because of the shit that's been thrown at me
Or am I just a little snappy and they genuinely care?
Doody, most of my life it's just been me and you there
And I continuously stare at pictures of you
I never got to say I love you as much as I wanted to but I do
Yeah I say it now and you can't hear me, what the fuck good does
That do me now, but somehow I know you're near me in presence
Oh, I went and dropped some presents off for Easter to them
Two little beautiful boys of yours to try to ease their minds a little
And dog you'll never believe this
But Sharonda actually talks to me now, Jesus
And everyone else is just tryna pick up the pieces
Man how could you touch so many fucking lives and just leave us
They say grievance has a way of affecting everyone different
If it's true how the fuck am I supposed to get over you, difficult as it sounds

[Hook: Obie Trice]
Doody, I dropped a tear in a rhyme
The day you find it is the day I stop missing DeShaun
Holten, it was written, it was woven for a soldier to leave so suddenly
Got me wide open
How could God take a soul so dope and
Turn around leave us all heartbroken?
Know that you're saying keep going, be a man, no emotion
It's your duty, till we meet again, Doody

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Doody, that's what we'd call each other, I don't know where it came from
But it just stuck with us, we was always brothers
Never thought about each other's skin colors
'Til one day we was walking up the block in the summer
It was like 90 degrees I was catching a sunburn
Tryna walk under the trees just to give me some comfort
I'm moaning I just wanna get home when I look over and your shirt is off
I'm like you gonna fry and you're like, "No I won't, I'm black stupid
Black people they got melatonin
In their skin we donâ€™t burn," meanwhile my face is glowing and I felt
Like I'm on fire and the entire time you're just laughing at me
And snapping at me with your shirt, bastard
And I still have to get you back for that shit
And by the way them Playboy rings, my mother stole from you
Well Nate finally got 'em back shit
It musta been at least 16 years ago, well I put 'em in your cask-oww
Moving past it, it still ain't registered yet
But you can bet your legacy they'll never forget
The Motor City, Motown, hip hop vet, Hip Hop Shop, dreads
It don't stop there, yeah, as difficult as it sounds

[Hook: Obie Trice]

[Verse 3: Eminem]
And this might sound a little strange but I'mma tell it
I found that jacket that you left at my wedding and I picked it up to smell it
I wrapped it up in plastic until I put it in glass
And hang up in the hallway so I can always look at it
And as for all me and D12 we feel like fuck rap
It feels like our general just fucking died in our lap
We shut off all our pagers, all our cell numbers is changed
Our two-ways are in the trash so some cats will have to find a new way
And I know it feels like the dreams will die with you today
But the truth is they're all still here and you ain't
Purple Gang, you gotta keep pressing on
Don't ever give up the dream dog, I got love for you all
And Doody, it's true you bought people together who never
Woulda been in the same room if it wasn't for you
You were the peacemaker Doody, I know sometimes you were moody
But you hated confrontation and truly hated the feuding
But you were down for yours whenever it came to scrapping
If it had to happen, it had to happen, believe me
I know you're the one who taught me to throw them bows back on Dresden
From making cars to paintballing and getting arrested
To sitting across from each other in cells laughing and jesting
They tried to hit us for five years for that, no question
I guess them hookers and bums that we shot up
Didn't show up for court so we got off on a technicality, left sweatin'
Me, you and what's his face, I forgot his fucking name
Shame he even came to your funeral, he betrayed our team
And if I see him again I'mma punch him in the fucking face
And that's on Hallie Jade, Whitney Lane and Alaina's name
I let the pistol bang once just to lick a shot in the air
For you and pour some liquor out for you with Obie in the parking lot
Of 54 just before we were supposed to get in cars
To come and see you, once more difficult as it sounds

[Obie Trice]
Doody![Eminem] Obie yo
[Obie] I'm sick
[Eminem] Damn, you straight dog?

[Hook]
That's why I ain't got no time
For these games and stupid tricks
All these bitches on my dick
That's how dudes be getting sick
That's how dicks be getting drips
Falling victims to this shit
From these bitches on our dicks
Fucking chickens with no ribs
That's why I ain't got no time

[Verse 1: Obie]
Yo, I woke up, fucked up off the liquor I drunk
I hadda bag of the skunk, one and last night's tunk
Pussy residue was on my penis, Denise, from the cleaners
Fucked me good, you should've seen us
Big booty bitch, switch unbearable
French role styling, body like a stallion
Sizing up the figure, while my shit gettin' bigger
Debating on to fuck her, do I wanna be her nigga
Caressing this bitch, plus I'm checking out them tits
Sipping on that fine shit, I ain't use to buying
I gotta hit it from behind, it's mandatory
Like taking ho's money, but that's another story
For surely your pussy on toast, after we toast
Our clothes fell like Bishop in juice
The womb beater, clean pussy eater, inserting my jock
In that spot hotter than the hottest block, don't stop
Response I got when I was knocking it
Clocks steading ticking, kinky finger licking
And carrying on, semen at my tip when she moans
I gotta slow down before I cum soon
And work that nigga, like a slave owner
When I dropped off my outfit, she knew I wanted to bone her
She foaming at the lips, the ones between the hips
Pubic hair's looking like some sour cream dip
Without the nacho, my dick hit the spot though
Pussy tighter than conditions of us black folks
We in the final stretch, the last part of sex
I bust a fat ass nut then I woke up next
Like, what the fuck is going on here?
This bitch evaporated, pussy and all just picked up and vacated
And now I'm frustrated cause my dick was unprotected
And doctor Wesley telling me I really got that shit, fuck

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Now I don't wanna hit no women but this chicks got it coming
Someone better get this bitch before she gets kicked in the stomach
And she's pregnant, but she's egging me on, begging me to throw her
Off the steps on this porch, my only weapon is force
And I don't wanna resort to violence of any sort
But whys she shoving me for doesn't she love me no more?
Wasn't she hugging me four minutes ago at the door?
Man I'm this close to going toe to toe with this whore
What would you do if she was telling you she wants a divorce
She's having another baby in a month and it's yours
And you found it isn't cause this bitch has been visiting
Someone else and sucking his dick and kissing you on the lips
When you get back to Michigan, now the plot has thickened 'n worse
Cause you feel like you've been sticking your fucking dick in a hearse
So you're paranoid at every little cold that you get
Ever since they sold you this shit, you've been holding your dick
So you go to the clinic, sweating every minute you're in it
Then the doctor comes out looking like Dennis the Menace
And it's obvious to everyone in the lobby, it's AIDS
He ain't even gotta to call in you the office to say it
So you jet back home, cause you gone get that ho
When you see her, you're gonna bend her fucking neck back yo
Cause you love her, you never would've expect that blow
Obie told you the scoop, how could she stoop that low?
Jesus, I don't believe this bitch works at the cleaner's
Bringing me home diseases swinging from Obie's penis
She's so deceiving, shit this ho's a genius, she geed us

[Hook]

I'm busy, yeah, fuck these bitches
Fuck em all, get money
Ha, Shady Records
Wow, Obie Trice
Eminem mother fucker
New millennium shit, yeah
Turn this shit off, turn this shit the fuck off[Eminem]
Hailie, what do you want to be when you grow up baby

[Hailie]
I don't know
But I don't want to grow up to be like Ja Rule's little dirty-ass kids

[Eminem and Hailie]
Ah ha, yeah, c'mon
G-G-G-G-G-G-G Unit
Hailie, come here baby, bring Daddy his Oscar
We're gonna shove it up Ja Rule's ass

[Swift]
I'm about to get rid of some hoes, it's simple
I'm quick to murder ink with lead and I ain't talkin' bout a pencil
Look at what the fuck you done got into
I see you found your niche, you just a bitch with a menstrual
Claimin' you a murderer and you spelled it wrong
You put E before the D cause that's all you on
You on Pac's dick, you a replica guy
If he was still alive you would never get by
All you do is cry, bitch keep it real
Life is more than imitatin' niggas and eatin' pills
And what kind of motherfucker ruins three deals
That another nigga got you, they didn't see skills
And I ain't playin', you a brother gettin' cheated
And Ja Rule be prayin' on his cover cause he need it
And all you niggas hatin', shut you mouths
It's just that real niggas ain't buyin' that shit y'all put out

[Obie Trice]
Doe, rae, me but we don't sing motherfuckas
So Murder Inc do your thing motherfuckers
You unleashed on a team who expects nothin' less
Than R&B comin' from that regime
Regime is a little extreme
Neck and neck with soldiers, motherfuckin' Marines
Ja sold his soul to sing
Weave eye-witness team on the TV screen, chase the greed
Now that you've embraced the green
Don't fuck with the triple beams
You's a motherfuckin' actor, slash Pac impersonatin' rapper
Slash Billie Holiday, how it happen
Artist and repertoire saw him in action
Pac assassination, Def Jam grabbed him
Told him reenact him, you go platinum
They seen it for sure, I know that Afeni Shakur
Don't enjoy Jeffrey Atkins reenactin' her boy
So I'm click-clackin' this toy
Mash and destroy, Shady slash Aftermath and Detroit, mothafucker

[Hook: Eminem]
Doe rae me, fa-so-la-ti-da
Don't blame me cause you washed up lost your spot
Mama-say-mama-sa-ma-macosa
Ja quit playin', knock it off, you're not 2Pac
Don't hate me, I'm too hot and you're not
Shooting at me, with the only shot you got
Ja quit playin' knock it off you're not 2Pac
You'll get popped poppin' all that shit you pop

[Kuniva]
Now we can get past the mean mugs and get to the slugs
To the grievance and the crying and the intimate hugs
We don't take you serious nigga, you shook you half of a half-way crook
Get off X dick, go sing a hook nigga
And you can't replace the late great one
And when you gone you only gon' be the late fake one
Nigga please, stick to the script
Before the guns stick to the clip
And Benzino you ain't shit but a bitch
Fuckin' old-ass ignorant innocent lookin' senior citizen
Built up, slap you like Grimace, all sensitive
Wait a minute, hold on
Is it me or do he look like a banana with braids and clothes on
A bitch-made man
Now how you gonna connect with them short ass arms like a Tyrannosaurus Rex
You niggas can scream holler and curse
Go ahead and respond and pull that pen and pad up outta your purse

[Proof]
Slim didn't send Proof to get at the wankstas
He told me to let loose and spit at the gangstas
What up Gotti, and this little war you pushed on
Put your ear to the ground for stepping on bush stones
What's wrong, didn't think we strong with real niggas
Roll like a boss in the streets they still feel us
It's real business y'all ain't caught the concept
You talkin' nonsense to walking bomb threats
Contact was blown by Benzetta in The Source
Threaten at the boss you gon' see me on your porch
Now Irv got the nerve to try to serve on us
But Detroit niggas early and ain't scurred to bust

[Kon Artis]
Word to my nigga Bugz, punks like you get beat up
Stomped unconscious and smacked with the heater
This rap cookie monster gets jabbed in the tonsils
With dicks so much that he should be fixed with a vagina
Who's behind you
Cadillac Pac or that transvestite
That dress like a Lil Kim fox
You're just like a little windbox
Press tight on the trigger of this Glock
Swallow that little shit you got left to help you eat
You knock Pac's songs without love to help you sleep
You got shot in your video trying mock Pac
You Mockaveli, get your own identity

[Hook (Refrain in background)]
Don't you never say my little girl's name in a song again
Fuckin' punk-pussy bitch
I'll fuck you up boy
Never
Don't you never in your motherfuckin' life
I'll choke the shit out of you little motherfuckin' midget
Hailie'll whip your motherfuckin' ass

[Outro- Obie Trice]
That's right motherfuckers
Shady records, whatchu know about it
Fuck Benzino, fuck Ja Rule
Nigga, this Obie Trice right here talkin' to you motherfuckers
Ja Rule punk ass, yeah
Fuckin' Soul 4 Real ass
Nigga, that's Soul 4 Real
That the nigga from Soul 4 Real
Candy Rain-ass nigga
He got a deal now he rappin'
You don't know what's, faggot-ass motherfuckers
Get money to all my real niggas, man
Obie Trice, D-12, G Unit, 50 Cent
Hailie Jade

[Hailie]
Daddy, is Ja Rule taller than me?

[Eminem]
No honey, you guys are the same size[Intro: Eminem]
If there's any bitches in this room
Then there's something I gotta say
For all the fools, who fell for the first
Girl who comes their way
I've been down that road and, now I'm back
Sitting on square one
Tryna pick myself up where I started from

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
I never would have thought that I'd see you out of control
Even though, my penis was deep down in your hole
You should know between us, we was like mates of soul
Nothing could intervene us, especially no hoes
You was more so the chalant type I chose to more shows
Haunted you nights I suppose, that's how it go
With time spent, emotion grows
In the beginning friends, we decided to roll
So who's responsible when you get excited, explode
And Obie's grinning, then you invite that Obie's cold
But bitches they gon' talk, niggas they gon' hate
We established this way before we became mates
So what's required is that you chill with all that fire
Get your desire when I retire, and

[Hook: Eminem]
"Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine"
I, never thought I'd find, someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right, cause you just crossed the line
"Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine"

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I used to say I never met a girl like you before
Still ain't got a fucking clue as to who you truly are
Almost went as far as introducing you to my daughters
'til you went as far as going and snooping through my drawers
Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for
Can't believe I almost flew the coop for some stupid whore
You used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours
All I ever wanted from you was a few booty calls
If you recall I used to treat you like a groupie broad
When we fucked I refused to even take my jewelry off
But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off
It was a shock, it struck me as odd, but it turned me on
You started getting moody on me, pretty soon we'd argue
And the ruder you got, the more beautiful you got to me
And whoulda even knew that, who woulda even thought possibly
Cupid could shoot another one of them goddamn darts at me
It's true that I got shot in the heart
But when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are
But see, when you're in it it's too hard to see
'til you pull up and see some other dude's car parked and
Reach up onto the seat as your heart starts to beat
Before you make a decision that's life altering
And just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave
You hear them words echoing, almost haunting, that taunting ring

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Stat Quo]
Ha ha, yeah right bitch
Spend some time with my dick
In most cases - Stat's attitude is "fuck a bitch"
My only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch
But you was diff-er-ent, thought we shared a covenant
Even held your hand in pub-a-lic, we suffering because of this
Shorty on some whole 'nother other shit
Trying to play slick, thinking I'mma trick off grip
I'll admit, I was caught in the mix, down to commit
Feeding you the best of me, I shoulda fed you piss
We started off closer than close, but who coulda predicted to know
Your trifling ways woulda stopped our growth
And the final result, back in that same boat
I asked myself, do I love these hoes? NOPE!

[Verse 4: 50 Cent]
Em introduced us, 50 this is Tanya, Tanya this is 50
Then slid off and left her to kick it wit' me
I complimented her I said, "you have very nice lips"
With my imagination, I could see her suckin' my dick
We played the phone game, a week later, shit changed fast
Had her comin over in a cab to give me some ass
Downtown Manhattan on the balcony stare at the skyline
Penthouse full of imported shit, you know how I grind
She got to talkin' talking like an opportunist too
Why talk when suckin' my dick is the real career move
Said she's an inspiring actress, she do videos for practice
Yea yea know how many times I done heard that shit?

[Hook][Verse 1: Obie Trice]
Niggas, I'm still grinding (yeah), I still hearing those sirens
I'm still getting chased by those lights
Only the light's lime, and my mic's on
And my time is none, because I'm writing more
And I ain't here to meet a soul in this business
I'm here to eat, speak, until these ho's feel this
I ain't gonna let you derail me, man
I got Young Kobie homey, you gotta let go of Obie
Cause Obie be back, (going nowhere, man) we got them craps going on
And that yac going on, soon as a nigga touch down, back from touring
It's whatever, put that on the cheddar, man
But in the meantime, it's Jimmy Iovine time
Chase cheese, rhyme 'til my voice give out
This is it my niggas, this what we boast about
Now I'm here, so shut your motherfucking mouth, and show me love, bitch

[Hook]
I just wanna love ya, for the rest of my life (I don't love you, bitch)
I wanna hold you in the mornin, hold you through the night
(Right we wanna love alcohol, we wanna love guns, we wanna love money
We don't love no bitches, though)
I just wanna love, for the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the mornin, hold you through the night

[Verse 2: Eminem]
There's a certain mystique when I speak, that you notice
Cause it's sort of unique cause you know it's me
My poetry's deep, and I'm Stillmatic, the way I flow to this beat
You can't sit still, it's like trying to smoke crack and go to sleep
I'm strapped, it's known any minute I could snap
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped
I bully these rappers so bad lyrically
It ain't even funny, I ain't even hungry, it ain't even money
You can't pay me enough for you to play me
It's cockamanie you just ain't zany enough to rock with Shady
My noodle is cock-a-doodle, my clock's coo-coo
I got screws loose, yea the whole kit and caboodle, I'm just brutal
It's no rumor, I'm numero uno, assume it
There's no more humor in it, you know
I'm rolling with a swollen bowling ball in my bag
You need a fag to come and tear a near hole in my ass, you better love me, bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
My buzz is crazy in the hood, they holla my name
If it ain't about the flow, it's 'bout the stones and the chain
If I was you, I'd love me too, I roll like a boss
Nine eleven Porsche same color as cranberry sauce
I ain't gon' front, I thought R. Kelly was the shit
Let me find out he fucking 'round with Bow Wow bitch
Niggas eating popcorn right, rewinding the tape
Now shorty mama in precinct, hollering rape
I'm convinced, man, something really wrong with these ho's
I thought Lil' Kim was hot, 'til she start fucking with her nose
I used to listen to Lauryn Hill, and tap my feet
Then the bitch put out a CD and didn't have no beats
That boy D'Angelo, he determined not to fail
That nigga went butt-ass, for his record to sell
My back shots 'll help Ashanti hit them high notes
And Big Ben taught Charli B'More to deep throat (yea)

[Hook][Intro: Tony Yayo]
Yeah!
You rocking with the Talk of New York Tony Yayo
Shady Aftermath and Soul Assassins
Here we go!

[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
Niggas know what I'm about out here
I don't toot my own horn cause I don't have to
You could run your mouth I don't care
But if you get too close I'm gon' clap you
It's too real out here to be scared
A real nigga gonna do whatever he has to
A man is a last thing you should fear
It ain't considered a crime unless they catch you
We all die one day

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
Niggas when I step up in a bar (uh huh), faggots wanna look (what?)
Like you motherfuckers got Obie Trice shook
Like I'mma stand here as a man and
Let some queer ass, funny looking nigga get the upper hand (ha ha ha!)
I got issues, got no time, got guns that mourn nigga's moms (yeah!)
Shoot up clubs and destroy nigga's vibes (come on!)
Everybody running for their motherfucking lives (AHHHHHH!!!)
Tough club niggas, we leave early, cock back surely
Open up your fade your gray brain meets Motor City pave'
Your nervous system still twitch off Jay-Z
O's an animals skirts get murked
Don't ever let a nigga tell you slugs don't hurt
Don't ever let a nigga tell you to play the bar hard
Trust in God cause you's about to get catch a bullet scar
I give a fuck where you from, who you be with
Keep this a secret {*whispers*} right by the nuts
A 4-5 that'll light niggas up and this 4-5 high make not give a fuck

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
But as long as I'm here I'm gonna grab checks
And make my cash stretch longer than giraffe necks
Poverty'll make your ass bet
My words touch niggas in jail make them wanna finish they last set
They say you live by the gun, you die by the next nigga gun
If that's the case then get a bigger one
You don't think I pack the pump cause I'm out the hood
That's a stereotype like everybody that's black can jump
I'm in the white mink, the fabric is done
Got rings like Mike, Bird, Magic, and them
Out of Dallas to the palace where the Mavericks is from
Living lavish I'm established, so the cabbage'll come
I'm in the clouds, you don't see me on the train
I travel first class, you ain't even got a TV on your plane
You should be easy on my name cause I ain't going back and forth
Your boss and your captain soft (BITCH!)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Cause we gon' bring it to anybody who want it, you want it, you gon' get it
Name 'em we gon' hit 'em chew 'em up and spit 'em out
{*Hoch spit*} Too much venom and if you roll with 'em
We gon' fuck you up with 'em
I got too much momentum moving in my direction to lose
My shoes will explode as soon as you go to step in them, (BOOM)
You know how we do it when we do how we do it when we come through
G-Unit, D-1-2 and Obie we all move like assassins
Ski mask and gloves consider this as a warning
Disaster comes faster than you can react to it, just ask Muggs
But we are fizast, fuck your little bitch ass up
We are not killers, my vato will have you shot, though
Dragged through the barrio and fucked like Kim Osorio's
Little sorry ho ass, go ask B-Real
We burn Source covers like fucking Cypress Hill
Did in the 90s, when you was in diapers still
Shady Records you better believe the hype is real
This is no joke, I don't smoke
But I toke enough secondhand to make my fucking P.O. choke
I'm an OG, you're fucking with a G.I. Joe
Bia Bia, mia mio a vida loc'
I'm a psycho, Mariah ain't got shit on me
When I retire I'll be spitting baby food on people
A tent siged on her ranch huddle up next to her
With Hello Kitty slippers on, humping her legs
You ever had your cap peeled back or your shit pushed in?
I put my blade in you like a fucking pin cushion
Slice your ear clear off, Smirnoff and Hen, dog
I'll show you to kill a fucking man like Sen Dog (Bring it, bring it, bring it back!)
Nobody told you that I'm loco, Ã©se?
I lack every sane chemical in my membrane
I'm Slim Shay...D and the 'D' is for deez nuts
And you can get each one for free so feast up
I'll pee in a cup for three months
I'm having an E party for Easter please come
Cause we gon'

[Verse 4: 50 Cent]
We gon' bring it to anybody who want it, you want it, you gon' get it
You name 'em and we'll hit 'em, chew 'em up and spit 'em out {*spits*}
Too much venom and if you roll with 'em
We gon' fuck you up with 'em
You can do all them push ups to pump up your chest
I got a twelve gauge Mausberg to pump up your chest
Have you gasping for air after that shell hit your vest
Fear me like you fear God cause I bring death
Silverback gorilla in the concrete jungle
I'm the strongest around, you know how I get down
I watch gangsta flicks and root for the bad guy
And turn it off before it end cause the bad guy die
If you trying to buy guns, I'm the nigga to look to
So what they got bodies on them? They still look new
You can raise your voice like you fitting to touch something
When I raise my knife, shit, I'm fitting to cut something
They say I walk like Ron O'Neal, and talk like Goldie
If the bitch think I love her, the bitch don't know me
{*laughing*}

Put your life in perspective, you're killin 'em
Envious niggas stay jealousy driven
Niggas need to be listenin

[J-Hill]
(ONE, BY, ONE) It's one reason why I still let you breathe
It's one reason why the fuckin tec won't squeeze

[Hook]

[Proof] Ten jewels...[Intro]
Get the fuck up, muthafucka

[Verse 1]
Ayo, when I step up in the bar everybody hit the fuckin' floor
Lucky mothafuckas make it to the door
Cause when I spit on mic's I spit raw
Which cause confusion from the bar to the dance floor
I keep the club owner vexed
Cause he gotta pay me when I spit plus replace a lotta shit
Niggas get to wilding
When my words echoes the room like (Get your hand out my pockets)
You sock shit while my topics rocking
I'm banned from clubs cause of my toxic tonsils
Loud speaking like a fuckin' sports announcer
I spit the Blaha 'til you rush the bouncer
Or rush the mothafucka in your way who's bouncing
You know O. Trice get the gats pronouncing

[Hook]
Get live mothafucka when I speak mothafucka
Out your seat mothafucka, I'mma reach mothafuckas
Shady Records until I sleep, mothafucka
Obie Trice, nothing but street, muthafucka
Tear this bitch up 'til you bleed, mothafucka
I wouldn't give a fuck who you be, mothafucka
Punk, pussy, bitch or G, mothafucka
Adrenaline rush before you leave, mothafucka

[Verse 2]
When I speak I blow out your tweeters, a dog
Show out with speakers, roll out with heaters
I'm just a animal eating the game
Jump a monkey, fuck yeah, Obie's the name
I roll solo never been a ho, though
Keep gats vocal when cats act loco
Where you at when I'm moving the crowd
You get trampled, mashed on Detroit style
Up out your seats, pump out the E's
Up the beats, the crowd "Obie, please"
Where my niggas at, smoking them trees
Off the cognac finger fucking a skeez
That's how it is when you party with me
You don't like it? You L7 like a square be

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
And since I came, I've rearranged the place with blaze
Stage dive with Colt Seavers, DNA
I'm so addicted to getting niggas lifted
Drunk off the liquid, O. Trice, the misfit
Dousing the crowd with piss and bile
We underground, mothafucka fix your frown
I be the boy with the whiskey toy
Offa whiskey, you never been to skeet before
So, throw up your hands and peep out your man's
When I come through, next quarter Trice intervene use
And trust, I'm attacking it
I cook up the hot shit like Ainsley Harriott
That's why I'm so miraculous and Obie gets you niggas pumped up
I'll see you next coliseum, chump
That's right, it's your Obie Trice fucked up off E's and weed

[Hook][Intro: Obie Trice] + Nate Dogg
Trell
Say niggas in Detroit don't make beats
Straight out the hood nigga
My nigga Trell, Obie Trice, Shady Records

[Nate Dogg]
From hard times (All of my life)
Got this lady on my mind
To good times (All of my days)
Wanna hit it all the time
She's mine (struggled with strife)
I was down and locked away
She's mine (thought about it everyday)
From hard times

[1st Verse]
You know a nigga wanna touch your body
We can keep in touch have an after party
Know you wanna fuck cause your acting naughty
You see us in the matress probably, ha
Wanna be involved cause the entourage I'm endulged in
You say you love my dirty drawers you're all in
Wanna sleep with the star, be baby mom
Eat lobster, see where you're coming from
Cause hey that nigga got dick for days
There ain't too many niggas blessing O's ways
I guess I just get better with old age
Cause in my hey, puss made me say "May day"
Anyway, today I'm a different human being
I crush 'em, make 'em scream
It's nothing, ain't a thing
Fronting like the dick ain't off the chain
Slicing niggas tires and things

[Hook: Nate Dogg]]
(From hard times, All of my life)
At the after party, we can get naughty watchin your body
(To good times, All of my days)
Get the shit started, coke and bacardi
Get juice and gin, and up off that ready to roll
(It's my time)
At the after party, it's a private party
What happens at the party stays at the party
(Moonshine)
Girl go and party, back up that body
Into my body, girl let's go
(From hard times)

[2nd Verse]
You know I'm somewhere where I can ease my mind be
On some island, dime piece beside me
No paparazzi, eyeing at hiney
But I am right behind she
Wanna bump and grind, crying saying I'm all up in her side
Bringin down her menustration cycle
Girl I lay pipe the the right, pipe to the left
Pipe all night, a pipe dream right
O Trice advice your type
If it ain't him it's a nigga in my clique you like
If the misses insists on the dick tonite
We throw assists like Scott Pip and Mike
You blow a kiss on my tip you just might
Get a whiff off the kid up in your windpipe
Now see that insight, it excites
Cause she's undressing for that sex right?

[Hook]

[3rd Verse]
Take time out my hectic schedule
Just to give you the pleasure your request fo'
When I hit your spine that's how you measure O
Tell your girlfriends you ain't had it like this before
Now your girlfriends all up in the mits of O
Wanna be mistress, all cause a few extra inches
Blew back your entrance, you lack experience
New jack, my crew ran through that for instance
We can fuck from dusk til dawn
It's no discussion who's nuts your on
She's such in a rush to cum
Wanna choke on a dong, like it's a bong
And what is he doin, he making her moan
Make her wanna leave that mothafucka she got back home
All O knowing is to keep hoes going
Enjoying O Trice's groin

[Hook]
(All of my life)
Got this lady on my mind
(To good times, all of my days)
Wanna hit it all the time
(It's my time, struggle and strife)
I was down and locked away
(Moonshine)
Thought about it everday
(From hard times)Yeah, BME Black Market Entertainment
Obie Trice

Yeah, I then had some empty years
Lost a few peers even shed a few tears (Proof!)
For my niggas ain't here
But even from up there they whisper in a boy ear (ppsss)
Say Obie how dare you stand clear when you the realist nigga there
Bring fire Obidiah God admire ya (Dear God)
And I'm a servant of him from urban to Em
From Em to now what I'm deserving is slim (Nah)
Like BME ain't as urgent as them
I murdered every verse you purchased back then
Nothing rehearsed no acting
No reenactments "O" so actually
Actually it hurts trying to bring them back to me
When you the same person that made him platinum
Plus, (You!) only nigga did that where he rest
Schoolcraft Ave put a hole in ya chest (Yes)
Nope I'm not Drake of course I'm not Weezy I'm riding to K-Deezy
So why when I see where the cheese be
You don't receive me BME that's Obeezy
Don't it get it twisted like you internet niggas do
Shady that's my birth we'll always be crew (Always)
If we gotta take it back to Ja Rule
Back to Benzin-ho, we gon' do what it do
Bullet in my head loose screw still
My motor skills had to get another boost real
I'm living proof that a death certificate's not a definite
Unless you the nigga got my roof peeled
Watch his head play peek-a-boo
Through the scope on the pica-tinny rail
Richard Harrow Expires ya, no face
This a Broadway Empire, BME Believe you me, I wanna crossover
The aroma of the hood take a hold of a soldier
Then it take toll and turn to a odor
When you can't get it off ya
The labels they don't want ya
But this ain't Degrassi this is where the grass be
Forty four eight in weight and that's his last
Mama titty rotten and she wear a mask
Just to be in public or around the people she lovin'
They say I'm buggin' when I'm buzzin'
I ain't recovered but big ups to my brethren (Em!)
Still keep it in the cupboard bring that shit out
Need somethin I need to go bottoms upward
Bottoms upward, bottoms upward, bottoms upward, bottoms upward
Nospeakerz
Yeah I do beats do streets, BME
Ya'll act like I'm the only nigga that heard Guru speak
Let's get this money[Verse 1]
Ayo I'm focused, it's the locust
O. Trice is holding the soldiers, the prognosis
Probably why I rose from zero to hope
Cause I was wide eyed and open nosed on my approach
Nigga, hold the toast you provoke
44 Snub hugs my scrotum when I roll
Yes I hold my own, Swifty think you Deebo's clone
I'm aimin, watch I'm switchin to Damon
And Next Friday I can bet you's a changed man
When them thangs in hand, it's not a game man
I ghost ya, I bring ya much closer to Jehovah
Definition of a soldier, I told ya
I, hold the toast when I approach
It's close at all times by my side in the holster
O-ster roast ya, make me blow my composure
Pop, it's all over, when the 44 blows and goes a..

[Hook]
When I'm up in the club and these niggas, they wanna act tough
'til they get plugged, watch them bullets go...
Now you touched from a slug, huggin the streets like you in love
Your heart rate's like...
The ambulance arrive
They rush you to the 'spital, flyin by my ride, engine like...
Homie you just died, your family through crying
I pulled off a crime, just as quick as...

[Verse 2]
You could lose your face, in a fool's race
I pulled my tool first nigga, you was in second place
And second place just means you didn't react with haste
And this differentiates life where murder being the case
And since murder was the case, it just means niggas erase
Another black mother can't eat the food on her plate
Cause she ain't got the taste as if raising you was a waste
"Such a short span young man" said at your wake
First I'm a man, second I'm five eight
But size and weight won't give a nigga the upper hand
Cause when I pop, I give this up like Barry Sand
Sit in the can, he never ran like Barry Sand
Obie ain't playin, Obie got a plan
And the plan is not to be layin in earth's land
I will pop before the can and earth's land
You get shot for playin me less than a man, mothafucka

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Niggas get it twisted, liquor make 'em envision
That gangsterism is disrespecting a niggas wishes
Which is all that tough talk in front of bitches
Yeah you fifteen deep, the Desert E'll give ya stitches
And I can be all the bitches and hoes you wanna
But I warn ya the Glock could make it hot as California
You be popped on the corner, flesh meeting the coroner
O's in quarantine, cause no holes in me
An' since no holes in me, niggas take advantage
'til I manage to pull that hammer out, they start scattering
I'm no gangster, I'm a average man
But be damned if I let 'em do me savage man
Before that I'm strapped and will challenge him
Cock back and that gat will damage them
It's not a act, this is fact, this is how I'm programmed
This is me, what I'm about, this who I am, motherfucker

[Hook][Intro]
[Strached "Obie"]

[Hook: Timbaland]
He got a bad bitch, said she recognize a "G"
Said she want to roll and get to know Obie
Claming that she love everything that he do, heeeey
He got a bad bitch, said she recognize a "G"
Said she want to roll, and get to know Obie
Claming that she love, everything that he do, hey, hey

[Obie Trice]
Yes it's O. Trice, I done jumped outta heights
Writing to the microphone life, yeah this is right
This is less stringuest niggas, this is tight
This is more dividends niggas, get it right
Stomping like Timberlands niggas, a pair of Nikes
But this is more Timbaland nigga and Obie Trice
The combination is invading stations, air waves
And rest haven on your listeners membranes (woo!)
I done payed some change, I got Timbo
This is not a brainy thang, yo this is simple
Get your ass up and dance, to the tempo
Exchange your stiff frame, with that of a more limbo
Grab shorty sippin' on that Shirley Temple
With that ass hanging out, and pinch her on that pimple
On her ass hanging out, nigga advance
This a world of a night, better start with the pants

[Hook]

[Obie Trice]
Yeah, let's keep this shit in motion (motion)
Cause we gon hang out 'til we hung over then I.V. Profin
Adios when (os when)
I fucked them thighs, who influenced with the game that was spoken
I'mma make sure she open (open)
MÃ©nage-a-trois in these's days and times got my shit growing
And she's hoein' (hoein')
And I'm ignoring' the lies she throwing', how she won't perform?
I feed her a blunt throw on the "Quiet Storm"
She repeatedly cum, insistently all morn'
And she needed cause funs up in the purse not growin
Bitch beat it my one's you gets none (nada)
To feel she's treated as if a Playboy or lpay her dumb
I skeeted so bitch your Playboy is on the run
Deleted the bitch, outta direct connection
Thanks for calming' down, my erection, hun

[Hook]

[Obie Trice]
Yeah, I speak the words of experience (oh) lady I'm serious
Lyrics on my deliverance, is oh so vivid bitch
Oh no hoes up, hoes I spit it bitch (spit it)
Roll up, smoke up dro, and spit on this (spit it)
I'mma outta order cause I break the ice
And squirt liquid in your eyes, all you see is little guys
Swimming in women they claming they like my style
Treat 'em like Ike and ride (bitch!)
I don't a fuck I got the height, sure your right
I'm Barry White tonight (hey) you feeling' alright
Got a buzz and this huzzie saying O's her type
I take her to the high-end and strike (ahh)
Trick for hire, I'll never buy her to bite
Despite she tight, I'll tell the bitch you can have a nice life
See I'm working with these I's in this rhymes
It's I's, all's that not a aus-tin time

[Hook][Hook]
O,O,O,O,O
I think this
Obie Trice (7X)
O,O,O,O

[Obie Trice: Talking over Hook]
I'd like to reintroduce myself, haha
If you don't know by now. It's Obie Trice man

[1st verse]
I came from nothing solo, straight outta the dumpster hobo
Made him a monster, I was cultivatingly slanging that cocoa
Hated the po po, locally known as abominable snow-o
Later the big 4' rated the home where I made the dough grow
So on and so fo', the story of us urban negros
Created as equals we wouldn't have to be so eager to mistreat you
We as a people heated in evenings doing these evils
Gotta eat to, be cool, got a kid to feed did it reach you
Or did it seep thru? Or do I just speak thru the EQ just to say I got a hot sequel?
When niggas on the block gotta eat, gotta cop, gotta cop when they caught by the cops
Young 2Pac's, laid in the box or they age in a cell blocks, fade away
Brick walls, steel gates, can't wait for the day to be free, that's why I'm

[Hook]
[Obie talking over Hook]
Seen it, I done ate it, I done shit it
Slept it, lived it, now I spit it
Shady

[2nd verse]
Working that house off an no-doze, got an ounce to roll on
Trying to get rid of the pounds, I gotta whip the bounce, I gotta put that chrome on
Same old song, young nigga thats trying to get some where I come from
Funds, need 'em in abundance, whole bunch, only way a city boy function
In conjunction with selling this substance
Chips stay up, fuck it, glucks keep coming, take another pie out the oven
I'mma be hugging these corners till these corners corner me
But currently, I'm calculating this currency, urgency
Gotta earn a G, uphearnestly, up early when the birds'll sing
It's an emergency, never did occur to me, that the first and the third'll be
Such a thirst for me, life almost took a turn for the worst for me took to see
I finally had a purpose on Earth's surface the seed that was birthing me
[Obie] Gotta do a little soul searching and [Obie] myself personally
And to think all Em had to hear is one verse from me
To confirm and unblur my dreams
Best believe since burst on the scene, I'mma be here certainly
With no uncertainties, yes indeed, I'mma get this cheese and that's why he's

[Hook fades out]

[Obie talking over Hook]
That's why I'm
That's what made me
Haha
That's why I'm
Young black man in America
Get up and get yours nigga
I know you struggling man, I been there
I see you
Get up and get yours nigga
Ain't no looking back now[Intro: Adrian Rezza]
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Battle cry

I've been shot by my critics
Talked about by the cynics
Feel like my life's on display
Like the museum exhibits

Puts my life on the line
Invested years in these rhymes
The street's thirst and they need it
Now hear my battle cry

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
O-Trice, back, at it
They don't wanna see him platinum
They just wanna see him brraaatted
They just wanna see him tec something Kwame Kilpatrick
Get next to him
So they can be the first to rat it
Savage, put him in a cascet
Categorize him, say Cheers was a classic
That's it, as if
He ain't bring the city to the masses
Minus Mathers, by my name is a asterisk
Like the craft ain't shown them where the cash at
Like my past, so I half step
Like I ain't work the bag on the ave
I swear they ass backwards
Let them put a nigga in the trash
O has fought, as you should
Never mind a player hater, as long as you good
Never change, gutter
So you can downplay my name, O still the same
Come on

[Hook: Adrian Rezza x2]
Keep going, keep going on
Keep going, keep going on
This my battle cry, battle cry

I've been waiting with patience
In the dark like a vagrant
Determining this circus
The fans want entertainment
My wings have been clipped, but now I'm ready to fly
In the heavens with angels
While devils wished I died

[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
O-Trice, back, at it
I ain't never came whack
All I ever gave's crack
All I ever gave's back
Ain't a human being on this earth say opposite that
You can misconstrue what he do
Cuz he cruise in an automobile or two
I know how to trap
I know how to double-up
Been doubled-back
No matter the circus stands, see I emerge from that
Used to serve the bundles, now the verse intact
Used to worship onions, now I service rap
There's certain cats uncertain with that
Rather see him serve his dirt nap
Like I deserve them curses
Like I don't speak in cursive
Like I ain't got a purpose
Beast of the streets
Dope stay on O-Trice's person

[Hook: Adrian Rezza x3]

[Outro: Obie Trice]
BME, Obie Trice, 2011, Bottoms Up
You know
Some days you the dog, some days you the hydrant
Gotta keep moving[Hook]
Nigga we up, we don't give a fuck
We gon' keep holding this shit down
Nigga raise up, you can get bucked
Gangstas around
Got the world in a flux, all on the nuts
You can't stop us now
This where the riders at
'Till we posted up somewhere beneath the ground

[Verse 1]
BME, trust the truth's in the booth
He don't take a hit to let 'em know I'm bulletproof
Rest in peace Proof, this is no truce
This is hood music brought directly to you
Mac-11 in the Chevy with a nigga or two
Ready for whatever, we cuckoo, loose screw
Used to bungalows juicing up fiends
Just to ride 'round in the new school
Come from basehead rentals, same faces, no dental
Claiming they gon' pay incidentals
Give a fiend a break, he see God all in ya
Then he run game 'till your change all minimal
Pinning them predicaments to live that life
I been spending Benjamins since the early '90s
Now BME is where a nigga can find me
Still on the grind nigga still getting mine

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Niggas, I done been around the world and back
Ask about Trice, ain't shit fucking with that
BME said "Get 'em", Obie did exact
Straight from the trap to the mo'fucking map
Young nigga, star, do this, car
Louis, where a nigga murder a track
Hurdle over snares and claps
So verbal, had to dumb it down so your ears adapt
Now it's Money in the Bank, Lil' Scrap's pappy
'Preme in the tank, ain't a vehic' could pass me
Ask BME how a nigga from Craft be
Nasty, K covered up in the back seat
Any melee coming at me - death day
Pastor be speaking to your fam-lay
G shit, I'mma rap 'till my sun set
'cept sun's up, BME what?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Nigga I don't slip, handle 'em, rap's Rip Hamilton
All in his mansion, gambling
Alls I'm trying to do is match 'em, rapping
Get a couple chicks, I'm rambling, stab 'em
Take 'em to the crib where it's magnum, madness
Mashing, ass, as if, you ain't know the half
It's BME, that's the mo'fucking staff
Now I represent on they behalf - yes

[Hook][Intro 1]
I'd like to thank you all for purchasing the new Obie Trice album
It's well appreciated
I'd like to thank you all for copping my classic Cheers
The Seconds Round's On Me, it's well appreciated, no doubt
Detroit city stand up

[Verse 1]
They say when a nigga for testing
They say that he stay kept with his Smith & Wesson
Story tells us his accomplishment's a blessing
Now that's what the fuck I call an urban legend
When a verse kept him from serving corrections
Turf he slept in had notorious conditions
All of symptoms that ought to send me to prison
Yet he had a vision
And since then, I've witnessed those visions
An eye witness to put sense into it, you ain't listening
Get it? I hate to keep twisting 'em
My mind ventures, I spit with conviction
Nothing fabricated or based of forcism
Simply kicking what's living in O Trice's system, come on

[Intro 2]
I wanna thank Shady records for backing me up for all those years
Nigga, Eminem, Paul Rosenberg, Riggs Morales, (?)
I wanna thank all my label mates, D12, 50 Cent, G-Unit
Stat Quo, Bobby Creek' and Cashis, it's been one hell of a run

[Verse 2]
Album number truces, found him in a booth nostalging
With Dre pounding the beat machine
O Trice say nothing, deleting them
'Scope couldn't destroy my evening
We are the elite, machine
Niggas is ass backwards, thinking they in the class, as if
And have access to these type of masses
When I seen this, massive
From a black teen with dreams of being this rapper
What happened is that he slipped between the cracks
Brought to your ears all the years that I've captured
Re-appeared after Cheers, the classic
Second Round's On Me showed you O mastered it
Cause Obie not an actor in this shit
Actually, it's action show you know different
I'm ah be a victim on the set that I lived in
'til I die, it's Obie Tri'
Try to understand this psychological span
From serving them grams to inserving them fans
That's right, Obie hurting them, man[Obie Trice - talking]
A lot of motherfuckers man
Lou Green, Shyne Stringer, Keith Stringer
Lawon, Goo Serve, Little Randy
That's what I'm doin this for (EW YEAH!)

Yeah, we ain't here to mourn
We here to celebrate
So this one is for all my dogs that didn't make it in the struggle man
(EW YEAH!)

[Verse 1]
I's remember when I was on the Ave. clutchin them dimes
Gut touchin my spine, bustin my rhymes
Feelin like I'm livin in them lost times
No sight of the future, damn right I shoot ya (ew yeah)
Palm tight on the Rooster
Old in the face, cause this hold on my case
Got my growth at a fast pace
Old folks like "O, oh he's a bad case"
He won't last, his track record'll do the math
Crack solicitation on the Avenue is not new to your listeners
But this is true, listen up
I gotta spew it and keep it all truth or else
I might as well give this up, feel me now
From rocks to pow pows, Glocks to pow-der
I done did it all, so I clutch my balls
And notice they still here, so Obie is still here
So Kobe here's to you and daddy's new career

[Hook] - w/ ad libs
So grab your cups of beer
Put 'em up let's cheer
Here's a toast to all my soldiers who ain't here
This is it my niggas this what we boast about
Get your bottles homie, pour some out (ew yeah)

Now grab your cups of gin
Put 'em up let's win
Here's a toast to never lookin back again
This is it my niggas this what we boast about
Get your bottles homie, pour some out (ew yeah)

[Verse 2]
Now I understand every man got a story to tell
But fuck it, I got a story as well
Growin up where us niggas either buried or jail
Popped by "Dirty Harry" or popped by the cops for they yayo, locked in a cell
Who's to blame when I was raised in this hood, where my crew was slain
Only a few remains, y'all talk about stuggle
With your bubblegum lifestyle (*scratching*) nigga fuck you
I'm here today for fam passed away
Bodies deep six nigga, flesh decay
Real cats who had techs to spray
Babies to raise, miss them cradles went straight to the grave
The hood life is in me
So I sip the Remy, while my pockets scream "give me"
Lend me your ear, I'm guaranteein y'all feelin me
Straight from the block to the industry (C'MON)

[Hook]

[Obie Trice - talking]
Yeah, all my homies that's deceased rest in peace
My nigga KF Ski, Little Green
P-Funk you'll be home in a minute nigga, haha, we get it poppin
We got a chance to speak to the world nigga, haha, and I ain't stoppin
Straight off the craft .. 313

(EW YEAH!)[Hook](x2)
They say I'm crazy, and I don't give a fuck
Goose in the cup, 40 by the nuts
Crazy (lay a nigga down like what)
Cause they don't know nothing 'bout me

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
Trice is the truth, puncture your roof
If what I enunciate ain't getting through you
Listen nigga, School Craft raised me
Hey bay-bay, you don't wanna fucking play with me
I got the K covered up in the back
Got the pistol on my side nigga, O stay strapped
Stacks in the jeans, this is a natural thing
I don't act out a movie, I'm actually the scene
I pull up on the scene, nigga holla back
With a bad bitch Italian and black
They don't take double takes, they take Kodaks
Coast through the club relaxed, where the V.I.P. at
Coast under the cub, post underneath the duds
Supposed to, I'm a motherfucking thug
But they say he crazy cause he don't give a fuck
First nigga play me, light his ass up

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
[Obie Trice]
Yeah I'm crazy, the hood made me
So O abide by the code on the daily
Niggas get it twisted, bitches get it twisted
Cause I live like unrealistically
Ay, my nigga Breed in the booth with me
Motor City 'til them pall-bearers dig me
Underneath the soil
Ain't no future in your fronting, nigga I'm Detroit loyal

[MC Breed]
Oh so what you know karate? I know crazy
Hit you with something, leave your left side lazy
Coming for the whole shebang, yup, believe that
Take it like I want it, get behind ya like I need that
'Til I get more "Wassup's" than Martin
Get drunk, come through, bust up the party
Tonight, very night, Breed and Obie Trice
You say our ass crazy, yeah you motherfucking right

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Obie Trice]
Say I need Ritalin, cause when the choppers start riddling
Bodies start dropping, disappearing
Tempers start flaring, nigga nutting up
Ain't no coming back from that bruh
Ay, bad days some faggot in a bag
Give a fuck what neighborhood you at
What Dilla dick you sucking, when the pistols bucking
Lord knows someone family's suffering
And I ain't the nigga that'll start the beef
I lay back, I ain't got a problem with G
But lick her and niggas like twelve hits of E
Suicidal, somebody on their way to meet Jesus
These demons keep chasing me
Get away from me, or the AK speaks
No wonder why they see him as a freak
Say he crazy, in the motherfucking street

[Hook][Intro]
"Crrrry"
Dry ya face nigga (dry ya face nigga)
Get it together (get it togheter)
I ain't goin nowhere (nowhere)
O. Trice (O. Trice)

[Verse 1]
Niggas wanna kill me, 'til a nigga done
Wanna peel my cap back, see a nigga gon'
All because I rap actual facts on a song
It's no fabrication, what's wrong (what's wrong)
Slung crack to the day come (day come)
But they don't wanna gimme that, say he fakin (fakin)
Schoolcraft is the makin (makin)
But God forsake 'em, they hate I'm great
Conservin them weight, to the Top 8 at 8
You whether see him wait, momma hypervenalate
Tuckin her son underneath the state (Michigan)
Hip-Hop's my fate, since cassette tapes
I've been braced what you know of, as this niggas culture
Put it in a chokehold, spoke as a soldier (soldier)
Yea he provoke him, to pull up out his holster
Leave you wit a visible ulcer, O gon' off ya
Niggas ought to when he lyrically offers
All cause he salty, I'm rollin like a boss
I don't follow nigga's course, I'm akward
My choice, Rock City is my voice
The White Boy stepped down, so I will accept the crown
Exceptional however, never let ya down
Found my new niche, no more bricks
So I'm pitchin 16's, verbally bitch

[Hook]
"Crrrrrry now" Cry now
"Crrrrrry now" Cry now
"Crrrrrry now" Cry now
"Crrrrrry now" Nigga cry now

[Verse 2]
Cry all you wanna, numero uno stunna
Then snuck up on ya, Lord what has become of us
The Boy hold the "D" down, like none other
Up comin since slums, can't knock them mothafuckas
So we, take shots at 'em, try to snuff 'em
Rather see 'em suffer, then become one up on us
Round the globe, promotin us hustlas
The white boy's cool, but refuse they brothers
So we, cock the tools, and shoot our own color
This ain't Detroit Red, you won't +X+ me out +Malcolm+
My Exodus will never be from a violent outcome
I turn Exorcist on niggas wit extra clips
Exit on my ethics, is no longer present
X-rays show, I was this close to Heaven
So for future reference, I stay this close to a weapon {*click-clack*}
Who you testin, never said I was the best, never stressed it
Don't make me get in my zone, I will own that whole note (fa sho')
Metaphorically, for where I roam on chrome yo (fa sho')
Detroit for niggas that's slow, it's the O
I was birth wit Jehovah's hand on my soul

[Hook]
"Crrrrrry now" Cry now
"Crrrrrry now" Cry now
"Crrrrrry now" Cry now
"Crrrrrry now" Nigga cry now

[Verse 3]
Can't explain the gift; but my aim is to take
What the streets gave my brain and spit
And I ain't evaporate, I will remain the shit
So ya lames that got a problem wit the game - tough tit
He still in the same Range, windows fixed
And I'm killin ya come a-gain, that's as real as it gets
Off ya, tryna make me depart ya, from my daugh-ter
Coffin's for you, and the nigga that brought ya
The hatin start in ya, release from our father
You people at the alter, saying ya better off
You don't wanna see the demon, come out of a humen being
Recent being the sience, and to him it's too extreme
Catch me in the BM, like 2Pac and them
Or in that Tahoe like Christopher - NO
Poppa gon' keep poppin Cris on you hoes
And piss on those, who exist as my foes
O rolls through shit, spittin cold flows
Knows his business, I'll be missed if I go
Who you know holdin the city on his shoulders
Flow is ferocious, it's O shit, true vocalist - BITCH!

[Hook]
"Crrrrrry now" Cry now
"Crrrrrry now" Cry now
"Crrrrrry now" Cry now
"Crrrrrry now" Nigga cry now

[Outro]
"Crrrrrry now" {*to fade*}[Intro: Obie Trice]
[Tony Yayo] Shady, Shady, Shady
OOOOOOOOOOOOO-MIIIIIIIIIX ("Cryyyy")
Back nigga (dry ya face nigga)
"Second Round's on Me" (get it together)
Kuniva, Ca$his (I ain't goin nowhere)
Stat Quo, Bobby Creekwater (O. Trice) WHAT!

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
Niggas didn't kill me, now a nigga's gone
Can't, peel my cap back, I'm never at home
I'm somewhere, with my shaft restin on a ho's tongue
Sippin Dom Perignon while she sippin up them newborns
Yeah, bet ya hate the news holmes
He probably somewhere, sippin on a stoop, huh?
Sippin on a brew, plottin to pop me later huh?
When will a hater learn I'm too great on a song
I push weight on the corner, send weight to the coroner
When courage make him turn performer
I transform into Uma Therman, a dude's version
Verses lettin a 'perfluous nigga with no purpose
Continue to walk this earth's surface
I was birthed in hip-hop, watch out my services
Yet, you tried to murder this nigga that's comin
From the same turf as you's, nigga, what nerve of you's nigga
Pissed cause your hustles ain't worth a shit, nigga
I'm gettin rich, I'm on my way to Hugh Hefner's, dig?
With a bitch you in the trenches tryin to reach it big
On another rapper's dick who don't represent where you live
Know you're annoyed but don't make the mistake
I'm state to state in that Honda nigga, not an Accord
I'm in that Honda G4 you would never afford
And yep, it's probably E's but a nigga is on board

[Chorus]
Cryyyyy now, (cry now)
Cryyyyy now, (cry now)
Cryyyyy now, (cry now)
Cryyyyy now, (nigga cry now)

[Verse 2: Kuniva]
I'll be damned if I let a nigga lay his hands on me
I'll lay his ass out and park a Grand Am on him
The city where the weak survive and the strong die
Where beef collide, shootouts happen and hit the wrong guy
I done seen the worst of the worst - and what can be worse
Than a verse about bullets dispersed up in your shirt
The streets is like a curse, niggas frontin for a bitch
It's like you beggin to die like bear huntin with a switch
A part of my heart is gone, I can never smile the same
Trigger finger is itchy, it'll take a while to tame
Detroit is hella Dirty but the Dozen can fix it
Resist and a biscuit will excede the distance
And bounce off one's home, hit and ricochet
Off a kid's trombone right to where you niggas lay
Obie can tell you that death is just a few inches away
I shed tears but you can get your fill of it today

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Bobby Creekwater]
Yo, Obie, they gonna fuck with us this time nigga (B-G-O-V)
Uh, Bobby Creek, nigga
Laugh now, cry never, my Beretta is a body part
Hit 'em with just enough shots to make his body art
Now I feel like we even
See Creek is here to shine a light on you niggas this evenin
Soon as I get my call I'm right on them zeros I'm leavin
Load up a clip and make it dark on them heroes I'm cheesin
Shit they got snitches on the clock, gotta watch what I sayin
Me buy a bitch a couple rocks in a watch? Quit playin
Back on my grizzy my nizzy, nobody ran with me
And for them fuckin spectators I brought the band with me
Halftime niggas, and grab pine you would never grab mine nigga
The doc was lyin when he said you gon' be fine nigga

[Verse 4: Ca$his]
Witness the art of war, in the physical
Since raw coke was rushed through my umbilical
And no words from Ca$h mouth is fiction
Ready to throw clips if, I'm never dissing you
My aura awards raw to the core and the surface
Of the street, when I walk through the door, my purpose
Is to move up, pull towards you purp'in
Watch me overthrow the government for my interpret
Plot of Bin Laden, soul of Mumia
I'm prayin to Proof, I'm Searching for Jerry Garcia
Talk to my brother, gone in the streets of the D
I'm totin the K, at hawk niggas waitin on me
You take the first shot then, Second Round's on Me
And when you walk, on the other side of me, and my brother ride
I don't rap for the plaques
My contract's signed just for scratch to get you wacked
Nigga, with a gun, with a shank, with a bat
Take a slug through the lung, get it right, what you wack nigga
I'm born crazed, deranged and more famous
Than clapping down bangers meant, for entertainment, yeah

[Chorus]

[Verse 5: Stat Quo]
Young Stat keep the gat on tuck
Want war, I don't give a fuck
Shot 'til you kiss, pucker up
It'll lift him up, believe me you'll float
The result is your family heartbroke
Lookin like an artichoke vegetable, hold stiff
Nigga paralyzed from the neck down, my goons stick niggas
Turn soldiers to stick figures, hand on triggers
Real life, born killers, we roll out like four-wheelers
God shill us, from back-stabbers and goldiggers
Tipsy off brown liquor, watch me
Obnoxious, broads call me cocky
Poppy long dick Stat beat up the box like hockey
Especially when a bitch ride dick like jockeys
From the Benz, to the Range, to the black jalopy
I'm the shit, the only one who ain't heard is Foxy
Formalize the plan, no man can stop me
Boss hog, Stat Quo understand, you copy?
You copy?

[Chorus]

[Outro]
[Tony Yayo] Shady, Shady!
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Alchemist
[Eminem] It's The Re-Up[Hook]
Dear Lord, please forgive me, more I live I grow empty
Nothin' in me, point out my enemy I'll put somethin' in him
*Blam* Feelin' like that's the only remedy
Send him on his way when I fuck around his day
("Okay!") Cause to you they wanna send me
And I ain't got the energy, I'll let the clip empty
("Okay! O-o-o-okay-k-kay! Kay-k-kay, kay-kay!")

[Verse 1]
I ain't gotta walk around town with my chest stuck out
A frown up my face when the press come out
Niggas know what it is, one of the best, no doubt
Doubt that, test him and the S's come about
Aggression niggas need without
Too aggressive niggas rest under leaves where the G's hang out
I'm back stronger than ever
D-boy so it's like whatever, however, whenever
I dare ya, pall bearers bury ya
Pardon my, positivity failure
But they ain't tryin to hear ya when niggas'll go and air ya ass out
Send you to the morgue, turn you inside-out
Send you to your momma 'til she pass out
Too many partners in the casket now
These foul bastards, don't appreciate life so fuck 'em
The P-nina-nina stay dumpin' (Stay dumpin')

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Now Trice ain't all about runnin' his mouth
He do that for a livin', y'all gotta feel him
In the streets he mute, my nigga autism
Don't confuse this with art-ism
Nigga I refuse to lose, boss in him
Put your people in a pew when the mossberg start spittin'
I'm livin', nigga I'm kiddin' him
Take him from his paradise, Trice on his way to prison
Picture him leavin' his children
I peel 'em, pilgrimage to another region
Them ecstasy pills got niggas schemers
When the weapons spill them same niggas bleedin'
'Fore I leave this world they gon' believe him
O ain't deceivin' these people, that's feedin' 'em
The hood's what he breathin, it's all good
Leave him in that box all wood (Box all wood)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Trice is nice with aim, put a nigga
In a permanent frame, when a nigga's
So determined to bang, cause a nigga's
Switchin' lanes in that European thang
Don't be mad at your boy-boy, handle business
Cause he push the toy-toy, niggas envious
Crutch him up, Jehovah Witnesses
When the semi's start spittin', listen (Listen)

[Hook]

[Outro]
*Blam*
("Okay!")
("Okay! O-o-o-okay-k-kay! Kay-k-kay, kay-kay!")

Dear Lord, please forgive me, more I live I grow empty
Nothin' in me, point out my enemy I'll put somethin' in him *Blam*[Intro]
Yeah!
So beautiful man, you should come visit
Detroit Summer
Quit hatin' man, yeah I know its not L.A., its not Atlanta
I mean we comin' up tho, Summatime ya know

[Hook][Intro: Rob Reef]
Obie Trice, let's talk about Obie, uh, what he meant to the label
You know. Detroit born and bred and uh
You know, had sold you know
A couple million albums and really was like the, uh, you know
A really important component of the label

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
"Detroit vs. Everybody", my version
Still keep the clocks workin', thot's twerkin'
Still hold the notch under my Louis Vuitton
I'm certain, I'm still ill, I'm still about mine
Still young sick on his prime
Still call me Pat , way before his crime
Still go to bat for my fellas, call me the young Cabrera
Niggas better crown me three times
Nigga sold crack in this bitch, my nicks like three dimes
Fiends so high, should have charged them three times
Still in the cutty with my lil buddy
He say fuck his medication, he still nutty
And crown hangin', 1911
20th century if you ever mention me, this means history
BME that's the D, that's Obie Trice, that's who I be

[Hook: Obie Trice]
You don't want the walking dead, put you in a coffin yeah
It happens quite often here
Bullets will appear, penetrate your appearance
On your death bed while the doc yellin' clear
You ain't livin' guts over fear
Nigga you nuts, you wanna ruin your career?
In God we trust, no apology, be an autopsy
Niggas don't follow me Detroit vs. Everybody

[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
Feeling like Kal-El versus Zod and his entourage
With the armor like [?]
And modification have you on a vacation
Ever invasive over me and my squad
You know the city limits got the illest image
You ought to know a nigga before you come and visit
It's vicious
Them individuals don't give a shit
Cause they been living in this bitch with only government assistance
Flipping prescriptions, injestin' as well
My suggestion to you, is to adjust to hell
It's just like that, hard justice fails
And you just another cat with a slug in his shell
I represent the D till my peeps mournin'
Till I'm 1300, East Warren
You don't feel me, then believe warning
Might not leave performin', who shot 'cha?

[Hook]

[Outro: Eminem]
...There was something about Obie's delivery, it was his voice, it was so strong, it was like, you know, it would fucking cut you. He didn't fuck around, he meant business...

[Verse 3: Obie Trice]
Yeah, woulda died for the narrator, you know me, I ride on the hater, suicide every collab with a player
Send drive-bys through you lair, later, 1.0, the boy rare
Shady since a nigga 15, spray ya'
Wanna race in the D? What city fucking with we?
Rest in peace to the fucking mayor, P![Verse 1: Eminem]
They ask me am I okay, they ask me if I'm happy
Are they asking me that because of the shit that's been thrown at me
Or am I just a little snappy and they genuinely care?
Doody, most of my life it's just been me and you there
And I continuously stare at pictures of you
I never got to say I love you as much as I wanted to but I do
Yeah I say it now and you can't hear me, what the fuck good does
That do me now, but somehow I know you're near me in presence
Oh, I went and dropped some presents off for Easter to them
Two little beautiful boys of yours to try to ease their minds a little
And dog you'll never believe this
But Sharonda actually talks to me now, Jesus
And everyone else is just tryna pick up the pieces
Man how could you touch so many fucking lives and just leave us
They say grievance has a way of affecting everyone different
If it's true how the fuck am I supposed to get over you, difficult as it sounds

[Hook: Obie Trice]
Doody, I dropped a tear in a rhyme
The day you find it is the day I stop missing DeShaun
Holten, it was written, it was woven for a soldier to leave so suddenly
Got me wide open
How could God take a soul so dope and
Turn around leave us all heartbroken?
Know that you're saying keep going, be a man, no emotion
It's your duty, till we meet again, Doody

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Doody, that's what we'd call each other, I don't know where it came from
But it just stuck with us, we was always brothers
Never thought about each other's skin colors
'Til one day we was walking up the block in the summer
It was like 90 degrees I was catching a sunburn
Tryna walk under the trees just to give me some comfort
I'm moaning I just wanna get home when I look over and your shirt is off
I'm like you gonna fry and you're like, "No I won't, I'm black stupid
Black people they got melatonin
In their skin we donâ€™t burn," meanwhile my face is glowing and I felt
Like I'm on fire and the entire time you're just laughing at me
And snapping at me with your shirt, bastard
And I still have to get you back for that shit
And by the way them Playboy rings, my mother stole from you
Well Nate finally got 'em back shit
It musta been at least 16 years ago, well I put 'em in your cask-oww
Moving past it, it still ain't registered yet
But you can bet your legacy they'll never forget
The Motor City, Motown, hip hop vet, Hip Hop Shop, dreads
It don't stop there, yeah, as difficult as it sounds

[Hook: Obie Trice]

[Verse 3: Eminem]
And this might sound a little strange but I'mma tell it
I found that jacket that you left at my wedding and I picked it up to smell it
I wrapped it up in plastic until I put it in glass
And hang up in the hallway so I can always look at it
And as for all me and D12 we feel like fuck rap
It feels like our general just fucking died in our lap
We shut off all our pagers, all our cell numbers is changed
Our two-ways are in the trash so some cats will have to find a new way
And I know it feels like the dreams will die with you today
But the truth is they're all still here and you ain't
Purple Gang, you gotta keep pressing on
Don't ever give up the dream dog, I got love for you all
And Doody, it's true you bought people together who never
Woulda been in the same room if it wasn't for you
You were the peacemaker Doody, I know sometimes you were moody
But you hated confrontation and truly hated the feuding
But you were down for yours whenever it came to scrapping
If it had to happen, it had to happen, believe me
I know you're the one who taught me to throw them bows back on Dresden
From making cars to paintballing and getting arrested
To sitting across from each other in cells laughing and jesting
They tried to hit us for five years for that, no question
I guess them hookers and bums that we shot up
Didn't show up for court so we got off on a technicality, left sweatin'
Me, you and what's his face, I forgot his fucking name
Shame he even came to your funeral, he betrayed our team
And if I see him again I'mma punch him in the fucking face
And that's on Hallie Jade, Whitney Lane and Alaina's name
I let the pistol bang once just to lick a shot in the air
For you and pour some liquor out for you with Obie in the parking lot
Of 54 just before we were supposed to get in cars
To come and see you, once more difficult as it sounds

[Obie Trice]
Doody![Bizarre]
(*Coughing*)
Maybe it's the weed..
It's more than the fucking weed

[Hook: Dion]
Doctor doctor, come put the breaks on me
You better send me home
Cause I ain't leaving till something leave with me
Right now that's all I'm on

[Bizarre]
I've had a headache for the last three days
And the last couple days I been missing some pay
Do I have AIDS? I'm sniffing and coughing
And really this doesn't happen to often
Maybe I'm tripping, maybe I got the flu
Maybe I'm stressed out, something I'm going through
It's been a week and me and wife ain't have sex
I'm usually a wild guy, I'll break her fucking neck
I'm sick and I'm starting to wimper
It's ninety degrees, it's like December
My temperature is hundred and six
I can't shit and I feel like shit

[Hook 2x: Dion]
Doctor doctor, come put the breaks on me
You better send me home
Cause I ain't leaving till something leave with me
Right now that's all I'm on

[Bizarre]
More trouble, here comes day two (Two)
I took a shit in my white underroos
My eyes look like I been smoking crack (Uh-huh)
Exlax got me throwing up Big Macs
Nyquil, Advil, Tylenol, synus
Carrying my (?) around like I'm Linus
Maybe it's the pork I ate in New York
Or maybe my baby mama wanting child support (You bitch!)
Or maybe it's the fish that made me sick
Or maybe it's the prostitute I let suck my dick
Or maybe it's just the bottle of vodka
I don't care, I just need to see the doctor

[Hook 2x: Dion]
Doctor doctor, come put the breaks on me
You better send me home
Cause I ain't leaving till somethin' leave with me
Right now that's all I'm on

[Obie Trice]
I'mma kill this bitch, the tip on my dick
Ain't got an itch but I couldn't resist the switch
She's the type of bitch made to flinch
Walk passed niggas, all in the ass
Or it's because I had a tall glass
I dropped my drawers without my dick wrapped
Purhaps, I could catch the crabs
But, at that moment that's irrelevant
I knew what I know now, I practice celibace
And be hesitant from tappin' Evelyn
Heaven sent a message when I came back negative
"Never fuck a bitch in the ass off a laxative"

[Hook 2x: Dion]
Doctor doctor, come put the breaks on me
You better send me home
Cause I ain't leavin' till somethin' leave with me
Right now that's all I'm on

[Bizarre]
Yeah, just visiting Cincinnati
Me and my (?)
I'm with my boy, Hi-Tek, down the street
Yeah, can you take, do you take debit cards? (No, we don't sir)
Food stamps? (No, please, sir, get off the line)
? go get Hi-Tek out the car, man
Tell that nigga I need some, money for the prescription
..Kweli! Ha-ha![Eminem]
Hailie, what do you want to be when you grow up baby

[Hailie]
I don't know
But I don't want to grow up to be like Ja Rule's little dirty-ass kids

[Eminem and Hailie]
Ah ha, yeah, c'mon
G-G-G-G-G-G-G Unit
Hailie, come here baby, bring Daddy his Oscar
We're gonna shove it up Ja Rule's ass

[Swift]
I'm about to get rid of some hoes, it's simple
I'm quick to murder ink with lead and I ain't talkin' bout a pencil
Look at what the fuck you done got into
I see you found your niche, you just a bitch with a menstrual
Claimin' you a murderer and you spelled it wrong
You put E before the D cause that's all you on
You on Pac's dick, you a replica guy
If he was still alive you would never get by
All you do is cry, bitch keep it real
Life is more than imitatin' niggas and eatin' pills
And what kind of motherfucker ruins three deals
That another nigga got you, they didn't see skills
And I ain't playin', you a brother gettin' cheated
And Ja Rule be prayin' on his cover cause he need it
And all you niggas hatin', shut you mouths
It's just that real niggas ain't buyin' that shit y'all put out

[Obie Trice]
Doe, rae, me but we don't sing motherfuckas
So Murder Inc do your thing motherfuckers
You unleashed on a team who expects nothin' less
Than R&B comin' from that regime
Regime is a little extreme
Neck and neck with soldiers, motherfuckin' Marines
Ja sold his soul to sing
Weave eye-witness team on the TV screen, chase the greed
Now that you've embraced the green
Don't fuck with the triple beams
You's a motherfuckin' actor, slash Pac impersonatin' rapper
Slash Billie Holiday, how it happen
Artist and repertoire saw him in action
Pac assassination, Def Jam grabbed him
Told him reenact him, you go platinum
They seen it for sure, I know that Afeni Shakur
Don't enjoy Jeffrey Atkins reenactin' her boy
So I'm click-clackin' this toy
Mash and destroy, Shady slash Aftermath and Detroit, mothafucker

[Hook: Eminem]
Doe rae me, fa-so-la-ti-da
Don't blame me cause you washed up lost your spot
Mama-say-mama-sa-ma-macosa
Ja quit playin', knock it off, you're not 2Pac
Don't hate me, I'm too hot and you're not
Shooting at me, with the only shot you got
Ja quit playin' knock it off you're not 2Pac
You'll get popped poppin' all that shit you pop

[Kuniva]
Now we can get past the mean mugs and get to the slugs
To the grievance and the crying and the intimate hugs
We don't take you serious nigga, you shook you half of a half-way crook
Get off X dick, go sing a hook nigga
And you can't replace the late great one
And when you gone you only gon' be the late fake one
Nigga please, stick to the script
Before the guns stick to the clip
And Benzino you ain't shit but a bitch
Fuckin' old-ass ignorant innocent lookin' senior citizen
Built up, slap you like Grimace, all sensitive
Wait a minute, hold on
Is it me or do he look like a banana with braids and clothes on
A bitch-made man
Now how you gonna connect with them short ass arms like a Tyrannosaurus Rex
You niggas can scream holler and curse
Go ahead and respond and pull that pen and pad up outta your purse

[Proof]
Slim didn't send Proof to get at the wankstas
He told me to let loose and spit at the gangstas
What up Gotti, and this little war you pushed on
Put your ear to the ground for stepping on bush stones
What's wrong, didn't think we strong with real niggas
Roll like a boss in the streets they still feel us
It's real business y'all ain't caught the concept
You talkin' nonsense to walking bomb threats
Contact was blown by Benzetta in The Source
Threaten at the boss you gon' see me on your porch
Now Irv got the nerve to try to serve on us
But Detroit niggas early and ain't scurred to bust

[Kon Artis]
Word to my nigga Bugz, punks like you get beat up
Stomped unconscious and smacked with the heater
This rap cookie monster gets jabbed in the tonsils
With dicks so much that he should be fixed with a vagina
Who's behind you
Cadillac Pac or that transvestite
That dress like a Lil Kim fox
You're just like a little windbox
Press tight on the trigger of this Glock
Swallow that little shit you got left to help you eat
You knock Pac's songs without love to help you sleep
You got shot in your video trying mock Pac
You Mockaveli, get your own identity

[Hook (Refrain in background)]
Don't you never say my little girl's name in a song again
Fuckin' punk-pussy bitch
I'll fuck you up boy
Never
Don't you never in your motherfuckin' life
I'll choke the shit out of you little motherfuckin' midget
Hailie'll whip your motherfuckin' ass

[Outro- Obie Trice]
That's right motherfuckers
Shady records, whatchu know about it
Fuck Benzino, fuck Ja Rule
Nigga, this Obie Trice right here talkin' to you motherfuckers
Ja Rule punk ass, yeah
Fuckin' Soul 4 Real ass
Nigga, that's Soul 4 Real
That the nigga from Soul 4 Real
Candy Rain-ass nigga
He got a deal now he rappin'
You don't know what's, faggot-ass motherfuckers
Get money to all my real niggas, man
Obie Trice, D-12, G Unit, 50 Cent

[Hailie]
Daddy, is Ja Rule taller than me?

[Eminem]
No honey, you guys are the same size
