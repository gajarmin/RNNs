[Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
See let a nigga come through with that bullshit
Any time you pop that shit nigga
I'ma tell you you can suck a dick, you can suck a pussy
I know, it'll come to what? Say what?
Now I'ma let all you motherfuckers know
See them knows that this is something you can't fuck
Whether you from Brooklyn, whether you from Manhattan
You from Queens nigga
I don't give a fuck, where you be motherfucker!
Where you reside... motherfucker!
How you live? How you seeeeeeee

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Sort the stack outs, this one's the blackout
Three-fifty-seven to your mouth, blaaow!!

[Buddha Monk - Brooklyn Zu]
Dunn can you hear me? Raw is how I'm inflicting this
It's that G type slang that makes this real sickening
Ignite the styles, I got my hand upon the trigger
Starts from the smallest and hits the bigger nigga

[Prodigal Sunn - Sunz of Man]
Yo, straight out the live by them hell fires
A known mental killer, born thriller, assassin of terror
A hot bloody fatal mixture of carbonate water
Homicidal manslaughter, death is the order
Start the mission, travel like the speed of wind
Through the valley of sin, I step to ville and murdered many man
Serving justice in my vicinity

[Zu Keeper - Brooklyn Zu]
(This is, Brooklyn, Zu!!)
Za-za-za, za-za-za
Zuh-za-zah, z-zz-zz-z-z-zz-zz-z-dah-duh-dnn-duh

[Murdoc - Brooklyn Zu]
I get down, I get down, I crack your fucking crown
Lay around and watch some real niggas break ground
I can't shop cause every bro blowing up the spot
Hit rocks and niggas know

[Killah Priest - Sunz of Man]
Yo! Niggas grab the mic like the bites of a scorpion
Nervous, that's why the Zu brought me in
Now bring em forth, like the tortures at the courts
Before the case begin, first break me in
His brain! And make sure he can't maintain the calmness
Ya harmless, watch how I bomb this
Stage like mail appears to be the Moon
Now your Posse is your fucking Platoon
Stale sound just flows through the air
I'm like a ninja, once I send ya downstairs
Then I get furious, imperious, the lyricist with the clearest rhyme
Erupt to deduct your fucking mind

[12 O'Clock - Brooklyn Zu]
Fuck shit up on the hurry-up
Known for burying ducks through more styles than a monk
Warning you chump, brain is out for lunch
Given the power punch, soon to be paid like Donald Trump
Never fall victim to no bitch
Jerked my dick, but still got more hoes than a pimp
And score more points than Shawn Kemp
Keeping powerfully strong like the center on the Knicks

Hut one, hut two, hut three, hut!!
Ol Dirty Bastard live and uncut

(Shame on a nigga who tried to run game on a...)

[Shorty Shit Stain - Brooklyn Zu]
Got more props than the President
My hardcore represent, blowing niggas back who never had this
Cause I'm gifted, so you can gift wrap the shit
I'm kicking and send it to your moms for Christmas
And tell her Shorty Shit Stain sent it
Soon to have more green than the Jolly Green Giant
Cause niggas rap styles just down, it's expired
You should of stayed home instead of picking up a microphone
But if you wanna run on up, like you tough
I call your bluff and blow you down with my hardcore stuff
I shine like twenty-four carat

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Roll and stroll with the party scene
Nigga wanna know me as Mr. Clean
Wza-wza-wza-wza-Wu-Tang, flip the script and
Test my skill niggas, you're tripping
Drugged up from sniffing, you're the one who's riffing
I'm not Opie, save that old shit for Andy Griffith
Start to flip, slip cause you're slipping
While you sleep I be the God on point, with Scottie Pippen
As I jump on stage, flip rip a show
Strip and rip a ho, wayyy like Bo
Jackson while I'm still taxing maxing
Relaxing sitting back, silly attraction
Again and again when I rock the jam
Wanna see em up in the air, throw up your hand
Introducing one-man band in town
It's wild, more the style couldn't stand nigga
When the jump stepped to the center
Of the rhyme inventor, MCs come at the
You get dap slapped, across the MC map
Your ass that's your ass on a whore shot
Come on through I black and blue your whole crew
Then I get Rudy with the Hong Kong Foo
Ol Dirty Bastard, MC killer
Money maker, Brooklyn, Shaolin style
That I lay down like tile, then I get higher

[60 Second Assassin - Sunz of Man]
Here comes the illlll, type ruffer
Style be untouched I'm leavin broken down grammars on the pen
Who who what? What brings it? Tighter than your anus
Chambers this name is for the deepest trainers
Keep it stainless, steel, on time it is the windmill
Deadly venom kills, at the last of the Sam's Mill
60 Second, nucleus, attack on your set
Hit you with the blast (yo close the door)
Shabazz!!
*gun blast*[Intro: 9th Prince]
Attention, Soldiers! Kill every one of them!
Ha ha! Another [yeah] fucking live-ass track from the Temple of
[Shaolin monks] Shaolin! [yeah] What, nigga? Word up. Yeah! Keep it
Real. Killah Priest, you know what I'm saying? [yeah] The Prodigal
Sunn, [rah] Sunz of Man. Madman [yeah] representing for the Killarmy
The Killa Sin, [ha] the RZArector....

[Killa Sin]
I gotta get a grip, an edge on life, I'm living trife, G
I'm shiesty, now I see why nobody likes me
It might be the image project that I selected
But 'F' it, shit is mad real as well as hectic
Inspect it, your vest and got tested
Suggestions molesting my thoughts I manifested, but check it
My mind was designed for crime, the bottom line
Cause it's my time to shine with the nickel-plated nine to a spine
And ain't no remorse in my source of madness
With my temper, my anger rises like my status
Because I'm known on the borough of Shaolin for wilding
Don't think that it's peace when I be smiling
A heart stone-cold is what I own, for niggas who brag
I break bones leave 'em ungagged and hear them moan
I hate snakes on that fake shit
I get mad, leave 'em shooken up bad like when the quake hit
I got a steezo that's raw, man
Another brother provoked and gun-smoked, now that's all, damn
Why did he marvel the father of horror
Knowing full well that he won't live to see tomorrow
Be on your guard when I start to flip shit, I'm sick
Word to God, it's hard to get a grip

[9th Prince]
I brings a streaking iron flame, like Hell was steeling Heaven
Clips and shovels deeper than the shallow trenches of the brethren
I burst like lions ____ the slaughter
Then I assume my human facility, I plan a hit to the governor
Open, open, behold the gift, designed to kill many men
I stick 'em for billiard pins
Like caving some world in, flashing death like lightning from the Heavens
Leaving rappers suffering the thirst of a silent curse
That came from the Earth when the planet was reversed
Here are the needles, see that he dies
From the effect of a drug, come bleeding out of his eyes
I chop off his feet, so he can't walk and talk, then he claims to stalk
I shove him with pitchfork and stack up dead corpse
A Soldier of the Darkness, kidnap an MC for a hostage
Then break loose on the stage
Trading places like slaves being trained, I'm under pressure
Thoughts be acting wild like a child molester
Madman terrorism, today's journalism
Going to war across the country with another organism
Killarmy madness is how we kill 'em

[Prodigal Sunn]
Since the calculations of time which held the life that held the day of
Expiration, steady creation
Mental death, the source of the abomination
I emerge from the house upon your territory
This one, alias Sun of Man no longer deceived by Satan's blend
Here's a ministry fighting wars of demonology
Soldiers have got knowledge, rewriting your sins of reality
Lyrical space, the black neophyte, run a satellite
I should jump deep beyond the depths of my inner sight
Visions of me on the night of a solar eclipse
A-boarding the mothership, taking my last whiff from this polluted mess
Another soul's vibration escapes this cold tunnel of fire
Show alliance, using your brain from the lord sire
I tie your fucking brain up with barbed wire
Infused thoughts left ya bruised, him been condemned
To the rims of Hell, afraid to walk
Reaction, slow-motion, in shock from the explosion
Symptoms of death--left ya choking on your own breath
You better study your literature, seek the scriptures
Biblical folds 'n' scrolls, laced in velour robes
Killah Priest precise, the messenger 60 Second
Hell Razah, bless 'em, overcome the oppression

[Killah Priest]
Hearken as the night darkens
You've been warned that the Priest will soon swarm
Now you'll be done away like the unicorn
With night time as my uniform
And death as my sword, the universal warlord
The Sunz of Man came together for one accord
You can't read about it, it's not a myth
Here's a puncture, to your rib, [pshaw] for a gift
And the only present I'm dealin' with is now
The supreme slayer, I wrote the Book of Isaiah
Layin' bodies down by the layer
Burn 'em before the assembly
And watch his ashes go up through the chimney
They have disguised me as brass before his prayers
And though his words be lost in the air
The reason you felt chained is cause I've been ordained
I tie you up and throw you off a fuckin' plane
And fill up your parachute with more dead bodies
Don't ask me why--it's a fuckin' hobby!
Burn 'em with the fuel, put down ya tool, I laugh at you
(Why?) Because MCs are my footstool

[60-Sec. Assassin]
You enter the hocus pocus, perhaps the dopest
Tote this, for those all with dope shit
Focus, I blood-shot your lyrics with cirrhosis
Ferocious sound effects break the "glaucosis"
Insanity enters humanity like an enemy
Invade your central nervous system like an advent
Mathematically schematic, I'mma panic, couldn't hold on to a tablet
Semantic, goes through your system like an addict
Bomb glistenin', watch for the blow, I deliver it
Faster stroll, you wrote, minute, barrier, delinquent
Grabs your soul, magnetic flux be out of control
I'm leavin' peeps serviceable, sell his soul to the toilet bowl
All your possessions I own for my own
The chemical, you clone, "comatosis," the syndrome
The Rip-Van, the Winkle, twinkle twinkle
You caught up with your days now, organism star
What part, whistle heart, intruders travel so far
Not even the master chart would put ya arteries back apart
From Allah, this technique is so odd, odd, odd....Shining Star!

Intro : Ol' Dirty Bastard

Yeah, knah I'm sayin'?
This is what you call making history right here
The Fifth Element
Earth, Wind, Fire, Sunz Of Man knah I'm sayin'?
We got the Wu-Tang Clan in the house, knah I'm sayin'? ODB
Yo Wyclef play the guitar man!
The earth is approximately covered underwater
? street walks for surfers
The sun & moon had attract the power
While it's on it's way around the sun

Verse 1: Ol' Dirty Bastard

I'm the Eddie Kane of the Wu-Tang
Osirus with the fire-extinguisher slang
Maintain this paradise on this earth
With the shut the fuck up style
For what this shit is worth
Watch a nigga catch a purse
Super-hero niggas die
Do my dirt, get away and multiply

Verse 2:

Hey yo entrepeneur wisdom ? who
The dark kahlua, the black sire
Smack fire out of the liar
My heart desire
Speak truth and light this fire
The clever writer, not lia, never retire
The child teacher, mouth speaker, earth seeker, wind blower
To the seas I'm like Noah

Chorus (2x): Earth Wind & Fire

You're my Shining Star, no matter who you are
Shining bright to see, no matter who's with me

Verse 3:

Uh, hey yo this masterpiece be exclusive and fascinating
Street knowledge education
Teach the seeds son no procrascinatin'
Ghetto learnin' graduatin'
Blessed be the ones with patience from the ancient
God bless the child that could hold his own
Little shorties don't trust a soul it's all globe control
Earth Wind & Fire, Sunz Of Man, and Wyclef
We connect like unanex and bring the intelect
We teach both sex, Brooklyn to Tibet, male or female
Who follow footsteps and correct

Verse 4:

I'm a Shining Star, beam of light from out far
Hits like these would burn holes through our resevoir
Espionage, let it be known who take charge
Come hard with the underground like camouflage
Keep it bizarre, mainstream for the young teens
Though if it don't be for clearance till 13

Chorus (2x): Earth Wind & Fire

You're my Shining Star, no matter who you are
Shining bright to see, no matter who's with me

Verse 5:

Escapin' the ghetto
Using the bass tempo or treble
In the streets we carry heavy metal
Roll with the devil
Yo son life is reality, reality is life
People livin' trife, the world filled with strife
The god's livin' right in this act too many lack
Black on black crime
No vest, another nigga laid to rest

Verse 5: 62nd Assassin

It's been a long time
The beat's certain
Sunz of Man behind deens of wall searchin'
The heat is perkin' Earth Wind & Fire burnin'
Sensation yearnin' and learnin' situation
Wyclef platinum hits
Beach nation is what your life could truly be anticipation

Chorus (2x): Earth Wind & Fire

You're my Shining Star, no matter who you are
Shining bright to see, no matter who's with me

Verse 6: Ol' Dirty Bastard

Yo, yo, yo, yo, when I was young I taught how to produce
The science of babies gettin' loose
I turn white boys to Springsteins' Bruce
Blacks to blues
To the Chinese I gave Bruce
I can't help it if my style is foggy
Words to boogie getcha high on my patio
Or come to see me movie
Girls your walking on my dirt
I'm all in ya hair
Or mike your life plane call hurt

Verse 6:

To all my shining stars
From here to L.A. to Mars
Growin' up in the ghetto where times is hard
No matter who ya are
You a child or God
Born as a king not a slave for jobs
It's much more to life then to drink at bars
Large bank accounts and these fancy cars
Little King Tut's scheemin' when they lust
They get handcuffed for diamiond ring cuts

Chorus (repeat till end): Earth Wind & Fire

You're my Shining Star, no matter who you are
Shining bright to see, no matter who's with me[Hook: sample] (x3)
I walked away and I left you cold

[Intro: Hell Razah]
This goes out
This what y'all niggas all been waiting for
A litte story for all my brothers
You know what I'm saying? Sunz of Man return
We gon' walk on by and keep it moving
Just when it got cold
Cold Sunz we got jewels, we gon' walk on by and keep it moving
Check it. Moving. Word up

[Hell Razah]
My thoughts be colorless, the undercover rich
Haters loving it, watch the Hell King Tut' with it
Queens bathtubbing it, my diamond's cutting it
Sharp and on point, fuck the tricks of the government
Money rules the world, got my people suffering
Cops busting in, handcuffing men 'til they wrist bleed
Some read what they don't need, give to seed
The Black, Lebanese, rabbis in green fatigues
Microphone masked MCs, Maccabees
Hard head MCs get told and still they freeze
The truth came in flesh but still you don't believe
The best thing you know is the spots to find weed
Get the knowledge dungarees, we still struggling
Sunz of Man, UK keep it bubbling
We come to clubs, like the ones who bring the trouble in
What? He sold his soul, life publishing

[Hook] (x2)

[Break: Hell Razah]
Have to walk on by and keep it moving

[Verse 2: Prodigal Sunn]
I reminisce on my dark days whenever I phase and kept a blaze
Y'all mental slave renegades, wasn't enough to eliminate
In my lifestyle of hard times and good times
Stood mine with the wines, became nice with the mind
Born intelligent, fuck elegant, I represent
For the ladies and gents, delinquents and peasants
Everyday hungry, gun play on the Sunny
Crews sweeter than honey, stars fuck for all they money
Stupid dummies, fifteen slugs flood the tummy
Thugs rapped like mummies, sipping Remy
The clip empty, feeling shifty, swifty
Highly intoxicated, simply infatuated
Never thought he could be faded
Up in the hospital, critical, eating pickles with no teeth
Back on the streets he got beef for little Keith and Tariff
A walking death wish, living selfish, I sort of felt this
The fifth of September, he found them helpless and breathless

[Hook]

[Hell Razah]
A daylight shoot out, a dice game, bank loot out
Jewels out, laying on three hundred dollar sweaters
Tools out, last day schools out, nine Berettas and better
Carry the Avirex leather
Timberland weather gear, hands in the air
This is a stick up, don't play for hiccups
You won't need a body pick-up, money in the laundry bag
Hungry comrades get they guns from Arabs
With the loot that they had, they rob more victims on the av
Today cash, examples of the program
Lord Sun of Man, stop killing your own relatives
Unknown start giving the liquid to the dry bones
We all came from the same throne
Raise the dead with the brain poem, this one is aimed home

[Hook] (x.3.5)[Intro: movie sample]
We are all obligated to pay off the debt
The national debt to these international banksters
That's - that's the bottom line
The bottom line is money
International banksters, gangsters
Yes, the banksters, banksters, banksters...

[Intro: Hell Razah]
60 Second Assas', (black banksta'z) S.O.M. original (black banksta'z)

Aiyo Knight, we bout to pop it off (John the Baptist, aiyo, we all)

[Hell Razah]
Banksta, polish my shoes, tiltin' my hat
Rockin' my jewels, knowledge my booze, kissin' my gat
Aiyo, P, we need that walk child money
We be hungry, death to these niggas who take from me
I rep for the ghetto and cities, states and countries
White t-shirts and blue dungaries, smokin' on a ton of weed
Landin' on land that's overseas
In them S.U.V.'s and we polly for more g's
Who that sphinx in a mint jump suit, don't make me fling you
My two wizards, casino sisters, I'll have 'em drain you
It's painful to live in our shoes, hit you with jewels
All my banksta'z, get in the groove, rubbin' your ooze
Cop anchors like Italians and Jews, we bring it to you like
Prophecy news, for all ya'll Kay Slays, Flexes and Clues

[Chorus: 60 Second Assassin (Hell Razah)]
Banksta'z (black billionaires ownin' companies)
Banksta'z (you ever see some Malcolm X currency?)
We straight bankstaz (project fakers, hallway casinos)
Banksta'z (we roll like Shaft, die like Pacino)

[60 Second Assassin]
I'm a banksta, I watch 'em go 'head, I keep money, and hop on these
So money never meant a thing to me, yo watch me go on, I got dough, shoppin' spree
I'm a banksta, I keep money, so fresh from the heels
Money never meant a thing to me, Killa Bee killed, Bedstuy
I'm a banksta, I keep money, with somethin' real for your grill
Money never meant a thing to me, packin' steel, fuck around
I got it growin' on trees, and it's this heat you will feel
I'm a banksta, half of you six, just take it back in the booth
Never you knew, not even more or less, half of my crew
Takin' your loot, beat you to you're black and turn blue
Watch us, Black Satin, we the banksta'z, bring it on through (Black banksta'z)
Fuck who you knew, son in your booth, my nizzle what the fuck you gon' do

60 Second, I'mma bash your whole crew

[Chorus: 60 Second Assassin (Hell Razah)]
Banksta'z (acres and mortages on houses)
We straight banksta'z (we add and multiply cash by the thousands)

[Prodigal Sunzini]
We bank up with money bags and bring trucks made my Jaguar
S.O.M., where money's is deep dish, we eat fish
P-Sun, banksta one, where is my guns
Measure my temple, treasure my mental, ya'll niggas limble
Now got your dentals, through your dimpels, it's all so simple then
Bank, off that green brocco', chocolate expresso
Twist a wetto, 36 strong, in Puerto Rico, fly tolitos
Die for my people, ride for my people

[Chorus: 60 Second Assassin]
Banksta'z (get that street money)
Banksta'z (that weed money)
We straight banksta'z (and street money)
Straight banksta'z (get that freak money)

[RZA]
Yo, my street officials, is bust through this municipal
Building, and snatch back the entrance off my principal
Banksta'z, my bank account is strictly digital
High royalty visiduals, my staff be made invisible
Banksta'z, fuckin' the President daughter
Resident out in Florida, platinum plaques on the corridor
We those banksta'z, that shit rhyme was gangsta
You may catch me down on Lakerson, pushin' the eighteen inch anchor
One hundred pennyweight boy, the black mini tank
Just caught a quarter mill' in cash, up from Citibank

[Chorus: 60 Second Assassin]
Banksta'z (get that street money)
Banksta'z (that weed money)

[12 O'Clock]
Banksta'z, gettin' that dough, shootin' that fo'
At them jealous muthafuckas tryin' stop our flow
We them banksta'z, 2 On The Road, two on the globe (street money)
Doin' shows in Alaska where it's twenty below
Be them banksta'z, (that weed money), Benz truck, hummers in the snow
Wit them twenty inch rims, lookin' fifty four
Double barrel shotgun, fuck sawin' it off
Blow a nigga head off, if he sneeze or cough
Whose the boss, 12 O'Clock, nigga, Sunz, of course
Carry a fifty g check in my Wu-Tang shorts
We them banksta'z

[Chorus: 60 Second Assassin]

(Weed money, that street money)[Intro: Killah Priest]
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, uh-uh, uh, S.O.M., baby
It's that time, for the shorties
Yeah, yeah, power to the music
Word up, 2000, one time

[Killah Priest]
Shorty wanna be a thug, only 14, sellin drugs
Wind up in the court pleadin to the judge
Or outside on the pavement, bleedin cuz
He got hit by a bullet, now he need blood
In the ambulance didn't have a chance to weed a slug
Type of shit that even it does, put a spell on us
Puff an L on the corner, or in cuffs in jail wit the lawyers
But in this hell, I'm a warrior, struggler, straight hustler
Do you feel me?

[60 Second Assassin]
Bluck, bluck, bluck, this to all you lamesters
Reppin now and respect to my gangsta
Watch ya move son, wettin ya crates
Wit the triple drum base in ya face, takin ya case
60 Sec. rats in ya face, it's all foreplayin, don't
Get it wet in this place
'Sassins like, fella ain't lease this train
Don't make me have to leak this place, I'd rather lead the way
Drop about a seed a day, got sunshine on a bleedin day
Kill about 3 or 4 beats a day, rush plus brush, ready for play
Catalog shit, day for day, bust a murder murder rate away

[Chorus: 60 Second Assassin (Hell Razah)]
+Must B Tha Music+ (Why we run the streets wild)
+Must B Tha Music+ (Make us pull our guns out)
+Must B Tha Music+ (I can bust in her mouth)
+Must B Tha Music+ (Got us all thugged out)

[Hell Razah]
Dice games by the coke spot, niggas love shit he don't got
He get chased off is own block, on parole for that white gold
A young man wit a old soul, in his project +Hell Hole+
We don't care about no clothes, you can die by that pay phone
You're best bet is to stay home, young chicks wanna get boned
A little dick make 'em get grown, even the rich get a tombstone
We all die in the flesh, son, bleed blood and through wet guns
Get money and respect comes, got respect and connect comes
Get rich, next death comes, ya don't wanna come test and son
We stay strapped by the left lungs, we don't care where you rep from
Sniff this 'til you get numb, hold ya head cuz we ain't done

[Prodigal Sunn]
Run the streets, thugs hold heat in they feet
Soul you reap, hot slugs eat through meat
Roll wit four deep, two in the crease, soak neat
Trophy, smoke and eat, soul physique
Code of the block, is that gold bars a prop
Sold base, rock steamers for them caps and top
Hip Hop, drip from the lip of the Glock
Grick shop, all day long we burn rock
Industry rap, chemistry empty the gat
Sun of Man yo, never to run, we slum cats
Yeah word up, you know how we do

[Chorus]

[Outro: 60 Second Assassin]
+Must B Tha Music+

That's turning you on
+Must B Tha Music+, +Must B Tha Music+

Yeah, Joe Uzi, Makeba Mooncycle

[Prodigal Sunn (Hell Razah)]
You might catch me outta Cali' swervin'
(Doin' my thang)
Lames out to ruin the game
(I'm doin' my thang)
See me in the hood, Blackwood
Twistin' a Range and every nigga from the ghetto
(Probably doin' the same)
Keep my metal on the side when
(I'm doin' my thang)
Focus my aim, stack CREAM
(Doin' my thang)
Six-foot-two, ladies love the way that charm swing
Out in Palm Springs, stoned off that crippy
Sticky green, video shoots
Them candies in them penthouse booth
Catch me blowin' shorty out in the confession booth
Money market plans, keep a nigga stressin' for loot
I stay high, fly, dressed in them custom-made suits
Big business, live for my fruit
Build for my fam, here's another one
Sunz Of Man platinum jam

[Hell Razah (Makeba Mooncycle)]

Aiyo, I saw many come and go that wanna be me
I show love to fans, this ain't TV
Hoes wanna come in the bed, drink and feed me
I can't help it, it's real, I live kingly
To stand where I be at now it ain't easy
I grew up where the Bricks and fiends be
Wanna paper hate, but we gon' eat
Kill a party up in South Beach
Smokin' on a pound from Greece
Do the knowledge, everyone I'm around is deep
Sunn-zi, me and Makeba givin' you heat
Yours truly, Heavenly Razah
Keepin' it street, even if a nigga hate
(Keep doin' ya thang)
In the club with my bottle out
(Buildin' with queens)
You might see me at the Superbowl
(Kickin' some game)
You might see me comin' out of the store
(Just keep doin' ya thang)
Buying champagne and Pampers
(Doin' ya thang)
Up at Pakmart shopping
(Doin' ya thang)
Coppin' weed out the weed stash
(Still doin' my thang)

[Makeba Mooncycle]
I'm at the head of my helm
Reigning my realm, holdin' my weight
I'm bustin', I'm bustin' right through the gate
Mooncycle stashin' ammo and rifles
I will fight you, beat, bite you, out-write you
Spark my crew to ignite you
Masquerades, I protect with rocks and grenades
This is everyday as we plot and we pray
Known as warriors, we come out to play
To bless the ignorant, we got rhymes for days
'Cos I don't wanna hurt nobody
Out on the street or up in the party
I know my directives, this is S.O.M
That's an acronym for the Sunz Of Man[Intro: Hell Razah]
Sunz of... Sunz of... Sunz of Man
Sunz of... Sunz of... Sunz of Man
It comes down in the last days to makin Bloody Choices
Word up, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yea
Killah Priest

[Hook: Hell Razah]
What you gonna do with God inside you?
Where you goin to when Hell's around you?
Heaven is the place, we on our route to
Destroy you right now, we about to
The sin is to the devil that divides you
Knowledge of self will civilize you
Civilize you and you and you

[Hell Razah]
Yo, yo, yo

[Hook (lines 1-4 only)]

[Hell Razah]
Yo, in this universal tournament, I warnin it
If my knowledge, you not absorbin it
After I thought of it, my brain recorded it
Then I track slaughtered it, went on tour with it
Longer than life or death, stalkin it (stalkin it)
As I inject this in your ear drums, here comes tons of intelligence
Fatter than elephants, I lock a mental slave instead of level my Dead Presidents
Why should I kill fool who tried to kill me?
Walk thru this industry with a bond to my chest for victory
History heals me, shields me, force fields me
With the truth, goin out like a troop
At war and able with my gun ready to shoot
Righteous bullets keep the minds wicked-proof
Any day you be a target aimed off my roof
What? What? What?

[Hook]

[Prodigal Sunn]
Yo, yo, in these revolutions, they never end
Do mental and physical calystetics
Sharpen my tactics, live Allah's Mathematics
Movin in the sun's shadow, devistation, agrivation
Stalks my nation, death of temptation, Saten's allegations
The fire in us will charge for the wicked to burn
Only concerned, levitate, elevate the black germ
Thru the process effect your domes with my vocal tones
Those who is stoned, elevatin gases thru the microphones
Roll with the stroll, rebelious, to weak knowledge
I seek the sheeps, will only bring forth the Killah Priest
Fatter geristics, automatic, clear as plastic
Tragic, drastic, killin all psychopathics
On my journey from the house of steel
Where Gods reveal the silk, devils distill and kneal
Witness the blood spill

[Hell Razah]
Life tell lies, death in our face
Every other day we killin off our own race
Rather drugs, guns, somethin common known
This is the place that we all call home
Life tell lies, death in our face
Every other day we killin off our own race
Rather drugs, guns, somethin common known
This is the place that we all call home

[Killah Priest]
I use my pencil like a ginsu, utensil, chops into the mental
Of the simple, brain with game that's natural
Like actual brains of rice
I leave stains on mic, from darkness I spark then
Bring back the light
Niggas is sweet like a Mr. Goodbar
I leave ya ass strung out like a fuckin guitar
So bring them hither, with the, could you run
You niggas try to slither when I be the Sun
Lord of ya fuckin barricade, stompin ya ass with a
Land thru deep and narrow  caves
So act up and have ya found laces shook
Ya rhyme took, boy I give you thirsty looks
Like a bear who just been robbed of his cubs is a slaughter
I gone thru the water and the mud
The way I slay it, is rather unique
Instead of using tech 9's, I'd rather use a technique
With direct speed, I make ya sufficant
I send ya upper lake, scarred, scuffed out and scraped

Mic's Of Insanity
Dododododododododo

[60 Second Assassin]
Create my flow
60 Sec
Now let's move the intro duct
Guard ya shit
My maze get under ya skin, beneath ya surface with aim
Hurt his, black, livel actin
The act, the opposite of a fact is a fake
In depth, waitin on is arixec, disease
I tie knots in niggas legs and make knees
John James Brown said "Please, please, take my hand"
Yours flow, your style has now been burried in burns land
With the Arch Angel, Seventh the Land
And a voice from the temple ordered to form the ground
Sand, the Hell, twight pore the bells upon rivers
Problems rebel, now let us reglow, upon the waters
Into they become blood
So is blood under the sun?
You better go speak to the nun
Before he become priest thru the assassin's elite
Bringin agony and agony to niggas feet
Who swivel what war? Learn to speak
While I get in the circus for hundred and 43 thousand peeps
Like I said my flow goes beyond and under the deep
There's no peace without war
So shall I beat the meat, you obsalete, bringin destruction to his peep
Rollin is the deep in the night, my trife is the
Killah Priest
A Prodigal Sunn who sits in the northwest corner of the right
By dawns early light
You who cover the slummin of the 360 degrees sight
The allegic, who done takin rap beyond the testaments
With this advancemiss
I dial up anyone who second changin this
Style be ransom in this

Mic's Of Insanity

[Prodigal Sunn]
From many centuries and decades
My nations softer then bagion mistreated
Defeated, over powered by the conjegation
Now I face life thru mental death
Havin black outs, visions of the Earth before my day of birth
But even them from the crew spirt, who had no aura and no understandin
How the world turn
Many cause to fall victim to reality
They shall die in inequity, they loss for eternity
Throw the boat on that bullshit
Makin a parody, cuz I see thru grinches, shatter ya fuckin teeth
Bag and spittin up with ammo, as I get scratcho
Separate Jamal the Chemistry in the Seven Jails
I got the mind of a murderer, bison, held captive
Torn to seven years, buy the addistence
I fear on, to the wicked, but his time is limited
Cut the Angel low and surround down to the innocent
On the face, baggin off forgiveness
The penalty is 11 plagues of diseases and illnesses
I steal vultures on the otto walls, million peace
34 thousands techniques, to devour the beast
Devastated by the ebonimation, give it ridest
But who here wanna get held captivity, shall be diminished

Mic's Of Insanity

[Hell Razah]
You know have the right to remain silent
Cuz all violent nights are deadly nights
Dead murderers stretch the death rate to express stress and hate
Mental activity, the style of potential that's a left
To infinity, and could it be
Will take a team, full of schemin demon
Cuz I transport and stalk inside and murder ya daughter
While ya brain is caught dreamin about it
Big heads, with little brains get damaged
I'm a menace stranded, to my reality is finished
No order without no rights
You can be ordered behind the walls of hell
Or jail, it don't discriminate
Similar to the ones that wanna iminitate raps

Mic's Of Insanity[Intro: Hell Razah]
Grand
Know what I'm sayin
Even though I don't see you, Know what I'm sayin
My niggas in jail, knowhatimsayin?
I still got my eyes on you, word up
Knowhatimsayin? another chapter

[Hell Razah]
Yo, you couldn't see me with a telescope
Worse than cancer smoke; your antidote
Give me the remote, turn them off
I'll let my album melt your ass to a cross, crucifixion
Camouflaged for the mission, use your third eye
To see the Israelite, detect those who tell lies
I see you magnified, I blend with the sunrise
Burn your enterprise, today husbands and wives
Become Bonnie and Clyde, carry .45s in these last days
In times, same shit inside or outside
Tales of the dark side, we still among minds
Keep the strong in the jail cells, the countdown for hell
Use the truth or you bail, let my words be the brail
For the blind who can't see us, like Black Jesus
Caesars, try to seize us, we spot them like cheaters
And turn them into believers

[Beretta 9]
Yo, I was born to survive, a soldier and I strive
With a duty to civilize these 85's
In their streets is a wiseman, an original black man
With a plan to run these devil's off my motherfuckin land
Unless you were close, when I strained the operation
Yo, check the first to tool, when I guide to guard your nation
For this military attack, surrender L's; draw back
Beretta take the point on this Sunz Of Man war track
I burn them like trick-alls, while weak brothers went AWOL
This new born god, and I'mma hold my life so hard
These fool keep their intentions, I destroy your intentions
For instance, we talkin this shit with no resistence

[Chorus x4: Prodigal Sunn]
The gods stay camouflaged

[Prodigal Sunn]
Yo, remember, I think it was September or November
A cold winter, I heard you got bagged and murdered
Informed by my nigga Glock, the observer
He told me, all about the fucked up
Remember for a minute, shouldn't understand
Then again, I understood good
Shit is rough in the hood
Before I knew, I was a Sun Of Man
Kept a gun in hand, stalking the land
Back and forth to the island
If it wasn't for the knowledge of self
I wouldn't have been seen dead
Ashes in the base sittin on the shelf
As the years went, became intelligent to the nonsense
Than instead of livin like a sandwich, I can vanish

[Chorus x4]

[Outro: Prodigal Sunn]
All my people locked down for possessions
Word up, my nigga Islord knocked up in Harlemtin
I see you when you come home
From Crowns Hights, to Red Hook
Bedstuy, Brownsville, Fort Green
Word up to whole Brooklyn
Keep ya head up, one to yourself
My nigga Michael, Big Bo from Red Hook
We comin to get you
Knockin down walls, comin to get you[Hook: sample] (x3)
I walked away and I left you cold

[Intro: Hell Razah]
This goes out
This what y'all niggas all been waiting for
A litte story for all my brothers
You know what I'm saying? Sunz of Man return
We gon' walk on by and keep it moving
Just when it got cold
Cold Sunz we got jewels, we gon' walk on by and keep it moving
Check it. Moving. Word up

[Hell Razah]
My thoughts be colorless, the undercover rich
Haters loving it, watch the Hell King Tut' with it
Queens bathtubbing it, my diamond's cutting it
Sharp and on point, fuck the tricks of the government
Money rules the world, got my people suffering
Cops busting in, handcuffing men 'til they wrist bleed
Some read what they don't need, give to seed
The Black, Lebanese, rabbis in green fatigues
Microphone masked MCs, Maccabees
Hard head MCs get told and still they freeze
The truth came in flesh but still you don't believe
The best thing you know is the spots to find weed
Get the knowledge dungarees, we still struggling
Sunz of Man, UK keep it bubbling
We come to clubs, like the ones who bring the trouble in
What? He sold his soul, life publishing

[Hook] (x2)

[Break: Hell Razah]
Have to walk on by and keep it moving

[Verse 2: Prodigal Sunn]
I reminisce on my dark days whenever I phase and kept a blaze
Y'all mental slave renegades, wasn't enough to eliminate
In my lifestyle of hard times and good times
Stood mine with the wines, became nice with the mind
Born intelligent, fuck elegant, I represent
For the ladies and gents, delinquents and peasants
Everyday hungry, gun play on the Sunny
Crews sweeter than honey, stars fuck for all they money
Stupid dummies, fifteen slugs flood the tummy
Thugs rapped like mummies, sipping Remy
The clip empty, feeling shifty, swifty
Highly intoxicated, simply infatuated
Never thought he could be faded
Up in the hospital, critical, eating pickles with no teeth
Back on the streets he got beef for little Keith and Tariff
A walking death wish, living selfish, I sort of felt this
The fifth of September, he found them helpless and breathless

[Hook]

[Hell Razah]
A daylight shoot out, a dice game, bank loot out
Jewels out, laying on three hundred dollar sweaters
Tools out, last day schools out, nine Berettas and better
Carry the Avirex leather
Timberland weather gear, hands in the air
This is a stick up, don't play for hiccups
You won't need a body pick-up, money in the laundry bag
Hungry comrades get they guns from Arabs
With the loot that they had, they rob more victims on the av
Today cash, examples of the program
Lord Sun of Man, stop killing your own relatives
Unknown start giving the liquid to the dry bones
We all came from the same throne
Raise the dead with the brain poem, this one is aimed home

[Hook] (x.3.5)[Johnny Blaze]
So what we smoke cancer sticks and weed and all that good shit
Fuck the world, word up
Sunz of Man, Method Man, True Mast', collabora-tion

[Chorus: Method Man]
Can't you see my love even though we be with thugs
Brothers want grub gotta take it in blood
Because is you down or are you down just because
Can't you see my love even though we be with thugs

[True Master]
Yo, when you least expect is when we attack, in fact
Your format, is not yet suitable for combat
Still dissident factions within the Kingdom
Campaign desperate attempts to take your freedoms
Emphatically, wack strategy, don't impress me
Impulsiveness'll only bring you tragedy, test me
Descent to the essence quickly, niggas strictly flip
Fuckin with this royal assembly, the Sunz of Man
Summon me, Chief Administrator of the Law
True Master in this hardcore Art of War
I explore the depths on conflict and with no pretense
Found the best strategy the most impressive defense
So when you rush to attack, it be I to crush your force
And exhaust your whole supply
Don't send for reinforcements, give orders for men to maintain
They respective borders, or it's a God damn slaughter

[Method Man]
Shots in the park, it be on after dark
Hungry like the Wolf when the beef starts to cook
When push come to shove, we push through the club
Pocket full of bud, baby armed with the snub
Nosed I suppose, you get body-snatched when you doze
Recognize your friends from your foes
Or here lie, another one victimized
Left for The Fly, now what size is this?
Nigga your size, and I would be much obliged
To get a fatter piece of that pie
Still got my Eyes on the Prize, and like Gloria
I will survive, at war with the warrior
Hot with the rhyme, pennies
Turn the heat up, and bend me
Prepare for the next milleni'
I can't sleep, I'm in the shit knee deep
In a race against time, beat your motherfuckin beat
Hold your satellite Son, I'm from where you from
Same shit different slum, where we about to go
Ain't no need for the gun, I treat you to a slice
When we done, and all minds are one, yo

[Chorus]

[Hell Razah]
I be the Rabbi watched by snake eyes as the playa hate rise
New York state side to the West side
Fuck the best rhyme, best respect mine, from here
To Palestine watch Sunz of Man climb
I could tell a fake from a handshake for man's sake
The hidden truth, I translate til the land quake
I plan my escape on the good fan base
Strictly satisfaction like the Sunz of Man tape
No copy or biting off of what your man make
It's 1998, get your own mind state
In 1999 write your own platinum rhymes
Can you see my love even though we be with thugs?
Yo, words and keyboards we please the Lord
Lyrics feed the poor, while the rich receive the sword
Couldn't stay in one spot too long, split in fours
Told the truth before tours, four artists four doors
I rock the concert til my arm hurt, doing God's work
While you Star Search, I take your mind to Mars' dirt
Uhh, what..
I said, can you see my love even though we be with thugs?

[Prodigal Sunn]
This mathematical rhythmatical mechanism enhances my wisdom
Prodigal Sunn the lover Islam keeps me calm
From doing you harm, when I attack, it's Vietnam
Through CD-ROM, the mega bomb severs the ice in your charm
Too late for Salaam, slugs rip through your arm
Double leg, arm, supreme head some fled from the bloodshed
Painting many in red, leavin Iranians dead
Chief in me in head , hangin fast on they deathbed
Out the window, lyrics flow like hot chemicals
Burning competitors, from they ears to they asshole
You wanna battle, I separate your Adam's Apple
Crack your skully with a Snapple bottle, on the Apollo
Can you read black, ease back, we bleed tracks
Breeze through facts, contacts smack your wolfpack

[Chorus]

[Method Man]
Hold your satellite Son, I'm from where you from
Same shit different slum, where we about to go
Ain't no need for the gun, I treat you to a slice
When we done, and all minds are one, men from the Sun[Intro: Shabazz the Disciple]
Yeah, yeah, Sunz of Man, Disciples
Got the four Elements
About to take you through the four stages of nature
The combinations of danger
It's like that
Killah Priest

[Killah Priest]
I'm deep into the page
Each stage is like a maze, it's like sperm reachin the egg
I focus on the brain cause it be the enterprise
It's like life within the center of the eyes
Descend off the soundwaves, that are bound for days
The atom is surrounded with rays
My frame be the mercury, it circles degrees
Developed the strength in Hercules
Wisdom changes my continent
When I quiz them I build up the confidence
You burnin me is like tryin to kosher a pig
I teach knowledge and culture the kids
I inject the rhyme into the depths of the mind
The proper insight gives effects on the blind
See I don't entertain, I enter the brain
The Killah Priest always come and represent the name
A daily study stimulates the thought
Correct diet, I meditate with less talk
Makes me deep as the ocean floor
The ink soaks in and I'm prepared to explore
MC's fall like the city of Rome
I'm inspiring like Solomon and witty in the dome

Yeah, writing rhymes with a liquid pen
Next to appear... be the holy wizard

[Shabazz the Disciple]
Knowledge I obtain is mystic, realistic
There's hittin gems in sins if you missed in
Thou have to contain the power to unravel
It's like walkin a-stray on the edge of the earth without a map to travel
Once false step, you enter the depths of darkness
The triple stains that engraved to the conscious
As I drag your mind off the edge of sanity
I leave you floatin, you have to figure your way back to gravity
Taken beyond the orbits of NASA, at rates much faster
Your chest tightens up like asthma
And you be gaspin for oxygen
Inhalin fatal gas, light-headed from the hydrogen
Driftin in the wind like a cloud that can't rain
You lack the element so it's relevent to strain
Your brain lacks water like the moon
Dependin on the earth since you first left the womb
Words engraved to paralyze you in the mental
Too much weight to analyse the potential
Amounts of pressure that'll tilt your scale
And as for 85's I describe it in braille
The blind language, the deaf and dumb I use sign language
Cause I was blessed to exorcise stress and anguish
Niggas be strainin with they sick sound-es
I'm splitin atoms and spillin holy water on their conscious
Travellin 186,000 miles per second
Then shine forth as far thoughts if you can catch em

[Hell Razah]
Life is hell, hell tells lies in your face
Every other day we're killin off our own race
When you trapped inside hate
It's hard to escape inside a slave mindstate
Cause you go out like a blind date
Surrounded by danger when you're livin in the world full of anger
The pain I drop just to get you got is a brain strainer
Deadly talk, silent thoughts
I can't overstand when the man wanna live long
And you think too short and distorted
Payin for your religion when you really can't afford it
I'd rather live like the god then instead of dyin for a devil
You couldn't climb this level with a ladder made of knowledge
I demolish, abolish, so don't try to follow
I look into your body in the dark and I could tell you that you're hollow
You're sleepwalkin, blind ass zombie
I hell raze from the grave of ignorance (yo)
Just to finish men lookin guilty of sin

[Prodical]
Cryin deep within the mental, my soul is intoxicated
Opressed with stress, aggrevation, pain and frustration
I can't take it no more as I journey through the halls of hell
Justice prevail, unrighteous will surely fail
Now may my enemies be defeated in the Chamber
Of danger facin life full of strife, filled with anger
Forced to enter as an avenger of sin
I roar like the mighty lion as I contrive of Benjamin
Experimentin with all types of fuckin gases
I got the potion to turn your flesh to fuckin acid
Atoms Shatter, and lemons start to scatter
Illusion dwellin in path for mental confusion[Intro: Reverend J.M. Gates]
My brethren and sisters and friends
I like the idea of being a soldier in the army of the Lord
(continues preaching)

[Intro: 60 Second Assassin]
Arch Rivals
We got the Kingston young ones over there running scared
They ain't seem to have a problem and its a bad one
Ahh man, Sunz of Man teaching everywhere
Got the children over here, teaching them the problems
And its the real one
Ahh man now we got the {?} over there
The Sunz of Man solving problems, yo this the right one

[Verse 1: 60 Second Assassin]
Guess this is the end, whatever how never, depart clever
But not deadered to be real or to be severed
A double-header, the black mecca respecta
Catchin wreck from whatever soul, clever, from chives to cheddars
For the first setter who loves it wetter
Well I can make it better
In a bloodbath you letta
Black soggin, treaty, the ledger
Government minted, chedder, promisary and lettered
New order, enough to register kill or be killed measurers
Take you beyond the heist, forever so
Doin out Little Italy to Mexico
Now who be the next to go
Will it be Sam, will it be Fran, or will it be Cisco
Or strictly back to disco
However though one and my own one, soo
Never pet yo, full deck pro
The most sensitive intensity the world could ever expect, yo
Between two steels
To keep it real I remember we used to pick cotton out of fields
Got it real got it down, yo

[Verse 2: Killah Priest]
As I break your fucking bones into pieces
And make ya death the sweetest
Punch a hole through ya cleavage, by the way how was Jesus
I hope you been baptized
Fucked up and meet ya maker, with two black eyes
And broken legs, a broken hip and an IV attached to your arm
I remain calm, for the storm
As I shake my javelin up in ya abdomen
And then I grab ya friend
And break his fucking back, watch him collapse
And my servants clap, a standing ovation from the whole nation
Y'all want more, I crank the chainsaw
Next thing ya knowing, his head start rolling
His body swollen, his fucking tongue is stolen
No more groin or colon, he's just moaning and groaning
Exciting, Clash of the Titans thunder and lighting
Reveal the sword of the Viking, it's frightening
Put down yo fist they'll be no fighting, just sacrificing
Tonight is a good night to take yo life
And leave your carcass in the darkness
Where the jackals prowl upon your grave
Yo hear a howl from the cave
Then I snatch out your arms and give 'em to your moms
Sing along sing along sing along
Strumming my fiery harp, 'til it get dark
Silver darts melt in your heart
Then we begin to march, until we rip this whole fucking world apart

[Verse 4: Hell Razah]
My team be strong, we live right or wrong
Death come calm, sweet wit a charm
As I speak from the throne in my temple
My samurai sword made of metal chop through ya level
Devils in the mist, hate we exist
Clique form my fist, punch you in your shit
Styles murderous, sordid justice
Judge those who bitch, cut those who snitch
Modern Egypt, Pharaoh presidents
Drug measurements got us dead on cement
Robbing for rent, gauge in the trench
Slave ever since, return of the prince
Constantine the great, never go for bait
Sunz of Man plan, gold in every state
From Railhook to Libya deliver ya sword to the bombery
My armoury run the economy, rule is our policy
The deaf dumb knowledge me
Like love peace and honesty
The thugs on the street hustle to eat
Cover you with sheets, we bury you in beats
Fasten my seatbelt my flame is soft melt
We bomb like a stealth and give food for health
Not a friend of me...

[Verse 5: Prodigal Sunn]
Watching enemies stare, hostility floats in the air
If I have to blaze yo I just won't care
We roll in pairs, packing machines, moving supreme
My team gleam, like matches and gasoline
Soldier fanatic, seven slugs punctured the attic
He died a tread, It was passed the asking
In a bad position, you should of stuck to yo fucking religion
I'm worse than prison, send yo bones to the pigeons
The demolitioner with the codes of honor
You want drama? I'll bomb you and your mama...

[Outro: Reverend J.M. Gates]Yo what's up man
Yo just maintainin
Just chillin
Goin through the same shit, that's all
Yo I got, I found this paper, knawhatimsayin?
Talkin about that alluminati stuff, some new world order
Some psychic hotlines or
Let's give her the call see what's up
(numbers dialed)
(ring)

[Chorus: Hell Razah]
Hello, my psychic hotline
Dial 1-900 Free-Ya-Mind, Da Last Future, call us up if ya blind
We don't need a phone to communicate with minds
It's Hell Razah, hello my psychic hotline

YO we got some callers, son
Let's pick up the first caller, the first caller

Hello, my psychic hotline

We got the first caller

[Hell Razah]
Hello pranksters, too many gangsters in hip hop
Without knowledge, it's like a pyramid built that ain't solid
Ya ass will get blown away demolished
You better study more jewels than college, I promise
Who dare double dare to true scare those with peace street consequence
To eat, rather West Coast than Middle East
You be marked by the beast
That decrease that black race that increase
Too much ocean, it get deep
For dreamers that's asleep
Blessed be the meak, I be the strong first to weak
The wolf vs. the sheep, to fight and like cowboys and indians
Cops and criminals, American citizens vs. aliens
I dug up more lies than libariens
Here I be Sha the King of the Israelians
Use your little two ears to hear me in
In the meanwhile, Razah reptiles, get exou, who try to bite us
With their poisonous, Silent Weapons For Quiet Wars
Always be the noisest
Now you got riot squad, surrounded the house of God
Pullin out their shotties, Illuminati agents
Tryin to devine and conquer, ya heavenly body
I study my roots while ya party
And get drunk off of Bacardi
And rentin Ferrari's, a hell safari
North America wilderness, Zoo York where animals stalk
And work for the devil without a pitch fork
Sellin pork of all sort, trying to kill off our righteous thoughts
Now the wicked is fallin, hold on somebody else is calling
Somebody is calling

Chorus

"Yo I got things messin with my mind man"

[Hell Razah]
Psychic Hotline, the next caller, call from the south of the border
Needed information on the new world order
"I got a daughter and a son and gun
Which way should I go, Heaven is too high"
Hell is too low, hello, I come forth in White Rose for Black Justice
The untrusted, they get convicted, I predicted
Ever since I was affected from the house of the wicked
Razah mental dead, swingin my double edge swords takin heads
I'm givin vampires garlic bread
Mattresses for they death bed
I see three sixes inside ya forhead
With the same aim as a infa red
And slaves hang off they last thread
Before the spread of bloodshed
It goes that be spoon fed, treasures of the wicked
Prophet, nothin of the gifted
Im from the city where the streets are gold
The young and the old, all thrones
Made the presses gems and stones
All rise, let me exercise
The adrenaline for the millenium, devils they be kill 'em
I'm healin them
Give them my competitors, face of the Syrians
Draggin opponents through oblivion
Taught by the teacher of experience
You and your seed need to be camouflage like fatigue
Cuz degree and thieves be makin judgements on stolen land
The Children Of Izrael, expand in the village of the damn
I meditate on Mount Fuji inside Japan
Never let ya left know about ya right hand
Understand don't bite it, I write it
With thoughts of psychic, with hotlines

Interlude:
Let me use, let me ask a question
How long uses were on the phone damn
(more arguing)
I got some questions that want to be answers
I wanna know about the ebonics
Ebonics?
I can tell you about the shit
Ebony?
What that ebonics stand for
Devils wanna know
Bout to go outside

Chorus[Dante]
You get mystified, on how history lied
And when the troops came around they had to come in disguise
Unvail some tales of days when the sun failed
And blind with minds thought we all went to Hell
Free energy dwells in deep thoughts like wells
In the age where knowledge is born, clientel
Let it work for you, buy and sell
But make sure it's true cuz I could see your lie in braille
My niggas lie in jail but can't wait to try and kneal
Elevatin the higher stimulation of dyin, brain cells
I'm dead, I can't tell, yo my think-tank is swell
The invisible indivisible bank sales
Through outputs, I smuggle my views without hooks
Educated myself, work for delf without books
Or school, it takes an idiot to educate a fool
We make history while you search for clues
Dirt for tools, genetically alter perfect crews
So they falter and can't offer a damn thing to they culture
Natural blends, God body, actual men
Reclaim the name and make Paegan stations bend in one breath
I take you hymns off of energy through my skin
And I'm blacker than the Indian, attacker in the wind
I depend off the fouls and sins of a thousand men

[Prodigal Sunn]
This is the final chapter of devestation, fatal steps of termination
Set up states, deminishin emcee's behind the ancient gates
The burnin seven arsonists out the Heaven
Severin competition, snitchin the word infliction
Now it's my fiction to tell the truth about the contradiction
Pay attention, understand my main-dead plan of the devil's mission
Causin division, collision through Hell's prison
Before you sin again -- stop, look and listen
Foes that wanna taste the flame, I'm slitin veins
Spittin octane, now you're wounded from the hurricane
Fuckin with G-O-D can be a deadly game
Don't be a fool, fake moves and face and ever-lastin dead pool
I 'scape from the in-forest scene, loaded machine
A beam of stream ignite your elements with gasoline
The radius supreme, AH! Sunn mercinary
Escape the black hole, demolishin, burnin a worth adversary
Penetratin through the myst of the Abyss
The hired vocalist, mental biologist, the alchemist
Devils combust when the enter the God's region
I'm like your skin meltin, it gets the body swellin
Eternal bleedin!

[Chorus 4X: Mood]
Sunz of Man and the Mood, livin life divine
Genuine, ever-lastin light, sunshine

[Main Flo]
Tortured like army heads or centipeeds, we build on our centuries
Solar definity, true signs of our enemies
Life-forms beyond the stratus, and halosatomos
With spaceships, we mic-storm planets
They wanna vanish my under-sea labs, no wonder we laugh
My number-leased staff, my hungerly draft
For decades stored, marks the comin of my sword
My quest is the healin from the lord
Mentally my seed is planed in every mind of the livin
Suprise those who rise, often drifted
I makes a tapes with crystal guides
Like full moons my words are meant to rise
Who the fuck you think sent you the lies?
Before bread I store lead, de-floor Feds
And transport plans throughout foreheads
My ability to warn off the uninvited
Illuminated Sunlight, make moves through planetary eyes
And doom rise through a storm tide
Balloon wise and also roam skies
Of both halfs we cause math through the dome staff
Like army war drafts travelled Ghost's path

[60 Second Assassin]
BLOW! Hold fast with the gas, come and flaaaame at that ass
As thought enters the clip all turentials lift
Set it, I raise yo' asssss like diabetics
Brings the dark to light of hemmoridges, hit the clip
Of the magnetic gift, foooooes with the tongue swift
Sharp as ever, slip, WHAT? WHAT? The juggler
Who's next in line, in chime to suffer?
My rhymes waaaave from under the gutter
Below the grits I smotther, there's too much dirt to cover
Beyond the under, 'vasion, body snatcher
Endin your what? Chapter, chapter
Rapture, niggas catch Falls like Niagara
Buried so deep that when you peak you see Alaska
Savin chatter while climbin Assassin's ladder
I'm wrappin rubish, graze y'all full with buzzards
But reign refutious once two thoughts converge
And when I chop into your dead meat like stew
Like the vultures on the d-low comin at you
Heat is oooooon, word is booooond
Plus this fable's splittin your dome piece like the wings of an eagle
The fore one who keeps it on a roll like a seagul
Makin more moves than Ex-Lax, style is the diamon needle
My people fuckin plus I'm drunken off that cherries
See God beat niggas down, Earth style, you know my steelo

[Chorus 4X][ Hook: Sunz of Man ]
Aiyyo this rap game ain't what it seems
Artists get cream turn fiend
Selling people a dream

[ Hell Razah ]
Aiyyo, you rappers dont amuse me wit your crystals or oozies
Industry groupies, living after movies
They 'Scarfaced' my race, some support hate
Lifes a court date, some die to escape so hold your weight
You niggas brag too much, fuck wit us we bag you up
And use the same clique that you thought would back you up
Its nine eight eliminate bait and open gates
Enough with chains and whips lets make brains eclipse
We all claim we rich, hold thugs in crypts
Forgot about the seeds growing up seven to six
Fuck a Benz wit tints I got the razor prints
Yall rappers love idols there it is Im convinced
Burn my contract, mental combat
And stomp your battle rap wit a Vietnam track
Red and white Sadaam rap sippin Cognac
I bet you didn't loopb know that the real Jews are black
I tell the truth cat where your mind chooses at
The world or the heavens?
God or the reverend?
Your girl or your weapon?
Christ armageddon armageddon ( geddon )

[ Hook ] ( 4x )

[ 60 Second Assassin ]
Here in this life
Big cities a dream on the low is the scheme
A fiend that clock green without jockin somebodys sting
About the plot
You pull the ox who pull the stash outlock
Yo wuddup I, about ready to pull the rabbit out the top
Platinum gold oops upside your knot
Now nigga stop now nigga please
You ain't really ready to roll them sleeves
With your three degrees forty below nothin but recipes
Tight jeans, hype and dont know what nuthin means
Acting like you Billie Jean selling How to be a Fiend
When your loves about black marketing a nigga for his cream
And the big apple it ain't always what it seems
You might get fooled shes a queen
From out of town wagging her swing
All around with she glasses and women asses is what made men jack asses
Everything including your company jacket
And niggas asses for your ransom
And next thing you know they got a nigga dancin
Chancin him out of his advancements
And how yall gonna pay back these back taxes?
This ain't healthy for your assets
Its like your face done been bashed in your career ain't happning
After the monkey wrenches and forks done been stabbed in

[ Masta Killa ]
Intruiging to the ear but bitter to the heart
I begin to take part in The Art of Dart Throwin
Starring the Wu-Tang swordsmen
Raindrops fall the block remains hot
Steam rises from the street which forms the clouds that I move through
Renew my stainless sword style
Allah has spoken the golden code of silence has been broken
Mic terrorist shroom brew wickedness improves
As I ascend and expand extend I seen men
Fall from greats trying to trace the origin
But there is no beginning or end to the lifeline
Sunz of Man forever shine through the mic line

[ Hook ] ( 4x )

[ Prodigal Sunn ]
I say a case of a rap star, permanent scar caught in the rapture
Of the bar code, he was more sold like Old Gold
Paraseuco industy whore bitches adore
Truly yours, feeling me more enemies fall
Ill and hardcore ready for tour shakin breakin jaws
Makin new laws open the doors healing my sores
Blessing the poor, the art of war we less a boar
Verse one we guard a star and the starting artist
Another target on your market style is garbage
You get bombarded whole clique slapped retarded
Pussy harded mcs bleed slugs to the body
Its physical domination lyrical laceration brutal termination
When you fuck wit the federation, collaboratin wit my nation
Discussing allegations conversating about the downfall of Satan
Ghetto frustration keeps my head piece achin
Constant motivation keeps my world in rotation

[ Hook ] ( 8x )

Cars? Women? Huh livin lovely? Phat houses?
What you think its about?
Not gettin paid? Havin fame? Havin everybody lovin you runnin up to you?
What you think its about?
Think its about teaching? Think its about givin up jewelz?
Givin something for the children to look up to?
What you think its about?

This rap game...y'all gotta figure that out...This rap game[Intro: Prodigal Sunn]
Sunz Of Man got rhymes for days, word up
Faggot ass MC's, MC's is fuckin' garbage
Spittin' out garbage rhymes, faggot ass MC's
Word up, slap the shit out of you motherfucker
Tonight, tonight

[Hook x2: Prodigal Sunn]
Tonight is the night that you will lose the fight
I think you'd better think twice
Before you touch that mic
You could lose your life
When you fuck with the right
Tryin' to bite, you get blasted with the pipe

[Prodigal Sunn]
It's one of the members of the round table
The Sunz of Man generate light
The third knight form the Concentration Camp
Burnin like the gas lamp
I came equipped with the gold as my wardrobe
Fully-armored, seven soldiers on the look-out
For Jeffery Dahmer, speakin a ministry
Combine in my terminology, fuck the industry
Cause on the top is where I'm soon to be
The holy scam connect with the Royal Fam
Brooklyn Zu, we ignite the jam
Fuck you and your Uncle Sam
Never gave a damn for the fakin and the phony
Scannin, my understandin, [?] like a cannon
You ask the question, why
Tell me, can you testify
Justify against the high nigga
I maybe do or die
My mind state, magnifies all lies
And for the spy, I keep em searching for the alibi

[Hell Razah]
We goin' gold D, The one and only, sharper than Shinobi
N-Y-O-B, kid your nosey, hittin' on my hoes is for old D's
You know me, gotta roll trees, rolly poley, behold we
Scorin' mass points off your goalie, you try cock blocks, stoppin' slowly
Ain't no way to control me, when I'm comin' for that trophy
From buildin' my diamonds like the carots in jakobe's
The unholy; government reports don't assume me
Aiyo light the trees, pass the fire cuz a lot of force Frank Sinatras
Singin' about street opera's, dead gun to be
Wanna-be Al Pachino's and Danny Devito's
Dressed in tuxedos, gamblin' their lives to gambinos
The blood suck the poor like mosquitoes

[60 Second Assassin]
Streets of fire, two on one man riot
Hired 60 Second 'ssassin, rap retirin thugs
Who was bug, when they new they should of dug
Feenin to be a king, boy , knowin mine, I'm a royal flush
Shit'll drain down today, you couldn't maintain megaplanes
Shit'll totally freeze you ass insane
I be the headman, profession, should've been a blessing
Your next step, only peace that you're resting
Or should I say rest in peace
Dead respectively, knocked off your feet
Without a store, we stole beef
Another example, shitty diaper in my [?]
My Arm and Hammer, I'm cleaning stains at random
Take it best if you clean, 6o Second gee ya
Quotin in five minutes, I'll be five g's richer
You need to put your money up, you're only one up
Fuckin with Sunz of Man, you're gonna get bankrupt

(various talk to fade)[Intro: Killah Priest]
Oh yeah. It's time for us to unite
All tribes, uhhh. Hispanic brothers (Ephraim)
Black brothers (Judah), Mexicano (Issaachar)
Know why?

[Chorus: Killah Priest]
In the ways of the world today
It's so easy us to stray away
Go to keep our mind from all the drugs and crime
Material things keep us blind

[Killah Priest]
I hear the souls of the fallen soldiers
Calling for Jehovah, bitten by the King Cobras
And boa constrictors which convict ya
Nothing but hoes in liquor stores
Cops who handcuff us in the figure four
I try to endure, but when it rains it pours
Amongst the pure and the poor, I'm sure there's war
Bless the child, born naked and wild
Life hectic and foul, I used to watch crowds bow
Until I was exiled from miles, must of landed reptiles
And the gentles, trying not to lose the mental
Abuse a gin for a while, taking straight shots
Hold my brother behind the gates, locked
Beat and backed by the state cops
Stripped of our language, walked around nameless
Amongst the strangest, a heart full of anguish
Taught life is dangerous, devil 'copter aimed at us
Society is to gain our trust, fuck a nine to five
I squeeze the 95-0, watch 'em die slow
Cuz you know that I know

Chorus: Trebag

In the ways of the world today
It's so easy us to stray away
Go to keep our mind from all the drugs and crime
Material things keep us blind

[Trebag]
Stop killing your own, hitting your peeps with sticks and stones
Off the negative roams, is what the babies bring home
Teach 'em self-condonment in the dome, make the brain a stronger bone
Why pull a muscle in this tustle
All your hell is a high kettle, burning cuz I'm black
My realm is shillack, my wooden floor's got a crack
Millonium, laced a strayed with the plutoneum, land mines I'm blowing 'em
Nuclear geranium I aiming at 'em, grenades I'm throwing 'em
Walking through my war field, you yield to my heal
Regurgitate to a lead vile, when your ill
I see the blood spill, aspirin needs the pill

Chorus: Hell Razah

In the ways of the world today
It's so easy us to stray away
Go to keep our mind from all the drugs and crime
Material things keep us blind

[Hell Razah]
This one is for my brothers and sisters, fathers and mothers
Y'all money lovers, killing one another
Some think the life of a millionaire's the way to go
Chasing hoes through tunnels, streets, convertibles
Go out and spend they dough on weed, cars, gold
Expensive clothes, something black owns
They pack chrome, kill where they live at
Still got to go home, catch the jewels from the Macabees
For tracks from my honeycomb ways of the world
Got girls on they needs, shorties showing they privacy
For a bag of weed, before she had a seed
And bit off the greed off the money tree
Can it be this world of simplicity, negativity runs the city
Plus the slaves around me, like lost in king's county
Like lost in king's county

Chorus: Killah Priest

In the ways of the world today
It's so easy us to stray away
Go to keep our mind from all the drugs and crime
Material things keep us blind[Refrain - IAM]

Yo... yo..
I made my name through dedication, Prodigal/Sunz of Man affiliation
Population Click rollin thick, legit, forty burnin spliffs
Initiation, I kill a whole fuckin nation
Demonstration, the year 2000, date of restoration
Burstin inflation, absorbin degrees
MC's, enemies get hung from trees
Brutalities, based on the adversary
I gets amped for my camp in the station
When I release frustration you'll be a fucked up situation
Now do you think, you could honestly fuck with me, G-O-D?
Set up slugs to your jug, I tried to warn you 'bout reality
Ack, saw what I see, too late to plea
Identity, chemistry, rotten in the cemetary
60 Second Assassion, seven days of fastin
Mentally everlastin, righteous with a passion
Competition, I feel they struck you with ammunition
Come at my position, then organize my liberation
You dare cross, defy my intellect? Disrespect my dialect?
Don't need to technical, son I'm nice with my knuckle check
I crusted condition, a mutilation

Dreddy cut the fedi, fake apostles who ain't ready
Yeah we drop science that be heavyweight
We meditate to elevate, we confiscate wicked mindstates
Related to crime rates, you wack? Play the bench
As my lyrics touch the french
Over seas, dumb MC's could meet the Hell Razah's steez
Trees, Killa Bees'll make a nigga feel the breeze
Shake the fire in an ice hand, I am what I am a Sun of Man
Understand, Brooklyn's my home as I grab hold
Of a microphone, now we explode, we go gold
Peace to the Black Rose, and yo where my francs at?
Cash that shit, where the banks at?
Kill raps, take the whole earth back
Fuck that, Sunz of Man year, I make it happen

You're not promised tomorrow
(You know what I'm saying)
We are living by the bottle
(The pages of life turn every day)
Be careful what you follow
(Word up, check this one)

[Verse 1: Hell Razah]
Guns, clips, carried by cliques, eighty six
Same shit nine six the old and young switch
Poor verses rich, wars and conflicts hit
Politics get rich off the Bloods and the Crips
Slaves shoot slaves, modern day Egypt
Brooklyn convicts is conned to be vic'd
Harassed by the cops from up the block precinct
Fugitives forever they choose to live together
Scheme to get cheddar from anybody living better
However, the money getters follow trend setters
Wit black 9 Berettas now they writing jail letters
Government give us guns so we go and kill each other
Handmade drugs destroy our sisters and our brothers
Some turn thieves defeat their seeds and their mothers
Undercover cops under the cover sell Glocks
A free box of shell if you miss any shots
Crack spots and hell only stops burn cells
Pale horses, evil forces, crime bosses
Weak mind double-crossers cause mic forces

[Verse 2: 60 Second Assassin]
If it don't fit don't force it
Can't mix the nine wit the Caucus
Picture the ocean without the saltness
Killas without the forfeit
There's no time without me sixty be the last sec you'll see
Another chance to breathe so save it for some ease
Cause it be a lot of y'all taking in war with no grease
I never seen a time to be so easy for a real O.G
Can't forget Ol' D, 60 Sec back on the set killing spree
It's been a long time
No here from, check it for the well elected
Fans know I'm blessed (power moves) yo, come and fear some
Those with an ear let em hear something
No more light for a fake to live none
Here's one, careers done, here come
The analytical, political, non-superstitial
Biochemical blast the earth by storm words I bomb
For Korans holy Bible, the archer rival
The coming of the Noahs, Mahadis, Messiahs
The street vibers, the burning of all MC's by the fire
The great instead of poles up for hire
The Putnam Avenue shotgun
Up they do run run run they do run run
Now my niggas around the way F.A. rock
To the far rock run sews up the block
Full of bums, get up the sucker trapped
This ain't Halloween take off the mask
Lot of chumps faking jacks
Anty up the money put it in the pot
I wanna see all this trife
Or are niggas gonna get blast fast
No hesitation cause I'm on probation
Niggas think I got loot to be taken
I'm in for the making
Mouthpiece retained so there'll be no vacation
Warning warning a word for the snaking

[Chorus: Hell Razah & Tekitha]
You're not promised tomorrow
(Word up yo, people dying everyday)
We are living in a bottle
(Drugs and gun play)
Be careful what you follow
(Open your eyes kid)
We got four individuals
Each member come together just drop a jewel {repeat sung}

[Verse 3: Prodigal Sunn]
It was my third day in Supreme court, accused as a murder suspect
Caught me blazing wit Tomalin in Guana projects
A young fugitive soldier but still sober ill
Over the hill still, punch a cobra in his grill
Snitches and bitches I reveal, soon to make the devil kneel
Writing his will for what, for how he got a sway pill
That'll be the day that my skills enhance
Strengthen my stance no longer taking the world by chance
Only got one life to live, so I create, make, then give
Keep it active rolling massive intelligent
As the days went blood stains still remain on the pavements
Spear razor sharp, another adolescent shot
Corrupted cops, yo this shit gotta stop

[Outro: Prodigal Sunn]
Word up man, shit gotta stop man
(You're not promised tomorrow)
Niggas is dying everyday
(We are living in a bottle)
When are you going to realize man
This shit is for real out here man
Word up man niggas got to keep their eyes open man
Keep your head above water
(Be careful what you follow)
Because you know why man?
We all we got
Thats my word man
Y'all niggas don't realize it man
We all gon burn in the motherfucking fire man
Thats word up man
Peace to all my brethrens[Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
See let a nigga come through with that bullshit
Any time you pop that shit nigga
I'ma tell you you can suck a dick, you can suck a pussy
I know, it'll come to what? Say what?
Now I'ma let all you motherfuckers know
See them knows that this is something you can't fuck
Whether you from Brooklyn, whether you from Manhattan
You from Queens nigga
I don't give a fuck, where you be motherfucker!
Where you reside... motherfucker!
How you live? How you seeeeeeee

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Sort the stack outs, this one's the blackout
Three-fifty-seven to your mouth, blaaow!!

[Buddha Monk - Brooklyn Zu]
Dunn can you hear me? Raw is how I'm inflicting this
It's that G type slang that makes this real sickening
Ignite the styles, I got my hand upon the trigger
Starts from the smallest and hits the bigger nigga

[Prodigal Sunn - Sunz of Man]
Yo, straight out the live by them hell fires
A known mental killer, born thriller, assassin of terror
A hot bloody fatal mixture of carbonate water
Homicidal manslaughter, death is the order
Start the mission, travel like the speed of wind
Through the valley of sin, I step to ville and murdered many man
Serving justice in my vicinity

[Zu Keeper - Brooklyn Zu]
(This is, Brooklyn, Zu!!)
Za-za-za, za-za-za
Zuh-za-zah, z-zz-zz-z-z-zz-zz-z-dah-duh-dnn-duh

[Murdoc - Brooklyn Zu]
I get down, I get down, I crack your fucking crown
Lay around and watch some real niggas break ground
I can't shop cause every bro blowing up the spot
Hit rocks and niggas know

[Killah Priest - Sunz of Man]
Yo! Niggas grab the mic like the bites of a scorpion
Nervous, that's why the Zu brought me in
Now bring em forth, like the tortures at the courts
Before the case begin, first break me in
His brain! And make sure he can't maintain the calmness
Ya harmless, watch how I bomb this
Stage like mail appears to be the Moon
Now your Posse is your fucking Platoon
Stale sound just flows through the air
I'm like a ninja, once I send ya downstairs
Then I get furious, imperious, the lyricist with the clearest rhyme
Erupt to deduct your fucking mind

[12 O'Clock - Brooklyn Zu]
Fuck shit up on the hurry-up
Known for burying ducks through more styles than a monk
Warning you chump, brain is out for lunch
Given the power punch, soon to be paid like Donald Trump
Never fall victim to no bitch
Jerked my dick, but still got more hoes than a pimp
And score more points than Shawn Kemp
Keeping powerfully strong like the center on the Knicks

Hut one, hut two, hut three, hut!!
Ol Dirty Bastard live and uncut

(Shame on a nigga who tried to run game on a...)

[Shorty Shit Stain - Brooklyn Zu]
Got more props than the President
My hardcore represent, blowing niggas back who never had this
Cause I'm gifted, so you can gift wrap the shit
I'm kicking and send it to your moms for Christmas
And tell her Shorty Shit Stain sent it
Soon to have more green than the Jolly Green Giant
Cause niggas rap styles just down, it's expired
You should of stayed home instead of picking up a microphone
But if you wanna run on up, like you tough
I call your bluff and blow you down with my hardcore stuff
I shine like twenty-four carat

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Roll and stroll with the party scene
Nigga wanna know me as Mr. Clean
Wza-wza-wza-wza-Wu-Tang, flip the script and
Test my skill niggas, you're tripping
Drugged up from sniffing, you're the one who's riffing
I'm not Opie, save that old shit for Andy Griffith
Start to flip, slip cause you're slipping
While you sleep I be the God on point, with Scottie Pippen
As I jump on stage, flip rip a show
Strip and rip a ho, wayyy like Bo
Jackson while I'm still taxing maxing
Relaxing sitting back, silly attraction
Again and again when I rock the jam
Wanna see em up in the air, throw up your hand
Introducing one-man band in town
It's wild, more the style couldn't stand nigga
When the jump stepped to the center
Of the rhyme inventor, MCs come at the
You get dap slapped, across the MC map
Your ass that's your ass on a whore shot
Come on through I black and blue your whole crew
Then I get Rudy with the Hong Kong Foo
Ol Dirty Bastard, MC killer
Money maker, Brooklyn, Shaolin style
That I lay down like tile, then I get higher

[60 Second Assassin - Sunz of Man]
Here comes the illlll, type ruffer
Style be untouched I'm leavin broken down grammars on the pen
Who who what? What brings it? Tighter than your anus
Chambers this name is for the deepest trainers
Keep it stainless, steel, on time it is the windmill
Deadly venom kills, at the last of the Sam's Mill
60 Second, nucleus, attack on your set
Hit you with the blast (yo close the door)
Shabazz!!
*gun blast*Shining Star!

Intro : Ol' Dirty Bastard

Yeah, knah I'm sayin'?
This is what you call making history right here
The Fifth Element
Earth, Wind, Fire, Sunz Of Man knah I'm sayin'?
We got the Wu-Tang Clan in the house, knah I'm sayin'? ODB
Yo Wyclef play the guitar man!
The earth is approximately covered underwater
? street walks for surfers
The sun & moon had attract the power
While it's on it's way around the sun

Verse 1: Ol' Dirty Bastard

I'm the Eddie Kane of the Wu-Tang
Osirus with the fire-extinguisher slang
Maintain this paradise on this earth
With the shut the fuck up style
For what this shit is worth
Watch a nigga catch a purse
Super-hero niggas die
Do my dirt, get away and multiply

Verse 2:

Hey yo entrepeneur wisdom ? who
The dark kahlua, the black sire
Smack fire out of the liar
My heart desire
Speak truth and light this fire
The clever writer, not lia, never retire
The child teacher, mouth speaker, earth seeker, wind blower
To the seas I'm like Noah

Chorus (2x): Earth Wind & Fire

You're my Shining Star, no matter who you are
Shining bright to see, no matter who's with me

Verse 3:

Uh, hey yo this masterpiece be exclusive and fascinating
Street knowledge education
Teach the seeds son no procrascinatin'
Ghetto learnin' graduatin'
Blessed be the ones with patience from the ancient
God bless the child that could hold his own
Little shorties don't trust a soul it's all globe control
Earth Wind & Fire, Sunz Of Man, and Wyclef
We connect like unanex and bring the intelect
We teach both sex, Brooklyn to Tibet, male or female
Who follow footsteps and correct

Verse 4:

I'm a Shining Star, beam of light from out far
Hits like these would burn holes through our resevoir
Espionage, let it be known who take charge
Come hard with the underground like camouflage
Keep it bizarre, mainstream for the young teens
Though if it don't be for clearance till 13

Chorus (2x): Earth Wind & Fire

You're my Shining Star, no matter who you are
Shining bright to see, no matter who's with me

Verse 5:

Escapin' the ghetto
Using the bass tempo or treble
In the streets we carry heavy metal
Roll with the devil
Yo son life is reality, reality is life
People livin' trife, the world filled with strife
The god's livin' right in this act too many lack
Black on black crime
No vest, another nigga laid to rest

Verse 5: 62nd Assassin

It's been a long time
The beat's certain
Sunz of Man behind deens of wall searchin'
The heat is perkin' Earth Wind & Fire burnin'
Sensation yearnin' and learnin' situation
Wyclef platinum hits
Beach nation is what your life could truly be anticipation

Chorus (2x): Earth Wind & Fire

You're my Shining Star, no matter who you are
Shining bright to see, no matter who's with me

Verse 6: Ol' Dirty Bastard

Yo, yo, yo, yo, when I was young I taught how to produce
The science of babies gettin' loose
I turn white boys to Springsteins' Bruce
Blacks to blues
To the Chinese I gave Bruce
I can't help it if my style is foggy
Words to boogie getcha high on my patio
Or come to see me movie
Girls your walking on my dirt
I'm all in ya hair
Or mike your life plane call hurt

Verse 6:

To all my shining stars
From here to L.A. to Mars
Growin' up in the ghetto where times is hard
No matter who ya are
You a child or God
Born as a king not a slave for jobs
It's much more to life then to drink at bars
Large bank accounts and these fancy cars
Little King Tut's scheemin' when they lust
They get handcuffed for diamiond ring cuts

Chorus (repeat till end): Earth Wind & Fire

You're my Shining Star, no matter who you are
Shining bright to see, no matter who's with me[Intro: 9th Prince]
Attention, Soldiers! Kill every one of them!

The Killa Sin, [ha] the RZArector....

[Killa Sin]
I gotta get a grip, an edge on life, I'm living trife, G
I'm shiesty, now I see why nobody likes me
It might be the image project that I selected
But 'F' it, shit is mad real as well as hectic
Inspect it, your vest and got tested
Suggestions molesting my thoughts I manifested, but check it
My mind was designed for crime, the bottom line
Cause it's my time to shine with the nickel-plated nine to a spine
And ain't no remorse in my source of madness
With my temper, my anger rises like my status
Because I'm known on the borough of Shaolin for wilding
Don't think that it's peace when I be smiling
A heart stone-cold is what I own, for niggas who brag
I break bones leave 'em ungagged and hear them moan
I hate snakes on that fake shit
I get mad, leave 'em shooken up bad like when the quake hit
I got a steezo that's raw, man
Another brother provoked and gun-smoked, now that's all, damn
Why did he marvel the father of horror
Knowing full well that he won't live to see tomorrow
Be on your guard when I start to flip shit, I'm sick
Word to God, it's hard to get a grip

[9th Prince]
I brings a streaking iron flame, like Hell was steeling Heaven
Clips and shovels deeper than the shallow trenches of the brethren
I burst like lions ____ the slaughter
Then I assume my human facility, I plan a hit to the governor
Open, open, behold the gift, designed to kill many men
I stick 'em for billiard pins
Like caving some world in, flashing death like lightning from the Heavens
Leaving rappers suffering the thirst of a silent curse
That came from the Earth when the planet was reversed
Here are the needles, see that he dies
From the effect of a drug, come bleeding out of his eyes
I chop off his feet, so he can't walk and talk, then he claims to stalk
I shove him with pitchfork and stack up dead corpse
A Soldier of the Darkness, kidnap an MC for a hostage
Then break loose on the stage
Trading places like slaves being trained, I'm under pressure
Thoughts be acting wild like a child molester
Madman terrorism, today's journalism
Going to war across the country with another organism
Killarmy madness is how we kill 'em

[Prodigal Sunn]
Since the calculations of time which held the life that held the day of
Expiration, steady creation
Mental death, the source of the abomination
I emerge from the house upon your territory
This one, alias Sun of Man no longer deceived by Satan's blend
Here's a ministry fighting wars of demonology
Soldiers have got knowledge, rewriting your sins of reality
Lyrical space, the black neophyte, run a satellite
I should jump deep beyond the depths of my inner sight
Visions of me on the night of a solar eclipse
A-boarding the mothership, taking my last whiff from this polluted mess
Another soul's vibration escapes this cold tunnel of fire
Show alliance, using your brain from the lord sire
I tie your fucking brain up with barbed wire
Infused thoughts left ya bruised, him been condemned
To the rims of Hell, afraid to walk
Reaction, slow-motion, in shock from the explosion
Symptoms of death--left ya choking on your own breath
You better study your literature, seek the scriptures
Biblical folds 'n' scrolls, laced in velour robes
Killah Priest precise, the messenger 60 Second
Hell Razah, bless 'em, overcome the oppression

[Killah Priest]
Hearken as the night darkens
You've been warned that the Priest will soon swarm
Now you'll be done away like the unicorn
With night time as my uniform
And death as my sword, the universal warlord
The Sunz of Man came together for one accord
You can't read about it, it's not a myth
Here's a puncture, to your rib, [pshaw] for a gift
And the only present I'm dealin' with is now
The supreme slayer, I wrote the Book of Isaiah
Layin' bodies down by the layer
Burn 'em before the assembly
And watch his ashes go up through the chimney
They have disguised me as brass before his prayers
And though his words be lost in the air
The reason you felt chained is cause I've been ordained
I tie you up and throw you off a fuckin' plane
And fill up your parachute with more dead bodies
Don't ask me why--it's a fuckin' hobby!
Burn 'em with the fuel, put down ya tool, I laugh at you
(Why?) Because MCs are my footstool

[60-Sec. Assassin]
You enter the hocus pocus, perhaps the dopest
Tote this, for those all with dope shit
Focus, I blood-shot your lyrics with cirrhosis
Ferocious sound effects break the "glaucosis"
Insanity enters humanity like an enemy
Invade your central nervous system like an advent
Mathematically schematic, I'mma panic, couldn't hold on to a tablet
Semantic, goes through your system like an addict
Bomb glistenin', watch for the blow, I deliver it
Faster stroll, you wrote, minute, barrier, delinquent
Grabs your soul, magnetic flux be out of control
I'm leavin' peeps serviceable, sell his soul to the toilet bowl
All your possessions I own for my own
The chemical, you clone, "comatosis," the syndrome
The Rip-Van, the Winkle, twinkle twinkle
You caught up with your days now, organism star
What part, whistle heart, intruders travel so far
Not even the master chart would put ya arteries back apart
From Allah, this technique is so odd, odd, odd....***Chorus: 60 Second Assassin***
Strange eyes keep on watching me
I see those strange eyes keep on watching me
Strange eyes keep on watching me
I see those strange eyes keep on watching me

[Blue Raspberry]
(Strange eyes...)
If things don't go we can work it out
When problems occur we can talk it out
Niggas all round up for another fight
They round up tight trying to get that money right
I'll be happy when I see the stress is gone
But the devils won't let 'em learn right from wrong
When I wake up, get up and get it straight
If I don't do it now, it might be too late

***Chorus: Blue Raspberry***

***Chorus: 60 Second Assassin***

[12 O'Clock]
You right, see?
What's up, nigga? Let's go steal a coup
And practice kung fu on the roof next to the pigeon coup
And keep the stack like the big boy Cadillac
Fourty eight tracks, got my voice on the DAT
Samurai style for them niggas actin wild
And them jealous motherfuckers throwing boo's in my crowd
Steve Rifkin feel 'em proud, Wu made it loud
Now them nine can't relax, Killarm' throw swords on tracks
Unite my Kingdom, Family Royal
When Brooklyn Zu saw you, it's a Sunz of Man jam
Allah, be the black man, '97 banned
Prob'ly million fans, niggas own this land

***Chorus: 60 Second Assassin & Blue Raspberry***

[60 Second Assassin, (Blue Raspberry)]
My niggas if you're uptight, time to get this money right
(My niggas if you're uptight, time to get this money right)
We run the million dollar scams with this bird in our hands
(We run the million dollar scams with the bird in our hands)
Grab save your sword from self and I swings my for delf
(Grab your sword from self and I swings my for delf)
Grab save your sword from self and I swings my for delf
(Grab your sword from self and I swing my for delf)

[Prodigal Sunn]
Yo, I'm never lonely in the battlefield
The apple they kill, official blood spill
]From Bed-Stuy, East New York, the face of Brownsville
This sound is real, I astound, reveal
I peal a 7 mil', addicted to dope, coke and crills
On the street corner, they sleep on us, we keep burners
See them lame guys with strange eyes? It don't concern us
Bloods and Crips, automatic slugs to whip
We quit the drug shit, now we on some music and shit
Living this ghetto dream, settle mellow out with CREAM
My thousand man team, samurai king, keeping our thoughts clean
Keeping our thoughts clean, turn off your high beams

***Chorus: 62nd Assasin & Blue Raspberry (x4)***[Chorus: Ann Peebles (sample)]
You think you got it all set up
You think you got the perfect plan
You think you got it all setup
You think you got the perfect plan

[Verse 1: Hell Razah]
We break your plans up, Sunz of Man, what?
Throw your hands up
Stand up soldierly, enemies close to me
The president shipping coke to me, the same one that threw a rope on me
Pick on dead brains like the vultures be
Build like construction, bring plans destruction
Malfunction your internet with intellect
There's doors in the Sunz of Mansion you ain't enter yet
Booby trap you like Solomon's Temple
Caught you tryna steal a jewel out my mental
Who sent you? Devils drive your soul like a rental
The hell what we been through, since we stopped speaking Hebrew
We got robbed, stuck up with needles
Be careful they need you, they plan to delete you
My seed's soon will lead you, it's good versus evil

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: 60 Second Assassin]
Undollar, black power to destroy the real McCoy
We off the roof, oh yeah
One hundred proof, my plans
Sunz got it locked up, oh yeah
Chase begin with Vodka, oh yeah
Sunz of Man, could stop us, the plan
Set up perfect why flop us, my man
It be me and you, oh yeah
Down by the river, oh yeah
Without guns and triggers, Wu man
Sunz plan is perfect, don't dare
Think what I know when the nine ran
To the eight to the nine to the two g's
Never plan to fail, never fail to plan

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Killah Priest]
Sleeping on Persians, we used to wear turbans
Daughters were virgins, gold slippers, now they go-go strippers who can't hold they liquor, they fight and bicker
Gssip throughout the projects, no logic
Jobless, digging out garbage, no welfare with no health care
The pain is felt here
They deceive Eve with TV's
Turned her into a species, won't feed the seed
The government raise the rent
Birth control pills, we owe mills
The black man and the black woman can't get along
Because Ricki Lake is on with two horns
Let's take it back to the applejacks hat
Before they shackled blacks
We was above things, we was supreme
Now we drug fiends
Shooting dope in our bloodstreams, we love cream
We love dreams, when their feet are soft
Coming up to me with three fourths, tryna get the freak off
But you know Priest thoughts, if knowledge is a free course
Keep your knees crossed
I can see fork tongue taught when I was young by the older
Brush it off our shoulders

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Hell Razah]
This plan ain't written we be living it
Wisdom flow ocean leak to deep to swim in it
Women, Lil' Kim and them instead of being militant
Be feminine, you guilty or innocent?

[Verse 5: 60 Second Assassin]
Rap black internationalist, niggas kill me with that old fashion shh
Claiming buy this, they ain't real with they topics
Claiming worldly knowledge, you get tossed like the Thomasses
It is a promise, kid, your English will get buff and
Based on like David then Rufffin
Your whole majors is frontin, tripling your front loot
So why y'all still thieving from the Sunz of Man independent group?
Information must be leaking out my faucet
True, out the blue and still ain't nothing new
In the Sunz whipping, even as it was written, as it was written

[Ann Peebles (sampled)]
You think you got it all setup

[Verse 6: Prodigal Sunn]
Interception of your production, self-destruction of the Sun Of Man
Never thought the alien, would eventually make grands
Hand in hand, peace to black man, woman, and child
Juveniles rock the poor, dedicated to Rikers Isle
The young peace and liberated, some deceased or separated
Non-educated, rated out-dated, they never made it
Swift wisdom precision, Islam my definition
The coalition make solid brolic wise decision
Snakes missing the fiction, out of jurisdiction
Too late to listen, I watch you burn my competition

[Chorus]

[Outro: 60 Second Assassin]
I'm your father, I'm your daddy, I'm your brother
Asiatic, I'm your doctor, when you bleed
From heroin, teach your seeds
What they need, is true knowledge
From the tree, to be free
I'm your Sun of Man, I'm your Sun of Man[Intro: Killarmy]
Wake the fuck up (12X)

[Chorus: Killarmy & Sunz of Man]
Yo wake the fuck up or get broke the fuck up
The wisdom we apply Son soak this shit up
If it was sess, y'all niggas would smoke this shit up
So wake the fuck up or get broke the fuck up

[Verse 1: 9th Prince]
We are the street soldiers of the dark side of the planet
I give killing orders like a lieutenant
Hit the planet Earth then explode like a human cannon
The universal author, born to kill saga
Giving niggas head trauma
Bulletproof shield is made of gold armor
Brain surgeon is aversions my purging mind urban
Scientists found killed and wrapped up in curtains
Casualties, flashbacks, now simply that
I attack like Iraq, serious as a heart attack
Professional assassinator professor
Assassinate your mindstate and broke the metal plate
Lyrical Nostradamus, psychotic mind of Saddam, ex-con
Attack the Pentagon with unorthodox firearm from Vietnam
I crucify em, like Muslims murdering Jews from Jerusalem
Now who's the supreme lyricist? You can't seize this
When I die, my name will be worshipped like Jesus
War visual individual incriminate the criminal
My culture nickel put holes in your face like dimples

[Chorus: Killarmy & Sunz of Man]

[Verse 2: Hell Razah]
Brains get unfrozen when they oppose, as we unfold
Futuristic scrolls that was prophesized scriptures
Hitting an untold, I roll with my skull and bones
Made of solid gold, skin is closing up approach your home
With a war, Armageddon in my home
Wisdom mind ruler mental intruder from the Tribe of Judah
Devils disappear like they went through the Bermuda Triangle Erupting on Rzarector tracks like volcanoes
So God swear to me
I appear two years here for revolution in the burning constitution
Learned too much, came off must return
Observe the facts, delivered by blacks
Soon as we unite the sky cracked
A group of UFOs formed a seven in the heavens
Gods celebrated devils death day signal
Jail let loose the criminals, bystanders died
Waiting for miracles we giving you

Chorus: 1/4

[Verse 3: Killa Sin]
Yo, I make your heart thump like tree stumps
Be cracking concrete chumps released once
The Earth shifts, vocal points clips he wrote and missed
Killer vocalist, load his fist blessed with loaded gifts
Golden clips, shotty slipped like psychotic hits
In soldier flicks, who wrote the shit superior
Mines combine the modus click
Enterprise like German spies, keep my eyes on Soviets
Stay Russian my direction I'm wetting like a leaf bone
Freak poems, seek thrones, to call home where freaks bone
To each his own, chrome zones, be cloned like chromosomes
So the chrome, the golden toned champ whip rolling bones
Fire's on, blazin hot trails at night, Baronville
Shotty still collaborating on tracks with Bobby Steels
Generate a mill', Killa Bee law, kill or be killed
Know the Ledge, finally our justice has revealed

Chorus

[Verse 4: Prodigal Sunn]
The 43rd conviction, incarcerated in hell for eternity
But my mentality and chemistry made me celestial through the galaxy
Sparks friction, generating through evaporation
Slay through meditation, your body is now liquidation
Even your haemoglobin is swollen with corrosion
Amputated and rated physical zone disintegrated
That's what niggas face when fucking with the Sunz of Man
Go to the dungeon I could lead a hundred men, with a golden pen
Forced to intercept with the click from Shaolin
Killing devils, scatter they ashes over the sea of Mediterranean
That's my trademark, PS burned in my victims heart
I be the Star from afar illuminating through the dark
Another burning face of death
The initiation of the Mason, 186 my name's left in the Book of Revelation
Reminiscing about the days, raising hell
Representative of a mind, able to lead a city what technicality of mankind
Mistake trying to keep me behind the closed doors of reality
All three eyes to the revolution can now escape the blind state of confusion
Trials and tribulations of the original nation
Leaves a headache, the only chance of elevation
Unite with the black coalition
Sunz of Man, Population Click, Wu-Tang Clan
First the Killarmy eat your skeletons, buried in the Promised Land

You better wake the fuck up!
That's word life!
Don't sleep!
We don't be having that shit no more!
Word is bond this is as real as it's going to get
Wake the fuck up (4X)
Killarmy, Wu-Tang Clan
Word word, Shaolin
Wake the fuck up
Get the actual facts
Better fucking resurrect

Chorus
