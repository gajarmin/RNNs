Get some new carbine rifle and some new gear
A shipment of bullets cause the whole of them near
And some critical labour triangle mouth over there

Ay take a good look at me - Now picture me unhappy
No cash and outta fashion, not flashin
Picture me doin bad even if I wasn't rappin
Picture me even breathe on the mic not snappin
I'm fire hot not lukewarm, my arms frozen
Picture me in a room full of hoes unchosen
Picture me with no P.O. and no 'dro
Picture pimps walk with some broads and ain't gettin no 'tho
L.A. gone and I ain't gotta deal no mo' (Picture that)
A ghetto vision ain't real no mo' (Picture that)
Ah T.I.P. ain't work for MIA no mo'
He still so-so (picture that) he still po'
Nigga picture that, ah matta fact picture T.I.P
Gettin anything other than rich
Now can you picture this, young, pompus, African son of a bitch
Labelled as anything less than "the shit", I can't see it

[Hook - Beenie Man]
Dis bad man you get shot, anyways
Bad man nuh tek back chat, no day
Jamaican bad bwoy seh dat zigga, zigga
We always gonna stay 'pon top always
Dis bad man you get shot, anyways
Bad man nuh tek back chat no day
Jamaican bad bwoy seh dat zigga, zigga
We always gonna stay 'pon top, always

[T.I.]
Pull up in a blue coupe that's damn near clear
And Polo gear that won't drop 'til next year
Be like this here, Cartier frames and Pierre Jouet wristwear
T.I.P. your majesty's right c'here
Notice when I came the dames disappeared, ya lames listen here
To play me, ba-by, hey he
Gone need a track from God featuring Jesus or Jay-Z
Go on floss; ball where it cost
Smile for the cameras, take your shirts off
Y'all niggas actin, take ya skirts off
Hoppin bomb-ass nigga and he ain't wanna work boss
I'm gettin sick and tired off these phony rendetions
Wonder why I don't consider them no competition
There's no vision - lil' ambition
How I feel about these niggas, and my word, are ya kiddin?

[Hook]

[T.I.]
Some niggas wonder what my goal is
They think it's goin gold havin hoes sweatin me
Fuck that, I'm in it for the longevity
Picture me as one of the greatest that'll ever be
Compare me to, 2Pac, B.I.G., and Jay-Z
Work with legends like, Organized No-I-Z., and J.D
Neptunes, they even flow on one of Dre's beats
Fly to Miami, chill with Luke and we can trade freaks
I freak shows, just peep hoes under shade trees
Huh, but KP say just keep it top-notch
And make sure that the club is jumpin like it's hop-scotch
Floss rocks and in the summer keep the top dropped
Ten thousand dolla work for clo', when I go shop
In the Apollo on them 'boes so the hoes jock
Especially when I rock that linen suit with no socks
In Polo skippers, they undo zippers
And they shows cock, to show shot shit
Bitch, I'm serious

[Hook]

[Beenie Man]
Well it's a Neptunes sound (ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
Zagga-zagga-za, na-na-na-na-na (T.I.P.)
Whoa na-na-na-na (Beenie Man)
(Zagga-za-za-za, Oh we dat shit)
An a ziggi-ziggi-zagga (Bad man sittin)
Straight from Jamaica (Alright lemme give this to ya)
Alright lemme tell them somethin (See it's goin down)[Intro: Beenie Man]
(Ay!) It's the remix (refix it), Rock City
Lock city, and si Beenie Man, Rock City
(Let's start it like this)
Oh nah nah nah, nah nah nah, nah nah nah, Rock City
Oh nah nah nah, nah nah nah, nah nah nah, ni!

[Hook: Timothy]
Sim simma, I just wan' buy me a Beamer
Tick tick, blow up! Hiroshima!
Who am I? I'm that nigga!
Who am I? I'm that nigga!

[Verse 1: Beenie Man]
From the Beamer to Bugatti, roll out and lean back
Rock City, realer city, man, I spit fire pon this mean track
Step out to the big crew and bro dem boy no think ya about peacock
The last boy passing place boy passing place a load then they sit back
Out the club, we make the greenery and, welcome to the real game
My diamonds hurts when haters must feel pain
Ferrari pon me key chain, 50 grand for each gem
Girl dem love my rhythm, know St. Moses is my real EM

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Azealia Banks]
Boss bitch and I'm flossy, lost? Bitch I got trophies
Big Benz or that Porschy, ooh, let me get that frosty
Powder bent, Bentley, power bitch, I'm a rare breed
Doing donuts in Raris, be wings on them car keys
Take off in that 4-5, G-glide in that all-white
Chloride, oh my, she roll-ride, I'm so high
Coco in that dope ride, rims blind 'em like sunshine
That money talk and you tongue tied
On them sidewalks while I pop mine, uh
Yup, we got it, yup yup, we know
Y'all never had it, y'all bitches always broke
Yup, we got it, yup yup, we know
Them bitches be the maddest whenever I say hello

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Theron]
Yo, who's that man from Houzin, comin' and he never gon' stop?
Who's that man that come from nothing straight off of the block?
Who's that man that don't say nothing, don't talk to the cops?
Asking the man where they from, you don't know what we do say
We come from the rock! Rock
City's the name, me and you, we not the same
That's why we changing the game, simple and plain
Big man, you know that is weak
When you say "There goes ya chain"
When I was small, used to pick up girls in safaris!
Now I pickin' up punanis in Ferraris!

[Verse 4: Timothy]
When niggas hear you from a island
First thing that they think is you live on a beach
Grew up in the ghetto where they pack a metal
That will lift you off your feet
They be acting like they want some beef
Until you see 'em in the streets
And find out that they vegetarians
These haters never wanna meet
You should already know who it is
Dem Virgin Island boy
Who runnin' the game and doin' it big
You know what them call me
Timo, Timo, it's Theron brother, Timo
My father name me Timo
When you see me! (Call me Timo)

Real nigga, bitch, I do real shit
Fuckin' with a real one, get your ass dealt with
Talkin' Glock 4 with the kickback
While I'm on the couch, champagne by the 6-pack
Stars on the ceiling bitch, think she in a spaceship
Stones in the Rollie bitch, think she on a day ship
A-Town stayed down, interrogated, not a sound
Soon as them birdie land, ship them bitches outta town
But when you catch the local niggas
Foreign cars at a red light
Caramel thing, yeah them big booty, red type
Where them bad bitches who always ask you what your bread like?
We don't even trip, we just ask 'em what their head like

[Hook + Bridge]

Now yuh dead that mean yuh soul lost
Crushed like a serpent snake under grass (again!)

Body between di board head peep through the glass
Crushed like a serpent snake under grass

[Verse 1]
Meg, peg, Dis a man yuh dead
