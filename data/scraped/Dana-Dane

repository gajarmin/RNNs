Verse 1
-------

Once upon a time, Brooklyn was the scene
In the project that they called Fort Greene
There lived a young man, Cinderfella's his name
To make it interesting it's me, Dana Dane
I lived in a house with my cruel step-dad
And two step-brothers who treated me bad
I cooked, I cleaned, I scrubbed the floors
And I was like an errand boy runnin' to the stores
My brothers, they used to boast and brag:
"We've got fresh gear and you've got rags!"
Even worse than that, to make me feel low
They gave me a straw hat, while they had Kangols
Girls used to say, "Dane, you're so cute
But you gets no rap with them polyester suits"
Well, one day, up the avenue
There was a man surrounded by the Fort Greene crew
He said, "Hear ye! Hear ye! Come one, come all!
The princess is having a royal ball
If you can rap, also dress fresh
You might win a date with the sweet princess"
Well I, um, ran home when I heard the newsflash
I bust through the door, straight to my step-dad
I said "Step-dad, may I?"
And before I could finish, "Hell no!", he replied
My brothers were goin', they were geared down
Even Pops was goin' for a piece of the crown
They flaunted, they haunted, they knew what I wanted
"We can and you can't" is what they taunted
They all stood there laughing in my face
And as they walked out they said, "Clean up this place!"

Chorus
------

(Cinderfella Dana Dane!)
But I'm the rapper Dana Dane with fame
(Cinderfella Dana Dane!)
Yes, I'm the rapper Dana Dane with fame

Verse 2
-------

Well I shrugged, I hissed, "They're all tryna diss
I'd get them back if I had one wish"
Before I could make my thought a phrase
There appeared a man from a puff of haze
He said, "What's up, Dane? My name is Hurb
I'm your fairy godfather, you know it, word!
Now I've came here with the main purpose
Of granting you your fondest wish"
I said, "Hurb, my man, just make me fresh
And I'm sure that I can handle all the rest"
With a snap of his fingers sparks began to shoot
And I was tough and on my body: a slick silk suit
On my feet there was argyle socks
And a fresh pair of Ballys from the Bally shop
I showed him my hat and don't you know
With a snap the hat became a Kangol
Once again his hands began to flow
Then he changed my skateboard into a Volvo
He checked me over, passed me the keys
And said, "One more thing before you leave...
You must return before the stroke of twelve
Or you'll turn back into your old self"

Repeat chorus

Verse 3
-------

I jumped in the Volvo, went on my way
I got to the party 'bout ten, I'd say
It was after eleven when I rocked the mic
And by the time I left the stage the people were hyped
The princess was staring in disbelief
Reflected from her eyes were my gold teeth
She waved her hands like 'Hello! Hi!'
Then gave another gesture like 'Come here, guy'
I left the stage, girls came in flocks
Fists were swingin' from the hard rocks
I heard a sound, not a tick nor tock
Gong! First bell before twelve o'clock
No time to waste, I broke out in haste
The princess followed in a futile chase
A quick steady pace is what I kept
Lost one of my Ballys on one of those steps
For the Volvo I continued my stride
About this time I heard gong five
I was down the block when I heard gong eight
And the princess scream out, "Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!"

Repeat chorus

Verse 4
-------

I was almost home when my luck ran out
And there went my suit, my Kangol and clothes
My fresh Volvo also went too
And there was no denyin' that my night was through
The one Bally shoe the freshest thing I sported
Jumped on my board, for home I skateboarded
Made it to my pad, no time at all
Went to my room, or better yet the four walls
Hid the shoe away still feelin' pleased
Then jumped in my cot to catch some Z's
Early the next morning when I awoke
I threw on me old slippers and me old housecoat
Went into the front, my family stared at me
Sayin' "Wasn't that you?! Nah, it couldn't be"
They kept askin' me as I did my chores
My butt was saved by a knock on the door
"Who is it?", that's what my brothers barked
"The princess", this sweet voice remarked
She said she was lookin' for a certain man
Who could bring her the shoe like the one in her hand
The family ran around with their heads in the air
Bringin' on shoes from everywhere
She just shook her head, a nod of relief
Sayin' "No, that's not the one that I'm lookin' for, chief"
I ran in the room and got my shoe
And said, "Is this the one you're referring to?"
Well she said, "Yes, and you're so cute
But where's your Kangol and slick silk suit?"
I put on the shoe, there came a flash of light
And I was tough in the gear from just last night
Looked out the window, saw the Volvo
Said to my family, "I've got to go"
We drove up the avenue, the princess and I
And in back of me I heard my family cry...

Repeat chorus

(Cinderfella!)
Yes, I'm the rapper Dana Dane with fame
(Cinderfella!)[ Dane ]
Hello, I'd like to see Dr. Slumber, please
[ doctor's assistant ]
Ah - do you have an appointment, sir?
[ Dane ]
No, I don't
But tell the Doctor it's urgent that I see her
[ doctor's assistant ]
Well - just one moment
Dr. Slumber?
Dr. Slumber, there's a young man out here named -
Excuse me, what is your name?
[ Dane ]
Oh, tell her it's Dana Dane
[ doctor's assistant (hysterically) ]
Hhhh... D-D-Dana D-D-DANE?!
OH NO!
OH, YOU CAN COME RIGHT IN!
COME RIGHT IN, RIGHT NOW!
COME ON IN...!
[ Dane ]
Thank you, thank you

Well, I walked into the office, what did I see?
A well-shaped body with the back to me
Sittin in her chair with an all-white gown
Said said (Dana Dane, won't you please lay down?)
She said that she wouldn't reveal her face
Till my hour was up and I was on my way
Now we got to the matter of why I came there
I said, "Doc, I keep havin these crazy nightmares"

Nightmares of the night (nightmares)
Nightmares, they're alright (nightmares)
Cause they just show imagination of reality (nightmares)
Just keep telling yourself that they're make-believe (nightmares)

She said, "Relax yourself, won't you tell me one
So I can diagnose and see what must be done"
I laid back my head, start to inhale
Caught my breath, and then I said, "Well -
Bright one morning I was late for class
Had a fresh pair of frames with Gucci on the glass
Girls they was hawking, dudes they was talkin
Saw the doggy-dogg female, I kept on walkin
She was on it hard, there was no denyin
Shoulda seen what this female was tryin
Grabbin on my shirt, tuggin on my slacks
Pullin on my zipper board, I had to hold her back
Word up, Doc, on the ultimate
Now if I never saw a creature, this girl was it
I kept on walkin, had to leave this place
But she was all up on me, breathin in my face
You may think I'm lyin though it's just a dream
This girl had the baddest breath I'd ever seen
I couldn't think straight, thought I was doomed
Heard a bling-bling-bling, it was time for homeroom
I stepped real quick, she tried to play it sassy
She almost ran me down, this nasty fatnastee
Dipped to the stairs, running blind
Get to my homeroom, ran through my mind
Got to the 4th floor, standin in the door
Girlies watchin me walk down the corridor
The guys they were jealous and gettin mad
And all the girlies wishin they had the class I had
Got to my classroom, expect to see the teacher
Who did I see? That ugly black creature
Paused for a minute standin in the door
Then I broke out when the girlie went raw
Word em up, Doc, couldn't stand the smell
Heard of 3D? Well, she was fat as hell
I ran out the school, I didn't look back
I tell you, Dr. Slumber, this girl was wack
And that's about the time when I awoke
And I smelled that awful breath that almost made me choke
Now tell me, Dr. Slumber, how can it be?
That this dream somehow became reality?
I can't go to sleep, cause I'm so damn scared
Cause I keep havin these crazy nightmares"

Nightmares of the night (nightmares)
Nightmares, they're alright (nightmares)
Cause they just show imagination of reality (nightmares)
Just keep telling yourself that they're make-believe (nightmares)
(Nightmares)

She said, "Listen, Dana Dane, I think I have the cure
But I have to hear one more before I'll be sure"
I laid back my head, tried to concentrate
Then I told her the nightmare 'bout the blind date
Had a blind date with this girl named Anita
The Fever's the place I'm supposed to meet her
Saw the def body with the vicious butt
How did I know she was a marvelous mutt
This lady I met was as ugly as hell
Couldn't go in the jam with this female
I was coughin hard, she started to braggin
Couldn't let them know I was here with this dragon
Grabbed her hand, dipped to Harlem World
But I left this ugly lady for another girl
Now this other female, her name was Denise
Couldn't get no rapture, there followed the beast
Everywhere I turn, everywhere I look
There was Anita the beast, she could not be shook
I dipped, I dived, I ran, I thrived
But there was no place that I could hide
Cause she was sniffin me out like a hungry blood hound
Her tail in the air, her nose to the ground
Only thing left for me to do
Was to set her up with this other dude
Now this other dude, he was real upset
Cause this ugly female he didn't wanna check
He started actin wild, even called me a faggot
What could I do, he had a .22 automatic
I dipped into the crowd, made my way to the door
Bumped into this object and I hit the floor
When I looked up, what did I see?
I saw Anita the Beast lookin down at me
I couldn't try to play it, couldn't try to pretend
Like the AFTCA I had to take the dog in

Nightmares of the night (nightmares)
Nightmares, they're alright (nightmares)
Cause they just show imagination of reality (nightmares)
Just keep telling yourself that they're make-believe (nightmares)
(Nightmares)

Now I pleaded, "Dr. Slumber, I just can't bare
To have another one of these crazy nightmares"
Then all of a sudden she turned around
And starin at me with that all-white gown
With a Catholic smile, showin all her teeth
Was that ugly female, Anita the Beast...

[ Dr. Slumber, her sweet, soft voice turning horrifying ]
Dana?
Dana, honey, wake up!
What's wrong?
Wake up, honey
You are just... HAVING A NIGHTMARE!
A-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
A-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!Next stop: Delancey Street
Step lively, and ah - watch the closing doors

[ VERSE 1 ]
I can't express it any plainer
That I'm a entertainer
People call me Dane, but my real name is Dana
I came here just to put you on
Cause I'm taking the rapping world by storm
In the rap I've made a change
A change that no other out there can claim
Now what I've done will make you laugh
So don't you ever be offended by the words I pass
I'll make you tickle, make your butt wiggle
You'll tell your friends, and they'll chuckle and giggle
Now this little story's called Delancey Street
It's the place where clothes are bought and people meet
Each city has a place that's quite the same
Even though it might go by a different name

Delancey Street
Delancey Stree-eet
Delancey Street
This story can't be beat

[ VERSE 2 ]
Well, I (um) went to Delancey Street to buy some wears
Even though I already had on fresh gear
Go into the store to buy a Kangol
I took out my wallet and my fat money roll
When three females walked up to me
There was a white, a black, the other Chinese
The white girl said, "My name is Dawn
And I love your gear by Louis Vuitton"
The black girl said, "My name is Jane"
And she couldn't keep her hands off the fresh gold chains
The Chinese girl, her name Suchi
She was foggin up the '86 Guccis
I thought they wanted to conversate
Then they all pulled out a six-shooter trey-eight
Three fresh females, who would have thought
Cause they tried to rob me, I almost got caught
I stood there for a minute, tried to concentrate
I tried to think of a way for me to escape
No one in sight, one thing to do
(You mean you ran, Dana Dane?) Damn right I flew
Up the block and through an alley
Yo, I cold dogged my fresh new Bally's
I ran through some water and some dog -
But I don't give a damn, I wouldn't be their vic'
Oh no, not me, not while I had feet
So then I dipped over to Orchard Street
Around the corner, past the brick house
And right in back of me, droolin from the mouth
Yes, them three females at hot pursuit
Then all of a sudden they began to shoot
I flundered, blundred, all the shots thundered
(Where did you run?) That's what I wondered
So confused, my head still in the wind
A sign up the street that read (dead end)

[ VERSE 3 ]
Now here they came, just as plain as day
Runnin down the street like _Three The Hard Way_
I approached the stop, the temper grew
And then the girl screams out: (Yo, damn it, don't move!)
They continued strong like the quiet storm
"Lover boy, run everything that you've got on"
"Run your Gucci, your Louis and your fresh gold chains
And your Bally shoes, we want it all from you"
Now max this move, what could I do?
Nowhere to run, no one to run to
The girls just didn't know who I am
But I knew a way to get out this jam
I stood in their face, took on the loud racket
Opened up my ??? jacket
Printed on my shirt, yes, there's bold and plain
'I'm not the one, the Rapper Dana Dane'
Well, the girls caught the message, it was plain to see
They might as well have said (Dana Dane, you're free)
Cause Jane came by, she winked her eye
And Dawn came over, grabbed me at my fly
And that's about the time when Suchi came near
She kissed me on my cheek and blew in my ear
Each one of them tryin to grab my hand
Screamin "Leave him!," to the other (Dana Dane's my man)
I knew it: they'd blew it
Punches were thrown, they got into it
They rumbled, battled, wrestled like cattle
"She made me do it!", they began to tattle
Swollen eyes and busted lips
Cause I think all of them got pistol-whipped
But I don't care, do you hear what I say?
I just wiped off my Bally's, went on my way
And they're still not friends till this very day[Verse 1]
That's right party people, Dana Dane is back!
Hurby behind the board of the twenty-fo' track machine
Making sure the beats come out clean
As I tell you this tale of a Christmas scene
It all began in a far off land
Do you know the Drummer Boy? Well, I'm the Rapper Man
I wandered and wandered with no main course
Drawn to a campsite by some strange force
Now, in this camp lived three wise men
They said, "Dana Dane, where have you been?"
They said that they had been expecting me
Told me to kick off my sandals and relax my feet
We started to talk, a lot of time was spent
Tale of how emcees wouldn't be content
'Til the Christmas spirit was gone and demolished
And I was the only one who could abolish their plan
So I took a stand!
But they said I must journey across the land
I said, "Listen my friend, I'll be glad to go
But the sand out there is worse than snow"
The first wise man said, "Yes, that's true"
To protect my feet, gave me Bally shoes
The second wise man said, "Yes, you're right"
And gave me a Kangol to shade my eyes
The third wise man, leaning on a cane
Said "Take this mic, rapper Dana Dane!"
He said that the mic would help my words
Of Christmas cheer be clearly heard

[Verse 2]
Well I started my journey at the first light
I travelled the desert for a fortnight
I sighed, I tried, the North Star my guide
Pulled my Kangol over my eyes
Took off my Ballys, dumped the sand on the side
Put my Ballys back on and continued my stride
Off I went through the sand and mist
Taking all types of chances and all kinds of risks
It was Christmas Eve, time was growing short
Then I came upon the place that I had sought
Went up to the door, straight in the palace
Faces were filled with contempt and malice
Up on the stage, what did I see?
That's right, party people -- a sucker emcee
Went up on the stage, plugged in my mic
To the sucker emcee I said "Good night!"
Off he went, he was steaming mad
Talk about relief! The crowd was glad
I said, "Have no fear, cause I am here
To wish a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year"
I continued on, they began to believe
And the Christmas spirit was soon retrieved
The fingers were popping, the house cold rocking
Talk about staring -- girls were cold clocking
Mission complete, I was on my way
Girls in back of me screaming, "Dane, please stay!"
But I couldn't cause I had done my thing
And as I walked out the door I heard them all sing

[Singers]
Sucker emcees, you better watch out!
All emcees, you gotta watch out!
Dana Dane is coming to town

Dana Dane is coming
Dana Dane is coming
Yes, Dana Dane is coming
To townDana Dane
Never gonna let you fade away, away
Dana Dane
Never gonna let you fade away, away
Dana...

[ INTRO ]
Full-circle, 360 degrees Dane
My style will live forever, my fame will be maintained
Now some can't feel this, and some feel can't that
But all can feel a track that's produced by Battlecat
So gather round and listen to my non-fiction
The picture will come clearer than a Sony television
This ain't about dissin, this is all fact
Women on my nuts cause my vocals makin cash

[ Hook ]
(The Rapper Dana Dane, what time is it?)
She's on the record's jock, she doesn't love me
(The Great Dana Dane, what time is it?)
She's just stressin my fame and my money

[ VERSE 1 ]
I'm bustin this one for Bridget, the ho
I met at the Emmaco pumpin the petrol into her five point o
I wanted her because she looked like Janet Jackson
Caramel complexion, sportin sexy fashion
"Hello, how you're doin?" I said, "they call me Dane"
"I could learn to love your flavor, hon, hey, what's your name?"
She had nothin for me, totally ignored me
High-sided, took it like she never saw me - cool
So I tried again: "What up! How you're feelin?"
Was a hot and humid day, but I felt a cold chill
I figured, let me step before I have to diss her
That's when I overheard her girlfriend try to whisper
(Oh, I know him from somehwere - oh, that's Dana Dane!
I saw him last week, he performed on _Soul Train_)
Now honey flipped the script like Sybill
"You're not the Rapper Dana Dane with fame, is you?
Ooh, I like your records, ooh, you're the man
Ooh, you're so fine, I'm your number one fan"
Now she knows that I'm the Dane, all of a sudden I'm accepted
Ridin on my nuts cause I'm pumpin out hit records

[ Hook ]

[ VERSE 2 ]
Next I peeped this honey at the bar scopin the Dane hard
Loud, money proud, yo, I knew her ho card
Native New Yorker, Brooklyn fast-talker
Big jewelry-sporter, sippin Johnny Walker
She bought me this drink, she's flashin her cash
She passin me hints like she wanna give me the ass
I avoided her because I knew her man Pedro
She said (Dana, fuck him, let's talk about your stage show!)
You ??? well, there ain't no brother brother
Hands on my pants, woulda yoked it if I let her
She was gettin tippsy, dancin like a gypsy
Seen her before, but never knew she was this frisky
Tried to break lips, but she wasn't tryin to have it
Playin me close like ??? metal to a magnet
Then she shouted: "Dane, I can't wait to get you naked!"
Ridin on my nuts cause I'm pumpin out hit records

[ Hook ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
Now last but not least, let me tell you 'bout Judy
Baaya with the tattas, booya with the booty
A cutie with a juicy fat coochie
Felt it was my duty to make her sing like Suzy
??? 'Cha-ya-ya-ya...' - recall the flavor?
From the first album that the Dane ever gave ya
Anyway, no more delay, she was a hard nut to crack
Kicked the rap like a mack, but she wouldn't give me jack
But still she's in my grill every time that she sees me
Askin (When you're comin with that new fat release?)
Well, I seen her 'bout a weak about, I told her 'bout a week or so
"Wouldn't you like to be in Dana Dane's video?"
Now she started clickin, dissed her in addition
Comin to my crib for the private audition
Again the same game, just a different scenario
Ridin on my nuts to play a part in my video
Must be the music
That's makin her flip
Must be the music
Must be the music

Johnny the Dipper, I think you're movin too fast

A baby boy was born, the mother died at birth
His father ran away, that made it even worse
Now he was passed along to his next akin
That was his mother's brother, known as Uncle Len'
He bought him a car of his very own
Got him an education and a decent home
But just when the lad became of age
Uncle Lenny thought he'd teach him his only trade
He said, "Johnny, my boy" - that was the laddie's name
"You're about to learn the pickpocket game
Now pay close attention, cause you gotta be quick
But most of all, be smooth and slick"
He studied his uncle for hours on in
And Lenny did the move for him again and again
Then one day Johnny screamed with glee
"I got it, I got it, see, Unc', see?"
"Now hold on," he said, "son, there's one more rule
Use your gift wisely, don't be no fool"
"Yeah, Unc', yeah," he said half-hearted
Little did Lenny know what he had just started
Cause now Johnny's dippin right and left
He did a year in the pen, two counts of theft

Yeah, they caught me this time
But wait till I get back out, man
No one will be able to touch me
Not even my uncle Lenny the Lifter
You understand what I'm sayin?
Yo, you know who I am?
I'm Johnny the Dipper!

Johnny the Dipper, beware of your past
Johnny the Dipper, I think you're movin too fast

Now Johnny the Dipper is the name he earned
Out on probation, and he still hasn't learned
Cause he's hawkin the walls of the high school halls
Schemin and scamin in the shopping mall
He skip, dip, take a wallet from the hip
Victims risky, but he was quick as a whip
Paid for days, his wallet gettin fatter
Johnny was the Dipper, nothin else mattered
Scoopin all them honeys, shit was great
Until he made his fatal mistake
He dipped on a man called Bobby Vino
Mafia king for the gambling casinos
Now Bobby was a hood who demanded respect
His pocket was picked and he was highly upset
He asked all his boys: now who would dare rob the
Undisputed king of the mobsters?
He sent Joe Crazy and [Name] Dan
Out on the mission to find their man

Yo, find Lenny the Lifter
And make him pay, eh?

He-he-he
Wait till my uncle sees my big pay-off
He's gonna be jealous, he-he-he

Johnny the Dipper, beware of your past
Johnny the Dipper, I think you're movin too fast

Now Johnny overjoyed with escapades
Went home to his uncle with the money he made
When he got home, well, the door wide open
A gun on the floor, the barrel still smokin
He stops, stares, his face full of fear
As he sees the results of his dipping career
Happy days it was to be, but no, instead
Lenny tied to a chair with a bullet in his head
He screams, "I'm sorry, I return every penny"
But Johnny, you've dipped one time too many

Oh Uncle..
Uncle Lenny!
What I have I done!
Uncle Lenny
Talk to me..

Johnny the Dipper, beware of your past
Johnny the Dipper, I think you're movin too fastArtist: Dana Dane

Verse 1
-------

Once upon a time, Brooklyn was the scene
In the project that they called Fort Greene
There lived a young man, Cinderfella's his name
To make it interesting it's me, Dana Dane
I lived in a house with my cruel step-dad
And two step-brothers who treated me bad
I cooked, I cleaned, I scrubbed the floors
And I was like an errand boy runnin' to the stores
My brothers, they used to boast and brag:
"We've got fresh gear and you've got rags!"
Even worse than that, to make me feel low
They gave me a straw hat, while they had Kangols
Girls used to say, "Dane, you're so cute
But you gets no rap with them polyester suits"
Well, one day, up the avenue
There was a man surrounded by the Fort Greene crew
He said, "Hear ye! Hear ye! Come one, come all!
The princess is having a royal ball
If you can rap, also dress fresh
You might win a date with the sweet princess"
Well I, um, ran home when I heard the newsflash
I bust through the door, straight to my step-dad
I said "Step-dad, may I?"
And before I could finish, "Hell no!", he replied
My brothers were goin', they were geared down
Even Pops was goin' for a piece of the crown
They flaunted, they haunted, they knew what I wanted
"We can and you can't" is what they taunted
They all stood there laughing in my face
And as they walked out they said, "Clean up this place!"

Chorus
------

(Cinderfella Dana Dane!)
But I'm the rapper Dana Dane with fame
(Cinderfella Dana Dane!)
Yes, I'm the rapper Dana Dane with fame

Verse 2
-------

Well I shrugged, I hissed, "They're all tryna diss
I'd get them back if I had one wish"
Before I could make my thought a phrase
There appeared a man from a puff of haze
He said, "What's up, Dane? My name is Hurb
I'm your fairy godfather, you know it, word!
Now I've came here with the main purpose
Of granting you your fondest wish"
I said, "Hurb, my man, just make me fresh
And I'm sure that I can handle all the rest"
With a snap of his fingers sparks began to shoot
And I was tough and on my body: a slick silk suit
On my feet there was argyle socks
And a fresh pair of Ballys from the Bally shop
I showed him my hat and don't you know
With a snap the hat became a Kangol
Once again his hands began to flow
Then he changed my skateboard into a Volvo
He checked me over, passed me the keys
And said, "One more thing before you leave...
You must return before the stroke of twelve
Or you'll turn back into your old self"

Repeat chorus

Verse 3
-------

I jumped in the Volvo, went on my way
I got to the party 'bout ten, I'd say
It was after eleven when I rocked the mic
And by the time I left the stage the people were hyped
The princess was staring in disbelief
Reflected from her eyes were my gold teeth
She waved her hands like 'Hello! Hi!'
Then gave another gesture like 'Come here, guy'
I left the stage, girls came in flocks
Fists were swingin' from the hard rocks
I heard a sound, not a tick nor tock
Gong! First bell before twelve o'clock
No time to waste, I broke out in haste
The princess followed in a futile chase
A quick steady pace is what I kept
Lost one of my Ballys on one of those steps
For the Volvo I continued my stride
About this time I heard gong five
I was down the block when I heard gong eight
And the princess scream out, "Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!"

Repeat chorus

Verse 4
-------

I was almost home when my luck ran out
And there went my suit, my Kangol and clothes
My fresh Volvo also went too
And there was no denyin' that my night was through
The one Bally shoe the freshest thing I sported
Jumped on my board, for home I skateboarded
Made it to my pad, no time at all
Went to my room, or better yet the four walls
Hid the shoe away still feelin' pleased
Then jumped in my cot to catch some Z's
Early the next morning when I awoke
I threw on me old slippers and me old housecoat
Went into the front, my family stared at me
Sayin' "Wasn't that you?! Nah, it couldn't be"
They kept askin' me as I did my chores
My butt was saved by a knock on the door
"Who is it?", that's what my brothers barked
"The princess", this sweet voice remarked
She said she was lookin' for a certain man
Who could bring her the shoe like the one in her hand
The family ran around with their heads in the air
Bringin' on shoes from everywhere
She just shook her head, a nod of relief
Sayin' "No, that's not the one that I'm lookin' for, chief"
I ran in the room and got my shoe
And said, "Is this the one you're referring to?"
Well she said, "Yes, and you're so cute
But where's your Kangol and slick silk suit?"
I put on the shoe, there came a flash of light
And I was tough in the gear from just last night
Looked out the window, saw the Volvo
Said to my family, "I've got to go"
We drove up the avenue, the princess and I
And in back of me I heard my family cry...

Repeat chorus

(Cinderfella!)
Yes, I'm the rapper Dana Dane with fame
(Cinderfella!)[Verse 1]
That's right party people, Dana Dane is back!
Hurby behind the board of the twenty-fo' track machine
Making sure the beats come out clean
As I tell you this tale of a Christmas scene
It all began in a far off land
Do you know the Drummer Boy? Well, I'm the Rapper Man
I wandered and wandered with no main course
Drawn to a campsite by some strange force
Now, in this camp lived three wise men
They said, "Dana Dane, where have you been?"
They said that they had been expecting me
Told me to kick off my sandals and relax my feet
We started to talk, a lot of time was spent
Tale of how emcees wouldn't be content
'Til the Christmas spirit was gone and demolished
And I was the only one who could abolish their plan
So I took a stand!
But they said I must journey across the land
I said, "Listen my friend, I'll be glad to go
But the sand out there is worse than snow"
The first wise man said, "Yes, that's true"
To protect my feet, gave me Bally shoes
The second wise man said, "Yes, you're right"
And gave me a Kangol to shade my eyes
The third wise man, leaning on a cane
Said "Take this mic, rapper Dana Dane!"
He said that the mic would help my words
Of Christmas cheer be clearly heard

[Verse 2]
Well I started my journey at the first light
I travelled the desert for a fortnight
I sighed, I tried, the North Star my guide
Pulled my Kangol over my eyes
Took off my Ballys, dumped the sand on the side
Put my Ballys back on and continued my stride
Off I went through the sand and mist
Taking all types of chances and all kinds of risks
It was Christmas Eve, time was growing short
Then I came upon the place that I had sought
Went up to the door, straight in the palace
Faces were filled with contempt and malice
Up on the stage, what did I see?
That's right, party people -- a sucker emcee
Went up on the stage, plugged in my mic
To the sucker emcee I said "Good night!"
Off he went, he was steaming mad
Talk about relief! The crowd was glad
I said, "Have no fear, cause I am here
To wish a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year"
I continued on, they began to believe
And the Christmas spirit was soon retrieved
The fingers were popping, the house cold rocking
Talk about staring -- girls were cold clocking
Mission complete, I was on my way
Girls in back of me screaming, "Dane, please stay!"
But I couldn't cause I had done my thing
And as I walked out the door I heard them all sing

[Singers]
Sucker emcees, you better watch out!
All emcees, you gotta watch out!
Dana Dane is coming to town

Dana Dane is coming
Dana Dane is coming
Yes, Dana Dane is coming
To townFunky
Funky
Funky (scratched)
Funky (scratched)

[Verse 1]
No one knows, but I've been here for a while
I was sitting in the back playing a low profile
Then like expected, well my name would be paged
"Would the rapper Dana Dane please come to the stage?"
Well I slid my seat back still cool, relaxed
Stood up on my feet, gave a tilt to my hat
To the front I walked, yes, still unnoticed
Up on the stage all the eyes would be focused
Then from the left the girlies caught their breath
And said, "There goes the Dane.  He sure looks Fresh"
Now a posse clocked me saying they could rock me?
Mad cause the girlies called and they flocked me
But that didn't phase me
They must of been crazy
Forget about the guys, see, I came for the ladies
And to grab the mic, right?
Hold it tight, like
Recite a hyped type rhyme that I write
And if I may and if I might
Give a little bit of myself tonight

[Hook]
(funky)
Just a little bit of Dane tonight (funky)
Makes you feel alright (ain't it funky)
Just a little Dana rocking you tonight
Makes you want to hold on tight (funky)

[Verse 2]
Now, mic in hand and the people cheered me
"One, two.  One, two. Can everyone hear me?"
"YES" (audience shouting)
So let the party begin
As Clark cuts the record like a swordsman
To a worlwide rhythm that I'll be sporting
Dropped on point by producer Fresh Gordon
I came here to share my lyrical flair
Dana Dane Forever, rapper extraordinaire
Now girls flocked in numbers
And they cry my name
Saying, "He's the [?]" and "We love Dane!"
I couldn't resist. Yeah, I blew them a kiss
"That was for me!"
"No it wasn't you ..."
Hey, no need to fight, so I blew them another
A fella on the side said, "F the mother"
But I told him, "Don't mess with me
You know who the best to be
Listen to the radio, your mother requested me"
I've got a talent, a style, I'm gifted
Those who riff, well, it's time you get lifted
But I didn't come here to fuss or to fight
But to give a little bit of myself tonight

[Hook]
Just a little bit of Dane tonight
Makes you feel alright (ain't it funky)
Just a little Dana rocking you tonight
Makes you want to hold on tight (funky)
Just a little bit of Dane tonight
Makes you feel alright (ain't it funky)
(one, two, three, four, hit it)

[Verse 3]
Well, well, well, the party's heated now
There's no reason for you all to be seated now
Guys, girls do the latest dance move
Those who can't dance well bob to this smooth move
I drive [?] straight up [?]
Is it R&B or cold hard hip-hop?
It doesn't really matter, just have a good time
You better get yours, cause I'm sure to get mine
You never thought the Dane would be this large again my brother?
Bring it on up, I'll sign your album cover
But hold your girl cause I think she's jocking me
Can't you tell by the way that she's clocking me?
Well, at least she's got the right idea
And we can get busy when I'm finished here
Cause she knows how to get things done right
Just get a little bit of the Dane tonight

[Hook x7][Intro: little girl]
One, two, we comin' for you
Cuffie Crime Family, -- for you
One, two, we comin' for you
Cuffie Crime Family, is comin' for you

[Chorus: Freemurda (sample)]
Back in the day, before I was a gangsta
Before I had a two-way, before I had haters
(What we gonna do right here is go back
Go-go-go back, go-go-go back)

[Dana Dane]
Back in the day, it's been a while since I've been a child
But even then, I had impeccable style
Chugalug, chugalug, three dice in a cup
Yo, put down one, you can pick up four bucks
What you know about that, or being in front the building
Stick ball, punch ball, parents give to children
Before the New York Lotto, a dollar and a dream
Runnin' illegal numbers, got young Dane cream
That's when Puma and Fila was hot in the streets
I had British and Valley, wallabies on the feet
God bless Biggie and that nigga Jermaine
But nobody had the Gucci frames before Dana Dane
That when hip hop was young and so was I
You better do what you can now, cuz time flies by
Fort Green original, Dana Dane the original
Kangol Crew, '83, respect the original

[Chorus]

[Freemurda]
Yo, 1982, I came through
August, I burst out my moms womb
There goes a gangsta from out a dark room
C.C.F., ain't a cartoon
On Friday, man this is Cuffie Crime Fam
We supply yay', we move like the highway
Real fast, I'm try'nna see some real cash
Become made like Billy Bath
Back in the days, my niggas would post up
Adidas suits, my goons was roped up
Before I had to go to school wit a bow-cut
Where the whole class laughed, I had to go nuts
Came back to school wit Dirty's rope chain
Rockin', no white tee wit no name
Wit my face on it, that's about to go to post
Wit my face on it, put your cake on it

[Shacronz]
Before I got dough or had a hot flow
I used to sip Calvin coolers rock a leases and lottos
Back flips made mud pies, live the hard one
Five sixty N.V., Ty Teeney, tart one
Suck togas out of turn styles wit straws
Blues jams forced through rocks of the roof kick doors
Made my verse buckin' Key Food packin' bags
Takin' bites from the heist, jackin' mags
Grabbin' ass, no chicks like me
Stole cars out of parking lots, to see me wasn't likely
Swept hair in barbershops, summer jobs at Mr. Carter spot
Or go to Miss Cooper, work for housing wit the super'
Fort Green wreck, high energy, breathe team
Calvin Klein, AJ, Wranglers and Lee Jeans

"Go back - go back - go-go-go-go-go back"

[Chorus 2X]

"Go back" - scratched until the endBedie Boo
Used to be so cute
Now you're kinda loose
Yeah, I know the scoop
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Now Bedie was this girl I graduated from high school with
You know, the type of girl that everybody is real cool with
She didn't smoke or drink, in fact she never ever cursed
She wore the rosary beeds and kept a Bible in her purse
Well, one day she was aligned waiting to get in a night club
Some major group was playing, and everybody was real hyped up
Now Bedie wasn't assort to go to parties of that type
And I couldn't help but wonder why she had came here tonight
Now I didn't ask any questions, I went inside and got a drink
Someone tapped me on my shoulder (Hm, who could it be?) Now let me think
I looked around, and there was Bedie, all dressed up in lace and leather
Boy, I must admit, she really had her act together

Bedie Boo
Used to be so cute
Now you're kinda loose
Yeah, I know the scoop
About you Bedie now
You're livin kinda foul
Been skeezin for a while
Until it gets around
Oh-oh-oh Bedie Boo

(Hello, remember me?) I said, "Oh yes, of course I do
You're the girl from science class that I used to sit next to"
She started givin hints like she wanted me to hit it
(Was you with it?) Well, you know.. (Yo, was you with it?) Yeah, I was with it!
I led her to this room, the door said 'V.I.P.'
Only for people with juice, and of course that meant me
I said, "Gosh, how you changed, Bedie, you sure look, different"
(But you said she was religious) I can see now that she isn't
She got on her knees and started reachin for my zipper
I sang this little song right before, you know, I did her

Bedie Boo
You used to be so cute
Now you're kinda loose
Yeah, I know the scoop
About you Bedie now
You're livin kinda foul
Been skeezin for a while
Until it gets around
Oh-oh-oh Bedie Boo

[ repeated till fade ]Once upon a time, Brooklyn was the scene
In the project that they called Fort Greene
There lived a young man, Cinderfella's his name
To make it interesting it's me, Dana Dane
I lived in a house with my cruel step-dad
And two step-brothers who treated me bad
I cooked, I cleaned, I scrubbed the floors
And I was like an errand boy runnin' to the stores
My brothers, they used to boast and brag:
"We've got fresh gear and you've got rags!"
Even worse than that, to make me feel low
They gave me a straw hat, while they had Kangols
Girls used to say, "Dane, you're so cute
But you gets no rap with them polyester suits"
Well, one day, up the avenue
There was a man surrounded by the Fort Greene crew
He said, "Hear ye! Hear ye! Come one, come all!
The princess is having a royal ball
If you can rap, also dress fresh
You might win a date with the sweet princess"
Well I, um, ran home when I heard the newsflash
I bust through the door, straight to my step-dad
I said "Step-dad, may I?"
And before I could finish, "Hell no!", he replied
My brothers were goin', they were geared down
Even Pops was goin' for a piece of the crown
They flaunted, they haunted, they knew what I wanted
"We can and you can't" is what they taunted
They all stood there laughing in my face
And as they walked out they said, "Clean up this place!"

(Cinderfella Dana Dane!)
But I'm the rapper Dana Dane with fame
(Cinderfella Dana Dane!)
Yes, I'm the rapper Dana Dane with fame

Well I shrugged, I hissed, "They're all tryna diss
I'd get them back if I had one wish"
Before I could make my thought a phrase
There appeared a man from a puff of haze
He said, "What's up, Dane? My name is Hurb
I'm your fairy godfather, you know it, word!
Now I've came here with the main purpose
Of granting you your fondest wish"
I said, "Hurb, my man, just make me fresh
And I'm sure that I can handle all the rest"
With a snap of his fingers sparks began to shoot
And I was tough and on my body: a slick silk suit
On my feet there was argyle socks
And a fresh pair of Ballys from the Bally shop
I showed him my hat and don't you know
With a snap the hat became a Kangol
Once again his hands began to flow
Then he changed my skateboard into a Volvo
He checked me over, passed me the keys
And said, "One more thing before you leave...
You must return before the stroke of twelve
Or you'll turn back into your old self"

(Cinderfella Dana Dane!)
But I'm the rapper Dana Dane with fame
(Cinderfella Dana Dane!)
Yes, I'm the rapper Dana Dane with fame

I jumped in the Volvo, went on my way
I got to the party 'bout ten, I'd say
It was after eleven when I rocked the mic
And by the time I left the stage the people were hyped
The princess was staring in disbelief
Reflected from her eyes were my gold teeth
She waved her hands like 'Hello! Hi!'
Then gave another gesture like 'Come here, guy'
I left the stage, girls came in flocks
Fists were swingin' from the hard rocks
I heard a sound, not a tick nor tock
Gong! First bell before twelve o'clock
No time to waste, I broke out in haste
The princess followed in a futile chase
A quick steady pace is what I kept
Lost one of my Ballys on one of those steps
For the Volvo I continued my stride
About this time I heard gong five
I was down the block when I heard gong eight
And the princess scream out, "Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!"

(Cinderfella Dana Dane!)

And there went my suit, my Kangol and clothes

And there was no denyin' that my night was through
The one Bally shoe the freshest thing I sported

Made it to my pad, no time at all

Dana Dane To It
Dana Dane To It
Dana Dane To It
Dana Dane To It

[Verse 1]
Now here's a single with a jingle
That you all will be loving soon
You'll play it once and even have your parents croon
Hmm, it's a catchy tune
Hard as a monsoon
Maybe a typhoon
It's here to lift ya'
[?]
Those who oppose the Dane I have to dis ya'
Friends call me Savior, foes, a terror
But one and all knows that this is my era
So, all praise to Dane, no need for stalling
And don't be ashamed if you find yourself calling

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Now get a clasp
A grip, a grasp
You better hold on
Cause here's the [?] song
You'll soon be rolling on
Dane is in effect, uh huh, you figured that
This is my habitat
Where? Where the party's at
Hush it and just bump it, as if you dare to
The way I'm kicking it, I'm kind of rare, true
But what a flare, ooh, it's kind of catchy
Swung by a swinger and no one can match me
Face it
It's kind of basic
But on the smooth tip
You thought you had it, kid
That's kind of foolish
Now pull out your pen and pad and make a note of this
The rapper Dana Dane, oh yeah, that's who you're dealing with
So he's just the best, no need for stalling
And don't be ashamed if you find yourself calling

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
The party's pumped, pressed, packed to the rafters
This is my gospel, and I'm the pastor
Or the master
Clark here's my maestro
With your swiftness, show me how the scratch go
Well, good show mate
May I reiterate?
You're great
You're first rate
Back to my listeners
I hope you're liking this
The fine rhymes and lines that Dane's writing with
The way the lyrics land, I'm sure you understand
The mic was meant to remain in a masters hand
So here I am, Dane, to entertain
But take head and never say this name in vain

[Hook]

[Outro]
Ah, yeah.  I'd like to send some shout outs now
So, if I missed ya I didn't dis ya, I just forgot to list ya
And I'll catch you the next time around, you know how that goes
So, here we go, here we go, here we go
... a bunch of shout outs ...Next stop: Delancey Street
Step lively, and ah - watch the closing doors

[ VERSE 1 ]
I can't express it any plainer
That I'm a entertainer
People call me Dane, but my real name is Dana
I came here just to put you on
Cause I'm taking the rapping world by storm
In the rap I've made a change
A change that no other out there can claim
Now what I've done will make you laugh
So don't you ever be offended by the words I pass
I'll make you tickle, make your butt wiggle
You'll tell your friends, and they'll chuckle and giggle
Now this little story's called Delancey Street
It's the place where clothes are bought and people meet
Each city has a place that's quite the same
Even though it might go by a different name

Delancey Street
Delancey Stree-eet
Delancey Street
This story can't be beat

[ VERSE 2 ]
Well, I (um) went to Delancey Street to buy some wears
Even though I already had on fresh gear
Go into the store to buy a Kangol
I took out my wallet and my fat money roll
When three females walked up to me
There was a white, a black, the other Chinese
The white girl said, "My name is Dawn
And I love your gear by Louis Vuitton"
The black girl said, "My name is Jane"
And she couldn't keep her hands off the fresh gold chains
The Chinese girl, her name Suchi
She was foggin up the '86 Guccis
I thought they wanted to conversate
Then they all pulled out a six-shooter trey-eight
Three fresh females, who would have thought
Cause they tried to rob me, I almost got caught
I stood there for a minute, tried to concentrate
I tried to think of a way for me to escape
No one in sight, one thing to do
(You mean you ran, Dana Dane?) Damn right I flew
Up the block and through an alley
Yo, I cold dogged my fresh new Bally's
I ran through some water and some dog -
But I don't give a damn, I wouldn't be their vic'
Oh no, not me, not while I had feet
So then I dipped over to Orchard Street
Around the corner, past the brick house
And right in back of me, droolin from the mouth
Yes, them three females at hot pursuit
Then all of a sudden they began to shoot
I flundered, blundred, all the shots thundered
(Where did you run?) That's what I wondered
So confused, my head still in the wind
A sign up the street that read (dead end)

[ VERSE 3 ]
Now here they came, just as plain as day
Runnin down the street like _Three The Hard Way_
I approached the stop, the temper grew
And then the girl screams out: (Yo, damn it, don't move!)
They continued strong like the quiet storm
"Lover boy, run everything that you've got on"
"Run your Gucci, your Louis and your fresh gold chains
And your Bally shoes, we want it all from you"
Now max this move, what could I do?
Nowhere to run, no one to run to
The girls just didn't know who I am
But I knew a way to get out this jam
I stood in their face, took on the loud racket
Opened up my ??? jacket
Printed on my shirt, yes, there's bold and plain
'I'm not the one, the Rapper Dana Dane'
Well, the girls caught the message, it was plain to see
They might as well have said (Dana Dane, you're free)
Cause Jane came by, she winked her eye
And Dawn came over, grabbed me at my fly
And that's about the time when Suchi came near
She kissed me on my cheek and blew in my ear
Each one of them tryin to grab my hand
Screamin "Leave him!," to the other (Dana Dane's my man)
I knew it: they'd blew it
Punches were thrown, they got into it
They rumbled, battled, wrestled like cattle
"She made me do it!", they began to tattle
Swollen eyes and busted lips
Cause I think all of them got pistol-whipped
But I don't care, do you hear what I say?
I just wiped off my Bally's, went on my way
And they're still not friends till this very dayJohnny the Dipper, beware of your past
Johnny the Dipper, I think you're movin too fast

A baby boy was born, the mother died at birth
His father ran away, that made it even worse
Now he was passed along to his next akin
That was his mother's brother, known as Uncle Len'
He bought him a car of his very own
Got him an education and a decent home
But just when the lad became of age
Uncle Lenny thought he'd teach him his only trade
He said, "Johnny, my boy" - that was the laddie's name
"You're about to learn the pickpocket game
Now pay close attention, cause you gotta be quick
But most of all, be smooth and slick"
He studied his uncle for hours on in
And Lenny did the move for him again and again
Then one day Johnny screamed with glee
"I got it, I got it, see, Unc', see?"
"Now hold on," he said, "son, there's one more rule
Use your gift wisely, don't be no fool"
"Yeah, Unc', yeah," he said half-hearted
Little did Lenny know what he had just started
Cause now Johnny's dippin right and left
He did a year in the pen, two counts of theft

Yeah, they caught me this time
But wait till I get back out, man
No one will be able to touch me
Not even my uncle Lenny the Lifter
You understand what I'm sayin?
Yo, you know who I am?
I'm Johnny the Dipper!

Johnny the Dipper, beware of your past
Johnny the Dipper, I think you're movin too fast

Now Johnny the Dipper is the name he earned
Out on probation, and he still hasn't learned
Cause he's hawkin the walls of the high school halls
Schemin and scamin in the shopping mall
He skip, dip, take a wallet from the hip
Victims risky, but he was quick as a whip
Paid for days, his wallet gettin fatter
Johnny was the Dipper, nothin else mattered
Scoopin all them honeys, shit was great
Until he made his fatal mistake
He dipped on a man called Bobby Vino
Mafia king for the gambling casinos
Now Bobby was a hood who demanded respect
His pocket was picked and he was highly upset
He asked all his boys: now who would dare rob the
Undisputed king of the mobsters?
He sent Joe Crazy and [Name] Dan
Out on the mission to find their man

Yo, find Lenny the Lifter
And make him pay, eh?

He-he-he
Wait till my uncle sees my big pay-off
He's gonna be jealous, he-he-he

Johnny the Dipper, beware of your past
Johnny the Dipper, I think you're movin too fast

Now Johnny overjoyed with escapades
Went home to his uncle with the money he made
When he got home, well, the door wide open
A gun on the floor, the barrel still smokin
He stops, stares, his face full of fear
As he sees the results of his dipping career
Happy days it was to be, but no, instead
Lenny tied to a chair with a bullet in his head
He screams, "I'm sorry, I return every penny"
But Johnny, you've dipped one time too many

Oh Uncle..
Uncle Lenny!
What I have I done!
Uncle Lenny
Talk to me..

Johnny the Dipper, beware of your past
Johnny the Dipper, I think you're movin too fast[Intro]
Keep the groove so we can dance [x3]

Keep the groove so we can dance

[Verse 1]
Well I am here to show
And to let you know
How to get you party people out there on the go
See my potential is great
Soon I will own a estate
And drive a fresh Volvo with my name on the plate
Now with the rhymes I create
I guess it would be my fate
To be considered as the best at the present date
See I am only a man
Giving you what you demand
It's time to make you party people cold clap your hands
Cause I created this flow
To make go, "Ho"
And one more thing that I think you should know
I'm hear to entrance
Also enhance
Your feeling for the art of rap so you'd want to dance
The bass drum and snare
Vibrating through the air
Has been conceived to make your party spirits flair
The music line is smooth
And guaranteed to sooth
And it's moving at a speed that we call The Groove

[Chorus]
Keep the groove
Keep, Keep, Keep the groove
Keep the groove so we can dance
Dance
Dance

[Verse 2]
Now I walk
I don't be-bop
Here to make your finger pop
Soon enough I am bound to reach to very top
Call me King
Nah, that ain't my thing
I just hope you enjoy the rap songs I sing
But what I try to maintain
As said in my name
To be the rapper entertainer Dana Dane With Fame
I execute my rhyme
Moving oh so fine
And all you need do is listen to the line
Cause the rhymes are rough
Even call them tough
To hear them one time wouldn't be enough
Cause the words I say
Will make you sway
And for years to come this record will play
Cause the jam is hot
Sure to hit the spot
And to make you all groove is the only plot
So won't you bust a move
I'm sure that you will approve
And it's moving at a speed that we call The Groove

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Now be free at heart
Come on and do your part
I'm sure others will follow if you just start
I'm not hear to cause trouble
Or burst your bubble
I just want the party rocking right now on the double
Not trying to sound rude
Fierce or crude
Just trying to get your bodies into mood
Cause we create this thump
To make the house jump
And with he help of the scratch it's sure to pump
So won't you do like me
Let your body be free
And I'm sure in a moment you will agree
That in conclusion
It was amusin'
And also had your bodies groovin'

[Chorus x2][Hook]
Love at first sight
Is it forever or fly by night?
Love at first sight
Who's to say it's wrong or right?

[Repeat Hook]

[Intro]
Hello?  Yes, this is Dana.  Who's speaking?
Oh, Jackie!  How you doing?
It's been a long time hasn't it?
Nah, there'll be none of that babe
My plan leaves in about an hour
I don't think so
My tour starts when I get back
But, um... thanks for calling anyway
It's been nice knowing you, well it was nice knowing you
You take care of yourself
Oh, and don't give out my number
Thanks

[Verse 1]
Now I can still remember when we first met
It was one day that I'd would never forget
Six o'clock the approximate hour
Not really cloudy, expecting sun showers
I was taking a stroll halfway cross town
Then like expected the rain came down
I picked up my pace
For home base I raced
Ran into a soft object in my haste
On the ground we faced
Her in silk and lace
And with my eyes, her body I slowly cased
The pouring rain had drenched her dress
But I loved the way the cloth had clinged and caressed
"Excuse me", that was my first words spoke
Stood her up on her feet and gave her my trench coat
Somehow it happened while I covered her back
When her eyes and mine first made contact
The looks we gave changed the way we were
Now it was us and not me and her
Well, you wouldn't understand, well maybe you might
I guess you would call it love at first sight

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Now even the rain pour was easy to ignore
Only this young lady is what I saw
She was a sweet female, tender not frail
Other words beautiful, no need for details
I introduced myself, "Hi, my name is Dane
Can I get you out of this pouring rain?"
"Sure," she said.  "By the way, I'm Jackie."
Staring at me as I hailed down the taxi
We jumped in. The cab slowly moved off
She was holding my hand and it felt so soft
Now on my hear she gently chewed
And I knew it was more than just gratitude
I took it upon myself to take her to my house
I guess she didn't mind because her clothes were doused
Paid the cab his fee
Took out my house keys
Opened up the door, said "Enter please"
Took her to the bathroom, said "Hang your clothes on the line"
And gave her one of my shirts from Calvin Klein
Went to my room took off my wet wardrobe
I freshened up a bit and put on my silk robe
We met in the front near the roaring flames
Where we sat quietly sipping on champagne
Her eyes said "Thanks" beyond the use of words
And the crackling flame was all I heard
It felt as though we were on our honeymoon
As we moved from the front into the bedroom
We made passion love the night we met
And by the time we fell asleep there were no regrets
Well, you wouldn't understand, well maybe you might
I guess you would call it love at first sight

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
I woke up the next morning.  She was not there
Maybe she's fixing breakfast or doing her hair
I got out of my bed, threw on me house coat
When I noticed on the mirror she'd left a note
Saying, "Sorry Dane, I could not stay
Please meet me 1 o'clock where we met yesterday."
Well, I had time.  Two hours and a half
So I laid out my clothes and took a bath
I ate a good breakfast, had time to spare
So then I got dressed and I dally over there
I reached my destination not a cloud in sight
It was cool, kinda windy, but the sun was bright
Now I was on time, but she didn't show
And that was about twenty minutes ago
I stayed a little longer, about a half an hour
Felt a raindrop, maybe it's a sun shower
I was soon to see that my thoughts were wrong
Because the raindrop became an all-out storm
And there I was standing in the rain
And the lady that I looked for never came
Well, I was hurt and it showed in my face
As I tracked in the rain backed to my place
Slowly I walked hoping to bump into her
Me be in love? Nah, I barely knew her
I got home angry and depressed
And my Bally shoes were a total mess
But that was the last thing on my mind
As I sat on the couch staring into time
Well, I had her number and she had mine
But if she really wanted me she would have dropped me a line
But day after day and weeks went by
But she didn't call even to say, "Hi"
I would have called her first, but I've got my pride
"And I really don't care", to myself I lied
Now, there was no reason for me to be sad
Just remember that good time that we had
Cause I learned a little something that you should know
To keep some things you got to let them go
Well, you wouldn't understand, well maybe you might
I guess you would call it love at first sight

[Hook x2]

[Outro]
... Well it was nice knowing you
You take care of yourself
Oh, and don't give out my number
Thanks[ Dane ]
Hello, I'd like to see Dr. Slumber, please
[ doctor's assistant ]
Ah - do you have an appointment, sir?
[ Dane ]
No, I don't
But tell the Doctor it's urgent that I see her
[ doctor's assistant ]
Well - just one moment
Dr. Slumber?
Dr. Slumber, there's a young man out here named -
Excuse me, what is your name?
[ Dane ]
Oh, tell her it's Dana Dane
[ doctor's assistant (hysterically) ]
Hhhh... D-D-Dana D-D-DANE?!
OH NO!
OH, YOU CAN COME RIGHT IN!
COME RIGHT IN, RIGHT NOW!
COME ON IN...!
[ Dane ]
Thank you, thank you

Well, I walked into the office, what did I see?
A well-shaped body with the back to me
Sittin in her chair with an all-white gown
Said said (Dana Dane, won't you please lay down?)
She said that she wouldn't reveal her face
Till my hour was up and I was on my way
Now we got to the matter of why I came there
I said, "Doc, I keep havin these crazy nightmares"

Nightmares of the night (nightmares)
Nightmares, they're alright (nightmares)
Cause they just show imagination of reality (nightmares)
Just keep telling yourself that they're make-believe (nightmares)

She said, "Relax yourself, won't you tell me one
So I can diagnose and see what must be done"
I laid back my head, start to inhale
Caught my breath, and then I said, "Well -
Bright one morning I was late for class
Had a fresh pair of frames with Gucci on the glass
Girls they was hawking, dudes they was talkin
Saw the doggy-dogg female, I kept on walkin
She was on it hard, there was no denyin
Shoulda seen what this female was tryin
Grabbin on my shirt, tuggin on my slacks
Pullin on my zipper board, I had to hold her back
Word up, Doc, on the ultimate
Now if I never saw a creature, this girl was it
I kept on walkin, had to leave this place
But she was all up on me, breathin in my face
You may think I'm lyin though it's just a dream
This girl had the baddest breath I'd ever seen
I couldn't think straight, thought I was doomed
Heard a bling-bling-bling, it was time for homeroom
I stepped real quick, she tried to play it sassy
She almost ran me down, this nasty fatnastee
Dipped to the stairs, running blind
Get to my homeroom, ran through my mind
Got to the 4th floor, standin in the door
Girlies watchin me walk down the corridor
The guys they were jealous and gettin mad
And all the girlies wishin they had the class I had
Got to my classroom, expect to see the teacher
Who did I see? That ugly black creature
Paused for a minute standin in the door
Then I broke out when the girlie went raw
Word em up, Doc, couldn't stand the smell
Heard of 3D? Well, she was fat as hell
I ran out the school, I didn't look back
I tell you, Dr. Slumber, this girl was wack
And that's about the time when I awoke
And I smelled that awful breath that almost made me choke
Now tell me, Dr. Slumber, how can it be?
That this dream somehow became reality?
I can't go to sleep, cause I'm so damn scared
Cause I keep havin these crazy nightmares"

Nightmares of the night (nightmares)
Nightmares, they're alright (nightmares)
Cause they just show imagination of reality (nightmares)
Just keep telling yourself that they're make-believe (nightmares)
(Nightmares)

She said, "Listen, Dana Dane, I think I have the cure
But I have to hear one more before I'll be sure"
I laid back my head, tried to concentrate
Then I told her the nightmare 'bout the blind date
Had a blind date with this girl named Anita
The Fever's the place I'm supposed to meet her
Saw the def body with the vicious butt
How did I know she was a marvelous mutt
This lady I met was as ugly as hell
Couldn't go in the jam with this female
I was coughin hard, she started to braggin
Couldn't let them know I was here with this dragon
Grabbed her hand, dipped to Harlem World
But I left this ugly lady for another girl
Now this other female, her name was Denise
Couldn't get no rapture, there followed the beast
Everywhere I turn, everywhere I look
There was Anita the beast, she could not be shook
I dipped, I dived, I ran, I thrived
But there was no place that I could hide
Cause she was sniffin me out like a hungry blood hound
Her tail in the air, her nose to the ground
Only thing left for me to do
Was to set her up with this other dude
Now this other dude, he was real upset
Cause this ugly female he didn't wanna check
He started actin wild, even called me a faggot
What could I do, he had a .22 automatic
I dipped into the crowd, made my way to the door
Bumped into this object and I hit the floor
When I looked up, what did I see?
I saw Anita the Beast lookin down at me
I couldn't try to play it, couldn't try to pretend
Like the AFTCA I had to take the dog in

Nightmares of the night (nightmares)
Nightmares, they're alright (nightmares)
Cause they just show imagination of reality (nightmares)
Just keep telling yourself that they're make-believe (nightmares)
(Nightmares)

Now I pleaded, "Dr. Slumber, I just can't bare
To have another one of these crazy nightmares"
Then all of a sudden she turned around
And starin at me with that all-white gown
With a Catholic smile, showin all her teeth
Was that ugly female, Anita the Beast...

[ Dr. Slumber, her sweet, soft voice turning horrifying ]
Dana?
Dana, honey, wake up!
What's wrong?
Wake up, honey
You are just... HAVING A NIGHTMARE!
A-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
A-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha![Verse 1]
Fuck what you heard, act like you know
For the ninth time Dana Dane serves a funky flow
Oh you didn't know that I was down with the Lifestyles?
Battlecat, we flip this, he makes the track that's buck wild
People wonder where I've been, what I'm going to do now
Well I've been north and south creating a new sound
Thought I couldn't do it, huh?  Make another single?
After "Dane With Fame" you thought the Dana Dane was done
Because they say you're only as good as your last
The Diggy coming through with something new on your funky ass
Yeah, see I've been missing in action
Gone, but not forgotten
'95 Diggy Dane's go you rockin'
And you know there'll be no stopping
I got to keep the fellas hyped
And keep the honies panties dropping (oh drop those drawers honey)
With the funky hits that I'm bringing
You know I'm going to win cause once again I got y'all singing

[Verse 2]
I can't sleep because (the nightmares) keep messing with my head
I couldn't top my last smash hit, that's what the critics said
About the capital D-a-n-a capital D-a-n-e
I ain't worried about it though Cause I know I got more hits in me (that's real)
So, where do we go from here? That's what I ask myself
Sold five hundred thousand copies from the store shelf (I'm gold)
But a whack contract
Tried to hold be back
And bring me down
But you know there'll be none of that
I got to make it happen
I'm aiming for platinum
Sitting back and rolling up a fat one
Everybody spreading rumors, but I'll get the last laugh
'85 to '95 Dane still signing autographs
So suckers [?] one in your mouth
You never thought it came from Brooklyn
We cooking up the flavors of the Lifestyles
Old jams linger and persist and keep hanging
Yeah, once again I got you singing

[Verse 3]
Y'all remember how I kicked it
I ripped it
Gifted lyrics flowed like liquid
(Uh huh, Uh huh)
But now it's time I flipped it
And shifted
To that other level of the game
Yes it's me Dana Dane (Fame)
Once again on the cut
Here to fuck it up
Fort Greene Projects Brooklyn
Off the [?] [?] [?]
I'd like give shouts to
[???]
I had to bust a power move that tapes in LA
Made a plane with my man
Harry O, Little K
Yo, we hooked up and now I'm down with that clique
All the non-believers sick
Your honies riding disnick
Of the Dana (scrath) Dana
The Entertainer
The Gucci Tamer
I can't express it any plainer
For too long I had ya'll waiting and fiending
So I hit you once again fat and hard to keep you screaming[Godfather]
Come get on the HOOOOOOOE Train!
Pimpin ain't easy
Pimps up
Hoes down

[Slick Rick]
Well I'm a pimp y'all, out here protecting
1972, 42nd, mad (?), lot of cops gather
Cause my pink Rolls-Royce known to stop traffic
At the curb, looking close to regal
My hoes, pure dimes, now approach the vehicle
What you call this?  Quite appalled with
"Must've been a slow night," 20 grand, that's all bitch?
Took the cash and just about to dally
When Peaches, beat down, ran from out an alley
Delayed, more beef now placed upon a player
300 pound pervert don't wanna pay her
Pimp my hoes, strolling, I don't like that
Hold my pink fur derby, I'll be right back

[Slick Rick and Dana Dane]
Dana Dane, Slick Rick, lords of wrecking
We the biggest pimps from Hunt's Point to 42nd

[Godfather]
Man, Pimpin ain't Easy

[Slick Rick]
18 hour day, money getting racked up
Even if we got to Krazy Glue a chick, ooh she back up

[Dana Dane]
You can squeeze it, hoes pick my doo doo when they sniff it
Juice is Breakfast at Tiffany's terrific
My baby blue Eldorado coupe is just the sickest
My stable boast the most exotic bitches (come here ho)
A make a quarter roll of hoes bubble like Cristal
3 grand a night each, three ways I fish out
Hoes better have my scratch
Word to Slick Rick's diamond covered eye patch
I scoop my cash out the air, white lineyed out
Out comes a dime, red dress, bottom shimmeyed out
Askin if I'm the great one, like there's any doubt
She want to split her gorilla pimp Jimmy house
I spit iceberg cold, and plenty pound
Run, your funny soft stories they don't get me roused
You wanna ride in the train?  Put some (?) out
Here's a quiz, baby girl, are you in or out? (I'm in!)

[Slick Rick and Dana Dane]
Dana Dane, Slick Rick, lords of wrecking
We the biggest pimps from Hunt's Point to 42nd

[Godfather]

[Slick Rick]
Check it, 18 hour day, money getting racked up
Even if we got to Krazy Glue a chick, ooh she back up

Well rest from sleep my test to (?) each
Port Authority trying to scoop fresh, not (?)
Now hoping, I'm the only one that's open
This bright hot shorty with ponytail approaching
So I move in on her hot drawers
I'm like hey baby, my name's Sweet Daddy, what's yours?
I spun a 360, impose on
Now she in the palace alone with no clothes on
And my flagpole blazing in the trimmer
Say about 2, 3 days of this dilemma
Now got lots to do, say to the prostitute
"You love me?  Prove to Sweet Daddy how much you do"
Now noticing the chick look puzzled
Till I dialed her up like she was a Heidy Fleiss model
High heels, make up, then I inspect the chick
And fling her outside to suck a Wallstreet executive

[Slick Rick and Dana Dane]
Dana Dane, Slick Rick, lords of wrecking
We the biggest pimps from Hunt's Point to 42nd
When it comes to (uhh) we the Captain Kirks of

Never gonna let you fade away, away
Dana Dane
Never gonna let you fade away, away
Dana...

[ INTRO ]
Full-circle, 360 degrees Dane
My style will live forever, my fame will be maintained
Now some can't feel this, and some feel can't that
But all can feel a track that's produced by Battlecat
So gather round and listen to my non-fiction
The picture will come clearer than a Sony television
This ain't about dissin, this is all fact
Women on my nuts cause my vocals makin cash

[ Hook ]
(The Rapper Dana Dane, what time is it?)
She's on the record's jock, she doesn't love me
(The Great Dana Dane, what time is it?)
She's just stressin my fame and my money

[ VERSE 1 ]
I'm bustin this one for Bridget, the ho
I met at the Emmaco pumpin the petrol into her five point o
I wanted her because she looked like Janet Jackson
Caramel complexion, sportin sexy fashion
"Hello, how you're doin?" I said, "they call me Dane"
"I could learn to love your flavor, hon, hey, what's your name?"
She had nothin for me, totally ignored me
High-sided, took it like she never saw me - cool
So I tried again: "What up! How you're feelin?"
Was a hot and humid day, but I felt a cold chill
I figured, let me step before I have to diss her
That's when I overheard her girlfriend try to whisper
(Oh, I know him from somehwere - oh, that's Dana Dane!
I saw him last week, he performed on _Soul Train_)
Now honey flipped the script like Sybill
"You're not the Rapper Dana Dane with fame, is you?
Ooh, I like your records, ooh, you're the man
Ooh, you're so fine, I'm your number one fan"
Now she knows that I'm the Dane, all of a sudden I'm accepted
Ridin on my nuts cause I'm pumpin out hit records

[ Hook ]

[ VERSE 2 ]
Next I peeped this honey at the bar scopin the Dane hard
Loud, money proud, yo, I knew her ho card
Native New Yorker, Brooklyn fast-talker
Big jewelry-sporter, sippin Johnny Walker
She bought me this drink, she's flashin her cash
She passin me hints like she wanna give me the ass
I avoided her because I knew her man Pedro
She said (Dana, fuck him, let's talk about your stage show!)
You ??? well, there ain't no brother brother
Hands on my pants, woulda yoked it if I let her
She was gettin tippsy, dancin like a gypsy
Seen her before, but never knew she was this frisky
Tried to break lips, but she wasn't tryin to have it
Playin me close like ??? metal to a magnet
Then she shouted: "Dane, I can't wait to get you naked!"
Ridin on my nuts cause I'm pumpin out hit records

[ Hook ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
Now last but not least, let me tell you 'bout Judy
Baaya with the tattas, booya with the booty
A cutie with a juicy fat coochie
Felt it was my duty to make her sing like Suzy
??? 'Cha-ya-ya-ya...' - recall the flavor?
From the first album that the Dane ever gave ya
Anyway, no more delay, she was a hard nut to crack
Kicked the rap like a mack, but she wouldn't give me jack
But still she's in my grill every time that she sees me
Askin (When you're comin with that new fat release?)
Well, I seen her 'bout a weak about, I told her 'bout a week or so
"Wouldn't you like to be in Dana Dane's video?"
Now she started clickin, dissed her in addition
Comin to my crib for the private audition
Again the same game, just a different scenario
Ridin on my nuts to play a part in my video
Must be the music
That's makin her flip
Must be the music
Must be the music

[ Hook ][Verse 1]
The sounds you're about the hear coming through your speaker
Will blow you over and fry your tweeter
Get up out your seat
Give your feet a treat
And you'll understand why this be the def beat

[Interlude with talking]

[Verse 2]
Listen up patriarchs of the rapping sphere
The rapper entertainer Dana Dane is here
Now I came here just to have fun
So guys get loose and girls shake those buns
A lot of you girls what I would love to meet
And I'll check you later when my job's complete
Cause as for now I am only around
To make you party people just get on down
Cause the rhymes I write
Are fresh and ripe
And guaranteed to be just your type
Cause you the public knows who we're rhyming for
And for my rhymes I'd like than you all
Cause I've worked hard for days and nights
Just to make sure the rhymes came out right
Now that I did, you must admit
That the rhymes I wrote were the ultimate
But nevertheless I'd like to exclaim
"This Be The Def Beat" is this jam's name
Now do me a favor for me and my team
When I say "scream" would you please scream?
Scream!
(Crowed screams)
Yes, something like that, yes, yes

[Interlude with talking]

[Verse 3]
The beat is bad, getting badder
On the way up the ladder
"The Beat Is Dope" is the neighborhood chatter
You might think the record would be hard core
But I'm here to tell you it's much much more
A combination of rap, rhythm and blues
And a swinging beat that you can't refuse
Some call it slick, others say it's jammin
Clark heard the beat and said, "Yo, it's slammin!"
Crashing through your speakers like a wild stampede
With enough base to make your eardrums bleed
And just when you thought it's just a beat
The music line come in for a extra treat
It [?] on point smooth but also crisp
The producer Hurby just has that gift
Now on the microphone a voice that you can trust
Yes me, Dane, kicking it from dawn to dusk
Simply conveyed
Are the words I say
Don't ask me why, I just rhyme that way
But let's get back to the rhythm at hand
"This Be The Def Beat" is the name of this jam

[Outro with talking][Intro]
Dane: Hey yo, Hurb what's up?
Hurby: Dana, where you been?
Dane: Yo, the limo came late man.  I just stepped in
Hurby: Well, let's start the show.  The peoples getting upset.  Tell them what this be
Dane: Okay, Hurb, bet

[Verse 1: Dane Dane with Hurby Luv Bug]
Let this be the reason for all mankind
You're taste buds will just love a well seasoned rhyme
That I recite on the mic
Making you get hyper
Than (You've ever been)
Cause I'm Dane.  I'm on the mic again
Rapping up a storm (Oh, come on)
Yo, Hurb! (Huh?)
Tell them what what's going on

[Switch: Hurby Luv Bug with Dana Dane]
Now what we have here's
The best jam of the year
Top security for your assurity
I swear
Me and Dana is maxin hard
(Cold chilling)
If you want to flirt, flygirls
(We're willing)
Who, me?  I'm Hurby Luv Bug, word see
I've been rapping for years
But no one's heard me rhyme
Because I spend most of my time
Producing other groups, but now I'm going for mine

[Switch: Hurby Luv Bug with Dana Dane]
Now you'll dance (You'll glide)
You'll move with pride
And you don't stop moving even though you try
You won't (you can't)
You'll huff (and pant)
And "we want more" (Will be your chant)
So you wait, you hope
Wide eyed, you scope
Praying for another rhyme that's just as dope
But you're tired (waxed)
But here is the facts
Just like sex you want your climax
As sure as I'm Dana Dane With Fame
When it comes you'll know it came
Cause a sigh of satisfaction will be exhaled
And all at once you all will yell

[Hook]
Dana: "We want to party, we want to party!"
Crowd: "We want to party, we want to party!"
Dana: "I said, we want to party, we want to party!"
Crowd: "We want to party, we want to party!"

Aaaaaah, yeah
Haha
That's right.  Get down
So let's party

[Verse 2: Hurby Luv Bug with Dana Dane]
Yes, we're going to party if you like it or not
I don't care if you're tired or burning hot
Dana Dane and I came here to drop
(Dope, def) [?] rhymes on the spot
(In effect)
You can bet
Two great poets
And my man, Clark Kent on the D.J. set

[Switch: Dane Dane with Hurby Luv Bug]
Yes, we're going to party Until you're out of breath
And the drum seems like it's going to beat you to death
Have you scream and holler throughout the show
(Yo, are we going to party?)
Now Hurb, you know
We'll make them dance until their legs get weak
But they'll still refuse to go grab a seat
"Party Hard" (G)
And that we will
But there'll be no reason for you to get ill
Cold drink at the bar
Sounds up to par
And for your entertainment, we are your stars
Now I'd like to send out a call
And I want a little feedback from you all

[Hook]
Dana: "Say, we want to party, we want to party!"
Crowd: "We want to party, we want to party!"
Dana: "I said, we want to party, we want to party!"
Crowd: "We want to party, we want to party!"

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh, Baby, please
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it to me like that
(do it, do it)
Let's party

Let's party
Yo, the party's at our hotel girls
That's right and I got the lambskins, so trust me
Cases of em
Ah, yes.  Ah, yes.  We are ready for tonight
But if you're coming with your boyfriends, we suggest you don't
That's right, leave your man home
This is a girls party
[fades out ... inaudible]
