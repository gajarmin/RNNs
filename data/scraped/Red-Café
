[Hook: French Montana]
I see you niggas from the side watchin'
Got a hundred grand in my side pocket
All the hustlers love it, you know I speak the lingo
Tell a bitch give me head, Ocho Cinco
Ocho Cinco
Ocho Cinco
Told that bitch give me head, Ocho Cinco
Ocho Cinco
Ocho Cinco
Told that bitch give me head, Ocho Cinco

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Face down, ass up
Pull up in that spaceship with that top down
Bitch pass out, chain light up, they blackout
I'm like "haaanh," Ocho Cinco, that's a head-banger
I see a bitch lookin' thirsty, told her go and drink up
I head hunt, that new nigga, and what
Shorty got that ocho, good head, and butt I'm like "haaanh"
All I got for bitches is pipe water
I done came up off a night order

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Bitch gave me head till my legs shake (burrr)
She gave me the brain, but that doesn't explain
Why these lames be lovin' and cuffin' these bitches
I don't know shit about 'em but they head shape
Fuck that pussy 'til her legs break
Bustin', got a dirty dozen of them brown things
Waitin' in a room like an egg crate, uhh
B-A-D boy ho
And I got B-A-D bitches for my boys so
Treat 'em like pollo, serve 'em, black Suburban
Swervin' through the hood, gettin' head like turbans
Any job a good job, so she got a blowjob
Suckin' it from nine to five, that bitch workin'
Kells

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Los]
Man I say pimps up, hoes down
I say that to say that I only recognize these bitches
With they limbs up, or from the nose down
I tell her nose dive, then watch 'em go down
Bitch I'm cold as ice water
Put dick way down your throat until your eyes water
Lemme get that for you, lil mama cause you workin'
The way you twerkin', you gon' fuck around and get a Birkin
She like to crack the dutch down the middle, drop a purp in
Let me fuck her in the telly, screaming open up the curtains like
(Don't stop! Pop that, pop that!)
You know French cut, she got on French cuts
I don't French kiss, I let my friends cut
Me and Red in an all red Benz truck

[Verse 4: Red Cafe]
I told French, I told Los, I get good head while I'm chauffeured
Momma told me, "get a nice girl with a good head on her shoulders"
Shake down, shake down, came up on them back blocks
Her face on my belt buckle, that's what I call laptop
Side niggas from the side watchin', guess they got a side view
Puff got me in this penthouse, that's my view
That's my crew, they shinin'
She only came so she could come, boss
And her first choice was the number one boss

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Diddy]
Yo bitch, I'm a motherfuckin' livin' legend
I'm 'bout to send these niggas through they fifth depression
In my absence niggas speaking silly
I could stand on the mountains and the streets'll feel me
Feel the rush and that Bad Boy
OBG that OG, don't OD cause that's bad boy
She feel royal when she 'round this
King Combs, now give me crown, bitch[Intro: Red Cafe]

Got a feeling your finna be my best ever
You making me proud, you're making me proud
You know I'm finna put work in that pretty old thing
So I'm blowing this loud

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
She telling me I need to change
But baby I need the change
2 coupes, 2 bricks, life's too short
Cocktail, 2 Glocks and a Newport
I put my money where my mouth is
Number one anywhere the south is
Rich niggas, you can tell by the outfits
High tops, Versace, I'm on that boss shit
Count cash on the tarmac
For you new niggas gotta run the car fax
VIN numbers that don't match
She telling me this money won't last

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook] x2

[Verse 3: Red Cafe]
Girl you got all these stalkers
You woke up like that huh, flawless
Breaking all the rules, you living lawless

All I wanna do is make your overnight's better, wetter

[Hook: Red Cafe]

[Verse 5: Fabolous]
I say money over hoes, I like to broaden everything

Let her rock the mic, she like recording everything
Tongue out, legs open, Michael Jordan everything!
I be washing niggas up, they say I'm bathin everything

Green strip, red strip, green strip nigga

[Hook: Red Cafe][Verse 1 - Jermaine Dupri]
(J.D. you need to stop!)
You know what this need (this need me)
You know what this need (this need me)
Uh, I drop this in the club when I be DJ'n
From left to right, everybody start swaying
I be, I be seeing girls tapping niggas on the shoulder, saying
"Teach me how to dougie, teach me, teach me how to dougie"
Then I pull it back, start it from the top, and all the bitches love me
I'm the 24-hour stunner roadrunner nigga, can't catch me
Get green like Bill Bexby, damn I mean Bixby
Stay in the 6-speed, my corner in the club is where the fucking chicks be
And the flicks be, popping like the red carpet
That California swag with a little college-park shit
Fat ass, small waist, lil' Cali-Park chick
Came up to me, came-came up to me and said
"Teach me how to dougie, teach me, teach me how to dougie"
If you really wanna know, then girl you gotta go to D-Town
"Teach me how to dougie, teach me, teach me how to dougie"
But until then shawty, check me, check me out now

[Hook - Smoove]
Everybody love me
Every-everybody love me
Everybody love me
You ain't messing with my dougie

[Verse 2 - Smoove]
(Remix!)
They be like "Smoove, you know you gotta rip on the remix"
I'm telling these guards, "better work on your defense"
I'm Kobe in the clutch, you other niggas suck
And I'm no B. Jennings, getting Milwaukee Bucks!
What's the deal? I'm fresh like dougie and I keep getting pussy
Cause all my bitches love me
And my swag bring em' in nigga not my money
It ain't tricking if you got it but I am no dummy

[Verse 3 - B.o.B]
Ay, they be like B.o.B, (What?) "how you do that in Atlanta?" (Yes)
She said she like my dougie now she jigging off my grammar
Well basically she got it down and dirty like Dianna
I got the Cali puff, you can't find that in Atlanta
I hit her with that flex till she getting preg
You heard what I said, hit her with a test, then she know what's next
I teach ya how to dougie, teach ya how to swag walk
I ain't talking about that swag that come in a plastic bag (Oh no)
This is ain't a infomercial, this does not come with a tag
I'll take the game, beat it up, and leave it on this bag
B.o.B. up on this track, in a Jason mask, so I'm finna hack
Everything in sight, nothing's left in tact
I'm, stuck to the seat with no seat-belt
Don't worry about me cause I don't need help
Ride around down A-Town up 85 with a phone on my hip

[Hook - Smoove]
Everybody love me
Every-everybody love me
Everybody love me
You ain't messing with my dougie

[Verse 4 - JayAre]
Had to remix it, cause I didn't mention

007 boys, we be on missions
He gonna teach 'em how to dougie
I'mma make 'em do the dishes
Fuck these niggas, my palm itches
I get money, do good business
Teach em' how to dougie, God as my witness
Everybody dancing, and everybody listen (Ay!)

[Verse 5 - Red Cafe]
(6 minutes)
My dougie so fresh, I keep a bunch of fly misses
They all let me cut, no butterfly stitches
Fresher than Febreze, in the major league
Yes I'm the shit, though I do attract fleas
Everyday I pop tags, I'm a fly motherfucker
I don't even drive, I'm so fly motherfucker
Big ole ass, body like Serena
Make it, make it go back and forth, is your name Aaliyah now

[Hook - Smoove]
Everybody love me
Every-everybody love me
Everybody love me
You ain't messing with my dougie

[Verse 6 - Yung]
Okay, my swagger on flight, my dougie so fresh
Kill it dancing, now I'm on like wings on a jet
Shucks, we brought it to the hood, like a brand new set
Cali what I rep got the game by the neck
Something like a necklace, shout-out to Dallas, Texas
They taught me this dance, now these hoes cooking me breakfast
D-Town boogie, with a little Cali spin
Remix on the track, you know we had to get it in

[Verse 7 - Bow Wow]
Mr. Murk-A-Verse, killa remixes
Young Bow Wizzle with that Cali Swag District
Backpack on, snap-back on
Modern day LL, girls can't leave him alone
Phantom two-tone, money too grown
If I stood on my wallet, I'd be 8 feet tall
Stelly Phel turn it up, I'm about to burn it up
Smoking on that Cali good got a nigga high as fuck
(What it is!)[Intro: Red Cafe]
The stock done went up
I see you baby
You know I fucks with that, why not?
Shake down

[Hook: Red Cafe]
Pretty gang, that girl from the pretty gang
I'm a street nigga from the hood
And I only fuck with girls from the pretty gang
Pretty gang, that girl from the pretty gang
I'm a real nigga from the hood
But I only fuck with girls from the pretty gang

[Verse 1: Red Cafe]
She a bad girl from the ghetto
I'm a hood nigga only sip XO
If I ain't off the kush and the Rosé
Laid up fuckin' on the cougar bitch next door
Pretty gang all about that rep that
Throw your flag up, lame hoes hate you
When them broke ass niggas come around finna be in yo' face make sure them niggas pay you
My shawty got ten Louis bags, tory burch, Channel and YSL
She ain't worried 'bout nothin', cause her team fly as hell
I'm here with my niggas, and we gon' spend this money
Party like it's yo' birthday, hit the telly then we get gully

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Red Cafe]
That Dominican girl
East African queen, call you my cinnamon girl
Sweet like grandma cobbler, look at that girl posture
Ever think about fuckin' with a mobster?
Everyday in designer
Real niggas tryna get behind her
Got a tattoo on her back, it say "made in vagina"
Dope boys, ball players, fuck she gots to talk that
What your bank account looking like lately
Lame niggas gon' walk it out
Heard the pretty gang deep for a fitness ho
Rich niggas finna ball out

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Now if you pretty gang then rep your sets
All them stares, they ain't stepped up yet
She kept it hard and she kept that wet
So she ain't missed a Giuseppe yet
Money talks and ain't get strep throat yet
Champagne til' I sweat Moët
Big ol' booty that stretch them sweats
Look back at it, retrospect
Gotta have it
Every time a nigga see it a nigga wanna grab it
Can't be with a boss if you ain't established
Can't join pretty gang if you ain't a bad bitch (bad bitch, bad bitch)

[Hook][Chorus: Problem]
Aye, aye bitch, try this
Guaranteed to turn a square to a bi bitch
You ain't down, b-b-bye bitch
I ain't got time for playing, I'm just saying man
We out here trying to function, man we out here trying to function
We out here trying to function, man we out here trying to function
We out here trying to function, man we out here trying to function
I ain't got time for playing, I'm just saying man
We out here trying to function, man we out here trying to function
We out here trying to function, man we out here trying to function
We out here trying to function, man we out here trying to function
I ain't got time for playing, I'm just saying man
We out here trying to function

[Verse 1: E-40]
I slid into the function (the throw)
Looking hella dipped (saucy)
Lit like a strobe light (like a strobe light?)
Hella diamonds on my wrist (bling!)
You can call me your highness cause I'm hella high in this
Play with their mind like a shrink like I’m a psychiatrist
No dryness, I make your chick hella climax, scream
Even nicer wet, she telling me that I'm the best
You don’t want her, I’ll take her off your hands and do you a favour
You might not regret it now but you gon'a regret it later
I'm about my paper, stapler right on the side of my hip
In case a hater want it, in case he decide to trip
Platinum planning, shipping and handling, see these are digital sales
Used to push E up from the scale but now it's legitimate skrill
You ain't understand it, that this game evolved from the heels
Vallejo Cali RB the H-I double L’s

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
Don’t compare me to niggas, I'm the last of my kind
Get forever through these bars, ever lasting my grind
If it ain't about money, then you wasting my time
Mix the molly with the liquor now get out of your mind
Gotta do is one for the town, it’s town business
I don’t even fuck with these clowns, the clown niggas
In the city where the dealers go broke they turn killers
And all the bad bitches got all the hoes they like niggas
In the city where we gonna do broke, we like figures
Get that bag then we going to work like Jay Bilas
We out here tryna function, tryna maintain
They said to don’t judge me, told the judge the same thang
So guess who is up in the club with the four nickel
Man I stay on the point like icicle
If I die tonight bring me back at the Coachella
Sick and tired of killing these hoes, I'm that nigga

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Look, got bad bitches, they ratchet
Bet the ding make them sing like an ad-lib
And all this money watch me flip it like a back flip
I'mma go to work on a pussy no practice
Ha, I'm a real niggas in the photo
Bottles in the air, we don’t care about no ho, no ho
Yeah, shout out my nigga dilo
Girl I know you want to but I need about 3-4
Yeah, pretty girls in the crib
I know they all models, that’s just how a nigga live
I'm like whoa, when she do the splits
And when she throw it back nigga don’t act like a bitch!
My niggas in the club with the 40
We just showed up with E-40, we like what’s happening woadie?
In the function ain't a competition, killing opponents
And I be killing the pussy but this is just for the moment, yikes

[Hook]

[Verse 4: French Montana]
Rocking the roller, 'til 5 in the morning
She popping the pill, then she busting it open
Like bitch try this, I'm a high risk
A bank roll, 4-5-6
She chasing the act, with a clip in the mac
For my Oakland niggas that be pimping the rap
I'm a New York nigga with a bailey
Kept it in the hood, fuck the mainstream
Wrist rocky, I'm talking Adrian
Me and 40 run opponent like the A train
Man we out here tryna function, fuck all the fuck shit
Rip it off the rack, fuck what it cost ya, Montana

[Chorus]

[Verse 5: Red Cafe]
Real nigga from born day
42 10 hoes to your soirée
Whole team in this hole looking saucy
Bitches off the molly, my niggas on the Marley
Hold up, we out here tryna function bitch
All this jewellery a nigga got from hustling bitch
Got them thank pass coming through custom bitch
See the money on the table no touching it, what else?
Cafe, I'm the pimp of the decade, yeah
Young g’s write about me in they essay
Kill Def Jams, in my Cool-Js
Have my paper or they mopping up your cule
I like Yokos, them live hoes
Beat it up, beat it up, make em my hoes
It’s bossed up on the east side
Dubs up, that's how them G’s rock, shakedown

[Chorus][Ryan Leslie:]
So when I fly, you fly, we fly together
And when I shine, you shine we shine forever

[Red Cafe:]
I'm a boss so I need a boss chick
And we can boss up like the bosses
All about green like Paul Pierce
Mayweather flow, look, zero losses
Dime in the day, diamond at night
Five star chick 'bout that five star life
I must admit I'm a fan
Your shoe game ruthless, girl, god damn
Been a few years you're my number 1
Blood in my veins, breath in my lungs
We the ones winning so they want toast
We a item, blend like Rum Coke
Love the way you're doing it, keep doing it now
Fly like a jet blue stewardess
You can fly alone but I don't advise it
I'm inviting you to fly with the pilot

[Ryan Leslie:]
So when I fly you fly we fly together
And when I shine you shine we shine forever baby
So when I fly you fly we fly together
And when I shine you shine we shine forever oh yeah

[Rick Ross:]
She wanna hit me on the iChat
On the iPad, flying in the sky caps
Shawty got a nice job but works too hard
Put that shit... now welcome to the mall
I need my women mogul, I make the picture mogul
Double MG is global , still ride or role for dolo
I ain't rocking no polo but I'm...
Her heart beating so fast cause I'm taking my time
Yeah I get it and lick it, I just handle my business
School of the VS1's, national or not difference
And my Bentley just dippin', I keep her by my side
My life a runway, and it's time to fly

[Ryan Leslie:]
So when I fly you fly we fly together
And when I shine you shine we shine forever baby
So when I fly you fly we fly together
And when I shine you shine we shine forever oh yeah

[Verse 3: Red Cafe]
Yeah! Yeah! I’m a boss so I need a boss chick (HA!)

Feet kicked up corner office (Yeah!)
Royalty princess in my crosses
She wanna tear the mall down well I let her do
Hear go my credit cards (Yep!) And the debit too (Yep!)
I like your attitude (Ha!) Guess I’m supposed to
See you on Facebook (What’s up?) So I post you (What Else?!)

Me and my boo, you know how I do
Toss keys to valet on arrival

Any time you fall through it’s a blood bath
Swag killin’ them hoes now leave your autograph[Intro]
{*HBO TV logo sound*}
Ladies and gentlemen
Captain Al Thompson has turned off the no smoking sign
And you are free to smoke at this time
Please refrain from smoking in the aisles, the lavatories
And the non-smoking areas of this cabin

[Chorus]
I was sitting up above the clouds
Then one day you just came soaring by
Then my life just took a sudden turn
It's hard to swallow but you live and learn
I was sitting up above the clouds
Then one day you just came soaring by

[Verse 1]
Yeah, let me breathe on it
Light it up 'til we hit the roof
'Till that coconut Ciroc got 'em gettin loose
We above 'em all, now they want call a truce
But I'm quarterbackin, busy callin audibles
Cruisin through the finish line
I'm still eatin dinner baby I ain't finished mine
E'rybody want the throne, y'all get in line
I'm comfortable, I got a dime and I got a nine
Whassup? I'm sittin way above the clouds
Like I'm on the stage, and I'm above the crowd
Preach capital game in the microphone
Finna to tell these halfway crooks leave the mic alone
Nigguh.. Y'all killin the feeling
Got a nigga ready to go back, killin and dealin
Meanwhile I'm still lettin the kush burn

[Chorus]

[Red Cafe during Chorus]
And I've been doin this for a long time
My grind strong
Puttin that work in, as you should
So while I'm sittin on this cloud lighting up
Breathe, bitch

[Verse 2]
Everybody judgin me, I guess it's a contest
Yeah, and I see the victory right in front of me
I turn back and trip 'em with no conscience
I know, no class, no sportsmanship
With that attitude I see no fortune, shit
But ask me if I give a fuck
I'm still winnin and they callin it beginner's luck
Ridin around in a bulletproof tinted truck
I know they got love but shit, they might hit it up
Yeah, just to get a name, just to get the fame
But all the hoes screamin they just wanna get Jermaine
They know I got it and I spent it
I get money every day, ain't none of this rented, ahh
I gotta get it, gotta finish the herb

[Chorus]

[Red Cafe during Chorus]
I mean I feel like we on a victory lap
Celebration is definitely in order
All my G's light up
Ladies Imma pop these bottles and um

[Outro]
We gon' drink away the pain, believe that
I mean it's a beautiful day, huh
We above the clouds
I'm lookin down on more than a nigga girl, ha ha
Ahhh, yeah don't mind me

Nigga taught me that grease, believe that
Like I was sayin this a celebration
Ladies and gentlemen, niggas and bitches
Pimps and hoes, we gon' get right to it
This is Red Cafe, reportin to you live
Shakedown[Verse 1: Red Cafe]
Now you know I got patience
Be my night nurse; I'm the patient
I just need a little medication
If you makin' juice, I won't waste it; I mean that
Kick back, open up the sunroof
Feel the cool breeze; mic check, one, two
Oh lord, finna drink away the pain
I'm high and I need to be entertained
You fuckin' with a winner, I ain't with the game
No traffic; I'm in my own lane
Shake down dirty red queen, lord..

[Hook: Lorde (sample)]
We both got a million bad habits to kick
Not sleeping is one
We're biting our nails, you're biting my lip
I'm biting my tongue
We both got a million bad habits to kick
Not sleeping is one
We're biting our nails, you're biting my lip
I'm biting my tongue
But people are talking, people are talking
But people are talking, people are talking

[Verse 2: Red Cafe]
They know I got a short fuse
Stay strapped, top gun, Tom Cruise
Ten chicks in the car, that's a car pool
Left Bad Boy, I'm doin' what I want to
Roll one, smoke one, if you want
I'mma put you niggas on what I'm on to
New shit, watch this, fly shit
High life, toxic, my shit
Team winnin', no use for the cheat code
I'm a G, law to the G code
Fired up, take a ride up
Let them chicks know I got stacks for the freak show
How a champion's supposed to look
Check the numbers; ya'll could check the books
Floridian girl; California dreams; New York hustle
I live to hustle, lord..

[Hook/Outro: Lorde (sample)]
We both got a million bad habits to kick
Not sleeping is one
We're biting our nails, you're biting my lip

Money ain't a thing it never been a thing
So I wipe my ass with hundred dollars bills
Told y'all niggas I'm the hottest in the hood

Gotta gets the cash, I gotta gets the dough (Remix!))

I gotta gets the cash, I gotta gets the dough UH! (Juganot baby!)
I gotta get it, got, gots to get it come on!!! (Joell hit 'em!!!)

[Verse One: Joell Ortiz] (Juganot)
Pennies, nickels and dimes and quarters, dollars and fives
And, tens, twenties, fifties and hundreds gotta be mine
I'm a product of poverty I would like to be fine
One day no Honda, Maserati reclined
No mice in the trap no roaches in the kitchen
People the size of me on their latest televiison (UH!)
Lounge downstairs full bar nice women (Uh Huh!)
And somethin out back in case shorty like swimmin
YEAH!!!

[Verse Two: Juganot]
Gimme a dollar for all the women that hollered
After hearin me on radio spittin that yada yada (Yeah)
Uh! I have alot enough to buy myself a yacht and sail
Away to somewhere hot about a hundred knots an hour (HA!)
Sippin on Coladas how you doin pretty mama? (HEY!)
If this is all a dream you can leave me in the coma (UH HUH)
Cause I don't wanna 'wake and have to deal with all the drama
Tryin to make it in America, etcetera, etcetera
Gotta get the cheddar up!

[Hook: Sample from "I Need A Dollar" by Aloe Blacc]
I need a dollar, dollar, dollar that's what I need (HEY! HEY!)
Well I need a dollar, dollar, dollar that's what I need (HEY! HEY!)
Said I need a dollar, dollar, dollar that's what I need
And If I share with you my story, would you share yo' dollar with me?!

[Verse Three: Cassidy]
The more money I make the more money I need
Cause I still got bills still got tummies to fee
And a bunch of these responsibilities is killin me
To pay bills I'll move that Hillary is you feelin me?
I got the Bentley I got the Benz I got the Beamer
And I got the watch full of frozen Aquafina's
I hug the block cause I love the gwop
I need a dollar like Juganot, cuz you a thug or not?

[Verse Four: Red Cafe]
Yeah! Bring Havoc when a team move Mobb Deep
Alot of niggas claim King I'm the marquee
Big bankroll life in the fast lane
Benjamins behind me like Andre's last name (WHAT ELSE!!!)
Remix that a bang for the whole winter
I'm a gold member, you a goal tender
Ciroc boy, never sober
Y'all takin orders, we takin over

[Bridge: Sample from "I Need A Dollar" by Aloe Blacc] (Papoose)
Well I don't know If I'm walkin on solid ground
Cause everything around me is, crumblin down
And all I want is, someone, to help meeeeeeee!!!!! (Papoose! Pa-poose!!!)

[Verse Five: Papoose]
I'll take a cow from a farmer feed it to all you cowards
Y'all can have the beef, all I want is the dollars
He workin out, he think he diesel like the sour
He can have the steroids all I want is the dollars
They knocked down the towers, build a mosque tomorrow
They dirty, give 'em blood bath and led showers
How can we have a tornado in Brooklyn?
It came from Hell's kitchen what is the devil cookin?!

[Verse Six: Maino]
Man you don't even know what I'll do for a dollar
Push a nigga mama off the roof for a dollar
Hop out the bushes with the tek for a dollar (DAMN)
Wouldn't wanna see me stress for a dollar
"Cause I get it poppin, just for a Porche
And my chick want a bag and my boy need Jordan's
Big body Benz no tints I'm bossin
The thought of bein broke just makes me nauseous

[Hook: Sample from "I Need A Dollar" by Aloe Blacc]
I need a dollar, dollar, dollar that's what I need (HEY! HEY!)
Well I need a dollar, dollar, dollar that's what I need (HEY! HEY!)
Said I need a dollar, dollar, dollar that's what I need
And If I share with you my story, would you share yo' dollar with me?![Intro: Red Cafe]

Cash, cash, I gets hella cash
Shawty don't judge me, I might fuck you fast
Then get out of Dodge, hop in my Dodge
Camaro, Fidel Castro, look
Cocaine connect, now what I'm known as
Believe I dropped a few burbs, where your zone at?
Believe I push hella pounds where your town at
And bet I press the chopper right where your frown at

What your life like? Nigga, mine real
That Rollie you wearin' foolery, nigga, mine real
I'm selling narcotics, so you know how come
I'm still balling on niggas without an album
I ain't out here preachin' like if I'm Malcom
I'm hella dirty in these streets, 730
ShakeDown, bitch, smoke till my lungs black
Only question I ask, "Fuck is my one's at?"
Fuck what these hoes doing, fuck who these hoes screwing
Put that ho in the street, let's get this dough moving
I slam Cadillac doors, whip, whip city then ice that crack gold

[Hook: Red Cafe]
Hello, hello, I'm mean, motherfucker

Hair weave kill 'em, rearrange her hairdo

I'm up on appeal for killing the Pro Tools
And niggas know my religion is tru
Horseshoes, curfew niggas, consort with killers
Lil' niggas is gassed up, it's time to burp you, niggas
See, every day is a weekend, we spend
Money on the strong pack, you niggas is weaklin's
Catch me on one, two, five and the wheat Timbs
Gucci hoodie on, look like a tall-ass Rakim
I'm a dread-head, rocking with the redhead
I'm from College Park where the feds tap a dead cell
Smoke Cool Js, back-to-back LL
You need clientele just so you can rock bail
Yeah, used to trap by a school zone
ATL, I had crack in my school clothes
Got into it with my car until the roof gone
Catch up, you too far back in the Grey Poupon
They say I'm a hoodlum in some new clothes
Hello, goodbye, I need some new hoes

[Hook][Hook]
I got a feeling
A real good feeling
I’mma be faded
The bar is open
We just bought it

Let the Champagne pour
[Red Cafe]
Damn I look good, Somebody take a photo
I run my his-house, You can ask Jojo
Yank fitted on, My money on Jeter
My girls all dimes, Lou Vuitton Divas
I’m fly like an overnight letter
Shorty, sleep with me
Make your overnights wetter
Better I’m faded (I’m faded)
And tonight I’m gonna get wasted
See to everybody listening, if it’s on I’mma get at ‘em
I can say whatever I’m a tax paying citizen
Middle finger up, I ain't got a conscience
I just go hard like the trio from Yonkers
Head honcho, Kush in the console
Bad boy, now they shook like Cosmo’s
I’m all that, everyday all black
Got Ciroc on deck so I’m faded off that

[Hook]

[Rick Ross]
Two homes on the block
Each one a mil and this ring on my finger is an E-1 deal
Canary yellow stone, can’t be faded
Fatigue belt, 45 made for the Navy
Young niggas ready to grapple down ya buildin’
I’m living chilling, arms wrapped around a Brazilian
In the presence of a Don, be cautious but calm
Can’t be faded, two pills a charm
She licks on my chest, reading tatts on my arm
Hit her form the back, same time my mind blown
Speechless so she scream in silence
A real bad boy and all my speeches violent

[Hook]

[Red Cafe]
Pour for them white girls, them light girls
We just buy all these bottles cause it excites girls
Yeah shorty go on kill a runway
I knew you would have been a supermodel one day
I’m mashing out lighting up on a highway
Shit, I’m supposed to be high
It’s the highway
Anybody wanna eat? Come saddle up
My team getting money, everybody tatted up
Marqee status, flights no baggage
Dope dicks make these hoes Cafe addicts
And I am the most hated
Bottles to the face, shake it up then spray it[Ryan Leslie:]
So when I fly, you fly, we fly together
And when I shine, you shine we shine forever

[Red Cafe:]

Five star chick 'bout that five star life

Blood in my veins, breath in my lungs

She wanna tear the mall down throwin’ stacks quick
Ask her address she holla Saks Fifth
You a lady boss, now you fly free
Put you in Jimmy Choo and you ain't even Chinese
Mixed cocktails, shaken not stirred
With her head in my lap, how can I not swerve?

I’ma show you why the ring finger need a peace sign
Yeah, since I was a knee high
Being fly was something thats in my Levi’s
My genes ya’ll, my DNA’s what I mean y’all

So peace shawty, but Ciroc had that peach in it?
Everything at ease, you in double M G presence

[J. Cole]
You ain't heard, a nigga like me
Been around the World twice sippin’ ice tea
Come with me, to Madrid thats where Real play
Quit the job baby, come and fuck me all day
You see my lifestyle’s been nothing but lifestyles
Late nights and early flights, rushing right now
But she, gotta have that, grab that, whats that? long?
Automatic, cut that, flush that, gone!
And I don’t wanna be a playa no more
Okay I’m lying, but I’m trying

Aye, aye bitch, try this
Guaranteed to turn a square to a bi bitch
You ain't down, b-b-bye bitch
I ain't got time for playing, I'm just saying man
We out here trying to function, man we out here trying to function
We out here trying to function, man we out here trying to function
We out here trying to function, man we out here trying to function
I ain't got time for playing, I'm just saying man
We out here trying to function, man we out here trying to function
We out here trying to function, man we out here trying to function
We out here trying to function, man we out here trying to function
I ain't got time for playing, I'm just saying man
We out here trying to function

[Verse 1: E-40]
I slid into the function (the throw)
Looking hella dipped (saucy)
Lit like a strobe light (like a strobe light?)
Hella diamonds on my wrist (bling!)
You can call me your highness cause I'm hella high in this
Play with their mind like a shrink like I’m a psychiatrist
No dryness, I make your chick hella climax, scream
Even nicer wet, she telling me that I'm the best
You don’t want her, I’ll take her off your hands and do you a favour
You might not regret it now but you gon'a regret it later
I'm about my paper, stapler right on the side of my hip
In case a hater want it, in case he decide to trip
Platinum planning, shipping and handling, see these are digital sales
Used to push E up from the scale but now it's legitimate skrill
You ain't understand it, that this game evolved from the heels
Vallejo Cali RB the H-I double L’s

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
Don’t compare me to niggas, I'm the last of my kind
Get forever through these bars, ever lasting my grind
If it ain't about money, then you wasting my time
Mix the molly with the liquor now get out of your mind
Gotta do is one for the town, it’s town business
I don’t even fuck with these clowns, the clown niggas
In the city where the dealers go broke they turn killers
And all the bad bitches got all the hoes they like niggas
In the city where we gonna do broke, we like figures
Get that bag then we going to work like Jay Bilas
We out here tryna function, tryna maintain
They said to don’t judge me, told the judge the same thang
So guess who is up in the club with the four nickel
Man I stay on the point like icicle
If I die tonight bring me back at the Coachella
Sick and tired of killing these hoes, I'm that nigga

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Look, got bad bitches, they ratchet
Bet the ding make them sing like an ad-lib
And all this money watch me flip it like a back flip
I'mma go to work on a pussy no practice
Ha, I'm a real niggas in the photo
Bottles in the air, we don’t care about no ho, no ho
Yeah, shout out my nigga dilo
Girl I know you want to but I need about 3-4
Yeah, pretty girls in the crib
I know they all models, that’s just how a nigga live
I'm like whoa, when she do the splits
And when she throw it back nigga don’t act like a bitch!
My niggas in the club with the 40
We just showed up with E-40, we like what’s happening woadie?
In the function ain't a competition, killing opponents
And I be killing the pussy but this is just for the moment, yikes

[Hook]

[Verse 4: French Montana]
Rocking the roller, 'til 5 in the morning
She popping the pill, then she busting it open
Like bitch try this, I'm a high risk
A bank roll, 4-5-6
She chasing the act, with a clip in the mac
For my Oakland niggas that be pimping the rap
I'm a New York nigga with a bailey

[Hook: Red Cafe]

Tongue out, legs open, Michael Jordan everything!

Green strip, red strip, green strip nigga

[Hook: Red Cafe]Buck town buck town
New York Giant dance when I touchdown
Subway killer call her for her name
Study right under the king from saint james
Birth place of the cough up a lung
Big homie died turned everybody young
New school of course I do my thing though
With my rock box in the black tango
New air forces or the chuck cheese
Tuck jewelries laying on the white tee
Fools got me tangle let me find out
Put a perm on that straighten it right out
Only city you could sell nicks
Get your bell rocked from JT smith
And learn something from a south bronx teacher
It's all sell pies not raise pizzas

[Chorus:]
I walk the walk
Name ring-bell from the south to north
What else... that's how I do...
I'm the "heart & soul of new york city"
Fresh to death arm and hammer piece lay across the chest
What else... till I'm laid to rest
I'm the "heart n soul of new york city"

[Verse 2:]
Been a few year threw the coke away
Now days you can find me round Loso's way
Your beat don't rock you too smooth
More than likely they gon reminisce over you
R A W nothing here soft
Dirty black trunk spite air off
All for one we all steam reefer
Patch over the eye Mona Mona Lisa
Every sunday I see the black moon
The bad boy locked up coming back soon
For ever I'm gangsta rap and that's that
Cause when them boys rap gangsta they like that
8 million stories still hear truth
This where they buried cannabis in the booth
10k on the ?
10k rocking that yankees sign

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
The bridge the bridge the bridge
New york jets love where I live
Ride rough stand up to them guns
But don't wanna do that without a big Pun
Foreigners try to crush our buildings
With 2 quarters in a dream make millions
Real recognize real from the face down
Around these parts it's a shake down
If murder was the case
Hopefully we ain't out murderin the race with a hot waste
I hate to sing ill street blues
Follow the leader of the new school

Birds flock a nigga they know I get to the bread
Ice ice cold

Shit might look trippy but we ain't tripping though
Might just be sipping but we ain't mixing though
Only time I ran was from the federales

They've been waiting for this shit like Mayweather and Pacquiao

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
I'm running the town
No fucking around
I'm fucking with Hov
I'm back on the brown
Walk through the valley the shadow of death
I'm pitching the white like I'm back on the mound
I'm in this pussy while you're in your feelings
Making a killing
Got work in the building
I'm living the life of a hustler child
Pop me a freak then I'm making a dealing
We in the streets, just me and my dog
Riding around with a strap in the car
My niggas shooters
My bitches is 'bout it
We smoking and drinking
Get fucked by the law
Ice ice cold
And we back in the hood with the OG kush

Big in the hood, big in the hood
Automatic weapons, blowing hella sour
Keep my bitches like my money
Come in at any hour

Verse 1
I'm a lover, baby
I'm not a fighter
So I keep the shooter close

I'm a bad boy
But I ain't black row
I ain't passed the mansion
I'm with the black mob
We run in your house
We don't take our hats off
We put that fire to that kush
Then we blast off
Look I ain't Big Meech
Look I ain't Larry Hoover
But I'm big in the hood
I got them ???
I'm in the Cadillac, sitting on 24s
No album, still I get plenty hoes
Polo everything, down to the socks
My whole shave it all, down to the blocks

Chorus
Look, I’m big in the hood
Big in the hood, big in the hood
Big in the hood, big in the hood!
Automatic weapons, blowing hella sour

Chorus

Buck fifty on the face of a snitch man

Bling blaow beotch, Jack Frost man
And I'm a Brooklyn nigga man
I stays off the good dark liquor man

Blue bandana, red bandana man
Fuck it, snap you a shot like you the camera man

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Freck Billionaire]
They need a armored car to bring the man jewelry in
Top (Candidate), call me (Manchurian)
Every stone that's on this man cool
Ain't no Frecks in the streets like a man who
The young bitches say "Let me hold a stack man"
They heard I eat across the board like Pac-Man
I brought some cash up in this bitch like a banker man
Plus I got the news for you, call me anchor man
Drop guap' on the bling no damn delay
I lay money in the ring like Mandalay
She says she left him at home, I said man he sweet
Cause the pussy on this bitch was magnifique
Quick to tell her boyfriend I don't know her man
I just cut the bitch, call me (Lawnmower Man)
If she choosin you should let her off the leash man
All you do is cuff 'em up like police man

The bright man like Chris Ayre, the ice man
Light tan on G4 the flight man
The kush keep me high even with the flight lands

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Fabolous]
Yeah... I'm the man - yes, shorty I'm the man
Lookin for some good shit, then I'm your man
Just say my name three times like Candyman

You know how the man do, Coupe is on Manu Ginobilis
And the truck is on Kobes
Through the bulletproof when you're in the Sport man
The slugs come through your window like bruh man
Aww man! There go your man again
I fifth him up, stiff him up like a mannequin
I ain't trippin but dude think he the Man of Steel
He slippin up and he don't even see banana peels
And one night I made plans to do him
The bitch is so easy a caveman could do her
She know I'm the man of the da-da-da-da-damn
But F-Y-I, let me tell you who I am (BITCH!)

[Hook]
