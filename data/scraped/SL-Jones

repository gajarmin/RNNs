[Verse 1: Pusha T]
They think that they know, something 'bout my life
Not in the same class, not on the same flight
Maybe the same club, just not the same lights
Both fucked the same bitch, just not the same night
You just took her phone number
I just took her home with a-
'Nother bitch, ménage
Boomerang, Strange'
Lipstick on my collar, Oscar de la renta(y)
Your hijo - pequeño, my nachos - bel grande
Stay sippin' that André
Spent 3 stacks - that's André
That Balmain, that Phillip Lim
They say I'm dressing like Kanye
I'm everything that my rhymes say:
Breadwinner, brand owner
Play Cloths, millionaire
Trendsetter, landowner
Hope your bitch don't land on him
Drink in his hand with the sand on him
You small time - you Hyundai's
Y'all couch niggas - we stand on em
Dope money with a band on it
Half gold, we got a hand on it
D-boys still ball the same
Just gotta little bit of glam on it
YAH!

[Verse 2: Bryant Dope]
I got flames for your download link
I let Ja Rule when I murder ink
Murder pink, murder what you thought and what you think
This Queens prodigy is the product of what you ain't
Well packaged to distribute to the masters
Plotted this since first grade classes
Class is elements of a classic
I've got evidence of a master
You never thought you'd be bodied by a bastard
A bachelor who backspin on breakbeats
Break necks of broke souls who hate me
Hate he? You can't take my heat
Fireball flow, can't bat in my league
I'm the best rapper that's been slept on
Stick around like gum that's been stepped on
Stepped on, I stepped up, so what up?
Tryna make bread with these damn cold cuts
I cold crush every beat that I touch
My words silk and my flow is pure plush
Tell HudMo Dope says "what's up?"

[Verse 3: Go Dreamer]
Go Dreamer's a [?], wish upon a star
I'm too cold for Pluto so I'm movin' back to Mars
Cause this that spaceship, that space shit
This that category 5, this that quake, bitch, that quake, bitch
See I'm so funked out, like out of here
Like blue lights in the basement
And it's a red state, in Georgia with it
Last verse, did you get it? Nah
Never mind, just throw that cash in a duffle
As I'm on my Hollywood shuffle
Eatin' your million dollar truffles, this acquirin' taste
Tantalise so you can see the bigger picture that God is the light
In the fixture or in the background
Cut all the hatin' in the background
Cause if music and money is the motive then you're so gimmick
Who's to tell me I can't have a trillion dollar grilled cheese sandwich?
Boy stop playin', stop playin'
I'm just sayin', just sayin'
Now who else wanna fuck with Hollyweird Go?

[Verse 4: Retch]
Break up and roll it, light it and smoke it
Pass it, don't hold it, lovin' that potent
I'm drunk and I'm rollin', it still got me goin'
These bad hoes is gruntin', their booties is pokin'
Out them little dresses, a nigga wanna fuck
He don't even smoke but tell Butter roll a blunt
Cause I'm way too drunk and I'm too turnt up
And I brought my own shit and I do my own stunts
Young and I'm wildin', new drugs, I try em
He'll call me Retch but your bitch call me Bryan
In Polo I'm stylin', it's all that I'm rockin'
If you catch me out in 'Lo it's a problem
'Less it's a Champion suit, then I'm draggin'
Fuck with me, I got all this 'Lo all from raggin'?
Used to have a nigga that was down to get to clappin'
Seen it on a video, he yappin' to the captain
That nigga snitchin', R86 him
These niggas trainers cause these niggas switchin'
And these niggas bitchin' more than these bitches
And I'm just so sick of this shit, it's ridiculous
Middle finger to the feds, [?] all day
Take her out to eat then I make a bitch pay
And my wine [?] and my shrimps sautéed
And I'm chillin' in LA with a bitch for the day

[Verse 5: Nipsey Hussle]
Ain't that a bitch?
Foot up on the gas, ain't no brakes in this bitch
Cover girl givin' face to the Crip
Somethin' 'bout a nigga on the way to the chips
High off the money and I'm wasted as shit
High off the life and she can't get a grip
Hundred dollar cup and you can't get a sip
I'm a million dollar nigga, you should take you a flick
Hundred thousand dollar car where I sit
And my broad is the shit
Crenshaw in the 6
Got it parked at the Shell in front of all of the Crips
You either ball or you brick
She don't know money so she callin' you rich
You ain't got game so you fall for the shit
Spend it all in this bitch 'til it's gone and she split
Now you feel like a wimp
Talkin' 'bout what you was buildin' and shit
Got you all up in your feelings and shit
Problem is, she addicted to the real nigga shit
To the real nigga shit
50 dollar, hundred dollar bill shit
Gold crown on a real nigga wrist
Fresh like my nephew Khalil in this bitch
.40 cal, no concealing the shit
4 gun cases, I'm still with this shit
Backlit, wood wheel when I whip
Got her right up on my lap, that's a real nigga risk
In the field on my tip
Hoes like Phil then I Stockton assist
It ain't no stoppin' shit
Avoid the potholes, put stocks on the 6

[Verse 6: Problem]
Got Mary blowing Jane
We fucking high, sex on a plane
Hey newscaster, we about to reign
Loving the club because we fill the section with pain, c'mon
Blow him up, finna explode
All of hell's kitchen praying he don't stick from the stove
God got me, illum-i-not-me written in bold
Slept on, now I'm everywhere like g-g-g-go crazy
'Bout 150
Let me tell y'all now, I want Nicki
Lift her up high up like helicopter far away from her fellow
Let her play problem
While problem tongue play with propeller (what)
Keep fresh just in margielas
Diamond lane running thangs ain't shit you can tell us (don't tell us nothing)
Done everything, ain't shit you can sell us
Money over bullshit, friction derail us (naw)
[?] niggas, yeah we take it or leave it
But know it's over since I was [?]
You nervous like I thought you seen [?]
Got everybody thanking me
[?]
I'm a boss [?]
[?]
[?]
Cause I'm a mad man
Fuck niggas like the Klan, man
Put you to sleep like the sandman
Give me the throne, I'm a chairman (diamond)
Rolex beat, it's time for just winning, no fakes
Just copped more 45's and 9s, I ain't talking bout no J's
Please be afraid but I ain't the shooter
[?]
Riding shotty in the chevy [?] know as a Krueger
Lyrical Ruger, pop your medulla
You lukewarm, boy, go get you a cooler please
Your bitch know that I'm cooler, please
Your bitch know that I'm cooler, please
So cool I could fucking die if I drop a few degrees
Boss daddy used to call the police
Get it good girl, use your knees
I love them brainiacs
Yeah, my last ho had a few degrees (for real)
Back on my Compton shit
Demonic how I demolish shit
Angelic with my intuition
Student of game make hoes pay tuition (huh)
No dice, no pill, but I'm on a roll
That one nigga that Kendrick can't control (what)
Problem

[Verse 7: Danny Brown]
(CHECK!)
That Ambien in my ink pen
Move the brown squares like Wheat Thins
Y'all five days and a weekend
Stay smokin' on that defense
That's 2 or 3 and I'm zonin'
Got money like I cloned it
Your bitch came through and I owned it
Rims on the Caddy and I ice-cream coned it
Homie, you ain't hitting on nothin'
Drop that top when I hit that button
Pimp so hard it's a full time job
Swear, 12 stacks in my glove box
Bitch niggas, tell me what it's gon' be
Young nigga chop it up 223
Come to the D, don't hit OGs
And my advice is stay low-key
Bitch we great, bitch we great, fuckin' set
Bitch we jump up, bitch we jump up, we gotta have it
Gotta get it, we gotta get it, we gonna take it
Bitch we jump, say bitch we jump, we gotta make it
Couple racks up on them [?]
Your bitch here smoked my trippy stick
Ridiculous, put dick on tit, spit on clit
And it's over with, I'm over it
No sober shit, drink til I just throw up and shit
Y'all ho told me come over here
So guess what nigga it's over with
And it's over with

[Verse 8: Meyhem Lauren]
Fresh out the wave pool, my niggas made cool
We wrote the blueprint for the shit y'all niggas try to do
If I'm not outside, then I'm probably inside your boo
My team's official, you ain't shit, that's why she's trying my crew
Pardon me, I move retardedly
This shit is old to me, the real New York is part of me
I'm always shopping, keep it fly, Lauren is archery
Don't get it twisted, realistic, I could part the sea
My life is fast, I take a chance when I insert the key
And then I turn it up, that's really how you work the V
Your stash ain't never dry if you getting your work from me
We do this fly shit perfectly, we're enough to rise the mercury
Heat nigga, street nigga
Reflect those both when I be rapping on the beat, nigga
Looking Cambodian while standing at the podium
My flow was opium, we cock bottles and open them
Laurenovich

[Verse 9: Raekwon]
Stop by, tryna see a nigga
All I buy is these trees, king
100 ki's in them streets, nigga
Mask me up in grease
Sneaker game is lethal
N.Y., them eagles
Fly through, get high too
Fly as hell, might as well
Hire you the live group
Come through with that live crew
Birds chirpin', cop that Birkin
Boo, yo, I supplied you
Liable to be in Beirut, no Beirut, this debut
Slick, little niggas get gun pounding
Keep moving, who saved you?
Play who? Not me
Me and Bronson, not we
Two real niggas sitting in the East Coast
Ice is on, heat close
Fuck around and kill one of y'all clown ass niggas, word up
Take your two, take your hat
Take a nap, put your ass ton the ground, little niggas
We pound niggas and drown niggas and
Hemmied up,  that brown, niggas
All my niggas get stemi'd up
Hennessy, Louie V
Me and you, me and her
We as one and she is done
Battle rap me three to one
Freedom after, kingdom come

[Verse 10: Vado]
Triple hundred K in my duffle
Give a hundred K to my muscle
Slept a hundred days, just wakin' up
Need a brick, just break it up
Break it down, then take the cut
We shave around like a taper cut
I weigh the pound, if you hatin' us
'Bout to paint the town, most hated what
Most hated what
Grab the dice then shake 'em up
Talked hundreds since 8 and up
You lost the onions, no makin' up
No blunts but y'all fake as fuck
It's gym time and I'm shapin' up
I've been foulin', when Blake get up
You gon' waste a life, you need to hang it up
Dreams, click clack
Man down with that chrome Uz'
On his back like "nigga don't move"
Word to mother, we don't lose
Talk [?] like we don't move
See Gutter, be home soon
See Gutter, he'll be home soon

[Bridge: Vado] x2
What's good? Talk the money, what's good?
Haters frontin', what's good?
I'm pullin' up like, "What's good?"
You know I got it, what's good?
My people's 'bout it, what's good?
Never stop, we never settle
Gotta push the pedal in that hood

[Verse 11: Kilo Kish]
I sit in the back of the room
Legs crossed, melting wax
Another free drink so soon?
All good, knock it back
Red lights, heart attack
Just a dream with no end in sight
Waking up to evening
Now it seems I live this rotten life
Spoiled rotten life, frozen hair with burning hands
Coming out to dance with other drones who couldn't give a damn
But when the night calls
Redcurrant lipstick with the lights off
Look at all the bottles lined up
Wondering who they could pop for
Golden ember to the black floor
Burning monks to [?]
Part of the action
Retweet, now you're the attraction
Sit around and watch them
Watch their faces and reactions
Then blur the lines until the sun
Is back on your horizon

[Verse 12: Juice]
Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe
Inhale, potent marijuana running shit like the mayor
Rap game Peter Parker web swinging through the air
My minds in the clouds and I ain't got a beer
See I ain't got a care kill them now and reap the benefits
Coldest nigga out and I ain't sold no fucking disc
Henny bottle-eater, 3 grams in the fuckin' spliff
Call it what you want I'm a zombie bitch I'm off this shit

[Verse 13: Erick Arc Elliott]
Yo prada never gonna pile up
If you can't follow this game, nigga
My team smoking that green
If you ain't seen me then you must be a lame, nigga
And I'll give you three shots hold this heat down
Shorty pussy so wet she could soak a beach towel
But meanwhile, Effortless, so she thought it was a freestyle
Everybody wanna floss like a G now
What about me? Never had a bitch nigga doubt me
Zombie gang all y'all niggas pace is shit
On some basic shit it's no wonder that you sound the same
So forever am I living staying out of prison
Mommy told me different but these hoes don't hear it
Forever am I living staying out of prison
Mommy told me different but these hoes don't hear it

[Verse 14: Meech]
I heard life's a bitch so I spit and stimulate her clit
Hitting licks Henny shots hitting licks on the ave
Hitting licks who is this? that be Meech
Zombie walking casualty beat the beat till it's actually fragments
Coke off her areola and no not a can of soda
Tearing flesh pussy pink look like Cam's Range Rover
No High school diploma but baby I'm a street soulja
School of the hard knocks every class I leap over
Smith and Wesson .500, long nose, mazel tov
Shoot a man who squeal then I peel like an old cut
Like my women heightened and not even trying
And if she leaky leaky then Meechy gon' dive in
Ha, mic check check me, skin darker than Wesley
Two-eighths of shrooms got me dancing like Mr. Bentley
Mind yo' fuckin' business, why you think the whip is tinted?
The darkest nigga in it sparking up to infinite

[Verse 15: Renegade El Rey]
Renegade, nigga let's get it straight from the gate
I'ma tell you what it is, I'ma tell you what it ain't
See you ain't gotta question
Or better yet second guess anything that I might say
You see not a single syllable is out of place
I rock a venue, people barely know my name
What I'm tryna tell you is I ain't gotta tell you a fuckin' thing
I'ma show so you know
Niggas either do or they don't
And bein' number two is what I won't be
I'm silencin' lambs and sheep, don't sleep
Cause my characteristics are that of a cannibal
Call this shit Hannibal Lector
My timing's impeccable, sharp like a razorblade
And you look dissectible
I've been on my mind for days
Cause homie we've been in the grind for years
Southern eagle nigga, fuck 'em all mane, we don't fly in fear
I grew up in the city where they figured they can kill dreams when they kill king
To get their shot, [?]
I stay strapped, fuck you mean?
'Bout my green, I need bread, I'm like "Fuck the rest"
When I need bread, I'm like "Fuck the rest"
I be up all night tryna chase the check
Prolly spent it fast, I need to make it back
M.E.M.P.H.I.S, they could never stop me
Check these lames and pimp this game
Let's put it in my pocket

[Verse 16: Rockie Fresh]
And they will never know 'bout all the nights that we prayed
All the meetings we took, and all the records we played
I tried to tell 'em I'm the shit, but they told us, "no way"
With no cuts, they're like a barber, they're about to catch fade
My number one rule is that I gotta get paid
I've been thinkin' this way since I was in the 6th grade
No English, I ain't talk, but boy could add
In the school of hard knocks I'm a fuckin' grad
In these Pumas I'ma run shit, high so I'm above shit
Lame ass niggas I don't fuck with
Bathing Ape trucker, I'm a fly mothafucka
My team lookin' at me like every time it's supper
Cause they know I'm gon' feed 'em, Rocky been a boss
I ain't worried 'bout the price cause I can clearly pay the cost
I'm the sharpest guy around and I'ma always cut my loss
Then come back for the win, I'ma make it, then I spin

[Verse 17: Pill]
Real west side nigga, [?]
Might pull the piece, somebody call a Buddhist
[?] put me high [?]
You can do that, flyin', fuck, do this
And yeah I'm from the slimiest place where the bombs are pacin'
Niggas call me Jason when the guns are chasin'
Might hit 'em with the TEC, yeah the foul is flagrant
You be on [?]
Hand in the bowl when your hand really cold
Work the light in the day shift
I don't really give a fuck as long as I get paid shift
New Cadillac, chopper, no new blade shit
I go crazy on this beat right now
I really gotta go and spit heat right now
Don't matter what the fuck it's prada
Well fitting suits eating on clam chowder
Knock it out the park like Eric Estrada
Remember I was shoppin' at Family Dollar
Got your main bitch Facebookin', beggin' for a swallow
Pop this pill then I pop my collar
Park this shit then I toss a couple dollars
Instagram, gon' post for some follows
I've been in and out my zone if you really wanna know
I got Hen and got Patron if you're really tryna go

[Verse 18: Bodega Bamz]
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
I'm what the music game need
Like Rich when he just came home
And then gave the keys to a cherry 3 Series
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
Fucker, that AK go chopped
7:30 my time, I'm on psychiatric watch
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
Show and prove for what?
I got XXL mula, I got bitches tryna get fucked
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
Now you're dead, pussy boy catch up
Pool junkie rack up, nigga, act up
Trunk with the mac truck bulletproof'ed up
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
Double parked on murder lane
187 my address, Boulevard of pain
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
My cellphone backed up
My clientele meet once
No voice mail, just call me up, uh
646 684 011 011
Hit me up when you want that coke
Hit me up when you want more drugs
646 684 011 011
Hit me up when you want that coke
Hit me up when you want more drugs

[Verse 19: Remy Banks]
As I sit back and roll up this black demeanor
Reminiscing on my past, still dreaming about that Beamer
Shit, I never was that kid in the streets gripping on Nina's
Instead, I was that nigga puffin reefer, fucking lolitas
With the baddest features
Dog 'em then it's onto the next like I do my sneakers
That was the life I was living, careless about their feelings
Caught cheating, ask for forgiveness, of course I got my way
But now I'm older and wiser, cruising through summer days
With a little Ma riding in the passenger, she rolling up that lavender
Purple cannabis rapture, head high like a Jersey in the rafters
You wing a Frazier, some smart players until we major
Traveling the world, collecting paper, pissing off these haters
Come back home and invest in something then ball out later
In five star restaurants high as hell when I tip my waiter
Providing for my seed when I bring one in this world
But until that day gets here I'm thinking about these joints, twerk

[Verse 20: Killer Mike]
Lord have mercy
I'm so motherfucking fresh to death, better call my hearse
My hearse a 72442 with an all wood wheel and that bitch'll vert
My Oldmobile is a cold mobile
Got a cold, young chick down in Mobile
My stacks so fat can't even hold that
Fold that, lay flat like I lack no wheel
Lay flat like I lack no wheels for real
A nigga had to cold the corner, move crack for real
Move crack for real, no rap shit
But I rap rap shit, my rap shit for real
So you rapping ass rabbit ass ratchet ass niggas
Gotta listen to these raps for real
Cuz, I don't give a fuck if you a Blood or a cuz
Cause I draw blood for real
Tryna hang in my city, tryna see a bitch titty, no pity
Nigga, you'll get hit for real
These maggot ass hoes ain't hit on shit
They'll set you up for the loot shit, man
Thinking that's your bitch, better have your shit
Better have quick hands like Gucci Mane
Niggas tryna get a brick of Kathy Lee Gifford
Better be strapped like Clifford
It's the big, black nigga then drip of the big black pistol
I suggest you confess where you keeping all the money, mister
At the work she see a hearse
But at the best he just will pistol whip ya
Get to see you child and live
Lord have mercy, please forgive 'em, gone

[Verse 21: Del Harris]
Young Del God is handsome
Your girl, she's on ransom
She don't wanna come back
Cause you don't make her cum
On the beats I do go dumb
And I do her till she numb
And I make her soaking wet when she grab that water gun
Now fuck that brag rap, man
I'm Batman, I'm Bruce Wayne
I'm kickin' it, I'm Liu Kang
I'm killing these niggas, they're too lame
Unorthodox, they too tame
I'm right hand but play left
I'll chop a trend down 'til there ain't no more plain left
Now pay respect to them gods, niggas
Not talkin' church, I'm talkin' rides niggas
On boulevards when we ride
Hovercrafts cause we fly
Q Gang 'til I die
Pyramid on my eye
Button up on my chest
[?] chain on top, no tie
While I'm choppin' up this Thai food
Young Del God make god moves
Young Del God say "fuck fate"
If I lose then I choose to
This that chateau rap, that shit that niggas ain't used to
Might salad fork while I choose to
While I'm fine dining on YouTube
I'm a king, I said that I'm a king
Go to Onyx with an Onyx [?] on my ring

[Verse 22: YG]
I'm back in this bitch bashing
These rappers be swagger jacking
Clap 'em not, they don't even matter
1-2, this lung been splattered
And I heat a pistol on something
I keep a fifth on the belt
Pulling out the needles with the liable
Make shine sit on the shelf
Cause I ain't light on the body
Fuck waiting in your lobby
Hannah Montana finally did grew up
I've been waiting on Miley
I'm gangbanging 'til I break my fingers
Ti'l all my family members speak the slanguage
I ain't even drop no album yet
Off mixtapes, that's how I've been maintaining
If you offended, nigga, sorry
In backs there is bodies
Have your best friend, cuzzo, uncle, pops and another
Bury you in front of everybody
If I ain't been who you are I don't fuck with you
If I fuck with you then I'm stuck with you
I'm stuck with you, I'll shoot it out
Do some years and a couple months with you, woo

[Verse 23: CyHi da Prince]
Lyrically I am the epitome of a real MC
Biblically I am Timothy, visually I am Tripoli
Full of bigotry, fighting with Gaddafi over liberty
Politically I'm Barack smoking pot, sipping Hennessy
That's my only vice, old school noisy pipes
I ain't tryna be the richest, I'm cool with an M like Obie Trice
Rappers sing the same song, it must be karaoke night
That shit sound like you sang the hokey pokey twice
But this the main event, can't tell me that I ain't a prince
A one-hit wonder to your girl cause I came and went
But this that fly talk, smoke it, you'll get high off
The best thing to happen to the street since the sidewalk
Or the stop sign, or the shots flying
From a Glock 9, now the block crying, I don't freestyle, I jot mine
Call me Mr 1-800, all I got is hotlines
These niggas tell so many stories they can overlook the skyline
Biatch

[Verse 24: Young Thug]
Thugger!
Y'all got me drunk as hell
Now I been rich since I was little like Robin Hood
They been hatin' on me, cutting my cable cords
They gon' hate on her when she come in Michael Kors
Meanwhile, your diction is lack, grippin' this wood
I want you
She went to grabbin' for my jewels, I told her
Buy yourself a squad, you get a rollie, rollie
She know she can't have it, that shit love my woadie
She want to buy him a chinchilla
She see you serve foreign country boys from the village
Always, I gotta stand her
No, she don't want nobody to eat but her
She but like fuck them digits, stack them digits
Cut them then we benefit, cut them then we send them into
She ride three deep with molly in the middle
Put Micky Thompsons all on my Jeep
Ain't got no handprints on my golds, they all on my seat
Ten-thousand-dollar toe rings, featured by me
Bitches know it's time out
They be fucking me so good, I be like 'Time out!'
They want to fuck me 'til I tell 'em all to time out
She stroke it, I can't coach it, I'm like 'Time out!'
I'm not no snitch, but I be tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
Tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
I'm so tired of tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
Tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
Now I'ma show 'em
Her posse beat me by the threes, I call 'em Reggie Miller
She roll my weed in giant ?, she tall like 'Zilla
I want you
Baby, don't you run from me, you know I want you
She down with Slime, she got a tattoo in another color
Thugger getting high in London
Bitches walking 'round naked in no pajamas
Lil' homie ran off with lots of numbers
And for that, I'm gonna fuck your aunt, your sis, your mama
Then pop a pill together
She want to feel just like I feel, we growing wings together
Everything perfect about her, can't get my things together
I turn her up and we shit out earthlings together
Just do it like Michael Montana
My ? say I got stamina
I cooking the Hannah Montana
I bury these hoes like Santas do
I kill every one of my features
I spend all my money on divas
My pockets on yella bands
Just like a beeper

[Verse 25: A$ton Matthews]
They found Max B prints in my way
Bitch, I rode the Red Sea through my biblical days
No roof, snow boots, and that Persian [?]
Perving the 80's, you ain't never surf with the Brady's
Ric Flair, a heavyweight champion
Got Trish Stratus with them panties on singing "daddy's home"
Bust it, in these Space Jams, I'm a Monstar
Do-rag, tote on, that cake blocked in an arm war
So rumble, young man, rumble
Young killa when he came out the jungle
Young dealer in the rains with the bundles
Gets no realer, get chipped when you stumble
Eat the ox on the foil, ten toes in the soil
Chop chop 'till he drop, fuck what you thought
I never leave my life with a lawyer
Eyes wide with my head on the swivel
Choose a side or get left in the middle
I just treat with the sand on the beach
When the desert eagles meet, then I'm finna beat
Rest them in their sleep, you can lose 'em to the beef
Move or we shooting in the jeep
Homicide coming through the sneaks
Your hands ain't moving with your cheek
Bag 'em up and move 'em up the creek

[Verse 26: Prodigy]
On my test, got a story to 'em
Like all my raps weigh more than music
The more I write, the better I do it
And right now my stock is up
I do me from day one, huh
My nigga you know where it hit fours
Still fuck with me at day hundred
Cause I don't play, I gets off
Piss off, bitch, you ain't lit
You just a nigga saying shit
Rappers burn out, Pasadena, Kansas state
Mobb Deep is that truth, liar
Prodigy is that fuel fire
Come try me, I show better than tell, Infamous empire
I'm on point like the state building
I stay sharper than razor blades
Think you doing the most, I give you the most
Slashes to the face
Hoes like "he so angry", uh
Trust me bitch, you gon' thank me
Cause when it pop and the smoke gone
We gon' walk outta here safely
Fuck with me, I got you
Real nigga, no costume
This modern art that I spit
It's not no bullshit, and colossal
So pour it up, pour it up, that's how we ball out
Cause when I bomb on these niggas it's worse than nuclear fall out

[Verse 27: SL Jones]
Keep the small bills separate from the hundreds, please
That bank vault can't talk but the numbers read
And the tellers makin' statements, breakin' all the codes
This ain't a mothafuckin' date, we takin' all the hoes
Shop 'til I drop, freshest corpse in the morgue
Lookin' like a fashion fossil, I'm Gianni reborn
Four, I was voted most likely to trap
It's survival of the trillest, nigga, die or adapt
Waste a lot of champagne but I don't waste a drop of time
Public with my gang relations, throwin' up the proper signs
Sawed off the shotty, got the chopper circumcised
Chevy so clean, look like I dipped that bitch in turpentine
All my homies certified, hottest nigga outchea
Look like [?] we burned alive
Thought that I would ball 'til I fall, then I learned to fly
Spread my wings
They say success is contagious so I share my dreams

[Verse 28: Nasty Nigel]
Bolo swingin' from left to right
I'm not a cholo but I know hoes out in SoHo lovin' my ethnic type
When I smile for the photo looking like Lobo
Me and my bloodshot eyes
I pass on the Bud Light Lime
Just pass me that brew of St. Ides
Got cash, I ain't gotta think twice
Unconventional shit
Pretentious hipsters that diss
Half-assed review on Fader
Still get no love from Pitchfork
Nigel Rubirosa, que la cosa?
Feet up on the sofa
Heat up on the holster
World's Fair! Yeah, you know us
11-36-8 be the zip code
Corona, Queens nigga
That's what I call home
Feet on the dash, mind on the ass
Racin' the Sun just so I can get dome
Pimped the shorties I've been with
My friends that had me evicted
It's been two years and I'm slippin'
Still got no pot to piss in
It's everyone goes, they can suck a [?]
We have another song, I won't fuckin' feel it
Got my eyes on the Harley and I'm trying to peel it
Had my eyes on the bitch but she married Keaton
Got no job so I'm hardly eatin'
And you eatin' then we fuckin' beefin'
I need a pie and pizza just to meet up for a fuckin' feature

[Verse 29: Bobby Creekwater]
Man, they don't wanna see a nigga
Winning in a mothafucka
Happier than a mothafucka
You know lightweight grinnin' in a mothafucka
When you're a dead guy and you on that high
So the whole world spinnin' in a mothafucka
And a couple young angels hide their halo
Cause they're 'bout to start sinnin' in a mothafucka
They don't wanna see a nigga on the upswing
In a black tux with cufflinks
When you're the reason that every single girl in the party
Wanna dance and cuff drinks
When you're the reason that shit gets ran
And mothafuckas wheezin' to keep up with the plan
And the other niggas show up at your function
Actin' all anti-social [?]
Run up on your mama puttin' money in her hand
And you do that shit again and again and again
Pull up in the 8, goin' home with a 10
And you really can't defend or depend on your friends
Ex girlfriend wanna key up the Benz
When the Sun comes up, nigga we up to win
Mothafuck you man, all you do is set trends
And you do that shit again and again and again

[Verse 30: Action Bronson]
Ugh, ugh
Got those motherfucking custom Roshes
Feel me?
This big beard cover my face
Until my mother gets her first crib
My hand's on some surf shit
My Spanish mami perfect
Fuck around and get your father's shirt lift
Drop a thousand on some sake and some urchin
Swing the Dodge Viper lefty like I'm Randy Johnson
Hand me the Thompson
I'll spill your clams on the carpet
Then eat some snails with some garlic
Paint the town with a harlot
Cream FILAs and Carhartt
Three-wheelin out the car lot
Put the snorkel on the Wrangler cause I'm silly
I chip a little piece of brick into the philly
My daughter's neck is chilly
My son's neck is chilly
My mother wrist so cut
Look like it got bit by a grizzly
And these drugs got me spinning like some capoeira
Still rock the slow beats with gold teeth
Ain't afraid to hold heat
Control the Jeep
That's for the slow creep
Ya fuckin' pussy smells like old meat
It's me

[Verse 31: Heems]
Heema the highest human, flyest cumin in my unit
I ?, the shorties swoonin', and they want to get to spoonin'
Never wished i was taller, himanshu ain't no midget
Never wished i was a baller, if I want it, then I get it
I built a fucking blueprint, like who the fuck you kidding?
I;m ridin' around and I'm gettin' it, if it's mine, i'm spending
You lames and you fall, i'm like 2 Chainz when i ball
Got Husseins on my feet and Husains on my wall
Hussein Chalayans, a pretty girl said that's fancy
Unless his name is Hussein, give a fuck who your mans be
My shoes got dials, they ain't got laces
If you got beef, I show up with many faces
Been to many places where we leaving many casings
Running 'round, man, but we never catch no cases
Give a fuck about what you say, kicking it with like two babes
Top off, toupee, hot as fuck, creme brûlée

[Verse 32: Mike G]
There's no way I can care about much
You probably do the most and it's never enough
King Midas, I can make gold with a touch
Change my location to awesome, you should address me as such
Swear this game, you have to know it like the back of your hand
Destined to be like Superman for as long as you can
Wondering what's the purpose without living a life so grand
The worst hand is having the world without a master plan
I feel like you gotta pardon Mike for taking over this Earth
And [?] sleepless nights and long flights
And I don't like discussions unless it concerns a price
If you make it out of spite, you still make it so it's alright
I spit magic, so cold and lavish
Bad broads perform sexual acts in traffic
So smooth, the saxophone and jazz is
[?] what you lack and focus on what you have in the G
More than average, I'm nothing to test
If it's to me, you step and contest, then bring your best
Give it your all, now women beg me to call
And unless we overseas, we don't shop in the mall
Consider this move so private I've become urban myth
My aim is so swift, with this I can't miss
Top notch, number one on everybody's list
I promise to kill them all til everybody's missed

[Verse 33: Yak Ballz]
I never sell drugs, I took 'em
Never write rhymes, I cook 'em
I'm from the Old New York
Where you got your chain snatched
And your kicks tooken
I put my city up like I'm bench pressing
Scorin' high off the [?]
Brutal, last in 10 seconds
Jolly good, body good
I met a stripper named Hollywood
In Hollywood, glass slipper
And she gave me the sloppy gooooood
So you should tip her if you execute
Young leisure suit
[?] with no extra loot
My ex left me destitute
So chances are I don't remember you if I slept with you
You want karats, I'm turnin' rappers to vegetables
City of God, I'm askin' what would the devil do?
Instagram it, I forever rule, Ricky

[Verse 34: Zebra Katz]
Super villain, I'm killin', kick in the door
Watch me spillin' 'em, fuckin' winnin'
Straight killin' haters, they catchin' them feelings
See me grillin', me drillin', like we chillin'
But really see I'm fulfillin' their fantasies
Like I'm fuckin' my frienemy
Yo what's up, see me on [?] tryna get buck
Where in the world did he get that from?
When the bass drop down and he kick that drum
So what's up? Where in the world did he get that from?
Where in the world did he get that from?
When the bass drop down and he kick that drum
Yeah I've been known to really fuck it up
[?] zip zap zup
Speedin' on the highway, Bronco truck
When you ask for the Katz, mothafucka here I come
Yeah I've been known to really fuck it up
[?] zip zap zup
Speedin' on the highway, Bronco truck
When you ask for the Katz, mothafucka here I come

[Bridge: Zebra Katz] x2
Need [?]? Well I got it right here
Need motivation for the ass to gon' twerk? Well I got it right here
If you need a thing, a thing, then I got it right here
[?] I got it right here, I got it right here

[Verse 35: Curtis Williams]
Most of these niggas gon' hate
Me and my niggas get paid
One nigga swing then we all gon' swing
We all gon' catch that case
Couple blunts to the face, got a nigga straight
Rappin' on beats got a young nigga made
What can I say? My closet got Bape
I don't do delays, I want it today
Noisy pack in my wrap
Hennessy in my cup
Ginger ale if I chase
But I really don't do that much
I really don't have no time
You ain't tryin' to get no funds
Doin' this shit 'til I die
I'm rollin' and smokin' on drugs

[Verse 36: Reese]
Rollin' up, chokin' up on the kush smoke
Whip sick, big wheels, Big Willie shit
Hot boxer, hot sauna, car full, thick
I love the constituents, is down to get their lids peeled
Still pimpin', ridin' 'round town gettin' low
With my bright skin shawty, call her light show
She like Reese I'm tryna light that
Show love, she hold me down like an ice pack
It's big faces on faces bruh
Big faces on faces bruh
Dead men in my pockets got me goin' up
It's goin' face down if a nigga flex us
Yeah, in God we trust, but bands is a must
We gotta get that, spend that, get that
Re-up, recoup, repeat that

[Verse 37: Dave]
Say deuce 9 in that ending
Been winning since the beginning
Did a couple shows, need a couple more
That price right but we skippin'
[?] we gettin' it
With that work I turn into a chemist
Walter White, send a [?] to my niggas locked up in prison
Free my nigga Chris
And free my uncle Marky
Now tell them they fucked up
When they told 'em they could start me
Cause I ain't lettin' up, they're talkin' 'bout the best
They better mention us, yeah they better mention us

[Verse 38: LightSkinMac11]
Apartment off [?]
Rottweiler just to watch 'em
Maybachs for the profit
Get a Lexus for my mama
Hail Marys for our fathers
Press the pedal to get farther
In that new thing
[?] the dollar
All about it so don't fuckin' bother
My loose change got me Bruce Wayne
And a 3 page spread
Y'all was sleepin' on the flow just a couple months later
Now y'all purchasing the flow, East Coast

[Verse 39: Alkebulan]
King, god, pharoah
Feared the sensei, go for bone marrow, save
My name is running coyote
I'm on peyote with the queen, running on waves
I will make water out of Hennessy
[?] a monk, I was born a public enemy
Reign insurmountable
A woman will make me climax but she won't be into me
This is not a dream, marchin', in all black
A black claimed king
Respect the illustrator
Don't you dare try the Elohim of flexin'
I say my name when I name drop, son
Who's the god in this pantheon?
Two-9, Alkebulan, Alkebulan, Alkebulan, Alkebulan

[Verse 40: CEEJ]
Get up trick
Put your head to your knees like a sit-up, bitch
Get too live for the crew, Two-9
We're the new 2 Live Crew, give up, bitch
Send 'em all to Hell, [?]
Spit it like braille, gotta feel this shit
[?] check up, haters still [?]
Yellin' kill 'em all and I'm on ball like I'm Billups, bitch

[Verse 41: Jace]
Runnin' our heart, sit up bitch
Hard to go to sleep, all we know is work
Catch no Zs, chilled on purp
[?] came second but my bills on first
East Side nigga, still my turf
Pierce like 'Matic, hoes still at it
Swing like a batter and my crew goin' at it
Best believe that that shit gon' hurt

[Verse 42: Alexander Spit]
Toot up the French horn
The fog machine is sandstorm
Ain't go to camp
Cordless toward the performer that's keepin' your amps warm
'Fore the fans swarm
All but the limousine, swear to God that's in between
Indigo indie dream, you intervene
Yeah that's a Spit sixteen
Hearts inside of my tip jar
Like a bleeding beneath wood floor
And if every lion is purrin'
Then I'ma be certain I let my engine roar
I'm swingin' swords and swingin' chains
Singin' pure and bangin' strange
This Alexander Spit and I'm off the wall like [?]
I'm changin' lanes
Driftin' around whatever it is this game became
Like gorillas and orangutans
Go bananas and bangarang
They say I'm prayin' to that cross
For all of that fifteen minute fame
But I'ma get my [?]
And the god's here
So baby just open your bra zip
And just let them titties out
And let 'em bounce like this was Paul Revere
I'm 7.0in' on Pitchfork
I'm 10-0in' on this court
This Alexander Spit  with a pistol
[?] full of [?], I got this

[Verse 43: ScottyATL]
Better have my check, I need that first
Before I move, before I step
See I been burned it don't take long
And learn quick, it ain't no twice
I gave my time, I gave my life
So I won't bet what all I spent
I'm trying to be good, I'll take your bitch
And I ain't even playin, just ask my clique
You know my steez, trying to get real A-Town
Got that or either got sump'n to give away
Big feet on the bottom of a Chevrolet
Everybody and they mamma sell plenty hay
Need to ride with the weight scale
Propped up in the seat trying to get that
My ? on a eastside ho ?????
Tell Bron Bron we can bring the Heat back
I'm a champ, I support it
Flipping through the hundred
Cool Club with it
Running to the money
I'm in shape, I'm in shape stacking cake
Duncan Hines go get "Faith" thats my last tape
I'm on 10, I'm on fire, I'm on point, I'm on smash
Rolly on my dash, breaking down in my Cad'
I'm Atlanta, ScottyATL ho 1 space that's a Y not an IE
Slipped in ain't even check ID
Game leave me I'ma rap IV

[Verse 44: Da$h]
Year before '83, I be the kid who found ET
Tell him teach me all he know, prolly make him smoke some dope
Call a bitch over for throat and put her on some [?]
Just to get up in her brain and now she out makin' me change
I'm full of dynamite, throw her on the blade, no Wesley Snipes
Young Roxanne, baby, sell that body to the night
I'm trife as fuck, light the blunt, get high enough to die for once
[?] throw the pad at Christ, they askin' God how do I write this stuff
The Lord never liked me much, but I'm sayin', "Oh well"
Blazin' up with the devil, watchin' old Hell in the Cell
Matches your favorite actress, blastin' naked on my mattress
Polygraphs break, you say I ain't the illest nigga rappin'
The fucking  captain of this multi million dollar faction
Man didn't chief
My sons of sons'll sandwich the beef
We get loot, always scram from police
You bitch niggas lose your head if you speak
I ash the doobie off the cruise ship
And flew hash, cheffin' out of Ruth Chris
Two bitches tellin' me they do sniff
What do you know?
So much wax in this bitch, smokin'
You'd thinkin' I'm fuckin' Madame Tussauds
[?]
Nah, fuck that
Bring them [?] back
[?]
On a daily basis, sip liquor, I never chase it
[?] I'm the greatest, carve a statue of my face, bitch[Verse 1: Killer Mike]
Early morning riser reefer chiefer
You paid the most but me, I get it cheaper
Strong rapper reefer, wrap it in a big cohiba
I get so high I close my eyes and swore that I saw Jesus
I take another toke and God damn I feel comatose
I double cup and that's what's up and then I'm leaning fool
I'm talking any given Sunday, Willie Beamen ho
My bitch say that I get too high it might kill my brain
I tell her that she talk too much and she should give some brain
We used to fuck a lot but now you just fuss and complain
What a fuckin' shame, hit the door and hit the block
Avoid the walking dead, the zombies still hunt and rob
My days of wasting time, slanging dimes is way behind
I'm still tryna be a mover with a Mason's mind
I will get a mil, ain't nobody taking mine
You sorry suckers, see you saps at the finish line
You know I steady grind

[Hook: SL Jones]
I stay higher than Messiah, I ain't never grinding
You see them Jewel runners coming, but we body body
We bout that LPP we diggin' other people's pockets
Keep it cool, Run the Jewels, ain't no other way around it
I want the rings and the chains, Run the Jewels
I want the watches and the bracelets, Run the Jewels
We at the table eating everybody food
Invasion of the chain snatchers better not bust a move

[Verse 2: El-P]
I’m a dummy I’m running with more than fucking scissors
I’m the Cadillac, of fuck you, back off me you bitches
You the Cadillac of “Fuck, I just suck at this rap shit"
I’m the Cadillac of "Suck it, I’m fucking disastrous"
We the Hardy and Thom of the plant a bomb game
The lead em all to the mall and set ‘em off game
You wanna hang like Hussein
Eat a mile of my shit then put your lips to my true brain
And get the hash tag #fartnoise
I used to give a half-fuck, now I just laugh
I barely blink when it gets bad, maybe I’m crass
I pull the ducts out my eyes, I don’t cry, I just can't
Killer Mike brought the fire pack
Light it off the sinners of the city where the riots at
The living fuck boy eraser
Carve initials in the wet cement right where you died at

[Hook: SL Jones]

[Verse 3: Killer Mike]
Who wanna run a summer with the jewel runners?
Got your girlfriend hotter than two summers
Everybody tough til they see them two's on em
Then they do a number two in they True Religions
"Lord please don't shoot!", they get too religious
Truth is we go vicious on these stool pigeons
Pistol pointed at they missus like I killed these bitches
We Run the Jewels and when we talking pimpin', pay attention

[Verse 4: El-P]
Run the Jewels we a bit odd
We bad news, you barely get a fat chance to slim odds
You barely get a short plank for long walks, taught like a sawn-off
No laws when I taught, nah
And I'm kalashnikov spitting
We always take the time to smell the rose when it wither
I'd say better luck tomorrow
But the horror of your life is me and Mike are just beginningControversy sells but my talent brings the balance
I’m true to what I do that’s why I conquer every challenge
Kill em with the flow and soothe em with a ballad
All I do is win, we the best after Khaled
All I do is spin, fresh dressing at the salad
I’m the man in wonderland, Damn right I smashed Alice

Whole squad balling, my team getting cash rolls
NBA niggas: natural born assholes
Flyest niggas alive as far as swag goes
Jumping froggy out the pond, all you tadpoles
The left Levi pocket, that’s where the flag goes
I know you used to them Chevys and Cadillac doors
You’re only human you don’t recognize a spaceship
Hoes say I’m lookin different, Jonesy got a facelift

Nip/tuck flow
Shut up and suck ho
After I bust she leaves call it come and go
Get it, come and go
Man, forget it, you dumb and slow
Shorty live in my lap she giving me love alone
If you recognize real I’m familiar to y’all
Outcast of my class, I'mma chill in the hall
Kept my pistol in the bathroom under the stall
Chopped the school janitor something to leave it alone

I’m in a league of my own but never played myself
Slightly brighter than my teachers, I grade myself
Other niggas flip the script, I stayed myself
When it wasn’t my fault, I blamed myself
I take pleasure in the pain I felt
I get tougher when I suffer
That’s the way I’m built
Let my enemies live
That’s how Caine got killed
But I’m straight though cause gangsters don’t behave like them

Jonesy supposed to be a role model
Look at him standing on the couch with that rose bottle
Look at him posing for them pictures like a vogue model
Grind before you shine
What happened to that old motto?
That’s the code I know
I must be doing something right
When haters can’t believe the hype
They say you sold your soul
Couldn’t play your part
Cause you ain’t know your role
I tried to give you advice
I told you slow your roll

If we stay on this road
Then we won’t go wrong
But you got outta control
So now you on your own
Taking over the world
I wanna own the globe
They say the flow is a gift
It should have came with a bow
They say this verse is a curse
It should have came on a scroll
They left Jonesy for dead
Engraved my name on a stone
Check my background
I never back down
I’m bout my postmark
I put my stamp down

I got a special delivery especially when I reflect
No one can mirror me lyrically
You rappers will never be taken seriously
The streets been waiting
On somebody to come up out these weak imitations
Been putting in work since my first initiation
The turf really baking, the soil is boiling
Connected, no wire, I’m cordless
There’s beauty behind I write
So what I’m recording is gorgeous

It’s M.A.D.E. entertainment
The money always
Determines everything
And you know what they call me
SL Jonesy

This for the Locs with the blue flags
For the Bloods and the Black Stones
For all the Folk Nation GDs
And the People Nations Vicelords

For the jackers and the trap boys
If you gotta rob and sell dope
The judge wanna lock us up forever
Get away while you still canYikes, wow, yeah
See how this feels, Jonesy

[Verse 1]
Bangin' out a little rocks so these bitches know my name
Feds on my dick, they think I'm selling cocaine
True to the game, I'm so turnt up in this ho
Sippin' icy clean sprite, ain't no syrup off in this ho yeah
Can I get a whole check for these fuck niggas, boppin' off of my fame
Ain't gon be shit when I'm gone, wudn't shit poppin' off when I came
I'm a dope fiends dream, I got everything you crave
That's why you love me like a junkie, poking wholes in they veins I'm the man

[Hook]
Dope man dope man D-d-d-d-dope man
Dope man dope man D-d-d-d-dope man
Dope man dope man D-d-d-d-dope man
Dope man dope man dope man

[Verse 2]
Dope man dope man, straight glass no coke pan
Frosted Flakes no Oat Bran, self made no spokesman
From the ground up no floor plans, snap-back jordans
High tops flip flops, wrap it up get shot
Great shape I'm in tip top, I ain't said shit my lips locked
Draped up dripped out, Nina with me that bitch cocked
Fifth locked in that fall spyder, no love I got hard problems
Night rider that car talk, transform and that car walk
Look at what I'm doing, looking for the chewing
These hoes on my dick like its made out of Louis yikes
Crowd surfin' in an ocean full of wavy bitches
I got my locs on, I don't see them shady bitches
I got the cut sewn up, no stitches
Call me mug shot shawty, cuz the feds taking pictures
Cup full of mud but ain't no dirt off in my swisha
Yeah my last name Jonesy, don't forget to add the mister I'm the man

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Fifty eleven hundreds in a dope boy knot
Pink Pyrex, that's a coke boy pot
Your money lookin' funny, you a joke boy stop
Don't be playing with my time, like no broke toy clock
Coolin', bad bitches choosin'
You want to download my wave, swag not included
Break it down sack it up, trap it out and move it
Making plays and hittin' licks to making cash off of music call it evolution
Back to the old me, throw away strap and an Oz
I'm 'bout that I'm 'bout that, in the kitchen bringing that ounce back
Whole thang half price, correct change my swag right
Fresh to death in my past life, with a beige babe she half white
Fast life slow grind, my hustle mean but I'm so kind
You hella suck blow job, my temper short it's like 4'9"
Pica-boo in that dope ride, its ghost white poltergeist
Creep up on you like yikes, broad day light flashin' my brights I'm the man

[Hook]Intro:
I'm saying that I'm sorry
For all your pain
You know who I'm talking to
I ain't gotta say no names
This is my apology
The one that you deserved and never got from me
I still ride you
You did a lot for me
I hope that you can find it in your heart to forgive me

Reminiscing bout those days on Dick Jeter Road
Mama used to heat the whole house with the kitchen stove
Me and my youngest brother
Peas from the same pod
Dealt the same hand
So we had to play the same cards

What set you claiming?
Wasn't easy to accept you banging
I still remember Uncle Raymond saying "Nephews changing"
Niggas fear him in the hood cause his rep is dangerous
Why bother rapping when trapping can make you just as famous?

Respected young with a reckless tongue
I would give you the last breath in this set of lungs
Papa taught us street smarts
We were never dumb
You were raised to be a rider
Trained to never run

How could you be a better son to your mother
When your older brother wasn't really there
To show you how much he loved you?
Charge it to my mind and not my heart
I regret it
I hope that my apology's accepted
Forgive me

Chorus
I wish that I could tell you it's gon be alright
I wish that I could say that it's gon be ok
I hope you can forgive me as the days go by
I'll regret it for the rest of my life
I'll regret it, for the rest of my life

Reminiscing bout them days when we got along
A small pause while I recall how we got involved
Oh I remember
I just wanted to get in them drawers
I'm far from perfect
But you never seem to see my flaws

Never did you wrong
I always had the best intentions
You just needed attention
But I was out here grinding like a blender
Two completely different agendas
We tried to make it work
Hoping time would heal where it hurt
It kinda made it worse

You want a loving husband and a couple of kids
I just want a bunch of money and a couple of cribs
You pictured having a beautiful wedding, family and friends
I pictured having a candy blue chevy, ridin on rims
You the type to settle down and be a man's wife
I'm the type to stray away from commitment
Addicted to the fast life
Charge it to my mind and not my heart
I regret it
I hope that my apology's accepted
Forgive me

Chorus

Live with regrets
Forgive and forget
I ask for guidance in my prayers
I sin and repent
Still reminisce
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
If I knew then what I know now
I'd still be half as wise

I laugh sometimes to keep from crying
When there's no denying
What you're implying
I remain silent to keep from lying
I'm not being biased when I cater to the flyest
Some people too broke to get it
But you just too cheap to buy it

You know you're making noise when your haters can't be quiet
And every public relation seems to lead to something private
My sister's blowing up my phone to see whats up with Brian
It happened as if I planned it
I'm just really improvising
Expected not to win
That's why I tell it like it is
All my little cousins big and my mama want some grandkids
I know this sounds kinda selfish
But if I don't help myself
Im gon be helpless
My sincere apologies
I hope you accept it[Verse 1: Mookie Jones]
Size 12, just to kill the roaches
Misses know my guys well, pluto never on no ho shit
Autoooo fly as hell, shaking hands with the owners
All the numbers in my cell, I'm probably fucking your bitch
Notice boar it in half the glass get warm
I got plugs with Osama, Al-Queda ain't got the best bomb
Check it I could do this shit with my left arm always armed
To a charm so a players chest wrapped in Teflon singing

[Hook]
I'm in grindmode a player stay working hard
You know how fast time goes when you keep it on your job
Respect my mind though we making moves like the mob
Mackin' fine hoes maxing credit cards
(Repeat)

[Verse 2: SL Jones]
Don't fill my cup too high, give that Bombay room to breathe
Graduated from the streets, always put trap yay by degrees
I be working on my masters, read a lick just like a chapter
I was raised by Cadillacers, and Chevrolets the league
Of extraordinary players, I was drafted at an early age
Fully loaded candy coated sitting on them twirly thangs
Gorgeous babe scratching niggas, baby face attractive killers
Crawling like a caterpillar, swangin' swervin' turn up turn up
The block dry no chap stick, skinny jeans but them racks fit
Country boy no accent, skinny bitch on my fat eghh
She like it I love it, she fit right in my budget
I call it public aggression when we be fighting in public
I'm her underground king, she my Harriet Tubman
Jonzie shinning on these boys, you would think lightning strucken
Known for moving with a gang way cooler with the slang
Swag drippin' everywhere, police couldn't remove the stains mayne

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mookie Jones]
As I stroll between the states, 'bout to catch a wave
Yeah my flow between the lakes, getting blown at a home
Eating Kobe clean steak, like homes in the zone jones
Kobe ring eight, from paper plates to paper plates
Mama I told you we'd be straight
Roll another eighth, crack another case
Open up the safe, I'm 'bout to pack another place
Jonzie in your face like acne at a rapid rate
That plastic don't make you fake, word to the ratchet on my waist
??? shit happen word to fate
Its that fast life living, we ain't trying to hit the brakes
Drive that murder burger until small fries get the shake
We value meals young artists without a deal
In a war we decide you got to kill but
P.A.N.'s don't die, we just regroup and rebuild
In a field for the trill, them shoes seen and filled

[Hook][Verse 1: Killer Mike]
Early morning riser reefer chiefer
You paid the most but me, I get it cheaper
Strong rapper reefer, wrap it in a big cohiba
I get so high I close my eyes and swore that I saw Jesus
I take another toke and God damn I feel comatose
I double cup and that's what's up and then I'm leaning fool
I'm talking any given Sunday, Willie Beamen ho
My bitch say that I get too high it might kill my brain
I tell her that she talk too much and she should give some brain
We used to fuck a lot but now you just fuss and complain
What a fuckin' shame, hit the door and hit the block
Avoid the walking dead, the zombies still hunt and rob
My days of wasting time, slanging dimes is way behind
I'm still tryna be a mover with a Mason's mind
I will get a mil, ain't nobody taking mine
You sorry suckers, see you saps at the finish line
You know I steady grind

[Hook: SL Jones]
I stay higher than Messiah, I ain't never grinding
You see them Jewel runners coming, but we body body
We bout that LPP we diggin' other people's pockets
Keep it cool, Run the Jewels, ain't no other way around it
I want the rings and the chains, Run the Jewels
I want the watches and the bracelets, Run the Jewels
We at the table eating everybody food
Invasion of the chain snatchers better not bust a move

[Verse 2: El-P]
I’m a dummy I’m running with more than fucking scissors
I’m the Cadillac, of fuck you, back off me you bitches
You the Cadillac of “Fuck, I just suck at this rap shit"
I’m the Cadillac of "Suck it, I’m fucking disastrous"
We the Hardy and Thom of the plant a bomb game
The lead em all to the mall and set ‘em off game
You wanna hang like Hussein
Eat a mile of my shit then put your lips to my true brain
And get the hash tag #fartnoise
I used to give a half-fuck, now I just laugh
I barely blink when it gets bad, maybe I’m crass
I pull the ducts out my eyes, I don’t cry, I just can't
Killer Mike brought the fire pack
Light it off the sinners of the city where the riots at
The living fuck boy eraser
Carve initials in the wet cement right where you died at

[Hook: SL Jones]

[Verse 3: Killer Mike]
Who wanna run a summer with the jewel runners?
Got your girlfriend hotter than two summers
Everybody tough til they see them two's on em
Then they do a number two in they True Religions
"Lord please don't shoot!", they get too religious
Truth is we go vicious on these stool pigeons
Pistol pointed at they missus like I killed these bitches
We Run the Jewels and when we talking pimpin', pay attention

[Verse 4: El-P]
Run the Jewels we a bit odd
We bad news, you barely get a fat chance to slim odds
You barely get a short plank for long walks, taught like a sawn-off
No laws when I taught, nah
And I'm kalashnikov spitting
We always take the time to smell the rose when it wither
I'd say better luck tomorrow
But the horror of your life is me and Mike are just beginningYikes, wow, yeah
See how this feels, Jonesy

[Verse 1]
Bangin' out a little rocks so these bitches know my name
Feds on my dick, they think I'm selling cocaine
True to the game, I'm so turnt up in this ho
Sippin' icy clean sprite, ain't no syrup off in this ho yeah
Can I get a whole check for these fuck niggas, boppin' off of my fame
Ain't gon be shit when I'm gone, wudn't shit poppin' off when I came
I'm a dope fiends dream, I got everything you crave
That's why you love me like a junkie, poking wholes in they veins I'm the man

[Hook]
Dope man dope man D-d-d-d-dope man
Dope man dope man D-d-d-d-dope man
Dope man dope man D-d-d-d-dope man
Dope man dope man dope man

[Verse 2]
Dope man dope man, straight glass no coke pan
Frosted Flakes no Oat Bran, self made no spokesman
From the ground up no floor plans, snap-back jordans
High tops flip flops, wrap it up get shot
Great shape I'm in tip top, I ain't said shit my lips locked
Draped up dripped out, Nina with me that bitch cocked
Fifth locked in that fall spyder, no love I got hard problems
Night rider that car talk, transform and that car walk
Look at what I'm doing, looking for the chewing
These hoes on my dick like its made out of Louis yikes
Crowd surfin' in an ocean full of wavy bitches
I got my locs on, I don't see them shady bitches
I got the cut sewn up, no stitches
Call me mug shot shawty, cuz the feds taking pictures
Cup full of mud but ain't no dirt off in my swisha
Yeah my last name Jonesy, don't forget to add the mister I'm the man

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Fifty eleven hundreds in a dope boy knot
Pink Pyrex, that's a coke boy pot
Your money lookin' funny, you a joke boy stop
Don't be playing with my time, like no broke toy clock
Coolin', bad bitches choosin'
You want to download my wave, swag not included
Break it down sack it up, trap it out and move it
Making plays and hittin' licks to making cash off of music call it evolution
Back to the old me, throw away strap and an Oz
I'm 'bout that I'm 'bout that, in the kitchen bringing that ounce back
Whole thang half price, correct change my swag right
Fresh to death in my past life, with a beige babe she half white
Fast life slow grind, my hustle mean but I'm so kind
You hella suck blow job, my temper short it's like 4'9"
Pica-boo in that dope ride, its ghost white poltergeist
Creep up on you like yikes, broad day light flashin' my brights I'm the man

[Hook]Controversy sells but my talent brings the balance
I’m true to what I do that’s why I conquer every challenge
Kill em with the flow and soothe em with a ballad
All I do is win, we the best after Khaled
All I do is spin, fresh dressing at the salad
I’m the man in wonderland, Damn right I smashed Alice

Whole squad balling, my team getting cash rolls
NBA niggas: natural born assholes
Flyest niggas alive as far as swag goes
Jumping froggy out the pond, all you tadpoles
The left Levi pocket, that’s where the flag goes
I know you used to them Chevys and Cadillac doors
You’re only human you don’t recognize a spaceship
Hoes say I’m lookin different, Jonesy got a facelift

Nip/tuck flow
Shut up and suck ho
After I bust she leaves call it come and go
Get it, come and go
Man, forget it, you dumb and slow
Shorty live in my lap she giving me love alone
If you recognize real I’m familiar to y’all
Outcast of my class, I'mma chill in the hall
Kept my pistol in the bathroom under the stall
Chopped the school janitor something to leave it alone

I’m in a league of my own but never played myself
Slightly brighter than my teachers, I grade myself
Other niggas flip the script, I stayed myself
When it wasn’t my fault, I blamed myself
I take pleasure in the pain I felt
I get tougher when I suffer
That’s the way I’m built
Let my enemies live
That’s how Caine got killed
But I’m straight though cause gangsters don’t behave like them

Jonesy supposed to be a role model
Look at him standing on the couch with that rose bottle
Look at him posing for them pictures like a vogue model
Grind before you shine
What happened to that old motto?
That’s the code I know
I must be doing something right
When haters can’t believe the hype
They say you sold your soul
Couldn’t play your part
Cause you ain’t know your role
I tried to give you advice
I told you slow your roll

If we stay on this road
Then we won’t go wrong
But you got outta control
So now you on your own
Taking over the world
I wanna own the globe
They say the flow is a gift
It should have came with a bow
They say this verse is a curse
It should have came on a scroll
They left Jonesy for dead
Engraved my name on a stone
Check my background
I never back down
I’m bout my postmark
I put my stamp down

I got a special delivery especially when I reflect
No one can mirror me lyrically
You rappers will never be taken seriously
The streets been waiting
On somebody to come up out these weak imitations
Been putting in work since my first initiation
The turf really baking, the soil is boiling
Connected, no wire, I’m cordless
There’s beauty behind I write
So what I’m recording is gorgeous

It’s M.A.D.E. entertainment
The money always
Determines everything
And you know what they call me
SL Jonesy

This for the Locs with the blue flags
For the Bloods and the Black Stones
For all the Folk Nation GDs
And the People Nations Vicelords

For the jackers and the trap boys
If you gotta rob and sell dope
The judge wanna lock us up forever
Get away while you still can[Verse 1: Mookie Jones]
Size 12, just to kill the roaches
Misses know my guys well, pluto never on no ho shit
Autoooo fly as hell, shaking hands with the owners
All the numbers in my cell, I'm probably fucking your bitch
Notice boar it in half the glass get warm
I got plugs with Osama, Al-Queda ain't got the best bomb
Check it I could do this shit with my left arm always armed
To a charm so a players chest wrapped in Teflon singing

[Hook]
I'm in grindmode a player stay working hard
You know how fast time goes when you keep it on your job
Respect my mind though we making moves like the mob
Mackin' fine hoes maxing credit cards
(Repeat)

[Verse 2: SL Jones]
Don't fill my cup too high, give that Bombay room to breathe
Graduated from the streets, always put trap yay by degrees
I be working on my masters, read a lick just like a chapter
I was raised by Cadillacers, and Chevrolets the league
Of extraordinary players, I was drafted at an early age
Fully loaded candy coated sitting on them twirly thangs
Gorgeous babe scratching niggas, baby face attractive killers
Crawling like a caterpillar, swangin' swervin' turn up turn up
The block dry no chap stick, skinny jeans but them racks fit
Country boy no accent, skinny bitch on my fat eghh
She like it I love it, she fit right in my budget
I call it public aggression when we be fighting in public
I'm her underground king, she my Harriet Tubman
Jonzie shinning on these boys, you would think lightning strucken
Known for moving with a gang way cooler with the slang
Swag drippin' everywhere, police couldn't remove the stains mayne

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mookie Jones]
As I stroll between the states, 'bout to catch a wave
Yeah my flow between the lakes, getting blown at a home
Eating Kobe clean steak, like homes in the zone jones
Kobe ring eight, from paper plates to paper plates
Mama I told you we'd be straight
Roll another eighth, crack another case
Open up the safe, I'm 'bout to pack another place
Jonzie in your face like acne at a rapid rate
That plastic don't make you fake, word to the ratchet on my waist
??? shit happen word to fate
Its that fast life living, we ain't trying to hit the brakes
Drive that murder burger until small fries get the shake
We value meals young artists without a deal
In a war we decide you got to kill but
P.A.N.'s don't die, we just regroup and rebuild
In a field for the trill, them shoes seen and filled

[Hook]Intro:
I'm saying that I'm sorry
For all your pain
You know who I'm talking to
I ain't gotta say no names
This is my apology
The one that you deserved and never got from me
I still ride you
You did a lot for me
I hope that you can find it in your heart to forgive me

Reminiscing bout those days on Dick Jeter Road
Mama used to heat the whole house with the kitchen stove
Me and my youngest brother
Peas from the same pod
Dealt the same hand
So we had to play the same cards

What set you claiming?
Wasn't easy to accept you banging
I still remember Uncle Raymond saying "Nephews changing"
Niggas fear him in the hood cause his rep is dangerous
Why bother rapping when trapping can make you just as famous?

Respected young with a reckless tongue
I would give you the last breath in this set of lungs
Papa taught us street smarts
We were never dumb
You were raised to be a rider
Trained to never run

How could you be a better son to your mother
When your older brother wasn't really there
To show you how much he loved you?
Charge it to my mind and not my heart
I regret it
I hope that my apology's accepted
Forgive me

Chorus
I wish that I could tell you it's gon be alright
I wish that I could say that it's gon be ok
I hope you can forgive me as the days go by
I'll regret it for the rest of my life
I'll regret it, for the rest of my life

Reminiscing bout them days when we got along
A small pause while I recall how we got involved
Oh I remember
I just wanted to get in them drawers
I'm far from perfect
But you never seem to see my flaws

Never did you wrong
I always had the best intentions
You just needed attention
But I was out here grinding like a blender
Two completely different agendas
We tried to make it work
Hoping time would heal where it hurt
It kinda made it worse

You want a loving husband and a couple of kids
I just want a bunch of money and a couple of cribs
You pictured having a beautiful wedding, family and friends
I pictured having a candy blue chevy, ridin on rims
You the type to settle down and be a man's wife
I'm the type to stray away from commitment
Addicted to the fast life
Charge it to my mind and not my heart
I regret it
I hope that my apology's accepted
Forgive me

Chorus

Live with regrets
Forgive and forget
I ask for guidance in my prayers
I sin and repent
Still reminisce
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
If I knew then what I know now
I'd still be half as wise

I laugh sometimes to keep from crying
When there's no denying
What you're implying
I remain silent to keep from lying
I'm not being biased when I cater to the flyest
Some people too broke to get it
But you just too cheap to buy it

You know you're making noise when your haters can't be quiet
And every public relation seems to lead to something private
My sister's blowing up my phone to see whats up with Brian
It happened as if I planned it
I'm just really improvising
Expected not to win
That's why I tell it like it is
All my little cousins big and my mama want some grandkids
I know this sounds kinda selfish
But if I don't help myself
Im gon be helpless
My sincere apologies
I hope you accept it[Verse 1: Pusha T]
They think that they know, something 'bout my life
Not in the same class, not on the same flight
Maybe the same club, just not the same lights
Both fucked the same bitch, just not the same night
You just took her phone number
I just took her home with a-
'Nother bitch, ménage
Boomerang, Strange'
Lipstick on my collar, Oscar de la renta(y)
Your hijo - pequeño, my nachos - bel grande
Stay sippin' that André
Spent 3 stacks - that's André
That Balmain, that Phillip Lim
They say I'm dressing like Kanye
I'm everything that my rhymes say:
Breadwinner, brand owner
Play Cloths, millionaire
Trendsetter, landowner
Hope your bitch don't land on him
Drink in his hand with the sand on him
You small time - you Hyundai's
Y'all couch niggas - we stand on em
Dope money with a band on it
Half gold, we got a hand on it
D-boys still ball the same
Just gotta little bit of glam on it
YAH!

[Verse 2: Bryant Dope]
I got flames for your download link
I let Ja Rule when I murder ink
Murder pink, murder what you thought and what you think
This Queens prodigy is the product of what you ain't
Well packaged to distribute to the masters
Plotted this since first grade classes
Class is elements of a classic
I've got evidence of a master
You never thought you'd be bodied by a bastard
A bachelor who backspin on breakbeats
Break necks of broke souls who hate me
Hate he? You can't take my heat
Fireball flow, can't bat in my league
I'm the best rapper that's been slept on
Stick around like gum that's been stepped on
Stepped on, I stepped up, so what up?
Tryna make bread with these damn cold cuts
I cold crush every beat that I touch
My words silk and my flow is pure plush
Tell HudMo Dope says "what's up?"

[Verse 3: Go Dreamer]
Go Dreamer's a [?], wish upon a star
I'm too cold for Pluto so I'm movin' back to Mars
Cause this that spaceship, that space shit
This that category 5, this that quake, bitch, that quake, bitch
See I'm so funked out, like out of here
Like blue lights in the basement
And it's a red state, in Georgia with it
Last verse, did you get it? Nah
Never mind, just throw that cash in a duffle
As I'm on my Hollywood shuffle
Eatin' your million dollar truffles, this acquirin' taste
Tantalise so you can see the bigger picture that God is the light
In the fixture or in the background
Cut all the hatin' in the background
Cause if music and money is the motive then you're so gimmick
Who's to tell me I can't have a trillion dollar grilled cheese sandwich?
Boy stop playin', stop playin'
I'm just sayin', just sayin'
Now who else wanna fuck with Hollyweird Go?

[Verse 4: Retch]
Break up and roll it, light it and smoke it
Pass it, don't hold it, lovin' that potent
I'm drunk and I'm rollin', it still got me goin'
These bad hoes is gruntin', their booties is pokin'
Out them little dresses, a nigga wanna fuck
He don't even smoke but tell Butter roll a blunt
Cause I'm way too drunk and I'm too turnt up
And I brought my own shit and I do my own stunts
Young and I'm wildin', new drugs, I try em
He'll call me Retch but your bitch call me Bryan
In Polo I'm stylin', it's all that I'm rockin'
If you catch me out in 'Lo it's a problem
'Less it's a Champion suit, then I'm draggin'
Fuck with me, I got all this 'Lo all from raggin'?
Used to have a nigga that was down to get to clappin'
Seen it on a video, he yappin' to the captain
That nigga snitchin', R86 him
These niggas trainers cause these niggas switchin'
And these niggas bitchin' more than these bitches
And I'm just so sick of this shit, it's ridiculous
Middle finger to the feds, [?] all day
Take her out to eat then I make a bitch pay
And my wine [?] and my shrimps sautéed
And I'm chillin' in LA with a bitch for the day

[Verse 5: Nipsey Hussle]
Ain't that a bitch?
Foot up on the gas, ain't no brakes in this bitch
Cover girl givin' face to the Crip
Somethin' 'bout a nigga on the way to the chips
High off the money and I'm wasted as shit
High off the life and she can't get a grip
Hundred dollar cup and you can't get a sip
I'm a million dollar nigga, you should take you a flick
Hundred thousand dollar car where I sit
And my broad is the shit
Crenshaw in the 6
Got it parked at the Shell in front of all of the Crips
You either ball or you brick
She don't know money so she callin' you rich
You ain't got game so you fall for the shit
Spend it all in this bitch 'til it's gone and she split
Now you feel like a wimp
Talkin' 'bout what you was buildin' and shit
Got you all up in your feelings and shit
Problem is, she addicted to the real nigga shit
To the real nigga shit
50 dollar, hundred dollar bill shit
Gold crown on a real nigga wrist
Fresh like my nephew Khalil in this bitch
.40 cal, no concealing the shit
4 gun cases, I'm still with this shit
Backlit, wood wheel when I whip
Got her right up on my lap, that's a real nigga risk
In the field on my tip
Hoes like Phil then I Stockton assist
It ain't no stoppin' shit
Avoid the potholes, put stocks on the 6

[Verse 6: Problem]
Got Mary blowing Jane
We fucking high, sex on a plane
Hey newscaster, we about to reign
Loving the club because we fill the section with pain, c'mon
Blow him up, finna explode
All of hell's kitchen praying he don't stick from the stove
God got me, illum-i-not-me written in bold
Slept on, now I'm everywhere like g-g-g-go crazy
'Bout 150
Let me tell y'all now, I want Nicki
Lift her up high up like helicopter far away from her fellow
Let her play problem
While problem tongue play with propeller (what)
Keep fresh just in margielas
Diamond lane running thangs ain't shit you can tell us (don't tell us nothing)
Done everything, ain't shit you can sell us
Money over bullshit, friction derail us (naw)
[?] niggas, yeah we take it or leave it
But know it's over since I was [?]
You nervous like I thought you seen [?]
Got everybody thanking me
[?]
I'm a boss [?]
[?]
[?]
Cause I'm a mad man
Fuck niggas like the Klan, man
Put you to sleep like the sandman
Give me the throne, I'm a chairman (diamond)
Rolex beat, it's time for just winning, no fakes
Just copped more 45's and 9s, I ain't talking bout no J's
Please be afraid but I ain't the shooter
[?]
Riding shotty in the chevy [?] know as a Krueger
Lyrical Ruger, pop your medulla
You lukewarm, boy, go get you a cooler please
Your bitch know that I'm cooler, please
Your bitch know that I'm cooler, please
So cool I could fucking die if I drop a few degrees
Boss daddy used to call the police
Get it good girl, use your knees
I love them brainiacs
Yeah, my last ho had a few degrees (for real)
Back on my Compton shit
Demonic how I demolish shit
Angelic with my intuition
Student of game make hoes pay tuition (huh)
No dice, no pill, but I'm on a roll
That one nigga that Kendrick can't control (what)
Problem

[Verse 7: Danny Brown]
(CHECK!)
That Ambien in my ink pen
Move the brown squares like Wheat Thins
Y'all five days and a weekend
Stay smokin' on that defense
That's 2 or 3 and I'm zonin'
Got money like I cloned it
Your bitch came through and I owned it
Rims on the Caddy and I ice-cream coned it
Homie, you ain't hitting on nothin'
Drop that top when I hit that button
Pimp so hard it's a full time job
Swear, 12 stacks in my glove box
Bitch niggas, tell me what it's gon' be
Young nigga chop it up 223
Come to the D, don't hit OGs
And my advice is stay low-key
Bitch we great, bitch we great, fuckin' set
Bitch we jump up, bitch we jump up, we gotta have it
Gotta get it, we gotta get it, we gonna take it
Bitch we jump, say bitch we jump, we gotta make it
Couple racks up on them [?]
Your bitch here smoked my trippy stick
Ridiculous, put dick on tit, spit on clit
And it's over with, I'm over it
No sober shit, drink til I just throw up and shit
Y'all ho told me come over here
So guess what nigga it's over with
And it's over with

[Verse 8: Meyhem Lauren]
Fresh out the wave pool, my niggas made cool
We wrote the blueprint for the shit y'all niggas try to do
If I'm not outside, then I'm probably inside your boo
My team's official, you ain't shit, that's why she's trying my crew
Pardon me, I move retardedly
This shit is old to me, the real New York is part of me
I'm always shopping, keep it fly, Lauren is archery
Don't get it twisted, realistic, I could part the sea
My life is fast, I take a chance when I insert the key
And then I turn it up, that's really how you work the V
Your stash ain't never dry if you getting your work from me
We do this fly shit perfectly, we're enough to rise the mercury
Heat nigga, street nigga
Reflect those both when I be rapping on the beat, nigga
Looking Cambodian while standing at the podium
My flow was opium, we cock bottles and open them
Laurenovich

[Verse 9: Raekwon]
Stop by, tryna see a nigga
All I buy is these trees, king
100 ki's in them streets, nigga
Mask me up in grease
Sneaker game is lethal
N.Y., them eagles
Fly through, get high too
Fly as hell, might as well
Hire you the live group
Come through with that live crew
Birds chirpin', cop that Birkin
Boo, yo, I supplied you
Liable to be in Beirut, no Beirut, this debut
Slick, little niggas get gun pounding
Keep moving, who saved you?
Play who? Not me
Me and Bronson, not we
Two real niggas sitting in the East Coast
Ice is on, heat close
Fuck around and kill one of y'all clown ass niggas, word up
Take your two, take your hat
Take a nap, put your ass ton the ground, little niggas
We pound niggas and drown niggas and
Hemmied up,  that brown, niggas
All my niggas get stemi'd up
Hennessy, Louie V
Me and you, me and her
We as one and she is done
Battle rap me three to one
Freedom after, kingdom come

[Verse 10: Vado]
Triple hundred K in my duffle
Give a hundred K to my muscle
Slept a hundred days, just wakin' up
Need a brick, just break it up
Break it down, then take the cut
We shave around like a taper cut
I weigh the pound, if you hatin' us
'Bout to paint the town, most hated what
Most hated what
Grab the dice then shake 'em up
Talked hundreds since 8 and up
You lost the onions, no makin' up
No blunts but y'all fake as fuck
It's gym time and I'm shapin' up
I've been foulin', when Blake get up
You gon' waste a life, you need to hang it up
Dreams, click clack
Man down with that chrome Uz'
On his back like "nigga don't move"
Word to mother, we don't lose
Talk [?] like we don't move
See Gutter, be home soon
See Gutter, he'll be home soon

[Bridge: Vado] x2
What's good? Talk the money, what's good?
Haters frontin', what's good?
I'm pullin' up like, "What's good?"
You know I got it, what's good?
My people's 'bout it, what's good?
Never stop, we never settle
Gotta push the pedal in that hood

[Verse 11: Kilo Kish]
I sit in the back of the room
Legs crossed, melting wax
Another free drink so soon?
All good, knock it back
Red lights, heart attack
Just a dream with no end in sight
Waking up to evening
Now it seems I live this rotten life
Spoiled rotten life, frozen hair with burning hands
Coming out to dance with other drones who couldn't give a damn
But when the night calls
Redcurrant lipstick with the lights off
Look at all the bottles lined up
Wondering who they could pop for
Golden ember to the black floor
Burning monks to [?]
Part of the action
Retweet, now you're the attraction
Sit around and watch them
Watch their faces and reactions
Then blur the lines until the sun
Is back on your horizon

[Verse 12: Juice]
Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe
Inhale, potent marijuana running shit like the mayor
Rap game Peter Parker web swinging through the air
My minds in the clouds and I ain't got a beer
See I ain't got a care kill them now and reap the benefits
Coldest nigga out and I ain't sold no fucking disc
Henny bottle-eater, 3 grams in the fuckin' spliff
Call it what you want I'm a zombie bitch I'm off this shit

[Verse 13: Erick Arc Elliott]
Yo prada never gonna pile up
If you can't follow this game, nigga
My team smoking that green
If you ain't seen me then you must be a lame, nigga
And I'll give you three shots hold this heat down
Shorty pussy so wet she could soak a beach towel
But meanwhile, Effortless, so she thought it was a freestyle
Everybody wanna floss like a G now
What about me? Never had a bitch nigga doubt me
Zombie gang all y'all niggas pace is shit
On some basic shit it's no wonder that you sound the same
So forever am I living staying out of prison
Mommy told me different but these hoes don't hear it
Forever am I living staying out of prison
Mommy told me different but these hoes don't hear it

[Verse 14: Meech]
I heard life's a bitch so I spit and stimulate her clit
Hitting licks Henny shots hitting licks on the ave
Hitting licks who is this? that be Meech
Zombie walking casualty beat the beat till it's actually fragments
Coke off her areola and no not a can of soda
Tearing flesh pussy pink look like Cam's Range Rover
No High school diploma but baby I'm a street soulja
School of the hard knocks every class I leap over
Smith and Wesson .500, long nose, mazel tov
Shoot a man who squeal then I peel like an old cut
Like my women heightened and not even trying
And if she leaky leaky then Meechy gon' dive in
Ha, mic check check me, skin darker than Wesley
Two-eighths of shrooms got me dancing like Mr. Bentley
Mind yo' fuckin' business, why you think the whip is tinted?
The darkest nigga in it sparking up to infinite

[Verse 15: Renegade El Rey]
Renegade, nigga let's get it straight from the gate
I'ma tell you what it is, I'ma tell you what it ain't
See you ain't gotta question
Or better yet second guess anything that I might say
You see not a single syllable is out of place
I rock a venue, people barely know my name
What I'm tryna tell you is I ain't gotta tell you a fuckin' thing
I'ma show so you know
Niggas either do or they don't
And bein' number two is what I won't be
I'm silencin' lambs and sheep, don't sleep
Cause my characteristics are that of a cannibal
Call this shit Hannibal Lector
My timing's impeccable, sharp like a razorblade
And you look dissectible
I've been on my mind for days
Cause homie we've been in the grind for years
Southern eagle nigga, fuck 'em all mane, we don't fly in fear
I grew up in the city where they figured they can kill dreams when they kill king
To get their shot, [?]
I stay strapped, fuck you mean?
'Bout my green, I need bread, I'm like "Fuck the rest"
When I need bread, I'm like "Fuck the rest"
I be up all night tryna chase the check
Prolly spent it fast, I need to make it back
M.E.M.P.H.I.S, they could never stop me
Check these lames and pimp this game
Let's put it in my pocket

[Verse 16: Rockie Fresh]
And they will never know 'bout all the nights that we prayed
All the meetings we took, and all the records we played
I tried to tell 'em I'm the shit, but they told us, "no way"
With no cuts, they're like a barber, they're about to catch fade
My number one rule is that I gotta get paid
I've been thinkin' this way since I was in the 6th grade
No English, I ain't talk, but boy could add
In the school of hard knocks I'm a fuckin' grad
In these Pumas I'ma run shit, high so I'm above shit
Lame ass niggas I don't fuck with
Bathing Ape trucker, I'm a fly mothafucka
My team lookin' at me like every time it's supper
Cause they know I'm gon' feed 'em, Rocky been a boss
I ain't worried 'bout the price cause I can clearly pay the cost
I'm the sharpest guy around and I'ma always cut my loss
Then come back for the win, I'ma make it, then I spin

[Verse 17: Pill]
Real west side nigga, [?]
Might pull the piece, somebody call a Buddhist
[?] put me high [?]
You can do that, flyin', fuck, do this
And yeah I'm from the slimiest place where the bombs are pacin'
Niggas call me Jason when the guns are chasin'
Might hit 'em with the TEC, yeah the foul is flagrant
You be on [?]
Hand in the bowl when your hand really cold
Work the light in the day shift
I don't really give a fuck as long as I get paid shift
New Cadillac, chopper, no new blade shit
I go crazy on this beat right now
I really gotta go and spit heat right now
Don't matter what the fuck it's prada
Well fitting suits eating on clam chowder
Knock it out the park like Eric Estrada
Remember I was shoppin' at Family Dollar
Got your main bitch Facebookin', beggin' for a swallow
Pop this pill then I pop my collar
Park this shit then I toss a couple dollars
Instagram, gon' post for some follows
I've been in and out my zone if you really wanna know
I got Hen and got Patron if you're really tryna go

[Verse 18: Bodega Bamz]
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
I'm what the music game need
Like Rich when he just came home
And then gave the keys to a cherry 3 Series
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
Fucker, that AK go chopped
7:30 my time, I'm on psychiatric watch
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
Show and prove for what?
I got XXL mula, I got bitches tryna get fucked
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
Now you're dead, pussy boy catch up
Pool junkie rack up, nigga, act up
Trunk with the mac truck bulletproof'ed up
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
Double parked on murder lane
187 my address, Boulevard of pain
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
My cellphone backed up
My clientele meet once
No voice mail, just call me up, uh
646 684 011 011
Hit me up when you want that coke
Hit me up when you want more drugs
646 684 011 011
Hit me up when you want that coke
Hit me up when you want more drugs

[Verse 19: Remy Banks]
As I sit back and roll up this black demeanor
Reminiscing on my past, still dreaming about that Beamer
Shit, I never was that kid in the streets gripping on Nina's
Instead, I was that nigga puffin reefer, fucking lolitas
With the baddest features
Dog 'em then it's onto the next like I do my sneakers
That was the life I was living, careless about their feelings
Caught cheating, ask for forgiveness, of course I got my way
But now I'm older and wiser, cruising through summer days
With a little Ma riding in the passenger, she rolling up that lavender
Purple cannabis rapture, head high like a Jersey in the rafters
You wing a Frazier, some smart players until we major
Traveling the world, collecting paper, pissing off these haters
Come back home and invest in something then ball out later
In five star restaurants high as hell when I tip my waiter
Providing for my seed when I bring one in this world
But until that day gets here I'm thinking about these joints, twerk

[Verse 20: Killer Mike]
Lord have mercy
I'm so motherfucking fresh to death, better call my hearse
My hearse a 72442 with an all wood wheel and that bitch'll vert
My Oldmobile is a cold mobile
Got a cold, young chick down in Mobile
My stacks so fat can't even hold that
Fold that, lay flat like I lack no wheel
Lay flat like I lack no wheels for real
A nigga had to cold the corner, move crack for real
Move crack for real, no rap shit
But I rap rap shit, my rap shit for real
So you rapping ass rabbit ass ratchet ass niggas
Gotta listen to these raps for real
Cuz, I don't give a fuck if you a Blood or a cuz
Cause I draw blood for real
Tryna hang in my city, tryna see a bitch titty, no pity
Nigga, you'll get hit for real
These maggot ass hoes ain't hit on shit
They'll set you up for the loot shit, man
Thinking that's your bitch, better have your shit
Better have quick hands like Gucci Mane
Niggas tryna get a brick of Kathy Lee Gifford
Better be strapped like Clifford
It's the big, black nigga then drip of the big black pistol
I suggest you confess where you keeping all the money, mister
At the work she see a hearse
But at the best he just will pistol whip ya
Get to see you child and live
Lord have mercy, please forgive 'em, gone

[Verse 21: Del Harris]
Young Del God is handsome
Your girl, she's on ransom
She don't wanna come back
Cause you don't make her cum
On the beats I do go dumb
And I do her till she numb
And I make her soaking wet when she grab that water gun
Now fuck that brag rap, man
I'm Batman, I'm Bruce Wayne
I'm kickin' it, I'm Liu Kang
I'm killing these niggas, they're too lame
Unorthodox, they too tame
I'm right hand but play left
I'll chop a trend down 'til there ain't no more plain left
Now pay respect to them gods, niggas
Not talkin' church, I'm talkin' rides niggas
On boulevards when we ride
Hovercrafts cause we fly
Q Gang 'til I die
Pyramid on my eye
Button up on my chest
[?] chain on top, no tie
While I'm choppin' up this Thai food
Young Del God make god moves
Young Del God say "fuck fate"
If I lose then I choose to
This that chateau rap, that shit that niggas ain't used to
Might salad fork while I choose to
While I'm fine dining on YouTube
I'm a king, I said that I'm a king
Go to Onyx with an Onyx [?] on my ring

[Verse 22: YG]
I'm back in this bitch bashing
These rappers be swagger jacking
Clap 'em not, they don't even matter
1-2, this lung been splattered
And I heat a pistol on something
I keep a fifth on the belt
Pulling out the needles with the liable
Make shine sit on the shelf
Cause I ain't light on the body
Fuck waiting in your lobby
Hannah Montana finally did grew up
I've been waiting on Miley
I'm gangbanging 'til I break my fingers
Ti'l all my family members speak the slanguage
I ain't even drop no album yet
Off mixtapes, that's how I've been maintaining
If you offended, nigga, sorry
In backs there is bodies
Have your best friend, cuzzo, uncle, pops and another
Bury you in front of everybody
If I ain't been who you are I don't fuck with you
If I fuck with you then I'm stuck with you
I'm stuck with you, I'll shoot it out
Do some years and a couple months with you, woo

[Verse 23: CyHi da Prince]
Lyrically I am the epitome of a real MC
Biblically I am Timothy, visually I am Tripoli
Full of bigotry, fighting with Gaddafi over liberty
Politically I'm Barack smoking pot, sipping Hennessy
That's my only vice, old school noisy pipes
I ain't tryna be the richest, I'm cool with an M like Obie Trice
Rappers sing the same song, it must be karaoke night
That shit sound like you sang the hokey pokey twice
But this the main event, can't tell me that I ain't a prince
A one-hit wonder to your girl cause I came and went
But this that fly talk, smoke it, you'll get high off
The best thing to happen to the street since the sidewalk
Or the stop sign, or the shots flying
From a Glock 9, now the block crying, I don't freestyle, I jot mine
Call me Mr 1-800, all I got is hotlines
These niggas tell so many stories they can overlook the skyline
Biatch

[Verse 24: Young Thug]
Thugger!
Y'all got me drunk as hell
Now I been rich since I was little like Robin Hood
They been hatin' on me, cutting my cable cords
They gon' hate on her when she come in Michael Kors
Meanwhile, your diction is lack, grippin' this wood
I want you
She went to grabbin' for my jewels, I told her
Buy yourself a squad, you get a rollie, rollie
She know she can't have it, that shit love my woadie
She want to buy him a chinchilla
She see you serve foreign country boys from the village
Always, I gotta stand her
No, she don't want nobody to eat but her
She but like fuck them digits, stack them digits
Cut them then we benefit, cut them then we send them into
She ride three deep with molly in the middle
Put Micky Thompsons all on my Jeep
Ain't got no handprints on my golds, they all on my seat
Ten-thousand-dollar toe rings, featured by me
Bitches know it's time out
They be fucking me so good, I be like 'Time out!'
They want to fuck me 'til I tell 'em all to time out
She stroke it, I can't coach it, I'm like 'Time out!'
I'm not no snitch, but I be tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
Tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
I'm so tired of tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
Tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
Now I'ma show 'em
Her posse beat me by the threes, I call 'em Reggie Miller
She roll my weed in giant ?, she tall like 'Zilla
I want you
Baby, don't you run from me, you know I want you
She down with Slime, she got a tattoo in another color
Thugger getting high in London
Bitches walking 'round naked in no pajamas
Lil' homie ran off with lots of numbers
And for that, I'm gonna fuck your aunt, your sis, your mama
Then pop a pill together
She want to feel just like I feel, we growing wings together
Everything perfect about her, can't get my things together
I turn her up and we shit out earthlings together
Just do it like Michael Montana
My ? say I got stamina
I cooking the Hannah Montana
I bury these hoes like Santas do
I kill every one of my features
I spend all my money on divas
My pockets on yella bands
Just like a beeper

[Verse 25: A$ton Matthews]
They found Max B prints in my way
Bitch, I rode the Red Sea through my biblical days
No roof, snow boots, and that Persian [?]
Perving the 80's, you ain't never surf with the Brady's
Ric Flair, a heavyweight champion
Got Trish Stratus with them panties on singing "daddy's home"
Bust it, in these Space Jams, I'm a Monstar
Do-rag, tote on, that cake blocked in an arm war
So rumble, young man, rumble
Young killa when he came out the jungle
Young dealer in the rains with the bundles
Gets no realer, get chipped when you stumble
Eat the ox on the foil, ten toes in the soil
Chop chop 'till he drop, fuck what you thought
I never leave my life with a lawyer
Eyes wide with my head on the swivel
Choose a side or get left in the middle
I just treat with the sand on the beach
When the desert eagles meet, then I'm finna beat
Rest them in their sleep, you can lose 'em to the beef
Move or we shooting in the jeep
Homicide coming through the sneaks
Your hands ain't moving with your cheek
Bag 'em up and move 'em up the creek

[Verse 26: Prodigy]
On my test, got a story to 'em
Like all my raps weigh more than music
The more I write, the better I do it
And right now my stock is up
I do me from day one, huh
My nigga you know where it hit fours
Still fuck with me at day hundred
Cause I don't play, I gets off
Piss off, bitch, you ain't lit
You just a nigga saying shit
Rappers burn out, Pasadena, Kansas state
Mobb Deep is that truth, liar
Prodigy is that fuel fire
Come try me, I show better than tell, Infamous empire
I'm on point like the state building
I stay sharper than razor blades
Think you doing the most, I give you the most
Slashes to the face
Hoes like "he so angry", uh
Trust me bitch, you gon' thank me
Cause when it pop and the smoke gone
We gon' walk outta here safely
Fuck with me, I got you
Real nigga, no costume
This modern art that I spit
It's not no bullshit, and colossal
So pour it up, pour it up, that's how we ball out
Cause when I bomb on these niggas it's worse than nuclear fall out

[Verse 27: SL Jones]
Keep the small bills separate from the hundreds, please
That bank vault can't talk but the numbers read
And the tellers makin' statements, breakin' all the codes
This ain't a mothafuckin' date, we takin' all the hoes
Shop 'til I drop, freshest corpse in the morgue
Lookin' like a fashion fossil, I'm Gianni reborn
Four, I was voted most likely to trap
It's survival of the trillest, nigga, die or adapt
Waste a lot of champagne but I don't waste a drop of time
Public with my gang relations, throwin' up the proper signs
Sawed off the shotty, got the chopper circumcised
Chevy so clean, look like I dipped that bitch in turpentine
All my homies certified, hottest nigga outchea
Look like [?] we burned alive
Thought that I would ball 'til I fall, then I learned to fly
Spread my wings
They say success is contagious so I share my dreams

[Verse 28: Nasty Nigel]
Bolo swingin' from left to right
I'm not a cholo but I know hoes out in SoHo lovin' my ethnic type
When I smile for the photo looking like Lobo
Me and my bloodshot eyes
I pass on the Bud Light Lime
Just pass me that brew of St. Ides
Got cash, I ain't gotta think twice
Unconventional shit
Pretentious hipsters that diss
Half-assed review on Fader
Still get no love from Pitchfork
Nigel Rubirosa, que la cosa?
Feet up on the sofa
Heat up on the holster
World's Fair! Yeah, you know us
11-36-8 be the zip code
Corona, Queens nigga
That's what I call home
Feet on the dash, mind on the ass
Racin' the Sun just so I can get dome
Pimped the shorties I've been with
My friends that had me evicted
It's been two years and I'm slippin'
Still got no pot to piss in
It's everyone goes, they can suck a [?]
We have another song, I won't fuckin' feel it
Got my eyes on the Harley and I'm trying to peel it
Had my eyes on the bitch but she married Keaton
Got no job so I'm hardly eatin'
And you eatin' then we fuckin' beefin'
I need a pie and pizza just to meet up for a fuckin' feature

[Verse 29: Bobby Creekwater]
Man, they don't wanna see a nigga
Winning in a mothafucka
Happier than a mothafucka
You know lightweight grinnin' in a mothafucka
When you're a dead guy and you on that high
So the whole world spinnin' in a mothafucka
And a couple young angels hide their halo
Cause they're 'bout to start sinnin' in a mothafucka
They don't wanna see a nigga on the upswing
In a black tux with cufflinks
When you're the reason that every single girl in the party
Wanna dance and cuff drinks
When you're the reason that shit gets ran
And mothafuckas wheezin' to keep up with the plan
And the other niggas show up at your function
Actin' all anti-social [?]
Run up on your mama puttin' money in her hand
And you do that shit again and again and again
Pull up in the 8, goin' home with a 10
And you really can't defend or depend on your friends
Ex girlfriend wanna key up the Benz
When the Sun comes up, nigga we up to win
Mothafuck you man, all you do is set trends
And you do that shit again and again and again

[Verse 30: Action Bronson]
Ugh, ugh
Got those motherfucking custom Roshes
Feel me?
This big beard cover my face
Until my mother gets her first crib
My hand's on some surf shit
My Spanish mami perfect
Fuck around and get your father's shirt lift
Drop a thousand on some sake and some urchin
Swing the Dodge Viper lefty like I'm Randy Johnson
Hand me the Thompson
I'll spill your clams on the carpet
Then eat some snails with some garlic
Paint the town with a harlot
Cream FILAs and Carhartt
Three-wheelin out the car lot
Put the snorkel on the Wrangler cause I'm silly
I chip a little piece of brick into the philly
My daughter's neck is chilly
My son's neck is chilly
My mother wrist so cut
Look like it got bit by a grizzly
And these drugs got me spinning like some capoeira
Still rock the slow beats with gold teeth
Ain't afraid to hold heat
Control the Jeep
That's for the slow creep
Ya fuckin' pussy smells like old meat
It's me

[Verse 31: Heems]
Heema the highest human, flyest cumin in my unit
I ?, the shorties swoonin', and they want to get to spoonin'
Never wished i was taller, himanshu ain't no midget
Never wished i was a baller, if I want it, then I get it
I built a fucking blueprint, like who the fuck you kidding?
I;m ridin' around and I'm gettin' it, if it's mine, i'm spending
You lames and you fall, i'm like 2 Chainz when i ball
Got Husseins on my feet and Husains on my wall
Hussein Chalayans, a pretty girl said that's fancy
Unless his name is Hussein, give a fuck who your mans be
My shoes got dials, they ain't got laces
If you got beef, I show up with many faces
Been to many places where we leaving many casings
Running 'round, man, but we never catch no cases
Give a fuck about what you say, kicking it with like two babes
Top off, toupee, hot as fuck, creme brûlée

[Verse 32: Mike G]
There's no way I can care about much
You probably do the most and it's never enough
King Midas, I can make gold with a touch
Change my location to awesome, you should address me as such
Swear this game, you have to know it like the back of your hand
Destined to be like Superman for as long as you can
Wondering what's the purpose without living a life so grand
The worst hand is having the world without a master plan
I feel like you gotta pardon Mike for taking over this Earth
And [?] sleepless nights and long flights
And I don't like discussions unless it concerns a price
If you make it out of spite, you still make it so it's alright
I spit magic, so cold and lavish
Bad broads perform sexual acts in traffic
So smooth, the saxophone and jazz is
[?] what you lack and focus on what you have in the G
More than average, I'm nothing to test
If it's to me, you step and contest, then bring your best
Give it your all, now women beg me to call
And unless we overseas, we don't shop in the mall
Consider this move so private I've become urban myth
My aim is so swift, with this I can't miss
Top notch, number one on everybody's list
I promise to kill them all til everybody's missed

[Verse 33: Yak Ballz]
I never sell drugs, I took 'em
Never write rhymes, I cook 'em
I'm from the Old New York
Where you got your chain snatched
And your kicks tooken
I put my city up like I'm bench pressing
Scorin' high off the [?]
Brutal, last in 10 seconds
Jolly good, body good
I met a stripper named Hollywood
In Hollywood, glass slipper
And she gave me the sloppy gooooood
So you should tip her if you execute
Young leisure suit
[?] with no extra loot
My ex left me destitute
So chances are I don't remember you if I slept with you
You want karats, I'm turnin' rappers to vegetables
City of God, I'm askin' what would the devil do?
Instagram it, I forever rule, Ricky

[Verse 34: Zebra Katz]
Super villain, I'm killin', kick in the door
Watch me spillin' 'em, fuckin' winnin'
Straight killin' haters, they catchin' them feelings
See me grillin', me drillin', like we chillin'
But really see I'm fulfillin' their fantasies
Like I'm fuckin' my frienemy
Yo what's up, see me on [?] tryna get buck
Where in the world did he get that from?
When the bass drop down and he kick that drum
So what's up? Where in the world did he get that from?
Where in the world did he get that from?
When the bass drop down and he kick that drum
Yeah I've been known to really fuck it up
[?] zip zap zup
Speedin' on the highway, Bronco truck
When you ask for the Katz, mothafucka here I come
Yeah I've been known to really fuck it up
[?] zip zap zup
Speedin' on the highway, Bronco truck
When you ask for the Katz, mothafucka here I come

[Bridge: Zebra Katz] x2
Need [?]? Well I got it right here
Need motivation for the ass to gon' twerk? Well I got it right here
If you need a thing, a thing, then I got it right here
[?] I got it right here, I got it right here

[Verse 35: Curtis Williams]
Most of these niggas gon' hate
Me and my niggas get paid
One nigga swing then we all gon' swing
We all gon' catch that case
Couple blunts to the face, got a nigga straight
Rappin' on beats got a young nigga made
What can I say? My closet got Bape
I don't do delays, I want it today
Noisy pack in my wrap
Hennessy in my cup
Ginger ale if I chase
But I really don't do that much
I really don't have no time
You ain't tryin' to get no funds
Doin' this shit 'til I die
I'm rollin' and smokin' on drugs

[Verse 36: Reese]
Rollin' up, chokin' up on the kush smoke
Whip sick, big wheels, Big Willie shit
Hot boxer, hot sauna, car full, thick
I love the constituents, is down to get their lids peeled
Still pimpin', ridin' 'round town gettin' low
With my bright skin shawty, call her light show
She like Reese I'm tryna light that
Show love, she hold me down like an ice pack
It's big faces on faces bruh
Big faces on faces bruh
Dead men in my pockets got me goin' up
It's goin' face down if a nigga flex us
Yeah, in God we trust, but bands is a must
We gotta get that, spend that, get that
Re-up, recoup, repeat that

[Verse 37: Dave]
Say deuce 9 in that ending
Been winning since the beginning
Did a couple shows, need a couple more
That price right but we skippin'
[?] we gettin' it
With that work I turn into a chemist
Walter White, send a [?] to my niggas locked up in prison
Free my nigga Chris
And free my uncle Marky
Now tell them they fucked up
When they told 'em they could start me
Cause I ain't lettin' up, they're talkin' 'bout the best
They better mention us, yeah they better mention us

[Verse 38: LightSkinMac11]
Apartment off [?]
Rottweiler just to watch 'em
Maybachs for the profit
Get a Lexus for my mama
Hail Marys for our fathers
Press the pedal to get farther
In that new thing
[?] the dollar
All about it so don't fuckin' bother
My loose change got me Bruce Wayne
And a 3 page spread
Y'all was sleepin' on the flow just a couple months later
Now y'all purchasing the flow, East Coast

[Verse 39: Alkebulan]
King, god, pharoah
Feared the sensei, go for bone marrow, save
My name is running coyote
I'm on peyote with the queen, running on waves
I will make water out of Hennessy
[?] a monk, I was born a public enemy
Reign insurmountable
A woman will make me climax but she won't be into me
This is not a dream, marchin', in all black
A black claimed king
Respect the illustrator
Don't you dare try the Elohim of flexin'
I say my name when I name drop, son
Who's the god in this pantheon?
Two-9, Alkebulan, Alkebulan, Alkebulan, Alkebulan

[Verse 40: CEEJ]
Get up trick
Put your head to your knees like a sit-up, bitch
Get too live for the crew, Two-9

[Verse 41: Jace]
Runnin' our heart, sit up bitch
Hard to go to sleep, all we know is work

East Side nigga, still my turf
Pierce like 'Matic, hoes still at it
Swing like a batter and my crew goin' at it
Best believe that that shit gon' hurt

[Verse 42: Alexander Spit]
Toot up the French horn
The fog machine is sandstorm
Ain't go to camp
Cordless toward the performer that's keepin' your amps warm
'Fore the fans swarm
All but the limousine, swear to God that's in between
Indigo indie dream, you intervene
Yeah that's a Spit sixteen
Hearts inside of my tip jar
Like a bleeding beneath wood floor
And if every lion is purrin'
Then I'ma be certain I let my engine roar
I'm swingin' swords and swingin' chains
Singin' pure and bangin' strange
This Alexander Spit and I'm off the wall like [?]
I'm changin' lanes
Driftin' around whatever it is this game became
Like gorillas and orangutans
Go bananas and bangarang
They say I'm prayin' to that cross
For all of that fifteen minute fame
But I'ma get my [?]
And the god's here
So baby just open your bra zip
And just let them titties out
And let 'em bounce like this was Paul Revere
I'm 7.0in' on Pitchfork
I'm 10-0in' on this court
This Alexander Spit  with a pistol
[?] full of [?], I got this

[Verse 43: ScottyATL]
Better have my check, I need that first
Before I move, before I step
See I been burned it don't take long
And learn quick, it ain't no twice
I gave my time, I gave my life
So I won't bet what all I spent
I'm trying to be good, I'll take your bitch
And I ain't even playin, just ask my clique
You know my steez, trying to get real A-Town
Got that or either got sump'n to give away
Big feet on the bottom of a Chevrolet
Everybody and they mamma sell plenty hay
Need to ride with the weight scale
Propped up in the seat trying to get that
My ? on a eastside ho ?????
Tell Bron Bron we can bring the Heat back
I'm a champ, I support it
Flipping through the hundred
Cool Club with it
Running to the money
I'm in shape, I'm in shape stacking cake
Duncan Hines go get "Faith" thats my last tape
I'm on 10, I'm on fire, I'm on point, I'm on smash
Rolly on my dash, breaking down in my Cad'
I'm Atlanta, ScottyATL ho 1 space that's a Y not an IE
Slipped in ain't even check ID
Game leave me I'ma rap IV

[Verse 44: Da$h]
Year before '83, I be the kid who found ET
Tell him teach me all he know, prolly make him smoke some dope
Call a bitch over for throat and put her on some [?]
Just to get up in her brain and now she out makin' me change
I'm full of dynamite, throw her on the blade, no Wesley Snipes
Young Roxanne, baby, sell that body to the night
I'm trife as fuck, light the blunt, get high enough to die for once
[?] throw the pad at Christ, they askin' God how do I write this stuff
The Lord never liked me much, but I'm sayin', "Oh well"
Blazin' up with the devil, watchin' old Hell in the Cell
Matches your favorite actress, blastin' naked on my mattress
Polygraphs break, you say I ain't the illest nigga rappin'
The fucking  captain of this multi million dollar faction
Man didn't chief
My sons of sons'll sandwich the beef
We get loot, always scram from police
You bitch niggas lose your head if you speak
I ash the doobie off the cruise ship
And flew hash, cheffin' out of Ruth Chris
Two bitches tellin' me they do sniff
What do you know?
So much wax in this bitch, smokin'
You'd thinkin' I'm fuckin' Madame Tussauds
[?]
Nah, fuck that
Bring them [?] back
[?]
On a daily basis, sip liquor, I never chase it
[?] I'm the greatest, carve a statue of my face, bitch
