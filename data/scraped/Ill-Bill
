[Verse 1: Planetary]
Yeah! Yo, uh
A lot of rappers try approaching the omen
My poems will punish your people while I’m up at the podium
Pharaohs folding 'em, like washed clothes again
I'm a vulture when the flow go choke your kin
Broke, I leave most of them, slow, I keep my motionin'
Eye on the prize
I silence the wise, my lyrics make a scientist cry
Making a secret society expose their purpose
Making 'em unleash info and explode in my surface
I'm taking my time to birth this, rap entity earthless
It's show time, there's no time, be ready when the curtain split
I'm hurtin' shit, too powerful for painkillers
On the concrete jungle we walk like trained guerillas
Untamed, and my niggas is Kane, Kool G, Rakim, combined into one frame
We like the new mecca of immaculate rappers
Vinnie Paz, call the goons, now we back with the clappers

[Verse 2: Chief Kamachi]
Yo, remain silent, kill him with what I mentally says
Bloody Fez, choke you like an Indian rez
Kamach, animal Turk, sick with a cannibal smirk
Welcome, this where the murderers lurk
It's my mind, that make sure that the Sun can work
Scorch bodies, leave all of your gunmen hurt
Pharaoh sultans, create a serious cult jam
And my hand is where the tears of the pope ran
They stay watching like they keep me on a scope cam
I'm in Heaven with the angels that smoke grams
You need God, that's why the earth so damned
International, trying to get my flow banned
That's cool, if I don't kick these prayers
A lot of floods and fam' is gonna hit these years
Kamachi back on the chapel stairs
Open the clouds, let the thunder clap your ears

[Verse 3: King Syze]
You wanna put your money up? Then muthafucker then put it
For your family's sanity man, I wish that you wouldn't
Niggas got nice flows, just dont know where to put it
And I know your whole life your raps are edited footage
And y'all mixtape niggas couldn't see my plateaus
All up in my presence, while y'all actin' bashful
King Syze casting an ecliptic rap flow
Y'all little light niggas couldn't feed my shadows
From, city to city, intersection to section
But you reflexin', with or without a weapon
I'm always steppin', never scared
But always and forever prepared
Yeah the ones who drink gas man is revvin' their gears

[Verse 4: Reef the Lost Cauze]
You now rocking' with the foulest clique in the continent
Total dominance, rise to prominence
In my prime like Optimus, stand in astonishment
At this conglomerate, an axis of evil
I know where Osama is, he down in Camp David
Down and dirty like a damp basement
The champ must demand greatness
From himself, or be another contender
There's hundreds of niggas
Dead left under the river
From the days of slaves
To hurricanes in Orleans
See my people's graves floatin' amongst the waves
There's hell to pay, but
The devil don't take checks
I tried to send a message to God
His phone don't take texts
I need a new plan, a crook with knowledge
Times is hard homie, why I took them dollars
Man, my momma got a mortgage
And my little baby sister need books for college
I rob all of y'all

[Verse 5: Doap Nixon]
Hey, yo, they want the hood in here so they called me first
I give 'em rappers gatorade cause they ball with thirst, UH!
This is more than music
But these niggas is mad trash
That's why the stores refuse 'em
Yo, I'm out in Georgia, went straight to the block
I'm seein' cats motorcyclin' dawg, I'm doin the walk
I'm an O.G., call my Italian niggas a wop
Though their papers ain't right, but they got weight on the block
I love 'em uh
Hand to hand, see your hands ache
I drunk so much syrup dawg I stopped eatin' pancakes
Ya niggas cool dawg mine's absurd hot
Stop frontin' like you's a killer money, your nerves shot
Yo you's a Paxil nigga, dumpin' Zoloft in coffee
AOTP what exhaust be
Can't keep it gear, cause I'm blinging with F's
But I got my mind right so swing your shit to the left

[Verse 6: Demoz]
Nigga if I had 24 hours to live
Fuck 24 hours, gimme 24 seconds
Vin I'm drivin' off a bridge
Broken rib, no windshield, covered in kerosene
Gasoline tank filled to the top
Magazines of these phony rappers ripped in pieces
No priest is, strong enough to take me out of my zone
I broke Jesus, choke niggas who squeal
Rob niggas who steal, kill niggas who kill
I'm too sick for a pill
Man these niggas ain't real, they real fake
They say they a man but they fuckin' reveal snakes
That's when you put 'em in a truck with their grill taped
Rip in reverse then run into a steel gate
I'm a suicide driver, never been a liar
If I don't kill you later, I'mma kill you Mañana
You don't want no problems
You don't want no drama
Nigga I'mma take a trip with your baby momma, suicide driver

[Verse 7: Celph Titled]
Ya better cross your T's
Cause we'll dot your eyes
You can say that you specialize but pharaohs will optimize
Backstage will get a bitch back smacked there
The mac glare like dirty south pimp slap clap snares, YEAH!
Holy paragraphs, what kind of shit is that?
I'm Jesus in the flesh so this is motherfuckin' Christian rap
Y'all just Christmas wrap, must be the secret Santa
My reindeer aim near, pierce you with the antlers
I made 'em go easy, and called off the wolves on my AOTP radio CB
Cause y'all ain't worthy of grenades and RPGs
Slit throat, hope you float with sardines and seaweed
Cause this is C-E-L-P-H demonic symphony
Listen to the hell we make
And a year before your kids tenth birthday came
You didn't have to wait for candles on the cake to see the nine flame

[Verse 8: Vinnie Paz]
Respect a G, my clique clap at you incessantly
I lay back and drink alcohol excessively
It ain't a rapper that's alive today that's testing me
I got degrees in being ignorant and weaponry
A 40 oz and Dutch Master is the recipe
That's my shit there, that'll be the death of me
Give me a death mask, better yet an effigy
I understand the math of death and it's complexity
I understand how you was violently murked
I understand how you was raised under the lies of the church
But understand and recognize that I'm cursed
With the ability to end your fucking lives with a verse[Vinnie Paz]
I murder you and laugh
I'm Barry Sanders slashin' through the path
You a magician's assistant
I'm sawin' you in half
You a heathen that rely on the beast
I'm a demon at the fire crucifyin' the priest
I shine over beats
A motherfuckin' beast on the mic
I'm a lion out the jungle, raw meat what I like
I bleed in a fight, Vinnie like the taste of his blood
And I'll open up your stomach like the case of a slug
I'm faithful to drugs, puttin' metal plates in your mug
Dump your body in the motherfuckin' lake in a rug
Face in the mud, y'all create the facade
That my people have exterminated faith in they god
Patience is hard, cousin, but it pays to be calm
Go to war for anybody who embraces Islam
I'm gracious and warm, ready for the place in the war
And I'm ready to smash your motherfuckin' face in the floor

[Hook]
We got that gangster gangster shit
"The heavy metal king hold big shit"
We got that murder murder shit
You talk that gangster gangster shit
We live that murder murder shit

[Ill Bill]
Without order nothing exists, without chaos nothing evolves
Now get on your knees so I can stick this gun in your mouth
I'm a slayer album personified, Holocaust, Columbine
Middle Passage, Israel versus Palestine
It's the cult leader drink your Kool-Aid
Roll with the doctors that produce AIDS
I open my mouth, I shoot flames
The freedom fighter that got the whole world terrified
Ill Bill, human manifestation of genocide
Stand amongst Grammy winning grimy nose candy sniffers
Blast the black metal at you like Danny Lilker
It's impossible to escape my matrix of hate
I'll make a good girl a cum dumpster, Satan awaits
Set the razors to AKs and turn rasins to grapes
Turn blood into wine with an insatiable taste
Drink from the goblet of gore, vomiting porn
Sodom and Gomorrah back to Canarsie New York

[Sample]
Is this the bringing of the king to his parliament
Till the land was all undone and darkened by such deeds

[Hook]

[Vinnie Paz/Louie Dogs]
You don't know about the gospel of Judas
About the information found in the Galapagos Ruins
How the warriors would sharpen they blades
How if they wanted to the government could cure you of AIDS
We the equivalent of fire and ice
The equivalent of a prisoner who die for his rights
I'm lyin' to Christ, put your fuckin' spine in a vice
I'm like Trump in the Apprentice, only fire at night
I'm dyin' to fight, slap you five and put ten in you
Louie Dogs, the fuckin' Genocide General
So I say fuck the CIA and they plan
Get me outta here I'd rather fuckin' stay in Iran
I'll run up on you with grenades in my hand
If you fuckin' round with Bill or try to hate on my fam
It's the dichotomy of hatred in man
If you ever even think of tryin' to play me then blam
Blap bap

[Hook][Intro - Bizarre]
Reel Wolf, underground shit
I guess I'm up first, right?
I'mma rap first?
Alright, let me hit this blunt right quick

[Verse 1 - Bizarre]
I'm the sickest motherfucker on this earth
That'll fuck a transvestite, dog, or blue Smurf
Bizarre smack a bitch quick
Then give her ass and lick while she take a shit
Fuck your period, fuck your rag
Take it in your ass, just like a fag
All my fans is crazy, they love it
That's why I say fuck it, and smack you in public
I'm rugged!

[Verse 2 - Reef the Lost Cauze]
Yeah, you know me well
The Gods said that they owe me hell
I'm The Outlaw Josey Wales
I make a nigga feel spiritual like holy tales
From the bible, roll Exodus and then inhale
No one knows you, so if I kill you who’d I tell?
Half-hipster, whiney nigga that’s a fuckin' fail
Life without purpose, that’s a fucking jail
Lost Cauze, when I spit it’s fucking hell

[Verse 3 - Ill Bill]
Master a dance of lesbians
Satanic majesty's equestrian
On a black steed stampeding pedestrians
'Do what thou willt' shall be the whole of the law
I get my dick sucked by a nun with the soul of a whore
Superstitious like a gypsy casting a death-spell
Exhale chem-trails
Strangle you with your own entrails
14th day of July innocence was averted
Ill Bill, born on the same day Billy The Kid was murdered

[Verse 4 - Slaine]
It's kill or be killed
So watch out for the villain - he's ill
I'm slinging rap, swinging bats like I'm in little league still
Sniffing cocaine off a coin with Kennedy's grill
Cough from a joint while I'm crushing my enemies will
I'm a homicidal Hercules, doggie, I'm an urban myth
I swerve the whip, get my dick sucked while on my work release
I give these rappers bad advice and a nervous twitch
Penetrate and innovate, a renegade, I murder shit

[Hook]
I'm a real wolf
With the Underworld flick

[Verse 5 - Celph Titled]
I ain't racist just cause I split your head to the white meat
The missing link Yeti-Sasquatch, yeah I might be
This shit's real - distribute guns in the kids meal
Open the box, hold the Glock, bust a shot through the windshield
The manifestation of evil stay alive and breathing
I'm Satan's fitness trainer, exercising demons
Respect the shooter, I'll find the bastard
Hell, my loaded pistol is a fire hazard

[Verse 6 - King Gordy]
My dick stays hard in graveyards, you pray hard
As I make love to Adolf Hitler’s carcass
Call me a nigger as I lick his heartless chest
I guess these skinhead Nazis wanna get retarded
Why? Cuz I’m fucking your leader all in his ass
Speak to him in Hebrew, fuck the Führer until he's back, dead again
Tell the Aryans I’m burying my head right in his belly
And it’s scary cause I'm licking his mustache

[Verse 7 - Sid]
Son of a killer, Mr. fucking grimey
SAS 22nd regiment limey
Born in a bar with my eyes wide open
Inspired by debacles since I came out the fallopian
We don't fuck around, got permits to carry
Everybody walks around like Dirty fucking Harry
Don't play my town, cause we will fucking bury you
Carry you to a farm cut off your arms, chewed up by animals

[Verse 8 - PMD]
On your mark, get set, ready to go
Green light, checkered flag, time to get that dough
And ayo, in the underworld I'm half-wolf and half-lycan
Swing the Excalibur, barbaric viking

[Verse 9 - Sean Strange]
Vicodin, marijuana, cocaine, the Grateful Dead
Average rapper kidnapping
Be sure to make your bed
When they battle me fatality take your head
And write a rhyme with your blood
The page's painted red

[Hook]

[Verse 10 - Apathy]
I'm the king of Castle Greyskull
My grey matter's powerful as Grey Hulk
I’m Zartan, I’m Tarzan before he went to Greystroke
My brain's broke, slang dope
And when I speak, my slang's dope
You're soft as fuck - your whole album is a gay joke
Rap's lethal, spit a sixteen at you
We'll paint the ceiling with your brains
Like the Sistine Chapel
I'm the cardinal of carnage, the poisonous priest
Don't bother praying to your God
There's no avoiding this beast

[Verse 11 - Swifty McVay]
You ain't about that life
You a bastard that won't attack
I'm the type to grab a knife
And I'm stabbing you with it backwards
I'm backslapping wack ass non-rappers
Snatch the breath out of you faster than asthma without a gas mask
I lace hash, a heinous figure
Slash-murderer, I'm burning these legacy killers
Putting mo' metal in niggas than robotic mechanisms
Kill his woman and brag about it in prison

[Verse 12 - Vinnie Paz]
Rambo-knife, show you what bloody is
You call it a dead cop, I call it a bloody pig
You think your hands nice money? You's a funny kid
You next to get molly-whopped like your buddy did
The Ruger Blackhawk, stick it in the dunny rib
Throw him in the fucking bathroom like Sunny did
The biggest show in your career; like a hundred kids
The AR-15 blew off like a hundred wigs

[Verse 13 - Tech N9ne]
Grim reaper to Ariel Castro, Adam Lanza, James Holmes
Flame on, no it ain't wrong when I'mma have them plans for cancer
Then land ya in a hands up tense panthers
Damned with antlers to ram ya man pampers
Scrams the answer, No evil understands ya
Grandeur and like you were three times the word lambda
I’ll be the damper on a clan’s fam camper
Necromancer drinking vodka and Fanta with Santa

[Hook][Raekwon]
Wire cell frames on me, good Nike, yeah
True, alotta chains on, this is how we do the thing, enlight me
Clubbed out, bugged out, this is what them thugs bout
Bust off shotties, knock niggas mother's out
Rolling in them renters in winter, too much bones get bent up
The saw'll eat up, your chrome for dinner
We tasting VS's, very special Cognac since G.S.'s
Now we leaning Louis sneakers and C.L.S.'s
I'm far from your average rapper, yeah Shallah, hit with an actor
Cutting through your time, then slap ya
Yo, you see me on them Smack shits, all of my Skittles on
In black whips, living comfortable in some glass cribs
Word to Jabari, my junior, only two years old
Swimming with the sharks, I'mma feed you tuna
Your pops been a whale since jail
Was taking niggas out to Brazil

[Ill Bill]
Where carnivale mamis is ill
Take me to Paul Wall, buy me a grill
I got groupies, buying me Gucci's and exclusive Nike's, it's real
I stay biz in the kitchen with the Chef Rae-Kwiz
It's easy five mill or I'mma have to take they kids
I figured out how to rape the system, I made more than your album budget
Off of a freestyle, on this mixtape, a hustler
That understand dollars and cents
I get blowjobs from runway models in France
The rap Burt Reynolds, when I married the world troubles
Producing earthquakes, turning ya stone hedge to pebbles
The life we chose, the path we lead, ain't none of us'll
See heaven, that's our own guarantee
Never, rat on your friends, always keep your mouth shut
The back of the Benz, put this in your mouth, slut
I saw, I conquered, I came and I'm out
Laid it out, all on the tonsils, then skeet in her mouth[Verse 1: Planetary]

A lot of rappers
Try approaching the omen
My palms are punishing people
While I'm up at the podium
Pharaohs folding them
Like washed clothes again
I'm a vulture when
The flow go choke your kid
Broke
I leave most of them
Slow
I keep my motion in
Eye on the prize
I silence the wise
With lyrics making scientists cry
Making a secret society
Expose they purpose
Making them unleash info
And exploding my surface
I'm taking my time to birth this
Rap entity earthless
It's show time
There's no time
We ready when the curtain split
I'm hurting shit
Too powerful for painkillers
On the concrete jungle
We walk like trained guerrillas
Untamed
And my niggas is Kane
Kool G
Rakim
Combine into one frame
We like the new mecca
Of immaculate rappers
Vinnie Paz
Call the ghouls
Now we back with the clappers

[Verse 2: Chief Kamachi]

Yo

Kill him with what I mentally says
Bloody Fez
Choke you like an Indian res
Kamach
Animal Turk
Sick with a cannibal smirk
Welcome
This where the murderers lurk
It's my mind
To make sure that the Sun can work
Scorch bodies
Leave all of your gunmen hurt
Pharaoh sultans
Create a serious cult jam
And my hand is where
The tears of the pope ran
They stay watching like
They keep me on a scope cam
I'm in heaven with the angels
And smoke grams
You need God
That's why the earth so damned
International
Trying to get my flow banned
That's cool
If I don't kick these prayers
A lot of floods and famine's
Gonna hit these years
Kamachi back on the chapel stairs
Open the clouds
Let the thunder clap your ears

[Verse 3: King Syze]

If you wanna put your money up
Then mother fucker then put it
For your families sanity man
I wish that you wouldn't
Niggas got nice flows
Just don't know where to put it
And I know your whole life
Your raps are edited footage
Hey y'all mix tape niggas

Foulest clique in the continent
Total dominance
Rise to prominence

Stand in astonishment

An axis of evil

He down in Camp David
Down and dirty like a damp basement
The champ must demand greatness
From himself
Or be another contender
There's 100's of niggas
Dead left under the river
From the days of slaves
To Hurricanes in Orleans
See my peoples graves floating amongst
The waves
There's hell to pay but
The devil don't take checks
I try to send a message to God
His phone don't take text
I need a new plan
A crook with knowledge
Times is hard homie
Why I took them dollars
Man
My momma got a mortgage
And my little baby sister
Needs books for college

Nigga

Broken rib

Covered in kerosene
Gasoline
Tank filled to the top
Magazines of these phony rappers
Ripped in pieces

Strong enough to take me out of my zone
I broke jesus
Choke niggas who squeal
Rob niggas who steal
Kill niggas who kill
I'm too sick for a pill
Man these niggas

The mac player like dirty south
Pimp slapped clap snares
Holy Paragraphs
What kind of shit is that
I'm Jesus in the flesh
So this is mother fucking Christian rap
Y'all just Christmas wrap
Must be the secret Santa
My reindeer aim near
Pierce you with the antlers

And called off the wolves
On my AOTP radio CB
Cuz y'all ain't worthy of grenades and RPG's
Slit throat
Hope you float with sardines and seaweed
Cuz this is C-E
L-P-H
Demonic symphony
Listen to the hell we make
And a year before your kids 10th birthday came
You didn't have to wait for candles on the cake
To see the nine flame

[Verse 8: Vinnie Paz]

Respect a G
My clique clap at you incessantly
I lay back and drink alcohol excessively
There ain't a rapper
That's alive today that's testing me
I got degrees in being
Ignorant and weaponry
A 40 oz
A dutch master is the recipe
That's my shit there
That'll be the death of me
Give me a death mask
Better yet a effigy
I understand the math of death
And it's complexity
I understand how you was
Violently murdered
I understand how you was raised
Under the lies of the church
But understand and recognize
That I'm cursed
With the ability
To end your fucking lives with a verse

Yeah
Paz-man
AOTP
Ill Bill on the beat
Billy Crystal
What up baby
La Coka
AOTP[Ill Bill]

First and foremost, a toast to my Mom & my Pop
My daughter and my wife, there’s no one more important in my life
Without them I wouldn’t be alive in the literal sense
And in the mind, they are my inspiration to grind
My reason to live, rest in peace to my grandmothers and my uncles
Y'all molded the person I became and for that I love you
It’s difficult to explain through lyrics how much I miss you
Please accept any success I’ve achieved as a tribute
A testament to your impact
And influence on everything I’ve ever did, you’ll forever live
I never been a religious person but still bear witness to a higher power
Some only pray in their final hour
But I remain grateful for my blessings
Thankful to the most high, for the many gifts whether present
Past or futuristic, blessed to be able to express myself through words
And give thanks using the lyrics

(Interlude)
The winner is…
Ill Bill… number one
I feel very grateful, very humble
I wanna thank everyone
I’ve waited a very long time
I dedicate this to you for believing in me
I just wanna say… thanks… thank you

[Ill Bill]

Secondly I’d like to address where it all popped
From Farragut Road to your block
Gargling booze, and saw god sparking a doob
Marketing crude, sharpening tools, we're martyrs & goon shooters
That shoot constant modern day Goose Gossage
Ice cold though, Siberian summers appear hotter
Quite bold like a Nigerian underwear bomber
Dope war, folklore, coke whore smoke more
Morbid epitaph, Sordid tortured past provoke more
Try to stab me with a knife to be exact
Spitefully attacked, trifling and wack, grimier in fact
Than any award or any rap, any whore or any rat
Close the door on petty crap
Very happy, thankful to my best of friends
Had to cut ties with any of the very many snakes in the grass that left me for dead
Dumped in the river, swept in the ocean
Heavy emotion, stand firm though the end is approaching, I’m open

(Interlude)
The winner is…
Ill Bill… number one
Ladies and gentleman, a real round of applause
Yall appointed me to bring rap justice
I’ve waited a very long time
I dedicate this to you for believing in me
It’s truly fantastic
To show our appreciation for you

[Ill Bill]

Lastly I’d like to thank all my influences
And various inspirational individuals that got me in the music business
I'm a fan first so I appreciate mines
Thanks to my fans, you're my family, I take pride
In your support and every album you bought
Down for life, I love y'all for never doubting your boy
Same way I love LL Cool J and Kiss
One made me wanna rock, the other made me wanna spit
Rick Rubin made me wanna flip em both at the same time
Slayer and Scarface inspired me to write insane rhymes
Thanks to L'Amours in Brooklyn accepting my fake ID
Opened for Sepultura there when I was only 17
Thanks to my band Injustice
Thanks to Ace London Studios for letting us rehearse when we ain’t have nothing
And shouts to all of yall that said I couldn’t do it
You gave me the fire to kick down the door and walk through it

(Interlude)
The winner is…
Ill Bill… number one
I feel very grateful, very humble
And I owe thanks to many, many people
I’ve waited a very long time
I dedicate this to you for believing in me
What more could I say? I wouldn’t be here today if the old school didn’t pave the way
Ill Bill, rap crusader
Rap crusader
Ill Bill, rap crusader
Rap crusader
Ill Bill, rap crusader
Ill Bill, rap crusader[Verse 1: Ill Bill]
They killed my entire family
Murdered and tortured, raped and pillaged
I was only five and I was the only surviving witness
My entire village burnt to the ground
He wore a serpent in his crown
Happily committed murder with a frown
In an army of black-hooded fiery-skulled generals
And a sorcerer that could cast spells that’ll change your genitals
Held me in slavery till I turned eighteen
Killed my slave master, five years later became king
And I slain dragons and ate steaks during famine
Had the seeds of war planted in a dirty tavern
Had the seeds of presidents killed in a burst of anger
And had their parents bleed to death on the floor of a dirty bathroom
I watched their palaces burn, I seen the ashes of my comrades
Returned to their family in an urn
While a proud child remembers his father that died
The cycle continues with vengeance alive in his mind

[Hook: Max Cavalera]
Refuse, resist, war is my destiny!
Desire unleashed, war is my destiny!
Chaos, A.D., war is my destiny!
Under a pale grey sky, war is my destiny!

[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]
Yeah, yeah, I was an angel before a third of the stars fell
Cast with the sternum from Satan into the pit of hell
Our beloved leader forced to be a bottom-feeder
The great deceiver that promised victory over the monkey lovers
We took a vote to restructure and traitors fell upon him
We ripped his skin off and crowned a new son in the morning
A new president to lead our corporation
The vengeance on God and Heaven’s domination
But I seduced the daughters of man and made the Nephilim
I demanded human sacrifice from the rest of them
I became the spirit that tortured and protected them
And I built them the tower of language that connected them
And then the Lord cried, water falling out from his eyes
And my children died drowning in the tears from the sky
And it was then that Satan crawled back to me with a plan
A design for the ultimate corruption of man
See back then we used to set the chosen ones on fire
You really think God only sent a single messiah?
And so we allowed the birth of many prophets on earth
And since the followers were human they were born with a curse
They began to claim superiority to their brothers
And for eighty-five thousand years conquered each other
And when they prayed before battle they were praying to me
Killing in God’s name cause war is my destiny!

[Hook][Ill BilL]
Fuck the machine, I’m raging against the broke life
I love the cream, my sayings affect the coke price
My demons are devils to the things that I don’t like
Can I detach myself from 'em I know it’s so trife
Murder assault, wild out of control type
Worshiping at the altar of Ralph like a low life
Dress correct, heavy metal emperor roll tight
I’m obsessed with death, helter skelter like Sean Price
Know the tech kid the sound of thunder
No respectable Boba Fett like bounty hunter
No remorse, mega force records seek and destroy
We kill em all, zip up the bag, bring em to the morgue
Bring him to the coroner table then cut him up and look inside of him
What the fuck would they think if someone lied to them?
Sold em the dead dreams, listening to philosophers
Going against me? Victory is impossible

[Hook x2]
Blood, money and death, dark side justice
Trust nothing except, dark side justice
Fuck love and respect, dark side justice
120% dark side justice

[Jus Allah]
My rap’s scary, it escaped from my Blackberry
Your rap stays trapped, it’s fake and imaginary
My rap full of gats and bad vocabulary
My rap has drug tracks and blood capillaries
It’s all cemetery, and about mortuaries
I ain’t saying anything out of the ordinary
Not unusual, it’s the cult itinerary
Attending funerals with a dull contemporary
Weapons put you in blessings whenever necessary
Gun straightened paper better than a secretary
With just one shot turn a jock into a Jerry
The Glock said we carry, turn The Rock into a fairy
Murder for no reason other than monetary
The devil made me do it, it’s involuntary
I keep clips and newspaper obituaries
Behind a bookcase with a trick dictionary

[Hook x2]
Blood, money and death, dark side justice
Trust nothing except, dark side justice
Fuck love and respect, dark side justice
120% dark side justice

[Vinnie Paz]
It’s a perfect murder scene, a perfect murder about a perfect person
Brujeria verse perfectly cursing a virgin
What’s the faculty of energy perfect exertion
Call me majesty, my words are conversed in a serpent
Pussy boy left the war, they call it desertion
I am dirty, I am opposite in every detergent
If it isn't a Grey Goose then it’s certainly Bourbon
I write my rhyme in Beirut with a burgundy turban
Hard body rap, punch you in the chatter box
I would never walk the hallways unless I had a ox
That’s the reason why they put me in padded box
I would’ve never been a problem if I had my pops
I pull a motherfuckers card like a magic shop
Mossberg means spin several metal savage shots
The heater hit the fuckin flesh like the cattle prod
My physical body’s the vehicle for wrath of God

[Hook x2]
Blood, money and death, dark side justice
Trust nothing except, dark side justice
Fuck love and respect, dark side justice
120% dark side justice[Verse One: Ill Bill]
Holy shit, they tried to torture me, three officers bleed nauseously
They eating pork and beans and involved in Pagan sorcery
Super vegan, heard your crew is beefing, now goons is creeping
Hebrews blacker than Zulus and guidos rocking wifebeaters
DT’s rocking Fubu up in the ninth precinct
Rusty pipes, no-bar types scheming through life cheating
Seen the pig get shot in the face for the right reasons
Find a way to civilize a trife heathen
The Ill Bill collector suicide king, my sounds are hard drugs
We God’s thug popping off guns, you lost blood
Like you lost your head
Talking to me is like having your fortune read
By a fourth-century sorcerer that tortures men
Then try to walk the subway platform with gats drawn
Like a postal worker coming home drunk and just lost his job
That’s what we dealing with in Roman times
I never liked schools, fucking devils always told me lies
And try to brainwash
But re-evaluate everybody fucking hates cops
And if you blasted one you gained props
Hyper shit, Roddy Piper shit, tiger type to sniper shit
Be selling my fly shit for five percent, fuck that
I be on top going for delf
Twelve thousand units then I sold another twelve
I Shot Reagan was the joint that sparked the tight chaos
Like stray shots that spray cops, break up the séance

[Verse Two: Jise One]
Eh yo white thugs is shot watch war minister’s spot
Niggas are clocked up cause the undergound explodes hot
Melting pot, the vandal four angle to stop your free fall
Before you get the sawed-off, welcome to get your timbs sawed
Lyric evangelist, I’ll never turn the cheek
I tore it off your face, it ain’t sweet, sour to hot piece
Speak to hear your half-ass multiplied by two
Goon niggas is anal, through the butt they learn to chew food
Spit it out, you talk shit Q, your rhymes are old too
So you see me split ways
Seven to give to high shroom
Zoom as your lady flashing sideways
Battle you for the saddle (i see you), lost the rhythm to foreplay
Nasty king interpret, delegate passion swimmer
Sinner to all religious sect, tremor to any bigger
Trigger to mental pistol power, shower your appearance
Clearance shatter the nearest foul play, who wanna feel this?

[Verse Three: Goretex]
This is camp site, take my advice, a game of life
Holy nights like Hanukkah lights amid your gun fights
Tel Aviv with laser sights, pluton shit
Eh yo we move shit
Left-wing cats straight out of goon flicks
So Uncle Howie gave them pigs a chase
We here to fit the states
Glenwood projects made trays into base
Y’all can’t emerge in a safe place
I turn energy into sensory data in high rates
W-H-T, your TV’s and CD’s
LSD flash, kill my landlord for seven G’s
Tangle with my clique, I’ll leave you shackled from your dick
Mexican magic (?) (peyote?) (owe me?) an extra clip
Yo I was bred with a tortured head
Connected with the dead, don’t bother with needles, we conquered then fled
Cashless society awaits us, don’t ever trace us
You caught me, sort of like Kiss without the makeup

[Verse Four: Q-Unique]
Incineration of your whole Generation X
Next context sounded similar to top ten
Must stop when I drop panic and see what I’m thinking
Iceberg your brain state got your mind sinking
Open like the fat beats I’m singing
Consider it illiterate, you can’t read between the lines
I’m ten times the pen rhymes you write on blue lines
Exaggerated existence of commercial sounds
Like pussy politicians got political prisoners locked down
Knock down and hit you with the impact
Of a penny tossed off the observation deck of a skyscraper
I spy my paper like a board or secret cult
The vital data that can shatter government bodies, rock parties
Like a boulder rolling through a nightclub
One might bug at the fact that fourteen years
Of rap only got me underground dap
I’m past that like I missed my stop on the A-Train
Here’s the weight gain from the great brain
Pass the spray paint(Chorus)

I turned 21 in prison, doing life without parole
When the jury heard what I'd done, guilty was the vote
When the judge gave me my sentence, he read it to me cold
Whiskey on his breath, masturbating underneath his robe
Only 21 in prison, doing life without parole
When I had the chance, I should've sold the devil my soul
Hell yeah, I shot the sheriff, left his body full of holes
Now I'm 21 in prison, doing life without parole

(Verse 1)

We all enter the world the same way
Naked and screaming, soaked in blood but things change
Some are brought home to palaces, others to the projects
Some are born billionaires and some are born convicts
Momma said when life gives you lemons make lemonade
Take a piss in it and serve it to the people that you hate
My pops always said there's only two types my friend
Those with loaded guns and those who eat shit 'til they're dead
I miss both of them, one's gone, the other in prison
I hate both of them, the love dies and none of it given
I gave both of them enough time to show me their wisdom
I'll take both of them to hell with me, my soul is convicted
As I stand in front of Satan hoping for answers
Coping with madness, I hold the chrome like a social advantage
Never hate your enemies, it affects your judgement
Keep it close point blank range and render justice!

(Chorus)

(Verse 2)

Ladies and gentlemen of the jury
The defendant's story begins within a childhood of fear and misery
Age ten, witnessed his father murder his own mother
The guilt of her death lingers in his dreams when he slumbers
Even though he was a child he still felt responsible
Most of his adolescence in and out of mental hospitals
Anti-social, anti-everything
Sucked into a system, pacified by prescribed medicine
With psychiatrists as father figures
His biological a scumbag sociopath locked in prison
He hated him with all his heart and so he never visited
Though the monster that his father was also lived in him
Kill a person you're a murderer, thousands you're a terrorists
Everyone, you're the father of Jesus of Nazareth
Perception is reality, facts are negotiable
I'll clap the Mac off and put twenty-one holes in you

(Chorus)

Coke, it costs money
Planes, they cost money
This yacht, it all costs money
Do you think Kitty's free? (What?!) huh!?
Kitty turn around (What?) turn around
Mister please put the gun down
(gunshot)
Now the next time that a plane goes down
You better be on it[Hook 2x]
A bullet never lies, it always tells the truth
My words are gunshots that influence the youth
Assassinate presidents like John Wilkes Booth
Put the message in the barrel of your gun then *bang*

[Verse 1: Ill Bill]
Fuck the Source, fuck XXL, fuck any media machine
Or magazine that front on my team
Word to my comrades in the struggle
Peace to HHC for putting me and Necro on their cover
Your favourite rappers are Non Phixion fans
Your wifey is an Ill Bill groupie with my dick in her hand
United and dead-set, these young hoes wanna fuck me
Excited like rednecks at gun shows in Kentucky
I rock soccer stadiums in Bogota
Saw ten thousand Colombians screaming, "Non Phixion, god."
Don't be confused, this ain't that bullshit you listen to
We that shit that your bitch fingers her pussy to
Pound that Moog organ, chemical warfare, songs for hardcore goons
The rest of y'all scared
It's that radioactive green chronic in the blunt music
Brooklyn homie, run up and pop you with a gun music
Break it down for the blind, the brainwashed
Religions, politicians and thugs pray to the same god
Bloods and Crips, Democrats, Republicans
Red and blue states to represent the sets they're running with
Other gangs play the game too
A blood named George Bush and his team smoked the entire Hussein crew
Classic example of former friends turned to rivals
Words of the bible inspire murder, turn to survival
Die for your set, bang for Muhammad and Jesus
A shitty public school system and a car that's decent
I'm an American, I need a blowjob and a pizza
So I'll overthrow you for oil, Mastercards and Visas

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
This is a mother fuckin' siege and slaughter, another story of war
A holy vision of the purity and glory before
I warned you before about Leviathan and biochips
And about the second coming of the Messiah shit
About the motherfuckin' mark of the beast
About the CIA distributing the crack in the streets
A savage with beef, leave your body wrapped in a sheet
He from Brooklyn, I'm from Philly, we was trapped in the streets
My rap is complete, with everything from clappers and heat
Pay us homage as you're praying at your enemy's feet
That's why none of y'all can feel the god's real pain
And none of y'all will never know God's real name
Me and Bill is like the lightning and thunder
Like in 1985, Iron Mike and his hunger
A triflin' brother, give me the weed and the 'caine
So I can chop it up in pieces and distribute the pain
I know that that's some ignorant shit to be saying
But if I was you and you was me then you would spit it the same
You viciously maimed, bleeding in a visceral flame
Till your spirit enter in a metaphysical plane[Ill Bill]

First and foremost, a toast to my Mom & my Pop
My daughter and my wife, there’s no one more important in my life
Without them I wouldn’t be alive in the literal sense
And in the mind, they are my inspiration to grind
My reason to live, rest in peace to my grandmothers and my uncles
Y'all molded the person I became and for that I love you
It’s difficult to explain through lyrics how much I miss you
Please accept any success I’ve achieved as a tribute
A testament to your impact
And influence on everything I’ve ever did, you’ll forever live
I never been a religious person but still bear witness to a higher power
Some only pray in their final hour
But I remain grateful for my blessings
Thankful to the most high, for the many gifts whether present
Past or futuristic, blessed to be able to express myself through words
And give thanks using the lyrics

(Interlude)
The winner is…
Ill Bill… number one
I feel very grateful, very humble
I wanna thank everyone
I’ve waited a very long time
I dedicate this to you for believing in me
I just wanna say… thanks… thank you

[Ill Bill]

Secondly I’d like to address where it all popped
From Farragut Road to your block
Gargling booze, and saw god sparking a doob
Marketing crude, sharpening tools, we're martyrs & goon shooters
That shoot constant modern day Goose Gossage
Ice cold though, Siberian summers appear hotter
Quite bold like a Nigerian underwear bomber
Dope war, folklore, coke whore smoke more
Morbid epitaph, Sordid tortured past provoke more
Try to stab me with a knife to be exact
Spitefully attacked, trifling and wack, grimier in fact
Than any award or any rap, any whore or any rat
Close the door on petty crap
Very happy, thankful to my best of friends
Had to cut ties with any of the very many snakes in the grass that left me for dead
Dumped in the river, swept in the ocean
Heavy emotion, stand firm though the end is approaching, I’m open

(Interlude)
The winner is…
Ill Bill… number one
Ladies and gentleman, a real round of applause
Yall appointed me to bring rap justice
I’ve waited a very long time
I dedicate this to you for believing in me
It’s truly fantastic
To show our appreciation for you

[Ill Bill]

Lastly I’d like to thank all my influences
And various inspirational individuals that got me in the music business
I'm a fan first so I appreciate mines
Thanks to my fans, you're my family, I take pride
In your support and every album you bought
Down for life, I love y'all for never doubting your boy
Same way I love LL Cool J and Kiss
One made me wanna rock, the other made me wanna spit
Rick Rubin made me wanna flip em both at the same time
Slayer and Scarface inspired me to write insane rhymes
Thanks to L'Amours in Brooklyn accepting my fake ID
Opened for Sepultura there when I was only 17
Thanks to my band Injustice
Thanks to Ace London Studios for letting us rehearse when we ain’t have nothing
And shouts to all of yall that said I couldn’t do it
You gave me the fire to kick down the door and walk through it

(Interlude)
The winner is…
Ill Bill… number one
I feel very grateful, very humble
And I owe thanks to many, many people
I’ve waited a very long time
I dedicate this to you for believing in me
What more could I say? I wouldn’t be here today if the old school didn’t pave the way
Ill Bill, rap crusader
Rap crusader
Ill Bill, rap crusader
Rap crusader
Ill Bill, rap crusader
Ill Bill, rap crusader(Hook x2)
My brain's strange from taking contaminated acid
While you be selling your soul we assassinate assassins
Am I hallucinating?
You'll see visions of death, possessed
By homicide is what I'm obsessed

Reek of puterfaction and drugs, the acid taste often lingers
Susan Atkins licked the blood of Sharon Tate off her fingers
Off the hand of Satan, hot corpse masturbation
Get my rocks off, sparking a golf course assassination
Pistol whip and kill the rich, triple six
Extremely horrible like a beautiful bitch with a dick
Every society receives the criminals it deserves
Subliminal with the words, and every visual's absurd
Dope dealer storm dancers rain down chronic showers
The cult leader cure cancer with hypnotic powers
Goon druggie tie-dyed psychedelic paint job
Dune-buggy drive-bys, heretics that hate God
Red spider acid tongue, death rider, bastard son
Empire stand as one, Hellfire Canyon Club
Crocodile confessions occupy obsessions
We personify homicide - We're the essence

(Hook x2)

"Death To Pigs" written on the wall in blood
Pestilence and sickness the war's begun
Trippin' in a coffin numb
Lift your tongue, put this underneath
Orange Sunshine, a hundred sheets
Morbid dungeons and demons a hundred deep
Grimy tornado tyrants and independent souls
Hawaii volcano, private Jimi Hendrix shows
I’ve seen the symmetry of infinity clearly, like Timothy Leary weary
Questioning every existing theory
Then we enter to the hallways of the always
Twisted like corn-braids
Trippin' like Grateful Dead tour-dates
I seen Satan and God raping your mom
Then they all melted away in globs and claymation blobs
Simulation, Play Station, X-Box the death doctrine
Altamount angels to murder-sprees with Tex Watson
The shepard sent the lamb to Bethlehem
Pentagon Nephilim, sitting in the center of a pentagram

(Hook x2)[Intro: 'Signs' sample]
The startling footage we're about to show you was photographed
By a 42 year old, Romero Valadares
This video was taken yesterday afternoon at his son's seventh birthday
In the city of Passo Fundo, Brazil
It was sent to the local news bureau there
And sent to us via satellite just a few minutes ago
All initial opinions are, this is genuine
What you're about to see, may disturb you

[Verse 1: ILL Bill]
Murder forensicles surrounded by alternative tentacles
Extraterrestrials step out of starships in pressure suits
Claiming humans were created inside of test tubes
Horrifyingly huge eye sockets resemble head wounds
Pumping the protoplasm, jello like substance
Looking like Goldblum in The Fly but more dusted
Don't trust their reptilian tongue
They come in peace is what they claim
When their true intentions are to have the world in chains
Enslaved, they came from beyond the stars, unexplainable
Religious people thought they coming was a sign from God
They thought these were the Elohim
When the first mothership arrived over the planet, it was a creepy scene
A huge hovering metal structure stretching
For over 5 miles every direction, blocking perception
Every news channel, 24 hour coverage, stopping commercials
Doctors, experts, UFOs, crop circles
Arguing generals in closed door meetings
Religious cults claiming to know the meaning of these beings
Many of these cults claimed to have been abducted, probe prodded
And fist fucked and caught in the tracker beam and lifted up
Into the lab, strapped to a table, made to endure a series of tests Pushing beyond the limits of stress
Waking up in a cornfield naked, barely alive
Every inch of your body's in pain, you barely survived
Millenniums ago, star maps were drawn in sand
The meanings of the pyramids has long tortured man
Pharaohs and Hebrews, Mayans and Aztecs
Mathematically perfect architects the many gods have blessed
Hieroglyphics become the blueprint of primal physics
Pyramids buried kings, queens, tribal clerics
Radar signals from space bouncing off burnt rock
Responsible for the travelling Alien Workshop[Ill Bill]
I eat politicians for breakfast
Till infinity it's endless
Bill and Hillary, George Bush, everybody's gettin it
Presidents, Supreme Court Justices, and Senators
Run up in the White House
Erase people, edit them
Press delete, hit em in the chest with heat
Hail to the chief
Bullets everywhere, its beef
Violence is more American than apple pie and Soul Train
Baseball, nickel-plated nines, and cocaine
It's Ill Bill, Non-Phixion
If I offended you with my words I meant it
Protected by the First Amendment
If this was Iraq I'd a been beheaded
Instead of sparkin a Dialogue
I'd be hangin in Baghdad shredded
Yeah I recognize
But if I ever disappear under mysterious pretenses
You guess why
I guess the CIA's trying to die
They wanna terrorize the kid
And fry him alive

(Chorus)
Skinheads and Black hebrews
Punk rockers and Hip-Hoppers
Street pharmacists, drug dealers, witch doctors
Rappers wearing hundred thousand dollar wrist watches
Little kids starving, the police killed his father
Rich man, poor man, civilized man, Tarzan
Who's right? fightin over God's land
American History X
Represent the future
Or know whats next

[Ill Bill]
I leave an ATF truck burning with the passengers in it
Hit it with anti-aircraft missiles with Bill's spid-it
No apologies, asking what's wrong with truth
Tell me whats wrong with the world
I'll tell you what's wrong with you
What's wrong with the youth
Brain eating, corpses, and coupes
Sorcerers and spooks
Luminating torturous kooks
Murdering devils that wear police officer suits
Revolutionaries standing on street corners and stoops
I'm the reason the FBI killed JFK
The reason they have metal detectors at JFK
The reason that the Constitution no longer protects us
They don't even need a reason anymore to arrest us
Living in a state of Martial Law
Learn the arts of war
Arm yourself, marching forth into the monster's jaws
America eats its young, swallow raw
Falling through the doorway of death
Never know what we dying for

(Chorus)

[Ill Bill]
I seen spoiled kids murder they parents with shotguns
Poor kids from the hood sellin they mom's drugs
A lost generation of fools
Without a clear destination
No guidance, no rules, no education
And the older generation's no better
Matter of fact they worse
They oughta know better
These greedy motherfuckers trade blood for oil
An American graveyard on another man's soil
Makes no sense
The Roman Empire in the present tense
Murder for corporations that they represent
Whether Democrat or Republican
The same scumbag government
With scumbag ways of runnin shit

(Chorus)
(x2)[Verse 1]

[Ill Bill]

I’m like a Viking in a submarine, I’m a Spartan with guns and beams
Muggs and me is like giving hard drugs to fiends
I be the cause of this prison riot, spawn of the Israelites
Torture you with kitchen knifes, caught you in a pistol fight
I saw prophets tore from the fist of Christ
Propaganda brainwashes us to make us think their system’s right
I stick my finger in the dyke, plug the leak
While she sucked her teeth, look into the light, such is life

[B-Real]

So when I hold the mic frighting day and night
Might catch a case, see you in my sights, let my heater make you change your face
Make you change your ways, wishing you could change your days
The venom we spit cut your throat like a razor blade
They got hell to pay, me I got hell to raise
Looked death in the eye, he said you get a stellar gaze
He went on his way but he got stuck in the maze
Without any way to get out of this purple haze

[Hook: Ill Bill]

Evacuate the place, fallen angel, amputated saint
Trapped on a cannibal planet of hate, gang-related is their faith
Activate the tape, calculate the weight
Single-handed with the cannon in their face

Evacuate the place, fallen angel, amputated saint
Trapped on a cannibal planet of hate, gang-related is their faith
Activate the tape, calculate the weight
Single-handed with the cannon in their face

[Interlude: Ill Bill]

Abandon all hope, buy more weapons and more coke
Build yourself a bunker under your house, it’s all over
But before the CIA come to take us away
Light up some OG kush and take us out in a blaze

Abandon all hope, buy more weapons and more coke
Build yourself a bunker under your house, it’s all over
But before the CIA come to take us away
Light up some OG kush and take us out in a blaze

[Verse 2]

[Ill Bill]
I ate some brownies last week and I’ve been high for days
Should’ve known B-Real was the guy with the tray
Cheech and Chong spliff, twist up an entire eighth
It won’t freeze your nose, the shit’ll set fire to your face

[B-Real]
We get higher in the place, still my eyes are clean
I’m the man in all black with the hashisheen
So many bags of green candy cars that lean
Got a crew so thick man we causing a scene
You tried to hit it the very moment I lit it
You shitted your pants, coughing out your lungs, bitch quit it
We got the greenery and the heavy machinery
And life don’t mean a thing to me, bitch enjoy the scenery

[Hook][Intro: Howard Jones]
Imagine you were given one hour
Exactly sixty minutes and zero seconds to put your entire life
And the world around you in total perspective
What would you say? What would it sound like?

[Choir music (By The Waters of Babylon)]
By the waters the waters of Babylon
We lay down and wept and wept for Thee Zion
We remember we remember we remember Thee Zion

[Ill Bill]
We've unraveled the Bible code, the rifle explodes
Demand attention like a knife in your throat
They're controlling the price of your soul
Titans of stone, psychic totalitarian
Biotelemetric mind control experimentation is various
Narcotics made to inflict pain and madness
Assassins with multiple personalities
Active with full access
A backstage pass to cover up spectacular assassinations
And arms deals across the axis
Another witch hunt, religious radicals with big guns
Big plans, invisible cameras built in Japan
CIA behaviour control scientists in the cults
And formed an alliance of cult leaders, also their clients
Tech-savvy hijacker associates bought planes
To practice, anxiously awaiting their global audience
Enter the core, I feel this with ease
The ultimate reality series, loaded with cameras, angles, and theories
Now hear me

[Hook]
A golden helmet blinded minds
Among ten thousand swords
Along the road to Babylon
A golden thunder silenced songs
Among ten thousand voices
On the road to Babylon

[Ill Bill]
This operation doesn't exist
The revolution will be classified
Live broadcast from the abyss
Our cities are crack spots and cardboard condominiums
Vicious and trackmarks cross minds lost in delirium
The towers dropped, blind fools, confusion who knew?
Now the world watch Saddam's execution on Youtube
Propaganda machines wage media Jihad
A teen walking to a crowded movie theatre with bombs
Reading the Qur'an, silently obedient to God
Known by many different names: Hashem, Jesus, and Allah
Exploding porn, shadow government protocols
Go to war amongst ten thousand voices on the road to Babylon
Patriot Act, sanctioned exorcism
Iranian and North Korean-built weapon systems
Budgets increase to payroll hundreds of creeps
Number of the beast, bomb London under the streets
The engineer was a popular peer
His value appeared to having nuclear weapons just shower the air
A thin line between power and fear
A martyr in tears, goodbye father
Now my final hour is here, help me

[Hook]Verse 1]

I spit on behalf of my death cult made of millions of morbid angels
Standing in a burning church in Norway lost in hatred
Of course Satan smiles through the face of a child
Whose born with the number of the Devil scraped into his scalp
We don’t like none of y’all at all
My fuck your mother in the mouth type of dawgs might write this song
Triple X bitches call me and invite me home
They run up on me on the street in then invite me dome
I spit the truth for the youth movement, it’s goon music
Engineered to make you bang your motherfucking head to it
Learn ships, live fast lives and spit flames then burn bitches with crackpipes like Rick James
Ill Bill, I’m from Brooklyn where the stars are born
I make drug music plus I be involved in porn
I be the chosen like Robby Benson beyond comprehension
Holding a toaster like Bronson in Death Wish

[Hook x 2]

Black metal, I cock back react thorough
In la botanica con el santero
Black mask, white robe, shrouded in peril
Trapped me in the war between God and the Devil

[Verse 2: Sick Jacken]

I know a babalawo who cuts chicken heads
I fuck chicken heads man that Santeria shit is fucking wild
I’m feeling like my time running out
I’m the middle of the block guns drawn when they gun it down
I break speed limits on the highway to Hell
They got the Devil chasing me trying to give me life without bail
I drink spirits and smoke form for medicine
And inhale elements of sickle cell
You can catch me in the hood like VD
That Sixth Side Street shit homes and we ain’t deal with the PD
The most hated on the block with no greatest
Crash through the storm and attack the storm raiders
I shoot the shit with Shaman, my spirit is still starving
Imagine all the shit that my soul famine is causing
Knife-carving nine on the psychos at night swarming
I fight to be righteous but the murder is more calm

[Hook x 2]

[Verse 3: Q-Unique]

I been forced to fulfill a dark and hateful agarro
And was born the son of a Satan santero
Burn black candles for a black Sabbath
After the fact the priest converted her to a crack addict
It’s flat madness with black gats and black magic
Sit and watch the death of faces and laugh at it
With two white pale goth bitches lost in an orgy
And you too could subscribe for the cost of a forty
I got the blood of the faceless pagans on me
A sacred place praying to raise a Haitians army
The Babalawo wolf from Brooklyn in all white
White fitted, white Nikes, moving that pure white all night
Make a bruha scream chango and fuck their brains out
Your ice crucifix won’t save you, tuck your chains now
Between heaven and hell pa’ arriba y pa’ abajo
Knowing the devil itself vamos pa’l carajo

[Hook x 2][Intro]
Ill Bill
Apathy
Brooklyn goons to Snowgoons
Demigodz, LCN
Doe rakers

[Hook] -- Apathy
Watch out where them Snowgoons go
We make the sky bleed black snow
Not after your cash, we're after your soul
We make the sky bleed black snow
Watch out where them Snowgoons go
We make the sky bleed black snow
Not after your cash, we're after your soul
We make the sky bleed black snow

[Verse 1] -- Ill Bill
I'm a diamond in the rough
Leave hollows in the gun
Leave large holes in your skull
Cause you ain't never coming home
You'll never fucking survive
I'm leaving nothing alive
Nobody's gonna escape
Everybody's gonna die
Like the angel of death
Creep up with the four-fives
And chrome nines
No love lost and no smile
No mercy, no retreat
No surrender, coke and heroin
I'm the man on the street
Like a old school metalhead
Riding dirty, mind perverted
Shooting pornos behind the iron curtain
Do more dirt than Tide detergent
Fuck peace, I'm a violent person
My mind's a distorted and fucked-up pile of wires and circuits
Uncle Howie Records there be drugs around me forever
A foundation of terror that rise together
Buck off dimes and motherfuck dames together
We fight til the motherfucking death and die together, La Coka

Chorus

[Verse 2] -- Apathy

Motherfucker I'm Zeus
In a bubble goose with Timberland boots
They try to hang me with a noose
I rip the tree from its roots
You in cahoots with Lhus
Suffer if you got a den of some hating troops
I got a blender full of forbidden fruits
The force of my flows could fracture forty bottles
Got a posse of apostles and pussy from supermodels
I'm a monster in mosh pits, powerful as Pac spits
Launching rockets from Glock clips and my six
The Mossberg moss and that kill sound clash
Only fuck thick chicks with a big round ass
Outlast motherfuckers, I'll be taking out trash
Need to get up, get out, just listen to Outkast
Ap's flows smack foes, jack dough, mack hoes
Spitting rhymes, making dictators resign like Castro
The heavy ammunition is the weapons of choice
Run up on these motherfuckers like, "Sprechen sie Deutsch?"

Chorus[Verse 1: Apathy]
I'm at the opera sitting up in the balcony
Gun aimed at the valkeyrie
Backstage I dabble in black magic & alchemy
Briefcase of cash, passports with a fake name
Traveling through Russia with bombs on a freight train
Turn popes to cokeheads cause they broke bread with goat heads
Paranoid skitzophrenics with no meds
Weaving through the Vatican traffic on a moped
Carrying machine guns, cops scream code red
Command center computers scramble to find intruders
Police scan the local rooftops for sharp shooters
I'm cold as Siberia, flow is so superior
The smell of cigars stain Mercedes interior
The black snow, black hole leader like Castro
I'm sitting in a cemetery poisoning black crows
The mass knows nothing of my fiendish plots
They try deciphering the rhymes that this genius drops
I concoct concoctions to make your heartbeat stop
We're locked in a Russian gulag sleeping on old cots
Guards moving like robots patroling the cellblocks
30 below zero, who the hell said Hell's hot?
I swore to my maker I'd never spit a wack flow
Or spend eternity in Hell shoveling black snow

[Hook: Ill Bill]
Watch out where them Snowgoons go
We make the sky bleed black snow
Not after your cash, we are after your soul
We make the sky bleed black snow

[Verse 2: Sicknature]
The Snowgoons are battering rams through your speaker
Hazardous craft that´ll freeze ya
Earthquaking bangers and them smackers that slap up the sleepers
Landscapes are collapsing when we shatter the sets
We are like the Four Horsemen breathing down the back of your neck
Curtains are met for competition with no further regrets
Have you floating the ocean face down with a bird on your head
I'm leaving rivals flabbergasted, minds can have you backless
That´s why I´ll design my raps to chop heads off like flying battle-axes
Green Mile on beat, killing it, you as relevant as garbage
Stomp through your empire like the elephants of Carthage
Colder than the poles when the notions are woven
Stay in control and always keep one eye open like Odin
When the market is too numb we march to the goon drum
'Till it´s a wrap, leaving you wrapped in a carpet of goosebumps
The storm comes, there´ll be no time for a last phone call
When the dark skies open to let the black snow fall

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Celph Titled]
I got a sinister plot to administer shots
Samurais that let hammers fly, ninjas with Glocks
Bust through brick walls, walk through glass
Terminator Titled, let 'em live, why would I do that?
Dumping everything I got at ya
Don't you think it's odd that I run this shit from Antarctica to Ottawa?
Stuff you in a garbage truck,cause you been trash
Wear your hat straight, but I'll put snaps where your brim at
Make you rock a special needs helmet cause you been wack
Uppercut punch, left you bent back
Halfway up your nose was the chin strap
The doctor handed me some notes and this graph
That said this boy need a skin graft
I don't talk to cops so save that report
My interrogation video's a Charlie Chaplin short
So when you hear the gat blow we comin' through the backdoor
I let the brrrat go repping for Black Snow

[Hook][Raekwon]
Wire cell frames on me, good Nike, yeah
True, alotta chains on, this is how we do the thing, enlight me
Clubbed out, bugged out, this is what them thugs bout
Bust off shotties, knock niggas mother's out
Rolling in them renters in winter, too much bones get bent up
The saw'll eat up, your chrome for dinner
We tasting VS's, very special Cognac since G.S.'s
Now we leaning Louis sneakers and C.L.S.'s
I'm far from your average rapper, yeah Shallah, hit with an actor
Cutting through your time, then slap ya
Yo, you see me on them Smack shits, all of my Skittles on
In black whips, living comfortable in some glass cribs
Word to Jabari, my junior, only two years old
Swimming with the sharks, I'mma feed you tuna
Your pops been a whale since jail
Was taking niggas out to Brazil

[Ill Bill]
Where carnivale mamis is ill
Take me to Paul Wall, buy me a grill
I got groupies, buying me Gucci's and exclusive Nike's, it's real
I stay biz in the kitchen with the Chef Rae-Kwiz
It's easy five mill or I'mma have to take they kids
I figured out how to rape the system, I made more than your album budget
Off of a freestyle, on this mixtape, a hustler
That understand dollars and cents
I get blowjobs from runway models in France
The rap Burt Reynolds, when I married the world troubles
Producing earthquakes, turning ya stone hedge to pebbles
The life we chose, the path we lead, ain't none of us'll
See heaven, that's our own guarantee
Never, rat on your friends, always keep your mouth shut
The back of the Benz, put this in your mouth, slut
I saw, I conquered, I came and I'm out
Laid it out, all on the tonsils, then skeet in her mouth[Verse 1: ~Vinnie Paz~]
This is Taliban rap, I'm a fucking bomber*
My head wrapped like somebody who suffered trauma
Musically I'm the embodiment of Jeffrey Dahmer
Usually in the environment of marijuana
My straight right like Arguello was
You a medigon, Vinnie do what a dego does
You about to find out what the human tornado does
You a bitch, you ain't even half what you say you was
My shit is hard body lord, I'm a fucking legend
I don't get my hands dirty, that's for fucking henchmen
I'm the equivalent of Russian Roulette, fucking tension
And when you hear the ram's horn it's the fucking ending
I'm a vampire, I love the setting of sun
The night my time killing already begun
I'm from the same place Anton Lavey is from
I'm about to put the biscuit right to my head and be done

[Hook: ~Demoz~]
This Perc 10 got me feeling like a brick wall
With that said I give a fuck about a withdrawal
Fuck a quarterback, bullets get you picked off
Critics get pissed on when I'm pissed off

This Percodan got me feeling like a brick wall
With that said I give a fuck about a withdrawal
Fuck a quarterback, bullets get you picked off
Critics get pissed on when I'm pissed off

[Verse 2: ~Demoz~]
1978 my mom had a date
'84 had me, had a hard time great
Mom wasn't weak, I guess my dad wasn't fake
But guessing only led to one thing, my mistakes
That's why I cut the grass real low, check for snakes
Apply pressure when I need to satisfy my weight
Selling coke and the diesel
Fiends going crazy putting dope in their needles, it's hopeless and evil
You can smoke wet and get smoked with the Eagle
All over nothing, fucking pride and your ego
Spit all facts, I ain't gotta mislead you
Talk shit wherever you stand, that's where I leave you
Believe me, I can get you killed real easy
Leave the scene but the ho won't leave me
Tackle the dresser, bitch try to tease me
I put a hole in her head right where her weave be, believe me

[Repeat Hook:]

[Verse 3: ~I'll Bill~]
I'm the bomb attached to the chest of exploding martyrs, code of honours
Shoot me out your M16, deliver souls beyond the world
To conquer planets and enslave entire populations
Colosseums where Hamas supply the operation
Gladiators battle on the side of sovereign nations
Fathers of confrontation, Lamas to pop your face in
Blinded by lies and hatred, they conjure up abomination
Armies march across the continents honouring Satan
The final countdown, 2012
Jumping out the Black Hawk with the black Eagle by the money belt
I take you from the edges of space to the projects
From the pyramids to Giza to where God sits, we monstrous
I'm conscious homie, I'm wide-awake
I supply the hate, La Coka Nostra
The skull and guns, I supply the weight
How many bricks you want? Let me see your money first
As a matter of fact I'm taking your money you fucking herb
Fuck outta here, Billy Idol, La Coka Nostradamus[Ill Bill]
You like to take drugs and hear music, my album is engineered
Like biotechnology, attach me to ya ear
I make the devil do the work of God and God do evil
I'm both positive and negative, I'm like two people
Both from New York, New York, so trife they named it twice
Only idiots is broke, the hood is paved with ice
Paved with gold but never let it rape ya soul
Turn the tables on the dough homie take control
Fuck not eatin' shot the sheriff, made 'em stop breathin'
Anybody that ever fucked with me I got even
Wanna be here hardcore homie but you not leavin'
Starin' down at yourself prayin' maybe you'll stop bleedin'
God hates us all, use your brain to decorate the wall
Put a bullet in ya dome, desecrate ya skull
A world of pain so hot, Bill burst into flames
Psychological, spit it like a person deranged

[Necro]
I'm one of Brooklyn's best sickos, I'm not egotistical
Just statin' facts hollow tip bullets keep the biscuit full
My rap speaks for itself, it's alive
It says fuck with me and I'll have to murder you to survive
There ain't many like me not too many like me
Too many wanna be like me it's not likely
Ya packin' a sword and a bat
But me I'm runnin' across the chessboard with a gat, aimed at ya queen
I don't gotta play this game clean
But I'm a play it like I mean business and I'm a utilize my brain to scheme
Rap been producin' directin' pimpin' an evil thinkin' clappin'
It's gruesome dissections
I started rhymin' in 88 like eighth grade in New York state
The only emotion I displayed was hate
For pigs with gats and kids that rat
Fuck a snitch, you can't blame me for an animal like that

[Q-Unique]
I clash with the mind of a machetero
And laugh if you cryin' when I blast the metal
March with an army of darkness until ya shotty go shot less
With a cock that'll make ya mommy drop topless
Write a bible quote with his blood on the wall
Another horror flick victim is just, runnin' to fall
Now the FBI say that theirs a nut on the crawl
It's Q the fuckin' maniac, brought a gun to the brawl
Pop the tow truck cop from my automobile
Then slide up in the club and party with my portable steel
Violence for the violent consumer, keep ya ear to the beat
Ya eyes glued to the luger and true to the herd
Hopin' to hurt ya fancy life
Cuz I paid taxes and vote for the anti Christ
Unholy trinity, vacate the whole vicinity
Scrappin' dignity and quickly take the hoes virginity

[Gortex]
Gore’s back, the fourth Zodiac, sharpshooter, top of the pack
I keep it poppin' like I'm thrown in Iraq
Y'all know the cults back, the most hated with the sickest flow
Control freak handin' out cups like I was Jim Jones
Bury the rubble, half y'all live in the bubble
Fakin' my own death to forge passports and body doubles
Flash to 86, bubble coats toast and sneakers
Slay ya wrists, keep the posse thick, ropes and beepers
Dead celebrities, real life ain't as dope as the movies
Mental funeral the trauma unit since it was juvis
Out the hood groupies, coke head thugs and rock cuties
Motley Crue sluts love to chew cock and cop boobies
Swing the war hammer, see me on tour flyin' the Gor banner
The pigs tryin' to catch me out shoppin' I'm so modest
The gods are metal so consider the dream
Elvis is dead and 2Pac, he livin' in Queens[Intro]
{*people screaming*}
On the floor, now, NOW! Do it, do it
{*gunshot*}
On the floor, now, NOW!

[Raekwon]
Oh shit~! It's on huh?
(Aiyyo sit your boney ass the fuck down)
(We not fuckin playin in here)
This is a stick up, nobody move, get on the floor
Get on the walls, take your sneakers off, take off your drawers
Cover your dick, bitches be quiet, don't say shit
You move - I'mma make sure I clap you and ya clique
All my gunnies is squeezin
Listen to me, before you die, just leave with my cheese
I ain't playin I'm sprayin, off top, doors is locked
Fuck around, try to run around, you greasy
Don't even dare - put your cell phone down dear
Before I put my gun in your ear
I'm not a new jack, an Iker or a jerk with a pump
I'm straight sober, I'mma feed my ratchet and hunt
We kill Willies, still hillbillies don't call us nuttin else
Might have to melt your Phillies
You old man, sit down - tie up his hands
And yo smack flames out him, get more and then blamp him

[Interlude]
Don't move! Don't fuckin move!
Put your hands in the air, put your hands in the air
Get 'em up!! Get on your knees
Get on your knees, GET ON YOUR KNEES
Gimme that fuckin bag man
Gimme that shit you're my fuckin wife man
Get the fuck out

[Ill Bill]
This bitch started blowin me in the safe
Her fantasy to fuck a bank robber so I blew a load in her face
I knew her from Canarsie, used to work at Chase Manhattan
Smiled when I walked in wavin the ratchet
An inside job, the best kind, the rest I rob
Stay on the ground or you'll be laid to rest by God
I seen big face hundreds and bearer's bonds
I also see cameras on, I'm glad I wore my ski mask camouflage
Listen to "Lamb of God" while I packed the bong
While I studied how to disable a bank alarm
We got three minutes, handle the job; I'm standin on top
Of the counter with the chopper barrel starin at y'all
Why you pussies bleedin all on my money you fuckin up my hundreds
Don't get your fuckin head kicked on some dumb shit stupid
We the future of this bank robbin industry
Kidnap the judge and get a hundred years conspiracy

[Outro]
Everybody in the vault, get out, move!
{*screaming*} On the floor, now, NOW, do it, do it
On the floor, now, NOW!

Never doubt your God, children singing songs about Jihad
Explosions that blow cars over buildings from afar
We the children of a bloodstained revolution
Gun bang, forever shoot and run fam, get your Uzi love thing
Retribution Timberland boots, leather gooses
In the undisclosed black bulletproof with the extra shooter
Bought a box of banana clips from these anarchists
Like Tim Osman commanding the ship on dialysis
More pain more gain, 9/11 was a war game
More enemies, more friends, more fame
Listen to propaganda cock the hammer
We can stop a man but how do you destroy an army that’s a phantom?
How do you kill a militia that’s invisible?
Mystical, peep what official pistols do, kid we invincible
How do you stop the unstoppable, unkillable?
The salvation of God, now sit back and listen to the song y’all

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
I heard children sing Allahu Akhbar in Turkey
One had a Russian AK, dirty Iverson jersey
I don’t know if it made me proud or if it disturbed me
I guess it’s not as bad as kids being fucked by the clergy
Kufi on, Glock cocked moving through the palace
A dead Kennedy in California Über Alles
I’ll drink a quart of virgin blood inside a Buddha chalice
I took the head off a Kennedy from the roof in Dallas
Yeah I wish that Ron Paul ran again
If not then I’mma have to take the lead like Jeff Hanneman
(Seasons of the abyss) y’all falling for the trap again
.38 leave your fucking body like a mannequin
Yeah if Billy blast at you I blast with him
We don’t live in a republic, it’s just fascism
The Louvre isn’t a museum, it’s a glass prison
Fuck a class system, listen to the song y’all[Verse 1: Slaine]

Yeah, yeah, check it out
Antidepressants and anti vibe nose candy tan yon high
Red huffy bike propping nanny on the handle bars
I push the dukes of hazard big wheeled, pulled the brake
Chase the ice cream truck down the street
Full mistake
Caught a cramp fat boy style since a young-in
Ketchup stains on my shirt look what I’m becoming
Reagan got shot, Bush became president later
Clinton got his dick sucked, Ken style was a hater
About your pose voice drop
Yeah, got an oct to blow
Luger ?
My socks when i rocked them yo
[plaguer ribbed sugar raiser ? hotdog]
The fix is in
The best cars are made right in Michigan
Listening to Beastie Boys on cassette deck from a boom box
Pedophile rumors from the king with the moonwalk
Moms calling out my name I ain’t in for dinner yet
TVs with antennas that was way before the internet

[Hook x2]

Look at the news on the TV as the world turns
I saw the world change and the World Trade burn
I don’t believe in hardly any thing but evolution
They should have killed us all the children of the revolution

[Verse 2: Ill Bill]

Yo, guidos rocking Pete Rose hairdos and speedos
While scarface schooled us all on how to move was a kilo
We went from rocking Michael Jackson and Hall and Oats
To rocking 8balls jackets and 8balls of coke
Seen the 80s when the dukie truck chains was called ropes
And Dapper Dan splashed Gucci logos on all of his clothes
Reaganomics was popping
So was Riker’s Island and Spofford
In 87’ 88’ half of my projects was locked up
Same time as Iran contra and Ollie North
Dreams of Def Jam profile, tommy boy
Ralph McDaniels in the afternoon passed the shrooms
Light the weed catch me in the apartment 2c
Playing Break Street on my Commodore 64
Listening to break beats. Mr. Magic and Marley Marl
Either that or a new 68
The world turns while the revolution's viewed with a shifty face

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Slaine]
People man DJing in a park with the lethal hands
Puerto rican man
Jamaican playing with puerico grands
Gorbatchev birth mark on he’s head, the wars off
Slayer and Metallica besides that his sword is soft
Met a wise public enemy
Voice of the ghetto vizor
Evolution of a revolution is televised
Bin laden in the CIA now they telling lies
Escobar, King in South America and selling pies

[Verse 4: Ill Bill]
The devils rise as another empire falls
The enterprise allies on weaponized fire balls
At first claiming a high cause
As soon central lies intelligence reveal their bottom plans on then I ain't yours
We went from innocence to cynicism
From heavy metal lyricists to hip pop lyricism
From animation to live action, suspended animation
To sleepers cells To Manchurian assassins

[Hook x2]
