[Hook]
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer
Swagger down pat, call my shit Patricia
Young Money militia and I am the commissioner
You no wan' start Weezy cause the 'F' is for finisher
So misunderstood, but what's a world without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time, synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin, what a fuckin' family picture
You know Father Time, and we all know Mother Nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buyin', I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds, fuck segregation
Fuck that shit, my money up, you niggas just Honey Nut
Young Money runnin' shit and you niggas just runner-ups
I don't feel I done enough, so I'mma keep on doin' this shit
Lil Tunechi or Young Tuna Fish

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I'm goin' back in
Okay, I lost my mind, it's somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you don't understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy
Just talked to Moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up, call it self-defense
Swear, man, I be seein' through these niggas like sequins
Niggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end
Talkin' to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, fuck the world, that's adultery
You full of shit, you close your mouth and let yo' ass talk
Young Money eatin', all you haters do is add salt
Stop playin', bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp, I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these motherfuckers talkin' crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall: outfielder
You know I'mma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playin', I do it like a king do
If these niggas animals, then I'mma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothin', you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money
Paper chasin', tell that paper, "Look, I'm right behind ya"
Bitch, real G's move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep so I can't find her
You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag you would kill for
Money too strong, pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishin' well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell

[Verse 3: Cory Gunz]
Word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean, get some Dramamine
Llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend
I played the side for you niggas that's tryna front, and see
Son of Gun, Son of Sam, you nigga's the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
Disturb me, and you'll be all over the flo' like Luda
Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bold like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be mackin', 'bout my stackin', now I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backin' out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler
Wayne, these niggas out they mind
I done told these fuck niggas so many times
That I keep these bucks steady on my mind
Tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause
To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love
Keep throwin' my sign in the middle
Hit 'em up, piece on my side, cause ain't no peace on my side, bitch
I'm a man, I visit urinals with pride
Tune told me to, I'm shootin' when the funeral outside
I'm uptown, thoroughbred, a BX nigga, ya heard? GunnaTRANSCRIBING, WILL BE UP SHORTLY

[Verse 1: Lil Twist]
The South Side, the South Side, these bitches' mouth wide
Can't trust a pig, informant nigga, run the cop wired
They set us up, then book me up, you crooked fuck
Get to the jail, tell them bitches to look me up
I'm on top of my shit, Red Bottoms like how my shoe tastes
Standin' from where I'm at, the licro is my shoe lace
I chunk a deuce, pour a four all inside an eight ounce
I'm faded now, finna cut a ho off like K Camp
TMZ on my dick, they swear they can knock me off, shit
Harvey better chill 'fore niggas run in his office
Write our own article, tell the people who caused it
Faggot tried to hide, first spot we shot is the closet
Crazy mothafucka, Mossberg in the moshpit
Ever since I hit LA, I'm wildin' on my Pac shit
B.I.G., "Who Shot" shit, or Jay on his Roc shit
"Wop Wop," "Drop It Like It's Hot," "Block Is Hot" shit

[Verse 2: Hood]
Fat Fly Nigga, landing on your runway
Got the work coming, I'm the black Mickey Monday
Snowflake fresher than the morning on a Sunday
I ain't a killer but my homie with the gun play
He the typa kid go to school and kill the lunch La-dy
Damn, crazy right? We the typa kids live a crazy life
We get money, fuck bitches, rock crazy ice
And it's Young Money Records, ho, I'm really with D'wayne
In the club drunk trippin' yelling "Bitch, I'm Mack Maine!"
Boy's insane, top down in the rain
Holding up traffic, shootin' dice in your lane
Niggas shot me in my back, but I'm back bro
No we not a Jack boy, we done jacked bro
Started sellin' crack, now a nigga sellin' crack flows
Meet me in the trap, I'll be right by the back door
You can get a Bow Wow, you can get a Fat Joe
You can get finessed, I'm from Dallas, boy, it's natural
You can get it all for a real pretty penny
Niggas in the hood cookin' chickens, eatin' Denny's
Hoody

[Verse 3: Euro]
Compare me to who? Compare me to what?
Compare me to them, I'm 100, I'm not like them
I'm talkin', been hustlin' before I seen her
Rick Ross video in that off-white Beamer
I'm at the bar taking shots of nightmares with dreamers
Shoot for the stars, hope the moon ain't [?]
Stepped in the game and I spit that ether
And I ain't leaving 'til I blow, funny, these hoes ain't either
Listen, it's February, leaves enough time for me
So by December, I should be a millionaire at least
The least, take my word, this the year I beast
And if not, y'all can kill me by New Years Eve, please

[Verse 4: Flow]
Rollin' blunts while I'm listening to my Jigga disc
Smokin', flickin' ashes from the tip of the pyramid
Dressed in black growing up, horns for my membership
White kid listened to my song then he slit his wrist
I have a nightmare to stop you niggas from dreaming
I never read the bible, but I watch angel and demons
The devil after me? Well fuck it, I'm anxious to meet him
But shhh, shhh, just keep it secret
If I join this force would people stop hatin'?
Should I rap like this to join a Roc Nation
Flow cold like I'm rapping while I'm ice skating
Somebody get me an apron, all of my time wasting
I keep it dirty like Chucks, plus I'm a little Gothic
I spit curses and spells and black nail polish
I fuck gypsies and witches, all of my pals' monsters
Smarter than 12 doctors, sharper than nail filers
Call Satan like fuck it, show me how hell look
I take a nun, then I fuck her like a werewolf
I have no heart, no soul, only these spell books
You niggas' bitches and hoes minus the girl looks
I paint pictures with lyrics so y'all can see my thoughts
Now follow me, in my evil voice
Tweet, Young mother fuckin' Money
These my mother fuckin' brothers, not my fuckin' hubbies

[Verse 5: Cory Gunz]
Militia nigga, you know the name
Cory Gunz, remember my pops era, the son of Dame
The fuck is he supposed to call it
The closer the call is, the closer you going
I'm claustrophobic, your swagger is (?)
Mine is poison, I cough a lotus
Walk New York and show this off
Awesome assault aerobics
You could 80 billion chinups, billion dips and a zillion situps
I stomp you where you at, til' you (?) what it was
Keep me from creeping down the strip bored
Hit for it, jigsaw, clip board
Then I rip your bungees at the zip cord
Pardon my lip lord, can I get my (?)
(?)
Goons smoking (?), lining it raw
Who want it with us
Let me know if its beef nigga
I hope you got the coco leaf or clover leaf
Ain't no competing with these
Niggas from boogie to bang bang boogie
Ain't gangbang for chains, stings, cookies and brains hang
Anythang
Anybody looking to bring pain, maintain
Anybody looking to say name, stay sane
Anybody looking to play games
Ain't wild or worthwhile
Nigga just stay tame

[Verse 6: Gudda Gudda]

[Verse 7: Lil Wayne]
Smoke, sex, skate, shoot
Boy we turnt up like breakin' news
Let the kids live, baby, dude
Blood all in the fuckin' baby food
The cradle too, shoot the dog once
Turn around, tell the kids, "Stay in school"
Leave out the house, neighbors peekin' out the windows
Show the pistol to the neighbors and the neighbors move
I don't give a fuck about a nigga's caregiver
I be with them niggas that'll fuck their stepsister
I be with them niggas that'll kill your caregiver
I'll do Brazilian wax on a hair trigger
Lord I think I need a hitman
Tell Biggie I'm a big fan
My pockets on Biggie Smalls
Your pockets on stickman
I just came from the gun store
I spent about 10 grand
Now the parents wearin' black clothes
And got your homies wearin' shit bags
Think I need a hitman
'Bout to go kidnap a rich man
If he don't give it up we chop him up
And send his body parts to his house gift wrapped
I think I need a hitman
I can't trust the next man
Thank Lord for my weedman
But right now we're playin' phone tag
I'm doin' 40 down the boulevard
I told my homie he gon' take the charge
He got the Tommy and I got the MAC
And on your head they got a contract
I thank you for my hitman
And tell Pac I'm a big fan
I sang "Dear Mama" to my dear mama
And sang "Hit Em Up" to my daddy's bitch ass
I thank you for my hitman
'Bout to go kidnap the big man
As you can see I got big plans
Big plans to be the big man
40 down the boulevard
With my homies, they gon' take the charge
Say, "It's nothin', boy I got your back"
Because them other niggas copy cats
I thank you for my hitman
This for all my fans that been fans
I'm so sorry, I'm so fuckin' sorry
I'm so sorry for the weight like Slim-Fast
Stick MDMA up a bitch ass
AT&T, ass, tongue and tit man
Oh, oh shit, man
Your pockets on stickman

[Verse 8: Lil Wayne]
It talk like a killer, it walk like a killer
It must be a killer, I must be a killer
Hustlin' Priscilla straight out of the villa
I got more customers shoppin' at Dillards
Don't fuck with these niggas, I don't know their names
Fuck these niggas, I don't give a damn
Fuckin' with Wayne, Talkin' to Wayne
You talkin' to Wayne is like talkin' to flame
22 pop for a brick in the drought
You can't buy the chicken then please chicken out
Or if you snitchin' we will sniff it out
You'll get found at your house, put your dick in your mouth
Dope, skinny ass sweats
Got a strap wear that bitch on my back
I walk in the mall with that shit on my back
With my bitch hollerin' 'bout, "I want this, I want that"
Ooh, mulah
Like la, la, la, la, la, la Too much Cubana up in me cabana
Too much white china and Columbiana
That Columbiana, Zoë Saldaña
Fuck, hollup
I'll be right back, keep the lights on, baby
Leave the lights on, baby
Them niggas play, they'll get wiped off, baby
Like Lysol, baby
I pull up on a bitch wearin' one .38
Put a bitch nigga on First 48
Fuck a bad bitch in the first 24
She take off all her clothes, say she sorry for the wait
Put her legs on a nigga like a hula hoop
I go between her legs like we shootin' hoops
I break a chicken down to some noodle soup
I buy a Rolls Royce like a Subaru
I buy a Rolls Royce like a Subaru, bitch

[Verse 9: Lil Wayne]
Wait bitch, I've been on
Top of my shit, I've been thinkin' 'bout shit
All this lean in my punch got me lickin' a mothafuckin' fist
Lord please don't let my ice melt
Muhfuck these dog hoes
But this 9 on my right leg
Times get hard, nigga I could sell crack to a white egg
Sell wrong to a right end
Nigga it's Carter time and niggas horrified
It's glorified in this bitch
Prioritized and immortalized
I'm on the borderline and it's thin
Hold up I'm lightheaded like a kite, baby
I might, maybe, get life, baby
My light shady, my rice, gravy
My nights daily, my life's crazy
Lil Tunechi, bitch[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Cut the music up

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
YMCMB, bitches call me Tunechi Li
I be with niggas that shoot police, I keep that iron, you can get creased
And if she say she didn't fuck, bitch ya lying through ya teeth
They say it cost to be the boss, the ones in jail wish they were free
Niggas call me Hi-C because I'm high as you can see
Niggas say they paid they dues, well I'm checkin' your receipt
Might as well go stupid since this is a stupid beat
Grab the owl out the tree, and ask that bitch, who but me?
Got ya bitch bent over nigga, hands to her feet
Tell that pig and that cow I'll go ham if it's beef
Cause all my niggas well rounded, don't fuck with none of these square niggas
Mask on, Ghostface Killah, draw down and erase niggas

I hit it sideways, catacorner then she catch that nut like pneumonia

[Intro]
Racks on racks on racks

[Hook]
Got campaign going so strong
Getting brain when I’m talking on the phone
Spending money when you're runnin' this long
Real street nigga, ain't no clone

Racks on racks on racks
Racks on racks on racks
Ain't even tryna hold back

Smokin’ on 1,000 dollars of strong
We"re in the club ’bout to hear this song

[Verse 1: YC]
Still fresh as hell in my Trues
Iced out, okay cool
Strapped up, know I keep that tool

I’m about to glow, me on TV
Everywhere you look, you see YC
Hating-ass niggas just wishing they were me
YC, YC, YC
Way too big for my my fucking jeans
I’m so fly I don’t even got wings
Eyes real low, just blame it on the green
Girl cut up, got lean on lean
That shoebox shit, over with
Spend 100 racks, won’t notice it
My bank account, commas all over it
Racks on racks on racks

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
Young, if it’s convertible, then how is it a hardtop
Bitch, I hit one button, my roof open like a hard spot
Make me throw my diamonds up, bitch, my life was hard knock
Had so much kush and Ciroc, bitch, I think my heart stop
Every night’s a weekend, every day’s a Friday night
You ain’t seen nothing yet, bitch, this just my Friday ice
87, brick fare, yeah, I’m talking thirty racks
All I sold is hundos, where the fuck my twenties at

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Racks on, racks off, see that blonde strip when my hat’s off
Lookin’ at my Rollie, ’bout thirty grand what that cost
Smoke like I’m in Cali, fuck takin’ flight, I blast off
Niggas talkin’ tattooes, we should have a tat-off
Got racks on racks on racks, naps on naps on naps
Just made a mill, count another mill, so put that on top of that
Way back in 2004, I told ‘em it was a wrap
Now my life ain’t my life no more, I told you niggas, a wrap
You claim you a dog, my nigga, I’m the vet
We can’t even talk ‘less you got the check
I guess that’s why all of these niggas get bent
They said, fuck a young nigga, fuck a young nigga
I know it’s some girls in the crowd right who wanna fuck a young nigga
I roll one and roll another one bigger
Niggas thinkin’ they sick, well, I’m sicker
Right, I’m smoke my weed and I’m a drink my liquor
Better make sure you fuck your girl right ‘fore I dick her down

[Verse 4: Waka Flocka Flame]
I got racks on top of racks, stacks on top of stacks
Bands on top of bands, got me fuckin’ her and her friends
Backwoods don’t do papers, that was just for my haters
Clap two times if you drunk
Got a bad bitch from the U.K
She do everything I say
Go crazy when she hear music
She got Grove St. on replay
Got racks you don’t understand
Money long from here to Japan
Know it good when she go no hands
Girl, you got me in a trance

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Cyhi Da Prynce]
Got racks on racks on racks, y’all rap so wack on wax
Purple by the pound, that’s that Flacco, haaaa
I make big plays, I got big chips
Blew money like six Crips
Switch gears like stick shifts
Fresh as hell, I'm Big Gipp
We buy cars, y’all flip whips
Catch us smokin’ that Quik Trip
Pitch piff, that’s a handspring
I like to call that a quick flip
Pull triggers like hamstrings
Boy, I’m doin’ my damn thing
Been blood with them bricks, pimp
Get off a key like I can’t sing
Got the seven on me like Vick jersey
Ridin’ round, and this bitch dirty
I’m the best, hands down
They nicknamed me 6:30
And we Young Dose and YC
Redan road, that’s my street
Ask around on the Eastside
I’m the S, h-i-t

[Verse 6: Bun B]
Bun B, I’m underground king
In the candy-painted car on swang
With the top on drop and the trunk on pop
Boy, you can’t tell me a damn thang
Fifth wheel on the back just hang
Hit corners, hit licks, hit stains
With the grill in the front, wood wheel in the blunts
You’re on neon lights in my bank
Yeah, I rep that P-A-T
One hundred, yeah, that’s me
If you don’t recognize, you gon’ see
I’m a straight-up trill OG
In a black-on-black-on-black
Cadillac, like a Mack on clacks
Try to jack and I will attack
It’s a fact that I ain’t givin’ up my stacks like that

[Verse 7: B.o.B]
Call me Bobby Ray, but it’s not two names
Flyin’ through the city, all-black, Bruce Wayne
No, not bombs over Baghdad
But on the track you can call me Usain
That’s why they nervous, hmmm, like I’m flying on the plane with a turban
But I’m fly, y’all just turbulence, exit row, emergency (Mayday!)
As a kid, I was struck by lightning, it’s no wonder I’m electrifying
Fuck a brainstorm, I’ll fuck around and cause a power outage
And it ain’t no rivals, if it was, it’d be no survivors
Just gimme a hour, I’ll light it up like an Eiffel Tower

[Verse 8: Yo Gotti]
Got bales on top of bales, scales on top of scales
I’m Mr. All White, got yay on top of yay
Got pills all on my phone, these niggas know I’m wrong
Said fifty for a song, and they won’t leave me alone
Gotta front me a brick, that ain’t nothin’ to you
Just ran through a ticket, that ain’t nothing to do
Yeah, I love these streets like I love the booth
Mr. Cocaine Muzik, I’m 100 proof
Got white on white on white, ice on ice on ice
And when I’m in the club it look like lights on lights on lights

[Hook]

[Verse 9: Wale]
Racks on racks on racks, I’m tryna smash and not call back
My name Wale, you so silly, wet my willie, might call you a cab
Yeah, riding around with that reefer scent
Riding around with Ms. Reece and them
When I’m in the groove, I can freak a tune
I’m smoother than alopecia skin
I shows out, like dope when I put that flow down
Like soap when I put my clothes on, I’m joking but I be foamed out
And all she want is more bags, but all I want is more 1s
I told her, bring that money back like all them racks is Nordstrom’s

[Verse 10: Cory Gunz]
The tracks on snack off raps, see stacks from back of my slacks
From X to the max in the Ac, if I ain’t strapped, then the gat’s on scat
Then he black on em like Tae-Bo, then he clap on ‘em like bravo
Throw sacks on ‘em like y’all hoes, got racks on em like Tahoes
Young Money, Cash Money so strong, keep scorin’, I’ma bring it on home
Those Xans and the lean cause zones, somethin’ tan with a mean jawbone
Worldwide, but I got fourth ways, one hat carry like four blades
Petey Pop Off, RIP, free Lou, been lootin’ money since like fourth grade
I’m the shit nowadays, so they wave, no whips, no chains, I’m a slave
Let you niggas know Milita my gang, MCN if you was thinkin’ it’s a game
See me with the twin, buck a shimmy with the gauge
Wasn’t bustin’ Jimmy, I’d be busy gettin’ paid
Goin’ for the grips every day ’til the grave
I be worried about the chips, you be worried about the lays

[Verse 11: Dose]
Got Activist in my Sprite, Benjamins in my Robins
Frank Muller wit’ flooded ice, but I still got my breitling
In the fast lane, gettin’ slow brain in a 2012 Maserati
I’m kickin’, pimpin’, like Liu Kang, my coupe smokin’ like Friday
Puffin’ on that garlic, cigar full of Marley
Inked up on my hands and arms, got them jams in my pocket
Shout out to Sha Money, signed me in a hurry
Daddy was a kingpin, a couple milli buried
Nigga, you ain’t talkin’ nothin’, all in Flight Club stuntin’
These exclusive 7s, pay 400 for the Jordans
No, you can’t afford ‘em, sharper than a swordsman
Racks on racks, our campaign strong, and YC like my brother

[Verse 12: Cory Mo]
Catch me in the city with the trunk on crack
Top dropped down, black on black
Fistful of wood, twisted for the good
Check my bank account, got racks on racks
Look around, fool, got a wall full of plaques
Platinum and gold, you gots to love that
Posted up just like a thumbtack
Better hide ya ho, ’cause she bound to get snatched
H-Town, Texas to ATL
She got a fat ass, she prolly know me well
Keep it on the low, never kiss and tell
True player, Cory Mo cold as hell
Shows to do, got record to sell
Got a whole lotta BMI checks in the mail
If ballin’ was a crime, I’d be in jail
Locked up for double life like “What the hell?”

[Hook]

[Verse 13: Nelly]
Yeah, they call me Country Grammar
My brother out the slammer
I’m crimson color painted
You can call that Alabama
I’m not from Alabama
But check out how I roll tide
He might have the same whip
But check out how I roll mine
Y’all niggas ain’t no stars
Y’all only in it for the cars
The sky is your limit, mayne
And mine somewhere bout Mars
I ride with them boys in the middle of the map
St. Louis, Detroit, Chi-town, Nap
Down through the Dirty, back up through the trap
But the money don’t stack, man money overlap
Yeah, y’all better watch it, mayne, right here we lock and load
Two things is for certain, mayne and one thing is fa sho’
Got a house on hundred acres
I’ve never seen my neighbors
A chick in ATL and from Buckhead to Decatur
Now y’all better leave me alone, got license for my chrome
Police on your mama phone, talking bout your baby gone
Tell the truth, I ain’t gon’ lie, I got so many rides
Don’t know which one I’ma drive, fuck it, I’m just gone fly

[Verse 14: Twista]
Everybody wanna hate because I’m on
Blowing head back, bottles by the zone
Twista finna get up on the track
And spit it the way I do simp-a-ly because I like this song
When I step up out the Maserati car
Gotta pull it, pull it, pull it, pull it from the jar
Then I blow, I’ma close out the par
Wit’ some killers and everybody know who we are
Get Money Gang stepping through the door, Chi-cago, cago, cago
Anybody wanna get into it, come on
And do it, for security, we gon’ make a pit a flow
Might as well get it off yo’ chest
While everybody got ammunition on deck
I don’t see them T-Dum-Izzle as a threat
Cause I got racks on racks on racks
Oh, Twista, I see your future, finna shoot ya
I salute you if you could get at the general in military
Racks and racks and tracks and stacks and gats
I could destroy an entire village when I kill and bury
‘Cause I manipulate your molecular structure
Other words, fill ‘em up wit’ holes
If you try to give it to me at the door
I just thought I had to let you know

[Verse 15: Big Sean]
(I bet your bitch call me Big)
I got single bitches tryin’, married bitches lyin’
I take ‘em to the crib and leave our future in a condom
I wake up fresher than these motherfuckers as is
Look inside my closet
That shit look like it’s Raks Fifth
Man, that’s racks on racks on racks on top of packs on top of pounds
My chains is pow on pow on pow
I’m off them trees, no I ain't no owl
I’m at the altar sayin’ my vows, to this Benjamin Franklin pile
You buy her a house, I won’t buy her a vowel
You fell in love and I fell in her mouth
Then called her Dickface, she call the connect
You call her collect, I call to collect, no need for a pet
If I throw this paper, your bitch gon’ fetch
Do it, B-i-g
And Detroit gonna be aight as long as we got me

[Verse 16: Trae The Truth]
I’m in the hood if you wonder where I’m at
In the back of a Chevy that’s all black
Racks on racks, I don’t know how to act
Track and field with the birds, I’m running em like track
Free throws of money, bet you can’t block
King of the club, I bet you can’t top
Bitch niggas hate the fact I get guap
Or the fact when the money go up, it won’t stop
I’m in the club, tryna show ‘em how to stunt
Tryna pick up what I’m throwing, it prolly take em bout a month
The club underwater, have em running out the front
While I’m somewhere in the back, getting blowed like a blunt
No need to trip, you can tell em that I’m cool as hell
‘Cause that’s the case I'm known to pack a tool as well
I’m a blood motherfucker, nothing new to tell
Got Vogues underneath the old-school as well
I got lights on my wrist that’ll flash like cop
Couple of foreign cars that I ride, no top
Couple of wet whips that I ride like yachts
A couple of haters looking, I’m knowing them niggas hot
And tell ‘em that I don’t give a damn
Hard as a motherfucker, tell em I was HAM
Call it what you want, I’ma do it for the fam
Yeah, that’s the type of nigga that I am

[Verse 17: Ace Hood]
Okay, I’m back off into this bitch
With a cup, and it’s full of that liq
Got racks, ain’t talking tits
Big stacks, no Lego bricks
Hit a trick and fiending nigga got it

Mow anybody wanna play some hockey

Blood, Sweat, and Tears, it’ll be on your local Walmart rack, soon

[Hook][Verse 1 - Lil Wayne]
A Millionaire
I'm a young money millionaire, tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease like a menstrual bleed
Through the pencil I leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
Cause I don't write shit cause I ain't got time
Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father, mother-fuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancing on the bridge, pussy popping
Tell the coppers hahahaha you can't catch em, you can't stop em
I go by them goon rules
If you can't beat em then you pop em
You can't man em then you mop em
You can't stand em then you drop em
You pop 'em cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher
Young Money

[Verse 2 - Cory Gunz]
I'm Millie in here with them Young Money millionaires
Think you really pop a wheelie in air?
Mac Milli, the Vanilli's in here, I'm a rascal, don't get whopped
I get brats who don't give top
I get tassel, pass you with a flow you could never put a brake on and I break on anything a nigga take on
Feel the napalm from my trey arm, straight long, throw a nigga like I'm Akon, cause I'm acorns
Where the base gone? get the base blown, let the Pistons on that chopper
Come on, cops, I'm kamikaze, drop a rock with them Obamas
Illie in the mind, really with the nine, millie when I rhyme, silly anytime fine, chilly, gitty on the grind
Shitty on a dime, Penny on the line plenty's in me, any guinea's with 'em, bigger than a mini, and remind I'm
Illie, and it's all off G piece and a PG walk by, beep beep
With a freak, skeet, hawk out, big feet on a jeep
She caught by Weezy F, we be the best, truly to death, prove me the rest
Groupies confess, you be the ref, 'xcuse me, I left

[Verse 3 - Lil Wayne]
A millionaire, I'm a young money millionaire
What, 'chyall really want it? Nah, y'all don't really wanna do it
If hip hop is dead, I am the embalming fluid
And I don't care who it be, I'm steppin' to it
Notice I say 'it', cause to me, it ain't shit
Get, it?
Call me whatcha like, trick, call me on my Sidekick
Never answer when it's private, man, I hate a shy chick
Don't you hate a shy chick? I had a plate of shy chick
And she ain't shy no mo', she changed her name to "My chick"
Yeah, boy, that's my girl
And she pops excellent up in Wayne's world
Totally dude, you should see their faces
When they see that this robot can move
And it's like... hahaha, yea
And it go... that's right

[Verse 4 - Lil Wayne]
A millionaire, I'm a
Young Money, Cash Money, fast money
Slow money, mo' money, never no money
What is that, who is that? I never heard of it
I will take your picture and make a 'Rest In Peace' shirt of it
Some should take this beat and make a 'Rest In Peace' shirt of it, cause
I killed it, now don't tell no one you heard of me
It's like the beat was screamin', "Murder me!"
And I'm a murderer, so I murdered it
And you niggas is what I eating I'll make sure of it
And he who don't believe me, I'll make dessert of him
Sherbet him, I mean, shame on him
Or her; Carter, father of
This rap thang, this is my race
Gon' take a lap, man, Weezy Baby's nursery
Now gon' take a nap man, it's naptime
I'll holla back at you at snacktime
Weezy F... yeah, OK

[Verse 5 - Lil Wayne]
They say I'm rappin' like B.I.G, Jay, and 2pac
André 3000, where is Erykah Badu at
Who dat, who dat said they gon' beat Lil' Wayne
My name ain't Bic, but I keep dat flame, man
Who dat one dat do dat boy? You knew dat, true dat, swallow
And I be the shit, now you got loose bowels
I don't O U like two vowels
But I would like for you to pay me by the hour
And I'd rather be pushing flowers
Than to be in the pen sharing showers
Tony told us this world was ours
And the Bible told us every girl was sour
Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower
Call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawn Mower
Boy I got so many bitches like I'm Mike Lowrey
Even Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me
Motherfucka I say life ain't shit without me
Chrome lips poking out the coupe, look like it's pouting
I do what I do and you do what you can do about it
Bitch, I can turn a crack rock into a mountain
Dare me
Don't you compare me cause there ain't nobody near me
They don't see me but they hear me
They don't feel me, but they fear me. I'm illi

Man, life just ain't life without me
Hip hop just ain't hip hop without me
Young Moola, baby[Hook: French Montana]
Light the motherfucking roof on fire
Know you see that coupe when we ride
(Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up)
I'm talkin' right now, right now
Shawty slide, I'm talkin' right now, right now
Light the motherfucking roof on fire
See that coupe when we ride

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Yea, ok the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn (Let it burn)
Yo friend took a molly, it's yo motherfucking turn (Yo turn)
And ya'll know all my money straight (It's straight)
Like a motherfucking perm (No perm)
And all I get is brain, and still ain't motherfucking learn
Hold up, nigga right now, turn the lights down
With a thick bad bitch and she light brown
And she gone make that ass clap, for a real nigga like right now
Oh, and I'm iced down, but that pussy so wet I might drown
With my swimwear, I jump in there, like splash

[Hook: French Montana]

[Verse 2: Cory Gunz]
Fuck hoes we don't love those
Nigga you don't live by the thug code
It's levels to this shit it's metals in this shit
And several niggas get introduced to the snub nose
Stomp niggas out till the club close, leave a nigga shirt filled with mud holes
All my flows they love those, we ain't the same set but you wearing blood clothes
I'm loaded now, fuck you talking 'bout?
I just left the judge I just met your bitch that mean it's going down

[Hook: French Montana]

[Verse 3: Mase]
Man what it look like, being a nigga got the lot of ya'll
Little snitch nigga like a fly on the wall
And I'm in a chick head like Tylenol
And I roll up in that black 'Bach, Matte black or that black Lac
And I put another hole in your snapback, step back, act bad
Who said something I ain't getting on nothing
Nigga picture that
Pop that nigga, stop that nigga
Drop that nigga, watch that nigga, rock that nigga
We get it back
When I turn up niggas wanna chill (Niggas wanna chill?)
I figured that
Murder back on that old ish
Point me back where the strippers at

[Hook: French Montana][Produced by Bangladesh]

[Hook]
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer
Swagger down pat, call my shit Patricia
Young Money militia and I am the commissioner
You no wan' start Weezy cause the 'F' is for finisher
So misunderstood, but what's a world without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time, synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin, what a fuckin' family picture
You know Father Time, and we all know Mother Nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buyin', I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds, fuck segregation
Fuck that shit, my money up, you niggas just Honey Nut
Young Money runnin' shit and you niggas just runner-ups
I don't feel I done enough, so I'mma keep on doin' this shit
Lil Tunechi or Young Tuna Fish

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I'm goin' back in
Okay, I lost my mind, it's somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you don't understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy
Just talked to Moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up, call it self-defense
Swear, man, I be seein' through these niggas like sequins
Niggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end
Talkin' to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, fuck the world, that's adultery
You full of shit, you close your mouth and let yo' ass talk
Young Money eatin', all you haters do is add salt
Stop playin', bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp, I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these motherfuckers talkin' crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall: outfielder
You know I'mma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playin', I do it like a king do
If these niggas animals, then I'mma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothin', you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money
Paper chasin', tell that paper, "Look, I'm right behind ya"
Bitch, real G's move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep so I can't find her
You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag you would kill for
Money too strong, pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishin' well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell

[Verse 3: Cory Gunz]
Word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean, get some Dramamine
Llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend
I played the side for you niggas that's tryna front, and see
Son of Gun, Son of Sam, you nigga's the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
Disturb me, and you'll be all over the flo' like Luda
Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bold like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be mackin', 'bout my stackin', now I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backin' out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler
Wayne, these niggas out they mind
I done told these fuck niggas so many times
That I keep these bucks steady on my mind
Tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause
To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love
Keep throwin' my sign in the middle
Hit 'em up, piece on my side, cause ain't no peace on my side, bitch
I'm a man, I visit urinals with pride
Tune told me to, I'm shootin' when the funeral outside
I'm uptown, thoroughbred, a BX nigga, ya heard? Gunna[Hook]
Uh, shut the fuck up and pay attention
Clowns loud, talk to much, I hope your listening

Clowns loud, talk to much, I hope your listening

[Verse]
Cory Gunz in this bitch like where the euros at
And Cory Gunz in this bitch like where the euros at
So fly, as the shit I get to give 'em that
Lead clap, knocking your whip, making your mirror crack
Pause
Don't it sound like I got my bearings back?
Sorry my younger audience, y'all if you're hearing that
Rap artists show me your heart, bitch if your wearing that
Be yourself, whatever, thought they'd let me, look who's here, I'm back
Weezy
Found all my problems sound, I'm hearin' that
'Case a fake nigga fazed, they come to me swearin' that
We should do a track but Mac Mizzle ain't clearin' that
And my Poppa Gat, and Shaq Dizzle ain't hearin that
Young
Money, I'm 'bout to pull a Pullitzer
Anybody here to show Gunz who to put the bullets on
Hot shit, dead at ya chest sucka, so suck it up

A Millionaire
I'm a young money millionaire, tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease like a menstrual bleed
Through the pencil I leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
Cause I don't write shit cause I ain't got time
Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father, mother-fuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancing on the bridge, pussy popping
Tell the coppers hahahaha you can't catch em, you can't stop em
I go by them goon rules
If you can't beat em then you pop em
You can't man em then you mop em
You can't stand em then you drop em
You pop 'em cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher
Young Money

[Verse 2 - Cory Gunz]
I'm Millie in here with them Young Money millionaires
Think you really pop a wheelie in air?
Mac Milli, the Vanilli's in here, I'm a rascal, don't get whopped
I get brats who don't give top
I get tassel, pass you with a flow you could never put a brake on and I break on anything a nigga take on
Feel the napalm from my trey arm, straight long, throw a nigga like I'm Akon, cause I'm acorns
Where the base gone? get the base blown, let the Pistons on that chopper
Come on, cops, I'm kamikaze, drop a rock with them Obamas
Illie in the mind, really with the nine, millie when I rhyme, silly anytime fine, chilly, gitty on the grind
Shitty on a dime, Penny on the line plenty's in me, any guinea's with 'em, bigger than a mini, and remind I'm
Illie, and it's all off G piece and a PG walk by, beep beep
With a freak, skeet, hawk out, big feet on a jeep
She caught by Weezy F, we be the best, truly to death, prove me the rest
Groupies confess, you be the ref, 'xcuse me, I left

[Verse 3 - Lil Wayne]
A millionaire, I'm a young money millionaire
What, 'chyall really want it? Nah, y'all don't really wanna do it
If hip hop is dead, I am the embalming fluid
And I don't care who it be, I'm steppin' to it
Notice I say 'it', cause to me, it ain't shit
Get, it?
Call me whatcha like, trick, call me on my Sidekick
Never answer when it's private, man, I hate a shy chick
Don't you hate a shy chick? I had a plate of shy chick
And she ain't shy no mo', she changed her name to "My chick"
Yeah, boy, that's my girl
And she pops excellent up in Wayne's world
Totally dude, you should see their faces
When they see that this robot can move
And it's like... hahaha, yea
And it go... that's right

[Verse 4 - Lil Wayne]
A millionaire, I'm a
Young Money, Cash Money, fast money
Slow money, mo' money, never no money
What is that, who is that? I never heard of it
I will take your picture and make a 'Rest In Peace' shirt of it
Some should take this beat and make a 'Rest In Peace' shirt of it, cause
I killed it, now don't tell no one you heard of me
It's like the beat was screamin', "Murder me!"
And I'm a murderer, so I murdered it
And you niggas is what I eating I'll make sure of it
And he who don't believe me, I'll make dessert of him
Sherbet him, I mean, shame on him
Or her; Carter, father of
This rap thang, this is my race
Gon' take a lap, man, Weezy Baby's nursery
Now gon' take a nap man, it's naptime
I'll holla back at you at snacktime
Weezy F... yeah, OK

[Verse 5 - Lil Wayne]
They say I'm rappin' like B.I.G, Jay, and 2pac
André 3000, where is Erykah Badu at
Who dat, who dat said they gon' beat Lil' Wayne
My name ain't Bic, but I keep dat flame, man
Who dat one dat do dat boy? You knew dat, true dat, swallow
And I be the shit, now you got loose bowels
I don't O U like two vowels
But I would like for you to pay me by the hour
And I'd rather be pushing flowers
Than to be in the pen sharing showers
Tony told us this world was ours
And the Bible told us every girl was sour
Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower
Call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawn Mower
Boy I got so many bitches like I'm Mike Lowrey
Even Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me
Motherfucka I say life ain't shit without me
Chrome lips poking out the coupe, look like it's pouting
I do what I do and you do what you can do about it
Bitch, I can turn a crack rock into a mountain
Dare me
Don't you compare me cause there ain't nobody near me
They don't see me but they hear me
They don't feel me, but they fear me. I'm illi

Man, life just ain't life without me
Hip hop just ain't hip hop without me

"We The Best Forever"

[Hook: Kevin Rudolf]
A million lights and a kick drum - the floor is moving slow
I've got a feeling bout this one - and we still young you know-oww-oww
I'm breathing fire in your club-ubb
It's not my fault if your heart's, grown, cold
It's not my fault if your heart's, grown, cold

[Tyga]
Uhh, new Hermes duffle bags
On the plane, see the sky through a little glass
Twenty hour flight never jet-lagged
Sipping white wine, watching the sunset
Real love this close I ain't never had
Sitting with you all day til the night pass
Damn, I ain't trying to fight that
But if we fall too fast will the feeling last
{*singing*} Now I'm looking over my shoulder, shoulder, uh
Champagne, good dimes and good times and now it's all over
{*rapping*} But you can't blame me for all that
You was bright now your heart all black
Try to outshine the good with the bad
You a cold motherfucker I ain't mad at you
Still shining

[Hook]

[Mack Maine]
Bitch I'm Mack Mai-I-I-I-I-I-I-ine...
You getting old and your heart turn cold
Time-line froze; mad at the world
Cause you lived your life but this the life that we chose
Lights on the road for the nicest Rolls
I mean long-ass flights for these trifling hoes
But we don't crap out when the dice is rolled
I mean no life, low life
Say my name and hopes to get more life, nigga live your life
Lame-ass nigga, you cook it with no spice
Lil B sacrifice, show me what your ho like
Hit her with that dope dick, now she's a dope fiend
Leo Lion the king, I'm looking for a dope queen
A First Lady baby, Young Money's Barack
Baggy cargos, high mismatched socks
Me, Gunz, Millz, Tyga, we give em the chills
Weak riders, get birth control pills

[Jae Millz]
(Millzy...) Uhh, bright lights
Lord knows I live for these nights
You're damn right
I'mma sip champagne till it blurs my sight
Yanks fitted cap to the front like Jeter
My diamonds ain't fierce like an episode of cheetahs Jesus
Loud jewelry, loud speakers
Blowing loud weed with some loud divas, Millz

[Hook]

[Cory Gunz]
(Young Money, Cash Money, We The Best, Khaled)
Uh, it's that summertime money time
Gonna rhyme good time, wanna dime, gimme mine
Loud smoke, quiet engine out the city line
Pretty toes hanging out the window to the finish line
Spikes poking out my kicks like a porcupine
Young Money, Cash Money, We The Best fall in line
Uptown thorough breded from the South Bronx
Hot blocks in Miami, Khaled outcome
You made us, they hate us, just to say the latest
Life nothing like a movie: I just day-to-day this
Remember it was hard trying to pay us wages
Nice spitting hard rhymes on the main stages
Independent, yeah I told em major later
We some independent niggas getting major paper
Shout Tune, Stunna, Slim, Mack
We play for keep, so how we gon' give up that
YMCMB, lights, camera, ACTION~!

[Verse 1: Lil Twist]
I put the kush in the stogie, yeah, I put the Bentley in Drive
I'm pulling out the garage, and thanking God I'm alive
I've been through so much shit, been through trouble and back
I ain't do much time, but dawg I ain't going back
These niggas fake and they phony, the paparazzi wait on me
I left the jail in Givenchy, they should have posted that homie
I'm in the A with Rich Homie, I'm in the A with 2 Chainz
I'm in the A with my brother, it's YMCM Rich Gang
Now tell them niggas line up, I tell them niggas time up
This KTZ gon' stand out, it's clear I don't give a fuck
In my closet I eat you up, my fashion ill - no duh
My whip game insane uh Ferrari Testarossa's
Y'all niggas thought I lost it, I'm awesome
I just took a break to teach a young nigga how to boss it
Like when KG went to Boston
Or when Melo went to the Knicks
And he brought JR Smith and they both started ballin'
Big bro went from serving birds to pelicans in New Orleans
Let me take a break, let me catch my breath
Rolling with the Birdman homie, it's YM over everything
Nigga, I don't need nothing else
It's Lil Twist, nigga, I'm checked in
I fucked homegirl and her best friend
You don't wanna miss out on your blessing
Got the dope dick and I use it as a weapon
I just

[Hook]
Shooter, BANG (x5)

[Verse 2: Euro]
Sometimes I think I'm Michael Jordan, Michael Tyson
Michael Phelps and Michael Jackson
Might just drop my fucking tape and fuck around, it might go platinum
How'd I do that off of freebies? Fill my double cup with ether
Got the same buzz as niggas with an album off of features
See I'm doing it again, got a tool in the timbs, now the rules gotta bend
No tools in the gym but I gotta bring it in
Because niggas wanna flex, but they really slim Jim
Gotta point it at him, him, fuck it and him
All I wanna do is kill kill for the ching ching
Got a best friend and the best friend got a twin
Gotta fit 'em all in, now that's a win win win win
The room's spinning cause I'm faded
Watch how you run up on these businessmen, they're gang related
I said I like the way she dance, she like the way I made it
Fuck me without paying the rent, imagine if I paid it
I owe you one girl, I owe you one's
Money always been the main attraction
Homie told me women always been the main distraction
And I'm too focused, I just hate to get disturbed
I'm busy making millions and she just started laughing
So you know I had to

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Cory Gunz]
When I'm mad is when I don’t even wana mask on
War paint like a baboon and my bitch got a red ass on
Young Money Cash Money to the dirt of me
So for certainly I'mma get my blast on
To the face of a fuck nigga trying to fuck with us
Think they can make it if they can run a decathlon
Stay blazing, I mack on, play brave and get back home
With them AK's, crack arms with a straight face, that calm
And I fain gaze and attack on with a straight razor in that palm
Any nigga want it he gotta get it
The Yappa got it rolling and rocking with it
I got a nigga showing and popping, picking and going
Packing a fight, everybody hit the floor, he shot the men and boom
Pall bearers, cold moms, militia all Bishop's, O-Dawg's
You should've drove off, hitting on bitches and poor dogs
Looking the nose off, looking like I'm flicking the stove off
When I'm kicking the stove off, kicking the doors off
Everybody hit the deck, still bodies get thrown off
Say making a remarkable pay
Meeting grandpa at a doc or a bay
Bad bitch, hide the grippers, I may
Fucking killing unbook, come the coppers and spray
Twizzie get the chicken, they plot him hopping the gate
If you get to trippin' then you get shot in the face
You ain't got the bitch in the kitchen popping the safe
Sorry to say, no eye witness, you finish you gotta bang

[Hook][Intro: Cory Gunz]
Militia don't play
Make a bitch bend down, obey
Walking about with that trey-eight and that yappa
Razor-blade in my hand, bitch, Baraka

[Verse 1: Cory Gunz]
Wasn't even a teenager, I think
Uncle Steve with those keys like Tom Hanks
Grandma said my bitch poisoning me
Butter-scotch in that twat, that pussy so sweet
I ain't stunting on one of these fuck niggas
Talking all mmm, why won't you go get it?
Pussy nigga, this activist got me activated
And the pussy nigga you acting like got me aggravated
When I was bored we played the game, I point 'em out
We fuck you up, trip you down and stomp you out
M-T-M, F-U-B, M-M-G
I'mma get icy and ball on niggas, M-S-G

You know how I do
Foreign bitch, smoking weed to my groove
Fat ass in my lap, hand on my strap
Fuck around, think I'm fuckin' around, you get clapped
What's the bad? I only fondle that bread
Naw, I don't know her name, but I know that head
Naw, I don't know that lame, you don't know that's fed?
Naw, you don't know my name, if so, your ass dead
Had a girl till she didn't answer her phone
She had a man till she came and then he wasn't home
O-G and codeine got me in my zone
When you talking to a G, watch your tone

[Hook: Cory Gunz]
Nigga, I'm walkin 'round with that trey-eight and that yappa

Get ready, get set, it's steady
Bloody spaghetti shredded, heavy debted, credit deadly
For bread, you'll get jelly-spreaded
The melody let me let it go mentally
Lindsay at it, coke headless with envy
At Nicole Richie and Brittany's habit
Cass, alot of rappers seem militant and be itching addicts
Putting nothing but wood on the shelve like a kitchen cabinet
So if I feel the static, I'll peel a 'matic
They'll get the static, the calico sporatic BLING!
Now it's not so radical!
We come to no compatible establishment, you broke nose
For tryna Mike Jones my O-Zone, be held embarassing
Shit, I'm geared as an afghani terrorist, I pop this tool
When I'm tryna bring you hell and mariest
You take a risk of reading braille for even dare stare at this
You don't live M.O.B., you nothing but a queer therapist
Nigga my M.O. be get that money even O.T., no penalty
Bueno si, that deniro b, that's all I see mentally
I shift you go from manual to automatic physically
Chemistry can't infiltrate my ministry, we in the street, you industry
Larceny, militia, nigga march with us
If not cass, put em on some whole nother charts from us
BODY BAGS

Signed to ruff ryders with a flow that was bonkers y'all
I can't even lie you can ask d.n.y
You can ask swizz too, s.p. and kiss too
You can ask dmx, the female pit to
And they all let you you know all the battles I had to get through
You can ask drag or sheek bout how I had to eat thousands of motherfuckers up yup I had the streets
But ain't no money in battlin an I had to eat
I can spit wreckless but I had to make a hit record
An now I make hit record after hit record

The innocent man, been in the can
But I never made a statement never been on the stand and I'm independent now, but that been in the plans
Cause it's all about the benjamins man, real talk
And you dudes can't walk in my timberlands man
And my sneaks don't fit you
The streets don't fuck with you
I sip champagne and I throw back shots
And I smoke pot the color of a apple jacks box
I rap but I sold crack rock
And had the block jumpin like the frog on the honey smacks box
You dig em?
Body bags!Yeah I love money I love hoes
I cuff money I never cuff hoes
Middle finger to you hatin ass niggas
Y'all should retire Gary Payton ass niggas
Steady worrying about the hoes I put my balls in
Cause it might be a bitch you callin darling
And it hurts that you might see me live at the Garden
And I'm on the floor while Melo on the floor and just like I'm a balling
And I talk expensive so I drop 20 bands on my whip
Money ain't a thing it never been a thing
So I wipe my ass with hundred dollars bills
Told y'all niggas I'm the hottest in the hood
Got it by the O and I got it for the good
Niggas better know when they come to my town
That it comes to see me when it comes to my hood
Doin my thing they can't ruin my thing
Tip toe down they ain't moving my thing
Pussy get close then im shooting my thing
Give a man soft, sucka might sing
Back em all down sit em all up
Tell the paramedics come pick em all up
If a nigga move then we hit them all up
If they ever need work tell them niggas call us
Shake down, shake down
For that money leave a fucker face down
Yeah

Why am I violent
Siolent in my moment

If they don't pay respects, why I send you a condolence
In case you didn't notice
Nigga this is my time
Front and get your back ache
Tryna run on my nine
Put the bread on your head

The South Side, the South Side, these bitches' mouth wide
Can't trust a pig, informant nigga, run the cop wired
They set us up, then book me up, you crooked fuck
Get to the jail, tell them bitches to look me up
I'm on top of my shit, Red Bottoms like how my shoe tastes
Standin' from where I'm at, the licro is my shoe lace
I chunk a deuce, pour a four all inside an eight ounce
I'm faded now, finna cut a ho off like K Camp
TMZ on my dick, they swear they can knock me off, shit
Harvey better chill 'fore niggas run in his office
Write our own article, tell the people who caused it
Faggot tried to hide, first spot we shot is the closet
Crazy mothafucka, Mossberg in the moshpit
Ever since I hit LA, I'm wildin' on my Pac shit
B.I.G., "Who Shot" shit, or Jay on his Roc shit
"Wop Wop," "Drop It Like It's Hot," "Block Is Hot" shit

Fat Fly Nigga, landing on your runway
Got the work coming, I'm the black Mickey Monday
Snowflake fresher than the morning on a Sunday
I ain't a killer but my homie with the gun play

Damn, crazy right? We the typa kids live a crazy life
We get money, fuck bitches, rock crazy ice
And it's Young Money Records, ho, I'm really with D'wayne
In the club drunk trippin' yelling "Bitch, I'm Mack Maine!"
Boy's insane, top down in the rain
Holding up traffic, shootin' dice in your lane
Niggas shot me in my back, but I'm back bro
No we not a Jack boy, we done jacked bro
Started sellin' crack, now a nigga sellin' crack flows
Meet me in the trap, I'll be right by the back door
You can get a Bow Wow, you can get a Fat Joe
You can get finessed, I'm from Dallas, boy, it's natural
You can get it all for a real pretty penny
Niggas in the hood cookin' chickens, eatin' Denny's

Compare me to them, I'm 100, I'm not like them

Rick Ross video in that off-white Beamer
I'm at the bar taking shots of nightmares with dreamers
Shoot for the stars, hope the moon ain't [?]
Stepped in the game and I spit that ether
And I ain't leaving 'til I blow, funny, these hoes ain't either
Listen, it's February, leaves enough time for me
So by December, I should be a millionaire at least
The least, take my word, this the year I beast
And if not, y'all can kill me by New Years Eve, please

[Verse 4: Flow]
Rollin' blunts while I'm listening to my Jigga disc
Smokin', flickin' ashes from the tip of the pyramid
Dressed in black growing up, horns for my membership
White kid listened to my song then he slit his wrist
I have a nightmare to stop you niggas from dreaming
I never read the bible, but I watch angel and demons
The devil after me? Well fuck it, I'm anxious to meet him
But shhh, shhh, just keep it secret
If I join this force would people stop hatin'?
Should I rap like this to join a Roc Nation
Flow cold like I'm rapping while I'm ice skating
Somebody get me an apron, all of my time wasting
I keep it dirty like Chucks, plus I'm a little Gothic
I spit curses and spells and black nail polish
I fuck gypsies and witches, all of my pals' monsters
Smarter than 12 doctors, sharper than nail filers
Call Satan like fuck it, show me how hell look
I take a nun, then I fuck her like a werewolf
I have no heart, no soul, only these spell books
You niggas' bitches and hoes minus the girl looks
I paint pictures with lyrics so y'all can see my thoughts
Now follow me, in my evil voice
Tweet, Young mother fuckin' Money
These my mother fuckin' brothers, not my fuckin' hubbies

[Verse 5: Cory Gunz]
Militia nigga, you know the name
Cory Gunz, remember my pops era, the son of Dame
The fuck is he supposed to call it
The closer the call is, the closer you going
I'm claustrophobic, your swagger is (?)
Mine is poison, I cough a lotus
Walk New York and show this off
Awesome assault aerobics
You could 80 billion chinups, billion dips and a zillion situps
I stomp you where you at, til' you (?) what it was
Keep me from creeping down the strip bored
Hit for it, jigsaw, clip board
Then I rip your bungees at the zip cord
Pardon my lip lord, can I get my (?)
(?)
Goons smoking (?), lining it raw
Who want it with us
Let me know if its beef nigga
I hope you got the coco leaf or clover leaf
Ain't no competing with these
Niggas from boogie to bang bang boogie
Ain't gangbang for chains, stings, cookies and brains hang
Anythang
Anybody looking to bring pain, maintain
Anybody looking to say name, stay sane
Anybody looking to play games
Ain't wild or worthwhile
Nigga just stay tame

[Verse 6: Gudda Gudda]

[Verse 7: Lil Wayne]
Smoke, sex, skate, shoot
Boy we turnt up like breakin' news
Let the kids live, baby, dude
Blood all in the fuckin' baby food
The cradle too, shoot the dog once
Turn around, tell the kids, "Stay in school"
Leave out the house, neighbors peekin' out the windows
Show the pistol to the neighbors and the neighbors move
I don't give a fuck about a nigga's caregiver
I be with them niggas that'll fuck their stepsister
I be with them niggas that'll kill your caregiver
I'll do Brazilian wax on a hair trigger
Lord I think I need a hitman
Tell Biggie I'm a big fan
My pockets on Biggie Smalls
Your pockets on stickman
I just came from the gun store
I spent about 10 grand
Now the parents wearin' black clothes
And got your homies wearin' shit bags
Think I need a hitman
'Bout to go kidnap a rich man
If he don't give it up we chop him up
And send his body parts to his house gift wrapped
I think I need a hitman
I can't trust the next man
Thank Lord for my weedman
But right now we're playin' phone tag
I'm doin' 40 down the boulevard
I told my homie he gon' take the charge
He got the Tommy and I got the MAC
And on your head they got a contract
I thank you for my hitman
And tell Pac I'm a big fan
I sang "Dear Mama" to my dear mama
And sang "Hit Em Up" to my daddy's bitch ass
I thank you for my hitman
'Bout to go kidnap the big man
As you can see I got big plans
Big plans to be the big man
40 down the boulevard
With my homies, they gon' take the charge
Say, "It's nothin', boy I got your back"
Because them other niggas copy cats
I thank you for my hitman
This for all my fans that been fans
I'm so sorry, I'm so fuckin' sorry
I'm so sorry for the weight like Slim-Fast
Stick MDMA up a bitch ass
AT&T, ass, tongue and tit man
Oh, oh shit, man
Your pockets on stickman

[Verse 8: Lil Wayne]
It talk like a killer, it walk like a killer
It must be a killer, I must be a killer
Hustlin' Priscilla straight out of the villa
I got more customers shoppin' at Dillards
Don't fuck with these niggas, I don't know their names
Fuck these niggas, I don't give a damn
Fuckin' with Wayne, Talkin' to Wayne
You talkin' to Wayne is like talkin' to flame
22 pop for a brick in the drought
You can't buy the chicken then please chicken out
Or if you snitchin' we will sniff it out
You'll get found at your house, put your dick in your mouth
Dope, skinny ass sweats
Got a strap wear that bitch on my back
I walk in the mall with that shit on my back
With my bitch hollerin' 'bout, "I want this, I want that"
Ooh, mulah
Like la, la, la, la, la, la Too much Cubana up in me cabana
Too much white china and Columbiana
That Columbiana, Zoë Saldaña
Fuck, hollup
I'll be right back, keep the lights on, baby
Leave the lights on, baby
Them niggas play, they'll get wiped off, baby
Like Lysol, baby
I pull up on a bitch wearin' one .38
Put a bitch nigga on First 48
Fuck a bad bitch in the first 24
She take off all her clothes, say she sorry for the wait
Put her legs on a nigga like a hula hoop
I go between her legs like we shootin' hoops
I break a chicken down to some noodle soup
I buy a Rolls Royce like a Subaru
I buy a Rolls Royce like a Subaru, bitch

[Verse 9: Lil Wayne]
Wait bitch, I've been on
Top of my shit, I've been thinkin' 'bout shit
All this lean in my punch got me lickin' a mothafuckin' fist
Lord please don't let my ice melt
Muhfuck these dog hoes
But this 9 on my right leg
Times get hard, nigga I could sell crack to a white egg
Sell wrong to a right end
Nigga it's Carter time and niggas horrified
It's glorified in this bitch
Prioritized and immortalized
I'm on the borderline and it's thin
Hold up I'm lightheaded like a kite, baby
I might, maybe, get life, baby
My light shady, my rice, gravy
My nights daily, my life's crazy
Lil Tunechi, bitch[Hook x2]

My cologne is a merge of The Kush n The Herb
Break It Down Grind It Crush It Roll It If It's Potent
Takin Tokes Takin Notes Ho A Mutha Fuckin Smokin

[Hook x2][Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
This is not to be rewarded
Killin' beats that wasn't mine when all my vocals was distorted
See King Dizzy's no different than King James
Cause I live to learn, the world don't want another Michael Jordan
Look, even though I got a jumper like Larry Bird
With all these white girls screaming for me singing every fucking word (word)
I can tell that you the homeboy that ain't never riot
Me? Oh I just make fashion statements almost every night
I'm taking flights without no seatbelt on and landing
Headed to the top and I'm leaving all of these fuck niggas stranded
Nothing handed, we with that learning money management movement
Save it just to spend it, do a show and then I recoup it
Young boss man, fuck an off brand
Me? I'm fuckin' on this bad bitch with a big booty and soft hands
That wanna be my wifey when I'm off cam
But when I'm on cam, she already know the program, I'm pro-gram
So I roll up more grams to slow jams so we can vibe out
We the Cadillac boys, she hop inside so we can ride out
She turn the music up and twist the weed
A real nigga baby, this trip's on me

[Verse 2: Derek Luh]
It's crazy how the trouble kid excel right past 'em
Mashing it's a habit, like fuck it, I gotta have it
She bad, then I gotta bag it, touching her like a tablet
My whole camp moving forward, you just living in the past tense
Shit, I'm tired of these has-beens
I think it's time to cash in
Get your weight up, motherfuck a hater
Homie in it for the paper, get to stepping like Omega
Weight up, wake up, grind 'til the day up
Straight up, say what, it's easy as a layup bahhh
We do it 'til they pissed off
Hustlin' like Rick Ross, dick stained with lip gloss
D-Luh

[Verse 3: Mark Battles]
(Battles! It's Fly America!)
Look, want the money and respect, you can keep the power
Plan to grab the whole world, it may take a hour
Bad hoes in bath robes when I take a shower
Pussy sweet as presidential, call it Eisenhower
My momma wit it, that honest living I gotta get it
The finest women, I try commitment, then I forget it
She riding in it but still in awe that I'm 'bout to hit it
We got a witness, I'm spitting raw with no contradiction
Whoa, they hating on the daily
Used to freestyle for free but now you gotta pay me
Career going 80 and it's starting to drive 'em crazy
Fly America, I'm a patriot, call me Tom Brady
Take it all and leave the rest with 'em
I'm done with the chatter, wanna be the next victim
Call Doctor Khaled, got the we the best syndrome
Undefeated, never lost like a GPS system
Get 'em, I bet you hate that we winning
Keep giving your opinion, it ain't making a difference
If you can't take the heat, then stay away from the kitchen
Your album name is lemonade, could be made in a minute
Get it? Minute Maid, I'm a renegade
They been afraid, I tend to blaze when I'm center stage
Pitching game on my Clemen stain with a different name
Pad all the walls, it's 'bout to get insane, flame
You could tie me in a straitjacket
Proclaimed the nicest in my age bracket
I'm really being modest cause I hate bragging
Study who I am, cram like my name backwards
Ha, it's too much for y'all
Hating on a nigga, so Ku Klux and all
The pain temporary dog, I grew up to ball
Think I'm visually impaired, I don't see them at all
It's Battles

[Verse 4: Euroz]
(Yeah, you know you can't forget the Z)
They throwing salt in the game, nigga Skip Bayless
On that totem pole shit, stacking big faces
Long list of (?) from the wrist, take it
Fly with his (?), it's why the chicks chasing
Naked if she with me, thought you knew this
I've always had a thing for a nudist
Riding on the strip, it's only right I play my new diss
Every time I hear a nigga's song it's like this in a new diss
Tell me what I don't know
Who needs a budget when the haters handle promo
Before they claim King Basquiat was the logo
I stitch crack in every line, the shit's so dope
Never been the type to talk, we a Comcast
Looking all directions possible, the compass
Jean piece 'em when the bullshit don't come pass
(...?), swear this money tend to come fast
No dubstep but I get you beta for cheap
The bed I land was made up by me
My ex is PI, check all the latest to me
Only time she touch the star, she favorite the tweet
I'm the dude like I was robbed - take it from me
I couldn't tell you 'bout the time she was taken from me
Read my pea sized proof and just take it from me
The larger picture, most niggas need patience to see it
(Don't forget the Z...)

[Verse 5: Chris Webby]
On that cypher rap shit, I’m still the awkwardest guy
Then drop flows and serve cats with an order of fries
When my album’s in your whip, make sure the volume is high
‘Cause shit is fresh, they been calling me the Lord of the Fly
I’m part samurai, part Spartan
Part ninja with a pirate’s attitude, proceed with caution
You wish you kept it moving after you step into warriors
Who butt heads like pachycephalosauruses
You won’t be standing when the fucking dust settles dude
So now y’all know exactly what the fuck my pen’ll do
I’m close, I can feel it in my gut, call it seppuku
But ain’t no swords involved with all the shit I’m ‘bout to execute
So play it cool like ehhhh, yo his shit’s straight
Like I ain’t what you bumping at the gym while you lift weights
I let these kids hate, then ask 'em how my dick tastes
And write a whole mixtape on one fucking sync break
Bitch, name a kid who could rap that dope
Since high school, I held the pad and the backpack close
While them one hit wonders, they could stack that dough
They’ll be in gone in 24 like a Snapchat post
I’m a ghost motherfucker, shit I need me a tan
A strong drink and a model on a beach in the sand
But that’ll come when I accomplish all the dreams that I’ve planned
And get more radio activity than seas in Japan
Every station in rotation, they’ll be playing my shit
Until then, I’ll be anywhere they pay me to spit
You ain’t got shit on what I’m gonna do
So pump the brakes like a school bus and stop it right in front of you, bitch

[Verse 6: Emilio Rojas]
Emilio, my name is synonymous with the truth
Like Chris Brown name is synonymous with abuse
(Fuck the system!)
It’s like it’s anonymous in this booth
I be riding uptown with some mamis that’s in the coupe
And we don’t like nobody except the clique that we rolling with
You ain’t on the dick, I expected you to go and hold the shit
Buzz a little bit, I ain’t have a label promoting it
I never had a fucking co-sign, I been alone in this
My heart’s cold, my ribs are refrigeration
My lungs are like ventilation, don’t fuck with this Venezuelan
(Just the tip!)
Now y’all will get fucked with no penetration
I be rocking All Saints, they cuts have been venerated
Ah, our generation is drug addicted and lost
But I ain’t judging nothing man, Jesus carried the cross
And Mari bust it open, them Virgin Marys are gone
If Jesus was a carpenter, license seen, he has a saw
Street code of ethics, the code of silence
And I seen a fiend so co-dependent on dope we buying
They took his ass to court as a co-defendant on trial
And they lock him up for what they should treat him for ‘cause they wylin’
Shit ain’t never change, it ain’t gonna
They should make my people legal before they do the marijuana
Instead INS will be rushing us to the border
‘Cause you can’t tax a person for wanting more for they daughter
(It's E to the M-I, L-I, O, I'm saying)

[Verse 7: Cory Gunz]
Whoever want it can get it, word to you and yours
I don't buy convertibles, you know they shoot in doors
I ain't to be slept on, but niggas asleep
Like the king to be crept on, so niggas'll creep
Stay in your lane or get swept on, cause niggas is sweet
Yeah he came with his weapon, for niggas to weep
Try and name what they rep on, the niggas'll reap
Anything getting stepped on, my niggas'll leak
Shouldn't have played, playing for keeps
Bullshit all ya'll talk came with receipts
I aim, squeeze, bang and repeat
Stain in the streets
Think before you rap before they clap the brain out ya peeps
Skullcandy soldier, (...?)
(...?) full of shells like the Zi in Zeeti
Let the Macaroni fly, satisfied when you bring me half of only I
Then you laugh and throw me fire
Pause this rap shit, been ahead of my time
Ahead of my grind, no pawn keep a head to my nine
Nothing in my mind made up, I made up my mind
That's if a nigga play us, I'm facing my time
Want the crib (...) can find
Hardly got living room space, haters lamp shading my shine
From the cradle to the grave of my grind
Filet a nigga from the navel to the waves of my nine
My influences are cable and crime
Making bagel designs and being a fucking tornado with rhyme
My influences are cable and crime
Making bagel designs and being a fucking tornado with rhyme
I'm doneFu fu fu fu find me in the nice spot
Watch me get this b*tch jumping like hopscotch
Bow is the name but dont get it twisted
Always wear a rubber when im in these dirty b**ches
They better stop playing with me, They better stop it doe
Rooms full of cash, would think I sold a lot of doe (Stuntin)
Ka-keep hoes like a pint do, killing every stadium and every F**king Venue
I run this sh*t, hit these other rappers up like Funyun Chips
Big Dog no kibbles and bits
And when I say I ball, I ain't talking about dribbling b*tch
Park my Yacht next to diddy boat
I put on for my city yo, if you ain't planning on making it rain
Then why the fuck you in here foe?
Smoke erb until my lungs collapse
Im just a young nigga with big stacks
They Call me Whizzle B*tch

[Hook]
Standing on the couches like we run this bitch im with a bad lambrod and ima kick the bitch out if she act stuck up if
You think we can't do it then yo life fucked up - ?

[Cory Gunz]
Whizzle and gunna got em bro red tails my nigga gets fly and let em go
Young money if they never know they better know I set and go we never fold

For the fed they going federal so fled the folds
The sevenal leave several with severed souls
Beyond pain on my job state im my moms blamer

Get a grip here, nigga, take a trip there, nigga
Straight trip there, nigga, F N 57 N 447, 4544, 357 more weapons

Black diamonds on my ear, black diamonds on my wrist
Black diamonds on my neck that's why I'm in your bitch

[Hook: Birdman]
Hustle in the morning, smokin' in the clouds
Bitches come in dumpin' cause they ran a hundred miles
Rain still pourin', the bottles lift up
Stuntin' on them bitches and the whips flamed up
The sun do shine, Christmas every day
Them holidays comin', so you know we quit the spray
Muscle is a must, the money in the can
Strapped every day, we still hustle in the sand

[Verse 1: Cory Gunz]
Uh, holla holla
Hehe, go
I'm a need a mountain of money
A mountain that amount the amounts to a mountain of money
Ride out with my dunny, fresh up out your mommy
Shout to the tummy - eat, sleep, shit on my toes
Bust a bitch in her nose cause they mouth so runny
Back to the money, Dada
Give a nigga bread like "bless you" (thank you) nada
I'm been on the block from the top tryna plot on a spot
Now I'm game with it - ta da!
Fuck around, I'll bang with the sawed-off
Fuck around, rob these niggas, do my thing like "voila"
Ain't nothin' changed but the dollars
Niggas so lame cause they ain't gon' claim i'm they father
Fuck it
I'm one of the niggas that don't fold
Treat me like one of them niggas that don't rap
Spinning 'em like a Tommy, automatic my laddy
I've been known to get niggas in one "blap!"
When I trip up, it's foreign - when I grip up, it's foreign
When I fuck, bitch foreign
Pull on my Trukfit foregin...
Pull on my Trukfit foregin...
I don't trust these hoes

[Hook: Birdman]

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Every single morning that a nigga get out of bed
Know a nigga gotta get it
Money to burn, raw OG Kush in a $100 bill, smoke weed with it
Why y'all niggas wanna whip shit with it?
Mulssane, I ain't gotta put a key in it
True don, make me wanna whip in it
Different money - add another didget
Get this money then I slide and I'm gone
Y'all already know who's side that I'm on
YMCMB, lil' nigga - Rich Gang, everything far from the norm
From the jails to the college campus, we've got 'em yellin' in the dorms
We try to compete 'til they go bankrupt, and we're just gettin' warm
If you ain't know, motherfucker, you can take another look, nigga
Whole team strong...
And we knock every spot on the charts
Every time a nigga drop each song
I don't need to tell 'em, they already know what it is
We run every city and we runnin' every block, nigga
Respect this conglomerate, bitch, cause you can't reach the number one spot

[Hook: Birdman]

[Verse 3: Mystikal]
Yup, i quit that bitch, don't look at my bucks

Automatic guns oi and get a case off

I spot em out on a map and move they place off
You turn him like a chuck t with the lace off
I leave a nigga taste off when I pace off
I let it waste off fist gun I'm laid off
I'm violent as 50 Cent leave em like Mase off
Landing all ties like a race draw
Put a nigga in his place like a race lost
Treat bitch made niggas like state law
Catch you bootleggers on fake flaws I break jaws
Like elephantitis and get to talkin like meningitis
And knowin my vitals and sypholitis for thin
Apparatus shit shatters and scatters against the lord
The writers homie tigh as is tragic and sad as a fucking thought to write it, what
Handled with a Uzi shottie
Shit it make range I make her why toosie drop
Tell your boys avoid Lloyd like a paranoid droid
A shortsten Roy Floyd you won't enjoy joy

Talk of new york tear a nigga face off
Yea shoot a nigga face off

I'm a die a boss when them shots fired off
Broad day 4 k's have your face sliding off
Ductape fuck face take the wires off
Get your slut rape cut cake now your wifes a whore
I'm the type of guy you probly wouldn't like at all
Lift the German ruger don't work then I'm a knife it off
Leave the blade bloody I don't got to wipe it off
Broke ya body till it go limp with no life at all
The k clap asap I don't play that
Got guns in the crib older than the a-trak
Dust em off go outside then spray black
Ak listen you will never get your face back

[Hook x2][Hook:]
Ridin' round smoking weed with my foreign bitch
Ridin' round smoking weed with my foreign bitch, foreign bitch
My window down on ridin' to my new shit
Got my new bitch, got my got my new bitch
I don’t camp out for no J's they sell them hoes for free
Never payin' for no pussy fuck them hoes for free
Badd bitches on deck

You know how the fuck I do
Puffing bud with my boo, cups of mo with my crew
8 O's of that syrup straight rolling that purp
Fat ass in my lap, sheep pole in my shirt
Hammers all in my belt, grey brim on my scalp
High is all the things up, showing off for myself
Red nikes to my mics, Vans Chucks on my spikes
Low riding yo chick, right behind my bike
Barney piss in my sprite, Christmas grinch in my swish
Ballin on em all night, me and my bitch
Call them hoes some more miley, call them hoes some more drink
Sixty racks in my pocket, all them hoes is gone think
Neck and wrist a bit nippy drinkin I’ma get tipsy
Sipping on me get trippy trippin' I'mma get grippy
Make the chopper get choppy, different I just get cocky
No lippin' ma don't kiss papi, slipping I just get sloppy
Haters ain't in my set, why they all in my mix
Y’all can all get next on my dick bitch

[Hook:]

Yep when it’s time for guns to get lifted
It’s time for guns to get lifted
Oh it’s time for guns to get lifted
Border brick for my kicks, border brick for my click
Couple drums for my six, one for my bitch
They ain’t searching no woman I just..that two pocks
Ping pong in that chronic, feel like hologram 2Pac
Gangsta party bust the bitch open
I don’t care what you’re rolling as long as I smoke it
They dont love to see money but I show it
Memory of keep money mental fold of my moment
Marked for death I’m tatted watch yourself ’cause I’m bout it
Kick the fuck out your bitch ass paying won’t be bout it
I ain’t tryin to get violent I'm just tryin to get wasted
Only time I’m smiling is when I get faced it
Take the time taste it, David buyin'..basin
Book bag of that lab I get high as my neighbours
Take the time taste it, base it
Take the time taste it, David buyin..basin
Put the bag in that lab I get high as my greatest

[Hook:][Hook x2: Prodgy & Cory Gunz]
Rapping is my religion
Brings me the finest women
Gives me them eight figures
Cause we some Great Spitters [Prodigy]

Respect that M O B B
D Double E P
Real rap, real shit, real spit
Niggas pray when they see me [Cory Gunz]

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
It's that real conversation, my mu'fuckin' occupation
Hitman I body that with a contiac, with a track, I slay it
With a little bit of grass, little bit of class
Little bit of brashness I mix it up, till it's just enough
To have me on that best rap list
It's that empire state shit, where we love the entire nation
Niggas that want to stunt on us, they deserve to die, don't try my patience
Paint prov, like a bass kick, thank God, I erase this, big boy to head boy
Take that as a fuckin' favor
I know, I know, I know, you niggas think P be poppin' shit
And probably don't know that everything P be poppin' is
Louder than words, my niggas ain't clowns, we not herds
I bounce yo head off that curb, I'm just a rhymin' expert
What you niggas want me to be, your Grim Reaper see?
I can see through you snake ass eyes
And you know misery loves company, and they hate when they see me shine
See these dimes, see this cash, see me on tour with the infamous
I'll see you in hell, my gun ring bells, puts all that bullshit to rest

[Hook x2: Prodgy & Cory Gunz]

[Verse 2: Cory Gunz]
I've got niggas on lock, doin' time
Cleanin' Mac's, right off the block, movin' dimes
Who wanna ride, where to?
Chicks told me I'd be there in a year or two
Goin' at the mall, corners appear poof
Death is just around the corner, it's here too
Got a little brother, I'mma give a better life
Beautiful little girl's I'mma put to bed at night
I was 12 in the kitchen, when they let in white
R.I.P. my nigga Beretta Mike
I'm affiliated with the renegades
I don't got juice, pop you, now I'm Minute Maid
In the bucks we trust, when they lust me
I'll be givin' a fuck to dust into disgust we bust
My mother, she was too young, she would've kept me
Still wouldn't be able to run, bad-ass loud tell a nigga to hum
Dessert too hot nigga eat wit ya tongue
Unless you're Mobb Deep I ain't sayin' little, I'm done
Like Charlie, see me have a gun
Tell an old girl, party with a nigga til' one
She got a body, harder to beat on a gun

I got keys to the spot with a G and a Pump
D's on the block just screamin' to jump
P tell 'em stop 'fore I be in the front
When niggas get caught, catch me if you want (x2)

[Hook x2: Prodgy & Cory Gunz][Verse 1]

Young money militia with it
Cash Money business, we missed the hit then your bitch'll get it
Full grown, heart colder than South Fargo
Load the pockets in my cargos for what your car goes
Fuck it I can't complain, die I don't like him anyway
Took for Wayne, Mack, and Stunna to snatch him anyway
Shorty from the DVD, y'all ain't catch him anyway
Thinking look at these bird brains, I'll hatch 'em any day
Take it in acid, I'll put a bird on your bitches
Like, fuck a fashion statement, I state the fashion
Like, I'm straight smashing with an irate passion
Shit, like I hate crashing, rip like I'm late passing
I'm loyal to fam like oil to Sam
I know niggas boiling grams for foil and Spam
I'm on a track like Lebron, not annoying his man
Before the games, clap chalk and ya boy at the lane
Who game?

[Hook]
Real niggas saying they hardbody
Be the same niggas talking around
Real niggas saying they hardbody
Be the same niggas stuck in the ground
Real niggas saying they hardbody
Be the same niggas jumping the gun
Real niggas saying they hardbody
Be the same niggas pumping a lung

[Verse 2]
I'm the definition of staying humble
And the militia's the definition of staying mumble
Admitting you ain't in correct position to say & mumble
All you getting is disrespect cause you wouldn't lay a fumble
I'm the tiniest of them out of the fucking jungle
But I'm quiet enough to show 'em I want the trouble
Never had a shot off the backboard
I know niggas from detention that'll turn your block to a blackboard
Cory Gunz hot as a crack store
That's probably why I always got a thirsty ass broad on my black straw
Before I wanted the nigga to treat right, now I'm considering the Quran pawn
I do the beats right
Respect or the Tek's going off like a street bike
And you gon' see his neck blowing off like a street light
Pause, creep tight sneaking beneath night
Or be the next hellbound nigga to seek Christ, aight

[Repeat hook]

[Verse 3]

I don't know where they found fam
Fuck around with me, I'll make your self-esteem low as the Soundscan
Rep the city like I'm the town man
Try work it out or else you're getting stuck, wait the pound's jammed
You rap like opposite what you act like
You act like you wouldn't scratch strike in a cat fight
You scrap like you wouldn't clap right in a strap fight
Motherfuckers know how I rock, that's what I rap like
Nigga real mean, I gotta trill team
First nigga, baby grey Glock with a teal beam
Something heavy, try to make a nigga wheels lean
Quiet, the silencer make you sound like a seal stream
You can chase the cookie trick, I want the real cream
Nigga I'm trying to peel green like a sealed screen
How this feel? Looking like a shotta kill scene
Cuz my whole crew shoot the nigga, we a film team

[Repeat hook]It’s Gunz. Shout to my BK niggas
Shmurda what up nigga? Let’s get it
Cory, he some hot nigga
They caught me with the Taurus not the Glock nigga
Yall niggas too loud feds watch niggas
Find me with me blazers bussin shots nigga
Ain’t nothin open for you but the shop nigga
We get jiggy bussin jugs bussin chops nigga
Got some niggas doin life doing shop nigga
They be shooting at the cops nigga
Free Teezy ho, free my nigga Scat, Free fleezy yo
You know we countin up when yall back out
And if she on da flow Imma go in dat mouuuuuth
You stupid if you think you got me slippin boy
Ask about me I be grippin boy!
Scorin Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen boy
You could keep the ho, I’m bout this chicken boy!
AK47 at your squadron. You be quick to give me to the sergeant
I do the shmoney dance and I dodge itttttt
Then I pistol-whip you like the chargers
I feel like a hundred thousand million. A project of the section 8 I’m really in
Put on the plate, you chow now. Fresh out the box, take a towel blow down, POW!
No pause either cuz he strapped now. Breeze movin P’s out the trap now
I told my nigga Charlie “yo I’mma turn it up”. Don’t need a hunnit niggas just a couple real as us
Bitch. I’m a thug nigga. Razors blades, with those in the club nigga
If it ain’t a pistol, it’s a snub nigga. Whoever got a issue it’s a dub nigga
Drinked out and I’m ridin out wit yo bitch
Walking my hater straight to that frank stand
They don’t gotta bump, my shit talkin cause that strap to go break dance. Like a bad deal, I’m rip off em. Bitch stop it put yo face on yo bitch chest like it’s a locket
Got an extra shell in my fifth pocket for the seventh nigga that shit poppin
Young Money that shit poppin, yo shit droppin, yo shit floppin
No bullshit. I don’t talk feelings; with kindness I make soft killings
That last single I was on really sold 3.5, 4 milli. Like take that pop bang, no payback don’t play with me. Google me, I’m hot nigga, that 9 milla stay with me
So dead that, ass back. You’ll die if I don’t get that bread back, too tired for that bed nap, well I’m getting high as that head crack
These niggas ain’t got no style, running round on my old swag
That’s so bad, y’all throw this shit like y’all run around with my whole bag. Got one thing clear bout Gunna, hear a fucking thing bout Gunna. (I air nut sling mouth runnin like shots into they outcomers nigga!)
