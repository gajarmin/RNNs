[TALKING]
I do this for ya'll man
Malice, Nickelus F, it's the REMIX!

[VERSE 1: Malice]
Lights slow motion, steppin' out the Phantom
All eyes on me, peekin' and glancin'
Leanin' on the wall, with b-boys dancin'
Ears, neck, and wrists lookin' like the king's ransom
One chick, each arm, makin' it a tandem
Flat here costing' like fifty grand standard
Bottles poppin', cars wit' options
We livin' like kings, homie, you just watchin'
And I'm a show for ya, marble flo' for ya
And that thing in the driveway, came with the spoiler
I ain't bluffin', cop jewels off the Russian
Diamonds in the Jesus, look like he's blushin'
Miami breezes, we cross seasons
Escaped indictments, thank you Jesus
Y'all haters ain't even got a clue
While we get this paper, and that's how we do

[BACKGROUND]
R-E U-P G-A-N-G
R-E U-P G-A-N-G

[Hook](x2)
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

[VERSE 2]
Check, the verses I'm writing you might wanna learn it
You hatin my song but your wife wanna burn it
So now you at the store for some blank CDs
You can't see me, for your sake might wanna return it
Cause, if you bring them discs home to ya girl, she'll forget you
And I'll be the only one she concerned with
To the people that ignored me before this
This one is for you as a song re-recorded
Funny thing is, you just noticed me now but I was here all along
Your vision's just been distorted
I'm so throwed I live this, you ask me what the business
And I write a sixteen and report it
The waiting is over I think music need it
Drake cuttin his records without gettin weeded
People in the South want it chopped and screwed, I got this dude
They expectations I'mma exceed it
Like a singer with only backgrounds ya'll record it
When it's done ya lyrics tend to mislead ish
Finally here I'mma star with the timing
My swagger is chill, and my flow is reclining
This for anybody that's searchin for cash, and purchasing fast
You only get the dough when you grindin
And so I grind like I'm listening to I Wayne
My pain, you can experience through the rhyming, boy!

[Hook] (x4)[Intro]
La la la la
Listen
La la la
Hey

[Verse 1]
Didn't you know I can help or hurt you
So there's no reason to lie
I bet you let those other niggas jerk you
Convince you that they are fly
I never said I was an angel
Said but I ain't like those other guys
Listen
You're convinced that our experience rearranged you
Well maybe you should re-examine how you tried
Or...

[Hook]
Am I high
Babe, am I high
Am I high
Ooh high, yeah

[Verse 2]
I think I've loved you since our high school
But you only wanted friends of mine
So when they replied
Her she's cool
Only then you gave our friendship time
You won't say it but you think I'm changing
Is it because the whole world calls me drugs
Didn't I say I can help or hurt you
You should be paranoid without me
And with me feel a buzz
Is that cocky?
Or...

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Malice]
It's the kinda high that got me leaning
120 speeding in the rain
Meaning of a hydroplane
Play both sides of the field
See I know 'caine
Keep 'em high like Kurt Cobain
Listen
I'm known for speaking my mind
Known for fleeing from the scene of a crime
Eyes redder than the beam of my nine
Eyes redder than the scene of that crime
All for the love of the lime
I'm so high

[Verse 4]
Insinuating you're not that way
I see how you look and use your eyes
But when I ask you can I jump in
Then you start again with the lies
But if I dare you you'd blow a kiss to another
Though my friends have no idea who you could be
Don't worry I would never tell another
But I ate your pussy as you layed there beside her yes she was asleep

[Hook]

[Outro]
Why am I sitting here
Peering the sky
Is there something inside of me, or am I high?
From when we talk on the phone, 'til when we fuck
This sounds like deep lust to me
But I get high on your love
Am I high?[Intro: No Malice]
When I was a child
I thought as a child
I talked like a child
I even reasoned like a child
But when I became a man
I put away childish things

[Verse 1: Ab-Liva]
It's like the blind leading the blind
They caught up in the shine
The tokens of success is not clearly defined
The watermelons gone and all that's left is rind
And yet you keep eating, eating
But in the back of your mind
If somewhat you rewind
Ever wonder why they continue to let you dine
Place a glass ceiling, continue to let you climb
Place drugs in the hood and pretending to let you grind
That little job they pretending to let you find
Boxed in, they continue to let you mime
That little deal they continue to let you sign
Peep it, they spent more on spilled wine
Yeah, I gotta speak to my kind
Call me 8:45 cause both hands on the 9
It's from the heart and it's so sincere in every rhyme
I could let the wheel go, the Lord steers every time
If no child left behind, black faces on the first 48 look like mine
Yeah, cause when that nigga in a bind
The ones in position from my view look like Shyne
Damn, and we the culprit in the crimes
In the pulpit, niggas lying, they just pokin' at the lion
'Til my soul start flying or frying, I'mma be defiant
It's written on the wall like a Mayan

[Interlude: No Malice]
You know, the truth is a funny thing
I mean, it's a double-edged sword
It separate bone from the marrow
Spirit from the flesh
And if it's a lie, then say it's a lie
But if it's the truth
And that saw hits you
All you better do is say ouch

[Verse 2: No Malice]
It's of a biblical proportion - what you are witnessing
Spiritual abortion - slaughter of innocents
Guilty as charged, destruction of a lineage
Now pray father God, you allow me to repent of it
And any crime scene that bear Malice's fingerprint
I pitched those keys like a tent, without thinkin'
Even served our own mommas, without blinkin'
Walking dead, clueless, no inkling
Within a twinkling, seeing what I was made of
While y'all speculate Clipse break up
Well think it not strange if I'm Abel to his Cain
Hell, even Esau had a Jacob - I ain't trippin'
And what's with all this swag I ain't feelin'
Gotta get that money, huh, nah, I'm chillin'
And I ain't sellin' my soul for no million
Cause that dead-end rap can't even crack its glass ceiling
Why such blasphemy
And anger toward a God which none hath seen
Hmm, leads me to believe
That there's a wee bit more to this Jesus thing
And they use his name to sell them pies
Cause it take a lot of truth just to sell that lie
Yes, even now I repent
Of the circus acts, same clowns, different tent

[Outro: No Malice]
I mean, if we gonna kill the kids
Then let's kill the kids
Pop that molly, right?
I mean, load them choppers, right?
Homeboy, the line's been drawn
And if you find it evil to serve the Lord
Then choose this day
Whom you will serve[Eric David]
But I know I'm going to change that tune
When I'm back on top
Back on top in June
That's life

[Hook]
That's life
That's what all the people say
You're riding high in April
And shot down in May
That's life
And as ugly as it may seem
Some people get their kicks
Stomping on your dreams

[Verse 1]
Just the other day I'm riding on my high horse
Custom leather seats in the Porsche to die for
The jewels alone made him sick, I am an eyesore
They couldn't see me like Stevie, Mon Cherie Amor
With three or four baddest of my women friends
One in the front, two in the back of the latest Benz
Rims spinning, tires Pirelli
Happy days, I'm Fonzerelli
What you gonna tell me, am I not the realest?
$1000 bottles, just so I can spill it
In the VIP, standing on the couches
Talkin' cash shhh cause my money's where my mouth is

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Ain't nothing like having that rug pulled from under you
Kick you when you're down, no one gives a number two
Down but not out, so you should never snooze
Cause the dude who's at rock bottom ain't got nothing to lose
If you know who you are, you ain't got nothing to prove
Cause to me, red bottoms ain't nothing but shoes
Win, lose or draw, I'm working on these flaws
I just wish chicks would stop throwing me their draws
Judas kisses, lying to the missus
Racing to hit the street, looking for my mistress
Now look at me, looking for forgiveness
And trying to put my thing where I ain't got no business

[Outro]
What goes around comes around
What goes up must go down
I said, What goes around comes around
What goes up must go down
I said, What goes around comes around
What goes up must go down
I said, What goes around comes around
What goes up must go down[Hook x2]
Fire, fire they can't touch the fire
Fire, fire, internal fire
Fire, fire they can't touch the fire
Cause a red hot fire gonna burn for a while

[Verse 1: No Malice]
The price of hell has its benefits
I pray you not be ignorant
Clearly I am seeing with
My all-seeing eye, no pyramid
I, too, was a derelict
The truth raised me from the dead when I became aware of it
Riding Tony's coattails
Now Tony in a cold cell
Wife home, miss him a lot
She might wait, she might not
Looking at a whole family torn apart
Man, this game colder than a whore's heart
And we don't cop pleas
Never mind snitching, we better not sneeze
Did I scale them keys? You be the judge
Every good boy deserves fudge

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: No Malice]
Led to the slaughter, precious is the blood
That stained the cross, there's no greater love
Like the days of Noah, no greater flood
Than when them birds got shipped, no turtledoves
Maybe a few chickens
That I saved, for the drought, when it was slim pickings
Then with one touch my soul became quickened
When I revisit my past my soul becomes sickened
Clock's ticking, go check your Audemar
The bezel on that Chopard will only get you so far
Mozart never tickled this many keys
And your favorite emcees ain't who they claim to be
The cat's out the bag, whoops! Shame on me
I don't fear death, they tell me it come in threes
Be ye not deceived, we reap as we sow
Life, too, comes in threes: Father, Son, Holy Ghost

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Hell or high water, we gon' keep rollin'
Looking in my watch it's like hell freezed over
Hell, money couldn't hold my composure
Bull in a china shop, that's how I'm bulldozin'
Gene found God, they thinking we at odds
Must ain't know my father, he ain't never spared a rod
Yuugh! It's two sides to a card
Just opposite ends of two peas in a pod

[No Malice]
And I owe it to my Granny who instilled the fear of God
In the heavens looking at me, receiving this Grammy nod
The game camouflage like S.W.A.T. Team riot gear
Dudes is facades in this lane we pioneered
Now they can't wait 'til we drop, that's diarrhea
I found God, the rest found jail like Madea
That's what you get when you pumping that Britney Spears
Now how you gon' act at the truth that's in your ear?

[Hook x2][Verse 1]
In that all too precious blood, I am covered
This is for you, dearly beloved
For every D-boy on the corner
Mason jar in the cupboard
This is for you, dearly beloved
If I could
I would take back every foolish word that I uttered
I owe that to my momma
Knowing how much she suffered
Her first born taken by that 80s holocaust
Then I turned around, served it a la carte
I'm all apart inside
Can't breathe, chokin' on my windpipe
Every time my nephew say he wanna rhyme
And I know he got to question
Why I don't give him my blessing
That's only because I love you like you mine
And I refuse
We lose another
Your father is my brother
Them pipe dreams, let 'em burn
I can't usher
You in this game, knowin' it's a lion's den
I tell you like I tell my own son
Reach higher than

[Hook]
Chasin' that American dream
But life ain't always what it seems
So I had to bury that
Should have known it was a scheme
Any time E (Maserati E) took one for the team
Man, I had to bury that
Half of my homies is in the bing
But y'all don't see behind the scenes
Lord knows, I had to bury that
Out there hustlin' that Medellin
David Banner, all I saw was green

[Verse 2]
They would have you think I am at odds with my sibling
How they look alike, yet bear no resemblance
All hail the Clipse and all of their magnificence
But I cannot deny my deliverance
It is no coincidence
That God choose to use my brethren
To show the magnitude of these ties I'm severing
The fight's fixed, especially ya top 10
Can you trust a list in which Pusha isn't mentioned in?
Really?
Who copped a milli of them kilograms
Broke 'em down, chopped 'em up
Like a ceiling fan
We gave you truth, y'all ain't want it
Y'all wanted spoof
Now I'm Holy Ghost filled like I'm haunted
A warning, it's time to fall before Him on your knees
It seem like everything that's real is what you won't believe
Please, it's time to let go of the past
Of the best duo ever
I guess I am an outcast

[Hook][Verse 1: No Malice]
Lord have mercy and pity on your son
From what I once was, to what I have become
Forgive me for my past and the noses left numb
As I'm led down this path to the beat of a different drum
Fee-fi-fo-fum I'm conquering my giants
And all by my lonesome I'm conquering Goliath
I cut it on the buyers, now I trade in the triple beams
I'm Tebow to the game and I done traded teams
The slate is clean and ever since I've been delivered
My flow got em guessing like rock paper scissors
Before the feds came we were already prisoners
32 years made us all reconsider
The holy ghost in us, so whoever got a gripe
Prove the devil's alive and well, Tyler got it right
How long can you live with your hands up in the white?
Jesus or the Judge? They both offer you life

[Hook: Lecrae]
I fall on my knees when I rise
Thank him for my breath, opening my eyes
When I leave my home, if I meet my demise
Even the darkest day will see the sun rise
[x2]

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Come as you are is what they told me, so I paid attention
And I ain't wore a suit to church since Jordan was a Wizard
Father forgive em they betrayed us with a kiss (mwah)
Hate what they can't understand, I'm so ambiguous
I spazzed on the pharaoh, the pathway is narrow
Eye of the bull on my back, looking for an arrow
Lying like I wasn't tempted by that double barrel
If gangstas don't dance, why you tappin' with the devil?
My two left feet won't let me dance to his beat
Sick of livin' in Hell and I'm allergic to the heat (it's cold)
And imperative you listen to my narrative
They sellin' false hope like a sedative
I don't think the world is aware of it
Maybe they don't care a bit
They think we all fam but it's relative
Try to think my flow is irrelevant but they don't know a thing
Crucify me next to thieves, I'm still gon' rise a king (Crae)

[Hook][Intro]

I go against the grain, see I’m in my own lane
They only seem first ‘cus I’m in reverse
It’s like I moonwalk on em
Ain’t nothing like having said yes to your calling
I get better with age while time’s evolving
I’m a vintage wine, I’m a retro Jordan
So mature, Mr. Thornton
If I turned my back you’d be left orphaned
I caution against sun belief
I guess that make me old school like a dungaree
But my britches don’t sag, bout riches I don’t brag
But somehow I can’t help but to show my ass
Class is in session
Chain heavy like opression
The new me got em dancing
So I tell em if they got any questions read them

[Hook: Famlay] (2x)
It’s a ______ shame, you stayed in the game
It’s a _______ shame, the things people to say to make some _______change
When you dropped your top you lost your _______ brains
Hah, let me think about it

[Verse 2: No Malice]
Within every lyric, you can tell when you hear it
The KRS-One, black cop in my spirit
Twilight saga, the flow cannot be mirrored
Only by its grace we escape judge and juror
One thing I’m sure of, Lord as my witness
Show me 10 kingpins, I’ll show you 10 snitches
They said I lost my mind but I got all my senses
Nothing but the truth in all my sentences
Always gave me truth
Even in my offences the feds came knockin
Turned all my niggas Christians
We was in the kitchen, watering the pot
Playin Top Chef til Tony got shot
Wake up call, it was like time stopped
But you gotta love Tony cuz the dime never dropped
Yes, the check is in the mail
Commissary baby and your kids are eating well

[Hook: Famlay] (2x)[Hook: No Malice]
Bowing down to riches, bow down no mo'
Tricking on these misses, bow down no mo'
All these dudes is snitches, bow down no mo'
I'm on top my business, bow down no mo'
Bow down no mo', bow down no mo'
Bow down no mo', bow down no mo'
Bow down no mo', bow down no mo'
Bow down no mo', bow down no mo'

[Verse 1: No Malice]
God bless the child, that God is on
I don’t look to mama, her baby grown
We would ship em' in then we get em' gone
You could smell it on me, like a cheap cologne
He pardoned my wrongs, that’s what the father said
It’s like I had no soul, I was the walking dead
Had to get ahead, ain’t got time to sympathize
I was selling that rock, and if he dies, he dies
So cold blooded but flooded was the bezzle
I was praising god but living like a failure
How could I meddle, all them years I peddled crack
I did it the best, how can I call the kettle black
Big and bad, out here acting like nuttin' phase me
If Tony is arraigned I would cry like a baby
Look at his baby, snot with the ugly face
Listening to some jurors, singing bailiff come take him away

[Hook]

[Verse 2: No Malice]
Those were the days, I remember them well
At the Mariott, laying up with Jezebel
Don’t kiss and tell, this could be our little secret
Telling me she loved me and I believed it
Looking back, oh what a fool I was
Different chick every night, like it was humorous
It fueled my lust but now I hang my head in shame
They got the nerve to ask, did they really hustle caine
Yes indeed, them chickens really flew the coop
Crack the gong with them birds, cock a doodle doo
Them other dudes on the mic, ain't telling you the truth
That’s why I been sick of rap, chicken noodle soup
New recruits better salute, papa don’t play
They got me taking off my belt and hear Sa Da Tay
What'd I say? Fix ya' face and pull up ya' bridges
Save the riddens, one half of the Clipse, no more collisions

[Hook][Verse 1]
In that all too precious blood, I am covered
This is for you, dearly beloved
For every D-boy on the corner
Mason jar in the cupboard

[Hook][Verse 1 - Kelis]
He has an appetite, for sex and cash
He hangs on the corner, talking trash
Or rollin', in his freak mobile
Mercedes Benz, on 20 inch wheels
Gets calls all day, on his cellular phone
From nasty girls, they won't leave him alone
He's got 'em cryin', cause they can't see
Why he's in love, with a girl like me
Innocent, kinda polite
The kinda girl, that says her prayers at night
He picks me up, everyday from school
And all my friends, they just dream and drool
And on the way, the music blasts
We hit my street, he lets off the gas
Just before, my house appears
He pulls over, and whispers in my ear

[Hook - Pharrell]
Hey little mama let me in your world
I just wanna see you be a nasty girl
I said love you up and love you down
Daddy wanna make love all around town
You scream, ahhh
Come moan and moan and moan, ahhh
Come moan and moan and scream, ahhh
Come moan and moan and moan, ahhh
Now take it back girl

[Verse 2 - Kelis]
My mom's met him, my dad refused
Yesterday, he brought me some shoes
Dolce, and Gabbana
And a bag made of Iguana
And a blazer, and a chocolate tie
Get it blaze, chocolate tie
So this kept on, and it kept on
Like the beat don't stop, until the break of dawn, c'mon

[Bridge - Kelis]
I can't help it
I just love the boy
I just love the boy
Wait a minute, oh
I can't help it
I just love the boy
I just love the boy
Oh no

[Verse 3 - Kelis]
I got shining things, like diamond rings
And designer chains, man the way I bling
Had teachers from school, callin' home
Mr. and Mrs. Nice, what the hell's going on
I snatched a letter, from your daughters desk
From her bad boyfriend, who was talking fresh
How he wants to see her, later today
Face to face, so he can say

[Hook - Pharrell + Kelis]
Hey little mama let me in your world
I just wanna see you be a nasty girl
I said love you up and love you down
Daddy wanna make love all around town
You scream, ahhh
Come moan and moan and moan, ahhh
Come moan and moan and scream, ahhh
Come moan and moan and moan, ahhh
Now take it back girl

[Verse 4 - Malice]
But you gotta know that the dough comes first
Gotta know if you stray, then no, there are no words
Ma look, I can see it in your face, aww look
Thought I was a nice guy, huh, nah look
You say you'd never leave me love
Well, are you sure that its me you love
Gotta ask, cause I can't tell, if it's me, or the V12
Hell, its suspect but you'll swallow my pride, now let's ride

[Bridge x2 - Kelis]
I can't help it
I just love the boy
I just love the boy
Wait a minute, oh
I can't help it
I just love the boy
I just love the boy
Oh no

[Kelis *Ad-libs* until fade][Verse 1: No Malice]
Lord have mercy and pity on your son
From what I once was, to what I have become

I’m different (I’m out of this world)
The king in that king, the queen in that girl
You’re different, you can stand out
If you wanna leave the orchestra
Turn your back on the crowd
‘Cus you’re different
Turn your back on the crowd
‘Cus you’re different
Turn your back on the crowd
‘Cus you’re different
Turn your back on the crowd
I’m different, she different

[Verse 1: No Malice]
Now is the time
Let this be the hour of
You being a difference, you ain’t gotta be no follower
25 to life, that’s right go ahead count em up
Tony got 400 months, you do the algebra
‘Cus I’ve yet to get it figured
The grass grown green and everything that glittered
Won’t go, funny how things unfold
The way I once start is so troubling my soul
Straight to the hole, I'll take it, the lane's open
I’m done moving the keys, I’m Beethoven
So sold out for the Lord, I’m out jocing
Some friends were like baby shoes, I’ve outgrown em
Truth be told I’m guilty as the next man
So my rhymes channel, Brother J from X-Clan
Man how could I ever leave be?
I can’t leave rap alone, the game needs me

[Hook: PK Oneday and Bri]

[Verse 2: No Malice]
Yea, I march to the beat of a different drum
You can probably tell my speech, bear a different tongue
Well I just hope it reach even if it’s one
Louie this, Gucci that, shut up you sound dumb
I know where I’m from, I’m chief sinner
I know better, just got a different agenda
I remember winter, in the cold we were selling it
Swear we would never snitch, now everybody telling it
Guess loyalty before the judge is irrelevant
I’m waiting for the light bulb to cut on like Edison
It’s evident we all gon make mistakes
When the feds got daytime in place
I’m pleading my case so you ain’t gotta proceed to the bench
Run Toby run, another brother lynched
Another brother pinch, doing bits, pulling time
My message aimed at the kids without a 9
Be different!

[Hook: PK Oneday and Bri]

[Outro: No Malice]
Baby girl, I’m here to tell you
You ain’t gotta pop it, you ain’t gotta drop it
Shake it, twerk it or bounce it
And you are still just as beautiful
You know? Be different
Turn your back on the crowd
Turn your back on the crowd
Turn your back on the crowd
Turn your back on the crowd
If you wanna lead the earth just turn
Turn your back on the crowd[TALKING]
I do this for ya'll man
Malice, Nickelus F, it's the REMIX!

[VERSE 1: Malice]
Lights slow motion, steppin' out the Phantom
All eyes on me, peekin' and glancin'
Leanin' on the wall, with b-boys dancin'
Ears, neck, and wrists lookin' like the king's ransom
One chick, each arm, makin' it a tandem
Flat here costing' like fifty grand standard
Bottles poppin', cars wit' options
We livin' like kings, homie, you just watchin'
And I'm a show for ya, marble flo' for ya
And that thing in the driveway, came with the spoiler
I ain't bluffin', cop jewels off the Russian
Diamonds in the Jesus, look like he's blushin'
Miami breezes, we cross seasons
Escaped indictments, thank you Jesus
Y'all haters ain't even got a clue
While we get this paper, and that's how we do

[BACKGROUND]
R-E U-P G-A-N-G
R-E U-P G-A-N-G

[Hook](x2)
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

[VERSE 2]
Check, the verses I'm writing you might wanna learn it
You hatin my song but your wife wanna burn it
So now you at the store for some blank CDs
You can't see me, for your sake might wanna return it
Cause, if you bring them discs home to ya girl, she'll forget you
And I'll be the only one she concerned with
To the people that ignored me before this
This one is for you as a song re-recorded
Funny thing is, you just noticed me now but I was here all along
Your vision's just been distorted
I'm so throwed I live this, you ask me what the business
And I write a sixteen and report it
The waiting is over I think music need it
Drake cuttin his records without gettin weeded
People in the South want it chopped and screwed, I got this dude
They expectations I'mma exceed it
Like a singer with only backgrounds ya'll record it
When it's done ya lyrics tend to mislead ish
Finally here I'mma star with the timing
My swagger is chill, and my flow is reclining
This for anybody that's searchin for cash, and purchasing fast
You only get the dough when you grindin
And so I grind like I'm listening to I Wayne
My pain, you can experience through the rhyming, boy!

[Hook] (x4)[Hook]
Hear Ye Him or hear Him not
You either fear me or fear me not
I know you see clearly, I'm coming for that spot
So, you need to fear me like I fear God
Hear Ye Him or hear Him not
You either fear me or fear me not
I know you see clearly, I'm coming for that spot
So, you need to fear me like I fear God
Hear Ye Him

[Verse 1]
I should've been dead a long time ago
I offered it death, and almost said line I wrote
Camouflaged it and act like I had offered hope
The gold chain was steady hanging, ni**as choked
My older brother was my hero till he started dope
Wish I could've stopped his very first line of coke
But, I don't judge
We all got a guilty pleasure
And bless my mama heart, she still believe he getting better
That's faith and every man was dealt a measure
That's why I believe every word in red letter
I ain't no better cuz' even I supplied em'
For 15 or 20 I provide em'
But, never deny the man that's steady gettin' mad
At every time he begged for cash, I oblige em'
My conscious is speaking kinda loud lately
Lord forgive me, I done killed my mama's baby

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
The Gospel is foolish to those who are perishing
They nod and dose, minus the heroin
The truth's obvious, maybe too evident
But, clearly Malicious is something I should've never been
Here's to the death of him, we gon' say a prayer
I gave ya'll way enough time to prepare
For my second coming
That was the rehearsal
When the real second coming come, there is no reversal
Pusha, I'm the first to admit I want to see ya' win
But, when we die, I wanna know I'm a see you again
And to my baby, I know I hurt you badly
For way lesser, I seen my mama leave my daddy
So, I gladly accept the fact you know I try
I guess that make you the wife, minus the y
I sigh, only cuz' I know the truth
YOLO?? You only live once if you choose to

[Hook][Eric David]
But I know I'm going to change that tune
When I'm back on top
Back on top in June
That's life

[Hook]
That's life
That's what all the people say
You're riding high in April
And shot down in May
That's life
And as ugly as it may seem
Some people get their kicks
Stomping on your dreams

[Verse 1]
Just the other day I'm riding on my high horse
Custom leather seats in the Porsche to die for
The jewels alone made him sick, I am an eyesore
They couldn't see me like Stevie, Mon Cherie Amor
With three or four baddest of my women friends
One in the front, two in the back of the latest Benz
Rims spinning, tires Pirelli
Happy days, I'm Fonzerelli
What you gonna tell me, am I not the realest?
$1000 bottles, just so I can spill it
In the VIP, standing on the couches
Talkin' cash shhh cause my money's where my mouth is

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Ain't nothing like having that rug pulled from under you
Kick you when you're down, no one gives a number two
Down but not out, so you should never snooze
Cause the dude who's at rock bottom ain't got nothing to lose
If you know who you are, you ain't got nothing to prove
Cause to me, red bottoms ain't nothing but shoes
Win, lose or draw, I'm working on these flaws
I just wish chicks would stop throwing me their draws
Judas kisses, lying to the missus
Racing to hit the street, looking for my mistress
Now look at me, looking for forgiveness
And trying to put my thing where I ain't got no business

[Outro]
What goes around comes around
What goes up must go down
I said, What goes around comes around
What goes up must go down
I said, What goes around comes around
What goes up must go down
I said, What goes around comes around
What goes up must go down[Intro: Ghostface Killah]
Yo, Oh, Yo Rae... I can't feel my face
My heart pounding and shit (audible heart)
Paranoid as a motherfucker right now, who the fuck?
Close the blinds and shit! Who that? Captain Kirk?
The Stark...enterprise, enterprise I was on and some shit?
..I need some pussy though I'm ready for a Catwoman or something
F-fuck it, lets go!
Aiyyo Shareefa go to the store for me. I need some razors and a fresh box
Of baggies, the ones with the tint in them!
Aiyyo son turn that water down a little bit, just a little bit..Thank You
I need two waters, a dutch, and a cranberry Snapple)

[Hook: sample (Ghostface Killah)]
All around the world today, the Kilo is the measure
(Whoever got the kilos got the candy, man)
A kilo is a thousand grams, its easy to remember
(You never catch the kid going hand to hand)
All around the world today, the Kilo is the measure
(Once you got the funds you got the panties, man)
A Kilo is a thousand grams, its easy to remember
(Throughout the I 9 to 5 I'm the Handyman)

[Ghostface Killah]
Racing through the hood, ski mask off
Criminology hustle, when goons play the heat, blast off
And every direction, protect ya babies, your moms
Late night like Carson Daly, Theo Bailey, we stay armed
Grits box, vacuum tight, concealing the powder
Five fake cans of blow to throw them off wit the flower
Red dots on me, big scopes, bullets the size of nickels
Got Starkey coming out of his coat
I gots to jet, don't look back, my cardio's killing me
Old ladies is like 'Hold ya head, Tone, literally'
All this, for a thousand grams?
I'd rather be a con artist scheaming with a thousand scams

[Hook]

[Raekwon]
Aiyyo peace to those cooking that raw, powder white
Get your sniff on, scarface niggas, we getting right
Some call it bricks, some call it birds
How many niggas get they lives tooken playing with shit, then catch a curb
You would go to jail
Get caught with this, niggas'll grow to fail
Stop playing, pot slaying, baking soda and scales
They lived like brothers, word life, connects discovered
Most niggas get hard, from fucking with them pipes and hustlers
Kilos is one thousand grams
You know your ammo better be heavy cause soon kids is coming in camo
Protect your land daddy, I'm an announcer
You get caught with an ounce and its over
Matter 'fact they takin you down, son

[Hook]

[Ghostface Killah]
Bricks, Tar caps, powder, cooked up crack
Phones is tapped over franklin's stacks
Kingpins put in bullpens, old connects get paro'
Break out of town when the Jakes take down the Pharaoh
Reason, He was moving that peruvian white
Blowing coolies into hoopties , slamming cuties and ice
Big heavy pots over hot stoves
Mayonnaise jars of water with rocks in them got my whole projects out of order
A Kilo is a thousand grams
Beige, gold, brown, dirty, fluffy, tan, extract oil cut from cuban plants
The chemist is brolic, pyrex scholars
Professors at war over raw, killing partners for a million dollars

[Hook]

[Ghostface Killah]
Some say a drug dealers destiny is reachin the ki'
I'd rather be the man behind the door, supplying the streets
A hundred birds go out, looking like textbooks
When they wrapped and stuffed
Four days later straight cash, two million bucks
Strictly powder, no cut
Your coke is vialed in, whats up?
Y'all beefin over little shit, we sniff, the balance split up
In a plane or a penthouse, office or a warehouse
Tony's got it nice, we never heard of any big droughts
A Kilo is a thousand grams
A pile of sand is equivilant, to the eye
It's nice to have a thousand fans
Coke buyers, some be liars
Therefore, you check for wires
Dedicated dealers, during holidays we give 'em lighters

[Hook: Ghostface Killah]
Red tops, blue tops, green tops, yellow tops
Purple tops, beige tops, white tops, grey tops
Black tops, clear tops, gold tops, pink tops
Silver tops, tan tops, aqua tops, orange tops
Salt tops, long tops, short tops, 12 12's
58 58's, weed bags, ziplocks
Big rocks, coke spots, big Glocks, one OT's
Crumbs chopped, hot pots, one plate, crack Spot

[Hook]

[Malice]
Thirteen getting it, pyrex whipping it
Like UPS, pack it up, shipping it
Whether base or sniffing it, I got your fix
The story's foretold like apocalypse
It was me Michael T.T., handing out freebies
Taking over blocks, telling niggas to be fee
Where big brother 'Vine'll leave the body in the street
Something kinda like how I be bodying the beat
We was 300 deep like the Persian soldiers
Word spread fast, we was serving boulders
Ten crack commandments, holy Moses
If you don't fit must equip icer toners
Never grip they holders, fingers to the snitchers
The New York niggas be taking all our bitches
But we be God damned if taking all our business
Duct tape, hard tops, C.S.I. forensics

[Hook][Intro: No Malice]
Lord have mercy and pity on ya son
From what I once was to what I have become
Lord have mercy
L-L-Lord have mercy
L-L-Lord have mercy and pity on your son

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Dark past full of evil endeavors
Heart clean never, black and ugly as ever
However, I seen my family die from them rocks
Them fiends on blocks, including my own pops
Homie, I seen two much to drink them two cups
Can't lean on the lean, already way too screwed up
Was way too gone, I was way too cold
Fifty yard Hail Mary, I was way too thrown
I was Tarzan, raised by gorillas and the beasts
High on them trees when I gorilla the beats
Then that truth came hit me, took me outta my grave
All my partners say I'm changed, how I'm going stay the same, huh?

[Hook 1: No Malice]
Lord have mercy and pity on ya son
From what I once was to what I have become
Lord have mercy and pity on ya son
From what I once was to what I have become
Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy
L-L-Lord have mercy
L-L-Lord have mercy and pity on your son

[Verse 2: Tedashii]
Killa, tryna murder it chasing ladies down for fun
Saying, "Come with me", Hail Mary but then kill her son
However, I seen them boys man, take that bar and wait for God say?
Beastie boy, he still took three the hard way?
Toss me up, Hardaway, crucifix no jewelry
These wooden beams he took from me
Took them up to Calvary while I was a DGK
Whylin out to UGK, runnin' from the HPD
Huffin puffin Mary Jane, no Rick James man
I was looking for a super freak
Nasty, cameo, candy, super sweet
But now your boy turnt up, free from all them chains
Volume on ten, you can call it unashamed

[Hook 2: No Malice]
Lord have mercy and pity on your son
From what I once was to what I have become
Lord have mercy and pity on your son
From what I once was to what I have become
Lord have mercy and pity on your son
From what I once was to what I have become
Lord have mercy
L-L-Lord have mercy
L-L-Lord have mercy and pity on your son

[Verse 3: Lecrae]
Now I'm turnt up daily, I'm on my one-eighty
They thought I'd water it down, I'm like boy y'all crazy
On my J.O., my O.J. Mayo, I'm on my Grizzly
Jesus turned me 'round me so fast that you would swear I was dizzy
Now they askin, "Who is he?" Now they wonderin' my name
I run in my own lane screaming, "Jesus is King!"
Till my heart stop pumpin, no more blood in my veins
Watch me turn up everyday, homeboy, I'm so unashamed!

[Bridge: Lecrae & Tedashii]
Turn up boy, turn up boy
Turn up boy, turn up
Turn up boy, turn up boy
Turn up boy, turn up
Turn up boy, turn up boy
Turn up boy, turn up
Turn up boy, turn up boy
Turn up boy, turn up

[Hook 3: No Malice]
Lord have mercy and pity on ya son
From what I once was to what I have become
Lord have mercy
L-L-Lord have mercy
L-L-Lord have mercy and pity on your son

Lord have mercy, Christ have mercy
Lord have mercy on me
Lord have mercy, Christ have mercy
Lord have mercy on me[Hook]
My Recipe’s My Specialty
Whip Game is sickening, is sickening
How this ‘caine be running through your nostrils like (x4)

I’m on my grind seven days of the week
Gotta get mine, no time to sleep
The life I live does not come cheap
Can’t turn back now cause I’m in too deep
Dot every “I” cross every “T”
Play it to the letter “A” through “Z”
Ain’t learn yet, shame on me
The hustle don’t stop nigga rain nor sleet
Nigga hail nor ice
The re-up charm got my name in lights
Don’t get caught with your hand in the white
Cause this shit here get you jail for life
And I’m in to win, shawty wanna hop inside my Benz
Start talking bout being more than friends, girl save the chat for the BBM
Re up gang we be them
Get it for the low off Mexicans
Anthony G like next of kin
Thought we was done well guess again
Just me and Slim taking a trip around the bend
The coke come back like a second wind
Victory lap, breathe out breathe in[Hook]
There is no time
To say what I feel

[Verse 1: No Malice]
It’s kinda hard to articulate
I guess I’m in a different place
Different space, different time
I reason with a different mind
What I’m sayin is the things that I once loved
I now find myself ashamed of
In the game we done came up
But we ain’t all had the same luck
Some of us heard the gavel slam
With all that snow came an avalanche
Did we ever really stand a chance?
Well now it’s out of our hands, mercy
Your little man¨, 3rd grade
In little league, 1st place
Proms, birthdays
We miss you in the worst way

[Hook]
There is no time
(There’s no time)
To say what I feel
(But I have to say what’s inside of my heart)

[Interlude 1: Jaeson Ma]
The most valuable asset we have is time
How do we use our time?
All we have is right now
All we have is this moments
I don’t want to have regrets
I don’t wanna die thinking about what I should’ve done
But it’s never too late
For our God is a God of second chances

[Hook]
There is no time
To say what I feel

[Verse 2: No Malice]
The things I call regrets
Are the things that made me my best
He made a message out of my mess
So now my heart is a under arrest
I confess I was misguided, misled
No laws, I’m runnin a rep
Roulette, gun in my hand
You don’t have to die to already be dead
Think twice, life or death, choose life
Some things are elementary
Sometimes we create our own misery
But no penalty, you can let it go
He gave me a voice when I should’ve been an echo, echo…

[Hook]
There is no time (I hear You)
To say what I feel
(There’s a voice crying out in the wilderness)

[Interlude 2: Jaeson Ma]
I don’t care what you’ve done
Abortion? Adultery? Murder?
There is no condemnation
You need to know this
There is a redeemer
Have you tried everything?
Are you the same place you were in last year?
At this time, then read the signs
Don’t just watch the throne, pay homage to it

[Hook]
There is no time
To say what I feel

[Interlude 3: Jaeson Ma]
Don’t be mistaken
One who has unreliable friends soon comes to ruin
But there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother
We all, at some point in time ended up ?? world
We’ve all had the conversation with the old man
We all shook hands with the devil
And had fun doing it
But when is enough enough?
Are you getting nowhere fast?
Take a look in yourself, is this the real you?
Is this who you wanna be?
For, I know the plans I have for you
Declares The Lord
Plans to prosper you and not to harm you
Plans to give you hope and a future

[Outro Speech: No Malice]
I think the misconception is...
That there is good people and bad people
You see The Bible clearly tells us in Romans
As it is written,"There is none righteous
No, not one."
And in 1 John
It says "if he have no sin
We decieve ourselves and
The truth is not in us."
And even in Jeremiah
It says that "the heart is deceitful
Above all things and desperately wicked
Who can know it?"
So, The Bible is very clear on the sinful nature
Of man
The difference is
Whether you are repentant
Or not
Are you remorseful and seek forgiveness?
Or, are you laughing, dancing, smoking, and joking in your sins?
That is the difference
Then, some may say
Well, you can just go on sinning, knowing
That you will be forgiven
And to that I would say
This is where belief comes in
Cuz' if you truly believe
That Christ literally
Died for your sins
Was flogged
Beaten
Spat on
Pierced
A crown of thorns placed upon his head
And nailed to a cross
If you truly believe this
Then, there is no way you can continue
To glory in your wickedness
God is not a man that He should lie
Nor is He the son of man
That He should change His mind
He is the same
Yesterday
Today
And forever
So, if you want to recieve Jesus
As your Lord and Savior
All you have to do is
Repeat these words

[Prayer]
God, I recognize that I am a sinner
I recognize that I am unable to save myself
I ask you for your forgiveness
And I accept your Son, Jesus, who died on the cross
For my sins
And rose again
Please fill me with your Holy Spirit
And lead me all the days of my life
IN JESUS NAME, AMEN[Hook x2]
Fire, fire they can't touch the fire
Fire, fire, internal fire
Fire, fire they can't touch the fire
Cause a red hot fire gonna burn for a while

[Verse 1: No Malice]
The price of hell has its benefits
I pray you not be ignorant
Clearly I am seeing with
My all-seeing eye, no pyramid
I, too, was a derelict
The truth raised me from the dead when I became aware of it
Riding Tony's coattails
Now Tony in a cold cell
Wife home, miss him a lot
She might wait, she might not
Looking at a whole family torn apart
Man, this game colder than a whore's heart
And we don't cop pleas
Never mind snitching, we better not sneeze
Did I scale them keys? You be the judge
Every good boy deserves fudge

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: No Malice]
Led to the slaughter, precious is the blood
That stained the cross, there's no greater love
Like the days of Noah, no greater flood
Than when them birds got shipped, no turtledoves
Maybe a few chickens
That I saved, for the drought, when it was slim pickings
Then with one touch my soul became quickened
When I revisit my past my soul becomes sickened
Clock's ticking, go check your Audemar
The bezel on that Chopard will only get you so far
Mozart never tickled this many keys
And your favorite emcees ain't who they claim to be
The cat's out the bag, whoops! Shame on me
I don't fear death, they tell me it come in threes
Be ye not deceived, we reap as we sow
Life, too, comes in threes: Father, Son, Holy Ghost

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Hell or high water, we gon' keep rollin'
Looking in my watch it's like hell freezed over
Hell, money couldn't hold my composure
Bull in a china shop, that's how I'm bulldozin'
Gene found God, they thinking we at odds
Must ain't know my father, he ain't never spared a rod
Yuugh! It's two sides to a card
Just opposite ends of two peas in a pod

[No Malice]
And I owe it to my Granny who instilled the fear of God
In the heavens looking at me, receiving this Grammy nod
The game camouflage like S.W.A.T. Team riot gear
Dudes is facades in this lane we pioneered
Now they can't wait 'til we drop, that's diarrhea
I found God, the rest found jail like Madea
That's what you get when you pumping that Britney Spears
Now how you gon' act at the truth that's in your ear?

[Hook x2][Intro: No Malice]
When I was a child
I thought as a child
I talked like a child
I even reasoned like a child
But when I became a man
I put away childish things

[Verse 1: Ab-Liva]
It's like the blind leading the blind
They caught up in the shine
The tokens of success is not clearly defined
The watermelons gone and all that's left is rind
And yet you keep eating, eating
But in the back of your mind
If somewhat you rewind
Ever wonder why they continue to let you dine
Place a glass ceiling, continue to let you climb
Place drugs in the hood and pretending to let you grind
That little job they pretending to let you find
Boxed in, they continue to let you mime
That little deal they continue to let you sign
Peep it, they spent more on spilled wine
Yeah, I gotta speak to my kind
Call me 8:45 cause both hands on the 9
It's from the heart and it's so sincere in every rhyme
I could let the wheel go, the Lord steers every time
If no child left behind, black faces on the first 48 look like mine
Yeah, cause when that nigga in a bind
The ones in position from my view look like Shyne
Damn, and we the culprit in the crimes
In the pulpit, niggas lying, they just pokin' at the lion
'Til my soul start flying or frying, I'mma be defiant
It's written on the wall like a Mayan

[Interlude: No Malice]
You know, the truth is a funny thing
I mean, it's a double-edged sword
It separate bone from the marrow
Spirit from the flesh
And if it's a lie, then say it's a lie
But if it's the truth
And that saw hits you
All you better do is say ouch

[Verse 2: No Malice]
It's of a biblical proportion - what you are witnessing
Spiritual abortion - slaughter of innocents
Guilty as charged, destruction of a lineage
Now pray father God, you allow me to repent of it
And any crime scene that bear Malice's fingerprint
I pitched those keys like a tent, without thinkin'
Even served our own mommas, without blinkin'
Walking dead, clueless, no inkling
Within a twinkling, seeing what I was made of
While y'all speculate Clipse break up
Well think it not strange if I'm Abel to his Cain
Hell, even Esau had a Jacob - I ain't trippin'
And what's with all this swag I ain't feelin'
Gotta get that money, huh, nah, I'm chillin'
And I ain't sellin' my soul for no million
Cause that dead-end rap can't even crack its glass ceiling
Why such blasphemy
And anger toward a God which none hath seen
Hmm, leads me to believe
That there's a wee bit more to this Jesus thing
And they use his name to sell them pies
Cause it take a lot of truth just to sell that lie
Yes, even now I repent
Of the circus acts, same clowns, different tent

[Outro: No Malice]
I mean, if we gonna kill the kids
Then let's kill the kids
Pop that molly, right?
I mean, load them choppers, right?
Homeboy, the line's been drawn
And if you find it evil to serve the Lord
Then choose this day
Whom you will serve[Hook: Ishod]
It’s true (so true)
Things ain’t what they used to be (Things ain’t what they used to be)
Everyday life changes
But you need to know
That I still got love for you
(I still got love)

[Verse 1: No Malice]
Now when I say brother, I’m talkin the same mother
We still blood when the fans no longer love us
I had to break apart to honor who is above us
But you should take heart in knowing I got you covered
I see you in the public, now how can I not love it?
We fought for this life and now you making something of it
Well check it little brother, the one thing I discovered
Them riches be where lust in, count em all as rubbish
‘Cus it’s more than evident that these things are perishing
Without them I still see the questions, that Terrence (?)

[Hook: Ishod]
It’s true
Things ain’t what they used to be (Things ain’t what they used to be)
Everyday life changes (Ab-Live I see you)
But you need to know
That I still got love for you (Can not forget Sandman)
(I still got love)
And everything we see
Ain’t what it seems to be
Everyday life changes
But you need to know
That I still got love for you
(I still got love for you)

[Verse 2: No Malice]
And all is well with Pharrell
Star Trak that forever
Promotions from the lord so it was all for the better
The money never made us so how could the money break us
It’s only God who says He would never forsake us
What could ever shake us and even to this day
Our etiquette way tighter than any dame in J
Trust me when I say that my love for you runs deep
I could never be faking, kiss yo mama on her cheek
Anyone can see what you have added to my life
So I must say thanks again bro, this is only right

[Hook: Ishod]

[Verse 3: No Malice]
For every heart broken and every lie spoken
Try not to blame yourself, girl my caine was truly potent
My verses you were quoting while reclining in my coupe
Then I went, scooped up yo friend
How much lower could ones do?
Thinkin it was cute, all the games we were playin in
Please forgive that little boy, he hadn’t any sense
I was dead wrong, Jesus come to my defense!
And have mercy upon my soul when I approach that bench
This pain is too immense, guess it’s time I faced my karma
So reluctantly I pray you meet your knight in shining armor

[Hook: Ishod][Hook]
What I've done is unforgettable
My track record's incredible
The way I moved in the trap was so impeccable
It's identity fraud
The way I hear my signature all in your bars
It's so legible
Unforgettable, unforgettable, unforgettable, unforgettable
Let the games begin
As they reminisce over you, my god

[Verse 1]
As I reminisce on what could have been
The choices made, the situations that they put us in
Young world, take heed to these sentiments
Baby girl, don't you give up on your innocence
For that Louis bag or that Michael Kors
I myself included, who don't love a filthy whore?
But why sell yourself short
To hell with this paper and them lines you fell for
Cause we praying on self esteem
And I know your mama taught you better, bitch you a queen
And yes, I did my thing
But them keys can't play forever, nigga you a king
Just try to dig where I'm coming from
A checkered past, but look what has become of him
King me, as I bow down to the King's feet
Lord willing, we gonna come to the light
Now that's a prophesy

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
We all fall short of the glory that is God's
But something about these rappers reek of a facade
We were on the brick road, all the way to Oz
To pull the curtain back just to find it's a mirage
Late model cars, model broads everywhere
Careful where you tread, with every step the Devil's near
Caution beware, for blinded is him
Who calls it a trap yet still enters in
Dancing for ones ain't what I find demeaning
It's having to pick them up, that's dollar's a mean demon
Believe me, I too whored for that money
The best booga sugar, my pimp was a snow bunny
Got every red cent, papa was no dummy
Every chick bad, long hair with no tummy
You should learn from me, I suffered for my wrongs
They nose still running like a marathon

[Hook][Intro - Pharrell]
It's just that ghetto (*echo*)
Ghetto, ghetto, ghetto
It's just that ghetto (*echo*)
Ghetto, ghetto, ghetto
This ghetto (*echo*)
That ghetto (*echo*)
We still ghetto (*echo*)
That ghetto (*echo*)

[Verse 1 - Pharrell]
I've been thinkin' lately baby
Maybe we should leave here tonight
I've been pushing papers crazy
Even if it's wrong I feel it's right
Maybe we can make sweet love
Girl I know it feel so good
In order to escape this pressure
You know what, we should

[Chorus - Mary J. Blige]
Steal away
Steal away
Leave for a day
We'll never say
We should have, left much more soon
For one night, let's share the moon
Can we make love, all damn day
Let's steal away

[Verse 2 - Mary J. Blige]
You know I really need you, sugar
I want you to make me your wife
I can't wait till we leave out
So we can be together, there's no doubt
That my love, it has no limits
So I will wipe away your frown
Packed all my sexy secrets
Now I'll join you, for the rest our lives

[Chorus]

[Bridge - Mary J. Blige]
We should have left, much more soon
For one night, let's share the moon
Can we make love, all damn day
Now steal away

[Verse 3 - Malice]
For sure ma, I steal away
Car keys to my man's Benz, and peal away
Spillin 'Ze, whether your man like it or not
He ain't diggin' it right, so I'ma be pipin' the lot
I see a hot mami, hold on if you able
We put a flake on your hand, I'll floss your navel
What it costs, I'm able, to make you happy
Whether it's the back of the Four Dot Six (4.6) or the Navi'
Blankets and pillows fluffed up
And we shine like we puffed up, blowin' that 'dro till we fucked up
His luck's up, I just stole his honey
Own his honey, he wilin' like I stole his money
His gold is honeys, my gold is money, he can have my wife
While me and you live that lavish life
With your V. Secret satin tight, thongs and bras
I'm hoping to God this ain't no mirage

[Chorus x2]

[Outro - Pharrell]
It's just that ghetto (*echo*)
Ghetto, ghetto, ghetto
It's just that ghetto (*echo*)
Ghetto, ghetto, ghetto
This ghetto (*echo*)
That ghetto (*echo*)
We still ghetto (*echo*)
That ghetto (*echo*)
This is one of those records
My pops used to listen to ya know
Let's ride, chillin' with the gangsta lean
Mary got the gangsta lean
Come on, the Neptunes got the gangsta lean
