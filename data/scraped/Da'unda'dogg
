Some motherfucking gumbo?
[Mac Dre]
Yeah nigga, gum in the mother fuck bo
[Da Unda Dogg]
Like that there?
[Mac Dre]
Yeah, I got my niggas in here, we finna put it down
You know what I'm saying, real, real special
You know? Check it out, like this here

Verse1(Mac Dre)
As I get to bustin'
This introduction
Of mind corruption
And rhyme seduction
I steal and fill brains
With game and mo' thangs
Like them dope thangs
And what that ho brang
Creep on Crest streets
Speak on fresh beats
Hit the motel, and freak on fresh sheets
And wet sheets, is the end result
Been killing long cock since ten years old
See I blend this old-game with this new
And ain't no telling what a bitch will do
Now picture you
In my position
Steady getting sweated by the opposition
Could you handle
All this scandal
And keep on stepping like boots and sandals
My handle, is young Mac Dre
Silky slim, is my A.K.A
And you know that bay is my rompin' grounds
I mean stompin' grounds
But I like the way Rompin' sounds
So I'ma keep it
Romp related
And if it ain't down with the romp, I hate it

Verse2(JT the Bigga Figga)
Well let me jump into the pot with all the hustlers and players
Chop potatoes with Phillie faders,Knocking niggas with Tre Eights
But now I
See my niggas at the spot with the session
Illegal product
Then people plotted, rotted with no confessions
Smith and Wessons
Demonstrations with Fully Autos, actin'
Conversations at the lab to keep the trackers trackin'
Double backin' to the spot where all the money filter
Keep it on the down low
You never tell about your scrilla
On the reala
I breaks it down in all directions
It's the Fillmoe players with the O
And the Crest connection
All in the session with my folks, You know they got the Dolo
Hit the gateway tracks, like some fiends in a forward Volvo
Bought a Bolo
Seen Kelly, mashed off, and then we hollered
Trailing Coolio and Mac Dre in a green Impala
Getting cloudy
The laboratorys just like a porny
Got a patient
Cousin Quinn is making the shit get saramani
Hella fetti
We ready, steady, with all the bumbles
Keeping it real with Dangerous Dame and Mac Mall in this fucking gumbo
Straight paper
Straight fetti
Straight gumbo

Verse3(Dangerous Dame)
Niggas we pull
Niggas will say so
We hit the strip from San Jose, to Vallejo
Make more scrilla by the mouth piece
Non-talking niggas don't know shit about me
Ignore 'em like bitches
Respect
There ain't a hand out
Like a sore thumb, fake niggas always stand out
Player hater prayer
Praying that I buckle everyday
Ain't worth five cents, or my knuckles to the face
But my burners ain't feeling no flesh
If you niggas wanna test
Let it jump and we could put the shit to rest
You thinking deeply
But I be on service like a shark
Consider me that hate, but see I serve you from the heart
Cause love loves me
And hate loves me
So what the fuck you think?
You can't fuck with me
You paying dopefiends, to put 'em to work
But now your money's gettin' low
While I be getting low with this wicked flow
You got at me last night
But I wasn't asking who was bustin' the trigger
I'm blowing big bomb smoke, yelling "Nothin' ass nigga"
My pimping ain't soft
I'm taking no losses
So why the hell do you persist to put me in crosses?
You thought it was shackles, but then they was ropes
And now they're spider webs
I broke on you hoes
I know what you're doing before you do it
Got an outside plan, but in the end you're looking stupid
Huh, yeah
Cause Dangerous Dame got 'em riding on the freeway
Actions speak louder
I don't fuck with he say-she say
Think you got game?
Never could you have it
You niggas are crying wolf, while I'll be fucking Jessica Rabbit
Straight trading places
But fool this ain't no dream
You was happy as hell when you had me under your infra red beam

Once again, get low for the East O
Add a little recipe to the gumbo

Verse4(Da Unda Dogg)
Add me
Mix me up
Stir me in the pot with these niggas that fix me up
See, back in '91, Coolio was the shit
So now we cooking a batch of gumbo and it ain't gonna quit
My nigga the Bigga Figga, adding that spice so fool it's saucy
You bitches thinking you'll eat for free, well this shit is costly
So back up off me
And recognize the sound is poppin'
Beause we steadily droppin' dope, like the keys you coppin'
Mother fuckers, they get to actin foul
When they know they can't fuck with the style
Smile punk mother fucker, sucka, hating bustas
Ain't no friends when it comes to ends, so you can not trust us
But trust me
You can not dust me, or try and bust me, dumbo
Your ass gets heated in this pot of gumbo[Hook: repeat 4X]
(Back 2 Da Basics Overlaps the Chorus)
Doing The Same Ol Thang

[Da Unda Dogg]
Back 2 Da Basics where I won't sell yak
See I got get back mothafuck the jacks
Strapped me a gat just in case of the rap pack
I got another five to survive
My boss keep sweatin' me workin' me fo days
Shit can a nigga get a raise
Man I got a child to support and this ain't workin'
Can't pop yay cuz the police is lurkin'
It's gettin to point where I'm bout to say fuck it
Jackin' muthafuckas in a bucket
Then I'll be back where I started straight cold hearted
My family would look at me retarded disregarded
Because I must get risk legit
A couple Benz and a kit and they can't do shit
See they got theirs, and y'all got y'alls
And now its time to get mine and plus I got balls
Boss fo a sec as nigga run a check on this microphone
To see if its on

[Hook]

I called a few friends
And see if they could front me some ends
They all talking about it depends
What I need it fo. Now ain't that strange?
How money make muthafuckas change
And I bout had it with this job choppin down woods
While my homies choppin ki's in the hood
Livin' good, and I can't stand one mo case
Because the judge would throw the book dead in my fuckin' face
That's why everybody is willin' to die
To get a fat piece of the pie
I'm coming up dry, my pockets is chapped
I'm thinking about pimpin' the hoods up with the gat
Silly of me how dumb could I be
Its time to make a call to the homie MD
Can a nigga get plugged, I heard you got juice
And I got a few albums I'll like to produce
Don't sweat the style cuz I got flow
That why I called yo ass to let you know

[Hook]

Now everythings fine no more grime
The feds can't stick me with no more time
I told my boss that he could kiss my black ass
Cuz being on this team, the longer its gonna last
I made my rounds threw the jordans down
And off to the crest hittin' zest by the pounds
No more set trippin unless you want to trip
Wit my zest hit yo ass like a Vietnam vet
I bet I'll go far if I pursue to be a star
Eating chitlings and ham and I could give a damn
Bout Uncle Sam because my army's getting paid
Hittin' with the lyrics they know they can't fade
So I start scheming up a mission to plot
Avoiding three hots and a cot
I got to give a shout to my niggers in the pen
Cuz without yo help I'll never get in'
Gave a in' to my mom and I drop the bombs
Like the homeboy rhomes
Im Back 2 Da Basics

[Hook]

Doin Doin the same ol thing huh
Doin the same old thing[Mac Dre]
I be that cold crest creeper, stompin' and rompin'
Puttin' the crest on the map, like NWA did Compton
Got my finger on the trigger, dont make me pull it and bail
Plus I'm ski masked down, all you see is bullets and shells
From that HK, they say Dre is slightly crazy
But ain't nothin' but the way them crestside streets raised me
I'm shady, all my game make you trust me
Players love me, haters dodge and duck me
They hidin' while I'm ridin, Crestsidin' through the fog
I'm a double R hog, doin' dirt with my dogs
Crest gorilla makin' scrilla, boy I gets G's
Put more holes in a nigga than they put in Swiss cheese

[Sugawolf]
Now check credential, these niggas be killa status
Pack a tech, tote a tommy, you know I brandish
Some dont understand, niggas I hog about my scrillions
Pill young knuckle heads, stoppin by my building
Built in the game, foundated since '74
Its that Mark Ave nigga... You know
Get your millimeter, these niggas round here be heated
And if you need it, eat it up when I feed it
So giddy up, get game, if you ain't knowin' that it'll happen
Thats that real shit... fuck all that rappin'
So go on and ask your folks
Cause these crest niggas ain't no joke

[Jamar]
Pussy ain't the prize so you can miss me with that bullshit
Young hog through the hallways, strapped down with them full clips
Catch 'em on surveilance, a murder thats how I read it
So potna if you saw it, play like you ain't seen it
I'm the cleanest in this murder shit, cuddie who you with?
Represent that Sawyer all star killa click
Wave both hands and watch me yoked in the stands
This them creepers coward, so could you understand
Faulty information keep on gettin' sold to the FBI
So what you gon' do? big baller dont cry
Everybody in this world can't get by
We love to be high, so pop yo collar, let it go
Cause this crest creep shit is gettin' sold like blow

[Naked]
Look it, at who just crept up out the bushes
Without warning, swarming in black garments
Performing like an OG, crest vet, oh yes its Naked
But I'm forced to wear clothes, because its cold on the North Pole
This 4-4 got the enemy behind the line
Cause once they cross it, aww shit, another violent crime
Has been committed in the itty bitty city called Vallejo
All hell breaks loose when you fuck with lou
Me and my people cause we deep in this shit
Brought heat to this shit, just in case a hater wanna trip
Off the fact that the country club is in the building
Hit the ceiling with your 3 C's if ya feeling
Where I'm coming from, now who in the fuck you running from
Them cuddie top dogs are on there way and they coming dumb

[Da Unda Dogg]
Hoes they, hoes they love me
Cause I'm the U-N-D-A-D-O double G
Crestsidin', hittin' switches, let me drop you a line
If you ridin' then you bitches better be on time
You fucking with my pleasures now
In L.A., fuck Da Unda Dogg won't let you down
So let me bust a nut, we creepin', so hurry up get yo ass in this telly
No time for speakin', remove your clothes and lay on your belly

Block shit, bitches love to fuck with this

Reek Daddy the muthafuckin' instigator
Mr. get this shit started right now, fuck later
From the Crest to the muthafuckin' Midwest, Reckless

Bitch have you ever rolled with a rider?
Bouncin' in the low hollerin' out Crestsider!!
Ripped, dont even trip, its gon' be some more shit
I got the big clip, filled up with hollow tips
Cold Crest creeper and I always keep my cannon on me
Dont forget the dope cause I'm a lay you where you standin' homie
Ho if you know me, you know what I'm about
Act like a snake bit my dick and suck the poison out

[Mac Mall]
Cuddie I go way back, sippin' heem straight like chris mack
In the 'lac, yac up, aliens better back up

See there ain't nothing like that ball hog soup, for country club hog nuts
Smash fools like Barlow, serve big game like tip toe
Might catch me mackin' in Chicago
Smokin' on some ????
Pimp shit, talkin' smooth, armani man, I'm out to conquer the globe
Might start off in Vegas, hookers bringin' more of those papers
Boss mackin' got me scuffin' my gators
Call me Luke Skywalker, the alien stalker
Cuddie, fuck ya friends, ya folks, even ya potna
Lil' soldier got a chopper plus he gone off one
And OG's think the penitentiary is fun

Verse1(Mac Dre)
As I get to bustin'
This introduction
Of mind corruption
And rhyme seduction
I steal and fill brains
With game and mo' thangs
Like them dope thangs
And what that ho brang
Creep on Crest streets
Speak on fresh beats
Hit the motel, and freak on fresh sheets
And wet sheets, is the end result
Been killing long cock since ten years old
See I blend this old-game with this new
And ain't no telling what a bitch will do
Now picture you
In my position
Steady getting sweated by the opposition
Could you handle
All this scandal
And keep on stepping like boots and sandals

Silky slim, is my A.K.A
And you know that bay is my rompin' grounds
I mean stompin' grounds
But I like the way Rompin' sounds
So I'ma keep it

And if it ain't down with the romp, I hate it

Verse2(JT the Bigga Figga)
Well let me jump into the pot with all the hustlers and players
Chop potatoes with Phillie faders,Knocking niggas with Tre Eights
But now I
See my niggas at the spot with the session
Illegal product
Then people plotted, rotted with no confessions
Smith and Wessons
Demonstrations with Fully Autos, actin'
Conversations at the lab to keep the trackers trackin'
Double backin' to the spot where all the money filter
Keep it on the down low
You never tell about your scrilla
On the reala
I breaks it down in all directions
It's the Fillmoe players with the O
And the Crest connection
All in the session with my folks, You know they got the Dolo
Hit the gateway tracks, like some fiends in a forward Volvo
Bought a Bolo
Seen Kelly, mashed off, and then we hollered
Trailing Coolio and Mac Dre in a green Impala
Getting cloudy
The laboratorys just like a porny
Got a patient
Cousin Quinn is making the shit get saramani
Hella fetti
We ready, steady, with all the bumbles
Keeping it real with Dangerous Dame and Mac Mall in this fucking gumbo
Straight paper
Straight fetti
Straight gumbo

Verse3(Dangerous Dame)
Niggas we pull
Niggas will say so
We hit the strip from San Jose, to Vallejo
Make more scrilla by the mouth piece
Non-talking niggas don't know shit about me
Ignore 'em like bitches
Respect
There ain't a hand out
Like a sore thumb, fake niggas always stand out
Player hater prayer
Praying that I buckle everyday
Ain't worth five cents, or my knuckles to the face
But my burners ain't feeling no flesh
If you niggas wanna test
Let it jump and we could put the shit to rest
You thinking deeply
But I be on service like a shark
Consider me that hate, but see I serve you from the heart
Cause love loves me
And hate loves me
So what the fuck you think?
You can't fuck with me
You paying dopefiends, to put 'em to work
But now your money's gettin' low
While I be getting low with this wicked flow
You got at me last night
But I wasn't asking who was bustin' the trigger
I'm blowing big bomb smoke, yelling "Nothin' ass nigga"
My pimping ain't soft
I'm taking no losses
So why the hell do you persist to put me in crosses?
You thought it was shackles, but then they was ropes
And now they're spider webs
I broke on you hoes
I know what you're doing before you do it
Got an outside plan, but in the end you're looking stupid
Huh, yeah
Cause Dangerous Dame got 'em riding on the freeway
Actions speak louder
I don't fuck with he say-she say
Think you got game?
Never could you have it
You niggas are crying wolf, while I'll be fucking Jessica Rabbit
Straight trading places
But fool this ain't no dream
You was happy as hell when you had me under your infra red beam

Once again, get low for the East O
Add a little recipe to the gumbo

Verse4(Da Unda Dogg)
Add me
Mix me up
Stir me in the pot with these niggas that fix me up
See, back in '91, Coolio was the shit
So now we cooking a batch of gumbo and it ain't gonna quit
My nigga the Bigga Figga, adding that spice so fool it's saucy
You bitches thinking you'll eat for free, well this shit is costly
So back up off me
And recognize the sound is poppin'
Beause we steadily droppin' dope, like the keys you coppin'
Mother fuckers, they get to actin foul
When they know they can't fuck with the style
Smile punk mother fucker, sucka, hating bustas
Ain't no friends when it comes to ends, so you can not trust us
But trust me
You can not dust me, or try and bust me, dumbo
Your ass gets heated in this pot of gumbo(Mac Dre Talking)

I remember hot nights in December
Cali never felt like winter
But when it rains and pours feel like you getting yours
I recall car door slamming that nigga jamming
That pistol in yo throat talking bout who he gone smoke
Little do he know he fucking with my chips shit
And can't be having no other chips up in my dip with
All this drama, I caught up to my home girl
From the back, cracked him back showed him the real world
Like M.T.V, he fucking with you, he fucking me
Money push mo yak then Hennessey believe me
I got the scoop scoop fo ya all day
5 Footaz, Coolio Mac Drez-a

(Da Unda Dogg)
Niggas be always flossing like they getting laid
Major riches steady running this shit and pulling them licks
Nigga to pay them bitches ways to ho know letting da ho know
Ripping my walet like ambanizza, from L.A. 2 da bay to around yo way
I stay breaking da skizza, leaving it in her pocket the hataz will knock it
While fucking my nine up bucking my nuts suck on lyrics and duck em'
I got none on it, cuz if I want it then nigga im taking it
By shaking and baking it no mistake it but I be makin' it
The 5 Footaz and Mac Dre has got my back
They collaborated on this track fo' da phat pay

Garreteed the most, the place we gon fil up
Throw yo hill up, get ya scrilla

Disconnect the scandal to thick, plus im too sick

In the bay area, a hour from L.A

Young rompa room nigga gettin' riach
Im hard as a nugget ruget will slug it with any nigga
Who figures he bigga triggaz I squeeze and stack G'z
The seeds our three cees be having the vega lead
To slow my flow but no I'll never give her deez
Suckas will pump brakes, and I never pump brakes
The pettle to the metal whenever a punk fakes
Moving at full speed, choke when I pull weed
Fo I could be kool ki'ed cuz thats what a fool needs
I dive and dig in big butts and get nuts
Whenever she blow me homie and lovin' the shit fa
Cuz hittin' that ass slot is better than phat cock
I used to serve phat rocks, and kelpt the track hot
But now I spit shit, that hit and get grits
Legit it won't quit, if you do it dont quit
Cuz dealin' drug dealin' and killin' you and mine
And I almost ruined mine cuz it had be doing time
But now that im back black, im having a phat stack
Of scrilla to the filla, its fonk then im at that
Popeing like gasoline, slicker then vaseline
I raps in caps in head claps and get tangerines
Double R star putting in major work
For Young Dre, Big Doc, Freaky D, and Curt

With Jah Skills, Coolio, and mail, and Neb Luv

(Jah Skills)
All day everyday this what we do, steady da chips
(Neb Luv)
And the shit don't quit
