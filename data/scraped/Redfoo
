[Intro]
I got a bone to pick
I don't want you monkey-mouth motherfuckers sittin' in my throne again
I'm mad, but I ain't stressin'
True friends, one question

[Hook]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin', King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him, Kunta
Black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin', King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams... (What's the yams?)

[Verse 1]
The yam is the power that be
You can smell it when I'm walking down the street
I can dig rappin'
But a rapper with a ghost writer? What the fuck happened?
I swore I wouldn't tell
But most of y'all sharing bars like you got the bottom bunk in a two man cell
Somethin's in the water
And if I gotta brown nose for some gold, then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller

[Hook]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin', King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him, Kunta
Black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin', King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams... (What's the yams?)

[Verse 2]
The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor
Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires
24/7, 365 days times two, I was contemplatin' gettin' on stage
Just to go back to the hood, see my enemy and say...

[Hook]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin', King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him, Kunta
Black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin', King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him

[Verse 3]
(You goat-mouth mammyfucker)
I was gonna kill a couple rappers but they did it to themselves
Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin' "Compton!"
I should probably run for Mayor when I'm done, to be honest
And I put that on my Mama and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo woo!
Ah yeah, fuck the judge
I made it past 25 and there I was
A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin' "Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?"
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king

[Hook 2]
Bitch where was you when I was-
*POP*
(By the time you hear the next pop, the funk shall be within you)
*POP*
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin', King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him, (King) Kunta
Black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch where was you when I was walkin'
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin', King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him

[Outro]
(Funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk)
We want the funk
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it)
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it)
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it)
We want the funk
(Do you want the funk?)
We want the funk
(Do you want the funk?)
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it)
We want the funk

[Verse 1]
I heard it's your birthday
Grab a drink if you thirsty
I can see that you need an OG
That I can do you the best and the worst way
Pop it like a go-go, drop it like a low-low
What's that? It's a go-pro?
So I can watch that back, HD, slo-mo

[Pre-Hook 1]
I don't care if it's the first date
I'll take you back to my place
We can skip first base
Cause a player like me
Tryna slide into home plate
Clap clap, make it clap
Lights on, lights off
Make it clap
Yeah, make it clap
My name ain't Santa
But she sittin' on my lap

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I heard that you single
Now you talkin' my lingo
Let's play casino
Bring four friends plus you
Bingo! Yeah ain't nothing but a flirt
The way you bouncin in that shirt
It's amazing how you drop it
Pick it up and still make it work

[Pre-Hook 2]
Yo body lethal, I might LA freak you
Goddamn, that booty fat
Sittin high up on your back
What the fuck, did they feed she?
Clap clap, make it clap
Lights on, lights off
Make it clap

But they call me the Mac

[Hook][Hook: Redfoo & Ice Cube x2]

Drop to the drop, drop to the drop, drop, drop girl, drop
(If I hit the switch, I could make that ass drop)

[Verse 1: Redfoo]
Stop, drop, and roll it
I like bad bitches in that club that control it
If you tote it, uh huh, you get voted
And to my haters, I'm back moded
And we exploded on you motherfuckers
We took shots and reloaded on your motherfuckers
Ayy, I can't hear you talking to me
Don't interupt me when I'm talking to the booty

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
Stop, drop and pop it
And after you pop it, please put it in my pocket
Look here, I need a sponsor, we can turn the city out
You remind me of my drop top, titties out
Ooh yeah, and can spend about 50 thou
All you do is make 50 thou
We can run and go spend it now, haters
Realize it just don't stop, see you at them pearly gates
Hit the button that make you, make you...

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Drop drop it, lemme see you squat it
Type a nigga gettin' private dances in the public
Hit her from the back, grabbing on her shoulders
Hair weave killa, girl don't you get nervous
Cleaning some detergent, all my cars got curtains
I love to light an oven
My Rollie cost a car, and I don't have a car note
I took her from the bar to the car to the condo

[Hook]

[Outro]
Brought to you by Drop it like its hot and pick it up like’s not production[Verse 1]

I walked into the party
I seen somethin' I never saw
Everybody was movin', groovin
Girls, they were dancin' on the bar
Now this wasn't no ordinary dance
Hey man why is everybody swimmin' in a trance?
I couldn't figure it out like your grandpa's riddle
I asked 'em what they doing and they said Juicy Wiggle!
(Now move your hips and dance like fish)

[Chorus]

Get Juicy

Man turn down for what!?
Give me a shot (Woo!)
Another shot (Woo!)
Y'all ain't ready for me to show you what I got. (Woo!)
Then my body froze up, it was getting to my head
What if I can't do it?
Then everybody said...

[Pre-Chorus]

Ah, get Juicy
Ah, get Juicy

The heat between you and I retreat to the morning light
We like to live like class
And pour them shots up in the glass
But there is no, there is no getting over you

CHORUS (Red Foo) x 2
I gotta know
Are you my dame
Is this for real
Is this a game

Verse 1 (Figgkidd)
Now lady listen to me, its getting necessary
I'm not talking mentally, I'm talking sexually
I wanna fondle with every crack and crevice
You know who I am, so how you dancin ain't a service
It's simply the fact that you up to actin like u mine
Coz I rap and Figg up in the club with TECH N9NE
Now whether or not my first album is hot
I'm gettin women's attention as soon as the shit drop
OOOWWWW
I don't do this 'hip hop'
I'm rock star material, smashin stage props
I'm lost within reason that's why you pleased to meet me
And when I step in your region you only meetin to please me' right??

CHORUS x 2
I gotta know
Are you my dame
Is this for real
Is this a game

Verse 2 ( TECH N9NE)
If you want it you gotta, come to the tele with me
Spit, rum on your belly quickly, sip some til you tell me quit me
And my hormones, more on, than four zones, ignore phones
Reachin for sore bones
Skip the jeffin lift your dress and come excite me, bite me
Hop in the Jacuzzi and get hyphy, might be
Doing my thizzle, X ignites me, psyche
Strip me from my t-shirt to my Nikes
Let me slow it so you know that I really mean this
English, fiendish, dream this, bring this
Tunnel cream lipstick, stop your trippin
Cause the Tecca Nina's cunnilinguistic
I gotta know if you're my ho
If you're my friend, if you're my foe
And don't tell me it's gonna cost me
Cause I'mma playa off in the club with Lui and my homie Figg
And yes I'm kickin it with the Aussies, I gotta know

CHORUS x 2
I gotta know
Are you my dame
Is this for real
Is this a game

BRIDGE (FIGG and Red Foo)
I think I'm lovin it
Coz you hot and bubblin (OOHHH)
I know you're hustling (ON THE FLOOR)
So now I'm wonderin (WHAT YOU WANT)
If you wanna be with me (YOU KNOW THAT)
You gotta sip the D (OOWWWW)
I-C-K you see (OHHH)
So come and play with me

Verse 3 (FIGG)
Now every single minute and second
Tech and Figg are left to inspect the opposite sex
Yo that's when I get
In situations I hate, coz then I can't be debating
Topics on maybe you not coming coz I got 2 Asians waiting lady?

CHORUS x 2 (blended with BRIDGE)

BRIDGE x 1

Sweatin' like we were just tipin' a fight
Finish last too much to handle
I got something big to put on your mantle

[Interlude 1]
And it ain’t a Mackerel
And it ain’t a Jackle

But it'll last forever
And it ain’t a sweater
And it ain’t pleather
More like a leather
Lets sing together

Juicy...
I walked into the party
I seen somethin' I never saw
Everybody was movin', groovin
Girls, they were dancin' on the bar
Now this wasn't no ordinary dance
Hey man why is everybody swimmin' in a trance?
I couldn't figure it out like your grandpa's riddle
I asked 'em what they doing and they said Juicy Wiggle!
(Now move your hips and dance like fish)

[Chorus]

Get Juicy
Get Juicy
Yeah, get Juicy
Get Juicy
Get Juicy
Yeah, get Juicy

[Verse 2]

Woooo Weeeii!
Now I done just lost my mind
All those people wigglin' they stuff..
(Hey man, you gonna do the dance?)
Man turn down for what!?
Give me a shot (Woo!)
Another shot (Woo!)
Y'all ain't ready for me to show you what I got. (Woo!)
Then my body froze up, it was getting to my head
What if I can't do it?
Then everybody said...

[Pre-Chorus]

Ah, get Juicy
Ah, get Juicy
Ah, get Juicy
Ah, get Juicy
Two girls was shakin' it, I jumped in the middle
I asked em what they doing an they said
Juicy Wiggle!

[Chorus]

Get Juicy
Get Juicy
Yeah, get Juicy
Get Juicy
Get Juicy
Yeah, get Juicy

[Verse 3]

Right about now..
We really gonn' have some fun! (Oh Yeah?)
I'm talking bout tickling ivory (Woo!)
But first, I need some 151... and a match
(Wooo Weeeii!)
It's time to light it up, lets go now!

[Pre-Chorus]

Ah, get Juicy
Ah, get Juicy
Ah, get Juicy
Ah, get Juicy
Ain't nothing wrong with making it jiggle
So when the beats drops everybody
Juicy Wiggle!

[Chorus]

Get Juicy
Get Juicy
Yeah, get Juicy
Get Juicy
Get Juicy
Yeah, get Juicy

[End Hook]

So when the beat drops, everybody Juicy Wiggle
Yeah, Baby
Wooo![Produced by Sounwave; Additional production by Terrace Martin]

[Intro]
I got a bone to pick
I don't want you monkey-mouth motherfuckers sittin' in my throne again
I'm mad, but I ain't stressin'
True friends, one question

[Hook]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin', King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him, Kunta
Black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin', King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams... (What's the yams?)

[Verse 1]
The yam is the power that be
You can smell it when I'm walking down the street
I can dig rappin'
But a rapper with a ghost writer? What the fuck happened?
I swore I wouldn't tell
But most of y'all sharing bars like you got the bottom bunk in a two man cell
Somethin's in the water
And if I gotta brown nose for some gold, then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller

[Hook]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin', King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him, Kunta
Black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin', King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams... (What's the yams?)

[Verse 2]
The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor
Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires
24/7, 365 days times two, I was contemplatin' gettin' on stage
Just to go back to the hood, see my enemy and say...

[Hook]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin', King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him, Kunta
Black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin', King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him

[Verse 3]
(You goat-mouth mammyfucker)
I was gonna kill a couple rappers but they did it to themselves
Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin' "Compton!"
I should probably run for Mayor when I'm done, to be honest
And I put that on my Mama and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo woo!
Ah yeah, fuck the judge
I made it past 25 and there I was
A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin' "Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?"
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king

[Hook 2]
Bitch where was you when I was-
*POP*
(By the time you hear the next pop, the funk shall be within you)
*POP*
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin', King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him, (King) Kunta
Black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch where was you when I was walkin'
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin', King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him

[Outro]
(Funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk)
We want the funk
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it)
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it)
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it)
We want the funk
(Do you want the funk?)
We want the funk
(Do you want the funk?)
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it)
We want the funk

Let me see you take it to the head
Girl I know that you can

Girl have you heard of my new super friends?

Get saxy, girl, get saxy

[Verse 1]
I heard it's your birthday
Grab a drink if you thirsty
I can see that you need an OG
That I can do you the best and the worst way
Pop it like a go-go, drop it like a low-low
What's that? It's a go-pro?
So I can watch that back, HD, slo-mo

[Pre-Hook 1]
I don't care if it's the first date
I'll take you back to my place
We can skip first base
Cause a player like me
Tryna slide into home plate
Clap clap, make it clap
Lights on, lights off
Make it clap
Yeah, make it clap
My name ain't Santa
But she sittin' on my lap

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I heard that you single
Now you talkin' my lingo
Let's play casino
Bring four friends plus you
Bingo! Yeah ain't nothing but a flirt
The way you bouncin in that shirt
It's amazing how you drop it
Pick it up and still make it work

[Pre-Hook 2]
Yo body lethal, I might LA freak you
Goddamn, that booty fat
Sittin high up on your back

Clap clap, make it clap
Lights on, lights off
Make it clap
Yeah, make it clap
My name ain't Apple
But they call me the Mac

[Hook][Hook: Redfoo]
We came here to party (rock)
We didn't come here to fight
I say, we grab ourselves a bottle
And toast to the good life

[Verse 1: Sky Blu]
Just cause a guy got a suit and a tie don't mean he gonna tax ya
Just cause I walk with a limp like an old school pimp don't mean I'll slap ya
But if you wanna talk tough, and you wanna puff up, then I might just have to
But I ain't come here to clock your mouth, (no!) I came here to rock the house (ho!)
Yeah, I get crazy wild, anything for the fans to make them smile
Goose and girls, that's my style, if you think I'm a thug, then you in denile
But you know when push come to shove, we protect ourselves and the ones we love
Stay at home, sit and judge, or celebrate life and hit the club

[Pre-Hook: GoonRock]
Everybody just wants to feel good
From up on Capitol Hill to the hood
Often times we get misunderstood
But tonight's our night

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Sky Blu]
They call you suit and tie, you's a politician
They call me super-fly, I'm always with two bitches
You go to church ties, I grew up with them scriptures
You on your P's and Q's, I'm sippin' Jeezy Juice
We both get a lot of attention in the press
You sellin' books and wanna be the President
We sellin' hooks, and the flow is heaven sent
We both hustlin', so why we tusslin'?

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]
It takes the heart of a champion
The fist of a fighter
Going the ditance to be the survivor
When you're losing, you're breathing
And then your body is sore
To be the last one standin'

It takes the heart of a champion, the heart of a champion

Yo, you gotta start aggressive
Keep your feet movin'
You gotta really want it
With everything you're doin'
Plan your work and work your plan
I like to hit winners, it excites the fans
And if it gets tough (tough)
And you fall behind ('hind)
That’s when you really focus
Positive mind !
You can come back and win and get the glory
This is what my daddy told me !

[Hook]
It takes the heart of a champion

[Hook]
You see me all over her, you want me all over you
Soon as I get rid of her, tell me what you wanna do
