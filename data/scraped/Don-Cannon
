[Produced by DJ Don Cannon and Kanye West]

[Verse 1]
I'm so bossy, bitch, get off me
It's a different jingle when you hear these car keys
Your SL's missing an S, nigga
Your plane's missing a chef
The common theme, see they both got wings
If you fly, do it to death
It's only one God, and it's only one crown
So it's only one king that can stand on this mound
King Push, kingpin, overlord
Coast Guard come a hundred going overboard
I got money with the best of 'em
Go blow for blow with any Mexican
Don't let your side bitches settle in
Might have to headbutt your Evelyn
Ballers, I put numbers on the boards
Hard to get a handle on this double-edged sword
Whether rapping or I'm rapping to a whore
Might reach back and relapse to wrapping up this raw
Givenchy fitting like it's gym clothes
We really gymstars, I'm like D. Rose
No D-league, I'm like this close
'88 Jordan, leaping from the free throw

[Break]
Ballers, I put numbers on the boards

[Verse 2]
(Mothafuckas can't rhyme no more, 'bout crime no more)
Mix drug and show money, Biggs Burke on tour
25 bricks, move work like chore
Hit Delaware twice, needed 25 more
I see flaw, cracks in your diamond
CB4 when you rhyme, Simple Simon
Come and meet the pieman, a must that I flaunt it
The legend grows legs when it comes back to haunt us
Ballers, I put numbers on the boards
Can't a bitch living say I bought her Michael Kors
Every car driven was decided by the horse
Keep the sticker in the window 'case you wonder what it cost
How could you relate when you ain't never been great?
And rely on rap money to keep food up on your plates, nigga?
I might sell a brick on my birthday
36 years of doing dirt like it's Earth Day, God

[Break][Produced by Don Cannon & Frank Dukes]

[Verse 1:]
What's in the back of my mind, sittin' in the back of that thang
With the two double R sittin' in the back of my brain
Anywhere but here, that's what I told my chauffeur
And this shit gettin' heavy, weight of the world on my shoulders
Think you figured it out, but you don't have a clue
Think you on top of the world but the world on top of you
I started hustlin' for draws and now there's plaques on the walls
Think I'm sellin' my soul? Then you can come get 'em all
Trade 'em all for my dawgs, yea, I'm talkin' to you
Where did we go wrong? Because I don't have a clue
You just wanna hit the mall and buy a new pair of shoes
But it's real consequences nigga remember the rules
So I regret the day you ever serve that nigga
Took 5 years of your life, you didn't deserve that nigga
I guess power and pain look it's somewhat the same
I lost my dawg to the fame, I charge it all to the game

[Hook:]
Please Lord forgive him, you know he got that thug in him
We lust for alcohol and we love women
And ain't nobody gave us nothin', so we drug dealin'
You know we coppin' Louie loafers just to thug in 'em
And when you made it that far, you should be makin' a toast
Got the seats reclined and I be doin' the most
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost

[Verse 2:]
I said we came so far but yet it feel so surreal
Hood nigga, half a mili, automobile
I'm talkin' real luxury, don't feel a bump in the road
We ain't like the rest of these niggas that fall out over hoes
Thought you my nigga forever, thought that you could be trusted
Man I found out you takin' it, really had me disgusted
Nigga, who am I kiddin'? It felt like a heart attack
Cause I gave you my heart and didn't ask for it back
And to be honest with you, I really thought we were brothers
Fuck everybody in this world as long as we have each other
Woulda done anyything, took a trafficking charge
Everyday on my head just to see you livin' large
Gangster pitted it kills, gave you your first mill
And I ain't tell you to blow it, I ain't tell you to throw it
You fell a victim to pressure, yea, I know it can stress ya
But you're only a man, homie, I can't be mad at ya

[Hook:]

[Verse 3:]
How can ya see out the windows between your shades and your tint
Sippin' good in the back, I'm like fuck it, I'm bent
If it don't make dollars, then it don't make any sense
They sayin' I owe 'em dollars and that don't make any sense
Almost fell for the bait, almost fell for the hate
And I'm the same nigga that let you niggas eat off my plate
Saw that shit from the door, knew that shit from the go
I guess this how I go, sit back and laugh at the show
Remember back in the day a nigga took your shit
Told you don't put it there and a nigga stole your brick
Didn't I put ya back on, did I handle ya wrong?
When niggas start actin' weak that means it time to be strong
See I kept it so real, I ain't keep it real with myself
I'm gone be real with you niggas, I gotta be real with myself
And I'm gone be real with ya homie, look you don't got me convinced
Is this payback for my sins? I guess I need to repent

[Hook:][Intro]
Tell to myself, still on fire
I'm under attack, but I'm still on fire
I got some chatter, but I'm still on fire
I got some threat, but I'm still on fire
I got some liabilities, but I'm still on fire
If it's not amazing that I'm on fire
I've been to hell and back, but I'm still on fire

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I swear the Lord is my shepherd, I'm 'bout to go cop a Lexus
I'm 'bout to go fuck Alexis,  take this and flood my Rolexes
This black on black is a blessin'
Black on black crime on my weapon
I protect mine on my mama and 'em, these my Usher confessions
Let it burn - Tee-Tee and Tiana sexting
Teepees and mansions I rest in
Two T's and Top Dawg impress with
TV's that play their investment
K-D-O-T go tee off and TG's and YG's gon' press it
It's our turn - I pray that I never lose you
Cause I like Benji and beaucoup bucks at my wrists
They do voodoo, curse you forever, you better not touch it
The clutching I'm used to, 250 speed racing crucial
Nigga, Vrrrrm
(Check that homie out, homie, that's K.Dot)
My youngins asking me do you consider role models useful
It's hard to say when I'm neutral, I'm tryna find out myself
Find inner peace inside heaven, find diamond piece inside hell
Will I learn

[Hook][Intro: Rich Homie Quan]
Talkin' big money, boy it come in thousands
Trap house bunkin', Jay runnin' out it
Rich Homie baby!

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
Big money, boy it come in thousands
Trap house bunkin', Jay runnin' out it
Twelve saw me comin', couple bats for me
I supply my neighbor, cul-de-sac money
(Whatchu talm bout Quan?)
Cul-de-sac money
Make so much that twelve double back for me
All I stack are dead men run it back for me
Like a dead end, cul-de-sac money

[Verse 1: Rich Homie Quan]
Cul-de-sac money, I got nosey neighbors
A couple packs comin', I’m at the store waitin'
Kill the fat onion, got some more paper
I keep the strap gunnin', I'm makin' dope wages
Your folks hatin', I got more paper
Your clothes basic, you see my ho tailored
All that makeup make your ho look made up
Cul-de-sac shoe strings got the hood laced up
I'm at the corner shootin' like a Pacer
“Reggie Miller I shoot a nigga face up”
And I like getting head cause I’m aimin' waist up
And if you owe me, better pay up

[Hook:  Rich Homie Quan]

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
I’m gettin' all this paper, A$AP money
And I’m fuckin' all these bitches, I can’t get ‘em off me
And I call my dollars Precious cause my pockets chubby
They was callin me ugly, now all of these bitches they wanna just fuck me
All of my niggas they hustlin’ and killin the game, this shit is a shame
I don’t mind niggas from Harlem, I did it, and you can do the same
I took money from out the hood he good now he dont have to gangbang
All of my niggas who figured they’re bigger but left
Are left feeling the pain (No Love)
He was a rider, ridin' in that Porsche
I’m the Messiah, I’ll be the young Trap Lord
Sippin' on the Henney, tryna get a penny, wigglin' a dime, nigga I take off
Pretty Flacko did well, now watch how Ferg go off, oh Lord

BONUS TRACKS[Verse 1: Jay Diem]
They promised me that dreams would come true
But forgot to mention that nightmares are dreams too
Watching people trying to make it out they mama’s home
I just write these songs trying to make it out my comfort zone
Life is zoning in and Im collapsing by the knees
From these people who keep on telling me who and what to be
A dollar and a dream? I got some anguish and some change
Sporadic thoughts and a catalog of rhymes to ease the pain
Painstakingly planning to take over the planet with an atom bomb
Trust me when I make a mill I’ll split it down with dad and mom
A house to add it on but what is all of that
To the ones who taught you, you could be ambitious young and black
Black card with a Fleetwood Mac hey you can do it
Just make sure in it all you don’t forget to love the music
And that’s the greatest thing they ever taught me
Lose your dreams and become nothing but a carbon copy
I got dreams
[Chorus 2x]
Mama I got dreams
Mama I got dreams
Mama I got dreams
They hate to see my spotlight beam and that’s why they won't let me be
They won't let me breath
[Verse 2: Jay Diem]
Working till my fingers bleed
Funny how Im dreaming but my sleep is now my enemy
I hate the bottom, patience is slowly rotting
Yo I dropped some classics back in autum you must not have got em’
There must have been a problem with the twitter links or something
To keep it blunt we hate the way they hate on us for nothing
They wanna cripple dreams like a crip out of east Compton or Chicago
Looking for a new watch with a cocked shotgun
Or half-cocked telling us stop like we got problems
For trying to be something other than teacher lawyer or doctor
Everybody just stand up, c’mon and put your hands up
This right here is the anthem, life ain't nothing but stanzas
Im just leaving a verse in the best way that I can
A dead poet in a society where they just brand us
But tell me what’s a poet if he don’t write
If I don’t change the world I just wish I could change my own life
[Chorus]Takeover

With the two double R sittin' in the back of my brain
Anywhere but here, that's what I told my chauffeur
And this shit gettin' heavy, weight of the world on my shoulders
Think you figured it out, but you don't have a clue
Think you on top of the world but the world on top of you
I started hustlin' for draws and now there's plaques on the walls
Think I'm sellin' my soul? Then you can come get 'em all

Where did we go wrong? Because I don't have a clue
You just wanna hit the mall and buy a new pair of shoes
But it's real consequences nigga remember the rules

I said we came so far but yet it feel so surreal
Hood nigga, half a mili, automobile
I'm talkin' real luxury, don't feel a bump in the road
We ain't like the rest of these niggas that fall out over hoes

Man I found out you takin' it, really had me disgusted
Nigga, who am I kiddin'? It felt like a heart attack
Cause I gave you my heart and didn't ask for it back
And to be honest with you, I really thought we were brothers
Fuck everybody in this world as long as we have each other
Woulda done anyything, took a trafficking charge
Everyday on my head just to see you livin' large
Gangster pitted it kills, gave you your first mill
And I ain't tell you to blow it, I ain't tell you to throw it
You fell a victim to pressure, yea, I know it can stress ya
But you're only a man, homie, I can't be mad at ya

[Hook:]

[Verse 3:]
How can ya see out the windows between your shades and your tint
Sippin' good in the back, I'm like fuck it, I'm bent

K-D-O-T go tee off and TG's and YG's gon' press it
It's our turn - I pray that I never lose you
Cause I like Benji and beaucoup bucks at my wrists
They do voodoo, curse you forever, you better not touch it
The clutching I'm used to, 250 speed racing crucial
Nigga, Vrrrrm
(Check that homie out, homie, that's K.Dot)
My youngins asking me do you consider role models useful
It's hard to say when I'm neutral, I'm tryna find out myself
Find inner peace inside heaven, find diamond piece inside hell
Will I learn

[Hook][Produced by DJ Don Cannon and Kanye West]

[Verse 1]
I'm so bossy, bitch, get off me
It's a different jingle when you hear these car keys
Your SL's missing an S, nigga
Your plane's missing a chef
The common theme, see they both got wings
If you fly, do it to death
It's only one God, and it's only one crown
So it's only one king that can stand on this mound
King Push, kingpin, overlord
Coast Guard come a hundred going overboard
I got money with the best of 'em
Go blow for blow with any Mexican
Don't let your side bitches settle in
Might have to headbutt your Evelyn
Ballers, I put numbers on the boards
Hard to get a handle on this double-edged sword
Whether rapping or I'm rapping to a whore
Might reach back and relapse to wrapping up this raw
Givenchy fitting like it's gym clothes
We really gymstars, I'm like D. Rose
No D-league, I'm like this close
'88 Jordan, leaping from the free throw

[Break]
Ballers, I put numbers on the boards

[Verse 2]
(Mothafuckas can't rhyme no more, 'bout crime no more)
Mix drug and show money, Biggs Burke on tour
25 bricks, move work like chore
Hit Delaware twice, needed 25 more
I see flaw, cracks in your diamond
CB4 when you rhyme, Simple Simon
Come and meet the pieman, a must that I flaunt it
The legend grows legs when it comes back to haunt us
Ballers, I put numbers on the boards
Can't a bitch living say I bought her Michael Kors
Every car driven was decided by the horse
Keep the sticker in the window 'case you wonder what it cost
How could you relate when you ain't never been great?
And rely on rap money to keep food up on your plates, nigga?
I might sell a brick on my birthday
36 years of doing dirt like it's Earth Day, God

Mastered by John Counselman[Verse 1]
I said Lord, I need an award
I had no money, now I spend it when I’m bored
I came from the bottom, they say ‘damn, that nigga saw it’
I feel my haters’ pain every time that I record
They say I’m too much
I was down, guess I done moved up
Money make ‘em hate a nigga more than the Ku Klux
You dude’s chuck, get a couple dollars, then move ses
Them few bucks?—Wifey spent more on her new butt
They say a nigga changed now, ‘cause I’m gettin’ change now
And I stay in something foreign, I ain’t on the train now
I ain’t on the A, but I’m probably in the A
Or somewhere out in LA, mobbing with my nigga Dre
I do whatever I want, I mean whatever I say
[If you cool?] stay out my way, you’ll get hit by a stray
I’m young, wild, and so foul, fuck a ref
See this Tec ‘ll go ‘blahh-oww’, and take your breath
I’m so fresh and so clean, and yet a mess
My eyes red, my dope green, just like the Jets
See nigga, I blew money before it was blue money
You niggas is too funny, your re-up is shoe money

[Hook]
Living amongst vandals, we hooligan’ed up
[Never maneuver with no handle, I shoot in a clutch?]
[He ain’t with us?], fuck, he was doing too much
You ever smoke a blunt and feel like it’s just you and the Dutch
Against the world that we be in, locked with a key in?
Can’t escape the hate even in a drop BM
[Ride, this shit rising, I’m poppin’ your BM?]
No surprise, why you think they roll their eyes when they see him?

[Verse 2]
Still on that same shit I’ve been on
I’m trying to get rich, y’all still tryin’ to get on
[The bitches ‘s what you’re set on?]
I’m really in the game, y’all just niggas that I shit on
Homie, I’m a legend, when I die I’m ‘a live on
I came up when that other nigga had gave up
I flamed up, I’m on fire, now who could tame us?
Wrist like Mr. Freeze, neck like Mr. T’s
Uncle tried to kick knowledge, I said ‘Mister, please’
I don’t think these books gon’ get me a Lambo
So I’m ‘a write these raps and let all of these grams go
For the low, ‘cause I’m about to blow up
Then shit on these hatin’ ass niggas until they throw up
Man, every time I roll up, I’m fresh, looking like I just caught a Zoe
Nah, I’m just takin’ bands every fuckin’ show
(You heard that?)
No more running out of [TD?]
I’m running in your girl when she see me on the TV
Neck all blingy, Loius V beanie
Hoppin’ out the Six with the seats all creamy
Ask your little brother, bet the nigga wanna be me
I get whatever I want, it’s like I’ve got a genie

[Hook]
