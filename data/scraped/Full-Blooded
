Big Ed, Full Blooded, and Mystikal
Whether it's in the bed with the hoes on these streets we go to war

[Big Ed]
The battles begun heavy kissing on the front line
Strategic and bout it to explode like a land mine
So you wanna go to war huh
You brought the camoflauge panties and maching bra to get down huh
Big Ed's a soldier and your a soldierette
Nuclear warhead in the trenches watch to get you hot and wet
Bet that a war would last as long as Vietnam
Bet that when you cum it will drop like atomic bombs
Bet that I pack a 50 cal. desert eagle
That will leave you shaking in the trenches here comes the sequel
Wondering what the gats and the blitz
Your grenade exploded so many times that you can't believe this
She look at me she swolled 220 and sewed up
]From the size of the monument, chocolate and tatted up

And a t-shirt go to hell with blood stain
And this TRU so too busy out for your loot
Enough surrounded by the stresses in black suits
Your girl polishes your shoes
Don't be mad you did what you had to do
The nigga died when you passed through
A half played the funeral around the clock

ChorusChorus: X2
Tell me what you're lookin' for, what you want?
Look inside my trunk you can find what you want

[Kane]
1008 grams in the trunk, that's a Kilo for you punks
Kane and Abel in this bitch, gettin' rich as Trump
Blowin' skunk on the I-10 to New Orleans from Houston
Alsmost home, hit Gotti on the cell phone
Get some B12, get out some pots
When I get there we gonna cook and chop these rocks
It's a never ending game, and my hustle don't stop
It's a devestating pain when I use my Glock

[Abel]
Chrome duce dutton and a chrome 600
High as the fuck, but we can still get blunted
TRU niggas don't talk, ya yap, ya get punished
A hundred G's cash in the stash (all hundreds)
Nigga bout to wreck shop
Post it up, on the high block, rocks and my polo socks
Just a young nigga hustle out the trunk for dough
Got the chip, flip phones by the corner store

Chorus X2

[Gotti]
I got the properest product
From the weed to the board to the pluck
Some chip phones to 6 shot chromes, so whats up?
Step in the cut
Don't let them feds no what's happenin' with us
Because they love to bust a nigga nuts
And have me hard to wear some handcuffs
So I keepin' my eyes open and my mouth shut
I only fuck with my gambino's
Cause everything that I do is illegal
From racketeering to casinos to choppin' weight
With my nigga Fino, me, Hound, and Kane and Abel
On a highway, cell phones on hopin' the feds ain't listenin' on three way
They tap our frequency
So we got to watch what we say, from New Orleans to L.A
We got money to make, Gotti, I play for high stakes
No mistakes involved, cause it could cause us to fall
Snitch nigga, catchin' slugs, ain't no love from us thug
Told me guns, or blood
So nigga what?
Keep that shit on the hush

[Full Blooded]
And step to the breeze way
Niggas with me to take it easy
I won't, but I can't face death when you squeeze me
Put the automatic Glock, up inside the clutched fist of a mask man
Ski mask man, yeah man, doin' bad man, cash man
I'm hound out, play my hood, hit blasa
Pass the herb, hit the curb, and I, leave 'em tied up in knots
First night murder, that's how we do it, thats how we did it
Who did it?
You know your boy, ? that run with No Limit
It was in some, white camaro, fuckin' window was tinted
They had noise in it, they had P boys in it, they had toys in it
Full Blooded
Niggas gonna respect that there
I'm a No Limit soldier
I can't neglect that there
Give 'em camoflague on my duty
Hand me the keys to the dooley
Give me a bullet proof, 2 PK's, when these niggas wanna do me
About this here, head bustin', throat cuttin'
Finger funk type shit, give a fuck nigga, smoke somethin'

Chorus x2

Until I slain motherfuckers who be ready to bust

[Lil Gotti Gambino]
Gotti be the title that I hold for sure
Pokin hoes after shows with my nigga Feano
Hit the scheme for your cream if you know what I mean

Studio B's if you pull em at ease, from New Orleans to ?????


[Big Ed]
Big Ed attacking, bred a No Limit soldier
Gettin bad with me, I screw your head off your shoulders

Baby girl and it's like that, it's a No Limit party

Chorus x2

[Kane & Abel]
My nigga Snoop brought the weed, Slim brought the liquor

Freak ho shake that ass while niggas tip her

Eyes hella red, Kane and Abel sessed out
Respect the tank, nigga stick my chest out
And this how we do it in the dirty south

[Magic]
Woah, please somebody tell me where the party at
I'm tired of holding back, I wanna shine in my cadillac
I'm here representing a soldier named Slim
See the tank on this neck, see the ice on this wrist
Picture this, I'm riding with Snoop Doggy Dogg
And so yall don't worry bout the corners, we smokin till the morning
Yall just keep the bitches, now we on the way
Hold on man I think Snoop got somethin to say

[Snoop Dogg]
Think fast when you dunk, cause I won't front
And when it's time to dunk I won't be no punk
I'll just pick the heater up and bust a shot
I'm the last nigga up to rock the spot
I'm represent a nigga to the fullest cause
And if yall wanna trip, we tear this club up (tear it up)
Huh bro, nigga nigga what, I'm tryin to bust again

Mo B. D. feel me niggas out the sess
Drink for drink and think to put in the fitty
Will he be that same nigga blowin doshia (say what)
Check this out, get the fuck out, party over[Crooked Eye]
The bullet missed me, I was high when they tried to get me
Had my nigga with me so them fools, they didn't hit me
Got the scoop from Tito, took out Vito from the corner store
With gold two toe, hit the floor, with four four
So I had to hit the floor, and bullet holes tuckin car doors
Me and B Mo out of pocket off of henny and coke
The closest heat is about fifty seven deep
I'm mad as fuck, I can't come back after o.z
The nigga that hit was intended to get
Was gettin told on (told on) by my homie on the mo phone
The game twisted, niggas crossin each other
Bullets they fly (fly), another nigga die
Why (why)

Chorus
[Billy Bavgate]
Niggas playin both sides
Usually in the end
A busta ass nigga die
[Crooked Eye]
Cross artists
Ain't no friends nigga
Mistakes can cost your lives
Niggas goin strike
And every man got a prize 2X

[Full Blooded]
I heard the shot shout, he took the bullets to his flab
Whatever he had done it don't matter (don't matter)
I seen him close his eyes before his body fell to the streets
Thirty two round clips and it left him beat for weeks
I roam the streets of a dead man
And only ranging on the ground lies a frame ??? brain
Too many cross artists ass niggas
Can't leave a house without the Glock
Too many dogs want Da Hound on my block
I watch that bitch in the rental contenintal
Back fillin up with bullets
Kinda knew it, it was my dog that pull it
Criss crossing ass niggas puttin shit in the game
And took the hit to the back by put the spit in my name

Chorus 2X

[Billy Bavgate]
Niggas playin both sides, usually in the end a buster ass nigga die
A little nigga tryin to get his stripes
The little young motherfucker love dumpin on site
The O.G.'s steady creepin from the sides
Gunshots rang out, slip into the night with a cold gunfight
See these niggas ain't right, Ghost Town niggas ride
Even when I'm high, crazy ass thoughts in my mind
When my own homie cross me in time
Cause he think I make mo money nigga when I grind
What the hell I'm gettin jacked by the one time
These some fucked up times
If any nigga cross the game then he dies

Verse 1 (Fiend) :

Fuck excusing and asking, you better take a look at my past tense

Laugh when you heard the slowest slurs in my word
Didn't think that the southerens could make you dance to the curb
Nerve, my word sent in my earb
Getting excited to make your money what its worth
Nigga act like you ain't heard, Sleepy Eye is the tone
Get It On Jones, about to bring it own home
Ship me then I'm gone, workin best for the loan
Started with a song, longer money and roam
Fuck anything wrong, you certified gone
I got one lil' homie that'll take it to your nose

Chorus: ( Fiend)

It's dangerous in our city
Nobody can tame us in our city
You ain't heard? We got gangstas in our city
Bangers in our city, and niggas ready to war if you try to rip me

Have money on machine, and make sure that the dope addict

Thugged out, ghetto star, livin' legend my nigga

Verse 3 : (Full Blooded)

You motherfuckers ain't smelling what?

Ribs showin', eyes glowin', I lie stunned no ??? one

My dogg told me not to take watch them take me out
Got me running closer to demonds
Motherfucker, bloody rum, got me lookin at ceilings

Twenty white guns salute with hounds doggs on my trail
Got me, face down in the mud and shit

Master P talking:

But I'm a dog so fuck em all bitch I keep on bailin'
Sellin' millions at a time, blazin' up thembackwoods

Niggas wanna kill me, but if they knew me I don't really think
They wanna do nothin' to me nigga

Chorus 2x

(Full Blooded)
I flash the tank when dem niggas don't know

And when we gone dog fuck em all dog!

(Wake the fuck up)

[Verse 1]
Y'all can't compare me with no nigga you know
[?] hit the floor when you hear my flow, woe
It's not the realest shit I ever wrote
That [?] I ever smoke around niggas, that's cut throat
Gotta be on my P's and Q's cause niggas hatin'
Niggas that I used to fuck with, don't wanna see me make it
Rapping is my occupation, respect that
I left the game where it's at but if I want to, I can go back
But no, I can't be around no dope
Flashbacks to bad habits doing bad and selling soap
Bricks all in my throat, caked that coke up my nose
When I can make money, fuck hoes just by getting a couple of blows
And stay in condos and slam luxury doors
Everything got [?] and paid for
Won't have it no other way, another day another baller
Shot caller, big pistol [?] with back against the wall
Shit, [?] put that all up on [?] daughter
Fuck with this No Limit shit, you put me off in that water
Shit, I used to snort a quarter, but now I only smoke blunts
Cause I get on that other level and don't know my do's and dont's
Shit's getting real

[Hook]
Shit's getting real, you better guard your grill
Cause if you fake, you can't feel we real
Shit's getting real
Shit's getting real, you better guard your grill
Cause if you fake, you can't feel we real
Shit's getting real
Shit's getting real, you better guard your grill
Cause if you fake, you can't feel we real
Shit's getting real
Shit's getting real, you better guard your grill
Cause real niggas, can feel what we feel
Shit's getting real

[Verse 2: Fiend]
[?]
I'm known as dangerous so Fiend became a name for this
[?] for this, so I can get the change for this
[?] executive [?]
I got a little something put you on the map
From the attack, villains stacking
[?]
Remove the keys of the night
[?]
Had weed on that pipe instead of that white with a fight
Now you're dealing with my dog that don't bark when they bite
[?] get it right
And remember, it ain't personal
And every single sick [?] believe me was rehearsable
Out [?]
[?] better put some dirt in you
Hoping that [?] walk in with the chills
Get the money and [?]
Trying to get paid for a kill
Releasing these really reals
Fiend and [?], No Limits navy seal

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

The battles begun heavy kissing on the front line
Strategic and bout it to explode like a land mine
So you wanna go to war huh
You brought the camoflauge panties and maching bra to get down huh
Big Ed's a soldier and your a soldierette
Nuclear warhead in the trenches watch to get you hot and wet
Bet that a war would last as long as Vietnam
Bet that when you cum it will drop like atomic bombs
Bet that I pack a 50 cal. desert eagle
That will leave you shaking in the trenches here comes the sequel
Wondering what the gats and the blitz
Your grenade exploded so many times that you can't believe this
She look at me she swolled 220 and sewed up

And a t-shirt go to hell with blood stain
And this TRU so too busy out for your loot
Enough surrounded by the stresses in black suits
Your girl polishes your shoes

The nigga died when you passed through
A half played the funeral around the clock

I'm gonna hustle till I'm dead and gone nigga
Don't never let up, don't never let up, you heard me?

Chorus: (x2)
I'm hustle till I'm dead and gone
I got my mind on my money and my hand on my 9 nigga

C-Murder:
I went from selling coke to selling tapes in stores
I'm stealing Monte Carlos, driving out show room floors
Now uh, I've been a thug since I was born
I used to hide on the step when my pops cut up heron
A lower class motherfucker never had nothing
I watched my brother kill a man and never say nothing
I walk with eyes on the back of my head
Cause in the projects a lot of young niggas wind up dead
I only roll with TRU niggas and G's
Like Big Ed and Snoop, I want to kill all my enemies
Now why the Fed's analyzing my words
Since my last court release I ain't never touch another bird
I tell a judge, fuck a violation
I ain't got ten years, nigga I'm trying to rock a whole world
I want to be like P and Bone nigga
Cause I'm gonna hustle until I'm dead and gone nigga

Chorus x2

Big Ed:
The early 90's standing on the block slangin' them rocks
A little bad ass nigga running from the cops
We used to drive our Z's to the jungle, fun as ever
My neighborhood trained me to be a killer
Big nigga, maintained in the dope game
Slangin bundles of weed, heron, and cocaine
The game is in my vain, you can't stop me nigga
Over time I got hypnotized by pulling triggers
Dying to be the big wheeler, cat peeler, big rap star
They had the finest hoes, clothes, and fastest cars
Me, Silkk, P, and C been hustling for years
Binded by blood and tattoo tears
Rap game gon' never change, my hustle ready to tussle
You talk too much shit, we slapping niggas with mussels
Tank use it's muscle, so can't stop the tidal wave
Hit the Billboard, y'all can sweat, rain

Chorus x2

Full Blooded:
My niggas trying to maintain in the streets
My bloodline hounding on all four, trying to get up on the seat
Fuck a police sweating a nigga trying to shut down a call
But it's my hounds turn to ball
We hit the streets with them choppers and the fash
Hound out a finch, took them knees with a pocket full of cash
Got the do's in the dash ???
Fuck it, get a new one, live for cash
Better yet, let em die whole blooded
He that cat that the third block flocking fifteen hundred
All my soldiers and my hounds start counting potatoes
From the thought of big Q all down ???
These demons done counted them out
And this motherfucking game try to hit, fly out like a falcon

Chorus x4[Mr. Serv-On talking]
Yo Mean Green this Serv-On, Full Blooded we gonna do this for ya baby
But um we ain't feelin' too good today, thess niggas don't unserstand
Are life, It ain't like a nigga trippin' on them out dere but dam you
Know it seems like I got more friends now then I had when I was
Strugglin' you know what I'm sayin', so won't you feel this

[Mr. Serv-On]
In tha beginning when there weas no money spendin'
It seems a lot of niggas thought I was pretendin'
But now I'm sendin' plaques to my momma wall
And it seems like alotta hoes that didn't notice a nigga
Back then they startin' ta fall
An alotta niggas that wouldn't even talk to me, startin' ta call
But all in all nigga we gonna ball
But as for right now I gotta unborn child to feed
You know money brang greed
Tha same greed tha shook a niggas thru his adolesent years
You couldn't understand tha shit that use to brang me to tears
Just to know my cousin Randall dead
It makes me sometimes don't even want to get outta bed
But I know cowards hand fed, but alotta real niggas die young
That's why I pray to god don't let me have a son
Cause I don't want him to go thru tha pressures that I went thru
Not tryna be a man, but tryna wonder will I die red or blue
Cause it seems like tha world turns its back on poor mothers & bangers
Momma told my sister never to talk to strangers
Now she 8 months holdin' a life & I don't wanna take a wife
Cause I see myself murdered at night
Nigga feel that, I stay strapped

[Chorus:Serv-On]
How could you niggas say you got luv for me
You never felt what I felt would you die wit me(4X)

[Full Blooded]
Where my niggas at, like bitches, they done scattered out
Was all about when tha riches was passed out
I showed luv a nigga played me close
Played a nigga from a distance when I copped my joece
How could you nigga just pretend like dat
You'll be down wit a nigga til' tha end like dat
I cocked gauges tryna save yo ass
I bustin' glass, hittin' gas, while continuin' to blast
Now I'm holdin' up a bottle
Gettin' blunted, I'm livin' up to our motto
I'm spreadin' hollow point tips
Pullin' stunts half tha bottle
You know tha swap were niggas let 'em rip
I'm frustrated to tha fullest, got me sweatin' bullets
I'm double clipped, ski mask, & I'm hooded
Releasin' anger in tha heat of tha night
Tha Long Ranger masked man, I copped media hype
From one house to tha next house
I showed you mothafuckas love & you showed me doubts
So while you out dere profilin' for them bitches
Fuckin' Hounds, spendin' days lyin' up in ditches
I'm lookin' thru tha scope of a car beam
Gettin' blunted blowin' smoke up my nose finna shatter your dreams nigga
Now that's luv

Chorus(4X)

[Mr. Serv-On talking]
You niggas don't understand tha word betrayal, that's tha essence of a
Downfall to a real nigga, you niggas walk up an say you got luv 4 me
You'll give me you bitch, your life but you don't really mean dat
Me & Full Blooded than felt tha betrayal of niggas we thought had luv
That's why it's hard for a nigga to accept one of you niggas like dat
You know this goes out to all of my niggas tryna come up, thank about
What you doin' out dere, my lil' nigga Craig from 7 figures watch
Yourself baby cause when you start makin' it you'll have more friends
In tha end then you had in tha beginning, yo Full you got somethin' to
Say nigga, let these niggas know

[Full Blooded talking]
It's like this here Serv, If you niggas ain't keepin' it real another
Dog gonna hitcha, if you ain't sharin' tha food wit tha blood line dawg
It's like this here, you ain't gonna last long, so all you fools talkin'
Bout you got luv 4 me, I don't feel it, i ain't feelin' it, I just don't
Feel itChorus: x2
(Soulja Slim)Me and My cousin we stay bustin
Head busters off top
(Full Blooded)It ain't no thang to let 'em hang
And watch them pistols go pop

(Soulja Slim)
If it ain't no thang to let 'em hang then watch these pistols pop
Then it ain't no thang to let 'em hang and see a nigga drop
My pistol cocked
And it stays like that
Me and my cousin we keep our A-k's like that
Bout that combat way before I singed with No Limit

Use to jack it if I was sober
Get it how I live
Now picture me takin over

And give it to you raw as I could
Take it how you wanna
As long as the shit understood
Smokin on backwoods
Filled with some shit we got from L.A
My cousin told me

Okay so I pack my bags and get ready for the trip
You know I'm a redrummer so I stash 4 clips

Well get with it shit's real
Fuckin world is like a movie
One minute I'm waking every nigga

Some nigga lookin for my cousin heard he ask about me
Why this shit has to be
Is what my girl keep asking me

So we lay camouflage behind dark tent
Got enough shit to leave all 4 corners bent

Cut throats to the fullest, keep a niggas hemp out
Toe to toe we make noise, action packed we slang boys
Trenitty flexing real shits
Cut throat committed hurry hurry and we in this bitch

Chorus x2

[The Gambino Family]
I'll be the nigga that they call Feano
And I roll with a click called Gambinos
Knows in the shoulders who the fuck we be
Worldwide motherfuckers out that 1-2-3
Started off as a youngster kickin up dust
Until I slain motherfuckers who be ready to bust
Give a fuck

[Lil Gotti Gambino]
Gotti be the title that I hold for sure
Pokin hoes after shows with my nigga Feano
Hit the scheme for your cream if you know what I mean
Triple beam when I'm in it fourteen
Niggas telling me to keep it at ease, but they ain't feeling me
Studio B's if you pull em at ease, from New Orleans to ?????


[Big Ed]
Big Ed attacking, bred a No Limit soldier
Gettin bad with me, I screw your head off your shoulders
I'm rollin with killers, thug niggas and convicts
But I love the way you lick your lips
The way you bounce that ass baby gets me kind of hot
Goin out with me, ten out of nine cherries pops

(Uhhhhhhh)
Chorus

[Prime Suspects]
P threw a party down in New Orleans
Hoes pop pussies, fuck, you know what that means
Jump in the cut roll a fat one up
Fire it up, better love cause a soldier dont stut, yeah

I gotta pound of rocks so it's on and poppin
The party ain't stoppin so don't leave for cops
I drink toxic, from the brow I'm been, G
Weed and hennesy, that shit was meant for me

Yeah, yeah, niggas fall straight through the door (through the door)
Soldiers greet soldiers hollerin bout why (why, why)
Why let em roam (let em roam)
Type of niggas make history, and yeah what (yeah what)
Really don't give a fuck

[Mac]
This a No Limit party, who got the blunts and the forties
Woah!  Motherfucker it's me, the M-A-C (who)
You know my steed when I enter
I'm lookin for a bitch bout cold as the winter
Is it cool to fuck, I'm tryin to do somethin, run through somethin
Cause the spin in the change about nothin
You know my name, know what's tap
You know I rap, I'm a motherfucking mack
Baby girl and it's like that, it's a No Limit party

Chorus x2

[Kane & Abel]
My nigga Snoop brought the weed, Slim brought the liquor
C brought the cash and I brought the stripper
Freak ho shake that ass while niggas tip her
Got a pocket full of rubbers so we all goin hit her
Bitch cleaner then Mr. Clean, a nigga decked out
Eyes hella red, Kane and Abel sessed out
Respect the tank, nigga stick my chest out
And this how we do it in the dirty south

[Magic]
Woah, please somebody tell me where the party at
I'm tired of holding back, I wanna shine in my cadillac
I'm here representing a soldier named Slim
See the tank on this neck, see the ice on this wrist
Picture this, I'm riding with Snoop Doggy Dogg
And so yall don't worry bout the corners, we smokin till the morning
Yall just keep the bitches, now we on the way
Hold on man I think Snoop got somethin to say

[Snoop Dogg]
Think fast when you dunk, cause I won't front
And when it's time to dunk I won't be no punk
I'll just pick the heater up and bust a shot
I'm the last nigga up to rock the spot
I'm represent a nigga to the fullest cause
And if yall wanna trip, we tear this club up (tear it up)
Huh bro, nigga nigga what, I'm tryin to bust again
I'm likin likin, I want some real pimp shit
Mo B. D. feel me niggas out the sess
Drink for drink and think to put in the fitty
Will he be that same nigga blowin doshia (say what)
Check this out, get the fuck out, party overChorus: X2
Tell me what you're lookin' for, what you want?
Look inside my trunk you can find what you want

[Kane]
1008 grams in the trunk, that's a Kilo for you punks
Kane and Abel in this bitch, gettin' rich as Trump
Blowin' skunk on the I-10 to New Orleans from Houston
Alsmost home, hit Gotti on the cell phone
Get some B12, get out some pots
When I get there we gonna cook and chop these rocks
It's a never ending game, and my hustle don't stop
It's a devestating pain when I use my Glock

[Abel]
Chrome duce dutton and a chrome 600
High as the fuck, but we can still get blunted
TRU niggas don't talk, ya yap, ya get punished
A hundred G's cash in the stash (all hundreds)
Nigga bout to wreck shop
Post it up, on the high block, rocks and my polo socks
Just a young nigga hustle out the trunk for dough
Got the chip, flip phones by the corner store

Chorus X2

[Gotti]
I got the properest product
From the weed to the board to the pluck
Some chip phones to 6 shot chromes, so whats up?
Step in the cut
Don't let them feds no what's happenin' with us
Because they love to bust a nigga nuts
And have me hard to wear some handcuffs
So I keepin' my eyes open and my mouth shut
I only fuck with my gambino's
Cause everything that I do is illegal
From racketeering to casinos to choppin' weight
With my nigga Fino, me, Hound, and Kane and Abel
On a highway, cell phones on hopin' the feds ain't listenin' on three way
They tap our frequency
So we got to watch what we say, from New Orleans to L.A
We got money to make, Gotti, I play for high stakes
No mistakes involved, cause it could cause us to fall
Snitch nigga, catchin' slugs, ain't no love from us thug
Told me guns, or blood
So nigga what?
Keep that shit on the hush

[Full Blooded]
And step to the breeze way
Niggas with me to take it easy
I won't, but I can't face death when you squeeze me
Put the automatic Glock, up inside the clutched fist of a mask man
Ski mask man, yeah man, doin' bad man, cash man
I'm hound out, play my hood, hit blasa
Pass the herb, hit the curb, and I, leave 'em tied up in knots
First night murder, that's how we do it, thats how we did it
Who did it?
You know your boy, ? that run with No Limit
It was in some, white camaro, fuckin' window was tinted
They had noise in it, they had P boys in it, they had toys in it
Full Blooded
Niggas gonna respect that there
I'm a No Limit soldier
I can't neglect that there
Give 'em camoflague on my duty
Hand me the keys to the dooley
Give me a bullet proof, 2 PK's, when these niggas wanna do me
About this here, head bustin', throat cuttin'
Finger funk type shit, give a fuck nigga, smoke somethin'

Chorus till fade
