[Intro]
This goes out to all the women in the world, especially her
You know it don't even matter your age; it don't even matter your color
Yo, fellas, I ain't forgettin' 'bout y'all
This is for everybody who like to dance
Just listen to what I'm sayin' and do it, and take a chance

[Refrain]
I put my hand upon your hip, when I dip, you dip, we dip
You put your hand upon my hip, when you dip, I dip, we dip
I put my hand upon your hip, when I dip, you dip, we dip
You put yours, and I put mine, and we can dip down low and roll and grind

[Verse 1]
Just get on the floor like I said befo'
Y'all remember that "Down Low"!
Just put a little dip wit' it
Now roll those hips wit' it
Pop it, push it, rock it, roll it
Can't control it? I'll come hold it
It's all in fun so take a chance
Just get on the floor and do that dance, y'all
I know you like this so, don't try to fight it
Turn around, baby, let me see you from the back
Yeah, I like it like that
Get up now, roll those hips
Drop down, double-up on those dips
Freak Nasty wanna see
Can y'all do this right here for me?

[Refrain]

[Verse 2]
Back again with the second verse
It's all clean, so I'm not gonna curse
Droppin' bass like a bad habit
Love all women, cause I gotta have it
Comin' at y'all in stereo
I'm ridin' that thing like a rodeo
Hang on, baby, cause the ride is rough, and ...
[Don't stop till you get enough] {OOH!}
I got my girls in the front
Now a lady just bumpin' that rump
Raise it up, let me see that brown
Slap it, girl, make it jiggle around
Round and round that rump goes
Where it stop, yo, no one knows, yeah
Freak Nasty wanna see
Can y'all do this right here for me?

[Refrain]

Well alright, y'all! If you ain't dippin', you must
Be trippin'! If you ain't doin it Down Low, you gots
To go! To the people thats movin' slow to the
Dance floor! Yo DJ! Pump it up some MO-O-O-O .....

[Verse 3]
It's off to the show in a limo
Before the show, I gotta get that dough
Pay them girls what they're worth
Slip that money under that skirt
Take it off, baby, let me see
You might get a lil' mo' lucci
G-string havin' oh so much fun
Playin' inside, between them buns
Shortie got it on like Marvin
Teasin' me and you know I'm starvin'
Lick you up, then lick you down
I ain't finished; girl, turn around
Lick you up and down your back
Cause I'm that freak, I'm freaky like that!
Freak Nasty wanna see
Can y'all do this right here for me?

[Refrain]

[Verse 4]
I'm settin' it off to another level
You're diggin' Freak Nasty without a shovel
This is my world; I'm just a squirrel
Tryin' to get a nut, so wassup
Yo, DJ, when the party's getting slow
Join this jam on and watch that floor
Get taken over like in '94
When I had the whole world gettin' Down Low
New Orleans born, ATL livin'
Freak Nasty's what I'm givin'
My juice is sweet like Georgia Peaches
Women suck it up like leeches
Uh-huh, if you're so good
You must admit you like this shhhhhhhhhh
Yeah, y'all know the song
So come on won't you sing it with me?

I can love you right, but not tonight
There's a time for love, but tonight is now
Whassup?  I wanna fuck!

Deep down south, we love to party
Dance floors packed, hoes shakin' they bodies
70's music still rulin' the disco
]From South Beach to San Francisco
A late night fever, a sex crazed land
Wild-ass hoes to the one night stand
Swettin' the freaks with the tightest skirts
Talk about they ride, a 60s 'Vert
Listenin' to oldies bumpin' the sounds
Forget that shit, buy the underground
Underground station that ain't legit
Playin' them cuss-words, dropping that shit
Party from the club, to the streets
Hangin' on cars, solicitin' freaks
It ain't over, it's time to play
Don't stress ya'll, let's par-tyyy!

When them hoes freak everybody
Them other girls just bore me
But the 2 Live girls make Me So Horny
I had a ho doin' S & M
Marquis had a ho doin' her and him
Chinaman had 'em gettin' down low

Chorus

Verse 3: Brother Marquis
What'll know 'bout havin' a party?
Fall up in the club, the envy of everybody
You make the money, so spend it
Baller parkin' Benz's lookin' like millions
I'm in the back of the club gettin' blessed g-fresh
Drinkin' n' smokin' the best, and nothin' less
Champagne poppin', chicken heads flockin'
The DJ's rockin', got the whole house hoppin'
Let's make this night one to remember
If you fuckin' with me, you're fuckin' with a real nigga
You can jump in the 'Vert, baby, and ride out
I'll have you suckin' me up at the hide-out
Tell a bitch quick, I ain't beggin' nor buyin'
Get the fuck up out my face, who the fuck you tryin'?

Live on the set of the Jerry Springer
I was glad to meet her 'till I shook her hand:
I found out your cousin was really a man!
Nigga named Tyrone givin' you the bone?
Fuck that shit, you shoulda' stayed at home
Told me on the phone, you and I were alone

You put yours, and I put mine, and we can dip down low and roll and grind

[Verse 1]
Just get on the floor like I said befo'
Y'all remember that "Down Low"!
Just put a little dip wit' it
Now roll those hips wit' it
Pop it, push it, rock it, roll it
Can't control it? I'll come hold it
It's all in fun so take a chance
Just get on the floor and do that dance, y'all
I know you like this so, don't try to fight it
Turn around, baby, let me see you from the back

Get up now, roll those hips
Drop down, double-up on those dips
Freak Nasty wanna see
Can y'all do this right here for me?

Hang on, baby, cause the ride is rough, and ...
[Don't stop till you get enough] {OOH!}

To go! To the people thats movin' slow to the
Dance floor! Yo DJ! Pump it up some MO-O-O-O .....

[Verse 3]
It's off to the show in a limo
Before the show, I gotta get that dough
Pay them girls what they're worth
Slip that money under that skirt
Take it off, baby, let me see
You might get a lil' mo' lucci
G-string havin' oh so much fun
Playin' inside, between them buns
Shortie got it on like Marvin
Teasin' me and you know I'm starvin'
Lick you up, then lick you down

Lick you up and down your back
Cause I'm that freak, I'm freaky like that!
Freak Nasty wanna see
Can y'all do this right here for me?

This is my world; I'm just a squirrel
Tryin' to get a nut, so wassup
Yo, DJ, when the party's getting slow
Join this jam on and watch that floor
Get taken over like in '94
When I had the whole world gettin' Down Low
New Orleans born, ATL livin'
Freak Nasty's what I'm givin'
My juice is sweet like Georgia Peaches
Women suck it up like leeches
Uh-huh, if you're so good
You must admit you like this shhhhhhhhhh
Yeah, y'all know the song
So come on won't you sing it with me?

Ourto (repeated till fade)
I put my hand upon your hip
When I dip you dip we dip
You put your hand upon my hip
When you dip I dip we dipINTERVIEWER: Why do you use profanity so much?
MAN: Because that's my right if I want to.  I'm grown, and I can
Curse whenever I want to
INTERVIEWER: All right, fine
MAN: Thank you. (to himself) Shit

Women walkin' in and out, g-string down
I was in a pool, chillin', layin' these fuckin' lyrics down
It's all about havin' fun and lettin' down your hair
Bring your mama, bring your sister, bring your auntie; I don't care

Now if, she's fuckin', you best to keep on truckin'
If you playa hate, you need to find another date
Or come join in, or stay standing at the gate
You knew she was a freak, that's why you got with her ass
If you thought you wasn't gettin' none you woulda let it pass
All I'm doin', player, is speakin' the truth
So don't get mad at me if somebody else is knockin' the boots!

I didn't create this game; all I did was join the team
But comin' to one of my parties is the American dream
We got them hoes on niggas, them niggas on them hoes
Them hoes on them hoes cause everything goes
They buy, they try anything here
Come here, baby, let me whisper in your ear
You don't have to do nothin' that you don't wanna do

Verse 1:
Straight up, girl, I wanna fuck
Yo' fine ass in the buck
We can do what comes to mind
We can do it fast or take our time
We can do it any way you like
As long as we fuck tonight
Love, there's a time for it
But look, tonight I wanna fuck!
In that ass I wanna get, deep
Like Jacques Cousteau in that C, U-T, U-P
Freak Nasty, hittin' that sweet pussy
Don't front cause I ain't fakin'
Let's get together and make bakin'
There's a time for love, but tonight is now
Whassup?  I wanna fuck!

Chorus

Verse 2:
Fuckin' is good when you're fuckin' right
Freak Nasty fuck all night

I guarantee you won't regret it
Jus' gimme a chance and let me get it
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, nut!  Girl, I wanna fuck!
My dick is hard, so what you gon' do?
If you don't know, here's a clue:
Fuckin', suckin', you know you want it
You wouldn't be in the club flauntin' it
So stop puttin' on and cut to the chase
Lemme see how it taste!
There's a time for love, but tonight is now
Whassup?  I wanna fuck!

Chorus

Verse 3:
I ain't playin', girl, I'm for real
You ain't dumb, you know the deal
Y'all do the same all the time
If you say you don't, stop lyin'!
O-R-G-I-E, Freak Nasty, can't you see
I'm all about sex, triple-X-rated, as I stated
I don't mind lickin' toes
If you do me too, that's how it goes
You got knees, I got knees, girl;
I don't mind sayin' please!  I can love you long
I can love you right, but not tonight
There's a time for love, but tonight is now
Whassup?  I wanna fuck!

ChorusSee, when I do these tracks ... I like to see y'all move.  That's why
I do 'em.  To make you move, nod your head or somethin'.  You know
It doesn't matter how you do it.  You know, see, when I do these
Tracks, I wanna see you move.  I wanna see you nod yo' head, get
On the floor, or do somethin', you know what I'm talkin' 'bout, ya
Heard me?

A-push 'em up, baby, a-push 'em up, c'mon (4x)

Verse 1
Now I'm steppin' out the woodwork, you know it should work
Makin' people dance to the jams, but it could hurt
When the sound hit loud, y'know how it sound
When the vibes slide through your hide, it's hard to sit down
]From the club to your ride, inside or outside
I'm changin' up the game since the moment I arrived
I'm sellin' at arenas with funk, like Cold Medina
And girl, it's guaranteed for all you seqoritas
I'm knockin' mamasitas from east to west coast
I'm knockin' in your speakers a lot more than most
Have 'em meltin' like butter on your breakfast toast
And at the end of the night, they givin' up the ghost
New Orleans born, but now I'm in the ATL
You can tell that we sell just ahead on the 12
To the 9-9-9-dot-9-88
Platinum plus, baby, don't playa hate, push 'em up

Chorus (4x)
Jam-jiggy-jam-jiggy-jam, c'mon!
Everybody get 'em up, push 'em up, c'mon!

Verse 2
I'm takin' over the world without even tryin'
I fly in first class, recline while sippin' wine
And baby, I ain't lyin' when I announce I'm retirin'
And women all over will stop and start cryin'
I'm down to make hits for years to come
And get you all alone with the flip of my tongue
Have you hung over with the ruch of the cum
And leave your body numb after givin' you some
If you're fine to me, then I'm fine to you too
If you hatin' on me, I'm still fine to you
But why you playa hatin' on shit I create?
You can't participate; if not, then motivate
That's why the hatin' niggas bring you down
You sell more than them, the bustas want to clown
Don't mean-mug me while I'm wishin' you luck
While you stuck on hatin' I'm still pushin' 'em up, c'mon ...

Chorus

Verse 3
Freak Nasty's the one gettin' 99%
Hangin' out with all the fly girls and gents
Havin' freaky parties in my house or my pent
Love's in the air, you can tell by the scent
My Porsche and my 'Vette get pushed in AM
And in the PM I rolls the BM
So black, do you know where Hard Hood is at?
It's stacked on my wall in platinum plaques
In a club, big baller, young shot caller
And a lot of playa haters would love to see me fall
And flap, right of the face of the earth
I'm takin' over turf for all that it's worth
When I surf the nation, it's history in the makin'
I'm always real, I never come fakin'
The south is blowin' up like centinnial park
Cause I be gettin' where you in, so don't leave a star, c'mon ...

Chorus
