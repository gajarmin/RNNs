Natalie La Rose

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I wanna rock with somebody
I wanna take shots with somebody
I wanna leave with somebody
And we ain't gonna tell nobody, we ain't gonna tell nobody

[Verse 1: Natalie La Rose]
Walk in, everybody knows what's good
But some gonna hate, what's new?
We just do our thing, no time to waste
Always play it cool

[Pre-Chorus: Natalie La Rose (Jeremih)]
And at the end of the night when the lights go out
Will we turn down? Oh no we won't
(We ain't never turnin' down, we ain't never turnin' down)
And when they try to make us leave
We turn and say we never going home
(And you know just what I wanna do)

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I wanna rock with somebody
I wanna take shots with somebody
I wanna leave with somebody
And we ain't gotta tell nobody, we ain't gotta tell nobody

Walk in, everybody know what's good
We're our only plug
Bring us everything we think we need
Tonight is goin' up
Tonight is goin' up

[Pre-Chorus: Natalie La Rose (Jeremih)]
And at the end of the night when the lights go out
Will we turn down? Oh no we won't
(We ain't never turnin' down, we ain't never turnin' down)
And when they try to make us leave
We turn and say we never going home
(And you know just what I wanna do)

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I wanna rock with somebody
I wanna take shots with somebody
I wanna leave with somebody
And we ain't gotta tell nobody, we ain't gotta tell nobody

[Pre-Chorus: Natalie La Rose (Jeremih)]
And at the end of the night when the lights go out

And when they try to make us leave
We turn and say we never going home
(And you know just what I wanna do)

I know what you came here to see

And I know what you came here to do
Now bust it open let me see you get loose
It's going down for real (x3)

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
Your girl just kissed a girl
I do bi chicks
Shake for a sheik, I'm throwing these Emirates in the sky
Spending this As-salamu alaykum, peace to M.O.N.E.Y
I love my beaches, south beaches, surfboard in high tide
I could just roll up cause I'm swoll up
So that birthday cake get the cobra
Bugatti for real, I'm cold bruh
That auto-biography rover
Got the key to my city it's over
It's no thots, only Anna Kournikova's
I set records, ratchets hold up
(I set records, ratchets hold up)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Sage the Gemini]
And they already know me
It's going down further than femurs
Girls get wetter than Katrina
Yeah my girl you never seen her
Cause my tints by limousines
My touch say it's the Midas
We the plus your man a minus
My team blowing on that slam
Make you cough-cough that's Bronchitis
Put your hands up
It's a stick up, no more makeup
Get that ass on the floor
Ladies put your lipstick up
Double entendre, double entendre
While you're hating I get money
Then I double up tonkers

[Hook]

[Bridge: Flo Rida]
Lift it, drop it, shake it, pop it
Lift it, drop it, shake it, pop it

All right, all right

[Pre-Chorus 1: Flo Rida]
I don't like it, I love it
I got another comin' in my budget
I got a anaconda in my truck fit
Don't push it, don't push it
Cause I'ma hit it til I jackpot, that's right
Wax on baby wax off, act right
You can put it on the black card, all night
And I'll spend it, I'll spend it cause

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
All night, let me group ya
Dance with me, turn down for who girl

Yeah party all night, let's all aboard
Let's all aboard, all aboard

[Pre-Chorus 2: Flo Rida]
I don't like it, I love it
And them other girl they can't touch it
Competition, that's a whole nother subject

To the mansion or the condo, let's go
Perfect time gotta let it flow, you know
I'm watching, I'm watching, cause

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Flo Rida]
Meet me at the studio
Bangarang just like Ruffio
Feel the base, let ya booty go

Run away for a few days
Thinkin' bout love, baby touche
Tied up like a shoe lace
I don't like it, I don't like it

[Chorus - Part][Intro]
Open up the champagne, pop!
It's my house, come on, turn it up

Hear a knock on the door and the night begins
Cause we done this before so you come on in

Pour yourself something cold, baby, cheers to this

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes you gotta stay in
And you know where I live
Yeah, you know what we is

[Chorus]
Welcome to my house
Baby take control now

Show me what you do now
We don't have to go out
Welcome to my house
Welcome to my house

[Verse 2]
Morning comes and you know that you wanna stay
Close the blinds, let's pretend that the time has changed
Keep our clothes on the floor, open up champagne
Let's continue tonight, come on, celebrate

[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Welcome to my [?]. the crib, the spot, the pad
But my house is your house if you throwin' it back
Excuse me if my home [?]
Soon as these happy faces [?] you can run with the cash
Homerun, slam dunk, touchdown, pass
Mi casa es tu casa so it ain't no holding back
Another shot of vodka, you know what's in my glass
It's my house, just relax

[Chorus]

Welcome to my house
It's my house[Hook]
Can you blow my whistle, baby
Whistle, baby, let me know
Girl I'm gonna show you how to do it
And we start real slow
You just put your lips together
And you come real close
Can you blow my whistle baby, whistle baby
Here we go

[Whistling]

[Verse 1]
I'm betting you like people
And I'm betting you love freak mode
And I'm betting you like girls that give love to girls
And stroke your little ego
I bet I'm guilty your honor
But that's how we live in my genre
Who in hell done paved the road wider
There's only one flo, and one rida
I'm a damn shame
Order more champagne, pull a damn hamstring
Tryna put it on ya
Bet your lips spin back around corner
Slow it down baby take a little longer

[Hook + Whistling]

[Refrain]
Whistle baby, whistle baby (x4)

[Verse 2]
It's like everywhere I go, my whistle ready to blow
Shorty don't even know, she can get any by the low
Told me she's not a pro, it's okay, it's under control
Show me soprano, cause girl you can handle
Baby we start snagging, you come up in part clothes
Girl I'm losing wing, my Bugatti the same road
Show me your perfect pitch, you got it my banjo
Talented with your lips like you blew out a candle
So amusing
Now you can make a whistle with the music
Hope you ain't got no issue, you can do it
Give me the perfect pitch, you never lose it

[Hook] + [Whistling] + [Refrain]

[Verse 3]
Go girl you can work it
Let me see your whistle while you work it
I'mma lay it back, don't stop it
Cause I love it how you drop it, drop it, drop it, on me
Now, shorty let that whistle blow
Yeah, baby let that whistle blow

[Hook] + [Whistling] + [Refrain][Verse 1: Jeremih]
Wasn't looking for it to heal the scar
But today I was riding on lonely boulevard
Wishing all wasn't lost and then there, there you came
Honestly a star shooting through the scene
In the sky, that's where we are, and I'm tryna catch a beam
See them other girls, yeah they try, but they ain't fly like you

[Hook]
Tonight belongs to you
Tonight belongs to you
And I'm so glad I found you
I'm so glad I found you

[Verse 2: Jeremih]
You're all by yourself and I came to help
I was down, it wasn't right, you came from outta left
You made a storm up in Ibiza, oh, oh what a dream
I close my eyes baby, now I don't wanna go
I'mma star, cause if I'm dreaming I don't wanna wake up
Gotta hear it from the [?] speak right with you

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Flo Rida]
Flo Rida, ayo Jeremih, lemme holla at lil mama right quick

I know who you are, you're a rider, girl on fire, ghetto superstar
And I can't deny it, girl your body's so damn beautiful
Let me see you turn around like ay, baby go on drop it to the ground like ay
Red lips, yellow bone green like ay, eyes popping baby 'til I beat the thing right
Oh now, feeling like y'all finally found out, what what what what, slow down
Pull the trigger too fast and I'll bust my gun gun gun gun, no conversation
Don't stop with all the shaking, them other girls really basic
You amazing, so glad I got you girl

[Hook]
And I'm so glad I found you

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]

So sexual, she was flex-able
Professional, drinkin X and oh
Hold up, wait a minute, do I see
What I think I - whoa
Did I thank I see shawty get low
Ain't the same when it's up that close
Make it rain, I'm makin it snow
Work the pole, I got the bank roll
I'mma say that I prefer them no clothes
I'm into that, I love women exposed
She threw it back at me, I gave her mo'
Cash ain't no problem, I know where it goes
She had them...

[Hook: T-Pain]

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
Heeey, shawty what I gotta do to get you home?
My jeans full of guap and the ready for shones
Cadillacs, Maybachs for the sexy grown
Patron on the rocks that'll make you moan
One stack - c'mon, two stacks - c'mon
Three stacks - c'mon, now that's three grand
What, you think I'm playin, baby girl?
I'm the man, I'll bend the rubber bands"
That's what I told her, her legs on my shoulder
I knew it was over, that Henny and Cola
Got me like a solider, she ready for Rover
I couldn't control her, so lucky oh me
I was just like a clo-ver
Shawty was hot like a toast-er
Sorry but I had to fold, her
Like a pornography pos-ter, she showed her...

[Hook: T-Pain]

[Verse 3: Flo Rida]
Whooooa, (shaw-taaay), yeah she was worth the (mon-eyyy)
Lil' mama took my (caaaash), and I ain't want it (baaaack)
The way she bent that (baaaack), got her them paper (staaaacks)
Tattoo above her (craaaack), I had to handle (thaaaat)
I was on it, sexy woman
Let me showin and made me want it
Two in the mornin, I'm zonin
And them Rosay bottles foamin
She wouldn't stop, made it drop
Shawty did that pop and lock
Had to break her off that guap
Gal was fly just like my Glock

The Benz with the windows tinted, go on, lock it, dirty south

Got me achy, call me papi, hot as saki, fly as feathers

Deserve a encore, the definition of a show

[Verse 2]

Hey, I'm feeling you girl, wanna get close to you, no doubt
My s-s-swagger should tell it more than anything can vouch
Little mama you are what's happening, ghetto fine, I'll make you proud

Miss Thang, million dollar game, Coke bottle frame
Make my wall of fame, let me know your name, I control the rain

Stormy weather with this cheddar all because you hot as ever
If you may lady, let me play baby, make my way baby

Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce

[Hook 1: Yung Joc]
I'm in the club
Kush got it burning up
I'm poppin' bottles and I'm fucking up their furniture
I'm in the club, DJ gon' turn it up
Got a flock of models and we fucking up their furniture

[Hook 2: Yung Joc]
All my niggas gettin money
Don't know how to act (x3)
Dirty goons and we stuntin
Don't know how to act (x3)

Don't know how to act (x3)
Yeah my pockets on swoll
Don't know how to act (x3)

[Flo Rida]
Hey, wipin' my pumps, poppin' that Dom, pardon melange
Show stoppin', no flockin', I'm about to perform
Wife beater on, VIP, like the eye of the storm
I'm project, I'm ghetto, hood, better ring the alarm
Cold flu, cause I just blew 30 off cash
Blue with my swag, that's that Gucci duffle bag
Goops coming through I got sparklers on the mag
Flo Rida act a fool, have a furniture attack
Well cause I'm young gettin' money, homeboy in Phantoms and Lac's
I'm in the club with my King Johnny's them diamonds is black
Shorty she lovin' my tattoos ingrained on my back
Muggin' and thuggin' the trap crew we step like Da Brat
Married the rubberbands, hustlin', hustlin'
Got a squad gutter man, so we musclin', musclin'
Security guard, touch the clan, then we, tusslin', tusslin'
Tear apart, hit the fan, now they runnin' and duckin'

[Hook 1 + 2]

[Flo Rida]
Hey, 20 bottles or better
I'm comin' in the club and I'm standin' on ya on the tootise leather
I gotta be fly, Kid Rock-in that derby with the feather
That good in the sky, got the kush from Cali control the weather
So hood, so hot, so what? Security wanna ban my record
Some fools on this ?? open up on the Oprah Winfrey show is no pressure
My crew full of dubs and we stunt like dollaz come with propellars
Everybody gotta grub in my pockets, gettin' paper is pleasure
Homie don't you f'n with heffers that square me up like checkers
And I might undress her all just because my diamonds caress her
Meet uncle fester, ballin', my shawties they hot as peppers
Don't know how to act I got stack full of mice looking for cheddar
Down for whatever, hey!
I'm a donut nigga like glazed
On a couch like this my stage
Get money, don't get a nigga paid in Dade...
They probably see minimum wage
My deal is Ace of Spades, but I still like grape Kool-aid
I ain't really got minutes, I party just like a rave!

[Hook 1 + 2]

[Hook 1][Hook: Flo Rida]
Can you blow my whistle baby, whistle baby
Let me know
Girl I'm gonna show you how to do it
And we start real slow
You just put your lips together
And you come real close
Can you blow my whistle baby, whistle baby

[Verse: RaC]
You’re a nice girl, who rocks mean shades
Can rock a nice fitted, you don't need no J'z
You’re all into school, you don't need to get paid
But you can jump in a pool, anytime, anyplace
Damn, I think I died cuz your looks kill
Some sixth sense shit, you can call me Bruce Will
Is it your mean demeanor, behind your back they be betting quarter mils
The game’s dirty, but your kicks stay cleaner still
You dropping dimes on that football field
You be killing it, girl you're just too real
You cheering for them Greens, wearing Chloe Jade Greens
Oh you fancy, huh?
Well stay fancy, then
You want them Valentino dresses even though
We know, that you are looking at your bestest
At all times, even when your hair is all messed up
But you don't seem to care and that just make me want to bless up
And I’m not asking but

[Hook: Flo Rida]
Can you blow my whistle baby, whistle baby
(I didn't want to use this instrumental, but it fit well)
Let me know
Girl I'm gonna show you how to do it
And we start real slow
You just put your lips together
And you come real close
Can you blow my whistle baby, whistle baby
Here we go

[Outro: RaC]
(I actually can't whistle)
Just a little fun
I should be studying for exams, but oh well
Make a track you know
And you know who this dedicated to
Not the chorus though
Alright, RaC[Intro - Timbaland]

Wear them apple bottoms, wear them apple bottoms honey

Louis bag kit, Gucci, Fendi and Armani
See the karats on her wrist, now she pimp Bugs Bunny
Used to date Kanye, now she want me
And while I got the juice, wanna take my OJ
It ain't her birthday but her name on the cake
If I ever pay for nookie grade A

[Hook]

[Flo Rida]
Heyyy, my third flo' stuck on the hoodrat gone
Cut tanktop, Hollyhood act wrong
Short tennis skirt, now she got me in the zone
Tattoo tight work, bump the "Low" ringtone
Bend the ghetto booty, bend the ghetto booty on her
Roll up with kitties, don't smoke Arizona
One night stand, one night with the clan
One night, one time broke her off ten grand
Project all the way, gutter all day
Pure uncut, stain wall with a J
Shorty don't fake, she'll put it in your face
Three stories while them hoodrats bass

Hard to follow my dreams workin this 9 to 5
People keep tellin me my check is on the way
So sun up to sundown I'm grindin, tryin to make it by
Prayin for my shift to come and take away the pain
That day is finally here [x3]
New shoes, new clothes, new whip, new chain
New wrist, knew that, knew this, finally here
That day is finally here [x2]
New shoes, new clothes, new whip, new chain
New wrist, knew that, knew this

[Verse 1]
No, no I won't settle for nothing less than the air that I breathe
I-I-I know it's a struggle, but who the hell g'on do it for me
Who the hell g'on do it free
If I don't get up and bust my ass, that's my motto
I can't put my faith in the lotto, luck don't stay nowhere near where I go
Unless you ride that muthafucka
And you be lucky enough to get away, in the grave
What can I do, what can I say, I tried to get paid
But I got grazed, the bullet went through
But I ain't get paid
Now what do I appreciate? My J-O-B
Hey boss, I'm comin in late

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Lil cousin got it right? and bike without no frame, ride the same rides without no brain?
Life ain't life, without no shame, if I make it out the hood, damn right I'm gon change
My cell phone number
But the area code still gon be 305 tho
My friends who was my friends just like my kin
Walked em in model?
But please wipe your feet on the rug
You can keep your shoes on, it's all love
Boy let me stop, I'm dreamin too much, now who the hell
'Gon give up a million bucks
Nobody but God, right now I could use me one of them black cards
I'm scarred, I fell apart, I came here with stars, its hard huh?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
F-F-F-Findin me
That day I been tryin to reach, that pay I been diein to see
Boy them folk wouldn't lie to me
I thought money ain't grow on trees
Depends on the roots, how you plant that seed
They quit, you can't see no leaves
Hold up, I need my versace's
Grace covers of magazines, my mother she proud of me
Myself, I, the one who the haters thought wasn't gon be shit
Big yachts, every day I get seasick, I was broke, the prefix
My book say "Why yall gave that nigga some cash?"
I wrote a song about it, wanna hear it? here it goes(Hook)
Oh, my god, I think, I'm freaking out
Too many drinks, too many rounds
I'm in the clouds, no coming down
(Dude I'm totally freaking out)

(Verse 1)
Oh my god, you got me in, and we can’t get out
Eenie meenie minie mo
It’s too easy I’m freaking out
You are the medic, I know your anatomy
It’s like a movie, should win an academy
I throw a salary, up when you strut at me
When there’s a policy, send a recovery
Heaven is like, give me a break
I give you some of that, (...)
Catching all on video tape
And play back the highlights tomorrow

Too much alcohol
Too many women every night
It’s a replay
What’s happening?

(Hook)

I plan to get white boy wasted
The villain in my face took a vacation
A lot of goons see me know I ain’t chasing
The room spinning ing ing ing
And I’m done
Shot like shark, bang bang, that’s a gun
I shoulda auditioned for hangover 1, 2, 3
Oh no, bartender said, you want a drink, oh no
On the side, never ever ever ever drink again
That’s it, drinks, so I will sip again
With a headache, throwing up slurring
Sex on the beach (...)

Too much alcohol
Too many women every night
It’s a replay
What’s happening?

[Flo Rida: Verse 1]
Money in my pocket

There they go again smelling like I wanna buy it
Shawty think I'm fresh I make em wet like fire hydrant
I be on that fly shit go from passenger to pilot
Point it out like gimme that
Point it out like gimme that
Point it out like gimme that, gimme that, gimme that
Why do I be stuntin’ to be honest I don’t know
Hundred after Hundred I don’t know
I love it l-l-l-l love it I got a problem
Its nothin’ nothin nothin nothin I'm poppin collars
Last week I flossed on em, bitch I made a movie
How you doin? Where you been? Hello to my groupies!
Swagga to the moon man, Gwap in my two hands
You can eat the fruit loops wrist full of Toucans
All types of colors, We family like brothers
My cash in my clean can't have one without the other
I stay

[Chrous]

[Lil Wayne: Verse 2]

Man I got bitches in my home
And bitches on my phone
I’m like can you call me back because SportsCenter is on
I don't mean to come off wrong
But man my money long
I say man my money long
Call me Stretch Armstrong
Big ass chain on my junk yard dog shit
Viagra swagga, fuck all yeall shit
Haha, mike stop the beat
Hear the money talk and it talking about me
White boy fresh…skinny ass pants
But I ball hard like scouts in the stands
I just sit around my house blowing ounce like a fan
I flip one of these niggas like Jackie Chan
I ain't worry bout em
I just ball out, Man I'm too cold lemme thaw out
Im so Young Money… I got dumb money
Beau-coup bread but a bitch can’t get a crumb from me

[Hook]

[Flo Rida: Verse 3]
Money in my pocket he ain't coming back to life
I gave her CPR blow thirty shooting dice
I’m married to the cash like somebody throwing rice
And I'm married to the cash I just had to say it twice
Tell me I ain't stuntin nah
Tell me I ain't stuntin nah
Tell me I ain't stuntin nah, nah, nah, nah, nah..
Put on for my city and I do it like I’m supposed to
Ballin’ like when Britney cut her hair I cut the checks fool
I do that d-d-d-do that im about my buisness
Like who that who-who-who that pushin the Bentley
Everybody staring thats Mister Mclaren
Loco con dinero like-like I was speaking spanish
Shine like a Disco
Dimes think its Crystal
Said she gotta twin then you know I’m callin Brisco
I ain't drink that Dom-P
I ain't drink that Dom-P
Them shawties spill my bottle on my Parlay Adore jeans[Produced By: FRANK E. & LooKas]

[Hook: Sage the Gemini]
I know what you came here to see
If you're a freak, then ya coming home with me
And I know what you came here to do
Now bust it open let me see you get loose
It's going down for real (x3)

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
Your girl just kissed a girl
I do bi chicks
Shake for a sheik, I'm throwing these Emirates in the sky
Spending this As-salamu alaykum, peace to M.O.N.E.Y
I love my beaches, south beaches, surfboard in high tide
I could just roll up cause I'm swoll up
So that birthday cake get the cobra
Bugatti for real, I'm cold bruh
That auto-biography rover
Got the key to my city it's over
It's no thots, only Anna Kournikova's
I set records, ratchets hold up
(I set records, ratchets hold up)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Sage the Gemini]
And they already know me
It's going down further than femurs
Girls get wetter than Katrina
Yeah my girl you never seen her
Cause my tints by limousines
My touch say it's the Midas
We the plus your man a minus
My team blowing on that slam
Make you cough-cough that's Bronchitis
Put your hands up
It's a stick up, no more makeup
Get that ass on the floor
Ladies put your lipstick up
Double entendre, double entendre
While you're hating I get money
Then I double up tonkers

[Hook]

[Bridge: Flo Rida]
Lift it, drop it, shake it, pop it
Lift it, drop it, shake it, pop it
Lift it, drop it, shake it, pop it
Lift it, drop it, shake it

Her smile shine like the sunlight

Friend muggin, she the hater type
Waka Flocka, I'm the player type (Flex)
Jewelry bright, winter white
Champagne chilled on ice

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tyga]
They your size, little waist don't match your thighs
Say you're on my level but my level too high
Looking in your eyes, don't look so surprised
I know you ain't heard that, before
Searching in the club and I just found one
Pick up lines, I just dropped mine
Single for the night, tryna double my fun
So whats up, to the bad bitch
In the corner, with her ass big
And her hair long, I'mma grab it
She call me daddy, but I'm a bastard
Like, I ain't tryna be horse & carriage
Or tryna take care of you, so put your bad habit
I just wanna smash it, smash it
Pass it, show you where the cash is, cash is
But first lemme see you...

[Extended Hook: Flo Rida]

So that was my cue, ayo Fab (ey Khaled)

[Fabolous]
Shorty wanna give me the go ahead
That I'mma stay even when I need to go head
And if I feel something I'mma try
Figured you winked at me not just something in your eye
See shawty you ain't got to tell me what I know
That was E-40 who said "tell me when to go"
I know I got the green light, and ya'll get the red light
So if the head right I'll be there err night
Err night like a playoff game
You hard working haters take a day off man
We the what? (We the best!)
Thats so true, when I walk in this bitch baby that's your cue

[Hook: Lloyd]
I know you see me starin girl

Girl tell me, what's on your mind, let me know
Girl give me the go, give me the go ahead

Girl give me the go, give me the go ahead

We can do that, there, just gimme the go
Been a playa unprepared, everybody grown folks
'Round here, them gold bottles hold them up
Then we can say, cheeers (Let's take a toast)
No wheat or white bread in my Pilsbury dough
Just give me the right head with the letters G-O
All eyes if you like your momma, lame as a video
Imagine you and other kitties strollin' all over the city

[Hook] - first half only

[Fat Joe]
Crack! How hot is hot?
She on fire baby burn the block
I even taught her how to turn to pot
You cool it off, and it come back rock (crack!)
Yes! I am him
Pull strings like a violin
Then I cross over like I'm Iverson
To Z100 out to Ireland
White chicks is standin on line
Black chicks is standin on line
Don't discriminate, I disintegrate
So much cake, maybe we can get away

[Verse 1]
Yes I can, doubt to believe what I know what’s his plan
Pull me, grab me, grab till the bucket can’t have me
I’ll be the president one day
January first, oh, you like that gossip
Like you the one drinking what God sip dot com
Now I gotta work with your tone
How many rolling stones you want
Yeah I got a brand new spirit
Speaking when it’s done
Woke up on the side of the bed like I won
Talk like a winner, my chest to that sun
G5 dealer, U.S to Taiwan
Now who can say that, I wanna play back
Mama knew I was a needle in a hay stack
A bugatti boy, plus maybach
I got a feeling it’s a rap asap

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
The mountain top, walk on water
I got power, feel so royal
One second, I’ma strike oil
Diamond, platinum, no more for you
Gotta drill a land, never giving in
Giving up’s not an option and gotta get it in
Witness I got the heart of 20 men
No fear go to sleep in the lion’s den
That flow, that spark, that crown
You looking at the king of the jungle now
Stronger than ever can’t hold me down
A hundred miles gunning for the pitcher's mound
Straight game face, it’s game day
See me running through the crowd full of melee?
No trick plays, I’m Bill Gates, take a genius to understand me

[Hook]
