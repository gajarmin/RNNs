But i know yous a schoolboy, you know how i know your a schoolboy, cause i did my homework on you
Cause your government name is jonathan ancrum
You went to ford pelham catholic

Cause you left the violence out your life, played sports, and went the college route
So where you get all these whips, clips, chips, that you ryhme about
Come on dog cut it out with these fictional tales
About digital sclaes
Cause deep down in his sioul i know this nigga is frail
See he lie cause he dont know how to be himself in his raps
So he fabricate punch lines about raps and flippin them packs
But see i speak from the heart thats why niggas feel this shit
Nigga i keep it real, you dont even keep it realistic

Im the shit look at my last battles for proof
My bars make niggas go whoo that littl enigga theres the truth
I go from sicily to brooklyn, harlem to hong kong
Belgoium to the bronx from the bronx i be long gome
His man a bitch someone trow him some pom poms
Ain't shit when i trow sivler in your long johns
Eyo the sterrts keep buzzing, murda mook everywhere
This nigga prblaby telling niggas he my cousin, easyLife in the city is not very pretty
It seems such a waste of your time

This Serius Jones
And this song right here is for the city
Every city, that's space created for millions of lives to reside
From NY to the Chi
LA to the Bay
ATL, Bricks
Everywhere in between
See we all part of the same thing man
It's a soundtrack to our lives
Feel me
Let's go!

[Verse 1]
Now when you raised in the struggle, the pain and the hustle
Keep you caged in, it's a shame, the game don't love you
But, what other ways we know to raise this dough
Kids with death on they brain, y'all know it's crazy though
Them old ladies know what's going on in that hallway
All day that raw yae moving on Broadway
Fuck what the law say, fours spray in broad day
Just look at the right person the wrong way
They got me stressing at a fast pace
I lean my seat back at tapes and blast the bass
And analyze how our lives get trapped in this place
That ain't safe, for this cheese it's like a rat race
And see, they wanna try to make your back break
Castrate the black fate cause our past was great
But wait, they don't know that make us stronger than ever
We storm through the weather, see sometimes stress could make you better

[Hook]
See we forced into criminal life
And yeah I know I ain't living it right, but God help me (Lord)
See it's the bright lights and busy nights
And when you dealing with that city life, it ain't healthy (nah)
Cause it's always stress on our mind (all the time)
And everybody just stuck in the grind (all the time)
You gotta take it one day at a time
We get drunk and high sometimes cause you need that

[Verse 2]
It make it hard to be friendly and smiling
It's survival mind state, watch your enemies prowling
Especially if you live in the housing, it be piled in
And every year thousands get sent to the mountains
(You got) young Italians with Mafia ties
There's cops in disguise that ride by with hate in they eyes
And the lawbreakers is the lawyers with briefcases
That beat cases, teenagers with scarfaces
(And what else?)
Plus, them Green Acres folks come here with dreams
Eventually they lose steam and then turn into fiends
The queens turn into ho's, friends turn into foes
And the good die young, shit you know how it goes
(The city's like) a sick body and The Man is the brain
The people is the blood and the trains, they like veins
The streets, like the skin, and garbage is cologne
For a short time I called this my home, but I know it's real

[Hook][Hook]
How could this be? Look out the window, what do I see?
I see angels and demons at war, what are we hustlin' for?
I wanna be free, sometimes I ask GOD "What about me?"
Why can't I have the life that I dream?
This can't be how it's supposed to be

[Verse 1: Serius Jones]
Just holding down your house is a sprain
All accounts gettin' drained, lifting couches for change
The whole game is a drought and the rain keep drowning your brain
Streets announcing your name
When dreams fall, nightmares come true
And in a heated fight, where's Sun Tzu?
The Art of War is a big picture
It ain't hard to draw blood over a little rock, look at Arkansas
My heart is pure so I pardon yours
I was born in the cores, my only flaw is I absorb it all
I try to stick to the script, follow protocols
Cause even Left Eye died chasin' waterfalls
Where's the glory for the good soldier?
Kush boulder, stretching my mind out; that's hood yoga
Formulating my next mass to move ruthless
Cause it seems like the coolest we lose, I be confuse like...

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Jay Rock WMG
Pushing nice whips, still gutta, crack a hole on the 10 speed
Still on the block like a D.B
On my grind heavy shittin' on them, where the T.P.?
They ain't like me now but these broads steady swangin' on my wee-wee
Never hit 'em raw, hear them "Ahh" when I beat-beat
Keep it Booya! when I'm moving through the streets
Money, Power, Respect, I'm working with all three
Looking out my window, rolling up that Indo
Thinking about my life and self, what am I here for?
Had a thing for hoopin' but that dream was shattered
Then the bricks, gangbanging, and selling rocks what mattered
Surrounded my angels and demons like Tom Hanks
Who do you trust? Friend or a foe? Your bitch or a ho?
What I'm hustling for? Me and my familia
Come between that - then I'm killin' ya

[Hook][Hook : Oh No iTs Y.O]
See we get it get it, see we got it locked
In the club showing off...getting rocked
Bottle after bottle, sip after sip
Hobble on a model drinking WE DO IT BIG!
We do it big, yea we do it big
In the club showing off...we do it big
We do it big, yea we do it big
In the club showing off...we do it bigLife in the city is not very pretty
