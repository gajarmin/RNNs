[Bun B]
Yeah, when I step in the spot, motherfuckers say "who that?"
Big Bun B, but you already knew that
Live from the state where they chop it and screw that
You hatin' on the trill OG, where they do that? (for real!)
Motherfuckers need to get off the dick, man
Fall the fuck back like a bike with no kickstand
Get out my mix man, just go' get you stuck
Deeper in the quicksand, with no easy fix, man
No tricks, man, those is for kids
Kush in my cigar, and hoes in the crib
Drank, and the 20 ounce froze in the fridge
You fuckin' with PA so you know what it is
I'm sittin on the fours that clack
Comin' down candy in the golden 'Lac
We gettin' to the money like it's Goldman Sachs
And we do it for the pimps that are holding back, let's go!

[Nas]
Look who crept in with automatic weapons
Reppin' QB till the death of him
That nigga that inspired lyrical tyrants like Kanye West and Em
Track record, goes back to the Essence
Smack adolescents who ask who the best is
I'm nasty like gas from a fat man's intestines
I pass it, you gaspin' for breath and you die fast
Gut 'em like a gastric bypass
But ya Nas advocates actors seemed to get typecast in the same role
Since 16 I ain't grow a day old yet my brain grow
Cocaine white Range Rov'
Tats on my body like an art exhibit
I did real good for a project nigga
Was once a Bacardi sipper, now it's Chandon
Fat blunts in the car with strippers
Guns in compartments hidden
I was real young little youth, a novice nigga
Blessings, bowed down, respected
Chowed down, now my food's digested
Pow pow, with my shooters are Techs
That'll bust louder than the noise that I just spit
Let's get one thing straight that my crown ain't for testin', testin'
Chop heads off like King Henry VIII
Guillotine to ya neck bitch
I'm a king in this thing, don't be dumb
Been in this shit since '91
Niggas can't fuck with the style I use
Your fate is sealed, no Heidi Klum
Calm now, was a wylin' dude
Studied cowards and made power moves
Watched Wild Planet seen lions devour food
You can say that's how I move
A monster nigga, and I don't really like doing songs with niggas
There go my nigga Wayne
Let them niggas hate or like my nigga Drake say
"We ain't got time to respond to niggas"

[Shyne]
I'm a villain, I'm a villain, all that happens in the street
Poverty and desperation made me everything I be
I'm a shotta, when I pop up with them poppers burn ya block up
Call the judges, call the coppers, we takin' over Gotham
Word to Poppa, Blood gang, five
It’s that Blood gang five, but green is the bottom line
I run this town, I ain’t gon' lie, they run they mouth, they ain’t gon' fight
They actin' like they ain’t gon' die until I let them 'llamas fly
Flatbush to Bed-do-or-die, from Watts to Larry Hoover Chi
Poverty and heroine, it’s no place for a juvenile
Put greed in our heart, it’s the green that we want
Cash Money is the company and Weezy the boss!

[Busta Rhymes]
They say I’m underrated, but un-compete-with-able
Understandable, being that my rating levels are unreachable
Anything said other than that should be silenced, unspeakable!
And the thought of you being nicer than me, unfeasible!
They ask is what I do ever gonna stop, this shit will never end
That’s when you hear a car crash in the vocal booth got 'em sayin' “there he goes again!"
See now they nominated a nigga to come and
Flatten everything now let me dominate it, nigga run
And they be knowin' that I be blackin' on everything
And make it complicated like a nigga constipated with a gun
I gotta make it what they want and wake ‘em when I come
And shake 'em and bake 'em and take 'em to another place
Ain’t no fakin’, ain’t no kind of mistakin' how I be breakin'
Up everything and be creating a s-s-s-situation when I’m done (DAMN!)
You see I spit National Treasure, discography rich
And I done killed more cats than curiosity, snitch!
Most of you niggas sorry and owe apologies, quick
What the fuck you niggas still hangin' around here for, you apostrophe bitch?
Okay, now enough of that, see now I’m out the door
Tunechi, thanks for giving us a whole 'nother classic with tha Carter IV[Shyne]
Now tell me who want to fuck with us?
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
I bang - and let your fuckin' brains hang, snitches
Fuck Marla Maples, bitches with riches
Who carry 22's, up in they hosiery
A black teller when my father bust and unloaded me
Think he just finished sniffin a ki, and dippin the D's
Don't hate me, hate Nicky Barnes for hittin my moms
Letting the condom pop, nigga I was born in the drop
Coke boil in the pot, shake the Feds
And bust shots at them street cops
Fuck yo' point is? My point is double fours at your fuckin jaws
Pointed, hollow point shit
Four-point-six, need I say more?
Or do you get the point bitch? C'mon

What type of nigga slang and bang in the streets? (Bad Boyz)
What type of nigga stay in the Trump for weeks? (Bad Boyz)
What type of nigga fly Bentley Coupes? (Bad Boyz)
Aim for the sky, cock the shit then shoot

[Shyne]
Minks draggin on the floor - bangin on your whore
Suckin the croissant just examine it for flaws
Pour the Cristal on the way to trial, RICO law
Got a nigga head hurtin squirtin til they pull the curtain
Let the money drip dry, hundred dollar bills
Wipe the tears from my eyes, no love
Fuck y'all niggas, hope you die a slow death
As I coke-test and C. DeLores Tucker protest
Can't fuck with you weak rap niggas, witcha gay raps
Runnin 'round talkin this and talkin that
See me in the streets, tried to give me dap
Andrew Cunanan ass niggas
My two cannons blast niggas, ask niggas
Got me fucked up in the game, get your shirt stained
Keep your five mics nigga, give me the 'caine
Do the shit to clean my money dummies, gleamed the wrist out
Cop the pist-al, nigga, talk shit now, uh

What type of nigga slang and bang in the streets? (Bad Boyz)
What type of nigga stay in the Trump for weeks? (Bad Boyz)
What type of nigga fly Bentley Coupes? (Bad Boyz)
Aim for the sky, cop the shit then shoot

[Shyne]
Bling bling, it's a Bad Boy thing
Bullets heat-seekin, streep sweepin, with an evil grin
Watch you die, one love, one life, one Shyne
Y'all niggas ain't sayin nothin, like a mime
Every line, I live it, I write it with a pencil so niggas die
Of lead poison if they bite it, hate it but recite it
It's a G thang, me and Puff in St. Bart's set it off
Bitches walkin topless with G-strings, menage'
Bust shots at your crew, another charge
As the gulf stream fly through the fog
Make ya popular
Pockets filled with more high notes than the opera
Franklins on top of the - Jacksons
My nigga Ty leave you tired
Bad Boy, repsect it or die, coward

What type of nigga slang and bang in the streets? (Bad Boyz)

Man a Bad Boy on the corner
So move from on here, cause we a dange-rous
Man a Bad Boy on the corner
So move from on here, cause we a dange-rous

{*Barrington skats and shouts to the fade*}[Intro: Usher]
Baby I know we said it's best we don't talk no more
But I got to get this off my chest about all the shit I've been hearing babe I
I thought you were that ride or die
You will never leave my side
I even made you out to be the woman that I will be with for life I took in
Your kids did everything that you wanted me too
Heard about frontin' on radio and the fuse
If you were gonna tell it then you told instead of making me the bad guy
If you got nothing good to say then don't say nothing
Cause if I really start talking it'll be something
So you cheated, I cheated
So be it
We need to leave it alone
Move on

[Call waiting beeping]
[Usher] Hold up
[Operator] Hello, you got a collect call from Clinton Correctional Facility will you accept the charges?
[Usher] Yes, I'll accept it, what's up?

[Shyne - rapping on the phone]
Sittin' in my cell, head about to burst
Wouldn't be alive if I didn't shoot first
Had it made, sorry for the ricochet
But I'd be in the grave if I didn't let it spray
I never said that I was perfect
Nobody walking on this earth is
That night, I would've got murdered
If I ain't grab the ratchet and let them cowards have it

[JD]
Uh, listen up, listen up, listen up, world
Listen up, listen up, listen up, world
Uh, I gotta confess
This is the hottest remix I ever did in my life
So So Def

[Hook - Usher] (J.D.)
These are my confessions, just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions, man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all (all)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call (call)
I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do
But to give part two of my confessions

[JD]
If you got something to confess to right now step to the mic, Twista!

[Twista]
I confess about the incident when I was with a shorty in the Lexus Coupe
Ya homie said she saw me but she didn't have proof
But I knew I really should've just been tellin' you the truth
And I confess about the days
I was rollin' my Seville with the custom gold grill
I was in the field still lookin' for a thrill
And I knew it was bogus I should've kept it real
And I confess that just when I thought I could really try to get away
Or have another woman on the side
But I never knew it would catch up wit' a nigga one day
You gotta hear me girl, I done learned a lesson
If you stay wit' me then it'll be a blessin'
No stressin', it'll never be no guessin'
Cause I'm pourin' out my heart and these are my confessions

[Hook]

[Kanye West:]
Man, how did she bring it up? How did she break it down?
Man, you at the clinic? Dog, slow down that's your child
But if you keep it, then you gotta tell your girl you was cheatin'
And you went raw dog when you beat it
That's when she gon' tell you to beat it
You know it ain't y'all little secret, you famous you can't go nowhere
Cause everytime you go there, it's hoes there
So basically you and your girl over
I know when she broke the news you told her "Man, don't say that"
Matter fact like Pat don't say jack
Everytime a nigga sittin' on pay stacks
Things come up from way, way, way back

[Hook]

[JD]
Po! That's the boy Shyne, y'all
The boy on his way home, man
The boy on his way home, man![Shyne]
Uhh, uhh
In front of Gucci in the winter, I seen ya witcha girls
Walkin uh, in your chinchilla fur
I was laid up in the Coupe, back shade up
Lookin at cha face just pure wit no makeup
A little bit of Mac lip gloss, hair in a bun well done
Lookin for a ring, I seen none
So I hopped out the Coupe in hot pursuit
To stop and, introduce
Like I'm Shyne, and you? You my destiny
And ya diamond cluster, too much just to touch ya
Perfume, down to ya structure
Think I'll wait, until the second night to fuck ya
I wanna marry you, nah I'm just playin
But we can start wit a few nights, out in Malibu
Surfin, layin up on Persians
Here's my number; put in ya purse and call me

[Hook: Barrington Levy]
On the telephone, she heard my voice
Tell me to pick her up in my Rolls Royce
If my Rolls Royce, is not for ladies
Then girl I'm gonna take you in my Mercedes
If my Mercedes will not fill up wit the disease
Then girl I'm gonna take you in my Firebird
If my Firebird cannot take the curve
Girl put your ass in the damn Metro bus

[Shyne]
We gettin clo-ser, my player days is o-ver
Well maybe not completely
But still and all, come here, rest ya head on my bed
And let me get between ya legs
Lay on ya back, uh - take it from the back
Like a bad girl suppose to, I know you like that
Scream, wake the neighbors from they sleep
Grab the sheets witcha teeth, wiggle ya butt cheeks
Pour Cristal over ya body, lick you up
Treat you like a convenience store, stick you up
Take you to the balcony, pick you up
So you can look at the city, while I'm diggin ya kitty
Then we drive into the sunset, pull over
Get up on the hood ma, I ain't done yet, uhh

[Hook]

[Shyne] (Barrington Levy)
We've been together for a few months now
Did it all, Four Seasons to the Trump
Beverly Hills bungalows in ya underclothes
In Paris, Eiffel Tower bubble baths and showers
In a silindo sheen, sincere is what you seem
See me flip a couple things, load up magazines
And I - I think you might be the right one, whoa (the right one)
Wait press the brakes, gotta investigate
What I do know - to you it don't matter
Whether my pockets is slim or fatter
Whether it's BBQ's or Mr. Chow's platter
Even if I slip off the success ladder
Even if the paragraphs, didn't hit the charts and smash
If my car was a train on the surface or back
I think you'd be right there (know you'll be right there)
Cause we right there, no Cartier charms
Just you in my arms, no Chandon
Just a bottle of Avian; c'mon, uh

[Hook]

[Barrington Levy]
So I draw from my tonic and I take one sip
Should've seen me cause I gallop like a horse'll get whipped
Come quick yeahhhhhhhhh, come quick whoaaaaaaaaaa
Cause you I love, and not another
Although some may change, girl you know I will never
I'mma love love love love love love you forever, oh-ii
Always be there - for me
Always be there
Be there for me
Ohhhhhhhhh, ayah, ayah, ayah, ayah, ayah
Ohhhhhhhhh
For me, for me..Shyne
( for the record )

Where he at, where he at?
Uhh
(repeat 3x)

[Verse 1]
Do he rhyme with a slur from some shots in his face
Or he rhyme with a slur tryna sound like Ma$e
Listen to his tape, this lil' nigga used to sound like Case
Maybe I'm juss trippin, maybe he juss snitchin
See it a whole lot different from my cell in Clinton
What I see is straight bird, straight girl
Yea you be a killa, if you could kill with words
Gotta look at the facts and not the hype
Like who got shot and who got knifed
Who keep gettin struck, but don't never strike
Hope the beef go away when the feds indict
I know yo card nigga, it's so clear
You just wanna sell records you don't want warfare
You don't wanna ride you wanna get rich and hide
These niggas would've died if they shot me nine times
Hey it's just for the record
Take this mob shit serious, please respect it

[Hook]
And there go the shots they rip 'em apart
Gushes of blood comin' out of his lungs
It's murdah bloody homicide is what they cry
When they losin' their life
When muhfuckaz ax me how I sleep at night
Pretty good witta slug and my heat held tight
Pray to God when I'm gone, this what he felt like
Finish my work on this earth nigga turn off the lights

[Verse 2]
You ain't kill Hommo cause if you did
Why you ain't get the kid that ordered the hit
You know I know, that if you live
That shit that you spit, somebody got somebody
Somebody got jumped, somebody got cut
You a boxer nigga, nobody got snuffed
Nobody got crushed, you screamin what what
Okay killa you is the slut
Think about it, enough is enough
Time to show who is who
And what is what
I mean how can I respect you
When them niggas that left you ain't none of 'em blessed you
(not 1 body)
You know where they are, where they perform
Bust yo gun, stop makin songs
Please no more ghetto quran
You got money now it's time to bomb
And that's just for the time
Take this mob shit serious please respect it

And there go the shots they rip 'em apart (2x)
Gushes of blood comin' out of his lungs

[Verse 3]
Death of perfection as I move without motion
Ain't a nigga in this game do the shit that I'm quotin'
Good look you'll never see another me
Might be sum otha g's tryna trace n color me
But I believe in the ways of old
You slit a fools throat tryna tell on PO
Rats shouldn't exist, fuck a snitch
Cut of his dick, put it on his lips
You really think I was gon' let you slide
Fuckin wit me you must be out yo mind
You really think jail was gon' make thinks right
Nigga I'll hold shop till you lose yo life
I was mindin' my own, word got back, niggas talkin bout PO
I was like oh? God must be ready for this nigga to go
Gangland, this is the mob
You got yo break come finish the job
Juss don't get the feds involved
And I'mma reunite you with yo moms
Rip
I guess this ain't juss music
Cause jail only made me much mo' ruthless (nigga)
And the bitch nigga knew this
That's why he tried to sign me to g-unit
Tell 'em how you made me offers
( I don't run with that blood I'mma godfather)
Loved on every street corner
Hurts yo heart that you don't get that honor
The feds I paid for that
10 years up top
Not 7 months shop
Walked the yard with bloods
Took the bus with cuffs
Went gun for gun
I earned my love
You, you just pathetic
You'll neva be a G, despite yo efforts
Take this mob shit serious, you gon' respect it
Thats just fo the record

[Hook]
And there go the shots they rip 'em apart
Gushes of blood comin' out of his lungs
It's murdah bloody homicide is what they cry
When they losin' their life
When muhfuckaz ax me how I sleep at night
Pretty good witta slug and my heat held tight
Pray to God when I'm gone, is what he felt like
Finish my work on this earth and turn off the lightsOnce upon a time, not long ago
When gangstas rocked waves sold dope and sniffed lo'
There was a young G by the name of Shyne Poe
Puttin' it down, cuttin' it up and cookin' it now
It's been a lotta dick ridin' for lack of a betta words
Speculations on the guns I hold underneath my furs
Similarities in my voice nigga check the words
I'm in for winter to doe's that pinch merds from the cur
Dodgin' and dippin' the narcs
It's the young Frank Matthews the rap version
Touch my trap on my smack the gats burstin'
That's certain leave ya face and ya chest and ya back jerkin'
Uh--y'all got me fucked up like
My desert eagle and my sick doom bust right
Like my guns is racin',muthafucka don't you know I
Make ya heart stop and ya body start shakin'
Now you know the bottom line of this rhyme crime
25 to life plus 9

[Hook 2X]
Whatcha gon' do when shit hit the fed
Take it like a man or snitch like a bitch
Whatcha gon' do when shit hit the fan
Pray to God, go hard or lay up in the morgue

Evil grin,dead eyes,walkin wit a bock, monster
Best way to describe my posture
In this world of sin I'm as wicked as they come
Moonlightin' as a rapper get this ticket and I'm done
Ain't enough money here I ratha be in the tropics
Wit Corsicans where narcotics is the only topic
Persian rocks and things the man that made of snow
Tiger par
And every other form of raw
Since a team been handlin, nigga been scramblin'
Bettin' on money in Vegas gamblin'
Desert in the abdomen, pissy drunk stylin',staggerin'
More than you can imaginin
Uh--thoughts randomin, runnin through my mind
Like who's the best MC's - Biggie, Jay-Z, and Shyne
Demented as a young'n, apple 2nd comin'
Evil thoughts runnin' through my cerebellum
Shyne Poe what the fuck you gon' tell 'em?
All you niggas that wanna be fly my gun shots'll propell 'em
Leavin' somewhere smellin', repellin'
Closed caskets for you fuckin' bastards c'mon

[Hook]

Only the strong survive, weak niggas bleed
And get found, wit they fuckin' face down
Numb from the waist down
I din been to hell and back
Twice and still in crack
Stare death in the eyes and never blink
Headshots rip through my mink
Went to war wit the realist killas
Killed friends over jealousy and envy
My heart's empty
Behind the wheel of my Bentley
Coke-d up feelin invincible
Bout to take over the world I can't be stopped
Not the feds or the fuckin' cops
Not even 17 shots
Can put a end to this terror
I'mma live forever, cause gangstas don't break
We just get plastic surgery and relocate
To anotha state
Or island, smilin, money pilin, wildin
Yo Puff over done them fuckin violins
Uh this shit is bigger than me though ask Oliver North
Kill you then use your corpse,to transport horse
Leave ya brains hangin' from ya fuckin' car window
Any nigga snitch and givin' info
Since my motha stomach coke and liquor
Was the mixture
Betta be prepared when we hit ya

[Hook] - repeat to fade[Intro]

But he doesn't feel a girl like her, he's so so wrapped up
Cuz the average girl will give him anything that he wants

He's so caught up (He's so caught up)
He won't call her, he shows no love

What type of nigga fly Bentley Coupes? (Bad Boyz)
Aim for the sky, cop the shit then shoot

[Barrington Levy]

Man a Bad Boy on the corner
So move from on here, cause we a dange-rous
Man a Bad Boy on the corner
So move from on here, cause we a dange-rous

{*Barrington skats and shouts to the fade*}[Verse 1]
I done fucked *The Baddest Bitches* ask Trina
Give her coke to stuff between her, said she loved my demeanor
Felonies and misdemeanors, I'm villified
I just, rap on the side, black mafia ties
Prolific words, I speak for the unheard
Niggas who love guns, money, girls, and furs
Sittin up in the mans', runnin shit
On the phone moving bricks, orderin hits
Perfected the game, diamond infested the chain
Niggas think I change I just wanna watch 'em change
Livin the American dream
Drugs, violence, sex, and loaded magazines
That's all I could talk about in these sixteen
Cuz that's all I live, ask Tibs
It is what is, either graveyards or consecutive life bids, shit

CHORUS 4X:
Niggas wanna bang, we could bang
Niggas wanna slang, we could slang

[Verse 2]
Niggas wanna bang we could bang out
Til the clip's done, or your vital arteries hang out
Hammer cocked, Bad Boy, the black Camelot
Raise the price and connect the dots
Through life's journies, all I need is a couple of mack mils
A couple of mils and good attorneys
Skatin on big blades, goin out in a blaze in my last days
I'll probably die with a bad drug trade or an overdose
Without tellin my moms, sorry it was close
My wife and my bitch fightin over my notes
All my niggas skied north makin a toast
Til hell, just gimme bad bitches in Channel
Connects wit, Chinese cartels and that new SL
And the judge that's gon' set my bail

CHORUS

[Verse 3]
I'm on top of this shit, look at the wrists
Too much rocks in this shit, ain't that a bitch
Make hits, til my last breath
With that nigga, the P U double F
So lay back in the cut motherfucker 'fore you get shot
I kill niggas on the spot like a cop
I did it all four seasons suites to a cot
Give bitches nothing but breathmints and this cock
Call me what, there's a way to eat
And all we got is sports, entertainment or the streets
I'm in deep, think of Citibank when I sleep
Ching, ching like I was from Shaolin
Brooklyn nigga what you say, keep stylin
My air force ones you couldn't walk a mile in
I love politics, narcotics, and violins
Bad Boy forever, we move in silence

CHORUS[Shyne]
Uhh, uhh
In front of Gucci in the winter, I seen ya witcha girls
Walkin uh, in your chinchilla fur
I was laid up in the Coupe, back shade up
Lookin at cha face just pure wit no makeup
A little bit of Mac lip gloss, hair in a bun well done
Lookin for a ring, I seen none
So I hopped out the Coupe in hot pursuit
To stop and, introduce
Like I'm Shyne, and you? You my destiny
And ya diamond cluster, too much just to touch ya
Perfume, down to ya structure
Think I'll wait, until the second night to fuck ya
I wanna marry you, nah I'm just playin
But we can start wit a few nights, out in Malibu
Surfin, layin up on Persians
Here's my number; put in ya purse and call me

[Hook: Barrington Levy]
On the telephone, she heard my voice
Tell me to pick her up in my Rolls Royce
If my Rolls Royce, is not for ladies
Then girl I'm gonna take you in my Mercedes
If my Mercedes will not fill up wit the disease
Then girl I'm gonna take you in my Firebird
If my Firebird cannot take the curve
Girl put your ass in the damn Metro bus

[Shyne]
We gettin clo-ser, my player days is o-ver
Well maybe not completely
But still and all, come here, rest ya head on my bed
And let me get between ya legs
Lay on ya back, uh - take it from the back
Like a bad girl suppose to, I know you like that
Scream, wake the neighbors from they sleep
Grab the sheets witcha teeth, wiggle ya butt cheeks
Pour Cristal over ya body, lick you up
Treat you like a convenience store, stick you up
Take you to the balcony, pick you up
So you can look at the city, while I'm diggin ya kitty
Then we drive into the sunset, pull over
Get up on the hood ma, I ain't done yet, uhh

[Hook]

[Shyne] (Barrington Levy)
We've been together for a few months now
Did it all, Four Seasons to the Trump
Beverly Hills bungalows in ya underclothes
In Paris, Eiffel Tower bubble baths and showers
In a silindo sheen, sincere is what you seem
See me flip a couple things, load up magazines
And I - I think you might be the right one, whoa (the right one)
Wait press the brakes, gotta investigate
What I do know - to you it don't matter
Whether my pockets is slim or fatter
Whether it's BBQ's or Mr. Chow's platter
Even if I slip off the success ladder
Even if the paragraphs, didn't hit the charts and smash
If my car was a train on the surface or back
I think you'd be right there (know you'll be right there)
Cause we right there, no Cartier charms
Just you in my arms, no Chandon
Just a bottle of Avian; c'mon, uh

[Hook]

[Barrington Levy]
So I draw from my tonic and I take one sip
Should've seen me cause I gallop like a horse'll get whipped
Come quick yeahhhhhhhhh, come quick whoaaaaaaaaaa
Cause you I love, and not another
Although some may change, girl you know I will never
I'mma love love love love love love you forever, oh-ii
Always be there - for me
Always be there
Be there for me
Ohhhhhhhhh, ayah, ayah, ayah, ayah, ayah
Ohhhhhhhhh
For me, for me..LYRICS:
[Intro - Naftali Kalfa]
This whole world, the whole wide world is just a narrow bridge,
This whole world, the whole wide world is just a narrow bridge.
The main stage we gotta face is in the world above,
The main stage we gotta face is in the world to come.
And the main thing is to have no fear,
And the main thing is to have no fear at all.

[Verse - Shyne]
I am not afraid; I was made with a lion heart,
Feet planted on the floor, with my eye on God,
I was born, to overcome challenges,
I do the work, but God is the catalyst.

In every single generation, they try to wipe us out,
Standing up, attempting to, bring our end about.
And the sacred one above, protects us with his mighty love,
And the blessed one above saves us from their hands.

I am not afraid; I was made from another cloth,
Just say my prayers, keep my faith and my trust in God
We busting off, at the Taliban and Iran
Above the law, in that caravan panaram
We the raw, praises to the lord
Raise my glass to the ceiling and we ready for the war
Ready for the Ohr , cause Messiah about to come
Lion from the slums, lion and the cub
Roaring king of Judah, Shyne is the one
Kohelet is the Melech, and we high above the sun
Dovid is beloved, and I am just the son
Tell me who gonna stop me, I've just begun
I am so courageous I could face anything
God took me out of nothing and gave me everything
Shyne going hard, till the day they bury him
Son of Judah and God is the ruler.

I am not afraid, not afraid at all,
I am not afraid, not afraid at all.

I am not afraid; I was made from the temple ashes,
From the darkness come light, so where the matches,
Prepare for the world to come,
This the practice, never defeated, I was made from eternal fabric

I am not afraid; I am here to take it all or none,
The only thing I ever fear, is the God above,
King David, I am here to play the harp and drum,
On the battlefield, until Messiah come.

I am not afraid, not afraid at all,
I am not afraid, not afraid at all[Hook:Shyne]
Buffalo soldier, no I'm not a rasta
I used to be a mobster burning down the block
Buffalo soldier, no I'm not a rasta
I used to be a mobster burning down the block

[Verse 1: Matisyahu]
Don't judge a book by the cover
Every single being in this world is your brother
When I lost my fun, the page and uncover
Ancient words that teach me to love ya
So we burn to return to the mother
And we yearn to unlearn all they told ya about yourself
Who you are, what you should be
I'm gonna be free leave it up to me

Shouts through the sky, look out through the night, feel alright
Stars burn bright, highlight the moonlight, you'll be alright

[Hook: Matisyahu]
Buffalo soldier, no I'm not a rasta
Used to be a mobster burning up the block
Buffalo soldier, no I'm not a rasta
Used to be a mobster burning up the block
Buffalo soldier, no I'm not a rasta
Used to be a mobster burning up the block
This is the medicine, I'm out like the bedouin
This knife I'm burying and this life I'm treasuring

Buffalo soldier, no I'm not a rasta
Buffalo soldier, no I'm not a rasta

[Verse 2: Matisyahu]
I went running away to the cave
Went in a slave and came out all flames
I went running away for the hills
Back to my roots and I'm running still
But now I'm running to face my dreams
Found my place and what it means
Find yourself and no one else
You have to leave it up to me, leave it up to me

[Hook:]
Buffalo soldier, no I'm not a rasta
I used to be a mobster burning up the block
Buffalo soldier, no I'm not a rasta
I used to be a mobster burning up the block
Buffalo soldier, no I'm not a rasta
I used to be a mobster burning up the block
This is the medicine, I'm out like the bedouin
With this knife I'm buryin, this life I'm treasuring

Buffalo soldier, no I'm not a rasta
Buffalo soldier, no I'm not a rasta

[Verse 3: Shyne]
Buffalo soldier, no I'm not a rasta
I used to be a mobster burning down the block
Bra, I shot the sheriff, the DA, and the deputy
Sorry Al Sharpton I don't need you to lecture me
Maybe I'll stop talking about guns
When you talk about the funds that they cut for the youth
Let's cut to the truth, ain't enough for the youth
So tell me how you judge me til you're stuck in the shoes, man!
Where the Congressmen, where all the Senators?
They're thinking about their green, not the color of the President?
This is just a relevance, survival is the sentiment
Narcotics is the only way you know that I'm a measure it!
They say that we are in a post Obama era
Well exactly what that mean? you needn't make it clearer
Does it mean that the rich are gonna finally start to share up
Reproportion the wealth and make things fairer
Asking God "why do poor people suffer" but now I'm such a hypocrite, the
Rolls Royce mufflers
In the gulus nobody never loved us
I am just the result of pain and hunger!

[Hook:]
Buffalo soldier, no I'm not a rasta
I used to be a mobster burning up the block
Buffalo soldier, no I'm not a rasta
I used to be a mobster burning up the block
Buffalo soldier, no I'm not a rasta
I used to be a mobster burning up the block
This is the medicine, I'm out like the bedouin
With this knife I'm buryin, this life I'm treasuring[Verse 1: Shyne]
This little buster name the Game wanna rhyme like Po
Cuz I rhyme like gold
I rhyme like, I be climbin' out that Rolls
The nine I let it blow, put 5 up in ya clothes
Head shots leave you slumped, reclinin' through ya door
Oh'- this is blasphemy
Ya whole entire career patterned after me
I got shooters out in Cali that will blast for me
Your forgot, I put your chest where your back should be
Tec squeeze off rapid speed
I'm in Paris at the Plaza, blood, ask for me
Ungrateful bastard, say your grace after meal
Bow down pay homage and ask to breathe
? Shyne, Michael, or Moses, homicidal motives
Thinkin' this is showbiz, I will put you with the blowfish
Hand on my toasters, Lamborghini roadsters
Gave these rappers life but I turn them into ghosts

[Hook]
I think I'm Big Wolf, Young RZA
Clay Bone, squeezing triggers
Gangland, we the mob
Shyne M-F Po, rap god
I think I'm Big Wolf, Young RZA
Big U, squeezing triggers
Gangland, we the mob
Shyne M-F Po, rap god

[Verse 2: Shyne]
Smoking the Cuban, twisting on my sidelocks
This sideway representer with them sideshots
9 shots from that 6 or 9 Glock
My alibi done bought it sunny at the sky box
Fraud dudes, must be on that dog food
Ain't nothing change Gangland still mob rules
Still flexing, still netting off that god jew
Send you straight to the mob, ain't no law suit
Ehh my little Apostles gospel, new gold flow
Blew breath into your nostrils, homie god knows
I'm the Adam that you bow to, realest alive
Ya red flag is a costume, this mobster's Jewish
The talk is useless,morning blast but you
In the bask with embalming fluid, I bomb
The rugis, dump you in the pond you sewage
I think im Big Wolf, I ain't suing
Yeaaa, get what you came for, big bad blood eh
What you scared for? I shoot the butterfly off your face
And tell Jesus Piece, smile at your wake, Yeaaa
I'm your faith you pray to Shyne when you say your rhymes
I'm the great mob ties state of mind empire state
Bow down say your grace

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Shyne]
Act like broade and I'mma act like god and take your life
I clap that, black mag off, see these rats rap hard
Till I pap pap ya'll, broad day bullets blow your snap back off
See I trapped that, hard that, smacked that raw
I ain't proud to talk about the facts, as all
In that black back, call that black rap ma
Mf po shyne, black rap god, I'm Milton Bradley
I made the game, I gave em fame, but I an't perfect
I made mistakes ,I made a lame, what's up blood
Yous a little dummy, my cheerleader, now you flip flopping
Like you run me, you know you love me, rapping like you was me
Deported from the country, now your memory got fuzzy but
I'mma take you back I'm New York like Bumpy, California like Bungee
Carter im a marter, Jewish mobster like Bugsy, seagull dessert eagle
Myalinsky like lucky, clap you, clap Puffy, feds can't touch me
Shot's are so deadly, Shyne M-F Po, oh so godly[Verse 1]
From cuttin' solid Purico to stack Fritos
Went from grams to kilos
Mac in one hand, in the other hand grands and C-notes
Game got my eyes wider than a 430 Buggy
No tellin' what the fuck I'll do for this money
Stay posted up close with killers and cut throats
The thoroughest bitches who in they pussy stuff coke
As I cook and cut coke with the bakin' soda Arm and Hammer
Palmin' hammers
Think you crazy? nigga, my clique's bananas
Takin' over with the Mafia
Hittin' niggas for they bricks like Gracias
The cockiest, it's obvious, it's me, he, who?
Confront frontin' niggas like "You want it? well nigga, me too"
What the fuck, I'm callin' your bluff, niggas act like they stopped
Makin' guns after they made yours
I'm sponsored by the NRA, DOA rules
Grin and stand over your coffin like "Hey you!"
Tell the Devil I'm comin', keep it hot
For now I got my eyes on a billboard spot
Don't stop

[Hook 2X]
Die for it
Take the stand, lie for it
Blow trial, get up in the chair and fry for it
Never tellin' or snitchin'
Rather swim with the fish'n
Mothafucka respect it, the commission

[Verse 2]
(First 4 lines with Jamaican accent)
I buy and sell bricks with my nigga P.D
Down with the team called B.B.E
Now if you want to join the team you know you must see me
Buy ya can't talk to FEDS or dick R.I.D.E
It's a cold World baby boy, fuck it, I'm colder
Animals on my back keep my warm, my armor
Frank Lucas persona, warmin' coke up in the sauna
Let me warn ya, trip against my team you's a goner
Infact it's drastic
A couple Million in the mattress
With a sick dick I say fuck taxes
Rather endulge in duct tape pig tie tactics
Crime pays
Nigga, Nine-Hundred and Ninety-Nine ways
My destiny's vague, will I survive or blow trial?
Lay shot up, Puff cryin' in denial
While my enemies smile, buried in style
Gucci suits and cufflinks
Sneakin' drugs through Heavens customs

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
POP POP POP! warning shot, who's to blame
Shyne mothafucka, don't forget the name
Stretch the Caine, to cop the house and the plane
'till my Massacre, slain
Brains hang from the window of my Range
Fuck the FEDS, 2 green and one red
Firm tight, hold the dice in this game of life
Aces suffice
Paper's a must
Fallen Angels and Angel dust
My team do dirt to avoid layin' in the dust
Bumpy Johnson portraits in my fortress
Of course it's Po
Bloodstainin', aeroplanin', Four-Hundred horses slow
Platinum cable, round table, so all the bosses know
I'm takin' over
Cause they coke got too much bakin' soda
They say money ain't everything
You fuckin' right nigga, it's the only thing
In God we trust, the Holy thing
I look into my enemy's eye
Let 'em know, "You play fly, you go out Kennedy-style."

Chorus 2x[Intro: Usher]
Baby I know we said it's best we don't talk no more
But I got to get this off my chest about all the shit I've been hearing babe I
I thought you were that ride or die
You will never leave my side
I even made you out to be the woman that I will be with for life I took in
Your kids did everything that you wanted me too
Heard about frontin' on radio and the fuse
If you were gonna tell it then you told instead of making me the bad guy
If you got nothing good to say then don't say nothing
Cause if I really start talking it'll be something
So you cheated, I cheated
So be it
We need to leave it alone
Move on

[Call waiting beeping]
[Usher] Hold up
[Operator] Hello, you got a collect call from Clinton Correctional Facility will you accept the charges?
[Usher] Yes, I'll accept it, what's up?

[Shyne - rapping on the phone]
Sittin' in my cell, head about to burst
Wouldn't be alive if I didn't shoot first
Had it made, sorry for the ricochet
But I'd be in the grave if I didn't let it spray
I never said that I was perfect
Nobody walking on this earth is
That night, I would've got murdered
If I ain't grab the ratchet and let them cowards have it

[JD]
Uh, listen up, listen up, listen up, world
Listen up, listen up, listen up, world
Uh, I gotta confess
This is the hottest remix I ever did in my life
So So Def

[Hook - Usher] (J.D.)
These are my confessions, just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions, man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all (all)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call (call)
I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do
But to give part two of my confessions

[JD]
If you got something to confess to right now step to the mic, Twista!

[Twista]
I confess about the incident when I was with a shorty in the Lexus Coupe
Ya homie said she saw me but she didn't have proof
But I knew I really should've just been tellin' you the truth
And I confess about the days
I was rollin' my Seville with the custom gold grill
I was in the field still lookin' for a thrill
And I knew it was bogus I should've kept it real
And I confess that just when I thought I could really try to get away
Or have another woman on the side
But I never knew it would catch up wit' a nigga one day
You gotta hear me girl, I done learned a lesson
If you stay wit' me then it'll be a blessin'
No stressin', it'll never be no guessin'
Cause I'm pourin' out my heart and these are my confessions

[Hook]

[Kanye West:]
Man, how did she bring it up? How did she break it down?
Man, you at the clinic? Dog, slow down that's your child
But if you keep it, then you gotta tell your girl you was cheatin'
And you went raw dog when you beat it
That's when she gon' tell you to beat it
You know it ain't y'all little secret, you famous you can't go nowhere
Cause everytime you go there, it's hoes there
So basically you and your girl over
I know when she broke the news you told her "Man, don't say that"
Matter fact like Pat don't say jack
Everytime a nigga sittin' on pay stacks
Things come up from way, way, way back

[Hook]

[JD]
Po! That's the boy Shyne, y'all
The boy on his way home, man
The boy on his way home, man!I spit and reload things
Since livin was gold rings
Fuck a piece of the pie nigga
Gimme the whole thing
I done seen death, seen less, seen more
Feed morphine to more fiends than you've ever seen
It's pain I deliver reflection
Every word like a mirror
Bigger picture I try to keep shit in perspective
Dumbs out, guns out til my time runs out
Capitalistic driving force got no remorse
But I feel shit catching up
Time wrappin' up
Shyne had enough, still I can't have enough
Something bout the engine roarin'
Soarin', wind in my face
Top down, take me to another place

[Hook]
Diamonds and Mac-10's
Tell a friend
Yellow bottles, models, hollows
Til my very end
Catchin up to God quicker
High off this liquor
Niggas come to get yours betta
Know theyre comin with ya

[Repeat]

The day I stuck my head out my mother's womb
I was doomed
Repeatin' the lords prayers sittin' in this court room
I'm cursed
We havin dreams of leavin here up in a hearse
I wonder when I close my eyes will it hurt?
I'm suicidal
Can't take this pressure or this pain
Too much for these young eyes
Real G's don't die, that's a lie
Cuz I'm dyin inside, cryin' inside
Look at me sweatin', palms shakin, hidin' inside
Drive bys and quarter ki's
This ain't what it oughta be
Almost caught a ki
Theyre tellin me that theres more to see
God listen, it was him or me
Sorry for the choices I chose
The bricks that I sold
The voices I rolled
The concrete roads
Accept me as I come into your presence

[Hook x2]

What's it all about?
Sittin in this jail house
Eleven counts, but only one count
Thats the color of my skin
Black robes, white justice
Clarence Thomas is a motherfuckin puppet
Murder anyone over 21
Through my travels I've seen barrels and gavels
Diamonds and Castles
Caught up in this solution called life
When you bitch niggas is shootin', aim right
Say goodnight to the bad guy
Last time you're gonna see a bad guy like me
I'm the last of the dying breed
Hope these words burn your brain
Find a place in your heart
Close my eyes and pray in the dark
Ask God what's the meaning?
Leavin niggas screaming
Bullet holes bleeding, I see demons

[Hook x3]

Diamonds and Mac-10's
Di-di-di-diamonds and Mac-10's
Di-di-di-diamonds and Mac-10's
Di-di-di-diamonds and Mac-10's
Tell a friend[Verse 1]
Uh uh, Uh, Uh
Ayo, mac 10s and fake friends
Lawyers little game homicide 25 with the fucking nigga face 'em
But I'm still trill, still holdin
Rollin gully until I'm froze, close in a box with a bomb in fluid
Veins pumpin ice
First some 15 keep that king pumping right
Hard white, cold cash
Hold fast, fold fast, through the city so gas
No ass
Straight head bitch, I'm one a from the feds
Fuck comma raps, same G and canna
All I got in this world is my fifth dick and nana
Gangsta mannerism lyrical vandalism
Niggas be burnin up their gums until the fucking hammers hit 'em
Who need help?
Well until then I'mma take that mac off the shelf
And hold the fucking street hostage
Blowing smoke out my nostril
Every breath is a step to a non-time in death

[Hook 2X]
I wanna know where to go
Need a place in my mind I can rest
Cause this time is running out for my flesh
Dried up, sittin' in a chair fried up

[Verse 2]
You know me; I don't need no introduction in this
Big gun, big dick, half of a meal on the wrist
Sittin in my continental thinkin' about potential connects
I live in all, just pencil the best
Parts of the live of a quintessential hustler
When I pull a slide back
Motherfuckers be hoppin' their faces don't get left open
You understand?
Shirt soaking, brain smoking left in the ocean floatin'
Shyne Po, dough, stack, y'all Rap niggas is trash
I don't give a fuck how much records you sold
Tryin' to be me
Keep it real dog, you'll die to be me
You wanna know how it feel, don't you?
To have a murder charge, took gun to the American Music Awards
And live life against stars
Doing 170 screaming "FUCK THE WORLD" (gangsta get outta the car)

[Hook 2X]

[Verse 3]
Where the fuck them niggas at? We gonna handle this beef
Turn your mic off bitch; see me in the street
Fuck peace 'til I'm rest in the dried up flesh is finish
I don't know how to tell until I'm in the morgue
Dysfunctional, highly uncomfortable paranoid
Without the extra clip (bitch), try me I'll puncture you
Had niggas waking up with wings in their backs, halos in their head like
"Ayo I'm dead"
Can a knight fucking princess Diana type
Vane wives, vane light, pen I write cold, hand of ice
They said too much for the motor mind to comprehend
Walk wit me, pause take a breath
Things ain't just the same for gangstas
Sleeping in diamond, it's fucking up the game for gangstas
While charges tryin to ring a gangsta
Through it all I maintain my gangsta

[Hook until fade]Shyne
( for the record )

Where he at, where he at?
Uhh
(repeat 3x)

[Verse 1]
Do he rhyme with a slur from some shots in his face
Or he rhyme with a slur tryna sound like Ma$e
Listen to his tape, this lil' nigga used to sound like Case
Maybe I'm juss trippin, maybe he juss snitchin
See it a whole lot different from my cell in Clinton
What I see is straight bird, straight girl
Yea you be a killa, if you could kill with words
Gotta look at the facts and not the hype
Like who got shot and who got knifed
Who keep gettin struck, but don't never strike
Hope the beef go away when the feds indict
I know yo card nigga, it's so clear
You just wanna sell records you don't want warfare
You don't wanna ride you wanna get rich and hide
These niggas would've died if they shot me nine times
Hey it's just for the record
Take this mob shit serious, please respect it

[Hook]
And there go the shots they rip 'em apart
Gushes of blood comin' out of his lungs
It's murdah bloody homicide is what they cry
When they losin' their life
When muhfuckaz ax me how I sleep at night
Pretty good witta slug and my heat held tight
Pray to God when I'm gone, this what he felt like
Finish my work on this earth nigga turn off the lights

[Verse 2]
You ain't kill Hommo cause if you did
Why you ain't get the kid that ordered the hit
You know I know, that if you live
That shit that you spit, somebody got somebody
Somebody got jumped, somebody got cut
You a boxer nigga, nobody got snuffed
Nobody got crushed, you screamin what what
Okay killa you is the slut
Think about it, enough is enough
Time to show who is who
And what is what
I mean how can I respect you
When them niggas that left you ain't none of 'em blessed you
(not 1 body)
You know where they are, where they perform
Bust yo gun, stop makin songs
Please no more ghetto quran
You got money now it's time to bomb
And that's just for the time
Take this mob shit serious please respect it

And there go the shots they rip 'em apart (2x)
Gushes of blood comin' out of his lungs

[Verse 3]
Death of perfection as I move without motion
Ain't a nigga in this game do the shit that I'm quotin'
Good look you'll never see another me
Might be sum otha g's tryna trace n color me
But I believe in the ways of old
You slit a fools throat tryna tell on PO
Rats shouldn't exist, fuck a snitch
Cut of his dick, put it on his lips
You really think I was gon' let you slide
Fuckin wit me you must be out yo mind
You really think jail was gon' make thinks right
Nigga I'll hold shop till you lose yo life
I was mindin' my own, word got back, niggas talkin bout PO
I was like oh? God must be ready for this nigga to go
Gangland, this is the mob
You got yo break come finish the job
Juss don't get the feds involved
And I'mma reunite you with yo moms
Rip
I guess this ain't juss music
Cause jail only made me much mo' ruthless (nigga)
And the bitch nigga knew this
That's why he tried to sign me to g-unit
Tell 'em how you made me offers
( I don't run with that blood I'mma godfather)
Loved on every street corner
Hurts yo heart that you don't get that honor
The feds I paid for that
10 years up top
Not 7 months shop
Walked the yard with bloods
Took the bus with cuffs
Went gun for gun
I earned my love
You, you just pathetic
You'll neva be a G, despite yo efforts
Take this mob shit serious, you gon' respect it
Thats just fo the record

[Hook]
And there go the shots they rip 'em apart
Gushes of blood comin' out of his lungs
It's murdah bloody homicide is what they cry
When they losin' their life
When muhfuckaz ax me how I sleep at night
Pretty good witta slug and my heat held tight
Pray to God when I'm gone, is what he felt like
Finish my work on this earth and turn off the lights[Mase]
Yo, just think if you could rewind time
And start your life all over again
What would you give and what would you keep?
You heard me, what would you keep?

[Loon]
Yo, yo, if I could go back, I wouldn'ta sold no crack
Wouldn'ta never put my hands around no gat
But you know Loon, bein' all hard-headed
And don't listen, even if God said it
I didn't have to stick with folks that sniff no coke
I didn't have to fix the block when shit was broke
Same cats I helped was twistin' smoke
Now imagine if I went to school, went to class
'Stead of bein' a young cat sent to blast
Sent to slash criminal's necks in half
For playin' dumb when I come to collect my cash
And cuz of that cats will respect my past, I ain't playin'

[Shyne]
If I start from scratch I'd sign with Def Jam
Nah, fuck am I saying? Puff's the best man
Plus I'mma Bad Boy, I'm more like a bad man
Put mo' nigga's in pits than Brad, man
Can't dodge bullets? Too bad, man
Shit, I'd a copped the five instead of the six
That way wouldn't of crashed and killed my cousin
Keep quiet instead of having the industry buzzin'
Do a devil's advocate style, don't let 'em see you comin'
Use the revolver when bustin' and sluggin'
That way no evidence
But fuck it, got money to be tried, worse come to worse
Who God bless, no man curse, hatin' niggas, lay in the dirt

[Mase & Meeno]
Yo, if you could start your life from scratch (What? What?)
Rewind time and still go back (It's time to eat)
What would you change in the way that you live today
And what would you leave right where it's at?

If you could start your life from scratch (What? What?)
Rewind time and still go back (About to kill it)
What would you change in the way that you live today
And what would you leave right where it's at?
Come on, come on

[Meeno]
Yo, if I could start life from scratch, I wouldn't change shit
Same gun, same clip, same dumb bitch
All Out, Harlem World, same old clique
Same old studio, same old shit
Shit don't change just because a cop took six to the brain
Meeno got a lawyer, man I'm hip to the game
You could find a gun, but if my prints ain't on that thing
What is you sayin'?
And on the same block that I get my Glocks from
You see the same cop that get popped with the shot gun
(Mysonne: Mysonne)
And at the same bodega I got my tops from
(Mysonne: Mysonne)
I give the same old money to the same cop's bum

[Mysonne]
If I could start from scratch, I'd bring daddy back
And put five in the first cat that show mami crack
I sit back and listen to them drunks on the block
Tryin' to school me with jewels, tellin' me who to watch
I killed five people, I'd let survive
And the five I took away, I'd a left alive
If I could do all it again I'd bring Virg' back
Or I switch places with him, I hope you heard that
I would have prefered that, I ain't have to starve
Pitch crack, have to rob and catch a charge
And I'd do it all again if I had to
Pitch no-win to win, and I'd be glad to
And I'd hit every target I took aim at
But I'd still be a problem, you can't change that
I'm a problem

[Mase]
Yo, if you could start your life from scratch (Uh)
Rewind time and still go back (All Out)
What would you change in the way that you live today
And what would you leave right where it's at? (And Double Up)

If you could start your life from scratch (Bad Boy, Bad Boy)
Rewind time and still go back
(Yo, I really don't know what's goin' on)
What would you change in the way that you live today
(I'm tellin' ya, I really don't know what's goin' on)
And what would you leave right where it's at?
Come on, come on

[Mase]
Yo, cuz half the cats that flip, we all was cool
And half the chicks I hit, they teased me in school
I got a baby by a lady I don't even love alot
Wish I wore three rubbers 'case the first rubber popped
But you can't cry now, milk already spilt
I had eleven friends and ten already killed
Went down south and I ain't feel the guilt
And I ain't ready to war but that ain't the way built
And for all the nights and all the fights
That I had for all this money over all these dice
All my cars and homes and all my ice
If I could do it all again, I'd do it all for Christ
Whoever thought the limelight or the super-stardom
Whoever thought there'd be a problem comin' through Harlem
Can't even chill, cats wanna make me a villian
Cats that I grew up with I gotta contemplate killin'
Nobody love me, I'm my own mister, and on my own, mister
Mama did what she could but now I'm grown, mister
Though she told me once, wish she'd told me then
Though I'm the youngest, I'mma grow to be the oldest man
And cats thinkin' they gon' win cuz they veterans
Ain't about age at this stage, man with the most cheddar win
How you live right? Every day get in bigger sin
How you say no at the door screamin' "Let me in"?
From the outside it's lookin' gooder than it ever been
But tell the truth, when I was broke it was better then
All Out, 33rd street

[Mase]
Yo, if you could start your life from scratch
Rewind time and still go back
What would you change in the way that you live today
And what would you leave right where it's at?

If you could start your life from scratch
Rewind time and still go back
What would you change in the way that you live today
And what would you leave right where it's at?
Come on, come onUh huh, Uh huh, Brooklyn Vietnam
What you, Uh yeah, Uh, Come on

Oh no, big Shyne Po
Back up in the motherfuckin heezy for sheezy
Gimme a tech that don't jam (bang bang)
I'm tryin to jucks some more grams and work this whole thing
My minds poisoned, corrupted and diseased
360 ki's
Money make the world spin
I make your chest smoke
Have your mother singing hymms
Particles of your brains up on your tims
Kiss you before I twist you
170 miles
Headed for disaster faster
I put it down right
Bustin off these rounds like
Real niggas is kings
You ain't rockin' that crown right
Harder more PK watches
Topless, bitches in cars
Only meals could heal my scars

[Hook]
Niggas wanna rhyme like shine like me
They supposed to
Niggas wanna bust their guns like me
They supposed to
Niggas wanna grind like crime like me
They supposed to
Niggas wanna mash like me, dash like me

[Repeat]

Allegations got me pacin'
Grand jury wouldn't understand my fury
For fast cars and jewelry
I could give a fuck if there's a heaven for a G
This is heaven for me
Go to trial never plea
Do a bullet and come home to the throne
I don't rhyme, I just talk about this life that's mine
I've seen niggas die, in front of my eyes
Doin' my filth
Niggas is expiring like milk
Different strokes for different folks
Just give me, different coke in different boats
Black Aristotle Onassis
All I see is crack addicts and automatics
You rap niggas is faggots
Y'all cannot be serious
I'm in coupes with gucci interiors
Airin' out your areas
Tech nines, two in the flex and shit
Lookin' at myself like
Yo, I'm the best in this

[Hook x2]

Sometimes I really wonder
What's it all about?
How many bitches can I fuck until I get out
How many ki's can I cut, guns can I bust
Wigs can I push, spots can I juck
Every single one, cuz I'm a fuckin' savage
Til I'm cremated, most hated, self made
Blood type G
All these young hustlers wanna bubble like me
They supposed to
Sippin on syrup, until I perish
Pickin' bitches off the run-way
Look forward to, gun-play
Go to sleep with one eye shut
Wake up and do the same shit
I ain't never gonna change bitch
And that's the cycle
I don't wanna be like Michael
More like Darrell Porter
Gettin' shipments at the border

Yeah, it's a wrappity wrap

[Hook x4][Intro]
Yeah, Yeah
I don't love you (Yeah)
I don't love you (You know who you are)
I don't love you no more
Yeah, nigga (Yeah, you)
Kanye West on the track, by the way

[Keyshia]
There's this girl I know, so deep in love
Do almost anything to make him see she's the one
But he doesn't feel a girl like her, he's so so wrapped up
Cuz the average girl will give him anything that he wants

He's so caught up (He's so caught up)
He won't call her, he shows no love
So she decides
I changed my mind, Ooh
(I don't love you) I don't love you
(I don't love you no more)
No no no no no
Don't waste my time (Don't waste my time)
(I don't love you)
(I don't love you no more) No no
(Bring it back, bring it back, baby)

It's the funniest thing cuz I
Know how I feel inside
But you never felt the same as I
Never, never, never ooh, yeah, miss him so much
I betcha he don't even notice
He don't even realize, cuz he's

He's so caught up (So caught up)
He won't call her (Won't even call me)
He shows no love (oh)
So she decides
I changed my mind, I don't love you
(I don't love you) I don't love you
(I don't love you no more)
I don't love you no more
No no no no, no
Don't waste my time (don't waste my time)
(I don't love you) I don't love you
(I don't love you no more) Don't

I'm so over you
I got no more to give
I gave it all to you
And you couldn't handle it
And I don't care if you come back to me on your knees
I just don't love you no more

I changed my mind

[Shyne]
Speeding on the highway, gangsta lean
One sixteen, full steam, nah mean?
Bitches on my jock cuz my flow was hot
And they spot the watch filled with rocks from a block, huh
When the light hit, strictly fish skill
Fuck that light shit, a noise out the garage, double pipe shit
I'mma deal like hey yo ma, I know you likes this
Capital S
Capital H
Capital Y
Capital N
Capital E
Whatchu all know about G-force
SL's with automatic doors, ha
Flow sick, no shit, roll six, head crack
Walk the street with my chain out for frontin'
Fuck y'all niggas walking 'round like y'all sayin' somethin'

[Ad lib until fade][Shyne]
Geah, uhh, uhh, uhh
Uh-huh, like that
Geah, uhh

Ten bricks nigga in the air, hold tec
It's that motherfuckin nigga named Shyne
Nothin but cum for these bitches, love none for these bitches
It's that motherfuckin nigga named Shyne

What's my motherfuckin name? Put a bullet in your brain
Leave your shirt stained, guns and cocaine
It's the best of a V&E
I'm like homes in Charlie's Angels, y'all never seein me
Heavenly indeed, measure me a key
My moms was a virgin when she had me
I rock flows, top O's, better yet, sell it wet
Tape ki's to bitches, I need the riches
Scene switches, big bitches, to hide snitches
Smile for the feds as they take pictures
It's the young G speakin; leavin niggas leakin
Shots repeatin; around the clip somethin bound to hit
Y'all motherfuckers was counterfeit
Eat a dick and choke, as I sniff coke
Shyne pro, watch how you pronounce the shit
G'z up, hoes down while you motherfuckers bounce to this

[Hook: Shyne]
Before your dog you're dyin and bustin your iron
Take the stand you're lyin, it's ok
If you cook it, cut it, watch - flooded
Hit niggas in public and bitches love it, it's ok
If you high right now as they play this in the club
Lookin for somethin to fuck, it's ok
If you startin with her, it's ok
If you snotty with him, it's ok

[Shyne]
With so much blocks in the N-Y-C
To burn 'em all down is kinda hard for me
But uhh, somehow, someway
I keep takin over motherfucker's gates like every single day
It's, the, rap, singer
Slash, coke, crack, slinger
Sling crack sling smack sling dick to dingbats
That try to pussy bootchie coochie, I'm in that
Kingpin raps, I spit 'em, fed NARC's, I dip 'em
Bentley and large rims spinnin, the shit is sickenin
My rhymes, my flow, I got all the symptoms
Rinks and links and trips to Harry Winston
Born sinner; think that model bitch I'm with is slim?
You chances of seein me are slimmer
I was through with it, before y'all knew what to do with it
Put my finger in the ground and turn the world around

[Hook]

[Shyne]
From hip-hop to them hot blocks
It ain't never gon' stop; well maybe for three days
But then I'll return, more blacks to burn for more yea
Get them (??) sittin up on Broadway (geah)
Livin the life, ridin on Twinkies
Thirty inch rims spinnin, bitches is grinnin
Roscoe on my left, wonderin where the pussy at
So I can scheme the dope, get the pussy and float
Big things, live from the Empire State
Where niggas, live in fear of a 8-48
Don't owe my favors, jewelers deliberate
Shops have me spinnin like you was doin a figure eight
Gun in your mouth bitch, got a bitter taste
Push up hard on the arms - uhh, bitter face
Guerilla pimpin indeed
Shit I'm like a perm;
Somethin every girl in the ghetto need

[Hook] - 2X[Intro - Shyne]
Yeah
Shyne, gang land, murder inc
Haha
Alright, turn the beat up
I see you, ok!

[Verse 1 - Shyne]
Alright, turn the beat up
I see you
Ok

Master P's diamond face on your sleeve
Def Island, waist petite
Alright, Jimmy Choo shoes on your feet?
Shoot, right!
Slide inside the spider
I know you tired of guys who try to lie
To slide inside you
Forget about that, lets go
Forget about rap, I'm Po!
I mean really, I been gettin money
Since niggas is rappin for me
Its fast as shit
Coz you dont look like, you got your head right
I just hope you can give head right
Breezin through Eggshell headlights
New York is mine, relax your mind

[Hook - Ashanti]
Oooooooooooooooo
Can't nobody
Do them things we do
And can't nobody
Touch me like u do
Can't nobody
Love me like you do
And can't nobody
Be like me and you

[Verse 2 - Shyne]
This is Me!
I'm mostly respected
Ring down to the necklace
Some hoes say I'm sexist
Coz all I wanna do is stuff coke in they breastes
Sit back, lift stakes, count money
In the zone, roll that dope
Like this, come on
I need a prada chick
To take this dick, and take this script
And flick this shit, base this shit
We can go shopping and buy some things
Up in Harry Winston ma, try some rings
How you feel like you is Princess Di
So much cuts on your wrist
They could draw suicide
No lie, you ain't heard?
Extensive trips, expensive whips
You ain't seen nothing like this
Not in your life
If I ain't that nigga, shit you fuckin right

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Shyne]
Who gon' cop them hoes? (Po)
Who gon rock them clothes? (Po)
Who gon' pop them fros? (Po)
Well I'm glad you know
No need to ask who holla'd
You ain't nada, me alotta

See you niggas in hell
Now lets prevail, feds on the tell
Just post bail, a million in cash
Now you know that ain't rappin pimpin
Please believe that
Body smoked like we was just ganna clap em' up
That ain't enough? then why you backing up
Niggas talking real greesy on them rap records
Look I'm strip you naked, take your necklace
Give it to my soldiers like "hold this"
Fuck you nigga you could never fool this
But anyway back to business
Lets play
One CPW come through
I like girls that like girls
That like girls that like furrs
Ok[Verse 1: G. Dep]
I got enough flows to spit, the coldest shit
Give you what you supposed to get, to close ya lip
I got enough O's to get, and hoes to hit
Try to stick ya nose in shit, get froze and stiff
Talkin' 'bout load ya clip, and O's you flip
When you ain't holdin shit but droze and dick
Roll the spliff, take the toke
You either gettin cake or broke, you can stay awake or croak
Take a note, take a vote
By a landslide, tell ya man slide or I'll shake ya boat
Take ya toast, this rap shit I make the oath
To get cake or estates by the lake or boat
Bad hoes, insatiable
See the snake, eat steak, leave faith they hate to go
Yo, its to late to blow
Ya run around pay for hoes, that's why ya paper low

[Hook: Shyne]
We them niggas with big guns and big dicks
Flood ya block, and keep it gangsta
We them niggas with big guns and big dicks
Coke them rocks, and keep it gangsta

Drop the top, and keep it gangsta
We them niggas with big guns and big dicks
Wylin, stylin, keep it gangsta

[Verse 2: Shyne]
Shyne Po, I keep it gully like im supposed too
In a hard top something frontin
I must of fired, died, came back as a rapper
Scarface, smith and eights, in my life after
Bone crushers on my hip, cause shit get thick
In the mist of killas tryin to get rich
I'm two shells from hell tell 'em I'm made for this life
District attorney, tryin' to indict
But I don't give a fuck, cause I'mma do me
Till them hollow points, rip through me
I was born to die, live for what?
Plush slut, bucks, guns and dust
Spent late nights in the kitchen, wishin'
Watchin the pot boil, mixin, sniffin
Keepin America high, and why wouldn't I?
Gangstas don't talk, we beat the case and walk

[Hook: Shyne]
We them niggas with big guns and big dicks
Flood ya block, and keep it gangsta
We them niggas with big guns and big dicks
Coke them rocks, and keep it gangsta
We them niggas with big guns and big dicks
Drop the top, and keep it gangsta
We them niggas with big guns and big dicks
Wylin, stylin, keep it gangsta

[Verse 3: G. Dep]
Yo, I got wild fed to earn, lead to burn
Slot time, dead ya turn
Lotta cats gotta wait til they dead to learn
Pastor Rev. Sermen, ya learnin'
I'mma wild card to play, guard ya pay
Goodbye's hard to say, cause ya moms to pray
Ya lookin odd and gay, I'm modern day
I'mma rep till im hard and gray, pardon me
I'mma make it hard today, bombs away
Launch grenades, at your entourage and blaze
Calm ya rage, I ain't even on ya page
Ya see-thru like lingerie, guns in a large array
Hit the door, kick the raw, spit that law, then spits some more
Everybody hit the floor, I'm quick to draw
Flows like hittin bitches raw, to sick to cure

[Hook: Shyne]
We them niggas with big guns and big dicks
Flood ya block, and keep it gangsta
We them niggas with big guns and big dicks
Coke them rocks, and keep it gangsta
We them niggas with big guns and big dicks
Drop the top, and keep it gangsta
We them niggas with big guns and big dicks
Wylin, stylin, keep it gangstaThey say that I'm a euphemism for a new religion
Praying that my comrades all get out of prison
Stuck in Clinton, in a system where they’re thinking that I did it
Deserve to be born in the first place, ‘cause of my pigment
Darker than the Caucasoid complexion kind of different
On a Harley David is King David saying my tehilim
Pistol in my waist still wrapped in my tefillin
On a camel with the Arabs cause Ishmael is my sibling
I’m on my own thing, yes, Moses
I don’t part the sea, I fly a jet across the ocean
Yeah, God the one that wrote this
So make sure that you’re listenin' ‘cause I’m just an instrument
I’m from the block where ain't no scholarships
Guess she only knew the things I do make my momma sick
And Larry Hoover was my tutor
Now I made teshuva from the King Crown of Judah

Beware that you’re not listening to the king of Judah rhythm
Running over pigeons in my Lamborghini engine
Try to make a billion, middle finger to you critics
I'mma always be the illest, whether mobster or Hasidic
Don’t care about no image, bro, I’m runnin' buildin' bridges
For the people desert equal cats, who they were on the pavement. (?)
Trayvon Martin, Martin Luthor King they wanna kill us
Star of David in my visions, ya'll be knowing who the king is
Yes Moses, I’m on a boat, get shot skin ya
Hundred million on the ocean
Yeah, black diamond, red roses
Whoo for Africa, oh, hail the Ethiopians
I’m all about philanthropy
Money for the Po', big talk, can you answer me?
Smoking on a cuba, lying in a cougar, king crowned Judah[Shyne]
Let's go
Shyne Po, bust pipes get right
Bang, stop, roll head throw the dice
White Air Force Ones, monies in rubber bands
America's number one dope man
Racin through the city with Uncle Paul and Diddy
Hennesey frontin, lookin brock and gritty
Tryin to meet somethin, so I can skeeet somethin
Five with it, slide with it, P hit it, I hit it
What's it all about?  Servin yay every day
We roll, send a foe mix those and bulletholes
Livin in vein, ice flowin through my veins
I'm light in the change, 'til they put it in my brain
Bulletproof sedans, rich bitches
Throwin me kisses, takin my pictures
License to kill, I ain't with a lot of talkin
Try conversatin from the coffin

[Hook 4X: Shyne]
All my niggas wildin, let me see your hands (WHOA-O-OH-OHH)
All my bitches stylin, let me see your hands (WHOA-O-OH-OHH)

[Shyne]
Just tossed the bail so now I'm free
Bout to get in the kitchen to cook a key
Who you know that could double up like me?
The hottest nigga up in N-Y-C
I'm that nigga comin through, doin what he does
Rocks in his ears lookin like light bulbs
Desert snubs, pierce your skull
Criminal mindstate, I bring sale weight
I just happen to rhyme great, pipelines and gates
In fifty-nine states, raisin the rates
Got my mind right, like Al Pacino and Nino
I head to Capitol Hill to kidnap Janet Reno
Monster flow, words droppin and shockin
Gun cockin and poppin, somebody call Cochran
Boats of coke at the port
Import, export, have my bitches transport

[Hook]

[Shyne]
Get pussy in a bed full of dough, nose full of blow
The feds is in town I gots to get low, uhh
Pants saggin low, get at bitches like yo
Hop in the truck bitch let's go
No time to waste, nine in my waist, ready for war
Anytime anyplace, fuck it just another case
One life to live and I'mma live (??)
Gettin mine, bottom line, we'll be cuttin dimes or rhymes
Cold hearts, shootouts and fast cars
'til I'm behind bars or in the graveyard
Blast a foe for capital the master flow
Is masterful y'all vaginal
Bling'n hard, bracelets to the necklace
Lookin like effect (?) the flow is infectious
Pocket fills, multi-million dollars deal
Flip more bricks than Tetris, what you feel?
