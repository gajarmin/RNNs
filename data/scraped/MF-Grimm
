[Grimm] You know when you're gonna come in?
[DOOM] Nobody will never ever, ever, really, really know
Because the more you know, the more you know that you don't know shit!
Niggas'll never run out of shit!
So much shit, so much scripts through here, niggas never run out of shit...
[Grimm] It's another roller coaster ride

[Verse 1: MF Grimm]
Walk the path of Jesus, witness if Hell freezes
The mind teases reality, crack the pieces
Nothing eases; being chastise with blood baptize
Guys revise, acknowledge past lives
Statements will be made, acknowledge me
My mind is Heaven's gate so enter me
My mind is the gate to Hell, so try to flee
Both gates look the same, which will it be?
Demons scream from thought process
Enter semen, child born, stress
Body want to sleep but the mind can't rest
Measure pleasure through financial progress
When it come to currency, love is nonexistent
Foes multiply, friends become so distant
Some hope you die, backstab in an instant
Foes I despise, disguised as allies
To sabotage, camouflage
Loyalty is lies
To see God, look into my eyes
To see the Devil, then you look into my eyes
(As I rise from Hell's equator...)

[Hook]
Cause I'mma slow it up, speed it up, slow it up, speed it up
Metal Fingers feed beats, Grimm Reaper eat 'em up
Speed 'em up, slow 'em up, speed 'em up, slow it up
Brainsick, tick, tick, tick, MF blow it up
Slow it up, speed it up, slow it up, speed it up
Metal Fingers feed beats, Grimm Reaper eat it up
Speed it up, slow it up, speed it up, slow it up
Brainsick, tick, tick, tick, MF blow it up

[Verse 2: MF Grimm]
Take air, compress it, bless it
Mix loops like Ku Klux
MF don't give two fucks
Nigga, quarterback blitz, popped, quickly fumble
Leave game with concussion, seeing stars and mumbles
This happens to any emcee that wants to rumble
Dynasties destroyed like Carringtons and Colbys
Noise, reduced, MF thinks in Dolby
Chop that ass in half like Obi-Wan Kenobi
Greatest of all time, God straight up told me
Greatest of all time, the Devil even told me
Icicles on surfaces of sun, we livin' coldly
Prophets be phony
And we attack, we switch like the Wu Tang symbol
Still kill Jack even though quick and nimble, plain and simple
Pick niggas off while they ballin'
And die old like Stalin
Yes, Death, I hear you callin', I accept collect
Human sacrifice, must pay respect
We catch reck, nigga, we catch reck
And... we gonna... gonna...

[Hook]

Boom
MF Grimm, MF DOOM[Intro - Bashton the Invisible Man]
I met this kid he seemed righteous
Represented knowledge
Yeah, him and his brother they was real smart
But then his brother died and he was taken in by a grand master
And from what I hear this kid Sambo was a snake
A rat, he stole shit and ran away to another state
Microchip bitch

[Verse 1 - GRIMM]
I don't deep fry friends
Grimm Reaper nuke 'em
Hearts don't mend
Brothers turned to enemies
Nigga, enemies I eat them raw
Nigga, MF GRIMM is god of war
Parole done, see you on tour
Millions get paid, lets see who make more
Master water
Cause man is mostly made of it
Spit fire consume by friends compete for oxygen
Freeze deepness of minds
Then skate on it
Roast fire proof emcees with bad warranties
War is a part of me
Prison hardened me
Demons tried to murder me
Pistols always poppin' me
Lead convicts my flesh
But God pardons me
Revenge, was turning descendants
So God, pardon me
Put yourself in danger
Running with a mouse
Metal turned to braces
Punch you in your mouth
Zev Love X, used to be merry
The mask took control of you
Like Jim Carrey
Megalon, tap him in the jaw
Knock it off him
M.I.C. got to put your mask in a coffin
Mos Def, De La soul
Roots can't revive you
When the bullets start flying
Who's gonna hide you?
Rhymesayers, Stones Throw
Nature Sounds sign you
Make peace with you?
Zev I I tried to

[Hook - Bashton the Invisible Man]
You can hide behind the mask
But see through like glass
Thought you was the truth
But your style's like ass
Cut-throat bitch
Man you got no class
Little black Sambo
Shouldn't talk trash

X2

[Verse 2 - Mez]
Midgets into crunk
Monkeys in a cage
Murderers in a cut
Fucking you up on stage
Tell them about the time
That Gunn punched you in the face
Basically you was hating
And then you ran away
You ain't a man, you a character
I bet that mask make you feel a lot scarier
Cause man to man is your doom
Like we're parallels
M.I.C. will see you soon at your burial
Listen Vicky you not goons, you cartoons
Your hype man is not Grimm, that's not him
What you speak is not true, that's not you
Your team's weak, I'll pop them, then pop you
Smog made ya mask
Jet Jag made your name
M.I.C. gave you life
And we can take that shit away

[Verse 3 - GRIMM]
I didn't wanna get at you
You know this is true
One thing that stopped me
Was Lord Dihoo
But now you're being
Disrespectful to me and the crew
Now I gotta do, what I gotta do
M.J. did articles, she got your name hot
The mask was made for you by Lord Scotch
X-Ray gave you studio time when in town
Rodan and Megalon, them brothers held you down
Evil jay, had you paranoid like a clown
Jumped off stage and ran when Kong came around
We looked out for each other when you lived uptown
On the cover of the EP, but look at us now
Chess is life, we haven't played off late
But even on the cover, I put your ass in mate
We been through so much, Zev you was close to me
Used to come trough your house, buy your ass groceries
I wrote the whole treatment to your MF video
With Adam Lounge and Ricky 'Kid' Scotchno
Hundred thousand dollar bail caught up and I called you
Fired my attorney, you helped me get a lawyer
You took me in, let me stay out in Atlanta
Facing 15 to life, we bounced out to Cali
You made sacrifices, recorded on the run
We bust our ass, and got Ibylis done
I made a mistake, told the press you hold dough
I see now its my fault, they didn't need to know
I apologized to you, I thought we let it go
B.B. King's, New York, together did a show
But look at us now, once again, here we go
Money wasn't worth it, it turned us into foes
Whenever you had beef, your beef was mine
I took a life for you, put mine on the line

Doing songs with RZA
That's funny shit
I remember you told me
That he bit Tick, Tick...
You said Ghost was whack
You didn't like his style
Two-faced and three-headed
Bitch I pull your file
New food poisoning
You vomit for a while
You started some shit
Now you sitting on a pile
Metal face, tin foil
Walk the green mile

How could you ever diss M.I.C
Yves St. Lerock yes R.I.P
How could you ever diss M.I.C
Big L R.I.P
How could you ever diss M.I.C
J. Black R.I.P
How could you ever diss M.I.C
Subroc R.I.P
How could you ever diss M.I.C
K. Nit R.I.P
How could you ever diss M.I.C
T. Collins R.I.P
M.I.C

What the fuck happened to you man
You fell the fuck off man
Niggas used to love you, motherfucker
Come home man
Come home, Zev (Come on)
Don't let them niggas brainwash you man
I know your fans love you man
They love you
You getting brainwashed[Verse 1]
MF, special herbs, fingers in the spice rack
A little bit of my love, sprinkled into gingerbread
I wonder, American Hunger gotta feed feds
Do bids, CO's searching under bed
MF worldwide, see no Carson Daly
I'm the original, researching like Alex Haley
All's well in Hell, listen GM Grimm's fairy tale
Get slick rewrite, script turn horror flick
But murder scene for the police, we gonna edit it
Bloody screams, violence, all seen in 3D
Loud dreams, silent screams, slash mic and vocal chords
Execute hype man, now you gotta eat alone
I pass, cause Grimm is on a fast
You're a charmer but your armor shatter like glass
Being me ain't easy, it's a difficult task
If you look through my eyes, you'll rip 'em out your head
I had fair warning about the streets, I didn't heed it
Fuck God, going to Heaven I didn't need it
Devil by nature in my heart I really knew it
Started a war up in Heaven and I blew it
Not good with taking orders, so I took the dare route
But ended up getting aired out
I give props because it was a fair bout
I give props because it was a fair bout

[Hook]
Now I'm trapped on a planet of pain and perpetrators
That you call Earth but I call Hell's equator
Trapped on a planet of pain and perpetrators
That you call Earth but I call Hell's equator
Trapped on a planet of pain and perpetrators
That you call Earth but I call Hell's equator
Trapped on a planet of pain and perpetrators
That you call Earth but I call Hell's equator

[Verse 2]
Perc is cursed, you hear it in his verses
Voodoo doll, sticking pins in an iPod
Pulling strings in industry, watching puppets dance
Niggas I burnt, watch 'em turn to the man
Time flies when alive, quickly turn OG
But niggas still can't fuck with me
I don't tour, so when you see me you see me
No radio and I'm never on the TV
Still get dough, music's a drug, I move weight
Mad is the flow so wack niggas hate
My heart got cold but my mind spit heat
The world's on my shoulder but I'm not on my feet
Chariots of fire, gunshots from the wheelchair
Nigga I'll leave you there
Emcees are counterfeit, three dollar bill shit
Some have gimmicks, others you just feel shit
All in they lyrics, others be bullshit
You know what, fuck them (Yeah fuck them man)
I'm tired of talking about these niggas
Trapped on a planet of pain and perpetrators

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Time gap, three years, better do your homework
Not a stranger to murder, seen many niggas die
Exterminate my life, so many tried
Black Nikes, white stripe, drink grape Kool-Aid
To be an MF, you're donned by me
MF Grimm, real name Percy
C-E-O, last name Carey
My boys are the white noise, my crew is scary
Day By Day Distribution got it on the smash
Those who challenge get knocked on they ass
Grab niggas with my mind, across the room get flung
Mastered styles of Wing Chun with tongue
You can be the best, I'm trying to feed my family
Plus I'm paranoid, please don't fuck with me
I'll kill you, straight up, this is reality
This ain't a made up urban documentary
I thank the creator for the woman who was sent to me
My life, my legs, didn't know what they meant to me
Until I had to lose them both and regain them
Spirits all around me I try to explain to 'em
Go ahead and put the chorus back

[Hook](Is it yes?)
March forward if you feel that you're blessed
(Is it no?)
Step back if you don't want to go
I lead the way, follow me and I promise you will live forever
All soldiers of fortune, down payment might be death
Our blood it is costing

I lead by example in this war with my sword
So if our blood is shed it's mine before yours
But if there's blood shed I'm the first one to spill it
The battlefield's a graveyard and God's gonna fill it
Keep your eye on the prize, we rise up for glory
Those who survive go back tell the story
If I fall in battle, please tell mine for me
And let them all know you were last one who saw me
Let the people know that I died like a leader
I lived the same way so everything is even
If it cost me my life then I spent it on freedom

(Is it yes?)
March forward if you feel that you're blessed
(Is it no?)
Retreat if you don't want to go
I lead the way, follow me and you will live forever
All soldiers of fortune, down payment might be death
Our blood it is costing

(Is it yes?)
March forward if you feel that you're blessed
(Is it no?)
Step back if you don't want to go
I lead the way, follow me and you will live forever
All soldiers of fortune, down payment might be death
Our blood it is costing
So kill with stronger will, send enemies the bill

On the road to riches speed bumps are worth a mil
Potholes and ditches might get soldiers killed
Roadblocks, obstacles, get hard to steer
Optical illusions of gold ain't real
Prayer for the roadkill, they got a raw deal
Slayed on the battlefield, slow swinging steel
Chest wide open, so fate now sealed
Scars and memories, awkwardly they heal
We take their territory, make 'em all hail
Shake 'em from their cloud in Heaven, give 'em all Hell
Break 'em off a little something, crush 'em all whole

(Is it yes?)
March forward if you feel that you're blessed
(Is it no?)
Step back if you don't want to go
I lead the way, follow me and you will live forever
All soldiers of fortune, down payment might be death
Our blood it is costing

(Is it yes?)
March forward if you feel that you're blessed
(Is it no?)
Step back if you don't want to go
I lead the way, follow me and you will live forever
All soldiers of fortune, down payment might be death
Our blood it is costing
In the game of war both sides will suffer losses

Chariots will be seized, stolen will be horses
Burn down houses, men killed in front of spouses
Many die crucified but there were no crosses
Spilling blood and guts make soldiers nauseous
Always keep composure, when in doubt be cautious
Followed instructions won't face destruction
Faith in our creator, that's our protection
March to victory, forward is direction
Maintain campaign, murderous selection
In the valley of death so many now are resting
History will be made, so I ask you a question


(Is it yes?)
March forward if you feel that you're blessed
(Is it no?)
Step back if you don't want to go
I lead the way, follow me and you will live forever
All soldiers of fortune, down payment might be death
Our blood it is costing

(Is it yes?)
March forward if you feel that you're blessed
(Is it no?)
Step back if you don't want to go[Hook]
Scars and memories, Memories and scars
I look up in the sky and I wonder where you are
Can't nobody diss my nigga, Damn, I miss my nigga
Memories and scars, Scars and memories
Talk to me kid cause I need some guidance please
Can't nobody diss my nigga, Damn, I miss my nigga
Scars and memories, Memories and scars
I look up in the sky and I wonder where you are
Can't nobody diss my nigga, Damn, I miss my nigga

[Grimm]
I'm writing this letter from Lenox Hill Hospital
I'm so sorry, that I missed your funeral
But silhouettes of you are trapped inside my head
As I lay in ICU hangin on wishin I was dead
Tryin to convince someone to pull the plug and let it end
I lost my best friend, plus I'll never walk again
Now that you're gone, it really don't matter
Becomin a star, becomin a superstar
God threw rocks at my glass heart and it shattered
I look up in the sky and I wonder where you are
Cryin' like a baby, starin' at your picture
I'm mad at the world kid, I'm wishin I was with ya
The world is on my shoulders now the weight is kinda heavy
I loved my little shorty but my little shorty left me
In a few minutes time, with the help of a nine
I went from king of the rhymes to the victim of crime
I gotta stop, and wipe my tears G
Ayo J, respond, let me know you hear me

[Hook]

[J.Black]
You will walk again, J. Black won't letcha down
As for rap, represent, and snatch the fucking crown
Fuck to most these rappers, cause you know they're not your friends
So don't wait for no battle, bring the noise straight to them
I don't give a damn if the nigga is ya idol
Implant in his head that he better think survival
I don't give a fuck about his crew or the fame, each one of them niggas step to them and blow em off the frame

[Grimm]
But J I want the days, when we were just chillin
Ridin around in cars, dressin nice, and countin millions

[J. Black]
Those days are over for us so understand, you my man, but it's time to step forward and represent the fam
Like I'm Jesus Christ, I'm payin for our sins
Take these niggas to war for me, let the games begin
I want you off the street cause the street is not the move
Don't let me die for nothin, test your skills, show and prove
Niggas think they ill, but show em you are iller
In the past yo we killed but wasn't raised to be no killers
Money and murder's hand in hand, it goes with territory
Manhattan war stories, what a price to pay for glory. Cash Rules...

[Both]
Everything around us

[Grimm]
But everyone around us in not down with us
They plot, scheme, surround us
There's jealousy, envy, niggas wanna hurt me
I can't move my legs, J so that shit just hurts me
Right now I'd be better off dyin G
I don't think that I can function in society
Cause I paid the cost, you paid the cost
The family paid the cost, and now I'm feelin lost
Because you went away, And now my skies are gray
I don't know what to feel I don't know what to say
I don't know what to do I need you to impinge
My life is like a door, hanging off the hinge
I try to improvise, and go with the flow
But to my surprise, the flow is so slow
I'm really confused, advice you have to give
I'm not afraid to die, but right now I'm afraid to live

[Hook]

[Grimm]
I don't know my title so I'm a little sad man
What's the difference between a genius and a madman?

[J. Black]
A genius is exceptional, he breaks down the whole
Mad men are not men, they do have a goal
To be a genius or a madman is in your mind...

[Grimm]
But is it possible for the two to intertwine?

[J. Black]
Yes, when a genius uses poems, just to focus on crime
Greed, or make nuclear bombs all the time

[Grimm]
In this materialistic world is there any kind of hope?
(Nope) Will Catholics ever have a black Pope?
I write rhymes like Riddler
List them like Schindler
Alot of religious figures on this planet are just swindlers

[J. Black]
What do you see?

[Grimm]
Sight beyond sight, those of twilight, the afterlife
A new world is what I like

[J. Black]
You don't like Commandments but just do them

[Grimm]
Aight, but when you talk to God again could you give these questions to him?

[J. Black]
They can't be too long, cause he's a busy man
So tell me about six, and I'll relay em if I can

[Grimm]
God, (one) Why's my mighty nation lost?
(two) Why'd you let Jesus Christ be put on the cross?
(three) Why's my people poor and oh so sore?
(aiight) In harlem all I see is funeral homes and liquor stores
(four) Why'd you let the Indians get used and abused?
(five) Why'd you let Hitler crucify all the jews?
(alright) some races will never see the best outta life
(true) it's like you made a big ass test outta life
I got love for you God, but could you explain to me
(six) why you took my legs and J and dished out so much pain to me?

[J. Black]
Don't stress it, kid. It's life, and not even death can seperate the loveTook a trip out to Hersheypark, it was strictly business
Wasn't out there looking to settle
I met this girl and she was so beautiful
Asked her her name and she told me Gretel
I said Gretel how are you, I'd like to get to know you
My name is Gingy, there's so much I could show you
Yankee hat backwards, look very dapper
I had a pinky finger ring pop fresh out the wrapper
She liked what she saw, her eye caught the jewels
How you make your living Gingy, what do you do?
I said I'm into candy like Willy Wonka
Work down on Wall Street, trade a lot of chocolate
Couldn't tell the truth, had to think quick
I don't work on Wall Street, I move it by the brick
M&M's by the bag never that's loco
Swiss Miss is my muse, she smuggle cocoa
God works mysterious, tricks up his sleeves
It's funny that I met you, I was about to leave
But I'm glad that I stayed, it's nice to meet you
You look so sweet Gretel, I could just eat you
She said I melt in your mouth not in your hands
I said Gretel I'm about to bounce so what is your plan?
She said chilling with my girlfriends, waiting for Hansel
So he can drive me home, I'm hoping he don't cancel
I asked her if Hansel was her lover
She said nah silly, Hansel is my brother
In that case tell him he don't have to do that
Don't worry I'll take you back
She said I don't even know what to say
I live kinda far, I hate to put you outcha way
Nah it's no problem, don't even trip
Just wait right here while I go get the whip
I pulled up in a six hundred gingerbread Benz
Chocolate interior, you should've seen her friends
Car candy coated, they couldn't understand
They said you better catch that nigga while you can
I told her I had a sweet tooth, she was eye candy
My blood sugar's low, I had to keep her close to me
I said your perfume smells like caramel
Come to my house, you could ride my carousel
She laughed, she said swell
I'm serious, I really got a carousel
You really got a carousel?
I really got a carousel
Damn trading chocolate, Gingy you're doing well

Come back to my house
You will love it
Come back to my house
You will love it

I live deep in the forest where the trees are the thickest
Not worried about neighbors, five hundred acres
With milkshake lakes, mountains made from cakes
She said cool, sounds like fun, take me there
While I was driving she was playing with my hair
When we pulled up you should've seen her expression
She said wow, it's a gingerbread mansion
Walls made of peppermints, floors made of licorice
Jolly Rancher chandeliers, you are every woman's wish
Bed made of chocolate, pillows filled with cotton candy
Sheets made of Juicy Fruit, spent a lot of dough shopping
Lick of pure butterscotch had to get her tipsy
Then she got the whipped cream, sprayed it on Gingy
Shhhhhhhhhhh
She said how many licks do it take to lick
To the center of a Tootsie Roll in a Tootsie Pop
We got wild with the hot fudge, freaky with the ice cream
Gretel was a nice treat with a cherry on top
Ain't no party like a gingerbread party
Cause a gingerbread party don't stop
Ain't nobody shaped like Gretel's body
Cause Gretel's body shaped real hot

Come back to my house
You will love it
Come back to my house
You will love it
Come back to my house
You will love it
Come back to my house
You will love it
Come back to my house
You will love it
Come back to my house
You will love it
Come back to my house my house my house[Hook]
Shit ain't never gonna change (Fuck it!!!)
Time to load the clips (Then we take 'em to war!!!)
Niggas wanna flip (The we take 'em to war!!!)
Break a nigga proper (Then we break him some more!!!)

[MF Grimm]
I represent the murderers and felony offenders
Who even bought time out to get these legal tenders
(Surrender) Nah, I'm goin out with a bang nigga
Fuck Pataki I gotta do my thang nigga
Forty-four mag, bustin into action
Brains left in particles, fragments and fractions
Grimm, the money stacker, heat packer
I'm lurkin, I'm waitin, attackin like a linebacker
Fuck what you heard, crime pays
And always, unorthodox, I hold my pistol sideways
We kill crews, hearts go numb
And if retaliation comes then yo fuck it, it just comes
(Yo who you?) I'm Dr. Death motherfucker ever heard of me?
Close your eyes, cross your fingers, time for surgery
I'm already dead, so nah, you can't murder me
Cause quantities of entities enter me evilly

[Hook]

[B1]
Since I murder for hire, rapid fire's what I require
Makin niggas perspire, so send a message through the wire
Cause violence is contagious, it got me bustin gauges
The '95 Larry Davis and I'm wettin niggas for wages
Queens is the home of 1, the known felon
And ain't no tellin, when I'mma crack your fuckin melon
For the right amount of chips, I spit clips and hit whips
Leavin niggas bloody, the leather seats is where the shit drips
With the pound-seven, I be creepin, rockin niggas while they sleepin
Shots repeatin, leavin faggot niggas leakin
When I cock back the iron, niggas is dyin, marchin to Zion
Cause the pound-cake, roars like a lion
Word son, niggas be collapsin, cause my weapons is
Ready for action, makin your heart catch contractions
In the underworld, shootin gallery niggas lose calories
Cause my salary's based on fatalities

[Hook]

[Kool G. Rap]
Here I come to get some motherfuckin wreck but first I gotta
Umm vest check, uncheck, clip one check, clip two check, I'm set
So let a motherfucker move a muscle
When I tussle they'll be piecin niggas back like fuckin puzzles
Cause Kool G. Rap is known for bringin mad noise, a bad boy
When I was younger always carried guns, I never had toys
Grimm, gimme the infrared and semi and I'm puttin red dots
On niggas foreheads to makin motherfuckers Indian
You got beef? Go get yourself a wreath, because it's murder
Cause I put holes in my beef like fuckin White Castle burgers
So now I gots to run up on a clown with the fo'-pound
Cock back, rock black, gun a nigga down
I see em, he's comin out the fuckin colosseum
And hopped into a BM, shit!
Put in my clip and then I dipped into the ride that my man had
Parked on the sidewalk, then we start to glide
I'm rainin on him (faster nigga) oh yeah we're gainin on him
(Oh shit he's with somebody else) fuck it, put his brain on him
Boom boom, no survivors, lifted the nigga out his seat
When they find him, he'll be a backseat driver
But I ain't finished with the trigger yet, I'm lightin up a cigarette
Bang Bang!!! I left the other nigga wet
It's G. Rap baby, you know me, you try to hurt this
I split your fuckin top and leave a fingerprint on purpose!M.F.! M.F! (x7)
MF Grimm is hard as hell
Murder anybody, I don't care who you tell
I bust shells, they all fell
World domination started, sitting in my cell
Potential, kinetic, only time tell
Pressing up units, for more to make 'em sell
Messing up universe, fractal cause chaos
Communicate with the dead, Grimm is in a seance
Don't take it personal, this is strictly business, kid
Nosy niggas wanna hang around, we killing witnesses
We're into torture, have you tied up, hollerin'
Bleed, let you die slow, in heaven, hoverin'

Face my adversaries, every confrontation conquered and
Faces of my adversaries, mutilation, severed and
Traces of my adversaries exist, just like they never did
Other cases involving Percy Carey, yes, I did a bid
? what the Feds feel, war, pistol-whipping pigs
Old toupee type, Grimm is probably twisting wigs
Not a stranger to getting hands dirty, clothes bloody
Either my enemy or a close buddy
We come to terms, it's the life we lead
Some burn from it, Lucifer indeed
They can't separate, their wants from needs
Some learn from it, and try to teach the seeds
A new breed, coach, sees the ? power
Others throw salt in the game, let em ? like they're sunflowers
Hail, gun power, sparks - I sneeze
Your style stinks and I'm Febreze
I'm ever flowing so I rhyme for breeze
Then, willing, I rhyme for cheese
Manhattan, murdering, lay you down with ease
Manhattan, clam chowder, a thousand degrees

Niggas nowadays, take your eye off, you're a goner
If I think you a snitch, then I throw a cup of water on you
Hit team, fly through, kill you on your own corners
Second team, flight crew, mow 'em down, that's how it scatters
Some have kids, but when it's on, it doesn't matter
Defeat that, they'll hunt you later, the ones now that pitter patter
Hit baby formula, Similac, crack splatter
Fox Five, hovering, kill reported, take camera
Gun fire, ducking it, hunted like Al'Qaeda
Strictly with my mind, choking niggas like I'm Darth Vader
Stick me on a crucifix, reappearing days later
Fuck Jacob's Ladder, times change, use the elevator
Life is a struggle, so day by day's the entertainment
Day by day we make our moves so competition hit the pavement
Ghetto politicians, recognition, move the crowd, I'm waving
Shaking hands and kissing babies, maybe they'll assassinate me
Fully automatic, rapid fire bullets fill me
Six million dollar man, stronger they rebuild me
A hybrid: Michael Corleone, with the perspective of Michael Concepcion
So if you fuck with me, then nigga, it's on
With the clock, moving palms with Viktor Vaughn
I make it rain blood with Megalon
Brothas in the street know that Grimm's a Don
Yes, a made man, trapped in the wasteland
They know my mind's a refinery, so they keep an eye on me
Change life for comrades, before they all die on me
I sacrifice mine, before they all die on me
Double oh seven, tuxedo niggas spy on me
Unavoidable, death will occur
Niggas, left shaken, not stirred
On video surveillance, Grimm is blurred
Put me under the jail, that's what they'd prefer

I don't give a fuck, tuck my gun in my waist
Tie my belt tight, so it stays in place
Get out my chair, crawl up the steps
No elevator, so they don't feel I'm a threat
Believe me, I'ma get 'em, and that you can bet
Think it's a prank, nothing to see but a knock
As he opens the door, I'm on the floor with a Glock
Homemade suppressor, so the noise won't start
Most in his face, a few in his heart
Without a trace, I slithered down the stairs
Upper body strength, I'm back in my chair
Cause when I'm mad, nigga, I don't care
Talk shit from far, I'mma leave you there
Reach for your gun, it's done in vain
Grimm ain't the one, you'll be left in pain
Bullets pollute blood, infect the brain
I move fast, I'm curious with shifting lanes
Many get jealous cause money be stacked
Every time they try to kill me, I come right back!

[ -Doc, Doc! Here he comes again, whadda we do?! ]
[ -Surrender! ][Verse 1]
10 years later
I'm blessed and still breathing
But I gotta tell you Jay things are not greater
As you know many more lives are terminated
So even more scars accumulated
Memories engraved deep, not faded
Dead came pass, no Sunday shaded
But I know without you Jay I'd a never made it
10 years later

[Chorus]
Thinking about you brother all the time (and I be)
Talking to you most of my rhymes
Things are not better Jay feel me
More scars, more memories (and I be)
Hoping that the babies don't suffer (and I be)
Tell 'em that MF love ya
Clutched in the hands of poverty
More scars, more memories

[Verse 2]
Traveled through the years, jealousy
Became a cancer, to the family
Quest for money divided us
Feels like they forgot you died for us
Feels like God just lied to us
Life on earth is death to us
Not saying I can't be wrong
Just saying about this I feel strong

[Chorus repeats while Grimm continues talking]
To the mighty Subroc
Big Al

10 years later
Yves St. Larock
KK
And to all them other ones who left this earth too soon
Rest in peaceLife be fooling me, society is screwing me
It's entrapment so I see no future days
But the dead is schooling me, my thoughts are jewelry
So hopefully longevity my creativity is appraised
Everytime I flow, whether fast or slow
I illustrate and complicate like paintings from Van Gogh
I cock my brain back like a TEC-9
I bust rhymes off, I let my mind shine
Intellect orbits morbid, rhymes antifinite
Scrabble minds like Milton Bradley everytime that I write
You're matter, I'm space, matter in space is weightless
Scatter when chased, duck motherfucker or be faceless
Verbal gangbanger, world changer, black Jesus
The bacon ripped to pieces with my murder thesis
Paralyzed I kick ass, telekinesis
That's physical communication through terror brain sensation
Sometime I feel like death is getting closer
The streets is so cold but hot like a toaster
The electric chair is here, yo Como try to stop it
But that punk ass nigga Pataki put the plug back in the socket

Push the red button, light the match
Blow this motherfucking world up and let's start from scratch
When World War 3 come, it's time to leave
Omega rewind back to Adam and Eve

No bygones are bygones, streets turn to Saigon
I'm capping 'em before they take me out
That shit ain't happening
FCC, break the codes that I'm rapping in
Phones tapping in, cameras in the crib are mapping in
Fuck the Klan or any man who hide behind politics and bibles
To stop me from survival
No longer do I contribute to genocide like I did
I chop trees; I plant seeds for the kids
But when this war come I'm flipping wigs
Power to the people, fuck these evil pigs
So burn to ashes, in God we trust
I turn the wild to a pile of dust
And I halt rotation, world stop turning
Mind missiles, Earth starts burning
Bone gristle, traces behind
One more time, erase mankind
Create from dust, trust insight
Unlock darkness, shed light
Beam touch soil, heat magnification
Volcanoes boil, next step vegetation
Reproduction, subtract clouds of gloom
Beauty born through destruction and doom
MF Ebola, quarantine the vocal room
Locals die soon, once inhale my deadly tomes
I'm killing billions to make room for me to get up
Then I raise the dead up, I speak for those that's fed up
But won't let up, crucifix, birds picking at me
Tapes seized like I'm Nixon see
Rikki Tikki Tavi, snakes hissing at me
Life's a bitch, bitches blowing kisses at me
Niggas get jealous, get the guns spitting at me
And to God I pray, but oh the shit he say
You wouldn't believe it in a million years (No)
You'll be horrified, crucified, stoned by peers
As the lynch mob cheers[Intro]
The Downfall of Ibliys
Yeah, got this way too clever, you know what I mean?
It's the ghetto opera that explains the whole joint
Yeah, take a ride right now, you know what I mean?
See how it goes, yeah
And so the angels bow, all of them together
But not so Ibliys, he was proud, and Ibliys was one without faithFriends are brothers and enemies are twins
You love to hear the story again and again
Design so violent, make sure we don't win
Fifteen minutes each to crash and burn
Exercise freedom of speech, they'll trash your existence
Even skin bleached, you're faced with resistance
So scared niggas shut the fuck up and keep your distance
Instead of switching frequencies and focus on the mission
Trying to increase fan base by ass kissing
Stupid motherfucker got shit on nose
Condoleeza's in the White House posing like she Mona
People of sun turning polar
Ice Age burning again frozen solar, solid
Like dogs got people of color, collared
Killing each other for a diamond
Pardon me, I really meant to say a dollar
Mothers all they can do is holler
Because genocide is killing future scholars

When they're hungry they just eat us up
American Hunger
Hate our kind, mad want to beat us up
American Hunger
These chains on our legs they slow us up
American Hunger
If they could they would just blow us up
American Hunger
When they're hungry they just eat us up
American Hunger
Hate our kind, mad want to beat us up
American Hunger
These chains on our legs they slow us up
American Hunger
If they could they would just blow us up
American Hunger

Rap beef fronting like the rowdy
Fight set up like Ralph and Harvey
Beef byproducts taste like chicken
Need to stop bullshit, focus on children
I am a warrior no stranger to a killing
I know we're not perfect but who's willing
Stop genocide, put together millions
Brothers need to rise combine and buy buildings
Get kids to school because we're losing
Think shit is cool, the streets they're choosingDon't you worry about
There's no need for doubt

[MF Grimm]
This is a tale about the mother of a dummy
Moving weight on consignment then stole the money
He bounced on 'em, quarter mil, living scott free
He's gonna set it up then send for his family
He was wrong, information got it all
Have gun will travel, so they made a house call
Kicked in the door waving the 44
Pops tried to stop it and they blew him to the floor
Put another in his chest, in his face one more
His wife screamed (Oh Lord no no no no no no)
It broke his mother's heart
A little to old, not fast enough to run
Grabbed her by her hair then they beat her with a gun
No remorse whatsoever, to them the shit was fun
Punched her in her mouth and said bitch where's your son?
Tell us what we want to know, I promise we'll be done
They cut her in her face and then said bitch where's your son?
We don't get him, you're gonna pay for what he did
Checked all the rooms just in case the nigga hid
Went in the closet, found his wife and his kids (Oh Lord no no no no no no)
It broke his mother's heart
Insult to injury, terrible scenario
Tied up his wife with a wire from the stereo
Ripped off her clothes, they all had they way with her
Took the gun, then they did away with her
Baby was a few months, the oldest five and started crying
They didn't even care man
They asked him if he knew where his daddy's at
So scared, the little kid couldn't talk back
They caught a little wreck, snapped the kid's neck (Oh Lord no no no no no no)
It broke his mother's heart
Motherfuckers are crazy, next stabbed the baby (Oh Lord no no no no no no)
It broke his mother's heart
It's a bad feeling in your house with total strangers
And they rearrange it, turn it to a torture chamber
Can't identify the face covered like a Power Ranger
Fucking with they money put his family in danger
Everybody in the house is dead except her now
Lighter fluid and a match, her face is getting burned now
They won't kill her yet, that would be too easy
Chopped off her pinky finger, she started screaming
In shock, got worse, saw she was bleeding
Kicked her in the mouth, broke 'em all, she was teething
Stabbed with an icepick, having trouble breathing
She said Lord save me, when these niggas leaving?
She saw a white light as the room got dark (Oh Lord no no no no no no)
They cut out his mother's heartThere's no other reason to do this man
I mean everybody can be the greatest emcee in the world
Or the baddest or the toughest
But when you're capable of building and making something
And helping the babies, or family
That means more than platinum, mean more than Grammys
That's everything

[Verse 1]
Elders knew I was a talented baby
Pick 'em some numbers and then they would pay me
Sesame Street before photos they say cheese
Five years old, my friends all see me
How did he do it, cause Percy's on TV
Snuffleupagus, Bert and Ernie
Five already I make my own money
Theme of show, days are sunny

Growing up knowing I was a talented baby
Growing up knowing I was a talented baby

[Verse 2]
My move to Elm Street was not funny
Freddy Kruger place was shady
Tragedy changed me
No sleep, nightmares go crazy
Turn into reaper and nothing can faze me
Growing up knowing I was a talented baby
Killing emcees and pushing up daisies
Life's a movie and I'm Scorsese
My pain is in panels and enemies frame me
Family disown me, laugh and shame me
People trying to play me
Convicted drug dealer is what they named me
Out of prison but still they don't free me
Praying to God that someone come save me

Growing up knowing I was a talented baby
Growing up knowing I was a talented baby

[Verse 3]
Others caught out there sleeping, but not me
Open fire, can't believe they got me
Legs not moving, lead paralyzed me
Gotta keep rolling, hope life surprise me
Angered with brothers, thinking they homies
Finding out later these people are phonies
Former disciples, I hear them say bad things
They form is of birds who love to sing

Growing up knowing I was a talented baby
Growing up knowing I was a talented baby

[Verse 4]
Call me a murderer in paper, oh that stings
Police hunt, deep cover, they set stings
Angel without wings
Wire is worn pretending they mic strings
Liars born fronting like they king
Scavengers look at them looking around for something
Holding a cordless connected to nothing
All a facade, they really just bluffing
Pushing up hill, I'm huffing and puffing
No longer hatred, I'm focused on loving

Growing up knowing I was a talented baby
Growing up knowing I was a talented baby

[Verse 5]
Arthur Ashe play tennis against me
KRS-One passed microphone to me
KC Ceja sign me to DC
Ron Wimberly grab pen and he drew me
Made history with first triple cd
Battle Super Nat they said he defeated me
Puffy was judge, I knew he would cheat me
Learn from loss now no one can beat me
Freestyling, freestyling, listen, no that's not me
Battle on wax it's known no one can see me
Life is hard, wouldn't want you to be me
But life is beautiful, it's great to be me
Now I live happy
The love of my life, she finally got at me
Angel with wings, she came down and saved me
Talking of marriage and also having a baby

This song is dedicated to all the people who tried to break me
Your plan failed
And as you sit back and listen to this song
Wondering if I'm coming to get you
Don't worry about it, I'm not even going to touch you
You're not even worth it
And as far as I'm concerned
The best revenge is to become successful
So this is where you and I part ways
Here's to success
Have a nice lifeM.I.C
M.I.C
M.I.C

[Verse 1]
The Grimm Reaper will reap so don't sleep or make a peep
I'm deep I got a shotty and it pumps like a jeep
As it pump you weep, you're up shits creek
I'm not pumping De La Soul, I'm pumping little creeps
With heaps and heaps of lead, like sheep they're lead
To their deathbed, fed instead of making bread
Then left dead, ripped to shreds, twist and hanging like dreads
I rest heads with bed like Club Med
Get wise, realize that sometimes hypnotize
Emcees who my rhymes and lines that they memorize
Dropkick dipsticks, built like thick sticks and toothpicks
I kick ass, quick and sick like a karate flick
Drop you like a brick you tick
Flame broiled, I either fry the Burger King on mix
Thought you dope but you're shit, you dick I stick
Niggas up cause I'm a lunatic, my victims are handpicked
You wiped off like lipstick, seasick or homesick
Pretend I'm dead then beat that ass with a broomstick
Say one word and yes your ass I'll chase
That's not gas that's fear in your face
After words no handshake, you soft like cheesecake
Tough like beefsteak but sweet like shortcake
A young star by far that's up to par
No matter who you are, I'll be ready to spar
Cause the mic is a crowbar, my rhymes are solar
Classy like a jaguar, the microphone all-star
Grimm's a die-hard, chill on the boulevard
With my bodyguard, who's big like a saint bernard
It's a war I declare so beware it's unfair
Cause you can't compare gold to silverware

[Hook]
I destroy!
Get the fuck out my path you interfere with me
Go against me nigga, you don't want no deals with me
I destroy!
Get the fuck out my path you interfere with me
Go against me nigga, you don't want no deals with me
I destroy!
Get the fuck out my path you interfere with me
Go against me nigga, you don't want no deals with me

[Verse 2]
Souls are dead to my demented sentences
Relentless pain, no Novocain I drill like a dentist
Couldn't prevent this, hard like cement tape
Musical weight, leave you hanging like drapes
I crush microphones like they were grapes
On tour, I make a lotta papes
But the words you heard I mend designed and shape
I bent this track, sent this wack apprentice
Ass right back, to the drawing board
He was a joke to the rhyme overlord overlord overlord
So catch the wave like coke, I just float like a surfboard
Stomp in the streets, I tear up clubs
You reach for the mic and I leave you with nubs
I fry brain cells like a bag of chips
When the rapper try to flip or even give me lip
Catch me at my maddest, that's when I write my baddest shit
Then I lock like a pick
On the paper, sick 'em, another victim
For the musical raper, rhyme ripper
Style stripper, nine hipper
Sharp like a nail clipper
I'm bigger than both of the dippers
In very dapper, I'll go deeper than flipper
But when it come to rappers rappers rappers
Huh, y'all just little whipper snappers
So what up, what up, punk shut up!
Or get your jaw broke like Razor Ruddock
Aw shit, I'm at it again
Chasing motherfuckers like I'm Rin Tin Tin
The final chapter no more laughter
As I bomb your ass just like the day after
No nuclear warheads cause instead
All rhymes are launched by the kid who's fed
We're infrared to pinpoint the joint
Or the place of the person I chase face
So walk and don't try to talk
When I snub the stalk
I don't discriminate, Grimm Reaper hates
All emcees who grab the microphone
Yes I dislike them whether they're friend or foe
So yo, I start to throw deadly body blows
Eight punch combos I turn stars into John Does
So if you see me at a show you better G-O
And tiptoe your ass out the fucking door
I film my shows with a handy-cam
Before I go on I sip some brandy and
Sprinkle sweet rhymes like the candyman
And I cripple emcees, I make 'em handyman
I destroy
Get the fuck out my pathChorus:
May, I, kick a little something
To show niggas I can flow and get the party pumpin
May, I, kick a little something
What you gonna break 'em off Grimm a little somethin

Day by day drama
Cats dream about gattin Manhattan Dali Lama
Golden Light I'mma
Pray rain, retreat but come calmer
One time too low, mad flow unibomber
Almost died having me, Thank you to my momma
She named me Percey Carry, that's Universal
Known for showin love and bustin pistols
Street affiliated, graduated, played with plastic
Explosions, exact in fact more drastic
Impact crack scrambled eggs made with autos
Richter scale 7, highway heaven
News at 11, filled yo shoe and ya crew all deaded
Hard like pork rhine, remote swithches
Securin they minds on bitches
Wearing yo shoes and stealing yo riches
Save my life? Those are dead man wishes
Take my life? Sleep with the fishes (????-cy)
Track bassy, cripple devil, verbal level heavens spacy
Retire, emulator
Flow like water, spit fire
Call smoke purple hazing
You half dead, but half man, half amazing
Um......
They whole purse disperse
Got 'em rewritin rhymes, rippin up they verse
Cursin, cause his whole crew head boppin
Catchin attitudes cause, niggas ain't stopping
You shocked? Fuck you expect, Grimm is rockin
Manhattan keep on makin it, got bitches shakin it
Money in circles, 360 rakin it
U N I verse, in God we trust
Drive by's in traffic, high when I bust
Suppressor on nozzle, no one hear us
I love those who sleep, and don't fear us
Have 'em dead at the light, slumped to the right
More we go, you checkin in tonight
Family stressed out, loved ones tight
Goin back to Cali, to take this flight
Love the Big Apple, 'n I'mma take a bite
Day by day for my, life I fight
To God I pray that, someone might
Hear my skills, hit me with mills
N' pay my bills, so I don't kill
Sittin in prison and I'm facin life
Changed the game, snitches live so trife
Judge actin like I just fucked his wife
In his bed, and drank his wine
And she gave me head so he's givin me time
Inside of here I'm going out my mind
Bouncin off brick walls, sun don't shine
Push ups and chess help me unwind
Cuz I'm in a bind and I can't rewind
So I hit fast forward, hope I get sign
A friendly game of baseball on (??????ine)
My bat had too much tar from pine
Tap umpire jail gave me a fine
30 days in the hole, in the dark I dine
Dreams of bein free and go claim what's mine
Dreams of bein free and go claim what's mine

Repeat Chorus[Verse 1]
I fell from grace on my face
Still I rise up, greater
Whatever they expected from me, check it
I'm not as dangerous as I used to be
Which make me more dangerous than I used to be
I'm focused
I care a lot more than usually, teach the babies
Make me not care about losing me, sacrifice
Should I comply with ways and save breath
Or challenge the beast and fight it to the death
Illusions of power create drunks of men
So grapes of wrath are stepped on for the future
Aging fine wine takes some time
But some get impatient, they eat 'em off the vine
Smoke signals float overhead, don't catch the line
Too busy looking down, forgetting that they brown
Friends fear for my life, watch yourself Grimm
Whoever wanna take it, bring it on then

[Hook]
Enemies wanna kill me but they just can't touch me
Through broken glasses, life looks so ugly
Just a bastard, America don't want me
World of hatred, The Creator still loves me
Enemies wanna kill me but they just can't touch me
Through broken glasses, life looks so ugly
Just a bastard, America don't want me
World of hatred, The Creator still loves me

[Verse 2]
Blessed to see another one, this could be the day
Luck is on my side, everything goes my way
But if I make the wrong move, it could be the last
Fearing death in the future keep you living in the past
King want me dead so now he flip his lid
A kid, I hid and did a bid in pyramids
Got in tune with myself, learned that I'm powerful
My mind lift me up the day that my body fell
Professor X, over matter I do it well
Verbal is the voodoo, a verse is the spell
Levitate through Manhattan, maneuver around the hate
I strive to be a better man, won't be compromised
Bigger problems bigger man, God increased my size
Sight beyond sight, truly my eyes is on the prize
Solar rays phase, snowmen run city
Sun goes down, they wonder will I go down with it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Some try to test and question our divinity
MF Grimm, MF DOOM, Serengeti trinity
I lead the way to victory, blood will be the trail
No matter who we face, believe me we'll prevail
All hail[Gonzo talking over various Grimm samples]
Yo, check this out
All you fake ass, party ass niggas out there
That keep biting my man's shit
We gonna keep it real for the 94
Monsta Island aight
All you bitch ass niggas, get the fuck out of Monsta Island aight
Yo Grimm, set that shit off like this

[Grimm, Verse 1]
I can either help or kill like radiation
Imitate Kuwait, in the motherfucking train station
Mutilate like Charles Manson
I'm cuttin bitches and I'm givin 'em stitches like Marla Hanson
Come and test me from Brooklyn to Bahamas
Battle the best and digest like Jeffrey Dahmer
Mad motherfuckers murder military methods
Priest of death, pass my blessings with the Smith & Wesson
Punk ass rappers, I'm stickin up
Straight wicked(?) rush, terror stricken cause you're butt(?)
I hang with CM, Kurious George, and ??
In the streets I have a rep for pullin spirits out of bodies
I show no fear, I'm not giving in
So change your address, cause you're living in oblivion
Emperor of evil, impress my competition
'Till my last breath, the best destroy recognition
Death's the definition, rappers' fame is reduced
They're scared I'm loose, and now they wanna call a truce
They hate it, I made it, they waited
And hesitated, but now their brains invaded
Anger been in this(?), you're hearing this
You're fearing this, ass I'm tearin' this(?)
You get dissed, so you're pissed
Cause ass I kick, always get last licks
The money devil of ??, all I roll is 666
Musical mace, eyes puffy like a ??
Disgrace crews of two, and make 'em break up like 3rd Bass
I cause disasters, I am the master
Turning little bastards into fucking Casper
So put your name on a tombstone
Cause when you try to kill me, I refuse to die alone

[Hook]
A lot of niggas wanna be me, but they can't be ( but why?)
Because there's only one ??
Frontin like they all that, but they just bums
What they tryna snatch kid? (Crumbs)
Frontin like they all that, but they just bums
What they tryna snatch kid? (Crumbs)

[Verse 2]
Violence, plus intellectual analysis equal military thoughts
Fights with other thoughts is my favorite sport(?)
Quantities of entities enter me evilly
He who's dumb enough to battle me, not drastically, and has to be
In the world of fabrication, demonstrations of confrontations commence annihilation
Let's pretend we're both guns, and make this shit erratic
I'll be the revolver, you can play the automatic
Automatic flip scripts, revolver show loyalty
Each gun is die able, but only one's reliable
You shoot fast, but in the end you jam
Then I click back, and turn your brains into spam
Grimm is the man and I demand my recognition
Even if I have to blow your ass to spiritual submission
I heard somewhere niggas is scared of revolution
Revolute against the Reaper, and get pulled from evolution
I was shot a few times, and I died, and ??
Now I got beyond life, and attack the supernatural
Seven shots fired, seven shots went in me
Grimm was Jesus Christ, and to the concrete cross they pinned me
A lot of hardcore niggas, I just figure they're imposters
Rapper's war games, and Grimm's brain name is Joshua (?)
So if you want to battle then I gotta say
The only winning move against Grimm Reap is not to play

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
As I follow Apollo, gotta prophecy in music
So up the raising sun, and transform it into poetry
Stalking the shadows of the human mind
And leaving weary niggas better fear me when they hear my eerie theories
On the rap scene, me you can't compare
Punks like to stare, but they wouldn't dare
I'm givin niggas nightmares on the streets of Elm
Step into oblivion as you enter my realm
I turn "boom bap" into "boom bip"
My mind's on reverse shit, so you can call me Mxyzptlk
Quantum lethal universe is different time and places
Surrounded by an oasis of dead faces
Will I die in a peaceful way, or go all out like Carlito's Way?
Fuck it, gotta live Day By Day
Peace to my nigga by the name of J
Styles automatic, with skills of Eddie Futch
Stick shift rhymes, I burn 'em out like a clutch
Primitive rappers ass kick or they either(?) spark
Cause you're a dinosaur, sent to a Jurassic park
The Reaper's rude, drop your ass to your knees
If death was food, I'll be handing out free cheese
Sit back, relax, smoke some scama
Niggas screamin battle, but they brain have no armor
En garde, grab the mic and take your fighting stances
Like they take chances, we can battle for advances
(Fuck this wheelchair) I'm in a wheelchair, but still makin money
Cause I got my murder buddies wearin hoodies, who get bloody
The rap Boba Fett, if you rhyme then I want ya
Mental bounty hunter, of hardcore fronters
Some sleep on the Reap, like I'm not nice
But I don't freestyle, cause my style cost a price
Tiny temptations of termination, no hesitation
Retaliation to all imitation, creations was making duplications of my innovations
So whatcha want niggas? Bring it on (Bring it on)
I'll blow you out the sky like Captain Kirk do the motherfuckin Klingons
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Graze ya with a razor, watch ya jugular bust
Grimm is the one that flew the cuckoo's nest
"Fuck the world" is written on my chest

[Hook]

[Grimm talking]
I represent Monsta Island (Ya don't stop)
I represent Monsta Island (Ya don't stop)
Big Vito's in the motherfuckin house
Punks in the motherfuckin house
Ya don't stop
Bring it on niggas
East coast to West
Grimm Reaper is the best[Verse 1: MF Grimm]

When it come to war there will be some casualties
Manhattan is the game of death
And cops are referees
I'm dwelling on my life like I'm Kevin from the wonder years
A lot of friends died
And I'm trying to hold back the tears
Want Beer?
I'll give them bloodshed instead
Cause so many died I have to pour keg
New York is hotter under the collar
It's so easy to die but It's hard to make a dollar
Screaming from the dessert is the eagle
Make it holler
Plus we got the street sweepers, so run in fear
If we can't have no money then the block is getting cleared
My family call me MF, that mean Mad Flows
You better buy my album cause yo Grimm ain't with no shows
Nah kid, I be with a cutie in my house
Want me to do a show? Then you put up twenty thousand
(Word, fuck promo ?)
Mad Flow only rhyme for double digit dough and two bottles of Mo
I really do think earth is undercover hell
Cause rain never drops only blood and bullet shells
But yet still my fam remains strong
Life isn't short, death is so fucking long
What would I do? Where would I be? without my f**king crew AKA my family
Some pass away, now they living up above
But not even death can separate the love
Half the crew is black, the others are Hispanic
Showing unity and causing havoc on this planet
Some pass away, now they living up above
But not even death can separate the love
Friends from the cradle to the grave
Hoping for old age, but this stage of age never came
And um, where I'm from
Die young
But we all know real niggas never die
Once I mediate, breath in release steam
Subconscious take a stroll
Quantum leap through my dreams
I put my nine on the shelf and try to mediate
And find myself below
I still can't find me, life's a tape
Stop, play and just rewind me
Push record and let me cry
I pray to god as a child but as a man I only pray to die
Holograms of horror through headphones
A virtual reality my brain is the dead zone
Rappers in my hemisphere prepare the end is near
The reapers here to interfere, flip a nightmare like the keys
Chop dreams down to ounces, feet to move the mommys but the human head be bouncing
I'm living in the stress box every day's the same
(whatcha want kid?)
I want the money f**k the fame
What would I do? Where would I be? without my f**king crew AKA my family
Some pass away, now they living up above
But not even death can separate the love
Half the crew is black, the others are Hispanic
Showing unity and causing havoc on this planet
Some pass away, now they living up above
But not even death can separate the love

This is dedicated to...dedicated to all my motherfucking brothers on the streets. [x3]Going out to my nigga Rob Swift
For having faith in me
I'mma show niggas East Coast is back
And all that other shit is dead
I represent for Manhattan
I rhyme for the dead
Time to set it

TEC-9 dreams and MAC-11 wishes
Infrared is beaming on the target making sure there is no misses
Your funeral, you know who's blowin' kisses at your widow
It sound fucked up but your widow's doing ditto kiddo
Get with me, on your death she didn't dwell
You're living up in Heaven but I know you're mad as hell
No one knows I killed you except you
(And we all know that dead men can't tell shhhh)
Homicides in the dark, can't trace the bullet
Pick up the shell, dug the lead out your fucking heart
Shaking gates in Heaven because she's fucking me
Swinging on God cause you need Heaven's keys to get to me
Your spirit ain't shit to me, kid step to me
You're history, ghostbuster ass kickin' victory
When it come to hardcore I am epitome of evil
So don't pull stunts like Knievel
Brainstorm

Violence in the belly of the beast won't cease
I've packed a piece since lease was born permanently creased
Far from weak, not too many better
Hardcore is color black but I shine like patent leather
Food for thought, hush, eat my words with you mind
Emcees are grapes and grapes are crushed to wine
A deadly breed, no fad or bad seed
You never forget me like the Jews will never forget Hitler's bad deed
Brain cells are blown like a bike tire
In nights escape the mental hell by running through the verbal fire
I wanted friends to see me at my best
But I lost a lot of friends in violent crimes in the process
My attitude's a mess, I like drama
Forget about my problems, I smoke a lot of scama
I have few things to live for but even more to die for
My niggas out the street is what I strive for

To die unheard, I won't grant it
Six feet under this planet, unknown, I can't stand it
Platinum don't mean shit when you're perpertrating someone else's life
And they life ain't legit
How we livin'?
We livin' day by day
Ain't no tellin' on Earth how long you get to stay
Microphone friction with diction in speakers
Cause feedback, verse bleed black, when you attack
Or, repeat heated words I speak
Weak beat, strong vocals, no question the beats delete
Grimm's voice is elite
Everyone loves a winner but what happen when a winner meets defeat?
Nuclear thoughts (boom), radiation , termination
Clouds of mushrooms spell doom to all creations
Fuck World War I or World War II see
Cause rappers gotta deal with World War me
And World War me equals World War III
We can rhyme or either fight kid
So what it's gonna be?

This is going out to my nigga Jay Black
You my nigga, always will
To my nigga Big Vito, Kirk, Punk, D Smooth
Salim, my whole family
Y'all know what time it is
All these niggas out here frontin'
You know what time it is
Real niggas do real things
Real niggas are here, so run in fear
Fuck youYo (come on man, let me hear it)
Put the kids to bed
Cause this rhyme is not for them (come on man, let me hear it)
I'm representing for men (Come on)

[Verse 1]
TEC-9 dreams and MAC-11 wishes
Infrared is beaming on the target making sure there is no misses
Your funeral, you know who's blowin' kisses at your widow
It sound fucked up but your widow's doing ditto kiddo
Get with me, on your death she didn't dwell
You're living up in Heaven but I know you're mad as hell
No one knows I killed you except you
(And we all know that dead men can't do shhhh)
Homicides in the dark, can't trace the bullet
Pick up the shell, dug the lead out your fucking heart
Shaking gates in Heaven because she's fucking me
Swinging on God cause you need Heaven's keys to get to me
Your spirit ain't shit to me, kid step to me
You're history, a ghostbuster ass kickin' victory
When it come to hardcore I am epitome of evil
So don't pull stunts like Knievel
Brainstorm

[Hook]
Do it for the kids man, the kids
I rhyme for niggas in the street or locked up that's doing bids
Do it for the kids goddamn it
I rhyme for brothers walkin' dead and for those who left the planet

[Verse 2]
Violence in the belly of the beast won't cease
I've packed a piece since lease was born permanently creased
Far from weak, not too many better
Hardcore is color black but I shine like patent leather
Food for thought, hush, eat my words with you mind
Emcees are grapes and grapes are crushed to wine
A deadly breed, no fad or bad seed
You never forget me like the Jews will never forget Hitler's bad deed

[Hook (x 2)]

Do it for the kids man, the kids
Peace to my nigga Puck
Do it for the kids goddamn it
G Squeeze
Sorry (come on man)
Sorry shorty but you can't hear my album
Cause it deals with stuff you shouldn't hear
And life in the streets is what your mommy fears
Streets in the past brought a lot of mommy tears
You know
You know what I'm saying?
To hear my album you gotta ask your mommy first
But don't get mad if she say no cause in verses there's curses
I'll do a radio mix just for you
Still curse but flipped in reverse
And I'm out shorty (come on man)
No, I said no! (come on man)
You don't stop (come on!)
No shorty (come on man, one line!)
Let's go watch the Prince of Bel-Air (one line!)
No one nothing (one line)
One no (one line)
No (one line)
No, I said no (I said yeah)
I said no (I said yeah)[Verse 1]
MF, special herbs, fingers in the spice rack
A little bit of my love, sprinkled into gingerbread
I wonder, American Hunger gotta feed feds
Do bids, CO's searching under bed
MF worldwide, see no Carson Daly
I'm the original, researching like Alex Haley
All's well in Hell, listen GM Grimm's fairy tale
Get slick rewrite, script turn horror flick
But murder scene for the police, we gonna edit it
Bloody screams, violence, all seen in 3D
Loud dreams, silent screams, slash mic and vocal chords
Execute hype man, now you gotta eat alone
I pass, cause Grimm is on a fast
You're a charmer but your armor shatter like glass
Being me ain't easy, it's a difficult task
If you look through my eyes, you'll rip 'em out your head
I had fair warning about the streets, I didn't heed it
Fuck God, going to Heaven I didn't need it
Devil by nature in my heart I really knew it
Started a war up in Heaven and I blew it
Not good with taking orders, so I took the dare route
But ended up getting aired out
I give props because it was a fair bout
I give props because it was a fair bout

[Hook]
Now I'm trapped on a planet of pain and perpetrators
That you call Earth but I call Hell's equator
Trapped on a planet of pain and perpetrators
That you call Earth but I call Hell's equator
Trapped on a planet of pain and perpetrators
That you call Earth but I call Hell's equator
Trapped on a planet of pain and perpetrators
That you call Earth but I call Hell's equator

[Verse 2]
Perc is cursed, you hear it in his verses
Voodoo doll, sticking pins in an iPod
Pulling strings in industry, watching puppets dance
Niggas I burnt, watch 'em turn to the man
Time flies when alive, quickly turn OG
But niggas still can't fuck with me
I don't tour, so when you see me you see me
No radio and I'm never on the TV
Still get dough, music's a drug, I move weight
Mad is the flow so wack niggas hate
My heart got cold but my mind spit heat
The world's on my shoulder but I'm not on my feet
Chariots of fire, gunshots from the wheelchair
Nigga I'll leave you there
Emcees are counterfeit, three dollar bill shit
Some have gimmicks, others you just feel shit
All in they lyrics, others be bullshit
You know what, fuck them (Yeah fuck them man)
I'm tired of talking about these niggas
Trapped on a planet of pain and perpetrators

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Time gap, three years, better do your homework
Not a stranger to murder, seen many niggas die
Exterminate my life, so many tried
Black Nikes, white stripe, drink grape Kool-Aid
To be an MF, you're donned by me
MF Grimm, real name Percy
C-E-O, last name Carey
My boys are the white noise, my crew is scary
Day By Day Distribution got it on the smash
Those who challenge get knocked on they ass
Grab niggas with my mind, across the room get flung
Mastered styles of Wing Chun with tongue
You can be the best, I'm trying to feed my family
Plus I'm paranoid, please don't fuck with me
I'll kill you, straight up, this is reality
This ain't a made up urban documentary
I thank the creator for the woman who was sent to me
My life, my legs, didn't know what they meant to me
Until I had to lose them both and regain them
Spirits all around me I try to explain to 'em
Go ahead and put the chorus back

[Hook]Nowadays you can save the world without ever leaving your living room
How on Earth?
Let me give it to you
Nature’s ways cause us to consume
So it’s obvious we gotta be prudent
The 3 August ones wud haw at our movement
Their sovereign should be taught to our students
Impart them all to embark and construct their own, with none but an awl to produce and a pall to remove
We shall not be moved
We’ll have to make a stop at the tombs, before you stop what I’m doing
Or is this cop shot you just wanna pop shots take a pot shot at a human?
It can be confusing when you’re losing
Just don’t lose it- stay resolute
Are you talking to me in Chinook? Jargon
The 10th incartion of Vishnu? Garbage
Yeah it’s called Kalki the destroyer of darkness
And I think it’s up to you to spark it
Employ your inner truth and market
Anoint it smoothly like talcum, it’s enjoyable to do and keeps you from drowning-under water you need to be buoyant to stay on top, sound strong like olifant
I flaunt a lot of font and a fond love for our daughterz
Fawn love for our fauna, all is important
Consider all encompassing order 1wish is all love
Deliver all alms (writ psalms/grip palms) calm qualms and problems
I want a Padma like a marzipan bar
I’m dim like an umbra
Awaken from my slumber
Free immortal songbird, of mortal suffrance
I’m screaming Ombre Ombre
With no remorse or maudlin
Don’t see me off course
Won’t hear me ofcourse
In the peanut gallery you’ll put all our thoughts
Donning Louie Vuitton a booshie faux pas
Bring a smooth response
A cooler balm
Renewed mandala
Frabjous flotilla
Axion exister
Relax my sister
A grandiose sapient... [say he ain’t homo sapien]
Slake your hatred in a video game
Sainton say he on the way
Heading with provisions
Protecting equilibrium
Inspect the vermillion vision, if it isn’t a quintillion invaluable lessons then what is it?
Vociferous incision like infibulation
Limerence unrequited is love mistaken
Real as econometrics is what you’re saying
Homeostatic status is what I’m staying
Statin these ultimatums thru the strophic layers
Smooth as an assailant while jetin away on a spaceship with the... (cash, gem/Gash Dem) so salient
Shit I ain't playin[Sample from "Trespass"]
"You don't know nothing do you?
That's the beauty of gold
It never tarnishes
Lasts forever, too
You can melt it down, pound it, twist it, piss on it
But it's always the same gold
It was here long before we were and it'll be here a long time after we're gone
I bet you a lot of men have died for the gold that's just in this one piece"

[Verse 1]
If you cry under fire then you wasn't built for war
If a pimp take you girl then your girl was never yours
Mental kickboxer, still test jaws
I'm Grandmaster, Grimm Reaper
Feds snooping at door like Mr. Roper
Monitored cause talented like Mr. Ripley
State frustrated, hated, can't get me
The Gingerbread Man but for short call me Gingy
Suicidal, jump right in a glass of milk
I'm made of dough so watch a nigga swell
I could never fall apart cause mad is the flow
You could never ever take my crown, I'll kill you at a show
Hit stars with guns, make 'em see stars
Hit cops with dum-dums, trying to be smart
Gotta lay him down, didn't know he was a narc
Gingerbread man but I have a stone heart
Payback extortion from fraternal order
Informant sent letter to D.A. with tracing paper
With invisible ink, trapped in magic library
I wanna scream but it's a secret indictment
Judge whistle Dixie from excitement
The law is a lefty, so where the rights went?
Pain on display for world like David Blaine
True crime stories but they think I entertain

A man with a dream with plans to make cream, cream, cream
I want the money fuck the fame
A man with a dream with plans to make cream, cream, cream
I want the money fuck the fame
A man with a dream with plans to make cream, cream, cream
I want the money fuck the fame
A man with a dream with plans to make cream, cream, cream
I want the money, I want the money, I want the money

[Verse 2]
Are you down with so and so?
What's your gimmick?
Nothing, my life is lyrics so I spit it
When murder is something that you become accustomed to
Taking a life just don't fuck with you
House niggas faceless, buried in field of potters
Field niggas found shelter, now squatters
If eyes are the window to soul, then why am I squinting?
My face is on the money that I'm printing, strike a pose
Wanna take life, strike my foes
I rolled through Hell and it froze
My halo got burnt but it still glows
I'm not on my feet but I stay on my toes
If we ain't cool then that's the way it goes
Forget all the kid shit fucking with a grown man
Niggas running around fantasizing like they're Peter Pan
Your life's a scam and I'mma fuck it up like Neverland

A man with a dream with plans to make cream, cream, cream
I want the money fuck the fame
A man with a dream with plans to make cream, cream, cream
I want the money fuck the fame
A man with a dream with plans to make cream, cream, cream
I want the money fuck the fame
A man with a dream with plans to make cream, cream, cream
I want the money, I want the money, I want the money

All that other shit is overrated
I want the money
Cash

[Sample from "Trespass"]
"I don't know what this stuff is anymore
God's gold, our gold, fool's gold
What we can do is take as many of them as we can and hope for the best"
"What about trading the gold to 'em for our safety?"
"They'd kill us anyway
I would if I was them
Truth is Vince I don't see any way we're gonna get out of here quiet"

A man with a dream with plans to make cream, cream, cream, cream cream[Sample from "O Brother, Where Art Thou?"]
I'm not hear to make a record, you dumb cracker
They broadcast me out on the radio

[MF Grimm]
Off guard, sleeping hard, like it couldn't happen
Tore me up, riddled up, bullets yeah they hoppin'
Like bunny rabbits, to the creator I'm sent back
Let me live twice, he said "nah, it's a wrap"
Lives are taken when it's about the paper
Some are starving and hungry for the power
Others are thirsty for the blood and love the pleasure
Don't want to go so I summon the devil
I said

Lucifer Morningstar
(If you give me one more chance)
I'll make the best of it
Lucifer Morningstar
(If you give me one more chance)
Then my soul you'll get
Cause I can't handle it
Revenge I need the shit
I wanna live on like I'm Spawn, raisin' hell and fits
Grant me what I need
Brought back and make 'em bleed
I want 'em all gone cause I'm gone and God won't let me leave
So listen up, I'm asking you to give me
One more chance like them girls be begging Biggie
Cause I got to dance with these niggas who tried to kill me
If God don't feel me, then Satan I know you hear me
The fact I summoned you, some will find silly
But they never been dead, so why the fuck really
Would I stop to be undead or fed until they under
And undercovers can't stop me nor the feds
Bowling for dollars, knock 'em down for the bread
Kingpin is the charge cause large is bloodshed
The seventh circle, the square I'll rest my head
Cause they step to my b.i. this is what I said
I said

Lucifer Morningstar
(If you give me one more chance)
I'll make the best of it
Lucifer Morningstar
(If you give me one more chance)
Then my soul you'll get
Cause I can't handle it
Revenge I need the shit
I wanna live on like I'm Spawn, raisin' hell and fits
Grant me what I need
Brought back to make them bleed
I want them all gone but I'm gone and God won't let me leave
So listen up, I'm asking you to give me
One more chance like them girls be begging Biggie
Cause I got to dance with these niggas who tried to kill me
If God don't feel me, then Satan I know you hear me

Revenge (get it, get it)
Revenge (get it, get it)
Revenge (get it, get it)
Revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge (get it, get it)
Revenge (get it, get it)
Revenge (get it, get it)
Revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge (get it, get it)
Revenge (get it, get it)
Revenge (get it, get it)

[Sample from "O Brother, Where Art Thou?"]
I have it from the highest authority
That that Negro sold his soul to the devil!

Oh!

W-W-Wait a minute now folks, it's true!
It's true!
Wait a minute folks no
Is you is or is you ain't my constituency?[Verse 1: Sam Mickens]
When I came back
I brought something back with me
Or was it left behind
What lives in my mind?
What lives in my body?
Tail-spun and saliva-covered
Marooned in the bottle city

[Hook]
Grisly ghouls, from every tomb
Some are unmarked, some "loving groom"
Hunger dogs and hungry moon
Grisly ghouls, from every tomb

[Verse 2: MF Grimm]
Back from beyond
Some understand
That there's forces way beyond man
Trapped in realm
Matter doesn't matter
Female singing "undead"
I can't see her
Hypnotize my voice
I want to meet her
Give in to my sins
So I could greet her
Devil steals soul
Can't function
She was just an introduction
Evil entities working in conjunction
Whispering Gemini instructions
Castor and Pollux twin energies
Causing murder and destruction
Grisly ghouls
Escaped from the tombs
Cursed like a werewolf
Trapped on the moon
Something from the other side making me pay
So I take life day by day
That's the way

Undead, undead, undead[Verse 1]
The drama started up in Heaven, chilling when the phone rang
It was Saint Peter, he said get the heater
We have new angels, in their eyes I saw sin
They came to the gates and I wouldn't let 'em in
Homeland security's tighter up in Heaven
Ever since 9/11
Anyway, back to the phone call Saint Peter said
Motherfuckers bum rushed me, punched me in the head
Threw up gang signs, couldn't hear what was said
Took the keys, shot me, left me there for dead
Still breathing but bleeding, bullets start to sting
Couldn't fly so I called the hospital of kings
Choir wanna solo, I will never sing
They tried to say the doctors had to amputate my wing
Took a spot, set up shop, selling dust to angels
We work hard for that, get the guns, it's time to tango

[Hook]
Hey you get off my cloud
You don't know me and you don't know my style
Hey you get off my cloud
Try to take Heaven but I gotta give you hell
Hey you get off my cloud
You don't know me and you don't know my style
Hey you get off my cloud
Try to take Heaven but I gotta give you hell

[Verse 2]
Motherfuckers got me filled with anger
Clouds in Heaven being run by some strangers
Angels wasn't normal, naughty little devils
They said fuck everybody, independent rebels
To prove a point they executed Michael
In broad daylight, then repeated cycle
Murdered Gabriel then said the cloud is ours
You bitches up here, you don't want no war
That's what one said, he had a wife, he beat her
It was clear to me that he was the leader
Rocked a platinum halo with diamonds on it
Pumping a cd, he was rhyming on it
The beats was hot, could've had better timing on it
Anyway, I said that to say this
Selling all that angel dust in Heaven made 'em rich
High rollers, they heated up and got colder
Now selling dope, they got it on smash
Other angels can't cope and they wanna kill they ass
The higher-ups know they making cash, they on the take
Gotta grease they palms, Heaven is political
Movement take muscle when getting physical
Mind over matter on the cloud is getting critical
(Critical) What we gonna do?
What we gonna do?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
The leader was arrogant, walked with a swagger
Even when he flew, he did that snotty too
Couldn't take no more, flap wings, got the pistol
Demons think we sloppy, break 'em off proper
Didn't have a vest, too vain, he didn't need that
Shot him in his chest, blew the feathers off his back
That set it off, the war was on
Thought he was a king but he was only a pawn
Crew turned to cowards once their leader was gone
Bullets start to shower, angels start to shiver
Blood start to drip until it made a river
No angel police, this was settled on the streets
Looked the other way, a word they didn't say
Cause they all knew someone's gonna pay
Chase the demons outta here, got back our flow
Keep it moving niggas, we had to let them know

[Hook]

(Word up)
The bottom line is we got it back
Back in business
Something goes down, if a bag is sold I want our cut
I want a cut
I want in on everything
