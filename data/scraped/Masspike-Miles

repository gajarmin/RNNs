[Intro: Rick Ross]
Uhh, uhh
I'm so compassionate with my compositions
Check it

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Fascinated with foreign felines since I was knee high
This cigar got me buzzin like a beehive
Fuck my old chick I'm ridin with my new thing
In her blue jeans, panties like shoestrings
Most wanted, I'm Bin Laden on a beat nigga
Rubberband jeans saggin on my feet nigga
100 grand for the wagon and her feet nigga
Black flaggin just braggin I'm a street nigga
On the grind little rappers wanna eat with us
Tryin to shine like birdman man teeth glitters
VMA find time just to creep wit her
So coincidental walkin down the street wit her
My loose cheese scooped up the Gucci
In 2 weeks I flew thru the boutiques
She get her time limit when I let her go and shop
Cruisin in the car clip the cuban at the top
Niggas know that my techs explode
Down to go toe to toe before Tecmo Bowl
Biggest boss in the game, chatter I never mind that
Cuz if it mattered C-Murder would go diamond
I reflect as I'm ridin in a Rolls Royce
Get respect because I give these hoes no choice

[Hook: Masspike Miles]
Because I-I-I-I-I
Because I do it
So if you never seen a boss nigga
Then look at me
Because I do it
And they never seen a boss nigga
But now they see
Because I do it
And I do it
I-I-I-I-I
And I do it
Yeah so now you see what it means
To be a boss cuz I do it

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I'm the down-south Nas
Click so firm
Ridin with a fox as the cigar burn
Niggas sell weed, niggas sell coke
If I was sellin dope baby I'd be sellin both
But I'm sellin records everything I touch gold
Better yet check the record 3 million sold
2 hand guns on the riders for the show
On the road to the riches when I'm ridin on vogues
I elaborate on things I only been bout
Besides, we decides who's the in crowd
If its Ne-Yo and niggas who speakin Creole
What I got the prove we just keep movin kilos
See the Audemar its call it Terminator
The exact watch only Arnold wore in Terminator
I let her ride me like a elevator
Clip another cuban as I wait to celebrate her

[Hook: Masspike Miles]

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Fascinated with foreign felines, that's my design
As I recline cut em like key lime
We both came now its right back to the tea time
I wanna soda with no vulgar or no cheap wine
She told me that her other man man broke
Walkin on the clouds in my second hand smoke
I touched her with the seconds hand stroke
Got her mind racin quicker than a Lambo
2 seater it couldn't fit Toccara
But I promise baby ill be back tomorrow
In a big beamer bumpin Bob Marley
Listen closely and hit a woman softly

[Hook: Masspike Miles][Hook: Masspike Miles]
I put the "b" in "banger"
Used to getting money
Now you know I'm no stranger to the hustle
I'm strapped up like a raider from the tomb
Force with my platoon
I do shit you boys don't do
I'm known in the streets as a nigga that done did it
Put infrared beams on your fitted
Trust me, you can get it
Nigga, you can get it
Throw the handle back and watch the motherfucker bang, bang, bang

[Verse 1: Cassidy]
Yes
If I'm not the best, nigga, then I got next
Cause I talk that shit like a nigga with hot breath
You niggas not threats, them things'll bang in
Things could change if you never got shot yet
I'm quick to bust, like a man that never got sex
But you don't get the message, like a blind man that got text
I used to love to box, until I shot Tecs
Now I never brawl, like a broad that ain't got breasts
I'm not press, I don't wanna talk
Man, my motherfucking gun'll spark and make a nigga somersault
I'll shoot the damn thing and make a nigga handspring
Or I'll spark steel and make a nigga cartwheel
Matter of fact, clap the gat, turn him to an acrobat
Have the cat flip around before I put the pistol down
Your lame mouth which you better keep my name out
I ain't in a gang, I don't bang, I just banged out

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Styles P]
I'm back out riding
Gun at your head, bullet the center like Bonham
Shotgun with the shotgun seat reclining
I pop up on niggas
Let it off, close shop up on niggas
Infection, stay in the cut on niggas
I'm in a whole nother section
I could look in the mirror, my reflection
Moves like Inception
Extraordinary gentleman, what more could I say?
Got the picture in the cut, like Dorian Gray
I'm a shooter like Allan Quartermain, I give you more than pain
First page in the hard nigga Hall of Fame
Duane Darock on the beat
SP the Ghost, I make it pop on the streets
Probably in the spot for a week
One eye open, with the Glock on a sleeve

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chubby Jag]
I let the thing blam, they call me the Rain Man
I'm out of bullets, get 'em hung, nigga, Hang Man
You get me, hang it up; there's problems, I flame it up
Bang it up, snap back, long t, banger tucked
Yup, my block pitching, yeah I got pigeons
I'm into cooking, I fuck with bitches that got kitchens
If I can't find Jordan, then I'll rob Pippen
I leave 'em bloody and skin red, like Rob Griffin
Home real spit, the shotty blast, you gon' see the body bags
Men in black, no Will Smith
Real shit, used to grind and we still grind
Beefing with the grill time, full metal, steel time
Niggas getting stole on trying to steal mine
Cock pack, peel mine
Tape 'em up, real time
Jump you, the mask on and Berettas bang
Sound clear, holmes? Out here, we gonna let it bang

[Hook][Intro]

Wanna hate just cause I’m the man, call me "mister got it all"
Drop stacks on the bar just cause I can
I’ll teach you how to ball
Better do your lay ups, better get your weight up
Your swag's a made-up
Your girl should take her
You ball 'n fall, not me at all
I’m on my job, I got it all

[Hook]
I came straight up from the bottom
And now it’s my time to shine
I do this cause it’s my ambition
If I want it, then I’m gonna get mine
I came too far to turn around, oho
I came too far to give up now

[Hook]
Yeah, yeah, I got it, yeah, yeah I got it
Yeah, yeah, I got it
Cause I’m a boss
Yeah, yeah, I got it, yeah, yeah I got it
Yeah, yeah, I got it

[Verse]
Hold up, wait a minute, let me put my swag up in it
That boy ain’t workin', your girl stay flirtin'
And that’s for certain, I’m so deserted
Your voice's distortion, while your pockets hurting
Better do your lay ups, better get your weight up
Your swag's a made-up
Your girl should take her
You ball 'n fall, not me at all
I’m on my job, yeah I got it all (yeah)

[Hook]
I came straight up from the bottom
And now it’s my time to shine
I do this cause it’s my ambition

Wanna talk to the ladies for a second

Round of applause for the sexy miss
Body to pop 'em and you get it Tess
Subtract the clothes, add in miss the sex
Multiplying to fight it girl

When it came to women told myself I'll never cough
'Til I met you it was like I won a millions bucks
Keep it thriller you the realest bitch I ever touched
Counting paper on the jet we only doin' lunch
This bow shit with a bad bitch
That's staking off for the main dish
She holding on to this sea shit
And dick it out for that tweak fix
I'm taking off, she goin' down
Deep in , she moanin' now
Destination no hesitation
It's my pussy no reservation
Say hell yeah , I meant that
Handbag costs 2 stacks
Damn right, my bitch bad
And that ass on her just so fat
Penthouse on floor 8,wait wait I must say
Know your body been feeding for you like
That shit home,baby

Motherfuckers talkin' bout climate change
How it’s getting high
It’s cold out this motherfucker
Real cold, it’s a real cold world right now
You know what I’m sayin?
You just better keep that heat on 'em
It’s real

[Verse 1: Havoc]
I’m tryin' to fight these demons off
Not guilty – how a nigga gotta plead in court
Eyes red, they be wonderin' what weed I'm on
God got a lightning rod, respect it when you see a boss
And I be doing this for how long?
Knock it out the park when niggas push the real boss
No money down, everything is all paid for
Niggas comin' after mine, you know we got stay before us
Clap clap and I ain’t talkin' bout a stripper’s ass
Bangin' out, whippin' like took all these cameras flash
You fuckin' with a titan, you don’t wanna catch me
Oh you’re comfortable everywhere, got that home advantage
I have your soul leavin' the fuckin' planet
And I ain’t tryna put you out there I'm just being candent
You just a flavor of the month, career gon' need a bandage
When I’m finished with the motherfucker, toe tag 'em

[Hook]
These colder days, everything below zero
Fuck being loved, it’s better when these cowards fear you
Never isolate and keep your enemies near you
‘Cause any chance they get, these motherfuckers try to hear you
Speakin' from the point of weakness, nigga not tryna hear you
Fuck a ho, I'm tryna to save ya, look what happened to heroes
Niggas get they shit rocked
You all blind, left for dead you outta here in no time

[Verse 2: Havoc]
No time, life is all about choices
Consensus telling me to get it, yeah I'm hearing voices
Pictured myself up in them Rolls Royces
So anything less to me was very pointless
I’m ridin' up the block with the top off
Choppas on deck, case blocked off
Growing up in the hood, have me paranoid
Life in the line of fire, cover the blazing at my voice
No fun when the party ain’t a party to you
Gotta to phase away and now the police stick the body to you
First 48 gotta keep your lips sealed
Next 48 part of the news real
My goons on patrol tryna figure who squealed
Right before you feed the baby, niggas get they food pealed
Niggas talk about who's hood colder
Mine is, try to play the bridge over and you’re dead

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Havoc]
I’m strolling in my long shearling, shotty underneath
Disappearing like my name is Merlin
The magician, have you leakin' that nutrition
Speak go to cuff, track him down like I'm ad-libin'
Man listen, these cowards actin like women
Super bitchy, when he’s on his ass dippin'
Out the back door, runnin' when they mouth off
Til I deck em in they tracks, makin' house calls

[Hook]

[Outro: Masspike Miles]
The streets is cold as ice
Move with precision, boy don’t slip up
Watch out for them lights
Black hoodie season, nigga give it up
My momma would cry cuz it hurts
Because in life that’s just worked
This time I’ve grown just as cold
It’s nothing but colder days
It’s nothing but colder days
So cold ouchea
It’s nothing but colder days
Days, days
It’s nothing but colder days1[Hook: Masspike Miles]
I put the "b" in "banger"

It's gon' stay dark, til a nigga lose, and the sun won't shine
I done seen niggas lose they life out here, how I'm livin' mine
This feelin', you couldn't know, places I've been, you wouldn't go
Goin' through the world, tired enough to keep me out
Only made a nigga harder, who can stop me now?

[Pre-Hook: Masspike Miles]
So whatcha gonna do to me? This ain't nuttin' new to me
There's no nigga more solid, ain't nuttin' more than me

[Hook: Masspike Miles]
In love with this feelin' that's bigger than life
You can do nuttin' to hurt me, they tried
I will conquer all
I will conquer all

[Verse 2: Masspike Miles]
Made a nigga off terrain, watch the weather change in a minute
I could read a nigga brain, niggas playin' games, I ain't wit it
Look in my eyes, what do you see? Pain in my soul, the heart of a G
If it's on me, I'mma keep it G, I don't really know no limit
Been around the world, to another world, only God is my witness

[Pre-Hook + Hook]

[Verse 3: Gunplay]
Take a look at me, take a look at she
Took it to the top, took you from the street
Never had a dime, only had a dream
Only had a name
Niggas call they folks, try to send me up the road
Now I'm on the run
Me and my bitch deal, swisha, bind, money and a gun
Made thru the fire, made it thru the trial, made it thru the dark
Made it to the light, niggas never been thru pain
Painful is mine
Rat niggas on this beach, all I hear is phoney on it
Youz a pussy nigga, I can tell, I can bet my Rollie on it

Before they mess up my speech I tell her swiftly
400 on a bucket, this is your destiny, don't leave until you're lucky
Cough it, I will, let's discuss it, I feel
Like them other dudes made you disgusted, but still
They ain't Waterbed Fred
And all them birds just here for the bread

Round of applause for the sexy miss
Body to pop 'em and you get it Tess

When it came to women told myself I'll never cough
'Til I met you it was like I won a millions bucks
Keep it thriller you the realest bitch I ever touched
Counting paper on the jet we only doin' lunch
This bow shit with a bad bitch
That's staking off for the main dish
She holding on to this sea shit
And dick it out for that tweak fix
I'm taking off, she goin' down
Deep in , she moanin' now
Destination no hesitation
It's my pussy no reservation
Say hell yeah , I meant that
Handbag costs 2 stacks
Damn right, my bitch bad
And that ass on her just so fat
Penthouse on floor 8,wait wait I must say
Know your body been feeding for you like

Hey yo Diddy, it's Ross
I'm still at the Fontainebleau my nigga
I overslept, called downstairs, they said you extended this shit
Spanish bitches still here
Send some more Ciroc over my nigga
I need some trees too
Bugatti Boyz (uh)

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
The view in this motherfucka is amazing
The one I flew in, this motherfucka's an Asian
Got a few more just being patient
Puff double up we Cam'ron and Mase'em
We used to be ashy on porches
Now we lease Aston's and on Porsches
Italian glass the whole fortress
Cracks in the marble, slabs that we cop shit
My marijuana accounts your whole mortgage
My watch, your house, ice flawless
BVS look pink when I light head with the right bitch, white mink be the icy
Louis Vuitton button up my companion
An LG show the bag for the cannon (come on)
22-32 or straight 8
Fuck her real hard just for the strange face

[Hook: Masspike Miles]
Live the good life
This is what it looks like (living crazy)
I tell em' fuck you baby (yeah)
The big boys do it like this
This is money so we gotta get paid
Baby do it your way I get it my way
But the difference is I make it look easy

[Interlude: Diddy]
Take your time with it
Turn up your motherfuckin radio
And hear what we hear
See what we see (Bugatti Boys!)
Feel what we feel
Hey yo turn me up
I speak softly when I talk to these hoes
Check it out...

[Verse 2: Diddy]
I'm interested in women that's independent
But the shoppin sprees can be extended
New Benz's, your license is suspended
Your man pretending my bank account tremendous
We going places no other niggas ever though about
Bora Bora, I'll show you what the yacht about
It's simple math, all I wanna do is spoil her
Look at her hand, the great rock of Gibraltar
Buyin land the half a size of Florida
Baby I'm a baller, New York's my ball court
Straight out of Harlem, home of the cut steez
Women lust me, 100 G's for the cufflinks
A queen is always a man's best accessory (that's right)
Look at mine, she half black and Cherokee
I hit the lotto with all my mulattos
You recognize the model with the top off the Gelato
(Yeah, come on)

[Outro: Diddy]
You see, a lot of niggas be talkin that shit
But they don't be talkin that fly shit
Cuz they never experienced that fly shit
You see, we the Bugatti Boyz baby, we talk because we live it
Take a deep breathe and smell that effervescence
Yeah that's real motherfuckin pimpin
Yeah, if I said it, I did it
You know my name bitch, and if you forget, I'm Puff Daddy
And that's my nigga Rozay
As you close your eyes you can fly
You can see the visions that I see from the view up high
I've been here before you
Imma be here after you
And imma be here when you decide to come back mothafucka
But bring your bitch with you, come on
Damn!
Damn, feels so good
Niggas dont even make music like this no more
You feel me Rosé?
It's the Bugatti Boyz!
That soul music!
That fried chicken and champagne, with some diamonds
Yeah, five million in cash on the bed for no reason
(Phone rings)
With three mothafuckin bitches just money wrestling and shit
Not mud wrestling, money wrestling
You see, this is the way life is for some niggas
They the chosen ones
Hate is for suckas nigga, get some love in your life, you'll be blessed for it (Come on)[Hook: Gunplay and Masspike Miles]
Got my hate up with my weight, cause niggas gon' test ya
And these bitches only with you for the fame
I'm just tryna to live ten toes on the grit
But I became a house hold name (Now I'm a house hold name)
Wanna be a rapper but they just won’t let it happen
Nigga tryna trade the cage for the stage
They paid on our demises try to stop us rising
But in the process we became a house hold name
(Now I'm a house hold name)

[Verse 1: Gunplay]
Tell me why you niggas want to see me broke and dead
Don't wanna see me eating, wanna see me choke instead
And that’s why my chopper be my only co-conspirator
Cocaine, coke, and Smirnoff this ain't no Smoke and Mirrors
Drunk on the road to riches in the V I'm veering off
Sleeping on the steering wheel ended up back in Miramar
I'm looking for my gift already cursed with all this curses
And with these verses I surf the Earth's surface

[Hook: Gunplay and Masspike Miles]
Got my hate up with my weight, cause niggas gon' test ya
And these bitches only with you for the fame
I'm just tryna to live ten toes on the grit
But I became a house hold name (Now I'm a house hold name)
Wanna be a rapper but they just won’t let it happen
Nigga tryna trade the cage for the stage
They paid on our demises try to stop us rising
But in the process we became a house hold name
(Now I'm a house hold name)

[Verse 2: Gunplay]
I just wanna write rap songs, rock black stones
Watch craps roll, and stay off of tapped phones
I just want a clean bitch in a black thong
And just one slida rida I can bank on
I’m a legend living still ain't begged forgiveness
As I chug another Guinness, choppin' work up with the winners and the trap hoes
They try to end me from the start
Looking up to God, as I embark upon a higher plateau

[Hook: Gunplay and Masspike Miles]
Got my hate up with my weight, cause niggas gon' test ya
And these bitches only with you for the fame
I'm just tryna to live ten toes on the grit
But I became a house hold name (Now I'm a house hold name)
Wanna be a rapper but they just won’t let it happen
Nigga tryna trade the cage for the stage
They paid on our demises try to stop us rising
But in the process we became a house hold name
(Now I'm a house hold name)

[Verse 3: Masspike Miles]
They try hold me back yeah they wanna see a real nigga fall
They told me life is the price and my loved ones tears was the cause
Yeah, all my real niggas feel me
Try to judge but there's nothing that defeats me
For the love of the fame
They sacrifice for a name
Cause that's the rule of the game

[Hook: Gunplay and Masspike Miles]
Got my hate up with my weight, cause niggas gon' test ya
And these bitches only with you for the fame
I'm just tryna to live ten toes on the grit
But I became a house hold name (Now I'm a house hold name)
Wanna be a rapper but they just won’t let it happen
Nigga tryna trade the cage for the stage
They paid on our demises try to stop us rising
But in the process we became a house hold name
(Now I'm a house hold name)[Verse]
Wanna hate just cause I’m the man, call me "mister got it all"
Drop stacks on the bar just cause I can
I’ll teach you how to ball
Better do your lay ups, better get your weight up
Your swag's a made-up
Your girl should take her
You ball 'n fall, not me at all
I’m on my job, I got it all

[Hook]
I came straight up from the bottom
And now it’s my time to shine
I do this cause it’s my ambition
If I want it, then I’m gonna get mine
I came too far to turn around, oho
I came too far to give up now

[Hook]
Yeah, yeah, I got it, yeah, yeah I got it
Yeah, yeah, I got it
Cause I’m a boss
Yeah, yeah, I got it, yeah, yeah I got it
Yeah, yeah, I got it
Cause I’m a boss

[Verse]
Hold up, wait a minute, let me put my swag up in it
That boy ain’t workin', your girl stay flirtin'
And that’s for certain, I’m so deserted
Your voice's distortion, while your pockets hurting
Better do your lay ups, better get your weight up
Your swag's a made-up
Your girl should take her
You ball 'n fall, not me at all
I’m on my job, yeah I got it all (yeah)

[Hook]

Rick Ross: Im not lying no more baby, Im through lying..
Girl: You promise?
Rick Ross: I swear, I swear. Baby no more lies, I solemnly swear, for real...
Girl: You said that last time!

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
They say I look nice in the mag
Plus the best on the cover(undercover)
Why it take a dopeboy to invest in a brother
It's time to wipe the tears of the face of our mothers
Sell a little base, appeal the case for my brothers
Fuck my problems for a second
Can I let my ace bubble?
She pressin in the club, in the presence of a thug
In need of satisfaction baby? I can be your plug
The boss talk slang, but I love to french kiss
Pour the money in the tub, so she call me filthy rich
Gotta send her shopping with at least a fifty clip
I'm way better than her last
Boy was a fan
Even had her blowing grass
Tell your friends you had a blast
Speedin' in the Spyker, she keep calling it a Jaq
I'm a superman, she call me I'll be there in a flash
I solemnly swear
With my hand on the bible
Big things, 10 million upon arrival

[Hook: Masspike Miles]
I said baby I got you
I solemnly swear I love you

I swear that love for you

I said no one else matters
I swear shit can only get better

I swear baby I got you

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Aromatherapy merry, she wanna marry me
I'm burning salary till the day they ready to burry me
7 feet
But I'm still in the paint
Like a nigga 7 feet
I'm Shaquille in the bank
I'm Jordan of the whips
Pippin of the pimpin
You're John Amaechi nigga, you a bitch among the bitches
Rollin' 50 deep, so now we clear and out the bleachers
Ron Artest, yes it's 50 for the features
Comma's like ??Adonis???..
Endorsing them Gucci sneakers
Pull up in the Porsche, off course I'm feelin' the speakers
Feelin like chillin', I'm billin', blowin' that reaver
Ho's feelin me, while ho's should fill in my visa
Call me Master P
Cuz it ain't no limit
I'm jumping like Spud Webb
Coach I gotta go get it
Trapping like running sprints
Catch your breath, count your chips
My lawyer Pat Riley
I needed a great defense!
I solemnly swear
Hand on the bible
NBA money, bonus upon arrival

[Hook: Masspike Miles]
I said baby I got you
I solemnly swear I love you

I swear that love for you

I said no one else matters
I swear shit can only get better

I swear baby I got you[Verse 1:]
I put my money in the freezer, I call it cold cash
My coat stash is bigger than Coca-Cola's ass
It's dimes in my pocket, dimes in my bed
Serve a quarter chicken, make sure you fed
The trap love me, cousin I rap lovely
Been killing 'em from the jump, crack bungee
I'm Chris Humphries, cheating on the baddest bitch
40 round clip, I call it the magic stick
It makes rappers disappear, whisper in yo ear
Crystal clear, come here, let me kiss yo tears
Put the lotion in the basket bitch before you catch it
Tie you to a mattress, turn it into yo casket
I get respect on the same blocks who hustle on
So is it's all I'm The West, fuck yo mom!
Fore the came up we, I keep the cutties calm
These serial killers will eat you for your lucky charm

[Hook:]
This one for the dollar, gotta get it
That's all that I do
Can never be scared cause we with it
Gotta do what I do yea
It's all for the love of money
Cash, clothes, the cars and the honeys
Yea money makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round ah yea

[Verse 2:]
I wanna make love to an angel
My pocket is handcuffed to a halo
I stand up in the ghetto, babe bro, this ain't full
Button ups and cangos, my pockets lumpy
Like I stuff potatoes under mangos
Big guns stuffed with egg rolls
Who wanna tango? This is wrong
I'm re-tweeting, why the dope problem?
So DM it baby if you got a coke problem
I gotta see er cope, got er nose diving
Without yo favorite rapper co-signing
I got a gorgeous day but you got this note that I got it all
That as soon as it got important
Like a model from a 3rd world country that I
Nutted in before she got deported
And I signed a deal for the part, no before it got recorded
This is business, for that money I blow
Leave yo aye, yo sunny side up, rude boy

[Hook:]
This one for the dollar, gotta get it
That's all that I do
Can never be scared cause we with it
Gotta do what I do yea

[Verse 3:]
Listen, we tryna make digits, gotta get me a few bucks
You tryna play with it, that gets you a few buck buck
Sun is dead a real, we move weight
Homie you on a treadmill tryna remove weight
Lots of haters, they are mad
They pissed off cause cash I pilot like the operator aircraft
Cocked and spray up their ass
I hit you with the impact of a truck
But I will not inflate a airbag
Gotta get this cheddar for...
My first and second born
If this epilogue never score big I ain't never raw but I swear
If ain't got some chips
Cock the 5th, turn yo Range to a pasta dish nigga
Gotta watch the million frames, they go over a million frames
Long as you can game ends
But see when no money remains then they'll be gone
Put that in the cane end
Money to the eyes wide, like they on a kingpin, excuse me

[Hook:]
This one for the dollar, gotta get it
That's all that I do
Can never be scared cause we with it
Gotta do what I do yea
It's all for the love of money
Cash, clothes, the cars and the honeys
Yea money makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round ah yea1[Verse 1: Gunplay]
She know what a felon is
I fell in love with her vanilla-ness
And the way she keep me on my toes
Up for days together, heaven knows
Nothing came between the bond
She had flaws, I adored every single one
She was heartless, such a cold bitch
A big flirt, flirtin' with a whole clique
She the queen in Miami, where money is a major issue
Her sister was re(?) tell her rest in peace too
Search for the place where I find her embrace
Usually in the trap with my niggas on the chase
I fuck with her, tough, you can see it in my face
See it in my swag you can tell I had a taste
But I love her though
But she don't get along with my mother though

[Hook]
Vanilla texture
Oh you feel so sweet baby girl, vanilla texture
You make me weak to my knees
Baby you’re my, vanilla texture
Close my eyes and begin to enjoy this ride
Baby you’re my next in line, for your vanilla texture

[Verse 2]
Every single minute, it's gettin' sweeter as the day goes by
Wherever everything lace moves, yeah, oh
Body is first class from heaven’s fall all from the sky
So lay back and relax, while I let my hands explore
Oh yeah, you like it like that, baby tell me do you want more?
Ooh, forget the bill girl, let’s pro pone her

Kiss and lick then switch positions

Loosen up and you’ll begin a little stitching

I swear there's nothing better than your, vanilla texture
Oh you feel so sweet baby girl, vanilla texture
You make me weak to my knees
Baby you’re my, vanilla texture
Close my eyes and begin to enjoy this ride
Baby you’re my next in line, for your vanilla texture

[Verse 3]
Ain’t no need for talking, sit back and let my fingers do the walking
Proceed your body with precaution, soft, tender loving giving often
As your tender love begins to soften, oh girl you blow my mind
Vanilla texture girl got me high
Baby that’s no lie
Oh yeah, you like it like that, baby tell me do you want more?
Uh, forget the bill girl, let’s pro pone her

Is ima do me, and you could do you
Enough with the boo hoos
I just wanna cruise, party wit my crew
And beefin' wit you is something i ain't tryna do
I just wanna vibe, chill and take a ride
But you wanna scream, and cry killin' my eye
You should watch your tone, screamin' on the phone
That ain't how you keep a man, that's where you wrong
I be on the plane, every other day
So you gotta feel me when Im around the way
I be tryna lean, prolly with my team
But you want me in the lil pocket in ya jeans
I know I be over seas, and I be in your dreams
So when i'm around baby, all you want is me
Come on mami leave the key in the mailbox
I'll see you when I'm done with the Smirnoff

[Chorus]

[2nd Verse: Bun B]
Man, God damn girl here we go again
You all up in my grill bout the time we don't spend
You always asking where you goin'?, where you been?
When I don't pick up the phone, I must be wit my girlfriend
You need to back up off a little bit and raise up
You tryna shorten my time and slow my days up
Im tryna hang with the homeboys and blaze up
But all you wanna do it start drama, craze nut
That's not the move, you need to take a chill pill
Let me sit you down and tell you whats the real deal
Just cause im settled down don't mean I'm not still trill
I went out before you and after you I still will
Not tryna be rude, just tryna be true
Im from the south, I can't help it, that's how we do
They gave me runners, transparent girls see through
And I ain't got time, so holla I'll see you

[Chorus]

[3rd Verse: Termanology]
You see me talkin' to her, I ain't necessarily getting it on
I could be talkin' to her bout Sierra Leone
Or maybe my cologne , or maybe Al Capone
There's so many directions conversations can go
So why you on patrol, like I'm on parole
You just wanna know in your heart, you in control
I just wanna roll, pockets on swoll
Hit the strip club wit mad money to blow
Yeah I know its cold, but I live a code
Money over Bitches, my squad before a ho
Maybe you should go, cause you ain't comin' home wit me
I'm tryna do my thing, you should just let it be

[Chorus]
