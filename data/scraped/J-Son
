[Verse 1: Flame]
See a song like this is so vintage
So authentic and there’s no gimmick
And by the First Amendment I'm free to speak
About an ancient King from the Middle East
He's the Lion, the Lamb, the "I am" from Zion
They Crucified Him, that's so defiant
And the first of the Ten Commandments been abandoned
Look at man and there is no reliance
There is slow compliance, or no compliance
I know they hate it I get it, I get (I get it, I get it)
But who resurrected? He did it, He did it
He layed His life down and took it up
2000 years plus, now look at us
Christianity spread, gang of bloodshed for us, go and look it up
And I ain't tryna be a tough guy, and I ain't tryna be a martyr either
And I ain't got the "kill me" complex, I just wanna be just like Jesus
When it's my time to go, I wanna die with grace
I wanna die with faith, knowing that I'm bout to see His face
Wanna be filled with the Spirit and no longer fear
I'm living for You Lord as long as I'm here

[Hook: Thi'sl]
You can take my life! (x6)
You can take my (x4)
You can take my life! (6)
You can take my (x4)
You can take my life
[Verse 2: Json]
Said he'll take my life, I said go ahead and take it
Tell me how I'm gon' lose it? Christ already saved it
He said "I'm gon' cock back I'mma let it fly for that bullseye"
I said "Cool, I got clear sight and my lamp's on for that full ride," (that full ride)
So go on and take my life, I'mma lay it down where that ground at
Where that ground at? On that ground flat, same place where that crown at
For every soldier that's chained up, chained up that's been locked down
Church boy, church girl, youth group that's getting mocked now
Christ is still with us, He said He wouldn't leave us
He promised us all (He promised us all)
They'll mock us, they'll shoot us, they'll lock us
I promise they won't stop our souls
Won't stop our souls, death is just sleep for me
We got the victory, cock and reload
Death where yo stinging be? we still believe and the Rock is our fortress
He got us fo’ sho’
We refusing to stand down, ‘cuz faith's why we stand up
If faith's in your heart now, everybody get your hands up
'Cuz He makes my life, He could break my life
He could shake my life, if He want to
He can take my, He can take my life

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Thi'sl]
I had this vision I was locked up in this Middle Eastern prison
Guards all around me, they strapped up like something serious
All the guards, they got guns, look like I'm losin'
They ask me did I love Jesus before they start shooting
Holes all in my body, blood over my body
We all know how this gon' go, I ain't waking up in a Bugatti (in a new Bugatti)
If I make it to that place, Jesus hold me close
Take my fear, Lord fill me with your Holy Ghost
That's for my brotha’s over in the Middle East, that dyin off in them streets
They runnin' up in they house at night putting the heat to 'em while they sleep
And it's all for the Cross, 'cuz they boldly proclaim His name (they proclaim His name)
They ain't scared of the guns, they ain't scared of the jails or the chains
(We ain't scared of the chains)
This for Africa, Syria and Afghanistan
Every soldier that lost they life all the way over to Pakistan
They could close our eyes, but they cannot dim our light
Cuz we signed up to die
You can take my, You can take my life

[Hook][Verse 1]
[Tone Damli]
Every step, that I take, is like miles from where I wanna be
Miles away from you and me, yeah
Here I am, standing hopeless with no plan
Cause I love another man

[Eric Saade]
She doesn't know that I am picturing you
Anyday I walk a hunderd miles in his shoes
No matter how I try, you're still inside my mind
My mind

[Chorus:]
Everytime we're touching , everytime we're kissing
You're the one I imagine, you're the one I imagine
Everytime he holds me, I'd rather be lonely
You're the one I imagine, you're the one I imagine
It should've been us, it could've been you
It will belong, with the perfect view
Everytime we're touching , everytime we're kissing
You're the one I imagine, you're the one I imagine

[Verse 2]
[Tone Damli]
Every breath, that I take, it's like breathing underwater
But easy when I call out your name
Sad to say, he can never take your place
You will never be replaced, no

[Eric Saade]
She doesn't know that I'm still thinking of you
Anyday I'd run a thousand miles in his shoes
No matter how I try, I can't get you out of my mind
My mind

[Chorus]

[Eric Saade & Tone Damli]
It's in every little thing you do
You're running around in my head
And I can't forget about you
I'd rather be lonely instead

[Chorus][Hook: AD3]
Look who I've become
No I'm not who I used to be
That man that you used to see
He's through me I'm not the same one
Flashy cars and jewelry
No longer are they moving me
Can't you see he's making me over
Over(4 times)
He's making me over over
And I'm not who I used to be
Get used to me
He's making me over

[Verse 1: Json]
I'm definitely not who I was but
No I'm not who I will be
But I'm becoming becoming someone who he's making me daily
Just watch and you'll see
Get used to me
Cause the man who you knew ain't no more
And the man who he is will soon be
Newly defined
Renewed in the mind
Attached to the vine as he pull me
Yes! he's making me over
Yes! my old heart man he took that
And I'm so far gone my mind has been blown
So just say that my wig has been pushed back back
I'm not settling back track
I'm not peddling that fact
Of the evident as I'm cracked cracked
Like a skeleton skeleton
Yeah so we're flipping the dime
Switching a pint of blow
Living to shine
Remember them times
But know that's not how I'm defined no more
I'm blind no more
It's time to go
I'm flying fo' sho'
They looking like how
He used to be wild and foul
He made me his child
But wow you just take a look at me now

[Hook: AD3]

[Verse 2: Json]
So let us just say
He is the potter and I am the clay
My heart is not flesh it's mushy wet yes
It's perfect for him to reshape
I'm just pottery
Dirt from the earth, just a vessel
Cursed, deserving the death yo
Was certainly a retch was made to confess
Because I've been purchased and blessed though
Now I'm living to die
They say that I'm dying to live
I'm trying to give him all I'm just part of me you should clearly that I am now his
I am now his you can keep watching me transform
And that's a truth I will stand on
And stand strong
The potter will perfectly mold when he gets his hands on
Get his hands on me
So look at the potter don't look at the pot
Look at the building don't look at the house
Look at the shepherd don't look at the flock
I belong to my God now
And I'm ready to fly now
And they looking like how
I used to be wild and foul he made me his child and wow
You just take a look at me now

[Hook: AD3]

[Verse 3: Tedashii]
My hearts been changed surgency
It's been replaced no surgery
I'm not the same different me ring that alarm emergency
Been a long time coming
But a change done finally came
Ain't that good news Sam cook I trusted in that name
Everyday, same old war
Feel ya pain say no more
The lie disguised alive fo' sho' but today's that day that I say no more
They can keep coming back but destroy me never
Hate all they want only makes me better
Trust in him with all of my givers
I ain't looking back man it's whatever
Fancy chains keep 'em
They leave me locked and beaten
Bruised up
Feeling used up
But I'm fueled up running on the power finding Jesus
And I promise that see who I am now imago dei
If I'm living than I'm living by the words he say
Running for his name till I ain't got nothing left
Sound weird how I live in him call it dub step

[Hook: AD3][Verse 1: J-Son & Mikeschair]
(It's alright)
Walls are closin' in
I know what it's like
To fight when nothing at all in life seems to be going right
The pressures heavy on you
I'm talkin' heavy pressure
You look around and everyone else is doin' better (it's alright)
Often you are, you are runnin' but stumblin'
Dollars you make, they go out as fast as they comin' in
Man, and you're struglin' just to stay afloat
Relating to Peter, it's safer just to stay in the boat (it's alright)
Open the blinds cause I'm just too distracted to see
Making no sense of why this stuff just keeps happenin' to me
The white flags in your hand ready to have it
I pray you hear that still voice inside when you be prayin' sayin'

[Hook: Mikeschair]
Lay it all down at His feet
When it makes no sense
It's okay
It's alright
Cause He sees and knows your needs
It's alright
It's okay
It's alright
So don't stress, go to your knees

[Verse 2: J-Son]
When someone asks for [?]
So how much more would the Father in Heaven show His love
From every [?] and [?]
Things big and small
Every hair on your head
Yea He cares for it all
He sees your needs and knows 'em
From the job that you lose
The car breakin' down
Kids givin' ya' blues
So when the weight that's on ya'
Brings ya' to ya' knees
Trust is where you should be
And [?] on your knees
That's why the veil was cracked
That's why the grace was shown
To give you access, to the King on the throne

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mikeschair]
All your worries couldn't add a single moment to your life
Cause when you worry, you don't trust Him
Turn and run to the light
And don't be anxious
He'll give you peace that transcends all your strife
He's got amazing plans for you so run with all your might

[Outro: Mikeschair]
It's alright
It's okay
It's alright
Cause He sees and knows your needs
It's alright
It's okay
It's alright
So don't stress go to your knees
It's alright (x7)[Verse 1 – Lecrae]
Yeah … walked out of his home, different time zone
Lives in eternity, now he’s living in time zones?
This is mind blowing, God of the universe
Knows every star in the sky to my human hurts
Made the trees, made the breeze
Made the seas, emcees like J and me
But let me tell you what amazes me
How he came as a man who was made to need
Hungered and thirsted
And the very same earth that he cursed, he’s now fully immersed in
Look at his work, he’s God to be exalted
But he came and lived with people falling and faulted
I hope you get it homes
Only a God who’s perfect in love would ever leave his throne for some skin and bones
It’s hard to live just breathing to death
When the same God that made you is breathing your breath

[Hook – Json & Lecrae]
Who is he?
God in the flesh who was tested
Who came manifested, was killed, resurrected
Who are you?
Do you even know who you are?
Created to know the God who created the stars
Who is he?
He was, he is, he will be
Death couldn’t hold him and neither shall death seal me
Who are you?
You’re better off never existing if you don’t trust the God of the Scriptures
You listenin’?

[Verse 2 – Json]
Can you imagine God in the flesh? Invisible seen as visible
Infinite seeming finite, spirit becoming physical
It’s odd man, God man slept and obeyed
The earth’s confines, to breathe the very breath that he made
He would sweat, he would weep, even eat for his hunger
Defeat death within three, so we’d see that he’s stronger
Could give us anything even offer us wealth
That wouldn’t be love if he ain’t offer himself
So he stepped down from his throne and removed his crown
And touched ground, though he knew he would be bruised and bound
He is now and then next and later on
And still is what me and Crae can’t convey in this song
Though our minds can never reason this thang
The question is: do you really see him the same?
And if you see him as sane, as the living God and matchless Christ
How much do these truths impact your life?

[Hook – Json & Lecrae]

[John Piper]
In order for Jesus to suffer and die, he had to plan way ahead of time, because … he couldn’t die. Immortal. He didn’t have any body, yet he wanted to die … for you. So he planned the whole thing by clothing himself with a body so that he could get hungry and get weary and get sore feet. The incarnation is the preparation of nerve endings for the nails – the preparation of a brow for thorns to press through. He needed to have a broad back so that there was a place for the whip. He needed to have feet so that there was a place for spikes. He needed to have a side so that there was a place for the sword to go in. He needed fleshy cheeks so that Judas would have a place to kiss and there would be a place for the spit to run down that the soldiers put on him. He needed a brain and a spinal column with no vinegar and no gall so that the exquisiteness of the pain could be fully felt. I just plead with you – when you’re reading the bible and you read water toy texts like “he loved you” and “gave himself for you,” you wouldn’t go too fast over it. Linger, linger, linger, and plead with him that your eyes would be opened[Hook: S.O. & Json]
I could feel the pressure all the way (All the way I feel it)
The world'll never like us but it's all good (Ohh)
Standing till they put us in the grave (Ah)
(We ain't afraid homie) Get it, get it, got it, good
(Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!)
Get it, get it, got it, good
(Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!)
Get it, get it, got it, good
(Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!)
Get it, get it, got it, good
(Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!)
Get it, get it, got it, good

[Verse 1: S.O.]
Get it, get it, got it
I ain't tryna brag with what's in my wallet
See that lady winking at me
Tell that lady bird I ain't on it
Think what you want my man, you're my team
But you ain't gettin' none of my Bonet
Christ rules everything around me
That crème de la crème is all that I'm wantin'
I'm wantin' my life to be like His
Stand where the righteous picked up the pen and I'm writing
Kicked off the care what appears that I'm here
But appear when I once used the pair but I'm right
Yeah, Yeah, light shine bright
In the night with the right wear
I'm thinkin' hindsight, thinkin' My Dear
I'm duckin' the limelight seein' my fear
I'm busy just setting the scene
They chasin' the lizzy well let 'em be seen
I could feel pressure but I am a messenger
Tryna get people to trust in The King (My God)
The One that they call Yahweh
Stand firm and affirm till they call my name
One thing I have blood bettin' on my days
Unaware of a snake see I'm on that grace
I feel the pressure huh

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Json][Intro: Trip Lee]
Aw man ya'll done messed up and let us in ya hood

[Hook]
We back in ya hood, aw man

[Verse 1: Trip Lee]
These ain't the Boyz in the Hood but these boys in ya hood
Bringing joy to ya hood, making noise in ya hood
Trying to tell the people bout the Lord cause He's good
No guns on the waist, we bring our swords to ya hood
We know we ain't the dudes the radio wanna play
Cause we don't smoke drank or tote a 44 on the waist
They got them youngsters yearning lusting for change
And they determined to get they verses stuck in ya brain
Our main thing is to get the Lord's Word in ya brain
So you can learn of the King turn and worship His name
We deserve worse we came to Earth cursed, enslaved
But this perfect person yearns to purchase us main
And free us, so we ain't gotta flirt with the flames
He offers to clean us, like a shirt with a stain
His name is proclaimed yeah we know that Jesus is better
That's why we tryin to teach 'em and reach 'em with records

[Verse 2: Thi'sl]
You know your boy hood like old school and check cards
We ain't posting trying to trap fam, we rep God
In the worst areas of your city
You know who I'm rolling with, you peep the stitch on my fitty
We preaching Christ in our Dickies no more sex in the city
We ain't chopping out here derrty we ain't popping no fifties
Aw man, they done let your boy jump on this remix
Even in the hood you see me posted with my crucifix
If you see us on the streets you know we preaching the Word
From the middle of the map all the way to the third
You know what the mission is if we posting the curb
The gospel, the only thing that we package and serve
We spit bars praying that the truth will make you switch lanes
Get changed like some money passed in a dice game
This the aim for the whole squad since Christ came (we ain't ashamed)
You know the rest derrty go on and peep game

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Json]
Aw yeah we in ya hood just to rep the Lord
His word'll melt your hard heart like a Nestle bar
Trip-lee said what it do, let me tell you what it is
We wanna lead more slaves out than Harriet Tubman did
Slaves to what? Slaves to sin, you ain't seeing a change
The reason is plain, you ain't bow to Jesus' name
Look we ain't got no time to slack boy, this here is major
That's why we bring the truth in trap form without the paper
So you gon see us posted when you look on the block
I'm a hustler I want your hood hooked on that rock (I got that rock)
Yeah that's right fam I'm rolling with Jesus
Whose body was broken up like B2K group
Come on and shake loose like a Winans track
Cause you're useless without your life and the Vine attached
So get connected with the truth dog and mash with that
Cause without Christ it's hard to breathe like a asthma attack

[Verse 4: Sho Baraka]
What it do, what's the deal, what's good?
We saints, we scholars, we hood
We use Alpine and Fosgate to preach Christ
Bang it in your speakers He fits any stereo type
We stay seeking His face plus our fellowship's deep
I couldn't survive just giving God one day a week
You would think I was from the farm and not the city streets
By the way that boy from Cali just love to feed sheep
They ask me why I do this, I got hits in my head
Nails hitting His wrists, the gospels hitting the dead
But there's too many emcees and not enough preach
But if you wanna do more than rap then call Reach
But if you just wanna rap then call Diddy
You can make his band, catch cheesecake and run the city
We keep it FOTU til the day that He come
Gotta call Christ the Son cause He shine like one

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Lecrae]
We in ya hood and we can't stop running, the clock's on
So get your boots laced and keep your socks on
Cause shorty still off on the ave with the Glocks on
And yeah they still banging them heads like rock songs
Kids getting grown and they doing profane things main
Sinners still sinning, they doing the same thing
It seem kinda hard out here on a main vein
We preach God's truth in order to change things
The world still passing away, we passing the phrase
No, not passing a daze by passing a J
Naw you can find us preaching Jesus passionately
And if you ain't using that microphone then pass it to me
Cause I rap, but some I folks don't do that there
Lot of em behind the scenes like who that there?
They still preach Jesus while they do that hair
Take orders sell shoes yeah they do that there
We ain't supposed to stop running dog we after the prize
That won't bend break or rust or perish with time
We ain't chasing the wind naw we chasing to win
Women and men and tell them Christ erases they sin

[Verse 6: Tedashii]
Aw naw ya'll done messed up and let us in ya hood again
And my hope is to get you back where you shoulda been
Back with the Father the fact is we falling
We don't combat them we used songs to get at them
And despite all their chatter and their whoopty whoop
We want you looking at the stratus like a roofless coupe
Because the Lord's coming back like those zootsy suits
But we caught up in ourselves like a bougie nupe
We fight a toothless brute who would confuse the truth
And keep you going all in circles like a girl's hoola hoop
So we behoove the youth getting all in your area
Accept the Christ because the fall's getting scarier
We bury ya now at 12 years instead of 80
That's 68 so from 6 to 8 before the dash meets the date
We get it in in that 10 trying to get them in
That's why we all up in your hood like some spinning rimsYes, I'm a artist
But I'm not just music
A voice on a record
Homie I'm a human
So let me let you in
Let you see the strain and the hurt
And the pain, yes it comes with the fame
But I am not just a artist

Shout out to all the artists
If there's a truth to us
Hello to all the bloggers
How you doing reviewers?
You should know that we're human
And this voice that you listen
Is a husband and father
A brother, a Christian
The stage I've been given
It ain't gold cause it glitter
Know what it's like when people judge
Like they know you from Twitter
Or even Facebook
"J's a snake and a lie
He's just a fake
I hit him up
He ain't never reply"
I, I've been gone but not on vacation
And I get home, the wife here's got the baby waiting
My son he got a game
I've been booked for a show
This is our bread and butter
That means I gotta go
No, and I ain't asking for sympathy
I'm just asking for grace and prayer
Remember me
I'm some of what you hear
Portions of what you see
I know I'm a artist
But overall I'm me

Yes, I'm a artist
But I'm not just music
A voice on a record
Homie I'm a human
So let me let you in
Let you see the strain and the hurt
And the pain, yes it comes with the fame
But I am not just a artist
No, I'm not just music
A voice on a record
Homie I'm a human
We, we are not just what you don't wanna see deep
I am just me, I'm human

[Lecrae]

You ain't really real no more
You don't be making music people really feel no more
You used to preach a whole sermon in your songs
Now you sounding kinda watered down
Man what's going on?
Homie I done matured
I have so many issues at heart
Thought that screaming it through my art made me better, set me apart
If I never get to make another Rebel, it's cool
That was a season in my life, let it settle
And I'm in a new season
Growing as a man
I done been around the world
And started my own fam
I've see a lot of pain
I done been through it
Learned their characters more than the things you know and what you do
Who you calling Illuminati?
Not me, got me?
Confused with someone who not me
And if my songs don't define me
Interviews are a piece
So you don't really know me when you see me in the streets
I'm just human

Yes, I'm a artist
But I'm not just music
A voice on a record
Homie I'm a human
So let me let you in
Let you see the strain and the hurt
And the pain, yes it comes with the fame
But I am not just a artist
No, I'm not just music
A voice on a record
Homie I'm a human
We, we are not just what you don't wanna see deep
I am just me, I'm human

My ears stay to the streets
I hear and I listen
But it's good
We all entitled to our own opinions (true)
I embrace your critique
And I'm open to challenge
Let there be grace and truth so I can receive it with balance
I ain't angry or mad
Know the purpose for real
Is that you see me as a person
I hurt and I feel
You hit me up
I wish I could chop it and build with ya
If I'm honest with my life
This is not a real picture
So if we come off cocky or arrogant even, forgive us
We're falling people
Still growing in Jesus
The difference is when they like you and think you rhyme tight
When you fall they throw us all in lime light

Yes, I'm a artist
But I'm not just music
A voice on a record
Homie I'm a human
So let me let you in
Let you see the strain and the hurt
And the pain, yes it comes with the fame
But I am not just a artist
No, I'm not just music
A voice on a record
Homie I'm a human
We, we are not just what you don't wanna see deep
I am just me, I'm human[Hook: K-Drama]
Opposition in my face, trying to play defense
I’m bigger than this dude, this don’t make no sense
I Air Jordan on ‘em
I Air Jordan on ‘em
I Air Jordan on ‘em
I Air Jordan on ‘em

[Verse 1: Thi’sl]
They don’t want it Drama, I bang on these clowns
Slam some truth so heavy on ‘em that it crack the ground
Then bring the rim down, we not backin’ down
When the smoke clears, we standin’, they’re still lookin’ ‘round
The coach done put me in the game so I’m about to clown
When my game off, I got a team to hold me down
Throw your boy J’s all black on ‘em
I’m too big to be Michael so I’ll go Shaq on ‘em

[Verse 2: Json]
See I was weak and feeble, the Holy Ghost he gave me the power forward
And hit the block, posted up like I’m a power forward
And I ain’t backin’ down, I’m refusing to budge
The enemy be tempting me, I ain’t moving a nudge
The Risen Savior took my behavior to the grave with him
Yep I had to die, and Air Jordan when I’m raised with him
Heard what I said, fam?
So tell me how it feels, you’ve been listening to a dead man

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Young Josh]
I Air Jordan on ‘em, they may try to block me
But I push that Rock so can’t nobody stop me
With they trash talk, they try to trip me up
Since I been fixed I’ve been rollin’, I fall he’ll pick me up
My whole team gifted, diverse but unified
Triangle offense homie, Truine, my crew is fly
My Coach draws the plays, yo I just follow through
Playin’ my part straight from the heart, opposition ain’t got a clue

[Verse 4: J. Johnson]
Full court press on, good with the rock, CP
Satan got the box on one on, but he can’t hold me
I give him 33, double that, 66
All in the Hall of Fame stuntin’, shinin’, taking flicks
You think it’s 1 on 5, don’t know I ball with God
Swagger is Jordanesque, didn’t know I could fly
I smell victory when defeat is cookin’
Like Spike Lee I flow, a seasoned vet ???

[Hook x2]

[Verse 5: Derek Minor]
So pimpin’ what it is, take a minute and holla at’cha kin
Unashamed to rep Christ, homie 116
So what I look like, worry about ya hater friends
He elevate me over them, Air Jordan
See come and hit ‘em with Divine, I’m with it, I’ma fall but the Lord protect us all
Say whatever you like whether you wrong or right, but I still got love for y’all
So while you talkin’, we workin’, givin’ truth to the Lord
I can’t see you haters at all, my focus on the cross

[Verse 6: K-Drama]
I Air Jordan on ‘em, I can see myself in the air scorin’ on ‘em
I throw a table in the church, chair soarin’ on ‘em
And like Jesus, I bust a Jeff Gordon on ‘em
I gotta zoom on past
I’m never turning back, made to shine in his face
See Coach Christ on the side, gotta tighten up the lace
And check the ring finger, he the champ, never died
I leveled in the air, the cross with living water out they mouthVerse

Braille can’t see it but you can feel it
Vocals paint you the image of what life is for Christian
My growing pains they been evident
I don’t speak from the past they still here in the present tense
So what your life like?
Is it Christ-like then you’ll suffer with me and that’s the right type
Get the message got believers on my mailing list
The same but read different like we Fahrenheit and Celsius
Was blind but now I HD see it that’s a clear view
Learning from my past that’s why I’m staring through my rear view
Dents in my armor dings in my helmet
Scars in my shoes don’t mean I’m a failure
Just means I’m at war though we fall and we fail
We touch and we feel yea welcome to braille
I wanna give His world view through my experience
And pray my words lead you to HIM in the end period
Cross still on my back
I refuse to drop it
I’m carrying this T because the truth is still the topic
Boy his life it was given that’s why I am living
Ain’t tripping I was blind now I got 20/20 vision lets go

Chorus

Can’t see but believe it
Believing got me seeing I’m certain that my faith is true
This music that we making can’t see it but you feel it and thats what its suppose to do x2[Hook: S.O. & Json]
I could feel the pressure all the way (All the way I feel it)
The world'll never like us but it's all good (Ohh)
Standing till they put us in the grave (Ah)
(We ain't afraid homie) Get it, get it, got it, good
(Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!)
Get it, get it, got it, good
(Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!)
Get it, get it, got it, good
(Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!)
Get it, get it, got it, good
(Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!)
Get it, get it, got it, good

[Verse 1: S.O.]
Get it, get it, got it
I ain't tryna brag with what's in my wallet
See that lady winking at me
Tell that lady bird I ain't on it
Think what you want my man, you're my team
But you ain't gettin' none of my Bonet
Christ rules everything around me
That crème de la crème is all that I'm wantin'
I'm wantin' my life to be like His
Stand where the righteous picked up the pen and I'm writing
Kicked off the care what appears that I'm here
But appear when I once used the pair but I'm right
Yeah, Yeah, light shine bright
In the night with the right wear
I'm thinkin' hindsight, thinkin' My Dear
I'm duckin' the limelight seein' my fear
I'm busy just setting the scene
They chasin' the lizzy well let 'em be seen
I could feel pressure but I am a messenger
Tryna get people to trust in The King (My God)
The One that they call Yahweh
Stand firm and affirm till they call my name
One thing I have blood bettin' on my days
Unaware of a snake see I'm on that grace
I feel the pressure huh

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Json][Verse 1]
[Tone Damli]
Every step, that I take, is like miles from where I wanna be
Miles away from you and me, yeah
Here I am, standing hopeless with no plan
Cause I love another man

[Eric Saade]
She doesn't know that I am picturing you
Anyday I walk a hunderd miles in his shoes
No matter how I try, you're still inside my mind
My mind

[Chorus:]
Everytime we're touching , everytime we're kissing
You're the one I imagine, you're the one I imagine
Everytime he holds me, I'd rather be lonely
You're the one I imagine, you're the one I imagine
It should've been us, it could've been you
It will belong, with the perfect view
Everytime we're touching , everytime we're kissing
You're the one I imagine, you're the one I imagine

[Verse 2]
[Tone Damli]
Every breath, that I take, it's like breathing underwater
But easy when I call out your name
Sad to say, he can never take your place
You will never be replaced, no

[Eric Saade]
She doesn't know that I'm still thinking of you
Anyday I'd run a thousand miles in his shoes
No matter how I try, I can't get you out of my mind
My mind

[Chorus]

[Eric Saade & Tone Damli]
It's in every little thing you do
You're running around in my head
And I can't forget about you
I'd rather be lonely instead

[Chorus][Intro: Trip Lee]
Aw man ya'll done messed up and let us in ya hood

[Hook]
We back in ya hood, aw man

[Verse 1: Trip Lee]
These ain't the Boyz in the Hood but these boys in ya hood
Bringing joy to ya hood, making noise in ya hood
Trying to tell the people bout the Lord cause He's good
No guns on the waist, we bring our swords to ya hood
We know we ain't the dudes the radio wanna play
Cause we don't smoke drank or tote a 44 on the waist
They got them youngsters yearning lusting for change
And they determined to get they verses stuck in ya brain
Our main thing is to get the Lord's Word in ya brain
So you can learn of the King turn and worship His name
We deserve worse we came to Earth cursed, enslaved
But this perfect person yearns to purchase us main
And free us, so we ain't gotta flirt with the flames
He offers to clean us, like a shirt with a stain
His name is proclaimed yeah we know that Jesus is better
That's why we tryin to teach 'em and reach 'em with records

[Verse 2: Thi'sl]
You know your boy hood like old school and check cards
We ain't posting trying to trap fam, we rep God
In the worst areas of your city
You know who I'm rolling with, you peep the stitch on my fitty
We preaching Christ in our Dickies no more sex in the city
We ain't chopping out here derrty we ain't popping no fifties
Aw man, they done let your boy jump on this remix
Even in the hood you see me posted with my crucifix
If you see us on the streets you know we preaching the Word
From the middle of the map all the way to the third
You know what the mission is if we posting the curb
The gospel, the only thing that we package and serve
We spit bars praying that the truth will make you switch lanes
Get changed like some money passed in a dice game
This the aim for the whole squad since Christ came (we ain't ashamed)
You know the rest derrty go on and peep game

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Json]
Aw yeah we in ya hood just to rep the Lord
His word'll melt your hard heart like a Nestle bar
Trip-lee said what it do, let me tell you what it is
We wanna lead more slaves out than Harriet Tubman did
Slaves to what? Slaves to sin, you ain't seeing a change
The reason is plain, you ain't bow to Jesus' name
Look we ain't got no time to slack boy, this here is major
That's why we bring the truth in trap form without the paper
So you gon see us posted when you look on the block
I'm a hustler I want your hood hooked on that rock (I got that rock)
Yeah that's right fam I'm rolling with Jesus
Whose body was broken up like B2K group
Come on and shake loose like a Winans track
Cause you're useless without your life and the Vine attached
So get connected with the truth dog and mash with that
Cause without Christ it's hard to breathe like a asthma attack

[Verse 4: Sho Baraka]
What it do, what's the deal, what's good?
We saints, we scholars, we hood
We use Alpine and Fosgate to preach Christ
Bang it in your speakers He fits any stereo type
We stay seeking His face plus our fellowship's deep
I couldn't survive just giving God one day a week
You would think I was from the farm and not the city streets
By the way that boy from Cali just love to feed sheep
They ask me why I do this, I got hits in my head
Nails hitting His wrists, the gospels hitting the dead
But there's too many emcees and not enough preach
But if you wanna do more than rap then call Reach
But if you just wanna rap then call Diddy
You can make his band, catch cheesecake and run the city
We keep it FOTU til the day that He come
Gotta call Christ the Son cause He shine like one

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Lecrae]
We in ya hood and we can't stop running, the clock's on
So get your boots laced and keep your socks on
Cause shorty still off on the ave with the Glocks on
And yeah they still banging them heads like rock songs
Kids getting grown and they doing profane things main
Sinners still sinning, they doing the same thing
It seem kinda hard out here on a main vein
We preach God's truth in order to change things
The world still passing away, we passing the phrase
No, not passing a daze by passing a J
Naw you can find us preaching Jesus passionately
And if you ain't using that microphone then pass it to me
Cause I rap, but some I folks don't do that there
Lot of em behind the scenes like who that there?
They still preach Jesus while they do that hair
Take orders sell shoes yeah they do that there
We ain't supposed to stop running dog we after the prize
That won't bend break or rust or perish with time
We ain't chasing the wind naw we chasing to win
Women and men and tell them Christ erases they sin

[Verse 6: Tedashii]
Aw naw ya'll done messed up and let us in ya hood again
And my hope is to get you back where you shoulda been
Back with the Father the fact is we falling
We don't combat them we used songs to get at them
And despite all their chatter and their whoopty whoop
We want you looking at the stratus like a roofless coupe
Because the Lord's coming back like those zootsy suits
But we caught up in ourselves like a bougie nupe
We fight a toothless brute who would confuse the truth
And keep you going all in circles like a girl's hoola hoop
So we behoove the youth getting all in your area
Accept the Christ because the fall's getting scarier
We bury ya now at 12 years instead of 80
That's 68 so from 6 to 8 before the dash meets the date
We get it in in that 10 trying to get them in
That's why we all up in your hood like some spinning rims[Hook: AD3]
Look who I've become
No I'm not who I used to be
That man that you used to see
He's through me I'm not the same one
Flashy cars and jewelry
No longer are they moving me
Can't you see he's making me over
Over(4 times)
He's making me over over
And I'm not who I used to be
Get used to me
He's making me over

[Verse 1: Json]
I'm definitely not who I was but
No I'm not who I will be
But I'm becoming becoming someone who he's making me daily
Just watch and you'll see
Get used to me
Cause the man who you knew ain't no more
And the man who he is will soon be
Newly defined
Renewed in the mind
Attached to the vine as he pull me
Yes! he's making me over
Yes! my old heart man he took that
And I'm so far gone my mind has been blown
So just say that my wig has been pushed back back
I'm not settling back track
I'm not peddling that fact
Of the evident as I'm cracked cracked
Like a skeleton skeleton
Yeah so we're flipping the dime
Switching a pint of blow
Living to shine
Remember them times
But know that's not how I'm defined no more
I'm blind no more
It's time to go
I'm flying fo' sho'
They looking like how
He used to be wild and foul
He made me his child
But wow you just take a look at me now

[Hook: AD3]

[Verse 2: Json]
So let us just say
He is the potter and I am the clay
My heart is not flesh it's mushy wet yes
It's perfect for him to reshape
I'm just pottery
Dirt from the earth, just a vessel
Cursed, deserving the death yo
Was certainly a retch was made to confess
Because I've been purchased and blessed though
Now I'm living to die
They say that I'm dying to live
I'm trying to give him all I'm just part of me you should clearly that I am now his
I am now his you can keep watching me transform
And that's a truth I will stand on
And stand strong
The potter will perfectly mold when he gets his hands on
Get his hands on me
So look at the potter don't look at the pot
Look at the building don't look at the house
Look at the shepherd don't look at the flock
I belong to my God now
And I'm ready to fly now
And they looking like how
I used to be wild and foul he made me his child and wow
You just take a look at me now

[Hook: AD3]

[Verse 3: Tedashii]
My hearts been changed surgency
It's been replaced no surgery
I'm not the same different me ring that alarm emergency
Been a long time coming
But a change done finally came
Ain't that good news Sam cook I trusted in that name
Everyday, same old war
Feel ya pain say no more
The lie disguised alive fo' sho' but today's that day that I say no more
They can keep coming back but destroy me never
Hate all they want only makes me better
Trust in him with all of my givers
I ain't looking back man it's whatever
Fancy chains keep 'em
They leave me locked and beaten
Bruised up
Feeling used up
But I'm fueled up running on the power finding Jesus
And I promise that see who I am now imago dei
If I'm living than I'm living by the words he say
Running for his name till I ain't got nothing left
Sound weird how I live in him call it dub step

[Hook: AD3][Talking]
Gentlemen, prepare to lead
Release The Kracken

[Verse 1- PRo]
There is no one greater, Elohim the only creator
You sent your son to earth, He is our only Savior
You are our only maker all of the claimers are fakers
They try to take your glory; can't get any lamer!
Break out in precious jewels, wearing it look something mean
But they cheap imitations, they gon' turn yo neck green!
Wear my faith on my sleeve even if they make me bleed
Let 'em take my life, I give you all of me
Omnipotent, Omnipresent, you rule over earth and heaven
Time is on the plot as you, you see past, future and present
I don't deserve to know you, yet you give me your blessing
You made me new and gave me life, I'm forever indebted!

[Hook]
Who can be compared to you? No, I see no one greater
Who can be compared to you? No, I see no one greater
Who can be compared to you? No, I see no one greater
I-I-I see no one greater, that's why I live for the savior
Flow is not good enough, I give you all of me
They-they can take everything, I give you all of me
Itching to serve more, I give you all of me
I give you all of me
I give you all of me

[Verse 2- JSon]
Yeshua, tran-translation Jesus Christ and He's ruler
Who you got that compares to him only stands as manure
Many slashed it, blast it, bashed it, mashed it, bagged it in death
Back in passion, Passion has us in his fabulous grip
So death come on let’s go
He let em go
He made the grave breathe
Literally coughed him up
He looked back like "What?!" (?)
'Cus me for him, through him, by him, just [?] and you'll see
I denied him
Tried to fight him
His light kept drawing me
So here, take all of me
And I won't hold back no part of me
See there was nothing but dark on me
Til the Son (sun) made himself dawn on me
Now see He should blow your mind today
Li-listen to every line I say
His watch is broke
Our skies are low
Cuz he stands outside of time and space, Who's greater?!

[Hook]

[Verse 3- Trip Lee]
Hey what they think this is, think they messing with a rookie?
Now He's the Holy Spirit, you should see from where he took me
Was running from the Lord, He chased me down and then he booked me
The Father sent him out to get me, He never forsook me
The holy hound dog, the holy bounty hunter
The Lord sent him for ya? Then he's bound to hunt ya
You will be found dawg, then you'll be crown called
That mean the king's calling, knees to the ground dawg
Then you'll be runnin' to him, can't put him on the back burner
Old me, He put him in a casket turned up wormy
Put 'em in a (?)
Bling!
Raised from the dead I'm back
Seem like everything clearer like flat screens
Ever since I got dragged to the Great King

[Hook][Hook: J.R.]
Look at my life
Look at my pain
Look at my tears
These tears I shed
I feel so alone, with nobody to talk to
Cause of the days that I spend without you
It's like you're here, but you're gone (but you're gone)
You're here, but you're gone (but you're gone)
It's like you're here, but you're gone (but you're gone)
And you're gone, gone, gone, gone away

[Verse 1: J-Son]
I know you're working, I appreciate your grind
You give me everything I need, but I really want your time (I want your time)
I must confess, it's hard to express how I'm feeling
But I'm growing blocks of bitterness, quickly becoming buildings
Listen, you're never home
To the point to that I don't notice when you're gone
I'm getting older, but I'm growing all alone (I'm all alone)
How can you raise me, without even knowing me?
Everything I do, is just to get you to notice me (I miss you)
Realize, you're the great influence in my life
And you're absence just might be what's ruining my life (you're ruining my life)
I got questions, but we don't talk on the usual
My friends are having sex, and I'm wondering, should I do it too? (What should I do?)
Who should I go to, if you are never there? (Where?)
And if you never ask, will you ever be aware? (Be aware)
You say you care for me, you don't get it apparently!
I'm young and just a child, I need my parent to parent me!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: J-Son]
I know you're hustling (I know), I see you on your grind
You give me everything I need, but I really want your time (I want your time)
I stay in fresh J's, laced in new gear
But I would trade it all, if I'd only have you here
I smell the dope you be blowing, cause it be so potent
Oh yeah, I notice, but you don't think I'm a wanna smoke it? (I wanna blow)
I see your love for the streets, and I want that love too
You taught me to be hard, but you rarely tell me, "I love you" (I love you) (Please love me)
Moms be mad, she always be talking bad about you
But honestly, Dad, I don't think I'll become a man without you
And she be gone, matter of fact she never home
She come into work, and I'm living like I'm already grown
I gotta place to stay, then get ta shop at the mall
But I'll honestly say, I don't have no guidance at all
You say you care for me, but don't know I can barely read
I'm young and just a child, I need my parents to parent me!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: J-Son]
I know you're in Church, I see your love for God (I do)
You give me everything I need, but I really need your time (I need your time)
Your godly life and love for people amazes me
But tell me should the Church take my mom and my dad away from me?
I say this simply, you know a lot spiritually
Involved in ministry, but often, you don't remember me (Remember me?)
You teach the youth and show them how to model and live (Yep)
But at home you've never shown me what the Gospel is (Father I need you)
How can you share with those seem direly hopeless?
Inside I cry, cause we've never cracked the Bible open
And I'm dealing with pressure, and don't know what to do
Know what it's like to be the only Christian in your school?
I bump that 1-1-6, they tell me to live unashamed (I'm ashamed)
But that's hard when those around you are on another thing
You study thoroughly, but don't get it apparently!
I'm a babe in the faith, I need my parents to parent me!

[Hook]I’m just passing through it this ain’t my home I know it
You gotta go when deaths at your door eviction notice
Yea all Im saying its just a vapor though fading slow
So you can’t stack that paper but can’t take it though
Know its all gonna fall like Rome or that Berlin wall right
So we preach to them all Christ in the dark we them fog lights
Yea we shine see us glistening till that sky is cracked and he splitting it
We all about man his business so we walk it out we be living it
Yea had to leave my old girl she was my main squeeze
Call her cold cold world brain freeze
Now I’m guarding my zone like 2-3
I’m a saint just put a 9 on my back I’m like Drew Brees
I’m just passing but I’m not quarterbacking
See the word was a verb I’m just following his actions
This life it ain’t my own boy we here then we gone
We preach the message till the day he call us home cause we got

Chorus

One shot and then I’m gone cause I’m passing
Run until we reach the throne cause I’m passing
Shake this world on my way home cause I’m passing
Like I’m quarterbacking I’m just passing passing passing passing
Like I’m quarterbacking

Verse 2 (Serge)

A tablespoon of sugar or substitute it for Splenda
Cause I’m tryna shake this world gimme some ice, milk and a blender
Cause I’m passing, I’m dying, but before I head on out
I have to buy a calculator, ‘cause I want my life to count
I’m talking finish my mission, see because I’m a Christian
God and the glorious Gospel should be my only ambition
But sometimes I’m lowercase in different ways that I serve
So CAPS LOCK my heart till all it does is lift up your WORD
And I, will take this Gospel proclaim it to those who hate it
Debate it but some embrace it and accept propitiation
Now we ain’t learning a language, but we still tryna speak lif
Share Christ and be the salt like Lot’s wife
‘cause see if they don’t hear, then how will they believe
So see before we leave, I pray that we would be
The ones to pass it on before we see forever
Jesus strengthen me to labor and to constantly remember I got

Chorus

Verse 3 (K.B.)

Uh I don’t know what know what you heard
But I know that you notice we roll with word
Verily verily heavily versed
And not to be flexin’ our memory
But the opinions are many lets get to this work
What does God say!?
Trust me homie we can talk all day
But degrees & esteem; doesn’t mean that a thing that you think are thoughts of Yahweh/ ah wait…
You might be sincere, but you are sincerely wrong
If your position just isn’t consistent with scripture then it is
Sincerely yours & not Gods so I fight
Enough about what you like to think
What God is what God’s like
We can be wrong anywhere else but on this one we gotta be right
Who is God the Father?
Rappers love to quote his writings/ but i doubt they know the author
So If I play the martyr
Plenty of my fathers been sheep counted for slaughter
To join them would be an honor
Homie You just tell my daughter
That the word of God is worth dying for
Lets His word stand every man be a liar[Hook]
This whole world is in a sad condition
This whole world is in a sad condition
This whole world is in a sad condition
But I keep on battling on

[Verse 1 – Derek Minor]
Uh, aye, aye, good morning
The Garden where our innocence died, we're still mourning
I rolled up on your cousins like, "listen shorty you're more than
Dope boy, jump off Bentley, you are important"
But he ain't tryna listen, man he keep on cookin' rocks
Cause he tired of seeing his brother with them holes off in his socks
Momma bring these men home, his father they are not
But they touch him one more time, might just wind up getting shot
Aye, full of rage and pain, I see it in your eyes
God is their hope in all, I'm looking at the sky
Thinking if we ball, it'll change how we feel inside
But the Gospel can only change how we feel inside
Christ died for us, ultimate price for us
Didn't stay in the ground, got up and rise for us
So even if this world is broken, can't never break us
My faith isn't in it, my heart is something greater
Jehovah-jireh

[Hook]

[Intro to Verse 2: Dre Murray]
Man, I talked to this young boy the other day man
He gotta lil' paper, he think he doing somethin'
This what he told me tho..

[Verse 2 – Dre Murray]
Aye, I got a problem with myself, I think I need help
Ain't tellin' me I'm rich, I think I need wealth
I think I need the belt, baby I'm the champ
Is you seein' these jewels? Maybe that's the stamp
They call it Grade A, skipped over school, never made a grade "A"
But I'm staring at this tool that they call a AK
Don't that count for something?
Money on the scale, no I can't count for nothing
No key for my chariot, I just push a button
They call it futuristic, but I call it stuntin'
I'm just living my life
Looking out for my throne on this incredible night
One mil in my crown, what an incredible sight
You ain't never seen ten fingers shine this bright
I say hey, it's all cool, but it don't mean a thing
Cause when you die, it dies, you're an imaginary king

[Hook]

[Intro to Verse 3: Json]
It's sad, I don't know if ya'll see what we see
But, let me talk to em'
Look

[Verse 3 – Json]
I'm from the hood where they mask up, strap talk to get cash up
Crack flippin' that trap bruh, act tough and get clapped up
Yeah, where bodies rot, yeah you can smell death
They say the block is hot, I say that's hell's breath
Dreads all in they hair, kush smoke in that air
Window into his soul, you can see the pain in his stare
Uh, since he's a young'un his momma has been the geeker
On the streets where, where you could just die for a pair of sneakers
They like, "look you can be whatever," "lil homie sky's the limit"
Make it about the hood, but he just see peeps dying in it
All around's him destruction, that's the norm for his family
Tore down his projects, now all that he's known is abandoned
Sadly he's been conditioned that this has to be livin'
Tell him do better, you'll have to supply a definition
What's even sadder, internally he is broke
Nobody that'll show that in Jesus should be his hope
And that's sad...

[Hook]

[Verse 4 – Viktory]
Blinded by the world, we stumble cause it's all dark
Never thought that I would be tempted to fall hard
Simple man, yeah, and life is real as ever
I study him to learn exactly how he did it better
Perfect, not a flaw, not a mistake
I used to shine bright, now I'm just praying I don't break
Erosion over time, my cleats turn to skates
The stress from my slides, you can see it in my face
Grace is all I'm leaning on these days
I crossed the road and sinners comin' from each way
Save me, oh wretched man I am
Without these nails in your feet, I don't know how to stand
Without these nails in your hands, I don't know who I am
Help me turn from this lust, get me out of this jam
My soul's at stake, and I could die tonight
Chartered the king and he hit me with that private flight

[Hook]

[Intro to Verse 5: Tedashii]
This world man, it's sad bruh
Ain't nobody carin'
That's how my grandma would tell me

[Verse 5 – Tedashii]
Stuck in the sphere of what's near, sad conditions keep me here
Tried outer space, I'm out of place, and I can't breathe up in that atmosphere
Every minute that I'm in it, feel the pressure thicken
Take my diesel from this scene and this preventing me from breathing
So I say where I'm from, outside the box don't feel like home
I wish it did cause where I live will be this way till I'm gone
Conscious students acting foolish, learning to be unruly
See these pupils taking light, folks die for what they refusin'
Yeah, movie theater massacres, same-sex marriages
Preacher choked their children out and then they wanna pastor us
Plus I did dirt, yeah, hard intent to hurt all
Friends to me, enemies, millionaire, slum dog
Hustle man, no Martin man, just tryna find a come-up quick
Sad condition, heart is sick, sadly man I'm loving it
Need to get up out this world, packing for a rocket ship
God ain't sent a rocket, but he sent his Son, I'm outta here[Verse 1: Flame]
See a song like this is so vintage
So authentic and there’s no gimmick
And by the First Amendment I'm free to speak
About an ancient King from the Middle East
He's the Lion, the Lamb, the "I am" from Zion
They Crucified Him, that's so defiant
And the first of the Ten Commandments been abandoned
Look at man and there is no reliance
There is slow compliance, or no compliance
I know they hate it I get it, I get (I get it, I get it)
But who resurrected? He did it, He did it
He layed His life down and took it up
2000 years plus, now look at us
Christianity spread, gang of bloodshed for us, go and look it up
And I ain't tryna be a tough guy, and I ain't tryna be a martyr either
And I ain't got the "kill me" complex, I just wanna be just like Jesus
When it's my time to go, I wanna die with grace
I wanna die with faith, knowing that I'm bout to see His face
Wanna be filled with the Spirit and no longer fear
I'm living for You Lord as long as I'm here

[Hook: Thi'sl]
You can take my life! (x6)
You can take my (x4)
You can take my life! (6)
You can take my (x4)
You can take my life
[Verse 2: Json]
Said he'll take my life, I said go ahead and take it
Tell me how I'm gon' lose it? Christ already saved it
He said "I'm gon' cock back I'mma let it fly for that bullseye"
I said "Cool, I got clear sight and my lamp's on for that full ride," (that full ride)
So go on and take my life, I'mma lay it down where that ground at
Where that ground at? On that ground flat, same place where that crown at
For every soldier that's chained up, chained up that's been locked down
Church boy, church girl, youth group that's getting mocked now
Christ is still with us, He said He wouldn't leave us
He promised us all (He promised us all)
They'll mock us, they'll shoot us, they'll lock us
I promise they won't stop our souls
Won't stop our souls, death is just sleep for me
We got the victory, cock and reload
Death where yo stinging be? we still believe and the Rock is our fortress
He got us fo’ sho’
We refusing to stand down, ‘cuz faith's why we stand up
If faith's in your heart now, everybody get your hands up
'Cuz He makes my life, He could break my life
He could shake my life, if He want to
He can take my, He can take my life

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Thi'sl]
I had this vision I was locked up in this Middle Eastern prison
Guards all around me, they strapped up like something serious
All the guards, they got guns, look like I'm losin'
They ask me did I love Jesus before they start shooting
Holes all in my body, blood over my body
We all know how this gon' go, I ain't waking up in a Bugatti (in a new Bugatti)
If I make it to that place, Jesus hold me close
Take my fear, Lord fill me with your Holy Ghost
That's for my brotha’s over in the Middle East, that dyin off in them streets
They runnin' up in they house at night putting the heat to 'em while they sleep
And it's all for the Cross, 'cuz they boldly proclaim His name (they proclaim His name)
They ain't scared of the guns, they ain't scared of the jails or the chains
(We ain't scared of the chains)
This for Africa, Syria and Afghanistan
Every soldier that lost they life all the way over to Pakistan
They could close our eyes, but they cannot dim our light
Cuz we signed up to die
You can take my, You can take my life

[Hook][Verse 1 – Lecrae]
Yeah … walked out of his home, different time zone
Lives in eternity, now he’s living in time zones?
This is mind blowing, God of the universe
Knows every star in the sky to my human hurts
Made the trees, made the breeze
Made the seas, emcees like J and me
But let me tell you what amazes me
How he came as a man who was made to need
Hungered and thirsted
And the very same earth that he cursed, he’s now fully immersed in
Look at his work, he’s God to be exalted
But he came and lived with people falling and faulted
I hope you get it homes
Only a God who’s perfect in love would ever leave his throne for some skin and bones
It’s hard to live just breathing to death
When the same God that made you is breathing your breath

[Hook – Json & Lecrae]
Who is he?
God in the flesh who was tested
Who came manifested, was killed, resurrected
Who are you?
Do you even know who you are?
Created to know the God who created the stars
Who is he?
He was, he is, he will be
Death couldn’t hold him and neither shall death seal me
Who are you?
You’re better off never existing if you don’t trust the God of the Scriptures
You listenin’?

[Verse 2 – Json]
Can you imagine God in the flesh? Invisible seen as visible
Infinite seeming finite, spirit becoming physical
It’s odd man, God man slept and obeyed
The earth’s confines, to breathe the very breath that he made
He would sweat, he would weep, even eat for his hunger
Defeat death within three, so we’d see that he’s stronger
Could give us anything even offer us wealth
That wouldn’t be love if he ain’t offer himself
So he stepped down from his throne and removed his crown
And touched ground, though he knew he would be bruised and bound
He is now and then next and later on
And still is what me and Crae can’t convey in this song
Though our minds can never reason this thang
The question is: do you really see him the same?
And if you see him as sane, as the living God and matchless Christ
How much do these truths impact your life?

[Hook – Json & Lecrae]

[John Piper]
In order for Jesus to suffer and die, he had to plan way ahead of time, because … he couldn’t die. Immortal. He didn’t have any body, yet he wanted to die … for you. So he planned the whole thing by clothing himself with a body so that he could get hungry and get weary and get sore feet. The incarnation is the preparation of nerve endings for the nails – the preparation of a brow for thorns to press through. He needed to have a broad back so that there was a place for the whip. He needed to have feet so that there was a place for spikes. He needed to have a side so that there was a place for the sword to go in. He needed fleshy cheeks so that Judas would have a place to kiss and there would be a place for the spit to run down that the soldiers put on him. He needed a brain and a spinal column with no vinegar and no gall so that the exquisiteness of the pain could be fully felt. I just plead with you – when you’re reading the bible and you read water toy texts like “he loved you” and “gave himself for you,” you wouldn’t go too fast over it. Linger, linger, linger, and plead with him that your eyes would be opened[Verse 1 – Json]
Your back to the wall (wall), you feelin’ the hurt (hurt)
Your head to the sky (sky), your knees to the dirt (dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt)
Why when we going through it right in that moment then
Do we begin to believe that the moment won’t end?
After the sun sets, then won’t the sun rise?
After the rain pours, then won’t the sun shine?
Look at them mothers, pain felt in delivery
Who hears her babies cry and the pain becomes a memory
Yeah, I just wanna remind you
Your now will be a then, you’ll just look at behind you
Surely the God of all glory
Will take me, break me, and then he’ll restore me (store me)
Hey, so when the sky’s looking gray above
Know his grave was dug just so we can taste his love
Yeah, so stop trying to dodge the raindrops
Hide under his wings and watch the rain stop

[Chorus – Chris Lee]
At the dawn of every new day
Lies a proof that night will fade
And just like a mother forgets her pain
When she sees her baby’s face
As she holds her smile
And the joy my heart contains
Makes it all worthwhile
Even when rain is falling down
You shine behind the clouds

Na na na, na na na, na na na
Na na na na na, na na na …
Whooaaaohh …
Na na na, na na na, na na na
Na na na na na, na na na …
You shine behind the clouds

[Verse 2 – Json]
When it seems like dark clouds are following ya
Know, the very rain makes the trees grow
Oh, as you’re attached to the vine and pruning may hurt
You don’t know what he’s doing at first
He’s truly at work, so you just look the pain in its face
As his strength will carry you through displaying his grace
The favor of faith, you just watch the praise when you’re done
‘Cause after the storms of death came the rays of the sun

[Chorus – Chris Lee]
At the dawn of every new day
Lies a proof that night will fade
And just like a mother forgets her pain
When she sees her baby’s face
As she holds her smile
And the joy my heart contains
Makes it all worthwhile
Even when rain is falling down
You shine behind the clouds

[Bridge – Chris Lee]
Some days this life involves
Things that challenge my heart
You don’t change that’s why I’m staying
You’re with me through it all
So my joy will never leave
‘Cause it provides the strength I need
When it seems the pain won’t go away …

[Chorus – Chris Lee]
At the dawn of every new day
Lies a proof that night will fade
And just like a mother forgets her pain
When she sees her baby’s face
As she holds her smile
And the joy my heart contains
Makes it all worthwhile
Even when rain is falling down
You shine behind the clouds

[Chorus – Chris Lee]
At the dawn of every new day
Lies a proof that night will fade
And just like a mother forgets her pain
When she sees her baby’s face
As she holds her smile
And the joy my heart contains
Makes it all worthwhile
Even when rain is falling down
You shine behind the clouds

Na na na, na na na, na na na
Na na na na na, na na na …
You shine behind the clouds …
Na na na, na na na, na na na
Na na na na na, na na na …
Whooaaaohh …
Na na na, na na na, na na na
Na na na na na, na na na …
You shine behind the clouds[Hook]
You ain’t growin’ up boy, you just gettin’ older
You ain’t growin’ up boy, you just gettin’ older
A boy in a man’s body, you ain’t doin’ nothin’
I know who you is, boy you’re Benjamin Button

[Verse 1]
Grew up as a young ‘un in them city streets
Where the blind leading the blind at
You know what, they die young
But so what, they grow old, not grow up, it’s like a time lapse
But that’s just how it is though
But he don’t wanna die, he just don’t know what it is to live though
‘Cause daddy dipped when he was a kid
He’s still alive but in his heart it’s like he never lived
In hell is hurt, that’s just his pain
At night his mom can’t pay the bills, she prayin’ something change
Gas electric, electric gas
Them the choices that you make when you ain’t got no cash
Tired of asking his momma for stuff he know he can’t have
So he pitchin’ in, he gettin’ it, you can find him out on that Ave
Sleeping with the gorillas, and wrestling with them bears
Average life span’s around 25, around here them boys they don’t care … I’m like

[Hook]
You ain’t growin’ up boy, you just gettin’ older
You ain’t growin’ up boy, you just gettin’ older
A boy in a man’s body, you ain’t doin’ nothin’
I know who you is, boy you’re Benjamin Button
Benjamin Button, boy you’re Benjamin Button
Say you’re Benjamin Button, boy you’re Benjamin Button
Say you’re Benjamin Button, boy you’re Benjamin Button
Say you’re Benjamin Button … you just gettin’ older

[Verse 2]
Grew up as a young girl in them city streets
Where the blind leading the blind at
You know what, they die young
But so what, they grow old, not grow up, it’s like a time lapse
Momma clubbin’, daddy thuggin’, you know what they on
It’s like he here but he gone, but that’s another song
She thinks she grown, she just 16 going on 30
Since daddy left, she vowed “I’ll never let a man hurt me”
Heard me? Gucci, Louis, Fendi, Prada
So she just use a man for a dollar, makin’ him holler
Pretty face, body the flown
Use what she got, get what she want
Just a child raised by a child, momma was just a baby
Having a baby, nobody taught her to be a lady
Now she a baby with a baby, look at how she lived
Full grown, but living like she a kid, gettin’ older

[Hook]
You ain’t growin’ up boy, you just gettin’ older
You ain’t growin’ up boy, you just gettin’ older
A boy in a man’s body, you ain’t doin’ nothin’
I know who you is, boy you’re Benjamin Button
Benjamin Button, Benja-Benjamin Button
Benjamin Button, boy you’re Benjamin Button
Benjamin Button, boy you’re Benjamin Button
Say you’re Benjamin Button … you just gettin’ older

[Bridge]
When you say you’re grown, you ain’t grown ‘cause of timing
It’s ‘cause you put them childish things behind you
When you say you’re grown, you ain’t grown ‘cause of timing
It’s ‘cause you put them childish things behind you
(Repeat)

[Verse 3]
I grew up as a young ‘un in them city streets
Where the blind leading the blind at
You know what, they die young
But so what, they grow old, not grow up, it’s like a time lapse
That’s how it is when every man that you know
In the hood whippin’ good ‘cause he pushin’ that blow
And so we move how he move, man you already know
Till the Lord touched my soul, homie I wasn’t grown, just gettin’ older …

[Hook]
You ain’t growin’ up boy, you just gettin’ older
You ain’t growin’ up boy, you just gettin’ older
A boy in a man’s body, you ain’t doin’ nothin’
I know who you is, boy you’re Benjamin Button
Benjamin Button, Benja-Benjamin Button
Benjamin Button, boy you’re Benjamin Button
Benjamin Button, boy you’re Benjamin Button
Say you’re Benjamin Button … you just gettin’ olderIt's over let the credits roll

I got this hurt in my heart I'm feeling from the filth and the pain
It pours fast, it's only rain in my forecast
I'm just buried in guilt
I can't look to your face
I'm rejecting forgiveness
I'm just running from grace
All my mistakes is so heavy I can't carry the load
And I can't see the beyond behind me is crushing my soul
Past feels like the present just can't seem to let it go
Why do I feel indebted when my debt's already paid for, for so

So even when you know it's over
Tell me why you always want to rewind
So much light in front of you
It's over let the credits roll
Let 'em roll
Let 'em roll
It's over let the credits roll
Let 'em roll
Let 'em roll
It's over let the credits roll
Let 'em just let 'em roll man
Let 'em just let 'em roll man
Let 'em just let 'em roll man
Let 'em just let 'em roll man

Give me the scraps
I don't deserve to feast from your table
But Christ died for the broken, frail, weak and disabled
Meaning me, so I will not accept the sacrifice
Do I think my righteousness comes in when I'm just acting right? Nahhh
Just believe and confess
And your sins tossed in the sea far as the east from the west
Yes past, present and future
Future, present and past
Adios amigo
All my sins tossed in the trash trash yea

Even when you know it's over
Tell me why you always want to rewind
So much light in front of you
It's over let the credits roll
Let 'em roll
Let 'em roll
It's over let the credits roll
Let 'em roll
Let 'em roll
It's over let the credits roll

Why settle for less?
Get off the floor no eating scraps
When it all fails you
You see the joy it did not last
He's prepared a feast for us regardless of our past
So don't get lost
Just keep on following the map

Even when you know it's over
Tell me why you always want to rewind
So much light in front of you
It's over let the credits roll
Let 'em roll
Let 'em roll
It's over let the credits roll
Let 'em roll
Let 'em roll
It's over let the credits roll

Age 16, young and bad I ain't had no curfew
With dudes older than me, couldn't see being in church dude
Instead, I'm in the street with a heart like night
Like maybe I'm like Jay-Z living the hard knock life
Eyes, scarred by light - I'd rather chop and slang
Pop and hang, be schooled how to cock and aim
Looking back my eyes had to be blurry like glass tint
In the rush for my demise, thank God that's the past tense
Lord, I pray the youth will hear the truth in these words
Actually all is vanity outside of you that I serve
Yes! Even this music's a heavenly melody
From the Father telling me to quote to you what he said to me
If I wasn't embedded with the Spirit he fed to me
Life love and joy as I know it'd only be dead to me
But I was resurrected with Christ, the kingdom's prepared for me
If you receive and believe it's a joy you can share with me
Come on!

[Chorus - J.R.]
Amazing Grace
I once was blind but now
Your grace has let me see
Thank God I've been redeemed
Amazing Grace
I once was lost but now
By your grace now I'm found
Praise God I've been redeemed

[Verse 2 - Json]
The Lord doesn't hurt your position, true repentance will get you out of that state
Escape the hand of his wrath, receive the plan of his grace
Listen, I know it seems like the world has a lot it could offer you
And because of it its hard for you to hear that he's calling you
Let me talk to you about the void that you feel
You try to replace it with things but the joy isn't real
I had that, filled myself with the fame and the money
And all my quest was still stressed ‘cause my flesh it remained hungry
The pain was there, through all the herb I was cheefing
It was plain it would be the same until I fervently seeked him
Then seeked him, then saw the urgency of me and my sin
It's an emergency we believe upon him
Look, dawg I'm knowing that the streets is real
And them dudes carry heat for real, listen to me for real
God, he is realer than that
Receive him before he really comes back, cause that's what real
Come on!

[Chorus - J.R.]
Amazing Grace
I once was blind but now
Your grace has let me see
Thank God I've been redeemed
Amazing Grace
I once was lost but now
By your grace now I'm found
Praise God I've been redeemed

[Verse 3 - Json]
Lord, my earnest prayer is for my family tree
Cause it would be (timber!) without you standing with me
I pray, somehow that they would get a glimpse or a picture
Consistent conviction whenever we'll mention the Scripture
Hell is hot, I can't give a drop on the tongue
And in the streets, believe you can leave at the cock of a gun
My homies: this world ain't it, please put your eyes to the light
Cause who's my mother, who's my brother if their lives ain't in Christ?
I guess, Matthew 10 and 34 is the key
What he came to be, ‘cause there's this war between you and me
Fam, I love you but you're on that side of the fence
I just wish he'd quicken your heart, cause I can try to convince
I cry and insist, but without the tears on my cheeks
For years I would weep, praying you would hear when he speaks
Sincere with my speech, if you opened your ears I could reach
I've been sent here to preach through this song here with the beats, so listen

[Chorus - J.R.]
Amazing Grace
I once was blind but now
Your grace has let me see
Thank God I've been redeemed
Amazing Grace
I once was lost but now
By your grace now I'm found
Praise God I've been redeemedYeah! These are our growing pains
Let's go

Look at my soul, then look at my heart
Then look at my scars and look at my face
Look at the cross and look at His palms
Look at them thorns, you're looking at grace yeah
So when he's allowing pain it's afflicting me
I'm just simmering I'm more tender meat, rotisserie
He'll take me out when he's ready though it seems awful long
At the end I'm better seasoned, flesh falling off the bones
But I know what it's like when I'm crushed
Because of my bad decisions bars
Minus the track listing, package ripped, no merry Christmas
He's whispering
I'm hearing my enemy telling me foe
But I've been picked up cause of his mercy
So it's my Lord that's telling me no
Telling me watch, telling me run
Telling me fight, telling me go
Tell me keep guard, look at The Son
After the pain then I will grow
So, just know that I'm reading when water's banging up on my levy
The Rock, He got me, He'll spot me
Whenever the load is heavy
And it's for certain just know it
That living for is worship or promise this hurting
Suffering truly has a purpose
We'll grow

I will go through the pain
I will fight through the dark
Walk with me as it rains
As you break me apart
But I need you to help me
I need you to help me
I need you to help me
I need you to help me
I will grow through the pain
Through the pain I will grow
I will grow through the pain
Through the pain I will grow
I will grow through the pain
Through the pain I will grow
I will grow through the pain
Through the pain I will growChrist he backslapped sin and choke slammed death
The real Rock, then he put the grave in a headlock
And they all had to tap out ‘cause it's all been mapped out
The words like Pro Tools, you'll see the whole thing tracked out
But when I say I get it from him, y'all don't hear me though
But trust that's why I wrestle my sin like Rey Mysterio
See Christians should be showing the word closed caption
Why you like a romance comedy, no action
Real Christians please stand up, go'n ‘head and man up
Even if they blam blam us let's stand there like "and what?"
We on lockdown homie, you see them handcuffs?
We run the race with full horsepower, call us a Ram truck

If you riding through the streets
If you nodding to this beat
I hope you see that I'm alive because he died to set me free
It's the Christ
Who then saved who then raised who then made me
It's the Christ
Who then saved who then raised who then made me
If you riding through the streets
If you nodding to this beat
I hope you see that I'm alive because he died to set me free
It's the Christ
Who then saved who then raised who then made me
It's the Christ
Who then saved who then raised who then made me

I found out I couldn't save myself all I had was dead words
I died to follow Christ and jumped in the grave head first
See he bled worst, the Rock is divine
Made me a transformer, Optimus Prime
Changed my whole frame up, slayed the grave
And made your boy get low like a razor fade
All that to say he humbled me and daily he will crumble me
Till the day he comes for me making me what he wants to see
I know what want from me, relax yourself
Now add it up, now what you get when you subtract yourself?
I couldn't handle the grave, his wrath was to much trouble
Christ the sacrifice stood in CUT Stunt Double

If you riding through the streets
If you nodding to this beat
I hope you see that I'm alive because he died to set me free
It's the Christ
Who then saved who then raised who then made me
It's the Christ
Who then saved who then raised who then made me
If you riding through the streets
If you nodding to this beat
I hope you see that I'm alive because he died to set me free
It's the Christ
Who then saved who then raised who then made me
It's the Christ
Who then saved who then raised who then made me

That's why I spit bars of life, you can get life in these bars
Right now, like you doin' a bid in Riker Island
Got punchlines of truth, ad-libs of his glory
Overdubs of love we spit to give him glory
Look, me ain't my focus my boasting's dead
But I know I'm easy to crush like a loaf of bread
So I rhyme about the blood covered over my head
Took the cross off my neck, it's on my shoulder instead
Your boy dead and I only wanna model Him
All I do is retweet every since I have followed Him
My life homie that's been purchased
Find out that ya boy bleed Christ if you just scratch the surface

If you riding through the streets
If you nodding to this beat
I hope you see that I'm alive because he died to set me free
It's the Christ
Who then saved who then raised who then made me
It's the Christ
Who then saved who then raised who then made me
If you riding through the streets
If you nodding to this beat
I hope you see that I'm alive because he died to set me free
It's the Christ
Who then saved who then raised who then made me
It's the Christ
Who then saved who then raised who then made meI'm praying for his soul Lord (prayin)
You was my road dog, and truly one of the reasons that it was so hard (it's a strain on me)
You held me down when I had nothing but dust
To see you stuck in the same things is leaving me crushed

In my mind, throughout time, I drew a line wit you
‘cause our hearts have grown apart but please let me surmise wit ya (please!)
I pray these rhymes hit ya, cause we did everything from suffer to grind
I remembered flipping through my mind's pictures (remember?)

But now its different, I can't hurt but be fake
I see you and see through to hurt on your face (spit clear)
I wake - I been in that place where you feeling your heart's a void
You look at your life and your feeling more dark than joy

But you won't see it till you see that your ya' own threat
You play the cards your dealt but dealing from the wrong deck
So I wrote this to say I love you and all
But my deepest desire is to see you come to the Lord

I love you I do! Love you enough to tell you the truth
Couldn't, say it in person, hope its felt from the booth
With every heartbeat your still a part of me
I pray that you turn today with (incomprehensible) the Lord and me

I know it's hard to see, but God He wants to heal you life
Right now you only breath, God He wants to heal you life
But you won't find it if you trustin' in things
Trust me, you'll only find it if you trust in the King

Mama, besides my wife you're the closest person to me, though I lack to express this
Yes I regret it, cause you should know your highly respected
I love you deeply, and if I had to give you a life description
You're a realist, and a strong woman despite your addiction

I see my need for your forgiveness the more I embrace the Book
Cause I didn't paint the whole picture in this song come take a look (I'm sorry)
In fact it was my selfishness and desire for things
That made me resent you and not truly see you as a queen (you are)

And I apologize with feelings too sincere to describe
I pray you're hearing my cries, I write with tears in my eyes
For the past years I've cried, the hardest thing in my life
Is to give the Gospel to my mother, see you surrender to Christ

Throughout your life you been through a lot that were heartache and pain
You lost a daughter in the game ma, its time for a change
It's plan I wrote this to say I love you and all
But my deepest desire is to see you come to the Lord

I love you I do! Love you enough to tell you the truth
Couldn't, say it in person, hope its felt from the booth
With every heartbeat your still a part of me
I pray that you turn today with (incomprehensible) the Lord and me

I write to you both, because I know we rarely had a time to talk
And when we do its hard to say to you what's truly on my heart
I felt pressed by the Lord with a need to address it
Plus if I love you how can I not share with you the Gospel message?

It's deeper than you being my mother, bigger than you being my fam
We're talking God, Creator of the seas and the land
Man has a problem with Him ‘cause of our sin
We can't change on our own ‘cause we're in love with our sin

But, God sent His Son to live the perfect life we couldn't live
Jesus Christ gave the sacrifice we couldn't give
His arms are open to show you what life's meaning is
There's none righteous, that's why we in need of His

What's grieving is you don't truly see that He's the treasure
You put your hope in things, they won't bring eternal pleasure (Why?)
God loves you I hope you hearing the call
Cause my deepest desire is to see you come to the Lord

I love you I do! Love you enough to tell you the truth
Couldn't, say it in person, hope its felt from the booth
With every heartbeat your still a part of me
I pray that you turn today with (incomprehensible) the Lord and me

I love you I do
