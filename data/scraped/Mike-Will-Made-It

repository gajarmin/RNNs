[Intro: Swae Lee]
Yah, bad bitches is the... yah

[Hook: Swae Lee]
I don't got no type
Bad bitches is the only thing that I like
You ain't got no life
Cups with the ice and we do this every night
I ain't check the price
I make my own money, so I spend it how I like
I'm just livin' life
And let my mama tell it, nigga, I ain't livin' right

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Chop the top off the Porsche, that's a headless horse
Extendo long as an extension cord
Bitch, I ball like Jordan and I play full court
And if you not my type then you know I got to keep this shit short
What you know about a check? What you got up in your pocket?
What you spending when you shopping, dawg?
Why you wanna go flex? Like you all in the mix
Like you got some shit popping off
I got some models that you see up in the movies
And they want to make a flick for the camera
Wanna be Kim Kardashian, heard I was livin' like a bachelor

[Hook: Swae Lee]
I don't got no type
Bad bitches is the only thing that I like
You ain't got no life
Cups with the ice and we do this every night
I ain't check the price
I make my own money, so I spend it how I like
I'm just livin' life
And let my mama tell it, nigga, I ain't livin' right

[Verse 2: Slim Jimmy]
Spend it how I like, sinnin' every night
Push start the whip, brought it straight to life
Blowin' on the kush, 'til I'm out of sight
I don't check the price, all I do is swipe
She said, "What's your type?", I said, "I like what I like"
I don't second guess, I just roll the dice (keep it moving)
Keep your two cents, take your own advice
I've been livin' life, like I lived twice

[Hook: Swae Lee]
I don't got no type
Bad bitches is the only thing that I like
You ain't got no life
Cups with the ice and we do this every night
I ain't check the price
I make my own money, so I spend it how I like
I'm just livin' life
And let my mama tell it, nigga, I ain't livin' right

[Outro]
I don't got no type, I don't got no type
And let my mama tell it, nigga, I ain't livin' right[Verse 1: Slim Jimmy]
I've done it before, I've seen it before
Tears splashin' the floor when I open the door for her
She actin' like a whore and I'ma let her
Learned from Project Pat, pimpin', got a masters
Girl, improvise, look me in my eyes and lie to me
Lie to me, act like I'll believe anything
Sex on the beach and in the backseat
This could be us

[Hook: Swae Lee]
So back to what I was saying
(Money make the world go 'round)
This could be us, but you're playing
(Money make your girl go down)
This could be us, but you're playing
(Money make the world go 'round)
I'm high, hope I don't sound crazy
(Money make your girl go down)
Fuck what them niggas was saying
(Money make the world go 'round)
This could be us, but you're playing
(Money make your girl go down)
This could be us, but you're playing
(Money make the world go 'round)
But shit, that's all I was saying
(Money make your girl go down)

[Verse 2: Swae Lee]
No keys to crank this Mercedes
I ball like Tracy McGrady
Before that girl says anything
She gotta say please (say please)
And I know they really wish we would ball 'til we fall
I'm the big bad wolf, it's a full moon, y'all
Toss the money in the air
Watch how your dreams hit the floor
Wait 'til I get the buzz off this drug
Damn girl, you way too fine for a local club
Killin' someone's vibe should be a fuckin' crime
Wasted so much time, should be a fuckin' crime

[Hook: Swae Lee]
So back to what I was saying
(Money make the world go 'round)
This could be us, but you're playing
(Money make your girl go down)
This could be us, but you're playing
(Money make the world go 'round)
I'm high, hope I don't sound crazy
(Money make your girl go down)
Fuck what them niggas was saying

(Money make your girl go down)
This could be us, but you're playing
(Money make the world go 'round)
But shit, that's all I was saying
(Money make your girl go down)

[Bridge: Swae Lee]
Spin the bottle, spin the fuckin' bottle
If you the reason why it's empty, baby
Spin the bottle
Truth or dare, nah, you don't want no problem
Spin the bottle, spin the fuckin' bottle
If you the reason why it's empty, spin the fuckin' bottle
Truth or dare, no, no, you don't want no problem
You don't want no problem, bitch, you must want problems

[Hook: Swae Lee]
So back to what I was saying
(Money make the world go 'round)
This could be us, but you're playing
(Money make your girl go down)
This could be us, but you're playing

[Hook: Nicki Minaj]
Ass fat, yeah I know
You just got cash? Blow sum mo'
Blow sum mo', blow sum mo'
The more you spend it, the faster it go
Bad bitches, on the floor
It's rainin' hundreds, throw sum mo'
Throw sum mo', throw sum mo'
Throw sum mo', throw sum mo'

[Verse 1: Slim Jimmy]
Slim Jimmy!
Hi, bye hater, I flood the club with paper
Shorty got a ass, some for now, some for later
Somethin' like Nicki's, dancin' like Maliah
I'm throwin' all this money, I'mma fuck around and buy her
I can flick the money all night, 'til my wrist tired
If you put in work, this the night you gon' retire
You a bad bitch, I ain't even gon' deny her
She told me, "throw that money," I said, "make it worth my while"
I'm 'bout to empty out the ATM
She doin' tricks that make a nigga wanna spend
Girl, you know you got me fascinated
Just keep on dancin' 'til I'm outta paper
(Never!)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Swae Lee]
Franklin's rainin' on your body
Rainin' on your body, rainin' on your body
Won't you do what I say, start rubbin' on your body
You like hundred's on your body, girl, you need to get naughty
Hold up, hold on, her eyes on me, is that your ho?
If so I'mma get her 'fore the nights over
DJ play my shit so I'm finna crank up off in the VIP zone
See the money go up and she dance on sight
By the end of the night she on endo
Lemme see you make it clap on tempo
Lemme see you get low like limbo

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Come here ho, mistletoe, I got birdies, crows
Lil bitty bitch wanna jump on the dick
I'm like bool, let's get it, let's get it
I got these bitches kissin' on these bitches
I can't even count 'em, I fuck by the digits
Swag terrific, I might fuck this bitch in the kitchen
Baby, don't use dirty dishes, or else you might whip up a BURRRR!
My neck, my wrist is a BURRRR!
She wanna fuck my dogs, I'm like woof
Panoramic roof, I drop the coupe, boo
Pull up with a bitch, she look like New New
It's okay if I lie to you, bitch, my swag the truth
Hey, she come right back, that's what them diamonds do
Fifty thousand off fifty niggas, no caliber, bitch

[Hook][Hook]
I always wanted to stunt so hard
I always wanted to ride that whip
I always wanted to fuck that bitch
Thank you, God, I fucked that bitch
I always wanted to live this life
I always wanted to wear that ice
I always wanted a paradise
I always wanted a paradise

[Bridge 1]
Look, now it don't take a lot to make you rich
I'm addicted to a lot of crazy shit
Man, I feel like money is the best drug
Sometimes hate can be the best love

[Verse 1]
Walkin' in like I got cameras on me
Niggas can't control me, ain't no handles on me
Shit don't get out of hand, it get handled, homie
Got a pretty young girl look like Janet on me
She a pretty penny and she know I'm doing numbers
Till we crash up the whole database
I bring it home like I'm base to base to base
Closet lookin' like Planet of the Bathing Apes
What you think this life just landed on me?
My whole city look like it's abandoned, homie
And we came straight out of those abandoned homes
Every wish we ever had got granted, homie
And I'll never take that shit for granted
Even when the marble floor and counter top is all granite
Back before I got paid any advances
Back when my rollie was ticking, no dancing
Nigga, never did I slip or I panic
Even if I was the captain of Titanic
Riding through the north Atlantic, homie
I never jumped crew or abandoned, homie
All the fruits of my labor organic, homie
Making sure my family tree got hammocks on it
And a good guy can change, 'specially if he short-changed
So fuck is my ransom, homie?

[Bridge 2 (x4)]
Money bag, money bag, money bag

[Hook]

[Interlude]
Straight up, Finally Famous, nigga
Aw damn, damn

[Verse 2]
Aw damn, I'm illuminated, man, I knew I make it
And I get that shit accumulated
Never throwing money out, I boomerang it
Finally famous over everything, that's a numerator
Weed lit, yeah, it's luminated, room lookin' like it's fumigated
Bitch, my crew invaded, when I walk in, man, they body to body
Hol' up everybody, don't worry, man, I got it, I got it
I need a hundred dollar bill, photocopy the email and copy
Man, I'm going hard all season
These hoes goin' both ways, offense, defense
Livin' life on the deep end, F-F allegiance
Beat the odds and got even
What you think, that we just started, nigga?
Boy, the sword just got sharper, nigga
This ain't war, we just sparring, nigga
I was on the rooftop with my nigga Mike Carson, nigga
Shootin' that "Too Fake" video, my nigga, we all in
We set ourselves apart from all our apartments
Was up in Florida, no Marlins, nigga
I'm that Shawn, no Marlon, nigga
Look at my girl nigga, fuck yo' bae list
Fuck yo' night list, fuck yo' day list, fuck yo' playlist
I'm from the D, fuck your A-list
I been working 8 days a week
I don't even know what the fuck today is
I hit the booth and I just went super saiyan
I run with the purp like I play with the Ravens
These bitches rant and rave
I hope I never have to go back watching
Everybody Loves Raymond
Eating ramen, nigga, this paradise
Life's a fucking paradox and pair of dice
If they not rolling with you, then they parasites nigga
I had that vision, it was ClearSight, nigga, Sean Don[Intro]
Somebody come to the floor, it feels like we've met before

[Hook: Swae Lee]
Somebody come get her, she's dancin' like a stripper
Somebody come get her, she's dancin' like a stripper
Somebody come tip her, she's dancin' like a stripper
Somebody come get her, she's feelin' all the liquor

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Chopped and screwed up
I'm a pothead, true enough
At your ex's crib and you're boo'd up
Take it slow baby, we in no rush
Hennessy or Don Q, that's a very hard choice
For the diamonds on my pinky, need a gang of cool points
And the drop head make 'em drop dead, yeah
Ye ain't scared, ye ain't scared, ye ain't scared, yeah
Believe me, I'm out here, you see me, in action
I've heard a lot, a lot about you
Passin' round blunts like a hot potato
And you dancin' on the table, gushin' like volcano

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Slim Jimmy]
You got girls in here? I'm recruitin'
And they fine, hop the line
I've been sippin' on Patrón and wine
I'm just tryna have a good fuckin' time
I was chillin' with the open container
Grabbed her arm, told her not to be a stranger
I was throwin' on the drank with my niggas
I was lookin' for the girls who willin'
Baby girl, if you fuck with me then we gettin' bands
If you smokin' with me then we on dabs
I don't fuck with local hoes, I told you that
How you movin', you deserve a couple racks

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Swae Lee]
Hundreds on your face, baby girl
Come and do that little thing that you was doin'
Aye they was in this mothafucka trippin'
What the hell they think we was doin'?
It seems like we're fuckin' in this club
Baby girl, what they think that we're doin'?
You gettin' on my nerves with them questions
Girl you know I'm tryna start a little movement
I ain't got no business fuckin' with you
Out the blue, you actin' brand new
Washingtons mean nothing to you
Same way with us

Mr. T, them rings on, say my fucking name, ho
Yeah, them diamonds so cool, yeah, that old school mine, fool
Never heard about you, all my hoes, they so rude
Tats all on me, nigga, trill-ass individual
Go and check on that nigga, sit on my Balmain zipper
Got a airtight schedule, fuck your bitch, just met her
Pink slip, no rental,got a L full of that killer
Beating on my chest like Magilla
Nigga, I am the gorilla of the village
Pack sound like heavy metal
Just killed the haters, God bless them

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Slim Jimmy]
Young niggas got to get to the money
Five chains, so they look at me funny
Showed up with the juice and the troops
Roll a seven every time I shoot
She said, "Why you got so many condoms with you?"
I say, "I'm a player, to be honest with you"
Hublot, woo, so shiny
Mind you, my crew right behind me
Went shopping, could've bought an island
Talking money when I'm with Italians
Spilling purple on the red carpet
And I'm flyer than that nigga on the hang glider
Four, five, six, seven chains on, just stay in your lane, ho
Don't you like these A. Wang's? Don't you like these gold fangs?
You a well-known flexer, I'm a young trendsetter
These hoes, they reckless, they slick, they messy
Three hoes freak dancing, wit' the loud, singing a capella
Chain clang like heavy metal
Sremm killed the haters, God bless them

I step in Def Jam buildin' like I'm the shit
Tell 'em give me fifty million or I'ma quit
Most rappers' taste level ain't at my waist level
Turn up the bass 'til it's up-in-your-face level
Don't do no press but I get the most press kit
Plus, yo, my bitch make your bitch look like Precious
Somethin' 'bout Mary, she gone off that molly
Now the whole party is melted like Dalí
Now everybody is movin' they body

Okay, now ketchup to my campaign, coupe the color of mayonnaise

Spit rounds like the gun range, beat it up like Rampage
Hundred bands, cut your girl, now your girl need a Band-Aid
Grade A, A1, chain the color of Akon
Black diamonds, backpack rhyming, co-signed by Louis Vuitton
Horsepower, horsepower, all this Polo on, I got horsepower
Pound of this cost four thousand, I make it rain, she want more showers

2Pac back, 2Pac back

Stranded on Death Row, Brenda having my baby
But I’m stacking my paper, I need a brand new Mercedes
They screaming 2Pac back, 2Pac back
There’s all these btiches screaming that 2Pac back

[Meek Mill]
Huh, 2Pac back, I’m 2 Glocks strapped
Rolling down in Philly this the new Iraq
Soon as I hit the the hood they screaming who got wacked
It’s a recession on the work, I’m screaming who got crack
I’m sippin Hennessy, riding on my muthafucking enemies
Sliding in the back screamin MMG (Maybach Music)
10 bitches and they dime so it’s Tennessee
Hail Mary, put my wrist on froze
Presidential is gold, nigga play with my money my shooters lifting his soul
40 kick like in soccer, bullets hitting the goal
Bitch I’m like John Wall cause I just give em and go
Plotting on this new 7, I can picture me rolling
Pockets look like they pregnant because them bitches is swollen
Got a clip I can loan, all them snitches could hold em
Look at them muthaf-ckin’ wheels, them bitches is stolen
They screamin’…

[Hook]

[Meek Mill]
Mommy a soldier, daddy is dead
Catch the nigga that did it, and we gon’ carry his head
Fuck 911, tell em have him in?
Talking Death Row records, tell em have me a chair
Let it burn, I’m screaming: "Free my nigga Earl!"
He’s due in, no hestitation we can’t even get a turn
And my Mackaveli CD then I listened than I learned
Grabbed my Mac above the dresser, my OG’s say hold it firm
I’m dreaming spitting with Pac, cyphers with BIG
Try to send me upstate with the license ?
Had me scraping my wax, sleeping, my knife in the bed
They got a nigga on point like there’sa price on my head
I going max, got me knocking suckers and they back
In these cells, raising hell, tryna get back to the trap
But don’t ever get it twisted it’s Meek Mill spittin’ facts
Plus somebody said they seen it
And they mean it so they steady screaming[Verse 1]
Keep it a thousand man
I'll show you what to do with them thousand grams
Scent from the kitchen as loud as a thousand pans
Soda sit the jacket, she smoke the shit out of cans
Saying Young you just might have you a business, you Need A Plan
Gave my lil' nigga some money, "Go buy some pots"
"Take my rental and don't fuck around, the stove is hot"
Nigga why should I be playin' with your hair, the stove or not
Fuck you mean I ain't answerin' my phone? Your numbers blocked
If the folks hit the door right now, my heart would stop
We in this bitch playin' possum right now, me and the blocks
Got a nigga rollin' a spliff right now, he round the block
'Bout to play Bruce Lee on these bitches, karate chop

[Hook]
I hope my hustle don't offend nobody
I can give a fuck what you think about me
You know I like to turn up at the spot
Act a fool with the money
G told me keep it low-key
Now I got the whole house smellin' like smoke
And errythin', coulda smoke a thousand Newports
Really no difference between money and the time
Thin line do it all cause I can't be broke
And nigga there was over right now, you gotta get out here and get it
You a real one you gotta stay strong
Gave my house, my cars, my chain, my fame
Nigga give me my scale and my phone
All I need it 4 zones

[Verse 2]
Them gossipin' and hatin', just a few determination
I go crazy with that money, I'm a fuckin' mental patient
See I started as a youngin', hustlin' for a club fit
Spend your last fifteen hun', you know that club shit
You fall off, you get back, can't give up, that shit whack
I hear links on my cell, I have blow in my nails
I hear hoes in my jeans, I weigh bees on them beans
They had stamps on them things, I broke bread with my team
Got them birdies in the attic, countin' currency in the basement
Aunty said there's somethin' on her silverware cause she can taste it
And I ain't goin' nowhere, you haters gotta face it
And if I lose it all tomorrow nigga, I just need to basics

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
[?] ass hustler, yeah I'm tryna post up
Till I can come through in the lamb, with the doors up
Hit it with that H2O, then it froze up
Back when they was goin' for the two fo', had it sowed up
They pulled me with this nina  in this strap it be a felony
If I get through with this nina on my lap, I'm livin' heavenly
Speed ballin' like this shit a sprint, but this a marathon
Phone ringin' all day and night, like a telethon
If you a real hustler you gon' get that, he ain't get it
If you a real hustler you know how to stay committed
Between me and you got tired of sleepin' with them roaches
And I been havin' flashback, that's why a nigga focus

[Hook][Verse 1]
Let me be your stimulation
I could be your occupation
Work you like a 9 to 5
Plus put in that over time
Careful with what you do to me
Cause everything I do to you
I hope that you'll do for me
And when the light's low
Pop a bottle of that goose please
Twist off a couple loose leaves
(Seduce me)
Girl welcome to my bed
Come here
You thought it would be easy (sy-sy-sy)

[Hook]
(Ow)
Sexy I should get to know
Been thinking lately girl we can get more physical
Won't you call 773, 779 love, oh
Those pantie drawers is all I need
Falling off of your body
Won't you call 773, 779 love, oh

[Verse 2]
Better now and even later
Let me be your innovator
Feels alright when I'm right with you
They lyin' if you not the truth
Miss co-star, let's proceed
You got that fire, that third degree
Yo, this is how's supposed to be
And when the light's low
Pop bottle with a goose please
Twist off a couple loose sleeves
(Seduce me)
And welcome to my bed
Baby won't you come here
Thought it would be easy

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Okay girl I'm not him put it down, down

[Hook][Intro: Future]
Ain't no way around it
Ain't no way around it
Ain't no way around it
Ain't no way around it
Ain't no way around it
Ain't no way around it

[Hook: Future]
A bitch gon' be a bitch
A ho gon' be a ho
A killer gon' be a killer
That's somethin' you need to know
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it
A dealer gon' be a dealer
A plug gon' be a plug
My niggas, them my niggas, they just like blood
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it

[Verse 1: Future]
I had a young, hot thang fucked my bro and gave 'em brain
And she expect for me to love her, I can never be a lame
I'm attracted to her sexually, but she ain't my main dame
We can be the best of friends, shawty, but you off the chain
See I ain't gonna' hold it against ya
I'ma keep it pimpin' with ya
Don't you come at me with issues
Ain't tryna get all in your mixture
I ain't tryna come to get ya
You can meet me somewhere on Peachtree
At the W on the Fourteenth
Ain't tryna fuck no ho tryna know me
And they wanna fuck my woodie, already smashed the homie
Half of these bitches phony, singin' love songs like Toni
Ms. Braxton you the action, stop actin'
Just another sad love song waitin' to happen

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Strapped with that flame and he ready to bust a brain
You can't tell the homie nothing, he done felt too much pain
He don't care nuttin' 'bout no fame
He addicted to the game
Some niggas rob, some niggas slang
Do whatever to maintain
Travel all the way to Waco
Get them numbers for the low-low
Bigger the risk, the bigger the check
We watch for po-po
Make sure you keep your eyes on
When you're drivin' down 1-0
That interstate ain't no joke when you're ridin' with Coco
When you got hands like these
You can count money with your eyes closed
When you spend cheese like this
You send killers to niggas front door
Half of these niggas front fo', bitches for extra convo
Really plugged in with migo, go blind and still get c-notes

[Hook][Intro : Juicy J]
Security fucked up let me bring the zip in
Yo bitch missing we both missing we both disappear
If I pull up in that Phantom she gon' disappear
If I pull up in a Phantom we gon' disappear

[Hook x2: Swae Lee & Slim Jxmmi]
She's drunk already
I'm lit already
What you mean roll up
What you mean burn up

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Let's talk money shit I'm rich already
Let's get freaky baby call me Robert Kelly
I'm at Penthouse watching bitches shake their jelly
Weed and Liquor make her look like Halle Berry
I'm lit don't wear no panties
Let them kids stay with their granny
This dick you about to swallow save that fuck shit for your marriage
Ho I'm Juicy J, to fuck me is a dream
Ziploc full of trees, hypnotize your mind then I leave
Money over hoes by any means, Me
Eight hundred thousand in jewelry I got Egyptian needs
Grab my Phantom keys, pour me a little lean
You niggas out here saving thots I share them with the team
Fuck boy (But anyway...)

[Hook: Swae Lee & Slim Jxmmi](x2)

[Verse 2: Slim Jxmmi]
Already told you niggas that I ain't gon' play
Already told my ho she better stop complaining
Damn that nigga already got that shiny bezel
Told that nigga I'm already on another level
Local thotties at this party already bopping
I just walked in thirty seconds getting topped off
God damn why I keep on shaking niggas hot sauce?
Pull up in that new Camaro I just left that sky loft
I promise I've already sipped
Woah, I told your ho come take a trip
If she bite then I know I’m fucking
If she hop inside the passenger I know I'm busting

[Hook: Swae Lee & Slim Jxmmi](x2)[Intro: Future]
Ay Mike… {Mike Will Made It…}

It's got the other one, but no, it's another one!

[Verse 1 - Slice9]
Alright!
It's S L I C E, pointing over here, I know you see me

East Side I've been there, big chase I've been there

Freebandz!

[Hook]

Yeah baby I'm Levi Leer and now the girls know my name!
Death upon the screen, yeah, all the girls scream
I'll be dressed so fresh and clean in my true religion jeans
And my pockets filled with... but in my pockets I got extra dough
Spend this money.. cause I think these niggas..
I'll be making money, I think I found the receipt
I can see the future like that nigga standing next to me
No one ..what you ask for
..it's another one, give him my number

[Hook][Verse 1- Gucci Mane]
Ballin' in the club cause this is my city
I'm on ciroc, then a boy P-Diddy
Bad little bitch used to talk real slick
Got a real fat ass and her hair so pretty
Ain't even 8, but we drunk already
Ain't even dated, but we fucked already
Got an ounce and a half got it tucked in the stash
Dont come to my pad ,Don't touch my Chevy
Call me a litle player, I'm a rich ass nigga
Do a 13, don't spill my liquor
Girlfriend say that she dig a nigga
Wanna kick with it a nigga like a field goal kicker
Back to the basics, stay smoking grape shit
Code name Gucci, but my real name Radric
Club like the matrix
Hate pussy niggas, but I love big faces
I'm so wasted

[Hook- Gucci]
I don't know what to do with all these big faces
Got a nigga going all these big places
Big face watch with the big bracelet
Gucci, Mike Will, Back 2 Tha Basics
(X2)

[Verse 2- Gucci Mane]
I ain't got time to be fucking with you
I'm losing money fucking with you
I come through in my Bentley coupe
But I forgot to bring the roof
Ain't got time to talk to you
My money do the talking, baby
Drop the top on my Mercedes
My car so sick it went to Grady
Ain't got time to sleep with you
I got some other shit to do
Break off the brick and cook a deuce
I call it chicken noodle soup

[Hook]

[Verse 3- Waka Flocka Flame]
I think it was my white ?, I think it was my white neck
Big faces, dead men
Shawty got the check
4 million up next year, I put that on my set
T-top, two-door, red corvette
I think it was the drink that fucked up the old sets
Pulled in vallet, hopped in VIP
Smoke this kush, dog, like it's legal, T
Me and my bad bitch, just me and my bad bitch
Big dawg with me so you better stay in line
Broke niggas to the left, boy you not my kind
Big faces, big yacht master too
I'm doing big shows, YG in big places

[Hook][Hook]
Shawty cute but she got piercings in her ear face and her tongue
Cashing out them bands that a whole lot of ones
Tattoos on her body says she do that shit for fun
Press a bean on her tongue, she could swallow Vietnam
Put her anywhere she the baddest in the room [x3]
Baddest in the room, baddest in the room

[Verse 1: Slim Dunkin]
Bad bitches put your hands up
If you a badder bitch stand up
Too hot turn the fan up
Make a nigga throw them bands up
Her money talk that's why she don't say much
True religion jeans on her that's why she don't pray much
You can tell from her shoes she ain't ordinary
Girl you be killin' 'em send them to the mortuary
Red bottoms her shoes put her ass in them trues
Hair and nails did too that ice all in them jewels
I love that stank ass walk that's a mean bitch
She got that good brain she on the dean list
Can't feel her legs motivation
I make that ass clap, celebration

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
I got a bad bitch from the PJ's
We make good love fucking to the OJ's
All she wonder where is gucci louis dolce (spoiled) versace menage

Addicted to bad bitches my nigga

Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
All these chicks popping pussies, I’m just popping bandz
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
These chicks clappin’, and they ain’t using hands

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Short hair, like Nia Long, loose ones, she don’t need a loan
Start twerking when she hear her song, stripper pole her income
We get trippy and then some. So nasty when she rollin’
She put that ass up in my hands, I remote control it (Yeah ho)
She give me dome when the roof gone, at the K.O.D. she leave with me
She got friends, bring three. I got drugs, I got drinks
Bend it over, Juicy J gon' poke it like wet paint
You say no to ratchet pussy, Juicy J can't
Racks everywhere, they showin' racks, I'm throwing racks
In the V.I.P, rubber on I’m stretching that
Rich niggas tippin', broke niggas lookin'
And it ain't a strip club if they ain't showin' pussy

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
(... Baby...ha ha ah... Juicy I got ya)
(UGH)
Pop that pussy for a real nigga
Pull out my black card, that's my lil' nigga
Make a movie with your bitch, Steven Spiel nigga
Smoking on Keysh, Cole, gimme me chills nigga
What's your real name? And not your stripper name
I make it rain on ya, like a windowpane
Bandz a make her dance, Tunechi make her cum
Hit-it-from-the-side-like-a-mother-fucking-bass-drum
Two hoes on one fucking pole, two hoes on my fucking pole
I don't tip, I pay bills, bitches call me Buffalo
Her stomach in and her ass out
I'm flyer than the ones they pass out
If money grow on trees, I branched out
I'm just waiting on my bitch to cash out (Ha ha)
(...just waiting for my bitch to cash out
Tunechi... Young Mula Baby)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
(2 Chainz)
2 Chainz, four bracelets
Let me see that ass clap; standing ovation
If yo girl don't swallow kids, man, that ho basic
Got 2 bitches wit me: take a shot of one ho, using her friend for a chaser
Bandz a make her bust it, let me see you touch it
Money talk, you ain't got none, end of discussion
(Bandz a make her do it, pocket full of money
Young nigga gettin' head while the engine runnin'
Let me see you wiggle, do it for a real nigga
I be laughing to the bank, all you do is giggle
Ballin' in my coupe, call it sports car
Drop the top and freak it, treat that bitch just like a porn star

[Hook][Intro: Lil Wayne]
Remix baby!

[Hook: Juicy J] (x2)
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
All these chicks popping pussies, I'm just popping bandz
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
These chicks clappin', and they ain't using hands

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Montana!
Bands a make her dance, 20's make her glance
50's make her flip, 100's make her give me head (head)
Cheeks clappin', she don't use no hands
All this pussy poppin', I'm just poppin' bands
I just pay the mortgage, I just pay the note
Hurricane Katrina, bitch you need a boat
Bitch you need to float, show me what your twerking with
20 bottles, 30 models, 40 burners bitch!

[Verse 2: Lola Monroe]
She like, "What the fuck is a dollar bill?"
Ass pound like Impala wheels
3 wheel motion, grippin grain
Fuck the motion just get the change
I don't know what you thinking man
I take your money and get the brain
Them other bitches ain't build the same
He say, "You can't be real who built your frame?"
Ever seen a stripper go right, left?
Make it really wanna go pipe, that
But you ain't really gonna like, that
She fuck your brain, no mic, check
Money, money, bet you brake it off
You see that ass, you see that cash, bet she take it off like..

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
I brought some bandz so won't you dance?
Do a stack, you on 2 hands
Another stack now that's 2 bandz
Brought a friend now that's 2 fans
Gettin' trippy now that's 2 Xans
Double that now that's 4 bandz
Juicy J, he got more bandz
Trappin' hard like Snowman
Smokin' loud, I know the grow man
Been gettin' money since a young nigga
But they respect me now cause I'm a grown man, ooh
Condo by the ocean, forgot my watch now that's a Rolex
Hit the strip club and spend more bread and spill champagne on her for head
Smokin' and sippin, I'm talkin' that rich shit hopin' that broke niggas listen
Shorty keep poppin' it, strippin, I got to reach into my pockets to keep tippin
Seen her with the team, that's my bandz chick
Got rich off the internet so it's safe to say that's my bandwidth

[Hook]

[Verse 4: B.o.B]
Bandz a make her dance
It'll get her wet, it'll make that ass go ham
It'll get her heels high for the sky
It'll make them 2 lips kiss the floor when she land, damn
That outta do it, if I'm with a bitch then she probably hood
Gin on the rocks, gon' off the kush
She gon' off the bean she in Mollywood
She dance for my bandz like it's homecoming
She ain't working gettin' money, she at home cuming
I stake the facts, I brake her back if I drop a grip like it's snow money
I see broke niggas watching, cause they ain't got no paint
It's a lot of niggas saving hoes but Bobby Ray can't
I say what's going broke, can y'all reminds us?
Lost in the money can't y'all finds us?
Tasha and Nicole sliddin' on a pole
Booty going dumb like Alzheimer
I say what's going broke please y'all remind us?
Self made niggas no co-sign us
Tasha and Nicole sliddin' down a pole
Booty going dumb like Alzheimer

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Juicy J]
Bank tellers, bad bitches, paid niggas, they love me
Stripper hoes, married women, I be whatever the bub be
Met a dancin chick named Porsche, with a stallion ass like a horse
In V.I.P, at KOD, I'm gettin' oral intercourse
Twerking for bandz, I be on xan
She gon' keep popping them racks on your hand
Juicy stay making it rain in the club
And I ain't leaving until that bitch flood
Rolling like it's nothing and I don't give a damn
I would say no to ratchet pussy but I just don't think I can
In the suite with a stripper sipping lean and tweakin'
Poppin' molly and that ass, watch her get freaky
Gotta get some brain man, see what she thinkin'
Shawty don't spit, she like to keep it
White girl on that oxy, I'm on Bombay in that KK
Got major bread like Mitt Romney
Fuck making it rain a tsunami

[Outro]
Bandz a make her danceHit ya ass on the celly, cause I ain't got time
To be arguing with your ass, if you ain't really ready
Girl why you never ready for as long as you took
You better look like Halle Berry...or Beyoncé
Shit then we getting married
I brought sand to the beach cause my beach is better
You can keep ya beach cause that beach whatever
Started out at The Darby, ended up at 1 Oak
Left the house with 100 grand, ended up near broke
Don't get mad at me, I'm buying bucket after bucket
When it's gone I'm like fuck it, I replace it with another one
Can't take this money with you
Burn this shit up like I'm Richard
Niggas asking is the oven on[Intro: Juicy J]

Smoke until I cough, I love to break the law

Uh, eh uh, hi
I don't really know what I'm rapping about
But I'm I'm going and I'm like

Gramps told me not to crash
Told pops to fuck his own ass!



[Chorus: Young Vein & Uncle Bill]

I saw titties on my vacation
Saw my nuts thought they was raisins
Name on Xbox is LeeroyJenkins
I keep stroking to different faces

GREG P*TTS

McDonough's nuts could fill a lobby!
Cory gets hard when he sees Bobby!
He then jacks off at Blu Wasabi!
It's turned into a fucking hobby!
He jacks off at Blu Wasabi!



[Verse 1: Young Vein]

I'm thinking about going in, I'm not really sure
This is my first freestyle ever for the record
So I'm gonna take it off, I might go off I'm not sure
I might just cough too
We're about to see, so uh
Let's take it from here


My nuts are really big
I call them big fig
I'm going in
I just took a shit
My shit looks like pigs
My pigs look like shits
My piggies are purple
And purple is kurple


Purple is kurple and kurple is purple
This is a paradox so call the boondocks
I'm taking my socks and taking them shots
I'm taking them shots and taking them punches
I'm taking them punches so call me Rocky
And if I'm Rocky they're pretty cocky


All this trash I'm about to pass
(?)
I digress, so let's get back to the
Punches

If I'm punching, then, I'm thinking about lunching
If I'm thinking about lunching
I'm thinking about cookies and pies
And since there's no pie there's no crab so...




[Chorus: Young Vein & Uncle Bill]

I saw titties on my vacation
Saw my nuts thought they was raisins
Name on Xbox is LeeroyJenkins
I keep stroking to different faces


McDonough's nuts could fill a lobby!
Cory gets hard when he sees Bobby!
He then jacks off at Blu Wasabi!
It's turned into a fucking hobby!
He jacks off at Blu Wasabi!




[Verse 2: Thor]

Ahah you know what we coming about!
We coming about this bitch now!
Hahoo! Yehuhoo! Yeah! Whoo!
Alright we dropping we dropping


I'm big! I'm strong!
Fucked her in my thong!
Master of the pong
Tom and Jerry give me the bong!


Damn sally scramble
Fucked her like a mammal
Boulder balls, Niagra falls
Elton John ain't got shit on me!




[Verse 3: SNVKE]

Uh

We gon' drop on this shit right now
(?) The squirrels with the boon tits
Don't forget the realest
Fucking, Jud H***rege

A corn cob pipe and a button nose
I'm fucking this bitch with a flock of two hoes
Chris be getting strong with a dildo and a bong
Short shorts, nice clothes, killing bitch (?)
Put things up my ass; Cats, rats and bats
Nuts weigh a ton, veins the size of the gulf
Talking 'bout McDonough cause he's always fucking gone

(?)
(?)
(?)
(?)
(?)
(?)


Like it's coming from the Marriot
(?)
Bend it over slap that ass
Make that bitch sound like the zoo
(?)
(?)

[Verse 4: Uncle Will & Uncle Bill]

Uncle Bill ain't here bitch, he's gone off to 'nam
Every time I've rapped it's been a fucking time-bomb
When I speak it sounds like Kanye went and fucking shat
I'm used to doing freestyles
Welcome to my trap


So Cory!
Please tell me!
Will you suck my iron dick?!
Because I really can promise
That "you're never gonna believe this"!
I took your
Shamoo toy
And fucked it till it popped!
My dick is so hard
It needs to wear a damn sock!


There's a (devil spawn)
That I talked to for
One
Damn
Month!
But she couldn't stay committed
Sucked his dick like a cunt!


But you see, I don't mind
I think it's quite hot
That this girl I now love will gladly take a
Cum-shot


Now that we've settled that
I think it's time to clear the air
Chris I fucked your Aunt Bertha
And she's got some
Wear and tear!


Now back to the main issue
I don't mean to run my mouth
But you see it's so damn easy
When yours is a fucking house

And yes, I mean you (YG Laughing)

I said since you walked into the door, you hit the floor, now that the feelings arrived
Now we feeling the zone, we feeling the vibe, vibe, vibe
