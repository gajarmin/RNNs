[Hook]
This the song I wrote if I died;
I was on the 50 mile doing 9-5
Beating the pussy like it ain't got 9 lives
And I'm high, mix Ciroc and some blunts, ‘cause you only live once
‘Cause you only live once (x3)

[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
White girl wasted, my wife-girl hate it
‘Cause when I’m faded I just wanna
See her naked
Adjust adjacent, like baby let me see your matrix
Kama Sutra, back to basics
Since I was on the go, back to the block
105 on, started bumpin’ Hard Knock
I looked at my nigga Fly, as my heart dropped
Sedan in front swervin’ as the car stopped
In that split second, my foot steppin’ breakin’
I thought to myself, I always knew that I would make it
All it took was patience, and now I’m on the stations
Luckily I made it right before my life was taken
It was too good to be mistaken for happiness and riches
People callin’ my phone, like they happy that we did it
Little did they know I was ‘bout to meet my maker
Till an angel came down and told me that my time was later

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]
Riiiiiight, fuck it
Pass the deuce, 'member creepin’ through the 'jects
Had to, stash the deuce in my 40 ‘Low boots
International, my bread is well earned
L's burn, smash hoes in Melboure
Light skinned jawn, look like Chanel Imon
One night, got her hooked, like I’m heroin
Vintage Vanson's  puffin’ on chron
Posted, lookin’ like a slim or Daron
Give me some to a 112 song
Smoke a nigga like a Newport Long
Pass off to my man, be a baton
‘Cause it ain’t no fun if the homies don’t get none
Right, it's like ballin' on a bitty
Bunch of bad bitches from different cities
Illest niggas in New yitty
Kush God, Joey Bada$$, relax and stack the skrilly, DZA

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Joey Bada$$]
Late night cruisin', fusing the green with the cuban
So swift we moving through clouds intruding
Celestial Nubians, known them since
I was a Brand Nubian and they influenced him
And now it’s new beginnin’s, catch me sinnin’ in Sin City
Sittin’ and spinnin’ and spittin’ in ya city
Swimmin’ in ya bitty, put kin in her kitty and breasts
Got protection in the vest, but still penetrate correct
The vets, I got the remedy for these bitches
Inject, enter sex and eject get some intellect
And jet cuz all we do is flex on the weekends
They upset cause I learned how to flex on the weakest
End of my strength they drenched in they trenches
The fence in my terrace is gold, leave ya defenseless in the cold
And I know all you nigga’s weaknesses
Through my threshold, sight on some instinctive shit

[Hook][Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]

Rolling up a seal, blowin' up but still
Going hard on my job like I ain't sitting on a mill
Now filet mignon come with every meal
I swear to God that I'm so high, feel like I'm going up a hill
Car marijuana coated
Paid 250,000 for it, still hop in that thing, ride like I stole it
I'm talking vacation island resorting
I made eleven million nigga without any endorsements
Took the niggas out I was out on the porch with
To Saint Tropes to race them in Audis and Porsches
Bentleys and rolls, plenty of smoke
Thousands for weed, Fendi's for clothes
I remember I couldn't get shit back then when I was broke
Now that I'm rich, everything's for the low
So I could give a fuck 'bout what they saying
Cause they wasn't with me way back when a nigga was just

[Hook x2]

Macking, Hanging
Rowland, Getting that paper

[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]

Riiiiightt
We living life shit, the bud is never ending
Kush God Bob Marley on my pendant
You know that lo is the life that I'm living
Ralph Lauren always keep a nigga spending, word
I can't lie, it's the truth, a stack for these joints
Five-hundred a boot, double R L I don't do Trues
That ain't for me
Getting money killing shows in the home of the maple leaf
These rap niggas live in a land of make believe
Jimmity Cricket ass niggas and cool enough to fool with us
Nah, cool table geeks play the back, haters play the side door
Jet life, taylor gang what you ride for
We keeping the ends, competition is slim
In case you looking for them niggas, have no fear, we are them
Corner the market, getting money, Rolling Stoned
Young Khalifa, rugby rohdes, riight

[Hook x2][Intro: A$AP Rocky]
Coming down, sittin' clean, mixin' that Promethazine

These real slugs, y'all 8-track
That's fool's gold, I’m two, four

Loaded up on ammo
Dumping all these features
Fucking with me? Nah, my man

Ain't no system, try my man
Then they wonder why, my man
Moving like we moving, rising like we rising
ASAP Worldwide, global enterprising (huh)
Don’t that sound good, corporate but I'm wild hood
Coming from a wild hood now just his style (Huh)
Ricky always with us, sip the 'zona
Flacko put me on it, now the hoes won't get up off it
That's that pimp shit, never on no symp' shit
Shorty here now, best believe that's my tense bitch

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
I'm a weirdo
Molly in the pocket of my pea coat
Wresting a P-bo have three hoes
Got coke so we about to speed boat

Step brother shit got boats and hoes
Boats and soda, rolling up the doja
White boys grew up the Pacific Coast
I thought I told ya so, I got tons of hoes
So when I lick lick lick lick on that bitch friend
Take the dick out the pussy, put it in the throat
Jiggas can’t say no to James
I done popped about 2 beans
Spillin' purple on the Moncler
Splitting swishers, blunts in the air
With my nigga, Smoke DZA
Now these hoes wanna know a nigga
Cause when I'm on the east, I fuck with Ruff
On the west, my drink is gruff
Fuck my dog, fuck my peso
Suck my dick ho cause I say so
Now she all up on my jock
Never made love but I fuck a lot
Taking shots of that tiger balm
Jeremy Scott, tiger on
Fixing a blunt at the blunt fitting dope
Now she talking about she wants the tiger balm
And my teeth fucked up but nigga I got hella hot hoes
I'm that Detroit mothafucker with the rudest flow

[Hook: A$AP Rocky & (Smoke DZA)]
I'm sittin' high, I'm tippin' slow
I'm gettin' high, but I'm sippin' slow
Mouth full of golds, nigga I got hella hoes

Coming down, sittin' clean, mixin' that Promethazine (Uh)
Coming down, sittin' clean, mixin' that Promethazine (Uh)

Coming down, sittin' clean, mixin' that Promethazine
(White! Purple, we loco! Purple, we loco!
On purple, we loco! Purple, we loco!)

[Verse 3: Killa Kyleon]
I’m too throwed
Two white cups, my shit filled
Drunk, high, pop Vic or X
Drink got me on lean like my 5th wheel
Candy painted sitting on them pokers
Make a barber disappear like hocus pocus
David Blaine, I take your picture
And never eat no dick like fried okra
ASAP my jewelry rocking
My watch, my chain, last name’s Stallone
King of the underground like Kevin Bun
Y’all freshman niggas better watch the throne
Money calling, gotta watch the phone
A nigga on his grind can’t miss shit
I’m bad to the bone like hoes clothes
AKA I’m a misfit
Y’all broke ass niggas just get rich
While I get rich my flow loco
It's so loco
I got the game in the jump, seen the show coat, del loco
Stupid bread, retarded money
As that Chevy my short bus
Smoking loud, you gotta cough it up
Another beat dead, getting chopped up
Part fidel, screwed face
I’m so H-Town like Scoob‘s tapes
Counting money, y’all flick the conch
I’ll hold a dead nigga so two faced (yeah)
Kush garden
There’s a killa, I lean and dream
My cups double, my blunts rolled
And I'm shaking these haters like Hakeem the Dream

[Verse 4: Freeway]
That shit crazy I’ve been lock
Since niggas been living in they moms’ house
Had ye, had nicks, had dimes out
While y’all was still playing in your snow clothes
Yo new chick? My old ho
Yo new style? My old clothes
These niggas ain't got no clothes
Plus they be kicking it with po-po
I’m realer toward the dealer
Need that pen of Mary Urkle
Got a real line, got a trap line
Got Google voice numbers on both phones
I’m a globe trotting nigga that hold chrome
Fireman gotta ladder that chromo
No sprite, sip the purple straight
R-A-N-A real ass niggas that don’t blow
Mommy give me chocha
Papi know I’m loco
I see him, and cop two
Then he throw me popas
Betty Crocker cakes I move
A lotta come in place your order
Move that king, simply cause we able to
And proper told the chopper (haha)

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Smoke DZA]
Why? I’m a loco, nigga straight loco
First time out I warned y'all
Now I’m bout to go postal
First let me get to the pro tools
Fucking real low nigga, old school
This time I brought my folks through
Harlem niggas show love like I’m supposed to (huh?)
I got some bud in the cut
Rolling through the sink with some mud in my cup
Pour me an eighth, got me all stuffed
My nigga low from Meridian know what’s up
One time for my N.O. niggas
My Texas niggas, some reckless niggas
Double cup for breakfast niggas
All day no, effort niggas
I'm gettin' high, I'm sippin' slow
And all this tour money, I'mma get some more
Aight, bring it to the hood, get a heavy flow
You know us Harlem mothafuckas like to hustle though
I need the bread and the butter
Might be a hit, wouldn’t it be nice if I fooled ya
One time for the third and my homeboy Scudda
Better watch yo mouth til I get this shooter
I'm a loco, loco, you shook nigga
Keep yo head down, don’t look nigga
Better watch out for the hook

[Outro: A$AP Rocky]
Coming down, sittin' clean, mixin' that Promethazine[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Gold teeth and a snapback
Camo shorts, high socks and hoodies
Animal print Joyrich backpack
Keep a Raw cone stuffed with goodie
Eyes low as hell, I rock old Chanel
Smell the kush smoke on my mink
Jacuzzi bubbles on my Cuban link
Sipping champagne, smoking marijuana
Every finger got a ring
You can tell just by our slang
Native print and skinny pants, young Americana
Two Cs on my frame, eating pasta with my team

[Hook x8: Wiz Khalifa]
I rock old Chanel, old Chanel

(Pull up in a Porsche
Beverly Hills, smoking that weed)

[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]
I do 'Lo as well
With all this double RL and Rugby, ain’t hard to tell
Polo Sport, nigga I'm on the field (coasting)
No Karo, we cracked the seal
Gotta make sure the act is real
Don't fingerfuck the bud, the pack is real
Fans hyped cause they lit us up
I'm high, don't really give a fuck
I Usain Bolt through Denim & Supply
I'm seasons ahead, you couldn't catch me if you tried
I run my lane so hard, my feet swell up
Continuous waves, word to my sea dweller
'Lo bears, I got so many
Foamposites like I know Penny
Bombay, no Henny
Keep nelly in that old Chanelly
Keep her earrings flooded and her wrists heavy
So when them bitches come through with them fake Speedy she laughin'
RLX'd up, like I came from the Aspens
DZA

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
That new BBC Barney's collab came out
I ordered me one, lit one up and got happy as fuck
Shout out to the niggas swagging me up
Cause now you think I get this shit off the back of a truck
I got so much of it
Flaunting pieces - one of a kind custom shit
Going on trips, I hope my luggage fit
You only rock it cause it got two Gs on it
My wife bag cost 6 G’s and got them two C’s on it
Plus, I'm smoking well
My outfit dope as hell
Trying to find out what I'm rocking to the Grammy's
Put that iPhone down fool, don't try to Instagram me
That's ho shit

[Hook: Wiz Khalfa][Intro:]
F-f-f-for the underground

[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
What you looking at?
I'm with the Crooklyn pack
Don't front, we brought Brooklyn back
You know where my lines is, where the hookers at
One punchline outshine 'em 'fore I show 'em where the hook is at
Where you at?
Pro Era info, you could book us at
We snot-noses don't forget
Where the boogers at
Brown skin, curly hair, tell 'em J Boog is back
I be too brick
Insane in the membrane from the empire
But I keep my mind in the pen state
Niggas wanna know how I keep my pen straight?
Damn straight
How they trying to bite off of my template
Based off they sentences
That ain't got good Penmanship
That get you clapped like an assembly
And that's all that I was sent to say
Let's get a offer 'fore SOPA try to censor me
They provoked an immenser, intenser me
Niggas thought they could relax but look tense to me
That's all that I was sent to say
Let's get a offer 'fore SOPA try to censor me
They provoked an immenser, intenser me
Niggas thought they could relax but look tense to me

[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]
I walk around Harlem blocks, pockets full of knots
Niggas try to jock cause I smoke the best pot
Road trips, I let my young chick rock
Hold the work for a nigga slide at the rest stop
Hungry like a nigga fresh out
Sippin' medicated punch, somewhere decked out
Scribble my name, "X" your name out
Fuck off me, turpentine to get the stain out
Nigga my name ring bells from Wellington to Belgium
You get your passport stamped seldom
Fuck around, kids you're welcome
Washed 'em up before the bell rung
Fuck your premonitions, my proposition to the opposition
Is get down and lay down or pop up missin'
George Kush, when it's war, I'm firin'
Money on your head, nigga, change your mind

[Verse 3: Big K.R.I.T]
Hey, let me ride, woah
Let me rap a taste
We cut them corners like stoners 'til they evaporate
I had to break, no longer dancing by the rhythm of
Plunder searching of suckers smoke fuck it, I had to kill them, you know
Niggas ain't fuckin' with Cinematic
Half of these niggas ain't even average
How is it the word classic gets tossed around
But fuck them critics, I do this shit here for the underground
Bubble hotter than molten lava that burn their summer down
Itty bitty tittie sucker, where them hoes you claim you fucking
All up on my jock again, I get around like Pac and 'em
Slamming sushi roll ties with teriyaki paint
I chop stick her dim sum enter the dragon
Sho 'nough, locusts, the grasshoppers is plenty
They peep my technique, but can never ever beat the sensei
Shogun, try me nigga, I know some, word to Sant
I crush their vertebraes, my verbal plate can weigh a ton
Elephant been in the room
They can't decipher for the life of many biters that challenge us, how we still consume
Cyphers of so many writers unlike us are surely doomed
A king remembered in time, I thought you knew

Got me talking reckless all night with it

Real life, he ain't even like niggas
Tryna be more like Bob Lemon
Obsession with the flow let the beat ride
From the West to the East side
Light the sour and bump this joint up in your G ride

[Hook: ASAP Rocky]
Uh, I'm sittin' high, I'm tippin' slow

(Purple, we loco! Purple, we loco!
On purple, we loco! Purple, we loco!)

[Verse 2]

Been around the globe, you're a local

You niggas hard of hearin', thought I told you
There's some new niggas eating in the hood
Shit. them other niggas old news
We them new niggas
Clappin at strong, whole crew's stable
Me and my niggas run this shit
Coolest niggas sittin' at the cool table
Niggas pop shit on the web
Hide up in they crib cause they ain't able
'til you GPS a nigga's crib, tell some niggas where they live
Like they worked for cable, but they bout that life
You niggas ain’t with it though
You know, who you fooling?
You know you don’t smoke for real
Why you tryna reach for the doob? What you doing?
'til the next life
It's Jet Life, flying high is luxury
Ain’t shit changed, still George Kush
Still need eight lungs to come puff with me

[Hook][Hook: Ab-Soul]

Every line is bullet nigga I hope you got your vest
Mad? Niggas stay mad at me haters in form of flattery
Fuck nigga give Liu Kang fatalities
I ain't never worry, a real nigga ain't gotta say he a real nigga
Cuz, niggas know already
Talk grease but I'm your favorite ar-tist
Every verse is funeral i'm a walking Ortiz
Kush God speed, your chick fuck with them gangsters she raunchy
That's on me
You cuff em up cause she a bad girl
Pop off with a nigga she a fast fuck
Threw the cake in my face

Then I be Casper after a blow job and a back rub
DZA

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Look
What the fuck you gon' say about me?
Can you tell em I'm the same OG?
I smoke weed, get high, keep it locked I stay low key
Why don't you mind your fuckin' business
Respect the HNIC
Replace the N and C with two eyes and you'll see me
Throwin' up the fuckin three
Three letters, TDE
And that's for eternity
Kush God and the God MC
Once again, but it's more to see
You might have been to sea world
But have you really seen the world
Do you ask yourself these type of things
Solar system don't go against him
There is no one else alike
Used to have them pipe dreams
Now bitches dream about my pipe
But now we onto bigger things
Reaching peaks and different heights
Women that do different things, still got lean all in my sprite
Fuck life I'm going all out
It's your broad's house, and my balls out
I got demons in my life, I need Jesus in my life
But I ain't sipping wine, I'll be fine Popping Champagne
And we'll bring pain to your camp
If you don't join the campaign

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Smoke DZA]
Another vehicular homicide, Chris Dorner sniper lies
Sandy Hook, Columbine, minus the crisis actors
You niggas born slackers, your voice don't even matter
So mute the chatter, fuckin rappers
This that flow they mic jack, 'This Is It' nigga
Don't watch me, watch my neck and how my wrist lit up
I came back from mines on you jabronis, i don't mingle with you phonies
Bitch I'm K.O.N.Y, Alcatraz on the track
Attack like a savage cat
Undertaker, this the casket match
Pallbearer bring the urn out
They won't win til we quit, we don't burn out

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
Welcome to where the players feast
Some will pay to see, never go but pray to be
Exit row on the low, bargaining the chains they seek
Complaining to me about the needs, that they been on for weeks
Is you sucking or you fucking well, cause this ain't just a glass house
30,000 feet in the air, I'd hate to kick yo ass out
Fly until we pass out, something you should savor
Because if we ain't the best then it's clear that we the greatest
Welcome to-

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]
Dazzled by the JETS
Rozay by the case, why don't you pour a glass?
Access ain't for everybody, let me see your boarding pass
Your amongst kings, fly as fly talk, honor class
Shorty wanna chill, her man just tripping for an autograph
Fuck her with this leg room, middle seat is for the suckers
Turbulence up in they flow, hakey as a motherfucker
On this private jet, while y'all stuck on that commercial flight
Nonstop to the top, enjoying life

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Sant]
Mile high, now just remember I'm the president

Gone and upgrade at the last minute, no way you sitting next to me
You in row "H" ho, you know sitting behind the "G's"
Im such a sight to see so close your eyes
A pimp's wingspan implies that I was going to fly
Get ya mind right bitch you fucking with a star
This ain't the captain speaking but she listen when I call

[Bridge: Big KRIT]
Hurry up, please don't miss your flight
We'll touch down and take off the same night
Just you and me, overseas
We can solve the world with a sight to see
In first class

Only thing that can fix it is a bad bitch with a mouth I can fuck on

Loaded up on ammo
Dumping all these features
Fucking with me? Nah, my man
It’s clear to see you high my man
Ain't no system, try my man
Then they wonder why, my man
Moving like we moving, rising like we rising
ASAP Worldwide, global enterprising (huh)
Don’t that sound good, corporate but I'm wild hood
Coming from a wild hood now just his style (Huh)
Ricky always with us, sip the 'zona
Flacko put me on it, now the hoes won't get up off it
That's that pimp shit, never on no symp' shit
Shorty here now, best believe that's my tense bitch

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
I'm a weirdo
Molly in the pocket of my pea coat
Wresting a P-bo have three hoes
Got coke so we about to speed boat
I got trees anD O's
Step brother shit got boats and hoes
Boats and soda, rolling up the doja
White boys grew up the Pacific Coast
I thought I told ya so, I got tons of hoes
So when I lick lick lick lick on that bitch friend
Take the dick out the pussy, put it in the throat
Jiggas can’t say no to James
I done popped about 2 beans
Spillin' purple on the Moncler
Splitting swishers, blunts in the air
With my nigga, Smoke DZA
Now these hoes wanna know a nigga
Cause when I'm on the east, I fuck with Ruff
On the west, my drink is gruff
Fuck my dog, fuck my peso
Suck my dick ho cause I say so
Now she all up on my jock
Never made love but I fuck a lot
Taking shots of that tiger balm
Jeremy Scott, tiger on
Fixing a blunt at the blunt fitting dope
Now she talking about she wants the tiger balm
And my teeth fucked up but nigga I got hella hot hoes
I'm that Detroit mothafucker with the rudest flow

[Hook: A$AP Rocky & (Smoke DZA)]
I'm sittin' high, I'm tippin' slow
I'm gettin' high, but I'm sippin' slow
Mouth full of golds, nigga I got hella hoes
I'm that Harlem mothafucka with that mellow flow
Coming down, sittin' clean, mixin' that Promethazine (Uh)
Coming down, sittin' clean, mixin' that Promethazine (Uh)
Coming down, sittin' clean, mixin' that Promethazine (Uh)
Coming down, sittin' clean, mixin' that Promethazine
(White! Purple, we loco! Purple, we loco!
On purple, we loco! Purple, we loco!)

[Verse 3: Killa Kyleon]
I’m too throwed
Two white cups, my shit filled
Drunk, high, pop Vic or X
Drink got me on lean like my 5th wheel
Candy painted sitting on them pokers
Make a barber disappear like hocus pocus
David Blaine, I take your picture
And never eat no dick like fried okra
ASAP my jewelry rocking
My watch, my chain, last name’s Stallone
King of the underground like Kevin Bun
Y’all freshman niggas better watch the throne
Money calling, gotta watch the phone
A nigga on his grind can’t miss shit
I’m bad to the bone like hoes clothes
AKA I’m a misfit
Y’all broke ass niggas just get rich
While I get rich my flow loco
It's so loco
I got the game in the jump, seen the show coat, del loco
Stupid bread, retarded money
As that Chevy my short bus
Smoking loud, you gotta cough it up
Another beat dead, getting chopped up
Part fidel, screwed face
I’m so H-Town like Scoob‘s tapes
Counting money, y’all flick the conch
I’ll hold a dead nigga so two faced (yeah)
Kush garden
There’s a killa, I lean and dream
My cups double, my blunts rolled
And I'm shaking these haters like Hakeem the Dream

[Verse 4: Freeway]
That shit crazy I’ve been lock
Since niggas been living in they moms’ house
Had ye, had nicks, had dimes out
While y’all was still playing in your snow clothes
Yo new chick? My old ho
Yo new style? My old clothes
These niggas ain't got no clothes
Plus they be kicking it with po-po
I’m realer toward the dealer
Need that pen of Mary Urkle
Got a real line, got a trap line
Got Google voice numbers on both phones
I’m a globe trotting nigga that hold chrome
Fireman gotta ladder that chromo
No sprite, sip the purple straight
R-A-N-A real ass niggas that don’t blow
Mommy give me chocha
Papi know I’m loco
I see him, and cop two
Then he throw me popas
Betty Crocker cakes I move
A lotta come in place your order
Move that king, simply cause we able to
And proper told the chopper (haha)

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Smoke DZA]
Why? I’m a loco, nigga straight loco
First time out I warned y'all
Now I’m bout to go postal
First let me get to the pro tools
Fucking real low nigga, old school
This time I brought my folks through
Harlem niggas show love like I’m supposed to (huh?)
I got some bud in the cut
Rolling through the sink with some mud in my cup
Pour me an eighth, got me all stuffed
My nigga low from Meridian know what’s up
One time for my N.O. niggas
My Texas niggas, some reckless niggas
Double cup for breakfast niggas
All day no, effort niggas
I'm gettin' high, I'm sippin' slow
And all this tour money, I'mma get some more
Aight, bring it to the hood, get a heavy flow
You know us Harlem mothafuckas like to hustle though
I need the bread and the butter
Might be a hit, wouldn’t it be nice if I fooled ya
One time for the third and my homeboy Scudda
Better watch yo mouth til I get this shooter
I'm a loco, loco, you shook nigga
Keep yo head down, don’t look nigga
Better watch out for the hook

[Outro: A$AP Rocky]
Coming down, sittin' clean, mixin' that Promethazine[Intro: Smoke DZA]

Kush God Bitch!
I'mma need a ten piece from Harold's mild sauce
Make sure the fries is crispy and all that
Locate the uber take 'em to CBS
Make sure you get me all the dutches in that motherfucker
Smokin' this whole pack whatever I don't smoke I'm taking home
I play like that
RIGHT!

[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
Fuck the hold up what's the hold up keep it capital G
Blow a donut nigga roll up when you listen to me
It's the god nigga, kushed god see me strutting through the fog nigga
All hail, shit my cartel full of kings
Made men pulling strings
Sons of anarchy kind of things
Stoner spirituals, hustler hymns
Sermons'll have you burning stuff some wax in your pen
I'm el plaga I say it once and I don't say it again
Fuck what you saying you ain't playing unless you playing to win
Unanounced walk in your house, light up in your living room
Ash on your couch, take your lighter and bounce
Nigga rolled in, rolled out, blowing lethal
My cologne is tuscan leather and sour diesel
Classic, classic apple like [?]
I'm the best nigga here in all honesty
In all honesty fuck the politics save the politics for politicians [?]
Ain't no denying it's great, been a loser all your life take this L to the face


[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]
I put me on
Go ahead play yourself like Leon
Get the tables Devaughn
It's the Kushed God reborn
Resurrected on a 8th blue bud the whole day created clouds
There will never be a drought
Not in my world so much stake might have gout
And I'm a [?] like fuck the [?] I don't know if that's chicken
Betting against DZA I don't know what they thinking
Fuck what it seems get out of my jeans,off my dick
Visit Supreme they buckets is mean cop all 'em
Blow herb on stage, then get payed
Young OG, son niggas twice my age
Front on me, don't do it
Rip you apart make you look so stupid
Cigars in the freezer
Strawberitas for the thots trying to glow
Fucking peons throwing rocks at the throne[Hook]
Good weed, fine women, fast cars, new clothes, and I'm ready to go
The further we get the bigger the check new cities more people to know
I'm feelin' real good, so great, amazin', but that's how it's always been
I'm feelin' real good, so great, amazin', but that's how it's always been

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Yeah a little bit of Kush, break it down, sprinkle it in the joint shit
The type of stoner who be late for his appointments
Fresh white Crest shit, good
Festive, infest the internet, now my shit congested
Got stupid flow, musically amazin'
Let it out like water, so I'm fluid with the cadence
New York, drove up, flew up took a train then
Hit smoke, when I got here we blazin'
Smoke weed and maintain
And Most Dope with me at any of my engagements
Bunch of fine bitches, line em' up and arrange em'
Black, white, Asian, got a whole compilation
They say I'm talkin' crazy, but I'm young and I don't give a fuck
You wanna hate me, but I'm dope so now you're givin' up
Give me your money and I'll dibby it up
Make sure my homeys got some liquor they can drink in their cups

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]
I'm in the, wind, plus I'm cool like a Cali night
Might shoot through a few zips, but that's somethin' light
You know I charged through it
Soaring over the clouds, might fall through it
You can't take me out this sour state of mind I'm in
Plus Mac hit me so it's marathon time again
How far is the high life and the finer things
We worldwide they doing minor things
If you ain't flying high then you might as well hate
36 thousand feet in the air I'm feeling great
And I ain't never coming down
You need your pilot license with you whenever I come around
The dispensary I done ran through there
It-it's heroina and it's bamboo here
Courtesy of my homey Brock
Smoker's club baby, we got it all in stock

[Hook][Hook]
All my cars got gas in the ashtray
And all my cars got gas in the ashtray
All my cars got gas in the ashtray
And all my cars got gas in the ashtray

And we roll up that dour

[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
Riiiiiight!
Blowing on that loud in the gas mask
Always get bomb, nigga: Baghdad
Hit the green door, get a grab bag
Pull out my trippy slide, Nicki with her fast ass
If I cop 5 I get em 4 a piece (riiight?)
Load up Dreddy van, hit the L.I.E
Niggas rapping, they be trappin, that's a L-I-E
I really live that let me tell you who the hell I be!
Had a nigga in the spot in the Hamptons, used to grab 4 of em
That's 25 a piece at least
Nigga getting chicken off that liquid petroleum
That OG kush, I used to ounce that
Fucked a little money up, it help me bounce back
I know it sounds absurd, nigga, living off herb
But e'rybody in the world need that loud pack
Riiiight?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Domo Genesis]
Bitch-ass niggas wanna sleep on me?
Now I'm a nightmare
Wait that's the spot where they wrote me off
Y'all bitch-ass niggas still right there!
Nigga I don't even fight fair
I know it might scare, don't give a slight care
I ignite yea bitch I'm so high, nigga I can fly Dom Buzz Lightyear
Had a nice year and the bitch just started
OF Tape went fucking retarded
I been that nigga, why you fuck boys stalling
I was Doms OG, puffing and coughing
Man niggas ain't real this often
But I'mma be that til they put me in a coffin
I'mmma be crack so inhale me with caution
Nigga, it be green like a jersey in Boston
It's Doms nigga, you better get real fine nigga
We in the middle of the calm nigga
And you know we drop bombs nigga
It's Smoke DZA and Harry Fraud, nigga
That's the cue for applause nigga
I had my back against the wall, nigga
Said fuck that and I balled, nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Schoolboy Q]
Backwoods keep a nigga's mind stuck
Off OG niggas tryna OD
With a NY bitch who want a mouth rush
She let a nigga skeet, all the girls know me
And I got the head too, cause the weed's so good, made a bitch say "Q!"
And a nigga so faded, racked out man a nigga straight made it
And you won't hit it if you're corny
Just got a ounce, more dope for the homies
I'm a rap Willie Nelson and Monster Kody
These raps is the end
I don't fuck with Kony, sliding in a Benz, no top up on me
50 for the bill, nigga fuck that Tony
Ride around gettin it, smoking on doty
(Fire pack)
My mama with a bag with a little bit of hash
My daughter hear my grind and she had covered it with cash
Brought behind the wheel on me and gas
My nigga was in my drawers, so she smothered me with ass
Girlfriend are bugging, happy cause they keep me hoes
Switching up my flows cause a nigga getting blow
Dollar after dollar, man, this money getting old
Still buying eighths, what you know about O's?

[Hook][Intro, DZA, ad-libbing:]
DZA...Twelvyy...cool shit
*La musica de Harry Fraud.*
Riiiighht...

[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
Colder than a motherfucker; dead body flow
I be so, good on the bullshit, adios. The maricons
Is not in my league, no exceptions though
I'm Eskimo, on this medicinal
They killing theyselves with that ore-ga-no!
That kind a' bud, that's the shit I don't light;
Try to be kind and pass it off to me, I stomp it out on sight
What the lick read? Tribal shit, Indian head on my Rugby,
Nigga it's the big chief, fly as shit, just enjoy this shit
Until I'm six feet, high as shit — I live on cloud nine;
And every time you see me know my outfit's Columbine: killa
Niggas talkin' 'bout fly shit, but them so-called fly niggas jack my shit
Talk about me so much your ho jumped on my dick!

[Hook:]
You sense my cool, you see my jewels, you see they're *better*
You know my style got you like wow, you know it's *better*
Nothing like them other niggas, cause we're *better*
It ain't hardly competition

[Twelvyy, ad-libbing:]
Yeah man
We on some wild lucky an' shit, just pass me them..
I ain't giving a fuck. Yo! Yo!...

[Verse 2: ASAP Twelvyy]
I was smoking outside — almost caught a ticket
Feds taking pictures, middle fingers I be flipping
Balling like I'm Pippen, cross the border
I be dipping through the water like I'm fishing
I done caught her if she missing
They caught a nigga pissing off of offices so listen
I be offin' shit 'n dissing, I don't care for competition
I be soaring, they be blazing, couple of foreign bitches naked
Lay 'em down, let me plank 'em, drop 'em off — you can save 'em
You can never try to play me, I, feed ya bitch my babies
I ain't got it all I'm crazy, I'm a product of the 80's,
I remind 'em of the 80's, cuz I'm charming and I'm wavy
See my shades say Versace, 'n all the sweats are by the Maison.

[Hook, x2:]
You sense my cool, you see my jewels, you see they're *better*
You know my style got you like wow, you know it's *better*
Nothing like them other niggas, cause we're *better*
It ain't hardly competitionJetlife

All aboard!
"La musica de Harry Fraud"
Riiiight!

[Verse 1: Smoke Dza]
Cold as North Dakota, kush is that aroma
Brand new piece from Ralphie's, courtesy of Fola
Always gotta flow of bad bitches on my cobra
In love with the vagina, but not with the beholder
Faded off the Gin until we meet again
Cause just like sanitation
I be out like 3 AM
She always wanna chill cause her man is in the pen
I'm with my nigga Richie, make sure you bring a friend
We like em light-skinned, type: slim, long hair
And freak joints, enticing
We don't wife em, no time to enlighten
We just pipe em, slide like M. Bison

[Hook]
I say it's like that! I'm just leasing the girl
You can have your wife back
She's G'd up, she don't like rap
She just want a real nigga that will pipe that
Baleedat! Baleedat! Baleedat!
She hit a nigga daily cause I'm filling that void
She say she need that, baleedat! baleedat!

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Fast life, slow flow, same old shittin new clothes
We tryna put them papers on your bitch
Say it ain't so, Fool, who you come up with?
Couldn't have been the OG's who raised me
Slidin' through the city checkin' my traps that gold D
Cadillac Mac Alonte, droptop fishbowlin' them haters
See what I got, your bitch in the passenger
Passin' the anthrax, wrappin' the Raw
Over to the Jet Life, a collector of them classic cars
Smoke thicker than peanut butter, me and this bitch
Don't even see each other, when we be together
But she feel me and I feel her ass, softer than a motherfucker
She cook good and get way high, I understand why you love her

Jetlife

Hook[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
Right
Child of the ghetto, nobody explained to me
I learned from the streets no picture was painted for me
This niggas is frauds not what they claiming to be
Got my 9 11 niggas with me, they craving for beef
Let the chopper sing to them like Frankie Sinatra
High-school nigga, probably got shoved in a locker
This for my niggas up top getting ready for lock up
These rap niggas weak, x em out like a pop up
Known for making movies, give them an Oscar
Fucking Lo junkie, part reason why they stock up
Whole hood through the show, spending cake to watch us
Come home to you Kush God on the knockers
Ah, you fucking right
Just another day another hard laying night
These fucking weirdos, these niggas ain't bright
Playing around with DZA ball game, riiiiight

[Hook: Smoke DZA]
I'm on my way, real on cake
Won't stop grinding till my crew all straight
I do my dude don't make me loose my cool
Knock them out the park
What you wanna do niggas, it's ball game
That's a ball game chump, ah
Ball game, nigga, the ball game's done, riiiiight

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
In every inning sure your career's ending
You niggas ain't winning, really you're short winded
The bases is loaded you ever notice
Your spot in your game was took, as I look at your team choking
Sore losers never can play us, a chin bruiser
Send shooters on your block scurting off on a scooter
I'm raising my stock with every hit record, look at my record
Your status will drop soon as they message me in the session
Minor league coaches we feed them bitches to vultures
You posing as a poser, we post your death on a poster
Your highlight is getting closer, to stardom we never start em
We starve em and tire mark em, in the dust so you can watch em
In God trust, I'm probably tied up with a cheerleader
Just your luck you fucked around and let a queer lead ya
Time's up, you play softer than Damien
We aim it at your cranium and leave fragments over the stadium

[Hook: Smoke DZA][Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
Nigga, I'm high off living, do what you do
Live how you live, hold your opinion
Probably cough into a coma if you hit that bowl
God bless the man if he just that bold
You don't do it like we do, nah, we don't believe you
You niggas on that K2, we smoking sour diesel
Kushed God, bitch, nigga chief like Katonah
Flow bonkers, been fly since Tonka
Contraband left on my dresser
Bagged up, got extras, more bread to get up
I hustle, I ain't letting up
These wild niggas sleep, money still printing up
So I be Zombie status
With my Zombie niggas, getting all this cabbage
Kushed God in the physical, Smokers Club original
Members are minimal

[Verse 2: Zombie Juice]
Don't give me no bammer weed
We don't smoke that shit in the N.Y.C
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, feeling vibrant
Close your eyelids, the glorious dead arrive with
DZA, we stay high, stoned, and stay fly
Three grams for breakfast, hash wax for seconds
My reflection, the force to be reckoned, but my direction
These niggas awkwardly threaten, don't need a weapon, this menace
Spark that leaf [?] with a ounce of top shelf chilling, top peeling
All about that green, nigga, can you hear me?
Same nigga on the block, serving grams, getting knots
Wha-what? What you thought, you was smoking that good?
I got a sack of dour and that wax is hitting proper
Dusty Rhodes, elbows dropper, only smoke them if they proper
The dondada, pussy popper, show stopper
Z-O-M-B bitch

[Hook x2: Zombie Juice and Smoke DZA]
Don't give me no bammer weed
We don't smoke that shit in the N.Y.C
We them top notch marijuan coppers
O.G. a dour, make sure it's proper

[Verse 3: Erick Arc Elliott]
Not swagger, but effervescence, some say that sex is a weapon
Keep shorty around like she pregnant
Since I have no filter on the blunts, I have no filter on my mouth
Fuck the living, we are dead, I smoke the marley like the dreads
Rude boy, choose I, lick a shot, choose I
I am on that new high, I'm just trying to boost mine
Spanish mamis say my eyes rojo, don't call po-po
I'm rolling solo, dank, buddha, ain't a thing to you
Eyes closed, Bush, got me singing songs to you
So what's wrong with you, not getting along with you
We should live it a little, smoke trees, fuck all my enemies
Since all my niggas are smoking good, my bitch turned Hollywood
My niggas are riding good, take a pull of the chronic cough
Making you lose your composure so you could hardly talk
DZA got 'em, spark the lighter up
Not dividing us, nigga, you ain't as high as us

[Hook x2: Zombie Juice and Smoke DZA][Intro]
Kushgod bitch, Kony
Wallace what's good
One time for my bro DJ Wally Sparks, one time
Before I get into this shout out to all my gods in New York
That Sandy thing.... lost power, can't find gas.... shit real out here
I feel your pain I went through it too
Riiiiiiiight

[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
I'mma king, I'mma God, I'm your fucking idol
Above man, nigga Satan is my only rival
That's my word, you can quote it like it's from The Bible
It's my time, my turn in the cycle
They took the safe route, I took the cake route
Stu flow, Philippe Chow wanna take out
Kushgod, one and only King of New York just call me Kony
Laying the smack down on you jabronies
Stay to myself everybody's phoney
Get some paper, niggas faces be like Mike Brown when they call fouls on Kobe
I said Kony, niggas said nothing
Purple label cashmere with the grey buttons
Hurricanes in my city that shit is mad wack
No gas, closest thing to 93 is Joey Badass
I'm bad ass, a man made natural disaster
Till my jersey hang in the rafters, I'm in the hood and I'm active
Ralph discontinued rugby, what a shame
Thompson line 'bout to drop, 'bout to rock my own things
Kushgod, Bob Marley on my chain
This ain't Jesus smoking weed, motherfucker what you think

[Hook: Smoke DZA]
This goes out to all the dudes that use
Disrespectful views on the king of NY
If it's beef why try, I put rings on ya eyes
I ain't a king then I wanna know why
I said this goes out to all the dudes that use
Disrespectful views on the king of NY
If it's beef why try, I put rings on ya eyes
I ain't a king then I wanna know why

Riiiiiight
Kushgod bitch.... RFC.... 911, Jet Life

[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
We are a force you can believe in
I'm just looking for some roll-ups So I can put my weed in
Pounds of justice, 9 nigga live niggas not to be fucked with
Roaring, walking in through the crowd keep it rolling like Rylands
I don't hear niggas, not a Deadman, all if you think I try to spear niggas
Kill 'em what good is a witness? Ah fuck it it's good for business
The walls is here, she can't last in the wards for real
Just rolled up the blunt the size her arm
The shit hittin' on some triple power Bong
Believe in the kill
Smoker's Club, that's Believe In The Shield (Shield)
I be's in the field, at an moment 30 P's in your grill
Brave nigga get a grave nigga strapped and get clapped make a pack or we fall
Fake nigga pump your breaks nigga putting on a act like he scrap till we swarm
Ambush, I'm Ambrose, you gots to respect my handle
Real nigga, and I ain't dancing 'round like fandango

[Verse 2: Zombie Juice]
Been the man up in this shit
Body slam 'em, kill them quick
Body slam 'em, kill 'em shit
Elbow drop 'em, show stop 'em
Niggas don't know when I come up in the door
Kick his shit break glass when I intro
When I intro, blowing on that indo
Stone Cold smoke flow essential
Best in the world, I don't care what you think
Fuck yall niggas have a Twist of Fate
Kitchen sink, fresh ass mink
Woo-Ha! Fuck yall think?
Bust em bust em lay em down
Sharpshooter where's the crowd?
Boss Man run the town
Flossing all around

[Verse 3: Erick Arc Elliot]
Major bread, razor's Edge
Hardcore nigga take pain instead
I don't know hit the guillotine
Flaming chance then I hit you with a DDT
What you really mean?
Heaven knows I never back down
Never sleep a ho, make her tap out
Smoker headband Jimmy Fly Snuka steez
Top rop jump off 1, 2, 3
Get the coffin, choke-slam
All apart of a program
So Raw so focused
No pause, no dope shit
No clowns, no joint shit, pointless
Stone Cold got bodies on hold
God Father flow shine on you hoes
Stone Cold got bodies on hold
God Father flow shine on you hoes

[Verse 4: Meechy Darko]
Stay tye die like Devon or Bubba
Monday night RAW, fuck a whore no rubber
Listen to the teller, tell her gimme all the cash
Cause I robbed the biggest bank in a Mankind mask
Diesel and some hash, mothafucka DUI
And I'm posted in the sky like Jimmy, super fly
Sneak her into my layer
Then told her to take off her under-layer
Invade her like Vader
Oh you talkin' shit
See the edge of my razor or jackknife
Fuckin shootin star
Press him if he don't act right, Dead Dibiase
You know I'm bout cash right (CHA-CHING)

My niggas sell dust to buy gold
My niggas sip tusk to move slow
Y'all niggas talk shit, but y'all don't know
Bitch
Load the spaceship with the rocket fluid motherfucker

[Outro: ]
1 year later and the story stays the same
We come in, we dominate, we win and we leave
Why?
Because were the best thing going and we said it since day 1
You better start believing in us if you don't already[Verse 1]
Right, I'm from where ebonics is proper grammar
Little niggas squeeze hammers
Credit card scammer's, one hundred-fifty grammer's
Mover's and shaker's, watch the crooks loomin'
Type of nigga steal your pack and help you look for it
Real shit on wax, don't need no hook for it
I need a movie and a book for it, listen here
If this rap game is like the street game then I been prepared
No pressure, I be cooler than central air
Dark nights, don't be a lone victim
Young shooters turned old hitmen, where I'm from
I'm just a young nigga trying to get dollars to feed my baby's yo
My bills late, but I paid them though
My bitch annoying, that's my lady though
Agree to disagree, I guess that's just the way we roll
Now that I'm getting it, I remind her of the days
When I was rapping for no money like an intern not getting paid
A nigga was living off rhyme and noodles, sixteen-five the train
I just made thirty in a month, gosh look how things changed
Niggas say the fame made you change
Going through the bullshit, how could you ever be the same

[Hook x2]
Nothing is overlooked
Page for page cause my life is like an open book
Life and times of the big fella
Guaranteed to be a best seller

[Verse 2]
Low Impala flying towards traffic on a one way
Minutes after acts of random gun play
Shit'll get worse before it gets better, one day
Grandma said she prayed for me every Sunday
Hand to hand, lost a couple grams
Fucking with a middle man, thirsty for a lick
Hit my man on the arm, and he got set up
Caught him slipping like Stacks Edwards, another sad record story
Only a boss bounce back from his loss
Like he ain't been through shit before
Valuable lesson when you getting burned
Only when you cut the nigga off, that's when a lesson learned
Court adjourned, case closed, friend turned foes
Heating up in a matter of minutes like microwave dinners, nigga
Love and hates is the same shit
You gotta worry about a nigga when he's indifferent

[Hook x2][Smoke DZA]

Big, bad, dangerous
Bronson, DZA, riiiiiiiiight

[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]

She's heavy, no Jager
Sour in the chamber
Bam Bam Bronson
And Big Gram Vader
Big, bad, dangerous
Guyanese nigga with a wild Albanian
Mobbing through the stadium
Them little niggas came and went
Bars on the platter, should be catering
Anybody can get it, no matter what lane you in
We came to win, you came to play
Shit, I want the top spot
For that, ack
I'm on your ass like everyday
Disappear like Hoffa
At Little Charlie's, penne alla vodka
Like a fucking mobster, huh
Wiseguys don't carry wallets
Shit I'm liable to
Run up in Rugby and go toss a couple of fazools
Know how I do, made man
Shouts to Thirstin and Meyhem
N-Y Giant, word to Strahan
DZA!

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]

Bronsolino, we got this
Yo

I'm Greg "The Hammer" Valentino, Tinoisamoa haberdashery
Got seven patches
Coming through with Patra
Speaking patois
Tuna tartare
Snap my fingers for the waiter
Tell him the food was caca
Cause I'm used to plates rated by Zagat
Smoking Kiefer Sutherland
Fuck the government, cop Asian rubs and shit
Paid like a hundred, I'm consistently blunted
Got the fronts right out of Busy Bee
13 Huarache's out of King and Queens
Every other week cause I'm a sneaker fiend
Stole my mother's car
And got falefel right on Bleecker Street
Kool G. Rap was pumping out the speaker, chief
I'm getting brain and rolling up
I'm in the green Caprice
Me and DZA treat the tree like Edward Scissor-
Hands of stone, well nowadays I'm getting tan in Rome
The boat, sleep six, the mussels at the bay
Don't ever get it twisted, dog
We hustle everyday

[Verse 3: Smoke DZA]

We got kids to feed
Niggas ridicule before they help
Got to get it how you live, dog
Them bills don't pay theyself
Whether 16 bars or 28 ounces
Whatever I do
I make it count, kid (That's right)

[Verse 4: Action Bronson]

Yo, I'm the captain of this fly shit
Futuristic hybrid
Never close my eyelids
Dicking down a Thai bitch
Her thighs thick like a rhino skin
Ayo, I'm diving in
Slide it back and forth like a violin (Right)

[Verse 5: Smoke DZA]

Miri Ben-Ari
Mami, ven aqui
No gordo digging that toto loco
Them other niggas so-so
Half assed, mediocre at best
42nd Street, they would've got left
Feel what I'm saying?

[Verse 6: Action Bronson]
Chicharron de pollo con hueso
Been flavor
Table cloth is beautiful
Penetration, uterial
Clenbuterol help when reciting the lyrics
Some family no longer with us
But still behind us in spirit

[Smoke DZA]

I said we big, bad, dangerous
Ain't a motherfucker taming us

[Action Bronson]

Right
Know your role or get rolled on
Don't risk it
It's big business
Big business[Verse 1: J. Ivy]
From the Ivory Coast to Brownsville
Bed-Stuy, St. Louis, Detroit
Memphis, Jackson, Rosewood, Harlem
This is Tulsa before the bombings
Black Wall Street
We haul heat ‘cause we want options
Made it through America’s great adoption
Went from being stuck to getting stacked
Hustling blocks to getting racks
They fashion our design ‘cause we don’t slack
They fear the idea of independence being black

[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]
Riiiight! Uh! What’s the business? I am the business
They give you the fantasy story, here go the realness
If a rapper ain’t doing no shows its probably slow
‘Cause most niggas doing it always be on the road
No 3-60’s less it’s waves spinning
Them whack deals ain’t designed for no niggas winning
I’m over the weak advances
Distribute your own shit, it’s better chances
Fighting the same battle as Ye
But don’t worry, we got the answer, Sway
Invest into your dreams nigga
What I created is what I rock today
Uh, motivated times two
You could do anything you put your mind to
No ownership, it ain’t worth the deal
On my Percy Miller shit, I’ma persevere

[Hook: Smoke DZA]
Black business
Independently ran
Black independence

[Verse 3: J. Ivy]
We make bread, break bread
This is black dollar power
The black dollar hour
I hear cowards saying why y’all talking about getting cash
I want the future to read about us living in the projects in they history class
That’s what I’m on
Trying to get y’all to look past getting on to getting loans
Let’s own the bank
I don’t know about you
But I want my great great great greats to be straight

[Verse 4: Smoke DZA]
Independent as fuck, I own me
Publish shit, merchandise, show money
If I don’t kill my food I won’t eat
You see all my moves, that’s all me
Controlling my own destiny
Knowing the value of my equity
You got to hold your turf
They’ll try to give you what they want, nigga know your worth
Uh, you’ll get what you negotiate
So sticking to your guns is the only way
Successful free agent
Couple homies fighting for they freedom while they caged in
I ain’t tryna be on land caged in
Nah, I’ma need the whole enchilada nigga
God bless you
Criticize but you don’t cut no checks so I respect you
Really can’t tell me shit, look at my credentials

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Jay Ivy]
Imagine a billion black billionaires
Everybody happy, everybody living fair
We ain’t on world dominance, just refuse to be dominated
We will be accommodated
Everything comes around full circle
You can’t mess up the rotation and laws of nature
Tired of putting vacations on layaway and payment plans
Fuck fly kicks, I’m tryna put my feet in the sand
And have enough to pay for land and other land

[Verse 6: Smoke DZA]
I’m my own boss
Touring like 40 days and 40 nights
The tour bus turned into an arc
Who else you know sell out shows in Denmark
No deal, no big co-signs from no stars
Just bars, my G
Sinatra shit, I did it my way and did me
I’m just tryna be a better me
They hate Sean (Ha-tian like Tussaint but they could never rob me from my legacy
They ha-tian like Tussaint but they could never rob me from my legacy
Positive energy
Peace to my brother, Dom Kennedy

[Hook][Verse 1: Trademark Da Skydiver]
Real niggas coming up, fake niggas laying down
Trademark I'm here to stay, guaranteed you'll see me 'round
Stuntin' in some sharp apparrel, khaki slacks, I'm 'laxed and casual
With a focused mind, I'm on a straight of narrow
I just want what's mines, that's only natural
Large estates, cherry wood floors with marble statues
I see it in my dreams, so I know it's coming for me
Niggas tryna block my shine, trust me I ain't worried
Back against the wall, I'm yelling, "fuck 'em all"
I came here to ball, right hand on my balls
Left hand middle fingers up cuz I don't give a fuck
You can tell from my attitude I'm getting bucks
Strong kush in the cones got a nigga stuck
I'm headed to the top, momma wish me luck
Haters wish I fail, even though I will prevail
That's just how I feel, but only time will surely tell

[Hook: Smoke DZA]
Uh, It's a real nigga outing
So I'mma wear what I wanna wear, Right
Hustlin', I'm mad where I'm at dawg
Bitches call me when the money there
I pull up, pick up, now grip up
Uhhh, and if you hustlin'
Put your bands up, bands up
And all my real G's stand up and what? Riiight

[Verse 2: Young Roddy]
And I hotbox the whip, I make it hard for her to breathe
My pound game official, make a broad don't want leave
Got bags under my eyes from no sleep
Got cash under my bed from '03, one love to my plug
That nigga put me on my feet, it's still fuck them niggas
Tell 'em I'm rolling one deep, I ain't scared fool, whats beef?
To a cattle who lost his peeps, us ghetto kids
Keep more than a trick up our sleeve, I ain't doing that just for me
This for my sisters and my C's
Or men thats in these streets like A-wax, I ride D's
I pray they keep their face on, my niggas with disbelief
No disrespect girl, but til I'm gone it's M.O.B
That chopper on that front seat like fuck it, its M-O-me
I got it out that modern Nike shoes, now no cleats
They label me a beast, "you better than me?" "nigga, please."
A rebel 'til I leave, and 'til I leave, its J-E-T, oouutt

[Hook: Smoke DZA]

[Verse 3: Smoke DZA]
Two years ago I was chopping O's
Now I get pound money to rock a show
The OG's like "little pappa go"
Fly to H-town just to hit Pappadeaux
I'm too popular to be normal
Die off that OG every night, fool, I'm immortal
One time for my little bro, little doobies
Just a few months and I smoke, and everything'll be gucci
Kushed God, you looking at a new breed
My N.O. niggas will kill for me like I'm Drew Breeze
Hustler, slash, author
See that a rotten apple just another dirty New Yorker
Show stopper, hoes jock him, think he's awesome
Go rock 'em, big Cuban looking flawless
So tell them non-believers they can hold my Johnson
King of New York, nigga, Rugby Thompson[Produced by Harry Fraud]

Kush god
K.O.N.Y
Riiiight

I ain't the one to fuck with
Criminal minded ain't no Boogie Down production nigga
Just destruction, no discussion
In New York the only other big nigga running shit is my brother from Flushing
Say somethin', I'm headhuntin'
Niggas act weird I get you niggas out of here
Soprano shit, call a hit
Sip a beer, by time I roll something you be in the trunk like a spare
911 niggas in the drama frequent
Think you Willie Dynamite let your momma feel it
Nigga prob(??) like the Lama speaks
Subliminals don't bother me, fuck y'all niggas honestly
Movie shit, go and get your Goobers
You respect the victim I respect the shooter
Separate the winners from the losers
Shit ain't been the same since 2Pac moved to Cuba

I'm the realest nigga here you all welcome
I'm the realest nigga here you all welcome
I'm the realest nigga here you all welcome
I'm the realest nigga here you all welcome
I'm on the grind all day all night nigga
Now throw the butter in the pot, let the rice simmer
I'm on the grind all day, all night nigga
Now throw the butter in the pot, let the rice simmer

No riff raff, my niggas bring the rice out
(Al dog) got the party drug for your nights
Near low, creeping with the hammer don't bring your ice out
First nigga make a slight move move, it's lights out
Going in for the kill like my niggas from the CHI
Gotta get it now, sink or swim, do or die
So coup d'etat, fuck around (for for??) the booby try
Take out your leader see how your crew react
Picture me rollin, high res(?)
I'm on you nigga's heads like Hugo Chavez
Smokey got the buddha, that Buddha I said
Scoota, Phil Rizzuto and low threats
You're now tuned into the Harlem slick talker
Soul and a hustle of an old New Yorker
Every big move, I got sayin' it
You bet your bed nigga, lay in it[Intro]

Nostra, nostra.. Ricky Hil

[Hook: 2X]

Daddy wanna Chevy
Momma got a caddy
Hoes wanna fuck me
Bitches wanna have me
Smoking cherry pie
Cherry Pie
Cherry Pie
Cherry Pie
Cherry Pie

[Verse 1: Ricky Hil]

Bitch I'm to swag for that lame shit
I don't really give a fuck what your name is
I don't really give a fuck if your famous
I just want to bust a nut where your face is
Ill poppin pills Give them bitches Molly
Ricky Hil SlickVille is what they call me
Give her Cherry Pie, got her very high
I can't deny the Cherry Pie be burning very nice
Black Chevy bitch, fast Ford
Got the pills and the weed in the dashboard
We about a half away from bridgeport
Misfit state of mind what I live for

[Hook]

[2nd Verse: Smoke DZA]

Riiiiiiight!
It's the kush god you know I'm very high
Like martin in life tryna get to that Cherry Pie, cherry pie heavy eyes
Amateurs try to hit this out of a bong shit I bet he die
Cough up a lung off this joint I brung
Bound to have a nigga done, sprinkled 'bout a gram of hash
Sure to have you on your ass
Only iron man could smoke with me
I sleep him in the long run
Niggas know George Kush loaded on one

[Hook]

[3rd Verse: Ricky Hil]

Get it poppin bitches
I make it happen captain
I'm the illest bitches
Hoes love my accent
I dont have one
I walk a bad one
I spark a fat one
Heavy weight motherfucker, 484
Crown vic with my arm rested on the door
Heavy weight motherfucker ain't a metaphor
484, them bitches want more
I get it for the low, I get it for the cheap
I rock my pants low, my hat say Supreme
I'mma ill motherfucker baby ain't I
I'mma ill motherfucker baby ain't i
