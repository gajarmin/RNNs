So put your head between your legs and touch your toes
Bounce your booty up and down ooh girl there you go

On the track come on

[Choppa]
Ooh girl you looking good, give lil Choppa a holla
Cause I could take you out that Baby Phat, and put you in Prada
Choppa Style came from nothing, to having some change
Now everybody's in my face, wanting to look at me strange
Now I ain't even got a Range yet, but that's alright baby
Cause I ain't got my change yet, and I ain't nice
And I ain't right, and I ain't flipping chicks
But I ain't really nothing nice, when I'm spitting hits
You feel this shit, then won't you bob your head back and forward
And if you like the way it sound, go to the store and sco' it
You see me, I'm low key, cause I got this
And Choppa style dropping nothing but some hot hits, some hot hits
I can't wait, till I'm living lavage, call me Choppa
Tim Smooth, cause I gotta have it
And this not for a career, its all for fun
And I'm not from St. Louis, but I'm number one, I'm number one

[Chorus: Jahbo - 2X]
Girl you looking good, come and ride with me
Hop in my 6 you looking nice, in them Prada jeans
So won't you drop it, bend it over, touch your toes for me
Bend it, make that booty wiggle wobble out for me

[Choppa]
I got your head board banging, ooh la-la-la
When I ask you who you loving, you say Chop-Chop-Chop
I'm making it hot, coming through and breaking your twat
Don't you worry bout twenty minutes, cause I ain't gonna stop
You say you wanna get served wobble, so I'm gon find you
You say you wanna hot boy, with a condo
How you like it, from the back or your legs in the air
You could ride it, you could dodge it girl, I just don't care
Cause I'ma serve it like I beat it, like I chop it like a dog
I'ma make you touch your toes, sit you down and break you off
To you fat girls, I don't discriminate on y'all
If you can break me with your wiggle, I'll do you like a dog
I want a slim, fine woman, so I could break her cousin
Cause Choppa's like Popeye's chicken, you gotta love him
The next time you think, that you won't get served proper
I got your head board banging, p.s. just love Choppa

[Chorus - 2X]

[Choppa]
I want a slim, fine woman, who as cute as the (what)
Never ever labeled a duck, but always quick to buck
A attitude sometimes, but not a project child
But if needed to bend some piece, she acting project style
And she walk like a model, when she up in them streets
Prada pants, Prada purse, Prada shoes on her feet
She don't hang with messy chickens, cause she say that they sad
They already know the difference, its lust they got it bad
She don't listen to, what you say bout me and them broads
She never listen from the jump, though her head is hard
If she tell me she gon leave me, so my heart ain't gon stop
I get a playa bring a mill, and my woman I'll watch
And oh, tell your baby daddy, he ain't got nothing on me
Going rounds and he gon shoot me, tell him up it and see
Oh, you wonder how she really got that mark on her chest
Ask your girl, she'll probably tell you, but that ain't nothing but mess

[Chorus - 4X][Hook]
Why don't you shake it like that, keep shaking it up
Jiggle and wiggle your butt, baby don't stop it because I
Love when you shake it like that, keep making it drop
I'm paying fifty a whop, cause I don't want you to stop
Not when you shake it like that, me and my whole crew
Thinking of what we can do, if I could leave with you cause I
Love when you shake it like that, this the New No Limit
Baby keep making it wiggle, don't stop it jiggle cause I
Love when you shake it like that

[Choppa]
Oh you a thick woman, oh yeah you looking good
No time for small talking, girl you forget the wood
Game swallow that, where the models at
I'm with the New No Limit, baby holla back
They call me Choppa-Chop, she call me Choppa Style
They call me Choppa Stizzle, stands for off the hizzle
I went from Fat-Fat, to 106 & Park
They saw me on the Basement, now chickens wanna talk
Now I don't really mind, cause I hit a dime
I like em slim fine, big fine any kind
Choppa make you, take it like that
But me and my click, really

[Hook]

Chicks trash my truck, so what I got another Range
Everywhere that we be, Cali to D.C

And I'm all about a dolla dolla, nobody hotta hotta

When I pull up at the club in a big black
Truck on dubs (these niggas gon hate)
Cause I'm doing big thangs, and I got a lot of ice
In my chain (these niggas gon hate)
When I come through the door, and take all the hoes
I know (these niggas gon hate)
Cause I'm playing with some chips, and I make a lot of hits
I know (these niggas gon hate)

[Curren$y]
I don't know if it's the Porsche or the Lamb, that make these niggas
Hate me, like I'm a member of the Klu Klux Klan
I mean god damn, how much money I got in my hand
Really don't concern you man
But I know why you niggas boot me up
Cause I come through pushing brand new Coupes and stuff
You say you wanna shoot me up
Because I got a pair of Jordans won't be out for at least two months
They call me Curren$y the Hot Spitter
And that's cause I keep my money, in stacks
I know they got hatas out to jack niggas
So that's why I ride, with my gat
A Glock and a mask in the dash of the Jaguar, and that's a X-K-8
And if you cross me, you'll die dog
So I advise y'all, please don't hate

[Hook: Krazy]
When I walk in the club and the bitch
Touching bread starts smiling (these niggas gon hate)
When I buy the bar, hit the flo' just start wilding
You feel that (these niggas gon hate)
When them tires on the Navi just keep on spinning
Look at that shit man (these niggas gon hate)
In the club thugged out, with my P. Miller denim
Nigga see that (these niggas gon hate)

[Krazy]
With a high rich I get I still remember, the bad times
In the Ville rock hustling, with a loaded nine
All the niggas said I'd never make it, be friends now
All the dick-riders see this bitch, take a while
All the hoes that never liked me, wanna fuck me
I'll two-way you for some head, you can trust me
It must be this tank, or the shiny gold teeth
Make these hoes get wet, everytime I speak
These streets I push weight, silent nigga
Unless you turn me into a, violent nigga
Smiling in my face, nigga hate behind my back
And you wonder why these bitch ass niggas get smacked
No fear of the police, only the feds
Catch him snitch late night, I'll bust his head
No love for these hating niggas, or the informants
Ask bank run about me, my account's enormous

[Hook: Choppa]
When I'm walking through the mall, I'm chilling with my dogs
Or my girl (these niggas gon hate)
I don't even notice nigga why you spoke to this

This the New No Limit (these niggas gon hate)
And all the ladies love Choppa, cause they know
He's such a poppa but all (these niggas gon hate)

[Choppa]
Niggas gonna hate no matter what you do
So if you don't fuck with me, I don't fuck with you
And I could care less, who did what with who
See I love when you hate, so do what you do
Rolaid, I understand that's your crew
But them cats ain't got no love for you
Y'all wonder why, your careers and you died
Cause your songs sound the same, like you doing a lie
Don't wanna do nothing else, then shake the streets
That's why I'm glad big rap gave a dang to me
And my nigga Master P gave the flame to me
Making hits after hits, what it came to be
Not just a boss rapper, but a hot m.c
All them other niggas sound like me, think about it
I'm Choppa, that Westbank show stopper
If you sick of me, then nigga go see a doctor

[Hook]
When I pull up at the club in a big black
Truck on dubs (these niggas gon hate)
When I buy the bar, hit the flo' just start wilding

Cause I'm playing with some chips, and I make a lot of hits

While you walking I'm running, while you shooting I'm chopping

And I'm all about a dolla dolla, nobody hotta hotta

We in the club pop a bottle, at the bar
Tell your girl stop tripping, she could holla at a star
Hypnotic in the car, is all I need to get mean
We could mix it with henny, and we turning it green

Waiting on the word from P, just to rush a fucking nigga

Ya old lady mad at me, Wanna know why I dont call her
Heh, I keep chrome on my whip, Chrome on my waist
Come with that bullshit, See what you'll get, A hole in ya face
My niggas pull quick, Plenty of clips, Bullets to waist
Give me the toughest judge, I bet they'll still throw out the case

What you-what you think about that Choppa cat brah
That dude that be aaah, (what the fuck is a aaah anyway
Ain't nobody talk about the Westbank in like ten years
He the first one, what the fuck is a Wild West Biggity anyway
I wish, somebody let me know the nigga be talking bout some crazy shit
What the fuck he tal'n bout, he said his name like three hundred times
In one fucking song), Choppa Style, Chop-Chop-Choppa Style
(what is that he ain't saying nothing, all I know is his name
I know it real well I don't even know his face, what the fuck)

[Choppa]
Just because, I got me deal
Doesn't mean I got a big head, can't hook up with my people and chill
I'ma rap, until I'm blue in the face
To keep my money and my fans understand, I'ma do what it takes
I never was fake, everything I'm spitting is real
I was hungry I was hustling, so I'm getting a deal
Flipping my skills flipping the scale, whatever it takes
I'll put a hater in the dirt, and kick a verse at his wake
Yeah I learned that from Ken, when he had the streets locked
They had the heat that made you fade away, like a bleek spot
They even had lil' guns, sound like grease pops
And so much candy, you would think it was sweet shops
Now I done done shows with Jigga, smoked with Juve
Hooked up with Ja Rule, and felt some booty
Had hoes claiming that, they wanted to screw me
I'm bout my money, not bout what them bitches that would do me
Cause I'm in this to win this, so give me a mic
I'ma spend this and send this, and back to you like
Yeah, I'ma break em off proper-prop
Man fuck a nigga hating, on Choppa-Chop come on

(*Money & Hype talking*)
Man the nigga can't even rap, I heard his Hypeman writing his song
Then I go check out his show, he slanging his winkie the whole show
I don't wanna see his winkie, I wanna see what he talking bout

[Choppa]
Niggas going off, what a nigga done told ya
But I got fifty niggas, who willing to show ya
I ain't even talking bout guns, let me blow ya
I got niggas down, from Mararoe to the Magnolia
Yeah, now these niggas getting in line
Like they had scoliosus, and I was bout to fix they spine
And all I do, is spit these rhymes
I don't aim at the bullseye, but I seem to hit each time
And I heard that fake shit, that you said in your song
Let a nigga make money bitch, leave me alone
All that hating and repping, on Choppa-Chop
Can't get mad, just because a nigga hot you not
And you niggas keep on saying I'm whack
But everytime I see your pop's at the corner sto', he giving me dap
Said, (I wish my son could rap that way)
And I write my own rhymes, ask J-J-J-J-J-M-K

(*Money & Hype talking*)
Man fuck Choppa basically, he ain't doing shit

Holla at me (holla at me), holla at me (holla at me)

[Choppa]
Niggas cash your checks, niggas pop your X
Niggas fuck the club, pass while you in your Vette
Niggas fuck a ho, cause you can't trust a ho
Soon as she start tripping whoadie, get another ho
Don't play no games boy, you know my name boy
Don't think cause this the New No Limit, we didn't change boy
We still will fuck you up, we still will hustle up
We still will put the drinks down, and we can knuckle up
I got a rowdy click, we do some rowdy shit
And plus I'm with the man, who created the Bout It shit
I'm from that 5-0-4, I let a top bitch know
I represent it to the finish, I ain't gon die no ho
And my city keep it sizzling, so that fire I blow
Might catch a contact, if I drive by slow
With a tight grip, hand on the wheel of my tight whip
See me at the second line, and all them girls like this

[Hook - 4x]

[Choppa]
Holla pop your collar at me, playa throw a model at me
Thought you knew but now you know, I'm coming from that 5-0-4
Representing for that Boot, where we ain't afraid to shoot
Murder rate be sky high, and plus them boys be jacking too
Plus I'm from that Dirty South, where we put them birdies out
On the grind never sleep, plus we got a dirty mouth
But I was patient, and I was focused
And I was hungry, and look
Now that's why I stack money, like pancakes
Do shows and receive love, from my fan base
Now maybe it's the Jag, or maybe it's the grill
Naw, it's the seven figga million dollar deal

[Hook - 4x]

[Curren$y]
Niggas know what's happening, when the dog swing through
With them 21 inch Giovanni's, under the coupe
I don't need, no introduction
All I need is a pen and a pad, and some nice production
I'm paid, so you know I'ma flaunt it
I do my cars, like supreme pizza I put everything on it
Cadillac truck, with them, spinning thangs on it
Curren$y flow hot, I bet anything on it
You dudes can't do, nothing with me
I spit sick, like a mosquito that had that West Nile bit me
Y'all dudes already know, how we do
And the whip surely ain't mine, if the windows see through

[Hook - 4x](*talking*)
What's up, ah ha, come on
Choppa Style. Jahbo, Playa Will
On the track come on

[Choppa]
Ooh girl you looking good, give lil Choppa a holla
Cause I could take you out that Baby Phat, and put you in Prada
Choppa Style came from nothing, to having some change
Now everybody's in my face, wanting to look at me strange
Now I ain't even got a Range yet, but that's alright baby
Cause I ain't got my change yet, and I ain't nice
And I ain't right, and I ain't flipping chicks
But I ain't really nothing nice, when I'm spitting hits
You feel this shit, then won't you bob your head back and forward
And if you like the way it sound, go to the store and sco' it
You see me, I'm low key, cause I got this
And Choppa style dropping nothing but some hot hits, some hot hits
I can't wait, till I'm living lavage, call me Choppa
Tim Smooth, cause I gotta have it
And this not for a career, its all for fun
And I'm not from St. Louis, but I'm number one, I'm number one

[Chorus: Jahbo - 2X]
Girl you looking good, come and ride with me
Hop in my 6 you looking nice, in them Prada jeans
So won't you drop it, bend it over, touch your toes for me
Bend it, make that booty wiggle wobble out for me

[Choppa]
I got your head board banging, ooh la-la-la
When I ask you who you loving, you say Chop-Chop-Chop
I'm making it hot, coming through and breaking your twat
Don't you worry bout twenty minutes, cause I ain't gonna stop
You say you wanna get served wobble, so I'm gon find you
You say you wanna hot boy, with a condo
How you like it, from the back or your legs in the air
You could ride it, you could dodge it girl, I just don't care
Cause I'ma serve it like I beat it, like I chop it like a dog
I'ma make you touch your toes, sit you down and break you off
To you fat girls, I don't discriminate on y'all
If you can break me with your wiggle, I'll do you like a dog
I want a slim, fine woman, so I could break her cousin
Cause Choppa's like Popeye's chicken, you gotta love him
The next time you think, that you won't get served proper
I got your head board banging, p.s. just love Choppa

[Chorus - 2X]

[Choppa]
I want a slim, fine woman, who as cute as the (what)
Never ever labeled a duck, but always quick to buck
A attitude sometimes, but not a project child
But if needed to bend some piece, she acting project style
And she walk like a model, when she up in them streets
Prada pants, Prada purse, Prada shoes on her feet
She don't hang with messy chickens, cause she say that they sad
They already know the difference, its lust they got it bad
She don't listen to, what you say bout me and them broads
She never listen from the jump, though her head is hard
If she tell me she gon leave me, so my heart ain't gon stop
I get a playa bring a mill, and my woman I'll watch
And oh, tell your baby daddy, he ain't got nothing on me
Going rounds and he gon shoot me, tell him up it and see
Oh, you wonder how she really got that mark on her chest
Ask your girl, she'll probably tell you, but that ain't nothing but mess

[Chorus - 4X](*talking*)
Whaa-whaa-what's up whoadie what's up
B. Gizzle, and my dog Choppa Stizzle
You understand, K-Nizzle on the trizzack
And this some G-code shit, you know
We let em gotta let em say it, gotta let em hang
Cause it ain't no thang, look

[B.G.]
I ain't the one to be repping stunting, or bragging nigga
But I got a G coupe, and a Benz wagon nigga
I pull up you know hoes, they harass a nigga
I'm thugging t-shirt, Reebok's and bo's sagging nigga
To let you know, Gizzle ain't just rapping nigga
Keep that Glock 40, and that bitch plastic nigga
Ready to flash it nigga, play me I ain't gon have it nigga
You end up, in a casket nigga
I'm bout my bidness, ain't bout playing and laughing nigga
I take measures, you know that they drastic nigga
Choppa Style and Chopper City, straight macking nigga
Game tight, never never lacking nigga
You got dogs, I suggest you ask a nigga
They'll tell you I'm bout killing, jacking kidnapping nigga
Before you step, I advise you get practice nigga
The number one Hot Boy, triple platinum nigga

And I got a household name, like Arm-&-Hammer
And keep shit deep in the vest, to get me the slammer

Where we ride slow, windows down pounds to blow
You wanna happen in Mokwestas, won't you ask me please
Hate the way I rap hustle, and I stack's my G's

Chicks trash my truck, so what I got another Range
Everywhere that we be, Cali to D.C
Chicks pointing and grinning, cause they see me on TV

[Hook - 2x]

The way she backing and working that thang, that's throwed
6-5-4 she high, now let's go oh

[5th Ward Weebie]
You gotta rock-rock-rock-rock-rock the boat
I heard you was a head hunter, with a sloppy throat
Now like a man, come and break it off and let Weebie you understand
Now you know this boy go off
Now come on baby won't you back it up, I'm about to smack it up
That ass sitting low, so I guess I gotta jack it up
Put you on the wall and make you holla, ooh daddy
Call your other girl, and toss that thang like a salad
No I ain't no freak, I'm just a little bit nasty
I like a one night stand, I ain't trying to get married
5th Ward  Weebie, got them girls going crazy
After I get with em, they be trying to have babies
Look at shorty she throwed, she working that there
Fat Boy Entertainment, gon serve that there
You know I like 'em throwed off, first time clothes off
Shit I ain't tripping, I got plenty I could roll something

[Hook - 2x]

[Mike Jones]
I want a cutie, that could drop it like it's hot
And do tricks with the booty
A floozy that'll straight up, tell me she wanna do me
A girl that can twerk and squirt on it, like she knew me
In the streets she classy, in the sheets she nasty
Doing shit for me without me even much asking
Mike Jones, she's 36-25-34
Cute face slim waste, need I say more
These girls, in Clutch City
Come equipped, with big hips lips and titties them big old thangs
You wanna jump in leather wood, then drop your g-string
Let your tongue hang, and show off your tongue ring
Now play with it, slowly lick your lips with it
And show all the tricks, that you can do with it
That g-string you got on, got everybody watching
Niggas bopping, and them hating hoes knocking
Cause your feet really nice, your teeth ice white
You the throwed lil' mama, I been looking for all night
So just come with Mike Jones, walk with Mike Jones
So when I'm done with your ass, you gon crawl for Mike Jones

[Hook - 2x]

[Choppa]
You don't want it with me, I'm just popular
Now these people, pay to party with me
I got girls in the V.I.P., getting it on
And they ain't leaving, till they show they thong
Some slim some big, some know they wrong
But they all act a fool, when they hear my song
I'm Choppa-Choppa, yeah I got another one
Street baller Body Head, did I-did I stutter son
I'm wilding out, off a bottle of Henn
Got a line of girls waiting, at the Holiday Inn
Mike Jones and Choppa-Chop, always flocking 'em in
But I'm stopping again, cause she ain't hot as your friend
Yeah I told your girl, don't hate a playa
But if you is a throwed chick, you can page a playa
I heard 5th Ward Weebie, got them hoes off the heezie
Your boy lil' Choppa, bout to break 'em off proper
And I heard, when she want the right song
Who she call for Mike Jones, holla at your boy
Houston and New Orleans, ain't no way you gon serve me
Choppa-Choppa hold it down, representing that Dirty

(*outro*)
She want Chop-Chop
She love Chop-Chop - 3x
She want, she want, she want, she want
She want Mike Jones - 4x
She want, she want, she want, she want
She want, she want
