[Hook]
You say you a gangsta, that don’t impress me none
You say you a gangsta, ain’t seen a thing you've done
I do it all on myself, I ain’t getting help
From no one, from no one

[Verse 1]
Yeah I’m young, 21, living in a crazy world
But I know the difference between a man and a hood
You frontin’ like you got it, claim they hatin’ on your wallet
Gucci telling you the time and you watch it
No I ain't stunting like my daddy, he’s livin’ with my granny
Used to be a big baller, he's surviving off of gambling
But I love him he’s my daddy, yeah I love him he’s my daddy
Put him in a big house before I ever see a Grammy
And my mommy started working days at the church
Finding faith in God cause the real world hurts, so much evil lurks
They just make us work but we can’t find work
Abuela, mommy and the girls in a one bedroom
South beach lifestyle, they just paying for the view
Mommy on the couch since she was 42
Sacrificing for the kids cause that’s what mommies do
So I smoke my spliff, I spliff it hard
Candi says to stop, my voice is getting too harsh
So I sobered up and my thoughts they rush
And now I think of you behind bars
Cross state lines, they spliffing good
In Miami you catch a charge and the whole family tears apart

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
And this recession so depressing
My parents don’t stop stressing
Just hoping I learned all their lessons
Mmm and I’m paying for this session, I’m paying for this session
And I’m paying rent, food, clothes, phones, christmas presents
Six shots in, I’m just counting all my blessings
No days off baby, I ain’t resting
I told my sins, now I'm done confessing

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
One way to the top, I'll make with what I got
You want my number, baby, I’m on a mission, catch up
Men selling love like thieves
But when the girlie leaves he’ll start flirting with me
So I took my heart off my sleeve
Never trust a man cause they all hungry
Yeah, they all hungry
Never trust a man cause they all hungry

[Bridge x2]
Right when you thought you had me
Baby, you just lost someone
Finally got over you
Baby, time to move on
Never learned your lesson
Ain’t even gon' question
Why it went so wrong

[Outro]
You say you a gangsta, that don’t impress me none
You say you a gangsta, ain’t seen a thing you done[Hook]
Dices ser un gangsta
Tú no me impresiona
Dices que eres un gangsta
Pero no has visto na’
Lo hago todo sola
A mi no me ayuda nadie, nadie

[Verse 1]
Si, soy joven, pero no bruta con 21
Tu no me asustas
Vivo en un mundo donde se juzga
Por la malicia y no si te educas
Ta bien, ‘ta bien
Esta diciendo lo que no es
Hablando y no tiene ni cien
Ya no creo lo que dicen
Yo no soy como mi papa
El ‘ta viviendo con su mama
Es un sobreviviente de los casino y de los juegos
Lo perdio to’ pero el no me perdio a mi
Le voy a comprar una casa
Antes de mi primer Grammy
Mi mama dedico to’ su tiempos a Dios
Pa' encontrar la fe sanar su dolor
Y quitarse el sabor
Arrancarse el color que dejo el dolor
Yo me he marcado la vida
Buscando siempre un salida
Pero nunca me doy por perdida
Mi madre en el sofa
Durmiendo to’ los dias para luego trabajar
Dios te bendiga, ma
Me fumo un blunt pa' recordar
Dicen que mi voz esta poniendo mal
Me pongo ronca, la nota comenzo a bajar
Vuelvo de nuevo a pensar
Y te pienso al otro lado de las rejas
Al otro lado del estado
Donde no es igual que aqui
Porque en Miami si te pescan
No facilmente te sueltan

[Hook]
Dices ser un gangsta
Tú no me impresiona
Dices que eres un gangsta
Pero no has visto na’
Lo hago todo sola
A mi no me ayuda nadie, nadie
Dices ser un gangsta
Tú no me impresiona
Dices que eres un gangsta
Pero no has visto na’
Lo hago todo sola
A mi no me ayuda nadie, nadie

[Verse 2]
Analizando esta situacion
Y son cuarto en una habitacion
Mi mami y papi tristes con la recesion
Ahora todo es bajo de presion
Pero canto esta cancion
Tomas pasion, un fracaso, una leccion
En mi manda el corazon
Yo sola pago esta sesion
En mi renta no hay perdon
Ni cuenta un patron
Ya van seis brindis que doy
Cuento cada bendicion

[Hook]
Dices ser un gangsta
Tú no me impresiona
Dices que eres un gangsta
Pero no has visto na’
Lo hago todo sola
A mi no me ayuda nadie, nadie
Dices ser un gangsta
Tú no me impresiona
Dices que eres un gangsta
Pero no has visto na’
Lo hago todo sola
A mi no me ayuda nadie, nadie

[Verse 3]
Arriba voy a llegar
Dime quien me va a parar
Cuando me quiso llamar
Yo no lo quise escuchar
Y el se enamoro de mi
Desde que me vio camino hacia mi
Yo no creo un hombres
Hambrientos hombres
Mi corazon no esta pa' pasar mas hambre
Ya borré tu nombre
Yo lo borré de mi, ya me olvidé de ti
Yo no confio en nadie
Porque justo cuando tu pensaste
Que tu tenias te olvidé
Y yo he hechado sola pa' lante
Y tu haz pagado tú estupidez
Porque justo cuando tú pensaste
Que tú me tenias te olvidé
Y yo he hachado sola pa’ lante
Sola…

[Outro]
Dices ser un gangsta
Tú no me impresiona
Dices que eres un gangsta
Pero no has visto na’[Intro: DJ Khaled]
Miami! Dade County! Let's ride!

[Verse 1]
I’m from Miami, bitch, yeah, that’s Miami streets
And all the haters want to push us, try to give us heat
Baby, we live in heat, so drop that shit and drop the beat
Let's party in my streets and leave the hotel room with dirty sheets
I’m no holds barred, baby, I’m gung ho
They sayin’, “Girl, you ain’t Jamaican, accent's got to go”
And I say, “Hell no, hell no”
I got Jamaica in my lungs, it’s that good hydro
I got that Barbee flow, I’m feelin’ irie
Party, work and chill on the beach all day
Got Corona in my hands, got that iron in my blood
Got my toes in the sand and my God is the Sun

[Hook] (x2)
I’m shakin’ up the game, trying to test my luck
Living life everyday by what comes up
Yeah, I’m working on some things, getting my weight up
I’m Helen Keller to the hate, I’m sayin’, “What?, what?, what?”

[Interlude]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh

[Verse 2]
We in that heat wave, where people ain’t phased
Workin’ to get paid, this town, they don’t play
The girlies like, “Yay”, they like the heart race
White girl on a white girl’s face, and oh-oh-oh
We do it for the thrills, thrills, thrills
We got enough bills, bills, bills
So keep poppin’ them pills, pills, pills
I’m chillin’ in my booth, feet up, V.I.P
Bring my girls to the damn party
Bro, don’t touch me, I got my own money
If you want a drink for free, show my girls your body

[Hook + Interlude]

[Verse 3]
My town likes to party all of the time
All of the time, take me down to Prime
Give me a steak, if it’s bloody, that’s fine
Got a roach in my pocket, took Mary J to dine
Let me clear my throat, uh (yeah, yeah)
Have mercy, babe, I hope you don’t mind, mind
I’m on a fucking boat, uh (yeah, yeah)
And I’m thirsty babe, pass me the champagne, pagne

[Hook][Verse 1]
Time's been ticking, hearts are runnin'
Think that Cupid's up to somethin'
You asked me how I feel, I say nothin'
But lately color seems so bright
And the stars light up the night
My feet they feel so light
I'm ignoring all the signs
I keep on frontin', yeah I stay bluffin'
I keep you wonderin'
Keep you huntin' for my lovin'
But I crave us huggin'
Yeah I stay stubborn
Cause I can't admit that you got all the strings
And know just how to tug 'em

[Chorus]
I think I'm in love again
(My head, yeah you're in my head)
I think I'm in love again
(My head, yeah you're in my head)
I didn't think that it could be true
Let alone that it would be you
I think I'm in love again
(I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love)

[Verse 2]
My hearts' pacin', I'm confused, I'm dazin'
I saw something I never seen in you, it's got me shakin'
I must be haluscinatin'
I hear it happens, I'm just sayin'
Babe I'm just sayin'
Someone give me some paper
Someone give me some crayons
I'm feeling like a child, I need something to play on
I'm trying hard to trust you when you say "give me a hand"
Baby I'm fallin', I hope you catch me when I land

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
In my dreams you're the dutch and I'm the duchess
And your blunts are always loose so I'm in charge of rollin' dutches
And we getting so high, we always get the munchies
And we go for early brunches that turn into late lunches
And we ain't gotta label, we're just rollin' with the punches
I make fun of your belly and tell you do some crunches
And you say "yeah well your ass jiggles, go and do some lunges"
I say "fuck you" whlie I'm thinking of you as my husband
I think I'm in love

[Chorus]Is it crazy that I want you to stay
When I tell you to leave
When I tell you go
Is it crazy that I say your name
More times a day
Than I say my own
Tell me baby is it crazy?
Tell me baby is it crazy?

Is it crazy when you’re gone for a minute
I’m missing you, Yeah I feel alone
Is it crazy that I’m jealous of them bitches
When they get your time
And I know its wrong
But tell me is it crazy?
Yeah, I need to know if it’s crazy
Damn

Cuz I ain't been myself
Lately somethings going on
Nah boy I ain't even slept
I been up all night long
In my head
Trying to figure out what I want what I do
What I don’t

Is it crazy all them answers is You
Tell me cuz its blowing my mind
Tell me cuz I don’t understand
How someone just can walk into your life
And everything before them you forget

Is it crazy?
Tell me what’s going on
I need to know
Cuz I ain't tryna lose myself
Or lose control
Baby tell me the truth
I need to know
Is it crazy?
Baby is it crazy?

Is it crazy that I told my ex don’t call no more cuz I’m in love?
Is it crazy that I keep your shirt right here just to smell your cologne?
Damn that sounds crazy
Tell me is it crazy

Cus I ain't been myself
Lately somethings going on
Nah boy I ain't even slept
I been up all night long
In my head
Trying to figure out what I want what I do
What I don’t

Is it crazy all them answers is You
Tell me cuz its blowing my mind
Tell me cus I don’t understand
How someone just can walk into your life
And everything before them you forget

Well if it is I’ll just be crazy for you
Baby cuz it’s blowing my mind
Tell me cuz I don’t understand
How someone just can walk into your life
And everything before them you forget

I'm crazy crazy crazy for you [x2][Verse 1: Kat Dahlia]
I'm not gonna cry
No, not this time
These eyes won't stop my tears
They fight to stay inside
If I could just keep dancing
Drown out in this silence
And I can't hear my mind
When thoughts start magnifying
But I can't stop fighting
My hand, it gets so violent
Taped up, bruised and black
Like I did from your hands
Oh baby, oh baby, I'm crazy
I used to see right through you
I'm sipping, I'm drinking
I'm driving, it's crazy
Why can't my mind just lose you?
And no one knows what we've been through
I taught you everything I knew
I gave you everything I could
To show that you was never good
Stranger don't romance me
Cheaper words don't sound fancy
I'm too difficult to decipher
For you to ever break me

[Refrain: Kat Dahlia]
And you don't know me like he did
I'm sorry stranger, you should quit
I just ain't ready for this shit
I'm sorry stranger
I'm sorry stranger, you should quit

[Verse 2: Candy Warhol]
Yo, oh baby, yeah baby
Listen up, if love was a war
I strap up my artillery
Cause it's your heart that I'm fighting for
Just to explore, something special
I truly adore
Cause I wasn't sure what the future for us you had in store
So I step back, told myself to forget that
Feeling that I had when I met you
So my heart wouldn't set back
Now I'm stressed at
A point that I feel has no return
Delete your number from my cell
While I watch yo picture burn
And these thoughts just disappear
Cause me losing you, girl, is my biggest fear
I got big wounds, big cuts
A heart that'll never be stitched up
Cause a now a nigga broken
And my spirits aren't gone lift up
This permanent pain, emotion burning in flames
Along with that picture and the text
I'm making sure that nothing remains
And from here on out, without a doubt
Girl I will never be the same
Nah, I'll never be the same
Girl you know love is pain

[Refrain][Pre-Chorus]
Woah!
Woah!
Sing, sing
Yeah you got a lot of bitches and they got a lot of wishes
They be feenin' for the riches, now you gotta give 'em more

[Chorus]
My garden's wide of daisies
And it's untouched, come play
Check here, my rhythm baby
My sky's been looking grey
My garden's wide of daisies
And it's untouched of sin
My root's been craving lately
To soak in your diamonds
Take it, you want it
And I want you laying on me
My flower beds calling your name

[Bridge](x2)
I'll let your rain fall down if it sparkles like diamonds
Just let me wear the crown, my garden's appetizing

[Pre-Chorus](x2)

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

[Pre-Chorus](x2)

[Outro]
I'm singing woah, woah, yeah
Take it, you want it
And I want you laying on it
I'll have you
I'll have you screaming my name

?[Intro: Kat Dahlia]
So you a gangsta, that don't impress me none
You say you a gangsta, ain't seen a thing you done
I do it all on myself,  I ain't getting help
From no one, from no one

[Verse 1: DaykoN]
Everybody got a problem with me cause i'm beast
And i'm white that's right, I'm here on this track to
Prove you don't need to be black
And that your ideas are whack, Here i stand
With this strand, this life in my hands
I was born to achieve with my own technique
But homies think i deceive too some kind of degree
But i cruise with the bruise of my own choices
Every kid that I know is feeling voiceless
Don't you think I see, what you tryna be
I believe that you better leave, 'fore I cleave
You live in some preconceived idea
Of what a gangsta' should be
Is this a dream, i'm livin' supreme, hatching a scheme
But I can't move cause the water flows upstream
And so, can't reach, it makes me wanna scream
Cause my life is so dry, that's why I feel like i'm living a lie

[Hook: Kat Dahlia]
So you a gangsta, that don't impress me none
You say you a gangsta, ain't seen a thing you done
I do it all on myself,  I ain't getting help
From no one, from no one

[Verse 2:DaykoN]
Hustle like I’m broke
Your stuff is just a joke
It’s all on me and I bet I never choke
I killed your flow with style
Wanted to try this again
I believe inchances
Only in certain circumstances
For example, not in romances
Maybe cus I've been damaged
I can never understand this
Girls always playing games with emotions
Going and making all of this commotion
And then they say its cus you need to show more devotion
And essentially what Im spittin is
A fear of commitment with
Everything that means gettin with
You and everything that you represent
But I'm spent, I made a Splash, earned my Stripes but don't thank me;
Yo, coach.. I'm Cool Running things with "no Candy"
You said a couple things that I find quite funny
But your crew "should've come with a mute" like wise monkeys

[Hook: DaykoN and Kat Dahlia]
So you a gangsta, that don't impress me none
You say you a gangsta, ain't seen a thing you done
I do it all on myself,  I ain't getting help
From no one, from no one[Verse 1: Kat Dahlia]
Black night, white lane

[Bridge]
'Cuz when the clock strikes 12, all the freaks come out and play, eh

I'm crazy crazy crazy for you [x2]Said he was fearless. (Yeah)
Said he was brave

But he was too haunted, to ever be saved
But I faced you, by myself
Every night you, lost a fight to, the stash on your shelf

And you'd breathe, evil in and out
Slowly, awareness is fading out


[Chorus]
Here comes his twisted smile, and that wicked raised eyebrow
Staring at me, Our legs are falling to the ground

And if I try to understand, All the workings of this man
Id be losing every hand, hes at the devils command. (x2)

Said I would leave him (Yeah)
But I would always stay

Didn't have the courage, to leave our love in disarray
So i'd face you, by myself. Every night you, lost a fight to, the stash on your shelf


[Chorus]
And you'd breathe, evil in and out
Slowly, our love is fading out

Here comes his twisted smile, and that wicked raised eyebrow
Staring at me,our legs are falling to the ground

And when I try to understand, all the workings of this man
Id be losing every hand, hes at the devils command. (x2)[Intro]
Guy 1:'S'mofo butter layin' me to da' BONE! Jackin' me up... tight me!
Stewardess: I'm sorry, I don't understand
Guy 2: Cutty say 'e can't HANG!
Woman: Oh stewardess! I speak jive
Stewardess: Oh good!
Woman: He said that he's in great pain and he wants to know if you can help him
Stewardess: All right. Would you tell him to just relax and I'll be back as soon as I can with some medicine?
Woman: Jus' hang loose, blood

[Verse 1]
Could have run to my arms, but you run to the rocks
How do I heal all these scars after you've taken your shots?
And my faith is in my hands and my vice is on my mask
I guess God can't understand what I've been trying to ask
And now I'm losing every hand
And somehow I lost my grasp
And my mind's in chains and bands
From memories of our past
I guess God can't understand
What I've been trying to ask

[Hook x2]
And he says I know, I know, I know, (I know, I know)
I hurt you once before (before, before)
But I can do better (do better, do better, do better)
Please let me do better (better)

[Verse 2]
If I tried to be blind
Through the signs I'd decide
You are real, you are mine
But I ain't blind
I'm ain't trying for you
Baby I resign
And I'm hearing all the chimes
I'll follow til' I find
And if I had a thousand lives
I would leave you a thousand times
And my mind goes through the lines
And memories of your crimes
I ain't trying for you
Baby I resign

[Hook x2]
And he says I know, I know, I know, (I know, I know)
I hurt you once before (before, before)
But I can do better (do better, do better, do better)
Please let me do better (better)

[Verse 3]
Tell myself I couldn't care less
Whatcha doing if you're a mess?
I ain't trying for you
I put you to rest
For a reason
Staying strong is my test
Baby you thought you had me
In my way you did
I realized you ain't shit
Now I don't need you
I can confess
It's for a reason
This is my test

[Hook x2]
And he says I know, I know, I know, (I know, I know)
I hurt you once before (before, before)
But I can do better (do better, do better, do better)
Please let me do better (better)[Intro]

[Verse 1: Kat Dahlia]
He taking one step forward one step back
And it's all a part of his attack
He taking one step forward one step back
Cause he knows I like that

Fireman, oh fireman
Somebody turn up the fan
Oh, I better watch my hands

But I can't stop looking at his body
Baby he is hotter than wasabi
Oh how he seduces with his flame
And his eyes are looking mighty naughty
I know we both know he’s got it
Baby I don’t even know his name

[Hook]
Fireman, oh fireman
Are the flames too hot for you to stand?

[Verse 2: Kat Dahlia]
I'm taking one step forward one step back
Yeah he's got me dancing on this track
And he is showing off the heat he packs
And it's racks on racks on racks on racks

Yeah fireman,oh fireman

Oh baby hes got a plan
Oh I try to run but I can't
And his lighting looks so bright
I've lost my sight of right
And I'm trying with my might to hold back
But he's got me chokin' while I sip
Hes got me smoking like a match
And the combination of the two goes against all the facts

[Hook]
And it's fireman, oh fireman
Are the flames to high for you to stand

[Verse 3: Kat Dahlia]
He's blowing flames out through his gats
And now I'm taking bout ten steps back
But I'm tripping on that free crack
All the lights go out it fades to black
Fireman, oh fireman

Oh baby he had a plan
Oh I can't see where I stand

He's a deciever
But He'll make you a believer
Til he has your ashes in his hand
He likes the smell of flesh burning
He don't deal with no bleeders
Watch him light his match
Watch his smile turn
He don't get what he want then watch him get a little meaner
His fists get stiff and his eyes get stern

He claims he's got the medicine, now babies got the fever
And he'll be there to watch me burn
Burnnnnn Burnnn Burnnnn

[Outro]
Fireman, Oh Fireman
Oh baby he's got a plan
Oh I tried to run but I can't

Fireman, Oh Fireman
Baby he's got a plan
Oh I tried to run but I can't Oh I can't
My Fireman[Verse 1]

You know everything about this train
The wheels movin' already, and that steam is blowin' so heavy

Standin' at the station like a bank with a claim
Pockets empty but ready, cause' my words are stamped and indebted

This is so sweet, you were on the other side of the street, with no seeds
With no trees, ain't' got no green

Dug a hole into my garden, took a piece of every root that I started
Cause' I wasn't guarded. Put my trust in the lust of a dream that you wanted

[Hook]

The witness, the witness, is unjust
(Well there goes my fuckin' trust)
A surface, the purpose, contentious
(Well there goes my fuckin' trust)
The witness, the witness, is unjust
(Well there goes my fuckin' trust.)

Dug a hole into my garden, took a piece of every root that I started
Cause' I wasn't guarded, cause I wasn't guarded

[Verse 2]

You knew everything about this train
These wheels have never been on a track
You took my hand and led me down your path

Its gone too far to start turnin' back
You tryna' say we better than that

When the ink went dry with that pen I signed
You stabbed it in my back

Sick to the stomach, and im sick to the brain
You got a piece of every single word I say

But baby whos to blame?, I bought into the game
Now you got all to gain

[Hook]

This ones for you, the vine with the
This ones for you, the vine with the
This ones for you, the vine with the thorns

And now my gardens all yours
And now my gardens all yours[Hook]
You say you a gangsta, that don’t impress me none
You say you a gangsta, ain’t seen a thing you've done
I do it all on myself, I ain’t getting help
From no one, from no one

No I ain't stunting like my daddy, he’s livin’ with my granny
Used to be a big baller, he's surviving off of gambling
But I love him he’s my daddy, yeah I love him he’s my daddy
Put him in a big house before I ever see a Grammy
And my mommy started working days at the church
Finding faith in God cause the real world hurts, so much evil lurks
They just make us work but we can’t find work

In Miami you catch a charge and the whole family tears apart

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
And this recession so depressing
My parents don’t stop stressing
Just hoping I learned all their lessons
Mmm and I’m paying for this session, I’m paying for this session
And I’m paying rent, food, clothes, phones, christmas presents
Six shots in, I’m just counting all my blessings
No days off baby, I ain’t resting
I told my sins, now I'm done confessing

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
One way to the top, I'll make with what I got
You want my number, baby, I’m on a mission, catch up
Men selling love like thieves
But when the girlie leaves he’ll start flirting with me
So I took my heart off my sleeve
Never trust a man cause they all hungry
Yeah, they all hungry
Never trust a man cause they all hungry

[Bridge x2]
Right when you thought you had me
Baby, you just lost someone
Finally got over you
Baby, time to move on
Never learned your lesson
Ain’t even gon' question
Why it went so wrong

[Outro]
You say you a gangsta, that don’t impress me none
You say you a gangsta, ain’t seen a thing you done[Hook]
Dices ser un gangsta
Tú no me impresiona
Dices que eres un gangsta
Pero no has visto na’
Lo hago todo sola
A mi no me ayuda nadie, nadie

[Verse 1]
Si, soy joven, pero no bruta con 21
Tu no me asustas
Vivo en un mundo donde se juzga
Por la malicia y no si te educas
Ta bien, ‘ta bien
Esta diciendo lo que no es
Hablando y no tiene ni cien
Ya no creo lo que dicen
Yo no soy como mi papa
El ‘ta viviendo con su mama
Es un sobreviviente de los casino y de los juegos
Lo perdio to’ pero el no me perdio a mi
Le voy a comprar una casa
Antes de mi primer Grammy
Mi mama dedico to’ su tiempos a Dios
Pa' encontrar la fe sanar su dolor
Y quitarse el sabor
Arrancarse el color que dejo el dolor
Yo me he marcado la vida
Buscando siempre un salida
Pero nunca me doy por perdida
Mi madre en el sofa
Durmiendo to’ los dias para luego trabajar
Dios te bendiga, ma
Me fumo un blunt pa' recordar
Dicen que mi voz esta poniendo mal
Me pongo ronca, la nota comenzo a bajar
Vuelvo de nuevo a pensar
Y te pienso al otro lado de las rejas
Al otro lado del estado
Donde no es igual que aqui
Porque en Miami si te pescan
No facilmente te sueltan

[Hook]
Dices ser un gangsta
Tú no me impresiona
Dices que eres un gangsta
Pero no has visto na’
Lo hago todo sola
A mi no me ayuda nadie, nadie
Dices ser un gangsta
Tú no me impresiona
Dices que eres un gangsta
Pero no has visto na’
Lo hago todo sola
A mi no me ayuda nadie, nadie

[Verse 2]
Analizando esta situacion
Y son cuarto en una habitacion
Mi mami y papi tristes con la recesion
Ahora todo es bajo de presion
Pero canto esta cancion
Tomas pasion, un fracaso, una leccion
En mi manda el corazon
Yo sola pago esta sesion
En mi renta no hay perdon
Ni cuenta un patron
Ya van seis brindis que doy
Cuento cada bendicion

[Hook]
Dices ser un gangsta
Tú no me impresiona
Dices que eres un gangsta
Pero no has visto na’
Lo hago todo sola
A mi no me ayuda nadie, nadie
Dices ser un gangsta
Tú no me impresiona
Dices que eres un gangsta
Pero no has visto na’
Lo hago todo sola
A mi no me ayuda nadie, nadie

[Verse 3]
Arriba voy a llegar
Dime quien me va a parar
Cuando me quiso llamar
Yo no lo quise escuchar
Y el se enamoro de mi
Desde que me vio camino hacia mi
Yo no creo un hombres
Hambrientos hombres
Mi corazon no esta pa' pasar mas hambre
Ya borré tu nombre
Yo lo borré de mi, ya me olvidé de ti
Yo no confio en nadie
Porque justo cuando tu pensaste
Que tu tenias te olvidé
Y yo he hechado sola pa' lante
Y tu haz pagado tú estupidez
Porque justo cuando tú pensaste
Que tú me tenias te olvidé
Y yo he hachado sola pa’ lante
Sola…

[Outro]
Dices ser un gangsta
Tú no me impresiona
Dices que eres un gangsta
Pero no has visto na’[Intro]

Miami! Dade County! Let's ride!

[Verse 1]
I’m from Miami, bitch, yeah, that’s Miami streets
And all the haters want to push us, try to give us heat
Baby, we live in heat, so drop that shit and drop the beat
Let's party in my streets and leave the hotel room with dirty sheets
I’m no holds barred, baby, I’m gung ho
They sayin’, “Girl, you ain’t Jamaican, accent's got to go”
And I say, “Hell no, hell no”
I got Jamaica in my lungs, it’s that good hydro
I got that Barbee flow, I’m feelin’ irie
Party, work and chill on the beach all day
Got Corona in my hands, got that iron in my blood
Got my toes in the sand and my God is the Sun

[Hook] (x2)
I’m shakin’ up the game, trying to test my luck
Living life everyday by what comes up
Yeah, I’m working on some things, getting my weight up
I’m Helen Keller to the hate, I’m sayin’, “What?, what?, what?”

[Interlude]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh

[Verse 2]
We in that heat wave, where people ain’t phased
Workin’ to get paid, this town, they don’t play
The girlies like, “Yay”, they like the heart race
White girl on a white girl’s face, and oh-oh-oh
We do it for the thrills, thrills, thrills
We got enough bills, bills, bills
So keep poppin’ them pills, pills, pills
I’m chillin’ in my booth, feet up, V.I.P
Bring my girls to the damn party
Bro, don’t touch me, I got my own money
If you want a drink for free, show my girls your body

[Hook + Interlude]

[Verse 3]
My town likes to party all of the time
All of the time, take me down to Prime
Give me a steak, if it’s bloody, that’s fine
Got a roach in my pocket, took Mary J to dine
Let me clear my throat, uh (yeah, yeah)
Have mercy, babe, I hope you don’t mind, mind
I’m on a fucking boat, uh (yeah, yeah)
And I’m thirsty babe, pass me the champagne, pagne

[Hook][Verse 1]

I've gotta go, I've gotta run, I'm on my way
You tryna' stop me, now you got a thousand things to say
Well you got 5 minutes babe, I've gotta catch my train
And now you're on one knee, you pray, you pray that imma' wait

[Hook]

It's too late, I won't stay
It's always wam-bam, then a thank you ma'am
It ain't long till' you're back on your phone again

[Hook][x2]

I got another man, he loves to hold my hand
No he don't play no games, he don't play no pretend
He always puts me on my pedestal, that's where I stand
You look at me like i'm a vegetable, just cold and bland

[Verse 2]

Hes oh so warm, hes like the sun, and everyday
Ain't' even got ask just to know if he misses me
I say how you gonna show me love for eternity?
He says baby where there's a will, there's a way

[Hook 2]

It's too late, I won't stay
It's always wam-bam, then a thank you ma'am
Then you're back to your bad habits again!

[Hook][x2]

[Bridge]

He loves to kiss and tell me how I do it so well
Now you're ringing my bell you got your dreams up for sale
Oh baby, well I ain't' buying, Im tired of tryin'
Tryin' is tiring Under you's, not where I stand

[Hook][x2][End][Verse 1]
Time's been ticking, hearts are runnin'
Think that Cupid's up to somethin'
You asked me how I feel, I say nothin'
But lately color seems so bright
And the stars light up the night
My feet they feel so light
I'm ignoring all the signs
I keep on frontin', yeah I stay bluffin'
I keep you wonderin'
Keep you huntin' for my lovin'
But I crave us huggin'
Yeah I stay stubborn
Cause I can't admit that you got all the strings
And know just how to tug 'em

[Chorus]
I think I'm in love again
(My head, yeah you're in my head)
I think I'm in love again
(My head, yeah you're in my head)
I didn't think that it could be true
Let alone that it would be you
I think I'm in love again
(I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love)

[Verse 2]
My hearts' pacin', I'm confused, I'm dazin'
I saw something I never seen in you, it's got me shakin'
I must be haluscinatin'
I hear it happens, I'm just sayin'
Babe I'm just sayin'
Someone give me some paper
Someone give me some crayons
I'm feeling like a child, I need something to play on
I'm trying hard to trust you when you say "give me a hand"
Baby I'm fallin', I hope you catch me when I land

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
In my dreams you're the dutch and I'm the duchess
And your blunts are always loose so I'm in charge of rollin' dutches
And we getting so high, we always get the munchies
And we go for early brunches that turn into late lunches
And we ain't gotta label, we're just rollin' with the punches
I make fun of your belly and tell you do some crunches
And you say "yeah well your ass jiggles, go and do some lunges"
I say "fuck you" whlie I'm thinking of you as my husband
I think I'm in love

[Chorus][Verse 1]
I say it's just a fling
Don't go celebrating
He wants to make me better
He want to make me wetter
Baby it's just a fling
He wants to make me scream
He wants to make me do
Those things that I could never do
No I can't stick with you
Baby it's just a fling

[Chorus]
I climbed the mountain top
I conquered your hard rock
Your lava never stops
My lava never stops
I climbed the mountain top
I conquered your hard rock
Your lava never stops
My lava never stops

[Verse 2]
Oh here we go again
Remember baby, we're just friends
I'm falling off the bed and
You show me how to get up
Oh baby we're just friends
You show me now you're in
You show me how to drink you up like gin
Oh now I've made a mess
And I can't find my dress
Oh baby we're just friends

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]

[Chorus][Verse 1: Kat Dahlia]
I'm not gonna cry
No, not this time
These eyes won't stop my tears
They fight to stay inside
If I could just keep dancing
Drown out in this silence
And I can't hear my mind
When thoughts start magnifying
But I can't stop fighting
My hand, it gets so violent
Taped up, bruised and black
Like I did from your hands
Oh baby, oh baby, I'm crazy
I used to see right through you
I'm sipping, I'm drinking
I'm driving, it's crazy
Why can't my mind just lose you?
And no one knows what we've been through
I taught you everything I knew
I gave you everything I could
To show that you was never good
Stranger don't romance me
Cheaper words don't sound fancy
I'm too difficult to decipher
For you to ever break me

[Refrain: Kat Dahlia]
And you don't know me like he did
I'm sorry stranger, you should quit
I just ain't ready for this shit
I'm sorry stranger
I'm sorry stranger, you should quit

[Verse 2: Candy Warhol]
Yo, oh baby, yeah baby
Listen up, if love was a war
I strap up my artillery
Cause it's your heart that I'm fighting for
Just to explore, something special
I truly adore
Cause I wasn't sure what the future for us you had in store
So I step back, told myself to forget that
Feeling that I had when I met you
So my heart wouldn't set back
Now I'm stressed at
A point that I feel has no return
Delete your number from my cell
While I watch yo picture burn
And these thoughts just disappear
Cause me losing you, girl, is my biggest fear
I got big wounds, big cuts
A heart that'll never be stitched up
Cause a now a nigga broken
And my spirits aren't gone lift up
This permanent pain, emotion burning in flames
Along with that picture and the text
I'm making sure that nothing remains
And from here on out, without a doubt
Girl I will never be the same
Nah, I'll never be the same
Girl you know love is pain

[Refrain][Verse 1]
I wear my heart on my sleeve
Don't act like that's a disease
Need y'all to bear with me please
I just say what I see
We all just chasing a dream
In the land of the free
While we paying a fee
To stay on this concrete
Well, I don't know the price of your roof
But the first of the month we all pay our dues
When the rain falls it don't rain on a few
When the sun shine it don't shine just on you

[Bridge]
I don't know the monsters you knew
But I'm trying to forget the ones I met too
Baby you could help me
Baby I could help you

[Hook]
You look at me and you see what I see
Because your looking in the mirror
When your with me there's no use in hiding
Because you're looking in the mirror
Baby baby baby don't look away
Because you're looking in the mirror
Cause maybe maybe maybe we're just the same
Because you're looking in the mirror

[Verse 2]
We're all crossing paths
For a reason I know that
Hoping just to share some laughs
Avoid the broken glass
Have I met u in the past
In a life that I lived last
You know they go too fast
God knows they go to fast

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Outro]
Baby baby
Baby baby
It's the same pain
And when I wake
I hear the same wave
Of sirens coming down my way
And I'll never try to leave you
Baby your the one I cling to
Baby don't look away
Baby don't look away
I am you

[Hook]Yeah we on the rooftop

[Chorus]
My garden's wide of daisies
And it's untouched, come play
Check here, my rhythm baby
My sky's been looking grey
My garden's wide of daisies
And it's untouched of sin
My root's been craving lately
To soak in your diamonds
Take it, you want it
And I want you laying on me
My flower beds calling your name

[Bridge](x2)
I'll let your rain fall down if it sparkles like diamonds
Just let me wear the crown, my garden's appetizing

[Pre-Chorus](x2)

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

[Pre-Chorus](x2)

[Outro]
I'm singing woah, woah, yeah
Take it, you want it
And I want you laying on it
I'll have you
I'll have you screaming my name

?My GardenWell the concept of it is actually kinda sexual. It's about a women, who is inviting you into her garden and she is offering her vagina to seduce this man and for him to ultimately become her sugar daddy.Gangsta"Gangsta" was a record I wrote, at this point, three years ago and it was just  an autobiography of my life and it ended up becoming this kick off to...you know, where the rest of my career and artistic landscape was gonna to take me basically. "Gangsta was a song that I actually wrote in my first independent EP called "Shades of Gray" and it came out completely organically and it was actually a song that, if I had never written it and never came out of that project. None of this would of happened, my garden would have never existed so...it's really exciting.Crazy"Crazy" is a song that when I first heard it made me feel like it makes everyone else feel and that's why I'm so grateful for all the reaction that it gets. It's that you know...sometimes we do go crazy about people and we you know, we fall for someone really hard and we feel like we are insane and that's basically what the song is evoking and that's what I wanted to evoke in the video. Just all these different emotions that a girl is going through. When she's kinda feeling a certain type of way and she doesn't know how to handle her emotions.Saturday Sunday"Saturday Sunday" a record, it's almost like a turn up record disguised as this kinda like really robust and kinda sexy, mysterious song. But it's really talking about turning up on the weekends and then showing up to church the next day like "hey!"I Think I'm In Love"I Think I'm In Love" again is a record that actually came up from a conversation. Someone asks me "Hey, Kat, so what does a love song sound like from you?" and I was like, "I don't have no love songs" and then I was like "well, maybe I do, I have one." So I played it and it ended up getting this amazing reaction, so we decided to kinda revamp it, record it and put it on the album and now it's one of the favorites.Tumbao"Tumbao" is a record on the album that is in Spanish. It was inspired by Celia Cruz's "La Negra Tiene Tumbao" and I thought it was really important to put a Spanish record on the album just to give a shout-out to my Latinos out there.Mirror"Mirror" is a record on the album that we put out and it kinda just grew organically, on it's own and it ended up being something that so many people related to. It's just a song that talks about universal love and so many people have put out YouTube videos, covers, and songs and dances to it and it's a record that grew organically kinda like love grows organically and it felt like really important to have it on the album.Lava"Lava" was a really fun record to do. I did that one with Salaam Remi. We where just in the studio and there was really no pressure at all. We really weren't planning on...we just wanted to get the record done 'cause we just were tired and we wanted to go home. So I was like "yo, just let me go in the booth and I'm just gonna like, let's just finish this and put something down." It ended up, I don't know, I was reading a really intense book that week and really sexual book that week. The book was called "Sex and Punishment." Yeah the book was called "Sex and Punishment." It was like a, what was it called four-thousand years of judging desire and it talks about like basically the history of sex and women's suppression and homosexuality and all these things. So then, I don't know, I went into the booth and I just must've been feeling extra sexual and we finished the song in like thirty minutes.Walk On WaterSomebody had sent me that track, and only like a snippet of it and I didn't know where it came from. And they were like "yeah, I want you to get on this, you know I'm a be on the verses and you can be on the hook and da-da-da-da-da." And I listened to the track and I was like "oh my God, this is like amazing" and I was like "yo, let me keep this for myself" and they're like "nah, nah, nah, nah, this is for me!" I was like "alright" and then I went to the studio and I cut it anyways. So I wrote "Walk On Water" and I cut it and then I was trying to hit him up to ask him like "yo so, you know, where'd you get the track?" Just trying to be lowkey and he's like "nah, nah, nah, I'm not telling you." Come to find, that it turns out, that is was from the movie, Inception. So we ended up having to reproduce it and revamp it and just like redo the whole thing over, but it still sounds super-amazing. It's one of my favorites actually on the album. So yeah it had a long journey of deception and deceit and in so many ways, in more than one, but it made it to the otherside. Ching!Clocks"Clocks" is another record that I did with Salaam. Super fun. It was like right after New Years Eve and we basically wrote it - we were talking about right "when the clock strikes twelve" because that New Years Eve we were turnt up as ever. So we just wrote a song about the night.Just Another Dude"Just Another Dude" is a record on the album I wanted to keep completely acoustic. It's the only song on the album that's totally acoustic and I felt like it was important because so many songs on the album tend to be a little more produce. I felt like the way I cut it that day, I just went in the booth and I was just feeling a certain type of way and it was another song I just finished real quick and I wanted it to have that same emotion, that same vocal cut and I wanted it to have the guitars, you know, really, really stripped. Yeah it was important for me to have it on the album, to make sure that it was there and that it was received just the way that I heard it and the way that everybody experienced it, the moment that it happened, 'cause it was so, it was so in the moment. That whole thing. You know most of the whole song was done in like one or two takes, you know, just like run through. So I wanted to keep that emotion, like you felt like you were right there in the studio when it was happening.[Chorus]
Is it Saturday, Sunday, Saturday, Sunday?
Poppin' shots down the same lips that I pray
Saturday, Sunday, Saturday, Sunday
Maybe I'll get it right one day

[Verse 1]
Got my makeup on my face, who am I today?
Is today a new day?
Am I in a maze?
With my knees to the ground, head facing down to pray
While I'm a thousand miles away
No time or space

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh preacher, you're way too loud
My head's spinning 'round
Wash my gown
It's drenched in black, don't let me drown
Oh preacher, it's way too soon
Is it Saturday night or Sunday afternoon?
Who do I tell my stories too?
It's a DJ in the confession room

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Bodies all around, hypnotised by the sound that surrounds
Don't count me out, as the saviours been found
Spirits in my system, trying to resist 'em, no
They will not go, pour the wine slow

[Pre-Chorus]

[Bridge]
Say nothing I've been accused of my own use
I'm going, going, so it can cure my abuse
Say nothing I'll hold us in for my own use
I'm going, going, so it can cure my abuse, abuse

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Take my sorrow, sorrow away from me
Oh it's dark baby
Turn up the lights, turn up the lights
Oh it's dark baby
DJ turn up the lights, turn up the lights
I'm falling, falling, falling in my abuse
I'm falling, falling, falling, again, angel, angel
My feet hurt
I won't make it to the water
Oh preacher
