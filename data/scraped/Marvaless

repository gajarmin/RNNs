[Intro]
Nighttime shit, come on, Zigg Zagg

[Verse 1: Zigg Zagg]
Hit you with the flow of potential, I'm Killing ya
That's Zigg Zagg to the front & center
Clips/mags to the bitch that wanna sip on that shit
Scrape up the motherfucker that don't want to run with this shit
Look at the talented and while I'm chasing the streets, don't run with the gang
Break you off homie, Bust up faces for the sake of this name
From back in the day
Hit you with the Strafe like it's a straight flippin off with the mouthpiece
And big boys talking about that time they got paid
Three bitches; most of us think we need bitches too
I'm running the game solo with the (Icepicknicks?) and we be coming for you
Midnight
Speak that Venom, we speak that Venom so we roll through
Hit you with that flow that'll put you on stickmode, why? because of the (?)
Listen up when I tell you "Bitch Don't come at me Sideways"
We run looking at the Grand L'Arsenic (with full clips without a axe?)
Slipping up talking shit about me, Imma come stick one off in your ass
Make bitches know in broad daylight for the sake of this cash
Break you off homie, Bust up faces for the sake of this name (X2)

[Hook: Twisted Insane]
I am a Gremlin nigga, hit 'em all up with that venom shit (X4)

[Verse 2: Twisted Insane]
Murder in the darkness
Hit them all up with the venomous spit
Put them in the back of the Regal, and so many people wonder why I do this shit
I could have been hit, I could've been sent to confess the sins in the abyss
Maybe it's cause of these niggas
I got to be clipping these chicken I've wanted to get
Whatever the case Imma fill them with shit to the death
Until there's not even a breath in my chest
Don't believe me? I'm taking my vest
Because you never know when they're coming to test
Hoffing, I'm creeping, no sleeping, kidnap them and hit when you live on the West
Mouth into the river the blood and the count to 40 OZ holding my breath (ha!)
Now you meet the half of my wrath, my feet upon the gas
When I hit them with the venom, put the bodies over willing
Every nigga want to get them choppin up another killing
Motivated by the feeling
That I get from the flick and that fifty one fifty one fifty one off that Marley Green
You niggas my lights I get fading out, I'm tellin you people I'm higher than Charlie Sheen
Watch a nigga lean I move through the differings by murders took from the case
I've spent about four or five years telling motherfuckers to go out and shoot for the face
Two from the waist body hit the floor, before I hit him with three
Niggas be talkin like they are the sickest but really you niggas ain't fuckin' with me
I hit 'em with venom

[Bridge: Zigg Zagg]
Break you off homie, bust up faces for the sake of this name (X2)
[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Mind hella gone, I'm in the zone, stay blown cause it's drastic
I'm sacked for the elastic cats get laid out in caskets
Creep up on me like Freddy is deadly
You better be ready or probably to get the (fetti??), They knowing exactly how it's going
I'm no joke (??) come on thats all she wrote
Willing to do what it takes to get it You know I'm with it, count every digit
How about that? Make the semi clap, crack to really back, Imma show you how they react
Dreaming but never sleeping
But seeking to see the reason
Off in the evening busting cleaning
I been bitching to get it
Why they wish I been to did it
Snap back to reality no formalities call me queen like (??) Young Drow plus I'm just a one-pro here I come though
End of the snapper
Wake you up like "What'd you just call me?"
To the haters: Back up off me
You know I'm way deep in the scene
They don't wonder why I'm the West Coast Queen (Yeah)

[Bridge]
[Hook]
[Outro][Chorus by 151]
Westcoast trippin - trippin
Time keeps on slippin - slippin
Westcoast trippin - trippin
Time keeps on slippin

[Pizzo]
If you want some get some
Niggas down to kill
Westcoast trippin slip and get your cap peeled
On the real
We down to ride on bustas that be fake
We be strapped down like the old west
Crawl slow meet your fate
Fuck you and me and the .9 milli sick S
With soo much precision
Leave AWOL in your chest
Spelled with the ho's I left
All snitches put to rest
No problems to bring death
On any that try to test
So come get some

[Laroo]
?? from my angle
None of that playin that shit that you been hearin
We're gettin our papparaz on
Robbin 'em with the scarfs on
For the paper stand and stiff
They 'bout to the gift
Patna rappin to the clips
Gold knuckles to the dips
They're not fadin a operation
They already havin seal
Niggas try get deny
Later down no lyin kill
What you fear you can test
Recognize we're from the west
Bringin non-stop pain to your chest nigga

[Marvaless]
Gaffle your thoughts ? plots
Get you caught up with shots
It's all about whose trigger is bigger
Who's strapped and who's not
So if you want come , come get some
Bring the static we add it
Nowhere you can manage the damage I deliver
I figure that if you got enough heart
To bring the funk let it start
The boss bitch up in this rap shit
From day one you was done
Nigga it be me
They don't call me Marvaless for nothing
Westcoast representin
Disrespect we club the dub(W) in

[Chorus by 151]

[Pizzo]
Damn
Fairly even hit ya and we split ya
Did you even see it comin
Before you started runnin
Stunnin , amazin
When the guns blazin
Enemies start raisin off the turf
Cause we're known to bomb first
Layin in burst wet your T-shirt and get scurbed
That's how us niggas put in work
So if you want some get some
If not light and hit one
Heavy like 10 tons
Crazy on the gas when we've beamed one

[Lunasicc]
Want some get some
Better not take some
I doubt you lived that long
My niggas pack chrome tech .9's
Bustin while cuzzin lettin out frustration
Lookin for drive-byes rollin in a '65
Perry Mason dressed in all black
Ski masks down fuck probation
You disrespected
So I gives a damn about catchin cases
Rapin' niggas like bitches
Got 'em comin out clothes like ho's
Break up the chopper then popp him
Melt 'em down like gum

[Killa Tay]
Want some get some
Better not take some
Breaks 'em off properly
Feds still watchin me
Bitches still jockin me
Sceemin on my property
Like monopoly
Cause we're clockin Geez
Like a teller at the bank
Sprayin on the Tommy
Cause I'm smellin like the dank
Ho's tryin to talk bad
But I never sweat it
So shut your fuckin mouth and
Lets your name ??
Hard headed young bucks
Showin off they heat
But I got mine too
Always on the creep
AWOL'in for life
Callin shots in every hood
Got the white man hatin
Like my name was Tiger Woods
But it's all good

[Chorus]* Thug Thisle version has a re-mastered beat and shorter ending

[Killa Tay]
I'm mastermindin the plot, you ???? the spot
Wicked intentions, sensin friction, when the funk gon' pop
I tote my heat, and hold my ground
They know I clown
Pistol whippin and strippin em
Down to they riches, rapin they bitches
Nigga it's a, jack move, 187, count yo blessin
Hollow tips fire from all directions, leavin em wetted
Yo pieces deleted from existence, don't make no difference
I'm bangin like Metallica, serve any challenger
With a tre 8 caliber, fuckin em up like Algebra
From Cali to Florida, call the coroner
I'm missing in action, packin a full clip, for the bullshit
I told my nigga Lynch I got his back face
What's up now, ?????

[Brotha Lynch Hung]
Killa Tay, and I'm jackin the ditch
From the shit that get spit to take a lock on the dick
Like a red nosed pick nigga
I don't really give a shit about they life man
Off that night train
Cut they fuckin throat wit a knife man
And that's right man
Leave em layin in the cut
With they guts cut up what up
Put ya nuts up, on the shelf with no help
I'm so hell I'm so stealth, (I'm so, I'm so)
Nigga, Mr. know where to be contacted
Just bombsack it, tell my momma how I'm actin
When I'm packin I got my practice
In, I'm off that gin, losin wind(What you waitin for)
I'm waitin for the show to begin, half past ten thirty
Reverend like James, straight up strange
Shootin range, twenty four feet
Leave you off the earth with this heat
Leave you in the street, human meat
Believe me, I still be workin this like a thug(Like a thug)
Put you in the back of the Coupe DeVille
Take you to the alley, shoot to kill
Fuck that I gotta buck back(Nigga)
Fuck that(Nigga)
I ain't goin out like no zombie
Nigga smokin all that bomb weed
You possess and yes, I'm strapped like tombstone
Ready to pull out the Rafe, man, clackin wit Killa Tay
Lunasicc, Marvaless

[Chorus]
Like Jason, and CamCrystals with a pistol
Chainsaw and merchetti when the funk start, we ready
Like Jason and CamCrystals with a pistol
Chainsaw and merchetti, we serious about that fetti

[Marvaless]
Paper chase, but still credit to large accounts
Survive by the ounce all in the mix
Just as deep as it gets, ??? no counterfeits
Strictly bout my six, but don't ever doubt it
My niggas is bout it
For the love of the money and game
Shakin you niggas is funny
It's just somethin about, the way the game get spit
Cali niggas find a ??? in, for the scrilla strictly ballin
I figure a bitch nigga be the first to test
The first to get blessed
Not the one to stress I'm too complex
And my mind-state, no contest
Hot what I do so it takes a god to do what I must
Never had no trust
Cuz niggas will snitch
Go on some other shit real quick
Scholar, bout that dollar, make you holla, make you feel it
Drop wit Killa, we the realest
Cali niggas runnin the chain up

[Lunasicc]
Double C, the gangsta with the Glock in the cut
Identify the busta, aim first, then I bust
Creepin with the mask, blast on any nigga that move
Put my bitch in the back seat, cuz my AP need room
I got a real crew of niggas, ain't no punks in my squad
Bitch, to get away, drive, but don't leave till the bank get robbed
I wear Khaki Pants, Levi Jeans, and Hilfiger's
Puttin em on they back like they drunk off liquor
So throw them rags up
If niggas trippin, we catch em slippin, hold them 9's up
Blast on they ass, flash on they ass
Light my weed up, I like to get away high
On the cut postin like Pac
Niggas scream til I die, I'm no lie

[Chorus] - 2x[Verse 1]
Hit you with the flow of potential, I'm Killing ya
That's Zigg Zagg to the front and center
Clips/mags to the bitch that wanna sip on that shit let the hollow tip rip bitches to bits
Scrape up the motherfucker that don't want to run with this shit
Look at the talented and while I'm chasing the streets, don't run with the gang
Break you off homie, Bust up faces for the sake of this name
From back in the day
Hit you with the Strafe like it's a straight flippin off with the mouthpiece
And big boys talking about that time they got paid
Three bitches; most of us think we need bitches too
I'm running the game solo with the (Icepicknicks?) and we be coming for you
Midnight
Speak that Venom, we speak that Venom so we roll through
Hit you with that flow that'll put you on stickmode, why because of the deuce deuce

Slipping up talking shit about me, Imma come stick one off in your ass

Break you off homie, Bust up faces for the sake of this name (X2)

[Hook]
Hit ‘em up with the venom when I get up in 'em, I bend 'em and send 'em, I bend 'em (x4)

In my dreams I saw (Venom x4)

[Verse 2: Twisted Insane]
Waking up in the darkness, when I get the needs to murder, put a bullet in a pussy brain to pull up a mothafuckah rank
Jump on the shark with the blood on my face over the bid em care for a nigga hit the drain
Walking motherfucker gonna hit you with my thang

Never soon to dick for the motherfucking vain
Ima take you by the individual part of the game

Probably see the one of murder, me put it right through gets popin niggas they giving it up
Pardon a nigga walking to the top, drop all the way so i do want i wanna, put a nigga within the murder of the center but i do it when I'm picking a bone ya
Hit em, with the venom, when i better get up in em to ritual dinner sicking them all

Looks like cracking so many crickets was told by the pussy condition, i know the shit when i give you the sickest
Nigga anybody but her, someone in the back cuz i get on the nerves

[Hook]
Hit ‘em up with the venom when I get up in 'em, I bend 'em and send 'em, I bend 'em (x4)

[Verse 3]
Mind hella gone, I'm in the zone, stay blown cause it's drastic
I'm sacked for the elastic cats get laid out in caskets
Creep up on me like Freddy is deadly
You better be ready or probably to get the fetti They knowing exactly how it's going

Willing to do what it takes to get it You know I'm with it, count every digit
How about that? Make the semi clap, crack to really back, Imma show you how they react
Dreaming but never sleeping
But seeking to see the reason
Off in the evening busting cleaning

Why they wish I been to did it

End of the snapper
Wake you up like "What'd you just call me?"

In my dreams I saw (Venom x4)[Marvaless]
Yeah, ladies first so watch me set it off, even the brothers can't touch us
Professional Ballers is what they call us, ain't no tellin who we're bailin
Kentucky, Texas, ATL strikin in a Lexus
The nigga that wanna test this
Thought this shit was shut down, thought this shit was dead like Makaveli
Cali legends keep it goin, bout this player shit I'm knowin
Haters, I know you're bumpin this shit so here's another *?daltz?*
From the Bay to the SCC, you heard us straight from California's most

[Pizzo]
We don't need no practice, no theatrics
Bout the way we be livin with the Mafia tactics, I be constantly at it
Tryin to stack my riches like Bill Gates
Servin raw and uncut caine so you can't hate
Because it angers me when niggas try to bite my ass
But we be Professional Ballers hittin at the top-notch ass
Pass the green leaf on the left, inhale a breath of chronic smoke
Exhale like a pro, I be too much for you to cope

Chorus: C-Bo

We steady countin our money, on a mission to ball
All the things we dream we wanna see before we call
So we pack heavy, push Chevy's, makin the 'fetti
If you're ready to holler at a Professional Baller
*repeat*

[Mac Mall]
Baby Capone on the loose, skywalk and fly shit
Off Paraguay, Glock in the drop plus we're hidin
Astronauts, turnin in shit for the soldiers that recop
Shoot outta state pushin killer Cali rocks
Big wreckin ball nuts and you can notify the monks
I be flossin in gators, maybe ??? ???
Tennis shoes, press our shit
Aliens gank and flew, runnin out to see you
With the loot

Interlude: Killa Tay

Yeah
West Coast Mafia, bitch
Everybody else can suck a dick

[Killa Tay]
I'm steadily tryin to get my bail on
Tapped me up on the cell phone, it ain't far
Stomped in steel toes, I look out my ??? so back up off me
The K-I-double L-A T-A-Y, call me the locster
Only smokes the bombest chronic, Professional Ballers like the Sonics
Respect game, with or without these gold chains
We're sure the West got shit sold
From the rap game to the cocaine, come get some
Got pounds like a kick drum, got hitmen
Payin em under the table, lyrics fatal like a ninja
No pretendin, we're steady ballin

Chorus

[C-Bo]
From the Valley to the Bay, I'm known for stackin chips
My 500 whip be hip with the AMG hit
'74 drop Caprice, gold ones dip
Candy-coated sport, Professional Ballers don't trip
Makin moves, pushin luxuries to ol' schools
I spit the A-1, that's why my pockets weigh a tonne
And my crew be Mafioso's, high performance and low-lows
Professional Ballers on the go and get more doe

[JT Tha Bigga Figga]
Who keep it knockin with mean choppers? My niggas keep it poppin
We're rockin, Professional Ballers, Figga-Ro will be the tallest
Player that you spot, duck or dodge?
It's all, turn the Impalas all skirty
Left em deserted, heat em where their pockets hurted
Sold it up by then, two quarters and half a flynn
With my nigga Bo-Loc in the 500 Benz
Ready to bust and make it happen fo' sho', so stack G's
With them 8-ball gangstas
And the young mack knees and that's for sheez

Chorus{Killa Tay}
Murder mind like Manson, no expansion
Penitentiary chances cuz I'm scandalous, game deeper than Atlantic
Got em prayin like a mantis, but it ain't no hope though
Relentless bout this scrilla, these killas, we Mafioso
Regulate em like ho strolls, run em up off the Blocc
When the AK Poppin, I'm gone
Callin whoever I see, until I think I hear the cops comin
Mothafucka we run it, gotta punch it, got my blunt it
I'm sideways to the highway, can't be caught up in no punk shit
We run shit, from the West Coast, to the Midwest, to the South
Trigger happy like a B.G. put my streezy in yo mouth
Like toothpaste, kill em for actin two-faced
Backstabbin, they grabbin they pistols way too late
Murda 1 was the case
That they gave me, label me crazy, when we smash through
Wit a ???, leave em holy like a deacon leakin blood
Through yo teeth and meetin death, face to face, ain't no sunshine
Y'all heard the news through the grapevine
Gotta kill us all if y'all jealous G'z wanna take mine

Hook
We Blast! We killin em up, everyday, all day, we murder em up

{Marvaless}
Yeah my nigga, I heard you hollerin about you doin big shit
Fuck the complications, and fucked up situations
Bitch made nigga tactics, got these niggas wrapped up in plastic
Facin they maker, fed up wit the most unpredictable
Want it enough, well it's time that we challenge ???
So nigga what?  We in the cut, without no way to be seen
I'm blazin up, unzippin my come up, made the getaway clean
I'm fleeing the scene, and I ain't got it all anyway so let's choose
Should I think about ???? breakin yo ass, so what you gon lose
I gives a fuck about the next nigga survive ??????
Nowadays niggas is on other shit, so it's easy to plot
And I want it all, from the scrill to the bomb, to the stash in yo safe
You ain't even knowin what hit ya, you was flossin too much
Ya dividends must get touched, in all aspects I keep it real
Too much goin on in this killa field, so it's kill or be killed
Now who'd ya figure, was behind this trigga, bodyin ya cash
So I'mma smash for mine, and blast for mine
Without a trace, Murda was the case

{Killa Tay}
Murda, professional, untestable, so lethal with these weapons
Pickin em off like interceptions, causin havoc in seconds
I'm dumpin and punchin and leavin the po-po with no lead
I'm jackin and stackin and actin a fool, when it comes to my money and weed
They call me greedy like the Grinch, watch you flinch, soon as they see me
Post up wit Sicc in the cut, we hittin em up like graffiti
My money be funny, my bitches be vicious, I'm livin my life wit a grudge
Wit wicked intentions, I'm representin these G'z and these thugs
That ain't afraid to kill like Holyfield, I break em all off
No trippin cuz if the pistol ain't official I got the sawed-off
Crackin and packin, a marked-man like Sadaam, I do it my way
Runnin til my dyin day, I crush, pushin 100 on the highway
With no L's, watchin out for them jealous peepz
Gotta strap and a zip of hydro-weed but I don't need no felony
So I clear the house in 5th gear, thinkin about my young bitch
Ask these niggas who run shit
K-I-L-L-A-T-A-Y, all day nigga

We Blast! (Blast Blast!)  (Blast Blast!)(lunasicc)
I remember back in the days we used to live so right
Not word about a thang just ridin my bike
Clicked up with the homies at the school house ballin
After dark I hear my teacher at the front door callin
I ain't leavin til I hit this J sittin in my mouth
Walkin home hella high passed out on the couch
Those were the dayz dead now things did change
Takin dibs and yellin out young thugs names
Tappin phones tappin homes best watch yo back
Get gd up in your life stop worshipin scratch
Leave the dope game alone and find your way back home
Give love to the thugs that are passed and gone

(chorus)
Been so long I miss my homies
Been so long I really miss my homies
We keep eachother strong they never left me lonely
Been so long I really miss my homies

(killa tay)
There are so many homies to this game
But will it change got me goinin the same livin the range ????? the brain
Feelin the pain
Wonderin if ill ever see my G's again
Dependin on god to GLD when I need a friend
Resistin to take been on my own since my childhood
Pourin out some hennesse of memory of enale wood
Prayin for peace but still these streets gettin worse
We livin revalation so I'm headed back to church
Ajusted my mind remainded ricuse raisin my sons
Officially made no more stressin we infested in funds
Im still thuggin money can't change me
Still free until I'm six feet deep I rest in piece

(chorus)

(marvaless)
Rememberin some times
About the old school days
When we was rippin verses
Strictly for the love of the game
Talent shows were the thang
And all the sessions were packed
You had to raise out the stop if you were weak on the rap
Put the beat box in the back movin the crowd was the thing
Servin them all with the dream
No matter how bad it seemed
Kept our eyes on the prize
Always strivin for more
Raise up in the ghetto
Fast times strugglin, bubblin and losin
Half way we be choosin
Missin all my homies restin six feet
Always keep your name in the streets
Make sure they know how we did it
Until  we meet on the other side
Ride fo the cause and blaze one for you
Til we meet again stya up and tru

I could have been hit, I could've been sent to confess the sins in the abyss
Maybe it's cause of these niggas
I got to be clipping these chicken I've wanted to get

Until there's not even a breath in my chest
Don't believe me? I'm taking my vest
Because you never know when they're coming to test
Hoffing, I'm creeping, no sleeping, kidnap them and hit when you live on the West
Mouth into the river the blood and the count to 40 OZ holding my breath (ha!)
Now you meet the half of my wrath, my feet upon the gas
When I hit them with the venom, put the bodies over willing
Every nigga want to get them choppin up another killing
Motivated by the feeling
That I get from the flick and that fifty one fifty one fifty one off that Marley Green
You niggas my lights I get fading out, I'm tellin you people I'm higher than Charlie Sheen
Watch a nigga lean I move through the differings by murders took from the case
I've spent about four or five years telling motherfuckers to go out and shoot for the face
Two from the waist body hit the floor, before I hit him with three
Niggas be talkin like they are the sickest but really you niggas ain't fuckin' with me
I hit 'em with venom

I ain't leavin til I hit this J sittin in my mouth
Walkin home hella high passed out on the couch
Those were the dayz dead now things did change
Takin dibs and yellin out young thugs names
Tappin phones tappin homes best watch yo back
Get gd up in your life stop worshipin scratch
Leave the dope game alone and find your way back home
Give love to the thugs that are passed and gone

(chorus)
Been so long I miss my homies
Been so long I really miss my homies
We keep eachother strong they never left me lonely
Been so long I really miss my homies

(killa tay)
There are so many homies to this game
But will it change got me goinin the same livin the range ????? the brain
Feelin the pain
Wonderin if ill ever see my G's again
Dependin on god to GLD when I need a friend
Resistin to take been on my own since my childhood
Pourin out some hennesse of memory of enale wood
Prayin for peace but still these streets gettin worse
We livin revalation so I'm headed back to church
Ajusted my mind remainded ricuse raisin my sons
Officially made no more stressin we infested in funds
Im still thuggin money can't change me
Still free until I'm six feet deep I rest in piece

(chorus)

(marvaless)
Rememberin some times
About the old school days
When we was rippin verses
Strictly for the love of the game
Talent shows were the thang
And all the sessions were packed
You had to raise out the stop if you were weak on the rap
Put the beat box in the back movin the crowd was the thing
Servin them all with the dream
No matter how bad it seemed
Kept our eyes on the prize
Always strivin for more
Raise up in the ghetto
Fast times strugglin, bubblin and losin
Half way we be choosin
Missin all my homies restin six feet
Always keep your name in the streets
Make sure they know how we did it
Until  we meet on the other side
Ride fo the cause and blaze one for you
Til we meet again stya up and tru

(chorus){Killa Tay}
Murder mind like Manson, no expansion
Penitentiary chances cuz I'm scandalous, game deeper than Atlantic
Got em prayin like a mantis, but it ain't no hope though
Relentless bout this scrilla, these killas, we Mafioso
Regulate em like ho strolls, run em up off the Blocc
When the AK Poppin, I'm gone
Callin whoever I see, until I think I hear the cops comin
Mothafucka we run it, gotta punch it, got my blunt it
I'm sideways to the highway, can't be caught up in no punk shit
We run shit, from the West Coast, to the Midwest, to the South
Trigger happy like a B.G. put my streezy in yo mouth
Like toothpaste, kill em for actin two-faced
Backstabbin, they grabbin they pistols way too late
Murda 1 was the case
That they gave me, label me crazy, when we smash through
Wit a ???, leave em holy like a deacon leakin blood
Through yo teeth and meetin death, face to face, ain't no sunshine
Y'all heard the news through the grapevine
Gotta kill us all if y'all jealous G'z wanna take mine

{Marvaless}
Yeah my nigga, I heard you hollerin about you doin big shit
Fuck the complications, and fucked up situations
Bitch made nigga tactics, got these niggas wrapped up in plastic
Facin they maker, fed up wit the most unpredictable
Want it enough, well it's time that we challenge ???
So nigga what?  We in the cut, without no way to be seen
I'm blazin up, unzippin my come up, made the getaway clean
I'm fleeing the scene, and I ain't got it all anyway so let's choose
Should I think about ???? breakin yo ass, so what you gon lose
I gives a fuck about the next nigga survive ??????
Nowadays niggas is on other shit, so it's easy to plot
And I want it all, from the scrill to the bomb, to the stash in yo safe
You ain't even knowin what hit ya, you was flossin too much
Ya dividends must get touched, in all aspects I keep it real
Too much goin on in this killa field, so it's kill or be killed
Now who'd ya figure, was behind this trigga, bodyin ya cash
So I'mma smash for mine, and blast for mine
Without a trace, Murda was the case

{Killa Tay}
Murda, professional, untestable, so lethal with these weapons
Pickin em off like interceptions, causin havoc in seconds
I'm dumpin and punchin and leavin the po-po with no lead
I'm jackin and stackin and actin a fool, when it comes to my money and weed
They call me greedy like the Grinch, watch you flinch, soon as they see me
Post up wit Sicc in the cut, we hittin em up like graffiti
My money be funny, my bitches be vicious, I'm livin my life wit a grudge
Wit wicked intentions, I'm representin these G'z and these thugs
That ain't afraid to kill like Holyfield, I break em all off
No trippin cuz if the pistol ain't official I got the sawed-off
Crackin and packin, a marked-man like Sadaam, I do it my way
Runnin til my dyin day, I crush, pushin 100 on the highway
With no L's, watchin out for them jealous peepz
Gotta strap and a zip of hydro-weed but I don't need no felony
So I clear the house in 5th gear, thinkin about my young bitch
Ask these niggas who run shit
K-I-L-L-A-T-A-Y, all day nigga

Yeah, ladies first so watch me set it off, even the brothers can't touch us
Professional Ballers is what they call us, ain't no tellin who we're bailin
Kentucky, Texas, ATL strikin in a Lexus
The nigga that wanna test this
Thought this shit was shut down, thought this shit was dead like Makaveli
Cali legends keep it goin, bout this player shit I'm knowin
Haters, I know you're bumpin this shit so here's another *?daltz?*
From the Bay to the SCC, you heard us straight from California's most

[Pizzo]
We don't need no practice, no theatrics
Bout the way we be livin with the Mafia tactics, I be constantly at it
Tryin to stack my riches like Bill Gates
Servin raw and uncut caine so you can't hate
Because it angers me when niggas try to bite my ass
But we be Professional Ballers hittin at the top-notch ass
Pass the green leaf on the left, inhale a breath of chronic smoke
Exhale like a pro, I be too much for you to cope

Chorus: C-Bo

We steady countin our money, on a mission to ball
All the things we dream we wanna see before we call
So we pack heavy, push Chevy's, makin the 'fetti
If you're ready to holler at a Professional Baller
*repeat*

[Mac Mall]
Baby Capone on the loose, skywalk and fly shit
Off Paraguay, Glock in the drop plus we're hidin
Astronauts, turnin in shit for the soldiers that recop
Shoot outta state pushin killer Cali rocks
Big wreckin ball nuts and you can notify the monks
I be flossin in gators, maybe ??? ???
Tennis shoes, press our shit
Aliens gank and flew, runnin out to see you
With the loot

Interlude: Killa Tay

Yeah
West Coast Mafia, bitch
Everybody else can suck a dick

[Killa Tay]
I'm steadily tryin to get my bail on
Tapped me up on the cell phone, it ain't far
Stomped in steel toes, I look out my ??? so back up off me
The K-I-double L-A T-A-Y, call me the locster
Only smokes the bombest chronic, Professional Ballers like the Sonics
Respect game, with or without these gold chains
We're sure the West got shit sold
From the rap game to the cocaine, come get some
Got pounds like a kick drum, got hitmen
Payin em under the table, lyrics fatal like a ninja
No pretendin, we're steady ballin

Chorus

[C-Bo]
From the Valley to the Bay, I'm known for stackin chips
My 500 whip be hip with the AMG hit
'74 drop Caprice, gold ones dip
Candy-coated sport, Professional Ballers don't trip
Makin moves, pushin luxuries to ol' schools
I spit the A-1, that's why my pockets weigh a tonne
And my crew be Mafioso's, high performance and low-lows
Professional Ballers on the go and get more doe

[JT Tha Bigga Figga]
Who keep it knockin with mean choppers? My niggas keep it poppin
We're rockin, Professional Ballers, Figga-Ro will be the tallest
Player that you spot, duck or dodge?
It's all, turn the Impalas all skirty
Left em deserted, heat em where their pockets hurted
Sold it up by then, two quarters and half a flynn
With my nigga Bo-Loc in the 500 Benz
Ready to bust and make it happen fo' sho', so stack G's
With them 8-ball gangstas
And the young mack knees and that's for sheez

Chorus* Thug Thisle version has a re-mastered beat and shorter ending

[Killa Tay]
I'm mastermindin the plot, you ???? the spot
Wicked intentions, sensin friction, when the funk gon' pop
I tote my heat, and hold my ground
They know I clown
Pistol whippin and strippin em
Down to they riches, rapin they bitches
Nigga it's a, jack move, 187, count yo blessin
Hollow tips fire from all directions, leavin em wetted
Yo pieces deleted from existence, don't make no difference
I'm bangin like Metallica, serve any challenger
With a tre 8 caliber, fuckin em up like Algebra
From Cali to Florida, call the coroner
I'm missing in action, packin a full clip, for the bullshit
I told my nigga Lynch I got his back face
What's up now, ?????

[Brotha Lynch Hung]
Killa Tay, and I'm jackin the ditch
From the shit that get spit to take a lock on the dick
Like a red nosed pick nigga
I don't really give a shit about they life man
Off that night train
Cut they fuckin throat wit a knife man
And that's right man
Leave em layin in the cut
With they guts cut up what up
Put ya nuts up, on the shelf with no help
I'm so hell I'm so stealth, (I'm so, I'm so)
Nigga, Mr. know where to be contacted
Just bombsack it, tell my momma how I'm actin
When I'm packin I got my practice
In, I'm off that gin, losin wind(What you waitin for)
I'm waitin for the show to begin, half past ten thirty
Reverend like James, straight up strange
Shootin range, twenty four feet
Leave you off the earth with this heat
Leave you in the street, human meat
Believe me, I still be workin this like a thug(Like a thug)
Put you in the back of the Coupe DeVille
Take you to the alley, shoot to kill
Fuck that I gotta buck back(Nigga)
Fuck that(Nigga)
I ain't goin out like no zombie
Nigga smokin all that bomb weed
You possess and yes, I'm strapped like tombstone
Ready to pull out the Rafe, man, clackin wit Killa Tay
Lunasicc, Marvaless

[Chorus]
Like Jason, and CamCrystals with a pistol
Chainsaw and merchetti when the funk start, we ready
Like Jason and CamCrystals with a pistol
Chainsaw and merchetti, we serious about that fetti

[Marvaless]
Paper chase, but still credit to large accounts
Survive by the ounce all in the mix
Just as deep as it gets, ??? no counterfeits
Strictly bout my six, but don't ever doubt it
My niggas is bout it
For the love of the money and game
Shakin you niggas is funny
It's just somethin about, the way the game get spit
Cali niggas find a ??? in, for the scrilla strictly ballin
I figure a bitch nigga be the first to test
The first to get blessed
Not the one to stress I'm too complex
And my mind-state, no contest
Hot what I do so it takes a god to do what I must
Never had no trust
Cuz niggas will snitch
Go on some other shit real quick
Scholar, bout that dollar, make you holla, make you feel it
Drop wit Killa, we the realest
Cali niggas runnin the chain up

[Lunasicc]
Double C, the gangsta with the Glock in the cut
Identify the busta, aim first, then I bust
Creepin with the mask, blast on any nigga that move
Put my bitch in the back seat, cuz my AP need room
I got a real crew of niggas, ain't no punks in my squad
Bitch, to get away, drive, but don't leave till the bank get robbed
I wear Khaki Pants, Levi Jeans, and Hilfiger's
Puttin em on they back like they drunk off liquor
So throw them rags up
If niggas trippin, we catch em slippin, hold them 9's up
Blast on they ass, flash on they ass
Light my weed up, I like to get away high
On the cut postin like Pac
Niggas scream til I die, I'm no lie

[Chorus] - 2x(chorus)
California's the state, where punk niggas die
First thought be survival every mornin' when I rise
So many murders and homicides in front of my eyes
It's just some ballin'-ass niggas down to die for the West Side
California's the state, where all bustas die
First thought be survival every mornin' when I rise
So many murders and homicides in front of my eyes
It's just some ballin'-ass niggas down to die for the West Side

Verse 1:
(C-Bo)
It could be the napalm, droppin' non stop bombs
Armed like vietnam, dominatin' like King Kong
Lyrical madness, step up, take up, and start blastin'
Wicked as Stephen King when my mental and vocal clashes
Syrran wrap, like a boa constrictor, wrappin' ya
Up from your feet to your neck, nigga, attackin' ya
These 4-5 hollow tips will have you backin' up
I only do my dirt at night like dracula

Verse 2:
(Lunasice)
I'm wanted by the feds, these niggas, they want me dead
Cuz I done spread through their territory like the HIV
Sun down spots, suckas swallow Glocks
If they know by these rocks I'm pushin' for the blocks
Every corner you past, that show will run him up in his ass
Gettin' the cash, while Mr. Bad puts down the smash
I dumps quick, my clique be so thick
With hi-tech mob shit, crooked as Soviet

(chorus)

Verse 3:
(C-Bo)
The house on the water, independent shippin' quarters
Movin' tapes like K across every border
Takin' over your brain, causin' addiction like 'caine
More deadly than a grand shot of Heroine in the vein
Inflict pain, on any nigga that step in my range
Retalliate with hollow tips, blast, and splatter your brain
So remain calm, this shit is C-4 bomb
Set trip off your motherfuckin' city like 'Nam
Best recognize, step up and check eyes
Ain't to many busta-ass niggas from the West Side
I do or die for mine, livin' life like I'm blind
Solo on a flame line, dumpin' hollow tip 9's

Verse 4:
(Marvaless)
Survival first, ask questions later
Movin' patterns on your bitch-ass cuz I heard that you was a hater. Oh who
Can save ya?
Defeated your purpose, now you caught up in some deep shit
Who got the deepest murder clique, that's some would sick
This game is way past wicked. Still I commence to kick it
West side niggas stackin' meal tickets
Surpassin' weak bitches, evadin' snitches, and sayin' bomb
Killafornia style when we ride droppin' bombs

Verse 5:
(C-Bo)
Palay Palay, Tommy Hilfiger cold, can I?
Polo, Jabo, Guess, Khakis and Levis
Ballers is what they call us, too much for the ATL
Lexus, Benz, Beemer, Vet, VIP, 112
Might catch me at the Platinum, sippin' on some Hen, rolex down
Ride ST 400 Lex through the town
Clown, and you'll catch a hot metal tab up to the chest
Don't make me kill a nigga out east and head West Side
Till I die, reason why, I stay high
To maintain my composure and attitude when I ride
Don' push me, I'm too close to the edge
Might take one to the head

(chorus X2)

Verse 6:
(C-Bo)
It's the season of the sickness, marks on my shitlist
Comin' up out the psychadelic bui'ness, don't sit in it
When I gets to bustin', I let loose like a Mac-10
I'm born and raised a hustler, got love for my family, fuck friends
Never been disgusted, but I just like love it
Wit my streetsweeper, put hoes in your bucket
Man, I just say fuck it, I can't live with society
Now, how many niggas in yo clique wanna ride on me?

(chorus to end)[Verse 1]
Hit you with the flow of potential, I'm Killing ya
That's Zigg Zagg to the front and center
Clips/mags to the bitch that wanna sip on that shit let the hollow tip rip bitches to bits
Scrape up the motherfucker that don't want to run with this shit
Look at the talented and while I'm chasing the streets, don't run with the gang
Break you off homie, Bust up faces for the sake of this name
From back in the day
Hit you with the Strafe like it's a straight flippin off with the mouthpiece
And big boys talking about that time they got paid
Three bitches; most of us think we need bitches too
I'm running the game solo with the (Icepicknicks?) and we be coming for you
Midnight
Speak that Venom, we speak that Venom so we roll through
Hit you with that flow that'll put you on stickmode, why because of the deuce deuce
Listen up when I tell you "Bitch Don't come at me Sideways"
We run looking at the Grand L'Arsenic (with full clips without a axe?)
Slipping up talking shit about me, Imma come stick one off in your ass
Make bitches know break a bitch off in broad daylight for that cash
Break you off homie, Bust up faces for the sake of this name (X2)

[Hook]
Hit ‘em up with the venom when I get up in 'em, I bend 'em and send 'em, I bend 'em (x4)
On the wall I saw (Venom x4)
In my dreams I saw (Venom x4)

[Verse 2: Twisted Insane]
Waking up in the darkness, when I get the needs to murder, put a bullet in a pussy brain to pull up a mothafuckah rank
Jump on the shark with the blood on my face over the bid em care for a nigga hit the drain
Walking motherfucker gonna hit you with my thang
Get a little beneficial wanna hit em with the drain
Never soon to dick for the motherfucking vain
Ima take you by the individual part of the game
Open the body to i really wanna hit it taking the knife and the heart with the blood
Probably see the one of murder, me put it right through gets popin niggas they giving it up
Pardon a nigga walking to the top, drop all the way so i do want i wanna, put a nigga within the murder of the center but i do it when I'm picking a bone ya
Hit em, with the venom, when i better get up in em to ritual dinner sicking them all
You look in they motherfucking face i can tell they was telling a nigga to be selling them all
You hallow nigga mobbing how many years ago now
Looks like cracking so many crickets was told by the pussy condition, i know the shit when i give you the sickest
Nigga anybody but her, someone in the back cuz i get on the nerves
Come to my shows, tries miss, my shit but they can't get the words
Watch for the sweep fell of earth any pile core bitch would do me but night is coming you better get runing the jungle be struck by the light I'm domed

[Hook]
Hit ‘em up with the venom when I get up in 'em, I bend 'em and send 'em, I bend 'em (x4)
On the wall I saw (Venom x4)
In my dreams I saw (Venom x4)

[Verse 3]
Mind hella gone, I'm in the zone, stay blown cause it's drastic
I'm sacked for the elastic cats get laid out in caskets
Creep up on me like Freddy is deadly
You better be ready or probably to get the fetti They knowing exactly how it's going
I'm no joke like Bo Loke come on thats all she wrote
Willing to do what it takes to get it You know I'm with it, count every digit
How about that? Make the semi clap, crack to really back, Imma show you how they react
Dreaming but never sleeping
But seeking to see the reason
Off in the evening busting cleaning
I been bitching to get it
Why they wish I been to did it
Snap back to reality no formalities call me queen like (??) Young Dro plus I'm just a one-pro here I come though
End of the snapper
Wake you up like "What'd you just call me?"
To the haters: Back up off me
You know I'm way deep in the scene
They don't wonder why I'm the West Coast Queen (Yeah)

[Hook]
Hit ‘em up with the venom when I get up in 'em, I bend 'em and send 'em, I bend 'em (x4)
On the wall I saw (Venom x4)
In my dreams I saw (Venom x4)[Chorus by 151]
Westcoast trippin - trippin
Time keeps on slippin - slippin

Time keeps on slippin

[Pizzo]
If you want some get some

Westcoast trippin slip and get your cap peeled

We be strapped down like the old west
Crawl slow meet your fate
Fuck you and me and the .9 milli sick S
With soo much precision

Spelled with the ho's I left
All snitches put to rest
No problems to bring death
On any that try to test
So come get some

[Laroo]
?? from my angle
None of that playin that shit that you been hearin
We're gettin our papparaz on
Robbin 'em with the scarfs on
For the paper stand and stiff
They 'bout to the gift
Patna rappin to the clips
Gold knuckles to the dips
They're not fadin a operation
They already havin seal
Niggas try get deny
Later down no lyin kill
What you fear you can test
Recognize we're from the west
Bringin non-stop pain to your chest nigga

[Marvaless]
Gaffle your thoughts ? plots
Get you caught up with shots
It's all about whose trigger is bigger
Who's strapped and who's not
So if you want come , come get some
Bring the static we add it
Nowhere you can manage the damage I deliver
I figure that if you got enough heart
To bring the funk let it start
The boss bitch up in this rap shit
From day one you was done
Nigga it be me
They don't call me Marvaless for nothing
Westcoast representin
Disrespect we club the dub(W) in

[Chorus by 151]

[Pizzo]
Damn
Fairly even hit ya and we split ya
Did you even see it comin
Before you started runnin
Stunnin , amazin
When the guns blazin
Enemies start raisin off the turf
Cause we're known to bomb first
Layin in burst wet your T-shirt and get scurbed
That's how us niggas put in work
So if you want some get some
If not light and hit one
Heavy like 10 tons
Crazy on the gas when we've beamed one

[Lunasicc]
Want some get some
Better not take some
I doubt you lived that long
My niggas pack chrome tech .9's
Bustin while cuzzin lettin out frustration
Lookin for drive-byes rollin in a '65
Perry Mason dressed in all black
Ski masks down fuck probation
You disrespected
So I gives a damn about catchin cases
Rapin' niggas like bitches
Got 'em comin out clothes like ho's
Break up the chopper then popp him
Melt 'em down like gum

[Killa Tay]
Want some get some
Better not take some
Breaks 'em off properly
Feds still watchin me
Bitches still jockin me
Sceemin on my property
Like monopoly
Cause we're clockin Geez
Like a teller at the bank
Sprayin on the Tommy
Cause I'm smellin like the dank
Ho's tryin to talk bad
But I never sweat it
So shut your fuckin mouth and
Lets your name ??
Hard headed young bucks
Showin off they heat
But I got mine too
Always on the creep
AWOL'in for life
Callin shots in every hood
Got the white man hatin
Like my name was Tiger Woods
But it's all good

[Chorus]
