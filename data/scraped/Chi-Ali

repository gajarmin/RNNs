[Intro:]
Nigga, come off. Check this out. Check this out
Listen all this shit y'all talking ain't got no frills
We'll pass the 40 around and weill see who's got some skills, I mean
If you got 'em you got 'em and if you don't
(I got skins. I got skins.)
...you're over. So Mista Lawnge, listen, I give this brew to you
I'm gonna pour some out for my man pee-wee. (Pee-Wee!)
And do what you gotta do, all right black. Bust it

[Verse One : Mista Lawnge]
I'm the suger dick daddy
Fuck what you think
Pass the 40 right by me
Cause you know I don't drink
I remain sober when I drop a hit
But I put gum in my ass cause I like to pop shit
When it comes to pullin' gums I might do it
But put your guard up Black
And Ima run right through it
Don't sleep on the size
Thinkin' I'm easy to beat
Cause I'll be up in that ass like a bike seat
And when it comes to boneing I'm Mr Erecticy
Hoes come by the crib for a free histerectomy
I ive got a dick that I brag about
I put it in fast then I drag it out
Girls, I'll be the special friend see
Cause your man suffers from pseudo-penis envy
I do damage, Oh, Uhm
The Sugar Dick is guarantied to make you come
Now I pass the 40 cause you heard from me
So, go get a forklift Chi-Ali

[Verse Two : Chi-Ali]
Well I'm too young for 40's, and too young for blunts
The only thing I'm not too young for is the stunts
The girlies, the ladies, I love them with a passion
But back to the mic cause I'm always down for action
Many M.C.'s fall to the dust
Some will rust cause I bust and I crush
You can't touch
I'm the child of the wild, the flavor of the nile
I gave you plenty of chances still ya fuck with this style
Now that you know, Chi-Ali can't be tooken
Pass the 40 cause my mother's not looking

[Verse Three : Diggedy Dog?]
Yo give me that, kid. You pah will put you in the mourge
Listen to hot diggity dog
Bibb bow wow wow wow wow
Yipity yie yo, yipity yo yie yeah
Digity dog is rockint and
Yes, I'm definitly here to stay
Pass me 40. Pass me 40, pass it if you may
Because my jiumy is hard and yes I have a ho to slay
And when I'm funkint the bitches they go huhhhhhh
When I'm funkin' the bitches they go huhhhhhh
Youtall drink the 40, I drink a Guiness Staught
And when I see you home, I'm out-
Yo Baby Chris, pass me the keys to the car
I'm runnin late for my menage-a-trois

[Verse Four: Chris Lighty]
Pass it, tap it, and then crack it
Take a small swig
Or down it like a pig
You too tippys to operate this rig
I'm a mike, You suckers I strike in filght
Here's a DWI for drivin' drunk with the mike
From Chi to Lawnge and all those in this fight
Loosen your grip cause you're houlding it to tight
Itll take a body count, I know my body count is right
Five drunk niggers from my left to my right
And maybe a ho that I'm with tonight
But it's all right. Yo! It's all right
So Dave my grip is getting weak
Grab the 40 so I can hear you speak

[Verse Five : Dave Gossett]
I live large, caviar and limos
Spent most of my time refusing bullshit demos
Can you understand, do you you understand
Well let me explain I'm the A and R man
Dave Gossett. Yes I rock it
I rip the mike and I stuff pockets
Don't believe me, ask the Sheep see
They got the money, think it's funny
Always scooping all the honey
Opps. I ment to say hoes
Broke my own rhyme
What'ca didn't know, ut oh
I see a stroblelite ho, I gotta go, I gotta go
Yo Dres, it'syour turn
Act like gonnarhea and burn baby burn

V[erse Six: Dres]
Step into the booth
And give em proof
That Black Sheep don't need jack to get loose
And rip a roof, the center too
You're in my fuckin way so move
And let a nigga get smooth
Honeys play me close cause my goods are on display
So, I play em like vitamins and take a ho a day
I pull em like a dentist
MoId em like a teacher
Knock em like a bowler
Fleece em like a preacher
Step, get a man, go to school, join a band
It makes no difference whether
Dres is that type of brother
That will hit that ass forever
Cause I'm clever, ever
Never ever, hav i lost my sight
Or said might or went a boneless night
Not talkin bout chicken
But if she's finger lickin
I will let it be known
Don't bite the bone
Micraphones I like em cause they let me amplify
So don't reach for the sky, you know you can't fly
But still you reach up higher, a Black Sheep-type desire
Then you look up at me cause I'm a frequent flyer
So now you got beef chief
Grief will be your claim
I sport a full metal jacket
Give your beef some lo mein
Cause I'm swingin like a swinger
Singing like a singer
I'm lookin for your [fendahl]
Or your ho so did you bring her
Ah I'm just bullshittin
Almost time for quittin
There's money to be made
And booty to be hittin
Look and you will see
Dres that's who I be
A divine incline of mine is studio time[Hook: KRS-One sample]

Girls look soooo good, but their brain is not ready, I don't knoooow
I'd rather talk to a woman because her mind is so steady, so here we go
Girls look soooo good, but their brain is not ready, I don't knoooow
I'd rather talk to a woman because her mind is so steady, so here we go

[Verse 1: Chi-Ali]
Little girlie listen to me, stop giggling and kissing to me
Try to refrain from playing the childish games
And from your notebooks please erase my name
Kill the love letters, cause yo, you're living lame
I'm making records, my head didn't go swell
Chi-Ali is just too advanced for show and tell
Don't get offended, there's no need for insecurity
Age is but a number, it's all about maturity
So don't think I'm dissing, I'm educating
Until I think you're ready, I'm waiting
But now I reach ya like a book I must delve
Boyfriend after boyfriend and you're not even twelve
Bought your brush, you don't need to debate
Honey save yourself for Chi and I'll be worth that wait
Two or three years, don't be pressured by your peers
Surrender and you'd better be prepared to shed tears
Remember mom and the things you learned about
Cause I don't need a girl that's 14 and burnt out
Take my advice, think twice
In order to be with Chi-Ali you have to pay the price
Of being older, mature, a woman I'll endure
And if you try and diss me, I'll play you for sure
In four or five years or more
But for now, remember, that the

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chi-Ali]
Walking down the street and I saw this honey
She was dipped, the opposite of bummy
I stepped to her, I said "Yo you look swell"
Give me your number, you have a man, I won't tell
It really don't matter cause to me it means nothing
Next time I'm feeling rough, I'll just snuff him
Anyway, how old are you G?
"13", I'm Audi
The girl said, "Hold up, who you think you are?"
I said, "I'm Chi-Ali, a superstar"
She said, "I may be young but don't be mislead
With this dope body you'll choose me instead"
I said, "Don't get me wrong, your body may be ready
But come back in three years when your mind is more steady
I'm not trying to diss you, I'm just trying to blow up"
But do me a favor, hon, and grow up, cause the

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chi-Ali]
Downtown the Village, I see this fly cutie
Crazy thick, freshly dipped, with a fat doobie
I didn't waste time to kick my game
I stepped to her, I showed no shame
I said, "How you doing? My name's Chi-Ali"
She said, "Yeah, you're the one from TV"
I said, "Yeah forget that, give me your name and number"
She said, "Chill, maybe if I was younger"
I said, "How old are you?" She said, "17"
I said, "So what? I could get in between"
She asked my age, I said "Is that what you wonder?"
Don't sweat that G, cause age is just a number
It's all where your head is at, and I'm mature
Do I have money? Of course, I'm doing tours
So stay out of my pocket and everything will be splendid
I make my money, so I will spend it
Damn, I thought with you I could go steady
But now I see that your mind is not ready
Your body says "woman" one of the flyest in the world
But mentally, you're just a little girl

[Hook][Chi-Ali]
Once again
The Black Sheep are coming back at cha
And I am the fabulous Chi
And we gonna do it, uh
Some real freestyle stuff
For all the ladies and gents
So check it out, y'all
Kick it

[Dres]
It's time, time, time for the freaker
To kick it through your speaker
For the b-boys and jameekahs
Contrary to popular, Sheep won't play the pop
And, uh, if it comes to we, we won't tell it to stop
Cause see, that's what we do and I know for sure
That I'm a razor sharp-witted black entrepreneur
Me, y'all, nicer than your mother on your birthday
Getting mad attention like the planet does on Earth Day
Er-hm, speaking of which, ain't it a bitch of a lesson
When they say you'll miss your youth
Because I know you feel the stress when
Chaos, chaos, chaos! is the headline
That means we're near our deadline
So take your mind out of the fucking fed time
Listen to the brother Dres, I says if only our records sold in Brazil
Still, I sell all types of formats
A sound around that you heeded, when it's completed
You can't beat it, it's what you needed: hip-hop
Hip-hop, it's the cool type of sound that says the niggas won't stop
The noise, cause sometimes can spawn so much confusion
I wish my people had the heart to start a revolution
Instead of picking on lil' ol' we
Put your mind where your nine's at and shoot to be free
B, I'm like smooth soarer with the music out beyond me
And make moves with more strategal than the army

[Chorus: Dres (Chi-Ali)]
(Freak freak, y'all, and it don't stop)
It's Black Sheep on the street with sure shots
(Freak freak, y'all, and it don't quit)
We make moves to the grooves with smooth shit
(Freak freak, y'all, said it don't stop)
It's Black Sheep on the street with sure shots
(Freak freak, y'all, yo it's def sounds)
Black Sheep blowing up like a hooker laying down

[Dres]
I'm all about peace, peace, peace in this nation
But if she played me in the womb I give my mother complications
The nigga named Dres I raps like a gangsta bitch bandanna
Peep the grammar, I appeal like banana pudding
I couldn't come if I couldn't get it done
I might dine and dash, I don't rhyme and run
I make it better than mo', my style is wetter than hoes
Than blasting H2O in the Fifties on negroes
Still, brothers of today are out to get it done
Don't call us Bigger Thomas, we packs a bigger gun
The updated version of the Glamorous Life
Sees me, the Nineties negro that's got a black wife
Believe me, clenching on a bag and acting cheesy?
Me settle with Edith, I'd rather chill with Weezy
Check it, I wreck it like a drunk driving wino
On a barbecue I'm getting crazy light like an albino
So follow the ceiling to the floor of the Apollo
Now swallow, with Franklins I'm catching lightning in a bottle
A phenomenon, whenever bombing I'm causing hysteria
I pick up the mic like the stage was the baggage claim area
Ticket, I kick it wickedly, I be Tiki tocking
Clocking, ripping all around your block
You're jocking the brother named Tiki
Better be known I freak it every time I speak
On CD, vinyls, cassettes and, um, that's the technique
I use, choose your choice and check it
I rips it on record, I wreck it when I rip it
The Sheep will resurrect it for all neglected
We had to intervene, Black Sheep back on the scene

[Chorus]

[Dres]
I, I gotta work, y'all, gotta work real damn hard
Catch wreck and bust my ass so you won't pull my card
Still so many try, I have to wonder why they
Play with two fly brothers that they can't slay
I'm eager, anxious and I'm hungry to rip dubs like shrubs
Stressing every scrub in clubs across the country
Dres, I handle trauma like the plates in the vest
Drop a rhyme like a load shoots across a hooker's chest
Best believe I be no stranger to static
Word to Reby, my centipede be automatic
So don't do it cause, baby, hamburger won't help ya
If Dres gets ghetto-life like wool blankets found in a shelter
Where niggas hairy like Chuck Norris, I gargle with Lavoris
Make it clear on the chorus like I was Edgar Morris
Yeah, I stomp for reason not for feeling
Cause one man's flaws is another man's ceiling
Now when I was a child I did things as a child
But now that I'm a man I bust your ass and get wild
My style from jump, nowhere near fear
Yeah, y'all talked this to that, I held my head and persevered
Cause now the live wire empire expands
With grands of fans, Black Sheep by popular demand
So throw your hands in the air and let 'em free fall
And just freak freak, y'all

[Chi-Ali]
Freak freak, y'all[Intro]
Aw yeah, it's the Fabulous Chi-Ali coming at ya with something new
You know what I'm saying? We call this one "Funky Lemonade"

"Lemonade was a popular drink and it still is"

[Verse 1]
Get a taste of the lemon, lime a, rhymer, I'm the mack
A frack a lack, ripping tracks like a tractor
Rap reactor with more than a bionic
Man, I'm blowing up as if I was atomic
No gold on my caps when I rap or when I'm struttin
Cause you know, and I know, ain't no future in fronting
Or fakin when you're funking, flunkie you're flunking
Ring the alarm because you're bum like Jim Plunkett
I get top buck, buck, chill, I'm greater
I drop more flavor than the sun shines on the equator
And I squeeze, the lemon on this water flowing verse
So run and get your cup, cause I know you thirst

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I go splish, splash, I'm swimming
A lemon to a lime and I rhyme for the women
I blow like Hugo Boss, I'm frosty
My name's Chi-Ali, not Kriss, don't Kross me
Over, yes my head with airplay
No, cause if it ain't rough it ain't right, ask Cato
And the S to the H with A
Peace be on to the brothers in the O
Peachy is fat, run and tell your neighbor
I even got a taste test so you can taste the flavor
So get a zip, get a sip, get a guzzle
Simple, no fuzzle, props or a muzzle
And swallow Chi and follow, rocking the Apollo
Freaks follow D Demo back to the limo
So honey let me inject you with some liquid soul and
Oh um ooops sorry, real ho
Now money check your bunny cause honey be undressing me
With her eyes and I advise don't be stressing me
Stress I get enough, ain't that the truth
And some time to get ???
You need proof, get Brandy
I'm no Yankee but when I doodle hot dammit it's a dandy
A real Bronx Bomber
I run with the Legion and we blast with the Big Timer
No comma, or period, or exclamation point
My lemonade it's the joint, check it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Abracadabra, I flow like Niagara
Falls, I take none, you diss me, you got balls
But I got a ball for all of that, what are ya, dense?
Holy cow, another sucker clears the fence
Like Atilla, hon, it gets no iller
You're jocking, I'm locking shit up like Barney Miller
I got big bank, G, like hanky got panky
Pull dollar from Alfalfa, then spank Spanky
But don't thank me, that's the way I make a living, G
Because the pop life is not for me
So color me tic toc, I'm bad, I toc tic
Color me pig, pass the mic and I'll rock
Shiftiest, I'm about to mert squirt mert
Get over like a rat cause I'm fat like Levert
So when you're just coolin or foolin in the shade
Don't forget that FUNKY lemonade(Vanilli Shake)
I glide into this, clench fist don't miss
Sucks get dissed and scratched from my list
I break mic stands, raise hands for the next up
I pump ki's, Glock g's, so don't flex up
Just lend me your ear drum, so it can hear some
Shit rocked hard, unscarred, I don't fear none
Unperplexed, who's next in the spot light
Ya swing with this and prepare for a dog fight
Cause I raise knots, blood clots, like dreadlocks
Him and approve this, nah cause a fed not, top secret sucka
I think cause I planned this
Fierce attack, fast break like a mantis
Can this be madness
Has my mind snapped
No matter whoever moves gets popped a kap
Cause I make money and...
Take honeys and...
Let off more eggs than the Easter Bunny and...
As I drop a hit, you should just think and sit
Cause when it comes to flippin, I'm on some ol ill shit
Don't like to share, no next, just stare
No one can get a piece of this ill ass lion hare
The king of all cats
I swing mics, not bats
And never stick it in without the perfeclactict
Not to tax it, it means ill wax it
Slam it in my pocket, buy weed, don't try to knock it
So give me a break, not check 1 2 3
Vanilli Shake is thru
And here comes the Chi-Ali
(oh sucka, stay in ya place)

(Chi-Ali)
Chi-Ali is the name, just in case you don't know
You think ya heard it before
But can't remember shit from the prmo
A short brown brother, I dress real swell
Ya didn't hear me for awhile, so you thought I fell
Nah, I took a vacation, but know I'm back
To get my props, and dismiss those who lack
The skills it takes to be a microphone ripper
You may be dip, but I'm a tad bit dipper
You may be flip, but yo, I am the flipper
And if you think I'm lying
Ask your girl, I stripped her
Anyway, don't want to get too deep
Peace to the native tongue from the J.B.'s to the Black Sheep
And a special thanks to the founder of this
My manager and my partner Baby Chris
My crew in section 1, mu cousin Nonyay
I don't care how I look, I am not from Bombay
Nor Puerto Rico, Chi ain't short for chico
When fill a mill to throw on a hood ?????
Or a Malcolm X tape, when I'm out here I wear my cape
And all those who use to diss me, is catching the vaps


(Vanilli Shake)
Sifting thru the rubble, I discovered your bumps
Remains of your body, from the war with the tone
I trapped you like prey
And ate you alive
I am the champ and you take the dive
Cause it's you I defeated, our battle you lost
You wanted quick fame, and now you paying the cost
Because ah... ya got me started
I lost control, now Chi-Ali is my ?, and I own his soul
You coming here was a blunder, so now you wonder
Why'd you fuck with me, I bring noise like thunder
Rip like a page, you too young in age
The Shake is thru, so just take the stage
(ah ha yeah, I know won boy, yeah its phat, I know I won, know what I'm
Sayin, get on the mic Chi-Ali)

(Chi-Ali)
Listen up, I know you tired of the same ol flow
A crazy booty MC, wit a wack ass show
Who thinks hes all that, but his record make no sells
But I'll make you dancetill ya break ya fuckin toenails
I gethcha hype, cause my words is tough
And I even make a booty nigga wanna get rough
Not a slot when I'm lyrically about to drop
I grip the mic some ol other fuckin type shit might pop
Then go for mine, you ain't gettin a chance
One glance at my stance, will make you shit yo pants
So get new underwear, cause yours is muddy
Get free tampons, cause things gion get bloody
You wanna slam, I got some new shit that'll scoop ya
Even my old rhymes will knock you back to the future
Ya fast to claud ass, but ya too yella cut deep
Rhymin so booty, you start to look like a butt cheek
So I pull my mic out a gun holster
And make ya stomach wiggle like ya on a rollercoaster
Action packed like a total recall
I dropped that ass quick, you think ya ridin a freefall
So vacate, put away yo tape, call it quits
You coudn't out rap me if ya had nine lips
Cause my mic will excite, stimulate cause I'm greater
And even your girl can use it as a vibrator
Rap so rugged, I make a nigga act up
Gettin so hype, on a mic that it cracks up
The more I warm up, thoughts get drawn up
Then I communicate, and rappers get torn up
So yo when they ask, tell em Chi-Ali sent ya
Ya maybe good, but I'm a great adventure
(Know what I'm saying, kill it white trash)Verse 1: Chi-Ali

I be the Chi, oh who I be
No matter cause the serve say tre on a dime platter
Batter up batter boy, joy to the world
Get goosed by the Footloose crew and the youth
Back your brother Bam Bam, here comes the stool with more
What you hear will come clear
Fix up the mommy doo, jams that I adore
Making it clear to all ears
You wanna grab a yolk, don't choke on the young one
Come here I come, here I kiddy come come
Me not ??? yo ways in the days
That come, lay low, and then you get some
I'm around you on the neck for respect
You didn't want to cash in, so I'm mashin
Level from the low mumbo jumbo
They be splashing, and I be asking
Wanna swing a chop-shop rhyme by the pack?
That's a no no coyote, look how ya act
After I step on, you'll be stepping all in it
Cause I'm the roadrunner running things

Chorus: Dove

Cool it coyote, I'm the roadrunner running things (Repeat 4x)

Verse 2: Chi-Ali

So on after Jabberjaw and for sure
I rhymes any rhymes, I rhyme for sure
Pashes to bashes, bigger figure here
Ashes to ass, I trigger niggas here
Coyotes learn I burn every time
It's my turn, seems like a perfect
But is it worth it? Better be, better G
Than the next wrecks, or else I get vexed
No how did this adept kid turn rap?
All hips wanna flip when they check the stat
But 40 ain't the shorty to be guzzling with
I'm out to get paid so I sip lemonade
The ruffian youth with the pocket full of poof
So don't check the label, you're liable to goof
I work wonders, put a drumbeat to thunder
Rhyme like a rain, lay low and maintain
Break the batter boy with my rat-tat-tatta toy
Don't block the roadrunner boy, son enjoy
A talk from a New York brother in a swing
It's the roadrunner running things

Chorus

Verse 3: Chi-Ali

My problem coyote? I wrote this hit
This for the doggy doggy step right out
Don't flow the ritual puppy just sit
Soon comes a mini rhyme, in styles out
I funk the whole pile, wicked and wild
Must I profile? Well not by the mile
I got you nagging, bragging, that the Chi was raggin
But I grin and just smile
So listen real close, the brother might boast
Although I appear as the guest and the host
No need for all the lingering and loitering
When the roadrunner's running things

Chorus[Dres]
Yo! One for your mother, two for your pops
Three's for the niggas that's trying to kill the cops
So whether the Black Sheep are here, with the corner for the car
D-R-E-S so yes I guess it back and watch the Dres get raw
In transition, a pubic hair I can't stand
I tell your momma "I love you" if you thought my style was missing
My Snoopy, Droopy, Casper, a punky
You're rolling with Dres, the Black Sheep, that says my brother's freaking
Funky
I know you want to test me, but but but please don't try to sub me
Cause when but forever you get to snuff me
Beretta to your head and yo you'd better be on your jet ski
I could never be The Ruler but like Rick I say I'm slick
You're just a backwards kid, excuse me I meant to say a dik
So now you got beef and broccoli or is it cockolli?
But we got time, we keep 18, or yet two nines
So let the horns blow cause you know that you're just a barking dog
Bluff all along, prince now a frog
Don't play post, because we both know you're kellogs

[Dove]
I be the drama so watch the Wonderama
Catch a dips hips sweeter when I call her "mamacita"
Not a lover, a fighter, no need to loving these see
Didn't like the Brady Bunch, for many years I had a hunch
Living like the Givens, big thanks for big banks
I'm sticking like a dish swordfish when I shanks
Maximum is maximized, minimum is none
You want to shoot the breeze, please, pass the peas my pig is done
Not the vigilant, or walk with a slant
Want to hit the "Yes I Can Can" and never say I can't
I wear the Neil Diamonds and fucks what Simon says
Had to freaks the fat so I cuts some from my dread
But back, again they come, just a little sooner to
Become one nation under the groove
Oh I feel the Clinton, soothing me like Lipton
Tea, and it's definitely under the groove
I'm feeling kind of hot but like my man Rowdy Piper
Raining with the raps so hit the window wiper
Tired of y'all brothers going from a cipher
Don't baby sip the bottle or I hit you with the diaper
Never toke or smoke, I don't even own a lighter
If it's any pipe I'm lighting, it's the pipe that goes inside of her
Check the ??? boy as I ride or break time from the rhyme
Cause I'm back and out of sight of

[Fashion]
Snort up a kilo, better sex than Rio
Fashion, Ju, and Les, I make a third of the trio
Fiddly fi, fiddly fy, fiddly fo, fiddly fum
I smell props, hit 'em hard, and then I cum
Love to eat a skin, but first I inspect it
Not a crim-im-im-inal, got a record, go and check it
Or you can get ate up, pass me a plate of
A little seafood, I find a phone and ring a date up
So never start a track without Beatnuts on the list
Brothers buck shots from point blank and still miss
Middly miss, middly miss, why would I ever diss?
Fiddle or fight or peace and for for it fists
Ayo Huggy Bear, do your manager, do your damage
I'll let you tell the story but first get you a bandage
Cause you can go for MILES and MILES and MILES and
Talk more tracks than the dog doo doo piles and
Kennel, I say when'll, or when he stop
Let me see your girl and better believe those drawers will drop
It's getting freaky, a Beatnut thing that is
Let the horns blow because that's what time it is

[Phife]
Yo! Doggy doggy jivin', guess who's next?
The 5 foot assassin with the microphone check
I'm all that and more cause there never was comp
Play Mr. Bad and you shall get stomped
I had a head full of hair, but I kept all my rhymes
A brother from Queens and yo I always gets mines
No shorts are being taken, no not this year
The Phife Dawg is here so you'd better beware
Concieted? I guess it's something like that
Cause God don't make no jokes so I know I ain't wack
So relax and chill, sit your booty still
Or just take loss like the Buffalo Bills
But when I'm called the Phifer, how many times have you heard that?
Suckers walk around talking bout they can burn that
Soft MC, he can't be talking to me
Cause I'm far from a wuss and I never was a puss
I grab the mic, MC's start to get petrol
Cause there's no MC like Phife, like those who fight progresso
Open your back, not give you no slack, see what I'm saying son?
There more to this here than being short, dark, and handsome
Messing with my lady, you know that's a no-no
Why? Because you can't mess with my Yo-Yo
You know that I'm the one, you know that I'm the boss
I'm in there (Like the Dove?) No, like Franco ?Source?

[Chi-Ali]
Well it's me Chi-Ali and I'm the last to spark, yo
Everywhere I go I get stalked by NARC
And TNT just can't understand
You see a brother with gear, a beeper, and in his pocket a grand
But enough of that, let me break it down
We are all black brothers on a quest, yes we do have soul
Some of us are hoein', some are on the positive road
Me, I'm hoein', on the mic I'm flowing
With the tongue and we are positively growing
Now when I'm in a battle, I just be having fun
But competition be so scared that they be whitling come
Now ou heard me flow to a nice tempo so, let the horns blow[Hook: KRS-One sample]

Girls look soooo good, but their brain is not ready, I don't knoooow
I'd rather talk to a woman because her mind is so steady, so here we go
Girls look soooo good, but their brain is not ready, I don't knoooow
I'd rather talk to a woman because her mind is so steady, so here we go

[Verse 1: Chi-Ali]
Little girlie listen to me, stop giggling and kissing to me
Try to refrain from playing the childish games
And from your notebooks please erase my name
Kill the love letters, cause yo, you're living lame
I'm making records, my head didn't go swell
Chi-Ali is just too advanced for show and tell
Don't get offended, there's no need for insecurity
Age is but a number, it's all about maturity
So don't think I'm dissing, I'm educating
Until I think you're ready, I'm waiting
But now I reach ya like a book I must delve
Boyfriend after boyfriend and you're not even twelve
Bought your brush, you don't need to debate
Honey save yourself for Chi and I'll be worth that wait
Two or three years, don't be pressured by your peers
Surrender and you'd better be prepared to shed tears
Remember mom and the things you learned about
Cause I don't need a girl that's 14 and burnt out
Take my advice, think twice
In order to be with Chi-Ali you have to pay the price
Of being older, mature, a woman I'll endure
And if you try and diss me, I'll play you for sure
In four or five years or more
But for now, remember, that the

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chi-Ali]
Walking down the street and I saw this honey
She was dipped, the opposite of bummy
I stepped to her, I said "Yo you look swell"
Give me your number, you have a man, I won't tell
It really don't matter cause to me it means nothing
Next time I'm feeling rough, I'll just snuff him
Anyway, how old are you G?
"13", I'm Audi
The girl said, "Hold up, who you think you are?"
I said, "I'm Chi-Ali, a superstar"
She said, "I may be young but don't be mislead
With this dope body you'll choose me instead"
I said, "Don't get me wrong, your body may be ready
But come back in three years when your mind is more steady
I'm not trying to diss you, I'm just trying to blow up"
But do me a favor, hon, and grow up, cause the

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chi-Ali]
Downtown the Village, I see this fly cutie
Crazy thick, freshly dipped, with a fat doobie
I didn't waste time to kick my game
I stepped to her, I showed no shame
I said, "How you doing? My name's Chi-Ali"
She said, "Yeah, you're the one from TV"
I said, "Yeah forget that, give me your name and number"
She said, "Chill, maybe if I was younger"
I said, "How old are you?" She said, "17"
I said, "So what? I could get in between"
She asked my age, I said "Is that what you wonder?"
Don't sweat that G, cause age is just a number
It's all where your head is at, and I'm mature
Do I have money? Of course, I'm doing tours
So stay out of my pocket and everything will be splendid
I make my money, so I will spend it
Damn, I thought with you I could go steady
But now I see that your mind is not ready
Your body says "woman" one of the flyest in the world
But mentally, you're just a little girl

[Hook]A lot of speculation on the crime that I did
Dimes that I've slid
How a nigga been in the limes since a kid
When I was on the run all the time where I hid
What type of shit run through your mind on the bid?
Are you sorry for what you did? And jail was it lonely?
That’s a nice watch, what is that, a Rollie?
Are you still a parolie? I seen you with Joey
Crack in the video, is Fat Joe your homie?
Homie, slow down, I just came home
Can I get a minute, with my kids on my own?
Can I zone for a minute?
Dog, I just finished, doing 12 years surrounded by sergeants and lieutenants
Now I’m surrounded by frauds that’s in this bizness
That rap hard, but they soft and so timid
Lord, give me the strength to deal with this fake shit
Cause I’m just too real
So when a rapper says just call me, I do and he ignore me
After he show love as soon as he saw me
It annoys me, Mike said it’s common practice
He said the rap game is filled with a lot of actors
I’m used to deal with the fish you cats
They miss you calling, they hit you back
They say they gonna give you something
And they give you that
And if they not gonna do something, they tell you that
It’s so simple, but enough about that
Flex, tell Slay, ain't enough that I’m back
And the flow is intact, and I’m lookin like I’m 21
The bid’s over, so let’s let the money come
I could ask the questions, but I’m all about the dough
So the question I ask is, how bad you wanna know?

Blam, blam, blam, blam
A million, a million, a million
A million, a million, a million[Intro]
Aw yeah, it's the Fabulous Chi-Ali coming at ya with something new
You know what I'm saying? We call this one "Funky Lemonade"

"Lemonade was a popular drink and it still is"

[Verse 1]
Get a taste of the lemon, lime a, rhymer, I'm the mack
A frack a lack, ripping tracks like a tractor
Rap reactor with more than a bionic
Man, I'm blowing up as if I was atomic
No gold on my caps when I rap or when I'm struttin
Cause you know, and I know, ain't no future in fronting
Or fakin when you're funking, flunkie you're flunking
Ring the alarm because you're bum like Jim Plunkett
I get top buck, buck, chill, I'm greater
I drop more flavor than the sun shines on the equator
And I squeeze, the lemon on this water flowing verse
So run and get your cup, cause I know you thirst

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I go splish, splash, I'm swimming
A lemon to a lime and I rhyme for the women
I blow like Hugo Boss, I'm frosty
My name's Chi-Ali, not Kriss, don't Kross me
Over, yes my head with airplay
No, cause if it ain't rough it ain't right, ask Cato
And the S to the H with A
Peace be on to the brothers in the O
Peachy is fat, run and tell your neighbor
I even got a taste test so you can taste the flavor
So get a zip, get a sip, get a guzzle
Simple, no fuzzle, props or a muzzle
And swallow Chi and follow, rocking the Apollo
Freaks follow D Demo back to the limo
So honey let me inject you with some liquid soul and
Oh um ooops sorry, real ho
Now money check your bunny cause honey be undressing me
With her eyes and I advise don't be stressing me
Stress I get enough, ain't that the truth
And some time to get ???
You need proof, get Brandy
I'm no Yankee but when I doodle hot dammit it's a dandy
A real Bronx Bomber
I run with the Legion and we blast with the Big Timer
No comma, or period, or exclamation point
My lemonade it's the joint, check it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Abracadabra, I flow like Niagara
Falls, I take none, you diss me, you got balls
But I got a ball for all of that, what are ya, dense?
Holy cow, another sucker clears the fence
Like Atilla, hon, it gets no iller
You're jocking, I'm locking shit up like Barney Miller
I got big bank, G, like hanky got panky
Pull dollar from Alfalfa, then spank Spanky
But don't thank me, that's the way I make a living, G
Because the pop life is not for me
So color me tic toc, I'm bad, I toc tic
Color me pig, pass the mic and I'll rock
Shiftiest, I'm about to mert squirt mert
Get over like a rat cause I'm fat like Levert
So when you're just coolin or foolin in the shade
Don't forget that FUNKY lemonadeAw yeah, it's the Fabulous Chi-Ali coming at ya with something new
You know what I'm saying? We call this one "Funky Lemonade"

One time up for Chi-Ali
Cuz I could be in a box if I ain't see that screen
My mama prayed that I wouldn't be Chi-Ali
Now my mama straight cuz I wanted to be Chi-Ali
They say my Jansport strings was tying it all together
My Jansport strings was tying it all together
My Jansport strings was tying it all together
And now that new thing got me riding out for whatever

[Verse 1: Skyzoo]
One time up for Chi-Ali for coming home
Stargazing in the booth, my idol is on parole
Pay it forward when they see my lead to run along
Cause everyone who used to be by me is running blow
And they still rite next to me
Bet it how we get it, if I sketch it how they left it shit is still life weaponry
Pardon my advances, honor me by palming where your hands is
Corners gave us carpe diem answers
And I was by the light pole, Tre Styles caught up in a dice roll
Looping up "maniac pyscho"
Wonder the flow hyped me, nothing or no one like me
As much as I owe to Chi I feel like I owe Lighty
Money was everywhere, the liquor store was the anthem
Murder Chi wrote they went and hit him with cameras
Kings Plaza, talking "age is just a number"
Word to his infrared 6s on the cover mufucka

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chi-Ali]
One time up for Skyzoo
Got me feeling myself like it's a throwback from 9-2
Back from the dead like it's Easter and I'm Christ
And I'm, here for them checks like the sneakers and them Nikes
Got the penitentiary on my back, they all rooting for me
The whole Brooklyn Court, they all shooting for me
So lick a shot for Mumia in the struggle and
Middle finger to them C.O.'s in the bubble now
I done put my gun up, but that don't mean my run up
I'm just coming home so yo, now it's time to come up
And any nigga tryna stop that, just stop that
I'm on parole now, "yo chill Chi, I got that" (skyzoo)
Well get 'em son cause half these niggas don't even rhyme right
They all lemon, shut 'em down like the Limelight
In hindsight, wish I never pulled that trigger
Rest in peace Sean Po, you will always be my nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Skyzoo]
Begging my mother to take me to the record store
Cassette singles turned me to what y'all never was
Never knew that it would mean what forever does
But it's whatever cause to me it just let us run
I ran to it for the taking that it seemed
How the corner should've bagged me but maybe it was Chi
That was kinda like a reason why the pen started leaking
And now they call me top 10 speaking
To that I tell you all, one time up for Chi-Ali
Cause I could be in a box if I ain't see that screen
My mama prayed that I wouldn't be Chi-Ali
Now my mama straight cuz I wanted to be Chi-Ali
They say my Jansport strings was tying it all together
My Jansport strings was tying it all together
My Jansport strings was tying it all together
And now that new thing got me riding out for whatever[Dres]
Yo! One for your mother, two for your pops
Three's for the niggas that's trying to kill the cops
So whether the Black Sheep are here, with the corner for the car
D-R-E-S so yes I guess it back and watch the Dres get raw
In transition, a pubic hair I can't stand
I tell your momma "I love you" if you thought my style was missing
My Snoopy, Droopy, Casper, a punky
You're rolling with Dres, the Black Sheep, that says my brother's freaking
Funky
I know you want to test me, but but but please don't try to sub me
Cause when but forever you get to snuff me
Beretta to your head and yo you'd better be on your jet ski
I could never be The Ruler but like Rick I say I'm slick
You're just a backwards kid, excuse me I meant to say a dik
So now you got beef and broccoli or is it cockolli?
But we got time, we keep 18, or yet two nines
So let the horns blow cause you know that you're just a barking dog
Bluff all along, prince now a frog
Don't play post, because we both know you're kellogs

[Dove]
I be the drama so watch the Wonderama
Catch a dips hips sweeter when I call her "mamacita"
Not a lover, a fighter, no need to loving these see
Didn't like the Brady Bunch, for many years I had a hunch
Living like the Givens, big thanks for big banks
I'm sticking like a dish swordfish when I shanks
Maximum is maximized, minimum is none
You want to shoot the breeze, please, pass the peas my pig is done
Not the vigilant, or walk with a slant
Want to hit the "Yes I Can Can" and never say I can't
I wear the Neil Diamonds and fucks what Simon says
Had to freaks the fat so I cuts some from my dread
But back, again they come, just a little sooner to
Become one nation under the groove
Oh I feel the Clinton, soothing me like Lipton
Tea, and it's definitely under the groove
I'm feeling kind of hot but like my man Rowdy Piper
Raining with the raps so hit the window wiper
Tired of y'all brothers going from a cipher
Don't baby sip the bottle or I hit you with the diaper
Never toke or smoke, I don't even own a lighter
If it's any pipe I'm lighting, it's the pipe that goes inside of her
Check the ??? boy as I ride or break time from the rhyme
Cause I'm back and out of sight of

[Fashion]
Snort up a kilo, better sex than Rio
Fashion, Ju, and Les, I make a third of the trio
Fiddly fi, fiddly fy, fiddly fo, fiddly fum
I smell props, hit 'em hard, and then I cum
Love to eat a skin, but first I inspect it
Not a crim-im-im-inal, got a record, go and check it
Or you can get ate up, pass me a plate of
A little seafood, I find a phone and ring a date up
So never start a track without Beatnuts on the list
Brothers buck shots from point blank and still miss
Middly miss, middly miss, why would I ever diss?
Fiddle or fight or peace and for for it fists
Ayo Huggy Bear, do your manager, do your damage
I'll let you tell the story but first get you a bandage
Cause you can go for MILES and MILES and MILES and
Talk more tracks than the dog doo doo piles and
Kennel, I say when'll, or when he stop
Let me see your girl and better believe those drawers will drop
It's getting freaky, a Beatnut thing that is
Let the horns blow because that's what time it is

[Phife]
Yo! Doggy doggy jivin', guess who's next?
The 5 foot assassin with the microphone check
I'm all that and more cause there never was comp
Play Mr. Bad and you shall get stomped
I had a head full of hair, but I kept all my rhymes
A brother from Queens and yo I always gets mines
No shorts are being taken, no not this year
The Phife Dawg is here so you'd better beware
Concieted? I guess it's something like that
Cause God don't make no jokes so I know I ain't wack
So relax and chill, sit your booty still
Or just take loss like the Buffalo Bills
But when I'm called the Phifer, how many times have you heard that?
Suckers walk around talking bout they can burn that
Soft MC, he can't be talking to me
Cause I'm far from a wuss and I never was a puss
I grab the mic, MC's start to get petrol
Cause there's no MC like Phife, like those who fight progresso
Open your back, not give you no slack, see what I'm saying son?
There more to this here than being short, dark, and handsome
Messing with my lady, you know that's a no-no
Why? Because you can't mess with my Yo-Yo
You know that I'm the one, you know that I'm the boss
I'm in there (Like the Dove?) No, like Franco ?Source?

[Chi-Ali]
Well it's me Chi-Ali and I'm the last to spark, yo
Everywhere I go I get stalked by NARC
And TNT just can't understand
You see a brother with gear, a beeper, and in his pocket a grand
But enough of that, let me break it down
We are all black brothers on a quest, yes we do have soul
Some of us are hoein', some are on the positive road
Me, I'm hoein', on the mic I'm flowing
With the tongue and we are positively growing
Now when I'm in a battle, I just be having fun
But competition be so scared that they be whitling come
Now ou heard me flow to a nice tempo so, let the horns blow[Intro:]
Nigga, come off. Check this out. Check this out
Listen all this shit y'all talking ain't got no frills
We'll pass the 40 around and weill see who's got some skills, I mean
If you got 'em you got 'em and if you don't
(I got skins. I got skins.)
...you're over. So Mista Lawnge, listen, I give this brew to you
I'm gonna pour some out for my man pee-wee. (Pee-Wee!)
And do what you gotta do, all right black. Bust it

[Verse One : Mista Lawnge]
I'm the suger dick daddy
Fuck what you think
Pass the 40 right by me
Cause you know I don't drink
I remain sober when I drop a hit
But I put gum in my ass cause I like to pop shit
When it comes to pullin' gums I might do it
But put your guard up Black
And Ima run right through it
Don't sleep on the size
Thinkin' I'm easy to beat
Cause I'll be up in that ass like a bike seat
And when it comes to boneing I'm Mr Erecticy
Hoes come by the crib for a free histerectomy
I ive got a dick that I brag about
I put it in fast then I drag it out
Girls, I'll be the special friend see
Cause your man suffers from pseudo-penis envy
I do damage, Oh, Uhm
The Sugar Dick is guarantied to make you come
Now I pass the 40 cause you heard from me
So, go get a forklift Chi-Ali

[Verse Two : Chi-Ali]
Well I'm too young for 40's, and too young for blunts
The only thing I'm not too young for is the stunts
The girlies, the ladies, I love them with a passion
But back to the mic cause I'm always down for action
Many M.C.'s fall to the dust
Some will rust cause I bust and I crush
You can't touch
I'm the child of the wild, the flavor of the nile
I gave you plenty of chances still ya fuck with this style
Now that you know, Chi-Ali can't be tooken
Pass the 40 cause my mother's not looking

[Verse Three : Diggedy Dog?]
Yo give me that, kid. You pah will put you in the mourge
Listen to hot diggity dog
Bibb bow wow wow wow wow
Yipity yie yo, yipity yo yie yeah
Digity dog is rockint and
Yes, I'm definitly here to stay
Pass me 40. Pass me 40, pass it if you may
Because my jiumy is hard and yes I have a ho to slay
And when I'm funkint the bitches they go huhhhhhh
When I'm funkin' the bitches they go huhhhhhh
Youtall drink the 40, I drink a Guiness Staught
And when I see you home, I'm out-
Yo Baby Chris, pass me the keys to the car
I'm runnin late for my menage-a-trois

[Verse Four: Chris Lighty]
Pass it, tap it, and then crack it
Take a small swig
Or down it like a pig
You too tippys to operate this rig
I'm a mike, You suckers I strike in filght
Here's a DWI for drivin' drunk with the mike
From Chi to Lawnge and all those in this fight
Loosen your grip cause you're houlding it to tight
Itll take a body count, I know my body count is right
Five drunk niggers from my left to my right
And maybe a ho that I'm with tonight
But it's all right. Yo! It's all right
So Dave my grip is getting weak
Grab the 40 so I can hear you speak

[Verse Five : Dave Gossett]
I live large, caviar and limos
Spent most of my time refusing bullshit demos
Can you understand, do you you understand
Well let me explain I'm the A and R man
Dave Gossett. Yes I rock it
I rip the mike and I stuff pockets
Don't believe me, ask the Sheep see
They got the money, think it's funny
Always scooping all the honey
Opps. I ment to say hoes
Broke my own rhyme
What'ca didn't know, ut oh
I see a stroblelite ho, I gotta go, I gotta go
Yo Dres, it'syour turn
Act like gonnarhea and burn baby burn

V[erse Six: Dres]
Step into the booth
And give em proof
That Black Sheep don't need jack to get loose
And rip a roof, the center too
You're in my fuckin way so move
And let a nigga get smooth
Honeys play me close cause my goods are on display
So, I play em like vitamins and take a ho a day
I pull em like a dentist
MoId em like a teacher
Knock em like a bowler
Fleece em like a preacher
Step, get a man, go to school, join a band
It makes no difference whether
Dres is that type of brother
That will hit that ass forever
Cause I'm clever, ever
Never ever, hav i lost my sight
Or said might or went a boneless night
Not talkin bout chicken
But if she's finger lickin
I will let it be known
Don't bite the bone
Micraphones I like em cause they let me amplify
So don't reach for the sky, you know you can't fly
But still you reach up higher, a Black Sheep-type desire
Then you look up at me cause I'm a frequent flyer
So now you got beef chief
Grief will be your claim
I sport a full metal jacket
Give your beef some lo mein
Cause I'm swingin like a swinger
Singing like a singer
I'm lookin for your [fendahl]
Or your ho so did you bring her
Ah I'm just bullshittin
Almost time for quittin
There's money to be made
And booty to be hittin
Look and you will see
Dres that's who I be
A divine incline of mine is studio timeChi-Ali the lady stunner, I'm stunning the stunts
That's blowing me kisses because I'm a Native Tounger
The native runner, and I'm about to blaze this flock track
Like Isaac, I leave ya in the Hayes
For days and days and days you try and phase
Yet you need to get Met, cause yo I heard it pays
Your pockets looks skimp, but yo there's a bulge in my jeans
Cause I'm only 15 and ripping rap scenes
All the magazines say that cat's hitting
But I feel like a rat getting chased by all the kittens
And all the coytoes setting up traps
But collapse on the faaaaabulous
No haps I design, a lined on the boom blue batter
Up next, me context a hex, from the complex
Rough, stuff, I puff, smoke, you wanna toke slow poke?
Nope, you can't get nothing sporty
Your girl's naughty, talking bout "Who's shorty, who's shorty?"
But get your girl cause I don't wanna be the stunner
Just the runner, the funky Roadrunner

	Cool it coyote, I'm the roadrunner running things (Repeat 4x)

I shook up, honey ice tea
That's domino a girl, I'm an O and a fly MC
From the, from the west
I'm fly from the east, peace to both, we know who's best
Dip dip dip, I'm dipping landmines and pits
That coytoes set up to keep me from making hits
They want me to go pop but I'm a hip-hop the vote
So you know the only pop I'm popping is a soda
Never quote a Vanilla line when I wrote a
My mouth the trigger action and my brain's a speed loader
And yo my pockets stay loaded
(Hey Chi, I heard you blew up)  Pssssh, exploded
But now my Redhead, a Kingpin Ed said
"Move It" The kid got skills, don't belive me?
I'll prove it, to all, from Tony to T and
My vision's perfect, but if you smoke crack, I ain't trying to see ya
The only thing I smoke are my mics
So take a hike and uuhhhhh, don't sweat my Nikes
And don't be sleeping on my statute, it's no fact
I measure up to MC's because my mic's a protractor
And it may come as a shocker
I bumped around and got more styles than you'll find at Foot Locker
So cool it coyote, cool it coyote
Or I'll break a coyote, I hate a coyote
And if you're coyote, I won't hang with ya
Trying to trap off, or run off and bust a cap off, get the picture?
Hope so, cause I don't wanna be the dunna
Just the runner, the funky roadrunner

	Cool it coyote, I'm the roadrunner running things (Repeat 8x)

I'm about to be but, but before I do
I gotta say what's up to my crew
The Q, yeah, and on the check one, two
Is the Lemonader with Dres who said the choice is on you
So what's up Doc? Butcher for the cut
And can I get a nut (What?) Chill, a Beatnut
This combination you can't break, I'm hard to taste
So step to me and get cut up just like a steak
Yeah, I know that's from one of my promos
But my rhymes roll on more tracks than a fat set of ???
Total Wreck, Sean Cato got ill skills
The Op Shop cannt drop so yo just chills nills
Girls say I'm cute as a button
Fly denim, my raps' venom, I pin em
To, my trusty, my trusty old pad
No curses in these verses, respects due to mom and dad
Now tell me who's the #1 son of
Oh you guessed it, it's the funky roadrunner

	Cool it coyote, I'm the roadrunner running things (Repeat 8x)

	Can you make him run? Well let me him run! (Repeat 4x)(Vanilli Shake)
I glide into this, clench fist don't miss
Sucks get dissed and scratched from my list
I break mic stands, raise hands for the next up
I pump ki's, Glock g's, so don't flex up
Just lend me your ear drum, so it can hear some
Shit rocked hard, unscarred, I don't fear none
Unperplexed, who's next in the spot light
Ya swing with this and prepare for a dog fight
Cause I raise knots, blood clots, like dreadlocks
Him and approve this, nah cause a fed not, top secret sucka
I think cause I planned this
Fierce attack, fast break like a mantis
Can this be madness
Has my mind snapped
No matter whoever moves gets popped a kap
Cause I make money and...
Take honeys and...
Let off more eggs than the Easter Bunny and...
As I drop a hit, you should just think and sit
Cause when it comes to flippin, I'm on some ol ill shit
Don't like to share, no next, just stare
No one can get a piece of this ill ass lion hare
The king of all cats
I swing mics, not bats
And never stick it in without the perfeclactict
Not to tax it, it means ill wax it
Slam it in my pocket, buy weed, don't try to knock it
So give me a break, not check 1 2 3
Vanilli Shake is thru
And here comes the Chi-Ali
(oh sucka, stay in ya place)

(Chi-Ali)
Chi-Ali is the name, just in case you don't know
You think ya heard it before
But can't remember shit from the prmo
A short brown brother, I dress real swell
Ya didn't hear me for awhile, so you thought I fell
Nah, I took a vacation, but know I'm back
To get my props, and dismiss those who lack
The skills it takes to be a microphone ripper
You may be dip, but I'm a tad bit dipper
You may be flip, but yo, I am the flipper
And if you think I'm lying
Ask your girl, I stripped her
Anyway, don't want to get too deep
Peace to the native tongue from the J.B.'s to the Black Sheep
And a special thanks to the founder of this
My manager and my partner Baby Chris
My crew in section 1, mu cousin Nonyay
I don't care how I look, I am not from Bombay
Nor Puerto Rico, Chi ain't short for chico
When fill a mill to throw on a hood ?????
Or a Malcolm X tape, when I'm out here I wear my cape
And all those who use to diss me, is catching the vaps


(Vanilli Shake)
Sifting thru the rubble, I discovered your bumps
Remains of your body, from the war with the tone
I trapped you like prey
And ate you alive
I am the champ and you take the dive
Cause it's you I defeated, our battle you lost
You wanted quick fame, and now you paying the cost
Because ah... ya got me started
I lost control, now Chi-Ali is my ?, and I own his soul
You coming here was a blunder, so now you wonder
Why'd you fuck with me, I bring noise like thunder
Rip like a page, you too young in age
The Shake is thru, so just take the stage
(ah ha yeah, I know won boy, yeah its phat, I know I won, know what I'm
Sayin, get on the mic Chi-Ali)

(Chi-Ali)
Listen up, I know you tired of the same ol flow
A crazy booty MC, wit a wack ass show
Who thinks hes all that, but his record make no sells
But I'll make you dancetill ya break ya fuckin toenails
I gethcha hype, cause my words is tough
And I even make a booty nigga wanna get rough
Not a slot when I'm lyrically about to drop
I grip the mic some ol other fuckin type shit might pop
Then go for mine, you ain't gettin a chance
One glance at my stance, will make you shit yo pants
So get new underwear, cause yours is muddy
Get free tampons, cause things gion get bloody
You wanna slam, I got some new shit that'll scoop ya
Even my old rhymes will knock you back to the future
Ya fast to claud ass, but ya too yella cut deep
Rhymin so booty, you start to look like a butt cheek
So I pull my mic out a gun holster
And make ya stomach wiggle like ya on a rollercoaster
Action packed like a total recall
I dropped that ass quick, you think ya ridin a freefall
So vacate, put away yo tape, call it quits
You coudn't out rap me if ya had nine lips
Cause my mic will excite, stimulate cause I'm greater
And even your girl can use it as a vibrator
Rap so rugged, I make a nigga act up
Gettin so hype, on a mic that it cracks up
The more I warm up, thoughts get drawn up
Then I communicate, and rappers get torn up
So yo when they ask, tell em Chi-Ali sent ya
Ya maybe good, but I'm a great adventure
(Know what I'm saying, kill it white trash)[Chi-Ali]
Once again
The Black Sheep are coming back at cha
And I am the fabulous Chi
And we gonna do it, uh
Some real freestyle stuff
For all the ladies and gents
So check it out, y'all
Kick it

[Dres]
It's time, time, time for the freaker
To kick it through your speaker
For the b-boys and jameekahs
Contrary to popular, Sheep won't play the pop
And, uh, if it comes to we, we won't tell it to stop
Cause see, that's what we do and I know for sure
That I'm a razor sharp-witted black entrepreneur
Me, y'all, nicer than your mother on your birthday
Getting mad attention like the planet does on Earth Day
Er-hm, speaking of which, ain't it a bitch of a lesson
When they say you'll miss your youth
Because I know you feel the stress when
Chaos, chaos, chaos! is the headline
That means we're near our deadline
So take your mind out of the fucking fed time
Listen to the brother Dres, I says if only our records sold in Brazil
Still, I sell all types of formats
A sound around that you heeded, when it's completed
You can't beat it, it's what you needed: hip-hop
Hip-hop, it's the cool type of sound that says the niggas won't stop
The noise, cause sometimes can spawn so much confusion
I wish my people had the heart to start a revolution
Instead of picking on lil' ol' we
Put your mind where your nine's at and shoot to be free
B, I'm like smooth soarer with the music out beyond me
And make moves with more strategal than the army

[Chorus: Dres (Chi-Ali)]
(Freak freak, y'all, and it don't stop)
It's Black Sheep on the street with sure shots
(Freak freak, y'all, and it don't quit)
We make moves to the grooves with smooth shit
(Freak freak, y'all, said it don't stop)
It's Black Sheep on the street with sure shots
(Freak freak, y'all, yo it's def sounds)
Black Sheep blowing up like a hooker laying down

[Dres]
I'm all about peace, peace, peace in this nation
But if she played me in the womb I give my mother complications
The nigga named Dres I raps like a gangsta bitch bandanna
Peep the grammar, I appeal like banana pudding
I couldn't come if I couldn't get it done
I might dine and dash, I don't rhyme and run
I make it better than mo', my style is wetter than hoes
Than blasting H2O in the Fifties on negroes
Still, brothers of today are out to get it done
Don't call us Bigger Thomas, we packs a bigger gun
The updated version of the Glamorous Life
Sees me, the Nineties negro that's got a black wife
Believe me, clenching on a bag and acting cheesy?
Me settle with Edith, I'd rather chill with Weezy
Check it, I wreck it like a drunk driving wino
On a barbecue I'm getting crazy light like an albino
So follow the ceiling to the floor of the Apollo
Now swallow, with Franklins I'm catching lightning in a bottle
A phenomenon, whenever bombing I'm causing hysteria
I pick up the mic like the stage was the baggage claim area
Ticket, I kick it wickedly, I be Tiki tocking
Clocking, ripping all around your block
You're jocking the brother named Tiki
Better be known I freak it every time I speak
On CD, vinyls, cassettes and, um, that's the technique
I use, choose your choice and check it
I rips it on record, I wreck it when I rip it
The Sheep will resurrect it for all neglected
We had to intervene, Black Sheep back on the scene

[Chorus]

[Dres]
I, I gotta work, y'all, gotta work real damn hard
Catch wreck and bust my ass so you won't pull my card
Still so many try, I have to wonder why they
Play with two fly brothers that they can't slay
I'm eager, anxious and I'm hungry to rip dubs like shrubs
Stressing every scrub in clubs across the country
Dres, I handle trauma like the plates in the vest
Drop a rhyme like a load shoots across a hooker's chest
Best believe I be no stranger to static
Word to Reby, my centipede be automatic
So don't do it cause, baby, hamburger won't help ya
If Dres gets ghetto-life like wool blankets found in a shelter
Where niggas hairy like Chuck Norris, I gargle with Lavoris
Make it clear on the chorus like I was Edgar Morris
Yeah, I stomp for reason not for feeling
Cause one man's flaws is another man's ceiling
Now when I was a child I did things as a child
But now that I'm a man I bust your ass and get wild
My style from jump, nowhere near fear
Yeah, y'all talked this to that, I held my head and persevered
Cause now the live wire empire expands
With grands of fans, Black Sheep by popular demand
So throw your hands in the air and let 'em free fall
And just freak freak, y'all

[Chi-Ali]
Freak freak, y'allThis ain't a twinkle twinkle little star
But this may be the fattest track by far
And still the competition is, eager to listen
I keep shooting, recouping, and yo, forever missing
But I'm getting pissed off, they'd better break now
Cause me and the microphone is gonna shake down
And opposer of rhyme composer
Will forever grow and you know, you should have chose a
Different record, used a different method
It really doesn't matter cause I will still wreck it
I use my wits to outwit the other guy
Before he splits I give the vic another try
Rhymes are rabid like rabies when injected
He got hit with a skid and got infected
He was overconfident, and underbalanced
He tried to bully a brother and got silenced
A sudden outburst, the scene it got worse
I had to ostracize, him from the earth
Banish and exile the kid for a while
Throw him under my wing, and raise him like a child
But never lose stride, pace, or beat
Cause I'm built for the human race, plus I keep
Powerful punchlines, and when it's crunchtime
I still flow real suave, with a plush rhyme

I took a funky beat and I looped it (Looped it)
I took a funky beat and I looped it (Looped it)
I took a funky beat and I looped it
(But your budget it a million) Don't worry, I'll recoup it

And the end of a page, I just flip it
Cause it's 28 more lines for me to get wicked
So I continue to flow and blow MC's out the frame
At the end of the show, you know my name
Plus my trademark's left on the brain's base
An inprint the brother who sparked the place
Left the place in flames, scooped the dames
And what remains is a knucklehead skeleton frame
Chi-Ali the main event
Lyrics are bent and slammed to the pavement
A minute and 15 seconds gone
And the lyrical emporer is just getting warm

I took a funky beat and I looped it (Looped it)
I took a funky beat and I looped it (Looped it)
I took a funky beat and I looped it
(But your budget it a million) Don't worry, I'll recoup it

Still ripping parties with a passion
To move your rump is what brings the cash in
Hands are waving, suckers I hope are saving
All your yelling and swelling, and misbehaving
Head for shelter, but that won't help ya
Cause when I'm hot, I'm bound to melt the
Strongest uranium, and bust the cranium
Don't complain to me, complain to them
Cause soldier couselor, higher a bouncer
Whatever you do, it won't amount to
The force of swiftness, of strength and anger
Major wreckless, potential danger
(To Chi, why do brothers envy thee?)
Maybe because the rhymes flow indefinitely
(What'd you do, Chi?)

I took a funky beat and I looped it (Looped it)
I took a funky beat and I looped it (Looped it)
I took a funky beat and I looped it
(But your budget it a million) Don't worry, I'll recoup it (Repeat 2x)

(But your budget is a million) I told y'all not to worry

This goes out to my man Darren, sup man  (But your budget is a million)

Yo I'm telling y'all stop worrying, I'm
Piad, aiight, I'm blowing up y'all don't
Got to worry                             (But your budget is a million)

Yo, I'm not going to tell y'all no more
I'm outta here, aiight?                  (But your mother is a midget!)

Ayo, what's up with that?Verse 1: Chi-Ali

I be the Chi, oh who I be
No matter cause the serve say tre on a dime platter
Batter up batter boy, joy to the world
Get goosed by the Footloose crew and the youth
Back your brother Bam Bam, here comes the stool with more
What you hear will come clear
Fix up the mommy doo, jams that I adore
Making it clear to all ears
You wanna grab a yolk, don't choke on the young one
Come here I come, here I kiddy come come
Me not ??? yo ways in the days
That come, lay low, and then you get some
I'm around you on the neck for respect
You didn't want to cash in, so I'm mashin
Level from the low mumbo jumbo
They be splashing, and I be asking
Wanna swing a chop-shop rhyme by the pack?
That's a no no coyote, look how ya act
After I step on, you'll be stepping all in it
Cause I'm the roadrunner running things

Chorus: Dove

Cool it coyote, I'm the roadrunner running things (Repeat 4x)

Verse 2: Chi-Ali

So on after Jabberjaw and for sure
I rhymes any rhymes, I rhyme for sure
Pashes to bashes, bigger figure here
Ashes to ass, I trigger niggas here
Coyotes learn I burn every time
It's my turn, seems like a perfect
But is it worth it? Better be, better G
Than the next wrecks, or else I get vexed
No how did this adept kid turn rap?
All hips wanna flip when they check the stat
But 40 ain't the shorty to be guzzling with
I'm out to get paid so I sip lemonade
The ruffian youth with the pocket full of poof
So don't check the label, you're liable to goof
I work wonders, put a drumbeat to thunder
Rhyme like a rain, lay low and maintain
Break the batter boy with my rat-tat-tatta toy
Don't block the roadrunner boy, son enjoy
A talk from a New York brother in a swing
It's the roadrunner running things

Chorus

Verse 3: Chi-Ali

My problem coyote? I wrote this hit
This for the doggy doggy step right out
Don't flow the ritual puppy just sit
Soon comes a mini rhyme, in styles out
I funk the whole pile, wicked and wild
Must I profile? Well not by the mile
I got you nagging, bragging, that the Chi was raggin
But I grin and just smile
So listen real close, the brother might boast
Although I appear as the guest and the host
No need for all the lingering and loitering
When the roadrunner's running things

Chorus
