Get chopped up in game, niggas runnin my name
Master P up in chain, is he dead he's a man
But I be bustin, hustlin, niggas ain't trustin

No bitch or no nigga, ho or no sucka
Fiend or no clucker, but ready to hustle
With boulders, bigga than yo' shoulders
Runnin from the rollers, gone on that doja
Cause cowards despise, soldiers we ride
Killers with attitudes, but ready to die
Cause chickens get plucked, hoes get fucked
Turkeys get stuck, and niggas get cuffed
Ready for combat, my gat with my hard hat
Strapped with my crew and my niggas and all that

Chorus 1/2

Verse Four: Mia X

Hard times got my mind on cock, and massive thoughts be the plot
Top priorities the family dope and royalty
My loyalty, fiends with a gang of true niggas
No colors, just a bunch of ignorant motherfuckers
Trust my pen is an infa-red
Hollow-tips be my lyrics dipped in venom when I send em
They split ya head (pssssh) wide open
My rhymes on fire blood, but you can't smoke ne'er a one
Don't try to come, don't even touch the mic
My shit so tight, it's more correct than right, when I recite
Absolutely, you booty-ass hoes and niggas
Perpetratin behind water gun triggers
Hurry up and figure out that studio Gotti's catch hotties to the mouth
Who got that clout, don't act surprised cause it's that bitch from the South
Mia X hoes, you don't want no problems
Get so much respect, even yo' niggas call me momma, the biggest one
To come stompin out the N.O., the crescent
Testin, chin-checkin, wreckin when I'm flexin on your WHOLE crew
Who wants to go to war with this lyrical arsenist
Ya talkin shit, I'll having ya runnin for the thesaurus, cause I'm walkin wit
The big dogs without hesitation, Unlady Like as ever
Full of, verbal annhilation
Escaping, po-po's chasin, want ta catch me but they cain't
I made em think, and now they too scared to run up on the tank
No Limit, you can start it, but we niggas is the hardest
To deal wit, keeps the steel, and the plastics to peel wit
In reach, so we can touch yo' ass
And leave a bout it scarf on ya face, we soldiers

Chorus 3/4

TRU niggas wave ya guns, show ya tattoos

Jumpin off the tank

And you can't keep runnin in and out of my life
Whatcha Wanna Do?
And you better change your ways and start treatin me right
(3x)

Verse 1:  Mia X
I tried to feed you everything you needed
And if I wrote I love you in the sky, you probably wouldn't read it
Cause, you actin like it don't even matter no more
Sometimes, I feel we in a race, tryin to make it to the door
Is it that I bore you, is it someone else again?
Should we put this to an end, and maybe start again as friends
I'm tryin to be mature, but mentally, I'm so tired
And you can't even tell me why
I cry feelin stupid, used and alone
When it's four in the mornin and you still not home
Where did we go wrong, it used to be all gravy
Makin love all night, callin me your baby
But things got shady, now we ain't even close
Treat me like I should leave, and then don't want me to go
Sometimes I think I'm stuck, ?some say we goin on that path?
And then you raise me on the phone and please let you come back
Whatcha Wanna Do?

Chorus:  Charlie Wilson
Cause my heart is yearnin for your love
(2x)

Verse 2:  Mia X
Now we been through all kinds of drama
But I'm the only other woman who loves you just as much as mama
I'm tryin to hold on, cause what we had was so deep
And in relationships, you got to take the bitter with the sweet
You keep runnin in and out, messin with my feelings
Playin with my mind and I know you see me trying
But even soldiers fall, remember when you fell
Remember the excuses and the lies I had to tell
?Put penance? for your bail, even though you gave me hell
When you was snortin more than half of what you had to sell
Put up with all your flings, hold my head, feelin sad
But through all the bull, you know it wasn't that bad
You used to make me laugh, show me love and respect
But if you don't make a change, you'll be callin me your ex
Can't keep runnin in and out
Can't keep runnin
Whatcha Wanna Do?
Whatcha Wanna Do?

Chorus

Cause my heart is yearnin for your, let me inside your love
My heart is yearnin for your, let me inside your love
Whatcha Wanna Do?

Outro:  Mia X(Charlie Wilson)
Now what we gonna do?
I can't help but think of all the good times we had
When everything was so right
You know I can't pull all the weight by myself
And I feel like that's what I've been doin lately
It's a 50/50 love in a relationship, remember that
Now you runnin wild out here(Mama Mia, not gonna let you go baby)
Gamblin with all this foolishness in the streets
Whatcha gon cry about? (Mama Mia, not gonna let you go no)
You know what me and you had was real
Why you tryin to let it go?
If you wanna let it go, that's cool too(Mama Mia, not gonna let you go
Baby)
Cause I'm lookin for a Mr. DoRight
I was hopin it was you(Mama Mia, not gonna let you go no)
Cause when I first met you, that's what you was to me
Now Whatcha Wanna Do? (Mama Mia, not gonna let you go baby)
I ain't gonna keep askin you(Mama Mia, not gonna let you go no)
You already have two strikes

BOUT IT (bout it bout it)[Intro]
I came here tonight to settle the score
Females are women and girls, not bitches and hoes
To all the niggas that's stunting off the weak-ass rhymes
It's payback time

[Verse 1]
So what up, get up, boot up, c'mon
What up, get up, boot up, c'mon
What up, get up
Lick up, suck up, get up, pay up
Get up, what up, what up, what up

Niggas all around that's dissing the women
I came to get you straight cause I mean it yes to win it
I tried to let you slide, but now I'm getting pissed
Mia X is in effect so don't be starting no shit
Now, "Suck a nigga dick for an outfit"?
And, "Suck a nigga dick for some K-Swiss"?
Well, eat a lady's pussy for a home-cooked meal
And blow the ass for a 40, bitch
Lying on your dick non-stop
That's something that a woman just crams to understand
You ain't seen no guts, don't get no guts
The closest thing to some pussy is your hand
"Biggity-bounce, baby, bounce"? Bitch, I ain't no ball
You get excited if I ride it, but your dick too small
Doing damage to my backbone? Please!
You're barely tickling the walls -- bitch, you're just a tease
And make my pussy scream for a six-inch dick?
I'm pushing eight-pound babies, so you talking shit
Ride that dick with a boot in my mouth?
You get the gat for the cat cause I wear your ass out
Leave your mind without a clue, thoughts without a trace
Just waiting for a turn for the pussy in your face
You said the pussy wasn't nothing but meat on the bone
Til you took a little stroll in a comfort zone

Nigga, stop talking that shit
You can't wear a pussy out with that weak-ass dick
I say nigga, stop talking that shit
You can't wear a pussy out with that weak-ass dick
Now why your dick so small?
Cause your nuts look like chiny balls, bitch
Now why your dick so small?
Cause your nuts look like chiny balls
Well, I didn't get no nut, nigga
So you can't get your fucking hair cut, nigga
I say, I didn't get no nut
So you can't get your fucking hair cut

[Verse 2]
I met this nigga, his name was Duke
The bitch tried to take me to the Rochambeau
I said, "Cheap motherfucker, better come again
And let's mosey on over to La Quinta Inn"
When we got in the room, he started to stunt
He said, "I'ma bring the noise to your little cunt"
So when he pulled down his pants and introduced me to cat
All I could say is, "Where it's at, where it's at"
The dick was small, he had no balls
I said, "You ain't doing damage, no damage at all
Lay back and let me do that right"
I made him shake, shiver, scream, wiggle, moan, and cry
You know, the nigga couldn't hang like I already knew
Made him pay me three bills, took the car keys too
Pulled up and blowed for Bunny and Mice
Rolled through the Calliope, wasn't nothing nice
A nigga said he was starving, needed his hair cut
Well, get on your knees and lick this butt
Hardcore is what I am, coming at you correct
Cause niggas ain't worth the blood on your Kotex

Oops oops, got some hair in your teeth, bitch
You graduated from tits and now you're sucking clits
Oops oops, got some hair in your teeth, bitch
You graduated from tits and now you're sucking clits
Shake for the Third Ward, shake for the Fourth Ward
Shake and take his money
I said, shake for the Sixth Ward, shake for the Seventh Ward
Make him lick that honey
Shake for the Eighth Ward, shake for the Ninth Ward
Shake it girl, shake shake shake
Or just shake for the Tenth Ward, shake for the Twelfth
Let them put the dick it's in an earthquake
Shake for Hollygrove, shake for the West Bank
Shake for the projects too
Hop for your neighborhood, hop for New Orleans
Know the rough hunting niggas, this for you

[Verse 3]
I ain't popping for no stunters, I use my head
And pop this pussy for a mink instead
I don't want no Shoney's or Denny's
But we could wine and dine at Copeland's, please
I don't need four golds in my mouth
But you can put Louis the Fourteenth in my house
I want a herringbone set and I want a purse
Bitch, I want to do me in verse
Met another nigga but he didn't like rubbers
(What?!) So he couldn't be my lover
Practice safe sex and keep the coochie clean
Because a nigga might turn your shits purple and green
And all you niggas out there claiming you don't eat
Everybody knows that that's a L-I-E
But since your ass do lie, I wish your nose did grow
Cause it would please me much better than what you got below
So where they at, get the gat and bounce baby to this
Uh, real woman shit
Niggety-niggety-nigga, I need some gear
So hustle that money and bring it here
And niggety-niggety-nigga, you better move fast
Bring me that Explorer filled up with gas
And make sure it's clean when I rep
So don't give me no-no-no don't give me carpet no sack(?)
And if I meet another nigga bumping in his shit
The pussy-ass nigga gotta deal with it

Cause ain't no nigga like a trick daddy nigga
Cause a tight motherfucker ain't shit
So if you squeak when you walk, you ain't legit
And you better just get on, bitch
All the ladies say, ain't no nigga like a trick daddy nigga
Cause a tight motherfucker ain't shit
So if you squeak when you walk, you ain't legit
And you better just get on, bitch

Now, this young nigga, he had a Benz
He had a pocket full of ends
So I pussy-whipped that ding-a-ling-ding
Cause I'mma get paid for doing my thing
Call me a bitch, or even a slut
But nigga, you know you paid for the guts
So talk that shit with your fake punk ass
But don't forget to tell them how you tricked that cash

What up, get up, boot up, c'mon
What up, get up, boot up, c'mon
What up, get up
Lick up, suck up, get up, pay up
Get up, trick up, what up, get up, what up

[Verse 4]
The Uptown women, they hauling fast
And quick to knock a motherfucker on his ass
The Downtown women got poison taste
You could smell our perfume when we walk in the place
Sassy and classy, but don't forget
With the blink of a eye, we'll handle a bitch
No medallion earrings, that's played-out shit
A bitch is down for a car and a tennis bracelet
I want Venaditi, not Polo
I want DKNY, and not Girbaud
I want Anne Klein tennis, bitch, not K-Swiss
So nigga, get on the corner and sling that shit
And if your ass get shot, that's what you get
But motherfucker, I want the disability check
Now, you could say that's cold, but that's the way it is
You gotta show a nigga that you're all about biz
I don't feel sorry when it comes to ends
I'll leave your ass for three days in a shitty Depends
Now that you're paralyzed, do what I told you to
And make that tongue work for you

A licky-licky-licky-sucky-slurp it-licky-sucky
Licky-sucky slurp it, lick it, do it, nigga
A licky-licky-licky-slurp it-sucky-licky-slurp it
Licky-sucky slurp it, lick it, do it, nigga

Ain't no nigga like a pussy-eating nigga
Cause a slurping motherfucker ain't shit
I say, ain't no nigga like a pussy-eating nigga
Cause a scary motherfucker ain't shit
And ain't no pussy like a high-priced pussy
Cause a no-budget pussy ain't shit
I say, ain't no pussy like a high-priced pussy
Cause a no-budget pussy ain't shit

So nigga, if you want a nut
You better dig in that pocket and trick up
And if you go around saying I suck that dick
You better tell them how you did that lick
All the ladies say, nigga, you want to get a nut
You better dig in that pocket and trick up
And if you go around saying I suck that dick
You better tell them how you did that lick

And all the niggas say, bitch, stop talking that shit
And keep them messy-ass hoes out my business
And if you keep on hanging with them hoes
You're gonna find your fucking ass solo
Say bitch, stop talking that shit
And keep them messy-ass hoes out my business
And if you keep on hanging with them hoes
You're gonna find your fucking ass solo

You got to be real to take care of your woman

Cuz I know you're type hot boys don't wanna do right
Screwing everything then have the nerve to wanna have a good wife
Nah bump that baby get ya sneakers and ya beeper

It's the biggest Mama Mia X independent bringing weight to
The table I'm financial stable and able
To let you know what I'm not gone tolerate
Pay for everything I got you can't throw shit
In my face wait a minute let me finish my name ain't Sparkle
No promises from ten years ??? only sees one kind of mista
On a mission paper chasing building things with a sister
I get caught up in my rapture ??? got you like a groupie
Gimp but you ain't getting inside ride with me
Oh no floss of my dough floss me on your arm
Boo I don't think so fantasize about the sex
Even lie on your I suck what rode who nah

Have a wife giving broads two bills they think they living the life

And call you just another citizen living in it ya heard me?

Either ya too easy or ya too greedy I can't figure it out
I'm like forget it who need it
If I wasn't Silkk the Shocker would like really try to sweat me
I always had girls but not like Halle and Vanessa
Calling me on three talking about how they gon' do me
Shit I love my fans but I ain't gone be messing with yall groupies
Or either you hoochies
Coming to my concert talking about

I'm like back up but see I might mess with em put my trust in em
I just trust em to be women ya heard me?
Now see my car and she was like I ain't got no plans
See my crib and stuff and she was like I ain't got no man
If I give her a gift she be like girl that fool is laying
If I give her a kiss she be like that's my man he love he just be playing
So I might give you a gift but don't think I'm a trick
I just like to treat real women like they my number one chick
But I know when a women ain't tru black

You why cuz women do that ya heard me?

Won't 'cha, make your money and do what ya wanna

Let the champagne glasses, cashes, comin out the ass
Drinks for everybody, biggest mama stickin up the tab (Mama Mia)
Don't even ask if I could handle it
Bitch you didn't know I'm stackin ends like the Clampets (There it is)
Down south hustlin, workin my musc-lin
Mint greens labeled in God we trust'n
Bustin at the haters in the way of progress
Cause I ain't tryin to live from month to month (Naw) That's stress
I only want the best that there is off the top
But I ain't bout to brag about the shit I don't got
So when you see the E4-20 know that it's mine, paid out in full
So I put it in my rhyme
Thirty two hundred square foot, no doubt
Manicured landscape, and this my house
Paid out too, so I know I got the room
To state the fact that them hoes don't like that
But fuck that big timers put your knot in the air
And cock your nine for them jackers out there
Live your life, boy

Chorus X 2

[Fiend]
I be crackin like chiropractors
Fiend the young bachelor
That's too many muthafuckin million dollars, what I'm after
Meal ticket stash-a from brick flippin plaster
Now forever paid with Mama Mia and the Master
I cause disasters from the S's to the G
No clubs won't start without the presense of me
Ya better ask somebody, my cake give knee chills
Givin migraine headaches from breakin these bills
See these chills but can't get to it, we way out
Every (?) that I drive on chrome, is paid out
Close to the house on the hill, but no wife
Take the diamonds out my Rol, your house have no light
The more ice, I'm wicked you're sick, and just piss ya
Might take a long line, the dance floor on Whispers

Chorus X 2[Hook (2X)]
The bitchy

You can call me Thundercat
The bitch that know that?, you be looking when I shine
All on TV with LaChat and Mia on my super grind

[Verse 2: Gangsta Boo]
Put me on that private jet, other folks: what's that
DJ Paul showed y'all what it is, now look at that
I ain't playing withcha hoes mane
And it's simple and plain
Most of y'all boys be lame
He done fucked up the game

[Bridge]
Eat a girl cat or something, pay a bitch bills
Yeah I got my own money but I'd rather spend his

[Hook (2X)]

[Verse 3: Mia X]
Let's go!
Nigga why yo dick so small
You be pissing on your balls and all
Niggas your dick so small
Word is you can't stay hard at all
Steady popping bottles screaming "Nothing is a problem"
Living with yo mama, that's why you ain't got one
Get on your grown man, pull up your pants too
Smelling like a pound of weed and a tennis shoe
We independent women standing on our own two
You can't sell us dreams, show us whatcha gonna do
No pointless chit chatter, I came in here strictly
To let them niggas know that I am the bitchy bitchy

[Hook (2X)]

[Verse 4: La Chat]

And I'm da bitchy none of you hoes can take it, make you stick it

Or just shake for the Tenth Ward, shake for the Twelfth
Let them put the dick it's in an earthquake
Shake for Hollygrove, shake for the West Bank
Shake for the projects too
Hop for your neighborhood, hop for New Orleans
Know the rough hunting niggas, this for you

[Verse 3]
I ain't popping for no stunters, I use my head
And pop this pussy for a mink instead
I don't want no Shoney's or Denny's
But we could wine and dine at Copeland's, please
I don't need four golds in my mouth
But you can put Louis the Fourteenth in my house
I want a herringbone set and I want a purse
Bitch, I want to do me in verse
Met another nigga but he didn't like rubbers
(What?!) So he couldn't be my lover
Practice safe sex and keep the coochie clean
Because a nigga might turn your shits purple and green
And all you niggas out there claiming you don't eat
Everybody knows that that's a L-I-E
But since your ass do lie, I wish your nose did grow
Cause it would please me much better than what you got below
So where they at, get the gat and bounce baby to this
Uh, real woman shit
Niggety-niggety-nigga, I need some gear
So hustle that money and bring it here
And niggety-niggety-nigga, you better move fast
Bring me that Explorer filled up with gas
And make sure it's clean when I rep
So don't give me no-no-no don't give me carpet no sack(?)
And if I meet another nigga bumping in his shit
The pussy-ass nigga gotta deal with it

Cause ain't no nigga like a trick daddy nigga
Cause a tight motherfucker ain't shit
So if you squeak when you walk, you ain't legit
And you better just get on, bitch
All the ladies say, ain't no nigga like a trick daddy nigga
Cause a tight motherfucker ain't shit
So if you squeak when you walk, you ain't legit
And you better just get on, bitch

Now, this young nigga, he had a Benz
He had a pocket full of ends
So I pussy-whipped that ding-a-ling-ding
Cause I'mma get paid for doing my thing
Call me a bitch, or even a slut
But nigga, you know you paid for the guts
So talk that shit with your fake punk ass
But don't forget to tell them how you tricked that cash

What up, get up, boot up, c'mon
What up, get up, boot up, c'mon
What up, get up
Lick up, suck up, get up, pay up
Get up, trick up, what up, get up, what up

[Verse 4]
The Uptown women, they hauling fast
And quick to knock a motherfucker on his ass
The Downtown women got poison taste
You could smell our perfume when we walk in the place
Sassy and classy, but don't forget
With the blink of a eye, we'll handle a bitch
No medallion earrings, that's played-out shit
A bitch is down for a car and a tennis bracelet
I want Venaditi, not Polo
I want DKNY, and not Girbaud
I want Anne Klein tennis, bitch, not K-Swiss
So nigga, get on the corner and sling that shit
And if your ass get shot, that's what you get
But motherfucker, I want the disability check
Now, you could say that's cold, but that's the way it is
You gotta show a nigga that you're all about biz
I don't feel sorry when it comes to ends
I'll leave your ass for three days in a shitty Depends
Now that you're paralyzed, do what I told you to
And make that tongue work for you

A licky-licky-licky-sucky-slurp it-licky-sucky
Licky-sucky slurp it, lick it, do it, nigga
A licky-licky-licky-slurp it-sucky-licky-slurp it
Licky-sucky slurp it, lick it, do it, nigga

Ain't no nigga like a pussy-eating nigga
Cause a slurping motherfucker ain't shit
I say, ain't no nigga like a pussy-eating nigga
Cause a scary motherfucker ain't shit
And ain't no pussy like a high-priced pussy
Cause a no-budget pussy ain't shit
I say, ain't no pussy like a high-priced pussy
Cause a no-budget pussy ain't shit

So nigga, if you want a nut
You better dig in that pocket and trick up
And if you go around saying I suck that dick
You better tell them how you did that lick
All the ladies say, nigga, you want to get a nut
You better dig in that pocket and trick up
And if you go around saying I suck that dick
You better tell them how you did that lick

And all the niggas say, bitch, stop talking that shit
And keep them messy-ass hoes out my business
And if you keep on hanging with them hoes
You're gonna find your fucking ass solo
Say bitch, stop talking that shit
And keep them messy-ass hoes out my business
And if you keep on hanging with them hoes
You're gonna find your fucking ass solo

You got to be real to take care of your woman
You got to be real to take care of your children
You got to be real to take care of your mouth
You got to be real to keep your business in the South
So where the real niggas at, where the real niggas at?
Where ya at, peace me out, where ya at?
Where the real niggas at, where the real niggas at?
Where ya at, peace me out, where ya at?

You got to be real to take care of your children
You got to be real to stand by your man
You got to be real to dis a messy-ass ho
You got to be real to be down for yours
So where the real women at, where the real women at?
Where ya at, peace me out, where ya at?
Where the real women at, where the real women at?
Where ya at, peace me out, where ya at?[Mia X]

And the lady America was finally slaughtered
And divided into 3 quarters
Her children who was fit fell, peace
Battlin', golden', platinum
Friends of terror and endless bloodshed
Pity was not spared for no man, woman, child or rapper
And believe
For his rap was felt by everyone
And this time when trust had no meaning
Family and friends who survived destroyed one another
Decided to the world
Love, peace, and brotherhood
Soldiers, high ashes to survival
Master P
To open up a path to reality
For some, judgement

[Master P]

The devil took the straps off my nigga legs
The Virgin Mary came when my homie bleed
Too many fuckin' thieves and enemies
The vultures pecked the mouths for the green cheese
I watched his soul leave his clothes left him cold
On these streets, anything goes
He was on the road
It took 'em ten to do him in
The killas fled, damn, but they'll be back again
He was Polo'd down with the matchin' socks
I mean stuffed like a turkey with a half a key of cooked rocks
The reaper came and took him
I saw the tears from my baby mama's eyes over look him
As I walk through the shadow's of death
Where no rapper or no man can spare no breath
The kingdom of freedom is all they said
Why the shackle and chain?
My homie's life slain
From the cradle to the grave every soldier shall ride
Bite the apple of eternity (uggggHH)
Every mother will cry

[Chorus x2]

Keep your eyes on your enemies, and watch your friends
Put your life in your own hands, or your life will end

[Silkk]

Now who's to say if it's the beginning or ending
Start to finish
Losin' or winnin'
I'm trapped in a whole world of sin
Who's to say your life is worth more than mine
Should I give my heart to the President so he can live and I can die?
Now my whole life I was scared
The only judge is god
But why do I (we) live by these man made laws
Ten commandments they say do not steal or kill
But I lost to many niggas and some say they split my wig for meal
Heaven, leadin' up to the steps
Everything I do wrong in my days is leading to my death
And even though I never see
I believe there's a god
But I hate when your best friend turn to your enemy
When times is hard

[Chorus x2]

[Master P]

As the sand slowly poured
I see flashes of life
Time started ticking it's the end of my life
Blind fo' his eyes when he look at god
Behold no man or your life destroyed
He took many prophets and poured to the kingdom
Big ones and small ones
Good ones and mean ones
As the angel came the ghetto from hell
Some words of peace cuz they didn't know no better
So they sold to the pitch-forks of the fire
Do g's go to heaven or just young niggas retire
Crosses burned cuz they souls was scarred
Hoping for second chance but ain't none
Cuz it's yo' final call

[Chorus till fade][Silkk The Shocker]

Yo, Silkk The Shocker, Serv-On (and the biggest mamma)
Bout to rip this bitch
Think not. Believe that
Trying to do somethin for ya nigga!
Uh huh, want yall to dance
For the dance floor
We gonna do somethin new
Touch your head, your shoulders, your knees and your toes
Slide once too and stomp your feet on the floor
Throw your hands up
Back in this bitch
We bout to get rowdy

[Hook x2]

Touch your head, your shoulders, your knees your toes
I want you twirk that body right across the floor
Cause gangstas dont dance man we groove
I want you hoes bouncin your ass when you move

Nigga I step through the door
Clear my throat like DJ Kool (cough cough)
Cause I lay back motherfucking fool, down more hoes then pool
You know like me comin through this bitch sick or
Watchin em with my dick hard
Put my dime to the side as I slide my way to the bar
Dig this ho named Michelle
Or it could have been Danielle, Tanielle
Kiss and tell I won't
Keep it on DL (you know I'm smooth like that)
I'm smooth like that, I'm cool like that
And a wreck like effect, jack a fool like that
See, I see some ho from the rear come over here
Whisper in here ear make myself clear
Fortune let's break up out of here
See boy watch how I bust when I run through it
The game I spit get my hoes, fuck it alcohol and slow music
You know how I do it run the game on em

Huh, nothin wrong with making you bumpin and grind nigga

[Hook x2]

[Mr. Serv-On]

Hit the bar I'm your star Mr. serve alazay
With the chrome keg, so how you play
Six hundred on them things in the parking lot
I like to bang alot, my babies momma never called alot
So ain't no stop when I drop a flick for the chicken
Licking on your breast
And your necks in the club step
So what's next, I'm bout a drink or two
One for me, three for you
I gotta woman you can be my boo
You say your name is Tiki so how you wanna see me
Twenty five for guest
On my rolex ticks on the wrist
I know you with this
Drop the number on the under you can be my hit
For the same no wonder you keep coming around
My homie young Silkk put me down with the game and the flow
If I teach you how to touch your head
Your shoulders, your knees and your toes
I can flip that ass till the morning light it's my life

[Hook]

[Mia X]

Might wanna shuffle all the way to the dance floor
Get your hands up, tell the DJ to turn it up
A bottle or more, with a straw in my right hand
I know I'm feeling good cause very seldom do I dance
I usually play it cool moving side to side
Be too clean to sweat, but tonight it's all right
Got my ice on shine like melt the club
And I ain't trying to go home until the sun comes up
Nigga what
Ain't no leaving with you
I ain't no one night rome (who you think I am)
You'll be hustlin all your life
So you can afford these droors
Your pimping gotta be large, converse to the point
Then in a month maybe we can blow this joint
And you can meet my up and down southern rodeo
For sho', chewbaccas leaving niggas on my toes
Oh, the biggest mammas hard, laying non stop
Hold up, I think I see some playas kickin off the bus stop
And twirkers pop while them niggas watch em get hot
You all know this shit don't stop so let the chorus drop

I be the reason why they buried ya, and carried ya
I be the nigga that put the wood in your fiance
The reason why she didn't marry ya
I be the nigga they try to keep from around, hanging around your sister
I be the nigga they call Silkk The Shocker, you might call me MISTER!
Now I got a mob ties, I'm a ghetto wise guy
Military minding, on the front lines, always pull off the drive bys
Case over like the last song, like all the cash gone
Heir to the throne, cause I'm the little brother of the last don
Little bitch can't mix, flip shit, loose lips sink ships
Plus I gotta pair of cement shoes, I can make fit, your a fake bitch
Keep my ice wrist, keep her tight bitch, between the trigger
Keep a tight grip, infrared on my shit so I don't miss
Now I'm that razor that cuts the dope, it ain't nothin but a 504
Member the one they call Vito, yeah that's me (you know)

When the live brown hit the chamber, I'm the click clack
When you run, I'm the danger, I'm the smack and the pimp slap
I'm the shit that bubble up when you cook that crack
The nigga that fucked up the party when I pull my strap
The nigga that fucked all the hoes I'll be trying to mack

The nigga that taught your little brother
How to cook that dope (Kane & Abel)

And I'm a end this motherfucker cause it ain't no more time[Hook x2]
Slow down I can't take the heat
Slow down, it's wicked in these streets

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Life ain't nothing but a big old twist
A lot of times when I'm smoking, I'm doing that just to reminisce
It's funny, on how shit be
A lot of money, make y'all wanna come get me
But look here, I work hard for all the things I got
And to hang with a niggas just an intricate plot
You smoke my weed, you try to bang my hoes
And talk bad about a nigga, behind closed doors
But look here, dog, a ho once told me loc
Bite the hand that feeds you, and you'll wind up broke
Bitch niggas don't deserve to kick it
With rich niggas, nigga we seven figure niggas
And we bigger than the biggest hip hop, niggas of rap
And when we get to spittin', make sure y'all step back
You with that? Cause if you ain't clown
We from the D-O double G, we groupie true and slow down

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Mia X]
Ayyo Snoop, I used to kick up dope, ride with niggas
Know about the hits, hang with killas
Take the broads down for jailhouse visits
Keep my bed warm with a cutthroat nigga
Have the card parties where the stakes was high
Go shopping, hit the club, and then start come by
I never had a day without no drama
Half the OG's age but they call me mama
Had the ganja overstuffed in the hefty bag
Orange peels to kill the smell slanging with my dad
I never thought about my life I swear y'all for real
Until my best friend Jill got killed
And then I, dropped to my knees and called on the Lord
Please change my ways cause I'm living too hard
And too foul, how I'm gon' raise a child
When I'm out here buck wild?
Damn I had to slow down

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Mia X]
Yeah, I slow my roll down to a pimp strut
And started putting all this game on records
For my come up from sun up to sun down
I'm trying to get my money
Haters ain't gon' stop me cause haters can't run me
It's funny when a bitch was livin' foul
Everybody seemed glad but now they mad
Cause I'm flossing, boss ballin' guilt free
And feds can't take shit from me, so slow down

[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg]
I got niggas, shot niggas, drop niggas for fun
I swap from these shoulders, I don't need no gun
But it's the 90's and niggas don't bump by the end of the round
The clown bound to dump, young chump
You don't wanna get caught up in the mix
Cause I'm a soldier, blasting at the rollers, bitch
We don't, never ever, talk no shit
Unless we back that shit up, nigga you get lit

[Hook x2]

Slow down I can't take the heat
Slow your roll, tuck your heat and watch the haters

[Chorus: Master P]
If it don't fold, if it don't ching ching
Then you ain't a real soldier, if you can't maintain
If it don't fold, if it don't ching ching
Then you ain't a real soldier, if you can't maintain

[Mia X]
Now mama can't be compared to no other broad
Cause I spit that mental and keep (Shhh)
Them niggas  peeling off Franklins
Franky # 1, I'm on the force checks in my hands
Most demand to be man's thugs Mrs
I piss on all you so-called fire starters
And all you fakes claiming flow I'm known to touch
Your water I started with a quarter flip my way to six figures
Ground work down and dirty hustling like a nigga
I figured ain't no sense in sleeping if my kids ain't eating
And ain't no sense in you creeping if you ain't treating
I'm seeking dollars if you with me baby follow me
Trying to buy a key like it's a ticket out of poverty
But every key don't always open up a friendly door
On the other side might be the law so
Plain strategies clean your g's and keep it coming
Don't be another ghetto child hustling for nothing

[Chorus]

[Master P]
(Uhhhhhhh)
I'm a ball till I fall nigga pops wasn't home
Put it in a zip lock bag or either ride with the chrome
I thank god for my big cousin Jimmy nigga taught me how to hustle
See life is like a puzzle always in and out of trouble
From the jail to the street we hustle till we weak
From a quarter to a key nigga momma gotta eat
See this ghetto got me crazy
And if it wasn't for no limit could they pay me
Two million in the bank for the babies
Independent black owned is why they pay me

[Chorus]

[Silkk the Shocker]
(What What What)
Now look dollars I'm trying to fold
Three keep me rolling like wheelchairs
See I'm from the south I love east and west
Just like I lived there Ran the streets with my thugs
Often I sold (Shhh) I'd be lying if I'm tell you i'm doing
This rap stuff strictly out of love I'm in it for the money
But ya'll can keep the fame and all that
Bitch let it be known that my name I bring like all that
Hate me that I got riches Hate that I got bigger
Even got picture of me flossing in drop 6s
I like to have things and I don't like to dream
Picture my benz riding rubber 20s so I put em on 19s
Aim high my dream house cost about 6 mil
I wanna step out the house cause I paid boy
About six bills No limit and mean green you gotta
Like respect our flow Respect our dough
Respect that we trying to get some more
Major players do what they want You haters
Do what ya'll can I'm trying to bury money
Understand For my real g's 100s and grams
See I'm a no limit soldier so I'm a represent

As we groove into this new millenium
You know It's time for us to make our kids proud
Time to take care of our families like we supposed to

Nigga, I'm bustin me locs, but I'm hittin em down with jokes

Got niggas and G's, and rollin keys keys to record sto's
Get paid wit fatals, niggas harder than Cato
Nigga turnin the tables, but niggas livin like potatoes
Get chopped up in game, niggas runnin my name
Master P up in chain, is he dead he's a man
But I be bustin, hustlin, niggas ain't trustin
I'm a soldier, that's why niggas ain't trustin
No bitch or no nigga, ho or no sucka
Fiend or no clucker, but ready to hustle
With boulders, bigga than yo' shoulders
Runnin from the rollers, gone on that doja
Cause cowards despise, soldiers we ride
Killers with attitudes, but ready to die
Cause chickens get plucked, hoes get fucked
Turkeys get stuck, and niggas get cuffed
Ready for combat, my gat with my hard hat
Strapped with my crew and my niggas and all that
Down for whatever, niggas straight rowdy
Ask any motherfucker in America they'll tell ya, we bout it
Soldiers out there tech, bustin don't think

Fuckin with them soldiers on the tank, cause

Chorus: Master P

We No Limit soldiers -- I thought I told ya (repeat 8X)

Verse Two: Silkk the Shocker

Let's get ready to rumble, them niggas stumble

No Limit soldiers, close your eyes
Now picture me foldin dollar bills
I stay fuckin Tru, nigga fuck it, nigga do ya
Nigga I come to life and I scare all y'all bustas like Freddy Kruger
Gangstafied nigga, true to the game nigga
Stay fuckin pullin triggas, fuck up all y'all niggas
Cause I'm so fuckin T-R-U, representin I thought you knew

That's all I be around, nigga fuckin fool
About face, this No Limit soldier

Now all my soldiers start fightin

Lethal Weapon like Danny Glover, smother like jelly
Really, go deep like Jim Kelly
Fuck it, all y'all bustas open up y'all belly
Think we playin bitch, well we ain't

Put up the Benz and now we drive the tank
Cause all I want to be was a soldier
All I want to be was a soldier, soldier

Chorus 1/2

Verse Three: C-Murder

I'm a No Limit motherfuckin soldier till I die
We run this place, and I say the same shit, with a gun up in my face
I ain't scared to die, bitch like I said before, ho
3rd Ward, I'm from that motherfuckin Calliope
Projects supported worldwide by drug dealers
Transformin wimpy ass niggas into killers
Taking over, worldwide, doin shows oversea
Bringing bitches to the telly, put them hoes upon they knees
Gangstafied, like my motherfuckin homies Kane and Abel
No Limit, the world's number one fuckin rap label (worldwide)
Competition get smoked like we smokin blunts
I take a playa hata and knock out his fuckin fronts
Dope slanga, now I'm slangin CD's
A million records (platinum), it used to be some quarter keys
TRU tattooed on my back bitch thats my click
Ready to hop into some motherfuckin gangsta shit
I say No Limit loud, cause we ain't scared of nobody
Organized by P or should I say, John Gotti
Real niggas, put ya guns up if ya feel me
But if ya talk shit, bitch ya betta kill me
Like Skull I'm a hoodlum 4 life, I told ya
We be some motherfuckin No Limit TRU soldiers

Chorus 1/2

Verse Four: Mia X

Hard times got my mind on cock, and massive thoughts be the plot
Top priorities the family dope and royalty
My loyalty, fiends with a gang of true niggas
No colors, just a bunch of ignorant motherfuckers
Trust my pen is an infa-red
Hollow-tips be my lyrics dipped in venom when I send em
They split ya head (pssssh) wide open
My rhymes on fire blood, but you can't smoke ne'er a one
Don't try to come, don't even touch the mic
My shit so tight, it's more correct than right, when I recite
Absolutely, you booty-ass hoes and niggas
Perpetratin behind water gun triggers
Hurry up and figure out that studio Gotti's catch hotties to the mouth
Who got that clout, don't act surprised cause it's that bitch from the South
Mia X hoes, you don't want no problems
Get so much respect, even yo' niggas call me momma, the biggest one
To come stompin out the N.O., the crescent
Testin, chin-checkin, wreckin when I'm flexin on your WHOLE crew
Who wants to go to war with this lyrical arsenist
Ya talkin shit, I'll having ya runnin for the thesaurus, cause I'm walkin wit
The big dogs without hesitation, Unlady Like as ever
Full of, verbal annhilation
Escaping, po-po's chasin, want ta catch me but they cain't
I made em think, and now they too scared to run up on the tank
No Limit, you can start it, but we niggas is the hardest
To deal wit, keeps the steel, and the plastics to peel wit
In reach, so we can touch yo' ass
And leave a bout it scarf on ya face, we soldiers

Chorus 3/4

I thought I told ya
TRU niggas wave ya guns, show ya tattoos
Soldiers foe life nigga
Jumpin off the tank
Stay true to the gizame-Check this out uhhhh
-I mean
-you ever had one of them gangsta relationships
-I mean like, nobody don't have to gisnote

[Hook]

I can be your nigga
He can be you man
You don't have to leave him
Everybody need a back-up plan

[Master P]
Jump in my 97 Hummer and riside
You be Ms Bonnie, I'll be Mr. Clyde
Together we be catchin g's
Flipping keys, smokin weed
It's all about you and me
Causing major pain on this dope game
You be Halle Berry
I'll be the ghetto Damon Wayans
In charge like the Lakers
You got your pink 380
I got my black nine for the haters
My homies call you that nigga
But you my bitch
Since we banging, I guess we one click
You be that nigga that I drink with
And you don't even trip if I was to let a freak kiss
You give me rubbers so I can stay strapped
You say you can't catch no fucking rat
Without a mouse trap
So we be kicking it like g's
Its a drought, but you got a connect on some keys
You roll up the ?? and drink 40s'
You'll whoop any bitch at any ghetto party
We walk past security cause you got the strap
And when my homies see ya
You the only female they give dap
You the only nigga that I'll kiss
Make love to and still do some gangsta shit with
Like Menace to Society we kick it
I'm Kane, you my thug like Ms Jada Pinkett

[Hook x4]

[Mia X]
I lays back and chill
Why you ills with the hotties
I'm numero uno in your eyes honey poppi
Yo lady Gotti
Thugged out, hooriding ready to kill
Yet make me feel like others can't with my sex appeal
Be riding ghetto thrills
But still the bitch behind the trigger
The bitch about her scrilla
The bitch to smack her nigga
If the tone faintly rises in his voice
The choice is mine
When it comes to haters living or dying
Blueprinted crimes illustrated by your baby
The unlady like mistress
Be all about illicit business
Bitches witness us together looking tenderly
But to scared to tell wifey, for fear of me
I'm only trying to be the one with the green papers
Bounce on the dick and help me pull off a mean caper
That's why you praise the biggest mama and you care
Other hoes get x'd out in what we share yeah
I give you rubbers for your friends for show
Take me shopping tomorrow
Short change them hoes
Save them 3 more nuts for me
Alize, hot tubs and an ounce of weed
Please, there's not a jealous bone in my body
Take me off to Jamaica
Then take your wifey to (aloha) Hawaii
I don't mind being number 2
You keep more ice on my hands and wrists
Than an igloo
And if it all falls through you still got me
Your true bitch nigga down to hustle
From plan B

[Mia X]
Like that nigga

[Master P]
Like that nigga

[Mia X]
But only if you bout it
Master P: Only if you bout it

[Mia X]
I can be your mistress
You can keep your wifey
I understand
I'm all good with this back-up plan

And how the fuck we stay on billboards more than the marbolo man

We watch them die holdin' their riches and they bitches
Diggin' up ditches for the snitches in this ghetto

Tell my hoes I never rest 'til they murder my foes
When a cop done shot when a cop done dug and I watched
Them bullets snatch me lookin' at my camoflauge
Makin' sure they didn't blast me
When I die bury me in my camoflauge cuz I'll be down with
My thug motherfuckers other niggas ride 'til its over
We gone live and breath soldiers

[Mia X]
I'm still on more times tryin' pay the bills with ryhmes
Criminal thoughts makes my nine in the picture much clearer

Open shot on your block and drop the shit your system's got
What no limit soldiers kickin' up dust in your face
Rowdy rowdy when we march in the place we face

Woke one morning, tears in my eyes
The feds kicked in the door and caught me and my baby by surprise
He got high, but they didn't find no dope
They said it was conspiracy just cause a hater said so
Now we might do time in the penn
But the state dont have a case without witnesses and no evidence
So I guess once again that it's on
But I really wish the haters would just leave us alone

But all the goin find is some ghetto dope
So come on, so would you just let a bitch live
Stack my ends and raise my kids
Ride my benz, flow my ice

You better think before you call Tyrone
Can you trust him
Is he real
Does he look you in the eyes and make you feel what he's saying
Shit I ain't playing
My stomach's in knots
Remember the last niggas you felt they got you robbed and shot
I gots no time for new friends
Some of the old ones ain't cool
You ain't kicked it with this nigga since high school
And you twenty-two now
All a sudden y'all exchanging numbers callin
You don't think that nigga heard you ballin
Fuck that
I smell a rat
And I can hear the gats click clack
Along with the sirens
And special forces teams
Or can it be that infrared beam and ski masks
Niggas on a mission who say they gots to have it
I'm grasping at straws
And you think I'm picking with cha
But you gots to stay one up on them niggas
For they come and get cha
You figure since y'all go way back them that matters
Sometimes they be the first to ratta tatta

Chorus: Mia X

Friend or foe
You never know who's real
Who's fake
Who's mask of love disguise hate
You never know
Break bread sleep in your house
Then turn around and rat you out

Friend or foe
You never know who's real
Who's fake
Who's mask of love disguise hate
You never know
Break bread sleep in your house
Then end up being rivals in a shot out

Verse 2: Mac

Have you ever pulled a caper
With a nigga who you thought was your ace
Y'all got separated he got caught
And they took him to that place
With no hesitation
He was coughing up all kinds of information
Ole, master splint ass nigga
Can't handle interrogation
Type of nigga that see your killer
But instead of informing you
Act like he don't see shit
Walk away without warning you
Ain't that cold
Cause you remember when he had slept on your couch
When his other partner had kicked him out
For running his god damn mouth
But see ah that's the type of shit your girl was telling you bout
And she told you he was trying to fuck every time you left the house
You thought he was only tripping
And that she was only bitching
Till you caught in your kitchen
Trying to shove his little dick in
What you love
So now you in the pen for it
Oh yeah you shot him so now you doing ten for it
Niggas don't give a fuck
They would rob you now
And drink with you later
Rape your sister
Go to school with you
And cheat on your paper

(Chorus) until song fadesArtist: Mia X f/ TRU (Master P, C-Murder, Silkk)
Album:  Unlady Like
Song:   4ever TRU

[Mia X]
1, 2, T-R-U, and Mia X, the biggest mamma
Click tight, for life, family ties
That's right. It's bigger than this record shit, nigga
All for one and one for all, that's how we ball

TRU, forever, that's my family
We be's on top the cheddar pile
Wet you up like the Nile
Enemies bleed in wartime, illicit rhymes
Illustrated crimes, pucker up, kiss my 9
Mia's kid sister, buckin misters and misses for figures
Trick ya, we set ya up and then we get ya
It's the biggest mamma showin love to my sons and brothers
And we gon blow the roof right off this muthafucka
For the niggas ridin with this TRU click, it ain't No Limit
To my loyalty and strong arm authority
Admit it, I'm finna show day to day soap opera
Downtown hoes unload when the ??? choppers knock ya
Head off in a split, put ya lips
Around this plastic dick, a Kodak moment
For this click, I don't mind dyin, takin a stand
In line, while bustin my 9
I'm tryin to show you through my verbal demonstration
We ain't bout fakin
We bringin home the cheese, greens, and the bacon
Takin no shorts and nothing that'll do
I'm representin, boo, mamma's 4ever TRU

Chorus (4X) I be's a TRU nigga till I'm dead (we bout it, bout it)
	         TRU soldiers ready to die (and rowdy, rowdy)

[Master P]
Put one in the chamber or that plastic Glock
I'm on the grind, that 3rd Ward, Calliope, pushin rocks
Gon off dolja, a No Limit soldier
Got love for killas and dealas and I told ya
But my homegirl is hella hard
Nigga, Master P, Silkk, Mia X, livin large
Gangbangin on this dope set
Smoke any nigga, bitch a click, like a cigarette
Now that's one to grow on
If you still bout it, bout it, muthafucka, bring yo bitch ass on
Cause we be bout killin, bout murder
Puttin muthafuckas in six feet girdles
Hustlin hard to pay the rent
Mamma cryin cause I know this don't make no fuckin sense
But I gotta clock cheese, to get my Gs
To stake my keys, to make OZs
Work in the project
An expedition in the house, note them pesos, we slang crack
TRU niggas stick together cause we ballin
One for all, if we fallin

Chorus (4X)

[C-Murder]
I'm tatooed up (No Limit) and TRU to the game
Steady mobb'n, you muthafuckas know my name
Down for whatever at the drop of a dime
With my TRU niggas cautious on my rhyme, pick up my 9
Like that, but we be comin like this
Don't fuck with this click or ya might get lynched
Have your mama at the funeral, tissues, weepin
Due to the fact you got caught up in a street sweepin
No hesitation, you layin a stank
C-Murder will kill for any TRU soldier wearin a tank
We stick together like crazy glue
Ya'll read about the hatas tryin to infiltrate my fickin crew
Bow down, and give No Lomit it's props
Gangsta rap pays the bills, sellin tapes, stopped sellin rocks
Breakin bread with muthafuckin ballas
P, C, Silkk, and Mia X, TRU shot callers
They asked me would take a bullet for ya homie
Ready to die for any stomach with a TRU tatoo on it
Get more support than a city after a hurricane
Radios and videos, now everybody know my name
We be ballin like the Dream Team in my crew
No Limit for life, and always 4ever TRU

Chorus (3X)

[Silkk]
4ever muthafuckin TRU, thought ya knew
Nigga, it's a must, it's a trust
If ya tell me what aim, I'm a bust
See one by one, niggas doin shows month by month
We ain't nothin nice
TRU niggas roll tight like fuckin blunts
Fuck them bustas that lookin for us
Nigga, we ain't hard to find
Fuck em, hidin, I'm probably makin a 500 SEL
With my convertible top down
And my cellular phone just ridin
Mia told me, represent
Watch out for niggas who muthafuckin phonies
Would you take a bullet for the president?
Nah, but I'd take a bullet for my TRU homie
I thought you knew, homie
Ya'll rappers tryin to be drug dealas and killas
We killas and drugs dealas turned rappers
Everything I know
Been got in for murder to muthafuckin kidnappin
Ya'll mad cause we hustle, ya'll ain't
Ya'll mad cause ya'll can't stack bank
I'm actin bad for the tank
Ya'll do what ya'll could, I'll do what ya'll can't
Nigga get game, I smoke that ass just like dank
For everytime I'm puttin in work, add stripes to my rank
Nigga, we TRU fuckin soldiers, willin, I betcha
Nigga, if ya ball, I'm there for ya, if ya fall
I'm gon catch ya
Cause I'm gon put it down for all my hustlas
Who be nationwide ballin
TRU niggas ain't fallin, we callin
From California to New Orleans
Turn my back on my soldiers is somethin I'll never do
Silkk the Shocker, take my tatoo, I'm 4ever TRU

Momma mia got 5 motherfuckin reasons
Why you niggas shouldn't step 2 no limit
CCick, clat, duck

[Big Ed:]
Big Ed be puttin down like that
I'm on the attack
Hit your block with the tech & flip you like an acrobat
Relax and get done in
No limit got you suckas runnin
Hustlin, tank rollin, feather weight lifting
King of the hill like the pistons
Listen and get hypnotized
Then they'll realize your mobbs tried to hustle with ride surprise
As I analyze fictional rap chart
Niggas sellin the flea market
As I swell up like Dolly Pardon
Flow like Niagara, floss like dental
Niggas dont get caught up in my detrimentral mental
Alias assassin im blastin ask alot
While tough niggas talk from Richmond to Ottawa
Lyrical combat but we can jump into realm of bookoo guns
No Limit should be a steel mill
Catacombs when I rush
Explode when my vocals hit the west
KL be droppin the bomb tracks
Like terrorists and anvils

Capital F-I- as I live like Incredible Hulk
I love my money in bulks
See im used to the abuse of
Marijuana, smokin coke tryin to reach my quota
Revoking mc's nice as he's
Cause im twice as nice as he's
Its your fears im splittin back they lids
Or the wigs that I live
Die instanly, searchin comin after me
Haven't learned nothin in the galaxy as bad as me
Fatalities, all yall gone be casualities
A formality, droppin dead weight rappers like calories
So casually speakin
Like ?? we beaten
But not preaching
The lyrical reaching gone leave you skiing illegally
And I gets my swerve on
With Mr. Serv On
Gettin a helluva spursion
With KL's and Burbons
Definetly  get my verse on
Got it changed by a Glock
Words that bracing you knot
My shit stay banging like Little Rock

[Kane]

My hustling is sick
Kane & Abel cake makes flips
252 grams be catching ? out each quarter brick
My deliveries obscenity, so niggas these fightin words
Watch Mr. bill collector Hannibal Lector smoke the herb
2 times 187 equals 374
What the mean im gone leave you and that buster you with stankin on the floor
Hope you got your life insurance
This deadly metomorphosis hollow tips ??
Bringing horror flicks to tricks
Raw flicks couldn't see me, if you were lookin at my picture at the post office
1,2,3 bitch im G, thats in gangstafied
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde got no friends P keep the world homely and homicide
My style can't stop it
Got a gat lets drop it
Nice, strictly ice im precise like fuckin fiber optics
Hennessy got me tested
Cut that mask like Wayne Gretsky
Soldiers man desert eagle in my hand keep em' ?? like Dissy Gillepsie
Top cops couldn't arrest me
Niggas who the best be
This no limit soldiers runnin on the tank
Nigga got no time to think
Bustin on you niggas yall stink
I got my shank
The Puerto Rican leave them tweekin
Missles heat seaking
Niggas that couldn't stop me got your amplifier peakin

[Abel:]

Niggas is fake
I piss on you face at your wake (fucking bastard)
Spary paint this shit ain't over on your casket
Preacher man steady sayin thou shall not kill
I wonder if he was there when they killed my nigga Clarence at the hotel
In the city of fiends, young niggas die often
Get your hustle in hell, I left an ounce in your coffin
Young niggas gettin touched with AK's early in the moring
Catch a glimpse of the devil when he dance in New Orleans
Hollow shots make a nigga check in before his curfew
Disrespect me ill hurt you, pass the blunts in a circle

[Mr. Serv On:]
Dolly dolly dip
Wich one of you niggas want this last and final hollow tip (none)
For real from mr bitch killer money maker ho stacker
Stackin more green than the Packers
Nigga jack a Regal rider
Have you bubblin on your saliva like Hannibal Lector
Step up in the sector
UPT ain't the drives
Hit you between your eyes
Crack your bitch thighs
Mr. cap peller
Smile into the eyes of your candy dealer
Big wheeler
Stackin more diamonds that the steelers
Bringing more noise that the Cowboys
Can chop in it like Dennis the born Menace
Dont say a fuckin thang until im finished
And even then respect my blessing
I'll make Allen Iverson adress me as the real question
And niggas know me when I come through
So if im not screaming TRU (T-R-U) nigga im ready to bang at you and you
So fell this hollow tip and get what you get
Mr. gangsta shit
Mr. B-a-v-g-a-t-e
Mr. S-e-r uh v
For all you bitch niggas
You understand niggas you ready to feel this trigger
So step up and feel this lesson from the last and final hollow tip
Thats what you get, some gangsta shit

[Mia:]
I tried to told yall ain't want heard me
So anybody out there think that they ready
Lyrically or Physically
I have one question
Can we please get into some gangsta shit
This is mama mia the biggest
Signing off with my tank dawgs[Mia X (1)]
What, what, what, what, what, what, what
Huh nigga, huh nigga what, huh nigga what what what what
Huh nigga what, what huh nigga what

[Verse 1]
The crime started off, bloody
It's about pistol whippins and kickins
Mama dishin' and blitzin' (Mama Mia)
Cause you hoes gon' listen
Taught to issue the pain
And distribute some cocaine
Can you fuck man, nah nah
I'm known for loosen' brains
Bitch you think that I'm playin'
Go to war by myself, grab that gat off the shelf
Gon' say goodbye to your health
Got heroin in the mail but bet my dollars don't fumble
Stackin' tall like Mutombo, cause a bitch moving bundles, rumble
It ain't no thang bitch I'm straight off the tank
Niggas second in motion, I'm a fool with that shank
No, I ain't 2 be trusted
When I sneak I'm straight bustin' ya mouth
And ya nose and your eyes gon' close, swole
My kid sister Sherry puttin' big holes, in ya
Po-po's trying to find the next nigga ya kin to
Red dot center, bullets enter ya playa haters
My lace tip split ya fuckin' decision maker
Think you can take the biggest mama, bring the drama, go on
But make it known, official it's on

[Chorus]
I ain't to be played wit', so fuck around and see what ya get
Toasting fingers to clips, playa haters get split
I'm running, humping your shit now rock-a-bye you look tired
So don't fight it baby close your eyes
I ain't to be played wit', so fuck around and see what ya get
Toasting fingers to clips, playa haters get split
I'm running, humping your shit now rock-a-bye you look tired
So don't fight it baby close your eyes

[Verse 2]
When I hoo-ride (Tank Dogs) I only ride T-R-U
Niggas out that booty or mister Corey Jalooty
Shoot now, fuck the convo nigga ain't no stoppin'
When it's on we poppin', street sweeper straight knockin'
What, what cocaine and trains leavin' niggas in gutters
Bringing pain to loved ones, burning up motherfuckers
Plus if ya touch one of mine this is how it's gonna be
I'm choppin' down your whole family tree
Forget me not, it's too hot
Up in that south, bitch you know how dirty
Better act in a hurry or I'ma load it with thirty
Dirty, serve me nigga by the pounds and kilos
And watch the gumbo pot, we breed the fattest rocks
Bag em' after the chop, push em' out the back door
Have the prepiest hoes runnin' buku dough
Yet the game is cold, raw dog to the bone
Gotta love Jones, for whackin' chrome upside niggas domes
If it's on then it's on ain't no need to delay it
Bout it bout it motherfuckers no I ain't to be played wit'

[Chorus (x2)]

[Mia X 1] to fade[Chorus 1]
All niggas buy for pussy, cried for pussy
Lied for pussy, live for pussy, steal for pussy
Snuck for pussy, killed for pussy
All niggas buy for pussy, cried for pussy
Lied for pussy, live for pussy, steal for pussy
Snuck for pussy, killed for pussy

[Chorus 2]
Who's the playa, who's the pimp, who's the mack
Push em' back, we need some elbow room, we need some elbow room
Don't sweat it
Who's the playa, who's the pimp, who's the mack
Push em' back, we need some elbow room, we need some elbow room
Don't sweat it, shake that ass, nigga work that back
Nigga rock that dick, you the bitch tonight
Nigga shake that ass, nigga work that back
Nigga rock that dick, you the bitch tonight nigga
Ah yeah, here we go in the place where the big lips at
Let me see ya face, uh
Fuck you right give us what we need
I'm talkin' to the niggas with the big cheese
Two minutes, Johnny come fast
Ain't no sense in fucking yo ass
Penny pinchers, Johnny too tight
Ain't no way you gon' fuck a TRU bitch tonight

[Verse 1]
Fuck them dog ass niggas they ain't workin'
Got a nine inch dick but what's the use if you can't work it
Wanna get it licked, bitch get ya mind right
Sweaty nuts still smelling like the last fuck
Hell naw this sister ain't got ya back
When bachelor pad is more like ya mama's couch
I passed on him again like I always do
Mama Mia got the razor-sharp lyrics nigga I thought you knew
I flow through five, violent niggas everyday
Flip scripts on tricks get the stuff and yay
My way all the time nigga ain't no doubt
Keep my pussy in ya mouth even at ya mom's house
Southside she-devil biggest mama sister of blessing
One whole, making sisters noid nigga
No figures no stickers, but you can for sho' lick us
From the tits to the clit, ass crack all day
It's the same shit you niggas like to floss
Knowin' you can't live without our draws
Boss bitches ain't no time for you to be dumb
If you ain't about getting no cash nigga you ain't the one

[Mia X singing]
Boy don't you call me if you ain't lickin' and giving money
If you ain't treating, no shopping spreesin'
Paying my car out and buying me a house
Boy don't you call me if you ain't lickin' and giving money
If you ain't treating, no shopping spreesin'
Paying my car out and buying me a house

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Mia X speaking]
For real, Mama Mia putting it down for sisters worldwide
I'm still in here representing hard than a motherfucker
Raw as a dog
I gotta send a special shout out to my hometown
Where this type of music come from, the N.O
The Big Cheese, the dressing, New Orleans
We in here, uh
