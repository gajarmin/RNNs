[Hook: Dej Loaf]
Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (static)
I swear I love my city, I just want less (static)
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (static)
Detroit vs. Everybody

[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9"]
I took a bite out the rotten apple by the poison tree
All these females need to email to make noise
And now things changin' a lot, he fuck with my authority
Then he shall see shells, but not by the seashore
If he gang bangin' or not
It's simple as the alphabet
He F with me, that G shall surely see
He definitely as 'bout it as retail fraud, he's sweet
The honest gesture
The trigger finger 'round the diamond tester
We tell flaw with heat
The same soldier, it's me, myself and I
Ridin' 'round shootin' my biopic in my autobiography
Range Rover, this ain't the squash beef state
You thinkin' makeup, we thinkin' Lark Voorhies face
The twin Eagles ol' Air, his coupe
Might as well ride by in an ambulance
My pair'll shoot like skydivin' in Hammer pants
So call it siblin' rivalry
Take his life, call it the unforgivable robbery
A wise man told me that holdin' a grudge is like
Lettin' somebody just live inside of your head rent free
(Real talk) I don't got time to evict these clowns
Y'all niggas been bitches, that's none of my business, but I don't sip tea
(It's Nickel) Ridin' 'round this block
All he knows is pitfalls, that's why he's always climbin' out his drop
(I got a question) Do you wanna ride or die?
(Welcome to Detroit, motherfucka)

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Boy I need no halves and halves, I want the game in entirety
100 percent cut, no stitches required
Welcome to Detroit where if you get that promotion
Don't worry, man them bullets will still be at your ass firin'
I still call it safe, I would suck if I was umpirin'
Boy I hit the beat I just treat that shit like a diary
I'm offended if you hear my new shit and you ain't rewindin' me
Self made, I never needed your bail or a wire, see
I'm never callin' collect, I call to collect
My homie wanted a Chevy so I put my dog in the vet
Ahh! Plus I'm so loyal that that paper, boy, is all that I fetch
If the ball in my hand then the ball in the net
Bitch I'm the D, can't no offense dunk on me
I'm Mr. Big Shot, these hoes get drunk off me
I'm overrespected, my mama gated community's overprotective
So futuristic, I'm already over my next bitch
Reminiscin' on listenin' to 50 fifty times a day
Back when tenth grade was like fifty days away
Tryna get paid fifty ways a day
Used to put fifty on the layaway, now my closet fifty shades of grey
Twenty six and I done lived a lifetime a few times
From futons to Grey Poupons
In church tryna get a little savings, yeah coupons
I spit that A1 every day, I'm hittin' new primes
Now the stakes high, niggas surprised at the new lines
Or takin' down my number like "you still ain't got a new line?"
Nah it's the same, we've been laborin' for years
I know it took way longer than nine months, but fuck it, it's all in due time
I turned a blunt to a roach with dreams of bein' a Beatle
Don't want to, I need to, ya gotta learn to keep it cerebral
When you come up in a place where everyone got a piece but ain't peaceful
This is just part one, wait 'til the sequel

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Danny Brown]
Comin' from them streets where they thirsty, starvin' to eat
Just a step away from failin', that's why they call it the D
Arguably the whole reason for all of this honesty
Honestly no honor roll, but honored up in them streets
Cause I'm a Linwood nigga, them young niggas hit ya
Put a stack on your head, you'll bleed a lake on Grand River
If you think your hood harder then I might beg to differ
Know some killers pull the trigger for a Swisher and Miller
If the blicka hit your kisser, bet your ass not remembering
They say my city's tougher than two fat bitches scissoring
So nigga I'm a veteran, retire my letterman
Has K's in front ya school, but I ain't going to Kettering
Cough up a lung, 313 where I'm from
Xan got me cross eyed like Bernstein’s son
Any nigga try to copy, put a hole in his top
It's us vs. them, Detroit vs. Everybody

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Lately it seems as if it's me against the world
Like it was before my life became a movie
And they used to use my mothafuckin' trailer to tease me with
But I flipped that script like a refill of
Painkillers to pop the lid off that safety seal
It made me feel amazing, Navy SEAL of bravery
And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script
Ain't bein' conceited
But I made it to radio, eat a dick
I still never ABC'd the shit
Mainstream appeal but the skill is what made me iller
Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla
I was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit
And if I ever end up escapin' these streets I swear that I would stay here still
And if I'm crazy, I'll always be real
Don't make me steal an eighteen-wheeler
Break all of my friends out of here and take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer
Peel off back to the same block that we came from, on a rampage too crazy for me to flip
What's makin' you think I need a switch? Cause I'm Adrian Peterson
When he's raging and heated and on the way to go beat his kid
On a track get spanked like he just did
(DETROIT!) I can't never leave this bitch
Sick of bein' treated like we ain't shit
But Jesus, I can see just why people quit callin' me to do features
And them cyphers on BET cause if I wasn't me
I probably wouldn't want to play with me neither, shit
Seems to be reachin' its fever pitch
One hundred and eighty degrees in here
Shoulder blade full of cedar chips
MCs just bit off more than they can chew like a face full of Swedish Fish
Or Lorena with two penises
Hateful and geniusness inconvenience
And for the record, you don't want this type of static in your life
When I'm makin' you cling to it
May consider tryin' to reinsulate ya windows
May be in for another crazy winter
Cause so cold in the D, it is as days begin to tick away
But ain't this really what made me into the angry bitter blonde
But ain't we sick of bein' underdogs
Don't make me unleash this shit, release this Pit
May even seem as if I'm yankin' your chain a bit
Or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit
Is playin' with you but ain't shit changing
It's still the same shit and Shady's still a lady killer
Since the day I went insane and then attacked the babysitter
With a potato peeler, and mushed her face into the entertainment center
It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again
Or the Bermuda Triangle and attempted to make a safe descent
Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated, it could be danger
Did you make arrangements with the gangsters 'fore you came here?
And if they mention us

[Hook]

[Outro: Trick Trick]
What up though, it's the godfather Trick, Trick
You either ridin' with us or gettin' rolled on
That means Detroit vs. Everybody!!
Hey Em, let me get that instrumental take it down to the hood
Let the little homies get this remix crackin'
Detroit! Okay![Produced by Statik Selektah]

(Capital STEEZ, Rest in peace)

[Intro: Common]
They say signs of the end is near

[Verse 1: Capital STEEZ]
And I quote, we came like them niggas in boats
Still think it's a joke, your third eye vision is broke
We lifted from smoke and floating, that's how I got my aura open
Check the horoscopes, though; you could say I'm horror scoping
You catch me floating on a four-leaf clover
That's the pot of gold so we sonnin' them like Maury Povich
We gone need paternity tests I guess
Cause them vets ain't learning it step-by-step
It's Beast Coast, we the murderous set
We raining fire, and I don't mean the burners and techs
You gotta love it, all 47 of us
You ain't got a number, then I guess we gotta get you covered
I'm connecting to my brethren with the
West side connection cause he say he got the best there
We got the birds like 2-4-7
So I'm a hit you back in a second, cause we already

[Bridge: Capital STEEZ & Joey Bada$$]
Lifted, we lifted, we lifted, you dreamt it
We lived it, we lived it, we lived it, so we already
Lifted, we lifted, we lifted, we dreamt it
We lived it, we lifted

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
Said you could run, but my niggas will still erase ya
Everywhere I go, they just copy and paste us
Pace yourself, wanksta you ain't like that ain't ya? Kerosene for your
Chaser, waste yourself, and thank your boy
Shots on me, I'm not drunk, let me explain my story
I'm not under, I'm higher than who my connect employ
Said for sure he got fire, most dankest, take a whiff
The gracious, he never lace the shit, take a trip
To the astrals, welcome to my land 
It's your first OBE? Tell me how has your body been?
Spinning wheels on the axle of my embodiment, 
Don't waste your breath, you can't BS, we know what your body meant
Through third eye codes, your third eye closed
If Steve Jobs made you purchase a third iPhone
All seeing eyes know what eye means
But 33 degrees can't make us freeze
Said they watered us down so they forced to believe
That they won us through force and greed
Eye said they warning us now so of course they need to be
Wanting a force to lead
They watered us down so they forces believe
That they won us through force and greed

[Bridge: Capital STEEZ & Joey Bada$$]
Said we already lifted, we lifted, we lifted, we dreamt it
We lived it

[Verse 3: CJ Fly]
I'm opening up my chakras; it's potent enough I chop it
I'm pointing out all impostors plotting to block my commas, trying to calm us
Down, but it ain't happening, we mad as shit
Still managing, girl can I bust if I got cannabis?
A half a zip could have her pants unzipped
Ain't enough romantic shit, so don't be sadden if you couldn't have a kiss
I'm still a bastard kid with blackened lips; I'm still a
Pacifist, but if you ask for it, then I could pass a fist
You don't smoke -ism, I'll introduce you, not a buddah
Abuser, feel like a Bad Boy when I take two puffs, I and I
Be stoned so Mary Jane is like Medusa, had keys
For dough, would have thought he was a super, but that's when I grew up
To realize I'm in a place to be
Made vacancy and still the emcee, they know they can't see, we part of the
Resistance, we'll fix things, persistence, we shifting
We drifting, we lifted

[Outro: Nas]
From the spliff that I lift -
From the spliff that I lift -
From the spliff that I lift and inhale[Produced By: Statik Selektah]

[Hook]
What's my name? What's my name?
Badmon
What's my name? What's my name?
Badmon
What's my name? What's my name?
Badmon
What's my name? What's my name?
Badmon
What's my motherfuckin'...

[Verse 1]
Ready to bust my gun, I'm rushin' in like Vladimir Putin
What you want son? Fuck a rou-, let's get shootin'
The 47 Goonz recruitin', join or die
We comin' for groups of guys in suits and ties
Who choose to hide truth from the eye
Grab a white collar by his white evil eye
Fight or flight, yo, that's just what it is
When you see a pig, hit him in his baby back ribs
But don't trip, I'm just another black kid, caught up in the mix
Tryna make a dollar outta 47 cents
Yo, this shit is intense, a dumb cop stoppin' me, probably
Cause he's still livin' in the past tense, how shit was back then
They wanna see the downfall of all black men
And African, I was sent to put action in
But what's new when the po keep flashin' in?
News flash niggas, get a news flash

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
These niggas ain't ready for the war
Know what I'm 'bout, cut the cheddar, close your drawer
Please put your bread up
We ain't gon' settle for no iceberg lettuce
Let us eat when there's war
Or end up like venison meat in the street
They're not ready for beef
Let the fish burn in the pot, niggas all in the spot
When it turns 12 'o clock then, we'll be curvin' the block
Yo cut this shit
Man, I'm the best in the sector
Get your ear buds to grip, then I dissect ya
Inject ya with my lethal weapon
Plant a mine in the deepest section, guess who's least expected
Mothafucka please respect it
The last one to pull my card was easily dealt with
They felt it, the shift, records can't be reckoned with
On tracks wreckin' shit, ask me why I'm reckless
Break a wrist, approach my demo with a risk
Brought my demo listens, I'm a demolition specialist
I got the blueprint to this shit, Jay to the Oh Vee
If Blue was a prince, I'm still Joseph Kony
Niggas know they can't ever little bro me
No matter how big they blow, they still a little below
It's the P-R-O E-R-A, indigo with the killer flow
Guaranteed the realest that you ever saw

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
The badmon young kingpin
I move dope with that ink pen
Been up all night, my third eye ain't even blinking
Fuck what you thinkin'
Number 99, never trust no swine
Lick a shot one time

[Outro][Produced by Statik Selektah]

[Intro]
I want you to tell them
Statik Selektah

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Lets do this man for real
We smoke big blunts, cigars, it's us
It's obvious, kids, we regulate up shit moving through brush
The beats is grim, the ambiance plush
The speaker won't bang, the sneaker won't lust
Snitches wish dead, the eagle gon' bust
Catch you in the wrong spot, you dust
Statik ill, bring the havoc, this is magic
Fake niggas flee out, fly out the mouth, I get you gatted
Sports cars, reendorsed yards
Everybody four stars, Rae like forty, jewelry gaudy
Your creature game corny, I eat your dame, you hop up on me
Head off the rip, grab the whip, rest maturely
Hanging around the vets in the sweats
Since '97 we was rolex-ing the extra
Fuck around a hundred Tecs flash
Flex, cash, drugs, money and sex
Dumb check smashing

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
Watching the game from a bird's eye view
They say it's hard to keep trust so my third eye grew
Chakras open, binocular scoping, sour smoking
Hoping my best buds ain't only in it for the tokens
Cause they say it's who you joking with, tokin' potent with
Tag team and strokin' chicks, the ones that do some bogus shit
Act cool on the strip, but want to put two on your hip
Macking jewels in your whips, booming your hits, screwing your bitch
Froze under my toes, bitches where my penis is
Kicking it since the womb, now you see what the fetus is
And what the fetus is? Would these niggas feed us shit?
Rob a nigga for his number 2's to put my feet in, shit
Flow slippery, rise to the tippity top
I'mma make hot drops, make snakes history
Dreams of living civilly in Sicily
Laughing with a fan like

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
It's the elephant in the room
Created by a collision of the sun and the moon
My sonogram was an image of a gun in the womb
That was soon to be doper than heroin in a spoon
I'm astonishing, honestly my future looking promising
As my skin tone and a crystal clean onyx is
Darker thoughts let the beats break like a Amish's
I'm a stroke of genius like Mickalene Thomas is
Hip-hop and body rocking and doing it dude
I am the living definition of improving the groove
I use the same tools to shoot that Kubrick used
Take your hero to the river, give them two b-rick shoes
Who lose? If you really ain't nobody till somebody love you
I say you ain't nobody til they speaking highly of you
And what I'm sure you wouldn't want is any kind of trouble
Unless you got a crash dummy or a body double
You got a couple homies down to catch a homi- for you
Well I'mma fold niggas into origami for you
The most notorious, Poet Laureate
Whole story is glorious, stoic warriors
And I got my eyes wide open on you quasi-
Haters still smirking like the gators on an Izod
Lacoste, y'all tomato head niggas are
Imposters, long drawn out process
Triple OG's got a worn out conscience
Reminiscing to when we was all out monsters, on
Our Sierra Leone reigning tyranny
I strike fear in their hearts, rappers stear clear of me
Black Sankofa, Ayatollah, Range Rover, games over
Bill folder, give niggas that Ebola virus
Huh? You got me chopped like Miley Cyrus
Naw, I'm on your block with Somali pirates

[Outro]
For real man Statik man, Whats good?
Yeah you know I gets it on
I ain't playin', i'm truly the worst
I was born about that

…Represent me[Produced by Statik Selektah]

[Verse 1]
It's all a hidden  history of mysteries
I see vividly, hysteria
Cause misery on the interior
As shit get more scarier, I'm never in fear
Just a little inferior in some areas
But I share, wisdom with Sumerians
Somewhere we in the place
Peace means harmony, not war and armory
But fuck that, cock your gun back
This survival of the fittest
Some cats get boxed in where they litter
These niggas don't beez in the trap, they like bees in the trap
Get smoked out and I ain't talkin' bout what you toke out
You choked out for really thinkin' that this shit is a silly dream
When actually reality ain't what it really seem
And I ain't actin' on the scene, niggas scream
The actions ain't screened, just well-schemed
I'm tryna' have wealth for my well-being
By eighteen, pockets healthy green
What the fuck is twelve beans?
I need the cake and cream
The stakes is high like feens off a dream jet streaming
Having cuisines with the best seasonings
Its the vets season
Carry a vest, you know the reason
I'm in Chi-raq and I'm getting blown like the breezes
The chicken strip teasers
Thighs, legs and the breast part is the cleavage
She even lick it down to the bone marrow
She in love but I ain't got a bow and arrow
I'm known to jack the booty like I'm Sparrow

[Bridge]
They ain't tryna' see me in the battle
The lines is too narrow
They couldn't even outshine my shadow
They don't want the beef nigga,  let alone the cattle
They just wanna ride the saddle; so sad though

[Hook: Sample]
Black republican, black democrats
Black educator, black entertainer
Black, black businessman, black people Harambee

Save the children (repeated)

[Verse 2]
Okay, they sleeping on the crack, they overdose
Overdose on high fructose, royal toast till I’m overthrown
And over-slowed, I been speakin' over tones
Low but keep them L's high, legends live long
And we gon' be forever, this for the Era
They tried to tell us we too deep in the flow
The mo' the better, the mo' clever, et cetera, whatever
Why do they sweat us?
Dead us, they just met us, but they won't forget us
They don't know better than the worst case
I be headed for first place
Purchase they position cause they worship our position
But I too had no pot to piss in, and so spot on in this instant
And they still ain't got my decision, I won't stand under no man
Except my high supplier, he got the fire, I got the lighter
I hit the spliff and this what I'm spittin'
Like it's gas liquids that I'm drippin', pimpin'

[Hook: Sample][Produced by: Statik Selektah]

[Intro]
I don't give a fuck y'all

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
I've been down but never been out
Around the world since I been out
Now I'm about to fuck around, pull the pin out
Cause kids needs clothes on they back
And daddy need new gold spokes on the 'Lac
Ah- I still posing for flicks holding my dick head
At the table ripping bread with my day ones
Ain't shit change dawg I got the same number
Just a little bit of money and some fame, huh
The hunger stronger than ever
I can taste blood on my taste buds
Holler back at me in eight months
Glowed up like a rave in the forest
In all white eating orange
A beautiful life

[Hook]
It's a beautiful life (x4)

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
The high top Air Force One all canvas
Took those off, hit the stage wearing sandals
Four X white t-shirt, that's standard
And1 shorts, '96 on the camera
Baby got me stiffer than L.A. Looks
So I hit her with that New York dick
Number 3, John Starks on the jersey
Bitch I've been doing this for thirty
The hair on my face says I'm a dominant man with no regards
Catch ya boy on Queens Boulevard
Sunk in the seat of something classic
Sittin' on the floor like a gypsy in a basket
Damn I'm a bastard

[Hook]
It's a beautiful life (x4)

[Verse 3: Joey Bada$$]
The lemon grass in the bally shack
Hit up Chuck, what up I'm on my Cali swag
Cadillac dreams, transactions in between
The man and his cream, every thought brought the penny back
Ballin' off that, yo thanks for the alley act
Probably paint the cut, all black like an alley cat
Middle fingers up
You fuck boys, fucked up
Ya dismissed, had one shot but time's up
Make the block boys go crazy
Take a whiff
Ain't worried about another life
We tryin' to change shift
My reality, life from my ankle ain't actually all you perceive these eyes can deceive
Holdin' back but i'm never holdin' out
So i doubt what ya lil trap mouth chat 'bout
Know they strapped like the back of the couch
We the era, black out on any rat in the house
Smash ya spouse until the cat tap out
Asses out until she passes out
No doubt we gettin' cash now
Use to be class clown
Don't worry about beef
I'm feelin' like a cash cow

[Hook]
It's a beautiful life(x8)

[Outro][Produced by Statik Selektah]

[Skit]
Like "Oh he's broke! I told you he was broke! I told you he ain't got no money", or you know this and that or whatever whatever. Then you'll see some other people, you'll put that you're here in this house, "Oh Joey done made it! He bought a crib! He this, he that". So it's all a story. It's a perception that people make  for you, along the way. So it's not really what it necessarily is at any point or given at time, and that's the thing that concerns me

[Intro]
Break it down
We break it down like
Joey Bad he break it down like
My nigga Fly he break it down like
My nigga Statik break it down like
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
1-2 (x4)
Alright (x4)
Uh

[Verse 1]
First things first is I been rehearsing these verses
In hopes that I hit the surface and keep myself afloat
But I know one day I'm earning me some platinum and some gold
And all them labels could just reimburse this dick in they throat
And tell my mama "Oh no," your purses will never run low
No more cause back when I was four, and we was poor
You would purchase the store
So here I go, your little man has got to grow
I'm walking out the door
My mama just be smiling, cause she know
I got my back, ain't gotta worry
Only thing she ask is that I hurry
Home in time for Christmas for some dinner
"Seen you on TV again, boy you lookin' thinner
But you lookin' like a winner", aye

[Hook]
You got to give to get and then you give back
You got to give to get and then you give back
You got to give to get and then you give back
Then you give back, then you, then you give back

[Verse 2]
Worst thing worse, I could've been stealing your purse
Or just been, putting in work and leaving niggas in the dirt
But ever since birth I knew I would be something on this Earth
So now I spit that dope, that shit be hittin' ya nerve
And to my Papa my word is my bond
When you held me in your arms
Did you know along that a star was born?
Then you named me Jo-Vaughn, now that name ring alarms
Nearly 20 years later we on a plane to The Palms

[Bridge]
I gotcha back, ain't gotta worry
Only thing I ask is for some Curry
Chicken when we land we eatin' dinner
Mama seen me on TV again lookin' thinner
But I'm lookin' like a winner, aye

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take
(x2)
Break it down[Verse 1: Dirty Sanchez]
Dirty Sanchez, and I got dirty presidents
Tell your bitch that we at the back door kicking it
Mix the light of hash with the spliff in it
My lungs are blacker than licorice so they match with my timberlands
Missy didn't hit the L yet but, I'm super duper fly man
Aviators on no helmet
Capital STEEZ helped us formulate a team
Now it's cool all week, 45 to 47 degrees
Fuck school though, them hoes scoot over
95 maxima the new range rovers
It feels like we space traveling
With a eighth and lava lamp, niggas just wishing we'd throw the towel in
Tiedye mental now kill the game we bound to win
Crown and caged we proceed yall pre-game
All our proceeds are sprouting now we reigning
Dirty motherfucker this game what we staining

[Hook: Dirty Sanchez]
And you don't stop it's still 147 on an undercover cop
And you don't stop it's still 147 on an undercover cop

[Verse 2: Rokamouth]
From an AK get em to a motherfucking cop
Fuck is they repping for trying to lock me up for pot
It's too bad that these bullets ain't gon make you niggas stop
Cause the way that they be watching if these faggots want the cock
Why they plot on a nigga? Guess they think I'm selling rock
Cause my knots grown bigger, I'm saving for the top
Just to drop ya'll quicker, fuck what you heard beast coast gon get ya
And when we come get ya bring ya spot on the stretcher
I'm a real hot stepper fighting hard for this cheddar
And only getting better do this shit in any weather
And if you really clever watch your head for your head get severed

[Hook: Rokamouth]

[Verse 3: A La $ole]
As I walk through the streets in the alleys of Brooklyn
Feins is on a scheme mad cops is crookin' you shooken
Just look kid, this ain't your average playground
Bodides in the garbage so them niggas never play round
Just stay down, cause stray bullets might leave your face looking
Destructed, young ruckus can't touch this
Fake MC's, get the ham and no bluffing
They say the kids ill, no I'm fucking disgusting
The bucket brim low, the all black timbos
Wear the lumberjack got a Brooklyn mental
We fresher than mentos, you cats is all weak
Spending heat on momentum never stand on our feet
Each stanza I demand these answers in my hand
Ready for fortune and my times are for grand
Just understand God these streets is murderous
I know you heard of us, you ain't hurting us
It's looking worse for ya, we need a hearse for ya
Better quit while you're ahead or get murked in a
New York minute you'll get smoked like you Newport living
They want beef but MC's only be grillin'

[Hook: A La $ole]

[Verse 4: Joey BADA$$]
Puff puff, pass the dutchy to the righteous man
Heights expand, what we like the contraband
Hit the road with a conscious band
Flow rugged raw shit and
Filled with intoxicants
So the groupie girls pop lock it in
Drop it like it's hotter than tropic land
Tropacan in a can, Cancun on a can am, Dee got the cam
Found yo ex on the beach, yo call me the sandman
Got the queen of dancehall on a handstand
Don't worry bout what car I be in it got your BM in it
Dark tinted, so you can't see him in it
Sharp splinters, told him it'll be a minute
Of blood stains thicker than wood grain
Thinking they would gain but your hood blamed
Production of your environmental conception
Wishin' you was let into which you was not let in
Flourishing through flows that let you hours
True coffee flowers for hours
True MC's they move beef with cowards
Me and Powers discovered our powers when we hit the sours
Word to my brother STEEZ, I pack with the loudest so much green
When we hit spliffs it's like we hit the lotto
That's the lotto cause "Life's a bitch" is still a motto
But that ain't the only reason we get high tho

[Hook: Joey BADA$$]

[Outro]
"Local Hip Hop Group Pro Era 47 insists that they do not spray this graffiti around the neighbourhood, but they do say they designed the image and that is the number 47, they say it's meant to represent peace and balance."[Verse 1]
We smoking and drinking
Me and Statik couple of friends of ours
Scotty, B, O, Easy, Mo and Termanology
The seminar's gotta be hip-hop
I read it in the stars like astronomy, zip locks
But I'm on parole, I can't piss hot
Cause that'll get the kid locked
We talkin bout these rappers
That sold the niggers who shit flop
My shit hot but I never really got a chance to shine
Turn back the hands of time
You can see my plan to grind
I speak to people who struggle
Those are the fans are mine
I tell'em life is a movie
That niggers can't rewind
They love the fact that I spit
With such a ferociousness
Static was the best one
Recording all of my vocal shit
You know the script was freezing
When they was cold as shit
When the time stayed with a runny nose
Cause my coke was my ripped
And niggers know that still
Said I was poor as hell
That's I rap and search vision
Cause I got more to tell
Could it been a offer?
I pull a surprise winner
Instead I hit the block
I was starving to find dinner
Young niggers love the light
Cause in dark you gonna find sinners
On a bed just run in the park
Like I'm Scott Brinner
Cause I'm in a state of mind of a crime committer
You shine and glitter
Talkin greezy behind yo Twitter
I'm on the front lunge of a war
That you can't imagine
Serious shit no jokes
Far from a nigger laughin
We sit back and reminisce
When the game wasn't about silly percentages
I think we should take it back to the genesis
I know all my real niggers remember this

[Outro]
1996
Back up in this nigga
1996[Hook: Styles P]
If you're under 21, you shouldn't listen to this

[Verse 1: Sean Price]
Black folks, crack smoke
Big head scientist, island of Patmos
Fake tears and snakes here
Question my thug cause I ain't shoot a nigga in 8 years
Sets superior imperious rex sket interior airing ya nearing ya death inferior
Listen, it's so thuggish to sniff 'caine
Make me cold-blooded, motherfucker, I'm Rick James
Hell of a drug, Sean Price, hell of a thug
Hang with Sheen, I got elephant blood
Listen to me, y'all better not listen to me
Fuck around and catch a case, trying to be like P
Listen, a ring on you brother, I'm harming you daily
Clown, Ringling Bros and Barnum and Bailey
P, now download this on a disk
If you're under 21, you shouldn't listen to this
Bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Phew, just made the cut baby
Let me light this motherfucking weed I'm smoking
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah
For real
Light the crack pipe so I know it's real

Whoa, young Bill Murray
I'm 21, but I feel 30
A little birdy out in Jersey said my raps were too wordy
Told his bitch to suck my dick and do a curtsy, dirty, slurpy
I smell earthy, puttin' curry on my turkey
I'm Blade 3, you're more Blades of Fury
Blonde dykes love me for my Klondike tummy
Getting all types of money, I'm with Sean Price, dummy, P
Polite stuntin' at a nice white luncheon
Met your wife, pipe plumbing, led to all night humping
Oh no, the end of your life coming
We the tribe, don't make me Phife something
My bitch from Beirut, she get loose
110 proof, call me Zeus, pussy tighter than a wet suit
Jesus Christ, he so nice

[Hook][Verse 1: Ea$y Money]
We go hard when we play the sport
Supreme/sue Preme like we took the DJ to court
You not built for rap, when will you discover?
My dawgs break weed up on your disc cover
Mean rhymes on deck like the dealer's hand
But we still take work out the dealer's hand
This pack a 1000 short, oh you stealing grams?
Some loss happened to grandma, kill a gram/kilogram
Flow butter, your man is on the road
Strapped like Lamar, mean handle on the phone
Don't be flossin' when my clan on patrol
They gon' catch a vic/Vick, animal control
Flow with no pen still eat a nigga writin'
Rhymes sick, these bars need a liquor license
Take shots for the squad you can get the same
Team I'm down for/four like a two possession game

[Verse 2: Scram Jones]
Ayo I used to hold a Visa with no stash
Now I keep my doe up in the freezer, cause all I want is cold cash
Get caught up in agree get your throat slash
But who am I to even teach when I got no class?
From the horses mouth that's why I can't act stable
Just a dog that's known to go and rock a cat's cradle
I'm in Vegas trippin', drinkin' on black label
In the casino slippin', shittin' on a crap table
Oh no habits, Bozo status, bang a Ralph Lauren's daughter on a Polo mattress
I told her, "swallow your pride and suck it up."
And shoot a load to the ceiling, bitch I'm cummin' up
Ain't shit change, beats is steady knockin'
So when chicks give me brain I make sure the heads is bobbin'
Pound the speaker, pounds of reefer
You keep it 100, I keep it 3000, Jeter

[Verse 3: Termanology]
Stat' crazy with the beats, T crazy with the flows
Just like Watch The Throne if Jay and them was broke
We from from the bottom
Yep yep the bottom
Down here where the soil might be
I'm Diallo
Uh
No gun
But they open fire
Uh
So fun
Ralph Lo attire
? is drunk, I'm burnin' tires
Flier than the fliest fly, floatin' through fire
I'm in the Chevy Caprice, with four G's
In the south where I got gone for four Gs/4Gs
Not the phone, I mean four Gs
The only other PR cat or Ortiz
Not Dave or Tito
But I'm the champ
Little water and some trees, I'm the camp
I put my hands in the atmosphere
Showoff laughs some of the best rappers here

[Verse 4: Wais P]
Still nicer than Cam Newton, my man's shootin'
What up rookie, got a whole season you need provin'
What's the reason, spit raps like a nigga teethin'
My right hand asthmatic, leave a nigga weezin'
50 karats on my chest got my nipples freezin'[Mac Miller:]
Hey, hey. . . What up, Term?
Uh-huh. . . and it go like
I'm just gonna let the beat ride out a little bit
You know what I mean?
Just so you can feel what I'm feeling
Alright, now that we on the same page
Alright, look. . . hey, hey

[Mac Miller:]
We be making that classic shit
Rapping on some Statik hits
Immaculate Mac'll spazz and laugh at all these average kids
Be with the baddest bitch
Style's so miraculous
And you heard me spit
But you don't even know the half of it
Keep it funky hungry like I need some money
Cheeky so my speech is funny
Own it like it's bees and honey
Tweedle-dee and dummy
Trying to take some Gs up from me
Yeah they hate me but they love me
I be sillier than putty
Motherfucker, y'all be shapeshifting
Hate spitting, but with them wack bars
Take pictures with 8 bitches, boy we some rap stars
Used to fuck around and just kick it in my backyard
Now I'm on the road, hitting shows with some bad broads
Me and Term be on that hip hop shit
Surprised this young one here know what real hip hop is
Everybody here be like, 'Oh, this my ish'
Hey yo Term, go on kick that shit

[Termanology:]
Listen my mellow the metal will turn you into jello
Claimin' that you peddle with mettle but never in the ghetto
Kill a fellow rapper, immaculate never will I settle
With a middle class budget cause buddy I get the cheddar
Scrape up you amateurs, babble on when I batter ya
Bakin' brownies with hash in 'em, bachelor who be smashin' them
Gucci wallet attractin' 'em hoochies always be flashin' them
Loosies yo I be stackin' 'em so really I'm imaginin'
The wax killer, with Mac Miller my rap's iller
Just ask spitter, for currency I'm a cash getter
I smash Twitter and Facebook, you straight shook
I do a song with you homie and it's a great look
My shotty handle is Armani, they all on me
Call mami and twist her back out like origami
I pour Johnny Walker in my cup
Ever since a little pup
I knew me and Stat was gonna live it up

(Sicker than your average-- who's really the shit?)
(1-9-8-2. 1-9-rhymes-too.)

[Mac Miller:]
I'm better than good it sounds so
Now they mad they hating on him
Girlies be waitin' I'm skating a figure 8 up on 'em
Bitches be making me lemonade and cupcakes
Now you on my dick bitch, tell me how my nuts taste

[Termanology:]
And we like 'fuck jake', trying to get this puff cake
We bad boys for real, homie you trunk space
I'll put a body in a Maserati from the lottie
I'm packing y'all in, a Rottie mixed with the Dalai Lami

[Mac Miller:]
You mad I ain't as lame as you
Eating beats like some Asian food
Flowing that's uncontainable
Rooftop, amazing view
A million rappers in the game but I'mma make it soon
They spending money for me, now I'mma pay for you

[Termanology:]
Squash you like a tomato do
Burners while high will blaze at you
My mami take the pillow and bite it when I be lacin' it
It's undebateable
Roll around with a hater crew
Mac was born in '92 but he rhyme like he from '82

(Sicker than your average-- who's really the shit?)
(1-9-8-2. 1-9-rhymes-too)
(1982, the album coming soon, bitch!)

[Hook: Francesca]
Is it real?
Is it fake?
I woke up, suddenly I just woke up

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Look, yo, it only makes sixth sense
They sleep on the creator of Pineal Gland
No offense taken, I’m just racin’, the savior of man
Crucifix, positive, addition, it’s all the same
Given that getting head is cool, but what is it if you don’t use your brain
That’s one plane, negative subtraction, but still a balance
If dyslexic then play this shit backwards
Uh, the black lip captain of the ship
When you dividing the pie, rats come, it’s all math son
So is it really really real? Or do you need to shapen up my G?
I’m a tree, you know peace be still
The irony of my movement, they eyeing my every movement
The pioneer of the future, another Statik selection
With a dab of perfection
Whether it’s wax in your bong or your eardrum
I’m here now, I’m guessing you live in fear now
So be it, when they speak about the real Soul be it, no debate
Don’t just give ‘em the fish, teach ‘em to fish, let ‘em pro-create Shout out to Joey and ‘em, was dope before the cake
I went from selling records out my record shop
To my record selling out the record shop
That’s a paradox like a pair of yachts

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jon Connor]
It’s hard to be optimistic when Connor’s your opposition
Ain’t no competition, you just a confident contradiction
And what I am in the future, refuse to dispute it
I’ll prove it through music and all you dudes can do is salute it
The most authentic, they get lost in it, I spit raw venom
Jump when I say jump, I feel like Kriss Kross, nigga
Never average, cut from different fabric, fans they never last
My shit’s eternal
Moving so fast that I probably won’t notice a hurdle
Look, Best of the best expect nothing less on my quest
To save the game, I’m walking around like there’s an “S” on my chest
It’s Aftermath out here acting bad, I wave the flag
We the only thing moving, the fuck you go’ say to that?
No lies, all truth, make all you call truce
Watch all just fall off like you tossed off a tall roof
For getting this verse off I paid the cost of the lawsuit
‘Cause I keep hitting them hard with these lines and they all through
Connor

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Logic]
Another day another dollar from that 9 to 5
Yeah, you living but ask yourself, are you really alive?
I worked outside, I worked with food, I worked behind the desk
I’ve even hustled around my block, but hold up, I digress
I’ve paid my dues, see this life I didn’t choose
My face on the ten o'clock news, shit I refuse
I was born in a lower class, where gangsters with dough amass
And police would ask questions, but we never answered when asked
Momma bitching while my sister baby daddy cooking crack in the kitchen
Getting rich in the street from slanging prescription
He showed me how to cook it, he showed me how to cut it
But deep down I always knew that life just wouldn’t cut it
So I started writing, it was a dark time
Only fifteen, but the shit I seen would blow your mind
School was getting harder due to my life at home
Principal always calling ‘cause I had barely shown
No father figure, my mother tried her best to be both
But let’s be honest a father really helps with your growth
But I was raised by Nas and Jay-Z and Big L and Eminem
All of them set examples through they lyrics
Listen close so I could hear it, about life and how not to fear it
How to grab the wheel and steer it, and so I
And so I did just that
Word of advice follow your dreams and never look back
I said it’s Logic

[Hook][Intro]x2
Yo I got guns from Italy, smoke trees considerably
Yo I got slugs for snitches, no love for bitches


[Verse 1: Styles P]
I got a couple of niggas that’ll drop yo body
Ridin in Ferraris and Maseratis
Suits in Dubai and Abu Dabi
Catch em at the juice bar guzzling baji
They can chef it up like Emeril Lagasse
A game when daddy can’t play them posse
Martini and Rossi, asti spumante
You doin the science, I’m a giant just like Andre
Talk about washin the money like it was laundry
Probably smoking a blunt, sippin upon a Don P
Now all these whack rappers is beyond me
And the fact they think they nice; that alarms me
But like alchemist I smoke calmly
The army couldn’t harm me
Kill yourself before you ever think to bomb me
Yea boss of the boss, nigga Don P

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
I got some wild Albanians that come through the block
In some slippers and a jumpsuit and lift off yo top
All maple on the shifter,Armagnac up in the snifter
Catch me in the 5 with the Shiksa
Leather vest with the patches all embroided
I tuck Jackie with the soy milk
Mad ginger before I rap, bunch of joints like a bat rack
You warm pussy and it’s time to take a cat nap
Smoke the catnip, fiends rip the plastic
Hookers getting bread, no G waste band elastic
Talkin business in the bath house
Hilfiger hats rockin stack house
The crib look like Shaq house
Uh, sharp foot like i'm John Bones Jones, kid
Tomahawke chop, red bone in
Grab yo bitch, lay nuts on the ho chin
Only thing for me to do is go in

[Verse 3: Styles P]
I got a couple of niggas that’ll smoke yo boots
Ridin on a train, know they flew in the hoop
Probably in the projects or most of the stoops
You can see em in the juice bar gulping the juice
Motherfuckers will shoot like they playin for doop
Deuces wild get the bricks, throw em off of the roof
Crack pack and yo sneakers are boots
With a gun on yo waist
Keep it movin when police in pursuit
I’m out here in the Jeep ball coupe
About that life
If you ain’t, I ain’t speakin to you
About that mic, SP a beast in the booth
Like I’m indian, I’m the fuckin chief in the booth
Know the difference between a sheep and a wolf
Trade deuce dues dues
You don’t wanna talk shit to a bull
Get yo higher than the first blunt, head in the pool
If your automatics are semi, get a full wuddup?

If you gon' go, darling, go all the way
I wanna see
Listen, baby
If you gon' go, darling, go all the way
I just wanna see, baby

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Step right in, come on down see you's a bad girl
And I'mma put you on your knees then your back girl
I burn you out, I flip you out, I turn you out
And show you 'bout some freaky shit that you ain't never knew about
Yes sir, you know I heard all about you
I'm here to re-route you, need to see what that mouth do
Virgin-a-listic, imperialistic
I got a t-shirt full of your lipstick
Go down, boo, go ahead and kiss it
I'm about to explode don't you miss it
A whole mouth full, don't be scared and don't be bashful
One more question that I must ask you
Do you like or love it when I smash you?
Bring your girlfriends cause you have to
Now go away and get it, now bring it right back, boo
Go

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wais P]
Platform Persians, Panamera swervin'
See a fly bitch, had a Porsche, U-turnin'
Dropping off, picking off, baby, get my digits up
Buy her a Birkin now maybe you can visit her
About to finish her, you fucking free her
I pick her up, switch her to a Benz from a Kia
And I don't need her, I put money before divas
That's how I'm rocking fur, somebody run tell PETA
Who cares? New Airs, Louie loafs for the public
What I rap about I really got, look and judge it
I'm like the Jim Morrison without the chorus in
Type of cat to drink til I black, wake up and pour again
It's war again, Benz 550's what we touring in
If you gon' go then hit the [pole?] and pour it in
It ain't a chore again, it should be natural
Factual, it's like if your money slow, I slap you, ho

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ransom]
I'm pimping without the limp, what's the pasta without the shrimp?
What's the chopper without the inf, never pop up without my mink
It's waist lift, most y'all niggas is straight simps
And I don't deal with change unless it's gon' make sense
I'm finessing this great Bent and I ain't gotta drive it
A million in wardrobe and I ain't got a closet
And we flying private, first class even
Thirst cash season, first class heathens
I'm a violent pimp, I slap til my palm hurt
All you see is some blood, a track and a Converse
A long hearse if you skimming of the top
I'm big pimping like Hov with women on the yacht
Ten linen on the [?], rims spinning on the drop
A hundred on the band, hand spinning on the watch
Clam dinners on the spot, Castellano
Mano e mano, take ten paces, let off a hollow

[Hook][Scratches]:
"Get your two step cause this record of the year"

[Verse One] [Jakk Frost]:
Now you can call me Jakk Frost, Jakk Freezy or Jakk Money
I've been nice since the days of Steady B and Tat Money
I’m half King Kong half Godzilla
They call me half MC, half drug dealer
Half Prince Purple Rain, half Mike Thriller
Half verse killer, half mic killer
I got that Terminator flow, half man half machine
My arsenal is half hand guns, half machine
My team move like half Seals, half Marines
My drug stash Irish, half white, half green
But I’m trying to stay away from my block ways
But nigga I’m a gun, I’m half Megatron, half Shockwave
AK his face while he's locked in a stockade
High speed chase, bout to bust through the blockade
Sell it to him raw, that's what I call a block aid
30 shot clip for the ass, now that's a Glock aid

[Verse Two] [Freeway]:
North Philly maniac
Rep Philly faithfully
Child of the ghetto, man these wicked streets raised me
On top of that, look at what these wicked streets made of me
I'm in all black got my strap on safety
Burners will blast if you try to replace me
I'm in the hood ducking Cagney and Lacey
I'm on the road trying to find me a Stacey
Dash, swoop her up and take her back where my place be
But she never ever relax where the safe be
She climaxed then she's skating
Me, Frost, Tek, we practice cause and effect
Cause we effect every track Statik is making
It's crazy how your favorite girl is my play thing
She's all mouth but never say things
You dugged her out, get her all kinds of jewelry
But when it comes to me she doesn't get a ring
Nah

I pull up in a Shelby
With the young G
First foot out, you see the LV
2G, like the Gucci buckle
Gangster and a gentleman, I rap and I hustle
Plus, I love the block I grew up on
Walk down the same block I drove the Porsche on
Black and yellow diamond no Steeler fan
I live Jet life, move Giant grams
See the wrist, got a B and a wing on it
Every track that I touch, do my thing on it
Plus, little nigga with a complex
Better take me serious like a bomb threat
Yeah, I'm the one that you love to hate
Nigga With an Attitude, N.W.A
In other words that you can understand
Plain and simple I'm a bad bad man

I've been in this game for years, it made me an animal
I've been in this game for years, it made me an animal
I've been in this game for years, it made me an animal
I've been in this game for years, it made me an animal
It's rules to this shit

[Intro]
Yea enough respect
The Bad Boy, Death Row, No Limit
Rap-a-lot, Roc-a-Fella, Cash Money, Ruff Ryders
So So Def, The Inc
And all the incarcerated Scarfaces from ghetto to ghetto
Now introducing to you a new empire
Quiet Money Records and Hush Management
Formely presents, yours truly

[Verse 1]
I'm praised for wicked word-play
Emerge from my herb days
Was boxed in the Bird Cage
Now flock with the Mermaids
A shorty wop, til I copped then I turned age
Saw it unfold, certain wars is untold
Unsolved Mysteries, coffins is closed
A carnivore trickery, caution your role
Any slip-ups will be haunting your souls
So neva get it twisted nigga, keep an iron biscuit witcha
Beast promoted, the street's is coded
For the naked eye times is too deep to notice
Yea I specialize in rhymes, but I peep the bogus
On every known level, I'mma stone cold rebel
Clothes is crisp, I rolls gold the wrist
I was schooled how to tuck, hide and hold the fifth
How to crush, cut, divide and supply the sniff
So if the truth ain't me, then the truth can't be

[Hook]
[Notorious BIG] I've been in this game for years, it made me an animal

[BIG] I've been in this game for years, it made me an animal

[BIG] I've been in this game for years, it made me an animal
[Pro] I'm falling and I can't turn back

[Verse 2]
From base potter to that hard rock white
We all hustlers, live that hard knock life
Some get knocked, and their heart's not right
Cuffed up in the AM, met this charge that night
We all know that the Narc's ain't nice
But that's the price when your bars ain't tight
The beast within release within, you get caught-up lose trust
You don't speak to friends, you lose lust
Rarely fuck, you just seeking sin
You know thugs stay grizzly and love to get busy
The stakes is high, the bids is long
A few wakes niggas cry, you live, you gon'
If you escape, rules apply, kids is born
And the game won't change, it's the same ol' thang

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
And my mind been backwards since puffing on them back-woods
Stressing on them clappers, and ducking from them crackers
Neva been in Napa, neva fuck wit no Rappers
I'm so gon' wit it, but I'm so long winded
Seen the worst, when I seen my first
Body get caught, I was prolly this short
The victim right beside me, stressed on the sidewalk
But you neva seen a man cry, 'til you seen a man die
The killer shots, the realer the guap
If you gorilla, then it's similar plots
Then if not, you more familiar, you a squealer
You no dilla you hot, fuck around get the whole block locked
But neva me, I've been Boss playing, cooking up sautéing
Til I saw another door, I had to force a nigga way in
Now in all Black wit the gloves and hat
I'm so deep in it, that I can't turn back

[Hook]"Coming From Queens" *scratching*

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]

Yo
Light the leaf, lay sugar sweet
Inhale the mystic
The three shells by the toilet
I'm futuristic
I'm so ridiculous, my mental sickness-
Women, love a light skinned brown with lots of thickness
A Queen's thing, no shoes in the tatami room
Legs crossed sipping hot sake
Big drugs like a sushi roll
She see the cops, throw the drug up in a poopy hole
Plus she steered the coupe
Eyes shining like diamonds
Smiling like new veneers
Fuck her once, left a souvenir
Plus she take it through the rear door
I watched her change
Now she balling, got a clear floor
Halibut seared off
I'm not impressed though
Cigar full of pesto
Smoking rings, linen from Ernesto
Straight from Queens where it's wise to wear a vest, bro
We blowing up in the world, i'll never let go

[Hook]

"Coming From Queens" *scratching*
It's a Queen's Thing (3x)

[Verse 2: Kool G. Rap]

The streets know how I get down
I bang these weaponry
So think "before I let go"
Like Frankie Beverly
Yeah, I creep with your wife, kid
Her brain be heavenly
Dribble on my balls so crazy
Her game need a referee
Come and run to me and complain
Lean my press and squeeze
I hit your frame
Till you're shit stained and wet with pee
I'm a loose shooter
The color of the coupe puter
Stewardess on the dick on a plane to Aruba
Introduced her to the mile high club and scooped her
Told the bitch that I'm the QU Larry Hoover
I run things in the sewers
With flames from the Rugers
Keep heat like saunas
Crimes for the drama
With body armor up under Louis Vuitton farmers
Still trapped in the 80's, Dapper Dan crazy
Tan Mercedes, whip it past the traffic jam, baby
Hundred grand wrapped in rubber bands
Niggas straight cheese
It's me

[Hook]Chorus
Are we almost there yet yeah, are we almost there yet?
Are we almost there yet oh oh oh oh, Are we almost there yet oh, are we almost there yet?
Are we almost there yet oh oh oh oh

Verse 1
I've been trying to live out all my dreams, when will they come to life oh
They seem so vivid when I go to sleep, when I wake up they call on me, oh yeah yeah yea
Said I been traveling far, but I'll make it there,
I been there from the start, life ain't always fair.
I'll never fear the road down, if I could make it here I'll make it anywhere.

Chorus
Are we almost there yet yeah, are we almost there yet?
Are we almost there yet oh oh oh oh, Are we almost there yet oh, are we almost there yet?
Are we almost there yet oh oh oh oh

Verse 2
Yo, life's a kaleidoscope chopped with a lot of hope I sit and rhyme when I think about my obstacles
Hey mom look at me now the kid is on the rise and he's making you proud,
I got a half a million dollars at the age of twenty two, I thought my life was set, I guess it wasn't true
But now I'm twenty three trying to make it back to school but I never graduated so they calling me a fool,
Yeah I'm turning bronze to a lot of gold, I'm feeling like Lebron when he got a gold
Statik play the record so they hear what I say, I'm from New York but I'm headed west no Kanye
With a back pack if my fans talk then I chat back and I bogart like the rat pack
No I won't stop till I'm that cat, I'm no one they could compare yet, but I still ask myself are we almost there yet?

Chorus (x2)
Are we almost there yet yeah, are we almost there yet?
Are we almost there yet oh oh oh oh, Are we almost there yet oh, are we almost there yet?
Are we almost there yet oh oh oh oh

Are we almost there yet yeah, are we almost there yet?
Are we almost there yet oh oh oh oh, Are we almost there yet oh, are we almost there yet?
Are we almost there yet oh oh oh oh[Scratch Hook]:
"Limos, arenas and TV shows
Autograph pictures and classy hoes"

[Verse One]
I scribe my life on border lines before the rhymes
I thought of dime chasin', mind racin'
Off the fine wine agent inauguration
Of a poet
Laureate, my story yet
To meet the apex they say Reks the whole east best
They say that s-t-a-t-i-k
The greatest of the DJs
Producer brother truest in the beautifulest decay
And we say, we took it from the ghettos to arenas
Found our heaven in between us
Seamless scene of dreamers
The team in position, powerful autograph and taking pics
Groupies front row turn to Marriott making flicks
Amazing this in making a matrix is bound to wake to this
The patience is a virtue, burst through the waiting list
Graveshifting it just to make difference
Just to make the distance in us and them significant
From Paris in my cinnamon's lavish living the benefits
Sincerely all keep it one and all on the trips with us

[Verse Two]:
I'm doing rhymes now, bye bye to crimes now
Come on the ave, I'm real hard to find now
Doing arenas in Athena and I know you seen us
At every festival, fans put us on pedestals
Packing metal's forgettable when you've mastered a better flow
Of income, and then some, now here come the effin' hoes
I went from ashy to classy
Shorty asked me to sign her double D's overseas
To add these foreigners that we're performing for to our conglomerate
We prominent we jammin' it, profits from the rhyming shit
Shorty it's an honor to be on the dick of someone so notorious
We worshiped as a don of spit
Pondered if I chose another route, bowed out
Took the safer role punch a clock instead of blazing shows
Doubt for the the nonbelievers all I believe is from the ghetto
To the arena, sky's the limit for the big dreamers
Word up

[Verse Three]:
And we our hometown royalty
All you see is the red carpet for the progress
God bless to y'all who stuck with us through the process
Of course it's not all flawless
Evil forces want to see us falter
Separate as we divorce ya
And I don't fault ya
Father forgive him for not feeling the roster
The rawest since Rawkus before it lost its luster
I feel like Busta Leading The New, feeding them food
Even through the meaningless Stat and Reks is meaningful
Breezing through cities the allure and it's all a blur
All occur cause we keep it true, say they seeing you
What's been missing as we sitting on a dynasty
Rap minus me at negative one, honestly
Rap minus Stat, just wack each track crack
East coast can kick you're feet up, cause we back
Straight, No Chaser make those papers for those acres
Build your bucks to break up, let's cake up
Wake up

[Hook]
I’m coming back to you
I’m coming back to you
I’m coming back to you
God willing, I’m coming back to you

[Verse 1: Rakaa]
Passport, atlas, memories in the stamps
Seat melts to a mattress, visas when we land
Caravans all access, seeing what we can
Foreign hands, foreign cameras hanging out of black vans
We’re gone, live where the bottom of the L
Links the middle of the A from the middle of LA
Riddle wrapped in enigma, the puzzle, who wanna play?
The pressure on, a hair trigger away, away
Surfing through jetstreams, swimming through information
Cannot find the bankers or the politics in nations
Higher than medication, exercise the meditation
I see it’s really all depending on what you have faith in
Killer instinct, savior complex
They here to save the world, but who want test?
Keep it live every second, the time given
Might live with regrets, but I bet I won’t die with them

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Evidence]
Uh, so check it out, this the voice of a thousand shows
Nice to meet you, where you seated? I could see it though
Without a doubt this the only life I’ve ever known
I spit that shit in return, I watch the liars glow
Stand up, we turn it up, just a little more
Superwomen flying in and out of everywhere I go
Different face, same drama, withdrawal
I ain’t leaving 'til I find my high and my setting is low
I’mma cut out the additives
The women I attract, majority weren’t graduates
These are the cards dealt, change the outcome
I ain’t tryna change clothes, I rearranged my game though
Be about some shit, that ain’t me to back [?]
Dilated, day one, we worked the angles
I’m coming back, not ‘til bread is in the basket
Travel with my carry-on, marijuana plastic

[Hook] (x4)Oh babe (Statik Selektah) Oh oh oh, yeah yeah yeah
(Dj Scratches)
Ladies and gentlemen, and now to the stage
Live from New York, here we go

[Verse 1]
You could take, all of your shit and just pack up what you brought
Cause there ain't room anymore, I can't keep your baggage for sure, (you)
You could fake, you're not in love but we both know that you are
But you won't stay for long, cause I can't keep your baggage no more, oh oh oh

[Chorus]
You claim that you don't know
But there's no doubt about it
You never leave home without it oh oh no

You're better off on your own
Ain't no way around it, it's not the way we found it oh oh no

[Verse 2]
You could be, as bitter as you want
About how things are
I told you straight from the start, I can't keep your baggage for sure
Uh, yeah
Can't believe, that I would actually
Give you what you want oh oh
Cause there ain't room anymore, I can't keep your baggage no more oh oh oh

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Michael Christmas]
(Laughs)
She high fashioned, low maintenance, no patience, hate waiting
Stay in Vegas, hate to bake shit, love debatin she be praying
Call me Satan, love to stay in (Booo)
Told me get your shit out, then she called her cousin damn I think she put a hit out
Wish I had a team, I could probably sell the bitch out
Thinking I be dreaming get behind her then I pinch (Ouh)
Said girl what happened? They be kicking flavor in your ear Craig Mackin
Too many games like back to back and
Sitting in my underpants that's the captain
Morgan endorsing, Love Michael Kors, don't believe in divorcing, hate doing chores
Think I'm Blake Griffin say I'm dunking all the whores
I say why you crazy, who done fucked up all your doors?
Said you call on top row, tell em he could come get your shit
And then I called up your phone, just to tell you I miss you[Produced by: Statik Selektah]

[Intro]
I don't give a fuck y'all

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
I've been down but never been out
Around the world since I been out
Now I'm about to fuck around, pull the pin out
Cause kids needs clothes on they back
And daddy need new gold spokes on the 'Lac
Ah- I still posing for flicks holding my dick head
At the table ripping bread with my day ones
Ain't shit change dawg I got the same number
Just a little bit of money and some fame, huh
The hunger stronger than ever
I can taste blood on my taste buds
Holler back at me in eight months
Glowed up like a rave in the forest
In all white eating orange
A beautiful life

[Hook]
It's a beautiful life (x4)

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
The high top Air Force One all canvas
Took those off, hit the stage wearing sandals
Four X white t-shirt, that's standard
And1 shorts, '96 on the camera
Baby got me stiffer than L.A. Looks
So I hit her with that New York dick
Number 3, John Starks on the jersey
Bitch I've been doing this for thirty
The hair on my face says I'm a dominant man with no regards
Catch ya boy on Queens Boulevard
Sunk in the seat of something classic
Sittin' on the floor like a gypsy in a basket
Damn I'm a bastard

[Hook]
It's a beautiful life (x4)

[Verse 3: Joey Bada$$]
The lemon grass in the bally shack
Hit up Chuck, what up I'm on my Cali swag
Cadillac dreams, transactions in between
The man and his cream, every thought brought the penny back
Ballin' off that, yo thanks for the alley act
Probably paint the cut, all black like an alley cat
Middle fingers up
You fuck boys, fucked up
Ya dismissed, had one shot but time's up
Make the block boys go crazy
Take a whiff
Ain't worried about another life
We tryin' to change shift
My reality, life from my ankle ain't actually all you perceive these eyes can deceive
Holdin' back but i'm never holdin' out
So i doubt what ya lil trap mouth chat 'bout
Know they strapped like the back of the couch
We the era, black out on any rat in the house
Smash ya spouse until the cat tap out
Asses out until she passes out
No doubt we gettin' cash now
Use to be class clown
Don't worry about beef
I'm feelin' like a cash cow

[Hook]
It's a beautiful life(x8)

[Outro][Hook x2]
New York, New York
Big city of dreams
New York, New York
In the hood they love us
New York, New York
Big City
New York, New York
New York is still the same

[Verse 1: Troy Ave]
The name's Troy Ave, I'm about my ones
If niggas want static, I select my guns
Got a ACP, that's for burgularing
And a .38 Speez, that's for murdering
?, I'll take your life
But I'm giving out the raw at a takers price
I shake the dice with my freedom and yikes
Nightmare on fed street, I get the chills at night
Chinchilla on the ground, furthermore I'm around
All the bullshit at parties, Biggie don't make a sound
(Shhhhh!) That's a moment of silence
Loud pack, loud gats, here go the violence
Just another day in the hood, what the fuck
I'm busy selling yay in the hood, getting bucks
Milwaukee on 'em, fuck that get New Yorkie on 'em
A little dog food, dope swag shawty on 'em

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Push!]
I ain't have to ride a nigga coattails
I came up off a crack rock and coke sales
New York City, I'mma restore order
Cause most these rap niggas is suckas and whore [orders?]
Bunch of suckas for love, I put on the glove
And picked up the Snub, and started shooting, fuck is the love
It ain't none, cause most of these lame niggas is faggots
Bunch of my sons, I need to claim 'em on taxes
Since it been a war on drugs, it been a war on me
The pigs don't want me bringing bacon home apparently
I'm Dorner of the corners
Sending all the formers to the coroner
Counting drug money is euphoria
Started out selling nickels
Just to get a fistful
Now it's 600 every fiscal
Still distribute yay like Def Jam
And I still will shoot hoops through ya chest man

[Hook]

[Verse 3: AG da Coroner]
I'm the epitome of everything that the city is
My team is official while you run with them idiots
Couple years back, wasn't taking it serious
Got my mind right, now the buzzing is furious
Attitude rude like a chick on her period
Red leather jacket, Eddie Murphy Delirious
Big names looking at me, niggas is curious
Don't trust a soul, mama raised me delirious
Found a good wifey, little baby the prettiest
The place where I'm from made me one of the grittiest
The hand we were dealt, it was one of the shittiest
I'm ill with the words nigga one of the wittiest, fuck with me
Get found slumped in the tub like Whitney
Africa spears hit you, the Black Britney would clap with me
Stand in front of the court and bring Shaq with me
Scrap with me, brought them Corleone contracts with me

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Meyhem Lauren]
Cocaine champions, Kelly K companionship
Charismatic with my fabric, flowing like my hammer spit
Fully auto, raw blow, watches from [Torno?]
Everything's the same, it's not a game, just now we tour though
Double shine, overtime grind, we getting more dough
Still smack 'em in the face and choke 'em out to let a nigga know
I put my fucking hands around your neck just like a figaro
Hard body everything, bought the block a wedding ring
I'm in love with this lifestyle, entice wild
Fuck them, I'm living it right now, we might smile
But ain't shit comical, moving economical
Loyal to the man that's in the mirror cause I honor you
Thinking crazy, being on point, that's what the drama do
If I don't hit ya face then I'mma touch something abdominal
Nothing's accidental, execute and plan wins
Cause everyday I'm tryna get a new buck like tan Timbs
Laurenovich[Reks-Verse 1]
I wanna travel the world
Lace my wife with the diamonds and pearls
My mom with a crib
So she can live in peace she deserves
Give my son Zeke everything I missed as a youth
So every time I get in the booth
I rap with a focus
Rats and the roaches
No more of that
More like plaques and awards
It’s the new prognosis
Ride or die ? always said you the dopest
And I know this so I’m aiming at the game like coaches
Pain had us hopeless
No more living broke like as hobos
We building like Legos the logos
Show-o-double ff (showoff)
Reppin’ M-A-double S (Mass) like a Malolm X out of jail photo
By any means necessary
Green’s the itinerary
Lawtown scene and the dream’s to be rich, you ready?
Well live it up, fill the cup, make a toast
All my niggas know that victory’s close
Held your head if ya…

[Hook]
Big dreamers, we all seem to be big dreamers
Wanted it all, oh we wanted it all
Cause, we big dreamers
When me and my homies were small we kept our eyes on the mall
Big dreamin’ til my rims spin
And my swag right
Cause my gear fresh
And mom’s got a crib of her own
Shit I’m grown, so I’m gonna keep big dreamin’ I got gots to get it

[Termanology Verse 2]
It’s all-scientific
Mystic, you know the earth and the stars
Don’t hesitate to say heard of the law
We the boys from the north
When Krumb put me on, I was under 21 with a gun in my palm
But that was way back
Wishin I had a starter jacket
In the part of Bradford Street where the crack heads were on the corner clappin’
Before the I-Tunes, I was high-noon
With my Ice-Cube tape bangin’ at the loudest vol-ume
Had to defend mine, without seeing Fed-time
Member when I told my momma, I ‘ma make it big time
That’s when I made up my mind, I was big dreamer
Aim for the sky, label guys gonna feed us
Caviar and such, now we on the bus
Perion and cuffs?
Cali in the dutch
We on a world tour
I’m so proud of myself, I seen the big picture
IMAX theatre, ology, I was a big dreamer

[Hook]

[Krumbsnatcha-Verse 3]
The million dollar man, call him K-Dibiase
OT the ice man, a rap’s Liberace
Frost bit, three hundred thou for some car shit
Still underground, get the hoodies for the mosh pit
That’s just a dream now, but it’s like a part of me
Escape mental poverty, now its like monopoly
On my mind constantly
Out for the property
? Money and vision is missing properly
And I’m a work til the good lord bury me
Give back to charity, manifest prosperity
And nothing change when there’s money to burn
Just be stunnas with the young gunnas Reks and Term
It started from a dream on the corner just rapping
But now we hard to find like Osama Bin Laden
Dreams now materialized, ain’t no surprise
From the bottom to the top, seen the family rise

[Intro]
I want you to tell them
Statik Selektah

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Lets do this man for real
We smoke big blunts, cigars, it's us
It's obvious, kids, we regulate up shit moving through brush
The beats is grim, the ambiance plush
The speaker won't bang, the sneaker won't lust
Snitches wish dead, the eagle gon' bust
Catch you in the wrong spot, you dust
Statik ill, bring the havoc, this is magic
Fake niggas flee out, fly out the mouth, I get you gatted
Sports cars, reendorsed yards
Everybody four stars, Rae like forty, jewelry gaudy
Your creature game corny, I eat your dame, you hop up on me
Head off the rip, grab the whip, rest maturely
Hanging around the vets in the sweats
Since '97 we was rolex-ing the extra
Fuck around a hundred Tecs flash
Flex, cash, drugs, money and sex
Dumb check smashing

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
Watching the game from a bird's eye view
They say it's hard to keep trust so my third eye grew
Chakras open, binocular scoping, sour smoking
Hoping my best buds ain't only in it for the tokens
Cause they say it's who you joking with, tokin' potent with
Tag team and strokin' chicks, the ones that do some bogus shit
Act cool on the strip, but want to put two on your hip
Macking jewels in your whips, booming your hits, screwing your bitch
Froze under my toes, bitches where my penis is
Kicking it since the womb, now you see what the fetus is
And what the fetus is? Would these niggas feed us shit?
Rob a nigga for his number 2's to put my feet in, shit
Flow slippery, rise to the tippity top
I'mma make hot drops, make snakes history
Dreams of living civilly in Sicily
Laughing with a fan like

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
It's the elephant in the room
Created by a collision of the sun and the moon
My sonogram was an image of a gun in the womb
That was soon to be doper than heroin in a spoon
I'm astonishing, honestly my future looking promising
As my skin tone and a crystal clean onyx is
Darker thoughts let the beats break like a Amish's
I'm a stroke of genius like Mickalene Thomas is
Hip-hop and body rocking and doing it dude
I am the living definition of improving the groove
I use the same tools to shoot that Kubrick used
Take your hero to the river, give them two b-rick shoes
Who lose? If you really ain't nobody till somebody love you
I say you ain't nobody til they speaking highly of you
And what I'm sure you wouldn't want is any kind of trouble
Unless you got a crash dummy or a body double
You got a couple homies down to catch a homi- for you
Well I'mma fold niggas into origami for you
The most notorious, Poet Laureate
Whole story is glorious, stoic warriors
And I got my eyes wide open on you quasi-
Haters still smirking like the gators on an Izod
Lacoste, y'all tomato head niggas are
Imposters, long drawn out process
Triple OG's got a worn out conscience
Reminiscing to when we was all out monsters, on
Our Sierra Leone reigning tyranny
I strike fear in their hearts, rappers stear clear of me
Black Sankofa, Ayatollah, Range Rover, games over
Bill folder, give niggas that Ebola virus
Huh? You got me chopped like Miley Cyrus
Naw, I'm on your block with Somali pirates

[Outro]
For real man Statik man, Whats good?
Yeah you know I gets it on
I ain't playin', i'm truly the worst
I was born about that

…Represent me"Black cream"

[Hook] [Big Shug] (Reks)
From chains to whips
To chains and whips
Hopped off the slave ships into the fly kicks
Floss our ice, gettin' paper
All my niggas want paper
We just gotta get paper
(We bought your American Dream
The negro epidemic, black cream)
Black cream

[Verse One] [Reks]
Dear Oprah Winfrey
I know misogyny
Is rampant in our music and it pains you severely
But Dear Ms. Billion Dollar Income
Hear me
The path to success isn't merely:
Respect self, sincerely, remember Celie?
Slaved after mister
And when she disobeyed then he whipped her
Well we was picked up, broke down, whipped up
Said, "Thanks" to master when he tipped us
Upon tree, lift us
Noose as a necktie
Excuses, I guess I
Use cause I refuse to let my
Ego be abused by the stereotype
That blacks just might be better off as have nots
Than to have cops, harass us
Poor Jacqueline Onassis
Husband gunned down, supporting our black asses
We as poor folks frown upon a brother's success
The more he has, then we have less
And we have yet, been able to afford
Without buying the store
Instead of repair, get all the white Airs
Force 1/one to look in the mirror
And be ashamed as the truth appears
Nigga, negro, Afro, hero
To the youth who want to rhyme for deniro
And shine like them joints in the earlobes
The pain I've seen
Watchin' my people spend they black cream

[Hook] [Big Shug] (Reks)
From chains to whips
To chains and whips
Hopped off the slave ships into the fly kicks
Floss our ice, gettin' paper
All my niggas want paper
We just gotta get paper
(We bought your American Dream
The negro epidemic, black cream)
Black cream

[Verse Two] [Reks]
Everybody ain't Kanye West lord
I tell the kids, get a dream you can afford
But kids want stunts, smoke blunts and impress broads
Sip on syrup cause they idol got his cup
What this does
Is make it harder to give a fuck
The impulse
To ball got Cosby pissed off
That "buck that bought the bottle
Coulda struck the lotto"
To invest in scratch tickets is a fucked up motto
Dress our autos, barely dress our kids
Some want Tims, but he gon' wait
Daddy need new rims
Damn
Did I write that right?
Question is
Are you gonna right that wrong?
Put my mic back on
Free speech is tell a nigga 'bout a nigga's self
You poor knowledge even if you got dumb wealth
Poor knowledge?
Dumb wealth?
All the money in the world, your black ass can't spell help

Chains and whips to chains and whips
Right into the latest kicks
And we
Floss our ice
Brush off haters
Black man's plight
Lusting paper
(We just gonna get paper)
We bought your American dream
The negro epidemic, black cream
(Black cream)
"Black cream"

[Big Shug singing]
Heeeey
Stay on your grind baby
Brush off the haters
Remain a player
Gettin' this paper
Black cream, yeeeeah
Black cream, yeeeeah
Gettin' this paper
Gettin' this paper
Black cream

[Outro] [Big Shug talking]
Big Shug. Reks. This is how we get down man
Cats is fightin' for money out there
We gotta keep it movin' man. One way or the other. I'm out
