[Pre-Hook & Hook][Tyga: Verse 1]
Fuck that, fuck shit pay me

Don’t be fuckin wit a young nigga

No deciding, just a silence
On the sizzle, P90
Kill yourself like you're in college

Cash money party, guess you broke niggas ain’t invited
Got a bad bitch riding

We a little too young
Little too dumb
Maybe just a little too sprung

Cause baby I know getting rich with you'd be fun
But right now, right now gon' throw these ones
You know I'm with it, ima throw me some
You run around with your homies
But just remember you my only one

If a bitch fuck around, I'mma go off
My advice is she better get on the go
You came to shop at the mall but I bought the stores

Got the cop to go, as my pockets grow
Check the chains and the rings and the watches bro
And I boxed a slut, I just boxed a ho
You tryna pass me bitch? It ain't possible, nah

Me and you against the world, girl
All we gotta do is be

Me and you against the world, girl
All we gotta do is be

We ‘bout to run the world, girl
All we gotta do is be

[verse 1: apl.de.ap]
She got me swingin’ that gorilla shit
Beatin’ my chest
We go hard like a militant
Breakin’ a sweat
She keeps me sharp as a razor blade
Fits like she tailor made
Fresh enough to be my main squeeze
Sweet as lemonade

Hourglass shape
Got me fallin’ like a fade away
Together we just cock back
Aim and blow the hate away
What can I say?
She pulls my heart
Like a hand grenade
We on the move, spread the word
Like its marmalade
She got me revved up, hot
Like a motor bike
Love like a G650
She my prototype
This ain’t your average blasé blah
We hit em’ hard
Baby, tell them what’s up
Sing it J

[hook/Chorus: Jessica Reynoso]
Just let your imagination run free
Its you and me
All we gotta do is just be
The world's in the palm of our hands
We don’t need no plans
You can let your spirit just be
A little time is all you’ll need
So your soul can breathe
All you gotta do is just be
All we gotta do is just —
All we gotta do — (all we gotta do is just be)

[verse 2: Honey Cocaine]
All you gotta do is just be
Why you wonderin' and worryin' 'bout things on you and me, see
Breathe a bed
Baby close your eyes, release
Pass the keys, freeze
Watch me let my hair down in the breeze
Is you down to smoke a pound? (slow it down)
Let's hit the road, to the other side of town
These golden sounds
From a queen, baby
They know me, I control the scene, baby
Don’t pay attention to my ex
He’s a fiend, baby
Ay
I came here alone, so if you riding, better ride
Forget my fame and my throne
Uh
But if you're tryna to play a game, then its on
Bet I can win your heart, for now
Just put your name in my phone
Uh

[hook/Chorus repeats]

[verse 3: apl.de.ap]
What can I say
Her love bites like a gator
She stares right through me
Like her eyes’ made of lasers
None could ever fade us
We the ‘livest and the greatest
My girl is rock solid
While your girl’s made of paper
And you haters at the gate
Just so amazed at how we made it
We up the elevator, no roof
See ya later
We stay up in the status
We the baddest of the baddest
We could be whatever baby, like
[Honey Cocaine] poof, cause its magic

[apl.de.ap] The team is so supreme
[Honey Cocaine] I be the queen, you be the king
[apl.de.ap] Spark me up and light me up and watch me blow like gasoline (ya know whadda mean?)
This isn’t your average blasé blah
We going hard, baby tell 'em whats up
(what’s up?)

I stay smoking raw, organics
Like a chainsaw, trees vanish
Tell me your name, so I can forget it
I'm in the fast lane
And you at the exit

Blow past you bitches
While you blow for riches
I ball hard like bitches
You holding on like stitches
I'm taking off, no glitches
You behind me like hitches
Stay grinding like bitches
In the eye lens like snitches

Keep it clean, like it's my parents
This my life, so you can stop staring

[Verse 2:]
8 ball of the dust, you rap bitch is rust
You hoes talk too much, the reason I don't trust
My career my main concern, shut the fuck up it ain't your turn
Humble last kid I came to learn
But I'll smack a ho, if she claim my words
I'm about these commas bitch period
So don't ask me why I'm so serious
50 fuckin K is what my earrings is
If you hatin you can exit at the nearest shit
It ain't no joke fam, growing up my broke fam
Ain't even have no Christmases, so I tolerate from no man
Who knew the little girl woulda hang, bitch
In and out of school and still manage to slang bitch

So pussys got poked and pussys got popped

Tell this bitch I swerve
Every thot nigga gettin' curved
That niggas the worst
Can't buy my trust with a perf
Got to learn to swim
Before you surf
Put it on a turf
These motherfuckers got nerve
You can get murked on the curve
Dont be actin absurd
I ain't even saying no words
I just do my thing like like
Pussy ass nigga with a stank breath
Spendin all your money on hoes
Ain't got a thang left
You weak niggas on the same flex
And them boys get swerved
Cause I just can't stress
And your girl whip
Tryin to split game
Actin all crazy for some champagne
You at the club in the same outfit
Came with the same loud b**ch
Niggas ain't about shit

(chorus)
Nigga gettin' on ya nerve
Kick his ass with a curve
Hit his ass with a curve
Tell that bitch nigga swerve
Kick his ass with a curve
Hit him fast with a curve
Curve
Fuck,fuck
Tryin to talk, that's a curve ball
He dont stop
Throw a curve ball
You can get it dropped by a curve ball
I hit his ass with this curve ball

(Verse 2)
You know the motto
Honey never fall in love
Especially not no Motherfuckin' scrubs
Lead me to the block
But you don't be tryin holla fo' no love
Motherfucker I'm not dumb

You fuckin' with me tryna get dome
Money never sure stay long nor love
Tell me am I f**king wrong?

Thats the worse, worse
All them bad bitches say it war ,war
Curve, curve, curve, curve
Swerve, switch lanes and I ditch his ass
Like I ain't wearin' my retainer I shift his ass
Now we trippin I ain't hittin' em back
Tell the fuck boys style we ain't gettin' attached

(Chorus)

You ain't get dropped with a curve ball
I hit his ass with this curve ball
Curve,curve, curve
Curve,curve, curve

(Chorus)[2Pac:]
"...and I feel like if you walk by a street and you was walkin' on concrete and you saw a rose, growing outta concrete
Even if it had messed up petals and it was a little to the side you would marvel at just seeing a rose grow through concrete.."

[Honey Cocaine:]
As a yougin' all I had was a dream
Rappin' to myself as my mama used to scream
Papa getting violent and he beatin' her again
They just feeling stressed cause they tryna pay the rent

Papa, you a G though you did wrong
Mama, you an angel cause you stayed strong
Papa, it's alright, we have weak moments
Mama, you a soldier cause you keep holdin'

Uh
But some days, we ain't have shit
And some nights, I was askin'
"Why we so poor, but my friends not?"
Just jealous of what my friends got

Uh
I was hungry and you fed me love
Damn, you gave me yours, it wasn't enough
Yet, I took it all and without a praise
You made it feel like home and without a place
Workin' like slaves, and I'm so sorry
Ungrateful for the things you done did for me
Comin' home from school, disrespecting
Acting like I ain't have blessings
Dear, Mama the council won't get you
If you try to go, I won't let you
A careless ass kid, but I'm tryna change it
I just need to tell you I appreciate it

[2Pac:]
"...and I feel like if you walk by a street and you was walkin' on concrete and you saw a rose, growing outta concrete
Even if it had messed up petals and it was a little.. you know, to the side you would marvel at just seeing a rose grow through concrete.."

[Honey Cocaine:]
As a youngin' all I had was a dream
You was my brother, my hero, my team
I was down for you, all you did was sell
I was growin' up while you was in and out of jail
Waitin' at the court room, all of us silent
You was never home, you was always so violent
How you think I felt when I visited the prison
Of where my brother at while my partner gone missin'
I was gone dissin', but I was just hurt
From all those nights, those fights, those words
Shit, we used to argue all the time, I hated you
And witnessing your drug dealin' and I hated, too
It was my birthday and then some next shit
All them times, you just got your ass arrested
Family stressin', I'm surprised you ain't dead
From a life of a crime, and that war with the FEDS
Have you thought 'bout what you put me through? HUH?
And all the things I had to do for you
Like deal with the people who spoke your name
Like this bitch who disrespected you, I broke her frame
But it's okay, I'm your baby sis
And some day I just may be rich
And I got you, I ain't gotta say it
I just wanted you to tell me you appreciate it

[2Pac:]
"...and I feel like if you walk by a street and you was walkin' on concrete and you saw a rose, growing outta concrete
