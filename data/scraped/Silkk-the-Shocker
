For all you players, hustlers, ballers and even you smokers

[C-Murder]
Let me give a shoutout to the D Boys (drug dealers)
Neighborhood dope man, I mean real niggas
That'll make a dollar out of fifteen cents
Ain't got a dime, but'll ride to pay the rent
Professional crackslanger I serve fiends
I once went to jail for having rocks up in my jeans
But nowadays I be too smart for the task
C-Murder been known to keep the rocks up in a Skittles bag
Waitin on a kilo they eight I'm straight you dig
What you need ten, ain't no fuckin order too big
And makin crack like this is the song
You won't be getting yo money if yo shit ain't cooked wrong
Overcook yo' dope it might come out brown
Them fiends gonna run yo ass clean outta town
But fuck that I'm bout to put my soldiers in the game
And tell ya how to make crack from cocaine
One - look for the nigga wit the whitest snow
Two - no buying from no nigga that you don't know
Make yo way to the kitchen where the stove be
You gets the baking soda, I gots tha D
Get the triple beam and measure out yo dope
Mix one gram of soda for every seven grams of coke
And shake it up until it get harder
Then sit it on the stove in some ready made cold water
Twist the bitch like a knot while it's still hot
And watch that shit while it rock and rise to the fuckin top
Now ya cocaine powder is crack
Nigga I hopes you strapped cause you might get jacked

[Silkk the Shocker]
My phone rang I picked it up

What you need
(Silkk bout a coupla cakes)
I had it all in powder but it ain't no thang
Gimme a coupla hours I have it all in a caine
Trust nobody but my guns and god ask Mac and Kane and Abel
You probably catch me choppin "d" choppin ki's up on my mom's table
I got a big order for some coke
I called some hoes up
I want ya'll but naked while you cookin up my dope
I told ya'll we some Tru G's
See me and P and C
In Expeditions with uzi's
Breakin' down two ki's
Baby that's twenty-four oz's a piece
Cause see if it ain't about money
Then it ain't about me
Hella mail from sales
Hella ya-yo for scales
Come up short on my money I'm jumpin yo ass like bail
First of all you gotta have nuts
Don't give a fuck
Cause when I bust niggas duck
Cuz they know if I miss it ain't by much
Then pick up a Glock that hold bout seventeen
A coupla dope fiends
Some oz's
A triple beam
And then playa hit yo block
And tell the biggest nigga to raise up off the spot befo he get got
And I get rowdy That's why I acts like this
But I still rides rims and them gold D's (Ma Ma Make Crack like this)
Cause I sold crack like this

[Hook]

[Master P]
Nigga Nigga never let a nigga front you no dizos
Start from the ground, work yo way up to a kilo
Get some killers on yo team, keep one up in the chamber
For the jackas and the dope fiends
Fools comin up short, you better get rowdy
Kick down doors, show motherfuckers that ya bout it bout it
Break ki's down to oz's
Never buy any dope without weighin it on the triple beam
Fuck soda use B-12
Keep a stash for the droughts and take other niggas clientele
Check the mayonnaise jar for residue
Cause every fiend you miss want three or two
1. Never talk on the phone in ya house
2. Never slang dope out ya baby momma's house
3. Never fuck with snitches
Cause niggas that talk to the police is bitches
4. Keep a low key
And if you movin weight treat yo'self to an uzi
The first hit for free (damn)
But the next time you beep me
You betta have twenty G's
5. Never pay
Pimp hoes for the pussy
That's the 'Merican way
Clean up ya dirty money to good money
Cause legal money last longer than drug money

Keep my ice wrist, keep her tight bitch, between the trigger

I want ya'll to play this at funerals in the hood
Til all this black on black crime stop
Some say the blind lead the blind
But in the ghetto you never know
When it's gon be yo time

[Sons of Funk, Mo B. Dick, O'dell]
Sittin at the ghetto thinkin bout
All my homies passed away (uuunnnggghhh!)
Candy painted cadillacs and triple gold
That's how me and my boys rolled
How could it be?
Somebody took my boy from me
My best friend's gone
And I'm so all alone
I really miss my homies
Even though they gone away
I know you in a better place
And I hope to see ya soon someday

[Master P]
I used to hang with my boy even slang with my boy
Used to bang with my boy, goddam I miss my boy
We started out youngstas in the park throwin birds
In your hearse, damn it's sad to see my nigga in the dirt
The game got me workin, got me perkin, never jerkin
Still blowin dolja fo ya cause I know you up there workin
Ya little baby's cool and ya baby's mama straight
But today's a sad day to see the t-shirt with ya face
From the cradle to the grave, from the streets we used to fall
In the park you liked to ball, put yo name upon the wall
In the projects you's a legend on the street you was a star
But it's sad to see my homeboy ridin in that black car
A lotta soldiers done died, a lotta mothers done cried
You done took yo piece of the pie but you was too young to retire
Why soldiers ride for yo name leave it vain
Some Gs never change, damn they killed you for some change
Smile for my homie Kevin Miller my boy Randall
The ghetto persons that lost they loved ones to these ghetto scandals

Take a minute to smile for the dead (uuunnnggghhh!)
Smile for the dead (RIP 2Pac, Makaveli)
All my homies who done made it to the crossroads
(Biggie Smalls)

[Sons, Mo B. O'dell]
How could it be?
Somebody took my boy from me
(It's like I can't believe you gone)
My best friend's gone
(Sometimes I feel like I can't go on)
And I'm so all alone
(Everytime I see something you done left
I really miss my homies
(It just remind me, more and more of you, dawg)
Even though they gone away
(I just keep reminiscin)
I know you in a better place
(Cause I know you alright)
And I hope to see ya soon someday
(And I keep smilin, knowin I'm a see you in the crossroads]

[Pimp C]
We used to grip on the grain and flip them candy toys
But I'd give up all that bullshit if I could get back my boy
Off in the club smokin weed til 3, hollerin at the hoes
Spendin $4000 on me on gators and clothes
When I turned to rap, he had to chase the game
Nigga told me, "C, leave that dope, cause rappin is yo thang"
I ain't gone even lie, some nights I ride and cry
Wonderin why the real niggas always the ones to die
So I just smoke my weed and try to clear my mind
I wish that I had the power to turn back the hands of time
I wonder if there's a heaven up there for real Gs
For all the niggas in the game that be sellin keys
I keep my memories, try to keep my head strong
But baby it's hard to be strong, when yo main homie gone

[Sons, Mo B. O'dell]
Even though you gone away
(Even though you gone, you ain't never gon be forgotten)
I know you in a better place
(Cause as long as I'm here
You gon live through me and other TRU playas)
I really miss my homies
Even though they gone away
I know you in a better place
And I hope to see ya soon someday

[Silkk]
I'm just sittin here dazed thinkin bout all the times we had
Thinkin the past, some was good and some was bad
Remember Dante?
It was a group of us, just a group of five
Now three dead, one in jail, it seem right now I'm the only one alive
To all my soldiers before me, may ya'll rest in peace
When He took three, took my soul, just the bodies
He at the crossroads guide us out to the rest of me
Wishin I could rewind time like demos
Me and you gettin girls, writin down numbers like memos
Makin million dollar bets, makin all our money stretch like limos
Even though I smile, it's sad, but they say gangstas can't cry
But if I close my eyes and visualize me together
Then I suddenly wanna smile
To see you laid down when it's yo time, when your time was up
You never seen your child, but he's here to remind us
Even though you was wrong, I never could belive that that was true
You was with me forever, you could check my rest in peace tattoos
See me and C and P forever gon be ridin and thuggin
Rest in peace to all the ones that didn't make it
And rest in peace to my brother
We gon miss you

(I love these fools)
I know you in a better place
(Every time I get on my knees)
And I hope to see ya soon someday
(I pray for you, I'm glad you in a better place
I hope I see ya soon, ain't no more killin
Ain't no more fights, and ain't no more tears)[Mo B. Dick]
This is for the Burbans and the Cadillac's
With the tens and twelves bumpin in the back
This is for the players, hustlas, pimps and macks
With the Benz makin ends I mean them paper stacks
This is for the Burbans and the Cadillac's
With the tens and twelves bumpin in the back
This is for the players smokin doolamac
Slappin skins, makin dividends and riding strapped

[Master P]
(Uhhhhhh) wood grain with the leather seats
Windows so dark you need a flashlight to see me
Smokin on that doshia, four niggas in the back screaming No Limit soldiers!
True to the gizzame, stopped in the projects, sold a half an ounce of cocaine
Hit interstate ten, to Texas
Listening to DJ Screw just raced a Lexus
Called up Pimp C, did a song last week with my nigga Bun B
Twistin on some green spinach
And niggas still trippin, I ain't dead, I'm still in it

[Mo B. Dick]
This is for the Burbans and the Cadillac's

This is for the players, hustlas, pimps and macks
With the Benz makin ends and them paper stacks

[Silkk The Shocker]
See pockets full of dollars already stacked so I'm gangsta leaning sideways
Today ain't Friday, ten it is and today is my day
Take it from mister hundred spoke rider
Cadillac Suburban driver, pussy diver
Push the Glock inside when I'm riding
Flossing down the block, holla at my boys up in the third
Got the latest word, swerve to the side of the curb
A fiend that wanted me to serve him, I said bitch can't tell I'm off?
But I still gave him five dollars to wipe my white walls
And then I burst up out the block, dropped the top cause it was hot
Hit the spot with the most hoes at the sideshow, abouts to plot
Spin donuts, you know I'm acting, a straight up menace
Catch me spinnin, you can tell I was there cause there was a cloud of smoke when I was Finished
I seen five-O, and man he tried to sweat me
Thinkin he'd be nice and all cause I gotta 185 in the hood and you know they Can't catch me
And if you see me chilling you can stop me
But I keep that Glock, 40 up on the dashboard you never know who might try me
This is for the playas

[Mo B. Dick]
Playa, play on
I can't hate you homie
Playa, play on
I can't hate you homie

[Lil' Gotti Gambino]
Burbans and Lacs, mansions and bitches, money and weed
A made life is all I dream, paper chasing for that green
I'm thugging on the scene, nigga
Whatcha dont believe, well check the credentials, they'll tell ya
A niggas living presidential, I'm on the level that you bustas will never feel
My daughter thought I'd get caught up in the game and get killed
But reverse that shit and hit the studio and make a mill
For real, I'm slanging platinum shit until I'm old and ill
Lil' Gotti, I'm gonna make you feel what I say, I got time to parlay
Chill off in the bay, smoke some hay, I wouldn't have that shit no other way
The made life, the game tight, No Limit for life

Chorus: [Silkk, Mystikal]

We can't stop now bitch!!!
We can't stop
And you can't stop us
So bitch don't try
We TRU soldiers, we don't die
We don't die, we don't die. (2X)

1st Verse: [Mystikal]

I'm bout my paper, my paper
Important people on my pager
I might not drink Alize'
But I'll smoke you under the table
Don't make me peel your potato
Don't make the devil your neighbor
I MIGHT NOT BE NOTHING TO YOU
BUT I'm THE SHIT ON THIS LABEL!!!
Five hundred words a minute make it hard to digest what I say
But five hundred #1 hits on the billboard chart gon' keep it that way
Hold on as tight as you can
Whatever you do, don't loosen your grip
Not only are they anticipating your every move
They're waiting for you to slip!!!
But like I told you before
We not gonna fall for the banana in the tailpipe
I'm not bout livin' in no six by six
Wearing no motherfuckin jail stripes
Been Bout It from the start nigga, we raw nigga
You don't wanna, go to, war nigga
We superstar niggas
You know who we are niggas
From poverty in the projects
To livin' large niggas
It take one hell of a combination, to get what we got
We soldiers on a mission, and you can't stop us!!!

Chorus

2nd Verse: [Silkk The Shocker]

Nigga wanna START SHIT
That they know they can't finish
By far niggas wanna go to war
But they know when they ain't winning
Fixin' to keep this bitch jumpin, like a muthafuckin', second line
Been Bout It, and I'll be rowdy, and you gonna know it by my, second rhyme
No Limit chain around my neck, so check, and respect the sign
Y'all wanna play, but I guarantee that you won't play, a second time
Sometime I'm in camoflauge and sometime I'm in all black
Y'all wanna go to war with us, wit you knowin' we all strapped!!!
Fuck it, pop it, don't stop it, cuz I drop, by no means, look
Bitches dyin' like a dope fiend, while he have on a pair of old jeans
Nigga what? Pistols we all got, sometimes it's all Glocks
Keep one in the chamber for danger and make sure they all cocked
Went from a, small knot to a tall knot
Nigga please, I got all the G's for breakin' these keys down to all rocks
Blow up the spot till it's all hot, surround the world together cuz y'all not
Nigga we ain't gon stop jus cuz y'all stop then it's our props
If you wanna get it started, then let's started, but let's do it right
But if you wanna get started, get started, let's do it TONIGHT!!!
Likely to get your head busted, lined in some chalk

Chorus (2X)[Intro]
Check this out
You a playa if you got bitches and blunts in your house, right
(Right, right)
But you a motherfuckin' TRU G
If you get the muffins and she pay for the trees (what you tryna say)
Understand what I'm sayin', nigga you feel me
Y'all Captain Kirk ass niggas ain't gonna survive
In this 97 space age hustle
(So what you sayin')

[Hook x8]
Ya'll live for bitches and blunts
We live for weed and money

[Verse 1]
I stack green like cheese, smoke weed with g's
Sell cream to fiends and roll with beams
Playa haters can't take me, hungry bitches can't break me
God ya maybe, but ain't no man gone fade me
Got me deep in this game, some niggas don't change
Have mercy on P, just tryna have change
In my pockets I'm knockin', the feds can't stop me
Most hoes they jock me, I got knots in my pockets
Caviar and bitches, 6-4 and switches
Champagne and riches, but cookin' keys in kitchens
Mansions with marble floors, knockin' off chocolate hoes
Poots with initials, Ferraris and drop Rolls
I live with killers, dealers, and TRU niggas
No Limit guerrillas, mercenary killers
Beat's by the Pound, haters get clowned
Gone worldwide, but true to the underground

[Master P and Silkk]
Blow Cohiba blunts, keep e'm rollin' up
Got your bitch fiending bro, P meaning what

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I scream "the richest", tag teamin' with bitches
'96 we went gold, haters thought we was finished
'97 went platinum, now they screaming NO LIMIT
TRU niggas don't fall off this only the beginning

[Master P and Silkk]
Coming up for what, making hella bucks
Niggas getting bumped or what, counting cash up
Got this game sewed up, niggas straight up no cut
But y'all couldn't fuck with us, y'all couldn't fuck with us

[Master P]
Swingin' like Titanic, niggas see us and panic
After big bucks no wammies, on our way to the grammy
Ya'll couldn't fuck with killers, they call us dealers
Niggas livin' for scrilla, banking with peelas

[Master P and Silkk]
Army fatigues, niggas straight like g's
Livin' like soldiers with g's, soldiers at ease
Slangin' fuckin' tapes like keys, slang 'em just like keys
From Richmond to New Orleans, we be ballin'
Keep them bitches down on they knees, keep 'em on they knees
Got them smokin' on our weed, but not for free

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Silkk the Shocker]
Y'all live for bitches and blunts
I live for weed to make money
Man I want so much cash when I wake up in the mornin', I can't even much count it
Silkk the Shocker, or should I say the black Frank Nitti see
Oz's to make g's, the mayor gave me and P keys to the city
Livin' an American dream, 5 karats on my pinky ring
Ladies wanna make love to me, niggas wanna look at me all mean
But it's aaight cause you still wonder
I don't want your old lady
But she still flip me the number, I wish she'd flip me some money
See um, it's aight to have cash and thangs
Ghetto millionaires to live flashy man
600 we gonna be smashin' man
But since I can't spend no bitches
So I need some cash and thangs

The reason why, whodi I don't know; okay, yea

[Hook]

Game time hair done up, hang time

Young hero, dress and neck below zero
I'm the best that came in the game, ask Cleo
Holla back young'n (Ooh ooh!) pop ya colla
Call me Richie Rich, I got a dog named Dollar
Custom paint, 20's on my ride
But I keep it locked down cause I'm too young to drive
I got bank rolls or pesos
So my love dont cost a thing like J-Lo
I'm a baller ma I dont play wit play-doh
You seen Cribs - so that's how we roll

[Hook]

[Master P]
You got a mill'? Give it to the haters

[Hook]

[Lil' Romeo]

[Mia X]

Cuz I know you're type hot boys don't wanna do right
Screwing everything then have the nerve to wanna have a good wife
Nah bump that baby get ya sneakers and ya beeper

The table I'm financial stable and able
To let you know what I'm not gone tolerate
Pay for everything I got you can't throw shit
In my face wait a minute let me finish my name ain't Sparkle
No promises from ten years ??? only sees one kind of mista
On a mission paper chasing building things with a sister
I get caught up in my rapture ??? got you like a groupie
Gimp but you ain't getting inside ride with me
Oh no floss of my dough floss me on your arm
Boo I don't think so fantasize about the sex
Even lie on your I suck what rode who nah

And call you just another citizen living in it ya heard me?

Everything my homie said turned out to be tru
Either ya too easy or ya too greedy I can't figure it out
I'm like forget it who need it
If I wasn't Silkk the Shocker would like really try to sweat me
I always had girls but not like Halle and Vanessa
Calling me on three talking about how they gon' do me
Shit I love my fans but I ain't gone be messing with yall groupies
Or either you hoochies
Coming to my concert talking about
Silkk if you bout it you would and showing me they coochie
I'm like back up but see I might mess with em put my trust in em
I just trust em to be women ya heard me?
Now see my car and she was like I ain't got no plans
See my crib and stuff and she was like I ain't got no man
If I give her a gift she be like girl that fool is laying
If I give her a kiss she be like that's my man he love he just be playing
So I might give you a gift but don't think I'm a trick
I just like to treat real women like they my number one chick
But I know when a women ain't tru black
So when she mess up Ibe like I already knew that
You why cuz women do that ya heard me?

[Mia X]
Mama Mia KL on the cut and Mister Silkk the Shocker QB on the beat box-If we was owned by the white folks it will be all good
-But we independent, black owned and making scrilla
-We a threat to society
-They ban our movies our videos, but we still #1 in America
-You see a coward can talk shit behind a nigga back
-But only a man can tell you what's on his mind
When he look you in the eyes
-In other words, don't judge a book by its cover
-See we successful black businessmen
But we also mercenary soldiers

(Chorus)

Always look a man in the eyes before you kill him
Even if he's a coward or a motherfucking drug dealer
(My pops say)

Verse 1 (Master P)

I sell stones out, I'm breaking them got damn phones up
Niggas they popping them keys, Master P he fucking ??
Besides them g's, I'm ?? them keys but they didn't know
That I could go gold
Platinum and still slang keys out the record store
This caine got me sick
These niggas they talking that shit
Don't make me load this M16 and split your fucking shit
I caught the game from some old g's
Niggas they slanging they fucking keys
Got the game from New Orleans
Now the world know of me
I'm down south hustling from the west
To the east, in the midwest yeah ya'll niggas know of me
Trying to slang this ghetto dope to the world
Every woman, man and boy wrap these cd's up like furls
On the corner posted up with them ballers
Slanging that yella, niggas ya'll can't hold us
Gone for 15/5 when you see me its no drought
I'm the nigga on the corner with the fucking gold in my mouth
Got every fucking club bout it bout it
Got every nigga that you see rowdy rowdy
Cause I'm down here hustling putting the ghetto on the map
Independent, black owned and ain't scared to bust no caps

(Chorus x3)

Verse 2 (Mystikal)

Nigga tell me what you gone do
Its just me and you, you and I
Scrap and scuffle then grab them things mano a mano
If we did the mix
Flury gone smother it leave your ass studdering
Fludging
Tell your fucking boys don't move
Cause like a rug I got them covered
Niggas ain't like they used to be
Back in the days they were playing the dozens
These days niggas will kill ya
Talking shit, say it to the end of my muzzle
We don't want no trouble, black just as subtle
Tell you what you gone fuck around and find
If you disrespect my hustle
None of you niggas fuckers, young niggas fuckable
Some niggas ??, dumb niggas suffer
Before you can even think about making a move I'm already on it
I'll have to beat your ass to the punch cause the stong survive only
Hold on bitch this shit bout to hit the ceiling
The interference started from the ground up the building
Behind mine's I just don't give a fuck
Ain't no closing my eyes
I'm gone look in your face and tear your ass up

(Chorus x3)

Verse 3 (Silkk)

Aaahh its murder
Do or die, killed or be killed
Nigga who am I
Silkk the Shocker, do or die for a mil
Don't you see I be counting money like a machine
No how I'm saying I got to buy my green
For every fiend equals money like ching ching
My dream, know what I'm saying, got to get the cream or triple beam
By it for 15/5 and I sell it for 18
You know what I'm saying, you know what a nigga like known for
Nigga kill himself before he caught the bad one
You know what we known for
And its all good in the hood, but I still stay strapped
Keep my hands on my 45 cause these days niggas will try to straight jack
And you know how I'm saying, 4 g's and I run it
Never seen a nigga retire from the dope game, until I done it
And its cool I gotta reach eight digits
Any nigga in my way I gots to kill him
Got a look a man in the eye before you drill him

(Chorus)[Mo B. Dick]
This is for the Burbans and the Cadillac's
With the tens and twelves bumpin in the back
This is for the players, hustlas, pimps and macks
With the Benz makin ends I mean them paper stacks
This is for the Burbans and the Cadillac's
With the tens and twelves bumpin in the back
This is for the players smokin doolamac
Slappin skins, makin dividends and riding strapped

[Master P]
(Uhhhhhh) wood grain with the leather seats
Windows so dark you need a flashlight to see me
Smokin on that doshia, four niggas in the back screaming No Limit soldiers!
True to the gizzame, stopped in the projects, sold a half an ounce of cocaine
Hit interstate ten, to Texas
Listening to DJ Screw just raced a Lexus
Called up Pimp C, did a song last week with my nigga Bun B
Twistin on some green spinach
And niggas still trippin, I ain't dead, I'm still in it

[Mo B. Dick]
This is for the Burbans and the Cadillac's
With the tens and twelves bumpin in the back
This is for the players, hustlas, pimps and macks
With the Benz makin ends and them paper stacks

[Silkk The Shocker]
See pockets full of dollars already stacked so I'm gangsta leaning sideways
Today ain't Friday, ten it is and today is my day
Take it from mister hundred spoke rider
Cadillac Suburban driver, pussy diver
Push the Glock inside when I'm riding
Flossing down the block, holla at my boys up in the third
Got the latest word, swerve to the side of the curb
A fiend that wanted me to serve him, I said bitch can't tell I'm off?
But I still gave him five dollars to wipe my white walls
And then I burst up out the block, dropped the top cause it was hot
Hit the spot with the most hoes at the sideshow, abouts to plot
Spin donuts, you know I'm acting, a straight up menace
Catch me spinnin, you can tell I was there cause there was a cloud of smoke when I was Finished
I seen five-O, and man he tried to sweat me
Thinkin he'd be nice and all cause I gotta 185 in the hood and you know they Can't catch me
And if you see me chilling you can stop me
But I keep that Glock, 40 up on the dashboard you never know who might try me
This is for the playas

[Mo B. Dick]
Playa, play on
I can't hate you homie
Playa, play on
I can't hate you homie

[Lil' Gotti Gambino]
Burbans and Lacs, mansions and bitches, money and weed
A made life is all I dream, paper chasing for that green
I'm thugging on the scene, nigga
Whatcha dont believe, well check the credentials, they'll tell ya
A niggas living presidential, I'm on the level that you bustas will never feel
My daughter thought I'd get caught up in the game and get killed
But reverse that shit and hit the studio and make a mill
For real, I'm slanging platinum shit until I'm old and ill
Lil' Gotti, I'm gonna make you feel what I say, I got time to parlay
Chill off in the bay, smoke some hay, I wouldn't have that shit no other way
The made life, the game tight, No Limit for life

[Mo B. Dick]
This is for the Burbans and the Cadillac's
With the tens and twelves bumpin in the back
This is for the players smokin doolamac
With the Benz makin ends I mean them paper stacks
This is for the Burbans and the Cadillac's
With the tens and twelves bumpin in the back
This is for the players smokin doolamac
With the Benz makin ends I mean them paper stacks
Playa play on
I can't hate you homie
Rollin on them twenties[Silkk the Shocker]
Niggas hear this
I want niggas to mug niggas

Bounce wit me, bounce wit me.. c'mon bounce

[Chorus 2X: Master P]

Chorus

[Silkk the Shocker]
All they can say is, when they see us be like, that's them bastards!
Silkk and P equals dope, come on that's simple mathematics
Niggas wanna be more, famous then rich
Now I might hang wit a chick or just, hang in the bricks
Nuttin polite, opposite of nice, gangsta shit
You ain't never seen 2 or more niggas, gangsta then dis
See we right where da block at
Right where da spot at
Right where it's hot I mean

Ugggh, call me when you need
Plan B you ain't tripping
You heard me?

You Bonnie I'm Clyde
Let me rob a bank at night and go between them thighs
Holding like Sam
Cocked it like a tech 9 take it off safety and won't jam
Now I got you loving me
Your boyfriend's mugging me
But thugs ain't tripping keep on hugging me
And tell me how you want it (how you want it)
And we can have sex from 6:00 to 7 in the morning
Some say I'm a sucker for love

[Silkk The Shocker]
But the hardest niggas need us so blame I'm a thug
Now regardless
Pull out the red carpets when I come through
Never tripping making our ghetto wishes to come true
Don't blame it on the hangover
Blame it on the benzo and Lorenzo
And the way I spit game when it's going past ten
I got to be in it like a nympho
So here's the keys to my ride
And if you bout it my flight arrives at five

[Hook]
[Master P]
Plan B everybody needs one
Plan B call me when you need some (4X)
[Sons of Funk in background]
Can we lay all alone, doja burnin
I don't see nothing wrong
Is it cool to fuck?
Do you think you can love this thug
When you want to get closer
Fiending for this ghetto love
You can't get enough

[Kane & Abel]
Maybe it's the hennesey I want to give it to you
Have you screaming No Limit Soldier when I'm finished with you
Now turn the lights out ain't nobody here but us
Girl your s hitting you got me feeling some lust
So many playas in the ghetto you don't know who to trust
They tell you riding with this thug might be dangerous
Now sip the champagne hit the green let me play with your hair
Take you to Victoria's Secrets pick out something to wear

In the clouds of smoke making jokes we getting blunted
Getting hot cause you like the TVs in my 600
Keep it on the low don't tell your man we done it
Put my 9 on the dresser and let me undress you

[Hook] 4X

[Kane & Abel]
Kane & Abel, Silkk The Shocker, Master P, Sons of Funk

No Limit (uh-huh)
Ya heard me
Ghetto nigga
Watch how I spit this shit
I don't know what I'ma do next
Until then, watch me - watch me, watch me

[Silkk]
Executive thug look when I'm done
If last year I was on 20's
This year I'm on 21's
Niggas talk but huh we got plenty guns
Give niggas a choice now they can catch it from anyone
I ? I don't like niggas unless it's jail
I don't pass out nothin' look unless it's shells
Send niggas to the ? the rest to hell
And I don't box slim dog slim I'm less than frail
Everything we rock look is customized
And shorty gon' be sprung soon as I touch them thighs
You ask too many questions like dude like what's and why's
What the fuck we buy and what the fuck we drive
We just stay in the pits
Like stay in the mix
Stay into shit
Stay in a 6
Stay in the bricks
Just cause we got money dog
We still slick with it
Never say how it get done
We just get it did
They'll little deal or somethin' but that ain't nothin'
Spend a little change but look that ain't money
Niggas laugh but I'm like that ain't funny
What you call them lil' huh if that ain't dummies
I represent niggas in the hood that's boxed up
All my niggas doin' time
All of 'em locked up
The big ones are the ones that a lil' thin
The ones that's doin' reps of 10 jackin' off to Lil' Kim
No  Limit beef nigga
No Limit street
No Limit west nigga
No Limit east

[Slay Sean]
I spit fire
You know hot shit melt the wire
Off yo chain
Get it right it's not a game
I'm not the talkin' type
I throw slugs to the brain
Run up in spots
Make 'em point out the cain
Go outta town hustle
Switch up the slang
Down South with Silkk and Circuit just doin' it man
Puttin' in work
Come on son you bound to get hurt
I'm on some other shit
I roll around in a hurse
Run up on ya
Put a couple rounds in yo shirt
Undertaker leave you face down in the dirt
A frown and a smirk
Shit I'll put you down when it's worth
That goes for anybody walkin' on the face of this earth

[Short Circuit]
Think the audio tight wait till y'all see the video
Y'all gon' need a telescope to see us niggas with dough
I done copped dope with prison dough and locked the block
Till the cops came with Glocks and tried to rock my spot
Anything I see I want I cop don't talk to the cops
40 grand on a drop-top right off of the lot
Want what I got make a nigga ? blocks
On the block in the spot with razors cuttin' down blocks
They gon' catch me with a Glock somebody's socks get rocked
I ain't dealin' on the rock I'ma have to be shot
Shot and dropped any way my gun get to pop
I'ma be on night watch bangin' out with the cops

[Silkk]
I get paid look every time I cuss
Speak the truth every time I bust
Niggas still talkin'
I ain't got time to fuss
When I come through you ain't got time to duck
I'm a thug
Everything about me says that
Been real even way back
Only spit the truth dog
I only look to state facts
You still talkin' (bbrrddd)
Take that
I told you this time look I'ma lock the summer
I'ma roll through NY and rock the Tunnel
Look hop out the Benz
Hop into a Hummer
What the fuck I'm doin' it for look if not for money
Always been real
Never been fake
Always been a playa
Ain't never gon' hate
Concert ? tour like 70 a day
I was cool with 6
But now I'm more like 7 or 8[Mia X]

And the lady America was finally slaughtered
And divided into 3 quarters
Her children who was fit fell, peace
Battlin', golden', platinum
Friends of terror and endless bloodshed
Pity was not spared for no man, woman, child or rapper
And believe
For his rap was felt by everyone
And this time when trust had no meaning
Family and friends who survived destroyed one another
Decided to the world
Love, peace, and brotherhood
Soldiers, high ashes to survival
Master P
To open up a path to reality
For some, judgement

[Master P]

The devil took the straps off my nigga legs
The Virgin Mary came when my homie bleed
Too many fuckin' thieves and enemies
The vultures pecked the mouths for the green cheese
I watched his soul leave his clothes left him cold
On these streets, anything goes
He was on the road
It took 'em ten to do him in
The killas fled, damn, but they'll be back again
He was Polo'd down with the matchin' socks
I mean stuffed like a turkey with a half a key of cooked rocks
The reaper came and took him
I saw the tears from my baby mama's eyes over look him
As I walk through the shadow's of death
Where no rapper or no man can spare no breath
The kingdom of freedom is all they said
Why the shackle and chain?
My homie's life slain
From the cradle to the grave every soldier shall ride
Bite the apple of eternity (uggggHH)
Every mother will cry

[Chorus x2]

Keep your eyes on your enemies, and watch your friends
Put your life in your own hands, or your life will end

[Silkk]

Now who's to say if it's the beginning or ending
Start to finish
Losin' or winnin'
I'm trapped in a whole world of sin
Who's to say your life is worth more than mine
Should I give my heart to the President so he can live and I can die?
Now my whole life I was scared
The only judge is god
But why do I (we) live by these man made laws
Ten commandments they say do not steal or kill
But I lost to many niggas and some say they split my wig for meal
Heaven, leadin' up to the steps
Everything I do wrong in my days is leading to my death
And even though I never see
I believe there's a god
But I hate when your best friend turn to your enemy
When times is hard

[Chorus x2]

[Master P]

As the sand slowly poured
I see flashes of life
Time started ticking it's the end of my life
Blind fo' his eyes when he look at god
Behold no man or your life destroyed
He took many prophets and poured to the kingdom
Big ones and small ones
Good ones and mean ones
As the angel came the ghetto from hell
Some words of peace cuz they didn't know no better
So they sold to the pitch-forks of the fire
Do g's go to heaven or just young niggas retire
Crosses burned cuz they souls was scarred
Hoping for second chance but ain't none
Cuz it's yo' final call

[Chorus till fade][Master P]
It's crazy out here (uhhhhhhh)
Yo mama I'm tryin to keep my head strong (whats up Mystikal?)

Uhhhhhh! (uhhhhhh) I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it
Uhhhhhh! I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it

[Hook]
Uhhhhhh! This ghetto got me crazy
Mamma, won't you pray for your baby?
Uhhhhhh! I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it
Mamma, I'm just a ghetto child trying to make it

I feel like a bird nigga with no wings
I'm stuck in this ghetto trying to have a little change
My homies killing up each other cause we gotta eat
And I ain't tripping cause I'm running from the police
I done seen little kids in the projects starving
I done seen more hoes messing then Marvin
See in the ghetto the sun it barely shines
But so many niggas in jail and the welfare lines
And all my life I thought Bill Clinton ran the country
Until I found out Bill Gates had all the money
And the media starting east and west coast wars
I'm from the south, where they predijuce on us all
Come out of the powdered milk and eggs don't fill us up
But why the government sold us drugs and charges to clean us up
Gave us three halves and high interest student loans
Four dollar minimum wage and section eight, we call it home

Chorus x2

[Mystikal]
It's real when you can do whatever you want to do
When you want to do it
Ain't to many niggas out there living like that
That's why the rest of you niggas ain't never gone through it
How many niggas in the penn
How many niggas in the cemetary don't know why?
How many strikes y'all niggas need
How many innocent children in the ghetto got to lose thier lives?
WHY!!!! Why you gotta make your momma cry?
HUH!!!! She take you out of the street
Cause that's where you gonna die
But you won't listen cause your mind is one track
And your head is hard
And your getting flipped, and your talking back
Showing your ashy act, ass straight up off the wall
Lemme talk to y'all, don't think it's too hard to fall
But that's far and all
And sore and all, it's cool when it started off
Now niggas duckin bullets like dodgeballs
Niggas got me scared to plant my seeds, fear of high's gonna grow
Living in a messed up time, a messed up court
I'm telling ya, you can't do shit no more!
It's bigger than us, it's out of our hands
That's why I'm praying to God
Oh heavenly father, keep my head above the water
Cause it's your world, and we your children
Your sons and your daughters
We struggling, trying to get out of the ghetto
Trying to make it to mars!!!

Chorus x2

[Silkk The Shocker]
Dear mama pray for your son, hoping I can make it through this game
Wishing I can change, I've been through so much
Seen so many things, couldn't find the words to explain
The only way to avoid stress is to get high, by drinking hennessey but I
But I can't get too high, cause I gotta keep my eyes on my enemies
I've seen harder times, but there gonna be some harder days
Penetentary close, but you know what? Cemetaries ain't that far away
Before I die I'm trying to make the whole world feel
Like our people scared to stand there
The way we express ourself, they think that we all some killers
But look into the eyes of a ghetto child influenced by the street
Go to sleep to gunshots, wake up from the sirens of the police
See now my life ain't been the same nigga, life as a thug
If I had to draw a picture of my life
I have to paint my picture in blood
Closest homie died, before he die little cousin told me this
Get you something cause cemetaries
Packed full of niggas who had dreams to be rich
So keep your head up, to all my ghetto children it was hard
To tell my family one day I was gonna grow up to make millions
When I told them, they seemed to laugh at my so called dream
I like to scream when I came home from jail
When I was told best friend turned into a fiend
I ain't gonna lie, my conscience ain't clear, when I close my eyes
Of course you gotta realize, god forgive me, I'm just trying to survive
They cut welfare and health care, that shit gotta stop
I got a positive note, my auntie having a baby
Congratulations, she on rocks

Chorus 2X(*water bubbling*)
(*voice in background repeating "make crack like this"*)

[Master P]
Imagine substituting crack for music
I mean dope tapes, this is how we would make it
(There it is right there)
For all you players, hustlers, ballers and even you smokers

("Ma ma ma ma make crack like this")

[Master P]
Ghetto Dope, No Limit Records
("Ma ma ma make crack like this")
Part of the Tobacco, Firearms, and Freedom of Speech Committee
Thank you dope fiends for your support, ha ha

[C-Murder]
Let me give a shoutout to the D Boys (drug dealers)
Neighborhood dope man, I mean real niggas
That'll make a dollar out of fifteen cents
Ain't got a dime, but'll ride to pay the rent
Professional crackslanger I serve fiends
I once went to jail for having rocks up in my jeans
But nowadays I be too smart for the task
C-Murder been known to keep the rocks up in a Skittles bag
Waitin on a kilo they eight I'm straight you dig
What you need ten, ain't no fuckin order too big
And makin crack like this is the song
You won't be getting yo money if yo shit ain't cooked wrong
Overcook yo' dope it might come out brown
Them fiends gonna run yo ass clean outta town
But fuck that I'm bout to put my soldiers in the game
And tell ya how to make crack from cocaine
One - look for the nigga wit the whitest snow
Two - no buying from no nigga that you don't know
Make yo way to the kitchen where the stove be
You gets the baking soda, I gots tha D
Get the triple beam and measure out yo dope
Mix one gram of soda for every seven grams of coke
And shake it up until it get harder
Then sit it on the stove in some ready made cold water
Twist the bitch like a knot while it's still hot
And watch that shit while it rock and rise to the fuckin top
Now ya cocaine powder is crack
Nigga I hopes you strapped cause you might get jacked

[Hook: repeat all 4X]
Ghett Ghett Ghett Ghetto Dope
Ma Ma Ma Ma Make Crack like this Ghett Ghetto Dope

[Silkk the Shocker]
My phone rang I picked it up

(Silkk bout a coupla cakes)
I had it all in powder but it ain't no thang
Gimme a coupla hours I have it all in a caine
Trust nobody but my guns and god ask Mac and Kane and Abel
You probably catch me choppin "d" choppin ki's up on my mom's table
I got a big order for some coke
I called some hoes up
I want ya'll but naked while you cookin up my dope
I told ya'll we some Tru G's
See me and P and C
In Expeditions with uzi's
Breakin' down two ki's
Baby that's twenty-four oz's a piece
Cause see if it ain't about money
Then it ain't about me
Hella mail from sales
Hella ya-yo for scales
Come up short on my money I'm jumpin yo ass like bail
First of all you gotta have nuts
Don't give a fuck
Cause when I bust niggas duck
Cuz they know if I miss it ain't by much
Then pick up a Glock that hold bout seventeen
A coupla dope fiends
Some oz's
A triple beam
And then playa hit yo block
And tell the biggest nigga to raise up off the spot befo he get got
And I get rowdy That's why I acts like this
But I still rides rims and them gold D's (Ma Ma Make Crack like this)
Cause I sold crack like this

[Hook]

[Master P]
Nigga Nigga never let a nigga front you no dizos
Start from the ground, work yo way up to a kilo
Get some killers on yo team, keep one up in the chamber
For the jackas and the dope fiends
Fools comin up short, you better get rowdy
Kick down doors, show motherfuckers that ya bout it bout it
Break ki's down to oz's
Never buy any dope without weighin it on the triple beam
Fuck soda use B-12
Keep a stash for the droughts and take other niggas clientele
Check the mayonnaise jar for residue
Cause every fiend you miss want three or two
1. Never talk on the phone in ya house
2. Never slang dope out ya baby momma's house
3. Never fuck with snitches
Cause niggas that talk to the police is bitches
4. Keep a low key
And if you movin weight treat yo'self to an uzi
The first hit for free (damn)
But the next time you beep me
You betta have twenty G's
5. Never pay
Pimp hoes for the pussy
That's the 'Merican way
Clean up ya dirty money to good money
Cause legal money last longer than drug money

Slide once too and stomp your feet on the floor

[Hook x2]

Touch your head, your shoulders, your knees your toes

Nigga I step through the door
Clear my throat like DJ Kool (cough cough)
Cause I lay back motherfucking fool, down more hoes then pool
You know like me comin through this bitch sick or
Watchin em with my dick hard
Put my dime to the side as I slide my way to the bar
Dig this ho named Michelle
Or it could have been Danielle, Tanielle
Kiss and tell I won't

I'm smooth like that, I'm cool like that
And a wreck like effect, jack a fool like that
See, I see some ho from the rear come over here
Whisper in here ear make myself clear
Fortune let's break up out of here
See boy watch how I bust when I run through it
The game I spit get my hoes, fuck it alcohol and slow music
You know how I do it run the game on em

Huh, nothin wrong with making you bumpin and grind nigga

[Hook x2]

[Mr. Serv-On]

Hit the bar I'm your star Mr. serve alazay
With the chrome keg, so how you play
Six hundred on them things in the parking lot
I like to bang alot, my babies momma never called alot
So ain't no stop when I drop a flick for the chicken
Licking on your breast
And your necks in the club step
So what's next, I'm bout a drink or two
One for me, three for you
I gotta woman you can be my boo
You say your name is Tiki so how you wanna see me
Twenty five for guest
On my rolex ticks on the wrist
I know you with this
Drop the number on the under you can be my hit
For the same no wonder you keep coming around
My homie young Silkk put me down with the game and the flow
If I teach you how to touch your head
Your shoulders, your knees and your toes
I can flip that ass till the morning light it's my life

[Hook]

[Mia X]

Might wanna shuffle all the way to the dance floor
Get your hands up, tell the DJ to turn it up
A bottle or more, with a straw in my right hand
I know I'm feeling good cause very seldom do I dance
I usually play it cool moving side to side
Be too clean to sweat, but tonight it's all right
Got my ice on shine like melt the club
And I ain't trying to go home until the sun comes up
Nigga what
Ain't no leaving with you
I ain't no one night rome (who you think I am)
You'll be hustlin all your life
So you can afford these droors
Your pimping gotta be large, converse to the point
Then in a month maybe we can blow this joint
And you can meet my up and down southern rodeo
For sho', chewbaccas leaving niggas on my toes
Oh, the biggest mammas hard, laying non stop
Hold up, I think I see some playas kickin off the bus stop
And twirkers pop while them niggas watch em get hot
You all know this shit don't stop so let the chorus drop

[Hook x4]Intro: Silkk (Cam'Ron)

Remix
(That's right) Silkk the Shocker
Uh, Cam'Ron (You ain't know) No Limit
(That's right) Untertainment
(I'm here and there) mo' money
(I'm here and there)
Ya don't know?

[Verse One: Cam'Ron]
Aye yo I just walk wit' ya'll, I don't wanna rhyme
I just need talk wit' ya'll
Mamacita, senortia
I'm lookin' for my wifey
Cats always love me, till they girls start to like me
They don't know I'm sheisty, and all my jewels Icey
Tryin' to settle down Ma, stop actin' all fiesty
Cause 'I don't wanna be a playa no more'
Know it's soft, but I cam with a 'core
For the love of Money, Charli, whoa It Ain't My Fault
Like Silkk, it's so timid, my trunk, it go wit' it
The whole Squad is Terrorin', cats is No Limit
And I'm a diplomat, I'm a diplomat
Where my honies at?, where my money at?
That's why we act like that
Clak clak clak!, pat pat pat!
So all you girls bring your thongs and shit
Don't front, cause you know what song this is
Ju don't know

[Hook: Wyclef]
Ya don't know what we're going through
Ya don't know the things that Cam is showing you
What we're about to do
You don't know
Ya don't know what we're going through
Ya don't know the things these thugs will do to you
You and your family through
Ya don't know

[Verse Two: Big Punisher]
Yo, yo
All the mami's know me, the Spanish kid wit' the goatee
If this was L.A., I'd be a motherfuckin O.G
Ya my taste, thick in the waist, pretty in the face
Dominican race, like my twin Triple Seis
Hot as hell, I'm trickin' in
Shorties sharp as nails, the official chick
Reppin Uptown to Harlem World, where we at
I'm up coughin in the ambulance
From way downtown, they got the Horses and the Carriages
For 40 bucks, you can ride and get ya hug on
Another 20, puff lye and get ya crush on
It's all love, just like the Bud' when ya hit it
Cause way downtown, you know the fuzz is tryin' to hear it
So when ya spark, ya make sure it's in the dark
And most importantly, stay away from Central Park
Cause cops live, just to put away a thug
But not today, cause me and my baby in the Cabaret of Love

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Charli Baltimore]
Yo yo yo yo yo yo yo, uhh
I thought I already barked on cats about Westhaven
It ain't work, gotta Scream on cats like Wes Craven
Owwwww!, they ain't know I hadn't in me
Like lil' dicks, didn't know they had it in me
Don't you know don't you know, we pull up from a show
Cam and chrome bag the hoes, I Prada bags all the dough
And caked out, break out, uh
Horse & Carriage, forced to marriage, been had too many carats
And they ain't know, passin' that down
Where I come from
Ask Jane, that's my dun-dun
How we handle them dumb dumb's
And we like, Siskel and Elbert
We review cats, thumbs up if they they shit's right
And down if they new jack's
You might see Charli, in a Benz or Ferrari
Hennesey or Pacardi, gettin' bent at a party
But I flip, be the new face, cover of Trace
This the motherfuckin remix, we ain't need no {Mase}

Uh huh uh huh
We like it (Slikk the Shocker)
Uh huh uh huh (Cam'Ron, No Limit)
(Untertainment)
(Mo' money, ya heard me)

[Verse Four: Silkk the Shocker]
I live life like a thug, cause time's is rough
Convicted felon; now I like, rhyme for bucks
Ball till I fall, should I say, my time is up
And I cop you diamonds, never diamond cut
Forget the money, cause I could ball with or without the shipment
And I'm down girl, but I could ball with or without the chick
Sillk the Shocker, Cam'Ron, now how you gonna doubt us a hit
(Must be a car), Miss I could pull you, with or without the six
Now I ain't the C-E-O, but I ain't far from it
So if I ain't far from C-E-O
That mean I ain't far from havin' C-E-O money
Can't discuss what I'm worth, but I'm worth this much
Like Mantigo, fall back like snatchin' purses for bust
So many styles - drop a beat, I'mma drop a hit
Rap game stop for the dope game - and cop a brick
No Limit Soldier baby, so watch the talk
Get lost like ohhhhhhh, "It Ain't My Fault!"
I'm from the N-O, L-I, M-I to the T
Tru my click, Silkk, the Shocker, yeah that's me
Now look, money I'm tryin' to make it
Bustas I'm tryin' to break, girls is like
Ooh I love Silkk, and then, ooh I hate him!
Cause they can't have me, but I don't look
I can't afford to live average
So senorita, let me walk you to my carriage
Now I don't wanna settle down, but we can do it like we married
Cheese!

I be the reason why they buried ya, and carried ya
I be the nigga that put the wood in your fiance
The reason why she didn't marry ya
I be the nigga they try to keep from around, hanging around your sister
I be the nigga they call Silkk The Shocker, you might call me MISTER!
Now I got a mob ties, I'm a ghetto wise guy
Military minding, on the front lines, always pull off the drive bys
Case over like the last song, like all the cash gone
Heir to the throne, cause I'm the little brother of the last don
Little bitch can't mix, flip shit, loose lips sink ships
Plus I gotta pair of cement shoes, I can make fit, your a fake bitch
Keep my ice wrist, keep her tight bitch, between the trigger
Keep a tight grip, infrared on my shit so I don't miss
Now I'm that razor that cuts the dope, it ain't nothin but a 504
Member the one they call Vito, yeah that's me (you know)

When you run, I'm the danger, I'm the smack and the pimp slap
I'm the shit that bubble up when you cook that crack
The nigga that fucked up the party when I pull my strap
The nigga that fucked all the hoes I'll be trying to mack

No Limit mercenary killas, nigga wit army fatigues

[Fiend]
All my rivals remember me, Fiend

Gettin' slugs at your own body
For my piece, or Sugar Hill, I'm New Orleans like Lolli
I'm fearin' no man, as long as I'm stompin' in these Broganes
There's no playin', soon as this army stop, ya' got no hands
Damn!!! Ready for war, and keep the weed lighted
If they ain't indicted still, blast it, Fiend the insighted prophet

[C-Murder]
I'm a No Limit soldier, nigga, it's in my blood
I started rappin', so I wouldn't have to sell drugs
We Bout It!!! Muthafuckas representin' them killas
TRU tatted on my back cuz I make moves wit thug niggas
You don't wanna go to war, cuz I'ma bring the brigade
Ask the colonel, we rowdy nigga tryin' to get paid
Affiliated with game, totin' thangs that pain
On the corners we hang, and we slangin' the pain!!

Chorus

3rd Verse: [Mystikal, Mac]

[Mystikal]
A helluva, helluva nigga right chea

And a highly decorated lieutenant
I'm up on the front line, you all the way to the rear
But ya still gettin' injured
NIGGA DON'T YOU KNOW BY NOW THE TANK CAN'T BE DENTED?!!
And when we reach a hundred million cartridges

If I told ya', I showed ya'!!
I'll break y'all, outrank y'all, I'LL MAKE YA' BORN TO BE A SOLDIER!!

[Mac]
Whoa, murder, murder, kill, kill it's real
Shell-Shock turn your neighborhood block into the battle field
Nigga, soldier rag still on my eye, no lie

We tattooed, I done gone cashews, ain't no turnin' back

And it get trifer, but I'm a lifer
A camoflauge sniper, from the rooftop I might ignite ya

Chorus

4th Verse: [Lil' Gotti Gambino, Skull Dugrey]

[Lil' Gotti Gambino]
Gotti I told ya', I'm a muthafuckin' soldier
Forty calibers and doja, what keep makin holes
Nationwide exposure, for me and my brethren
For Fiend to bust'em, leavin' my enemies bleedin'
Being a soldier many fourteens, I be needin'
A No Limit soldier, till the day of my leave

[Skull Dugrey]
I been a No Limit soldier since 1994
Them niggas know one thing, that Skull broked in the door
They watched me in Waco, as I bring the flow
What you sayin', hanh you nigga? You bitch? Yeah, you ho!!!
You know one thing you can't be fuckin' round wit these niggas
Niggas out the tank, straight spittin' on you niggas

Slammin' jive bitches like you, dead in the pavement!!!

Chorus

5th Verse: [Big Ed, Mia X]

[Big Ed]
Nigga make some room!!! Nigga, Back up, back up
Forget that thing out the trunk, and act up, act up
Got my tank dogs steppin' camoflauge fatigues
I represent like a loaded weapon, paper bought wit P
When I get that thing, everybody look down and round and round
Got the M-1 spittin' fire, bring yo' set to the ground
Got the C-4 explosives in the black backpack
Big Ed be puttin' down like that!!!!!

[Mia X]
We come strapped in we roll thick
We represent that TRU click
Playa Haters, yeah we know who you are
Make infrared shine on your head like the North Star
Bomb shit, boss bitch, mama set it off
Let it be known cowards you don't wanna go to war
The hard hitta still be the biggest mama nigga
Swallow yo' shit like a fuckin' Anaconda nigga
So, bring it, bring it on, how you wanna do it, what?
Cuz next to other's knees, I cover fuckin' dust
Anten-Hut nah, take it to the battle field
Shoppers gon run, while we kick our enemies doors
I ask the lord, they don't want no more?
Mama, drama, told ya' No Limit done took over

Chorus

[Silkk]
I thought I told ya
Pass the doja
GAME OVER!!!!!1,2, You hear the clock tickin'?
Tick-tock, You about to stop livin'
Tick-tock, I want you to remember me
Tick-tock, but the day don't have no memory

[Hook]
I'm comin'!
Nobody could stop me, nobody could hold me
Nobody control me

I'm here to do my thing, I'm here to bring the pain
I'm never ever gon' change!
I'm comin'!
Nobody could stop, nobody could hold me
Nobody control me
I'm comin'!
I'm here to do my thang, I'm here to bring the pain
I'm never ever gon' change!

[Verse 1]
Like Tropicana, I got the juice
Offer the leash to let the dog loose
Don't make me call up the crew
Now they gettin' scared when I call up my troops
I'm the One like Neo, cocky like T.O
Nobody could guard me like I'm shootin' a free throw
This is illegal, my flow is legal
And its me, there will never be a sequel
See, I'm fly like a pelican
And while I'm here, yeah, I'm gon' represent
If your sick, then I'll be your medicine
And you already know who I'm better than
No doubt, yeah, I'm a veteran
And when done you gon' think you got ran over by elephants
Since I came ain't been the same like ever since
And that talking, yeah, it better end

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
This is: My world, my way, my life
And if I gotta do it I gotta do it right
So everything I want, go ahead and gimme that
If ya girl with me just know that you ain't gettin' her back
Yeah, she want a bad boy
And I'm all about my cash boy
You see me all up in the Jag boy
I know that make you mad boy
But don't make me beat ya ass boy
So don't go there
Ya career's like a treadmill: you runnin' but you ain't goin' nowhere
Me, on the other hand
I can blow 100 stacks and bounce back rubberband
30 karats here, 100 on the other hand
I do me, I don't worry 'bout another man
I'm way past'em, got'em playin' catch up
I'll be right there if you ever mess up

[Hook]

Tick-tock[Intro]
I want ya'll to play this at funerals in the hood
Til all this black on black crime stop
Some say the blind lead the blind
But in the ghetto you never know
When it's gon be yo time

[Sons of Funk, Mo B. Dick, O'dell]
Sittin at the ghetto thinkin bout
All my homies passed away (uuunnnggghhh!)
Candy painted cadillacs and triple gold
That's how me and my boys rolled
How could it be?
Somebody took my boy from me
My best friend's gone
And I'm so all alone
I really miss my homies
Even though they gone away
I know you in a better place
And I hope to see ya soon someday

[Master P]
I used to hang with my boy even slang with my boy
Used to bang with my boy, goddam I miss my boy
We started out youngstas in the park throwin birds
In your hearse, damn it's sad to see my nigga in the dirt
The game got me workin, got me perkin, never jerkin
Still blowin dolja fo ya cause I know you up there workin
Ya little baby's cool and ya baby's mama straight
But today's a sad day to see the t-shirt with ya face
From the cradle to the grave, from the streets we used to fall
In the park you liked to ball, put yo name upon the wall
In the projects you's a legend on the street you was a star
But it's sad to see my homeboy ridin in that black car
A lotta soldiers done died, a lotta mothers done cried
You done took yo piece of the pie but you was too young to retire
Why soldiers ride for yo name leave it vain
Some Gs never change, damn they killed you for some change
Smile for my homie Kevin Miller my boy Randall
The ghetto persons that lost they loved ones to these ghetto scandals

Take a minute to smile for the dead (uuunnnggghhh!)
Smile for the dead (RIP 2Pac, Makaveli)
All my homies who done made it to the crossroads
(Biggie Smalls)

[Sons, Mo B. O'dell]
How could it be?
Somebody took my boy from me
(It's like I can't believe you gone)
My best friend's gone
(Sometimes I feel like I can't go on)
And I'm so all alone
(Everytime I see something you done left
I really miss my homies
(It just remind me, more and more of you, dawg)
Even though they gone away
(I just keep reminiscin)
I know you in a better place
(Cause I know you alright)
And I hope to see ya soon someday
(And I keep smilin, knowin I'm a see you in the crossroads]

[Pimp C]
We used to grip on the grain and flip them candy toys
But I'd give up all that bullshit if I could get back my boy
Off in the club smokin weed til 3, hollerin at the hoes
Spendin $4000 on me on gators and clothes
When I turned to rap, he had to chase the game
Nigga told me, "C, leave that dope, cause rappin is yo thang"
I ain't gone even lie, some nights I ride and cry
Wonderin why the real niggas always the ones to die
So I just smoke my weed and try to clear my mind
I wish that I had the power to turn back the hands of time
I wonder if there's a heaven up there for real Gs
For all the niggas in the game that be sellin keys
I keep my memories, try to keep my head strong
But baby it's hard to be strong, when yo main homie gone

[Sons, Mo B. O'dell]
Even though you gone away
(Even though you gone, you ain't never gon be forgotten)
I know you in a better place
(Cause as long as I'm here
You gon live through me and other TRU playas)
I really miss my homies
Even though they gone away
I know you in a better place
And I hope to see ya soon someday

[Silkk]
I'm just sittin here dazed thinkin bout all the times we had
Thinkin the past, some was good and some was bad
Remember Dante?
It was a group of us, just a group of five
Now three dead, one in jail, it seem right now I'm the only one alive
To all my soldiers before me, may ya'll rest in peace
When He took three, took my soul, just the bodies
He at the crossroads guide us out to the rest of me
Wishin I could rewind time like demos
Me and you gettin girls, writin down numbers like memos
Makin million dollar bets, makin all our money stretch like limos
Even though I smile, it's sad, but they say gangstas can't cry
But if I close my eyes and visualize me together
Then I suddenly wanna smile
To see you laid down when it's yo time, when your time was up
You never seen your child, but he's here to remind us
Even though you was wrong, I never could belive that that was true
You was with me forever, you could check my rest in peace tattoos
See me and C and P forever gon be ridin and thuggin
Rest in peace to all the ones that didn't make it
And rest in peace to my brother
We gon miss you

(I love these fools)
I know you in a better place
(Every time I get on my knees)
And I hope to see ya soon someday
(I pray for you, I'm glad you in a better place
I hope I see ya soon, ain't no more killin
Ain't no more fights, and ain't no more tears)Intro: [Silkk, Mystikal]

Chorus: [Silkk, Mystikal]

We can't stop now bitch!!!
We can't stop
And you can't stop us
So bitch don't try
We TRU soldiers, we don't die
We don't die, we don't die. (2X)

1st Verse: [Mystikal]

I'm bout my paper, my paper
Important people on my pager
I might not drink Alize'
But I'll smoke you under the table
Don't make me peel your potato
Don't make the devil your neighbor
I MIGHT NOT BE NOTHING TO YOU
BUT I'm THE SHIT ON THIS LABEL!!!
Five hundred words a minute make it hard to digest what I say
But five hundred #1 hits on the billboard chart gon' keep it that way
Hold on as tight as you can
Whatever you do, don't loosen your grip
Not only are they anticipating your every move
They're waiting for you to slip!!!
But like I told you before
We not gonna fall for the banana in the tailpipe
I'm not bout livin' in no six by six
Wearing no motherfuckin jail stripes
Been Bout It from the start nigga, we raw nigga
You don't wanna, go to, war nigga
We superstar niggas
You know who we are niggas
From poverty in the projects
To livin' large niggas
It take one hell of a combination, to get what we got
We soldiers on a mission, and you can't stop us!!!

Chorus

2nd Verse: [Silkk The Shocker]

Nigga wanna START SHIT
That they know they can't finish
By far niggas wanna go to war
But they know when they ain't winning
Fixin' to keep this bitch jumpin, like a muthafuckin', second line
Been Bout It, and I'll be rowdy, and you gonna know it by my, second rhyme
No Limit chain around my neck, so check, and respect the sign
Y'all wanna play, but I guarantee that you won't play, a second time
Sometime I'm in camoflauge and sometime I'm in all black
Y'all wanna go to war with us, wit you knowin' we all strapped!!!
Fuck it, pop it, don't stop it, cuz I drop, by no means, look
Bitches dyin' like a dope fiend, while he have on a pair of old jeans
Nigga what? Pistols we all got, sometimes it's all Glocks
Keep one in the chamber for danger and make sure they all cocked
Went from a, small knot to a tall knot
Nigga please, I got all the G's for breakin' these keys down to all rocks
Blow up the spot till it's all hot, surround the world together cuz y'all not
Nigga we ain't gon stop jus cuz y'all stop then it's our props
If you wanna get it started, then let's started, but let's do it right
But if you wanna get started, get started, let's do it TONIGHT!!!
Likely to get your head busted, lined in some chalk

Chorus (2X)[Craig B]
What's really happenin?
This shit again for the 99
Silkk The Shocker, Mystikal, and Craig B
It still ain't my fuckin fault
Ya heard me?

Chorus
[Silkk The Shocker/(Mystikal)]
(Uh ohhhhhh!)
Ohhhhhhhhhhhh
It ain't my fault
(Did I do that)
It ain't my fault
(Did I do that)
It ain't my fault
(Did I do that) x2

[Mystikal]
That's right my meat and potatoes come from my lyrical label
I throw my rhymes for No Limit like Jeff George throw for the Raiders
Don't cut the head off a hater, don't cash the check that they paid ya
Jump in a Deville or Mercedes, Lexus or Navigator
Five hundred niggas talkin bout what they goin do, how they goin ruin my day
Not none of them niggas be talkin like that when they come round my way
Hold your mouth as tight as you can, whatever you don't loosen your lip
I make your tightest hardest rapper brush his teeth with my dick
I'm strict, I'm rich, I'm young, I'm black, I'm set
I got it, I hold it, I run it, I do it to death
I'm hot, I'm dirty, I'm oiled, I'm strapped, I'm done
Don't blame it on me if the police find a pistol and blunt

Chorus x2

[Silkk The Shocker]
Ahhhhh, lemme get it started, respect that I can finish
You talk about goin to war, if you knowin you can't win
We'll make our money make cash, with no gimmicks
I ride the tank and my back reads No Limit
Mistah rowdy rowdy, write a book about it
Every rhyme, all the time you make a hook about it
Money I count it, but it ain't enough
Heard I had chicks around me, chicks I can't touch
Since I have niggas around me that ain't goin bust
If you ever see like that you know them niggas ain't with us
It ain't my fault if my name spell cash
It ain't my fault if your girl got my name tatooed on her ass
It ain't my fault if your concert can't sell out half the show
It ain't my fault if you do twice as much as me and I get half the dough
Yall saw me style, change my flow
Bad money, good money, change my dough
I can't be bought, can't be bought, I didn't do it ain't my fault
Now what

Chorus x2

[Silkk The Shocker/(Mystikal)]
Made man (that's that rapper)
Mistah! (ghetto fabulous)
(Hangin out the door boy) 504 boy
(I bet I got cash) you got to get more boy
(Hit em up, hit the floor boy) Gotta go boy
(I don't die no ho boy)
That's Nino Brown (G Money) and I'm Vito...boy

Chorus x4

[Silkk The Shocker]
Yeah
From the east coast
To the west coast
North, midwest, southside
All my dawgs
It ain't chall fault, It ain't my fault
Don't be mad at me
I'm makin it happen ya heard me?
