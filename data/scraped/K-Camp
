[Verse 1]
4 bad bitches, man the pleasure all mine
We ain't doin' nothing, tryin' to have a good time
Roll around the city, Porsche seats on recline
4 bad bitches fuckin' at the same time
Bitch named Keisha got an ass like a bubble
Feed her M&M's, watch it turn to some trouble
Two hands on the ball, shorty just doubled
Once I get mine I ain't trying to cuddle
All in the party hippy trippy off the henny
Jar full of weed, baby girl I got plenty
Break fast for the chick like I work at Denny's
Shawty where the shots I need many, many, many
Molly in the system, drinkin' out the bottle
Shorty goin' in, going hard full throttle
Instagram likes got her feeling like a model
If you looking' for the drugs, don't worry I got em

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Shot number 4 got her still talking sober
Molly got her ass wide awake no Folgers
Aye what it is Diego bring the Doja
One more shot, I'm in that hole like a gofer
Smoke, smoke, smoke
Drink, drink, drink
Bitch I'm Getting money give a damn what you think
One more shot, hella bent, might faint
Super lit hit it ho
Going hard in the paint

[Verse 2]
Fruit rolling up he ain't ran out of yet
Boutta take off, my migos offset
Rolled up the blunt, got a dutch full of Shrek
Said that she want more, guess she ain't done yet
Green Green Green
Mean Mean Mean
Bad bitch kissin'

If you gone do it baby do it for the team
And it's on blowing strong
Money long, Limousine

[Hook][Intro: Juicy J]

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
All I need is one more skank, dirty pussy, suck my dick

And she say she a virgin, bitch, shut the fuck uuupp!
I'm 'bout my bread, gettin' throwed, gettin' blowed
Gettin' trippy, gettin' lit on these hoes
Fuck 'em slow, in my cup, colt 45, high as fuck
Twenty dab, hundred for the thousand dollar tab
Conjure my cab

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
You ain't wavy, there's no beach around, please, sit down
Stretch Armstrong ass rappers out here reaching now
Pay attention, listen up, I'm teachin' now
Hit your brakes, you're screeching now
Pulled two bitches for the threesome, each are down
Have no mercy on a person with a bitch who's thirsty
Because firstly, you will lose if it's you verse me
Hop on Google, you can search me
Been this person since the nursery
Bow down, you're not worthy
Damn, her ass is fat and boobs are perky
Should I hit that? I may or may not, still on the fence
Snatch if I want her, I'm willing to bet
Bet the house, if I ain't stealing her yet
By the time she meet me, you don't feel I'm a threat?
You'll feel the regret
Bitch, I'm a thief, don't you see these gold teeth?
I'm as evil and cold as a villain could get

[Hook]

[Verse 2: K Camp]
Look, dog, dog out, ain't nothing changed
New city, plus new hoes, equals, new pussy, just to entertain
Capping out, I want the whole thing
Let her swallow the whole thing, freaky hoes got no shame
If you throw that back bitch, I won't complain
All in the club, go commando
She a trap girl, met her ass at the bando
Pouring up more than she can handle
Ones on the booty, man, R.I.P Nando, damn
Let the lil bitch take that like Diddy
You know what it is, everytime I'm in the city
Slums in this bitch, let the shit get gritty
Whole lotta ass, plus the face real pretty
Okay, but look at the shit that I'm on
Bought a new whip, bought a new home
Bought her new lips, that for the dome
Bought a new bitch, I can't go wrong
Ho at the six, leave me alone
G it's too easy, I'm growing like phones
She gave me the pussy, boy, off of this song

[Hook]

[Verse 3: P-Lo]
Damn, I done took your beezy
Everytime I'm gone, she say that she need me
She ain't get no call, she know I got reasons
They ain't really balling, you know that they reaching
I'm thuggin' with my bros, I bet she make it grow
Don't got love for these hoes, lil stunner
She want it in her, raw, you know Imma tell her naw
I put it in her jaw, lil stunner
Took your bitch after the club, she wanna fuck, aye, aye, aye
She in a rush, maybe she think she in love, aye, aye, aye

So tell me why we waitin'

[Hook]

Wanna go to war like spartans
Hit 'em with the carbine
And I keep the strap, like Marvin the Martian
Gas and the Glock in the glove compartment
Free Westside, tell them fuck (?)

[Verse 22: Tabius Tate]
Okay I'm 300

[Verse 23: Zeus]

[Verse 25: Nyemiah]
I don't fall in line, I lead it
Heads up, I'm so conceited
I ain't never seen a dude that I needed
Say shit once, and I don't repeat it
Sweden in that B.M

But it ain't no creepin', don't be sleepin'
Supremacy 300, knee deep in

Young Eastside nigga Jacquees(Jacquees)

[Verse 27: Retro Jace(Two9)
Drop 'em aside like Compton
Potato on the tip like condoms
Calculator clip, they don't want no problem
4-5 Just like a pill, might pop 'em
Uh, Goon's that'll shoot you for a hoodie
Copped a camera man, just to get the footage
Whole crew gon' mob, and I don't mean Goodie
Hit him in the head, and he gon' need goodies

[Outro: Flex Knox]

Wrath of the Titans
Monsters unite

Kissing on your neck then I'm coming for the shirt
Don't try to act now you on my turf
Got her so wet that a nigga might surf (Woo!)
Got her so wet that a nigga might surf
Don't play around with it cause I know what it's worth
This ain't nothing new girl I know what you like
Wanna play, wanna fuss, wanna nag, wanna fight
Every time you say that I'm wrong but I know that I'm right
You just want to get it in, you just want me to bite
All on yo neck, passionate sex

All the attitude you can keep that there
Deepstroke from the back while I'm pulling on yo hair

[Hook]

[Hook x2: K. Camp]

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Damn I miss the '90s, yeah shit was wild
We was livin' like rock stars, droppin' Mystic Styles
Ain't nobody else believe in what we was puttin' down
Nigga almost homeless trying to get it off the ground
No support everybody thought we never be shit
Tryna start our own label on some Master P shit
Tryna get some distribution majors labels ain't feelin' us
Doors slammed in our face, still ain't givin' up
Still on the grind, still on the rise
Even had to sell my whip to pay for studio time
Made a name, made some change, got respect, got some fame
Now they love our shit, cuz we made our own lane
Tryna sign everybody, put some money in their pockets
Had a ball on the rug, every night we had it poppin'
They ain't hold us down, did it on our own
With our backs on da wall, we put plaques on the wall
Then the problems started picking up, posse start splitting up
People started switching up, we still not giving up
I love them though, we been through it all
They're my brothers though, now that's some real shit
We weren't always rich, we didn't have a pot to piss
Hustle harder than a bitch, slanging records like they bricks
From the ground to the throne, its been a hell of a trip
Bring me one more drank, while I sit and reminisce[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Break a 9 to a bunch of dimes then you grind up
Money got me showin my ass can't even hold my pants up
20 niggas standin on the flat all getting off
Found a junkie dead in Brooke Lake with his hands sawed
Try me in the 6 I'm gone raise this 45 up
Shave a brick put it back together that's a lineup
Remix the chick use a little cut that's a temp fade
And if he got a chopper never ever bring a switchblade
I'm a multimillionaire I gotta couple hundred on me
And I'm a mack I tote a strap I make you stick yourself like tony
I'd give a nigga my whole stash if he can take this jewelry off me
And I'm so bossy in my office smoking Kush and sipping coffee

[Hook: K Camp]
They said I couldn't get rich out here bet money
All that sideline talk don't make no money
Bout that bread y'all niggas out here too funny
Hit yo bitch then leave her with no money

[Verse 2: K Camp]
Money is the motive if you speak it then I'm with ya
Any sideline nigga they get cropped out the picture
If you ask me yeah I'm ready
Got your ho on a mission
Catch me running through your city like a damn politician
Boy I'm all about a check
She don't ask no questions
Boy she all about the neck
Say she wanna crash
So I let my partners wreck
Lookin at a nigga that stay flyer than a jet
They don't hear me yet
I'mma get that check bet money
Y'all niggas out here funny
You know a young nigga on the go
Gotta have that green like Gumby
I'm a fool with the dough too clumsy
On the clock Monday through Sunday
Everyday I gotta get that money
And I learned that from the big homie

[Hook: K Camp]

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
I'm like eleven of them back give me that fucking walkie talkie
Then you lost me when you said you'd never cross me then you crossed me
And these hoes catch the vapors like Biz Markie
And since they brought me these keys, niggas idolize me
Critics criticize me, haters sabotage me
I get angry then I come through in a camouflaged v
Better recognize that my killers ain't gonna jeopardize me
I know these fuck niggas wish they could paralyze me

[Hook: K Camp][Hook: K. Camp]
Nigga, I’ma live like it’s my last
You worried bout them bitches we done had
Baby I’m so focused on this cash
I said baby I’m so focused on this cash
I said she wanna roll cause she see me in that ride
I ain’t got no time, gotta put her on the side
You can’t come between it, between it
You can’t come between it
Baby I’m so focused on this cash

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
VS bezel my Ro', perfected my role
Focused my mind, and got to this dough
I'm one of a kind, not like what you know
True to my oath, they proud of my growth
I come from the turf, I doubled my worth
I made some mistakes, but that’s just part of my search
They connect with my words, right at the part where it hurts
This life is a bitch, my hand up her skirt
Had a thirst to get rich, couple stains on my shirt
Every reason to fail, but we was makin' it work
We was walkin' on water, you could say it was church
All this money I’m makin',  every day I’ma splurge
Boy!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
We on that Clicquot and kush, all yo buttons, I push
We pull up in that Benz, all them pictures they took
Paparazzi gone flock, that's cause both of us hot
Ain’t no limit like Percy, but we like Jada and Pac
Let’s invest in these stocks, let’s vacate on these yachts
Let’s go chill out in Bali, let's make a tape and let’s watch
Let’s by two of those watches, let’s go do it on Collins
Let’s fly out to Atlanta, you play that role, got you poppin'
I fuck wit yo style, you should be somebody stylist
Every time we have sex, you makin' noises the loudest
Faces you makin', paper I’m chasin'
If I make you my girl, you ask if I could be faithful
I’m stuck to these streets, I'm sprung on this loot
Addicted to crime, but I’m attracted to you
Pull up in that Porsche, then hop in that coupe
Pull off in that Benz, it's me and that’s you (uh)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Nipsey Hussle]
Girl yo sex the best, hickies on yo neck
Love the way you dress, plus that pussy wet
Do it 'til you sweat, and yo hair a mess
Have you late for work, but you been carin' less
You been livin' more, you been lettin' go

Down, down, down, down, down, down
I'ma break that bitch down
Down, down, down, down, down, down

[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
Pull up in the car
Then let up the arms, suicide doors
I'm married to the game, never gettin' a divorce
Get in, baby this a coupe, ain't no room to fit your friend in
Red bottom, whatever, your Christian, who is 'Boutin?
Kinda new to boutiques and I don't do the salons
Swag kinda simple, I'm cute in Louis Vuitton
I'm headed to the 'telly, I wanna see you perform
No hood on the car, workin' on your vocals
Threesome after drinkin', grab a condom, we in motion
Break your bitch down, leave her sleepin' on the sofa
In the kitchen, broke a brick down, she ain't even know it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
Out of town for the weekend, accompanied by three friends
I'm supplyin' all y'all drinks then
Vacationin' from work, end up takin' time off
Had to break up with her guy and feel like all men are dogs
Tequila kickin' as we talk and we talk
If she ain't feelin' it, she would've been walkin' off
I'm about to 'scape away, she don't leave
All I did was ask Sabatha, she won't eat
Hotel room vacant, alone, she don't sleep
Clothes off, on the sheets, provided we underneath
Hollerin' in between, I don't get tired
But wonderin' why you sleep

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kevin Gates]
Opposite of normal
I'ma get her number, be a week before I call her
I can see the future and I'm just bein' honest
What I gotta do? I ain't tryna meet your mama
I'ma get her loose, then I slang her this iguana
Actin' like she don't but I know she really wanna
Break the bitch down if she ask of my karma
Won't pick up the phone, make her turn into a stalker
Put her out the car, don't perform and you're walkin'
You was actin' bad, buy the part, don't be heartless
You are not a star to a king and regardless
You don't have a car and a section 8 apartment

Period, you say I ain't the man then you're delirious

You ain't shit, actin' like you faithful but you're everybody's bitch
Everybody done hit, everybody did somethin'
Your ass butt naked, that's why I cut you off
I know the situation, I don't need no explanations
Lyin' to me like I was slow, bitch this ain't The Matrix
I got the naked pictures, yeah the ones you sent to everybody
You was hoin' so much, a nigga couldn't care about you

[Verse 3: K Camp]
You thought I was playin' when I cut that bitch off
I'm just tryna get inside that hole like you're golf
Oh that girl too nasty, she gon' suck it 'til it's soft
Runnin' 'round with balls, woulda thought this was lacrosse
You can't tell me ain't the hottest in your city, that I know
I see these niggas hatin' but they love it on the low
Every city that I hit, them bitches, they're in the front row
I asked myself "Why he mad", but I found out that's his ho, that I know

[Hook: K Camp]

[Outro: Too $hort]
Real playas represent
Yeah mane, you know, it's like that sometimes
Look
It's over, yeah it's nothin' to me
I fucked with you, and you fucked it all
So it's over, bitch(Verse)
She the quint essential thot, she the quint essential thot
And if she ain't fucking with me then I cut that bitch off
Quit trying to talk to me you ain't even my main ho
Quit trying to run your mouth that ain't what I came for
Don't blow up my phone unless you offering a blowjob
Don't be catching feelings I got no tears and no sobs
You were getting old fast so I got me a reissue
So get it through your skull that we done and I don't miss you
After one night our relationship has ran its course
So get your ass up out my bed and walk right out of my front porch
Cause when the pussy ain't good man I would rather jerk off
So that's why it ain't nothing for me just to cut that bitch off
Biotch[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Ok it started with a nigga that just had them hoop dreams
Then I fell in love with music I was only 13
Grab the mic started flowing plenty doubted I kept going
Plenty years in that booth perfecting craft I had to show em
While y'all sleeping I was working all night getting it in
Mama looking at me crazy cuz I failed a class again
Couldn't work a 9 to 5 cuz that shit ain't for me
In my head had vision one day i'll be on TV
Putting on for side but I knew I had to grind
It ain't happen overnight man this shit took sometime
Stayed focus had a dream then I hit them billboards
And I'm only getting started I gotta plan nigga what's yours
(4real)

[Hook]

With these bitches they gone love yo ass until u broke
That's why the only thang she get from me is that good stroke
Love will get you killed I'm cold inside just like a freezer

Yo ho gone let me slide through don't need no visa
First they hated then I turned they asses to believers
Damn in due time(in due time) i'll be fine(I'm good)

We can start off on this floor
End up on that bed
You rubbin' through my head
While I’m all between yo legs
I'mma hit it from the front, back, side, side
Girl I love the way you
Do it (x6)
Girl I love the way you do it

[Verse 1: Mykko Montana]
Lil shawty so damn bad
Her shoes matchin' her bag
Her nails matchin' her feet
Lil shawty sho unique
She rubbin' on my back
I’m rubbin' on her thighs
Her tongue off in my ear
I'mma take it up to first gear
Now we don’t like that freaky shit
But tonight I might just will
Cut the radio off
I’m bumpin' that Johnny Gill
She said Mykko you nasty
I said no I’m just real
She started playin her role
This shit just got too real
I tied up my dreads
Then fell off in her legs
She slowed me down then sat me down
Then started givin' me head
No personally I don’t know this bitch
But I’m diggin' all her ways
She 5'2" and I’m 6'4"
I’m goin in MJ
I bend hER over she threw it back
I'm grippin' on her waist
She turnt up, yeah that cool but I ain't tryin' catch no case (shut up)
We was in the bed now we on the floor kicking everything out the way (well damn)
Too many cameras and this bitch got a showin' down OK (right now)
She said open my set drive can last all damn day (for real)
I write down do you take a break this shit we doing ain't safe (I'm tired)
We been going in for a couple hours I like the way you taste (and ummm)
Big old ass lil' slim waist she fine as hell in the face

[Hook: K Camp]

[Verse 2: Mykko Montana]
When I hit the club I’m coolin'
A bad bitch I’m persuin'
She in park but her ass be movin'
Too turnt up and I can’t stop groovin'
One look at it and she can’t stop lookin'
Girl Scout swag, she ain’t sellin' cookies
Dancin' on the pole, she playin' with that pussy
Don’t shoot me down baby girl I’m like cupid
So she shoved him off that pole
And told me something I should know
The music loud she was talkin' low I couldn’t understand this ho
So I told shawty go change clothes and meet me back right here
Don’t say a word just grab your bag so we can disappear
She said bet and I said cool
Later on we was at The Twelve
She don’t drink lean but she smoke loud
So we burned down the whole hell
See you the type I might take home and let you spend the night
But I don’t know yet
It's our first date
Let me think about it aight!
So we in the whip on 75 trynna figure out the move
She said aye and I said what
She gone ask me what we gone do
Come lay ya head on my lap and do somethin' you barely don’t do
She said bet then she got loose and blew the top off of that Coochie

[Hook: K Camp][Hook]
Don't blame me, just blame yo' bitch (x4)
I can't help she want a nigga (x2)
So don't blame me, just blame yo' bitch
Don't blame me, just blame yo' bitch (x3)
I can't help she want a nigga (x2)

[Verse 1]
Don't blame me, just blame yo' bitch
Yeah, she stuck, Lilo and Stitch
I'm a dog, call up Mike Vick
I blame the toilet for this shit
I'm in her box just like some Rick's
Put it on her chest just like some Vick's
You can't fuck around with me
Yo' bread too small like crystal chicks
Yo' bitch real thick like a bowl of grits
I hit that once and now I'm pissed
Cause I need to touch that twice
That pussy tight like a muhfuckin' fist
She tryna bite like a muhfuckin' pit
Slapped her on the head, said stop that shit
I don't need no teeth on me
But yo' ho like a leech on me, she stuck

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
She on her job, she cannot stop
You was in the picture but you got cropped
I heard yo' girl was a one-stop shop
Like a BB gun, that bitch gon' pop
A lil' bit of money, she gon' shake like locks
Bitch, I ain't got time, yeah, I broke my clock
You say you don't suck no dick, you lyin'
That ho too funny, call up Chris Rock
I heard all eyes on me like Pac
Like wires in the rain, I'll leave that bitch shocked
Just say the word, it's going down like Joc
Black steel in my jeans, no, it ain't no Glock
A young nigga slick, move around like a fox
These hoes coming out of nowhere, chickenpox
I can't help yo' girl looked twice
But check this out, this some advice

[Hook][Hook]
I know a lot, but there's some things I dont know
Don't know no bitch that I can't hit, don't know no chick that say no
Don't know no chips that I can't get, don't know no whip I can't own
Shit, I know a lot, but there's some things I dont know
Don't know no ugly bitches
Don't know no broke niggas
Don't know no snitch niggas
Don't know no bitch niggas
There's some things I don't know

[Verse One: Kevin Gates]
Don't know nobody leaning harder, Phantom bought while out in Florida
Condo out in Georgia, my little daughter died in this water
Don't know nobody who ain't retarded
Know there's a name, don't know what to call it
Activist flowing like a faucet, 40's my precaution
Don't know who can't afford to take a trip when they get bored
Keep they chick in Michael Kors, wake up in designer stores
Infinity trucks be pulling up, Louis luggage on the floor
Ain't being searched by TSA, private jets we finna board

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Yo Gotti]
Don't know no car that I ain't got
Don't know no crib I can't buy
Killing case
Don't know no war I won't fight
Don't know no work I won't sell
I know niggas facing L's but my niggas won't tell
Don't know no bitch that I can't fuck
Don't know no ho I did save
I ain't never been no trick [but that's how I was raised?]
I know broke niggas and they hate all the time
I like ratchet bitches but that bitch gotta be fine

REST COMING SOON!

[Verse Three: K Camp]
I don't like no bitch niggas
I can't stand no hoes, nigga
I know a lot but it's some things I don't know
Don't know no chick I can't bust for my whole team she gon' go
Don't know no snakes, can't fuck with them
I keep my grass oh so low
Shit, I know a lot but it's some things I don't know
Don't know no broke niggas
Don't know no snitch niggas
But I know your bitch nigga
I'm just tryna get rich nigga
And that's all that I know
