[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
It’s Jon Connor, the people’s rapper
Uh, look, ey, start with a dream, young and naïve and then they grow the ambition
Fucked up conditions, put my mom’s in a better position
See I’m the future like a psychic prediction
I’m from the school of hard knocks, shit I did life in detention
I’m from where niggas get shot down, dreams get shot down
Wish the hood would let us live but all we heard was “block out”
Now I’m further than what they believed I’d achieve
‘Cause Flint niggas don’t even want you to have dreams when you sleep
Low expectations, no expectations, know what you facing
Fuck the odds I proved you can get up from under a basement
I been with scandalous bitches that will take you for granted
Roll with scandalous niggas only taking advantage
People take your kindness for weakness, taking you through the ringer
It’s a gang bang, life is a bitch and it’s not a pre-nup
Life is dirty, shit box dirty, and we’re playing clean-up
Go through the Ike & Tina, before the Martin & Gina
I play follow the leader and I done swam with the sharks made it out the Aquafina
Niggas turned into leeches, turned these swamps into beaches
My people saying "Eureka!", niggas pretend, they hate you, they despise you, they ain’t you
Niggas is full of shit that’s why they probably empty
God promised a feast how you gon’ tempt me with Denny's
Niggas and bitches rats, stay away from mickey's and minnie’s
I fend for this city, when I ain’t have a friend in this city
Adding in your two cents? I’ll show you what to do with them pennies, look
My intellect been a wreck, crash course on this real shit
In Flint, every day is a Virginia Tech, fuck rating on the internet
Fuck what popping off in comments, pop off in public
My niggas is into that, Jon Connor AVM, Aftermath, best in the world nigga!

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
Uh, Jarren Benton, half-man, half-tyrannosaurus
I wasn’t born I was thrown out a spaceship in Atlanta in an abandoned forest
The Grizzly bear trapped Goldilocks in a pan of porridge
I call my name and you’re fuckin’ scared you can’t ignore us
Go get a damn thesaurus, the preacher, the son of God
Only way you fuckin’ with Mister Benton, no façade
I put a man in the desert sand, that’s no mirage
I go gambit on niggas and pull your poker cards
I go loco mark open heart surgery, with no power tools
A fuckin’ monster, I will devour you
I’m Cujo and cocaine with rabies in them
These kids dying like Casey Anthony babysitting
I’ll fuckin’ fuckin’ rip  your tonsils out
And throw your dead corpse in a tool shed in my uncle’s house
I got love for Lil' Boosie but free Mumia
These niggas signing like three-sixty deals for two New Kias
Shit, TLC got a Rav-4
You might catch me in a Prius with a bad whore
I snatch a rapper out the sunroof of a Jaguar
You ain’t a spitter, then what the fuck do you rap for?
Niggas like “I ain’t a rapper, I’m a trapper”
Then stay inside the trap or get eaten by the fuckin’ master
Of ceremonies, it's hip hop, with a gold rope and a pair of ponies
Can't grab a bitch by the ponytail ‘cause the hair is phony
Moving from African Gods to Amistad
These niggas going broke is still stunt in they momma’s car
It’s FV twenty-one-four the summer’s ours
And you a bitch in a woman’s skirt, son of a coward
The fireman, I extinguish these niggas out fast
I grew up off of Red, Em, Goodie Mob, and Outkast
I keep the Wu-Tang sword propped on the front seat
That’s your favorite rapper? To me that nigga just lunch meat
Jarren Benton, Rest in Peace Jahmal Pryor

[Verse 3: Lil Bibby]
Uh, Let me talk my shit
Bands in my pocket so I walk like this
Just spent 80 grand when I bought my whip
Lou told me to lease it but I bought my shit
And I came in the game like LeBron James
First the money, and the fame, then the broads came
See your clique, fifty deep, but they all lame
Young nigga stacking books like a card game
They like “How the fuck is he a freshman?”
Young nigga spitting better than the veterans
I need the cover, why the fuck I gotta sit with them?
The whole world know these words ain't compared to him
Uh, yeah the kid’s so cocky, feeling like Ali
Niggas can’t stop me, jackers wanna rob me
Opps wanna pop me, that's why I keep a lil’ bro right beside me
I’m from the Chi, shit real in this motherfucker
Fuck around, get killed in this motherfucker
Paranoid, I can’t chill in this motherfucker
Can’t leave without the steel in this motherfucker
These niggas keep saying “Don’t trip”
Climbing to the top, I just hope I don’t slip
Niggas sending threats and I never been a bitch
So I’m steady buying guns, youngin feeling like tilt
Lil’ Bibby I’m the same old pimp
No more Ramen Noodles, just lobsters and shrimp
I could be in jail tryna talk through them vents
Or running from the cops, probably hopping a fence
But, I’m in the drop with the tints
Flow so sick it don’t make no sense
Niggas be mad I don’t take no pics
Chain so froze I could take your bitch
But I don’t even need ice though
And this that eighty-four mic flow
We don’t rap beef, my squad a little psycho
Plus these rap niggas suck like Lipo
I ain’t forgot about the old me
Straight off the block now I’m ballin’ like Kobe

[Verse 4: Troy Ave]
Troy Ave, with the classic feel
Bands be racking, major without a deal
I’m that nigga, if you got eyes you could tell
You’re seeing me rise, you're seeing me with XX-L
Putting on for my city and I’m doing it well
So much style I should be down with The Stylistics as well
This like BIG and Jay, Troy Ave hit after
I represent the streets, I ain’t these weirdo rapper
Self-paid nigga came from whipping the batter
Hit the bank they like “Who is this young stacker?”
HP, PSB, HE, double-L yes, oh baby, yeah, it’s me
Ho spillers, smooth skinner, dope dealer
Mad niggas be out in New York, my buzz iller
I’m an ill nigga, Dungarees by Hilfiger
As a lil’ nigga coming up, now I’m bigger
In the dope game, then these fraud niggas with rap names
I’m named after my block, Troy Ave mane
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, still in this street thang
We’ll be at the Barclays, Nets vs. Heat game
Man, where these other niggas seats man?
Man, these seats ain’t cheap, man
These other niggas weak, man
Talking ‘bout they proud of me
Pay attention to my moves but I style for free
These bum nigga styles ain’t no style to me
Dickriding never been transportation, B
Powder, Troy Ave biz, we reckless
New York City shit, uh huh[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
I was conceived in Dracula's lair
I'm cracking a hater upside his fucking head with the back of a chair
His feet leaps back in the air
I rip the fur off the back of a bear
The blade's precise I could chop off a patch of his hair
Bitch I am a god, riding on the fucking handle bars
Black BMX, AR15 tear you and your man apart
Go out like Tony Montana, they poppin' them hammers, I fall off the banister
Gargantuan, keep your favourite rappers body parts in a canister
Fuck anybody that doubted me, ever looked down on me
Where the fuck where you? Now you're so proud of me
I've been on a grind, bitch I don't know how to sleep
My crew sick to a crucifix
Smoking kush through a hookah stick
Bite the bullet when the ruger spit
Fuck rap, bitch I'm through with it
Niggas know when I was born to ball
Bitch I’m shining like a marmoreal
Light a stick of dynamite "tick, tick" bang and die right in front of ya'll
I'm done with living
Satan I'll be there in a minute
How the fuck you boxing with god bitch when your arms are missing
No religion but my mom's a Christian
I had her tripping when she found my porn subscription
I'm on some different shit
And expensive whips with a different bitch
I rip your fucking lungs out with a plumber's wrench
I don't know a nigga living in his right mind that could probably stop me
Nigga shook like a young bitch in a room, fucking Bill Cosby
Mach five, nigga high speed, in his face watch his eyes bleed
Pull the plug from the life support and the IV's, nigga try me
Came from the dirt, thank god all the pain it was worth
Thinking my name was cursed, I couldn't get on, I felt so ashamed and hurt
I eat up everything until the fucking reaper gets me
We in this bitch but I still feel depressed and empty

[Hook: Hopsin]
The game's got me in a venomous zone
It's killing my hope, I don't even feel it no mo'
Sometimes I say fuck this shit but I ain't willing to go
Stealing my soul, there's reasons I can't leave it alone (fo so)
My legacy I gotta leave it in stone (you know)
If these other niggas did it we getting on (lets go)
These weak niggas straight up killing my soul
That's why I don't even feel it no mo'
I ain't vibing to it

[Verse 2: Jon Connor]
From the moment my pen hit the page
My vision was getting on stage
Dreaming about it, they told me that this was a phase
You getting too big for your britches, remember your age
Huh? What the fuck that mean?
Tell 'em doubt me they be reading 'bout me
All this passion you would have to beat it out me
And they said I would never leave my county
Kill that noise, I couldn't let them breath around me
All I could ever see is drowning
All I could ever see is drowning
All I could ever see is drowning
Now that ain't no problem but nothing but sharks
I rob 'em, I never needed no help
I should dealt with the fuck I felt
Fuck drowning, I became a shark myself
Momma said keep your head up
My nigga said keep your head up
You hating niggas went head up
I ain't get fed so I'm fed up
Me gettin' signed was a proud day for every chick I got head from
I hope you follow, I'm drunk with power like it's creatine in this red cup
Losing - I refuse it
It's useless like using a toothpick as a pool stick
Somebody hate, ain't give two shits
Just made music till I got hot like when it's humid in Houston
Fuck it
Truth is I don't even know why I do this
I done came so far but I still feel lost and about to lose it

[Hook: Hopsin]
The game's got me in a venomous zone
It's killing my hope, I don't even feel it no mo'
Sometimes I say fuck this shit but I ain't willing to go
Stealing my soul, there's reasons I can't leave it alone (fo so)
My legacy I gotta leave it in stone (you know)
If these other niggas did it we getting on (lets go)
These weak niggas straight up killing my soul
That's why I don't even feel it no mo'
I ain't vibing to it

[Verse 3: Hopsin]
As of lately my fire's been lower
Dizzy Wright said I might
Need to put a light to some weed to get my mind to tremble
But that ain't me so I'm digging real deep to write this shit
Yo I'm at five percent
I hope my career does not die in limbo
I wake up just praying my fuse is lit
Cause I don't get hyped like I used to get
Back when I would hop in the booth and spit
I'm too immune to this
Stuck in my thoughts, am I a lunatic? (fuck)
Fuck this music shit, what is Hopsin? I don't know who it is
I do get bits of spontaneous hunger
And when I do there's a cloud of raining and thunder
You'd hate to get under
And when that happens ain't no place to get comfort
I'm labeled a monster, you may be a goner
I put listeners in the craziest slumber
A note to peasants, my vocal presence
Is so perfected fans get so obsessive
And cry to my shit but don't confess it
When I'm in my zone you feel that power and passion
My godly words can speak louder than action
And don't forget it nigga

[Hook: Hopsin]
The game's got me in a venomous zone

I ain't vibing to itProduced by Statik Selektah

[Hook: Francesca]
Is it real?
Is it fake?
I woke up, suddenly I just woke up

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Look, yo, it only makes sixth sense
They sleep on the creator of Pineal Gland
No offense taken, I’m just racin’, the savior of man
Crucifix, positive, addition, it’s all the same
Given that getting head is cool, but what is it if you don’t use your brain
That’s one plane, negative subtraction, but still a balance
If dyslexic then play this shit backwards
Uh, the black lip captain of the ship
When you dividing the pie, rats come, it’s all math son
So is it really really real? Or do you need to shapen up my G?
I’m a tree, you know peace be still
The irony of my movement, they eyeing my every movement
The pioneer of the future, another Statik selection
With a dab of perfection
Whether it’s wax in your bong or your eardrum
I’m here now, I’m guessing you live in fear now
So be it, when they speak about the real Soul be it, no debate
Don’t just give ‘em the fish, teach ‘em to fish, let ‘em pro-create Shout out to Joey and ‘em, was dope before the cake
I went from selling records out my record shop
To my record selling out the record shop
That’s a paradox like a pair of yachts

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jon Connor]
It’s hard to be optimistic when Connor’s your opposition
Ain’t no competition, you just a confident contradiction
And what I am in the future, refuse to dispute it
I’ll prove it through music and all you dudes can do is salute it
The most authentic, they get lost in it, I spit raw venom
Jump when I say jump, I feel like Kriss Kross, nigga
Never average, cut from different fabric, fans they never last
My shit’s eternal
Moving so fast that I probably won’t notice a hurdle
Look, Best of the best expect nothing less on my quest
To save the game, I’m walking around like there’s an “S” on my chest
It’s Aftermath out here acting bad, I wave the flag
We the only thing moving, the fuck you go’ say to that?
No lies, all truth, make all you call truce
Watch all just fall off like you tossed off a tall roof
For getting this verse off I paid the cost of the lawsuit
‘Cause I keep hitting them hard with these lines and they all through
Connor

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Logic]
Another day another dollar from that 9 to 5
Yeah, you living but ask yourself, are you really alive?
I worked outside, I worked with food, I worked behind the desk
I’ve even hustled around my block, but hold up, I digress
I’ve paid my dues, see this life I didn’t choose
My face on the ten o'clock news, shit I refuse
I was born in a lower class, where gangsters with dough amass
And police would ask questions, but we never answered when asked
Momma bitching while my sister baby daddy cooking crack in the kitchen
Getting rich in the street from slanging prescription
He showed me how to cook it, he showed me how to cut it
But deep down I always knew that life just wouldn’t cut it
So I started writing, it was a dark time
Only fifteen, but the shit I seen would blow your mind
School was getting harder due to my life at home
Principal always calling ‘cause I had barely shown
No father figure, my mother tried her best to be both
But let’s be honest a father really helps with your growth
But I was raised by Nas and Jay-Z and Big L and Eminem
All of them set examples through they lyrics
Listen close so I could hear it, about life and how not to fear it
How to grab the wheel and steer it, and so I
And so I did just that
Word of advice follow your dreams and never look back
I said it’s Logic

[Hook][Produced By: Skrizzly Adams]

[Hook: Skrizzly Adams]
Hey, they're calling
They're calling my name
I got the whole world on fire
And I ain't going away
I been real through all this
Staring straight at the flame
I got the whole world on fire
And I ain't going away
I ain't going away

[Bridge: Chris Webby & Jon Connor]
Standing tall, head high, doing what I wanna do
If I fall, I get up, I done came too far to lose
Pushing through, pick it up, even when my body's tired
I got enough drive inside to set the fuckin world on fire

[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
What can I do for me now
Used to the enemy shooting me down
But truthfully how
Could you try to stop me when truth can be found?
And knowing that life is a lesson
Don't question what you can be now
We let this aggression take over and over and over
A chip on our shoulder bigger, ignore what they told us
I told you I was a soldier (yeah)
Never quit, don't fall, if I do, I apologize y'all
Might slip, won't trip, to be real, shit, I idolize y'all, why?
Cuz if you hear me now you ain't take the easy way out
You knew there was light at the end of the tunnel
When you couldn't see a way out
Faith is what you can't teach, haters may say what you can't reach
As long as I stay playing these beats
At the end of my day, y'all I'm at peace
Peace of mind, Imma just ease my mind
Relieved with the peace I find
And ease my rhymes, I need my time
Somebody out there might need these lines
Yep, I got you, ain't a choice no more, I got to
Ain't nobody thats gone stop you
Don't cry home boy that's not you
Look, when it ain't easy I know that
Been came too close to go back
Your dream is yours, believe that
Yep even when the world can't see that, I see that, that's real

[Hook: Skrizzly Adams]

[Bridge: Chris Webby & Jon Connor]

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
Told myself I got this shit (is this my time?)
Better hope to God it is
Losing my mind, show me a sign
I’m no astrologist but I just need to know
Cause I really put all that I got in this
When all I had was empty bank accounts and broken promises
Life ain’t like the comics, ain’t no Superman to save the day
Ain’t no one to clear the road, it’s on you to pave the way
Get your dreams tatted up, never let em fade away
And toughen up that skin and disregard what all them haters say
Listen I been through all that too
What you think I ain’t been down on my luck?
I’m dealing with shit on the daily, it’s driving me crazy
But I ain’t about to give up
Keeping my family close so I can know everybody around me I trust
Now I got Earth right up in my hands
Get ready cause this shit about to combust, what?
I’m not lying when I say
That the world could end tomorrow, set fire to it today
(HomeGrown)
Ay, we really ain't too different after all
Im tryna find my happy place and you're welcome to tag along

[Bridge: Skrizzly Adams]
I know what it’s like sometimes when you feel like it’s over
Cause everything that’s wrong goes right when it’s all for the fight
Handle yours like a soldier, and make em say…
I know what it’s like sometimes when you feel like it’s over
Cause everything that’s wrong goes right when it’s all for the fight
Give it up like I told ya, and make em say…

[Outro: Chris Webby]
I got, I got, I got the world on fire man
I got, I got, I got the world on fire man
I got, I got the world on fire!

[Hook][Intro]
Listen to me, learn from me
I wasn't the best because I killed quickly
I was the best because the crowd loved me
Win the crowd, and you'll win your freedom
I will win the crowd
I'll give them something they've never seen before

[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
Look, I ain't play games, homie, I ain't got time
Especially when I do this for my homies that done got time
Imma do this for the city, every hot line
Go to every block, every hood, every corner, every stop-sign
I just wanna get it for the days that I was living in the hood
Wait a minute, I don't even know if you can call it living
Pay attention, cause at any given minute
You be chilling with your niggas and be witness to a killing, ho
Grew up on the north side, north side
Nigga to the fullest, I was quicker than a bullet
That was going past the window and saw nothing
And I'm coming for the crime, what the fuck you think I'm here for?
Make no mistake about it, fake shit I can't allow it
Trapped in this game, now I can't get out it
You want that real shit, and I feel the same about it
I was in the trenches just like you
Wondering how the fuck Imma get through
I don't have a plan, but I know one thing:
Gotta get up out of this motherfucker, and I can't lose
Eyes on the prize, and I know I can't quit
Never gonna fail, so I'm on my shit
Gotta keep going and I can't look back
Took on the world and now it's on my back, back
Back up, homie, don't act up
I'm from Fly City where this rap shit really ain't a factor
And when them kilos on your back and make a
Motherfucking backpacker pack up
On some other shit, them was the odds I was up against
So I ain't phased by none of this
Cause in reality, I love that shit
For all the grinding I was doing, I ain't no one you was fucking with

[Bridge]
See, I've been on my hustle for a minute
Now it's really time to get it
So it's only fair I'm letting them know
That I'm a motherfucking animal, it's true
You don't want me coming for you
Just sit back and keep enjoying the show, cause yo

[Hook]
You don't really want it, nah
(Come and step to the floor, you already know
That I'm too cold with the microphone
I'm beastmode, better leave it alone)
You don't really want it, nah
(Cause I came too far to stop
Regardless I’m off the wall, chip off the block
I’m a monster, watch bitch, better call the cops)

[Verse 2: Snow Tha Product]
Welcome to the Hunger Games
You give up your whole life but get tons of fame
There's rappers who don't write but get companies
Making of with their souls for a chunk of change
I got more profits than those, y'all so dumb to chase
But they popped off all the time, but they a bum today
Man, I got that Glock that I tote make you cuff your chain
You see my pockets is gordo, you chubby chase?
I got a plot to take over this continent
While I'm over-thinking, all these bitches are there gossiping
So Imma take a spliff, take a hit, something monstrous
Cause I really quit but I think I've been locked in
And all this bullshit and I'm sick of the politics
I'm gonna show you which really bitch but it's obvious
All of these hoes really want to just party and molly
And violence and bottles and popping and dropping
And opposite, that is just me, are you taunting them?
All they admire us, not in that guapa shit
Alternately, I think I'm gonna stop the gig
Talk to them, all bitches wearing this God-given
Oculus urge of confidence
I'm just subconscious shit trying to make all y'all get y'all bitches
Hearing my shit but I'm not spitting anymore lessons
Bae, do what you wish, I ain't gon' stress
Man, you finna get little Miss Snow from oh wait where I spit
All about selling drugs and the things that I did
Cause I done sell 'tapes and I toured
And I ripped all these stages from East to the West
And these kids and these magazine covers just don't give a shit
What the fuck? You want Product? I'll give you a fix this is it

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
C-Webby be carnivorous, bars rippin', shit
I'm the boss, people be calling me Sarge in this bitch
Make a mess, gotta keep a fucking tarp and a whip
As I keep evolving, just like Darwin predicts
So it's off with his head and I'm off with his chick
Keep it calm till I flip, then I'm off in this bitch
Fuck Dawn of the Dead
Shit I got grown men hiding under their bed
Thinking that monster exist
Cooking up that east coast dough
With a pad and a pen and the words that I wrote
Every syllable invented that's enclosed and in quotes
Are too complex for most folk, but you know
I'm a ghost in the booth, can't see me though
Hard body with the flow, C3PO
Lost track of all the fucking Sour D we rolled
So high, Major Tom can’t reach me bro (Shh)
Yo it's Major Tom and, you don't really want it
So everyone can suck my dick without a condom on it
I'm just full of that chronic, gin no tonic
Couple capsules in my pocket
Know I'm gonna rock it, feeling so right
Going psychotic, they feeling my rhymes
Sipping Hpnotiq, and I'm losing my mind
Roll back another time cause I'm just a...
Motherfucker with the coldest flow
CT to the Poconos, you better hold the phone
Before you leave with a broken nose
I'm so dope that I think I'm 'bout to overdose
Now I'm feelin' like I'm really 'bout to go the road
That ain't chose by most men, so I go alone
Into the dark side
How could I have sold my soul?
I never had one, bitch! Motherfucker, let's go!

[Bridge]

[Hook][Intro]
Yeah, alone with my thoughts
Let me share it with you

[Hook]
They say the good die young, so the bad die old
Guess we somewhere in the middle, so just pray for my soul
All I want to do is right, but all I'm seeing is wrong
And I'm trying to stay strong but its taking its toll
And I ain't no better than you so when you playing this song
And you feeling how I'm feeling, just know that you ain't alone
Everyday you wake up, another day that it's on
So we got to wake up before what we seeing is gone

[Verse 1]
Since the beggining, the mirror of what I've written
Real has been my description, ain't never been nothing different
Love me or hate me, just know its me you lovin' or hatin'
So there will never be an issue with what judgement your making
High school, I knew who I was, I had direction
A leader, I don't follow nobody, always progressing
So every girl in highschool a ho, was the perception
Coz lame niggas lied on their dick, to get accepted
Takin' a girls purity to get a sense of security
Now she insecure, she get older and she ain't sure of me
And I ain't sayin' I'm an angel or saint
But one of these days I might need her to be wifey, but she can't
Coz now she don't trust niggas, all the time fuck niggas
Coz if she don't she thinking then no nigga gon' fuck with her
Both male and female, lost in misdirection
It's a crazy world when you live in a misconception

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
She had the university trying to fit in, blowing intuition
Was a good girl back at the crib, but now she different
Blowin' trees, she was never into it
It's the influence of her roomy, she with it coz all her friends do it
Back home she knew people, now she with these new people
She don't know herself no more, now she feeling like two people
Niggas in the dorm, 3am, thinking they cool people
Trying to keep up with this bullshit can consume people
Talking loud, wrong crowd, ya'll fucking the same dudes
Feeling like you can't move, this painful, this ain't you
You stay loose, cranberry juice and grey goose
Can't shake ya head at them hoes, coz you doing what they do
Niggas play you, too far gone, who gon' save you
Funny how shit could have been, if you had stayed you
Out of control on the path of misdirection
It's the crazy life when you live in misconception

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
The coolest nigga in high school, was exactly that
The coolest nigga in high school, time passed right by you
Passing days of glory, keep telling them war stories
Leaching off baby mommas, he never set his priorities
Already finding, his best days is behind him
The hoes that he used to fuck, is what defines him
Sleeping on different couches, got seeds in three different houses
But if you ask about him, he barely know nothing bout em'
I don't want him around me, all I know about him
Is he broke and he brag about being in and out the county
And since when is not being shit, the shit?
When there's only one life to live, I hope you listen huh?
Still alive, done living at twenty five
Stuck in the hood, but never got out coz he never tried
Look, check your brother, but check yourself first
The truth hurts, but we can all change after this verse

[Hook]

[Outro]
Shit's real... It's too real[Intro - Jon Connor]
2011 is mine, nigga. I just bought it and paid for the motherfucker
You know how we do. I ain't even feel like talking that much

[Verse 1 - Jon Connor]
I'm a change the game, niggas won't get a penny back
I'm a make hits while you motherfuckers pitter pat
Talk is cheap, I'm where the hundreds and fifties at
Legend nigga put me where the diddies and biggies at
Son, yo what you little niggas want to piggyback
Eat you for breakfast the skin off a piggy's back
Ain't no comparison
I'm sick and they be looking for the medicine
All varsity
And you can tell it by the letter, man
Embarrassed them
Keep the game up late
Jay Leno, David Letterman
And with these hoes, I'm like fuck sex
Make them go straight to the head Excedrin
My sentiments - you're sweet, you're cinnamon
This Michigan MC breed Eminem
Yes, he the best, he a pest
Cause you can't get rid of him
But it's for your own benefit
Can't stop making moves, and you niggas on Ritalin
Y'all bark loud 'til the nigga yelled sic'em then
Sick of them because they big fish in a small pond
Nigga call Jon I'll reel em in
Niggas illegitimate. I spit it with a vengeance
Many niggas say they want it
But they really just pretending
They depending on a nigga
But I scream
A-Squad to the end
So many hits that they quitting in the middle of the end
So It got me feeling like I'm winning
Spit it with conviction
Your shitty drawers on par for these infants
Shit, I'm a giant I recline on you midgets
Fuck that
Homie I ain't quit till I finish, I'm a menace
Got to get, kill it, till the world is a witness
Say something wrong and Flint niggas will go in a nigga's mouth like a dentist
Young Jon about his business
Making a mark while I'm shaping the art
Trying to keep it together but I take'em apart
Go play in the dark if you ain't on my team
I make them scream, shit I'm Wes Craven at heart
I ain't coming at you, I'm past you
Flow so wet, make a nigga Kraft food
Glad to stay on you niggas mind like a tattoo
Shitting on you niggas like I couldn't find a bathroom
Back to the game and how I'm gonna fuck it up
Kill every show, now the stage is all bloodied up
We'll make it rain, have your boots all muddied up
School of hard knocks, well you niggas better study us
White walls that will flow insane
Punch lines till they all feel pain
Tight walls till your girl give brain
Put a name tag on them, I'mma forget your names
Get the picture, I'll get your frames
More hot, I'll spit your flames
Flow dope, nigga that's cocaine
Hear my tribe, it's just my lane
International, flow irrational
Mind is sharp, I just ripped your ass in two
Sick, I passed the flu
Caught you in the headlights
I'll mount the other half of you
One more that's on my wall
Haters is on my balls
It was one thing that my dick so tall
But now I really can't put on my drawers
Hell nah, this ain't gon' pass
Who said I ain't gon last
With the same mouth that you said that shit
All of you can tongue kiss my ass

[Outro]
They don't call me the people's rapper for nothing
To everybody that been fucking with me. I'll never let you down, I got you
Y'all know what it is
Blue City Club

Go get Jon Connor as Vinnie Chase Season One. Season Two on the way
That shit with me and Reefa on the way
We goneFt. Jon Connor

[Maffew Ragazino]
Every time he go, he go in like he on Stretch & Bobbito
Circa 93' flow
This rap shit is but a free throw, well ease how I paint portraits, no easel
The word play so lethal as cold as Andre with a Kanye ego
I'm the antidote, even your mama knows
But common sense ain't common amongst common folks
Food for thought, main entrée
But they want microwaveable shit with paper plates
No cosign, no payola, all that shit is fake luv, Angel Lola
And Shawty is cute, I ain't trying to diss
I mean she give me the pussy I prolly hit
Frankie Cutlass wasn't lying about the politics
It's all bullshit, vote republican
Donkey or elephant, I'll tighten my belt before I sell out for my relevance
And fame and money and all those other perks that come with it
That's why still do this shit like it's 1 9 9 5
And I still do this shit like it's 1 9 9 5
And I still do this shit like it's 1 9 9 5
And I still do this shit like it's 1 9 9 5, right

[Maffew Ragazino]
What would have happened if Aaliyah would have flew alone?
Or if Makavelli (Machiavelli) really truly had a clone?
Or if Big Poppa would have stayed his ass at home?
How far could that coast rivalry really gone?
Hypnotize Remix with 2pac on it
Pardon my idle mind, I know I'm really zoning
Whenever you in Rome, they say do as the the Romans
But the industries roam and I'm doing my own shit
Stepping on toes along the way, like fuck it I meant it
You ain't gotta pardon me, like I'm Forte
Seekin refuge, we want our reparations but they refuse
Over your head ain't it, I'm just putting a little paint where it ain't at
Walking the plank damn it with the waters that are sharks infested
I stand the test of time every single time that I'm tested
An empty bottle of cognac with a message, inside of it
Some of ya will get it, but it's obvious that a lot of ya'll prolly won't

And I still do this shit like it's 1 9 9 5
And I still do this shit like it's 1 9 9 5
And I still do this shit like it's 1 9 9 5, right

[Jon Connor]
It's Jon Connor, yo
This shit is gorgeous I kill it I'm morbid
The flow is wet, I spit it, it's pouring
You niggas absorb it the flow is dope
As cuban imported I'm coke when recording
Yes this is straight raw, and you spitting that Norbit
Whether they, shoot it or snort it
I send they brain into orbit
How could a flow this sick be just the doctor ordered
Look, before I sell out, I bail out and Dave Chapelle out
In Africa with Naydee and Seedie speakin swahili
And if it's 1995 then let me get it back, and rip it spit
Like 2 Pac was gon diss me if this shit was whack
Like I'm a bad boy like Martin, Willie and Biggie and Diddy in the back
Mariah on the hook in a Yankee fitted hat
Where my niggas at? Fake niggas better play dead
Ain't Peter Parker but I run shit like I had 8 legs, I'm Forrest Gump-in you
Lieutenant Dan and you got fake legs, and look
They can't keep up cause they feet stuck, put your teeth up when
When I beast up, nigga, what, what, what, what
And I still do this shit like it's 1 9 9 5, right[Verse]
The most consistent and the most convincing
They say I'm gifted like I'm asking what you want for Christmas
Niggas ain't eatin' like they cabinet full of broken dishes
I hope for disses, I just kill it
More reason to make em' float with fishes
I been nicer than the writers that you liking
The brain fool way more than the cyphers that you biting
This a blue diamond, I drop gems, I drop hymns
I got the juice, it feel like Pac' when he popped Steel
You liking these rappers you think that they hot, but they not real
I don't stop when I drop off the top of the knot and get a cop killed
Lookin' for the best in the world, well, I'm here so that slot filled
You niggas suck, you really don't wanna know how Doc feel
This is all varsity, artistry, architect for the art of it
Revampin' the culture, I'm just happy to be a part of it
Got this shit locked, my nigga more bars than the law from it
Flint Michigan listenin', you are witnessin' dominance
Fulfillin' my promises, it ain't even a matter of common sense
The difference between us is obvious
My nigga, just look where the comma sits
For real[Hook: Lia Mack]
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase 25 to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase 25 to life

[Intro]
I guess I asked for this right
I mean that's what they say

[Verse 1: Jon Conner]
I pretend like I don't hurt but ya'll don't know my pain
It's like over the years you just get numb this shit is novocaine
They like Connor why you ain't rich man ya'll don't know the game
It ain't all about rapping and your talent that's what they don't explain
I get called Connor so much that I don't know my name
I get called Connor so much I wanna blow my brains
Just to have someone who can relate go talk to Kurt Cobain
Then I sit back and think of James and I get so ashamed
Before I can gather all my thought's I'm right back on a plane
Staring out the window in the clouds like here we go again
The world expects me deliver hail sleet snow or rain
So my heart bleeds through this pen like I broke a vein
All I talk about now is music all I know is this
My closest friends say that it seems like sometimes I'm emotionless
I think it started when I seen my cousin lie there motionless
Ain't have time to deal with it so I never got over it
I just went back to rhyming back to the studio business as usual
All the while I'm thinking what the fuck do I do this for
For the haters that berate you even though you never met 'em
That wanna see you fail that'll kill your spirit if you let 'em
What? Do it for the the doubters that'll doubt you
When they know nothing about you
Hope they can find your weakness so they can bring it out you
Naw, I don't do it for my enemies or the industry
I do it for the memories
Of those I love and letting them know how much they meant to me

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jon Conner]
For real I be like who do I tell this when I'm feeling helpless
Don't wanna burden nobody with my problems that'd be selfish
I see people with genuine smiles and then I get jealous
A prisoner of passion inside my mind's where jail is
Remember Sam told me you think they hate you now
In this business people build you up just to break you down
They will wait till you're gone why I can't get that thank you now
The attention that you crave will be the same shit that'll take you down
We saw Whitney struggling and did we offer to help her no
We made her a trending topic and just watched her on the TV show
Passing judgement with no repercussion so easy though
Ya'll can do all the tributes you want but she ain't here no more
What we doing? misery and pain is televised and we just tune in like
What cause you do music you ain't human the shit is stupid
I saw Amber Rose crying on MTV and I just watched like
Damn this is entertainment how far will it go before it stop
Your relationship ends and I'm sure you want your space
Their relationship ends the cameras shoved all in their face
Ain't no asking for compassion because your words will go to waste
All the money that they give you don't compare to what they take
Look, Michael gave his whole life that ain't an exaggeration
How'd we thank him for it? With Tabloids and accusations
I done done too much to ever turn from this direction
Ain't shit I can do to change it so I guess I'll just accept it
Damn

[Hook][Hook]
Fuck that! Y'all ain't listen to the shit I say
Woke up today, pushed to edge y'all, and I ain't got time to play
So a nigga like (man fuck that!)
I ain't lyin', might be a riot in this motherfucker
I ain't no killer, I'm just tireder than a motherfucker
So I'm like..

I say no, you don't fuckin' know who you fuckin' with
Nigga no, you don't fuckin' know who you fuckin' with (man fuck that!)
Nigga no, you don't fuckin' know who you fuckin' with
I say no, you don't fuckin' know who you fuckin with, I say..

[Verse 1]
Yo, yo
I planned on quittin' this job from the day y'all hired me
I be talkin' shit, I don't give a fuck
I can't wait till the day y'all fire me
I'm a grown man, stop talkin' loud
What the fuck y'all talk about?
Fuck two weeks, it's been too long, goddamnit I'm walkin' out
So don't complain on my last day if I done tore some shit up
I felt this mornin', y'all lucky I ain't blow this bitch up
Shit..Go to work in my drawers, parking lot, like fuck 'em all
My boss used to say, "Oh, you so quiet"
Bitch, you ain't ever let me talk
I remember days I was sick as fuck and you ain't never let me off
I should'a robbed this bitch
Fuck around, be Vivica, then set it off
I be gone so fast, nigga like holy smokes
Fuck around, get the holy ghost
And you ain't gonna talk to me in any kind of way
I mean I'm tired, let me tell these folks
You should be glad as fuck that I'm leaving
Glad as fuck all y'all still breathing
I had a dream last night
That I busted in and pulled a Django on one of y'all meetings
Co-workers be fake as fuck, talkin' shit, just like me
The boss come in, y'all straighten up
Shit...Nigga we don't make enough, so..

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I swear to God I'll punch heads, these niggas delirious
Ain't nothin I hate more than a fuck boy take they job too serious
These niggas be miserable, like every day
You ain't picked the right job
Nigga your full time is my night job
This my summer job, this your life job
I ain't gettin no rest, so I better get my respect
Cause you talking to me like you crazy, ain't worth gettin' this check
My boss said it bring down around when I act that I ain't there
I said "it take more out of me to act like I fuckin' care"
So fuck this dumb shit, retarded shit, fuck the office politics
Y'all thinkin of ways to improve shit
While I'm thinkin' of ways to get out of this
Shit, I'm convinced we on different paths
There's different ways to keep gettin' cash
A dollar only got so much power and I'm too strong to be kissin' ass
Hold up, I say hold up. Maybe you confused, I don't give no fuck
I don't give no fuck, how did shit end up?
See, old folks used to tell me I'd probably need to say "fuck rap"
But I said, "fuck them, fuck you, fuck this", matter fact..

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yo, yo yo. so I'm like this
Fuck you, fuck this job, fuck that little weak ass check (man fuck that!)
Fuck waking up at motherfuckin' six thirty in the morning every morning
Tell them niggas on the way out, (man fuck that!)
Fuck you, fuck you, it's really fuck you
You aight, you cool, fuck you, I'm outta here
The People's Rapper, AVM, Blue City Club, we outta here man![Hook]
We in the streets playa get your mail
It's only 2 places you'll end up either dead or in jail
With no where to go, no where to go, no where to go
Still no where to go, no where to go,no where to go yeah
Now throw your hands up, hustlers, busters, boosters, hooo
Everybody, fuck that
With no where to go, no where to go, no where to go
Still no where to go, no where to go, no where to go

[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
Yeah look, 2 words fly city, my city
From where if you're not empty you'll be doing 2 words, die quickly
Represent from where the murder rate set precedent, depressing
Crime infested overlooked by the President
Population of minorities, only as free as we can afford to be so we don't make the list of priorities
Nigga, look at where we rest at, naw we don't rest, fact
Cuz it's real that my city, two words, death trap
I do it for the shot up houses, boarded buildings
Niggas order killings more than will and [?] sorry for the children witness dealings while they chillin'
Greasin' [?] on the stove, Momma left you in the morning and she still ain't made it home
Two words, Jon Connor, Don dotta
Niggas look hard but they sweet, niggas cherry hands gobstoppers
I was always taught stay the fuck out of the way
And mind your business before you a victim and your boy turn to the witness
Let's go
[Hook]

[Verse 2:Kap Kallous]
Two words, I am, one word, ozone, don't you, fuck with, two words, my home
I get, stressed out, no dough, get that
Two words, ski mask, duck down, get back
I been, too ill, too long, not to, two words, blow up
I will, not you, since we saying 2 words, I'ma flip em 2 birds
Fuck you, straight up, Kap Kallous, do work, two chicks, went raw
Get shit, got real, weed smoke, two hits, we on, E pills
Two pounds, broke up, B-I-G posters, everyday struggle, favorite song
But hold up, two words ain't enough for me to breakdown the type of shit I be on
Welcome to the mad house, got two doors, choose one, two words good look, look ma, no hands
I done, [?]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mickey Wallace]
I tell em 1 word, absurd, describe these guys, claiming they your mans
Shaking hands, I see through the lies
Two words, mother fucker, bandwagon hitch hugger
Stay the fuck from around suckas, everybody move
Three words, go get it, in a hurry, see the vision making money
Did I mention making money, pay attention
Four words, creeping when I came, fucking up the lane, nothing was the same for educating brains [?]
Five words, Momma was a god damn [?], [?] babies since the 80s, how many of y'all came up like new words to the wise
That's why I write with such a hell of a force
Holla get em when I recite and keep my hand on the pulse of the people
The proper procedure, move a paraplegic, it's a famine, I'm here to feed em
Give em something to believe in, screamin' fuck two tears in a bucket
Learn to stand on our own two, down to [?], stand up and riot
Now we taking what's due, now throw your hands up

[Hook][Verse 1: Maffew Ragazino]
Ragazino, S-R, period
Ain't a nigga better than him, period
Purists got me confused for a backpack syndicate
When I'm planning to take over the whole fucking business
The Great Black Hope, it's Maffew, bitches
Either I'm The One or The Matrix has glitches
How dare you speak on the illest
And neglect to mention that I'm the best
What the fuck? Do I gotta die to convince 'em?

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
A thousand miles apart
Just two degrees from a straight line
Bottles of vintage hanging, clinging from the grapevine
Olives pressed, greenish on the glimmer
Get me on the court, shoot from anywhere like Jimmer
Barrel revolution, spinning like a hula hoop
All these rappers breakfast
Steaming up the yuca root
Queens native, mention with the greats already
Don't even talk to me unless the fucking paper ready

[Verse 3: Homeboy Sandman]
Not another insecure MC, thank God
Peter, this is a phat beat, nice job
Congrats on the engagement to Lex, too
I'll be at the wedding shaving piraguas off the ice swans
The last part shouldn't sound bizarre
You've been in New York City long enough
You should know what piraguas are
The last bar that I'm writing
Is...I laugh while I'm fighting

[Verse 4: Kaimbr]
Flag of that new Confederate slash helter shit, uh
The concrete the color of Welch's
Flow so cold and my hope is that your name come in
Serve rhymes over crushed Red Velvet
Ma, circulate your pelvis
Show 'em how to ride it
Couldn't bury me like Elvis
Melt 'em, uh, I'm with the elders
Teeing off at Elkridge
Flights on my right
Minus off something Keltic

[Verse 5: Jon Connor]
I'm Troy Aikman and Pat Bateman
You Clay Aiken
Every flow is shocking
Take this taste to the face
Face it
I make hits in this game word to the 3rd Bassment
Every verse, not a verb wasted
With words, I'm a superb Jason
Murder tracks
Fuck walking in my shoes
You couldn't even lace 'em
Niggas gassed, I deflate 'em
I eat 'em early, they bacon
I'll burn a spot until it feel like it's baking
Think I'm scorching now?
My future's hotter than a Satanist
Haha![Verse 1: Jon Connor]
They keep askin me, "Connor why you keep on putting out so much music?"
Cause the more I shit on the game the more they try to refuse it
I drop whenever I want cause I got the talent to do it
Imma prove you fucking doofus, keep thinking I'm a loser. (x3)

This the criteria when you feel like people ain't hearing ya
Mixtape every two months, god damn is this nigga serious, yea
Cuz now I feel like they backed me into a corner
They keep tryna fuck me feel like they backed me into a porno
Peep it, you motherfuckers ain't blind, I know u see it, while I go
So hard, look what I got to compete with
Whack niggas with deals with multi-millionaire dollar budgets
Niggas with co-signs, that shine, cause of who they fuck with
Sons and daughters of artist that make cause of they fathers
And whether they're good or not they gon' see B.E.T regardless
But I never get discouraged, keep going, I go the hardest!
Shit I'm just a kid from Flint tryna make it caught up in all this

[Hook: Jon Connor]
This what it feels like
When its real life
When the only way to survive is to kills mics (is to kill mics)
So I kill mics (so I kill mics)

[Verse 2: Jon Connor]
Yeah yeah yeah yah yah
Why would I write this? Knowing half these people in the game would not like this
But they really don't like me anyway
So when I say
"it's looking like you niggas in the motherfucking crisis!"
Cause I be spitting real and my voice is not high-pitched
And I dont wear jeans that are tighter than a vice grip
I like to wear jeans that I can pull-up over my dick
Reconz, I got drive like I drive without a license
Niggas on my dick and talking shit just like my side bitch
I don't want alot I just wanted a shot
I won't stop being hot whether you like it or not
I'm too good to be true, too good to be you
I'm too good for my own good
And I will not end up back in the hood
I'm tryna add it up
Maybe I wasn't wack enough
Or maybe my raps ain't bad enough
Or maybe I ain't said swag enough
But at the end of this, I'm the motherfuckin heir to the throne
Ain't afraid to take a stand even if I'm standin alone, gone

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jon Connor]
To anyone who inquire
I am here to inspire
Thats why when I cypher its hot shit like I'm lighting a diaper
I keep proving I got bars like im writing in rankers
Circle with life is what eight to nine priors behind them
Back in the day you do an album in a year you were straight
Now you gotta drop a song every day to be great
The niggas start falling off just tryna keep up the pace
And in a sense it be values all the music we make
So I guess, this is the part of the record when I direct us
Cause I'mma tell you right now just how long you can expect this
'Till the world know my name, and everybody respect it
Pull off, my strongest effort, I gotta make 'em accept it
And when they do, just know exactly where my mind is
Still making sure every rhyme is timeless
A mixtape is a vehicle for each of my goals
But my albums is a piece of my soul
SO GET READYProduced by Statik Selektah

[Hook: Francesca]
Is it real?
Is it fake?
I woke up, suddenly I just woke up

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Look, yo, it only makes sixth sense
They sleep on the creator of Pineal Gland
No offense taken, I’m just racin’, the savior of man
Crucifix, positive, addition, it’s all the same
Given that getting head is cool, but what is it if you don’t use your brain
That’s one plane, negative subtraction, but still a balance
If dyslexic then play this shit backwards
Uh, the black lip captain of the ship
When you dividing the pie, rats come, it’s all math son
So is it really really real? Or do you need to shapen up my G?
I’m a tree, you know peace be still
The irony of my movement, they eyeing my every movement
The pioneer of the future, another Statik selection
With a dab of perfection
Whether it’s wax in your bong or your eardrum
I’m here now, I’m guessing you live in fear now
So be it, when they speak about the real Soul be it, no debate
Don’t just give ‘em the fish, teach ‘em to fish, let ‘em pro-create Shout out to Joey and ‘em, was dope before the cake
I went from selling records out my record shop
To my record selling out the record shop
That’s a paradox like a pair of yachts

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jon Connor]
It’s hard to be optimistic when Connor’s your opposition
Ain’t no competition, you just a confident contradiction
And what I am in the future, refuse to dispute it
I’ll prove it through music and all you dudes can do is salute it
The most authentic, they get lost in it, I spit raw venom
Jump when I say jump, I feel like Kriss Kross, nigga
Never average, cut from different fabric, fans they never last
My shit’s eternal
Moving so fast that I probably won’t notice a hurdle
Look, Best of the best expect nothing less on my quest
To save the game, I’m walking around like there’s an “S” on my chest
It’s Aftermath out here acting bad, I wave the flag
We the only thing moving, the fuck you go’ say to that?
No lies, all truth, make all you call truce
Watch all just fall off like you tossed off a tall roof
For getting this verse off I paid the cost of the lawsuit
‘Cause I keep hitting them hard with these lines and they all through
Connor

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Logic]
Another day another dollar from that 9 to 5
Yeah, you living but ask yourself, are you really alive?
I worked outside, I worked with food, I worked behind the desk
I’ve even hustled around my block, but hold up, I digress
I’ve paid my dues, see this life I didn’t choose
My face on the ten o'clock news, shit I refuse
I was born in a lower class, where gangsters with dough amass
And police would ask questions, but we never answered when asked
Momma bitching while my sister baby daddy cooking crack in the kitchen
Getting rich in the street from slanging prescription
He showed me how to cook it, he showed me how to cut it
But deep down I always knew that life just wouldn’t cut it
So I started writing, it was a dark time
Only fifteen, but the shit I seen would blow your mind
School was getting harder due to my life at home
Principal always calling ‘cause I had barely shown
No father figure, my mother tried her best to be both
But let’s be honest a father really helps with your growth
But I was raised by Nas and Jay-Z and Big L and Eminem
All of them set examples through they lyrics
Listen close so I could hear it, about life and how not to fear it
How to grab the wheel and steer it, and so I
And so I did just that
Word of advice follow your dreams and never look back
I said it’s Logic

[Hook][Verse 1: Jon Connor]
Come with me if you will, if I could take you back in time
Back in high school, hitting skins was the only thing on my mind
Eleventh grade, boy, you couldn't tell me shit, I was in my prime
Moms blocking your cell phone, tired of girls tying up the line
I mean, I spent so much time trying to get ass and, yeah, I did
I think back, I thank the Lord, I wasn't ready to have no kid
I'm on the phone till five in the morning, knowing I gotta get up early for class
Mama said I need to slow down, but I told her all these girls so fast
Look, all these girls so fine, all these girls got to be mine
So many times I said, "It's only you," knowing damn-well I was lying
Saying, "I love you," and, "It's just you," I ain't even gotta touch you
Running that game, nah, girl, I ain't even tryna rush you
I ran into this chick I used to hit, aw yeah, she was bad
Now she got five babies, four baby-daddies, yo, this shit's sad
Now I think back to them times I used to make an empty promise
I think, "Is this my fault?" Shit's just weight on my conscious, for real

[Hook: Lia Mack]
The weather changes winds, they blow
Sun will shine amidst the snow
If only chose how we fall
It'd be too easy to brush it off
So it ends, and it begins
So it ends, and it begins
So it ends, and it begins
So it ends...

[Verse 2: Jon Connor]
Beauty is her gift, and her beauty is her curse
Look, between home and school, she don't know which one is worse
Every nigga tryna hit it so she don't know what she worth
When she gave it to her first, he went around saying he hit it first
Now, picture that, now she bitter
Her daddy used to hit her
Yeah, nigga had a temper
Used to get touched on by the babysitter
All that shit's still in her
But we ain't tripping, we just walk on by
Wave when we say hi
But what's inside, made her use her bathroom breaks to go and cry
We don't ask, so she don't tell, so she figures nobody cares
Teen years have us isolated thinking nobody there
Insecure about what to wear
She hates the person that's in the mirror
But as a teen, all we seen was light skin with pretty hair
Teachers used to think that she was fast, all cos of how she looked
But jealousy don't stop just cos they grown, you'll learn that in no book
Her beauty was a burden
On the inside, she was still hurting
Never found herself and now she grown and still searching
It was...

[Hook: Lia Mack]

[Verse 3: Jon Connor]
She had posters all on her wall
Of her favourite artists, she'd call
Her girl to pick her up when she want to go catch niggas down at the mall
Don't judge a book by its cover
I say judge a book by the authour
What no God is there if my father
Wanna go hit the club with his daughter
Daughter probably 'bout just as lost, she ain't got no chance
Just a victim of circumstance
None of this shit was in the plans
Nah, not still living at home with her moms
Not get knocked up by no slob
Niggas spend all day playing 2K, ain't thinking about no job
They say, "Girl, getchu an athlete," like that mentality helps
She takes all kinds of abuse, dude, she don't know how to fend for herself
Her mouth will tell you all kind of lies, but her eyes will tell you the truth
Behind that pretty face, there's so much pain that we never knew
And that's... Real!

[Hook: Lia Mack][Intro - Jon Connor]
2011 is mine, nigga. I just bought it and paid for the motherfucker
You know how we do. I ain't even feel like talking that much

[Verse 1 - Jon Connor]
I'm a change the game, niggas won't get a penny back
I'm a make hits while you motherfuckers pitter pat
Talk is cheap, I'm where the hundreds and fifties at
Legend nigga put me where the diddies and biggies at
Son, yo what you little niggas want to piggyback
Eat you for breakfast the skin off a piggy's back
Ain't no comparison
I'm sick and they be looking for the medicine
All varsity
And you can tell it by the letter, man
Embarrassed them
Keep the game up late
Jay Leno, David Letterman
And with these hoes, I'm like fuck sex
Make them go straight to the head Excedrin
My sentiments - you're sweet, you're cinnamon
This Michigan MC breed Eminem
Yes, he the best, he a pest
Cause you can't get rid of him
But it's for your own benefit
Can't stop making moves, and you niggas on Ritalin
Y'all bark loud 'til the nigga yelled sic'em then
Sick of them because they big fish in a small pond
Nigga call Jon I'll reel em in
Niggas illegitimate. I spit it with a vengeance
Many niggas say they want it
But they really just pretending
They depending on a nigga
But I scream
A-Squad to the end
So many hits that they quitting in the middle of the end
So It got me feeling like I'm winning
Spit it with conviction
Your shitty drawers on par for these infants
Shit, I'm a giant I recline on you midgets
Fuck that
Homie I ain't quit till I finish, I'm a menace
Got to get, kill it, till the world is a witness
Say something wrong and Flint niggas will go in a nigga's mouth like a dentist
Young Jon about his business
Making a mark while I'm shaping the art
Trying to keep it together but I take'em apart
Go play in the dark if you ain't on my team
I make them scream, shit I'm Wes Craven at heart
I ain't coming at you, I'm past you
Flow so wet, make a nigga Kraft food
Glad to stay on you niggas mind like a tattoo
Shitting on you niggas like I couldn't find a bathroom
Back to the game and how I'm gonna fuck it up
Kill every show, now the stage is all bloodied up
We'll make it rain, have your boots all muddied up
School of hard knocks, well you niggas better study us
White walls that will flow insane
Punch lines till they all feel pain
Tight walls till your girl give brain
Put a name tag on them, I'mma forget your names
Get the picture, I'll get your frames
More hot, I'll spit your flames
Flow dope, nigga that's cocaine
Hear my tribe, it's just my lane
International, flow irrational
Mind is sharp, I just ripped your ass in two
Sick, I passed the flu
Caught you in the headlights
I'll mount the other half of you
One more that's on my wall
Haters is on my balls
It was one thing that my dick so tall
But now I really can't put on my drawers
Hell nah, this ain't gon' pass
Who said I ain't gon last
With the same mouth that you said that shit
All of you can tongue kiss my ass

[Outro]
They don't call me the people's rapper for nothing
To everybody that been fucking with me. I'll never let you down, I got you
Y'all know what it is
Blue City Club

Go get Jon Connor as Vinnie Chase Season One. Season Two on the way
That shit with me and Reefa on the way
We gone[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
Who wanna see where the fuck I'm from?
Let's take a trip so you can see just how far I've come
From where making it out is like you breaking out of a cell
From where real niggas did either got shot up or in jail
Rap niggas talk about murder, but murder is not for talking
If niggas was talking in my hood, then them niggas is barely walking
You tryna swim with the sharks but you niggas is soft as a dolphin;
You rapping and you ain't 'bout action
You acting, you Dustin Hoffman, you stuntin' Steve Austin also
You outta proceed with caution
Cops'll run in your house, yellow tape around your apartment;
Money under the matress, dope up under the carpet
Get caught quick
I seen hoes get niggas wet up
Pillow talk with you missus, this bitch is part of the set up
Niggas is plottin', niggas is rotten they kill they own folks
No respect for shit niggas cussin' in front of old folks
Grown folks is part of the problem, part of the gossip
Instigatin' is this the deciding factor in why they got shot up
My auntie still play the number and hoping she hit the lotto
So she could get dressed up and take that trip to Chicago
Tires screech in the night and gunshots immediately follow
I know niggas in condos that solve they problem with [?]
Everyday conversation could lead to interrogation
A barbershop confrontation could lead to incarceration
Being ratchet is a religion 'cus they don't know nothing different
And bitches just being bitches, they bitching about they business
She seen it, she know who did it, a witness;
Good thing she didn't believe in snitching, cus if she do
Consequences relentless
Baggy jeans, long tee's, big coats, fitted hats
Country hood, civic hood, fuck it where my niggas at?
Westpad, Pearson Hood, Mearl Hood, Shelby hood [??????]
Every hood that took a loss wish we could get our niggas back
Figure that my nigga then you figure every niggas' strap
Can't relax they just react, be careful how your niggas act
So I'm putting on, Fly City is my home, 'till the day that I'm gone
Uh uh ohn

[Hook: Jon Connor]
And here's another hit, Barry Bonds
[hey hey hey hey hey hey]
We outta here baby
We outta here baby
JC so outta here baby!
Yeah!

[Verse 2: Justin Daye]
I used to sing in the choir
Unlike others the shit I wore wasn't the cleanest attire
Told niggas that I could rap, I was seen as a liar
Now I'm out in Cali with broken[?] everything I desire
I'm more, Jackie than Barry Bonds
A pioneer to a city of people holding on
The typical story of a home with a single mom
Knowing life would be better if Papa wasn't gone
If 'Pac and Big wasn't dead I probably would call 'em Dad
The substitutes for the father I really never had
Not to exaggerate the situation
I used to visit, he even came to my graduation
In elementary I had his interest and admiration
For writing lyrics, now I'm dependent on entertainment to make a living
'Cus Eminem said "Lose Yourself in the moment"
And never expect to get a favor back when you loan it
Success is a bitch because she never comes when you want it
Just know it exists
It's relief like letting it out, when you holding a piss
Truth be told I could give a fuck about a top five list
I got two friends in the grave
Mamma feel like a slave
Sister going to school, and I'm really proud of her grades
And me, I'm trying to escape the nightmare of minimum wage
Cus lyrically, I think I'm the illest nigga my age
But two hundred projects from rap niggas are released every day
So shit...

[Hook: Justin Daye]
Ha ha ha
[hey hey hey hey hey hey]
We outta here baby
Uh
We outta here baby
Uh
We outta here baby![Hook: D Wayne]
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world where they can be alone
Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out to me? I'm reaching out to you

[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
It feel like I ain't got common sense
All the years trying to conquer this
Been on the grind so long, worked so hard
Still feel like I ain't accomplished shit
All the time I struggled, soul got humbled
Hard for me to take a compliment
Cause I'm from Flint, when young people die
They say 25 is an accomplishment
When I turned 18, left my home
Packed my bags, said "I'm gone"
Mom wanted me to stay home but I'll never be grown if I don't do this on my own
She had my back, gave her last
Even when all she had was scraps
Now I'm in Florida, don't know nobody
Got a clean slate gotta start from scratch
Oh Lord how I land on my feet
? wheels I remember weeks
I was too proud to call home for money so I toughed it out and I just ain't eat
Little cous' died seen him in my dreams
Crying all night so I just ain't sleep
Probably needed therapy, but it cost too much
So I told ? play that beat

[Hook]
For my people that know what it's like to be a starving artist
I mean literally starving every night trying to live your dream
I know shit gets hard some times but it's going to be alright
Gotta brush yourself off and keep going
And you ain't just gotta be a rapper I don't care whether you're a singer or actor or actress
Whether you're trying to be in sports
Do what you gotta do, just keep going
It's going to come to you

[Verse 2]
Some of ya'll motherfuckers got the nerve
To sit and talk about what I deserve
When I used to take 26 ? grey-hound ? passing out my shit just to get heard
Yes ya'll Really think this shit is too easy, think about this when you see me:
Before this I burned five thousand CDs by myself with one PC
And maybe that don't mean shit to you but I know what that meant to me
That mentally, I would not stop 'til I got everything that was meant for me
The promoters jerked me I ain't get mad
Put me on first when I shoulda went last
Fuck these niggas, need it to record paying for equipment with money I ain't have
I was in the hood just minding my business
Rappers ain't like me I was too different
It's Fli City ya'll really gotta dodge bullets how bout that cause I gotta dodge this
Guess you could say I was just prepared
Or you could say that I just ain't care
I ain't gotta diss ya'll back, it's the mentality that's gonna keep ya'll there

[Hook]
To my dreamers
There's gonna be people that doubt you and there's gonna be people that try to stop you
I always used to say to myself, "Success is gonna be my revenge"
That's what you gotta do
If somebody hate on you don't feed into it
Hate only begets more hate you feel me?
Just stay focused and on your grind
Don't let nobody tell you what you've been through
You tell them what you've been through
Nas told me that

[Verse 3]
Born premature coulda died right then
Hit by a car could have died when I was ten
Then a car crashed when I was twelve
Car flipped twice thought I saw my end
God coulda took me again and again
We all gonna go but we don't know when
Life is a gift so while I'm here
I won't break and I won't bend
No I ain't the first one in Sunday service
But He know my heart so I ain't nervous
I know that life does have a purpose
And it's about more than what I purchase
We're all working, ain't nobody perfect
End of the day I'm just a person
I found my purpose so I'm gonna serve it
That's why I spread love in all my verses
Logged into Facebook just last night
A young man said he wanted to take his life
Replied to the message right there and on sight
And asked was he cool and was he alright
He said yeah what made him fight
A Jon Connor song that he played that night
So fuck all the money and all the hype
That right there is the reason I write
So, to all you goody two-shoes
With your big words and your new shoes
And your new suits, what do you do?
Besides criticize and that benefits who?
So, instead of just using me
How about really helping the community?
Poverty is the real issue and that right there is way bigger than you and me

[Hook]
And to the people that talk like they're holier than thou
And talk down on people like they do no wrong
Ain't nobody perfect
That includes you you feel me?
Talking down to people never helped nobody
I know this song right here is helping somebody out more than you ever could
What's your motive? I do what I do to help people
Do the right thing because it's the right thing to do
Don't do the right thing because you want somebody to praise you for it later
Cause sometimes the right thing goes without praise
And I accept that. I'm outta here[Verse 1]
This is big dog to a poodle, dead man to a shooter
Nigga, you full of shit, you’re a bedpan in a sewer
Head strong, I manuever like Lex Luger, I’m brutal
I’m from the hood where we make a feast outta ramen noodles
Look, I’m from the bottom where baby mamas the problem
She beefing with baby daddy, she calling a nigga to rob him
Play like she don’t know who shot him, inside she happy they got him
It’s like tomato tomato, wonder if you gon' see tomorrow
This is the motto that most of my people follow
Cause I know a couple cats that ain’t hollows sitting at McDonald's
Look, or have it your way, gourmet, bring it right to you
Sharp minded to the blinded, this the knife to you
Fake niggas is transparent, see right through you
And it’s apparent I’m your parent, I give life to you
Sonning you niggas, some of you dumb niggas
Niggas my age that should be schooling these young niggas
You bum niggas, swallow your tongue, niggas
It ain’t guns, it’s stupid niggas with guns that’s gon' kill us
My shits official, you niggas is wooden nickle
You stick out, we wouldn’t miss ‘em, that mean my shooters won’t miss 'em
You in the wrong hood so ain’t nobody gonna’ miss him
And if I gotta' blame him I gotta blame whoever was with him
You shouldn’t been trying to get him, but instead you was saying ‘'get him’‘
Now one of you niggas gone and the other one facing prison, Lord
And mama like ’‘why my baby had to be involved?’‘
Life is a gamble and the nigga tried to pull his card
Not knowing the other side was strapped like the national guard
Death in his eyes like you can see his reaction to God
Niggas get murdered everyday and we just trying to ball
But this ain’t like the NBA where you taking a charge

[Hook]
I am the untouchable, I am the unbreakable
I am the best in the mother — in the motherfucking world
Best in the motherfucking world
I’m the best in the motherfucking world

[Verse 2]
Nigga, I am the best probably because I never rest
Never thought for a second that I would be second best
I’m the best in the game, go ahead and cut down the net
I got the cheat code like the ref is placing the bet
If you put it on me, tell them niggas time to collect
You bird ass niggas, now I’m bombing your nest
Feel like Tyson bombing your chest, meanwhile I ain’t feeling the pick
When you collide with my my drive feel like you escaped from a wreck
And this is food for thought, don’t know you ate from the rest
But this the state from the chef, make you scrape up the place and invest
From the school of hard knocks niggas bringing right to your desk
I am the study guide so you know your right from left
And what you missed now better get it right on the test
Make sure you’re sure of yourself before you write on the test
I’m from where a second guess with a second left is death
And you could be the exception, but I ain’t holding my breath
Fuck it[Verse 1: Wax]
You watching this, I don’t need your co-sign
Regardless I’ll be chilling up in the hammock in no time
Hawaian coast line, my girl’s so fine
Bikini blow-drying up on the clothes line
No mind on the bovine
I puked up the blue pill we were forced to eat
I’m intolerant to the lactose in the corporate teet
I’m starting not to want to participate or compete
Weren’t we meant to live a life more complete
You know there’s people in Peru right now that are hunter gatherers
And many recent studies have found that they’re happier than we are
I’m to rapping what the Kardashians are to PR
Preface my name with a D-R, huh
But I made a plan to kick the game in its smelly rectum
And I don’t deviate like a healthy septum
I’m the truth and it hurts fools
Yeah go type Wax in ya Youtube search tools
And buy some merch fools

[Verse 2: Rapsody]
Despite Sprite I thrist for mics
Like the look on racists' face if Kanye was Christ
It’s unbelievable, put fear in a poltergeist
He shaking twice, spit something that the Pope won’t like
I’m hoping Mike will understand my ultralight
Like a Sosa night run home to momma, damn she nice
Moonwalking, I’m just a talking and it’s really all light
10% dis or I can give you 90 tonight
Hurting for life, turn ‘em blue like I’m Walter White
Couldn’t face me with Skype, ‘til we cake like Tina and Ike
At your throat boy, fly like Elliott’s bike
Extraterrestrial flow, I’m so outta they sight
In the stars, where Kendrick threw bars, you was abroad
That G5 praying to God, I brought in the squad
And look how I bodied it like Playboy cards
Now they outta control like I said I'm the Queen of New York
It’s rap

[Verse 3: Emis Killa]
Today we are going out baby it’s wow
I bring you to the moon, say hi to the world
You purr and say “miao” and I’ll bring you the Chanel
I take five stars from the sky and I put them in this hotel
Brr, I’m more than cold, I’m Sub-Zero
The sun kisses beautiful people
And I burn like a vampire
Get undressed, enjoy the tropical sea
Which is the end of the world fuck 2012 off
If I would have fistfight and would take a lot
I’ll fall down but the on a red carpet
I’ve got so much swag that if we go around
People don’t know what I see
The panorama or my shoes
I’ve got a watch that shines so much that
I don’t even see what fucking time it is
I treat you as q queen, because I’m a king
If I were Christ, I would wear the gold edition crown of thorns

[Verse 4: Rittz]
I’m getting paid, I finally made it
But haters don’t’ want to see me win
Well I hate the word swag
I hate people that say "my G" and "fam"
I hate "I gotta listen", I’m what Hip Hop is missing
After this one they’ll consider me competition
For the record just because you rapping like you mad
Don't mean you snapping, you just sounding raspy
In Atlanta we don’t ride to that
I bet he get body bagged
I bet he wouldn’t win a boxing match
I’m quick on my feet, I could dodge a jab
You run up, you gunna run out of gas
Cause I'm on top and I'm rhymin'
And choppin' like I was in Karate class
Ya body get sawed in half
You're faker than a knock-off Prada bag, off my launching pad
Dunkin’ on ‘em like I’m Dominique
Reppin’ Strange my chain is stuntin’ on 'em, bada bing!
Off the chain I should probably party with Charlie Sheen
From the South but I wasn’t brought up like Paula Dean
And y’all are lame I’m ‘bout to X y’all out
I write whatever so fuck it if I let Nas down
Yeah, uh-yeah, get my album

[Verse 5: Jon Connor]
Yo the flow is timeless like a diamond
So when I’m rhyming, I’m mining
They said I was stuck in the rough
And you was just lucky to find it
You was foolish as Frankie Lymon
If you decided to try it or fight it
This is Andre the Giant vers' Daniel Bryan
Yes you want it hot, well allow me to change the climate
If the shoe was on the other foot you wouldn’t even know how to tie it
Somebody tell Rita Ora I sort got feelings for her
Got a crib out in Georgia we could raise a son and a daughter
Or we could go out to Florida where the weather is just as gorgeous
Baby I ain’t playing no games like I ran out of quarters
Hold up this is getting outta hand
‘Cause in a year I'mma be saying I’m not her man
Doin’ the U are not the father dance
‘Cause this is Michigan, proof feminine rappers be talking
Ain’t nobody genuine, I be killing it
They can’t touch him, everybody feeling it
But look I cleared out all y’all that got in the way
And y’all knew that I was ill, but now my doctor is Dre
Aftermath, AVM, Flint, Michigan[Hook: Jon Connor]
My big brother is Em's brother, Eazy-E, Yella, and Ren's brother
Who was Ice Cube's brother, who was D.O.C.'s friend
And became my mentor, now let the story begin

[Verse: 1]
Lets start at the "Live from the underground" tour with KRIT
Second leg of the tour they sent me back to Flint
I'm feeling under pressure because it feels like in this business
When you think you're about to make it, they can take it in a second
But much to my surprise it was a blessing in disguise
When life was beating a nigga, I got a DM on Twitter
It was Xzibit like "You wanna go on a run?", I never been to Canada
Sound like this shit could be fun, so every night killing shit just to get my art out
Stage after stage I'm rapping my fuckin' heart out
X game me props because he seen I was good
Said "he would help me if he got in a position he would"
But right after that tour, I was back in the hood
Just grateful for that opportunity, and I understood
That it was back to the grind, dropped Unconscious State
Charting on billboards and I still wasn't signed
My homeboys were losing faith, because they were starting to question
If I was as good as we thought, there ain't no return on their investment
Because we all getting older, whatever that means
Guess that means they feel like too old to be having rap dreams
No where to go, I never felt so low, till I got a unexpected call after a show
It was X he was like "Little homie what you doing?", I said "nothing"
He said "I want to let Dre hear your music"
Ain't think nothing of it or what it could potentially be
Long as you heard my music it was good enough for me
I ain't expect nothing, I got off the phone happy
Next day X said Dre wanna meet you out in Cali
How could a boy from Flint ever dream this day was coming
Fuck butterflies I had Eagles in my stomach
We sitting at Katana and I'm tripping like the whole night
Cause this the moment I've been waiting for my whole life
Hit it off instantly, it was a natural chemistry
Went to your crib, I'm ripping every beat you spit for me, you see my potential
And you see what it could be, can't explain what it meant when you said you understood me
Met so many labels and they just didn't get it
Now the greatest telling me I could be the greatest with him
You made sure my deal was straight, and I got what I deserved, even at your own expense
And in this business that's absurd, giving me advice anytime you see me struggle
You inspire me daily how you keep it so humble
And I want to thank you, not just for giving me my turn, and for helping so many people
And not wanting nothing anything in return

[Hook]Hook: [Jarren Benton]
Woke up and I feel just like a billion (bucks) x3
They gone hate, but we don't give a billion (fucks) x3
I'm in VIP I'm with a billion (sluts) x3
Everyday I feel just like a billion (bucks) x3

[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
Uno, dos, tres, leggo
Y'all sucka ass niggas soft like Jell-O
Pull up in the Trans-Am, nose on the whole gram
Of the white girl nigga, Jay Othello
Kick a nigga door for the k-i-l-o
Blunt full of kush make a nigga feel mellow
Sayonara to the bad guy to the .45 in the SK muthafucka say hello
Hello, hi, me I'm high, mesmerized by neon lights
Bitch you know I'm throwed off, doctor said I'm not right
Got a white bitch but shes not bright
If the bitch'll blow a nigga for his Snickers then imagine
What the ho would do for a Klondike!
Feelin' like a billion
And then I'm about to kill again
He's on his own island bet them niggas think I'm Gilligan
No resilience I'll pop a nigga, drop a nigga Heath Ledger nigga
I'ma pop a little pill again
What up to my homie Ned Fresh up out the pen again
I shove a muthafucka's head right inside the ceiling fan
Leave a pussy nigga shaking in his Timberlands
D-d-d-d stuttering and tr-tr-tr-tr-trembling
Wake up feeling like a billion bucks
Bitch get to steppin' if you don't fuck
I need a ho to give me futuristic head
Blow me in the space ship, call the bitch, Aeon Flux
Fall off in the club with the heat on tuck
This my year y'all be on suck
Gone off that Charlie Sheen that tiger blood bitch we goin' nuts like

[Hook: Jarren Benton]

[Verse 2: Rittz]
Okay Jarren, dog I know they scared
When they see me and you together man it's so unfair
The way we killin' these rappers I bet there's no comparin'
Not a fan of they music I hate the clothes they wearin'
And I'm so embarrassed, at the state of my city
Cause everybody rep they hood in the white boy spot
But when they really in the hood, try and tell 'em where they from
They be lookin' at 'em like, "Boy, stop!"
But not me I'm from the north side, feeling like a billion
I'm a Slumerican, honkey-town affiliate
I'm with a resilient, bitch who let me drill her
Afterwards she call me up and say she never wanna chill again
It's too unsafe, my crew untamed, the shit true
My black friends always rob my white friends
My white friends get drunk and start fighting each other
And when they bloody they be like, "Are we tight man?"
And this red light, damn, and this ain’t sharp rap
Drop that shit on the internet when I see you
I'ma tuck my hair inside of my sock hat, cock back
And swing at your jaw, SMACK, somebody better tell him to fall back
The southern hip-hop's Josh Koscheck, prob'ly got a weapon in the Octagon
I'll stop you while my Jimmy Scotts is on
What you thought, come on, it’s my time man your watch is wrong
I’m gone, I’m on a whole 'nother playing field
My name is still buzzin' the fuckin' streets are watchin'
Rollin' up the Sour Deez in the Cut' Supreme
I could spend this cream in the Neiman Marcus
Lookin' clean, you are steamin' -- heap of garbage
You could scheme, homie I’ma be me regardless
People talk a lot of shit, ‘cause I’m an easy target
Eatin' xani bars, drinkin' Thompson, it got me feelin' like a billion...

[Hook: Jarren Benton]

[Verse 3: Jon Connor]
Flints own, Flintstone, made this buzz on his own
You ain’t on ya grind, but I stay on mine
So what y'all do? Piss, moan
Y'all niggas real fake, my nigga's Bill Gates
Killin' the industry what a difference a year make!
I’m here for your ear sake, you wanna hear great?
You fuck outta luck, I can hear the mirror break
You niggas so basic -- fly
The 'Stairway to Heaven' yo it lead to my basement
Based in the fucking basement it’s amazing
The Matrix that I haze 'em can't save ‘em
Hits give ‘em Canseco on site, I’m a psycho when I write tho like a rifle
Took all of my rivals, I swear that I bless every track (yup)
Hand on the Bible
Backyard, H squad
I came out the hood nigga just like y’all
Love how I stand on my own two feet
But the haters they pray that I just might fall
Nah, never that, I drop classics, nigga, gimme that
See how my name buzz on the internet
If it’s me against the world then I’m winning that
See? Look, my niggas struggle like five in the bank
You bullshittin' like five in the tank
See I, grind for mine, I earn my shine
So I ain’t got another nigga to thank
Moe Cleaves gave me game at a young age
Say niggas only read what's on the front page
And I know that’s true, so he looked me in my eye and say
"Do what you gotta do to make sure that’s you!" Connor...

[Hook: Jarren Benton]Y’all really think I give a fuck ‘bout half the shit y’all say
Been dodging hate since I was 8, I could do this shit all day
Wanna kick my feet up but the lease up so I’m out this bitch
Soon as that day come when everybody around me rich
Selfish intentions, selfish motives attracted by yourself
And when it don’t be you that mean you gotta watch everybody else
But that’s exhausting, I chose the latter, I just don’t fuck with y’all
So consequently, when I be down I don’t know who the fuck to call
Just give me a minute, don’t own the key to success
Yea, I got this from Cosby
But I know the key to failure is when you try to please everybody
I write this shit to keep you personal
So just keep on playing this song until your stress is gone
I’ll be a shrink to your problems, a shrink ‘til they become extinct
My cousin gone, do I lose sleep over haters?
What the fuck you think? Hell nah
I don’t know what to tell y’all
Except that you create your own destiny
And my passion will never fail y’all
Well yo I’d tell livin’ swell y’all
But I’d be lying if I ain’t sayin’ I went through hell y’all
My tails of fighting demons in brimstone compels all
But I tell the ugly truth about the hood and hopes that it repels y’all
I hope that y’all don’t get the wrong impression of me
I swear I’m trying to use discretion with this aggression homie
What do people want to know my music is to truly know me
My middle finger is reserved for the fake and phony
It is what it is and as long as I’m my mama’s son
I’mma chase my dreams so you
Ain’t gotta count down how long I run
Shit, the eternal yard dash in the finish line
It’s in his mind and I know winning is not far away
But the beginning is trying harder bullshit in this rap game, fuck it
I’mma eat that just as long as
I give that real shit to all my people who need that
And fuck yea I’mma lash out
Without a go never back out
As hard as y’all know that I’mma shine
I guess I just had to blackout, Blackout[Intro]
(I am the best in the world at what I do)
Yeah!
AVM
Aftermath
Y'all know what time it is, let's go

[Verse 1]
It's the return of the genius
Ego probably as big as my penis
Yo girl probably seen it
These rappers is wack and sound like they can barely speak english
These niggas sound stupid and you just consume it
Confusing with music, the fuck is you doing?
Y'all sound like duh duh duh duh duh
If it wasn't the truth then it might be amusing, look
They say I'm the voice of the people
That mean that I speaking no evil
They tell me that life is a bitch
Well I'm cool with the shit as long as she deep throat
Don't follow the leader, just go be a leader
Some people ain't think cos they eat what you feed em
Accept how you treat 'em
Cause they too scared to rock the boat, damn I miss Aaliyah
Linin' up to see Connor get busy
I just want y'all to feel me, just want y'all to feel how I felt when I used to be listenin' to biggie or 2Pac or Timbaland, Missy or Weezy
A mixtape from 50, well fuck it
DMX with some production from Swizzy
Shit was authentic
Go figure cause niggas was rich but they spit like they ain't have a penny

[Hook]
I miss the basement, rap city
I miss big lips and big titties
I miss big lips and big titties
Rap fucking sucks, see the hickies?
Ananda Lewis, I thought she was pretty
She 40, I fuck her, she feel like she 60
And that's of a quickie cause shit I ain't picky
Wait we ain't get too far of the subject did we?

[Interlude]
(I am the best in the world at what I do
I am the best in the world at what I do
Best in the world)

[Verse 2]
Best in the world, yeah that's me, definitely destiny
Destined to progress I'm the chef peep the recipe
How can I see? Top of the heat balling I'm dreaming
'Bout knock on the door lock on the door
How y'all gon keep me out?
I keep it 150 nobody fucking with me
Go in 'til the 'mo empty, spit like I'm still Indie
Rise to the occasion, recognize my location
Jeopardize, nigga don't try I am not for the fake shit
I am not finna go basic, have my talents wasted
I came outta my basement with a dream I'm gon chase it

[Outro]
Man that's it man..(hah)
(Best in the world)[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
On a bathroom wall I wrote
"I'd rather argue with you than be with someone else"
I took a piss and dismiss it like "fuck it"
And I went and found somebody else
Fuck arguing and harvesting the feelings
Yo, I'd rather be by my fucking self
Till about two a.m. and I call back
And I hang up and I start to blame myself
Somebody help...
You used to cry cause both your parents was addicts and your sister was ratchet
So I made it my mission to get you up out of that shit
Probably my fault for trying to be a hero when I can't be
Or your fault for sending me DM's that said "Save me"
Shit I was trying, I know that we been had some ups and downs
At Xzibit house, found out you and some nigga fucking now
Lied and said you told him about us and that he don't mess with you
Well if ya'll ain't fucking, why the fuck this nigga texting you
While you was sleeping I'd go and pick up your phone
And said "babe is you okay? And let me know when you coming home"
So I put you on a plane like I'm done with you
I fly back to Flint and I'm back in the back of the whip choking and fucking you
I know you ain't getting this type of dick from that local dude
You was running game on me like this nigga was coaching you
I'm fucking girls over while you was fucking some other dude
In the beginning saw something in you, but that just wasn't you
Love no cost a thing, and that's why I wouldn't cheat
Western Union every week so you and your daughters could eat
Western Union every week so you and your kids could sleep
On a bed while your sister would throw you out on the street
Thought if I showed you California and the shit that I was doing with the music
You would stop being so motherfucking stupid
I wouldn't try to buy you, I tried to be by you
Wanted you and the girls to have a fucking better life too
Came home for Christmas, I think it was on a Friday
Drive to your crib, homies’ car was already in the driveway
I walked to the door, my future flashed before my eyes
I'm finally signed and I'm about to give it up over pride
See I just left Hawaii and now I'm standing in the hood arguing with a nigger over a bitch I was calling wifey
This nigga stood in front of you and said you was his side bitch, you still behind that nigga he looking at me like that's my bitch
Wanted to spazz, but we in somebody else's home
She kept telling me to leave cause she was already gone
1000 dollars in an envelope you can have it
I made sure you had it, even if I ain't had shit
Always said "Jon we're living too different lives"
Ain't know that's an excuse for you fucking two different guys
Outer beauty never hides the ugliness that's inside
Memories haunt my mind, but all I know is that I tried
Told you I'd leave you alone if you was really in love with him
We could never work cause you ain't never stop fucking him
It all was a lie, regardless of how I felt
Now I see you for who you are, can't do nothing but blame myself
For Real..[Hook]
Bound to fall in love
Bound to fall in love
(Uh-huh, honey)

[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
You fuck a nigga I fuck a bitch, do that make us even?
We not together so all in all does that make it cheatin'?
Buying flights every week like a nigga rich
Thousand dollars for a flight to fuck another nigga bitch
Good pussy got a nigga on some nigga shit
But, at least a nigga nigga rich
Late nights driving by your crib like okay
Bitch got me sitting in the whip like OJ
Bitch got me sitting in the whip like OJ
Thinking if I make the news the fuck Dre gon' say?
Tattoos on our fingers on some love shit
Tattoos on our fingers on some dumb shit
I can't believe this bitch was so see-through
Met the other nigga and he turned me into Mr Me Too
Said "I know how to make her squirt", I was like "Me too"
He used to drop her off at work, I was like "Me too"
I picked the kids up from school, he was like "Me too"
Said she was pregnant, shit that could've been my seed too
The same shit that make you cry, it kinda make you laugh
I hurt so many good girls fucking with your crazy ass
Bound

[Hook (Connor Talking)]
(I know when I'm fucked up
I know, nigga I know when I'm fucked up
Ya'll niggas be fronting, nigga I ain't
Shit nigga, you know what I'm saying?
It's real right?)

[Verse 2: Jon Connor]
Feeling like I'm stuck with you
I keep saying I'm done with you
My friends say they can't fuck with me, if I choose to fuck with you
They don't want to stick around to see Titanic sink
I mean damn, what would Jeromey Romey Romey Rome think?
Both of us have made mistakes, ain't been the same ever since
Now we stalking Facebook, Twitter, Instagram for evidence
Ask me do I love her, then the answer gon' be fucking yes
It's a vicious circle, how I get out of this fucking mess
Conflicting stories, my life is Maury on a daily basis
Say I ain't gon' fuck this bitch again-- Then she get naked
Everybody drained from our shit, it ain't no one to tell
Your friends and my friends both saying we dumb as hell
We both grown as fuck but we acting young as hell
Damn near fist fighting, ain't happy 'til either one in jail
Bound

[Hook] (Connor Talking)]
(Know what I'm talking about?
Man this shit outta control my nigga look
Check it out)

[Verse 3: Jon Connor]
Yo' mama hate me, sister hate me, the fuck I'mma do?
My mama hate you and my sister fucking hate you too
You act confused when we be talking like "Why ain't we cool?"
I'm like "Think really really hard bitch, what ain't you do?"
Got a baby daddy and this side nigga
And what makes it worse is he be hanging out with my niggas
So they tell me when you doing dirt
When you think I ain't alert
We both be cheating now it's a matter of who gon' do it first
Lord, it make me wonder why I like yo' ass
Either I'm in love or I'm a motherfucking psychopath
Shit's sad, we both be on some bullshit
Both be tryna pull shit
Off but we get caught by folks that both of us is cool with
My hood niggas be like "Damn she did my nigga wrong"
My hood niggas be like "Damn she got my nigga gone
Got my nigga calling 'round town, this nigga making songs
Never seen him like this, what the fuck my nigga on?"
Bound

[Hook (Connor Talking)]
(Be alright though, know what I'm saying?
Ain't the first time, won't be the last
Be the last time it happens like this though)

[Bridge: Jon Connor]
Close your eyes and let the word paint a thousand pictures
One good girl is worth a thousand bitches
