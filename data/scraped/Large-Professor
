[Verse 1]
It ain't hard to tell, I excel then prevail
The mic is contacted, I attract clientele
My mic check is life or death, breathing a sniper's breath
I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
Deep like the Shining, sparkle like a diamond
Sneak a Uzi on the island in my army jacket lining
Hit the Earth like a comet – invasion!
Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian, half-man, half-amazing
Cause in my physical, I can express through song
Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong
I drink Moet with Medusa, give her shotguns in hell
From the spliff that I lift and inhale, it ain't hard to tell

[Verse 2]
The buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up
Not stories by Aesop, place your loot up, parties I shoot up
Nas, I analyze, drop a jewel, inhale from the L
School a fool well, you feel it like Braille, it ain't hard to tell
I kick a skill like Shaquille holds a pill
Vocabulary spills I'm Ill plus Matic
I freak beats, slam it like Iron Sheik
Jam like a Tec with correct techniques
So analyze me, surprise me, but can't magmatize me
Scannin' while you're plannin' ways to sabotage me
I leave 'em froze like her-on in your nose
Nas'll rock well, it ain't hard to tell

[Verse 3]
This rhythmatic explosion is what your frame of mind has chosen
I'll leave your brain stimulated, niggas is frozen
Speak with criminal slang, begin like a violin
End like Leviathan, it's deep, well let me try again
Wisdom be leaking out my grapefruit, troop
I dominate break loops, giving mics men-e-strual cycles
Street's disciple, I rock beats that's mega trifle
And groove even smoother than moves by Villanova
You're still a soldier, I'm like Sly Stone in Cobra
Packing like a Rasta in the weed spot, vocals'll squeeze Glocks
MC's eavesdrop though they need not to sneak
My poetry's deep, I never fail
Nas' raps should be locked in a cell, it ain't hard to tell[Produced by Large Professor]

[Intro]
Check me out y'all
Nasty Nas in your area
About to cause mass hysteria

[Verse 1]
Before I blunt, I take out my fronts
Then I start to front; matter of fact, I be on a manhunt
You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
That's like Malcolm X catching the Jungle Fever
King poetic. Too much flavor, I'm major
Atlanta ain't Brave-r, I'll pull a number like a pager
Cause I'm an ace when I face the bass
40-side is the place that is giving me grace
Now wait, another dose and you might be dead
And I'm a Nike-head, I wear chains that excite the Feds
And ain't a damn thing gonna change
I'mma performer strange, so the mic warmer was born to gain
Nas, why did you do it
You know you got the mad fat fluid when you rhyme, it's halftime

[Hook]
It's halftime
This is how it feel, check it out, how it feel

[Verse 2]
It's like that, you know it's like that
I got it hemmed, now you never get the mic back
When I attack, there ain't an army that could strike back
So I react never calmly on a hype track
I set it off with my own rhyme
Cause I'm as ill as a convict who kills for phone time
I'm max like cassettes, I flex like sex
In your stereo sets, Nas'll catch wreck
I used to hustle; now all I do is relax and strive
When I was young I was a fan of the Jackson 5
I drop jewels, wear jewels, hope to never run it
With more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach
Nasty Nas has to rise cause I'm wise
This is exercise 'til the microphone dies
Back in '83 I was an MC sparkin'
But I was too scared to grab the mics in the parks and
Kick my little raps cause I thought niggas wouldn't understand
And now in every jam I'm the fuckin' man
I rap in front of more niggas than in the slave ships
I used to watch "CHiPs", now I load Glock clips
I got to have it, I miss Mr. Magic
Versatile, my style switches like a faggot
But not bisexual, I'm an intellectual
Of rap I'm a professional and that's no question, yo
These are the lyrics of the man, you can't near it, understand?
Cause in the streets, I'm well-known like the number man
Am I in place with the bass and format
Explore rap and tell me "Nas ain't all that"
And next time I rhyme, I be foul
Whenever I freestyle I see trial, niggas say I'm wild
I hate a rhyme-biter's rhyme
Stay tuned, Nas soon - the real rap comes at halftime

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I got it going on, even flip a morning song
Every afternoon, I kick half the tune
And in the darkness, I'm heartless like when the NARC's hit
Word to Marcus Garvey: I hardly sparked it
Cause when I blast the herb, that's my word
I be slayin' them fast, doing this that and the third
But chill, pass the Andre, and let's slay
I bag bitches up at John Jay, and hit a matinee
Putting hits on 5-0
Cause when it's my time to go, I wait for God with the .44
And biters can't come near
And yo, go to hell to the foul cop who shot Garcia
I won't plant seeds, don't need an extra mouth I can't feed
That's extra Phillie change, more cash for damp weed
This goes out to Manhattan, the island of Staten
Brooklyn and Queens is living fat and
The Boogie Down, enough props, enough clout
Ill Will, rest in peace, yo, I'm out[Produced by Large Professor]

[Intro - Nas + [Grand Wizard]

[Hook]
(Grand Wizard) One time for your mind, one time
(Nas) Yeah, whatever
(GW) One time for your mind, one time
(Nas) Yo, whatever
(GW) One time for your mind, one time
Hey yo, Nas? Kick that fuckin' rhyme

[Verse 1]
Check it out
When I'm chilling, I grab the buddha, get my crew to buy beers
And watch a flick, illin' and root for the villain, huh
Plus every morning, I go out and love it sort of chilly
Then I send a shorty from my block to the store for Phillies
After being blessed by the herb's essence
I'm back to my rest, ten minutes, some odd seconds
That's where I got the honey at, spends the night for sexing
Keep lubrication, Lifestyle protection
Htting up my stereo's remote control quickly
Ron G's in the cassette deck, rocking the shit, G
I try to stay mellow, rock, well acappella rhymes'll
Make me richer than a slipper made Cinderella, fella
Go get your crew, Hobbes, I'm prepared to bomb troops
Y'all niggas was born, I shot my way out my mom dukes
When I was ten I was a hip-hoppin' shorty wop
Known for rocking microphones and twisting off a 40 top, yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Right, right, what up niggas, how y'all? It's Nasty, the villain
I'm still writing rhymes, but besides that I'm chillin'
I'm trying to get this money, God, you know the hard times, kid
Shit, cold be starving make you wanna do crimes kid
But I'mma lamp, cause a crime couldn't beat a rhyme
Niggas catching 3 to 9's, Muslims yelling "Free the mind"
And I'm from Queensbridge, been to many places
As a kid when I would say that out of town, niggas chased us
But now I know the time, got a older mind
Plus control a nine, fine, see now I represent mine
I'm new on the rap scene, brothers never heard of me
Yet I'm a menace, yo, police wanna murder me
Heini Dark drinker, represent the thinker
My pen rides the paper, it even has blinkers
Think I'll dim the lights then inhale, it stimulates
Floating like I'm on the North 95 Interstate
Never plan to stop, when I write my hand is hot
And expand a lot from the Wiz to Camelot
The parlayer, I'll make ya heads bop, pa
I shine a light on perpetrators like a cop's car
From day to night, I play the mic and you'll thank God
I wreck shit so much, the microphone'll need a paint job
My brain is incarcerated
Live at any jam, I couldn't count all the parks I raided
I hold a Mac-11, and attack a reverend
I contact 11 L's and max in heaven

[Hook]

[Outro]
[Nas] Yo, from ninety-two to ninety-nine
[LP] Yeah that shit was crazy fat Paul, kno what I’m sayin?
But check it, you gotta another verse for me
I want you to kick it, you know what I'msayin?
Kick that shit for the projects[Produced by Large Professor]

[Hook]
It's like that y'all (that y'all!), that y'all (that y'all!)
That y'all (that y'all!), that y'all (that y'all!)
That y'all (that y'all!), that y'all (that y'all!)
And that's all!

[Nas]
Street's disciple, my raps are trifle
I shoot slugs from my brain just like a rifle
Stampede the stage, I leave the microphone split
Play Mr Tuffy while I'm on some Pretty Tone shit
Verbal assassin, my architect pleases
When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffing Jesus
Nasty Nas is a rebel to America
Police murderer, I'm causing hysteria
My troops roll up with a strange force
I was trapped in a cage and let out by the Main Source
Swimming in women like a lifeguard
Put on a bulletproof nigga I strike hard
Kidnap the President's wife without a plan
And hanging niggas like the Ku Klux Klan
I melt mics till the sound wave's over
Before stepping to me you'd rather step to Jehovah
Slamming MC's on cement
Cause verbally, I'm iller than a AIDS patient
I move swift and uplift your mind
Shoot the gift when I riff in rhyme
Rapping sniper, speaking real words
My thoughts react, like Steven Spielberg's
Poetry attacks, paragraphs punch hard
My brain is insane, I'm out to lunch, God
Science is dropped, my raps are toxic
My voicebox locks and excels like a rocket

[Hook]

[Joe Fatal]
Fatal is merciful and they curse me
When I grip the mic I show no mercy
I got heart, I rip the party apart
From the seams and hem up like bell-bottom jeans
But you get done, you get blues like 501
Brothers are live but I bet ya I'm liver son
So let me get upon the scene and redeem
The dream of a team, and knock 'em out like Mitch Green
Smoke some thai weed, flow at a high speed
Rap on off breaks stomping like Northlakes
Cause I'm living larger than the founders of Fendi
An Asiatic brother that many rappers envy
So round up your crew and entourage
And let the God Merciful just take charge

[Hook]

[Akinyele]
Some of them said (said what?) that the Ak should quit
But I don't sweat it, cause I'm too big for that small shit
Like pigs when it comes to a showdown
Huff and puff but the Ak won't get blown down
Cause I come strong, rather than come at all and not be ready
That's what separates me from the petty
MC's gas themselves by drinking too much Getty
And get torn the fuck up like confetti
I'm rich and thick in lyrics like Aunt Jemima
It doesn't take Keenan Ivory Wayans to know that I'mma
Get you sucker if you bite like a piranha
So save them preschool rhymes for the kids at Wonderama
Point blank, period, with no comma
Rhymes so dangerous, call for the homicide
Cause I knock 'em dead even when I'm at my worst
The only future that lies ahead of them is the lights from the hearse
Got game like a crackhead
But don't be misled, I keep rappers on lock like a dread
Knots in the head from the words that I said
So get a shovel and dig your grave cause the shit you talk is dead

[Hook]

[Large Professor]
I grab up girls like jacks
Add 'em on like tax, and I'm over like Hot Trax
As far as brothers are concerned a pressure cooker from start
To finish I diminish like a Cuisinart
Secondly, I'm sick of critics, who's necking me
(Oooh he got an afro) yo, but I got dough
Why's my name the Large Professor?
Cause I milked your cow in other words I hit your heifer
Don't talk about how you can break Rambo
That's just a bunch of mamba-ja-hambo
Propaganda, save it for Savanda
Joe and Amanda, Zach and Alexandra
Don't let the folks around your way puff your head
Cause you'll be the owner of a hospital bed
I'll kick fire out your ass so fast
You'll be as crispy as my man Bill Blass

[Hook x4][Verse 1]
Listen up gangstas and honeys with your hair done
Pull up a chair hon', and put it in the air son
Dog whatever they call you, God just listen
I spit a story backwards, it starts at the ending
The bullet goes back in the gun
The bullet hole's closing this chest of a nigga
Now he back to square one
Screaming, "shoot don't please"
I put my fifth back on my hip
It's like a VCR rewinding a hit
He put his hands back on his bitch
My caravan doors open up
I jumped back in the van and closed it shut
Going reverse, slowly prepared
My nigga Jungle utters out something crazy like, "go he there"
Sitting in back of this chair, we hitting the roach
The smoke goes back in the blunt, the blunt gets bigger in growth
Jungle unrolls it, put his weed back in the jar
The blunt turns back into a cigar
We listen to Stevie, it sounded like heavy metal fans
Spinning records backwards of AC/DC
I give my niggas dap, jump out the van back first
Back upstairs, took off the black shirt
I'm in the crib with the phone to my ear
Listen up so y'all can figure out the poem real clear
The voice on the phone was like, "outside right we"
So with my mouth wide, holding my heat
Bullets I had plenty to squeeze, plenty for you
Cause Jungle said, "block your on enemy's the"
Hung up the phone, then the phone rang
I'm laid in the bed thinkin bout this pretty young thing
Who left, she came back, her clothes just fell to the rug
She fell to my bed and gave me a hug
I told her, "no hell"
She talking bout, "me kiss"
Bobbed her head then spit the nut back in my dick
Started sucking with no hands, a whole lotta spit
Then got up and put her bra back on her tits
Got fully dressed and told me, "stressed really I'm"
Picked up her Gucci bag and left a nigga behind
Walking through the door, she rang the bell twice
I vomited vodka back in my glass with juice and ice
The clock went back from three, to two, to one
And that's about the time the story begun
That's when I first heard the voicemail on the cell
It said, "son we found that nigga we gotta kill"
Ay yo son, ay yo son, you hear me, you hear me
Listen man, this dude right on the block, right now, man
I found him, right now, I see him right now
Let's kill him
"Yo, this Nas, leave it; peace"[Produced by Large Professor]

[Verse 1]
They plan was to knock me out the top of the game
But I overstand they truth is all lame
I hold cannons that shoot balls of flames
Right in they fat mouth then I carve my name
Nas – too real, Nas – true king
It's however you feel, go 'head, you swing
Your arms too short to box with God
I don't kill soloists, only kill squads
Fame went to they head, so now it's "Fuck Nas"
Yesterday you begged for a deal, today you tough guys
I seen it coming, soon as I popped my first bottle
I spotted my enemies tryna do what I do
Came in with my style, so I fathered you
I kept changing on the world since "Barbeque"
Now you wanna hang with niggas I hung with
Fuck bitches I hit, it's funny I once said
If I, ever make a record, I take a check
And put something away for a rainy day to make my exit
But look at me now, ten years deep
Since the project bench with crack in my sock, asleep
I never asked to be top of rap's elite
Just a ghetto child tryna learn the traps of the streets
But look at me now

[Hook]
"You're the man"

[Verse 2]
Now wait a sec, give me time to explain, women and fast cars
And diamond rings can poison a rap star
It's suicidal, how I smoke in so much la
I saw a dead bird flying through a broken sky
Wish I could flap wings and fly away
To where black kings in Ghana stay, so I could get old
My flesh rot away but that'll be the day when it's peace
When my gat don't need to spray when these streets are safe to play
Sex with death, indulge in these women
Envision my own skeleton swimming in eternal fire
Broads play with pentagrams in they vagina
Like the Exorcist, then they gave birth to my seeds
I beg for God's help, why they love hurting me?
I'm your disciple, a thug certainly
I'm the N, the A to the S-I-R
If I wasn't I must've been Escobar
45 in my waist, staring at my reflection in the mirror
Sitting still in the chair like Mike Concepcion
When everything around me got cloudy
The chair became a king's throne, my destiny found me
It was clear why the struggle was so painful
Metamorphosis, this is what I changed to, and God, I'm so thankful

[Hook][Produced by No I.D.]

[Intro]
42nd street terminal

[Verse 1]
Yo, yo, I live it and I speak it
My religion is reefer
Big money and the most
Uninhibited freak to sleep with
My visions are realistic
Nothing is figurative
I can wish it into existence
God want this nigga to live
Blunt big as a dread
I get high and forget who bled
Who we stomp-kicked in the head and who we left for dead
Who are you niggas
Why argue niggas
The truth is the truth
I really put my scars on niggas
They wear them lifetime, they tell they hoes, Nas did this
Pointing to they scars like
Right here, baby, really Nas did this
Like a badge of honor, not bragging I'm just honest
War stories we tell them, nothing's realer than karma
Sip prohibition liquor, prohibition whiskey
Rap Jack Dempsey, matte black Bentley, pimply
Shatterin' your silence, passing round the chalice
Due to my Indian ancestry at the weed dispensery
Official kings and gents is who I mix and mingle with
Fuck your ice
I rock rubies, amethyst
I'll fuck your wife cause she a groupie, scandalous
This for my bad hood bitches, ghetto glamorous

[Break: Large Professor]
Yo, what we talking bout niggas
What we talking bout niggas
This is Nas, what, Nas
What, Nasty, what recollect fucker

[Verse 2: Nas]
At seventeen I made seventeen thousand living in public housing
Integrity intact, repping hard
They asking how he disappear and reappear back on top
Saying Nas must have naked pictures of God or something
To keep winning is my way like Francis
As long as I'm breathing, I'll take chances
A soldier comin' home, twenty years old with no legs
Sayin' there's no sense to cry and complain, just go head
So much to write and say, yo I don't know where to start
So I'll begin with the basics and flow from the heart
I know you think my life is good cause my diamond piece
But my life been good since I started finding peace
I shouldn't even be smiling, I should be angry and depressed
I been rich longer than I been broke, I confess
I started out broke, got rich, lost paper then made it back
Like Trump being up down up, play with cash

[Break: Large Professor]
My nigga's like a locomotive
Nas, we push it, mush 'em
Queensbridge to Bushwick
Harlem
Bronx
All that
You ain't even supposed to be here
You know where you at

[Verse 3]
At night, New York, eat a slice too hot
Use my tongue to tear the skin hanging from the roof of my mouth
Shit was felicissimo melting pot, city sweltering hot
Staggering, drunker than those cops that 2Pac shot
I was a crook by the train with that iron thing, concealed
Reaching, soon as I heard them iron wheels screeching
When it came to a halt whoever walked off got caught
Token man safe behind a locked door for sure
Minor thief shit, minor league shit, beasting
Looking for the juks young, but now we older chiefing
In my truck, play The Greatest Adventures of Slick Rick
Bugging on how his imagination was so sick
It's ghetto beef, sinister niggas snicker through yellow teeth
Alcohol aging my niggas faster than felonies
How dare I
Must be, something in the air that corrupts me
Look at my upkeep, owned and sublease
I'm here y'all

[Outro]
This for my trapped in the 90s niggas
For my trapped in the 90s niggas
Ha for y'all niggasVerse 1:
I write lyrics that'll seduce Medusa
Produce world insanity, change the human future Pick up the pen without touching it physically
And then leak body fluids, pardon my speech Now granted, I'm every murder that happened on the planet
Running rampant, I'm making this money to take advantage  I rap just like laying in the ghetto on a hammock
My metaphors are causing panic, my eyes slanted  I just booked a Chinese chick that looks Spanish
And me getting head in the car is so romantic Top seat Indian chief that's bout his brief case
Cash Flows selling out shows over eBay  Press play at ya own risk
Watch the game evolve backwards, swallowed by my own gift Without a gun I could still shoot the breeze
Every sentence is another disease… 90

Hook (x2):
This a time when the rap was so classic
Turn a rap fan into addicts
The style created was so captive
The flow and the beats were like magic

Verse 2:
Verbal safari in the jungles of illuminati
I treat the rhythm like it's origami, or… I treat the rhythm like some strippers at a party
I'm smoother than a foreign coffee, bitch get off me Lavish in a lavender Benz, this flow is endless
Body music, so I plead the 5th amendment  Me, I love the ghetto, but I rhyme with its resentment
Free as a sentence, smoking weed at the entrance Black power in the thoughts of Eisenhower
Or a plane through the eiffel tower, I'm living cocaine  I'm that ni**a in the 80's wit a rope chain
Die righteous, but living in the dope game Six cylinder life is all sinister
Stab with a prisoner's knife solo enigma  The best lyricist has now entered
I'm the real around a bunch of pretenders... 90

Hook (x2):
This a time when the rap was so classic
Turn a rap fan into addicts
The style created was so captive
The flow and the beats were like magic

Verse 3:
It is what it is, is life's license, smoking to fight titans
I'm better off fighting a Mike Tyson I live what I'm writing, I'm caught between a bullet and a Heineken
Illa the Einstein, raps nitrogen Cash out before the Grim Reaper cashes in
Life's a bitch, or better yet a Kardashian Each verse is a place where the past begins
Spoken acid, wrote it in its natural sin Each rap beyond mars, spit a car jacking
This is diction, friction, a new addiction Steps ahead, got it made like I'm Special Ed
Or Dapper Dan, super hero rapper man Wrap 'em up like a boxers hand
Box cutter, the Illa pops off like a rubber band Bottom line, I'm the man
I'm making it do what it do, do what I can

Hook (x2):
This a time when the rap was so classic
Turn a rap fan into addicts
The style created was so captive
The flow and the beats were like magic(Hook x2)
My brain's strange from taking contaminated acid
While you be selling your soul we assassinate assassins
Am I hallucinating?
You'll see visions of death, possessed
By homicide is what I'm obsessed

Reek of puterfaction and drugs, the acid taste often lingers
Susan Atkins licked the blood of Sharon Tate off her fingers
Off the hand of Satan, hot corpse masturbation
Get my rocks off, sparking a golf course assassination
Pistol whip and kill the rich, triple six
Extremely horrible like a beautiful bitch with a dick
Every society receives the criminals it deserves
Subliminal with the words, and every visual's absurd
Dope dealer storm dancers rain down chronic showers
The cult leader cure cancer with hypnotic powers
Goon druggie tie-dyed psychedelic paint job
Dune-buggy drive-bys, heretics that hate God
Red spider acid tongue, death rider, bastard son
Empire stand as one, Hellfire Canyon Club
Crocodile confessions occupy obsessions
We personify homicide - We're the essence

(Hook x2)

"Death To Pigs" written on the wall in blood
Pestilence and sickness the war's begun
Trippin' in a coffin numb
Lift your tongue, put this underneath
Orange Sunshine, a hundred sheets
Morbid dungeons and demons a hundred deep
Grimy tornado tyrants and independent souls
Hawaii volcano, private Jimi Hendrix shows
I’ve seen the symmetry of infinity clearly, like Timothy Leary weary
Questioning every existing theory
Then we enter to the hallways of the always
Twisted like corn-braids
Trippin' like Grateful Dead tour-dates
I seen Satan and God raping your mom
Then they all melted away in globs and claymation blobs
Simulation, Play Station, X-Box the death doctrine
Altamount angels to murder-sprees with Tex Watson
The shepard sent the lamb to Bethlehem
Pentagon Nephilim, sitting in the center of a pentagram

(Hook x2)[Verse 1]
Here comes the hurricane, C.L. same name
Cut by the grain when I land upon the plain
Jah knew the Hebrew, a Papa Duke need you
But none of the fam who saw had a clue
Escalate the prime rate, words coagulate
Generate the mind's state, never can deflate
Nigger, you jigaboo, it doesn't have to be you
Funny like a cartoon, Pepe Le Pew
Pimp are the lyrical, g-string the individual
But the metaphysical isn't spriritual
Straight from the heart I frame the art
Tune up my class, real fast, very smart
Dictate the technique, wait a minute, I speak
Loved by my son and a kiss on the cheek
Stutter-step the concept, blueprint, or pro
Steady as we go so act like you know

[Verse 2]
I stand by the rabbi, sail in Shanghai
Always had an alibi even if I lie
Crucial, never neutral, bare the fruitful
Past time, another rhyme, skedaddle, Yankee Doodle
Light skin in lovely gyp, just for the honey dip
Here to make a megahit fit
Don't install the pipe dream, renaissance regime
When you run ragged I pick up the steam
Chart on the record book, what Corey Love took the hook
Here's a new book to civilize a crook
Purest of the pedigree, feed 'em a line
C.L., no Jezebel, can never sleep well
Thick like a dred, at the Club Med
The Mecca Don said, a fish out of water is dead
Pete Rock, the soul brother, cruise on a flow
Swing low and yell "Geronimo!", act like you know

[Verse 3]
C.L. can play like Nike, come on just do it
Pacify the Gemini, soul into it
Beat to my feet is a lock like concrete
Hard for the street, decipher never incomplete
A clean editorial, rather historical
Affordable, recordable, nifty like a portable
Mecca is the syndrome, when I come back home
Boogie on a baritone, listen on a phone
Libra, the achiever, toke a reefer
C.L. the girl pleaser, like Ebanezer
So here is the good sign, I incline
Titties with the bitties when I wine and dine
Worn like corduroy, comes the bad boy
But just like Anita Pita, I bring ya joy
"Agoobilonians" with your knowledge
And take as said so, flow and act like you know(Sadat X)
When you say the name X, think synonymous wit fame
Only draw love off the mention of my name
I got a rhyme or two left then I'm a blend to the side
Go out on top like Jim Brown at his peak, I get wreck like ery week
Get my freak on, who dares to speak on
My armed forces recon, penatrating like decon
Guerilla tactics, stage theatrics
She's laying on the mattress
I'm hiking up the black dress
Finesse called on me to bless
I pulled the S off my varsity sweater, fine tuned to the letter
So let's make these stacks and max, relax, be waxed
The tracks receive faxs wit my picture, in a cowboy hat
Now top that, yo, kid, top that
Kid got blown away at exactly where you're sitting
Just the other day but nobody's admitting
To the crime, I'm a MC not a MD
The best in history or maybe one of the top 3
Says myself, no diggedy

(Large Professor)
I be synonymous to king, fling niggas to the mat
Like an acrobat, flipping the mental ass whipping
Is served when I un-nerved another wack Jack imposter
Trying to fraud, you gots to get the fuk down wit the Lord
Finesse, whether you think you're pimp status or the best
Mad crazy or stupid, find a hot beat and loop it
For what it's worth, I've been a hip-hopper from birth
Try to disrespect and get your ass played up like a smurf
I'm running over the track, type of nigga to stack
One million, hit my moms, then fuk it, make a trillion
To start, showing the world who's the man wit the heart
That's about to blast off on these kids that's mad soft
Don't fuk wit Large Professor or you get your ass mauled
So ah, say no more, them niggas that supports
Large Profess, Lord Finesse and Dat X for the tour
Grand Puba, who's probably coming back from Aruba
Wit the skill to build, I'm saying peace, you niggas, chill

(Grand Puba)
Dig it, I be that nigga wit the creamy ass rhyme flow
My shit's so hot, I'll burn the ass of an Eskimo
I'm saying though, it be the Grand flipping flam
Giving love to my fans and you know this man
My composition leaves competition wishing
They could be in my postition cuz I did it wit no ass kissing
I'll be there like Michael Jackson and you don't stop
Until you get enuff and I'll be damn if my nose drop
I speak Actual facts on how I feel
Don't worry baby, wit Puba, there's no waiting just to exhale
I bag dimes like Jada, step through playa haters
Keep niggas moving like a fuking escalator
Because it's poetry in motion
Pube keep it smooth like lotion, keeping MC's lost like Billy Ocean
Dig what I'm saying I be a buck 85 on the weigh-in

(Lord Finesse)
It goes dip dip diving, check who you sizing
It's the wize civilizing, pockets stll rising
When I drop it, I'm futuristic like Fiber Optic
Didn't buy my album, you played yourself, should of copped it
Nuthin could beat my elite rhymes throwing your hands kid
That better be a peace sign
You don't want it, that's my steelo, how we on it
When we do our thing, niggas spread the word like informants
But still advancing, skills enhancing
We got up on a shooken offbeat like white people dancing
We're too bugged, true thugs
Quick to get in that ass in ways that homo's wouldn't approve of
I'm not yapping, just rapping
Don't care if you're gold or platinum, don't think it can't happen
Whether wit a beat or acapella, it's the mic Rockafella
Strictly out for the mozarella
Fuk guns and toolies, we don't betray movies
It's yours truely that's smoothly, still sounds groovy
You can't do me or dis me, don't try to get wit me
My style is tricky like spelling Mississippi
Strictly, come and get me, if you can flip me
If this flow was whisley, I have you muthafukas tipsy
The ghetto type playas that caters
Famous to you spectators, the rhyme sayers, catch you later[Cormega]

Under the sun vultures looming
Hoping to consume a culture wounded
Boldly refusing to die show and proving
I embodied what only few can
Wearing sincerity not the robe of Judas
My golden rule is live no lie
I know truth is part of my focus
Music art imitates life growth included
I'm bound by word hold me to it
My heart and nerve are accountable no excuses
I never made a deal with my soul included
I know what's real and I know illusions
Misery loves company I chose seclusion
There's degrees to separation
I know my true friends and forced alliances
Conspiring the denial of hearing my aspiring rhyming is timeless and genuine
That's where my mind is at: a reflective state
I weigh my mans like grams
Understanding there are losses when you measure weight[Verse 1: Large Professor]
Astonishing how I flip a mic and start bombin’ shit
Varnishing, paint on the wall with knowledge and
Wisdom, one, two, dip ‘em in the holy water
Rip it in the holy war, check ‘em into post mortem
Document, fresh direct Ralph Lauren hoodie
When I be on the West Coast rock with [?]
The limelight fry ‘em like five-fifty Fahrenheit
Fire mics daily with ninety-nine terabytes
Bangers, I pop up with new angles
In the maze, navigating this game, so far made loose-
And dead-ends, crystal mint, James Brown, there it is
Walking it, talking it, making it all connect
Through instinct, full of god, Iron Mike in the straight
Mosey up and away, grab your rosary
Hoes be all up in the mix tryna cake off
Or be left with crumbs in the end while I take all

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
I’m straight boss, wave of my hand I make ‘em break North
I’m paid off, something like Bernie how I made off
Yours truly, got ‘em jumping like the horror movie
Shit your groupies move to couldn’t hardly move me
I’m that Beat Street Ramo with fuego
Pounds or pesos, don’t matter it’s all bueno
Pay close attention, mention my name: provoke tension
Bets in the game, there’s no question
This is Marco, Rebel on the job with the Large Pro
Lords of the Underground marked with the barcode
The Dark Knight, eyes on the city
Dimes on the sticky, overtime on my grissy
Mind on the moola, doola
Stepping with the superfly cougar and the personal Ruger
I’m through your brain like Hennessy black
Flow dawg, I’m a menace to rap, but stretching your crack

[Samples]
"Create astonishing lines"
"The flow is something amazing"

[Verse 3: O.C.]
Similar to Eastwood, roll in the gauntlet
Bulletproof bust but shots get to sparkin’
Create an idea, if there’s a problem I solve it
Maximize brain cells, glitter like garland
You can’t out-rap us, twenty-plus years been at this
Large Pro, I-N-S above average
This ain’t fire, this is arson
Big guns pointing at your toes, got rappers doing the Charleston
Breaking atoms send a spindle round your dome
When I hit ‘em, if I need help to Deck I shine a Wu emblem
M-Polo on the boss for dolo, whippin’ it like a Volvo
Picture this like a group photo
It’s a team effort, no need to fly solo
Bear witness, crown over mine, this would be the logo O.C
By design it was in the terrace
Simple A-U combined make it eighteen karat

[Verse 4: Tragedy Khadafi]
Gold bars, Libyan money, bloody the nozz
We the verbal gods, blow heat, discreet just to beat the odds
Exotic lodges, ménages, Khadaf is
Single-handedly murdering soloists and squadrons
This is vernacular, my poetry is spectacular
Bram Stoker choke the vocals of an amateur
Attack like terrorist plot from Afghanistan
African, we a pack of wolves, y’all a rack of lambs
Seven-and-one-half ounces of grand thoughts spilled
I’m like a shark with venom coming out of my gills
Behind enemy lines, ready for war still
Rhymes like extended clips spitting out of mack mills
Benevolent martyr, all my Gs scarred up
Mastered the art of these bars, word to the Father
Indigenous pharaoh, my thoughts travel
Like a hollow-tip through a barrel
Watch a universal battle
The magnum opus who’ll split an atom when he focused
We the titans in the cypher, y’all a bunch of roaches
Travel the Matrix in a time-portal spaceship
Visions of Euro stacks, better where my face is
Champion hoodie, shell-top with no laces
Queensbridge houses, nostalgic, most gracesA Toast to Mr. Tagalucci
And zipping open Louis duffle bags of lucci
Bragging loosley, 'bout bagging hoochies
No logos on the clothes but the tags say "Gucci" (nice)
And everybody raise your glasses
To beautiful tits and amazing asses
Bring cigar cutters and a tray for ashes
To money burials, hideaways, and stashes
Thanks to DEA's getting slick
They used bad tape, the charges didn't stick
The lawyers, Ebanks, Sadler
Life's a bitch and I probably could've had her
Here's to no witnesses
And playing dumb like "I don't know what this is"
I'm forgetful that's why I keep my shit full
Along with alarm systems and pit bulls
Good food, still needs seasoning
Gangsta POV, that's how we sees things
It's talked about with good reasoning
Over good steaks, and sweet Riesling
Yeah, Beef is just an entrée
Put stacks on a boy like his name "Andre"
All the shootouts and the killings
Sympathy for bad guys, rooting for the villains
I put my money up, loot is in the ceiling
And 2 baby nines that look cuter than some children
Cheers, blood, sweat, and tears
No room for emotions or fears
It's the way, nothing more to say
I make the call we could go to war today
This is Loso's Way
Follow me into Loso's Way[Verse 1: Kool G. Rap]
I'm bad to the bone with a style like Al Capone
I'ma smile while I give you the dial tone
Eatin shrimp and girls I be pimpin
Walk like I'm limpin, this brother ain't simpin
Not to mention, I'm winner of Mack Daddy conventions
I get a lot of attention
Sleepin in sheets that's made of satin
With one of my money makin honies, she's mixed Spanish and Latin
She's a fly type of swinger
Twenty carats on her fingers, minks on every coathanger
In a highrise, made for only fly guys
With a size that attracts the ladies eyes
Keepin the stash and the cashflow
Profile's kept low, more dough than Barry Manilow
Fly cars, I got diamonds in jelly jars
To earn respect, collectin bar fight scars
Slick talkin with a chick when I'm walkin
Midnight stalkin, all the suckers be hawkin
And I max while you be waxin your Cadillacs
Smooth as a fax, but I can cut you like an axe
Big spender, cause I'm a winner like Bruce Jenner
I burn all beginners and let em simmer like a TV dinner
On the phone cause I'm hard like stone
Holdin my own, cause I'm bad to the bone

[Verse 2: Kool G. Rap]
I'm gettin cash and ladies receive my passion
Parties I'm crashin with a flashy type of action
On stage I kick outrageous
And I enslave the bravest, more diamonds than Sammy Davis
I'm more dramatic than Dallas is
More pretty than a palace is, hands no callouses
Give me a clever girl and I'll outfox her
The man that rocks her in pure silk boxers
So what you want honey a chump or a champ?
Visa or food stamps, Latins or lamps?
I run the game like Sega
Go to war like Noreaga, hit like Schwarzenegger
Excitin when I'm fightin I'm frightenin
Stick chicks slick in quick like greased lightning
Ladies I'll love you all tomorrow like Annie
And I bet you'll all leave with wet panties
Cause I can make a eighty yard dash come back fast
Wrap rappers all up in the back like a jackass
Police wanna harass me
Cause I got all the material that has me lookin jazzy
The MC patroller
Pockets so fat, I flat em down with a dough roller
Dead zone when I strike the microphone
G. Rap's known, cause I'm bad to the bone

[Verse 3: Kool G. Rap]
I never needed a helpin handin
I'm outstandin, type of guy girls never abandon
The one who rollin with force, three across your belly
Knockin suckers out the box like I'm playin skelly
Cause I pull out the .45 if you offend me
And leave the barrel of it smokin like a chimney
Rhymes are dynamic, voice is titanic
Gigantic, suckers get frantic and then panic
A smooth talker, cause I'm a Queens New Yorker
My rhymes bring more Good Times than Jimmie Walker
A bumrusher, cause I'm a crusher of hardrocks
When I turn 30, I'll still be dirty as Redd Foxx
Try to cope, what I wrote, get a sore throat
My lyrical notes float like sailboats
I keep it steady for the petty sucker rappers I'll be ready
I got more bodies than Frank Nitti
Battles I win em cause I send em to Hell when I begin em
Because I put it in em like a venom
Discover the toughest rap brother you ever seen
Not a fairy, but milky like the Dairy Queen
Movin around like a smooth choreographer
Posin my hoes in all clothes for the photographer
On video, show I makin your girlfriend moan
Cause I'm bad to the bone5. "Halftime" – Produced by Large ProfessorThe first of two Large Professor instrumentals we explore is an up-tempo vibe created by trumpets, bass and tambourine that Nas rhymes over. Containing three samples:

Vocals and instrumentals from "School Boy Crush" by Average White BandBass from "Dead End" by Japanese Hair CastWhile the trumpets are from "Soul "Travelin' Pt. I (The G.B.E.)" by Gary Byrd

This was actually Nas first single. Fun fact: Busta Rhymes was offered the beat but passed on even though he love it, he didn't know what to write to it!4. "Onelove" – Produced by Q-TipThe track is in fact the early version of "Memory Lane" produced by DJ Premier. Q-Tip talks about the process, his inspiration for "One Love" and sheds light on their conversation about the production of the song:
I told him, ‘Yo, I’m going to give you some spooky sounding shit for your album.’ And Nas was like, ‘Yeah, I need that to capture the feel of what I’m saying. I need that crazy, mysterious shit.’ So that was the vibe of ‘One Love.’ I knew that it was going to be a classic track. I just knew it. It’s one of those special songs that when you work on it you know what it’s going to be."One Love" samples the piano and double bass from "Smilin' Billy Suite Part II" (1975) by the Heath Brothers. Additionally it contains a drum break from Parliament's "Come In Out the Rain" (1970), to add to the song's mystical and hypnotic soundscape!
3. "The World Is Yours" – Produced by Pete RockPete Rock draws from blues and some avant-garde jazz compositions. The track features scratches from Rock, mellow piano and drums. The song also contains one sample an one interpolation. The piano is sampled from "I Love Music" by Ahmad Jamal Trio & parts of the hook is an interpolation of "Its Yours" by T La Rock

Rock breaks down the process of the record and describes Nas as "the most incredible lyricist he's ever worked with"
2. "It Ain´t Hard To Tell" – Produced by Large ProfessorThis song was produced by long-time collaborator and mentor of Nas, Large Professor.  Large Professor, also known as Large Pro and Xtra P, is a New York City-based hip hop record producer and emcee. He is also best known as a founding member of the influential underground hip hop group Main Source

The track contains 4 samples:

Multiple elements from Human Nature by Michael JacksonRiff from "N.T" by Kool and The GangDrums from "Slow Dance" by Stanley ClarkVocals from "Long Red" by Mountain

It opens with guitars and synths of Michael Jackson's "Human Nature"; the song's vocals are sampled for the intro and chorus sections, creating a swirling mix of horns and tweaked-out voices. Large Professor looped in drum samples from Stanley Clarke's "Slow Dance" and saxophone from Kool & the Gang's "N.T." While you can hear background vocals shouting yeah from "Long Red". The production has an up-beat vibe and lighten mood with braggadocio rhymes!1. "NY State Of Mind" – Produced by DJ PremierPossibly Nas' most iconic record, "NY State Of Mind" is hip hop in it's purest form. The beat samples Joe Chambers' instrumental jazz composition, "Mind Rain". DJ Premier emphasized the lower tones of this sample, while complimenting with an alternate higher toned melody. The drums are consistent to Primo's classic boom-bap sound, and the inclusion off bass throughout provides a strong structure for Nas to flow on smoothly

At the beginning of this song, there is a portion without the sampled piano and a synthed high-pitch sound, higher than any piano note. This sound came from another jazz track, Donald Byrd's "Flight Time." Premier has said that this whole song was originally one verse, but he added the hook in the middle to give the audience a chance to digest the first verse and not be overwhelmed by one extremely long/complex verse!The greatest lyrics you ever saw
Thought you weren’t gonna be feeling my raps
So I hit you right back, my chap, with that raw
Come near and get tamped by the sound of the Lord
Your bitch tastes nasty why you fed her at all?
I’m indefatigable a disaster unstoppable, grovel in horror
[while] novels are torn up
We gotta get thru this rigmarole
To rid the world of immoral
The principle of tomorrow will be tripled if we organize
Come along the expedition to render existence exorbitant with dignified origins
Make a difference in your individual winnings
That’s why I slang blade quit bein auxiliary
Leading what is me to see unlimited visions super positioned on the fake irationers
Mistake no hate in us
They stay the all the same to us
Shuffling paper gettin paper cuts [when will I wake up]
The stories the same here
Let me explain the way SEE-I
I State the way’s gotta change
Elaborate it’s oil and hate
Exemplify we’re running out of time to chime, noxious gas collating in the sky, crime can disappear it’s you who decides- at what rate
Illustrate a better place-solar plated-cooperating-self optimization
-
Keep that thought in your brain when you’re down on faith
I’m phazin into operation, conflagrating inoperate daysmen dazed in outer space web of imagination- awakenin the deep messenger invaginating our masonry
Gathering the days, waiting for apposition to gain alchemy, opposition perspicaciously ousted, audi blade flakin monopoly
Make fair trade and not profit only, willing to wait like they say “Rome wasn’t built in a day”
But If the potentials’ unknown to you we’re exponentially growing into a quintessential no place called home -at godspeed rate~~
Having laymans change their saying more propitious and visionary
Quote them while I wake a new day now saying “create another every day, another Rome everyday”
That’s how we make way on to something more and greater
My thoughts delve into truth intuitively the more we make of it
Carrying on an auspicious now and later for posterity
Terraforming terra firma deliberately for a new age celebrate(d/ it)
New celebrity to make it what you make of it?
Not fake a bit, transforming fake kids to not fucking fake it
The place we met was it terraqueous ?
Oh wait it was Thrace, thrice I am right
It was when I was Spartan dying in the mightiest fight for light
For thy I gave life, a mighteous flight
Now My mind just right
Die decided
Am I right now
Readily and despite being on the dole, puff the loudest dro
On the prowl in the here and now I'll be cold
Determining where i’ll go with phronesis in my dome
Oh she give me dome like 15 minutes ago
You should watch where those lips go
When you talking you might get domed
Unless you uphold the holiest flow
Wholly and whole I (feel/fill) your ho
Ask me fi doe
I’ll think about it I give you the D in the meantime tho
Don’t mean to sound dross
Just me being droll
Give a mean bitch dome, a clean bitch home
I needa switch hoes, stitch holes, swish swishers
I don’t know if this vision is permissible it’s given
Episteme of mine expressed eloquently thru this techne
Technical vocabulary magically vanishing as rappers collab with mainstream
Daemons and fiends them
They feeding them merely tuppence
We’re the media of loving
In the media for nothing
Is it me or pure scruples
To believe in me or do nothing
Redeemed a new someone
I finna do something
And bid adieu all those in fronta me
Now visiting Eudaimonic *for good*It's about the time
Yeah... aha, aha
You know...
Yeah, word up

[Large Professor]
C'mon
Lights, cameras, action it's on
Straight outta gate with another hot song
Keepin real thou gonna last long
Break out the stiletto coming mad strong
Bounce if you wanna, lounge'll play the corner
I'm New York talking that gangster talk
24 bases, queue to the oasis
Suspicius see eyes and no faces
Been there, years just put in to work
For the dough, so you know that I couldn't get jerked
Street mental, throw on the hoodie then lurk
In the rental until the end of the earth
I'mma be that fellow with the mozzarela
Allways cooking up the new hot seller
Putting that money in the bank like the teller
And this be the number one rank, let me tell you

[Hook]
It's about that time

[Large Professor]
On the fast track chilling, creeping like a villain
In 2000 new car, new house and
Buy the whole store up, style I'm too pro, son
Get eaven more buckwild, I draw crowds and
In every state I still draw them at every forum
Don't loose no points I just score them
And count blessings at the top of my freshness
Live, get it right this is not no job
Today or tomorrow it doesn't matter
Got the stages moving on up the ladder
And stay grounded, remember the Bronx cause they founded
Cutting them old joints up by James Brown, kid
Golden, before I forget hold it
Got to shout out the block, four-fifth Colden
And Jamaica, Queens I'm true to the fort
Every day, all day not new to the sport
In the least bit, kids in Queens is who I feast with
When I ain't in the lab flipping beats with
Drums to pound, I be breaking it down
With homeboy Van on the way uptown
How that sound

[Hook]

[Large Professor]
There's a whole lot of rappers in the world today
Some good, there is some that got nothing to say
Some fake, some false, some imitation
But I'm the uncut raw for your generation
Work magic with terms like never before
Hang them rappers live, leave their head on the floor
Drop hits for the hiphop crowd that rock kicks and hats
Crisped jeans and whips to match
Hardcore system up on blast
Cock, dip and stash live now and forget the past
In the streets try to hustle while eating a meal
Watching out so you don't get beaten in the grill
Cause the crossroads is deep, sleep and you will
Be the next one up, I'm feeding the real
So get eardrums, son, and start heating the drill
One time and this is what y'all feel and I'mma still be[Verse 1]

On the block down Main Street
Where everything was sweet
Students went to learn in the building that changed me
From a baby boy to a fine young producer on the rise
I remember how they used to organize
In the corridors, in the staircases wild cutting
Some others was serious and some was 'bout nothing
Queens guys, we gluttons for punishment
Always in some shit
Everybody thought they was running it
Flushing, Corona, LeFrak & Jamaica
The four territories that would basically make up the student body
Chicks meandering through the lobby
With Polo Jeans and jewelry, my new hobby
Was scooping 'em, after school I was looping 'em beats
Sitting in the twelve twelve with Paul, Soup and 'em
Pulling off Superman all night sessions with G
Then in the morning go back with no sleep to-

[Hook]

Bowne, Bowne (Out in Queens)
Bowne, Bowne (Flushing to be exact)
Bowne, Bowne
Bowne, Bowne

[Verse 2]

'88, no '89, was the start of my prime
When I hit the auditorium and polished my rhyme
Was Professor Paul Juice, wasn't Large at the time
Trying to think of a line that I could launch at a dime
Kept the gear references real slick inside the verses
While others was popping shit and some sounded nervous
Me? I found my purpose
And finally, I could write a positive message
Cause teachers had their eye on me
Some tried to spy on me, over my shoulder
Remember one teacher asked what I wrote and I showed her
Read the shit out loud for the class but I was proud
Cause it all made sense and since
Yeah, I vowed to be Grand High Imperial, Large Professor
Know the one that be on the tape, bars of pressure
Then combine them little songs and do right not wrong
I owe it all to the institution now back home called-

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

So now the years float by on the calendar
And some of my peers, they know the guy from the ground up
Often appear, here and there and all around the
G-L-O-B, they roll out, they here the sound of the Do Double B?
In the halls and on the lunch lines, trying to impede
On the bars and the punchlines
Back in the days when I was basically unsigned
At one time
But dreams come true and now I'm
At the top of my game when I be laying it down
Walking on the same road I've been paving since Bowne
Everyday when I be making my way into town
Via Main and was ?  and I think about-

[Hook]

Bowne, Bowne (Out in Queens)
Bowne, Bowne (Flushing to be exact)
Bowne, Bowne
Bowne, Bowne
Bowne, Bowne (Down the block on Main Street)
Bowne, Bowne
Bowne, Bowne
Bowne, BowneBrothers ain't shit
They lookin' for the next big ass they can stick
But this here chick's not on your dick
Pulling your cars up close by the sidewalk
And got the nerve to get mad if I don't talk
Stay schemin' on how they wanna stick it from the back
A young muthafucka sellin' crack
Go home and go to bed son
Your just coming from the barber shop and tryna' get your head done
Take your ass downtown on 10th Avenue
Because a sister like me is not having you
Playa, going round tellin' other brothers that you laid her
So I guess I'll see your ass later
Some brothers approach you while your shopping
Their girl's not around so they're going ho-hopin'
From one girl to another
You turn your head for a minute, he's tryna kick it to your mother
Stop smilin'
I know all you wanna do is hit
And I really don't give a shit
They get mad cause I always look serious
So they swear I'm on my muthafuckin' period
I'm not impressed by the jewelry and the mink, dummy
Why don't you put some of your money in the bank, sonny
And if I hurt your feelings, I meant to
Cause these here pants, huh, you can't get into
Matter of fact I'm tooken'
So you brothers in the jeep can keep lookin' but I ain't hookin'
Yes I'm giving you the slip
All you can do is trick
Word
Cause brothers ain't shit

Brothers ain't shit
Brothers ain't shit

I'm on my way to the mall with a couple of friends
Some niggas pull up in a blue benz
A kid named Mark with dark glasses
Talkin' about 'Yo, y'all got some real fat asses'
I kept walkin'
Tracy stopped and started talkin'
With all these motherfuckers hawkin'
With that dumb looking grin
Bitch gets in the car that was carrying three men
I know the whole game well
They spend a little money, you end up at a hotel
Well that's how they planned it
She didn't wanna screw so they left her ass stranded
That's what she get for whilin'
Cold left the dumb bitch somewhere out in long island
Next time she'll act decent
And her moms won't have to come and get her ass from a precinct
Remember Shanté told you
Drugs is not the only thing a girl can say no to
You gotta watch every move that you make on the street
Word up, cause talk ain't that cheap
It may become a bad habit
You see a brother with a little bit of dough, you wanna grab it
I get approached by a man sometimes, I throw a fit
Word
Cause brothers ain't shit

Brothers ain't shit
Brothers ain't shit
Brothers ain't shit

Brothers ain't shit
So don't honk your horn keep rolling
No I don't wanna ride cause the shit might be stolen
Anyway, I know your number
You got a gas, grass or ass sticker on your bumper
Go ahead and say I'm stuck up
Cause I ain't doin nothing that'll make my rep. fucked up
Cause it happens to the best of us
Fuck the rest of us
Niggas keep testing us
A man can make you wanna kill him
Or late at night, make you wanna thrill him
He'll give you money, you can even be fly
But he still has to cheat and you wanna know why
That's the dog in him, 'woof, woof!'
That makes him get up in the middle of the night and go 'POOF!'
You say 'Yo, yo where you going?'
He's cheating and he's skeezing and your not even knowing
But this is what they usually do
Suck on the ting and they make you go 'WOO!'
And then he hits the door
And for the rest of the night you don't see him no more
He's got shit at your house, here's what you do
You should do some voodoo, hmm
Make his dick small
Make him see spiders on the wall
Then make him throw a fit
Why?
Cause brothers ain't shit

Brothers ain't shit
Brothers ain't shit
Brothers ain't shit
Brothers ain't shit[Intro]
Large Pro
It's my first Large Pro beat
You a genius nigga
I'm honored
And with them gray's in your beard
You lookin' more like a genius

Flushing Meadow Park, drive my heights 8 store
We playing baseball, then we slangin 8 balls
Mission impossible, Alley Cat he shot niggas, got shot too
Locked at the hospital
Jamaican Ave., chicken patty with the cocoa bread
I know Jamaicans on drugs, call em cocoa heads
Since lookin at the front door, always want more
So I got drugs pump and more
This is my belief, my philosophy, geography
Ecology, biology, psychology
I used to spit Gillette razors, hand in hand with my Pakistan man
We made papers
Fish scales from Jackson Heights Colombians
I.S. 61, was raised for no republicans
And I don’t mean to get all political
But Mitt Romney don’t plan to do shit for you

[Hook]
What the theory is, Sunlight to 1 at night, we the eeriest
Tell em what it really is
Built pyramids, ground up from the streets
It’s that Q talk serious
What the theory is, Sunlight to 1 at night, we the eeriest
Tell em what it really is
Built pyramids, ground up from the streets
It’s that Q talk serious

Yo, see I’m a student of a game how I pay attention
You so poor that you can’t afford to pay attention
Catch me downtown by L.E.S
Or up in Flatbush, Fort Greene by DYS, who you be with
My niggas I was locked up in Spofford with
Killers that'll kill killers marvelous
I know niggas never used a gun but got bodies
You can do the math, go and ask who you ask
A1 nigga since day 1, just ask
G-Shock watch, flooded with the black diamonds
Louboutins with the spikes is for weirdos
I’m hood nigga, I don’t wear those
Still a dapper dan, design still immaculate
Gucci ain’t make that, nah, but it’s they fabric
And still I get cabbage with, punch style
Gold piece Lazareth

[Hook]

Yo, you wanna fly in the city, you gotta go to Queens
Fly out of the city, you gotta come to Queens
My borough birthed John Gotti
And other killers, big drug dealers, wild ball players
Lamar Odom, World Peace Artest
Kenny Anderson, Kenny Smith, Lefrak the best, yea
Rafer Alston, Anthony Mason, Mark Jackson on a lay up line
They got action
Supreme court where I fought, but these ball playing niggas
Rep Queens on a court
Talik and Kimani could have made it
And Raheem manchild, the fuckin' hood favorite
Orchestrated, we sort of related
Black and Puerto Rican, like Los we stay faded cause
Yeah, on the real to the real, on the real to the real

[Hook][Hook]
What you reap, is what you sow
And what you keep, is what you owe
And what the people want to know is
Who's gonna catch the thrown?
And what you got, is what they want
And what they see, they sat they need
And people bleedin', from the greed
Now who's gonna catch the thrown?

[Verse 1: Chuck D]
Thrown at, thrown under
Thrown to the side
Throwing up disgusted, so we're throwin' down
Thrown under the bus draggin' on the ground
Power to the people salutin' the underground
Against those standing in mansions, spittin' down at us
From up their higher ground
Feed the people, fight the power, fix the poor
But that 1% done shut the door
In God we trust our money, it's a slap in the face
To the rest of the whole human race
Post racial wealth and taste, change a name
But you can't change race in the United States
People say they're kings, plus say they're queens
If we all don't eat, what does it all mean?
We watch and listen, but I'll leave it alone
But who's gonna catch the thrown?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chuck D w/ Flavor Flav as Hype]
Divide and conquer, the oldest trick in the game
Is the one between the people who are really the same
As the rich get richer, the poor get bitcin'
The people keep kissin', the feds don't listen
This recession's seen a black depression
Situation of a nation headed for desperation
No quaterback gets sacked on the couch
The sound of black America is ouch!
Governments don't love you and president executions
End up looking like some final solutions
Murder is an institution backed up and hacked up
By some handwritten, constitution
Do what you do! Buddhist, Christian, Hindu
Muslim and Hebrew, you're all what you do
I be seeing human beings that stew, yet
Never have so many been screwed by so few!
We watch the kings and queens and what they owe
But who's gonna catch the thrown?

[Other Hook]
There's a man
Going 'round
Takin' Names

[Verse 3: Cormega]
The system is designed to incriminate
Genocide was devised to eliminate
Equality is a myth!
They had me in jail for a crime I didn't even commit
A stereotype
They feel every color is inferior, right?
Brothers who resist are considered a threat
From Sitting Bull, to Malcolm X
In the land of the free, and suspect elections
John Kennedy had the mob connections
President Reagan sold guns to Iraq
Yet they try to say that criminals are all black
What's up with these corrupt politicians?
Them drugs they be shippin', but they never go to prison
This fucked up system better never try to bag me
Fuck Zimmerman, he's guilty, clearly!

[Bridge]
Catch the thrown!
You've got to testify
Is that the one percent that you need
Says that you occupy
Catch the thrown!
I've got to testify
Is that the one percent that ya'll want
You've got to occupy

[Other Hook]
There's a man
Going 'round
Taking names

[Verse 4: Chuck D w/ Flavor Flav as hype]
Free the mind prisoners, but they ain't listening
F tha po-po, but who dat whistling?
Foes making a killing, Juxtaposed against those givin' a livin'
Give me shelter, cause these issues be official
Is the need to feed replaced by the greed?
I ain't tryin' to yell at you or sell to you
Some B.S. they already told to you
End up being sold to you, did I mention?
The cheapest price is to pay attention
Now the test is just being at your best
With that you can hold your own
But who's gonna catch the thrown?

[Hook]

[Outro: Flavor Flav]
Ay yo Chuck, I think we got this shit under wraps, son
Dun said, dun said, dun said
Let's get the F up outta here, man[All Verses : Large Professor]

It was a long days work, you could finally cool out
And relax, and kick back, and look on to the perks
Of that nine to five, you stayed alive and strived
Each day, to make it happen up until you reach pay
Now its time, deposit your grip and grow
That dream that you've been having since a minute ago
With miles and miles of smooth road jogging dials
Lots of options, you eating fish, no crab or lobsters
Not an issue, god is with you
You've done good, your voice power under the hood
Is amazing for blazing trails into the uncharted
Part of life that everyone under the sun is startled by
The beating of the heart don't die
Cause I'm multi, sharper than a suit and a bowtie
Still, you got to get back to seal the deal
Yeah, you know that you've got to work
But you know that also that (You gots to chill)

Your cold feet up, you worker read up
Things is good, shit is selling like hot cakes
You the king of hood
Everybody got dough from slinging pot to blow
The block is a goal, and no pocket is low
Time to fall back, get out of this
Do remain anonymous
Don't let the greed got you into a lot of shit
That's the good word, my man, just acknowledge it
Time will make every dirty dollar legit
Its a shame you had to go that route, but you can throw that out
You got low, now you can go back out
Enjoy the fruits of your labour, from scooping all the paper
That wasn't nailed down, fuck hanging around
Till the boys come taking you away for that poison
Locking you up, letting you out when you like forty-something
Your empire's already built, you getting all the bread, yeah
But you that one day (you gots to chill)

(I just want to chill)
4x

Look at you, looking all nutty like a cashew
Running around, man, somebody goin' smash you
Frightened or not, you need to slow down
You moving too fast like a Rubik's cube, all mixed up
Got your chest poked out, boy, you Mr. Bigstuff
Just the other day you were talking 'bout shits tough
In the hood, where you be at
But now, where you be at
Around all them biatches, acting like biatch
A wise man told me I told you so
You be handsome, leave your pay for your children so
Our God is the greatest whatever date it is
On the slate kid, I put time like a state bid
Now I'm home free, at the door holding the key
Opening the door, that these ain't home for me
Still the one real, ice cold Brooklyn wheel
While I'm looking fucked up in the grill

(You gots to chill)
...yeah man
...large pro
...word up
...straight up
...ready?
...one, two
...here we go
...aite[Dolly Wilson]
Chorus (4x)
My coochie is soo juuicy, yeah

This right here is for all the girls
Who I used to talk to who didn't amount to be shit in life
You know what im sayin? All the girls who used to call
Their man on me when I was in front of the building
Just tryin' to get their numbers
Try'na put my seed up in 'em, you know..
All the girls who gave me a wrong number
When I just asked them for their fuckin' phone number
Tryin' to call 'em and hook up for a date and all that shit...
All the girls who left me in restaurants eatin'...
Talkin 'bout they gonna use the phone
And left me with the fuckin bill....

HA! It was all a dream, I used to read Playboy magazine
Niggas gettin' their dick licked with whipped cream
Women from all places, no matter what their race is
Mami wanna put punani where your face is
I said "Ha, Whut?" Put my face by her trap
Smoke weed, bamboo, lick her in her private spot
Way back before niggas even started smokin' crack
They used to act, proooo black
Remember Brand Nubian, 'One for all'?
Who ever thought Akinyele would get paid for grabbin' his balls
Now I'm in the strip bar, big rap star
Time to get laid, which one of y'all girls wanna get paid?
The lieu..tenant, sit behind windows tinted
Remember when I used to push cars that was rented
Now I cop the drop top, made thier hearts stop
Drive another block , they be like "yo, that was Ak!"
Huah! I stay away from the A-I-D
Pack condoms like guns cuz thats the way I be
One love to the late great Easy E
Larry Flynt, Hugh Heffner, and Ron Jeremy
Huah! I get pussy you know how I do
Call the crib last four numbers, ten-eighty-two
What the fuck??

My coochie is soo juuiicy, yeah (4x)

I can take the girl from the local streets
And take her to Cancun and fuck her on the beach
And Im far from cheap, I make sure all my niggas get laid
Open your legs girl, make some way, Hey-ay!
Around the way they used to diss me, girls never kiss me
Now they writing letters how they miss me
I never thought that hard work could pay off and shit
I was too used to jerkin' off and shit
Now the hunnies play me close, like the butter play the toast
When I'm grabbin 'em, I'll be baggin' them like a Coach
Condos in Queens, head blown for weeks
Feelin' up the cheeks of the 'put it in ya mouth' freaks
Raw sex is what I fear, so I pack condoms when it comes to this here
I hump bitch! A bunch of bitchs grabbed the family jewels
Considered a fool cuz I get more ass than a mule
Stereotype of a perverted nigga misunderstood....and its still all good

Chorus (9x)

Yea this for all the girls when I used to call they house
They see my number on the caller ID
And they never pick up the phone..fuck you...
This for all the girls when I call 'em
They answer their phone like "Hello" and when I say
"Its Ak" they act like their fuckin 'sleep..
Yeah fuck you...
This is dedicated to the Notorious B.I.G

Oh my-my coochie oh its so fuckin' juicy
Talkin bout my coochie oh its fuckin' juicy(8x)("Rappers go six feat under") (Repeat 4x)

You're scared straight as soon as G Rap penetrates
You wanna escape, but you got a date to meet fate
Run for your life when I'm starting
Suckers are getting turned to missing motherfuckers on a milk carton
Danger, when I rearrange and change a face, ace
You're being replaced by a stranger
I injure, and escape like a ninja
You got struck by a fucking revenger
A bullet inserted in your head, a shot got
Murdered, nobody seen shit, nobody heard it
Fuck around, the price is more than McDonald's pays
And you can sing my blues to Billie Holiday
Put your ass in my path and I'm a blast it
Mind over matter, I burn like battery acid
Terrorizing, sizing up the guys-a
Finger on trigger, when I pull it, a bullet flys in
G's a madman, came from the Badlands
Crush niggas in my bare hands like beer cans
Leaving a gash like the New York Slasher
Showing my inches in a trench like a flasher
You got a problem, I'm a problem solver
Solve more problems with a .357 revolver
Come near you pay dearly
And I can barely hear when you talk so speak up clearly
On a sole role, the golden mic holder
And I flatten your ass just like a steam roller
Pity for niggas I waste
Try to disrespect, get the taste of a neck brace
I got your ass on target
You got beef? You better save it for the motherfucking meat market
Rhymes choke you like a headlock
If a sucker's asleep, I turn his shit into Bedrock
Come on son, get done in
Niggas are running like the redcoats is coming
I enlist punk niggas that want some of this
And what's left is the breath of a death wish

("Rappers go six feat under") (Repeat 4x)

A pimp that loves shrimps and lobster
And for a hobby I'm hitting niggas up like a mobster
I got a story for each little poor territory
The ghetto glory in all categories
The death threats I received from the head vests
I'm riffing, the suckers stiffen up like a dead pet
The troop that stoops to brutality
Giving all nationalities a taste of reality
Kool G Rap is here to draw
And any sucker that tries to beat him, you meet him in a morgue
All victims unidentified, so check it
You gotta see if it was the sucker from the dental record
What I use to torture liars:
Either fire, barbed wire, live wire, or pliers
So you thought you could last?
Go and get a green thumb because your ass is grass
Eric B. is the undertaker
His pockets swoll because he's rolling in more dough than a baker
Quiet type, but I won't have it
Cause when I swing with the boys I get noisy like traffic
So if you know what I know, see what I see
G Rap is down with a mafioso posse
And I'm quick to go stick other suckers
With a smile just like a sick motherfucker
A bullet inside the sucker's guts and
Hit butt and his nuts, we throw him in the Hudson
This is for all the non-believers
They receive a gash in their ass from a meat cleaver
Don't even try to get fast
You know the time because I'm 5 seconds off your ass
A nightmare leaving you suckers breathless
You stepping to Kool G Rap, then that's a death wish

("Rappers go six feat under") (Repeat 4x)Who gon' do the math?

[Verse One]:
Imagine if 2Pac would have had kids
And left another soldier for the revolution
And what if them cowards would have never shot B.I.G.?
I bet he'd still spit
I bet it'd be sick
Imagine the '84 draft, Mike ain't get picked
What if #2 would have won all of those chips
Think Nike would have given son his own kicks?
Could you imagine the Bowie's instead of Jordans?
And what if Eazy ain't die, it was Cube instead?
Wouldn't be no Doughboy, wouldn't be no Craig
Shit, wouldn't be a Chris Tucker or Mike Epps
Imagine this type shit, imagine it's like this
If Martin never walked
And Rosa never sat
Would there be a Barack?
Could the prezzy be black?
Would there ever be rap without jams in the park?
With no Kool Herc and Afrika Bambaataa
Damn, I think nada
If Jaz-O would've popped
Would hypeman Hov have ever started The Roc?
I bet he couldn't bag Beyonce if not
Would he have had Carmen, would he have had Fox?
Could we have had Lox if Mary ain't tell Puff
That the demo was tough?
Would the Ryders be Ruff?
Would the product of Run DMC be the same
If Run was the DJ, would Jay have been slain?
Imagine Richard Pryor never snorted cocaine
Could Dave Chappelle excel when Martin had came?
What if Aalyiah's plane never hit rough terrain?
Would it still be the same?
Would she had married Dame?
What if that mary jane that we spark on the flame?
Wasn't illegal mane? Would you spark it the same?
Could you marvel at things if it wasn't what it was?
Would you wanna be thugs if there never was Bloods?
What if they wore gloves, walk around cleaning shit?
In blue overalls, you still wanna be Crip?
What if they ain't download, the music still sold?
You think me and Marco, Double Barrel went gold?
What if I knew Pete Rock, Premier and Large Pro?
And they all gave me heat to compliment the flow
And I played it for Buckshot and he was like, "Yo
We about to make Duck Down Records your new home."
What if Buck was Russell?
What if Dru was Rick?
Imagine Def Jam had the Boot Camp Clik
Imagine there's no food stamps, imagine there's no WIC
To take care of your kids, the hood would be sick
Niggas would be vics on the regular
What if they ain't enhance and advance the form of the cellular
Niggas carrying brick phones, forever brah
You couldn't text at all
Only accept a call
This is just some shit I think about in the lab
When I'm at half a bag and the beat's on blast
Some say it's food for thought
And some will just laugh
But how many of y'all is gonna do the math?
Who gon' do the math?

[Scratching]:
"You do the math"
"If you don't know the equation then you can't do the math" - Big Shug 'Capture (Militia Part 3)'
"You do the math"
"Multiplying fractions, now you know the half" - LL Cool J 'Life As...'[Intro]
What is the most important thing in-in Uncle Howie's life?
Drugs... drugs and music

[Hook x4]
"My drug music, theraputic to the user" - Mobb Deep
{*scratches*} Non Phixion - slam dance to it

(Verse One)
Y'all valley of the dolls, married to the mob
Fuck carry at the proms sabotage your god with the chron
Call my Dusk wildin, the rap Dennis Hopper, Black Helicopters
Smash a teleprompter blast in front the Black Sabbath concert
First role hospital nurse blow
Life is good in the hood and when I skis it snows
Portable hard drugs autoshotguns we got thugs
Get my cock sucked by rock groupies and pop sluts
Weird chicks, with big titties and pierced clits
Exotic dancers in love with Bill the fuck you think
Catch me at the bar, tripping off the drugs and drink
Bloods and Crips, coke dealing thugs and pimps
Under the influence of things I bring to drug music
To shootin' you up, with dope beautifully composed narcoctics
Its diabolical, your like a crack head prostitute
Without the loot, witness the music that's responsible

[Hook x4]

(Verse Two)
I'm fighting a war inside my mind, the more I've lost, the more I find
The mortified towards the skies, open wide rain warm
You get ya brain torn, brain storm till the pain gone
We gon' unify the streets against the beast so get your gang on
Hang on for life, OD, relevant drugs
Herion buzz, my team some intelligent thugs
Y'all fear emotion, my crew pack the dance floor
Like dance more me and my man's whore snap y'all like ham haul
Its like a jungle sometimes we life in gangland
Brooklyn, criminals thieves thugs and hoodlums
Cats'll pull they gun out, take over ya drug route
Then blow off ya legs and feet and order you to run out
I'm in a three piece on the streets like peace peace
But got guns for you cats who wanna see a cease beef
I don't breathe right, my life don't seem right
I don't see nights, and won't until my whole family eats right

[Hook x4]

(Verse Three)
I cop this Buick with the seats pulled out in the back ways
I keep an ugly pack a villains like killers and crab gangs
Some are religious fastness, some are hype, some others blastin
Some are dead or in jail fathers or young bastards
I pump the drug music, abuse beats I been through it
S.P's and MPC's, OZ's and QP's
Coke rocks to M3's Get jerz to VP's
Work our way up, we dont give a fuck who gets stuck
Getcha ate up, we saw the world layin' the cut
I coulda went to college, stay in bed with drug scholars
Prayin for bricks, fancy whips plants n kicks
Exotic chicks...tongue pierced blow with the pussy flicks
Like click click, the paparazzi trippin' off six
Ripping off kids, the shorty cat who whips with the clip
Like I'm in Vegas with a trunk a coke
Up in ya projects and ya never know I'm sellin soap
Smellin the dope
Hold the pope in Brooklyn how we took his wallet plus his laptop
Jumped in the whip, skidded to the neighbor's crack spot

[Hook x4]
