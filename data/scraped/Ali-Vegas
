[Verse 1]
Finally from every dimension with few restrictions
From up north to the youth detentions, I lay it down
Clear enough for who choose to listen, we all thorough
Infected by cruel intentions, but who the wise
The lies got two disguises, the surprise
Is to know when to utilize it, stay alert
The street talkers say the worst
So overall you gotta watch where you play in the dirt, it's just the rules
A killer could be just as cool, it's no image
Camouflaged right next to the
Fools, so who's who
It's the game that chooses you
A lot of shit is more easier to say than do, show and prove
Maintainers never blow they cool
Understand, every man should really know these jewels, I'm feeling live
Slim with a gorilla vibe
Away from haters cause I know what they feel inside, but never worry

[Hook]
Blowing cess in the dark (What your day about?)
Playing chess in the park (What your day about?)
Taking trips every week (What your day about?)
Spending chips on them freaks (What your day about?)
Getting money all night (What your day about?)
Betting houses on the dice (What your day about?)
Got your vest and your heat (What your day about?)
Get respect in the street (What your day about?)

[Verse 2]
Young in the mind with a old spirit
Hot blood with a heart that's so frigid, melodic music
Expressed through slow lyrics
I only spit it for the niggas that hold digits, and don't front
I know about the coke blunts and Remy nights
Got a cousin up in Elmira sending me kites
I'm felt, the ice in my ears don't melt
I could drink a whole bottle for delf and won't belch
Believe it's the same me ducking the D's
Eighty-six with the do-rag, cuff in the Lee's
Appraise this, biological' I'm ageless
Psychologically, I show amazement
Salute, been blessed with the [...?] of a coupe
Hoping the real just respect what I'm trying to produce
Quiet Money is the empire, bigger than rapping
Fuck niggas cause I been fire, that's what's that

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
From the streets to the track board
Bubble up, from the crack to the rap laws, visualize
We all uncivilized, the trained behavior
As kids taught to memorize, copy and mimic
I travel through the blocks that's dimmest
Fly nigga, use my teeth to pop the top off a Guinness, never hate
With the hunger of a heavyweight
I stay balanced in the mind when I meditate, and blow trees
Every verse is like a o-z
I know niggas in the 'hood like they know me, so no beefing
It's nothing that could stop me from eating, too in tune
Taught to heal through the doctrines and teaching, redeemed
For women I'm the man of their dreams, stand alone
When I zone nothing coming between, let's get money
The trick is to flip money, double up
Dirty or legit money, it's all the same

[Hook 2X]*song includes Ali Vegas imitating other rappers*

(Ali Vegas - talking)
Rest In Peace to my nigga Mel, this song dedicated to you
Yeah, I sit back and I hear niggas saying "Damn, Vegas you sound like this
Nigga, you sound like that nigga"
They always compare me to greats, so a nigga can't never sound wack
Cause they compare me to every nice nigga that was ever in the  game
So I wonder what them niggas be saying

[Ali Vegas *Jay-Z*]
Gather round hustlers, that's if you still living
Black Album dropping, who's gone fill my position
Um...It's not often I lose
Who's the next king to walk in my shoes
The prince of New York, that's an awkward dude
His walk and talk is so smooth
Vegas be the talk of the news
He might just be the one
L.O. get that lil nigga on the phone
Cause I need to speak to son now

[Ali Vegas *2 Pac*]
Pistols popping at visionaries
Niggas is getting buried
Different worries, living is getting scary
Rappers rapping bout what happen
Fame and fashion, guns blasting
Bust they don't share the same passion
That's why he gone outlast em
Fasten ya seat belt, Vegas'll make a beat melt
Him against the world he don't need help
And all my niggas stuck in the pen
Ya can't deny it, he a Southsider ya don't fuck with him

[Ali Vegas *Nas*]
Back in '99 when I first heard his CD
I looked, damn an illmatic version of me
A young'n with fame thorough with game
New ruler of the borough I claim
Thoroughest lames would huddle in gangs
Thinking bout what they gone do
Vegas keep doing ya thing
Cause can't none of these young niggas fuck with you
They having a thought of spazzing in court
Half of his rock and half of his mark to the stash of New York

[Ali Vegas *Notorious B.I.G.*]
Quiet when I speak to you
La put the heat to you
Real king of New York, I'm dying in my vechicle
Like Frank White, Ali Vegas got his bank tight
Now competition can't think right
Y'all all know me, I'm the one that put the mac in roni
Top of New York like T.O.N.Y
Too many niggas tried to clone me
Truly yours, prince of New York but P.O.N.Y to you homie
You know me

[Ali Vegas *Eminem*]
Uh-oh, here we go again
First time out y'all didn't notice him
Now he gets on tracks and his roasters them
Tommy Motolla and Universal is back in control again
Casa Blanca, that's like a second home for him
50 million is a lot of dough to spend on a rapper that's going to blow  again
Who wanna go toe to toe with him?
Nobody, he squeeze triggers like Eastwood
I can't say nigga, but guess what he could

[Ali Vegas *Busta Rhymes*]
It was a cold stormy nigh chilling on Flatbush Ave
That's when my man past and pulled the CD out the stash
Said I needed to blast, I pulled over the whip before I crashed
At last, prince of New York is all in ya ass

[Ali Vegas *Ma$e*]
It be the same cats that wouldn't listen to his demo
Now want info, black on black limo
Flood any tempo, it's simple
Anything he drop hot, even if it pop like a pimple
Popo, now he loco
Raspberry no more coco
Ya know how fast an O go, if not you a doe doe
No more slow dough, sho dough
Hardcore no more go go
But y'all already know tho

[Ali Vegas *Nelly*]
Straight from the down, down
I hear dirty is getting right
Knew he was nice when I heard 'em on the mic
Girls holla'n E.I., niggas they wanna fight
Told dirty don't worry he gone be aiiight
I said his pimp juice got him feeling under the gun
Told 'em he got what it take to be number 1
When it's hot in here bitch niggas'll run
Don't worry about it they all gone be stunned

[Ali Vegas - talking *Madd Rapper*]
Naw son, Naw son, Naw son, Yo Vegas, Naw son
Ya not breaking the whole song down on these niggas
Don't let these niggas think you just doing this
Just cause you wanna sound like niggas
Word to my mother, if y'all going to compare my son
Then y'all need to compare all them niggas son
Cause all them niggas sound alike
Word to my mother from Jay to Nas, all them niggas sound alike
If you speed the nigga Jay up you get Nas
If you slow the nigga Nas down you get Pac
You take away Pac doubles, you get B.I.G
You take away B.I.G. doubles, you get Slick Rick
This is all a family tree
Y'all need to stop comparing niggas and just let niggas eat
Fuck it who knows you slow me down you might get every rapper in the  game
I might sound like the nigga Vegas when you slow me down
Try that shit out[Nas samples] (Hook)
"You know it's like that, you never get the mic back
I got it hemmed, When I...When I...attack
There ain't a army that could strike back"

[Nature]
Ayo, on hot summer days I sit under AC
Slow mo, bumping Jo-Jo KC
Life shit be the theme cut, clean cut image
When me and Ali teamed up you can't fuck with us
Fuck niggas if they can't accept it
Under paid need to check in the mail every twenty days
Watching the funny ways of them record execs (executives)
Get em hog tied and thrown in the trunk for a long ride
Never let a wrong slide, two wrongs don't make a right
Fuck your whole cassette, two songs don't make you tight
Need at least eight or nine of them, possibly ten
Stay rewinding em, they pop go then you cop one again
It don't stop until your pay checks gone
Bootleggers in the street wait for Nat's next song
I stay warm, until the day that I decide to cool off
Who lost?, we be the hottest muthafuckas out of New York

[Hook (Nas samples)]

[Ali Vegas]
Ayo, I kick poetic scriptures
Fake willies get Mote off bitches
I throw up at yo sister's on my quest for riches
Put some lead through snitches
I'm from the same home the Giants, Yankees, Mets, and Knicks is
Still surviving the block, putting pies in the pot
Nature still fighting with cops
Got real niggas that'll gag your wife with a sock
Get your little mans sliced with an ox
Risk life in the box, just to get near the ice on your watch
Stay with cool intentions, fuck trials and school suspensions
Only listen to rap if the jewels ain't mentioned
They know my pen is flawless like my women
Gorgeous Kim's in George Prince
Wolves stay with chrome four-fifths
I rap professionally now
Commentators ask the specialist how...
Long it took before perfecting my style
Even with a deal I got more bills than Destiny's Child
Y'all know it's like that, so fight back
I'm reckless and wild

[Hook (Nas samples)]{samples are Prodigy from Mobb Deep}

"Your store bought rap ain't shit.."
"..that's why your small rhyme bore me"

"My category: rap-rap science.."

[Ali Vegas]
Yo
The drama bound to stun you before the gun do (blaow)
Better have a spot to run to, stash your bundle
Blue and whites come through, lookouts want us
That's wrong how they had they guns drawn when they run up on us
Hearse I'm under, words dem bug us, it's how they search and slug us
For wearin certain colors on the drug strip
Full of duck chick that love chips
Where I live, you get your mug split
For tryin to stunt and pose, in front of hoes
I leave a dozen froze and they cousin closed when I come in shows
Me and my lows rock Wolverine ?, and Timbos
Everyone in my kin knows, my squadron foul
I run with opportunist problem childs
That like the robbin style, pussies that act hard and smile
You better guard your pals, cause I'm 'arnin you
Informin you, Ali Vegas do what he wanna do
And I'mma rep Queens just like I was born to do
What nigga?

"..that's why your small rhyme bore me"
You can't revoke my pass
"My category: rap-rap science.."

Rhymin is fundamental
Peep the game they put the yung'un into
Sprung off a instrumental, holdin guns inside a rental
Rap is 10% lungs, 90% mental
But what I want-a know is who sent you
To get on quick, rock with the team I was born with
A cash hustle, my whole staff tussle
And leave you with a bullet in your calf muscle
(one more thing) My verses crush you
Bring it to Cardan and A+ too
Cause they think they tough Boo
If it go there, I let my staff rush you
But y'all cats better recognize
Ain't nobody seein Ali Vegas, recordwise
My team, we be on ? Duke, your team is butter new
Top talent critics is sayin Waterloo
Ali have the chickens, sayin what a cure bastard
Urban wolves got the game mastered
And everybody on my team is way past sick
Nigga what?

"..that's why your small rhyme bore me"
"Your store bought rap ain't shit
Call me the specialist, professional.."
"..that's why your small rhyme bore me"
"My category: rap-rap science.."
What y'all gon do now man?
"..that's why your small rhyme bore me"
"Your store bought rap ain't shit
Call me the specialist, professional.."
"..that's why your small rhyme bore me"
"My category: rap-rap science.."

Like this Jamaica Queens pharoah tale
How my life is parallel to them inmates
Livin inside a narrow cell
The drug lords have shootouts on carousels
I done seen it all
The average baby couldn't breathe or crawl
I was watchin fiends and whores screamin brawl
Outside of convenience stores, y'all can't stand it
Half of the fam split, we lost Tash
Keith Dolla Bill, Uncle Pook Seville, and The Bandit
My music bump, on every avenue, boulevard, and Van Wyck
I have to sell my records with a pamphlet
So y'all cats can get the spot and muscle, to find a hustle
We down to tussle, we'll clown and crush you
Mellowed out, but still a sinner down to bust you
Y'all know the code of the streets
Keep a toast when you sleep
Stick up kids be patrollin the streets
And if you fold on your peeps
Wake up slain with holes in your Jeep
Nigga what?

"..that's why your small rhyme bore me"
"Your store bought rap ain't shit
Call me the specialist, professional.."
Maintain, Ali Vegas
"..that's why your small rhyme bore me"
"My category: rap-rap science.."
Got the game sewn, get your brain blown
"..that's why your small rhyme bore me"
"Your store bought rap ain't shit
Call me the specialist, professional.."
Jamaica Queens thing y'all
"..that's why your small rhyme bore me"
"My category: rap-rap science.."[Verse 1-Ali Vegas]
Yo
I was forced to live it
Other cats was brought up in it
Surrounded by drug spots, cemeteries, abortion clinics
I watch my older strong arms grow soft and timid
Until he got caught he sentenced and now he forced to been with
Up north's the sentence, I found a team to score and win with
And until this day we haven't lost a scrimmage
We floss a minute, we always know where to draw the limit
See the rich cop expensive shit to get the poor offended
My whole click related, until we situated
Seen five out the top ten that made it
Ballon'll get inflated due to diamonds and karats
The finest and fairest designed to blind the mind of a savage
Luckily I was raised by the Adriatic
That taught me how to keep my lyrics flaming crazy rapid
And still maintain an 80 average
Since Vegas was in a baby carriage
I always knew I would never sick of that train and care shit
I want to make the same impact that cocaine and crack did
What can I say I guess my moms raised me backwards
The streets ain't never offered me shit but a waiting casket
If I run I'm scared, but if I stay I'm dead

[Hook-Ali Vegas]
I'm confused
Sometimes I feel like I can't lose
Come back down to reality and tap the concrete with my shoes
I'm confused
Sometimes I feel like I can't lose
And my people keep telling me "Dog, get a grip"


[Verse 2-Ali Vegas]
We all awaiting Christ, others got money awaiting dice
Me, I had to stick with the stage and mic
My mother told me them toes that you step on today might be connected to that ass you kiss later in life
So I'ma take it like...
Throwing dice in great cracks, spending nights in state slacks
Life's a payback
I say life is a gift
They say with ever thing comes a price and a risk
Sleep was always nice with his fist and I was twice nice with the fifth
Eyes you to swift, I always wondered why the wise didn't rip
And why politicians always replace their lies with a myth
My mother always handled family ties with a twist
So I perfected my why's and my if's
So many try but they miss
When I die and I'm stiff, I want my music to be recognized more than this
I put a lot of thought in this since the days of being sent to the stores with lists
I decided rather poor or rich, Crisco is the closet I'm gone come to pouring Cris
And my rap lines is never bordemness
Just close your eyes and pick a side of the bone, I guess I got the shorter end

[Hook-Ali Vegas]
I'm confused
Sometimes I feel like I can't lose
Come back down to reality and tap the concrete with my shoes
I'm confused
Sometimes I feel like I can't lose
And my people keep telling me "Dog, get a grip"


[Verse 3-Ali Vegas]
Ayo it's hard to live where them losers crack jokes on retarded kids
And disrespectful kids get barred from the crib
Other cats stacking O's, dodging feds
God forbid I do something on earth that'll scar my kids
Lord knows my father did, starting fights in the bar with Mike
You get beat bloody with rods and pipes, just because you scar they knights
My squad will strike if the odds is right
Hundred killers with cars and bikes, hopped out on me and my moms one night
We had to flee in the lightning and rain
Now I see why Sleep smoke tress to ease and lighten the pain
As long as ideas keep enlightening the brain, and I keep writing them flames
Then I'ma be aiight in this game
Forget fighting with dames, keep it tight and my cypha won't change
Even if some judge try enditing the game
Most of y'all swift with the hands, but light in the aim

Yo I'm confused son...*samples Capone-N-Noreaga - Invincible from album "The Reunion"*

[Hook]
The invincible untouchable Ali Vegas y'all
You ain't...you ain't ready yet
The invincible untouchable Sleepy Eyes
You ain't...you ain't ready yet

[Ali Vegas]
Ayo it's a stick up
Y'all know how the game go
Cop the milk trucks and fuck the Range Rove
We stained those game hoes, and spit at same flows
Leave D's in they clean clothes with they brain exposed
Explain to foes that diamond is what I seek to do
My rhymes is more electrifying than Pikachu
Poke'mon, hoes stroke the don in every town
Fuck Cristal, my team sip very fine Welches grape
Before rap I delt with niggas that delt with 8's
Heavy not welter weight
We could bust gats
Y'all gotta cut crack to touch stacks
I rather bust raps
What black, y'all bust at me I bust back
Throw your middle fingers up and yell fuck that (Fuck That!)
We all know that I could drench yo crew
And Vegas and his Wolves is invincible
So what y'all want?

[Hook]

[Ali Vegas]
Ayo Vegas leave niggas sitting scared in they homes
Let a flare from the chrome that'll tear thru yo dome
My raps is more exclusives than a pair of new foams
Everybody know suicide is what I really condone
Don't want nobody in the hood swearing on tone
B.I.G. was the king of NY and I am here to heir the throne
Fuck who's the realist MC, cause I'm the livest one
Y'all Jordan, Magic, & Bird and I'm Iverson
Got no respect for the best of them
Can't be checked by the rest of them
That's why I neglected them
All drama I'm addressing them
Fuck the refs and them
I know me and team be vexin' them
They know my Wolves deserving
What happen when we start splurgin
Come thru yo block swerving in two Serbians
Back to back blue Excretions
Yeah my team need the benefit, cause we put the work in

[Hook]

[Sleepy Eyes]
Sleep is like a soldier at war, explosive and raw
Squeeze the black toaster you fall
And leave yo back broke with yo jaw
Mr. Pick Yo Lock And Open Your Door
Hit yo spot at 6 o'clock in front the grocery store
Speaking the slang loudly
Floss braids proudly with suede Ballys
Remain rowdy with guns that'll keep my brain cloudy
Bang like a gang rally as the earth is twisting
Burn the insect, liquor burned my system
Rapping was my third addiction
Never preferred to listen
Serving chickens
Living where civilians and innocent children turn to victims
Trying earn a living, I'd rather drop some words of wisdom
Took the urban rhythm, poetry mixed with journalism
Who wanna harm me?
I'm equpited enough to rip your arm piece
Squeeze, them clips breeze like leaves on plam trees
Sick with it, spit lyrics that grip spirits
Made of art, fuck a turn it to posion cause the kids hear it

[Hook][Verse 1]
Ayo
I know we starving in the hood
We party in the hood
Sip kool-aid and Bacardi in the hood
Only one problem in the hood
Bus trips out west, damn the kid's hardly in the hood
We move ready in the hood
We heavy in the hood
Illegal two-ways and celly's in the hood
Come thru the block bumping Nelly in the hood
Like Unduly Unduly Mami E.I
What's popping tonight
Mami looking proper and tight
Parking lot pimping, black sock on the flight
Y'all know how we do chicks in the hood
House party style yelling SWITCH in the hood
It ain't hard to get rich in the hood
No credit don't sweat it, we got Sprint in the hood
And these chicks is insane, they put they lips on the grain
No blinkers when I'm dipping thru lanes
Vegas is back, watch them start forgetting your name
Don't care about broad I pimp em the same
They keep begging me to stay 'till the morn
But it came to me like my favorite B. I. G.  song
*plays short clip of B. I. G.  song*
And if y'all know it then y'all all sing along
Get the bitch, get the pussy, get the math I'm gone

[Hook]
This is for my gangsta's and gangsta chicks
And all my gangsta cliques
It don't matter what set you claim, just respect the game
And party to this gangsta shit

[Verse 2]
When it comes to relationships, Vegas is very horrible
Let me explain a few things the young broad'll do
Promise you the universe, only give you a star or two
Once he got your mind, he don't give a shit about your heart or you
Most chicks thinks all it takes is a lie to hear
And the hottest gear, to earn their dollars here
Let me stop you there
They get comfortable, I take them on my favorite date shop and stare
Cause while I shop they watch and stare
And please don't comment on the watch my dear
I got a lot of gear
Parda down to Roc-A-Wear
Plus I dress better than most of these niggas' closet there
I could pull up to a packed strip, in a crashed whip
And still bag the baddest bad bitch
Take her to Flagship and give her X and grape goose
Hood rats say Vegas and the models say Bruce

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I had one gangsta chick, the rest was nutty
Ma if your head proper, I'll take you to Red Lobster
And let you get 45 shrimp instead of 30
Her head was nervy, I jetted on birdie
They wanna go on dates with me
Key to my empire so of course they skate with me
They wanna pay they respect to the late great with me
Kendal Jackson, in front of lakes with me
They wanna eat cheesecakes and Welches grapes with me
They wanna go half on a... and stay with me
I done shouting at hoes, cause I could talk on
East coast shake it up, West Coast get your walk on

[Hook][Nas (Akon)]
Shakedown (Uh-oh-oh); Akon, Nas, here we go New York
(Uh-oh-oh) Here we go world, here we go y'all
(Uh-oh-oh, Cause it's a shakedown, uh-oh-oh)

[Ali Vegas]
The streets'll do whatever just to see me fail
Mama'll do whatever to keep free from jail
So she tellin' me to get my CDL
But papi said he got some things that we could sell
To turn the corner and to see VVS's
He said you liked girls to get beneath their dresses
You gon' need them SS's, VVS's, BBS's
Here go the keys to the Lexus (Uh-oh-oh)
Now I'm the center of attention like Kareem and them
My squad run around the borough like we Prem' and them
My gang with big truck, wifey's we beamin' them
Let's Esco, that tag team from Queens again
This is Shakedown, here go the breakdown
The big boys are back; 'lil niggas get off the playground
I got up with the homey A now
The kid babies 'bout to make the Earth quake now

[Hook: Akon (Nas)]
Uh-oh-oh, we back now
A bunch of gangsters strapped so make a way now
When they come wavin' them gats you know the lay down (Lay it down)
And give 'em all you got, cause it's a shakedown (Shakedown)
Uh-oh-oh, (New York to H-Town)
We back now (Here we go y'all)
A bunch of gangsters strapped so make a way now
When they come wavin' them gats you know the lay down
(Uh-oh, Nas and Akon, uh-oh, Nas and Akon)
And give 'em all you got, cause it's a shakedown
Uh-oh-oh, (Here we go)

[Nas]
My man was smart
Robbed the bank, buried the cash
Did ten years, came home and bought him a Jag
Other side of town, stick-up kids ride around
Young niggas not prepared this time around
Walk in the jewelry store yellin', "Get on the floor"
Snatched the sales lady up, hit her with the bulldog
Grabbin' the ice, the heist went fast as the Vice
Had rushed in, bussin', could you imagine this life?
The streets come alive and laugh at your sorrows
Leavin' your soul hollow
That you fill it back up liquor bottles
Black Messiah had the jux, 20 ki's uncooked
Easy to push, some Japanese dealers were crooks
They leave niggas eyes cut out; what it means to us
He seen too much, but we don't give a fuck
Black truck pull up to the door
Infa-green night vision lens we can see through the war
"Get on the floor"

[Hook: Akon]
We back now
A bunch of gangsters strapped so make a way now
When they come wavin' them gats you know the lay down
And give 'em all you got, cause it's a shakedown
Uh-oh-oh
Do I make myself clear, uh-oh-oh[Ali Vegas-Verse 1]
Before Ali became a don and gave his arm to melody
He swore to never set her free
He tricked on her, to get on her
Even let his click spit on her
Lyric tried to warn her, the more she wondered the more she confused her
The more she loved him the more he abused her
She introduced him into the trifest game, she even iced his chain
Who would've thought his life would change
The split second melody chose to give him twice his fame
Vegas was six when he first met her, ever since then he thirst cheddar
It was like God broke off his birth to inherit the earth
He would talk to her smoothly and others would cruse
It was time for the youngster to speak
She told him to stop running the streets and never loose his hunger for beats
Make her number one and she guaranteed to place Ali Vegas amongst the elite

[Ali Vegas-Verse 2]
Together they had to game sown
Did a few street promos to get his name known
She said she know a few cats that seen dough
She thought them the difference between dough fats and primos
It's like telling a saint from healer, them two make the most distinctive mixture
He would tell her stories and she would paint the picture
They made the most flagrant scriptures
Everyday they met with A (AZ) and Nas
In the studios he spit the most amazing bars
Melody and lyric could really take him far
All they needed was a technician, that was they next mission
To find a producer that had the best vision
It's because of her he take vacation a choice
Engineers'll pull strings to play with the bass and the voice
She should him things that most would never get to see
I won't get rid of you, until you get rid of me

[Ali Vegas-Verse 3]
Yo Vegas felt it was time he put her under the wing
Take her places, show her things the average girl ain't never seen
Before he said "I do" and handed her that ring
All he needed was to know some things
If he was to die today would you cry for him?
If he was to be questioned by Jake's would she have an ably for him?
Would she take the stand knowing she had to lie for him?
Baby girl are you down to die for him?
If you down then we down for life
We could hold our heads up high and show up our crowns of ice
I know some people say never say never
But I'mma say I'll never leave you we together forever[Verse 1-AZ]
Indecent thoughts, (???) niggas seeking support
Thief niggas never last, most sneak and get caught
Peep the cross, weak convos keeping it short
Shit shaky, shook niggas leak in they shorts
Who rule this, I run thru this unstrapped and foolish
Niggas is jeweless, feeble minded, young and foolish
New era, to me it's who whatever
Blunts, bottles, bitches, we could do whatever
I'm a made nigga BK, my trays is bigger
Niks is sick, dimes could eat away at yo liver
Live in the flesh
Two faced canvassers the best
Street repper, loved it (???) was the best
AZ and Ali, how we spit is how we sit and poly
It ain't shit, respect the game

[Verse 2-Ali Vegas]
Don't worry bout it A, I got it from here
Ain't shit gone change, I'm still the same nigga
Young face, old soul, powerful brian

Aiight
Back when Cat was running Queens, New York
I had a younger singer talk, gun slinger walk
Slanging chalk inside a Lincoln park, fiends and narks
Shine like a rainbow, A speak into the mic with a strange flow
Everyday that light in my brian glow, Brettas and white Drangos
Ever since Nikes and Kangos, rap was mine
I mastered lines to make old vets feel pass their prime
My staff'll shine off my shash of rhymes
Half the time you catch me cooking O's
Crooks and foe stand shook and frooze when Vegas open up his book of flows
I'm off the hook with thoose
Punching niggas, mushing hoes
Sosa copped a Velar jacket to match with the four-matic
Ali Vegas is a raw savage that'll squeeze off and let y'all all have it
Now here it goes[Intro]
Yah, Queens nigga
Ali Vegas
Generation gap spokesman for the youth
L.E.S., urban wolves y'all
Big things connection, yah
Yo how you going y'all check it

[Ali Vegas]
Yo, yo have you ever had to change huddles
Move to a differant hood see the same struggles
Crab routines got the game muffled
Old players wish to death but got the same shuffle
One move could leave your brain puzzled
That's why I stress essentials, bless the tempo
With knowledge that perfects the mental
Come to Queens see what the rest is into
I lost a round but it won't happen twice
I got emcees on their knees steady asking christ
How come when they was Ali's age they wasn't half as nice
I treat a vet just like an ap-pren-tice
Cause the words I speak is more street than crack and dice
I was put here to rap, L.E.S. let me hear the track
D.O. know I spit a verse make the snare collapse
Any affair I'm at my peers is strapped
From up north to the telly
And all my peers caught in the belly
Living life similar to bums sincere black

[Chorus]
Another day, another dollar, another nigga in court (whats that)
That's the theme of New York
And if you dont plan to play hard
You might as well stay the hell off the court
That's the theme of New York (I ain't going nowhere)
Where the hustlers work hard for their cash and they hate taking shorts
That's the theme of New York (the system got them locked down)
And all the grimey niggas plot and scheme
To take the shit that you bought, that's the theme of New York

[Ali Vegas]
Aiyyo these New York City streets is hot
Even police get shot
Neighbors never speak a lot
And citizens they beef with cops
Avenues flooded with p.c. shops
And reifer spots
My place is a sneaker box
Some say I need to stop
Others ask me  when my cd drops
I tell them when they stressed to hear it
I got felons serving like me while the rest they live it
I walk the streets at night but never pivot
Only bullets swerve my words
Go through your vest and wet your spirit
Y'all critics got a lot of nerve
I'm him to the third
A new king has emerged
From out of queens by turning verbs into perfected lyrics
And tommorrow they'll say

[Chorus]

[Ali Vegas]
Yo police blitzed the crack game
Drug alias switched to rap names
Fat chains attract fame
Innocent wigs get split when gats flame
Cause the ignorant mix their wits with bad aim
A young brain stormer
Hit harder than hurricane Carter
A mental sparker
We can rhyme to see whos pencil sharper
You are raps newest propaganda
Speak with smooth and proper grammer
Planets start minana
Turning cash legal
Just imagine if wanna cap people
Impregnate the rich daughter of Rich Porter
And create a crack sequel
Now thats lethal
What you say gangsta

[Chorus]

[Ali Vegas sung]
I dont kow the plan
The system snatched half of my dynasty
I dont want to leave the city
But I know one day they'll try the real on me
(so what you say, what you say gangsta){samples are Prodigy from Mobb Deep}

"Your store bought rap ain't shit.."
"..that's why your small rhyme bore me"

"..that's why your small rhyme bore me"
Check me out yo
"My category: rap-rap science.."

[Ali Vegas]
Yo
The drama bound to stun you before the gun do (blaow)
Better have a spot to run to, stash your bundle
Blue and whites come through, lookouts want us
That's wrong how they had they guns drawn when they run up on us
Hearse I'm under, words dem bug us, it's how they search and slug us
For wearin certain colors on the drug strip
Full of duck chick that love chips
Where I live, you get your mug split
For tryin to stunt and pose, in front of hoes
I leave a dozen froze and they cousin closed when I come in shows
Me and my lows rock Wolverine ?, and Timbos
Everyone in my kin knows, my squadron foul
I run with opportunist problem childs
That like the robbin style, pussies that act hard and smile
You better guard your pals, cause I'm 'arnin you
Informin you, Ali Vegas do what he wanna do
And I'mma rep Queens just like I was born to do
What nigga?

"..that's why your small rhyme bore me"
"Your store bought rap ain't shit
Call me the specialist, professional.."

"Your store bought rap ain't shit
Call me the specialist, professional.."
I'm here now y'all
"..that's why your small rhyme bore me"
You can't revoke my pass
"My category: rap-rap science.."

Rhymin is fundamental
Peep the game they put the yung'un into
Sprung off a instrumental, holdin guns inside a rental
Rap is 10% lungs, 90% mental
But what I want-a know is who sent you
To get on quick, rock with the team I was born with
A cash hustle, my whole staff tussle
And leave you with a bullet in your calf muscle
(one more thing) My verses crush you
Bring it to Cardan and A+ too
Cause they think they tough Boo
If it go there, I let my staff rush you
But y'all cats better recognize
Ain't nobody seein Ali Vegas, recordwise
My team, we be on ? Duke, your team is butter new
Top talent critics is sayin Waterloo
Ali have the chickens, sayin what a cure bastard
Urban wolves got the game mastered
And everybody on my team is way past sick
Nigga what?

"..that's why your small rhyme bore me"
"Your store bought rap ain't shit
Call me the specialist, professional.."
"..that's why your small rhyme bore me"
"My category: rap-rap science.."
What y'all gon do now man?
"..that's why your small rhyme bore me"
"Your store bought rap ain't shit
Call me the specialist, professional.."
"..that's why your small rhyme bore me"
"My category: rap-rap science.."

Like this Jamaica Queens pharoah tale
How my life is parallel to them inmates
Livin inside a narrow cell
The drug lords have shootouts on carousels
I done seen it all
The average baby couldn't breathe or crawl
I was watchin fiends and whores screamin brawl
Outside of convenience stores, y'all can't stand it
Half of the fam split, we lost Tash
Keith Dolla Bill, Uncle Pook Seville, and The Bandit
My music bump, on every avenue, boulevard, and Van Wyck
I have to sell my records with a pamphlet
So y'all cats can get the spot and muscle, to find a hustle
We down to tussle, we'll clown and crush you
Mellowed out, but still a sinner down to bust you
Y'all know the code of the streets
Keep a toast when you sleep
Stick up kids be patrollin the streets
And if you fold on your peeps
Wake up slain with holes in your Jeep
Nigga what?

"..that's why your small rhyme bore me"
"Your store bought rap ain't shit
Call me the specialist, professional.."
Maintain, Ali Vegas
"..that's why your small rhyme bore me"
"My category: rap-rap science.."
Got the game sewn, get your brain blown
"..that's why your small rhyme bore me"
"Your store bought rap ain't shit
Call me the specialist, professional.."
Jamaica Queens thing y'all
"..that's why your small rhyme bore me"
"My category: rap-rap science.."Yeah
It's a new day in the rap game
This year the council taking over
Anything moving, we want in
A nick or dime is sold in the park, we want in
A song is recorded, we want in
Your album drop, we want in

[Verse 1 - Mekka Millz]
The reason why they all in a bunch and Mekka stands out
Cause most hoes suck, they stuck on the same bounce
Can't even put her in order, the gap is spaced out
[?]
Without a trick and a hat, speak true and open
By just giving em facts and tell em listen to that
Move with such emotion, you would think I had flaps
I'm that good, no pace, I stay [?]
Hoes wanna fight her cause I give em a bad look
Put it in other meaning, clap and give em a bad look
You bitches only say it, you ain't half of a half crook
That's why they all faded, cause they saying the same stuff
So I don't believe, claiming that you hard
Well, you gotta show me, and I ain't talking a scar
I wanna see you spit it, and I ain't talking a bar
Cause when the truth comes out [?]

[Verse 2 - Ali Vegas]
Uh oh, the flow's water, the words doing the breaststroke
Rap is crack, I invest in the best coke
I'm on my bike, I'll be damn if I'm left broke
I got it locked down from the east to the west coast
We ain't Grammy award winners
But if we knock off these grams we all winners
Y'all niggas is fools, you're all dinner
Mind over matter, what matters is what's on my mind, and that's money
Yes, I'm that hungry
A joke, a pill face, and a [?], I'm that funny
You wanna know how I know what I know
Just ask [?] clapped Sonny
Don't get clapped sonny, I just lost to my pride
Forced to ride if you take that from me
Just let me take my place in a circle of rap
Kick the snare til the drum pattern turn purple and black
See the world through the eyes of Saigon everything's purple and black

I know you ain't think it was over
It wouldn't be a council without Abandoned Nation
Who was y'all niggas thinking?
Ayo Saigon, where you at?

[Verse 3 - Saigon]
I said one, and here come the two to the three and four
That's before I declare war
If I declare war, you gon see some more
Like five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven
Niggas is ready to send your bitch ass to Heaven
Ali'll eat your food, that's my Dude like Devin
I'm a lyrical living legend, brethren
I run with 45 Colts but my name is not Edgerrin
Nigga, my name Brian, I live what you claim in your rhyme
Just last night I was aiming the nine
Cause some kid came in with his shine
Put the thing to his spine, now tonight I'm out claiming it's mine
You only get hoes cause you hopping out of a coupe
In prison I got more letters than alphabet soup
I used to rap with some niggas, they was hot in the booth
But they was pussy, so I kicked myself out of the group
Let's go[Verse 1]
Finally from every dimension with few restrictions
From up north to the youth detentions, I lay it down
Clear enough for who choose to listen, we all thorough
Infected by cruel intentions, but who the wise
The lies got two disguises, the surprise
Is to know when to utilize it, stay alert
The street talkers say the worst
So overall you gotta watch where you play in the dirt, it's just the rules
A killer could be just as cool, it's no image
Camouflaged right next to the
Fools, so who's who
It's the game that chooses you
A lot of shit is more easier to say than do, show and prove
Maintainers never blow they cool
Understand, every man should really know these jewels, I'm feeling live
Slim with a gorilla vibe
Away from haters cause I know what they feel inside, but never worry

[Hook]
Blowing cess in the dark (What your day about?)
Playing chess in the park (What your day about?)
Taking trips every week (What your day about?)
Spending chips on them freaks (What your day about?)
Getting money all night (What your day about?)
Betting houses on the dice (What your day about?)
Got your vest and your heat (What your day about?)
Get respect in the street (What your day about?)

[Verse 2]
Young in the mind with a old spirit
Hot blood with a heart that's so frigid, melodic music
Expressed through slow lyrics
I only spit it for the niggas that hold digits, and don't front
I know about the coke blunts and Remy nights
Got a cousin up in Elmira sending me kites
I'm felt, the ice in my ears don't melt
I could drink a whole bottle for delf and won't belch
Believe it's the same me ducking the D's
Eighty-six with the do-rag, cuff in the Lee's
Appraise this, biological' I'm ageless
Psychologically, I show amazement
Salute, been blessed with the [...?] of a coupe
Hoping the real just respect what I'm trying to produce
Quiet Money is the empire, bigger than rapping
Fuck niggas cause I been fire, that's what's that

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
From the streets to the track board
Bubble up, from the crack to the rap laws, visualize
We all uncivilized, the trained behavior
As kids taught to memorize, copy and mimic
I travel through the blocks that's dimmest
Fly nigga, use my teeth to pop the top off a Guinness, never hate
With the hunger of a heavyweight
I stay balanced in the mind when I meditate, and blow trees
Every verse is like a o-z
I know niggas in the 'hood like they know me, so no beefing
It's nothing that could stop me from eating, too in tune
Taught to heal through the doctrines and teaching, redeemed
For women I'm the man of their dreams, stand alone
When I zone nothing coming between, let's get money
The trick is to flip money, double up
Dirty or legit money, it's all the same

[Hook 2X]Yeah yeah ya'll..check it out ..yo
Betrayal of a thug, Ali Vegas...
Like you just think you down with a nigga, came up with a nigga
Flamed gats with a nigga, then all of a sudden that nigga want power
Man, he wanna take yours...

[Verse 1]
Aiyo, that cop Rico popped Tito poppin' ceelo
A hot trio, had the block locked since Eighty-Three yo
They was coppin' kilos to see dough
Took the block over when nice pulled a hiest and got life in Rio
Linked up with this lawyer Primo
Tito knew the steelo
He knew it wouldn't take much for nice to come home, other niggas was dumb
Plus when him and Nice were comin' up them other niggas was young
Yo, this ruthless chick he used to troop it wit'
She knew the script
She knew nice was only doin' a Two to Six
He came home in the same zone
Heard his Cousin got his brains blown
Now that nigga flame chrome
They stood on the block all day yo
Hustlin' llelo to see pesos
Shootin' dice with play-doh
Packin' potatoes in Tre-AO's
If you was too tired to run you fired your gun and stayed low
Pop knew it wouldn't cost a thing
For Nice to get them all assasinated cause he the boss of Queens
He could pay off a fiend, he called his Brother Ismael
Smooth killer that get ill, wit' steel
He's the one that taught Nice how to use fishscale
In '93 he caught a body, skipped bail, moved to Israel
Found a wife and crib, raised two righteous kids
Got a call from Nice, kissed his wife and slid
Cause he knew the heist was big
He put it on his Son that if this war was won
He would return home and never again draw his gun
But when it come to Fam you can't ignore the streets
The poor can't afford to sleep, the wise think before they speak

[Verse 2]
Yo, shots rang, nosy neighbors and cops came
To see who gun sling on the boulevard
Where the real will pull your card
That day it was full of trife goons with knife wounds and bullet scars
They all spit steel, Tito tried to kill Ismael
Instead the bullet ricochet'd and split the fade of Nice' Baby Brother
Slick Will
This where it gets real
Called up his Sister Allure, she gifted and raw
Swift with the Four
Matter fact Shorty quick on the draw
She the type to leave you stiff on the floor
Pray to God that you get up and start riffin' some more
But instead he called two trife dames with tight game
Gave 'em up to date photos and precise names
They spotted Tito at the dice game
Bent off of night train
They rose the chome, broke his nose bone and made moves in a white Range
Headed back to Queens
Ice picks and gats to his spleen
Just incase he tried to escape they had him tied in wires and tape that
Was drowned in Gasoline
He took it past the extreme
Where's the other half of ya team
Like Ceelo and Pop before we greet you with shots
They had Eagles and 'Wops aimed at his knot
He had no choice but to break down and start explainin' the plot
He gave 'em the drop
Pop was havin' a wedding on May Seventh
Nice and his Brother Devin would come with all types of weapons
Before they crept in the newly weds reception
They started wettin' all of his bestmen
Ceelo pushed Pop's head in
Blew a kiss to his Wife and them him and Nice fled in a Legend[Verse 1-Ali Vegas]
Yo
I was forced to live it
Other cats was brought up in it
Surrounded by drug spots, cemeteries, abortion clinics
I watch my older strong arms grow soft and timid
Until he got caught he sentenced and now he forced to been with
Up north's the sentence, I found a team to score and win with
And until this day we haven't lost a scrimmage
We floss a minute, we always know where to draw the limit
See the rich cop expensive shit to get the poor offended
My whole click related, until we situated
Seen five out the top ten that made it
Ballon'll get inflated due to diamonds and karats
The finest and fairest designed to blind the mind of a savage
Luckily I was raised by the Adriatic
That taught me how to keep my lyrics flaming crazy rapid
And still maintain an 80 average
Since Vegas was in a baby carriage
I always knew I would never sick of that train and care shit
I want to make the same impact that cocaine and crack did
What can I say I guess my moms raised me backwards
The streets ain't never offered me shit but a waiting casket
If I run I'm scared, but if I stay I'm dead

[Hook-Ali Vegas]
I'm confused
Sometimes I feel like I can't lose
Come back down to reality and tap the concrete with my shoes
I'm confused
Sometimes I feel like I can't lose
And my people keep telling me "Dog, get a grip"


[Verse 2-Ali Vegas]
We all awaiting Christ, others got money awaiting dice
Me, I had to stick with the stage and mic
My mother told me them toes that you step on today might be connected to that ass you kiss later in life
So I'ma take it like...
Throwing dice in great cracks, spending nights in state slacks
Life's a payback
I say life is a gift
They say with ever thing comes a price and a risk
Sleep was always nice with his fist and I was twice nice with the fifth
Eyes you to swift, I always wondered why the wise didn't rip
And why politicians always replace their lies with a myth
My mother always handled family ties with a twist
So I perfected my why's and my if's
So many try but they miss
When I die and I'm stiff, I want my music to be recognized more than this
I put a lot of thought in this since the days of being sent to the stores with lists
I decided rather poor or rich, Crisco is the closet I'm gone come to pouring Cris
And my rap lines is never bordemness
Just close your eyes and pick a side of the bone, I guess I got the shorter end

[Hook-Ali Vegas]
I'm confused
Sometimes I feel like I can't lose
Come back down to reality and tap the concrete with my shoes
I'm confused
Sometimes I feel like I can't lose
And my people keep telling me "Dog, get a grip"


[Verse 3-Ali Vegas]
Ayo it's hard to live where them losers crack jokes on retarded kids
And disrespectful kids get barred from the crib
Other cats stacking O's, dodging feds
God forbid I do something on earth that'll scar my kids
Lord knows my father did, starting fights in the bar with Mike
You get beat bloody with rods and pipes, just because you scar they knights
My squad will strike if the odds is right
Hundred killers with cars and bikes, hopped out on me and my moms one night
We had to flee in the lightning and rain
Now I see why Sleep smoke tress to ease and lighten the pain
As long as ideas keep enlightening the brain, and I keep writing them flames
Then I'ma be aiight in this game
Forget fighting with dames, keep it tight and my cypha won't change
Even if some judge try enditing the game
Most of y'all swift with the hands, but light in the aim

Yo I'm confused son...[Hook]
Y'all critics got a lot of nerve
Crab disease got the game muffled
A new king has emerged
I'm him to the third

[Verse 1]
Look since a young boy choking MC's with mic chords
When the night hits ball courts turn into dice boards
Got illegal two-ways instead of cell phones
Sixer fans switch to Clipper fans whenever L's home
Grew up in a foul hood, most of my childhood
A 9 to 5 couldn't get you the dough that vowels could
You know the streets brain washed me, play the game harshly
Drug dealers slang where the narks be
Make a sound to the cops and get found in the lot
Everybody come in town when you're hot
Nobody comes around when you're not
Always keep the round in the crouch
Whenever me and family decide to lounge on the block
Quick to pull it out if a clown get us hot
Seeing bullets fire from chrome, the sight of my dome
Standing on the block with dice and wireless phones
Y'all know the name, Ali Vegas and got divine right to the throne

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Ayo
Niggas know I spit dangerously
That's why wherever I go they all call me Dangerous Lee
I don't care if we chill together you ain't hanging with me
This is for all my thugs thugging, keep banging your three
All my hustlers keep clubbing slanging yo E
Six brought my first bar, eight got brains in the V
You young cats ain't got morals no more
Quick to go to war with the four
Get knocked and tell it all to the law
Whatever happened to hustling, running out product and putting in an order
For more
This how I'ma read them the new rule
I'm like Busta 9-2
Cause now I'm the leader of new school
They say I'm too young to rhyme about coke
I got a father that sniffed it
A brother that pitched it
A cousin that flipped it
And that's for all y'all critics that wanna know why the rhyming's so dope

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Look
I'm the young Prince of NY
Young, fly, sensible guy
All white T and air Ni-kes
When the temperature's hot
Old A's the only way I'm getting sent to the sky
Y'all permitted to try
But it's only one thing, if you miss it then you die
And it ain't no judge and jury, the commence'll get fired
Just my team in a tinted rented NY
Y'all heard Jada, it's a message in a bullet, Good-bye
Should have been spitting shells instead of palming your celly
It ain't no more shells, Beyonce's, and Kelly's
When lead hit yo leg, head, arm, and your belly
I know y'all say damn I'm so calm, but I'm deadly
Pull up to the prom or the telly
Hopped out the Serbians
Looking suburban, chicks swarming the Chevy
Associates is the staff of The Don
Vegas is back, but this time I ran and mastered my charm

[Hook]{verse 1}Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, All My Ghetto Children, Com'on

Even, With no type of money
We still, Gotz to make it happen
Niggas front, Then we get to scrappin
Let em' know where ur from, I'm from the ghetto

Even, With no type of money
We still, Gotz to make it happen
Niggas front, Then we get to scrappin
Let em' know where ur from, I'm from the ghetto

Let me come to explain, How life is hardly the same
In the hood the baddest kids have the godliest names
Spider webs protect a large part of my frame
My moms bought me some ganes
Now they young god is insane
We party and hang, We load the car with them thangs
See it startin to vein, And make remarkable change
And ya'll know for a fact, My flow is raw as crack
I can go on tour in back and front of corner stores and raps
Watch the crowd applaud and clap, They can't ignore this cat
I'm here to fill a void in rap, Ain't no avoidin that
Dream team give life the ????? checks
I give ya my all, Nothin less or more than that
Com'on chops, Bring the chorus back

Hook  2x

I'm from where they pop Glocks and spit snubs
Grew up next door to chop shops and strip clubs
For me life was hell, I was twice as frail
Recievin ???? from jail, I was too nice to fill and sit inside a Rikkers cell
Brothers fight after 2 nights, Imagine how lifers feel
Sittin in a place where minor few survive to tell
I give ya my best,  But still it ain't good enough
Never rep the projects, My hood was just as tough
I played basketball with,  Recovered alkaholics
Played baseball with those that sold 8 balls
Rap skills or crack skills, Whatever it take y'all
Pray to god the company dont see the roach on the wall (roach on the wall)

Hook

I've got 2 of the illest flows, Around today
So i can rap either way, Which way yall want
Check it, Look, Com'on
With all the pain and scrutiny, It's hard to maintain in 2G
We ??????????,  Police is trained to shoot me
Guess life is complicated, Wasn't the type to conversate it
Ever since my cousin Fashion in 6, Got incarcerated
One love to all my villans down for life
In the ghetto you learn to count with dykes
And run from jakes on mountain bikes
We scared on blown whites, But dont respect the housing types
We sit on crates, And watch em slowly as they grabs the light
Just as they fear it all
They send my peers up north, If the top of the ????? is off
Shed tears to get em' off
I rep for all my brothers caught in the jam
Up north in the can, I know they keep forcin your hand
Play your cards right, Ain't no more livin off the land
Then it's back to dominos, I whistle at all kinds of hoes
If rhymes was clothes, I have ill designer flows
Like hilfiger and iceberg, Da ill nigga with trife words

Hook To Fade[Verse 1]
Ayo
I know we starving in the hood
We party in the hood
Sip kool-aid and Bacardi in the hood
Only one problem in the hood
Bus trips out west, damn the kid's hardly in the hood
We move ready in the hood
We heavy in the hood
Illegal two-ways and celly's in the hood
Come thru the block bumping Nelly in the hood
Like Unduly Unduly Mami E.I
What's popping tonight
Mami looking proper and tight
Parking lot pimping, black sock on the flight
Y'all know how we do chicks in the hood
House party style yelling SWITCH in the hood
It ain't hard to get rich in the hood
No credit don't sweat it, we got Sprint in the hood
And these chicks is insane, they put they lips on the grain
No blinkers when I'm dipping thru lanes
Vegas is back, watch them start forgetting your name
Don't care about broad I pimp em the same
They keep begging me to stay 'till the morn
But it came to me like my favorite B. I. G.  song
*plays short clip of B. I. G.  song*
And if y'all know it then y'all all sing along
Get the bitch, get the pussy, get the math I'm gone

[Hook]
This is for my gangsta's and gangsta chicks
And all my gangsta cliques
It don't matter what set you claim, just respect the game
And party to this gangsta shit

[Verse 2]
When it comes to relationships, Vegas is very horrible
Let me explain a few things the young broad'll do
Promise you the universe, only give you a star or two
Once he got your mind, he don't give a shit about your heart or you
Most chicks thinks all it takes is a lie to hear
And the hottest gear, to earn their dollars here
Let me stop you there
They get comfortable, I take them on my favorite date shop and stare
Cause while I shop they watch and stare
And please don't comment on the watch my dear
I got a lot of gear
Parda down to Roc-A-Wear
Plus I dress better than most of these niggas' closet there
I could pull up to a packed strip, in a crashed whip
And still bag the baddest bad bitch
Take her to Flagship and give her X and grape goose
Hood rats say Vegas and the models say Bruce

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I had one gangsta chick, the rest was nutty
Ma if your head proper, I'll take you to Red Lobster
And let you get 45 shrimp instead of 30
Her head was nervy, I jetted on birdie
They wanna go on dates with me
Key to my empire so of course they skate with me
They wanna pay they respect to the late great with me
Kendal Jackson, in front of lakes with me
They wanna eat cheesecakes and Welches grapes with me
They wanna go half on a... and stay with me
I done shouting at hoes, cause I could talk on
East coast shake it up, West Coast get your walk on

[Hook][Verse 1-Ali Vegas]
It went down in front of Shady Trace cocaine spot
You know the one who keeps his lady laced and choke strange cops
When his brother name Square Dave rope chain dropped
He hesitated then regulated with the dessert curtailed
Accelerated up the block and celebrated
Not knowing if his victim fellow made it
The only ones who waited was me and little Donny, with the snotty nose
I guess his body froze when the Shoty rose
Papa's hoes ran up on ya man Chuck
Told him to stand up, let the whole fam struck
They impounded the tan truck, matter fact it was a blood stained Rover
The brother said his thugs ain't know ya
Pulling off yelling "It ain't over"
That's when my mind flipped
He might send some fine dipped dime chick
In a recline whip to play the crime strip
Throw the gat on her and let the nine spit
Never my room we gotta find prints
Boy is found floating in the river with his spine split
But in the mean time it may be easy cause you know how time takes

[Hook]
Ayo a gangsta's life is full of diamond rings
Pretty hoes, fast cars, and expensive things
Shoot outs, drugs, and X, and all types of schemes
In the club popping bottles with the thugs on ya team

[Verse 2-Capone]
Yo what's under the sky is foul, criminals, run down hoods
White bags traded in styles, Indian style
Me and Vegas we take paper
Wet mines, I wet yours
War with you whipping dust off
Think you hiding when I'm next door
Keep guns stashed in the Lex door
Run fast like Kearse, the ghetto cursed me
Who first to bleed?
I smoke personal, 4-4 tools
CNN news:  two slain on the Q train
I flood chains and rings
QB niggas is kings
What the night bring?
Dice games with bets out a nigga price range
Slumped fiends, looking for white thing
My money moves got advice with slang
I'm 24-hours ahead of the game, like open every hour
Niggas pushing up flower, if they would only part with a coward
Respect real,  I throw a tec to your grill

[Hook]

[Capone]
Yo dun I pop the top lock
[Ali Vegas]
Yo I kick in the door
[Capone]
I grab his bitch up
[Ali Vegas]
Yo son I grab the brick out the floor
[Capone]
Watch his mans by the window dun
[Ali Vegas]
Here I go with the mac
[Capone]
Son I got em
[Ali Vegas]
Put one in his lung and his back
[Capone]
With Giraffe on the lookout
[Ali Vegas]
And Sleep on the wheel
[Capone]
We could get away clean
[Ali Vegas]
Park the jeep on the hill
Flame biscuit and cop plan tickets to Brazil
[Capone]
We could hide the coke in sand
Wash money through Poke and his man
We wild, turn Loc on the stand
[Ali Vegas]
It was shiesty, but we had to set Mikey up
Word on the street a coke head smoked Dred and cut his wifey up
[Capone]
We might have to get Tone touched with a gem
[Ali Vegas]
Mets hat, razor tucked in the brim
Leave the truck to GM
Come back to the hood gun tucked in the Tims
[Capone]
We keep it family, never fuck with a friend
I'll body for Vegas, Vegas'll body for Pone
We got it swoon
[Ali Vegas]
Wait for the day that Guliani get body and Gotti come home*song includes Ali Vegas imitating other rappers*

(Ali Vegas - talking)
Rest In Peace to my nigga Mel, this song dedicated to you
Yeah, I sit back and I hear niggas saying "Damn, Vegas you sound like this
Nigga, you sound like that nigga"
They always compare me to greats, so a nigga can't never sound wack
Cause they compare me to every nice nigga that was ever in the  game
So I wonder what them niggas be saying

[Ali Vegas *Jay-Z*]
Gather round hustlers, that's if you still living
Black Album dropping, who's gone fill my position
Um...It's not often I lose
Who's the next king to walk in my shoes
The prince of New York, that's an awkward dude
His walk and talk is so smooth
Vegas be the talk of the news
He might just be the one
L.O. get that lil nigga on the phone
Cause I need to speak to son now

[Ali Vegas *2 Pac*]
Pistols popping at visionaries
Niggas is getting buried
Different worries, living is getting scary
Rappers rapping bout what happen
Fame and fashion, guns blasting
Bust they don't share the same passion
That's why he gone outlast em
Fasten ya seat belt, Vegas'll make a beat melt
Him against the world he don't need help
And all my niggas stuck in the pen
Ya can't deny it, he a Southsider ya don't fuck with him

[Ali Vegas *Nas*]
Back in '99 when I first heard his CD
I looked, damn an illmatic version of me
A young'n with fame thorough with game
New ruler of the borough I claim
Thoroughest lames would huddle in gangs
Thinking bout what they gone do
Vegas keep doing ya thing
Cause can't none of these young niggas fuck with you
They having a thought of spazzing in court
Half of his rock and half of his mark to the stash of New York

[Ali Vegas *Notorious B.I.G.*]
Quiet when I speak to you
La put the heat to you
Real king of New York, I'm dying in my vechicle
Like Frank White, Ali Vegas got his bank tight
Now competition can't think right
Y'all all know me, I'm the one that put the mac in roni
Top of New York like T.O.N.Y
Too many niggas tried to clone me
Truly yours, prince of New York but P.O.N.Y to you homie
You know me

[Ali Vegas *Eminem*]
Uh-oh, here we go again
First time out y'all didn't notice him
Now he gets on tracks and his roasters them
Tommy Motolla and Universal is back in control again
Casa Blanca, that's like a second home for him
50 million is a lot of dough to spend on a rapper that's going to blow  again
Who wanna go toe to toe with him?
Nobody, he squeeze triggers like Eastwood
I can't say nigga, but guess what he could

[Ali Vegas *Busta Rhymes*]
It was a cold stormy nigh chilling on Flatbush Ave
That's when my man past and pulled the CD out the stash
Said I needed to blast, I pulled over the whip before I crashed
At last, prince of New York is all in ya ass

[Ali Vegas *Ma$e*]
It be the same cats that wouldn't listen to his demo
Now want info, black on black limo
Flood any tempo, it's simple
Anything he drop hot, even if it pop like a pimple
Popo, now he loco
Raspberry no more coco
Ya know how fast an O go, if not you a doe doe
No more slow dough, sho dough
Hardcore no more go go
But y'all already know tho

[Ali Vegas *Nelly*]
Straight from the down, down
I hear dirty is getting right
Knew he was nice when I heard 'em on the mic
Girls holla'n E.I., niggas they wanna fight
Told dirty don't worry he gone be aiiight
I said his pimp juice got him feeling under the gun
Told 'em he got what it take to be number 1
When it's hot in here bitch niggas'll run
Don't worry about it they all gone be stunned

[Ali Vegas - talking *Madd Rapper*]
Naw son, Naw son, Naw son, Yo Vegas, Naw son
Ya not breaking the whole song down on these niggas
Don't let these niggas think you just doing this
Just cause you wanna sound like niggas
Word to my mother, if y'all going to compare my son
Then y'all need to compare all them niggas son
Cause all them niggas sound alike
Word to my mother from Jay to Nas, all them niggas sound alike
If you speed the nigga Jay up you get Nas
If you slow the nigga Nas down you get Pac
You take away Pac doubles, you get B.I.G
You take away B.I.G. doubles, you get Slick Rick
This is all a family tree
Y'all need to stop comparing niggas and just let niggas eat
Fuck it who knows you slow me down you might get every rapper in the  game
I might sound like the nigga Vegas when you slow me down
Try that shit out*samples Capone-N-Noreaga - Invincible from album "The Reunion"*

[Hook]
The invincible untouchable Ali Vegas y'all
You ain't...you ain't ready yet
The invincible untouchable Sleepy Eyes
You ain't...you ain't ready yet

[Ali Vegas]
Ayo it's a stick up
Y'all know how the game go
Cop the milk trucks and fuck the Range Rove
We stained those game hoes, and spit at same flows
Leave D's in they clean clothes with they brain exposed
Explain to foes that diamond is what I seek to do
My rhymes is more electrifying than Pikachu
Poke'mon, hoes stroke the don in every town
Fuck Cristal, my team sip very fine Welches grape
Before rap I delt with niggas that delt with 8's
Heavy not welter weight
We could bust gats
Y'all gotta cut crack to touch stacks
I rather bust raps
What black, y'all bust at me I bust back
Throw your middle fingers up and yell fuck that (Fuck That!)
We all know that I could drench yo crew
And Vegas and his Wolves is invincible
So what y'all want?

[Hook]

[Ali Vegas]
Ayo Vegas leave niggas sitting scared in they homes
Let a flare from the chrome that'll tear thru yo dome
My raps is more exclusives than a pair of new foams
Everybody know suicide is what I really condone
Don't want nobody in the hood swearing on tone
B.I.G. was the king of NY and I am here to heir the throne
Fuck who's the realist MC, cause I'm the livest one
Y'all Jordan, Magic, & Bird and I'm Iverson
Got no respect for the best of them
Can't be checked by the rest of them
That's why I neglected them
All drama I'm addressing them
Fuck the refs and them
I know me and team be vexin' them
They know my Wolves deserving
What happen when we start splurgin
Come thru yo block swerving in two Serbians
Back to back blue Excretions
Yeah my team need the benefit, cause we put the work in

[Hook]

[Sleepy Eyes]
Sleep is like a soldier at war, explosive and raw
Squeeze the black toaster you fall
And leave yo back broke with yo jaw
Mr. Pick Yo Lock And Open Your Door
Hit yo spot at 6 o'clock in front the grocery store
Speaking the slang loudly
Floss braids proudly with suede Ballys
Remain rowdy with guns that'll keep my brain cloudy
Bang like a gang rally as the earth is twisting
Burn the insect, liquor burned my system
Rapping was my third addiction
Never preferred to listen
Serving chickens
Living where civilians and innocent children turn to victims
Trying earn a living, I'd rather drop some words of wisdom
Took the urban rhythm, poetry mixed with journalism
Who wanna harm me?
I'm equpited enough to rip your arm piece
Squeeze, them clips breeze like leaves on plam trees
Sick with it, spit lyrics that grip spirits
Made of art, fuck a turn it to posion cause the kids hear it

[Hook][Nas samples] (Hook)
"You know it's like that, you never get the mic back
I got it hemmed, When I...When I...attack
There ain't a army that could strike back"

[Nature]
Ayo, on hot summer days I sit under AC
Slow mo, bumping Jo-Jo KC
Life shit be the theme cut, clean cut image
When me and Ali teamed up you can't fuck with us
Fuck niggas if they can't accept it
Under paid need to check in the mail every twenty days
Watching the funny ways of them record execs (executives)
Get em hog tied and thrown in the trunk for a long ride
Never let a wrong slide, two wrongs don't make a right
Fuck your whole cassette, two songs don't make you tight
Need at least eight or nine of them, possibly ten
Stay rewinding em, they pop go then you cop one again
It don't stop until your pay checks gone
Bootleggers in the street wait for Nat's next song
I stay warm, until the day that I decide to cool off
Who lost?, we be the hottest muthafuckas out of New York

[Hook (Nas samples)]

[Ali Vegas]
Ayo, I kick poetic scriptures
Fake willies get Mote off bitches
I throw up at yo sister's on my quest for riches
Put some lead through snitches
I'm from the same home the Giants, Yankees, Mets, and Knicks is
Still surviving the block, putting pies in the pot
Nature still fighting with cops
Got real niggas that'll gag your wife with a sock
Get your little mans sliced with an ox
Risk life in the box, just to get near the ice on your watch
Stay with cool intentions, fuck trials and school suspensions
Only listen to rap if the jewels ain't mentioned
They know my pen is flawless like my women
Gorgeous Kim's in George Prince
Wolves stay with chrome four-fifths
I rap professionally now
Commentators ask the specialist how...
Long it took before perfecting my style
Even with a deal I got more bills than Destiny's Child
Y'all know it's like that, so fight back
I'm reckless and wild

[Hook (Nas samples)]Ya'll know I'm young and witty, only my guns is pretty
Got Ali(Rasul)running with me, ya'll can come and get me
Find me in the slums of fifties, gutter campaigns from Poughkeepsie
That'll leave one in your kidney!
If you run against me, I've got killer flows
Ain't no monkey-business in gorilla fros
Use music to heal a soul, all my young shorties fulfill your goals
Life is more then just the fastest cars & the illest
Cloths! Tim'lands and whites, linen with ice
Winning with dice, cinnamon wife blend with the trife!
Repenting to Christ, vacating where the temperature's nice
Penderin' twice, that's what I call: Living the Life..

Chorus:
Yo it's the same hood money guns bottles of Cane
We can take what tomorrow'll bring
But as the days pass, our mottos'll change..
It's all one world, divided by bars and the chains, sorrow & pain
Follow the game gospels came with bullets ans slugs
Took it to bloods of Abraham's crooks and them thugs
Hookers in clubs, little girls cooking up drugs
Who am I to rearrange their outlooks of love?!
My footage on dubs is like Holy Books from above

Saying Allah U Akbar, still shook from his grudge
Shook to be judged, balls of fire false desire
Crawling up higher until my laws retire
Yo, cutting no slacks, busting no caps
We've learned to reevaluate and muscle our tracks
My lungse'll colapse cause I keep cussin' on wax
How many rappers do you know still hustling crack?

Chorus: Repeat

Now they're really gonna hate us! The Square and Ali Vegas
Makin' papers. You can't escape the vapors
If the music doesn't work go back to stagin' capers
It ain't our fault they say it's what the devil made us
Whether mikes or skypagers, gats or crossfaders
The game's the same and it's played by all ages
Laced with raw flavas, make ya'll wanna taste it
Niggas throw your guns in the air, hoes get naked
Our motto. Pop bottles after we shake it
The lifestyles of young brothas tryin' to make it
Whips, exotic trips, and large bank statements
It's yours and it's there to be taken(Yo) Queens got shit on lock
Wipe your feet when you step in my house (Queens nigga)
Queens got shit on lock (Ali Vegas) (no doubt watch yo mouth)
*Repeat

Yo Ali where you from, I'm from Jamaica, Queens
Where they beat you up and take your jeans
Most of them kids'll put a toast in your ribs, if you make a scene
For the grace of green, fakes and fiends
Can't wait to meet and scheme on ways to erase your team
Only my fam and God knows how much I damage y'all flows
A live vet, die tech reference from camouflage foes
On tough nights I let my heat fire
Shorty stoned scuff nights over the street wire
He said this work'll be deranging, stressing
I had to sit him down and explain the lesson
I told him never change direction, just maintain perfection
Cause every time you lose faith your foes gain a blessing
Now Ali'll catch reck against your best vets
On cold nights I rest fresh techs inside of Guess sweats
For them killers sending death threats
A young Queens nigga getting money
So y'all think people make decisions for me

Chorus

Yo in the summer time beats bang
Police blame street gangs that speak slang when the heat flames
Stick up kids (??) when it's nice out, people with ice out
Queens niggas build build on facts and escape through precise routes
A bunch of shot landers, running from that supercop Amanda
Nobody can't stand her
In '94, the grimmey whore got my family
Shipped me down to Atlanta
I came back the streets praised me
Now I raise guns on killers who raised me
To all you teens rushing through, I'm crushing you
I ain't huggable or lovable, I'm just a young Queens nigga that's untouchable
But still I get shown lots of love
We never borrowed coats, we had to double coats and wear socks as gloves
In fights and scuffles you get temporarily scarred with a knife
But in a struggle you get mentally scarred for life (what)

Chorus

I share brief conversations with my street congregation
Before I meet with either God or Satan
I flee of conflagration
In fatigues and walibees Ali's the prodigy
Who flow futuristic like Nostradamus prophecies
Knowledge equality, now it hurts my pops to see
The most greatest prophets acknowledge me for street survival
My Queens Odyssey never repeat the Bible
We cock and squeeze when we meet with rivals, Police is trife too
Rules give me beats to write to
Ali's the pharoah summoned by the most prolific gods that comes complete to cycle
Now things are starting to get more drastic
The Bronx mothered hip-hop but Queens fathered this rap shit
(What?!)

Chorus til fade
