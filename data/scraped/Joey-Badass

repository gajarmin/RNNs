[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Feeling like a vigilante or a missionary
Tell my A$AP killers get they pistols ready
Send 'em to the cemetary with obituaries
Don't be scared, nigga, is you ready?
I've been thinking 'bout all the O's in my bank account (What?)
X the hoes in my bed is 'round the same amount (What?)
Ever since this new star fame came about
Or ever since me and Drizzy started hangin' out
Young boy, let his gun bang, let his nuts hang
Transition to a Lamborghini from a Mustang
Drugs slang in the drug game with the hustling
(I know one thing) Anything is better than that 1 Train
Bag made of Goyard, cheffin' like I'm Boyar-
Dee, probably selling D in your local courtyard
Braids like I'm O-Dog, my la familia go hard
Down to my inlaws, they outlaws with no laws

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
We outlawed then I bogart, any pros that got 'proached at
With a toe-tag, get broke off, in the projects with a skateboard
I roll past and I blaze y'all like, "DOO DOO!" I hate y'all
When the beef cooked, I ate y'all like, "Mmm mmm,"
Let's play ball in a ballpark with all sharks and a blindfold
I rhyme cold, my K hot, your 9 cold, that bark like K9's on
That banana clip, straight from the rip
I'll make that shirt say RIP, I'm on some shit
If I'm not the hottest then Hell must've froze over
You thought it was safe then forgot what the code was
I carry traits of a traumatized soldier
Don't look in my face, I might snap, I might choke ya
Spine right out of place, give me dap like you 'posed ta
Darts at your posters, dark nights like this
I metamorph like I'm 'posed ta, I might slice my wrist
Or pretend like a vulture and drop off this cliff

[Verse 3: Joey Bada$$]
Barely even conscious, talking to my conscience
Gettin' deeper in these flows like conches
I'm on my convict, don't drop bars, I drop prisons
Don't sell rocks, seen the spectrum through the prisms
Somehow bypassed the bias and the -isms
The violence and the killin', so given
They seen my pigment and thought that was the ign'ance
Unfortunately I am not that type of niglet
But pass the pot, let me skillet
Just got back to the block from a 6 o'clock with Jigga
And I'm thinkin' 'bout signin' to the Roc
But my niggas on the block still assigned to the rocks
And I swear it hurt me soul
I try to prevail, but when I preach it only hurt their sales
Like you're only gon' end up either dead or in jail
But you my nigga, wish you the best for real

[Verse 4: Yelawolf]
When you mention my name amongst other white rappers
Or for that matter, any fuckin' rapper, fuck it
Painter, skater, musician, trailer park dirt ditch diggin'
Burger flippin', eat, sleep, shittin' human bein', you would be in
Trouble to body double or couple me to these others
Cause comparatively speakin', my reach is beyond the bubble
That they put me in, my vision's beyond the Hubble's
I huddle with Nubians, new beginning again
You in school at 10, late, Radioactive's goin' gold
And so? GREAT. Do I give a flying duck
If I'm applyin' love to my rhymin' plus alignin' us?
Alabama's climbin' up, wait, no I don't give a
Flying duck, nothing but a buckshot, Ch, pow!
Motherfuck your life, pussy blood clot
Ain't never been no rapper this cold since 2Pac was froze
And thawed out for a spot date at a Coachella show, Yelawolf

[Verse 5: Danny Brown]
Weed a different color like a hoodrat bra and panties
And my flow be overhead like pots and pans in pantries
Antsy cause I'm high like Michael Jackson penny loafers
Moonwalkin' on the sun, barefoot, with shades on
Bitch pussy smell like a penguin
Wouldn't hit that shit with my worst enemy's penis
Bitch when I say this I mean this: Ho, I'm the meanest
Dick so big, stretch from Earth to Venus
That molly got me nauseous, aw shit, no off switch
Lawless, obnoxious, on that "suck my cock" shit
That is my synopsis, ostrich posh shit
Hoes on some goth shit, stop it! You not this!
Novice, regardless, heartless and awkward
Cryin' tears of vodka prima donna at the concert
Adonis smokin' chronic 'bout to vomit gin and tonic
Just bein' honest, tell me, isn't that ironic?

[Verse 6: Action Bronson]
Swiftly, I shift the Bimmer 860
A heavy smoker so you know I brought the Blake with me
The moon’s reflection off the lake hit me
You should've stayed with me, now many Asian bitches lay with me
The face is silky like a tablecloth
My shorty gallop in the morning on the beach like a Chilean horse
Red roses dropped from boxes very often
Confetti torchin', drinking Henny like I'm Kenny Lofton
Outstandin'
I fixed the game between Georgia Southern and Gramblin'
You see us scrambling, selling Susan Sarandon
The cloud of smoke like the phantom
Damn this shit tastes like fantastic
You see me comin' through in each state
Just so the lord could put the fork inside the cheesecake
Cuffed to my wrist, I’ve got the briefcase
The gavel slam, I’m a free man, try not to eat ham

[Verse 7: Big KRIT]
Big KRIT, shawty
Spit like my last breath: casket rap, six deep
Eyes closed, the black is back, out come the 'Lac with flats
After that, bottles I can’t pronounce, like, “How you ask for that?”
Why you ask for crack and all you had was scratch?
All I had was rap, when all they had was wack
All I wanted was love, all they had was dap
Fuck them haters and fuck them hoes, a championship win is
The aftermath, ask LeBron, open palm slap a bitch
Walk the plank or break a bank, I’ve been in the business of sinkin' ships
Chokin' niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with
Resuscitations cost the label, I’m taxing if you want a hit
Clear, fuck your career, bitch, I was born here
Been a killer, '86er, nigga, that's my born year
Get the fuck from 'round here, that's just my country ways
Suckin' on your momma's titty, bitchin' while I was choppin' blade
Grippin’ grain, fuckin' hoes, candy paint like Everglades
Miss me with that rapper chatter, take that shit up with my bass
I put that on my sub, how could you ever doubt me?
Most rappers hoping the world end so they won't have to drop another album
B.B. King saw the king in me, so why can't you?
In order to come up close, you’ll have to dig up Cash and Elvis, too
(That wasn't no sample nigga!)
Muddy water flow, Dixie rebel past
Fuck your Louis flag, popping benji tags on your wifey’s ass
That’s out of line, but in living color?
I’m more like Miya Bailey on you rap motherfuckers, a true artist[Produced by DJ Premier]

[Intro: DJ Premier cuts]
Money ain't a thing if I got it (x2)

[Hook]
Before the money, there was love
But before the money, it was tough
Then came the money through a plug
It's a shame this ain't enough

[Verse 1]
Yo, sitting back plotting, jotting information on my nation
Really started from the bottom, boy cotton
But they still planting plantations, we keep buying in
Closed-minded men
Pride is higher than the prices on your Pradas and
Balenciagas, balance my saga with the henny aqua
Me and my niggas tryna eat, you pussies empanada
The flow like plenty lava
With just a penny I could multiply my worth
And make you work for me for twenty hours
I swear these niggas love to copy, thanks for listening
This kid ain't been the same
Since Biggie smacked me at my christening
Watch what you dishing and please play it safe
Cause your position on the top is switching right in front your face
Rock you outta space with rhymes, I'm bustin' out
Keep ducking down, got some missiles now, headed for your house
So put the pistols down, got that red dot on your nose
Who put the clown I lock, jaws like a blue nose, foes
Keep your mouth closed or you can see the solar
I got connections that guaranteed to see closed doors
You hear that underground sonar
The way I flows then switch them
The Pros been on a mission
Listen enter the chamber, get hyperbolic
They raisin' Macs, I raise steaks to keep them brolic
My visions is macrocosmic, pass the chronic
The mastered sonics is light years above your conscious
You're novice, but I got notes that strike nerves
I promise your minds ain't sharp like my swords
So cut the BS, and don't worry where my jeans is
And PS: Your bitch a genius, learned from my penis
I got dreams selling arenas and breaking brackets
Tenants racket, while I'm cracking a Serena
God damn, God bless the heaven that sent you
But now I'm breezing out, baby, cause my rent's due

[Verse 2 (DJ Premier cuts)]
Shit is really real out here
I said shit is really real out here (It ain't  easy)
Just trying to get a deal out here
(Money ain't a thing if I got it)
Yo, I'm screaming cream
Who fucking with the rap supreme?
Joey Bad and Big Preem came to collect the green
I got a dollar and a dream, know what I mean?
And I gotta get my mama off the scene (x2)
(Joey Badass) cause
Cash ruined everything around me (x3)
(Won’t sign to no major if no wager) (money ain't a thing)
They say money is the root of all evil
I see money as the route of all people
Cause we all follow paper trails, paper trails
And everybody gotta pay their bills, pay their bills (x2)
(It ain't easy)
It's the dollar dollar bill, y'all
It's the dollar dollar bill, it's the dollar bill that kills, y'all (x4)

[Hook][Produced By: Basquiat]

[Intro]
Mother, mothersucker, yeah, oh, this is what you want, huh?
Microphone checker, yo, yo, yo

[Verse]
Uh, motherfuckin' microphone checker
Keep that grip tight, like my Smith & Wesson
Ike with the mic, which nigga tryna turn up?
Hit you with the hurtful fuckin' truth, like Sojourner
Motherfuckin' microphone eater
Spittin' hot shit, hit ya dome with the heater
Wouldn't want to be ya, dish lyrical fajitas
Got dragon balls, like my name was Vegeta
Motherfuckin' super duper swankin'
Niggas still hatin', pigs want him for the bacon
Take 'em to the slaughterhouse, say we 'bout to order out
Tell 'em we the badass motherfuckers that they heard about
Yes, I guess the word is out, we comin' for the top dollar
Top rottweiler, since I popped my collar
Niggas say they hit us, they ain't ever shot nada
Me? I'd rather not snitch up on my own problems
Cause I'm a microphone killer
Especially when my head is gone off the liquor
Specially educated, heavily medicated
Give me that beat and I'll put you next to Dilla, my nigga
Flow sweeter than vanilla
Tell these haters beat it, can't Jackson thriller
I'm the nigga that you see when you're in the mirror
Say my name five times, this what I deliver

[Hook]
This a motherfuckin' nuke that I'm droppin'
The world in my pocket, kick you out your continent
Always drop hot shit, Toroidal Flow keep constant
And I won't stop 'til I reach Christ Conscious, nigga

[Bridge]
Which one of y'all niggas really want it with me?
None of y'all niggas, fuck outta here
Beast coast, nigga, Pro Era in your area

[Hook]

[Outro]
Niggas know, niggas, niggas, niggas know[Produced by J Dilla & The Roots]

[Intro: Joey Bada$$]
One time, what's the word
What's the word, what's the word
Yo yo yo yo yo, yo yo
Turn me up on the headphones
Two times, twist the herb
Twist the herb, twist the herb
Yo yo yo yo yo, yo

[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
If looks could kill I let the swank drill like a deadly weapon
I drop bombs on an enemy at any second
Look at me wrong I turn you to tomb stones
Lock you in the crosshairs and you gone, then I throw my deuce up
Sip sangritas with your señorita, like me gusta
See what that early morning cock will do up to your rooster
I bet my cockiness will boost her confidence
Then  you gon' wonder where your highness went

[Refrain 1: Joey Bada$$ & BJ The Chicago Kid]
I bet she get low for a nigga like me
She get low for a nigga like me
I bet she get low for a nigga like me
Low for a nigga like me

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
So we burn the mary jane til' the third degree
Some niggas bitin' flows yo, that's burglary
Same niggas actin' like they never heard of me
A fuck nigga could get clocked, yo that's word to me

[Refrain 2: Joey Bada$$ & BJ The Chicago Kid]
He get blown for a nigga like me
Get his head exposed for a nigga like me
Put him on the floor for a nigga like me

[Verse 3: Joey Bada$$]
My mind boggles when time toggles
In the ocean of stars it's hard to find goggles, we twisted up
So we put it in the air
Don't let the j's start unravelling
We gettin' blown like a javelin
She throw it back like she time travelin'
Rocked the boat so well, she jumped out and started paddling
I'm screaming "Land, ho!" 'bout to hit for sure
I motorboat it slow then I ripped the flow
I'm pretty sure-like nice beaches-that
Even at my weakest I still leave 'em speechless
How you like those peaches?
Find me rotting the apple
'Bout to bump so plump, 'bout to lock in the grapple
Feeling like the highest man about to tackle
Facts like the tat under the cap of the Snapple
Cats get decapitated for actin' a fool
Blacks get their ass sprayed just for makin' a move

[Refrain 3: Joey Bada$$ & BJ The Chicago Kid]
We get high and say "fuck the police"
That’s why we get high and say "fuck the police"
That’s why we get high and say "fuck the police"

[Verse 4: Joey Bada$$]
Cause every time I make a move they be sweatin' me
They want another black man in penitentiary
It's even hard for that man standing next to me
Cause he could catch a bullet that was really meant for me
It's like every step bring me close to destiny
And every breath I get closer to the death of me
I'm just tryna carry out my own legacy
But the place I call home ain't lettin' me

[Refrain 4: Joey Bada$$]
You can't get by if you don't respect an OG
You can't get by if you don't respect an OG
You can't get by if you don't respect an OG

[Verse 5: Joey Bada$$]
Cause every corner I turn a nigga testing me
And every morning I mourn just for the less of me
Sometimes I ask the Lord why he be blessing me
And not my brothers whose souls now rest in peace

[Refrain 5: Joey Bada$$ & BJ The Chicago Kid]
I pray there's hope for a nigga like me
Hope for a nigga like me
Just pray there's hope for a nigga like me

[Verse 6: Joey Bada$$]
I'm something like the chairman of the board, rantin'
I feel invincible like McMannon
One of the last original emcees that's left standing on the planet
Strike like a meteor, do remedial damage, damnit
Cats can't stand it, get they ass handed and branded
By the lyrical New York City bandit
True Warrior like Rembrandt
Yo some cats claim they fly but really been landed
I really can't stand it
Let me take a seat, this where Rosa Parks her bum, now
Make some room for me
PE in your beeper, hun you can read it and weep
My old hoes call me now, leave a message after the beep
I don't wanna speak no I don't wanna speak
I don't wanna speak no I don't wanna speak
I just wanna beat, girl, I just wanna beat
I just wanna be free

[Refrain 5][Produced by Vin Skully]

[Intro]
It's either, them or you
It's sort of like, survival you know. Survival of the fittest you know
You do what you do to stay alive

[Verse 1: Joey]
Niggas don't want war I'm a martian with an army of spartans
Sparring with a knife in a missile fight
Get your intel right, your intelligence is irrelevant
But it's definite I spit more than speech impediments
Brooklyn's the residence, the best and it's evident
We got them niggas P-E-Nuts, like they elephants
Throw 'em in a trunk if they hate though
We don't give a fuck as long as we collect our pay, so
Ya'll collect pesos, ya money ain't right here
I got them girls next to the wood like they light year, I'm right chea
Tryna get a buzz, tryna pollinate
STEEZ got that presidential shit out to inaugurate
My P.E conglomerates bout to P-E-E on any wanna B-E, weak MC
Air 'em out or leave 'em empty congratulate the semi-auto
Fire flame spitter like komodo
No time for fake people, they be simmin' like Kimora
I'm the empor-ah in search of the adora, my heart go
Ba boom Ba boom Ba boom boom
It's panic like Dora when shots blast
See I was raised that way, I'm from the place where they raise that K
Like every day in every way and every where you go, just ain't safe
The only thing that I can say, to you is pray
Cause when niggas start equippin', and throw the clip in
Your blood drippin', and got you slippin'
Another victim, don't know whats hit them – through his spinal
Just another man who defeated by survival
That's your biggest rival, in your whole life
These bars you can't handle you better hold tight
They sayin' I'm the best, I'm like you're so right
Still ain't got enough shine to last the whole night, nigga

[Interlude]
Yo, fuck the police nigga
Fuck every ass corrupt politician on Wall Street
P.E, Public Enemy, Assassinate us, bitch
Fuck that, fuck everything son
Fuck government, Fuck, listenin' and shit

You want fuckin' energy? Dickheads

[Verse 2: Capital STEEZ]
It's like 6 milli ways to die my nigga choose one
Doomsday comin' start investin' in a few guns
New gats, booby traps, and bazooka straps
Better play your cards right, no booster packs
Everybody claim they used to rap
But these ain't even punchlines no more, I'm abusing tracks
Leaving instrumentals blue and black
I'm in Marty McFly mode, so tell em' that the future's back
Riding on hoverboards, wiping out motherboards
Stopped spitting fire cause my motherfuckin lung is scorched
King Arthur when he swung his sword
A king author I ain't even use a pen in like a month or four
I had a hard time writing lyrics
Now I'm way over heads, science fiction
You can try and get it, my man the flyest with it
With a mind of fine of interest for your finest interests
They say hard work pays off
Well tell the Based God don't quit his day job
Cause P.E's about to take off
With protons and electrons homie that's an A-bomb
Fuckin' ridiculous
Finger to the president screamin' "fuck censorship!"
If Obama got that president election
Then them P.E. boys bout to make an intervention
Fuck what I once said, I want the blood shed
Cause now-a-days for respect you gotta pump lead
I guess Columbine was listenin' to Chaka Khan
And Pokémon wasn't gettin' recognized at Comic-Con
It's like we've been content with losin'
And half our students fallen victim to the institution
Jobs are scarce since the Scientific Revolution
And little kids are shootin' Uzi's cause its given to 'em
Little weapon, code name: Smith and Wesson
And you'll be quick to catch a bullet like an interception
If your man’s tryna disrespect it
Send a message and it's over in a millisecond - nigga[Intro]
Will I see you through my Hazeus View?
Will I see you through my Hazeus View?
Will I see you through my Hazeus
My Hazeus, my Hazeus , my Hazeus, my Hazeus view?

[Verse 1]
You ain't running with the apes yet
Apex at the empire state neck
Hand no crown, my niggas take that
In this state of mind, gotta state facts suspect nigga
Get your wig pushed back tonight, to 1999
Who'd've thought that 19 I might be in my prime
Thought of the right scheme everything else align
Here's a penny for your thoughts another one another one
Eventually the dream was bought
Now that's a real, real, real mind fuck
Might fuck up your mind if you're lighting up
Make sure the ting is tight enough
If you tough - Imma titan, like Zeus I enlighten them
Kick flows, till it's kung-fu fighting them
Is it him, it is you who was nice as him?
I don't see nobody no, no
I don't see nobody no, no

[Hook x2]
And we probably share a trait or two
But I can't see what I can't relate to
Hey Jesus will I ever get to see you through my Hazeus View?

[Verse 2]
You rap niggas ain't safe yet
I keep the bombs in my basement
When I detonate you can feel the vibrations
I got your mind shaking, am I right?
My light gon spark for generations
One day my voice will be heard on every radio station
Cause fake to real ratio changing and it's
Everyday living in this life I see
That in every way they wanna see my life decease
But I survive the question is for how long
Since my homie died, I been tryin to hold on
The happy days of my life is now all gone
But I cope with that weed I smoke and writing these songs
But it's should I stay should I go? Oh!
Should I stay should I go? Oh!
I don't know, I don't know
Lord please let me know

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Every thing cool like in the state of mind
That this state of mine correct, cool, calm, collect
Deflect the corrupt with intellect
I talk too much, the jig is up he has risen up
From a division of most kings
With their vision, positioned for precision
It's mind splittin' and soul upliftin'
But still feel so trapped in the solar system

[Hook][Produced by Freddie Joachim]

[Intro: Joey Bada$$]
Momma I just booked a first class ticket to my destiny by the way
Yeah

[Bridge: Maverick Sabre]
Maybe I'mma fly away
Maybe I'mma fly away, some day

[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
So gullible just like my first love
Stay humble, but I knew that I was first up
Picked up the pen, and that's when I drew my first blood
Spill my heart again, cause the pain'll never end
Happiness is temporary, always has been
I just lost one, but sometimes I win
I always spread love, but sometimes I sin
I only trust some, that’s why I keep a few friends
Funny cause I used to see my circle never end
Always kept like 47 friends in my circumference
All that’s left now is the radius
They still here, trying to find love on this atmosphere
Things get severe for everybody, everywhere
This is my moment of truth, right here
Swear I ain’t scared of no man
I see the omens
I pick 'em up and keep it rollin'
The omnipresence is omnipotent
But I keep going, 'til it’s all said and done
I show all my soul purpose but I’m pretty sure there's one
There’s a reason why I’ve come, new season's just begun
This the death of a psychopomp but a birth of God's son

[Hook: Joey Bada$$]
Don’t mourn me when I’m gone, celebrate my travels
Whenever you need me, just take a plane to the astral zone
I’m headed home, I’ve been hurting too long
Time don’t stand still, so you gotta move on

On & On & On & On & On & On & On & On & On & On & On & On & On & On & On & On & On & On & On

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
I had a dream I seen my name on the gravel stone
And read here lies a G followed by a poem
I couldn't see the words but I'm sure what's in his own
Funny that I write most when I know my feeling's wrong
With both shoulders that my head is always on
I trudge through harm's way with heavy boulders on my arm
I feel strong as I walk through the many storms that
Rain on my parade, seen the dust cry for days
I'm feeling like a young prince, I'm drinking today
My name ring bells all the way to heaven's gate
Though STEEZy told about me, yo I know he always watching
I guess there really is a heaven for us hip hoppers
I really miss my partner
But I know he with Big Poppa, 2 Pacs, and the big L rolled proper
And that's a big pun, know that I'mma join him
When my time come, but the story just begun, so

[Hook: Joey Bada$$]

[Bridge 2: Maverick Sabre]
One day I'mma fly away
One day I'mma fly away (Fly away, fly away)
One day you will fly away (Fly away, fly away)
One day we will fly away (Fly away, fly away)

[Verse 3: Dyemond Lewis]
My clouds grey, I hope my pain don’t show
Looking in the sky I wonder where them rainbows go
They say that if we reign, them pot-of-gold’s will show
Even skating down the block don’t feel the same no more
If I ain’t looking, I still see it all
My vision’s jaded, too much bitches rubbed the crystal balls
They stay scheming, y’all like the sheep to the shepherd
The trees to the leaves, you needed but not needed
So I work alone, lone wolf, stay creeping
I'd rather hunt on my own then be owned and not eating
I’m not eatin’, not blamin’, I’m just sayin’
Go to bed with hunger pains while these other niggas caking, they too fake
No rappers rapping for years waiting 'round for that big break
Break a arm, break a bond before I go break the bank
Break a hundred, that's fifty-fifty
As long as Raw eatin' wit me
Seen different cities, different titties, all with no money with me
I'm on my grind man, no regrets when I die man
'Til we fly man, 'til we fly man, 'til we fly man
You gon' miss us when we fly man

[Hook: Joey Bada$$ + Bridge: Maverick Sabre][Verse 1: Joey BADA$$]

One, two, three, four
I said it's one, two, three, four
I got one, two, three whores
And they all gotta fuck me tonight
Show you what's it's like, pass me your life
Pass me the mic so I can free my mind, so I can free my soul, so I can free my spirit
But these niggas won't hear it, talkin' 'bout I am at the top of the pyramid with a pair of mids

[Verse 2: Kirk Knight]

Like, "My nigga I ain't hear it"
Let me spit bars for some clearance
Clearin' up my mind and my chakaras just fine
And my way through this life and it's
Yo, hold up
Chillin' in the bed for a minute
Fuck every girl cause you know I'm always in it
Now a nigga hittin' all that type of shit that a nigga was tryin' to live in this past life, like

[Verse 3: Joey BADA$$]

Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
Lethal lyrics, see through your heart and I see your spirit
Said these niggas don't get my drift
They can't drive with me, can't get this shit
Said they can't keep up smoking reefer, that's what my teacher said
I would never be cool
Y'all went to high school, I went to school high
Still gettin' with the cool life

[Verse 4: Kirk Knight]

And um, I'm high again
Hi again, you can bring a friend
I said super duper maniacal snooper
Man with the king jeweler, what a stooper
Man with the bada bling, came with the ???
Everybody said that he look like King Koopa
And if I keep rappin' bars kinda super, everybody said that Kirk is super
Now a nigga got bars for a minute
It don't really matter cause a nigga been in it
Incarcerated bars, killin' the ???
It don't really matter cause a nigga was just in it

[Verse 5: Joey BADA$$]

Incarcerated stars
All I do is plan to go far
So all really do is work hard, spit these bars
Don't really bathe so he got no bars[Verse 1: Dirty Sanchez]
Dirty Sanchez, and I got dirty presidents
Tell your bitch that we at the back door kicking it
Mix the light of hash with the spliff in it
My lungs are blacker than licorice so they match with my timberlands
Missy didn't hit the L yet but, I'm super duper fly man
Aviators on no helmet
Capital STEEZ helped us formulate a team
Now it's cool all week, 45 to 47 degrees
Fuck school though, them hoes scoot over
95 maxima the new range rovers
It feels like we space traveling
With a eighth and lava lamp, niggas just wishing we'd throw the towel in
Tiedye mental now kill the game we bound to win
Crown and caged we proceed yall pre-game
All our proceeds are sprouting now we reigning
Dirty motherfucker this game what we staining

[Hook: Dirty Sanchez]
And you don't stop it's still 147 on an undercover cop
And you don't stop it's still 147 on an undercover cop

[Verse 2: Rokamouth]
From an AK get em to a motherfucking cop
Fuck is they repping for trying to lock me up for pot
It's too bad that these bullets ain't gon make you niggas stop
Cause the way that they be watching if these faggots want the cock
Why they plot on a nigga? Guess they think I'm selling rock
Cause my knots grown bigger, I'm saving for the top
Just to drop ya'll quicker, fuck what you heard beast coast gon get ya
And when we come get ya bring ya spot on the stretcher
I'm a real hot stepper fighting hard for this cheddar
And only getting better do this shit in any weather
And if you really clever watch your head for your head get severed

[Hook: Rokamouth]

[Verse 3: A La $ole]
As I walk through the streets in the alleys of Brooklyn
Feins is on a scheme mad cops is crookin' you shooken
Just look kid, this ain't your average playground
Bodides in the garbage so them niggas never play round
Just stay down, cause stray bullets might leave your face looking
Destructed, young ruckus can't touch this
Fake MC's, get the ham and no bluffing
They say the kids ill, no I'm fucking disgusting
The bucket brim low, the all black timbos
Wear the lumberjack got a Brooklyn mental
We fresher than mentos, you cats is all weak
Spending heat on momentum never stand on our feet
Each stanza I demand these answers in my hand
Ready for fortune and my times are for grand
Just understand God these streets is murderous
I know you heard of us, you ain't hurting us
It's looking worse for ya, we need a hearse for ya
Better quit while you're ahead or get murked in a
New York minute you'll get smoked like you Newport living
They want beef but MC's only be grillin'

[Hook: A La $ole]

[Verse 4: Joey BADA$$]
Puff puff, pass the dutchy to the righteous man
Heights expand, what we like the contraband
Hit the road with a conscious band
Flow rugged raw shit and
Filled with intoxicants
So the groupie girls pop lock it in
Drop it like it's hotter than tropic land
Tropacan in a can, Cancun on a can am, Dee got the cam
Found yo ex on the beach, yo call me the sandman
Got the queen of dancehall on a handstand
Don't worry bout what car I be in it got your BM in it
Dark tinted, so you can't see him in it
Sharp splinters, told him it'll be a minute
Of blood stains thicker than wood grain
Thinking they would gain but your hood blamed
Production of your environmental conception
Wishin' you was let into which you was not let in
Flourishing through flows that let you hours
True coffee flowers for hours
True MC's they move beef with cowards
Me and Powers discovered our powers when we hit the sours
Word to my brother STEEZ, I pack with the loudest so much green
When we hit spliffs it's like we hit the lotto
That's the lotto cause "Life's a bitch" is still a motto
But that ain't the only reason we get high tho

[Hook: Joey BADA$$]

[Outro]
"Local Hip Hop Group Pro Era 47 insists that they do not spray this graffiti around the neighbourhood, but they do say they designed the image and that is the number 47, they say it's meant to represent peace and balance."[Pre-Hook]
Wake up early, trapping late
Serving niggas by the gates
Shooting dice I let em' skate
Six and eight, they running mates
Getting money imma bag that
These bitches they can wait

[Hook]
Gave my worker's 4 pounds told 'em bring me 98
Matching Fubu with the Bape that was back in 98'
20 dollars for the drank, that was back in 98'
Starchy jeans and screw tapes, that was back in 98'
Gotta hundred round drum, hit your ass wtih 98'

[Verse 1: Maxo Kream]
Blowing O Dog, Like Larenz Tate
Running your mouth like Crest Colgate
Run in your house if I want I'm a take
Take everything but the sink and fishtank
My dick ain't free, I'm a make a bitch pay
Shoot a nigga up with the Mac 90k
Nintendo 64, we don't play 2k
Prank call phone, rollin' two-ways
25 lighters, gotta pocket full of stone
Don't call my phone, if you're not a yellow-bone
I'm an H-town nigga, so I need extra dome
Keep a duece of the screw, double cup, styrofoam
Drop a lot of Molly, cause I get it by the key
For the sherm heads got the PCP
My boys goin' pop I ain't talkin' Backstreet
My guns goin' pop and the bullets "in sync"
Stay comin' down, always Po'd up, Blowing Orange OJ
Oh Say Bronc-o, Drop a four and a bar in a p. of soda..
Jumping on a grey(?) take, got me screwed up
Round 98 I was sippin an 8
Bad Indian bitch I was in the second grade
Had a southside fade with four ways
Running outside fucking up my new J's
Right around the same time, I done saw my first bike
Sitting on the porch chillin' in the front  yard
Goin' hard or goin' home, everyday had to fight
Woop a niggas ass for some Poke'mon cards
WWF X PAC went hard
Running round school telling my teacher to suck-it
Momma used to woop my ass real hard
Act a damn fool when I'm out in public

[Pre-Hook]
Wake up early, trapping late
Serving niggas by the gates
Shooting dice I let em' skate
Six and eight, they running mates
Getting money imma bag that
These bitches they can wait
(Hook):
Gave my worker's 4 pounds told 'em bring me 98
Matching Fubu with the Bape that was back in 98'
20 dollars for the drank, that was back in 98'
Starchy jeans and screw tapes, that was back in 98'
Gotta hundred round drum, hit your ass wtih 98'

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
Over bad cop, and this ragtop
Fuck a good cop, I've never met one
Stay tipsy like J-Kwon, make the hood hop
I drop napalms
Stay calm I drop 8 bombs
But you feel that thump when that bass goin'
Every past sales we face thump, get so high, nigga face numb
My time money, I never waste none, shine coming don't get sonned
The stakes are high,I got three supplies
Grill motherfucker till he well done
Get deep Fried, they sat Louis, know my nigga Lex stay with the toolie
Flip a nigga ta-rantualas, turn rat niggas to ratatouille
Crook a nigga, know I had to do it
New-York back, you know I had to prove it
Money is my slang, nigga, y'all niggas don't speak it fluent
Fact y'all niggas can't speak at all
One more word I'm a fucking lose it
Got a king size bed, don't sleep at all
So when your queen give it up, get the pussy bruised
Oh My, mouths stayed glued to my dick and balls
I bust her jaw. Until it hit the door
But don't trip nigga, it's still yours
Soon as I get to score, that's when you get the call
It's like a chain reaction, you fuck up, she back for more

[Pre- Hook]
[Hook]

[Outro Loop][Produced by Hit-Boy]

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Feeling like a vigilante or a missionary
Tell my A$AP killers get they pistols ready
Send 'em to the cemetary with obituaries
Don't be scared, nigga, is you ready?
I've been thinking 'bout all the O's in my bank account (What?)
X the hoes in my bed is 'round the same amount (What?)
Ever since this new star fame came about
Or ever since me and Drizzy started hangin' out
Young boy, let his gun bang, let his nuts hang
Transition to a Lamborghini from a Mustang
Drugs slang in the drug game with the hustling
(I know one thing) Anything is better than that 1 Train
Bag made of Goyard, cheffin' like I'm Boyar-
Dee, probably selling D in your local courtyard
Braids like I'm O-Dog, my la familia go hard
Down to my inlaws, they outlaws with no laws

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
We outlawed then I bogart, any pros that got 'proached at
With a toe-tag, get broke off, in the projects with a skateboard
I roll past and I blaze y'all like, "DOO DOO!" I hate y'all
When the beef cooked, I ate y'all like, "Mmm mmm,"
Let's play ball in a ballpark with all sharks and a blindfold
I rhyme cold, my K hot, your 9 cold, that bark like K9's on
That banana clip, straight from the rip
I'll make that shirt say RIP, I'm on some shit
If I'm not the hottest then Hell must've froze over
You thought it was safe then forgot what the code was
I carry traits of a traumatized soldier
Don't look in my face, I might snap, I might choke ya
Spine right out of place, give me dap like you 'posed ta
Darts at your posters, dark nights like this
I metamorph like I'm 'posed ta, I might slice my wrist
Or pretend like a vulture and drop off this cliff

[Verse 3: Joey Bada$$]
Barely even conscious, talking to my conscience
Gettin' deeper in these flows like conches
I'm on my convict, don't drop bars, I drop prisons
Don't sell rocks, seen the spectrum through the prisms
Somehow bypassed the bias and the -isms
The violence and the killin', so given
They seen my pigment and thought that was the ign'ance
Unfortunately I am not that type of niglet
But pass the pot, let me skillet
Just got back to the block from a 6 o'clock with Jigga
And I'm thinkin' 'bout signin' to the Roc
But my niggas on the block still assigned to the rocks
And I swear it hurt me soul
I try to prevail, but when I preach it only hurt their sales
Like you're only gon' end up either dead or in jail
But you my nigga, wish you the best for real

[Verse 4: Yelawolf]
When you mention my name amongst other white rappers
Or for that matter, any fuckin' rapper, fuck it
Painter, skater, musician, trailer park dirt ditch diggin'
Burger flippin', eat, sleep, shittin' human bein', you would be in
Trouble to body double or couple me to these others
Cause comparatively speakin', my reach is beyond the bubble
That they put me in, my vision's beyond the Hubble's
I huddle with Nubians, new beginning again
You in school at 10, late, Radioactive's goin' gold
And so? GREAT. Do I give a flying duck
If I'm applyin' love to my rhymin' plus alignin' us?
Alabama's climbin' up, wait, no I don't give a
Flying duck, nothing but a buckshot, Ch, pow!
Motherfuck your life, pussy blood clot
Ain't never been no rapper this cold since 2Pac was froze
And thawed out for a spot date at a Coachella show, Yelawolf

[Verse 5: Danny Brown]
Weed a different color like a hoodrat bra and panties
And my flow be overhead like pots and pans in pantries
Antsy cause I'm high like Michael Jackson penny loafers
Moonwalkin' on the sun, barefoot, with shades on
Bitch pussy smell like a penguin
Wouldn't hit that shit with my worst enemy's penis
Bitch when I say this I mean this: Ho, I'm the meanest
Dick so big, stretch from Earth to Venus
That molly got me nauseous, aw shit, no off switch
Lawless, obnoxious, on that "suck my cock" shit
That is my synopsis, ostrich posh shit
Hoes on some goth shit, stop it! You not this!
Novice, regardless, heartless and awkward
Cryin' tears of vodka prima donna at the concert
Adonis smokin' chronic 'bout to vomit gin and tonic
Just bein' honest, tell me, isn't that ironic?

[Verse 6: Action Bronson]
Swiftly, I shift the Bimmer 860
A heavy smoker so you know I brought the Blake with me
The moon’s reflection off the lake hit me
You should've stayed with me, now many Asian bitches lay with me
The face is silky like a tablecloth
My shorty gallop in the morning on the beach like a Chilean horse
Red roses dropped from boxes very often
Confetti torchin', drinking Henny like I'm Kenny Lofton
Outstandin'
I fixed the game between Georgia Southern and Gramblin'
You see us scrambling, selling Susan Sarandon
The cloud of smoke like the phantom
Damn this shit tastes like fantastic
You see me comin' through in each state
Just so the lord could put the fork inside the cheesecake
Cuffed to my wrist, I’ve got the briefcase
The gavel slam, I’m a free man, try not to eat ham

[Verse 7: Big KRIT]
Big KRIT, shawty
Spit like my last breath: casket rap, six deep
Eyes closed, the black is back, out come the 'Lac with flats
After that, bottles I can’t pronounce, like, “How you ask for that?”
Why you ask for crack and all you had was scratch?
All I had was rap, when all they had was wack
All I wanted was love, all they had was dap
Fuck them haters and fuck them hoes, a championship win is
The aftermath, ask LeBron, open palm slap a bitch
Walk the plank or break a bank, I’ve been in the business of sinkin' ships
Chokin' niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with
Resuscitations cost the label, I’m taxing if you want a hit
Clear, fuck your career, bitch, I was born here
Been a killer, '86er, nigga, that's my born year
Get the fuck from 'round here, that's just my country ways
Suckin' on your momma's titty, bitchin' while I was choppin' blade
Grippin’ grain, fuckin' hoes, candy paint like Everglades
Miss me with that rapper chatter, take that shit up with my bass
I put that on my sub, how could you ever doubt me?
Most rappers hoping the world end so they won't have to drop another album
B.B. King saw the king in me, so why can't you?
In order to come up close, you’ll have to dig up Cash and Elvis, too
(That wasn't no sample nigga!)
Muddy water flow, Dixie rebel past
Fuck your Louis flag, popping benji tags on your wifey’s ass
That’s out of line, but in living color?
I’m more like Miya Bailey on you rap motherfuckers, a true artist[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
These niggas don't beez in the trap, they like bees in this track
Just smoked out, I ain't talking 'bout what you toke out
Get choked out fo'rilly, thinking that this shit a silly dream
When actually reality ain't what it really seem
And I ain't acting on the scene niggas scream
The actions ain't screened, just well schemed
I'm trying to have wealth for my well being by 18
Pockets healthy green, what the fuck is 12 beans?
I need the cake and cream, stakes is high like fiends off a dream
Jet streaming having cuisine with the best seasons
It's the vet season carry a vest you know the reason
I'm in Chiraq and I'm getting blown like the breezes
Your chicken strip tease us, thighs leg and the breast part is the cleavage
She even lick it down to the bone marrow
She in love but I don't got a bow and arrow
I'm known to jack the booty like I'm sparrow
They ain't trying to see me in the battle, they lines is too narrow
They couldn't even outshine my shadow
They don't want the beef nigga let alone the cattle
They just want to ride the saddle, it's so sad though

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
Hammers present, you gettin' wrapped up
Uhh, jump out the Mack truck, black tux
Go 'head and act up, drink the blood out of the brass cup
Your jewels are fake those are glass cut
No snakes keep the grass cut
Thick dominican women skin cinnamon with they ass up
Sick spinning, I stay shitting like a sick pigeon
Different colors glisten of the wrist prism
Blicker off the hip hit 'em, spun 'em
Chopped an onion, in the process peeped the diagnostics
See my shorty draped up in an ostrich
Smoking weed from the doctor
As I sit on a train to Paris draped in fabric like an arabic
Mommy always knew her boy was talented
Come off tour give her 20 thou for nothing
Cause it's nothing to me I'm something to see
Sunk in the sea, Duncans on feet
Shits are shiny take a shower rather dump in the heat
Jump out the jeep looking fly like a bundle of geese, jeez
I'm on some shit
I'm talking 7 series triplets, bitches with military fitness
And my girl a shooter like Chamique Holdsclaw
With coke in the door, she used to play ball
For Christ the King, selling drugs got her the icy ring though
Me

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
The last black hippy to get a wiki
I'm in your city getting a hickey from your chick in her Vickies
Don't try act like I ain't popping homie
My style like Mandela meets Monster Kody
Cop backwoods by the box bro, OG only
Drop 460 for a zip, need 2 to be cozy
I hate to stunt but look me up
Evil Knievel ain't much when I do my stuff
Polo tee polo black cologne
Burberry by my nuts she won't leave me lone
The Levi's was on sale, but I ain't flexing hard
Flexing, never had a 24 Hour Fitness card
I told myself I wouldn't flip I made a little bit
I'm no magician but I hope this blue dolphin do the trick
Behind the mic with a thizz face
You take your Mrs. through my entrance thats a mistake
I got it bad like Usher Raymond
Middle finger to the plaintiff, screaming Top Dawg Entertainment
Look I don't know why you niggas hating
I take that back cause I know why you niggas hating
I just said it cause I likeded how it came in
I even used likeded, that ain't a word, I'm just saying
I got to be the greatest on this land, I spell high with
3 I's and I'll never never land
The rap Mike Jack, Peter Pan with 28 grams
Hendrix with no guitar, Albert on Adderall
Yeah, jug
Smoke 'til I'm Weezy don't worry what's in my cup

[Verse 4: Travis Scott]
Speeding, and damn I’m leaning, on the Kawasaki
In the lobby, got me dro codinein’, out in Abu Dabi
Chain beaming, hope it ain't anemic, cause you might feel drowsy
Out in Sweden, just me and four women, and we all playing hockey
Blow Scott La Flame, pimpin, no cane
Rocking the chain and hood with no pass
Fucked up the flow, nothing but fam cause niggas be hoes
Have that, pass that, light it up and then blow
Imagery abstract, it's like NASDAQ when I stock it up and then grow
Packed it up and moved to Goldman Sachs, my nigga Yeezy done taught me that
Young niggas in the Soho House spilling booze wherever the Barbies at
Damn homie, this a movie nigga, take a picture or somethin', where your Kodak at?
Scottie is tokin and swimming with women, he writing, producing, then score and filming it
Oh god, my god, this shit be like God-level
Nigga you talking money nigga, stacking several
Bonds over billions niggas the real is in the building
With Ye and Hova niggas know what the deal is
The deal is nigga the realest
Young Scott the rock, rocking from the Phyllis
Got my nigga Bronson, Joey, Ab-Soul
And you know a nigga pockets getting swole on the road, yupThe flows is acidic
Cruising in a slow-ass Civic, I got gas, hit it
Hold up, cops passed, I stop, laugh, hit it
Jakes is snake lizards, if they smell they won't come hither
Nigga, I hisses at your misses
Slither down her throat, spit her up, (mmm) delicious
I'm too malicious, this one for my mistresses
In distress, cause positions that I put 'em in could stretch
Them can't contest him, get the rude boy vex
True shotta to give him two shots, rude bwoy fi dead
Boom, bye bye in a batty man head
The sooner I die, sooner them gets ahead
So you do the math, put the pieces to the puzzles like
Voodoo in the trap, no string attached
In fact, it's all connected in the sense, neglected in the
Cents, plus well collecting my respect, respect[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm here, here, here, here, here
Have no fear, fear, fear, fear
Yeah, it's Jay Oh

[Verse 1]
Even if I got high, I still feel grounded
I'm lower than the pavement
But the shit I been sayin'
Got me feelin' Super Saiyan
So I rise into the beat
Y'all tryin' to touch sky
I'm tryin' to catch God's feet
Little nigga spittin' flame, 500 degrees
Little nigga spit it sick, 500 disease
On some legendary shit, thinkin' I should be deceased
Like Pac, like Dilla, like Nujabes
Maybe then they can recognize, I'm better than the other guys
I'm the shit, see I attract hella flies
And I get hella fly shit up out of Bedstuy
All these new kids in rap, I'm a pedophile
Rapin' 'em, fakin' 'em, makin' 'em feel low
Rippin' 'em, flippin' em, grippin' 'em ?
But I don't give a fuck, cause I'm stepped on like pillow
But now I'm going in motherfucker, dildo
On pink, Jada, super head
No sleep, I get famous, see my eyes is super red
I be writin' rhymes 'til my motherfreakin' eyes bleed
Never backin' down, even if you rip my spleen
Flow sharp like I was spittin' up a syringe
I can see my future clear, no help to Visine
I advise them, stay away 'fore I get violent
When I spit, it's like a grip to your neck, violins
Silence, silence, silence, silence
I'm risin', risin', risin'

[Verse 2]
I never run unless I hear sirens
I'm the gorilla nigga, y'all niggas be lyin'
If I'm lyin', then you dyin'
If you're drivin', then I'm flyin'
Futuristic flow, it's still real to dough
I do eenie minie mo just to pick a flow
I see you see the other real lyricist
You niggas get smacked if you ain't feeling this
I'm killing it, sixteen, but super intelligent
You're feeling it, oh you ball, I'm stealin' it
It's my time, I'm in my prime
I would never let another person write my rhyme
It's all me, no strings, Wi Fi
I'm spaced out dawg, I belong in sci-fi
When I see my dealer I give him a high five
Then I rise, touch the sky
Like Kanye, rappers are my entree
Hey my momma, Imma big boy like Andre
Let me do it one time for my mom-ay hey, hey, hey
Since a kid, you always clean the monsters up
On Christmas, I always got my monster trucks
Now I'm going in on these kids monstrous
Well before I do, ay mom gracias
Now in I go, back to the flow
I'm just trying to find a pad, I'm a tadpole
And yeah I'm that pole so what you mad for
Got a bunch a bad girls that I feel bad for
Lord have mercy on they back bone
Blew a nigga off like you're playing saxophone
Never gave a ho the number to my phone
Don't call me ho, call Tyrone
Nigga, I'm on, I'mma drive on
Just trying to get cheese, that provalone
Middle finger to them niggas too mad at it
I flow crack, I check mad addicts
And I could never go soft it's a bad habit
JayOhVee and I'm back at it!

[Outro: Joey Bada$$]
Yeah, damn
So out of breath
Feel like my lungs bout to collapse
Yo I felt that in my whole diaphram
Feel like I just ran 20 miles around the whole globe
I don't even see how that's possible but...
Around the whole globe, that's like a million miles
Whatever, let me shut up[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
Yo, Badass don't act or pretend, back at it again
Hit it from the back, she a addict within
I got her on some shit like "I'm a get tatted for him"
She a ride or die, slim, when she in the denims
Remember it like it was yesterday
Another case of "I fucked your bitch, nigga" but a more clever way
Quarter in the room to elevate, said if you ever may
Slip then hit her on the hip where the Beretta stay
Catch me somersaulting my eyelids
Awakened from a dream, just perceived how I live
So it's make believe, rather unique
Lavish, sweet all live in a rapper physique
Hit up a show then after retreat back to the telly with freaks
Pack up a bowl and we ain't even eat
But we got a appetite for cookie creases and treats
And they all got tricks up they sleeve

[Verse 2: Dirty Sanchez]
I'm ashing on the bridge, Mary Jane, fuck your cigarettes
I'm laughing out loud, ask me if I'm still stressed, possessed
Hope the boys in blue don't arrest yours truly
Respect but suspect, protect your neck jewelry
47s and Uzis, well-connected and recruiting
I be with my Mexicans, I know they got the toolie
I'm smoking doobies with like 20 of my goons
Hotbox the whip and let smoke fill the room
Even through my lenses, my sense is on the moon
Dirty be the name and I came from the black lagoon
I'm sick with the ink like infected tattoos
Just one love but the two-three's branded on my shoes
You would think I had a eighth the way I'm crushing them grapes
Had her whining for a taste, that's why she's up in my face
Them Apex taking over like we running with Apes
What's the verdict? Nothing but a fucking disgrace, nigga

[Verse 3: Nyck Caution]
This ain't quiddtch but you know the snitch get caught
Then get bitched like the bitch she brought, throw your fit then walk
When they clip all of your Christmas thoughts
There's no giving when they take what you got
Placed in the crop circle, doc with a smock, see
Art what we drop, shopping cart with Da Vinci
Whimpering, leave that risk to your Pros
Wrist full of stone, lapidate if they pass me the smoke
I'm strapped and irate, daps from the fake
Get me mad and I contemplate irrational mode
Don't think about nada, strung you by your collar
The flow father who balanced out his chromosomes proper
I'm going home partner like Posada, they talk beef
But toss the ensalada, peep the blue Impala
There's arrogant cops who stay intruding
Can't stop the 47 like protagonist in Absolution
Them wack rappers who track-eluding
Critic is a random student who use the Era as a new rap influence
Faster than ransom shootings or some cancer fluid
I still kill and you can't lose it[Produced by Joey Bada$$]

[Intro]
Muh-fucking Pirates (Pirates) , We some muh-fucking pirates

[Verse 1: Capital Steez]
Look, now I could start it off with a whole new excerpt
A revisit what them experts said first
Your favorite rapper’s a problem I’m the next worst
It’s the naked truth I seep through em like wet shirts
Life’s a bitch, well I’m a super soaker
The newest flow got the mainstream moving over
Mother Nature got me shining from the depth of my soul
So every time you see her rise in a super nova
And in a world of dead presidents and counterfeits
Our generation is bound to take a count of it
I’m Barry Bonds with my count of hits
I put a fork in it, cork in it, hoping that it kinda fits
And this can turn into a hostage situation
'cuz I been sitting patient and I’m kinda sick of waitin’
John Q holdin’ up the doctors and the patients but sticking up the nurses is my favorite

[Hook: Capital Steez]
(Heh) We some muh-fucking pirates, We some muh-fucking pirates
And I decided that I would let my mind just ride on autopilot one word decribes it (2x)

[Verse 2: Dirty Sanchez]
I be that dirty mutherfucker, bitches want to clean me up
She needs a rest from the cons n She wants me to cuff
She got double D’s, I call it a drug bust
But I’m not slipping over lust, in God we trust, plus
I came from the bottom, who do you think you’re touching?
Bust in ya girl’s face, I know I’m good for nuttin’
All I do is smoke weed, set sails, and wait for my connect to hit me back with a little sumchin’
I speed so fast it’ll make ya head spin, who who’s that nigga that’s revvin’ the engine
I stand out when I stand up never did blend in
These bitches say I’m smoothy, though I’m rough around the edges
Ak-47 , Steez already said fuck ya reverend, we guna do this shit until forever end
So fucking pirates guna rain/reighn on ya parade, my eyes are hellabent and I stay hella laidback

[Hook/Outro Hook][Produced by Lee Bannon]

[Verse 1]
And we smoking, toking potent herb
Preaching spoken words that just might poke your nerves
Hope you ain't scared, my jeep go "Scrrrr"
I peep the obscured, and what ain't normally easy to observe
I swear I'm born abnormally absurd
If I give you a piece of mind, you've been disorderly disturbed
That's my word, flip similes and verbs, now I'm eating
Retreating for seconds and thirds, y'all niggas seasoned
(Oh, you salty)
Don't worry what we ate, you don't want that plate
I combine yours with mine quake, and make the earth shake
Supernatural disaster on you half-ass rappers
Pass the herb to an actual pastor, word to the black lip bastard
I drop knowledge like a Five Percenter
Every time I drop a line, it touch like five placentas
Schooling your offspring, drop heat all spring
And stay hot for five Novembers, I think y'all niggas lost me

[Hook]
95 'til infinity time
We in disguise behind enemy lines
Women with no identity signs, they can't get my lines
I used to give a fuck you could find

95 'til infinity time
We in disguise behind enemy lines
And I just kill it every time

[Verse 2]
Instead of lead slugs, I spreads the love
Like a bed bugaboo does, I'm in the W with your lovable slut
I'm in the walls while you bugging her up
I'll do your girl like this beat, straight fucking it up
Y'all niggas nothing to us, this feels like nuttin' to us
Son, taught your daughter how to bust a nut for fun
Recollect and collect the funds
When she see the sun spit the proceeds when I cum
'99, 'til infinity beyond
Hold my peace full of energy 'til enemies be gone
Until then niggas in my vicinity gone
Peep the melody we on
But they don't know the remedy to these songs
Basic necessities on how to be put on
Cause they see my team, we strong, Beastcoast in your region
If you get dropped you can't rejoin, they wanna know
Whose shoulder we leaning on
But all we do is show them who we leading on

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Cause they will never stop for a young black male
Blackmailed in braille that means what he felt
And the very reveal could appeal
Put you on the Alcatraz trail or railroad to hell
Oh well, some of us is taught there is help
The other source is lost in all sorts of wealth
Uh, roots of all evil
The highest stars Evel Knievel
I see through people's door, the world may never know
How my third pupil show, Incognito and cold needles flow
And I don't throw subs, I throw torpedoes
The Don, not Cheadle, this don got a Cornelius fro
Afro punk festivities
This for my negus that's lying with queens like Nefertiti
Waking up to pyramids and big kitties
Gold soul theory, but what is life really

[Hook][Intro]
And the champion
Reigning that is
From Flatbush, Brooklyn

Yea.. back in this muthafucka
Reportin' live from a lyrical high
One time

[Verse 1]
Yo, with not a damn thing on my mind
But this rhyme, and a matter of time
To make this whole shit align
Like I planned out, nothing in life gets handout
Just stand out, ever since I hit the pot my vision panned out
Pressure boil 'til im fanned out
Now we the popular band
So they can't keep their hands off of the man now
Invite em in, give 'em that S vitamin
Baby Cham style
Got some Trini girl to soak it up, ShamWoW!
Damn child, you're killin 'em
Fillin' 'em, drillin' 'em with serums, of pure noradrenaline
High blood feelin' like the thermostat cracked left mercury spillin'
Your favorite rapper tryna earn stacks from nursery children
True emcees write a verse and rehearse it a million times
Just for the rebirth of a feelin' prime and golden
Shawty ask what I'm holdin', teasin' 'em
Know when the magnum blast eye squeeze magnesium
Used to be mad premature now I'm mad premium
From lookin' up to niggas, to lookin' up niggas meetin' 'em
Meetings with 'em, give 'em a high pitch like curveballs and helium
Young scorcher trying to evolve like Charmeleon
Million, yeah nigga, we tryna get a million

Got the bomb nigga, Baghdad, I'm blown away from a bad pass
Walk on grass, below skunk, I smell sole funk in the stash
My SB's, antimony I never had
I was more arsenic, vaporize when I got heated
Never jealous, solid as a rock n' roll fo' planes
No propellers, just some Pro fellas
Who you know better? Never lost my groove I don't know no Stella
It's a cold world without Coachella
A shady bunch, like under Interscope umbrella
But that don't phase me once, people say I'm crazy but
Call me young Evel cause I crazy stunt
Amaze these punks, drop swank like it's knowledge to ya
Mr. Bada$$ is ya scholar's tutors
Swank the lord and hallelujah
Still praying to the allahs, gods and judahs
Balance out my lows on a low high
Niggas ain't know I'm sitting so high
Balance out my lows on the low high
I'm like a low high

Yo, yo, yo, yo hit 'em high, hit 'em low
Leave 'em with no direction to go
Yo, yo, yo, yo hit 'em high, hit 'em low
Direct-less Indigos[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
I'm, in a room filled with holographic images
Path is limitless, death, well that's ridiculous
I'm a live forever, cause a legend never die
See the world as simple, but complex in its design
I spent some time just thinkin', where did that get me? high, more drinkin'
Now my head empty, so can it last a couple minutes more?
Pain a funny thing when you can't figure out the source
Bear witness while I'm checkin' bitches off my hit list
Try and understand the fuckin' message I encrypted
Ancient halucinatin' visions of utopia
Until I figure out that the perfect world, a lonely one
Never hold my tongue, vocal is a loaded gun
And I'm a shoot somebody in the face if they too slow to run
Mac Miller, I'm the only one, but I'm the coldest one, this is pandemonium

[Hook]
Got my middle finger up with a cup and a dutch spliff
Hand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public
Welcome to America, motherfucker, welcome to America

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Still, in a room filled with holographic images
Crushin' information into powder, then I'm sniffin' it
Directly to my head, never sleep or use my bed
Iller than the future death of you ingestin' Sudafed
Might head to Budapest just to get a Gucci vest
Hop into a jet, get some rest to diffuse the stress
See, this is what I do the best
Nothin' that you got except the bullet gettin' through my chest
Save hard, a Braveheart, a warrior
I take part to stay far from coroners
I heard some corny words said about my music though
Talkin' all that shit, sound exactly like a groupie ho
Most Dope, got you hooked, yellin' Ruffio
First you lose your mind, then you lose your soul
So what you talkin' about? thinkin' you're out of options
American born, impeccable form above and beyond, never the norm

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
Yo chick live in Pittsburgh? bet I steal her
Shout out to my wigga Mac Miller
Comin' up in a world full of killers
I'll be shaded up at the villa
With a girl that know what the deal is
They don't know I come from the illest
City on a map, we don't know how to act
Realest young rappin go getters in America
Bad chick get tossed around like the merry go
CV and Mac meezy takin' off on PJ's
We the future so every night is a new day
Sittin' in the studio, chain on and my hat low
Young visionaries and we sellin' out the rap show
I can trigger the wave in my sleep
Name paved, I feel like I am engraved on the beat
Wake up shower, get paid and repeat
Spit one flow and got made on the streets
Welcome to the land where you never stay for free
Swag worth a mill, drop cast let it deal, Veggies

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Joey Bada$$]
Bout to drop hot shit, runnin' out of patience, niggas not sick
Rollin' up the dankest loud, plane goin' mach 6
Rise to the top, the topics change the Glocks in the stock
Exchange that watch the price of life on the block
Drop insane, you can't stop this reign, Don't name drop in vain
Inhale toxic flames from tropic strains it's awkward strange
Last week he was nothin', boxers stain
Everybody love him and chicks offered top for fame
To the top I aim, testin' waters so up in the flow
No deal but flow so real keepin' in the scoops
Sun got shine, now he said he shady but he never dippin' though
Still facing L's you would think the niggas wins was low
What you think I'm in this for? Won't stop till the nigga who
Invented dope in the flow will behind bars droppin' prison soap
Begging for forgiveness, but it's business though
I'm record spittin' Guinness flows
Got it up in sources now he in the store[Sample: Saul Williams]
(Fuck You!)
I stand on the corner of the block slinging amethyst rocks
Drinking 40s of mother earth’s private nectar stock
Dodging cops, cuz’ 50 be the 666 and I need a fix of that purple rain:
The type of shit that drives membranes insane
Oh yeah, I’m in the fast lane snorting candy yams
That free my body and soul and send me like Shazaam
Never question who I am, God knows, and I know God personally
In fact he lets me call him “me,”

[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
When did rap turn into a fashion show?
Too many makeup artists won't let their passion show
The anti-social mogul, havin' 20/20 visions
In needa bifocals, for your eyes dilated ojos
Open wide, never did I owe hoes
Suck a dick dilated, tell my old hoes
Hit my main bitch in the Poconos
I'm not Pinocchio, I never lied I poke her nose
With the dopest dope, brand new Pablo, brand new God flow
It feel like, Escobar and Apollo
Swank apparel, I put a pic on the site ‘ya megabytes
Y'all niggas ticking me off like headlights
Get your head right, it all falls down
I bread right on the house
Eye was on 106 & Park and still on the couch like, Bitch fuck Jacob
I went to meet my maker, with 25 sacred stones
Told him save me a few acres

[Interlude]
Yeah, cause' we just some Amethyst Rockstars
Amethyst Rockstar
Amethyst Rockstar
Amethyst Rockstar
Amethyst Rockstar
Try aim at this Rock Star!
Time just keeps on falling, falling, falling

[Verse 2: Kirk Knight]
How is Hip-Hop dead? I'm still makin' a killin'
Banana clip peelin' and ho's I'm still stealin'
This is not for the soda pop niggas
Take me to the leader of the new school or the block dealas
Cause all these fakes mcs take from those figures
Is what get fake MC's infront of loose triggers
Can't knock the hustle though, I may just bust a jigga
And lookin' through my eyes, you can kinda get the picture
Mo money mo problems as you get notorious, inglorious, until you're a big Victorious, no show
Only way you get to see the kid is through a photo
Or burn-ed up logos, and the females come out at night
And when they find the pot a gold they strike, seducing me?
Wait y-y-yeah, you nice on the mic, yeah yeah, you lookin' right
Yeah, you just my type, yo
(Bitch, don't get me tight!)
Her friend split and dipped, damn I should've seen this
I'm in a boobie trap and thats some clever ass cleavage
Well, I think with my dick, I know you want to blow my mind for that reason
She said "You got clever speaking"
And after I'm done, I still got it leaking
I dipped off ‘cause knowledge a nigga is still seekin'
What you lookin' at son? I might rob you blind
Defined by every line, niggas tryin' to outshine
We’re both number one enemies, it’s sad though
One on one, and it takes two niggas to tango
Two niggas to tango
Watch me go Rambo

[Outro]
"Don’t Front on a nigga like me
Time just keeps on falling, falling, falling"

[Interlude]

YO!YO!YO!YO! (8X)(...talking...)
Hype here
Yeah hold up yeah

[Verse One: Uno Hype]

Let me start by sayin shout out to the greatness
And everybody here thank god that we made it
Cover your hands I can see the cards you playin
I’m just sayin don’t reveal em to the other side otherwise
Another lie how I be so fly
But really I’m down to earth; I’m not your typical guy
I’m not tryna put in work them other niggas is jerks
Relax for the moment and let that pussy get murked tonight
I don’t take em shoppin these hoes ain't even worth the flight
I was never the flirtin type but is it worth a try
Take her back to the crib so I can work them thighs
She was seeing a young nigga just work his eyes
Lookin for a real dude baby you gon search and find
I’m here for the night and yall niggas got perfect timing
Them just hatin niggas baby please don’t mind them
My moms trippin out I done broke the recliner

[Hook: Joey Bada$$]

And I know that you ain't used to this
I got you out here in yo newest shit
But I got something we can do tonight
The candles lit as if the mood is right
Only if the mood is right 3x
I got something we can do to night

[Verse Two: Joey Bada$$]

Oh I think she like me
5-foot pices oh I think she wifey
But she got a man he wanna fight me
So I introduced him to the bottom of my Nikes, politely
But fuck that, Here’s my number you should write me
I think our chances of being together is quite likely
I said we should go out on a date she said surprise me
Well I’m 16 now I should soon be driving
We can head out to the islands fine dinin
It’s the end of the month I get paid for the rhyming
Its all about the timing don’t rush it lets get poured up
Post up in the cut and do the grown up
Said I can take you high if you a smoker
Solar my style so vulgar
So baby is you down or what
It’s the smokers club you should get down with us

[Hook]

[Verse Three: CJ Fly]

Is the mood right, tell me is the mood right
Sip a glass of merlot while we watch the moonlight
I could talk about me but that’s irrelevant
Your makin me horny though you are heaven sent
I’m just kiddin boo I’m just tryna get wit you
Yeah you a dime but I’m tryna smoke a nick with you
Take you to the smokers club baby you could smoke with us
I could be your therapist if you open up
Open up when I’m knockin
We could go to lazy town cuz I want the noggin
Ain't the cheatin type so please don’t go Lorena Bobbitt
Your man my challenger well I guess I’ll have to dodge him
Get two milk shakes at Baskin Robbins
Wanna hear ya voice your girl you killin me with the silence
Think she slick when she missin I
She could never miss a flight cuz I made her Mrs. Fly, manTracklist:

Yo Badmon things
But yo, we out in L.A. though man
Shout to the leakers man
Yo, check it out

[Verse:]
The man rose, little concrete rose
Put your hands together folks, for the black roach
Bout to deliver, like stagecoach
Now I stay posting my nigga, now what's the signs
My fountain of youth is all drying
One minute we all smiling and then poof, we fall sad and then
I be digging deep for this thing, I ain't finding this
Either I'm insane or my brain and to be honest that's probably what it is
You've seen that you probably can't live with
You probably can't stomach, you probably can't ingest
At times you so hungry, got mad dreams wishing that it all get sunny
But for now it's money this, money that
[?], that's just sure when I lie
Even cause your homicide on the streets to NY
A little shortie asked me, what's my purpose and why
I told her "Save the Children", [?]
You said for sure that's thight, but what's the dollar signs in that
The hella fine dimes with that, ass so fat
The phantom in the Maybach, that black Mac that go (pew-pew)
That's when I said, yo chill shortie relax
Let me open your mind
Division is color-blind, it's fine the light can still shine
I consume this time, he begin to unravel
And travel to a place he thought that he would never find

[Outro:]
Badmon, yeah
Check it out, one time, yeah
I want my LA shit nigga
Yeah, I'm with the Leakers yeah
And I'm smoking reefer, big cheefer
Alright shouts to all my people out in LA though[Intro: Joey Bada$$]
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Come fuck with a pro
Bad thing, bad thing
What you saying mama

[Verse 1: Kiesza]
Tougher than a leather goose
I wanna say your last name
You ain't playin' by the rules
But you gon’ change the whole game
I don’t wanna suit and shade that cool
While until the love again
Danger when you make me ooh
But I think that’s a good thing

[Hook: Kiesza & Joey Bada$$] (x2)
Maybe that’s a bad thing, bad thing
Maybe that’s a bad thing, bad thing
I’mma fiend for that thing, that thing
Oooh

[Verse 2: Kiesza]
I don’t want to ever choose
Keep it jumpin' like a trampoline
No matter what you put me through
You always make it worth it
We go together me and you
Reebok's and a hoop chain
Enough to make me say I do
And I think that’s a good thing

[Hook: Kiesza] (x2)

[Verse 3: Joey Bada$$]
But in conclusion, it's only time we losing
We get deluded by these illusions, constant confusions
And every movin', any time that we doin'
What could be a great duet
Gets neglected, feel my solar plexus tryna get you back babe
Tell me where it's at, where it's at, at, at
Gotta pack of that yack, yack, yack
That'll probably snap that back
Hit the cat till it's cataracts
But you like the sound of that
Now bring it back, we the perfect match to start a culture, might start it happen
Don't get too attached, cause I adapt to change quick see
My way of livin' fast, be on my switchin' lanes shit
You're sick of all that anguish, cause you know how that game get
If you ain't speaking that dollar bill, then you ain't speaking that language
I'm, dancin' with this little devil
I, condescend when usually I'm on a higher level
Sip a little Red Bull
Now we growing wings, she's the girl of my dreams
I could, give her my last name but that's a bad thing

[Hook: Kiesza] (x2)5. Nas - "Queens Get The Money" Produced by Jay ElectronicaThat's right! Before he signed to Jigga man, Jay Electricity was off producing for none other than Nas. This is minimalistic beat 101 - a cold Jay Electronica beat stripped bare of drums. The piano throughout the whole record is a looped sample from "Summer 78 (Instrumental)" by Yann Tiersen

The track also features a lion roar in the beginning of the song. Nas uses this as a statement that he's going in on the beat and pulling no punches! – 0nelove4. ScHoolboy Q - "Hoover Street" Produced by SounwaveSounwave is an in-house producer for TDE & produced two of the best tracks from Kendrick Lamar's good kid, m.A.A.d city. The intro starts at 84BPM, switching to 79BPM when the beat changes from the first verse onwards. During the intro, Sounwave makes use of vocal layering and reverb to echo the "How'd it feel" section. The instrumentation varies; using drums and other percussion, synths, FX (scratches, Lex Luger one-shots) and occasional brass. Thundercat was the bass guitarist on the song!

The track contains 2 samples both after the intro and beat changes;
A subtle vocal sample from "The Chamb" by The Mohawks in the background and the drums from "Ain't No Sunshine" by Harlem Underground Band

Originally this song was called "Familia" and in the last seconds they switched sample, the prior was done by Alchemist so he didn't get any credit. – UnBalanced3. Capital STEEZ - "Dead Prez" Produced by Joey Bada$$The instrumental is dark and jazzy. It sets the tone for Capital STEEZ's rapping with the creation of a mournful mood, which complements the melancholy lyrics on the topic of his goals in rap

The beat was created primarily with a sample from a Galt MacDermot song named "Coffee Cold".The beat's mournful tone is due to the sampled meandering piano melody, heavy bass, gritty drums, as well as the eerie synth whistle

"Coffee Cold" was also sampled by Handsome Boy Modeling School in "The Truth" & Gang Starr in "Werdz From the Ghetto Child" – Jankoz2. Kid Cudi  - "My World" Produced by Jeff Bhasker & Plain Pat"My World" sees Cudi teaming up with old pal Plain Pat. He produced several tracks from MOTM I, MOTM 2 and Scott's original mixtape A Kid Named Cudi. The other contributor Jeff Bhasker a.k.a. Billy Cravens has helped produce several critically acclaimed albums including My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy and Watch The Throne. They collaborate with Cudi to give us a sombre yet vivid instrumental

Two samples from Le Système Crapoutchik's 1971 song "All What I Have" were used throughout "My World". The first is immediately recognizable as the strings that come in right at the beginning. The second sample occurring at 1:07 forms the basis of the song's hook, "This will be my world". Only Bhasker could pull off something like this! – treflip1. Kanye West - "Dark Fantasy" Produced by Kanye West & Co
The intro to My Beatiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is originally a beat that Ye got from RZA. Kanye and the rest of the producers then built around it, hence it's influence from the "bring-the-ruckus" aesthetic. No I.D spoke to Complex Magazine and commented on which producer did what part:While I was in Hawaii, RZA came down and had a beat—but before that Pete Rock had given us a beat and then he ripped the drums and made it the rap part of it. The parts that me and Ye did was the chorus and the musical parts. Everything was done separately and a lot of different people contributed. Then Nicki did the intro and it went crazyIt's a quick-paced production with a brooding production brought by RZA, West raps in a highly melodic manner - almost singing some of his verses. It contains one sample and one interpolation. "Could we get much higher" is sampled from "In High Places" by Mike Oldfield & Nicki Minaj's intro is an interpolation of Cinderella from Roald Dahl

There's also an interesting story to how Teyana Taylor got on the hook and backing vocals! – 0nelove[Produced by: Statik Selektah]

[Intro]
I don't give a fuck y'all

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
I've been down but never been out
Around the world since I been out
Now I'm about to fuck around, pull the pin out
Cause kids needs clothes on they back
And daddy need new gold spokes on the 'Lac
Ah- I still posing for flicks holding my dick head
At the table ripping bread with my day ones
Ain't shit change dawg I got the same number
Just a little bit of money and some fame, huh
The hunger stronger than ever
I can taste blood on my taste buds
Holler back at me in eight months
Glowed up like a rave in the forest
In all white eating orange
A beautiful life

[Hook]
It's a beautiful life (x4)

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
The high top Air Force One all canvas
Took those off, hit the stage wearing sandals
Four X white t-shirt, that's standard
And1 shorts, '96 on the camera
Baby got me stiffer than L.A. Looks
So I hit her with that New York dick
Number 3, John Starks on the jersey
Bitch I've been doing this for thirty
The hair on my face says I'm a dominant man with no regards
Catch ya boy on Queens Boulevard
Sunk in the seat of something classic
Sittin' on the floor like a gypsy in a basket
Damn I'm a bastard

[Hook]
It's a beautiful life (x4)

[Verse 3: Joey Bada$$]
The lemon grass in the bally shack
Hit up Chuck, what up I'm on my Cali swag
Cadillac dreams, transactions in between
The man and his cream, every thought brought the penny back
Ballin' off that, yo thanks for the alley act
Probably paint the cut, all black like an alley cat
Middle fingers up
You fuck boys, fucked up
Ya dismissed, had one shot but time's up
Make the block boys go crazy
Take a whiff
Ain't worried about another life
We tryin' to change shift
My reality, life from my ankle ain't actually all you perceive these eyes can deceive
Holdin' back but i'm never holdin' out
So i doubt what ya lil trap mouth chat 'bout
Know they strapped like the back of the couch
We the era, black out on any rat in the house
Smash ya spouse until the cat tap out
Asses out until she passes out
No doubt we gettin' cash now
Use to be class clown
Don't worry about beef
I'm feelin' like a cash cow

[Hook]
It's a beautiful life(x8)

[Outro]
