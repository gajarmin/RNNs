[Bridge: Ky-Mani Marley]
Slow down, don't rush
I'm here to keep the peace but I'm prepared to say, ay
Slow down, don't rush
I'm here to keep the peace but I'm prepared, now I say

[Chorus: Afu-Ra]
Yeah, I pledge allegiance to the hip-hop
Yeah, I pledge allegiance to it nonstop
What, I pledge allegiance to the hip-hop
Yeah, I pledge allegiance to it nonstop

[Verse 1: Afu-Ra]
Meditation, equality, it keeps me level headed, the men-tal-ity
Cool, calm, post-hypnotic suggestion
Never stressin, heat chambers never sweatin
Honeys cryin, cause her man she caught cheatin
Mothers eyein, sons cut down like bushes
Daddys sicker than the land lord, just evicted
Stressed to death, month to month until he kicked it
I seen ya hustlin on the dark streets, the mental
Look what you been through, you just escaped reality
Now what ya into, is just a technicality
Check it, deep inside of my head like T.V
The lifestyle I live so crooked you won't believe me
Lessons learned that I could walk a tight rope
Even though I toke and choke, don't provoke
Uh, now you can call me Afu-rastahood
Cause I rob from the rich and I give to the good
Even though it's for the money B, I'm droppin knowledge G
Straight shots to the head, peep the summary
Wake up in the mornin got me yearnin for food
Yeah, yeah what, huh, I'm that type of dude
Pledge allegiance, pay attention, payin homage
So much time held in my hand, none for college (college)

[Chorus: Afu-Ra]
Hey Afu, hey Afu, hey Afu, hey Afu

[Bridge 2: Ky-Mani Marley]
Slow down, don't rush
I'm here to keep the peace but I'm prepared to bust
They wanna guide my medication with their crooked laws
Say I can't hold a bong and smoke, my lord
But, if it's war that they want, we are ready, are registered
The king, it is he, who defends me
So when it's time for the showdown
We're marchin', the soldiers Babylon get throwed down
When the war is over we burn up the whole town
And my spliff will stay lit from sun up to sun down
Ay, ay Afu

[Bridge 1]

[Verse 2: Afu-Ra]
Stimulating, verses like blood work ing
Paper hits the pen like the needle to ya skin
Blow ya blood up, Xena, hero-in
More contagious than sex (sex), nobody flex
Dangerous minds, little kids throw gang signs
Treacherous times, too many can't press rewind
Stress the elevation, wrap my thoughts like a mummy
It's funny, how sometimes some smart ones are dummies
Scorin a million, forget the S.A.T
Now I, leap more towers than Pisa, peep the ether
Wrap it in a scroll, pass it off to Ky-Mani
Lessons of exquisiteness, verses poetry

[Bridge 1 + Chorus][Verse One:  Afu-Ra]
Peep the finisher, blemisher, menace to sinister
It's him with the, been with the, mic's Next to kin with the
Lyrical assassinate like toxic waste
Rocks is base, matches I burn up in your face
Travel through eons, mentally to spit it viciously
Slapping up these red-eyed devils, speaking fictitiously
They slipping B, symphony, mic styles they slipping me
A golden aura, it backs the voice you can't ignore the
Monumental essence, which crowds wish to adore the
Shimmering stone, lace like stylish, luscious, Tiffany
Sages when they meditate, prism filling my imagery
Subliminally, thoughts I set it, Synchronisticaly
The intricacy, complex levels my entity
No stopping me, I'm rocking the, Hip-Hop philosophy
Drummer drum it, preserve myself to keep me omnipotent
9 9 styles I keep it flowing

[Hook:  (Dj Premier *cutting & scratching*)]
"Randomly flip on bystanders"
"Blowing up the spot"
"Randomly flip"
"Take control"
"And represent, represent, represent"

[Verse Two: Afu-Ra]
Poisonous, venom yes, when I bless the mic and structure
Supreme ultimate conductor, eruption
Type flow, lyrical lava, torching up foes
Nuff combustion when I'm +crushing+, like Big Pun
Who's the one who makes the kids run?
Stun like stunguns; son, I hit your Fulcrum
Seas of MCs I part, and some may call it Biblical
Steady causing damage with words, and even syllables
Audio, it's too militious, call it vicious
No time for battling, competition I'm shattering
Astro-Physical, to melt mics my ritual
Something I couldn't stop, yo, it's just habitual
Flow like the breeze, with ease, of seven seas
You're to your knees, like hit by a disease
It's Afu, you know who, I'm coming faster
Pay attention, cause it's worldwide disaster

[Hook x2]: (Dj Premier *cutting & scratching*)

[Verse Three]: Afu-Ra
Listen up, now class was in session, stop fessing
Worshiping cars, clothes and weapons
Your reign is over, like any move of a chauva-nistic
Weak-ass, character misfit
You know it wouldn't, last forever with endeavors
Multiple bad moves, your head, you finally severed
Decapitated, by the new heads of state
Whose lyrical ideologies uncover fallacies
And dynasties constructed by the morbid
I knew it took time, but time it took to floor it
The next centennial, will start with minimal
Microphone controllers trying to bless lines with imbecile
Lyrical content, for devilishment
Body of the Life-Force, Styles be Heaven-sent

[Hook x2]: (Dj Premier *cutting & scratching*)INTRO (scratched):
-Yes, ah ha, I like the rhyme-(scratch)-the rhyme-(scratch)-the rhymes
-All of us are born with a miraculous ability to determine the direction
[Whistle] from which sounds approach us
-Let us (scratch) venture into new and un-chartered land
-People get shook up ya know when I'm introduced as God

[VERSE 1]
Energetic, poetic and athletic
You know I get down and dirty when it's time to set it
I'm tearin' through, clean your scene like ammonia
I drown ya, flood four corners, the perimeter
I wonder, cause earthquakes bolts of lightning
You couldn't test the one and only Mic Titan
Afu-Ra, now you hear it now you know it
The body of the life force came forth just to show it
Crucial, lyrical style ain't what it used to
Microphone check one two
I hit the atmosphere, give emcees visions of comets
Technique kicked by force the earth I hit and bomb it
Immaculate, conception with the weapon
Emittin' mind bogglin' forms to mental sections
Beats is cooked, base burnin' like it's lava
Throwin' shit together more iller than Mcgyver
I never tire, spirit live like a wire
I came to let you know fantasies burn like desires
Before I go, on this mic I show pity
Coast to coast I whirlwind through cities

CHORUS:
Yeah, I whirlwind through cities
Influential, Scientifical power
My mental violence will shower
Devour, at a crazy rate

[VERSE 2]
Enterprising, uprising surprisin'
Ultra-sonic, mind like bionic
Gets ya body up just like a roots tonic
It's ironic, negative broke to north
I hit the crowd up and scorch off like Molotov
Stadiums is ripped in half, the diameter
Of area, mathematics, straight up scarin' ya
Face to face, cheek to cheek eye to eye
Now many wish to battle but never wanna die
So they kick it, bout the finer things in life
Yes rings is nice yes but knowledge skills be priceless
And so I radiate platinum diamonds luster
Flavor, perform unique my cosmic savior
As the legend's told, the heavens cradled my birth
Time to get down for my crown and show you what it's worth
My energy level's about to reach the proximity
Perverted monk I whirlwind through cities

(scratched)- friends prefer to call him just plain God

CHORUS

[VERSE 3]
The intentions, of reminiscence is essential
On how I had dreams of a youth now monumental
It's comin' true, things I've said have come to pass
And emcees would get busy but still won't get no cash
Some talents get the stash with skills as half as yours
It's not about styles it's what the crowd you has applaused
This unified circle, slip up it hurts you
So I spread forth and my thoughts make miracles
With my syllables I'm killin' you, but never softly
I'm unique, my critique speaks of my physique
From Chicago to Cairo, skills like the mic
On emcees I make em think that I was Hiero
Glyphics, now the whole world can read the message
Fake emcees couldn't walk through my passage
Afu-Ra, shake the world with agility
Master self I whirlwind through cities

CHORUS (four times)Yo Afu (Yo whassup?)
Yo yo, c'mere c'mere
Yo let's freak that rhyme we was freakin the other night
(Yo I'm wit it yo just set it off)
I'm sayin though, after this, it's no turnin back 'Fu
(Aiyyo just set it off man)

[Verse 1: Jeru The Damaja (Afu-Ra)]
Pugilistic linguistics, check out the mystics, we're fantistic
(You mean fantastic)
Fuck it, you'll get your ass kicked
Challenge my verbal gymnastics
Vanacrobatics
Vocabulary calisthenics
Can't understand the mathematics are esoteric
Watch the style but also peep the lyrics, my lightning, my thunder
Way back I stomped out Hera-ca-les
But now I stomp out MC's
Can't chill, because the Sun don't freeze
Heavy metal, hard like titaniam
Alchemist, I turn wax into platinum

[Afu Ra]
Influential, scientifical power
My mental violence will shower
Devour at a crazy rate, I'm speedin' through your circuits
And I perforate ya data banks
Stamina, in the brain is how I slay it
I enforce my voice and I always must obey it
Endorsin' of central rhymin' remedies
Against any man at arms that can get with the
Eternal, internal, alchemist, I spill
Logic and science ever since
Throwing cerebral blows without my fist
Poisonous, Taoist
Don't mess with toys in this racket
Terrorists don't proceed to hi-jack it

[Jeru]
It's too perverted, you heard it, so now you get murdered
Test the sound system, it throws off your equilibrium
Deep concentration can't fracture the meditation
Competition is flipped on at random
Deviant monks attack the mic, it's mental pandemonium
And then some, you go for your hand gun
Psychokinetic forces proceed to smash in your cerebellum
Phonetician with more stamina than a Christian
My mind, C3 H5 N3 O9 like Nitroglycerine
I bust as Afu Ra crush
Clash with us and meet Cerebus

[Afu-Ra]
Ready, ridiculous ravagery, as I commence
I whirlwind through cities
Breaking down substances, combining matter
Test my hand skills and back bones splatter
Rough and tough although the mental will stomp ya
Pugilism electrocute like Blanka
Collaborate, all my words into verses
I instill the will without even curses
Slurs, esca-paid off the beat
Totally complete with the unique physique
Microcosmic warrior, indeed I'll destroy ya
And this mic, I'm taking over[ Steele ]
Feel this, feel this
Brooklyn's in the house
Brooklyn's in the house

[Verse 1: Steele of Cocoa Brovas ]
S-T, Supreme Teacher, read you like a preacher
Seat you down, make you pay close attention to my ether
My aura illuminates, removin the snakes who lay and wait
Lovin to hate, but we still elevate
Massagin the brain, utilize the wisdom contained
Through the knowledge of my circumference and how to maintain
Some nights I walk with the understanding, build cypher
Like Charles Bronson, vigilante ready to snipe ya
Ignite the marijuana, roll a cigar from Havana
Tony Santana, smokin in the Coco Cabana
Or in the sauna, after doing my calisthenics
Universal metrics, reversin the hex, cursin the sexist
Accepting my blessings, remembering my lessons
Take my dog's suggestions when he told me keep my Smith & Wesson
For protection, the streets is watching and they testin
They know when you're frontin and when you're representin

[ Hook ]
It's not where you be or how you be
Or who you be or what you got
Unique sounds, grounds is hot
We comin through, we tidal waves in this rap shit
Now how you be, now who you be and where you be?

[ VERSE 2: Afu-Ra ]
You wanna get with the brothers that's the illest?
The microphone have sex with my lyrics
Hit shit off, first move is doggy style
No premature ejaculation, last for a while
Flippin and turnin and splittin it, all type positions
Grabbin and tuggin and yokin it, all type of missions
Crazy - nah, I'm not that type of brother
My verses, when they out in the streets, they carry rubbers
I heard you're drippin, your rap style got gonorrhea
Exploitations of nations, look at this, it's here, yo
Seven days around the clock ass all in the videos
I know you like it, I do too, love the cheese
, yo
But this is hip-hop, stop it, go make a porno
Not player-hatin, on the mic I'm player-scrapin
Nobody seen it, whole eons change to zeniths
I bounce styles that's sexual, plus I'm intellectual
Thoughts transverse to physical, I keep it spiritual
I got the motts, you bust the dutch, I got the hydro
I just sit back on tracks and let it flow

[ Hook ]

[Verse 3: Tek of Cocoa Brovas ]
I give you agony, agony, agony, you wanna rump with me?
Constantly, constantly, constantly rollin a Phonta leaf
You know it's beef when you gettin stomped losin teeth
Because you sweet and ain't got no claims to the street
You'se the type to get shot and go explain to the cops
Come to court every day, make sure a nigga get locked
But I thought you had that big Glock that you bust a whole lot
Then why my nigga's sittin up in that little cell block?
I'm tellin ya, ock, the world is a spot for snid-akes
Niggas who hid-ate, do anything to get the pid-apes
Love to see me down and out, blood in my mouth
Steez all sweated out, tied up in my house
Can I live and still give, take my team on sprees?
Twistin out skeeze out of custom drop-top V's?
You know the pedigrees, always stay blowin the dick
When B.G.S. is the squad, the dice stay on the six

[Verse 4: Jahdan ]
Nuff of dem still in di valley of dry bones
Dem ah search dem Seven Seas, dem ah throw stick and stone
M-mh, dey gonna melt like snow cone
Da minute di countdown say dis ah di final showdown
Well some ah said dem ah star, dem love car
Dem at war, and a blur, dem nah really reach far
But nuff ah dem ah bafoon, dem ah goon
Cartoon, dem nah put out no conscious tune
A-fi warn dem, if dem nah listen, so we scorn dem
We gonna steer far from dem
I know that we are kings and we love nice things
But we not sell out fi no diamond ring
Yo, I got da Lord in ah mi mind
So any which part mi come, mi ah go shine
Trust me, we don't fear nothin
So don't boost up yourself like you are gon' do me somethin
Mi turn dem off like mi turn of mi light
Jah control di better part of mi life[Intro]
Perverted Monks style
'99 style, knowhatimsayin?
Comin at cha, this how we do

[Afu-Ra]
Paraplegic, my fightin stance too strategic
No shadows on my kicks too much Chi horrific
To be specific, I'm comin threw with jiu-jitsu
Bone crushin bone breakin as I get into
Scorpion styles, with the speed of a cheetah
Hit your pressure points with light skills, I be
The blaster, Iron Palms is elemental
Combinations damagin nations in the mental
Cerebral cortex is obsolete
You'll die ten times if you try to test me
Taoist master, rhyme style disaster
Studied on the cliffs of mountains readin scrolls
Holdin it down, iron shirt chigung
Apprentice in the temple with Guang Jung Nim
I went through torture deadly styles I'm the author
Ingested metals, yeah they made me supernova
Triple spinnin kicks, side kicks, and hook kicks
They come much iller, so you must be Masta Killa

[Hook 2X]
It's Afu, change my style, change the weather
It's Afu, change your mind, just too clever
It's Afu, all the weak styles I sever
Combinin two styles on the mic with Masta Killa

[Masta Killa]
The great ones have searched for the righteous data
To show and prove and master the separation of matter
And seein through death, never loose conscious of self
Shed a shell keep it movin factor
Sword swing it to the temple, mental state
Danger chamber, eighth yang slang, Wu-Tang
Train private soldiers in this rap game
Like that Shanghai chinky eyed chick from Bedstuy
Wing Chung from Lafayette, Stuyversant and Malcolm X
Fifty Seven Park, it might spark, it's the heart
One blood cell, featurin Masta Kill
After dark he goes, bust gone, trust none, touch one
Young chun, prodigal son, Killa Bees disease
Home grown, flown from over seas, city under siege
Ya eyes bleed, the weed got 'em red dread
Like spinnin roundhouse kicks to the head, he dead

[Hook 2X][Chorus: Lady Blue (Q)]
I'm sorry, look what they done to me (oh)
Left my love behind, to suit their fantasies
I'm dying, why won't they just let me be (oh)
I once was carefree, now I'm all so lonely
(Baby, don't leave)

[Afu-Ra]
I'm loving everything about you
Mad, cause everybody only wanna use you
Physically and mentally abuse you
Misuse you, and can't even console you
They only wanna get you dirty, treat you gully
Get ya bloody, uh-huh, it's not funny
Rappers bring ugly, straight to you
But baby girl, I'm on my knees, cause I love you
I'm loving everything about you
Inside outside, that's right, in every molecule
Forget the money, forget the crystal
Princess to a queen, that's right, I wanna see you smile
I'm loving everything about you, boo
I'm loving everything about you, true
I'm loving everything about you
Pure love I spit, that's right, look what I bring to you
I'm loving everything about you

[Chorus]

[Afu-Ra]
I'm sorry for your mistreatments
Frankly, I know you been mistreated
Fake prophets, false off our favors of filthyness
It's sillyness, with no love for the culture
Trynna get rich, yeah, it really makes me nautious
They're the reason, some women, they have abortions
Hip hop, you was my very first girlfriend
I focused to spit it right, my songs are an offering
Knowledge first, over beats, producers are sampling
Myself and creations, on the line as I offer in
It's kinda sad, that the toxins are smothering
Youth in the hood, poisoned by instant messages
Materialism, barbarianism, all types of isms
And schisms, by tainted vision
I watched you grow from a seed into a forest
I watered you and watered you, but your flowers are dying

[Chorus]

[Afu-Ra]
I'm loving everything about you
Mad cause everybody only wanna use you
I admit I used you, but together
We have family, my album's in your love
I'm loving your music beautifully
I feel you slippin' away
Come here girl, uh-uh, can't have my love gone
It's like En Vogue, I guess I gotta 'hold on'
I wanna drop it for the cause, I know you righteous
Spit something from the heart, help clean up the virus
Decapitate ferocious, peg leg rap pirates
They only flowing now, cause the dough flowing now
Who, what, when, why, where and how
I'm sorry baby, that you've been used and abused
And served like hell, some they say I'm a tattle tale
If that when I see wrong done to you, you know I got to tell
Tell, tell, tell, tell

[Chorus][Intro]
Yeah, Perverted Monk representin
YouknowhatI'msayin?

[Afu-Ra]
No need for cappin this
Brave boys, I break your back with this
Practice, math this, lyrical theatrics
You'll never, ever, brave the weather, I'm too clever
Conjurin Sandstorms, I'll freeze ya, then I'll melt ya
You know I dealt the, on impact, shots hit the ceiling
These lyrics, I'm wieldin, straight echoes through the building
Enemies efforts are foreseen in the mental
I make steel wrinkle at the blink of an eye
Terminate unrighteous conscious states
Imitate the stars, while they constelate
The heart rate, of my social eloquence, makes sense
Intense, with the roughage, you couldn't budge this
Mountainous, type of figure
So check it out, now you know
When you lookin at a real nigga

[Hook]
You know we rip it up, hit the mic like a virus
We never hide this, unique rhymes styles is righteous
Who wanna battle, which rapper thinkin they the nicest
Straight up and down, these rhyme styles is priceless

[GZA]
You eggshell niggas get cracked in half
My armed force throw a road block in your path
Beats smash, from True Mast, my shots blast
Shatter glass, crowd watch the sound sets clash
Quick fast, I let the darts off, with no doubt
Your bitch ass, you head north and break out
Snakes out, hissin, shots missin
Observe, and respect and listen
And if you get stung twice, that means he's rollin wit loaded dice
It's like gettin stabbed with ice, and watch the evidence melt
Immediately the blow is felt
Commissioner revoke the belt, the microphone
Microphone flow-er, fresh show-er
Of the rugged garments, break the bread like Noah
I'm holdin, ride the 808 Roland
Write til my hand's swollen, your no comp ya
Huh, I stomp ya, the monster
Worldwide record launcher, multiply and conquer

[Hook 2X]

[Afu-Ra]
Nemesis, bringer of disaster
With more moves then the Tai Chi Master
Killa and I get illa, cerebral warlord
My name's Afu-Ra, step too quick, and your thought's floored
Fury portrayed, sharper than a fuckin cactus
Conquerin globes, and universes with Galactus
Tongue lashes, it rattles, never sliver
Optimus Prime, fatal bites as I deliver
Lyrically deadly, mic flow heavenly
In dwellin intelligence, choose my weaponry
Battle strategy, bishop cover angles
Knights move next, L shapes the vortex
Forces break down, now I got the nitty gritty
You think it's a stalemate, but now I'm yellin checkmate
Ultra rhymer, stop breaths like anacondas

[Hook 2X][Intro: Rasheedah]
Desfrutar de ti
Hmm, oh, yeah yeah yeah
Oh, oh

[Afu-Ra]
You know I'm comin though hotter, drip sweat meltin ya collar
Afu-Ra takin care like I'm ya father
Some call me papa, through I'm rollin wit the rastas
Straight up and down, I'm like the sauce over the pasta
I'm well connected, to all my people's doin salsa
One of my trademarks, you'll catch me drinkin Malta

Knowledge yourself, Life Force'll make you move with this

[Hook: Rasheedah]
No hay nada, que me sostenga
Yo estoy lista, para desfrutar de ti
Quiero tu calor, arridedor, de me ser
Oh, oh, oh, there's just nothin that can keep me from you, you, you
There's just nothin, when all I want...

[Afu-Ra]
Sound Bombing number one right, hate blow it like it's dynamite
Destined too keep ya molecules shakin right
Flippin my script as if I was a gymnast
I'm fusin coast's together like I'm a chemist
A yo, you leavin the party yo I ain't finished
A dred shakin so hearty so what's your business
You callin my cell phone, sayin who is this
I throw to down to expand my interest
I take it higher, to master engraver
You know the chicas want that papi chulo flavor
I do it for the north south east west behavior
Wait a minute, hold up yo, yo there go my pager
Beeper beepin, ringin comin from my celli
If ya ever had days like this, then tell me
Praise due to this, show and prove with this
Knowledge yourself, Life Force'll make you move with this

More complex then mixo flicks or "Weird" Al Yankovic
Supposing a remix stick with some sick shit
Pistachio Absolut Tanqueray mix with tequila

William Danze one of the illest ever

I learn these criminal ways
Were criminals blaze at everything above waistline
You take mine you ain't that bad you must be mad
You fucking faggot got mixed up with another dude
May peace and blessings be upon you
How you doing brother do, No
Look if I was in a position of giving us faith (Listen)
Osama Bin Laden would have been shot in his face (Missing)
Like every life he destroy in the World Trade
I ain't got no patients for the faggot less great
Couldn't wait to hit the wake, with an O.G staff
Trained to shake'em, take'em and break'em in half
Using heavy caliber weapons for clearing the path
The same as we do in the ave nigga
Look (Look) is the legendary M.O.Piggidy back
Murdering tracks with Afu-Rigidy black

(Sratching)

(repeat twice)[RZA]
Give me the sign
Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh

[Afu-Ra]
Yo ayoyoyoyo ayoyoyoyo ayoyoyoyo yo yo
Ayoyoyoyo ayoyoyoyo yo yo

I float like a butterfly, sting like like a bee
Muhammed Ali can't groove smooth as I be
High karate, enhanced thoughts with kimosabi
No mixing me up, I might rock all day
Gots to the rim, fight for my kin
Like the X-Men, my sense will be simile dressing and visually
Pounce my flows round the rings of Saturn
Gore-texxing, next section, jet-settin'
My key code kept alpha-numeric
Ready to set it, payin' the bills, you couldn't get it
The blemisher-finisher, finish too sinister
Or do you want the asiatic, acrobatic, chiropractic
Merit through the backflips
Supersonic, chronological, logical
Weeble and wobble you, ill specifics
Power flows through it, knowledge ready to rip shit

We get you open with the dangerous language ([RZA] Dangerous)
We keep you moving when we bang this, bang this ([RZA] Di-dangerous)
Straight shots to the head when we sang this
Drop bombs on this mic, nigga, bang this

[RZA]
It's the big double dancer, extravaganza
Zodiac: Cancer, who's the boss?
Tone Danza? No
Bob Digi son, I lodge fifty
Shots to your mouth, buck, and dodge swiftly
City crisis, I roll with po-lices
Ain't known to slap dick on Almighty Isis
As I bathe in the Jordan
Collect calls from Commissioner Gordon
Cult class when I play with the organ
Now I'm a black free man like Morgan
Knock your head out the park as if I'm Joe Black
Walkin through the halls with bat showin no heart
Zig Zag put your ass in the shit bag
And steal the show from the thief with a black gag
You can run from the gun but you get tagged
And I'm back at my lab humming fat bags

[Afu-Ra]
We get you open with the dangerous language ([RZA] Dangerous)
We keep you moving when we bang this, bang this ([RZA] Dangerous)
Straight shots to the head when we sang this
Drop bombs on this mic, nigga, bang this
We get you open with the dangerous language ([RZA] Dangerous)
We keep you moving when we bang this, bang this ([RZA] Di-di bodododododo)
Straight shots to the head when we sang this
Drop bombs on this mic, nigga, bang this

One time in the place to be
I'm on the mic, and you know I'm straight rippin' it, G
Check, one two in your face you see
Afu-Ra transform to electricity
My esoterics lyrics, I said it, you're synthetic or sympathetic
Rock timbies in peetree dishes
Watch me set it, yo
Microscope and you transmit through the local news
Even though I spit to youths, got to spit the truth
I'm insane with the jingle
I'm biggin up my knowledge, the rhmyes, the beats, they mingle
I'm gettin busy with the lingo
Now you don't want it, they don't want it
Crack that ass like a Pringle
Paganistic with symbols and visuals
Adults flock like sheep need miracles
It's simple to see, that you holdin with the fairies
Thinking of a rap name, you're straight imaginary

We get you open with the dangerous language ([RZA] Dangerous)
We keep you moving when we bang this, bang this ([RZA] Dangerous)
Straight shots to the head when we sang this
Drop bombs on this mic, nigga, bang this
We get you open with the dangerous language ([RZA] Dangerous)
We keep you moving when we bang this, bang this ([RZA] Dangerous)
Straight shots to the head when we sang this
Drop bombs on this mic, nigga, bang this

Feel this, feel this
Brooklyn's in the house
Brooklyn's in the house

[Verse 1: Steele of Cocoa Brovas ]
S-T, Supreme Teacher, read you like a preacher
Seat you down, make you pay close attention to my ether
My aura illuminates, removin the snakes who lay and wait
Lovin to hate, but we still elevate
Massagin the brain, utilize the wisdom contained
Through the knowledge of my circumference and how to maintain
Some nights I walk with the understanding, build cypher
Like Charles Bronson, vigilante ready to snipe ya
Ignite the marijuana, roll a cigar from Havana
Tony Santana, smokin in the Coco Cabana
Or in the sauna, after doing my calisthenics
Universal metrics, reversin the hex, cursin the sexist
Accepting my blessings, remembering my lessons
Take my dog's suggestions when he told me keep my Smith & Wesson
For protection, the streets is watching and they testin
They know when you're frontin and when you're representin

[ Hook ]
It's not where you be or how you be
Or who you be or what you got
Unique sounds, grounds is hot
We comin through, we tidal waves in this rap shit
Now how you be, now who you be and where you be?

[ VERSE 2: Afu-Ra ]
You wanna get with the brothers that's the illest?
The microphone have sex with my lyrics
Hit shit off, first move is doggy style
No premature ejaculation, last for a while
Flippin and turnin and splittin it, all type positions
Grabbin and tuggin and yokin it, all type of missions
Crazy - nah, I'm not that type of brother
My verses, when they out in the streets, they carry rubbers
I heard you're drippin, your rap style got gonorrhea
Exploitations of nations, look at this, it's here, yo
Seven days around the clock ass all in the videos
I know you like it, I do too, love the cheese
, yo
But this is hip-hop, stop it, go make a porno
Not player-hatin, on the mic I'm player-scrapin
Nobody seen it, whole eons change to zeniths
I bounce styles that's sexual, plus I'm intellectual
Thoughts transverse to physical, I keep it spiritual
I got the motts, you bust the dutch, I got the hydro
I just sit back on tracks and let it flow

[ Hook ]

[Verse 3: Tek of Cocoa Brovas ]
I give you agony, agony, agony, you wanna rump with me?
Constantly, constantly, constantly rollin a Phonta leaf
You know it's beef when you gettin stomped losin teeth
Because you sweet and ain't got no claims to the street
You'se the type to get shot and go explain to the cops
Come to court every day, make sure a nigga get locked
But I thought you had that big Glock that you bust a whole lot
Then why my nigga's sittin up in that little cell block?
I'm tellin ya, ock, the world is a spot for snid-akes
Niggas who hid-ate, do anything to get the pid-apes
Love to see me down and out, blood in my mouth
Steez all sweated out, tied up in my house
Can I live and still give, take my team on sprees?
Twistin out skeeze out of custom drop-top V's?
You know the pedigrees, always stay blowin the dick
When B.G.S. is the squad, the dice stay on the six

[Verse 4: Jahdan ]
Nuff of dem still in di valley of dry bones
Dem ah search dem Seven Seas, dem ah throw stick and stone
M-mh, dey gonna melt like snow cone
Da minute di countdown say dis ah di final showdown
Well some ah said dem ah star, dem love car
Dem at war, and a blur, dem nah really reach far
But nuff ah dem ah bafoon, dem ah goon
Cartoon, dem nah put out no conscious tune
A-fi warn dem, if dem nah listen, so we scorn dem
We gonna steer far from dem
I know that we are kings and we love nice things
But we not sell out fi no diamond ring
Yo, I got da Lord in ah mi mind
So any which part mi come, mi ah go shine
Trust me, we don't fear nothin
So don't boost up yourself like you are gon' do me somethin
Mi turn dem off like mi turn of mi light

Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la, bum-bum, she-lay-ah
All the pretty girls wanna wind up them way, sha-la
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la, bum-bum, she-lay-ah
See them lil' girls, buckwildin' in the place, sha-la

[Afu-Ra]
I like a chunky, badunki, mami
Word is bond, hypnotize a brother, like she was a swami, I be
All up on this dance hall, clean
I can wind up some tight, and have her spendin' her greed, come on
And face it, take it-take it down to the floor
Have her spinning her around, have her coming back for more, that's right
She fell in love with a king man, dippin' the end
The type of cat, that I can rip up the jam
I'm brand new again, a new tune again, I'm not a hooligan
Me and shorty, we enact the Blue Lagoon again
Crisp and clean with no caffeine, and don't you see
Her booty's boomin' her jeans, it's bustin' at the scene
And don't you see, shorty, yeah, you lookin' good shorty
You and me shorty, that's right, let's make a movie shorty
I know you see it shorty, damn, you kind tight, shorty
You and me, precise, that's right, we kinda right shorty

[Hook 2x]

[Jah Don]
The type that wanna battle, but they know I battle New York
They really wanna know what's up
They all set out to bank up, or they find out what's up
The New York, all sound, yes, that's us
Them girls, them type to time
We all see them, but then dey bum on the time
Baby girls, y'all free the bloodline
We all see them, but then dey bum on the time
When y'all off, and when I'm on, and then have to spend mines
Cuz each and every day, a blood can get in my way
So keep my minds in front, and don't send him my bad way
It's all about a better way, and really wanna try
I be there for you, and atleast I don't pretend, and do I try
Begin to hold it down, cuz the world is mine
So then me keep it sharp, as a dime, wow, wow
We held it tight, now, it's so tight, now

[Hook 2x]

[Kardinal Offishall]
Mr. Kardinal say, back up in it again, my friend
Yea a murderer, finish it again up to the end
Me don't play, me don't lay with them, we slangin' them
Strayin' them away from all the suckers, and no luck
It's the same ten steps, back up truckers, we high class fuckers
Girls looking real bugee, before they get stripped that's it
They come with a bag of talk, and a bag of attitude
But all I'mma trynna do is bag it up, and teach you
Dot City, where the queens in jeans stay
All of them ghettio chicks live around my movie, you know?
It ain't nothing, you cutting to a PF Cuttin'
Cuttin', then we trucking, ready to be with another suckers
Black Jay's from BK to UK
Stay the number one champion, with the girls, dun
Get it? Girls if you wit it, let me spit it in the place
What come, don't know why they waste, you know?

[Hook 2x][Verse One:  Afu-Ra]
Peep the finisher, blemisher, menace to sinister
It's him with the, been with the, mic's Next to kin with the
Lyrical assassinate like toxic waste
Rocks is base, matches I burn up in your face
Travel through eons, mentally to spit it viciously
Slapping up these red-eyed devils, speaking fictitiously
They slipping B, symphony, mic styles they slipping me
A golden aura, it backs the voice you can't ignore the
Monumental essence, which crowds wish to adore the
Shimmering stone, lace like stylish, luscious, Tiffany
Sages when they meditate, prism filling my imagery
Subliminally, thoughts I set it, Synchronisticaly
The intricacy, complex levels my entity
No stopping me, I'm rocking the, Hip-Hop philosophy
Drummer drum it, preserve myself to keep me omnipotent
9 9 styles I keep it flowing

[Hook:  (Dj Premier *cutting & scratching*)]
"Randomly flip on bystanders"
"Blowing up the spot"
"Randomly flip"
"Take control"
"And represent, represent, represent"

[Verse Two: Afu-Ra]
Poisonous, venom yes, when I bless the mic and structure
Supreme ultimate conductor, eruption
Type flow, lyrical lava, torching up foes
Nuff combustion when I'm +crushing+, like Big Pun
Who's the one who makes the kids run?
Stun like stunguns; son, I hit your Fulcrum
Seas of MCs I part, and some may call it Biblical
Steady causing damage with words, and even syllables
Audio, it's too militious, call it vicious
No time for battling, competition I'm shattering
Astro-Physical, to melt mics my ritual
Something I couldn't stop, yo, it's just habitual
Flow like the breeze, with ease, of seven seas
You're to your knees, like hit by a disease
It's Afu, you know who, I'm coming faster
Pay attention, cause it's worldwide disaster

[Hook x2]: (Dj Premier *cutting & scratching*)

[Verse Three]: Afu-Ra
Listen up, now class was in session, stop fessing
Worshiping cars, clothes and weapons
Your reign is over, like any move of a chauva-nistic
Weak-ass, character misfit
You know it wouldn't, last forever with endeavors
Multiple bad moves, your head, you finally severed
Decapitated, by the new heads of state
Whose lyrical ideologies uncover fallacies
And dynasties constructed by the morbid
I knew it took time, but time it took to floor it
The next centennial, will start with minimal
Microphone controllers trying to bless lines with imbecile
Lyrical content, for devilishment
Body of the Life-Force, Styles be Heaven-sent

[Hook x2]: (Dj Premier *cutting & scratching*)[Afu-Ra]
I put my ears to the streets, and got hostile
A-F-U, I'mma show you my style
All the ladies get buck, and show me your style
You wanna ride with king of the rodeo
My style will play your globe, it's like audio
Before I step in the club, I drink a forty, yo
I be the type of cat, with a flow that can gat
Bust a shot for my niggas, holla, where ya at
East coast, that's right, get it crunk
Get drunk, that's right world, don't get it fucked up
I'm on the course, I will change the game
I'm dropping into the main frame, to be a stain and remain
And I'm bound to be a link in the chain
I'm hotter than a smoking barrel, yo
Or dress like little shorty, when she got her period
Yea, don, word is bond, I gotta flow

[Hook: ? (Afu-Ra)]
The rawest nigga, to ever spit it
(Brooklyn, represent, yeah my people gonna feel this)
The rawest nigga, that ever spit it
(Yeah, holla at them tints, right there, he on the guestlist)
The rawest nigga, to ever spit it
(BK, stand up, yeah, my niggas gonna feel this)
The realest nigga, that ever spit it
(And now I'm all around the world, you just don't wanna hear it)

[Afu-Ra]
I ain't no rap sinner, I'm a nigga spittin' toxic
Shake ya bon bon, yo, and let me rock this
To everybody, take a chill, you can't stop this
Pardon me Flex, brace ya self let me drop this
Scorch like the sun burning in the tropics
Sperm rap acts up, yup, in every topic
I be the freshest artist to hit the market
Everybody get ya body rocked by this
Whether outside or inside, nothing can stop my ride
I hit the charts up, like I hit a drive by
When my voice and the track collide
Yo, I take ya legs out like ya stepped on a land mine
Nine times nine, that's how many styles I got for this rhyme
And I'mma hit ya with a punch line
Clap back, it go clap back
And If I got to, yo, I'm ready for war, ready to bust back

[Hook]

[Afu-Ra]
I'm fresh hell walls, like a schizephrenic rapist
Every album banks in a box, like it's Christmas
What clinch this, I'm ready to dismiss
The mix of this odyssey shit, and plenty presidents
You represent, I represent, yo dog
I'm all about the beats, and the rhyming and shit
I can flow all day or flow all night
And each one of my verses, could be used as a night light
I let the vibrations, venacular
Scoop up a chase for cakes, like a spatula
Now that I captured that, I got ya gasping for
More the same thing, that's what you ask me for
Verbal debris, wash the shorelines
Globally, I'm respected worldwide lyrically
I got more bounce than bounce
And I ain't trynna make ya bounce
I'm just trynna show you what I'm about

[Hook]

[Hook 4x: Afu-Ra]
Yup, spread out, but wait
I'm on your body, yeah, yeah
We came to mash up the whole party*Forest Whitaker reading*

[Jeru]
Samurai linguist, others suck like ?Cunnylingus?
I burn shit up like a poison penis
Make your whole style seem meaningless
Match wits wit this
Call your squad the hole of Fortress
I swoop down like a dirty Brooklyn pigeon
Swing my sword wit precision
Lightning speed blurs your vision
Like a surgeon wit razor sharp incision
Subconcious like hypnotism
Water on the brain, the mental baptism
Put your aura in prison
Block up your chi, and bend your light like a prism

[Afu-Ra]
Yeah, ghost walkin the dog stand personified
Study lessons and plant seeds to fertilize
Straight up, I slaughter the ? that's got the order
Spit flyin straight at my mouth is holy water
I damage flows, on the mics crushin your matter
And saw you scatter, and couldn't put you back together
Fist of ten rings, I'm scrapin Jews up out the gutter
Hittin ya, splittin ya floss like Forest Whitaker
Sick wit the, get wit the thoughts next to K.I.M
With the utmost, you want lyrics, here's an overdose
Preverb'll Taoist, styles you'll be a ghost
I did it a lot, I been in the spot, I rip it alot
And now some motherfuckas wanna try to scheme and plot
And takin chances in life like throwin dice
It's Afu-Ra, I return from death twice
You talkin bout skills? Yeah yeah, I'm twice as nice
Take it to the apex, and push it high-tech
These petty MC's, they picture-paintin hot sex
I melt tracks, I bomb sets wit hot wax
You want some spiritual syllables wit the chemicals
Murdered down eighty-five percent subliminal
Ten percent, fire burn em wit my visual
Five percent, we break bread all in the mental
I keep it comin like rotisserie, and missin me
Straight up and down, I let you know I do it wickedly

*Vocal sample*

Chorus [Jeru] 3x
It's the Code of the Samurai, prepare to die
Know you'll die, Brooklyn E-N-Y

It's the Code of the Samurai...[Bridge: Ky-Mani Marley]
Slow down, don't rush
I'm here to keep the peace but I'm prepared to say, ay
Slow down, don't rush
I'm here to keep the peace but I'm prepared, now I say

[Chorus: Afu-Ra]
Yeah, I pledge allegiance to the hip-hop
Yeah, I pledge allegiance to it nonstop
What, I pledge allegiance to the hip-hop
Yeah, I pledge allegiance to it nonstop

[Verse 1: Afu-Ra]
Meditation, equality, it keeps me level headed, the men-tal-ity
Cool, calm, post-hypnotic suggestion
Never stressin, heat chambers never sweatin
Honeys cryin, cause her man she caught cheatin
Mothers eyein, sons cut down like bushes
Daddys sicker than the land lord, just evicted
Stressed to death, month to month until he kicked it
I seen ya hustlin on the dark streets, the mental
Look what you been through, you just escaped reality
Now what ya into, is just a technicality
Check it, deep inside of my head like T.V
The lifestyle I live so crooked you won't believe me
Lessons learned that I could walk a tight rope
Even though I toke and choke, don't provoke
Uh, now you can call me Afu-rastahood
Cause I rob from the rich and I give to the good
Even though it's for the money B, I'm droppin knowledge G
Straight shots to the head, peep the summary
Wake up in the mornin got me yearnin for food
Yeah, yeah what, huh, I'm that type of dude
Pledge allegiance, pay attention, payin homage
So much time held in my hand, none for college (college)

[Chorus: Afu-Ra]
Hey Afu, hey Afu, hey Afu, hey Afu

[Bridge 2: Ky-Mani Marley]
Slow down, don't rush
I'm here to keep the peace but I'm prepared to bust
They wanna guide my medication with their crooked laws
Say I can't hold a bong and smoke, my lord
But, if it's war that they want, we are ready, are registered
The king, it is he, who defends me
So when it's time for the showdown
We're marchin', the soldiers Babylon get throwed down
When the war is over we burn up the whole town
And my spliff will stay lit from sun up to sun down
Ay, ay Afu

[Bridge 1]

[Verse 2: Afu-Ra]
Stimulating, verses like blood work ing
Paper hits the pen like the needle to ya skin
Blow ya blood up, Xena, hero-in
More contagious than sex (sex), nobody flex
Dangerous minds, little kids throw gang signs
Treacherous times, too many can't press rewind
Stress the elevation, wrap my thoughts like a mummy
It's funny, how sometimes some smart ones are dummies
Scorin a million, forget the S.A.T
Now I, leap more towers than Pisa, peep the ether
Wrap it in a scroll, pass it off to Ky-Mani
Lessons of exquisiteness, verses poetry

[Bridge 1 + Chorus][Afu-Ra]
Yo, I'm straight rockin' it
Hit the block with it, chessboxing it
If I can't shoot it, I ox it

And I'm reppin' for Brooklyn, tools in my rocket
Broke right outta my cage, I'm gonna rock it
Ooh, that's how I spit, chill, yo I got this
I bust a move, one-two, shell shocking it
Put words together, make you stacking it, tackle it
I'm well endowed, and my flows quite accurate
I pull rabbits out my hat on some magic ish
Presto change-o, I do my thing, yo
Three sixty spin into Dr. Strange, yo
Wa-da-da-deng, wa-da-da-da-da-deng yo
Fuck gaming, and the gamer who spittin flames yo
I do this for my people whose minds in them chains yo
So everybody that's really to roll, get ready to eat
Because I'm cooking on this track yo

[Hook: Afu-Ra]
"I said hey hey hey hey"
You know I be the god of the rap, the couldn't hold me back"
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yea"
I'm burning that purple, dog, you want some of that?
"I said hey hey hey hey"
Wanna murder these tracks, the god, know how to act
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yea"
I'm bout to rep with skills, hold on, they couldn't hold me back

[Hook: Afu-Ra]
I gotta be, all I can be
No matter what nobody wants from me
I gotta be, all I can
No matter what nobody wants from me
I had a revelation
To speak my mind with a good vibration
Aiy, don't matter what you saying
I'm hardcore with my rap and I ain't playing
I get around, get around, get around
Uh-huh, a force untold with so much soul
A twenty four karat heart of gold
I get around, get around, I get around
Uh-huh, a stop drop and rock, and shock yo town
Listen to the way that I scream it now

[Hook]

[Afu-Ra]
Wanna run up? Put the smackdown, crack down
On the track now, matter fact, it's a fact now
Million stops, earthquakes from the beats, move the streets
I got the treats and it's a rap now
My sex is engulfed in a small pack of pow wow
I weigh the crowd for having a sound
That astounds the pounds, of leading to the track to the ground
And surround clowns with more color in they faces
In any circus in any town, uptown, downtown
Straight up and down, holler at the moon, now
Straight bring it to your face, kid
Blind ya like the police, sprayin' that mace, kid
I get around, get around, get around
Uh-huh, a stop drop and rock, and shock ya town
Listen to the way that I scream it now

[Hook]

[Hook]Yo yo yo yo

Chorus:

Y'all want some hip hop, then holler HELL YEAH
Y'all want some hip hop, then scream HELL YEAH
Feel this hip hop, and yell HELL YEAH
Y'all know we 'bout to bring it here, fake cats get up outta here

[Repeat Chorus]

Verse 1:
See whatcha like gimme the mic
I'm rippin and flippin and grippin it tight
Say whatcha like, don't play with me right?
I ride your chain from day to night
Head first with a verse
You see my excerpts got eskimos in igloos sweatin and seek in search
In self-worth, through the knowledge that all age enter the earth
Till the devils and his dogs I fool I'll be the fuckin curse
Spit fire more fire with my nigga Fire
I backflip blindfolded on a highwire
Then fall back on my team and dream of lividcism
I met Noah before the ark and started rhymin with him
If I wanted to flow with him reactin like a cataclysm
And shockwavin my rights into the system

[Chorus]

Verse 2:
Now set trippin and sweatin the aesthetics
The chick's beef hits your ass up like diabetics
I bet it gets, I wrestle it, second album be the predicate
No mismatches, no maxin or relaxin
Toast with the awesome two, break it like your fractions
Peep the equation, these Pythagorean thereom
I know the science for the metals and all the plenums
Until you hate it, young children have been mutilated
It looks good and some of y'all be desecratin
Incineratin wastin your state in the outer space
It's wicked right I hit it right slice doors with a butter knife
I'm makin moves on the mic like I was dice

Y'all want some hip hop, then holler HELL YEAH
Y'all want some hip hop, then scream HELL YEAH
Feel this hip hop, and yell HELL YEAH
Y'all know we 'bout to bring it here, we transcend we outta here

[Chorus]

Verse 3:
Tippin you off bringin it forth, knowledge be the jump-off
Wax on wax off, liquid form-I turn to hot sauce
While some may want they salad tossed I can bust like Matatov
Now get your saddle off, quit bustin, no towelin off
Some pip squeaks in the game night ride like Hasslehoff
Stand back to your skin and feel my G-force
Tic tac toein I keep it flowin and flowin
No need for detonators my shit be mind blowin
Blind the sights likes of Ihmotep
Flippin the script ring the alarm like Ghengis Khan
Who rocks all takes all kick it like Win Chaw
Or ping pong crackin the mic, the dreaded King Kong

[Chorus]

Y'all want some hip hop, then holler HELL YEAH
Y'all want some hip hop, then scream HELL YEAH
Feel this hip hop, and yell HELL YEAH
Y'all know we 'bout to bring it here, we transcend we outta here[Hook 2X]
Become gangsta (murderer)
Pick up a toolie out the area (murderer)
Become gangsta (murderer)
Still livin' like dat, dat, dat

[Afu-Ra]
First and foremost, I be the funneling punishing
Lyrical acrobat, whose quite astonishing
Solar stance on the track, mentals to try me
I snatch your heart right out your chest like Priest Pai Mei

[Masta Killa]
Free from the Killa Bee, who is this I.T.T
With enough cheese, from the city where they rip the beast
With techniques, he seek, build or destroy
White toe on his tag, snatch his flag

[Afu-Ra]
Ref techniques, from the force of the transcontinental
Monumental, snatch your soul or your mental
Diamond mic splittin', that's right, the unforgiven
Flying guillotine, rip my raps, where the Killa's at?

[Masta Killa]
We straight out the basement
Double shotgun, left his brains on the pavement
Tasted, the cement ear, he smell it when it's deep
You know when to tuck your heat
And start creep, through the streets with the

[Hook 2X]

[Masta Killa]
I get wicked when I spit it, see the picket signs
Lines of people, they wanna hear it
The dart with the eye in kamosi
Special guest star, Jamel Irief, Afu-Ra
Exhibition, mic spar, for the televised fans
Across the nations, so steal at ten bases
Spin around scratching his crown, gun down
Another sound boy for dead, step in the chamber
Something like Thrilla Manila, but it's iller

[Afu-Ra]
It's been a long time, stunnin' and gunnin', let's make it simple
Fifty strikes, light up the mic, make it official
Live your lessons, don't bring your hood up in the temple
Masterin' styles, the spinning kicks and the tripped out physic
Perverted Monks, shining the light, y'all be holding this
My art of design, is silver surf through the cosmo's
I lightsabe my ways, so my flow's can float
My quest for this zest, so yes, to be the rhyme most

[Hook 2X]

[Masta Killa]
No man, no army can calm me, if he cross
He just lost a bet of his life, sent the wrong kite
Watch it where you moving at night, but either way
In the day, you still pray, any way you lay your head

[Afu-Ra]
Super kinetic and magnetic, who ready to set it
One with the sun, now tell my mind to take control of the planets
Blazed with the heat behind stars, that's ultraviolet
I'm ready to ride hardcore, just like my style is
Press the venacular, of the highest stature
My lyrical dycatomy --- spectacular
Blum-blum, give it to 'em raw
Listen to the brothers who get rugged and rawYo Afu (Yo whassup?)
Yo yo, c'mere c'mere
Yo let's freak that rhyme we was freakin the other night
(Yo I'm wit it yo just set it off)
I'm sayin though, after this, it's no turnin back 'Fu
(Aiyyo just set it off man)

[Verse 1: Jeru The Damaja (Afu-Ra)]
Pugilistic linguistics, check out the mystics, we're fantistic
(You mean fantastic)
Fuck it, you'll get your ass kicked
Challenge my verbal gymnastics
Vanacrobatics
Vocabulary calisthenics
Can't understand the mathematics are esoteric
Watch the style but also peep the lyrics, my lightning, my thunder
Way back I stomped out Hera-ca-les
But now I stomp out MC's
Can't chill, because the Sun don't freeze
Heavy metal, hard like titaniam
Alchemist, I turn wax into platinum

[Afu Ra]
Influential, scientifical power
My mental violence will shower
Devour at a crazy rate, I'm speedin' through your circuits
And I perforate ya data banks
Stamina, in the brain is how I slay it
I enforce my voice and I always must obey it
Endorsin' of central rhymin' remedies
Against any man at arms that can get with the
Eternal, internal, alchemist, I spill
Logic and science ever since
Throwing cerebral blows without my fist
Poisonous, Taoist
Don't mess with toys in this racket
Terrorists don't proceed to hi-jack it

[Jeru]
It's too perverted, you heard it, so now you get murdered
Test the sound system, it throws off your equilibrium
Deep concentration can't fracture the meditation
Competition is flipped on at random
Deviant monks attack the mic, it's mental pandemonium
And then some, you go for your hand gun
Psychokinetic forces proceed to smash in your cerebellum
Phonetician with more stamina than a Christian
My mind, C3 H5 N3 O9 like Nitroglycerine
I bust as Afu Ra crush
Clash with us and meet Cerebus

[Afu-Ra]
Ready, ridiculous ravagery, as I commence
I whirlwind through cities
Breaking down substances, combining matter
Test my hand skills and back bones splatter
Rough and tough although the mental will stomp ya
Pugilism electrocute like Blanka
Collaborate, all my words into verses
I instill the will without even curses
Slurs, esca-paid off the beat
Totally complete with the unique physique
Microcosmic warrior, indeed I'll destroy ya
And this mic, I'm taking over[Intro: DJ Premier]
Yeah, Afu-Ra, the Body of the Life Force
Yo, you know how I do son (yeah)
Yeah, so why don't you (yeah)
Get on this mic and represent one time

[Afu-Ra]
Some MC's you know they artificial
Some get straight chewed like gristles, I blow like missiles
Lyrics run right through your tissues
Afu-Ra reformed serial killer, it's so much iller
How my sound rounds could bill-a
Straight up bodegas of thought ya come across
Rhymes so dope, one verse'll make you somersault
Intertwinin, alignin wit the timin
Enterprisin, uprisin surprisin
Perverted linguistics came to rip shit
Strapped for life word to mom's carry ten clips
My ink hits from backyards to basements
Loose lips sink ships, ya drown this quick
Superbly, my words be, like third degree
Word to me, thoughts higher than planes be
It's funny to me, how my stun shines the jewelry
My symmetry, follow me, wherever shadows be
Lyrical elixir, turntables and a mixer
Bust ya shit like a blister, yeah, one, two, how we do

[Hook: DJ Premier scratches up samples]
"Afu-Ra"
"The Body of the Life Force"
"Rough and tough"
"Lyrical warrior"
"The Body of the Life Force"
"Microphone check one two"

[Afu-Ra]
Mic stance, starts the illustration
As I dive into creation, wit so much patience
Split my drink up your nation, but never cleanin it up
Stainin it up, molecules, my energy melt the cup
I'm usin fake MC's for target practice
To usurp your experts, will be my best work
I'm takin stripes, might snipe ya, cause I'm hyper
Will incite the shit too loose, I'll make it tighter
Flowin on and on like I was nylon
Sounds gong, check ti, Brook-nom to Saig-gong
My chord sweeps, from off beat to on beat
Lyrical symbolism, peep the visions
I make incisions, fabric of ghetto rhythms
You couldn't hold me, if you wore gloves or mittens
Lion of Judah type style, and you're forgiven
I set it straight, my jade pen obliterate
You titillate, chop you up for my shark bait
Incinerate your presence, scatter your ashes
And breeze by on the mic, like EZ passes

[Hook 2X]

[Afu-Ra]
I'm kinda killin a, willin a, instillin a, billin a
Yo, yo you talkin MC's, ain't nothin similar
Scatter ya, batter ya, internally ratter ya
Even through your dental records, they'd never notice ya
A dope style, so pure you couldn't touch it
Couldn't nudge it, diesel men, couldn't budge it
Terroristic type tactic, get your ass kicked
Never rested, jah blessed it, never test it
Undrownable, unsoluble, prolific
Lyrical typhoon crossin the Pacific
Chosen by the mystic, mic ways, I rip it
Usurp it, sharp enough that it can hurt it
Depth wise, verse wise, ensurin that the surge hits
Words hit, I do work like arthroscopic
Surgery, now my rhymes lacked the masonry, kinetic energy
Thoughts cause the imagery, natural disaster
Earthquake type telepathy
Yeah, one, two, how we do

[Hook 2X][Intro]
Perverted Monks style
'99 style, knowhatimsayin?
Comin at cha, this how we do

[Afu-Ra]
Paraplegic, my fightin stance too strategic
No shadows on my kicks too much Chi horrific
To be specific, I'm comin threw with jiu-jitsu
Bone crushin bone breakin as I get into
Scorpion styles, with the speed of a cheetah
Hit your pressure points with light skills, I be
The blaster, Iron Palms is elemental
Combinations damagin nations in the mental
Cerebral cortex is obsolete
You'll die ten times if you try to test me
Taoist master, rhyme style disaster
Studied on the cliffs of mountains readin scrolls
Holdin it down, iron shirt chigung
Apprentice in the temple with Guang Jung Nim
I went through torture deadly styles I'm the author
Ingested metals, yeah they made me supernova
Triple spinnin kicks, side kicks, and hook kicks
They come much iller, so you must be Masta Killa

[Hook 2X]
It's Afu, change my style, change the weather
It's Afu, change your mind, just too clever
It's Afu, all the weak styles I sever
Combinin two styles on the mic with Masta Killa

[Masta Killa]
The great ones have searched for the righteous data
To show and prove and master the separation of matter
And seein through death, never loose conscious of self
Shed a shell keep it movin factor
Sword swing it to the temple, mental state
Danger chamber, eighth yang slang, Wu-Tang
Train private soldiers in this rap game
Like that Shanghai chinky eyed chick from Bedstuy
Wing Chung from Lafayette, Stuyversant and Malcolm X
Fifty Seven Park, it might spark, it's the heart
One blood cell, featurin Masta Kill
After dark he goes, bust gone, trust none, touch one
Young chun, prodigal son, Killa Bees disease
Home grown, flown from over seas, city under siege
Ya eyes bleed, the weed got 'em red dread
Like spinnin roundhouse kicks to the head, he dead

[Hook 2X]"What he said was so clear, so true, that I had to stop everything
And concentrate on his lessons."

[Afu-Ra]
We need masters in biology, zoology
To overtake, illuminati, trick-knowledgy
Transform, reciprocate your mental state
Now make a date, to overtake your objective
Show that through life, that everything is connected
But not in categories, cause that's the devil's warning
Symbols, of cannibalism, ruin your vision
Then thought formulate in your mind, with no precision

[Goldii Lokks]
We paid a crude price, for what they call life
Dubbed without grief, took him out that night
Some'll ask why, ma say they hate the look in his eyes
Like the child, little omen, they want him crucified
The last on the battlefield, the last alive
Beside, they don't want the African to survive
Sable, the son of Satan was involved in the plot
Legalize the homicide, his soul gon' rot

[Pharoahe Monch]
Yo, they attempted assassination of Mumia Jamal, they set'im up
I come to find out, 2Pac they wet'im up
Pharaohe, standin behind my fuckin curtains
With a double-barrel, rehearsin'
Ready for war now for certain
Uh, biological warfare suits
Black gas masks, black boots, half-assed niggas become troops
My dunns are doper warriors, so prove thee now
Plenty thug niggas are fruity now

[Aceyalone]
Freedom is that cold road seldom traveled, by the multitude
We need to depict to describe it, so that we can cultivate this food
Motivate a few of you fools, regenerate the mood
Free ourselves from mental bondage, free ourselves from Family Feuds
Now follow me through this prophecy, building our colonies
Where our pillars and columns be, bigger than the coliseum
I call 'em like I see 'em, the devil does a devil's dance
They wanna murder Mumia, take action, it's the only chance

[Wise Intelligence]
They tellin' me, son, grab a gun or two, money gonna come to you
Stop rhymin 'bout what white people done to you
Look, burn a blunt or two, screw who you wanna screw
Do what you wanna do and lesson went to you
Kill all that teacher shit, its too much cheese to get
And if Jesus exists, just don't believe in it
Eat the bread of wickedness, join the global Satanists
Give death row sentences to black revolutionists

[Tre Hardson]
Now they will flee and guard, just to feel the power
Not to justify, that of you and I
Holdin' daggers up and lettin' you decide
After passin' information that's falsified
Stand behind a lie, what does it cost to die?
What does it cost to live? Why do they specify?
These terms of why, when they ain't the most high
They fear they will kill, but the soul will never die

[M. Sayyid]
Through seasons, legions and demons, pleadin heathens and even Stevens
I've wandered through regions, cease freezin, even some breathin
Some leave in pieces, will freeze caps, like Clevelands
Now she seemin like semen, slide you home like the decon
Use my mental for potential through Mumia's mind
Behind these bars, diamond scarred for the chorus
I climb all fifty steams and lock cats in Mars like dogs
Fog will clear like tears after resolution
This daily fight through revolution

[Zack de la Rocha]
You see the capital thugs got nervous
Cause he refused to be their servant
Cause he spit truth that shook heads and burn like black churches
Prose and verses, filled with a million black hearses
Watch, see the decision of Dred Scott as it reverses
So as long as their rope is tight around Mumia's neck
Let there be no rich white life we bound to respect
Cause and effect, can you smell the smoke in the breeze?
My Panther, my brother, we are at war until you're free

[Jean Grae]
I plan to move my motherfuckers to the frontline, ready with guns cockin'
We storm prisons, get the wards rockin'
Snipe all the F.B.I. and cops clockin'
Philly officials, bodies droppin'
Offends the eighty-five, bombin'
Eye for an eye, we'll hang 'em by the Capitol Steps
Snap their necks, snatch their vests, equip my children with techs
Free from the protected Feds, called it murder, legal execution shit
Free the righteous or face the bloody revolutionists song

[Tragedy Khadafi]
Yo, federal indictment, militant mind enlightment
Son, we outburst, in the court room, full of excitement
Face the jury, thugged out, with blind fury
They want us all under the jail, end of the story
Brave and heartless, we can have a million marches
But when you black you under attack, son, regardless
Live by the gun, dunn, and die by the gun
And revolutionize minds until freedom one

[Hook: Jean Grae and Chuck D]
Somebody scream bloody murder, inside of my head
The executioner's plot controlled by the feds
Take illegal action, they want Mumia dead
This nation of savages been trying to kill us for years

[Hakim - Channel Live]
Yo, we watch wizards play games in Washington with your life
Swung with Spiderman, now we swing websites
W dot Hell's Kitchen, livin, ill condition
Body clonin switchin C.I.A. lynchin, Mumia trapped in prison
Marilyn Manson, mainstream, aliens visiting
My skin's a misdemean' with siren bee screams
Them wonder why the Live Channel got attitude
The times got us seated like zero degrees latitude

[Tuffy - Channel Live]
Can you keep a secret like society? The eye is on the rooftop
They got me under surveillence, like they had Biggie and 2Pac
Yo, I saw two rocks, heard two shots, then level when my view drops
They grazed me, but didn't phase me, I fired back and hit two cops
For sure I, mumble through the jungle like Indiana Jones
With the key to unlock the science of microphones
Hit reverse, disperse, on stereo, planet Earth
Because the first shall be last, the last shall be first

[Stic.Man - Dead Prez]
Yo, if Mumia dies, fires in the skies, rebel cries
We politicize, brothers with the lies uncovered
Look for me in the whirlwind, dare to struggle and here to win
Long live the panthers, comrades with answers
Freein all political prisoners of war, freein the poor
Open the door, keep your hands off our silence
Stop the 'ism schism prison economy that we live in
Impeach the president, keep on fightin until they give in

[M-1 - Dead Prez]
I say, "Fuck the Police," cause they been killin us for years
This ain't no free country, niggas get murdered for their ideas
Free Mumia means all Africans let go
Cause just livin in the ghetto puts you on death row
You don't know? You seen how the tried to do Assada
Till some real niggas organized theyselves and went and got'er
Lotta crackers verbalize if Mumia dies, put fire in the skies
But only time'll tell the truth from the lies

[Chuck D]
As you peep the illusion, cause I see my peoples losin
The overall battle to keep Republic rats from choosin
Afterall, I feel the bruisin of the constitution
When my back's against the wall, manifestin in their destiny
Shit, they just testin me, Mumia's spirit blessin me
No alibi, I know Allah is not their ally
I believe I can fly, but their type of freedom is a lie
So fuck the government, C.I.A. and F.B.I

[Divine Styler]
In the holy month of Ramadan, doin' time, war and degrees
Within the means of God's speed, feel the supreme penalties
Black non-fiction, remains the weapon of choice
Reject the illusion of justice and white hears the black voice
The passion behind the file, the flesh beyond the bars
Through the spirit of under force, who's deaf and who's cost?
Break the black man down in front of the black fam and all
Guilty as you all, free Mumia Abu-Jamal

[Last Emperor]
Shatan will destroy anything for the right price
In a physical world one man cannot die twice
To the spiritual world your soul cannot fly twice
Yet could this be the second time they crucified Christ?
Ask Ed Asner, the actor, after the execute'im
There will be a peasant uprising like the French Revolution
In conclusion, if you detect evil
Free the voice of the voiceless, defender of oppressed people

[Black Thought]
Check it out, they want us locked down, boxed up in the ground
It's war time now from how the sufferin sound
We deep in the realm, the planet petrified overwhelmed
We all stars livin life out on surveilance film
New World law enforced, mind rape, cerebral holocaust
No escape, fire, fifth burn, the execution date
Shatter, We on the front lines prepare
I want Mumia out the cage the time for action is here

[P.E.A.C.E.]
This is a P.S.A. to the P.S.C. and the P.P.D
Mumia Abu-Jamal must be set free
How would y'all like it if we took it to the streets
In a discrete fashion? Still smashin', underground arsenal of lyricists
Live from death row
We want the voices of the voices fully clothed and ready to go
And if not, you'll witness the largest uprisin' you've even seen befo'
April twenty-fo', nineteen fifty-fo'[Afu-Ra]
Blackie Chan too incredible
Molars crushed it, cause you edible
Pedal to the metal, shine lights up in the ghetto
I'm playin' my voice, on the streets, just like a cello
Modern day Othello, my bello, hell no, will never stop
Wanna get high from my mind? Got them yellow top
Fly around the earth, I'm all polite just like a smack spot
I chop stick it to death, while trynna hit the jackpot
Lyrically open, just like a crack spot

[A-Sun]
Fire burn, call me the solar monk, I got ya
Heated up, sweatin' from the lava
Oozin' out the system, volcanic eruption
I'm a natural disaster, sound clasher
Like stone love, illegal, broadcaster
Just because I spit, other people want
No comp, I don't walk, I stomp
Like ?Ole-Ah-Sah?, fire music, makes me high

[Hook 2X: Perverted Monks]
So what's it gonna be, gonna be
Nigga, back up of me
Steadily, steadily
Locked you like a felony
Readily, readily
Bust shots, that's heavily
Poetry, poetry
Jump off the melody

[Ca-See]
I took change, but gave dollars
My innocense, laid on record
Spillin' sewers per second, plug it in and check it
Thug ride, natural order, of selection
Star child indeed, I heed, the best suggestion
You can bust all your weapons, I take all your shots
Power in my heart, yo, it's too hard to stop
Child, so I'm only takin' steps up
Every day something new when I press my luck

[Respect]
You see a nigga like me, sees all that I be in
This mindstate, illin', drillin', for a schillin'
Yo, I'm fine as a villain, so it's tossed up
We hum bangers at your drums, I'm the cage monk, what?
My focus, on skunk, while my fam set it up
Now I step off and erupt, P-Monks, what I'm ruckus
Spit jewels like fuels, floatin' through exhaust fumes
Wicked with these pens, grab a stick, transcend

[Hook 2X]

[Afu-Ra]
Contested, bust caps, just like a western
Lyrical futuristic, like the Jetsons
My jet suns, spazzle, dazzle you lateral
We bleech through hover crafts for the collateral

[A-Sun]
Like a splish spash, tidal waves are splatterin'
Acid rain at the gathering, I'm traveling
Young master, aqua, and ravel ya
Bounce sparks, soft from my flow, and let it shock ya

[Ca-See]
Feel me now, scorchin' hot, the solar sound
Fire breathin', I'm releasin', lethal pounds
To the brain, information, increasin' pain
You lost in the moment, another man folded

[Respect]
See, what's smashed, mouth tactics, I blast ya cabbage
Spit concrete captures, to, match the masses
Lames, Respect crack back then peel
Gorilla warfare, store lead, like steelAfu: Yo 'Ru
Jeru: Yo whassup?
Afu: Yo, c'mere, c'mere. Yo, let's freak that rhyme we was freakin'
The other night
Jeru: I'm sayin' I'm with it, just set it off
Afu: Yo, after this, there's no turning back
Jeru: I'm saying, just set it off!

[Afu Ra]
Physical paralysis, open your chest like a chalice
MCs couldn't strike movements we wish to brandish
I'm tormentin', mind states lyrical warrior
I flow through, fuck the mic I fuckin' floor ya
Headlocks and armlocks, necks is gettin' broken
No jokin', format'll leave your whole borough smokin'
Fist of five rings, I fling MCs to the gutter
Samurai sharp, more deadly than box-cutters
Ultimate, as I emit your death blow
Perverted Monks, and Jeru with the combo

[Jeru]
Peter Piper picked peppers
And Run rocked rhymes but now he rock hymns
I got G through my meridians
The physical extremities
Indomitable
The spirit can't be broken
But jaws are broken
And even backs are broken
Think you're on point, well let your points of pressure open
Foot and fist got your head hangin' open
The breath rebirth
I damage in the mental and physical universe
You quake the earth when you hit face-first
Brake before it gets worse
But those that thirst for abuse get loose
Cause soon I'll be around that neck tight like a noose
God, show improvement

[Afu Ra]
More strength than the Juggernaut, electric like Magneto
Know you couldn't test Mental, or now the sequel
I slip to the floor for the grapple
I crack your collarbone, while I bust your Adam's apple
Spleens get ripped out the backs of your raps
Broken-down fractions as you start to make actions
It's too elusive, how I'm quicker than Bruce's
Silver surfin', the universe is now its astrological
As I proceed in my vehicle
You can't stop it
Fiber-optic, so you watch it
Sophistry, with so much fury
You can't get with me
Fight scenes are left bloody
Poisonous, taoist
My thoughts make plates shift
Some may call this tectonics
But airwaves from miles I boil by my sonics
It's ironic, got MCs hooked on phonics
So physical styles I construct like bionics

[Jeru]
Displaced joints like Shaolin should not
Furious roundhouses cause bones to splinter
Protect your feet, legs, midsection and neck
Cause I'm here to let you know it's not just on AMPEX
We wrecks, and more than just figuratively
Let it be known that we bringin' it physically
And the effect is bodily harm
No chance to pull your firearm
For the body move swift and the mind stay calm
Ways shift like the moment before the storm
Watch my form
It's deadly
Come to close it could get bloody
And ugly
You think that you could stop me?
Perverted monks, so now we apply pressure
This Stamina's style is iller than its predecessor
Dial witch professor, mix up the elixir
Internal power, MCs we devour[Hook 4X: scratched up samples]
"Poisonous taoist!"
"Afu-Ra!"
"The body of the life force!"

[Afu-Ra]
The body of the life force, scientifical street nigga
I walk with a limp, no pimp sign, I'm an urban gorilla
Rough and rugged, plus I keep it realer than realer
Stomp these streets, I'm known as a mic killer
With vintage lines, that vintage rhyme
Black circles around rap camps, I be the lord of the rhyme
Whose the prettiest, baddest mo'fo, know down
G-O-D, Blackie Chan, watch me shut it down
Incredible, my credit is credibly credible
Put hoes up in the track, like heavy metal do
Cats act up, I hit 'em with the John Woo
Yo, I chop 'em up, hit 'em up, and rip 'em up
The Lion King's in town, boy, it's murder on the sound boy
So line your favorite cottage rappers to sing it
Like Keith Murray; my Def Jams, they will get in ya
I slice and dice my competition like a ninja

[Hook 2X]

[Afu-Ra]
Now let me introduce you, to the man, the myth, the mental
Influential, bi-centinial, lyrical spiritual material
Hittin' you like a literal miracle
Settin' fire to the streets, that's my ritual
Fossils of my rap book, left for anthropoligists
Show 'em how amazing the jazz, I'm blazing the hooks
Heavily heavily, intertwine with the melody
Deadly deadly, kill the tracks with my medly
Give me that mic fool, you only stuntin' and frontin'
Fluffin' and bluffin', and ain't sayin nothing, stop fronting
The way I shoot the gift, I'm sick with this
I make crowds flip, I'm a hip hop therapist
And you can do the hustle, freak ya body, bounce
But I gotta spit fire, so I'm sure to give ya every ounce
I'm worth my weight, and gold and all it's luster
Step up in the place (Woo-Hah) like I'm Busta

[Hook 4X]

[Afu-Ra]
Hold up, wait, the sound's kinda knocking
Dreaded they up in the club, let's get it poppin'
Jolting compositions as if I was a virus
One breath to raise the dead, don't try to ride this
And of course, I take it back to the hood
Afu riggedy Rasta-hood, raw like a porno is
Slim brother, but I dip like a corn fiddle
Trey eight, snubnose, type of flow, get a gun, though
I'm nasty, as a cannibalist
I eat rappers, alive, as if my name was Hannibal, kid
Perverted Monk, medicating in the cut
Flying guillotine raps, aiyo, I cut shit up
Masterin' the art, technique dichotomy
Straight up yo, I'm bout to catch a body like Gotti
At home in my zone, who feel the ecstasy
Explicitly, the lyrical telepathy

[Hook 4X]
