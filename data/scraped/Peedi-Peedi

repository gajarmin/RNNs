[Intro: Peedi Crakk]
WHOOOOOOOOOO!! Now clap for me mami, OH!
Just clap for me mami, JUST BLAZE!
Okay, and Free, okay, yeah (?)
Que tu quieres mujeres, said she blow la-la
FLIPSIDE - and she my baby mama
Get wild! Okay

[Freeway]
Freeway got the hood on smash
Pop in tape, step on gas and get ghost nigga!
Freeway got the club on lock, step on stage
Set it down leave with a broad, check for her age
Post up, fans suffer circle the block
Call the cops - it's the Roc in your area!
Post up, distribute to the block
Freeway move the rocks in your area!
Yeahhhh, Pop tried to shut me down
Cops tried to shut me down, haters wanna hit me up
What? My Glock carry heavy rounds
Mack carry heavy rounds packed in the Chevy truck
What? You better ring the alarm
Before I cock back, dump on you and your boys
And have black suits, tucked on you and your mom
But back to the song, said she wanna suck on me and the boys
Her ass look good in a thong
And she want me to sneak in the building like Trojans in "Troy"
Best believe there's Trojans involved
Hats lift over the boy, oh boy

[Hook: Freeway]
We rip crowds, whole lot of fire and a little bit of bass
Is all it takes to make the place
GET WILD, whole lot of style and a little bit of cake
Is all it takes to make her skate
FLIPSIDE (flipside) crack house and a little bit of bass
Is all it takes to make the block
GET WILD (get wild) park keys and a little bit of cheese
Is all it takes to make her leave

[Peedi Crakk]
With these (triple) O.G.'s
Tell that ho to Tootsie Roll on the pole I'm tryna squeeze
With ease (with ease) then breathe (then breathe)
I ain't Hov', I just know what I know
I'm talkin owe Sparks five, ride for a dollar bill
Famous up in Hollywood, high in them Holly-hills
I, can't deny how the mamis feel
Higher than the cable bill, slide with your baby girl
P. Crakk and I ain't for play
I got a mack that'll change your day
Fall back, get your act intact
P-I-M-P U-P H-O-E-S is all the rest
And yes, this is Philly, you welcome to come check us
Crakk, wherever I holla at be gettin neck in
Pass her the thing, tell her make it go rrrring
The prince of S.P., is soon to be the king
And we..

[Hook]

[Freeway]
Now how many hoes in your motherfuckin group?
Wanna take a ride in my '89 Delt
She felt the kid, thumbtack, held the roof
Up on her cell phone, "Freeway got me in the squadder
He a rider, from the block to the booth"
I'm as, real as they come, the gorillas'll come
Six could chill 'til they come, gotta peel when they done
But let her spend the night, all night
Cause the heat call me a liar
She just like Honey so I called her Mariah
Wanna see, if she got what it takes to carry across state
And travel across state, with things taped to her waist
Mami wanna ride with pa
Bad bitches get scooped like Haagan Daas
And put on the team shoot, put on the Bean bitch
Lean bitch, shoot at they entourage
Hit up the team camp, pull on your jeans bitch

I'm fucking that ho, you loving that bitch
You kissing that whore, she sucking my dick
You giving her checks I'm giving her swag
She'll tell me get her hair done he'll give me it back
He'll give me some cash, he'll give me a whip
I'm about to [?] your ho give me your bitch
Get over here talk money you know it's here
Them diamonds be glowing clear
[?]
If she ain't fucking with me maybe she fucking P
If she ain't fucking with P then she probably fucking with Re
If she ain't fucking Re then it got to be Omelly
I asked him about the bitch he tell me he hit already
I like damn I was loving that
But now I'm fucking that
Donald Daffy ducking that
Pussy be so fucking wet man I get all up in that
As fast as I get up in there I jet just like a fucking leer
Meet her off of the computer she ask me if I know Cooner
And do I be with Karem and I'm like what do you mean
I act like I didn't know them cause I knew if she was going
She tell me they like her brothers
Most likely they probably fuck her
Most likely one of them text her
[?]
I give her back just like money you tuck her like she was profit
Hold up, shout out my nigga Diddy we hit shit
I hit so many hoes I need a hit stick
Hold up Rug give me some T-Pain
So I can get fly on these bitches like [?]
Pradas on v-neck two chains
Louie belt make them little bitches melt
We getting money ball hard top shelf
Got stacks on deck made it all myself
I made it got it and flipped it
Woke up again re-did it
Know look at these bitches they all over a nigga
Tell them stop, watch, Banshee on rock
Fucking up my Pradas going hard no stop
Flying around your way like hater what could you say
Bad bitch on the back, let me tell you about that
First she was fucking Chris now that bitch she was fucking me
[?] she told me that she was sweet
I caught her up in the club my pocket was on dub
My neck it was on bling all I did was one thing
So all y'all niggas that thinking you fuck hoes

For I send Osama to buy your bitch
And if he said that pussy was good then I'mma hit
A dog I'm a bitch

These hoes so sick so crazy
Heard one of them trying to have my baby
I ball Tracy McGrady
Score that bitch get an and one maybe

[Verse 2: Peedi Crack]
It's in my nature to be a player
Pound on her now, growl at her later
I see you pussy and pretty that's all cool
But you ain't fine as the diamonds in my jewels
You want the shoes, Bahamas and cruise
Summer you call your momma and tell her the good news
She want shoes preferably Jeremy Shoes
She think I'm shopping and copping she had too many boos
That girl drunk, though she pass when she flunk
Maybe I had a gas when I said she had a dump
Or maybe I got a trash when I passed her to Skunk
Baby it's been fun and your boy go to run
I got to go lot of x lot of o's
Lot of hugs lot of kiss lot of bad groupie hoes
You already know
Call I never show
Pause hold up, Peedi caught the cheery bow
That's the Lamb, that's probably why he's MIA
And I don't mean Miami he missing in another state
He in some other case let's get it right
He bumped into something new and ooh that coochi tight
I got to tighten up the hat, it's sliding off my gat
It's wet like I just copped the bundle [?]
The girl fresh, what up to Mannie Fresh
And [?] and all my dawgs from the set
Can't forget about Ke, shout out my boy Nickles
My old head G and all of my niggas pickles
My man wall street almost passed out
When he found Peddi was in love with Ms. Chows
[?] block get the Henny out the truck
And go get another [?] cause all the Rose is gone
The Goose is gone the Kettle One is gone
I'm sitting on the hood of my [?]
That's Peedi Cracky half-Black half-Puerto Rican
And when he rap you don't understand what he speaking
Just understand that he be freaking every weekend
Me, Omelly, and Meek in Four Seasons its on[Peedi Crakk]
It's not a game I'm from Philly
Go by the name P, Prizzy Mac Milly
Used to with Young Crizzy in the back rolling on twigs
People wanna know who run with me, nobody but the bang, bang
Streets will forgive me, street vocals searching the city, sing
Peedi, Peedi, I heard that they got your number
The alias you've been living under the mack goes thrriiing
Peedi, Peedi, I heard that they watch your mother
Got a hit on your brother, like motherfucker don't - blliinnk
Crack, smack a tooth out your choppers
Any wrong move, I blast the tool up on you fuckers
Wait, that's just enough for you to follow
Heavyweight rap, I spit for much for you to swallow
Blap, Blap, number one with a bullet
Play with them guns to the fullest
Your stupid ass get, clapped, bap
About my past and my future, you disrespect it, I'll shoot you
Treat it just like that...

[Hook: repeat 2X]
[Peedi C] Now one's for Peedi Crakk
[Freeway] And two's for Free'
[Young C] Three for Young Gunna
[B Sigel] And four for Sig'
[Peedi C] You know it's SP yes we above of those things
First the mack go ring, and when it's done it go ting

[Freeway]
All of the sudden and there's six million ways to rhyme
There's still six million ways to D-I-E
I'll smack your P-Y-T, with the bun and the nine, nigga
I live me rhymes, y'all ain't Free
But y'all know y'all heard of him
Niggas can not serve him, not see him when he floatin' by, windows be dark tinted
Stop playing thinking you touch him, trouble you deep in it
Clock spitting, it's just the principle, my principality
Follow me home, better have a full tank, money for shoes
What you fools think, full bank money from shows
It's the Roc bitch, I'm on your block bitch
I'm in the cock-pit, you think it's a Rolls
So what if it's borrowed from Mac, gotta take it back, back
And gotta bobble the gat, push your shit back, back
Free, house the trap, push the release day back
Me and crack at it again, add it to wax

[Hook]

[Young Chris]
It's not a game I'm from Philly
Go by the name, Young Chris, or Young Gunner
Know my partner Young Neffi, we the youngest out the gang
Mamis spend a lot of meta, man I treat 'em all the same
Closest thing to my thang, is my thang, thang
Niggas they act dumb act they think, thangs
Soon as the crackers come, they hit the bing, and sing
Niggas on the street whisperin', Police District and
Tell them about the drops and when the Puerto Ricans did Shamear
The dough get 'em, about the flow switchin' em
Got the greatest listening, haters 4-5'n them
Blasin' not missin' 'em, LA missin' him
Muhammad thang got his momma thinking that it's cousin Chris and 'em
Though we in a better place, be here, he rather too
But our father, the number when he ready too
Do not bother the rumble, niggas ready too, bang you in a second
Keep the banger for protection

[Hook]

[Beanie Sigel]
It ain't a game I'm from Philly
Go by the name B. Siggy, Mac Milly, Mac Mittens
Broad Street Bully, Mac go fully, bitch
My whole squad sing chiti-bang, bang
Make the city gangbang, stay pop, chain GANG
Y'all ain't said a damn thang, with your thang thangs
Nigga, we can do the damn thang
The war ain't over 'til that fat bitch sang
Or the last bullet from my Mac blaang, mayne
My whole click goin' reign, the half a clip will melt ya
For shelter, don't get caught up in the drizzle
Hit you in the spittle, and then bring it back again
It ain't a thang to make your brains go hang, mayne
Got bitches on the thang, thang
Because they like the way the S.P. chain swings
City of Philly, you know that city brought your city the slang
My squad with me, and they ready to bang, bang

[Hook][Verse 1: Peedi Peedi]
Uh Uh huh Uh Huh Uh
I'll box your fuckin' head off
Who gon' knock the kid off?
None of y'all which one of y'all, come try me
I'll body little homeboy silence that sound boy
Come challenge me please I promise you a homi'
And I'm dipping in a bonnie' and I'm fresh out the county
And I just taught my mami how to shoot a lil' tool
So I hate for you to run up get one up in your stomach
That's one less bullet from my hundred shot uz'
Put your finger in your gun shot wound
Run to spittle and tell 'em P Crack not cool
He on that shit that 'ill make a dead man move
Stop train, airplanes fall dawg you gon' lose
I'm on my twist you on my list
I bring the wop out of the spot it's on like shit
That nigga crack back and I'mma pop off my blick
That nigga Mack back you need to hop off our dicks (BRAATT)

[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel]
Fresh out the federal cases I got several
About four or five just had to settle two
They said I try to show a nigga what the metal do
But didn't succeed the nigga still breath
Told em', please, I would of hit him in his p's
With the Mac with the beam that got back in the breeze
Only clap from the neck up I'd let the heck-lar plug 'em
I don't think they made Kevlar scullys fuck it
I should of let the AR touch him cuffed him
To the bumper drug him two city blocks
The juice in me and the henny shot
Four percs' and a hit of wop
You shoot first if you get the drop
Your deuce work if you hit the spot
Lose the nurse some one get the doc'
Remove his shirt his pressure drop
Check his vital sign his hemorrhaging finish him
FLATLINE

[Hook: Beanie Sigel & Peedi Crack]
Load it up roll up BLAT boy flat boy (flatline)
Slow up all that rap 'ill get that boy clapped boy (flatline)

Paramedics breath over you
Machines gotta breath for you
Your faggot ass squad wouldn't bleed for you
Get flatlined I'm the wrong one
Short temper with a long gun

Niggas snitch when the law come
You better run when the boy come

(Peedi Crack)
RRRRIING!!
P crack'll test his aim on you
B mack just bang on you
Flesh just hang on you
And I don't know what u been told
But when my Mac unload

Got ten shots for the present and the top
Risin' off Porsche eleven about seven stops
Get back on this gat I throw it for my pop
I'm not lying don't get your ass flatline

(Hook)

(FLATLINE SOUND UNTIL THE END)[Intro – Meek Mill]
Meek Mill and Crack Daddy
The heat is automatic
Somebody tell em

[Verse 1 – Peedi Crack]
I’m a trooper, and everything I ride’s super
And my producer, that nigga just flew in from the future
And I’m loose off goose, I’m bout to get looser
And you could catch me in Bermuda moving with a shooter
I’m ready, like Freddy, the fetti [?] heavy
And every 13th of January, van kitty city blowing monkey
Keep it funky when my pockets was boney, I was lonely
But now they husky, I’m hearing donkeys only
Thank you, I came through the venue to entertain you
A shame I had to bring the bang in case I got to bang you
It ain’t too many MCs speaking my lingo
I change so frequent that the flow can’t keep a main ho
I can’t fold, Pay 40 acres in Jamaica
Make a lot of noise and take a lot of sedatives
Ain’t nothing greater, haters play the back of the theater
Players take a bow, flavor by the miles (Ring!)

[Hook – Meek Mill]
I ain’t with that he say she say shit
He say she say she on my dick
Yeah I hear a hater talking but they on my dick
Will shine like the diamonds all on my wrist
Leggo, Leggo, Leggo
I tell them haters
Leggo, Leggo, Leggo
I tell them bitches
Leggo, Leggo, Leggo
I tell them bitches
Leggo, Leggo, Leggo

[Verse 2 – Meek Mill]
First of all, my flavor on ridiculous
D square kicking it, Benji after Benjamins
And every time I meet em they be sweeter than some cinnamon
Cause they know I’m getting it, so they let me swim in it
I eat your pussy if it smell like water
You can say fuck me but don’t fuck my daughter
I ain’t even got one yet, they putting in an order
Trying to get me to hit it raw so they can child support her
Slaughter, rawer than a coke across the border
SS Camero looking like a transformer
You'll catch me in it dipping like I’m De la Hoya
Better yet Mayweather, cause I’m way better
And I don’t save cheddar, I blow it like candles on my birthday
Shawty thirsty, she grabbing on it suck it like she tryna hurt me
I call Omelly, we go party on a Thursday

[Hook]

[Verse 3 – Young Chris]
Hundred thousand dollars worth of diamonds, I be shining
And that nine that I be [?] fitting fine up in the line
Fresh Ferragamo every time when I recline
Sitting higher while they climbing, I don’t lie when I be rhyming
Gucci [?], 2010 signing
Dropped the fourth quarter, Mike Brown put LeBron in
Nigga where your cash at? Your plastic declining
Fresh check out my dresser, fashion designing
Clean cut, coupe cream guts, slight tint
Austere fruity, the steam up
See me get cracked, hog the scene up
Three franchises like Boston teamed up
Have you seen us?
But this is Philadelph, we did it all
You got to load the hitter soft
She got it in we get it all
We don’t even listen to your whack rap nigga
2010 edition of that ratpack nigga

[Hook][Verse 1: Black Thought]
Look - my squad half-Mandrill, half-Mandela
My band about seventy strong just like Fela
Yeah, part Melle-Mel, part Van Halen
And we represent Illadel, where they still rebellin'
Hey yo, sicko show like Mike Moore
My city ain't nothin' like yours
Slippin' into darkness like war
Night crawl with the lights off
You see a lot of life lost for the white horse
Regardless, the charges making us all targets
All on the red carpet, guns from the black market
Who got the politician's in they back pocket
Pimp slap, pump that, give me that profit
When you make contact, give me that gossip
If you break contract, you'll be that hostage
They getting busy and the city is raw
Better deadbolt the door, it ain't safe no more

[Hook: Black Thought (DJ Jazzy Jeff scratches)]
Southside
(Get busy)
Northside
(Get busy)
Westside
(Get busy)
Worldwide
(Get busy) [x4]


[Verse 2: Dice Raw]
Approach with caution, be cautious when talking to bosses
I feel I've been through a metamorphosis
I'm mutated by unknown forces
The feeling of course is
Somethin' that's hard to describe
I'm half-dead, never felt more alive
Reborn, remove the gold coins from my eyes
I've been down, but now I'm back up
I'm about to act up, boy, you better back up
When you see me set up shop, know to pack up
Cause I crack up when a rapper get slapped up
Number one reason y'all should give rap up
Dice, it's mines, I got it all wrapped up
I'm kind of like W.E.B. Du Bois
Meets Heavy D and the Boyz
Smooth as a Rolls Royce
Built like a tank, smokin' on dank
Walkin' through the Guggenheim
Raw Life, Black Inc

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Peedi Peedi]
Now on your mark, get set
Go cop everything you ever heard by P. Crack
Dice Raw and Black
Fuck the Internet
Buy a baseball bat, break a bootlegger leg
All I listen to is vets, you're fresh off the step
I'll come directly at your OG neck
I'm used to the 1-2 check, not the 1-2 step
I'm strapped, I'll leave every cat among you wet
Now let's go, you know I'm politically incorrect
At the show, I start it with a
"Can I get a ho?"
And the ho's go retarded
The po-po tape off the stage for caution
It's bad lands, North Philly get it in
It's Crack man - used to back spin
Now I spend stacks and stacks
And Uncle Sam tryin' to tax all my hard-earned raps
Damn, we making yens, pesos, euros - we representin'

[Hook][Rell]

Have you niggas shittin' puss
Bleedin' through the ass
C'll seize a nigga fast
Hit you bitches up

[Hook: Peedi Crakk and Young Chris]
PC: We want, we want the kid that shot that B.B. Gun

[Verse 2: Neef]
Whoo whoop Bucky
Yo, bang bang here we go

Don't tempt me nigga, I'm gonna shoot it
Trust nigga, you gonna come up missing about mine
Thirty shot MP5, spit out nines
All hollows in ya gut
So you holla when it cuts
Let off a dime, then I calm
20 shots'll follow up
You'll be sparking like a dutch
Keep the shit up on a hush
Out on bail, fresh outta jail
Two cases, I got to fight nigga
They sent me down try to right niggas
They want me up north, stressing with them White niggas
Getting husky, fuck it let twelve judge me
Got to keep it on me daily
If you got some beef you smell me
Listen what you niggas tell me, come out naked
So I can be in the spittle, doc pumping I'm wetted
But I'mma be both these fuckas give me a second

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Beanie Sigel]
Sig. want Sig. want you bitch niggas still pumping you guns
Like pump pellets won't puncture your lungs
Get your toes tagged who wanna slow drag
Dance with the devil who wanna play freeze tag with the metal
And you it's like a virus my whole crew sick
I'm the truth in the booth with my all blue kicks
But tell me why you mad dude like Big Old skits mitts
Yea they call me that throwback kid
Cause that colt four fifth put big holes and shit
And you know I keep my ruger near
My back pocket keep the two shot there
Line up who wanna see if 2Pac dead
You'll knocked out ya tube socks yea
Get your wing tell me thing 2Pac said
Until the STOP you niggas not PAC

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Oschino]
Oschino, nigga, SP
We want we want
That boy in the Porsche with the top in the trunk
Oschino long like joker clip all hanging out
Money over bitches what this SP gang about
Bought it like brotha man gas like son of Sam
One through your face leave your stretched like a rubber band
You wouldn't understand you don't want it fam
The MC with the hammer have yall niggas do the running man
Born in the ghetto straight form the projects
Game like LeBron James but no Nike contract
Pitbull red nose six hundred all gold marshland all froze
Low top red holes red shoe strings no socks on
Mr. Matinee be moving that popcorn
Yall niggas should stop drawing your oil paintings stink
While we in the kitchen cookin oils till they stink

[Hook]

[Outro: Peedi Crakk &Young Chris]
YC: Chitty bang bang all I see in the ghetto is thangs bang
YC: Bitches getting drunk and wetted and settle for gang bang
YC: Bitch niggas live for what they copy and never
YC: Is it just me or do you agree things change
YC: Yea...Young Gunnas...Chris and Neef

YC: Get it right nigga
PC: We want, we want the kid that shot that B.B. Gun[Verse 1: Young Chris]
Criminal background, State Prop's back now
Lookin' for a squad like ours, picture that clown
Difference in them verses what we talk we live it too
They just beats and hooks far from lyrical
Just a lil' piece of mind I thought I'd share with you
They don't really care for you
Be a lil' careful, you
Might think you sharin' ya shit
And the weirdest shit
Then next time you hear his shit
You hearin' you
That just let's me know I'm gift with the lyrics too
While I don't take it personal
Reverse em' when they share with you
Keep her near you, unless you sharin'
Cuz I party mines
Sippin' on my name while you lames drinks Bacardi lime
I'm takin' brains for the game when it's party time
Thinkin' you here to hang with the gang?
Well I'm sorry ma
Go ahead ma, keep ya ol' man Chris
Not Ronnie, ain't no old man shit
Plus you know this

[Hook: Peedi Crakk]
Criminals grindin', you hear us rhymin'
But at the same time nines is in alignment
State Prop, a problem try to hide ya diamonds
As if Peedi and them Youngins won't find em
As if B. Sig and Freeweez ain't behind em
Omilio Sparks and Oschin, perfect timin'
We criminal background, we back now
So lemme see ya motherfuckin' diamonds, diamonds..
[Verse 2: Peedi Crakk]
Now...
Know Crakk pick up on em bitches like Chevys
Got my Avalanche tinted, know who in it P and Leslie (P and Leslie)
Blowin',???? then he passed it to Haniffy
Tell me Crakk is off his grindin'
I'm in the heaviest weight class ho
C.R.E.A.M's say blast
Got a camera in my bathroom lookin' at ya ass
Know my whirl-a-frame playin' too bout to break fast
Get a half, while my nigga Tommy Buttas do the math (do the math)
It's like a capsule, you can see it from the past
From the way they call me Crakk, from upstate I'm countin' cash
From Montgomery's ave
I might blast you, look at my lap, I'm in the cashew jag
The girls feel so good, but the brain is not ready, I don't know
I'd rather talk to a woman, cuz their mind is so steady, now here we go

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Young Chris]
I undastand that the ROC a crowded family
But I gotta lotta family
And I'm one of the hottest
I know the fans runnin' to cop us
Will need that jam that have Def Jam want em to drop us
Can't none of them stop us, one in the top plus
Ya don't really live it ya'll runnin' the blockbust
They get it from the flicks (watchin' too many movies)
Now watch them cameras
If they don't get it from a snitch, they get it from the flicks
I limit on these chicks, a condom when I get head
Ever since they told me you could get it from the lips
I never hadda pops, I can get it from some shit
Used to get it on the strip, or they get it from the clips

[Hook]

[Outro: Young Chris]
Young C!.....P.C.!
Chad West, yous a problem!

None of y'all which one of y'all, come try me
I'll body little homeboy silence that sound boy
Come challenge me please I promise you a homi'
And I'm dipping in a bonnie' and I'm fresh out the county
And I just taught my mami how to shoot a lil' tool
So I hate for you to run up get one up in your stomach
That's one less bullet from my hundred shot uz'
Put your finger in your gun shot wound
Run to spittle and tell 'em P Crack not cool
He on that shit that 'ill make a dead man move
Stop train, airplanes fall dawg you gon' lose
I'm on my twist you on my list
I bring the wop out of the spot it's on like shit
That nigga crack back and I'mma pop off my blick
That nigga Mack back you need to hop off our dicks (BRAATT)

[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel]
Fresh out the federal cases I got several
About four or five just had to settle two
They said I try to show a nigga what the metal do
But didn't succeed the nigga still breath
Told em', please, I would of hit him in his p's
With the Mac with the beam that got back in the breeze
Only clap from the neck up I'd let the heck-lar plug 'em
I don't think they made Kevlar scullys fuck it
I should of let the AR touch him cuffed him
To the bumper drug him two city blocks
The juice in me and the henny shot
Four percs' and a hit of wop
You shoot first if you get the drop
Your deuce work if you hit the spot
Lose the nurse some one get the doc'
Remove his shirt his pressure drop
Check his vital sign his hemorrhaging finish him
FLATLINE

[Hook: Beanie Sigel & Peedi Crack]
Load it up roll up BLAT boy flat boy (flatline)
Slow up all that rap 'ill get that boy clapped boy (flatline)
Oh no here we go another (flatline)

(Beanie Sigel)
B seig'll squeeze the eag' on you
P crack let the Mack rrring on you
Paramedics breath over you
Machines gotta breath for you
Your faggot ass squad wouldn't bleed for you
Get flatlined I'm the wrong one
Short temper with a long gun
My blick longer that a W.I.C. line
Niggas snitch when the law come
You better run when the boy come

(Peedi Crack)
RRRRIING!!
P crack'll test his aim on you
B mack just bang on you
Flesh just hang on you
And I don't know what u been told
But when my Mac unload

Got ten shots for the present and the top
Risin' off Porsche eleven about seven stops
Get back on this gat I throw it for my pop
I'm not lying don't get your ass flatline

(Hook)

(FLATLINE SOUND UNTIL THE END)[Intro: Peedi Crakk]
WHOOOOOOOOOO!! Now clap for me mami, OH!
Just clap for me mami, JUST BLAZE!
Okay, and Free, okay, yeah (?)
Que tu quieres mujeres, said she blow la-la
FLIPSIDE - and she my baby mama
Get wild! Okay

[Freeway]
Freeway got the hood on smash
Pop in tape, step on gas and get ghost nigga!
Freeway got the club on lock, step on stage
Set it down leave with a broad, check for her age
Post up, fans suffer circle the block
Call the cops - it's the Roc in your area!
Post up, distribute to the block
Freeway move the rocks in your area!
Yeahhhh, Pop tried to shut me down
Cops tried to shut me down, haters wanna hit me up
What? My Glock carry heavy rounds
Mack carry heavy rounds packed in the Chevy truck
What? You better ring the alarm
Before I cock back, dump on you and your boys
And have black suits, tucked on you and your mom
But back to the song, said she wanna suck on me and the boys
Her ass look good in a thong
And she want me to sneak in the building like Trojans in "Troy"
Best believe there's Trojans involved
Hats lift over the boy, oh boy

[Hook: Freeway]
We rip crowds, whole lot of fire and a little bit of bass
Is all it takes to make the place
GET WILD, whole lot of style and a little bit of cake
Is all it takes to make her skate
FLIPSIDE (flipside) crack house and a little bit of bass
Is all it takes to make the block
GET WILD (get wild) park keys and a little bit of cheese
Is all it takes to make her leave

[Peedi Crakk]
With these (triple) O.G.'s
Tell that ho to Tootsie Roll on the pole I'm tryna squeeze
With ease (with ease) then breathe (then breathe)
I ain't Hov', I just know what I know
I'm talkin owe Sparks five, ride for a dollar bill
Famous up in Hollywood, high in them Holly-hills
I, can't deny how the mamis feel
Higher than the cable bill, slide with your baby girl
P. Crakk and I ain't for play
I got a mack that'll change your day
Fall back, get your act intact
P-I-M-P U-P H-O-E-S is all the rest
And yes, this is Philly, you welcome to come check us
Crakk, wherever I holla at be gettin neck in
Pass her the thing, tell her make it go rrrring
The prince of S.P., is soon to be the king
And we..

[Hook]

[Freeway]
Now how many hoes in your motherfuckin group?
Wanna take a ride in my '89 Delt
She felt the kid, thumbtack, held the roof
Up on her cell phone, "Freeway got me in the squadder
He a rider, from the block to the booth"
I'm as, real as they come, the gorillas'll come
Six could chill 'til they come, gotta peel when they done
But let her spend the night, all night
Cause the heat call me a liar
She just like Honey so I called her Mariah
Wanna see, if she got what it takes to carry across state
And travel across state, with things taped to her waist
Mami wanna ride with pa
Bad bitches get scooped like Haagan Daas
And put on the team shoot, put on the Bean bitch
Lean bitch, shoot at they entourage
Hit up the team camp, pull on your jeans bitch

[Hook][Verse 1: Black Thought]
Look - my squad half-Mandrill, half-Mandela
My band about seventy strong just like Fela
Yeah, part Melle-Mel, part Van Halen
And we represent Illadel, where they still rebellin'
Hey yo, sicko show like Mike Moore
My city ain't nothin' like yours
Slippin' into darkness like war
Night crawl with the lights off
You see a lot of life lost for the white horse
Regardless, the charges making us all targets
All on the red carpet, guns from the black market
Who got the politician's in they back pocket
Pimp slap, pump that, give me that profit
When you make contact, give me that gossip
If you break contract, you'll be that hostage
They getting busy and the city is raw
Better deadbolt the door, it ain't safe no more

[Hook: Black Thought (DJ Jazzy Jeff scratches)]
Southside
(Get busy)
Northside
(Get busy)
Westside
(Get busy)
Worldwide
(Get busy) [x4]


[Verse 2: Dice Raw]
Approach with caution, be cautious when talking to bosses
I feel I've been through a metamorphosis
I'm mutated by unknown forces
The feeling of course is
Somethin' that's hard to describe
I'm half-dead, never felt more alive
Reborn, remove the gold coins from my eyes
I've been down, but now I'm back up
I'm about to act up, boy, you better back up
When you see me set up shop, know to pack up
Cause I crack up when a rapper get slapped up
Number one reason y'all should give rap up
Dice, it's mines, I got it all wrapped up
I'm kind of like W.E.B. Du Bois
Meets Heavy D and the Boyz
Smooth as a Rolls Royce
Built like a tank, smokin' on dank
Walkin' through the Guggenheim
Raw Life, Black Inc

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Peedi Peedi]
Now on your mark, get set
Go cop everything you ever heard by P. Crack
Dice Raw and Black
Fuck the Internet
Buy a baseball bat, break a bootlegger leg
All I listen to is vets, you're fresh off the step
I'll come directly at your OG neck
I'm used to the 1-2 check, not the 1-2 step
I'm strapped, I'll leave every cat among you wet
Now let's go, you know I'm politically incorrect
At the show, I start it with a
"Can I get a ho?"
And the ho's go retarded
The po-po tape off the stage for caution
It's bad lands, North Philly get it in
It's Crack man - used to back spin
Now I spend stacks and stacks
And Uncle Sam tryin' to tax all my hard-earned raps
Damn, we making yens, pesos, euros - we representin'

[Hook][Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I'm fucking that ho, you loving that bitch
You kissing that whore, she sucking my dick
You giving her checks I'm giving her swag
She'll tell me get her hair done he'll give me it back
He'll give me some cash, he'll give me a whip
I'm about to [?] your ho give me your bitch
Get over here talk money you know it's here
Them diamonds be glowing clear
[?]
If she ain't fucking with me maybe she fucking P
If she ain't fucking with P then she probably fucking with Re
If she ain't fucking Re then it got to be Omelly
I asked him about the bitch he tell me he hit already
I like damn I was loving that
But now I'm fucking that
Donald Daffy ducking that
Pussy be so fucking wet man I get all up in that
As fast as I get up in there I jet just like a fucking leer
Meet her off of the computer she ask me if I know Cooner
And do I be with Karem and I'm like what do you mean
I act like I didn't know them cause I knew if she was going
She tell me they like her brothers
Most likely they probably fuck her
Most likely one of them text her
[?]
I give her back just like money you tuck her like she was profit
Hold up, shout out my nigga Diddy we hit shit
I hit so many hoes I need a hit stick
Hold up Rug give me some T-Pain
So I can get fly on these bitches like [?]
Pradas on v-neck two chains
Louie belt make them little bitches melt
We getting money ball hard top shelf
Got stacks on deck made it all myself
I made it got it and flipped it
Woke up again re-did it
Know look at these bitches they all over a nigga
Tell them stop, watch, Banshee on rock
Fucking up my Pradas going hard no stop
Flying around your way like hater what could you say
Bad bitch on the back, let me tell you about that
First she was fucking Chris now that bitch she was fucking me
[?] she told me that she was sweet
I caught her up in the club my pocket was on dub
My neck it was on bling all I did was one thing
So all y'all niggas that thinking you fuck hoes
Like the DJ Boo slow your roll
For I send Osama to buy your bitch
And if he said that pussy was good then I'mma hit
A dog I'm a bitch

She said that I don't like them skinny I like them hoes with [?]
[?] and did you like Chris Paul
You hit it in one night and told her to get lost
Shout out my nigga Dean shout out my nigga Lean
I tell him about a bitch he pull up on the screen
I say I got that pick she send that shit to me
[?] 22 my shit 10-23
These hoes so sick so crazy
Heard one of them trying to have my baby
I ball Tracy McGrady
Score that bitch get an and one maybe

[Verse 2: Peedi Crack]
It's in my nature to be a player
Pound on her now, growl at her later
I see you pussy and pretty that's all cool
But you ain't fine as the diamonds in my jewels
You want the shoes, Bahamas and cruise
Summer you call your momma and tell her the good news
She want shoes preferably Jeremy Shoes
She think I'm shopping and copping she had too many boos
That girl drunk, though she pass when she flunk
Maybe I had a gas when I said she had a dump
Or maybe I got a trash when I passed her to Skunk
Baby it's been fun and your boy go to run
I got to go lot of x lot of o's
Lot of hugs lot of kiss lot of bad groupie hoes
You already know
Call I never show
Pause hold up, Peedi caught the cheery bow
That's the Lamb, that's probably why he's MIA
And I don't mean Miami he missing in another state
He in some other case let's get it right
He bumped into something new and ooh that coochi tight
I got to tighten up the hat, it's sliding off my gat
It's wet like I just copped the bundle [?]
The girl fresh, what up to Mannie Fresh
And [?] and all my dawgs from the set
Can't forget about Ke, shout out my boy Nickles
My old head G and all of my niggas pickles
My man wall street almost passed out
When he found Peddi was in love with Ms. Chows
[?] block get the Henny out the truck
And go get another [?] cause all the Rose is gone
The Goose is gone the Kettle One is gone
I'm sitting on the hood of my [?]
That's Peedi Cracky half-Black half-Puerto Rican
And when he rap you don't understand what he speaking
Just understand that he be freaking every weekend
Me, Omelly, and Meek in Four Seasons its on[Intro: Meek Mill]
Stop playing with these niggas get on that grimy shit
Let them know its still Meek Milly nigga
Heard that

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Old money new work
You can smell the crack aroma on my new shirt
One shooter two hearse
Did them dirty put them niggas on the news first
Niggas think because I'm rapping I won't slide up on them niggas with that ratchet
What's happening
When them windows roll down and them matics get to cracking
Most of you pussy ass niggas get to ratting
Consequences make them feel the drum
A nigga rob me and we gon' kill his mom
That's real talk get on that grimy shit
Shout out to [?]
I tell him pass it off and he gon' pass it off
And when it come to questions he won't ask at all
I get you everything [?]
My youngins from the northside they won't stop until your casket fall
Do you really want that
About that paper my nigga Oschi will be at your front step
That's how a hitta get it though
About that money my nigga CP be in your window
And Omelly be at your bitch spot
With a big Glock trying to get the big drop
Plotting on you as the time goes tick tock
Soon as you come get the pussy you gon' catch a headshot

[Verse 2: Peedi Crakk]
Aww yes
Fuck around lay around
Play around watch the waiter boy lay it down
You the best say it now I don't think so
Don't let the pride weigh you down you gon' sink slow
Checking my fresh you should be checking bank rolls
Why should I stress my check is in the bank yo
[?] blowing in the wind through the window
I'm really that nigga to fuck without a tempo
I'm in a sauna climbing a llama
My baby momma trying to figure out if I'm in some drama
I'm sleeping on top of the covers
Locks on the shutter
I'm going through she wondering why won't I fuck her
I'm getting [?]
Candy painted the Lac black jelly bean
Black hoodies and skullys wiggles in the cellophane
Roll up puff and pass it
Tuck the ratchet
[?]
Five be in your area
War be at your front door causing mass hysteria
Ring Peedi in your mother's house
Second floor back room trying to check your brother out
Blow [?]
Chilling in your drive way peeling out pronto
Skrrrr first we grip CL
Straight to the condo everything DL

[Verse 3: Shizz Nitty]
When I get my tag on I put that mask on
Still ride or die [?] drag on
Used to run it in plenty grams it would add on
Drake shit best had 40 in my jet lag
You just know you're rolling play your part just like a step dad
Pace him with a glizzy got a shot like Travis Bess had
Don't worry if that tec jam up
I will run up on the groom then hit the best man up
See I put that on my glizzy I'll get them all touched
Them niggas come in packs then we hit them all up
See my youngin had a dream with a bird in it
SK shoot had the curb chipping
Diesel and the syrup sipping
[?] had the hood in the frenzy
[?] at the shootouts good with the semi
Out of town make a presence when I'm not around
There's no cause they clip up and ride around
My nigga Doc be at your mom crib
My nigga Wiz be at your mom crib
That nigga Snoop be at your mom crib
Neighbors looking like what the fuck did your mom did
With that Parabellum nine hollows let them all go
Run this shit like Marlow
Spark that man like Waldo
[?][Intro: Peedi Crakk]
Hot shyt, hot shyt, come and get it, come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt

[Verse One: Peedi Crakk]
Come and get it, I don't know what the fuck to do wit it
I wrote it down, took it to the studio and spit it
I tried to knock it in the game, a soccer, they ain't kick it
I twist it up in the dutch, mental lit it and hit it
My girl won't lick it, my moms won't cook it
The cops won't book it, my squad ain't wit it
I shot a point black where the cage is still live in
I try to take it to Jamal and pray that they'll send us
Playa plies won't rip it, icepicks won't pick it
I took it to Jigga, he couldn't do nuttin wit it
I threw it in the river, motherfuckers started swimmin
I bagged it up, put it on the block and couldn't flip
Who the fuck gon' buy it? The Roc won't drop it
Maybe if I put up "For Sale" sign, somebody cop it
State penitentiary cellblocks can't lock it
Hot shyt, bitch, DJ Screw can't +Chop+ it

[Hook: Peedi Crakk]
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt

[Verse Two: Black Thought]
Uh! Come and get it, who want it I got it I'm runnin with it
I brung it from Philly Philly where the crimes get committed
Them rhymes is terrific, beyond scientific
I took it up in a gym, nobody couldn't lift it
Where the hell I'm 'gon send it? Will people 'gon dig it?
I took it to Rich he said it's somethin wrong with it
He took ut to ?uestlove, he on the phone with it
He took it to Pitchfork, he couldn't get a sentence
Who the fuck 'gon touch it? If Snoop won't puff it?
The streets don't love it, your peeps won't plug it
I took it to Jigga he said it wasn't in the budget
We took it to Jazzy Jeff, the brother couldn't cut it
I wonder who 'gon knock it, the world 'gon rock it
The squad 'gon pop it, your girl 'gon jock it
I lost my wallet, glad I had it in my pocket
When I'm up in the party, come and see me get retarded HOT!!!!

[Hook: Peedi Crakk]
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt

[Verse Three: Tuphace]
Yo, come and get it, I admit it, I spit it kinda diff-er-ent
They, try to put me in the box, I wouldn't fit in it
Coke - wasn't shippin it, dro - wasn't hittin it
But flippin them downloads and folks stay clickin it
Labels won't push it, T-Pain won't hook it
{?} campaign, straight George Bush it
Showed it to John McCain, said it wasn't crooked
Opened the champagne when Obama ran and took it
The kids won't heat it, the blogs gon' delete it
I sent it to L.A., the nigga couldn't +Reid+ it
I gave it to MJ and my homie couldn't +Beat It+ (Hee-hee!)
I showed it to Stevie and he said he couldn't see it
Where the hell I'm gon' spread it? My city don't get it
The radio gon' edit, the journalists won't sweat it
Dig it, I don't give a SHIT about a critic
I'm young, fresh, and gifted and I spit it how I live it
Come and get it!

[Hook: Peedi Crakk]
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt

[Verse Four: Young Chris]
Uh! My pops wouldn't raise it, Just won't +Blaze+ it
Judge wouldn't free it, Charles couldn't see it
And even if they had the horiscope they couldn't read it
He took it upon his self since Def Jam won't release it
Said the artist couldn't paint it, a poet couldn't speak it
Bullet couldn't seek it bad karma couldn't reap it
Said the farmer couldn't grow it, the cleaners couldn't sew it
Johnny Depp couldn't +Blow+ it, B.E.T. wouldn't show it
Said the law couldn't cuff it, my lungs wouldn't puff it
Tone couldn't +touch+ it even the phone couldn't crush it
Said a holster couldn't tuck it Superhead can't suck it
It's born to rock on, explosion, one of the toughest
Said the barber couldn't cut it, rain couldn't flood it
McCain can't beat us so Barack had to lead us
It's the Roc motherfuckers, G-shots, undefeated
This flow is so insane T-Wayne Couldn't Believe it
MOTHERFUCKERS!!!!!!!

[Hook: Peedi Crakk]
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt

[Verse Five: Wale]
(Kill it!) Okay, Peedi said kill it, euthanasia's in the building
And Wale been on his business since Gang of Six kill it
The people gon' feel it, a leader win the building
A leader to my people, niggas hate it just a smidget
The city can't stop it, no keys gon' lock it
Believe I been popular, the freaks who been pockin
The beggars can't borrow, the record sales drop
And name another new nigga wit a sicker Twitter follow
And the politics are part of it, the radio ain't on it
Promoters say that most of them are 'fraid of my performance
I'm flawless wit the spittin, the rappers don't live it
My YSL lenses, my infrared sixes
My infrared maxes and I ain't even matchin
So gonna bring the bitches, and Peedi bring the Backwoods
And I'mma get some action, who said I won't do it?
I'mma take you out the game, you +Mutombo+ to it
Muthafucka!!!

[Hook: Peedi Crakk]
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt[Intro – Meek Mill]
Meek Mill and Crack Daddy
The heat is automatic
Somebody tell em

[Verse 1 – Peedi Crack]
I’m a trooper, and everything I ride’s super
And my producer, that nigga just flew in from the future
And I’m loose off goose, I’m bout to get looser
And you could catch me in Bermuda moving with a shooter
I’m ready, like Freddy, the fetti [?] heavy
And every 13th of January, van kitty city blowing monkey
Keep it funky when my pockets was boney, I was lonely
But now they husky, I’m hearing donkeys only
Thank you, I came through the venue to entertain you
A shame I had to bring the bang in case I got to bang you
It ain’t too many MCs speaking my lingo
I change so frequent that the flow can’t keep a main ho
I can’t fold, Pay 40 acres in Jamaica
Make a lot of noise and take a lot of sedatives
Ain’t nothing greater, haters play the back of the theater
Players take a bow, flavor by the miles (Ring!)

[Hook – Meek Mill]
I ain’t with that he say she say shit
He say she say she on my dick
Yeah I hear a hater talking but they on my dick
Will shine like the diamonds all on my wrist
Leggo, Leggo, Leggo
I tell them haters
Leggo, Leggo, Leggo
I tell them bitches
Leggo, Leggo, Leggo
I tell them bitches
Leggo, Leggo, Leggo

[Verse 2 – Meek Mill]
First of all, my flavor on ridiculous
D square kicking it, Benji after Benjamins
And every time I meet em they be sweeter than some cinnamon
Cause they know I’m getting it, so they let me swim in it
I eat your pussy if it smell like water
You can say fuck me but don’t fuck my daughter
I ain’t even got one yet, they putting in an order
Trying to get me to hit it raw so they can child support her
Slaughter, rawer than a coke across the border
SS Camero looking like a transformer
You'll catch me in it dipping like I’m De la Hoya
Better yet Mayweather, cause I’m way better
And I don’t save cheddar, I blow it like candles on my birthday
Shawty thirsty, she grabbing on it suck it like she tryna hurt me
I call Omelly, we go party on a Thursday

[Hook]

[Verse 3 – Young Chris]
Hundred thousand dollars worth of diamonds, I be shining
And that nine that I be [?] fitting fine up in the line
Fresh Ferragamo every time when I recline
Sitting higher while they climbing, I don’t lie when I be rhyming
Gucci [?], 2010 signing
Dropped the fourth quarter, Mike Brown put LeBron in
Nigga where your cash at? Your plastic declining
Fresh check out my dresser, fashion designing
Clean cut, coupe cream guts, slight tint
Austere fruity, the steam up
See me get cracked, hog the scene up
Three franchises like Boston teamed up
Have you seen us?
But this is Philadelph, we did it all
You got to load the hitter soft
She got it in we get it all
We don’t even listen to your whack rap nigga
2010 edition of that ratpack nigga

[Hook][Verse 1]
Can't stop, in this to win this
Bad boy, Dennis the Menace[Verse 1 – Young Chris]
Heart as cold as December
Shells hot as the devil
I supply their syringes to survive in the ghetto
Survival of the fittest, itchy finger for triggers
Sticky fingers, [?], we hittas
Best women in tropic, just a hella exotic
You can smell in my pocket, run and tell em I got it
Count the clock on the cola just to sprinkle a soda
Hoes silly, embrace em, like to know you the soldier
Two [?]  to blow, I’m ready to go if them niggas approach me
The watches and cars, they watching us sauce
So I sleep with it closely
Yeah, sleeping with nina, threesome with dezi
Orgasm, they get to busting, when leaving em deadly
I’m ready to go, he’s ready to blow, my nigga he’s busting
I murdered the comp, he’s better then who?
My nigga you’re bugging, wing a hawk and we thugging
36 in the oven, got em pitching and hugging, fiends stick it and puff it
Lord now we grubbing, and we flipping the water
Getting richer than porter, and I’m hitting their daughters
Niggas ain’t wishing me luck, niggas wish me to die
Kid niggas alive
Cousin on mint leaf, uncle on crack rock
Brother in the jail cell, youngins on the back block
Giving no warnings, been in the corner with my gat got
Lil clown, fuck your full pound when that mac chop

[Verse 2 – Peedi Crack]
Sky blue one time slide through, it’s grey now
Stop and frisk, lay his face down like any day now
Liquor, drugs, and strip clubs, this is the devil’s playground
I intentionally enter, my inner wishes is vague now
Could be loud as a K round, make your heart skip a tempo
Leave the room in disarray, just bill me the incidentals
Got to switch up the rental, my appointment’s in pencil
30 extension, and turning the [?]
I’m just Peedi, I can’t be what you perceive me
To be, or what you see and believe on your TV
I’m iller than watching thriller in 3d
See me still chilling with my nigga C, it’s still SP
Feeling like a million, fuck these niggas, RIP
Buck niggas out they seat
Fucking with the black and latin master P
Bout it bout, shot it cause I’m proud about it
Faggots hopping out the closet
Lifestyle out of pocket[Peedi Crakk]
It's not a game I'm from Philly
Go by the name P, Prizzy Mac Milly
Used to with Young Crizzy in the back rolling on twigs
People wanna know who run with me, nobody but the bang, bang
Streets will forgive me, street vocals searching the city, sing
Peedi, Peedi, I heard that they got your number
The alias you've been living under the mack goes thrriiing
Peedi, Peedi, I heard that they watch your mother
Got a hit on your brother, like motherfucker don't - blliinnk
Crack, smack a tooth out your choppers
Any wrong move, I blast the tool up on you fuckers
Wait, that's just enough for you to follow
Heavyweight rap, I spit for much for you to swallow
Blap, Blap, number one with a bullet
Play with them guns to the fullest
Your stupid ass get, clapped, bap
About my past and my future, you disrespect it, I'll shoot you
Treat it just like that...

[Hook: repeat 2X]
[Peedi C] Now one's for Peedi Crakk
[Freeway] And two's for Free'
[Young C] Three for Young Gunna
[B Sigel] And four for Sig'
[Peedi C] You know it's SP yes we above of those things
First the mack go ring, and when it's done it go ting

[Freeway]
All of the sudden and there's six million ways to rhyme
There's still six million ways to D-I-E
I'll smack your P-Y-T, with the bun and the nine, nigga
I live me rhymes, y'all ain't Free
But y'all know y'all heard of him
Niggas can not serve him, not see him when he floatin' by, windows be dark tinted
Stop playing thinking you touch him, trouble you deep in it
Clock spitting, it's just the principle, my principality
Follow me home, better have a full tank, money for shoes
What you fools think, full bank money from shows
It's the Roc bitch, I'm on your block bitch
I'm in the cock-pit, you think it's a Rolls
So what if it's borrowed from Mac, gotta take it back, back
And gotta bobble the gat, push your shit back, back
Free, house the trap, push the release day back
Me and crack at it again, add it to wax

[Hook]

[Young Chris]
It's not a game I'm from Philly
Go by the name, Young Chris, or Young Gunner
Know my partner Young Neffi, we the youngest out the gang
Mamis spend a lot of meta, man I treat 'em all the same
Closest thing to my thang, is my thang, thang
Niggas they act dumb act they think, thangs
Soon as the crackers come, they hit the bing, and sing
Niggas on the street whisperin', Police District and
Tell them about the drops and when the Puerto Ricans did Shamear
The dough get 'em, about the flow switchin' em
Got the greatest listening, haters 4-5'n them
Blasin' not missin' 'em, LA missin' him
Muhammad thang got his momma thinking that it's cousin Chris and 'em
Though we in a better place, be here, he rather too
But our father, the number when he ready too
Do not bother the rumble, niggas ready too, bang you in a second
Keep the banger for protection

[Hook]

[Beanie Sigel]
It ain't a game I'm from Philly
Go by the name B. Siggy, Mac Milly, Mac Mittens
Broad Street Bully, Mac go fully, bitch
My whole squad sing chiti-bang, bang
Make the city gangbang, stay pop, chain GANG
Y'all ain't said a damn thang, with your thang thangs
Nigga, we can do the damn thang
The war ain't over 'til that fat bitch sang
Or the last bullet from my Mac blaang, mayne
My whole click goin' reign, the half a clip will melt ya
For shelter, don't get caught up in the drizzle
Hit you in the spittle, and then bring it back again
It ain't a thang to make your brains go hang, mayne
Got bitches on the thang, thang
Because they like the way the S.P. chain swings
City of Philly, you know that city brought your city the slang
My squad with me, and they ready to bang, bang

[Hook][Freeway]
Za-za za-za-za za-za

[Omillio Sparks]
I gotta snap on this one daddy!!

[Peedi Crakk]
Oh! Now clap for me mami...
Just clap for me mami...

[Freeway]
I know a little bit
I only know the dirty words...

[Peedi Crakk]
Holla at yo fuckin dog!
No benz, No ice, just me in the hooptie
Holdin the toolie, everything calm and cooly
Got all these chicks tryin to screw me
Gimmie the coochie, sperm runnin all down her Guccis
Alot changed since smoke in the crime
Holdin my mama in the court sayin "Fuck you ya honor!"
Fitted, fresh, jersey as well
Rocafella Nam'sayin on my black and white shells
In too deep, niggas still got beef
Still smack you wit the heat, in the middle of the streets
Still, wearin my best wit a fresh white tee
Four-pound, two-clips, hollow tips gone skeet you
So sweet, that I don't lose no sleep
Miss no meals, this guy eats without no deal
Drink liquor like a pirate tongue, slick as a sailor
High like a pilot shirt, foot like a seller, whoa!!
Drinkin liquor gettin' brain in my waterbed
Feelin' like a skylark next to your daughter head
Oh I forgot, bigga nigga probably bought her here
Got her drunk, talkin all the shit a whore wanna hear
I just, fuck em', buck em' wit the lights on
Let her know it's nuthin, crush em' wit my night saw
Bout to get my flight on, charter or train
Pardon the name, but Crakk is just a part of the game
Far as the change, just bustin' my checks
Duckin my ex, gettin' shermed up in the Lex
Now how the fuck you get all that??

[Chrous repeat 2x]
Ring the alarm!
Another hater's dying
Oh boy, aye!

Ring the alarm!
When my gauge is firing
Cock back, dump on
You and your moms

[Omillio Sparks]
You cocksucker's got hate in ya blood
Y'all ain't happy that sparks got the cocked desi-eagle in yo mug
I rock, like MTV unplugged
Let the M-1 rock one of you fucks
I gives a fuck about who catches a slug or who tells
Cuz the kid got money for bail and if they get out give a fuck who out
Pricks still talkin measly, still talkin greasy
The "ROC" is rocked up and sold out
Y'all can't sell, and y'all won't be seen like an NFL blackout
My guns go "Blakow!"
Don't make me put the cocked nine right in front of yo eyes
And make y'all fucks cock-eyed...(Woman speaking spanish)
Who the fuck can fuck wit B. Sieg, Free and Omillio?
You young boys back up, while the trucks back out
When the "ROC" enters the building your best bet is get the fuck out
I bring clappers, get yo boys clapped up, fucker! (R-O-C..) Holla!

[Hook 2x]

[Freeway]
Freeway bust shots, it don't matter who
Can't even hug the block if I'm mad at you
Takin turns comin thru that's what my niggas do
Takin' turns inside yo chick that's what my click will do
Dark room, Cancun, spanish interview
Wit mamacita, Freeway, charmed to meet you
All, damn day I got some dick for her
No, way I never got no chips for her
Any day of the week, long-gun tucked every day of the week
Freak Nia Long lookin honey just about any day of the week
Guest ran thru sleep, got young niggas willing to grind
On your block wit a package of sweet
Cuz Free not stuck up
See me anywhere, won't get stuck up
Keep the heavy-hand, miss take that off
Toss them underwear, who those? my balls
Come from under there
Freeway, a boss don't you wanna stare?
Haters, get lost don't you understand?
Shit spit, be real don't you see these guns?
Fuck the, ice grill don't you see these dudes?
We from the ghetto, and they don't like our attitude
Mami say I'm loco, she don't like my attitude (Holla!)

[Hook 2x][Intro: Peedi Crakk]
Yea, uhhh

Hit the block with powder, like shower to shower
Stop all that nonsense boy

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sparks]
They say its a white man's world (white man's world)
I'm steady shootin' at my own kind rather fuck the next man's girl
Instead of going home to mine with a polluted mind
I guess going nuts others saw how they get down
Picked up on the game and left behind follow the sign
I kept my head to the sky even when I was down like everything was fine
Kept a smile (smile nigga)
Like the first day I was introduced to dinin'
And got to sipping and thinking all sorts of shit start going through my mind
Like State Prop. get it on until the end of time
The strength is in the numbers then I started thinking bout all them little bustas
That done crossed the motherfucka got to peeking at my burner
Snatch my keys off the dresser ran through the door and I hopped up in the squada
Started creeping through the heat of the night on these jokers
Don't I paint the perfect picture that's how the boy get down for the figures
Holla back nigga

[Hook][Hook: Beanie Sigel]
When you hear that, that's the sound of the police
Whoop, whoop, uh, don't get handcuffed by the beast
When you hear that, that means the cops is comin' nigga
You better get to runnin' nigga

[Verse 1 : Beanie Sigel]
It's been a long time, I shouldn't have left you
Without a rhyme about the nine and what the tech do
The four pound line, a thirty eight special
With AK shells through your teflon vest too
Yeah Scrap, when the Bastard's back out
The pastor's back out, the casket's passed out
It's shit bags, and them Catholic's passed out
Shoot up the crack house, smack worker's bond like crack's out
Go to war, Mack never backed out
The mac's get backed out, the air's get dust off
The cage get bust off, the shaft and the stock get cut off
Your cash and your block get cut off
And the SWAT and the ambulance rush off
My hand on my nuts like fuck ya'll
My SP Jeans drift, layin' on them s dot grim shits
I'm out to buck you like And 1, just run when the van come

[Hook: Beanie Sigel, Ol' Dirty Bastard]
When you hear that, that's the sound of the police
Whoop, whoop, man, you better throw that piece
Toss the handgun, before the man come
When you hear that, that means the cops is comin' nigga
You better get to runnin' nigga
Toss the handgun, before the man come

[Verse 2 : Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Wu, Wu, Wu, Wu, Wu, Wu, Wu, Wu, Wu..

Fuck Joanna, she hot, though we be hand her
The Ol' is famous, put in the rhymin'

Americana, half Montana
Only gonna smoke the best marijuana
Dis the Grammy's, on the panel
Change the channel, good smell flannel
You think shit is dandy, her pussy is candy
Forty foot Glock! Shoot with handy
I fucked Amanda, you talk propaganda
Only gettin' money, on the Miranda
I stay candid, government branded
Heavy handed, woman demanding

[Hook]

[Verse 3 : Peedi Crakk]
It's not game of R. Kelly
Run up on twenty-six and seven, coke peli'
Open up and them in deli, spray whoever the sweaty
My felony, mix emotions when I walk in that building
That's why I sip that purple pill that make choke up your seven, squeeze
Back the ac'! As if you don't notice
Make me call that boy Mack, Bean Sig' flip you over
Respect mine, them tech nine's ain't my thing
I defeat the purpose of teflon with one ring
Make the place, vacate, I can't wait
For you to come out your face, so I could come off the waist
Hey, it's Peedi, Peedi, when you see me, take it easy
My uncle be named Reesy, his luger be named Squeezy
Make you get low without M-Eazy
My murder just might please you, you know them niggas my people's

They tell me, Peedi, Peedi, crush easy, the Mac gon' ring

[Hook]

Look at my whips

[Verse 1: Peedi Crakk]
That Rollie, check that Rollie, it's time to party


[Verse 2: Redman]This is that telesoof fly, you can't get from a man
No gq, but this is swagger you gotta have
A fashion killer, go ask them niggas who pop them tags
I drop a bag money ain't funny so what I laugh
The cash is what I've been chasing since I've been dating
R Kelly on the molly, while poppin scrape on them datings
Got bitches in the back just in case we need penetration
We having fun, give me the buzz that go all my Nathan bitch
I'm just tryina make a name cause we not the same
How you niggas claimin you ballin when you out the game
Them shots burn, that vodka vray
Thought you was sick until the doctor came

What it do, nigga keep a bitch or 2
3 or 4, me on more, they some whores hit the crew
4 all dm htm, put it together, we the family drinking
And blow that kesha out that fanta leaf

Blow my lime to a lemon, my pa women
Take shots of cirock, coconut, pretending she give a fuck bout
What I be talking bout
But fuck it, hey this just the life
And I don't like it, I love it
Big booty stripper letting my nigga take turns in her
Apple bottom let a nigga put a worm in her
Had a problem with niggas until I got paid
And brought something for them brogs, hotshot raibe
In the building niggas chillin like a motherfucker
Cause I know it fin to kill one of you motherfuckers
A little whoa, all you hear from the mac, muffle crack juice
100 proof, get on my level
Not a nigga better no, never ever ball with avatars
Cedars off, take the jacket off, let the letters floss
Pwda, never a fraud, never lost, forever a boss
Whatever the cost, get out with my nigga

What it do, nigga keep a bitch or 2
3 or 4, me on more, they some whores hit the crew
4 all dm htm, put it together, we the family drinking
And blow that kesha out that fanta leaf[Hook/Intro: Black Thought]
Cheeba, cheeba this is Friday night street fever
Cheeba, cheeba this is Friday night street fever

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Cheeba, cheeba this is Friday night street fever
The heat seeker, keep it cuttin' like a meat cleaver
The grim reaper, I ain't eatin' ya'll ain't eatin' neither
The team leader, dream weaver, keep a mean diva
Makavellian, illegal alien rhyme on [nellian?]
Half ya'll cats are full of helium
Fuckin' with piranhas up inside of the aquarium
Breakin' sound barriers, cats is hail-maryin'
I am the apostle, I try to keep it gospel
It's on, knowing that aroma hit me in the nostril
I start spittin' shit white boys say they can mosh to
The hostile, natives here to motherfucking rock you
And pop this and that a ways, poison his gamma rays
Money making jam, split your brain to the mayonnaise
Then we at the VMA's playing it low-key
If I'm the best, then toast me and give me my trophy
You know the sick flows is what I kick mostly
You going to have to bring an army, you cannot just toast me
Your main lady tell me I'm in love like Joasky[?]
Take a shovel, look above, and filleted like poultry

[Verse 2: Dice Raw]
Secrets of a true magician, it's Jam Boy Magic
Pop up at your crib then slap you with the ratchet
You got it backwards, put your brain inside a basket
Blow a gasket, get your ass whipped wrapped in plastic
Throw them in the placid, I spit acid
And ecstasy, plus I got the recipe
Only niggas fucking with me standing right next to me
A million dead rappers and they at the bottom of the sea
And that's a good start, please don't let me start
Come up like tree bark, don't let me talk
Cause I'm gon' talk shit, then I'm going to back it up
These niggas is trash, somebody better slap them up
Step into my cypher, it's filled with lifers
It's filled with snipers, it's similar to Rikers
With eyes like tigers, and arms like spiders
With hearts like fires, and smiles like liars
With grip like pliers, and mouth like Pryors
It's raps new messiahs, man throw them in the frier

[Verse 3: Truck North]
These niggas get gassed like a Citgo
And what it's hittin' for
The Jam Boys get money like a Paltrow
And get bids from the in to the outro
Thinking they can fuck with the squad, they out they mind yo
Strapped to the teeth, guns nigga yo Joe G.I
Fresh when they see I
Time goes on, no rest for the weary
So if you peep the boy, peep the bad bitches with me
I think they got a problem Houston, call Whitney
It seems that I'm outer space and no jitney can get me
They like North cause he so sure like Atlantic City
In school I was the Dean no Martin, no Remey
I simply, cause a total shock to your culture
Hop in my car, drive to the Mars like Volta
Wait for you to fall, hit your carcass like a vulture
Niggas is endangered species, I'm a poacher
Askin' where the tusk at, nigga it's a must that
Jam Boys get paid, or else you get a gut-check
And got all the sucka niggas like what's next
Public enemy times three, the main suspects

[Verse 4: Peedi Crakk]
As I remain this, lyrical genius
You can't see me, but I can see the Venus
I can see your future, for you nothing changes
For me it's kind of strange, cause all I see is Beamers
Benzes, rangers and cause I arrange bangers
Why you writing raps, man you should be a singer
You should be a dancer like a ballerina
Get this boy a tutu, what we going to name her
We'll just call her Tutu, me and [Joey zutsu?]
We on some old school Philly shit, you ain't used to
Lookin' for a new boo, somethin' like a New New
I just want to train her, put her on the choo-choo
All you little rappers know Peedi go the meanest
And if I wasn't famous, you'd still be on the penis
Don't mean to be an anus, why you being brainless
I should be ashamed, don't know why I entertain thisI fuck em good, I fuck em long, long
I fuck em hot, I fuck em strong, strong
I fuck em right, you fuck em wrong wrong
Since I fuck em all I need to fuck the song

[Hook:]
Hey, I ain't preaching I ain't waiting

Shawty ask me am I dating, no
Bitch you're fucking first, fucking first
Fucking first, bitch you're fucking first, fucking first
That's shit girl I fuck the first, first
Run the train that will work
But I got to fuck em first

Okay I'm first upon this verse
And I'll beat it up first upon under that scarf
Scratch to fuck, first to squirt, first to chuck them duices work
Mollie second came that third, next to forth came that bitch to [?]
When that work, pussy got murb, exactly why I fuck her first
Above my shirt, bitch ain't deserve right in the club she wanna fuck
I told my man I'm bout to skirt

He said hole up, no crack you know what?
I know that bitch, she got that work
Yeah, that's fine and dandy but I'm fucking first

[Hook]

Let me go first, I don't need no kids

Bitch got just what I need it
Come, nigga don't wanna meet it
So, nigga off when I need it
Fuck em first, oh that's your girl?
