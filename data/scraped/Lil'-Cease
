[Verse 1: Lil' Cease]
Yo I be buyin em V's, so all my girls be eyein Cease
Comin backstage, dyin to get pleased
You got me, I rock thee, Versace and linen
While you stop your grinnin wit bunch of foxy women
Why you speed ball with cards, that's invalid
I get clothes, custom made, from a stylist
Cruise in my Lexus Land with no mileage
While you walk the street until your feet get calloused
Take you on a natural high, like a pilot
It be all good, toss your clothes like a salad
When it's all over put your vote in my ballot
It's my diner, I'm Mel, and you're Alice
Spend a night, in Lil' Cease palace
It be all good as long as you don't act childish
While you standin there with the Crist' in your cup
If worse come to worse keep this on the hush, uhh

[Hook: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I know you seen me on the video (true)
I know you heard me on the radio (true)
But you still don't pay me no attention
Listenin to what your girlfriends mention
He's a slut, he's a ho, he's a freak
Got a different girl every day of the week
It's cool, not tryin to put a rush on you
I had to let you know that I got a crush on you

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
Aiyyo shorty, won't you go get a bag of the lethal
I'll be undressed in the bra all see through
Why you count your jewels thinkin' I'mma cheat you?
The only one thing I wanna do is freak you
Keep your stone sets, I got my own baguettes
And I'll be doin things that you won't regret
Lil Kim the Queen Bee, so you best take heed
Shall I proceed? (Yes indeed!)
I'mma throw shade, if I can't get paid
Blow you up to your girl like the Army grenade
You can slide on my ice like the Escapade
And itchy-gitchy-yaya with the marmalade
Who me? Not you, oh yes, who's he?
I even dig yo' man's style, but I love yo' profile
Whisper in your ear and get you all shook up
But don't blush, just keep this on the hush

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil' Cease]
While you tryin to catch Sea Breeze, I'm in the PV's
All chrome D3's, decked out TV's
CD's with crazy bass, keep my lady laced
Don't be fooled by the baby face
I hope ya not, cause your thighs got me hot
Only one plan, that's to rise to the top
I told you before, when I first pursued
I want a interlude, in the nude

[Lil' Kim]
You know I love the way you feel-a, sip my tequil-a
Works from the dealers, all in chinchilla
Heat up the clutch, seven-fifty deluxe
Then we speed down the hutch, breakin trees in the dutch
I'm not the one you sleep wit, to eat quick
Want a cheap trick, better go down to FreakNik
You got to hit me off, buy this girl gifts of course
So I look sick, in my six, with my Christian LaCroix[Intro]
[Big] Huh?
[Cee] Cease-a-Lee'

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G]
Another day in the ghetto
One look outside I'm already upset yo
It look about a hundred-and-two
It's a Saturday and Biggie ain't got nothing to do
Uhh, I'm interrupted by a phone ring {*brrrrring*}
Sometimes I wish I never got the motherfucking thing
"Hello hello? Can I speak to Biggie?"
Yo, who dis? "Taisha" Yo call back, I'm busy
Why don't ya hit me on the box a little later
Washed up, got dressed, hits the elevator
Steps out it's the same old scene
Dope fiend, crack fiend, eyewitness news team
I seen a honey with a butt looking butter soft
I know she looks much better with them clothes up off
Sitting all thick, with the ruby red lipstick {*SMACK*}
That's the one I gotta get with

[Hook 1: Notorious BIG]
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha

"Why you wanna get with me?"
Cause you got a big B-U-T, T

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G]
She said "If I get with you

Sling skins for a living,my name ain't November

How to squeeze 22's in them Reebok shoes, HUH?

[Hook 2: Notorious BIG, Lil' Cease]

Cause you got a big B-U-T, T

[Verse 3: Notorious B.I.G]
I said walk me upstairs, cause I forgot my Phillies
She said "I don't care, so don't be acting silly"
I knew I had her trapped with my hardcore raps
And it wouldn't take a second before I had her on her back
Pulling back the bra straps, threw on my Silk CD
Cause, "I wanna get freaky with you"
Lose control on the skins is all I can picture, now I'm about to hit you

[Hook 3: Notorious BIG, Lil' Cease]
Can I get witcha (can I get witcha)
Can I get witcha (can I get witcha)
"Why you wanna get with me?"
Cause you got a big B-U-T, T

[Verse 4: Lil' Cease]
To all my hoes, respect due
Tamika sorry I left you
Michelle I'm glad I met you
You make the head feel special
Now I know it's official
That I can touch and tease you
Pull up my pants and diss you
And hit the door you came through
It's Cease-a-Lee, a.k.a. Mista Nasty
Germany style, these hoes they blast me
One of the chickenhead with sex appeal pass me
That's her hands, ankles, feet they ashy
I like the flashy type, who pass with dykes
With long hair, and they ass be right
I get up on that ass, see what that be like
I fuck a bitch good, if she ask me right, huh

[Hook 1 x2][Intro x4]
You got it goin' on, wha wha

I used to be scared of the dick, now I throw lips to the shit
Handle it like a real bitch

Take it in the butt, yah, yazz wha
I got land in Switzerland, even got sand in the Marylands
Bahamas in the spring, baby, it's a Big-Momma thing
Can't tell by the diamonds in my rings
That's how many times I wanna cum, twenty-one
And another one, and another one, and another one
Twenty-four carats nigga
That's when I'm fuckin' wit' the average nigga
Work the shaft, brothers be battin' me, and oh

Baby carriage, damn, I love that ass
Shit no, on a dime shit is mine
Got to keep 'em comin' all the time, why

[Refrain: Lil' Cease and Lil' Kim x2]
Killas be quiet, my nigga bring the riots
Tough talk, tough walk, shit is tired
You wanna be this Queen B, but ya can't be
That's why you're mad at me

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
How B.I.G. and 'Un' trust you in the studio with me
Don't they know I'm tryin' to sex you continuosly
Pull a high power Coup make, you jump ship
Leave who you wit', I'm with the Roc-A-Fella crew
Trick you for the cheese, tear your boom up
Spread a ill rumor, make you flip on Lil'Cease
Twist you backwards, get the dough from your platinum hits
Rock Little Kim hats and shit
I gets down and dirty for the dough
I got love and Big know it, He must got the studio bugged
Probably, as we speak he's on his way up the street
With the M.A.F.I.A. thugs and all types of heat
But I ain't tryin' to beef, I'm just tryin to eat
Horizontally, the way I hold my iron, sweet
And dem my niggas But I like the sound:
Lil' Kim and Jigga, it sound like figures

[Refrain x2]

[Verse 3: Lil' Kim]
Before I caught some niggas disease, got caught with his ki's

Threw me at high priced Beam's
Face on tv's, platinum CD's
Shit, I never faught

Stack the g's up, keeps the knees up
What the fuck, stay fillin, half a millin
Geneva Diva, yeah, I throws it down
Lay around, clown the clock stops for no one
Never 68 and owe 1, takes one to know one
Better off wit the Playboy magazines uh, fuckin' wit da Don
Push the keys, G's threes for pape's

Lieutenant takes mad dimes from New York to Anaheim
While you daydream and whine, I just keep gettin mine
And I'm married to this
Ya'll strategy misses still plannin weddin's
M.A.F.I.A. also deadens all the bullshit
Any type of threatens to pull shit, uh

[Refrain x4]Sample: Don't Stop Till You Get Enough

Yo, yo
Yo, if you gonna hit niggas' girl
Just expect niggas to hit your girl
And that's it
112 help me say

[112]
1 - If she got with you when
She already had a man
Why wouldn't she cheat on you
(Why wouldn't she cheat on you)
If she got with you when
She already had a man
Why wouldn't she cheat on you
(Why wouldn't she cheat on you)

[Mase]
Mase, come on
If I'm in the streets or I'm in my jeep
And I wit my peep, ex know not to speak
See it's all good, and it's all sweet
All women flirt, all women cheat
So I might spend a week down in Virginia Beach
Out or in the sheets blaze plenty freaks
Be the bad boy everybody wanna meet
Practice what I preach, never caught when I cheat
If I ain't work late, I say I was wit my peeps
And quick to tell a ho, yo I ain't get the beep
And all these girls is quite the same
So it ain't your pencil, it's how you write your name

Repeat 1

[Lil' Cease]
Ain't nobody hotter than the jam, don dada
Been around the world with girls at Ramada
Never been the one that chick, lotta scotta, protta
And yo when Cease got a girl he gotta
Though I love a ghetto girl that keep her doobie fly
39 in my Benz them niggas and super size
Girl talk slick but I see through the lies
You don't got TV, whatcha mean who am I
If you knew what I knew, you wouldn't be givin' her pearls
If you know that she cheap why you live with the girl
Half you cats couldn't live in my world
Cuz you couldn't picture another nigga hittin' your girl (what?)

Repeat 1

[Jay-Z]
Is it because my game is stronger, name last longer
On the brain like a whole eighth but can
Chicks stop, mesmerize rub up on they tetas
Like push up bras, who you dealin' with ma, he's jigga
You know the rawest, ice is flawless baby
Nice is lawless, recite for balla's
And I fools ya'll fake players every time
Cuz you only hit chicks that you think is mine
You know how I paid his due, but I'm unfatable
Mommy screamin' pappi can I skate wit you
They wanna ride wit me, stay fly wit me
Wanna help me get rid of my rivalries
Wanna be the ebony to my ivory
But I'm straight though, thanks ma, I only chase dough
We can lay for tonight but in the mornin'
I get Shirley Murdock, I hope your door slam lock, I'm gone

Repeat 1

[Mase]
Yo, you can't think you gonna be cheatin and the girl ain't gonna cheat
Just like you cheat, they could cheat
And I just think, you a fool if you think girls don't cheat[Lil' Kim: Intro]
Uh, where's all my single ladies at?
Where's my single ladies at?
Single ladies clap your hands

[Verse 1: Lil' Kim]
They say my music too hard and my mouth too nasty
Clothes too tight and my ass too sassy
I'm a love goddess haven't you heard?
Jehovah's my witness, spread the word
And all scrubs get kicked to the curb
Before you holla at me throw a few dollars at me
I see you got a brick in your pants
Would you like a table dance?
The boss lady make you pay for the sex
Then shake my ass like I'm at a Greekfest
No cash, I take Traveler's Checks
For an extra five g's you can have my address
The things I do I take a real risk
A lot of people think that I'm a real bitch
Don't judge me by the words of this song
Cause the media, they got me figured out wrong

[Hook: Lil' Kim]
I don't want anybody to get the wrong idea about me
I ain't got nothing to hide, my pussy ain't for free
Just like the Benz I drive you out of your mind
Some people think that I'm nasty, I just like having a good time

[Verse 2: Lil' Cease]
Yo, yo, yo
Yo that single life shit, that be me
Front ass at the bar, where the chickens be?
Got two hoes, Tonya and Tiffany
Finger in the drawers and we downin' Henessy
Then I hit the door slide to the ride
Now I'm gettin' head in the Q-45
That's LV, minors is six and up
With the big atennas that be sittin' up
I'm livin' it up, drink Cris, piss in the cup
With a bunch of birds that with it to fuck
I love life (no doubt)
So fuck a ho and a wife
Peace and love to all my sluts and my dikes
Cease never treat a bitch nice
I wanna bitch that smoke and don't get an appetite
I fuck to die cause my mom fucked for me
That's why my niggas never sling dick for free
Feel me?

[Hook 2: Lil' Cease]
I don't want anybody to get the wrong idea about Cease
I have no love for hoes, my dick just ain't for free
I keep a lot of pussy on my mind
Some people think that I'm nasty
I just like fucking all the time

[Lil' Cease]
See some niggas do, and some niggas don't
Pay for the pussy, some niggas won't
See, I ain't the type that can say "I Don't"
Once the bitch see the six, I ain't gotta do shit

[Lil' Kim]
You can be Cash and I'll be Tango
Bingo, you know just how this thang go
Niggas wanna get with me without the ching-ching dough
The Green Bling flow, I don't think so

[Lil' Cease]
I jumps out like "Biotch! Who the fuck you with?"
On some real Jigga shit, haters suck my dick
If you out for the ones then out come the guns
Once I call the duns, then out come the slugs

[Lil' Kim]
I got an island name Queen Bee
And a dog that's a Pickingese
What you call romancing, don't tickle my fantasy
Put your money where your mouth is, talk is cheap
Buy me a country and a monkey, or don't even come to me

[Chorus 3: Lil' Kim]

[Chorus 4: Lil' Cease]

[Lil' Kim]
Queen Bee
Lil' Cease[Lil' Cease]
What up B.I.G. what's the deal?
I hope you aight
I'm just, doin' my thing living day to day life
Yo you taught me the game, now we play alike
You taught me how to aim, when we bust gunz we spray alike
A lot of shit going on, Mafia holding on
My heart is from the start so I keep your name strong
Sittin here sippin' Hen, don't know where to begin
My album done now we're finishing Kim's
I'm tryin to get it right
Get my life back, on the right track
Walkin in street dressed in black, matchin my gat
I see my death coming, it's no turning back
Long as I see you again, that'll be that
Yo momz told me "Slow down Cease, chill and relax"
"Get On your knees and Pray to you, you'll soon talk back"
There, speakin of yo momz, thru her frustrations
And dedication, we helped her formed up the Foundation
Thank B.I.G

[112] {Chorus}
Day dreaming, wishing you were here with me
(Wishing you were here with me)
Said it, I'm day dreaming (ohhh)
Just to have you here with me
We're missing you, (B.I.G)
B.I.G

[Lil' Cease]
Yo I remeber far back as the game goes
]From the first bank rollz to the Cool Jeanz and Kango's
Breezing on the yacht, Dp's on the rock
Think of all the fly V's we used to swap
We took it up a notch
And everything that was hot, for $5,000 we copped
Little Cease, I'd a cop, rock, all types of a satch
50 G's on the watch, me and you up in the Spot
MtV was in shock, and I don't see why not
Man, we used to rock all the BET spots
Turned clubs into stadiums
And I remeber when you and Rock got knocked in the Paladium
And when we rock we do it all for you
And uh, don't gotta worry bout the names they was calling you
And I'ma tell you what we gonna do
Make hits and couldn't quit if we wanted to (yes I, won't stop)
Even though you're outta sight, you're never outta mind
I try to tell myself, when it's yo time, it's yo time
Ever since that weekend, everybody been beefin' and greifing
Losin they appetites, nobody eatin (miss you, yeah)
And it's due to all the weavin, I walked yo kidz to your coffin
And tell em "daddy's sleeping" (daddy's sleeping)
But Killa he don't understand
He don't know that ignorance killed a wonderful man
You're not just another Rapper, wit money in yo hand
I think, what's the money, when I ain't got my man
That's why day's I walk the surface, feeling earthless (Oh Biggie)
Thinking was this rap shit really worth it (is it really worth it?)
And I know you didn't deserve it, It went so smooth
You thought they rehearsed it, Worst shit I ever
Seen at a young age, it's fucked up when I see my man on front page
I reminisce on the old days, Love, Forever and Always
B.I.G. Nigga...


[112] {Chorus}X 2
Day dreaming, Said I'm wishing you were here
(Wishing you were here with me)
Said we're missing you
Said it, I'm day dreaming (Wishing you..)
Just to have you here with me B.I.G
We're missing you, (B.I.G)
B.I.G
Day dreaming, wishing you were here (You were more than a friend)
(Wishing you were here with me) (you were like a brother to 112)
Said we're missing you
Said it, I'm day dreaming (We need you here for today...)
Just to have you here with me B.I.G
We're missing you, (B.I.G)
B.I.G
Day dreaming, wishing you were here with me
(Wishing you were here with me)
Said it, I'm day dreaming (ohhh)
Just to have you here with me
We're missing you, (B.I.G)
B.I.G
Day dreaming, wishing you were here with me
(Wishing you were here with me) (such a wonder full man)
Said it, I'm day dreaming (ohhh) ( B.I.G.)
Just to have you here with me( and I can't stop thinking about you)
We're missing you, (B.I.G)
B.I.G
We Love you Always..
Ooohh...

Twist you backwards, get the dough from your platinum hits
Rock Little Kim hats and shit
I gets down and dirty for the dough
I got love and Big know it, He must got the studio bugged
Probably, as we speak he's on his way up the street
With the M.A.F.I.A. thugs and all types of heat

Horizontally, the way I hold my iron, sweet
And dem my niggas But I like the sound:
Lil' Kim and Jigga, it sound like figures

[Refrain x2]

Another day in the ghetto
One look outside I'm already upset yo

It's a Saturday and Biggie ain't got nothing to do
Uhh, I'm interrupted by a phone ring {*brrrrring*}
Sometimes I wish I never got the motherfucking thing
"Hello hello? Can I speak to Biggie?"
Yo, who dis? "Taisha" Yo call back, I'm busy
Why don't ya hit me on the box a little later
Washed up, got dressed, hits the elevator
Steps out it's the same old scene
Dope fiend, crack fiend, eyewitness news team

I know she looks much better with them clothes up off
Sitting all thick, with the ruby red lipstick {*SMACK*}
That's the one I gotta get with

How to squeeze 22's in them Reebok shoes, HUH?

[Verse 3: Notorious B.I.G]
I said walk me upstairs, cause I forgot my Phillies
She said "I don't care, so don't be acting silly"
I knew I had her trapped with my hardcore raps
And it wouldn't take a second before I had her on her back
Pulling back the bra straps, threw on my Silk CD
Cause, "I wanna get freaky with you"
Lose control on the skins is all I can picture, now I'm about to hit you

[Hook 3: Notorious BIG, Lil' Cease]
Can I get witcha (can I get witcha)

To all my hoes, respect due
Tamika sorry I left you

That I can touch and tease you
Pull up my pants and diss you

It's Cease-a-Lee, a.k.a. Mista Nasty
Germany style, these hoes they blast me
One of the chickenhead with sex appeal pass me

I like the flashy type, who pass with dykes
With long hair, and they ass be right
I get up on that ass, see what that be like
I fuck a bitch good, if she ask me right, huh

[Hook 1 x2]Sample: Don't Stop Till You Get Enough

Yo, yo
Yo, if you gonna hit niggas' girl
Just expect niggas to hit your girl
And that's it
112 help me say

[112]
1 - If she got with you when
She already had a man
Why wouldn't she cheat on you
(Why wouldn't she cheat on you)
If she got with you when
She already had a man
Why wouldn't she cheat on you
(Why wouldn't she cheat on you)

[Mase]
Mase, come on
If I'm in the streets or I'm in my jeep
And I wit my peep, ex know not to speak
See it's all good, and it's all sweet
All women flirt, all women cheat
So I might spend a week down in Virginia Beach
Out or in the sheets blaze plenty freaks
Be the bad boy everybody wanna meet
Practice what I preach, never caught when I cheat
If I ain't work late, I say I was wit my peeps
And quick to tell a ho, yo I ain't get the beep
And all these girls is quite the same
So it ain't your pencil, it's how you write your name

Repeat 1

[Lil' Cease]
Ain't nobody hotter than the jam, don dada
Been around the world with girls at Ramada
Never been the one that chick, lotta scotta, protta
And yo when Cease got a girl he gotta
Though I love a ghetto girl that keep her doobie fly
39 in my Benz them niggas and super size
Girl talk slick but I see through the lies
You don't got TV, whatcha mean who am I
If you knew what I knew, you wouldn't be givin' her pearls
If you know that she cheap why you live with the girl
Half you cats couldn't live in my world
Cuz you couldn't picture another nigga hittin' your girl (what?)

Repeat 1

[Jay-Z]
Is it because my game is stronger, name last longer
On the brain like a whole eighth but can
Chicks stop, mesmerize rub up on they tetas
Like push up bras, who you dealin' with ma, he's jigga
You know the rawest, ice is flawless baby
Nice is lawless, recite for balla's
And I fools ya'll fake players every time
Cuz you only hit chicks that you think is mine
You know how I paid his due, but I'm unfatable
Mommy screamin' pappi can I skate wit you
They wanna ride wit me, stay fly wit me
Wanna help me get rid of my rivalries
Wanna be the ebony to my ivory
But I'm straight though, thanks ma, I only chase dough
We can lay for tonight but in the mornin'
I get Shirley Murdock, I hope your door slam lock, I'm gone

Repeat 1

[Mase]
Yo, you can't think you gonna be cheatin and the girl ain't gonna cheat
Just like you cheat, they could cheat
And I just think, you a fool if you think girls don't cheat[Verse 1]
I'mma tell you how I want it, ahead of time
Lettin you know, Cease ain't givin no dough

Get a lady by my side, when we puff La

She said her favorite song was, Ebony and I
The dick make em happy, I'm they baby daddy
Flossin in the 6 yeah, me and Puff Daddy

You got me, I rock thee, Versace and linen
While you stop your grinnin wit bunch of foxy women
Why you speed ball with cards, that's invalid
I get clothes, custom made, from a stylist
Cruise in my Lexus Land with no mileage
While you walk the street until your feet get calloused
Take you on a natural high, like a pilot
It be all good, toss your clothes like a salad
When it's all over put your vote in my ballot
It's my diner, I'm Mel, and you're Alice
Spend a night, in Lil' Cease palace
It be all good as long as you don't act childish
While you standin there with the Crist' in your cup
If worse come to worse keep this on the hush, uhh

[Hook: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I know you seen me on the video (true)
I know you heard me on the radio (true)
But you still don't pay me no attention
Listenin to what your girlfriends mention
He's a slut, he's a ho, he's a freak
Got a different girl every day of the week
It's cool, not tryin to put a rush on you
I had to let you know that I got a crush on you

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
Aiyyo shorty, won't you go get a bag of the lethal
I'll be undressed in the bra all see through
Why you count your jewels thinkin' I'mma cheat you?
The only one thing I wanna do is freak you
Keep your stone sets, I got my own baguettes
And I'll be doin things that you won't regret
Lil Kim the Queen Bee, so you best take heed
Shall I proceed? (Yes indeed!)
I'mma throw shade, if I can't get paid
Blow you up to your girl like the Army grenade
You can slide on my ice like the Escapade
And itchy-gitchy-yaya with the marmalade
Who me? Not you, oh yes, who's he?
I even dig yo' man's style, but I love yo' profile
Whisper in your ear and get you all shook up
But don't blush, just keep this on the hush

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil' Cease]
While you tryin to catch Sea Breeze, I'm in the PV's
All chrome D3's, decked out TV's
CD's with crazy bass, keep my lady laced
Don't be fooled by the baby face
I hope ya not, cause your thighs got me hot
Only one plan, that's to rise to the top
I told you before, when I first pursued
I want a interlude, in the nude

[Lil' Kim]
You know I love the way you feel-a, sip my tequil-a
Works from the dealers, all in chinchilla
Heat up the clutch, seven-fifty deluxe
Then we speed down the hutch, breakin trees in the dutch
I'm not the one you sleep wit, to eat quick
Want a cheap trick, better go down to FreakNik
You got to hit me off, buy this girl gifts of course
So I look sick, in my six, with my Christian LaCroixIntro: Blake C

Our slogan:
Bullets don't have no names
And how we keep our circle tight
We shake off the lanes
Thats primo
And when Blake say so
Have ya family ridin
Behind the Hearse and Limo
Guess who in the last car
System knocked like a disco
Thinkin BIG, thinkin cris
Bumpin "Missing You"
It's all about the cash flow
Get up in they asshole
When you spit, just give em a taste
Thats hotter than tabasco
See, ever since I was a little rascal
Uh, never was bashful
To let out more nuts than cashew
Was swarmed by so many honeys
You thought I did taboo
Well baby, it's natural
With charm is how I grasp you
God bless me
When a nigga ha-choo
When a nigga ha-choo
When a nigga ha-choo
God bless me
When a nigga ha-choo

Chorus: Blake C
Get out our way, get out our way

Never move the way we move
We're too clever, clever, clever, clever, clever

Verse Two: Lil Cease
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
This rap shit, I'm the father

Security house, cameras that monitor you
My bitches freak nasty in front of you
If I give her the word, she'll swallow a few
Gargle it too
Cease game stick like glue
Crazy, a lotta you tell
You never forgave me
My ice grain like, shine on the shammy????
My thugs come in a bunch, but not the Bradys
Go to war, like niggas in Haiti
No if, ands or maybe
Not up going to school, just lazy
Fuck the chickens
I trick dick to the ladies
Come with the force thats greatly
My stash go in the safe with the key
Don't be mad at what God made me
Muthafuckas

Chorus: Blake C
Get out our way, get out our way
Ya'll betta pray, niggas betta pray
I told ya I was comin, I told ya we were coming
Ya best to start runin, Ya best to start runnin

Never move the way we move
We're too clever, clever, clever, clever, clever (Puffy - It's my turn now)

Verse Three: Puff Daddy

We're too clever, clever, clever, clever, clever (And we won't stop)[Lil' Kim: Intro]
Uh, where's all my single ladies at?
Where's my single ladies at?
Single ladies clap your hands

[Verse 1: Lil' Kim]
They say my music too hard and my mouth too nasty
Clothes too tight and my ass too sassy
I'm a love goddess haven't you heard?
Jehovah's my witness, spread the word
And all scrubs get kicked to the curb
Before you holla at me throw a few dollars at me
I see you got a brick in your pants
Would you like a table dance?
The boss lady make you pay for the sex
Then shake my ass like I'm at a Greekfest
No cash, I take Traveler's Checks
For an extra five g's you can have my address
The things I do I take a real risk
A lot of people think that I'm a real bitch
Don't judge me by the words of this song
Cause the media, they got me figured out wrong

[Hook: Lil' Kim]
I don't want anybody to get the wrong idea about me
I ain't got nothing to hide, my pussy ain't for free
Just like the Benz I drive you out of your mind
Some people think that I'm nasty, I just like having a good time

[Verse 2: Lil' Cease]
Yo, yo, yo
Yo that single life shit, that be me
Front ass at the bar, where the chickens be?
Got two hoes, Tonya and Tiffany
Finger in the drawers and we downin' Henessy
Then I hit the door slide to the ride
Now I'm gettin' head in the Q-45
That's LV, minors is six and up
With the big atennas that be sittin' up
I'm livin' it up, drink Cris, piss in the cup
With a bunch of birds that with it to fuck
I love life (no doubt)
So fuck a ho and a wife
Peace and love to all my sluts and my dikes
Cease never treat a bitch nice
I wanna bitch that smoke and don't get an appetite
I fuck to die cause my mom fucked for me
That's why my niggas never sling dick for free
Feel me?

[Hook 2: Lil' Cease]
I don't want anybody to get the wrong idea about Cease
I have no love for hoes, my dick just ain't for free
I keep a lot of pussy on my mind
Some people think that I'm nasty
I just like fucking all the time

[Lil' Cease]
See some niggas do, and some niggas don't
Pay for the pussy, some niggas won't
See, I ain't the type that can say "I Don't"
Once the bitch see the six, I ain't gotta do shit

[Lil' Kim]
You can be Cash and I'll be Tango
Bingo, you know just how this thang go
Niggas wanna get with me without the ching-ching dough
The Green Bling flow, I don't think so

[Lil' Cease]
I jumps out like "Biotch! Who the fuck you with?"
On some real Jigga shit, haters suck my dick
If you out for the ones then out come the guns
Once I call the duns, then out come the slugs

[Lil' Kim]
I got an island name Queen Bee
And a dog that's a Pickingese
What you call romancing, don't tickle my fantasy
Put your money where your mouth is, talk is cheap
Buy me a country and a monkey, or don't even come to me

[Chorus 3: Lil' Kim]

[Chorus 4: Lil' Cease]

[Lil' Kim]
Queen Bee
Lil' Cease* apparently also on a DJ Clue "Hev E. Components Part 1" album

[Snoop] + (Lil' Kim)

[Lil' Cease] + (Snoop)

Don't love no ho (That's my principle)
Cause ahh.. (Bitches come)
And ahh.. (Bitches go)
That's why I get my nut and I be out the fuckin do'
Say knick, knack, give ya dog a bone
Which one of you broads Cease can take home
Cease is a freak, big brown and large
Fuck with the hoes, big light and tall
It take two to make the thing go right
Strip, flash, titties, ass
Oh, no, Cease-A-Leo baby
All up in that ass, you so crazy
I'm a freak from the heart and I'll fuck for y'all
And your mouth hit the spot where I rest my balls
I pimp to die, and my mob pimp for me
That's why Cease never eat chicks for free, you feel me?

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
How many, hot licks does it take?
Mami, how many hot licks does it take
(I don't know, I don't know, just keep on lickin it)
But how many, hot licks does it take?

[Snoop Dogg]
Break breakin a bitch
Take takin a bitch, to a whole 'nother level and shit
Man, I didn't really wanna take her there
Because, she kept on pullin on my underwear
I don't send for hoes, I pimp for hoes
I do this for dis and dose
"Figaro, Figaro.."
Nigga we got hoes, we got hoes.. we got hoes
Fo', five, six, seven.. licks
Now mami, lick it again
Eight, nine, ten, eleven.. twelve
Now tell all your friends
Bring Keisha, Evette, and Shamika too

And we doin this all night long
Get ya pick on lick on, and your proper freak on

[Chorus]

[Lil' Kim]
(This is the G-mix)
Ladies and gentlemen, pimps and hoes
I'd like to present to you
(This is the G-mix)
The winner of the Gangstress of the Year Award
Introducin the Queeeeeeeen..

I don't need no introduction, they know who I be
Female mack with the gangsta rap
How many licks niggas just not knowin
So a bitch like me don't stop flowin
My money green and it don't stop growin
Ice like the winter and it don't stop snowin
M.A.F.I.A., that's the crew that I bang for
Grew up in the hood now what the fuck I'm gon' change for
Vuitton sweaters wit leathers and amourettas
Berratas inside of but still nobody do it better
Huh, ya never seen this stroke of genius
Put the cleanest meanest lips on ya penis
It's like that once you lick the kitty cat
Niggas don't know how to act, leavin diamonds in my ass crack
Now all my niggas now, all my bitches now
C'mon like Nelly, c'mon take it down down

[Chorus] - repeat to fade[Intro]
This is my letter

The world took you through hell hope you in heaven bro
Talk to you in my prayers but here my letter go

And on your b-day gotta hit the weed and brew

Me and Kim had a fallin out
I love her like a Sis wish that I could call her now
The M.A.F.I.A. doing there thing though

Rap's lame yo anyone could get a deal
I rock with jada Ricky ross and Eminem
Black Kangol reppin like if Biggies here
But ain't shit change though Diddy run the city still
Remember mase parked by the hydrant
The cops came with the warrants knocking
A bunch of weed and some O's in the closets
5 guns I said 2 of those was my shits
And it was plain to see
I was eighteen but you would do the same for me
Since you be gone can't tell you how life is now
Now I miss you so much its hard for me to right this down
I talk to faith every other week or two
She been cool taking care of the Cs for you
A lot of pain on this part of town
But I can say mark & wayne holdin Ms. wallace down
Still go through Harlem in the summertime
And hit branson boy you know we love the lah
I done what you would did
Its still stupid big
Remember 123rd where kuda used to live
Im just tripping reminiscing witcha
And if you dont know nothin
Know a nigga miss ya
And all the groupies still feel us
Guess what Big ya movies in theaters
Got me smelling like kool- aid
Did 21 something mill thats in 2 days
You know the team and us was there
Busta Buss was in the house and jigga came to the premiere
So much pain cause you was dear to me
Such a beautiful thing wish you was here to see
And now before I finish the letter
This could be better
If I would thank Mrs. Violetta
And to you son I love you your my homie ben dren
Big brother my only best friend
I'm glad you taught its about being me, yours truly your heart ceaserlee. (im gone)[Puffy]
Let these Muthafuckaz know (Brooklyn)
We ain't playin(It's my time to shine)

Fuck blazers and roofs, we kick the door down
Beat you in the jaw now, move swift like a coke on a grey hound
Nigga what, it's been a long time comin but it was bound to come
Cause I been doing this shit since day one
Yeah, niggas talk it but then niggas walk it
I'ma be in the benz flossin', Look at chicken's crossing
Like vaseline, old school gather deans, uh no exposure in no magazines
Think you can test my team?
Team up boy you still can't match my queen
With a lack of self esteem, foolish pleasure, layed out on a stretcher
Tryin to test the, mic molester, word to my uncle Fester
I put it on y'all B.I.G. warned y'all about the thugz that wrote calls

[Chorus]
It's been a long time coming but it was bound to come
We been puttin in bidz far too long
It's been a long time coming but it was bound to come

Start to love em then you trickin your cheese
Her and her friend whippin the V and that ain't me
I switch my bitch up bitch up like Jordan in the playoffs
Switchin his kicks off, you got it mixed up like the hash seeds and
Sticky greens that I twist up, for me it just be luck
I'm holdin mine jump in the truck, what, just hang a bitch, bang a bitch
Leave em in dead, coffin style, bitches love a thug when they smile, uhhh
It's me yo, the poet, street gigolo, mafia dough got plans for this shit to

[Chorus]
It's been a long time coming but it was bound to come

We been puttin in bidz far too long ...
It's been a long time comin but it was bound to come
We been on this shit since day one

[Lil Cease]
Niggas talk it while I live it, nigga it's so vivid
See when B.I.G. did it, I keep it Jig wit it
These niggas ain't got enough dough to get wit it
The heart, you can't get it Mr L you won't get it
Got enough tissue y'all? Cease done shitted
Album done fully submitted and all that dip down long sleeve, fitted hat
Been doing this since way back, 94, fully newer score
Till 96 when track masters signed the law (what) then I gassed em all
Launched July 4th now it's top floor, just before the war (which war)
That's bi-coastal, fuck the cast that's vocal, spit the class focal
Watch me blow you, smoke you, fuck you, I dug a bitch but not you (why)
Bigger calmness, Niggas don't really wanna start shit, it's coming

[Chorus]
It's been a long time coming but it was bound to come
We been puttin in bidz far too long
It's been a long time coming but it was bound to come
We been doin this shit since day one

We been puttin in bidz far too long ...
It's been a long time comin but it was bound to come
We been doin this shit since day one

Do y'all want beef (uh uh) or do y'all want peace? (uh uh)
Y'all don't really wanna see me take it to the streets (uh uh)
When we do, nigga, we get deeper than the sea (c'mon)
Bodies fell, floatin' way out in Tennesee (yeah)
Can't handle one, so why ask for ten of me? (uh huh)
And went up by the enemy, leave them a memory
Just like Kennedy, from state-to-state, city-to-city
There where the grimy and gritty once told by Frank Nitty
What's the dilly? Niggas still frontin' Willy
Actin' like they ahead o' the game
Put the four-point-six in the Range (c'mon)
Itchy like wearin' wool in the rain
And keep it simple nigga, but with me, it's just plain
Like Eminem's rhymes is rim, DJ's keep spinnin' them (spinnin' them)
If they ain't down with the fam
I ain't really feelin' them (I ain't feelin' them)
Especially if they got something to say about Cease and them (Cease and them)
So for now, with the and-one, that's how we greetin' them

Repeat 1

[G-Dep]
I got a lot to gain, these cats playin' and it's not a game
It is a game but I forgot you playin' (I forgot you playin')
Forgot your name, forgot your claim (uh)
But I remember when the bullets stopped your brain
And like, got your chain
It's plain simple, use your brain tissue (uh huh)
Or you could remain cripple, wishin' they ain't hit you (yeah)
Not inofficial, y'all niggas counterfeit
Shot about seventeen natural, something's bound to hit (huh)
Bounded with a team of shakers to see the paper
Then blow like Anita Baker, if you need it, just make it
If you need to wake up, holler
I Kiss the Girls to make them holler, make them bounce
Anything to make a dollar, y'all understandin' me (uh)
I just do it, I ain't the one to plan it
Just hide it under the table, shit, I'm underhanded (uh huh)
Perfected the nine, perfected the line (yeah)
Nasty, perfected with lime (yeah)
Busted with paper, infected with rhyme

A bitch like me gives it on the first date
Why hesitate? I ain't got time to wait!

Yo, handsome Hansun

Niggas come fast, went out like Helly Hanson
Mr. Bristal, you will never catch me dancin'
Often prancing, only in a mansion
In the party, I'm high and drunk, I see you glancin'
Never blow my cool, even if it's jammin'
If shit hit the fan then I got the cannon
Cock, lick-shots, leave 'em where they standin'
You can call the cops, I never get ran in
Call Blake C., ya'll get the understanding
Who my man is, who the fam' is
All that bullshit you talk? Can it, we own the planet
It's a definite, niggas over money, reppin' it
Armageddon it, destroy e'rything when we settin' it
You delicate, far away in the country where you better get
Assets in, nigga
Ya'll need to get wit' some veterans

[Lil' Cease]
Yo, yo, yo

Gats be sparkin', they lie too
Not Crips and Bloods, it's Piru
B-Roc I'mma die for you
Till this day, I'mma ride for you
And God forbid, gotta die too
When you pull that gat, I'll be right beside you
To guide you, on who to hit and not to
If a nigga guilty, got to die too
That's the real-la, you're talkin' to the roach killer
For more scrilla
About to upset New York like Reggie Miller
Once they say you turn thug, you turn killer
Man, it's hard to turn back when a nigga feel ya
That's why they tell ya you're nobody 'til somebody kill ya
That's why until ya play it back, don't get too familiar
Cause if you get too close, my nigga's might fuckin' killa ya
Nigga

[Lil' Kim]
Another one
The Queen Bee, extraordinaire
Lil' Cease, commin' at'cha
For the year 2000 and the new millennium, Uh

Fuck all you hoes, I blows like flutes
Bitches don't shake my hand, they salute the lieutenant
Rich men kiss the back of the hand of the royal highness
Pocohontas, Mafia's behind us, ballin' like Utah
Didn't think a ghetto bitch could come this far
From pushin' Buicks to candy apple red Jaguars
Bitch think I'm rich, I could rock a Fubu suit
A furry Kangol with some cowboy boots
And still be the shit of the night
When I come through
You be on the side holdin' ya cups like the bums do
Waitin' for the Queen to put some change in it
I pull out a 'G' and drop it with a hundred grand left in my pocket
I promoted this shit, so I got's to make a profit
And all the ends are sins to my men's, down his prophet
Me and Lil' Cease, it's part two, me partners
Layin' niggas down like carpenters
So pardon us, like Nike's, we just do it
We ain't amateurs to this shit, we used to it
And all the bodies I killed, keep 'em on file
So when they anniversaries come, we pop Cristall
Ask Bristal, the Golden Child, ta-dow
Take it how I gives it, you talk it, you live it
And don't forget it, bitches

[Puffy]
Stop tryin' to sound like her too, bitches

Repeat 1 while:

You don't wanna play around[Lil' Kim]
S-W nine millimeter, check
Long-nose double barreled rifle, check
Semi-automatic infrared laser beam shot, check
Alright Puff, I'm ready to go

Threw the clips around the shoulders, toasters in the holster
(Kim let's go!) Slow down bab' bro
You with the rap Rambo, Tony Montana
Here's a hammer, a camera and a "Life After Death" bandana
Here take it - in case I don't make it
Cause if my life don't end, I'm damn sure gon' fake it
The way I see it, mmm, sexual
In the gunfight, two on three, you on me
Dawg, I got shit to make the world shake
One mistake, BLAOW, start a earthquake
Fuck them niggas, them niggas dust to me
And if I knock Cyrus off that's a plus to me
And the funny thing about it, I'm a bitch
And got niggas runnin from me, like the Olympics
And I'm told my man Gutter I'mma get him
And every shell I spit, is guaranteed to hit him, BLAKA

Chorus: Grace Jones

Pre-ssure down below.. fire in de hole..
Lose control.. got nowhere to go..

[Lil' Kim]
I heard Cease and Puff callin like the Holy Tabernacle
I'll be - down in a minute, I'm drinkin a Snapple

[Lil' Cease]
A Snapple? Bitch I got bombs and shit
Grenades and razor blades and alarms and shit
You better come on, girl, throw a hat on that weave
I'm tryin to catch this nigga Cyrus, 'fore him n his boys leave
They at this resteraunt that serve African food
Where you allowed to smoke weed and the waiters is type rude
You see, I used to date this bitch from Botswana
Half-African but she looked like Madonna
Aiyyo check it, she had a tiger for a pet
I'll never forget, the resteraunt is where we met
And her girlfriend Lizette, that bitch is a freak
I used to fuck her in the ass while my girl was asleep
And she the one who told me where these cats is at
I can't wait to get the gat and holla back - Kim c'mon!

Chorus

[Lil' Kim]
Uhhh, uhhh! Uhhh
We came to a red light, gave right-of-way to pedestrians
Two black and white lesbians (Hey hey baby)
The nigga Puff ready to holla at these bitches
(Hey baby let me holla at you for a second)
I'm like, "Yo DAWG, them bitches down with them niggas"
And never would the drugs make the bitch slack up
I got HIT MEN, spreaded through the resteraunt for backup
And we communicate through headsets and walkie-talkies
Them niggas just bitches like my Yorkie
Pigs like the Porky, we on point like snipers
Cyrus and his Doolies, is Clueless like the movies
All I can think about, is how he killed my man Smiles
Cut his head off, massacre style
Yeah, Cyrus did it, Cyrus the Virus they call him
When I finish with him PLEASE, his name is Swiss Cheese
My main focus, is his righthand man Mouse
Sheisty and two-sided, profession - dickrider
And his boys, they seem to be all on his dick
I mean the whole situation is really makin me sick
And when Cyrus got up, and dipped off to the bathroom
We started suckin niggas up like a vacuum
Bullets flyin nonstop, and bodies droppin
Puff yelled, "AWAY!" That's the cops then
My trigger finger started itchin
Then Cyrus came spittin from the kitchen
And next second, you missed it
Listen, it's soundin like the 4th of July
Like the solar eclipse is lit right in the sky
I can't believe this guy, he won't fall over
Holes is in his body the size of cup holders
One more shot, he's over, shit Puff, I'm empty
(Here, I only got one shot left!)
But I'mma hold my breath, til he fall to his death
But he was helpless
This little kid squeezed off in his pelvis

Chorus 3X w/ ad libs (to fade)[Verse 1: Lil Cease]
Nigga, what you won't we will do
For instance, trying to [...] your body from the mildew
Fucking with me is like walking on thin ice with a steel shoe
Shoot your grandmother, thou shots should kill you
Sixteen years still B.I. to the death
While you middle-level balling niggas fall a nest
I'm trying to eat
That's a vegan flow with no beef
And I love it like [?] with no teeth
Y'all niggas just a waste of air like slow leaks
While we kill niggas dead on tracks, cold cheeks
You fucking with a don, get you cut like a coupon
Bloody like a newborn, posted like a photon
Niggas bleed just like us, that's what Big said
All my niggas ready to die because Big did
Yeah, and I'm a hardbody rider
Brooklyn nigga to the death, yes, a outsider

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
Tell me what the fuck an angel does
From seeing kids who ain't aged enough
Getting high of angel dust
From NY to Los Angeles, it ain't no love
In the heart of the city looking where their car at or their Pontiac
Get cardiac arrest if you feel risky
Real pissy, I change cheese to real [?] and
Cats used to yawn on his raps now look at him
Shit ain't been the same since the niggas started booking him
Bullet with your pin up looking sharper than bulletin
With pin-stripes and hollow tip bullets in it
He's something that you'd invest in
Catch him on Late Night, but he ain't interesting
Pop up and poop out something like intestines
It's no correction cause the mic been checking
The only time be asking is when he be sexing
My team like Teenage Mutants and X-Men
Fire spark when I be stepping, he the human torch
Inhale it, fules of all sorts of course
Steez taught me how to store in my ball shorts
So we stopped by the D, we never get caught
I say it again, we face L's, but never lost
Here to be a baller, but fell six feet short
Each day in this living hell, feel remorsed
But he had a million dollar smile way before he flossed
I'm off

[Verse 3: Uncle Murda]
March 9th is Biggie day
Any one of them dudes could get it from Snoop to Dre
Nah, don't say that - they be on some chill shit
You know me, I can't help but say some real shit
Man, especially when it come to Big
I'm getting high like damn they took him from his kids
Oh, we let them cockroaches kill a legend
Ain't nobody out here but me repping
Man, I grew up listening to Big
Had shootouts after I finished listening to Big
Dawg, if I ain't rep Big the most
Then the real Rick Ross never seen a brick of coke
For Big I feed a nigga the whole clip
Let me catch a nigga that ran with the Death Row clique
R.I.P. to best manager - Chris Lighty
Before he died he had got LA Reid to sign me

[Verse 4: Maino]
Yeah, coming from the BK where they don't hesitate to waste life
Underworld, where we sleep days and up nights
Only live once so I'm out on the streets like
Should I go and find a strip club or find Christ?
Lord, I need a skinny chick with fat lips
It ain't been a nigga repping this hard since fat Chris
Get it? I run Brooklyn like Big did it
Chick in my crib won't leave like Big spirit
I'm trying to get it and keep going
Audemar bright, can't hide it, keep glowing
All of my life been real, it keep showing
She said it's too big just [?]
I want it all, no pleasing him
This the mafia, screaming like Ceas' and 'em
My pants keep falling, I'm cheesing 'em
The hand of God get smacked by Jesus' son
So keep debating if I'm nice or not
While I'm debating should I fuck his wife or not
Let her bring a friend with her now, it's [?]
One room, two chick, dive in, why not?
I'm on that bullshit anyway
No license on the Rolls Royce anyway
Bedstuy we gone celebrate Biggie Day
March 9th, it's a big day everyday

[Verse 5: Fred the Godson]
I'm on track like the money train
I sold coke so the money came
Hold up, I sold coke soda, money came
Mother writing my uncle, she had to lick the stamp
No food in the fridge, they having liquor stamps
Had to go to the stripping land
Had to get my camp under [?], shit, forget the rent
[?] conviction, father fighting addiction
You gotta go like a tree, we gotta leave these conditions
What do you do when you look into an hourglass?
Whole team stitches, y'all start looking like [?]
Plus y'all know the block earning
Nevermind them shots burning
New body Tahoe, the block swerving
Since March 9th I never did like them box suburbans
He used to camp with me
Now I might light up his livingroom being that he used to lamp with me
Stop amping me, y'all nothing but some ants to me
Running around in the garden, come holla Anthony
But on some real shit
I'm who y'all go to when you wanna hear some shit
Now this the difference
I got a crib and a studio
Your crib is a studio, we got different rents
It's nothing, shit
My chain named Lim Kim cause its fucking big

[Verse 6: Joell Ortiz]
Who shot ya? You shot who? Answer the question
Questions better we answered or I'm advancing a weapon
When the weapons advancing everything stops
So stop everything or everything shot
I done shot everything, that's not a good look
I look good, write good hooks, I hook good
Have your hood shook, I shook hoods
Trust me, me trust anybody, never
Too many dudes change like the weather
I make the weather change, bring rain to your sweater
On a nice day give you a slight chill
Chill slightly with that ice grill
I grill ice and get it yap
Yap dudes who ain't get it
And clap at dudes who try to get it back
Getting back to this rap, I'm so nice
Nice so much, mucher the people prefer to hear it twice
I'm so nice, nice so much, mucher the people prefer to hear it twice
Get it?
It get ugly when I'm in a booth
Booths I get in get so hot they gotta build a sunroof
I roof sun chairs, one by one, yeah
She ain't wanting my sons, ain't no one on ones, kid
You get your clique jumped like Kriss Kross
Fam in the waiting room and all of their fingers kriss crossed
Double cross Chris nephew
Chris Wallace, me miss you
Pop Cristal for Jay, he kept Brooklyn official
When you bump into Christopher Rios
Tell Joell Christopher Ortiz is repping Puerto Rico
YAOWA[Lil' Cease]

Instantly we blaze trees, before these hoes swing low on Lil' Cease
The friskiest mc quick the mix D.C. and Pepsi
Have you broad trippin in my Ford Expedition listen
Diamonds and rhyming put me back on top
I pop wine with lime ins and the platinum drop
For players at them drop ya was like looking shorty chocolate roch
I suggest you jump out them clothes too
We can go on and on like Erykah Badu
Or we can get freaky in the Lex 450 while you lick me
I'm doing sixty quickly, females and black tails down they hustle up
Wanna cuddle up, you shy I'm your comforter, I know you love it huh
I make you feel right if it's real tight young ho' aight?


[The Notorious B.I.G.]

I make yo' mouthpiece obese like Della Reese
When I release you lose teeth like Little Cease
Player please blood floods your dungarees
And that's just the half for my warpath
Laugh now, cry later, I rhyme greater
Then the average player hater and spectators
Buy my CD twice they see me in the streets they be like ''yo he nice''
But that's on a low doe be the cats with no dough try to play me at my show
I pull out four fo's and go up in there clothes
Short change, slut came, abortion came quicker
Bought the range nigga. They still tickle me
I used to be as strong as ripple be, till Little Cease crippled me
Now I play hard like my girls nipples be
The game's sour like a pickle be, y'all know the rules
Moved from B.K. to New Jeruz
Thinking about all the plains we flew, females we ran through
Now the year's new I lay my game flat I want my spot back take two
Mad because I blew players envious to many players on my...
Shit strenuous when my men bust you just move with such stamina
Slugs missed ya' I ain't mad at ya' (we ain't mad at ya')
Slugs rushin barbassion(?) concussions
Catch cases come out frontin, smoking something
Sippin white Russians bitch in the Benz bumpin
Laced it with the basic six TV's a system knocking mase
Face it, we hard to hit, guard your shit, before I hit you
With your re-up light the P up, licked shots, woke your seed up
Went in the ashtray sparked the weed up, long-kiss


[The Notorious B.I.G.]

I'm flaming gats, aiming at, these...
Maniacs put my name in rap
So part the game is that like it hustle backwards
I smoke blackwoods and dutchies you can't touch me
Try to rush me, slugs go touchy touchy
You bleeding lovely with your spirit above me
Or beneath me your whole life you live sleepy
Now you rest internally sleepy, you burn when you creep me
Rest where the worms and the weak be
My nine flies baptize rap guys
With the holy ghost I put holes in most you hold your toast shaky
Flip and try to break me, look what you made me do
Brains blew my team in the marine-blue, six coupe
Skied it out weed it out...
*Laughing *


Yo man I can rhyme all night man
Ay ay do your thing!
I wanna curse man!
Ay do your thing man!
It's late man
Go ahead man
Ay just do your thing man, do your thing man


[The Notorious B.I.G.]

Niggas in my faction don't like asking questions
Strictly gun testing, coke measuring
Giving pleasure in the Benz-ito
Hitting fannies, spending chips at Mannies
Hope you creeps got receipts, my peeps get dirty like cleats
Run up in your crib, wrap you up in your Polo sheets
Six up in your wig piece, nigga decease
Mwa, may you rest in peace
With my Sycamore style, more sicker than yours
Four-four, and fifty-four draw
There's my pilot, steers my leer, yes my dear
Shit's official, only, the Feds I fear
Here's a tissue, stop your blood clot crying
The kids the dog, everybody dying -- no lying
So don't you get suspicious
I'm Big Dangerous you're just a little to Vicious
As I leave my competition, respirator style
Climb the ladder to success escalator style
Hold y'all breath, I told y'all -- death
Controls y'all, Big don't fold y'all, uhh
I spit phrases that'll thrill you
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you[Black Rob]
We gon' take this all around the world
