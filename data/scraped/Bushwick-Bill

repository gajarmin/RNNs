See, most of my life I never had shit
I felt like an outcast, treated like a misfit
Damn near didn't make it on my day of birth
Thinking was I really supposed to be on this planet earth
I take a deep breath, and then another follows
Cause hard shit is kinda hard to swallow
See, it's rough being a loner
Not knowing any given day and time I could wind up a goner
See, people got it bad from jump street
And being short is just another strike against me
I used to get funny looks cause I was small
And trying to make it was like running through a brick wall
Given the odds I was up against, bro
The average nigga would've quit a long time ago
But now I've got a record out
I'm doing shows, people paying to see me turn it out
Now I'm the spice around town
It's funny how an album can change a nigga's life around
I got friends and bitches on my dick
But when they look at Richard all they see is Bushwick
Sometimes I don't know a friend from a foe
And every different day it's a different fuckin ho
And now that my pockets are getting bigger
I'm meeting hoes who only wanna juice a nigga
They tell me that they love me and all that
But really they just wait for me to fall flat
So they can get me for my income
Take me for all I got, and then some
Like Trina, you dig
I fucked up and got too attached to the bitch's kid
Knowing that she used the baby to use me
Took him out my life, mentally abusing me
But as the time went by I got another slimmy
And she was just like the first one screaming "Gimme"
But not in the exact same way
She had a different type of game she liked to play
Her name was Crystal, she played the quiet type
And for a little while shit seemed alright
But just like the first ho, homie
When shit got hectic, the bitch broke out on me
And it's getting out of hand, gee
Cause nobody seems to understand me
Reminiscing got me feeling kinda low
I broke out the Ever-Clear and then I drunk some mo'
Until it was all gone
Now I'm looking for somebody to take my pain out on
But not just anybody, gee
I'mma take that on to Mica cause she's the closest to me
Full of that Ever-Clear and high on that buddah
Get to the house all I'm thinking 'bout is shooting her
Cause shooting her would be sweet
But you know what'd be sweeter? if I make her shoot me
Call me crazy, but that's what I'm thinking
I'm tripping, from all that smoking weed and drinking
But I knew she wouldn't do it on her own, so I provoked her
Punched her, kicked her, and chocked her
She still wouldn't grab the gun
And at that time I wasn't thinking about no one
Damn near crazy I went and grabbed the baby
Held him by the door and said I'mma throw his ass out, ho
She went to crying, somebody stop him
I said: you better grab the motherfucking gun or I'mma drop him
She snatched the baby out of my hands
We started fighting, punching, scratching, and biting
When we fell on the bed, check this shit
All kinds of crazy shit was going through my head
So I ran and got the gun and came back to her
Loaded it up and handed the gat to her
I grabbed her hand and placed the gun to my eye muscle
She screamed stop and then we broke into another tussle
Yo, during the fight the gun went off quick
Damn! Aw shit, I'm hit
("Aw... my eye, I can't see
Why you shoot me in the eye?
I would've shot you in the body
Why you shot me in the eye?")
Riding in the ambulance everything is hectic
I can't get a grip, I just can't check this
Everybody's crying, could it be I'm dying
Bullet in my head, in the bed was lying
Where's Mica? I wanna tell her I love her
With an IV in my arm I took a picture for an album cover
Goddamn, the shit's a trip, gee
5 different doctors with needles trying to stick me
I hear my family hollering he needs us
During the confusion, man, I seen Jesus
My mom's on the phone long-distance from New York
Here comes the doctors again trying to rip me apart
I got a monkey on my back, I can't shake it
I'm having suicidal thoughts, hoping that I don't make it
But I'mma make it cause something's steady urging me
5 hours passed, I made it through surgery
And the doctor said I wouldn't make it through the night
But god told me everything is gonna be alright
And I'm glad that I'm here, gee
But it's fucked up I had to lose an eye to see shit clearlyTHE CHRONIC [INTRO]

[Bushwick Bill]
Look into my eyes
Or should I say my eye
And nigga ya see just why
This can afraid to die
Ever since birth I've been givin' the short hand
It didn't hurt but it made me a smart man
And I kept my guards up, my head tight, my shit
Cocked, my heart stoned
The red light, my lips locked
Talking ain't squashin', nigga where I'm from
Nigga if you want some grab your gatt please
And I'm a end all your petty shit
Before you ever get to make it to your pump, you already lit
I spit round after round after round
Everybody hit the ground
Lookin' at death 'till my last slug
I show ya hoes what this drama is
Bring your family round this killa
And I'm peelin' all ya mama's kids
The more love, the more blood
Bitches rat-a-tat-tat on that hat 'till there's no slugs
Death ain't nothin' but a five letter word to me
And it's gonna be like that 'till somebody grab their
Gatt and try to murder me
Nigga, I don't give a fuck
If anybody killa in here, nigga where ya nuts?
It's the land of the lost
Slip one time, and ya bound to pay the cause
Nigga...
Now as I walk through the alley, I feel the shadow of death
My mind's on murder, my hand's on the tech
Whether Black, White, Asian, or Latin
Puerta Rican, never matter once I'm creepin' you know
Whats hapnin', fool
Kill or get killed, peel or get peeled
Either way though, blood's gonna spill
Buck me in my chest, buck me in my head
But you can't kill von Bushwicken motherfuckas
I'm already dead

(Murder him)Nigga I don't give a fuck
If anybody killa in here, nigga where ya nuts?
(Murder him)Fool I don't give a fuck
If anybody killa in here, nigga where ya nuts?
(Can we murder him)Bitch I don't give a fuck
If anybody killa in here, nigga where ya nuts?
(Straight murder him)Yo I don't give a fuck
If anybody killa in here, nigga where ya nuts?

I wake up every day to the agony, sufferin' and sorrow
Tragedies be havin' me too sad to see tomorrows
But I just say "Fuck it", take a deep breath
Get my heat set, and make the streets sweat
I get my kicks off the dodgin' and duckin'
That they do when they see me, my art, from bobbin' and buckin'
Once again I'm on a killing spree
I willingly load it and lock it and put them out they misery
If you don't know you better ax' somebody
How I blast these bitches like a black Jon Gotti
Now we find out that your not so slick
As the clock goes (*Tick*)
And the Glock goes (*Click*)
I show ya pussies what ya thinkin'
As your body becomes numb from the bullets that I'm blastin'
I ain't scared to get the red in these dreads
Meet me at the crossroads, muthafucka
I'm already dead

(Murder him)Nigga I don't give a fuck
If anybody killa in here, nigga where ya nuts?
(Shall we murder him)Fool I don't give a fuck
If anybody killa in here, nigga where ya nuts?
(Can we murder him)Bitch I don't give a fuck
If anybody killa in here, nigga where ya nuts?
(Straight murder him)Yo I don't give a fuck
If anybody killa in here, nigga where ya nuts?
(Straight murder him)I don't give a fuck
If anybody killa in here, fool where ya nuts?
(Straight murder him)I don't give a fuck
If anybody killa in here, nigga where ya nuts?
(Straight murder him)I don't give a fuck
If anybody killa in here, nigga where ya nuts?
(Straight murder him)Fool I don't give a fuck
If anybody killa in here, bitches where ya nuts?

Yeah, muthafuckas better watch out
Wolfgang VonBushwicken the Barbarian BillArtist: Bushwick Bill
Album: Phantom of the Rapra
Song: Who's the Biggest?

[Intro]
There was three little piggies and they all went to the market
And two short motherfuckas, hahaha
Chopped them down, because, uh
One little short motherfucka was born into greatness
Has obtained greatness, because his name is uh

Bushwick, aka Chuck, four foot eight and straight don't give a fuck
I got the strength of six men
With the heart to run up on a muthafucka six ten
I swear, I knows no fear, this labels me a threat
Throats get cut, niggas chests get wet
Some people say I got a short complex, that ain't true
But I got a short fuse so what's next?
Now we could go toe to toe or shoulder to nut
Either way it goes your getting fucked
Cause you trip and try to size me
And that type of shit just inspires me
I don't need no muthafuckin strap
We could get it on cause I feel I got a (?????)
Now you could fuck me up and I'mma still squab
Peelin' more caps than the motherfuckin mob

Chorus X3
Who the biggest, little motherfucker you know?
You the biggest, little motherfucka I know

I'm the biggest, little motherfucka you know
You the biggest, little motherfucker I know

Some ho nigga tried to play me out the box
[Now what you do that for?]
Now I got to knock your ass out
With the one, two jump to the chin
I'll wake your ass up and then knock your ass out again
That's what you get for tryin to test the Chuck black
A back full of dirt and my foot in your ass trick
I can't stand a muthafucka fulla talk
You pull his ho cord and he can't walk the walk
Don't let your eyes get bigger than your squabble
Thinkin' cause I'm small nigga, you can make me wobble
I got a punch as big as Streisands nose
Running motherfuckas like some panty hose
Shit, it takes two to tango
But one to get his ass kicked
Now I can get in that ass trick
Hitting motherfuckas up, Houston style
5th Ward motherfucker how you like me now?

Chorus X4

Now I'm eeny meeny miny fuckin mo
It seems nobody wants to fuck wit Chuck NO MOE!
Ever since I put the weight down
Ever sonce I broke a niggas jaw
Don't nobody wanna play now
First it was all good, and you were smilin
Until I broke your two front teeth, and now your whinin
I told you motherfuckas size ain't shit
I only wear size 5's but I still kick dents
You talk shit and I'mma beat that ass
You come weak and I'mma beat that ass
You play me cheap and I'mma beat that ass
And if cheatin bring ya heat then I'mma heat that ass trick
Don't ever underestimate a nigga with a giant size heart
And king size trigga finger
And don't ever fuck wit Wick
Cause I'm the biggest little motherfucka you know trick

Chorus X4[Bushwick Bill]
It's Bushwick Bill, I be that motherfuckin nigga
Four foot two, a couple of inches and I'm steady gettin bigger
Straight from the motherfuckin G
To the E to the T to the O, you know the spellin ho
I had to come up strong to get where I'm at
Moved by myself, I had nobody to watch my back
Back in the day I used to play with Tonka toys
Now I'm paid and shootin dice with the big boys
Shoot a G, bet a G, now watch me hit a lick
I ain't worryin about no shit because I packed my shit
I pull my shit and take a shit cause that's the way I do it
And when it comes to handlin shit, there ain't nothin to it
Bushwick Bill, the motherfuckin thinkin nigga
Gotta stay smart, to keep me from sinkin nigga
Cause if you sleep, you'll get beat, on the street
Understand, get it that's the plan, from the Little Big Man

(Yeah.. hahhh.. come again!  Uh, yeah..)
(Peep game)

[Bushwick Bill]
Now when it comes to bitches I play games with they minds
Cause once you get that hit, you gon' get the pussy any time
And it's a proven fact
I'm hittin bitches from the back, Bushwick Bill, neighborhood - mack
In and out the crib like a motel
Fucked her so well, the ho had to go.. tell
Her friend and then I fucked her too
Got 'em both claimin that they in love wit you know who
Now what am I to do, but pass her to the crew
And let the fellas get that ass and bust a couple of nuts or two
Cause that's the way we do it, fella
The Little Big Man, takin bitches to that other level!

(Yeah.. uh, uh, uh, ahh)

[Bushwick Bill]
How many motherfuckers wanna step to B-U-S-H
W-I-C-K, blowin niggas away, clickin every day
Cuttin niggas up, and I can not prevent the shit
Gougin out your fuckin eyeballs and then I skullfuck you, bitch
Hey nigga, don't you know, today's the first day
In the last moments of your life, run and tell your fuckin wife
Little nigga, little nigga, pullin trigger, gettin bigger
Gravedigger bury nigga like me how the fuck you figure
There's nothin worse than bein, caught up in a gridlock
With a fuckin dreadlock, cause you know I bust shot
Notty dread, notty dread, come slave driver
Buck 'em dead, buck 'em dead, Bushwick gettin liver
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up, BUCK, watch dem fall fast
Little Big Man, buck buck, bustin 'nuff ass!
Wheel it again Selector Diesel

Four five and year two t'ousand

And now with the following collection of ghoulish sounds
You can make your own sound terrifying and terrible Uh-huh-ha-ha! {*laughing*}

[Child's Play two sample]
Surprise! Heh-ha-heh-ha-ha-ha Did ya miss me? I sure missed you!
I told ya we're gonna be friends to the end and now it's time to play
I got a new game sport it's called hide the and guess what you're it!

[Verse One]
I told you size ain't shit you better duck quick
It's the replay of chucky part two call it chuckwick
Some niggas stay hard some niggas get sorrier
Insane as the war for the little 5th Ward warrior
Tonight's your dead date your dying a slow rate
Let's hope the chainsaw's inside of chuck for your heart's ache
Give me a knife I'm cutting bodies to pieces
Remember what happened to your mother fucking nieces
Niggas think I'm a ho but I'm letting them know
Every head I cut off half of that goes to Cujo
I cut a throat with a God damn stick
All bodies found dead fuck it blame it on Chuckwick

[Child's Play two sample]
It's Chuckwick Yaahh!
It's Chuckwick I told you he'd find me
He tried to take over my

[Verse Two]
The world's smallest killer I can't wait 'til they bury me
Every arm I chop off I give the fingers to charity
I saw a dead body just about my size
Razor blade to his face now I can see out both eyes
It's time for breakfast but I don't want eggs
Just jelly and toast and bacon and legs
If you try to diss that's fine with me
Hug this is that fine with you G?
Chuckwick Bill is from another dimension
Unsatisfied nigga with barbaric intention
Sometimes I'm invisible, sometimes I'm seen
Sometimes I'm a pitchfork, sometimes I'm guillotine
Extra ketchup on them French fried knees
No tomato on that chopper with cheese
I'm getting thirsty now what I'm a try
Gulp, gulp, mmmmmm blood dry!
You think I'm crazy you think I'm insane
Just because I wasn't born I was found on a fuckin' train
You wanna rumble well get up shit
If you buck you get fucked by that nigga named Chuckwick
Aw shit my nigga Ganksta Nip in the motherfuckin house
Yo Nip say something to all the people out there

[Ganksta Nip]
Yo this is Ganksta Nip
A South Park psycho takin no shit
And get your motherfuckin wig split

[Bushwick Bill]
Yeaahh! Chuckwick Bill ain't a sucka
Part one tripped y'all out part two is a motherfucker
Gimme some bob and I'll start by killing me
I'm dead so pass the bob G
And after that pass the body
Chuckwick Bill don't have the 5th ward John Gotti
You make me mad you're taking a fall
Tell your kids about my god damn Chuckwick Doll
Turn down and murder them hard
[Nip] What's the name of your hood?
[Bushwick Bil] 5th motherfucking ward!
The home of the villians constant killin
Get fired at your job start a new job car stealin
The word Chuckwick Capitalizes each letter
And we look as though we're two we took home room together
You might think that I'm throwed
A major malfunction made my brain explode
Which means I'm ready to slaughter
Syphilis and gonorrhea mixed up in your drinking water
Before I go I have this to say Hi!
My name is Chuckwick part three's on it's way

[Child's play two sample]
Snap out of it, you're acting like you've never seen a dead body before
This is it world, from now on, no Mr. Good guy
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! {*laughing continues*}(Do you have any idea who you're talkin to?)

[ VERSE 1 ]
The name of the game is gettin paid, gettin paid is the name
But there's some niggas out there doin some fucked up things
You shot another nigga for nothin
If I'mma shoot a muthafucka I'mma shoot his ass for somethin
Asked him did he have some money, he said no
He said the reason he shot him cause he was a straight up ho
The nigga stepped to you and you wasn't goin for it
So you killed him and got shit to show for it
Before you was a broke muthafucka, check it
But now you'se a broke muthafucka with a murder record
Did a killin just to prove you was a down nigga
But any nigga can pull the muthafuckin trigger
If you wanted to prove you can go
You shoulda put the muthafuckin gun away and went toe to toe
But you'se a ho, you couldn't go, so you shot first
Send another nigga ridin away in a hearse
And the judge gave you life on your first offense
But if it don't make dollars, man, then it don't make sense

[ VERSE 2 ]
I'm standin on the corner, tryin to feel my money clip
Hopin that one of these geekers don't start to trip
From down the street comes Baby G
The muthafucka always wants somethin for free
The nigga asked me to see a dime
Dig it, I had the feelin I was gonna get jacked all the time
He snatched my dimes and tried to make the block
I squeezed my trigger and let off six or seven shots
Been knowin G ever since he was a little baby
He started smokin and the muthafucka went crazy
Man, I hate it had to end that way
But fuckin with my money, G, you know I don't play
Why can't you fools just take a hint
Cause if it don't make dollars, man, it just don't make sense
[ VERSE 3 ]
He wants to be a big man, got everybody thinkin he's in control
Out there frontin just to impress them hoes
Talkin like he got it goin on so much
Not knowin he was settin himself up
Claimin he's the biggest on the block
Say he's movin ki's when he's really sellin rocks
Big talk from a small time sucker
Got everybody watchin him, includin them undercovers
Got them white folks thinkin he's a kingpin
And they wanna send his ass to the federal pen
All that talk got his ass thrown smooth in jail
Now he's tryin to tell the truth, about how much he sells
But them white folks ain't even listenin, gee
To them you're just one more nigger off the street
They gave him cases he ain't have nothin to do with
And now he realize his frontin don't pay shit
Now all he can do is reminisce
Cause if it don't make dollars, fool, it just don't make senseAnd um...
Look, listen and observe
As we all pay close attention um..

(Straight murder him)I don't give a fuck
If anybody killa in here, nigga where ya nuts?
(Straight murder him)I don't give a fuck
If anybody killa in here, nigga where ya nuts?
(Straight murder him)Fool I don't give a fuck
If anybody killa in here, bitches where ya nuts?

[Bushwick]
Yeah, muthafuckas better watch out
Wolfgang VonBushwicken the Barbarian Bill[Intro]
And now with the following collection of ghoulish sounds
You can make your own sound terrifying and terrible Uh-huh-ha-ha! {*laughing*}

[Child's Play two sample]
Surprise! Heh-ha-heh-ha-ha-ha Did ya miss me? I sure missed you!
I told ya we're gonna be friends to the end and now it's time to play
I got a new game sport it's called hide the and guess what you're it!

[Verse One]
I told you size ain't shit you better duck quick
It's the replay of chucky part two call it chuckwick
Some niggas stay hard some niggas get sorrier
Insane as the war for the little 5th Ward warrior
Tonight's your dead date your dying a slow rate
Let's hope the chainsaw's inside of chuck for your heart's ache
Give me a knife I'm cutting bodies to pieces
Remember what happened to your mother fucking nieces
Niggas think I'm a ho but I'm letting them know
Every head I cut off half of that goes to Cujo
I cut a throat with a God damn stick
All bodies found dead fuck it blame it on Chuckwick

[Child's Play two sample]
It's Chuckwick Yaahh!
It's Chuckwick I told you he'd find me
He tried to take over my

[Verse Two]
The world's smallest killer I can't wait 'til they bury me
Every arm I chop off I give the fingers to charity
I saw a dead body just about my size
Razor blade to his face now I can see out both eyes
It's time for breakfast but I don't want eggs
Just jelly and toast and bacon and legs
If you try to diss that's fine with me
Hug this is that fine with you G?
Chuckwick Bill is from another dimension
Unsatisfied nigga with barbaric intention
Sometimes I'm invisible, sometimes I'm seen
Sometimes I'm a pitchfork, sometimes I'm guillotine
Extra ketchup on them French fried knees
No tomato on that chopper with cheese
I'm getting thirsty now what I'm a try
Gulp, gulp, mmmmmm blood dry!
You think I'm crazy you think I'm insane
Just because I wasn't born I was found on a fuckin' train
You wanna rumble well get up shit
If you buck you get fucked by that nigga named Chuckwick
Aw shit my nigga Ganksta Nip in the motherfuckin house
Yo Nip say something to all the people out there

[Ganksta Nip]
Yo this is Ganksta Nip
A South Park psycho takin no shit
And get your motherfuckin wig split

[Bushwick Bill]
Yeaahh! Chuckwick Bill ain't a sucka
Part one tripped y'all out part two is a motherfucker
Gimme some bob and I'll start by killing me
I'm dead so pass the bob G
And after that pass the body
Chuckwick Bill don't have the 5th ward John Gotti
You make me mad you're taking a fall
Tell your kids about my god damn Chuckwick Doll
Turn down and murder them hard
[Nip] What's the name of your hood?
[Bushwick Bil] 5th motherfucking ward!
The home of the villians constant killin
Get fired at your job start a new job car stealin
The word Chuckwick Capitalizes each letter
And we look as though we're two we took home room together
You might think that I'm throwed
A major malfunction made my brain explode
Which means I'm ready to slaughter
Syphilis and gonorrhea mixed up in your drinking water
Before I go I have this to say Hi!
My name is Chuckwick part three's on it's way

[Child's play two sample]
Snap out of it, you're acting like you've never seen a dead body before
This is it world, from now on, no Mr. Good guy
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! {*laughing continues*}[ VERSE 1 ]
Money, money, money, muthafuckin green
Reach inside my pocket, I don't feel it, and I wanna scream
Nigga, give it up, cause I want every penny in your pocket
And your ass is goin down if you tell me you ain't got it
I gotta make a profit in that Nickel Ward
Cause I ain't with bein broke and times are gettin hard
I pull the gat and hit the boulevard huntin for a victim
Catch him slippin, pop the clip in, and then I get him
When in mama's womb I was doomed, destined for poverty
And no nigga in the ghetto about to win a lottery
So what does it bother me to knock a nigga off?
I'm educated, in a robbery, bitch, I'm the boss
Mr. Lawman is quick to call this action a crime
Because they can't tax robbery, they don't get a dime
Everything'd be fine if I was working 9 to 5
But I can't get that kinda job, I ain't 5 ft. high
Since they don't realize that my size ain't shit
I'm gonna gaffle em and baffle em until my bank gets
To the maximum, I get the gat then i'm after them fast
Goin for bad, goin from copper to cash

Some people will try to jack you
Some people will even kill you
So give it to em, y'all

[ VERSE 2 ]
When I started writin lyrics it was like a religion to me
Cause when I seen the mic, you're fuckin right, I was kickin it, gee
Knew that it was somethin that was gonna last a lifetime
When I pushed my homework aside so I could write rhymes
I sat in class hypnotized, my mind in a daze
Pretendin Bushwick Bill rippin up a stage
But back in the days Little Bill was soft as jello
And hard work pays, now I'm the hardest muthafucka in the ghetto
I assured I got the rhymes that was popular at times
But I hadn't got my name on the dotted line
I couldn't pay the dime, mama worked parttime
It made me so mad, I sat down and wrote hard rhymes
I ??? cause I couldn't pay the fee
Then my boy gave me a ki, in a week I made a g
Pretty soon I was laughin in a mansion makin profits
Puttin half in the bank, keepin half in my pockets
Cops were hopin, cops were hopin they could get me net
They be promoted to a captain for the big arrest
I wasn't slippin, I was givin the blues the blues
Cause I refused to lose, I grabbed the booze and cruised
Up the avenue, laughin at the people in school
Cause they broke as a muthafucka talkin bout a golden rule
You're sayin I'm a fool for droppin out
I'm makin millions, well daddy, what you're talkin bout?
I remember scrapin up pennies for the 4-double oz's
Now my refigerator's full of Olde E
I used to only rap on the schoolyard
Now I'm in the studio droppin lyrics too hard
I took the road to the riches in a dash
Left my competators at last, they run from copper to cash

Some people will try to jack you
Some people will even kill you
So give it to em, y'all

[ VERSE 3 ]
A lotta people didn't think that it could happen
They all started laughin when I told em I'd be rappin
But now I'm cashin in big checks from the Rap-A-Lot
Bill's gettin paid, now it's my turn to laugh a lot
I live the life that a lotta niggas dream of
I sit back and smoke cess in a steam tub
I got bitches and bitches and bitches and bitches
And more bitches on my dick, they like the size of my pockets
But I ain't cuttin for a stinky piece of pearl tongue
She makes a move for my wallet, and the girl's hung
Cause when you're broke, you're a joke, but when you get cash
Them muthafuckin stink hoes want half
So all of you funky-ass hoes can kiss
My Geto-Boy-midget-mind-of-a-lunatic-
Fuck-a-war-can't-be-stopped-size-ain't-shit-
Other-level-rap-a-lot-copper-to-cash-dick
But if you just wanna fuck me
Yeah aight, aight, you can suck a nigga's Chuckie

Some people will try to jack you
Some people will even kill you
So give it to em, y'all(Do you have any idea who you're talkin to?)

[ VERSE 1 ]
The name of the game is gettin paid, gettin paid is the name
But there's some niggas out there doin some fucked up things
You shot another nigga for nothin
If I'mma shoot a muthafucka I'mma shoot his ass for somethin
Asked him did he have some money, he said no
He said the reason he shot him cause he was a straight up ho
The nigga stepped to you and you wasn't goin for it
So you killed him and got shit to show for it
Before you was a broke muthafucka, check it
But now you'se a broke muthafucka with a murder record
Did a killin just to prove you was a down nigga
But any nigga can pull the muthafuckin trigger
If you wanted to prove you can go
You shoulda put the muthafuckin gun away and went toe to toe
But you'se a ho, you couldn't go, so you shot first
Send another nigga ridin away in a hearse
And the judge gave you life on your first offense
But if it don't make dollars, man, then it don't make sense

[ VERSE 2 ]
I'm standin on the corner, tryin to feel my money clip
Hopin that one of these geekers don't start to trip
From down the street comes Baby G
The muthafucka always wants somethin for free
The nigga asked me to see a dime
Dig it, I had the feelin I was gonna get jacked all the time
He snatched my dimes and tried to make the block
I squeezed my trigger and let off six or seven shots
Been knowin G ever since he was a little baby
He started smokin and the muthafucka went crazy
Man, I hate it had to end that way
But fuckin with my money, G, you know I don't play
Why can't you fools just take a hint
Cause if it don't make dollars, man, it just don't make sense
[ VERSE 3 ]
He wants to be a big man, got everybody thinkin he's in control
Out there frontin just to impress them hoes
Talkin like he got it goin on so much
Not knowin he was settin himself up
Claimin he's the biggest on the block
Say he's movin ki's when he's really sellin rocks
Big talk from a small time sucker
Got everybody watchin him, includin them undercovers
Got them white folks thinkin he's a kingpin
And they wanna send his ass to the federal pen
All that talk got his ass thrown smooth in jail
Now he's tryin to tell the truth, about how much he sells
But them white folks ain't even listenin, gee
To them you're just one more nigger off the street
They gave him cases he ain't have nothin to do with
And now he realize his frontin don't pay shit
Now all he can do is reminisce
Cause if it don't make dollars, fool, it just don't make senseSee, most of my life I never had shit
I felt like an outcast, treated like a misfit
Damn near didn't make it on my day of birth
Thinking was I really supposed to be on this planet earth
I take a deep breath, and then another follows
Cause hard shit is kinda hard to swallow
See, it's rough being a loner
Not knowing any given day and time I could wind up a goner
See, people got it bad from jump street
And being short is just another strike against me
I used to get funny looks cause I was small
And trying to make it was like running through a brick wall
Given the odds I was up against, bro
The average nigga would've quit a long time ago
But now I've got a record out
I'm doing shows, people paying to see me turn it out
Now I'm the spice around town
It's funny how an album can change a nigga's life around
I got friends and bitches on my dick
But when they look at Richard all they see is Bushwick
Sometimes I don't know a friend from a foe
And every different day it's a different fuckin ho
And now that my pockets are getting bigger
I'm meeting hoes who only wanna juice a nigga
They tell me that they love me and all that
But really they just wait for me to fall flat
So they can get me for my income
Take me for all I got, and then some
Like Trina, you dig
I fucked up and got too attached to the bitch's kid
Knowing that she used the baby to use me
Took him out my life, mentally abusing me
But as the time went by I got another slimmy
And she was just like the first one screaming "Gimme"
But not in the exact same way
She had a different type of game she liked to play
Her name was Crystal, she played the quiet type
And for a little while shit seemed alright
But just like the first ho, homie
When shit got hectic, the bitch broke out on me
And it's getting out of hand, gee
Cause nobody seems to understand me
Reminiscing got me feeling kinda low
I broke out the Ever-Clear and then I drunk some mo'
Until it was all gone
Now I'm looking for somebody to take my pain out on
But not just anybody, gee
I'mma take that on to Mica cause she's the closest to me
Full of that Ever-Clear and high on that buddah
Get to the house all I'm thinking 'bout is shooting her
Cause shooting her would be sweet
But you know what'd be sweeter? if I make her shoot me
Call me crazy, but that's what I'm thinking
I'm tripping, from all that smoking weed and drinking
But I knew she wouldn't do it on her own, so I provoked her
Punched her, kicked her, and chocked her
She still wouldn't grab the gun
And at that time I wasn't thinking about no one
Damn near crazy I went and grabbed the baby
Held him by the door and said I'mma throw his ass out, ho
She went to crying, somebody stop him
I said: you better grab the motherfucking gun or I'mma drop him
She snatched the baby out of my hands
We started fighting, punching, scratching, and biting
When we fell on the bed, check this shit
All kinds of crazy shit was going through my head
So I ran and got the gun and came back to her
Loaded it up and handed the gat to her
I grabbed her hand and placed the gun to my eye muscle
She screamed stop and then we broke into another tussle
Yo, during the fight the gun went off quick
Damn! Aw shit, I'm hit
("Aw... my eye, I can't see
Why you shoot me in the eye?
I would've shot you in the body
Why you shot me in the eye?")
Riding in the ambulance everything is hectic
I can't get a grip, I just can't check this
Everybody's crying, could it be I'm dying
Bullet in my head, in the bed was lying
Where's Mica? I wanna tell her I love her
With an IV in my arm I took a picture for an album cover
Goddamn, the shit's a trip, gee
5 different doctors with needles trying to stick me
I hear my family hollering he needs us
During the confusion, man, I seen Jesus
My mom's on the phone long-distance from New York
Here comes the doctors again trying to rip me apart
I got a monkey on my back, I can't shake it
I'm having suicidal thoughts, hoping that I don't make it
But I'mma make it cause something's steady urging me
5 hours passed, I made it through surgery
And the doctor said I wouldn't make it through the night
But god told me everything is gonna be alright
And I'm glad that I'm here, gee
But it's fucked up I had to lose an eye to see shit clearlyEverybody dies!
Everybody dies!

[Verse 1: Madrox]
Patchwork, sewn together from dues to dirt
From earthgrown and weather conditions of the desert
And everyone's a part of it, Some more then others
Sons, daughters, and brothers, lawyers, accountants and even grandmothers
New comers and old faces, people of any races, and familiar places
Parents and teachers, prostitutes and preachers
Throw ya hands to the sky and pray that he can see us
Living how we gotta live, and doing what we gotta do
Praying for another day so we can fight and make it through
Some of us are designed for crimes, some of us designed for rhymes
Still we congregate in unemployment lines
One of a kind, and still kinda strange, same book same world
Just we on another page, one more time
One of a kind, and still kinda strange, same book same world

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Come on, We on another page
(Everybody dies!)
Come on, We on another page
(Everybody dies!)

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
Once I lit a smoke off a bitch I fried
And I ashed it in her face when she died
Who you bitches you calling regular when you out of my zone
Like a celluar phone that's stuck on roam, now get ya mind blown
That's me and my man at your door, and we looking for a reason to start the war
You should of never tried to take a stab at us
And you NEVER should of rapped on us
We see the game from way the others hurried and rush
We broke them down, rolled them up, sparked the flame
And smoked them all in the dust - what?
You couldn't touch me bitch, not even if you wanted
Bitch I'll have your whole block haunted
Flaunt us like the bees in your chilli, we all know the really really
Monoxide slap your girlfriend silly
Big Willie get your throat cut and left bleeding
While my homeboy's banging your girl, while ya leaving

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Bushwick Bill]
What ya lookin at, where ya bitch at?
I'll make her bounce on til the back's up
Thinking your something that your other playas tap off
Holes in your stomach, til your whole waist snap off
Pour out some coiagnac, bite the bottle cap off
Hate it with a passion when a bitch nigga act off
Ride on ya hood everyday and never slack off
Never let it get squash, never let it slide
Die muthafucka die muthafucka die

[Verse 4: Anybody Killa]
Flip through a couple pages, looking into my background
All you see is the dead around
Daddy always said there'd be days like this
Now daddy's dead and gone cause he wans granted his only wish
I can't believe all the drama when it comes to death
Ain't nothing you can do but pay respect
Slip into the afterlife, feeling light as a feather
Everybody dies, so quit acting like you live forever

[Hook][Bushwick Bill]
It's Bushwick Bill, I be that motherfuckin nigga
Four foot two, a couple of inches and I'm steady gettin bigger
Straight from the motherfuckin G
To the E to the T to the O, you know the spellin ho
I had to come up strong to get where I'm at
Moved by myself, I had nobody to watch my back
Back in the day I used to play with Tonka toys
Now I'm paid and shootin dice with the big boys
Shoot a G, bet a G, now watch me hit a lick
I ain't worryin about no shit because I packed my shit
I pull my shit and take a shit cause that's the way I do it
And when it comes to handlin shit, there ain't nothin to it
Bushwick Bill, the motherfuckin thinkin nigga
Gotta stay smart, to keep me from sinkin nigga
Cause if you sleep, you'll get beat, on the street
Understand, get it that's the plan, from the Little Big Man

(Yeah.. hahhh.. come again!  Uh, yeah..)
(Peep game)

[Bushwick Bill]
Now when it comes to bitches I play games with they minds
Cause once you get that hit, you gon' get the pussy any time
And it's a proven fact
I'm hittin bitches from the back, Bushwick Bill, neighborhood - mack
In and out the crib like a motel
Fucked her so well, the ho had to go.. tell
Her friend and then I fucked her too
Got 'em both claimin that they in love wit you know who
Now what am I to do, but pass her to the crew
And let the fellas get that ass and bust a couple of nuts or two
Cause that's the way we do it, fella
The Little Big Man, takin bitches to that other level!

(Yeah.. uh, uh, uh, ahh)

[Bushwick Bill]
How many motherfuckers wanna step to B-U-S-H
W-I-C-K, blowin niggas away, clickin every day
Cuttin niggas up, and I can not prevent the shit
Gougin out your fuckin eyeballs and then I skullfuck you, bitch
Hey nigga, don't you know, today's the first day
In the last moments of your life, run and tell your fuckin wife
Little nigga, little nigga, pullin trigger, gettin bigger
Gravedigger bury nigga like me how the fuck you figure

With a fuckin dreadlock, cause you know I bust shot

And buy 'em flowers, too
If I was you
I wouldn't leave from around your crew
They wouldn't find you til the year 2002
I'll be countin' loot
Climbin' like a mountain boot
In the land where dope fiends play the glass flutes
Off in the night, at the scene stackin' green
While most men sleep, we servin' fiend after fiend
'86, breakin' bricks
Got hoes takin' tricks
Makin' hits
While I'm at Denny's, eating steak and grits
Bring the noise to you boys
Feel my Hillwood Opera

So every full moon, I dance with wolves
Used to fool with crack
Now I'm through with that
I just opened up the SPM School Of Rap
Jump for joy, H-Town
The south takin' over
Like when they mixed weed with a cup of baking soda
Playin' poker
Breakin' boulders
Shake your shoulders
Make you haters know this, that your silly game is bogus
Can't control us
We stay ferocious
But lay the lowest
Blaze a forest
My brain's in orbit
And they adored us
Great performance
I'm playin' organs
And pray the Lord's
Kickin' like Bruce, takin' all this
Now bring the chorus

Talkin' 'bout them power moves
Power moves
Hey!
Power moves
Power moves[Intro]
Doctor Wolfgang I heard you was a mastermind of crimes baby
And I'd like you to break it down for me
And have a nigga know about the criminal aspects
And it's subliminal criminal aspect of a brother's life and all that ...
Man, nigga you need to get in, get out and get something
(I need some of that muthafunkin dollarbill)
Nigga what, ain't nobody given me no handouts (break it down for me)
Yeah I'mma tell you how it goes

[Verse 1: Bushwick Bill]
It ain't your average crime, it fits one of mines
I tried to warn 'em at first but I've got to prove it this time
They call me Chuck Wick, the Fifth Ward hard crippler
Niggas think I'm the devil, bitches hail me like Hitler
But still, I'm real with these skills that I've mastered
Peelin your caps backwards so I've never been captured
So I'm physically and mentally relentless
I live for the killing, and Chuckie's my accomplice
And me, I'm a psycho coma
Killer with the skills, releasin these tales of drama
That fuck around and sell a million copies still
Motherfucking coppers wanna watch me chill
That lets me know I'm on they brain
So they're never out my range, cause I'm shootin like Danny Ainge
Dumpin two clips minimal, now I'm at your funeral
Should've never fucked with the subliminal criminal

[Hook]
It's the subliminal criminals at the door
The enemies didn't know they had a loaded 4-4
And he's cockin his Glock, each one is gon' drop
(and your wicked) just can't be stopped

[Verse 2: Sherm]
Well it's Sherm, who dat comin up to the bath, as I rat-tat-tat-tat
Grab yo gat and watch your fucking back
This ain't no ho-gang, bitch, it's on the real
So you best to be packin your steel, or you bitch be getting killed
Jackings and robberies ain't nothin but hobbies
So you best to check your vest and don't be rollin by me sloppy
Cos I'mma jack you, fool I'mma get you
9 millimeter spray hit you bitch and let ya split ya
So knuckle down or motherfucker knuckle up
'Bout to get fucked all that Chucks
So don't push your motherfucking luck
357, 9 millimeter, or the Tec-9 shine
If I see bitch-made pulling next to me I can be goin for mine
Old-school motherfucker, but I'm only 18
Steppin hard for the scene, in '95 you gon' see what I mean
Fillin up the hospital, stressin out my mental
So say what's up to a subliminal criminal

[Outro]
Dr. Wolfgang Von Bushwicken The Barbarian Mother-funky StayHigh Dollar Billster
Is gonna break down what makes up a subliminal criminal
And why it's a white-collar crime
[ "Subliminal" ]: below the threshold of conscious perception
Inadequate to produce conscious awareness
[ "Criminal" ]: of evolvin or havin the nature of a person
Who has committed or being legally convicted guilty of a crime
It is shameful and disgraceful that you don't know what time it isTHE CHRONIC [INTRO]

Times that is hard as a 21 years
Ain't got a dime and ain't seen a chick in a year
I'm catching drama from my mama on down
It's rough as fuck, but homie, I'm staying down
Now I have done everything from Everclear to sherman sticks
I sold dope around town
I'd stomp niggas down
Rolling through my hood like a superstar
Turning corner after corner in my brand new cars
These hoes used to call me baller
But that was 'fore I lost my grip, now they barely even call a
Player cause they know I'm broke
No Rolex and no Benz, just spokes (shit)
Now that I'm back to life, and that I'm back to reality
Got one life which ain't shit without a salary
I'm spitting game so y'all can feel me
Man, I'mma make it out the ghetto if it kills me
And Lil' Jay will make it real
Y'all know the deal

[ Verse 2 ]
Now if it wasn't for moms I wouldn't have no world
You stood tall through it all, so you go, girl
I know things ain't all they used to be
I had to slow my roll, see, trouble's getting used to me
I gots to make you a proud mother
No more crack slanging, I gots to be a proud brother
And take control of my destiny
I can't let these streets get the best of me
It's kinda rough starting over but it's worth the pain
Instead of getting stuck with the same ol' same
Stretched like a rubberband, busting flicks
In the pen for life with some off-brand tricks
Ain't nobody knowin about the pain you feel
I'mma change my life, mama, that's on the real
I pray to God He make you feel me
Man, I'mma make it out the ghetto if it kill me
And mama, that's real

[ Verse 3 ]
No more playing mack daddy for you skeezers
I got one lover, I love her, so I'mma please her
And leave you tramps alone
Since I'm getting shit straight, I'm starting at home
Now which one of y'all was down and didn't clown when I was sleeping on the flo'
My real girl, that's who, that's why I love her so
Got two sons and no daughters
I'm barely feeding both of my kids but I still gots to be a father
That I used to want pops to be
This ain't no dis to ya, pops, cause you're still my g
I'm on a long road to nowhere if I don't change
Life with no crime on my mind feels strange
Working like a motherfucker, slick like a Benz seat
Backing off my old hustle, trying to make these ends meet
I pray to God he make you feel me
Man, I'mma make it out the ghetto if it kills me
And niggas, that's real[Intro: Scarface]
"Ladies and gentlemen...
Ladies and gentlemen... let's get together
And give a great big round of applause to
To a new group..." [Scarface laughing so loud sample is obscured]
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh shit
Scarface is on the mix
So yo, suck a nigga dick
Or make a nigga rich, or somethin, BITCH

[Verse 1: Scarface]
See I come from the place known as the South Park Zone
Talkin shit ain't in the clique, and take your punk ass home
Cause I'm the type of nigga down, chump
Hit you in the chest with a motherfuckin tec and watch you jump
So die motherfuckers die motherfuckers die
Look deep into the eyes of a killer smokin' fry
One nigga you can't fuck wit
Cause I'm a born killer with the mind of a lunatic
So bring in bodybags when I start bangin
Cause I'm leavin motherfuckers laid out, with they brains hangin
Straight gettin down for mine
And I'll fuck up a bitch, cause I don't mind dyin'
So feel me drill me, put a bullet in my head, but yo
You can't kill me, cause I'm already dead
Scarface goin psycho, yeah
Play pussy, get fucked and take two to your head

[Verse 2: Bushwick Bill]
I'm Bushwick Bill, but call me Chuckie
5th Ward hard bitch, play hero and buck me
Cause I'm known to pull your skull out
Grip a motherfucker by his neck and gouge his fuckin eyes out
I'm insane by a longshot, hey
Chuckwick Bill, a.k.a. Charles Lee Ray
A short nigga with some lonnnnng nuts
Drop you dead in your bed now I'm ready for a long fuck
Necromance that ass for a minute
And split that motherfuckin clique when I'm finished
You punk bitches be retreatin
Freddy and Jason runnin home with their mouths bleedin
So welcome to the Slaughterhouse, champ
5th Ward Texas, Chuckie's Concentration Camp
You punk motherfuckers fled
And those who didn't make it got two to the fuckin head

[Verse 3: Ice Cube]
Buck 'em down, buck 'em down, come again
Two to the chin, Ice Cube'll blast they ass till the end
With my pistol, runnin from Da Lench Mob
Is How You Survive in South Central
Kick the instrumental, run and get your bigger crew
Cause it's Judgment Day, and Ice Cube is Terminigga 2
Pow pow buck buck pow buck
Your name is Stucky Mack, now you realize that you're fucked
Two to the brain, I leave a migraine
Have you droolin like a vegetable, but you're not edible
It's the incredible, buck your ass from head to toe
Audi 5000, don't wait for the Feds to show
Cause they'll have me go up, up the river
Where the white boys'll try to make a nigga
Walk, walk the plank, got the shank, hide the tape
Around the handle, gotta let em know what I stand for
In the chow line, now is the time
See the trustee, walk up from behind
Real quick shank shank, leave his ass red
Motherfucker dead, from two to the head

[Verse 4: Kool G Rap]
See where I come from the crime rate only rises
The murderers disguise in all ages shapes and sizes
Bitches picked up and dicked up, niggas they gettin stuck up
Give up what you got, or get your ass shot the fuck up
Run em down and gun em down, yeah that's how we do it
Niggas get killed, and then filled with embalming fluid
Step to the niggas that I'm checkin
Pull out the tec and I reckon you'll get murdered in a second
Bang with the nine, boom with the pound
Motherfuckers are fallin and crawlin on the ground
Snitches get stitches, bitches that act snotty
Inside the parties even the hotties get turned to bodies
Now I heard, they got other places that's similar
But I represent New York, you fuck around I'm killin ya
A whole block of cops patrollin when I'm rollin
And if my pockets are swollen you know somebody's shit got stolen
Yeah you niggas get ripped, when my clip, goes in the
S-M-I-T-H W-E-Double-S-O-N
Or the reliable revolver
And like I said before, it's the motherfuckin problem solver
So bring it on nigga, get brave
It's plenty motherfuckers gettin sent to early graves
Cause when a nigga gets fed
Then all you motherfuckers get two to the fuckin headArtist: Bushwick Bill

Song: Who's the Biggest?

[Intro]
There was three little piggies and they all went to the market
And two short motherfuckas, hahaha
Chopped them down, because, uh
One little short motherfucka was born into greatness
Has obtained greatness, because his name is uh

Bushwick, aka Chuck, four foot eight and straight don't give a fuck
I got the strength of six men
With the heart to run up on a muthafucka six ten
I swear, I knows no fear, this labels me a threat
Throats get cut, niggas chests get wet
Some people say I got a short complex, that ain't true
But I got a short fuse so what's next?
Now we could go toe to toe or shoulder to nut
Either way it goes your getting fucked
Cause you trip and try to size me
And that type of shit just inspires me
I don't need no muthafuckin strap
We could get it on cause I feel I got a (?????)
Now you could fuck me up and I'mma still squab
Peelin' more caps than the motherfuckin mob

Chorus X3
Who the biggest, little motherfucker you know?
You the biggest, little motherfucka I know

I'm the biggest, little motherfucka you know
You the biggest, little motherfucker I know

Some ho nigga tried to play me out the box
[Now what you do that for?]
Now I got to knock your ass out
With the one, two jump to the chin
I'll wake your ass up and then knock your ass out again
That's what you get for tryin to test the Chuck black
A back full of dirt and my foot in your ass trick
I can't stand a muthafucka fulla talk
You pull his ho cord and he can't walk the walk
Don't let your eyes get bigger than your squabble
Thinkin' cause I'm small nigga, you can make me wobble
I got a punch as big as Streisands nose
Running motherfuckas like some panty hose
Shit, it takes two to tango
But one to get his ass kicked
Now I can get in that ass trick
Hitting motherfuckas up, Houston style
5th Ward motherfucker how you like me now?

Chorus X4

Now I'm eeny meeny miny fuckin mo
It seems nobody wants to fuck wit Chuck NO MOE!
Ever since I put the weight down
Ever sonce I broke a niggas jaw
Don't nobody wanna play now
First it was all good, and you were smilin
Until I broke your two front teeth, and now your whinin
I told you motherfuckas size ain't shit
I only wear size 5's but I still kick dents
You talk shit and I'mma beat that ass
You come weak and I'mma beat that ass
You play me cheap and I'mma beat that ass
And if cheatin bring ya heat then I'mma heat that ass trick
Don't ever underestimate a nigga with a giant size heart
And king size trigga finger
And don't ever fuck wit Wick
Cause I'm the biggest little motherfucka you know trick

I dare, I knows no fear, this labels me a threat
Throats get cut, niggas chests get wet. (Throats get cut)
Some people say I got a short complex, that ain't true! (that ain't true!)
But I got a short fuse so what's next?
Now we could go toe to toe or shoulder to nut
Either way it goes your getting fucked
Cause you trip and try to size me
And that type of shit just inspires me
I don't need no motherfucking strap
We could get it on cause i feel i got a real cool scrap
Now you could fuck me up and I'mma still squab
Peelin' more caps than the motherfucking mob

(Chorus x2)
Who the biggest, little motherfucker you know?
(CJ) You the biggest, little motherfucker I know
I'm the biggest, little motherfucker you know
(CJ) You the biggest, little motherfucker I know

Some ho nigga tried to play me out the box
Now what you do that for?

That's what you get for trying to test the Chuck black
A back full of dirt and my foot in your ass trick

Running motherfuckers like some panty hose

Shit, it takes two to tango
But one to get his ass kicked
Now I can get in that ass trick
Hitting motherfuckers up, Houston style
5th Ward motherfucker how you like me now?

[Hook x2]

Now I'm eeny-meeny-miny-fucking-mo
It seems nobody wants to fuck with Chuck no more
Ever since I put the weight down
Ever since I broke a niggas jaw
Don't nobody wanna play now
First it was all good, and you were smiling
Until I broke your two front teeth, and now your whining
I told you motherfuckers size ain't shit
I only wear size 5's but I still kick dents
You talk shit and I'mma beat that ass
You come weak and I'mma beat that ass
You play me cheap and I'mma beat that ass
And if cheating bring ya heat then I'mma heat that ass trick
Don't ever underestimate a nigga with a giant size heart
And king size trigger finger
And don't ever fuck with Wick
Cause I'm the biggest little motherfucker you know trick

[Hook x2][ *guy mocking Bushwick Bill* ]
You know that little short muthafuckin Bushwick?
Shit, he so goddamn short
He had to get a runnin start and jump up on the commode to take a shit
He can't even piss - he can't even piss without runnin all the way back
Squeezin his little dick!
He went to the movie, they was gonna let him in the movie free
But he had razorbumps, short muthafucka!
I was gonna give him a ride in my goddamn car
But I forgot my car seat!
Little nasty muthafucka, you know what I'm sayin?
This some old bitch..
(Yo, there he is right now)
(Yo what's up, Bushwick?)
[ Bushwick Bill ]
Cock this
( *shots* )

[ VERSE 1 ]
Bushwick Bill is on the goddamn hunt with a 12-guage pump
Sendin muthafuckas to the dump
The nigga killa, known to slam a ho
Finger on the trigger, lettin the hammer go
Boom-boom, back up while I'm gettin hype, bitch
Cause you ain't ready for an ass-whippin like this
I'm on a killing spree, lettin muthafuckas see
Me and the G.B. steady makin history
Some crazy niggas out of Houston goin platinum
Send up a gang of muthafuckas, watch me gat one
Bar a bitch cause he's bigger, how the fuck you figure
I thought you knew this was a goddamn slaughter, nigga
I'm sendin sons of bitches to the pavement
And the shit won't stop until I say when
One by one they hit the muthafuckin ground, see
Call it what you want, nigga, yeah, but you can callme crazy

[ (crowd chanting), Bushwick Bill ]
(Why you wanna fuck with Bushwick, you know he's crazy)
I thought you know, nigga

I thought you muthafuckas knew

[ VERSE 2 ]
1-2, 1-2, every muthafucka hit the deck
Bushwick is back and I ain't what you expect
5th Ward, born to be a bonafide player
A order-disobeyer, neighborhood bitch-slayer
Settin shit straight, 9mm to the dome
Any nigga wanna feel this chrome, bring his ass on
And I'ma let him know what's happenin
If the nigga keeps on trippin I'ma keep on cappin
Dig it, till every muthafucka falls flat
Lyin in a crate on their muthafuckin back
Cause I'm collectin bodies like a muthafuckin morticianist
Bustin nuts in hoes, so you don't wanna get your bitch in this
Shoot em up, bang-bang, watch em hit the canvas
That's they way I plan this, niggas can't stand this
So make room for the 5th Ward devil
Yeah, see, I'm a rebel, doin shit on that other level
My mind is like a muthafuckin maze, gee
Phase after goddamn phase, but you can call me crazy

(Why you wanna fuck with Bushwick, you know he's crazy)
Ha! I thought you knew, nigga
(That nigga's crazy)
I thought you knew
(That nigga's crazy)

(Why you wanna fuck with Bushwick, you know he's crazy)
I thought you knew, nigga
(That nigga's crazy)
Ha! I thought you knew
(That nigga's crazy)
Aw shit

[ VERSE 3 ]
Line a bunch of muthafuckas up and watch em hit the deck
I'm puttin bitches and niggas in check, causin fuckin wreck
Bushwick Bill, I'm far from a rookie, ho
A maniac, rollin mark-ass niggas out like cookie dough
Hoes got blowed up, competition slowed up
Shit just ain't never been the same since I've showed up
I'm a loner, renegade loser
Filled with confusion, young nigga doin em
There ain't nobody safe when I'm on the streets
I'm the hardest muthafucka you can find on the 5 beat
Bustin caps in gust, bustin nuts and bust
Niggas gon' hit the dust fuckin around with us
Yeah, I'm leavin muthafuckas in a daze, gee
Call it what you want, nigga, yeah, but you can call me crazy

(Why you wanna fuck with Bushwick, you know he's crazy)
Ha! I thought you knew, nigga

(Bushwick Bill)
I see you punk motherfuckers tryin ta mix me
In a place where a mark ol bitch would be
So I guess I gotta let that fuckin thug out
Bug out I see you dead niggas drug out
I know you sayin damn I hate him
But gats ventilatin talkin niggas bodies like methalaytim
I caught a nigga like that when I was clubbin
Confronted him, then I dumped off in his chest
Motherfucker thought I was bluffin when I let it known
Nigga anything thats my business please leave it alone
And fools gonna hafta learn this bull shit the hard way
And I'll be stuck for life where the bard's stay
I give a fuck about your bitch ass
There'll be a lotta motherfuckas in this world wearin shit bags
Fuck talk, all I do is shoot nigga
I been pushed too motherfuckin far nigga

(CHORUS)
You fools done fucked around and ya tried to hard to test
Now I'm comin with some shit to crush they vest
Even a small soldier gotta point when he gotta snap
And blow you rotten motherfuckers off the map
You fools done fucked around and ya tried to hard to test
Now I'm comin with some shit to crush they vest
"So why in the fuck you wanna act up
Know when I can shoot your ass and your chest and blow your back up"

(Bushwick Bill)
Dollars and Sense is a motherfuckin playa crew
But God dammit playas have beef too
And its usually you jealous ass niggas
But sometimes even them ho's heads get bigger
And Mr. Chuck's too short to buy that
Shocked when I glocked that bitch, wear ya weave tied ho
Because the game done changed and its strange
How when a niggas dentures be te next niggas name to flip
When they see a playful nigga like me busta cap
Now Mr. Chuck gotta murder rap
And now that wanna stop me from breathin
But them better believe that me got somethin up my sleeve
Bully bye bye bye bye when I drive by
Die die when them motherfuckin bullets fly
I didn't ask for this shit but you brought it to me
You played pussy now get fucked, you push me

(CHORUS)

(Scarface)
Now I have no remorse
One slip of the tongue and now we makin arrangements for your corps
My body turns into the left field
Countin up the body count as I hear the caps peel
Now I wasn't known for eatin the flesh of the enemies
Stalkin you in packs so the killaz done with these
Rippin yo flesh now you're only seconds from yo death
Feel your heart poundin while your takin your last breath
I see you sayin you ain't scared to die
Then reality sets in gun shots rings and now ya start to cry
I guess you never knew how it would be
You messed up, now eternally you will rest in peace
You shoulda never played no games with me
You shoulda never sparked no flames with me
And now you understand your life is scarred
You played the deadly game and its a shame I hadta pull yo card

[Bushwick Bill]
I met this freaky thing, Juanita Madlock
She had a gat, big juicy fat cock
She thought that she was too much for me to deal with
Told her kick off her shoes, unpeel bitch
You can't deal with this dick from Bushwick
You said that, talk was cheap and her pussy was deep
It's not the size of the shit but the motion of the open
So there's nothin to be provin, bitch, get to movin
And rub my nuts, cause it's soothin
And don't be too rough, cause I'ma kick you in your stuff
She was goin strong, I had it goin on
With ease, I eased, her panties to her knees
Protectin myself, with the rubber-tussin
But the son of a bitch kept bustin
I was bumrushin, dick hard as trig
Man them lambskins don't come too big

[Chorus]
They don't come too big
I know, I know, they don't come too big - HA!
They don't come too big
I know, I know, they don't come too big - YES

[Bushwick Bill]
People hear my jams cause they slammin
And ask who in the fuck do I think I am?
It's Bushwick, to you Mr. B
Talk that he got his shit, now I'm put ya out your misery
Yeah that's right, step the fuck back
And don't be callin me no motherfuckin Bushwack
It's Bushwick, you dick-suckin tricks
I oughta kick your ass cause your brain don't click
Witcha wanna be cool-ass, fool-ass
Act like you never enrolled within a school class
Huffin and puffin, wanna fight, makin angry sounds
A nigga weighin two-hundred ninety-seven pounds
But I laughed, that's a small task
Told him run on up, nuttin said, nuttin asked
Cause I, never renegged on pullin the trig'
You ho motherfuckers don't come too big

[Chorus]

[Bushwick Bill]
Back to Juanita, the peter eater
This bitch swallowed my sperm by the 2-liter
She said that my dick tasted much sweeter yeah
Baby who knows her pose, bend over touch your toes
And close your mouth fore a minute
Before I end up stickin my dick in it
And you can't handle that, it's too massive
Girl I fuck around and block your wind passage
Bang bang, I was doin my thang
And the way I swang that bitch couldn't hang
I, made the bitch do, yoga
I, rocked the boat, tipped the boat over
Fired up a cig, grabbed the gin, took a swig
Stuck my dick in, and I dug, can you dig?
I was runnin through that ass like an 18-wheeler rig
I let them hoes know they don't come too big, check it

[Chorus] - 2X w/ ad libs

[ad libs to fade][B-Legit]
I flip, make hits, and stick like peanut butter
Five g's to the homie my money he didn't stutter
The gutter with the gats, fuck that, we need the lucho
It ain't no in between such things as being neutral
We shoot y'all, answering to me if it's needed
Catch you in the bucket and fuck it we gon feed it
We bleed it, A-K spray and nine milla
You fuckin with a killa for scrilla
Money wanna deala
Peel 'em from the back and fact, you're ass out
Throw you in the trunk, we bump and mash out
We blast out and get the fuck outta dodge
And leave your body corpse parked at the Travellodge
You can't reason with a fool with guns and no brains
Thrown off your balcony get stoned and let's remain
We stressed main, paper come up short
Plus this bitch with my baby tryin to take me to court
I need a new quarter, plus my screws is loose
Makin niggas wanna pour shit down like orange juice
I one two, and slap the fuck outta you
So go on about my business bitch, and do what you do
You like to run shit
Do what you do
You fuck with powder bitch?
Hey yo, do what you do
You turn dyke too
Yeah, do what you do
But if it's fuck me bitch, then it's fuck you too
If you build a heist
Yo, do what you do
You like to talk the vice?
Do what you do
Speakin on my crew
Nigga, do what you do
But if it's fuck me bitch, then it's fuck you too

Me and two freaks in B-Legit's back seat
F-u-c-k-i-n-g
I got clunkers, cuz you know big Chuck like em plump
Sippin hurricane bumpin slurricane cuz it thumps
In my trunk my pistol grip pump at all times
Kryptonite got me blowed cuz I hit it five times
I got condom on my dick, but my mind is on scrilla
Bitches just respect this nigga Chuck and I'ma killa
Me and my nigga, four hoes, weed, and liquor
Headed to the boat to freak these bitches on the river
And since I'm from the south these hoes showin me love
And B is from the west, he really don't give a fuck
Twenty minutes later, all hell broke loose
Bitches suckin dick and lickin up nut juice
One bitch said she like to eat pussy too
She looked at me, I said shit, bitch, do what you do
Bitch you like suckin dick?
Do what you do
Homie, you like to eat pussy?
Do what you do
Nigga you like bein broke?
Do what you do
Bitch you wanna fuck me, I wanna fuck you too
Nigga you like stealin cars?
Do what you do
Nigga you like bein 'hind bars?
Do what you do
Nigga you don't give a fuck about shit?
Do what you do
Nigga it's fuck Bushwick, well fuck you tooArtist: The Terrorists f/ Bushwick Bill

[Dope-E]
Yeah, getting ready to slash to media...
You see, what you need to do is start jocking the right information...

Fuck the media coming straight from The Terrorists crew
I don't love none of ya'll hoes so fuck you
You never understand the things I write
Until you spend a night in the South Park twilight
I'm steadily trying to reach my black folks
But all you wanna see is a nigga with black locs
And you be knowing what the fuck we be saying
And you know damn well we ain't playing
Now, as simple as that, stop spreading lies
Before I place M-60 right between your eyes (Yaips!)
Cause now ya'll got me mad as hell
And all you jealous pens' writing tattle tales
But I don't give a fuck about your ass
See, ya'll just mad a nigga rolling in cold cash
I'm down with Rap-A-Lot, now I got a lot
And I'll be damned to let you fuck over what I got
I kick that knowledge on a roughest tip
Call Egypt soft, you be bloody with a busted lip
All because I rap with a slang and hang...
With the South Park Coaliton game
Together forever, hard niggas real tight
Everybody strapped with them 9's and we will fight
Crashing bodies and throwin'em in the trash
Grab their pens and pads and shove it up their ass
Fuck the media...

[Bushwick Bill]
Fuck them mothafuckas, Dope-E...
(Fuck them mothafuckas, Dope-E, cause I don't love'em...)
Me and Dope-E are the world's first fully functional homicide agency...
(Them mothafuckas come on TV fucking with you, man...)
You don't really wanna fuck with me...
(Nothing but lies fucking us...)
Wait till they get a load of us...
(Wait till they get a load of me...)

[Dope-E]
You ask why I rap about violence and not peace
Ho, get out my face before I burn you with some hot grease
Yeah, Dope-E know the game cause I'm down
See, everything I tell you now later it'll be changed around
Now, why you wanna start some static...
With The Terrorists knowing damn well we cause tragic
Fatal disastors, you betta run and hide
Cause I play Quincy and inject you with some syanide
Catch somebody else, one by one, that oughta get'em
If not I'm forced to use another form of terrorism
Either I'm violent or silent, bodies still drop
Johnny lost steps up, no sweat, Nip kills cops
See, what you failed to understand I'm a black poet
A brainchild of this society so blow it out your asshole
Cause I write what I see...
In the streets of Houston and on the screens of the TV
And that's the way it is and that's the way it gonna be
And keep your distance and your hands off me
When I'm in concert give me some clearance
Remember, fatal mishaps happen when there interference
Fuck the media...

[Bushwick Bill]
I likes the way it sounds...Hah hah haaa...
(Fuck them mothafuckas...)
But yo, dig this, man...
(God damn them sons of bitches...)
Them mothafuckas ain't never been where we been...
(Do they know who they fucking with?)
They never seen what we have seen...
(Don't they know I'm their worst nightmare?)
Yeah, I tried to kill myself and got shot in a eye...
(I'm a type of mothafucka you think you see but I'm not really there...)
And then the media wanna ask me why?
(But all my thoughts are clear...)
What if I would put you under the same pressures you put me under?
(I live off fear...)
How would you like the microscope to be on your ass?
(All I wanna do is suck his blood dry and smoke some fry...)
Don't you know that the ghetto's nothing but a modern day Vietnam?
(And your mama wanna ask why? Hah hah haaaa...)
And my backyard is a concentration camp...
(Man, fuck them, man...)
And you wonder why I smoke amp...
(You like to report shit?)
Because you mothafuckas put it in my neighborhood
Cause you always up to no good...
(Report to get my mothafucking fist out of your mother's forehead...)
But fuck you...Fuck the goverment...Fuck everything you stand for..
(Cause I know half of my body is Chuckie
And the other half is Bushwick...)
Cause you say that way...All the same, all created equal...
(And fucking over media ain't nothing but child's play...)
Only thing that's equal is a fact
That you're white and know how to add up...Hah haa...
(Fuck media with that Tell-Lie-Vision...)
And some drag to my black ass from what's rightfully mines...
(I already know you telling lies to my vision...)
It's ok...It all don't have to make sense...
(And Dope-E is ready to light some true facts...)
See, cause I already know that I'm not all together there...
(And you are just straight up full of shit...)
But your psychiatrist put me there...
(Weather reporters...)
But fuck'em...Fuck them all...
(We be out there on the streets...We are in the middle of a war zone...)
All I need is more knowledge, more wisdom and more understanding...
(Ya'll sit back behind your desk...)
So I can see even clearer...
(And send some other sucker to tell you some shit that ain't even true...)
And fuck over your bitch ass...
(But if you keep fucking with me you gonna know what is what...)
Yai-yai-yaiks on your bitch ass!
