Man this world we live in
There's two to ways do everything
The right way and the wrong way
Thens there's the short way and the long way
But I'mma do my thing the DARK MASK WAY
I'm either gonna make it or I'mma take it

[Chorus: Smoothe Da Hustler]
I got to make something or I got to take something
Even if it comes down to hustling in public
I'mma do whatever to avoid the stormy weather
Got my act together either make or take

[Verse 1: Nine]
In the land of the free and the home of the brave
I still feel like a slave, my heart is dark like the bat cave
Don't cry, dry your eye
We all gon' die, but I'm gon' die fly
In the race the great paper chase
Money's the only thing that I'mma let you throw in my face
Corrupt political officials, speak the issues
And diss you, like used toilet tissue, I'mma miss you
When you fall into the flames it's the same games
With new names, and new gains
Same pains, and blood stains propaganda
I want to smoke trees in a Havana, wearing a bandanna
At the Copacabana, swear to God I split a nigga like a banana
Over currencies or property ain't no stoppin' me
I'm building a monopoly now copy me
Each one teach one lessons of making and taking
Erasing, faking, and snaking, serious like a Jamaican
And I bring home the bacon daily, really
I never fake it, I got to make it, like it's sacred
Fuck around and I'mma take it

[Chorus: Smoothe Da Hustler] (x2)

[Verse 2: Nine]
My hand raps around dollar bills sends chills
Down my spine like cheap wine, so I gotta get mine
All the time I rewind back to the day
When I realized sometimes crime
Pays, there's six million ways to die but only one to live
I need enough money to spend enough money to give
Cause I love my peeps and my peeps love me
And I refuse to see them living in poverty
I gotta be on point, I anoint myself savior with new flavor
Like Craig with my third eye I cried
Shed tears in the mind for being blind
Only thing left for me now is crime or rhyme

[Chorus: Smoothe Da Hustler] (x2)

[Verse 3: Nine]
I refuse to lose similar to Chuck
Never bite the hand that feed you never bite the hand that buck
Now what! stuck in a maze with only one way out
Figure it out that's what life's about
Trail after trail, tribulation after tribulation
I want a black nation cause I'm sick of the plantation
No more picking cotton have you forgotten
We the kings and queens of this earth
Now Rome in the rotten apple
Drinking Snapple, trying to get a little capital
Spend it like I'm crazy that's what rap will do
You got to maintain make sense out of what's insane
And stay on top of your game
Don't blame nobody but yourself for your lack of wealth
Times get hard get sneaky like a stealth
Make or take is the thesis
I want pieces of the pie gotta do or die

[Chorus: Smoothe Da Hustler] (x2)[Sean Strange][Intro: Smoothe Da Hustler]

Nobody understand

[Hook]

I'm only human
I'm only human (My everyday lifestyle)
I'm only human (As a struggle)
I'm only human
I'm only human (As a life thing)
I'm only human
I'm only human (See, everything is misunderstood)
I'm only human.(less ?)


[Verse 1: Smoothe Da Hustler]

Peep the steelo if you don't know me
Slowly, you'll begin a holy accountable for criminal acts when i hustle
Brothers be on a cops snitching stuff get the tussle
I'm strictly on a Glock spittin' stuff
And for new jacks
Talkin' about bustin' cats in their new raps
What's perhaps convinced by smooth?
True that, true that
I dismiss fools like Mr. Menace
I make the Illmatic with baking soda
Been ringin' bell never seen with ?
The struggle
The keep the family from warning
The fast money
The keep man, my people's floatin'
Sign the deal, get it to jail clothes
Me no selling none of ya ? hotel melt rows
The rap is my place, i sell o's
My everyday routine counting green
Rock will be the sin, ruckus be the team
From public school got the feedback
I stay cool like G Rap
?scorning? fools, no tunes snatch ya b-pack


[Hook]


[Verse 2: Smoothe Da Hustler]

My little hustle turned into big ones
Little money turned into big funs
? turned into big guns
My avenue stay clouded with playas and hustlas from '82
To 88 plus my lady crew
Drop me kid
Used to dress sloppy kid
Car from ? east new york, now they clap me kid
Versace kid
Copy the gear when they watch me kid
Hook with the yard now i'm ? the winner like Rocky kid
Push stressed side cause money may be violent
Mom sayin' i'm blessed with a talent
And i should thank God but i don't want my mother thinkin' i'm a punk
So when she go to sleep i get up my bed and pray silent
My mother way is good so i copy her
Me and my clique is so tight we kiss chicks just like the Mafia
I'm over top of ya
And in the industry
When they mention me
I mention ruckus cause i'm real


[Hook]


[Verse 3: Smoothe Da Hustler]

Once in a while i do the Mac-up
For those to act up
I back-up
Cause '96 i'm running rap maps
And for jealous fellas there's no help form
The only reason i made medicicine square
For steppin' trough my garden cause i felt form
The reason how i give it
Even if my everyday lifestyle ain't nothing but a hustle why i'mma live it?
I drop jewels and stop crews from steppin' up
You got beef, then throw your weapon up
I ease and squeeze at ya mellin
No time for yellin' for sellin'
I became a second time fellin'
The street like ? and custom to make me see my mistakes
No more bells, no more jails
And takes a lot to admit your wrong doing
Representin' thus what i'm on doing
Speaking the truth's what my song's doing
The ill reason, the real reason
The ready aim cocked is still reason

[Hook][Trigger Tha Gambler]
There a toker, under the numb, scumb looker
Get the gatherin, big willy, me, thug rich and booker
The gun to gun, face off, street smart nigga
That I'm ready to tear your numbers right off the burners
To throw the D-8 trace off, ruckus click cause the mystery
Sellin, which, cap killin, go down in history
You dissin me, bell to releact the combat
I sit back, when niggas throw raps
I be like, "where your are at"

[Rubbabandz]
It's a leaky-leak world and I don't give a fuck
All I wanna do is puff that purple stuff
The sun ain't never shine on my block
It's like a permanent eclipse
The only light is gun spark
Fightin on the premissis, that you want to be yours
Catch your on the stairs, your floor's eight
But, you won't make it past four
I'm sick and tired of niggas actin high fashional
Flashin, wackin and not reactin

[Smoothe Da Hustler]
Yall niggas, know what time it is
Leavin niggas withour no watches
When I drop this shit about hustlin
Yall niggas know, who rhyme it is
You gettin the head from bathroom
To book-book to rap-rap to tracks-tracks to wax-wax
When starts toss the headphone
The dead zone, MC's get done since
The grittiest square root
Equals a dead mother fucker in my circumference
The shell maxed, well matched, dressed in black leather
To come through buildin for buildin
Jack dead for crime cheddar

[Shyheim]
All day, I dream about guns, money, cars and bitches
Thirsty niggas, who want my riches
I got somethin for em, in '96, you gotta be trife or die
That's how it is in the streets of S.I., in god we trust the lye
Niggas I run with, their mentality is fuck it
And heated with a vest, gun cocked ready to buck shit
Altough they do, to makin crack and dope sales
And jiggy-jigg won't stop us from gettin the dough, for real

Twenty bodies rapped, twenty churches rung death bells

Girl come here, bitch slapped and carjackin
Cap carrier, contract arrangin, twenty-thousand dollar hit
Body, the scenic

[Shyheim]
Bet your life nigga on two red and one green dice
For fifty cents, nickels or get nice and pay the price
A hot rolex with ice, fit around my wrist
A gorilla in the mist, with a four fifth, kill you and your bitch
Get you open like bullet wounds, deadly like toxic fumes
Get my peoples ??? through all the ballons
Wack rappers and listeners, this for all yall
Can't follow, put my records out on virgin
Cause my styles be sellin

[Smoothe Da Hustler]
Brooklyn and Shaolin puttin the hurtin in front of the curtain
Hookin and crookin, I'm takin back uptown, back downtown like fulton
I house the best, when I be rappin, I be packin
So niggas in clubs, fire marshalls got me on house arrest
Front, I caution it, I bless so many mics
After I die, niggas'll cut my hand off and auction it
Nineteen seventy-seven, february eighth
This little nigga be packin big, but I ain't got faith to hustle it

[Ice-T]
You know Smooth man, no matter..
No matter how much I love a bitch, man
I could be with a bitch and I really want to marry her, man

[Smooth] Uhha.. what?!

[Ice-T]
And it's something that goes on in my head I can't explain it

[Chorus: Ice-T X2]
Once I bust a nut I'm out
All the real niggas know what I'm talking about
We might take you out to dinner buy you shit, it's crazy
But once I bust a nut I'm Swazy

[Verse One: Smoothe Da Hustler]
I'm on a one O'clock booty call; this girl is a freak
Lights out, drop those drawers, pull back those sheets
But hold up, stand up and throw your head to your feet
And you can bite up on the pillow if I'm in too deep
Bad shots, always sad, I never cuddle in bed
I only cuddle your neck while you're giving me head
And that's all, and I told you, we can fly and the ball
But I'm wrong, we can do it up and buy out the mall
But I'm gone, I'm on the next bus, next club
Next slut, next fuck, fucking the next one, next up
Legs up, how many girls I done hit up and ran?
I'm like smooth I'm already trying to fuck your friends
Then I'm...

[Chorus: Ice-T X2]

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
Sometimes my dick gets hard as a pole
Fucked so many bitches, think my dick went gold
I love the stripping bitches, dancing bitches, fat butt whores
I love the high heeled bitches with them sexy toes
If you're really hot, I might buy you some clothes
Fat enough ass, you'll get to ride on my rolls
Good enough head, might get you some gold
But once I bust off; Daddy is back on the road
Cause once I hit the drawers, I start noticing flaws
Didn't realize your gut was that big or that wig
I'm back in the same club I met you slut
Bitches just demanding me, hard dick insanity
I really loved you up until I fucked you
Uhh.. once I skied, it's kinda like a track meet
How fast can I get some fresh pussy on my dick?
A different type whore, a different color bitch

[Chorus: Ice-T X2]

[Verse Three: Deuce Fever]
I got go to put my pants on
She said where are you going handsome?
Trying to hold a nigga for ransom
After all the shit I bought and then some
Smiling with her mouth full of cum, another one dumb dumb
Got to go, got another whore, waiting for me in the lobby, yo
And plus, she got body too
She is beautiful, toes done to the cuticle
Hold up Ma, you know, what I'll do to you? "BITCH!!"
Chew you out, beat it up, put it your butt
Blindfold you, hand cuffed, then mind mold you
It's all gravy, baby, When I roll through
Bag your whole crew, we can Menage-a-trois it up
While your girl licking my butt
Rubbing my gut, playing with my nuts
Love your shape, wanna squeeze and hold you
Bitch, what I told you?

[Chorus: Ice-T X2]

[Verse Four: Trigger Tha Gambler]
I got this thing for titties and long hair, bitches with curves
But I kick them to the curbs, if they get on my nerves
I swerve to the right, hit the lock, hit the block
Think I'm feeling that hard, to stop playing?
Cause I.. beg them, bag them, beat them in the head
Later, they beat me and beg to meet me in the bed
Damn!! I'm such a good talker
I'm like fuck her cause I could fuck her
But then I threw her dick suck offer
Now homegirl flipping, in her own world tripping
She falls for anything, old girls slipping
I told her roll with her homegirl, both girls dipping
Now me, her and her homegirls switching
So homegirls listen

[Chorus: Ice-T X2][Chorus: Marc Live - repeat 2X]
Where's your hustle?  Where you from?
What's your street rep?  What have you done?
I don't know you yet, you're not a legend
Fuck your block, you a regular nigga

[Marc Live]
Yo... this is my brand new debut
Welcome to my, twisted life, you'll risk your life
I grew up where the streets are dark
And - kids sell and go to hell in one night
And chicks snitch so quick, yo in milliseconds
The villains home invade, comin to get'cha
My whole level is, gutterest
Dead to rights, no strings attached
Uhh, but not the fun and games
Niggas is backwards, I rip their backs off
Yeah, your team is not thorough
Studio kingpin, I'm pullin your ink pen
Stop writin (stop writin...)
And if you write in your head, stop thinkin
Stop talkin (uhh...)
You Sean Penn nigga, "Dead Man Walking"

[Chorus]

[Smoothe Da Hustler]
Nigga we shut shit down like the marshalls
Padlock and chain, dead cock, padlock your brain
Cats with keys/ki's get chased out the street
BAM!  Ran over by my man Landrover Jeep
I creep, stand over with heat
The plan, ran closer to handover your plan folder to me
So respect it, I'm deeply connected
I'm a survivor, three feet under the street wreckage
I side spectate, Cartier square look
Then Columbine everybody in the yearbook
Cats tellin me they next to acquire
But I respected, reconnected the wire, stupid step in the fire
I'ma do you fouler than Amadou
Roll past you slow gas you drop heat, and watch the fire follow you
Who sellin you dreams of cottonest sheet
Nigga I catch you in your nightmare and rock you to sleep, nigga

[Chorus]

[Marc Live]
Yo, you do regular things, you hug the block
Every weekend you hug the Glock - sucka
You're too scared to, make it happen
I know killers that'll you make you happen - uhh
Look, you won't get it from rappin
This is real life, real shit - yeah
Real Desert Eagle, real people
C'mon yo there's just no sequel
Look, you a full time groupie
I'm soldier nigga, gone off looseleaf
Four star general
You know me, respect me, so salute me
Niggas I blow the game up
Stop playin kid, I'll blow your frame up
And yo, you lame as fuck
I'm veteran, real nigga, get your game up

If I got a vibe that it's going down, I'm gon' set it
And I bet it, to the day I die my tec could wet it
The war is on, lace up, for the Saratoga armageddon, psycho like Bates
Ill like sickle cell traits
My game is long, money, half-a-mil for my ten estates
The meat cleaver, morgue chopper, the click bender
Back up on the eighth, cop on the sing, highway to heaven sender
(Smoothe)
The competitor, street editor, be ready or
Be buried a-live, get flipped like my cellular on the regular
Heavy packin', burner steady clappin'
The turn a petty rapper spaghetti, pasta
Hasta la vista, meet the sweeper
(Trigga)
Glad to meet 'cha, bodybag to greet 'cha
Pimpin' this track like a preacher, I teach ya
All a lesson and my blessin's
First name Tawan, Last name Smith without the Wesson
Ain't no question, we ain't askin', only blastin'
Front page flash and the action without the Jackson
(Smoothe & Trigga)
And bitin' it'll make you choke, you can't provoke
You can't cope, language is broke, because we ain't no joke[Verse One: Trigger tha Gambler]
I got the mad act, that your bad act is like that-at
I'm the broken language avenge on your trad-acks
Take two of these or wad-ax, that's a fad-act
You're running hotter, I slip up, bother to slaughter
Cree-deep, catch you off guard when you slee-deep
Throw the gun to your neck, so [barb?] with me
Blaow: one to your artery
I be the big bad wolf
Niggas, like styles, get took
I'm the reinforcer
Crushin' god, double-crosser
Bodyguard, Kevin Costner night stalker
Indictments say outta our eyewitness got snitches
They point fingers at thug niggas and bitches
Even at my dealing sign, keep the seal tucked
So you can't [???]
Trigger: I make raw deals with gravediggers
Behave nigga. Or be sportin' permanent shades nigga

[Hook: D.V. Alias Khrist]
Bust, with your guns
Up and bust, come on now
Bust, with your guns
Up and bust, come on now
Bust, a little bit louder now
Bust, a little bit louder now
Bust, with your guns
Up and bust, come on now

[Verse Two: D.V. Alias Khrist]
Roll with a hustler and so [???]
Smooth operators on some Don Perignon shit
Smackin' your bitch
Cause you don't know how to treat her
Since I'm a pimp preacher, I'll teach her
How to bring back wraps of cash
It's an easy operation
Touch one of my girls, you're in a bad situation
My occupation makes that real dope, real dope
Got the fiends fiending off the product that we built up
Box it up in a little bag up the ass
Got the cash stashed
Got the Glocks cocked just in case I gotta BLAST
With anyone who tries to front right about now
Shippin' drugs out of state to [Cal-Sal?]
My profile is simple jigness
Women beg for forgiveness when they see the pimp and his pimptress
You don't believe me, ask Smoothe, he's my witness
BEEOTCH!

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Smoothe da Hustler]
I'm the head honcho, the slugger
The Brownsville mugger
Undercover to uncover the FBI brother
Fuck the maybe
I'm rather unique like A.Z
When niggas thing of Saratoga they say me, lately
I've been on some down-low shit
Niggas are scheisty
Politely invite me out to the back to snipe me
That's why I keep the gat by my side
So what up? I cause track slides, rap collides
I throwdown in any showdown my lowdown
I slow down niggas for more ground
My four-pound has the crown
Hold up
I know ya'll niggas ain't thinkin' about steppin' up to us
After you heard this shit here? Nah, not this year
Me and my clique beside me
Went through six hundred and sixty six Giulianis
Illuminatis probably
A New World Order to slaughter
I'm running across the whole quarter
Me and my clique drop degrees like cold water[Verse 1: Diabolic]
I step in the place with an empty stomach, I’m starving
I run in someone’s apartment with a gun as a marksman
When the Suffolk department runs up with a warrant
Fuck the judge, I’m departing with the governor’s pardon
Getting drunk with my squadron of prehistoric beasts
If I even claw your cheek I’mma leave with all your teeth
Fuck your prerecorded speech, I believe that talk is cheap
When people caught your beef you just flee and call police
While my composure’s kept closer than my foes could get
Last time I broke a sweat your ho was soaking wet
You chose to pose a threat and hoped I overslept
Don’t hold your breath homie you’ll probably choke to death
You know the rep, now go check your method and see
The truth getting buried then resurrected as me
Diabolic, I’m the message setting you free
Like the Grand Dragon hanging by his neck from a tree

[Verse 2: Smoothe Da Hustler]
I hang with the illest, gangbang with the realest
I ain’t staying the skill is, my aim is to kill us
I stay chasing them figures, I came banging them triggers
I’m in your cage to pillage, a bunch of angry gorillas
Check niggas, deaf niggas, secs to listen saying they feel us
Wanna hang with the fearless, yeah they can hang from the ceiling
My name stay in the business, I maintain an appearance
I can’t change in the mirror, y’all can’t paint in the picture
I keep a shank in ya giblets, my naysayers are finished
I lane change in a minute, my lane can’t be driven in
I break day for the digits, I traded ‘caine with dealers
I traded .38s for pay, traded greys with killers
I say stay with your vision, my slang made an incision
Some say I changed but the deal is, I just changed where I’m living
So when I say it I did it you fake it I live it you play it I spit it
You stay and I visit ya lady to get it, now let’s hit it

[Verse 3: Kool G Rap]
Doing niggas like vandalism, about to catch an aneurism, from my hammer’s rhythm
Nigga damn who isn’t, while I just copped a brand new prism
No money bitch but I grant you jism
Street smarts buck sparks if I see marks on the grams you give em
Real nigga bitch will glance you with him
Long story to short, I’m like fuck if I die poor in New York
When OG with OZs with 40 to snort
From things I lust, blinged up, like King Tut bang all the sluts
Blow no chips, pay off hookers and strangle ya bucks
Niggas spaz .44 Mag to mangle his guts
Only going to jail chained up ankle and up
Face mask on like Hannibal Lecter
My part of Queens the animal scepter
You can’t handle the pressure, keep standing there, hand on ya pecker
End up a tagged foot in forensic van bein' inspected nigga

[Verse 4: Graph]
I run with a strong army of gunmen, a cross on me
So if death was coming may God warn me
I keep sess coming, I’m puffing like Bob Marley
I get your head busted bloody y’all laundry
My money’s all bloody y'all, I’ll put money on, the front of y’all
Skull if y’all saw me, get to running up off me
I work hard, I ain’t comfy under some palm tree
But I’m Hummer stunting jumping out of somethin' costly
Fuck the law please, they ain’t plucking the gun up off me
The handle’s hot, I feel like I’m tucking a cup of coffee
Pack mad heater, feel like I’m rubbing the sun across me
A black hand piece that I’m cupping is something frosty
I got bitches on my nuts, some are horny
Exhibit A, I can’t get your mother off me
I’m diabolic, I’m dying watching some ? busting off ?
Fire rockets the size of the projects bang bangThe question is why the answer what makes
If u wants my opinion I tell you don't take x 2

Why...

(Smoothe Da Hustler)
Why is it hard for my words to get heard
The uncut give it to niggas raw gets absorb
Why is it that every black brother talks the slang
Why is it that slang determines if a brother hangs
Why is it that people judge niggas by how they look
Why is it that hoodies on my head makes me a crook
Why is it that people got to struggle to survive
Why is it that nine to five is harder to get in ninety-five
I wonder why that those that heard of me started making records all of a
Sudden want to murder me
Why is it that niggas talk the talk but never walk the walk so I talk the
Talk if niggas scared to walk New York
Why is it that those who chose to live the street life greet life with a
Slug to his mug and scared to greet life
I wonder why it is harder for my family why it is the man in me that keeps
Me thinking that no bodys understanding me

Chorus x 4

(Smoothe Da Hustler)
What makes a man a strong man
What makes a woman a strong woman
Don't confuse wrongg one
Cause intellectual keeps it exceptional for both
It is just my professional side that keeps me wondering without a loaf
What makes it possible for me to kick to you
Predict to you for future reference
For you to take heed but that's your preference
What makes two hundred and fifty seven degrees from one hundred eighty seven
Five o's tapes Lp's and Cd's
What makes one hundred percent one hundred and ten percent to be quit foul
I am built like five percent is on my lifestlye
What makes my click my click
What makes my chick my chick
What makes my vic my vic
What makes my dick taste an slick
I wonder..
What makes a hustler crew is it what I slang to u
Or what I bring to you
Behind closed doors
Or what I bring to you from of the mind record
What makes me slow is this
What makes me grow is this
What makes me know and blow is this

Chorus x 4
(Smoothe Da Hustler)
Now that everything is of the chest
There is a couple of matters I must attend to before I rest
Don't take my family
Don't take my people
Don't take next level cause to me there's no equal
Don't take my click
Don't take the hoodies or the hats
Don't take the burners and th gats
Don't take the BMW's and the MPV's
Don't take the keys
Don't take the g's
Don't take the gooses
Don't take the grim's
Don't take the kaki jeans or the tims
Don't take the studio
Don't take the tracks
Don't take the spots
Don't take the cracks
Don't take the weed that I smoke
Don't take the name smoothe wrong or this jam for a joke
Don't take the players and the hustlers getting cash
Don't take the projects
Don't take the ave
Don't take the females that I talk to
Don't take the Glock that I cock on the blocks that I walk through
Don't take my daughter
Don't take my son
Don't take my pride
Ever died by the gun hold this

Stiff dick touches clits like Brownsville lips to dutches

Fuck rappin and livin, fuck who you down wit
Who you know, or did a song wit

Smoothe Da Hustla, Saratoga Ave. representin'[Intro: Nine]
Man this world we live in
There's two to ways do everything
The right way and the wrong way
Thens there's the short way and the long way
But I'mma do my thing the DARK MASK WAY
I'm either gonna make it or I'mma take it

[Chorus: Smoothe Da Hustler]
I got to make something or I got to take something
Even if it comes down to hustling in public
I'mma do whatever to avoid the stormy weather
Got my act together either make or take

[Verse 1: Nine]
In the land of the free and the home of the brave
I still feel like a slave, my heart is dark like the bat cave
Don't cry, dry your eye
We all gon' die, but I'm gon' die fly
In the race the great paper chase
Money's the only thing that I'mma let you throw in my face
Corrupt political officials, speak the issues
And diss you, like used toilet tissue, I'mma miss you
When you fall into the flames it's the same games
With new names, and new gains
Same pains, and blood stains propaganda
I want to smoke trees in a Havana, wearing a bandanna
At the Copacabana, swear to God I split a nigga like a banana
Over currencies or property ain't no stoppin' me
I'm building a monopoly now copy me
Each one teach one lessons of making and taking
Erasing, faking, and snaking, serious like a Jamaican
And I bring home the bacon daily, really
I never fake it, I got to make it, like it's sacred
Fuck around and I'mma take it

[Chorus: Smoothe Da Hustler] (x2)

[Verse 2: Nine]
My hand raps around dollar bills sends chills
Down my spine like cheap wine, so I gotta get mine
All the time I rewind back to the day
When I realized sometimes crime
Pays, there's six million ways to die but only one to live
I need enough money to spend enough money to give
Cause I love my peeps and my peeps love me
And I refuse to see them living in poverty
I gotta be on point, I anoint myself savior with new flavor
Like Craig with my third eye I cried
Shed tears in the mind for being blind
Only thing left for me now is crime or rhyme

[Chorus: Smoothe Da Hustler] (x2)

[Verse 3: Nine]
I refuse to lose similar to Chuck
Never bite the hand that feed you never bite the hand that buck
Now what! stuck in a maze with only one way out
Figure it out that's what life's about
Trail after trail, tribulation after tribulation
I want a black nation cause I'm sick of the plantation
No more picking cotton have you forgotten
We the kings and queens of this earth
Now Rome in the rotten apple
Drinking Snapple, trying to get a little capital
Spend it like I'm crazy that's what rap will do
You got to maintain make sense out of what's insane
And stay on top of your game
Don't blame nobody but yourself for your lack of wealth
Times get hard get sneaky like a stealth
Make or take is the thesis
I want pieces of the pie gotta do or die

[Chorus: Smoothe Da Hustler] (x2)[Intro: Smoothe Da Hustler]

Nobody understand

[Hook]

I'm only human
I'm only human (My everyday lifestyle)
I'm only human (As a struggle)
I'm only human
I'm only human (As a life thing)
I'm only human
I'm only human (See, everything is misunderstood)
I'm only human.(less ?)


[Verse 1: Smoothe Da Hustler]

Peep the steelo if you don't know me
Slowly, you'll begin a holy accountable for criminal acts when i hustle
Brothers be on a cops snitching stuff get the tussle
I'm strictly on a Glock spittin' stuff
And for new jacks
Talkin' about bustin' cats in their new raps
What's perhaps convinced by smooth?
True that, true that
I dismiss fools like Mr. Menace
I make the Illmatic with baking soda
Been ringin' bell never seen with ?
The struggle
The keep the family from warning
The fast money
The keep man, my people's floatin'
Sign the deal, get it to jail clothes
Me no selling none of ya ? hotel melt rows
The rap is my place, i sell o's
My everyday routine counting green
Rock will be the sin, ruckus be the team
From public school got the feedback
I stay cool like G Rap
?scorning? fools, no tunes snatch ya b-pack


[Hook]


[Verse 2: Smoothe Da Hustler]

My little hustle turned into big ones
Little money turned into big funs
? turned into big guns
My avenue stay clouded with playas and hustlas from '82
To 88 plus my lady crew
Drop me kid
Used to dress sloppy kid
Car from ? east new york, now they clap me kid
Versace kid
Copy the gear when they watch me kid
Hook with the yard now i'm ? the winner like Rocky kid
Push stressed side cause money may be violent
Mom sayin' i'm blessed with a talent
And i should thank God but i don't want my mother thinkin' i'm a punk
So when she go to sleep i get up my bed and pray silent
My mother way is good so i copy her
Me and my clique is so tight we kiss chicks just like the Mafia
I'm over top of ya
And in the industry
When they mention me
I mention ruckus cause i'm real


[Hook]


[Verse 3: Smoothe Da Hustler]

Once in a while i do the Mac-up
For those to act up
I back-up
Cause '96 i'm running rap maps
And for jealous fellas there's no help form
The only reason i made medicicine square
For steppin' trough my garden cause i felt form
The reason how i give it
Even if my everyday lifestyle ain't nothing but a hustle why i'mma live it?
I drop jewels and stop crews from steppin' up
You got beef, then throw your weapon up
I ease and squeeze at ya mellin
No time for yellin' for sellin'
I became a second time fellin'
The street like ? and custom to make me see my mistakes
No more bells, no more jails
And takes a lot to admit your wrong doing
Representin' thus what i'm on doing
Speaking the truth's what my song's doing
The ill reason, the real reason
The ready aim cocked is still reason

We like to welcome you all to club hater
Where hustlers, bitches, and thugs they all hate ya
When players floss, they false and toss paper
Where your people are fake, and they might snake ya
We like to welcome you all to club hater
But we ain’t sweating it, our moves are major
Let’s get this party poppin’, let’s get them titties shaking
Make sure the shit we sayin’ keep the city hatin’

[Verse One: Diabolic]
Yeah, yeah, club hater, where thugs hate ya if you touch paper
Where y’all are bound to get stuck like we duct taped ya
Where cats who tuck razors are much safer
While I recline and find a dime to fuck later
Models clock watching the bottles you got poppin’
You not knockin’ to hustle bitch so stop plottin’
Start knob slobbing and get me off like John Cochran
‘Til some hater gets his jaw rawked for cock blockin’
It’s not stoppin’, sip 80 proof Grey Goose
‘Till I fall out like a baby tooth came loose
It may be true, we’ll take loops from crooks who kill ya
Real recognize real and you don’t look familiar
Takin’ shots of liquor, some vodka mixture
Late night, when snakes bite, and plot to hit ya
You got the picture, in the cut smoking a L
Ladies free all night, doors open at 12

[Chorus]
[Verse Two: Smoothe Da Hustler]
You’re the shit if you’re there, dipped in the ware, it’s tension here
Sniff the air, smell a stench in the gear
Bitch in your ear, her fist in your rear
Adjusting your vision to witness a slip in your gear and disappear
We bury men, hitting more licks than lesbians
Sleep, we give you more nightmares than Freddy
The shiest talkers, life talkers who strike offers
After the club, we home, run hoes, we night hawkers
We ice flossers, and dice tossers, we like corners
We club hop with drug blocks they ride for us
What you buggin’ for coming in the door, front and huggin’ the wall
Beefin’, why you think I carry the oven for?
Reaching to half bake one of y’all, some of y’all want it raw
You carry the battle, I’m tuggin’ the war
Come aboard, I’m comfy, try not bugging me
Guy’s died ugly for eye fucking me, he was cockeye ?

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Smoothe Da Hustler]
Look there ain’t no dress code, expect hoes to be dressed in less clothes
Hate growing like escrow
Heck no, you can’t get my John Hancock
I’m in the john, hand on my cock in a fan’s twat
Hustler’s creep, scheming on something to eat
‘Cause a customer leave with some hustler up the street
The flame from the snub laid him dead under the sheets
So the name of the club changes every couple of weeks

[Diabolic]
Trouble and beef, will scuffle ’til my knuckles are beat
I won’t stop ’til I knock out a bunch of your teeth
Surrounded by cut-throats, drowned in the Dutch smoke
Burning haze ’til every clown in the club choke
The top recruit, in hot pursuit if you’ve got the loot
With some prostitute in the bathroom knockin’ boots
Ready for war, cock and shoot, the same soldiers
Diabolic and Smoothe Da Hustler, the game’s over

The axe on the necks, left for trach
We heard your footsteps in the city where the sun don't shine
Reign affliction last forever when it's the race upon the 9
Ruckus, so plan your mind and organise

I sit back in my bed watch Bill and Ted
Make sure my days is Excellent before my eyes get red
The professor teachin rappers without the lecture
My texture move forty yards like rave tracks without the measure (measure)
My crew come better, better come with crews that's beef setters
Settin beef I'm known for bein that rhyme deader you can't defeat (uhh)
Somethin that was made to never die
I'm here for a reason dats why GOD trusty, nah!

Chorus x2

Verse 2: Smoothe Da Hustler, D.V

If nobody told you I'mma show you
Checkmate your king, overthrow you
You crown me King like checkers
Jump and blow you way out, stay out
My knight's out to put ya day out
I'm losin it, confusin it
Next level mentality to add on, take away reality, I'm usin it
But most don't agree with these tactics
They find MC's in the middle of four wars on their knees
Cos I freak it backwards, backward's how I freak it, peep it
My sanity helps me live it and speak it frequent
Slowly I can capture criminal raptures
The master blowin MC's with minimal batches of rappers

What be the malfunction? Function
Cause the funk, we are the jump just like the junction
Clique policies
Don't y'all place lace, get broken when it step up to these
Ya best to take heed

Chorus x2

Verse 3: Trigger, D.V., Smoothe

With all love, due to the fact I jump funk on tracks
Get down for stacks, my crew can't go for that
And to be exact my gamblin staff stay with a Mac
The clip-on wack 'head for attack, can't find no map

The remedy be in me, I see
Jump funkin, funkin we jump in ??? tha South instantly
Drive-by, the hitman for hire
Settin wack crews on fire
Bow down to your lyrical musical sire
D-aah-V extraordanaire
Kick snares in your end til your jams be def cool, who's left?
Cardiac arrest my chest like DT's or raps, man

Now bring it all to a close, close it off
Put that raw style and the game, froze it off
So it all a boil down to this
Basically facin me you're mistakingly ludicrous
I ain't new to this!

Chorus x3[Intro: Ice-T conversating with his daughter]
[Ice-T] Baby, I wanna let you know I really like how this is going down
[Daugh] Yeah, I like how it's going down too, daddy!
[Ice-T] Though we can make big moves, baby I know, real big moves..
[Daugh] Ummm.. just tell me what I gotta do and I'm down for whatever!

[Chorus: Corte X2]
Girl, if you do what I tell you to
You can have this whole world if you wanted to
Buddy, it ain't going to be easy
Just listen to a player, and please believe me!

[Verse One: Ice-T]
Let's start this off with facts
You got on some nice shoes but you walk in it
You got on nice coat but you're outside it
Now, if you're ready to accept that state you was made in upgrade
Hiding up your game in form
I can let you come over here with me and get real real warm
They say: if you knew better, you'll choose better
And you think wrong, you think wrong
You can't swing a slow batter the fast pitch
The problem with most of you women, y'all so used to loosing
You can't even figure out what you want
Now first, we gotta let you know everything
If you did - you'll be living on the side of the mountains
Somewhere in Seattle like Bill Gates
And I don't know everything that's true
But I definitely do know more than you
One thing is you got style, cause you quote my eye
Two is you got class, that's what makes you fly
Three is you're intelligent cause you're listening to me talk
And four is you're very very sexy, you can see that in the way you walk
But all that ain't work nothing if you don't get it together and move something
Now, this game is played in ones and twos, that means soloists and crews
And that's exactly what I'm trying to do, is team up with you
But you have to learn how to take some instructions, boo
Please believe this, and listen to me

[Chorus: Corte X2]

[Verse Two: Smoothe Da Hustler]
Alright, baby look..
I can see you harmonious cause your rent is more than my mortgage
So it's obvious you ain't got enough left to pay attention
But I.. I'ma renew your lease for a small fee
Then we gonna psychologically house-shop
So you can have some space for that brain of yours
Consider me Real Estate
Now, I can't front, you're fly
And you're hanging around me for some reason so I must be the shelter
They say: conversation is like a combination
So I'ma open that safe, take a turn at it
You want-a dime, yeah, you want-a dime
But your nigga paint you a picture
How much cents do that make?
Alright then.. now, what you should do
Is grow some hands on that forehead of yours
So you can hold that thought
I see you used to get in your way that's why you go on the wrong direction
You need a RUN D.M.C. and 'Walk This Way'
Don't you need two pilots to fly the plane?
But only one get to hold the steering wheel, baby
So sit back, relax your ass, cause you're flying first class
And this going to be a smooth ride, baby, and please believe me

[Chorus: Corte X2]

[Verse Three: Ice-T]
Now, I'ma give you the real deal
I'm going to need at least two more inches on them heels
And that gut made up cool to you, but I'ma ask you for a stirrup or two
And as for your hair.. I ain't even going to go there
Just keep it clean and tight, and would be alright
Overall.. I think you're fine
And I'm sure I can buck out the dime
And this is going to take a little time
First, you got to forget everything you know
Cause right now..
You're on a real course to becoming a real motherfucking whore
Now, that's cool too..
But at least let me show you how to be a motherfucking pro
Cause it ain't going to be all fun
If you're fucking with me, you better duck or run
This is final level of the game baby
And it ain't going to be all biscuits and gravy
You got to have a nerve, for the motherfucking curve
Cause we can do it either way, baby
The street way, or the corporate sweet way
But no matter how me and you do it, girl
It would definitely.. be the elite way

[Interlude: Ice-T and his daughter conversation continues]
[Daugh] Awww! you know, I'm down, baby
[Ice-T] That's what I'm talking about
[Daugh] Ha ha ha ha!
[Ice-T] Yeah, I know you like it when I see you smilling..
[Daugh] Ha ha ha ha ha!
[Ice-T] Yeah girl, I see you're feeling this right..

[Chorus: Corte X2][Intro]
[Trigger] Trigger Tha Gambler
[Ice-T] Iceberg
[Smooth] I'm Smoothe Da Hustler
[Fever] So come check us out, sexmoneyguns.com

[Ice-T]
You know Smooth man, no matter..
No matter how much I love a bitch, man
I could be with a bitch and I really want to marry her, man

[Smooth] Uhha.. what?!

[Ice-T]
And it's something that goes on in my head I can't explain it

[Chorus: Ice-T X2]
Once I bust a nut I'm out
All the real niggas know what I'm talking about
We might take you out to dinner buy you shit, it's crazy
But once I bust a nut I'm Swazy

[Verse One: Smoothe Da Hustler]
I'm on a one O'clock booty call; this girl is a freak
Lights out, drop those drawers, pull back those sheets
But hold up, stand up and throw your head to your feet
And you can bite up on the pillow if I'm in too deep
Bad shots, always sad, I never cuddle in bed
I only cuddle your neck while you're giving me head
And that's all, and I told you, we can fly and the ball
But I'm wrong, we can do it up and buy out the mall
But I'm gone, I'm on the next bus, next club
Next slut, next fuck, fucking the next one, next up
Legs up, how many girls I done hit up and ran?
I'm like smooth I'm already trying to fuck your friends
Then I'm...

[Chorus: Ice-T X2]

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
Sometimes my dick gets hard as a pole
Fucked so many bitches, think my dick went gold
I love the stripping bitches, dancing bitches, fat butt whores
I love the high heeled bitches with them sexy toes
If you're really hot, I might buy you some clothes
Fat enough ass, you'll get to ride on my rolls
Good enough head, might get you some gold
But once I bust off; Daddy is back on the road
Cause once I hit the drawers, I start noticing flaws
Didn't realize your gut was that big or that wig
I'm back in the same club I met you slut
Bitches just demanding me, hard dick insanity
I really loved you up until I fucked you
Uhh.. once I skied, it's kinda like a track meet
How fast can I get some fresh pussy on my dick?
A different type whore, a different color bitch

[Chorus: Ice-T X2]

[Verse Three: Deuce Fever]
I got go to put my pants on
She said where are you going handsome?
Trying to hold a nigga for ransom
After all the shit I bought and then some
Smiling with her mouth full of cum, another one dumb dumb
Got to go, got another whore, waiting for me in the lobby, yo
And plus, she got body too
She is beautiful, toes done to the cuticle
Hold up Ma, you know, what I'll do to you? "BITCH!!"
Chew you out, beat it up, put it your butt
Blindfold you, hand cuffed, then mind mold you
It's all gravy, baby, When I roll through
Bag your whole crew, we can Menage-a-trois it up
While your girl licking my butt
Rubbing my gut, playing with my nuts
Love your shape, wanna squeeze and hold you
Bitch, what I told you?

[Chorus: Ice-T X2]

[Verse Four: Trigger Tha Gambler]
I got this thing for titties and long hair, bitches with curves
But I kick them to the curbs, if they get on my nerves
I swerve to the right, hit the lock, hit the block
Think I'm feeling that hard, to stop playing?
Cause I.. beg them, bag them, beat them in the head
Later, they beat me and beg to meet me in the bed
Damn!! I'm such a good talker
I'm like fuck her cause I could fuck her
But then I threw her dick suck offer
Now homegirl flipping, in her own world tripping
She falls for anything, old girls slipping
I told her roll with her homegirl, both girls dipping
Now me, her and her homegirls switching
So homegirls listen

[Chorus: Ice-T X2][Verse One: Ice-T]
Enough time has passed, false prophets steering you wrong
You won't appreciate my wisdom, 'til I'm dead and I'm gone
Underground dead from combat
Laid down on the floor.. in some club
Girls scream at the ocean of blood
No use to call the paramedics, to hit me with the fifth energetic
Close range, cut in the base of my brain
Blew my face on through some bitch's head, before I hit the ground
Some nigga touched me in the chest, and blew it out with the pound
My niggas didn't have chance to move, they used silenced weaponry
Couldn't hear the sound, as the club bass bound
All you heard was.. Yo, Ice is on the ground
The assassins, when they heard this up, stepped back and mixed in with the crowd
Gloom broke into hysteria, spot went wild
A lot of bitches yelling and crying, while fake niggas smile
I heard voices of my loved ones said I leave the party
God kisses my face as I leave my body

[Interlude: Deuce Fever]
Yo, I wanna see what the fuck's happening!
Yo, yo, back off my man, man! (*Sample of L.A.P.D. sirens*)
Awww shit! y'all

[Chorus: Ice-T X2]
The game is real, anyone can get touched up
Get moved on, left in a plunger blood
No matter how gangster you are, how deep your crew
Niggas can get you if they want to

[Verse Two: Mark Live]
Yo.. yo.. yo.. attack mode
Look, listen, it's the general.. code
Gully and gutter, I roll with some box cutters
I'm bringing.. fucking Jersey City niggas
We got.. tons of triggers, for tons of niggas
We walk and talk a lot, we run some niggas
No glitter and glades, it's guns and niggas
Nightclubs or your social clubs
Backstage with your membrane, on the side of your freeway
It's ugly, the bomb squashed blonde bitch for our shit
It's M-16s switch off clips
Bullets ripped fleshy death right through your kids
Except your bids, except all that shit you did
Uhh.. you can't hide in the town houses
When two niggas are nine-ing like two ounces
Scarface Colombia, Walker Tah's style surrounding, your white bitches out

[Chorus: Ice-T X2]

[Verse Three: Ice-T]
Now, if you faggots got some questions about how real this is
A straight Strong-Arm, half of you niggas in the biz'
Your bodyguard, bitch made, motherfucking fake ass whores
Can't even roll for dolo, walk through your own hood solo
Niggas push up and change-snatch your logo
The truth is.. no homeboys are brought through
Your own crew is destorying you
So now you're carrying guns, you know, you won't shoot
You copped a new whip, had to get a bulletproof
You wanted to be Rap-Star, now, you're too shook to move
Cause the streets say the words, you kid gotta prove
Living a lie, you might die, in this game of hot caption whores
Check your rearview you're being followed

[Chorus: Ice-T X2]

[Verse Four: Trigger Tha Gambler]
Eat the dick, if it be.. we gonna shoot from a block away
We keep with heat, and turn your face into a plot to play
Yeah, we spray out your feet and watch you burn in a flock away
Nerd, niggas stop and pray
Heard, they can't drop the lay
We come out, run out, one route to Dun-house
We're about to blow his wig off "yeah yeah"
Nigga we jump out, pump out, dump out
Infront of the Dun house with the sun-hounds
Shit to peel off and I'm.. running the trot like crooked cops
Taking capes, pushing weight, while I shipped this back
From California to the.. Hill Tah, Comille fitting dots
Activille for them bills and he'll get drop

[verse Five: Smoothe Da Hustler]
Look I.. show guys and buyers we're not kidding
I know the size, brothers stick-bys, when we start spitting
They go beside rocks and dodge with guns ticking
But it's devilish regardless the art is squash business

[Chorus: Ice-T X2][Snow]
It was a lonely, long, and grimey night
I go to see my girl, my Madonna
I've been so lonely, I've been thinkin' 'bout you

[Latoya & Miranda]
It never fails, no matter what I do
I find myself locked up in thoughts of you
Over your kiss, I reminisce by sweet sunlight
And it's your titanic touch, that takes my mind at night
Cause when I'm with you love is so real it's like sweet pain
Just the thought of you takes away the rain
There's nothing I'd rather do than keep you on my mind
Days are short enough, so I don't waste my time
Locked up in you, your love is true, what am I to do?
Wanna make this real, 'bout how I feel, boy what's the deal?
Your love is so real, you got me, you got me

[Chorus]

[Snow]
Hey, way-yo-yeah
Think about you all the time you go away
Hey, know what you say
Spend a little time with me
Get freaky, be your fantasy
Let's ride, let's ride, let's ride

[Smoothe]
Whoever wanna tangle better be ready to hang
I don't tie knots, why not? that ain't my thing (foo')
Catch me blazin' up in my whip, catchin' attitudes
When my flight's delayed, I flip, then I'm raisin' up
Pop the cork and, rearrange and stop your walkin'
The solo type with tigher game than dolomite
I got ya hopin' I stay around, I don't play around
When I rise, I lay it down, bless it and leave
I don't hang around, I'm too rude to be forgotten
You're feelin me right, boo?
That's what you get for stopin'

[Chorus]

[Latoya & Miranda]
In the middle of the night or broad daylight
Won't put up a fight
I'll just relax and let my thoughts take flight
While your honey rides control my world
Boy, my mind 24-7
What can I do?
You know you've got that butter love
I'm thinkin' of, baby you stay on my mind
I'm so 'bout you
Oh, I'm captivated, I can't maintain it
I just don't know what to do

[Chorus][Trigger Tha Gambler]
There a toker, under the numb, scumb looker
Get the gatherin, big willy, me, thug rich and booker
The gun to gun, face off, street smart nigga
That I'm ready to tear your numbers right off the burners
To throw the D-8 trace off, ruckus click cause the mystery
Sellin, which, cap killin, go down in history
You dissin me, bell to releact the combat
I sit back, when niggas throw raps
I be like, "where your are at"

[Rubbabandz]
It's a leaky-leak world and I don't give a fuck
All I wanna do is puff that purple stuff
The sun ain't never shine on my block
It's like a permanent eclipse
The only light is gun spark
Fightin on the premissis, that you want to be yours
Catch your on the stairs, your floor's eight
But, you won't make it past four
I'm sick and tired of niggas actin high fashional
Flashin, wackin and not reactin

[Smoothe Da Hustler]
Yall niggas, know what time it is
Leavin niggas withour no watches
When I drop this shit about hustlin
Yall niggas know, who rhyme it is
You gettin the head from bathroom
To book-book to rap-rap to tracks-tracks to wax-wax
When starts toss the headphone
The dead zone, MC's get done since
The grittiest square root
Equals a dead mother fucker in my circumference
The shell maxed, well matched, dressed in black leather
To come through buildin for buildin
Jack dead for crime cheddar

[Shyheim]
All day, I dream about guns, money, cars and bitches
Thirsty niggas, who want my riches
I got somethin for em, in '96, you gotta be trife or die
That's how it is in the streets of S.I., in god we trust the lye
Niggas I run with, their mentality is fuck it
And heated with a vest, gun cocked ready to buck shit
Altough they do, to makin crack and dope sales
And jiggy-jigg won't stop us from gettin the dough, for real

[Trigger] Money, clips and fat stacks make the world go round
[D.V.] What makes the world go round
[Rubba] Alcohol and marijuana makes the world go round
[D.V.] What makes the world go round
[Smoothe] Cocaine, lactose and boilin water makes the world go round
[D.V.] What makes the world go round
[Shyheim] Big guns, money and pussy makes the world go round
[D.V.] What makes the world go round, round

[Rubbabandz]
Shaolin, Stapleton born and raised
The battlegrounds is where we spend most of our days
I lick a shot for niggas slingin cooked up rocks
To make the prophet, so all yall crap niggas need to stop it
I see my peeps transform like Autobots
Shootin at missed, prime ass niggas, who stop us from makin figgaz
We can't be eliminated, the world wil be contaminated
G.P. players activated

[D.V. Alias Khrist]
Shot twenty shells, twenty heads fell
Twenty bodies rapped, twenty churches rung death bells
The bitch fucker, the thug cop chucker
The Glock under my belt, tucker, the wild mother fucker
My lifestyles, maxin, taxin, a pistol wipin
Girl come here, bitch slapped and carjackin
Cap carrier, contract arrangin, twenty-thousand dollar hit
Body, the scenic

[Shyheim]
Bet your life nigga on two red and one green dice
For fifty cents, nickels or get nice and pay the price
A hot rolex with ice, fit around my wrist
A gorilla in the mist, with a four fifth, kill you and your bitch
Get you open like bullet wounds, deadly like toxic fumes
Get my peoples ??? through all the ballons
Wack rappers and listeners, this for all yall
Can't follow, put my records out on virgin
Cause my styles be sellin

[Smoothe Da Hustler]
Brooklyn and Shaolin puttin the hurtin in front of the curtain
Hookin and crookin, I'm takin back uptown, back downtown like fulton
I house the best, when I be rappin, I be packin
So niggas in clubs, fire marshalls got me on house arrest
Front, I caution it, I bless so many mics
After I die, niggas'll cut my hand off and auction it
Nineteen seventy-seven, february eighth
This little nigga be packin big, but I ain't got faith to hustle it

[Rubba] Thugs, slugs and drugs make the world go round
[D.V.] What makes the world go round
[Trigger] Hand in pistol, pull out the gristle makes the world go round
[D.V.] What makes the world go round

Mr. Trigger makes the world go round
Smoothe Da Hustler, definitely makes the world go round
Shyheim makes the world go round

The Nexx Level Click makes the world go round
It be the crew that makes the world go round
It be the crew, it be the crew that makes the world go round
It be the crew, it be the crew makes the world go round[Chorus: Marc Live - repeat 2X]
Where's your hustle?  Where you from?
What's your street rep?  What have you done?
I don't know you yet, you're not a legend
Fuck your block, you a regular nigga

[Marc Live]
Yo... this is my brand new debut
Welcome to my, twisted life, you'll risk your life
I grew up where the streets are dark
And - kids sell and go to hell in one night
And chicks snitch so quick, yo in milliseconds
The villains home invade, comin to get'cha
My whole level is, gutterest
Dead to rights, no strings attached
Uhh, but not the fun and games
Niggas is backwards, I rip their backs off
Yeah, your team is not thorough
Studio kingpin, I'm pullin your ink pen
Stop writin (stop writin...)
And if you write in your head, stop thinkin
Stop talkin (uhh...)
You Sean Penn nigga, "Dead Man Walking"

[Chorus]

[Smoothe Da Hustler]
Nigga we shut shit down like the marshalls
Padlock and chain, dead cock, padlock your brain
Cats with keys/ki's get chased out the street
BAM!  Ran over by my man Landrover Jeep
I creep, stand over with heat
The plan, ran closer to handover your plan folder to me
So respect it, I'm deeply connected
I'm a survivor, three feet under the street wreckage
I side spectate, Cartier square look
Then Columbine everybody in the yearbook
Cats tellin me they next to acquire
But I respected, reconnected the wire, stupid step in the fire
I'ma do you fouler than Amadou
Roll past you slow gas you drop heat, and watch the fire follow you
Who sellin you dreams of cottonest sheet
Nigga I catch you in your nightmare and rock you to sleep, nigga

[Chorus]

[Marc Live]
Yo, you do regular things, you hug the block
Every weekend you hug the Glock - sucka
You're too scared to, make it happen
I know killers that'll you make you happen - uhh
Look, you won't get it from rappin
This is real life, real shit - yeah
Real Desert Eagle, real people
C'mon yo there's just no sequel
Look, you a full time groupie
I'm soldier nigga, gone off looseleaf
Four star general
You know me, respect me, so salute me
Niggas I blow the game up
Stop playin kid, I'll blow your frame up
And yo, you lame as fuck
I'm veteran, real nigga, get your game up

[Chorus] - 2X
