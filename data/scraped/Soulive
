-Talib Kweli-

Here I am
Sooooouuuulllll
Step out on the block to face the sun
Creep the people in the village that raised my son
As far as days go this look like an amazing one
I feel more normal in the summer the same as the yankees won
It's like of course, what you expect less
The night about to kick off, foks is out in their best dress
Pimps and whores rising on the horizon
Ballers coppin more diamonds
Watch the ?ferrion? looking towards Zion
What's embedded in the hardest head
It's the epic lie to me and debt to a
Country that gives us no credit
So cats stealin money cash hoes cuz
That's what's expected
What's the bill when the original architect is ?kinetic?
Mummies return, so dummies can learn
Just how much Hollywood got to burn
Of our money that's hard-earned
But that really ain't my concern
As I walk the block
When the sun goes down it starts to get hot
Scorchin

[Chorus X2]

Bridge to Bama
Bring your wife, your brother, your kids, your mama
(bring everybody) (your mammy)
Shits bananas (bananas)
The way we paint pictures in a vivid manner
(picture it)

[Verse 2]

Magnetic like refrigerator poetry
Attract imimators who wanna flow like me
You know it's me, floating free
Through the ghetto were the people supposedly
Ain't trying to show no love openly
Give me your hand (yeah)
Trying to build a bridge so we can stay the course
Hi-Tek lay the track for the train of thought to run across
Come across places were faces got tracks of tears
Cuz the human race been runnin up on they backs for years
Yeah, but they don't break
They keep it movin like when I travel the land
And people other people do it
How other people go through it
I'm bridging the gap like the Black Eyed Peas
I'm lovin givin it back, to see them raise up
I'm living for that
To keep trying means you keep failing
But if you don't keep trying
That means you keep dying
What the hell, we gonna die anyway
Keep your soul live when you're here
Is what I'm trying to say

[Chorus X2]
(adlib to end of the song)Uh
Somebody
Uh
Need some helpa!
Get it
Somebody
I don't know how long I can stand for this
Workin' my fingers to the bone and don't get shit(huh)
Strugglin' to pay the rent
Got my check, all the money spent
Now, I got the feelin' this ain't no accident
The rich keep gettin' richer
And the poor just stay the same
They don't wanna hear what we gotta say
But we gon' say it anyway

[Chorus:]
Don't take too much (Too much)
Gon' weigh ya down
Don't take (Too Much)
Gon' take you down
You know we could have (So Much)
If you took just what you need and pass it around
(Pass it around) Good Lord!
Uh!
Get it
Somebody
God Almighty
Yeah-ah
Uh hm
I don't know who they think they are
You know I can't even put gas in my car
And I think you would agree, this corrupt society
Is not a life I wanna lead
But the rich keep gettin' richer
And the poor just stay the same
They don't wanna hear what we gotta say, but
But I gotta say it anyway
Yeah---!

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Your cup is overflowin' (Overflowin')
And mine ain't even half full (Mine ain't even half full, well!!)
Excess gets the best of us
When greed overta-akes your soul (Takes over your soul---!!)
There's enough for all of us (Ah-ah---!!)
If we just take what we need
So, all we gotta do is look out for one another---
Love will set us free
Yeahhhhh!!!

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Chorus:]
T\Too much (Too much)
Gon' weigh ya down
Don't take (Too Much)
Gon' take you down
We could have (So Much)
If you took just what you need and pass it arou-hou-hound!!
(Pass it around)Verse 1: J-Live

Peace
Still ain't the word to play
Still the first word heard when you play a CD by J
Still is what ya can't be if you're live as me
Wide awake third eye moving rapidly
Rappin, rougher than rap and smoother than Anita Baker's Rapture
Well-rounded MC
Actin' not but (?) action stop
Wisdom by the barrel under lock and key
Capture words, attack your nerves
And make them slaves to the rhythm
If ya listen you'll be setting them free
(?) then the god I be
If its just I see the equality over quantity
If its no fool's gold, not a prob for me
It's more than a job for me
If it was, I'd be more than a temp you see
Dedicated by (?)
OD on the dope beat E A T
Soulive and J-Live on the MPC
FYI this be album three
(?) triple threat never run MD
Go to produce, DJ, and MC
Truth seeker where the place to be
Here!
Where the spot (?) and come ya'll
Where the part known as the best ya'll
Here!
Matter of a fact turn it up so ya'll
Hear!
Been on the job since 1995
Changed the game since the moment I arrived and
Setbacks and pitfalls I survived and
Who leave a diamond in the rough so jaded
Green with envy as the next man who made it
But I remain unfazed, unfaded
Keepin' my hands on the mircophone
Settin' the tone like a blade to a whetstone
Before my bills get paid skills get honed
You can't get taht might as well get gone
Here!
Cause right here be the place where
(?)
And short term ambitions are replaced there
Cause man listen while you dissin'
We go from transition
To booth dishin'
It be the same old wishin' with a new vision
And I see
Clear!
To a place where a knowledge of self
Is promoted by the (?) being pushed by the people with wealth
And the bass-ackwards, junk food rappers
Aren't the only one recognized up on the shelf
And the people in the club got a chance to
Dance to something that maintains a little bit of self respect
Cause the people in the booth with the ears on the youth
Really care about the music that you
Hear!
Maybe then the J-Live aid
Hear!
When you let the radio rage
Here!
And the dopest MC's get slayed
Here!
Matter fact turn it up all the way
Yeah!
Get a little bit of this underground
Underrated, unexaggerated, appreciated
Anticipated even though we're still underestimated
Get up under the influence of the most fluent students of life
No man alive graduated
In this class super senior, the celebrated
Get up under the undercurrent
Under current events of one nation under currency
I'll serve you a mental death sentence concurrently
Get some of this potion
The most potent, important, imported
From a place where the taste make you swim for it
Yeah!
Get your good foot up on the good ship, craftsmanship
Set sail roundtrip
From the mind to the lip to the ear to the mind
Here!
Never mind the blind leading the dumb
Till the only ones left are the deaf and the doped up
Till the deaf and dumb give their hopes up not
Here!
You in a place where we skippin' over
The worst part where land so desolate
And the pessimists stuck on stressin' it
And the outsiders that make a mess of it
This The Hear After, the next testament
I know the mic sound right
Fuck testin' it
I just get on the beat and start blessin' it
Thats the intro enjoy the rest of it
Here!Verse 1: J-Live

Here I am
Sooooouuuulllll
Step out on the block to face the sun
Creep the people in the village that raised my son
As far as days go this look like an amazing one
I feel more normal in the summer the same as the yankees won
It's like of course, what you expect less
The night about to kick off, foks is out in their best dress
Pimps and whores rising on the horizon
Ballers coppin more diamonds
Watch the ?ferrion? looking towards Zion
What's embedded in the hardest head
It's the epic lie to me and debt to a
Country that gives us no credit
So cats stealin money cash hoes cuz
That's what's expected
What's the bill when the original architect is ?kinetic?
Mummies return, so dummies can learn
Just how much Hollywood got to burn
Of our money that's hard-earned
But that really ain't my concern

When the sun goes down it starts to get hot
