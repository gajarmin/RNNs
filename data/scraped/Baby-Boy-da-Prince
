[Hook]
This is the way I live
Lil’ Boy still pushin’ big wheels
I stack my money, lay low, and chill
Don’t need to work hard that’s the way I feel, I feel, I
This is the way I live
Lil’ Boy still pushin’ big wheels
I stack my money, lay low, and chill
Don’t need to work hard that’s the way I feel, I feel, I
This is the way I live

[Verse 1]
Six months later now we’re big dog status
Name elevated but I still act average
Rockin’ shows in Dallas, ball like I play for the Mavericks
West Bank rapper and I’m one of the baddest
French Riviera spot and I’m getting in shape man
I think I’m Super M-a-n without a cape man
Ridin’ all day hustlin’; all for the cake man
I’m a Benjamin stack one inch taller than Great Danes
First they made cheap Ray-Ban like a felon
I’m growin’ up now spittin’ hotter than Mohellans
I’m a steal every girl ever gon’ to fly
I’m a young little dude, stay runnin’ from cops
Emerald Row is the place where I got my props
People love me in da hood they don’t want me to stop
So uhh, that’s the only way I know how to rock
And I’m a stay rappers like won’t stop ‘til I drop

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I I’s Baby Boy and I done it again
I’m ridin fly with D-Wizzle in ‘cedes Benz
Twenty two wanna ride with the ladies then
Red Bull, Grey Goose, now the ladies bent
Now we go and do a thing under a shady tent
And they don’t question what I say cause I’m a ladies pimp
See this little one right here this fellow got stripes
And I is represent, my rail room for life
Money in my pocket but I still act trife
While I in da club they say the parlor a’int right
Look I’m-doing great that’s the way I feel
Hustlin’ hard all day that’s the way I live

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
This the two-seat rider with the ketchup inside
Red pepper paint must believe my ish ride
They pause like stop signs when they rollin’ up
Cause’ when the doors open up, they open UP
I’m Lamboin’ it I was stashed, off stage I’m throwin’ it
Cause they say I’m like Katrina with money, I blow the shhhh
Real been gravy, three years out of da eighties
Solos, shabo’s valley animals played it
Commodores mirages, not the Nike hirages
It cost 250 on up to put your foot inside this
Y’all was wearing rocks that was my time to shine
Don’t give me viesels y’all thinkin’ this McDonalds size
I been fly I I I I I I I I from the crib to the ri I I I I I de
Fifty-Four inch screens 26 inches from the ceiling dude
The plasma look like a projector up in da livin’ room homie!

[Hook][Intro]
Good evening
Introducing, a West Bank, Marrero representer
Straight from West Bank, New Orleans
Baby Boyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy

[Baby Boy]
You boys think I'm crippled cause I walk with a limp
A lil' shrimp, and I talks like a pimp
My momma had faith, never ever was a failure
Choppa City c'mon, now I'm sweatin like a welder
Now we gettin shows, makin Legends like Zelda
I was on the bench, now they got me in the game
People jumpin out of vans, now we jumpin out of planes
Man I'm a B-A-B-Y Boy
A slim lil' dude but I ride big toys
And if you're from that West Bank holla at'cha boy
And my East Bank niggas pop a collar for ya boy
It's Baby Boy Da Prince and I'm worth 10 figures
And I'm from Marrero and this my set ni-gga~![Intro]
We gettin money over here, hey; I'm

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Gettin rich y'all, and I'm blowin real fast
Cause I really hustle hard for my cash
I don't care about another man's money
Cause Baby Boy he got his own damn money

[Baby Boy Da Prince]
I'm gettin rich y'all, check out the karats in my wrist boy
The way I'm iced out I know you hate this boy
I switched to dank from {?} now it's {?} boy
Done copped a ride and a lot of niggas pissed boy
No FEMA checks, hustle hard, this a rich boy
New clothes, new style, new kicks boy
The reason why I claim rich cause I got a lil' change
I'm tryin to get the new Range
The reason why I say I'm blowin real fast
Is I just got in the game and I got a lil' cash
Don't need to work hard, that's the way I feel
But if I don't hustle dawg I can't pay my bills; I'm

[Hook]

[Baby Boy Da Prince]
This year I gotta shine, this year I gotta grind
This year I gotta hustle, this year I'm gon' blow
No purp stain on my lips I stay out of trouble
Cause niggas be provokin me to put 'em in a tussle
But now I cain't do it, I got a positive mindframe~!
I'm somethin like Spike, I can only do right thangs
God blessed me with a talent now it's time to show off
6 years in the game now it's time to go off
The rapper that I'm bein, I'm tight with no flaws
If you don't hustle hard then you dog with no claws
Hard work straight grindin now I'm almost the boss
Really nuttin changed just my ice and my cars

[Hook]

[Baby Boy Da Prince]
Look I don't care about another man's money
Cause finally I got my own damn money
I can't get cut short cause I got my own shit
I can't get set back cause I own my own shit
I done made it to the start and now I gotta finish
I'm talkin gettin lil' money but now I'm gettin plenty
Grey Goose, Belvedere, I done bagged off some Henny
And I'm still from the block but don't call me Jenny
Call me Baby Boy, I'm a Prince of the game
I'm stuck on my money like a pimp with his cane
Take another peek at, my neck and my wrist boy
Bank account sky high, cause I'm gettin rich boy

[Hook]

What you say now - gettin money {*4X*}
What you say now - I done done it again {*4X*}

Extreme Universal
Hardness on the track
And that's that, a known fact[Intro]
