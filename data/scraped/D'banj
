[Intro: D'Banj]
Stuttering
Giving 'em rest and making love again
In my best, I be the run again
And I have the man dem stuttering

[Hook: D'banj]
I'm getting this nigga in the morning
He gon' think he been chiefing, just too long when
He see me in the evening, wanna catch all these feelings
Well, let me be the first to get mine, ohh

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Barbeque and blow in the back of the crib
Sitting and counting, smoking a spliff, this shit's a gift
All my niggas watches is rough, grabbing our crotches
Yelling what up? The jeans cost $500? Fuck
Stop it, keep baking, see, the smell it's a statement
One freeze of this shit, you won't feel your legs kid
I'm a gangsta corporate hustla, my voice is illustrious
Hounded by vicious dons, nigga we armed, trust me bruh
They yelling Chef, kill the plate with the cooks
I say 'Ye with 2 Chainz on, we Common, let's Push
Burn another bush, then burn another we brothers
Love us or not, the Mark Zuckerbergs of the block
Hug a knot, staying rich, we was built for the guap
Park the green six deuce on the deuce just props
Rock a kilt, mean Glock, I'm all machinery, ock
Cling to me, now see how the scenery rock?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Common]
I was born by a lake, chicken shack, and a church
That mean the flow got wings and it come from the dirt
Godly, I know she wanna test the 'Rari
Eye on a dollar like Illuminati
Life is foggy, tryna see through the mist of it
Could have been living it, you was Mrs. Mischievous
This is just a letter to better your development
Situation delicate

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Some claim God body, blame Illuminati
All cause his pockets now knotty as his hair, yeah
All Sonny, no Cher, only solitaires
You clusterfucks could cluster up
On tippy-toe and still not muster up
So it's (ashes to ashes, dust to dust)
In God we trust, the game is all us
'til the sky calls or it's flames on us, Push

[Hook]

[Verse 4: 2 Chainz]
2 Chainz!
I'm chilling in my camo, flipping through the channel
On my GOOD Music shit, my logo's a Lambo
Four doors of ammo, ammunition I'm pitching
To make your body switch another position

[Verse 5: CyHi Da Prince]
I hope the people is listening, I could never sell my soul
I gave it back to God at my christening
It's tickeling when I hear what haters be whispering
What makes you think an Illuminati would ever let some niggas in?
Fake friends and siblings
Like to wish you well but ain't never flip the nickel in
Haters wanna pull they pistol when they see me in this race car
But you can't spell war without an A-R
15, I was pushing carts at K-Mart
By 21, they said I'd be inside a graveyard
Can't wait to get that black American Express
So I can show them white folks how to really pull the race card

[Break: Kid Cudi & (Kanye West)]
Yeah, you feeling on top now, getting that money nigga?
(You sold your soul)
Yeah, you feeling on top now, getting that money nigga?
(You sold your soul)
Yeah, you feeling on top now, getting that money nigga?
(Naw man, mad people was fronting
Aw man, made something from nothing)

[Outro: Kanye West]
I treat the label like money from my shows
GOOD woulda been God except I added more O's
If I knew she was cheating and still bought her more clothes
It's cause I was too busy with my Baltimore, you know
Some people call that the art of war, you know
I guess it depends what you falling for, the clothes?
Cars, money, girls and the clothes
Aw money, you sold your soul
Nah man, mad people was fronting
Goddamn, we made something from nothing[Verse 1]
I have a confession, don’t take it personal
I have a confession, so you got to listen
I have a confession, don’t take it personal
See I like Beyonce, but she dey with Jigga
I like Nicki, her yansh is bigger
I like Rihanna, she dey make me day go Gaga
I like Omotola 'cos people like her
I like Genevieve cos I think that she’s so sweet
And Nadia Buhari 'cos she no dey drink garri
It’s not her fault you know
You cannot blame me though
I wanna have them all
I know it but the truth is that
I am just an Oliver

[Hook]
Oliver, Oliver, Oliver Twist

You got a secret, but I think I know it
You want to let it out but them go call you ashy
You like to do it, do the hmm hmmm mmm mmm
I know you like D’banj and you like Don Jazzy
You like 2baba and you like Fally Pupa
And I know you love Trey Songz but you no fit sing his songs
I jealous wat u know I do not blame you though
You wanna have them all, you know which one
But the truth is that
You’re just an Oliver

GOOD Music, Yeezy
(I'm D'Banj)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
If you ask me
Anybody who ain’t tell you you was beautiful today need their ass beat
As we proceed, Island breeze, light the weed
I couldn’t find the words on how I feel
But what I lacked in skill I made up for in real
Time, the most precious thing a man could give
Because what she givn' back is why that man can live
We need to take a break, minus the screech, oh
Find a resort, what? Private beach, Oooh
Pina colada sippin', by the sunset
My mission is to find every position, we ain't done yet

[Hook : D'banj]
Take my heart, take my love
Take my body, come build my home
Stay with me di Iyawo mi
Cause you love me

I will be your Scape goat honey
Cause you came through for me
You gave me break through baby (x2)

[Verse 2: D'banj]
Baby Boo I can see your eyes
Say you don jam many fools for your life
Them go come as lovers as them disguise
But as time goes by, na your body be the price
Your back side sef...wey you carry na die
That's why sometimes I no dey surprise
Them go say them love you but that na lie
Chop and clean mouth, tell you bye bye
Me sef i no tell you say na me holy pass
Some people dey talk say i dey use jazz
Them say I bush, Some say I razz
Them say I be nobody, I no get class, Well
I've been bad and I know it and I'm sorry - wanna show it
But no one would give me a chance to prove myself
Despite what you've heard of me
You still went ahead to be with me
You have chosen to be there for me
To you, I make this vow
I say...

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
You getting louder than a two year old drumset
That's a mean gift, you work a mean stick
You’re like a phoenix, you could be my phoenix
Just rub your hands all over my v-neck
Swag, swag on Mach 5
Pac, cause don't it feel like Pac alive?
Feel my apocalypse, feel like I could just
Touch heaven with a Godess in my fingertips
And I’m just trying to kiss every single lips
Hey Yeezy, what’s your next single is?
That D'banj causing hysteria
Soon as we hop of the plane in Nigeria

[Hook]

[Outro]
Omo toh good oh (toh good oh)

But I leave am for God
Cos at the end of the day when my people see me

The way that I metamorphous
Make we bone them
If them still dey yan (yan)
Make them go do somersault on top stage

You only have one life to live
If you're lucky then you might get two
I was down so down to the heat
Wasn't a miracle that got me through

I’ve seen the world - paid my dues, ah
Got plenty of cars but nothing to lose, tonight

{Chorus}
I’m on top of the world
In front of the crowd, eh oh, eh oh oh
Smoke in the air, look at me now, eh oh, eh oh oh
Oh oh baby, oh oh baby
I’m on top of the world
In front of the crowd, eh oh, eh oh oh

{D'Banj}
Hmmn, looking back now, there’s no regrets
Moving forward, that’s all is left
Wouldn’t change a thing even if I could
I’m stronger now, which was for the...

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
If you ask me
Anybody who ain’t tell you you was beautiful today need their ass beat
As we proceed, Island breeze, light the weed
I couldn’t find the words on how I feel
But what I lacked in skill I made up for in real
Time, the most precious thing a man could give
Because what she givn' back is why that man can live
We need to take a break, minus the screech, oh
Find a resort, what? Private beach, Oooh
Pina colada sippin', by the sunset
My mission is to find every position, we ain't done yet

[Hook : D'banj]
Take my heart, take my love
Take my body, come build my home
Stay with me di Iyawo mi
Cause you love me

I will be your Scape goat honey
Cause you came through for me
You gave me break through baby (x2)

[Verse 2: D'banj]
Baby Boo I can see your eyes
Say you don jam many fools for your life
Them go come as lovers as them disguise
But as time goes by, na your body be the price
Your back side sef...wey you carry na die
That's why sometimes I no dey surprise
Them go say them love you but that na lie
Chop and clean mouth, tell you bye bye
Me sef i no tell you say na me holy pass
Some people dey talk say i dey use jazz
Them say I bush, Some say I razz
Them say I be nobody, I no get class, Well
I've been bad and I know it and I'm sorry - wanna show it
But no one would give me a chance to prove myself
Despite what you've heard of me
You still went ahead to be with me
You have chosen to be there for me
To you, I make this vow
I say...

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
You getting louder than a two year old drumset
That's a mean gift, you work a mean stick
You’re like a phoenix, you could be my phoenix
Just rub your hands all over my v-neck
Swag, swag on Mach 5
Pac, cause don't it feel like Pac alive?
Feel my apocalypse, feel like I could just
Touch heaven with a Godess in my fingertips
And I’m just trying to kiss every single lips
Hey Yeezy, what’s your next single is?
That D'banj causing hysteria
Soon as we hop of the plane in Nigeria

[Hook]

[Intro: D'Banj]
Stuttering
Giving 'em rest and making love again
In my best, I be the run again
And I have the man dem stuttering

[Hook: D'banj]
I'm getting this nigga in the morning
He gon' think he been chiefing, just too long when
He see me in the evening, wanna catch all these feelings
Well, let me be the first to get mine, ohh

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Barbeque and blow in the back of the crib
Sitting and counting, smoking a spliff, this shit's a gift
All my niggas watches is rough, grabbing our crotches
Yelling what up? The jeans cost $500? Fuck
Stop it, keep baking, see, the smell it's a statement
One freeze of this shit, you won't feel your legs kid
I'm a gangsta corporate hustla, my voice is illustrious
Hounded by vicious dons, nigga we armed, trust me bruh
They yelling Chef, kill the plate with the cooks
I say 'Ye with 2 Chainz on, we Common, let's Push
Burn another bush, then burn another we brothers
Love us or not, the Mark Zuckerbergs of the block
Hug a knot, staying rich, we was built for the guap
Park the green six deuce on the deuce just props
Rock a kilt, mean Glock, I'm all machinery, ock
Cling to me, now see how the scenery rock?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Common]
I was born by a lake, chicken shack, and a church
That mean the flow got wings and it come from the dirt
Godly, I know she wanna test the 'Rari
Eye on a dollar like Illuminati
Life is foggy, tryna see through the mist of it
Could have been living it, you was Mrs. Mischievous
This is just a letter to better your development
Situation delicate

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Some claim God body, blame Illuminati
All cause his pockets now knotty as his hair, yeah
All Sonny, no Cher, only solitaires
You clusterfucks could cluster up
On tippy-toe and still not muster up
So it's (ashes to ashes, dust to dust)
In God we trust, the game is all us
'til the sky calls or it's flames on us, Push

[Hook]

[Verse 4: 2 Chainz]
2 Chainz!
I'm chilling in my camo, flipping through the channel
On my GOOD Music shit, my logo's a Lambo
Four doors of ammo, ammunition I'm pitching
To make your body switch another position

[Verse 5: CyHi Da Prince]
I hope the people is listening, I could never sell my soul
I gave it back to God at my christening
It's tickeling when I hear what haters be whispering
What makes you think an Illuminati would ever let some niggas in?
Fake friends and siblings
Like to wish you well but ain't never flip the nickel in
Haters wanna pull they pistol when they see me in this race car
But you can't spell war without an A-R
15, I was pushing carts at K-Mart
By 21, they said I'd be inside a graveyard
Can't wait to get that black American Express
So I can show them white folks how to really pull the race card

[Break: Kid Cudi & (Kanye West)]
Yeah, you feeling on top now, getting that money nigga?
(You sold your soul)
Yeah, you feeling on top now, getting that money nigga?
(You sold your soul)
Yeah, you feeling on top now, getting that money nigga?
(Naw man, mad people was fronting
Aw man, made something from nothing)

[Outro: Kanye West]
I treat the label like money from my shows
GOOD woulda been God except I added more O's
If I knew she was cheating and still bought her more clothes
It's cause I was too busy with my Baltimore, you know
Some people call that the art of war, you know
I guess it depends what you falling for, the clothes?
Cars, money, girls and the clothes
Aw money, you sold your soul
Nah man, mad people was fronting
Goddamn, we made something from nothingYa[Intro]

[Hook x2]
You can't see me no more
You can't hold me no more
You can't see me no more
You can try, oh you can try

[Verse 1]
Walking heavens, hallelujah
Feel the trials, but Imma triumph
Nothin' to worry, not in a hurry
You can say what you want, we standin' like a mummy
Oh, I'm lovin' the life that I'm livin' right now
Have friends in high places right now
I'm makin' more than I'm spendin' right now
People talkin', tryna start that shit [?]
Oh I'm lovin' that
Oh I'm lovin' that
Oh I'm lovin' that
Oh I'm love, oh
Oh I'm lovin' that
Oh I'm love....
