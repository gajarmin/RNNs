[Big Punisher]
Ready for war Joe, how you wanna blow they spot
I know these dirty cops that'll get us in if we murder some wop
Hop in your Hummer, the Punisher's ready
Meet me at Vito's with Noodles, we'll do this dude while he's slurping spaghetti
Everybody kiss the fucking floor, Joey Crack
Buck em all if they move, Noodles shoot that fucking whore
Dead in the middle of Little Italy little did we know
That we riddled some middlemen who didn't do diddly

[Fat Joe]
It'll be a cold day in hell the day I take an L
Make no mistake for real I wouldn't hesitate to kill
I'm still the fat one that you love to hate
Catch you at your mother's wake, smack you then I whack you with my snub trey-eight

[Big Punisher]
I rub your face off the Earth and curse your family children
Like Amityville I drill the nerves in your cavity filling
Insanity's building a pavilion in my civilian
The cannon be the anarchy that humanity's dealing
A villain without remorse, who's willing to out your boss
Forever and take all the cheddar like child support

[Fat Joe]
I support Pun in anything he does, anything he loves
My brother from another mother sent from the above
A thug nigga just like me, one of the best -- might be
Even better leaving niggas kneeling on they right knee

[Big Punisher]
Spike Lee couldn't paint a better picture
You small change, I'm blowing out your brains getting richer

[Fat Joe]
Hit you with the Mac, smack your bitch, nigga what?
You getting stuck, my trigger finger's itchy as a fuck!

[Big Punisher]
Truck jewels, cruising in the Land, pumping "Cash Rules"
Last crew to want it caught a hundred trying to pass through

[Fat Joe]
That's true (So who the next to get it?)
TS the best that did it (Get it off your chest kid admit it and it's)

[Hook]
Yeah, and you don't stop!
(Twenty shot Glock with the cop killers fill 'em to the top)
Yeah, and you don't stop!
Joey cracks the rock, and Big Pun keeps the guns cocked)
Yeah, and you don't stop!
(We'll make it hot nigga, what bring it I blow your whole spot
Yeah, and you don't stop!
It's still one-eight-seven on an undercover cop

[Big Punisher]
Fuck the police, I squeeze first, make em eat dirt
Take em feet first through the morgue, then lodge 'em in the deep earth
The street's cursed, the first amendment's culturally biased
Supposed to supply us with rights, tonight I hold my rosary tight as I can
I'm one man against the world, just me and my girl
Black Pearl Latina mas fina but keeps it real
You know the deal, we steal from the rich and keep it
Peep it it's no secret, watch me and Joe go back and forth and freak it

[Fat Joe]
Creep with me, as I cruise in my Beemer
All the kids in the ghetto call me Don Cartagena
Kicking ass as I blast off heat, and
You never see me talk to police, though
You should know that I really don't care
Pull you by the hair, slit your throat, and I'll leave you right there
So beware it's rare that niggas want beef, Big Pun speak
And let these motherfuckers know how we run the streets

[Big Punisher]
Fuck peace, I run the streets deep with no compassion
Puerto Ricans known for slashing catching niggas while they sleeping
No relaxing, keep your eyes open, sharp reflexes
Three techses in the Jeep Lexus just in case police test us
Street professors, Terror Squad, ghetto scholars
Full-a-clips mob, inflicts the fear of God when the metal hollers
Better acknowledge or get knocked down until I'm locked and shot down
Heather B. couldn't make me put my Glock Down

[Fat Joe]
We lock towns like rounds in the chamber
Boogie Down major like Nine, I bust mine
Every time plus I'm the crime boss of New York
Where we taught to walk the walk, all my niggas carry chalk
And stalk, I prey like the Predator
Whoever want it, go and get it set it baby and I'mma bury ya
So remember the Squad that I'm repping
I fill a clip of my weapon and Punish niggas 'til it's armaggedeon

[Hook][Hook - Ja Rule]
I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips, Nigga I'm from New York (New York)
I got a semi-automatic that spits next time if you talk (you talk)
I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips, Nigga I'm from New York (New York)
I got a semi-automatic that spits next time if you talk (you talk)
(And I know)

[Verse 1 - Ja Rule]
Y'all niggas is pussy, punani, vagina
Your Monologue's getting tired, now it's time to ride
Your Print distrified, you're no longer desired
So take off them silly chains, put back on your wire
I'm on fire
Harley dipped in octane
Let east coast bang, let west coast bang
And Rule gonna bring the ghetto gospel
To every 'hood possible, pushin through in the sky blue
Back with the gods you now, preferably the 4 pound
Slugs flyin at the speed of sound
Tryin to catch the ears of niggas that's runnin their mouths
I might get my Brooklyn niggas to run in your house
I don't really understand what the runnin's about
But we're hunters, we take pride in airin our prey out
Leavin 'em layed out, dead, in just a sport
Cause we ain't playin up here in New York

[Hook - Fat Joe]
I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips, Nigga I'm from New York (New York)
And you can tell the way the homie spit, That nigga, I'm from New York (New York)
I got a hundred ways to make a grip, Yes, I'm from New York (New York)
And you can tell I get real ignorant, cause nigga, I'm from New York (New York)
(And this is how we do)

[Verse 2 - Fat Joe]
Nigga I can see the coke in your nose
This ain't a movie, even he got his head blown on the globe
And I was just about to find god
But now that Ma$e is back, I think I'd much rather find a menage
And everybody talkin' crazy how they're AK spit
But we done did some investigatin', and they ain't spray shit
Not me, I'm the truth homie, got the industry shook like
"Naw nigga, Joe gonna let 'em loose on me"
True Story, I'm bringing the team back
Even Roy Jones was forced to Lean Back
My nigga Dre said grind cook
Now we killin them hard, niggas said I must of found Pun's rhyme book
Got bitches on top of the Phantom
And the pinky got bling, like the ring around Saturn
Cook coke, crack, niggas fiend for that
And you already know the x is where the team be at

[Hook - Jadakiss]
I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips, Nigga I'm from New York (New York)
Ruff Ryde, and D-Block and shit, Nigga fuck what you thought (you thought)
And you can't take shit for granted, because life is too short (too short)
I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips, Nigga I'm from New York
(Aha, and this is how we do)

[Verse 3 - Jadakiss]
I swear it couldn't be sweeter, Life's a bitch
Depending on how you treat her, you might get rich
It's guaranteed you gonna die, you might get missed
For maybe 2 or 3 hours, 'til they light their spliffs
And that coke will get you a long time
But when I let 'em know the dope is out, it's like America Online
Wise has awoken
And you know they say that you deserved it whenever you die with your eyes open
I still hold a title, because I'm in the hood like them little motorcycles
Stick up kids, hoppin out with them old rifles
Just doin shit for nothing, it's so spiteful
Ha I'm just like you
Word that niggas wanna murk you is in the air
A double shot of yak and the purple is in the air
And I'm not cocky, I'm confident
So when you tell me I'm the best it's a compliment

[Hook - Ja Rule, Jadakiss & Fat Joe]
I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips, Nigga I'm from New York (New York)
And you can tell the way the homie spit, That nigga, I'm from New York (New York)
I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips, Nigga I'm from New York (New York)
I got a semi-automatic that spits next time if you talk (you talk)
(And this is how we do)[Verse 1: T.I.]
Started in Atlanta, then I spread out with it
South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi
On to North Carolina, Philadelphia, Virginia
From down in Miami where it warm in the winter
On up to Minnesota where it storm in the winter
Jacksonville, Tallahassee, Memphis, Tenn; holla at me
Be in H-Town, Southside, Cloverland, daddy
I'm the man out in Dallas, better ask Khaled
Kept me out in Cali with my eyes open barely
Blowing and spinning: going down Bennett
Drop 6-4, 3-wheel, then switch it
Red light stop, make it drop for the bitches
Got a Glock 4/5th, blow your head off with it
Anything you hear that I said, I meant it
King got the crown then sped off it wit' it
Say you need bricks, I said I get it

[Refrain: Akon]
If you want to, we can supply you
Got enough work to feed the whole town
They won't shoot you unless you try to
Come around and try to stomp on our ground
Cause we takin' over, one city at a time

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Boss, it's what I does
I get money er'ryday, er'ryday I does
That Benz is how I ride
Black flag on the left, 2 hoes and ride
You better move
AK all day
Get shot up like Shyne, that's on my neck
I'm big like Diddy
Damn it, I'm with it
Khaled, we did it
Biggie of my city
Please no fitted, fuck it, I'm too pretty
I'd rather get brain, stupid, I'm silly
Money that come running like water
Mami so hot, damn it, she gorgeous
Miami on fire; you better be cautious
Might get shot on the porch of your fortress
Now they see that you know I'm from Port City
I running cause Rick Ross is boss-shit

[Refrain]

[Verse 3: Fat Joe]
Blat, when you see crack, better duck
Like the mac gotta e-z pass, nigga what
Shit, I don't give fuck, I run these streets
Y'all talk that shit, I walk that beef
I'ma tell you like a G told me
They'll come back quick if a nigga O.D
Cash Rule Everything Around Me
I'm YSL, Versace
You could see me in that Porsche GT
Coming down Sunset, sitting on D's
Feelin' like 'Pac, All Eyez On Me
Fresh bandanna and I'm blowin' mad trees
Nigga please, I spit crack, every verse a ki
Some say Kal-id, some say Col-eed
Twelve years down and I'm finally free

[Refrain]

[Verse 4: Birdman]
Birdman daddy, I'm number one
Nigga came at me wrong so we got him done
Fuckin' with the fam, I'mma give him son
Spent that corner, he didn't run
Sunday had a whole church singing a song
Why'd they have to send my baby home
Fuckin' with some niggas, that paper long
Been a G in the game now my son on the throne

[Verse 5: Lil Wayne]
I am the beast
Feed me rappers or feed me beats
I'm untamed, I need a leash
I'm insane, I need a shrink
I love brain, I need a leech
Why complain on easy street
I don't even talk, I let the Visa speak
And I like my Sprite Easter-pink
And my wristwear Chopard but the Muller's cooler
I have more jewels than your jeweler
Touch and I will bust your medulla
That's a bullethole, it is not a tumor
Red light, read light, stop the rumors
I stay on track like a box of Pumas
Now just r-r-rock with Junior
I am the Little Big Kahuna, y'dig?[Hook: T-Pain]
All I do is win, win, win, no matter what
Got money on my mind I can never get enough
Whenever me and Khaled do the remix everybody's hands go up
And they stay there
And they stay yea
And they stay there
Up, down, up, down, up, down
Cause all I do is win, win, win
And if you going in put your hands in the air make em stay there

[Verse 1: DJ Khaled]
Sittin' on the top floor, what you think I'm hot for
Every summer drop more, hits to make my stock go, up
Them hands go, up; them fans go, up
I'm number one in this bitch and I'ma, stay there
We the best of the best, grind while you haters just sleep
I'm yellin' "free Weezy", I rep the heart of the streets
Who hotter than me, I'm wearin' the crown
We can't stop, won't stop; go hate on me now

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I could never get enough when it come to gettin' fetti
Niggas ain't ready for my Ferrari Scaglietti
Mario Andretti, money comin' fast
My honeycomb hideout is made of all glass
I could never be a racist, wake up every morning just to count white faces
Neo in the Matrix, glorious as Morpheus
Employed all warriors, I'm mean as a scorpion, Dr. Kevorkian

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Everytime I come you gotta know a nigga comin'
Get a lot of money when I'm in the buildin'
And I come and say there ain't [motherfuck ?] nobody better, better, better, better!
Uh-huh, Okay
Niggas know I got you when I hit you with the pitter-patter
Whenever they see me then you hear a lot of chitter-chatter
Niggas know there ain't nobody better, better, better, better!
I watch a lot of niggas when I'm in the cut
So sick when I come and hit 'em in the gut
You will crown me king (no matter what!)
(Kill 'em!)
Ok, let's shine my friend
Get up on my grind again
Some niggas will be happy that I chose to rhyme with them cause

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Diddy]
Her heart racing like she snort cocaine
I got a billion reasons you should know my whole name
Got the most paper Mr. New York Times
I'm a natural born winner nigga New York mines
Everybody getting money but I cop the first six
Now I run the game so I toss the first pitch
Yea, I'll let you wife her but she still my first bitch
If it's less then nine digits nigga, that ain't fuckin' rich mother fucker

[Verse 5: Nicki Minaj]
Ayo, all I do is win, ain't that the reason that you really mad
Undisputed hailing all the way from Trinidad
I ain't mad ma, see you on your bummy swag
I'm in that money green Jag, lot of money bags
I told Khaled you the best but I'm the bestest
Better run for cover if your name is on my checklist
You could talk slick, all the way down to the welfare
Ask the IRS bitch, I'm paying for your health care

[Verse 6: Fabolous]
I'ma make this here official, Let me clear some issues
First off I am not for Britney Spears initials
Thats no B-S, at your re-quest
Lean back you and your crew, Fat Joe, T-S
Yea it's Young Funeral, all black on me
So act like summers over and fall back homey
Winnin' is all I do, I'll answer all of you
But y'all ain't sayin' shit, like prank callers do

[Hook]

[Verse 7: Jadakiss]
It's already proven, I got them birds movin'
All I do is win, I'm allergic to losin'
Yellow gold cuban, nine mil Ruger
I'll show you what to do with em
Finish em, I'm through with em
They gon have to jump me, it's gon take a few of em
They don't want no problems, they might end up suing em
Disassociate yourself, have nothing to do with em
We already got a jet, we tryna get two of em

[Verse 8: Fat Joe]
Just blew trial, crack lobsters Little Italy
Your wife she a screamer yellin' slow down Joe, you killin' me
Beat her like a prize fight mommy I’m a rude boy
You just hit the Power Ball, everyday a new toy
Nigga it’s a stick up, a motherfuckin' robbery
I done did some things that have Haitian Jack proud of me
Ridin' through Harlem me and Jeezy pardon me
Puffy surfin' on the hood for niggas that keep doubtin' me

[Hook][Verse 1: Keith Murray]
I'm here to make a dollar out of 15 cents
And let my balls hang like I'm on a toilet taking a shit
My style is all that and a big bag of chips with the dip
Fuck all that sensuous shit
I represent intellectual violence
And leave your clique holier than the 10 Commandments
Like Redman I shift with the ruck
If your if was a spliff we'd be all fucked up (Word up)
No need to ask you who is he, son I get busy
Scuff my Timbs on the boulevard of many ruff cities
(Chicago, LA, any of 'em) I'll have to Norman Bate you
I love ta hate you cause youse a freak by nature
Can't wait to face you, mutilate you
Drink your style down straight with no chaser
My verbal combat's like a mini-Mac to your back
As soon as one of you niggas try to over react
The L.O.D. love good confrontation or vamp
Break your concentration, murder your camp
For tha jealous, overzealous, we fellas
Blow the the spot like Branford Marsalis
Niggas coming through and acting wild
Y'all commercial niggas better have a coke and a smile, I shot you

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
I conversate with many men, it's time to begin again
Forgot what I already knew, ayo, you hear me friend
Illuminati want my mind, soul and my body
Secret society, trying to keep they eye on me
But I'm stay incogni', in places they can't find me
Make my moves strategically, the G.O.D
It's sorta similar but iller than a chess player
I use my thinker, it coincides with my blinker
While you wondered what we saying on the records real
Yeah, you mothafuckin' right kid you know the deal
My Mobb is Infamous just like the fuckin' title read
You get back slapped so hard make ya nose bleed
Some [def] kids feeling guilty 'bout the [space shit]
The truth hurts baby girl so just face it (Alright)
But anyway, back on the real side of things
My niggas sling cracks and wear fat diamond rings
Not only is it inside the songs that we sing
Everything is real not just a song that we sing
From my life to the paper, very accurately
Give you all of my two so maybe you can three
Prodigy will forever will S-H-I-N-E
My shit attract millions like the moon attract the sea
How dare you ever in your life walk past me
Without acknowledging this man as G-O-D, I shot you faggot ass

[Verse 3: Fat Joe]
Now who the fuck you think you talking to, I pay dues I spray crews
Look I'm Joey Crack, motherfuckers be like he's bad news
Runnin this racket, from New York to Montego
Slaughtering people, bring a ton of keys from Puerto Rico
I'd rather be feared than loved because the fear lasts longer
These bitch-ass niggas know we stronger
Than these weaklings, seeking for respect that ain't there
Knuckleheads beware there's mad tension in the air
Tommy guns for fun shotties for block parties
While fresh lead heats up your insides like a fifth of Bacardi
Call the ambulance, this man's wet
Bullets cut him down from the root up just like a Gillette
Razor, which I keep hidden in my oral
Ready to spatter at any ad out that wants to quarrel
These feds want me for some tax evasion
Mad at the fact that somebody's getting lucci that's not caucasian
Bullets be blazing through these streets filled with torture
Joey Crack a.k.a. Keyser Soze

[Verse 4: Foxxy Brown]
Thug niggas give they minks to chinks to down
We sip drinks rockin' minks, flashing rings and things (What the deal)
Fronting hardcore deep inside the Jeep, mackin
Doing my thing fly nigga you a Scarface king
Bitches grab ya ta-ta's, get them niggas for they chedda
Fuck it, Gucci sweaters and Armani leathers
Flossing rocks like the size of Fort Knox
Four carats, the ice rocks, pussy banging like Versace locs pops
Want ta the creep, on the light raw ass cheeks
I'm sexing raw dog without protection, diseaese infested
Italiano got the Lucciano
I gets down fucking with Brown Fox extra keys to the drop
Boo I'm Jingling Baby
I got crazy Dominicans who pay me to lay low, I play slow
Roll with The Firm, Mafiaso crime king pin
It all real nigga what tha deal, I shot you

[Verse 5: LL Cool J]
What the fuck, I thought I conquered the whole world
Crushed Moe Dee, Hammer and Ice-T's girl
But still, niggas want to instigate shit
I'll battle any nigga in tha rap game quick
Name the spot, I make it hot for you bitches
Female rappers too, I don't give a fuck boo
Word, I'm here to crush all my peers
Rhymes of the month in The Source for twenty years
Niggas scared, I'm detrimental to your mental state
I use my presidential Rolex to be the bait
Niggas fight, Glock cocked ya temple gets fucked
MC's, that fuck with LL they gets bucked
That's real, what's up with that I Shot Ya deal
Light shit, niggas slip now how the bullet feel
New York appeal, in L.A. they gang bang
But if you touch a mic your motherfuckin ass hang
That's facts, niggas don't recieve no type of slack
Cause if they do, they ass is always runnin back
Not this time, but next time I'mma name names
LL, shitting from on top of the game, I shot you[Intro: Jim Jones]

One shot of that'll have the boys bring the coppers out
And we balling, foreign toys is what we hopping out
My feary side, where we ride

So twist your fingers up and bang motherfucker bang
Get your money up, this cane is what we fucking slang
And 9 trey is what I fucking claim
It's Dipset Cap, the Don of the Byrdgang

[Snoop Dogg]
They call the D-O-Dub, wasn't really tripping cause
Twenty-one, twenty Crips and all of us is cripping cuz
We from a different street all got that different heat
But when we move the Macs for Game we on the same beat
So if you fuck with Blood then you fuck with us
And we ain't busting duds cause we busting slugs
We sure to stay in touch and clean your mess up
And if you from the West Coast, my nigga, W-w-w-w-westside

[Nas]
Game got at me about the remix, it's an honor my nigga
I made rap, one blood, that say I'm signing with Jigga
I got rappers getting mad at me
I got these new jack rappers trying to clap at me
I got these corny wannabe diss-song kings on the radio
Talking bout how they gon' spray and take me away
But I'm the true living legend
I'm not to be questioned
Have your whole hood holler shit about my progression

[T.I.]
You knowing my attitude shitty only a buck fifty
So I keep the Smitty's with me shit how many with me

With two two's you can call me Quick Draw McGraw
Bitch I'mma cut that fool, better call the law
I start spraying make fuck nigga fall and crawl
I press play like Puff, no pause at all
Chopping holes in all the walls that's all they saw

[The Game]
Hip-hop ain't dead it just took a couple shots
I bring it back to life give it a couple shocks
The King's coming no, I'm not Jay-Z
Too many niggas hate me but they scared to face me
This ain't a movie dog, no not Waist Deep
I'm not an actor but I'll show your bitch big meat
She giving one blood, one love on dubs
A hundred forty thousand the first week

[Fat Joe]
All these niggas wanna front trill with them stiff faces
Till them niggas lying still up in stiff cases
Within styrofoam and embalming fluid
I been gone too long and I'm down to lose it
Somebody go and get this nigga a pine box
And I ain't just talking about a measly nine shots
Yeah I'm chopper-happy and my wrist loose
Call me Goldie I'll smack your bitch too

[Lil' Wayne]
504 gangsta New Orleans soldier
Banging underwater fuck around and soak you
Louisiana gunner, I'm bout my holster
And if you getting greasy I'm an ulcer
I'm bicking back being bool on the Eastside
Of New Orleans where the Bloods at the B-Hive
Ain't nothing sweet unless it's Presidential
That is where I sleep now give me my key

[N.O.R.E.]
New York get the blood money, dirty cash still sweet
We with Black Wall Street by the swapmeet with heat
Def Jam they gonna flop him and Reggaeton ain't hot in the building no more
It's ok I get it popping
Back to the forest trees for deep, these little me's
Who took believers an opportunity to breathe
And you ain't gotta go overseas to see Iraq shit
You can come to LeFrak Queens and get jacked quick

[Jadakiss and Styles P]
One Blood we used to the spilling
Came from the hood so we used to the killing
Used to the Black males making cracksales in the building
How else you get the Benz with the suede on the ceiling
Blood in, Blood out
Me and homie back to back
Both loaded working we about to pitch a shut out
I'm New York's king I'm New York's hardest nigga
Anything in between's a motherfucking target nigga
D-B-L-O-C-K, he spray
The hawk'll find a nice home right where your cheeks stay
We got a mean team hip-Hop dream team
Them boys is only in the projects on green screen
Yeah no security, I'll put you on the respirator
I'm the bomb I'm the motherfucking detonator
One dutch, one bud, one burner, one slug
Want a couple casualties, but we'll settle for just one blood

[Fabolous]
What it look like all I say at most
Shooters waiting on the word just say it Los
I let these niggas live yes I saw em pull the plug
Have them goons pulling gloves, leave the room full of slugs
Catch me trafficking on maroon colored dubs
Couple Africans with balloons full of drugs
If they like me tell em line up
While I sit behind team point em out like a line up

[Juelz Santana]
Mic check, one two, one two check
I'm strapped, you strapped let's play two-on-two
Let's go you're eyeing us in the iron bus, boom
Leak you, two liters of red juice, Hawaiian Punch
So what you boys gon do to me, I'm born street
Your life's sweet, MTV's Laguna Beach
Mama told me not to play with fire but
She never told me I would grow to be a lighter

[Rick Ross]
One love to the gangs but I'm in the thangs
Save the colors for the cars see we kill for the fame
The boss made it yeah, we floss flagrant
Shame how I lost your life savings up in Las Vegas
I'm a heavy better, I'm a heavy seller
Keep white in the office call it Jerry Heller
Letting off a hundred rounds let the barrel pick
And we gon sit here and wait for the derelicts

[Twista]
Bitch Chi got Lords and Gangsters show me where them niggas at

[Daz]

Glock holding on the hip rolling with two clips
Got two tiny locos ready to take trips
Shake and make trips high stakes to take grips

They hold cards down nigga like spades and pinochle
West coast gang bang, riders erasing em
Got funny niggas raising up and riders replacing em, cuz

[Daz Dillinger]
Draped in blue, notorious gangsta crew
RIP for niggas who don't stay true
Deep down in the crevices see the jets veteran
Dwelling in the land of the gang bang profession
I'm legendary yes, yes a Westcoaster
Throwing up two C's with two guns in my holster
I'm from Long Beach City a crip next to Compton
Down with my nigga Game if you niggas want problems
From the streets to the suites anywhere we can meet
Del Amo to Compton, Slauson Swap Meet
Worldwide get swept away by the tide
By Gs and BGs, OGs it's time to ride

[WC]
Who the rider, looter through the gutter man
Trued up in them Carolina blue Hurricanes
From the Westside striving to dead em
Where them killers throw that third letter up
Like Raymond Washington and Tookie Williams
Blue jeans, blue strings, blowing blueberry green
Cadillac on blue Ds and a blue tee
Money thick as blue cheese chunking up the dub
What the West be without Snoop and Dub C and one Blood

[E-40]
The Bay Area fuckers we pop em
Open you up if you got a problem
Up top born in Cali-forn-ia
Clean your clock open your can of tuna
Make a choice either it's hell or it's heaven
Get your chest layed out with the FM 57
This ain't nothing to do with nobody
But in the Yay there ain't nothing to do but catch bodies

[Bun B]
I'm coming straight outta PAT like Compton in all black
But when we say what it do they never say holla back
Bun B the OG like '95 Air Max
Neon green outta Flight Club offa Fairfax
Ask The Hundreds, it's doable I done done it
At the summit of rap and I'm watching you haters plummet
Run to it or run from it to Bun it don't differ
Wipe the streets with you like you a swiffer as a gifter one blood

[Chamillionaire]
I'm the realest youngster thats breathing and I don't gotta give a reason
Chamillionaire a millionaire, y'all competing to be competing
My purpose is to get the cheese and as a purpose that should defeating
So shut your mouth, have a seat and be quiet till I finish eating
My label tells me I'm greedy, hogging all the room on your tv
Like Eric they think its Eazy, but it isn't easy believe me
Need to make a room in B.E. television if you wanna be me
Game said he made room for Jeezy, I had to make room for me, G

[Slim Thug]
It's one Blood if you Blood or Cuz
From that number one Thug it's still one love
I rep my blue boy team but I do it for green
I do it for my folks Vice Lords and Kings
All the trappers future rappers standing out on the blocks
Tryna get up out the hood man and stack em a knot
Put your sets in the air scream fuck the cops
We gon rep for the hood man like it or not

[Young Dro]
My feed mashable, murders are catastrophical
Cars is improbable I'm overcoming obstacles
Trapping I made it logical my topic is impossible
I got a partner named Shoe Strang cause shorty real crossable
Shark meat to Pappadeaux, cars be tropical
All guns choppable all blocks are mobbable
I'm unstoppable my calico is toxable
Lyrically diabolical, cushion is not ???

[The Clipse]
Red rum, red rum such power in the tongue
Never in the wildest was he talking to them
Style on niggas but feel it to the numb
Japanese thread brought flavor to these bums
Consider me the savior, look what the Lord gave you
My celebrated presence like the return of Rayful
Frolic in the snow so playful
And reviving the track like we flowing through jumper cables
What duo you know get XXL kudos while copping off Coolio
Classic shit we mastered this left for dead, I'm back
I'm Lazarus

[Ja Rule]
Nigga, one Crip, one Blood
LA, New York
The Game, the Rule, one love guns up
Hands down, can't touch the flow is a bit much
The style wanna keep up
I'd advise you to speed up
With money moving like coke these days gotta re-up
G up, cop some heaters and dare a nigga to act up
You see us in dual seaters and throw it up
It's all hood niggas rep your sets if your Cuz or Blood
Niggas, we all bleed
These niggas can't breathe
Only because the guns are drawn and aimed to part
Niggas that got bullets with names on them
Want em, come get em niggas y'all know where to get at me
Look at me now pass me maybe you can be half me
You bastards, I'm laughing bullets sticking in family
Who sadly gets torn between one Crip and one Blood
Y'all niggas know me, yeah[Intro: DJ Khaled & T-Pain]
I’m for real about this shit, this the remix (welcome to my hood) let’s go, remix, remix, remix
(Where ya hood at, where ya hood at, where ya hood at)

[Hook: T-Pain]
Welcome to my hood
Everybody know everybody and if I got it everybody got it, ugh
Welcome to my hood
Look at all these old school Chevys, 24′s so you know we roll heavy (YMCMB)
Welcome to my hood
Where they gettin fly like a G6, and everybody know this is the remix
Welcome to my hood
Them boys will put you down on yo knees (woop, woop) that’s the sound of the police in my hood

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Everybody on the corner with the work slangin & bangin in front of that liquor store
Blowin money cause I live life fast with this bottle full of yak I’m a sip it slow
Singles double when triple beams take over
Now holla cause they Impalas got extreme makeovers
Couches covered in plastic, babies all in the street now
Wear the wrong color and catch a Rodney King beatdown
Kids hit with switches, mamas is quotin’ scriptures
While Luda's getting head, more gums than baby pictures
Cock my 40 Glock and my partna just bought a replica
Now Asians sayin they don’t keep no cash in they register (hurry up and buy)
We run from red & blue lights to get that green
But whoever got that white is winning like Charlie Sheen

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
Teddy pain, teddy pain, bad man, bad man
Mixed shots, boom boom boom boom boom bang
Man we the best never the less, you know we get it hot
Fire flame flame, fire fire flame
Put me on the track and I’m a really let a muthafucka feel it, when I do it, how I do it, what I do
If a nigga really wanna test (come and test), you can bet that I’m a eat em all day (fuck food)
850 what I represent, Tallahome Florida president
Me & DJ Khaled got these haters lookin hesitant
So keep all that wackness out my ear, (phew phew) that’s the sound of your career in my hood

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
I hope you niggas got your ringside seats, cause it’s whoopass season
Comin to a hood near you, everybody know what happen when you see me comin (Back up!)
I be hurdling & gotcha reguritating & murdering everything gun shots bah bah bah bah bah bah bah
Ya’ll know what it is, I’m coming to get it & others are blocking
I’m runnin the hood and nothin can top it
You can Google it and you can search it
On how a nigga come and unlock it, impossible to stop it
More fire, thunder, pain, I go and heed the villain, he’s adrenaline poppin
Need a medical situation because the way I’m fuckin everything until I’m peepin it
Why you tryna do what you already know that I’m the king with it
And, you don’t wanna come behind me with it bro
Uggh, I killed this shit I ain’t gotta rhyme no more

[Verse 4: Twista]
Welcome to my hood where poor members of faculty backin me
If you ever try attackin me, that could be when I eat em
Especially when I beat em, when they see a bunch of killas and hustlas on the side of me
I’m an anomoly to em, put em on crutches
We’ll sock ya lip first for you touch us, he one that’s kickin our brothas
Much as I smoke the duchess and model chicks that cut us
And muthafuckas that love us, their enemies wanna touch us
I’m a spit a flow as if it was a sin, then the gangstas are restin forever
See a solid 4, then I’m a put it on the fin
Then you know to never test, it’ll be a category F5
Handle military with automatic weapon so let’s ride
Love to the honeys, and everybody that runnin the north
And they whole city from the westside

[Verse 5: Mavado:]
Welcome to the gully where we not take bad up
Big Spliff in my hand and Hennessy in my cup
You see the gal them we have up is like some angel adopt, them fat and grab up
You hear me when you pass the gate written at the entrance violate
A straight death sentence to live you must be great
To be a snake know repentance
We coming at you with vengeance

[Verse 6: DJ Khaled:]
Never slippin', I’m ballin
Puff keep on callin
I don’t see none of you pussies, fuck that shit you be talkin
Rep Miami the ghettos (Dade County), every hood and the projects
And when I drop off my singles, I’m droppin one of my targets
Lord forgive me for my sins, I gave you hits
I gave you “All I Do Is Win“, I live this shit
And, we the best, it’s no pretend
I touch a million, throwin hundreds in this bitch

[Verse 7: Birdman:]
Real real nigga numba 1, hustle fly with my son
I come from uptown, G5 tommy gun
Red flag everyday, hundred mil ready to spray
Swagged out nigga, Bugatti with the paper plate
Blowin on some good nigga, feelin good nigga
Stunna island, Me & Khaled on the wood nigga
You understand, shinin like I know we should
Birdman YMCMB we good nigga

[Verse 8: Ace Hood]
*Broward!* Ace Hood in this bitch ho, kickin down in yo front door
Knock knock, you hear the Glock cock and that thing pop on the 4 4
Posted up in that same block, I’m in the drop top with that bank roll
Young nigga, I’m out here
Can’t name a place I can’t go
Ridin round with my 50 grand
And they wonder what do that safe hold
Middle finga them feds and that’s why I pledge a part of my G code
And fuck them prosecutors, hustla connoisseur
It’s we the best forever, make sure you spread the rumor bitch

[Verse 9: Fat Joe:]
Good coke, hard ride stashes in the bodyshop
Only way to break them bricks down is karate chops
Niggas gettin left right in front of the marble precinct
Leave em like them Jordans, red dot leakin
I’m 15 when I first startin coppin pies
You 46 just turnin blood, stop it 5
It’s like the only way to make it is supplyin things
Hoop dreams dunkin over cars, let the choir sing

[Verse 10: Game:]
It’s that black raw, black dawg pullin up on that black home
Compton that’s my backyard, that’s where I used to get them sacks off
But, now I got platinum plaques in the back of the 'Bach
And I’m back with Dre again, Aftermath
We the best, Me & Khaled, Dre & Em
Detox, RED, that’s back to the back
Step in the club with my hat to the back
Nigga I’m so hood even tho I’m livin good
Niggas still in VIP strapped with a gat
Drop a couple stacks then it's back to the trap
Couple hoes in the back, red wheels on the lac
Red rum, if you try it niggas (Westside) throw it up now

[Verse 11: Jadakiss:]
They knockin packs off, they lettin gats off
Medicate, benefit cards scratch off’s
Savin every dime, tryna choke a quarter
And they ain’t sellin crack, they sellin coke & water
Smokin or ya snortin, they coppin all the Jordans
Nothins more important, steal em if you can’t afford em
I’m gettin to the money, I need another comma
Some of em love the drama, more than they love they mama

[Verse 12: Bun B:]
Welcome to the land of the trill, where everybody walkin with they hand on they steel
And, a model is a supply & demand any will
You went outta line with the wrong man then get killed
When ya damned if you will & damned if you won’t
Lotta dudes sayin that they can but they don’t
Lotta boys sayin that they G’s and they ain’t
Mess around, get laid down in the paint
Better do what you say, and say what you do
For I come around ya hood, broad day with the crew
They got them fists, AR’s, AK’s and them twos
And they will gladiate all day, what it do
R.I.P. to the trillest that did it, to my G’s on lockdown
Stick with it, think I’m a stop reppin PAT, forget it

[Verse 13: Waka Flocka Flame:]
Welcome to Clayton county, my house got surrounded
Enemies tryna drown me, but my hood still around me
Rookie of the year, no freshman cover
Shawty 16 years old, with 4 baby mothers
First rapper ever to jump off the stage on BET
And, since Pac go to Hollywood to keep it street
First Woo to put T. Rodgers on the TV
Everyday it’s a party on Grove street

[Outro: DJ Khaled - talking]
‘We The Best Forever’, June 28th. It's gon' be a hot summer[Verse 1: Mad Lion]
Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why
Why does a DJ test and he end up die
I know, I know, I know, I can't explain
Pack up a shot just blow dem brain
Who are the man with the gun inna his hand
Step up on the scene like Captain Caveman
You want the music everybody scream louder
Lick bare shot and smell the gun powder

[Verse 2: Doug E. Fresh]
On and on and on and on...
Yo, freestyle flow to make the crowd just go
The old to the new, the new to the old
{Beatbox} The rhythm be working up on me
The crowd be jumping up for me, the people are waiting up on me
To enter the stage in the rage, Mad Lion's out the cage
Now it's time for me to engage, uhh
And bear witness, the lyrical fitness
The jumps, the dives, the leaps, are you getting this?
Next to step up, microphone check up
KRS-ONE, so come and get your wreck up

[Verse 3: KRS-ONE]
Our mother who art in Heaven number seven is the weapon
With the Goddess I'm stepping lyrically I'm never begging, you know
I'm the difference between indo and oregano
Imagine how fresh I am now, I made these lyrics up a year ago
So report back it was fat, fit, all that, quick, pump that, drop the S-hit
I'm lyrically physically fit
Catch me bugging on the mic, every day and every night
Every hour, every second, man it don't stop, get it, get it
Yes, admit it when I'm way up in it
You can't hide cause my radar's going bibip bibip bibip
I reside in the watchtower watching MCs land
Your career will be as short as my part in "Who's The Man"
Goddamn I'm the pinnacle, yes the metaphysical
Come to you as the rap god of lyrical syllables
Fall to your knees, bring fruit, ask advice
Put your rhymes on the altar, burn them as a sacrifice
The aroma reaches up to my nostril
I get hostile, your lyrics are stiff like David Koppel
Yes Premier rocks the track on time
KRS-ONE with off of the top of the head rhyme
Yeah Fat Joe, you know you got a flow
My man Doug E Fresh down with the one called KRS
We got the mad MCs up in the D&D
I'm out, G

[Verse 4: Fat Joe]
Yeah!
Motherfuckers know who's the best
If it ain't Fat Joe then it must be Lord Finesse
Think not, then show what you got
But don't grab this mic, the shit's too hot
I'm the born killer, nigga from the Bronx
Rappers talk shit but there's really no comp
Bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing
Yeah, so Smif-n-Wessun if you're down with me
Represent one time on the M-I-C

[Verse 5: Smif-n-Wessun]
Mr. Ripper, get your gear and prepare for war
Mr. Vickster, you ain't gotta tell me no more
Cause what I see, on the daily
Deals with reality, so come follow we on this journey
Through Brooklyn where the crooks dwell in the projects overlooking
In the form of the streets, you know them well
Bet your ass this grass is greener
Than a 20 sack of sensimila brought straight from Medina
You know the vibe when Smif-n-Wessun twist up the Thai
Peace to my people in the Ville, peace to my heads in the Stuy
We do or die, we test your stamina
So any challenger we pass the motherfucker off to the Damaja

[Verse 6: Jeru the Damaja]
Super scientifical madness
My status is the baddest every time I bless the apparatus
You wish to take me out, so you study
Meanwhile my clothes, mics and foes are left bloody
Cruddy, filthy from the ground on up
When I plan my attack I doubt that you're ready
Rain on competition like razor sharp confetti
Kung Fu techniques from the perverted monastery
Sifu Ru manipulates the microphone
And rhymes like bullets penetrate your zone
See we bring more drama than Kevin Costner
No I'm not Jamaican but yes I'm a Rasta[From The 300 Movie]
This is where we fight
This is where they die
On the shields boys

[Fat Joe talking]
Coca. I'm in the greatest shape of my life! 300 Brolic nigga. Who wanna fight? (Who who who who) Who wanna fuck around with the don right now, nigga? (Who who who who who) BX TS nigga squadians Arm up!

[Singing]:

Just when you thought it was

Just when you thought it was
Safe to turn the corner I

Crack man, crack man
Playin with the gat then
Hear that? brat ta tat ta tat ta like a song
Taurus Raging Bull, about the size of my arm
See the size of the charm make your wife leave your arm
That's right, I fight, I done been in brawls
I done did some things that made some killers shit they drawers
I done been on boats in Columbia shipping raw and
I done ripped up plenty of stages with Biggie Smalls
Oh shit, wait a minute, I done did it all
Poor righteous teacher I'm featured on final call
Hustle I'm a Laker man yes yes y'all
And Pun already told you that we ready for war
Quit playing, hit mayne, blood stains on the wall
Shit mayne, his brains, your remains on the floor

"Where are you?" "Hey, there you are!"
"How does it feel to know you only have a few more seconds left to live?"
*gunshot*

("Big L" - Cut and scratched)

[Big L]
I stay jeweled up, pockets swelled up from banks I held up
Plenty bitch-ass niggas Big L stuck
I never catch cold feet when I hold heat
We roll deep in a triple black dark tinted old jeep
I catch a fag three o'clock in the morn
On the block all alone and put a Glock to his dome
Tell him, "Give it up quick, you nitwit, don't try to get slick
Or I'm a let this four-fifth spit and leave your shit split"
Grip, it ain't nothing decent about me
A true thug for real, you can ask the precinct about me
A rap junkie, don't try to play me like some flunky
Jewels be chunky, pockets lumpy, attitude grumpy
Mad niggas be fronting a lot
Popping mad shit, tryna be something they not
Your faggot ass better stick to dancing, don't even look at me
I might break your jaw just for glancing, that's right
In '97 Harlem kids is blowing
And we don't trick, we'll let a bitch starve till her ribs are showing

("Lord Finesse" - Cut and scratched)

[Lord Finesse]
Heated divine mastermind that turn nickels to dimes
The authentic genuine that's out to shine
The cool cat, the true mack, the smooth raps
Chickens be like, "Who that?" I be doing my thing, kid (True dat)
Forget fronting, I'm beyond that, I roll with brothers ready for combat
All for eye-to-eye contact
With skills, G, yo it's ill see, for real B
Ain't no barbecue, niggas better stop tryna grill me
Huh, sent that style to the essence
Got niggas stressing my style, pull like fluorescents
No question, tough type to clutch mics
The positive upright, I'm the "I don't give a fuck" type
Expose the facts, you know the haps
Could go to laugh astrological, like the signs in the Zodiac
Your rap crew out the stack loop, word up
My style's tighter than a fat bitch in a cat suit
Suprise G, it's not wise see to size me
When I operate, it's Smooth Sailing like Ron Isely
Gotta do my thing, word up (Beg ya pardon?)
Time to bounce, gotta skate like Tonya Harding

("A.G." - Cut and scratched)

[A.G.]
Yo I'm the cleverest top ten terrorist
Chickens ever diss they become featherless
Hate derelicts, certified gold medallist
You play fly cause I'm the most high like Everest
Look at all these fakes, musically you imitate the Crates
Won't succeed moving at full speed with no brakes
Like Jake, watch me take your entourage
Can't see me, I'm camoflauge and besides, I'm God
Mad hard like the S.A.T. who have shorties
Caught up in the mental, watch her bless A.G
Evidently you still don't know because you tempt me
Thought you was the boss when your fat thoughts were empty
Not Fat Joey Crack but still Jealous One's Envy
Who sent me? D.I.T.C., good and plenty
Like the doctor, smoke a Spike Joint and watch "Clockers"
Get rude like Shabba, make moves behind my blockers
Crazy sickness, you want the pure, you'd better pick this
Bitches can't get this, faggots remain dickless

("Fat Joe" - Cut and scratched)

[Fat Joe]
Before we get started, let's talk about these coward-hearted
MC's that claim to be true O.G.'s
And war specialists forever bust your guns on the sack of shit
But when the beef come, get on the ___ before I protest your licks
You know the deal, I come with nothing but the real
Certified pejente, recognize mi gente
Whether East Coast or West Coast, I'll make 'em all strip naked Bitch niggas will never get respected
Joey Green bagging devils up in Bowling Green for all is clean
Cock the 9 soon as I seen his Rolie gleam
You know the team, never giving a fuck
Laying thick in the cut, get your shit laced up
What the fuck!

("Diamond D" - Cut and scratched)

[Diamond]
Yo I'm flipping on niggas like treys of crack
My raps react on your cardiac like a heart attack
Some niggas front for stunts
Who want to take a puff of the blunt and play a nigga like a chump
But I don't play that shit with no chicks
Sucking the next nigga's dick, moving bricks
I'm too slick for you high school dropouts
You got knocked and tried to cop out
Couldn't fight when the kids pulled the mop out
And wails you out, writing home saying, "Bail me out"
Little small time, fucked up when you called mine
D Squared, one of the Greatest of All Times

[Outro: Diamond D]
Yeah, D.I.T.C. representing for the '97, word life[Intro]
Darkside!
You know it mean more to me when a nigga really live them lyrics you know!
Yeah! I mean like when I listen to a nigga I be like yeah I remember
Uh-Hah! I don't really remember them niggas, puttin it down like that

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
Wonder why the flow retarded
Cause the shit we author authentic
More realer than you fake niggas pretendin'
Uh! Late night long drives our main agenda
Get money fuck every bitch before we end up
Dead in the pine box make sure it's a hundred thousand
I grew up in public housin', boilin' crack in water fountains
Youngin on the park bench fantasizin'
Same spot he got shot and they can't revive him
Darkside is a tail of addictions
Turn your moms into a fiend cause you addicted to pitchin'
Uh! You gotta get the cuban three kilos
Giovanci the heat's on me
Got knocked turned quiet bet ya sing off key
Nah man I stay Cool like D.R.E
Living rooms with swimming pools filled with P.Y.T.'s
Fresh pair of J's and some PRPS you know

[Interlude]
Yeah! Uh!

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
Just me and my bitch, in the two seater
Mink floor in the wind, that'll move PETA
Get me a pot and a stove and I could move pieces
Thirty six of them o's I bought a Mona Lisa
Got more white chicks than a sorority house
While Fox News quick to point minorities out
I got a Mexicana chick, bad Dominicana
Pointed her out the crowd and her son's a punta cana
Put her in some pumps and designer Chanels
She got a pussy wet enough to douse the fires in hell
Got the iron on my seat and I pull up blastin'
9th Wonder on the beat and it's a fuckin' classic

[Outro]
Uh! Yeah! I wanna shoutout my brother Brent T.A.T
Bio, Nice and B.G. Shoutout to Shane 125th!
Uh! Coke too I see you, forever king![Verse 1 - Lil Wayne]
Young desperado, straight out the grotto
I'm so bad, my shadow chooses not to follow
Little nigga, but see me as a fuckin' rhino
Lil Weezy hit this bitch like Rocky Marciano
It's a drought ain't it? How the fuck would I know?
Nigga, I've been getting my share in like Sonny Bono
I ran the streets... check my bio
I started high with two O's just like Ohio
I'm fuckin' nuts; cashews
But I'm so DC like fat shoes
I skate away, like "Later dudes"
Never get caught, baby, I'm mashed potato smooth
And just when it stopped, I made it move
Respect me nigga I'm a dog; no Asian food
I wet up the party, so have a bathin' suit
And daisy dukes you bitch ass nigga

[Hook - Lil Wayne]
Keep talking that shit that you talking
And we gone have to get into some gangsta shit
My nigga... keep talking that shit that you talking
And we gone have to get into some gangsta shit
My nigga... Cause you ain't really even 'bout all that
You ain't really even 'bout all that
And don't you forget.. I know ya, you ain't 'bout all that
You ain't never been about all that... fall back

[Verse 2 - Fat Joe]
Niggas must want Joey to lean on 'em
Flash the binky, splash his dreams on 'em
Let 'em sleep on it, it's nothing to Crack
Lay the murder game down back to hustlin' packs
Yeah Weezy homie's got your back, whether raps or macks
Either way they both spit like BRRRRAT!
Nigga... them muhfuckas is broke like them levees
And we done sold so much dope ain't shit you tell me
Nigga... how you want it huh coke or dog food?
My shit'll have you running naked like an old school
And yeah we 'bout it 'bout it, and you ain't ridin' on me
Unless ya got a whole fuckin' suicidal army
And I'm a rider homie, and you can find it on me
That 40 cal'll get your shirt picture ironed on it
This shit is funny to me
All these niggas wanting war but they runnin' from me... Crack!

[Hook - Lil Wayne]

[Verse 3 - Birdman]
I had 'em as lil' niggas, raised 'em 'round real niggas
Poppin' bottles fuckin' with them bitches nigga
Made money to the ceiling, me and my young nigga chilling
I'm in the streets, hustling, getting money nigga
Changed all my new shoes nigga, got some new tools
Nigga got some more jewels, we was getting money
And ain't nothing ever changed, still doing the thang
Still getting money, still spending change
We hustling from Sunday to Sunday
And we grinding everyday like the money ain't coming
Nigga... yeah we riding woodgrains and minks
Got the dope in the Hummer cold case for that thing
I hate the law for what they done did they broke in niggas cribs
Wish I woulda caught 'em Idda split they fuckin' wig
3rd Ward let me claim my fame
I put it down, Uptown, I'mma do my thang believe that

[Hook - Lil Wayne][Hook: T-Pain]
All I do is win, win, win, no matter what
Got money on my mind I can never get enough
Whenever me and Khaled do the remix everybody's hands go up
And they stay there
And they stay yea
And they stay there
Up, down, up, down, up, down
Cause all I do is win, win, win
And if you going in put your hands in the air make em stay there

[Verse 1: DJ Khaled]
Sittin' on the top floor, what you think I'm hot for
Every summer drop more, hits to make my stock go, up
Them hands go, up; them fans go, up
I'm number one in this bitch and I'ma, stay there
We the best of the best, grind while you haters just sleep
I'm yellin' "free Weezy", I rep the heart of the streets
Who hotter than me, I'm wearin' the crown
We can't stop, won't stop; go hate on me now

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I could never get enough when it come to gettin' fetti
Niggas ain't ready for my Ferrari Scaglietti
Mario Andretti, money comin' fast
My honeycomb hideout is made of all glass
I could never be a racist, wake up every morning just to count white faces
Neo in the Matrix, glorious as Morpheus
Employed all warriors, I'm mean as a scorpion, Dr. Kevorkian

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Everytime I come you gotta know a nigga comin'
Get a lot of money when I'm in the buildin'
And I come and say there ain't [motherfuck ?] nobody better, better, better, better!
Uh-huh, Okay
Niggas know I got you when I hit you with the pitter-patter
Whenever they see me then you hear a lot of chitter-chatter
Niggas know there ain't nobody better, better, better, better!
I watch a lot of niggas when I'm in the cut
So sick when I come and hit 'em in the gut
You will crown me king (no matter what!)
(Kill 'em!)
Ok, let's shine my friend
Get up on my grind again
Some niggas will be happy that I chose to rhyme with them cause

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Diddy]
Her heart racing like she snort cocaine
I got a billion reasons you should know my whole name
Got the most paper Mr. New York Times
I'm a natural born winner nigga New York mines
Everybody getting money but I cop the first six
Now I run the game so I toss the first pitch
Yea, I'll let you wife her but she still my first bitch
If it's less then nine digits nigga, that ain't fuckin' rich mother fucker

[Verse 5: Nicki Minaj]
Ayo, all I do is win, ain't that the reason that you really mad
Undisputed hailing all the way from Trinidad
I ain't mad ma, see you on your bummy swag
I'm in that money green Jag, lot of money bags
I told Khaled you the best but I'm the bestest
Better run for cover if your name is on my checklist
You could talk slick, all the way down to the welfare
Ask the IRS bitch, I'm paying for your health care

[Verse 6: Fabolous]
I'ma make this here official, Let me clear some issues
First off I am not for Britney Spears initials
Thats no B-S, at your re-quest
Lean back you and your crew, Fat Joe, T-S
Yea it's Young Funeral, all black on me
So act like summers over and fall back homey
Winnin' is all I do, I'll answer all of you
But y'all ain't sayin' shit, like prank callers do

[Hook]

[Verse 7: Jadakiss]
It's already proven, I got them birds movin'
All I do is win, I'm allergic to losin'
Yellow gold cuban, nine mil Ruger
I'll show you what to do with em
Finish em, I'm through with em
They gon have to jump me, it's gon take a few of em
They don't want no problems, they might end up suing em
Disassociate yourself, have nothing to do with em
We already got a jet, we tryna get two of em

[Verse 8: Fat Joe]
Just blew trial, crack lobsters Little Italy
Your wife she a screamer yellin' slow down Joe, you killin' me
Beat her like a prize fight mommy I’m a rude boy
You just hit the Power Ball, everyday a new toy
Nigga it’s a stick up, a motherfuckin' robbery
I done did some things that have Haitian Jack proud of me
Ridin' through Harlem me and Jeezy pardon me
Puffy surfin' on the hood for niggas that keep doubtin' me

[Hook][Fat Joe]
Welcome to the world of Joe, flooded with thugs and hoes
Real niggas, drug dealers, with villas in the Strolls
Lexus and Rolls parked in twenty-car garages
Living the largest, with Oriental massages in garbage
Shit, I get down for mine
Terror Squad run things in any town you can find
New York, New York, big city of dreams
Where there's nothing but foreign cars, bitches, and triple beams
I fiend for cash, fat pieces of ass
Never giving a fuck, get your shit laced up
The corrupt crutas wake me up to new crimes
On news prime: gangster rapper goes nuts and wounds nine
Joey Crack's the rock, known for packing Macs and Glocks
Stay away from Little Puppet cause his ass is hot
Shot, in the middle of the street
Pretty boys don't sleep cause beauty is only skin deep

[Lord Finesse]
While you playing games, we claimin fame slaying dames
The aim is to make Mo' Money like Damon Wayans
You know our names, we don't play jokes
Niggas ain't feeling us? You ain't supposed to, that's for gay folks
You stay broke, we stay holding and stay rolling
Rap's Beethoven, exploding, my game's golden
Pockets swollen, we make the freaks stare
Roll with some chocolate grimey niggas, but ain't nothing sweet here
Keep clear, ah yeah so get stepping
Make hit records off of loops that's six seconds
No question the cash tipper, the ass whipper
Need a chick that can hang, fuck you broads that wear glass slippers
Bigger, city slicker, you cats follow me?
Finesse is among the stars like astrology
Greater knowledge, G, shit's wild, I flip styles
On the mile, let me pass it off like Chris Childs

[Fat Joe]
Yo it's all love, thug niggas and all of the above
Drug dealers, killer, niggas at the Player's Club
Young ladies, sisters, rump shaking bitches
Niggas on the Island rock 150 stitches (Repeat 2x)

[Big L]
Yo my cash flow don't get low, it just increase
And whoever tries to take mine will rest in peace
Keep a stone look, peace to every known crook
Not those who go to jail and can't hold they own and come home shook
So hold on and prepare to get rolled on
My crew robs every fag that walks through with gold
Cats who act rah rah will catch a jim star scar
Punks who fake the funk don't get far, pah
Me and my clan parlay sipping Grand Marnier
At a party at the bar is where we stand all day
In '97 I'm bubbling, no more stuggling
If I fall, it's back to selling drugs again and busting slugs in men
No doubt, you know what I'm about
The last slouch that walked through my block didn't make it out
Because I stuck that nigga, then I bucked that nigga
(I felt sorry for that kid) I didn't fuck that nigga

[A.G.]
We be the bomb, baby, indeed I smoke weed
Been ripping shit since the late 80's, so what you need?
Not scared to fall, that's why I rise and stand tall
And send y'all back to the wall like I'm Darryl Straw
The truth is, don't give a damn if you're ruthless
Make it happen, I look at platinum niggas like "Who's this?"
Woe the the bloody city, Babylon will
Die in its inequities, project overkill
See me in the future shining, gold with diamonds
A nigga been used to climbing, my whole life
That's a trademark, if it ain't rough, it ain't right
We bring the heat, all you do is bark, we bite
I'm authentic, and once I send it, it's unretrievable
Like nuclear missles, cause meant it, now it's time to lace this
Resort to the basics
Niggas get rushed just because, hush and don't say shit[Intro: Rico Love] + (Fat Joe)
Hello (Coca)
Aloha (Krillz-mania)
It's love (yeah)
Turn the lights on!

[Hook: Pleasure P]
I ain't gotta lie, so don't even trip
I'm super duper fly, you know that I'm the shit
220 on the dash, that forty on my hip
Throw up a bunch of cash, make them bitches do the splits
They say - hello, hello, hello - aloha
Because they know that I'm the shit
They say - hello, hello, hello - aloha
Aloha... because I'm so fly

[Fat Joe]
Yeah, yo
I'm "Supa Dupa Fly," you can call me Missy's boo
Pull up in the SLR, have all the mamis sick of you
All them college credits, you can throw them things away
You ain't gon' be needin a job, you fuckin with Jose
Hey~! Hello, hello, aloha, I go hard
I'm so fly, we so hot, they so not - sheeeeit
Them other niggas is lame
Seent you on the sidelines, time to put you in the game
Coca be the name, party's up in Diddy's house
Pushed her through the Bronx just to show her what the city 'bout
Touched a couple blocks, got the dough and skate off
And just like Bernie, me and my baby Madoff
Hello!

[Hook]

[Rico Love]
Try to play me short, I'mma fuck around and fade a bitch
Fresh up off the porch on that Kool-Aid and them tater chips
Don't fuck with lames, cause they be on that hater shit
If you got a problem with me go ahead, say that shit
I'm scuba divin in Jamaica trick
Put the mic down, I'm on that Anita Baker shit
Or you could find me on the charts
Or up in St. Barts racing European cars
Screamin fuck the law and my baby momma raw
And she my baby momma cause them other bitches flaw
Aww! I'm what them other bitches call
A motherfuckin pimp, it's pimpin when I'm involved
Hello!

[Hook]

[Fat Joe]
Now tell me why these haters wanna see the end of Joe?
Honestly, I'm runnin out of ways to spend my dough
I'm burnin down the stores, I'm such a shopaholic
What'cha know it ain't trickin if you really got it
Louis scarfs, Louis frames, Louis trunks
Louis boxers, got all the Louis she wants, yeah~!
And you ain't got nuttin for us
Millions on the tourin and the crib ain't got a mortgage
Yes I'm the rain man, must I remind you?
Throw it in the air, watch her spread it like the swine flu
Ha ha! They say Joey on some other shit
And if that bitch start actin up, I go and grab my other bitch

[Hook][Intro: French Montana]
Sometimes you have to take it a day at a time
You know when you hear that Haaaaa

[Hook: Tiara Thomas & French Montana]
Just another day livin in the hood
Just another day around the way
Livin' good today
I hear the (gun shot), but I'm here to stay
Just another day livin' in the hood
Just another day in the hood
Didn't have to use the K today
Made it through another day

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
In my hood everyday niggas get locked down
Best friends hit on your girl and get 'em knocked down
Teachers tell you quick, you niggas'll never be shit
Dropped so much coke in the water, could make the sea sick
All I hear is sirens and sounds of guns blastin'
A little girl went missin' but ain't nobody askin'
My nigga Lil Troy hit the bank said he need cash
Seen him on the news I guess he forgot the ski mask
Strippers and celebrities, Instagram's a lick
Niggas rantin bout gay, cause ignorance is bliss
Shorty changin' food stamps just to get high
Listenin' to Stevie, "Ribbon in the Sky"
Homie reminiscin', I'm keepin' him in my prayers
Cause Joe crack cares, even if no one else cares
See me on the screen but I'm still the same G
They thought I'd never see outside of 5V

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Welcome home my nigga Joe Crack
Bust a bottle of that black shit lets go
New seven series charcoal gray Bimmer
Joe Crack, Dope Boy, nigga Don Cartegena
All the sixes we collect, bitches we could sex
Phone still tapped so it's best to send a text
Go and do a bid back home just like a king
Bucket full of crab, money bags that we seen
From Rikers to Fisher Isle, digits to digits pilin'
New Wraith with soft plates, long as the bitches smilin'
Ciroc boy, AP on the rocks
New Sunseeker, four mill on a yacht
I came from the mud, Def Jam the new plug
Five gold joints and still gets no love
I walk the same block, rode the same trains
We fucked the same bitches, whipped the same cane
(Boss!)

[Hook][Chorus: Chris Brown]
Don't you be holding back your love
Don't you be holding back
Don't you be holding back your love
Don't you be holding back
Cause in the end girl you're gonna want another round, another round
Girl you're gonna want another round, another round
I used to want you, and her and her and her and you and her and her
I used to want you, and her and her and her, all I want, all I want

[Post-Chorus: Fat Joe]
Shawty got a mean walk, a mean shoe game
Bitch badder than any bitch that you name
I'm talking Janet, maybe Kim K
I heard Rihanna, she like it kinky, come on

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
Quit playing girl you know that you want it
I can tell just by the way you push it out and flaunt it you bad
Something like Dirty Diana, body dope as heroin
And the sex off the handle
Your ex couldn't beat it, I hit it like a free throw
And since I lost some weight you say I got a big ego
It's too strong, you said the drive stick
Well baby just peel off
Loving how it lasts long, leave the sheets gushy
Fuck you with the mask on, Halloween pussy
Your body shivers and troubles with each and every stroke
Pussy wetter than ever, enough to sink a boat

[Chorus] + [Post-Chorus]

[Verse 2: Fat Joe & Chris Brown]
Never hesitate, purchasing in every state
Transported in foreign cars to large estates
So believe me, you know you wanna come home girl
As long as we can kick it with your home girl
Had two on one fast break that's a slam dunk
I know you want it, I can take you where ya man won't
Champs, Alize, think Rolls Royce
Yellow Nuvo and pink boy shorts

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Girl you got that bomb thing on I can't resist
I'mma light some candles girl then tie up your wrists
Then I'm licking chocolate right off pf your stomach
Baby you ain't handled freaky shit like this
And I start dripping ice down ya spine
And I make you mine
And now you're telling all your girls I done tore it up
So don't be mad that they all want me, there's room for all of us

[Chorus]

[Outro: Chris Brown]
Shawty got a mean walk, a mean shoe game
The bitch badder than any bitch that you name
Come girl, just shake it
I want you naked

.[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
I won't be holding back, my love
I won't be holding back
I won't be holding back, my love
No I won't be holding back
Cause in the end you'll know I'ma want another round
Another round, another round
Boy I know I want another round
Another round

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I used to want you and her and her
And you and her and her

[Mary J. Blige]
And now you got me alone and me tonight
I'ma give you my all
All I want is you

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Hair in a bun cause sometimes your hair just hides your beauty
Swear on my son, ain't too many things could hide your booty
Call me what you like, but bet I slide with cutie
Kenny name wasn't Bud, but he still ride with Rudy
And that's why we comfortable as a Huxtable
You been around since the Lunchables, girl I fucks with you
In the back of the truck with you, same fingers I chuck with two
I'm just playing with you, thinking bout staying with you
Not forever but at least until the A.M. with you
Still playing with it, but you like it raw
Might need a morning after, what we did the night before
Might go another round if you're trying to fight me more

[Hook: Mary J. Blige & Chris Brown]

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
Cake cake cake cake cake, I know you love it
Icing like Nuvo with a touch of red velvet
Look at you, you a star
I'm a G, Joe the Don
Super thief, I go hard
In these sheets, I'm a God
Lord, Emilio Pucci leggings for good behavior
I wanna tear them shits off you like Hulkamania
Then dive up in the pussy, Superfly Snuka
Have you coming back to back, more sex to cook up
But ask the girl will I hit advance
She pokes it out picture perfect, Instagram
I hit home runs and drain last shots
She tore her ACL from all the backshots

[Hook: Mary J. Blige & Chris Bown]

[Verse 3: Kirko Bangz]
See, she done came down
Double cup with ice
Man, I think she got some drink from me
Ever since I came round
She say she feel wrong
Cause her boyfriend listen to me
I don't give a damn bout it
That nigga, if he trip, I got a whole clique of killers with me
See, I'm the man now
Rolling 24's through the hood, women checking for me
Girl, I ain't playing 'round
Pull up to the crib, hope you wearing something special for me
And I'mma lay it down
Round one, two, and three can you keep up with me

[Hook: Mary J. Blige & Chris Brown]Aiyyo Fat Joe, it's your first album right?
You comin out the South Bronx
Time to let brothers know what time it is

[Gizmo]
I'm from the West Bubblefuck so fasten your seatbelts and buckle up
I'm the type of brother to beat you down then fuck you up
Grabbin the mic to rock on tonight to see if the crowd will care
Step to the Gizzy you dare, you get lit up like a flare
From the, Bronx the Boogie Down battleground, Uptown
Turn smiles to frowns as I smack clowns around
Shorts I don't take em, bones I fracture and break
So make not one mistake, or you get eat like steaks at Frank's G
Jack in June, gettin swept, with a broom soon
To meet your doom, mornin night or the afternoon
Harassin the mic, with a verbal assault of rap
Stick lyrics back to back, that'll pack, to keep myself on wax
Hot like an iron, to defeat the kids you gotta keep tryin
If you spread any rumors sayin you took me out, you're lyin
A human beat is struck I know when it really sounds trunk
I'm never ever buck I don't give a fuck if you think that I'm a sucker
Parties that I've made, people wonder how long it lasted
Lyrics that are so hardcore, it'll leave you flabbergasted
Gasp for air, inhale it hold it in
And just wait for the rest of the posse to begin
I'm the human beat magician with the bag full of fun
Ammunition's the addition to the sawed offfff!

"Sawed off shotgun, hand on the pump" -] Cypress Hill

[Keith Keith]
Run for help when the mic's in my hand
I kick rhymes like I'm a rap Van Damme
And eat MC's like a cake or a slice of pie
I'm not a pimp but I bop like I'm Superfly
People say who's he? I'll give any crew beef
So act like you know or get ate-n like stew, chief
I hold my own yet don't stand alone, I'm well known
Go 'head and front and get smocked like a neckbone
Think you better chill troop, cause I'm not havin that
And flippin on niggas like a somersaultin acrobat
Go get your crew and y'all still couldn't do the man
I'm blowin up in ninety-three like an ash can
I know niggas sip this, bitches wanna dip this
I snatch your girl up, and molest her like a rapist
Huh, go 'head and look real hard like I'm a sucka
I'll beat that ass like the L.A. trucker fucka
So step up and let me hear your response
Yeah, yo, another wild nigga from the Bronx

[King Sun]
Mr. Fifty-Two pick-up, nobody move
It's a stick-up, which proves, my getaway is butter smooth
I'm not the Smooth Operator with the ladies
But I get kinda crazy if you let me pick the daisies
One thing never say run, King Sun
I never ran, cause in my hand, I keeps a gun
Representin where I'm from in a bumrush
Roll up, flip, then be out on the hush-hush
Don't touch or feel, it's real, showin mad skills
Hotter than heat, yet colder than the Catskills
Don't play the yard, fake Gods ain't got nuttin for me
I'm loungin with Tone and Corey
On one-six-oh, then I go and check Fat Joe
On Trinity, the South Bronx vicinity
Smokin up your favorite MC like a dread smoke skunk
Cause I'm another wild nigga from the Bronx
Hittin em up, settin em up, splittin em up, gettin em up
Rippin em up, trippin em up, bag em! Zippin em up
Makin them shout, playin them out, son ain't the one
The bigga the nigga to bust em with the sawed off shotgun

[Fat Joe]
Aww shit, what we have here
Ninety-three and it's a brand new year
My name is Fat Joe I got shit locked down
Runnin with the Latins and the blacks from Uptown
It's a damn shame, you better maintain
I'm causin hysteria blowin niggas out the frame
Yes I can-can, I'm the Fat Man
Never run, never ran, it's not in the plan
I got skills you best chills, get off the dillsnilz
Your rhymes are trash and no frills
Carbon copy you're sloppy, see Joe ain't the one
I'm beatin bootleggers down with King Sun
Rollin over niggas like a truck
I come from the Bronx, a.k.a., West Bubblefuck
My rhymes are homicidal, I take your title
I'm Joe Da Fat Gangsta, far from Billy Idol
I get you open on the freestyle tip
Now are you hip to the way I flip the script? Hah
I'm Puerto Rican, I'll leave you dead and stinkin
I pimp in my beamer, do my drivebys in a Lincoln
Hip-Hop was born Uptown, the Boogie Down
If you bring your whole crew I shut 'em down!
I'm known from state to state, for shootin down punks
I'm another wild nigga from the Bronx

[Run]
Got senoritas in Adidas over in Spain
The Don of San Juan got 'em goin insane
Got chicks in Spanish Harlem holdin they brain
In Sao Paolo they follow, doin the same
Admiration for Run since "Sucker M.C.'s"
Papi bilingual, sell a single with ease
Y'all think that I'm done, Run don't got no flow?
What is you loco?  I'm grande gato pa-po
Run and Bo, D.M.C. and Fat Joe
Fo' cats on the same track got dough
Us cuatro, lock flow, you don't know?
From New York City to Puerto Rico (whoa)

[Chorus]
Ay papi, tu sabe, yo tengo fiebre para ti
You got my fire burnin..
Ay papi, tu sabe, yo tengo fiebre para ti
You got my fire burnin..

[Fat Joe]
Uhh, uhh
What's goin on black?  Goin platinum and beyond that
Layin down the format, sippin on that Cognac
Where the Don at?
I'm at Hollis with the kings payin homage to the things
They accomplished in they teens and I never stop throwin them flings
Control of the game, I'm right here over the rain
A human pot of gold, I already had a lot of flow
Ready to rock steady with Run and make a lot of dough

[D.M.C.]
You might tell from the way I talk
That sucker MC's is who I stalk
Create in a rhyme that is in formation
Or why I made such a rap creation
That is bound, to be reknowned
Within this city as a funky sound
And to those that try to put me down
My DJ has jams, by the pound (c'mon, let's go)

[Chorus]

[Bo Skaggs Nitty]
Skaggs Nit'
Aiyyo I rolled up, in the spot that I rolled up
My ice glitter like hold up
All the chickens like, "Look at Bo, he done growed up
Thinks he the bomb, bet his beeper stay blowed up"
So much frost on my wrist look my fist froze up
A photographer is tryin to get a little close up
Why cause I'm a star now?  Buy out the bar now?
Or I press one button, start up my car now?
I heard that you wanna spar now, so baby it's on
I spit flows, rip shows 'til the day that I'm gone
And this day I hit 'em off I'll have America sewn
Rich plat', rims chrome, spin (?) to your dome
I entered your home, lick you down, strictly to bone
The hit that I'm on got Spanish mamis singin my song

[Chorus] - 1.5XYeah.. now in ninety-three
Everybody knows the flav
Fat Joe Da Gangsta, yeah
You know my style

Fat Joe, a.k.a. Da Fat Gangsta
I'm no joke, and I'm far from a prankster
I got skills, aiyyo word life
Suckers is scared, because they know I live trife
As I troop down the streets of a ghetto
Skins are jockin, and always screamin hello
But I keep drivin in my jet black Beamer
I'm not a daydreamer, but I'm known as a scheamer
I'm dead-ass, when it comes to this
And if you fuck around, your moms'll reminisce
Thinkin of the good times she spent with her son
Somebody shoulda told you that I wasn't the one
Yes I'm known to get nuff respect
And if you face Fat Joe, well then you face your death
Now in ninety-three, it's time to take a stand
And you know how I'm livin, I'm a bad, bad, man

Niggas know the flav
"I'm a bad, bad, man!" (cut and scratched 2X)

Check it
All the old folks, hate my guts
Cause I be hittin all they daughters and they big fat butts
Cause I'm the papichulo when it comes to rap
And if you fuck with me, then you leave handicapped
I don't give a fuck, don't care who you are
I gotta say peace to my peeps GangStarr
Some real motherfuckers from around the hood
When I chills with them, we be up to no good
Hittin skins, makin ends
Loungin with my friends in my fat BM
Whether Uptown in the Boogie Down
Or checkin out stunts in the Polo Ground
See just like Mel, I'm internationally known
And I'm mob related, like Al Capone, check it
Too hot to handle, blow you like a candle
You never catch Joe in the middle of a scandal
Now in ninety-three it's time to take the stand
And you know how I'm livin, I'm a bad, bad, man!

Everybody knows the flav
"I'm a bad, bad, man!" (cut and scratched 2X)

One day I was chillin, caught a buckshot
The nigga was butt, so then he gets no props
Word spread fast around town
I was layin six feet deep underground, check it
Niggas wished the worst, but spoke too fast
Cause here I am and I'm ready to blast *gunshot*
The cops must have missed, takin me for a bitch
Because they tried to gas me, and make me turn snitch
But I'm not the one for peace
So I turned around and said, "Fuck the police!"
I'm the type to handle this on my own
Pack two joints and pass one to Tone
There's no shame in my game, I do what I gotta do
See I'm rollin with a crazy live crew
Now in ninety-three it's time to take a stand
And you know how I'm livin I'mma bad, bad, man!

Yeah! Niggas know the flav
"I'm a bad, bad, man!" (cut and scratched)
Nuff respect to my man Jazzy J
Diamond D, Showbiz and A.G., and I'm out
Word

"I'm a bad, bad, man!" (cut and scratched to end)[Intro: Fat Joe]
That Hublot, that king size Hublot

[Hook: Teyana Taylor]
Ballin’, dribble dribble shoot, swish

Ballin’, if you ain't gettin money get from round me (Ballin’)

[Verse 1- Fat Joe]
Yeah, uh, it's Crack.. yeah, uh
No matter the weather, can’t imagine it better
Got me lookin’ for Claire in the Bill Cosby sweater
Hundred bottles is better and they come in those cases
I’m talkin’ peoples and places, we make it light up like Vegas
Ugh, I swear this bitch is dumb as shit
But her ass is even dumber
Now thats dumber and dumber; how to take off a summer
Took a flight out to Russia, we even flew out her mother huh
Fuck you niggas talkin’ bout?
At the Rucker I was about to bring Jordan out
They want to get Coke wet cause of my fan base
I used to get coke wet, I had to fan base

[Hook]

[Verse 2- Wiz Khalifa]
Uhh, T.S. whattup
(Hahahaha... you know I'm young and rich)
O Versace shades and some OG J’s
Keep some OG blaze cause that’s what got me paid
Rockin all this Wang, they look at me strange
Lots of DiamondAir when I'm on the plane
Ridin’ through the city me and Joe Crack
A pound of what I’m puffin’ cost you four stacks
Niggas get it twisted cause my tour selled
What the fuck you think a nigga was before rap?
And my crib is new and I talk shit in my interviews
And my wife called my interludes, I don't break laws I just bend the rules
Got racks might spend a few
Couldn’t walk a day in my shoes, got my own day you seen it in the news
Presidential smoke presidential Rolee'
Porsche 911, picture me rollin’
Poppin’ champagne OG kush-a-holic’
Put that in your phone, whether you call it

[Hook]

[Verse 3- Fat Joe]
Yeah, uh...
Hahahaha, coke up in her bra
Nerve of you all a crip is a Colliseum
Olajuwon nigga I just Akeem
Worry about the bell, my niggas they got to free em
Champagne dreams and broke pockets
This why we call em niggas false prophets
Ballin’, bitch I'm fuckin ballin’
You can call me Spalding or maybe even Rawlings
Met her at the Esseses over there in New Orleans
She said she kinda shy but her body keep callin’
Yeah they keep callin’, I ain't even into them
Niggas jump ship, Pirates of the Carribean
Tell Wiz roll and smoke foggin’ my glasses
Niggas is my sons, I should claim em on my taxes
Look how big her ass is, I think she got the Nicki plan
(Ballin’) but I ain't passin or dribblin’

[Hook][Fat Joe]
Yeah, T.S., yeah, uhh
Yo, yo...

Wonder if we all V-S'es'us
Wanna know the streets that we fuss
Now sit back and witness the di-rector's cut
And niggas throw your T.S.'s up {BEAT NOVACANE!}

[Fat Joe]
Go figure it, Joe Crack runnin New York
Who woulda thunk it, God above and Pun did
Yeah, they came while I was 'sleep
Whispered in my ear this is your year {CRACK PREACH!}
So I testify
To burn down the throne, niggas follow my lead
Save your breath for crownin me King of N.Y
I'm the one and only Godfather, one through three
Pardon me, but I was raised in the projects
Forgettin I wasn't the only object
We was more concerned with cuttin up and choppin
Supplyin fiends with that work, get it poppin
Now who wanna pop off 'til they head get popped off
By the realest MC, and that's ME!
Joe Crack the Don, I came from the streets
Knee deep in the game, other half in the streets
I got that permit to bury ya ice grill
Shoulda named this album hurr "Licensed to Kill"
Ahhh - yes my life chilly chill
Mansion in Miami, other in the Jersey Hills
Chillll, that's that '88 flow
Small face 20's, that's that '88 dough
Joey Jefferson, I'm on the 88th flo'
Khaled him with that talk nigga {UN, UN, UN, UNBELIEVABLE!}

[Hook: repeat 2X]
One Phantom, two castles, and a Jeep fo'
Five mics a classic, kinda like my six-fo'
Several years I earned cake, let me tell you more
Joey Crack, a.k.a. '88, Cook Coke

[Fat Joe]
Wonder why I paint a picture of the street life so vivid I lived it
Y'all dudes innocent, y'all just visitin
And that's the reason why they call me ghetto
D.O., have you homeless {?} diggin deep holes
Police know, but just couldn't figure me out
I'm like {?}, have 'em makin pies in the house
It's grill, spit fire like I never been out
And I ain't gon' retire 'til there's never a doubt
The wheels, in my head keep spinnin
I'm thinkin anybody go against me losin chil'ren
I'm thinkin there's no better time than now to start some killin
It's Cook Coke Crack, 2005's ghetto version of Achilles NIGGA

[Hook]

[Fat Joe]
Yo, yo, loop this and you crash the remix
And forget who you thought I was, I'm Crack BEYOTCH
The same dude that made you "Lean Back"
And had that nigga Ma$e spittin that gangsta shit
Can't wait 'til my nigga Shyne come home
Six minutes, six minutes, Joey Crack you're on
Uh-um, uh-um, is my microphone on? Yes
New York, look I brought the championship home
Now, through up your peace signs to the sky
For all our soldiers that died
That means Biggie Smalls, 2Pac, Big L and Left Eye
And Big Pun the greatest of all time, sing it with me now

[Hook]

[Repeat 2X]
Wonder if we all V-S'es'us
Wanna know the streets that we fuss
Now sit back and witness the di-rector's cut
And niggas throw your T.S.'s up {BEAT NOVACANE!}[Intro]
We over here
Its the wild life...you heard?
Yo...yo Pun set it off yo

[Verse 1: Big Punisher]
I'll put the muthafuckin' blows like a pro supposed to
And hold a loaded toe for all the pistol smokers now initialed on my shoulder holster
You know the culture when its East Coast we run the streets most
Who want beef, turn your peeps into meatloaf
You know the steez, when its murderin' third degrees
We observe the breathe, and move with the wind like birds and bees
Word to Jeez, Christ I'm nice, go ahead roll the dice
You know the price, your kid and your crib like the poltergeist
I'm cold as ice, control your life with the mic
And then take your crown and break you down like liquid nitrogen
Invite your men, I'll strike your chin while you're rapping
I'll get on some Brooklyn shit, grab my clip and start clappin'
Make your heart flatten, stop acting retarded
All you flea hearted villains know you building off what we started
The streets are guarded heavily, where the violence doubles
Forty fives and shovels ready in the five livest boroughs

[Hook] x4
I keep tellin' ya'll (Be on your best behavior)
When I come through (Be on your best behavior)

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
Yo be on your best quietest kept
Boy Ima fire this Tec
Blow holes through ya dome just for lying on ya rep
I'm sick and tired of the threats
To say the least, my niggas play for keeps
Cut the middle finger off your favorite niece
Blaze your peeps just for talkin' shit
So unfortunate you had to come across this clique
We been doin' this for years, ruinin' the fierce (kids)
Niggas never want to listen to the toolies in the ear
Feel the fear when you fuckin' with the Bronx finest
We old timers, get snatched and catch a case of Alzheimer's
These small timers be really thinkin' that we be sleepin
'Till they find 'em leakin' on the side of the Major Deegan
I hate to cease it but I gotta do it
For no reason spill your body fluid when my bullets travel through it
You down to do it, then stop frontin' the cops comin'
Ya'll niggas some bitches that never shot nothin'!

[Hook] x4
I keep tellin' ya'll (Be on your best behavior)
When I come through (Be on your best behavior)[Fat Joe]
Blam!
Bang bang baby!
Yeah, Terror Squad style
Trizzie, check it out now

[Cuban Link]
Yo, I'm rated X in sex, I flex like Lex Luger
So who's next to get scooped up by this roughneck from Cuba?
We do maneuvers like Super Dave, always with a group of babes
Laying mami's out like Sugar Ray
Cause Cuban Link don't play miss, I flip and do some strange [shit]
Witchu like hit you with the whips and chains, check it
I get you naked like I'm mystic, cause this [dick] is
Thick as a brick, raw with big [balls] that bend it
Now let's get, physical, my jiggable pie
Let this lyrical guy scuba dive right between your thighs
I satisfy like a Snickers bar cause I'm the bigger bar
That'll stick you quicker than a 'spic will strip a car
My repoitoire holds a four star performance with all women
Hittin more skins than Alec Baldwin
You're fallin in love and you can't get up
Now check the cut, I stripped ya, now you can't strut, word up

Chorus: Big Pun

Bet ya man can't do it like that (like that?)
He can't work the middle, cause his thing too little
Bet ya man can't do it like that (like that?)
I make you scream papa (you the best dada!)

Chorus

[Fat Joe]
Yeah, uh, uh, yo
Paradin in the Palladium, all eyes on my presence
Poppin the Crist', sportin the chick straight out of Essence
Word up, patch thug, three quarter front Polo jiggy
Be like 'Who is he, lookin like a grizzly?'
While your girl watch me, you're busy drink pissy
Wanna lay your love, but your love wanna kiss me, huh
I got a fly team, me and my guys gleam like high beams
Makin the killin off of fiends with pipe dreams
It might seem, like I'm conceited with the C.R.E.A.M. talk
But I got the kind of green that could bribe a Supreme Court
And when we talk, the whole world listen
Turn your back to T.S. for one second and find your girl missin

[Big Pun]
Baby make me holla, take it off, I give you dolla
We can party til manana ain't nobody gotta know nada
Word to Allah, give me some Mississippi massana
I'll be in the sauna, chupin' the nalga like the chupacabra
Cool it mama, you gettin too hot, bust a shot
Boo-yaa! Rub it up and down like my oo-wops
Sucia!, show me your dirty dance
The way you work the pants make any man wanna jerk his gnads

Chorus

[Cuban Link]
Yo, my [shit's] official like it in you like, Keith Murray
Bury my beef, gettin your sweet cherry every week if necessary
I'm very nasty like Nas, did you ask me?
Pass me those [ass]cheeks and I'll bring you joy like BlackSTREET
In the backseat of my Jeep, we can chill
Or Creep like TLC but don't sleep, I keep it real
What the deal mami, you wanna feel on my steel salami?
Come and try me, I'll sign my name all over your punani

[Triple Seis]
Ohh mami, you comin home with me
All night in my tub drinkin Hennessey
Gettin lyed up with your thighs up, I'mma surprise her
When I rise up, inside her
Yippie kay yay, I'mma ride her, and guide her
Straight to the triz, where we goin, straight to the crib
Pun in here and Cuban and Seis, you know what time it is
Soon as we walk in the crib, let's get biz

TRIZ TRIZ TRIZ TRIZ TRIZ TRIZ TRIZ TRIZ (oahkayyy!)

Chorus: Big Pun

Since ya man can't do it like Link (like Link?)
He can't work the middle, cause his thing too little
Bet ya man can't do it like Seis (like Seis?)
I make you scream papa (you the best dada!)

Bet ya man can't do it like Crack (like Crack?)
He can't work the middle, cause his thing too little
Bet ya man can't do it like Pun (like Pun?)
I make you scream papa (you the best bana!)

Bet ya man can't do it like Link (like Link?)
He can't work the middle, cause his thing too little
Bet ya man can't do it like Seis (like Seis?)
I make you scream papa (you the best dada!)

Bet ya man can't do it like Crack (like Crack?)
He can't work the middle, cause his thing too little
Bet ya man can't do it like Pun (like Pun?)
I make you scream papa -- adios mama!"You ain't got no wins in mi casa"-Method Man from 'Method Man'
"Puerto Rico hooooo"

Doo Wop:
If your Puerto Rican and you know it clap your hands (clap clap)
If your Puerto Rican and you know it clap your hands (clap clap)
If your black, spanish, white whatever everybody clap your hands
And it's the Puerto Rican rebel
Crank up the treble bump up the bass
Doo Wop goin' ape
The kid from the tape What's Goin' On What's Goin' On

Fat Joe:
Niggas can't deal with the real WORD IS BORN

Doo Wop:
My nigga Joe good lookin' check it my title never got tooken
From San Juan to Brooklyn
I am the undefeated undisputed
Eat cootchie fiend it every time I gets buddhed
Sip Corona with Mona the bitch from Myona
I didn't bone her (why?) cause she's a blood doner
And you know about the virus
Fuck 5-0 Doo Wop is New Yorks Finest
DJ slash MC competition envy
Cause I bounce in each and every Benzy
Check me with Frankie Cutlass
Uh Boriquas On Da Set motherfuckers

Hook
"Mic check Boriquas on the set"
"Yeah you ain't got no wins in mi casa"-Method Man from 'Method Man'
(x4)

Fat Joe:
YEAH guess who comes out the camp
The undisputed heavy weight Bronx champ
Niggas know the time niggas know the deal
Niggas know that nigga Fat Joe is mad real
Check it who wants to disrespect
Iraq connect I take your life in a sec (boom boom)
Fuck around now you Snaggle Pusses foe
Flip it in spanish and be like ?mamma man lecho?
It's the illest nigga from the BOOGIE DOWN
Represent everyday with the FOUR POUND
Rap aggressor, MC stresser
When ever horny I'm fuckin' bitches on my dresser
Even downtown white boys recognize
Fat Joe number one yo it ain't no surprise
I'm rippin' mics for days to days
And I plan to Be Around like Frankie Beverly and Maze
Fat Joe on the track with Frankie Cutlass
Yo Boogie bring on the motherfuckin' ruckus

Hook

Evil Twins:
I sit back and I simply wonder rappers ponder
I stick I move my crew makes noise like thunder
It's the third haven't you heard thats another story
The board of Rican is steadily seekin' for my piece of glory
(yeah) When I say glory I don't refer to riches
Cause riches put a lot of niggas in our new ditches
Sometimes material dreams make ya scheme
Now ya nature graffitti on the wall in the streets scenes
Check it attention eruption invastion
My height, my pride my stride means I'm not caucasion
Yeah you best leave this kid alone
I have melatone not fully blown
But I've been known to bless a microphone
See True & Binky keep it real kickin' street facts
Head cracks for the blacks and the aerowax
My Aztec roughnecks get love too
And if you ain't from the ghetto then motherfuck you

Hook(Crack)
Born in da ghetto! Pots getting ready!
On with the metal! Pac, Makavelli!
Born in da ghetto! Pots getting ready!
On with the metal! Pac, Makavelli!

(Angel)
Born in the ghetto, raised in the struggle
Ratchet got the casket, Crack got the shovels
Bombs in the luggage,  Guns in the duffle
Makaveli on I think New York is in Trouble
Suicidal thoughts as I'm getting high to BIG
Pun on the speakers when The God wanna triz
PuertoRoc Puro big ups to Carolina
A pound of the piff got these Mamis looking china
Nemos with the pina got them in the loop
It ain't nothing but a G Thang I'm feeling like Snoop
My cubs wanna shoot, My Lionz wanna stab
We them TerrorSquad Gods man everythings for grabs
Stop!
Pay attention to what the Don Do!
If you got hate in your blood we look beyond you
You can't even bear or imagine the pain I've gone through
You'll have to murder yourself and kill your mom's too

(Crack)
Born in da ghetto! Pots getting ready!
On with the metal! Pac, Makavelli!
Born in da ghetto! Pots getting ready!
On with the metal! Pac, Makavelli!

(Ry So Valid)

Came out the room, raised by a gangsta
On with the metal, prepare to meet ya maker!
All got machetes, fuck around and shank ya
My guys cheffin pies, in the kitchen like a baker
Get it on the curb! Chirp on the razor
Put em under tounges how you talk with the razor!
Put in the word, head pushed back by manito!
Came to the Bronx, Lionz Pride be Junito!
But I’m on a private, on the way to Cartagena
And when the yacht charter, the emblem say Cartagena
Roaming around in Rome, and my bitch is a Moana Lisa
Probly piling a kilo, got that Pepi Le Pue
Probly C.O my company, Executive Move
Took a dive in the pool, its bout the size of my room
Chillin with barbera walters, saw that bitch on the view
Textin Obama’s daughters when theres nothing to do
If you was rich as us you would be doing it to!
Niggas this that glamour life, talking Tony Montana life
Chichi get the yayo, snapple strawberry kiwi
Took it up to Orlando, visit my Titi Kimi
Wearing the Red Octobers, nigga its still september
Twisted like a blender, can’t touch this that MC Hammer
Banana clips go bananas, I go thru bricks like I’m Santa
They going loco Four Loko
Just sipped some Coco Loso…
All my followers looking at me for motivation
I jump off yachts, got more spots then dalmations
Off shore A.P’s, Maybach’s is so spacious
Sent Nasa 50 m’s, bought a new space ship
Couple shots to ya grill, give a nigga the face lift!
Face it, y’all basic, Im abstract… ASICS
Can't keep it simple cuz simple niggas gon base it!
Took the bar, raised it
Ya bars FADED……
Sky box high getting ELEVATED!
And this just a reminder nigga, ya bars FADED!
