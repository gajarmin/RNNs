[Intro]
And you say Chi city!
Chi city! Chi city!

[Hook: Chris Martin]
I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
Cause I'm coming home again

[Verse 1]
I met this girl when I was 3 years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said "Excuse me lil homey, I know you don't know me
But, my name is Windy and I like to blow trees"
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off
And make 'em straighten up their hat cause she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime her face lit up, so astounding
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers cause they always leave
She said it felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said "'Ye, keep making that keep making that platinum and gold for me!"

[Hook]
I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
Cause I'm comin' home again
Comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
Now I'm coming home again
Maybe we can start again

[Verse 2]
But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't have never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her, but when I talk to her
It always seems like she talking 'bout me
She said, "You left your kids, and they just like you
They want to rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you" and I just got through
Talking 'bout what we tryna do: just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
Every interview I'm representing you, making you proud
Reach for the stars so if you fall, you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talking 'bout Chi-Town!

[Hook]
I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
Cause I'm comin' home again
Comin' home again
Maybe, do you remember when
Fireworks at Lake Michigan
Oh, now I'm coming home again
Comin' home again
Maybe you, do you remember when?
Fireworks at Lake Michigan
Oh, now I'm comin' home again
Maybe we can start again

[Outro: Chris Martin]
Loyee oyeee oh, loyee oyeee oh
Comin' home again
Loyee oyeee oh, loyee oyeee oh
Coming home again
Maybe we can start again[Produced by Jon Brion, Kanye West & Warryn Campbell]

[Hook: Really Doe]
You muh'fuckers better do your job and roll up, and watch how we roll up
An', I can't control it, I can't hold it, it's so nuts
I take a sip of that 'gnac, I wanna fuck
I take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck
But really what's amazin is how I keep blazin'
Towel under the door, We smoke until the day's end
Puff puff and pass, don't fuck up rotation
Hpnotiq for Henny? Now nigga that's a chaser
Turn nuttin to somethin, now pimpin that's a savior
Best things are green now pimpin get your paper
High off the ground from stair to skyscraper
Cool out, thinkin we local c'mon homey we major

[Kanye West]
We major? C'mon homey we major
We major? C'mon homey we major
We major, c'mon homey we major
We major, c'mon

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Feelin better than some head on a Sunday afternoon
Better than a chick that say yes too soon
Until you have a daughter that's what I call karma
And you pray to God she don't grow breasts too soon
Projects to' up, gang signs is thrown up
Niggas hats broke off, that's how we grow up
Why else you think shorties write rhymes just to blow up?
Get they first car and then IRS show up
He ain't never had shit, but he had that 9
Nigga come through flickin and he had that shine
Put 2 and 2 together and a little bad weather
Gon' be your whole family on that funeral line
Asked the reverend was the strip clubs cool
If my tips helped send a pretty girl through school
That's all I want, like winos want they good whiskey
I ain't in the Klan but I brought my hood with me

[Hook]

[Nas]
We major? C'mon homey we major
We major? C'mon homey we major
We major! C'mon homey we major
We major! C'mon homey we major

[Verse 2: Nas]
I heard the beat and I ain't know what to write
First line should it be about the hoes or the ice?
Fo-fo's or Black Christ? Both flows'd be nice
Rap about big paper or the black man plight
At the studio console, asked my man to the right
What this verse sound like, should I freestyle or write?
He said, "Nas what the fans want is Illmatic, Stillmatic"
Looked at the pad and pen, fell, and jotted what I feel
Been like twelve years since a nigga first signed
Now I'm a free agent and I'm thinkin it's time
To build my very own Motown
Cause rappers be deprived, of executive 9 to 5's
And it hurts to see these companies be stealin the life
And I love to give my blood sweat and tears to the mic
So y'all copped the LP's and y'all fiends got dealt
I'm Jesse Jackson on the balcony when King got killed
I survived the livest niggas around
Last longer than more than half of you clowns
Look, I used to cook before I had the game took
Either way my change came like Sam Cooke

[Tony Williams]
Feeling better than I ever felt before today
Like better late than never is orientation
Still we can make it better throwing all your cares away

[Hook]

[Tony Williams]
Feeling better than I ever felt before today
But better late than never, it's
Orien-tation, still we can make it better
Throwin all your cares away

[Hook]

[Kanye] + (Nas)
We major? (C'mon homey we major)
We MAJOR?! (C'mon homey we major)
We major (C'mon homey we major)
We major

[Tony Williams]
Feeling better than I ever felt before today
But better late than never, it's
Orien-tation, still we can make it better
Throwin all your cares away

[Music starts to fade until 5:21 in the song]

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Can I talk my shit again?
Can I talk my shit again?!
I can't believe I'm back up in this muh'fucker
I'mma be late though
I gotta figure out what I'm gonna wear
Yeah... the Roc is definitely in the building
GOOD Music's definitely in the building
I gotta say what's up to Tony Williams
On the vocals sings, he sings quite beautifully
Don't you agree? Don't you agree?
Uhh, and Jon Brion on the keys right now
And Warren Campbell on the keys right now
So they ask me - why you call it Late Registration 'Ye?
Cause we takin these muh'fuckers back to school
If you know this part right here, feel free to sing along

[Outro: Tony Williams] + (Kanye West)
Feeling better than I ever felt before today (If you feelin good)
But better late than never; it's orien-tation (It's orientation)
Still we can make it better
Throwin all your cares away... (We want you to get used to this)
(Uhh, they cain't do what we do baby)
(Uh-uh, uh-uh, they cain't do what we do baby)
(Uh-uh, uh-uh, they cain't do what we do baby)
(Yeah...)Every dog has it's day

Another dirty 9 inch dick classic, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah...
Girrrrl... As I sit here sit here thinkin' to myself
There is no one for you but me and I mean that
And I've think about all the things we been through
Like all gettin' fightin' for example
You know the love we have for each other
It tends to out weight what we would do to one another
You know my grand daddy used to always say
You know he used to say it like this..

[Hook]
There will be ups and downs, smiles and frowns
Share with me fairy tales or make-believe

[Verse 1: Snoop]
What up motherfuckers, this is Snoop Dogg
I'm tryin' to figure out how the fuck I'mma do y'all
Hangin' with my homie from the turf, that's young q-ball
Givin' me the words on the street heres to scoop y'all
The niggas from the East Sidaz are split up (split up)
And one of 'em try to fuck your shit up (what?)
Nah cuz, don't believe that - that's my nigga for life
I'm out with the bullshit, I mean with the real shit
I'm at the church doing work, spittin' game for the pulpit
And that's the bidness and God is my witness
LBC, 213, hell yeah we in this - It's so relentless
And all my dogs up against the life sentence
I love y'all like I love no bitch and that's real shit
On some Crip shit - homie dig this

[Hook 2X]

[Verse 2: Snoop]
I used to have a lot broads that I don't fool with
I used to have a lot homeboys I ain't cool with
A lot of people that nigga went to school with
Happy as hell to see the big dog doin' it
But would none of them believe it though (What?)
That I would be bigger than Kurtis Blow
I guess he was right these are the breaks
Despite my mistakes and aches I'm getting cake
To realize your fate through faith
Cause we all gonna get that day (For what?)
To see if our lives was straight
And see if we would be able to walk through the pearly gates (Yeah?)
To see the man upstairs on some real talk homie
I'm tired of bein' stuck here
If I could I would fly to moon (zoom)
Y'all probably think I'm trippin' off these mushrooms
I know

[Hook 4X]

Now, as I think back to the words my grand daddy used to say
I've never seen him in church, but he always had the word
He always would tell me; "sometimes you gotta take the good with the bad"
"You gotta to do bad in other to do good"[Intro]
Sex, love and money, fun

DANGER
Ain't gotta say no more(I was raised in the hood)
Eastside Long Beach to be exact
(I was raised in the hood)
Where the grass is greener and the Crips are much meaner
(We got your back, I was raised in the hood)
I’ll never turn my back on the hood
Yeah you can take me out the hood
But you can’t take the hood up outta me

[Snoop Dogg - Verse 1]
Raised by the gangstas, the generals, the thieves, the twins
Yeah I’m stealing niggas, please what you know bout that
I do it everytime, told em 1800 had em mixing it with lime (oh weee)
My life is like a movie, I was thuggin in the beach when I lit my first doobie
In the same city where I got my first piece of coochie
Where I sold my first dime, and I held my first uzi
Bitch, choose me, cause I’m going to the top
Rap or the rock, them hoes say I’m on bitch
Whenever will it stop
I was poppin’like it’s on, slamming Chevy’s up the block
East up, what it do though
Now I ride 2-door, the Porsche looking mean
Hella far from broke, the 40 won’t choke plus a niggas still elope
Only cause I was raised in the hood

[Hook]
I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood)
I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood)
We got your back
I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood)
I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood)
We got your back

[Snoop Dogg - Verse 2]
Raised by the monsters the criminals
The G’s, it was the niggas on the East
What you know bout that?
Snoopy in his prime, I’m a boss
I catch a nigga slippin’ like moss
Ride with the realest , I’ve been on it since a young’n
It’s 200 bitches in the function
Looking cool, you know it bitchy I’m rollin’
And I ain't worried bout them niggas we patrolling the hood and the city
Rollin on that dilly
2 milli, 2 Bugatti’s, call em Rozay and Diddy
Heart of the set, homie I’m a vet
Lil nigga, keep ya clothes, ask around
I’m a rep, East up, what it do though
Hoes spillin’ Nuvo, Doggy on his tip
I threw up the two O
Hella far from broke, the 40 won’t choke plus a niggas still elope
Only cause I was raised in the hood

[Hook]
I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood)
I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood)
We got your back
I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood)
I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood)
We got your back

[Snoop Dogg - Verse 3]
Raised by them hustlas them dealers on the block
It was plenty of them niggas on the spot
What you know bout that?
Turned up fully
The hood raised me, gang-banging made me a bully, ya dig?
Burnt out and any party we at, you know it’s turned out
The people talking the rumours
Now what you heard about?
How I spend 100 thou gettin’ purped out
I’m strapped up, I keep a pistol for these suckers tryna act up
They know I’m famous, like I won’t get in the streets Cuz?
Like I don’t come from the W, I’m a beast bru
What it do though, dickies for the dulo
Homie, you know skinny niggas sumo
Hella far from broke, the 40 won’t choke plus a niggas still elope
Only cause I was raised in the hoodYou Ready for me..

[Hook: Xzibit]
I just wanna thank you, for bein around
And patiently waitin and holdin me down
It's easy to see, for Mr. X to the Z
That without no you, there could be no me
I just wanna thank you, for bein a fan
And watchin me grow from a boy to a man
It's easy to see, for Mr. X to the Z
That without no you, there could be no me

[Xzibit]
You 'bout to hear some words, that you ain't probably heard
With all of these rappers pullin' triggers and flippin' birds
I know it sound absurd, cause they don't tell the truth
They prostitutes, fuckin' contaminate the youth
But yet I'm guilty of, the things I said above
No matter my faults still continue to show me love
Naw I ain't perfect mayne, but yet I stay the same
I play chess not checkers but this is not a game
And this is not a song, and this is not a verse
It's not conceived, or simulated or been rehearsed
Spent the first half of my life, thinkin that I was cursed
Could have been hit with a hollow, follow behind my hearse
That wasn't meant for me, I spent a decade
Makin it what it's 'sposed to be, hopefully brought you close to me
All these people approachin me, don't even know the half
I could be facin life but X is signin autographs, damn

[Hook]

[Xzibit]
My son's 11 now, I got to see him grow
Makin his free throws, the way he laughin at the show
Yo he remind me of me, when I was ridin bikes
He gon' be taller than me, he got my mother's height
But yo you know the difference, between me and them others
They say you buggin when I call you my sisters and brothers
I coulda missed it all, I coulda dropped the ball
Mind of Metallica, motherfuck 'em and "Kill 'Em All"
I used to hustle raw, I used to run the streets
I used to hustle heats, I grinded all my beef
Most of my homies is gone, restin in peace
Some'll never see release from custody of police, but me
But nah my little dude get to go to private school
And I can do the things my father couldn't afford to do
That's what it's 'sposed to do, this is from me to you
Support from you and yours, thank you for gettin me through, true

[Hook]

[Xzibit]
We buried Proof today, it really broke me up
To see my brother in that casket, maaan what the fuck?
Media made me angry, I had to soak it up
The future is fragile never promised to none of us
Hittin so close to home, but what I focused on
Is how he lived, the lives he touched, the cornerstone
We never walk alone, although sometime it seems
That nightmares go hand in hand with livin out dreams
So let me take this time, from my struggle my grind
To let you know that I appreciate you by my side
It's been a long ride, a lot of long nights
A lot of long flights, worth every sacrifice
A soldier of fortune fearless fightin the good fight
I never had a plan B, I never lost sight
That's why I hit the stage, that's why I kill the mic
It's for my fans that's ridin with Xzibit for life, RIGHT!

[Hook]

[Outro]
Thank you, for lettin me breathe
For lettin me be who I am, huh, yeah, huh
Two little words, y'all never get to hear enough
Knahmsayin? Yeah that, hehe..
Yes.. the return
Uh-huh.. breathe![Verse 1:]

Oh man it's a miracle
How I came from a town, where most fall down
And never get up, I never gave up
I slipped up a couple of times, but I still raise up
Even though I'm scraped up, I keep fighting
They don't know I'm [?] up, cold sweats when i wake up
I see death as a [?], poverty, despair
Gotta kill 'em for a [?]
All the bloods, all the crips at the park to recruit
Thugs I grew up with, we used to do backflips
And drank cups with [?] pass the first sip
Higher Xscape, but can't seem to escape the middle scape
Go to act like an ape, man I can't fall for the trap
Or a state, nah, It's not a game, nah
I can't see it, I can't be it
Grown man, boy brained, locked up, going insane
In pain, late night, untamed [?]


[Hook 2x:]
A man, A man
Won't chance a thang
Maybe when I am, now I understand
A man, I'm a man

[Verse 2:]

Pops had me on the weekend,had a fifth on myself
He was preaching, he was teaching me: knowledge yourself
Jazz in the background, books on the shelf
Lil' herb, lil' liquor, go and get my belt
If my grades wasn't right, if I took school light
It was lights out, couple [?], see you later, good night
The message was clear, relate to fear
[?]
I had to go through somethin', to get me somethin'
That's how I got me somethin', and I ain't frontin'
It was though but it was worth it
If it's easy than it's worthless
But if you are on your JO, than It's workin'


[Hook 2x:]


[Verse 3:]

From a boy to a man, in between is the matrix
Baby momma's in court cases, living at three places
Keep dreaming and chase dreams, since eighteen
Nothing works, so you keep pacin' to make CREAM.
[?]
Depressed and find conflict as a player
Yeah, that was me, pitiful [?] young minded
Blinded by the alore of a whore, wildin' on tour
I had a couple dollars, but my spirit was poor
I ran my gifts in the ground, said I'm tired of it now
I didn't wanna rap, the homies kept tellin' me to take
Another lap
So I did, I never hit, I ain't a kid
I had to tell the [?] money to be a boss
I'm here to let you know, we all gotta grow
It won't stop, I keep it 100 when it comes to this hip-hop[Intro]
And you say Chi city!
Chi city! Chi city!

[Hook: Chris Martin]
I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
Cause I'm coming home again

[Verse 1]
I met this girl when I was 3 years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said "Excuse me lil homey, I know you don't know me
But, my name is Windy and I like to blow trees"
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off
And make 'em straighten up their hat cause she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime her face lit up, so astounding
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers cause they always leave
She said it felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said "'Ye, keep making that keep making that platinum and gold for me!"

[Hook]
I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
Cause I'm comin' home again
Comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
Now I'm coming home again
Maybe we can start again

[Verse 2]
But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't have never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her, but when I talk to her
It always seems like she talking 'bout me
She said, "You left your kids, and they just like you
They want to rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you" and I just got through
Talking 'bout what we tryna do: just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
Every interview I'm representing you, making you proud
Reach for the stars so if you fall, you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talking 'bout Chi-Town!

[Hook]
I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
Cause I'm comin' home again
Comin' home again
Maybe, do you remember when
Fireworks at Lake Michigan
Oh, now I'm coming home again
Comin' home again
Maybe you, do you remember when?
Fireworks at Lake Michigan
Oh, now I'm comin' home again
Maybe we can start again

[Outro: Chris Martin]
Loyee oyeee oh, loyee oyeee oh
Comin' home again
Loyee oyeee oh, loyee oyeee oh
Coming home again
Maybe we can start again[Verse 1: Damani Nkosi]
It's like water for the body
Food for the soul
A feelin' you don't wanna let go
So let go 
And stop fightin' it
I even smile when I'm writin' bout it
It's the sun to my thoughts 
When clouds try to crowd it
I use to run from it 
I use to hide to 
I thought it made me soft
Plus I was hood to 
Its the beat to my heart 
So the rhythm of my life can dance in peace at night
I got my style just right 
I got my mind just right 
I got to tell you bout this thing make everything alright
Momma cookin wit it 
Pops teachin wit it
Dub made the track just so i can speak wit it
I got to have it everyday hour on the hour 
Minute by the second if you feel it its a blessin 
When ya feelins' get arrested and you ain't trynn break free
You've just been touched L.O.V.E
Now that's love

[Hook: Musiq Soulchild]
Love me in a special way 
What more can I say 
Love me now
Repeat

[Verse 2: Damani Nkosi]
For the Love
It was never for the bread 
It was always bout the passion that turned into a action
That inspired the masses
Never for the dough
If the money wasn't right 
He'd sing just to show 
How a ribbon in the sky suppose to go 
Stevie, the KG's, the Kobe's, the MJ's both of them
We all love them 
Serena and Venus B and J the JB's who played for James B
Say it loud
I'm Black and I'm proud of how we all get down when loves around
It's the love for the music that makes me not lose it
My actions is the proof the words get confusing
I was once saul who then turned to Paul
I'm trynna tell all y'all that love conquers all
Kings last speech was deep
He knew he would pass 
But he promised L.O.V.E. 
Now that's love

[Hook: Musiq Soulchild]
Love me in a special way 
What more can I say 
Love me now
Repeat

[Bridge: Damani Nkosi]
My loved ones 
My loved ones 
My loved ones
What up to all my loved ones
My loved ones 
My loved ones 
My loved ones
All I need is my loved ones

[Piano Solo: Robert Glasper](I was raised in the hood)
Eastside Long Beach to be exact
(I was raised in the hood)
Where the grass is greener and the Crips are much meaner
(We got your back, I was raised in the hood)
I’ll never turn my back on the hood
Yeah you can take me out the hood
But you can’t take the hood up outta me

[Snoop Dogg - Verse 1]
Raised by the gangstas, the generals, the thieves, the twins
Yeah I’m stealing niggas, please what you know bout that
I do it everytime, told em 1800 had em mixing it with lime (oh weee)
My life is like a movie, I was thuggin in the beach when I lit my first doobie
In the same city where I got my first piece of coochie
Where I sold my first dime, and I held my first uzi
Bitch, choose me, cause I’m going to the top
Rap or the rock, them hoes say I’m on bitch
Whenever will it stop
I was poppin’like it’s on, slamming Chevy’s up the block
East up, what it do though
Now I ride 2-door, the Porsche looking mean
Hella far from broke, the 40 won’t choke plus a niggas still elope
Only cause I was raised in the hood

[Hook]
I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood)
I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood)
We got your back
I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood)
I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood)
We got your back

[Snoop Dogg - Verse 2]
Raised by the monsters the criminals
The G’s, it was the niggas on the East
What you know bout that?
Snoopy in his prime, I’m a boss
I catch a nigga slippin’ like moss
Ride with the realest , I’ve been on it since a young’n
It’s 200 bitches in the function
Looking cool, you know it bitchy I’m rollin’
And I ain't worried bout them niggas we patrolling the hood and the city
Rollin on that dilly
2 milli, 2 Bugatti’s, call em Rozay and Diddy
Heart of the set, homie I’m a vet
Lil nigga, keep ya clothes, ask around
I’m a rep, East up, what it do though
Hoes spillin’ Nuvo, Doggy on his tip
I threw up the two O
Hella far from broke, the 40 won’t choke plus a niggas still elope
Only cause I was raised in the hood

[Hook]
I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood)
I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood)
We got your back
I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood)
I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood)
We got your back

[Snoop Dogg - Verse 3]
Raised by them hustlas them dealers on the block
It was plenty of them niggas on the spot
What you know bout that?
Turned up fully
The hood raised me, gang-banging made me a bully, ya dig?
Burnt out and any party we at, you know it’s turned out
The people talking the rumours
Now what you heard about?
How I spend 100 thou gettin’ purped out
I’m strapped up, I keep a pistol for these suckers tryna act up
They know I’m famous, like I won’t get in the streets Cuz?
Like I don’t come from the W, I’m a beast bru
What it do though, dickies for the dulo
Homie, you know skinny niggas sumo
Hella far from broke, the 40 won’t choke plus a niggas still elope
Only cause I was raised in the hood[Intro]

DANGER
Ain't gotta say no moreTwo thousand five!!
There will be no room for y'all with no originality
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

[Missy - singing]
You're, the reason I don't trust no one
And I don't love no one, from the places I've come
The sad songs, I've sung, all the times I've been stung
Boy you, bring the worst out of me (HOLLA!)
And I cain't, allow these tears I've cried
The emptiness inside, that left me so petrified
Tried to keep, love alive, but I became too tired
Cause you, bring the worst out of me

[Hook]
And, I wish I coulda changed the way things have gone
And start life and do it now maybe once again (YES!)
I don't know when or where but somethin must have went wrong
And all I have to sayyyy, is now...

[Hook]
When I sing this song I get so tear-y eyed
Cause you get under my skin, can't let you suck me dry
I was gonna marry you, have kids for you
Stay true to you, live life with you
But look what you've, done, to me

[Missy - singing]
I, comprimised all my time
And rearranged my life, to make sure you was fine
Cause our love, was on the line, and I became so unkind
Cause you, brought the worst out of me (you brought the worst out of me)
This is, how the story goes (WOO!)
The others want to know, when it's out of control
You work, and you work, but someone gets hurt
And I guess, that, be, me

[Hook] w/ ad libs

[Hook]

[Hook] w/ ad libs[Xzibit] Yo, listen, huh

[Hook: Xzibit]
I just wanna thank you, for bein around
And patiently waitin and holdin me down
It's easy to see, for Mr. X to the Z
That without no you, there could be no me
I just wanna thank you, for bein a fan
And watchin me grow from a boy to a man
It's easy to see, for Mr. X to the Z
That without no you, there could be no me

[Xzibit]
You 'bout to hear some words, that you ain't probably heard
With all of these rappers pullin' triggers and flippin' birds
I know it sound absurd, cause they don't tell the truth
They prostitutes, fuckin' contaminate the youth
But yet I'm guilty of, the things I said above
No matter my faults still continue to show me love
Naw I ain't perfect mayne, but yet I stay the same
I play chess not checkers but this is not a game
And this is not a song, and this is not a verse
It's not conceived, or simulated or been rehearsed
Spent the first half of my life, thinkin that I was cursed
Could have been hit with a hollow, follow behind my hearse
That wasn't meant for me, I spent a decade
Makin it what it's 'sposed to be, hopefully brought you close to me
All these people approachin me, don't even know the half
I could be facin life but X is signin autographs, damn

[Hook]

[Xzibit]
My son's 11 now, I got to see him grow
Makin his free throws, the way he laughin at the show
Yo he remind me of me, when I was ridin bikes
He gon' be taller than me, he got my mother's height
But yo you know the difference, between me and them others
They say you buggin when I call you my sisters and brothers
I coulda missed it all, I coulda dropped the ball
Mind of Metallica, motherfuck 'em and "Kill 'Em All"
I used to hustle raw, I used to run the streets
I used to hustle heats, I grinded all my beef
Most of my homies is gone, restin in peace
Some'll never see release from custody of police, but me
But nah my little dude get to go to private school
And I can do the things my father couldn't afford to do
That's what it's 'sposed to do, this is from me to you
Support from you and yours, thank you for gettin me through, true

[Hook]

[Xzibit]
We buried Proof today, it really broke me up
To see my brother in that casket, maaan what the fuck?
Media made me angry, I had to soak it up
The future is fragile never promised to none of us
Hittin so close to home, but what I focused on
Is how he lived, the lives he touched, the cornerstone
We never walk alone, although sometime it seems
That nightmares go hand in hand with livin out dreams
So let me take this time, from my struggle my grind
To let you know that I appreciate you by my side
It's been a long ride, a lot of long nights
A lot of long flights, worth every sacrifice
A soldier of fortune fearless fightin the good fight
I never had a plan B, I never lost sight
That's why I hit the stage, that's why I kill the mic
It's for my fans that's ridin with Xzibit for life, RIGHT!

[Hook]

[Outro]
Thank you, for lettin me breathe
For lettin me be who I am, huh, yeah, huh
Two little words, y'all never get to hear enough
Knahmsayin? Yeah that, hehe..
Yes.. the return
Uh-huh.. breathe!Ice Cube]
All hail to the West coast, I am the grand wizard
The West coast warlord, and the future is today

Cause tomorrow - that shit never come
I worry 'bout today and this urban decay
I worry 'bout hip-hop, when did it flip-flop
Get whack, and turn into gridlock
I don't know is it a government plot?
I don't give a f**k whether you love it or not
That's all we got and if you throw it away
You dumb as OJ, off a for-tay
In your Izod, this the rap God
What'chu gon' put up, in your iPod?
Downloader, what'chu gon' do
When your favorite MC, got to sue you
Cause he got to eat ain't nuttin taboo
Get your ass beat by Erykah Badu
Cause you wanna steal this good music
Put me out of business, now you lose it

[Hook: sung with ad libs]
Tomorrow, don't you worry 'bout tomorrow
This is very hard to swallow
Keep your hand up on that throttle
Don't you worry 'bout tomorrow

[Ice Cube]
Tomorrow, I'mma handle my business
But today, I'mma drink this liquor
Cause tomorrow, I might be a little quicker
But today, I'm just the same old nigga
You know that shit is still a day away
Do yo' thang baby put your life on layaway
Cause everybody is Nostradamus
Boy don't you know that tomorrow ain't promised?
To all the lil' mamas
Don't do a nigga, like Isiah Thomas
If you a bitch, please be honest
Actin like a ho you're not an an-gel
While you're, daydreamin 'bout your future
Motherf**ker come around the corner and shoot you
Don'tcha, get stuck in neutral
Put your shit in drive, while you still alive cause

[Hook]

[Ice Cube]
Tomorrow~! That shit never come
I know it sounds strange but today is never done
I'm up in the Range when the clock strikes 1
While y'all countin sheep, I'm countin Benja-mons
Up on my feet at the break of the sun
President of the Gangster Na-tion
We don't go to war, we go to the store
We rob from the rich, and give to the poor
Hip-Hop, oh what a bore
Lettin college motherf**kers run the front door
(F**k that!) Let's take it back to the streets
Don't let Viacom, dictate the heat
The nerve of them, I never heard of dem
Askin me about, my urban spins
And if I got about, a thousand of them
I'm a crate MC, accordin to them
F**k that!

[Hook - repeat 2X]

[Ice Cube - over last repeat to fade]
All hail to the West coast, I am the grand wizard
The West coast warlord, the future is today
Get your grind on mayne, get your grind on mayne, get your grind onEvery dog has it's day

Another dirty 9 inch dick classic, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah...
Girrrrl... As I sit here sit here thinkin' to myself
There is no one for you but me and I mean that
And I've think about all the things we been through
Like all gettin' fightin' for example
You know the love we have for each other
It tends to out weight what we would do to one another
You know my grand daddy used to always say
You know he used to say it like this..

[Hook]
There will be ups and downs, smiles and frowns
Share with me fairy tales or make-believe

[Verse 1: Snoop]
What up motherfuckers, this is Snoop Dogg
I'm tryin' to figure out how the fuck I'mma do y'all
Hangin' with my homie from the turf, that's young q-ball
Givin' me the words on the street heres to scoop y'all
The niggas from the East Sidaz are split up (split up)
And one of 'em try to fuck your shit up (what?)
Nah cuz, don't believe that - that's my nigga for life
I'm out with the bullshit, I mean with the real shit
I'm at the church doing work, spittin' game for the pulpit
And that's the bidness and God is my witness
LBC, 213, hell yeah we in this - It's so relentless
And all my dogs up against the life sentence
I love y'all like I love no bitch and that's real shit
On some Crip shit - homie dig this

[Hook 2X]

[Verse 2: Snoop]
I used to have a lot broads that I don't fool with
I used to have a lot homeboys I ain't cool with
A lot of people that nigga went to school with
Happy as hell to see the big dog doin' it
But would none of them believe it though (What?)
That I would be bigger than Kurtis Blow
I guess he was right these are the breaks
Despite my mistakes and aches I'm getting cake
To realize your fate through faith
Cause we all gonna get that day (For what?)
To see if our lives was straight
And see if we would be able to walk through the pearly gates (Yeah?)
To see the man upstairs on some real talk homie
I'm tired of bein' stuck here
If I could I would fly to moon (zoom)
Y'all probably think I'm trippin' off these mushrooms
I know

[Hook 4X]

Now, as I think back to the words my grand daddy used to say
I've never seen him in church, but he always had the word
He always would tell me; "sometimes you gotta take the good with the bad"
"You gotta to do bad in other to do good"[Produced by Jon Brion, Kanye West & Warryn Campbell]

[Hook: Really Doe]
You muh'fuckers better do your job and roll up, and watch how we roll up
An', I can't control it, I can't hold it, it's so nuts
I take a sip of that 'gnac, I wanna fuck
I take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck
But really what's amazin is how I keep blazin'
Towel under the door, We smoke until the day's end
Puff puff and pass, don't fuck up rotation
Hpnotiq for Henny? Now nigga that's a chaser
Turn nuttin to somethin, now pimpin that's a savior
Best things are green now pimpin get your paper
High off the ground from stair to skyscraper
Cool out, thinkin we local c'mon homey we major

[Kanye West]
We major? C'mon homey we major
We major? C'mon homey we major
We major, c'mon homey we major
We major, c'mon

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Feelin better than some head on a Sunday afternoon
Better than a chick that say yes too soon
Until you have a daughter that's what I call karma
And you pray to God she don't grow breasts too soon
Projects to' up, gang signs is thrown up
Niggas hats broke off, that's how we grow up
Why else you think shorties write rhymes just to blow up?
Get they first car and then IRS show up
He ain't never had shit, but he had that 9
Nigga come through flickin and he had that shine
Put 2 and 2 together and a little bad weather
Gon' be your whole family on that funeral line
Asked the reverend was the strip clubs cool
If my tips helped send a pretty girl through school
That's all I want, like winos want they good whiskey
I ain't in the Klan but I brought my hood with me

[Hook]

[Nas]
We major? C'mon homey we major
We major? C'mon homey we major
We major! C'mon homey we major
We major! C'mon homey we major

[Verse 2: Nas]
I heard the beat and I ain't know what to write
First line should it be about the hoes or the ice?
Fo-fo's or Black Christ? Both flows'd be nice
Rap about big paper or the black man plight
At the studio console, asked my man to the right
What this verse sound like, should I freestyle or write?
He said, "Nas what the fans want is Illmatic, Stillmatic"
Looked at the pad and pen, fell, and jotted what I feel
Been like twelve years since a nigga first signed
Now I'm a free agent and I'm thinkin it's time
To build my very own Motown
Cause rappers be deprived, of executive 9 to 5's
And it hurts to see these companies be stealin the life
And I love to give my blood sweat and tears to the mic
So y'all copped the LP's and y'all fiends got dealt
I'm Jesse Jackson on the balcony when King got killed
I survived the livest niggas around
Last longer than more than half of you clowns
Look, I used to cook before I had the game took
Either way my change came like Sam Cooke

[Tony Williams]
Feeling better than I ever felt before today
Like better late than never is orientation
Still we can make it better throwing all your cares away

[Hook]

[Tony Williams]
Feeling better than I ever felt before today
But better late than never, it's
Orien-tation, still we can make it better
Throwin all your cares away

[Music starts to fade until 5:21 in the song]

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Can I talk my shit again?
Can I talk my shit again?!
I can't believe I'm back up in this muh'fucker
I'mma be late though
I gotta figure out what I'm gonna wear
Yeah... the Roc is definitely in the building
GOOD Music's definitely in the building
I gotta say what's up to Tony Williams
On the vocals sings, he sings quite beautifully
Don't you agree? Don't you agree?
Uhh, and Jon Brion on the keys right now
And Warren Campbell on the keys right now
So they ask me - why you call it Late Registration 'Ye?
Cause we takin these muh'fuckers back to school
If you know this part right here, feel free to sing along

[Outro: Tony Williams] + (Kanye West)
Feeling better than I ever felt before today (If you feelin good)
But better late than never; it's orien-tation (It's orientation)
Still we can make it better
Throwin all your cares away... (We want you to get used to this)

[Verse 1]
They say anything that is worth it you must take it slow
They know when you come around ain't no choice but to grow
Listen for what you say when I lay down my head
I don't know no other way but to let you have your way

[Pre-Chorus]
And no it don't always feel good
But yet, it all works for my good
You say I can take the burn blazing deep inside

[Chorus]
It's feels just like fire, fire caught up in my bones
Don't leave me alone, don't leave me alone
Oh my, my little light
I need to feel that heat come from your
Fire, fire caught up in my bones
Don't leave me alone, don't leave me alone
Just shine like stars in the night
We need to feel that heat come from your fire

[Verse 2]
Just like them boys Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego
I know when I come out the flames won't be smelling like smoke
Yup, that's just what you said, it went straight to my head
Remembering every day to let you have your way

[Pre-Chorus]
And no it don't always feel good
But yet, it all works for my good
You say I can take the burn blazing deep inside

[Chorus]
It's feels just like fire, fire caught up in my bones
Don't leave me alone, don't leave me alone
Oh my, my little light
I need to feel that heat come from your
Fire, fire caught up in my bones
Don't leave me alone, don't leave me alone
Just shine like stars in the night
We need to feel that heat come from your fire

[Bridge]
When your work is done, I'll be here shining bright
The pressure upon me, like diamonds in the sky
Turn into fire, I want to feel your fire
All over it fills me, Jesus you purify me

[Chorus x 3]
It's feels just like fire, fire caught up in my bones
Don't leave me alone, don't leave me alone
Oh my, my little light
I need to feel that heat come from your
Fire, fire caught up in my bones
Don't leave me alone, don't leave me alone
Just shine like stars in the night
We need to feel that heat come from your fireFreeDumb (Chains Off)

1st Verse
Loose women mixin' gin sinning
Played my cards wrong, I felt like I was winning'
Inning after inning, game after game, chain after chain
My jeweler was insane
Weighing my neck down trynna hold my head up
Fed up with the set up rumors they won't let up
Stuntin'  stuntin my growth
I saw no bridge but I did see a moat
Floatin' through the city couple pieces overlapping
Stones set perfect but really it was worthless
Never tucked wear my pride on my chest with no vest
Not stress,  runnin' around like Khaled
Like I'm the best, Like, not like the rest, Like
Press like if this flow should be under arrest Like
Blinded by the shine
Locked in the prison of my own mind
The Jesus piece now part of my rhyme, like

Chorus
When I took the Chain Off
[REPEAT]

2nd Verse
Linked up with the Cubans flew in two that was choosin'
The sound of the chains reacting was so soothin'
Real gold fake love, A sight for blind eyes
Kill yourself esteem with no glove
I had one and sometimes three at one time
I think I lived out every one of my rhymes
Not proud but I learned, if you don't take the chains off
One way or another brother, You will learn
Like KRS say, locked up mentally
If you seeking betterment I know that you feelin' me
Its love though, I don't judge I was once you
I'm still in the struggle make a choice what you gon do
Never crush a diamond in a piece, that's a don't do
24k overlay that's what I do
Keep it real, Naw homie keep it right
Security wanna check my chains before the flight like

Chorus
When I took the Chain Off
[REPEAT]

3rd Verse
I was the herringbone caught in that cashmere sweater
The Gucci link that's under that butter soft leather
The diamond link on top of the white tee
The cross that lay on my heart that protects me
Chain on my mind, Chain on my wrist
It's a chain of events that can change and eclipse
Ya spirit, I hear it in ya talk
You gettin' chase by the evils but you damn near caught
But don't do it! You gotta get free
You gotta see how unlocking ya brain is the key
No fee for your soul, you not a G cause you old
Wisdom begins when fear of God is the Mold
Heated in the furnace and bent into shape
When you polished and you shining you admitted in the gates, Enlightened by the shine
Locked in the prison of my own mind
The Jesus piece is now part of my rhyme like

Chorus
When I took the Chain Off
[REPEAT][Intro: Heavy D]

Hmmmmmmmmm!!!!!!! Na na na!!![Chorus:]
I know that you want my man
I know you been making plans
I know you wanna be me
You know it will never be

You thought you had be fooled
Thought I didn't have a clue
All along
I knew the truth
And now the joke's on you

[Verse 1:]
Don't think
That I don't see you looking
Cause it's so obvious
When you come around
That you wanna start blushing and touching

I see the way
That you're checking him
You must be outta mind to ever think
That he would wanna leave me

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 2:]
How long will you keep on trying?
You just keep on flirting
Trying to get him open

But it's all in game
Cause he ain't believing
Tell you what you should do
Find someone who wants you

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
I know you wanna be in my shoes
But you can't do
What I do
You'll never be the woman I am
And he's much too much man for you

Can you tell me why you want a man
That's already someone's man
Fix it
It's out of your hands
Time to stop this
Cause it's getting out of hand

[Repeat Chorus:][Snoop Dogg]
Yeah man, this is another 9 inch dick classic

Like you got your first freak
Backseat of the jeep on a late night creep
Like ooo
First time in the club when you getting some love
Shawty backing it up like ooo
It's like rolling one up
Real girls getting down and you throwing it up
It's like getting your girl in the v.i.p
First time with a fake i.d
Let me hit you like ooo

[Verse Two]
Ooo I gotta sexy wanna holla
On the flo' gettin closer
Like we supposed to ooo
Shawty by the end of the night
See if we ooo like we came to
It's gone be tight
She bout to ooo all over herself
I had to say ooo girl get control of yourself
She felt that ooo
When we bump and grind
See everything bout ooo is so fine

[Pre Chorus]


[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
No tell me how many thugs in the club
Got that ooo right there
Cause im looking at a ooo with a ooo
And she right here

[Pre Chorus]


[Chorus x2]
