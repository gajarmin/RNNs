[Verse One: Celeb Forever]
Prada luggage at the airport
All black Mazaratis when I land, nine cars already
I'm working on my tenth key
My watch shine turning niggas into Slick Rick, never let a bitch pimp me
Man, these hoes dying to get screwed nigga, Pimp C
But rest in peace Chad Butler and Aaliyah going 90 in an Aston
See you when I see you
Man, I met a girl yesterday, couldn't really keep up
Asked her who conditioned her
She said it was Tresemme
Asked her what her name was, she said it was Desiree
Put that Yeezy album in, she said she don't mess with 'Ye
I almost kicked her out but instead turned it up
Then I took her to the house, 15 minutes after lunch
What if we happen to kiss?
What if we happen to touch?
And we couldn't slow it down until enough had been enough
So she put back on her clothes acting like she in a rush
Said she not over her past and they just had broken up
Man I never get offended when they get back with they exes
Cause they need someone to Hold 'Em and I never been to Texas
Man
But my homie Boobie from out there
And he told me all women ain't the same
Probably cause he got Keisha, and it was nice to meet ya
But women, they tell the coldest lies, freezer
I just don't believe ya

[Verse Two: Donnis]
Show me what you here fo', show me what you here fo'
Take it all off, TSA, this the airport
Show that T&A, while I put it in the air ho
Ho...ho
I'mma make it rain dear/reindeer
Drop the mixtape and got signed in the same year
I relate to Vizzy baby, we got all the same things
Vizzy, Celeb Forever I just figured I'd make shit clear
The county nigga counting cash in some cashmere
My buzz light years/Buzz Lightyear ahead of y'all niggas
I heard Toy Stories told and seen them toys repoed
R.I.P. to C, all that liquor we poured?!
Trips to the coast but believe that we cold
Don't let the cars, girls, and boat shoes fool you
A slap to the face will have you feeling like a new you
Makeover if you will, if I make off with the mil
I'mma do the Madoff for the bill for real

[Verse Three: XV]
It always go, "I don't know your name, boy what song you sang?"
Call it cool, call it fame, I'll call you bluff and call it lame
I don't fuck with all the games, save that for the playoffs
Funny how my balls and chains got 'em going Adolf
Crazy
Then they take a glance and see how I do them tramps
Then focus on my mans, concentrating on my camp
Begging for the high life, even they man want my life
Guess I'm shining on son/sun, Edward on Twilight
High heels, high standards, high fashion, high price
Just to roll out with a nigga like the hot dice
Have her hitting high notes like all night
Kill that pussy, I don't give a fuck if it got nine lives
Then she around her friends and want to play pretend
Like, "What happened to your mans?
Oh yeah girl, we seen you."
And you be like, "We cool."
Man, I know I'm back at school, but I'm speaking for your crew
When we say we don't believe you
I don't believe you[Intro]
Phil Connors: I'm a god
Rita: You're God?
Phil: I'm a god, I'm not thee God. I don't think
Phil: Because you survived a car wreck?
Waitress: You folks ready to order?
Phil: I didn't just survive a wreck, I wasn't just blown up yesterday. I had been stabbed, shot, poisoned, frozen, hung, electrocuted and burned
Rita: Oh really?
Phil: Every morning, I wake up without a scratch on me, without a dent in the fender. I am an immortal

[Verse 1: Donnis]
They can’t get over my bars, they like an obstacle
I give ‘em to you in bulk, you know how Costco do
Shit, I came from Uncle Sam’s club
I know about landmines and why I am blowing up
Because these niggas keep stepping
And it ain’t in the name of love, see they'll be
Shooting at the clouds if they know your dreams above average
And you in the pursuit of happiness
They don’t want you to be Big Willie
Singing "welcome to Miami" down at Wet Willies
Haters need some TLC, uh, uh, no Chilli
Ain’t no love in the heart of the city
They showed us Chilly and uh, Gucci Mane say burr
And I have to concur with Mister LaFleur
With all this country shit they talking, I had to get on my grind
I ain’t have an option, career moving fast like an auction
One million, two million, three million, okay
Nigga sold his soul for a dollar and a dream
The dollar’s gone but the dream moving full steam
Talking Amtrak, went on a trip and back, gone was gone
But Atlantic still profit from that, so they put my life on the line
So I took my pen and pad and made a whole another design
But I can’t get my A&R on the line ‘cause the other rapper he signed
Started getting some shine like Shyne in ‘01 before he loaded up his gun
And I applaud him, phenomenal as I hide behind this tip like a Navajo
Listening to Outkast themes, wondering if my dreams belong on the big screen
‘Cause in the big scheme, they’re just a little thing so fuck famous
Let’s get legendary so all our mamas and sisters ain’t secretaries
‘Cause as of now, it look hereditaryChorus:
Come on boy, gimmie what you got, gimmie what you
Gimmie what you
Come on boy, gimmie what you got, gimmie what you
Gimmie what you
Come on boy, gimmie what you got, gimmie what you
Gimmie what you
Come on boy, gimmie what you got, gimmie what you
Gimmie what you

Hey, listen!
Come through and let a nigga put it down for you
Ever had a nigga send from out of town for you
Signs in that baggage claim,that read yo name
Just go with them in that lincoln car
Make sure they know who bitch you are...
When they drop you off at this 5 star
But it's general, in general I'm saying no
5 days, 4 nights, niggas ain't living that sort of life
Room service better get the order right
Nothing like summer time Florida nights
I live for live, so we do it bigger than last time
Doing it like it's our last time
Bottle poppin our past time
And it's past time for us to make it sexy
Though I know you in that dress
You know I'd rather see you naked singing

Chorus:
Come on boy, gimmie what you got, gimmie what you
Gimmie what you
Come on boy, gimmie what you got, gimmie what you
Gimmie what you
Come on boy, gimmie what you got, gimmie what you
Gimmie what you
Come on boy, gimmie what you got, gimmie what you
Gimmie what you

How you want it, on some new House of Balloons shit
Or just quite cause the music continues to be so useless
They can hear you loud and clear, ten four, ten four
Flight at 6 but Its already missed, cause I need an hour
And you gone need a shower
Cause you gotta check in, and your bags over weight
Spend another hour with the TSA
Cause your lost i.d. never got turned in
I feel like you gave it to one of your girlfriends
Right, cool I knew that, it's only right you do that
Cause that molly got you zooted
And now just wanna do it
Till yo next flight out to Houston or maybe you should stay here
Exchanging sexual favors 'till you're waking up the neighbors!
Singing
Chorus

Come on boy, gimmie what you got, gimmie what you
Gimmie what you
Come on boy, gimmie what you got, gimmie what you
Gimmie what you
Come on boy, gimmie what you got, gimmie what you
Gimmie what you
Come on boy, gimmie what you got, gimmie what you
Gimmie what you[Intro]
Riding around town shawty, doing my thing in my Ford Mustang
And my speakers bang, bang and my speakers bang, bang
Aye I’m just riding around town shawty, doing my thing in my Ford Mustang
And my speakers bang, bang and my speakers bang, bang

[Verse 1: Donnis]
Notorious for rolling B-I-G, my hustle grand
You ain’t see me out with T-I-P? You minimal, I max nigga, 3D
Push button TV, vintage whip, ‘63, six plus three sitting up under the seat
She six times three sitting next to me, if age ain’t nothing but a number
Better see an I.D or be gone for the Summer, speaking of Summer
Yeah I’m about to take that, these wheels cost me a fortune, Sajak
And my niggas gon’ find you, I chase money, I don’t need to remind you
Would chase bitches but ain’t never got the time to but I take some head
If she in the red like Piru, there’s some things I can’t avoid
She from a single mother home so I fill that void

[Hook]
When I’m riding around town shawty, doing my thing in my Ford Mustang
And my speakers bang, bang and my speakers bang, bang
Aye I’m just riding around town shawty, doing my thing in my Ford Mustang
And my speakers bang, bang and my speakers bang, bang

[Verse 2: Donnis]
Out sipping Pellegrino with my Filipino, about to hit the North Side
And see my nigga C-Note, gold chain tucked in, not they’re here to debo
Moving fast, put your ass from sixty to zero, neighborhood hero
South Side legend, see me riding, throw the deuces nigga, Ronald Reagan
Hit first gear, switch to second, hit tree sound, start up a session
Sounds to the beat, light up a swisher, niggas feel my 16’s like a child molester
Made me push your T on ‘em, gold chain made me Mr. T on ‘em
Yeah nigga, I am rolling with the A-Team, Academy, Pyramid Gang
They mad at me but I don’t hear a thing ‘cause my speakers just bang, bang, bang

[Hook]

[Bridge]
And I’m rocking and I’m rolling, ain’t no stopping ‘cause I’m going
Till the wheels fall off, till the wheels fall off
And I’m rocking and I’m rolling, ain’t no stopping ‘cause I’m going
Till the wheels fall off, till the wheels fall off

[Outro]
Aye I’m just riding around town shawty, doing my thing in my Ford Mustang
And my speakers bang, bang and my speakers bang, bang
Aye I’m just riding around town shawty, doing my thing in my Ford Mustang
And my speakers bang, bang and my speakers bang[Hook: Colin Munroe]
Don’t look back ‘cause we’re all like lightning
Here today, then we’re gone like lightning
Light up the sky and live for something
Everyone lives, only few become lightning
Don’t look back ‘cause we’re all like lightning
Here today, then we’re gone like lightning
Light up the sky and live for something
Everyone lives, only few become lightning

[Verse 1: Donnis]
If you stand for nothing, you’ll fall for it all, times is hard
These people is losing they jobs, my Homegirl Michelle out here
Losing her mom and nah, they ain’t got a cure for cancer
Her little sister looking up to me for answers
All I can do is sit her down and read her the pamphlet
But what I’m supposed to say when her mama just vanish?
Gone in an instant, God, if you hear this, I need your assistance
I wanna be different but all they wanna hear about is drugs and pimp shit
Who gon’ make a difference? I guess these niggas came with the wrong intentions
Manolo got fired, they ain’t give him his pension
Eight years out in Couveya, he played his position
And now he serving things just to make him a living
We here on a mission and it starts in the mirror, Lord, can you hear my prayer?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Donnis]
When I say this, some people may start to hate me
Scared to get a government money to get a Haiti
Saw what they did with FEMA, scared to be a believer
Donnis no longer rapper, nah, now I’d rather be teacher
The day I saw my preacher in a Phantom with security guards
He said what up Don? I just gave him a nod
Do we need all these things to get closer to God?
Then my Auntie Taj bought us Gucci ties, see, where she reside is where dreams die
And they don’t resurrect, they live in them projects
And them government projects don’t help ‘em the way you think
Sometimes I just think that they just want us to lose
I see how we depicted on the six o’clock news
They feed us drugs and booze until we dazed and confused
Damn, I refuse to become another statistic to get caught in the system

[Hook][Intro: Donnis]
Run for your life
Run from the light

[Hook: Priscilla Renea]
Constellations illuminate the sky-y-y-y
Dreams unheard and deferred I know why
I know why
Cause it gets starry eyed
In the Southern Lights
In the Southern Lights
Lights...
Lights...

[Verse 1: Donnis]
Back when every Friday's dinners was from Mrs. Winters
In Mrs. Williams' chorus class I was sangin' tenor
Tryna figure how a nigga get his paper up
I sold Blow-Pops, Moon Pies, and Kool-Aid Cups
Saddleton Middle School
Where we let children ridicule
Cause we thought we were really cool sippin' brews and skippin' school
Shit
Skip-parties was the lick
Young girls drop it low
Shakin' ass and hittin' splits
To the newest 3 6 song
"Slob On My Knob"
See were grown then
So now we act like kids
Ain't gotta tell us we ain't livin' right
But still survivin' every night in them Southern Lights
Every night in them Southern Lights
Still survivin' every night in them Southern Lights...

[Hook: Priscilla Renea]
Constellations illuminate the sky-y-y-y
Dreams unheard and deferred I know why
I know why
Cause it gets starry eyed
In the Southern Lights
In the Southern Lights
Lights...
Lights...

[Verse 2: Donnis]
????????? shoppin'
Bape diamond watch with the wristband option
Open face grill
Paid two-fifty for the bottoms
I'm awesome in that hatchback Honda
Goin' to see some bitches out in ???
Her momma don't mind if we cut so we need condoms
Black lifestyles, suburban white gal singin "Love in her mouth" She want love in her mouth
So I cum in her mouth
Surprised her parents even let us come in they house
Cuz them crosses still burnin' bright ever night
Out here, underneath them southern lights


Run for your life
Run from the light

[Hook (With Donnis talking in the background)]

This dream right here?
Hell, I pray so much about it I need some knee pads
Andre 3000 of the legendary Outkast

But, some nights I come home to high to pray
But I get on my back anyway, and meditate
Khujo Goodie of the legendary Goodie Mob

Shit...
You can pray all you want to
Not too many of us make it out of the...
Southern lights
The southern lights
Southern lights
Lights
Lights

(Chorus)
Best Days of our life, Best Days of our life
Best Days of our life, Best Days of our life
Best days, Days of our life, of our life

(Verse 1- XV)
Flight, so I’m red eyed
Nights on Jedi
Laying down flows, putting mics on bedtime
Give me my set time, and I’ma go rep mine
Bars on veg time, cars on red line
I be in the Palms hoping the Psychic that read mine
Was all the way right, no turning left signs
Tell them girls that this Don named Teflon
So you can touch me all you want, baby that’s fine
Grab a camera ain’t no telling what you finna see
With this boy from the 20th century
I told her I don’t have a photographic memory
So take a pic and give me pornographic memories
Imagination as long as minutes be
Now she on my linens sheets, F’ing me like Kennedy's
It’s a cold world, luckily I rented skis
Cameras out for the end of scene
This'll be the

(Chorus)

(Verse 2- XV)
Your man’s life bout as live as Ben Stein's
She wanna roll with a nerdy nigga that spits rhymes
Buzz so big you would think that I’ve been signed
I’m going big time, call it Big Ben time
Today’s it guy was the I.T. guy
Flow so vain, that they call them I.V. rhymes
Was in IB now, look where I be ma
Used to be posted on the corner like street signs
Wishing that my life’s TV had a rewind
But a screenshot would be fine
I know its gonna take me time to leave this hood behind
And turn that Nissan to a Car’s hood with a peace sign
Playa play on, Dookie rope chain on
Riding on my way home, Dookie by Green Day on
While ya’ll check ESPN for what game on
I’m taking a flick at what ya’ll laying on
This is called

(Chorus)

(Verse 3- Donnis)
Man I love this life, I can’t leave
I remember when my niggas used to make-believe
We took them dreams and mixed them with a little weed
And made a toast with a cup full of memories
And blackout like Akon and Black T
Haha, OD, OD
That’s what she’s saying when she got her hands on me
Way out here in Japan with 15 grand on me
I think she wanna fuck me
I mean she do but first she gotta learn to suck dick
So she gonna watch a girl blow me like a trumpet
I’m a Mac bitch, I stay on my Donald Trump shit
So these the best days ever
90 degree weather, shape up, no Sketchers
Hit me with Febreeze, I can’t get no fresher
I’m gonna think I’m on a bill, if I feel much better

(Chrous)[B.o.B - Verse 1]
Soon as I enter
You know who it is-a
It’s the representer from the east-side of Atlanta
That’s known as Decatur
I got my own lane, but I can’t see the road
My rear view mirror’s full of haters
Wouldn’t wanna be ya
It's me they cannot battle
Yes I’m a mothership and you a boat without no paddles
Yes I am what they after
I’m a natural born disaster
I’m the reason your momma tell you not hang with rappers
But your momma is a minister and I'm her favorite rapper
Probably cause she found out that my daddy was a pastor
I wonder what she’s after
But don’t get it confused
There's no surprise, it’s just another day in my shoes

[Hook]
Every other city we go
Every other city we go
It’s just a different day with the same shit
It’s just a different day with the same shit
Every other city we go
Every other city we go
Things just ain't what I used to know
Things just ain't what I used to know

[B.o.B - Verse 2]
Yeah, well these niggas salty
High blood pressure
Well if you got that sodium, nigga I got that pepper (Dr. Pepper)
Don’t step up, please fall back
Y’all can’t ball, all y’all are whack
Haters need hugs, you thugs need love
And groupies fall in holes that gold diggers dug
These niggas cynical cause I’m on that medicinal
Why they so sensitive? I guess they on their menstruals
I don’t need no, come consider the general
Regardless of my genre, yes, I’m flawless, man, in general
When I’m in the club
Girls be jigging on they tippy toes
So she take me in like her vitamins and minerals
You ain't on my signal, you analog or digital
Grand Hustle champion, someone turn my anthem on
When my jam come on, God damn I blow straight up
I am a bomb
Leaping over barriers like this was a triathlon

[Hook]
Every other city we go
Every other city we go
It’s just a different day with the same shit
It’s just a different day with the same shit
Every other city we go
Every other city we go
Things just ain't what I used to know
Things just ain't what I used to know

[Donnis - Verse 3]
Now I’m the everyday topic
Under a microscope so now I’m feeling microscopic
My shit was fading to black
Niggas thought I was gothic, but made it to the next step
Like recovering alcoholics
I bounce back like a Snoop Deville with hydraulics
Ain't "Nuthin' But A G Thang"
Nigga I’m the king of pain
Veins filled with Novocaine
So I ain't even feeling y’all
I ain't even hearing y’all
Fingernails on a blackboard
They say the pen is way mightier than the sword
So I’mma spaz out to get inside the mental ward
Then get my Grammy awards
'Til your faith is restored by the lord of this rap shit
Niggas got it backwards, let's line up all the factors
Grew up in the hood, but was raised in the 'burbs
Where pops wasn't there so the military made me a man
And they told me to put my dreams in the can
But I still made it here, damn!

[Hook]
Every other city we go
Every other city we go
It’s just a different day with the same shit
It’s just a different day with the same shit
Every other city we go
Every other city we go
Things just ain't what I used to know
Things just ain't what I used to know[Produced by The Awesome Sound]

(Chrous)[Verse: 1]

The education they give us seem to be minimal
Dont waste your time on them niggas they gon be criminals
And when they say it they mean it
Its so cruel and demeaning
What the fuck are they teaching?
As I sit here daydreaming about Lacresha
Light skin, long hair, all the right features
And then (beep beep) there go my nigga E beeper
Interrupt my dream, Interrupted class
Teacher confiscated damn thats my nigga ass
And not because of school
Its because rent is due by 2
And his momma got laid off so he trying to pull through
For the fam, do my teacher understand?
Naw.. cause she ain't never had it like that
She ain't never been young, wild and black
With the odds stacked forced to cop crack from the dopeman
To sit around a good meal and hold hands

[Hook:]
Blackberry molasses
One things that will never change
You gotta keep pushing on over the sun
It’s gonna be some hard they can pay/headache and pain

[Verse 2:]

9 year old me wants to be rapstar
25 year old me wants to run away far
Into the unknown
Started not give a fuck about no microphone
I spend my nights alone praying
Saying, "if I could get one hit, i'd stay far away from satan."
Till then ill be smoking and drinking
Porno-watching, five-finger discount shopping
Down that old that hill
Trying to make history and have a story to tell
My future daughter and son who have just begun to be thought about
But they ain't comin' til this rap working out
Im trying to figure how to get up out my momma house
Im on TV watching me from my momma couch
Feeling like time is running out
I think its time to re-route..[Intro]

I’m going in for the kill, I’m doing it for a thrill

Oh, I’m hoping you’ll understand and not let go of my hand

I’m going in for the kill, I’m doing it for a thrill

Oh, I’m hoping you’ll understand and not let go of my hand


[Verse 1: Donnis]

Fuck it, I’m going in, I play the game, I wanna win

I’m in the water, see my shark fin? Either you love me or you a guppy

Fuck me over, show no remorse, you dead to me, I see your corpse

Pour out the porks, preserve the wines, we pop the champagne

Once we cross the state lines, I’ll be damned if they take mine

‘Cause they inferior, I am superior like a great lake or a fat seat

And honestly, I gotta say I’m who they wanna be

That’s just the T-I-P of the iceberg, don’t like me?

I don’t give a four letter word, fuck, damn, shit

This Donnis, something you don’t wanna miss bitch


[La Roux]

We can fight our desires but when we start making fires

We get ever so hot whether we like it or we don’t


[Hook]


[Verse 2: Donnis]

Every verse I pin frees me from another demon, cursed with this curse

So my children are cursed, even the semen, yeah, this is just what I believe in

My ex girl still at home underachieving, mama found out I’m chiefing

And that’s just where it begin ‘cause I been popping these pills

They instantly make me feel like I’ll never know, never gon’ have to worry again

So that worries my friends, wait, I ain’t got friends ‘cause they was lame

And said the fame just wasn’t for them but I won’t hit a dead end

Nope, I keep on cruising and I kept on schmoozing while the game kept snoozing

This shit got confusing, see, they thought I’d be losing

Now I sit in amusement and watch them eat that betrayal

Motherfuckers be happy if my train slip and derail, I went in for the kill

Did it for all for the thrill, said they’d understand but they let go of my hand


[Hook]Chorus:
Come on boy, gimmie what you got, gimmie what you
Gimmie what you
Come on boy, gimmie what you got, gimmie what you
Gimmie what you
Come on boy, gimmie what you got, gimmie what you
Gimmie what you
Come on boy, gimmie what you got, gimmie what you
Gimmie what you

Hey, listen!
Come through and let a nigga put it down for you
Ever had a nigga send from out of town for you
Signs in that baggage claim,that read yo name
Just go with them in that lincoln car
Make sure they know who bitch you are...
When they drop you off at this 5 star
But it's general, in general I'm saying no
5 days, 4 nights, niggas ain't living that sort of life
Room service better get the order right
Nothing like summer time Florida nights
I live for live, so we do it bigger than last time
Doing it like it's our last time
Bottle poppin our past time
And it's past time for us to make it sexy
Though I know you in that dress
You know I'd rather see you naked singing

Chorus:
Come on boy, gimmie what you got, gimmie what you
Gimmie what you
Come on boy, gimmie what you got, gimmie what you
Gimmie what you
Come on boy, gimmie what you got, gimmie what you
Gimmie what you
Come on boy, gimmie what you got, gimmie what you
Gimmie what you

How you want it, on some new House of Balloons shit
Or just quite cause the music continues to be so useless
They can hear you loud and clear, ten four, ten four
Flight at 6 but Its already missed, cause I need an hour
And you gone need a shower
Cause you gotta check in, and your bags over weight
Spend another hour with the TSA
Cause your lost i.d. never got turned in
I feel like you gave it to one of your girlfriends
Right, cool I knew that, it's only right you do that
Cause that molly got you zooted
And now just wanna do it
Till yo next flight out to Houston or maybe you should stay here
Exchanging sexual favors 'till you're waking up the neighbors!
Singing
Chorus

Come on boy, gimmie what you got, gimmie what you
Gimmie what you
Come on boy, gimmie what you got, gimmie what you
Gimmie what you
Come on boy, gimmie what you got, gimmie what you
Gimmie what you
Come on boy, gimmie what you got, gimmie what you
Gimmie what youThey say we on

Lets get some green lets get some drink lets get it on
Say tonight we gonna get going going gone
Say tonight we gonna get going going gone
( get yo ass up baby get your ass up)

In the middle of the club blowin endo
Rolling up a swishers sweet, fat as Mr Winslow
Cause right now only family matters
And all these other niggers pissed cause they got little bladders
I came to shatter haters dreams kill they self esteem
Don't try to make it now my niggas this ain't maybelline
You have made it seem no body like me
And now I ain't gay so I don't care if niggas like me
Bitches know I'm cooler and I rock like Mikey
I, I, I rock things way out of your price range
We don't look at price tags never will never have
Just ask for they forgiveness later on
When you see my chick you see a chick that you will never have
And that's a concept you will never grasp
I'm the shit fertilizer in that greener grass
I'm bout to eat rama down watch these niggas fast
Now puff puff pass now and pour another glass

We on
Lets get some green lets get some drink lets get it on
Say tonight we gonna get going going gone
Say tonight we gonna get going going gone
( get yo ass up baby get your ass up)
Gone
Lets get some green lets get some drink lets get it on
Say tonight we gonna get going going gone
Say tonight we gonna get going going gone
( get your glass up baby get your ass up)

My momma asked me is the bragging really necessary
I say no but this shitt is gonna make me legendary
And I apologize for cussing, but when it come to rap I don't apologize for nothing
Disgusting nigga yuck to the maximum
These rap niggas rerun I'm yelling what's happening
Even if they get me they fucking with closed captioning
When you niggas dis me you ain't gettin no reaction
Cause emotions is for women and niggas who just be sittin when they pissin I ain't asking for permission
I'll just ask for they forgiveness later on
After I take the throne and bring it back to my home
No we on like the opposite of off, come from the same cloth
With TI get some Andre, Hov, and some Kanye
So how can they make saying Donnis ain't the illest where even the hottest niggas consider the boy a menace
Now we on

Gone
Lets get some green lets get some drink lets get it on
Say tonight we gonna get going going gone
Say tonight we gonna get going going gone
( get yo ass up baby get your ass up)
Gone
Lets get some green lets get some drink lets get it on
Say tonight we gonna get going going gone
Say tonight we gonna get going going gone
( get yo ass up baby get your ass up)[Hook: Colin Munroe]
I am me, as much as you may try, you could never be
If you step into my mind, then you'll see I am me, I am me, I am me

[Verse One: Donnis]
Not for nothing, I don't need no introduction
But now, I guess I'm just a fucking topic of discussion
Nobody gave me nothing, created my own sound
Created my own style, I am the A-Town
Where I'm at now? Niggas think they know me
And it's killing me so slowly, man, all these niggas phony
They got me ready to quit and I ain't drop the album yet
The real fans don't threat, I ain't stopping till I'm set
They hating is not a threat to the all amazing Donnis
Man, I'm just being honest, who know me better than me?
Who's seeing the things I see? I'll wait, let a nigga know
I ain't think so, man, these haters, they don't know

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Donnis]
All in all, I'm just a kid trying to get it in
By doing everything I can except for fitting in
Man, I'm sitting in a throne on my own
There ain't no competition, I'm alone in my zone
From a city where the kids is so accident prone
To call Jones Bureaux home is a fail loving song
And they don't understand that but show me where the map at
And I'll point out the zones where the niggas set the traps at
And when you grow around that, you gotta face found facts
You's a statistic but ain't no different from any other brother
Who made it out the gutter then show all them mother suckers
You know how to get them numbers

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Donnis]
In ’93, I chose the rhyme, that rhyme chose me
And in ’03, we almost had the whole deal
But watch this, yeah, I bet we get ‘em for the whole meal
They give me cold chills, just to think about all the shit I had done
Just to be number one, I missed more than one birthday or vacay
And I say if I could take it back, what I delay
I would ‘cause my family more important than the fortunes
‘Cause now I'm the captain of the plane
And if I turn around then all the shit’ll be in vain
So I'mma maintain my little altitude, I'm maintaining the attitude
Then keeping y'all first ‘cause this rap shit the worst, wassup?

[Hook][Produced by DJ Infamous]

[Verse One: Celeb Forever]
Prada luggage at the airport
All black Mazaratis when I land, nine cars already
I'm working on my tenth key
My watch shine turning niggas into Slick Rick, never let a bitch pimp me
Man, these hoes dying to get screwed nigga, Pimp C
But rest in peace Chad Butler and Aaliyah going 90 in an Aston
See you when I see you
Man, I met a girl yesterday, couldn't really keep up
Asked her who conditioned her
She said it was Tresemme
Asked her what her name was, she said it was Desiree
Put that Yeezy album in, she said she don't mess with 'Ye
I almost kicked her out but instead turned it up
Then I took her to the house, 15 minutes after lunch
What if we happen to kiss?
What if we happen to touch?
And we couldn't slow it down until enough had been enough
So she put back on her clothes acting like she in a rush
Said she not over her past and they just had broken up
Man I never get offended when they get back with they exes
Cause they need someone to Hold 'Em and I never been to Texas
Man
But my homie Boobie from out there
And he told me all women ain't the same
Probably cause he got Keisha, and it was nice to meet ya
But women, they tell the coldest lies, freezer
I just don't believe ya

[Verse Two: Donnis]
Show me what you here fo', show me what you here fo'
Take it all off, TSA, this the airport
Show that T&A, while I put it in the air ho
Ho...ho
I'mma make it rain dear/reindeer
Drop the mixtape and got signed in the same year
I relate to Vizzy baby, we got all the same things
Vizzy, Celeb Forever I just figured I'd make shit clear
The county nigga counting cash in some cashmere
My buzz light years/Buzz Lightyear ahead of y'all niggas
I heard Toy Stories told and seen them toys repoed
R.I.P. to C, all that liquor we poured?!
Trips to the coast but believe that we cold
Don't let the cars, girls, and boat shoes fool you
A slap to the face will have you feeling like a new you
Makeover if you will, if I make off with the mil
I'mma do the Madoff for the bill for real

[Verse Three: XV]
It always go, "I don't know your name, boy what song you sang?"
Call it cool, call it fame, I'll call you bluff and call it lame
I don't fuck with all the games, save that for the playoffs
Funny how my balls and chains got 'em going Adolf
Crazy
Then they take a glance and see how I do them tramps
Then focus on my mans, concentrating on my camp
Begging for the high life, even they man want my life
Guess I'm shining on son/sun, Edward on Twilight
High heels, high standards, high fashion, high price
Just to roll out with a nigga like the hot dice
Have her hitting high notes like all night
Kill that pussy, I don't give a fuck if it got nine lives
Then she around her friends and want to play pretend
Like, "What happened to your mans?
Oh yeah girl, we seen you."
And you be like, "We cool."
Man, I know I'm back at school, but I'm speaking for your crew
When we say we don't believe you
I don't believe you[Hook: Colin Munroe]
Don’t look back ‘cause we’re all like lightning
Here today, then we’re gone like lightning
Light up the sky and live for something
Everyone lives, only few become lightning
Don’t look back ‘cause we’re all like lightning
Here today, then we’re gone like lightning
Light up the sky and live for something
Everyone lives, only few become lightning

[Verse 1: Donnis]
If you stand for nothing, you’ll fall for it all, times is hard
These people is losing they jobs, my Homegirl Michelle out here
Losing her mom and nah, they ain’t got a cure for cancer
Her little sister looking up to me for answers
All I can do is sit her down and read her the pamphlet
But what I’m supposed to say when her mama just vanish?
Gone in an instant, God, if you hear this, I need your assistance
I wanna be different but all they wanna hear about is drugs and pimp shit
Who gon’ make a difference? I guess these niggas came with the wrong intentions
Manolo got fired, they ain’t give him his pension
Eight years out in Couveya, he played his position
And now he serving things just to make him a living
We here on a mission and it starts in the mirror, Lord, can you hear my prayer?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Donnis]
When I say this, some people may start to hate me
Scared to get a government money to get a Haiti
Saw what they did with FEMA, scared to be a believer
Donnis no longer rapper, nah, now I’d rather be teacher
The day I saw my preacher in a Phantom with security guards
He said what up Don? I just gave him a nod
Do we need all these things to get closer to God?
Then my Auntie Taj bought us Gucci ties, see, where she reside is where dreams die
And they don’t resurrect, they live in them projects
And them government projects don’t help ‘em the way you think
Sometimes I just think that they just want us to lose
I see how we depicted on the six o’clock news
They feed us drugs and booze until we dazed and confused
Damn, I refuse to become another statistic to get caught in the system

[Hook][Hook]
More fire, more fire, more fire, more fire
More fire, more fire, more fire, more fire
And we don’t need no water, let that motherfucker burn
No, we don’t need no water, let that motherfucker burn
No, we don’t need no water, let that motherfucker burn, burn motherfucker, burn

[Verse 1: Donnis]
Donnis, I’m exactly what a don is
Boy, I stand behind my bars like a convict
And every time I spit a verse, you reminded
Why Atlantic signed it and why you never signed shit
Nigga, what I’m about to drop is timeless
Like a nigga who just lost his Timex, I’m next, no others, Southern
I swear my teachers said I’d never be nothing but fuck ‘em
‘Cause I’m coming so tell them hoes to open wide
I’m on a star track, welcome to the enterprise
I swear the rise is making me less humble
My mama said she don’t like me but she love ’cause she supposed to
I got a father that I ain’t ever spoke to, watch your boys turn bitches to raw food
But on the up and up, these hoes wanna come through
And everything’s fabulous and I ain’t even got a clue what to do but bring they ass…

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Donnis]
Look, little nigga, you are number two
And that don’t mean that you the shit nigga, get a clue
‘Cause I'mma kill it with a dagger and a diamond boo
So tell Professor Plum and other rappers they done
Yup, I’m on a mission for the title like my bitch
But I ain’t talking nothing bridal, Alfred Hitchcock
I’m about to go psycho while y’all keep playing, Tyco
Top ten, double XL don’t make typos
You ate last year but now you about to see lipo
I nip tuck it and then take all of your duckets
And spend it down in Vegas on weed, booze and luggage
Bitches to rub and tug it ‘cause I love a happy ending
No Disney, don’t kid me ‘cause down here in the South
We bear arms like a grizzly, believe it or not Mr. Ripley
Simply, I only came to do one thing and that’s bring…

[Hook][Hook]
I think it’s time that you move on, somebody tell these niggas that it’s over
So pack it up and then move on, this time around, it’s only getting colder
Shorty, sit your ass down, shorty, sit your ass down
You had your run, you had your run and now you’re done
I think it’s time that you move on, somebody tell these niggas that it’s over

[Verse 1: Donnis]
Aye, aye, aye keep it moving shorty, ain’t nothing to see here
But see that you are closer to the bottom than may appear
You think that everybody know your name, boy, this ain’t Cheers
We’ll take your little spot, this here is musical chairs when the music stop
We back to the block so we don’t care about your chain or that little car you got
Failure’s not an option, it’s more a promise for these other niggas
Surely that can’t be for Donnis, yeah, that’s for whatchmacallit
Spitting them candy bars, niggas’ minds is on Mars
I can hear you haters snickering, giggling, lonely, I live close
You so Gilligan and I’m so fly, I’m on top of my shit again
Thank you very much, your ship set sail and then it sunk
In memory of you, we pop bottles and light blunts, I lied, no we don’t
You just another pussy rapper gone, until you are, we dedicate this song

[Hook]

[Verse 2: XV]
I get going when I go in, got bad bitches on my groin
Oh, you and that girl go out, so? Why she about to go into that whip that I be rolling
While video game controlling? She posted up like she posing
My Lindsey but no Lohan and my flow is Grey’s Anatomy
For slow ones, man, I body it, I’m on my Konami shit
One inch punch karate kicks, see my way like lobbyists or Gotti’s kids
In all honest-ness, I’m quiet as a mouse with my modest-ness
So catch up like a condiment, you don’t know my accomplishments
Taking over villages, burning down cottages
Selling out venues and panty raiding at colleges
Playing Raiden on Mortal Kombat ain’t even as shocking as this
Vizzy here, busy year, we raising our toasts
Up in that bread like raisins in toast, losing, I don’t do that, I been here
How could I move back to that city that I move at? You new cats, I think that…

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Donnis]
See, many men get fifty cent and think they got a dollar
I say they should see Dre or any other doctor
To prescribe they ass some medicine if they think they better than
My sign’s always greater than, there can’t be no equal
Yup, or a lesser evil, I dare devils to come test me
I am so Evil Kenevil, vroom, way above you niggas
I am married to the game, you got wedding day jitters
She got jive, breasts and thighs, I only fuck with Misses Winners
Nah, I don’t fuck with chicken head hoes, higher education
But know how to drop it low, keep that Libra balance
Fuck me like a Scorpio, all I do is win according to my horoscope
Yeah, we in the building, get with the program and stop being a doorman dom, man
I built it ground up, copy the floor plan, you already copied the flow, damn

[Hook][Verse 1: Donnis]
I drop one hit and look at me, I'm on
See, right now I'm here but later on, I'm gone
Tonight it's LA, tomorrow I'm in Toronto
Backstage champagne, hoes getting low-low
But just last week, I wasn't the one they would go for
Looking at these people like who the fuck do I know-know?
Man, I stay surrounded by strangers who don't care about me
They only care about the paper, care about the hits, they don't care if I exist
This game is so shitty, it'll eat ya alive, I ain't even got no time
To kiss my mama goodbye, give my pops a hi-five, look at how time flies
Luckily God's the pilot, I'm just here for the ride, flying first class
Looking through the glass wondering who gonna love me
If I ever start plummeting from forty thousand feet, just me and my ecstasy, let's see

[Hook: Tony Williams]
One last coffee, one last breath and one last cigarette
And I'm outta here, say I'm outta here
One last coffee, one last breath and one last cigarette
And I'm outta here, say I'm outta here

[Verse 2: Donnis]
Girl, you were supposed to be my chick, lover and best friend
So I already tell you but right here is where the bet ends
You lost a best man, no Taye Diggs, you fine
I see why he wanna make you his, I love your mind
And that's why I wanna make you mine but you wasting time
‘Cause right now, you think he better, no, you see me making calls
No, you see me sending letters, threw away all your pictures
Instead of trying to picture something that’s picture perfect
See, I don't see the purpose in chasing and playing games
You already knew my aim, you the only girl I claim
See, now you should be ashamed ‘cause through the tears and pain
I'm the one who still remain, you complain, I made it better
The world was cold, I was your sweater but now you gotta face
The weather all alone cause together and forever is forever postponed

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Donnis]
Climbing to the top, getting to that next level shit
Fuck my old miss, I'm on my rebel shit
I say for whether that, I said hello to Rich
I say goodbye to haters and said hello to chips
Ain't a problem that I can't fix, I just wash my hands for shit
I planned for this, they gonna try shoot me down, I crash landed this
And walked away without a scratch, I ain't even react
In the past, I said some things that I can never take back
So now, I just relax and tell them haters take that, even when I collapse
I'm collapsing as a God, never ever will remember my memoirs

[Hook][Verse One: Donnis]
They don't wanna give it to me, okay fine, I take it
My mama told me that this life is only what you make it
So I don't wanna flow no more, I'mma overflow
And do the type of shit that get her front row at the Oprah show
Talking about how she raised a legend, not John though
Just a Don though would flow like lava and I protect this shit
Like it's my twelve year old daughter cause these niggas is predators
With they little metaphors, what that even matter for?
Donnis is a matador, andale, andale, spring up on these niggas like April, May
They would say Donnis so hot but how we gon' break 'em?
See, that's the problem, see, you labels can't break 'em
I'm eating niggas' dreams and I'm shitting inspiration
Donnis bring fire like cavemen, thank him
Ain't no more patience, I'm sick and tired of waiting

[Hook]
Don't make me do it to you shorty cause I over do it
Don't make me do it to 'em shorty cause I over do it
Don't make me do it to you shorty cause I over do it
So you don't confuse this for just rap music
I want one million, two million, three million, four
I want one million, two million, three million, more
If we make it to the top, catch 'em sleeping on the floor
They wouldn't let us in, now we kicking in the door

[Verse Two: Donnis]
Blackout and I wish that my life would end
Sick of dreaming of this shit, nigga I wanted in
Imaginary friends, imaginary ends, imaginary Benz, I imagined it
And here the fuck it is, how I got this shit?
Don't think, imagine it, damn that boy so passionate
It's like it's happening right before your eyes
All them nights I died and all them nights I cried
Cause job wouldn't take 'em, effort wouldn't take 'em
Labels wouldn't take 'em and now I'm about to take 'em
For like everything they got cause now I got the slot
Jackpot, nigga Vegas, we took this as a lesson
We wondered how we'd come up, the game tried to check us
And now we about to come up and now we about to run up the bill
And make these niggas pay for this meal, I'm eating but I really want the mill yeah

[Hook][Intro]
Phil Connors: I'm a god
Rita: You're God?
Phil: I'm a god, I'm not thee God. I don't think
Phil: Because you survived a car wreck?
Waitress: You folks ready to order?
Phil: I didn't just survive a wreck, I wasn't just blown up yesterday. I had been stabbed, shot, poisoned, frozen, hung, electrocuted and burned
Rita: Oh really?
Phil: Every morning, I wake up without a scratch on me, without a dent in the fender. I am an immortal

[Verse 1: Donnis]
They can’t get over my bars, they like an obstacle
I give ‘em to you in bulk, you know how Costco do
Shit, I came from Uncle Sam’s club
I know about landmines and why I am blowing up
Because these niggas keep stepping
And it ain’t in the name of love, see they'll be
Shooting at the clouds if they know your dreams above average
And you in the pursuit of happiness
They don’t want you to be Big Willie
Singing "welcome to Miami" down at Wet Willies
Haters need some TLC, uh, uh, no Chilli
Ain’t no love in the heart of the city
They showed us Chilly and uh, Gucci Mane say burr
And I have to concur with Mister LaFleur
With all this country shit they talking, I had to get on my grind
I ain’t have an option, career moving fast like an auction
One million, two million, three million, okay
Nigga sold his soul for a dollar and a dream
The dollar’s gone but the dream moving full steam
Talking Amtrak, went on a trip and back, gone was gone
But Atlantic still profit from that, so they put my life on the line
So I took my pen and pad and made a whole another design
But I can’t get my A&R on the line ‘cause the other rapper he signed
Started getting some shine like Shyne in ‘01 before he loaded up his gun
And I applaud him, phenomenal as I hide behind this tip like a Navajo
Listening to Outkast themes, wondering if my dreams belong on the big screen
‘Cause in the big scheme, they’re just a little thing so fuck famous
Let’s get legendary so all our mamas and sisters ain’t secretaries
‘Cause as of now, it look hereditary[Hook - Cyhi Da Prince]
I got ray ban vision, these ain’t no prescriptions
I see you haters coming niggers Don't Think that im slipping
I got ray ban vision, I wear when I’m whipping
I wear when I’m fucking all my women think I’m trippin
I got ray ban vision X 5
This how I’m living, the only time I’m looking you in the eye if we do in bussiness
I got ray ban vision

[Verse 1 : Donnis]
Hey I got Ray Ban vision, my bitches think they prescription
I’m lookin’ fly as fuck, like a GQ subscription
You can’t see behind them when niggas know that I’m quitin’
Cause I’m going on top sour diesel that’s as a lemon, lemon
No nigger, no this ain’t no Gucci shit, wearing with my Louie shit
And I got a groupie bitch, who wear him with her Gucci shit
She swear that I’m stupid rich cause I got all these ray ban flavors
But I favor my all black darth vader
I rock them when I’m blockin’ haters
In something tailored
Yes I’m looking dapper if you are inquiring
But don’t ask me where I get them, when your paid you acquire things
I spend high notes like a high school choir scenes
That had them admiring, thinking that their style needs firing, damn
I ain’t mean to get your fired off some fresh shit
But my collection’s quite impressive

[Hook]

[Verse 2 : Pill]
I got my black shades on, Ray Ban on the side
Lets hit the bat cave home, Bruce Wayne when I ride
So those who robbing, you know I got the carbon
15 like half of 30 leave 'em slaughtered
Don’t mean to brag but my black shade’s fresher
Harder than then an all marble dresser
Yes sir, I am the professor the teacher of all cool shit
Bitches like he look like somebody I went to school with
Lenses, blackout, benze to crack house and everybody keep trying to buy ya like Shaq's house
Oki-ni, I put my foot out in this outfit, and Ray Bans is something I gotta leave the house with

[Hook]

[Verse 3 : Danny Brown]
Ray ban vision, can you see me mami?
Making bitches out of paper like origami
Pussy on tsunami, they slaught a salami
The bitches pussy kicking like I heard a march of Nazi's
I get hand me down shirts from Liberace
You kiss bitches thats in to Bukake
And they modern day ferrow? Quick bow and arrows
That shoots sparrows in a 3 six barrels
Like we have your tongue when at time and yells at Christmas carol
I fuck bitches out of America Apparel
So they hit me to skeet skeet and get drugged out and your weed got seeds like a major league dugout
Smoke two blunts, drink a Pabst Blue Ribbon
Now she call that cab and her fucking panties missing
When she hit the door there was no kissing
Never see me again, I got ray ban vision![Hook] [Mike Posner]:
Roll the windows up when you get in the car, and I'mma light one up
Hit the gas station go and buy a cigar and a philly blunt
Every time I breathe it's like I'm taking a puff, turn my music high
Roll the windows up, when I smoke and drive

[Verse One] [Big Sean]:
All black car (car)
Three percent tint
I can clearly see out
But you can barely see in
The end and only end
We blowing Indo-nesia
And I'm a let it hit til I get amnesia
I'm crazy the haze got me hazy I'm lazy
Tell Ben that it Something About Mary and clearly (what)
I'm so outta here you can say a nigga spacey (damn)
Pocket full of papers so I'm finnin to get some papers (yeah)
Bout to inhale like I'm finnin to see Satan (what)
Bout to exhale like I'm finnin to see my savior
So get the leaves and trees like it's autumn
Have them windows all rolled up rolled em and told em man

[Hook]

[Verse Two] [Donnis]:
First of all til you ball like this
You don't put this type of piff in your swish
Get it?
We smoking on that Poison call it Michael Bivins
So if you selling to me then you gotta lucrative business
A friend is what you blow while I'm smoking on that CEO
Top notch I got fruit by the foot in my fruit roll up
No cuts no stems no seeds straight THC indeed
I'm tryna get stoned like I stared into Medusa eyes
You ain't got green what somebody tell me who supply
So I can buy wholesale for the low like Cosco or Sams
You got some? Well damn!

[Hook]

[Verse Three] [Jackie Chain]:
I don't smoke phillies pass me a swisher
Bumping Pimp C pouring out a little liquor
Trunk full of kicker blunt full of OG
Right behind tint cause these jack boys know me
Smokin' sour diesel out of NYC
Keisha Cole in ATL Obama kush in DC
Which ones better? Roll up I need a tie breaker
Take a ride downtown man I'm higher than these sky scapers
Roll the windows up tryna get my smoke on
Two in the morning still riding with my locs on
Fuck the police what these pigs gon' tell me?
Smoking bud at lights like X off of Belly
[Hook][Hook: Brandon Hines]
Never really been good at expressing myself so I chose to write you a song
All the times that we had, good and the bad, I never meant to do you wrong
So I made a song for every ex, song for every ex, song for every ex that I have
So I made a song for every ex, song for every ex, song for every ex that I have

[Verse One: Donnis]
This song is for my exes, not to be specific
Ain’t asking for forgiveness, just take a minute, listen
Envision what this could be, what this would be if you and me could just see eye to eye
And why we broke up? I don’t really know why
And do I want it back? I ain’t even gon' lie, nah, I ain’t even gon' lie
Not a day goes by I ain’t thinking bout you or trying to come through
But you can do you and I'mma do me cause truthfully ain’t no nigga cool as me
But missing how we used to be, I’m missing how we used to be

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Donnis]
And I don’t wanna fuck every girl in the world, no, not every girl in the world
No, wherever I may be in the world, if we been there right, then I care
Cause I'm reminded of you and if what mama tell me about timing is true
It’ll all come back or I’ll fall back cause you’ll call back
But take it from me, I’m all outta tears, they drown in the biz so no more the biz
And I don’t mean to treat you different cause baby you so significant
But I’m no longer interested, no I’m no longer interested

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Donnis]
If you listening now, I apologize, ain’t here to point fingers
Ain’t here to tell lies, it’s the way that I feel inside that drives me insane
On days like this so I get high, then I feel low and I don’t know which way to go
So I send texts to you, make calls and I run game and you won’t fall for that
Say your new man ain’t all of that but you say he treats you nice
But I’m the one who did everything you like and if you leave him now
It just wouldn’t be right so you stay there and I'mma hold tight
And I'mma wait for them blocked calls at night and I'mma wait for them blocked calls at night

[Hook][Intro: Donnis]
Run for your life
Run from the light

[Hook: Priscilla Renea]
Constellations illuminate the sky-y-y-y
Dreams unheard and deferred I know why
I know why
Cause it gets starry eyed
In the Southern Lights
In the Southern Lights
Lights...
Lights...

[Verse 1: Donnis]
Back when every Friday's dinners was from Mrs. Winters
In Mrs. Williams' chorus class I was sangin' tenor
Tryna figure how a nigga get his paper up
I sold Blow-Pops, Moon Pies, and Kool-Aid Cups
Saddleton Middle School
Where we let children ridicule
Cause we thought we were really cool sippin' brews and skippin' school
Shit
Skip-parties was the lick
Young girls drop it low
Shakin' ass and hittin' splits
To the newest 3 6 song
"Slob On My Knob"
See were grown then
So now we act like kids
Ain't gotta tell us we ain't livin' right
But still survivin' every night in them Southern Lights
Every night in them Southern Lights
Still survivin' every night in them Southern Lights...

[Hook: Priscilla Renea]
Constellations illuminate the sky-y-y-y
Dreams unheard and deferred I know why
I know why
Cause it gets starry eyed
In the Southern Lights
In the Southern Lights
Lights...
Lights...

[Verse 2: Donnis]
????????? shoppin'
Bape diamond watch with the wristband option
Open face grill
Paid two-fifty for the bottoms
I'm awesome in that hatchback Honda
Goin' to see some bitches out in ???
Her momma don't mind if we cut so we need condoms
Black lifestyles, suburban white gal singin "Love in her mouth" She want love in her mouth
So I cum in her mouth
Surprised her parents even let us come in they house
Cuz them crosses still burnin' bright ever night
Out here, underneath them southern lights


Run for your life
Run from the light

[Hook (With Donnis talking in the background)]

This dream right here?
Hell, I pray so much about it I need some knee pads
Andre 3000 of the legendary Outkast

But, some nights I come home to high to pray
But I get on my back anyway, and meditate
Khujo Goodie of the legendary Goodie Mob

Shit...
You can pray all you want to
Not too many of us make it out of the...
Southern lights
The southern lights
Southern lights
Lights
Lights
Lights....[Donnis]
I’m so drunk off the lifestyle, high off this little fame
Money changed everything, I will never be the same, I’m trying to maintain
But I’m moving so fast that I’m swerving into your lane
All gassed up my nigga, yeah it’s propane
‘Cause my idols say I’m dope nigga, cocaine
I keep a bad Asian bitch, get lo mien along the egg roll and the testicles
They all know they want some fun, young guy
And if they got that Mary J, they know I will oblige
Haters on the increase as I am on the rise
Though it’s hard to hear you niggas when I’m way up in the sky
No G4 nor G5, go to first class A.K.A skipping class
Just to step out with the academy, scholars
It only makes sense, we the ones with the dollars
Keep your bitch on a collar and please don’t let her loose
She wanna hang, no noose, KKK, it’s so posse for me to say I’m the best
Though it looks that way, all I did was pray, knees got swollen
Window got closed and the door bust open, ram
Now I’m in this bitch, straight up it’s my time, yeah the clock say six
They can say what they want, throw stones, throw sticks
When you a star, you just prone to this, I’m alone in this
Yup and you can see my insecurity, that’s why I got the jewelry
The shine is so new to me, why I need the money? The cars? The clothes?
Pussy rule the world, I just do it for the hoes
I tell her how it is, the cons, the pros, the hate, the love, the highs, the lows
Little nigga balling, man I’m Muggsy Bogues
Yeah I’m playing for the ring, it’s funny ‘cause my girl playing for the same thing
She tell me that she love me, I don’t know what that mean
Especially since now I’m on that Hollywood scene
Where everything’s illusion but everything I dreamed
This is my movie scene, I promise I'mma kill it, yeah
I promise I'mma kill it until I tell them niggas roll the credits
