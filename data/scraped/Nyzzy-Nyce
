(Hook x4)
I've been grinding my whole life
Tryna make it out this gutter
Hustling like no other
Stand on this bread like butter

(Verse)
I've been grinding my whole life
Just a young nigga tryna get by
Got them haters still running their mouth
But I ain't mad, cause them numbers don't lie
I've got kush roll'd up right now
I can take you to a place in the sky
Hurricane got the streets on fire
You can see that pain, will you look into my eyes?
Ain't no telling' what I got in this cup
Thank God everyday I wake up!
Got a bad bitch, no make-up
Dick good, she don't wanna break up
I been putting in work on muff
OG's respect my huff
Party's cap, thuggers in my duff
I'mma need a champagne by the walking Gaza
See, real niggas move in silence
Bitch niggas always talking
See, I'm so fresh, 'til death
I can fuck me a bitch in a coffin
23s in my feet, I'm walking
I can lap you niggas when I'm jogging
I swear, this money keep calling
It won't be long 'til a nigga just ballin'
Can't wait 'til I'm in that Maybach
And my bank account full of them racks
Got bitches in my face, like gnats
If you're getting cheese, gotta watch them rats
I'dda make me so much, but I'm still tryna stack these bots
Niggas tryna talk us down, but we ain't ever gave no fuck

(Hook x4)
I've been grinding my whole life
Tryna make it out this gutter
Hustling like no other
Stand on this bread like butter

(Verse)(Moe Cheez)
What's yo' life up in my lifetime?! I grind, nigga!
Take a late night call from my momma telling me she'll be fine, nigga
I'll pass that, bitching up the numbers like nas that
Don't, not allowed, but I pass that
Only rags to riches where the cash at
Cause I need things and I got dreams
My whole life I'dn pray for the same dreams
My whole life I've been enslaved fo'
And I'm just tryna make it out the gutter
I ain't out here on my own, I'm tryna make it for my brother
Cause these hard times, they getting harder
And these bitch niggas, they gettin' smarter
They say I'm tryna live, I been grinding all my life
Niggas, something's gotta give (nigga!)
Before they get me wid my hand out
I'll be back on the block with my hand out
Grind hard, that's what I did, nigga
Cause I was taught to get it how you live, nigga![Intro]
Man, fuck back then

(x2)

[Verse 1]
Man, fuck back then we're the shit right now
Got all these haters on my dick right now
If I had Cristal I'd take a sip right now
Cause money over everything is how I get down
Take a bad bitch on a shopping spree
Yelling out "olly olly oxen free"
That's why your girl's still steady jocking me
Cause you a lame nigger trying to copy me
Keep your mind on your money not me nigger
You're only good for wrapping when it's Christmas niggas
The infant up in a misfit in an instant
I'll be getting Gs like Irisbus nigga
When it comes to beats I'm a serial killer
Real dope spitter, swags still iller
Fuck a fake nigger cause I'm so real-uh
Ya, fuck a fake nigger cause I'm so real-uh

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Ain't never gonna to stop and that's what it's gonna be
All these little niggers want to be like me
Rocking some coats and a V like me
Get a bad jigger keep it G like me
It don't come easy, take work my nigga
Grind all the time till it hurt my nigga
He mad cause his girl just want to flirt my nigga
So fall back there looking like a jerk my nigga
And don't want nobody like this tattooed nigga
Cause after he pays for them tattoos nigga
Now I go nuts like a cashew nigga
I ain't never looking back cause I'm past you nigga
Old Gs do my grafics
And double Ms do my videos
And Double K, that's my DJ
And we're still running shit like relays
(Unintellagable)
It'ld take to long to nail my chicks
There's a formula to be me
But it won't work nigga, you're not me
Ya, there's a formula to be me
But it won't work nigga, you're not me
It won't work nigga, you're not me, ya

I said I'm tatted up don't make me take my shirt off
Pull up on that pussy like I'm finna park in it
She said its wet but she ain't never had a shark in it
Had to cop a Louis belt just to feel right
Obama off a molly when I feel light

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Get rich or die trying, like 50 Cent
I'm just a young gunner tryna get that 50 bread
Hurricane Gang bitch, that's whats up
Thats why we got a bottle boy and you got a cup
Signing autographs now they claim they talking to ya
Swear they praise a nigger now, Hallelujah
They said the cops coming, better put them drugs up
They said the cops coming, better put them drugs up
Everything's brand new its like I got a genie
They gone hate it when a nigger get that Lamborghini
Fuck a duffle bag boy, I need a money counter

If success them shoes must fit it
Can't climb to the top cause the sky's no limit
Don't care about much, but smoke
Stay high forever? Yeah, that be dope
Capricorn so that means I'll be G.O.A.T
There goes another fifth down my throat
Man, I got problems
And this little green bud just solves 'em
So crazy what could cause 'em
Make me wanna shit on all em
Life's ups and downs, and damn
Ain't that a bumpy road to travel?
I had nightmares of me, getting lost in all the shadows

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I know some niggas probably want me dead
What goes on in his crazy head?
Heart gone stop before a tear gets shead
Peanut butter, jam how I'm on that bread
These people wanna see me change
But I get change, man, fuck these people
I know God didn't make me evil
I'mma be heavenly for my sequel
And man (man)

To make it out, that's the plan
And I don't give a damn

[Hook](x2)[Nyzzy Nyce]

It's been a long year...
I never imagined it would be like this but...
Somtimes you just gotta keep going... yeah!

[Chorus]
The whole world know I'm doing my thang
Sitting V.I.P just to sip champagne
Now I feel like a superstar
Now I feel like a superstar
Now in every city they be yelling my name
Late night flights that's spending on a plane
Now I feel like a superstar
Now I feel like a superstar

[Verse 1: Nyzzy Nyce]
Waking up, with my mind gone
Just tryna figure out where all this times gone
Late night flights, switching time zones
All these dudes falling off like some pinecones
Some camel shorts, and some striped socks
Been locked up once so I don't like cops
I'm a different breed, feel like I'm cyclops
All I need is some red bull and some eye drops
I bet some people never thought I would make it here
Im tatted up, I never thought I'd take it there
Bone crusher blood boy, I'm never scared
And now people showing love, that never cared
But I guess, thats how life goes
Just making sure I'm heading down the right road
Swear they can't see me, blind folds
And I'm a go hard until the day my eyes close

[Chorus]
The whole world know I'm doing my thang
Sitting V.I.P just to sip champagne
Now I feel like a superstar
Now I feel like a superstar
Now in every city they be yelling my name
Late night flights that's spending on a plane
Now I feel like a superstar
Now I feel like a superstar

[Verse 2: Nyzzy Nyce]
Step up on the stage, them girls yelling for me
Tryna do right, the devil dwelling for me
Shout out to my phone, it do the spelling for me
And to all the fans, the story tell it for me
We on are way up, we on are way up
Tank top and a fitted stay laced up
And my body full of ink from the waist up
Like everyday my birthday, I'm caked up
And I swear to God, I love this life
That's why I'm doing the same stuff every night
When you a superstar, these people get polite
I promise this champagne got me feeling right
And I wouldn't give this up for anything
Finally I made it into the hall of fame
And I stay on point, like a shark fang
I swear this the only song my heart sang

The whole world know I'm doing my thang
Sitting V.I.P just to sip champagne
Now I feel like a superstar
Now I feel like a superstar
Now in every city they be yelling my name
Late night flights that's spending on a plane
Now I feel like a superstar
Now I feel like a superstar

So no matter what they say
Just know you a star
Just know you a star
So no matter what they say
Just know you a star
Just know you a star

The whole world know I'm doing my thang
