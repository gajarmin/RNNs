[Verse 1 - Akil]
Yo, my metaphor, my musical madness
Move and motivate those with musical talents, uhh
Read it in bold print, we holdin it down
Lick a shot, hip-hop when we in yo' town
Uhh, master blaster sound
Freak the future far from here and now
With style, release increase the peace, uhh
Bubble with the beat 'til they feelin the heat in the streets
Now each one, teach one, reach one, young gun
On one, listen to the warrior's drum
Beatin up the block with the ghetto hop that knock
And make you wanna crash the spot
And unlock explode (BOOM) the alpha and omega code
With drum rolls and old soul, we uphold
And foretold to scores of six years ago
Fast flow from G. Rap to Kool Moe
Supasyllable, major to the minimal
Every individual, bounce to the tempo yo
Lungs collapse and raps be trapped in
The only way to make it happen, jaw-jappin, fast rappin

[Verse 2 - Zaakir]
Yo, I'm the hot dog that run the hottest monologue
In star poetic inserts and yes y'all s
My speech is like holding two Glocks apiece
The outreach that rock police
The super adventure men portend to put somethin in bitches
Win when we write, the Emmy winner get hyped, off any printer
And I came to get it (HIT IT)
Like Operation PUSH, operate the tush
Black octopus of soul, in inter-planetary patrol
I planted my gold, and low and behold
It's the brother doc, ready to rock-rock
Don't stop Hobbes, I'm hot like the lumberjack chop chop
The wordsmith, I write in block letters of cursive
Curse my circus, serve this surface
And watch how the brother get over
The fly Cassanova with the frankincense odor

[Verse 3 - Percee P]
Bear witness
To where riches'll make career bitches share pictures
When the ears get this ya brain's software'll glitch
Splatter your brains
Leave scattered remains of matter and stains
That'll explain how you was battled and slain
I get rude and go, to your show and use a row
Of fans to BOO and throw you off 'til you lose your flow
A pro, mean like Joe Greene when I blow theme
Put your whole team on pause like cold cream
Then show laughter when I flow faster, your ho have ta
Go after her weave from the breeze when I blow past ya
I'm dapper plus ghetto and just pedal
When the dust settles we left in the rubble the crushed metal
Nurses with hearses sealin conversed with lit purses
Spit fire, make you first to bit, try me
Like Osama, or Dahmer', I'mma cause trauma
And homicides when I collide I get kamikaze

[Verse 4 - Big Daddy Kane]
Kane baby, walk hard, the p-jects
On streets of Brooklyn I'm a crew of D-cepts
On streets of L.A. I'm a whole E-set
On tracks with Jurassic I be the T-Rex
Still that Gucci dressin, still that coochie pressin
My pimp game smooth be-gets 'em
I don't use discretion; cop tends to be stressin
Fuck explainin it, who's he testin?
Finsta perform all physical forms
Leave your ass shakin like a Mystikal song
Please Dumb, what type of shit was you on?
Cause man to compress a nigga mean One less a nigga (uh-huh)
All I want is my niggas all recruitin a slimmy
All I want is my liver all polluted with Remy
Duel with any, bring it, I face-off
Son you out your league like Jordan was with baseball

[Verse 5 - Chali 2na]
Yeahhh, your majesty, word flash photography
Third class economy, blade slashed your artery
Nerve gassed anatomy, blurred past dramatically
Herbs hashed, my word splash packed agility
Never predictability
Manouvers of mind fully designed cause I'm true to the rhyme
We do the sublime, crackin yo' backbone
Attackin you wack clones
Vernacular right and exact, capital rap zone
That come back verbal assault rifle (ahhhhh)
We fight like Stokely Carmichael
Nope! We just like you
We broke and ain't no tellin what we might do
Ain't no joke
Provoke the right to reverse to seek mercy
With the King Asiatic and Percee P
Ain't heard the worst of me, until your chest 3-D
Spit venom and burn your body like a STD

[Verse 6 - Marc 7]
Put a 20 on the next brother steppin to me wrong
I mess around a lick cause you done cheat on my theme song
This might seem wrong, but this is a mean song
Crushed like King-Kong, and just like ping-pong
Back and forth, I spit knowl' and toss, it's time to floss
My verbal affirmation is to always go off
When syllables slide you'll be enjoyin the vibe
When consider it pride, it's J5
When another deadly medley, camera action yo we heavy
Aim steady slash machette Maserati engine ready
Good and plenty don't be petty count the fetti and we jetti
OFF to another city where we do our nitty grity
We wild like Serengeti, tear it down let's seek and set it
Get ready, for the ride, verbally hang-glide
Write and stay tight, mission's in sight
Murderer worldwide the stage is yo' knife[Verse 1: Percee P]

Since breast-feeding, my flesh-eating flows had the best leading rappers' chests beating, fast
Best dash, leave and lit your head, when I spit it's said like you're being hit with lead
Pipes with spikes that'll rip to shreds
You and your men Jack can sit back
From the impact like I was sitting strapped when napalm buried your skin, cat
Infernal heating, so much you run, spitting like I bust a gun, make you suffer from internal bleeding
Raps that kill, drop 'em, play my tracks they're ill like a jacket your cat with a punkish thug acting real
Home gone, skull torn, showin' family mourn throwin' dirt, but the search for the killer still long gone
Attack you, nigga; sneak up from the back and get you with raps
Then slit your throat like they wrote about Jack the Ripper
My dough short, with no thoughts, I let my flows scorch
And burn your whole fort down to the ground like a blowtorch
This mad will gets fans killed in a landfill
Make you stand still, get your head and hands drilled damn real
I aim raps like I aim gats to the head
Where said to make a lame cat's brains splat, leavin' remains on the train track
I'mma stalk your boys, travel like a Tomahawk
Eat'em so bad, you'll think it's Dahmer's fort the way they find the corpse
And wild lames get migraines like the sun of hot flames, they bought frames tinted or their eye drains
Speakers blow and the beat, it flows
Start reachin' those peeps at shows, making each of my foes decompose
Thoughts of anger, those in my torture chamber, I abort with hangers
Brave men get bitch-smacked
I click-clack, spit fast shit at your six-pack make your ribs crack and cave in (yeah)
This is Percee P, every verse with me's like Murder in the First Degree, disperse and flee!

[Verse 2: Edan]
For any entertainer
I got a torture chamber
Torch the flame to scorch and abort the brain
Forcing pain to contort your veins
Make a gelatin of a skeleton to support your frame
Orchestration with adequate manifestation
Panic awaits them in an attic or basement
Ancient bracelets (spikes on the inner perimeter!)
Grab and jab a knife to give him an enema
In a minute or two
Venom is spewed through the lips of a snake that I hit with a rake to aggravate
(Activate the radioactive waste!) to drown a clown in a bath that assassinates
Fascinated with acid
I ate it and hallucinated while I bruised and mutilated your Central Nervous System
(Sending nervous victims!)
Through a mechanism that'll, (bend, tend and twist 'em!)
Shred 'em, behead 'em
Before I get 'em I let 'em get a glance at the, two-headed tarantula
Avalanche and an antler to puncture pant legs
Your life span's limited you can't beg
I jam dead corpses
In hand-fed portions
In through the jaws
If a man-bred swordfish
Altered genetically to have big teeth that kill
While the henchmen keep him still!
A secret thrill exists within the mind of a frequent killer skilled at bending rhymes
To the shape of an axe, scrape and attack;
No escaping the facts, placed in the vat
Where in the neck is a knife that's black and char-broiled
I slit brains, I got gargoyles to spit flames
Rippin' physical frames and lacing them with spider-bites
Remove your legs and make you ride a bike and blow the dynamite!I spit at you like a 9 milli do
Feel and kill a crew
When syllables connect like umbilical cords
Leave frauds in critical, Lord, it’s pitiful
Better tell 'em I’m lethal
Burn his weak crew and all his people
Flows eat through his brain
You can see and reach through his cerebellum
Hurt a fake, when I serve a plate, no one regurgitates
Every word I state rips through bones and vertebrae
Increasing the murder rate
My fans are placed in rehab
My grammar's laced with more shit than sanitation
Every man is facing contamination
Heed advice, Percee P is nice
Coming back to lead us twice like Jesus Christ
Was my flow to blow? Now all you need is ice
Got my hands traced and a big fan base
From every land race
Since this man laced tracks way back
And never seen my damn face

One of a kind
Bright like the sun when it shines
When it come to my rhymes
If you dumb in the mind, don’t sing none of my lines
Hit cities quick, like pretty chicks
Perce ain’t no idiot, hit fifty six
Get with me, shit, that’s one hundred twelve titties licked
Count 'em
Ratta tatta, like a gat I’ll shoot data at you bladder
So scatter, cause I splatter brain matter just for chatter
Hope you run, displays are like switch-blades with AIDS
I get paid, my shit played more than kids crave Pokemon
Rap deacon from that region that got acts even with gats
Leaving the game and fame behind like Cat Stevens
Inspired pros, retired foes
Perce ain’t liable, tryin’ to blow requires dough
People die at shows tryin’ to bust my rapid fire flows
Manipulate rhymes, liquidate and rip a break, bitch get a whip and grapes
I’ll lick the plate and them things those strippers shake
In fact listen, “G”, cats dissin’ P go back missin’ teeth
Acts wish to be like me - a part of black and rap history[Vinnie Paz]
It's Vinnie paz daddy! Jedi mind tricks!
My man Stoupe holdin it down
It's the real raw shit
The hardcore shit, kna-am sayin?

Yea

[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
Friday the thirteen-style slashing ya face
Bashing ya face, tell ya army, get back to their base
C'mon cousin, that's how we get down
We the only reason that you eat and breath in this town
We beatin them down
Raise a blade, buck 50
I rap like no one out there can fuck with me
Stuck with me, we ain't leaving the game
And keep it dirty cause we never had a reason to change
We keep it the same, start a war with the Glock nine
And thug like a mob, and rock mine
So let me speak the truth again
The ancient babylonians were nubian
You need to watch what you read in your class
Cause the devil try to have you all repeating the past
I'm ready to go to war for Mumia
Fuck George Bush and his war, we gawn see him

[Hook]
Yea, walk with me now
Yea, walk with me now
*Tryna step into the zone with Vinnie Paz is a...*
*understand that I ain't really fuckin around*
Yea... Yea, walk with me now
*Live raps crack ya jaw (Live raps crack ya jaw)*
Yea, walk with me now...
[Verse 2: Percee P]
I came down, to shame clowns, kickin' my same sound
I'mma reign now, giant fist-splitted james brown
I'm the poet, whose rhymes was quoted
Lines are loaded
Shine decoded the vote and flow and showing signs I wrote it
At a auction, B, style cost some g's
Challengers eyes makes tears like the Force MDs
Percee P, that's me I get nasty
Rock it flashy, pass me the mic, it's your ass, G
But I make threats, tape decks at my apex
Packing latex, and safe sex with chicks and stricken paychecks
Killing ya, fillin' ya with rhymes similar
To bullets in the cylinder of a dillinger spillin' ya braincells
I'll blast ya later, you be readin' essays
And be there next day like JFK's assassinator
Nobody, ever went to represent
It's evident why you hesitant cause I take every cent and your hottie

[Hook]
Yea, walk with me now
Yea, walk with me now
*Tryna step into the zone with Vinnie Paz is a...*
*understand that I ain't really fuckin around*

[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]
I'm like a desert eagle when the hammer is cocked back
Anybody holding any money should drop that
We shot back, spit a gospel of force
And burn ya'll, with my philosophical thoughts
We're just tryna bring the raw shit
Smoke a L, drink a forty on the block, raw shit
The hardcore shit, for ya'll to dumb out
Standing the back of the club and pull the gun out
Everybody run out, the sun out, it's over
I'll take it back to the past like Sankofa

[Outro: Vinnie Paz]
Yea, it's vinnie paz baby. Stoupe - The enemy of mankind
It's like a brotherhood, it's all blood
It's all love baby, it's all love
Walk with me now
Walk with me now, what's the deal baby?
Walk with me now
It's Jedi Mind, steadily shine
Live from the 215, keepin it live... aight? Yea, yea

*Fades*Geeeeeeeeeeeeeeet up!

[Aesop Rock]
Wake up, wake up
Ayo Percee P, it's time to wake these kids up

[Percee P]
Word up Aesop Rock, they'd better take their fingers off
Pause and hit record

[Aesop Rock]
Is you fat cats or lab rats?
Trails to my steppin got em sweatin flashbacks
I played a part of minesweeper, plunking sneakers in my sunken city
Defunct, and apparently examinin' famine, I'm a
Volatile strobe while your blind spot swallows the globe
Sink through the track and think back
When I was a boy I employed styles exhausted
By every lost child at present
Normally I drill pillars of normalcy
You're cordially invited to accompany me
In rotation of the tables to label the opposition
As I choose, refusing to evolve with the cold
Rapidly dissolved my involvement in a solvent of soul and roll back
Brain trip the Beta weights trap for the slaughter
Like livestock infected with anthrax
On my call a pack or clan snaps, collapsed was the mandatory maze
Where the bluest ribbons yeilded glory days
Desire on the opposite circuit and glorious days
Is glorious hazes of gray spun through my array of operation
Slave to idiot box revalations
And wrapped tightly in a practice with my colleagues and slackers
20,000 league nappers and the swelling increases
Once the mortar hit the pestal your whole vessel fell to pieces
And I laughed, I laughed for me and my starving art family
I laughed tangibly, your failures ampin me to vamp fresh
My mic stabs white flags in drags, trembling
Devil skin-wearers through the terrors of compliance
Once the day turns night, senoritas suck the woody like termites
And wonder how they got labeled dick-hungry damsels in distress
The all new and improved poetically portable Aesop Rock
Available in stores with my, highly suggested parental discretion
In 99 brilliant new dimentions

[Percee P]
I'm not your average man bragging, toe or hand tagging
50 grand bagging, pants sagging, trigger nigga on the bandwagon
Huh, I know this nigga named Rickey his girl Nikki want to get with me
Says "Stick me just a quickie, lick me and leave a hickie"
I stick instead of tricking bread in this chickenheads
One look and said I ain't shit in bed, she must be licking lead
You'd better let your gods recognize the Rhyme Inspector hides
And never sweat them lies about me haters check your eyes
One verse, lung burst, as I done first
Guns, slums, hearse don't stun Perce, where I'm from's worse (sucker)
My new cuts are hot, bodies chewed up a lot
Then flew up the block to a cipher, blew up the spot
Stacks of rhymes, ain't a match for mines, tracks and shine
Leave you back in time in a ?beeler? still ain't at my prime
I'm a stab your face in, trial and shit is wild
I turn the dial, niggas stealing my style
I should file for reparations

"Aesop Rock" "Percee P" *scratched til fade*{Percee P}
I rap with knowledge
Lines compiled in a complex style
Convey 'em intricately say 'em slay 'em and exile
Wild rap competitors get ready for my metaphoric
Phrase, Madlib amaze, when he displays
His track scratch and catch the record?I match the tempo
With lyrics that swing, no strings attached
My brain causes migraines, with lyrics I reign
I came to dispose of foes and competition dissin' my name
Rap fans remember me for my lyrical chemistry
Brains might explode
Knowledge overloads my memory bank
All on the radio
Got a record?album in?stores
If yours?get wit it, get it?and check it out
Clever whoever has it and don't pass it
I'll burn 'em like boric or hydrochloric acid
Or gastric juices
Percee P produced this
Now?on the mic, biters are likely to use this
Crowds I entice?I charge the largest price
To rock, pockets are packed?the fact is?I'm that nice
I'm poetical, to a science know every medical
Meaning, line 'em, define 'em in an order alphabetical
Rhymes vary and carry?proficient?vocabulary
That won't diminish, but finish?off any?adversary
In a second, I reckon my rhymes will take effect
And just paralyze your body, from the neck and up
Adversaries I dominate, titles I accommodate
Out loud, the crowd proudly nominate
Me as the best emcee, Stones Throw invest in me
After I rock, girls flock, caressin' me
In?parties a lot, Bacardi or not
I'll rock a 90 minute tape and leave nobody a spot
To bust a rhyme on it
I'll put a dime on it
You're gonna love it, and dub it, because I'm on it, uh
Don't try to riff, take a whiff of some coffee
Smack up those that act up, so back up off me
Laugh at ya like a psycho, might go after ya
Worse than the Valentine or Chainsaw Massacre
Any men within with talent
Challenging the P is not clever
They'll never walk or talk again
I build, your skills go downhill and dilapidate
Records?i made?will be played by half the state
Girls are winkin', I leave 'em thinkin'
Gotta rewind every line, before my rhyme finally sinks in
I'm not in college but knowledge I do accommodate
Since I'mma dominate, y'all know who to nominate
Rappers are runnin' around
I'm aimin' and gunnin' 'em down
With lyrics I dare them to front on me now
Got the balls? Boo me, fans send cards to me
Punch-lines?will stall?Cooney, since y'all knew me
I've been deep?like Paul Mooney
I might show up so get a hearse
Ain't no nigga worse than me when I kick a verse, mics blow up
Like a nuclear blast, you see a flash that melts ya
A fallout shelter can't help your ass
From Perce's versatility, hostility
You're wack black and lack the ability to kill a P
Women?
I like
How I treat 'em?
Like the mic
I plug it in, turn 'em on and get hype and go
On and on, I rap 'til my mic's worn, torn, done son
You're unreal, just like a unicorn
You make me sick when you contradict
If you diss me or piss me off I'mma stomp you quick, slick[Verse 1] Vinnie Paz

My guns are bigger than a baby’s arm
With Agent Orange like I was raised in ‘Nam
The bullets stay inside your brain like it’s your favorite song
I don’t give a fuck who they hitting, they can graze your mom
I load the motherfucking clip in, they like baby bombs
I see it as something beautiful when the metal fly
Around the way call me Lucifer, a hell of a guy
I’m a motherfucking veteran I’m telling you why
Beat his head until there’s red in them I’m letting 'em die
City of brotherly thugs, the home of filthy living
You ain’t fucking around with Vinnie, Percee, and Guilty Simpson
Unless you wanna be the target that we dump the clip in
I do the shit during the day, I like the gun to glisten
You a backwards motherfucker you run prison
You think that being locked with males in jail's a fun position
You should kill yourself rapper and be stuck in the earth
To be honest ain’t no rapper that can fuck with you first

[Hook]

For the cats in the hood with a rep
Hustle through the AM when most men slept
In the waistline where the roscoe’s kept
I’m on the edge nigga watch yo' step

I’m on the edge nigga watch your step
We here to eat till there’s no food left
In the waistline where the roscoe’s kept
I’m on the edge nigga watch yo' step

[Verse 2] Percee P

Fast or slow pace my flow lace tracks this cat’ll throw bass
And don’t waste steps and go chase broads to no place
Master streets, impress the freaks, pimps dressed for weeks
Hoes left to me I guess to cheat and test the sheets
Ripping shows from here to Britain yo I’m hitting hoes
Skipping those women that sniffin' blow and not getting dough
First degree murder rhymes disturbing mind like urban lies
And quote words only science to Percee P
Amateurs know they can’t stand with the pro
My Los Angeles flow cause damages most scandalous foes better handle it yo
I’m getting that food that are steady ripping blacks
Spitting raps, hitting cats for kicking wack lyrics to bitten tracks
My interviews say I said a few lines to diminish crews
Some men’ll do shit like bending rules
Go for the kill I’ll still finish you
I’m so hot we gotta close shop, you know not to open your spot
While I patrol blocks you getting no props

For the cats in the hood with a rep
Hustle through the AM when most men slept
In the waistline where the roscoe’s kept
I’m on the edge nigga watch yo' step

I’m on the edge nigga watch your step
We here to eat till there’s no food left
In the waistline where the roscoe’s kept
I’m on the edge nigga watch yo' step

[Verse 3] Guilty Simpson

Guilty Simpson damage is beyond word descriptions
Rough verse inscriptions wrote by cutthroats
Smoke in the alley where the young cats bust toast
Pinching pennies to pay up his truck note
My various techniques compare with Jet Li
I’ll chop with an AK and kick when it’s pay day
Let’s see how many men must test me
Deadly with a pen, let the rest beware
Face down in the playground six feet deep
In the sandbox when my right hand cocks back on the hammer
You rest in peace
I pray on wack cats when I bless the beats
Like priests in the Vatican heat rat-a-tattling
And sprayed up the vehicle your homeboy traveled in
Fuck the spots they brag about
We kick your front door way in and drag em out[Verse 1 - Akil]
Yo, my metaphor, my musical madness
Move and motivate those with musical talents, uhh
Read it in bold print, we holdin it down
Lick a shot, hip-hop when we in yo' town
Uhh, master blaster sound
Freak the future far from here and now
With style, release increase the peace, uhh
Bubble with the beat 'til they feelin the heat in the streets
Now each one, teach one, reach one, young gun
On one, listen to the warrior's drum
Beatin up the block with the ghetto hop that knock
And make you wanna crash the spot
And unlock explode (BOOM) the alpha and omega code
With drum rolls and old soul, we uphold
And foretold to scores of six years ago
Fast flow from G. Rap to Kool Moe
Supasyllable, major to the minimal
Every individual, bounce to the tempo yo
Lungs collapse and raps be trapped in
The only way to make it happen, jaw-jappin, fast rappin

[Verse 2 - Zaakir]
Yo, I'm the hot dog that run the hottest monologue
In star poetic inserts and yes y'all s
My speech is like holding two Glocks apiece
The outreach that rock police
The super adventure men portend to put somethin in bitches
Win when we write, the Emmy winner get hyped, off any printer
And I came to get it (HIT IT)
Like Operation PUSH, operate the tush
Black octopus of soul, in inter-planetary patrol
I planted my gold, and low and behold
It's the brother doc, ready to rock-rock
Don't stop Hobbes, I'm hot like the lumberjack chop chop
The wordsmith, I write in block letters of cursive
Curse my circus, serve this surface
And watch how the brother get over
The fly Cassanova with the frankincense odor

[Verse 3 - Percee P]
Bear witness
To where riches'll make career bitches share pictures
When the ears get this ya brain's software'll glitch
Splatter your brains
Leave scattered remains of matter and stains
That'll explain how you was battled and slain
I get rude and go, to your show and use a row
Of fans to BOO and throw you off 'til you lose your flow
A pro, mean like Joe Greene when I blow theme
Put your whole team on pause like cold cream
Then show laughter when I flow faster, your ho have ta
Go after her weave from the breeze when I blow past ya
I'm dapper plus ghetto and just pedal
When the dust settles we left in the rubble the crushed metal
Nurses with hearses sealin conversed with lit purses
Spit fire, make you first to bit, try me
Like Osama, or Dahmer', I'mma cause trauma
And homicides when I collide I get kamikaze

[Verse 4 - Big Daddy Kane]
Kane baby, walk hard, the p-jects
On streets of Brooklyn I'm a crew of D-cepts
On streets of L.A. I'm a whole E-set
On tracks with Jurassic I be the T-Rex
Still that Gucci dressin, still that coochie pressin
My pimp game smooth be-gets 'em
I don't use discretion; cop tends to be stressin
Fuck explainin it, who's he testin?
Finsta perform all physical forms
Leave your ass shakin like a Mystikal song
Please Dumb, what type of shit was you on?
Cause man to compress a nigga mean One less a nigga (uh-huh)
All I want is my niggas all recruitin a slimmy
All I want is my liver all polluted with Remy
Duel with any, bring it, I face-off
Son you out your league like Jordan was with baseball

[Verse 5 - Chali 2na]
Yeahhh, your majesty, word flash photography
Third class economy, blade slashed your artery
Nerve gassed anatomy, blurred past dramatically
Herbs hashed, my word splash packed agility
Never predictability
Manouvers of mind fully designed cause I'm true to the rhyme
We do the sublime, crackin yo' backbone
Attackin you wack clones
Vernacular right and exact, capital rap zone
That come back verbal assault rifle (ahhhhh)
We fight like Stokely Carmichael
Nope! We just like you
We broke and ain't no tellin what we might do
Ain't no joke
Provoke the right to reverse to seek mercy
With the King Asiatic and Percee P
Ain't heard the worst of me, until your chest 3-D
Spit venom and burn your body like a STD

[Verse 6 - Marc 7]
Put a 20 on the next brother steppin to me wrong
I mess around a lick cause you done cheat on my theme song
This might seem wrong, but this is a mean song
Crushed like King-Kong, and just like ping-pong
Back and forth, I spit knowl' and toss, it's time to floss
My verbal affirmation is to always go off
When syllables slide you'll be enjoyin the vibe
When consider it pride, it's J5
When another deadly medley, camera action yo we heavy
Aim steady slash machette Maserati engine ready
Good and plenty don't be petty count the fetti and we jetti
OFF to another city where we do our nitty grity
We wild like Serengeti, tear it down let's seek and set it
Get ready, for the ride, verbally hang-glide
Write and stay tight, mission's in sight
Murderer worldwide the stage is yo' knife[The Controls]
Does it feel, you're the coward of the year?

[Percee P]
I'm so laborious, bright
Its a wreck in dire vocabulary
Adversaries will commence to ignite like magnesium oxide combined with peroxide
I'm hazardous, poisonous, the carbon monoxide
Earning stacks, gold/sterling plaques from burning tracks
Your learning that if your unconcerned with rap no turning back now
Man I'll bomb you please from up in the trees
I'll freeze the season with a tighter squeeze than Aaron Cometbus

[Aesop Rock]
Ayo, one heart plated with purely golden tiles
Mixed with a little mischief, behold style
Load a back alley shaman liquid tomb raider
With a most fertile assortment of spitting logic
For the lab rat's gone colossus in the spotlight
Now Aesop Rock be the handle
While your breath control is tough, to breath along is not enough
I correspond to a kick snare blind
But share the passion
But a small percentage of the masses and their fashion

[The Controls]
You got a feeling that you got me where you want me
I've wait within the palm of your hand
And you've got cartoons in the morning while I'm sleeping
I've just got dreams that I don't understand

[Percee P]
Supply the checks, Known from Cali, Chi to Lex
My respect and styles some try to get, but die direct from the side affects
You crave Perc cause I'm well equip with predicate
Your too delicate for this fella flip kid you better get saved first
Called freaks give me no floor feet all sweet small peeks
Cause my stocks exchange they bore street still the slick
Kicking the illest hits who kill us quick when I build this?
Spit more rounds than Bruce Willis flicks
Ideas and flow raise eyelids that's why kids make hybrid rhymes
Supplied with step this God did years ago to grasp a taste
Have to place them in a glass case and observe 'em from a Nasa space center with a mask on face
Coward of the year make others fear the way this brother is empowered
I am the bomb, don't try tampering with my brand of style could by stand
The only witness ??? is God's (this guy's) camera taping me

(Singing) I'm here, Does it feel, You're the coward of the year?
I'm gone too far somebody pull me home, too gone, too far, too gone, too far

[Aesop Rock]
Sadly I withered a non-believer
When pride covered this must lust, anger, gluttony, envy and sloth
Form the frame of your demeanor
I address but a rapidly lessening portion of majors
Dissolved in the abortion of creations new laborers
Pilot burner riddle of trades, divinity, composers
And tunnel through and out of spite the anti hero dosage
In a cradle I label the dreaded simulation we compile
Tenets embedded within synthetic inclination
We have never dined on bait so when corrupt crooks
Hook simple Samaritans' eyes buried in books
Shift on a badda datta sun moon merger to guard the difference
The New York MC population dancing uncontrollable expansion
I, cyclothymic pound dodger
Push a wooden nickel towards town squatter bother me not
My wallow across the village drunk and mumbling in the streets
'bout how an angel gets its wings with every blue note I release
An angel gets its wings with every blue note I release?
Could this be lies? Cause I'm gonna spit cobalt 'til every angel fly's
I blew the operation set to clinch victor
Walkie talkers turn awkward fixtures to complete the wicked mixture
The fire and ice combination adjourns fresh
I return with the last living specimen caressed
When the earth is vacated and the populous cleared
I'll be the last star fighter sipping a goblet of my tearsI got a greater rhyme and state of mind
If you wack I won't say a line or pay a dime to hear ya
What I dare ya, to step up
Diss you fast, hit ya ass with the trash you get swept up
2 out of 3 states, know the P's great, and yell out
If I sell out it's only on my release date
Huh I came out, had these bitches screaming my name out
Now they wanna see me, believe me, that easy
Swing you bust, when I sing and cut, nigga hang it up
Bringing what pal, you ordered that style from Finger Hut
When Percee P sing a rhyme, your comp get stomped
Cause they can't swing a line so they bring a nine

Don't come strapped, I come here to rap and tell them people
(Clap your hands everybody)
Don't come strapped, I came here to rap and tell them people
(Clap your hands and what)
(Leave your 9's at home and bring your skills to the battle)

Girls just giving me sex, I eat ’em like a T-Rex
I’m playing but I have ’em saying "me next, me next"
You can't compare me yo, with these other brother's material
On your stereo but you don't hear me though
You better handle it son, don't step to me
Or try to do me, don't wanna sue me when some damage is done
My tune rocks, the speakers on your boom box
Keep my hotel room locked and let ya on that boom knock
I never take breaks and hoe’s with the great shape
I hate snakes, fakes screaming date rape to make papes
I always set it off, the best, the stress I get it off
My chest, you test and let it off

Don't come strapped, I come here to rap and tell them people
(Clap your hands everybody)
Don’t come strapped, I came here to rap and tell them people
(Clap your hands and what)
(Leave your 9's at home and bring your skills to the battle)

I'm taking everyone out, who tell me, "yo shit will never sell P"
The hell g, just wait until my LP come out
And bitches will be asking to me
The nigga who be blasting a jeep
They used to pass in the street
The cutie say more, I’ll be damned if the booty's paid for
I’m live in a fort like Rudy Vaymour
For me pall, bet you got the deal try’na be wild
Or senile, but I got mine just busting freestyle
I set a slick rhyme, people causing sending letters quick
To say I’m better with words and herps dropping rhetoric
I get retarded black, causing cardiac
Arrest in the BX where hip hop started at
But way back niggas was still strapped
Didn’t freestyle when the rap, your proving your act
On the map, and tell another people come running

Don't come strapped, I come here to rap and tell them people
(Clap your hands everybody)
Don’t come strapped, I came here to rap and tell them people
(Clap your hands and what)
(Leave your 9's at home and bring your skills to the battle)[Lord Finesse]
Yeah yeah, I got my motherfucking man in the house, you know
What I'm saying? Tell 'em your name just about now and shit

[Percee P]
Ayo I'm the Rhyme Inspector MC Percee P

[Lord Finesse]
Now, just about now, we gonna both do this, but I want you to
Do me a motherfucking favor, you know what I'm saying? (What's
That?) Let them motherfuckers know they ain't hearing what you
Doing right about now, you know what I'm saying?

[Percee P]
Like Mike Tyson I'll bash your face in for basing
Give me some space and I'll put your head out if you get out of place and
Rip you like plastic, don't make me get drastic
Better step fast, quick to get that ass kicked
What could you do to this? I ain't new to this
For you to diss me and come off is ludicrous
I ain't with that, so get back and get that
Wick wack shit out my face before you get smacked
Like a hooker short on my cash
I want all my money, you sonny, I'll put this foot up your ass
I got your bitch all on my dick
I go her panties, her bra, her car and she star in my next flick
It's a triple-X jammie
I rode her like a Camry, damn P, I know you can't stand me
I'm Percee P, P stands for pimp
She gave me head, plus she said that in bed you a dead wimp
He's a goner, working for me on the corner
Locked like a vote, know who to consult if you still wanna
I get devious, treacherous, bet you this
Next verse Perce rehearsed is worse than the previous
Lyrical format leaves your head sore, black
Base and I wipe my feat on you face like a doormat
Percee P, that's who I claim to be
But you're amatuers, you're all the same to me
Yeah, you's a duck and your girl gets fucked
Bout to live it up or giving up her ass for a fast buck
Don't get me upset, B, I'm deadly
Sweat me or press up I'll mess up your head, B
You're booty, so step off and rehearse a few
Hours, and take a shower, take it personal
Lord Finesse, my rhyme have to end
So get on the mic and let yours begin

[Lord Finesse]
Drop it, kick it, I'm about to rip it
I'm young, black, and gifted, plus I sound wicked
I stomp any opponent I come against
So be for real, they don't really want none of this
Since I'm slowing down, I got to keep it flowing now
Tonight it kindd of special, make mine a Lowenbrau
I get ahhs and ooohs not boos because I'm real cool
Fucking with Finesse is the wrong career move
I be taking crews without breaking rules
You know damn well I don't have time to be breaking rules
I'm all about cash flow, pull girls like a lasso
A brother roast me on the mic? Don't be an asshole
I'm indestructable, so bring in a substitute
What's up with a battle? (I can't fuck with you)
So don't try testing me, MC's especially
Couldn't win against me if you paid the referee
You can't get with me, so don't say shit to me
You're out your mind if you're trying to get a victory
You can't affect me with your weak technique
If this was a game, you probably couldn't check me
You might be wild, but I'm on an iller tip
Think you stand a chance? You could kill that shit
I'm intellectual, getting the best of you
I eat MC's like the food at a festival
Drop science and math, stand tall like a giraffe
Completing the task, breaking rappers in half
Puting suckers out of it, yeah I talk a lot of shit
But when it comes to rhymes I deserve a fucking scholarship
Won't front or perp the role, I get the most of hoes
I'm so cool I got girls on remote control
Whether you're a virgin or a bad-looking hot sister
I'm bagging up bitches like a shoplifter
So Lord Finesse is not the one to fool
I was getting sex since they first invented underoos
Got knowledge of self, so who needs a school for help?
Brothers can't get with Finesse, don't even fool yourself
When I begin I set the trend
And I show men, the motherfuckers got no wins
Goddamn, it's no scheme, scam, or plan
I'm just kicking flavor with my motherfucking man

(Lord Finesse and Percee P give shoutouts til fade)[Percee P]
Check it out... You hit me, hit me with a little something...
Check it out, check it out... Check it out...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, check it out...

I'm a innovator, eliminator of imitators
I intimidate 'em disintegrate 'em with demonstratin'
Poetical skills whoever gets healed better 'll field
And they better at building mind's rhymes that never get killed
If you're clever never play me close champ
When I kick it I get wicked I'm lickin' it stickin' it like a post stamp
It takes six, I can make hits accapella
I should sell a million of and livin' like Rocafella
Battle me? I gotta see m'originality of strategy
Or that'll be another fatality
Rap and I like the sport and I write with thought
On the mic record adversaries 'll put 'em on life support I
Heard your soundtrack, lyrics sound wack to me
Actually I'm the best around black
T-Ray make beats, others take beats
Abuse 'em use 'em to death but they'll never level the breakbeats
Those with audacity tryina smash the P
Won't last with me using their full capacity
If you wanna get deep, I made a big leap
From corners, now I'm on a label called Big Beat
Percee P's unforgetable
Writin' recitin' incredible shit no-one else could ever do

Check it out, I'm out...[Eh yo, Perc] eh, yo, what's up?
[Eh yo, kick some ol' lung collapsing lyrics
For the feeble minded MCs to assimilate] all right
[Yo, let the homicides begin]
I know what you mean, yo, give me the mic

I'm the capital P-E-R-C-double E dash P-P dash double E-C-R-E-P in me
Shots in top lyrical fitness that's why you bit this
Get this, I got a witness and I won't quit this
And flip flop, get dropped, shit I'm in tip top shape
Lyrics escape, can't even catch him with tape
Main attraction using my brain a fraction
Of my knowledge or wisdom a lyrical rhythm'll give 'em
A migraine, before I reign on stage
You better walk like the fingers on a yellow page
Rhymes and homicides are lethal, nobody's equal to me
No one survived, so why make a sequel?
MC Percee P give no mercy to anybody MC'in 'till they reimburse me
I cold grip the mic, strike then rip his life
My raps dilapidate adversaries with kryptonite
Hit you with a verse, make you disperse but first
Call up a hearse cause Perc leave you worse than this
Brain cells shatter, MCs scatter
I splatter them all with something that ain't even matter
Got a ladder on stage women runnin', comin' every age
But never(?) ring on my finger this thing'll linger un-engaged
Renegade, Percee P ain't afraid of no one
No gun or son, I'm gettin' paid and my rec's played
Every weekend like lottery, rap's a part of me
Words flow but don't show no blood in you artery
Ladies greet me, treat me like the stars
When I show up they start to throw up all their panties and bras at me
Rap is the last of me now to gas women with my pencil
I send you into a mental catastrophe
This rhyme ain't designed for prime time
And a battle line for logic behind every mind
Tryin' to rhyme with intellect, spellin' all incorrect
Defy your every line, mine's an introspective
Those in the premises will always remember this
Record, elected your top ten, stop then and reminisce
Percee P, no rapper get worse than me
When it comes to rhymes every verse will be
Harder than titanium, parts from your cranium
Burst, disperse, every verse explodes like uranium
So, yo, don't upset me, cause that will only get me
Mad enough, it's bad enough, I had enough of
Lettin' this amateur rock a cord or wallabies
I bet they're all the P's
And if they ain't they gonna be
To all y'all critics, just admit it
My style is dope
You can't cope and you hope to get it
You're captivated, activated, rap related fans leave infatuated
When I get open the place starts smokin'
You start chokin', showboat and Perc get broken
Rehearse a while, let it get versatile
I reverse your style, ok, be then maybe Perc'll smile
You're put in a stretcher
When I let the style get ya', I bet ya'
Sweat the Rhyme Inspector
Records you manufacture are so wack you can't
Sing 'em or bring 'em, people fling 'em back at ya
You're the fattest, baddest, of the best copycata's
When you played it, it's rated G for garbage cause that's your status
Nobodies iller
On the mic you never know when I'mma strike 'em like the Zodiac killer
This twenty two year old veteran, you ain't better than
Medicine won't help, slicks think we're peddlin'
When writers bite and hype the type parasites swipe
You're bitin', you're stage fright, don't even hold the mic right

Yeah, this is the Rhyme Inspector Percee P coming from the Boogie Down Bronx
I want to give a shout out to the Ultramagnetic, Organized Konfusion
To everybody around the way at Paterson Projects, I want to say peace
I dedicate this to my cousin, Kevin Turner, rest in peaceI spit at you like a 9 milli do
Feel and kill a crew
When syllables connect like umbilical cords
Leave frauds in critical, Lord, it’s pitiful
Better tell 'em I’m lethal
Burn his weak crew and all his people
Flows eat through his brain
You can see and reach through his cerebellum
Hurt a fake, when I serve a plate, no one regurgitates
Every word I state rips through bones and vertebrae
Increasing the murder rate
My fans are placed in rehab
My grammar's laced with more shit than sanitation
Every man is facing contamination
Heed advice, Percee P is nice
Coming back to lead us twice like Jesus Christ
Was my flow to blow? Now all you need is ice
Got my hands traced and a big fan base
From every land race
Since this man laced tracks way back
And never seen my damn face

One of a kind
Bright like the sun when it shines
When it come to my rhymes
If you dumb in the mind, don’t sing none of my lines
Hit cities quick, like pretty chicks
Perce ain’t no idiot, hit fifty six
Get with me, shit, that’s one hundred twelve titties licked
Count 'em
Ratta tatta, like a gat I’ll shoot data at you bladder
So scatter, cause I splatter brain matter just for chatter
Hope you run, displays are like switch-blades with AIDS
I get paid, my shit played more than kids crave Pokemon
Rap deacon from that region that got acts even with gats
Leaving the game and fame behind like Cat Stevens
Inspired pros, retired foes
Perce ain’t liable, tryin’ to blow requires dough
People die at shows tryin’ to bust my rapid fire flows
Manipulate rhymes, liquidate and rip a break, bitch get a whip and grapes
I’ll lick the plate and them things those strippers shake
In fact listen, “G”, cats dissin’ P go back missin’ teeth
Acts wish to be like me - a part of black and rap historyVerse 1
I hit the cherry harder, I’m very tard of every part of my rhyme’s
Fine like Sherry Carter I have you no adversaries smarter
I’m not about the Glocks, but dress dapper, lyrics will just tap ya
Knock yo’ best rapper out the box
I bruise and batter, crews that scatter, that used to chatter
To aprove to the fools who's phatter
I win a course in the friend of yours, she’s in a cross
Leave ’em bloody like pads in your drawers for menopause
I’m dusting niggers, urgently need emergency surgery
Every word will leave third degree burns from combustion
When the P show, never get on before or after he flow
Amigo you know my estilo from recking Stretch & Bobbito
Your shit is wack and fertile, if your friend laugh
You need to skin grab, then chew him in half, just like a snapping turtle
Put your crew to rest, lyrics go through your vest, that you the best
So for you to test, you must be on Buddha cess

Chorus
I’m nowhere near simple (What?)
My mental (Cut) into (What?)
Niggas like a Ginsu

Verse 2
From the sound of it, I’m coming from the Boogie Down of shit
Where niggas are bound to flip, when you **** counterfeit
Hustling packing steel, acting ill, attack and kill
A person to snatch their bills, if they ain’t got the rapping skills
I knock hotties, rock block parties, where people carry Glock shotties
To drop bodies, when niggas got rowdy
Better renew your verse, your crew is the worst
Claiming what they can do to Perce and who’s the first, what
Flow is in thoughts perfect, I drop the hype, after I rock tonight
Watch the mic short circuit
Your whole life ya never heard a nigga more trifle
A flow nicer than me in no cipher
I’m like a wide screen, showing drama word to mama
When I rhyme I cause more trauma then a homicide scene
Forget cable, some kid ate who, me?
My shit fatal since the time I used to rhyme on hit tables

Chorus
I’m nowhere near simple (What?)
My mental (Cut) into (What?)
Niggas like a Ginsu

Verse 3
I got my rhyme through the creeping on niggas sleeping
And with a deacon to bless the souls of rappers I hit this weekend at the ****
Let’s have a word, request the nurse
Niggas can’t mess with Perce or possess the worst shit ever heard
Résumé, say I’m one of the best today
Want to display I suggest you play “Yes you may”
The phat nigga, flowing on the tracks, slicker
That rip the shit that make you rewind back quicker quote a rap to ya
Percee P wanted for first degree
Murder since you heard a verse from me, check it
Much props getting dough like corrupt cops and drug spots
Lyrics, let of buck shots in your mug hops
Keeps it real, techniques are ill, deep and skilled
Rappers reach for steel or wheels when they peep the grill

Chorus
I’m nowhere near simple (What?)
My mental (Cut) into (What?)
Niggas like a GinsuPray to the east, pray to the east...

Yeah
I got my man in the studio
One of the illest MC's in the world
Rhyme Inspector Percee P
Kick some flavor for 94, baby

Pray to the east, pray to the east
Before you fuck around, nigga, pray to the east ( 2x )

[ Percee P ]
Your skills lack while I'm still strapped
With real raps, and feel that I should kill wack
Niggas that peel caps and that ill crap
Bigger threat than you with your tec when I rip the set
Niggas get smoked like a cigarette, so hit the deck
Watch ya chin, nigga, Ho-chi-min when I rock my shit
When it comes to props I get lots of it
I can get Madonna, money, your threats are minor
And bet you find your girl with a wet pijama
Drippin with my cassette behind her
Got more band trail than your hand's sellin
Fans scalin, jam railin like it's Van Halen
Skills scored high on billboards, I kill frauds
Get real applausesteal broads' hearts at will force
Hate a mark, skills lay a squad, and pray to god
Don't say a hard verse worse than a plate of lard
Percee P wanted for first degree
Murder, since you heard it first from me, you worshipped me
Fuckin threat, you heard nothin yet
No need for buckin tecs, but rappers to duck in fret or upper-jet
Mastered art, yo, when I flow something drastic starts
Speed up a bastard's heart, great like jurassic park
I cut you up like a sharp machete blade
Swear to god, only card you can pull if it's Medicaid
Done with all this gun shit, fuck who you run with, son split
The only thing you shoot is your dick, and it comes quick

[ Maestro Fresh Wes ]
I'm like a bat outta hell tonight, niggas compell to bite
I swell the mic when I like, fatter than cellulite
I injure ears of engineers, sendin em into cheers
Bringin my peers into tears, don't interfere
Critics know I pack a wicked blow
I put you in a clinic, so forget it like Riddick Bowe
Nigga, go to hell, I flow so well
Find another brother or mother or ho to tell
Or a bro to jeal', how's my jam gonna sell? Very well
I send you back because you bring the wack
I'm into rap, I interact with empty tracks
Locked in, wack muthafuckas are blockin
The Top 10 while the black radio jocks spin
The calmer vibe, the modified
I like the harder side, Jeffrey Dahmer tried, but died
More words than a hour of scrabble, I got the power to battle
Skadaddle or get devoured like the Tower of Babel
Adversaries are snotty, some compare me to Gotti
I bury a body, then carry a shotie
The maestro rips the psycho shit
Brain like a microchip, and I'mma excite you with
The smoother rhythm, sendin mad crews to prison
Who choose to listen while I use my U-4 missiles
Collectin the pesos from a stage show
Gettin fellatio from a h-o (why) because I say so
My ratio expands as I wreck lands
Makin def jams like Redman and X Clan
I'mma nail the genitalia from Australia to Somalia
Cause I'm smooth, just like a sailor
I damage em all, bitches give me casual calls
I'm slammin and jammin and rammin they vaginal walls
Drums are fat over funky tracks
Like Perce every verse could make your lung collapse
I'm extra-nice, who's next to slice?
Before you step to mics, nigga, check with christ
You better

Pray to the east, pray to the east
Before you fuck around nigga pray to the east...[Hook: Quasimoto]
Big Perce, keepin it hot
Raw heat, cause a nigga gotta eat
It ain't funny when a nigga gotta get money
A nigga still doin this cause we hungry
Step into the spot, ladies drop it like it's hot
Reppin the block, make the brothers pop their knots
It ain't funny when a nigga gotta get money
A nigga still doin this cause we hungry

[Percee P]
Copycats is done when tracks are done and my style of rap is sung
At the maximum, it collapse your lungs
I'm dead up, nigga batter up, you outta luck
I scatter ducks with shit that'll fuck yo' head up
Figure you fuckin with-a, bigger nigga, that'll rip-ya
That nigga switch your tone now sit your butt down and get the picture
I'm capable to scrape your crew
Put it on pay per view to make a few mill' an estate or two
You hurt up, or get smashed, quick fast if your shit's trash
You better skip past because I kick ass, word up
Splash it, burnin bastards like sulphuric acid
My jurassic classic styles are just mastered to crash ya
Don't push a Beemer, a Montero through my borough too thorough
Come through the ghetto get blasted like Hiroshima~!
The underrated one that made it, guns are traded
For my style cause they leave lungs deflated
Percee P rap is worship me they idol
Takin titles with vital rappers sided since nursery jeweler
Zoological ya, can accumulate what's in my medulla
Your molecular structure ruptured with tumors

[Hook]

[Percee P]
What I state's a blessing, can't make a session, tape the lesson
Scrape the best and give 'em hard times like the Great Depression
Adversaries bring your crew I do vary stingers
Leave every finger broke like guests on Jerry Springer when I write
Hit you like, Ripple, hard like your wife nipple, sharp as icicles
Fisher Price fit you when those on the mic switch you
Believe me you see me up like I'm a graffiti
Artist hot as Tahiti, rapper tail the streets of Cabrini (are dimes near?)
I step up like you climb stairs if the sign's clear, all lines here
Get across East to West like shuttles at Times Square
Turf BX, strong kids leave they borns with birth defects
Uhh, mics fell from my delivery of soliloquoys
I'm deadly as killer bees but more iller G, got you feelin me like braille
The ebony, one that's ever thee branded never need melodies
Cleverly I drop bombs heavenly like I'm Lebanese
Cop and tap, overseas shockin Japs, I'm toppin that
Whack shit you poppin blunt droppin wraps the heads as tight as stocking caps
I hit thighs and rip guys, clones bit my, styles to get by
Gimmicks limited thoughts and resort to get hotter than lah
See what? You versus me? Go first G
Disperse B, you like Hershey's mixed with Percee P nuts

"AWW YEAH~! Aight..."Unh.. ehh. unh

"AWW YEAH~! Aight..."[Verse: Lord Finesse]
I used to coach the team, see I'm better on the mic
Find an ace up my sleeve, never on the dice
Pushin' a 2002 if you shout and you stare
Sittin' on 110 if you countin' the spare
See ya out ya mind tryna face the God
Your rhyme is like a empty prison - a waste of bars
No time flash, see I scrape the squad
We don't ask for shit, we just take what's ours
Got the skills of titanium, straight to the cranium
Try to play me and, we can go to war like Iranians
The deep cat, I speak rap as long as the beat phat
My shit'll be off the meat rack
Lord Finesse, don't harass the God
Spit four bars and﻿ piss on like half ya squad
Sorta savage, I don't gay bash I slaughter faggots
You niggas playing Russian Roulette with automatics
See, on the street yo I'm top the rank
Three words when I get the dice: "stop the bank"
Bet against me? Yeah, you get your cash tooken
Even my street team promote nothin' but ass whoopins
How can you win in this world so cruel?
When ya learn the game niggas change the rules
Ya gotta keep cool, get down, and make moves
Show and prove in this land where cash rules
If money makes the world go round then so be it
I been﻿ broke before ain't tryna repeat it
If your plan ain't talkin' bout grands I don't need it
Ya vision ain't picturing cream? I can't see it

[Verse: Percee P]
I rap battle like Campion
Cause I'll flip on them bastards like a gymnastic champion
I entertain well
Amateurs lose stamina tryna examine the lyrics'll damage your brain cells
Yeah I pulled it
The gats trigger on fake black wiggas and wack niggas making bullshit
Y'all niggas gotta quit popping a lot of shit
I'm not a bit impressed with your raps so snap out of it
Foes with audacity, tryna smash the P
Won't last with me using their full capacity
Rhymes I'll give ya, flow like a river
With a high tide, I glide,﻿ swifter and different from others
Take a note or two
Before your shit flops and you get dropped under the Hip Hop quotables
Catch the pro at this and Kodak this
Cause your wackness can't flow like this, so go practice
Y'all ain't lyrically with it, physically fitted
To take a hit I'll break your shit and make you quit if you try to get it
My rap recital on tracks are vital
That's why no one attacks and tries to smash my title
If you're clever never play me close champ
When I kick it I get wicked I'm licking and sticking it like a post stamp
It takes six, I can make hits accapella
I could sell a million never living like Rockefeller
Got deals in the rap field
The reason I got bills cause I got ill using rap skills
And yes y'all, as I bless y'all
It's me Percee P and Lord Finesse y'all, fresh y'all(A Jaylib exclusive... with MC Percee P)

[Percee P]
I come on spittin, the song's hittin
Before there were capon chickens different dons listened to me for advice
Like I'm John, niggas just left again, so I'm steppin in
To catch wreck and when on my next kin'll be checks to spend that I'm exitin
Perc' is nice, worth the price, every verse entice
One of the most praised ministers to speak twice on the Earth since Christ
Ideas delay of light years away from what's here
I dare all my peers to slay

Two grand, review and, your whole crew man
The true fans, know who can, bring heat like in the Sudan black
No games, style is fo{?}, verbal cocaine, like propane
I blow brains bashin them no-name cats that flow lame
Writes well, recite then there's a chance you might hear
In the right air your worser nightmare after a sliced ear
Perc' spit every verse with the worst shit known
Disperse quit first clique tryin to front get they turf hit blown

(Another Bronx to Detroit to L.A. connection for that ass)[Sampled]

Keep coming back

[Woman speaking]

Here it comes again
Those powerful winds of my mind
Blowing me toward you
You keep appearing time, after time, after time

[Percee's wife speaking]

Perce we been together a long time
Through the ups, and downs
Baby I was with you since you was on the come up
But now you're considered a legend
You didn't do it by yourself, so tell 'em

[Verse 1 - Percee P]

Back in the days when Perce met her
I was the first ever, kid, did I rehearse? Never
Cats were laughing like, hyenas, I seen ya when I grabbed the mic
And said: "Yes, yes y'all", to impress y'all
Was hard, my God, it was a mess y'all
She said: "Every time you flow
They dissing", I know, "what's missing?
So grow, listen!" what
"you wanna shine put me, in your rhymes
Spend lots of quality time with me"
You'll be fine, master my, tricks or trade
I'll get you paid, when you perform
Watching people swarm like it's a raise
Spend night and day in the shack
With her, to get her to lay on a track
When I'm done I hit the streets, I'm playing her jack
I let her show her ass, while I hold the cash
Like a pimp, collecting from the people strolling past

[Hook - Fredda Payne sample]

[Verse 2 - Percee P]

When I grab my steel mic, and do her, she's real tight
Feels like I get a rush and ready to bust in her grill white
Like twats when she's quite hot, I go down town
Hit corners and pump her in the right spots
More smaller acts yell ho, and call her fat
Behind my back they be feeling her and all of that
[?]
Since day one, I stay sprung, she kept me away from
Cats in my hood that like to spray guns, they don't play son
Folks be trying to insult me, hope P, cut her off for another
But this brother don't commit adultery
I play her cheap, but she's hard to keep, from other's reach
Once in her creep, in the street, I peeped her passing in some nigga's jeep
Some times I get bitter, like when I heard this kid did her
And got a deal but I'mma still stick with her

[Hook - sample]

[Verse 3 - Percee P]

Soon as I grip it then, stick it in
She got me busting quicker than a virgin hitting skins like I'm committing sin
I'm blessed to say she takes my breath away
Like when I did her on the song [?]
When they dissed you, still I stayed with you
Devoted, got me quoted, in The Source, 92's May issue
The way I speak and freak you to a beat
I'm getting deeper, others don't reach
To leak, they bust blanks between the sheets
This song I ain't write for emcees
It's "Dedicated to the one I love", like the Temprees
Just in case, any producer's in the place
Want a taste, to catch her ear
I need a snare, and kick the right bass to her
Since this man had a G, ain't another man as bad as me
Taught me a skill, and made a real man out of me
Until those cuties throw their drawers to me
I'm staying faithful to my style, smile, yours truly, Percee P!

[Hook - Sample]{Percee P}
I rap with knowledge
Lines compiled in a complex style
Convey 'em intricately say 'em slay 'em and exile
Wild rap competitors get ready for my metaphoric
Phrase, Madlib amaze, when he displays
His track scratch and catch the record?I match the tempo
With lyrics that swing, no strings attached
My brain causes migraines, with lyrics I reign
I came to dispose of foes and competition dissin' my name
Rap fans remember me for my lyrical chemistry
Brains might explode
Knowledge overloads my memory bank
All on the radio
Got a record?album in?stores
If yours?get wit it, get it?and check it out
Clever whoever has it and don't pass it
I'll burn 'em like boric or hydrochloric acid
Or gastric juices
Percee P produced this
Now?on the mic, biters are likely to use this
Crowds I entice?I charge the largest price
To rock, pockets are packed?the fact is?I'm that nice
I'm poetical, to a science know every medical
Meaning, line 'em, define 'em in an order alphabetical
Rhymes vary and carry?proficient?vocabulary
That won't diminish, but finish?off any?adversary
In a second, I reckon my rhymes will take effect
And just paralyze your body, from the neck and up
Adversaries I dominate, titles I accommodate
Out loud, the crowd proudly nominate
Me as the best emcee, Stones Throw invest in me
After I rock, girls flock, caressin' me
In?parties a lot, Bacardi or not
I'll rock a 90 minute tape and leave nobody a spot
To bust a rhyme on it
I'll put a dime on it
You're gonna love it, and dub it, because I'm on it, uh
Don't try to riff, take a whiff of some coffee
Smack up those that act up, so back up off me
Laugh at ya like a psycho, might go after ya
Worse than the Valentine or Chainsaw Massacre
Any men within with talent
Challenging the P is not clever
They'll never walk or talk again
I build, your skills go downhill and dilapidate
Records?i made?will be played by half the state
Girls are winkin', I leave 'em thinkin'
Gotta rewind every line, before my rhyme finally sinks in
I'm not in college but knowledge I do accommodate
Since I'mma dominate, y'all know who to nominate
Rappers are runnin' around
I'm aimin' and gunnin' 'em down
With lyrics I dare them to front on me now
Got the balls? Boo me, fans send cards to me
Punch-lines?will stall?Cooney, since y'all knew me
I've been deep?like Paul Mooney
I might show up so get a hearse
Ain't no nigga worse than me when I kick a verse, mics blow up
Like a nuclear blast, you see a flash that melts ya
A fallout shelter can't help your ass
From Perce's versatility, hostility
You're wack black and lack the ability to kill a P
Women?
I like
How I treat 'em?
Like the mic
I plug it in, turn 'em on and get hype and go
On and on, I rap 'til my mic's worn, torn, done son
You're unreal, just like a unicorn
You make me sick when you contradict
If you diss me or piss me off I'mma stomp you quick, slick[Verse 1: Percee P]

Since breast-feeding, my flesh-eating flows had the best leading rappers' chests beating, fast
Best dash, leave and lit your head, when I spit it's said like you're being hit with lead
Pipes with spikes that'll rip to shreds
You and your men Jack can sit back
From the impact like I was sitting strapped when napalm buried your skin, cat
Infernal heating, so much you run, spitting like I bust a gun, make you suffer from internal bleeding
Raps that kill, drop 'em, play my tracks they're ill like a jacket your cat with a punkish thug acting real
Home gone, skull torn, showin' family mourn throwin' dirt, but the search for the killer still long gone
Attack you, nigga; sneak up from the back and get you with raps
Then slit your throat like they wrote about Jack the Ripper
My dough short, with no thoughts, I let my flows scorch
And burn your whole fort down to the ground like a blowtorch
This mad will gets fans killed in a landfill
Make you stand still, get your head and hands drilled damn real
I aim raps like I aim gats to the head
Where said to make a lame cat's brains splat, leavin' remains on the train track
I'mma stalk your boys, travel like a Tomahawk
Eat'em so bad, you'll think it's Dahmer's fort the way they find the corpse
And wild lames get migraines like the sun of hot flames, they bought frames tinted or their eye drains
Speakers blow and the beat, it flows
Start reachin' those peeps at shows, making each of my foes decompose
Thoughts of anger, those in my torture chamber, I abort with hangers
Brave men get bitch-smacked
I click-clack, spit fast shit at your six-pack make your ribs crack and cave in (yeah)
This is Percee P, every verse with me's like Murder in the First Degree, disperse and flee!

[Verse 2: Edan]
For any entertainer
I got a torture chamber
Torch the flame to scorch and abort the brain
Forcing pain to contort your veins
Make a gelatin of a skeleton to support your frame
Orchestration with adequate manifestation
Panic awaits them in an attic or basement
Ancient bracelets (spikes on the inner perimeter!)
Grab and jab a knife to give him an enema
In a minute or two
Venom is spewed through the lips of a snake that I hit with a rake to aggravate
(Activate the radioactive waste!) to drown a clown in a bath that assassinates
Fascinated with acid
I ate it and hallucinated while I bruised and mutilated your Central Nervous System
(Sending nervous victims!)
Through a mechanism that'll, (bend, tend and twist 'em!)
Shred 'em, behead 'em
Before I get 'em I let 'em get a glance at the, two-headed tarantula
Avalanche and an antler to puncture pant legs
Your life span's limited you can't beg
I jam dead corpses
In hand-fed portions
In through the jaws
If a man-bred swordfish
Altered genetically to have big teeth that kill
While the henchmen keep him still!
A secret thrill exists within the mind of a frequent killer skilled at bending rhymes
To the shape of an axe, scrape and attack;
No escaping the facts, placed in the vat
Where in the neck is a knife that's black and char-broiled
I slit brains, I got gargoyles to spit flames
Rippin' physical frames and lacing them with spider-bites
Remove your legs and make you ride a bike and blow the dynamite!Geeeeeeeeeeeeeeet up!

[Aesop Rock]
Wake up, wake up
Ayo Percee P, it's time to wake these kids up

[Percee P]
Word up Aesop Rock, they'd better take their fingers off
Pause and hit record

[Aesop Rock]
Is you fat cats or lab rats?
Trails to my steppin got em sweatin flashbacks
I played a part of minesweeper, plunking sneakers in my sunken city
Defunct, and apparently examinin' famine, I'm a
Volatile strobe while your blind spot swallows the globe
Sink through the track and think back
When I was a boy I employed styles exhausted
By every lost child at present
Normally I drill pillars of normalcy
You're cordially invited to accompany me
In rotation of the tables to label the opposition
As I choose, refusing to evolve with the cold
Rapidly dissolved my involvement in a solvent of soul and roll back
Brain trip the Beta weights trap for the slaughter
Like livestock infected with anthrax
On my call a pack or clan snaps, collapsed was the mandatory maze
Where the bluest ribbons yeilded glory days
Desire on the opposite circuit and glorious days
Is glorious hazes of gray spun through my array of operation
Slave to idiot box revalations
And wrapped tightly in a practice with my colleagues and slackers
20,000 league nappers and the swelling increases
Once the mortar hit the pestal your whole vessel fell to pieces
And I laughed, I laughed for me and my starving art family
I laughed tangibly, your failures ampin me to vamp fresh
My mic stabs white flags in drags, trembling
Devil skin-wearers through the terrors of compliance
Once the day turns night, senoritas suck the woody like termites
And wonder how they got labeled dick-hungry damsels in distress
The all new and improved poetically portable Aesop Rock
Available in stores with my, highly suggested parental discretion
In 99 brilliant new dimentions

[Percee P]
I'm not your average man bragging, toe or hand tagging
50 grand bagging, pants sagging, trigger nigga on the bandwagon
Huh, I know this nigga named Rickey his girl Nikki want to get with me
Says "Stick me just a quickie, lick me and leave a hickie"
I stick instead of tricking bread in this chickenheads
One look and said I ain't shit in bed, she must be licking lead
You'd better let your gods recognize the Rhyme Inspector hides
And never sweat them lies about me haters check your eyes
One verse, lung burst, as I done first
Guns, slums, hearse don't stun Perce, where I'm from's worse (sucker)
My new cuts are hot, bodies chewed up a lot
Then flew up the block to a cipher, blew up the spot
Stacks of rhymes, ain't a match for mines, tracks and shine
Leave you back in time in a ?beeler? still ain't at my prime
I'm a stab your face in, trial and shit is wild
I turn the dial, niggas stealing my style
I should file for reparations

"Aesop Rock" "Percee P" *scratched til fade*[Vinnie Paz]
It's Vinnie paz daddy! Jedi mind tricks!
My man Stoupe holdin it down
It's the real raw shit
The hardcore shit, kna-am sayin?

Yea

[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
Friday the thirteen-style slashing ya face
Bashing ya face, tell ya army, get back to their base
C'mon cousin, that's how we get down
We the only reason that you eat and breath in this town
We beatin them down
Raise a blade, buck 50
I rap like no one out there can fuck with me
Stuck with me, we ain't leaving the game
And keep it dirty cause we never had a reason to change
We keep it the same, start a war with the Glock nine
And thug like a mob, and rock mine
So let me speak the truth again
The ancient babylonians were nubian
You need to watch what you read in your class
Cause the devil try to have you all repeating the past
I'm ready to go to war for Mumia
Fuck George Bush and his war, we gawn see him

[Hook]
Yea, walk with me now
Yea, walk with me now
*Tryna step into the zone with Vinnie Paz is a...*
*understand that I ain't really fuckin around*
Yea... Yea, walk with me now
*Live raps crack ya jaw (Live raps crack ya jaw)*
Yea, walk with me now...
[Verse 2: Percee P]
I came down, to shame clowns, kickin' my same sound
I'mma reign now, giant fist-splitted james brown
I'm the poet, whose rhymes was quoted
Lines are loaded
Shine decoded the vote and flow and showing signs I wrote it
At a auction, B, style cost some g's
Challengers eyes makes tears like the Force MDs
Percee P, that's me I get nasty
Rock it flashy, pass me the mic, it's your ass, G
But I make threats, tape decks at my apex
Packing latex, and safe sex with chicks and stricken paychecks
Killing ya, fillin' ya with rhymes similar
To bullets in the cylinder of a dillinger spillin' ya braincells
I'll blast ya later, you be readin' essays
And be there next day like JFK's assassinator
Nobody, ever went to represent
It's evident why you hesitant cause I take every cent and your hottie

[Hook]
Yea, walk with me now
Yea, walk with me now
*Tryna step into the zone with Vinnie Paz is a...*
*understand that I ain't really fuckin around*

[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]
I'm like a desert eagle when the hammer is cocked back
Anybody holding any money should drop that
We shot back, spit a gospel of force
And burn ya'll, with my philosophical thoughts
We're just tryna bring the raw shit
Smoke a L, drink a forty on the block, raw shit
The hardcore shit, for ya'll to dumb out
Standing the back of the club and pull the gun out
Everybody run out, the sun out, it's over
I'll take it back to the past like Sankofa

[Outro: Vinnie Paz]
Yea, it's vinnie paz baby. Stoupe - The enemy of mankind
It's like a brotherhood, it's all blood
It's all love baby, it's all love
Walk with me now
Walk with me now, what's the deal baby?
Walk with me now
It's Jedi Mind, steadily shine
Live from the 215, keepin it live... aight? Yea, yea

*Fades*[Verse 1] Vinnie Paz

My guns are bigger than a baby’s arm
With Agent Orange like I was raised in ‘Nam
The bullets stay inside your brain like it’s your favorite song
I don’t give a fuck who they hitting, they can graze your mom
I load the motherfucking clip in, they like baby bombs
I see it as something beautiful when the metal fly
Around the way call me Lucifer, a hell of a guy
I’m a motherfucking veteran I’m telling you why
Beat his head until there’s red in them I’m letting 'em die
City of brotherly thugs, the home of filthy living
You ain’t fucking around with Vinnie, Percee, and Guilty Simpson
Unless you wanna be the target that we dump the clip in
I do the shit during the day, I like the gun to glisten
You a backwards motherfucker you run prison
You think that being locked with males in jail's a fun position
You should kill yourself rapper and be stuck in the earth
To be honest ain’t no rapper that can fuck with you first

[Hook]

For the cats in the hood with a rep
Hustle through the AM when most men slept
In the waistline where the roscoe’s kept
I’m on the edge nigga watch yo' step

I’m on the edge nigga watch your step
We here to eat till there’s no food left
In the waistline where the roscoe’s kept
I’m on the edge nigga watch yo' step

[Verse 2] Percee P

Fast or slow pace my flow lace tracks this cat’ll throw bass
And don’t waste steps and go chase broads to no place
Master streets, impress the freaks, pimps dressed for weeks
Hoes left to me I guess to cheat and test the sheets
Ripping shows from here to Britain yo I’m hitting hoes
Skipping those women that sniffin' blow and not getting dough
First degree murder rhymes disturbing mind like urban lies
And quote words only science to Percee P
Amateurs know they can’t stand with the pro
My Los Angeles flow cause damages most scandalous foes better handle it yo
I’m getting that food that are steady ripping blacks
Spitting raps, hitting cats for kicking wack lyrics to bitten tracks
My interviews say I said a few lines to diminish crews
Some men’ll do shit like bending rules
Go for the kill I’ll still finish you
I’m so hot we gotta close shop, you know not to open your spot
While I patrol blocks you getting no props

For the cats in the hood with a rep
Hustle through the AM when most men slept
In the waistline where the roscoe’s kept
I’m on the edge nigga watch yo' step

I’m on the edge nigga watch your step
We here to eat till there’s no food left
In the waistline where the roscoe’s kept
I’m on the edge nigga watch yo' step

[Verse 3] Guilty Simpson

Guilty Simpson damage is beyond word descriptions
Rough verse inscriptions wrote by cutthroats
Smoke in the alley where the young cats bust toast
Pinching pennies to pay up his truck note
My various techniques compare with Jet Li
I’ll chop with an AK and kick when it’s pay day
Let’s see how many men must test me
Deadly with a pen, let the rest beware
Face down in the playground six feet deep
In the sandbox when my right hand cocks back on the hammer
You rest in peace
I pray on wack cats when I bless the beats
Like priests in the Vatican heat rat-a-tattling
And sprayed up the vehicle your homeboy traveled in
Fuck the spots they brag about
We kick your front door way in and drag em out[Lord Finesse]
Aw yeah, coming is my man Andre the Giant in the house,
You know what I'm saying? I got my man Rhyme Inspector Percee P
In the house. We gonna set this off for the 90's
You know what I'm saying?

[Percee P]
We repping P-ville and Forrest in the house

[Lord Finesse]
Let Percee get his props, let him get his props

[Percee P]
Like sulfuric acid I'm lethal, soon as my words reach you
They eat through brains of those that chose to speak to
A wiser and smoother, keep up or I lose you
When I manuver words when I'm heard I confuse you, bruise you
I'm high potent, devoting much time into one rhyme
Every line of mine is worth quoting
I'm like a college dorm, people will swarm
For knowledge, applicants chill out and fill out a form
I know I'm the best MC, no one can mess with me
I'm a recepie, diss the P and you're history
Percee P's the man to praise
For day's after a phrase is said I'll leave your head phased
No one can surpass the P, get on before or after me
That can be a catastrophe
Brains I kill, when I build
With my skill, in my field cause I'm ideal
Foes I decompose from nose to toes
I will dispose of all of those that chose to go to my shows
You gotta hand it to me, you know I'm uno a sumo
Doing Judo, couldn't do no damage to me
I stayed up later made up a rhyme straight up after I ate up yours
Sprayed up yours, cause get laid up
Thinking I'm a make it big, you rap fans know it
Prepare for stale rap, and you snap your Kodak
Diss me, the P? That'll be suicide
You no frills with no skills, I'll just put you aside
Rappers are skinned in battles and winning them from within them
Befriend them, before I beat them I greet them then eat them, then send them
Now go and hide, my lyrics coincide
And dwell all through your brain cells as soon as they go inside
The Giant, you got something to say?

[A.G.]
Can I kick it? (Yes, you may)

Pass the mic, and watch how I rock the show
Suckers try to diss, now they got to go
I got so much talent
I get hype when I write and I might even get violent
I see and dismantle
You might be nice with the mic, but are you nice with your hands, too?
And I hope you're not lacking
Cause you'll be missing in action if you ain't been practicing
If you seem to get a victory and it's legit, shit
Then I'll admit you can get with me
I never quit, cause it's never none of that
Get the best rhyme and Tec-9 and I'm coming back
What, you think I'm joking?
The last nigga I broke quit rapping and started smoking
This was seen from a close fan
One crawl, some fall, none stall, not all but most ran
You should have seen them running
The tune I was humming is "A.G. is Coming"
Get your best MC's that have heart to fight
Finesse, A.G., and Percee P is gonna spark the mic
All girls leave convinced
I'm not a giant in hight, on the strength, I'm a giant in length
Cuties with booties I know how to pick 'em
(But do you stick 'em?) Ask your girl, she became another victim
Now you're heated because I'm dissing
Go ahead and get your ammunition cause I'm already on a mission
But don't approach with that wack plan
I'm one strong black man, mentally I'm a fat man
I get heated til I boil
Competition I heard to spoil, leave them under dirt and soil
A mastermind when it comes to a punchline
Anybody wants mine? That's when it's lunch time
So Finesse you got something to say?

[Lord Finesse]
Can I kick it? (Yes, you may)

I reign terror, fall off never
(So how you gonna do this?) Ayo, whatever
I prepared, equipped, and I'm here to flip
Me take a loss? I'm not trying to hear that shit
Neither me or the brothers that I run with
So grab a seat and shut up with that dumb shit
It's showtime, so it's time to get hype now
Wack MC's leave the stage, put the mic down
Just like that now, riff you get smacked now
You know what I know? You take your ass to the background
MC's I eat up, chew up, mash up
Get out of hand and I'll fuck your damn ass up
Come prepared, don't front and get scared
I grab the mic, go "One two" and say "Yeah"
I rock any track that's thrown me
A classic, a breakbeat, or even R&B
Whether a variety, or even one group
Any MC against me, now that's a dumb move
As I proceed to flip, I'm a succeed with this
A brother beat me? No one would believe that shit
So don't play me, stress me, or stand hard
Never send a pussy out to do a man's job
This is my game, I play the cards here
I bust a rapper's ass plus I send him home with car fare
I flow like a faucet, kick the crazy raw shit
I beat a rapper from the party to his doorstep
Straight up and down you don't want no conflict
Smoother than a pimp, rougher than a convict
Save the riff cause you ain't saying shit
Go against this, you get smoked like a spliff
I drop hits and watch my competitors flip
To them it's dope, to me it's just regular shit
That I dropped on the scene cause I knew it would boom
I get in a rapper's ass like a tight pair of Fruit of the Looms
They try to hang, but all of them struck out
What they need to do is retire and chill the fuck out
Cause I get fancy, funky, plus nasty
I'll be damned to let a motherfucker pass me
With my style of hip-hop, won't fall or flip flop
Here to get props cause my shit's hot
So when you see me don't hog me or crowd me
Lord Finesse saying peace, I'm Audi

[A.G.]
