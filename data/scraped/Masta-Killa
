[Intro: Ghostface Killah {Cappadonna} (Masta Killa)]
It's on {Where your sparkle at kid?}
(RZArector)

[Hook: Raekwon (Cappadonna)]
Yes the shit is raw coming at your door
Start to scream out loud, "Wu-Tang's back for more"
Yes the hour's four, I told you before
Prepare for mic fights (and plus the cold war)

[Verse 1: U-God]
This rhyme you digest through the RZA console
X Y  slam Nine Diagram pole
Raekwon dropped the bomb, Hunchback Notre Dame
Golden Arms is bronze Buddha palm hit Qu'ran
It blows extreme, mainstream be the theme, supreme team
America's Cream Team, redeemed
Vidal Sassoon, chrome tones hear the moans of Al Capone
Gun POW to the dome and split the bone
Wig blown off the ledge by the alledged
Full-fledged, sledge RZA edge
One dose of my feroc' handheld trigger cuts
Acapella spitting shell paralyse if you get touched
And critical mic cords, hanging like umbilical
Cords, dope swords, five star general
Raw be the quote rap style sore throat
Through the fully operational, handheld totem

[Hook: (first two lines)]

[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
A hundred thousand times one, snatch up my styles get done
I hold a title, and here's how my belt was won, check it
Slick majestic, broke mics are left infected
Germs start to spread through your crew through lack of effort
You asked for it, shot up the jams like syringes
My technique alone blows doors straight off the hinges
Masked Avenger, I appear to blow your ear like wind
With a freestyle, sharper than the Indian spear
So sit back and let the king explore
Describe me, the kid's nice and he holds swords
And his name, black attack's the nerve like migraines
With more gains than beggars on trains, livid sharp pains
Poisonous Rebel like Deck, you can't destroy this
You get ambushed, skate, try to avoid this
Side effects of hot raps and hot tracks
A duffel bag full of guns son, dipped in black
My culture, glides and attacks you like a vulture
Ghostface in Madison Square is on your poster

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Masta Killa]
Be on the lookout for this mass murderous suspect
That fills more body bags than apartments in projects
And as far as the coroners know
The autopsy show it was a Shaolin blow
Put on by my family brought to the academy
Of the Wu and learnt how to
Fuck up your anatomy steadily, calm and deadly
Spatter-head lyrics I lick through your transmit
MCs submit to the will as I kill your
Juvenile freestyle, civilize the mental
Devils worship this like an icon
Bear-hugging mics with the grips of a python

[Hook: (first two lines)]

[Verse 4: Cappadonna]
You heard other raps before but kept waiting
For the Son of Song, I keep dancehalls strong
Beats never worthy of my cause, I prolong
Extravaganza, time sits still
No propaganda, be wary of the skill
As I bring forth the music, make love to your eardrum
Dedicated to rap nigga, beware of the fearsome
Lebanon Don, Malcolm X beat threat
CD massacre, murder to cassette
I blow the shop up, you ain't seen nothing yet
One man ran, tryna get away from it
Put your bifocal on, watch me a-cometh
Into your chamber like Freddy enter dream
Discombumberate your technique and your scheme
Four course applause, like a black jack to dat
You're stuck on stupid like I'm stuck on the map
Nowhere to go except next show bro
Entertaining motherfuckers can't stop O
In battling, you don't want me to start tattling
All up on the stage cause y'all snakes keep rattling
Bitch, you ain't got nothing on the rich
Every other day my whole dress code switch
So just in case you wanna clock me like Sherry
All y'all crab bitches ain't got to worry
Can't get a nigga like Don dime a dozen
Even if I'm smoked out I can't be scoped out
I'm too ill, I represent Park Hill
See my face on the twenty dollar bill
Cash it in, and get ten dollars back
The fat LP with Cappachino on the wax
Pass it in your thing, put valve up to twelve
Put all the other LPs back on the shelf
And smoke a blunt and dial 9-1-7
1-6-0-4-9-3-11
And you could get long dick Hip Hop affection
I damage any MC who step in my direction
I'm Staten Island's best son, fuck what you heard
Niggas still talking that shit is absurd
My repertoire, is U.S.S.R
P.L.O. style got thrown out the car
And ran over by the Method Man Jeep
Divine can't define my style is so deep
Like pussy, my low cut fade stay bushy
Like a porcupine, I part backs like a spine
Gut you like a blunt and reconstruct your design
I know you want to diss me, but I can read your mind
Cause you weak in the knees like SWV
Tryna get a title like Wu Killa Bee
Kid change your habit, you know I'm friends with the Abbott
Me and RZA rhyme name printed in the tablet
Under vets, we paid our debts for mad years
Hibernate the sound and now we out like bears
In Born Power, born physically, power speaking
The truth in the song be the pro-black teaching[Intro]
Ohh mad one
We see your trap
You can never escape, your fate
Submit with honor to a duel, with my son
I agree

I see you're using an old style, I wondered where you'd learned it from
You know very well, it's yours too
Heh, I had forgotten, will you show me?
And what have you come for?
You come here, since you're so interested - fight me

[Verse 1: GZA]
Yo, Picture bloodbaths and elevator shafts
Like these murderous rhymes tight from genuine craft
Check the print, it's where veterans spark the letterings
Slow moving MC's is waiting for the editing
The liquid soluble that made up the chemistry
A gaseous element, that burned down your ministry
Herbal vapors, and biblical papers
Smoking Exodus, every square yard is plush
Fuck the screw-faced photo sessions facial expression
Leaves impressions, try to keep a shark nigga guessing
Give crazy shouts Son here's the outcome
Cut across the semi-gloss rhymes you floss
Shit is outdated, just like neckloads of Sterlings
Suede-fronts, bell-bottoms, and tri-colored Shearlings
I ain't particular, I bang like vehicular homicides
On July 4th in Bed-Stuy
Where money don't grown on trees and there's thieving MC's
Who cut-throat to rake leaves
They can't breathe, blood splash, rushing fast
Like running rivers, I be that whiskey in your liver

[Hook: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Duel of the Iron Mic!
It's the fifty-two fatal strikes!

[Verse 2: Master Killa]
This is not a eighty-five affair, made clear
When the Gods get on to perform storms blew up
Wu's up, causing the crowd to self-destruct
Killer bees are stinging while I reveal
Science, that's heavily guarded by the culprit
Bombing your barracks, with aerodynamic
Swordplay, poison darts by the doorway
Minds that's laced with explosive doses
Damaging lyrical launcher
Lunge at the youthful offender then injure
Any contender, testing the murderous Master
Could lead to disaster, dynamite thoughts
Explode through your barrier, rips the retina
Who can withstand the astonishing punishing
Stings to the sternum, shocked in the hip-hop livestock
Seeking for a serum, to cure em

[Verse 3: Inspectah Deck]
Adults kill for drugs plus the young bucks bust
Ducking handcuffs, throats get cut when dough rush
Out of town foes look shook but still pose
We move like real pros through the streets we stroll
Bullet holes lace the windows in one-six-oh
So control the avenues that's the dream that's sold
Building lobbies are graveyards for small-timers
Bitches caught in airports, K's in they vaginas
No peace, yo the police mad corrupt
You get bagged up, depending if you're passing the cut
Plus shorty's not a shorty no more, he's living heartless
Regardless of the charges, claims to be the hardest
Individual, critical thoughts, criminal minded
Blinded by illusion, finding it confusing

[Hook x2]

[Outro]
Huh, Master, he must be dreaming, heh
Well, if he is dreaming then he must be asleep
And if he's asleep, then I will wake him up!

At the height of their fame and glory, they turned on one another
Each struggling in vain for ultimate supremacy
In the passion and depth of their struggle
The very art that had raised them to such Olympian heights was lost
Their techniques vanished[Intro: ‘The Killer’ sample]
And in our line of work we need all the help we can get
Tony Wing’s the name. He works for a drug ring in Central America
Who wants to kill him? No information, say yes or no
1.5 million
All right, you get what you want, moneys no object. They’re all clean
No serial numbers. Untraceable. And there explosive head bullets, your favorite
I felt someone walk over my grave. You want to change your mind?

[Rae] Yo son criminal is blowin the fuck up
[?] yo diamond
[Rae] Yo shit happen man, what up man, yo yo yo
Here come the Starks, come here son come here for a minute

[Hook: Method Man]
Who come to get you, none, they want guns
I be the first to set off shit, last to run
Wu roll together as one
I call my brother Son cause he shine like one

[Verse 1: Method Man]
Scriptures hit the body like sawed-off shotties
Like my hair knotty and my nosepiece snotty
Fuck a nigga hottie, that ho pussy probably
Burn like the deserts of Mogabi, for real
Ain't nothing fraudulent here, we pioneer
Commandeer a new frontier, this be the Wu yeah
36 Chambers of fear, huh you lost it
Information leaking out your faucets, hmm
Time to forfeit your crown and leave the grounds
There's a new sheriff in town holding it down
It's the two holster, shit shot smoker
Wanted dead or alive, bounty on the poster
Wild in the West, a student of my culture
And life is the test, hold up
Let a nigga catch his breath
I'm still paying dues and the last one is death
Back to the essence with that shit you stressing, this rap profession
Now peep Tical, the son of the Shaolin Isle
Bless my style, criminology pays
The last times and days, Johnny fucking Blaze

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
This goes for niggas who know
Wu will blow like yayo, lay low
Plus cooling in Barbados
Ricans be giving me much shit to touch shit
Stay cool Papa, see you with enough shit
Back at the lab a, crack's bagged up
Yo niggas act up, what blow up their workers if they have to
Señoritas, fucking up a storm buying Gods margaritas
Sucking his dick, up in the whip long
Designed for rhyme crime nigga jail time jiggas
Them niggas up in hype Vigors lighting niggas
Silks Wally wear Figaro chain yeah
Jakes beware of black rap millionaires
Rock Airs, leather goose, bears blowing this year
1-800-GAMBINO niggas, yeah

[Meth]
Wu roll together as one, I call my brother Sun cause he shine like one

[Verse 3: RZA]
Solid gold crown is shining, we're blinding like some diamonds
I'm reclining in the sky on a cloud with silver lining
Double breasted, bullet proof vested, well protected
The heart, the rib cage, the chest and solar plexus
Casting stones, cracking two-hundred and six bones
And watch your ass get blown to a sea of fire and brimstone
How dare you approach it with them poems
The overfiend like noah bean green souls with a soldier mean
The grand exquisite imperial wizard or is it
The Rzarector come to pay your ass a visit
Local bio-chemical, universal giant, the black general
Licking shots at Davy Crockett on the bicentennial
Happy Millennium two thousand microchips two shots of penicillin
Goes up your adrenalin son it's time for bouting
It's a model you're resembling the niggas who like following
Trapped inside your projects like a genie inside the bottle and

[Verse 4: Masta Killa]
God stepping forth upon holy down of the track
It's the sound that surrounds and hurts me like I'm under attack
So I decided to bite down on the mic
So the pain of the track won't deny the fact that I'm the master
For what lurks, is an expert that hurts
The individual who tries to visualize under
Cause I strike, like thunder
Niggas couldn't stand my heat, it's unbearable
My wisdom fucks up your respiratorial
Systems are fractured by the killer tactics
Style is ragged and thoughts are mad jagged
Enter the entity, my vicinity
Is three hundred and sixty degrees of humidity
Represent the school of hard knocks and Glocks my
Clan is hostile and got mad moss for blocks so
Feel the force of impact from the iron side of
The gat as I attack the track
From the blind side of the pack, Starks pass the chrome
Watch a nigga get blown out his motherfucking dome-piece
Deceased, laid to rest

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Ghostface Killah]
Yo, aiyyo I got this under my wing, move give me room
Holding up your saloon, clean sweep, like a broom
Full moons make me howl like a wolf out of breath
Sold only new vocal cords you heard Genius on Gef
So step back, to the lab at, high velocity
My teammate, enhance cells more like a pharmacy
Fuck Geraldo, Pablo's plan bro is Bravo
Goodfellas we know, best sellers become novels
The man rocking head bands, silk scarves and jams
Early 80's British Walkers, playboys, mocks and shams
The laser beam vocalist does well at symphonies
Bad days, watch me snatch ice right outta Tiffany's
Remember them kids that came off with eight million
Robbed the Brinks and I labelled in royal pavilions
Them flower heads must have been stupid
Tell me how the fuck black niggas get caught with all that loot kid
There's jet money, underground money
Submarines and rings too bad you fucked up dummies[Intro]
Yeah, yo son you gotta take me to get them Clarks, man
Yo, check it out, yo
Yo, I got a new, yooo! Niggas don't even know son
Yo check the joint, boom
Yo I got a crazy idea how to do Clarks now
Check it out, boom, this is how you freak 'em, boom
You go get you go get the cream joints right? Boom
Now now, all you all you dye, is this shit right here, boom
And this, you know what I'm saying? Any color you want
But it'd be like, blue and cream, you know what I'm saying?
Shit like that, niggas don't even know
But son word is bond I'ma rock niggas this summer
On the real, know what I'm saying?
Yo son, I had crazy visions
Check it out check it out check it out, boom
Just imagine if you buy, woo! Check it out
Just imagine you bought navy blue, right
A navy blue, a navy blue pair right, boom
Of this, of this shit, know what I'm saying?
But dyed get this dyed cream on top
Just imagine that color like
But you got it dripping like it's marble cake like...

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Stand on the block, Reebok, gun cocked
Avalanche rock get paid off mass murderous services
Chef break 'em, watch the alley cats bake 'em
Four-nine made 'em, drop grenades and take 'em
Quick fast we reflect like the sky be blue true
Wu-Tang saga continue
Rap Meyer Lansky crash your fantasy
Getting high fellas stand by, here's the plan, see
Sit back collecting Tecs and cheques and
Blowing slow in a Montero flexing
Beats break heavily word to INS bless me
Throw me like three bags of cess
For real from the Killah Hill locked and caged in
We're sworn representatives, we acting like made men
Strive for wives, nine lives and lies
Max, sell and enjoy the highs, what?

[Hook: Raekwon and Ghostface Killah]
The treasure is the glaciers of ice, orginal man
Possess the power to hold G's guns and grams
Baker baker, pull off a keystone kaper
Point out the baddest bitch in the crowd and watch me scrape her

[Verse 2: Masta Killa]
Proceed with caution as you enter the symphony
Degrees of punishment increase intensely
Syndrome was caused by the deadly drums
But the battle was won by swords being swung
Slicing with a vocal, from the international vocalist
Your style is too local to fuck with this
Offensive antagonist
No assistance, moving motionless
Mysterious swiftness
Thoughts roll down the shaft of the brain
Mental gives the signal to the physical
Whirlwind kicks and hits from every angle
Violent temperaments left continents dented
Poison vintage wine rhymes I invented
Drunk by the drunken puncheons that punctures the heart
Vital sparks from the arteries stopped

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ghostface Killah]
Straight up and down it's all good
Peace to them cheque cashing, chain snatching, gun flashing
Niggas in the hoods bubbling good
Analyze Starks, who be buying lion heads and Clarks
To all my house bitches, Starks'll be home soon
I'm on tour chill, catch me '96 in June
But until then my ten-man team be safe
Chill on the whips for seven months, we can all get laced
Take a boat cruise, sip daiquiris and max
Swimming pools, fly jewels, Wally shoes, blow stacks
Relax kids, black kids got a craving for Cris
Until we get back and pack, leave the Mac with your Wis'
But whatever, I gotta hit other sides of the Earth
Spread Wu-ness, rule this, civilization's cursed
But luckily I'm born to be wild and then be out
Move crowds collect twenty thou and then be out
Heavy convoys my crew keep pretty boys paranoid
Built like a steroid pat down Dan Aykroyd
My seeds, grow with his seeds, marry his seeds
That's how we keep Wu-Tang money all up in the family

[Hook]

[Ghostface]
My seeds, run with his seeds, marry his seeds
That's how we keep Wu-Tang money all up in the family

[Outro: 60 Second Assassin]
It's been a long time since the father left in '69
It's been a long time since Wu Tang had the chance to shine
It's been a long time since we had diamonds, gold and drink Cristal wine
It's been a long time of walking around here dumb, deaf, and blind
It's been a long time since you had the Son of Man chant like golden wine
It's been a long time...[Dialogue from "The Usual Suspects"]
There's no coke
What
You heard me you dumb fuck, there's no coke
What the fuck do you mean there's no coke
I've been up and down this ship. I've been in every fucking room
There's gotta be coke
There is nothing
Nothing

*heavy panting*
Help PLEASE!
*panting continues*
Help me!
*gunshot*

[Hook: Masta Killa]
It's assassination day, I stalk

[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
I move through the third world, my third eye's the guiding light
Invite the fight, we all die tonight
The life I live's a twenty-five to life bid
Parole reneged, I stroll the globe fugitive
Cream is short, Cee Cipher Power stalk, plus the fiend talk
Three Gs the cost in Supreme Court
White lies and blackmail land me back in jail
We're all for sale, a stolen goal but it fail
Stranded on the front line, I shine to the dumb and blind
It comes time I take back what was once mine
Crunch time in the first quarter, from the worst slaughter
Devil's poisoning the birth water
The earth daughter rest her head on my chest
Through the struggle we cuddle under half-moon crest
While the press plant fear and exploit the gun blasting
Central broadcasting is shackling, nerves are unfastened
Trapped in deep water, gasping
I clash with the titans for my half on the action

[Verse 2: RZA]
I stop producers careers, the weak spot was the ears
Scorpion darts hits the mark, pierce the heart with silver spears
You're bewildered, my unsaturated, low filtered
Devils still feel this so you're living build tilted
MCs upon their axis, their body hazard tactic
Lactic acid, desert dry cactus, practice
You can never match this invincible, Wu-Tang indispensable
One nation under God, indivisible
With liberty and justice, the mic is in my clutches
Thugs who bring ruckus leave in crutches
Unforgivable snakes face the double-edged swords starts to swivel
Decapitates the head, makes the projects more livable
Interchangeable, caution: flammable
My chamber is 99 plus 1  unnameable angles
And strangles, microphone cords start to dangle
Silent as the gases that pass throughout your anal
We creep through your doors
Seep out like sweat through the pores
Destroy your internal organs with the biological warfare

[Verse 3: Raekwon]
First of all before we move on, this shit is like a Yukon, don
Spread it out like Grey Poupon
Splurging, merging in the suburbs
Using this just like an adverb, action word, flowing like a blackbird
God came in, aiming like Terry Bradshaw
He hit the crash bar, stay relaxed God, his shit is smashed Pa
You handle this just like algebra, UFO spot 'em like Galaga
Holding like bullet-proof Acuras
You so fly, yeah right, you want to get me high, yo Bobby
You hear how I'm shooting it like they blue tops
No, you won't play me like your lady
Pay me 380, spit it at you like a baby, final destination Haiti

[Verse 4: Masta Killa]
War's extremely serious and it saddens me
To have to take things to deadly measures
And have you measured and shot for no pay
It's assassination day I stalk my enemy like prey
Tranqued by deceptional sounds that deceives
And lures MCs to the lair
With a mic-like bait, then awaits to be bitten by greed
Temptation tempts my victim to proceed
Forward, ignorance wouldn't allow retreat
You'd rather pursue death than admit defeat
Now who's best to describe for what I specialize in
Murderous rhyming, constantly inclining
My mind spits with an enormous kickback
Your brain didn't absorb the impact
Disorderly conduct from the crowd is the feedback

[Hook][GZA]
Yo, too advanced, Digi' stance, made the CD enhanced
I move with the speed and strength of ants
Identical in form with the Bees they swarm
Hold up, the cold current appear warm
My first verbal brawl, started on some yes yes y'all
To the beat y'all, break your windshield, your jeep stall
Mr. Traffic, dumbin shit, from ecclesiastic
Cashier, holdin out, fine, cut off the plastic
See the logo? A monument in hip-hop
Carved out, in the giant landscape of broken rocks
Whether heard in herb spots, jukebox or malt shops
Uncut live, drop eighty-five, in one shot
Spotlight hits the metal mic, majority stare
Heard the Wu snare, while my iris cut down the glare
Walk a road the great length you find too long to measure
My Clan a make me rhyme like D. Banner under pressure
No surprise, double disc touched five
Those elements kept environments colonized
With the high flying death-defying flow like the Rebel
Right there, but you're one light year from my level

[Ghostface Killah]
Uh-huh.. yeah.. yo.. check it.. yo..
Bottles goin' off in the church, we broke the wine
Slapped the pastor, didn't know Pop had asthma
He pulled out his blue bible, change fell out his coat
Three condoms, two dice, one bag of dope
Oooh! Rev. ain't right, his church ain't right
Deacon is a pimp, tell by his ice
Mrs. Parks said, "Brother Starks, meet you at the numbers spot
Heard you got red tops out, and I want a lot"
Shirley fainted dead on the spot
Two ushers slipped eighty dollars right out the pot
Oh shit!

[Raekwon]
Egyptian, brown skin brown suede Timbs
Masqueradin X-rated throw blades, all occasions
Round nozzle touchdown, Haagen-Daas gobbles White House
Gucci flag on the roof, call us rock groups
Mere intelligent, buy Neimann Marcus out
No doubt, all we saw he bought, Lori mom's all blow
Was simple, blamp instrumentals run camps the stamps get you
The way we lamp, fans come and get you
Play, fullback strapped like a fuck, war at
The black, Carlo Gambino's stash house in Hackensack
Pack capsules, Green Bay 'em lay 'em down like wax do
It's all actual we build, like Crash Crew
Coconut, incense, one sentence, aiyyo
Control the holy flinch hit this, new whips
Roman numerals, sun splash them niggas like, Tango and Cash
Alcatraz cats roll out fast..

[Cappadonna]
Wu thousand nuthin but hardcore
We tryin to get land riches and more
Ghost put me on to it
We just do it, floss or whatever
Take care of the business, there's too many roughnecks
Give two of these to Flex, tell him it's real rap like Ghost
Had to beat niggas with toast
Clubs V.I. clientele we lay it down flat
Pulled out on y'all kid, now where your mans at?
Fakin the real like, "Damn I can't stand Cappa'"
Then my wardrobe flooded the next chapter
Y'all heard about us like we heard about you
Bless the mic with reality, hit you with the virtue
Calm down not tryin to hurt you, burst through
That shit, fatter than all y'all niggas outfits
We the glitch like Y2K
Catch the ball when it drop, guns pop, y'all have a nice day

"Doctor Kanabuta, Iron Man, he is invincible
His remarkable armor is supreme!"

[Masta Killa]
Yo
Sometimes I'm liable to spaz and break fool
Grab my gun, select one, snatch son
Put the barrel by his face, blast one by his eardrum
Piss run, you drop thinkin you shot
Screamin like a bitch, kicks to your face
Shots to the body that shake like the bass
I'm Ghostfaced up, military style down
Nuff ammunitions of rounds across the chest

[Ghostface]
Skip to the intro, rap through po'
Smashed a fresh ball of wax ceasar
Flashy penthouse that overlooks the vista
Wally Moc' half tied, swimmin trunks
Three chunks of ice sit in Johnny Walker for advice
Catch the moment, fundraiser at will, work with the homeless
Polish diamond edge, Flintstone shit, sealed in a comb pick
Carefully, swing the B seven series Christmas lights
Too bright Ghost is comin y'all fix the mirrors
Relax like pudding, confidence strangle my man couldn't
Exile he no longer in the hood
Bless the kid that max the most
Me I turn a wedding into hoax
Roses tied to bombs on posts
On commercial breaks, piss in the apple juice
Rasta nigga rock the big do's
Jiffy Pop it's only chant WuNow number two, practiced the snake style
He was known as the snake spirit
He had the speed of a snake

[Intro: Killah Priest]
Niggas is like serpents out there
[Snake style, no one could compete]
Serpents will bite
Lay outside, and then they roll back into they holes
They slither, in the streets of Brooklyn, New York
Slither in the streets, of Manhattan
In the streets of Queens, streets of the Bronx
Streets of Staten Island
Wherever you see em they slither
Whoever... yo
Fearsome shit... check it out
Yo, yo

[Verse 1: Killah Priest]
It broke me up when they pat me on my shoulder
Said stay strong cuz his life is now over
I flash back to the heathens that he roll with
They shot him up and down nobody knows shit
My peers, little ears
Came up to me with a eye full of tears
Last night we was shootin dice and gettin nice
Kid rolled us, played us for our merchandise
We were in the hallway all day
Me, Steve, and Little Ray
Probably at first they tried to rob me
Back me in the lobby, pull out the shotty
Then came Scotty, fragile body
My first impression, he returned from a party
He would just stagger, smellin like Bacardi
The Dragon, braggin, how he was fuckin mad hotties
Pressed on the elevator button, then all of a sudden
He licked off, about a dozen
Slugs from the cannon, that ripped through my cousin
Nobody was standing when the nigga started bustin
Blood started to flood the floors by the elevator doors
That's the last thing that I saw
Damn, we planned to make grands of our own

[Number two]

[Verse 2: RZA]
Jagged edge, rockin God, hard as Stonehenge
Pledged whoever crossed his path get scrapped with a sledge..
..hammer, he didn't give a damn about the manner
And on the block he was called by the momma's and the grandma's
Indecent, heathen, juvenile delinquent
His weekends was frequently, locked inside the precinct
His most recent cape for catchin papes
Was snatchin up snakes on a roof butt-naked hang em off like drapes
Then ask what's the combination to the safe, with the brace
And those who didn't reply they fell straight to their face
Razor blade sharp who invades the dark
And raid more spots than Spays and NARCS iron heart like Tony Starks
A fierce lion, who never leave the crib without the iron
And on the block he be slingin rocks and duckin from the sirens
Greetin niggas he loved with a pound, and a bear hug
Those who wanted life, they catch a slug from the snub
A Five Percent, who all knew was one to ten
He loved the Gods with his heart but his brain was filled with sin
And when he came through niggas be lookin out
Hopin he gets shot or tooken out, or locked the fuck up in Brooklyn House
In PC, on a liquid diet, but he was louder than a riot
[Number two, the snake]

[Verse 3: Masta Killa]
Do the knowledge to a nigga named Trigga
Bad rude boy from the land of Jamaica
With visions to venture, to the U.S
To receive the gold that he couldn't acheive
In his country, even though he sold mad weed
For the next man, who was the Don of the clan
Niggas actin like they got the block locked
Like I can't sling drug raps and eat food
But I be the rudest, bad boy steppin gun totin
Shots lash out like a violent explosion
At the nigga, who tries to stop my production
Intervene the scene and slow up the cream
None of that black, East New York, gun talk
Niggas I extort from Baltic to Boardwalk
Memories of injuries wounds and burns
Walkin' through the streets of Medina I stand firm
Cause I know this, which means I can hold mine down
Without a doubt, niggas who front, get snuffed out
Justice must be born there's no escape
Cause a snake can't be reformed so I wait
Comin' in the name to proclaim your fame for protection
And you don't know no fuckin' lessons?
[Number two, the snake]

[Verse 4: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Bad, bad, Leroy Brown
Baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than the deep blue seaaaaa
Badder than you and meeeeee
Niggas comin thru the trees, like a salamander, bitin'
Like a piranha, but I'm bitin' you back, like a black pantha
The style I'm ampin' the... fuck my name, who I be?
Fuck the game, it's all about the moneyyyy!
Owahhaerahh, sometimes I get high with the Meth
Then I turn to the Killah Priest
When it comes TWELVE O'CLOCK!!
I turn into the demon beast, yo
Yo fuck that shit!
[Number two, the snake]
YO! SHOW THESE MOTHERFUCKERS WHAT TIME IT IS
[Number two, the snake] Rawwrarrrah
Rahhwarwaahauh, rawwaroar!!
WHO's THE BAD-ASS? *rawharrah*
WHO's THE BAD-ASS?
[Now number two] Rawwwaahrah
[He practiced the snake style
He was known as the snake spirit] YEAHhhhhh

[Verse 5: Buddah Monk]
Lyrics, never waitin, twelve days, penetrated
When I come with the ruffness, mad niggas try to rush this
Slip into my killings, then I slays and you're helpless
When I try to stay sick, it's yacub grafted six
Calm for the kill, knowing the style that's ill
When I drop, lyric skills, brothers say, Buddah chill!!

[Outro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
I don't need to rhyme no more, niggas know, yo!
To all the Wu-Tang Clan members
The Ghostface Killer, the GZA, the RZA, the Ol' Dirty Bastard
The Method Man, the Chef - Raekwon, Inspector Deck, U-God
Yo!!![Verse 1: GZA]
Bobby said, "Fuck spending fifty on a whip, buy equip"
Mental flip, he got a thousand tracks stored on a chip
Said he had mad toys to make noise
He split and separate drums like asteroids
The concerned producer sampled this question
Hit him with the beat for the answer with extra compression
My sound travel, it quickly grab you
And equalize the pitch up, until it have you
Bugged out, tryna think you can match this
The portraits are too graphic
Panoramic view for you, stamp Wu
The beats are Gothic, the outcome will be catastrophic
We roadblocked it, checkpoints on your next joint
Now who the nigga you anoint?
700 volts on the track to slay
Murderous wordplay displayed from killing cascades
Throwing bullets in the air to test wind
Which way the cyclone spin? Counter or clockwise?
Still civilized
Kill spies on the wall as still flies, all dies

[Verse 2: Masta Killa]
Give no extension on the lynching
It's tension if the name of the Clan is mentioned
It's the aura that's felt that causes one to flash his gun
And reveal how he really feel, confirmed
He'll never live after the show
See the promoter for the dough I'm taking, breaking his wax
Throwing my shit on to perform the selection from the Swarm
Day 2 breaks, it's a stormy Monday
My ninjas lay in ravines and ditches underneath shrubs and leaves
They breathed through underwater reefs
The enemy walks above, Clan remains subterraned in mud
Off shore banks, tanks approach the location
Bombarded by the circle of death formation
Telecom lines are sniped from these low altitude strikes
Shattering bulletproof helmets with shrapnel fragments of cell
Inhale these venomous thoughts that I propel
Through the north facility, the city must suffer
At the hand of the Chief's command, volts are sent
At three minute intervals the heat intenses
Deadening the power from electrical fences
Defences are down, shake a nigga up
Bounce him off the sound

[Interlude: Killah Priest of Sunz Of Man]
You know what I'm saying?
The God ca-diver, in the streets of Iris
We talk about sex, money and drugs
(Ruled by power) And y'all cats don't know
What it's about (Love and power)
It goes deeper than what you see on TV
Killah Priest, come on

[Verse 3: Killah Priest]
Burning desire, ebony eyes
Painted toenails, legacies die
Women by the well, Egyptian queens
Arabian sheiks paid to knock off rich kings for the joy some sing
Graveyards filled with scarlet widows
Who stabbed they husbands sleeping on silk pillows
Blood on they robes, disguised as beggar in cheap wool clothes
Lambs and wolves in black hoods pull out they gats
Like magic wands, casting spells, sending niggas to Hell
Trapping they souls in realms
Baptize them with Holy Water
Springing on the heads of plenty witches' daughters
Interviews with the richest reporters, silent nights over Nevada
A thousand Muslims bow before the Kaaba
Hebrews flee to the hills of Masada
For the love of God, guns make a loud sound
I'mma show you how thugs get down
Shootouts, bullets turn into bloodhounds and hunt you down
Cursed nation, lost generation
X-Files found them in the future as cosmic rulers
Fallen angels from space intruders
Dying saints, blood spilled on the floor like wet paint
See it in the pictures, read it like the lost scriptures
Absorb it with your 100 proof liquor

[Verse 4: Njeri Earth]
I shot the sheriff and the deputy secondly
Threatening the lives of those who threaten me
Lessening my chances of defeat by predetermining the victory
As taught by Sun Tzu in the chapter, after the third one
I heard my word shall be born, regardless to anything or anyone
Or else I die by the gun, my life has just begun
Thought I was living all along, but I was wrong
This long road I have to travel in countless battles
These filthy snakes with poison fangs and rattles
Kings, queens and pharaohs change to cattle
Unable to duck the Devil's arrow
Singing that his eye's on the sparrow, mind narrow
Superstitions, horoscopes and tarots
'Hark Heralds Angels' and Christmas carols
Graven images hang from the mantels
Man-made slaves in modern day Babel
Brought from Africa in golden robes and sandals
By wicked thieves and vandals
Who manhandled us with leather whips and burning candles
And rambled through our castle, leaving niggas shambles
Stole our golden sodas like some Arab camels
We gazed, amazed and baffled as he loaded his ammo
Into the barrel and blasted out our bone marrow
We were the Gretel and the Hansel, tricked by this wicked jackal
Children of my grand-old-daddy have me
In mind when they're lost in this wilderness blind[Intro: Timbo King]
Comin' to get this money, money
Knock, Knock nigga
Aiyo, aiyo

[Verse 1: Timbo King]
I be where the dough at and where the dough at, a ho at
I grind for real, y'all niggas know that
Cause slow money's better than no money
I keep a hustle, strong-arm block muscle
Hand me those things, what's poppin' my nigga?
Po-po watching again
Put the heat and the work in the stash, Fatty got us
I wish somebody would try to rob us
Them bootleg CDs, two for five dollars
Advances, leather [?]
I'm gettin' my dick sucked by belly-dancers
All hood, yeah, pop got the gambling spot back
Roll up a wood, smoke berries, my team 'bout paper
At first you don't succeed, strive again
That Gin and Grapefruit, rockable blend it's grown B.I
Brownsville, all the way to Portland, you know us
The ice don't melt but it felt like you know us
Yeah, you go under the ground
If you didn't know me then Pa, you knowing me now
I been poppin' those and them ho's been knocking those
Shows outta state, West bubble fuck
With big hummer trucks, gangsta life, live big
That's my word to Big, I send shots to your ribs
See if you can spot the red beam
I'm parked right in front of the spot inside a red Beam', nigga

[Interlude: Timbo King (Masta Killa)]
(Yeah, yeah, we'll pass this off)
Yeah we got this pick up
After we pick this up everything gon' be good
(Watch yaself)
Yo watch those two cats over there
They funny facin' right now, they funny facin'
(I got that)

[Verse 2: Masta Killa]
I started out workin' a ho, moved up to a runner
Hustled for material wealth, put bullet-proof tires on the Hummer
Straight to ya gate I deliver, flow like the Kwantung River
Murdered for a few tails of silver
Code:Red, swingin' on ya head, it's all actual, the murder capital
Group emcee killers, masters, pros and villains
Mic snatchers, dark like a hatchet
Flash ya ratchet, whether steel or plastic
Check the regiment
Peace to Almighty Infinite from the Desert
What's the science Wu-alliance?
On the Ave, I heard son got stabbed up at the party
Never, the God too clever
He seen it comin', they thought he was slippin'
'cuz he's rockin' a drunken', hand on his gun and
Eyes red ready to dead whatever movin'
Against the Armoured Truck, people that he moved wit'

[Interlude: Masta Killa (Timbo King)]
Just make sure my money's right, how I move
(Yo the money's right)
The money there look easy, smooth and deadly

[Timbo King]
At the Plaza, high with her friends
She from Brazil and she likes men with Indian skin
How, the fuck are rap niggas goin' to trial?
Was that easy like burnin' an Owl or turnin' a dial
The body you do's, we body you dudes
We robbin' you, dealin' death and you outta ya shoes
Who's on first, now who's on second?
I'm on third, I'm not playin', them Ninas got 'em all prayin'
God please save me, them Brooklyn niggas, they all crazy
Both eyes hazy, now who the fuck want it?
We gamblin' grands, me and my mans
We got the block on watch for them D's in them vans
Now that's my word, that's my word
Twenty a gram, fuck that, thirty a bird
Flip somethin', respect the juks
This here's supposed to happen
Now who the fuck wanna start rappin'? Then start rappin'

[Outro: Timbo King]
Let's get this money
Divide it by the group
Divide by life niggas
On the grind, block for block
Whatever, whatever
Fort Knox, Knock, Knock, nigga
Timbo King, my nigga Dev One on the track
Definite on the Internet
Definitely, yeah, yeah
Bring it back..[Dialogue from "The Usual Suspects"]
There's no coke
What
You heard me you dumb fuck, there's no coke
What the fuck do you mean there's no coke
I've been up and down this ship. I've been in every fucking room
There's gotta be coke
There is nothing
Nothing

*heavy panting*
Help PLEASE!
*panting continues*
Help me!
*gunshot*

[Hook: Masta Killa]
It's assassination day, I stalk

[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
I move through the third world, my third eye's the guiding light
Invite the fight, we all die tonight
The life I live's a twenty-five to life bid
Parole reneged, I stroll the globe fugitive
Cream is short, Cee Cipher Power stalk, plus the fiend talk
Three Gs the cost in Supreme Court
White lies and blackmail land me back in jail
We're all for sale, a stolen goal but it fail
Stranded on the front line, I shine to the dumb and blind
It comes time I take back what was once mine
Crunch time in the first quarter, from the worst slaughter
Devil's poisoning the birth water
The earth daughter rest her head on my chest
Through the struggle we cuddle under half-moon crest
While the press plant fear and exploit the gun blasting
Central broadcasting is shackling, nerves are unfastened
Trapped in deep water, gasping
I clash with the titans for my half on the action

[Verse 2: RZA]
I stop producers careers, the weak spot was the ears
Scorpion darts hits the mark, pierce the heart with silver spears
You're bewildered, my unsaturated, low filtered
Devils still feel this so you're living build tilted
MCs upon their axis, their body hazard tactic
Lactic acid, desert dry cactus, practice
You can never match this invincible, Wu-Tang indispensable
One nation under God, indivisible
With liberty and justice, the mic is in my clutches
Thugs who bring ruckus leave in crutches
Unforgivable snakes face the double-edged swords starts to swivel
Decapitates the head, makes the projects more livable
Interchangeable, caution: flammable
My chamber is 99 plus 1  unnameable angles
And strangles, microphone cords start to dangle
Silent as the gases that pass throughout your anal
We creep through your doors
Seep out like sweat through the pores
Destroy your internal organs with the biological warfare

[Verse 3: Raekwon]
First of all before we move on, this shit is like a Yukon, don
Spread it out like Grey Poupon
Splurging, merging in the suburbs
Using this just like an adverb, action word, flowing like a blackbird
God came in, aiming like Terry Bradshaw
He hit the crash bar, stay relaxed God, his shit is smashed Pa
You handle this just like algebra, UFO spot 'em like Galaga
Holding like bullet-proof Acuras
You so fly, yeah right, you want to get me high, yo Bobby
You hear how I'm shooting it like they blue tops
No, you won't play me like your lady
Pay me 380, spit it at you like a baby, final destination Haiti

[Verse 4: Masta Killa]
War's extremely serious and it saddens me
To have to take things to deadly measures
And have you measured and shot for no pay
It's assassination day I stalk my enemy like prey
Tranqued by deceptional sounds that deceives
And lures MCs to the lair
With a mic-like bait, then awaits to be bitten by greed
Temptation tempts my victim to proceed
Forward, ignorance wouldn't allow retreat
You'd rather pursue death than admit defeat
Now who's best to describe for what I specialize in
Murderous rhyming, constantly inclining
My mind spits with an enormous kickback
Your brain didn't absorb the impact
Disorderly conduct from the crowd is the feedback

[Hook]I've taught you for three years instructing you in my Poison Clan techniques. We live here in seclusion so we can talk about the clan. The point is I had pupils once. Is that a fact? What are there names? Where are they? I don't know their names now. When they left they all took new names, as the whole idea was to keep their identities a close secret. So even they don't know each other's names. And while they were here they always wore masks to avoid being known. I worry about what there all doing. What I taught them could be used wrongly for evil to hurt men. So then I would like to make sure this hasn't been the case and you will do that for me. Teacher, how will I find them if they've changed their names? And to make it harder they won't show their skills they'll keep them hidden unless it is an emergency. If bad you must kill them[GZA]
Pump and get sumped, you want none
Y'all niggas wanna bring, get done
Flashback, eighty-eight, rag type Volvo
One court solo, slash for logo
Two-hundred hyenas roam the arena
Schemin on a truck Chevy, quit the rush every
Criminal mental, satanic penpal
Wild style on your wax for ten thou'
Most notable, hiphop quotable
See many went, only one got us over do
Floor soakin wet with the drinks and dance sweat
Tell me which click got the deadliest handset
I make the mic pump, force make your feet stomp
Murderous beats move like rope for you to jump
And the two-inch, tighten with the wool-wrench
None qualifyin ass-niggas, the Jon Bentz
Spend it real, 'nuff festivals on the grill
Got a deal, no return with the Brook Shield
Yo

[Chorus 2x: GZA]
Breaker, Breaker 1-9, can't rhyme
Y'all niggas wanna shine, get off blind

[Inspectah Deck]
Yo, I use and abuse all groups and crews
I can't lose, straight up and down, I'm bad news
Like the bears, we eat folks from under the stairs
Pack a hand trigga, scared niggas don't dare
From the rear, I smash thru like a John Deer
Plant a bomb in ya ear, then disappear
With a speed that'll reach mach five
Niggas pop jive, that's why they on the opposite side
Dick riders tryin to make their way inside
Boy analyze, my camp be amplified
Certified live, right before your third-eye
Supply the mental high for the fiendish
Thru the intervenus, see it like a wide-screen Zenith
Got sweetness, wanna show me your cleavage
Leave it to the specialist, leave your wig split
Leavin no witness, it's a mean business
We mean business, invest in cream
Till my exit scene, I stay plottin on my next scheme

[Masta Killa]
Next scheme
Blessed with the art to pierce and shoot dart
I toke the bass, put your shovel to the Rebel
Allah Just, embrace his face with the metal
Danger, woman adore to the chamber
Let this nigga run out wild with the banger
Hiphop socialize, enterprise, snubs in the club
Twenty wizards, about 300 niggas inching your square
Or could it be the armory?
Fifty-two low hand, touch the ground
Strike his knee, pass the heat to my man
Windmill backhand bust your nose gland
Mic stand, might crash a wild fan
The Aqua, city of Atlantis, mantis, flying locusts
Surround the oppose, a bomb only has one time to explode
I blow and break and quake your whole state
Throw the shit on DAT, and make me a fuckin tape

[Chorus][Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Ol' Dirty kickin' your ass
The things that you learnt in class, is trash
You can't do nothing with it, I put you in the past
The pilgrim muthafuckas -- shut the fuck up!
I do it to you bad luck, the hair get plucked
The only thing on your brain is to give me this cash
And stay out of business, cuz I'm takin' your cash
This world belong to me, none of y'all free
I got y'all in -- slavery
The habit of breathing, the hope to find
That you're misbehaving, Link your Cuban
Fuck your booing, flash the burners
On your crewing, cuz I'm much different from
The other M.C.'s, I got the amazing ability
I get on the mic, so you can have a ball (break that break)
I can fly through the air and stick to the wall
I can take a punch, or get hit by a car
Could go to the nearest or farthest star
As a matter of fact, that's what I won't talk about
How I'm going outer space, just to be in the house
How I'm going outer space, ---- -- be in the house

[Hook 7X: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Break that break (nah-nah-nah-nah)

[U-God]
I'm that mic enhancer, the beat programmer
When Ason Unique speak, he throw hammers
And we go bananas over old school breaks
I take an old school loop and break it on yo face
I start from a clean slate, bang you on the waistline
Deep Space Nine, Math smash the bass line
I break spines, til they fraction or splinter
I want Michael Jackson money, just a fraction of Thriller
Deep in, the laboratory, manufacture the Zilla
Cock, notch category, capture the realer
We the ex-drug dealers, still serving them fiends
With TV's in the car, the size of movie screens
You know the routine, give 'em what they need
That disco shit, satisfaction guaranteed

[Hook 7X]

[Masta Killa]
Yeah, 1-2-3, microphone check
In the place to be, as you can see
This is Wu-Tang Clan guest starring M.C
With no harm intended, nobody offended
Carry on with the social, nothing but a party tonight
Special invite, ladies free before midnight
We lock the club down, clash sound hear the guns pop
See D.J.'s spin, counter clock, keep gridlocked
Line around the block, women by the flock
Wanna party with the great, I reap Jamel
Ring bells throughout the state
Diggin' in the crates, for the old school
Remix, nice it up for the people
Ladies want the hardest stiff, to spread eagle

[Hook to fade][Tiffany]
Bobby, I'm tired of yo' shit, nigga!
I'm tired of you comin' in at 3 o'clock in the mornin'
Nigga, you got a family here
You act like you don't fuckin' know that shit
Nigga, what the fuck?

[RZA {*overlapped by Hook*}]
Yo, yo, yo, yo..
Born up in Kings County
Yo, yo, yo..

[Hook 1 - Force MD's]
Digital, these niggas should be crazy
Growin' up as a Brooklyn baby
This how, this is my life..

[RZA]
Yo, yo, yo..
A Brooklyn baby, I was born up in King's County
Inside the womb seven months before the Queen found me
Up in wroughty Brownsville with fiends around me
Now roam gat in Staten with Cream Team around me
They called me Bobby, cousin, really got the black Harley
Taught his son how to snipe cats like Lee Harvey
Oswald, all's well that ends well
My big brother Divine, he pushed the Benz well
I got the cherry Range, broke and rockin' heavy chains
I'm from the tribe of men who would bury Kings
On the back of the A-train, my daydream
Should I make a phat hit or should I take CREAM?
From the Clan that taught you Cash Rules
I make soul grind tracks, you grab ass too
Give respect to the Prince when he pass through
Might have a chocolate deluxe in a glass shoe
Cousin Billy, known to strap the black uzi
Shot you in front of the Jakes like Jack Ruby
Live on TV where you see B-O-B-B-Y
D-I-G-I-T-A-L, A-L, things ain't too well

[Hook 1]

[Hook 2 - Force MD's]
Digital, these niggas should be crazy
Growin' up as a Brooklyn baby
This is how I live my life..

[Masta Killa]
Yeah..
Peace Lafyetee, Stuyvessant, Malcolm X
Shot dice on green, we live from Calasky y'all
It's Fred Glassy, zig-zag-zig through traffic
Get the herb, get the God, peace Ra'
What's the word on things?
Through the phone I heard the bangin' sounds
In the background, layin' down
I'm spittin' what the people missin'
We extreme with the murder type theme
Don't sleep, get ya head split to the white meat
Big guns, down South we blaze
Shippin' bodies back up North, it's the Weston
Wild Texan, no trespassin'
Long mics hit the dead arm
Planet Earth, home of Islam
Brooklyn, I was physically born, clothes torn
Rough tacklin' the streets, Allah Math' spine Technics
We bring heat to the block party, drinkin' Bacardi
Baggin' shorties for the homies who ain't here

[Hook - both to fade]

[Tiffany {*overlapped by Hook*}]
Bobby, that's right, you ain't shit, nigga
You ain't shit, but a big dick and a mothafuckin' cheque
All that fuckin' Brooklyn shit, Shaolin shit

What the fuck is up with you, nigga?
You ain't shit, nigga
Comin' in high off that shit
What the fuck?
I'm tired of yo' shit
What the fuck is that shit anyway?
What the fuck?
And your cousin Billy, I'm sick of that mothafucka
That mothafucka could never come up in this
Mothafuckin' house ever again
He's a criminal mothafuckin' gangsta, see that shit?
A criminal, I'm sick of that shit
I'm sick of yo' shit, Bobby {*echoes*}

Rugged Profile peep honey child checkin' my style
Quick Wallets are fuck, slick wit it talk, East New York

Baron Bully, Timberland Boot, Black Hoody, Fitted Black Skully
You still on that bullshit, I can't get it out of me

Uh, we ain't goin' home 'til the last blood's gone
Head strong enough to break Bone

Tell Universe to love and scent
Missed seein' him on the Ave. a little longer and bent
Yea it's another day in the Hood
I got my Money from the Block
Now I'm gon' cop somethin' fly
To rock for the rest of the Week
Prefer heart, not the drop slippin' of to the beat
Not the sweet smellin' sex in my Passenger seat
Pretty feet on my Dashboard sippin' her drink
Pretty Brown Eyes, Pretty Brown Thighs
All Wise Intelligent Eyes
See you spread Butterfly, Pretty ass high
Slang Supreme Marble, I beat the Terrible Reign
Dirty South, Carolina Game, cockin' again
Hear the Guns bust, can be spittin' like this
High risk for MC's vocal anesthetic for your head Rush

Dare a motherfucker to swing

Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding

[Verse 3]
Now you see how the Crowd response when I get on
You'll neva last in this Square when I enter
Brooklyn - also known as Good Lookin'
Crooklyn - slidin' through your Central Bookin'
Knocked on the felony charge that got dropped
So I copped po' basin' wit the Five year pendin'
Can't count the Blessin'
Caught another case in the mix, Now I'm stressin'
Power to the People to Sequel, spark the people
See you at a Town near you, Comin' WU[Intro: Kurupt]

Yeah, you know
The problem with most of these niggas nowadays
They ain't got no respect
See, life ain't just about all that other shit you lookin' at my nigga
You know, I love it on the Westside
That's why I pose with the homies, we smoke, drink, raise kids and make this motherfuckin' money
You hear me?

[Verse 1: Masta Killa]

My killa Cali gangsters a ride for me
Got brothers in the bay that'll die for me
Got the best weed smoke choke no seeds
Mexicans, crip, blood we all one seed
Shout the game, Snoop, Cypress Hill, B Real and real soldiers
Like Pac I still Feel
So I still ride dirty with the 5th steel
Got Kurupt young gotti with the semi shotty
My brother Power in the Maybach counting big money
The Cali sunshine but it ain't all sunny
Brothers dieing everyday and I pray for them
Falling soldiers in my heart where I still hold them
I feel I owe them
My brother coming home
On parole looking swoll
Young and old time to get gold so let's roll
These words that I write and recite is from the soul

[Verse 2: Kurupt]

Indo weed, extra green
Texture, extra, orange and green
Next to Inspectah Deck it seems
The reala Masta Killa and young gotti
I got to hit New York and push pass the kush hash
Big Snoop and Daz want to push past
Indo weed, and feeling fine
I'mma do this shit as well then again at nine
See, I'm cut from a different cloth
Got it? Got it?
I'm cut from a different cloth
Bodyguard hard, you niggas are soft
See you niggas ain't loyal
You don't know how stay down and play your position
Get a new fitting
Fitting the function, you's an undercover clown
I was born to push a concrete line
I change lives, I enhance my eyes
I'm Magneto, Magneto, aniyo
The one that can pose the metal at all times
If you look, you find
Close eyes to blind
Look[Intro: Killah Priest (Masta Killa)]
Let it flow, deh-deh-duh (yeah)
It's on (beh-deh-deh-deh)
(Den-e-neh) on... (yo, aiyo)

[Hook]
Keep on knowing what you know
Keep on knowing what you know
End up, up, up, in chains, chains, chains

[Verse 1: Masta Killa]
Back in '88, son was getting a little paper
Caught a few stings, rocked the phat rope cables
Pushed the white Mercury Sable, known for holding heat
Ferragamo moc's on his feet, serpents whisper
You can smell the deceit, they greet me like peeps, to blend
And try to befriend, to get up, underneath the skin
My long wind'll blow ya head piece degrees
Murder One Team, Barcelini Noodle had lean
Microphone fiend, step into the rhythm
This is how I'm serving them, no need for medic attention
I just murder them, murder them, pussy, I just murder them

[Hook]

[Verse 2: R.A. the Rugged Man]
I'm a dip-dip diver, socializer
I'm a who flat top rule, in eighty niner
They say "Rugged, by now you should have at least blown"
It's funny, I'm mad famous for being unknown
I'm just a dirty motherfucker, they hate my guts
All I talk about is bitches, and busting nuts
Yeah, I got a foul mouth, yeah, I cuss too much
I'm just so Ricky Ricardo, ridiculous
And I ain't got no fly whip, I still ride the bus
I got Mitch Blood Green on the scene with us
Hospitable, hitable, cooler than digable, criminal
Miracle, lyrical, take every syllable literal
It'll riddle, profitable, visible, iritibal
Little brittle pitiful fists will do little but tickle, you typical
Yeah, I talk shit, I'm cocky with it
It's hard for you to admit it, but I'm one of the best in it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Killah Priest]
My mind is haunted, filled with the extension of slaves that's torment
Slow down my steps, one foot from the grave to con it
Our young black males, they lick pon gate
Sun of the morning roasted souls, tell Minister "come pray"
It's gun trade inside of smoky apartments
Flow process, one nine, two tech, four revolvers
Coke overboiling kettles, it's like we struck oil in the ghettos
We supply it to addicts, the devil work
He practice, he's like a search backwards
Til they throw that dirt in our casket, and that's it
I live where the fiends are nothing, just a scene of the projects, similar to
Osama's
An old man, at the top of the stairs, he just stare
Cuz his mind ain't there, victim of the war
Polar signs, the times is near
He drop the jewels, til you buy him a beer
He said he was a linebacker for the Bears
Said he did it all back, while he's drying his tear
Yeah, it's that real shit, that made me
That music from the '80's, the child's of the '70's
I live long til they bury me[Intro: Masta Killa]
We gon' take this back, crazy old school
Off the head one time, get a DJ something to a--
Chika-chika-chika-chika-chicka-chicka-chhhh
Get 'em something to scratch, yaknowhatimsayin?
My nigga Choco, Jam Master Jay on the 1's and 2's
Peace Allah Math, Red Alert, Marley Marl
Kid Capri, Funkmaster Flex and uh, Mr. Cee
I can't forget, Sway and Tech
Jazz Joyce, DJ Clue, Cocoa Chanel
Irief Jamel, I rocks the mic well, well
Rock the mic well, well, well..

[Masta Killa]
On and on, to the break of dawn
Hot Butter on, say what? The popcorn
Freak 'em to the left, while we rock 'em to the right
Brooklyn in the house, who wanna fight?
Can we bounce? Roll to the skate, ya rock?
Hip to the hop and ya don't dare stop
Come alive party people, gimme what you got
I guess by now you can take a hunch
Fine, I'm the ninth member of the bunch
Rockin' old school ain't shit to me
MC's OD on the shit that I wrote
Can we smoke while I'm drinkin'? I'm thinkin' of bonin'
Sugar, I wanna ride yo ass until the mornin'
Leave ya moanin: Jamel Irief, High Chief, comin' outta East Medins

[Hook: Masta Killa]
Ladies in the house if ya clockin' Gs
Sippin' on drink, Long Island Iced Teas
Lookin' real good from ya toes to ya weave
Tell the fellas back up and like let ya breathe
Fellas in the house if ya know ya live
Punch niggas in the face from Cali to Bed-stuy
Handlin' the steel if the shit get real
Just flip a pie and stack ya mil'

[Masta Killa]
Activation, mind starts sparkin'
Constant elevation, sky walkin'
David Thompson, my Wu niggas stompin'
Down the boulevard, shakin' yo ass
You better watch yo self, I'm type slick
With a nice size --- lemme see you work it
She wanna suck it in public
Ol' Dirty Bastard can use it on the visitings, you wit it?
Then holla like wheels on a peel, don't squeal
Just keep it on the 'lils, for the Masta Kill
Just givin' you somethin' that y'all can feel
I see you in the hood, then ya fam from Tilden
Slid through the back of the buildin', heat concealed in
Stare to your place
Rae bomb the elevator, an Incarcerated Scarface, here, taste
The lace from the dominant race to the base
In ya face like paste, baby doll
Uh, uh, uh, uh, yes yes y'all
Welcome to the block party, shots lick off
You might wanna hit the deck, but stay calm
It's only us, every thing's still well plush
We freakin' the streets, the Shiek shows the beat {*echoes*}

[Interlude: RZA (U-God)]
One two, one two
I'mma try this one more time, son
Lemme in there, yo put that nigga back son
(Yeah, hit hard)

[Masta Killa]
Like... hip hop, like socialize
Clean out ya ears and ya open ya eyes
Liquid Sword to the city
Peace Allah Just, that's one of the committee
Let's hook up the 6 for a chess contest
Relieve a little stress
I'll snatch a bag of the Uptown's best
Make ya love it when ya smell it
It's the velvet, block of chocolate for a hundred
Dread' got pounds, if ya wanna get down
Or we can catch 'em on the next round
My universal sound is like world reknowned
World reknowned, world reknowned
My universal sound is like world reknowned {*echoes*}

[Hook][Verse 1: Sheek Louch]
Out the window with that Range or that muscle car
Arm hanging out the window, diamonds in that big Chopard
Weed in the cracked cigar, more sour in the jar
Looking both ways, I'm cautious when I'm (drivin' 'round)
Hoodrats that's fresh, but barely feed their kids
Little kids that's killers and love doing bids
Unemployment lines, Mexicans'll work for nothing
You pray with them, but you don't know who that priest been touching
Liquour stores, strip clubs, filthy whores
Somebody daughter getting ten singles to drop her drawers
Crack fiends buy a new TV for 20 beans
Niggas tryna get money, police (drivin' 'round)
Blue flags, red flags, different gangs
OG's still outside, it never changes
McDonald's, chinese food, a thousand chains
I'm just tryna use my brains when I'm (drivin' 'round)

[Hook: Erykah Badu]
Step in the car and go
Round down by your lady, and I be waiting at the door
We 'bout to go (drivin' 'round)

[Verse 2: Masta Killa]
Look, I'm fresh back from out of state, JFK arrival
A big spliff in my ashtray, July sunny day
And I'm feeling 'ight too, sliding through Medina
I done pushed everything, I love the way the Benz swing
So I turn my music up, caught a thought, wrote it down
I've seen him come back from outta town and get laid down
His music loud, windows down, summer heat vibing
It's live when I'm gliding, I'm smoking while I'm driving
Riding, mini skirts flirting while I'm passing, they waving
I'm leaning hard cruising, grooving to the beat
As I move through these mean streets
I beep at the seeds, stop, bless them with a little gwap
I keep it rolling, picture me trolling the big truck
(?), my cheap skin shearing all the leather
It's a cold world, winter war weather
This is Wu-Block music for the black hooded champions

[Hook]

[Verse 3: GZA]
What is the key to life, with no ignition?
Another jump start, then I'm on my mission
I keep ID, insurance, and registration
Wu music, good hemp for stimulation
Pull out the station, yield to pedestrians
Blacks, whites, Asians, Indians and Mexicans
At the light, a base head, fragile as a Pringle
He asks me "can I spare a change?" I throw up singles
He mimics my song that's on repeat
Addiction so strong, got him in knee deep
Button on his lapel, picture of Obama
Four years later we stuck in the same drama
These streets corners, just overcrowded saunas
Bigger losers drop weight, sweating from the trauma
Education to a thug is well debated
Each crime is kinfolk, all blood related

[Hook]"Do that dance, grown up" - sample repeated throughout the song
[Intro: Masta Killa (Raekwon w/ sample)]

Turn my microphone up a little high..
Yeah.. yeah, yeah, look, party people gath-
Party people gather round
(Do that dance, grown up, do that grown up, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yo, yeah, yeah
Do that dance, grown up, do that dance, grown up
Aiyo, aiyo, aiyo, aiyo)

[Masta Killa]
Party people gather round, watch the God get down
The sound's so rugged, measure the erection
It's raw when I'm sexin' your brain
Cherry cream gleen leather seats, lean
Goose in the canteen, dutch leaf green
Block of the chocolates, ship a mil', box it
Moms and pops it, plan to be seventy five, live and kicking
Jewels drip in the heat --

[Raekwon]
Radioactive, roll that accurate, what?
Roll that backward, flow went back
I stand as a man, the game plan repped your name
The greatest Fam, we play in the sand
Me and Irief, Killa gangsta thieves
Gangsta beats, civilize, great men don't make beliefs
Haagan-Daaz, shake the streets
I'm cocained down, and I got a fire to stretch my eats
West to East, South to North, best, the beats
Rest is tef', the Chef defeats
Order this piece -- yo..
Niggas who ain't real, they real when they call the police, my brothers
Watch the slang, lots of lame, pop your frame
And drop your dame, and chop your name
We locked the game, '89 niggas with oxxes on
In front of the building with the same thing

[Interlude: Masta Killa (Raekwon w/ sample)]
Uh-- yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, get your uh-uh-uh-uh
And... (do that dance, grown up, do that dance, grown up)
Look, look, huh, look, huh, party people gath-
Party people gather round
(Do that dance, grown up, do that dance, grown up)

[Masta Killa]
Party people gather round, watch the God get down
The sound's so rugged, measure the erection
It's raw when I'm sexin' your brain
Cherry cream gleen leather seats, lean
Goose in the canteen, dutch leaf green
Block of the chocolates, ship a mil', box it
Moms and pops it, plan to be seventy five, live and kicking
Jewels drip in the heat, ribbon with a young sweet
Something in the passenger seat, ivory queen
Beat got the Old Man feeling twenty three
Power-U fat as a peach, I'm Chief Jay Strongbow
From the east, come due Allah, what a beautiful squall
Through the Cartier tints, I seen her from afar
She in her mink trench in her panty and bra
Smooth in silk, naturally built, soy milk breast
Gas at the 'hess, split it to the rest
Undress ya'll, and you don't stop, come on!

[Interlude: Raekwon w/ sample (Masta Killa)]
Do that dance, grown up (come on)
Do that dance, grown up

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, I got muscles in my index finger, even my nail is diesel
To scope two, so I could read you
Without a jack, there, I'm still hittin' up people
You were starvin' for beef, I had to feed you
It's funny how Toney got a lot of sons around
Nice dirty crib, with a lot of guns around
Layin' up in Cheetah's, chillin'
Treatin' niggas like cavities, lead rocks'll be in your filling
Bosses, C.E.O.'s, head niggas in charge'll get whacked
Actors, even down to the stars, you'll get clapped
Skip back, I'm not a bullshit rapper
My gun really do go off like that
This is Ghost, high post, get your pot roast coked
When the Glock burst, it's all about clockwork
Fuck around, and go to hell with a hot shirt
I don't go to Chinatown for my fireworks
I go to Achmed, test him for a bomb, first
Make sure he ain't lyin', tell on me, his eye'll squirt
Ghost Deini is real, me and Killa'll peel
Your cap back, and deliver the mil'
Niggas be pullin' out, but they don't use 'em
Big giant joints, they state and lose 'em
The big yellow, this shit'll push your crew in
Look you dead in your face, like "What ya'll doing?"
Ain't killin' nothin', so stop pursuing
Fuckin' with my click, you'll just get ruined
Blowin' the weight, like Breezly Bruin
By the way, who the fuck, let ya'll fools in?[Intro]
Ohh mad one
We see your trap
You can never escape, your fate
Submit with honor to a duel, with my son
I agree

I see you're using an old style, I wondered where you'd learned it from
You know very well, it's yours too
Heh, I had forgotten, will you show me?
And what have you come for?
You come here, since you're so interested - fight me

[Verse 1: GZA]
Yo, Picture bloodbaths and elevator shafts
Like these murderous rhymes tight from genuine craft
Check the print, it's where veterans spark the letterings
Slow moving MC's is waiting for the editing
The liquid soluble that made up the chemistry
A gaseous element, that burned down your ministry
Herbal vapors, and biblical papers
Smoking Exodus, every square yard is plush
Fuck the screw-faced photo sessions facial expression
Leaves impressions, try to keep a shark nigga guessing
Give crazy shouts Son here's the outcome
Cut across the semi-gloss rhymes you floss
Shit is outdated, just like neckloads of Sterlings
Suede-fronts, bell-bottoms, and tri-colored Shearlings
I ain't particular, I bang like vehicular homicides
On July 4th in Bed-Stuy
Where money don't grown on trees and there's thieving MC's
Who cut-throat to rake leaves
They can't breathe, blood splash, rushing fast
Like running rivers, I be that whiskey in your liver

[Hook: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Duel of the Iron Mic!
It's the fifty-two fatal strikes!

[Verse 2: Master Killa]
This is not a eighty-five affair, made clear
When the Gods get on to perform storms blew up
Wu's up, causing the crowd to self-destruct
Killer bees are stinging while I reveal
Science, that's heavily guarded by the culprit
Bombing your barracks, with aerodynamic
Swordplay, poison darts by the doorway
Minds that's laced with explosive doses
Damaging lyrical launcher
Lunge at the youthful offender then injure
Any contender, testing the murderous Master
Could lead to disaster, dynamite thoughts
Explode through your barrier, rips the retina
Who can withstand the astonishing punishing
Stings to the sternum, shocked in the hip-hop livestock
Seeking for a serum, to cure em

[Verse 3: Inspectah Deck]
Adults kill for drugs plus the young bucks bust
Ducking handcuffs, throats get cut when dough rush
Out of town foes look shook but still pose
We move like real pros through the streets we stroll
Bullet holes lace the windows in one-six-oh
So control the avenues that's the dream that's sold
Building lobbies are graveyards for small-timers
Bitches caught in airports, K's in they vaginas
No peace, yo the police mad corrupt
You get bagged up, depending if you're passing the cut
Plus shorty's not a shorty no more, he's living heartless
Regardless of the charges, claims to be the hardest
Individual, critical thoughts, criminal minded
Blinded by illusion, finding it confusing

[Hook x2]

[Outro]
Huh, Master, he must be dreaming, heh
Well, if he is dreaming then he must be asleep
And if he's asleep, then I will wake him up!

At the height of their fame and glory, they turned on one another
Each struggling in vain for ultimate supremacy
In the passion and depth of their struggle
The very art that had raised them to such Olympian heights was lost
Their techniques vanished[Intro: Masta Killa]
Uh, uh, uh, uhhhhhhhhhh! uh uh
Ya'll motherfuckers
Ya'll motherfuckers
Ya'll motherfuckers, Ya'll motherfuckers, don't uh
Uh, uh, uh, uhhhhhhhhhh!
Ya'll motherfuckers, Ya'll motherfuckers, don't uh

[Masta Killa]
Listen all Gangsta and Fellow MC's we now meet
The Threat is now a actual fact and that's the lease
The Lion Pore rippin' your Jaw dismantle face piece
You made out the Herd the scene
My Murder One Team, Something's best untold
Crime Related - I am who I am so fuck it if son stuck it
We all later paid the best - sipped the fine Grapes
My Rugged Lifestyle is survived - I don't Apologize
Hustlers devote I chose, there's no Compromisin'
And the Guns is drawn, shots fired
Son, all my killers is fam, non-hired
Ya'll faggot niggas wait for the sound for the things blast
Wait for the Train to past, Man face down
We straight from the Murder Capitol Town
It goes down - Daily on the regular
Dressed in Assassin attire, the bullet proof rep
Strap 'em wit the Bomb to his body, ain't no comin' back

[Victorious]
Yea, yo these dudes out here ain't fightin' no more
You either dump or run, or go to the law
Me ? - I take it to the furthest son, it's Murder One
Maneuver ruegers, I call 'em Ferguson
You forced my hand to take you off the Earth wit Guns
Justify Homicide that burden is done
I drink that Red one straight out the forces, your boy lost it
I'm on the belt park where the Ratchet I toss quick
I'm Boss Bitch from that East New York
Where that cheap talk get you outlined in Chalk
Step out of line, we put your thoughts on the Sidewalk
You popped your top lock like we popped the Corks
You can catch me in the South on approach wit them Choppers
Or Bring out them Helicopters
Your boy gun dame is hella proper

[K.Born]
Yea, soul Mass photo flash burned hot
Comin' for the kill, faggot niggas head gets chopped
And get rolled from blocks and gets slapped out spots
We in N.Y. keepin' live Brooklyn lick off shots
Make 'em duck talk, roll real slow don't stop
Til they get it and flock, See I aim for top
And Why ? don't ask why, just move wit my flow blow so-so
Watch how careers gets stopped
My Pop spend the seedin' I swam scream, strongest and broke through
Raised by to a General - Physical is holdin' weight
And leadin' the way like a Freight Train
But I jump fast, nigga you here ? You Sure ?
Ain't no horse play, don't play
Murder wit my Minds spray
Give y'all fools lessons of war, no more
From every Land on this Planet Earth
And waters all across, truly yours, the Flames, the Force

[Free Murder]
The Name's F.R.E.E. M.U.R.D.A
My nigga, Aye! The name is Free Murda
Killings is no limit even without C-Murder
We takin' Keith Burners, we don't give it back
It's like the Blocks slow it's hard to get rid of that
Kinda mad wishin' he should've had bigger Gat
Not this little shit could fit in my Fitted Cap
Matter of fact give 'em that, Make 'em do somethin'
But really though yo he ain't gon' do nuttin'
Bangin' me, I popped your bitch and now she shot up
The Name is Free and that's the opposite of locked up
I have you wacked up, they call the Cops up
You need a house worker had that blood moped up
Yea I'm like WHAT ? wit my Glock up
I'm a nut like the shit I get off Cocks up
I just popped up and already done wit you
Should've bring your Pops, the way I been sunnin' you
Came wit your thing, you can't fight you'se a lame nigga
Under the wing like lights on the Plane Nigga

[Killa Sin]
Yo, fuck all the small talkin'
Get on your job or get the walkin'
Major League Batters in here, you steady balking'
The Mack maul cats like dogs or botched abortions
Make blood pour like bottles of bubbly popped the corks on
The war's on
Better believe I get my Stalk on
+Artist of The Year+ enjoy the fall - long
BONG! when it's all said and done I be long gone
Hong Kong gettin' my Cock in twat thru my Long Johns
Same song all around the World like 'Pac did it
Caught a lil half a hundred gram wit the Cop wit it
The Grass that I stashed in the Dash, hit the Block wit it
The Glock that I brought along for the ride, got knocked with it
Now I'm up top tradin' bars with my box niggas
Wit Two Strikes against me ain't no room for the Third
Even the Cops get it, got niggas watchin' they Misses
Doin' a middle harm Legs cocked in the air
Screamin' "Yeah" like Lil John
Should've pawn like Carm styles is on potty train
Shotty's bang, bodies slained, got niggas that could get it on[La the Darkman]

Bear witness to the god, young thugs don't live long
Life is a game of chess ( you play the pawn), knowledge I born
Walk a righteous path, you can never go wrong

Yo east New York gon ?skin connectin me?, this kid live next to me
Manifests ecstacy, to specialize in treachery
Subliminal, wanted to be nuttin, but a criminal
Wit braids, and doo-loo dropped out the eight grade
Tradin rocks, mad obsessed wit guns, was infected
Should of came amongst gods, could of been resurrected
He expected to live long, holdin the Glock
Never opened up his lessons, never took the salat
Robbed a liquor store, the old man knew him since four
Still slapped him wit the toast, and son emptied the cash drawer
Watchin news flicks, what the kid did, gettin famous
Found the owner in the back of the store, left brainless
The stainless was found, in the sewer three blocks down
The DE's flashed his picture around the Polo Grounds
Kicked his grandmother door down, wit a search warrant
Hand cuffed him in his boxers, tipped off by an informer
He was sentenced to thirty-two, quite quality
Allah rules, he should of listened to his jewels

Chorus 2x
[La the Darkman and Masta Killa]
Young thugs don't live long
Life is a game of chess, and you playin a pawn
I be king, listen to the knowledge I born
Walk a righteous path, and you can never go wrong (word up)

[Masta Killa]

This be the dance of the drunken, niggas found slunken
Over the stand room and one to his head black
All those he drove his next destination of home
Suddenly sniped from civilization
Reality starts to set in, his last thoughts
Flashin back to where it all begun
A shorty who slum for a militant soldier
Who made his bones by holdin down the corner
Never turned snitch even though he was pinched by the Feds
He held his weight and did a bid
A two to six, as he sinned from his cell wit a vengence
He held in his heart like a icepick
Physically, he's cut the fuck up
Tryin to maintain but his head is fucked up
To learn, the word on the streets confirmed
Of the sickness, murderin a family member that turn
Informant, he swore to a code of silence
Who broke it, this lead to bloodshed and violence

[U-God]

This chick Iris out in Queens had a cocaine Lexus
Dime sexes, she rock a leather G necklace
Building reckless, Queen kingpin deathwish
Hit women that'll fuck you and return them ya essence
This evil widow, she pulled a fo'-fo' out the pillow
Wit a silencer, la costra nostra cats, they admired her
They hide a force sting to hit the North Region king of teamster
Head C.E.O. of, a major ring but one thing
Lead to another, a leaf, new recover
She got side-swiped, tied up,  he buck fifty cutter
He shot her both knees then, dumper her in the gutter
It was gorry, the top nigga tortured her for glory
But, he let her live so she could about this story[Verse 1]
Yo, when the East is in da house
GOD DAMN! we slam Mic

Rise Lazarus, party wit the God body
Here's a Hotty, see the chief is like a Dr
And I'm gon' Prescribe
Just a thought for you to snort

Now school is in session, take lesson

[Verse 3]
Yo, yo, uh, When the East is da house

Swords kill Hundred Men
Heads roll, knees bend, Times Ten
Flow roll on the ball or in the Pen[Intro: Bounty Killer]

[Bounty Killer]

A guy a look coke, send him go live a Colombia

[Hook]

[Masta Killa]
Wu-Tang sound control America
One operator, one selector
Wu-Tang sound control America
One operator, one selector

Those unaware would not knowledge the square
I linger in the air like smoke, but I'm there
Hard to di-tect yourself
When you can't see clear through the rapid feed, them collie weed?
Original ganja plant, dem bear seed, the aroma
Got me callin my connect, I need a donor
To lace me with pounds from Arizona, the elusive
Bounty and the Masta exclusive
Many entertainer want the chance to bust
But it's only with the Gods I trust, do I puff
Burnin bush from in front ho
Lampin on the Bay of Montego
To a far wind, bringin wallabee Clarks to the starvin
There's no escapin the soundclash
Gun fire shot, I make it hot at Sunsplash

[Hook]

[Repeat Bounty Killer verse]

[Hook][RZA]
Yo, yea check it...yo, yo yo yo
Yo, if you think you can fuck wit the Wu Clan
Get ya nose swolled up like Toucan
If you think you can fuck wit the Wu Clan
You get ya nose swolen up like Toucan
If you think you can fuck wit the Wu Clan
You get ya nose swolen up like Toucan Sam
And we don't give a damn
Bullets soaked in oil so the Tec can't jam
Sippin on Caribbean rum, coconut juice
Smokin on that chocolate stick
Open up two bottles of that brass monkey on some drunkie shit
You R&B fake rappers suck a monkey dick
I'm from back in the days
With the Christmas for haze
On my back, striped out black
You like that?
Seven braids in my head
My girl stays in the bed and she love to lay the eggs

[Masta Killa]
Prepare for the mic onslaught swift with the sword
Slick Lord, holdin my weight homing abroad
The crowd roared for the peeps playing for the streets
I reeped and sewed, scriptures weeved and woved
Behold gold for the people equal
Fresh on the weekend
Wu-Tang, Biggie smalls live at the beacon
Backstage drinks on the house the show was bangin
Brothers Grey Goosin, Wu was Tanquerayin
Allah teaching schools in session
The Gods speakin
I'm just knowledging
Snake handshakes and fake hugs
Waiting for the hour to devour
And splatter ya heads to powder
I'm a slave to the rhythm
But never to a mental deafened power
The hour has come
We got y'all eleven to one son
You done off, too late to break off
Tactics are hazardous to the health, bomb stealth
Rifle stay M-16, know what I mean?
Know what I mean?

A-yo, a-yo, great minds think alike
We used to drink all night
Think about things thats wrong and how to make it right
Ice cold bottles of brass, time flashes
A hundred blunts passes
Before the God asked us
What's the square miles of the planet?
Why is the axis slanted?
How much is covered by water?
How much is granite?
True-I-Master-Equality
God body be flowing like the chi energy inside your artery
Faithful as a polished rock against a tank
The force of my will still kill shooting blanks
Just from the sound alone ya heads blown
Still scorin in the red zone you best of head home
Or get thrown to the dead zone
Son we need to ill, interupt the Grammy show and teach the kids

I grew up around block parties ready to rock
Behind the rope nigga with my rhyme on cock
Verse shot first nigga who had it to pop
The bad weather blew the feathers off a hundred flocks
Seventy precent goose, thirty duck
Get stuck if each link in your chain is truck
Can't come in this rhyme cypher with nine snipers
Charge off the juice from the pied pipers
Grew up around B-Boys, DJ's, MC's
Through rap, never thinking their ways of TV
It was strictly all about about magnificent rhyme clout
The R.E.C. Room, two dollars with the flyer, three without
Now it's wigs pushed back, name's removed
Off the plaque, too wild to reanact
With tax, thats the price to pay, my goal is to
Aim and spray; my night is the same as day

[Hook x2: RZA]
Yo Just', what we stand for?
What we strive for?
What we live for?
What we give for?
What we die for?
Strictly fam members only
Strictly fam members only[Verse 1]
The royal prince blessed me with the Gita for my physical
Won't give up, such value hosts countless of amounts of treasure
When I'm writing, so quenching to the thirst
So refreshingly enlightening and geniously exciting
Stimulating brain growth is all so relevant
For the youth development
So I drop musical notes for you to then quote
I gave the thought time to soak
While I smoked, meditated then I wrote
For years, months and days, before I even spoke
Test the climate of the people in search of what's missing
Then provide the lesson best for those that are listening

[Hook]
So emcees wonder how me and 9th Wonder
Make the ladies shake it in the club like thunder
My rhymes will beat fire out of something, no question
And 9th will make musical hits for you to listen

[Verse 2]
My winds blow EF5, there's nowhere to hide
I'll seek and destroy your toy
Rapper emcee who's thinking that he's live enough to survive
The mental of assault of rhyming, the timing
Travelous beats is blinding
I've been trying to slow it down in hopes that you could relate
But the slowest I can go is knowledge, there's no escape
So whenever I decide to escalate and land on
Atomically a storm is forming then born
You know it's my duty to warn them of this wicked
Before I have to ice pick it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
See I could just let the beat take control
While I stand with this mic so tightly that I hold
The hundred grand in the rubberband won't fold
This is Sun ray showers of gold, my black merry balls
Some things better untold, not even soul
Y'all know the God black ain't cold
Yellow Bally's with the white soles, silks and gold
Y'all don't even know the way we used to flex and roll
My brother wonderful
Known to keep it stacking, spray the mac in his young day
Sean dude show me the 52, I gots to
Generate revenue, I must do capital

[Hook]
