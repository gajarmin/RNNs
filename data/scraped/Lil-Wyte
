[Lil' Wyte]
Go on and slip me two Xanax Bars - I'm ready to git fool
5th of Crown to wash it down, I'm downtown snapping rolls
Ain't no shame up in my game - in fact I'm mentally deranged
Oxycontin in my system - man I'm feeling kinda strange
Watch me choke about this dope - Blueberry from Texas
You wanna git up in rotation that's too bad cause I'm stressing
By now its 1:30 am - 11 Percocets just entered me
15 minutes from this second - I'll be crawling on my knees
Laughing at the crowd of all the clowns that be surrounding me
Take another Lortab to calm me down and let me see
Body be relaxed - muscles be loose, and you have stopped the pain
No more bitching 'bout your day and work and driving in the rain
Put up wit' the fussing and discussion - I plant in your brain
Hypnotize ya minds, like all the rest but I come through the veins
Take a chill pill to slow me down and git back in this game
Gotta be up on ya P's and Q's to even feel it mane

(Chorus 2x - [Lil' Wyte])
Oxycontin - Xanax Bars - Percocet and Lortab
Valiums - Morphine - patches - Exctacy - and it's all up for grab
What'cha want - what'cha need - hit me up I got you mane
What'cha want - what'cha need - hit me up I got you mane

[Lord Infamous]
Scarecrow, scarecrow whats that you popping?
A powerful pill they call Oxycontin
But it's so tiny, that it catch you dragging
Haven't you heard big things come in small packages
I prefer the orange's with the black O-C
Take two and you cannot move up out your seat
Some people melt em' down in a needle and shoot 'em up
But I pop 'em with Seroquel like glue, I am stuck

[Crunchy Black]
See I'm a pill popper - so I'mma keep poppin' em
Gimme 20 Xanax and I'mma start droppin' em
There ain't no stoppin' 'em - when they in my system
Mane I really miss 'em - can you help me get some
I heard you have Clidina, on that fucking pill shit
Gimme some fuckin Ec' - gimme some Percocets
I need me some four bar, so I can break down
Cause a nigga like me 'finna take it to funky town

(Chorus 2x - [Lil' Wyte])
Oxycontin - Xanax Bars - Percocet and Lortab
Valiums - Morphine - patches - Ecstacy - and it's all up for grab
What'cha want - what'cha need - hit me up I got you mane
What'cha want - what'cha need - hit me up I got you mane[Intro: DJ Paul]

Couple hundred rounds gunned you down, shit's just like some missiles
Man you ain't get no drank, niggas ain't getting no cake

Oh we in the game and them niggas that focus on somebody that playin' with yall so gucci

Not only a threat, I'm also the best
You gon' have to learn to accept it like death

[Verse 2: Koopsta Knicca]
Which one of you fuck niggas wanna test me
Real gone, will be, they will call the police
Sirens off, keep this bitch up out this ho
I had to show [?]
North Memphis beatdown, caught em on the rebound
Death Tone, Funky Town, right now gun sound
Dead men, broke bars, more to get pulled apart
Koopsta too hard, my god, body parts, body parts

[Verse 3: Skinny Pimp]
Chrome 40 mag, when you got 'em stuck
Ran through the hood, then you ran for the door
Got a whole lot of bands but it's not for sale
Real street niggas don't hide here
Ducking and dodging the cops and shit
[?]
But it bounce right back at big Mafia six
They can't keep Skinny Pimp in this bitch
With DJ Paul, Gangsta Boo, Scarecrow, Crunch' and Koop
We breaking the law, damn they down my door, it's a fact y'all
We turning it up, put to hood [?]
All of us gots a plug
Niggas ain't got no money but still trying to fuck with us

[Verse 4: Lil Wyte]
And I got that thang changed, I hope you ready for what has begun
Dumped all this body parts in my trunk, and I did that there just for fun
Mom told me a long time ago "The respect will come", and it's finally here
I got blonde hair [?] blood is that pure
Now I'm all the way gone ho when you need this shit
Get blessed like you done sneezed or some shit
I'm starting a new religion and The Scarecrow will be my beacon bitch
Mafia for life with me, my third I will always see a six
I'm fully involved will all of this, it's Lil Wyte till I'm deceased bitch

[Verse 5: Crunchy Black]
I'm all about my business, I'm all about my bread
Shoot these motherfuckers head in the head
I'mma make sure all you motherfuckers dead
Catch a nigga slipping, hit him with the bat
Duct-Duct tape them, that's what I said
Check from over there, look up under the bed
All a nigga came for was motherfucking bread
Mafia Six in this motherfucking bitch

[Verse 6: La Chat]
La Chat bitch, I'm wrecking shit
Bitch talking, texting and shit
[?]

Lips still in my game mane, right hand's my gun hand
Fucked up, we getting fucked up, that bull shit, fuck you say?
Bodies we be slaying, fuck you we dump them in your trunk
No remorse for all these haters, run them down like Forest Gump
Crestwood is my hood, and I rep it all day
I'm the madest desert eagle till the twos wanna play

[Verse 7: Project Pat]
Pat'aahh
Chopper on the floor, work on the stove
Loud to my lips, smoke out my nose
All these bands, I be jugging on my hustle, on my pan
You get fucked up little pussy with my fingers on this hand
Cut the grass like a lawnmower, like a rake
Faught you niggas like Django, quick as a snake
Anything for the money, [?]
With the pistols upside your head I'm like death checkmate
Project like the Rolexs and them Breitlings
Duffel bag full of motherfucking dead white meat
Told your bitch pussy [?]
But I smashed on the ass like [?]

[Verse 8: Locodunit]
Ready for 09's, ain't got a role model
You fuck with my high, you're not going to roll right
Breaking two gold bottles, hang with the real
Chill with the real rockers, killers and pill poppers
We cuffing that shit and them niggas that steal choppers
Fuck you feel about this? Real lane
Scale-A-Ton tatted from my arm, drawn in my palms
Kush inbetween my index and my thumb, exhale from my lungs
Load the Tommy Gun, split the tongues, kill them one by one
Dump all the body parts into my trunk

[Verse 9: Point Blank]
Didn't give a fuck about yesterday, don't give a fuck today
And tomorrow I'm probably going to feel the same fucking way
They love you when I hit it, hate me when I miss it
So much yack in system you can smell it when I'm pissing
I smoke like a broke down engine, I love my money like I love my women
Let me show you how to whip it, let me show you how to pack it
Let me show you how to sell it, let me show you how to stack it
Pillow talking with these rest might get you excited
But don't let the pillow talk get you green lighted
Now I'm in the mix with the Mafia Six, but I breathe H-Town
I'mma die coalition, coalition
Told you once, told you a million motherfucking times
I'm like a shredder, don't get caught up in my fucking grind
Mix me with that shit, it's the wrong night
Body parts, hope it's them bitch niggas I don't like

[Verse 10: JGRXXN]
Monkey ass niggas sit banana clips (aye)
And water niggas 'bout to make me click (them)
Fucking with the Six catch a hot tip
I never go, never without my click
Ana for you niggas to the grizzle
And niggas think they superman, so you can get your issue
Six million ways to put them in the trunk
JGreen on the scene, put the body parts in dump

[Verse 11: Kokoe (DJ Paul)]
I’m the hardest Mexican, out of west L.A
Talk that shit your body end up in the fucking bay
All I listen to is Eazy and N.W.A
Now I'm riding with the Mafia, homie here to spray
Numb killers, drug dealers, cap-pealers
And hoes that never catch feelings
Cut the check, I cut your neck, put you in a body bag
Because your boy never ever ever have respect for a snitch
Nah bitch (Don't want it)
Nah bitch (Don't want it)
Nah, nah, nah, nah (Don't want it)
(Scale-A-Ton out the kitch', Scale-A-Ton out the kitch', you don't want nothing bitch)

[Verse 12: Lord Infamous]
It's the murder chains of massacre, [?] attacking ya
I'm nuking them like dracula, the bullets get on smacking ya
The ammo enter front then it coming out the back of ya
I gotta get your goon, skin his brain while I'm stabbing ya
[?]
Put on the gas and light up'll make your ass combust
I am Lord Infamous, I do not take prisoners
Mission to enter you, decrease your temperature
Serial killer, wicked voodoo minister
Scorpion sometimes Dr. Kevorkian
Shoot you in the porcelain, and give me [?]
Ghetto went corporate, Illuminati ornament

[Verse 13: Gangsta Boo]
All these fake ass hoes in my face, we ain't cool
But back with the Six, now I'm getting the bitches [?]
Unexpected gather, bitches shaking
We would like you shot your own self in the basement
Rule up in Memphis, so I'm kinda crazy
I don't give a fuck about what they saying
Hashtag that shit, put them at the real Boo
Mighty Mississippi [?] coast got killers

[Verse 14: DJ Paul]
Yeah, the Chump is here
I'm about to come out swinging
[?] from me, what was they thinking?
What the fuck [?] niggas be drinking
I'm too deep in the game [?]
[?] you out of sequence
I put your head on a secret, I make you start bleeding
I leave your ass stinking without me even fucking blinking
I'm harder than hard, don't fuck with the god
I come from a part where niggas don't starve, where niggas they in
Don't give a fuck about friends, them niggas hit in
I leave them leaking, and that there is a bad end
My gun don't give a fuck about illegal when I pull the trigger
It don't care if you even a fucking nigga
This pussy shit is unacceptable, don't test my testicles
I'm pointing [?], and leaving you niggas vegetables
With being Francis Jackson is the only way I got two faces
Had them sharp bullets going up and taking two faces
Niggas got my name on their tongue like they shoe laces
I lace you niggas with revolver bullets and leave no traces
Leave them up [?], mouth full of civil well
Put the price on your head, now my goons are millionaire
[?]
I don't give a fuck about care, so I never care
I'm a millionaire so the traphouse like [?]
Nah I'm lying, I still celebrate
A gun from the hip, so I still sell a bitch
Run around in a row with my nose in that shit, trick
With hella guns, big guns, you really want some?
I'm not sane, I'm insane, my guns go rappa-bam-bam
And I bum on these bitches [?]
Where the fuck I'm coming from [?]
Bitch!

[Hook 8x - [DJ Paul]) *plays in the background*
Get high to this shit - I'm high as a mothafucka

[DJ Paul]
Alotta rappers rap gangsta shit but they ain't did nothing
DJ Paul - Lord Inf'...Crunchy Blac fa real bussen
We done rolled down on niggas, we done let them gats burst
We done seen niggas blood leak clean through they shirt
I ain't lying too ya boys when I said that cha'll get did
Man I keep me some hungry niggas ready ta split the wig
Of a fake solid nigga, hoes lying in they raps
Cuz they never shot guns and they never had ta scrap

[Juicy J]
He wore a vest so we shot him in the neck
Made his body cold left em' red and wet
Body curved up like a cornrow
Police on the set, I'm a vet from the North - North
Pack a rusty tec in the Lex' plus a sawed-off
Hard makin' money when you watching for the ro-bbe-rers
Narcotics and these hoodrats - nut go-ba-lers
They'd take a shot at 'cha, put you in tha hospita'
Leave you left fa dead, and they tell ya I'mma halla at ya

[Crunchy Black]
Here I go again, try'na keep my mothafuckin' ass thin
Niggas halla friends, but they fake friends
I'mma nigga halla "mothafuck friends"
Tone up in my mothafuckin' right hand
I'mma 'bouta go and fuckin' rob a man
Just so I can keep my fuckin' family fed
Fuck what'cha heard this is what I said
Bust out some shots at ya fuckin' head

[La Chat]
I'mma meet you pockin' bitches, whoppin' niggas wit' my pistol
In my yard they discovered, dead I'm out here out makin' missles
This is war when you fuckin' wit' LaChat - bitch y'ain't know
Get 'cho posee out becuz we comin' 20 deep ho
Didn't you need ta know that all that talk can get you fucked up
Ho this ain't no game - that you playing you get bucked up
I'ont give a fuck who you is, who you in too
You won't touch a bitch, ha who me bitch - but I'll kill you

[Frayser Boy]
A crooked as a barrell of snakes
Fuck with the real not fake
I represent the Bay - so ain't no need ta hate
I'm counting tones and spray
I'll blow your clean away
This HCP don't play - won't see anotha day
Y'kno we Hyp-notize, can see it in your eyes
This Frayser Boy - no lie
Inhalin' dro - so fine
Y'kno we toppin' a poun'
And still we stompin' your smile
No need ta copy our styles
What chain't been popped in a while

[Lil' Wyte]
No more fuckin' around by now I'm fed up
I see your face has a frown - gatta keep your head up
Cuz when you fuck wit' this camp - let's say you messed up
They told you in the beginning - don't try ta test us
The day Lil' Wyte hooked up with the 6 - the shit was all she wrote
Y'kno these lyrics be burnin' - blisters deep in my throat
This shit be hotter than lava laying a hault in yo saga
Adding some Pippen ta bitches get at me weaker than water
This is the start of a problem thats lackin' a solution
You graduated with honors - ta sell out institution
And this for all the rappers that got kicked up out this camp
I stole your plate when back fa seconds - +How U Luvin' That?+
This is my mothafuckin' posee song - Wheres Jerome?
Instead of gettin' up out yo shit - you stayed ya ass at home
Potential lurking fa certain - I know you feel it hurt
If they knew bitchin' came wit' ya - you coulda kept ya verse
Bitch doubt me now

[Hook 8x - [DJ Paul])[Hook 1: Lil' Wyte]
Well I been trippin' for 10 hours on 3 hits of liquid microdot (I'm on acid - acid)
Gettin' chased around the car by some midgets in the parking lot (I'm on acid - acid)
Feedin' doritos through a tree, a million spiders after me (I'm on acid - acid)
I'm runnin' around havin' a fit, on myself I'm about ta shit (I'm on acid - acid)

[Lil' Wyte]
Can you imagine feelin' all calm then all of the sudden your fingers get numb?
Knees start freezin, what is the season?
Where we at? and why we leavin?
Trees are shrinkin', turnin' plants ta roots and roots back inta seeds
And clowns are changin', comin' at me, different directions now I'm freakin'
Ho's are rakin', body shakin'
Mane, I thought it was some crack
Called the fire department, told 'em I had a flame upon my back
This shit's crazy, plus enable, raisans dancing on the table
There's the horse, we got a horse, yeah we do and I seen the stable
Quit yo flaugin, I ain't flaugin
Got a beat in who ya talkin to
I'm talkin to you talkin to me
Listenin' cuz I have you and I have to
Be kinda smart to even catch that
I might be trippin' but the pimpin' grippin' gatta spit that
With no expectancy I made a party from a rivalry
Accidently, kicked then tripped the beef when he had ran by me
Fuck police, we gon' sanish this trick too well as the
50 shot of purple microdot you will be gone a week

[Hook 2: Lil' Wyte]
20-20 vision blur and can't even feel the syrup (I'm on acid - acid)
I can smoke a pound of dro, drink myself unda the flo' (I'm on acid - acid)
Put the straw up ta your nose, take the blow straight ta your dome (I'm on acid - acid)
You passin' out in my front yard, throwin' up on Xanax bars (I'm on acid - acid)

[Lil' Wyte]
Well I wishin I was sober, feel the shit from head ta shoulders
This ain't even halfway over, it's the part I'm waitin ta show ya
Laughin' long time like hyenas, laughed a long time at vienas
In the can or out the can they still look like a can a penis
I'm the meanest, acid-takin, down-south-cracka on the mic
Change start crankin', gotcha thinkin', good trip gon' turn ta a fright
Bubble poppin, trails are watchin', foes done cross the fuckin' room
My dogs came in the den and made a mess and then thats for the broom
Now I'm 'Bouta hit the sack cuz I can't take this shit no more
Relax my mind, take a deep breath and let my head sink in pillow
Take a seven hour nap, wake up seven minutes later
This the greatest drug the seventies is ever fucking gave us
Yes it's major don't be playin' - when you drop it will hit ya
If it's gel caps or liquid - microdots yes I'm wit'cha
And I'm flippin' cross the Roll, visual contact lightning globe
The space ship I'm flying landed in the Bay - I have ta go

[Hook 3: Lil' Wyte]
By now, I'm weak in some pain and my body's feelin drained (I'm on acid - acid)
Comin' down upon my trip and my skin's abouta rip (I'm on acid - acid)
I'll prolly sleep till Thursday and it's only Sunday (I'm on acid - acid)
Wakin' up on that Thursday to have another Saturday (I'm on acid - acid)[Intro]
Yeah
Been wantin to get a drumma drumma beat

All you gotta do is tell the truth

[Jelly Roll]
Welcome to the dirty South

That white boy from the ville blew up from nuthin but word of mouth
I ain't got no single no potential for the radio
I just got the hood behind me on top of a crazy flow
I'll let that .380 go, better let your lady know
It's a drought and I got more white than the Slim Shady show
Hold on let me stop a second shoot back to the top a second
How the fuck you pop bud he ain't never drop a record
Yeah they say it's smooth is, the way that I moved it
Pull up in the new benz the color of a blue tint
Talkin about a blue tint really I need five cause
Just to ease my mind I need at least three at a time for real

[Hook]
Let me pop another pill
Cause it's the only thing that make my mind clear
Let me pop another pill
Cause it's the only thing that really make me chill

[Lil Wyte]
Take one of me add some liquor syrup and some dro
Get two xanax bar crush'em up and pour'em down my throat
Pick me up shake me twice and put me right back on the flo'
Give me a half an hour and I'll be higher than you would ever know
I'm too high fuck it no I'm not let's go and get some mo
I'm on my heath ledger shit was that too soon? Fuck you ho!
I'm the hypnotize minds joker always staying throwed
Now that Jelly's down with Wyte music we going to get the dough
I'm the cracker he's the jam now we bought to stack some cheese
Two of the hardest honkeys in the game and we rep Tennessee
We go'ing get it but for now let's pop some pills and get fried
After all do you have any idea how many times I've died?

[Hook]

[Jelly Roll]
See it's trouble Wyte beside me itching scratching from the codeine
Come on down to Cashville and everybody know me
Antioch to M-Town
Ask them boys I been down, I don't need a chopper
Just a good shot and about 10 rounds
Really fuck my image, ain't never been a gimmick
O.G. in my city like squeeky is to Memphis
Yeah the boys still tatted up pockets still fat as fuck
Team needs a home run they look at me like "batter up"
Lot of shits changed since I got with Wyte music
But now I'm stackin money like I'm motherfuckin jewish
Yeah jelly roll will do it, I'll wake up and get to it
And A game is still my motherfuckin movement bitch

[Hook][Hook]

Either way im gonna get high right now and that's how it should stay
As of right now 420 is the international smoker holiday
Hello my name is Lil Wyte and I got some shit you'll probably like

Soon as its trimmed cured and jarred we'll break it down roll it and toke it

Puff puff pass you know the rules homie

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse: 2]
Well im smoking on some shit that got me feeling quite amazing
OG white kush but i sprinkled in some sour grape an
This is not something you get and put up in the Hookah
Mini cigarillo do the job hit like bazooka
Something bout this week has got me on my Project Pat-a
Tripping with the munchies in the store candy I'm after
All i hear is laughter my homies on the other aisle
Eyes are tight red white and blue and all i can do is smile
Snap outta that flow lets head back to the yo so we can smoke
Cause i gotta lil something on my dome right now that really needs to be wrote
I'm high as a bats ass an don wanna lose this thought process that I'm in
Get me that paper an pen and hit the blunt once more
An i lost that thought again

[Hook](yee-haw)

[Lil' Wyte]
Lil' Wyte's the name - their ain't a day pass
That I ain't in trouble, this changes the game
And turns a summer sault to a double
They hatin' me now - I vapped out and they gon' feel my rumble
But it is all gravy - I'm running and ain't 'bouta stumble
Backoff a few years and you will find some crooked decisions
I managed them clear and did not let them break down my vision
That's all I don't need - somebody try'na stop what I'm givin'
But there's just too many hoes out there to give one bitch my pimpin'
I'm bringin' ya Memphis - I just joined the white rapper convention
Back in the day - I blazed my hay and dreamed about recognition
But I done made it, they hate it
I love it, becuz of DJ Paul and Juicy J - I got so far from above it
Pushin' and shovin' they don't know of that I'm posted on a regular
Good 'ole boy from around the way - might be small but don't test me brah
Question brah, listen brah, yes thats what I'm stressin' brah
Yes thats me in your hood, 2-doo' Cutlass - what I'm flexin' brah

[Chorus: Lil' Wyte]
Jus' the good 'ole boys - hangin' out gettin' high
Jus' the good 'ole boys - watchin' cops ridin' by
Jus' the good 'ole boys - sittin' round drinkin' beer
Jus' the good 'ole boys - we was the clique the haters feared
Jus' the good 'ole boys - never really wanted blow
Jus' the good 'ole boys - was overloaded on that dro
Jus' the good 'ole boys - 2 doo' Cutlass what we flexin'
Jus' the good 'ole boys - if you in the road you better move we comin' yo direction

[Lil' Wyte]
Don't let yo window catch a cloud - I'm as high as you
I know you wish this song would keep on bumpin' through a pound or .2
But it's all good - it's gonna go off - like everything that goes up comes down
I make sounds come out my mouf - then put now snawls to make 'em melt
Watch me guarantee the game - nothing but some fucking pain
Put cyanide in cyringes and inject it in they veins
Threw up on the league the hardest music Memphis seen in a while
Hit me quick wit' Triple 6 and then let out +Mystic Style+
I was hook and good 'ole boys like me was catching the vibe
I survive - I strive now look at me - I'm all in the sky
Keep in mind, I was the one overlooked alla the times
Deep inside, I thought that I was the one never would rise
Here I am, I'm spittin' it out and bringin' it too ya taday
Ain't no gangsta, just a Bay, area represento wit' something to say
So if you want me come get me - y'kno where I'm at
I'm prolly there right now, but there's no way good 'ole boy
Like me go out without my Crown now

[Chorus]

[Lil' Wyte]
It's like this, good 'ole boys - I don't get what they can out this game
Whether we are, down in our slums or we on top of this thang
Cuz I've got, some real ones rollin' with me down for the cause
Even if the, situation get sticky they ain't 'bouta pause
So I must, watch over my fleet and lead em all inta victory
Mystery how did I get here, all the rest is just history
Liberty is what I'm seekin' to get away from misery
Mess with me - you'll be fucked up
Cause I'll let out inner energy
Never was a problem child - always kept up with the game
The slang, and somehow everyone in the hood knew my name
It ain't my fault it made me, too be something that you ain't
It is my fault I'm doing, something that y'kno you can't
Man I remember gettin' drunk, drinkin' my self unda the flo'
Reminiscin' of throwing up - makin' love to the camode
I did my dirt, didn't I get caught and still serf' birds in the end
But that's all right cuz All I need's my little girl and my pen

[Chorus][Hook 1: Lil' Wyte]
Well I been trippin' for 10 hours on 3 hits of liquid microdot (I'm on acid - acid)
Gettin' chased around the car by some midgets in the parking lot (I'm on acid - acid)
Feedin' doritos through a tree, a million spiders after me (I'm on acid - acid)
I'm runnin' around havin' a fit, on myself I'm about ta shit (I'm on acid - acid)

[Lil' Wyte]
Can you imagine feelin' all calm then all of the sudden your fingers get numb?
Knees start freezin, what is the season?
Where we at? and why we leavin?
Trees are shrinkin', turnin' plants ta roots and roots back inta seeds
And clowns are changin', comin' at me, different directions now I'm freakin'
Ho's are rakin', body shakin'
Mane, I thought it was some crack
Called the fire department, told 'em I had a flame upon my back
This shit's crazy, plus enable, raisans dancing on the table
There's the horse, we got a horse, yeah we do and I seen the stable
Quit yo flaugin, I ain't flaugin
Got a beat in who ya talkin to
I'm talkin to you talkin to me
Listenin' cuz I have you and I have to
Be kinda smart to even catch that
I might be trippin' but the pimpin' grippin' gatta spit that
With no expectancy I made a party from a rivalry
Accidently, kicked then tripped the beef when he had ran by me
Fuck police, we gon' sanish this trick too well as the
50 shot of purple microdot you will be gone a week

[Hook 2: Lil' Wyte]
20-20 vision blur and can't even feel the syrup (I'm on acid - acid)
I can smoke a pound of dro, drink myself unda the flo' (I'm on acid - acid)
Put the straw up ta your nose, take the blow straight ta your dome (I'm on acid - acid)
You passin' out in my front yard, throwin' up on Xanax bars (I'm on acid - acid)

[Lil' Wyte]
Well I wishin I was sober, feel the shit from head ta shoulders
This ain't even halfway over, it's the part I'm waitin ta show ya
Laughin' long time like hyenas, laughed a long time at vienas
In the can or out the can they still look like a can a penis
I'm the meanest, acid-takin, down-south-cracka on the mic
Change start crankin', gotcha thinkin', good trip gon' turn ta a fright
Bubble poppin, trails are watchin', foes done cross the fuckin' room
My dogs came in the den and made a mess and then thats for the broom
Now I'm 'Bouta hit the sack cuz I can't take this shit no more
Relax my mind, take a deep breath and let my head sink in pillow
Take a seven hour nap, wake up seven minutes later
This the greatest drug the seventies is ever fucking gave us
Yes it's major don't be playin' - when you drop it will hit ya
If it's gel caps or liquid - microdots yes I'm wit'cha
And I'm flippin' cross the Roll, visual contact lightning globe
The space ship I'm flying landed in the Bay - I have ta go

[Hook 3: Lil' Wyte]
By now, I'm weak in some pain and my body's feelin drained (I'm on acid - acid)
Comin' down upon my trip and my skin's abouta rip (I'm on acid - acid)
I'll prolly sleep till Thursday and it's only Sunday (I'm on acid - acid)
Wakin' up on that Thursday to have another Saturday (I'm on acid - acid)Bay area, bay area... (repeat till frayser boy starts)

[Frayser Boy]
Allow me to introduce myself two tenty one seventy six
Busted out my mama's womb, the haters havin a fit
The birth of a frayser boy is now on the fuckin scene
Raised in the Brier ain't too many things I ain't seen
Bay is in my blood, I came up around them real niggas
Niggas on the run, got feds watchin and takin pictures
Hooked up wit them thugs thats hypnotizin yo' minds
Good lookin out paul and juicy, now I'm back on this grind
Ain't no stoppin this time, because the sky is the limit
And I'mma stay loyal to my dawgs, till the day that I finish
You know this race I'mma win it and much love to the bay
And all them niggas I fucked wit then, I fuck wit today
So this yo' dawg comin at ya, so haters dont ya start
If you wit me you can catch me robbin frayser boulevard
Gone on that bay, dont you play, this is where I'm gonna stay
Found my home H.C.P. no longer a fuckin stray, dont play

Bay area, ain't love fo, fuck you hoes we down till we die(repeat x8)

[Lil' Wyte]
This the verse they gonna show you right off the wamb I throw them thumbs
H.c.p. w-y-t-e frayser B bay we be droppin bombs
Watch-the-fuck-out, here we come(pop! pop! pop!)ya'll can't get none
All of a sudden this long haired green eyed faggot tryin to get him some
Let me let ya in on a little bittty secret I could lyrically toast ya
Plus I'm from the bay that explains my reactions like a vulture
Quickly find ya, sniff ya out, now matter how far you mite be
Strong aroma, pass is over, all the air the bay I breath
That got me places, call me crazy, somehow I done fuckin made it
So mo' in my verse weak then you did it 3 months I know you hate it
Watch me rise up to the top because my hood has put me here
Sometimes I feel some parts of the bay got its own atmosphere
Haters, hustlas, rappers, real-ass-niggas, rednecks, and fuckin queers
Chokin doja, watchin po'po's ride by while they throw a beer
Yeah its kind of hectic in my neck of the woods but respect it
Life is so damn gravy in the bay for me you had to check it(BIITCH!)

(hook, with scratches, frayser boy giving shoutouts to the Bay)[DJ Paul - repeat 8X]
Fuck what you, who gives a fuck what you bitches say

[Lil' Wyte]
I'm putting this one down for tha Bay you can bet bitch
Commin to tha Bay, round my way I'm a vet bitch
Launchin lightning by tha pound
Call me mister coke and crown
In the town I'm found we got tha sound to make them haters frown
Break it down
Now B is beating niggas about
Y is yours now figga it out
Constantly questioning all tha bickerin ghetto fab is what I'm bout
Got me commin up on hustling
Pen pad I have to preach
Fuck what you say if you disagree me run in tha streets
I'm always commin wit sum mo'
Probly fuckin on yo ho
If you car got took I'm tha one who threw tha brick through tha window
Repercussions, guts are gushin head gets busted for practically nuttin
Consequences they fold up, its splatter close will be discussed
And Frayser's where my roots were sold and so that's where I call my home
If it wasn't for tha Bay, tha rap game I would not belong
Hear this song man who gives a FUCK what you bitches say
Don't get wrong, when you get got just blame it on da Bay

[Hook]
If your ho get fuck (You can blame it on da Bay)
If your car get took (You can blame it on da Bay)
If your boys get shot (You can blame it on da Bay)
Someone run up in your spot (You can blame it on da Bay)
If your clique get hit (You can blame it on da Bay)
Robbed blind fo sum shit (You can blame it on da Bay)
Beat down in these streets (You can blame it on da Bay)
Get jacked fo sum green (You can blame it on da Bay)

[Verse 2]
Blame it on da Bay is what they all say when something happens round they way
Either they too scared or too wrong to bring to our face
Add it up - took his ho, stole his car, and shot his bro
By now someone like me should be dead but ya know
I'm tha one superstar out tha hood, its all good
Cause tha hood that I plug is tha Bay understood?
Rock 'em, sock 'em leave 'em for dead but keep up in yo sight
Tightly lock up 'em off in tha dungeon wit out a crack of light
Frayser B-O-U-N-D must be all up inside of me
M-E-M-P-H-I-S crunkest city in Tennessee
Blame it on da Bay if there's a glitch up in your atmosphere
Hear tha sound of money being made and its so crystal clear
Haters watch tha street strapped wit heat that I'm feelin fine
Gradually I peak over tha steep hills that I have climbed
And when I get finished with this path that I'm bout to pave
Please know that I wouldn't be shit wit out tha fuckin Bay

[Hook]

Koopsta too hard, my god, body parts, body parts

[Verse 3: Skinny Pimp]
Chrome 40 mag, when you got 'em stuck

[Verse 4: Lil Wyte]
And I got that thang changed, I hope you ready for what has begun
Dumped all this body parts in my trunk, and I did that there just for fun
Mom told me a long time ago "The respect will come", and it's finally here

Get blessed like you done sneezed or some shit
I'm starting a new religion and The Scarecrow will be my beacon bitch

[Verse 5: Crunchy Black]

All a nigga came for was motherfucking bread
Mafia Six in this motherfucking bitch

[Verse 6: La Chat]
La Chat bitch, I'm wrecking shit

Crestwood is my hood, and I rep it all day
I'm the madest desert eagle till the twos wanna play

[Verse 7: Project Pat]
Pat'aahh
Chopper on the floor, work on the stove
Loud to my lips, smoke out my nose

You get fucked up little pussy with my fingers on this hand
Cut the grass like a lawnmower, like a rake
Faught you niggas like Django, quick as a snake

Duffel bag full of motherfucking dead white meat
Told your bitch pussy [?]

[Verse 8: Locodunit]

You fuck with my high, you're not going to roll right
Breaking two gold bottles, hang with the real
Chill with the real rockers, killers and pill poppers
We cuffing that shit and them niggas that steal choppers
Fuck you feel about this? Real lane
Scale-A-Ton tatted from my arm, drawn in my palms
Kush inbetween my index and my thumb, exhale from my lungs
Load the Tommy Gun, split the tongues, kill them one by one
Dump all the body parts into my trunk

[Verse 9: Point Blank]
Didn't give a fuck about yesterday, don't give a fuck today
And tomorrow I'm probably going to feel the same fucking way
They love you when I hit it, hate me when I miss it
So much yack in system you can smell it when I'm pissing
I smoke like a broke down engine, I love my money like I love my women
Let me show you how to whip it, let me show you how to pack it
Let me show you how to sell it, let me show you how to stack it
Pillow talking with these rest might get you excited
But don't let the pillow talk get you green lighted
Now I'm in the mix with the Mafia Six, but I breathe H-Town
I'mma die coalition, coalition
Told you once, told you a million motherfucking times
I'm like a shredder, don't get caught up in my fucking grind
Mix me with that shit, it's the wrong night
Body parts, hope it's them bitch niggas I don't like

[Verse 10: JGRXXN]
Monkey ass niggas sit banana clips (aye)
And water niggas 'bout to make me click (them)
Fucking with the Six catch a hot tip
I never go, never without my click
Ana for you niggas to the grizzle
And niggas think they superman, so you can get your issue
Six million ways to put them in the trunk
JGreen on the scene, put the body parts in dump

[Verse 11: Kokoe (DJ Paul)]
I’m the hardest Mexican, out of west L.A
Talk that shit your body end up in the fucking bay
All I listen to is Eazy and N.W.A
Now I'm riding with the Mafia, homie here to spray
Numb killers, drug dealers, cap-pealers
And hoes that never catch feelings
Cut the check, I cut your neck, put you in a body bag
Because your boy never ever ever have respect for a snitch
Nah bitch (Don't want it)
Nah bitch (Don't want it)
Nah, nah, nah, nah (Don't want it)
(Scale-A-Ton out the kitch', Scale-A-Ton out the kitch', you don't want nothing bitch)

[Verse 12: Lord Infamous]

The ammo enter front then it coming out the back of ya
I gotta get your goon, skin his brain while I'm stabbing ya
[?]
Put on the gas and light up'll make your ass combust
I am Lord Infamous, I do not take prisoners
Mission to enter you, decrease your temperature
Serial killer, wicked voodoo minister
Scorpion sometimes Dr. Kevorkian
Shoot you in the porcelain, and give me [?]
Ghetto went corporate, Illuminati ornament

[Verse 13: Gangsta Boo]
All these fake ass hoes in my face, we ain't cool
But back with the Six, now I'm getting the bitches [?]
Unexpected gather, bitches shaking
We would like you shot your own self in the basement
Rule up in Memphis, so I'm kinda crazy

Hashtag that shit, put them at the real Boo
Mighty Mississippi [?] coast got killers

[Verse 14: DJ Paul]
Yeah, the Chump is here
I'm about to come out swinging

I put your head on a secret, I make you start bleeding
I leave your ass stinking without me even fucking blinking
I'm harder than hard, don't fuck with the god
I come from a part where niggas don't starve, where niggas they in
Don't give a fuck about friends, them niggas hit in
I leave them leaking, and that there is a bad end
My gun don't give a fuck about illegal when I pull the trigger
It don't care if you even a fucking nigga
This pussy shit is unacceptable, don't test my testicles
I'm pointing [?], and leaving you niggas vegetables
With being Francis Jackson is the only way I got two faces
Had them sharp bullets going up and taking two faces
Niggas got my name on their tongue like they shoe laces
I lace you niggas with revolver bullets and leave no traces
Leave them up [?], mouth full of civil well
Put the price on your head, now my goons are millionaire
[?]
I don't give a fuck about care, so I never care
I'm a millionaire so the traphouse like [?]
Nah I'm lying, I still celebrate
A gun from the hip, so I still sell a bitch
Run around in a row with my nose in that shit, trick
With hella guns, big guns, you really want some?
I'm not sane, I'm insane, my guns go rappa-bam-bam
And I bum on these bitches [?]
Where the fuck I'm coming from [?]
Bitch!

Fuck you motherfuckers
I'm out of here
I'm going to the bar[Hook: repeat 4X]
Drop it off drop it off
Bitch I got a sawed off
Put that money in the bag
Ho I'll blow yo ass off

[Verse One]
It all started out cool and calm, we had it under control
We had blueprints to the bank from roof to floor
My nigga Paul had them yawks and bullet-proof vests
Juicy dropped off the 600 the get away the best
We had an in-sider that was working for Union Planners
She told us everyday at 6 o clock they turn off the cameras
At 6 o five the guards go on break for milk and banannas
Six thirty guards come back from break and back on with the cameras
So that gives us twenty five minutes to get in and out
We gotta do this shit so quick and slick without a doubt
I got some folks that be down to ride all it takes a shout
And if its business they comin quicker thats what they bout
God as my witness we gonna get this one some way some how
With thirty million dollars in diamonds we can't miss out
The plans in action tomorrow we gon case it out
Give me twenty four more hours and we gon clean it out

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
It's going down five o'clock and we loadin the trucks up
Get the 40's get the vests get the masks get the pump
Dont forget the smoke bombs to cloud them out when we get done
Man this shits about to get so hecked up under the sun
Six o clock pullin up and we know surveillance off
Six o five guards are breaking and were waiting on the cough
Thats the sign to come in and lay everyone on the ground
Units in faces of customers so they dont make a sound
Keep your guns up and your masks on till the cash gone
Now lets get this thirty million in diamonds and mash on
8 minutes left on the clock before the cameras click
Back into rotation on the bank and they scope out the shit
Got the jewerly got the loot, situations looking cool
All of a sudden a cop comes outta no where and he start to shoot
So many rounds is wizzin by me I dont see how I ain't dead
Smooth? stepped in the way with a AK and shot the cop in his head

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
We got the diamonds in the stash spot, and 10 in he tank
But the police on our tail an officer down in the bank
So we hit the gas threw the masks, lost the vests and ditched the gats
Made a corner, hit it fast, man these folks all on our ass
Push the 600 to the limit, we doin a dance
Fraiser hit the brakes goin 150 tryin to make em crash
Trippin in the back seat cause im high up off that mary jane
Talkin crazy, its over this time and it ain't funny man
Ballin down Lamar dodgin cars and we ain't tryin to stop
My Rolley onion came off of a side street and smacked a cop
But they still comin, its seven of em, and they catchin quick
After Sunroof I through a smoke bomb and they got lost in it
Make a left a right a quick left, pullin to this driveway
Turn your tail lights off and just park and dont go no where just stay
Pokey off our trail hot as hell but we still gotta shoot
Back to headquarters to come forward seperatin the loot[Hook: Juicy J]
I'm gettin' fucked up, man I'm gettin' fucked up
I'm gettin' fucked up, man I'm gettin' fucked up
I'm gettin' fucked up, man I'm gettin' fucked up
I'm gettin' fucked up, man I'm gettin' fucked up
A player drinking Maker's Marker, cranberry Vodka
Maker's Marker cranberry Vodka

[Verse 1: Lil Whyte]
Give me a cup some ice some vodka and let's go
Give me some dro let me put down the Crown and Coke
I'm slummed out drunk as fuck and I know
You won't make it home if you ride with me bro
Cause I've been drinking since 2 start to smoke around noon
With no sleep I'm feeling similar to a cartoon
Animated but gonna manage to make it through the day
Bein' a rapper's close to being an alcoholic that gets paid
I done see the higher ground now that I'm on a different plane
If you step to me wrong I'm a have to show you I'm the man
I'm Lil Wyte the motherfucking drunk n cracker sippin the blue top
As long as I'm here I'll rip it so long that you'll never let the blue stop

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Wyte]
Well I'm fucked up! by now you should see
Maker's Marker and some Vodka flowing all through me
On the way to the liquor store to get another bottle
Runnin' red lights never taking my foot up off the throttle
I'm a little tipsy, cock-eyed the whole nine, 40 proof or better
And I really don't fuck with wine I'm a whisky sipper
Sour Mash is not the slime, I got motherfuckers
That get drunk and fight for fun, get up out my way
You see ma brain is on a different level
Break tequila out and you gonna see me
Turn into the devil, I'm the one and only Lil Wyte
I do it my way Bitch! A guy that gets fucked up
With me then hit the highway Bitch! And that's what's up

[Hook][Hook: Lil' Wyte]

[Hook]

[Lil' Wyte]
Now put this in yo mind, keep it close behind
All the fatal memorys you've been counting in yo head for time
I Like to get high I get drunk and I might let it slide
Catch me on a zanax different atmosphere, its do or die
Walkin in the club fucked up, mission to take yo bitch
Hopin you gonna speak of one word, when I approach yo bitch
Tracy don't suck dick but I bet I can deepthroat the bitch
Jus fuckin wit ya, got my own, I really don't want yo bitch
Nothin but mumblin, and I'm stumbling, but ima keep on the bumpin
And I bet this gotcha Caprice Classic trunk a fuckin' rumblin'
Fuckin' wit' me getcha trampled Lemon Lame is an example
He got beat down by these dogs, and all he got was just a sample
But now I'm on my way to better things
No more runnin about the cove wit' the Glock cocked, and slangin mary jane
I got a well focused head and well educated brain
And plus my vision see clearer than x-ray glasses main
So fuck you mean?

[Hook]

[Lil' Wyte]
Last time I'm tellin' ya lyrically beat ya
Standin ovation, I'm comin to seat ya
I would drive the full 40 hours to California to defeat ya
Creature-feature but I ain't scared, rippin' out a patch of hair
Tryin to convince me that you crazy, verbally this isn't fair
Ask me if I fuckin care, shut the fuck up breathe the air
Didn't ask you to open yo mouth, don't make me come over there
Platinum products get dropped daily up out this facility
Ill drop my shit on ya thinking everywhere ya feelin me
Watch me come up out the grave and capture yo security
Beat ya down like you stole something man that's for fuckin' wit' me
Make ya shit yo pants so bad that you can plead insanity
Have you strapped in a straight jacket yackin bout yo family
Really cause and effect is what gets us in these crooked binds
Plus the lack of respect or neglect towards these simple minds
Keep the system tickin? itchin? For corruption on the rise
I'm getting tired of sittin here, and you can see it in my eyes

[Hook]Watsup Bitch, Watsup Ho
Watsup Bitch, Watsup Ho
Watsup Bitch, Watsup Ho

If you riding with someone you know and they turn up this song
You riding with a motherfucker that think I did 'em wrong. (x2)

[Verse 1]
Consequences come to those who chose to fuck with lil wyte
Not always physical sometimes mental and emotional right
I'll outsmart you in a fight and come back harder on the mic
Theres an inner spiritual demon that possess me to write
Now that I made all these moves
My music causing some havoc
This shit is pick me up so wat in the fuck did you expect god dammit?
As long as the beat keep on rollin, my pockets gonna get swollen
I know they hate me, they let me know the first time that I told 'em
I got a mind and it's focused
You got some serious issues
I got family friends, and fans and you ain't got no one to miss you
I bet you'll life gettin hard
You lived your life in a yard
Im for real I know theres something when you sold both of your cars
You mad at me cause I made it, I'm only havin some fun
See me on mtv yelling out who gives a fuck where you from

[Hook] - 2X

[DJ Paul]
Yeah it's time to speed on up, we finna go into another motherfucker

When I see you, I'm knockin yo head up off of your shoulders
You gon be like ah shit when you feel
These tiny boulders

The HCP cracker main, slap you man, stab you man
Even quick to crack your brain

Keep on passin by cause I got something
You'll never fuckin find
This the realest of the real
Hope you feelin it and if you dont
Extend your arm and grab your remote
And turn down your radio
Meanwhile, I'm gon give it raw
And write it as nasty as this shit can be
Its easy when you rappin over the hardest motherfuckin beats
I am not braggin, and I'm not big headed, nor am I conceded
But I'm proud of myself and the way I supposedly succeeded
You wanna bring it to my door
Or be a bitch and catch me slippin
Either way it goes this unit I'm grippin's gonna get you, pimpin

[Hook] - 2X[Intro]

[Hook: Lil Wyte](x2)

Bitch I do this on some liquor, ho I do this on some weed
Bitch I do this on my downers, ho I do this on my speed
Bitch I do this for my fans, ho I do this for my team
And if I'm living in my dreams, I guess I do it in my sleep

[Verse 1: Lil Wyte]
My train of thoughts might slow down at times that I get restless
Sometimes I don't wanna write raps, and I question
What the fuck am I doing in this game? Is there a lesson?
Or am I just making a livin', preachin' as I'm stressin'
I've met about a million of my fans; shook hands
And every one of them in their own way, has told me I'm the man
So I take that in consideration whenever I am writing
Let em' know that I'm two times stronger than 10 million bolts of lightning;
Striking the competition like the iron when I am scorching hot
I can do this shit super high on pills and weed, and drunk or not
Whenever I dropped Doubt Me Now, I was the first to talk about some pills
Now everybody getting their roll on and have leveled out the playing field

[Hook: Lil Wyte](x2)

[Verse 2: Lil Wyte]
Now that I've been around the block a time or two
I've come to show 5d, but there's a million in my crew
Most of my clique consists of goons who can't afford the internet
So 75,000 likes on Facebook ain't talkin' about shit
I've got a squad in every city that we visit
*And Wyte Music ryders is what they're calling our business*
You fuck with me; or any other of my equal rankie's
Watch your back everywhere you go cause you still gon' end up stankin'
Man they crazy; Wild as a motherfucker
They smoke weed, drink liquor, pop rolls, and all the bad bitches are some bloodsuckers
They come from up under the gutter, and the roughest places you can be
And my favorite part every fuckin' one of em is they're just like me

[Hook: Lil Wyte](x4)

[Outro][Lil' Wyte]
Know what I'm sayin
This mothafucking song dedicated
To them weak ass bitches that follow me in the club
On that weed, that white, that liquor, the whole xanax bars
That X whatever the fuck they on
You know what I'm sayin?
They think cause they drunk and they crunk
And they got a unit in the trunk that they just some hard mothafuckers
You know what I'm sayin?
But really they's the weak bitches
You know what I'm sayin?
You fall up in V.I.P. (HCP) thats the real killas sittin in the back
Waitin on yo mothafuckin ass, you know what I'm sayin?
Bitch

[Lil' Wyte]
Smoke a blunt, get drunk, hit a line of that funk
Now you fallin up in the spot and you thinkin that you crunk
You ain't crunk, yous a punk, and I'mma show you that tonight
All it takes is one killer to step and we can start a fight
In the middle of the club, bitch wasup we can do this shit
Security ain't gonna jump in the way because they scared of this
Implantin this into ya brain so you know the next time you cross the line
Again it's standin full of sin when you fuck wit the boss
Biggest, badest, roughest motha fucker, but ya still a bitch
I'm comin in crunker than the others for the fuck of it
Liquor bottles hit ya harder than some syrup when ya slum
Have ya shakin, fakin, body achin by the time I'm done
Legally this isn't right but ask me if I give a shit
Peacefully I'll read your rights and have you beggin me to quit
Hit ya weed and liquor or whatever else it takes to jump
Just remember, just cause you fucked up it doesn't mean your crunk

[Hook: repeat 2X]
I know you strapped, but you cowards like to play hard
And knowin that you don't wanna catch a murder charge
See butsters like to get full of that weed and liquor snort a line
In ya mind now yous a killer

[Lil' Wyte]
Damn man goddamn paul man you might have to slow this motha fucker down a
Little bit man I'm on that syrup man I'm high and I'm drunk man you need to slow down

[Lil' Wyte]
I'm not scared of you just cause you came in actin a damn fool
Runnin lip talkin shit, bet you wouldn't without ya tool
Now ya hard very hard ballin down the boulevard, pissy pants doin ya dance
I'm behind ya in a faster car, weak as water so is yo mama, father and ya
Faculty, quickly solder up yo lips so you can't trip or speak of me
Watch me creep up from the back wit gats and pick you off by ones
Had to repaint the walls wit ya while ya smokin on ya blunt
Hate to be the one to show you that drugs kill and that's a fact
But I love that I am the one who put the bullet in your back
Next time when you step to the plate come back and just let it rip
Stead of bitchin out I thought you crunk, you ran back to ya whip
Holy ghost is up in ya when you see me you fade away
Makin fun of all you cowards powered by a pack of bay
Hopefully one day you'll find out in the end you just a bitch
Until then just keep on drinkin smokin snortin up some shit

[Hook] - repeat to fade[Chorus - x 2 ]
In the street I'm bout my buisness how I be a be a

Don't pass wit no brains if no thangs blow some big ass checks
Straight to the liquor store thats were we roll to get my 75

Worked that whole week to get that cheese and give that shit to me
Bet you feelin shitty fall to sleep on the side of the street
Tell me how it feels walkin round I no whats goin on
Only thing you no is I'm the 1 supplyin all the stone
Keep my pockets swoll and I be ballin on the fuckin slab
Think you droppin sissions in my buisness take yo buisness back

[Chorus - x 2]
In the street I'm bout my buisness how I be a be a
If you want some work from me you pay a fee a fee a
When I check my crackhouse I'm gonna reup reup

[Verse 2]
Well I ain't waistin mine, gotta get them nickels and dimes all the time
Cuz Benjimin Franklin the only mother fucker on my mind

And I know the junkies see me colors changin all the time
When you spot me better stop me cuz I'm not slayin long
The pigs love comin up to this white boy ridin on all this fuckin chrome
Got yo stone bitch I'm gone destination where I stay
Fraiser boy up on the side and bitch were ridin to the bay
What you talkin bout? what you askin bout? what you need from me
Check it I serve some big bags, some crack, and some ecstasy
Anything else I don't fuck wit it, or I just fuckin know
Were to find it where to get it and how far the shit will flow
Where smokers and sellers these drugs be so plentiful
But junkies will do anything for that crack mane and its pitiful
They loose there life Critical they loose there bodies shut down physical
But rock it up you get yo grip and all that there is beuitifull

[Chorus - x 2]
In the street I'm bout my buisness how I be a be a
If you want some work from me you pay a fee a fee a
When I check my crackhouse I'm gonna reup reup

[Verse 3]

Or I could take a chance flippin this bird to a bro
But see its jus my luck po's will prolly kick in my doe
So I gotta keep lookin over my should lookin out for dem hoes
And I gotta find another location plus anohter temptation there so
Many faces and customers in this occupatin and I have no patience
And people wanna fuck wit my time thas why you be comin up short wit these

This evil is wit it wit no discussin this is how I spit it

[Chorus - x 2]
In the street I'm bout my buisness how I be a be a

[Verse Two - Lil' Wyte]
Check it out I'm new on the scene, Lil' Wyte lighted with gasoline
Fire breathin' gettin' closer to the grass that isn't green
Which means your team is piled over in the back
Sixteen bars on the side and knowledge on every track
Holdin' it down, never happenin', gettin' my crown, keep on rappin'
And even at 75 I'mma still be able to work my magic
Beater, I'm pacin in front of the next new generation
Rising legacy shinin' the cross of soberbination
Need a passport and luggage and a new wardrobe
Fifty billion but I will settle for 2.4
Check the scans I'm the man in this independent land
No video or no single countin' g's like I be damned
This white cat can rap and put on a good show
It's funny how this music can put me down to the flo'
I got to give it raw I got to give it dirty
What ever city you reppin' beat 'em down if you heard me

Security started movin' to the middle of the crowd
Only if he got a gun I agree to shut it down

Pick me up let me out blow me up and bump me loud
Too many styles be coming up out of me that when I break I hit the crowd
I have a high page game face eye balls poppin' out

It's 4:20 roll up
It's 4:20 smoke up
It's 4:20 fire up
It's 4:20 toke up

[Verse: 1]
It's 4:20 I'm either in Michigan Cali or Denver with my dog's
Or in a illegal state in the USA just breaking the fucking law
Either way im gonna get high right now and that's how it should stay
As of right now 420 is the international smoker holiday
Hello my name is Lil Wyte and I got some shit you'll probably like
Its coming straight from Stoner town and guaranteed to get you high
And i put my stamp on it like OG white kush i'm granting my mind
Rolled up whatever the fuck you want we'll blow it down till we are blind
Yeah we do this all the time if i can grow it im gonna smoke it
Soon as its trimmed cured and jarred we'll break it down roll it and toke it
I been on this mic for a while and you better believe when im speakin i ain't jokin
It's that loud and its 420
Puff puff pass you know the rules homie

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Grab your weed get your lighter lets get higher fire up
Fire Marshall tryin ta shut us down but we ain't high enough
I don smoked on plenty weed but this shit here is kinda rough
OG white kush is the hybrid that is my supplier of

[Hook]

[Verse: 2]
Well im smoking on some shit that got me feeling quite amazing
OG white kush but i sprinkled in some sour grape an
This is not something you get and put up in the Hookah
Mini cigarillo do the job hit like bazooka
Something bout this week has got me on my Project Pat-a
Tripping with the munchies in the store candy I'm after
All i hear is laughter my homies on the other aisle
Eyes are tight red white and blue and all i can do is smile
Snap outta that flow lets head back to the yo so we can smoke
Cause i gotta lil something on my dome right now that really needs to be wrote
I'm high as a bats ass an don wanna lose this thought process that I'm in
Get me that paper an pen and hit the blunt once more
An i lost that thought again

[Hook]Due Talk
Sitting on the corner smoking marijuana age 12
Never thought I'd have a picture off inside the XXL
Started free styling 16 in the cafeteria
Wrote a hot 16 than all them then knew
I was serious White Boy Dinero introduced me to the Shelby Forest Click
I ended up getting on 10 of they 15 songs the shit was sick
My dad put up them cheese for us to get them press
Man I swear to god they thought we was the motherfucking best
Who knew a year later 3 6 would get a copy of it
And I'd came out with a solo deal yelling Mafia, bitch
They felt like I traded on em I was following dreams
Had a baby on the way and couldn't afford diaper, rash, and cream
So what do you think I did when I got to my crossroads
Kept on walking straight never looked back once and went with my whole soul
Though it came with the consequences, conflict interrupted
Every time we saw each other we was fighting over nothing
One day they sent a junkie to my home to do me harm
I was outta town so they commenced a beating up my mom
She had brain damage after the first blow to the head
Had to spend a couple of weeks in the hospital bed
Her condition got worse and started stressing out my dad
4 years later into all the pills he had a massive heart attack
The Dr. said he'd be ok, but you know how them things go
Now I live my life without either one of my fucking folks
Because my mother's mind is gone, she don't recognize my face
And my dad, yeah hes passed away he's in a better place
But I blame myself if I would have never signed that contract
Maybe shit would be different and I would have both of my parents back
But neither one of them wanted that, they wanted me to shine
They know I was exceptional with an extraordinary mind
So I say Thank You, to my gift and my curse
The fact they won't see the SNO album drop is what really hurts
So all the people that were involved in causing me this pain
Understand you poured gasoline in the center of my flame
And I'll keep burning till the end of time you'll never put me out
If that was your attempt to shut me up you need to choose another route
Now I'm colder than ever I got the whole world going crazy
Why you still only getting 20 people in the Daisy
I'm the man, bitch you shoulda stuck along for the ride
Wyte Music is on the rise and now my bodies full of pride
MotherfuckaMan, I'm messed up [echoing] the hell [echoing] what kind of pill was that
[Echoing] GOD [echoing] man it sound like I hear someone screaming [echoing]
What the fuck [echoing] man I'm sooo fucked up, God I promise let me live
Tonite [echoing] man I will never get high again

[Lil Wyte]
I'm slummed out right now, that ain't no suprize
Dilated pupils seein doubles out of both my eyes
I hit up a little spark, got 'em for no charge, and fuck with his boy
Xanax bars call 'em totem poles or even tonka toys
I popped half and then popped the other half and hit the crown
Then put my shot glass down and poured another round
I'm starting to feel everything I just put into my body
Liquor and the bars got me right though I might look retarded
Get up out my way little quicka with the K
Even though I'm fucked up I'mma still maintain
Got sumthin in my brain like do damn thang
Like tell the same mayne's ass soft insane
I'mma monsta when I'm high specially on some bars
Don't need to cop lyrically can catch a charge
Runnin down the street yellin fuck the police
With Reeboxs on my feet high on 4 more bars
I'mma hold my crown and I'mma rep my Memphis pop my pills, smoke all my deeros
Be fucked up fall out in public fallin out on crackers and negros
Ho you think you know Lil Wyte I'm telling you rightcha now
You hold out I'mma find out better pull 'em out and pass them sticks around

[Hook]
Totem poles, Candy bars, even Yellow ladders
Tonka toys, White sticks it don't really matter
If you got 'em pass that shit around I want to look like you
If you got 'em pass that shit around I want to look like you
Totem poles, Candy bars, even Yellow ladders
Tonka toys, White sticks it don't really matter
If you got 'em pass that shit around I want to look like you
If you got 'em pass that shit around I want to look like you

[Lil Wyte]
One little pill you can break down into fo's
Guaranteed when mixed with liquor it gone have on the flo'
Take advantage of the power the sticks put off every hour
Try to over do it you gone find yourself off in the shower
This is not some powder the effects are completely differant
You are not a coward if you pop one and get scared of the shit
You might forget what you did the night before if you want 'em
Better get somebody to be witcha only if they ass is sober
Gotta keep my fuckin brain on chicken lane change only if the beat bang
I'll be able to do my thang no what I got to do know why I gotta rock
Fucked up or not I'mma take this shit to the top
If you see me in the streets betta believe me this cracker is off the hezzy
Memphis, Tennessee is my stopping ground and zanex bars just went down in me
This weed in me and Henessey all over my academics T
Was fucked up and don't remember shit but fallin up out the S-U-V
They serious don't play with 'em if you can't handle 'em come my way
We'll rock 'em to the BAY and we'll deal 'em up on the slang
When I bump my female in an all night bang with a BIOTCH!

[Hook][Hook]
I get drunk and I pop pills
I can show you, but I can’t tell you how it feels
This a complicated life, the one that I live
I don’t give a shit bitch, it is what it is
I’m on my own shit, own shit, lost in my zone shit
Own shit, own shit, lost in my zone shit
I’m on my own shit, own shit, lost in my zone shit
Lost in my zone shit, lost in my zone shit

Two crazy baby mamas, two daughters, too little time
It’s hard for me to address my true feelings in the rhyme
I try and try and just keep coming up with empty lines
Billions of thoughts creep around the outer edges of my mind
And I’m intelligent but use alcohol and drugs as a crutch
For some reason when I’m high and drunk, I don’t feel the pain that much
So I just put some more OG in another blunt
Bottle up my problems and keep my eyes faced to the front
Head in the sky, always high, never looking down
And if I don’t plan to land, then I don’t never have to see the ground
Captain of the plane and all the bullshit, fuels the tank
And right before we boarded, we cleaned out all of the Memphis banks
Money train or money jet, we gonna get that money bet
Don’t anyone know what we doing, look at all the phonies sweat
Can’t tell you where I’m going, I'm at, or even were I was
If something goes wrong tonight, then I’ll just say it was because

[Hook]

I got a career that held on somehow for now well over a decade
And still get shows every weekend with no fucking radio play
I guess I’m ahead of my time, or even walking the perfect line
But I still can’t get no sleep, cause my hours are fucked from driving and flying
That’s part of the game, I know that so I deal with it
Crack the crown open I wash it down and take some pills with it
That’s the only way I’m getting rest in Memphis ten
Call me what you wanna call me, but you don’t know where I have been
I’ve seen my homies die, watched my child get took in court
Plus my pops is dead, I no longer have that father support
You think it’s easy being me? I got as many problems as you
And that was a few that bothers me, keyword: 'was a few'
Listen I've walked, rode bikes and drove up this road
And I’m gonna keep it 150 miles per hour on this ho
Tires are never gonna blow
Engines never gon' explode
I’m W-Y-T-E I don’t care what you think of me
And just so you know

[Hook x2](Hook: Lil Wyte)

M.E.M.P.H.I.S I've held it down I run this town
M.E.M.P.H.I.S Thumbs up till I hit the ground
M.E.M.P.H.I.S my city is cold blooded homie
M.E.M.P.H.I.S watch your own homies, homie (2X)

(Verse 1: Lil Wyte)

Yeah Yeah

Welcome to Memphis, Tennessee I am the white man that runs this ho
If I could give you a tourist tip I hope you brought a gun in this ho
Not a too much money though a little bit of dough
Don't ride too clean don't put on no show
If you got a bad bitch better leave her at home
Cause a Memphen gonna take what it wants
If that means your car, or even your wife
Better watch A&E these first 48 boys will take your life first 48 boys will take your life
Maybe its something in the water that makes us lose our marbles
Then we hit Bill Street, Wet Willie's and loose em even farther
We got no sense but stack dollars uneducated we get brain from scholars
I was lucky and I had my father grew up in Fraiser and wasn't bothered
You know what my fucking name is I ain't saying in this rap
I'm the only motherfucking white boy in the city to even stand up and speak of it
And put it on the damn map its true

(Hook)

(Verse 2: Miscellaneous)

Yeah

They say my city filled with young dropouts
Ridin around with they Glocks out
That tough shit get your ass knocked out
Glock in your mouth watch your whole brain pop out
From the side of town where they banging, nigga
Mob shit where they claiming, nigga
AKs what they aiming, nigga
Even bitches got nuts and they hanging, nigga
From the side of town where they known to hate
But that known hate only motivate my whole city made first 48

Fuck backwards don't even look over your shoulder when you walking
Keep your eyes on the money at all times it don't matter if your mind is talking
Listen I've got a master plan and it involves a lot of money
Best part is its safe in my brain
And no you cannot take that from me betcha
Really want to know what it is huh
But you really don't know how to ask
Secret Society Money Train Gang members know things that can't be passed
Partee got on the media faculty media demanded we should huddle
He asked "Wyte what it do whats the move damn fool"
I said sit down and shut up

(Hook)[Lil Wyte]

[DJ Paul]

Take your shirt off and commence to whippin' hoes

Roll with them punches motherfucker don't run
Swing back (swing back!), pop back (pop back!)
Clear the room motherfucker like click click (boom!)

(Hook 4X)

[Josey Scott]
Here I come, an only son
I'm goin' straight out the ghetto to number one
I'm gettin' higher, I'm on fire!
So all you haters better get ready to retire
I'm on the scene, I keep it mean
I went from having no chedder to bling bling
I got some ice, I'm never nice
And I'm a killer so don't make me say it twice
Straight out of Memphis, can I get a witness?
And I be lookin for the chickens with the thickness
I'm here forever, any kind of weather
You say you don't take advice you fuckin' better
My anger swellin', my hate it dwellin'
I might be naughty or nice there ain't no tellin'
My mind trash, I'm about to blast
Not even a hero can save your fuckin' ass!

(Hook2X)

[Lil Wyte]
See the Lil Wyte, I'm from the bay
I do not play, you best of prayed
This is my time, I'm 'bout to blind
I'm smokin' pine, I am so high
I'm 'bout to ride, best not collide
'Cuz if I see you I'm creepin' up from behind
You better hide, you on my side
You in my hood and I know I'm up in your mind
I'll break it down, just like a pound
Of some of the prettiest gally that you done found
I am the man, you are a lame
I'll fuck you up worst than the effect of a plane
This is the real, don't like the feel?
Then get back off in the kitchen where you can chill
I roll with killers, and drug dealers
And all the others I kick it with 'bout their scriller
Throw 'em in the mosh pit!

(Chris Steve talking)
Yo this is Chris Steve from Saliva comin' at you
