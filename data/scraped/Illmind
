[Intro]
Love yourz
Love yourz
No such thing

[Hook]
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

[Verse 1]
Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive
Fake niggas mad, snakes
Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrived
Don't be sleeping on your level cause it's beauty in the struggle nigga
Goes for all y'all
It's beauty in the struggle nigga
(Let me explain)
It's beauty in the struggle, ugliness in the success
Hear my words or listen to my signal of distress
I grew up in the city and though some times we had less
Compared to some of my niggas down the block man we were blessed
And life can't be no fairytale, no once upon a time
But I be God damned if a nigga don't be tryin'
So tell me mama please why you be drinking all the time?
Does all the pain he brought you still linger in your mind?
Cause pain still lingers on mine
On the road to riches listen this is what you'll find
The good news is nigga you came a long way
The bad news is nigga you went the wrong way
Think being broke was better

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
For what's money without happiness?
Or hard times without the people you love
Though I'm not sure what's 'bout to happen next
I asked for strength from the Lord up above
Cause I've been strong so far
But I can feel my grip loosening
Quick, do something before you lose it for good
Get it back and use it for good
And touch the people how you did like before
I'm tired of living with demons cause they always inviting more
Think being broke was better
Now I don't mean that phrase with no disrespect
To all my niggas out there living in debt
Cashing minimal checks
Turn on the TV see a nigga Rolex
And fantasize about a life with no stress
I mean this shit sincerely
And that's a nigga who was once in your shoes
Living with nothin' to lose
I hope one day you hear me
Always gon' be a bigger house somewhere, but nigga feel me
Long as the people in that motherfucker love you dearly
Always gon' be a whip that's better than the the one you got
Always gon' be some clothes that's fresher than the ones you rock
Always gon' be a bitch that's badder out there on the tours
But you ain't never gon' be happy till you love yours

[Hook]
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

[Outro]
Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive
Fake niggas mad, snakes
Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrive[Verse 1]
Having conversations with mama, man, my life is a mess
Ain't been returning the texts, so she been reading the press
She got Google Alerts, them shits go straight to her phone
She worry 'bout me from home, you know she raised me alone
She said, "I heard you back with you know who
I told her, "girl, I'm always back with you know who"
And she like, "who are we kidding? You're 27, you just being you
You're your father's child, man, thank God you got some me in you"
At least I always, at least I always see it through
At least I'm always being true to what you taught me
Retired teacher, but your words still got me evolving
Never get sloppy drunk, but alcohol is problem solving
And look I hate it when you hate on all my girlfriends
And assistants always convinced that there's someone better
Like that girl from your gym who trains you
I know you wanna arrange it, you told me she's free Thursday
And I'm sure that she's an angel, but she don't want this life
The timing ain't right
Maybe one day, but even one day with us is a time of her life
We do things that people pay to document
You got the sweetest heart
But I'm not here to give out compliments
Or boost nobody confidence, momma
I got no friends in this, momma
I don't pretend with this, momma
I'on joke with this, momma
I pull the knife out my back and cut they throat with it, momma
I'm Game of Thrones with it, momma
I'm Home Alone with it, momma
I'm t-
I really hate using this tone with you, momma
I really hate getting aggressive on this phone with you, momma
I really hate wasting your time to check a clone or two, momma
It's just they cloning me, momma
Them niggas wannabes, momma
Its like - I'm the one they wanna be, momma
I just- I- I can't be out here being vulnerable, momma
I mean I kill 'em every time they do a song with me, momma
I sing a hook they sing along with me ,momma
What more they want  from me, momma?
Yeah, this is a crazy life
But you and the six raised me right
"Don't ever take advice," that was great advice
You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life

[Verse 2]
Having conversations with momma, we start talkin' bout dad
You know he dropping a single, he saying this is his window
That nigga still wearing linen, that nigga still in the club
Call him after we get off the phone and show him some love
That nigga Memphis for real, girl, he love you to death
He made mistakes throughout his life that he still doesn't accept
But he just want our forgiveness, and fuck it, look how we living
I'm content with this story, who are we not to forgive him?
At least I been to a prison, at least I know what it's like
I used to rap on the phone with one of his friends doing life
And now I got me a Grammy, that could be part of the reason
Let's just call this shit even, we got some things to believe in
Do you remember back to Weston Road, Scarlett Road?
Hangin' with Aaron Bell and Reny
Shit could've gone south for me, he looked out for me, ma
He never let me do drugs
He let me shoot a gun one summer, but out there everyone does
He made me listen to his music, old music, soul music
Shit that can only be created if you go through it
I used to get teased for being black
And now I'm here and I'm not black enough
Cause I'm not acting tough
Or making stories up 'bout where I'm actually from
But I just roll with it, momma, rolling stone with it, momma
Gotta be careful around Rolling Stone
Or anyone that's tryna throw stones at me, momma
I'm not condoning it, momma
They will not tear nothing down, I built this home for you, momma
Know I don't call enough, momma
I just been working with so little time for personal, momma
Hard labor let me pay the price
You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life[Produced by !llmind, co-produced by Kanye West, Travi$ Scott, and Jeff Bhasker]

[Intro: D'Banj]
Stuttering
Giving 'em rest and making love again
In my best, I be the run again
And I have the man dem stuttering

[Hook: D'banj]
I'm getting this nigga in the morning
He gon' think he been chiefing, just too long when
He see me in the evening, wanna catch all these feelings
Well, let me be the first to get mine, ohh

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Barbeque and blow in the back of the crib
Sitting and counting, smoking a spliff, this shit's a gift
All my niggas watches is rough, grabbing our crotches
Yelling what up? The jeans cost $500? Fuck
Stop it, keep baking, see, the smell it's a statement
One freeze of this shit, you won't feel your legs kid
I'm a gangsta corporate hustla, my voice is illustrious
Hounded by vicious dons, nigga we armed, trust me bruh
They yelling Chef, kill the plate with the cooks
I say 'Ye with 2 Chainz on, we Common, let's Push
Burn another bush, then burn another we brothers
Love us or not, the Mark Zuckerbergs of the block
Hug a knot, staying rich, we was built for the guap
Park the green six deuce on the deuce just props
Rock a kilt, mean Glock, I'm all machinery, ock
Cling to me, now see how the scenery rock?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Common]
I was born by a lake, chicken shack, and a church
That mean the flow got wings and it come from the dirt
Godly, I know she wanna test the 'Rari
Eye on a dollar like Illuminati
Life is foggy, tryna see through the mist of it
Could have been living it, you was Mrs. Mischievous
This is just a letter to better your development
Situation delicate

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Some claim God body, blame Illuminati
All cause his pockets now knotty as his hair, yeah
All Sonny, no Cher, only solitaires
You clusterfucks could cluster up
On tippy-toe and still not muster up
So it's (ashes to ashes, dust to dust)
In God we trust, the game is all us
'til the sky calls or it's flames on us, Push

[Hook]

[Verse 4: 2 Chainz]
2 Chainz!
I'm chilling in my camo, flipping through the channel
On my GOOD Music shit, my logo's a Lambo
Four doors of ammo, ammunition I'm pitching
To make your body switch another position

[Verse 5: CyHi Da Prince]
I hope the people is listening, I could never sell my soul
I gave it back to God at my christening
It's tickeling when I hear what haters be whispering
What makes you think an Illuminati would ever let some niggas in?
Fake friends and siblings
Like to wish you well but ain't never flip the nickel in
Haters wanna pull they pistol when they see me in this race car
But you can't spell war without an A-R
15, I was pushing carts at K-Mart
By 21, they said I'd be inside a graveyard
Can't wait to get that black American Express
So I can show them white folks how to really pull the race card

[Break: Kid Cudi & (Kanye West)]
Yeah, you feeling on top now, getting that money nigga?
(You sold your soul)
Yeah, you feeling on top now, getting that money nigga?
(You sold your soul)
Yeah, you feeling on top now, getting that money nigga?
(Naw man, mad people was fronting
Aw man, made something from nothing)

[Outro: Kanye West]
I treat the label like money from my shows
GOOD woulda been God except I added more O's
If I knew she was cheating and still bought her more clothes
It's cause I was too busy with my Baltimore, you know
Some people call that the art of war, you know
I guess it depends what you falling for, the clothes?
Cars, money, girls and the clothes
Aw money, you sold your soul
Nah man, mad people was fronting
Goddamn, we made something from nothing[Intro]
I don't mean to be greedy, or steal your moment, but sometimes I just got to rap circles around motherfuckers
It's Hoodie baby!

[Verse 1]
Ok, I don't really mean to be superficial
Don't want to talk about the women and money I got
Getting beautiful women is not the issue
Cause the women only coming when the money is hot
I'd rather be living my dream than be living a lie
Homie everywhere you be going you be killing the vibe
It's like you walk in the room and the people get quiet
We ain't talking bout you, we just want to be private
My shit fly like a personal jet, I'm earning respect
From every single person I met
You always looking in the mirror, you should learn to reflect
You're old news, all we rap about is current events
So if you started having doubts bout your relevance
Change your name to my name for the hell of it
So you can reap the benefits of being fucking jealous
I'm the only one in the damn room like an elephant
*elephant noise*
(Haha everyone else is quiet
You understand? Let's go)
Tell me I'm fire, I'm better than that
Say I'm a liar, I never been that
Homie keep trying
You wallet is on a permanent diet, it's never been fat
That shit is science
My shit apply to every motherfucker out there who try
You should retire
Blame it on Tommy and cry to your mommy you never been fly
Rappers pretending it's all black and white
But I ain't got time for that clean shit
Oh you'd rather be James Dean I would rather be me bitch
(I'm just being honest
You don't usually wear those big ass glasses
The internet's forever
Deep breath)

[Verse 2]
I'm talking this and that, this and that
Identical twins, homie that's a sister act
You like riff and raff but that's piss and trash
I'm at the top of the game like aristocrats
Got a vision and I'm gonna finish it
Watch all these haters go beg for their innocence
You talking shit there will be no forgiveness
Writing in permanent ink on the internet
Swallow your words never assume
People keep talking cause that's what they do
As long as they talking bout me and not talking bout you
Let's let the talking resume
Let's just assume you jealous of me though
No necesito amigos I'm all on my own like a free throw
Bout to make white girl money with burritos
(Shouts to chipotle, shouts to chipotle)

[Verse 3]
Shit's so hot that you got to rewind it
New York City's finest on the diamond
I'm Nolan Ryan when I wind up
You strike out and I'm making hits without even trying
There's no denying, I'm making noise like a siren
Every hungry motherfucker want a little piece
Fall back homie when I kill it on the beat
Got a shorty in the west and wifey in the east
Bitches just visit me after my shows
All of their clothes go invisibly, just like a cloak
Homie you're talking that wizardry
Best rapper out there, I mean that shit literally
(Let me finish)
You got Costco raps I'm a commodity
These people buy my songs, wear my clothes
Come to shows, go online and follow me
(That's first team bitch)[Produced by Illmind, Jeff Bhasker, Kanye West, & Travis Scott]

[Hook: D'Banj]
Im getting this nigga in the morning
He gon' think he been chiefing, just too long when
He see me in the evening, wanna catch all these feelings
Well let me be the first to get mine, Ohh!

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Okay I’m chillin’ in my camo, flippin’ through the channel
On my GOOD Music shit, my logo’s a Lambo
Four doors of ammo, ammunition I’m pitching
To make your body switch another position
And listen, my weed loud, fuck her and speed off
Tell 'em I bare arms, I'm cuttin my sleeves off
Lettin' my tats show and I sag my pants
Im letting my ass show, I'm hot as tabasco
I study, Castro, yeah, my plug from Cuba
Inside of the car is like a damn computer
Inside of the crib is like a damn museum
You ain't seen these before, you better get 'em on film
Tryin to take these fat pockets, man your chances are slim
Disrespect, you stomp em out, man give em a Tim
You ain't did what I did, see I know I'mma win
And they dont have slow-motion so I did it again
Woah!

[Hook: D'Banj]

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Okay I'm sittin' on the plane, flying over graves
I am so high, nigga I can talk to rain
My outfit's insane, ain't that evident?
My chain had another chain like it was pregnant
My favorite dish is turkey lasagna
Even my pajamas designer
She got a fat ass I make her rewind
Back seat so big I press recline
Got a dirty sprite in my cup holder
Rappers like road kill, they get run over
They get done over, it's just one solider
This flow will make you fall like its October
Me and your girl, nigga opposite of sober
Celine Paris chain charm look like a cobra
Young Casanova, Baby Romeo
I got my girl geeked, she look like she from Tokyo

[Hook: D'Banj][Produced by !llmind]

[Intro: Big Trigger]
Yea Ya'll know what it is
Rap City presents Em360
Slaughterhouse, Eminem, Big Tigg, Just Blaze!
On the 1s and 2s, oh-oh

[Intro: Eminem]
Yo Tigg, get in the not booth
And spit the truth, to the young youth

[Verse 1: Big Trigger]
Aight, ay, Amex don't leave home without your cards
But this Hip Hop, so don't leave home without your bars
And for some of these rap stars, that's just too bad
Cause you can't bring out them bars, that you ain't never had
It's Eminem and Slaughterhouse, yeah you know we the truth
And ohh the game is out of order, since we closed the booth
Yes indeed original, beats the replacement cause
The back room will never be what the basement was

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
I'm the realest mo'fucker that I know
Wasn't always the case guess the figure had to grow
I do it for the love I don't do it for the dough
But I know these sucker figures will so they keep me on my toes
What's sad is I couldn't tell you what I'm hated for
And them painkillers didn't murder the pain they gave me more
These fans on my head now they say they want the old Joe
I grew up mature y'all can't see that this the old Joe
Want to see me lose every battle of depression
No matter what it do to me, no matter my regression
They want to see me fall, want to ruin my regiment from the start
Want to cut the beat off soon as I let em in my heart
I'd be the first to admit it, lost focus for a while
Sendin' unsolicited dick pics to dimwitted thick chicks
Was so high I lost track of my ways
Then I fell in love with a baby and got mad at her age
The way she act and behave, was it an act or a phase
How you trife when I gave you life
You was lacking in wage
You don't want say hi or speak to me
Bet you makin 200 dollars by weekly
Try to help the world out, bring some reparation
And forget being humble in a state of desperation
Ain't gotta ask what to help with no hesitation
And for me to deal with it I might need some meditation
I love you but its best we stay apart, segregation
And to cope with the feeling I might need some medication
Trust me I don't never want to see that side of Joe
It would kill us all slow, one reason I'm the realest mother-mother I know

[Verse 3: Royce da 5'9]
Its Nickle, riding round in that Maserati four seat
Symbol on the grill looking like Tony Stark's goatee
Best rapper alive and you know me
The most distinguished shooter that's coming up out of the D since Joe D
I take mines at lead point
At the risk of having to shave my garlic clove in a razor inside a fed joint
Hip hop is alive, but the rhymes died
Only fear I have is "world star" being yelled from my blind side
Don't get me wrong it ain't like I ain't never lost a fight
But these days I'm more like a lyrical artiste
I'm outlining everybody in chalk white
The off-beat deceased version of Dr. Narcisse
This ain't blueprint, your idolizing
You tryna jump fast that's foolish of you in my drunk past and handing me my pilot's license
That's plain stupid, your boy's a star
Sitting in that drop top fish bowl and the doors ajar
It's ironic I remember when I couldn't afford a car
And now it's back and forth
The black one or white one I call 'em Macklemore
And Lord Jamar, first we defyin' the odds
We not a group, we more like a circular firing squad
This not a booth, this is our house and we won't stop
We killed the cypher two times already
What you gon' give us an award
But we won't stop for shutting down the internet
Now tell ya momma hi, and tell Rihanna we ain't finished yet

[Verse 4: Joell Ortiz]
When we step in that booth, that's when the flame enters
Best spit, make any set trip, yeah its the gang members
Waving that shady flag, navy jag
Matching the yank' fit, with the polo brief showing, due to the lazy sag
I'm in a crazy kind of place
I got this thing right on my waist that'll leave tears on your baby mommas face
So chill, I'm in a crazy kind of place, I got this thing below my waist
That'll leave kids on your baby mommas face, for real
The flow gets cracked, as it came in capsules
Your cap just started snapping
My starter caps was snapping
When cross color was cracking
And my cane was half full
With the half moon park, hope you rap dudes smart
Don't piss me off like the bathroom mop
You don't want it with me
If I'm throwing hooks at you, that don't mean the chorus for free
So save your jabs its way better
If I start throwing jabs I'm talking Zabs first three round against Mayweather
Yeah I'm a crook from the brook, that mastered how (?) shook turned notebook
Broke cook, I'm so dope look
Bring the beat back with no hook just bars
Just a thing of ours that make their pants drop, make em open up their bras
Move g-strings like guitars, that's nothing, that's something light
Like Riesling at the bar
Y-A-O-W-A, if y'all ain't saying Yaowa by now you got nothing to say
This like NWO vs NWA, y'all like the rockers versus the ROC
Full of nothing but Jays
Check the rocks its nothing fugaz'
But don't get stupid my Cooper clique will throw shots for a couple of days
Make it horny when we out, Amityville horror, y'all don't want it with the house

[Verse 5: Crooked I]
Slaughter season, y'all the reason
Real dudes I'm bringing some more in
Like a Polynesian
Sick with the llama squeezing
Bullets flew and the chopper sneezing
Got your body and legs torn, but before you was airborne
You was bob and weaving still getting hit till your nos' is weezing
They set you deep in your coffin sleeping
I'm gone off the deep end, I'm a wolf, this industry my sheep skin
I'm out here hunting with my ink pen
I'm living like a kingpin
Doing it for my g's in the pen
Dreaming about two-piecing a police chief's chin
You rappers something candy coated, I don't like suckers
I'm Iron Mike, I don't like Busters
You looking for em' fly dudes like Orville and Wilbur
You got the Wright brothers
No bright jeans, no bright colors
I'm the second coming, the one that Pac predicted
Islamic, Gnostic and Christian, the flow so godly you got to listen
I backed you in a dodge a minute
Like MC Eiht in a L.A. hat, these rappers straight tryna dodge a menace
I'm looking at your videos, look like your watching tennis
Brothers dressed like Maria Sharapova wearing yoga pants
Meanwhile Big Poppa was rocking linens
I guess that era's over man, hold on
I'm splitting atoms when the scientific spitting is getting at em'
I give em' different patterns, they didn't fathom, they stealing my styles
Before me you didn't have em'
You rappers made in my image like when God was inventing Adam
Stab em in the abdomen when its crunch time
I truly flip like Mayweather pissed of at a movie script
Too many punchlines
Family I'm amongst mine
I keep the peace like a monks mind
.357 fade your favorite barber
Leave you in an old bush like an unshaven Barbara
Don't stop what we doing
When you see L.A. your team will be ruined
This game need a new villain, I'm the kind to murder you on vine, ooh kill em'

[Introduction: Big Trigger]
Ladies and gentlemen
Now introducing the man, the myth, the legend
Mister Marshall Mathers AKA (chicka-chicka) Slim Shady

[Verse 6: Eminem]
Ayo can we cut this beat off
I might need to do this acapella, yo
Role model?
I'll roll a model down a hill over broke bottles of coke products
If she don't swallow, and thump her till the bumper, hit the throttle
While I'm tryna hit the pot holes, I'll freaking take Madonna to McDonalds
Any bitch'll end up horizontal gettin' fondle
I don't cuddle, I don't coddle
Only motto that I follows any thing I drive, whether its a  Navajo or a Tahoe
Its got a ho in it
Nah ho, I don't got no freaking bronco
You looking for a buck, get a horse, fuck Tonto
I got a rusty Hondo with a bondo
And a box of condoms you little blond ho
Fuck me? fuck you too, like I'm at Bonnaroo booing Bono
And I ain't from this planet so nanu, nana, nanu
I'm intolerable, too volatile, screw it I don't got too make honor roll
To be on a roll
I don't know much, what I do know I do it pronto though
So knock it off, all these knock off me's,
The last thing the world needs is another me
But if you think this is part 2 to Recovery
Or Love The Way You Lie part twelve
Or something heart felt, you bout to make a discovery
Like you found Christopher Columbus' compass
Ain't dumbing shit down for you dumb fuckers, so suck it
I took your best punchline like a punch in the stomach
That punctured a lung punk and I'm still functioning from it
Chump it was nothing
Now watch while I fuckin' one up it and toot my own horn
Once I think of something to trump it
And I don't need a fucking instrument to sound off
Like the trunk of an elephant. The triumphant
Return of the ether spitting retard, reborn
But chances of you having another re-birth, slim to none
Like a skinny Mother Teresa, give a fuck if its Easter, so kiss my keister
Cus that's the only thing I'll turn the other cheek for[Produced by !llmind]

[Verse 1]
Fuck your opinion
I don't need your approval baby
You should keep it pushing now
Just a swing and miss you ain't pullin' shit
And I really can't believe the audacity
Don't you play with me
Damn, fuck you think I am, careful what you sayin
Cuz you gone regret the day you ran that slick mouth right
(I'm right)

[Hook]
You talkin' bout some shit you never get to do
Tryna get me on some stuntin shit, I'll stunt on you
Trynna get me on some stuntin shit, I'll stunt on you, (stunt on you)
Stunt on you
I ain't that bitch
(An enigma,  I'm not like them)
And just when you getting kinda comfortable
I-I-I switch it up
Just when they think they know me I switch up
And when they finally onto me I switch it up
Switch it up switch up, switch up, switch it up

[Verse 2]
Not like the rest, don't fit the mold
I stay on the low, straight scheming
Girl save your breath ain't down to roll
Ya ain't even on my level, stay dreaming

[Hook](x3)[Verse 1: H Da Kid]
Now what you know about a young black man
Who try to make it out this land
Cause my city ain't popping
And babies having babies ain't fucking stopping, any moment
You had your dreams and you let it drop
And now you depend on the city to give you guap
Cause you couldn't make it solo to the fucking top
Instead you screamed out YOLO
And that's when your dreams stopped
And all you lost in this world was your baby mama
14 years old and you already got mad drama
Damn, how can that be?
Society is so fucked up I hope it don't affect me
Cause I'm trying to make it out and do my city proud
Seen a lot of friends that fell for the drug crowd
And now we don't even speak
I'm still tying to go out and shine like that nigga Meek
Every fucking week
Chasing my dreams, trying to make a scene, my past is dirty, but my future looking fucking clean

[Outro]
And that's the truth, lets pray for the youth, having babies when we should having dreams to the roof[x2][Verse 1: Jay Diem]
It’s possible I was birthed in a mental hospital
To lead the church of hip-hop say hello to your new apostle
New arrival I’m nuking rivals
Polluting cyphers
Dreaded menace I’m like the homicidal Mekhi Phifer
A pied piper a rough rider the best writer
Loney Toons rooming with his goons
The most despised Kaiser
King among men spitting crack until his lip blow
Pistol Pete on tracks for Pete’s sake he’s got a pistol
Don’t move
No shoes
Obvious he’s piss poor
Got a little cash spent it on time and crisp flows
And some Ritalin
Swallow while he riddling the little men who twiddle
Thinking they can match his pillagin’
Move up your men and I’ll break em’ down by the barrack
Burry em’ by the bayou and burn up all of their merits
Lyricists trying to line up their bars just because of Kendrick
I’ll hop on top of your track take your bucket hat and then kick it
Kick up dust in your lenses
Dust you off like forensics and finish you
Tell your manager that your career is finished
I’m Eminem and you Cannabis
Man to man with us
I’ll press you down where you stand corrupt
And damage all of your stamina
[Verse 2: Jay Diem]
Pick pocketed Pac’s rhymes out his pocket
So all these hip hop tops lips lock
Whenever I plop these winter flows I had since Kid Rock rocked a flat top
Doing rap-rock in hi tops till his strings popped
Dilapidate any mixtape like an M-80
You just an M-8 forgetting lyrics like you Wayne Brady
The kid crazy like Gnarls and Charles Barkley
Not a role model but I still lead like I’m Paul McCartney
Hardly barking like these no bite niggas you see on TV
It’d take a team of their leaders to even pee on my EP
Secrete the feces on tracks and then cruise through the city streaking
From a window seat just so all of the little kids can see me
Hollow lobotomist
Bottle swallowing arsonist
Artisan pauper who’ll put a molotov where your mama is
Hope you inside of the house while you tear and cough
Claw you in the face and sanitize it with some Smirnoff
I don’t smoke crack dumb nigga I sell it
Forget a born sinner Im a new born felon
No disrespect to J
I just feel a little rebellious to labels selling us cages
Im raising hell in a cellar
Oh it’s so unfamiliar they hate the way that Im ripping
These turn up vegetable rappers until they come up missing
The point you missing is that I’m so young and just getting better
Im burning up like I’m running on the track
In 97 sweaters[Produced by !llmind]

[Hook]
He gonna give you all his love
He gonna give you all his time
He won't let a minute go by
Without the thought of you crossing his mind
I be like fuck a bitch, I'm trying to stay rich
I'm trying to concentrate on hoes
Even if I fuck that bitch do the freakiest shit
By the mornin, I got the go

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I got all kind of bitches, a vet bitch, a beginner bitch
My phone ringing and I ain't answering cause I'm in a bitch
I'm more like a pimp than a trick, I send a bitch
50's and lead escorts, call me the runner bitch
If we going out we going Dutch pay for your dinner bitch
Look bitch, this is my life I'm on some different shit
Every different day I wake up to play with a different bitch
Bitches love me, just like I love me
Fat bitch, skinny bitch, short bitch, tall bitch
You wanna buy me shit, meet me at the mall bitch
In the strip club, let her lick your ass bitch
Get the cash bitch and then go back to your man bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I got a ghetto bitch, a good bitch, a certified hood bitch
She with me to do the to the end, bitch fuck me and her friend
I said I'm headed to the top bitch I'm trying to get it all
A real bitch will be there for a nigga if he fall
The club pack front to the back up in this bitch
Got on my Louie checkers grey and black up in this bitch
Diamonds on my neck, diamonds, diamonds on my neck
Bitch niggas front if you want, we got swimmers on deck
Get your ass hit over a bitch
The bitch ain't shit she in a porno clip with a bitch
She can't suck dick but damn nigga use your head
She gonna find another dick to suck when you're dead

[Hook]

[Outro]
West side
This that shit right here!
Feel like it's supposed to be on that Detox!
Yeah
Niggas think they're better than me, but they're not!
Fuck that! I'm just gonna start over
So we gonna act like I ain't been that nigga for 8 years
And I'm a new nigga! Call me Ferrari! GGGGGG-UNNNIIIT![Verse 1]
It's yours, the likes of which that you had never seen
Do it how you knew it, the influence never leaves
Your inhibition is kicking while they shooting up a scene
Come and do it to your pocket while they do it to their sleeve
Said to do what you believe, well we believe in more amounts
More around, more to find, more top cop, more to count
On it now, borderline mortified, stalling out
Take a leap of faith and lead the way into a smaller town
Town business like you found business when you brought it down
Borderline til a 745's brought around
And you 'round it forever whether you know it or stay away
You mount up together knowing you throwing a stray away
Thrown in a position to be lifted from a day away
Drumming like your heart beat, numb to what the song be
Thrown in a position to be with it if you want piece
Whether you agreed you denied, doe or die

[Hook]
Cause you gonn ask Bodie for a package, believe that
And everything will be the way it should be on the feedback
Hands up over fists' when it's clicking, you see that?
Point out what you want and it's yours
Cause you gonn ask Bodie for a package, believe that
And everything will be the way it should be on the feedback
Hands up over fists' when it's clicking, you see that?
Point out what you want and it's yours

[Verse 2]
It's yours, the likes of which that you already knew 'bout
Decisiveness is everything in shoot outs
The ills of the wills when the chill don't exist
And the risks become more than the rewards that they threw out
Paint the town mint green, the intrigue stays at the front
Same story illustrated from the jump, you know the wagers that they want
But retro's is a weekly occurrence
And I'm in mine now so my deterrence, is flourished
In irony, like either make a poem or make a zone
Become a flight and do what you wish you could do and make it home
'til they teach you bout a throne and the leather that the seat on
Is from the same couch you got your feet on
Shit is more or less until the rest become a seance, you see on?
Grew up idolizing like "if Jay on, then we on"
Thrown in a position to be with it if you want piece
Whether you agreed you denied, doe or die

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Skarr Akbar]
It's yours, the product of the environment you've confided in
Pressure bends knees like the side effects of klonopins
You deep inside the sea of the streets, look for leviathans
The beast pray on the weak, no repeats and no try agains
Silence, talk less and do more
No time to ask "who is it?" when knockers knock at your door
Put yourself in a position to listen
Or be a victim
Or another bad static of a tale in Baltimore
When summer falls, we spring into the winter
Recruit 'em at front and center
Move product with new beginners
So the package that we lend ya
Out of respect for ya father
Jell it all and have the money by tomorrow
Just do it how they taught ya
And everything will work if you believe that
Be careful, and watch for the feedback, you see that?
Thrown in the position to be with it if you want piece
Whether you agreed or denied
Doe or die[Intro - Akrobatik - talking]
("In the cityyyy, well there")
Uh, yeah, yeah (yeah)
What up y'all?
Yeah
Back in effect
One, two, one two
Yep
Uh, let's do it
Yo, front row

Yeah, back row, what's up
What's my name y'all (yeah)
Akro

[Verse 1 - Akrobatik]
Just when they said it couldn't be done, I am back (uh)
Witness the reappearance of your radio interference (um)
I've been given clearance to smash the airwaves
Of these program directors and all of their slaves
I'm sendin 'em to their graves (uh)
My indie hustle got too much muscle for them to even try an' tussle
As we struggle through the jungle I'm pullin you out the rubble
I'm trouble with the lyricals, somethin like Je-sus with the miracles
I can't turn water into wine
But I can drop a hard rhyme that's slaughterin' your spine (huh)
Calm under pressure like Tom Brady, 4th and 10, runnin short of time (huh)
My skills are borderline insane
Follow them and flatline your brain (brain)
So just bounce to the beat bitch (bitch)
Peep this unique shit (uh)
Ak murder jams and it ain't no secret
Yes, uh
They call me

[Hook - B-Real] (Akrobatik) - w/ ad libs
A to the motherfuckin K homeboy
A to the motherfuckin K (A TO THE K!)
A to the motherfuckin K homeboy
A to the motherfuckin K (A TO THE K!)
A to the motherfuckin K homeboy
A to the motherfuckin K

Uh, yeah, yeah, uh, yeah, yo
Not the gun, but the MC son

[Verse 2 - Akrobatik]
If there is your introduction, then where the fuck you been?
It's been years since my records first started to spin
I'm from the era where you had to work your hardest to win
A lot of records drop, you never heard the artist again
But in my heart is the desire to win
I'm on fire again
Ignire the mic and let it strike my opponents
Blazin through your stereo component from the moment that you press play
It's feelin like the start of your best day
Shit is hella dope, that's what my heads our West say
Hey, ask my homey B-Real from the Hill
Ak got skills plus somethin you can feel
I got pop appeal but I keep it concealed
Like an automatic weapon, but that's not what I'm reppin
I'm reppin no half steppin, that's the lesson
The new era begins now, no more stressin
Let's go (yeah)
Back home they call me

[Hook] - w/ ad libs

What, yeah, yo
Not the gun, but the MC son[Intro]
Told y'all I'm tired of playin with y'all
We tired of playin'
Les

[Hook]
All the bad chicks in the building
Let me see you put your hands to the ceiling
A young G about to cut, God willing
Got her screaming I love this feeling
All the bad chicks in the building
Let me see you put your hands to the ceiling
A young G about to cut, God willing
Got her screaming I love this feeling

[Vamp]
All my wild women get get it on the floor
Get get it on the floor - get get it on the floor
All my, all my wild women get get it on the floor
Get it on the floor - get get it on the floor

[Verse 1]
40 thousand dollars on a gold watch
Still ain't gon' help me tell the time better
Still ain't gon' help nobody rhyme better
I still spend on it so I shine better
Hatin from the side - that's a clown's life
Spending money on these women that's what clowns like
!llmind on the track - you know it sound right
Put my record on and that's what money sound like
Tick tock - click clack
Tell iTunes I need my shit back
New G-Wagen on that pitch black
Show sold out I need that bitch packed

[Hook]

[Vamp]

[Verse 2]
Shorty starin' cause she know that I'll damage her
At least a milli every year with no manager
No label - straight off the iPhone
While you lames is switchin' lanes I'm switching time zones
Ferrari California on Luanda streets
Still ain't gon' help me get to Hell faster
Still want a home out in Redondo Beach
Church of the G's homie I'm the Pastor
Hundred thousand dollars in that offering plate
That's enough to make a nun wanna fornicate
Make her get up out that robe - take her on a date
Told her all we got is now I don't wanna wait

[Hook]

[Bridge]
And baby all we got is right now
All we got is right now
No use in being shy now
Find out right now
All we got is right now
All we got is all our love and
All we got is right now
All we got is right now
And I want you to carry my love child
Baby won't you carry my love child
I want you to carry my love child
Cuz you're the one I care about
Let's just make a love child
I want you to carry my love child
Baby won't you carry my love child
I want you to carry my love
(She aim to please - you don't need to ask her)
I want you to carry my love child
I want you to carry my love child
Baby won't you to carry my love child
Carry my love
I want you to carry my love child
Baby won't you to carry my love child
I want you to carry my love child
Right now

[Outro]
No use counting the days
We've got now there's no need to waste it
Wasting time
Quit wasting time
Quit wasting time-Tex

In the Studio kickin' it with Bads
'Bout to cook it up in the Lab
Sick flows, Sick Verse
Automatic Firearms Disperse
Body in a Black Hearse
Hate to say that's how it goes in my streets
Same ways i can body the beat
I'm Ali with it, stunt with my right then i left hook it
Eyes in both pies now my eyes crooked ..Uhn
I Speak that Mula Mula Language
In my veins got that THC
Flows sting like TCP
Melodies give me TLC
Embedded in the Music
I can show u the worst when my Soul Sails
Lonely nights in a Cold Cell
And that was Way Before ...

-JayBadsTR

Way Before 16 .. Before 16
Sounds like something out that TMC
My Bro's stick with me from the in
'n' now we throwing up W's, Came to be winning
Can't change my path , J.B.T.R
Justifying Black Thoughts, Renounce or Bounce
I keep my songs on loud
Kinda like my bros when they hitting up the...
And i say it how i feel when i think about the...
My head won't stop thinking Cream
My beds tired of all these American Dreams
I'm a fiend for it
Good verse nice Bridge and a mean Chorus
Won't catch my lane if you're coming for it
So i, Keep Killing It, Deep Billing It
Even girlies saying Jay we be Feeling it
Sounds like something out that TMC
Everybody sing along if you're feeling me[Verse 1: Skyzoo]
Ha
Blood type is Yankee blue
Sky came, jumped off the steps and made a coup
My refined lane bust out the left to play the loop
If you sideways come out your neck, bring a noose
From the grey bottom era and one of just a select two
That never change what he wave when all the rest do
My 16's is heron how y'all freeze tag
The city's starting to get heavy in the Supreme bag
Bin was in the duffle
I lift that up a bundle
Fans is bamboo and they been that on the humble
Youngin's get in the way trying divvy up the gold
I Chris Paul the draw put Clippers in the hole
New Yiddy in the room and they saw it from the deck
Half a pound watches, Walker Wear sweats
Logo of the city and double down on that line
In the top by default I don't count past five muhfucka

[Hook: Skyzoo] {x2}
Blue Yankee fitted on daily
Think of a blue Yankee fitted when you hear me
You know the squad
Uh, and the city is on deck
Know when we be on the city gon' rep

[Verse 2: Torae]
They don't respect humble all niggas see is the shine
So I design lines illuminating they mind
Greatest in modern time
They tell you different they lying
The cyclone, Nathan's, and me, vintage C.I
S.K. is the 'Stuy, combine repping the K
Black jackets and ratchets is the new N.W.A
W is on my hoodie and double G is where I lay
Any attempt to threaten will force youngin to spray
All blatant no subliminal diss
So if there's other shots fired I just empty the clip
How more hitting is this?
I'm more sick
I'm more slick with the spit
I talk the panties drawers off of your bitch
I'm more [?]
The pen bars hit the toilet and sit
The boy Tor' still author that shit
Grey bottoms hidden under the crown
So when you see them two letters you know how that sound

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Skyzoo]
From the trunks with spare tires on the back of the door
The top down in the winter be attracting the law
I pull a Michael Michelle off the hype of the rail
And tap dance on a loop like I was [?]
Call me cash money brother
Addicts by the numbers
New York to death when y'all was rapping undercover
I never looked back on the town or where I've came from
The spokesman of the hustle that you was raised on

[Torae]
Son
So how the fuck niggas talking 'bout
They rep the city when they joint sound like Walk It Out?
I deliver the soundtrack to when the hawk is out
Perfect backdrop for when they chalk you out
I've been off the route, march to the beat of the drum
And shoot dope into the needle till the speakers is numb
Uh
Place your bets on the vets
The two man set
Barrel brothers, ain't nar' 'nother a threat

[Hook][Intro: Tony Yayo]
Tougher than leather, nigga. I'm tougher than an African kid running bare-foot in the gullies, nigga. Know what I'm saying? Tough. OG now, nigga. Yeah. Yeah

[Verse 1: Tony Yayo]
To all living things around me
Cash rules everything around me
Your music is unenthusiastic
My jewelry glow in the dark
Škorpion from Serbia, catch you in traffic
20-round clip, curved magazine
And you could leave the Earth over small, little things
John Gotti hit the cake, go bada bing
And you ain't do shit when them things start to ring
South side, we outside, niggas kill, son
They'll Seattle Seahawk you, throwing bullets like Wilson

[Verse 2: Young Buck]
White sheets cover his feet, Ku Klux Klan'ed your man
Left him in the streets, strap in his left hand
The thought of even coming around here was a death plan
And if a nigga cosign that he a "yes man"
Shoot the fuck out of a fuck nigga, I'm all fucked up
So loser, I lose, the dice game getting stuck up
When shit real you get killed around here, it's not a big deal
Load her out, nigga, use my big bitch for a shield
(You know I'm saying?) Thank you for real

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy
When your mouth to be shooting
You find out that we been shooting all along
Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy
You get caught without that Ruger
We put hot shit through you then we gone
Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy
Boy, don't let me catch you slipping, boy, boy
Boy, you know I get to tripping, boy, boy
Boy,  don't let me strap that clip in, boy, boy
Boy, you know I get to tripping, boy, boy

[Verse 3: Tony Yayo]
My money up when them mills come
LA Reid with the dope, son, Jimmy Iovine with the coke, son
Wise time fly by, I'm an OG, bad bitch with double D's
Nigga, Jordan couldn't palm these, feel the breeze
Wrap 'em in satin, they be gone by the morning
Federal subpoenas while SWATs kick the doors in
Fuck up the sheets, the electric tapes to your door though
I show that bitch how to breathe under water
Excusez moi, French bitches bending over
Snatch 'em out the whip, throw 'em in the Range Rover
Snitches and phones, catch the 30 piece from the jewelry
[?] why they texting 'bout [?] body
Frank Lucas put flowers on Bump graves every Tuesday
That's loyalty and don't listen to everything your lawyer say
Red dot, surgery with the laser
Have a nigga missing like that plane from Malaysia

[Verse 4: Kidd Kidd]
Fo' fo's, long nose is Gonzo's
Hundred rounds, drum on the K, that's bongos
Running your mouth with deadly convos, I clap like, "bravo"
Bend back for the encore, nigga, huh
You pussy niggas think you got nine lives
I'mma make sure I stick you more than nine times
With that ice pick I'm a cold killer
You tucking your tail and growing whiskers, rat nigga

[Hook][Verse 1: J'sar]

Is it the Benz steering wheel or the phantom back seat
Or some more niggas dead over black on black beef
We worried ‘bout record sales and illuminati
Copping bootlegs living in public society
Walking hypocrites I’m a human so I contradict
Saying I don’t love hoes hugging the promiscuous
Ayo I told her if she slowed down and if I cared
We could have something real we laughed and passed the L
Drunk memories weeks later “J you don’t remember me”
“The overlook the city suite” I’m drawing a blank
My heart is lame tainted by the Hennessy stains
While telling listeners I’m J’sar remember my name
If I died today would I live another through the words writ
Would I be forgotten did my life serve its purpose
Was the burden of sacrifice really worth it
How will I know will the loch ness monster ever surface

[Hook: J'sar]

Can’t please everybody
Somebody always gone say something
Fuck ‘em

[Verse 2: J'sar]

Approved by the mirror looking at real looking familiar
Watch the quiet type be the stone cold killers
Who laugh with you kick a cypha rap with you
You’ll never meet the psycho if you never have issues
Congratulations on behalf of entertainment
Broke nobodies elevate to rich and famous
Problems that they had before money doesn’t change
Demons seize the soul of somebody you could’ve saved
The Roman Coliseum mentality how do we
Observe somebody at their worst and tune in to fatality
Then you asked what happened you wanted to point and laugh
And when they crash and lit a flame you tweeting R.I.P
Caller I.D. unknown number G O D
That number you didn’t save saved your ass from the grave
Everything we take for granted that we don’t appreciate
You start to want it when you see it taken away

[Hook]

[Verse 3: J'sar]

You play a role do they love the character or actor
We love Scarface but Pacino get his props
De Niro as Jack Byrnes gets the same as when he was
Jimmy Conway Justin Saar J’sar
Its all the same I make a coroner’s theme
Management Paul Bearer check the longevity
Undertake reconstruction of rap it’s fucked up
But not because every ear don’t want the same subject
Who ran it to the ground got money and smiled
Then wanted even more when the profit toppled wow
We used to need you now we don’t fucking need you
Saddam didn’t reign forever
We might as well shine together
If we divide we get conquered it’s written
Or encourage populating the prisons
A record flopping still a tally some digits

[Hook][Produced by !llmind]

[Intro: Phonte]
Woo~! Uhh, Illmind; aiyyo man
I don't know what the fuck they thought this was gon' be y'knahmsayin but
It's like, it's like y'knahmsayin
When you be sittin back listenin to shit like this
Y'know you start takin inventory
Like I know niggas is boppin and shit I know niggas is feelin it but like yo
This is what I been through in the past year
This is where I'm at with my shit now, yo listen

[Phonte]
I used to do it for the fans
'Til I realized that they'd never understand
What I was feelin as a man, fickle as Trav' Bickle
They either hatin you or they a Stan
Then I said I'd do it for my fam
'Til I realized that they didn't give a damn
I stepped out of they comfort zone
Now I can't step, can't step inside my mother's home
Situation so nuts
So much for tryin to be a man
Then I said I'd do it for the props
'Til I realized that the props always seem to stop
When niggas can't keep you all to theyself
Take you home, put you in they little box
Then I said I'd do it for my city
'Til I realized that I shoulda been warned
I stepped inside the ring, rockin my best apparel
My eye on the sparrow, but this torero
Couldn't take the bull city by the horns
So now I'm back on my me shit
Cause me and my team gon' make it do what it do
Had a long hard talk with my nigga Jazzy Jeff
He said, "Fuck 'em 'Te, do it for you!"
So I'm doin it to
Lay up, lay back, in my room with a view
Wanna handle my biz on the low, keep it respectable
Make my music, keep it professional
I know you hate it, what the fuck else is new?

[Hook]
Oh - they say it's in the music
People turn they backs and your friends won't do shit
Feel like a nigga can't win for losing
But they still can't stop the movement
Hey! They say it's in the music
People turn they backs and your friends won't do shit
Feel like a nigga can't win for losing
But they still can't stop the stop
They can't stop the stop
They can't stop the - oh!

[Rapper Big Pooh]
I had to sit and assess
Why all my favorite groups is a mess
Then I'm like they probably split for the best
They had to make room for the rest
Now we on the brink of success
Niggas gettin praised by the press
Niggas gettin backed by ?uest, LB is the new Called Quest
Throwback sound that's fresh, oh yes!
Everybody's hitched to the wagon, best kept secret
Somebody leaked it, inked with a major
Watch how they freak it, gotta show the people we can keep it - tight
Deep down though felt somethin wasn't right
Gotta keep pushin despite
That everybody changed overnight
When them numbers came back light
Now we outta mind, outta sight
Me and 'Te still doin it RIGHT~!

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeah! The great Sam Cooke sang to the world
"A change is gon' come"
I believe a change is here
The change is right now
I wanna give a shout out, to my people that, helped me weather the storm
Y'knahmsayin, my man Pretty Tony, Uncle Joc, O-Dash
We ride together forever my niggas
Yeah... {*fades out*}[Sean Price]
The first verse is the worst
Like why the fuck they call you Jesus Price, nigga?
And you curse in church
Napoleon complex, niggas earth your Lurch
Fuck a hook, nigga, earth my turf
Nah I mean, gave a pound of vile pork, beat Malachi off
Had to slap him in the face, with a Ballantine cloth
Silverback Sean's happy on songs, I ain't dissing
Just you muthafuckas listening wrong, listen
Cock diesel niggas smoking on crack, Tony Atlas
Fast forward flowing, you Thelonious baskets
I mastered ya style and mastered ya styles
I fight the fair one then blast a round wit the pound
Sean is the best, ya'll niggas is the opposite, pa
Shut the fuck up, put a sock in it, pa, be quiet
I put a hole in ya hat, Jesus Price soul controller of rap, amen

[Hook: Flood]
This that hard body shit, punk shotty shit
Niggas shooting the party up over a bitch, shit
This that ignorant shit, niggas pull a trigger, quick
This what ignorance is, yea fire and all this
If you dealing with rich, then we gon' take it
And if you dealing with chips, then we gon' take it
But if you dealing wit tips, ma, then shake it
Cuz my niggas is in this shit, and that's crazy

[Buckshot]
It's the five foot gorilla with the mind of a killa
Killing every nigga in sight, murdered by ya mirror
Ill reflections of a protecting ya face
Bitches tucking in they necklace when I step in the place
Niggas acting like they hard, but they soft as Jell-O
You can tell them niggas pussy, when they walk by, hello
I know, I was scoping you, was hoping I fall
Like a pair on design shorts, no, not at all
I'm not the one, but I got that two
And if you need me to add on more, I bring it through
Cuz I got a trunk for niggas who say they ain't scared
Go for your gun, I let my mack ten braid ya hair
With a little style, I call presto change-o
When the bullets in the chamber, I press it to change, yo
Right back atcha, with the knife and bat atcha
Better ask you could I smack you, if I didn't, I was glad

[Hook]

[Ruste Juxx]
Yeah, run a good tree from the yard, then
Juxx make you lick shots pon de squad, then
I rock rock wit that bang bang boogie
Stomp through hot blocks with that thang thang wit me
It's all gravy and mashed potatoes, I smash haters
Bust bullets, blast tazers, slash razors
Say my rap sheet is longer than my wrap sheet
Young niggas ask me, rhyming to a rap beat
Crack in the days of the eighties
Produced alotta inner city hood crack babies
Bird niggas moving like a chicken with his throat slit
But I bet I lean 'em when I hit 'em wit this dope shit
Never slip, slack off and blowing your back off
Niggas is wack soft, we throwing your track off
Never got a pack off, fuck the jack off
I'mma let the latch off and pop ya cap off

[Hook]Les
I'm tryna see the best of things
Lace my girl, 5 carats in her ring
Get my moms a crib, my pops a new whip
When it's all said and done - stack a mil for my kids
Work hard, play hard, stack dough, live well
Get away
Stay on an island in my own hotel
Got my little sister proud - like, check him out
She happy I put a pool in her house - she love to swim
I'm known for my taste in ladies
Plus a Murcielago and a pair of twin grey Mercedes
Staties leave me alone when I cruise the expressway
Can't touch me the community loves me
I'm on the news shaking hands
Had to give back
Salvation Army get a hundred grand
And - I own a company of which I'm the chair
I'm the boss, El Jefe premiere
And I'm knowin' they stare
When they see me at the Rolex store
On the low - the rose gold cost a hundred and 4
That's a house on the arm, couple cars on the wrist
Yea - success served cold is a remarkable dish
When they see me, yea - they might stand around for a photo
Watch for a king, got a crown for a logo
Owe it all to God, so the greatest, I thank
The whole team gettin' green, celebrate at the Bank
Yea- that volcano flow slow burn thru your stereo
You know what the business is, you know the scenario
Black Mozart flow, hated like the Taliban
With a black fur coat made of astrakhan
Thick in the club, man, you know I'mma turn up
Money here to get, homie, you know I'mma earn up
Ace for the entourage, bring the Methuselah
Envy make haters turn green like arugula
Still make a fool of you - 'Pagne (pain) in a gold bottle
Stunt hard these lames need a role model
Shorty with the pretty face that's my plus one
Feature presentation - word to Suss One
Gold on the wrist - no time for the gimmicks
Living a self-made "Sweet Dream" Annie Lennox
Class in session, hope you all in attendance

Someone is always doing what someone else said could not be done

[Hook:]
Ayo, I'm fed up, fed up with the bullshit
Artists are bullshit, Industry bullshit
I put my time and energy in all this bullshit
And the return on my investment is bullshit

[Verse 1: Anyextee]
So it's time to turn the tables and invest in myself
Im the C-E-O, I put myself on the shelf
Take your shit off, make sure it never sells
You inconsiderate shits are bad for my health
Cease and desist, the reason is this
Your thievery emits plots of deviousness
I been had my money right, shits straight dick face
Built Amalgam Digital off hustlin' Mixtapes
You never walked in my shoes
Put yourself in my position, I don't expect you to listen
This is for the risk taker, the entrepreneur
The big chip makers chillin' on the top floors
From play writes behind the scenes to young hustlers
Without us You ain't nuffin you ungrateful muthafuckers


[Hook:]
Ayo, I'm fed up, I'm fed up with the bullshit
Artists are bullshit, industry bullshit
I put my time and energy in all this bullshit
And the return on my investment is fuck you

[Verse 2: Anyextee]
Now, I see you like shittin' where your eatin'
You spoiled lil' brats need to stop, look, and reason
You think its talent alone that brings you success?
Without the proper management you will not touch checks
You will not touch cash, You won't become blessed
You'll be the same baby clutching on your mom's breast
I'm the voice of the labels in the industry
The same voice against the standard of the labels in the industry
Speak the truth, I'm nobodies puppet
From A&Rs, executives, sponsorships, publishing
Big wigs, to majors, your not even a player
Who can save you from the reality that Anyextee makes paper?
The paper trail of my existence is write off
Now take your ass to bed and don't forget to shut the lights off

[Hook:]
Ayo, I'm fed up, I'm fed up with the bullshit
Artists are bullshit, industry bullshit
I put my time and energy in all this bullshit
And the return on my investment is fuck you{Verse 1: Myone}
Soon as I open my eyes, I realize that I could be gone
The days of our lives don't take long
And any moment you blink
Might be another golden moment extinct
And I'm just hoping that you only would think, maybe re-think
Cause my mission's not to kill or cause friction
It's non-fiction
And every living man's a walking contradiction
As dark and light collab to make a full composition
I know experience is not opted or propositioned
If I chose to not listen
When I was caught in a spot without a pot to piss in
I probably wouldn't be spittin'
While I'm knowing that the block is hot
I stand firm like Al Sharp's perm and give it all that I've got
We're tryin' to tear down the walls of hate to bring change
And some of ya'll scream bump the Strange
They just haters perhaps
Either way man they better relax
An ex-con that's about to relapse
Then grabbed a hold of the mic
Cause ya'll brotha's wasn't holdin' it right
And I'm a flow until the closing of light to bring change
And then some

{Hook}

{Verse 2: Myth}
I see the times have changed
But in the eyes of some
Yo, we still the same niggas
Go figure
Parents is cold killers
Killing their seeds
With no conscience, left and right
Not afraid of pulling them triggers
As we enter the troubled times
Sometimes I feel I'm better off
Mumbling rhymes
Cause ya'll ain't trying to listen anyway
Crumbling minds
Understand the words spoken from a poet
I know it
We need to bring the love back
And put it in their soul, kid

{Verse 3: Res}
We all struggle with change but see it won't happen fast
God shines through the insecurity shown on the news casts
Casting fear into the hearts of us all
Pushing carts through these halls
Of these markets consuming these products
That they say will change and sustain our lives
Why our wives are on Atkins, our daughters on Botox
Father's asking for pills to kill his depression
Those are only symptoms guiding light is misdirected

{Hook}

Welcome to the struggle
Where a poet’s gotta rhyme hustle
Going through it blind
Cus I know it's more then mind and muscle
When the Divine humbles my pride crumbles
My eyes bubble with tears
Making it clear where I stumble
It’s like I’m double when in trouble I got two sides
My life’s a puddle to the sudden glimpse of blue skies
Carry the rain away it varies from day to day
No matter where we say we’ve changed
Remember Who remains the same
We sending prayers out in His name
With the hopes it might help you cope
Giving the praise to God if you felt what I wrote
Head nodding till I melt into notes
Heart throbbing put a swell in my throat
Smooth sailing till we fell of the boat
Now we swimming in sin
Treading waiting for our ship to come in
Deep breath just before the water entered my chest
The Author of Life offered His life vest[Hook]
Everybody wants the fortune and fame
The more things change , the more they stay the same
This industry is like a crap game
Sometimes you gotta charge it to the rap game
Sometimes you gotta charge it to the rap game
Sometimes you gotta charge it to the rap game
This industry is like a crap game
Sometimes you gotta charge it to the rap game

[Verse 1]
Where do I begin
Well, the industry shady not everybody is your friend
I had to learn that shit the hard way
In and out bogus contracts since before i was rapping in the hallway
Everyone out for money, executives out for blood
If you don't keep the music current then labels'll pull the plug (Get it)
Hard to admit when shit don't go the way you plan
While everybody's on Instagram just fronting like life is brand
Take it back to one of my first tours
Fuckin' everything movin' thinkin' groupies will never do nothing back to us
Kick 'em out the hotel swearing i hit my finer things
Lost a bunch of jewelry from a Rolex to a diamond chain (Bitch)
How in the hell did i get caught slippin'
Meanwhile on all my records , nigga talkin' bout he pimpin'
Maybe i exaggerated a lil bit
You know fake it till you make it every one of us rappers gotta talk a little shit
Yeah i done smashed some video vixens and some actresses
But brand name pussy don't feel no different on my matresses
Insecure hoes with breast jobs and butt shots
Blaming on us rich niggas sponsoring shit and what not
Now guys are just as big as groupies as these women is
Till you break up and a bitch wonder where her percentage is
While these regular hoes are trying to play the trap game
And now is the time i blame it on the rap game

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Listen , this ain't scripted this reality
It take some drugs for us to conquer this insanity
Thieves using our name promoting these fake appearances
Publicists overcharging taking years for these clearances
I got sued some rappers said i stole their joint nigga
Spend half a million just to prove a fucking point nigga
We got the fans thinking rappers never lose
Gave a producer a hundred grand for a beat i never use (Damn)
The false stories and being misquoted in magazines
Got a nigga wanting to go and load a couple magazines
Head to your office and shoot up the whole fucking staff
Post that on your website and burn while i fucking laugh
You protesters at my concerts y'all make me sick
I thought i told y'all i would never disrespect a bitch
It's clear to see that Hip Hop's under attack man
Or is it cause that no one wants to see a rich black man
Really they want us with no money
Hungover and missing flights and cutting our show money
Hip Hop cops still lurkin' and trying to catch us slippin'
And put us in a position to make some real life decisions (Hmmm)
Or do we just be doing dumb shit
Emptying out these gun clips and always on the run shit
Lifestyles of us entertaining hood niggas
If it's bad to be a rapper what's good nigga

[Hook][Verse 1: Havoc]

Foul shit I'm on it like flies on shit...

Foul shit I'm on it like flies on shit
You're in the presence of realness keep your eyes on this
Stare too long, fuck around, turn into stone
My ruga like medusa and my goons like drones
Hover over battlefields like we in a warzone
E.T. niggas get shook, want to phone home
Trying to use a lifeline but nobody got them answers
Big guns, pulling out them M.C. Hammer dances
No time to get caught the judge throwing books
Like niggas read, we just know about the jooks
Clipped L's in my ashtray
Higher than a motherfucker I'm half baked
Spending money like I never even had cake
On my b-day being broke left a bad taste
And a phobia, crib full of cash homey a
Bitch walked in I said welcome to utopia

[Hook]

Look up to look at us
We stars, stare at us
We are them niggas check the motherfucking credits (repeat x2)

[Verse 2: Prodigy]

Check us out bitch
Ass nigga

Where your money and your things at
Put it all on the infamous when it's from Queens
We a safe bet, astrology will say that
Mobb Deep got that forever wave you're just a ripple in the past
Ocean of opiate flow
The empire dope needle state boys like the building stand tall
Don't make me have to fast you up, nigga I fix you
The young lady wanna come with me, let her through
There's no need to grab her arm like that, stop resisting
You're fighting, wasting all our time, you embarrassing
Your own self, look at you now
Stretched out staring up at the twilight, security bound
You took my cavalier attitude for being a bluff
I took your woman, she gave me gratitude in the truck
She want this legendary dick in her life, I got that glow
Street credit score A-1, like you ain't know

[Hook][Verse 1]
Alife hoodies for when the wind move
A lifestyle like no other how you want it
When you jumping out your covers then you cover what you're into
And pray to whoever you praise that you live through
Living for the light til the light becomes a signal
And signals to you as the one to empty a clip to
Then it turns round like the signals on the dial
And the lights hop up outta nowhere like they the cymbals
Cue 'em, and watch 'em get to moving like a heart rate
Looking for a dimmer, get to cooking all winter
And you looking more Blizzard and this turns into a bar raid
"aight everybody, strip and get your your arms raised!"
Check day jumping, chest plate thumping
Freestyle to it, don't a neck brace want it
Soundtrack to the shooter, the soundtrack to it
The background music how the background do us
For the civilized leisure

[Hook]
This leisure needs to be civilized
Gotta have it, its already mine
Its already ours, its already ours

[Verse 2]
And it appears, the scent is in the air
The smell of Rosè and a nickel plated glare
The bezè rotates while the middle make 'em stare
Heavy on the bass, let it kick away your fears
Heavy on the bass like the symbolism there
There like a cling on, fear like the ring on
That's left to the left of the fears that you swing on
Fall up outta pocket like the cymbal isn't there
Cue 'em, and let 'em find lane like the plug
And it u­turns to a pillow case and a rug
And the truth turns to the middle lane being plugged
And you dealing with the outskirts, spilling like a outburst
The doors shut and they forget to let you out first
The trap literally jumping and you stuck in
Being everything you saw when you wanted even more
And you think of how the lights wasn't bright enough at all
For the civilized leisure

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
They say "Sky your story don't ever change up"
It never will, it's everything that I say it was
Forever will be centered on how we came up
On Tryna be in the center of where the cake be
They told us keep it the same and if the cake leave
Make the loyalty stay and let your name breathe
May whoever's beside me have the same speed
Civilized where the leisure can take me
Civilized leisureIntro:
Si j ecoute ma famille je devrai croire qu il existe/
Un être qui/ dirige nos vies à travers celle ci/
Mais j ai subit ses pires choix/ si j en croit ses dires/
Donc vaut mieux qu j me dise/ qu après il y a que l'vide/
J'suis un jeune type qui taf sans être proche de ses poches/ Maman!
J crois plus aux cieux mais je crois en mes proches!/
Tu vas m dire, t as peur que cette confiance aveugle me viol/
Mais j en baisse pas mon froc/ j suis toujours maître de ce qu on m donne/
Mais Dieu est venu et m a montré qui est l boss/
Il m a arraché ma vie et ce depuis qu j suis un gosse/
Aujourd hui avoir une fille c est preuve que je combat la mort/
J suis negre pas d bol parcke mon dos résiste encore/

1er couplet:
11 pige a paname/ sous mon lit pleins d cafards/
Nouveau dans l'coin tu dois montrer qu't'as pleins d'panaches/
Seul dans mon monde a frapper le ballon sur la place/
J'm imaginai marqué mais pour ça fallait qu'il y ait des cages/
Entre charclo et camé/ mon beau reup s'était armé/
De stylo, de poings, de batte et de pointe qui venait de l'armée/
Mais on  sentai désarmé/ quand l'hosto voulait le garder/
Mon reuf kidnappé? Il aurai fallu m'cané!/
Et la d'un coup tu crois que l'orage est passé/
Que l'été arrive/ qu tu vas profiter de tes aimés/
Alors on m'dit d'aller faire un tour/ le soir avec un saoul/
J y ai rien vu dessous/ j ai cru qu j allait juste boire un coup/
Mais c'est la qu j ai reçu un coup/ j ai su rester debout/
Tout est devenu flou/ c est la qu j ai compris qu'la vie était fourbe/
J était plus sur la bonne route/ mon père n'y était plus du tout/
Vivant déjà à genou j'sentai qu'on me poussait dans l trou/


Refrain:
J'avais faim, je suis devenu pêcheur x4


2e couplet:
Tu cherche un taf/ tu m dira c'est l taf d un homme en âge/
Tu t lève tard parcke t as honte que tu n paye aucune charge/
Aux entretiens on te dit bien qu'ici tu n volera rien/
Est ce parcke j suis black et qu en cravate au fond je n ressemble a rien?/
Pleins d'rêves/ d'ambitions et pleins d'projets/
Aucun regret/ ma vie m'a refaite/
Le ventre vide/ tu captes vite le besoin d fermer la fenêtre/
Et juste la tu signes/ et tu vois l'bout du tunnel/
Mais la d'un coup je crois que l'orage est passé/
Que l'été arrive/ que je vais profiter d'mes aimés/
Alors j propose de faire un tour/ cette fois avec mes sous/
On va assister a des cours après on ira boire un coup/
Mais c'est la qu'j'ai reçu un coup/ crois moi j voulais quitter la route/
Mon petit frère n'verra plus l'jour/ alors qu'j'ai mon souffle/
Et on m'fou encore a genou/ a croire qu'on veut pas m'voir debout/
J pense que le problème, c'est que je ne sème que l'amour


Refrain
J'avais faim, je suis devenu pêcheur x4


Outro:
J'ai pas attendu les signes pour avancer
J'me sent comme un gars à qui on a tout balancé
Ok, j'm'en tape, c'est comme ca[Verse 1 - Skyzoo]
The life of Kings and everything we call it
The realization of everything that we forfeit
The last scene of the night, with no applaudin
Tryin to circle back to when the curtains were called in
I talk to you, cause you told me to throw my all in
And now it feels like I'm too far in
Told me regardless, as long as I could show you where the heart is
Another day shouldn't be a problem
But now the more I come to you, the more it feel like, real life
Couldn't of been built right, you told me to still write
Said that you would help me make sense of it all
And we would never have to censor our talks
So I told you everything, I never worried about if you could hear
I assumed your attention was a sign of how you cared
See with you, I was different, I ain't try to hide fear
Nor anger, nor excitement
Played you my life as, quick as I was livin it
Gave you my life as, quick as I could give you it
And never had a second thought
Hopin is for the better and forever more
I put you in front of everyone around me
From the first moment that you found me
BFF, I fell for it, by far I fell
And you was the help for it that I would call myself
So if your ears are off or tainted in the least
Then how can I explain this to me?

[Hook - Skyzoo]
So now I'm like - dear whoever
When I put this together
I felt like severin ties, may work better
I felt like steppin aside, instead of together
Could be the best thing for the both of us, forever

Dear whoever
When I put this together
I felt like severin ties, may work better
I felt like steppin aside, instead of together
Could be the best thing for the both of us, forever
Forever, forever

[Verse 2 - Skyzoo]
In all honesty, plannin on how to leave
Is just more proof of the fact that I'm all out of me
Just more truth that exactly the way I tried to be
Was either too much or not enough
No middle ground, so to talk to you and pen it down
Is not as easy no more, I think different now
The idea of tellin you what I wouldn't repeat
Only for you to be wrong is what I couldn't believe
Ran to you anytime I was lookin for me
And I took your advice on how to carry it
No barriers, no doubtin you
Until doubt was the only thing I knew how to do
When the doors close on me, day ones fold on me
You would get a hold of me and tell me to word it
But shit is gettin old on me, shit is monotone homie
Same metronome homie, I already heard it
Same metronome homie, I already heard it
Feelin like everyone before me who support me
Is deservin of a reason to applaud me
And if I ain't able to give 'em that much
Due to how we matched up
I could of scripted out a different story
I threw all caution to the wind, when you told me it was worth it
And pictured that the picture would be perfect
At the end of the day, dear notebook, thanks for all the listens
But we should probably both stop pretendin

[Hook]

[Outro - Skyzoo - talking]
Dear whoever, dear whoever, dear whoever
When I put this together
Felt like severin ties, may work better
Felt like steppin aside, instead of together
Be the best thing for the both of us, forever
