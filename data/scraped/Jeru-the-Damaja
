[Produced by DJ Premier]

[Verse 1]
You wanna front, what, jump up and get bucked
If you're feeling lucky duck then press your luck
I snatch fake gangster MCs and make 'em faggot flambé
Your nine spray, my mind spray
Malignant mist that'll leave Kant defunkt
The result's your remains stuffed in a car trunk
You couldn't come to the jungles of the East popping that yang
You won't survive get live catching wreck is our thing
I don't gang bang or shoot out bang bang
The relentless lyrics the only dope I slang
I'm a true master you can check my credentials
Cause I choose to use my infinite potential
Got a freaky, freaky, freaky freaky flow
Control the mic like Fidel Castro locked Cuba
So deep that you can't scuba dive
My jive's origin is unknown like the Jubas
I've accumulated honeys all across the map
Cause I'd rather bust a nut than bust a cap
In your back in fact my rap snaps your sacroilliac
I'm the mack so I don't need to tote a Mac
My attack is purely mental and its nature's not hate
It's meant to wake ya up out of your brainwashed state
Stagnate nonsense, for if you persist
You'll get your snotbox bust you press up on this
I flip, hoes dip, none of the real niggas skip
You don't know enough math to count the mics that I've ripped
Peep the Dirty Rotten scamp as his verbal weapons spit

[Hook]
Oh-oh! Heads up cause we're dropping some shit!
(Scratched x4)

[Verse 2]
Real, rough and rugged, shine like a gold nugget
Every time I pick up the microphone I drug it
Unplug it on chumps with the gangster babble
Leave your nines at home and bring your skills to the battle
You're rattling on and on and ain't saying nothing
That's why you got snuffed when you bumped heads with Dirty Rotten
Have you forgotten, I'll tap your jaw
I also kick like kung fu flicks by Run Run Shaw
Made frauds bleed every time I g'd
Cause I've perfected my drunken style like Sam Seed
Pseudo psychos, I play like Michael Jackson
When I'm busting ass and breaking backs
Inhale the putrified aroma
Breathe too deep and you'll wind up coma
Toast the king I'm hard like a fifth of vodka
And bring your clique cause I'm a hard rock knocker
I gotcha out on a limb about to push you off the plank
Let you draw your chronz but your burner shot blanks
When the East is in the house you should come equipped

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Fly like a jet, sting like a hornet
Knuckleheads get live and set it off if you want it
Dirty Rotten Scoundrels is crushing fools no joke
With styles more fatal than second hand smoke
Don't provoke the wrath of this rhyme inventor
Cause I blow up spots like the World Trade Center
Come with the super trooper on his assault mission
The tek's technique cause he's a technician
Wishing he'll go away won't help the weapons stop
The skills are shot cause any idiot can let off a Glock
Hard rocks melt in the clutch of the sun toucher
You claim you got beef on the streets, so what ya
Gonna do when real niggas roll up on you
And you don't got your crew
Pull your Glock but you don't got the heart
You was webbed straight from the start
Bought a tool and didn't learn how to use it
Got lost in Brooklyn so you had to lose it
Just for fronting you got that ass whipped

[Hook x3][Intro]
"We did it like that and now we do it like this"
"We did it like that and now we do it like this"

[Verse 1: Chubb Rock]
Now clock, kids, who got the cocaine?
Don't tell me it's the little kids on Soul Train
The metaphor sent from my brain to my jaw
It comes from other places, not the tinted faces
Journalistic values are yellow and then of course falters
You watch Channel Zero with that bitch Barbara Walters
She'll have you believe black invented crack
When President Lyndon had the formula way back
In '63 with Kennedy, yes the double cross
Remember that's when they blow his fucking head off
Vietnam vets come back looking like one-armed pets
Nixon bounced pure checks
No picket fence, no job, no 8-Cylinder car
Blue collar turns to bourgeois
Depressed in your chest, Demerol, for sess
No dough, crack in vials much less
Whitey can sell on the corners of Bushwick
Whitey can sell on the corners of Flatbush
White Tees can sell on the corners of Bed-Stuy
Pass the torch to that nigga guy
So just die, nigga, die, nigga
You're too black, you can't handle, you're too strong
Get high, fly clock next boost ya steal
In '95 we take back Ebbets Field

[Verse 2: O.C]
Brooklyn, traveling distance to party
Brooklyn, absent at functions, not hardly
Brooklyn, the name alone holds Godly
You don't know, you better ask somebody
Crack filled streets since '85
The beast getting paid to not bust, hookers drawers got crust
Claps clapping regular, hardcore niggas with
Fat gold chains, on the corner maintaining
Gold teeth flashing, stick-up kids playing in front of
Latin Quarters, keep home your daughters
Cause if bullets fly, watch the flaming
Ignorant ducks are shooting wilding, they're not aiming
One Easter, now I think about it, what a pity
Five people died in front of Skate City
Senseless, back then you was ill if you had a gun
People dashing flashing, damn no fun
Albee Square you couldn't shop too much cause
Fort Greene would hem ya wreck the fuck on up
You had Do or Die, East New York, mad hell
Fellas cutting school trooping to all go Maxwell
So many memories I can't manifest
Yo 'Ru, start where I finish and to Brooklyn, God bless

[Scratched Hook]
"Crazy ass Crooklyn kids"
"Represent the Brooklyn all-nighter"
"Crazy ass Crooklyn kids"
"Because it is, survival of the fittest"
(Repeat x2)

[Verse 3: Jeru the Damaja]
Listen cause for your mind I got the right nutrition
We keeps shit hard like fat asses and cases of Heineken
Here in Brooklyn, home of the warrior and villain
Trife type chicks, Top Billin's the anthem
Rastas smoke marijuana
Enterprising businessmen shoot dice on the corner
Excuse me while I light my spliff but some choose to sip
So bullets hit brains, when bottles hit lips
Clips whatever happened to 38 special
Now it's Desert Eagles, government issue
Probably the same one that killed Noriega
Chips that powered nuclear bombs power my Sega
Subliminal hypnotism and colonialism
Leave most niggas dead or in prison
In Crook-land, right hand cuts off the left hand
To spite the hand, jealous of the next man
So violent crimes, black on black plus mad crack to boot
Everybody can't rap, so most hustle and shoot
Make money money, get money, take money
I can't understand that concept cause Jah rules everything around me
Fire burns the unjust like arson larceny
Melt MC's with mental telepathy
With precision, we're slicing and dicing
Peace to the East New York, Perverted Monks, and Mike Tyson

[Scratched Hook x2]

Crooklyn (2X)[Verse 1: Mad Lion]
Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why
Why does a DJ test and he end up die
I know, I know, I know, I can't explain
Pack up a shot just blow dem brain
Who are the man with the gun inna his hand
Step up on the scene like Captain Caveman
You want the music everybody scream louder
Lick bare shot and smell the gun powder

[Verse 2: Doug E. Fresh]
On and on and on and on...
Yo, freestyle flow to make the crowd just go
The old to the new, the new to the old
{Beatbox} The rhythm be working up on me
The crowd be jumping up for me, the people are waiting up on me
To enter the stage in the rage, Mad Lion's out the cage
Now it's time for me to engage, uhh
And bear witness, the lyrical fitness
The jumps, the dives, the leaps, are you getting this?
Next to step up, microphone check up
KRS-ONE, so come and get your wreck up

[Verse 3: KRS-ONE]
Our mother who art in Heaven number seven is the weapon
With the Goddess I'm stepping lyrically I'm never begging, you know
I'm the difference between indo and oregano
Imagine how fresh I am now, I made these lyrics up a year ago
So report back it was fat, fit, all that, quick, pump that, drop the S-hit
I'm lyrically physically fit
Catch me bugging on the mic, every day and every night
Every hour, every second, man it don't stop, get it, get it
Yes, admit it when I'm way up in it
You can't hide cause my radar's going bibip bibip bibip
I reside in the watchtower watching MCs land
Your career will be as short as my part in "Who's The Man"
Goddamn I'm the pinnacle, yes the metaphysical
Come to you as the rap god of lyrical syllables
Fall to your knees, bring fruit, ask advice
Put your rhymes on the altar, burn them as a sacrifice
The aroma reaches up to my nostril
I get hostile, your lyrics are stiff like David Koppel
Yes Premier rocks the track on time
KRS-ONE with off of the top of the head rhyme
Yeah Fat Joe, you know you got a flow
My man Doug E Fresh down with the one called KRS
We got the mad MCs up in the D&D
I'm out, G

[Verse 4: Fat Joe]
Yeah!
Motherfuckers know who's the best
If it ain't Fat Joe then it must be Lord Finesse
Think not, then show what you got
But don't grab this mic, the shit's too hot
I'm the born killer, nigga from the Bronx
Rappers talk shit but there's really no comp
Bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing
Yeah, so Smif-n-Wessun if you're down with me
Represent one time on the M-I-C

[Verse 5: Smif-n-Wessun]
Mr. Ripper, get your gear and prepare for war
Mr. Vickster, you ain't gotta tell me no more
Cause what I see, on the daily
Deals with reality, so come follow we on this journey
Through Brooklyn where the crooks dwell in the projects overlooking
In the form of the streets, you know them well
Bet your ass this grass is greener
Than a 20 sack of sensimila brought straight from Medina
You know the vibe when Smif-n-Wessun twist up the Thai
Peace to my people in the Ville, peace to my heads in the Stuy
We do or die, we test your stamina
So any challenger we pass the motherfucker off to the Damaja

[Verse 6: Jeru the Damaja]
Super scientifical madness
My status is the baddest every time I bless the apparatus
You wish to take me out, so you study
Meanwhile my clothes, mics and foes are left bloody
Cruddy, filthy from the ground on up
When I plan my attack I doubt that you're ready
Rain on competition like razor sharp confetti
Kung Fu techniques from the perverted monastery
Sifu Ru manipulates the microphone
And rhymes like bullets penetrate your zone
See we bring more drama than Kevin Costner
No I'm not Jamaican but yes I'm a RastaParty people, in the place to be
From the same man, who brought you Da Bichez
(Da Bichez, Da Bichez, Da Bichez)
We were misunderstood, last time we brought you
Ba Bichez (Da Bichez Da Bichez)
Now we gonna clear it up and let you make up your own mind
Like this...

Now a queen's a queen, and a whore is a whore
She felt if she made me wait I'd have more respect for her
Adore her, eventually spendin up my digits
She felt that love would make me buy her mad material shit
She likes to trick em, cause ain't nothin like a sleepin victim
East New York style stick em -- ha ha ha, stick em
Top rated game, but if it's game I played it
Underestimated, swore the king was checkmated
She claims she loves my mind, cause I'm so intelligent
But fuck my mental, she was scheming on my mint
Evil inten-tion, to de-plenish the fund
She tried to jux me with the pussy cept for, the mask and gun
I was a fool to fall in lust with this evil ge-nius
She had me by the nuts
She ain't got shit but man she loves it plush
Whippin I whip, and suckin up I canibus
Back in the days, I woulda scraped her for this caper
But I realize, it wasn't me it was the paper

Let me kick it, about the digits, that I've collected
Long distance, and disconnected, it's gettin hectic
Before my record, they didn't show it
But now they throw it, hopin that they'll get drunk off Moet
Or Cristal, but that's not my par-ticular style and taste
My name ain't herb and I ain't got loot to waste
I ain't got time to waste, bad bitches is all up in my face
Crazy ignorant, sweatin links minks and shit
Cosmetic, but deep down, derelict
Fake players, never get out the projects
It's pathetic -- the way she bends for dividends
I tried to jewel her but she tried to get a drink at the end
Of our con-vo-sation, I did not have the patience
Slid off to the next Asian
She said, "What you do?" I said, "What?"
She said, "You know your occuptation?"
So I broke the fuck out
In nineteen-ninety-six that's what it's all about, but
I won't go that route
Back in the days Biz said it was The Vapors
But today, I realize that it's the papers

"Cause ain't no fiends comin in between me and my dreams
See what I mean black, I" -- "gets the paper"
(repeat 3X)

Now a whore's a whore, find a queen and she'll be my Earth
Respect love and protect her, for all that it's worth
I admit I have flaws, I flips it first, but deep down
I wishes to give em the universe
A lot of the ones that I thought was right wasn't
I build with Afu, he said "Don't sweat it cause they come a dime a dozen"
Like my ex-stunt, wanted a diamond
Bitches love power, while queens, love refinement
Low stress environment, old age and retirement
Never have to wonder where my money went
Where my honey went, is her back gettin twisted
By the next fella, always take heed to what I tell her
When I'm wrong, she lets me know I need correction
When I'm right she's my reflection still we, use protection
Through thick and thin, thin and thick
She's my diamond in the rough not a whore or a trick
Great expectations, of me and she buildin nation
Everything we do and skyscrapin
Back in the days, the devil used to rape her
Nowadays, he got her chasin the paper

"Cause ain't no fiends comin in between me and my dreams
See what I mean black, I" -- "gets the paper"
(repeat 4X)Verse One:
Now I don’t be foolin' around, I tell the truth. Nothing’s secret

As devils search for the secrets to immortality
I alter my physical chemistry
Walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I exist even when no things are left
Vibrations transcend space and time
Pure at heart because I deal with the mind
That's why I compose these verses
Audible worlds, my thoughts are now universes
Written on these pages is the ageless
Wisdom of the sages, ignorance is contagious
So I hope you keep your focus
There's no hocus-pocus, in the end, it's just us
Devil got brother killin brother, it's insane
Goin out like Abel and Cain
Wisen up and use your brain
There'll be no limit, to the things that you can gain
In positivity, balance it with negativity
Until then, ain't the devil happy

[Hook]
[Scratching in the RZA's famous laugh on the song "Tearz" by The Wu-Tang Clan]

Verse Two:

I hate when the devil's happy, so I wear my hair hair nappy
Knotty, won't go out like John Gotti
He came from the caves to destroy everybody
And we like fools destroy our own bodies
Too many niggas chillin, bad boys boom boom
This leaves no room for the flowers to bloom
Seeds blow in the wind, another drug killing
What, are we accomplishing? Nothing
What's, the matter?
Why everytime I look around another brain gets splattered?
Some pockets get fatter but it don't matter
The devil's the only one who really gets fatter
Lead ruptures flesh, spleens are shattered
Dreams are shattered, another Queen without a King
What will out children become without proper guidance?
Probably nothing, so ain't the devil happy

Verse Three:

Niggas are in a state of nothingness
Hopelessness, lifelessness
If you're in range I hope you hear this
And try to change this, cause it's disastrous
Who gets the most loot, who gets bust?
Dollar bill y'all, is the god we trust
THe days blow by like dust
Even Men of Steel rust
We're out here acting ridiculous
When, only we can save us
Mentally enslave us, for little or nothing kill our neighbors
Animalistic, caniballistic, behavior
Look to the sky for your savior
He won't save ya, he didn't save your forefathers
Why bother, brothers? You must discover
The power of self, know thyself, or find thyself
Hating thyself, killing thyself
While he collects the wealth that you sit back and murder for
Ain't the devil happyGuy 1: Ohhh! Yo look towards the darkness
Guy 2: Nah nah yo, look towards the light
Guy 1: Yo what! Oh what the? Yo what is that?
Guy 2: It's a supernova
Guy 1: Nah nah man, that's a black hole
Guy 2: Yo! Yo!
Guy 1: Yo!
1 + 2: Yo it's.. IT'S.. IT'S?!!!

[The Prophet]
I, leap over lies in a single bound (Who are you?)
The Black Prophet
One day I got struck by Knowledge of Self
It gave me super-scientifical powers
Now I, run through the ghetto
Battlin my, arch nemesis Mr. Ignorance
He's been tryin to take me out since the days of my youth
He feared this day would come
I'm hot on his trail, but sometimes he slips away
Because he has an army, they always give me trouble
Mainly - Hatred, Jealousy and Envy they attack me
They think they got me
But I use my super-science and I twist all three
I see sparks over that buildin' - they're shootin' at me
I dip, do a backflip
Then hit em in the heart with sharp steel bookmarks
Ignorance hates when I drop it
But no matter, what he do.. he can't stop the Prophet

[Deceit]
Yo Prophet, yo Prophet, c'mere real quick
Yo I just saw Ignorance downtown, let me put you on

[Girl #2]
Word, he down there buggin'
He got them illin' out, they shootin' and everything else

[The Prophet]
Let's continue the saga, mad mad drama
I met this chick, she said she knew where Ignorance was at
I said, "Where?"
She said, "Downtown"
He had babies havin' babies - and young niggas sellin' crack
I think the bitch is lyin, it's a set up
I can smell it, but Ignorance is runnin' rampant
Aight baby show me the exact spot
Meet me at Hoyt and Schermerhorn at 3 on the dot
So I hops up on the A-Train, I'm bein' followed
My seventh sense senses danger
I turn around, it's Anger
And he brought a mob along, it's the same old song
Despair and Animosity got broke with the swiftness
I don't know what they think this is
I feel a sharp pain in my neck
Now I can't see, I'm like Hiram
They hit me with the dart filled with the pork chop serum
I tried to hold on but before long I dropped
When I awoke I was locked in the barber's shop
Trapped in the barber's chair
Oh no, they're gonna try and cut my hair
But that can't stop the Prophet

[Anger]
Yo Prophet!
Ignorance is tired of you followin' him around
We about to put an end to that RIGHT NOW
Anamosity (YEA!) Despair (YO WHASSUP?) Get him!!

{DJ Premier cuts and scratches: "Can't a damn thing stop me"}

[The Prophet]
A few minutes passed by, I hear a buzzin' noise
It was that chick with some of Ignorance's boys
She said, "Prophet, we got you beat;
By the way I'm Mr. Ignorance's wife, Deceit
But enough talk; now for your hair cut.."
When the clippers touched my hair, they blew the fuck up
After the explosion there was no one left
Cause I know Dim Mak/poison hand/touch of death
My vision's still kinda blurry, but I see a clue
Ignorance is at the library
I hurry, with lightning speed like The Flash
He's at the big one, on Grand Army Plaz'
When I get inside the doors shut and the lights go off
Damn, another trap
I hear a hissin' sound, I smell a funny smell
I gasp, I can't breathe
Ignorance is laughin' at me
Waitin' on my downfall, but he can't stop the Prophet

[Mr. Ignorance]
Well Prophet
It seems like you're in a bit of a jam
I hope you can unstick yourself
Oh, and what you did to my wife, it was nothing
I have others
Hahahahahaha... hahahahaha.. hahahahahah

"The saga continues!"[Verse 1]
Now, I don't push a Lex
Others had their turn to flex, Jeru is up next
All these so called players up in the rap game
Got brothers on the corner selling cooked cocaine
It used to be LaToya and jim hats
But now it's Uzis, Macs and G-packs of cracks
Everybody's psycho or some type of good fellow
But me I keep it real that's all swine like jello
Don't drink Cristal, and I can't stand Mo
Never received currency for moving a kilo
Or an ounce, make em bounce to this fake-pimp-free flow
I never knew hustlers confessed in stereo
Or on video get caught you'll know who turned state's
Evidence, murder weapon, confession and fingerprints
Mama always said watch what comes out your mouth
Tight case for the DA from here to down South
Knowledge wisdom understanding like King Solomon's wealth
You're a player but only because you be playing yourself

[Hook]
With all that Big Willie talk, hop, you're, playin' yaself
With all that big gun talk, bop, you're, playin' yaself
With all that rah rah rah, you're, playin' yaself
You're, playin' yaself, you're, playin' yaself

With all that rah rah rah, you're, playin' yaself
With all that big gun talk, bop, you're, playin' yaself
With all that Big Willie talk, hop, you're, playin' yaself
You're, playin' yaself, you're, playin' yaself

[Verse 2]
Now these ladies is looking pretty from city to city
I refined a few I met, around the country
The nitty gritty, it's all reality, no question
Actual fact like tight jeans cause yeast infections
And sisters with good minds, get no respect when
Their ass is all hanging out, playing the bar section
Of the club shake what your mama gave ya, back to the lab
I drop the truth, cause rhyming is more than just my craft
Or a way to get ass, or fast cash, or blasted
Black women, make sure you're respected
When niggas is kicking that old off the wall shit, let em know
From jump: "Dead it", you're not ignorant
Knowledge wisdom understanding is the key to wealth
Put some clothes on that ass if you respect yourself

[Hook]
With those hooker type wears hon you're, playin' yaself
With those skin tight jeans baby you're, playin' yaself
Everything all exposed you're, playin' yaself
You're, playin' yaself, you're, playin' yaself

Everything all exposed you're, playin' yaself
With those skin tight jeans baby you're, playin' yaself
With those hooker type wears hon you're, playin' yaself
You're, playin' yaself, you're, playin' yaself

[Verse 3]
Now, I don't bust a Tec, bubble drugs
In the projects, or use mics to sell sex
Niggas, nowadays is all about this
So much ying yang, it's ridiculous
If you got so much cheese where are the black distributors
And these record companies shake em down like mobsters
But impostors, like commercial locks are not rastas
Always faking moves, never, making moves
Asses shake, bottles pop, the government is breaking down you fools
You work all week and give the devil back his loot for jewels
And the steak on your plate is filled with chemicals
Still, brothers leave brothers all battered and bruised
On the streets, won't see snakes on my feet
The race is on, but I won't compete
In this competition, because I have a greater mission
I hope that you listen
Knowledge wisdom and understanding brings, long life
And health, think anything else and ya playin' yaself

[Hook]
So all that Big Willie talk, hop, you're, playin' yaself
And all those skin tight jeans hon you're playin' yaself
And all that rah rah rah, you're, playin' yaself
You're, playin' yaself, you're, playin' yaself

And all those hooker type wears baby you're playin' yaself
And all that big gun talk money you're playin' yaself
Everything all exposed you're, playin' yaself
You're, playin' yaself, you're, playin' yaself[Verse 1: Mad Lion]
Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why
Why does a DJ test and he end up die
I know, I know, I know, I can't explain
Pack up a shot just blow dem brain
Who are the man with the gun inna his hand
Step up on the scene like Captain Caveman
You want the music everybody scream louder
Lick bare shot and smell the gun powder

[Verse 2: Doug E. Fresh]
On and on and on and on...
Yo, freestyle flow to make the crowd just go
The old to the new, the new to the old
{Beatbox} The rhythm be working up on me
The crowd be jumping up for me, the people are waiting up on me
To enter the stage in the rage, Mad Lion's out the cage
Now it's time for me to engage, uhh
And bear witness, the lyrical fitness
The jumps, the dives, the leaps, are you getting this?
Next to step up, microphone check up
KRS-ONE, so come and get your wreck up

[Verse 3: KRS-ONE]
Our mother who art in Heaven number seven is the weapon
With the Goddess I'm stepping lyrically I'm never begging, you know
I'm the difference between indo and oregano
Imagine how fresh I am now, I made these lyrics up a year ago
So report back it was fat, fit, all that, quick, pump that, drop the S-hit
I'm lyrically physically fit
Catch me bugging on the mic, every day and every night
Every hour, every second, man it don't stop, get it, get it
Yes, admit it when I'm way up in it
You can't hide cause my radar's going bibip bibip bibip
I reside in the watchtower watching MCs land
Your career will be as short as my part in "Who's The Man"
Goddamn I'm the pinnacle, yes the metaphysical
Come to you as the rap god of lyrical syllables
Fall to your knees, bring fruit, ask advice
Put your rhymes on the altar, burn them as a sacrifice
The aroma reaches up to my nostril
I get hostile, your lyrics are stiff like David Koppel
Yes Premier rocks the track on time
KRS-ONE with off of the top of the head rhyme
Yeah Fat Joe, you know you got a flow
My man Doug E Fresh down with the one called KRS
We got the mad MCs up in the D&D
I'm out, G

[Verse 4: Fat Joe]
Yeah!
Motherfuckers know who's the best
If it ain't Fat Joe then it must be Lord Finesse
Think not, then show what you got
But don't grab this mic, the shit's too hot
I'm the born killer, nigga from the Bronx
Rappers talk shit but there's really no comp
Bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing
Yeah, so Smif-n-Wessun if you're down with me
Represent one time on the M-I-C

[Verse 5: Smif-n-Wessun]
Mr. Ripper, get your gear and prepare for war
Mr. Vickster, you ain't gotta tell me no more
Cause what I see, on the daily
Deals with reality, so come follow we on this journey
Through Brooklyn where the crooks dwell in the projects overlooking
In the form of the streets, you know them well
Bet your ass this grass is greener
Than a 20 sack of sensimila brought straight from Medina
You know the vibe when Smif-n-Wessun twist up the Thai
Peace to my people in the Ville, peace to my heads in the Stuy
We do or die, we test your stamina
So any challenger we pass the motherfucker off to the Damaja

[Verse 6: Jeru the Damaja]
Super scientifical madness
My status is the baddest every time I bless the apparatus
You wish to take me out, so you study
Meanwhile my clothes, mics and foes are left bloody
Cruddy, filthy from the ground on up
When I plan my attack I doubt that you're ready
Rain on competition like razor sharp confetti
Kung Fu techniques from the perverted monastery
Sifu Ru manipulates the microphone
And rhymes like bullets penetrate your zone
See we bring more drama than Kevin Costner
No I'm not Jamaican but yes I'm a RastaYou wanna front, what? Jump up and get bucked
The original, Dirty Rotten's fucking shit up
Empty your clip of lyrics in your chest and gut
All punks play the floor, it's raw and hardcore
Hotter than a meteor, scorching egos
Fake hoes, gangsters and super heroes
Cops pull me over like you under arrest
Some niggas I know act like bitches without breast
Dick riders, I hope you got your latex
Cause flesh gets burnt up during the process
DRS echoes through your projects
Met Billie Jean, had safe sex
Some MCs get caught up in the vortex
Mixing crack with cess, so they sold for fat checks
Listen to the words I manifest, the moment of truth have cats stressed
Every time you in the East they snatch the chain off your chest
Acting like you want some, but want none
Quick to make your finger like a gun, but faggots never bust none

[Hook]
99.9 Pa Cent of these niggas ain't shit
And most of these niggas suck dick
(Repeat x4)

Amateuristic martial arts is the number one cause of injury
Biters try to emulate my alchemy, get poisoned by the chemistry
99.9 percent of these niggas suck dick in the industry
Swords in my back, all for the benjies
I'm screaming off key, another body? No I'm back in 3D
Plus I can take the weight, I make the Earth rotate
Dick riders supply the gas, watch niggas head inflate
Wanting respect, but suspect hit the deck
This ain't just talk, Brooklyn East New York's on the set
Friendship vs. B.I. I keep my thoughts
Laser sharp jagged edges bust your third eye
Vessel of the most high, bullshit, they demand you supply
But don't get caught, the same nigga'll testify
Switch like a bitch
You not from East New York, you's a motherfucking snitch

[Hook]

Hip Hop Jim Kelly, leave the mic dead and smelly
Freak shows, flows and hoes back at the telly
Not your average nigga, gets more nasty than Dirk Diggler
I'm back like the night, swooping down on The Riddler
Fake thugs talk tough but ease off the trigger
So shook you shiver, poison verbs like alcohol destroy your liver
Make it volcanic hot, niggas got problems like Sir Smoke-a-Lot
Cannibals biting my dick, I need a tetanus shot
I'm the original, in cause your forgot
When it comes to war I get raw
Add another mic to the ones I rip, shooting the gift
When the East is in the house you should come equipped

[Hook]Verse One:
Now I don’t be foolin' around, I tell the truth. Nothing’s secret

As devils search for the secrets to immortality
I alter my physical chemistry
Walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I exist even when no things are left
Vibrations transcend space and time
Pure at heart because I deal with the mind
That's why I compose these verses
Audible worlds, my thoughts are now universes
Written on these pages is the ageless
Wisdom of the sages, ignorance is contagious
So I hope you keep your focus
There's no hocus-pocus, in the end, it's just us
Devil got brother killin brother, it's insane
Goin out like Abel and Cain
Wisen up and use your brain
There'll be no limit, to the things that you can gain
In positivity, balance it with negativity
Until then, ain't the devil happy

[Hook]
[Scratching in the RZA's famous laugh on the song "Tearz" by The Wu-Tang Clan]

Verse Two:

I hate when the devil's happy, so I wear my hair hair nappy
Knotty, won't go out like John Gotti
He came from the caves to destroy everybody
And we like fools destroy our own bodies
Too many niggas chillin, bad boys boom boom
This leaves no room for the flowers to bloom
Seeds blow in the wind, another drug killing
What, are we accomplishing? Nothing
What's, the matter?
Why everytime I look around another brain gets splattered?
Some pockets get fatter but it don't matter
The devil's the only one who really gets fatter
Lead ruptures flesh, spleens are shattered
Dreams are shattered, another Queen without a King
What will out children become without proper guidance?
Probably nothing, so ain't the devil happy

Verse Three:

Niggas are in a state of nothingness
Hopelessness, lifelessness
If you're in range I hope you hear this
And try to change this, cause it's disastrous
Who gets the most loot, who gets bust?
Dollar bill y'all, is the god we trust
THe days blow by like dust
Even Men of Steel rust
We're out here acting ridiculous
When, only we can save us
Mentally enslave us, for little or nothing kill our neighbors
Animalistic, caniballistic, behavior
Look to the sky for your savior
He won't save ya, he didn't save your forefathers
Why bother, brothers? You must discover
The power of self, know thyself, or find thyself
Hating thyself, killing thyself
While he collects the wealth that you sit back and murder for
Ain't the devil happyI met this honey named Yolanda
You would not believe the things that I told her
She had potential so I thought that I would mold her
(Break it down son)
You would usually see me and her around town
She had this way that was so sexy
Everytime I think about it-makes me woozy
And her rear end was just so nice and juicy
Plus a mind that you would not believe
No tricks up her sleeve
So we dated, like Janet Jackson, we waited
A while and waited and waited
I started to wonder would I ever get in it
Finally the invitation was extended
With that I said "Mi casa es su casa"
Meet me at my pad tomorow-about six o'clock
No question-the next day, we kissin' and caressin'
Before long, we starts to undress and
With that I pulls out my pack of hats
She looks me dead in the eye and says "What's that?"
I said "Don't tell me you don't know what condoms is for"
She says "Yeah, but the average nigga'll love to hit it raw"
And I said

I'm not your average nigga
No I'm not your average nigga
You can't get me, I'm not your average nigga

I'm not your average nigga
Girlfriend, I'm not your average nigga
No, no I'm not your average nigga

(Yo Ru! Yo these honeys be on some shit for real. Yo tell me about the
Other honey you was kickin' it to)

I met this honey named Tamika
My intentions was more than just to freak her
Since I'm gone I thought that I would teach her
(Where'd you meet her at, black?)
At The Tunnel so you know it didn't happen like that
I got her name and her number
I said "Girlfriend, I just wonder
Could you come home with me?" She said "Uh-uh
But you got the digits-ring me up tomorow and see where it leaves ya at
We started speakin'
We planned to hook up that next weekend
We discussed the place of our meeting
She said "Come to my projects
Sometimes niggas be buggin, but I got mad respect"
So like a dummy, I went to scoop up this young honey
Gassed up by the fat ass and flat tummy
But when I rolled up
It start to look just like a set-up
Now I'm mad hot, but this time played it cool
Recognized one nigga I used to run with in high school
I said "You know Tamika?" He said "Yeah I know the whore"
Got me to the elevator and led me to her door
When I rung the bell she was mad surprised
Flung the door wide open with a wild look in her eyes
I said, yo

I'm not your average nigga
You see, I'm not your average nigga
You can't get me cuz I'm not your average nigga

I'm not your average nigga
Girlfriend, I'm not your average nigga
Oh no, you know I'm not your average nigga

(scratch-"Chain nigga"-scratch-"here you comin' but your steps are to loud
Standing on the corner, thought him was cool"-scratch-"chain nigga"

I met this honey named Sabrina
I thought that this time this one would be the Queen of
My dreams, but you know how that goes
(God, I heard it before)
So let me tell you what happened one day I'm outside her door
And we're talking about how her ex-boyfriend be stalking
She said she thought she saw him when we were walking
I said "Don't worry about it
Put that shit on the side, and slide up in the crib"
So we're lampin', she's still shook up about what happened
I said "Don't sweat it, he's probably just rappin'"
She said "Little do you know
Last week he threw a brick threw my bedroom window"
I said "Whatever, I don't think he's that crazy"
She said "You never, know where he may be"
All of a sudden, out of nowhere
The crazy mothafucka jumped out on me
I made him melt with a blow to the head
And before I bounced, this is what I said
I said

Yo I'm not your average nigga
No, I'm not your average nigga
You can't get me cuz I'm not your average nigga

Mista, I'm not your average nigga
No, I'm not your average nigga
Oh no, you know, I'm not your average nigga[Verse 1]
I heard some MC's wanna bring it
But a female is one of their strongest men
When I step to you don't seek refuge
Make it happen, fuck the rappin'
Because I know I got that sewed
The first time I ever touched the microphone it glowed
Now I explode, eruptin' like a nigga that drunk too much
But not intoxicated...
As mental stress increase you'll need to be sedated
Sick and tired of the izm schism
This time's a warning, after this we take it to pugilism
Mash out the beedies, dreads spark up the corn
I flow muddy like the gutter after the rainstorm
My mission to seek, build or destroy
Like Deadwood Dick, I be the Black Cowboy
And this is the showdown...

[Scratched Hook]
(I got the wild style...)
(Black Cowboy)

[Verse 2]
After this MC's will wish to do battle with me
For their sake I hope that they apply the proper strategy
In any case, worst comes to worst I'll be the best
Storms will come, this we know for sure, but can you stand the crash test?
There's no vest or no way you can get suited up
For what's about to happen, you might as well get zooted
I heard that ignorance is bliss, so I guess you're all blistered
The wrong move is made, like 40's in the ghetto your cap is quickly twisted
And just in case the first time you missed it
The wrong move is made, like 40's in the ghetto your cap is quickly twisted
Livin' on a diet of flesh and Mistic
I kicks the ballistics and keep it realistic
We shoot shit up like the Hatfields and McCoys
Perverted monks, the Black Cowboys
And this is the showdown...

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
It's a cryin' shame what some niggas'll do for fame
When they think they know the game
But I switch up the rules of the game
Drops jewels in the game
The fluid is quite fatal, like water on the brain
I be the Sheriff and I got MC's on the chain gang
Continuous hard labour until the day that they hang
One outlaw tried to escape but I murdered his gang
Right back at ya bitch-ass just like a boomerang
Or a bolo, you couldn't knock me out with Apollo
The god is never chillin', hot like a volcano
Once I met up with this bandolero
Why'd he make me bust him in his head with his banjo?
I put MC's on the ceiling like Michelangelo
Did the Sistine Chapel
Known to kick and grapple, so you couldn't test the Real McCoy
The Black Cowboys
And this is the showdown...

[Hook](Ah check it out...check it out yo) (Repeat 4x)

Here's the remedy, for all your cornball raps
Brooklyn's back on the map, I'm not bragging
Defeating all foes, bring your styles
I stomp out the last dragon
Grand groove, Grandmaster, like back in the days
Holding my own, on the street and the microphone
You can't rip it, I grip it, and flip it
Trip it down memory lane, back to the park jams
We used to spark jams, now niggas get jammed
Or should I say jelly?
My vocals rip through your Pelle Pelle
You can't see me so you can't hit me
You ace deuce tre, I four five six and trips
Drums numb your ears, rhymes swell up your lips
Chicks gravitate towards the crooked
If your props are gone, Brooklyn took it

Chorus:
("Brooklyn keeps on taking it" - KRS) (Repeat 4x)

Mindcrusher, spinecrusher, Brooklyn been banging
Making noise from the US to Russia
Couldn't set it, even if you wanted
So many bodies on my microphone, the shit's haunted
Doggonnit, your girl's on it
Record companies are on it, you can't have it, causing havoc
Building, destroying, deploying
My rhymes on beats strategicly I melt any MC
I repre- aww fuck it, don't even need to say it
You know the time when I start to sautee it
So niggas be having mad maws and shit
Cause Brooklyn stole the show like a grand larcenist
But ease up off us, or you'll need officers
We're deadly, there's no cure
Boom bang em on down, treat competition like clowns
Crooklyn, Crooklyn, from town to town
Serve your girl butt naked
If she's gone, who took it?

Chorus

This one is for Brooklyn, land of crooks, home of my game
Try to front and we retire, MC's set em all on fire
Scooping up the fly ladies round my microphone like a Mercedes
The eighties. If I was a video game you couldn't play me
So keep it moving, don't play yourself
Your rhymes are semi-baffling, mine quite graffing
Switch up, change up, Brooklyn still gets biz
Plop plop, fizz fizz like Alka-Seltzer
Try to freak it, wind up in a homeless shelter
Cause fuck what you heard, this is Crooklyn's casa
Try to see us, and it's an MC massacre
When we step, your state we shook it
If it's gone, no doubt, Brooklyn took it

Chorus[Produced by DJ Premier]

[Verse 1]
You wanna front, what, jump up and get bucked
If you're feeling lucky duck then press your luck
I snatch fake gangster MCs and make 'em faggot flambé
Your nine spray, my mind spray
Malignant mist that'll leave Kant defunkt
The result's your remains stuffed in a car trunk
You couldn't come to the jungles of the East popping that yang
You won't survive get live catching wreck is our thing
I don't gang bang or shoot out bang bang
The relentless lyrics the only dope I slang
I'm a true master you can check my credentials
Cause I choose to use my infinite potential
Got a freaky, freaky, freaky freaky flow
Control the mic like Fidel Castro locked Cuba
So deep that you can't scuba dive
My jive's origin is unknown like the Jubas
I've accumulated honeys all across the map
Cause I'd rather bust a nut than bust a cap
In your back in fact my rap snaps your sacroilliac
I'm the mack so I don't need to tote a Mac
My attack is purely mental and its nature's not hate
It's meant to wake ya up out of your brainwashed state
Stagnate nonsense, for if you persist
You'll get your snotbox bust you press up on this
I flip, hoes dip, none of the real niggas skip
You don't know enough math to count the mics that I've ripped
Peep the Dirty Rotten scamp as his verbal weapons spit

[Hook]
Oh-oh! Heads up cause we're dropping some shit!
(Scratched x4)

[Verse 2]
Real, rough and rugged, shine like a gold nugget
Every time I pick up the microphone I drug it
Unplug it on chumps with the gangster babble
Leave your nines at home and bring your skills to the battle
You're rattling on and on and ain't saying nothing
That's why you got snuffed when you bumped heads with Dirty Rotten
Have you forgotten, I'll tap your jaw
I also kick like kung fu flicks by Run Run Shaw
Made frauds bleed every time I g'd
Cause I've perfected my drunken style like Sam Seed
Pseudo psychos, I play like Michael Jackson
When I'm busting ass and breaking backs
Inhale the putrified aroma
Breathe too deep and you'll wind up coma
Toast the king I'm hard like a fifth of vodka
And bring your clique cause I'm a hard rock knocker
I gotcha out on a limb about to push you off the plank
Let you draw your chronz but your burner shot blanks
When the East is in the house you should come equipped

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Fly like a jet, sting like a hornet
Knuckleheads get live and set it off if you want it
Dirty Rotten Scoundrels is crushing fools no joke
With styles more fatal than second hand smoke
Don't provoke the wrath of this rhyme inventor
Cause I blow up spots like the World Trade Center
Come with the super trooper on his assault mission
The tek's technique cause he's a technician
Wishing he'll go away won't help the weapons stop
The skills are shot cause any idiot can let off a Glock
Hard rocks melt in the clutch of the sun toucher
You claim you got beef on the streets, so what ya
Gonna do when real niggas roll up on you
And you don't got your crew
Pull your Glock but you don't got the heart
You was webbed straight from the start
Bought a tool and didn't learn how to use it
Got lost in Brooklyn so you had to lose it
Just for fronting you got that ass whipped

[Hook x3][Hook]
I'm not talking about the queens
But [what?] the bitches
Not the sisters [what?] the bitches
Not the young ladies [what?] the bitches
The bitches, the bitches
[Bitch!]

Now a queen's a queen and a stunt is a stunt
You can tell who's who by the things they want

Most chicks want minks
Diamonds, a Benz
Spend up all your ends
Prob'bly fuck your friends

High-post attitudes, real rude with fat asses
Think that the pussy is made out of gold
Try to control you by slidin' up and down on the wood
They be givin' up sex for goods

Dealin' with bitches is the same old song
They only want you 'til someone richer comes along

Don't get me wrong, strong black women
I know who's who so due respect I'm givin'

While queens stand by you, and stick around
Bitches suck you dry and push you down
So it's my duty to address
This vampiress
Givin' the black man stress
Recognize what's real and not material
Or burn in hell, chasin' Polo and Guess, dumb bitches

[Hook]

My man had a chick an' thought she was finger-lickin'
I knew her style that's why I'm vegetarian
I told him she was out to get what she could get
He didn't believe me, so she bagged him up in the end
Made the pussy do tricks then she sucked his dick
He got caught up in the grip now he's payin' the rent

Black Widow: she even killed dead presidents
That he'd owe. Shouldn't have got one red cent
I body slam her But I'm not a misogynist
When I see a brother gettin' nabbed it makes me pissed

Cosmetic enchantress scandalous temptress
The way my man went out you'd think she was a pimpstress

Bitches come my way, I make 'em hop
Cause I'm hip to the game
I'm not a slave so I don't get pussy-whipped
Bear in mind you'll lose em' to end material riches
Fuckin' around with those bitches

[Hook]

Since I've been club-hoppin'
You've been ho-hoppin'
You've seen them pop up in every spot that I'm in

Any nigga with a record
Could get your butt naked

So your man got a Lexus
You live in the projects
Tryin' a flex but you ain't the smartest
Your ass ain't the fattest
Fuck around, play yourself and get dissed
I know your status, you can't touch my status
Deep down you want this
Dyin' a be famous but you can't attain this

Poppin' that coochie for Gucci
Bitches like you ain't shit to me
And don't talk about R-E-S-P-E-C-T
Cause I treat my black sisters like royalty

Now go in peace Don't make me get raw
And treat you like the harlot that you are
Filthy bitches[Verse 1]
Dirty rotten scoundrel, that's what I'm called, on the street
Could connive and cheat but rarely get beat
Ya see I'm streetwise, a con-game pro
Kickin the Bobby bullshit, too smart for Willie Bobo
Not stressin five-o, hot hand in cee-lo
Live in the land of crooks yes Brooklyn's the borough
Homicide central, East New York
Where the manic, depressive psycho murderers stalk
Walk, like a ninja, on the asphalt
Here talk is cheap, you're outlined in chalk
And there's more hardtimes, than on Good Times
And most niggas dedicate their life to crime
So I'm steady schemin, won't work for a dime
Used to get, tax free loot, all the time
Type slick can't fess on 'Ru, because
I'm the original dirty rotten scoundrel

[Verse 2]
Before trains were graffiti proof I used to get loose
Dirty rotten since the days of the deuce
Dirty, because of the skin I'm in
The fact I have melanin automatically makes me a felon
Even though I'm righteous, rotten's what you're yellin
But I'm not chain-snatchin, or drug-sellin
According to your books you said I would be damned like Ham
Scoundrel opposite of the king that I am
But wanna get funny, we can get bummy
Take you to the East and back again money
Filthy putrified trick, step past your sister
Challenge the Damaja, and you'll be histo - ry
Mortal Kombat fatality, the original don't sing no R&B
Nasty MC deity
Chop off domes with the poems that come out of my pin-eal
Gland, as I expand, you know who I am

[Verse 3]
Father of all stylin, I be whylin on wax
We hack shit up like big ax and little ax
Don't need tokes to make you jump like bungee
Tracks real muddy, like Brooklyn's real grungy
When I come through I clog up your sewer
Peep the maneuveur, drop the ill manure
So bring Mr. Clean, Drano, and Roto Rooter
No matter what you do, you can't get through the
Crud that comes out of your system
You're another victim, of dirty rotten
Dirt up, in your grill, so what ya gonna do
But pay homage to...*Forest Whitaker reading*

[Jeru]
Samurai linguist, others suck like ?Cunnylingus?
I burn shit up like a poison penis
Make your whole style seem meaningless
Match wits wit this
Call your squad the hole of Fortress
I swoop down like a dirty Brooklyn pigeon
Swing my sword wit precision
Lightning speed blurs your vision
Like a surgeon wit razor sharp incision
Subconcious like hypnotism
Water on the brain, the mental baptism
Put your aura in prison
Block up your chi, and bend your light like a prism

[Afu-Ra]
Yeah, ghost walkin the dog stand personified
Study lessons and plant seeds to fertilize
Straight up, I slaughter the ? that's got the order
Spit flyin straight at my mouth is holy water
I damage flows, on the mics crushin your matter
And saw you scatter, and couldn't put you back together
Fist of ten rings, I'm scrapin Jews up out the gutter
Hittin ya, splittin ya floss like Forest Whitaker
Sick wit the, get wit the thoughts next to K.I.M
With the utmost, you want lyrics, here's an overdose
Preverb'll Taoist, styles you'll be a ghost
I did it a lot, I been in the spot, I rip it alot
And now some motherfuckas wanna try to scheme and plot
And takin chances in life like throwin dice
It's Afu-Ra, I return from death twice
You talkin bout skills? Yeah yeah, I'm twice as nice
Take it to the apex, and push it high-tech
These petty MC's, they picture-paintin hot sex
I melt tracks, I bomb sets wit hot wax
You want some spiritual syllables wit the chemicals
Murdered down eighty-five percent subliminal
Ten percent, fire burn em wit my visual
Five percent, we break bread all in the mental
I keep it comin like rotisserie, and missin me
Straight up and down, I let you know I do it wickedly

*Vocal sample*

Chorus [Jeru] 3x
It's the Code of the Samurai, prepare to die
Know you'll die, Brooklyn E-N-Y

It's the Code of the Samurai...[Intro]
(scratching)
It's the ol'-sama
Of the Commie-sama
With the Ichiban DJ
King of the Iron Fist
We nasty at this

[Jeru]
Jeru the Damaja, DJ Honda, unorthodox
Off beat style, Musashi style
Lyrical swordplay
And it goes like this, check it

[Verse One]
Black Castro up on me, Fidel Negro
King terrific can't be hit
You're wastin' time, spendin' ammo
Scientists balance pol-ar
Digital mic-ro chips in your mo-lar
Hardcore nucle-ar
Ain't the devil happy? Har-har
Rich rap star keep the sol-ar manifestation
And the stars succeed to the sun in this mathematical equation
Police still on my dick like an invasion
Lock me up, snatch up the transportation
Winter in New York, South Pacific migration
Wack emcee's watch this nigga's frustration
Believe me when I tell you that I dictate the mic like Fidel does his nation
Keep it flowin' like libation
Big heads the perfect target for decapitation
Cook rhymes 'till they al dente
Lock down the mic like El Presidente

[Hook]
(scratches by DJ Honda)
+Rule the mic like Fidel Castro+

[Verse Two]
Conquer more dips than the late Hannibal
Terrain gets too rough, I ride the beats like wooly mammals
Smokin' shit like Joe Camel
Fatally inhale
Double-0-seven but you still got tail
Q's scrambling device must have failed
Spies, thick thighs, and mics get mil, lies
Deception, military prowess
Fat bitches, tours, and microphone powers
Chemical warfare and mortar showers
Once again blowin' up shit like the Twin Towers
Poison rhymes for enemies or whoever devours
Holdin' shit down until the last hours

[Hook]
(scratches by DJ Honda)
+Rule the mic like Fidel Castro+

El Presidente
Fidel Negro
DJ Honda
Black Castro
Musashi be doin' it like that
Lyrical sword style, you know what I'm sayin'?
Puttin' all emcees out on they back
Can't handle it
You don't know it hits you 'till it hits you
That's it
We done, finished

Fejki chcą uzdrowić rap, choć reprezentują ściemę

Lecimy z tym tematem, zatem nie ma na co czekać
To Full Time Job - robota na cały etat
Ekipa w chuj, [?] daje konkretny przekaz
O tym jak zdobyć coś, zamiast wiecznie narzekać
Jeśli chcesz robić sos musisz być po prostu dobry
Poświęcać temu czas, nawet ten od pracy wolny
Jeżeli talent masz, wykorzystaj go, bądź mądry
I gdy na sto procent grasz, możesz być o cel spokojny
Niejeden zjebał szansę, chociaż był naprawdę zdolny
Ty nie bądź oporny, pysku, nie zwlekaj zbyt długo
Bo pamiętaj, że nie łatwo jest otrzymać szansę drugą
A wokół mnóstwo pokus, one niestabilnych gubią
Jeśli chcesz dotrzymać kroku musisz zapierdalać grubo
Od świtu aż do zmroku, pierdolić co inni mówią
Bez kitu, ziom, bez ciołków, przed siebie nakurwiaj z dumą

Ile bezsennych nocy, szlifowania stylu, bracie
Full Time Job, nie każdy jest w temacie
Siedzę sam na chacie, wiem, jak się skupię to rozkurwię, tej
Play, poczuj tę moc, weź milcz
Skurwysynu, zejdź z drogi tym, którzy serce wpierdalają w to od zawsze
Chłopak z sąsiedztwa na pełen etat, suko, znasz mnie[Man]
Go out into the field and rap to these people

[Ladybug]
I got the concrete under my feet
I got shotty right next to my body

I got the ease back style, watch out what i'm typin

[All]
Noise, noise, noise, noise (x4)

[Ladybug]
To summarize a lick at the man with the stick
Come strategy fight act like new york
Pieces can squeeze deep of the way
Why g mayors sonnies dis it
We latitude sway we determine the prey
He swings the whole sphere in original
Scare steelo's weak soul scream and a whisper
Blow the house right over black people grow

[Butterfly]
We make

[All]
Noise, noise, noise, noise (x2)

[Jeru]
I got the buck wild style that make you get hyper
I got the knowledge of god, sevens all in my cipher
I got the new york hip hop so it goes on and on
Lose my mind, pen and paper then the rhymes is not
Mind held down well so you can't touch it
When i discharge fools pray for peace
Beats all on my back it's just like that in brooklyn
So i vibrate and shake em off like fleas
Electromatic radiation, radio waves
Changing frequency
Here in n.y.c we get busy
Raps and peas, street smarts, no college degrees
Too many degrees the freeze not fakin
Fake snakes are bacon, honeys hips are shakin
It ain't no joke so get your boys

[Man]
This i full rule what we do

[Jeru]
We make

[All]
Noise, noise, noise, noise (x2)

[Butterfly]
I got the power for twenty four hours
I got the love pump, brooklyn don't front
I got the fly joints pat, like that, like that
I got the slow motion got my float, got my clique

[Doodlebug]
I get sly when i feel the positive vibe, uh
The seven gets eleven when i'm filled with the vibes
Now i'm flyin high through the seventh dimension
As i travel uptown to get a piece of the action
Then i'm maxin with the actual facts men
As we relax to a black ceaser flick and third vision
My movements is precision, supreme mathematician
Indeed i'm true and livin when i'm givin

[Ladybug]
What?

(Doodlebug)
That

[All]
Noise, noise, noise, noise (x4)

[Butterfly]
Brothers with the blowouts develop your envelopes
Stamp it, amp it, raise your razor blade
Found downtown in the land of crooks
My pops say books, i say sneaks and name buckles
Pigs say freeze boy, shit, i just chuckles
Fence alley
Walkin by them fronts from my jip in the flatty
Everthing cherry cause george just stole a caddy
Who bust dex was the question next
Dre said

[Dre]
Northbound

[Butterfly]
Then he sipped his becks
Then he clipped his vex, display the context
Beep code, street clothes and all the nose candy
Hotter microphone, heater the chrome jammy
My family consists one honey
Comrades, ghetto streets, more gods than greeks
The seven twos eleven till death toy
Now you understand what i'm talking about
Now you understand what my walk is about
Now you understand what new york is about
We make

[All]
Noise, noise, noise, noise

[Butterfly]
It's just

[All]
Noise, noise, noise, noise (x4)

[Sample]
They keep lying together like fingers on the can
No outsiders ever, neverWhat niggas do in they last 24, I did in the first
Before the doctor cleaned off the afterbirth
I kicked a verse, smoked a blunt, shooked the Earth
Smacked the physician, and fucked the nurse
The truth hurts, like a sword in the hand of this expert
Cuttin through your soul, like your best friend did your dirt
Mental like physical blows destroy ego's
Your style is Babylonian, like dicks in assholes
The drama unfolds, don't mean nothing up my nose
I can't stand snow, it only blows like nitro
Blistering, my flows I'm splittin, so I hope you listening
Super shoutout to all my niggas in prison
Shout to the pyramids, the cypher and scription
Science fact not fiction, I cut with precision
Speak multiplication, subration, addition
Division, Great Solar Stance burns compition

"This-this-this-this is the Showdown"

I put you in the chicken wing like Bob Backlund
Jack ya team captain
Bring drama like summer night, ghetto action
Some honies got it twisted, fat asses I mash 'em
Cops like jewels, back in the days I snatch 'em
You catch a tantrem, date how the raws rockin the drum
Float like the white lotus, kill like Whitey in Vietnam
You should peel arm, gorilla tactics like Viacom
Set shit on fire like a bong, up in smoke like Cheech & Chong
True blacks too strong can't let nothin stand in my way
Shit will get thick like Juice 60 in Friday
In Brooklyn, kill MC's like Captain Hook your children
To rappers I'm a villain, fill esteem wan't my secret like Samson
Picture so hard, I stunt your grandson son
Teleport from Coast To Coast like Spaceghost
Like soy butter on my breakfast toast
And when It comes to makin it nasty, I flips it the most

"This-this-this-this-this is the Showdown"
"This-this-this-this-this is the Showdown"

Setting it off like pistols in the projects
The climax hold ya six like nasty hot wet sex
But string tech I catch wreck, ejucalate when I inject
Not a player hatter, regulator, trick niggas get checked
When I resurrect hip hop, you know the bullshit stop
Like you got the oo-wop, the pops and what nots
Fruity like Ed Koch, ya straight boo-tops, I'm top notch
Super funky like a derelict prostitute prop
Ya hear gun shots, the coroner shows up to take flicks
Shit is feet, but no feet shit like chicks with dicks
Ya throat flip too quick, to blaze magnetic
Paramedics roll up on the scene
It's tragic, don't deal with Magic
Johnson, renegade like Charles Bronson
Packing a force like 18 Bronzemen
Grand larson, excelent marksmen arson
Fire, water, earth, metal, wind[Verse 1: Lil Dap]
Twenty-four / seven, three-sixty-five
Rap is real, how many can stay alive
7:30 with the rhymes, watch the time
Like a black-and-white TV watch these rhymes
So ahead of my time, watch these lines
He’s so amazing when he rhymes
Had to deal with this and get with that
Even though they hate me your boy still came back

[Hook 2X: Lil Dap]
Tell me what would you do if it was you?
Would you pop off and rock with ya crew?
What would you do if it was you?
Would you pop off and rock with ya crew?

[Verse 2: Lil Dap]
I lost my big brother this year and that's a fact
Had to come back and hit you with the latest facts
Man it hurt me so much man I had to sit back
Pray to God hoping that you will come back
But as your mission is done so you gotta go now
So let's pray that you go to a better place now
No more jealousy and envy hurting you now
No more fake niggas just hanging around
I remember when we used to dig a tunnel down
Going to far countries and give them the sound
Breaking two inch tapes to give them the taste
Of this real hip hop boy I could not wait, uh...
Boy, still came back

[Hook 2X: Lil Dap]
Tell me what would you do if it was you?
Would you pop off and rock with ya crew?
What would you do if it was you?
Would you pop off and rock with ya crew?

[Verse 3: Melachi the Nutcracker]
It seems like just since the day we’ve been "So-Called Friends"
Now Guru is watching in 2010
Me and Dap, niggas filled with frustration
Guru put us down with the Gang Starr Foundation
We held each other down, no one stood alone
Dap came up with the name yo we are the Group Home
We became "Superstars", now we’re "Livin' Proof"
You know that this is the "Moment of the Truth"

[Verse 3: Jeru The Damaja]
People know about the world wide tours
While we used to steal food and sleep on your floors
You took care of me you's my brother from another mother
You're always in my heart and mind, Guru I love ya
All the things that we’ve been through
Me and Dap remain cool no matter what other niggas do
I'm watching Tim we used to spit rhymes
Drink 40’s all night, those were some real good times
Me, you and Dap used to combine minds
A couple of times we even helped you with a couple of lines
Late night sessions at Firehouse
Dap gets fucked up stabbed the couch we at the powerhouse
I won't forget the things I was taught
It's because of you dude that I'm on my 5th passport
Rocking shows around the world
Bad chicks in every port, not spending time in the penal court
Your life on earth was way to short
In the end I wish I was there to be in support
If I knew then what I knew now, it would be a whole different story
At least you would have died around your whole army
Thanks for the fun, the fame and the glory
Son you know what it is
I know you're riding crowds "Above the Clouds"
So give a shout out to big for me, peace

[Hook 2X: Lil Dap]
Tell me what would you do if it was you?
Would you pop off and rock with ya crew?
What would you do if it was you?
Would you pop off and rock with ya crew?Skills? Skills?
Listen, I got crazy skills
I’ma tell you like this
I’m so ill I snatch the food out the hungry lion’s mouth
Jog from Brooklyn to DC on I 95 south
Without getting fatigued I travel at light speed
Get shot with a bazooka, dog can barely bleed
I can touch a lightning bolt, and not get shocked
Put shots at the president and won’t get knocked no shittin’
Swim with the sharks and I ain’t never been bitten
Have Nelson Mandela quoting the shit that I’m spitting
Make one phone call I get pulled me apart
And another call I kick it with Osama Bin Laden
Have every lesbian chick, begging for dick
Make that nigga Al Sharpton cut off that old perm shit
Spit fire out my mouth like the mythical dragon
Own a unicorn horn; smoke the blunt with the leprechaun
Squash ghetto beef before the weapons are drawn
Bring lash back to life and put his black ass on
To get this ill takes practice
Nasty
I’m so ill I have mike Bloomberg cutting me checks
Pimps instruct they hoes to pay me for sex
I make extra chips teaching David Blaine tricks
NASA called my lab before they launch rocket ships
So ill, Jackie Chan calls me the black version
After finished rapping I’ma be a brain surgeon
I can see the planets clearly without a telescope
Went to Rome to rock so they try to make me the Pope
I have Oprah in the crib posing for exotic flicks
Take a trip to Fort Knox and pick up like 80 bricks
Free all of the wrongfully imprisoned people out of jail
And when I’m finished with Oprah ill snap flicks of Gail
Ill rip the mic all night without taking a breath
Swim the Atlantic Ocean without taking a rest
Or getting wet
I always win so gamblers place your bets
I’m taking MC’s to Maury for maternity tests
To get this Ill takes practice
And it goes like this
I’m so ill they model computer chips after my brain
When a county in drought they call the kids for rain
Bring peace to the Gaza strip cause I got so much clout
Mario owe me dough for knocking Donkey Kong out
Wolfgang Puck gave me paper to teach me to cook
JK Rowlings asked me to write the next harry potter book
I can feed a million people with my peacea and jada
Darth Vader don’t really know I’m Luke Skywalker father
I spend my down time writing scripts for Scorsese
When I blow shit up I make the terrorists hate me
I’ma probably end up living until I’m one hundred and eighty
My stamina so legendary, wonder women trying to date me
My touch cures the sick, like an antibiotic
Slap up Steve Austin, and short out his bionics
Rap to a point just like a navy seal gunner
I’m taking shit over this summer and every summer
To get this Ill takes practice..I got a freaky freaky freak, give you a freak you turns em out
I put them hoes in a row and turn out Queens no doubt
Don't need a vest, but flow like bullets freely through shootouts
I be the real supernatural, so check it out
I was concieved in the center of an inferno
The ninth month I slipped out my mom's vaginal
Cavity, now I'm surrounded by creeps and freaks
Had to watch my back in the New York streets
Fly, like an aeroplane, more powerful than the engine of an A train
Won't stress my brain
You know the fame that has men sold and bought
In a single bound, I let the criminal court
Walk through the desert and don't perspire
Touch the microphone, the whole joint catches afire
Use the opportunity to call the devil a liar
And I won't stop flipping shit til I'm forced to retire
Because that's how I'm living

I can stroke all night and not bust a nut
Swim through a sea of razorblades and not get cut
When I do my thing I aim for the gut
And despise those nasty guys that hit shit in the butt
Blaze like spliffs even back in the days
When I bag shit up like trays, nowadays
I bag 'em up like dimes and not even the Devil
Can stop me cause it's matter under mind
I'm fucking up your mind like a hallucinogen
(Are you hot, Lord?) I heat it up like halogen
Burn MC's, their children, and their children's children
Reverse polarity and make your girl's hell heaven
More intelligent than MacGuyver
Quick to pull off on a stunt like an Indy car driver
Thoughts too intense, brainwaves cut like barbed wire
Since Run's a reverend, sucker MC's call me sire
Push for my mental forces to crush your fortress
Signals of stress, your whole squad's put to death
Bring your white Superman and I'll rip that fucking S off his chest
Cause that's just how I'm living

I dedicate my life to taking snake heads
I break on the beats like scissors break on my dreads
Instead of eating beasts and living savagely
I aspire to excell to the highest degree
Of living, now how you living, like a turkey on Thanksgiving
Me? I keep it tight and lock it down like a virgin's pops
]From crack rocks to suburbian spots I'm hot
Don't forget or have you forgot that I'm a surgeon, Ak-
Bar, once outran a jaguar
Slept in a lion's den and escaped without a scar
Close my eyes and comence the star travel
Fred Flintstone's out a job because I turn hard rocks to gravel
Babble, never, control the weather
Like a few jams back, whatever's, clever
Even the rudest of rude can't test because I'm protectes
With the Breastplate of Righteousness
And that's just how I'm livingVerse One:

Police all on my dick like I shot somebody
Cause of these big ass lips and I rock my locks knotty
Life is getting hectic 2Pac got shot in the nuts
You saw cops was corrupt when Rodney King got fucked up
With friends like these who needs enemies
Constantly harassing, feeling up my nuts like a Klansman
Snatching up a nigga for nuttin I heard bad guys wear black
So I guess I'm the motherfucking villain
Under pressure they got me under pressure
What's your name your address and phone number
Your occupation come down to the station
There's been a robbery they claim a nigga fit the description
It can't be, so I slides out on em
In ninety-five you gotta catch a nigga, if you want him
One to three, and five to ten
Bullies in blue suits Son with automatic weapons
I'm stressed, ready to blow up somethin
The beast keep frontin, invasion

Verse Two:

I was forced into a life of crime
Career criminal, now my career is crime
My mind is in a fucked up state
A brainwashed state, is the black man's fate, in the ground
Or locked down upstate, when I was young I used to shoot for the stars
But got shot down by demons in patrol cars
Stars good cop, bad cop, stick up the crack spot
The ave won't get hot til one of their crew gets shot
Ask, Larry Davis, how much they took
Cops and crooks, but who's the crooks?
Take a nigga to jail, make bail, guilty or innocent
The system gets ten percent
Frontin like you're doin somethin
But you ain't sayin nothin, invasion

Verse Three:

Come up in my cipher best believe I'mma dip on that ass
Beast-boy I'm professional heart of the ghetto
Raised, in the ways of thugs
Dodgin slugs, takin slugs, driving stolen automobiles
Skills fantastical
Living life on the edge it's dramatic, mad drama
I'm a fanatic, adrenalin addict
Getaway car, stick shift or automatic
Where's my crew at, you got your crew scopin
For a nigga up and down the Ave, it makes me laugh
Eat my nuts, eat my dust
I won't spend the night locked up or in handcuffs
Cuz in the concrete jungle, I got the right stuff
Smooth operator, pilot and navigator
Break out from oppression, my mission to escape
The, invasion[Verse 1]
It started on the sands of land of the mother
Word to mother, king like my father
My style survived slave ships, whips, and chains, hardships
Still through all
This the praise roll off my lips
Bring your guns, chains and tongue force your religion
On me cut my hair, the vibes still exist
To destroy the molesters of my heritage
But they conceal the drums reveal, my royal lineage
King of kings, God of
Gods
Like my ancestors drums I beat the odds
More mics killed than slaves during the middle passages
Who rapes and ravages and calls us savage?
Jungle bunny, I'm not mo' funny, I'm mo' deadly
They know one day we'll learn how to use it
That's why they fear our jungle
Music

[Hook: Preemo on the cuts]
"In the J-U-N-G-L-E"

[Verse 2]
We went from pyramids to the ghetto
Still my sounds make devils tumble like the walls of Jericho
Chant my power to devour all the snakes and rats
Extrasensory perception to avoid all traps
Make a joyful noise unto the Lord
In the sancuary of your caves white kids press record
As my mystic music spread from sea to galaxy
It's inevitable, you can't stop me
Try an' carbon copy, but it always comes out sloppy
You can't outrap me, you can't outrock me
Like the dreads on my head, you try and lock me
Down underground, but I bounce to the jungle
Melodies, that flows like the breeze
Through the trees, like my forefathers, command the wind and seas
With my jungle music

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Unga bunga binga
Sound warrior, I'll take your head more than a rap singer
Enlightener, with the mitre
Make the forces of my nature smite ya
Over the airwaves, powers are released
Holy music destroy the savage beast
I'll beat the devil like a Nyahbinghi drummer
Beats his drum, this beat will drum through the summer
Try to hold us back with all the strength you can muster
You'll hear a sound similar to the one Custer
Heard before he got ambushed, you'll get ambushed
For taking this back to Kush
For too long you've abused it
On the low used it, and called it jungle music

[Hook][Jeru]
I apologize to all persons that I have hurt in the past

[Hook]
I'm sorry, so sorry
I'm sorry, so sorry
Please accept my apology

[Jeru]
Damn son, you getting tight? I ain't mean it, it was a joke, damn
You..you.. you can't take a joke? C'mon man. You know what?

[Verse One]
I'm sorry I ain't the hero that you need in your life
I'm sorry but sometimes I tend to live trife
I'm sorry I can't say what you want me to say
I'm sorry I'm bound to flip up on any given day
I'm sorry y'all seem conceeded but I know my shit's fly
I'm sorry I lost my temper and punched you in the eye
I'm sorry I can't live up to your expectations
I'm sorry if how I move causes you frustration
I'm sorry that a brother have all type of hang ups
I'm sorry I quit smoking cause now I drink too much
I'm sorry I make mistakes that I can't take back
Like busting guns and selling crack
I'm sorry to all the cats that I hit in the head
I'm sorry I get violent when I get real fed
I'm sorry I couldn't be a better friend
But I do the right thing if I could do it again
I'm sorry I couldn't be there when you needed help
I'm sorry but I was busy tryin' to help myself
I'm sorry, that life is filled with all type of hard knocks
But if you can't handle it, then, kick rocks

[Hook]
I'm sorry, so sorry
I'm sorry, so sorry

[Verse Two]
I'm sorry if you think that I'm a dirty such & such
I'm sorry I got a big mouth and talk too much
I'm sorry my first album couldn't save the world
And if at any point in life, I hit your girl
I'm sorry if sometimes I'm contradictory
I'm sorry MCs try hard but they can't see me
I'm sorry I don't work with your favourite producer
I'm sorry I can't quit cause I'm not a loser
I'm sorry but I have to walk with my head high
I'm sorry my mind state is not just getting by
I'm sorry for things I said cause I know I offend
I'm sorry but I call it like I see it my friend
I'm sorry if we met and you thought I was rude
But I make it a habit not to hang with dudes
I'm sorry if I generically signed you autograph
I'm sorry if you feel I ain't bring the heat since the Wrath
I'm sorry if I ignored you tryin' to spit to some chick
I'm sorry but sometimes I think with my dick
I'm sorry for knowing the godly but dealing with earth
This is a formal apology for what it's worth
I'm sorry but life is filled with all type of hard knocks
And if you can't handle it, pssst, kick rocks

[Hook]
I'm sorry, so sorry
I'm sorry, so sorry
Please accept my apology

[Jeru]
Is that good enough? You feel better now? Listen...

[Verse three]
I'm sorry I'm not the man that you want me to be
I'm sorry I don't understand you and you can't understand me
I'm sorry for all the feelings that I hurt in the past
If you thought it was gonna be more than me tapping that ass
I'm sorry if we kicked it and we got too close
I can't deal with commitment so I'm sorry I'm ghost
I'm sorry I got honeys all over the place
I'm sorry that I learned to lie with a poker face
I'm sorry to all the chicks that I gassed on tour
Told'em I keep in touch but I don't see them no more
I'm sorry we was involved and you got your heart broken
I'm sorry it went down like that I ain't joking
I'm sorry it had to be that way
I'm sorry for all the games I felt I had to play
I'm sorry if I was grimy and I hit your friend
And even though I'm sorry I'd probably do it again
I'm sorry sometimes I only think of myself
I'm sorry I ain't warned you before we dealt
I'm sorry Shortee said I was her favourite rapper
I'm sorry I had no self control and had to tap her

I'm sorry life is filled with all type of hard knocks
And if you can't handle it, shortee, kick rocks
