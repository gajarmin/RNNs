[Hook - Nate Dogg]
One for the treble, two for the bass
She's my beauty queen, she's my everything
When I wake up in the morning gotta get that thing
This is where I wanna be with Mary Jane (sweet Mary Jane)
Ooooooo Mary Jane
Ooooooo Mary Jane

[Warren G]
Mary Jane, you are my everything
I'm in love with you
Now I realized why Rick James fucked with you
Since I said "I Do" I never cheated on you
Even when your sister-sis came through
I ain't trying to stress you
Cuz everytime I call, baby doll you be at my rescue
I can't sweat you
We just homie loving friends
Besides, I heard you fucking Snoop Dogg again

[Snoop Dogg]
G-Dub, that's my bitch, how the fuck she gon' love me?
I love that bitch, why the fuck you gon' leave me?
I'm in the green room and I'm fucking up the scenery
With my nigga Buddy Love blazing up some sticky burns
Yeah we go hit it 'cuz, have a seat and drink with us
Puff, puff, pass that shit
Smoke it all down to the ashes bitch
213 with another classic hit

[Nate Dogg]
I'm in love with Mary Jane
She is my main thang
Stay away from hocus poucus
She gives me headdaches man
And when my sack gets low
Sweet Mary swings on by
Breaks me off something proper
That woman keeps me ???

That's why I'm lying
I ain't fucking with nothing but the lime green
If you smoking 'cess then dont invite me
However if it's chronic do the right thing
I'm all she cuz ain't no maybe
We met on 21st and fucking Lime Street
Take ya fucking homey, where my girl be?
The only fucking way you can excite me
Is Mary Jane

[Hook]

[Warren G]
I done sinned, sipped on gin with other women
But kept it respectful like a gentlemen
I spend to hit that ass or go and get the cab
So I can hit the last laugh
Tonight if it's not the bomb, then I'mma be mad
But I'm sure it won't last for long, I got a stash at home
Make love 'tween my Swisher with my half a zone
I can't leave you alone

[Snoop Dogg]
And I know that you know that I be smoking and you about to ooee
So fire it up and get high with me
And let me see if you get as high as me
Now that's what's happening
Cuz I know that you probably don't believe what you hear and you see
A nigga like the D-O-double-G-Z
So put your hands up in the air and repeat after me
213

Dance with me
Take a chance with me (This is your chance)
Take a dip with me
Don't go

[Snoop Dogg]
Oh no, I have a party to attend
With some civilized people, and some more of my friends
I wish I could stick around
But I gotta take a trip back uptown, now
Layin wit'chu, stayin wit'chu
Playin wit'chu, is somethin I ain't gone do
Now look here boo, there's so many freaks up in here
And I done already been there, so I don't really care
Now you can take that, take that
Bitch, I know you hate that, hate that
You can't do nothin about it
You know damn well what I got back at the house
And I refuse to loose, trade in my shoes
Gimme the blues, hand my the booze
Strap on the fools, overabuse or misuse it
So I'm skatin steady, datin on the move to groove
I ain't got nothin to prove infact, I got too much to lose
Girl, you got a nigga way ? and way too cool
But I ain't leavin here wit'chu, for real

[Goldie Loc]
Yo, this the single house
We gone disconnect the TV, leave the stereo and move the couch
Everybody get they groove on
I'm sweatin like a rainy day, but I get my groove on
Dip baby dip, fall back a little bit while I hold the hips
Pass me the drink, while you hit this G-13
Pocket holler one time, fashion statement clean
Stacy Adams supe it up, baby girl boot it up
Almost dropped my glass when she lift that damn booty up
Dog walk to the cat walk
I'm ridin that ass like Tony Hawk
There's somethin about the way you blow my mind
Got me wanna boogie all the time
Baby this is what I'm lovin
Forget the last dance just to end up huggin, let's dance

[Tray Deee]
Lil' momma got a gang of ass
Plus that mini-skirt make me think she fast
Passed by and asked if she'd like to dance
Spark a conversation to ignite the flash
Bling bling all gleam, and I'm clean to whip
Saw the proper full crew I'm leavin with
You can act like the mack don't effect your type
Cuz you know a nigga tryin to have sex tonight
Ain't no secret, come freak with the real McCoy
Skip the guilt trip baby and just feel the joy
Make it rugged like you love it, never soft and sweet
Throw ya legs in the air and just start to beat
You can leave your thong on like it's all discrete
But it'll slide to the side when you fall asleep
Is you sho' that you can roll, dip, and smoke with me
Girl cuz I'mma give it to ya like it's 'sposed to be

[Kokane]
Come fuck with me
Drink with me
Smoke with me
Yeah, yeah

Drink some Hennesey
Goldie Loc, and Tray Deee

Me and Nate Dogg were so funky fresh
We fell off into a club to try to pop it to Daz
A lil' Moet to go with the way I'm dressed
A seven-piece outfit with a mink vest
Couple of ladies skating waiting on some info
Them white boys in the back got the indo
With a hookup, a hundredd dollars for a half ounce
I got to hit it, get it and bounce
So right back to the place that I started from
Get back hell yeah I'm hardly done
Write that on your motherfucking izzass
So hold up your glass and let's make a lil' tizoast
We brag and boast, zig-zag and smoke and keep a big bag of dope
We hold down the VIP wherever we sit
Nigga don't get mad if your ho with me

[Nate Dogg]
I'm not absolutely positive or absolutely sure
I'm not out to talk bad about your baby
I'm just tyring to be completely sure
You wanna hang with us, gotta hang with us
Take ya ass to the floor
You try'n to claim a bitch, sound rediculous
Hope the ho is not yours

[Snoop Dogg]
Dancing and wining and dining a bitch
We humping bumping and grinding the shit
Nothing else to do now but to leave the club
So we can rub-a-dub-dub in my nigga Nate hot tub
Then we can grub on some barbeque
That my Uncle Rio hooked up, so call your crew
10, 11, 12, or 13, all of them bitches they belong to her team
It's so supreme you love my scheme
The way I got baby bringing Daddy all the cream
Yep, and that's the first step
And once you get that, nigga ya got that?
Pump that shit and fill up my cup and mack that bitch with the big ol' butt
Don't play with it - sway with it
And if it's cool with you, shit you know I'm okay with it

[Hook - Nate Dogg]
Right back, baby girl I know you like that
You try to hide it but you get
Right back, come on over for a nightcap
Yes even though I'm with the right trap
Tell your man that you'll be right back
Even though we only just met
Make sure you don't forget the Jim' pack

I'm not absolutely positive or absolutely sure
I'm not out to talk bad about your baby
I'm just tyring to be completely sure
You wanna hang with us, gotta hang with us
Take ya ass to the floor
I'm trying to game a bit, sound rediculous
Hope the ho is not yours

[Hook]

[Warren G]
Whats happening to the thugs that be back in the club
And of course lil' mama who be backing it up
We be the ones back in the Cut' smoking
Cognac in the cup, we be stroking
After the club, same routine, roll two 13s
Since her front clean yahknowimean?
Tight jeans, ice bling, no ring, no thang
Show off, show her Nate can sing
Show her how my team do our thi-dang
And how we keep Latrell Sprewells sprinning
I'm all hood so the Chucks stay on
It's all good we can do it 'til the break of dawn

[Hook][Intro]
Ahhh shit (woo!)
Yeah, you know we up in this motherfucker
You know what I mean?
Dogg-motherfuckin'-house

[Chorus]
You can't tell me shit, get pistol whipped
Fuck what you say, it's the gangsta shit
We the gangsta click, kickin' gangsta shit
Fuck what you say, get pistol whipped

[Daz Dillinger]
Put your khaki's and your blue rags and your Chuck's on
It's Dat Nigga Daz, we rollin' in a black Brougham
Rollin' just gettin' domed
Just like a packed tail nigga, cause I got to roam
Holdin' my own, step the wrong way, you'll get blown
CHA-POW nigga, you're gone
Look out - stoned out, bombed out
With the niggas, we run my neighborhood with major clout
On this - paper route, street grindin'
Blindin' y'all niggas when we thug it out
Rip it out, dip it out, shippin' it all out
Nigga we outta here
We stone cold fools, for the cream
Supreme team, with billion dollar dreams
With trillion dollar schemes
With a infra-blue beam
Stickin' and whippin' niggas just for cream
See I'm a Dogg Pound mobster, boogie monster
Chest stomper, Dat Nigga Daz always into somethin'
Here you go, you hear my bass bumpin'
Stompin', like N.W.A. I'm into somethin'
HA HA, see, the boys in the hood is way too hard
21st, the loc'est nigga on the boulevard

[Chorus]
You can't tell me shit, get pistol whipped

We the gangsta click, kickin' gangsta shit
Fuck what you say, get pistol whipped

This gang bangin' ain't stoppin'
'Fore you know it I'll be up on the top
Ballin' way outta control whether you like me or not
I'm silky smooth with the gangsta groove, I'll make you move
Don't give a fuck what you say, that's just my attitude
On the West, bitches don't play that shit
Nigga bounce, gotta ounce?, nigga blaze that shit
Ah shit, bitches wanna play me for a fool
So I - act a fool, I'm too hot to keep cool
They wanna know where I got it, don't worry 'bout shit
Just know I'm 'bout that 'bout it
If a bitch blow up in this game, don't doubt it
Eliminatin' bitch niggas cause the game's too crowded
If you see me blast off like a heat seeker, hummin'
If the earth started shake, you know I'm comin'
Runnin' shit, like it's s'posed to be
I'm takin' off on any trick tryin' to get close to me

[Snoop Dogg]
It's the mythological, chronical, diabolicle
Pyschological, make a model ho fuck a G
Polish ya, demolish ya, turn you all into particles
Shade tree niggas in the game, I lose 'em like follicles
But that goes in pathetico, vaticles into articles
Read 'bout particles, and I heard that I shot a few
But that's what you gotta do when you're livin' so radical
From me to you my nigga, never yap without your gat fool
Bang bang, we don't play
We fuckin' 'em up er'day, that's why you got carried away
I guess you got carried away, but it's alright, it's okay
Cause we gon' play er'day, I'll cut you like a DJ
*r-r-roa* - cut so fresh
Better yet, I'll put a slug in your chest - yep
And then I'll blind you, bleed you, guide you and mislead you
Tape you, strip you, rape you, then proceed to -
Put yo' ass up under the dirt (uh hu)
No more pain and no more hurt
I jerk that jerk up out of his skirt
Snoop Dogg stay puttin' in work, motherfucker

Runnin' shit, like it's s'posed to be
I'm takin' off on any trick tryin' to get close to me

[Daz Dillinger]
*CHA-POW*
(shoot 'em, shoot 'em up)
Up jump the boogie to the boogie
To bang bang to the boogie, bang bang
(shoot 'em, shoot 'em up)
Up jump the boogie to the boogie
To bang bang to the boogie, bang bang
(shoot 'em, shoot 'em up)
Up jump the boogie to the boogie
To bang bang to the boogie, bang bang
(shoot 'em, shoot 'em up)
Up jump the boogie to the boog-idy-bee
(Snoop Dogg!)

[Snoop Dogg]
It's the mythological, chronical, diabolicle
Pyschological, make a model ho fuck a G
Polish ya, demolish ya, turn you all into particles
Shade tree niggas in the game, I lose 'em like follicles
But that goes in pathetico, vaticles into articles
Read 'bout particles, and I heard that I shot a few
But that's what you gotta do when you're livin' so radical
From me to you my nigga, never yap without your gat fool
Bang bang, we don't play
We fuckin' 'em up er'day, that's why you got carried away
I guess you got carried away, but it's alright, it's okay
Cause we gon' play er'day, I'll cut you like a DJ
*r-r-roa* - cut so fresh
Better yet, I'll put a slug in your chest - yep
And then I'll blind you, bleed you, guide you and mislead you
Tape you, strip you, rape you, then proceed to -
Put yo' ass up under the dirt (uh hu)
No more pain and no more hurt
I jerk that jerk up out of his skirt
Snoop Dogg stay puttin' in work, motherfucker

[Crystal]
Run up and get dropped
Stop and get popped
Me and my niggas, we don't stop, won't stop
Run up and get dropped
Stop and get popped
Me and my niggas, we don't stop, won't stop
Run up and get dropped
Stop and get popped
Me and my niggas, we don't stop, won't stop
Run up and get dropped
Stop and get popped
Me and my niggas, we don't stop, won't stop

[Chorus]
You can't tell me shit, get pistol whipped
Fuck what you say, it's the gangsta shit
We the gangsta click, kickin' gangsta shit
Fuck what you say, get pistol whipped[Lil' Mo (Kokane)]
Roll with me
Come smoke with me (Smoke with me)
Come close to me
So low (Come flow with me)
Dance with me
Take a chance with me (This is your chance)
Take a dip with me
Don't go

[Snoop Dogg]
Oh no, I have a party to attend
With some civilized people, and some more of my friends
I wish I could stick around
But I gotta take a trip back uptown, now
Layin wit'chu, stayin wit'chu
Playin wit'chu, is somethin I ain't gone do
Now look here boo, there's so many freaks up in here
And I done already been there, so I don't really care
Now you can take that, take that
Bitch, I know you hate that, hate that
You can't do nothin about it
You know damn well what I got back at the house
And I refuse to loose, trade in my shoes
Gimme the blues, hand my the booze
Strap on the fools, overabuse or misuse it
So I'm skatin steady, datin on the move to groove
I ain't got nothin to prove infact, I got too much to lose
Girl, you got a nigga way ? and way too cool
But I ain't leavin here wit'chu, for real

[Goldie Loc]
Yo, this the single house
We gone disconnect the TV, leave the stereo and move the couch
Everybody get they groove on
I'm sweatin like a rainy day, but I get my groove on
Dip baby dip, fall back a little bit while I hold the hips
Pass me the drink, while you hit this G-13
Pocket holler one time, fashion statement clean
Stacy Adams supe it up, baby girl boot it up
Almost dropped my glass when she lift that damn booty up
Dog walk to the cat walk
I'm ridin that ass like Tony Hawk
There's somethin about the way you blow my mind
Got me wanna boogie all the time
Baby this is what I'm lovin
Forget the last dance just to end up huggin, let's dance

[Tray Deee]
Lil' momma got a gang of ass
Plus that mini-skirt make me think she fast
Passed by and asked if she'd like to dance
Spark a conversation to ignite the flash
Bling bling all gleam, and I'm clean to whip
Saw the proper full crew I'm leavin with
You can act like the mack don't effect your type
Cuz you know a nigga tryin to have sex tonight
Ain't no secret, come freak with the real McCoy
Skip the guilt trip baby and just feel the joy
Make it rugged like you love it, never soft and sweet
Throw ya legs in the air and just start to beat
You can leave your thong on like it's all discrete
But it'll slide to the side when you fall asleep
Is you sho' that you can roll, dip, and smoke with me
Girl cuz I'mma give it to ya like it's 'sposed to be

[Kokane]
Come fuck with me
Drink with me
Smoke with me
Yeah, yeah
Loc with me
Drink some Hennesey
Goldie Loc, and Tray Deee
Yeah, yeah

[Snoop talking (Lil' Mo singing in background)]
Yeah you tryin to fuck with a nigga huh
I can't even trip though
It might seem like, some shit like, two-two
Beep-beep, haha, two-two
Beep-beep, two-two [Repeat until fade]
