[Intro]
You know what
I like the playettes
No diggity, no doubt
Play on playette, play on playette
Yo Dre, drop the verse

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
It's going down, fade to Blackstreet
The homies got at me, collab' creations, bump like acne
No doubt, I put it down, never slouch
As long as my credit can vouch, a dog couldn't catch me ass out
Tell me who can stop when Dre makin' moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving 'em eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavor
With the homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers

[Verse 2: Teddy Riley]
Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em open all over town
Strictly biz, she don't play around
Cover much ground, got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her out of my mind (Wow)
I think about the girl all the time (Wow wow)
East side to the west side
Pushin' phat rides, it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash
Stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
She's on when she's got to have it
Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
Can I get down, so I can win

[Refrain x4]
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up

[Verse 3:]
She's got class and style
Street knowledge by the pound
Baby never act wild, very low key on the profile
Catchin' feelings is a no
Let me tell you how it goes
Herb's the word, spin's the verb
Lovers it curves so freak what you heard
Rollin' with the phatness
You don't even know what the half is
You gotta pay to play
Just for shorty, bang-bang, to look your way
I like the way you work it
Trump tight all day, every day
You're blowing my mind, maybe in time
Baby, I can get you in my ride

[Refrain x2]

[Break]
Hey oh, hey oh, hey oh, hey oh

[Verse 4: Queen Pen]
Cause that's my peeps and we roll deep
Flyin' first class from New York City to Blackstreet
What you know about me, not a motherfuckin' thing
Cartier wooded frames sported by my shortie
As for me, icy gleaming pinky diamond ring
We be's the baddest clique up on the scene
Ain't you getting bored with these fake ass broads
I shows and proves, no doubt, how predictably so
Please excuse, if I come across rude
That's just me and that's how the playettes got to be
Stay kickin' game with a capital G
Axe the peoples on my block, I'm as real as can be
Word is bond, faking moves never been my thing
So, Teddy, pass the word to your nigga Chauncy
I be sitting in car, let's say around 3:30
Queen Pen and Blackstreet, it's no diggity[Queen Pen]

1 - 	Yo, a party ain't a party 'till it's ran all through
	And leave it to my crew, it's gon' be playa' proof
	After three rounds we gon' blow off this roof
	A party ain't a party 'til it's ran all through

Repeat 1

Shorty, who you be, you're staring at me instantly
As I walk into this vide(o) I can feel you diggin' me
Wit' yo' glass of Rhemy, you had one too many
But still I'm impressed wit' cho' wild out Henney
It's a party and I got's to run all through
But maybe later on we can chat over booze
See I thought you knew, ain't no delaying what I'm saying
Want me to rewind and collect on my track, it won't wait
I said it's a party, I gots to run all through
We holding 20 plus we can follow if you choose
See ain't nothing changed, since the days of the Q
Except uh, elimination that wanna chew up my crew
Yes you, but you true I got to browse on through
You can catch me at the bar being shady to my old crew
How I do?  Make moves like I shoot
Catch me on the rebound, make at the tunnel
Catch me on the rebound, or maybe at the tummy

Repeat 1

Repeat 1

[Mr Cheeks]
I'm tipsy from the cab, down the whole bottle of Henney
Peepin' shorties in my biz and seeing many
But there's something about you
You seem off the hook
Givin' me that "I want to say something" look
Plus that dress you wearin'
Got my whole team starin'
You not bouncin' with me, I'm not hearin'
Lickin' the lips for real like you really want it
Is you dealing with the cat that's blunted?
Stay forever real shorty Ra', is you down
To go home wit' the champ a whole round?  You see
I had my eyes on you from way across the room
You looked so good from over here, I can smell your perfume
I assume, if I got ta come and  get ya
Ya'd think I was only out to hit ya
See, you's an intelligent chick
With that Nestle type of smile
Held my temptations back for awhile
Tell my brother Tah Lee, I'll be back, yeah
That's Pretty Lou and Spigg Nice, so watch my jacket
Make her touch to my lips, put the drink in my hand
'Till the center my legs expand
Cuz

[Freeky Tah]
That's how we do
Better forget her for me and you
I give a shout out to my whole crew
From New York City to Chicago too

Repeat 1

Repeat 1

[Markell Riley]

Now a party ain't a party until I run through it
Pick 'em stick 'em sick 'em, that how I do it
Move it, get down keepin' ya'll movin'
Certified game tight prove it, aight!
Deala of the dancefloor, makin' all ya'll stomp and clap
Ya feelin' me?, damn sure
I had the answers for ya dancers
Since way back, puttin' it down like that

[Nutta Butta]

I came in the door, 20 or more
Watch the dancefloor, cause we like it raw
Dom got my head spinnin' like a set of rims
Nutta Butta like a pair of Timbs
What the deal shorty?, wanna rock with me
Take ya back, do the wop wit' me
Spend the cash like Monopoly
Words slurred and my vision is blurred
But a party ain't a party 'til I slide with a bird, what?

Repeat 1 until fade{*Pen whispers "I Reps" while DJ Clue is talking*}

Killa, P-Double, Queen Pen, Lee Low

(DJ Clue)
Yeah, DJ Clue
You know how we do things
Q-U-Double E radio
And the question of the day is
What you rep(Intro)
Queen Pen: Me'shell Ndegeocello, play for me, c'mon talk to me
Me'shell: anyone know, it never ceases to amaze me how everbody's always in
Somebody else's buisness, looking for something, but 'cha know
For what it's worth - We could give a fuck!

(chorus)
Me'shell: Girlfriend, girlfriend, yes i had your girlfriend
Queen Pen: If that was your girlfriend, if that was your girlfriend
If that
Was your girlfriend, she wasn't last night  (x2)

(verse 1)
Now how you just gon' be playa hatin' on me
Coz i got mad bitches just wanting me
And i got mad niggas just checkin' for me see
I got more stock than you ever see, i be...
The one that your main squeeze been diggin
Pull you out your closet, sex on weekends
It's my buisness of what i do, him or her, he or she, inside you
So while you be yappin' and talkin to your friends
Beefin 'bout that yellow chicken, the green benz
I'll be havin' all your people's info with the second part of my ???
She slid the number, what you gettin mad at me for
She said she was single when she closed my car door

(chorus)

(verse 2)
Me'shell: so queen tell me, where did you meet her

Queen Pen: On the sunday, mac, she was walking out ???
I was just chillin, mindin my own business
Sittin on the corner, waitin for my sister
When she slid by, maybe 4 or 5 times
Wanted me to notice the rythm of her thighs
Oh boy, uh, girls are just so funny to me
I can see how niggas get into these beefs
She knew she had a man when she came up in the piece
She said she was a regular and how about me
If she gave me her digits would i call her after three
The way she fliked her hips made you move to have to see
How these chinese jamaican tried to draw it by me
It never ceases to amaze me

Me'shell: Ain't nobody gotta know just how much you want me

(chorus)

(verse 3)
Now how i've ran, you've only a few
But you can  back track and ask them how i do it how it is
Who the flyest chick, with the phattest whip
And run her all night, like a burger with a chip
And if it's all good then i feature it again
Like a fix remix, (if you need a fix)
See you gots to be real like my ex beverly
You don't have your man just stressin out on me
Coz he can't control how you throw your pussy
I'm a baller and i been for a ???
And if i choose to jerk her off then it's all on me
See you claimed that was your girl, well that's not how it seems
Uh, it never ceases to amaze me

Me'shell: Coz i like to get down so if you's wants ta i will
I love to love ya'  baby

(chorus)(Intro)
Uh, it's all for you, my melody boo
This lovin' is all for you, break it down, how you feel about this

Verse 1
Reminiscing to back in our beginning
Sweet politicing in the heart of the village
We slid digits on low, exchanged a couple of 'hellos'
As you slid out the door
I remember clearly makein' moves up the steps we made eye contact
It was his gleam that brought me back, ligit
How we met on some real ghetto star shit
Mad chicks on my melody's dick
See he got this kinda grace about himself
Dealin' with fast life all flooded up with wealth
So for him, cuties just be comin' like a dime a dozen
Smooth talkin' brothers always get easy fuckin'
But I ain't mad, at all of his cutie head lovin'
And all his playin hard to get was worth tryin' to get my lovin
He's got personality for days
The kinda melody others bad talkin' many ways
The kinda beat that always stays paid, my special kinda boo who always
Appreciates gettin' laid
My melody...

(sung)
Just the way. I wanna be loved
Yeah...

Verse 2
True, we been together from the very beginning
Since blocks be turned into states, baguettes be turned into cakes
So he be knowin' how I'm down by law
Plus his knowledge himself be havin' his mentality bore
He gets first bids when I'm blowin' in from tour
His sex is respected behind closed doors
Listen, he the bomb, I can't tell you different
It's a fact how he mistify me like Kaiser Sosack
Uh, it feels good to know how others wish they could be loved
In the clubs bitches screwin' up their mugs because
They envious to how my boo is true to this
Gold diggin' bitches always be disputing shit
That don't even concern them, I'm learnin'
The next chick that try to make your melody a B-track
But true, he be bigger than that
My boo be realisin' that his wifey'll always have his back, uh
...Check out my melody...

(sung)
Cause you love me baby....
Just the way I wanna be loved
Yeah...

Verse 3
Communication be never a mess
Coz he be keepin' street conflict away from this relationship
He's got a mind of his own
He's a leader, not scared to be a dreamer, my black man digger
And I be down till the day that I die, loyalty bonafied
So how ask why I, dedicated all my love to his cause
Financially lock him down, hide his monies from the law 'coz
No matter what my melody be's a good man
No m,atter how he ran on the actions of his plan and
I be down till the day that I die
Loyalty bonafied, my melody and I... uh

(sung)
'Coz you love me baby
Just the way I wanna be loved
Yeah... It's so nice lyin' here in you arms
Your personality has that charm
'Coz you love me baby
Just the way I wanna be loved
Oooh I could stay here for the rest of my life
I wanna be your lover, wanna maybe you wife
'Coz you love me baby
Just the way I wanna be loved
Yeah... Yeah... You love me baby...Intro:

Poppin mad shit on that mix tape shit
But when it's time to face a heat, you on that other type shit

Chorus: Joe Hooker
You will never be better than me
See you much too smart to me
You will never be better than me

Makin trips outta town, I gotta survive type shit
Cashin in my stamps to make the ends meet shit
How do my niggas dose on some real legal shit
On the low that's that real have your back type shit

Chorus

[Queen Pen]
We gets down for I's on some ghetto star shit

Yo, "Return of Jack the Ripper," what? Nigga please
I'mma push you further back than your hairline recedes
New York City, don't get it confused
Your song will last as long as your part in "Krush Groove"
Body moves, the battles, bullets, the lesson
You write about being a veteran, but not a legend
Back from the war with thirty-two medals of honor
You claimin' underground but never been to Bobbito the Barber
Gimme them medals back, since you forgot how to rap
Call DJ Bobcat and ask him where them old records at
Like Channel Five karate, my kick is gonna reach ya
A new episode where the student kills the teacher
Any last words before I send you to your dream?
Hold my hands and pray
[Lyrics in Creole]
You don't got knowledge yourself
So you don't know what that mean, a'ight?
Who suped you up to do the record in the first place?
It lacked taste, you get "The Gas Face" like 3rd Bass
L.L. stands for Lickin' Lyor, or Lickin' Lichty
Lickin' Lyles, Lickin' Labels, lickin' they balls
Under the conference room table
When you hear this record, you bound to go AWOL
I worked too hard, for this life is serious
This ain't bulls-eye, I ain't your target practice
So call Mr. Martin, I rarely kill often
But in this sound clash, I got a bodybuilder's coffin
Back from Miami where your record got no heat
That's why your Def Jam interns call it "Battle of the Beats"
You're weak nigga!

[Hook]
What's Clef got to do with this, got to do with this?

Tell your ghost writers, "Go write something better"

Guess who? Uh-oh, uh-oh
Here we go-o, uh-oh
Every two records you do scenario
You get the best MCs, how? To rhyme first
Of course you rap last, so you can show off your skirt
I guess it didn't work on "4 3 2 1"
You got out done by Canibus the young gun
Your last weapon, is to call out Wyclef Jean
Not knowing that you callin' fire for your cremation
Jammin' and cool, sumpthin' like you
Jamaicans say, "L.L. a fool"
Kids wet too who do the pool
Let bells ring like Sunday school
L.L. Cool J is hard as hell?
So hard at night he's Jezebel
I heard the teller, Himmemel
How you think he wrote the song?
Rock the bells!

[The Product]
Yo, Clef
I know you got styles, but get back to the issue kid
This is real!

[Wyclef Jean]
Yo, don't get me angry, like the Hulk, I'll turn green
Your marriage is a cover up, cause you use Vaseline
Fun love of hip-hop, these lyrics got you steamed
Knowing damn well that bad men don't wear g-strings
Another side of Clef, the face you won't seein' oppressed
I even got the Devil worshippers sayin', "God bless"
You star struck, and I'mma buck you like Carlito
And when they say, "Who did it?," you tell them Benny Blanco
Wyclef, preacher's son, check the revelation
Polygram buy Def Jam for twenty million
MCA buy Polygram for eleven billion
I come to Sony and get pimped by the Haitian-Sicilians
And I'll even, get you an ad in "The Source"
You'll be the first rapper selling products for hair loss
The W-Y-C-L-E-F, Wyclef
The return of Jack the Ripper was only to meet his death
The next time, you wanna dis me for kicks
Get off my dick, go somewhere and lick your lips, bitch!

On the really girl, you don't want no conflict
Save your slick talk for Saturday night's at plex
QP is back, what did y'all expect?
That I stay pregnant forever, and live off of my publishing cheques?
All this bad chat got me kind of vexed
Y'all been talkin about me ever since I fucked that nigga from Next

I rep money dealers, girls step like, "Cam you rock a lotta Prada"
Look to her and said, "bitch I'm bout the dollar", holla
I don't like it anways, I feel enscadas hotter
One get her, get her, good dog,  got her, got her
Cam is in a Lincolns Clipse
Jay say Belvedere, now y'all drinkin the shit
Please, oh my god brother, followin is not gutter
Its a major trend setter for you cock suckers
Insurance on my diamonds, my rocks covered
If I'm wit a bitch, believe me I do not love her
I'ma rap like a doobie and spliff
My Uzi a click, yeah I did a movie a flick
But I step to the director like, "look I'm not bitchin"
Understand this homeboy, I'm not snitchin
Killa Cam still be back in the hood
Back where I should, plus I can't act that good
I could cook that coke, get them figures
I could bust that gat, strip some niggas
No homo, cause my life ain't no  motion picture
Motion trigger, I open livers, cock the pump
Pop the trunk, I drive em to the ocean nigga
Peal em apart, let em know you dealin wit sharks

Killa, P-Double, Queen Pen, Lee Low

(DJ Clue)
Yeah, DJ Clue
You know how we do things
Q-U-Double E radio
And the question of the day is
What you rep[Intro]
You know what
I like the playettes
No diggity, no doubt
Play on playette, play on playette
Yo Dre, drop the verse

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
It's going down, fade to Blackstreet
The homies got at me, collab' creations, bump like acne
No doubt, I put it down, never slouch
As long as my credit can vouch, a dog couldn't catch me ass out
Tell me who can stop when Dre makin' moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving 'em eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavor
With the homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers

[Verse 2: Teddy Riley]
Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em open all over town
Strictly biz, she don't play around
Cover much ground, got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her out of my mind (Wow)
I think about the girl all the time (Wow wow)
East side to the west side
Pushin' phat rides, it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash
Stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
She's on when she's got to have it
Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
Can I get down, so I can win

[Refrain x4]
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up

[Verse 3:]
She's got class and style
Street knowledge by the pound
Baby never act wild, very low key on the profile
Catchin' feelings is a no
Let me tell you how it goes
Herb's the word, spin's the verb
Lovers it curves so freak what you heard
Rollin' with the phatness
You don't even know what the half is
You gotta pay to play
Just for shorty, bang-bang, to look your way
I like the way you work it
Trump tight all day, every day
You're blowing my mind, maybe in time
Baby, I can get you in my ride

[Refrain x2]

[Break]
Hey oh, hey oh, hey oh, hey oh

[Verse 4: Queen Pen]
Cause that's my peeps and we roll deep
Flyin' first class from New York City to Blackstreet
What you know about me, not a motherfuckin' thing
Cartier wooded frames sported by my shortie
As for me, icy gleaming pinky diamond ring
We be's the baddest clique up on the scene
Ain't you getting bored with these fake ass broads
I shows and proves, no doubt, how predictably so
Please excuse, if I come across rude
That's just me and that's how the playettes got to be
Stay kickin' game with a capital G
Axe the peoples on my block, I'm as real as can be
Word is bond, faking moves never been my thing
So, Teddy, pass the word to your nigga Chauncy
I be sitting in car, let's say around 3:30
Queen Pen and Blackstreet, it's no diggity[Queen Pen]

1 - 	Yo, a party ain't a party 'till it's ran all through
	And leave it to my crew, it's gon' be playa' proof
	After three rounds we gon' blow off this roof
	A party ain't a party 'til it's ran all through

Repeat 1

Shorty, who you be, you're staring at me instantly
As I walk into this vide(o) I can feel you diggin' me
Wit' yo' glass of Rhemy, you had one too many
But still I'm impressed wit' cho' wild out Henney
It's a party and I got's to run all through
But maybe later on we can chat over booze
See I thought you knew, ain't no delaying what I'm saying
Want me to rewind and collect on my track, it won't wait
I said it's a party, I gots to run all through
We holding 20 plus we can follow if you choose
See ain't nothing changed, since the days of the Q
Except uh, elimination that wanna chew up my crew
Yes you, but you true I got to browse on through
You can catch me at the bar being shady to my old crew
How I do?  Make moves like I shoot
Catch me on the rebound, make at the tunnel
Catch me on the rebound, or maybe at the tummy

Repeat 1

Repeat 1

[Mr Cheeks]
I'm tipsy from the cab, down the whole bottle of Henney
Peepin' shorties in my biz and seeing many
But there's something about you
You seem off the hook
Givin' me that "I want to say something" look
Plus that dress you wearin'
Got my whole team starin'
You not bouncin' with me, I'm not hearin'
Lickin' the lips for real like you really want it
Is you dealing with the cat that's blunted?
Stay forever real shorty Ra', is you down
To go home wit' the champ a whole round?  You see
I had my eyes on you from way across the room
You looked so good from over here, I can smell your perfume
I assume, if I got ta come and  get ya
Ya'd think I was only out to hit ya
See, you's an intelligent chick
With that Nestle type of smile
Held my temptations back for awhile
Tell my brother Tah Lee, I'll be back, yeah
That's Pretty Lou and Spigg Nice, so watch my jacket
Make her touch to my lips, put the drink in my hand
'Till the center my legs expand
Cuz

[Freeky Tah]
That's how we do
Better forget her for me and you
I give a shout out to my whole crew
From New York City to Chicago too

Repeat 1

Repeat 1

[Markell Riley]

Now a party ain't a party until I run through it
Pick 'em stick 'em sick 'em, that how I do it
Move it, get down keepin' ya'll movin'
Certified game tight prove it, aight!
Deala of the dancefloor, makin' all ya'll stomp and clap
Ya feelin' me?, damn sure
I had the answers for ya dancers
Since way back, puttin' it down like that

[Nutta Butta]

I came in the door, 20 or more
Watch the dancefloor, cause we like it raw
Dom got my head spinnin' like a set of rims
Nutta Butta like a pair of Timbs
What the deal shorty?, wanna rock with me
Take ya back, do the wop wit' me
Spend the cash like Monopoly
Words slurred and my vision is blurred
But a party ain't a party 'til I slide with a bird, what?

Yo, "Return of Jack the Ripper," what? Nigga please
I'mma push you further back than your hairline recedes
New York City, don't get it confused
Your song will last as long as your part in "Krush Groove"
Body moves, the battles, bullets, the lesson
You write about being a veteran, but not a legend
Back from the war with thirty-two medals of honor
You claimin' underground but never been to Bobbito the Barber
Gimme them medals back, since you forgot how to rap
Call DJ Bobcat and ask him where them old records at
Like Channel Five karate, my kick is gonna reach ya
A new episode where the student kills the teacher
Any last words before I send you to your dream?
Hold my hands and pray
[Lyrics in Creole]
You don't got knowledge yourself
So you don't know what that mean, a'ight?
Who suped you up to do the record in the first place?
It lacked taste, you get "The Gas Face" like 3rd Bass
L.L. stands for Lickin' Lyor, or Lickin' Lichty
Lickin' Lyles, Lickin' Labels, lickin' they balls
Under the conference room table
When you hear this record, you bound to go AWOL
I worked too hard, for this life is serious
This ain't bulls-eye, I ain't your target practice
So call Mr. Martin, I rarely kill often
But in this sound clash, I got a bodybuilder's coffin
Back from Miami where your record got no heat
That's why your Def Jam interns call it "Battle of the Beats"
You're weak nigga!

Every two records you do scenario
You get the best MCs, how? To rhyme first
Of course you rap last, so you can show off your skirt
I guess it didn't work on "4 3 2 1"
You got out done by Canibus the young gun
Your last weapon, is to call out Wyclef Jean
Not knowing that you callin' fire for your cremation
Jammin' and cool, sumpthin' like you
Jamaicans say, "L.L. a fool"
Kids wet too who do the pool
Let bells ring like Sunday school
L.L. Cool J is hard as hell?
So hard at night he's Jezebel
I heard the teller, Himmemel
How you think he wrote the song?
Rock the bells!

Yo, Clef
I know you got styles, but get back to the issue kid
This is real!

[Wyclef Jean]
Yo, don't get me angry, like the Hulk, I'll turn green
Your marriage is a cover up, cause you use Vaseline
Fun love of hip-hop, these lyrics got you steamed
Knowing damn well that bad men don't wear g-strings
Another side of Clef, the face you won't seein' oppressed
I even got the Devil worshippers sayin', "God bless"
You star struck, and I'mma buck you like Carlito
And when they say, "Who did it?," you tell them Benny Blanco
Wyclef, preacher's son, check the revelation
Polygram buy Def Jam for twenty million
MCA buy Polygram for eleven billion
I come to Sony and get pimped by the Haitian-Sicilians
And I'll even, get you an ad in "The Source"
You'll be the first rapper selling products for hair loss
The W-Y-C-L-E-F, Wyclef
The return of Jack the Ripper was only to meet his death
The next time, you wanna dis me for kicks
Get off my dick, go somewhere and lick your lips, bitch!

Song:   All My Love

I'm taking you back
I'm taking you back
Here's another one

[Queen Pen]
Uh, yeah
I remember being on that nigga's chair, hard
Back in the day in the projects
Chasing after him, a lil' young chick
Seeing him made me go back in my lab
And write this lil' shit like this
Check it out

Here's how it goes
Used to see you when I went to the store
Always watch you play ball from my bedroom window
The places you frequent, the chicks you freaked with
The spot in the grass where you kept your stash

I used to wonder to myself if you felt my eyes
If you ever noticed me and knew I was alive
I tried to draw your attention, wore dresses to my thighs
With hopes to get close to you

Used to dream about you right before I went to sleep
Used to wake up on the morning hugging the sheets
Used to practice what I'd say for the day that we meet
Used to pray every day for the day that we meet

Used to hang with your sis if she only knew
I only hung with that bitch to get closer to you
Wasn't no limit to the things I would do
To give all my love to you, my God

[Eric]
Can't feel myself
Don't want nobody else to ever love you
You are my shining star, my guiding light, my love fantasy
There's not a minute, hour, day or night
I don't love you
You're at the top of my list
Cuz I'm always thinking of you
(Take it to the bridge)

All my love
(Cuz all my love's to you, my girl)
A thousand kisses from you and it wasn't enough
(Right, I'm taking you back, I'm taking you back, with another one)
I just don't wanna stop
Too much, never too much, never too much, never too much
(Yeah, uh huh, yeah, Queen Pen take it to the Brooklyn Bridge)

[Queen Pen]
Stop being by yourself, now you hung with the crew
I took the bangs out my hair over the summer, I grew
Me and my friends, all virgins, all learning
How to tow that shit, how to throw that shit

Talked about that sex like I was used to it
Lying about how many you used to kiss
In the hallways, all day, 'till it was real
In the staircase, lights out, giving out feels

Put your name in my notebook, we all did that
Lined our names up with numbers to see if they matched
Scared to death 'bout the first time, I knew it would hurt
In your house, on your mother's couch, she was at work

Dead wrong, but head strong, ya had in this broad
The only one I ever loved ever since I was young
Once in a while I even cut school to give all my love to you
My God

[Eric]
Can't feel myself
Don't want nobody else to ever love you
You are my shining star, my guiding light, my love fantasy
There's not a minute, hour, day or night
I don't love you
You're at the top of my list
Cuz I'm always thinking of you
(take it to the bridge)
All my love
(Cuz all my love's to you, my girl)
A thousand kisses from you and it wasn't enough
(Right, I'm taking you back, I'm taking you back, with another one)
I just don't wanna stop
Too much, never too much, never too much, never too much

[Both]
The breakdown, now bounce to this
Yeah, dedicated to the first love (right)
Uh, you know who you are, from the hood
It's all good (yeah) yeah
We gon' bounce ta dis
We make moves with this
Cuz all my love's to  you
Now bounce[Chorus: Repeat 3x]
I shouldn't loved him
I shouldn't wanted him
I shouldn't trust him
No I shouldn't fucked him
Now here I am carryin his seed
That makes two for him and a fourth for me

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I'm wreckin my brain, tryna to figure out
How we can come to this, how we even came about
We never took the time to measure the proper amounts
Or beef we would cause of sneakin around
If my brother even knew shit he'd proably flip out
And up until tonight we never had doubts
Remeber the first time that you slept over my house?
We made love to Donnell Jones, damn we so foul
But now its been a year from that day today
We still meet in the cut I can't live this way
Can't be no more us, fuck you feelin lame
What about me feelin loved, is sex all that its worth?
When it comes to us, I know that you love me
Its deeper then a nut, I know that you care for me
Its deeper then a nut

[Chorus: 3x]

[Verse 2]
You keep blamin it on him clamin him as a friend
Talkin about you and that nigga is tight like brothers
Fuck him, and I can put that on my life
So what he my baby daddy he don't do his child right
Tryna to explain I got tears in my eyes
This lump in my throat tryna hold back my cries
You talkin about me and ya booze ain't wise
Me and you has a cup Queen it just ain't right
You said it could never be yo niggas B.D. a wife
Tell me how would it look to the rest of my crew
You fuckin wit me Queen thats just bad news
I'm breakin rules but we just can't stop
I said we in too deep I'm not killin ya seed
I say we in too deep nigga I'm keepin my seed

[Chorus: 3x]

[Verse 3]
It really broke my heart to see you pushin that whip
When you couldn't even cop a new coat for yo kid
It really broke my heart when you cocked backed on me
When I was six months pregnant still beatin on me
It really fucked me up how you put me in debt
Fuckin up QPs dollars and sense
To think I catch your doughs and your whiz in my crib
Jeporadize a lively hood on me and my kids
And which one of those seeds belong to you
God would've been better of makin a cat or a baboon instead of you
Nigga I mean you ain't worth shit
A man that don't take care of his kids ain't worth lint
Now here I am I'm in love wit yo friend
And the only thing standin in the way is you bitch!
I cursed the day I ever even accepted your dick
Your daughters father don't know you
Tell her yo father is yo friend,  bitch

[Chorus: 3x][Intro]
Boy, I think that you should know
You could have all the doe
But you can't buy me, money can't buy me

1 - [Changing Faces]
You can have all the whips
You can have all the cribs
You can have all the chips
You can have all the hits
You have any girl you need
You can be living like a king
That don't mean anything you see
Cuz baby you ain't got me

[CF]
Baby, I know you're not tryin' to tempt me
Gas me up on empty
When you know I peeped game right from the door
You're mistaking
To think that I'll go crazy
You may think that I'm hating
But I'm not the least bit infatuated

2 - [CF]
I'm not impressed
With all these things you own
Could care less, save that
For some chick who don't know
I want a man who's got
It goin' on up top
And I know doe is cool
But it don't buy my love

Repeat 1

[CF]
Now you're skatin'
On Cloud Nine cuz they been
Playing your song on a station
And all them fakers are your new-found friends
Livin' lavish when you know you're average
You're too much with karats
Check you got a Benz
I was diggin' you more when you had nothing

Repeat 2
Repeat 1

[Queen Pen]
I see this end of the street done fucked your head up
You done made a little doe and stepped your game up
But you can't handle it like a real nigga could
I'd rather you stay broke and never left out the hood
You don't impress me yo, cuz I knew you from before
When you was doin' spot dates before doin' major tours
Before you hit it big, when you didn't have no whip
You was a nice guy, way back then
And I, can't deny, now you ain't worth shit
Tell me how you gon' live off of one good hit?
Go on, run your game on some new jack chicks
Cuz me and Changing Faces, we own our own chips nigga

[CF]
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

Repeat 1 to fadeWyclef:
Chickenheads, gobble, gobble
Thugs in the dance, no shootin', shootin', shootin'

Hook:
I cheated on you, you cheated on me
(to all the girls I cheated on before)
And this is not the way it's supposed to be
(It's a new year, I got a new change of gear, I swear)
So tell me girl, are you for real are you still down
I'm telling you, I have no time to fool around
(to all the girls I cheated on before)

Wyclef:
Hey yo, dear queen, by the the time you get this letter
It's 4 pages but my name ain't Aaliyah, what?
I don't know much about biology or chemistry
Failed the SAT's, study Brooklyn Zoo-ology
Remember me, Wyclef, the memory
Ectasy with no theory of manoghany
"To be or not to be", last words from Shakespeare
But a package says I wanna get rich with no fear
A few good men in the new millineam
Women got a new law, if you cheat you're a dead man
So I been dead like 100 times
Ask Cyndi Lauper, she'll tell you time after time
Like a virgin when I hit it for the very first time
She became a nymphomaniac and wanted it all the time
A thin line between love and lust
She mistake me for the rapper when I said "Can-I-Bus?"

Hook:
I cheated on you, you cheated on me

And this is not the way it's supposed to be

I'm telling you, I have no time to fool around
(to all the guys I cheated on before)

Queen Pen:
Yo, I checked for you since I was straight up strugglin'
Before your cousin Jerry put you on, when you was nothin'
So why you play me like I don't know jack ish
(Cause like K-Solo, your mom's in my business)
Now who you wanna play loco to mine
Feelin' kinda twisted, heard through the grapevine
That I'm doin' my thing, more more waiting
(I swear) Many a years and many a tears
I use chose remix to make it quite clear
That he came in when you didn't want to be there
And I fell victim to this one night affair
By the time weeks came you was already there
And still I come home just looking at you
See I'm feeling kinda guilty but revengeful too
All the dirt you done done, you don't know a clue
Why I don't sex you no more, and that's not coo'

Hook:
I cheated on you, you cheated on me
(to all the guys I cheated on before)
And this is not the way it's supposed to be
(It's a new year, I got a new change of gear, I swear)
So tell me girl, are you for real are you still down
I'm telling you, I have no time to fool around
(let me sum this all up)

Wyclef:
Yo, yo, yo, and yo from the college dorm and til the dusk is dawn
I never felt cold until I lost one
Don't let go like EnVogue chocked on
Clash of the titans, now I'm on my unicorn
I left New Jerus, I'm on my way to Brook-lawn
Someone hit my bumper, I turned around and saw Sharon
Got surprised because I saw little Shawn
In the passenger seat with a bottle of Dom
Remain calm, called Cocren on the horn
Salaam, call up the chief cause a murder 'bout to go on
What the bomb, bomb, but this ain't a reggea song
It's like a old flick "Godzilla Versus King Kong"
If you saw the movie than you know what's gonna happen
West coat, down south, back to Manhattan
Like Vanessa from "Soul Food" when she came at night, B
Thank God it was a dream cause I woke up with my wifey

Hook:
I cheated on you, you cheated on me
(to all the girls I cheated on before)
And this is not the way it's supposed to be
(It's a new year, I got a new change of gear, I swear)
So tell me girl, are you for real are you still down
I'm telling you, I have no time to fool around
(to all the girls I cheated on before)

Salaam Remi collabo, Wyclef Jean, Product, yeah, Queen Pen
9-8 'til infinitee, for all you girls out there I cheated on beforeYeah, so I guess by the time you get this kite, I'll be ghost, right?
Yup, check it

[Verse 1]
For too many years, I had yo back
And for too many years, you gave me slack
Tell me, what did you think
That I was a idiot?
Or, how many years you thought i'd take yo shit
I'm out, I'm leavin you wit the whips and the cribs
In exchange for the kids, and my happiness
Ghetto divorce, how real is this?
And oh yeah, tell you side bitch she _In Like Flint_
I left enough food to last until the weekends
And when its all gone, go eat wit your friends
Since thats, who you cherish, more then me
The one who carried every last one of your seeds
The one who did a bid for you when you copped one and three
The one who was on yo side when you copped yo first ki
Me and you kid, we was meant to be
Who'd think that the streets will make you flip on Queen

(Chorus: Repeat 2x, Miss Jones)
I'm doin my thang, I'm movin on
You won't appreciate a real bitch till shes gone
Never mind the drama and don't bother callin me
You'll never find a woman that looked out like me

[Verse 2]
For, many years concentrated on you
Lost focus on myself, seperated from my crew
Allowed you to drain down, my soul slowly
I'd rather be in the projects
Then stress and luxeries
So they're for I'm leavin you wit all yo ice
That shit wasn't worth bein alone at night
That shit wasn't worth worryin if you was alright
So ignorant, you never knew your wrongs from your rights
Never understood it was always about the respect
Not about bein yo main chick wit begettes on my neck
Not about bein me bein the baddest bitch in the hottest whip
It was about you bein a real man to me and yo kids, yo heard

(Chorus: Repeat 2x)
I'm doin my thang, I'm movin on
You won't appreciate a real bitch till shes gone
Never mind the drama and don't bother callin me
You'll never find a woman who looked out like me
I'm doin my thang, I'm movin on
You won't appreciate a real bitch till shes gone
Never mind the drama hang yo lame apology
You'll never find a woman who looked out like me

[Verse 3]
True I, made the choice to a wife to a thug
But you gotta understand, at first it was about the love
But now, I don't know who the fuck you are
I thought I never say "I miss"when the times was hard
When all I had was you, and you had me
Instead of pushin big boys, we was pushin our feets
I never shitted on you, stricly loyalty
I lived how you lived, by the codes of the streets
But you broke that son, when you flipped out on me
You'll never find another chick that'll hold you down like Queen
Never, another chick that'll help you grip yo bricks
Never, another chick will love you without yo chips
Tha'll ride up in a hooptie, as well as a six
You gon miss me when I'm gone
P.S. it was real kid

Uh huh, Miss Jones break it down
How you feel about this

[Chorus until fade](Intro)
Queen Pen: Me'shell Ndegeocello, play for me, c'mon talk to me
Me'shell: anyone know, it never ceases to amaze me how everbody's always in
Somebody else's buisness, looking for something, but 'cha know
For what it's worth - We could give a fuck!

(chorus)
Me'shell: Girlfriend, girlfriend, yes i had your girlfriend
Queen Pen: If that was your girlfriend, if that was your girlfriend
If that
Was your girlfriend, she wasn't last night  (x2)

(verse 1)
Now how you just gon' be playa hatin' on me
Coz i got mad bitches just wanting me
And i got mad niggas just checkin' for me see
I got more stock than you ever see, i be...
The one that your main squeeze been diggin
Pull you out your closet, sex on weekends
It's my buisness of what i do, him or her, he or she, inside you
So while you be yappin' and talkin to your friends
Beefin 'bout that yellow chicken, the green benz
I'll be havin' all your people's info with the second part of my ???
She slid the number, what you gettin mad at me for
She said she was single when she closed my car door

(chorus)

(verse 2)
Me'shell: so queen tell me, where did you meet her

Queen Pen: On the sunday, mac, she was walking out ???
I was just chillin, mindin my own business
Sittin on the corner, waitin for my sister
When she slid by, maybe 4 or 5 times
Wanted me to notice the rythm of her thighs
Oh boy, uh, girls are just so funny to me
I can see how niggas get into these beefs
She knew she had a man when she came up in the piece
She said she was a regular and how about me
If she gave me her digits would i call her after three
The way she fliked her hips made you move to have to see
How these chinese jamaican tried to draw it by me
It never ceases to amaze me

Me'shell: Ain't nobody gotta know just how much you want me

(chorus)

(verse 3)
Now how i've ran, you've only a few
But you can  back track and ask them how i do it how it is
Who the flyest chick, with the phattest whip
And run her all night, like a burger with a chip
And if it's all good then i feature it again
Like a fix remix, (if you need a fix)
See you gots to be real like my ex beverly
You don't have your man just stressin out on me
Coz he can't control how you throw your pussy
I'm a baller and i been for a ???
And if i choose to jerk her off then it's all on me
See you claimed that was your girl, well that's not how it seems
Uh, it never ceases to amaze me

Me'shell: Coz i like to get down so if you's wants ta i will
I love to love ya'  baby

(chorus)Intro/Chorus: 911

The girl was lookin good
Like a lady should
I remember where I saw her
I saw her in the magazine
Her body's tight, her fingers right
Reminds me of a girl from around the way
Ooooh oooh, I saw her in a magazine

Verse 1: Queen Pen, 911

Uhh, I heard you been lookin for me
Diggin me down, giving me nothin but peach
Ha please, you know where to find me when you need me
Queen P, got you charmed out like them trees
Or Lexus, heck a car load full of G's
Impress thee, wit the realism technique
Automatically, pulled you right into my lead
Feel me, as you indulge in your magazine

I couldn't believe my eyes
When I opened up that magazine
It was the finest girl I ever seen
I think I knew her face
I saw her hangin out around the way
Watchin all the players play, whoaaa
Her smile sets off this glow
And when she walks, it's such a sexy flow
I think I want to let her know, that
(She's a bad mamma jamma) Owowohhh
Just as fly as she can be, ohohowoh

Chorus

Verse 2: 911

I, often dream of us
And I can't believe it feels so real
It gives me such a freaky thrill
I like to hold her hand
And tell all the fellas I'm her man
But my dream came to an end
Now that she's on my mind
I just wanna make her mine
We'll be together til the end of time, ooooohhhhhh
(Yes I can make my dreams come true)
Then everything would be so cool
And I would never spend one night without you

Chorus

Bridge: 911

I can't explain, what she's done to me
So fine that it's a crime
Ooooh, I want her in my life
She's one of a kind
That girl, she blows my mind

Verse 3: Queen Pen

Uhh, ain't no need for awakening, cos you're not dreaming
I mean your optics be as clear like semen
It's me, squeaky clean, mentally and physically
I be's the one to weigh you down like a triple beam
Whore on the low low, never showin off like dem other hoes
I let my appearance show and prove
That's my motto, boo, styles of all types
So peel the lights and Pen, keeps it tight

Chorus: 911

The girl was lookin good
Like a lady should
I remember where I saw her
I saw her in the magazine
Smilin that day, she still looks good
Like she's got it goin on
Ooooh ooooh, I saw her in the magazineIntro:
Yeah, it's 97 going into 98
And I've been doin' this for mad years, payin' dues
This is my heart, my purpose in life
And finally I'm on
Which brings me to realise that the tough life that I had only made me
Stronger, ...TRUE

Chorus: Richard Stites
A ha ha ha ha
I know this much is true
A ha ha ha ha
I know this much is true

Verse One:
Growin' up didn't want to have nothing to do wit' you
Make you hittin' everybody went to high school wit' you
Wanna play you close and jump in the pool wit' you
I don't know what to do but this much is true
And in the hood, they all like to knock your career
And turn right around when you hot a gear
I played Midas and told them that it's God I fear
That the man upstairs, he control this here
And it's funny how, soon as the money piles
Everybody wanna play with that brother now
Run me down, but when the doe gets low, only a few friends roll, you know
And Mama, bless her heart, she used to give me strife
Said "Lynisse, please do something with your life"
And how it's gon' play out, I don't have a clue
All I know is this much is true, ...TRUE

Repeat Chorus:

Verse Two:
And I remember when, I used to feen for calls
When I hit number one I had to scream out calls
Used to see my Mama strugglin', worn from work
Told her when I made it big she never goin-a work
I used to wish at night that my brothers in the street
Hustlin', shit, they would live to the light
And see another day somehow, find another way I vow
To all my soldiers I hold you down
]From standin' in the rain to the rovers now
I'm screamin your name to warn you that the rollers is around
To on-stage throwin' it down
No matter where you at represent your hood
No matter where I'm at I'm representing my hood
And how it's gon' all play out I don't have a clue
All I know is this much is true, ...TRUE

Repeat Chorus:

Verse Three:
I've opened up my eyes to a brighter day
Nobody in the block gave their life away
We all tryin' to take it easily
And everybody wanna make it seems is free
Today it's all good and it seemes so strange
Since you look up in the hood now things done changed
Kids they used to be wheelies for blocks
Is out ridin' their bikes, doin' wheelies for blocks
And bitches on the bench, still gossipin', who's she slidin' in
Who's she slidin' with, outside partyin'
Old timers in the back playin' dominoes
Kids freestyling, all kinds of flows
Girls flow through with designer clothes
It's day now but you know how nightime goes
And how it's gon' play out I don't have a clue
All I know is this much is true... TRUE

	All that shit behind my desk is signed in checks

[Teddy Riley]
Do you like hits baby, got em goin crazy on BlackStreet
You know it's plaque time when me and the track meet
Save all your wack beats, Q.P. and T.R
So precise with mics we should be surgeons in E.R
The block knows (like that) baby girl be my diamond cause
She rocks shows (for Black) see my ones ain't no way that
You can stop those, Little Man got your breath together
With Queen Pen now it's hot to death, so take a look back (look back)
What I did, what I'm doin, where I take this (take that)
It's kind of simple cause a n*gga just make hits (make tracks)
Peep the facts, keep a stack, on the Streets of Black
Ladies scream he's the mack, cause

My chick, and plus funds just ridiculous

To account for alla dis sh*t, test we
And get your, block knocked off, UHH
You can keep yappin UNTIL YOU GET HOARSE
It don't matter, we don't, follow chit chatter

ASK SAINT NICK, about the repoitoire
For those in the past, they know who they are
If the shoe fits trust, WE GON WEAR IT
And we beez the baddest click up on this planet
We paid the cost to be boss G*d [damn it]
Cause scared don't win money, NOW DROP IT

Chorus (to fade)(Intro)
Uh, it's all for you, my melody boo
This lovin' is all for you, break it down, how you feel about this

Verse 1
Reminiscing to back in our beginning
Sweet politicing in the heart of the village
We slid digits on low, exchanged a couple of 'hellos'
As you slid out the door
I remember clearly makein' moves up the steps we made eye contact
It was his gleam that brought me back, ligit
How we met on some real ghetto star shit
Mad chicks on my melody's dick
See he got this kinda grace about himself
Dealin' with fast life all flooded up with wealth
So for him, cuties just be comin' like a dime a dozen
Smooth talkin' brothers always get easy fuckin'
But I ain't mad, at all of his cutie head lovin'
And all his playin hard to get was worth tryin' to get my lovin
He's got personality for days
The kinda melody others bad talkin' many ways
The kinda beat that always stays paid, my special kinda boo who always
Appreciates gettin' laid
My melody...

(sung)
Just the way. I wanna be loved
Yeah...

Verse 2
True, we been together from the very beginning
Since blocks be turned into states, baguettes be turned into cakes
So he be knowin' how I'm down by law
Plus his knowledge himself be havin' his mentality bore
He gets first bids when I'm blowin' in from tour
His sex is respected behind closed doors
Listen, he the bomb, I can't tell you different
It's a fact how he mistify me like Kaiser Sosack
Uh, it feels good to know how others wish they could be loved
In the clubs bitches screwin' up their mugs because
They envious to how my boo is true to this
Gold diggin' bitches always be disputing shit
That don't even concern them, I'm learnin'
The next chick that try to make your melody a B-track
But true, he be bigger than that
My boo be realisin' that his wifey'll always have his back, uh
...Check out my melody...

(sung)
Cause you love me baby....
Just the way I wanna be loved
Yeah...

Verse 3
Communication be never a mess
Coz he be keepin' street conflict away from this relationship
He's got a mind of his own
He's a leader, not scared to be a dreamer, my black man digger
And I be down till the day that I die, loyalty bonafied
So how ask why I, dedicated all my love to his cause
Financially lock him down, hide his monies from the law 'coz
No matter what my melody be's a good man
No m,atter how he ran on the actions of his plan and
I be down till the day that I die
Loyalty bonafied, my melody and I... uh

(sung)
'Coz you love me baby
Just the way I wanna be loved
Yeah... It's so nice lyin' here in you arms
Your personality has that charm

I run circles around you, verb'll straight serve you
Day to night we keep it tight like a girdle

Keep Queen Pen close to your ears like a bob

You know the program, let no man, interrupt your flow
And if that's your man, you better let him know

The way I be flowin is sick-sick-sick
Ice rope glowin, focus on the wrist, it takes
