[Verse 1: Planetary]
Yeah! Yo, uh
A lot of rappers try approaching the omen
My poems will punish your people while I’m up at the podium
Pharaohs folding 'em, like washed clothes again
I'm a vulture when the flow go choke your kin
Broke, I leave most of them, slow, I keep my motionin'
Eye on the prize
I silence the wise, my lyrics make a scientist cry
Making a secret society expose their purpose
Making 'em unleash info and explode in my surface
I'm taking my time to birth this, rap entity earthless
It's show time, there's no time, be ready when the curtain split
I'm hurtin' shit, too powerful for painkillers
On the concrete jungle we walk like trained guerillas
Untamed, and my niggas is Kane, Kool G, Rakim, combined into one frame
We like the new mecca of immaculate rappers
Vinnie Paz, call the goons, now we back with the clappers

[Verse 2: Chief Kamachi]
Yo, remain silent, kill him with what I mentally says
Bloody Fez, choke you like an Indian rez
Kamach, animal Turk, sick with a cannibal smirk
Welcome, this where the murderers lurk
It's my mind, that make sure that the Sun can work
Scorch bodies, leave all of your gunmen hurt
Pharaoh sultans, create a serious cult jam
And my hand is where the tears of the pope ran
They stay watching like they keep me on a scope cam
I'm in Heaven with the angels that smoke grams
You need God, that's why the earth so damned
International, trying to get my flow banned
That's cool, if I don't kick these prayers
A lot of floods and fam' is gonna hit these years
Kamachi back on the chapel stairs
Open the clouds, let the thunder clap your ears

[Verse 3: King Syze]
You wanna put your money up? Then muthafucker then put it
For your family's sanity man, I wish that you wouldn't
Niggas got nice flows, just dont know where to put it
And I know your whole life your raps are edited footage
And y'all mixtape niggas couldn't see my plateaus
All up in my presence, while y'all actin' bashful
King Syze casting an ecliptic rap flow
Y'all little light niggas couldn't feed my shadows
From, city to city, intersection to section
But you reflexin', with or without a weapon
I'm always steppin', never scared
But always and forever prepared
Yeah the ones who drink gas man is revvin' their gears

[Verse 4: Reef the Lost Cauze]
You now rocking' with the foulest clique in the continent
Total dominance, rise to prominence
In my prime like Optimus, stand in astonishment
At this conglomerate, an axis of evil
I know where Osama is, he down in Camp David
Down and dirty like a damp basement
The champ must demand greatness
From himself, or be another contender
There's hundreds of niggas
Dead left under the river
From the days of slaves
To hurricanes in Orleans
See my people's graves floatin' amongst the waves
There's hell to pay, but
The devil don't take checks
I tried to send a message to God
His phone don't take texts
I need a new plan, a crook with knowledge
Times is hard homie, why I took them dollars
Man, my momma got a mortgage
And my little baby sister need books for college
I rob all of y'all

[Verse 5: Doap Nixon]
Hey, yo, they want the hood in here so they called me first
I give 'em rappers gatorade cause they ball with thirst, UH!
This is more than music
But these niggas is mad trash
That's why the stores refuse 'em
Yo, I'm out in Georgia, went straight to the block
I'm seein' cats motorcyclin' dawg, I'm doin the walk
I'm an O.G., call my Italian niggas a wop
Though their papers ain't right, but they got weight on the block
I love 'em uh
Hand to hand, see your hands ache
I drunk so much syrup dawg I stopped eatin' pancakes
Ya niggas cool dawg mine's absurd hot
Stop frontin' like you's a killer money, your nerves shot
Yo you's a Paxil nigga, dumpin' Zoloft in coffee
AOTP what exhaust be
Can't keep it gear, cause I'm blinging with F's
But I got my mind right so swing your shit to the left

[Verse 6: Demoz]
Nigga if I had 24 hours to live
Fuck 24 hours, gimme 24 seconds
Vin I'm drivin' off a bridge
Broken rib, no windshield, covered in kerosene
Gasoline tank filled to the top
Magazines of these phony rappers ripped in pieces
No priest is, strong enough to take me out of my zone
I broke Jesus, choke niggas who squeal
Rob niggas who steal, kill niggas who kill
I'm too sick for a pill
Man these niggas ain't real, they real fake
They say they a man but they fuckin' reveal snakes
That's when you put 'em in a truck with their grill taped
Rip in reverse then run into a steel gate
I'm a suicide driver, never been a liar
If I don't kill you later, I'mma kill you Mañana
You don't want no problems
You don't want no drama
Nigga I'mma take a trip with your baby momma, suicide driver

[Verse 7: Celph Titled]
Ya better cross your T's
Cause we'll dot your eyes
You can say that you specialize but pharaohs will optimize
Backstage will get a bitch back smacked there
The mac glare like dirty south pimp slap clap snares, YEAH!
Holy paragraphs, what kind of shit is that?
I'm Jesus in the flesh so this is motherfuckin' Christian rap
Y'all just Christmas wrap, must be the secret Santa
My reindeer aim near, pierce you with the antlers
I made 'em go easy, and called off the wolves on my AOTP radio CB
Cause y'all ain't worthy of grenades and RPGs
Slit throat, hope you float with sardines and seaweed
Cause this is C-E-L-P-H demonic symphony
Listen to the hell we make
And a year before your kids tenth birthday came
You didn't have to wait for candles on the cake to see the nine flame

[Verse 8: Vinnie Paz]
Respect a G, my clique clap at you incessantly
I lay back and drink alcohol excessively
It ain't a rapper that's alive today that's testing me
I got degrees in being ignorant and weaponry
A 40 oz and Dutch Master is the recipe
That's my shit there, that'll be the death of me
Give me a death mask, better yet an effigy
I understand the math of death and it's complexity
I understand how you was violently murked
I understand how you was raised under the lies of the church
But understand and recognize that I'm cursed
With the ability to end your fucking lives with a verse[Intro: Sample]
Back to the hardcore!

[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
Intelligent infinity,malevolent epitome
They consider me as the most deadly weapon from Italy
That will include the Benelli semi-auto artillery
Literally cryogenically treated to be invisibly
Symphony slicker than sixty Sicilianos from Sicily
Motherfuckers talking but never going to do shit to me
I'm about to set it on motherfuckers officially
Rip they spine out and just put them out of they misery
No more mister nice guy, everything maliciously
Who can stop me now you with Luca Brasi where fishes be
It's impossible that you're righteous without the dignity
If it's a problem you motherfuckers can come and visit me

[Verse 2: Planetary]
Super humanity gradually back from my galaxy
Burning them calories I'm still yearning to earn a salary
The son of anarchy I'm in court pleading insanity
Can it be all the panicking and agony that's trapping me, tragically Introducing you rappers to tragedy
Happily ever after if after means you a casualty
Praise those who savagely sacrifice their reality
Bury bones and annually dig them up unhappily
Catch me flossing dead in the center of gravity
Bonafide, a mix of Maxi Priest and the Maccabees
My mentality, manipulating your mastery
The master, disaster strikes whatever's in back of me

[Verse 3: Esoteric]
Playtime is over, day time is over
The finest soldiers, take nines from holsters
My only weapons: canines and cobras, we diamond poachers
We take your shine, we some mind controllers
My rhyme is solar-flaring, airing out the kind below us
You know Lois Lane know my name
I'm throwing flames at your brain like Ghost Rider, my flow's tighter
I'm Blakey Griffin with an open lane
My foe is Bane, my flow is Betsy Ross off the Zoloft: so insane
I'm over-trained in hand-to-hand and man-to-man my hammers land and can ya fam
I'm a brutal rapper, you're a Chutes & Ladders
Candyland emcee,I'm completely AOTP 'til the death
Esoteric zombie-killer taking out whatever's left

[Hook]
You're mad cause the army's here
Top to bottom, army gear
Gunshots is all you hear
Death come to all who's near
We're running through the village killing
Building a regime
Heavy unstoppable
Crown of thorns form we ready

[Sample]
When playtime's over I'll take your mind back to the hardcore

[Verse 4: Apathy]
The God particle, armageddon weapons in my arsenal
I'm the real deal, fuck an Alex Jones article
Heart is arctic cold, my murder's are nautical
Murk you in the murky depths, where the screams aren't audible
Salutations, standing over the body salivating
Was kicked out of Hell cause I wouldn't bow to Satan
I'm the Boss, I turn your albums off
I turn your brain to apple sauce, my wingspan is like an Albatross
Out the frost, mouth spewing out exhaust out come the claws
Power force, that can blow the tops of mountains off
Blow the head of cowards off, you'll get carried off
Y'all are soft as farries buried in terrycloth

[Verse 5: Celph Titled]
In '94 I dreamt of spreading Salt-n-Pepa's legs
But I was busy playing dodgeball with severed heads
Conducting chaos with a chrome baton
So sound the smoke alarm
Cause overall I broke your arms
And kicked your ass with loafers on
Homeboy this HK settle wars
I'm a dragon, you're a faggot with a tape measure sword
Celph Titled is a motherfucking problem
With germs that are infectious
Attack like German shepherds while acid dissolve 'em
I got the ratchet -I blast it
You got a ratchet, but you keep it in your jacket
Undercover brother on your album cover trying to look like you crazy
When your theme song should be Aerosmith, "Dude looks like a lady"

[Hook][Intro]
It is said that once an entire army marched against him...a real army

[Verse 1: Planetary]
One-two, one-two
Pharaoh shit, nigga!
Yo, I live life according to the Low End Theory
A champion, the trophy goes to me clearly
Most of these niggas fear me seriously
I'm a step above God, my apostles cheer me
Tap if you hear the Desert Eagle spittin'
With a Buhloone Mindstate I start Ego Trippin'
Back in the lab I'm the mad scientist
Keep ya eye on this, when I roar I'm lionesque, yes!
Untamed, my style is mundane, consumed from the moon
Until the sun done changed
Done done, I done came, conquered my insanity
The man in me evolves to my vanity
All black tee, Philly fitted with a black P
Niggas ain't ready for war to blast me, B
Ask me if I give two shits, if you ain't Pharaohs, QD
My kids or my bitch

[Verse 2: Esoteric]
E.S. I made the track rap your dome
We uncanny like David and Manny
You chasin' balls, out in left, while I'm circlin' third and being waved home
Murderin' herbs, reveal words to your nose bone
I'm Larry Holmes with a left and a right
I'm Roy Jones winning fights on consecutive nights
I'm Luke Sky with the blast shield down, cats kneel down
This is boom-bap, real rap, steel sounds
I watch NESN at seven
I watch the news at eleven to look for MC's
I lyrically murdered and the bodies that I deserted
They probably didn't deserve it, but I had to do it to them, I gotta pride of lions
That love whack rapper meat, so I throw it to 'em
The Mighty Thor with the mind of Michael Moore
This type of war ends games like the final score

[Verse 3: Celph Titled]
Yeah! Celph Titled!
I can't see y'all from where I'm at
I like the smell of napalm in the morning while I'm eating my Apple Jacks
My battle axe acts as a last resort death kill
Quarantine your city, it's about to be a lead spill
Faggots better (Fall back!) Said I ain't got (Raw raps!)
Fuck made you (Doubt that!) Fuck boy (I'm all that!)
Arrows with explosive tips
I'm about to get real ill on some Ill Bill on Coka Nostra shit
That's gritty and gangsta, Vinnie, pass me a banger
I'll abort you little sports with a rusty hanger
Parker Brothers say my name, y'all start to stutter
Slicin' pussies, I'm a certified carpet cutter
Handgun: Automatic! Shotgun: Pump-action!
Me with your wife, that's automatic pump-action!
Laundromat thug passion, we wash bundles there
Keep a gun tucked in a motherfuckin' Snuggles bear[Intro]
"But the Thesselonian you're fighting...
He's the biggest man I've ever seen. I wouldn't want to fight him."
"That's why no one will remember your name."

[Apathy]
We the poisonous boys in the hood
Poised to deploy you, destroy alien barbarians ragin' on 'roids
We the '89 Raiders, Bo Jackson in your radius
The eighth wonder space hunter, Godless and atheist
Decepticon cannibals eating metal and chemicals
A robotic vampire fangs sinking into wires
Rowdy in the Audi, smoke pouring from the tires
To burn my kingdom you must use nuclear weapons
White kids started studying lessons
But with devils in the mental can't see our reflections
Cut my way out the womb, homemade c-section
(Man you fucked up)
What would give you that impression?

[King Magnetic]
I'm known for rushing in, tuck your chin
Knuckles friend, suck it in, cut your kin, puncture skin
Stuck up in the muck again
I'm bucking till they dug up in their motherfucking trunk again
Let 'em run up on them every witness that wasn't there
I'll fuck up your teeth like cheap fronts
Vegan caterers, niggas never handled beef once
Nope, tofu to soul food, the vocal choke you
Now you can't feel me, you're not supposed to
I'm close to the edge mezzanine melodies
Steadily ready to stab like the riff from the melody
Telling me different I'm felony riffing
Melons be dripping, temper wild, Melanie Griffin
Stiffing your body from lifting the shottie, vision of Gotti
Living is property, visual sodomy
Prison lobotomy, the wrong people in your head now
Jail dudes stand up, the king like a head count

[Esoteric]
I'm an animal activist, dog I'm far from a hunter
So Sarah Palin be the only cougar I put a gun to
What type of spell am I under? You want a beef? Take a number
I wonder why these younger rappers won't acknowledge their blunders
I got unquenchable hunger, my stomach rumbles like thunder
A real Jedi kid, you a toy Yoda like Tundra
You a scene out the movie 8 Mile, studio puncher
Run to the litter, spit a quitter bullshitter
I'm the definition of driven, the prisoners have arisen
With visions of demolition and fission through ammunition
I'm wishing cannibalism was a family tradition
I eradicate your groups over Gladiator loops, listen

[Celph Titled]
You think you can beat me with ether?
When I'm cooking something fresh and y'all reheating pizza
The Intertec make you move like doo-wop dancers
I'm slicker, bust the blicker, then I moonwalk backwards
You gonna see clouds but no it ain't the DreamWorks intro
Fire and brimstone in each verse tenfold
You thought I was ill?
I'm ten googolplexes times that
My raps are phone calls from Hell so star-69 that
You an actual queer, we put a rapper in a bungee sling
Dunny, we catapulting careers
The world's most dangerous MC and I'm him
C-dot Title, I'm liable to be a problem
Your album sells like clothes at a nudist club
It's the dude you love that had that line about that Krueger glove
Yeah, so feel the hurricane force when I murder
My main course is Main Source, Barbeque flame sauce[Intro: Vinnie Paz]
Hahahaha…
Yeah, muthafuckas! We’re back!
Pharaoh clique, muthafucka! Yeah!
Des Devious! (King Syze!)
Apathy! Celph Titled! (Kamachi!)
Vinnie P.! Outerspace!
7L, ES!

[Apathy]
I put you up on the IV, not the Roman Numeral 4
But the IV that leads to the funeral floor
Wax gets melted; breaks bones, fractures pelvis
Speeds through space and cracks glass Astronaut helmets
Face it, motherfucker I can pay to get rid of you
I've got more heads in the hood than Pagan rituals
A new tyrannical force for you to fear
Known to kill and keep human ears as souvenirs
A shape shifter face slitter, paper getter
Tape your sister, rape your sister
Make your sister take it in the face
And if you're facing us, block off a 30 block radius
I throw more blows than boxing Dr. Octavius

[King Syze]
Ever since we made some noise I learned people love a winner
We the quality of deep dish rims, y'all the hub spinners
Tough sinners, break bread with Jesus at dinner
Protected by a heavenly force, fuck a minister
Niggas know better, no one's letter is better than mine
Everytime I rhyme, it's metal; the terror level is high
Plus I testify, it's best you die
Then find the truth deep down in a mountain of lies
Downsize, I'm ousting you guys deep in the dirt
Clocking in and out of rap, have y'all fiending for work
When I breed it, yo it's treason what the semen is worth
Non-believing, make me steaming, make you meeting the earth

[Crypt the Warchild]
Ayo it's my world and I won't stop
And if you stand in my way you bound to get popped
In the land where you lay, invade from straight shots
I demand that you pay and stray from straight blocks
I'm the man that you pray, don't spray the flames hot
I could tan in the blaze for days and stain cops
I astound and amaze, y'all praise the same god
I'm a pound out your brain and scrape the graveyard
Have you shout out in pain, y'all say y'all bravehearts
I'm a box up your frame and play the same card
And I'm out for fame, spacebars and quasars
Pharoahs locked the game, no shame, we hate y'all

[Vinnie Paz]
Yeah! Raw muthafuckin rap! Hardcore shit! Ninety four shit
Shoot the fuckin place up, yeah!

[Des Devious]
AOTP blast through your army fatigues
Damage your team, competition done it with ease
Gun in my sleeve cause now a days homicide is my steez
Collecting my cream, I'm living your dream and peeping your scheme
Put you on lean from right hooks, pausing your jux
You fake crooks need to hit them books
Learn the rules of the game
Two to your brain, three to your frame, incredible pain
You getting drenched in that November rain
We the opposite of that whack shit
Trash man of clap rapping, you die, trash it
Five six professional assassins
Rocking these mics and repping my fam' with passion
Remember its Q-Dement', you bastards

[Esoteric]
Tell your man and your parents
We be demandin' ten grand an appearance
At a minimum my venom damage your lyrics
We be like Manny Ramirez, comes out in fall
With the radical, magical, and emphatical
I'mma battle till I shatter your clavicle
Call me admiral, raising the temp of the room
I'm the emperor, remember I never surrender, I dismember platoons
Your petty men are bufoons
We send 'em to their doom the second my venom enters their wounds
I mentally bloom, exhume tombs with dope lyrics
2Pac's alive and well, Big L 'The Devil's Son' rise from hell with those lyrics
Live in regret, AOTP these shook rappers hit the deck

[Chief Kamachi]
Courtesy of the streets, make it a microphone Middle East
My specialty, only rhymer enveloping my lyric sheets
Knock turbans off of sheiks
Use a pipe bomb
Downtown Israeli boutiques full of dead tourists
With they dreams no longer in arms' reach
That's what I call 'dealing with calm speech'
When I alarm your peeps
Inscribed in a peasant's palm is a blessed psalm
If you draw and your weapons wrong, there ain't no stepping on
My forty-five is my weapon
My culture's a holster with seven inch slugs is kept in
Squarely I step in, tilting my clips and blue Stetson
God is my essence, and you could check these rhymes for reference
Adept to any preference, pussy

[Vinnie Paz]
Yeah baby, kings of the motherfuckin' underground
Y'all motherfuckers don't want it with us. This that raw shit, throwback shit

[Celph Titled]
I make Evil Knievel music
I come through stunting
Every verse is the same, just flipped a little something-something
Baby I'm crazy, a crazy baby, a sick infant
Born with an intent to spit slick sentences with sick penmanship
Shoot at your Chicago fitted and knock your socks off
Aimed at your door but hit your head, shot your locks off
I heard you was afraid to say my name on your record
Cause you's afraid I'd put your motherfucking frame on a stretcher
I can't change laws sons, that's a government issue
But I'll break laws with a gun, that's a government issue
It's the Army, we got power in numbers
And that's nines, forty-fives, three-five-sevens, and M500s

[Planetary]
Some people say I'm superior when I shit it
Vivid visionary spit, vocabulary ridiculous
I am a tyrant, I'm Violent by Design
I silence the scientific with every line of the rhyme
Mozart of street rap, breaking the barriers
Space harrier filled with forties and pit terriers
Ready to mangle, anybody crossing the line
I saw the sign and ran with the army, lost in time
Ready for war but won't rock no dick trees
I rock mic's, you think it's a hundred and sixty degrees
Who stomp crews, batter and bruise cliques
Kill bitches and stab you tricks with loose lips

[Vinnie Paz]
I'm slightly disturbed, Pazienza is nice with the words
That's the reason that I'm fly like the life of a bird
I don't care if you're dead, let god have ya
Cause I'mma stay rugged and raw like Marv Hagler
That's something you don't know about me small rapper
Nice with the left, nice with the right, the jaw tapper
Allah backer, murder every track that I'm on
You just spit a fucking verse whack then you're gone
Fuck fame, I study the fame closely
They build you up, then you get rocked like Shane Mosley
It's pain homie, and your blood on my pen
It's Army of the Pharoahs and we're flooded with gems[Intro - Bizarre]
Reel Wolf, underground shit
I guess I'm up first, right?
I'mma rap first?
Alright, let me hit this blunt right quick

[Verse 1 - Bizarre]
I'm the sickest motherfucker on this earth
That'll fuck a transvestite, dog, or blue Smurf
Bizarre smack a bitch quick
Then give her ass and lick while she take a shit
Fuck your period, fuck your rag
Take it in your ass, just like a fag
All my fans is crazy, they love it
That's why I say fuck it, and smack you in public
I'm rugged!

[Verse 2 - Reef the Lost Cauze]
Yeah, you know me well
The Gods said that they owe me hell
I'm The Outlaw Josey Wales
I make a nigga feel spiritual like holy tales
From the bible, roll Exodus and then inhale
No one knows you, so if I kill you who’d I tell?
Half-hipster, whiney nigga that’s a fuckin' fail
Life without purpose, that’s a fucking jail
Lost Cauze, when I spit it’s fucking hell

[Verse 3 - Ill Bill]
Master a dance of lesbians
Satanic majesty's equestrian
On a black steed stampeding pedestrians
'Do what thou willt' shall be the whole of the law
I get my dick sucked by a nun with the soul of a whore
Superstitious like a gypsy casting a death-spell
Exhale chem-trails
Strangle you with your own entrails
14th day of July innocence was averted
Ill Bill, born on the same day Billy The Kid was murdered

[Verse 4 - Slaine]
It's kill or be killed
So watch out for the villain - he's ill
I'm slinging rap, swinging bats like I'm in little league still
Sniffing cocaine off a coin with Kennedy's grill
Cough from a joint while I'm crushing my enemies will
I'm a homicidal Hercules, doggie, I'm an urban myth
I swerve the whip, get my dick sucked while on my work release
I give these rappers bad advice and a nervous twitch
Penetrate and innovate, a renegade, I murder shit

[Hook]
I'm a real wolf
With the Underworld flick

[Verse 5 - Celph Titled]
I ain't racist just cause I split your head to the white meat
The missing link Yeti-Sasquatch, yeah I might be
This shit's real - distribute guns in the kids meal
Open the box, hold the Glock, bust a shot through the windshield
The manifestation of evil stay alive and breathing
I'm Satan's fitness trainer, exercising demons
Respect the shooter, I'll find the bastard
Hell, my loaded pistol is a fire hazard

[Verse 6 - King Gordy]
My dick stays hard in graveyards, you pray hard
As I make love to Adolf Hitler’s carcass
Call me a nigger as I lick his heartless chest
I guess these skinhead Nazis wanna get retarded
Why? Cuz I’m fucking your leader all in his ass
Speak to him in Hebrew, fuck the Führer until he's back, dead again
Tell the Aryans I’m burying my head right in his belly
And it’s scary cause I'm licking his mustache

[Verse 7 - Sid]
Son of a killer, Mr. fucking grimey
SAS 22nd regiment limey
Born in a bar with my eyes wide open
Inspired by debacles since I came out the fallopian
We don't fuck around, got permits to carry
Everybody walks around like Dirty fucking Harry
Don't play my town, cause we will fucking bury you
Carry you to a farm cut off your arms, chewed up by animals

[Verse 8 - PMD]
On your mark, get set, ready to go
Green light, checkered flag, time to get that dough
And ayo, in the underworld I'm half-wolf and half-lycan
Swing the Excalibur, barbaric viking

[Verse 9 - Sean Strange]
Vicodin, marijuana, cocaine, the Grateful Dead
Average rapper kidnapping
Be sure to make your bed
When they battle me fatality take your head
And write a rhyme with your blood
The page's painted red

[Hook]

[Verse 10 - Apathy]
I'm the king of Castle Greyskull
My grey matter's powerful as Grey Hulk
I’m Zartan, I’m Tarzan before he went to Greystroke
My brain's broke, slang dope
And when I speak, my slang's dope
You're soft as fuck - your whole album is a gay joke
Rap's lethal, spit a sixteen at you
We'll paint the ceiling with your brains
Like the Sistine Chapel
I'm the cardinal of carnage, the poisonous priest
Don't bother praying to your God
There's no avoiding this beast

[Verse 11 - Swifty McVay]
You ain't about that life
You a bastard that won't attack
I'm the type to grab a knife
And I'm stabbing you with it backwards
I'm backslapping wack ass non-rappers
Snatch the breath out of you faster than asthma without a gas mask
I lace hash, a heinous figure
Slash-murderer, I'm burning these legacy killers
Putting mo' metal in niggas than robotic mechanisms
Kill his woman and brag about it in prison

[Verse 12 - Vinnie Paz]
Rambo-knife, show you what bloody is
You call it a dead cop, I call it a bloody pig
You think your hands nice money? You's a funny kid
You next to get molly-whopped like your buddy did
The Ruger Blackhawk, stick it in the dunny rib
Throw him in the fucking bathroom like Sunny did
The biggest show in your career; like a hundred kids
The AR-15 blew off like a hundred wigs

[Verse 13 - Tech N9ne]
Grim reaper to Ariel Castro, Adam Lanza, James Holmes
Flame on, no it ain't wrong when I'mma have them plans for cancer
Then land ya in a hands up tense panthers
Damned with antlers to ram ya man pampers
Scrams the answer, No evil understands ya
Grandeur and like you were three times the word lambda
I’ll be the damper on a clan’s fam camper
Necromancer drinking vodka and Fanta with Santa

[Hook][Verse 1: Apathy]
I travel underground like the Goonies with a bag full of uzis
Emerging in a corner store where Arabs sell loosies
My banger's on the waist, I never wave it around
But I always chamber a round when there's strangers around
Set my phaser to kill, my force field is on max
Never relax, study the facts and stockpile gats
Cause the sky's about to bleed blood out from the clouds
This gas mask's in my backpack when walking through crowds
The post-apocalyptic, optic fitted with bionic circuitry
Surgically planted perfectly, no way to word it verbally
But extrasensory perception got me detecting
Any cop or detective, intercept them, and stop 'em with weapons

[Verse 2: King Syze]
King Syze, Vinnie Paz, we like Animal Hawk
Grammatical master for art, Heavy Metal we smashing your thoughts
We upper level, you rappers are technicians
Undergraduates I gotta doctorate when it comes to ripping
Scientific, I was spawned from a different species
And if you beat me, you gon’ fight me every time you see me
It’s never over, fuck Syze it's King Cobra
I’m brushing off my shoulders, spittin lethal plus we taking over
I’m getting older so I live by the new slogan
That Philly shit the barrel smoke will leave your head open
IIt’s open season on any rapper who want to beef with
The Army of the Pharaohs, yeah man we’ll bring the seasoning

[Verse 3: Crypt the Warchild]
Don't hit me with the drama, don't approach me 'bout no B.I
Cause I'm a Pharaoh king, and y'all ain't worthy of a reply
Bodies I've caught decomposing on the seaside
Catch me river dancing through the bloody waters, knee-high
Mind state is cutthroat, can't walk around deprived
My team shut it down, any access will be denied
Crown royal status Puerto-Ricans, that's how we ride
Nocturnal souls mesmerized by the streetlights
One shot at glory, game will never give you three tries
For the haters I've murked, they would love to see me die
Acid tripping vision, everything look hi-defy
Drugs, money, liquor, only things that get me by

[Verse 4: Jus Allah]
I got a lot of hate, I got to learn to love, stop the date
But some days I would rather murder than populate
Either way, I gotta open up the cosmic gates
Who knows what the future holds, gotta watch and wait
I can't function clear, keep a ton of guns and beer
I never sweat it, I get arrested like once a year
My gun big as two guns, you should cover your ears
Believe half of what you see and nothing you hear
Nobody listens, I got a lot of ground to cover
Bullets go in one ear and out the other
Tucked the weapon in, kick his face
In the blood pool like give him a taste of his own medicine

[Verse 5: Esoteric]
Impeach the president, I’m pulling out my ray-gun
Chuck D’s greatest line and y'all ain’t even thank him
Y'all ain’t on my radar, horrible like Hagar
Mos Eisleys flow, beats banging on the space bar
Haters get mad, start banging on the spacebar
Flip over the desk, ought to take it up with HR
Your bitch give Bad Brains, like she work for H.R
I be where the rays are, you wonder where the weights are
I’m a cannibal, you cats wonder where the plates are
I know that I’m immortal why you wonder where the gates are
I Cold Crush your Brother like Grandmaster Caz
Paz work with the .45 like Lakim Shabazz

[Verse 6: Blacastan]
I’m from the East Coast nigga, but I’m still loc'ed out
I grew up inside the crack-house, my moms was smoked out
You know the kid with the bummy kicks, holes in his jeans
Same shirt, chilling on some bummy shit
Yeah, that was me though, attracted to the metal like Magneto
Sneakers started talking like ay bandito
Got my own never borrowed or begged for shit
Now it's on cause I'm rolling with the Pharaohs legit
Tired of rappers always rhyming that bullshit
Catch at you at your CD signing, with a full clip
Now, how you feel about the Pharaohs and the Demigodz?
That’s what I thought nigga, because we large and in charge

[Verse 7: Celph Titled]
Keep shooters on stash, move and they blast
Refugees that came on an inner tube with a gat
Rubix Cuban code name, but you will respect the handle
Spend checks on Windex so I shine the chrome enamel
I throw hands with the devil so ain't much to fear after
Bitches cry over me, I'm a top tier rapper
American Idol with a wet wipe for you Desperate Housewives
Firecracker go off from my brick, the whole house white
And I will outright say that you soft
I write your favorite writer that you base your style off of
I'll let the Tec blast in ya, if the check cash finish
Shells give you a turtle-face, make ya back splinter

[Verse 8: Planetary]
With the semi-automatic, sipping henny in the attic
Spitting heavy with the god of the Serengeti blasted
Fasted, ‘till I downloaded the attachment
The hunger came back, and I’m eating like a savage
Walking through the labyrinth, imagining it’s Nazareth
Throwing more stones at the throne, lone catalyst
Puff puff pass it, that ain't ever been me
Only had the urge to annihilate the emcee
Used to ride the ten-speed, and copped the top ten sneaks
Never thought I’d be in Budapest counting ten Gs
But it all makes sense to me
Pharaoh clique sick man we thick more than ten feet

[Verse 9: Vinnie Paz]
If I ain’t heard of y'all rappers then you gotta be soft
That’s the reason why I talk about the bodies I caught
Bodies in north, New Haven down to New York
If it’s a fight they put in front of me, it’s gotta be fought
They got me in court for carrying the burner on the waist
My lawyer is an animal, he murdering the case
Boombox hardbody murdering the tape
I'll take your fucking heart like a burglar on a date
I’m magic with the four-fifth, perfect with the eight
I lavish with the lyricals, superlatives is great
Mash a motherfucker out, tourniquet his face
Jheri-head rappers ain’t assertive as the great, yeah      [Tonedeff]
Yo, first I sprinkle the verse
By addin' words, rhymes
Flippin 'em in a verse with lines
Then I'mma hit 'em disperse rhyme
Venom and then I'mma split 'em in half
Feelin' my wrath
Venturin' through parts of the South so dirty
You'll want to be given a bath
It's livin' a pathological lie to deny that I'm nice
And the truth hurts (ow)
Wearin' a blue shirt the best buy for the price
To get six guys this live and nice on the mic
So don't diss us because we're fly
Until you try what it's like
I'm liable to slice at these emcee bastards
Leaving their knees fractured
Needin' every piece of their teeth re-crafted [Do it to 'em]
So don't front cause I see past it
You're harmless like Wolverine's adamantium claws
When they're retracted [ching*]
If the scene's backlit
Or seems static, we'll wreak havoc
We'll beat batter to keep rappin'
A leech battle, a dream shatterer
For three nanoseconds [damn]
Count your paces, one step to Tonedeff
You're Gone in Sixty Seconds like Nicholas Cage is

[Deacon]
I'll leave you riddled with basics
There's no need for complexity
To be beside myself I need God next to me
Just kiddin'
I'm partially bullshittin'
The only time I take a loss pussy is when I lose kittens
I pitch shit past 'ya, no matter who's hittin'
I don't capsize boats
But I got crews flippin'
You catch it? The message needs analyzation
Step and your boys'll be pouring alcoholic libations
I flew sick, you knew this
I'll puzzle you, doofus
Fuck mentally
Stretch you into a physical Rubik's
It'll take more than sticker rearrangement to change it
His language is so strange, how do we contain it?
You can't just paint this up upon the canvas
Gotta get the mental picture
To begin to understand this
So anticipate defeat, delete chances
Got your heads speared on lances
Doin' burial dances [It's over]

[Sankofa]
I'm givin' body language speech impediments
Each other threat causes confident cats to stutter-step
Gutter reputation down to a size
Too raw for porn overdubs, plate of leftovers
Eat some warmed-over thugs
A jaded wordsmith
Bleeding ghostwriters' pens dry
Get on other rappers' nerves
Corroding dendrites
When my thoughts connect
You ought to step away fast
It seems I gave cats "hey that's the way they make tracks" {?}
Forget a scare, I'm not generous, kid
Spit society of Nim and it didn't enlist {?}
Independently sick
And this is just a quick reminder
If you was to pick a cipher
Then I'll bus you quick to Rikers
All expenses paid, no questions asked
Talk ghetto in the cut and we'll leave your flesh all gashed
Can't relax, man, the last time I took a breather
I got brought up on murder charges
Start the crooked fever

[Kno]
Hey yo, I'm not the fella to riff with
I'm so nice Mr. Rogers sued my ass
For copyright infringement
Roll with henchmen
That will switch heads
From wanna be thugs to 24/7 bitch kids
Topping my shitlist
Producting cat bastards wantin' jiggy beats
For some wack rappers
Switch my style? Who you tryin'a play?
My beats'll maraud yo' ass any time of day
Like Deuce Bigalow's chick
Whenever you do shit
People see you and holler "That's one huge bitch!"
Shit, when the LP rolls out
The Source'll be forced to make the quotables
A three-page fold-out
No doubt, I'm fed up with this wack shit
Bombin' the next kid wearin' Abercrombie and Fitch
And any jiggy rapper actin' fly on the radio's
Gettin' pulled out of rotation like a Firestone radial

[Kashal Tee]
Kashal Tee, the hip hop scene I phatten
Not even my winner's belt keeps my jeans from saggin'
It seems I'm braggin'
But fiends been naggin' for my next release
I apply all my expertise and make 'em extra pleased
Even get the vexed appeased, I make any brother feel this
All I do is independent, like double helix
Sellin' out? Well I hope that you're not
But how else could you afford all the soap that you drop?
You can't fuck wit me, yo, kid, look
Takin' me out ain't no small feat, you ain't Bigfoot
You should know who the heck you're facin'
Cause my reputation leaves no room for speculation
Now battle, is that you want to do?
What kind of man are you?
I bet you sit on the urinal too
Now that it's proven to you
They got a lot to tell us
NIMH got your heart skippin' beats like acapellas

[Celph-titled]
I be a cryptic author
Writing poems on tombstones
Celph-Titled, the nigga you couldn't bring home [Who's that?]
I'm at the crib wit your bitch givin' me slow head
Split you up in more pieces than when Jesus broke bread
My clique is raw, be prepared when you meet us
Kill an unborn baby and you still couldn't de-fetus (ooh)
I don't battle with rhymes
I'd rather battle with nines
Instead of using my mind
I'd rather shatter your spine
The closest you ever came to a punch line
Was waitin' for refreshments at the prom in '89
I'm super crafty, super nasty, super raspy
Fuckin' bitches with super asscheeks
You fucking faggots don't know what raw speech is
I beat a bitch until her whole body turn to cleavage
I'm hyperactive so I drink decaffinated
My left jab is fatal, leavin' cats decapitated[Apathy]
Yo, This is Apathy of the Demigodz
Comin for all you punk motherfuckers...
It Ain't Nuthin Nice... Celph Titled

I'm Undefeatable, Biggie would even say I'm unbelievable
Plus quick to flip like Sport Utility Vehicles
I crush years, so don't ever come near
Cause it was done from the beginning like Father MC's career
A new title holder is here this year
Ap's raps got more pussies open than pap smears
The nicest emcee, you'll never dispute
Cause I've been rappin since the tree on your Timb boots was roots
I knock more boots than 40 deuce prostitutes
But not for loot, only if she's hot and cute
Try and cock block my game it's complete violation
Cause Apathy's got more hoes/hose than fire stations
I face off with imitators and take off
Bring more flavor to the beef than steak sauce
You think your phatter than Apathy, but you way off
You're soft, and you've done more weight loss than Kate Moss

Chorus: repeat 4X

Let me tell you about my only vice
It has to do with rockin mics and it ain't nuthin nice

[Apathy]
Your shit's finito, I wrap up beef like a burrito
Underground flow, down low, incognito
The torpedo, that tore flows, that tore shows
Through tore clothes, before blows, through torsos
It's Apathy, so large my physical mass occupies
Multiple galaxies like god off calories
I cock back, rock raps for dickriders
My mic is something you should never pick up like hitchhikers
Above average, y'all better practice
Even weak emcee's consider you the wackest
I heard your debut joint, your song ain't hot
Its something that a crackhead would pawn for rock
I got bombs, with Glocks on lock to blow spots
My flow clocks the speed of mach and won't stop
You got a lot of hype, but I know you're a flop
Nothin's really gonna happen, like when the ball drops
You all stop, you all pussy clot
Mushy as when a cookie drops in milk
I pop like when rookie cops with Glocks and felt nervous at first
But the verses reverses, the guilt from the suckers I killed
I cop green, last and burn like hot steam
Spit one rhyme and destroy the pop scene
You cum too quick like a teen with hot dreams
You wack, while I crack more heads than rock fiends

Chorus [4x]

[Apathy]
I hold power like Imhotep controls magic
Spin old jazz wax, and spit over static
I want hip hop to come back and make classics
Nas should spit it like he did for Illmatic
My raps add up, like numbers in mathmatics
I got more tracks than arms of crack addicts
My wax acts like an axe hackin up faggots
Im fly, like the adult stage of maggots
Apathy is the illest on mics its like a habit
Even ask Ed O.G. "I Got to Have It"
Planes tailspin to the ground when Ap jacks it
I bubble your mouth full, like South Pole jackets
It's tragic, why you even mess with this rap shit
Nobody wants to fuck with you like busted fat chicks
Ya clips ain't full, when you pull your gat clips
Now how you gonna battle this, spittin that wack shit

Chorus [8x]

Demigodz, Apathy, we on the cut, you know the deal
My man Unknown on the ones and twos
Yall suckas can lose
There is no competition, y'all know how we do
It ain't nuthin nice[Scratch Hook]
"One gun, two gun, three gun, four
Your mind is all about crime"
"One gun, two gun, three gun, four"
"Clips are inserted into my gun"
"One gun, two gun, three gun, four
Your mind is all about crime"
"One gun, two gun, three gun, four"
"So I can take the money, never have to run"

[Verse One]
It's been all about (CRIME!)
Pretty much since the beginning of time
Early men killed each other for objects that shine
Now business men do it with progress in mind
It ain't all about sweeps, projects and nines
This is (CRIME!), a very complex design
As long as motherfuckers got checks to sign
As long as they connects got a Lex to shine
Find the money or these cats got tecs in mind
This is (CRIME!)
Ain't nobody new to it
Everybody been through it
Shit, even Martha Stewart do it
White collar, not a lot of time
Tell 'em what you got in mind, stock times to Glock clips
There's a whole lot of crime

[Scratch Hook]

[Verse 2: Apathy]
And now they configure their secrecy in dollar signs
All the time trying to increase they bottom line
By any means, any schemes, any product lies
Buying bullets and then go bowling for Columbine (CRIME!)
Con men, congressmen with they concubines
Condoleezza Rice types confound in the conscious mind (CRIME!)
They fronting with they witty facade
But more kids got guns than The City Of God
When Cube copped heat from Sweets with little cash supply
"Damn baby, tell your mother Jackie said 'Hi'."
They're easy to cop
Hard to stop
Even rappers are turning gangsta shit to pop

[Scratch Hook]

[Verse 3: Apathy]
There's even thugs running things in the slums of London, England
Drug rings, king pins, stay smuggling things in
Invest in a vest, chest protected with metal
A way of life from broken down to the molecular level
It's like one block, two blocks, three pounds of product
Four story building where that work gets knocked up
Powder got more power when cooked with flower
So these motherfuckers hustling till the 25th Hour
From the east to the west to the place you least expect
From the gangsters we respect to the snakes police protect
From the Criminal Minded like KRS-One
To the criminal minded like gangsters with guns

[Scratch Hook]

[Scratching]
"Yours, mine"
"It's all about crime"[Apathy]
I'll break ya brain cells off at the stem your status is stupider
Ap' is a nuclear blast, heart blacker than Lucifer
I could sit and write a list of all the shit I would do to ya
Head so big, I rest my fitted cap on Jupiter
You ain't built like this, you a soft carbon copy
A care bear compared to a auto-box rotty
For raps like crack I supply to the blacks
Drop pipes, cop mics, say good-bye to your rocks
I'm a motherfuckin star, the status of John Lennon
Y'all are ordinary people, singin' to John Legend
Write a track dissin' Ap'? Better X that out
I don't play that, like rap in a redneck's house
I could have ya brain cells spinnin quicker than Sprewell's
Ya female e-mailing me all ya details
I don't dig up dirt, I shake the Earth
And I never say names, I wouldn't waste a verse
Off of the top I'm hot, and when they dare me to write
Prepare to carry a mic to a burial site
I'm a pioneer fuckin' up stereotypes
I snatch chains as a kid, made you carry ya bikes
I got an addiction to spitting shit is heroin-like
Story teller speak of hell and the American plight
Money blower, funny though it seems embarrassin' right?
Rock shows, blow the do' on a pair of Air Nike's
All Night!

[Tak]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Yo
You know the rules, I cruise with a tough band
You in the fuckin closet with brooms and a dustpan
I clean sweep ya fleet, body softer than gelatin
Now you on the mic, yeah right my life in ya skeleton dummy
I'm in the place, you can tell when it's bloody
I freakin', pay for ya face grade and mail you the money
I'm ready I'm willin' to watch, spy on seven that flinch
Let's see if I don't kill 'em in five seconds or less
I keep comin' back like rashes on an infant
You don't wanna chance to clash with the magnificent
Seven of us, it's heaven but never enough
So I tighten the vice grip, so his head'll get crushed
Look, I'm out of sight now, deep in this music
Leavin' 'em upside-down, fiendin for new shit
Ribkat it's the roll power creep in the booth quick
Blow a hole in ya back, just to eat off a soup dish
You bitch

[Celph Titled]
Yo!
The Demigod stands for killa's
More specifically we Deadly Entertainers Maniac Ignorant GODzilla's
And we, never took the route them other crooks took
Cuz we kept recipes for human flesh in my mother's cookbook
Get souffled in more ways then ten
Celph Titled flow is chokin' the wind, my favorite pastime's soakin' in sin
The most accurate sharpshooter with no scope
Shoot with my left and watch you all die from secondhand smoke
I'm reppin' my fam SO, You better act cool
My soul will make a Ouija Board jump up and slap you dummy
You not thinkin' smart
I bust so many blamma's and blicka's that I should start a rock band called
"Blink & Spark"
Sinkin' sharks with no harpoons, my arsenal
Is sawblade carbon tools slidin' ya coffin through
Apathy's insane and I'm the same as my brother
I'm like a circus show sniper, I aim for the juggler
Catch a case and before the judge can slam down the gavel
The whole room duck and hide from grenade shrapnel
These rap verses I be breezin' through
Cuz I'm like a celebate, under oath, Un-Fuckin-Believable

(behind turntable scratchin) x2
Demigods, Fort Minor
"Ya Ya heard of us"
Styles of Beyond
"Ya Ya heard of us, the murderous"[Scratch Hook] {x2}
"Lyrical Commission"
"Turntable and I, tear shit up"
"Celph Titled"
"Settle the score"
"All out war"

(Verse 1: Trem)

This is all out war with a fallout sure to cause a backlash
I’ll bash in your fucking face, I don’t stab backs
Trends attacking rappers with a thirst for blood
Submerge your body in a river shoved in a Persian rug
Eternal come for curtains, that’s a certainty
Leaving third degree burns from these first degree murder sprees
Earning me and my verse and these words global praise
I throw grenades when I flow and set the show ablaze
A fire bug for hire shrugging a cop off
Plug in the micro bomb, soft cunts to compost
We from a long lost planet where rap is real
Still intact and untapped by the mass appeal
Market, LC spark and blast targets
Master the craft and kick it raw like a carcass
Lyrical Commission's carving a path with rotor blades
We roll deeper in the streets than a motorcade

(Verse 2: brad strut)

I’m barely breathing, bleeding, heart rate increasing
It’s fire stakes, I can’t take fakes and thieves
And past mistakes seep in through the gaps of my armour
Ain't nothing what it seems as I battle with snake charmers
Paint you a portrait, I got a sword, just not cautious, do what I want
My squads forces hard to handle like a grenade on detonation
Rock the candles, a parade of devastation
Defend the nation while I step inside your earlobes
And carve you split of slick spits and I don’t fear no man
You need heroes, all I want is beer, blow some weed and type speech
Some beats and reap zero, disrespect, I hinder reps with heavy burden
Get in your head, and leave you left for dead, they’re calling curtains
This shit’s superb in your Car or Walkman, go stalking an important
Public figure’s son is a slick assassinator, four fours caught in an elixir
Sworn to fascinate you with scorn joining the mix, it’s life and death
In this business, it’s kind of sad, but I define my track with death scriptures

(Verse 3: Celph Titled)

There ain't a motherfucker been in more fights than me
O.G.'s in my hood ain't got more stripes than me
Celph Titled is known to tote but when I ain't packing
I keep a buck 150 nigga, we can get it cracking
And if I throw slugs you better pray they graze your chin
You said you had an infrared but that was just a laser pen
Just the sight of me will make you strain to breathe
I shoot till I'm satisfied, I aim to please
And you ain't got more ammo than me
With clips there's no contender
In my house we keep gun oil in a liquid soap dispensers
You shouldn't let your mouth flap
Cause I'mma put you down under and I ain't talking 'bout The Outback
In New York I'm grungy
In Australia I'm Dundee
Cooking barbecue with just the smoke from my gun heat
Niggas get comfy with a pillow in they face
The Demigodz and Commission filling body bags by the case

(Verse 4: Bob Balans)

The world leaves the forgotten to lurk in the waste
That’s why I don’t trust, I hurdle through space
With a thrust and peril is safe from the payback
Cause where I stay you fight for a placemat
And I don’t say cat, cause where I grew up that meant faggot
But I do leaves tracks po’wed and flattered
Staked in habit, daggered, when I unsheathe the mic from the scabbard
And uphold the standard cause your fates borrowed
So check the horrid scars on your face and forehead
In hostile territory like foreign embassy
LC start a war, now we’re the common enemy
Execute you to a tight schedule
Get the general, the rest are expendable
Melt ya, every decibel held ya in a molten tank
Until it’s over your scalp and there’s nothing left for burial
Your aluminum in the smolder stay crushed, the heavy fuel
Expels the metal shells in your shoulder
Arial assault leave you pumped like a propeller[Verse 1: Apathy]
Yo I’m a bastard, the after-effect of passionate sex
I came out the bassinette blasting a TEC
Look out your window, see Ap passing your jet
With Superman in a headlock and a gat to his neck
Fuck kryptonite, picture bloods and crips on Krypton
Superhuman powers, a cape with house slippers on
I kept it real, money’s never my Achilles heel
I’m like Cliff Lee going for the Phillies deal

[Verse 2: Esoteric]
I’m a rebel with mics, I’m Daredevil with sight
I can be the peacemaker, I can set off the fight
Don’t provoke us, fuck around and get your death notice
I’m just trying to raise awareness, I ain’t talking about Chef’s focus
I’m like a combination of George and Frank Lucas
You you’re LUCAS, you catch locusts, eat mucus
So don’t you ever step, never rep, you will never get better
So get clever and drop the motherfucking mic forever

[Verse 3: Blacastan]
Step inna di dance, wit’ a splif of sensi
Running with them boys called DGZ
AOTP performing and they ain’t no joke
Fuck around and get your scrawny pencil neck broke
I’m a criminal, rain dance on you like a Seminole
Shitstorm your label flipping over tables
Professor X out of the chair, fully able
Wolverine up in the booth slicing your cables

[Verse 4: Reef the Lost Cauze]
This my kind of beat, the body will feel it, the mind is weak
So I slam bodies like Iron Sheik
This is hustle music nigga, we grind and eat
Fuck a hater, feel this razor that’s inside my sneaks
My brother Ap blap blap this is Honkey talk
The flow is tighter than how a fucking honkey walk
This junkyard calls, call a Coroner
Undertake you, break you, the ultimate warrior

[Verse 5: Planetary]
Yeah million dollar man, Ted DiBiase shit
Ralph Macchio flow winning like Karate Kid
Miyagi when I politic, Obama with the Poligrip
Mad at the world, every verse I gotta body shit
Ric Flair silver-haired nigga getting old yo
Army of the Pharaoh clique, the rest of y’all are so-so
Me and Crypt are like the legion of doom
You can’t defeat us and we putting non believers in tombs

[Verse 6: Crypt the Warchild]
Murderous arrangement using words to just play with
Guilty by association at my arraignment
Nightcrawler, knife brawler, fight harder
Pipe drawl if I’m dead I’m a mic martyr
Puerto rock, know how to spit, that’s undisputed
AOTP, we dirty, we ghetto, we zooted
We get gully, grime pays and y’all peddle y’all music
You got a new album, nobody listening to it

[Verse 7: Motive]
My appetite is Galactus like, eating satellites
A iceberg Cyclops will freeze the blast of light
When this bastard writes it mics the afterlife
F with us, I check niggas like the answers right
I ain’t the type to walk around with my pants all tight
I love white women but live a Black Panther’s life
This Demigod get the job done effortless
Got 'em waiting on the kid to drop like a pregnant bitch

[Verse 8: Celph Titled]
I ain’t from this planet, your human rap skills are just lukewarm
I got alien intestines like the ones that kept Luke warm
Angering actors, action-packed factoring
Factions in Anchorage, Alaska waving an axe at you
(Who want it?)
My unfortunate Orthodontist astonished
That I had Cobra’s teeth, I bit him in his shoulder meat
All’s fair, I floss yeah the Boss here
Won’t keep you in my prayers but I’ll keep you in my crosshairs

[Verse 9: Vinnie Paz]
Vinnie van-hammer, Paz hit you with the blam blammer
Get my money on the street like a panhandler
American me motherfucking Santana
Rock more polo shit than a Cam stanza
Y’all are Kanye, sweeter than a canned Fanta
Allahu Akbar Lord I’m Iran’s chancellor
There’s blood dripping from my mouth like a tanned panther
I’m the motherfucking boss like the man Danza[Intro] [Blacastan talking]:
The first few bars is fucked up

[Scratches]:
"I was Audi 5000" - Ice Cube 'Alive On Arrival'

[Verse One] [Apathy]:
Earth rumbling
Deity humbling
U.F.O.'s are hovering, times are so troubling
Doctors started hustling, blood starts puddling
I'm shuttering, discovering, they just started shuttling
Humans to the surface of Mars
Cops searchin' our cars to confiscate notebooks, verses and bars
Aquaman lungs live in worlds like Atlantis
Cause we destroyed the whole planet with ecological damage
Helicopters patrol, doctors chop up our souls
When we go off the Zoloft we outta control
Now we paranoid animals, A Planet Of Apes
With nowhere to escape unless we launch into space
So I gathered all my old school Clue mixtapes
And started diggin' in the crates before we disintegrate
Demigodz, fuck bitches, get money, not much else
I'm Audi 5000 'fore I pass it to Celph

"I was Audi 5000"

[Verse Two] [Celph Titled]:
They said it was a murder attempt
Cause when I punched him in the skull it left a permanent dent
Baritone voice with some nice patterns
Fuck a polar bears toe nail, I'm colder than Antarctic ice caverns
Mice and rabbits, they all looked at as snake food
But I'm hungry for bitches marinatin' in my bake roast
Stomp through like I had earthquake shoes
Showed you how to commit murder over break loops and let AK's shoot
My flow can move mountains
Bank account's a loot fountain
Yeah I need two accountants, really who's countin'? (I don't know)
My water pistol shoots a potent starch
That'll have you lookin' like the dude who stood in front of the open Arc
Intelligent war sword wielder
Reroute the ignition to your gas tank
Charles Dutton four wheeler
Demigodzilla
You should already know, I'm Audi 5000 so I'll pass it to Mo'

"I was Audi 5000"

[Verse Three] [Motive]:
The most ignorant
Every verse ridiculous
Satan sadistic
Caught in church gettin' his dick licked
Hallelujah, all praise to the Godz
The dopest nigga alive is now arrived
Fuck for the love, I'm tryin' to cash in for a mil' or two
And show you monkey ass niggas how gorillas do
Bring on the bestest, claim he's spittin' that ether boy
Bet when we meet he greet me like Tim Tebow scored
It's hoodie, two shoes, mad rude, no home trainin'
Send your bitch back, ass hurt and throat achin'
I'm Doe Rakeing, sippin' Henny at probation
A lot of dollars made off of that powder that's Caucasian
And any beef shit, no secret how I do
Battle kiss your forehead like your mama duke
The new Big Daddy Kane, Ain't No Half Steppin'
I'm Audi five G till the rat ranch dressing

"I was Audi 5000"

[Verse Four] [Ryu]:
I'm Audi 5000 G
Oh yeah, I'm outty, like a Saudi I got mouths to feed
The revolution will not be televised
What you mean?
I just spent ten grand fillin' my house with flat screens
Some gasoline and empty bottles of bourbon
The kind of cocktail party you leave first degree burns with
I'm filthy, the dirty version, no detergent
If rap was Iraq, I'd be a fuckin' insurgent
I blow the spot up, give me my 30 virgins
A place in paradise, to me it's kinda worth it, right?
Fuckin' A it is, pop the stainless
Hit him till his chest make a noise like Jadakiss
The world famous, Demigod gangstas
We the same as other rappers, except nobody hates us
I ain't even gotta say shit
What could I say?
Besides I'm Audi 5 K before I pass to Seamus

"I was Audi 5000"

[Verse Five] [Esoteric]:
We the O.G. trilogy you couldn't equal the sequel
Defeatin' Esoteric? That'll take a legend like Repo
Listen, do a, CD together
You and me? Never
I'd rather listen to Nickelback on repeat forever
Lousy mix, [?] of a southie flick, bitches with the pouty lips
Lets be Audi 5 in my Audi 6
Forgot the A
They don't ever walk away
"Let Me Ride like Dr. Dre" is all these women say
Now check it
One thing about me, I'm too wordy
Put so much shit in a song you'd think the clean version's dirty
So step up
You can try to bring about my death soldier
Curses
Foiled again like last nights left overs
Oh Jesus, fall guy like Colt Seavers, I flow with no breathers
That's a Memphis Monroe beavers
Ryu, Celph, Ap, Motive got my back
I'm Audi 5000 so I'll pass it to Black

"I was Audi 5000"

[Verse Six] [Blacastan]:
There's only 60 minutes in an hour so give me 24 of those to live
I'll load the cig and find the kid who killed B.I.G
Run him down and put 16 in his wig
Make him wanna take back the foul shit that he did
That's word to my unborn kid who ain't a fetus
Sixth man off the bench, Demigodz undefeated
Many crews fell off and their legacy's depleted
But we here for the gusto, keepin' it raw
And it's a must that we crush doe, live on tour
Crowds roar, demandin' encores and more
Shut your mall down, buyin' all the Nikes out stores
Bare footed in the villa with the heated marble floors
Wars get waged on every notebook page
Act your age, Celph Titled prolly packin' a gauge
There's no need for the antics, wildin' on drugs
Man I'm Audi 5000, I'm pullin' the plug

"I was Audi 5000"[Intro: Celph Titled/Majik Most]
MM: What for real? His skull? It just washed up on Clearwater Beach?
CT: No doubt
MM: Well, that's what he gets
CT: Word up
MM: That's what you get...
CT: I tried to tell him, fucking around with Tampa nigga shit is no joke
That's where the fuck I'm from man
MM: It ain't no joke check it out. I'm Majik Most, and this is my motherfucking man Celph Titled
We gon' run this Tampa hip hop shit like this
CT: What you know about that?
MM: Leave you with a little deformed skull. A human petting zoo. Fucking check it out
CT: Fuck that
MM: Ay yo, tell em what your name is

[Verse 1: Celph Titled]
Celph Titled, the motherfucking OG killer
Nobody can hold heat iller with this magnifique milla
Meter, we on the creep to meet ya better hope
That we won't put the metal to your chest like a stethoscope
And Majik Most came through with rocket launchers
Crazy shit, dump your baby's crib on [?] kid
In 5 o'clock traffic live on TV, you gon see me with Bob Hype gripping my Glock tight

[Verse 2: Majik Most]
Deep from the depths of Tampa, Majik appears
Everybody love me, fucking man of the year
Motherfuckers don't fear, my man Celph's here
That's why you got a bazooka pointed at your ear
Bombard your brain
Like seeing a bondage flick with your mom in the chains
I'll put you in some flames
Yeah motherfucker that's more than a threat
Ah too late, now you're a charcoal briquette

[Hook: Celph/Majik]
CT: If you watch how I move you're damn right I'm a player and pimp
Just came back from Hell, but I don't walk with a limp
In the hood in Tampa Bay they saying "Celph, you hot,"
They like me they should love me more than they love 'Pac
MM: If you watch how I move you're damn right I'm a player and pimp
I just fucked your girl, now she walk with a limp
In the hood in Tampa Bay they saying "Majik, you hot,"
They like me, they should love me more than they love 'Pac

[Verse 3: Majik Most]
Ayo, catch me frequently freaking 3 chicks
With me and Ronald Isley on "The Magic Scene (Remix)"
Check the prefix, come on 813
Result in drastic measures, fucking with Dick Fleger
Off the radar, channel 8 cover up
Shit got fucked up when his body bubbled up
His corpse was found chain tied to an oil tanker
Now I guess you can say he's a real news anchor

[Verse 4: Celph Titled]
Yo, fuck 8 on your side, I got a 9 on my side
That's putting 16 slugs in your spine
Act like a thug around me, you must be out of your mind
I'm straight from Hillsboro you must be outside the county line
This is Tampa nigga motherfuck wherever you're from
We so crazy, doing drive-by stabbings with no guns
End up at Bayfront with treatment for 8 lumps
You rep New York down here go back where you came from

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Celph Titled/Majik Most]
CT: You faggot protestors better duck when we deploy shots
You had a young man in your bed and called it a boycott
MM: Yo, to find an MC that can spray in these ways
Is like finding Kirk Cameron on camera these days
CT: And when the heat blaze like fast food we do it your way
Serve you with two big macs watch your chest get filleted
MM: And I'll smack your head back, you'll be wearing Sway's hat
With MTV News zooming in on that bruise
CT: Whose crew got more pimps?
We putting C4 in seafood serving y'all some real popcorn shrimp
MM: Bitch you wanna battle? Come on, you're from where?
You'll play like Rick Moranis and shrink your whole career
CT: It's like you near a swimming pool cuz you gon get wet
And I'm the type to do a cannon ball right on your kid's head
MM: I put your girl in a leather mask with the zipper mouth
In the sun your grandma turned to leather when you left her out

[Outro: Celph Titled/Majik Most]
MM: I told you man, look at you! You're sad
CT: Sad as hell
MM: Your face melted off, where's your face, man?
CT: Look at that shit
MM: Yo, fucking with Tampa that's what happens
CT: You fucked up
MM: That's what you get!
CT: You're goddamn right
MM: And you got it!
CT: Word up, we turn beef to mince meat out these motherfuckers
MM: Yo, what is that, his vertebrae?
CT: Yeah, I see the collarbone
MM: Nah nah, yo, that's a leg
CT: Nah that's a motherfucking fibula
MM: Yo, I think I see the skull
CT: Yeah yeah it's still got some hair on it
MM: Yo, what is that, a wing?
CT: Yeaaah
MM: Ha ha...[Verse 1:Doap Nixon]

Left check, right check, brass knuckles, knife check
Nine double-m, black talons that ? check
Sour diesel, purple haze ? cloned
Two albums, both classics, my fans is grown
City life ain’t nothing like the south dude
How this nigga run his mouth with a missing tooth?
Three masters, we all got padawans
Dudes trying to bust heat, we got bag of bombs
You got word that Celph got the south hitting
Ap’s up top, me I’m right in the middle
And I got these rappers trying to bite my flow
Lying to their fans like they’re really getting dough
I’m Richard Pryor in his first movie
I’m a vet, salute me, rap raw like sushi
We the three hottest niggas in the game now
Cock it back bang let it bang now

[Verse 2:Apathy]

Bionic demonic evolution pollution of the soul gold-plated
Nickel-plated pistol that’s located
Sedated, straitjacket, I traffic narcotics
I’m cosmic, cookie-cutter pussy up or cut her I’m robotic
Magical when I’m pouring all these potions in the pot
Fucked up from all those years pops smoked pot, coke, and microdots
My sniper on the roof don’t blink from rifle shots
Ninja Gaiden moves when I scale up walls
Throw Chinese stars when I rhyme these bars
Spit-shine these scars, AP stand large
Leave your head covered red like Van Halen guitars
I’m 80’s, kinda like Charles In Charge
New Edition and DeBarge and DeLorean cars
We harvest human bodies like alien farms
I’ll leave cuts on guts but not caesarian scars

[Verse 3:Celph Titled]

I stay cap-peeling 'em, rap villain with a cape and cane
Passenger 57 bringing snakes on a plane
Sit you in the motherfucking exit row seat, blow the door off
Watch you soar, off the Testarossa speed
The metronome to my beat’s erratic like jungle music
I put a hole in your dome, don’t need a gun to do it
Yeah I’m fucking stupid
The Army of the Gods is certified, I cosign everyone I’m in a group with
I get it popping in here, yes Redenbacher is here
Robocop, Clarence Boddicker’s here
Seems like everybody’s scared whenever flying iron disperse
Pints will squirt, now your polo rugby is a Hawaiian shirt
And I insert sharp knives to your chestplate
You will shit without Kaopectate
We don’t spectate opening acts cause they probably suck
We slice through your crew, show you how to make a posse cut[Intro: Vinnie Paz]
Hahahaha…
Yeah, muthafuckas! We’re back!
Pharaoh clique, muthafucka! Yeah!
Des Devious! (King Syze!)
Apathy! Celph Titled! (Kamachi!)
Vinnie P.! Outerspace!
7L, ES!

[Apathy]
I put you up on the IV, not the Roman Numeral 4
But the IV that leads to the funeral floor
Wax gets melted; breaks bones, fractures pelvis
Speeds through space and cracks glass Astronaut helmets
Face it, motherfucker I can pay to get rid of you
I've got more heads in the hood than Pagan rituals
A new tyrannical force for you to fear
Known to kill and keep human ears as souvenirs
A shape shifter face slitter, paper getter
Tape your sister, rape your sister
Make your sister take it in the face
And if you're facing us, block off a 30 block radius
I throw more blows than boxing Dr. Octavius

[King Syze]
Ever since we made some noise I learned people love a winner
We the quality of deep dish rims, y'all the hub spinners
Tough sinners, break bread with Jesus at dinner
Protected by a heavenly force, fuck a minister
Niggas know better, no one's letter is better than mine
Everytime I rhyme, it's metal; the terror level is high
Plus I testify, it's best you die
Then find the truth deep down in a mountain of lies
Downsize, I'm ousting you guys deep in the dirt
Clocking in and out of rap, have y'all fiending for work
When I breed it, yo it's treason what the semen is worth
Non-believing, make me steaming, make you meeting the earth

[Crypt the Warchild]
Ayo it's my world and I won't stop
And if you stand in my way you bound to get popped
In the land where you lay, invade from straight shots
I demand that you pay and stray from straight blocks
I'm the man that you pray, don't spray the flames hot
I could tan in the blaze for days and stain cops
I astound and amaze, y'all praise the same god
I'm a pound out your brain and scrape the graveyard
Have you shout out in pain, y'all say y'all bravehearts
I'm a box up your frame and play the same card
And I'm out for fame, spacebars and quasars
Pharoahs locked the game, no shame, we hate y'all

[Vinnie Paz]
Yeah! Raw muthafuckin rap! Hardcore shit! Ninety four shit
Shoot the fuckin place up, yeah!

[Des Devious]
AOTP blast through your army fatigues
Damage your team, competition done it with ease
Gun in my sleeve cause now a days homicide is my steez
Collecting my cream, I'm living your dream and peeping your scheme
Put you on lean from right hooks, pausing your jux
You fake crooks need to hit them books
Learn the rules of the game
Two to your brain, three to your frame, incredible pain
You getting drenched in that November rain
We the opposite of that whack shit
Trash man of clap rapping, you die, trash it
Five six professional assassins
Rocking these mics and repping my fam' with passion
Remember its Q-Dement', you bastards

[Esoteric]
Tell your man and your parents
We be demandin' ten grand an appearance
At a minimum my venom damage your lyrics
We be like Manny Ramirez, comes out in fall
With the radical, magical, and emphatical
I'mma battle till I shatter your clavicle
Call me admiral, raising the temp of the room
I'm the emperor, remember I never surrender, I dismember platoons
Your petty men are bufoons
We send 'em to their doom the second my venom enters their wounds
I mentally bloom, exhume tombs with dope lyrics
2Pac's alive and well, Big L 'The Devil's Son' rise from hell with those lyrics
Live in regret, AOTP these shook rappers hit the deck

[Chief Kamachi]
Courtesy of the streets, make it a microphone Middle East
My specialty, only rhymer enveloping my lyric sheets
Knock turbans off of sheiks
Use a pipe bomb
Downtown Israeli boutiques full of dead tourists
With they dreams no longer in arms' reach
That's what I call 'dealing with calm speech'
When I alarm your peeps
Inscribed in a peasant's palm is a blessed psalm
If you draw and your weapons wrong, there ain't no stepping on
My forty-five is my weapon
My culture's a holster with seven inch slugs is kept in
Squarely I step in, tilting my clips and blue Stetson
God is my essence, and you could check these rhymes for reference
Adept to any preference, pussy

[Vinnie Paz]
Yeah baby, kings of the motherfuckin' underground
Y'all motherfuckers don't want it with us. This that raw shit, throwback shit

[Celph Titled]
I make Evil Knievel music
I come through stunting
Every verse is the same, just flipped a little something-something
Baby I'm crazy, a crazy baby, a sick infant
Born with an intent to spit slick sentences with sick penmanship
Shoot at your Chicago fitted and knock your socks off
Aimed at your door but hit your head, shot your locks off
I heard you was afraid to say my name on your record
Cause you's afraid I'd put your motherfucking frame on a stretcher
I can't change laws sons, that's a government issue
But I'll break laws with a gun, that's a government issue
It's the Army, we got power in numbers
And that's nines, forty-fives, three-five-sevens, and M500s

[Planetary]
Some people say I'm superior when I shit it
Vivid visionary spit, vocabulary ridiculous
I am a tyrant, I'm Violent by Design
I silence the scientific with every line of the rhyme
Mozart of street rap, breaking the barriers
Space harrier filled with forties and pit terriers
Ready to mangle, anybody crossing the line
I saw the sign and ran with the army, lost in time
Ready for war but won't rock no dick trees
I rock mic's, you think it's a hundred and sixty degrees
Who stomp crews, batter and bruise cliques
Kill bitches and stab you tricks with loose lips

[Vinnie Paz]
I'm slightly disturbed, Pazienza is nice with the words
That's the reason that I'm fly like the life of a bird
I don't care if you're dead, let god have ya
Cause I'mma stay rugged and raw like Marv Hagler
That's something you don't know about me small rapper
Nice with the left, nice with the right, the jaw tapper
Allah backer, murder every track that I'm on
You just spit a fucking verse whack then you're gone
Fuck fame, I study the fame closely
They build you up, then you get rocked like Shane Mosley
It's pain homie, and your blood on my pen
It's Army of the Pharoahs and we're flooded with gems[Verse 1: Apathy]
I travel underground like the Goonies with a bag full of uzis
Emerging in a corner store where Arabs sell loosies
My banger's on the waist, I never wave it around
But I always chamber a round when there's strangers around
Set my phaser to kill, my force field is on max
Never relax, study the facts and stockpile gats
Cause the sky's about to bleed blood out from the clouds
This gas mask's in my backpack when walking through crowds
The post-apocalyptic, optic fitted with bionic circuitry
Surgically planted perfectly, no way to word it verbally
But extrasensory perception got me detecting
Any cop or detective, intercept them, and stop 'em with weapons

[Verse 2: King Syze]
King Syze, Vinnie Paz, we like Animal Hawk
Grammatical master for art, Heavy Metal we smashing your thoughts
We upper level, you rappers are technicians
Undergraduates I gotta doctorate when it comes to ripping
Scientific, I was spawned from a different species
And if you beat me, you gon’ fight me every time you see me
It’s never over, fuck Syze it's King Cobra
I’m brushing off my shoulders, spittin lethal plus we taking over
I’m getting older so I live by the new slogan
That Philly shit the barrel smoke will leave your head open
IIt’s open season on any rapper who want to beef with
The Army of the Pharaohs, yeah man we’ll bring the seasoning

[Verse 3: Crypt the Warchild]
Don't hit me with the drama, don't approach me 'bout no B.I
Cause I'm a Pharaoh king, and y'all ain't worthy of a reply
Bodies I've caught decomposing on the seaside
Catch me river dancing through the bloody waters, knee-high
Mind state is cutthroat, can't walk around deprived
My team shut it down, any access will be denied
Crown royal status Puerto-Ricans, that's how we ride
Nocturnal souls mesmerized by the streetlights
One shot at glory, game will never give you three tries
For the haters I've murked, they would love to see me die
Acid tripping vision, everything look hi-defy
Drugs, money, liquor, only things that get me by

[Verse 4: Jus Allah]
I got a lot of hate, I got to learn to love, stop the date
But some days I would rather murder than populate
Either way, I gotta open up the cosmic gates
Who knows what the future holds, gotta watch and wait
I can't function clear, keep a ton of guns and beer
I never sweat it, I get arrested like once a year
My gun big as two guns, you should cover your ears
Believe half of what you see and nothing you hear
Nobody listens, I got a lot of ground to cover
Bullets go in one ear and out the other
Tucked the weapon in, kick his face
In the blood pool like give him a taste of his own medicine

[Verse 5: Esoteric]
Impeach the president, I’m pulling out my ray-gun
Chuck D’s greatest line and y'all ain’t even thank him
Y'all ain’t on my radar, horrible like Hagar
Mos Eisleys flow, beats banging on the space bar
Haters get mad, start banging on the spacebar
Flip over the desk, ought to take it up with HR
Your bitch give Bad Brains, like she work for H.R
I be where the rays are, you wonder where the weights are
I’m a cannibal, you cats wonder where the plates are
I know that I’m immortal why you wonder where the gates are
I Cold Crush your Brother like Grandmaster Caz
Paz work with the .45 like Lakim Shabazz

[Verse 6: Blacastan]
I’m from the East Coast nigga, but I’m still loc'ed out
I grew up inside the crack-house, my moms was smoked out
You know the kid with the bummy kicks, holes in his jeans
Same shirt, chilling on some bummy shit
Yeah, that was me though, attracted to the metal like Magneto
Sneakers started talking like ay bandito
Got my own never borrowed or begged for shit
Now it's on cause I'm rolling with the Pharaohs legit
Tired of rappers always rhyming that bullshit
Catch at you at your CD signing, with a full clip
Now, how you feel about the Pharaohs and the Demigodz?
That’s what I thought nigga, because we large and in charge

[Verse 7: Celph Titled]
Keep shooters on stash, move and they blast
Refugees that came on an inner tube with a gat
Rubix Cuban code name, but you will respect the handle
Spend checks on Windex so I shine the chrome enamel
I throw hands with the devil so ain't much to fear after
Bitches cry over me, I'm a top tier rapper
American Idol with a wet wipe for you Desperate Housewives
Firecracker go off from my brick, the whole house white
And I will outright say that you soft
I write your favorite writer that you base your style off of
I'll let the Tec blast in ya, if the check cash finish
Shells give you a turtle-face, make ya back splinter

[Verse 8: Planetary]
With the semi-automatic, sipping henny in the attic
Spitting heavy with the god of the Serengeti blasted
Fasted, ‘till I downloaded the attachment
The hunger came back, and I’m eating like a savage
Walking through the labyrinth, imagining it’s Nazareth
Throwing more stones at the throne, lone catalyst
Puff puff pass it, that ain't ever been me
Only had the urge to annihilate the emcee
Used to ride the ten-speed, and copped the top ten sneaks
Never thought I’d be in Budapest counting ten Gs
But it all makes sense to me
Pharaoh clique sick man we thick more than ten feet

[Verse 9: Vinnie Paz]
If I ain’t heard of y'all rappers then you gotta be soft
That’s the reason why I talk about the bodies I caught
Bodies in north, New Haven down to New York
If it’s a fight they put in front of me, it’s gotta be fought
They got me in court for carrying the burner on the waist
My lawyer is an animal, he murdering the case
Boombox hardbody murdering the tape
I'll take your fucking heart like a burglar on a date
I’m magic with the four-fifth, perfect with the eight
I lavish with the lyricals, superlatives is great
Mash a motherfucker out, tourniquet his face
Jheri-head rappers ain’t assertive as the great, yeah[Verse 1: Apathy]
I'm at the opera sitting up in the balcony
Gun aimed at the valkeyrie
Backstage I dabble in black magic & alchemy
Briefcase of cash, passports with a fake name
Traveling through Russia with bombs on a freight train
Turn popes to cokeheads cause they broke bread with goat heads
Paranoid skitzophrenics with no meds
Weaving through the Vatican traffic on a moped
Carrying machine guns, cops scream code red
Command center computers scramble to find intruders
Police scan the local rooftops for sharp shooters
I'm cold as Siberia, flow is so superior
The smell of cigars stain Mercedes interior
The black snow, black hole leader like Castro
I'm sitting in a cemetery poisoning black crows
The mass knows nothing of my fiendish plots
They try deciphering the rhymes that this genius drops
I concoct concoctions to make your heartbeat stop
We're locked in a Russian gulag sleeping on old cots
Guards moving like robots patroling the cellblocks
30 below zero, who the hell said Hell's hot?
I swore to my maker I'd never spit a wack flow
Or spend eternity in Hell shoveling black snow

[Hook: Ill Bill]
Watch out where them Snowgoons go
We make the sky bleed black snow
Not after your cash, we are after your soul
We make the sky bleed black snow

[Verse 2: Sicknature]
The Snowgoons are battering rams through your speaker
Hazardous craft that´ll freeze ya
Earthquaking bangers and them smackers that slap up the sleepers
Landscapes are collapsing when we shatter the sets
We are like the Four Horsemen breathing down the back of your neck
Curtains are met for competition with no further regrets
Have you floating the ocean face down with a bird on your head
I'm leaving rivals flabbergasted, minds can have you backless
That´s why I´ll design my raps to chop heads off like flying battle-axes
Green Mile on beat, killing it, you as relevant as garbage
Stomp through your empire like the elephants of Carthage
Colder than the poles when the notions are woven
Stay in control and always keep one eye open like Odin
When the market is too numb we march to the goon drum
'Till it´s a wrap, leaving you wrapped in a carpet of goosebumps
The storm comes, there´ll be no time for a last phone call
When the dark skies open to let the black snow fall

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Celph Titled]
I got a sinister plot to administer shots
Samurais that let hammers fly, ninjas with Glocks
Bust through brick walls, walk through glass
Terminator Titled, let 'em live, why would I do that?
Dumping everything I got at ya
Don't you think it's odd that I run this shit from Antarctica to Ottawa?
Stuff you in a garbage truck,cause you been trash
Wear your hat straight, but I'll put snaps where your brim at
Make you rock a special needs helmet cause you been wack
Uppercut punch, left you bent back
Halfway up your nose was the chin strap
The doctor handed me some notes and this graph
That said this boy need a skin graft
I don't talk to cops so save that report
My interrogation video's a Charlie Chaplin short
So when you hear the gat blow we comin' through the backdoor
I let the brrrat go repping for Black Snow

[Hook][Verse One: Fabolous]
You're lookin' at the rookie rapper
With a years biggest itcha rows
Yeah this nigga switch his flows
Yeah I dig and switch his hoes
Hear them niggas snitch to po's
Where a nigga pitch his blow
And how my hustle gross is near that nigga Richard Po's
I share my figures with the hoes
I'm where the digger stitch his clothes
It's ghetto F.A.B.O.L.O.U.S
I got street legend, fame
I'm the kid known to put the Colt to a bredren's frame
Like he's Edgerrin James
Y'all stash guns I carry 'em on my waist
Ya part time piece
Aquarium interface
The hood rat Hugh Heff, loungin' on ya in the Rolls
The project Playmates, around the corner centerfolds
I'm constant hated
Listen to the nonsense stated
But niggas can't shit on me like they constipated
I briefly conversated
These doors sittin' on ten times two
Mami what's so complicated?
Ya heard?

[Hook]
[Hot Karl]
Blao! Explosion, game on lock
Hotness, drop this, it's that sick hip hop
It's like blao!
[Fabolous]
I'm a coast to coast G, keep the toaster closely
So duck deez motherfucker
Blao!
[Redman]
Said it before, ready for war
With my sawed off shotgun, hand on the pump, pump
Blao!
[Celph Titled]
Slap my gat, I ain't hear to talk
You wanna make it gutter I can throw you off the sidewalk

[Verse Two: Hot Karl]
It's like Karl, Pac and Biggie is the greatest to rhyme
Problem is, this list only exists in my mind
So instead
I listen to your style and keep laughin'
You beatin' me rappin', that's like Jim Abbott clappin'
That'll never happen, I'm sicker of course
Then droppin' a dime
Like Shawn Kemp's child support
Look at all you kids, underground and straight shook
You ain't gettin' signed like nerdy kids yearbooks
I'm gettin' second looks but the industry is shitty
Cause I'd rather die than ever sound like Chingy
Right Thurr
Come on dawg
You ain't gettin' robbed
Cause it's uneven, like Dru Hill on a seesaw
Yo, you don't want any bad blood in-between us
Like we're standing right next to Magic Johnson's intravenous
[Celph Titled]
It's Hot Karl and Celph so if you wanted a hit
[Hot Karl]
You can peep the famous guys and fast forward our shit

[Hook]
[Hot Karl]
Blao! Explosion, game on lock
Hotness, drop this, it's that sick hip hop
It's like blao!
[Fabolous]
I'm a coast to coast G, keep the toaster closely
So duck deez motherfucker
Blao!
[Redman]
Said it before, ready for war
With my sawed off shotgun, hand on the pump, pump
Blao!
[Celph Titled]
Slam my gat, I ain't hear to talk
You wanna make it gutter I can throw you off the sidewalk

[Verse Three: Celph Titled]
They say cause I don't believe in Christ that I'm misled
Been shot at twice but never hit I just miss lead
Get it right, the name's Celph Titled
Straight out of motherfuckin' Tampa
Leavin' enough gun smoke to give you lung cancer
Plans for your album?
It's best if you lose those
Shoot up your M.P.C. and you gonna find a few loop holes
We sellin' bullet wounds, havin' a wholesale
Leavin' complex patterns all in your head so you know braille
And so frail rappers, y'all ain't Dance With Wolves
Just swimmin' with sharks, when the hammer get's pulled
Any witnesses? Who's tellin'? Nobody
The perfect crime, no autopsy, and no body
Without a neck you can't rock that chain
No way for air to get to your brain
Another murder for this Cuban to claim
An inconsiderate asshole pissin' on you
What else you expect? That's what a dickhead do
[Hook]
[Hot Karl]
Blao! Explosion, game on lock
Hotness, drop this, it's that sick hip hop
It's like blao!
[Fabolous]
I'm a coast to coast G, keep the toaster closely
So duck deez motherfucker
Blao!
[Redman]
Said it before, ready for war
With my sawed off shotgun, hand on the pump, pump
Blao!
[Celph Titled]
Slam my gat, I ain't hear to talk
You wanna make it gutter I can throw you off the sidewalk

[Verse Four: Redman]
Yo Doc, pee on your floor
I'mma be on the whore
Till she knocked out, then I take a G out her drawer
I'm a thief, on the streets you might be in the morgue
Doin' a chicken of course, I take a key out a Porsche-ah
Box 'em in claustrophobic
I'm a pro y'all, know this
When sensing y'all controllers
Grown men is talkin'
This the fast lane, move over to the margin
It's over when I walk in
"Doctor" on my license plate
The front of my truck resembles Mike Tyson face
When I pull up to the club, the buildin' shake
Hoes start runnin' out
Niggas start runnin' mouth
I'mma bolt the door and security the area
Got! We molt floors to secure the Dillinger
Yo Doc! You want war, I'll be sure to bury ya
The more the merrier, but your
Blao![Verse 1: Crypt the Warchild]
You ain't never seen life through the eyes of a killer
Same eyes looking at me, that's the guy in the mirror
High to the day I die, this how I'm living
Whiskey in a jar, been scarred since the beginning
Time to shut the game down, bottom of the ninth inning
Thoughts on losing everything, kind of got my mind spinning
Yeah, this that blood, sweat and tears
Picking out your enemies, sifting through your peers
See everything high-def, so it's crystal clear
Official pistol be the gang, yes, we are up in here
Forming like a pyramid, 'nother level 'nother tier
Running rebel clutching metal, murder everything that's near
I've been buried alive, they oughta unearth me
It's a little too late, for God to unbirth me
Please adhere, when I say I'm bloodthirsty
I'm on a killing spree, I show no mercy

[Hook x2: Planetary]
Ever looked into a killer's eyes?
Blood shot red, knowing that he ill advise
That's the way the Army play, we can never die
Reborn after death, we can't let it slide

[Verse 2: Celph Titled]
Throw my dirt by my lonesome, I'm the lone gunman
But I got shooters, call me if you need me to loan gun man (What you need?)
Move up the digital scale, they're not original
They're stale, we are the Army
We are embraced well (a-ha)
I make mail, screening on my cars
Next to my screened in pool
Collect property, put a lean on you (yeah)
Demons on my shoulder and they speak some
I don't believe in ghosts, I never seen one
The blunt contains ten grams
Pharaohs live show ten grands for each man, so I call Crypt and Plan
Officiate the pistols, feds fuck with this squadron
We'll melt the government office to a bubbling cauldron
Smoldering, smoking, oxygen tank explosions
Thrown thirty kilometers, dislodging your ribs open
These are the visions that I see in my dreams
Trained to kill since birth when AOTP's the team

[Hook x2: Planetary]

[Verse 3: Des Devious]
Yeah, it comes natural
Stalk a prey like a predator and then I capture you
The jux is the sweet part, I'm stomping your weak heart
Your team next to depart, they after you
AOTP not acquainted with fear
No, we on that Bonecrusher shit, nigga we are Never Scared
To put it to work, up that earth
Throw your body in and fill that hole back with dirt
For real, walk your verse with you, we let the things talk
Then outline you for the cops in pink sidewalk chalk
Cause you been a bitch
And we been some bitch killers since day one
Pass it down to my son
The day'll never come that I ain't strapped with a gun
Five-seven on me, always ready for whatever comes
All my bullets slug, got enough to spray for everyone
Three thirty round extended clips'll get the job done
Duck, run and hide, hide motherfucker, hide
Should've took heed when they told you I was ill advised
Taking off my shades so you can look into a killer's eyes
Official pistol gang, niggas specialize in homicide
Yeah
Official pistol gang, niggas specialize in homicide
Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrat!(apathy)
The almighty
Demigodz
Yo

Verse 1 (apathy)
Ever since the big bang
Before god had a name
Before the birth of earth
Or when the dinosaurs came
Way before cavemen were huntin prehistoric game
Or cleopatra pumped poison venom in her veins
Before the world changed when the romans reigned
Before jesus was slain and noah watched for rain
Cause I been waitin longer to drop my cd
Than people'll wait in line at the dmv

Verse 2 (celph titled)
Yo
Before the lord himself said let there be...
There was me celph titled
God emcee
No frequency to transmit
No hammers to grip
No flicks where they were killin kids on summer campin trips
Before you was cohereint
My flows spirit co-existed in pyramids
Temples of holy lyrics
Homey I'm serious
Before Jehovah thought of yall
I done payed dues
Blown the fuck up and fallen off
Come on

Chorus

Don't make me
Wait!
What will it
Take!
Let's get this
Straight!

Demigodz
Don't forget it or we gonna bring it!

Bring it back
Bring it, bring it, bring it back
Yea
Bring it back
Bring it, bring it, bring it back
Come on
Bring it back
Bring it, bring it, bring it back
Yea
Bring it back
Bring it, bring it, bring it back
Bring it

Verse 3 (ryu)
Before tats and the booze
Two packs a day shit
In the lunch room battlin chumps in they faces
Ever since cassettes
I was fresh before the phrase
"so fresh"
For my age I needed a fucking agent
>From out the basement
I came when kane did
Before k-swiss was gay kicks for gay kids
I'm saying!
For the sake of being abrasive
I'll slit a ho's throat so the bitch can't say shit

Verse 4 (motive)
Way before my mom used to beat me with a switch
Suspended from school
For callin all my teachers a bitch
Before I used to rock lee's and the creases was thick
The only time I dressed up was on easter and shit
Basically I'm sayin i've been patiently waitin a long time
Before my pops even thought about knockin up my mom
Before so many fake dudes tried to rhyme
The guarded angels got they ass whooped for stoppin crimes
Yea!

Chorus

Verse 5 (tak)
Before I was even concieved and kickin the womb
Before I was able to breathe I was diggin ya tomb
Before I even had a style and the clips to fill it with
Before my brother bilal left a hook with the syndicate
I was waitin in the shack with everlast
Way before he had knack
Way before it was cool to wear leather pants
Before lickin a line up came look at my number
Def jeff and drop rhymes on ya

Verse 6 (apathy)
Feels like centuries
Or essentially
Longer than flava flav waited for the ent
Before o.j. got lucky and lost his fresh prince
Before they tried to switch up the aunts on fresh prince
Before napoleon began to strategize
Or way before McDonalds fucked up they apple pies
Before capone committed a single crime
Bottom line i've been waitin a long fucking time

Chorus[Verse 1: Apathy]
I keep sub-woofers woofing like a werewolf, howling
The werewolf growling, rappers throw the towel in
I stand tall, towering
A giant, overpowering
Meet me outerspace where I'm meteor showering
Shoveling, dirt up in the cemetery
Scowling, crawling
Looking for a soul for devouring
Owls swoop down, grabbing rats off the ground
You can hear the bell toll twelve time's in the town
Now it's midnight, streets where them lost souls hitchhike
Hearts pump ice water, never been the bitch type
I fistfight with God, slap box with Amen Ra
I'm Allah, I'm a star armed robbing armored cars
Armoralled Audi villain
I'm a getaway driver
Loaded automatic in my leather jacket liner
Rap is like vagina, eat it, beat it, till it bleeds
Fill it full of seeds, keep the kingdom undeceased, hoes

[Verse 2: Lawrence Arnell]
I am surrounded by legends
Even when I don't fit in, I get in
You ain't gotta pat me down to find the weapon
Scott Stallone won't even adjust to settings
Before the Armageddon starts
The dark artists
I go the hardest, the farthest, after my target
So when I'm standing on a pyramid
Amongst the Army of the illest fucking lyricists
Chicken Little, be prepared for anything when the sky falls
You gon' have to fucking deal with it, all of y'all
My team's synonymous with fire pits
Branding irons, muzzle flash, crying kids
The catalyst, the arrogance, is brought upon
By the fact that nobody's ever proven me wrong
So fuck your song, fuck your albums and your rap career
You got a problem? I'll be right here

[Hook x2: Lawrence Arnell]
There's a war going on outside
You can either find a place to hide or start riding
Never the victim with my hands in the sky
When it's hammer time, racks'll slide
Leviathan

[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]
Yeah
I'm here to reincrease the murder rate
Smoking wakata on Zanzabar listen to purple tape (Raekwon The Chef!)
I don't like the shit that y'all regurgitate
Rearrange your face into a state to make the nurse's shake
Young bull run up on you, take your purch' and break
Eating fesenjan with four maghzi off a Persian plate
I don't listen to the music that you herb's create
Soft mahfucker sound like you rehearse with Drake (you fucking soft!)
It's wearing on me, I don't know how much my nerves can take
I guess being a bitch requires certain taste
I make the same incisions that a surgeon make
Two times too many, you don't get a third mistake
You ass betting so I know that you for certain snake
And I don't trust a mahfucker I'm immersed in hate
Colombo crime family, fuck around and burst your face
Allahu Akbar, blokka blokka burn his face

[Verse 4: Celph Titled]
Army of the murderers, mercenaries with no mercy
Soldiers that's so dirty, hold burners that hold thirty
Lock a corrupt officer in the corner with the ghost of Chris Dorner
And commence to piss on him (Think we won't?)
Your security; needs security
We damage 'em all, y'all building bird houses, your hammers is small
(Why they so small?)
I put the nozzle in your nasal hole
You break 'em down to grams baby we bake 'em whole
You ain't a O.G., you're the first to G.O
Speed off in a Geo and duck like Nat Geo
Shoot through your book, there's holes in your story
My young balls cracking skulls and they open 'em for me
Cut open three white keys with a white Continental GT key
For a three night spree out in Waikiki
And I repeat, when the iron start firing
You gon' hear my hollow spit bitch but I ain't Hawaiian

[Hook x2][Intro]
(It's nineteen ninety now and there's certain individuals
Swear they rollin' hard and get robbed on principle)

October 26
It's Nineteen Ninety Now, motherfuckers

[Verse 1]
So here I am, in the spot you probably wish you was
It's a few haters, but damn if I ain't getting love
You see my fan base, you see them quoting bars
You see them bringing up my name saying "He goin' hard"
He took some time to make an album
Now he's back in effect and motherfuckers wanna out him
A lot of rappers got my face on they dart board
But they don't start war cause I'm the hardest of the hardcore
Tin-man don't need foil, metallic, exo-skeleton when heat boils
Leave you in the sun till your meat spoils
The beat boils, Buckwild bakes the heat rocks
While you soft though, I'm pulling back the crossbow
(And y'all know)
The game's saturated and crowded
But you don't hear us bitching, instead we did something about it
Made an album with the same ingredients as many classics known
The golden era rap fans who love echoing saxophones

[Verse 2]
A concept first of it's kind
Imagine if we combine me, with the murderous rhymes and tracks from a earlier time
(oh yeah)
In the climate of rap where heads are lost
But over here we stay focused and make exactly what we want (yes)
Buck ain't just Diggin' The Crates (nah)
He dug straight into the shoe boxes of floppy discs
And found some jewels so I can rock the shit
Shout out to James D.L. for havin' a vision of a magical wizard castin' angry spells
Aimin' these shells at the state of rap music
Trying to change the people and trying to change they view of it
The faggot art nerds will say we're not progressive
But they don't realize this album is a highly focused weapon
Cause we'll get the props and my rep will grow bigger
My name everywhere will make these hoes bitter
And any and all attempts to stop my movement
I swear to God you'll have brain damage from head contusions

[Verse 3]
So my challenge to jealous rappers and wanna-bes:
Make a record better than Ninety Now then you can talk to me
And you can talk to Buck but he ain't working with you
Cause he made an album with me stating facts that mostly dissed you
When flipping the flim flam, call yourself a big fan
But never spend a dime on the music, you'se a bitch man
So if I gotta sell crack to get rich
Well, I'm cooking up the fish scale and rock it like it's Ishmael
Either that or get my stage so mad amped up
Busting black hammers with choreographed dancers
I am the answer to every whack rappers demo song
Cause I am the fresh maker like the fucking Mentos song
October 26th a renaissance begins to work
Doin' shit so big I take one step and fall off of the Earth
We on a motherfucking murder spree
Give constructive criticism and I'll give you reconstructive surgery

[Interlude]
Yo, Buck, we gotta give 'em one more man
Throw your L's up for this one
Rest in peace Big L, yeah

[Verse 4]
Yo, listen, it don't take fear to fear us
You fuckin' with an evil spirit that don't appear in mirrors
You wouldn't want to be a fly on the wall, I'm grabbing a swatter
Swing it harder than the kick back to a Magnum Revolver
Yes I'm just awful, a God not a phony
Menage with your wife and I bought your daughter a pony
Officers know me as "That's that motherfucking guy"
Shoot a pec or a thigh, don't mean shit if you a muscle guy
My guns are more than a friend
On time at your door with a nine and a .45 at a quarter 'till ten
I seal Navy Seals, seen a whole army's intestines
And choked enemy soldiers till they had Barney's complexion
One harmless suggestion is get your speech right
My scrap napkin verses smoke what you took a week to write
You like butt cheeks tight, it ain't hard to tell
You been through more manholes than Donatello and Raphael

Faggot[Celph Titled talking]
Stupid motherfuckers. Run, duck, and hide, die motherfucker die
(Let em know, Celph) It's time to bust some heads in. (Let's go.) Oh yeah
It is the Army. Blaaaat!

[Hook: Celph Titled]
Hard to the motherfucking core we are
The federated army of the Pharaoh murderer squad
Run run
We gonna tear the head piece up
Uh huh, you don't want beef because

Vinnie I had enough of them, yo bust 'em in
Vinnie I had enough of them, yo bust 'em in
Bust, bust 'em in
Bust, bust 'em in
Bust, bust 'em in
Bust, bust 'em in

[Verse 1: Reef The Lost Cauze]
A.O.T.P
Fresh Nikes and ice links
You won't feel till after the punch like a spiked drink
Sipping Goose till my eyes pink
Ninety-five live rings
Real niggas survive things and die kings
I can hear dead homie sayin' "Yo you owe it to me."
So it's no holds barred like the old Hulk Hogan movie
You got a heart homeboy? Well yo show it to me
The flow's majestic, I spit a roll of golden rubies
I'm old school like roll a doobie
Daddy-O my hoes is groovy, pay my rent with dough from groupies
A pimp and a killer, gorilla your project
Nine milli really only defense of my logic
The shotgun just sits in the closet
Waiting for you fuckers to come dip in my shit
Nonsense
The weak could never stop the thorough
Bitch niggas suspect, I call them boys Gossip Girls

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Apathy]
I treat fools like bitches cause I always got a few biscuits
And bus(t) 'em in like kids from different school districts
Y'all dip shits will get your spinal discs flipped
Rhymes will make the vinyl disc skip, find your wrists slit
Nickel-plated nine shine like diamonds on Slick Rick
I'm wicked as a Wiccan bitch when the candle wick's lit
Want to sample this shit? You need to read Sanskrit
And travel to the top of Mount Sinai to transmit
Running through the Red Seas like an escaped slave
Then holding up the walls of water with my sound waves
Like what I was doing during Public Execution
Half-human, half-mutant, Ap must be the Rasputin
Gats shooting, shots ricocheting off of my steel body
And three quarter length Fat Goose to conceal shotties
If God walks the surface of the sun it won't melt feet
Cause when's the last time you heard Ap rip a Celph beat?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Celph Titled]
I'm a five-star general, the motherfucking main man
Flip a bird, hold a swammy with the same hand
And do a rain dance when blood splatters and sprays
Cement mixing your IV, turn your Anatomy Grey
Nobody ratted at A-
O.T.P. Not Treach with O.P.P
I'm obsessed with O.C.D
A temperamental mental patient
With cyberkenetic on-board computer integration
One of rap's most innovative voices and flows
In front of missile-command buttons
I look around, all my choices just blow
So now you should know
I'm the don of braggadocio flamethrowing
I'm Cobra Kai and I'm keeping that dojo name going
Come down and sign up, I'm training soldiers to rhyme rough
And get they punchlines up
Cause you ain't fucking with the gold beard Rubix Cuban nowhere
No rapper is nowhere near what I just wrote here
Oh yeah

[Outro: Vinnie Paz]
Yeah. A.O.T.P. Pharaoh clique. Philly to Beantown
To Connecticut. To fuckin' Tampa. We worldwide baby
Official pistol gang. Braaaat!Hook
"You can fool the last one but you can't fool me"
"can't fool me" (x3)
"You can fool the last one but you can't fool"
The simple fact it's the G-O-Ds"

[Verse 1: Apathy]
This is the hardest record all year, mark my words
From the dark I emerge power sparks the surge
Got juggernaut strength lift buildings with both hands
Crush a tank like a child stepping on coke cans
Gigantic beasts must be out of my mind
Electrically charged I jump rope with live powerlines
On some real shit, body made of steel shit
Travel with more nines than "bring your 4th graders on a field trip"

[Verse 2: Blacastan]
You never heard a nigga that can spit it like Blac could
Fiend out niggas steaming crack in they back woods
Grew up in a black hood, rocking a black hood
Rhymed on a corner til my rap got good
I studied the art like you should
Rhyme for rhyme I abuse it, get used up
Please don't confuse us
For happy niggas at the back of the bus
Get your green bags up and in Demigodz we trust

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Esoteric]
I'm sick and twisted like a juggalo with aids
Or a Stephen King page or a dying grandmother growing braids
I'm so driven I get road rage on stage
Thoughts, liquid crack, I move liters like motorcades
I've been on plenty tours dealing with these crazy whores
They need their head examined like the AVN awards
I'm '87 wars, pick apart you bastards
On a powertrip like Ahmadinejad on acid

[Verse 4: Motive]
Not with the fooling with hard spitting hooligan
When he's out they like, "Aw shit it's you again?"
They can't stand me, I'm known to keep a slammy
The only thing you pack on your hip is a fanny
Doeraker pharmacist, paper become anonymous
Flow so psychotic bitch, lyrically we opposites
In other words y'all can't tell me shit
You pay the same price that the deer caught up in the headlights did

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Eternia]
You cannot attempt to meet at the mountain I’m on
I climb higher than the rapper you just smoked out to get on your song
Thinking you're on, you're more off than a circuit that's blown
After a storm I'm that verbal hurricane then I'm gone
Don't pretend that you matter you don't
I'd rather speak the truth than leave you out for the choke
And besides you need some lessons my suggestion is nope
Don't do it your intentions are mess and I see through it

[Verse 6: Celph Titled]
IED under your SUV, escalate your Escalade
Fucking fag, I got a duffle bag full of 'nades
Add a clip, and some track, what I'm aiming at
Failed arithmetic but at marksmanship I'm a brainiac
Suffocate, twist, and arch your throat
Maybe you should dip because I mastered the art of choke
Start to provoke, talk loud or try to speak out
I'll break your arm like Sean Combs did to Steve Stoute

[Hook][Verse 1: Apathy]
Yeah...
I'm like a '88 classic, Apathy goes back
To Fila's with straps and Don Mattingly throwbacks
I'm back bitch, on some asshole rap shit
Rarely ever seen like Asian dudes with black chicks
You muthafuckas wanna scrap? Be quiet!
You know when Apathy drops, you happily buy it
All these cats are a riot, wanna rap, so they try it
But'll quit as quick as Ruben Studdard on the Atkins diet
I ain't the type to blow scratch on tricks
Slap tricks in the trap if teeth scratch the dick
Chicken's in the kitchen makin' chicken from scratch and shit
Check it, Chum's on the track with the scratch and mix
Y'all don't even understand who you scrappin' with
I got Timbs in the trunk, won't scratch my kicks
Y'all are brewin' up a plot, tryin' to get Ap to flip?
Do yourself a favor - scratch that shit, cause...

[Hook]
Even though muthafuckas tryin' to see me...
"Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me" [- Jay-Z
The way I think, I make it look easy
"Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me" [- Jay-Z
You got doubts, but please believe me
"Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me" [- Jay-Z
Go ask your mom to cop this CD
"Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me" [- Jay-Z

[Verse 2: Celph Titled]
The Rubix Cuban's at your door, but I ain't singin' no carols
I'm like Donkey Kong, I got you niggas dodgin' my barrels
Don't give a fuck where your label's from
We runnin' up in your office, holdin' your CEO hostage with a staple gun
And ain't no stoppin' this don; I got soccer moms
Puttin' Glocks in their palms and wildin' out to opera songs
Blow off your brim, turn your fitted to a kufi
I'm like Ricky Ricardo except, "I Love Uzis"
When I'm in the crowd, these rappers are shook
They won't stage dive unless they got a harness with a grapplin' hook
Damn right, my raps are real ill
The Celph Titled talkin' doll says, "Kill, kill"
Oh, you's a tough guy, sayin' that you brawl in these fights?
But you got your nose broken by a white bitch from a volleyball spike
Old timers ask me where I got my pimp game from
Cause I got 99 bitches and ain't a problem with one

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ryu]
I'm the one to call when your third verse is free
Slip slugs in a pump and disperse emcees
Six gunner with a potty mouth, spittin' up mud
I stay trippin' with a 40 oz., sippin' them suds
Outta Cali with a bang, bitch! Fuckin' insane, bitch
The man savin' L.A., forget about Game, bitch
I never claim Crip, but I'll murder my language
If I can't handle it quick, I'll have it arranged then
Last nine summers, you been suckin' the same dick
But Jay's gone, and I'm still fuckin' 'em brainless
At the Holiday Inn, my Doc Holiday grins
A little too much for one, so I'll probably get twins
Let the party begin, take it back to the telly
Your body is doper than coke, but your crack is smelly
At the show, they was rippin' all their panties and bras down
They love it, cause officially I'm one of the 'godz now

[Hook]
