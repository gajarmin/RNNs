[Bobby Seale speaking:]
Do you know what we are going to do? We are going to defend ourselves because Huey P. Newton says that, "Power is the ability to define phenomena and make it act in a desired manner." Power is the ability to define phenomena and make it act in a desired manner. Power: if we have the ability to define it, the only next thing to do is get organized. So when a pig walks up to you, or when a pig gets to jiving with the people you be so organized you be learning some tactics, you be learning some revolutionary principles, you be having some guns hid out somewhere, you have some proper tactics that when the pig gets to jiving with you, the pig is wrong, you whip your guns out on him, blow him a-way, and then you have made the ability, in fact, you have made that pig act in a desired manner

[Intro]
Smokin' a fat spliff in a brand new Benz
No I.D. on the track let the story begin, begin

[Verse 1]
Looking in the mirror but I don't see much
Still running the streets so I don't sleep much
Watching the snakes so they don't creep up, but the way
I'm gettin this money niggas can't keep up, you niggas can't keep up
Niggas got beef but it can’t be much
I'm still walking through the crowds like I can't be touched
Top back all black Gretzky puck
Ice skater lil' later might let me fuck, damn she might let me fuck
Last night I cried tears of joy
What did I do to deserve this?
Vacheron on my wrist a year ago
I didn't even know the bitch exist
Quarter milli for the mothafucka
No insurance on the mothafucka
Ain't life a bitch, but you gotta keep her wet
Keys open doors so I gotta keep a set
Everybody know that I'm a lotta people's threat
Biggie Smalls in the flesh livin' life after my death
Yesterday I read my horoscope
Tell me Lord will I be poor and broke
Tell me Lord will I be dealing dope
I wanna take my momma to the Poconos, but only the Lord knows

[Hook: Cee-Lo]
To all the loved ones I leave behind
At least they can't see me cry
And I ask, when someone wants to be me why
Thought having everything would ease my mind
If you could read my mind
My God, I'm scarred, I have tattoo tears of joy

[Verse 2]
Last night I cried tears of joy
What did I do to deserve this?
Young rich motherfucker still uneducated
But dammit a nigga made it, goddamn a nigga made it
Crib bigger than a church, Lord know I'm blessed
Five different lawyers, Lord know I’m stressed
A punch in the face get you 300K, ask Vlad
Now he back to making minimum wage, another victim of my criminal ways
I wanna walk in the image of Christ
But that bitch Vivica nice
And I'm still swimming in ice
I'm just living my life, I'm just living my life
Lease a Lamborghini for your pussy rate
Life is just a pussy race
Snatch a bitch take her back to your place
Next morning I can tell you how the pussy taste, I got expensive taste

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Last night I cried tears of joy
What did we do to deserve this?
Not to dwell on the the past but to keep it real
I gotta represent for Emmett Till, all the dead souls in the field
Lookin at my Rollie it's about that time
White man had a problem with mine
And we suppose to be shy?
The revolutions televised, Bobby still on the rise

[Hook][Verse 1 - Kid Cudi]
What up
How is everyone doing
You are now in the world I am ruling
Take a minute to adjust for the wonderous
Clusterfuck of fun and enchantment
I promise you some Generation-Next shit
Speak for the seller who I left with
Parallel levels in the dark, dark place
Tricked all you niggas to a dark, dark fate
And guided you all with a smile up on my face
As the sun kisses us on the foreheads gently
Gentle with the drugs, heavy with the love
And my speeches on stage rock mountains from a club
Money doesn't move me except on the literal
G4 flights, now we're off to Australia
I wanna see more of the world
These are more than just words, these are facts from a winner

[Refrain: Cee-Lo]
This is a journey into the horizon
You can see past if it's real to you
We can meet on the other side
On the other side

[Verse 2]
What up
How is everyone feeling
I hope you understand what you're hearing
Take a minute to roll up for the wonderous
Clusterfuck of darkness and evil
I will paint the Yin and the Yang for you
And my jeans are Dior for the love of skinnies
Upgraded, fitted into the T
Work hard, make sure I don't become a memory
Hard to press on when the memories remember me
And they always find the perfect moment
High speed, my momentum won't slow up none
Lost in the wind, I've lost all my friends
Maybe they were never meant to be acquainted
Money seems to make everything tainted
Everybody mad cause they stuck
Where I knew em last
Took what I wanted and I did it all blunted

[Refrain][Hook : Cee-Lo]
Nigga, you need to git up, git out and git something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't spend all your time trying to get high
You need git up, git out and git something
How will you make it if you never even try
You need to git up, git out and git something
Cause you and I got to do for you and I

[Verse 1: Cee-Lo]
I don't recall, ever graduating at all
Sometimes I feel I'm just a disappointment to y'all
Every day, I just lay around then I can't be found
Always asking "gimme some", living life like a bum
Times is rough, my auntie got enough problems of her own
Nigga, you supposed to be grown
I agree, I try to be the man I'm 'posed to be
But negativity is all you seem to ever see
I admit, I've done some dumb shit, and I'm probably gon do some mo'
You shouldn't hold that against me though (Why not?)
Why not? My music's all that I got
But some time must be invested for this to be manifested
I know you know but I'm gon' say this to you I...
Get high but I don't get too high
So what's the limit 'posed to be?
That must be why you can't get your ass up out the bed before three
You need to git up, git out, cut that bullshit out
Ain't you sick and tired of having to do without
Damn, what up with all these questions?
You act as though you know something I don't
Do you have any suggestions?
Cause every job I get is cruel and demeaning
Sick of taking trash out and toilet bowl cleaning
But I'm also sick and tired of struggling
I never ever thought I'd to have resort to drug smuggling
Naw, that ain't what I'm about
Cee-Lo will just continue traveling his route without any doubt
Or fear, I know the Lord ain't brought me this far so he could drop me off here
Did I make myself clear?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Well, uh, get up, stand up, so what's said, you dickhead
See when I was a youngster, used to wear them fucking Pro Keds
My mama made me do it, but the devil, he made me smart
Told me to jack them weak ass niggas for they fucking Starters
In the middle school, I was a bigger fool
I wore with tank tops to show off my tattoo, thought I was cool
I used to hang out with my daddy's brothers, I call them my uncles
They taught me how to smoke herb, I followed them when they ran numbers
So in a sense I was Rosemary's baby
And then, I learned the difference between a bitch and a lady
Hell, I treat 'em all like hoes, see I pimped 'em
Bitch never had my money, so I never whipped 'em
See all the playas came and all the playas went
A playa ain't a gangsta but a playa can handle his shit bitch
You need to git up, git out, git something
Smoke out, cause it's all about money, money, money
Yeah I said it, a nigga sporting plaits and a Braves hat
I hang with Rico Wade cause the Dungeon is where the funk's at, boy
I'm true to Organized, cause they raised me
I'm also down with LaFace cause L.A. Reid, yeah, he pays me
And it's cool
Yeah, it's real cool, getting paid fat pockets
And all that other fat shit like that, ha-ha

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Gipp]
A lot of people in my past tried to do me, screw me
Throw me over in the fire, let me get chunky and charred
Like a piece of wood and them spirits got the mutant's mind
I'm getting paranoid and steady looking for the time
It's eight in the morning and ain't nobody up yet
I got my long johns, get my coat and throw on my ball cap
I'm headed out the door, to get off in my ride
I'm digging through the ash tray, hoping to have a good day
I had Jamaica's best and when I light it up, I hear a voice in my head
(You got to git up, git out and git something)
Now I know it's on, my day is finally started
Back up in my crib, eat my shit, break out quick, in my slick
'84 Se-dan DeVille, steady bouncing
Out the Point to Campbellton Road
The valley of the Southside flow
Everybody know about that killa that we call blow, so
Keep your eyes peeled for the COBRA unit
Cause they known for jumping out of black Chevy trucks and through the fog
Here come the Red Dogs, I'm busting out around the corner in my hog
Dipping from the area, I'm scared
So one of these bitches might wind up dead
Cause I have no time for jail; fuck Clampett cops; fuck Eldrin Bell
And crooked ass Jackson, got the whole country
Thinking that my city is the big lick for '96
'94, Big Gipp, Goodie Mo, OutKast, a vision from the past
Hootie Hoo, my White Owls are burning kind of slow

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Andre 3000]
Y'all telling me that I need to get out and vote, huh. Why?
Ain't nobody black running but crack-kers, so, why I got to register?
I thinking of better shit to do with my time
Never smelled aroma of diploma, but I write the deep ass rhymes
So let me take ya way, back to when a nigga stayed in Southwest Atlanta, ay
Y'all could not tell me nothing, thought I hit that bottom rock
At age 13, start working at the loading dock
They laying my mama off of work, General Motors tripping
But I come home banked like Hank, from licking and dipping
Doing dumb shit, not knowing what a nigga know now
Yeah, that petty shit will have you cased up and locked down
I dips, over to East Point, still actin a fool
Wasting my time in the school, I'd rather be shooting pool
Cool is how I played the tenth grade
I thought it was all about macking hoes and wearing pimp fade
Instead of being in class, I'd rather be up in some ass
Not, thinking about them six courses that I need to pass
Graduation rolled around like rolly-pollies
Damn, that's fucked up. I should've listened when my mama told me
That, if you play now, you gonna suffer later
Figured she was talking yang yang, so I payed her no attention
And kept missing the point she tried to poke me with
The doper that I get, the more I'm feeling broke and shit
Huh, but that don't matter though, I am an O-UT-KAST
So get up off your ass

[Hook][Hook: Cee-Lo]
His name's, DOOM
They wonder just who is he
But don't worry
Believe me he'll get busy
When it comes to
Poetry he's got plenty
La la lah... la la la la lah

[Verse 1: MF Doom]
Jump 'em in like jump rope, double dutch
Then turn on the mic with a thumb stroke, subtle touch
Cuddle clutch, is this thing on?
Like the fling with Mrs. King Kong, this spring gone?
Sing a song of slaphappy crappiness
He came to blow like it was strapped to his nappy chest
Surely I jest, the best on a wireless mic
Not an eye test, yet I di-gress
But why stress? Try and remember when
Maybe bit the tender skin-ned babysitter Gwendolyn
The type to hit and run and go tell a friend
Word to El Muerto cucaracha exoskeleton
He know, flow like interstellar wind
Tow a rap djinn by his toe into hell again
{*ahem*} One two, check me too
Loose wreck see through your goose-neck EQ

[Hook]

[Verse 2: MF Doom]
Ay! If I may interject
Rap these days is like a pain up in the neck
Cornier and phonier than a play fight
Take two of these and don't phone me on the late night
The beat won't fail me
With more rhymes than times he washed his hands and feet daily
And all that kerosene ain't cheap
Villain been deep since a teenage creep
Peep - he always was a gentleman
And kept the pen and a pencil in his mental den
Right there next to where the Rolodex was
Before it turned up all burnt by his solar plexus
He don't know his own strength
When he's on the bone it's like the microphone's length
And width, ain't it funky like dingy socks?
Feel the full effect off cassette in your Benzie Box

[Hook][Twista talking]
Man, I know we had a lot of tragedies lately
I just wanna say rest in peace to Aaliyah
Rest in peace to Left Eye
Rest in peace to Jam Master Jay
And everybody lost in the Twin Towers
And everybody lost period
All we got is hope

[Verse 1: Twista]
I wish the way I was living could stop, serving rocks
Knowing the cops is hot when I'm on the block, And I
Wish my brother woulda made bail
So I won't have to travel 6 hours to see him in jail, And I
Wish that my grandmother wasn't sick
Or that we would just come up on some stacks and hit a lick, And I (I wish)
Wish my homies wouldn't have to suffer
When the streets get the upper hand on us and we lose a brother, And I
Wish I could go deep in a zone
And lift the spirits of the world with the words with in this song, And I (I wish)
Wish I could teach us all to fly
Take away the pain out cha hands and help you hold them high, And I
Wish God never gave the men power
To be able to hurt the people inside the Twin Towers, And I (I wish)
Wish God woulda turned they hearts righteous
When they started to take innocent lives and become snipers, But uh
We will never break, though they devastate, we shall motivate
And we gotta pray, all we got is faith
Instead of thinking about who gonna die to day
The Lord is gonna help you feel better, so you ain't gotta cry today
Sit at the light so long
And then we gotta move straight forward, cuz we fight so strong
So when right go wrong
Just say a little prayer, get ya money man, life go on
Let's hope

[Hook:]
Cuz I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away
And be hopeful (hopeful) and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay
Let's be hopeful

[Verse 2: Twista]
I wish that you could show some love
Instead of hatin so much when you see some other people comin up (I wish)
I wish I could teach the world to sing
Watch the music and have 'em trippin of the joy I bring, (shiit)
I wish that we could hold hands
Listen instead of dissin lessons from a grown man, And I (I wish)
Wish the families that lack, but got love, get some stacks
Brand new shack and a lack that's on dubs, And I
Wish we could keep achieving wonders
See the vision of the world through the eyes of Stevie Wonder, (you feel me) (I wish)
And I hope all the kids eat
And don't nobody in my family see six feet, (ya dig)
I hope them mothers staying strong
You can make it whether you wit him or your man's gone, And I (I wish)
Wish I could give every celly some commissary
And the po po bring the heat on them priests like they did R. Kelly
And I wish that D.O.C. could scream again
And bullets could reverse so Pac and Biggie breath again, (shit) (I wish)
Then one day they could speak again
I wish that we only saw good news every time we look at CNN
I wish that enemies could talk
And that super homie Christopher Reeve could still walk, (I wish)
I wish that we could walk a path, stay doin the right thing
Hustle hard so the kids maintain up in the game
Let's hope

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: Twista]
Wish the earth wasn't so apocalyptic
I try to spread my message to the world the best way I can give it
We can make it always so optimistic
If you don't listen gotta live my life the best way I can live it
I pray for justice when we go to court
Wish it was all good so the country wouldn't have to go to war
Why can't we kick it and just get em on
And in the famous words of Mr. King "Why can't we all just get along"
Or we can find a better way to shop and please, And I
Hope we find a better way to cop a keys, And I
Wish everybody would just stop and freeze
And ask way are we fulfillin these downfalls and prophecies
You can be wrong if it's you doubting
With the faith of a mustard seed you can move mountains
And only the heavenly father and ease the hurt
Just let it go and keep prayin on your knees in church
And let's hope

[Hook: x2]

I see you driving around town with the girl I love
And I'm like, "Fuck you" (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like: "fuck you," and fuck her, too
Said if I was richer
I'd still be with ya
Hah, now ain't that some shit?
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best
With a fuck you (oh, ooh, oooh)

[Verse 1]
Yeah I'm sorry, I can't afford a Ferrari
But that don't mean I can't get you there
I guess he's an Xbox and I'm more Atari
But the way you play your game ain't fair

[Bridge]
I pity the fool that falls in love with you
(Oh shit, she's a gold digger)
Well.. (just thought you should know nigga)
I've got some news for you
("...Yeah, go run and tell your little boyfriend")

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Now I know that I had to borrow
Beg and steal and lie and cheat
Trying to keep ya, trying to please ya
Cause being in love with your ass ain't cheap

[Bridge]
I pity the fool that falls in love with you
(Oh shit, she's a gold digger)
Well (just thought you should know nigga)
I've got some news for you
("...Ooh, I really hate yo' ass right now")

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now baby, baby, baby, why d'you wanna wanna hurt me so bad?
I tried to tell my momma but she told me
"This is one for your dad"
(Your dad, your dad, your dad)
Why? Uh! Why? Uh!
Why lady? Oh I love you
Oh, I still love you, ooh

[Hook][Verse 1: André 3000]
And there's a fine line between love and hate you see
Came way too late, but baby I'm on it..
And there's a fine line between love and hate you see
Came way too late, but baby I'm on it..
Can't worry bout, what a nigga think now see
That's Liberation and baby I want it..
Can't worry bout, what anotha nigga think
Now that's Liberation and baby I want it..

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
(Let me hear it, let me hear it, let me hear those, let me hear those)
How many times I, sit back and contemplate
I'm fresh off the dank, but I'm tellin my story..
My relationship, with my folks is give and take
And I done took so much, now give me my glory
Now have a choice to be who you wants to be
It's left uppa to me, and my momma n'em told me (yes she did)
I said I have a choice to be who you wants to be
It's left uppa to me, and my momma n'em told me

[Verse 3: Cee-Lo]
No, nooo, noooooooo
I'm so tired, it's been so long - struggling, hopelessly
Seven and forty days.. heyyy
Ohhhh, I sacrifice every breath I breathe
To make you believe, I'd give my life awayyyy
Oh lord, I'm so tired, I'm so tired
My feet feel like I walked most of the road on my owwwwn
All on my owwwwn, weeeeeee..
We alive or we ain't livin, that's why I'm givin until it's gone
Cause I don't wanna be alone (I don't wanna be alone)
I don't wanna be alone.. yeahhhheeeeee
If there's anything I can say, to help you find your way
Touch your soul, make it whole, the same for you and I..
There's not a minute that goes by that I don't believe
That you die.. but I can feel it in the wind
The beginning or the end
But people keep your head to the skyyyyy

[Singers in background over interlude]
Shake that load off, shake that load off (16X)

[Verse 4: Erykah Badu]
Folk in your face, you're a superstar
Niggas hang around cause of who you are
You get a lot of love cause of what you got
Say they happy for you but they really not
Sell a lot of records and you roll a Benz
Swoll up in the spot, now you losing friends
All you wanna do is give the world your heart
Record label tried to make you compromise your art
You make a million dollars, make a million mo'
First class broad treat you like a nigga po'
You wanna say "Wait!" but you're scared to ask
As your world starts spinning and it's moving fast
Tryin' to stay sane is the price of fame
Spending your life trying to numb the pain
You shake that load off and sing your song
Liberate the minds, then you go on home..

[Verse 5: Big Rube]
I must admit, they planted a lot of things
In the brains and the veins of my strain
Makes it hard to refrain, from the host of cocaine
From them whores, from the flame
From a post in the game
Makes it hard to maintain focus
They're from the Glock rounds, and lockdowns, and burials
The seeds that sow, get devoured by the same locusts
Cause it's a hard row to ho
If your ass don't move, and the rain don't fall
And the ground just dry
But the roots are strong, so some survive
So you're surprised, now I'm bustin cries
You got more juice than Zeus
Slangin lightnin tryin to frighten
Plains dwellers, of the Serengeti
But get beheaded when you falsely dreaded
Melanin silicon and collagen injected
Dissectin my pride, fool I don't wanna get it started
We be the lionhearted, without a fantasy
It's like that red sprite, you can't imagine it
Unless you lookin at the canvas of life
And not through the peephole of mortality
Single minded mentality
Gettin over on loopholes
Gettin paid two-fold on technicalities
Clickin your heels, scared to voice how you feel
Packing steel
Pickin cotton from the killing fields with no toe, though
I don't we in Kansas no mo' though
Midwest or Dirty South
Clean dressed or dirty mouth
Whether robbin preachers or killin Poor Righteous Teachers
You a scared demon
Shouldn't be allowed to spread semen
And you cowardly lions never defyin the jackals who babble
Runnin with they pack, tail between your legs
Though the mane on your head say the story
As you downplay your glory
Cacklin, helpin the shacklin of your brethern happen
Just by rappin..
LIBERTAD..[Thoughts from MauSe]

Interviewer: Mr. President, in talking about the continuing recession tonight, you have blamed mistakes of the past, and you have blamed the congress. Does any of the blame belong to you?

Ronald Reagan: Yes because for many years, I was a Democrat

Crowd: *laughs*

[Verse 1]
They say illuminati's in the air
That's why the dollar bill has an eye
What if I told you that I didn't care?
Because the pyramid doesn't cry
Which means they don't see the kids grieve
In the inner cities, that they let the outsiders blitzkrieg
But the outsiders get these, warrants to get things all up in the mean streets
Commentary on the brick wall
They made it monetary off a pitfall
Kids see they mom and daddy all piss poor
Pitchforks in they arm, on the floor, rent gone
My mask up, as I tag up
Letting my views breathe life on the canvas
The fast buck put doom on my friends so I pray
But I still see grins everyday

[Hook]
& I can tell you know how hard this life can be...
But you keep on smiling for me
But the 3rd 3y3, never smiles
The 3rd 3ye, 3rd 3y3, never smiles
Keep on smiling for me
The 3rd 3y3, never smiles
The 3rd 3ye, 3rd 3y3, never smiles

[Verse 2]
Food stamps and welfare
That's what they giving us from Congress
They say you can't be helped here
I swear I think we need a conference
Conquests of areas breed conflict
And conflict makes convicts
Photo shoots for con flicks
It's like a jail contest
Pro's and cons for a congruent conscious
The concept of my spirit is acrylic
I let my art speak and my hear just mimics
Political cynics believe in a little pillage
But to raise one child it takes a small village
Mother on the corner tryna make money
Her slogan is ain't nothing that they can take from me
Things are rough right now, please pray for me
She just smirked as she waved to me

[Hook]
& I can tell you know how hard this life can be...
But you keep on smiling for me
But the 3rd 3y3, never smiles
The 3rd 3ye, 3rd 3y3, never smiles
Keep on smiling for me
The 3rd 3y3, never smiles
The 3rd 3ye, 3rd 3y3, never smiles

[Verse 3]
From Staten Island to Astoria
My 3y3's look at the government getting cornier
MauSe, I swear it feels ima foreigner
So many secrets Victoria, isn't sure of the
Signs, they hang in front of our 3y3's without a corridor
They all look at us blind but we are warriors
Can you dig it? They dominating
This is a fruit fight, let's impeach Ronald Reagan

[Hook]

[Outro: Ronald Reagan]
One of my favorite quotations about age, comes from Thomas Jefferson, he said that "We should never judge a president by his age only by his work." And ever since he told me that, I've stopped worrying. Just to show you how youthful I am, I plan to campaign in all 13 states

Crowd: *laughs*[Cee-Lo 1st verse]
Hey, the sun is shining looking like another wonderful day
Look through my sweet collection trying to find some good music to play
While I'm getting ready to face the world
Doing what I must do..know sugar
Nothing compares to waking up this morning to you

[Hook]
Good morning
Baby, how you been?
Did you sleep well last night honey?
Well I'm off to work again

[Cee-Lo 2nd verse]
Listen I'll call you later
Maybe we can get something to eat
How about our favorite restaurant darling
Where we usually eat
I said whew! Umm um sure looking mighty fine
I can hardly wait for quitting time

[Hook]
Good afternoon baby
I sure missed you while I was gone
But you know I got to work honey, Hey let's just do something later on

[Cee-Lo 3rd verse]
Let's go for a walk nothing gets you in the mood better than a little moonlight
Um hmm, or we can rent some movies and make it a blockbuster night, Hey
Does that sound interesting baby? Sound like an idea?
I would gladly walk you home but you're already here

[Hook]
Good night baby
I spent the whole day with my friend
Hopefully God will wake me up baby to see you in the morning

[Bridge]
Oh child
Oh because you everything, everything, everything to me
Oh yeah girl I need your love each and everyday Hey
Hmm, child
Hhmmmmmmmmm
Good night baby[Intro: Cee-Lo]
It's 6 O'clock, it's volume 1
Yeah, Greg Street's mixtape

[Verse One: Boondox]
Uh uh
I came up in the hood infested with teenage hustlers
Street grinders, paper chasin scrapin busters
By keepin dust up noses and caine homes; pipes and cans
So they want they ride candy painted just like the man
That Veta tryin not to bite his hand
But they need em to keep em life from they stand
Every night praying for praying go as far as the ceiling
Got me feel like I'm (cursed) from this heart that I'm dealing
And all this liquor hoeing brother and goose-neckin
That I do but I don't want to got me losing blessings
GOD said he'll take the next two steps if I take the first (I did)
But in it to pick and sellin the spur
From under my feet, lost faith and jump in the street
Back to serve a rocks dying to the chrome in the heat
And running with G's that take it to the block with 'em
Tellin me along with my greens up like pot nickel

[Hook: Cee-Lo]
Well, all I know
That I'd been down this road before
It ain't the first time, won't be the last
I gotta slow down cause I'm living too fast
It's time to admit I need some help
Still living with my momma, can't feed myself
Life ain't about who straight, who real, who fake, and who gay
It's about who pray

[Verse Two: Cee-Lo]
You can clock my consistent and endless
Efforts up uplift me
Trees and branches catch draft
When I'm choppin down a path-
To walk down, actually don't even know how talk sound
I'm trying to stop the next step they drawing the chalk round
Matter-of-factually, I'll stand alone with no entourage to back me
GOD is my every existence; exhalation, exactly
I'll pimp prophets so profounding labels don't like contract me
I'm one of a kind; they gotta find a satellite to contact me
Let us bow, I thank the Almighty GOD for right now
For the strictor, smile through the tribulation and trial
For sparing me when the devil was daring me
And scaring me, synonymous for preparing me
And to my family- the Dungeon Family
And ya'll family-- we all family
And to me health and home and my son Kingston
My tongue is my gun, revolutions already begun
(Whaa)

[Hook: Cee-Lo]
Well, all I know
That I'd been down this road before
It ain't the first time, won't be the last
I gotta slow down cause I'm living too fast
It's time to admit I need some help
Still living with my momma, can't feed myself
Life ain't about who straight, who real, who fake, and who gay
It's about who pray

[Verse Three: Kalage]
All I know is charge cards, cars, and clothes
Maan, it's all for sure
And could go and when it's gone- (you alone)
Runnin up yo cell phone callin GOD for hope
And who to say that day ain't all awful close
And if you ballin playa, it's only because GOD's your coach
And it don't bout the lies you hold, laws you broke
Thangs ya drink, dank and cigars you smoke
HE gonna forgive and that's you; now don't get me wrong
I like LL, but GOD da G.O.A.T'
HE da greatest of all time, if I'm lying I'm blind
Can I get a Amen (Amen brother)
But we got to stop, we got to stop doin dirt
Coming to Church with a devil tucked in your purse
Sister Samantha from Atlanta, can't even much finish her prayer, Worried about what Sister Martha wear
All along worried bout what sister mom gonna wear
This ya boy or should they ride the martyr there
It don't matter at least that's the moral there
In Sunday service with a Bible lie defer the South
But GOD bless her, we here to thank GOD (hmmmm ahhh)
And that's the step inside Holy Church thinkin
I said step inside his Holy Church thinkin
We all God's Property, and not just Kirk Franklin

[Hook: Cee-Lo]
Well, all I know
That I'd been down this road before
It ain't the first time, won't be the last
I gotta slow down cause I'm living too fast
It's time to admit I need some help
Still living with my momma, can't feed myself
Life ain't about who straight, who real, who fake, and who gay
It's about who pray

[T.I. and studio engineers interlude convo]

[Verse Four: T.I.]
Open my eyes, see the sunrise
Talkin about memories of G's got my tongue tied
Put out some Henn for my friend, why the good die?
But til the end, I'm in the wind where the slug fly
Pray for my sins, I hope I find Heaven close to me
Try to be godly but these haters provokin me
Pull the shotty want them dead is what my heart say
My hard head make me learn shit the hard way
Dodging the fedz ain't the easy way to live, care
But nigga do it everyday to make a meal stack
Your phone tapped, under surveillance, secretly indicted
Being watched daily, livin shady just to drive a Merdede
And fucking ladies, who making babies used against you
Your enemy be the main nigga you be a friend too
How can begin to explain the pain
Can you stay in the rain
Used to be a simple thing, but the game done changed
Now slanging caine is a lifestyle
Risking your freedom just to ball for a short while
Gettin buckwild on the street up on Westside
Downtown Atlanta, while we ride some of the best die
From cocking hammers of these Tec-9s and .45s
Excuse my grammar; but it's fucked up how time fly
It seem like yesterday we play until our days was nights
And yesterday, I just put flowers at his gravesite and that ain't right

[Outro: Kalage]
All I know
Is I'd been down this road before
This ain't the first time, won't be the last
I gotta slow down cause I'm living too fast
It's time to admit I need some help
Still living with my momma, can't feed myself
Life ain't about who straight, who real, who fake, and who gay
It's about who pray(Common)
In the Spirit of God
In the Spirit of the Ancestors
In the Spirit of the Black Panthers
In the Spirit of Assata Shakur
We make this movement towards freedom
For all those who have been oppressed, and all those in the struggle
Yeah. yo, check it-

[Common Verse 1]
There were lights and sirens, gunshots firing
Cover your eyes as I describe a scene so violent
Seemed like a bad dream, she laid in a blood puddle
Blood bubbled in her chest, cold air brushed against open flesh
No room to rest, pain consumed each breath
Shot twice with her hands up
Police questioned but shot before she answered
One Panther lost his life, the other ran for his
Scandalous the police were as they kicked and beat her
Comprehension she was beyond, tryna hold on
To life. She thought she'd live with no arm
That's what it felt like, got to the hospital, eyes held tight
They moved her room to room-she could tell by the light
Handcuffed tight to the bed, through her skin it bit
Put guns to her head, every word she got hit
"Who shot the trooper?" they asked her
Put mace in her eyes, threatened to blast her
Her mind raced till things got still
Opened her eyes, realized she's next to her best friend who got killed
She got chills, they told her: that's where she would be next
Hurt mixed wit anger-survival was a reflex
They lied and denied visits from her lawyer
But she was building as they tried to destroy her
If it wasn't for this German nurse they would've served her worse
I read this sister's story, knew that it deserved a verse
I wonder what would happen if that would've been me?
All this shit so we could be free, so dig it, y'all

[Hook: Cee-Lo vocals]
I'm thinkin' of Assata, yes
Listen to my Love, Assata, yes
Your Power and Pride is beautiful
May God bless your Soul

(Common Verse 2)
It seemed like the middle of the night when the law awakened her
Walkie-talkies crackling, I see 'em when they taking her
Though she kind of knew
What made the ride peaceful was the trees and the sky was blue
Arrived to Middlesex Prison about six in the morning
Uneasy as they pushed her to the second floor in
A cell, one cot, no window, facing hell
Put in the basement of a prison with all males
And the smell of misery, seatless toilets and centipedes
She'd exercise, paint, and begin to read
Two years inna hole. Her soul grew weak
Away from people so long she forgot how to speak
She discovered freedom is a unspoken sound
And a wall is a wall and can be broken down
Found peace in the Panthers she went on trial with
One of the brothers she had a child with
The foulness they would feed her, hopin she's lose her seed
Held tight, knowing the fight would live through this seed
In need of a doctor, from her stomach she's bleed
Out of this situation a girl was conceived
Separated from her, left to mother the Revolution
And lactated to attack hate
Cause federal and state was built for a Black fate
Her emptiness was filled with beatings and court dates
They fabricated cases, hoping one would stick
And said she robbed places that didn't exist
In the midst of threats on her life and being caged with Aryan whites
Through dark halls of hate she carried the light
I wonder what would happen if that would've been me?
All of this shit so we could be free
Yeah, I often wonder what would happen if that would've been me?
All of this shit so we could be free, so dig it, people-

[Hook]

(Common Verse 3)
Yo
From North Carolina her grandmother would bring
News that she had had a dream
Her dreams always meant what they needed them to mean
What made them real was the action in between
She dreamt that Assata was free in they old house in Queens
The fact that they always came true was the thing
Assata had been convicted of a murder she couldn't of done
Medical evidence shown she couldn't of shot the gun
It's time for her to see the sun from the other side
Time for her daughter to be by her mother's side
Time for this Beautiful Woman to become soft again
Time for her to breathe, and not be told how or when
She untangled the chains and escaped the pain
How she broke out of prison I could never explain
And even to this day they try to get to her
But she's free with political asylum in Cuba

[Hook]

(Assata)
Freedom! You askin me about freedom. Askin me about freedom?
I'll be honest with you. I know a whole more about what freedom isn't
Than about what it is, cause I've never been free
I can only share my vision with you of the future, about what freedom is
Uhh, the way I see it, freedom is-- is the right to grow, is the right to
Blossom
Freedom is -is the right to be yourself, to be who you are
To be who you wanna be, to do what you wanna do. (fade out)[Intro: Eased]
This is Seeed ya
Everybody wake up
Forget your strife
Embrace life
And check this:

[Verse 1: Enuff]
Jau, die Nacht ist vorbei, die bösen Geister sind weg
Ich kipp' dich aus'm Bett und mach Kaffee der tote Tanten weckt
Sind schön angezeckt, löschen unser'n Brand mit Sekt
Und fahr'n an Strand - das Leben fiebert
Wir haben uns angesteckt
Gestern war's so kalt, heute ist es heiß
Sonne macht geil und weil das so ist
Scheint sie heute zum Beweis
Das Radio klingt feist
Gestern war in den Top 10 Scheiß
Heute ist die Liste heiß
Und du tanzt, dass ich Gott für deine Kiste preis'

[Hook: Ear]
Baby wach auf, ich zähl' bis zehn
Das Leben will einen ausgeben und das will ich sehen
Lass uns endlich rausgehen, das Radio aufdrehen
Das wird unser Tag, Baby, wenn wir aufstehn

[Verse 2: Eased]
Steh auf jetzt oder nie, Girl
Zu viel geschlafen und das Leben ist halb vorbei
Ich steh drauf wie du tanzt zu dem Lied
Wir holen uns zurück was irgendwann auf der Strecke blieb
(I'm sad) I want to see your funny side again
(Make me laugh and) Take me to your heart where it all began
(Make a new start) I promise I'll do all I can
For this is the very last chance
To let our love light shine again

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Cee Lo Green]
Wake up woman
There's something that I want you to see
A brand new you and me
They're just waiting to be
Here's my hand
So meet me half of the way
Sweetheart, we're sharing this day
And I dont wish to stay
The way that I am
I see the circumstances are strange
How I want you to change
But still stay the same
The less that we talk
The more time we try
And while you were sleeping
Time passed by

[Hook: Ear]
Oh Baby, lass uns gehen
Das Leben will einen ausgeben und das will ich sehen
Lass uns endlich aufstehn, das Radio aufdrehen
Dazu werden wir tanzen und das wird gut aussehen

[Hook][Intro: Cee-Lo]
I gotta be by myself
Gotta be by myself this time

[Verse 1: Asher Roth]
In the backseat screaming out loud
In the backseat screaming out
Ash is young, attractive, handsome bachelor, awesome rapper
Got a knack for vernacular when I perform spectacular
I'll have any girl that I want
I'mma take the girl in the front
Boobs bounce when I tell the crowd jump
Honey, come backstage I just want to have fun
But I'm too young to be locked down, not now
Need a new car, drive around with the top down
New broad with her bra and her top down
Chillin' in the backseat screaming out loud

[Refrain: Cee-Lo]
She wants to be my lady but I don't see her
She wants to be my lady but I'm a free bird
I gotta be by myself, gotta be by myself this time
I gotta fly by myself, go get high by myself this time

[Verse 2: Asher Roth]
The cycle is Shawn Michaels, heartbreak
And yeah, I like you but not enough to wife you
Say I'm nice, true and you think I'm the right dude
But there's another girl just like you, like who
I'm on the road, another night, another show
New event in a new time zone
And the live show is so mind blowing
And it's my show so you know that I'm blown, you know
No text gonna give me head
Long distance just ain't my thing
Yeah I'm single, don't need no ring
I'm a free man now, I don't need no strings, sing

[Refrain]

[Verse 3: Asher Roth]
If you're cool with nights at the pool
Jacuzzis and groupies, groupies and booze
And no rules, I'm only twenty two
I need to watch football and hang with the crew
But if you don't get mad when I get fat
Cause all I do is eat, drink, smoke weed and rap
And play Madden then dag
You're pretty rad and I take it all back, c'mon

[Hook]

Just keep clapping your hands
Feels good, feels nice and warm in here right now
I'm feeling free, if you feel free
Clap your hands, ah, ah, ah, c'mon

[Refrain][Hook: Cee-Lo]
His name's, DOOM
They wonder just who is he
But don't worry
Believe me he'll get busy
When it comes to
Poetry he's got plenty
La la lah... la la la la lah

[Verse 1: MF Doom]
Jump 'em in like jump rope, double dutch
Then turn on the mic with a thumb stroke, subtle touch
Cuddle clutch, is this thing on?
Like the fling with Mrs. King Kong, this spring gone?
Sing a song of slaphappy crappiness
He came to blow like it was strapped to his nappy chest
Surely I jest, the best on a wireless mic
Not an eye test, yet I di-gress
But why stress? Try and remember when
Maybe bit the tender skin-ned babysitter Gwendolyn
The type to hit and run and go tell a friend
Word to El Muerto cucaracha exoskeleton
He know, flow like interstellar wind
Tow a rap djinn by his toe into hell again
{*ahem*} One two, check me too
Loose wreck see through your goose-neck EQ

[Hook]

[Verse 2: MF Doom]
Ay! If I may interject
Rap these days is like a pain up in the neck
Cornier and phonier than a play fight
Take two of these and don't phone me on the late night
The beat won't fail me
With more rhymes than times he washed his hands and feet daily
And all that kerosene ain't cheap
Villain been deep since a teenage creep
Peep - he always was a gentleman
And kept the pen and a pencil in his mental den
Right there next to where the Rolodex was
Before it turned up all burnt by his solar plexus
He don't know his own strength
When he's on the bone it's like the microphone's length
And width, ain't it funky like dingy socks?
Feel the full effect off cassette in your Benzie Box

[Hook][Verse 1]
She rested her head upon my chest
Sensed liberation in between breaths
Wonder if sex is what she found it in
Peace, found it laying down with men
Wasn't there to judge her, many ways I loved her
It was more than bodies we shared with each other
We layed under the cover of friends
A place where many lovers began
I began, to feel her body shake in my hand
Body language, it's so hard trying to understand
Usually after sex, it's a good feel
Took by silence, emotion stood still
I could feel, her tears spill from her grille
Hurt from before that began to build
She told me hold me, a story she assembled it
Tellin' it, trying not to remember it
It was a story of innocence taken
Thought she could redeem, through love makin'
When she was eight she was raped by her father
And tried to escape through multiple sex partners
Felt pitiful, she had only learned
To love through the physical, inside it burned
My heart turned, I thought of what this man did
She forgave him, she grew to understand it
Her soul was tired and never really rested
Only with men through aggression
Said it was a blessing and it happened for a reason
By speaking it, she found freedom between me and you

[Hook: Cee-Lo]
Sometimes I wish a, careless whisper
Serenade her, without speaking a word
Because of you I'm stronger, I'm afraid no longer
I feel so alive in me, you have liberated me

[Verse 2]
She laid, I watched her breathe
Happy to be here, not afraid to leave
I couldn't concieve her not being here
Death in her face her not having fear
Less than a year she was diagnosed with it
Memories of that year, so close and vivid
Happiness, would only visit, once in a while
To watch an adult, becoming a child
Somehow, I knew she'd make it
The life of one so given early would God take it?
Hurt she placed in, hope and prayer
Hurt she placed in chemo and lost hair
I stare with my eyes closed
Wonder when the body leave does the mind go
Watchin' Jordan became less important
Seeing this disease eat away my aunt's organs
According to doctors theres no cure
We went through doubt, and cases of insure
Wish I knew then how to heal with herbs
Knew a part of her I could heal with words
But the creator was sending for her
What seemed like the end was the beginning for her
Like that, she didn't want us to remember her
No more medication did she want us to give to her
It spread from her liver to her lungs to her last breath
Only to be freed through death between me and you

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
He spoke with his eyes, tear-filled
A lump in his throat, his fear built
My whole life it was in steel
This ain't the way that men feel
A feeling, he said he wish he could kill
A feeling, not even time could heal
This is how real life's supposed to be?
For it to happen to someone close to me?
So far we'd come, for him to tell me
As he did, insecurity held me
I felt like he failed me
To the spirit, yelled help me
I'd known him for like what seemed forever
About going pro we dreamed together
Never knew it would turn out like this
For so long he tried to fight this
Now there was no way for him to ignore it
His parents found out and hated him for it
How could I judge him? Had to accept him if I truly loved him
No longer he said had he hated himself
Through sexuality he liberated himself between me and you

[Hook]

Liberation, peaceMm hmm
Ok, Ok
Yeah
Y'all thought I lost it

[Verse One: Cee-Lo]
In no fashion have I lost my passion for the pen
It's just that lately life has been a lost less inspirin
To tell you the truth trials and tribulations is very tirin
I gotta play a little game of gimmick and gunfirin
I'm not aspirin to be any lower or higher than
I get equal as in eye to eye again
I'm the truth, I'm complicated I'm all ready but try again
I've got to die once to never ever die again
And what I believe within I engrave within my skin
And one thang that I ain't is a saint without a sin
How could there be a now if there never was a then?
That is unbalanced just like the yang without the yen
I am distinguishably deeper as opposed to the paper-thin
And I breathe oxygen, and you rhymin bout rocks again
You stagnant, standing still enough to feel the world spin
I'm beginning to smell the end in the path of the blowing wind
Hopefully I'm fortunate enough to spend forever with a friend
I'm slow dancing with destiny every day until then
When I first got my big break I said that I would never bend
And discredit my character to keep up or contend
And my belief beat baseline secrete such a special blend
I am not like them at all and I cannot pretend
I am not like you at all and I cannot pretend

[Hook]
DAMN
That shit was funky
You heard that nigga?

DAMN
Shawty Lo
(yup, c'mon)

[Verse Two: Cee-Lo]
I get off on an extension or compare comprehension
I'm in a classroom of my own, I'm too far gone for competition
Yet I'm never obnoxious with my obvious ambition
Perfectly imperfect is my dimension's definition
I engage my pen pierces the page so that it bleeds my intention
With honorable mention of God's divine intervention
I'm incredible I'm inevitable and there's no possible prevention
I'll hardly (have to) scream my dream and I'll have your undivided attention
The powers that be will be beaten into submission
And you will be able to see my revolution on television
You'll get an aneurysm fuckin around with my head on collision
With the power to get you dead and half the dead risen
I remember when my development was arrested
I was doin time on my mind misguided and misdirected
I was sick, so sick if I spoke to you you'd be infected
Then my conscience was cleared of all charges and I came out corrected
Reinvented, refined, replenished and well rested
On a mission for a medium to manifest the thoughts I collected
After that everything I breathed upon, I blessed it
I committed crimes of passion and my soul was suspected
But it was thrown out of court because of course the Creator and I connected
He told me, "fear not for thou art protected. Your life is being requested
And you are being tested, so make every attempt you can to expect the unexpected."

[Hook]

Mm mm mm
Boy that Lo boy

DAMN
Oh Lawd
Cee-Lo why you do it like that?
You ain't have to bustin all like that, man
Makin these lil rappers feel like they can't rap

DAMN
I got some more, I got some more if you want some

[Verse Three: Cee-Lo]
I am internally evolving entirely
Extensive eclectic expression eloquently
Instantly innovative, Courageously creative
I'm driven, this God given gift it comes naturally to the native
Not a need for the dramatics or the systematic
Simplicities, strictly science and mathematics
The mastermind of the mighty mystical and magical moves
And metaphors manifests masterpieces
Thoroughly fury through the inner mind's eye establishes this syn-thesis
Of these innermost, insightful, intriguing interpretations of extreme intelligence
My commonsense is no co-incidence
Caution: competitors approach carefully
I'm able to see
Rare ranges of distance, I expect respect
There's no tolerance for negligence, never
You'll forever
Feel the wrath of the pure and powerful poetry, permanently
Pre-meditative, political, critical, compellin, story-tellin
Defining desire, faith fuelin the fire
Brilliance, ?? philosophical, psychological willingly waging warfare
Withstandin, commandin, demandin the listening ears to hear what God's forcin
Instead endorsin education. Equality, not hate
Just revolution of the mind state
Note mere words but emotions
Which is essential, influential provin my people's potential
Militancy, innocence, insight, listen to God then write
Since my birth date I been tight!
Shit

[Hook]

Now I don't want never hear nobody else say
Goddamn a nigga from the South can't rhyme
NEVER!

DAMN
Hehehe...Now can I do my shit??[Cee-Lo]
At times, I, consider myself as this
A seed planted in the midst of distant wilderness
Destiny is already pre-planned for me, the process is slow
But eventually I'll grow to be another tree
The lifecycle continues as I rise toward the sky
Frustrated and dehydrated cause the soil is dry
Polluted hidden's what I'll have to remain, I won't complain
I'll just keep waitin patiently, til he give me some rain, but
Behind shades of gray, this is where the sun hides
I anticipate the warmth, that the light provides
So I don't go and branch out, in the wrong direction
And the Elder Tree offers me wisdom for protection
He said, "You see son, if you can learn from a mistake
How can it be one? And other seeds need examples
So be one; and, there's no way out
Cause only living it can show you what I'm talkin bout"

[Mista]
Woke up Sunday morning
Got a little bad news today
They say my life ain't worth livin
And time is slowly tickin away
Don't think that I'm going crazy
Cause stars they running through my head
I know I gotta be strong, gotta hold on
Sometimes I'd rather give up instead
Seem like I'm better off dead

Chorus: * varies throughout *

Blackberry molasses, one of the things that never change
You've gotta keep pushin on
The sun don't rain all the time
There's gonna be some heartache and pain

[Mista]
Don't tell me how to live my life
After all that we've been through
Don't wanna hear bout your hardship
Cause I've been there myself a time or two
Still life goes on
If you just keep holding on
So many things you'll survive, once you realize
There's no such place as paradise
At least in my eyes

Chorus

..

Chorus (repeat to fade)][Cee-Lo Green]
The wine is white, and the lights are dim
They warned you, don't go home with him
These guilty feet'll never dance again
(I know, but will I ever get the chance again?)
I've been held in contempt for an incident
It takes two to be intimate
So by no means was she innocent
(Well it wasn't a crime, but admit the sin)

[Hook]
They said, that chivalry is dead
Then why is her body (body) in my bed?
At sunrise, the morning papers read
They found a body (body) in my bed (ahhh)

[Cee-Lo Green]
Ahhhh! Can nonchalance be ambiance? Of course
I lean toward her and whisper the choice is yours
Need I remind you that I'll have no remorse
(I understand)
Here's a kiss, sweetheart this won't hurt a bit
I can kid with kindness or murder it
Then I would face the time a murderer would get
(Or get away with it) Life

[Hook]

[Cee-Lo Green]
Yes, ahhhh!
May I?
You're so good looking
Let me touch you
Ohhh {*inhaling*}
You taste so good...
Yeahhhh {*fades out*}[Verse 1 - Cee Lo]
I will build a bridge
Over the troubled water for you
The one that was here
Was weak and weary
Time had worn it down
Started little by little
With your feet right in the middle
We laugh about it later
But it's time for it now
Soon as all the work is done
Both hands in harmony
Sit and talk and share the sun
I know that you can feel it
But it's gonna take a minute

[Hook]
It's gonna get a little easier
Oh, it's gonna get a little easier
A little easier for you to understand

[Verse 2 - Cee Lo]
I want to build the bridges
So that when the elder spirit
It reminds us of that spirit
That makes us all the same
Don't give up on your children
Because of human nature
We've got virtue, we've got vices
What you've done is ?
It don't matter how long it's been
Turn back the music on
I want to dance with my father again
I know that you can feel it
But it's gonna take a minute

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Cee Lo]
I want to build a bridge
Between every sister and brother
Father and mother, friend and lover
Black, white and other love one another
I dare you to just do it
It's the only way to prove it
If I promise to take the first step
Will you take the other?
Don't you want to be certain?
Don't you want to know you're free?
You can come together over me
I know that you can feel it
But it's gonna take a minute

[Hook][Cee-Lo Green]
I've been living for the weekend, but no not any more
Cause here comes that familiar feeling, that Friday's famous for
Yeah I'm lookin for some action, and it's out there somewhere
You can feel the electricity, all in the evening air
And it may just be more of the same
But sometimes you wanna go where everyone knows your name
So I guess I'll have to wait and see
But I'm just gonna let something brand new happen to me

[Hook]
And it's alright (it's alright)
It's alright, it's alright, it's alriiiiiight (it's alright)
Bright lights and the big cityyyyyyy
It belongs to us toniiiiiiiight (tonight, tonight)

[Cee-Lo Green]
Now Friday is cool, but there's something about Saturday night
You can't say what you won't do, cause you know that you just might
I'm alive this evening, it was love at first sight
A-this Saturday, and every Saturday for the rest of my life
And everyone's standing in line, uh
Yeah lookin good, and lookin for a real good time
So I'll never have to wonder if
I'll have someone to share all of this with

[Hook]

[Cee-Lo Green]
Yes I need it, everybody doeeeeeees
Cocktails and conversation, music and making loooooooooove

[Outro]
And it's alright (it's alright)
It's alright, it's alright, it's alriiiiiight (it's alright)
Bright lights and the big cityyyyyyy
It belongs to us toniiiiiiiight (tonight)
Bright lights, bright lights
Bright lights and the big cityyyyyyy (tonight)
It belongs to us toniiiiiiiight (tonight)[Verse 1 - Cee-Lo Green]

I'll have someone to share all of this with

[Hook]
And it's alright
Bright lights and the big city
It belongs to us tonight

[Verse 3 - Wiz Khalifa]
Hear the night life when it's calling
So we drink until we falling
Ain't a Laker but I'm balling
Meet about 3 girls and
I brought these girls to the club
Can I get em all in
Make a movie and let 'em star in it
Get drunk, get her in my car and
Do the same thing in the morning
Hear 'em hatin' but we ignore them
Which one wanna go
Rolling this green, hit one on the low
Champagne, meet broads on the floor
We getting bread so we toast
To the life and the fact that we major
Not to mention we Taylor
Been in the game, player
Who up next like neighbors?[Bridge: Cee-Lo Green]
I can't hold on, I can't hold on
But I just hold on, I just hold on

[Verse 1: Deacon]
Lord why's everybody's puzzle missing pieces
Struggling, grinding, greaseless
No rhyme or reason in sight
I'm seeing the pain off in their eyes
I'm seeing that often we lie, lost in our cries
I'm seeing impatient parents
Blaming unsuspecting children
I'm seeing inpatients critical
Streets are dead from the killings
I'm like damn, blocks hot, not from the ozone
Through camera's cops watch these lil boys hold chrome
Stuck, teenagers, foxes and pups
On blocks rocks in they chucks, choppers watching above
They need love, not snug cuffs, federally fucked
Tis all an orchestration Hans Zimmer couldn't conduct
But whattawedo, most problems dun been discussed
But we talk about actions on the backend, and hush
I guess most of y'all must listen to Rush
Long as you all good, then everybody under you flushed

[Hook: Cee-Lo Green]
Everytime I try and help myself
Reaching out and finding no one else
I can't hold on
So anytime you feel your soul's in need
Realize you can depend on me
And let's just hold on

[Verse 2: Deacon]
We slipping far under the ghoul yard
In grim tombs we some dim stars, batteries full barred
At birth, but it's hard to stay charged on earth
Cause world wide like girth, the wise are in dirt
Grandmama's used to bus us to church
Humming Hymns
Stretch out a fat meal on the table from something slim
Now we starving, faith on the back of a carton
To find it, follow tracks down arms
And boulevards in the south, park
Watch as mouth art paints audio visuals
Call it rythmical miracles
And parts what your eyes red see
Throwing change ups in your medley through headpiece
Still Judge, but dont Dredd each day, instead feast
Life's an unfed beast that eats bread and meat
That's either your cash or your corpse
So I just hope that the Lord helps me last through these wars
Ya know?

[Hook]

[Bridge][Cee-Lo]
Come on
Chop chop
Mmm hmm
Yeah man
I'm just gonna play with y'all on this
Hidey ho

Well hello, howdy do, how are you, that's good
Who me, still hot, I still got, you got me nigga
I'm here, I'm there, cause I'm wrong, cause I'm right
I can spit on anything, got plenty game, authentic
My pen's sick, forensic, defends it, he wins it
Again and a, again and a, again and a, again and a
I'm the one, come see, lookey I, and come meet
The young Cee, the one treats everything the sun seek
I'm hollering, can't help, I'm hungry
I cake rap, bake rap, sack rap, trap rap
Same shoes, same shirt, the same work, the same jerk
Claim hurt, the game hurt, my name work, it ain't work
I'm fast, time fast, I'm first, I'm last
Psychic, I knew you would like it, like this
I write this, priceless, more then my right wrist
Cock back, block track, the beat bleed, speak read
Men eat weed, bead seed, I speed read, you need me
To give it to you like you want it, I own it when I'm on it
Maintain the same thing, nigga rap about the same game
None left, shame shame, plain game, insaine
When I rap things change, me and God, same thing
Money's here, money fold, I'm young, money old
Maybe look, cross hanging down to my tummy toes
I know it, I'm a stop, I'm trying just like life

Yes I can sing, and I can rap
And I can act, and I can dance
And I can dress, sign of the best
So is my guest, man I'm impressed
Hurry hurry hurry hurry, come and see
This is just like child's play to me, ah ha
Little melody and a little drum
All I really need to have a little fun
Hush little one, let's get it done
Dress like a bum, bust like a gun
Hurry hurry hurry hurry, come and see
This is just like child's play to me, ah ha

[Ludacris]
Who the only little nigga that you know with bout fifty flows
Do about fifty shows in a week but creep on the track with my tippy toes
Shhh, shut the fuck up, I'm trying to work
Ah forget it, I'm going berzerk
Cause I stack my change, and I'm back to claim
My reign on top, so pack your thangs
I rack your brain like crack cocaine
My fame won't stop or I'll jack your chain
Give it up, ding ding ding, thanks, the price was right
That gray goose got me loose, but my eyes are tight
It's the truth, give me a light like I'm dynamite
Alright, alright, we goin ride tonight
I'm so dangerous that I gotta bang with this
You could be famous or remain nameless
Better just drop down to your knees, call upon the lord and pray
Better luck next time, cause you wanna open that door today
Your hair sorta gray, it's that sorta day
Flowing so hard over this track and I got more to say
I ain't new to this, I'm so true to this
See what you get fucking with Cee-Lo and Ludacris

[Cee-Lo]
Yes I can sing, and I can rap
And I can act, and I can dance
And I can dress, sign of the best
So is my guest, man I'm impressed
Hurry hurry hurry hurry, come and see
This is just like child's play to me, ah ha
Little melody and a little drum
All I really need to have a little fun
Hush little one, let's get it done
Dress like a bum, bust like a gun
Hurry hurry hurry hurry, come and see
This is just like child's play to me, ah ha
Yes I can sing, and I can rap

Haha
Okay, there you have it little kids
Wasn't that fun?
Yeah
Saturday morning, Cee-Lo Green and my man Ludacris
Doing this thing, ATL style
This is childs play
Seriously though
I can rap bout any you guys with my tongue tied
Ha ha ha
Don't make me get serious on your ass
You wouldn't like me when I'm serious
I could have said anything I want to[Cee-Lo Green]
Yeah, let me hold you
Don't cry baby

If this makes you cry-yyyy
Girl I didn't mean it
Next time I should lie-ieee
The truth is inconvenient
I bet if you try-yyyy
You could live without me
I really don't know why-hyyy
You bother to cry about me

[Hook]
Cry, cry baby
I guess that I'm the bad guy now
Cry, cry baby
And just like all the other ones
Cry, cry baby, ohhh

[Cee-Lo Green]
I hate to see you cry-yyyy
Sad to say I've seen it
We should say goodbye-yyyy
And this time really mean it
When some time goes byyyy
I'm sure that you'll feel better
But if she needs to cry-yyyy
Then maybe I should let her

[Hook]

[Cee-Lo Green]
Now, help me find a way, yeah
What more, can I, sayyyyy?
To youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu

[Hook Final]
Cry, cry baby
I guess that I'm the bad guy now
Cry, cry baby
And just like all the other ones
Cry, cry baby
Build a wall around your heart
Cry, cry baby
Bay-bayyyyyyy

[Outro]
Ohhh, ohhh, OHHHHHH (just like all the other ones)
Oh-ohh, ohh, OHHHHHH (just like all the other ones)
Cryyy baby, cryyy baby - ow, ow, ow
Whenever she cry baby, cryyy babyyyy
Ah-ohhhh!
Don't cry baby...[Hook]
See there's no way and there's no how
That I could stop now
I'mma die tryin', I'mma die trying
And sometimes I get weak from walking the road I'm on
But I'mma keep on. I'mma die tryin', I'mma die tryin' (MMMMMM)

Before we came being southern wasn't something to claim
That flag wasn't something to fly it was something to blame
Smilin' and shuckin' and jivin' I was so ashamed
They did us dirty, apparently an appropriate name
I wrote about a revolution and sung from the soul
Spoke with my spirit and mind, my ambition was blind
Answering the call of God like a child obeying
Preaching the very same proverbs they killed Martin for saying
But you can't break the mold in by holding your breath
Thought if I died for you, that would be an honorable death
So sincere my eyes begin to swell up and tear
And it's clear, my music may not do well up in here
Oh my god being a nigger must be a good payin job
With all the fringe benefits, ignorance is bliss
There is a time and a place for everybody's taste
But I know too much and I owe too much

[Hook]

So here it is, an invitation to an open book
A painful past, my heart is still broken look
I know you don't hate me, just not assured that anyone appreciate me
See I've been having a hard time selling my albums lately
In recent news The Source couldn't find any microphones to rate me
Using words like "extreme" and "alternative" to equate me
Which is true I'm in a box with a view but you still wanna gate me?
I could be a pretty good thug but it wouldn't compare to a great me
The final cross to bear, this mine, it's not a cross to share
But isn't it ironic I still went and bought a cross to wear
That obviously cost to wear
But considerably less than the price that it costs to care
And I don't have another loss to spare, how dare them say that I can't win
Even though I know talking intelligent just ain't in
You most likely to go broke when you just can't bend
So me and JJ both gon' have to paint then

[Hook]

Listen
People +Still Standing+ in line at the +World Party+ for some +Soul Food+
To get put back in that old mood
They say we like the new 'Lo
And we respect everything you trying to do 'Lo
Do what you do but just do more that you know
It's a catch 22 and I couldn't cry
And I'm under oath with them both and I couldn't lie
Custom said that I'm too dope and I coudln't fly
And you getting rich talkin shit so why shouldn't I?
I'm just playing but I guess that couldn't go without saying
I'm just gon ride this evolution until it stop me where I'm staying
But I ain't gonna have to lie to ya to make it sound fly to ya
I keep my feet on the ground and bring the sky to ya

Doctor
Won't you come and help me take this pain away?
Oh, oh, oh doctor
Give me what I need to get me through the day
I want that feel good
That feel good
That real good, yeah
I want that feel good
That feel good
That real good Dr. Feel Good, help me

(Verse 1)
Lately I been beside myself
It and it's unlike me to hide myself
It's not like I like being by myself I wanna see the world but can't decide myself
Whether or not to get up off this couch
Whether or not to get about this house I wanna know what it's like to feel real good
Is there something you can prescribe, Dr. Feel Good?
I mean he's so happy, she's so free Doctor, what in the world is wrong with me?
I just need some reassurance I know my carrier won't be insuring this
If you could just be earnest
Oops, I meant honest and make this promise
If any of this makes sense let 'em know I wasn't crazy, just thoroughly convinced

(Hook)
Doctor
Won't you come and help me take this pain away?
Oh, oh, oh doctor
Give me what I need to get me through the day
I want that feel good
That feel good
That real good, yeah
I want that feel good
That feel good
That real good Dr. Feel Good, help me

She got the set of lips like a sedative
Every time I kiss, it's like medicine
Something said to me no, no, don't let her in
Cause every time I do, I end up upset again
And then it's back to the waiting room
Waiting patiently for them to bring another patient to 'em
Anything is possible
Especially when you see it in the hospital
I hope Dr. Feel Good can fix me
And help me find peace of mind before 50
(Mr. McCoy, you're up next)
I made a detour quickly hightailed it towards the exit door before they could get me
It didn't take much to lose 'em
But before I got home, I came to a conclusion
That feeling good means another appointment take two of these and don't expect a call in the morning

Doctor
Won't you come and help me take this pain away?
Oh, oh, oh doctor
Give me what I need to get me through the day
I want that feel good
That feel good
That real good, yeah
I want that feel good
That feel good
That real good Dr. Feel Good, help me

(Bridge)
Ladies and Gentlemen, hey, pardon me, patients
See what I'mma do right now is break it down
Put your hands together
Repeat after me, come on
I feel good (I feel good)
Real good (Real good)
I feel good (I feel good)
Real good (Real good)

Doctor
Won't you come and help me take this pain away?
Oh, oh, oh doctor
Give me what I need to get me through the day
I want that feel good
That feel good
That real good, yeah
I want that feel good
That feel good
That real good Dr. Feel Good, help me

(Outro)
Yeah, I'll let this one ride out
Yeah, brought to you by yours truly Mr. Cee Lo Green
The delectable Smeezingtons
Thank y'all for comin' out
God bless Good night Travie, by the away
