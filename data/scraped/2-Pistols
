Magician with the work call it dope boy magic

Blue, white, yellow, black
Pink diamonds (You already know)
That my favorite line
If your shit shined like mine
You'd say it everytime

[Hook X2]

Frostbit neck, and my wrist froze
You can see my damn watch with your eyes closed
Blue, white, yellow, black, pink diamonds
Shawty shinnin, still grindin

[Verse 2 Young Jeezy]
I know they watchin'
I pose for the photograph
Those indictment papers
Hope you want my autograph
We don't trip, we just live life
Trying to dodge them handcuffs
And them blue lights
Frostbit neck and my wrist froze
You can see my damn watch with your eyes closed
Ask them hoes, with the extra blow
The nigga with the louie luggage down in Mexico
In a A-town fitted cap
I'm so hot tower
I think I need a thermostat
Give a fuck about a player hater
Hit him with the tool, flush his whole radiator
[Hook X2]

[Verse 3 2 Pistols]

I'm 24,with 24 figures
24 triggers, 24 inches
But I keep 'em clean
So they pass for sixes
Stunnin' on you pussy ass niggas
72' dope rally straight shoot pass you in it
Flat screens
, 18's, I don't hear shit
Pocket full of stones
I got 'em beatin' strong threw my speakers bitch
Young boss shit
Oh you didn't hear 4th generation
My grand daddy used to sell birds
Who am I to fuck tradition up
I got my ass in the kitchen
Water whip me bently chip
200k off my block bitch
I know you thinkin' rap
I'm thinkin' laundry mat
Clean money homie

[Hook X2][Hook]
If it ain't money, money you talking 'bout
Look boy, you can talk your ass off
If it ain't pussy, pussy you talking 'bout
Shawty, you can get the fucking walk

[Verse 1: 2 Pistols]
Just vibing to myself man
Swisher sweet full blowing on that great dane
Big dog shit, your bitch call me Max Payne
2 pistols, get it
Anyway, I just landed on the west for a few days
I'm on that bubble 5 roof gone switching lanes
My California peach, she likes to role-play
Lights camera action, do your thang
And when she do it, do it, do it
I can't complain, pussy ass mouth, that's a triple play
You a nasty nigga, that's what them hoes say
I reply one thing (I don't care)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Left the supermarket, took the coup and parked it
You can catch me frequently at Gucci shoe department
I tell them get me peas on all colors
And ain't shit changed, these all honors
True to my religion, promethazine my prescription
I look in the mirror, that's my competition
Then I talk to myself, myself said, "What?"
I said "You a ill nigga, roll a blunt up,"
I do it for my hood, south side, A-town
All my dogs moving like Grey Hounds we pays for
Great car with black wheels, it's looking like a skateboard
I've been getting money since day one, uh!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2 Pistols]
I'm bout nothing but them Benjamins
26 inches looking like some ceiling fans
(Chop! chop!) Down the block candy apple red
With my ruger that will shoot you like Simon said
This ... it's a blessing, I coulda gone fed
... but a man cause...
Just ask about me, you coulda got them packets off me
Too many snitches in the street, so I'm rapping sorry
New Ferrari, stick leather bitch
You pussy niggas funny, Eddie Griffin shit
I'm with my white chick, nah she ain't super thick
Just call her Abby Wambach, her head game full attack

[Hook][Hook; Joell Ortiz]
Woho, all I know is fast money and homicide
I see no way so I grind
Tell me what you would do if your life was just like mine
You would have found another way
But yeah you say we aren’t the same, but why, why?

[Verse 1: 2 Pistols]
Started at the bottom, no I ain’t got no worries
Gucci, Findi, Prada, that’s all my bitch wearing
I’m industry, you in the street, ain’t no comparing
My rolex got your bitch wet cause she keep on staring
I’m swagging on these bitches, stunting on these niggas
For all of part time, I’m pouring out the liquor
My brother locked down, and I can’t go visit
Convicted, felon, so al I can do is sent pictures
Hit the club and ball, me and my girls is dolls
We do it for real no fake instagram pics niggas like y’all
White diamonds no flaw, Lamborghini, no top
I’m riding with a, china doll, and she ain’t on no draws

[Hook]

[Verse 2: 2 Pistols]
You just gonna sit there and lie, act like this tough guy
Knowing you apple crumb pie, sat in the window cool
And you headshots to see us run by
Say mama they all get shooting, when I was at war, yet such a young guy
Too young to even be boozing, but every night I held my cup high
And slung the everything move
I was just like design my projects, get inside that letter box
Head inside that staircase, crack inside them yellow tops
The cops inside our bizness, sometimes they chilled and let us rock
Sometimes they on that picture, running through mud to try to get us knocked
What do you know about gemstar, sitting the slice in the dice
Weighting up shit then wipe, and all of the crumbs from all that triton
Going outside and risking everything, they coming upstairs and writing
I survived from luck of god, or maybe I’m lucky god just likely

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2 Pistols]
I came from the colder, long marijuana
Platinum plaques off this rap shit, and now I’m shitting commas
Death before the sona, middle finger to your honor
Only god can judge me, head first in these streets
Body bag d peets, it’s blood money, your bitch was sliding in the new v
Shawty where does the fish? Told her call me 2 piece
She smiled and blew me a kiss
I’m balling bitch I’m balling, turn the lights off to see my wrist
Young boss in the city, my heart cold, no feelings
My money running like emmy, my money running like fog
My money running Chris Johnson, or something like Frank Gal
100 birds, 100 words, either way, I sell dope

[Verse 4: French Montana]
Mad Max, niggas on the bad batch
Montana coke boys know we got the Anthrax
Coup white, shawty mean, long hair, ass fat
Dope boys, coke boys, hottest out
Put that on your last stat
Every shot clear block, that’s fact
Hit it then I slit it then I pass that
Fly and take cab back, balling new Ferrari with the glass back
Everything you fighting for, we had that
2 shots, fast nap
Shots are like my youthem, 2 doors, coup them
Bad bitches loot them, talk birds, we move them
Get the purp I’m used to, get the smoke I’m cali
Coke boys we styling, bad bitches smiling

[Hook](Intro, 2 Pistols)
Yeahhh
Young boss of the city nigga
BMU, Deck, C-bo, J-Flame, Young Ski

(verse 1, Deck)

I just flow to buddy suckers and my nickname UFO
I got a super-duper flow
Arms shootin for the sky
Steady chokin on that killa
I just murdered Micheal Myers
Ridin past the city lights
I maneuver through the night
Movin colors, I got green and I got purp (M.U. got white)
BMU bitch, get it right
You got nothin, but you da pain
All attention for you lames
I got money on my brain
Flashin in lanes
Sit so high bitch, they compare me to a crane
Dump so wet, got off and jumpin out the paint
Come ride with me dawg, you better buy a skuba tank
The chrome is so strong
The paint is on all shine
If it creep through them clouds, them niggas gon' be blind
All I need is UV rays to put them hoes in a daze
Flippin different flavors, bitch can just calls me Lay's
C-bo dawg, aye!

(Hook)

(Verse 2, 2 Pistols)
I pull up to the light, you know I'm ridin old school

Who me? I'm just that nigga
She wanna ride with the boss cause my rims is bigger (Oh yeah)
If I don't look down, I won't even see you niggas (Where they at?)

With her two friends, and they participating
Yeah that's just the life I live
Young boss of the city baby, it is what it is

(Hook)

(Verse 3, J-Flame & Young Ski)
Jizzy!

Aye Khaled, I'm so hood (Hood)
I shoulda been on "I'm So Hood"
Wiggle in the shop, I grip the Oak wood
Twenty-six inches on I-O, what's good?
I'm the man, understand?
Death before dishonor, that's the plan

(Young Ski)
I'm so fly bitch, I think I grow feathers
My cliques mob out, call us the "Blues Brothers"
I'm sittin real high, them haters might stare
I Freddy Crougar'd the whip, to give 'em nightmares
Pull up in somethin fly, oh that was light-year
I spit a little game, cover your wife's ears
I'm lookin down on her, call my whip papsmear
Then they come out of this world, like William Shat-neer

[Hook](Intro, 2 Pistols)
Yeahhh
Young boss of the city nigga
BMU, Deck, C-bo, J-Flame, Young Ski

(Hook)
I got the Chevy sittin right
Rims shinin bright (Bitch I'm-Bitch I'm super fly)
When I pull up to that light
I'm lookin down on 'em (Eyyy eyyy)
I'm lookin down on 'em (Wet-wet paint drippin)
Off the side
Every time I ride
I be ridin through the city, choppin like I'm Micheal Myers
I'm lookin down on 'em (Eyyy eyyy)
I'm lookin down on 'em (Eyyy eyyy)

(verse 1, Deck)
I just lit a blunt of 'dro
Where da bottle? I don't know
I just flow to buddy suckers and my nickname UFO
I got a super-duper flow
Arms shootin for the sky
Steady chokin on that killa
I just murdered Micheal Myers
Ridin past the city lights
I maneuver through the night
Movin colors, I got green and I got purp (M.U. got white)
BMU bitch, get it right
You got nothin, but you da pain
All attention for you lames
I got money on my brain
Flashin in lanes
Sit so high bitch, they compare me to a crane
Dump so wet, got off and jumpin out the paint
Come ride with me dawg, you better buy a skuba tank
The chrome is so strong
The paint is on all shine
If it creep through them clouds, them niggas gon' be blind
All I need is UV rays to put them hoes in a daze
Flippin different flavors, bitch can just calls me Lay's
C-bo dawg, aye!

(Hook)

(Verse 2, 2 Pistols)
I pull up to the light, you know I'm ridin old school
The main four's lookin down, nigga where ya ruler? (So high)
Twenty-eight inch deep-dish (Yes)
Orange candy paint, baby call it Sunkist (Young boss)
Who me? I'm just that nigga
She wanna ride with the boss cause my rims is bigger (Oh yeah)
If I don't look down, I won't even see you niggas (Where they at?)
I don't even see you niggas
I'm with a bad bitch fornicating
With her two friends, and they participating
Yeah that's just the life I live
Young boss of the city baby, it is what it is

(Hook)

(Verse 3, J-Flame & Young Ski)
Jizzy!
I'm gettin money so, that's the word man
I was fly with the white like Birdman (brdrdrdrdr)
Aye Khaled, I'm so hood (Hood)
I shoulda been on "I'm So Hood"
Wiggle in the shop, I grip the Oak wood
Twenty-six inches on I-O, what's good?
I'm the man, understand?
Death before dishonor, that's the plan

(Young Ski)
I'm so fly bitch, I think I grow feathers
My cliques mob out, call us the "Blues Brothers"
I'm sittin real high, them haters might stare
I Freddy Crougar'd the whip, to give 'em nightmares
Pull up in somethin fly, oh that was light-year
I spit a little game, cover your wife's ears
I'm lookin down on her, call my whip papsmear
Then they come out of this world, like William Shat-neer

(Hook)
