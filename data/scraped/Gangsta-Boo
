[Verse 1: Killer Mike]
Reminiscin-in' on our time of innocence
When we drank that Hennessy, ate on lamb and venison
Face fucked you in your kitchenette, fucked you like we tusslin'
Do you fuck your husb-al-and? Like, do y'all be tusslin'?
Do you wear the muzzlin'? Do you ask him pretty please?
Do you crawl on hands and knees, like you used to do for me
Oh, you such a dirty girl, the world won't let you be yourself
I won't accept nothing else, I be having none of that
You be takin' all of this, pleasure come from punishment
Your threshold astonishin', I think I'm in love again
Found my perfect drug again, feel better than heroin
You love my alpha arrogance, 2 Live Crew the narrative
And there it is

[Hook: Killer Mike & Gangsta Boo]
I put that dick in her mouth all day
She got that (dick in her mouth all day)
She take that (dick in her mouth all day)
(She said she wanted my, wanted my)
Dick in her mouth all day, day
I give her that (dick in her mouth all day)
She play with that (dick in her mouth all day)
She want that (dick in her mouth all day)
I think I'm in love again (Love again)

[Verse 2: El-P]
Here I am, my love
Just like when we first hooked up
Feeling like I'm animal
Feeling like you're edible
Bendable
I been away
I don't have too much to say
You say say it anyway
I say take your shit off I'm not playing bae
You little freak
What you are is so unique
Smart and full of filth and joy
You been with some little boys
Now you're with a grown-up man
One who'll actually understands
Kid gloves are not on my hands
I will never condescend
Now spread yourself
She smiled a bit
Gripped the outline of my shit
Oh, my god, I love this chick
I must put my tongue in this
Into every space I go
Give me everything you am
She said, "No, you gimme first"
That was like a day ago
8 AM
She still got my

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Gangsta Boo]
That's what you want huh?
Well let me tell you a little story
I had a young player from the hood
Lick my pussy real good
Kept me stuck with lots of wood
Kept my bank account on swoll
Sniffed my pussy like a rose, smokin' on dro
Made a porn tape, that nigga is a pro, you ain't know?
He had a lot of bad bitches in his past
But I was the one who turned that boy into a motherfuckin' man
His tongue is bomb
And he love for me to ride his face
Front to back, grippin' ass
Pay my bills, where I live, fuck me good
Broke ass niggas killing me
I'm about my money, ho
Never been a square bitch
He ain't paying? Hit the fuckin' door
Talking slick, that Memphis shit
I be from that Haven click
Keep it ratchet so sweet
All these boys kiss my feet
I be on that queen shit
You better bless my realness
Stick your tongue up in my ass
You better show me who you fuckin' with
Run The Jewels
Love again, you gon' lose, I'm gon' win
Let's have an orgy
I'mma share your ass with all my friends (Yeah, ho!)

[Hook 2: Gangsta Boo]
He want this clit in his mouth all day
He want this clit in his mouth all day (Yeah, ho!)
I put my clit in his mouth all day

I put my clit in his mouth all day

He want this clit in his mouth all day
I've got this fool in love again (Love again)[Yelawolf]

So why would I wanna break shit down for you
Better me confuse with the punchlines and bars that I launch
Here the king of debauchery come, with a cracker dick
To fuck you in that pussy carpet you munch
If I'm not hardly the one
You must be barely the one billionth
Really you kidding, bitch I'm the prodigal son
And I'm stunting like my Daddy
D-dr-d-drinking like my Mama
C-c-country like my uncles
Stuttering like a CD in a donk
BUMP, BUMP, BUMP, BUMP
And I'm in a blue Chevy
Running over motherfuckers in first
I ain't even shift gears yet
I ain't even here yet, I'm outta this Earth
Right, yeah ho
But I just hit the surface
And I'm bout to walk into a bank
With a shank and a black can of paint to check the clerk
Where the keys
Bitch you better check your purse
I gotta brick of herb
And I hit the syrup
And I'm feeling like I might just hit the curb
So get the fuck outta my way buddy

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Me and Yelawolf
Tear the roof off this motherfucker
You ain't got the umph
You're a hoof to the foot of an elephant
Hello toots, you look so eloquent
That's what I tell a cunt
Come sit up front cause you're kicking my seat
And I'm trying to tell the cashier what I want
They say I act like an asshole
When I pull up at the White Castle
And I ask for an appli-cation
Throw it back in her face and
Tell the bitch I'm a rapper, then I wack her
In the head with a Whopper
That I bought from BK, you expect me to be proper
Bitch you better pop in a CD of me immediately slut, ho
Skidda dee da da
Prada, not a chance
I was thinking about buying you some clothes
But Target's closed
So I decided to mosey on over to K-Mart but the doors
Was locked, what about some shoes I thought
Great I suppose
So I go to Payless but what'dya know
They didn't carry a size eight in hoes
Oh, this is ugly boy swag
Putting toe tags on you motherfucking ho bags
What a Trailer Trash pioneer
I am yeah, that's why I'm here
I don't got a rhyme book it's more like a motherfuckin' diary of diarrhea
Me, Yelawolf and Gangsta Boo came here to show you a thing or two
Bout sign language, middle fingers aimed at you
So we don't gotta scream at you
Ow, I just bit my bottom lip, it was an accident
I went to go tell em all to go get fucked
But I'm never gonna bite my tongue
Little bitch, throw it up

[Outro]

{Eminem} What the fuck is this, White dog

I hope that you do too
I'll call before I come
I won't just pop up over, out the blue
No, after you

[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
Oh, thank you Lord for throwing some shy
Bones in my body let me tell you why
If not so, I'd be too, too bad
When it comes to pink polka dots and plaids
Glad to meet you, my name is Dre
But you can call me Possum Aloysuis Jenkins
Andre 3000 for short
And naaw I don't want to see your thongs
I kinda dig them old school cute regular draws
And I will pause for your cause

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
I'm a gentleman, I'm a satisfy your soul
And then I'm a get mine
Like Wimbledon we back and forth across the court
Until we give out, do you take it all or spit it out
Are you faking the funk and living a lie
Do you really know what it feels like
To have no control over the G spot?
It's like a brand new pair of Reeboks or a junkie freshly detoxed
You feel the tingling all over like convulsions or the rooster pox
I used to not give a damn
But now I make it a point just to please you
So you can go back and tell all your buddies, I Pretty D'd you

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Gangsta Boo]
Let's see what you wanna do with the Gangsta Boo
Let's cut, nigga, nigga what, I'll cut you too
Coming through in a Escalade limo, tint with shade
Purple haze in the ashtray ready to get a blaze
What the biz nigga jump on in relax wit a lady
Wit a reputation known for sexing niggas till they crazy
Whatcha mean dog, telling a playa like Boo to call before I come
You a game I'm fucking on you for fun
Join the bandwagon nigga it's a Gangsta Boo party
Everybody wanna join come and freak wit somebody
Riding Jaguars, riding Prowlers all sports cars
Hitting strip bars wit the top down, fuck y'all
Groupie you need to be glad you even knew me
Do me and tell all my friends you truly blew me
Bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Eco]
Nigga you better dial 404-584 well bump all that
But shit you'd better call before you get here and that's a fact
Before you get your feelings hurt
Because you caught me playing nurse
Wit a stethoscope running around in one of those cute short white skirts
I tried to tell you, but you wouldn't respond to Aloysius
Peeped in the window saw me cooking shrimp
In high heels and washing dishes
For Daddy Fat Sax and it's something I couldn't explain
I know it's a dirty, dirty game, but you should called before you came

Let me pound that cake and put some cream on it
Yeah I like it but I ain't gonna put a ring on it
I'm tyrin to hit the back of the cervix and make you shake like you're nervous
Murk that shit without the funeral service
You got my dick hard looking just like a banana clip
Throw it back and I might just go down and take a lick

[Gangsta Boo Verse 2]
Pussy eatin niggas

I'm a shaker, you a mover
I'm a lion, you a cougar

[Gangsta Boo Verse 4]
Imma shaker and baby my body so tight

Pineapple pussy sweeter than a fruit basket

(Ok)
We can bang
You can get naked and I might make it rain

I'm so freaky behind closed doors
E-40 come and fuck me on the floor

[Hook][Intro: Gangsta Boo]
It's Clipping bitch

[Verse 1: Daveed Diggs]
Turnt than a motherfucker
Bought that ho a shot cause you wanna cuff her
All these other motherfuckers think they stuntin'
But they spot is 'bout to close
And they ain't pullin' nothin'
Walls smell like pussy when it sweat
Snort it to the face, but the club wet
Trying to get a taste, baby wanna flex
Sick of pushin' weight in an alley with a mind full of sex
She walk to the floor, leave the bar stool soakin'
Drop it down low, make it wade like the ocean
And every man up in here wanna see her bust it open
But you ain't gonna get it if you so soft-spoken
Flashing lights, molly dreams, face down low
DJ screaming "last call", that liquor dark, that dick gone hard
With visions of her legs up in the air over your face under her ass
And breaking lamps from beating pussy purple cause she like it fast
Wha-wha-wha-what's your fantasy? Ass like Trina, face like Beyonce
And tell your story, try to whip her fine ass free
Cause she's probably used to ballers and ballin' you may not be
But shit, this spot's about to close and you still ain't pulled you a freak?

[Hook: Daveed Diggs]
It's the last song of the night
Don't forget to tip the bartender
You got fucked up, that's alright
That's not the only thing you came to do
Cause there's bad ones all around
And you ain't pulled your one yet
If you ain't locked it down by now
Then it's time to figure out who fuckin' tonight
Who fucking tonight, who fuckin' tonight, who fuckin' tonight

[Verse 2: Gangsta Boo]
I'm drunker than I ever been, higher than I ever been
Don't you want to take me to the bar to get a shot again?
Don't you want to take me home? Don't you want to see me roam?
Music beatin', twerkin' to the sound, I'm all up in my zone
Lookin' for a victim, caught him slippin', I just want some sex
Nothing else to do when I leave the club so that's the best thing next
Here, just take my number, when you leave be sure to send a text
I'll be at the Waffle House waitin', baby fuck the rest
If you at the club and you feel trashed and it about to close
Make sure you have a freak that knows how to bend and touch her toes
Make sure that that boy know, he gotta play when he weighin' that soul(?)
He get to see me do dances and shit, doin' a split and I'm killin' this shit

[Hook: Daveed Diggs]
It's the last song of the night
Don't forget to tip the bartender
You got fucked up, that's alright
That's not the only thing you came to do
Cause there's bad ones all around
And you ain't pulled your one yet
If you ain't locked it down by now
Then it's time to figure out who fuckin' tonight
Who fucking tonight, who fuckin' tonight, who fuckin' tonight

[Verse 3: Daveed Diggs]
Yeah, it's Clipping bitch
Tab on the bank card, molly on the gums
Last shot dark, brain, 808 bass drums
Laser in the eyeball, callous on the feet
Cab to the someplace, head in the back seat
Stumble up a staircase, floor missing boards
Hands fumbling through denim - keys, keys open doors
Tumble to the futon, teeth into soft skin
Fists full of weave, rip, lick, suck, coughin'
Acrylic on the spine, hand prints on the hips
Rug burn on the knees, salt on the lips
Beat it up, spread it out, bust it open, take it down
Eyes rolling, bones shaking, lungs weak, breathing in somebody else's breath
Shit, hold up, what's your name, what's up with that breakfast?

[Hook: Daveed Diggs]
It's the last song of the night
Don't forget to tip the bartender
You got fucked up, that's alright
That's not the only thing you came to do
Cause there's bad ones all around
And you ain't pulled your one yet
If you ain't locked it down by now
Then it's time to figure out who fuckin' tonight
Who fucking tonight, who fuckin' tonight, who fuckin' tonight[Hook 3x]

Give me three G of white
A eight ball for the night
When you wanna get cha lean on it's nothing but that yellow

If its a good night, I can easy make a thousand daily
If they bring the bustas they proverted keep ya mouth away
Hit the, hit the stage, bring it, bring it on to the flo'
Stick the money in my lace strap if you want a show
I'm a private dancer, be yo love slave for a while
Most niggas trip, when you diss, tip 'em wit they eyes
Flawging ass niggas really muthafuck'n kill me
How you gonna disrespect a muthafuck'n lady
Why you in the club when you ain't spending no cheese
Get yo ass out till you ready to spend some money

Until we give out, do you take it all or spit it out
Are you faking the funk and living a lie
Do you really know what it feels like
To have no control over the G spot?
It's like a brand new pair of Reeboks or a junkie freshly detoxed
You feel the tingling all over like convulsions or the rooster pox
I used to not give a damn
But now I make it a point just to please you
So you can go back and tell all your buddies, I Pretty D'd you

[Verse 4: Eco]
Nigga you better dial 404-584 well bump all that
But shit you'd better call before you get here and that's a fact
Before you get your feelings hurt
Because you caught me playing nurse
Wit a stethoscope running around in one of those cute short white skirts
I tried to tell you, but you wouldn't respond to Aloysius
Peeped in the window saw me cooking shrimp
In high heels and washing dishes
For Daddy Fat Sax and it's something I couldn't explain
I know it's a dirty, dirty game, but you should called before you came

[Hook][Intro]
Hey, they say they want that old Gangsta Boo.

Mask to my fucking face, I'm fiending to increase my high
Eyeballs is like red as hell, these bitches better recognize
Rolling a blunt to inhale in my lungs, I'm feeling so so high
Now I'm high, really high; mayne, I think that I can fly
Chilling at the Honeycomb Hideout with my niggas who
Got them choppers and Glocks not locked
And best believe they ass'll shoot
Ratchet bitches all up in my mix with they pettiness
Better get the hell up out my face before a player click
M-E-M-P-H-I-S, rep it like it's nothing left
G-A-N-G-S-T-A -- here to stay, you hoes heard what I said
Creeping through the darkness of the cut with my cousin Nate
Fear no evil, hear no evil -- got my Locs on face, I'm straight
Meet me at the crib about a quarter to eight
Bring my package, don't be late
Catch you slipping, you won't live
Cause niggas gotta pay they bills
Fall up in the jungle, hungry ape, go eat your face
Rip your heart up out your chest
Indiana Jones, ya bitch

I'm Indiana Jones, ya bitch
I'm Indiana Jones, ya bitch
Rip your heart up out your chest
Indiana Jones, ya bitch
I'm Indiana Jones, ya bitch[Verse 1: Killer Mike]
Reminiscin-in' on our time of innocence
When we drank that Hennessy, ate on lamb and venison
Face fucked you in your kitchenette, fucked you like we tusslin'
Do you fuck your husb-al-and? Like, do y'all be tusslin'?
Do you wear the muzzlin'? Do you ask him pretty please?
Do you crawl on hands and knees, like you used to do for me
Oh, you such a dirty girl, the world won't let you be yourself
I won't accept nothing else, I be having none of that
You be takin' all of this, pleasure come from punishment
Your threshold astonishin', I think I'm in love again
Found my perfect drug again, feel better than heroin
You love my alpha arrogance, 2 Live Crew the narrative
And there it is

Smart and full of filth and joy
You been with some little boys
Now you're with a grown-up man
One who'll actually understands
Kid gloves are not on my hands
I will never condescend
Now spread yourself
She smiled a bit
Gripped the outline of my shit
Oh, my god, I love this chick
I must put my tongue in this
Into every space I go
Give me everything you am
She said, "No, you gimme first"

Well let me tell you a little story

Lick my pussy real good
Kept me stuck with lots of wood
Kept my bank account on swoll
Sniffed my pussy like a rose, smokin' on dro
Made a porn tape, that nigga is a pro, you ain't know?
He had a lot of bad bitches in his past
But I was the one who turned that boy into a motherfuckin' man

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Whole box of that Bombay, fuck me and my posse
It's Juicy J, I'm a rich nigga
Ain't a lot to choose, can't copy
She came over clean and I left that bitch sloppy
High on that Actavis, a nigga, I stay glossy
Zan bars and molly, I be on designer
If you let your chick go, I swear that you won't find her
My diamonds gon' blind her, Louis V remind her
Big bags of that cash, blowing hoes who shaking ass
Everything I pay in cash, the Lambo going extra fast
And the passenger is extra bad
We flying in the whip and I'm smoking gas
That check ain't never gon' stop, that's why you extra mad

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I drop weight, that's how I get a load off
Pitbull in my passenger seat is my road dog
If your girl ride with me, she take her clothes off
I'm smoking on the strongest pack till I dose off
Me and Project Pat-ah, this the new chapter
All this fucking 'caine like a motherfucking cap-ah
And I'm from the A, I'm bout to bring it back-ah
Tip blocked the way and Ludacris is a actor
Burning like tobacco, southside trapper
Spell 'south' wit' a F, the 'F' stand for fuck-ah
And you know I did it, I do it, like, daily
Fuck wit' me, I'll show you how to turn a brick into a Bentley
Money, money man, ten hundred grand
Nigga, that's a mil, that pussy deep, quicksand (deep)
All up in that thang like "you it" when I do it
Chain so dumb, got yo' nigga looking stupid

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lola Monroe]
Why y'all niggas be loafing? Fuck is up with that bread?
I ain't the type to be open, 'less you talking that head
Pounds up in that trash bag, bricks up in that MCM
I ain't tripping off no bitch, straight life for it is 10 PM
Stick his tongue inside the box while he chop a eighth down
Fuck him, fuck him, knock him out in the eighth round
All white Lambi, call that bitch albino
I know, I know, it get wetter than a wino

[Verse 4: Project Pat]
I'm that nigga that ya looking for, clean, ho, forget the toes
Chandeliers in my ears and a pocket full of dough
Polo boots, Polo shirt, in demand like some purp
Ain't gon' bust a nut, baby girl, till that coochie squirt
All night on them pills, blowing weed, popping bottles
Pouring rosé in your cup, baby, gon' take a swallow
I buy these hoes nice things, cooking candy rings
I sell 'em good dreams while they eating ding-a-ling

[Hook] (x2)[Verse 1: Chris Travis]
Move these fuck niggas out the way, bitch I'm coming through
Drink-laced blunt grape, damn, I'm 'bout to snooze
She wake me up, like good morning your highsness
I'm getting top, higher than a mountain lion
She do whatever I say, like I'm Simon
Bet that nigga be dead on arrivement
I'm a king with my feet on the horizon
And I'm hard to find like a lost license
Put the bottle on the dresser, bitch I need it
I read Proverbs when I'm feeling greedy
And right now, I feel like I ain't eatin'
So I got every fucking right to get greedy
Outta Memphis, a city full of heathens
Shit I'm one too, and I'm still breathing
I'm never in my city, but I'm always repping
Never in my mind, but always second guessing
A young nigga, with a old soul
Bitch I stay hot, that's why I'm so cold
I'm pouring up the Actavis, uh-oh
And my whip beat your ass like a drum-roll

[Hook: Chris Travis]
Money on my mind, money on my mental
Yeah your bitch fine, but your bitch simple
Money on my mind, money on my mental
Yeah your bitch fine, but your bitch simple
Money on my mind, money on my mental
That ain't your bitch, fuck nigga that's a rental
Money on my mind, money on my mental
That ain't your bitch, fuck nigga that's a rental
Money on my mind, money on my mental
Yeah your bitch fine, but your bitch simple
Money on my mind, money on my mental
That ain't your bitch, fuck nigga that's a rental

[Verse 2: Gangsta Boo]
Most bitches don't be understanding techniques
That's what it takes to be a real one in the streets, follow me
The B, the, the, the, U, the, the, the, D
I need, give me shotgun, I smoke the sticky with no seeds
Mane' you know how I be
Usually taking no shit from a bitch
Usually charging and breaking a trick
Been there and done that, as good as it gets
When I'm in Memphis I'm fucking with Chris
Travis, he savage, he one of the homies
Raider Klan bringing the phonk that ain't phony
Connecting the dots, I'm all about money
Your bitch so basic, she so simple, she a bummy ho
I be so pretty, I'm so gangsta', and a nigga know
Yo, I'm getting higher then them other suckers
1990's money, legendary on these lame busta's
I'm 'bout to cop the O two ways, sidekick
Motorola just to show 'em old school real shit
Money, money, money on my mental
It ain't accidental that I popped up like a pimple[DJ Paul]
Niggas you roll them dice
You better except how they fall
Nigga you fucking wit Juice
Nigga you fucking wit Paul
Nigga you fucking wit Boo
Nigga you fucking wit Black
Lil bitch you fucking wit Lord
Lil bitch you fucking wit Pat
Nigga you fucking wit Roc
Nigga you fucking wit Chat
And if you fuck wit La Chat
We blow your chest through your back
And if you fuck wit anyone else
I dont give a fuck
Because they dont plead and breed HCP nigga what

[Lord Infamous]
I always leave them in suspense
Better put up your defense
Cause this .44's intense
Niggas catch a body risk
Bloody Glock bloody trench
Bloody bodies on the fence
Bloody legion, all you bitches bloody six is in the midst
Oh my Lord, Infamous
Cock the hammer let it split
I'm the damager carnage
I'm the razor in your wrist
I'm the medicine you hit
Got you fucking throwing fits
Kicking chairs and swinging fists
How long can you get to this?
Play

[Crunchy Black]
It started way back when a nigga was a kid
I stick and move my nigga
That's the shit that I did
I broke a few fucking bones
And I cast few stones
I pulled a few fucking tone
Man that shit went wrong
You got me stuck in the zone
When a nigga doing wrong
I pop you once in your head with that goddamn chrome
Don't give a fuck motherfucker
If your family moarn
Shouldna stepped to me dawg
Shouldna stepped to me at all
You weak busta!

[Project Pat]
A mistaken ID
Wanna put me in the po-key
Cuz I'm on parole
Police swearing that they know he
Had to do the shit
Cuz Project Pat is a convict
Whose North Memphis raised
Hood bred taking no shit
If I did the hit
You'll be left okey dokey
Still selling dope on the motherfucking lowski
When I pull the tone
After that squeeze the trigger
On any punk bitch or a ho ass nigga!

[La Chat]
See I'mma go and have to kill a bitch
Empty the clip
I guess that's the only way
Or I'mma have to buy you a lick
La Chat ain't with that bullshit
I be burying hoes
And I'mma do it for the weather bitch
Fuck a low low
Man I'm a mean bitch I tell ya
I done been there done that
It ain't no mission I can't finish
Nothing ain't too tough for Chat
So if you catch me slippin ho
Fuck me wearing a mask
Cuz once I know its you fo sho
I'mma cremate ya ass

[Juicy J]
Can a nigga get chose in these kinda clothes
Have you seen a memphis playa
Ride bentley rose
I done told ya that I'm always gonna stand on ten toes
With a liquor bottle, crack, and a blunt already rolled
My cologne smell the curb
Just superb on these hoes
Hanging with these Memphis killas
With that candy round they nose
On my neck on my wrist
Is that jewelry that be froze
On my face is my cardier shades and my golds

[T-Roc]
Is this a stain to be making?
It's a T-Roc creation
No roofer sniper you facing
I'm like an offspring of Satan
My innovation of danger
From the slugs of the chamber
Keep more guns than a ranger
Prepared to mangle a stranger
My competition deleted
From verbal telekenisis
Placing bodies in ditches
And leave them stinking like fecis
Once the list is depleted
Fold my dollars like creaces
My coalition is the Hypnotize Camp
Its no secret nigga!

[Gangsta Boo]
If I go leave me a stain
I got two Glocks and a blunt
Bout to let you bitches know
That Gangsta Boo don't give a fuck
I got diamonds on my wrist
I got diamonds in my teeth
Is it a bird?
Is it a bee?
Can you bitches picture me?
Talking shit about Ms. Lady
When you know you wanna fuck
Ya'll round town clowing
Doing donuts in the truck
Got you bitches to the flo'
Got the nigga take his dough
I be Mrs. "Where Da Dollas At?"
You hatas know the score
I be ballin ATL
I hit round up on the cell
Got them meet me at the swiss
And bring some niggas to the tale
Might as well go on playa
Ya'll ain't ready for the gangsta ho
I be rippin bitches
Like guerilla, murder, kill ho
I dont give a fuck
What you groupies say up in the streets
Catch me off in gucci sheets
Sleeping living luxury
Just to give you hoes
All the answers you been waiting fo
I remain the undisputed champ
Nigga ye ain't know?

Ha Ha...Bitch!Gangsta Boo joined Three 6 Mafia when she was only a teen. To this day, she is still the first and only female member of the group. After a successful run with the group, she left due to money disputes and embarked upon a flourishing solo career. One of the most active and consistent female MCs in the game, Gangsta Boo has worked with some of the South's best over the course of her career. Memphis born and bred, her sound will be forever engrained in the traditions and classic sound of the city. Honest, hard-hitting, and forever unafraid of her competition, Gangsta Boo has a sound that will continue to be influential for years to come. These days, you can find her working on a new project, Witch, with fellow MC La Chat and producer DJ Paul

We talked how the Memphis sound is taken without homage paid, the influence of bounce music on her own style, the origins of "get your broke ass out of the club", some of her most iconic lines, and more
