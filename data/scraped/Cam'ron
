[Produced by Kanye West]

[Intro]
Wished I had told ooh was the only one (uh oh!)
But it's too late, it's too late he's gone

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
You sweat her and I ain't talkin 'bout a Coogi
You a Big L and I ain't talkin 'bout Cool J
See me at the airport, at least twenty Louis
Treat me like the Prince and this my sweet brother Numpsay
(Brother Numpsay!) groupies say I'm too choosy
Take em to the show and talk all through the movies
Says she want diamonds, I took her to Ruby Tuesdays
If we up in Fridays, I still have it my way

[Hook]
Too late, we, gone we striving home
Gone I ride on chrome, it's too late

[Verse 2]
Y'all don't want no prob' from me
What you rappers could get is a job from me
Maybe you could be my intern and in turn
I'll show you how I cook up summer in the winter
Aaron love the raw dog, when will he learn
Caught something on the Usher tour, he had to let it burn
Plus he already got three children
Arguin' over babysitters like bitch it's yo turn
"Damn Ye it'd be stupid to diss you
Even your superficial raps is super-official"
R-R-R-Roc pastel with Gucci on
With TV's in the ride, throw a movie on
Said he couldn't rap now he at the top with Doobie Long
Cause I dookied on any song that they threw me on, gone

[Hook]
We striving home, gone
[Cam] I ride on chrome
We striving home, gone
[Cam] Killa, I ride on chrome

[Verse 3: Cam'Ron]
Knock knock, who's there? Killa Cam, Killa who?
Killa Cam, hustler, grinder, guerilla true
Oh my chinchilla blue, blue you ever dealt with a dealer
Well here's the deal, ma we going to the dealer woo
No concealing, no ceiling I don't need a roof
Act up, get out, I don't need you poof
Poof be gone, damn tough luck dag
Dag niggas still doing puff-puff-pass
Pull the truck up fast and I tell em
Hey back in a touched up Jag shit
Y'all niggas wanna get in Cam's cerebellum
An old man just gon' tell em too late
Then I see how y'all gonna react when I'm gone
My last girl want me back then I'm on
Fine stay, you got the grind hey
Came back, read what the sign say
Yes I know you wanna see my demise
Yeah you church boy, acting like a thief in disguise
Ain’t even my size, see the greed in my eyes
Ask Abby, I hustle, brought weed to the Chi, shit
And that ain't even a lie, please believe me
Gave Weezie a piece of the pie and
You can ask George or Regina
The whole West Side I explore with the Bimmer now

[Hook]
We striving home, I ride on chrome
Listen, homeboy, move on
That's your best bet, why's that, Cons'?

[Verse 4: Consequence]
I been pouring out some liquor for the fact that my pal's gone
And trying to help his Momma with the fact that her child gone
And since we used to bubble like a tub full of Calgon
Guess it's only right that I should help her from now on
But since they got afoul on what could've gone wrong
Now they asking Cons, how long has this gone on
And maybe all this money might have gone to my head
Cause they got me thinking money might have gone to the Feds
So I had gone to the dread, but he had gone up to bed
And when I came the next morning he was gone with my bread
And with that being said I had gone on my instincts
And gone to the spots where they go to get mixed drinks
But looking back now, I should've gone to the crib
And rented Gone With the Wind, cause I'da gone in by ten
But I had gone with my friend, and we had gone to the bar
And heard a nigga talking shit so I had gone to the car
And now the judge is telling me that I had gone too far
And now we gone for twenty years doing time behind bars
And since I gone to a cell for some petty crimes
I guess I gone to the well one too many times, cause I'm gone

[Verse 5: Kanye West]
Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh uh uh onnn, uh uh-uh onnn
Uh-uh onnn, uh uh-uh
I'm ahead of my time, sometimes years out
So the powers that be won't let me get my ideas out
And that make me wanna get my advance out
And move to Oklahoma and just live at my aunt's house
Yeah, I romance the thought of leaving it all behind
Kanye step away from the lime
Light like when I was on the grind
In the One-Nine-Nine-Nine
Before model chicks was bending over or
Dealerships asked me Benz or Rover man
If I could just get one beat on Hova
We could get up off this cheap-ass sofa
What the summer of the Chi got to offer an eighteen-year-old
Sell drugs or get a job you gotta play your role
My dog worked at Taco Bell, hooked us up plural
Fired a week later, the manager count the churros
Sometimes I can't believe it when I look up in the mirro'
How we out in Europe, spending Euros
They claim you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I know I got it, I don't know what y'all on
I'ma open up a store for aspiring MCs
Won't sell 'em no dream, but the inspiration is free
But if they ever flip sides like Anakin
You'll sell everything including the mannequin
They got a new bitch, now you Jennifer Aniston
Hold on I'll handle it, don't start panickin', stay calm
Shorties at the door cause they need more
Inspiration for they life, they souls, and they songs
They said, "Sorry, Mr. West is gone"[Verse 1: Lil' Cease]
Yo I be buyin em V's, so all my girls be eyein Cease
Comin backstage, dyin to get pleased
You got me, I rock thee, Versace and linen
While you stop your grinnin wit bunch of foxy women
Why you speed ball with cards, that's invalid
I get clothes, custom made, from a stylist
Cruise in my Lexus Land with no mileage
While you walk the street until your feet get calloused
Take you on a natural high, like a pilot
It be all good, toss your clothes like a salad
When it's all over put your vote in my ballot
It's my diner, I'm Mel, and you're Alice
Spend a night, in Lil' Cease palace
It be all good as long as you don't act childish
While you standin there with the Crist' in your cup
If worse come to worse keep this on the hush, uhh

[Hook: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I know you seen me on the video (true)
I know you heard me on the radio (true)
But you still don't pay me no attention
Listenin to what your girlfriends mention
He's a slut, he's a ho, he's a freak
Got a different girl every day of the week
It's cool, not tryin to put a rush on you
I had to let you know that I got a crush on you

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
Aiyyo shorty, won't you go get a bag of the lethal
I'll be undressed in the bra all see through
Why you count your jewels thinkin' I'mma cheat you?
The only one thing I wanna do is freak you
Keep your stone sets, I got my own baguettes
And I'll be doin things that you won't regret
Lil Kim the Queen Bee, so you best take heed
Shall I proceed? (Yes indeed!)
I'mma throw shade, if I can't get paid
Blow you up to your girl like the Army grenade
You can slide on my ice like the Escapade
And itchy-gitchy-yaya with the marmalade
Who me? Not you, oh yes, who's he?
I even dig yo' man's style, but I love yo' profile
Whisper in your ear and get you all shook up
But don't blush, just keep this on the hush

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil' Cease]
While you tryin to catch Sea Breeze, I'm in the PV's
All chrome D3's, decked out TV's
CD's with crazy bass, keep my lady laced
Don't be fooled by the baby face
I hope ya not, cause your thighs got me hot
Only one plan, that's to rise to the top
I told you before, when I first pursued
I want a interlude, in the nude

[Lil' Kim]
You know I love the way you feel-a, sip my tequil-a
Works from the dealers, all in chinchilla
Heat up the clutch, seven-fifty deluxe
Then we speed down the hutch, breakin trees in the dutch
I'm not the one you sleep wit, to eat quick
Want a cheap trick, better go down to FreakNik
You got to hit me off, buy this girl gifts of course
So I look sick, in my six, with my Christian LaCroix[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Look sucker, this my gun butter
Street fighter bitches, this the up cutter
Nunchucka', no time to ducka'
Sign of the cross, cause this is her last suppa'
Play with me, check who came with me
I bought a couple 9′s, plus the k's with me
I breeze through Queens to check some bad bitches
I stunt so hard, assess the damages
Cause this that aw, this is that aw
And yes, I body bitches go get the bandages
Young yummy, fuck you got for me
I hate a phony bitch that front that chum chummy
I'm me top shotta' drop the top toppa'
Big fat pussy with a icy watch

[Hook]
I am your leader, yes I am your leader
You're not a believer, suck a big dick

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
When I fly, it's one letter and one number
You wack hoes could get hot for one summer
After that the queen will still reign here
I'm Santa Claus to these hoes without a reindeer
Saint Nick, Ross, hey Rick, I just got a toy, cost 850
Now I'm in the hood, niggas is getting woodies
Hit up Hot Topic, Nicki Minaj hoodies
I'm a brand. bitch, I'm a brand
Go to Harlem, and get Cam
It's dipset, get your dick wet
Boarded the big jet, and got a big check
Now you tell me, who the fuck is winning
I'm on my Russell Simmons, Nicki denim, Nicki linen

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Jealous niggas is gossip, watch me tie up my laces
Bitches be jocking, tell by the look on they faces
8 digits I'm clocking, a lot of gold in my bracelet
7 figures on watches, I told my mama I made it
Made a deal for my project, just give me 10 mill I'm gravy
I went back to the projects, and 2 mill in Mercedes
I get head from your lady, have her bill me later
I'm on school with the hustle, just gave Rihanna my pager
Heart break hotel, I'm in the A-Rod suite
Rolls Royce wood, I'm talking playoff seat
Know that boy busy cause he balling, I like to play all week
Monday night with the ‘RAW’, I’m Vince McMahon with a beat
Power slamming them hammers I get you handle for free
So where the fuck is her manners, she gives brain while I tweet
DM, in the BM, you cm, you bucking, you love it
Motherfuckers on my dick, suck it

[Hook] (2x)

[Verse 4: Cam'ron]
See the car is European but got imported from Tokyo
Looking like a shark, the nose call it Pinocchio
Well off, wealthy, LV logo
Middle of July but the wrist on snowflow
Only do the Aspens, y'all can have the Poconos
I'm sunny and you must suck collagen dose, Calogero
Ride the whip, 5 on the hip, live with the pies got 9 for the flip
High with a bitch, she cry for the dick, oh my know why I'm fly as it gets
Now I need an aspirin
She said "You're only Cam'ron"
Girlfriend you don't know Cam'ron from nowhere so don't go tampering
You're just a nail I hammer
'Nother girl that's on my camera
My name you cannot slander at all girl, watch your manners
She run and tell her mother, "I think I love him, Nana."
Because you sat upon my lap? Nah, I ain't Santa
They call me pied piper, OJ no glove I knife her
Never been a lifer, even do Rikers
Why would I fight? Don’t even like her

[Hook] (x2)[Hook: Freekey Zekey + (Toya)]
Hey ma (wassup)
Let's slide (all right)
All right - and we gon get it on tonight
You smoke? (I smoke)
I drink (me too)
Well good - cause we gon' get high tonight
Got drops (got coupes) got trucks (got jeeps)
All right - cause we gon' take a ride tonight
So ma (wassup) Let's slide (all right)
All right - and we gon' get it on tonight

[Verse 1: Juelz Santana]
Yo, now I was downtown clubbin', ladies night
Seen shorty, she was crazy right
And I approach baby like: "Ma, what's your age and type?"
She looked at me and said, you's a baby, right
I told her I'm 18 and live a crazy life
Plus I'll tell you what the 80's like
And I know what ladies like
Need a man that's polite, listens and takes advice
I could be all three, plus I can lay the pipe
Come with me, come stay the night"
She looked at me laughing; like "boy, your game is tight"
I'm laughin' back like, sure you're right, get in the car
And don't touch nothin', sit in the car
Let's discuss somethin', either we lovin' or I'll see you tomorrow
Now we speeding up the West Side
Hand creepin up her left side, I'm ready to do it
Ready to bone, ready for dome
55th exit, damn, damn, already we home
Now let's get it on

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
Now that I got a girl, my ex wanna holla and spit
Told me to acknowledge her quick
She like "Cam, stop fronting on that Dave Hollister tip
Come over let's swallow and sip." I'm like: "momma is sick
I promise you dick, usually have a problem with chicks
(Why?) They all say I'm rotten and rich"
But not her, boobies' real, high heel dooby feel
Plus got them Gucci nails
You a cutie still
And this my down girl too - ain't no groupie deal
We left the movies with Uzis, Suzuki wheels
To the jacuzzi, I tell you, my boo be's real
I mean she do be winnin', Louis spinnin'
Go to the crib, she got the Gucci linen
I see boo be grinnin'
She looked and said: "Cam, I know that you be sinnin"
"Naw! I'm a changed man, look at the Range, ma'am
(Look) I got a whole new game plan"
Looked and said: "That's nothing but game, Cam"
She was right, she was up in the Range, man
Dropped her off at the L, now I'm flippin' the cell
That's right, I had to call up L

[Cam'ron & Juelz Santana]
Yo L (what up?) I hit (what else)
Plus dome (say word) and we got it on tonight

[Hook][Verse 1]
With the goons I spar
Stay in tune with ma
She like, "damn
This the realest since 'Kumbaya'"
Bomaye, Killa Cam, my lord
Still the man with the pan
Scrilla fam, on board
Bitches, they want to neuter me
Niggas, they want to tutor me
The hooligan in Houlihan's
Maneuvering's nothin' new to me
Doggy, I'm from the land of grind
Pan pan: gram or dime?
Not toes or MC
When I say "Hammer time"
Beef: I hammer mine
When I get my hands on nines
If I had on 'Bama line
Corduroys, Cam will shine
Canary burgundy:
I call it "Lemon Red"
Yellow diamonds in my ear
Call em "Lemonheads"
Lemonhead end up dead
Ice like Winnipeg
Gemstone, Flinstones
You could say I'm friends with Fred
You unhappy scrappy?
I got Pataki at me
Bitches say I'm "tacky daddy"
Range look like Laffy Taffy

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm from where Nicky Barnes got rich as fuck
Rich and A hit the kitchens then were pitchin' up
Rob Base, Mase, Doug E Fresh switched it up
I do both, who am I to fuck tradition up?
So I parked in a tow-away zone
Chrome...I don't care
That car a throwaway, homes
Welcome to Harlem
Where you welcome to problems
Off of furlough, fellow felons get pardons
Them niggas knew we bang
Stood out like Pootie Tang
Soon as the stoolie sings
That when the toolie sing!
Bang! Bang! came from that movie ring
Snap, crack jewelry bling
Flapjack, ooh he bring
Clack-clack, "ooh he ring!"
Bad rap, cuties cling
Ass cap, put em in the river
I'm the sushi king
And I'mma keep ya fresh
Let the fish eat ya flesh
Yes sir, please confess
Just say he's the best

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
How dope is this?
Teach you how to rope a chick
What you want: coke or piff?
Got it all, smoke or sniff?
And you know my drift
Used to figures, dough and shit
You a rooster nigga
This a roaster, bitch
And I roast ya bitch
That's how it usually ends
Tell her and her groupie friends
Go get their coochie cleansed
We the moody Gucci, Louis and Pucci men
Escada, Prada
The chopper it got the Uzi lens
Bird's-eye view
The birds I knew flip birds
Bird gangs, it was birds I flew
And word I blew off herb I grew
I would serve on stoops
Now swerve in coupes[Produced by Just Blaze]

[Intro: Cam'ron]
Just Blaze! (oh baby)
Oh baby, uh, killa!

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
All the girls see the (boy), look at his kicks (boy)
Look at his car (boy), all I say is (oh boy)
Look mami, I'm no good, I'm so hood
Clap at your soldiers sober, then leave after it's over
Killa! I'm not your companion, or your man's stand-in
Hit me when you wanna get rammed in, I'll be scramblin'
With lots of mobsters, shop for lobsters
Cops and robbers, listen every block is blaka (blaka!)
But she like the way I diddy bop, you peeped that?

She want the (boy) so I give her the (boy)
Now she screamin out (boy, boy, boy, boy)
Now she playin with herself, Cam dig it out, lift her up
Ma, it's just a fuck, girl, get it out, pick on up

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
Y'all niggas can't fuck with the (boy), I'm tellin' ya (Boy)

That's my (boy, boy, boy, boy)

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
When he got caught with the (boy) we went to court for the (boy)
Just me and my (boy) and we sayin' (oh boy)
Be on the block with my (boy) with the rock or the (boy)
When the cops come - Squalie!

PJ's, old school, eighteenth at the sports bar
Eight or nine on the (boy), holla at your boy
Killa, holla, listen

You'll be D-O-A (boy) your moms will say (oh boy)

Shit, matter of fact, Guru start poppin' 'em
Then slap up this (boy), clap up his (boy)
Wrap up his (boy), get them gats (oh boy)
Diplomats are them (boy) for the girls and the (boy)
Say (boy, boy, boy, boy)

[Verse 4: Juelz Santana]
Now when they see Cam and his (boy), they say damn (oh boy)
Santana's that (boy) that squeeze hammers (oh boy)
Cannons and bandanas, blammers we don't brandish
Blam at your man's canvas then scram with your man's leaded
And I'm back with my (boy)

[Cam'ron]
Until that man is vanished
Away in the Grand Canyon, these kids are grand standin'
Niggas demand ransom over them grams scramblin (boy, boy, boy, boy)
Well fuck it, Van Damme 'em, Cam'll blam blam 'em
Call up his (boy), I'm down south tannin
Mami, I got the remedy, Tommy's I bet the enemy
Hire me somebody but now my body your feelin' finicky
Killa and Capo we chill in Morocco for reela
We got doe chinchilla doe and fill with them hollows, huh
It's the (boy), I said it's the (boy)
I'm the (boy, boy, boy, boy)
Killa[Produced by Kanye West and Brian Miller]

[Intro]
Killa! Baby!
Kanye this that 1970s Heron flow huh?
Yeah let's speed it up

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
Ayo street mergers I legislated
The nerve I never hated
On murders pre-meditated
Absurd! I hesitated
Observe: cock and spray
Hit you from a block away
Drinking sake on a Suzuki we in Osaka Bay
Playing soccer, stupid, stay in a sucker's place
Pluck ya ace, take ya girl, fuck her face
She dealing with Killa so you love her taste
She swallowing Killa cause she love the taste
I got brought up with crooking
Kitchen orders that I'm cooking
But got caught up with the jooks you woulda thought I was from Brooklyn
It gets boring just looking
Did like Bill Cosby, pouring in the pudding
Now the dashboard is wooden from a hard-tangled grammar
Interior, inferior, star-spangled banner
Car game bananas
My man Santana
Guns everywhere, like the car came with hammers

[Hook: Kanye West]
They trying to say he (down, down)
I hear niggas saying he (down, but not out)
But our flow is the truest
The games in the nooses
Our girls is the models
They coochies the juiciest

Yeah, they say he (down, down)
Yeah, they say he (down, but not out)
Cause I’m back on my grind
Money back on my mind
Ye' and Killa Cam', the world is mine

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
I treat bitches straight up, like Simon Says
Open vagina: put ya legs behind ya head
Cop me Air Ones, hon, lime and red
You got pets? Me too: mine are dead
Fox, minks, gators that's necessary
Accessories, my closet's a "Pet Sematary"
I get approached by animal activists
I live in a zoo
I run scandals with savages
All my niggas get together to gather loot
Bodyguard for what? Dog, I'd rather shoot
I go to war, old Timbs, battered boots
Hand grenade, goggles and a parachute
Ya'll don't even know the name of my flip
It was "Touch Me, Tease Me" when Case was the shit
You don't know bout the cases I get:
Court case, briefcase, suitcase, cases of Cris

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
Ayo you dealing with some sure shit
My bitches pure thick
Play razor tag, slice ya face, you're it!
It's I who come by drive-thru
Gator-toed Mauri, three quarters, sky blue
Look at mami: eyes blue, 5'2''
I approached her "Hi boo, how you?
Pony skin Louis? Oh, you fly too
You a stewardess? Good ma, I fly too"
Now a nigga got baking to bake
Harlem Shake? Nah, I'm in Harlem shaking awake
Shaking to bake, shaking the Jakes
Kill you, shoot the funeral up and Harlem Shake at your wake
Just ya picture though, you still taped in a lake
I'm laughing; you couldn't wait to escape
For anyone who owed the dough, I had to load the fo
I hoped a nigga heard when I said "I told you so"

[Outro]
Mine
Killa you already know Harlem
Whole Midwest, Detroit, Nap town, St. Louis
Chicago of course
Westside, holla at me
Southside wild hundreds
You know what it is Ohio
Columbus, holla at ya boy
You know what else I do:
Dayton, Youngstown, Cleveland, Cincinnati[Verse 1 - Jim Jones]
Ayo my Dip Set Taliban, we are not a crew
We're more like a movement, more like in tune with
The moon and the stars
Some say I'll soon be doomed for them bars
But I could be caught - pissy clubs
Saloons and some bars
Industry think that they grooming a star - nah
I'm more like a thug misproving the odds
Run around my city all crazy
With my goons in some cars

[Bridge - Cam'ron]
I tell 'em
Wake up, wake up
Gotta go get that cake up, break up
Divide that payroll, ayo
Go get that yayo, yayo
Killa, paper, holla at Pedro
On the 8-0 and wait for my son, the lay low
Ba' bro

[Cam'ron]
When I beef, names will be said, tool will be spread
Two in your head, body be bagged, eulogy read
Dog in the news will get read
Cause what I deal with is usually feds
On the first

[Hook]
Ayo, ayo, ayo, ayo
It's the first of the month
Yayo yayo! Yayo yayo!
It's the first of the month

[Verse 2 - Juelz Santana]
Now I'm the type of dude
Post up, sell drugs on your property
Stone cold hustler, ain't no fucking denying me
I sell drugs in varieties: You want it? I got it
You see it, you like it
We count it, you buy it from me
I'm what the people call a "menace to the public society"
Fuck 'em I'm riding, my gun on the side of me
Fuck it, I'm driving, I'm puffing, high as can be
I'm speeding, I'm weaving
I'm bugging, my eye on the street
Cam signed to the Roc, it's time that we eat
Harlem's back, this time it's for keeps
You rolling or not?
The Takeover's now, y'all focused or not?
We been ready it's just that our promotion was not
But I can't blame no one for this, I'm all right with that
Can't be racist cause I sell too much white for that
So I decided I'mma milk these crackers
For all their milk and crackers
Until I'm rich and these mills don't matter
You niggas follow my plot?
If not, swallow these shots, Santana swallow your block
I run with enforcers, big dudes and bosses
Black, British and Walter, the phone call will cost ya'
Keep rolling in them caravans acting
We got big trucks with chrome Taliban action
Send one up to Jabar, my nigga maxed in
T-Money's home and he's never going back in

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Cam'ron]
Aiyo, I swear to God, you think I had a violin the way I fiddle triggers
How you older than me and still a little nigga?
On the first, I hate these chickens
Get their check, hair, nails done
Steak and chicken for the fridge
And their kids fly.. I ain't open, friend
On the 11th, you gonna be broke again
Word to Jehova man, hoes in they shoes
Barking like a Doberman
Coming to see Cam for some coke again

[Jim Jones]
Shit, it's the first of the month
Yo, I'm the first on the block for the cycle
A rock that is first like shoots from a rifle
See they tainted our image
It's fucked up how the game painted our image
They say we dangerous people
Why? Because we sell caine to the people
That don't be the reason I be aiming this eagle, my aims to get equal
The first and fifteenth's got some restraints on my people[Fibo]
Maman, écoute je passe à la télé
Mon son fait la B.O de ce reportage sur la cité
Entre drogue, alcool, baston d'ivrogne
Foye, c'est la seul place qu'on laisse à mon hip-hop

[Cheeko]
Du pe-ra dans les tubes cathodiques
Quoi, ils auraient peur qu'on dise des trucs pas très catholiques ?
Dans l'immédiat, faut du Hip-Hop dans les médias, sérieux
A force de voir des clips de merde j'vais devenir sourd des yeux

[Warlock]
Du rap à la télé ? Ma foi, mais pas n'importe lequel
Faut surtout pas que ça soit les les wacks qui mattent le game
J'veux voir du bon son, quand je zappe les chaînes
Pas de MCs comédiennes qui s'crêpent le chignon comme des collégiennes

[Wira]
J'n'allume plus ma télé car j'suis perdu dans tout ce pêle-mêle
Besoin de changement donc parlez-en à monsieur Belmer
Certains programmes me stressent autant qu'ma future belle-mère
J'me permet d'en parler car j'peux pas cautionner de telles merdes

[Artik]
Du rap sur Canal ou D8 ? Ils t'laissent espérer
Font passer mes gars pour des types genre pestiférés
Dis moi qu'est-ce qu't'y ferais toi ? des flows-syllabes ?
La plupart pensent qu'on fait rimer que "yo, zy-va"

[Namko]
Ça serait bien un jour de voir notre vraie culture sur ton écran
Rien de crade dans nos écrits alors un cri d'alerte s'impose mon grand
Gros, plein d'MCs d'talents attendent une chose c'est d'être choisis
Eh oui y'en a marre des sosies nous pondant des morceaux moisis

[Saya'B]
Pour être honnête on en a marre de vos sornettes
Mettez-nous du bon Hip-Hop à la télé et non vos soupes
Nan, nan du talent dans nos rues en soif de diffusion
Mais vos starlettes qui chantent en boucle man à l'unisson

[Nesh]
J'ai beau croiser les mots, j'ai pas ma place à "Mots croisés"
Tu fais du rap variété ? Y'a Pop Star pour faire jury
Petit appel à Yves Calvi, invite-nous je t'en supplie
Passe-nous chercher, on est bloqué de "Sept à huit" chez Harry

[Laetitia Dana]
Télé ma douce tu sais, t'as peur du H.I.P
C'est fou c'que t'as choppé à force de debats peu futés
Le marchand dans les prés XXX
C'est qu'les plumes bien aiguisées doivent deranger

[Blackapar]
Notez mon drop name, les gens d'la télé poto
Zem' ? Non, non juste Naulleau, paix à Cyril et tout sa collo...
...nel : blague de merde style Thierry Moreau
Je sors mais j'compte sur Enora pour faire la promo

[Kombo]
Y'avait du H.I.P-H.O.P à l'époque sur TF1
Les chaînes ont déserté l'chantier, dans l'R.A.P mec on est pleins
MTV, OFIVE, Trace TV j'veux plus de place pour péter l'blocus
Plus de culte pour ma zic sur France Télé et Canal +

[2ksee]
On veut du Hip-Hop à la télé, y'a plus d'Hip-Hop à la télé
J'ai un tas d'CV, pas d'CB pour t'lâcher un Track TV
Hip-Hop à la télé, y'a plus d'Hip-Hop à la télé
On attend l'retour d'Maïté pour voir quelques carottes rappées

[Barhow]
On veut du Hip-Hop à la télé, qu'ça tourne en boucle dans les médias
Dans l'immédiat te faire kiffer le rap même si tu l'aimais déjà
Et boom, ça s'rait cool qu'ça chamboule tout le petit écran
Pour faire kiffer notre culture, pour les petits et les grands

[2zer]
On viens pour dominer l'gamin avec mon Armada d'félés
On veut du rap à la télé, demande à Olivier Cachin
On envahit les ondes, assieds-toi et détends-toi
J'ammène des filles qui ont des formes même dans un écran plat

[Gizzle]
Négro, y'a quoi sur l'écran plasma ? Rien de nouveau
Pourtant, des trucs de oufs s'passe dans le rap mais on les passent pas
Tu veux du Ghetto Blaster, du hip-hop dans les iPod
Clique, clique c'est l'tour de passe-passe, tu m'verras dans ton poste

[D'Clik]
Ici on rêve qu'le rideau s'lève, qu'le hip-hop crève l'écran
Le rap innove, le PAF ignore, faut bien qu'on prenne les devants
Ouais, on nous passe pas à la télé tant qu'on représente sur l’asphalte
Ils nous traitent comme des araignées donc nous on s'répend sur la toile

[Lemdi]
On veut du hip hop au max, réalisé par Pullicino
De vrais magazines, l'époque de Sear ou Texaco
Qu'on nous redonne du power, interviews de Fabe et Hour
T'imagines Lemdi & Moax présentés par Roselmack

[Tress]
J'demande un p'tit peu plus de vue , de rap dans les médias
Immédiatement j'réclame toutes les images de la rime idéale
La France d'en bas comme toi qui trime et bave
On veut tous se voir ensemble, arrêtez-les comme crime et balle

[Lino]
Trop mat pour France Télé', trop foncé pour M6 Black
Malgrès les portes enfoncées et les blagues
Or et platine, cherche ma rage dans l'paysage musical français
Comme un mic en platine pour defoncer les barrages

[Gystère]
Sale rap, j'ai gâché ma vie, raté la tienne
T'auras jamais eu d'JT
J'aurai p't'être mieux fait d'caner aux Etats-Unis
Au bout d'un cable ou à la TNT

[Rachel Claudio]
And I've been thinking and i'm done with the thinking of blinking [blank?]
XXX on bitches who rob me, you riches [the figures?]
In fact XXX bringing back will never fade into black
Hip-hop XXX on your screen XXX

[Volodia]
Et tu zappes, et tu zappes, affalé dans le canap'
Toujours les mêmes blabla que tu mattes, les mêmes salades qu'ils nous jactent
Qui a dit qu'l'audimat, lui, ne voulait pas de rap ?
C'est à la TNT, les gars, qu'on va faire péter le cable

[Willy Wander]
Depuis Zemmour et Naulleau, les chaînes éguisent leurs couteaux
Tandis qu'la France aux fachos, attendent le dérapage de trop, oh
Rap et télévision: Rapport sous pression
Il voudrait qu'on reste muet. #Véronique Sanson

[Exnilo]
Peu d'MCs sur M6 : le canal est étroit, semble t-il
Oui je pense qu'il est tant de franchir le détroit, simple type
J'excelle, loin des strass et des Seychelles
Avant de passer à l'écran, il faut se libérer de ses chaines

[Sheryo]
Faut pas rêver, y'aura jamais d'hip-hop à la télé
Ces salopes préfèrent les émissions sur les flics zélés
Trop d'talk-show pour bobo, présenté par des homos
Cesse ça, on veut des trucs pour les prolos

[Nir.k]
Je garde des bases en vain
Je suis partisan d'aucune démarche, tu t'occupes des masses et des débats sans fin
Est-ce que la télé les pousse à la réflexion ?
Non, elle séduit le vice dont elle est l'épouse

[Yellow]
Fait nous d'la place, on a la couleur, pas du noir et blanc
Mate ma face, ouais non n'aie pas peur que je crève l'écran
Ou bien, pas d'brasser du vent mon rap prend les devants
On attend pas "Vivement dimanche" allongé sur le divan

[A2H]
Yo, mon hip-hop est là, il n'veut pas bougé
Il est pas couché, quand tu le vois tes enfants aiment bouger
Mais crois moi il sait faire le taf
Il a sa place sur le PAF, ouais il va pas t'faire de farce

[KOF]
On mate pas la télé on veut qu'la télé nous matte, man
Et trop d'rappeurs puent la merde mais ils sont dans les bacs
Et trop d'rappeurs s'appellent "chef" mais ils font cuir des pâtes
Alors diffuse nous sur le cable avant qu'on pète le cable

[Kenyon]
Ca fait longtemps qu'les portes sont fermées
Longtemps qu'ils nous on cernés, pour exister en marge faut savoir se démerder
Mais pourtant, les miens on b'soin d'lumières et d'rêver
Ammenez-les, gars, la télé et montrez-les qu'on peut s'aimer

[Sear lui même]
Ils veulent nos benefs comme des fils de vampes on est pas dans les plans
On a des places mais passe pas à l'écran malgrès les chiffres de ventes
On a la maitrise mais ces types là ils méprisent le genre
Et ça m'déprime c'est c'qui m'épuise car ça métisse les gens

[Moax]
On veut du rap sale des vrais trucs, pas d'la fiction
J'veux qu'mes partitions squattent le générique d'Ardisson
Soit, du rap sur les écrans pas leur parti d'con
Rien qu'des fouines chanceux, tout ceux qui l'ont admis l'son

[Rmk]
Encore en bal pas d'bol alertez-les
Mon quarties fédéral dans les rudes rues khoya fait qu'trainer
Ils s'attelent à chuter pseudo-gang et fashion boy de mes couilles
Pas [pene?] qu'on ne m'écoute en boucle sans passer par la télé

[Zak]
Malgré les boycotts, les vengeances on est toujours à jour
Il faut qu'on provoque des tendances, allez le dire à Mouloud Achour
Spécialiste en langue de bois, on les appelle les ébenistes
Oubli Roland Garros, j'crois qu'j'f'rais mieux d'racketter des tennis

|K-Ly]
Impitoyable comme maître d'esclave
Les médias ont ma sous-culture dans l'viseur et tente de la rendre détestable
Plus de hip-hop en télé' ferait bander les jeunes
Ferait kiffer la street et rendrait p't-être Morandini moins cheum

[L-Ogan]
Y'a plus de vérité, dans une boule magique ou une rette-ba
Selon leurs dires j'suis une racaille, même moi j'l'e savait même pas
Ça m'fédère car devant la télé j'tappe des barres des rires
Moi j'ai l'impact des rimes, et de l'information d'vant l'JT d'Derka

[Titan]
Comme tous les amateurs de hip-hop, j'veux plus de rap à la télé
Demande à A2' ou Abraham, j'suis un négro fêlé
J'suis recherché par Scully et Mulder, appelle moi E.T
J'aimerais que MC soit considéré comme B.E.T

[S.Pri noir]
Un peu de hip-hop de Paris à Memphis
On voudrait entendre plus de vrais titres en playlist
En bref, pour que tous mes gens relativisent
Mettez-nous plus de hip-hop à la TV

[Géabé]
Du rap à la télé, faudrait s'y atteler
Sans forcément avoir à se faire plus de blé qu'on est, ou rentré dans le moule imposé
On veut des moyens de diffusion sans participer
À l'abrutissement général, aujourd'hui plébiscité

|Youm]
Vas dire aux medias d'ici qu'on est les poetes des temps modernes
Que la mort de Biggie me touche autant que celle de Jean Jaures
On m'parle de sous culture franchement j'trouve ça abusé
On s'battra pour qu'cet art prenne sa place, qu'on le grave dans les musées

[Hippocampe Fou]
Elle passe ses soirées à les apaiser, ce qu'elle leur sert est pré-mâché
Les enfants d'la télé sont maternés
Elle pourrait leur offrir subversion, poésie, subtilité
Mais n'a qu'un tas de chaînes pour les immobiliser

[Aladoum]
Comme l'impression qu'nos rimes sont nées dans un corbillard
Car Michel Druker veut rien lâcher comme Paul Billard
Toujours à dénigrer le hip-hop de France
Alors qu'on pourrait faire autant d'audience que l'dernier épisode de Friends

[Dandyguel]
Faut qu'on fasse quelque chose dans l'immédiat
On voit pas assez nos gueules dans les médias
Ca tombe bien, j'recherchai du boulot
Ca paye combien pour remplacer Jean-Pierre Foucault ?

[Billie Brelok]
Eh mais oh mais c'est fini la télé ci-gît la clef sur le palier
Vos promos d'rats et d'rateliers le temps l'état [ça ras-le-pied?]
T'inquiète qu'il s'aime le rap çais-fran bientôt 30 ans qu'il donne le la
Donc vous réveillez pas maintenant vous avez déjà raté tout ça

[Heazzy]
Je pense donc je suis, mais je ne suis pas ce qu'il pense
J'ai qu'une seule direction, j'écris des phrases à double sens
Discours monocorde, les médias ont la langue pendue
Certains rappeurs ont craqués parce que percer d'vient tendu

[Pumpkin]
Le hip-hop est un art brut trainé dans la boue
Avoue, les adjectifs négatifs fleurissent dans les bouches
Le PAF taf et cliché au pif mis bout à bout
Laissez-nous l'antenne avec qu'les téléspectateurs se couchent

[Lunik]
Pas de hip-hop à la télé, sont-ils félés ?
Qui fait les ventes, fait les modes, les B.O d'leur docu' clichés ?
Me parlez pas de sous-culture
Ils crachaient sur le jazz, aujourd'hui s'astiquent dessus

[Amy]
Bonne nouvelle madame Chazal, je lis Claire dans vos yeux
Attention à la marche, nan le rap n'est pas un jeu
Hey, on n'est pas couché et c'est pour ça qu'tout l'monde en parle
Puis on trouv'ra le sommeil quand y'aura du hip-hop en prime

[Passi]
En 84, y'avait des battles sur la une
Aujourd'hui je zappe, matte ma gueule pas d'culture du bitume
Pourant ont fait les thunes, nos raps les solvables
Hip-hop soldat, nos concerts sold-out

[Still Fresh]
J'aspire à être un tueur, j'veux crever l'écran
Etre sur la une, la deux: comme l'ont fait les grands
J'veut péter les cartes qu'on m'entende l'été dans les câbles
Etre en grand dans l'journal, les jaloux vont péter un câble

[Yoshi]
Chaque jours je constate qu'on nous boycotte, tant qu'on ne fait de la pop
Vu l'peura que j'apporte, TF1 m'laisse pas passer près de la porte
J'ai tout essayer, entêté comme Antoine, mais
Le bon rap en télé est rare comme le soleil en ce mois de Mai[Intro]
All my Harlem niggas
My BK niggas back uptown baby Lennox Ave
My oyes on broadway all day uh c'mon...

[Verse 1: Cam’ron]
You love the way I rep black
Step the f back
'Fore we out the guns and chest check, Respect that
Any girl I met that, Hit that
Love the way I spit that
I don't kit kat
Push your wig back
Get you shit snatched
Get your ribs cracked
Got a frontin’ habit, kick that
Get that, Sit back
School shit skip that
Learn how to flip pack
For the big stacks
And the big act
Now I got the big gat
Click, clack, uhh
Since day one been in a ditch
Kin with a snitch
Now I'm in the pen in the mix
Friends sending me flicks
Girls sending me kicks
Been in some shit
Had to tap a chin with a fist
When the ?
Begin with a stitch
End in a kiss
So yo so I blend in the mix
Now a day don't go by I ain't been in a chick
8½ on the dope ask Dominican Rich
Winning and rich
Eating on cinnamon grits
Grinning and shit
How a nigga spin in 6
See they all see the 12
But you see me in it
TVs in it
BB [???]
Ask who it is
You see me tinted
I did drive-bys
Now I take you on top of a high rise
See if you can sky dive
I'll bring it to you at your local gymnasium
How 'bout the Palladium
Fuck it Yankees Stadium uhh
Play people, jumped up and sprayed people
I got dudes that'll jig you with a AIDS needle
You not a threat
You want it you got it bet
I'll leave your momma and your poppa wet
Nigga when I’m upset
I'll go another route
Kidnap your family make you brother eat your mother out
After I done dug her out
Needles to drug her out
Pillows to smother out
You don't give a fuck about, I'm what a thug about
I'm through with it
Your crew ain't even true with it
I see your man he's like umm nothing to do with it
I know you pack like that
But Cam why you act like that
Shut up nigga clack clack clack
Pat pat pat
Rat tat tat
Put fear 'fore envy
Nigga I'm not in fear of any
I'll leave a nigga black and blue
Like a pair of Pennys
While me and Betha
Throw fiestas
By alma queta
Chicqueta, monero, nieta
Don't ever fuck around with the Don's cheddar
See Jimmy Jones frontin' in the Jon Cletta
Or the black boots, jumpin’ out to act cool
Cars never lease 'em
Girls ? 'em
My man and his wifey want me down with the threesome
Niggas tease 'em
Bitches please 'em
When I'm out of town yo my pants gotta crease 'em
All calls valid
Never hard mallet
Dallas
Been up in your favorite star's stylist
Coward
Bite on my hoes like Marv Albert
But you should thank Un though
Coulda made you run though
Been at your front door
Gun hold for fun though

[Bridge: (Anonymous Male Voice) & Cam'ron]
(Yo, yo, yo, yo)
What's up?
(What the fuck is wrong with you?)
Fuck that it's not a game
(Yo, you ain't gotta be rhymin' for niggas like that)
Man fuck them niggas B
(Yo, you know what you do)
What?
(Tell these niggas the real deal)
Aight check it

[Verse 2: Cam’ron]
Aiyyo I'm ?, cook up the crack
Everytime you look up a gat
Got you shook up attack huh
Look in the back, nah
The guns I had put in the back
I want the hook up in check
On this work of the rap
Now I'm not saying what I like
Or what I dislike
But get the fuck out my face til' your shit's right
See baby boy I carry guns, you know the big type
The kind that might give you a 10 year fear of life
And I was just like y'all flippin' hundred pack
But nowadays I'm a owner, you a runningback
You got to understand baby I'm done with the crack
I get pure white coke from Columbian cats
Or the cocaine plan
Leave your whole brain dead
Light this herb
Don't mean to disturb
Never been to Sesame Street but I flip a big bird
And I know stealers and they not from Pittsburgh
No kids rapping or ostriches
Just kidnappings and hostages
So, y'all better obey
We shoot pro way
Mess with us no way
Now go 'head go play[Cam'Ron]
Uh, Uh Yeah
We back in the fucking building
Diplomats, Young Guru, Jim Jones, Santana, Freaky
Came in second half
Shit man, only thing we really wanna know right now is
What? Is what's really good? That's the question

[Cam'Ron]
Suicide sickness, child negligence
Homicide fingerprints, wild evidence (But what?)
But thou shall, respect me bloa, bloa
Clap, clap, pow, pow, bow down, nigga
Be in Columbus never seen Bow Wow (Nope)
We big dogs, all on the chow down
Chow, and Mr. Giles lay back
Santana locked up, get 'em out ASAP
Aight, now boy, not tonight
I where a bomb to the court like it's a ice white
I'm real ice right, still in the hood
But the question for y'all is
(DMX) What's Really Good?
(Cam) Nothing, see me on 55th, black scooped it up
A-k activated, act stupid, one did act stupid
Mac had to move it, from the hood like
(DMX) What's really good?
(Cam) I had to lay 'em down, clip him up, sprayed around
Split him up, he played the ground, leave, nine stayed around
Outlaw on the street, shot four from the three
Southpaw Portuguese (What's Really Good?)

[Hook: Cam'Ron] + (DMX)
To all my ladies, ghetto to ghetto
Heals, sneakers, slipper stilettos, hello
Diplomats are coming to your hood
And we wanna know (What's really good?)
All my niggas, block for block
Rock for rock, top for top
Top a top, stash your clocks under the hood
And niggas wanna know (What's really good?)

[Jim Jones]
Okay I admit
I mean they said I was trippin' had to re-edit the spin
44 lead when I'm spitting
Shots to the head of my victims
Big deserts we grippin' to dry out, you in the desert is slippin'
They go through extreme measures to get 'em
Them chains and them treasures the glistening
You got three hideouts, a bed in the system
My brethren I miss them
So please tell me y'all
(DMX) What's really good?
(J.Jones) Top of the drop when it's missing
MY block when it's clickin', these rocks when they glistening
(DMX) What's really good?
(J.Jones) 145th on this crunk, big 45th in my trunk
Big gouty wrists on you chumps
Mostly me and sometimes them
But mostly me, oh shit man, that's one time them
Squally, so through your set up please
And let me know if you really good
And let me know if you really hood

[Hook]

[Cam'Ron]
I like this beat, drums and bells
Remind me of bullets, bodies, guns and shells
I don't talk the verse, Polly wanna cracker
When she on the stand, you probably wanna smack her
Probably wanna clap her, end your day properly
Air the shit out like the end of State Property
No run away robber, gunner stay half of me the end I see prophecy
(DMX) What's Really Good?
I'm in the buggy mon', with the Rugby on
Air Force Ones, looking like Lucky Charms
Lotta dudes, yelling out "Fuck me, uh?"
I'll blow this bitch dog, what the fuck we on

[Juelz Santana]
It's Santana, I'm straight out the box homey
Straight to the stoop, straight to the booth when I stepped out the box homey
I still got the sun of the box on me
Grimy clothes, funky arms, my socks dirty
I told you I can count on my boy
I'm in trouble, needed bail money, dialed on my boy
Shit, and just when I thought it was getting worst
I was bailed out scot-free, spittin' this verse, uh-huh
You don't sit in the dirt, clips'll disperse
(Dmx) What's Really Good
(Santana) ME MOTHERFUCKER!!!
Don't play with this, I'm so great at this
Santana, bandana, release the eight a spit (COME ON...)

[Hook][Verse 1: KRS One]
We hit 'em and get 'em
We stick 'em and jig 'em
We pick 'em and kick 'em
Flippin' them whip and
I'm wing clippin' them lip cause I'm cold sick of them
Much quicker than them lyrically trickin and
My tribe be on a quest like Tip and them
On every avenue puttin the full clip in 'em
Splittin' and strippin' 'em down while spittin' a round
Into them soundclash see winnin' them, just begginin' them
Get rid of every bit of them with them negative idioms
I don't even consider them
In the new millenium we killin them
Breeze Deep, Kenny and Will and them, KRS-One we thrillin' 'em
Many battles we been in them now we rebuildin them
We blaze, fulfillin them, Keith ?, Jesse, Jamil and them
We originate styles, others be stealin'them

[Verse 2: Vigilante]
You got a good rise in your rolodex, who flow is next?
Comin out to fuck with the best, put it in your chest
Inhale it and hold that, blow it out when I say let go
Let's see if you can hold your breath, by the time I flip to the next flow
This show is real, this is the deal, guns I'm running
Gotta make it out of town to flip my shit and keep it coming
Then bring it back, with another stack, of raps to blow your back out
How many of y'all wanna go for yours I keep my dogs in the crackhouse

[Verse 3: Buckshot]
Let's take a walk through Crown Heights
Steppin through the city at night
With a bunch of niggas and two mics
Form a little lynch mob, and stomp through the five boroughs
Head back to Brooklyn in the Expo
Back on the block, I see the cops everybody clockin
Buckshot, when you see the rocks, me I got you shocked
Why not? You see the recipe
Buckshot, I represent Brooklyn and my nigga Biggie

[Verse 4: Keith Murray]
I'm from C-I, L-I, F-L-Y
Where the niggas and the bitches stay paid, fly and high
Where a slut'll get mad if you call her a bitch
And a rat'll get mad if you call her a snitch
Where the rich emerge, with the niggas from the ditch
And it's a myth, they get niggas from the suburbs, that's herbs
Yo, this is for my niggas on the block all day
Who don't give a fuck waiting for crime to pay
Put your money on it, yo, we never fronted
Long Island got some of the best niggas that ever done it
From Riverhead to C.I. to Brentwood to Wyndanch
Niggas coming through will not stand a chance
From Roosevelt to Freeport to Hempstead to Uniondale
Coming deep from the depths of hell
I'm dead serious, even though you see me smilin'
Rough enough to break New York from Long Island

[Verse 5: Cam'Ron]
We destroy niggas, need advice, cause I heard em sayin Jesus Christ
You should see the sight, cookin ox-tail, peas and rice
Making about a G a night, they can't read or write
But I got every creed and type
You need a dyke, babygirl, I see the light
But sometimes y'all get crimey crimey, grimy grimy
But those with a tiny hiney they get whiny whiny
So guard your girl, Harlem World, cock the gun, pop it son
Fila fam, illa players, Killa Cam is still the man

[Verse 6: Bounty Killer]
?????????????????????

[Verse 7: Killah Priest]
Yo, hit you with the force of an iron horse
Tear your face off the planet, leaving one-third damaged
With your back cracked the Earth canvas, leavin mountains slanted
Rock the Earth of the axle, crabs who
Polar bears beneath the sea gravel
Thoughts be runnin wild like the Lil' Rascals
Puttin dinosaurs inside of figure fours, rip you with nine inch claws
Chasing motherfuckers through malls, and clash in halls
Beating motherfuckers through walls, stompin through floors
And jumpin down elevator shafts
Searchin for they ass, stayin low in the grass
Wearing a gas mask, wrapping their hands up in plastic bags
On stage like a savage goin mad
What? Yeah yeah, sooooooooooooo

[Verse 8: Prodigy]
Yeah, by all means you know you gotta put Queens on it
Put cream on it, Q.B. we rep often
Take over your party, slam dance with your hood
Took your ladies back to the projects with us
Then sent her ass back on the Q-train home
Satisfied, she learned the words to my thug song
See we one big borough of Dons with firearms
And we never use those, til the man act
Other than he's 'sposed to, nigga what I'm 'sposed to do?
Shots whistle, damn near missed dat
Shoes get pissed at

[Verse 9: Redman]
From the, tip of my Timbs, to my eyebrows
The hostile, eEnglish, Olde E widemouth
Get PCP fiends, jumpin off cliffs
And if you had the balls, you'd be walkin off stiff
My paragraph alone is worth five mics (uh-huh)
A twelve song LP, that's thirty-six mics (uh-huh)
And while you win Un Hype (uh-huh) I spit on your snipe
And tell you fuck you and that bitch on your bike
Brick City

[Verse 10: Reverand Run]
Ayo, now bust it
Never try me crimey, I'm grimy, so don't deny me
I be little like your Rascals and stymie to fly that hiney
Buy me keys, to my Benz and my Coupe
Like Jay and Run and D.M.C.'s, that's the name of my group
(Now speed it up)
Beat to the rhythm of the rhyme
I'm givin up a dime, there go another line you figured
Never drivin by nine, never givin up a dime if you was
Never been that nigga
If you really wanna test me, brother don't stress me
Or you just be bowlin
It's Reverand like a Jesse, brother that's just me
And that's just my colon

[Outro: All]
The five boroughs of death, we rep to death
Step aside little niggas, show time yep
It's goin down the moment we inside the spot
Let's rock'n'roll, you know the M.O., it gets real
When the five boroughs of death, we rep to death
Step aside little niggas, show time yep
It's goin down the moment we inside the spot
Let's rock'n'roll, you know the M.O., it gets hotThis is the Vmix! How big said it
When the Rémy's in the system
Well I got a 60 clip on me
Like an AK in my pocket, bitch
Get money
Or should I say young money
Ay killa you know the rules dip set for life

[Hook: Jim Jones]
I'm all about that motherfucking paper ho
This song goes out to all my money making hoes
60 rackz in my pocket, 60 rackz in my jeans
60 rackz in my pocket, top back when I lean
I pull up in that motherfucking Phantom Ghost
This song goes out to all my niggas getting dough
60 rackz in my pocket, 60 rackz in my jeans
60 rackz in my pocket top back when I lean

[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
60 racks thats no dough, mattes fact thats ho dough
I made that when I transported, back and forth taking Nodoze
Rolex rose gold, my neck so cold
She seen't that quarter chill, V in black, quarter mill
We don't shop at saveraux, 60 thou for the roll
Drop top foreign flow, this is not affordable
Wrist cold, caught the flu, Cartier said quarter to
She sucked my dick, swallowed it, my watch still said quarter to
Dipset, Young Money, niggas know that that money grown
Wanna talk to me, you better talk to me, from that pool deck of my summer home (Can't hear you niggas)
My summer home, pool deck with like a hundred on
Who's a threat? Got a pool net, and my jewels wet like a thunderstorm

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Swear to God I go so hard, they call me Tunechi fuck 'em all
Can't pack no gun, so I keep a knife like that fuckin' Chucky doll
I'm at your neck like a shawl, on your ass like some drawers
I got 3 hoes with me, fuck, I look like Santa Claus
And I got bad bitches all over me, real niggas that roll with me
And we get off weight like that one bitch from Floetry
Got a pair of pants with 4 pockets, 15K in each of 'em
Do the math you mo'fucka, I'm on my Robin Leach, blood
Skating with my homeboys, talking shit smoking weed
I oversee everything, niggas call me overseas
Young mulah mothafucka, click clack boo ya, mothafucka
60 rackz in my pocket, try to jack and get bodied
Young Tunechi

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
I got an ill gift, I'm real swift, they be like, "Damn, he still rich"
When I send my men in black listen none of them niggas is will smith
I sell coke, I deal piff, when I ride by in that black on black
Ménage à trois with two double D's, come to see that's racks on racks
They ship it in, I give it to ya on the ground or in the air
They drop it off, they're like LeBron in the 4th quarter, I give it there
I be me, you be you, apologies to Groovie Lou
Sorry, brah, I ain't fuckin' with mase, yea yea tell 'em you be cool
Me I rep that Hud 6, I ain't even gon' play with 'em
Harlem Underworld for real, you can fool Wale and them
The MAC, well, that's black on black, true fact I'm crack on tracks
Play around, and I'll lay you down, 60 racks in your cap, nigga

[Hook]Yo
My crew is in the house
Terra, Herb McGruff, Buddah Bless
Big Twan, Killa Cam, Trooper J, and Mike Boogie
And I'mma set it like this

[Verse 1: Big L]
Aiyo, folks who quote what I wrote get choked
You better surrender before you get smoked
You niggas be thinkin this kid is a joke?
I put chumps to rest fast, when my Smith-Wes' blast
So just dash or trespass and get your chest smashed
Rap New York rules, I sport jewels and extort crews
Don't get me pissed, I got a short fuse
I go bezerk when I put in work or do dirt, jerk
So stay alert, no smirk, cause these knuckles hurt
I'm from the alley, not the valley
I'm hotter than Cali, wicked like Harry
And fuck Sally, I rather marry Halle
I revive crowds with live styles
Don't hang with jive pals
Adios, ghost, I'm 5 thous'

[Verse 2: Terra]
Well, I'm flav, and I was down with the crime wave
Now it's time saved, yo, cause now I'm a rhyme slave
In '87 I sold cracks, collected some dough stacks
Hold gats, a joker got his soul taxed
Innovated, rappers you know who made it
Tell the Terra to rotate it, his raps are gold-plated
This nigga Terra is past butter, sharp like a glass cutter
Ass brother, I leave your rhyme trash gutter
I'm more rare, the MC in this warfare
Put you in a morgue where it's too late for that Lord prayer
Power struck, Terra drops the follow-up
Sour luck, niggas got and popped and swallow nuts

[Verse 3: Herb McGruff]
For those that don't know, yo, I'm Herb McGruff
I'm on some murder stuff
And when I talk every verb is rough
Front on this and get beat bad
With big bats that bruise, break bones
Then wind up bloody in a bodybag
MC's are live, but I'm mad liver
Aiyo, my rhymes are more funky than a African cab driver
Step to this and get sliced with ease
Ate up like rice and peas
(Herb, can you fight?) Yo, I'm nice with these
Ask the nigga in my last bout
He thought I just was on some gun shit, I had to knock his ass out
Microphones I gotta tear
Peace to Big L, straight from hell
I'm the fuck up outta here

[Verse 4: Buddah Bless]
Aiyo, it's time to get drastic, but God bless the fantastic
Herb passed it, now I melt the mic like it's plastic
I rag crews cause I'm bad news
In a mad mood I'm serving brothers quicker than fast food
Step to this and get your body blown
Cause I'm no maricon, for poems I slide the hotties home
Here's some advice, I'm mad nice
Aiyo, I'm quick to lick the mag twice
And cold take a fag's life
My swellin melon got niggas jealin
Aiyo, fuck bribes, I'm takin niggas lives like a felon

[Verse 5: Big Twan]
Yo, I bust chumps like a Glock 10, when I drops in
The top ten is rocked when it's locked in
I just abuse the flow, don't need a fuse to blow
Bruise the groove slow, when I rhyme I just kill the show
I got lines that's deeper than a jail
Been no frail, kids get nailed and read braille when they fail
Yeah, ain't I nasty, too nasty to trash me
Bash me, aiyo, that's dead, so don't ask me
You'd get bumped off if beef ever jumped off
I never come soft, I gotta pump that sawed-off
And when I let slugs out, you will get rugged out
For dissin, you come up missing like a cub scout

[Verse 6: Killa Kam - Cam'Ron]
Rappers be funny like Flex, cause they section's 80 slaughter, son
Talk about nines and tecs, and never shot a watergun
But Killa Kam, I get erratic when it comes to static
There you have it, a trigger fanatic with a automatic
Increase the peace that cease cause once I release
My crew from the east, we leavin at least
20 police deceased, it's the beast on attack
So make tracks, I break backs
I jack with def gats and black macs
On Lenox Ave. ain't no light looks, you fight crooks
Left and right hooks, if you front, get your life took

[Verse 7: Trooper J]
I'm havin nail-sharp pains in my brain like a hellraiser
I'm blazin trails from jail cells, so a trailblazer
Who find crime and fill the nine with nothin but lead
Boom-bye-bye, dem find another batty bwoy dead
In backyard alleys, but I call em crackyard valleys
And I pack more rallies than riots back in Cali
And people wanna know the reason why I blow my fuse
I'm in a daze and I'm so confused
From seein heads shake so many times the lead make
And Mike Boogie's next up, and keep my head straight

[Verse 8: Mike Boogie]
I should never rhyme cause every time I step into a contest
Kids evacuate the premises like it's a bomb threat
Cause they know when I start droppin' poems
That I be knockin' domes, poppin' bones and sendin' niggas hoppin' home
Word to God, it's kinda hard for a fag to touch this
So if you're come to see me, nigga, bring a cast and crutches
And niggas, I dont' need a gun for you, none of you
Cause I can kill you dead with the lead from my Number 2
And it's death in every paragraph
And niggas learn when I burn their muthafuckin' ass to ash
No need to question am I nice, cause it's a fact, friend
I shoot the gift like Santa Claus with a Mac-10
And niggas ain't half as nice, so they get sacrificed
And sent to the afterlife, they ain't no match for Mike
Now I'm bout to skate in a rush, just finished makin' it tough
Peace to Big L, ayo, 8 is enough

[Outro: Big L]
True, true
And before I get up outta here
I gotta say peace to D-Whiz and Short Man
Brothers that was there since the beginning
What's up to Rock-N-Will from the Hard Pack Crew
Peace to Mase Murder and the B.B.O. Crew
The Best Out Crew, the M&M Crew
And all the other crews that's representin in Harlem
You know what I'm sayin?
And last but not least
I gotta say peace to the 139th Street NFL Crew
My crew
Word up[Cam'ron]
Killa, Psycho Drama, Twista, Chi-Town to Harlem what's really good?

[Yung Buk of Psycho Drama and Twista]
Part 2, What happens, when you combine the darkness, with the light?

[Verse 1: Yung Buk of Psycho Drama]
Yeah, I am more than compelled and honored to expel
This hell that's inside of my shell for fuckers who want it
Violence, yeah that bullshit right up my alley, chasing you right up the alley
With a gun fixin' to kill you cuz I feel you was the one fuckin' with my family
I roll wit a gang of go-getters, and them ghouls and them gorillas
Who be quick to put the Glock or the gauge to the gut of one of your niggas and pull it
The trigga and deliver you niggas these rigorous bullets
It's so riveting to see you livin' in vengance sit up and shrivel to pudding
Fuckin' wit niggas you shouldn't, these menaces and villians and hoodlums
That'll give you the business and in an instant be dimishin' whoopin'
Cuz it ain't no type of jokin' or jivin' comin' off of this
You done sommersaulted and dived in a coffin of shit
So if you ever get the notion to just motion forward and get on some ho shit
You niggas remember that I got that potion
To bore your brain in a bag and give you a new perspective on who the realest y'all
You just can't kill one you stupid bitch, you got to kill us all

[Hook - 2x]
(It's your adrenaline rushhhhh)
Like when the motherfucka have to go and pick up the pump
To make his opposition chest kick up and jump
When you lit up the gun, to make ya body get up and uhh
(It's your adrenaline rushhhhh)
Like when the motherfucka have to go and pick up the pump
To make the trigga pick up and dump
So turn the bass kick up the bump, and let the rhythm hit off the trunk

[Verse 2: Twista]
What can I say to make you see how the fuck I feel
To make me wanna run up in ya home
Shoot you in the dome, if you bustin' my body up wit the chrome
I stilla be in the zone like Capone
Better leave me alone, cuz I represent the city known for killin' motherfuckas
Makin' plenty money and layin' mack down
Cam buckin' Twista spittin' gritty competition what a pity
You ain't fuckin' wit it then put ya stash down
Come at the family you touched uh, I'll shoot up ya V-12 even if you wit ya female uh
You was talkin' shit nigga wassup, fuckin' up ya Sprewell's and ya new interior detail
And a nigga standin' too tall to fall, comin' so I hope y'all can crawl
Bloody up the vest all the wall
Sacrifice my body screamin' Kamakaze, I can take all of y'all

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
Y'all niggas play around, guns I wave around
Nigga better stay down, lay down, weigh pounds
Put 'em on the Greyhound, ride it up to K-Town (Chi-Town)
The boy get nasty, Tell law enforcement blast me
Sawed-off and I'm happy, or where the crack be
Put it right off of Pulaski
Cross street, don't need to be said
Code red I already got beef with the feds
Put three in ya head, from the street full of lead
Fuck knee-deep you'll be six feet when ya dead
Street sweeper when I creep creep, nigga fled(Flii-Flii)
When ya sleep sleep, nigga dead
Why you on the back block, fightin' in the crack spot
Jackpot, ask not yes why not

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Cam'ron]
Ya bitch is a ho, she chill at the Rucker, you really a sucka
Big Will tryin' to grill her and cuff her
And Killa done fucked her, in love wit the chick, the slut was a fish
Threw her bait, reeled her in and gutted the bitch
And now she, up in Pokip's dick, huggin' the strip slick
5th tucked in her hip, she will mug you for kicks
And word to mother I'm rich, hit ya mother with bricks
Cocoa why don't ya build buildings with concussion the bitch

[Verse 5: Twista]
Come and feel wit the balla who's the nicest and causin' the crisis
Got the ammo and agility that says rewind means growin' before
And this livin' and pause and this likeness
I can spit it for some who for nigga represent the call of the righteous
Or gang bang to the rhythm when I spit it
I'mma kill 'em wit the technical precision that'll be fuckin' up all the devices
Get sick wit it like I'm lit off the wet, if it's beef, get the shit off ya chest
Don't take off ya vest, all my niggas make you jump off the set
And always get the prints of the tech, straight off the deck
Mobbin' up and makin' niggas duck, knowin' I'll still open up the trunk
Guns nigga we get 'em and bust
Murderin' the enemy is the ultimate adrenaline rush

[Hook - 2x][Intro][Cam'Ron]
Killa

Dipset in the building (yes, sir)
Let's get ready to do this shit, Yo

[Verse One] Cam'Ron
Call me the better man
Beretta man, leather man, cheddar man

I tell you where the high is and where the low at
When it gonna rain dog where the snow at
And where the snow at it ain't got to cold at
My block is hot kojak got his Kodak
And that's totally wack
Y'all supposed to be cats
Men of mice of course they go grow to be rats
That's ain't Cam's momento so I crammed the rental
With grams and endo had them saying Jusendo

Fuck the long arm of the law he's strong on sckrilla

[Verse Two][Lil' Flip]

I wish you would come to my neck of the woods
Come to my hood
Better bring a tek to my hood
And we be buccin' and drivin'
While you shuckin' and jivin'
Niggas hateful low down dirty plus they conivin'
Me and my niggas we roll with triggers
We kill you for figures
We put 13 bricks in the 18 wheeler (yeah)

[Hook X4][Lil' Flip]
Street life is all I know
So when I carve my music that's all I show

[Verse Three][Lil' Flip]
All I know is nigga bring me all my dough
Cause rap money come fast and [?] money come slow
One day you on yo feet the next day you flat broke
That's the drought cause yo connect got bad dough
Now you got smoke from another nigga you don't know
That nigga might be a fed if he don't show
Plus plots and skeems
Young niggas chasing green
You better wake up cause ya'll niggas chasing dreams

Hook[Chickens clucking in background]

All the chickens go cluck, cluck, cluck [repeats throughout song]
When I come through
All the chickens go cluck, cluck, cluck
When I drive through
All the chickens go cluck, when I
All the chickens go cluck, when I
All the chickens go cluck, when I, yo, yo

[Cam'ron]
I'm that one cat that the hood be lovin
They way I floss, y'all chickens, should be cluckin
One bird chirp, got blunt wit me
She work up at Starbuck, front on me
I said chill baby girl, you a real dirty chick
Fucked up bad, real, real, thirsty chick
You just chop, called you karate chick
Fuck with me, I make you somebody bitch
Like your sister, she was just a crack chick
Now heads turn, yo, yo who dat bitch?
Like Cam is a son of a bitch
That'll tell a girl, ma, wash under your tits
But I, got a girl, we all call her "Licka"
Cuz she drink liquor, let another girl lick her
If you licky, licky, we all could play
But I don't eat nothing that can walk away, Killa

[Chickens clucking]

When I come through...
When I drive through...
Uh, one mo', when my jewelry shine...
All the chickens go, all the chickens go, all the chickens go...

[Juelz]
Now if you been to the hood, you dealt wit a chicken before
And you know that they different than whores
Same rules, never put your dick in 'em raw
But a chicken you could have out, pitchin 'em raw
Cuz she listen, been through it, did it before
But you gotta watch 'em close cuz they blab they mouth
Never punch 'em in they face just slap they mouth
Then fuck her til she cluck her whole basket out
Send her home wit her ass ripped out, and her back hurtin'
She wanna act like she don't know why her back hurtin'
Cab fare no, hope your train pass workin'
Hope you got a metro card or a token
They all love sayin if you lickin you stickin
But just cuz I eat chicken don't mean I eat chickens
And they love when I don't stop, keep diggin
Make 'em wanna cluck more, make 'em wanna fuck more

[Chickens still clucking]

Uh, uh, Killa, uh, uh, what, uh
When I come through...
Oh, uh, what, uh, when I drive through...
Uh, uh, uh, when my jewels shine...
All the chickens, all the chickens, all the chickens

[Cam'ron]
Ayo one time came through, grabbed me a chicken
Took L advice, slap me a chicken
But my girl don't need no type of brains
Just get down, gimme some type of brains
And I'm never gonna have no damn wife to claim
But if your head right I might ice your chain

[Juelz]
It's a shame how y'all chicks admire the jewels
Niggas wearin white gold y'all inspired them fools
But I'mma tell you chicks once
Only thing you gon' get from Juelz is dick and some big blunts
And if you don't smoke guess it's just dick
But don't worry baby it's about this thick

[Chickens continue]

Uh, when I come through...
Yo, it's like you know, if my watch is $50,000...
My chain is $45,000...
My pinky ring is $25,000...
The year of my car, match the year that it is
What you expect a chicken to fuckin do?
Y'all doin the right thing ma keep cluckin
Cuz I'mma keep shinin, keep cluckin
Uh, when I come through...
When I drive through...

[Cluck to the end](Always made it)

[Hook: Vado:][Verse 1 - McGruff]
Crooked corrupted criminal crime boss with cream
Cocaine hustler, blowing out the brains of busters
Be in my mansion chillin', inhalin' the ganja smoke
Counting mad cream, weighin' tons of coke
Guarded by thugs and Rottweilers
I flood the streets with drugs and clock dollars
Niggas get plugged when my Glock hollers
Skunk smokers, Philly and Owl ripper
Cristal sipper, I've been a willy for a while nigga
'Gruff got hoes, the man with all the nachos
Expensive hot clothes, drop top Rolls
East coast, West coast, fiends overdose
'Gruff get the cream with my team and I'm ghost

[Verse 2 - Ma$e]
This money be temptin' me, to jump out the MPV
Empty three clips of hollow tips with no sympathy
Since 14, I sold morphine for more green
Kept open a Nautica coat under the drawsting
And watched out for cops, squad cars, and Beemers
And laundry ninas, flee the country to Argentina
Laid back in the beach (yeah) coastin' with commuters
Smokin' the buddahs on the cruiseline boat to Aruba
For a while, yo; pump the vowel so I can pile dough
Then become a Harlem kingpin just like Alpo'
Get paid so I can lay low in San Diego
With yayo so I can ship it out whenever I say so

[Hook]
Yo! Makin' this money is the American Dream
East Coast to West Coast, you know what I mean
Whether it's Uptown, Downtown; you pick the scene
You gots to get your own scheme
We ain't splittin' this cream

[Verse 3 - Cam'ron]
Yo! I'mma run hystrically, till they bury me
Count numerically,hills of Beverly
More grands than cherokee; president like Eric B., and Rakim
Drug game, I'm top ten; locked in? Right now its not an option
And those who creep got the Mac in the heat
They got the five-inch screens in the back of the seat
And now they got this daddy raggin'
Last year, had me saggin', wasn't ready
When Heavy was back, tossed me in the paddywagon
But ain't nobody out here stoppin' love
Cause we was twelve years old in the Cotton Club, poppin' bub'
So all the fame without the fortune; goddamn, you wrong
Killa kid Cam-e-ron surviving in the Amazon

[Verse 4 - BloodShed]
Yo! I leave you dazed and froze
With all kinds of amazing flows
Money surrounded I counted
While bathing with Asian hoes
Back home niggas is after me
I'm back to sea, sippin' daquiris
Coke factory, fiends baggin' up crack for me
From cutting up rocks to investing in stocks
Nautica yachts, and knots busting outta my socks
Now that Bloods play the chub
All the ladies love me, they hate who made me hubby
Behind my back they say my baby's ugly
Each night I sleep, with freaks with Lamborghini jeeps
Neighbors be sneaking peeks, how my semen leaks, between the sheets
Mess up my loot, I cut your collars, Juan
Cause these is modern times, and the only thing I see is dollar signs

[Hook]

[Verse 5 - Big L]
Check it! To be seen clean in the mean Beam
Is every team's dream; Big L's a cream fiend

Harlem kids is known for felonies
And sellin' keys, pushin 300Z's

And keep a pocket full of centuries
Ayo, I'm set for the rest of my life
Some clown that laid the threat cause I had sex with his wife

Dropping though these eight flights
Hold my blade tight, forced to do wrong to make right
Now they got this daddy braggin'
But last year had me saggin'
Wasn't ready when Teddy was baggin'
Tossed me in the paddy wagon
And life's an obstacle, often I just stop and pull
Brothas like to act, that's why I make sure that the Glock is full
Reporters shootin' photos of Killa shootin' the Glock, I'm loco
Drinkin' vodka dolo, sellin' yayo in Acapulco
So all the fame without the fortune, goddamn you wrong

No movie but I bought out that 2012
"Hey girl" she ignored me, I'm like "Honey, hell"
What up money? I'm Cam, but I know money well
Sniff me, that money smell, cologne juke
Chrome coupe, before towns Killa had his own stoops
Now I'm shaving coke on an amazing boat
Fuck you, suck dick
I don't know what to say to folks..
Sick chain, from the 6 train
Took the 5th lane, where I get brain
Yeah, get brain, shit mane
I blow past em
Can't hear y'all niggas
Closed caption
Been places, spent faces
Y'all big babies, blame Davis
You ain't that one team
So come dream, Bruce Leroy glow
Y'all need sunscreen

[Hook - Vado]
American greed shit'll turn you
Into the worst type
Lock like Madoff, die like Kirk Wright
You'll get more dirty when
Your collar and shirt white
Carry our dreams, Rose wishes
The thirst life
I'm fire, you burn
Backstreet Boy *NSYNC like Lou Perlman
I'm the 6th member as long as the crew earn
Half the crew earnings, I take my break

[Verse 2 - Vado]
Sosa wars I'm feeling like Big, Harlem we back son
On stage, boxers and Timbs
Holding my plaque up
Beat knocking, red put that track up
Move 8-balls, play pool? Well nigga rack up
Hit the white with all soda
Terrorizing the streets in the Viper or Cobra
New Louis Vuitton sneaks with spikes all over
Crib on some kid shit, my Nikes all over
Small purchase, next time I'll re-bigger
Fitted low dark shades like I don't see niggas
Getting dough like I don't need niggas
Didn't know that crime pays?
Well look at Flea nigga!
Fortune 500, we read niggas
Wall Street Journals and several
American Greed niggas
Lot of dough to be made, shit
I agree, nigga
Summertime, True Religion jeans
Is capris nigga

[Hook - Vado]

[Verse 3 - Vado]
Julius Earving whip her: I'm a 6er
Rucker Park mixer, with the rock I fix ya
Ball at Bar Mitzvahs, miss is off the Richter
Ricky Ricardo laugh at ya
Get your chicks up
Chips up, I got a full house
Ferrari, Porsche, I leave chicks
With a full mouth. Ouch
Cage open: who let the bull out?
I'm good out, violence and drugs
I'm what the hood about

[Cam'ron]
Vado got a vision that's so raw
Say no more. Rewind: he remind me of me in '04
Maybe it's our habitat, maddest clap
Rat-tat-tat, I had to trap, imagine that
Lenox Ave graduate in fact
And if you seen me in the Louis
With the crew blowing Oowee
Right hand should salute me
Look here, you Sam Bowie
Scram, Scoobie
Tan Gucci, play your part
Scary Movie

[Hook - Vado][Hook] [Jermaine Dupri]
Ayyo a Pimps a Pimp
Flow is flow
Doe is do
Ho's a ho
Chic's a chic
Trick's a trick
Bitch a bitch across the world
So, nigga, getcha money and attend to your girl

[Cam'ron]
Now when it comes to these hoes I did'em I got'em
Rip'em and rock'em
But if I hit'em I pop'em
But if I lick'em I lock'em
And I ain't famous at all
Let my game tell it all
But they a pain in my balls
Got to train'em like dogs
From how they, walk and they talk and when they sit on the couch
To how they, lick in they mouth and never shit in the house
But I make ladies wit babies, let the street drive em crazy
They say "Cam, good you saved me" Now I pimp em and they pay me
They feelin' it like Jay-Z, on Sugar Hill like AZ
Went _Party Time_ like Tray Lee, I'm SoSoDef like J.D
Oh baby they have you stressed, nigga
Mad depressed
I want they mind...Muthafucka, you could have the rest
Cause I gas'em up, I tell them I'm more than just the lover
I want to be your friend, father, confidant and brother
See my, nine-inch slugger now she, chose her devotion
With messing with my money, girl you messing with my emotion

Chorus x 1

Now baby-cakes what's you're name?
(Ain't no need to explain)
Why is that?
(Cause I'm from Down South)
Well I got Down South game
And to mess wit' you this my last attempt
Cause I only like when you're ass is bent
So damn dumb you ain't stash a cent
You ain't know I get cash to pimp
Go ask him, my whores are fresh
Hardcore to death, 'xplore the rest
Tell you now backdoor's the best
For the stress
We never raw in flesh
Why I'm sores aguess (?)
I get paper, yeah I stack them chips
Condoms when I grab them hips
Kiss and mix you wrap them lips
And if she act (smack the bitch)
If she wack (smack the bitch)
Sad to see the way it had to be
Mack the bitch the bitch don't mack me
Cubic snappy but so are mine, know my rhymes
Yo, my rhymes got a concubine
Cause I control they mind
Avoid the crew
'void the groove
Got more doe, than the fued
Got more hoes, than the few
If I die they wouldn't know what to do
Whatcha think all they do is cry?
Tell you this between you and I
Forty slit wrists outta the forty nine suicide

Chorus x 1

And now I'm drunk of the Henny now, went off the Remi now
Niggas always envy now cause I'm good and plenty now
And when it come to gettin' head, yo many bow
Girls acting friendly now (Killa cum up in me OWW)
I leave em past leaking
Last weekend, I took Cardan to get his ass eaten
He said you past freakin but I'mma ace so throw your cards up
But if you stink baby, I ain't hard up
Hard luck to wash up, but that's insulting, revolting
But if you clean we ballin, eat you til you catch convulsions
And girls all fiend, for the bodm on my team and my mob
Think we scheme and we rob the way they screamin' for God
And all sluts wit the V's, let em see how it be
They be like "No, you ain't puttin all that meat up in me"
You whylin out, for the styinout
Girls say I'm foul and doubt
But baby got to understand
That's what my style's bout

Chorus x 2

Ayyo a Pimp's a pimpYo, yeah, this is the Rocafella remix
Killer-Cam, Nappy Roots, y'all ready?

Awnaw! Hell naw! Boy
Y'all done up and done it
Awnaw! Hell naw! Boy
Y'all done up and done it
Awnaw! Hell naw! Boy
Y'all done up and done it
Ah, y'all done up and done it
Man y'all done up and done it

[Fish Scales]
My first song was like forty-eight bars with no hooks
You hear me flippin thru my pages out my favorite notebooks
The microphone was in the closet, no headphones, we lost it
Niggas scared to get some water, roaches hangin over the faucets
No AC, Tez'll break a sweat just tryin to make beats
E-Dubz was being a hustler
Always flirtin with all his customers, and flat broke
Nappy smokin blacks out on the back po'ch
I'm thinkin I got everything a country boy could ask for

[Big V]
Now what we do to get here? (say that boy)
Lay it down and bring it to ya raw (say that boy)
Hey now we hurt some, suffered for more, takes what we work for
Hated for for the cussin, but the hatred it made us cuss more
Held on, but it was hard, stepped up, took charge
Ran through what we scared of, but what was we afraid for?
Look at what we made of, hard times done made us
Being here is alright, but must believe we want more!

[Jazze Pha]
Them country boys on the rise
With them big fat wheels on the side
Peep them vertical grills on the ride
And awww-aw-aww-aw
Them country boys
With them big fat wheels
Peep the vertical grills
And awwwww

[Skinny DeVille]
My yegga, we hogwild, bet that from that roota to that toota file
Hell naw, them country boys ain't headed south for six miles
Kentucky mud, them kinfolk, twankies with them hundred spokes
Skullied on that front porch, plus you know they got dro
Seventy-nine coupe DeVille vertical Caddy grill
Interstate 65 heading down to Cashville
Glass filled, to the tippy top, back seat Benz
Spent my last cent on the rent, left with pocket lints
A damn shame, gotta grind anything and everything
Jimmy Crack Corn, cross the county line with Mary Jane
A long time, a gravel road, to cash and fame and sold my soul
To Hell and back, and back and forth, with same jeans and nappy 'fro

[R. Prophit]
I might, hop off the Harley, smoke mine like Bob Marley
Block parties with shawties, wallin like they swallowin Bacardi
Them butter-skin, Prophit gutter like kin
Understand you 'bout to lose ya life fuckin with them

[Jazze Pha]
Them country boys on the rise
With them big fat wheels on the side
Peep them vertical grills on the ride
And awww-aw-aww-aw
Them country boys
With them big fat wheels
Peep the vertical grills
And awwwww

[Cam'Ron]
Killer, uh, when it come to New York
I'm the man around town, just trust me
Down in the buggy, I that cat down in Kentucky
Outta Bowling Green, heard ya holding cream
Mess with a city slicker, we could mould the team
We'll talk in code, smoker be the sandbox
Could be the ham hocks, or be the lamb chops
We'll make wild mills, how ill
I'll show you how that denial feel, trade in that cow grill

[Twista]
Finna head south, get up out the city
Smokin' on a fifty, feelin' pretty good
With a hood chick, gotta hit a little bit
Now she call me daddy in a caddy full of wood
Call me country, TV's on the headrest
Even if there ain't no seats in the back of me
I play the DVD's, for the cars on the streets
And the people in back of me
I'm trailin', a chevy with a grill or the black cadillac, got the option
If it ain't got rims when the drop on the block with no locks than it's not my concoction
Hurt 'em with the chrome, rollin' on chrome rims it's the twenties
This Nappy Roots and Twista, if it ain't dope then don't call it country

[Jazze Pha]
Them country boys on the rise!
With them big fat wheels on the side!
Peep the vertical grills on the ride!
And aw-awww-awww-awwwww!
Them country boys
With them big fat wheels
Peep the vertical grills
And awwwwwwww![Intro]
N.O.R.E the movie coming soon
Timbaland, shut the fuck up
Tryna be out in '98, you know
I'm tryna watch this movie, this the real shit
Shut the fuck up, '98, it's ours

[Verse 1: Nature]
Regardless of rain or snow, sleet or hail
I kick street tales, choking niggas like I'm Sprewell
Golden State, holding your fate in the palm of my hand
Blow you away like it's part of the plan
I gotta call it like I see it, talk it like I be it
Walking my walk, thugged out orthopedic
Cause I'm soon to be up, give me room watch me heat up
Niggas try to stick me like Abdul Louima
Follow the leader, make me go extra hard
Yo N.O.R.E. should I hold back or show the repertoire
Quit at sixteen or throw in extra bars just for the non-believers
I show them why it's so hard to reach us
I get pussy with my father's features, puff heavily
See me at 6'1", weigh a buck 70
Catch me in spots y'all niggas never be
Packed in like Green Bay, Harlem week to Queens day
Performing acapella, no DJ
'98 Live, no replays, make it seem easy
So tell a friend to tell a friend
That it's them again, Nature, Noreaga, wild gremlins

[Verse 2: Big Pun]
Champagne on the rocks, sporting a Fort Knox Lazarus
Shark salad with carrots, pork chops and applesauce
Twin connection, disrespect watch your body cave in
Pump the shotty guaging, hit the shorty while he potty training
I ain't playing, I'm truly the worst
You'll be the first to get his whole body fully reversed
Uzi ya hearse, leave you double-dead, I'm a bubble-head
I never listen to nothing my mother said
I hold niggas ransom for money like Johnny Handsome
Been soning niggas for so long, I think I got a grandson
My passion is money, a stash and a honey
That won't ask questions but will blast anybody
That's my kind of girl, kind of world I want to live in
Not a cell or a prison or in Hell's Armageddon
Just a little ghetto where my niggas control the middle
We know the riddles of life where others know only a little

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
Been in rich places, sick places
Seen my story, 6,666 pages
Wages, I rolled six aces and at the same dice games
I caught six cases, all over big faces
Now it's tipped laces, ready to dig faces
But the banger ain't a bit spacious
Niggas loading up their rib cages, cats to rent rib places
Bloody lip taste it, but Cam is a big racist
But I stay in import the pig places
But the world know the girl though, I fuck her off a furlough
She'll be up, hook me up, all your sales could be luck
Only question for these ducks is, "Baby girl could we fuck?"
You the type that need a wife
Thought L-O-X told y'all the key to life, asshole
Yo I don't play around, I lay it down, fuck around, I spray a round
Flick a biscuit, nigga risk it, my ass you can kick or kiss it

[Verse 4: Jadakiss (Styles P)]
Ain't no niggas in the world more thorough than this
Bust off and sit the hot barrel dead on your lips
Like two thirds of a brick, (Paniero) and 'Kiss
The kiss the crystal white fluffy part that'll (come back quick
(See the plan is to stash all) and cash y'all
(The weed so strong), they gotta put it glass jars
Niggas try to smoke me out the (moke me out)
Cause the rims on my new joint be poking out
(I'm about to have no feelings, shit is deep)
Do they dance with the Devil when they sleep
(I wake up gripping the air, wishing to hear)
Shit that they kick in your ear when your soul drift in the air
(My gift is half-rotten when I'm spitting some tears
That shit'll drop down my eye, I'm too tired to cry)
And I ain't never seen a nigga that too live to die
(They say you get what you ask for) So get it cause you asked for it
(If a nigga ain't a thief) then he better have the cash for it
(And we gonna be around till ya body rot)
And if the Feds bring us in we get the same time Gotti got nigga

[Verse 5: Noreaga]
There's two ways into the hood, one plain
The other smoke chronic like straight to the brain
Let's get loose, Hennessy straight with tomato juice
Queens stallion, my guns, fully Italian
Now y'all niggas recognize medallions
I play the best hood, O-T with Tim Westwood
Used to be on Section 8, now my section is good
Thugged out niggas, we eat as much as we could
And I don't give a fuck what, yo I save my shit
And I don't give a fuck what, you can save your shit
Y'all niggas like extra skin on my dick
Listen to Bob Marley, y'all funny niggas like Steve Harvey
Fronting live with a weak army
I play the nice guy too and even smoke with you
But the realness, I ain't got no love for you
That's why I never do a song with you
Not even if your baby moms fucked the crew
And promised to give us head and swallow too
I still say low, no is no, no can do
Ya niggas drinking Haterade, drinking my flow

[Outro: Noreaga]
Yo, thug shit thug shit what what
What the fuck is the deal, thugged out entertainment
Untertainment
L-o-x, Terror Squad, this shit is fuckin' official[Verse 1: Avian]
I need a pretty raw chick like Rihanna
Touch a bitch for the first time like Madonna
Strap it on the bass like Gaga
You didn't have it, girl, but I'mma put it on you

I want a ménage with Nicki
Be a slave with Britney
Make Alicia hear that slow long up here

[Chorus: Avian]
I need a billboard bitch
And I'mma make you famous
I need a billboard bitch
And I'mma make you famous
I need a billboard bitch
And I'mma make you famous
I need a billboard bitch
And I'mma make you famous
Put that platinum pussy on it
And I'mma make you famous

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
I need a billboard bitch
Man, I had a few of those hoes
Guess what? I'm still bored, bitch
You still a broad bitch
I hit it from the back, I tell her sing my chorus
Yes, I put on that side not, yes sire
And I quote, she ride the beat then ride today
Oh, shit, she hit that high note
That billboard chick's on the block where I sell keys
I done named names, check the credits on my LVs

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Jim Jones]
With a ratchet or a billboard bitch
They all just want this real good dick
I'm bait, I reel them in like fish
Big pimp, oh, she taste like shrimp
All I do is hit, I never miss
Fucked her so good she left a Tip
Front, back, side, I hit all spots
But like the billboard, I love her on top

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Juelz Santana]
Britney or Estelle, hit me on my cell
I don't discriminate, I put that dick up in the jail
Catch me with Keyshia, I tell you how I sex her
In my drop top Ferrari, call it mustard back ketchup
And tell Rihanna I will call her off a nanny
Fuck her from the back while she holding all the Grammies
With Nicki a ménage, if it's me, her and [?]
Or catch me daydreaming about JLo and her body

[Verse 5: Avian]
Oh, you about to be a star
Coming for you quick, girl
You're top ten or better
Oh, make you known around the world
I know you're a sexy girl
Let's take it to another level

[Chorus][Hook - J.R. Writer]
To all my hustlers, rock smugglers, strugglers
Block bubblers, pushers, cookers, pot jugglers
Whats the word y'all, flip that herb, raw
Clap...that's the byrd call

If the cops are coming, get to hop and running
Quick and drop that onion -- ain't no stopping, young'un
Put away that herb, raw, let us know the word or
Clap...that's the byrd call

[Verse 1 - J.R. Writer]
I still be where the weed flip, in the P's with the trees lit
So much water in the order, it's just leaving them seasick
With a ski in my V6, trying to skeet on a b lips
Down low, like I'm trying to keep her a secret
Act wrong, chrome, passing me dome
Next minute -- shit, I'm finished; she'll be flagging it home
But I always keep a straggler that's known to bone
And run through a lap faster than Marion Jones
Man listen, I still got them grams flipping, tan pitching
Corner to the damn kitchen
Gained a couple fans, had to make a transition
But I'm still in the hood like a transmission
No cat can match me, I'm passing fastly -- who's half as nasty?
I got it locked from here all the way to Cak-a-lacky
But keep a Mac for Scrappy, thinking its just laffy taffy
Shit, this beat'll be the only thing clapping at me

[Hook]

[Verse 2- Lil' Wayne]
Birdman J.R. and J.R. -- pigeons know who they are
Niggas gotta pay off
Snitches know to say y'all
If chickens on the radar, I’m at it
Cause I get it on my day off, ain't nothing like getting weight off
Scrape off the plates, shake off the flakes
Bad daddy make all the cake
I gotta lay off, the way y'all hate me like I’m Adolf
But y'all can't see me: Ray Charles
I steal whores
I’ll probably take yours
Because you peel off and I take off
Give me no space; whatever I want I takes
Whatever I need I bleed and succeed
Bitch nigga, don’t breathe on the weed
I’m fucking with them birds
Without feeding them seeds, that’s creed -- you don’t know about it
Full clip how I go about it, full body
Hard body, I’m like "God got 'im"

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Cam'ron]
"Damn, homie
In high school you was the man, homie"
That's what a fan told me, shit
Same old cat, get his Kangol clapped
Brains blown back; dissing Dame, Dame don't rap
Shame on black, the game's so whack
Dame sonned you children
From in front of your building right to a hundred million
G'head pimp it, pimping; g'head act up, doggy
Get your limp on, pimping; if they acting froggy
Tell 'em back up off me; I come down, clap the forty cal
That's a badder story, not in my category
Mess around, Dame held Def Jam down
Pardon my back, jacking and the left hand pounds
Redneck found, Tec Tec pound
Duck duck goose, pump pump shoot
Shoot, lets get down
It may seem petty, but we all turn mean deadly
For green-fetti -- my whole team ready

[Hook]

[Verse 4 - J.R. Writer]
This ain't only bars and tracks, this is for the hardest cats
Flipping all the hard in back, make them catch a heart attack
When you see the narcs attack, let me know -- start to clap, clap, clap
A star with a deal, Chopard be on chill
The car is DeVille
It's real ill, heart in the grill
It's foreign, my nills
Cruise the city with the semi or the celly
On skinnies like I'm starving my wheels[Cam'Ron]
Harlem, more than average
Niggas selling tablets for cabbage
The habbits more lavage the savage
Inside the Land rental, y'all know what y'all ran into
Cam's mental, broke this man's dental
Up in Grand Central, we sell cracks for cash makes no difference
Moving coke by the shipments, cause Digga need this equiptment
I stole grams from a foes land, make sure my doughs ran
Bitch I never hold hands, time waits for no man
5-0 not fond of me, cause I'm onerary, they honor me
What the wanna see, racketeering, and laundering
Now I got the E from jake, me and Blood deceased the fake
Man you should've seen some bake, drive out the 318
It was no hypnosis, just a few witnesses
But they'll mind their businesses cause they know who shit this is
Ands went ? with kis, but don't even mind the Ds
Smoke to keep my mind at ease, but know when it's time to squeeze
Never hurry, bullets flurry, got my own mother worried
Coming up to me with her vision blurry
She said "Cam, I know you stole for the bread
But I'm scared you'll wear a sheet with a hole in your head"
Just hold the dough cause when I perish
You'll be passed Mount Everest, sippin Mo on your terrace
Cause that's how it go when you dealing with a strangler
Girls, the misters, and haters, fellons biscuits and bangers

[Hook]
They got luccis, they got doozies
They got fluzzis shooting uzis
They got lawyers, and they doctors
Plus the coppers chasing robbers
For the cheese grab your heat
Cause there's trouble in the street
For the girls they all hate, for the fellas, biscuits and bangers

[Bloodshed]
I used to sell rocks, avoided cellblocks
Wearing shell tops, shell shocked, sells for 12 blocks
Cause niggas bell hops yo, cause I reside inside a rough place
Not even a thug safe, fuck around y'all wind up with your mug laced
I wind up in a gun chase, victim of the drug lace
I had to plug a guy in cause he said I sold his little son base
I got the cash, ask the fiends, can't pass up
I'm past bad luck, they mad stuck
Quick fast to blast they ass, what?
You best to come deep homes, cause Blood got the streets sown
Front and get the heat chrome, pressed up on your cheekbone
And get your beef blown, yo, you better get the troops and power
Homocide and dentists, using 12 guages for root canals and
Your wife called cops and said yo "Blood harassed me"
I caught her in the bed with Blassie and beat her fucking ass G
Then I beat they brains in with two chains
Fuck around get you, your mom duke and your crew slain
You're PUTANG, my right hooks leaving swollen jaws
I be toten fours, smoking raws, with no license in stolen cars
When your walk through Harlem, best be prepared for strangers
Cause most of them is stranglers, cause it's bullets, biscuits and bangers
Nigga

[Hook]
They got luccis, they got doozies
They got fluzzis shooting uzis
They got lawyers, and they doctors
Plus the coppers chasing robbers
For the cheese grab your heat
Cause there's trouble in the street
For the girls they all hate, for the fellas, biscuits and bangers

[Cam'Ron]
Now I was in the boogie down getting some ass
I got a beep from my block, had to split so I dashed
And the Killah ain't been around the way for two days
I called my man 4-0 the green Grand from the ways
When I got to my block, if I wasn't in shock
Then I was cause I found out my cousin got shot
They said yo "It was concerning, the germans, they came through
Blazing, and burning, left Blood squirming
A line blast out, but he got his ass out
Then Capone came in the Grand and drove him to the stash house"
Now I run into the house with the tool in my hand
Tried to do in my man, fucking ruined our plan
When I get in the first, tears start to burst
Cause I see a trail of blood thinking the worst
Flowers, casket, hearse, but nah, all I seen was his left leg split
Dude Capone working on him with the First Aid kit
And they told me the scoop on this wild ass please
It was just a graze, in and out his leg
But they came through dead nasty, it was Fred Blassie
Crew shot shit up quick and then fled fastly
Now I'm thinking - over dough or dice?
Come to find out this is all about his hoeing ass wife
And niggas always pulling guns quick over some chick
Motherfucker that's that some dumb shit, but yo this ain't done with
Cause lifestyle, quite foul, lord ? to my sight now
Turn them germans into ashes Harlem Night style
And that's how it goes when you dealing with stranglers
Girls, the misters and haters, felons biscuits and bangers
