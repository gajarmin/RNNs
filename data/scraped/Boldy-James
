[Intro]
Don't you ever forget. Don't you ever take sides with anyone against the family. Do you hear me? Ever

[Hook: Dej Loaf]
Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (static)
I swear I love my city, I just want a little (static)
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (static)
Detroit vs. Everybody

[Verse 1: Trick Trick]
What up doe, everybody? I'm Detroit
So it's me vs. everybody if you ain't Detroit
We all hood, we love the gun smoke
A message from air traffic control
I'm doin' them niggas bold
Takin' it back to when rappers got beat up out their clothes
Treat 'em like little hoes
Used to wake up to snitches swingin' from light poles
When the booger shook took a light those
Shout out to every nigga that ever made money over in Brightmoor
With the white folks, in the window like a psycho
Puttin' the perfect play together, maestro
And since it's so cold in the D, if you don't come to see me
You might fuck around and see a nigga ice go
Had a lil' homie, run up on him with a knife though
Aiight ho, watch the big homie on the roof with the rifle
Who might go loco and shoot for nothin'
Will go postal with you for somethin'
And I'm willin' to give it to keep the counterfeits up out of my city
Ask around and they all know Tricky
Still pull it together for the kitty
Pour a little liquor for Biggie
And Frank Nitty on the Mickey, send 'em to Diddy
Tried to get me a spot on the Revolt
Switch a man's past from the revolt
Touchin' mothafuckas with the remote
Think your man sleepin' out here but nigga please, he woke

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Dej Loaf]
Ayo east side, raised on that east side
When we just throw our pinkies up along with the peace sign
Fairview street sign, who the fuck are these guys?
Niggas want war, we make 'em feel it, touch their G spot
My grandma sold pies and I ain't talkin' 'bout no key lime
Junkies at the side door, make sure that ain't 5-0
They done set her up, they done hit her with that combo
They done let the dogs out, house smellin' like Pine Sol
That was on the north end, I was on the porch then
Grandma what you cookin' up? Grandma why that fork bent?
Grandma where my mom at? Now I want her, beep her up
Always imagined we was poor and that her feet was up
Jordans, yeah we had 'em on, bitch it wasn't no teasin' us
Remember me and Pooh was in the window eatin' peanut butter
Damn I miss my cousin, I'm like R.I.P. to Trina's son
I'm from where it ain't no love, everybody need a gun

[Verse 3: Guilty Simpson]
Detroit V.S. everybody, P.S
Fuck y'all too, we don't care what y'all do
Still, you can't deny the real
Time reveal, society squeals and the society kill
Money motivated though we take it
These cats are overrated, severely, poppin' up yearly
Then they disappear within the same year
Like it never happened, them niggas just rappin' barely
I'm a shooter, loadin' my magazine and throw the book at 'em
Like a prosecutor, the Glock'll do you like a college tutor
Cause right after class
I teach a mothafucka somethin' and watch him pass
Graduation, I rattle cages
We make some uncomfortable, I didn't grow up like the Huxtables
West 7th where those drugs'll move nonstop
Soft white or hard rock, get everybody in your yard shot
You'll get a feel for my city when I send the welcoming committee
With the 50 calibers and the smoke grey Dodge Challengers
You frown on your face, we'll kick it pretty
When I grip the semi, you better have some grip to give me
Or the steel smokes, you cats are real jokes
You bitch niggas, smack your face numb like you feel coke
Until you get the big picture, mothafucka

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Black Milk]
Let the celebration kick off
This that point in the party where that person start pointin'
That pistol because they're pissed off
Shots lick off, fire spit off
This track put a fire up under me like rockets when they lift off
The map, these rappers that recite raps
We don't believe 'em like that
Deadbeat dad sayin' that he'll be right back
But city that's rough and looked at as them black sheeps
With them rap sheets that's long as track meets
So let's take a stroll, come follow me down these back streets
Where blacks and the trap meet
Killers and dealers that had dreams to be athletes
But them dreams got put in the back seat
And makin' fast funds the shotgun
Got some homies that's still in the hood, life finna twirl
They ask me "what is it like to see the rest of the world?"
Away from the block, away from the gutter
All they know is the blocks and watchin' for cops undercover
So what you have here, some niggas that's never had a fear they couldn't face
Tougher than '89 Laimbeer in the paint
Posted, Chuck D coachin', never laid up
City soil that made us
7 mile with the players, Puritan and PA-ers
[?] where the bullets strayin'
Fenkell where the bodies layin'
6th mile where them hollows sprayin'
Woodward where they ain't playin'
Schoolcraft you find that mayhem where hollows holler in the AM
Gratiot where grandma's stayin'
Neighborhood that's decayin'
Niggas pockets is light so that light bill they're never payin'
So fam don't let your lips talk, that could be your pitfall
And get you sprayed on like murals on side of brick walls
Dudes watchin' waitin' for you to get sloppy
Like a hitman lurkin' in the shadows with his shotty
Out here screamin' "Let's go", yeah my nigga X know
City where the TECs blow but we ain't talkin' techno

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Sino]
I'm stumblin' in my Detroit fitted, bitch
Anybody want some beef then we with it, bitch
Shit, see in the Mitten all my niggas 'bout that action
Might be 30 niggas with me, every nigga with me packin'
No fly zone, shit, just for pussies on that fuck shit
Dirty glove, boy this ain't the city to be fucked with
Shout out my uncle Trick, you get to trippin', he gon' dump quick
My city verses everybody (you gotta kill everybody!)
Boy, RIP to Blade, I hope he hear this
I swear if Ron was free, he'd be the first nigga to kill this
Street nigga, give me a ki and I'ma deal it
Better give a nigga his cash or you can feel it
What up Em, signed the city to Shady and fuck it
They say the world is a bitch, I'ma keep on fuckin' it
My city on my back and I'ma keep on runnin' it
Still got that chopper on the back seat, ain't shit sweet, boy

[Verse 6: Marv Won]
40287, I'm out that black bottom
If they don't fuck with the boy, I bet the crack got 'em
It's enough two faces here to attack Gotham
And ain't nobody a ho until the MACs spot 'em
Dot 'em, play possum, no brave option
All of mine yay choppin' and K shoppin'
The nerve this nigga here can play the part of a goon
Transplant your killers if it ain't no heart in the room
Wait 'til he sugar sharp and then throw salt in the wound
These red beams'll turn your white party maroon
I got a pair of gators that I hardly wear
Nigga I will kill you over these Cartiers
I got a couple bands with the dice on the floor
When I was 9, boy I could tell you the price of a bow
Listen, full length minks just to show we stuntin'
Brother you know it's nothin'
Nigga I'm Komen youngin', tell 'em!

[Hook]

[Verse 7: Payroll]
I'm from the west side blocks where we roll in spots
And have blow blowout sales to blow out a watch
Young niggas gettin' popped cause of the clique they claim
And in most homicides, it's a bitch to blame
My future plan's to stay froze 'til my wrist complains
If rap fails, I'm whippin' coke 'til the brick complains
In the new 6 switchin' lanes, probably with big kis
Ain't talkin' coffee when I say the trunk is where the big be
You see that D right above where my lid be
Can't trust a soul, well that's how these streets did me
I bossed up from setbacks by luck, I rep that
Ain't scared of nigga's shit, I'm from Detroit, I expect that

[Verse 8: Hydro]
Look I'm from Detroit, bitch
Where we crack heads and we break bails
Inspired by the dopeman that pack hammers and make sales
Dreaming of a rollie, a coupe, a crib off of late trails
They quick to take a trip with so much weight that it'd break scales
Young boys wilding, with a chopper they'll make hail
Screaming "fuck the cops" and quick to pop off like some fake nails
Shout out to my strippers with 30 inches and fake tails
And pounds of the cookie like I was running a bake sale
Holla if you need it, I got it, just come and ask the man
Try me and get cheddar on your hand just like a Packer fan
Riding down your mama street with tints on a blacker van
And turn your block into a war zone like we in Pakistan
Nobody I can call on, it's ball or get balled on
Wrists full of that shit you niggas can slip and fall on
Why the fuck you hating us when we can put them all on?
And they can help their little mans and they can hit the mall strong
It's 7 Mile 'till I die, raised by some street niggas
Fuck friends, ain't got none, I'm dolo with this heat, nigga
Boogers in my watch face, my wrists be looking slimey
Once I fuck she's like my seatbelt, I put that bitch behind me, nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 9: Big Gov]
My timing was perfect, designed to be worshiped
Like Jesus as a fetus
Was destined to earn my stripes like Adidas
Needless to say I'm the sniper
Pick us off, niggas soft
While they spitting bars in the middle of a cypher
I'm from the same hood as Big Meech and Big T
So miss me with ho shit or end up on this street
Home of the big three; big cuffs, big guns, big chips
Where broke niggas get hood rich off of quick flips
I'm from the city where the bitches even gangster
Suck a nigga dick, get her robbed, tell 'em thank you
We don't fuck with you outsiders, learn who to talk to
Or get stomped for feeling like the man when you walk through
And I don't even walk around with my chest out
But know it's drama when you see me with my vest out
My next route is finding out where you rest at
Catch you sleep, make the crime scene where you slept at
And the next cat who disrespect my city on some rap shit
I'm on his ass like cellulite on a fat bitch
This shit is drastic and you ain't gotta ask if
A nigga come disrespectful, he leaving out in a casket

[Verse 10: Boldy James]
Detroit VS everybody, that's me against the world
I might not sell a cop, but who need a brick or girl?
A thousand grams on my cock, later alligator
Moist of the aviator, cardi sipping activator
Never been a punk, faker or a lean whipper
Steady packing eighters in a one paper king swish
Concrete, definition of real street nigga
Whole hood know that I'm the only real D nigga
That really mean it when you hear me say I am Detroit
Can hear it in my voice, my fault Em and Royce
For being four days late turning my verse in
But me and Ready Rock was in the spot putting that work in
What was you doing before you ever touched your first ten?
I was in the streets with my peeps getting them chirps in
Text me when the work gone, I text him back the work end
Tryna get my hands on the pack when they first in
On my Captain Planet I possess earth, wind and fire
But you being a liar is the worst sin
Keep throwing rocks at the throne with a glass chin
I'm still that same nigga on the corner with a half grin
I never let these niggas use my ears for no trash cans
Been selling dope for too long, it's time to cash in
King James, before this rap shit I had street fame
And the keys to the city on my key chain

[Hook]

[Verse 11: Kid Vishis]
Whoever said Vishis phony, get to know me
Our hollows'll make a rapper drop the mic, no diss to Joey
Guns of all sizes, I fire and get smokey
Riding with the biggest ratchet on the car dash, I call it Khloe
You think you hard? I think you doughey
His guts'll fall out looking like someone stuck a knife in a stoagie
Homie, you owe me your life
I'm Columbine balling, throwing a stripe
Wiping you out and bounce like a thief in the night
I now control machinery, it's like real steel
Gun ductaped to the tires, that mean I will kill
They say I'm fooling to 'em
They asked me for a hot sixteen
So I lit my notebook on fire and threw it to 'em
Here's a DeJ Loaf punchline
I kill your whole family and leave a red trail, that's your bloodline
Try me, I bust nines
Stick a clock in his mouth and make him chew
Yeah, nigga, it's crunch time

[Verse 12: Big Herk]
We got them choppers, how a nigga with a knife gon' win?
Y'all just shooting the breeze, they done let a cyclone in
This what happen when little mama boys trapped grown men
Lyrically ahead of my time like the iPhone 10
And why Detroit always get a bad name?
My city ready to blow like we here to gas, mane
These niggas thinking they dope, but their shit a tad lame
Man, their pen and pad game more like Trinidad James
Fuck you and whoever you run with
I'm on that BS, I'm still in the middle with dumb shit
I'm a beast, everything you hear me spit real tight
Your flow wack, it's out of Egypt, nigga, it's real light (get it?)
I'mma keep it real, niggas can't fuck with me
It's like I contracted Ebola, they ain't touching me
Detroit VS Everybody, niggas know we started that
Now every city all across the world want a part of this

[Hook]

[Verse 13: Icewear Vezzo]
Street niggas smarter than Kwame, bustin' hardbody
Panorama fold up Porsche, let the car box me
I know niggas ain't sold shit, they did armed robberies
Rugrats buying out bottles and playing with old Tommy's
East side, come to the zone, that's where the lions play
Young niggas stepping on blow, that's where the tigers stay
In my hood the first of the month, that shit a holiday
These cemeteries meet their capacity every fathers day
Hit a lick, keep all the work, get the stolie back
Tell a jeweler don't say shit, just get the Rollie checked
If them niggas bump one lip then get your homies wacked
I swear that you knew my boss, bitch, I'm Tony Jack
Real shooters run in the trap with them choppers out
Heard them niggas bumping their gums, see what they talkin' 'bout
In a spot with so much syrup, this bitch a waffle house
Hit the pharma with so many scripts, could buy the doctors out

[Verse 14: Detroit Che]
I'm Detroit Che
I'm as sick as some syphilis, sicker than Detroit hate
If you come knocking then it's trick or treat
I call up Tricky, load that shit then let that trigger squeeze
That shit ain't sweet, I'm from the murder mitten
Never thought my friend would've been a murder victim
I'm in that van, I want revenge, I'm on some Kendrick shit
I'm pissed off like a mistle, his dick's soft, he's ticked off, he can't get shit hard
If you diss my city I will set it off with a motherfucking semi that's bigger than Big Sean
Our city is Marshall Mathers on Adderall
You better pray we not mad at all when them gats involved
With swisher cap, we're flicking your fucking city off
I'll bust your fucking noggin, you disrespecting my city, dawg
I'm queen Che been on the throne for a minute
Before the cypher I've been slicing dice, these hoes will admit it
Bitch, I'm Slim Shady, we louder than M80's
No, I'm just playing, hope he hears it, I'm just saying
I'm a renegade, pussy sweeter than lemonade
You'll never penetrate
DeJ, tell these bitches to try me, I'mma demonstrate
Vez, tell them that I got options, I'm a real estate
On them properties like monopoly
Detroit VS Everybody, I make a verse versus everybody
Fuck your city, no fly zone, nigga, it's Detroit Che versus everybody
Detroit vs everybody, it's Detroit vs everybody
Fuck your city, no fly zone, nigga, it's my city versus everybody

[Verse 15: Calicoe]
(I just have to talk shit for a minute, man
I have to get in my zone, man, huh
It's the going, going, back, back to Cali, Cali, to Cali Cali)
Cali Cali, that's where I get them cheaper at
Your number like my number, I need a number I can reach you at
Want my price, then you get a price, I want at least a stack
You pay my flight, then you pay your flight, I'll meet you back
Middle man in my own plug, I can teach you that
Detroit vs everybody, who could compete with that?
You thinking everybody zips slow cause they got a plug?
My nigga, everybody zips slow cause I'm showing love
So whenever you make a flip again just know I'm showing love
If cash die, I'm on the strip again, just know I'm throwing dubs
Big roochies on the Michelins, rolling A1 dubs
Mind on my money, fuck a nigga tryna hold a grudge
Them crabs in the bucket used to slow me up
And now I'm sitting at the top and it's lonely as fuck
Got 20 thousand for my red bottoms
Cause I was standing in this blood after I headshot 'em, nigga

[Verse 16: Diezel]
It's me, bitch
Mafia captain, OG, bitch
20 years, been Detroit vs whoever, nigga
The right hand to the hand that be gettin' niggas
Goon squad mafia, mobbin'
For this dirty mothafucka, where it's my home
And I love this mothafucka
So I stood on the front line, ready for one time
Duck some shots, and buck bled for my line
All for the love of the palm of the dirty glove
Every hood, every block, nigga one love
7 mile is the hood where I came up
Pray the game keep it and get your weight up
Bitch you better say us when you're talkin' 'bout next
Detroit niggas stood up when put to the test
Like what? Nigga, who? What the fuck
Anybody wanna do? We ain't hear shit
One army, one city, one sound
It's Detroit, gon' shut shit down
It's time to return the king his crown
Fuck who got next, nigga we got now[Verse 1: Chuck Inglish]
And it's falling off the side like back fat
Giving girls rides to the crib not a rat trap
Cheese, peanut butter freeze raps
I want all these snapped in his back in the day
Like a tall tee tag
I need that whip clean G
What's the weather gon be
Drop top, no drips on this upholstery
Supposed to be headed downtown
Carwash like blaow
And my girl drive the chevy while I break this tree down
Roll the window back up
Good, turn it back up
Ugh, UGK
Diamonds & Wood
Hold up, yea roll up
That's tight, that's right
You do this right, you might have the time of your life

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
Coming from the Westside but my fitted say Sox
Where you get banged on if you in it or not
Looking like Cain cause I watch Menace a lot
And I'm tryna fuck your friend so is she with it or not
Shout out to ATL cause I'm in Lennox a lot
And I dont like looking, I go in there to cop
Houston High Rollers, I go in it a lot
Spending money with the strippers you go in there to watch
Blowin on L's, smelling like Chanel
You say you the man but dawg these bitches can't tell
But ladies love Dom cause I'm gettin that mail
To make it out my hood is like to make it out of jail
Put the tens up and start breaking out the twelves
Bet I have your girlfriend shaking out her heels
We shaking all deals
And chasing all meals
I'm popping all over how you haters all feel

[Big Sean]
Smoke good, fuck better
Count money, what's better
These lil niggas can't hang
Big shit popping bitch and big my first name
I'm a Westsider, Detroit player
Fuck around and I might bring back gators
Everyday I leave the crib with no money
And come back later with that muthafucking paper
Finally famous over erything thats just how I feel bitch
They trying to stop my shine
They yellin hit the kill switch
Wrong nigga to deal with
Less you doing a deal with
Grind hard, thats how I was built bitch
Whoa there, whoa there
I'm who everybody know here
I come through in the club and get more money than promoters
Oh thats your girl
I see her at my show there
I be off in the hood I bet you dont ever go there
Ayy so slow there boy
Don't go there boy
It's people you dont know there boy
Young nigga that's addicted to the Polaroids
And I gave these niggas more lines than corduroy
And my bitches be gorgeous boy
Showtime I hope you record em boy
I'm out here

[Boldy James]
Let's reel half of a brick and bring it back to the kitchen
See the crack its fizzing
Then bring it back when its finished
Jimbo put that on a dish
And Chizzel will bag it and sell it
Then boldly factor the digits
To know the cash that I'm flipping
Six gonna get stashed in the ceiling
6-O's in traffic I'm pitching this o
That one get split and broke to halves
And this one his o
And that one is his
And this o I'm bagging and this one
This o the last
The nigga Ro is a crackilitician
Rolling the ave cause I'm getting dough in that slab
Cause I'm getting over, they mad
I just grill 'em bro, with my mag on my briches
Know I'll blast if you tempt him
Bro you will crash in your whip with holes in your back cause you hit
Going as fast as your engine go
When you smash in the strip smoking a bag with your bitch
Choking, gasping for breath holding
Grabbing your chest from boldly magging that tech
Unload it faster than Vick's concreture school craft to the the sick
Bomb as a brick

[Asher Roth]
I be frustrated with the way that shit's been aging
And I'm about to take a break and get away on a vacation
Like, maybe Malaysia to escape the meditation
I'll just eat, pray and wait for my day of revelation or I'll
Take peyote, roam the rivers of Nairobi
Change my name to Navajo and live alone and only grow weed
Cause this, Naomi flowing show gets pretty lonely
Don't nobody ever know you
Everybody call you homie
Mony Mony they'll be sure to treat you phony
As soon as you hit your low they won't be picking up the phone
See, I moved to (Comie ?) show these fools that I am home
And when Im on the microphone all you wanna-be's can blow me
So, take this boner to the dome you little bo-peeps
That may be inapropy but Im certainly no sheep
See, I only lead in this game of entertainment
Roth and Big Sean
We on Finally Famous

[Chip Tha Ripper]
Yea, now roll ten of em up
Fuck the rules we Auntie Anne's pretzel bendin em up
Don't give a fuck/Word to your daddy leather sandals
Either pay the light bill or light up them candles
Regular White Owl Cigarillo, no Flavors
Break that bitch down and peel of the first layer
Smooth, like a baby's ass
Mercedes pass
The ladies ask can they be next cause I'm kicking their favorite raps
Life is playing 2k and kicking raps all day by the lake
Smoking truth till I collapse in broad day
I'm surfing, radical
Gnarly, far out
My stoner chicks gather round soon as I break the jar out
Ay baby girl pass the blizz-ard
Your woman chose me so I had to jizz her
Don't be sleeping or taking no cat naps
We leaders of the new school with these fat raps[Verse 1: JMSN]
How you doing, how you been?
See you still got the same so called friends
But I ain’t judging, to me it’s nice
To know this is what you made your life

[Hook]
On the surface everything can look so nice
But if you meet the girl inside you might think twice
She’ll be your habit, yeah, your one and only vice
Don’t you know that everything you want comes with a price?

[Hook]
Girl I used to know
It’s been a minute since I’ve seen her
It’s been a minute since I’ve seen her
It’s been a minute since I’ve seen her
Girl I used to know
It’s been a minute since I’ve seen her
It’s been a minute since I’ve seen her
It’s been a minute since I’ve seen her

[Verse 2: JMSN]
Say what you want, say what you like
Her eyes will keep you up at night
No matter what you try to do
She’ll always have her hooks in you

[Hook]

It’s been a minute since I’ve seen her

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Boldy James]
She ain't the same, actin' all brand new
Things will never be the same, she ain't the girl I knew
It's King James, it's true
Concreature, first they love you
Then they hate you, then they love you again

The girl I used to know, just another face
It’s the classic mix up, honest mistake
Looking at her picture, sitting by the lake
Ain’t seen her in a minute but we still conversate
On a platonic basis, cause’ it’s complicated
You and your friends been had a bad reputation
If I’m not mistaken, only thing I was chasing
Was a dollar and a dream, just trying to make it
Difference ‘tween me and them, I’m a gangster
I admit you had me whipped, dominatrix
Had to flip the script, lot of time was wasted
My time is money and I don’t got the patience
I could be flipping bricks, I’d rather pound the pavement
With my Concreature congressmen congregating
Presidential shit, call it Obamanation
That’s big spit pimp soup, real conversation

[Hook][Verse 1: Boldy James]
I'm a lunatic, I got 5 on it once the doobie lit
We was lockin' my room door stuffin the Boosie clips
Runnin' with hooligans I put in my work
Wipe the slugs and guns off, with the tip of my shirt
Two .23's, when we ride on our enemies
And hit em up if they don't hit me up first
And my army fatigued, it's still gunpowder on the sleeve
Niggas get shot every day B pull down ya skirt
Before I lift it up, show the whole world ya pussy
And how you niggas been some bitches since birth
Cause we them Sig Sauer boys hittin' em where it hurts
Twistin nigga's cap back and pop a nigga
With a squig and a squirt
He dug his own grave, I'm just revealin' the dirt
Got some bullets to chase a nigga, to the end of the earth
Until we meet again, I think with death ima flirt
Give her that old evil grin and my devilish smirk

[Hook: Domo Genesis]
Fuck y'all niggas what y'all wanna do
Bumpin' my new shit mobbin' with the crew
Stuck to the blueprint and ride with the tool
Let me know if it's a problem cause the solving we could do

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
Dead bullies and Red Bull is all in his stomach
With a couple bitches with whom relations ended abruptly
Grab the mickey and the coaster and sit it
Now I been sober a minute, ho tell your soldiers forget it
Spit it as cold as the frigid, dare me to host it and shit
Just carry the flow to the clinic, carry the coast on my shoulders
Various hoes in the whip and they blowin' smoke at the chauffeur
Carry the dope in they britches, bury a foe in the ocean
I can't help it it's Tan Cressida, gram sellers
Pantera records and bodies stuffed in the damp cellar
Far from the fronting, my niggas was in the back
Yelling cause we came from nothing like everything that you can't tell us
Speak soft, sock a fan, shut the camera off
Ramp camp Camelot, canon cocked, lick a shot
Bop, bop liquor slosh bottom of the belly
Bars lock hard hitting like they squabbing with the celly

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Da$h]
Smokin' over green
Exhalin' dragon breath up out my nasal
All the staples married with the basil
It's too reg, get it off my table
Way I pimp, shoulda stuck withe shrimp
Dick stuck to her lips, the money stuck to my thumbs
I'm spittin' rounds like a drum
Bitch said that man was a bum
And he think he got that bag
Get her high and dog her ass
She telling me 'bout homie stash
I listen up and roll my grass
Before the blunt was even ashed
I hit my homie on the jack like
Just got the word on what the lick read[Verse 1: Pell]
They saying what's good? Cause they can't see it on my damn face
Hit the club sick cause I got too much on my damn plate
She sweet as baked goods, got me asking how the pan taste
I know you ain't a shone but just pop it for my man's sake
I'm thirsty, ain't gotta tell me what that Andre do
And we just got my nigga back, so we gone probably pop a few
Never trust a broke chicken heads off my cockatoo
I show out til the show out get applause and then we make a move
Living inside coronas, getting well roasted, ducking cops
Different day different dawn but the same problems, yet I try be cool like they ain't watching
And you say you got wings that's fly, but I know you lying
Cause we in the streets never seen you grind, no worries surely I handle mine
Like a fifth not big enough but I don't really care  cause I'm showing love
Now the pretty bad girls wanna give hugs, too turnt too turnt don't need a plug!
Too faded in my zone don't need drugs, light years away now that I got buzz
Got Sampha portions that's too much, do work in stealth so I move clutch
That's too fun

[Hook: Pell]
You say you got wings that's fly, but who do they belong to?
You saying that you know what they like, but is it what you want too?
Who you fooling? Bitch, we saying what we doing (2x)
Who you fooling? Keep control and keep it moving (2x)

[Verse 2:Pell]
Can't sleep but I wanna dream, thoughts dance like they on a beam
I need to breathe, inhale like where heaven at?
Get high cause I need a laugh, you wanna drag?
Conversing with walls in my drawers, pissed dawg cause my body won't let me drift off
Been robbed of my sleep cause I'm reading tweets barred, like I care about your interview
Baptize in the hen like a sinner do, good kid mad lit that's a swimming pool
Need a break every sip that's an interlude, take shots cause we bulletproof
I'm living invincible, feeling like I've been here before
Counting black sheep as my brain freeze, letting my thoughts turn fictional
Where the culture at? Bumping Kanye around the culdesac
No one ever said I was cold at rap, until I took a little break now they want him back
Lose sleep while I chase dreams, lacto but I make cream
Rap wade like I'm waste deep, too hazy I can't see, eyes closed now it's hd
Peace

[Hook: Pell}
You say you got wings that's fly
You say you got wings that's..
You saying that you know what they like, but is it what you want too?
Who you fooling? Bitch, we saying what we doing (2x)
Who you fooling? Keep control and keep it moving (2x)

[Verse 3: Boldy James]
You trying to hold on to something that's been so gone for so long
You stealing dope, trying to figure out where did you go wrong?
But the show must go on, so fuck all of you dickriders
You know i've been a big timer, so yeah I get my roll on
My Sprite look kind of muddy, that cookie is my cologne
My sight set on that money, so that pussy getting prolonged
So why you on that one tip trying to find out what your ho on
Smoking on that one shit that been fucking up the o-zone
Im rolling on the westside, you can catch me trapping dolo
Man I hope they got my good side when the feds be snapping photos
Im tracking Han Solo, hunchback and Quasimoto
You can't divorce me Dorothy, you can't go back to Kansas Toto
Star status bro bro
That means I got Benz on the floor
You a friend or a foe?
All they do is this, and I know people don't dance no more
And we ain't never running out of work, while you niggas going half on an O
And that's why when you ran your mouth, bitch nigga I just ran through a boat
On the low

[Hook][Verse 1: Boldy James]

I nicknamed everythang; Nicknamed Moochie
My dank Mary Jane and my Big Chain Julie
A deuce is a split. A baby is a Stewie
A kilo is a Brick. A quarter is a quewy
If you telling, you a Snitch. County is the Skidooski
A Sentence is a Bid, and Prison is the Hoopski
A Shooter is a Goonie, Flick is a whole clip
On some Motion Picture shit, take you to see a Movie
A Square is a Loosey, a Pistol is a Throwaway
On a good day, ay, you can call me Juicy J
You a fake nigga, U.S.P.A. Polo with two men on a horse
That mean you niggas gay
I call my wife Sunshine cuz when I'm feeling gray
Like my son eyes, She always brighten up my day
I'm from the darkside; I call it The Dead Giveaway
Gotta be alert at all times, Triple A

[Hook: Boldy James]
Nicknamed Moochie. Nicknamed Moochie
I nicknamed everythang, nicknamed Moochie

(Yo, Check me out)

[Verse 2: Boldy James]

Me, I'm a Concreature, i call guns Heaters
AK is the Chopper, I call my nine "Nina"
And my Glock, E-40 and the Click
Errol Flynn'in in the spot, like Detroit, we in this bitch
What up tho? Going hand to hand is hustlin'
And of course, a Grand is a Band of Brothers
I call acting brand new 'Frontin'', bitch please
Really, all i need is pussy, weed, liquor, brand new money
And my Revolver. Call it my Mag
If a bitch still walkin', i call her a Strag
When i got the bird in, they callin 'em slabs
When i got the work in, I call it the bag?
Shit niggas stole from me, they callin' it 'Swag'
That's a different kinda person, we call 'em a fag
I Fucked my Money Up, spent all of my cash
At the bar still splurging, they call it a Tab

[Hook][Verse 1: Boldy James]
They say its never rains in Southern California
But when you from a state where it's always snowin'
You tend to not believe the things that people tell you
Shit that I done seen please believe they gon' fail you
In your time of dire needs street dreams they gon' sell you
Take you to a place where can't nobody gon' help you
Or run to your rescue
I give respect where it's due
You, you only gonna do what I let you
Nigga don't let me catch you
With this Drew Bledsoe
And I look at you
Reaching for a gun you can't get to
Beat you to the stash
It don't matter what he grab when I flash
You can have drum on your pistol
Or a pack of machines stuffed full of SCUD missiles
With extended machines niggas gon' get they issue
By any means, shit, we more than official
Put you out of your misery
Have a morgue and it

[Hook: Boldy James]
Who do you believe in? (Me or them?)
Cause looks can be deceiving (So think again)
And I done been deceived
So it's a lot of things that don't sit right with me
So be easy (cool my dude)
Who do you believe in? (Me or them?)
Cause looks can be deceiving (When you me)
And by the looks of things this shit ain't what it seems nigga
Just give me a reason

[Verse 2: Vince Staples]
Bullets holes in Momma whip
7 chrome in my Momma couch
Watchin' the way I'm walking before they run in my Momma House
Baby bro with the problems, I promise he'll never talk it out
Grammar school I draw on the lines, was born to chalk them out
5-0's from the G-Unit in the raid van, but I seen through it
Got a deuce 5 and the skate highs, that was 10th grade back in 09'
Got a .45 soon as Nitty died, on the North side banging 65
I don't give passes, back-back and shit-bag I'm shit drastic
Piss-poor so I skip classes, still got on them Jays though
No problem nigga, I pop a nigga to get the shit that he paid for
Brown bandana sittin' on my face, I'm a Yannc ho
Got a black bitch from Bompton down to spank hoes
Never hit the court room, stayin' with that Drake flow
Trying to get that Drake dough, livin' where he started at
Eight ain't got no hammer just blam 'em ain't gotta cock it back
Boy

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Boldy James]
After the first time it's pretty much a piece of cake
So if you ain't 'bout this life you probably can't relate to it
If you were silver spoon fed back in '88
I had to eat with my hands out of paper plates
Made my great escape
Satan's greatest trick was convincing the world that he didn't exist
So meet the man out the myth, the devil in the flesh
Hell block, drugs zone seven six Detroit Michigan
We the new Bangladesh, the source and the fear
I need a new weigh connect (trey six)
To give em to me for the two way
But of course that depends on if you make it back
? have you ever perhaps been in a trap so hot you couldn't relax?
Sweatin' bullets, hunnit shots in a TEC
Gotta crook in my neck and it ain't no lookin' back

[Hook][Verse 1]
You can't have no friends in real life
When all you do is bag up grams and sell white
Gotta find some way to stash these bands
And hide this cash
If they trip over my stash they set for life
I recognize it's hard to get it and keep it
Easy to jeopardize
Risk ain't worth the reward, pay it no never mind
Take it in stride and if worse comes to worst
You always board your first, never your second mind
Mind your business and never mix business with friendship
Cause friends be the ones in the end when it's all said and done
Who can you call? Who can you run to?
Will they come through on the humble?
Or will they drop the ball and fumble
I wouldn't be surprised
I've seen it all out my own two eyes
Before he died my uncle
Said, "if you let it slide it'll come back to haunt you"

[Hook]
400 thousand
I got all of this money and can't trust a soul to help me count this
400 thousand
Now the kush and the bricks got me pushing whips that ain't even out yet
400 thousand
Know how you know you getting money when you spend a thousand dollars on an outfit
400 thousand
I got all of this money and can't trust a soul to help me count this
400 thousand

[Verse 2]
My son asked what's the most money I ever counted
I told him 'bout $460,000
All dope money from whipping ounces
Slow rolling them snow bunnies in Clinton Township
The bastards tried to get me 'bout six
For transacting them graham crackers of that brown shit
Had me surrounded
They jam trafficked them vans and back of them Crown Vics
But they never found shit
During the fed run-ins, out in southwest
Used to have to get plugged into the outlet
Bagging up in the house, stressed, ask Justin
Man, I used to have nothing, but now I'm rich
No more out of town trips, jumping on the road
No change of clothes, same old outfit
In the natty we hit the outlet
What I blew on business True Religion denim could've bought a couch set

[Hook][Boldy James]
Turn me up
Yeah, let me hit that dope after you man
Gangsta Gibbs, Boldy Blocks
Let's get it

(Verse)
I’m on the first thing smokin', smokin' on some dope
That I got from out in Oakland from my nigga Slow Motion
With the Mac Miller's, me and my fam the most dopest
Crackin' my drugs, back against the wall, overdosin'
Michael Jack thriller, Eminem to Billy Ocean
And you know (?) when the going gets tough, the tough gets goin'
All of a sudden, half these niggas candy canin'
And sugarcoating the money they're makin' in the hood for roles
Caught up in the moment, never even touched a ho
Got 'em on the mild drugs longer then you fuckin notice
I know some youngins quick to up it that's ready to blow
And we don’t play no homegirls, real homephobic
It’s concreatures but you already know the slogan
Abbreviate, my appreciation is a token
Laughing all the way to the bank, no lackin' or loafin'
Keep a couple addicts to get a new packet of dope in
Taxin 'em 4 bands, slap 'em with no hands
Hand to hand, handin' samples out – that’s free promotion
Jealousy is a weak emotion, picture me rollin'
Speedboat, by the beach, ocean, at the Boat Races

[Freddie Gibbs]

(Verse)
Gangsta G.I., 87 kush smoke
Ship it off and get my pocket used to bust it open
Hennessey and Coca-Cola keep a nigga locin'
Slow it up promethazine and Fanta, gold potion
Pull shit, drug dealer and abuser
I used to get up and crumble the oxycontin and get zooted
Sprinkle it in my weed ‘cause I was way too scared to use it
In a movie like a young don, serving heron, shootin
Takin' nails out my sock, then in a nigga's pocket
Shit is heatin for you bastards
I’m 4 in the morning Glockin'
And leave my nigga cop the Cola, the soda and yola lockin up
Today I slip my feet in new sneakers like Mr. Rogers biiitch
Hold me down, the poster child for pyrex visual
My kitchen now you know the stanky shit be in the air
You buy the first, I front the second, call me in a pair
I said I’m steppin' on a crack, I break these birds off like Kevin Ware

Bitch, uh yea
I said I’m steppin' on a crack, I break these birds off like Kevin Wear bitch[Boldy James]
It's Concreatures
Boldy Blocks
227
Brave and courageous in Detroit, Michigan
His grades is abrasions and 8ball hemorages
Straight shell cases, ARs, Remingtons
Spray fields and gages tear apart ligaments
Separatin' them gang starrs from gentlemen
Redecoratin' paint jobs and interior
It's serious, put the pipin' on this leather seat
Let this ? spider web in this V
Taco meat on your driver seat, split your lima bean
The four pound lama beamin' down him and gut him clean
When they visit him in trauma, full-body sling
His baby mama and his mama hollering, screaming
"My baby never hurt nobody why that fucking heathen
Boldy shoot him down, them bullets bothering his breathing"
Now every time that it rains he thinks about that evening
For heartache and pain, killers blame Concreatures

[Hook]
Bold
My trigger finger is itchy scratchy
Right, my middle finger it grip that maggy
Tight, my ring fingers embrace my gun
Yikes, and my pinky fingers anchor my thumbs
Strike, the thumb on my other hand click the hammer
Yup, my left index is ambidextrous
Left fuck you finger the reason I squoze
Put them gloves on, I'll teach you the meaning of Bold

[Boldy James]
I ain't superstitious but somethin' is fishy
I keep havin' dreams them officials comin' to get me
At night I can't sleep, keep switchin' to where my chips be
Cause they'll break the bank, take it all, leave you on empty
Can't make a call, they tap all into your frequencies
Invade your privacy, put The Wire on your team
Can you survive the heat, indictment sheets or affidavits
Or make a statement, ratting for an occupation
Cracking under the pressure, you less than a man
Banned from the street, your best friend in the fed
Pen out of ink from all the shit you wrote and writ
In the pens out them clinks talkin' like you on a writ
Ain't that a bitch, you done snitched
Got your partner a bid, take a cop twenty years
Still do about ten, none of his men said a word
Stayed true to the end, because he sang like a bird
They doing Jupiter years
Bold

[Hook][Intro]

[Verse 1]
Bandidos, bandidos
Left pocket full of BBQ Fritos
Bandidos, bandidos
And this is not your cheese, bitch, Doritos
Bandidos, bandidos
Free Chi and R.I.P. Santino
My gambinos, for selling dinos
I got a pocket full of flamin' hot Cheetos
However you want it my nigga you can get it
I usually sell 'em whole, but for you I can split it
And cook it right in front of you, just give me 20 minutes
And that's gonna cost you if I gotta show you how I did it
Mixing baking soda with the yola, I'm a wizard
And my wrist game colder than an Oreo blizzard
Spend 15 O's out a quarter of a chicken
5 O's over that's an extra 10 big ones
If you really getting money, in Detroit we say you getting 'em
If you got it all on you, shit then where the fuck is it
Cause I don't fuck with no snitches
I keep most of my bidness
On the need to know and all you need to know is what's the ticket on a chirps

[Hook 2x]
(Kilos, birds, chickens, eagles, bricks)
(Kilos, birds, chickens, eagles, bricks)
(Hard, soft, however you want it nigga)
(Hard, soft, however you want it nigga)

[Verse 2]
I got them bandidos
And I been coppin soft, nigga you can ask Gino
R.I.P. E Flowers and Moschino
Been getting money in the park ask Bino
Free D-Lo, what up Cino
The whole crack spiff love me, ask lil B-O
And skito, remember me and little D-Bo
Used to live in house on mana behind the P-O
Or when I was in Boysville, paying the C-O
To sneak in morphine pills for me and Speedo
Cortez like "What you gonna do when you get free Bo?"
Buy 2 guns and another quarter a kilo
While y'all niggas is at Northlands, skating in trios
I was on the highway with a quarter a kilo
And I did it all my way, without Carlito
In the hood brick life and with that libo
And [?] selling chirps

[Hook 2x][Intro]

Roses are red, (yeah)
Violets are blue (concreatures)
When the roses are dead (Boldy blocks!)
I'd die for you (King James)
Detriot

She loves me
She loves me not
My love is deep
So I hug the Block

(Connie!)

[Verse 1]

You had me open, that's when you stole my heart
Then you broke it, now I need open heart
I quit smokin, but now I'm smokin carts
Drinkin whole fifths, because my sober thoughts
Full of emotion, you must have throwed me off
From being focused, cause seems like my focus off
You need a moment, now that we've grown apart
It's been too long for me to fix your lonely heart
But being broken, I sat alone in the dark
Singin' this song that I writ you that I wrote from the heart
But when I wrote this, you were gone now I'm lost
& heart broken, though I know in my heart I've gorwn
Went from being torn apart to Hulk Hogan
Mixed with the Incredible Hulk on such short notice
I tried but you don't want to talk
Now you want a divorce, I just want to be yours

[Chorous]

She loves me not
She loves me
She loves me not
My old lady steady bullshittin
Telling me to stop
But I'll leaver her ass before I leave this fuckin' block

She loves me
And you ain't got to love me
Cause if you don't, the block will hug me

She loves me
She loves me not
My love is deep
I hug the block

[Verse 2]

She loves me, when you don't
Connie does shit for me that I know that you won't
When I ask if you love me, you'll proabably say that you don't
Denying how you feel when you know that you do
Quit lying to yourself if you know that it's true
All the times we shared, this the moment of truth
Cause truth be told, I'm in love with you
But you did me wronger than two left shoes
And love is an emotion you can't choose
But since you chose, I've been stuck and glued
To what's under the soles of my 1's and 2's
You did a nigga bold left me so confused
She never did me wrong, I trusted you
And you left me in the cold, and crushed my grove
She put a nigga on, you cut my fuse
And took a nigga soul when you upped and moved

[Chorous]

[Verse 3] - Tennile

Baby I won't leave you
My eyes light up every time I see you
Low profile, GQ smooth
Your own style, nothing like these other street dudes
You different, that's why you the one
I was right there with you when you shot your first gun
Scared shitless, surprised you ain't run
Had nightmares with you, tossing in your bunk
Damn I miss you (They caught a nigga up)
All them nights spent with you, I'm falling in love
All over again, want to spend my life with you cause you more than a friend
And it feel right when you take hold of my hand
And the steel in the night, let go and you dead
If you get yourself bodies, I won't forget the times you stood by me
You my number one concreature
Love
Connie

P.S. The block

[Chorous][Boldy James]
My 1st Chemistry Set
Blocks, Chemist
Cook up
Yeah
Finished with this last hundred thou' through the money counter
Movin' the bag and I'm runnin' out in record timin'
Geneva band bright, with excessive diamonds
All you can move is puppy chow and New England clam chowder
You mismatchin' designers, I'm ? and the powder
And V12's and problems, and I ain't have a license
As I multiply and divide addin' money
I never paid attention in class except for math and science
Live in the lap of lux, smokin' on Cali's finest
These niggas so puss you'd have thought that they had vaginas
That's why we clap 'em up, ten packs, bloodclot 'em
I got ninety nine problems and a brick ain't one
I got thirty five shots, yeah the clip that dumb
And my handgun it look retarded as a chopper
We built this from the ground up, started from the bottom
It's Concreatures, game time, money ain't a problem

[Hook]
Pocket full of stacks
I had to take into consideration
That when you gettin' money, ain't no limitation
To what niggas'll do to get they hands on this paper (better tell 'em)
Have my critters come and lay down that demonstration
187
Cause niggas hate it when you get they bitches naked (bold)
And your chain made out of a bunch of tennis bracelets (cold)
And your closet full of fresh, put one in the sky (do it)
We're talking nothing but the best that money can buy

[Boldy James]
I got real expensive taste and I live an extravagant lifestyle
My left pocket: six G's, the other one: ten bands
And my watch on Swizz Beatz: I'm the one man band man
Four in my right palm, two in my left hand
In the back of the club doin' the band dance
All around the board, I was born in the USA
Guess you could say this an American Band Stand
Three hundred eighties got my man jammed
Now it's meet me at the Little Caesars my baby
I got them pan pans
Half assed think you slick, with a bag full of tricks
While you try'na penny pinch, I'm try'na cram jam
Twenty two grand in my True Religion brand pants
I sold a hundred grams, that's another ten bands
Put a one on it, that's an extra ten grams
I cook so much dope, I need two wristbands
And I ball so hard, I need a headband
It's Concreatures till I'm dead or in the fed pen

[Hook][Louie P. Newton]
Say she never seen a dream sold like this before
Or encountered one that's cold like this before
Swore she wouldn't fall for it, then she seen I'm missin' more
And keep askin' me why I'm creatin' all this distance for
It's traditional, church but not a piscopo
I make her work for that position, it's a privilege ho
Her first taste of red wine and medicinal
And I ain't mad, she think my belt buckle is mistletoe
I ain't dissin' though, it's strictly principle
Stay poppin' tags homie, I ain't missin' dough
And it's probably cause I'm gettin' chose
And she workin' so hard, I can get another chick fa sho
She know I'm hardly home, party with my Carti's on
And get Wolfgang Puck fresh at the drop of a button
With no discussion, like it's nothin'
I take it till she realize that she was bluffin'
I'm cold on 'em

[Hook]
She give me everything
Tell me I don't owe her nothin'
They say I'm cold on these hoes
David Ruffin

[Boldy James]
It's James Jones, drug zone
Meet your neighbor, hoodlum
They say I'm cold on these hoes, I came up from nothin'
Slangin' bowls for them pros, every day I'm hustlin'
We get the low, get 'em gone, in a day it's nothin'
Got the trap bunkin', my connect Russian/rushing
When I double what you cop, now that's frontin'
Niggas frontin' like they live, nigga stop frontin'
Cause that shit'll get you shot, and I'm not bluffin'
We'll run up in your spot, get to bustin' plural
Now his block's a mural, full of Care Bears and Teddy Ruxpins
Runnin' from the black and yellows, black and yellows, packin' metal
Had to throw my crack and ran go get my thumper
Cause the other day they found my nigga in the dumpster
Thinkin' 'bout all the dirt we did when we was youngsters
Led astray, the hood try'na take me under
Streets didn't kill me, only made me stronger

[Hook]

[GLC]
A pimp from the 'go, I give a ho
Some pimpin' to go, my ism critical
Amnesia pimpin', I hit it then forget a ho
Girl I beat that pussy up, call that boy Riddick Bowe
Teddy Pendergrass, Love TKO
Countin' plenty cash, blowin' kush and plenty hash
It's what we have, playa what you got?
That 31 from the Pacers
We gettin' paper, let this ism motivate you
? bother them ass shots, trusty in your stash spot
Man I just gave her game to change her from a have not
Who she gave that paper to the moment that she came out
Why she came in here with you and leavin' in my fast car?
Fool, she drove on a player call it Nascar
Y'all speedballin', fallin' like I'm John ??
Cold on these hoes, chuuch, Pope John Paul

[Hook][Intro]
Don't you ever forget. Don't you ever take sides with anyone against the family. Do you hear me? Ever

[Hook: Dej Loaf]
Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (static)
I swear I love my city, I just want a little (static)
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (static)
Detroit vs. Everybody

[Verse 1: Trick Trick]
What up doe, everybody? I'm Detroit
So it's me vs. everybody if you ain't Detroit
We all hood, we love the gun smoke
A message from air traffic control
I'm doin' them niggas bold
Takin' it back to when rappers got beat up out their clothes
Treat 'em like little hoes
Used to wake up to snitches swingin' from light poles
When the booger shook took a light those
Shout out to every nigga that ever made money over in Brightmoor
With the white folks, in the window like a psycho
Puttin' the perfect play together, maestro
And since it's so cold in the D, if you don't come to see me
You might fuck around and see a nigga ice go
Had a lil' homie, run up on him with a knife though
Aiight ho, watch the big homie on the roof with the rifle
Who might go loco and shoot for nothin'
Will go postal with you for somethin'
And I'm willin' to give it to keep the counterfeits up out of my city
Ask around and they all know Tricky
Still pull it together for the kitty
Pour a little liquor for Biggie
And Frank Nitty on the Mickey, send 'em to Diddy
Tried to get me a spot on the Revolt
Switch a man's past from the revolt
Touchin' mothafuckas with the remote
Think your man sleepin' out here but nigga please, he woke

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Dej Loaf]
Ayo east side, raised on that east side
When we just throw our pinkies up along with the peace sign
Fairview street sign, who the fuck are these guys?
Niggas want war, we make 'em feel it, touch their G spot
My grandma sold pies and I ain't talkin' 'bout no key lime
Junkies at the side door, make sure that ain't 5-0
They done set her up, they done hit her with that combo
They done let the dogs out, house smellin' like Pine Sol
That was on the north end, I was on the porch then
Grandma what you cookin' up? Grandma why that fork bent?
Grandma where my mom at? Now I want her, beep her up
Always imagined we was poor and that her feet was up
Jordans, yeah we had 'em on, bitch it wasn't no teasin' us
Remember me and Pooh was in the window eatin' peanut butter
Damn I miss my cousin, I'm like R.I.P. to Trina's son
I'm from where it ain't no love, everybody need a gun

[Verse 3: Guilty Simpson]
Detroit V.S. everybody, P.S
Fuck y'all too, we don't care what y'all do
Still, you can't deny the real
Time reveal, society squeals and the society kill
Money motivated though we take it
These cats are overrated, severely, poppin' up yearly
Then they disappear within the same year
Like it never happened, them niggas just rappin' barely
I'm a shooter, loadin' my magazine and throw the book at 'em
Like a prosecutor, the Glock'll do you like a college tutor
Cause right after class
I teach a mothafucka somethin' and watch him pass
Graduation, I rattle cages
We make some uncomfortable, I didn't grow up like the Huxtables
West 7th where those drugs'll move nonstop
Soft white or hard rock, get everybody in your yard shot
You'll get a feel for my city when I send the welcoming committee
With the 50 calibers and the smoke grey Dodge Challengers
You frown on your face, we'll kick it pretty
When I grip the semi, you better have some grip to give me
Or the steel smokes, you cats are real jokes
You bitch niggas, smack your face numb like you feel coke
Until you get the big picture, mothafucka

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Black Milk]
Let the celebration kick off
This that point in the party where that person start pointin'
That pistol because they're pissed off
Shots lick off, fire spit off
This track put a fire up under me like rockets when they lift off
The map, these rappers that recite raps
We don't believe 'em like that
Deadbeat dad sayin' that he'll be right back
But city that's rough and looked at as them black sheeps
With them rap sheets that's long as track meets
So let's take a stroll, come follow me down these back streets
Where blacks and the trap meet
Killers and dealers that had dreams to be athletes
But them dreams got put in the back seat
And makin' fast funds the shotgun
Got some homies that's still in the hood, life finna twirl
They ask me "what is it like to see the rest of the world?"
Away from the block, away from the gutter
All they know is the blocks and watchin' for cops undercover
So what you have here, some niggas that's never had a fear they couldn't face
Tougher than '89 Laimbeer in the paint
Posted, Chuck D coachin', never laid up
City soil that made us
7 mile with the players, Puritan and PA-ers
[?] where the bullets strayin'
Fenkell where the bodies layin'
6th mile where them hollows sprayin'
Woodward where they ain't playin'
Schoolcraft you find that mayhem where hollows holler in the AM
Gratiot where grandma's stayin'
Neighborhood that's decayin'
Niggas pockets is light so that light bill they're never payin'
So fam don't let your lips talk, that could be your pitfall
And get you sprayed on like murals on side of brick walls
Dudes watchin' waitin' for you to get sloppy
Like a hitman lurkin' in the shadows with his shotty
Out here screamin' "Let's go", yeah my nigga X know
City where the TECs blow but we ain't talkin' techno

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Sino]
I'm stumblin' in my Detroit fitted, bitch
Anybody want some beef then we with it, bitch
Shit, see in the Mitten all my niggas 'bout that action
Might be 30 niggas with me, every nigga with me packin'
No fly zone, shit, just for pussies on that fuck shit
Dirty glove, boy this ain't the city to be fucked with
Shout out my uncle Trick, you get to trippin', he gon' dump quick
My city verses everybody (you gotta kill everybody!)
Boy, RIP to Blade, I hope he hear this
I swear if Ron was free, he'd be the first nigga to kill this
Street nigga, give me a ki and I'ma deal it
Better give a nigga his cash or you can feel it
What up Em, signed the city to Shady and fuck it
They say the world is a bitch, I'ma keep on fuckin' it
My city on my back and I'ma keep on runnin' it
Still got that chopper on the back seat, ain't shit sweet, boy

[Verse 6: Marv Won]
40287, I'm out that black bottom
If they don't fuck with the boy, I bet the crack got 'em
It's enough two faces here to attack Gotham
And ain't nobody a ho until the MACs spot 'em
Dot 'em, play possum, no brave option
All of mine yay choppin' and K shoppin'
The nerve this nigga here can play the part of a goon
Transplant your killers if it ain't no heart in the room
Wait 'til he sugar sharp and then throw salt in the wound
These red beams'll turn your white party maroon
I got a pair of gators that I hardly wear
Nigga I will kill you over these Cartiers
I got a couple bands with the dice on the floor
When I was 9, boy I could tell you the price of a bow
Listen, full length minks just to show we stuntin'
Brother you know it's nothin'
Nigga I'm Komen youngin', tell 'em!

[Hook]

[Verse 7: Payroll]
I'm from the west side blocks where we roll in spots
And have blow blowout sales to blow out a watch
Young niggas gettin' popped cause of the clique they claim
And in most homicides, it's a bitch to blame
My future plan's to stay froze 'til my wrist complains
If rap fails, I'm whippin' coke 'til the brick complains
In the new 6 switchin' lanes, probably with big kis
Ain't talkin' coffee when I say the trunk is where the big be
You see that D right above where my lid be
Can't trust a soul, well that's how these streets did me
I bossed up from setbacks by luck, I rep that
Ain't scared of nigga's shit, I'm from Detroit, I expect that

[Verse 8: Hydro]
Look I'm from Detroit, bitch
Where we crack heads and we break bails
Inspired by the dopeman that pack hammers and make sales
Dreaming of a rollie, a coupe, a crib off of late trails
They quick to take a trip with so much weight that it'd break scales
Young boys wilding, with a chopper they'll make hail
Screaming "fuck the cops" and quick to pop off like some fake nails
Shout out to my strippers with 30 inches and fake tails
And pounds of the cookie like I was running a bake sale
Holla if you need it, I got it, just come and ask the man
Try me and get cheddar on your hand just like a Packer fan
Riding down your mama street with tints on a blacker van
And turn your block into a war zone like we in Pakistan
Nobody I can call on, it's ball or get balled on
Wrists full of that shit you niggas can slip and fall on
Why the fuck you hating us when we can put them all on?
And they can help their little mans and they can hit the mall strong
It's 7 Mile 'till I die, raised by some street niggas
Fuck friends, ain't got none, I'm dolo with this heat, nigga
Boogers in my watch face, my wrists be looking slimey
Once I fuck she's like my seatbelt, I put that bitch behind me, nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 9: Big Gov]
My timing was perfect, designed to be worshiped
Like Jesus as a fetus
Was destined to earn my stripes like Adidas
Needless to say I'm the sniper
Pick us off, niggas soft
While they spitting bars in the middle of a cypher
I'm from the same hood as Big Meech and Big T
So miss me with ho shit or end up on this street
Home of the big three; big cuffs, big guns, big chips
Where broke niggas get hood rich off of quick flips
I'm from the city where the bitches even gangster
Suck a nigga dick, get her robbed, tell 'em thank you
We don't fuck with you outsiders, learn who to talk to
Or get stomped for feeling like the man when you walk through
And I don't even walk around with my chest out
But know it's drama when you see me with my vest out
My next route is finding out where you rest at
Catch you sleep, make the crime scene where you slept at
And the next cat who disrespect my city on some rap shit
I'm on his ass like cellulite on a fat bitch
This shit is drastic and you ain't gotta ask if
A nigga come disrespectful, he leaving out in a casket

[Verse 10: Boldy James]
Detroit VS everybody, that's me against the world
I might not sell a cop, but who need a brick or girl?
A thousand grams on my cock, later alligator
Moist of the aviator, cardi sipping activator
Never been a punk, faker or a lean whipper
Steady packing eighters in a one paper king swish
Concrete, definition of real street nigga
Whole hood know that I'm the only real D nigga
That really mean it when you hear me say I am Detroit
Can hear it in my voice, my fault Em and Royce
For being four days late turning my verse in
But me and Ready Rock was in the spot putting that work in
What was you doing before you ever touched your first ten?
I was in the streets with my peeps getting them chirps in
Text me when the work gone, I text him back the work end
Tryna get my hands on the pack when they first in
On my Captain Planet I possess earth, wind and fire
But you being a liar is the worst sin
Keep throwing rocks at the throne with a glass chin
I'm still that same nigga on the corner with a half grin
I never let these niggas use my ears for no trash cans
Been selling dope for too long, it's time to cash in
King James, before this rap shit I had street fame
And the keys to the city on my key chain

[Hook]

[Verse 11: Kid Vishis]
Whoever said Vishis phony, get to know me
Our hollows'll make a rapper drop the mic, no diss to Joey
Guns of all sizes, I fire and get smokey
Riding with the biggest ratchet on the car dash, I call it Khloe
You think you hard? I think you doughey
His guts'll fall out looking like someone stuck a knife in a stoagie
Homie, you owe me your life
I'm Columbine balling, throwing a stripe
Wiping you out and bounce like a thief in the night
I now control machinery, it's like real steel
Gun ductaped to the tires, that mean I will kill
They say I'm fooling to 'em
They asked me for a hot sixteen
So I lit my notebook on fire and threw it to 'em
Here's a DeJ Loaf punchline
I kill your whole family and leave a red trail, that's your bloodline
Try me, I bust nines
Stick a clock in his mouth and make him chew
Yeah, nigga, it's crunch time

[Verse 12: Big Herk]
We got them choppers, how a nigga with a knife gon' win?
Y'all just shooting the breeze, they done let a cyclone in
This what happen when little mama boys trapped grown men
Lyrically ahead of my time like the iPhone 10
And why Detroit always get a bad name?
My city ready to blow like we here to gas, mane
These niggas thinking they dope, but their shit a tad lame
Man, their pen and pad game more like Trinidad James
Fuck you and whoever you run with
I'm on that BS, I'm still in the middle with dumb shit
I'm a beast, everything you hear me spit real tight
Your flow wack, it's out of Egypt, nigga, it's real light (get it?)
I'mma keep it real, niggas can't fuck with me
It's like I contracted Ebola, they ain't touching me
Detroit VS Everybody, niggas know we started that
Now every city all across the world want a part of this

[Hook]

[Verse 13: Icewear Vezzo]
Street niggas smarter than Kwame, bustin' hardbody
Panorama fold up Porsche, let the car box me
I know niggas ain't sold shit, they did armed robberies
Rugrats buying out bottles and playing with old Tommy's
East side, come to the zone, that's where the lions play
Young niggas stepping on blow, that's where the tigers stay
In my hood the first of the month, that shit a holiday
These cemeteries meet their capacity every fathers day
Hit a lick, keep all the work, get the stolie back
Tell a jeweler don't say shit, just get the Rollie checked
If them niggas bump one lip then get your homies wacked
I swear that you knew my boss, bitch, I'm Tony Jack
Real shooters run in the trap with them choppers out
Heard them niggas bumping their gums, see what they talkin' 'bout
In a spot with so much syrup, this bitch a waffle house
Hit the pharma with so many scripts, could buy the doctors out

[Verse 14: Detroit Che]
I'm Detroit Che
I'm as sick as some syphilis, sicker than Detroit hate
If you come knocking then it's trick or treat
I call up Tricky, load that shit then let that trigger squeeze
That shit ain't sweet, I'm from the murder mitten
Never thought my friend would've been a murder victim
I'm in that van, I want revenge, I'm on some Kendrick shit
I'm pissed off like a mistle, his dick's soft, he's ticked off, he can't get shit hard
If you diss my city I will set it off with a motherfucking semi that's bigger than Big Sean
Our city is Marshall Mathers on Adderall
You better pray we not mad at all when them gats involved
With swisher cap, we're flicking your fucking city off
I'll bust your fucking noggin, you disrespecting my city, dawg
I'm queen Che been on the throne for a minute
Before the cypher I've been slicing dice, these hoes will admit it
Bitch, I'm Slim Shady, we louder than M80's
No, I'm just playing, hope he hears it, I'm just saying
I'm a renegade, pussy sweeter than lemonade
You'll never penetrate
DeJ, tell these bitches to try me, I'mma demonstrate
Vez, tell them that I got options, I'm a real estate
On them properties like monopoly
Detroit VS Everybody, I make a verse versus everybody
Fuck your city, no fly zone, nigga, it's Detroit Che versus everybody
Detroit vs everybody, it's Detroit vs everybody
Fuck your city, no fly zone, nigga, it's my city versus everybody

[Verse 15: Calicoe]
(I just have to talk shit for a minute, man
I have to get in my zone, man, huh
It's the going, going, back, back to Cali, Cali, to Cali Cali)
Cali Cali, that's where I get them cheaper at
Your number like my number, I need a number I can reach you at
Want my price, then you get a price, I want at least a stack
You pay my flight, then you pay your flight, I'll meet you back
Middle man in my own plug, I can teach you that
Detroit vs everybody, who could compete with that?
You thinking everybody zips slow cause they got a plug?
My nigga, everybody zips slow cause I'm showing love
So whenever you make a flip again just know I'm showing love
If cash die, I'm on the strip again, just know I'm throwing dubs
Big roochies on the Michelins, rolling A1 dubs
Mind on my money, fuck a nigga tryna hold a grudge
Them crabs in the bucket used to slow me up
And now I'm sitting at the top and it's lonely as fuck
Got 20 thousand for my red bottoms
Cause I was standing in this blood after I headshot 'em, nigga

[Verse 16: Diezel]
It's me, bitch
Mafia captain, OG, bitch
20 years, been Detroit vs whoever, nigga
The right hand to the hand that be gettin' niggas
Goon squad mafia, mobbin'
For this dirty mothafucka, where it's my home
And I love this mothafucka
So I stood on the front line, ready for one time
Duck some shots, and buck bled for my line
All for the love of the palm of the dirty glove
Every hood, every block, nigga one love
7 mile is the hood where I came up
Pray the game keep it and get your weight up
Bitch you better say us when you're talkin' 'bout next
Detroit niggas stood up when put to the test
Like what? Nigga, who? What the fuck
Anybody wanna do? We ain't hear shit
One army, one city, one sound
It's Detroit, gon' shut shit down
It's time to return the king his crown
Fuck who got next, nigga we got now[Verse 1: Chuck Inglish]
And it's falling off the side like back fat
Giving girls rides to the crib not a rat trap
Cheese, peanut butter freeze raps
I want all these snapped in his back in the day
Like a tall tee tag
I need that whip clean G
What's the weather gon be
Drop top, no drips on this upholstery
Supposed to be headed downtown
Carwash like blaow
And my girl drive the chevy while I break this tree down
Roll the window back up
Good, turn it back up
Ugh, UGK
Diamonds & Wood
Hold up, yea roll up
That's tight, that's right
You do this right, you might have the time of your life

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
Coming from the Westside but my fitted say Sox
Where you get banged on if you in it or not
Looking like Cain cause I watch Menace a lot
And I'm tryna fuck your friend so is she with it or not
Shout out to ATL cause I'm in Lennox a lot
And I dont like looking, I go in there to cop
Houston High Rollers, I go in it a lot
Spending money with the strippers you go in there to watch
Blowin on L's, smelling like Chanel
You say you the man but dawg these bitches can't tell
But ladies love Dom cause I'm gettin that mail
To make it out my hood is like to make it out of jail
Put the tens up and start breaking out the twelves
Bet I have your girlfriend shaking out her heels
We shaking all deals
And chasing all meals
I'm popping all over how you haters all feel

[Big Sean]
Smoke good, fuck better
Count money, what's better
These lil niggas can't hang
Big shit popping bitch and big my first name
I'm a Westsider, Detroit player
Fuck around and I might bring back gators
Everyday I leave the crib with no money
And come back later with that muthafucking paper
Finally famous over erything thats just how I feel bitch
They trying to stop my shine
They yellin hit the kill switch
Wrong nigga to deal with
Less you doing a deal with
Grind hard, thats how I was built bitch
Whoa there, whoa there
I'm who everybody know here
I come through in the club and get more money than promoters
Oh thats your girl
I see her at my show there
I be off in the hood I bet you dont ever go there
Ayy so slow there boy
Don't go there boy
It's people you dont know there boy
Young nigga that's addicted to the Polaroids
And I gave these niggas more lines than corduroy
And my bitches be gorgeous boy
Showtime I hope you record em boy
I'm out here

[Boldy James]
Let's reel half of a brick and bring it back to the kitchen
See the crack its fizzing
Then bring it back when its finished
Jimbo put that on a dish
And Chizzel will bag it and sell it
Then boldly factor the digits
To know the cash that I'm flipping
Six gonna get stashed in the ceiling
6-O's in traffic I'm pitching this o
That one get split and broke to halves
And this one his o
And that one is his
And this o I'm bagging and this one
This o the last
The nigga Ro is a crackilitician
Rolling the ave cause I'm getting dough in that slab
Cause I'm getting over, they mad
I just grill 'em bro, with my mag on my briches
Know I'll blast if you tempt him
Bro you will crash in your whip with holes in your back cause you hit
Going as fast as your engine go
When you smash in the strip smoking a bag with your bitch
Choking, gasping for breath holding
Grabbing your chest from boldly magging that tech
Unload it faster than Vick's concreture school craft to the the sick
Bomb as a brick

[Asher Roth]
I be frustrated with the way that shit's been aging
And I'm about to take a break and get away on a vacation
Like, maybe Malaysia to escape the meditation
I'll just eat, pray and wait for my day of revelation or I'll
Take peyote, roam the rivers of Nairobi
Change my name to Navajo and live alone and only grow weed
Cause this, Naomi flowing show gets pretty lonely
Don't nobody ever know you
Everybody call you homie
Mony Mony they'll be sure to treat you phony
As soon as you hit your low they won't be picking up the phone
See, I moved to (Comie ?) show these fools that I am home
And when Im on the microphone all you wanna-be's can blow me
So, take this boner to the dome you little bo-peeps
That may be inapropy but Im certainly no sheep
See, I only lead in this game of entertainment
Roth and Big Sean
We on Finally Famous

[Chip Tha Ripper]
Yea, now roll ten of em up
Fuck the rules we Auntie Anne's pretzel bendin em up
Don't give a fuck/Word to your daddy leather sandals
Either pay the light bill or light up them candles
Regular White Owl Cigarillo, no Flavors
Break that bitch down and peel of the first layer
Smooth, like a baby's ass
Mercedes pass
The ladies ask can they be next cause I'm kicking their favorite raps
Life is playing 2k and kicking raps all day by the lake
Smoking truth till I collapse in broad day
I'm surfing, radical
Gnarly, far out
My stoner chicks gather round soon as I break the jar out
Ay baby girl pass the blizz-ard
Your woman chose me so I had to jizz her
Don't be sleeping or taking no cat naps
We leaders of the new school with these fat raps[Hook]
Birds of a feather flock together and you winging it
Man this shit is for the birds and I need a brick
Quick, a 28 by 36
Man this shit is for the birds and I need a brick

Birds of a feather flock together and you winging it
Man this shit is for the birds and I need a brick
36 for the birds and I need a brick
Man this shit is for the birds and I need a brick

[Verse 1]
Blocks, I p-p-push it real good
In that salt and pepper Chevy with them woofers and them subs
On them spinderellas, I can hit the Kenwood
Remote and change the channel while I'm breaking down the bud
Smoking a perfecto, drinking on the bud
Finna roll another rello up and take it to the lungs
Pedaling that rego, racing through the slums
Pedal to the metal in a race against time
With nowhere to go but up, Bo on ?
Cause you damned if you do, I'm heading nowhere fast
And you damned if you don't, slow your role young man
'Fore you crash and you burn, I can't hold yo hand
Through this shit and ? better know yo ledge
Knowledge is the key to success, it's all in your head
Yea, to be or not to be, if you can see what I can see
As far as the eye can see, narcotic ?

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Got 'em for 25, get 'em for 17
How he expect to fly if he don't ever spread his wings?
4-5 Desert Eagle with the beam
He talk fly, shoot him out the sky, clip his wings
Over a bird of 'caine, run up in your bird nest
Put 'em in yo bird brain and yo bird chest
Over that pack
What's the sense of putting all of your eggs in one basket if they don't hatch
Mother Goose and the old lady who lived in a shoe
Lining all my ducks in a row, duck, duck, goose
Red Bull and Grey Goose mixed with champagne
What's good for the goose is good for the gander
Where they let 'em fly and throw bullets instead of tantrums
In the hood, on the stoop, where them pigeons landed
Got them fruit loops, Toucan Sam
And put yo ass six feet like the old Jordan Jams cause

[Hook][Boldy James]
I'm countin' gwap like a packed casino
In the coffee shop, whippin' cream up the cappuccino
Hubba rocks got the fiends runnin' back with singles
Chasin' a high they ain't seen since sellin' crack been legal
Facin' long vacations, out on bail, fresh out of jail
No laces in my number twelves
So anxious to blaze up this blil I've been savin' since county jail
Put on my street clothes, took off my county blues
Put on my free throws, kick off my shower shoes
Then threw my piece on, cut off my wristband
Then threw my freeze on, screw my ear ring in
Threw my two rings on, put on my C frames
Turn on my minute phone, cut on my NexTel
Threw my D fitted on, they call me King James Jones
It's writ' in stone
All my concreatures gettin' it on in the zone

[Hook 2x]
Ridin' down the street
Got cops on (3x)
Got cops on (2x)
Gettin flicked

[Boldy James]
Under the pale moonlight
You niggas never dance with the devil
State troopers behind you while you slam on the pedal
Gettin' in that Regal, hand on your metal (Gettin' Flicked!)
Magnum special, sandwich bag full of pebbles
And it's max if they catch you
It's real life shit this ain't Hansel and Gretel
In my kitchen, pyrex right next to the kettle
Open the cabinet, Farina right next to the pet milk
With my strap on the sink full of dishes and residue
Phone tapped I think and my minutes is hella low
Who in the hell would think that that kid would be sellin' dope
From petty thief, misdemeanors to federal
Seventeen in the clink for some weed in my Pelle coat
Never seen in the spee so the D's will never know
Where we keepin' the P's and them keys of perrico
Desert Eag in my jeans, lemon squeeze, I'll let it blow
If you ready to leave here the keys to heaven go

[Hook 2x]

[Boldy James]
Nah
Don't talk me to death
My aunties LaNette and Marsha accept
The charges when neph' had to call 'em collect
Them my concreature reps and they love me to death
Even though they say my head hard as a brick
In the precinct hoping that this fed charge don't stick
To my black ass, p-p-pedal down the foothill
Wheelies on the front, on the dyno with the black mags
Black mags, rhinos in my black mag
Black flag, red rag representin' brick slab, six flags
Seven six a pick, air, big bag, get cash
Sellin' niggas brick slabs, big halves
Seventeens and nick bags, McNair
Eagle with the clip stares
Whiplash, quick fast
Miss me with the riff raff
Bitch ass, kiss ass
Dick suckin' bitch mad
His bad, concreatures
Westside, let's ride

[Hook 2x][Verse 1: JMSN]
How you doing, how you been?
See you still got the same so called friends
But I ain’t judging, to me it’s nice
To know this is what you made your life

[Hook]
On the surface everything can look so nice
But if you meet the girl inside you might think twice
She’ll be your habit, yeah, your one and only vice
Don’t you know that everything you want comes with a price?

[Hook]
Girl I used to know
It’s been a minute since I’ve seen her
It’s been a minute since I’ve seen her
It’s been a minute since I’ve seen her
Girl I used to know
It’s been a minute since I’ve seen her
It’s been a minute since I’ve seen her
It’s been a minute since I’ve seen her

[Verse 2: JMSN]
Say what you want, say what you like
Her eyes will keep you up at night
No matter what you try to do
She’ll always have her hooks in you

[Hook]

It’s been a minute since I’ve seen her

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Boldy James]
She ain't the same, actin' all brand new
Things will never be the same, she ain't the girl I knew
It's King James, it's true
Concreature, first they love you
Then they hate you, then they love you again

The girl I used to know, just another face
It’s the classic mix up, honest mistake
Looking at her picture, sitting by the lake
Ain’t seen her in a minute but we still conversate
On a platonic basis, cause’ it’s complicated
You and your friends been had a bad reputation
If I’m not mistaken, only thing I was chasing
Was a dollar and a dream, just trying to make it
Difference ‘tween me and them, I’m a gangster
I admit you had me whipped, dominatrix
Had to flip the script, lot of time was wasted
My time is money and I don’t got the patience
I could be flipping bricks, I’d rather pound the pavement
With my Concreature congressmen congregating
Presidential shit, call it Obamanation
That’s big spit pimp soup, real conversation

[Hook][Verse 1: Boldy James]
They say its never rains in Southern California
But when you from a state where it's always snowin'
You tend to not believe the things that people tell you
Shit that I done seen please believe they gon' fail you
In your time of dire needs street dreams they gon' sell you
Take you to a place where can't nobody gon' help you
Or run to your rescue
I give respect where it's due
You, you only gonna do what I let you
Nigga don't let me catch you
With this Drew Bledsoe
And I look at you
Reaching for a gun you can't get to
Beat you to the stash
It don't matter what he grab when I flash
You can have drum on your pistol
Or a pack of machines stuffed full of SCUD missiles
With extended machines niggas gon' get they issue
By any means, shit, we more than official
Put you out of your misery
Have a morgue and it

[Hook: Boldy James]
Who do you believe in? (Me or them?)
Cause looks can be deceiving (So think again)
And I done been deceived
So it's a lot of things that don't sit right with me
So be easy (cool my dude)
Who do you believe in? (Me or them?)
Cause looks can be deceiving (When you me)
And by the looks of things this shit ain't what it seems nigga
Just give me a reason

[Verse 2: Vince Staples]
Bullets holes in Momma whip
7 chrome in my Momma couch
Watchin' the way I'm walking before they run in my Momma House
Baby bro with the problems, I promise he'll never talk it out
Grammar school I draw on the lines, was born to chalk them out
5-0's from the G-Unit in the raid van, but I seen through it
Got a deuce 5 and the skate highs, that was 10th grade back in 09'
Got a .45 soon as Nitty died, on the North side banging 65
I don't give passes, back-back and shit-bag I'm shit drastic
Piss-poor so I skip classes, still got on them Jays though
No problem nigga, I pop a nigga to get the shit that he paid for
Brown bandana sittin' on my face, I'm a Yannc ho
Got a black bitch from Bompton down to spank hoes
Never hit the court room, stayin' with that Drake flow
Trying to get that Drake dough, livin' where he started at
Eight ain't got no hammer just blam 'em ain't gotta cock it back
Boy

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Boldy James]
After the first time it's pretty much a piece of cake
So if you ain't 'bout this life you probably can't relate to it
If you were silver spoon fed back in '88
I had to eat with my hands out of paper plates
Made my great escape
Satan's greatest trick was convincing the world that he didn't exist
So meet the man out the myth, the devil in the flesh
Hell block, drugs zone seven six Detroit Michigan
We the new Bangladesh, the source and the fear
I need a new weigh connect (trey six)
To give em to me for the two way
But of course that depends on if you make it back
? have you ever perhaps been in a trap so hot you couldn't relax?
Sweatin' bullets, hunnit shots in a TEC
Gotta crook in my neck and it ain't no lookin' back

[Hook][Intrp]
Bronze Nazareth
What's good my dude
Concreatures
Sig-Sauer boys
40 blocks
227

[Verse 1]
It's no success without struggle
That's why I hustle
Free Meechie and the fam
Thinkin' about what my cuzzo told me, this a jigsaw puzzle
And the pieces of a man is in the heart of the humble
Reach down and dig and you can tell who love you
Deep down within, unconditionally, unintentionally
If I gotta carry a gun every time we do a deal
Then there's trust issues with me, we agree to disagree
That's the difference between you and me
Anybody can be touched, some easier than others
We all we got and I'm my brother's keeper
We supposed to be brothers
Finders keepers, the life of a Concreature
It's losers weepers, move your feet or lose your seat
Ever since when fish ride bicycles

[Hook]
They like who that Concreature cool kid?
Ain't it obvious that he the coolest, cool it
He cold chillin' and krush groovin', coolin'
He the meanin' of what cool is, cool then
Cause cool is what cool does
And he was schoolin' y'all niggas on the schoolbus, foolin'
But don't get him confused with this music and do something stupid, doofus
He got ones and twos with checks and swooshes
Up next it's the honorary cool kid
One fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish
From black mags on the dino to a moped
Sunkissed movements jellyfish blowfish
In the Pyrex pot full of goldfish
One sip, two spliffs, three bricks, four trips
When fish ride bicycles go fish

[Verse 2]
No sin is greater than the next
Cause your own fam will play you to the left
When you do wrong for all the right reasons
The same niggas you feed will cater 'til your death
Impostors, they hate what they can't conquer
So they label you a threat
When they don't understand what angle you comin' from
They anglin' their guns at somebody momma ?
So respect who respect you
Until he disrespect you, then you show him otherwise
In a house of pain I became a man when I put aside my childish ways
And trust in the lord
If a man knows anything he realizes he knows nothing at all
It's just the luck of the draw, it was God who shuffled the deck
I'm just cuttin' the cards

[Hook][Verse 1: Asher Roth]
Y'all done fucked up now
Y'all sucked the sun out this motherfucker
Looking like one dark cloud
We been off for a while
But we just geting started
Let that feeling rub off right now
I'll say shit out loud, and you aren't really retarded
You just wanna go along with the crowd
It's ok, don't pout - we're not breaking the law
We gonna sort it all out right now
I'm in the mode of you gotta go hard and trust no one
Sleeping on the floor, cause homie, you never know when
You lay low, stay low, and keep firing
Cause you know it's lame as soon as you hear sirens
Move in silence but be all ears
Don't listen to the talk because it's all fear
It's right here, it's thoughts, it's idears
It's off the Mark Walberg dog, it's our year
Let's start the party, Hoorah and ah yeah!
All we need is some mid ? and malt beers
I be jumping up on chairs
Telling everybody I'm the brand new Paul Revere, like

[Hook]
Only the truth gets spit...

[Verse 2: Boldy James]
All my guns got hairpin triggers
You Spongebob Squarepants, yellow-bellied niggas who square dance
Don't stand a chance against my concrete
You Taliban when them doors slide on that caravan
No more Mr Nice Guy, feel my wrath
Cause nice guys always finish last
Say hello to the bad guy, goodbye
Catch the holy ghost when I get you baptized
And prayed over, it's nap time
Tec 9, hollow tips, bottle cap size
And give you a makeover: flatline
For them 9s, them splits, and them halftimes
Last time you see a bad guy like me
Icy with a mag under my white T
Hook, line, sinker, cast iron
Reppin the ?[Intro: Boldy James]
Boldy blocks (How are you?)
227 (Only us)
Concreatures (Game time)
Hell block (Mafia)
Detroit (What else?)
Let's Get it

There's some hoes in this house (Go!) X3
That's my five dolla ho
There's some hoes in this house (Go!) X3
How much I gotta blow?

[Verse 1: Boldy James]
I'm working out that bag that you wish you had your hand in
Lying in your raps about some shit me and my man lived
Back when I was coming up, hits me and my fam did
Nigga you was never one of us, you was hand fed
Paying 40 for the lean and niggas on they last leg
I keep that .40 with the beamer, don't have 40, ask Viz
How I'm cut? My niggas drilling
Don't believe me? Ask Dez
Shot him up and didn't kill 'em, but I left him half dead
Woke up out that coma, popping SOMAs, on his death bed
Got up on his good foot and hopped up on his bad leg
Cause bullets fly and numbers don't lie, this a math quiz
If you get that bag in, can I get an ad-lib?
Yeeeeaaaaah
Me and Yankee cracking crab legs
Up in locals now we up in Strokers
And that ass so fat I need a lap dance
Hamiltons and Jacksons
Came with two, I gave her 20, she gave me back 10

[Hook: Boldy James]
Ma, I just gotta know
How much I gotta blow
How much i gotta throw at a five dolla ho (Let's Get it)
Ma, I just gotta know (Whoa!)
How much I gotta blow (Ok)
How much i gotta throw at a five dolla ho

There's some hoes in this house (Go!) X3
That's my five dolla ho
There's some hoes in this house (Go!) X3
How much I gotta blow?

[Verse 2: Problem]
I ain't scared of a nigga, I ain't regular quick
Got workout, squad a helluva fit
Boy bird fly on some pelican shit
Little bitty nigga with an elephant dick
And these niggas' hoes be loving it
Pull up, shut it down like the government
Banging my gang out in public
And punch a mark nigga for the fuck of it
I'm on that, out the hood and ain't going back
Don't sweat the past cause that's going back
Say "yes" to cash and y'all knowing that. What?!
No root when I flow it, count the poet, y'all know it, I done did the due
On the track, on my toes like a running shoe
Stay grounded like when your mamma punished you
I'm 100 proof
No matter how you feel about it
Paper never chill about it
If it doesn't count or mean another comma in bank
Money, we can't live without it, but I gotta keep it solid
Just because I'm getting it, don't mean a ???? ain't a thing
But the way I move, I got it, five kids and counting
You feel me?!
But Imma live this way 'til God or a young bitch nigga come kill me
What?!

[Hook: Boldy James]

[Verse 3: Jarren Benton]
Gotta get some hoes in this house
"All Gold Everything"
When you give me head bitch, keep them golds in your mouth
Weird ass nigga from the eastside
When we pull up on you fuck niggas, bitch you know what we 'bout
Rappers sound dead in a brand new Bugatti
Murder everything ????
Throwing up the A, nigga magna cum laude
Gotta a trust fund for the kids, muthafuck Versace
Yeah, shit I'm done with these fools
Who the fuck said getting money ain't cool?
I been broke bitch, I couldn't feed my kids
I ain't going back nigga, shit I'm done with that blues
Feel God when I beast on a tune
These niggas more pussy than Reese Witherspoon
If she bust it open she can get the keys to my room
If you say my name wrong that can lead to your doom
Yeah, nigga word to Big Pun
I told a bitch I'm in the game like Tron
I ain't got the crown yet, but you can call me the king
I be damned, swear to God, man, I feel like one
I learned to adjust to complications
I'm 'bout to progress my situation
Fuck niggas must be the new Cool Kids
That's all I see, these niggas still hating

[Hook: Boldy James][Intro/Outro]
I sold dope all my life
With the deuces dropping
Sixty-twos in pots
Getting to the profits
Solid to a liquid, liquid to a solid
What you know about it?
I sold dope all my life
Yeah, yeah, now what's a hundred thousand?

[Verse 1]
Here we go again: niggas hearts droppin'
To their feet. On the strength, I'm a hard-rocker
From the D', blowing gans, sipping hard vodka
Selling weed, throwing my mag in your broad's locker
Went on the street, going ham with them armed robbers
Doing me, on the crab(?) with my dog, Papi
Uncle Keith was the man with the false-bottom
WD-40 cans full of narcotics
Fronted me a couple grams, then I start copping
From a three to a half when I saw a profit
Put a G in my grandmother's hall closet
Running the streets with my fam', niggas caught bodies
Fucking with me and my mans, then I lost Swali(?)
He never did shit to nobody but them boys shot him
We hold court in the street, how we resolve problems
I practice what I preach, you niggas false prophets

[Refrain]
Bold and cold, living like
I don't know wrong from right
And despite, nig'
I sold dope all my life
On the coldest of nights
Rolling stoned on my bike
In my Nik's, nig'
I sold dope all my life
Blow your nose, hit the pipe
Poke a ho, take a flight
To new heights, nig'
I sold dope all my life
Boldy on with the white
On the phone at the light
Make a right, nig
I sold dope all my life

Bold', stay on your grind
When you cut dimes
No eights or two-for-nines
For them nick's
Tote tre tools or nines
With rubber grips
No safety on mines
What it is
48219
Is my zip code
Whole cake's 215
For the big one
The four weigh 1-25
Of that yeah-buddy, no shake, 2.9
For the spliff pop you gon' pay 1.5
The zips go for 8 and sometimes 9
For the happy taffy Bold' will take four one time
The next time my phone ring, I'm gone on five
Them quarters 250, for you 225
Them (?) 150, for you 125
'luminum, boil in 'em 16s for 75
And I'm charging 50 for .7, my guy
It's Concreatures

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
Bruh, these niggas can't fuck with me
Like I can't have company
Comf'tably
Feet kicked up under the money tree
No more reggie seed
Nickle, dimes, and quarters
We rolling up them killer grams
Little Shop of Horrors
Concrete, Hill block Detroiter
Standing over the kitchen sink
With a hot pot of boiling water
Smoking a swisher sweet
Finna drop a quarter soft for
The deuce and a quarter but
I can knock a quarter off it
Went from a deuce and a quarter
To a four and a half
And my deuce and a quarter
With a 'bow and a half
Half the time drunk
Pouring up a cup of 'yak
On the run, flats(?) cuz rolling up a loudpack
If I ain't in the hood, tell me where the hood at
I'm on my block selling drugs, posted like a thumbtack
Tactical command, no taking a stand
And ain't no weak links in my chain of command
It's Concreatures

Bold and cold, living like
I don't know wrong from right
And despite, nig'
[Intro/Outro][Intro]
Yeah
Blocks
227

[Verse 1: Boldy James]
It's Concreatures, 'til I can't say it no more
With my Concreatures, interstate straight to the O
Rental car spinning with a cake taped in the door
I'm hitting your region, whipping h, weed and the blow
With my door, eat a nigga stay blazing the joe
I'm blazing the dro, while he play the Playstation
With my Macky on my lap, while the k in the floor
Stuffing baggies full of crack rock and yay on the stove
Just so happened I can rap and it's taking it's toll
The way that I'm ?, concreatures breaking the mold
The way that we roll, some gotta give on the up and up
Cause I got a deal to move this big o ain't nothing up
I ain't gotta deal, and them pigs know it's something up
But I'm not these niggas in this biz for a couple bucks
I got some niggas doing bids over 100 plus, plus I shot a nigga as a kid for 100 bucks

[Hook]
Throw yo 7's high, throw yo 6's low
If you from 7 mile, or McNichols road
Drug Zone, 6 mile raised
7 mile paid, neighbor gang (x2)

[Verse 2: Boldy James]
Just before the paragraph I indent with intent
Slung a quarterback and a half, six time what I spent
2 Deuce and a quarter with reds riding Envy's with tints
Young Detroiters gettin' cash, I extended my clip
Six and Hill block. Little Quarter mags and  swiss
Six to twelve shots, chilling on the crab with bricks
We still got quarters, halves and zips
350 for quarters, halves for 6
We still rock quarters, bagging nicks
Who pill popper snorting drags of this?
We deal spots, corners, aves and strips
We deal spots, corners, halves and scripts
I still cop quarter bags of chips
Used to steal pops from stores, bad as shit
I still quarts and halves from Chip
The deal block scorching ashy nick and ripple
On Hell block pouring Yac with Rec and Little
An deal cops who want my last and middle initial
To cell blocks with all my Stabs and Beans, We miss you
It's Hell block Boldy Chap from West McNichols

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Boldy James]
It's 4 quarters in a O
64 in a boat
36 a quarter crow
Brick of blow on 44
Times seven that's a brick
Miles 7 to the 6
Curtis Curve Curve
South Veal Service Drive
[Hook]Killin' the 5th as we smoke up the quarter
Feeling refreshed as a cold cup of water
Hittin' my chest, you the best and I can't lie
So don't be shy, open wide, baby say aah
Girlfriend ain't the first lady I made cry
I hurt her feelings but first I made her say aah

[Verse 1]
Oooh lala, imagine your wildest dreams coming true, voila
What it do mama, you got that ill na na
Foxy Brown, mixed with a lil Zsa Zsa
Wipe me down in the impala
No Benihana, Coach, Fendi, Prada
Just a whole lotta screamin' and hollerin'
And the thing about it I didn't need a dollar
Holla if you feel me mama
I know you kinda shy but I'mma get that out ya
Tried to told her before the night was over
I was gon get up out her now I got her open
Moanin', I be strokin'
Hittin' yo bay in a wave-like motion
Killin' it
Got her drippin' sweat
I know her man can twist he runnin' in the west
Or get it wet but I get it wetter
Niggas done hit before but I can hit it better
It's my pleasure

[Hook]
Killin' the 5th as we smoke up the quarter
Feeling refreshed as a cold cup of water
Hittin' my chest, you the best and I can't lie
So don't be shy, open wide, baby say aah
Girlfriend ain't the first lady I made cry
I hurt her feelings but first I made her say aah
I break hoes in half before I say bye
I Trey Songz they ass and make 'em say aah

[Verse 2]
Fuckin' sackchaser
When we fuck I put her in the back breaker
And break her, left her gasp faced
When she cum she run because she can't take it
Face it, I'm the best baby
One on one, she love me cause the sex crazy
Sweet lady, would you be my sweet love for a lifetime
Grind, it should be a crime
My hunny my bunny I love her cause the bitch crazy
But she mines, that's my baby
And she fine as wine, drive me crazy
Out my mind, that's my pastry
After we wine and dine, that's my danish
Down to ride, on the Daytons
In the trap with the stars and them straps, she Famous
Barker, Travis bang

[Hook][Intro]
I'm ready
Bold face James

Tell these watch they mouth if they want they teeth you hear me?

Drugzone
227
Niggas know what it is with me

[Verse 1]
Boldy blocks, Bend Street, king of the skelly
In the jelly, whipping s'ghetti getting so much fetti
Call me Soda Popinski or 'chine Gun Kelly
From Kelly to telly in my soda club pelle
On the block, 10 deep, three five seven
One dessi, two 'chetes, and my throwaway peggy
If the police try to flick me, I'm fleeing
When they catch me they goin' hit me with a netty
So you know it ain't petty
You know it ain't reggie
You knew you wasn't ready
If you hit me, better catch me, you know I ain't friendly (at all)
Like Casper, you know I ain't friendly
And friendly got a stash, now I'm ghost with my friend Lee
In the Jag blowing smoke with a 10 piece
Graduated from semipro to the big leagues
Had to let them know what the six meant
That's where I'm at, here I go, come and get me

[Hook]
In no time
It's been a longtime coming for a longtime
It's been a longtime running from a longtime
Kept the phone lines jumping like a telethon
In the blowspot putting out that topside
Spent my whole life thugging in the sunshine
With my .45 ducking from the one time
It's been a longtime running from a longtime
It's been a longtime coming, had a long run

[Verse 2]
Fell asleep with my finger on the trigger
That's a real street dream, why you sleeping on a nigga?
Never me slipping, reaching for the blick again
Peeled, sweet dreams, you sleeping with the fishes
In the creeks, send a finger to your Mrs
And the meal, can't let them get the drop on me
Call me what you want, just don't call the cops on me
Or call me collect at the spot homie
(Hello? Who is this? Where the fuck is Boldy?
Dawg working with the feds, trynna put them on me)
Got popped with a brick and some mark money
Got off with intent, did a 1 to 20
For snitching on my cuddy, nigga had it coming to him
I fell off, but bounced back like Silly Putty (Big Dummy!)
I risked fed time for this money
It's concreatures
Hellblock, hully gully

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
When my back is against the wall
What happens if it should fall?
I live for today, but pray for a better tomorrow
Crack is against the law
What happens if you get caught?
For selling that yay? And they send you behind the wall?
Why would you risk it all?
Moochie, I've been through it all
Might as well give it all to me, I can move it all
Magical with the wand, don't panic when it dissolve
That's just its purest form, no additives but the Arm and Hammer
When whip it hard, the hammer is a revolver
Jam it like that's my song, they play it in rental cars
Traffic and bricks of raw, bird play, chicken talk
I know Sergei and I ain't talking Fedorov
Niggas with jealous hearts turn state, tip you off
Don't even know what a chirp weigh, or what it costs
After a get it off, first base, second, walk
Stole third base, heading home, finna score a homerun

[Hook]
