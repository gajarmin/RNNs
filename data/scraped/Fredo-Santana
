[Hook: Fredo Santana]
These niggas changed, they got jealous on me
Try to rob, I got that felon on me
I can't leave the country cause I'm a felon homie
And I don't trust these niggas, they be telling on me
And I don't trust these bitches, they be plotting on me
Everybody ain't real, you gotta watch homie
Niggas say they real, but they acting funny
These niggas changed and got jealous on me

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
I don't trust these niggas, I don't trust these bitches
Drunk right now, so you know I meant it

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
If you know me then you know nigga Chi-town like my second home
I done flew a private jet for some Harold's Chicken straight from Rome
I done bust down on a few thots, Fredo hit me on my phone
"Nigga I can't talk right now, got pussy on my tongue"
I got worry on my brain, I been gone all summer
Just to fly back home and found out y'all done killed my little brother
Shit is fucked up on these streets
Why the fuck would I think about some rap beef?
Nigga I got bigger fish to fry now
Empty out my account and I'll pay for sleep
Where's my bottle?
Money change and people change and people come
And people go and act estranged
I'm aggravated cause they hated, confirmation for success
Anticipated, I can taste it
I can chase it back down with liquor
I could drown out my sorrows
But I ain't a sorry ass nigga
Get up off your ass, make yourself a hundred racks
Bitch, get up off your ass, throw it back back back
Back inside my 'Bach, back in a garage that we can jack
Bitch I love my hood, I'm strapped up, what's good?
Heard someone said

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Fredo Santana]
Coming up, gotta watch who you hang with
I'm still with the same niggas I came with
On the block with the same niggas I banged with
If you ain't talking money I don't know your language
I come from that very very bottom
Now I'm getting money and I'm seeing stardom
My niggas savage, don't start 'em
We up them guns, if it's a fucking problem
Money coming in, don't have money problems
Kicked your bitch out cause she ain't wanna swallow
All these bitches thots, acting like models
Fredo, I'm the king of Chicago
Gotta .30 and I fill it up with hollows
Got bricks and I feel like El Chapo
I'm the shit, I'm the shit, I'm the shit bitch
Since I'm a rich nigga, I need a rich bitch

[Hook][Intro]
Pass me my double cup, where my double cup?
Where the fuck is my double cup?

[Hook]
So much money coming in, I ain't worried about the next nigga
Bricks came in, got a young nigga flexin'
Flexin' so hard got me feeling like a wrestler
Heard you want some lean, then you know I'm finna tax you
Asking dumb questions, what you want to get slapped or something?
Stressing like a motherfucka just pass me the double cup
I ain't worried about what you said, just pass me the double cup
Ain't hear what you talkin', pass me my double cup

[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning, roll me about four blunts
Brush my teeth, then I reach for my double cup
Bitch I reach for my double cup, call my shooters barbers cuz they'll line you up
All my niggas savage up, you don't want war with us
No goofy shit them rachets tucked
Goofy nigga actin' up, heard yo ass broke as fuck boy get yo trap up
Nigga tried to rob me, know I got my pistol tucked

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I think them drugs kicked in
Coolin' with some bad bitches, finna pop some xans
Don't go no where without my bands
Now a days you can't even trust your own friends
Niggas snakes niggas fake shrimp and steak on my dinner plate
Middle fingers to the game
Promethazine and codeine got me drinking all this pain away

[Hook][Produced By: HurtBoyAG & TrapMoneyBenny]

She talk always, she always gettin slapped

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Capo]
They like Cap why you spend that money like that, that's always

And if you wanna smoke fuck nigga you can get it the hard way
Gotta ride with my Glock

If I see dem opps that's always
And shoutout to Zaytoven
Ain't get my earrings yet
Or my watch, but til then my neck frozen
Aye look bitch, I'm holdin'

Top from your bitch that's always
Somebody poppin' out the club
This Doowop with a mop and he spark in broad day

[Hook][Hook]
Get some top from a thot while I’m cooling in the kitchen

People looking for me, I’m always in the kitchen
Early in the morning, I’m always in the kitchen
Late night shit, man I’m always in the kitchen
Always in the kitchen, man I’m always in the kitchen

[Verse 1 – Troy Ave]
Always in the kitchen cooking motherfucking powder
Forty eight hours later, still ain’t take a shower
Wash my nuts and my armpits, wipe my ass
Ironically, that’s what the fuck you call a birdbath
Smelling like cash, most of them be the hundreds
The name is Troy Ave, I’mma just keep it 100
Every day is stacks, off the yay and crack
Every day I’m strapped
I just left the kitchen just to lay this track

[Hook]

[Verse 2 – Fredo Santana]
Whipping up this work like a motherfucking slave
Fuck what you’re saying, I’m just tryna get paid
Everybody know me, neighborhood know my name
You can ask the fiends, I even took change
Put my mask on, I ain’t tryna show my face
Got two felonies, I don’t need another case
Your baby mama choosing but I only want her face
You ain’t tryna top a boss, get up out this place

[Hook][Verse 1 – Gucci Mane]
Turn me onto a big enough lick and Imma learn to love you
Put that chopper in your name so I got to fuck you

I fuck with Hollywood court but ain’t no Hollywood nigga

[Verse 2 – Fredo Santana]
Riding round LA with my new bitch
Counting blue face hundreds, count a few licks
Hit the trap, bounce, whip a few bricks
Baby fall back, you know I does this
Think it’s all fun and games, just music
Till a nigga pull up, get to shooting
Fredo ain’t getting money, man that’s nonsense
On Front Street, got the trap jumping

Or I'mma be at his crib the next day
With a big K, a big K
Shoot his momma in the mothafuckin' face
In the trap, whippin' work like a slave
In the hood, my lil' niggas can't behave
Chest shot, or the neck, or the face
Put an opp nigga in his fuckin' grave

Sosa say he want him dead, he die today
Got a 30, I just bought a big K
It's ok, it's ok

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Fredo Santana]
Sneak dissin', get found the next day
Stretched out, bullet holes from my K
It ain't my birthday, but I got a lot of cake
Try to take it and I'm shootin' you in the face
In the trap, with the squad, movin' weight
White bitches sniff a raw up off the plate
I don't trust niggas, lot of niggas fake
When I'm on your ass, ain't no escape
Try to run, I ain't worried, bullets chase
I just went and bought a big K
It's ok, it's ok
I just went and bought a big K

[Hook][Hook]
In the trap house whippin' bricks
In my closet, there go bricks
In my dresser, there go bricks
On the floor, there go some bricks
Bricks, bricks, damn I love them bricks
Bricks, bricks, damn I love them bricks
Brokes can't get no money
Goddamn, that makes no sense
I'm rich, I'm gettin' all this money
Goddamn, I'm off these bricks
Bricks, bricks, damn I love them bricks
Bricks, bricks, damn I love them bricks

[Verse 1]
Money talk and I be talking to them bosses
Take a trip to the bank, goddamn I love deposits
And I can't fuck with you if you on that opp shit
When it's beef, I'm shootin' at you whenever you are a coward
Trap house whippin' bricks
Finna pour me up a six
Tell the squad with the shits
Don't make us do a hit
Rap game trap game, same thang, still slangin'
(?) a nigga rob and I got a lil' fade
Can't never let no thot, can't get no clout on my name
Heard a nigga sneak dissing, guess he wanna be on the front page
You ain't 'bout no money, then we ain't on the same page
And I ain't getting along with yo ass, got rich off cocaine

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Twelve years old when I first started hustlin'
Kept it low key, didn't even tell my mother
I can't trust her, everybody undercover
Paranoid, switching phones and changing numbers
Fake niggas make me sick
My trap house made me rich
I'm in love with money, never love a bitch
Same game, still the same
Never change, fuck no change
Still sellin' in my trap, middle finger to the rap game
You know I'm in the kitchen, whippin' up a whole thang
Only savages in the squad, we don't fuck with no lames
Smokin' on that gas pack, you can call it propane
Just got some top from a thot and I ain't even know her name

[Hook][Hook]
Man I came up from nothing
Turned nothing into something
Now my money steady coming
Man I'm chasing after money
Man I came up from nothing (4x)

[Verse 1]
Chasing after money I don't love no bitch
Only thing I love, Saran wrapping bricks
New plug, new connect, on the road taking trips
I'm chasing after money 'till my feet fall off
I'm headed to the top, I could never fall off
You say you want it hard, but I can give it to you soft
Make sure your family straight, the first step in being a boss
Sneak dissin', that shit get your head knocked off
Four in the morning and I'm still serving raw
Coming up you'd be surprised what I saw
Niggas dying every day where I'm from
Pulling up, black trucks with loaded guns

Should I buy some bricks, shit that is not a question
Finna fuck your bitch then I might buy her a necklace
Stay up in your lane boy, that is my suggestion
Before you be stretched out in a new (?)
Popping bottles in my section with bitches I be textin'
One night these hoes gone loves these hoes, Fredo keep it pimpin'
In Chicago in my condo gettin' top from plenty women
In the kitchen with the fort, yea, I'm makin' trap decisions
One hand with the Glock, man you know I handle business
Trapped out in my trap spot, I can show you how I'm livin'

[Hook:]

[Outro:]
And that's just the intro
(?) Street Savage squad shit
My nigga big boss Fredo
DJ Lowkey what up
It's the Hood Rich-Savage Squad connection[Hook: Fredo Santana]x2
No sleep, 24 hours, that's that clockwork
On the grind every day, that's that clockwork
Can't stop, keep goin', that's that clockwork
That's that clockwork, that's that clockwork

[Verse 1: Fredo Santana]
Go all the way back when I was a young nigga
Got my first pack, fell in love with drug dealin'
I was hungry and thirsty, and I'm still is
That's why I grind hard like I got six kids
New car, new house, that's what them bricks did
New jewelry, new kicks, what them licks did
I was born fucked up, wasn't a rich kid
Just a young hustler, that know how to flip shit
When that work come in tan like Bisquick
That's when you know you got some strong A1 shit
When that work come in tan like Bisquick
That's when you know you got some strong A1 shit

[Hook: Fredo Santana]

[Verse 2: Lil Herb]
Six o'clock, jammin' bags, that's that clockwork
M.O.B., fuck a bitch, I put the block first
In the trap, fuck a job, that's where I work
On that eight, pushin' weight til' my arms hurt
And this bezel on my wrist, it makes my arms hurt
No conversation, I got this 30 I'mma spark first
Hittin' off this AK, took an old bitch, gotta catch my guard first
Niggas want me dead but Duwop gon' blow, we just hope this Glock work
Now back on the block, tryna get this gwap, nigga that's that clockwork
Roll up in them cars, tryna slide on the Opps, nigga that's that clockwork
And you better not snooze when we pull up on you, better hope that clock work
My niggas pullin' 24's, ride tinted windows, 50 shots in them choppers

[Hook: Fredo Santana][Hook]
Comin' up, I had roaches mouse in my crib
Swear to God, I ain't neva had shit
Man, I came up from the bottom
Came up from the bottom
Came up from the bottom
Man, I came up from the bottom
Hundreds in my right, hundreds in my left
Try to rob me, I swear to God you get left
Cause I came up from the bottom
Came up from the bottom
Came up from the bottom
Man, I came up from the bottom

[Verse 1]
Drinkin' lean out the bottle, cause today I'm feelin' great
Got this 30 on me, don't make me put it in yo face
Cause I came up from the bottom, you kill for em dollas
Put it on my momma, man, I swear I'm chasing gwala
R.I.P. to my homies, lot of niggas be phoney
Hopin I fall off, I tell 'em wait on it
Cause I came up from the bottom, sellin' dope in the projects
Juggin' and finnessin', doin whateva get profit
Savage squad my squad, we go to war with the country
I'm so cool with this cool on my mac
I swear to God it get ugly
All my bitches they love me, all yo bitches dusty
I came up from the bottom, I swear i neva had nuttin'

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Hundreds bitches on my dick, 30k up on my wrist
Came up from the bottom, I ain't neva had shit
Can't forget first time when I learned how to whip
Seen that shit, ain't been right since
Came up from the bottom, yo ass a get slaughtered
If it get serious, kidnap yo mamma and daughter
Shootin' .30s at yo apartment, catch you lackin' at yo garbage
These niggas ain't with the shits, I swear to God they imposters
Flexin' on these bitches, you can ask yo baby momma
Went from eatin noodles baloney, now Im eatin steak and lobster
Lot of niggas snitchin', man they talkin' to the coppers
Ever since a yung nigga been runnin' afta dollas

[Hook]
