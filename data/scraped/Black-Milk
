[Intro]
Don't you ever forget. Don't you ever take sides with anyone against the family. Do you hear me? Ever

[Hook: Dej Loaf]
Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (static)
I swear I love my city, I just want a little (static)
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (static)
Detroit vs. Everybody

[Verse 1: Trick Trick]
What up doe, everybody? I'm Detroit
So it's me vs. everybody if you ain't Detroit
We all hood, we love the gun smoke
A message from air traffic control
I'm doin' them niggas bold
Takin' it back to when rappers got beat up out their clothes
Treat 'em like little hoes
Used to wake up to snitches swingin' from light poles
When the booger shook took a light those
Shout out to every nigga that ever made money over in Brightmoor
With the white folks, in the window like a psycho
Puttin' the perfect play together, maestro
And since it's so cold in the D, if you don't come to see me
You might fuck around and see a nigga ice go
Had a lil' homie, run up on him with a knife though
Aiight ho, watch the big homie on the roof with the rifle
Who might go loco and shoot for nothin'
Will go postal with you for somethin'
And I'm willin' to give it to keep the counterfeits up out of my city
Ask around and they all know Tricky
Still pull it together for the kitty
Pour a little liquor for Biggie
And Frank Nitty on the Mickey, send 'em to Diddy
Tried to get me a spot on the Revolt
Switch a man's past from the revolt
Touchin' mothafuckas with the remote
Think your man sleepin' out here but nigga please, he woke

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Dej Loaf]
Ayo east side, raised on that east side
When we just throw our pinkies up along with the peace sign
Fairview street sign, who the fuck are these guys?
Niggas want war, we make 'em feel it, touch their G spot
My grandma sold pies and I ain't talkin' 'bout no key lime
Junkies at the side door, make sure that ain't 5-0
They done set her up, they done hit her with that combo
They done let the dogs out, house smellin' like Pine Sol
That was on the north end, I was on the porch then
Grandma what you cookin' up? Grandma why that fork bent?
Grandma where my mom at? Now I want her, beep her up
Always imagined we was poor and that her feet was up
Jordans, yeah we had 'em on, bitch it wasn't no teasin' us
Remember me and Pooh was in the window eatin' peanut butter
Damn I miss my cousin, I'm like R.I.P. to Trina's son
I'm from where it ain't no love, everybody need a gun

[Verse 3: Guilty Simpson]
Detroit V.S. everybody, P.S
Fuck y'all too, we don't care what y'all do
Still, you can't deny the real
Time reveal, society squeals and the society kill
Money motivated though we take it
These cats are overrated, severely, poppin' up yearly
Then they disappear within the same year
Like it never happened, them niggas just rappin' barely
I'm a shooter, loadin' my magazine and throw the book at 'em
Like a prosecutor, the Glock'll do you like a college tutor
Cause right after class
I teach a mothafucka somethin' and watch him pass
Graduation, I rattle cages
We make some uncomfortable, I didn't grow up like the Huxtables
West 7th where those drugs'll move nonstop
Soft white or hard rock, get everybody in your yard shot
You'll get a feel for my city when I send the welcoming committee
With the 50 calibers and the smoke grey Dodge Challengers
You frown on your face, we'll kick it pretty
When I grip the semi, you better have some grip to give me
Or the steel smokes, you cats are real jokes
You bitch niggas, smack your face numb like you feel coke
Until you get the big picture, mothafucka

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Black Milk]
Let the celebration kick off
This that point in the party where that person start pointin'
That pistol because they're pissed off
Shots lick off, fire spit off
This track put a fire up under me like rockets when they lift off
The map, these rappers that recite raps
We don't believe 'em like that
Deadbeat dad sayin' that he'll be right back
But city that's rough and looked at as them black sheeps
With them rap sheets that's long as track meets
So let's take a stroll, come follow me down these back streets
Where blacks and the trap meet
Killers and dealers that had dreams to be athletes
But them dreams got put in the back seat
And makin' fast funds the shotgun
Got some homies that's still in the hood, life finna twirl
They ask me "what is it like to see the rest of the world?"
Away from the block, away from the gutter
All they know is the blocks and watchin' for cops undercover
So what you have here, some niggas that's never had a fear they couldn't face
Tougher than '89 Laimbeer in the paint
Posted, Chuck D coachin', never laid up
City soil that made us
7 mile with the players, Puritan and PA-ers
[?] where the bullets strayin'
Fenkell where the bodies layin'
6th mile where them hollows sprayin'
Woodward where they ain't playin'
Schoolcraft you find that mayhem where hollows holler in the AM
Gratiot where grandma's stayin'
Neighborhood that's decayin'
Niggas pockets is light so that light bill they're never payin'
So fam don't let your lips talk, that could be your pitfall
And get you sprayed on like murals on side of brick walls
Dudes watchin' waitin' for you to get sloppy
Like a hitman lurkin' in the shadows with his shotty
Out here screamin' "Let's go", yeah my nigga X know
City where the TECs blow but we ain't talkin' techno

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Sino]
I'm stumblin' in my Detroit fitted, bitch
Anybody want some beef then we with it, bitch
Shit, see in the Mitten all my niggas 'bout that action
Might be 30 niggas with me, every nigga with me packin'
No fly zone, shit, just for pussies on that fuck shit
Dirty glove, boy this ain't the city to be fucked with
Shout out my uncle Trick, you get to trippin', he gon' dump quick
My city verses everybody (you gotta kill everybody!)
Boy, RIP to Blade, I hope he hear this
I swear if Ron was free, he'd be the first nigga to kill this
Street nigga, give me a ki and I'ma deal it
Better give a nigga his cash or you can feel it
What up Em, signed the city to Shady and fuck it
They say the world is a bitch, I'ma keep on fuckin' it
My city on my back and I'ma keep on runnin' it
Still got that chopper on the back seat, ain't shit sweet, boy

[Verse 6: Marv Won]
40287, I'm out that black bottom
If they don't fuck with the boy, I bet the crack got 'em
It's enough two faces here to attack Gotham
And ain't nobody a ho until the MACs spot 'em
Dot 'em, play possum, no brave option
All of mine yay choppin' and K shoppin'
The nerve this nigga here can play the part of a goon
Transplant your killers if it ain't no heart in the room
Wait 'til he sugar sharp and then throw salt in the wound
These red beams'll turn your white party maroon
I got a pair of gators that I hardly wear
Nigga I will kill you over these Cartiers
I got a couple bands with the dice on the floor
When I was 9, boy I could tell you the price of a bow
Listen, full length minks just to show we stuntin'
Brother you know it's nothin'
Nigga I'm Komen youngin', tell 'em!

[Hook]

[Verse 7: Payroll]
I'm from the west side blocks where we roll in spots
And have blow blowout sales to blow out a watch
Young niggas gettin' popped cause of the clique they claim
And in most homicides, it's a bitch to blame
My future plan's to stay froze 'til my wrist complains
If rap fails, I'm whippin' coke 'til the brick complains
In the new 6 switchin' lanes, probably with big kis
Ain't talkin' coffee when I say the trunk is where the big be
You see that D right above where my lid be
Can't trust a soul, well that's how these streets did me
I bossed up from setbacks by luck, I rep that
Ain't scared of nigga's shit, I'm from Detroit, I expect that

[Verse 8: Hydro]
Look I'm from Detroit, bitch
Where we crack heads and we break bails
Inspired by the dopeman that pack hammers and make sales
Dreaming of a rollie, a coupe, a crib off of late trails
They quick to take a trip with so much weight that it'd break scales
Young boys wilding, with a chopper they'll make hail
Screaming "fuck the cops" and quick to pop off like some fake nails
Shout out to my strippers with 30 inches and fake tails
And pounds of the cookie like I was running a bake sale
Holla if you need it, I got it, just come and ask the man
Try me and get cheddar on your hand just like a Packer fan
Riding down your mama street with tints on a blacker van
And turn your block into a war zone like we in Pakistan
Nobody I can call on, it's ball or get balled on
Wrists full of that shit you niggas can slip and fall on
Why the fuck you hating us when we can put them all on?
And they can help their little mans and they can hit the mall strong
It's 7 Mile 'till I die, raised by some street niggas
Fuck friends, ain't got none, I'm dolo with this heat, nigga
Boogers in my watch face, my wrists be looking slimey
Once I fuck she's like my seatbelt, I put that bitch behind me, nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 9: Big Gov]
My timing was perfect, designed to be worshiped
Like Jesus as a fetus
Was destined to earn my stripes like Adidas
Needless to say I'm the sniper
Pick us off, niggas soft
While they spitting bars in the middle of a cypher
I'm from the same hood as Big Meech and Big T
So miss me with ho shit or end up on this street
Home of the big three; big cuffs, big guns, big chips
Where broke niggas get hood rich off of quick flips
I'm from the city where the bitches even gangster
Suck a nigga dick, get her robbed, tell 'em thank you
We don't fuck with you outsiders, learn who to talk to
Or get stomped for feeling like the man when you walk through
And I don't even walk around with my chest out
But know it's drama when you see me with my vest out
My next route is finding out where you rest at
Catch you sleep, make the crime scene where you slept at
And the next cat who disrespect my city on some rap shit
I'm on his ass like cellulite on a fat bitch
This shit is drastic and you ain't gotta ask if
A nigga come disrespectful, he leaving out in a casket

[Verse 10: Boldy James]
Detroit VS everybody, that's me against the world
I might not sell a cop, but who need a brick or girl?
A thousand grams on my cock, later alligator
Moist of the aviator, cardi sipping activator
Never been a punk, faker or a lean whipper
Steady packing eighters in a one paper king swish
Concrete, definition of real street nigga
Whole hood know that I'm the only real D nigga
That really mean it when you hear me say I am Detroit
Can hear it in my voice, my fault Em and Royce
For being four days late turning my verse in
But me and Ready Rock was in the spot putting that work in
What was you doing before you ever touched your first ten?
I was in the streets with my peeps getting them chirps in
Text me when the work gone, I text him back the work end
Tryna get my hands on the pack when they first in
On my Captain Planet I possess earth, wind and fire
But you being a liar is the worst sin
Keep throwing rocks at the throne with a glass chin
I'm still that same nigga on the corner with a half grin
I never let these niggas use my ears for no trash cans
Been selling dope for too long, it's time to cash in
King James, before this rap shit I had street fame
And the keys to the city on my key chain

[Hook]

[Verse 11: Kid Vishis]
Whoever said Vishis phony, get to know me
Our hollows'll make a rapper drop the mic, no diss to Joey
Guns of all sizes, I fire and get smokey
Riding with the biggest ratchet on the car dash, I call it Khloe
You think you hard? I think you doughey
His guts'll fall out looking like someone stuck a knife in a stoagie
Homie, you owe me your life
I'm Columbine balling, throwing a stripe
Wiping you out and bounce like a thief in the night
I now control machinery, it's like real steel
Gun ductaped to the tires, that mean I will kill
They say I'm fooling to 'em
They asked me for a hot sixteen
So I lit my notebook on fire and threw it to 'em
Here's a DeJ Loaf punchline
I kill your whole family and leave a red trail, that's your bloodline
Try me, I bust nines
Stick a clock in his mouth and make him chew
Yeah, nigga, it's crunch time

[Verse 12: Big Herk]
We got them choppers, how a nigga with a knife gon' win?
Y'all just shooting the breeze, they done let a cyclone in
This what happen when little mama boys trapped grown men
Lyrically ahead of my time like the iPhone 10
And why Detroit always get a bad name?
My city ready to blow like we here to gas, mane
These niggas thinking they dope, but their shit a tad lame
Man, their pen and pad game more like Trinidad James
Fuck you and whoever you run with
I'm on that BS, I'm still in the middle with dumb shit
I'm a beast, everything you hear me spit real tight
Your flow wack, it's out of Egypt, nigga, it's real light (get it?)
I'mma keep it real, niggas can't fuck with me
It's like I contracted Ebola, they ain't touching me
Detroit VS Everybody, niggas know we started that
Now every city all across the world want a part of this

[Hook]

[Verse 13: Icewear Vezzo]
Street niggas smarter than Kwame, bustin' hardbody
Panorama fold up Porsche, let the car box me
I know niggas ain't sold shit, they did armed robberies
Rugrats buying out bottles and playing with old Tommy's
East side, come to the zone, that's where the lions play
Young niggas stepping on blow, that's where the tigers stay
In my hood the first of the month, that shit a holiday
These cemeteries meet their capacity every fathers day
Hit a lick, keep all the work, get the stolie back
Tell a jeweler don't say shit, just get the Rollie checked
If them niggas bump one lip then get your homies wacked
I swear that you knew my boss, bitch, I'm Tony Jack
Real shooters run in the trap with them choppers out
Heard them niggas bumping their gums, see what they talkin' 'bout
In a spot with so much syrup, this bitch a waffle house
Hit the pharma with so many scripts, could buy the doctors out

[Verse 14: Detroit Che]
I'm Detroit Che
I'm as sick as some syphilis, sicker than Detroit hate
If you come knocking then it's trick or treat
I call up Tricky, load that shit then let that trigger squeeze
That shit ain't sweet, I'm from the murder mitten
Never thought my friend would've been a murder victim
I'm in that van, I want revenge, I'm on some Kendrick shit
I'm pissed off like a mistle, his dick's soft, he's ticked off, he can't get shit hard
If you diss my city I will set it off with a motherfucking semi that's bigger than Big Sean
Our city is Marshall Mathers on Adderall
You better pray we not mad at all when them gats involved
With swisher cap, we're flicking your fucking city off
I'll bust your fucking noggin, you disrespecting my city, dawg
I'm queen Che been on the throne for a minute
Before the cypher I've been slicing dice, these hoes will admit it
Bitch, I'm Slim Shady, we louder than M80's
No, I'm just playing, hope he hears it, I'm just saying
I'm a renegade, pussy sweeter than lemonade
You'll never penetrate
DeJ, tell these bitches to try me, I'mma demonstrate
Vez, tell them that I got options, I'm a real estate
On them properties like monopoly
Detroit VS Everybody, I make a verse versus everybody
Fuck your city, no fly zone, nigga, it's Detroit Che versus everybody
Detroit vs everybody, it's Detroit vs everybody
Fuck your city, no fly zone, nigga, it's my city versus everybody

[Verse 15: Calicoe]
(I just have to talk shit for a minute, man
I have to get in my zone, man, huh
It's the going, going, back, back to Cali, Cali, to Cali Cali)
Cali Cali, that's where I get them cheaper at
Your number like my number, I need a number I can reach you at
Want my price, then you get a price, I want at least a stack
You pay my flight, then you pay your flight, I'll meet you back
Middle man in my own plug, I can teach you that
Detroit vs everybody, who could compete with that?
You thinking everybody zips slow cause they got a plug?
My nigga, everybody zips slow cause I'm showing love
So whenever you make a flip again just know I'm showing love
If cash die, I'm on the strip again, just know I'm throwing dubs
Big roochies on the Michelins, rolling A1 dubs
Mind on my money, fuck a nigga tryna hold a grudge
Them crabs in the bucket used to slow me up
And now I'm sitting at the top and it's lonely as fuck
Got 20 thousand for my red bottoms
Cause I was standing in this blood after I headshot 'em, nigga

[Verse 16: Diezel]
It's me, bitch
Mafia captain, OG, bitch
20 years, been Detroit vs whoever, nigga
The right hand to the hand that be gettin' niggas
Goon squad mafia, mobbin'
For this dirty mothafucka, where it's my home
And I love this mothafucka
So I stood on the front line, ready for one time
Duck some shots, and buck bled for my line
All for the love of the palm of the dirty glove
Every hood, every block, nigga one love
7 mile is the hood where I came up
Pray the game keep it and get your weight up
Bitch you better say us when you're talkin' 'bout next
Detroit niggas stood up when put to the test
Like what? Nigga, who? What the fuck
Anybody wanna do? We ain't hear shit
One army, one city, one sound
It's Detroit, gon' shut shit down
It's time to return the king his crown
Fuck who got next, nigga we got nowPart 1: Sunday's Best
[Verse 1]
Ayo, rise in the AM – early morning laying, I just wanna stay in
I just wanna lay in – pops like “get your ass up, stop the faking”
“We already late, and ..”
Sunday morning waking, faking like my stomach’s aching
Moms pull out clothes just for Sunday’s best occasion
Bowtie, no lie, church shoes was aching
80-degree weather in a blazer, body blazing
Already can’t wait until this day end
Just a little nigga that would rather be home video-gaming
Now we on our way in - deacon speaking
Preacher preaching to that congregation, mason (mason...mason)
Minds wandering off, not hearing that man of the cloth
Talk about that man on the cross
Now we back to praying
Old ladies with church fans screaming out ''amen''
Looking at that painting on the stained glass
Watching while that collection plate pass
Tithes, offering, to me it’s all the same cash
Fast forward, got older – a younging that’s gone bad
Let me rephrase that, a younging that went down that wrong path
No matter how religious moms or pops was
Still had encounters with the cops (I was young)
Product of that environment I was in
Once I left that front door, I could have been out of here
Bullets flying is the norm, so most kids walk without a fear
Friends dying is the norm, so they walk without a tear
Rather tat it on their face - to who’s? Wait
While the old head is yellin’ “it’s never too late”

[Bridge]
Too late, too late, too late, too late
Too late, too late, too late, too late
Too late, too late, too late, too late
Too late, too late, too late, too late
Too late, too late, too late, too late
Too late, too late, too late, too late

Part 2: Monday's Worst
[Hook]
It’s never too late to get your values straight
Can you believe me, baby?
It’s never too late to get your values straight (no, no)
Do you believe me?

[Verse 2]
Heater on the dresser, stomach growling
I’m thinkin’ “how can I make some dollars within the hours?”
It’s funny how them hunger pain to your rib can
Turn a decent kid to doing a bid
Over stick-ups, nothing come, so screw the consequences
I’ll throw this black hoodie on, walk into this kitchen
Grab my keys and my phone, call my mans to see if he’s with it
But he didn’t pick up, I guess I’m on a solo mission
Times hard, my God, I can’t even lie
A 9-5 is not what I’m tryna do to survive
I’m thinking while on the hunt
Somebody ‘bout to stumble out of this club drunk
Without having that chain tucked
‘Bout to get that fucking chain took, nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yeah - in the club, chain hanging, swinging, wow
Baby moms is sending texts and sending threats like
“Where those payments?”
On some deadbeat dad shit, I hate you in the worst way
Spend money on rozay, instead of your son’s birthday
Mad quick, I told her “hold up, hold up, be there tomorrow”
Then went back up to the bar to get another glass and a bottle
Okay, can’t let her ruin my high tonight, not alright
Plus I pulled this chick
With every sip she’s looking more and more like the model type
Ayo, lets leave, I take her, reach for my keys
I’m stumbling out the door looking for my car on the street
‘Til I see this black-hood wearning, staring nigga tryna stick up
Shots go off, I fell victim, damn...

It's too late

[Hook][Produced by: Black Milk]

[Intro (Repeated)]
Cause he down with

[Verse 1: Black Milk]
It's that overdose daily
No if, and, buts or maybes
Have you addicted like that shit my auntie smoked in the 80s
Auntie Tricia, what up, I see you still live and maintain raw
So I rep it, spit raw, spit hard as the veins in your arms
Reminisce back on the innocence
Back when the money was limited
Before we had stacks, before we had racks
Before we had raps on the internet
We was in class driving the teacher crazy, hoping the bell rung soon
Before labels we banged on tables
Inside that school lunchroom, doom
Only one that graduated but still hung outside school
Was cool with the dropouts
Didn't want to work around the clock from 9-5
Just to clock in and clock out
Some niggas had packed things and sold it to crack fiends
Some niggas had dope wrote in their notepad but couldn't turn it to rap dreams
But I did what I had to
Had to stash that cash up under that mattress
Hoping that a few years later, sooner than later I could put moms in that mansion
Back up against that wall
Back in the trap where nigga feel trapped in
Either you a hustler, either you a dopeman
Or you got the muscle in the hood like Conan
Wrack em, sack em (whoop whoop)
Play cool when the cops roll past em
If you heard that (whoop) you knew they were hopping that fence so the cops wouldn't grab em
Some of the visions we saw, some of the sounds we heard
Left that scar on the brain
And the bars, and the verse, and the words and the Hearse

[Hook: Mel]
It's just a different way of living
Ohh I knew the hand that I was given
Hustle, up early in the morning
Grind on the way, on the way
Talking bout death around the corner
Hoping that we don't meet soon
Hell Below

[Verse 2: Black Milk]
So when you waiting on those days of fortune
Unfortunately yo, that wait is torture
Like holding breath under water, your the
Star a million miles away, just a minor way
Almost got got on a holiday, but he got away
What you think they troubled for?
Didn't grow up comfortable
Or comfy as the lives of Cosby's and Clair Huxtables
Need a couple grand in they hand put the handgun
To the next man, grandma live longer than grandson

[Hook][hook]
The good stuff
Girl let me step into your world we can do it
Good stuff
Yeah you know I'm always with it
I be over in a minute
You with it
Good stuff
You not trying to be alone
Nah I hit you on the phone
We can talk about
Good stuff
Tell me if you need it now
Yeah you know I come around
Put it down
Good stuff
Let me, let me
Girl let me step into your world we can do
Good stuff
Yeah

[verse]
A lot of time gone by since the time of every guy [?] wanted her since junior high
But ever since eleventh grade her body got older
Plus she knew it so she threw it to this nigga that was older
Already pursuing, screwing, niggas in they twenties
By the time we graduated she had already had plenty up in her
But i said i still would hit it if i ever had the chance
Ran into her years later clubbing with her friends over tequila
Surprised she remembered who i was
Rarely looked my way back in the day
As a scrub
But see that was the past
She's feeling my presence
Cuz she probably seeing cash
But i knew it
Brewing the small talk
For a minute
While i'm thinking to my self, like
Damn she looks different, different, but
Thinking if i wanna still live out that fantasy i had when i was younger
Putting her legs places, hands grabbing the rail
Talking bought past dudes and how the put her through hell
Flicked her cigarette ash down on the ground
Said that we should even though she knew i wouldn't be around later, later

[hook]

[bridge]
Good stuff
Good stuff
Good stuff
(nigga wake up) good stuff
Nigga wake up
(nigga wake up) good stuff
Nigga wake up

[verse]
Morning after
I didn't mean to spend the night
Let me get up, got a bad feeling, wait
Rooms still spinning
Barely remember last night fully
Wake up old girl laying next to me, remember her texting me right back
Like what up, where you at, where you at
Fast forward, meet me at the moe
Oh snap, got it bent flat, throw it back, throw it back
More drink, more drug, throw it back
Break for a minute, breathe, then we go back
Legs roll back, pssh, do that, pssh do that

Let me wake her up
Give a little shove like wake up
Ai, baby girl wake up
Fuck, of shit, fuck
She ain't waking up
Body leaning
Oh shit she ain't breathing
Nah, ain't real is it
Empty bottle, no pills in it
On the nightstand (damn)
Baby girl wake up wake up
Fuck
Where my phone at{Verse 1} (Dilla)
Yo EL and 'Tin kill'n em, Three kill'n 'em
You thought we broke up but we was just reassemblin'
Ladies and gentlemen you barewitnessin
The villa on some classic shit like vans emblems
It's the guerrilla pimps, we bustin denim in the club
That you can't wear ya denim in
Freakin a rhyme til every line ends with a then and than
You dont wanna rump and stomp in Timberlands
Shout to my nigga Killagan
And all of my peeps that rep more D than 12 Eminems
Who let the dogs out and let Dilla in?
Fuck wit this is ya loss Gilligan
Sounds similar I'm not feelin 'em
Get the balls like Venus in Wimbelon
While I'm in them fly whips five Will and them
On some Kim and them All About the Benjamins
Still here

{Chorus}
Still here, never left, just switched the style up
Came through, made moves to get the crowd up
Its hard time "V" time nigga ya times up
Get rowed up for the Reunion

{Verse 2} (T3)
L kill'n em, Dilla kill'n 'em
Maybe we could hook up again back wit 'Tin and them
Together again like armed forces on some Fantastic Four or Four Horsemen
Can't do it without ya crew boy
Guess who boy, comin' through with two boy
Nobody but us that rap in a clutch
Passed and switched it up like kids in double dutch
Some couldn't feel our style or feel flow
Never talked our slang, never walked our road
All they know is these niggas is tainted
Don't know about those rovers that candy painted
We've been miss quoted, miss construed, miss understood, and over used
So we take this time to set the record straight
Critics skipped and did it anyway
Now you hear our raps wit Dilla and you all on our team
Till you heard 'Tin was gone was apart of the scheme
See! We still got love where was you at at?
Just cuz a nigga go solo think we turn our backs
Maybe we will reunite on some shit like that
But I gotta set it straight 'fore you twists the facts nigga

{Chorus}

{Verse 3} (eLZhi)
Yo T kill'n em, Three kill'n 'em
You thought we broke up and ya you rite we really did
I wrote a verse that I recited it was hot
But I had to rewrite cause I thought we was united and we not
But though all the love that I got for you
Partna I picked apart ya words and I'm shocked in the interviews
I been accused of not carin'
When the city threw your furniture out
Its not fair when I'm learnin about how stress you fell in a article
Forget a rhyme I'm just as real when I talk to you
And you know that we share Kodak moments
I wish we could go back
But don't act like you wasn't bugin out like a phone tap
Chasin' cars in the street
I saw you throw up hard in the sink
Then after hit the bar for a drink, who asked you to slow down?
Even though niggas told me you was gon' clown
But I tried, and you know I cried when I saw you wild'n at the State Theater
In the door by the side
Throw you in the trunk and found a preacher for you
Cause I thought you had unlawful demons on you
Sinkin fast in the deepest soil
Ya parents finally got you some help
You came out seemin normal and
I heard you on medication
Had a illness you couldn't heal with herbs and meditation
And believe me; Me and T, Three kept it low
Don't take this as a dis this is just to let you know that I love you
But watch the company you keep
Sware niggas don't care, but they love you in the streets
Get ya mind right nigga...[Verse 1: Elzhi]
I end careers, years, pierce ears fierce with spears
They say I'm gifted, get lifted like the beers in Cheers
Catch a thunder bolt, pockets stay lump from hundred notes
Stunning quotes make you run your coat while the sun's afloat
Prehaps, my skill is real as G Rap's
It feel as ill as concealing drills in the knee caps
Your funny style get three snaps in the circle when off
The purple and greens, I'm higher than the jeans on Urkell, then I murk you
Bust tecs, the lead sparking now who be my next head target
I lift up, roll out, like the red carpet
Say my name three times in the mirror and if I hear you
I'll appear clearer, extend both arms and pull you nearer
Pound for pound, I'm pretty live on the mic
And keep it flooded like Mike, on Motown 25
Put your soul on ice and sold it for a whole known price
I'm nice, keep a knot swole on dice
Grin is sarcastic, the way my pen'll spark acid on the bar
Whether in the crib or the car, blast it
Son is a, prob rob funds from your publisher
While his dogs put his guns to you like the Punisher
Or the Terminator, flow is harder
Than a German major midterm paper, the kid burns the saber
Striking cats, how you want it, gats, spike or bats
I know you liking that, I stay sharper than Viking hats
Exhale, blowed mist, served you with a cold dish
Niggas vomiting, bowels moving, they can't hold piss
El and Royce, double team, hotter than a cup of steam
Club your spleen and bury you, just as deep as a submarine
Flawless, should be that very reason you applaud us
You saw us laying down a law just as raw as a crawfish
You met your death and although, I took away your breath
And I ran, I still left with a Grand like Theft Auto

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9"]
You little niggas can't touch me, baby
Okay, maybe Jay Z or maybe not
Pardon if I sound lazy, I've been puffing crazy
Writing Puff's shit, so mothafucka fuck you, pay me
Or lay down in your feces, my guns talk, I'm speechless
My Pen's that Teller, I bends that fella, now peep this
I eat you and then wash you down with who you eat with
Me and Elzhi, yeah, we split
He's sick, I'm sick, I'm sick of how sick
He is, he's sick of how sick me, is me, baby me
Sickest in the D, since the Shady LP
I can fuck, that's what ladies tell me
'83 I was fucking, I was six, head in my momma's daycare
Yeah, that was nothing, I'm the shit
Back into my rhyme again, niggas call me arrogant
That's because I'm confident, I found it when I found a pen
Three deals later, three meals later, tryna win
About to be signed again, that's right I'm bout to clown again
Knock-knock, who is that? It's the cat that'll snap
Throw cheese in the trap, on you homie, you a rat
Ha-ha-ha, I'm back, matter of fact I've never left
Those who say they ain't expect it, can't accept it
Haters left this, boy no choice but to blow
Fuck another ho from on another pole, fuck a show
Fuck a flow, I'm about getting money fast
While you rapping or perhaps you hustling sucka slow
Ice glow, sticky green, bush on sicky team
Capone, put powerful "White Boy Ricky" cream
Get him straight if he leans, fifty fiends in a line
Nickel Nine, been around, niggas you would kneel around
From Milan to Iran, I'm a don
Now when I'm around niggas calming down eating like it's Ramadan[Hook: Black Milk and Sample]
Try to find what you can get
But all they dish you up is shit
(Stop talking shit)
Look around, we're folding Earth
Try to find out what it's worth
What it’s worth, worth
What it’s, what it’s worth

[Verse 1: Black Milk]
Honestly, gotta ask myself
Time and time what I’m working for
Is it worth it, though?
Look at fam realize what I’m working towards
Keep they pockets filled with stacks
Gotta keep food up in they fridge
Keep my moms up out of that trap
Keep my bro up out of that pen
Never had a land in hand, always had to play my part
Play it smart
Artist about his craft
But sometimes survival is bigger than art
Yo, this life is bigger than me, feel weighed down by a hundred boulders
Got family on my hands, crown on my head, city on top of my shoulders
Fuck what these niggas say, fuck what these niggas think
It ain’t worth the time
When you got fans with they hands in the air
Making sure you don't gotta work a regular job on a regular
You got niggas tryna live they dream
But you got niggas that live the reality, not tryna live above they means
This what, this kinda life I dream
Two shots to the head, two shots till we dead
Just what this kind of life might bring
That’s what this kinda night might mean
You clock in or be glocked in, OGs here, no stopping
As long as breath’s in my lungs waving white flags ain’t never the option

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Black Milk]
I see I’m talking and debating about my rating
If I only had one fan rating me high I could never feel underrated
So I hear too many questions about
Why you not working, when the latest out
Never was one to go to another one just to feel validated ’bout
Shit I’m doing, all around the world
Tryina give ‘em what they asking for
Yeah, I’m good from the borough all the way to Euro
Hood pass with a passport
Hit a toenail, go back to the Mo
But it sound like we’re raised around criminals just to hear shots outside of the door
Give a fuck less about shots and subliminals
So so so so
Let it breathe, let it doze
Me and my niggas had dreams, cashing checks with seven Os
PA, Westside, hop in the truck like let’s ride
Mom’s looking at the time, hoping that her oldest son make it back inside
And I did that, live by a code, live for tomorrow
Walk down streets where empty hollows stray, sidewalks where broken bottles lay
I did that, went from boom-bap in the day, go rap round the neck
Double track and the deck, lay it back on cassette
Yeah, yeah, they lived that

[Hook][Verse 1: Black Milk]
(Uh, Yeah, Yeah)
Funky line ripper
Henny lime sipper
Many rhyme flipper
9 to 5 quitter
You the type, out of sight, out of mind nigga
I'm the type, dynamite, gotta dine with em
Or a 9 with him
The raps stay nasty
Your white girl tripper
White line sniffer
Every line in I give them suicide hitters
Flow turn real spitters into wrist slitters
From a city of real killers
That don't see a lot of sunshine like Bill Withers
Old people live but kids gets killed quicker
The chances of seeing age 30 got real slimmer
The block still filled with the drug dealers
Pimps hoes and wig splitters
A lot of real sinners
Oh god he go hard like O Dog
On film a real menace

[Verse 2:  Fat Ray]
(Drugs, Yeah, Yeah)
Ray got the girl scouts smoking
Right back rolling with the rap Joe Rogan
It's fat and black nigga
The Cadillac emblem
The criss cross daddy mack nickles, scrap niggas
Clap pistols and act ignant
It's your business to get riches like Guilt Simpson
The coalition
We in the kitchen with a quart of chicken
Water whippin
Your ho track sends snippets
Facts shipped in
Niggas shoot like Blake Griffin
Or 8 grippers pull strings like Jim Hendrix
Niggas went from poe pimpin'
To Olympians
And weak Timberland
To real Gremlins
And the beat goes
Like the wolf in sheep's clothes
I beat little bos
Who's east the streets hold
The beast mode
Chiefs bellisimo me bro[GZA]
Speaking of this artform, the slang is dangerous
MC's are like sperm cells, a gang of us
Fighting to reach the egg, biting and lose a leg
Odds are like 1 to 10 million, the kin thread
One from a thousand speaks in his own voice
The other 999, imitates without choice
They never even knowing it, until the going gets rough
You see the Amplified Sample I'm throwing with
I grab the microphone, the unthinkable happens
See the rockets red glare like the guns when clapping
They still cage matching MC's thats scrapping
Not the UFC, but my opponent is tapping
So don't let a little bit of fear turn to hatred
I was sent as a savior to revive what was sacred
Also stop this uncalled for behavior
And sipping back cats, they lactase in flavor

[Hook: GZA]
Got word from the wise to let it drop
Set this on fire, take aim and let it pop
Because regardless to whom or what, even the door shut
I'm giving 'em straight raw, you bringing them all cut
Like Bolivian rock, your watered down hip hop
Raps so out of shape and far from tip top
Pearls next to pebbles, spoons against shovels
Dictators next to rebels, and Gods against devils

[GZA]
No time for backwards thinking, let's think ahead
If you want to sleep when you awake then make your bed
Alotta MC's came to see me on referals
Not even knowing that they would undergo great perils
These cutting edge methods from the most specialized
Faster than the last men, and before the dust'll fly
The lord of the art, strikes a chord in your heart
Your ear love to hear the God, ripping tracks apart
Me to hip hop, is like Einstein to science
A match made in heaven, most likely an alliance
Complex individual that you dream of being
Intellectual challenging, the all eye seeing
Got an appetite for heat, so then come and bite the beat
And digest the rest and don't stress the part you couldn't eat

[Hook][Verse 1: Torae]
With all due respect, I barely respect niggas
Nike sweat suit, I'm ready to check niggas
Give 'em scarf work, I'm all on your neck nigga
Sway the revolution by waving the Tech nigga
Wake Up Show
Still sleep, time to wake up though
You might see me with the mac, but it ain't makeup yo
I make up flows, to cake up and make up mo'
Stay low so the jake don't know
Bae bro, this heat take
Time to make sure that the street straight
Lock it down on the release date
Bury the beat breaks
Heavy on the beat until the beat breaks
Bag a bad bitch then beat brakes
Double entendres
Barrel brothers is double the monsters
While Random Axe is at it bonkers
We body your roster
In broad daylight
Tell 'em "rockabye baby" until they all get the concept

[Verse 2: Guilty Simpson]
Yeah
Chip off the old block, a great shot
From right here, I can pick off your whole block
Pick off my old knot
My pocket is a dead president's cemetery
I get your buried and I still pistol carry
It goes without saying, I'm spraying at niggas who change clothes
Used to keep work with one my main hoes
Then I had to dump her and grind it all summer
Your frontrunners turn gum-bumpers
My gun slump ya and leave you in a slum dumpster
My understanding is zero, try to play hero
I'll point a desert eagle at your ego
That's just me though
Squeeze the hammer when I see a vandal
And beat enamel off his teeth with the heater handle
Fuck around and violate the squad, I'ma buck 'em down
Who got the muscle now?

[Hook: Skyzoo]
All in together now
It's whatever now
Jordan 3s and 'lo knit sweaters now
Know the league is ours like forever now
50-40 and 90 if you let us now (x2)

[Verse 3: Skyzoo]
Ugh
Monclair skully is fitting me like a crown
I'm all year money so this isn't coming down
The talk here is funny, I'm listening for them now
We all here hungry but shit if they want a round
Now, do believe I'm true indeed the 2 to 3
Shuttlesworth and I'm Buttersworth on a shooting spree
Sharp-shooter, park shooters, move the Cs
Get it? Shuttlesworth? Part seas?
JESUS
Are we to end at the same dot?
The throne for the crate, I'll slip you a straight swap
Man down, kudos and you know
You stand up with me
You standing next to the Pharrell like a Hugo
And for this new wave that's all swinging for mine
I was probably hitting your moms and penning your rhymes
I can't lie if seen me in and out of your place
I should've stuck to my gut and let it rock in her face
Now pay homage

[Verse 4: Sean Price]
All praises due
Respect that, say that Sean shady too
P, shake salter the shakiggity salt shaker
Not condusive to big words like Walt Frazier
I'm more major but I'm minor to Ebro
Touring all the time, what the fuck does he know?
10% bloodsucker of the poor
I'll untuck the gun, buck the sucker on the floor
P
I don't like boy rappers
All marked for death like the white boy Hatcher
I'm no racist so white boy rappers is good money
Look I just despise toy rappers
Sean is the shit
The shit Sean spit is legit
Legitimate bars, pa you a ignorant bitch
Hip hop hooray
Be happy a nigga here for hip hop today
P[Verse 1]
From the beginning we started out where the [?]
It's the of the struggling artists displaying [?] war
Trying to juggle with stardom
And create something that comes straight from the heart
Is the hardest task hoping it always lasts
And remain with all the cash
But fast liquor surrounded by fast woman
Make you make fast decisions
Bad decision
Trying to capture the feeling you felt
When it was just you feeling yourself
No interviews or album reviews good or bad
Just lyrics with pen and pad and beat that played in the back
Round back when you said you had that
Sound and your instrumentals and
Still won't let you live out the shadow of your hero
But fuck it know what you're here for
To hear them with that shit that the one and only
The only one that matters potential
All higher they say I'm all wired all fire and why is
That every ball been sharper than [?] fire
Trying to keep us in the dark
But our sparks brighter than [?] lighters

[Hook]
Gone so long
Still Holding On

[Verse 2]
Magazines take cover shots
Used to hear shots
Mom said take cover
Played on tapes [?] breaks
Wasn't the best way to record loops
Wished the excitement was still the same though
Thoughts of changing the game go away slow
When you realize how the game go
Open eyes no surprise had to change for the better
Took time to cook rhymes and aim for the letters
TOP when they OD on kicks and snares
Stuck with me the fans that fuck with me
Threw that middle finger up like fuck the rest
No sleep I'm up when I'm up against the world
But only up against myself
In a lane of my own no cars in it
Write bars and beats with no flaws in it
And put my ten thousand hours in it for over ten years
Went a hundred miles per minute
Through the finish line
But I'm not finished or ending while time is ticking

[Outro]
Gone so long
I'm still[Hook: Black Milk]
We got another one popping
Turn it up a notch and keep rocking
Turn it up a notch and keep knocking
The haters wanna look, then keep watching
(Ha Ha) Laugh at them, let them look
Cause they know they can't stop us
(Know they, know they) Know they can't top us
Keep dropping, niggas keep watching

[Guilty Simpson]
This one is sinful sentiments
I keep a pump like adrenaline
The opposite of innocent, gun play is imminent
The penmanship red, your dead, scribbled in blood
Wannabe thugs fled and gave the ground a hug
I got an airhead rat I like to keep doped up
Told her that she was dreaming, her man got his throat cut
Jedi mind trick a bitch, push a sell and get a chick to split the L
If the pigs flick the whip, give me bail
"What up, though?" to Brooklyn, the dogs are loose
Who calling troops? The shotguns tossing goose
And broke the treaty, I'll smoke you easy
Murder City where the rich are broke and peazy

[Trick Trick]
What the hell? I reckon they want a twelve
The second I heard this record, I figured I might as well
Aggravate and piss off those that can't stand me
Like man and the man is trying to raise a family
Ban me, I said it and I don't give a fuck, call me the outlaw
Thinking I need this business? I can do without ya'll
As long as Agent K is making fully-automatics, I'mma get it
And I ain't bullshitting you can forget it
Pussy-ass niggas popping shit on they webpages
The game has become outrageous
The stage is set for real niggas to come out with them gauges
And the gangsters out of them cages

[Hook]

[Sean Price]
Off the wall, no curl kit, no electric socks
Your world flip, pearl grip on the sket that pop
Murder, death, kill, Villain from the 'Ville
Pill-poppin', still real cocaine-cooking niggas drill poppin'
Sean Price the name, Random Axe is the group, duke
I spray shots in vain cops, fuck it you loot, duke
Hippity-hop niggas wanna rap in the booth cute
Meanwhile I got crack stacked up in the deuce shoe
Fuck fame, homie, I rap for the change only
Counter-punch suckers for lunch, I'm James Toney
You got the star look, but your ring and your chain's phony
Back of 'The Source' jewels, slap, we force cool (Ooh!)

[Rock]
We all one in the same
It's like I am Ruck, I am Black Milk, B
I'm Trick Trick, I am Simpson, but I'm not guilty
Rock filthy, the block's feel me
I own them, fuck a Donald Trump, I'm 'Donald Dump' I got realty
See me in HD, high-def, definitely high
Stunting caught 'em all, berry niggas cry
Oh, I know Inspectah Deck 'em in the eye
You not doing the electric, I ain't letting niggas slide
Act up, it's ramifications of blamming a gauge in
Your face, It's beef, not the shit on a sandwich your making
Amateurs faking but don't respect or knock your ganstafications
Me? I'mma a monster, my mere presence will panic a nation
Niggas 'bout as loyal as Popeye bitch Olive Oyl
No beef raps, but I got drama for you
Think about it, you know who I got with me
Brooklyn, Detroit, same shit, they both 'Rock City'[Black Milk]
Ayo
Long awaited, Debated
But fuck it here we are brah
Here to save the game just like a memory card
Memory loss to cali dro
To Amsterdam, out on the patio
Rockin like a Beatle I should record up in Abbey Road
Bet he flow, there he go talkin that
Hoodrich, money talk
Hoodrich, Black male
With music thats always in the hood like crack sales
Or out in the burbs like E pills
He feels niggas can't fuck with him
Shows, plenty fans round the globe screamin out y'all niggas can't fuck with him
(yep yep)
Hit 'em with that new shit
Hittin off a new chick
That want me in her mouth like a toothpick
Who flips better heat? See this shit's timeless
While ya'll niggas got bad timing like teen pregnancies
Better be, Better see
We comin with better heat

[Danny Brown]
Sittin on some Kobe's
Smoking on a stogie
Bangin Noreaga
When I'm done I light the bogie (what, what)
40 on the floor mat a leave ya holey moley
Banana in her tailpipe, I'll make her Axel Foley
Eatin on pierogies
Goose mixed with Sobe
Smokin on a OZ
Pimpin like a O.G
If you never knew me, then you probably never know me
Blade on me homey mask on like Shinobi
Ball so hard, got a MVP trophy
Smoke so much kush I forget the hoes that blow me
Thick white bitch slurp a nigga like Kirby
Hoes on a nigga and they all look thirsty
Say they 19 and they all look 30
Everyday clean y'all always dirty
Chronic coming in same bag as a turkey
Dark color purple and its tasting like Hershey[Verse 1:]

In my uniform Starter jacket cape as old as my little brother
I came through that gate like no similar others
My brother 22 if that line went over you
You open up the trunk and you'll find where I through the stu'
I'm probably known to you
As 90% better
And neck and neck with the 10 that you covet but it's whatever
Whatever shoulda been said will be said when they start sayin'
Why they said it's over wet with the best of the bar cadence
But hey
We good though
As long as my hood know
And my hood in the loop like the part where the hooks go
The heart of a crook though
I see the facade
I do it for the Yout Dem like Onika Miraj
All I need is a charge
And a lane to be y'alls
But until it
I play the bullets that'll race through ya car
Until it
I sit and pull it if you breakin' they heart
And then you playin' dodge tryin to get away in ya Dodge
Double meaning
Want it and wanna be it
For the logo
And know yo that nothin' will between it
On the low though
I hand em' the real and call it even
For the dough yo
I plan to Darrelle
I'm on my Revis
Need us
We right there
Pronto wit it
I mean you ride for that ride
Play the Bronco wit it
Tell em spell it backwards and give us Harpo digits
And the broads from Tiatro to bring us Mambo chicken
D.C. waddup
Howard homecomings
Dope jumpin'
Flow feel like if ya throat runnin'
No dumbing
Did for mine from side to side
I'm to Brooklyn what Penny was to Memphis in '95
A walking Lyricists Lounge
All of this is the now
Meaning by tomorrow I bury this in the ground
Given the grammar in here I see we're unfamiliar
Shit is a family affair and we deeper than The Sylvers
I never had the back of my neck under nobody arm
Nobody helped I ain't here from nobody palm
Word to the critics and the women who tagged em'
My life is XL ratings and XL Magnums
In the spirits two Margarita shots
Pardon me but I been hot
Arguably I'm at the top
Part of me is for the block
Part of me is for the guap
All of me is what you cop
Carter me like it's The Roc
14 wit a flow
I was underneath the block
Thought Jadakiss was Jesus I just wanted to be The Lox
Fast forward to the now
Can't a soul see the jot
Or the scribe or the brushes or whatever I should drop
Mawfuckas can't touch em' you oven mitten the burners
While they callin' me the top three of the Brooklyn worders
Like
Big, Jay &; S-K
I give away the left lane
Anyone who feels differently you tell em' press play
"Great Debater" took 30 days to come up with
Sean Price said "It sound like you mad and Sky, I love it"
Fuck it
Penny Series
The first time did it
Otis Redding was resurrected when I work my pennin'
I'm just honestly approaching it
If I be over throwing it
The ladders by the tree for the Frisbee's that you can go and get
So you can go and get em' and...

Damn what happened to the beat?
(Yo that's the end of the beat)
Word?
Well fuck it
Penny Series
Black Hero Music
Week 3
Yea
And by the way that Black Milk beat is one of my favorite beats ever
So that's why it got tagged
Black waddup
Call me S-K-Y-Z-O-O
Yea[Hook: Fat Ray]
Get the hardware, take it to the enemy
The hard-heads all here, man the artillery
Niggas go to war for their liberty
Black ops, arms and abilities

[Verse 1: Guilty Simpson]
I'll turn your favorite artist to a mural
Put papes on it, with his birthday
A dash, and today's date on it
I didn't know I was confusing you, shit
We gotta eat, even murder these a musical this, this
This isn't for the weak hearted
You're who the streets target
With the tattle team, so we hurt one
Put them in the hospital, get them all together
And then the whole waiting room is getting magazines
Splatter dreams
Attitude is like gimme money and a bag of green
I'm blowing smoke signals at an Indian broad
I told her I'm unemployed please give me a job
This grade A potent and grade A smoke
I'm loving it
R.A. wrote the grade A dope for hustling
And where we from and where P from
It's guaranteed cats in the hood is gon' fuck with it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Sean Price]
Question, why you hem your jeans
Y'all niggas looking like Ben Vereen
Don't get rocked, pa, Benjamin Grimm
With a nine double m on the scene
Fuck around and make your Timberlands swim
Drown nigga
Fucking clown nigga
313 and Buck is the town, nigga
I'm Sean, King of the Apes
You prawn, king of the shrimps
Funny style, limp wristed son of a bitch
This nigga put fingers on this trigger
One or two pulls, this nigga is disfigured
I'm a good father but I really be illing
Colt .45 on my side, no Billy Dee Williams
Around blocks niggas like where the work at, behind you
Right on the corner in the jaw of a minor
Your whole crew is pussy and very vagina
Promise to bust your snotbox whenever I find you, P

[Hook][Hook: Tone Trezure] x2
Stop! You can't find your way in the dark
You gotta see it
You're wasting time sitting and talking
Get up out your bubble and go
You get the feeling

[Black Milk]
On that black card (repeated)

[Verse 1: Black Milk]
Solid from the top
Left the world solid from the start
Was silent as a whisper in the dark
Bad intentions from the start
Had to make a choice prior
Either white picket fence or that fence with barbed wire
So reach for the cash money long, yeah we on the cusp
Reach for the stars man my arm's not long enough
Dreams of big whips sitting next to big cribs
Woke up next-door bout down house from where I live
You know those slums where them slugs hum passed your wig
Young kids at the store buying mom's pack of cigs
Life's short and everybody want they gold medal
Before you lay six-feet underneath rose pedals and...

[Hook]

[Outro: Sample]
"Where's my money motherfucker? Where's my money motherfucker? I want my money, I want my money!
I don't care if I have to revive your black ass, I want my money!"It's hard in these streets
From Mecca to Jerusalem
All day every day

[Verse 1: Vast Aire]
Toe flex we bout to blow like octane
You know Cannibal Ox got mad slang
Who cares what you're named
They say a man who repeats himself is insane
I mix my saliva with propane
Flame on I spit that hot fire with Dylan
And stay inside the line with crayons
My whole aura is neon, ultra violet
Come out your mouth
I might get ultra violent
Now it's so quiet
You was popping that junk
Now it's so silent
Here's another token
We are the chosen
Wolves in the coven
Blade of the Ronin

[Verse 2: el da sensi]
We deliver the livest your novice we polish
Acknowledge ?? mad men, shottas and god fathers
I rock the flow brick city bandit, im doctor no
Star studded glow cardio bars we give the go
Administer quotes
Diminish folks in minutes call it dinner time
Eat your food, rude or push harder to the finish line
?? shine, musically we harness
Due process and Marcus flawless bombers
All time writers and fly garments
Marvellous talking prior markings, fire for warning
Inspired informant desired the entire performance
Niggas is boring we got the remedy virus in storage
Hennesy pouring, AOF, cannibal ox recording ah

[Verse 3: Vordal Mega]
Formalities and certain chances and variant circumstances
In surge of advancing
To miss the pivotal point
Integral click and digitally went spittin'
Never that vacant transmission
Getting off ways like jet motto
Livin in ways you set morals the righteous path
Write on pads and lace audio, keeping kids
Being more intuitive monstrous
Learning origami, with folding paper into Ferraris
We move conscience, speed gazing, navigation
Looking like lasers, through night mazes

[Verse 4: Tame One]
Did you hear of it?
Im harsh as the march chapter in the spearmint
With enough psychoactive synthetic substances to begin with
Generate combine within, to transcending
The second Nordic artefact independent descendent
Psychedelic therapy magic, meditation
The ritual is verical spiritual dedication
Well established hip hop savage with the cabbage
On average with multiple sounds of blackness
This is black magic, true art from new jeruz new arc
With two part documentaries fireworks shoot sparks
Go beyond we draw fire like kobes arm
In hip hop i go grimlock on stages that they throw me on

[Verse 5: U-God]
First class nigga
She on me like axe on my chest
Fresh like crest, straight headshots only lames aim for the best
Im taking 99.9 percent of the bet
Y'all can have all the rest, stress
Intravenously i feed these niggas the truth serum
Spit fire like he got a dragon in the booth with him
Hold your head and stand still
Balance the equilibrium
Process the beat, create heat
Faster then the pentium processor
Through the hood known as the pie stretcher
Measure the texture of the fish scale upon the dresser
Own a sea biscuit win by a nose on the track
Live at the aqueduct
NY yank on the hat
Whos up to bat
Sending a SOS to the slums of shao-lin
And to the late night husters on the north side of the island
Surveillance at the corner my eye
Bitch get off the snapchat and drive
Being followed because i sold a thousand instgrams, glide[Intro - Elzhi - talking]
Yeah, yeah
This your boy Elzhi
Finally here now
It's been a minute though
You know what I'm sayin?
I came up from nothin
Doin my thing, so I got the right to brag swag
Makin money off music I create

(*scratching*)
"Create"

[Verse 1 - Elzhi]
Yo, the day that hell snowed is when El fold, poetry well told
It's entertainin, keep niggas trainin like the railroad
Stingman, what I bring in is dope as the kingpen
Slingin, OG's threw me beneath the wingspan
Expert, through the less dirt, but still my tec squirt
Bucked, then it gets tucked in, just like a dress shirt
Been a beast in a winter fleece, time for your dinner feast
With a pen unleashed, if there's a priest, within a piece
Quick to lead, stick chicks of the thicker breed
Get fricasseed with trigger speed, you puffin nigga weed
I buy hundred dollar bags, Cadillacs and polished Jags
Yeah, I show you how to brag, while the hours drag
Spit quotes that slit throats, bet it could split boats
Get votes off shit wrote, I'm the legit G.O.A.T
And no statistic, to bitch niggas I'm chauvinistic
I tote a biscuit, carry arms like shoulder discus ('scus)

[Hook] (*scratching*)
"You heard what I said"
"Makin money for the music that a nigga create"
"Makin money for the music that a nigga create"
"Nigga you heard what I said"
"Makin money for the music that a nigga create"
"Makin money, money"
"For the, for the, music that a nigga create"

[Verse 2 - Elzhi]
Remain a fresh goon 'til my flesh prune
You'll need a vest soon, to catch a chest wound
Have you rest, above the crest moon
On your block, get your door knocked
Then by my warlocks, who wore Glocks
And left you with stains too deep for Clorox
Run rap beneath sun cap, levels is untapped
Done laps around a spun mat, hoes get they buns slapped
Y'all panic for all static, that's what I call frantic
Lookin shook as a small planet, becomin volcanic
Off top, y'all soft pop, weak as a cough drop
I love cop, to stop in the mall, so I can club shop
Veteran, you better involve us all in the letterin
If I don't get your girl wetter than, I must have met her twin
Create rhymes that are straight bombs, and call 'em Napalm
I date dimes and maybe an eight, if she got great palms
'Nough said, get at a rough dread, so I could puff red
I cuff bread, I'm paid and got maids, that could fluff beds
I even snuff heads

[Hook] (*scratching*)
"Hey yo"
"Hey yo"
"Yo, yo"
"Nigga you heard what I said"
"Makin money for the music that a nigga create" ...
"Nigga you heard what I said"
"Makin money for the music that a nigga create"
"Makin money for the music that a nigga create"

(*scratched until the end*)
"Create" - 7X[Hook - Black Milk]
Wake up, the new shake up
It's to make up, the crew break up
The wait is over
Thug out, wait up
Who said get over?
No doubt, wake up

[Verse 1 - Black Milk]
True minds are mine, 2 minds combined
When/where in time from the red sin skyline
It's match-up, it's madness with magic
2 of the most finest putting classics
On the canvas. But, it's no use
No paints, no inks, the vocals turn into
Visions on display once he speaks
Take a seat, the story begins here
Family defined, always surrounded by mad peers
The hell ?, hoping that in 95
Will blow trees with OGs they idolize
Moms trying to keep her son close by
Pops worked all day, couldn't keep a close eye
So I had something that wasn't in each home
Raised white, but still I knew the street code
Ran with some honor roll kids ? footstep
Keep a couple guns in their locker
Instead of books. Hoop dreams, jump shots
With hella hooks. All got shot down
By bullets and lives took
Cries, mom's tears fell on the casket
Summer's off to college
But never made it to campus
He's from a block where they consider
A ? alarm. Friends gone, get drawn
And tatted on their arm
Don't be alarmed, we all singing
The same song. A million souls
We all singing the same song

[Hook - Black Milk]
Wake up, the new shake up
Is to make up, crews break up
The wait is over, no doubt, wait up
Who's taking over? No doubt, wait upChorus (Dwele):
All that I want is to show you love
All I got to do is find the time
So when can I see you? (I see you love)
I know what you want
I know what you want babe

Verse 1 (T3):
Yeah yeah hit my ring ring call me
I know I'm always busy s-s-sorry and
We don't even see each other much hardly
It never stopped me from girl thinkin bout your body
Swear to God, she's so s-s-s-sexy
Thinkin to myself the lord must've blessed me many times
I wrote many verses girl, many lines about you & me
Us together intertwined
On some s-s-serious shit
Girl you got a nigga st-stuttering
Got me on some long term thinkin other than
On some diamond ring shit
Girl smotherin, we be t-t-talkin on the late nights
Takin trips to see each other on the long flights
Spending tour money on you girl I don't mind
But it's been a minute girl, you been on my mind
C-c-call me

Chorus

Verse 2 (Elzhi):
We brought each other pain, fought without ballin' a fist
Yellin, niggas could hear us through the walls & the bricks
Sayin what we don't mean
Stabbin each other in the heart through the back
And actin like the cuts just don't sting me neither
See the sun but the clouds make it smoky
You was my down chick when others just went down on me
Must've saw something in me to wanna birth my first
You changed my mind about raising a child on a earth that's cursed
Wonder where we went wrong when the thing's so right
When our future looked brighter than casino lights lit on the strip
In the bed you shocked me, bit on your lip
Sex was tighter than a leather outfit on a gimp
Was our feelins supposed to disappear the minute we kept, lost
Started out on a good foot then we eventually stepped off
Or is it just troubles that couples go through?
Mad on the phone can't hang up
But I'm hung up on you
Give me a call

Chorus

Are we in love?
Is it possible to have love within this relationship?
Cause now that I got the time
You should call me tonight
And I'll be alright oohh

Chorus[Verse 1: Sean Price]
Chewbacca
Duece-duece Papa now rocking your shoes proper
True shotta, nigga you noose nada
My three versus your four, who crew's hotter, Random
Everbody on my team is winners
Everybody on your team beginners
Why you do that, rapper
Fucking new-jack rappers
Flinch when I walk by cause I do smack rappers
Sean the Barbarian
Deadly dose of the dope shit, black tar heroin
The best out, bar-for-bar Pa
His god given talent scream Al hum du'Allah
You got no skills, you got no talent
You're shit no frills and your bitch toss salad
Niggas rap albums sound like love letters
Pen in my hand like, damn fam, I can do much better

[Refrain]

[Verse 2: Guilty Simpson]
I write classics, you can't hack it
You know what it is
In the room with the floor covered in plastic
Passive, never got a street-cat pay so I'm active
Stay back
I keep that blade
Hi, hater
I'll carve a smile right next to your frown like laugh now, cry later
Potato on the barrel
French-fry ten guys
For major violations, call it annihilation
Your tough talk, I don't get it
You wouldn't fight a ticket
So why recite a lyric
Especially when lyrics get a rifle at your fitted
I'm sure to buck so tell Pac what up though
My foes better be real
You wanna be tough, alright you'll forever be still
Still I get nicer, yet I'll ice you
And rhyme with the force of a Jedi cyhper

[Refrain]

[Verse 3: Roc Marciano]
Marcberg, baby fire it off
Split your cabbage
Bitch ass rappers spit garbage
Live lavish, Mac-10's under big jackets
Hit me a pass, flip that mattress
Remember the patterns
Five stay dipping in traffic
Parle stiff in the cabin
With axes, dismember a faggot
Limbs is scattered and littered with maggots
Splashed with gas, we lit up matches
That's for acting real tepid and passive
Ya'll asking to give out passes
I pull up, get out Astons
But never without ratchets
Busters feel our wrath and
Butlers will fill our glasses
Brothers ain't up in our bracket
Slugs from the gattling, spin out rapping
Flip the casket, lyrics is crafted
Hit them with the plastic and then I'll pass it[Intro]
Yeah, hope you can see my vision

[Verse 1: Black Milk]
Came from the gritty no lavish life
Came from a city with no flashing lights
And where your casket might drops outta sight
And where niggas keep them guns singing out Gladys Knight

Without the sacrifice I wouldn't be here though
Book shows, tours going throughout the year so
Lemme introduce you to the new improved
So ahead of the class might as well skip school

Be a minstrel
Got them amazed on instrumental
Instant classic for you pass my intro
Tell her get in so we can get ghost
She can tell I got finesse from the way the pen strokes ya
My life, story that I been through
Chapter after chapter, pages you can flip through

Music by the wayside
It's the game I'm hip to
2005, when he hit 22
First album's alive and ever since then
I been one step ahead of the game like stairs
My influence hopefully inspires some peeps
Who are the next up
Getting everything I dreamed for

[Hook: Black Milk]
Yeah, yeah, still on a million-dollar grind
Hustle til the sun don't shine
Still hustling when the sunrise
On a rise, yeah he doing fine
On a high, I can't even lie
Yeah, he trying to kill him every time
Gotta get it every time

[Chorus: Mr Porter]
To grow into a better life
I'm standing here fist up ready to fight
Experience is the blueprint to life
Look at me, I'm doing fine

[Verse 2: Black Milk]
So I got my new back dropper
Feeling like you not guy
Cash in my pocket so my pants look lopside
See the car drive by fast
Not caring where the cops are
Why these diamonds glaring like a cop car
Fuck being a pop star
I'm trying to be a rocker
Listen to this kid flow
Damn this nigga got bars
Almost where I wanna be
But I know I'm not far
On this elevator trying to make it to the top floor

Nigga now you showing out
What you call swag
Then what you call me
Cause I'm so better than that shit
I laugh, it's funny how I mastered
What he call simple, these other call it advanced
Shout out to JKwan, Knotz, and my mans Madlib
Alchemist, 9th, Crisis and Khalil
Nigga Pete Rock and my Miss Careme Whigs
Money sees bitch
Money schemes big
Wish my nigga Proof was living to see this
Wish that nigga Dilla could hear this new shit

Shout out all my dream
Shout out all my goals
Wish for a lot of things
Careful what I ask for
Only God knows where this rollercoaster ride goes
But reaching those dreams the only thing I know

[Hook: Black Milk]
Yeah, yeah, still on a million-dollar grind
Hustle til the sun don't shine
Still hustling when the sunrise
On a rise, yeah he doing fine
On a high, I can't even lie
Yeah, he trying to kill him every time
Gotta get it every time

[Chorus: Mr Porter]
To grow into a better life
I'm standing here fist up ready to fight
Experience is the blueprint to life
Look at me, I'm doing fine

[Outro: Black Milk]
Yeah
What up to all my peeps, came through to hold me down
But look
We been here for a minute, We just getting started
Yeah, I'm out[Verse 1: Black Milk]
King without a care, frownin' while the crown lay on they head
Crew recruitin' Huey Newton, chair sittin' here no despair
You was on a star chase, I was in a dark place
Lookin' for that glair
Lookin' for that light ahead
Days got dimmer starin' down that dark tunnel
Hopin' that you see a glimmer when them walls start crumblin'
Calls stop comin' in
People start mumblin'
Stomach start rumblin'
Need to hear applause and the fans call once again
Cab driver make a right, right up at the light
Destination, life
But stay here for a moment
I shouldn't be that long just keep the meter goin'
Keep the meter rollin' while I go in for a few
Left a song for the little one, tell him Dad cares
Wish I could've stayed longer, gotta pay this cab fare
But um, you hopin' better days'll come
Face to face with reality, no VH1
I sit back some, Watchin' my niggas that spark live
That's waitin' for sunraise to penetrate dark clouds

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
So I'm standin between vanity and foolish pride
On 7 Mile and Telegraph where the two collide
If I'm a man amongst kings and gods, who am I
For leavin' so many crucified or coup d'etatd
I'm from the D where everything is very do or die
My will to survive is what's separating you and I
My memoirs is revolutionary suicide
Now, who the realist nigga alive? Well you decide
This rusty .45 is never under-utilized
What goes down like a logo on a Puma Clyde, homicide
Probably on these loudmouth bumbaclots
Thinking it's cool to walk around not supervised
But fuck supervision, cuz you and you can get it
Lately I've been having premonitions of superstition
But if I stepped into the confessional, who would listen?
I need to change my ways, show me the new religion[Hook]
I can paint the dawn with a sunrise
I wish I could for you
I can touch a cold day with springtime
I wish I could for you

[Verse 1]
Cold day in the summer right when you think that it's over
That's when niggas put you under yea that inner city weather
When crooks is always ready, you should walk around with toolies
Tucked inside they pellie pellies had a cousin made me look out to make sure no one is lookin
With the stash in the back, stashed the bag in the bushes didn't want me to know either
Fuck rules took jewels ran by her procedure so (spring)
He slanging out his granny house just to stay fresh, didn't wanna wear hand me downs
The cost of that drama some money flow lil gold plus a couple baby mamas

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Cold day like snow day
Brands new whips and driving slowly
Pulled over by them boys in the neighborhood they don't know me
Whips too nice it might be stolen, he gotta be rolling you gotta be kidding
Wanna search the ride nigga you gotta be sniffing
Only thing inside was the CD with the name on it
Let him slide but the next guy might just put the blame on him
Ain't nothing changed on that block we used to run up up
Some heads left and a few more houses boarded up
They needed more than luck but
They still crack a summertime smile in the city more than rough

[Hook][Intro]
Settle down class, take your seats
Pull out the manual and turn to chapter three
We about to learn the lesson on color schemes
You ready? Here we go

[Hook]
Okay, kids, today we learn the color schemes
Like purple hearts, black clouds, yellow submarines
Can't go wrong if you listen to the song when it's on
Listen to the song, sing along to the (Colors)

[Verse 1]
Damn, it's fucked up how they found Tune
He was robbed for his gold chain in front of a brown stone
But what's a fellow to do if he not earning one red cent
Or trying to make the green like mixing yellow with blue
Oh no, it's true another black on black cause it's lynch fly
That's what I heard, word get around like the pink eye
Watch out when your enemies sneak by
Wish I could pour white out on these lines before the ink dry

[Hook]
Okay, kids, since now we learning color schemes
From Red Cross, blue shields, yellow submarines
Can't go wrong if you listen to the song when it's on
Listen to the song, sing along to the (Colors)

[Verse 2]
Now there's some that's dead from fighting over breadcrumbs
Feet and head numb, it's a murder, we call it red rum
Got them boys in blue with black jacks locking the new youth
They sell purples through Blackberries with the Blue tooth
Saw this gold digger red bone I knew poising in Black Tail
Another black girl lost inside the world of Black Male
And white collar crime done on the sneak tip
Different from blue collar workers catching the pink slip

[Bridge]
Yo, red, yellow, orange, green, brown, white, black
Pink, purple, grey, blue, now let us bring it right back
Blue, grey, purple, pink, black, white, brown
Green, orange, yellow, red, now let us break it back down to the (Colors)

[Verse 3]
I think it's quite foul while I sip the Grey Goose and orange juice
And twist a white widow in a White Owl
How first you painting the town red beneath the night skies
Now you going to trail telling little white lies
It gives a mother the blues to see drama
Printed in black and white on papers that cover the news
And read some dudes in a white tee was laying in old piss
A victim of a drive-by, they even killed his goldfish

[Hook]
Okay, kids, we done learning color schemes
Using words like white horse, yellow submarine
Can't go wrong if you listen to the song when it's on
Listen to the song, sing along to the[Danny Brown]
Used to be starvin' trying to pack a bag of ramen open
Now I gotcha bitch chokin' on this dick long strokin'
Everyday; bong smokin'
Champagne; glass toastin'
Suckin' on this sex pistol 'bout to blow her brains open

Used to fuck with rat bitches
Now I fuck with bad bitches
Fuckin' since middle school
And dog you never had bitches
Dog I came from rag to riches
Now I got your bitch permission
Squirtin' on her lips and when you home you gon' kiss her

Take a nigga head off
Like a hot mascot
Tell me why your breath smell
Like a burnin' bag of fag cock
Blowin' on some apricot
Crib like Camelot
Thinking of the days when I was countin' up my sack of rock

Leave ya with a Scarface
Cause you niggas rap a lot
Nigga you a sharpey
Homie I'm a long grenade
Found them yellow diamonds have a nigga leakin' lemonade
Nigga you bitch made
'Bout to need first aid

Dog I'm on the grind
Like an old stripper
In a room full of virgin nerds and fat niggas
Now we pack swishers
Drink straight liquor
Make ya bitch go down low and lick your sister

Ghetto ass nigga that dressed on suburban
Rap niggas gettin jerked
Ain't no Jergens
Fuck so bad in they ass fit Excursions
Detroit niggas got it wrapped like turbans[Canibus]
You want a facelift? This what it take 'Bis
A beat that'll make a nigga think an earthquake hit
The blue collar rapper, enigmatic, democratic
Rap-saavy fanatic that can smash any matchup
High with a roach, bring wealth and goggles to my show
My flow glow brighter than any diamond that you know
I walk among you, draw energy from you
The art of Sun-Tzu, he used to bust too
I'm like a Shaolin monk on crunk
Holdin himself up with his thumb on the stump
Get a Hummer for the summer to stunt
And just sit in the front, while my lungs become one with the blunt
Futuristic old schooler, look like JFK Jr
When I shoot up, Jacob the jeweler with a new cut
Can-I-bus, I ain't got what I want yet
How would you expect one of the best, what
I can't get no, grab the mic, niggas lets go
Tell me who got the best flow, end up with less dough
Open your vest, let your chest show
I'mma open your chest, let your breath go
With a thirty-eight special
Keep it on the low, don't let the press know
Behind the scenes, they put me on death row and won't let go
Brace yourself while I break the chains
My beats bang so hard, they erase the blame

[Hook] 4x
This is full battle rattle, attack you
Salute while I smash you, Can-I-bus bus to blast you 4X

[Canibus]
The hudred bar monster, spit without hawkin up
Smash your whole roster, fuck what it cost ya
Fuck what it cost me, join the army
Smoke Bob Marley, the sergent major honorably discharge me
From my sentimiliar and my hemping sence
Inspiration, why is it only worth ten percent
Another day in the life of Mr. Can-I-bus
MY life too rought for me not to recognize lust
The soldier's back to blow a fuckin hole through rap
I wish they'd let me out the cage and stop holding me back
You might say the only thing holdin me back is myself
It ain't hard to tell what's holdin me back is my cells
I don't make records for girls, I spit for the pearl
But I'm an artist in an ignimant world, world
World class athlete, trained to attack beats
Mixtape smash the streets, try to patch the leaks
Niggas try to battle me but lose
They got limited views, I remember when I was primitive too
I'd sit and talk with the inqusitive youth
Cause I be spittin the truth
Sometimes I ask 'em, what you listenin to
Lyrical fitness is the proof, let me put you in the booth
Nottz'll play the beat loop
Let me see what you could do
The older advise the younger when they recognize the hunger
I do a couple raps with the mic to get pumped up
Monkey bar sit-ups, blood rush to my head
I write rhymes upside down with an astronaut pen
Spit a hot sixteen and my ten, take it up a notch, then
Lost everything when I'm locked in
You in the kill zone, boxed in
Tried to play jump-rope
With skis on and got dropped when you hopped in
The last mohican, smoke you in the first season
You don't speak it but it's no secret
Peep it, you light weight like rice cakes
Anybody under twenty-one to touch the microphone is mic bait
Hungry niggas start to get type faced, that's when the fight breaks
A sixty second rhyme is a nice pace
Work a nigga out 'til he spit out white paste
Tell him he could hide the proof on his face with night shades
You looking for a battle, you came to the right place
This is Mic Club and over here I'm the mic ace

[Hook] 4X
