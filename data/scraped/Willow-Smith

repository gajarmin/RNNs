[Outro: Jaden Smith] x 2
Baby you can be my catfish
I never see you I just text you on the phone
And you look just like that actress
What's the name?
I'm afraid that if I see I'm freakin' suffocate
Or do a backflip
Yeah, I'm knocking at your door
But I died so they put me in a casket
People say Jay your just over-reacting
But your like the girl that I never had
You're my catfish[Verse 1: SZA]
Breathing's easier under water
I can see sky from here
Please remember, all you've taught her
I can see God from here
If only I could stay, If only I could stay for you
I would, try
If only I could wait,If only I could wait for you
I would, fly

[Verse 2: Willow]
If only I could stay, If only I could pray
If only I could wait, If only you could stay
Up, up in your zone, Yes, you're all alone
Yes I'm all alone
Not negative, Just different
You wanna have lunch, and I wanna have a picnic
You wanna go up, I wanna just fly all night
Cause baby you
Got me tired of this, love thing its tough cause i, want to love you but you, keep being so afraid, afraid
If only I could stay, if only you could stay
Up, up in your zone, Yes you're all alone, Yes i'm all alone
Getting in the car, we cruisin', going down the pch, im going to get a smoothie
Never had a problem, but i know that you gon' do this, cause you the smoothest

[Verse 3: SZA]
Blue is the emotion, that I'm feeling
Apologies an option, let me hear it
What took you so long to finish your storm son?
Not negative, Just different
You wanna go out, I wanna finish living
You wanna get up, When i could just lay all day, with you
When I could just stay all day, with you
Hey baby, you're sack of potatoes, we could grow eyes for later Moments to savor

[Verse 4: Willow]
We made, We made, We made art, art
I can't stop, stop, you've blown away, away, away
I don't play wanna no more, I'm not a kid no more
I've did some things, that you can see, that I've been gone away
That I have room to be whom I want to be, and you don't even talk to me
It's three, It's three, It's me, It's Moi, It's jay, It's all these days
My days are numbered, you can come through[Intro]

[Verse 1]

I just landed in another atmosphere
I'm just floating, in a stain steel sphere
I bet you have questions, like where did I come from
I know,I come from that planet that hit Tiamat
Years ago (4x)
I do my flows and then I get so lost
Light just take my sphere to go (4x)
To the top of the pyramid let's save the world like this
Conversing with light bodies,but really they're all apart of me
Let's get the whip and go,cuz I'm tired of this solar ring

[Hook]

It's really out of my control
How you feel is not my problem
I do not want you to go,but I don't know how to stop you

[Verse 2]

Whatever, whatever I guess whatever
I don't care, get dressed whatever
I don't feel like talking, whatever

[Hook]

Cuz it's really out of my control
How you feel is not my problem
I really don't want you to go,but I do not want to stop you

[Verse 3]

Cuz you gone do what you got to do
And what I do is not your problem
Just let me let me love you
Stop trying to make it complicated

[Hook]

Really out of my control
What I do is not your problem
I really want to go
But please, please don't stop meHow you feelin'?
How you feelin'?

I've been goin' all week doin' my class now
I'm just gettin' so weak
I'm just climbin' on trees and skippin' my class now
Don't place your blame on me

One and a two and a three, three, four
People knockin' at, knockin' at my door now
I don't want it to get bad

But let me tell you right now

I've been goin' all week doin' my class, tell you right now
Tell you right now

How you feelin'?
How you feelin'?

After I give you that amethyst crystal under your pillow now
How you feelin'?
I saw you walkin' down the hall
I knew it was you but my mouth didn't call
I thought that I wasn't the one that you wanted
Until I went onto your inspir and done it
I just done it

Let me tell you, tell you right now
I'll tell you right now

I've been climbin' in trees and jumpin' in creeks, tell you right now
Well tell you right now[Intro: Jaden] x2
Don't tell me you cried cause I know that you didn't
Don't tell me you love me, I know I'm just trippin'
Cause you tore down my ego, and I listened
Why did I... listen?

[Verse 1: Jaden]
Man I met a girl at Coachella
I like her but you know I couldn't tell her
Cause she had her own fella and I met a blow dealer
He told me that he was a wholesaler and I'm fly as propellers
Man it's rainin' umbrellas
Tati went to go and find Stella
Teo went to get Bella, now we waitin' in the cellar
I hope your man doesn't get jealous
Cause I grabbed your hand in a blur
I saw that he's insecure, he's the one with the MSFTS shirt
With the eyes
And your eyes are lookin' at me with such a deep surprise
Baby girl I can see under all them lies
I can see under all them lies
(She's gonna try to kiss you, Jaden)
Well I'll suffocate if she tries
And I'll hold her tight if she cries
Man I met a girl at Coachella
I like her but you know I couldn't tell her
Cause she had her own fella but I met a blow dealer
He told me that he was a wholesaler and I'm fly as propellers
Man it's rainin' umbrellas
Tati went to go and find Stella
Teo went to get Bella, now we waitin' in the cellar

[Refrain: Jaden x5]
I hope your man doesn't get jealous

[Bridge: Willow]
If my red eyes don't see you anymore
And I can't hear you through the white noise
Just send your heartbeat, I’ll go
To the blue ocean floor
Where they find us no more
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean...

[Interlude: Jaden/Willow]
Don't tell the police, don't tell the police
I fell in the crease of reality and blood on my fleece
My head is in peace, says look at the height that we reached
We're like some whales but we should tan on a beach
Well that sounds awesome to me
Magnetics, the magnetics
(I hate myself for hurting you)
(But I love you, and you know that)
(I don't need to explain myself)
The secret Halloween
(They know this)
I'll dream of you
(Jaden, Jaden, Jaden, so many times)
You'll dream of me too
(Jaden, Jaden, Jaden, and dream of him)
Your hands there on my face
(Jaden, Jaden, Jaden)
There will be no better place

[Verse 2: Jaden]
I know it's not my place to say I love you, but who's it up to?
Alice went down the hole an hour ago and she's in trouble
I should be down on the double, hurry up homies let's huddle
How do you manage being so humble and try not to fumble
And stumble and stumble and stumble
Ricki-ticki and tumble
Like we was in college, I'm sorry, I'ma be with them bumble of bees
It's cold, so baby we should probably cuddle
Put your arms in a bundle, my lips on your neck but it's subtle
Your father won't notice, he's way too busy yellin' at coaches
That college football got him wrapped up, bet it all on the Trojans
I wrote you some notes, they're atrocious
Hope that you don't expose us
Man your love is my narcotic and I double my dosage
I needed a mother figure and girl I guess you're the closest
Girl your body's my ocean, head lay on your chest when I wrote this
And I told you they'd kill us and girl the way that you choked
Was just so emotional that I wish that my mouth never opened
And girl I hope you know that no society or a cult
Can take me away from you, you're the orange juice to my pulp
And girl I'ma say to you, I just wanna grope and elope
But I stay away from you, cause everybody knows I'm a ghost
But I can still dream
I can still dream, I can still...
I can still dream, I can...
I can still dream, I can still dream
As long as I can dream... As long as I dream[Verse 1]
You wished upon a star
Saw the mother snap back and now you're where you started
My heart aches when I see your face
That's the story of this life but my soul saw it twice
Never had a problem but my soul seems to fight through the artifice of life

[Hook](x2)
But it's the flower
It's the flower
It's the flower
It's the flower
It's the flower
We were walking on clouds but greys came down and they wiped us all out

[Verse 2]
I wanna be an atlantean
Let's get the 10, let's get the 10 x 4
And we'll knock down the door, knock down the door
We'll see what they've been hiding
Let me tell you bout the story of Poseidon
He was a young boy who was enlightened, kinda like Jaden
Kinda like the way we, look in the sky and we see the chem trails
And we nearly all cried, and then they just die we merely just tried to help them
The government is tryna tryna sell them not help them
But, the indigos are here we remembered
Remembered how we can all shift the weather
Because, love is the air we breathe, the people we see
The realization that were all in unity
So you and me, and I and I
We're the flower

[Bridge]
We're the flower
We're the flower
We're the flower
It's  the flower
We were walking on clouds but the greys came down and they wiped us all out

[Hook][Verse 1]
So, um
Take the money, take the fame
All I want is truth
You talk their language
Play their games
Act as they want to
Look at you
Look at you
Who are you?
Who are you?

[Verse 2]
You walk the streets aimlessly
The density is rain
The thoughts you think just cause
You pain
And don't make you more pretty
What to do? woe is you
What to do? who are you?

[Verse 3]
You criticize behind those eyes
No hatred you're just jealous
Your subconscious is not conscious
To poison your ingestin'
Woe is you
Who are you?
It's your choice
Just make the move

[Hook]
Burning bridges
Burning bridges
Posies all fall down
Now consciousness is all there is and nothingness as well
What are we?
What to see?
My third eye is opening
I'm burning bridges
Burning bridges
Posies all fall down
Are consciousness is
All that is
But nothingness is well

[Verse 4]
What are we?
And who are you?
Did we just go
Down the drain?
And I just go with my flow
Cause rollin' circles
Rollin' circles
Rollin' circles
The pavement seems too cold
And now my feet turn purple
(Hey, Willow? What?)

[Verse 5]
Take the money, take the fame
All I want is truth
You talk their language
Play their games
Did you forget about
Who you were?
In the stars
Lets go back home
This Earth is hard
This Earth is all up in the stars
The Ursa's hungry he's
Just lookin' for a brotha
To get started

[Outro]
Burning bridges
Burning bridges
We just fallin' down
Our consciousness is nothingness
And nothingness is well
Who are you?
Who am I?
Who am I?
Where is me?
Where is I?
There's no "I"
It's just all[Verse 1: dylAn]
She text me and told me to hurry
I checked my watch it was 11:30
We in the temple sipping on a Shirley, ay
I like her maybe cause her hair was curly, hey
Or maybe it's cause of the freckles
Her cheeks, and her nose, and her dimples
Fell in love and it's so unofficial
I'm busting off, I'm not shooting a pistol
I like to kick it with them duh-uh-uh
We can go to Erewhon, ay
Fuck around and walk up to the Lé Pain
Ay
Cuff her right next to my arm
Walking to the pond
Later coming over, you can always cry up on my shoulder
Yeah, I know I'm getting older

[Outro]
It's been a minute since you called me back
(Been a minute since you called me back)
It's been a minute since you called me back
(It's been a minute since you called me back)
I threw my poems in the garbage they’re trash
I don't know, but I'll be kicking ass
I don't know why all the weed is ash[Verse 1]
Can you feel the breeze?
Because you’re talking loud, I’m talking low for me
Can you touch my face?
And we gon leave the memories outside in place
I woke up one day
Thinkin bout this earth was just a book and gameplay
I guess I took my chance
I guess I took my chance
(It’s all about her)

[Chrous]
I saw the ocean when I saw you
In my sky, that’s where I climb so high to see you
(It’s all about her)
Can you see the words rolling off my tongue?
You’ve got the touch baby cause you’re the one
I can taste the smoke rollin off your lips
I inhale, see the stars and then I smell your kiss
Show me, show me your galaxy
(It’s all about her)

[Verse 2]
You dreamt me up, you put me here
Behind your eyes, inside your mind
I hear your thoughts, you took me there
I tend to stare in your eyes
They’re black as night, when they roll on by
Our bodies shine while our souls ignite
Follow me and my broken lead and we’ll paint the sky

[Chorus]
I saw the ocean when I saw you
In my sky, that’s where I climb so high to see you
(It’s all about her)
Can you see the words rolling off my tongue?
You’ve got the touch baby cause you’re the one
I can taste the smoke rollin off your lips
I inhale, see the stars and then I smell your kiss
Show me, show me your galaxy
(It’s all about her)

[Verse 3 (Jaden Smith)]
I hate the fact you smoke cigarettes
But girl let’s just stick to kissing
And work out our differences
‘Cause girl I’ve been listening to your problems
And lately I do not got none
And girl I’ll stop when the cops come if they ever do
Let’s get back to the residue
Let’s get back to the cuddling
Let’s get back to the huddle
And let’s get back to that puddle
When Jaden was rappin subtle
We went to blast in a shuttle
Off out into space and then bury lies with a shovel
Like am I really that lost? That off in my head
I used to kickflip in my Kostons now rap awesome instead
Throw a ketchup bottle at you
That’s some freaking flying sauces
And go to Mars and show you flying saucers
Man we gotta off of this
We don’t have no parents, all the MSFTS are foster kids
And we don’t have no friends
Cause all you fakies and narcissists
A group of individuals, we kinda like sausages
Homie I’m off of this, what I will do is offer this
Intellect, my extension to enter that
Buy a Ralph Lauren vintage deck without a sending check
In a sec I’m bout to intersect in what you sayin
So I could show the whole world what my penmanship
I ain’t finished yet
Windows tinted, yeah I like to look at all the women
Get hot, when the sun is on I’m summer sun in summer
Autumn, winter, spring
Summer, autumn, winter, spring
Some would like to hear me sing
I’ll buy you diamond rings and saw them in my dreams
And we were all a part of one, forgot our teams
And had a phone that never rings
Love that freakin phone[Verse 1]
So, um
Take the money, take the fame
All I want is truth
You talk their language
Play their games
Act as they want to
Look at you
Look at you
Who are you?
Who are you?

[Verse 2]
You walk the streets aimlessly
The density is rain
The thoughts you think just cause
You pain
And don't make you more pretty
What to do? woe is you

Please remember, all you've taught her

If only I could stay, If only I could stay for you

If only I could stay, If only I could pray
If only I could wait, If only you could stay
Up, up in your zone, Yes, you're all alone

Blue is the emotion, that I'm feeling
Apologies an option, let me hear it
What took you so long to finish your storm son?
Not negative, Just different
You wanna go out, I wanna finish living
You wanna get up, When i could just lay all day, with you
When I could just stay all day, with you
Hey baby, you're sack of potatoes, we could grow eyes for later Moments to savor

[Verse 4: Willow]
We made, We made, We made art, art
I can't stop, stop, you've blown away, away, away
I don't play wanna no more, I'm not a kid no more
I've did some things, that you can see, that I've been gone away
That I have room to be whom I want to be, and you don't even talk to me
It's three, It's three, It's me, It's Moi, It's jay, It's all these days
My days are numbered, you can come through[Verse 1: dylAn]
Have you ever had brunch on a Sunday?
Ahh, baby put your robe on
Come on baby girl, put some clothes on
We about to get our stroll on
Ever had soup with the wonton?
I be down for a falafel, or I'll kick it at Lé Pain and get a waffle, hey
I be in the club without the bottles, hey
I be at the party with the models, hey
Or I'll be cruising in the Tesla, it's full throttle, hey, hey
Now if I said that I was Hancock
Would you go buy me some Stance socks
That'd be top notch, wearing drop crotch
And yeah, I can beatbox
Yeah, the beat knocks, yeah
That's ¿Téo? and the D'artiste
I be chillin' in the fleece
And I kill it everyday when I'm in the streets
Have you seen this new MSFTS piece?
Jeez! When I'm in the streets
I be rocking a pair of Beats and I go freestyle on the beat, hey
I like the sandals on your feet, hey

[Outro: Willow Smith]
La, la, la, wind and rain
Can't stop me
I am on a roll now, and
Anyway, I can get a taste of that higher being
This I will take
Live a little more, then I kush it down
And I push it down
Told me I was friends, then you held me down
But that's okay, we're all the same, all the same
Why you say that?
Because, wind and rain
Wind and rain[Intro: Jaden] x2
Don't tell me you cried cause I know that you didn't
Don't tell me you love me, I know I'm just trippin'
Cause you tore down my ego, and I listened
Why did I... listen?

Man I met a girl at Coachella
I like her but you know I couldn't tell her

He told me that he was a wholesaler and I'm fly as propellers
Man it's rainin' umbrellas

Sorry you had to go (oh) through this (oh)
You had many other chances (oh ohh)
Sorry you came back to Earth (oh) like this (oh)

I went outside on a bright Monday morning
I sat with my dog and read some new books I just bought
I wrote a poem about you
In a couple of moments I know that you know this
But I know you’re just scared of yourself (of yourself, of yourself, Cuz I helped)
Don’t work hard as you
The things that you wish you could do but
I can't, I can't nah I’m just tripping (I’m just slipping)

[SZA]
Young rose, they ask you not to grow here
[Tanning?] where you show, seek what’s on your mind just one thing to know my dear
The dirt is not for you
Can’t absorb the light, stick only to truth
And this is what I know my dear
Show me, you show me, you show me, you show me, you show me
Grow me, you grow me, you grow me, you grow me, you grow me

[Hook 2: SZA]
Dominos, dominos, dominos, dominos
My mind’s like dominos, dominos, dominos, dominos
Falling like dominos, dominos

Young Rose, they said don’t you grow here
Oh no I let myself float here

Well, once upon a time, there was a guy...

[ Willow ]
All she ever did was pick at the scars that he left her
On her heart

And she bleed reliving the sweet words in terrible hurr
She gave him her heart
And so did he
But whe we ripped the cord between his heart and hers
She fell to her knees and disbelief

And she was drowning in the middle of his ocean
She loved him, she was drowning
He drowned her in her sorrows
But he's scared to love another
But he drowned her
And he's staring at her body in the river of eternal love

Blue eyes, red lips, pale skin

[ Mecca ]
He left her (He left her)
Standing in the middle of the street
Yes he left her (Yes he left her)
And she cried out so desperatly
And he dropped her
As she fell into his trap, she can never let go of that
But he caught her ( Yes he caught her)
And as soon as she got up
He pushed her away

And she was drowning in the middle of his ocean ( She was drowning)
She loved him, she was drowning ( Drowning)
He drowned her in her sorrows
But he's scared to love another
But he drowned her
And he's staring at her body in the river of eternal love

[ Willow ]
I dropped a tear in the ocean
And the day that you find it ill stop loving you, loving you

[ Mecca ]
He's eyes stung me with trude
But he's word fed me Lies
And by that time she was...

[ Willow ]
Drowning...
In the middle of his ocean
She loves him
She was drowning...
He drowned her in her sorrows
Cause he's scared to love another
But he drowned her
And he's staring at her body in the river of eternal love

And thats it[Intro]

[Verse 1]

I just landed in another atmosphere
I'm just floating, in a stain steel sphere
I bet you have questions, like where did I come from
I know,I come from that planet that hit Tiamat
Years ago (4x)
I do my flows and then I get so lost
Light just take my sphere to go (4x)
To the top of the pyramid let's save the world like this
Conversing with light bodies,but really they're all apart of me
Let's get the whip and go,cuz I'm tired of this solar ring

[Hook]

It's really out of my control
How you feel is not my problem
I do not want you to go,but I don't know how to stop you

[Verse 2]

Whatever, whatever I guess whatever
I don't care, get dressed whatever
I don't feel like talking, whatever

[Hook]

Cuz it's really out of my control
How you feel is not my problem
I really don't want you to go,but I do not want to stop you

[Verse 3]

Cuz you gone do what you got to do
And what I do is not your problem
Just let me let me love you
Stop trying to make it complicated

[Hook]

Really out of my control
What I do is not your problem
I really want to go
But please, please don't stop me{Intro Talking}
So like
Like you just sent me a text like
Tryna be like cool
Like we're dope now
Like we're dope
Like we're just gonna be friends
That's the text you just sent me
Just now

{Verse 1 - Jaden}
Im kind of lost now
Been intervening, no meaning
I have no cause now
My heart is bleeding
A tiny bit, I need gauze now
Im only pleading that you and me can be awesome
But that's unrealistic
Pain that you inflicted
It's so wicked
Im addicted
Girl the plates have shifted
I ain't tryna get physical
I just, wanna know do you still wear lipstick
Your so encrypted
Your loves my drug, and you got me lifted
Just one night come chill with the MSFTS
Ah, we can just be friends
And we'll hold hands
And dance until the night ends
And I'll run the engine
Don't worry bout vengeance
I'll let you finish all of my sentence-s
You right here, right now
Girl that's a blessing
Just one night we should learn some lessons
Looking so fly, love the that way you dressing
Uh, like this we can get some mo'
Get it poppin like a festival
But the rest should go
I'll spit it you just give me the pace
Can't breathe like Im living in space
Im a kick it with AcE
Sorry ma, I ain't been in the states
Cause my life is a chase
And Im winning the race
See that you wanted a taste
Starts here with my hand on your waist
I don't care what they say
I wasn't even looking at you
But they said you here with that dude
Is that true?
Hop up in the cab too
We be running till I catch you
Don't doubt that
Wanna raid, we can scout that
MSFTS we about that
That's the clique right there
Lil homie you should shout that
Going down, reroute that
We going up right now

{Chorus - Willow}
I, think I, can find you somewhere
(4x)
Dance!

{Beat Drops}

{Verse 2 - Jaden}
Uh, Loo-Loo-Lookin for somethin' precious
All Im seein is toothpicks in dresses
Well I guess it's
Time to leave
Until I get so intrigued
With somethin I can believe
It's like, Jesus
Walked through and putted you in pieces
What I means is
It's time to go get us some beezus
Cause we gon' go to Ibiza and Indonesia
Wherever I can please ya'
Girl Im not gonna tease ya'
We can go up in the trees
Or the palace like Caesar
Just tell me where the keys are
Say cheese
Ah, I hate takin' pictures
Im not broke, so you can't fix us
Im the vicious
Yes, you'll miss us
Girls that kiss us
Rep the Sixers
Uh, MSFTS we soarin
Here in 4 in the morning
Spilt Orange Juice on Ralph Lauren
All them parties are boring
Orange Juice is still pouring
We be wild when we touring
We careless about insurance
And what you did isn't important
We missin up your decor and
We'll end up right on the floor and
We're coolin out with guitarin
We messin up all you chores
Fix it all in the morning
MSFTS is in this roaring
And Willow's kickin the door in
And AcE is killin them chords
Cause

{Chorus - Willow}
I, think I, can find you somewhere
(4x)
Dance! (Echos)

[Verse 1: Willow Smith]
Since I landed here, I gon’ phone up a Obama
Shook the world up, now I caused a little drama
Leader of the new school
And yes I’m gonna light up the block to the stage when I wanna
Brighter than the stars, throw my head up the curve
Don’t get, walk it off, check it I walk with a slur
Levitating in my mom’s all weather fur
I'mma rock the world, til they follow Willow

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Willow Smith]
See I ain’t never been the one to toot my own horn, beep, beep
Now watch me put her on
I set fire everywhere I play, make them all go insane, L.A to UK
Now I'mma burn it up, when I step on the scene
My whole crew is fresh, and they rollin' with me
You can turn me up yep to the extreme
I'mma rock the World til they follow with me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Ayo Willow, didn’t I just see you in China
Y-y-you’re real major even though you a minor
Your daddy keep you in designer
Y-y-you’re girly girly girly, yeah you’re girly kinda
Ok I’m the street fighter, call me Chun-Li
A-a-and it’s goin’ down, l-l-like a bum knee
B-b-built a guest house to put the coupe in
’cause I’m a fireball, Hadouken
Put you under my wing, I’m the top boss
A-a-ain’t from Louisiana but I’m hot sauce
C-c-cuffed the mountain just to go and build a house off
If they comin’ at you tell ‘em raise up
When it’s time to whip your hair, put your braids up
Tell em' escalator, elevator, unimeter, step your weight up
Ain’t nobody greater, Will and Jada is my neighbor, hater

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Watch the fire burn, burn, burn
Watch me heat it up
Watch the fire burn, burn, burn
Watch me heat it up
Watch the fire burn, burn, burn
Watch me heat it up

[Hook][Verse 1]
You wished upon a star
Saw the mother snap back and now you're where you started
My heart aches when I see your face
That's the story of this life but my soul saw it twice
Never had a problem but my soul seems to fight through the artifice of life

[Hook](x2)
But it's the flower
It's the flower
It's the flower
It's the flower
It's the flower
We were walking on clouds but greys came down and they wiped us all out

[Verse 2]
I wanna be an atlantean
Let's get the 10, let's get the 10 x 4
And we'll knock down the door, knock down the door
We'll see what they've been hiding
Let me tell you bout the story of Poseidon
He was a young boy who was enlightened, kinda like Jaden
Kinda like the way we, look in the sky and we see the chem trails
And we nearly all cried, and then they just die we merely just tried to help them
The government is tryna tryna sell them not help them
But, the indigos are here we remembered
Remembered how we can all shift the weather
Because, love is the air we breathe, the people we see
The realization that were all in unity
So you and me, and I and I
We're the flower

[Bridge]
We're the flower
We're the flower
We're the flower
It's  the flower
We were walking on clouds but the greys came down and they wiped us all out

[Hook]How you feelin'?
How you feelin'?

I've been goin' all week doin' my class now
I'm just gettin' so weak
I'm just climbin' on trees and skippin' my class now
Don't place your blame on me

One and a two and a three, three, four
People knockin' at, knockin' at my door now
I don't want it to get bad

But let me tell you right now

I've been goin' all week doin' my class, tell you right now
Tell you right now

How you feelin'?
How you feelin'?

After I give you that amethyst crystal under your pillow now
How you feelin'?
I saw you walkin' down the hall
I knew it was you but my mouth didn't call
I thought that I wasn't the one that you wanted
Until I went onto your inspir and done it
I just done it

Let me tell you, tell you right now
I'll tell you right now

I've been climbin' in trees and jumpin' in creeks, tell you right now
Well tell you right nowInside your mind I converse with your star self
And tell me why I'm here right now
Hidden in a cloud, I'm hydrogen atoms
Split me up and mess up your planet
Mess up your planet
Just like the Greys
Just like the Martians
Just like a [?]
Just like I remember
Star kids and now I'm sitting here
Now I'm passing a lightyear
Inside my sphere, yes in my planet
Inside my heart, I will just plant it
The seed of knowledge
I said I got this

I don't think it's fair that you're on Earth
And I'm up up here
Making stars and galaxies and comets
Making a life on other dimensions

I don't think it's fair that you're on Earth
And I'm up here
Making stars and galaxies and planets
Making a life on other dimensions[Chorus]
I'm me
I'm me
and that's all I can be
I'm me
I'm me
Here's my vulnerability
I'm free
and you can't stop me
I'm free
and that's all I can be

[Verse 1:]
Days pass
I'm trynna find who I really am
(I've been lookin')
People don't like the way I dress, or where I am at
(I've been lookin')
I dye my hair and it's not just vanity
(I've been lookin')
Your validation is just not that important to me

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Night falls and I find it's here I am in peace
(I've been lookin')
Making friends with spirits lost and it sets me free
(I've been lookin')
Express myself
Cause it's my liberty
(I've been lookin')
Your validation is just not that important to me

[Chorus]

[Bridge 2x]
I am me, I am me, I am me
I am free, I am free, I am free
I am me, I am me, I am me
I am free, I am free

Ohhhhhhhhhh

Watch I Am Me video[Verse 1]
I thought you'd be here forever
That's what you told me when I Was Little
But Forever ain't Forever
Until you have felt never
Dang, ok You said that you would be back soon
Just to help my black wounds
You said that is that true
Why don't you go tattoo
My name up on your heart
So we'll never be apart
Even though your clear across
The Universe
Can't hear my verse
Unless I go and scream it
They tell me that I am Dreaming
If I think that we'll repeat it but

[Hook]
The bright sun and the blue water
We fight less and love harder
You telling me that I'm the one
I tell you it's just for fun
The bright sun and the blue water
We fight less and love harder
You telling me that I'm the one
I tell you it's just for fun
We walk the beach at midnight
And watch the stars and the clear skies
We both say I love you
But it's alright
We walk the beach at midnight
And watch the stars and the clear skies
We both say I love you
But it's alright

[Verse 2]
Trying to be a man about it
But there ain't no way around it
You left and we ain't expect
For you to be locked down like I just saw him
I was just chilling with my cousin in the house
Video games till the sun came around
Drinking all the coke all the pop in the house
You was always mad when you came to the house
T top on the I rock
You said I rock passing UROC
Blasting jams on the CD that we downloaded (ha) somehow
I'm Hoping that I'm worth being proud of
All the doves cry without Your love
I Miss you enough to say it's way to much
And I know your touch
So grab on and I'll clutch

[Hook]
The bright sun and the blue water
We fight less and love harder
You telling me that I'm the one
I tell you it's just for fun
The bright sun and the blue water
We fight less and love harder
You telling me that I'm the one
I tell you it's just for fun

[Verse 3]
The closest thing to a padre
Times three thousand Andre
Round and round relay
When I'm thinking on these things in replay
Hair was always in braids
Having all of grandmas traits
Cheek bones and everything
I Can see it clear like hard rain
No that's a bad comparison because the rain has to clear
Showing nothing but love to everyone every single year
Bad things to good people that is what just happened here
But this is just a test to see where do we go from,from here
It's my cue
To think I'm Missing you
Stuff is through
Because I'm Missing you
No matter what you do
We always missing you
And I miss you enough to say It's way too much
And I know you'll touch
So grab on and I'll Clutch

[Outro]
You are my memoriesOne of the gifts of being young is that particular blend of self-confidence and self-consciousness. Jaden and Willow Smith have managed to turn this form of heady teenage introspection into expression instead of ennui. Willow, the 14-year-old musician whose debut single, “Whip My Hair,” went platinum when she was not yet a teenager, explains that the gift of life is “looking at nature and being, like, ‘Wow, I am so lucky to have a body and to breathe and to be able to look at this.’ ” To which her older brother Jaden, a 16-year-old actor and musician, adds: “And the huge, terrible thing the world would be missing by not expressing yourself.” To that end, both Jaden and Willow, the children of Jada Pinkett Smith and Will Smith, released new albums this month, including two tracks by Jaden that make their public debut here.

Jaden’s “Cool Tapes Vol. 2″ is an extension of its prequel mostly in name: “At 12, I was just talking about hanging out with girls because that’s pretty much the only thing I was into,” he says. A few years later, the new pieces are suffused with a different sort of bareness, and a self-guided education in topics such as Archimedean solids and mysticism. On a warm November morning, T sat down with Willow and Jaden on a bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean for their first-ever joint interview to discuss prana energy, the experience of time and the meaning of art.

What have you been reading?

WILLOW: Quantum physics. Osho.

JADEN: “The Ancient Secret of the Flower of Life” and ancient texts; things that can’t be pre-dated.

I’m curious about your experience of time. Do you feel like life is moving really quickly? Is your music one way to sort of turn it over and reflect on it?

WILLOW: I mean, time for me, I can make it go slow or fast, however I please, and that’s how I know it doesn’t exist.

JADEN: It’s proven that how time moves for you depends on where you are in the universe. It’s relative to beings and other places. But on the level of being here on earth, if you are aware in a moment, one second can last a year. And if you are unaware, your whole childhood, your whole life can pass by in six seconds. But it’s also such a thing that you can get lost in.

WILLOW: Because living.

JADEN: Right, because you have to live. There’s a theoretical physicist inside all of our minds, and you can talk and talk, but it’s living.

WILLOW: It’s the action of it.

What are some of the themes that recur in your work?

JADEN: The P.C.H. being one of them; the melancholiness of the ocean; the melancholiness of everything else.

WILLOW: And the feeling of being like, this is a fragment of a holographic reality that a higher consciousness made.

JADEN: [bursts into laughter] As soon as me and Willow started releasing music, that’s one thing that the whole world took away is, okay, they unlocked another step of honesty. If these guys can be honest about everything, then we can be more honest.

How have you gotten better?

WILLOW: Caring less what everybody else thinks, but also caring less and less about what your own mind thinks, because what your own mind thinks, sometimes, is the thing that makes you sad.

JADEN: Exactly. Because your mind has a duality to it. So when one thought goes into your mind, it’s not just one thought, it has to bounce off both hemispheres of the brain. When you’re thinking about something happy, you’re thinking about something sad. When you think about an apple, you also think about the opposite of an apple. It’s a tool for understanding mathematics and things with two separate realities. But for creativity: That comes from a place of oneness. That’s not a duality consciousness. And you can’t listen to your mind in those times — it’ll tell you what you think and also what other people think.

WILLOW: And then you think about what you think, which is very dangerous.

Do you think of your new music as a continuation of your past work?

JADEN: I think Willow’s had a huge evolution.

WILLOW: I mean, “Whip My Hair” was a great thing. When I look back I think, “Wow, I did so much for young black girls and girls around the world. Telling them that they can be themselves and to not be afraid to be themselves.” And I’m doing that now but in a whole different way, coming from source energy and universal truths. People will be, like, “Oh, I’m not going to make a song about exactly how I feel, all the bad ways that I feel, and put it out in the world so everyone can judge me.” But for me, it’s a part of me, it’s my artistic journey.

JADEN: That’s another thing: What’s your job, what’s your career? Nah, I am. I’m going to imprint myself on everything in this world.
How do you write? What’s your process?

JADEN: She gets in the booth and just starts singing.

WILLOW: I mean, the beat is usually what moves me. Or I think of concepts. Then when I hear a beat that is, like, elaborating on that concept, I just go off.

JADEN: She freestyles and finds out what she likes. Same thing with me.

WILLOW: You piece it together. You piece together those little moments of inspiration.

What are you searching for in those pieced-together moments?

JADEN: Honestly, we’re just trying to make music that we think is cool. We don’t think a lot of the music out there is that cool. So we make our own music. We don’t have any song that we like to listen to on the P.C.H. by any other artist, you know?

WILLOW: That’s what I do with novels. There’re no novels that I like to read so I write my own novels, and then I read them again, and it’s the best thing.

JADEN: Willow’s been writing her own novels since she was 6.

But do your collaborative relationships inspire you in different directions?

JADEN: Totally.

WILLOW: Me and Jaden just figured out that our voices sound like chocolate together. As good as chocolate tastes, it sounds that good.

How does fashion relate to what you do?

JADEN: Willow just dropped a song (“Cares”), let me quote the lyrics: “I do not care what people say.” We both don’t really care. I like to wear things that I make, but I throw it on as though I was throwing on anything. It looks cool, sometimes.

WILLOW: I like to go to places with my high-fashion things where there are a lot of cameras. So I can just go there and be like, “Yep, yep, I’m looking so sick.” But in my regular life, I put on clothes that I can climb trees in.

What are the things worth having?

JADEN: Something that’s worth buying to me is like Final Cut Pro or Logic.

WILLOW: A canvas. Paint. A microphone.

JADEN: Anything that you can shock somebody with. The only way to change something is to shock it. If you want your muscles to grow, you have to shock them. If you want society to change, you have to shock them.

WILLOW: That’s what art is, shocking people. Sometimes shocking yourself.

You mentioned breathing earlier, and it’s also an idea that recurs in your songs.

WILLOW: Breathing is meditation; life is a meditation. You have to breathe in order to live, so breathing is how you get in touch with the sacred space of your heart.

JADEN: When babies are born, their soft spots bump: It has, like, a heartbeat in it. That’s because energy is coming through their body, up and down.

WILLOW: Prana energy.

JADEN: It’s prana energy because they still breathe through their stomach. They remember. Babies remember.

WILLOW: When they’re in the stomach, they’re so aware, putting all their bones together, putting all their ligaments together. But they’re shocked by this harsh world.

JADEN: By the chemicals and things, and then slowly…

WILLOW: As they grow up, they start losing.

JADEN: You know, they become just like us.

So is the hardest education the unlearning of things?

WILLOW: Yes, basically, but the crazy thing is it doesn’t have to be like that.

JADEN: Here’s the deal: School is not authentic because it ends. It’s not true, it’s not real. Our learning will never end. The school that we go to every single morning, we will continue to go to.

WILLOW: Forever, ‘til the day that we’re in our bed.

JADEN: Kids who go to normal school are so teenagery, so angsty.

WILLOW: They never want to do anything, they’re so tired.

JADEN: You never learn anything in school. Think about how many car accidents happen every day. Driver’s ed? What’s up? I still haven’t been to driver’s ed because if everybody I know has been in an accident, I can’t see how driver’s ed is really helping them out.

WILLOW: I went to school for one year. It was the best experience but the worst experience. The best experience because I was, like, “Oh, now I know why kids are so depressed.” But it was the worst experience because I was depressed.

So what’s next?

JADEN: I have a goal to be just the most craziest person of all time. And when I say craziest, I mean, like, I want to do like Olympic-level things. I want to be the most durable person on the planet.

WILLOW: I think by the time we’re 30 or 20, we’re going to be climbing as many mountains as we can possibly climb.
Willow’s “3″ is available now on iTunes. Jaden’s “Cool Tapes Vol. 2″ will be available beginning at 12 a.m. with the download of his new app called Jaden Experience.[Jaden Smith - Verse 1]
Your motion
Got me rollercoastin
I want all in your ocean
Man look it when I goes in
I have no friends
But if you had seen where we came
You would know that we’re just makin a name
Just off Deck and we straight to a plane
Man, I’m insane
This ain’t a game
Half of you jokers don’t hear what I’m sayin
But this is real, I’m feelin pain
All of the things, I don’t say them in vain
Great as a dane, you in my domain
I can be Batman and you could be Bane
Fast as a train, sharp as a brain
I am a poet, I do not explain
These are my feelings, I don’t entertain
Keepin it plain, my take, it look like I’m me
You don’t know what I attain
When I drop flame
I knew I conquered the game
All of these jokers are lame
So tell them to stay in they lane
I spit the fire, you out of the frame
I’m killing em dang man, you thought I would lose?
Who’s this kid with the Louie V shoes?
That would be me and I’m here with my crew
And you not so I think I’mma need a masseuse
Boom, man this what I do
No paper, no pad
Here with my girl and these jokers are mad
You got GPS? Cuz It could’t been bad
I would’ve been lost

[Willow Smith - Hook]
Lost...
In space and I see your face on Mars
No trace but I find you in them stars
I’ll chase you til this planet falls
Lil mama got bars, Lil mama got bars

(Chorus x2)
You stare into my eyes, I know you hear my cries
‘Cause you look at the sky
You wanna fly? I got the kite
I got the kite for you to fly

(Verse)
I gave you kisses on yo neck
And chilled after my curfew
I treat you with respect
And girl I never would hurt you
But now, I’m with my G’s
Skatin these streets, baby I’m killin this beat
Fly like the birds and the bees
Please, go get some Z’s
Roll up my sleeves, go to the cosmos
Come back and got a new God flow
Gotta find one in Kabo
Until these jokers know I ain’t macho
No, I’m straight from the basas, I’m skippin my classes
These jokers slow as molasses
My song is massive
Wanna know where all the trash is? Visit them ratchets
Fly as Aladdin, I am so cool you could call me Alaskan
I am the freshest, there’s no point in askin
Live on the edge and you’ll live in your casket
I am the baddest yea
And I’m gon find me a actress
With long hair, nice skin, does backflips
And red lips and she don’t need chapstick
But I’mma be here with my clan
Soon as you land, you got flowers in your hand
Come to the beach, get a tan
Lay in the sand, baby you hot as a pan
Come with the tightest bikini, you eat the Panini cuz baby you can
I’ll be your genie cuz I am your man
Say that I’m dreamin, you hear me like damn
You got me lost

(Bridge)
Lost in space and I see your face on Mars
No trace but I find you in them stars
I’ll chase you til this planet falls
Lil mama got bar, lil mama got bars

(Chorus x2)
You stare into my eyes, I know you hear my cries
‘Cause you look at the sky
You wanna fly? I got the kite
I got the kite for you to fly

Lost
Lost
Lost
