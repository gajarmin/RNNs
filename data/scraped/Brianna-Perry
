I buy the buck sun dress, but never buy the biddy
Never by the biddy when your chick is go getty
Watchin' J Fiddy Fiddy, ever since I was a kiddy
And I knew that I would make it cause the hustle is just in me
And these rappers all actors, man, they needa' get some Emmmy's
And these dudes takin' shots, I think I better grab my semi, POW
You on my old line, I got a new phone
And everything I rap about, I mean I do own

Dope flow, Bri song
Probably just skiin' in my beach home, probably got Marilyn Monroe as your ringtone
B Class eras, hold the keys to the kingdom
Talk about nothin', man they rap for no reason
Me in Miami, walk around like I'm freezing
Lookin' at my back, think it's fat, think it's Big Sean
Breezy like Chris, like Bosh, be a big shot
And I a'int end the verse, like an NBA LockoutI'm HollyHood

Dolla signs all I see is dolla signs
From your head to to the floor million dolla signs
And you look like the racks on racks to me
Dolla signs thats all that i could see
Dolla signs, all I see is dolla signs
Soon as I wake up all I see is dolla signs
DDDolla signs DDDolla signs
Is you on my mind? yep you a dolla signs

[Verse 1:Brianna Perry]
DDDolla signs, All I see is dolla signs
Capital S with the two lines
Birkin bag with the boot shine
That Jag and the coupe mine
Designer leggings on my behind
How you gone hand me one dolla bitch
Im in the club with ten dimes
Rollie watch.......BP, ready?
Live from the bad bitch headquarters
Birthing these hoes, I got four daughters
I'm the realest, what I got to show for it
Let Jesus take the will, and I'll show for it!
Peter Piper pick Perry the Push
But I'm the shit, no SPEAK or flush
And now I don't mean to be over their heads
Running, spitting the verses like I'm bunking the beds
Bounce, I could put you late for a stand by
Don't need security, I move like a samurai!
Broke and envious, they're looking with a green eye
I don't roll up, but I ain't high!
Paparazzi, that's what the fame buy
Suited for the game, but it's no tie!

Hook:

Reporting live from the jungle
Now how many real hoes wanna rumble?
Reporting live from the jungle

Wanna rumble with the beat, huh, huh, huh?
Wanna rumble with the beat, huh, huh, huh?

Never stop, never bow
Can't school me with financial holds
I was bump beneath, I was copping hoes
(See again) It's my time so I'm clocking hoes
You can only do what I let you
Who the fuck are you to say I never impressed you?
Filthy mouth, need POTTY TRAINING
The menace I'm, I could tell from my body LANGUAGE
Anybody could get it, ask'
When I hum for the crown, bitches better bow down
Cause I'm only 21 with a hell of a style
I'm in the bank, you in denial!
I'm too nice to ever PLAY nice
Give advice, look at the bigger picture not the likes!
If you nigga a ho then you a dyke
I'm provocative but they don't wanna fight

My appearance don't need no clearance
Good critic, nothing in the name of my appearance
Check my balance, check my merits
I can't be broke like 7 (divide that!)
Get pimping, man, he in the peddy!
Keep yourself together, bitch, that's peddy!
I can't socialize with chicks, that's peddy
Fine women like me, pink plenty (noup)
Ain't many, my ego ain't many
All head stincky, respect gotta get me
Rap then again, too many gimmicking
I just put the words to the beat, but I ain't industry!
