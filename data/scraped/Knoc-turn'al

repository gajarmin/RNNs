[MC Ren]
Yeah nigga, MC Ren up in this motherfucker
(West West y'all)
Yeah, L.A. niggas
L.A. niggas rule the world nigga
Y'all niggas gotta recognize, yaknahmsayin?
Niggas don't wanna peep game, yaknahmsayin?
But this shit come all the way back around here
My nigga Dre, droppin' heat box on y'all bitch-ass
Yaknahmsayin? You gotta recognize
L.A. niggas, connected all over the motherfucking world, nigga
Recognize this; peep game

[Time Bomb]
Now in my younger days I used to sport a rag
Backpack full of cans plus a four-four mag
G'd up from the feet up
Blue'd up from the shoe up's how I grew up
Loc'n, smokin' and drinkin' til we threw up (threw up)
At Leimert Park, taggin', hittin' fools up
Ditching my class, just to fuck yo' school up
You don't wanna blast, nigga tuck yo' tool up
But don't sleep, y'all niggas quick to shoot you
Now there's another motherfucker with no future
But Time Bomb much smoother when I maneuver, dope like Cuba
Got em jumpin Disciples to the Hoover

[King T]
I'm coming "Straight Outta Compton" with a loose cannon
Smoke big green, call it Bruce Banner
Watch your manners, at last another blast from the top notch
From way back with the pop rocks, I pop lock witcha
Picture this, Dr. Dre twisting wit Tha Liks
And Hittman bought a fix
Don't trip, it's a Time Bomb in this bitch
Here it tick tick tick tick {*BOOM*}
Wait a minute it's on, I tell it like a true mackadelic
Weed and cocaine sold separate, check it
From sundown to sunup -- clown and run up
The Aftermath'll be two in your gut, nigga what?

Chorus: Knoc-Turn'al, Kokane

We roll deep, smoke on weed drink and pack heat
Requirements for survival each day -- in L.A.!
It don't stop, we still mash in hot pursuit from the cops
Analyze why we act this way -- in L.A.!

[Hittman]
Gimme that mic fool, it's a West coast jack move
They call me Hitt - cause I spit like gats do
Cock me back
Bust caps for my Macz Crew, at Fairfax
Who used to wear Air Max shoes, that's true
But I grew up where niggas jack you, harass you
Blast you, for that set you claim (where you from?)
Mash on you for your Turkish chain, C.K. B.K
Blue'd up or flame, I ran wit a gang
I helped niggas get, jacked for they Dana Dane's
My pants hang below my waistline
I look humble wanna rumble? (yeah yeah)
I bang though, like Vince Carter from the baseline
Don't waste my time
Fuck a scrap in killa Cali, AK's and 9's
One-time's, sun-shines, and fine-ass bitches
Hawaiian Thai, drive-bys, six-fo's on switches

[Xzibit]
I was raised in the hood called WHAT-THE-DIF'
Where the brothers in the hood, refused to go Hollywood
Slugs for the fuck of it
Anybody hatin' on us can suck a dick
If I catch you touching mine you catch a flat-line, dead on the floor
Better than yours, driving away gettin' head from a whore
It's AvireX-to-the-Z
Fuckin' with me might get you banned from TV
Cassette and CD it's all mine the whole nine the right time
Multiply, we don't die, the streets don't lie
What, so neither do I, I'm bad for your health
Like puttin' a pistol up to your face and blastin' yourself

[Defari]
Five in the mornin', burglars at my do'
Glock forty-five in my dresser drawer
Let 'em come in BLAOW he see the thunder roll
Roll with niggas, who buy fifths by the fo'
And brew's by the case
SLAP YOU in the face with the bass, Dr. Dre laced
Likwit Kings wit Sedans and gold rings
Haters fold the style, but can't find no openings

Chorus

[Outro]
In L.A

That's how we ride (4X)[Hook] x2
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Everyday it's the same thing, L.A. ain't changed
Niggas still playa hating, but Dre ain't changed
I'm just a lot smarter now
Cause these niggas is banging ten times harder now
Niggas bringing they ass up in the wrong part of town
Better turn their car around
Rolling the window down (Hey can we talk it out?)
(Nah, get the fuck out!)
Johnny got a shotgun
And he ain't even strong enough to cock one
Fuck trying to job hunt
Niggas got AK's
Niggas is way crazier than Dre was back in his N.W.A. days
Niggas spray strays and shoot without looking
Niggas walk by and blast, without leaving a footprint
I think the attitudes are twice as worst
It takes half the time to get your life reversed
Always trying to play Rambo with they ammo
Make a nigga wanna stay in family mode

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Knoc-turn'al]
Late nights is full of lead that whistles as it goes by
Murder arrives, anytime
Bullets take flight when the fo'-five ignites
Some hearts skip a beat, some get blew out, and never re-light
With you in the site of youngsters with automatics
Busting on shit to lay everything down even tourists and non-affiliates
These days, gun play is official with green lights on every block
And though the sign tells you too it's not best to stop
On every corner, Cali niggas are dumping
You'll be shaking your soul loose from the box at the coroner's
Making death not so foreign to ya
Niggas got Rugers and M14's with enough ammo to leave
An armored truck Swiss cheese
I've learned to stay away from house parties
I've seen too many go and end up absent without leaving
Ain't no warm welcomings
My eyes have witnessed the bend in on
Nights that don't sleep, and fireworks until dawn

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Hittman]
Now tell me, what the fuck is this man?
Niggas doing brothers in worse than the Klan
Can't even stand in front of your building and chill without yielding
Twelve year old children that kill, blood spilling
Thugs be illing, unnecessary slugs filling the sky
Usually drilling the one that wasn't willing to die
Yes sir, in the Killing Field I got my
Life preserver, and I'll do my time for murder
These niggas got the nerve to
Question me 'bout the colors that I got on?
I see that red dot on your knot
'Bout to get your whole crew shot on
A Soldier of Fortune, I'm the wrong man to plot on
Took him out on the spot before he even got on
My hit list, peep this
I cock back, you bow down, bust round, bloody the ground
Retaliation sounds like this

[Hook] (x2)[Dr. Dre]
Put your cups up, get your smoke in
Baby, we partying, ain't nobody loc'n
Who you provoking, what you want now?
Take a look around, it's pimp shit goin down
It's a lot of bitches, a whole lot of freaks
Top notch hoes, they flock in every week
What you wan' do, get your next thrill
Take an X pill, how the sex feel?
Damn you lookin good, all ten of y'all
Wwanna roll (yeaaah!), I'm dicking y'all
Keep your face down, keep your ass up
You know what your doing, keep that shit moving
Keep them titties jumping, keep the Henny coming
Every bitch in here need to be touching something
I know they like it hot, that's why I keep it hot
So how the fuck could they not want a piece of Doc?

[Hook: Knoc-turn'al]
I don't give a fuck cause I'm just
Drinkin, smokin, straight West-coasting
Bitches puttin ass in motion
Pussy poppin, sex promotin
Got a cup? [Raise it up]
Got a blunt? [Blaze it up]
That's your bitch? [On these nuts]
Really I don't...[Give a fuck]
All I really know is your ho wants to be with me, and she ain't playin
And what I'm sayin (she creeps with me)
And sleeps, between the sheets

[Dr. Dre]
Soon as the door close
I make 'em curl toes, they all wanna get chose
We never love y'all, my niggas all macks
We sip a lot of Yak, fuck and never call back
Pack women in the club until it's pitch black
Thugs on their block wonderin where their bitch at
Where you think nigga? She with the Aftermath
Called her house, she ain't home, she with Aftermath
No talkin, fuck how your day go
You want dick (yeeeaah!), will bitch say so
Don't be shy now, probably the best at it
They say a party ain't a party until the west at it
Gravitate to the Doc like it's automatic
Take your clothes off, make me wanna grab it
Turn around with it, make me wanna stab it (yeaah)
Time to get it crackin, show me them bad habits (oooh)

[Hook]

[Knoc-turn'al]
When she's all alone she sneaks out to be with me
And what I'm sayin is she ain't playin (she creeps with me)
And sleeps, between the sheets

[Dr. Dre]
Yeah, Aftermath, Doc Dre, 5-star surgeon general (yeaaah!)
Nocturnal, L.A. Confidential (yeaaah!)
What up Infinite, Mahagony droppin the instrumental (yeaaah!)
Do the math, Aftermath gets the last laugh (yeaaah!)[Samuel Christian]
You ready?

[Knoc-Turn'al]
Yes, ha ha ha
Yeah, yeah
Let's go, I like singing

[Knoc-Turn'al]
My music, my life, my heart, my soul
My music, my everything, I give my all
My wife, my daughter, my love, my dream
My mother, my father, my brother, my team
My camp, my squad, my house, my car
My boat, my shoes, my pants, my shirt
My coke, my sugar, my cream, my butter
My toast, my all, my queen, my folks

[Hook: Samuel Christian]
My baby! Walk like six strings
Talk like she's my everything
My baby! Loves me, hates me
Leaves me, runs right back
That sexy lady! All I know
She shares all my confusion, so
My baby! Will not run from an-y-thing
I swear this though

[Knoc-Turn'al talking]
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If Muzik should die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take

[Knoc-Turn'al]
She's thick, she's bad, so clean, she's fine
She loves, she hates, she laughs, she cries
She hurts, she lies, she's Bonnie, I'm Clyde
She's ghetto, she's real, she sings, she rhymes
She comes, she goes, she lives, she dies
She sexy and bomb, she blows my mind
She stays in line, she's smart, she's funny
She's crafty and cunning, in the game she's running
Her lips, her back, her waist, her thighs
Her face, her skin, her hair, her eyes
Her voice, her shape, her hips, her mind
Her love, her smile, her touch, her time

[Hook]

[Knoc-Turn'al]
I'm tipsy, I'm through, I'm drunk, I'm blunted
My way, my day, my life - I love it
I move, I groove, I shake, I love it
My friends, my kins, I like, I love it
I show, I prove, I live, I learn
I show, I teach, I run these streets
My kin, my heart, my heat, my rhythm
My rap, my beat, my life, my head and my feet
My heart, my soul, my candy, my cake
My platinum, my gold, my land, my gate
My Benz, my lake
My keys, my money, my love, my hate
My clothes, my phone, my house, my home
My money, my comb, my sugar, my spice
My base, my chrome
My rhythm, my music, my home
My world, my girl, my life, my home, my...

[Hook] - repeat until fade[Intro]
Yeah... Uh!
Lil Drift
Take three
Yo!

[Verse 1]
Once more, yeah I’m back on the map
I’m ready to spit another verse for this collection of tracks
Y’all don’t really know why I do this crap
Why I spit on beats and why I shit on raps
Why I flow in a rhythm you ain’t ever heard
Manipulate the English language and I twist every word
Why I flow in metaphors that you don’t comprehend
So you say my rhymes are simple when really you’re just lame
Nosy ass fucks, keep your nose out of my business
My name out your mouth, and your eyes off of my riches
I’m a veteran in the game, you just a new recruit
That’s why you’re after my rhymes like a hot pursuit
I was schoolin kids when my flow was still off
So sick, I could take you out with only one cough
I don’t affiliate with half of these actors
Cuz they’re a talentless bunch that call themselves “rappers”
The other half a bunch of no good liars
Bragging about money and about being suppliers
When they can’t even pay their own damn light bill
Sleeping on the floor and can’t wake up from that nightmare
I’m The Watcher of the game, put out their misery
I been dominating rhymes since 2003
I got stripes like Cincinnati
And to stop me, I guess you have to try and kill me
Or something, cuz my reign in the game will never cease
I lay rappers out like my Nikes when they crease
Toe tag and body bag whenever they want peace
Because instead of peace, I pull out a piece
Hip-Hop is unhealthy, it’s become obese
I feel it slowly falling apart, piece by piece
The decrease of intelligence is extravagant
Because these idiots’ numbers are set to increase
What I write might be the best you’ve ever heard
Depending on who you ask and nowadays what’s preferred
Don’t pretend to be the best, I could never act
I just vent on paper and let it flow in raps
Royaltie about to show you what’s really good
Don’t get it twisted, just get it understood
It’s the watcher

[Hook] (Truth Hurts)
I know, you got your eyes on me, I feel you watching me
But it ain't hard to see that you can't see me
You try, but what you think you saw, ain't what you thought you saw
You better off not looking at all
(Everywhere that I go, ain't the same as before
People I used to know, just don't know me no more
But everywhere that I go, I got people I know
Who got people they know, so I suggest you lay low)[MC Ren]
Yeah nigga, MC Ren up in this motherfucker
(West West y'all)
Yeah, L.A. niggas
L.A. niggas rule the world nigga
Y'all niggas gotta recognize, yaknahmsayin?
Niggas don't wanna peep game, yaknahmsayin?
But this shit come all the way back around here
My nigga Dre, droppin heat box on y'all bitch-ass
Yaknahmsayin? You gotta recognize
L.A. niggas, connected all over the motherfuckin world, nigga
Recognize this

[Time Bomb]
Now in my younger days I used to sport a rag
Backpack full of cans plus a four-four mag
G'd from the feet up
Blued up from the sewer's how I grew up
Loc'n, smokin and drinkin til we threw up (threw up)
At Leimert Park, taggin, hittin fools up
Ditchin my class, just to fuck yo' school up
You don't wanna blast, nigga tuck yo' tool up
But don't sleep, y'all niggas quick to shoot you

But Time Bomb much smoother when I manuever, dope like Cuba
Got em jumpin {*King T starts speakin, indecipherable*}

[Outro]
In L.A

That's how we ride (4X)[Intro - Knoc-turn'al - talking]
Yes
I'ma do me
I'ma do me
You gon' do you
You gon' do you
I'ma do me
I'ma do me (yes)
You gon' do you
You gon' do you
I'ma do me
I'ma do me

[Verse 1 - Knoc-turn'al]
I, I've been ridin for five years with D-R-E
You minor, I'm major league
But what y'all didn't expect to see
Is me on TV with Snoop D-O double G
Smoke weed, get a buzz, show a young G love
If you don't give a fuck (what?)
Put your hands up (what?)
Party like it should be done
You leavin at 2 girl? You know the night's just begun
The after hours spot is off the hook
The ugly crows buy the bottle of Crook
The fly crows keep smokin the kush
So you know I got a bird and a bush
You run up, you get stomped and mushed
Look it here, I talk to God, I don't pray
When I want somethin, I don't play
It's Knoc-turn'al with a capital K
Best believe it's a brand new day
And if you feel me sunshine, come around my way

[Chorus - Knoc-turn'al]
Put your hands up, come off them grams
I ain't trippin that's the way I am (the way I am)
And if you see me with heat in my hand
You better duck that's the way I am (the way I am)
I can't believe ya got up in them pants
Sexy lady gon' do that dance (*breathing noises*)
Come on over when your sick of ya man
And we can chill that's the way I am (the way I am)

[Verse 2 - Snoop Dogg]
Light blue shoes (shoes), dark blue pants (uh)
Four, five bitches and they all wanna dance
I don't get down bitch, that ain't my program
I don't hold hands and I don't slow jam (uh uh)
I sleep walk in the park with the fellas
And make suckers jealous cause they can't out sell us
You wanna join us? Well here's a few pointers
About them riders from the state of California
(Knoc-turn'al), knock on wood
Eastside, LB, shit it's all too good
In the hood, he's so "Confidential"
With the way that we get you and the shit that I hit you
And spit you, split you, sit you down
Click, cock, pop at you, rock you and knock you down
Pimp slap you and sock you down
Lifestyles of the motherfuckin Dogg Pound, now (*echo*)

[Chorus]

[Break - Knoc-turn'al]
I don't know that girl I just met her
Sippin on sour Amoretta
She gon' do her thing if I let her
But I'ma bounce cause her friend looks better
I like the way she knows me
I like the way she got herself in V.I.P
If she sees K-N-O-C
She gon' chill and wait out front for me

[Verse 3 - Knoc-turn'al]
Who do you know that rides for the coast
With a new breed and style of rap like me?
I had the patience to study the game
Dr. Dre made two Chronics and this is Chronic Three
I make classic hits and buy classic cars
And see classic hoes at classic bars
(Now I just step in the spot and the girls all pause)
Magic stick, I break down walls
Got my heat if some shit jumps off
Really you steppin to me is a lost cause
Party animal, here since a quarter to ten
Babyface, six-two with a L.A. brim
I got shell toes on, I don't wear them Timbs
I got hoes, got weed, and a gallon of gin
Ain't no tellin what I might get in
The first night, do it right, I'ma do it again
C'mon

[Chorus] - 2X

[Outro - Knoc-turn'al - talking]
You know where we be, in da club
Come find me, I ain't trippin
Air is free, so what ever you wanna do
For real though
Huh, it's just the way I am[Dr. Dre]
Put your cups up, get your smoke in
Baby, we partying, ain't nobody loc'n
Who you provoking, what you want now?
Take a look around, it's pimp shit goin down

Thugs on their block wonderin where their bitch at
Where you think nigga? She with the Aftermath
Called her house, she ain't home, she with Aftermath
No talkin, fuck how your day go
You want dick (yeeeaah!), will bitch say so
Don't be shy now, probably the best at it

Gravitate to the Doc like it's automatic
Take your clothes off, make me wanna grab it
Turn around with it, make me wanna stab it (yeaah)
Time to get it crackin, show me them bad habits (oooh)

[Knoc-turn'al]
When she's all alone she sneaks out to be with me

Yeah, Aftermath, Doc Dre, 5-star surgeon general (yeaaah!)

Busting on shit to lay everything down even tourists and non-affiliates

And though the sign tells you too it's not best to stop
On every corner, Cali niggas are dumping
You'll be shaking your soul loose from the box at the coroner's
Making death not so foreign to ya
Niggas got Rugers and M14's with enough ammo to leave
An armored truck Swiss cheese
I've learned to stay away from house parties
I've seen too many go and end up absent without leaving
Ain't no warm welcomings
My eyes have witnessed the bend in on
Nights that don't sleep, and fireworks until dawn

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Hittman]
Now tell me, what the fuck is this man?
Niggas doing brothers in worse than the Klan
Can't even stand in front of your building and chill without yielding
Twelve year old children that kill, blood spilling

Yes sir, in the Killing Field I got my

Took him out on the spot before he even got on
My hit list, peep this
I cock back, you bow down, bust round, bloody the ground
Retaliation sounds like this

[Hook] (x2)[Intro: Knoc-Turn'al]
Now that's cool
You know
I chill wit ch'all though a little bit
Fuck the ???
I ain't give a fuck about that nigga
And he came hittin my weed
He came drinkin my Hen'
Matter fact if I see him in traffic, even though y'all fuck with him
It's on

[Hook: Knoc-Turn'al]
All lights are on
This is for the G in me, let's go (let's go)
Bitch I party all ?with me? (get it crackin in this motherfucker)
Lights out
I'll give you everything you need, and more

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
On the mic I been a demon since semen
Have you screamin': Oh mama, here come that young O'Sama
With that Al-Quaida drama
Fuck no, it's the Dalai Lama
With that West World Order
Now MC's Bow Down and treat me like Yoda
When they catch me in the corner at the club
Like "nigga what", they throw up the dub
So you can tell Samuel L. I'mma keep ac'in
You can even tell that motherfucker Jesse Jackson
Pay your child support, keep your payments up
Put a rubber on and don't fuck with us

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Mack 10]
Mack pull up in the rag, Chevy layed the ass
And crumble green on a Zig-Zag and lace it with hash
I keep a 9mm cocked and ready to blast
So when the phone jump off a nigga ready to smash
I drink my 'gnac out the bottle
I don't fuck with a glass
And I ain't set tripping dog, that's a thing of the past
And I stay in good shape so my stamina last
And put hands on a motherfucker bout my cash
I was a stick up kid, I snatch your chain and dash
And if the pawn shop wanted it, I downed it fast
Or I'm creeping through your window breaking out your glass
Then I rob the whole party looking through a ski-mask, c'mon

[Hook]

[Verse 3: W.C.]
From the land of the Lakers, bird brakers, Impala pedals
While we chop dollars with those in sombreros
It's the check a ho, when the cutlass checkin doe
So so ghetto Dub S rep the (ball/boat)
Ball gritty but a group of hogs with me
And V.I.P. yo from mad dog 20/20
Dub C. chucking up the 23rd alphabetical
Steel swiss hanging like a testicle
Lick 1, 2 to the nose my bump was [?]
Take a picture trick my foe's posing like the Heisman
I'm burnin money, trying to slide some in your tummy
Keep your panties gummy, have you walkin funny, trick

[Hook x 2][MC Ren]
Yeah nigga, MC Ren up in this motherfucker
(West West y'all)
Yeah, L.A. niggas
L.A. niggas rule the world nigga
Y'all niggas gotta recognize, yaknahmsayin?
Niggas don't wanna peep game, yaknahmsayin?
But this shit come all the way back around here
My nigga Dre, droppin' heat box on y'all bitch-ass
Yaknahmsayin? You gotta recognize
L.A. niggas, connected all over the motherfucking world, nigga
Recognize this; peep game

[Time Bomb]
Now in my younger days I used to sport a rag
Backpack full of cans plus a four-four mag
G'd up from the feet up
Blue'd up from the shoe up's how I grew up
Loc'n, smokin' and drinkin' til we threw up (threw up)
At Leimert Park, taggin', hittin' fools up
Ditching my class, just to fuck yo' school up
You don't wanna blast, nigga tuck yo' tool up
But don't sleep, y'all niggas quick to shoot you
Now there's another motherfucker with no future
But Time Bomb much smoother when I maneuver, dope like Cuba
Got em jumpin Disciples to the Hoover

[King T]
I'm coming "Straight Outta Compton" with a loose cannon
Smoke big green, call it Bruce Banner
Watch your manners, at last another blast from the top notch
From way back with the pop rocks, I pop lock witcha
Picture this, Dr. Dre twisting wit Tha Liks
And Hittman bought a fix
Don't trip, it's a Time Bomb in this bitch
Here it tick tick tick tick {*BOOM*}
Wait a minute it's on, I tell it like a true mackadelic
Weed and cocaine sold separate, check it
From sundown to sunup -- clown and run up
The Aftermath'll be two in your gut, nigga what?

Chorus: Knoc-Turn'al, Kokane

We roll deep, smoke on weed drink and pack heat
Requirements for survival each day -- in L.A.!
It don't stop, we still mash in hot pursuit from the cops
Analyze why we act this way -- in L.A.!

[Hittman]
Gimme that mic fool, it's a West coast jack move
They call me Hitt - cause I spit like gats do
Cock me back
Bust caps for my Macz Crew, at Fairfax
Who used to wear Air Max shoes, that's true
But I grew up where niggas jack you, harass you
Blast you, for that set you claim (where you from?)
Mash on you for your Turkish chain, C.K. B.K
Blue'd up or flame, I ran wit a gang
I helped niggas get, jacked for they Dana Dane's
My pants hang below my waistline
I look humble wanna rumble? (yeah yeah)
I bang though, like Vince Carter from the baseline
Don't waste my time
Fuck a scrap in killa Cali, AK's and 9's
One-time's, sun-shines, and fine-ass bitches
Hawaiian Thai, drive-bys, six-fo's on switches

[Xzibit]
I was raised in the hood called WHAT-THE-DIF'
Where the brothers in the hood, refused to go Hollywood
Slugs for the fuck of it
Anybody hatin' on us can suck a dick
If I catch you touching mine you catch a flat-line, dead on the floor
Better than yours, driving away gettin' head from a whore
It's AvireX-to-the-Z
Fuckin' with me might get you banned from TV
Cassette and CD it's all mine the whole nine the right time
Multiply, we don't die, the streets don't lie
What, so neither do I, I'm bad for your health
Like puttin' a pistol up to your face and blastin' yourself

[Defari]
Five in the mornin', burglars at my do'
Glock forty-five in my dresser drawer
Let 'em come in BLAOW he see the thunder roll
Roll with niggas, who buy fifths by the fo'
And brew's by the case
SLAP YOU in the face with the bass, Dr. Dre laced
Likwit Kings wit Sedans and gold rings
Haters fold the style, but can't find no openings

Chorus

[Outro]
In L.A

Yaknahmsayin? You gotta recognize
L.A. niggas, connected all over the motherfuckin world, nigga
Recognize this

[Time Bomb]
Now in my younger days I used to sport a rag
Backpack full of cans plus a four-four mag

Blued up from the sewer's how I grew up

At Leimert Park, taggin, hittin fools up
Ditchin my class, just to fuck yo' school up
You don't wanna blast, nigga tuck yo' tool up

[Dr.D] Who make hits? (Dre)

[Knoc-turn'al]
Who we wit? (Knoc)
Westcoast parties don't stop
Who drop head-boppers? (The head doctor, bed-rocker)
Police pursue me in squad cars and helicopters
Checkin lockers, Mexican connect to play soccer
PH's and cockblockers
Ho-hoppers, weez niggas is off the rocker
Sippin cranberry juice on rocks with vodka
With 'Pac and Poppa, and Redd Foxx's doctor (for real?)
Takin names and takin orders
Ya fake ya name, and I'm all up on ya
Nigga that's Cali-fornia
Palm trees and 6-3's on deez
Rims dip to make the spokes gold-a
Slangin boulders, thought I told ya
True soldiers, comin from the motherfuckin shoulders (WOOP!)

[Hook: Missy Elliott]
Take it ea-say! (ea-say)
Cuz it's the motherfuckin KNOC!
Hotter than yo' block fulla motherfuckin COPS!
Bow down when ya see me!
Knoc the truth best believe it!
Take it ea-say! (ea-say)
Cuz it's the motherfuckin KNOC!
Hotter than a freak who givin head who won't STOP!
Bow down when ya pass thru!
Knoc-turn'al God damn you!

[Knoc-turn'al]
What's the difference between us? (Nah not that again)
New songs, and new cars, and new broads, and new thongs
On Crenshaw Boulevard - Line 'em up at the bar
Girl you know who we are, hip-hop superstars
Roll deep? Nah, we roll hard and deep
Bogart yo beef get the fuck off my street
Getcha motherfuckin ass beat
L.A., Compton, Long Beach, whooptie-whoop nigga what?
I don't give a fuck
Hustlers, hood-rats, sick-ass thugs - Crips and Bloods
(Hell nigg-uh!) All my real niggas raise it up
Nuttin but dubs, you got a sack, nigga what?
Blaze it up

[Hook: Missy Elliott]

[Knoc-turn'al]
Bitch you ain't 'bout shit, my bad
Turn off the lights, don't trip
Give a nig' some ack right and act like..
You might.. lick balls tonight
Girls all pause, hell nah, girls drop draws on site
Do drugs, shroom cups, smoke bud, all night
That's right, I like.. bi-sexual women, fuck dykes
Suck dick? No, but your father might
Fuckin hermaphrodite!
Duck the IRS, fuckin Howard Stern's wife
In traffic, bitch gave me head in real life
L.A. city lights, C.A. get it right
Westcoast on the grind, these niggas done lost they minds
Straight loungin in the sunshine
Here's one thing you bitch niggas must know
Fuck you! Please believe that, and I mean that

[Hook: Missy Elliott][Intro]
Yeah... Uh!
Lil Drift
Take three
Yo!

[Verse 1]
Once more, yeah I’m back on the map
I’m ready to spit another verse for this collection of tracks
Y’all don’t really know why I do this crap
Why I spit on beats and why I shit on raps
Why I flow in a rhythm you ain’t ever heard
Manipulate the English language and I twist every word
Why I flow in metaphors that you don’t comprehend
So you say my rhymes are simple when really you’re just lame
Nosy ass fucks, keep your nose out of my business
My name out your mouth, and your eyes off of my riches
I’m a veteran in the game, you just a new recruit
That’s why you’re after my rhymes like a hot pursuit
I was schoolin kids when my flow was still off
So sick, I could take you out with only one cough
I don’t affiliate with half of these actors
Cuz they’re a talentless bunch that call themselves “rappers”
The other half a bunch of no good liars
Bragging about money and about being suppliers
When they can’t even pay their own damn light bill
Sleeping on the floor and can’t wake up from that nightmare
I’m The Watcher of the game, put out their misery
I been dominating rhymes since 2003
I got stripes like Cincinnati
And to stop me, I guess you have to try and kill me
Or something, cuz my reign in the game will never cease
I lay rappers out like my Nikes when they crease
Toe tag and body bag whenever they want peace
Because instead of peace, I pull out a piece
Hip-Hop is unhealthy, it’s become obese
I feel it slowly falling apart, piece by piece
The decrease of intelligence is extravagant
Because these idiots’ numbers are set to increase
What I write might be the best you’ve ever heard
Depending on who you ask and nowadays what’s preferred
Don’t pretend to be the best, I could never act
I just vent on paper and let it flow in raps
Royaltie about to show you what’s really good
Don’t get it twisted, just get it understood
It’s the watcher

[Hook] (Truth Hurts)
I know, you got your eyes on me, I feel you watching me
But it ain't hard to see that you can't see me
You try, but what you think you saw, ain't what you thought you saw
You better off not looking at all
(Everywhere that I go, ain't the same as before
People I used to know, just don't know me no more
But everywhere that I go, I got people I know
Who got people they know, so I suggest you lay low)DO NOT ANNOTATE THIS SONG UNTIL IT HAS BEEN FULLY TRANSCRIBED!!!

[Intro: Dr. Dre]
What the fuck
This shit banging
Hey my nigga Mel-Man told me
If you throw a rock at a pack of bitch-ass niggas
The only one who’s gon’ scream out is the one who got hit
So you know what, fuck all you niggas
You, you and you
You know

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Well it’s the D-R, D-R-E (?)
Keep it hot as hell up in LA city
Fuck a gang, only (set?) I fear
Rolling fifties, cause they can get me
For this heat I’m holding with me
My golden (?) a hole in your head leave a
Put that ass to sleep ain't talking bout the bed either
(?) the red and blue, you need to come clear like (lever?)
2000, chronic album, still smoking
For real (?)
Much ain't gotta be said to get your shit broken
Heart or jaw, I'm hard I'm raw
Nothing to prove to y'all
Just (?) down Compton Boulevard
If you didn't help me go platinum or suck my dick, you're useless
Ain't (?) thought Gatorade was baller juices
Saw the Aftermath recruits, rivals (neighbors?) wanna call truces
Try to stone us, send they harlots to seduce us
We compose (?) ballers, emcees, producers
No blues is allowed, don't be confusing the style
Chronic 2000, here and now
Bloww

[Hook: Knoc-turn'al]
(?)
Nothing left in the aftermath but dust
And niggas like us
Stay (?)
Strapped with automatics that (?)
On the West Coast with snitches and haters
Get crushed

[Verse 2: Hittman]
Man Dre
(What’s up my nigga?)
There’s too much shit in the game
They put an S in front of Hitt, trying to shit on my name
Now whoever mouth it came out of, no love
In your direction a barrage of slugs at your mug
So get bulletproof, won’t serve you as far as protection goes
It’s like bare-back and HIV-positive hoes
Hm, you know you’re gonna die
And I assume you wanna (?)
Doube-T man, see man this form of trouble could place you in R.I.P.-land
Amongst the (?), hard-players
The martyrs and the everyday prayer-sayers
Try to run shoot at your (?), make them lose air, air
Your game is over player
I’m came to make sure your jersey's retired
I’mma throw your going-away party
With a church and a choir
A hearse and a driver
I’m the gun that Dre hired nigga
Bloww

[Hook] x2
(Nigga bloww)[Slip Capone]
Mac flossy Where you at? (aaah!)
I wish they all could be California
I wish they all could be California
I wish they all could be California hoes

[Too $hort]
California bitches (Tim Dog)
Some bad hoes
Bitch you digging in the wrong dirt bitch
Ain't no gold in here
Fucking with the wrong niggas
Knoc-Turn'al, Slip Capone, Short Dog

[Slip Capone]
I knew a tight white bitch named Marianna
She lived right around the corner from Temecula
See I was bored, I fucked both of them whores before
So I called my other bitch Elsinore
She wasn't cracking so I called up Hesperia and Monrovia and Valencia
I got some pussy from Pomona and her sister Corona
It ain't nothing like them hoes in southern California
I knew a bitch named Irvine
She had a cousin with the name Santa Ana, it was short for Anaheim
I got high in Riverside with Receda and Rosarito
And Santa Clarita and [Rameda???]
I'm pleased to meet you
I've been all around the world
And with over a thousand girls
And homeboy I don't know what you have been told
But eskimo pussy is mighty cold (brrrr!)

[Hook - Slip Capone]
These hoes, these hoes, these hoes
Got cash sniffin' noses
All around the globe back to California
Everywhere I go they all up on us
These hoes, these hoes, these hoes
Got cash sniffin' noses

[Knoc-Turn'al]
You might be gold but lately I been doing the platinum pose
[Girl 1] Knoc-Turn'al's on 128 girl
[Girl 2] What? I'll be right over
Magazines choreograph me in photos
I put out with three dime pieces slamming four doors
And if I can use cities in relation to hoes
I probably fucked San Fernando's daughter, Santa Barbera
And her best friend Alameda and Sierra
And Ramona's little sister Covina
And I don't know what you thought
Whether you turned the cat in the night bitch
Still the only manipulation weapon you got
Knoc-Turn'al ain't the one to fall victim to your plots
Before I save a ho from the block
Her great grandchildren's corpses will rot
Fuck a ho
I'd rather have money and a multiple round spitting Glock
Four mansions with multiple cars investing my chips in stock
Even if I can't spell dow jones I still pull out fat knocks
It don't stop

[Hook]

[Too $hort]
They say this is a man's world
Can't understand it girl
All you ever wanted was a man like Chante Moore
You know us ballers never have one woman
And when you need us we never come running
That's why now you think about your ex again
You want to page him just to have sex with him
But instead you better call your next of kin
And complain these ballers won't let you in
She don't love you she loves money and sex
Bitches shoot you in the head for a rolex
I know the bitch is a dick fiend
I fucked her one night when she was sixteen
I know it seems like a long time ago
But I fucked her again when she was twenty four
Bitch I'm an old school vet they call me Too $hort
Look your woman in the eyes
What she do it for? Biyatch!
You know these hoes man
They'd do anything if they think it's for the money
That's why

[Hook x2]{*14 seconds of instrumental*}

[Chorus: Knawledg]
(Boom) is all you hear when I'm rollin through the city
With my top, down, so everybody hear me
(Thumpin) speakers speakers thumpin (thumpin)
Speak-speak-speakers speakers thumpin (thumpin)

[Interlude: Knawledg]
Thumpin, boom boom
Boom boom, boom

[Tash]
You got the tops down? You got the titties out? {*3X*}
You got your city out? I got my city out (L.A.!)
L.A. California that's the city I claim
When I walk down LaBrea everybody's fair game
Aimin, at L&E
Two felonies, what the fuck y'all punk niggas tellin me?
Get it poppin, everybody know CaTash droppin
I did my best work with a knife and a stocking
Cap - shut up the yap
Big dawg is back, dig it (duh-da, duh-da)
I'm a dawg, don't touch my tail
You get laid the fuck out like Chuck Liddell
From the womb to the tomb, sunny days are doomed
Knawledg in the house y'all 'bout to hear that
(Boom boom boom)

[Chorus]

[Knawledg]
Street, avenue or boulevard
Rollin in my car, speakers bangin hella hard
I don't give a FUCK~! Middle finger to the law
Listen to the subs (yeah...)
Trunk rattlin, my trunk rattlin
Every other tuner that I've been
No seat belt, with a strap
So I guess you could say that I'm still strapped in
Bump my shit in the CD deck
Hear me beatin from a block away but you can't see me yet
It's that West coast shit
For the riders in the lowriders
Roll down the window, the car look like sauna
Listen to the beat, listen when the tires skreet
You know my seat lean back, amp attached to the speaker
Fifteen inch woofers, bangin like Hoovers

[Chorus]

[Knoc-turn'al]
You fly domestic, I'm on a whole 'nother plane
Hello chihuahua, meet this great dane
You bakin soda, I'm cocaine
I like to ball - you like spare change
'member my debut shit, I said bang bang
Watch the speakers go thump (thump thump thump)
You got a lazy eye, I got straight aim
Ahh, bah-da-la-bum-bum-bum
You say you gangbang, but I know game
I'll cut you like, I'll cut you like
I don't never fall off, it's like ridin a bike
It's Knoc-turn'al baby girl I give you what you like
Don't I? I, I got a fly persona
And if you don't know ask your baby momma (momma)
I, I got a fly persona
You can keep the bullshit, I don't need the drama

[Chorus]

[Outro]
J Beam, Mathematics[Timbaland]
Come on, can you feel me now

Yo, can you feel me now

You know Knoc

Ran from me now they beg me to blow spot (what)
Meet a bitch (aha), down she go (aha)
Lick a nigga (aha), head to toe (aha)
Call me pop-a-long, back strong, grab toes
Knockin' three hoes, dippin' in the low-low (whoo)
Knoc's the weapon, Tim's the beats (the beats)
Runnin' ya country, the street block gets hot (ow)
Walk on the block and hate when niggas change face
Used to be down but now they all act fake (yeah)
Fuck 'em (what), forget 'em, leave 'em alone
Outlive 'em, purchase a home (yeah nigga)
In the zone, keep the heat on
I love to make red bones moan
Looking like zones (cause what)

[Knoc-turn'al] (Timbaland)

You can't be serious man (yes I am baby)
I (I, I, I, I, I) just wanna have fun (just wanna have fun)
You can't be serious man (yes I am baby)

[Knoc-turn'al] (Timbaland)
See me now, see me later
On the town, pimp suit, black gators
I get around, read my two-way pager
Smoke a ounce, stay out to get paper (come on)
Be out not ?, spot ? get closer
Wit game, I lace her, no rock, no chaser
Tim, Knoc, shit's over
Knockin' them, four leaf-clover
Knoc the rhythm, Tim's the bass
Shake ya ass, bones ache (whoo)
Baby I ain't done till I'm at the earthquake
Won't you calm down, chill, for heaven's sakes
Came to my home and showed up in all lace (uh)
We can get it on, freak zone, high stakes

[Knoc-turn'al] (Timbaland)
I (I, I, I, I, I) just wanna have fun (just wanna have fun)
You can't be serious man (yes I am baby)

[Knoc-turn'al]
We can go get blowed
Smoke dro and mack hoes
Leave with a few in all black tight leather
That's your girl homie, naw man I just met her
Hips and ass fully blown
Right skin, nice tone
Game tight, fully chrome
? mackster thang doing the cheap ?
No pillow, no sheets
A pro, a freak, a ho heap
Put it down, hold the ground down on your street
While I put it down and ride for L-A-C
Can handle most of the C's but can't fuck with me
I'm glad y'all feel the way I rap and ride the beat
Get your freak on, live a little, have a drink
Till the next time I bring some confidential heat

[Knoc-turn'al] (Timbaland)
I (I, I, I, I, I) just wanna have fun (just wanna have fun)

[Timbaland]
You can't be serious man
Yes I am baby, yes I am
Yes I am baby, yes I am
Yes I am baby, yes I am
You can't be serious man
What you got here, is another Timbo classic
Ya heard me? haha
Knoc-turn'al, Tim
Now you put that together
Hm, you do the math baby
Sick, sick
Sick, sick[Old Leroy & Nelson Brown talking]

[Knoc-Turn'Al]
Do you have any idea what I'm about to do to the rap game
Ain't shit changed, I'ma do my thang
If you know hustle game don't stop
It ain't about fame, it ain't about glory
It's about niggas grindin' on the block
Ain't shit changed, I'ma do my thang
If you know hustle game don't stop
It ain't about fame, it ain't about glory
It's about niggas grindin' on the block

[Old Leroy talking]

[Knoc-Turn'Al]
I'd like to send a shout out to my homeboy Warren G
Nate Dogg, Dr.Dre, Snoop Dogg
LA Confidential is definetaly in the motherfuckin house

[Old Leroy & Nelson Brown talking][Intro: Knoc-Turn' al]
Ahhh!
It's a good day in LA, yes it is (yes it is)
Motherfuckers can just wake up and relax
And smoke a fat blunt or some shit
Buy a fifth a Henn and get drunk (yes)
Hey, bring that over, call them up
Order me some motherfucking (Knoc-Turn' al) Hennesy

[Verse 1: Knoc]
Wu-Tang got mansions in the hills
Ho squat thick, ho squat paying bills
Red & Meth on hot wheels bumping down Sunset
La Maridia, sky balling, what is this?
My eyes, they caught up in the sea, look at Jay-Z
At the Source's Swap Meet getting Memphis Bleek some fitted khakis
Yeah, well real niggas get passes sometimes
Out of bounds in the land of the sunshine
Even Biggie said he was coming back (coming back)
And if he did, we would accept him because a nigga is black
You bleed just like us
Picture me being scared of a nigga that breathe the same air as me
You bleed just like us
Was a song I did, bumped on blocks and beaches with beat in my trunk

[Chorus: S-Dog, Knoc]
[S-Dog] Night and day
[Knoc] Where 80 percent of the population gang bangs
Most of y'all hate but I know y'all got to love
[S-Dog] LA!
[Knoc] Yeah
[S-Dog] Night and day
Welcome players we'll gangster step
[Knoc] Some of y'all hate but I know y'all got to love
[S-Dog] LA!
Night and day
[Knoc] Sraight up (what?)
[S-Dog] Welcome players we'll gangster step

[Verse 2: Knoc]
You can catch LL on Venice Beach on Sundays catching sun rays
I is playing this little game
Like watching ass sway back and forth (what up, girl?)
Macking the most, stripes on my coat, a bragging boast (West Coast!)
Jennifer Lopez and Puffy at Miyagi's eating sushi
Now, tell me what else does your eyes see
A lot of other Coast niggas pass through frequently and it's cool
Because y'all pay dues and I pay them too

[Chorus: S-Dog, Knoc]
[Knoc] Some of y'all hate but I know y'all got to love
[S-Dog] LA!
[Knoc] Yeah
[S-Dog] Night and day
[Knoc] Turn it up
[S-Dog] Welcome players we'll gangster step
[Knoc] Some of y'all hate but I know y'all got to love
[S-Dog] LA!
[Knoc] We in the land of the sunshine where bitches have good times
Palm trees and sea breezes
And I'm out to find a fly fine girl so I can try out my new mack lines

[Verse 3: Knoc]
You seen The Lox? (yes), Ludacris? (no)
Too $hort? (yes), that's my dog (so)
I did a rap with him to increase my (dough)
Was he dope? (yes)
Is he fake? (no)
Weak game? (banging), hop ('64's)
Four or five deep with three or four (hoes)

[Chorus: S-Dog, Knoc]
[S-Dog] Night and day
[Knoc] Where 80 percent of the population gang bangs
Some of y'all hate but I know y'all got to love
[S-Dog] LA!
Night and day
[Knoc] Straight up
[S-Dog] Welcome players we'll gangster step
[Knoc] Most of y'all hate but I know y'all got to love
[S-Dog] LA!
[Knoc] In the land of the sunshine where bitches have good times
Palm trees and sea breezes
And I'm out to find a fly fine girl so I can try out my new mack lines

[Outro: Knoc]
Yeah, fly is the weather - I feel the breeze
L.A.C. night and day
Inner city living with inner city game
Casuas fat laces on some new Chuck's (yes)
I got my running shoes on
Gangstered out from head to toe (head to toe)
Fucking hoes and patroling the hood
Heat on my lap looking for a light
Because, uh, I just rolled up a chronic sack
That's some, that's some good shit[Time Bomb]
I'm from the S-O-U-T-H side of C-A, why they try to P-H
Still hit 'em up with that E-A, G-A to the N-G-S-T-A
So fuck them other N-I double-G A's
Hate the po-po's and kill the DA
Hang with my crew, blue strings in my shoes
Mary jane and some loot, while we swangs in the coupe
I'm addicted to mackin' hoes - tracks and flows
Crenshaw Boulevard back and forth
L.A.'s finest, and L.A.'s behind us
Gangstaz, hoochies, essays, and hunnies
D's still twistin', low-low's still hoppin'
Gangsta shit still droppin', Crenshaw still poppin'
Gang signs throwin' up, bodies still showin' up
And oh yea - Time Bomb still blowin' up, beotch  (L.A.C.)

(When you got a L.A. Confidential, up in the place to be
Ride, ride with me - )

[Chorus: Butch Cassidy]
Let's all roll, throw it up if you're with me
I'm so cold, who am I but stayin' G
Tha Dogg Pound spreads the word, I know y'all heard
Please take heed when I speak or you'll get served

[Slip Capone]
You know the gangstaz hang, gangstaz bang
And gangstaz slang, it's just a gangsta thang
Cause gangstaz dip and some gangstaz trip
I'm the gangsta Slip and this Gangsta Crip
I used to bump Brotha Lynch and Ganksta Nip
Cause wasn't nobody else up on that gangsta tip
Gangstaz smoke sherm and gangstaz rock perms
Gangstaz don't listen and gangstaz don't learn
Gangstaz rock braids and gangsta jheri curls
Gangstaz gon' take over the world
Gangstaz go to jail but gangstaz skip bail
Gangstaz make mail, a gangsta won't ever fail
Gangstaz - gon' stay on top
Because a gangsta gon' make the gangsta shit pop
Just lounge homeboy, you in the gangsta zone
Hawthorne, California where the gangstaz roll

[Chorus: Butch Cassidy]
Let's all roll, throw it up if you're with me
I'm so cold, who am I but stayin' G
Tha Dogg Pound spreads the word, I know y'all heard
Please take heed when I speak or you'll get served

[Jayo Felony]
My nigga Slip is a gangsta
But cuhz, I'm a hoodsta or hood star
And I'm takin' the hood far
Little C-riders posted up with the bullet loco blue rags
Smokin' the bomb and fluid and keep dumpin' on you fags
I heard and seen it all, I'm hopin' I ball
Keep on lickin' them loco nuts until I get Crip balls
I'm still strivin', yea, you worried about what I'm drivin'?
Your bitch needs to give me more pedal to the floor
Fuck a Navigator, nigga I can flip ten gators in my living room
If you can't do that, nigga give me room
Had a ???? '89, but see your bitch made me mines
See them motherfuckin' rims on that brand new Benz? bitch they be mine
For mine I did the crime, had to run from one-time
And you bet I can't fit my dick all in your mouth at one time
I fuck your mammi in the butt and Crip Walk on your liver
While I'm rich rollin' on a river, bitch

[Knoc-Turn'al]
Caught up in a land of hard times, back off mine
Mash while pushin' a hard line
A hard cat, with hard raps and hard rhymes
I hardly pay attention to rats
But my mind says hard dick served to a bitch ain't no crime
Cook soft dope to hard dimes
Chicken - by the way I flip mine
I hard hit and grip like canines
I target hard heads with no spine
March in and start to take mine
Big D let me fuck that bitch and you fuck mine
Off hard liqour it's hard to unwind
Knoc-turn'al comes through in overtime
When I die build me a shrine
I'm as - hard as hard can get
In my mind I ain't begun to spit yet, and until that time -

[Butch Cassidy]
Let's throw it up, throw it up , let 'em know
Out in the West, represent, let it go
Let's throw it up, throw it up , let 'em know
Out in the West, represent, let it go

(L-L-A.C.)[Knoc-Turn'Al]
West Coast! (12x)
If you with it, then I'm with it
We can do it in a minute
Open up and let me hit it
Big hips I'm workin with it

Born and raised, that's why I love LA

Got my life then I'ma live it
Need some money, I'ma get it
Shoot first then get a grip
That's about how Cali live it
Lookin for a super chicken

Her man don't even know she missin everyday
Chrome 100 spoke spinnin, Glocks spittin, Hennesy sippin
Wanna party I ain't trippin
64 hittin, stay representin
I was

Born and raised, that's why I love LA

[Knoc-Turn'Al - Chorus]
I'm gone keep dippin, yeah
I'm gone keep switchin lanes, uh huh
I'm gone keep ridin, yeah
You know there ain't a damn thing changed
You pop lock, we pop Glocks
I just came to have some fun and get drunk in the club I came to party
Born and raised, that's why I love LA

[Knoc-Turn'Al]
Cadillac 4 do with a ho named Po Ko
Spit flame, got the rap game in a choke hold
Hoppin lo lo's on dayton danes in mo mo's

Born and raised, that's why I love LA

Ain't no place like home
I hate being on promo
I don't like dressin and I don't smoke hydro
Yeah, I got kush and I roll with a fo fo
Bulletproof vest and a kilo of do do
Minglin, dippin and dabbin
I don't care if that's yo bitch I'm still stabbin
You pulled heat and don't pop I'm laughin

Born and raised, that's why I love LA

[Knoc-Turn'Al - Chorus (2x)]
I'm gone keep dippin, yeah
I'm gone keep switchin lanes, uh huh

Born and raised, that's why I love LA

[Knoc-Turn'Al]
Yeah, uh
Born and raised, that's why I love LA[Knoc-Turn'Al & DJ Quik (Talking)]
K: What up Quik?
D: 'Ey Knoc
K: What up?
D: I'm just trippin' off of how you sound to this beat, man!
It's like, it's that kinda shit that make niggas in the street be like
Damn! And the bitches like -

[Knoc-Turn'Al]
I'm just lookin' to have a good time and find some ass to grab
A nice bush to stab and hit, minus the bullshit, minus the two bit
Up her knowin' I'm ruthless and need of a good bitch
So independent, more than my mistress, more than to fuck
She comes, reopen the guest list
My bunny rabbit, most men want but can't have it
I'ma tap it, and get pornographic, it's automatic
She turns heads, everywhere she goes
Men that's young and old
And bisexuals, would like to go low
And deliver low blows and high off sex and no do's

[Chorus]
I just need me a little good lovin'
Sex she wants but she wasn't my cousin
Sexually, she can be, so misleadin'
Secretly, between the sheets, and she's leadin'
My love slave (love slave)
Love slave (love slave)
Pretty skin, high yellow, dressed in all black leather

[Knoc-Turn'Al]
Up in the place, doin' the thing, amazing grace
Amazingly shakes ass and cakes
Dressed in drape and all lace, breakin' me off
Breakin' it down, breakin' a sweat, touchin' the ground
Up at the lounge, up at the club, and up at the spot
Up in the bathroom, living room, or out on the block
I won't stop, I won't quit, drinkin' a 5th
Bangin' some new shit from Dre & DJ Quik
Shakin' the miss fist & miss hit, call up the smile and fake tits
Hollywood and fakeness, good and greatness
Everything, a difference is, the difference is
In this bitch is, she ridin' dick
Up this place to be, playin' the game
Makin' the dame, ignorin' the fame, ignorin' the things
That make a dream and stressed out, simply plain
I maintain a main gain of material things

[Chorus]

[Knoc-Turn'Al]
Thinkin' bout goin' home, freakin' the ho
Bringin' the drink, bringin' some dank and get on the floor
I'ma, rock it right and separate the men from mice
Live yo' life, fuck the limelight rap hype
Lookin' to have a good time by midnight
And get mines off and chill with a few dykes
Ready and willin', sorority pledgin'
Lessen them and breast be puttin' work in
Her man won't know when she craves what she do
When she ain't up in the club and she up in my room
I seen some guy for less, die for nothin'
Then seen some rest in peace over fuckin'
Stay in the place to be, doin' the same thing
Maintain my good game and things won't change
Niggas is some timey, salty as one grain
I stay a G, and handle mine, stay out to get paid

[Chorus][Samuel Christian]
You ready?

[Knoc-Turn'al]
Yes, ha ha ha
Yeah, yeah
Let's go, I like singing

[Knoc-Turn'al]
My music, my life, my heart, my soul
My music, my everything, I give my all
My wife, my daughter, my love, my dream
My mother, my father, my brother, my team
My camp, my squad, my house, my car
My boat, my shoes, my pants, my shirt
My coke, my sugar, my cream, my butter
My toast, my all, my queen, my folks

[Hook: Samuel Christian]
My baby! Walk like six strings
Talk like she's my everything
My baby! Loves me, hates me
Leaves me, runs right back
That sexy lady! All I know
She shares all my confusion, so
My baby! Will not run from an-y-thing
I swear this though

[Knoc-Turn'al talking]
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If Muzik should die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take

[Knoc-Turn'al]
She's thick, she's bad, so clean, she's fine
She loves, she hates, she laughs, she cries
She hurts, she lies, she's Bonnie, I'm Clyde
She's ghetto, she's real, she sings, she rhymes
She comes, she goes, she lives, she dies
She sexy and bomb, she blows my mind
She stays in line, she's smart, she's funny
She's crafty and cunning, in the game she's running
Her lips, her back, her waist, her thighs
Her face, her skin, her hair, her eyes
Her voice, her shape, her hips, her mind
Her love, her smile, her touch, her time

[Hook]

[Knoc-Turn'al]
I'm tipsy, I'm through, I'm drunk, I'm blunted
My way, my day, my life - I love it
I move, I groove, I shake, I love it
My friends, my kins, I like, I love it
I show, I prove, I live, I learn
I show, I teach, I run these streets
My kin, my heart, my heat, my rhythm
My rap, my beat, my life, my head and my feet
My heart, my soul, my candy, my cake
My platinum, my gold, my land, my gate
My Benz, my lake
My keys, my money, my love, my hate
My clothes, my phone, my house, my home
My money, my comb, my sugar, my spice
My base, my chrome
My rhythm, my music, my home
My world, my girl, my life, my home, my...

[Hook] - repeat until fade[Knoc-Turn'al talking]
Yeah
It's how we do
This a little story about uh..
A nigga you know well, Knoc-Turn'al

[Hook]
I can see you watching
Waitin in my garden
In my bushes plottin
Peepin' Tom's in my home
Lookin in my window

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time in the projects, yo
There lived a nigga named Knoc-Turn'al
America's most wanted, for sho'
In a black Lo-Lo, with tinted windows
Just cruisin' down the street in my 6-4
Checking all my traps and all my hoes
Life is, too short, I stay on my toes
G'd up, I spill gin and juice on brand new clothes
I pulled up, hit a switch and dropped the back
On the prowl in a black hat lookin for cats
I got a chrome plaque that reads, "Who's the Mac?!"
Black pussy, always talk about it cause I love it
This California love got a nigga drunk in public
Express yo' self, keep doin' it good
Got white on the block, keep the heat in the bush
Keep risin' to the top, keep smokin' the kush
The boys in the hood are always hard
Come talkin that trash, we'll pull your guard
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Can't trust my homies, can't trust no bitch
Don't quote me boy, cause I ain't say shit
It's hotter on the block than it is in the kitchen
And I'm hard in the paint, listen, I'm steady dippin
I get down, while your bullshittin'
And these are the tales, the freaky tales
Of a nigga on the grind that you know so well
Got a system in your trunk then I'm jacking for beats
Black superman, I put it down for L.A.C
I grip the pump in my lap at all times
Fools be jackin' other fools but they don't be jackin mine
Summer time in the L.B.C. (Fuck the police)
Fuck being bound by law and the peace treaty
We be clubbin, everybody likes when the girls shake somethin
System overload, stay bumpin
It's thug life, y'all know the rules, gotta do what ya gotta do, and stay true
Propose a toast to the West Coast
Easily I approach the microphone because I ain't no joke
Tell your mama to get off of my dip
I have no time to give her my dick, I'm gonna hold it
And walk around the stage
And if you fuck up, I'm gonna get my gauge and shrivel you up
Like California raisins, then unload the barrell and laugh
Cause I'm puttin lead in your motherfuckin' ass

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm on the radio, and ain't a damn thing funny
It's just like Compton, bitch better have my money
I messed up and I don't know why
Tryin' to get a piece of that American Pie
Do my thing, blow off the roof on 187-Proof
It's gettin funk-ay, it's gettin funk-ay
It's the formula, murder was the case that they gave me
Dear God, I wonder can you save me?
Dear Mama, Brenda had a baby
Hard times got a nigga goin' crazy
The hood can't take me under, it's a G-thang
We backyard bullyin' in the land where we bang
Gangsta's make the world go 'round
What's my motherfuckin' name?
Knoc-Turn'al, didn't even have to use my AK
Today was a good day[Chorus]
We all know I love the westcoast
I'm sorry that I left you babe
Even tho I stayed on the go
I really really missed you babe

We all know I love the westcoast
I'm sorry that I left you babe
Even tho I stayed on the go
I still represent the westcoast babe

[Knoc-Turn'al]
OK ill admit, I got lazy
Cause I ain't like these other suckers dre paid me
The reason why you know my name is dre made me
I got a fly ass house, Man that shits crazy
I got a fly ass wife, life and two babies
And if the price is right a label will pay me
Turn down the lights tonight the mic can't tame me
Oh and it feels good to be back at home
Kicking ass and taking names I'm never alone
Taking out the trash leave some radio space
How you do what you do doc, I don't know its gods grace
He made me leave mcs to pick up they face
I like to live summer breeze in summer breezes place
I like a bitch to shop and hustle dressed in all ace
I came back to straighten it out it's Knoc-Turn'al
And this is what I do

[Chorus]

[Knoc-Turn'al]
I gave the west a bad name, I'm here to back clean up
When I say don't be playing don't be playing with these nuts
And if I ever gave you something nigga then re up
And if I ain't never gave you nothing then so what
Help me help you get something and man up
Who you talking slick to fronting outlandishly
We go to war who gonna outlast this beast
Oh and it feels good to be back at home
Get them gangsta in your home girls on the phone
Hustlers and the pimps Knoc-Turn'als back home
All that really matters is whos hosting your spatter
Everyone I meet they give me a pussy platter
I walk by she latches on, I don't have to grab her
And you in the club acting just like jack the ripper
Don't control your ho just tip her
Oh and it feels good to be back at home

[Chorus]

[Knoc-Turn'al]
I love the way
I love the way
I love the way
I love the way that you love my music and all I know
I've been riding for way to long, been riding for way to long
They say my voice raspy, I've been hitting the bong
And I can never quite pass up a bitch in a thong
I could do this all night long a 5th of hennessy a oz
I won't go home I feel good my bank roll is fat
Matter fact where the party at?
I'm og's hulk hogan at a wrestling match
I've been here my 1st car was a 72 lack
I came from a long generation of true macs
If you grew up in the hood you could feel this
And if you got up out of the hood and you hood rich so I
Do what I got to do

[Chorus][Knoc-turn'al]
Super ugly!

[Xzibit]
Mr X to tha Z

[Knoc-turn'al]
Yeah, Warren (aaahaaa aaaahaaa)
LA indo
Gangster and mack mo
Bullets at your window (dangerous)

[Xzibit]
Ruthless, hostile, unforgiven
Who gave you permission to try to stop me from livin huh?
Try again faggot
You've gotta ride better than that
To move out in front of the pack
It's two thousand and two
My backpack raps got my backpack strapped and filled with plaques
I ain't relaxed or laid back at home with my feet up
I drop Pradda, lock and load, heat the streets up
You weak fuck
Shakin and dancing
Ya'll takin pills, we takin penitentiary chances
I'm too advanced-is
Never the same when I hit it and quit it
You want it come get it, I'm wit it
When I say that I'm wit it
That means I got a main defense team that's gon get me acquitted
G's is walkin out the courtroom like George Jefferson
Stop the interviewin, the faggot had it comin to him

[Knoc-turn'al]
Warren G!

[Warren G]
What ya'll thought, I wasn't gonna return with a hit
Too much smokin that Sherman shit
I learnt this from the best that got ya'll sprung (what)
The-the doctor Andre Young
Compton, LB, ain't nothing y'all can tell me
Goin hard on the yard till my dogs bail me
They tells me I can't proceed wit it
I came back and got Warren G wit it

[Nate Dogg]
West coast
Still smoking on that indo
Smoke, oh no don't pretend oh no
I woulda came but I was dead break, no mo
I'm rollin on some real oh no
Bout to get it, but niggas trip though
Let's go
I'm the realest and they all know
Real dope
You need a filter or you will choke
Indo
That's all a nigga will smoke
Oh no

[Shade Sheist]
Now, niggas better get between their door (door)
I'm shakin all your shit onto the floor
And niggas don't get it
But be careful what you ask for you just might get it
Yo the undisputed middle weight champ runnin like Hopkins
Clap six to ya shins niggas start hoppin (Sheist never stoppin)
In other words, if your click full
Can't press mute and it don't apply now
I'm feelin funny in the tummy and a nigga ain't been eatin for weeks (I'm sick)
I ain't trying to get no better
But rather
Infect the world leavin Vicks in an old sweater

[Knoc-turn'al]
Knoc's landin
Tell me if it ain't me, who got the best plannin (yup)
Who got your ears tuned it and who keeps you listenin
Who gots your undivided attention
Who makes your panties wet girl (what)
Hold up, pause
Which nigga on TV that you see makes you wanna give up the draws
At parties and shows, I mash regardless
Yo hardest flows couldn't stop this bombardment
I clench the vision till there's no room for expansion
All prepared for war it's Knoc's landin
A nightly stalker, in shadows I walk
Mindin my own while haters throw soft
The more I succeed, the more bitches clock
Through my peripheral vision I watch subconsciously
Waitin to introduce you to tragedy see
Knoc's landin

[Nate Dogg]
West coast
