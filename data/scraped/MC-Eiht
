[Bridge]
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street I hear

[ScHoolBoy Q]
"YAWK! YAWK! YAWK! YAWK!"

[Hook]
"Man down, where you from, nigga?"
"Fuck who you know, where you from, my nigga?"
"Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?"
"This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga"

[Verse 1]
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slinging crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighing on your brain
It was Me, L Boogs and Yan Yan, YG, Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, waving your hand out the window, check yourself, uh
Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder saying that he did it
But ever since that day, I was looking at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time, with the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shooting for if you ain't walking up, you fucking punk?
Picking up the fucking pump, picking off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch, a wall of bullets coming from
AK's, AR's, "Aye y'all, duck"
That's what momma said when we was eating the free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck your truce
Now crawl your head in that noose, you wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just pieces BG's up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IV's on top of IV's
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your colors correct
Make sure you're corporate, or they'll be calling your mother collect
They say the governor collect, all of our taxes except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You moving backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a Tec
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess, m.A.A.d city

[Hook + Bridge]

[Part 2]

[Intro: MC Eiht]
Wake your punk ass up! It ain't nothing but a Compton thang, G-yeah. Real simple and plain, I'mma teach you some lessons about the street. It ain't nothing but a Compton thang, G-yeah. How we do

[Verse 2]
Fresh outta school cause I was a high school grad
Sleeping in the living room in my momma's pad
Reality struck I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My pops said I needed a job I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leaving
In fact I got fired cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foaming at the mouth
I was straight tweaking the next weekend, we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleeding
You know the reasons but still won't ever know my life
Kendrick A.K.A. Compton's human sacrifice

[Interlude: MC Eiht]
G-yeah, cocaine, weed. Niggas been mixing shit since the 80's, loc. Sherm sticks, butt nakeds. Dip, make a nigga flip. Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit. One time's crooked and shit. Block a nigga in. Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton

[Verse 3: MC Eiht]
I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah, that's cool
The hood took me under so I follow the rules
But yeah that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doing the same thing
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-by's in the hood lately
Couple of I.V.s with the fucking spraycan
Shots in the crowd then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip
Trip, we in the hood still
So loc, grab a strap cause yeah, it's so real
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and 10 grands where a mothafucka stand

[Verse 4]
If I told you I killed a nigga at 16, would you believe me?
Or see me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of being a lawyer or doctor, instead of boy with a chopper
That hold the cul-de-sac hostage, kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizing
The option of living a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinking and drive, hit the powder then watch this flame
That arrive in his eye, listen coward, the concept is aim
And they bang it and slide out that bitch with deposits
A price on his head, the tithes probably go to the projects
I live inside the belly of the rough
Compton, U.S.A. made Me an Angel on Angel Dust, what

[Skit]
– Nigga, pass Dot the bottle, damn! You ain't the one that got fucked up, what you holding it for? Niggas always acting unsensitive and shit
– Nigga, that ain't no word
– Nigga, Shut up! Hey, Dot, you good, my nigga? Don't even trip, just lay back and drink that[Intro]
Wake your punk ass up for the 93 shot
MC Eiht's in the motherfuckin house.. gyeah
And it ain't nothin but a compton thang y'all
And we ain't nuttin but niggas on the run
And this goes out to my niggas.. gyeah

[Verse 1]
A fucked up childhood, is why the way I am
It's got me in the state where I don't give a damn, hmm
Somebody help me, but nah they don't hear me though
I guess I'll be another victim of the ghetto
Ain't no escapin, cause I'm way too young
Pops is dealin, and on top of that got moms sprung
Scheamin off the top, pops never figured
That he'd go down by the hands of another nigga
Now my pops is gone and that ain't no good
Got to follow in the foot steps of the homies from the hood
And where's the role model?
Niggas putting brew in my fuckin baby bottle!
Damn, and through all the motherfuckin pain
They done drove my moms in-sane
So I guess I gotta do work so I ain't finished
I grow up to be a streiht up menace, gyeah

[Hook]
Uhh, come on y'all
Streiht up menace

[Verse 2]
Now I'm of age, and livin in the projects
Gettin paid off the clucks and the county checks
I'm Fil-ia fresh outta high school, never did I wonder
That the motherfuckin hood would take me under
Gyeah, I'm kickin it with the homies and they got the straps
Off to the corner store, owned by the fuckin {Japs}
See a bitch in the right lane so I comes with the mack
Astro Bam pulls a motherfuckin jack from the back
Now he's got the strap to my homie's head
See him play that shit cool, and don't be a fool!
He shot my nigga in the fuckin head
I caught one in the shoulder, if I didn't run I was dead
Now I'm layin in the hospital bed
Thinkin about them punk motherfuckers and my eyes is bloodshot red
Gyeah motherfuckers, I ain't finished
Be on the look-out for the streiht up menace, gyeah

[Bridge]
Uhh, whassup y'all
Streiht up menace .. damn!
Really..
Streiht up menace .. damn!

[Verse 3]
I'm in too deep
I done killed a motherfucker and I just can't sleep
One-Time's tryin to do a smooth, creep
And on top of that
Niggas after me for fuckin one of they hood rats
I ain't got time for the fuckin bitch's story
Niggas want me gotta come to my territory
And ain't no 'You Can Get the Fist'
Niggas come, and they get done on they own risk
What is it all about?
Should I leave or should I stay cause I don't wanna punk out
Oh what should I do? The homies say
'The hood's where it's good, homeboy, I thought you knew'
So in the process to show the hood my best
No time to react, caught two in the chest
Now look who's down, I guess I'm finished
I go out like a streiht up menace, gyeah

[Hook]

[Outro]
And on and on
I guess we outta here
Peace to my niggas on the run
And it ain't nuttin but streiht up menaces, damn!
Just like I said before y'all
It ain't nuttin but a compton thang
And MC Eiht's in the house for the 93 shot
And this one's for the niggas, gyeah[Verse 1: MC Eiht]
Welcome to Los Santos
Gyeah
Where it's easy to catch a case
One times patrol with a pic of ya face
Fo' deep in the Lac, that's jack mode
Unaware of the set-neutral dress code
Drive-bys tryna pull grand theft
Bandanas on the antennas, neighborhood deaf
Rats fucking niggas for ends, bitch please
Easily friends turn into enemies
Tryna check a couple dollars but it ain't long
Jealousy in shots if the weight wrong
Stay strong, die well
Growing up in the hood's no fairytale
It's Mad City and can't y'all tell
Welcome to the city where it's dead or jail
Steady eating good, we pull licks
Staying deep like OGs in jail pics
Gyeah, welcome to the land
Welcome to the land
Welcome to the land
Straps, a couple birds in ya hand
Gyeah

[Hook]
Welcome to Los Santos
Welcome to Los Santos
Welcome to Los Santos
Welcome to Los Santos

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Yea, where it's easy to get some weight
Hop in the stolen whip and I'll take you straight to the place
That grand theft and robbery mask draped on my face
A cold bastard, closed casket seal my fate
For this almighty dollar dollar
When we dealing what we do you know we do it proper
And all these doctors and psychiatrists can't save me, I'm crazy
Everyday these Los Santos streets gon' pay me
It feel good don't it?
Kush smoke and west coastin' on every hood corner
I drop the top at the beach
Heard it's fun in paradise, yo that's the word on the street
Don't let these palm trees and bitches get you swept off yo feet
I'm staying blazed in these sun rays
Evil seeds getting paid, cradle to the grave
You can try it if you want, it ain't a thing sweet
The weather's fine but it's cold on these rough ass streets of Los Santos
Welcome to the land
Welcome to the land
Put a bird in ya hand
Welcome to Los Santos

[Verse 3: Kokane]
Don't get fooled by the palm trees
Fly ass bitches and bomb ass weed
It's real over here on these cold streets
Triple OGs stay about that cheese

Yo we want everybody out there to throw their hands up...
...so get it on kid!

Verse One: Erick Sermon

Fresh is the word, when I display my rappin forte
Quicker done than O.J., hey
I freaks my shit, E the lyrical master
Stress me out, no doubt, I might have to blast ya
Let me ask ya, can I gets busy one time?
And unwind and chill, with Cypress Hill
Huh, I go on with my bad self
I'm the four pound toter, the Phil blunt smoker
Believe me not, I'm wicked like three sixes
I'm doper than the Pete Rock remixes
Never walk through the crowd sluggish
I'm hardcore to the Bone, I'm Thuggish Ruggish
The Green-Eyed, Bandit, I be ERRRICK SERRRMON
I gets real determined
And one for the trouble, and two for the bass
I take it to your face with this here lyrical mace
And if you don't know, y'all better recognize
I'm coming through with speed, with pounds of weed

Verse Two: B-Real

Ahh shit, another one of those gangsta hits
Niggas wanna get busy with the ultimate
Fools get real, yo I'm representin the Hill
With chips and clips and tons of blue steel
So who wants to be the first nigga to die?
Then try and test this, buddha blessed Gemini
You get thrown sent home in a coffin
Punk stuff don't make it back, very often
I got Erick to take care of the Sermon
Ashes to ashes, dust, bodies burnin
Bustin open the doors to the temple
Takin you to the dark side of your mental

Chorus: B-Real

Kickin it to the brothers on the corners, in the alleys
Throw your hands in the air
Kickin it to the brothers on the corners, in the alleys
Throw your hands in the air

Chorus

Verse Three: Redman

I rhyme tricky, the sticky smoka with the mind itchy
Finger up on the pen, be like "He the bomb, dicky!"
These off-keys MC's hawk me, they won't get off me
So I kill em softly and use em as walkie talkies *bzzzzt*
Turn up my level adjust my voice pitch
Hoist this diagnosis, comatosis
Is what I leave your crew with, boom bip or some two and two shit
Raw silk, cuz YOU DO IT TO MY MUSIC
*Funk Doctor Spock* lock the hypest
Individual, to put criminal in diapers
With my nigga E and Cypress, what I write bitch
You swore, it was a nuclear war, crisis
In your back yard, word to God, Def Squad!
With my nigga Keith in the place takin charge
Word up you'll get hurt up like the jury callin murder
You're deaf cuz I freak shit you neva heard of

Chorus

Verse Four: MC Eiht

Steppin to the park in the Hill you can't hang
The original baby gangsta on this Compton thang
Don't slip, the late night hype, is when I dip
Boo-yaa is the sound from a lonely clip
Can't feel me, if I was crack you'd try to steal me
Heard you, and your little crew, wanna peel me
Keep your hands on your hood, you get got
The Green-Eyed Bandit, Cypress Hill, and the Funk Doctor Spock
You wish you could hang, like I hang
Dwells in the C-P-T, the hood thing
G, the trigga finger, I'mma get you
Hit you, the Tech 9, I'mma split you
Ain't no poppin, no stoppin
Tick to the tock, tick tock I hit your block
Throw your hands in the air, don't bite this
I squeeze, nigga please, the E down with Cypress

And that equals the nine you know I'msayin?One more nigga on the run
I just can't handle this, born in the land of the scandalous
Thirteen years of age at the time
Moms ain't kickin' in, I gots to get mine
I load up my strap, map out my plan
Choose my victim, then motherfuckin' stick him
One more point that got scored for the hood
Up to no damn good, understood
Steps is getting low so I gots to get some more
Loads up the K, break out the back door
You know the routine, so punk fool, here we go
Same bat channel, keep your motherfucking hands up on the dash
And gives up the cash
One times is making a move on my ass
But I ain't sweating it because ain't shit funny
Because it's all for the money

I gots to get mine, so I'm a take yours (Repeat 2x)

Just call me the come up kid
Hard times kicking it in the CPT
So that means I gotta do what I gotta do
And if you ain't down with the Hype, fuck you
You're coming up short when I slang
So when I hit your corner, you're gonna be a goner
Nigga duck when my nine starts to buck
In it for the snaps so I'm crazy as fuck
I should be laying low cause one time is real hot
Need to make a knot so I rush your spot
And it's like that when I got the feelin'
If you don't kill someone else does the killing
So when you hit the end of the road ain't no turning back
I done signed a hood lifetime contract
Jacking and packing cause ain't shit funny
Because it's all for the money

I gots to get mine, so I'm a take yours (Repeat 2x)

Uh oh, there goes another beep on the beeper
One time sleep on the fucking night creeper
Trying to show stop on the sales
Pull fake braids but I still gets paid
Just say no? Fuck the TV
Trying to push the shit cause the weight is exceed
See me for the blast, Five-oh fly in fast
Mad cause I'm making more cash than they ass
Now I lay low in the cut
Label me the nigga with the fucking gangsta strut
Every hooptie got gold license plates
My birds fly out throughout the fucking states
Now my other half is telling me I'd better quit
But I ain't through in this shit, so I guess this is it
I'll be dead before I go out like a dummy
(Why's that, G?) Cause it's all for the money

I gots to get mine, so I'm a take yours (Repeat 6x)Artist: Spice-1 f/ MC Eiht

Kill em all (4X)
Don't kick up in the dirt when I'm puttin in work
Kill em all (4X)
Cause everybody dyin on this motherfuckin album

[Spice 1]

I murda like this (this) I murda like that (that)
Pull an AK-47 up out my motherfuckin gangsta hat
Professional Columbian Necktie, barbwire
Strangler, over killa, dead fuckin body hanga
Peepin out the window with an A.K., pullin up on these copper
Helicoptas, squad cars, swat teams with choppers
They tellin me, "Nigga, get the fuck out before ya die
If you surrender, we'll make sure that you quickly fry"
Should I kick open the door and go to war
Or should I slit my throat
Leave a pipe bomb and a fuck you note
Hallucinations of seein lynched bodies burnin
And all the po-po had faces like Mark Fuhrman
Tear gas through my glass window pane
They wanna put me back up in the nut house again
But I'm not goin back and take my prozac
They can keep the straight jacket
And leave a straight motherfuckin jack
A straight motherfuckin jack
A straight motherfuckin jack

Chorus

(Get the hell off my dick, I'm 1990-sick)
(1990-sick) *repeat 4X*

[Spice 1]
Nigga's to pull the lynch, yayo case and stick
Marcia Clark screamin out murda, jumpin on OJ's dick
Motherfuckers still sufferin and healin
Some high tech knowledga white boys blew up the fuckin fed buildin
Crazy niggas still bangin and slangin crack
To the death, when the game put em up on they back
Motherfuckers catchin AIDS, from shootin hop
And phony niggas still get sprayed up on the block
And I ain't changed much, hell
I'm still smokin four or five motherfuckin choppers before it's twelve
Motherfuckers think they know me, but they don't know
I'm sellin first class tickets to the murda show
Don't wanna rap about no nigga, let's get it on
Bustin domes, buck shots through your rib bone
So all you niggas up in the magazines talkin shit
Get off my dick, I'm 1990-sick

Chorus

[MC Eiht]
1990-sick, I grasp my dick
The lunatic quick to grab my tech
Put slugs up in your neck
Compton is the city where I come from
Desert Eagle packin dum ditty ditty dum
I won't just smoke you
I be terrifyin horrifyin gyeah I'mma choke you
The killa niggas on hop
We tear up your spot, Eiht, Spice, and my fuckin nigga Pac
Don't cross my path, no class
I be like shit in your motherfuckin ass
Bullets I spit at you, your hood I slid through
Evil niggas tryin to get rid of you
No witnesses so don't ask no questions
Flee the scene, one-time'll be arrestin
Killa niggas don't play that
It's Compton on no like your dome we stompin
But in that gang affiliation
Shit goes pop, we won't stop
Uhhh, in 1990-sick

Chorus: repeat 2X

(Get the hell off my dick, I'm 1990-sick)
(1990-sick) *repeat 4X*One more nigga on the run
I just can't handle this, born in the land of the scandalous
Thirteen years of age at the time
Moms ain't kickin' in, I gots to get mine
I load up my strap, map out my plan
Choose my victim, then motherfuckin' stick him
One more point that got scored for the hood
Up to no damn good, understood
Steps is getting low so I gots to get some more
Loads up the K, break out the back door
You know the routine, so punk fool, here we go
Same bat channel, keep your motherfucking hands up on the dash
And gives up the cash
One times is making a move on my ass
But I ain't sweating it because ain't shit funny
Because it's all for the money

I gots to get mine, so I'm a take yours (Repeat 2x)

Just call me the come up kid
Hard times kicking it in the CPT
So that means I gotta do what I gotta do
And if you ain't down with the Hype, fuck you
You're coming up short when I slang
So when I hit your corner, you're gonna be a goner
Nigga duck when my nine starts to buck
In it for the snaps so I'm crazy as fuck
I should be laying low cause one time is real hot
Need to make a knot so I rush your spot
And it's like that when I got the feelin'
If you don't kill someone else does the killing
So when you hit the end of the road ain't no turning back
I done signed a hood lifetime contract
Jacking and packing cause ain't shit funny
Because it's all for the money

I gots to get mine, so I'm a take yours (Repeat 2x)

Uh oh, there goes another beep on the beeper
One time sleep on the fucking night creeper
Trying to show stop on the sales
Pull fake braids but I still gets paid
Just say no? Fuck the TV
Trying to push the shit cause the weight is exceed
See me for the blast, Five-oh fly in fast
Mad cause I'm making more cash than they ass
Now I lay low in the cut
Label me the nigga with the fucking gangsta strut
Every hooptie got gold license plates
My birds fly out throughout the fucking states
Now my other half is telling me I'd better quit
But I ain't through in this shit, so I guess this is it
I'll be dead before I go out like a dummy
(Why's that, G?) Cause it's all for the money

I gots to get mine, so I'm a take yours (Repeat 6x)(Intro)
Geah
Hoo-Bangin in the house c'mon
Geah
Eihthype in the house c'mon

Real Compton City G's on this one
My nigga [??] in the house
We gon set it off like this

(Verse 1)
Y'all niggas wanna toss on me
Throw sum
Get ready for the hot one here it come
Y'all scream like bitches scheme my riches
Too suspicious my Glock rocks to your jaw
Nigga just too vicious land of the lost
Who's the boss get tossed have you seen her
My Nina, she's catchin a misdemeanor
My rep gets bigger my finger on the trigger
I cocks the hammer back like 'fucks you nigga!'
I let loose shells fly like the [?spruise-goose?]
Push weight protects mine, much juice
I hoo-bangs with a gang and slangs caine
Fuck what you tryin to get nigga, it's my thang!
[??] cops more white and hit claims
I serves everything from white to mary jane
I'm hittin the one times with a fake last thing
Just to keep my ass on the streets, in the game, it's automatic

(Chorus)
I represent the hoodrats and the B.G's
The niggas on the corner whop white to make cheese
If you want some then niggas bring static
It's automatic

(Verse 2)
You need to get at me, I'm the G
Locin and provokin dips blocks with cavi
Search a ki' cross the street and smash out
The '63 bounce back to the same route
You fools best get the fuck off my cold tales
Gang tales of how the fuckin dead body smells
Late night horror shows in jail cells
Represent where you from no one to tell
Life ain't nuthin but the hood and snaps
Hoodrats carry work with straps in they laps
Quarter niggas with nicknames play craps
Enemies tryin to cross the front line
Get capped nuthin but escape, uh
Second flat my gat let loose like 'Rat-a-tat-tat'
The underground hero guess y'all is back
My custom, my khaki suit and a blue cap, automatic

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
I make it difficult for a nigga to find me
Crazy-ass Hoo-Bangin G's behind me
You're fucked up for that last time fo' sho'
Now you know, two in your door, four to the floor
Any nigga wanna bring it-bring
I guarantee your ass will hear the Glock sing
Quick to hit out like [name] the street king
Shells ricochet up your body, ping ping
Eazy don't come to [??] pound
West to the chest
Is the best get-coast
On the contrary I shots down your post
You're gettin next to me, uh, too close
Close down your whole block froze down
Infiltrators end up-no sound
You sorry muthafuckas here's your showdown
Eiht caught a hot one now I'm county-bound, automatic

(Chorus)

(Outro)
Geah

Geah(Dresta)

We supposed to pick up my homeboy Eiht
I wan' try to hit him up right now to see what's happ'nin

(Verse 1 by Dresta)
I know you love it, the most rugged Mc's, out the Gate
It's Dresta with them drunkest Crooked I and the Eiht
Oh-Oh, 2 Compton niggas known for freakin 'em right
Man, Crooked late at night got 3 and they tight
In the Bourbon, swervin', do Irvine try'na catch Eiht
So we can hook him with the 3rd fine lady
Named Mercedes, got a body like a 'Maserati'
Thinkin to myself:'I must be crazy! Tryna give away this hottie!'
Now I glance at the passenger seat
Can't deny that this girl by my side was just too damn fly
Too Jeopardized, I just glanced at her eyes
And them caramel thighs make my main man rise
Can't wait to re-arrive at the 'tele
So I can lick them honey off that ring on her belly
For so', I glance in the mirror once mo'
Loc, I gotta catch Eiht cause I know he gon' love this ho

(Chorus)
Real G's get lonely
We can have fun but bring some for the homie
(Sweet Black Pussy)
I only fuck with real niggas only
We can have fun but bring some for the homie
(Sweet Black Pussy)

(Verse 2 by Mc Eiht)
I gives a damn how these hoes tryna floss these days
Cause they still gets the nuts, fucks tramps and sluts
I must have kill it, the way you want me, ride the pony
'Secrets' like Toni(Braxton), members only
Dresta, I heard they turn in tricks for bucks
2 tricks get the dicks hard, ready to suck
Don't be havin me in suspense, but in the meanwhile
I be dippin up in the LB with C-Style
Back to the CPT, home bud and Tanquerina
Beatin' up the pussy like Ike(Turner) beat up Tina(Turner)
You know me, the gangsta love'll never wine and dine
Keep it tight, anytime I fuck it like [name]
Lately the Hype, I know it ain't right
3 a.m. I ring your phone every night
Let's play house, no cat and mouse
Don't floant it, Eiht just give it how you want it
But in the end don't press your luck
Because ain't no bitch like the bitch I fucked!

(Chorus)

(Verse 3 by Crooked I)
Fuck the bullshit, the pimps at the pool pit
I know that you want chips but dick is all you get
I knock them skins out like always trained by custom auto
Never givin' a bitch shit, that's a hustlers motto
Except sumptin' to swallow
Now your boyfriend wanna follow
Hit a nigga with a hollow tip and fuck the bitch tomorrow
I can never be your simp, trick!
I'm slappin bitches with 9 inches, the limp dick
Plus a pimps dick
Dig short, small, diggin 'em large and tall
Y'all the bigger they are the harder they fall
I fuck 'em all!!
The ho-philosopher, broke, dope and popular
Still strokin' , now goin deeper than Ocean (??)
I got your 'bra, gettin ready for the pony ride
Doggy-style, so I can hit the backsiiiide
Grab the head pump that ass in the air
What did you know?
The ho hollered:'how ya do dat dere?!'

(Chorus)

...Sweet Black Pussy... -till the endGeah

All over that big fat tail
Making you come faster than the metro rail

Bend over to the side so I can hit the spot
Bitch throw your legs on top of my shoulder

Eight years ago a friend of mine
Asked me to say some gangsta rhymes
So I said this rhyme I'm about to say
I grabbed the blunt and then it went this way
Eiht bucked a nigga down to the ground
And everybody heard about the Compton sound
Criminals to drug - dealers grouped with skan'less hoes
To the baby kids making the hood grow
Can you feel me? Gotta make my pay!
To the niggas that wanna kill me: I don't play!
Walk this way, no foul play I'm N 2 deep
One times make a nigga wanna play for keeps
Sometimes makes me wanna holler
How your homies from the same game wanna tame you for your dollar?
Nuthin' to lose, I choose to get a rep
Step, yep nigga, Compton 4 death, hit me

Compton 4 death...

Got a thousand for you bitches tryin' to handle this
Representin' Eazy E's Compton city G's

Another casket closed as the church choir blows

Niggas gon' pull up to pull a fast cap
Gotta get your - mean green to spend
Gotta get your mean green and blow weed my friend
To the Westside connect with these gangsta threats
Commence to represent them Compton streets

No time to think, my instinct's do or die
When I ride for the West Side nuthin' but high
Bitches don't cry

Cruise down the block, another hoodrat to hit
Pay attention while I mention how I been payin' dues
Since boulevard and corduroys and high school

[Verse 1: MC Eiht]
I was raised in compton, What the fuck, Cuzz'?
A nigga in the hood is always stuck
I'm tryin ta chase dead prez like Larenz Tate
But do it in dog mind-state
It's 187 on whoever don't stop
Throw away the strap right after the pop pop
Then ride shotgun, Pass me the handgun
I still yell out compton, Shoot and run
2 is double the trouble
Double up the work on game gon bubble
Couple of loco's from the westside, Homes
Dope in the coolo, Hand on chromes
One-time, Hoodrats, And beef wit the enemy
Niggas puffin so much, We smoke like a chimney
Little b.g.'s mane, Givin us the scoop
4 deep, Tryin to creep, Lights off in the coupe
[There they go, There they go]
We squash that in a jiffey
Creep up and shoot in the car just like 50
Click go empty, And it's back to the block
Cause CPT boys so hard knock
Lock up the work, Sell what it's worth
From the days of way back, The days of my birth
I'm so damn cold
One blunt in my hand, My bitch in a chokehold
The hood taught me lessons that can't be told
Whatever you push out, I'll come back eightfold
Sold out? Never, It's compton forever
No one can do it better
Geah, I doubt that
When the guns come out, Y'all could go flat
Now you could fuck all the chat and get a rat-a-tat-tat
Pat down ya pockets like we did in high school
You represent the hood, Always the first rule
I been all around the globe
Hop doggin for the hub like my name was kobe
Sirens, Flashlights, stroll lights
One-time, They never stop at a gunfight
2 compton motherfuckers

[Chorus 1: MC Eiht]
Geah, G-g-g-geah
It's 2 compton motherfuckers, 2 compton muh'fuckas
Geah, G-g-g-geah, G-g-g-geah, Nigga
It's 2 compton motherfuckers
G-g-geah, G-g-geah, 2 compton motherfuckers

[Verse 2: MC Eiht]
Strapped, Come out, Fall to ya knees
A blunt get lit then you beg a nigga please
One squeeze, I could silence the weeds
Another victim how the story reads
I needs no praise, Compton I was raised
Just bump some of my shit bitch and just blaze
Gimme a hit, Tilt, Yeah nigga what's crackin?
Some play too big, Nigga what's the actin?
I start callin out names
And commence to rob yo ass like Jess James
Me and Tha Chill backseat Boom Bam
3 the hood way, So nigga god damn
Slam, Dub dub dub
Let the gangstas run it in the fuckin hub
Wit a slug nose, a little penleton
Gauranteed to shoot the club up right before it close

[Chorus 2: MC Eiht]
It's compton muh-fucka, G-g-geah, G-g-g-geah

Fool you can't fuck with the straight up menace, nigga
It's time to pull your fucking card
Bookworm, let me see you squirm cause you ain't that fucking hard
Huh, you tried to put it to the test
But ain't no way your bullet proof vest can protect that bird chest, nigga
Call me the night creeper, the Grim Reaper
Like Boss is deeper, can't escape the street sweeper
Uh, say hello to the motherfucking tool
And try to pimp like you're so damn cool
Nigga, I fly heads, leave your whole family dead
Save the drama for your mama cause Eiht bucks lead
Yeah, I catch that ass up on the flip side
Eiht unloaded a clip and Quik died
I'm giving you a chance to get your bail on
I'm taking my nine and putting it to your fucking dome
Now throw your fucking hands in the air
When Eiht is evil cause I got the damn Desert Eagle, nigga
You on your ass like fast in a trap
Me? I fuck your ass like a hoodrat bitch in heat
Take two to your chin and punk I'm straight
Like I said in the beginning don't fuck with Eiht

Don't fuck with Eiht (Repeat 4x)

I need two straps to complete the task
Putting double up fucking wholes in your ass
Think fast, cause you ain't to quick to get dicked wit
You just another punk ass bitch talking bullshit
Uh, it's time to vamp, lick my nuts like a stamp
Before your ass breaks camp, you get fucked like a tramp
Named David, they should call you Silly Billy
Mark-ass nigga gets rolled like a philly
And you don't want to see me
DJ Quik in a khaki bikini
You're schiesty, keniving, skinny like a clucker
Must be smoking, you's a short motherfucker
You can't handle these things when I slang
Cheap like SWV you're too weak
Put your shit up on a hanger
Never could you fade a Compton banger
Nigga, I'm the one that'll make you cancel all your shows
Strictly for my niggas, so fuck them hoes
No sing no dance, no dance no sing
Just your bald-headed ass with your lips on my big fat thing
Def Wish 3, fool, I lay you to bed
Nighty night, motherfucker, take two to the head
Just some more Eiht shit for that punk that I pop
Uh, and it just don't stop, uh, and it won't stop
And it don't stop, uh, and it won't stop
And it don't stop, uh, and it won't stop
Uh, don't fuck with Eiht, bitches, sing

Don't fuck with Eiht (Repeat 4x)[O Dawg from Menace II Society]
"Oh nigga guess what!
Word got back about the little marks who jacked you!
I know where they be kickin it at
Down with a 187?"

[EIHT]
Eeerrr...
Geah
Geah
In the muthafuckin house, fool
For the 9 to the fizive-O
The Eihthype thugs in the muthafuckin house
Geah
And like my nigga E-40 say:
We got a colloseum of muthafuckas in here
Tha Eihthype thugs
C.M.W
N.O.T.R
Lil Hawk & Bird
Da Foe

I'mma hit you up with the T, so better scoot
Out the sunroof of the Coupe as I shoot
And ain't no crack, little cluck, it's just bullets that I'm slingin
Never-be-hangin, one-street-bangin
We don't be playin, fools runnin at the fuckin lip
Runnin, start runnin, you best not trip
Fast from the hip (pop pop) explodin
When the 9 mill starts unloadin
You better be watchin what you sayin
Cause niggas from 159th ain't playin
Trey's and 4's and houses start hittin your block
Mass hysteria, your bitch-ass gettin scarier
Don't wanna catch the slug
But you's a mark tryin to be a Tree Top Thug
Can't get no respect, well punk, then try this
Report your homies for domestic violence
For beatin your bitch ass up and down the block
Dash, David Gash, I'mma tap that ass

[O Dawg from Menace II Society]
"Now we just gon' find these little marks and smoke 'em
Shit it ain't that hard"

[EIHT]
I'mma tell you 'bout the time that we first met
The story that you told was some fake bullshit
It was me and Chill my pal
The scene was like the showdown at the O.K. Coral
It was you and then about five of y'all hangin
Standin in the center lookin like y'all was bangin
(Ain't nuthin but marks)
Approached me with your "P" hat
But I was high off the blunt, so I didn't see that
But I'm knowin I'm a nigga you love to hate
But you grab me by my shoulder and you conversate
I shouldn't've fell for it, I should've started slappin
Your eyes always dotted, you best stick to rappin
David Blake: you fake as fuck!
I mack your ass like a muthafuckin truck
I guess that eye was too black cause you still can't see me
Servin me a drink in your khaki bikini
Oh geah, just like I said before
Ain't nuthin but the ho on my dick
Little trick named Quik
Geah, quick to get fucked one time
You better be callin one-time before I pull out my nine
And nigga, checks this
Fill your Lexus full of holes as you slam into poles
Niggas should've just told me that you was a mark and
I wouldn't've hit you up with that notorious park
(You know where we from)
Can't fade it, better fear it
Got one of your little B.G.'s to write your fuckin lyrics
Playin around with the hood you get got
Nick name should be Spot for that eye you got
You and that fake muthafucka who wrote your rap
My nigga Boom Bam gon' slap with the trey-five strap
No muthafuckin truce
Get the ass cracked over the dome with the fuckin deuce-deuce
Don't make me have to act up
Cause you's a frail muthafucka with no back up
Original bangin on wax, nigga, you fake
'member One-Time Gaffled, nationwide blue tape
Original Compton representin to the T
Givin out slugs to you fake wanna-be's
Go run right through you
And before we kill off, remember the 'niew did it to you
Slick talkin, fast walkin
Nigga, how'd you figure that the E wasn't gon' stand and deliver?
You ain't worth a penny
Never had a damn eye, dotted so many
Times, two times, three times
You fall to the floor, you don't want no mo'
And if you wanna get with this you best to dash
Geah, cause I'mma tap that ass

West Side
Fool, you can't fuck with the gangsta niggas
Uh
Ain't nuthin but the new style, you know?
I likes that, 'the new style' for that ass
9 to the fizive-0, fool
You can't fuck with these killas
So stay the fuck back
And rounds up your little homies and shit
Cause we comes a 159 deep nigga
True Blue from the streets

On the West Coast so um watch out for the gangsta team
1-80-7 thousand G..G..G..G..G.......[King Tee]
Get a taste of the heat while I burn down the streets
Time to recognize who wore the white sheets
Gafflin me up and I'm fightin cause they got me
Known as a King knowin what they did to Rodney
I know you know the deal, it's open season on my race
I'm black and I'm proud to be lootin in your face
But yet I'm real smart, cause see, it's a plan
To lock up and shut down the black man

[Yo-Yo]
Yeah, you can play that role like you ain't with it if you wanna
But it's on to the break of dawn
I said it's just 'a few good men' when we were fightin
I guess it'll be more good men now we're united
Now all of a sudden they wanna bring in troops
Niggas in my hood been gettin loose and buckin fools
But now we're gettin wiser, you can tell by the fires
That they're fed up, the war is on us

[MC Eiht]
What happened to the drive-by killings?
Ain't nothin poppin no more cause brothers now chillin
From every hood to block to corner to street
Not black-on-black, the other color gets beat
Mh, I guess it's time for brothers to turn the page and
Let out some rage and bang a Caucasian
Geah, MC Eiht got the pale face runnnin scared
Gang of blue, fuck the white, I'm down with the red

[B-Real]
Doin dirt, at the time I thought it couldn't hurt
So I became a jackin expert
Lootin, scootin uptown cause they're shootin up a clown
That fuckin pig in the blue suit
That pig, sow, buster-ass copper
Pointin my bazooka at your pork chopper
You passed me a lump just a month back
That's why I got my hand on the pump, jack

[HOOK 2x]
You can get with that, or you can get with this
You can get the boot, or you can get the fist

[J-Dee]
Heary heary, y'all come kick it, man
I never thought I'd see a thousand Crips in the Nickerson
Gardens, pardon my manners
I saw the Bloods and Crips wavin big black banners
Bandanas tied, straps on their side
Cause in the projects it was a lotta black pride
And I remember the time I couldn't answer my pager
Cause if you were slippin your enemy come and gauge ya

[KAM]
It's the KAM and Watts Up, damn, this is like a dream
It feels good, cause every hood is on the same team
Archrivals got the five-o's kinda nervous
They layin in the cut but I know they wanna serve us
And I'm certain it's hurtin Daryl Gates
He rather have a brother pressin California license plates
While the media gets greedier for ratings
It's 12 o'clock at night but I'm rollin gold Daytons
And it's cool cause ain't nobody trip but the cops
Deep jeep bass comin from the rag top

[Threat]
It took more than a letter to pull us black together
But that goes to show you, never say never
I seen the tape, I didn't have to see it twice
Never seen nothin like it in my life, 12 blind mice
Is this the end, where we begin
Makin friends with Mister Chen?
From the dirt to the streets to the avenues
Way, way deep, deep in the Zoo

[Ice Cube]
Would you believe
Not guilty, the filthy devils tried to kill me
When the news get to the hood the niggas will be
Hotter than cayenne pepper, cuss, bust
Kickin up dust is a must
I can't trust a cracker in a blue uniform
Stick a nigga like a unicorn
Born wicked, Laurence Powell, foul
Cut his damn throat and I smile

[HOOK 2x]
You can get with that, or you can get with this
You can get the boot, or you can get the fist[Verse One: Young Aidan]
A fucked up childhood, but I ain't trying to complain
Just trying to go obtain, whatever I can to get some fame
But that ain't what I'm in it for, humbled from beginning poor
Remember all the visions torn, with nobody giving more
Then a single fuck about him, people never stuck around him
Went in with everything, but there never was an outcome
Home life was so trife, such a cold description
But that I'll have to talk about another time, know its written
Thats just life though, it is ice cold
When you might go, is un-quite known
Back to the topic I was not with any group in town
But I just threw the smile I used in doubt through the clouds
Where do I go without a soul to be hitting up?
Nobody knows but I may just be letting up
I ain't lived enough to try that ending just
Hoped and prayed for one day that I'll be getting up

[Hook: Young Aidan]
Getting up
Getting up
Getting up

[Verse 2: Young Aidan]
Some fucked up teen years, still ain't gonna complain
Coming up with one way, to make it in this one lame
World with no opportune-nitty, how I got in tune to be
On the block and shoot, now to hoop or off a dude, really
Its just thats just whats expected of me, all the Borough will cook
Moved to Guildwood for a bit, but I was still hood
Now I ain't trynna promote the life, but wanna show I know its like
To know right from wrong, but to know it gets you left for life
Always loved Hip-Hop, so I thought I'd write it down
Recited loud, and the sight has now turned into quite a sound
Help the next one up going through everything expressed above
Try to make the best of what they're given to go step it up
And right now, you probably didn't get it but
Remember what I said though, because I think I've said enough
Don't care who be ahead of us, no pressure but the message just
Is talk now, its time to rock because a young'ns getting up

[Hook: Young Aidan]
Getting up
Getting up
Getting up
Getting up

[Bridge: Sample from the intro of the video for "Live Your Life" by TI]
Sometimes on the way to where you're going you might think
This is the worst time of my life
But you know what?
At the end of the road if you can get where you wanted to be
You remember what don't kill you makes you stronger
And all of the adversity was worth it

[Verse 3: Young Aidan]
One fucked up life, Im grateful I got the chance to live
Cause at the end of the day, I got a chance to live
I won't lie, I wasn't always playing silly putty
Pretty gully, chilling bummy with nothing ever given to me
You can see the kid is hungry, nothing else will fill the munchies
Everyday Im getting higher, nothings going to kill the buzz he
Making, its amazing, how I came in on Awakened
Now I'm staying, in this lane and never taking a vacation
I used to cry for help, I've learned to wipe my tears
Turning my darkest of secrets into some bright ideas
I used to cry for help, I've learned to wipe my tears
Being a bitch will never work, not going to try Madea
Am I clear? Im grateful for this blessing but
I curse in each verse out of amazement I'm getting what
I've always wanted; and there is no guessing what
Is coming next, please enjoy, this is Young Aidan: Getting Up

[Hook: Young Aidan]
Getting UP
Getting UP
Getting UP
And now I'm Getting UP[Mack 10]
Let me do some shit with my niggas from the CPT, ha ha
You ready Eiht?

[MC Eiht]
Yeah, c'mon

[Verse 1: Mack 10]

I was born to ride, bang and pack heat
Got turned out early by the scandalous freaks
Addicted to crime so I stay in the mix
With a love for hoochie chicks and pullin jewelry licks
Moms said, "Mack, baby watch for danger"
I said, "Momma don't you know I'm a real gangbanger?"
I can't switch over night and be good
And I'll be damned if a nigga turned his back on the hood
So I walked out the door, hopped in the Regal
Twistin triple gold with the all black Eagles
Got a deuce, fired at Scoop's, I need a gat
So I stopped and got the Tech from my G-homie Wreck (whatup)
He said, "Mack, don't slip dog, u gotta stay heated
And here's the extra clip in case you might need it"
Get the eighty eight skate, ang get your slide on
Throw the Hoo-Bang plaque in the back and your ride on

[Chorus: Mack 10]
Ride for me, I'mma ride for you
You Hoo-Bang, I Hoo-Bang, so we all a crew
Get yo ride on, get yo slide on, who the best
Nobody rides like these killas from the west

Ride for me, I'mma ride for you
You Hoo-Bang, I Hoo-Bang, so we all a crew
Get yo slide on, get yo ride on, who the best
Nobody rides like these killas from the west

[Verse 2: Eazy E]
1, 2, 3, and to the 4
Eazy muthafuckin E with the chrome to your dome
Cruisin in my 6-4 rag top
I got a lot of juice, a lot of fuckin block
Now when I hit that switch I'm bouncin
More Bounce to the Ounce and I'm clownin
Keep the gat in my lap cuz I'm fully strapped
For the car jackers, but no haps cuz I pack a
Tech 9, plus a A-K 47
Send a one way ticket to my hell or maybe heaven
Peep, nigga I don't sleep
Bury muthafuckas in the concrete
You try to creep kinda slow in a Astro
But I peep you niggas out in my left window
So I blast and I blast till I blast no more
Yo, they call a motherfucker John Doe

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: MC Eiht]
Real thugs roll cuz the Westside's sick
Which enemy depicts to catch the 9 clip
Slick, but not like Rick, the gang story
G's kill and ain't shit funny like Joe Torre
Don't make me laugh cause I'm on the wrong the path
Catch the blood bath, it's the aftermath
Slang strike to make money, now ain't that simple?
Y'all silly niggas wearin' vests but we aim for the temple (brrrrrrr)
Watch my nigga's back, who sacked the yayo
Keep the calico with extra ammo
So and so gets blasted, to the casket
Never seen these westside G's face, we masked it
Ya'll best be defeat and be discreet
Catch the hot heat from across the street
Take me in the dump schools that, wanna push me
Retaliation, straight better than hittin' pussy

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Ugh, MC Eiht in the muthafuckin house
(yeah, Hoo-Bang one time)
Yeah, ha
(Hoo-Bang two times)
Rest in peace Eazy E
(the hiphop thugsta)
(yeah)
Fa sho
(Mack Dime)
Come on, ugh
(all day baby, all day baby)
WESTSIDERIDERS!! Ugh[Intro]
Geah, We in the muthafuckin house for the 94
Eihthype in the muthafuckin house
Geah, MC Eiht and DJ Slip in the muthafuckin house
Uh, Compton in the house, nigga
Compton in the house, fool
Compton in the house, bitch
Geah

[Verse 1]
You can nail me to the muthafuckin wall
You can bust me in the head with gatz
But punk ass nigga I'll be back, geah
You fucked up when you tried to blast on this trigger
Nigga didn't smoke my ass with the
Fuckin blood runnin down my back
I pull the muthafuckin strap on the sneak attack, uh
Load the hollow points into the hot Glock
Got my eyes on the crib at the end of the block
Don't give a fuck who's inside
His little sis' caught the fuckin slug so I jumps in the G-ride
Feelin cold as I look at the murder metal
Hear the sirens so I hit the mutherfuckin pedal
Tyres got to spinnin, I can see the smoke
Could barely catch my breath as I start to choke
Off the blood, from the 38 slug that was planted in my back
Damn that was wack
Dip through the back streets so I can slide out
The G-ride to my homie Chills to hide out
Dump the mutherfuckin Glock, it was dirty
Bammed on my nigga door, damn Chill heard me
He opened up the door and I fell straight in
Passed out for a second cause I lost my wind
Woke up to hear the mutherfuckin weed and Chill looked up and said:
"Damn Eiht you bleedin!"
Niggas they pulled the fuckin sneak attack
Fucked around and caught 2 to the fuckin back, geah
Niggas was buckin tried to put me down
Some punk muthafuckas from across town, uh
You won't be chalkin up one for your sorry set
Ain't dead yet
Just label me a deadly threat
Get Boom Bam on the mutherfuckin phone
Get the 19 shot cause nigga it's on
I know the spot where them punk niggas chill
Hit their hood with the big black steel
I do it my way like M.J
Slam dunk these hollow points in you, punk
No time to think about it twice
Leave these muthafuckas in traps and scattered like fuckin mice
Boom Bam meet me at the spot, I'm shot
I don't give a fuck they gon' get got
One time's on my dick, fuck it
Jump out, run through the alley to the bucket
Now the bullet starts to travel, I caught a shiver
But fuck it like the mail man I'll deliver
I hoppes out the bucket and I'm bleedin bad
But fuck it don't sweat it cause I'm too damn mad
Don't give a damn of who's in the line of fire
Grabbed the 'K and kneeled down by the tyre
They bust at me and I bust back
Boom Bam bring up the rear with the fuckin Mac
I buck one in the chest he start to beg
"Let me live"
I slipped, caught one in the leg
My nigga Bam let the mutherfuckin Mac spit
Here comes Tha Chill over the fence, fuck this shit!
I grabbed the 'K and kicked in the front door
90 rounds spittin as I catch 2 more

And this is going out to all the Compton G's, geahNapster didn’t invent peer-to-peer music sharing networks, rap music fans did. Before rap was ever recorded in corporate studios, or distributed to millions via articulated lorry or fibre optic cable, it was sold, shared, and swapped by thousands of New York’s poorest youth. The spread of affordable – and recordable - cassette tape players from 1975 onwards (see graph below) was the technological tinder on which New York City’s rap scene first ignited. Without it, rap music as we know it probably wouldn’t exist.

Though the data in the graph do not show trends specific to rap music, they do show the transition from vinyl to cassette tapes as the “industry standard” recording medium in the U.S. It seems a fair assumption that the sale of ever increasing numbers of tapes (as seen on the graph) is a good measure of how many people used tape players, and thus the market penetration of the technology. The critical distinction between cassette tapes and vinyl – for those who haven’t spotted it yet – is that tapes gave music fans the ability to duplicate content via tape-to-tape recording. No reproductive method this simple, fast, effective, or cheap had been available to consumers before, and it changed the market for recorded music in some fundamental ways. The graph shows the steady rise of cassette tapes as the recording medium of choice from 1975 to 1990, the period that rap music emerged as the cultural production of some of America’s most deprived young people.

Was this mere coincidence? Or was the rise of cassette technology intimately linked to the spread of rap music in its earliest years? I would argue that coincidence barely figures in this story.

In 1992, musicologist[1] Simon Frith wrote that the “the rise of rock [music in the 1950s had] depended on a broader social change – the appearance of youth as a pop music market.”[2] Similarly, many years before rap became extensively commercialised - and its audience became majority white - the rise of rap music depended on the appearance of black youth as a music market. New technology played an important part in this process.

Recordable cassette tapes revolutionised the market for recorded music.  With blank tapes cheaply available, home recording virtually removed cost as a barrier to the consumption of music. For the first time (in history?), a fan’s ability to privately consume their favourite artist’s music was not limited by their ability to pay for it. Many early rap fans in the Bronx - and other similarly deprived inner city areas where rap first thrived - could not have afforded regular vinyl releases. But now they didn’t need to. Music was freely available to anyone with the desire to seek it out, and the few cents it cost to buy a blank tape.

New York rapper Nas referred to this as the “cassette lifestyle”.[3] It consisted of spending large amounts of time compiling personal mixtapes by listening out for favourite songs to record from the radio, or by trading sections of sought after music with friends.[4] With cassette technology, enthusiasm and perseverance could be substituted for purchasing power, and this simple fact resulted in unusually high levels of cultural consumption amongst some of America’s poorest youth.

Although most rap music could be compiled onto personal mixtapes for free, a vibrant market in cutting edge rap music also began to develop. Hip-hop journalist Havelock Nelson described a man he saw selling tapes on the streets of New York: “The same way drug dealers whisper and gesture when attempting to make a sale, that’s the way this brother was hawking tapes. I guess hustling is just in the blood of some brothers, and hip-hop was the latest hot commodity.”[5]

Many famous rappers used these cheaply produced tapes to promote themselves at the start of their careers. “Groups like the Fearless Four started making home tapes which they sold… in the streets of Queens, Manhattan, and the Bronx.”[6]  These tapes were often “given out to friends, to cab drivers or to kids with giant tape boxes” to help spread the new sounds.[7] The low cost of reproduction meant that a rapper’s music could spread virally through social networks, and a rapper could achieve local cult status with almost no promotional costs.

Rapper MC Eiht said:

"I started doin’ little tapes for my neighbourhood, talkin’ bout the homies [read as ‘local youth’] and the niggas we didn’t like ... [Then] all the homies hear your tape [and] next thing you know, you got fifty niggas ridin’ around with your tape [playing]."[8]

During the 1970s and early 1980s, rap music was largely excluded from commercial radio, and wasn’t played at most mainstream discos or nightclubs either. Informal sharing via cassette tapes filled this promotional void, and became a substitute for access to traditional forms of publicity. As rapper Lil Rodney Cee explained, “Rap was travelling through tapes so people was [sic] coming from Jersey who had family in New York. [And] they’d hear the rap tapes and them back to Jersey.”[9] This peer-to-peer promotion established rap as an authentic cultural form, and developed a broad, committed, and responsive fan base on which later efforts toward commercialisation built.

It is difficult to imagine how rap music could have achieved a similar level of market penetration in communities with such low levels of disposable income without the advent of exceptionally low-cost reproduction and distribution technology. It is also challenging to estimate the precise impact of this technology.

Probably the best estimate of the extent of bootlegging and home taping came from an investigation into the “pass-along” rate of The Source, a monthly hip-hop magazine aimed at the same market. Its editor, James Bernard, estimated a pass-along rate of 11-15 readers for every copy sold; a rate three to four times higher than the average magazine industry pass-along estimates.[10] Given that tapes could be reproduced so that the lender could retain the original copy and still distribute the music to friends, the true pass-along rate for tapes is likely to be far higher than even Bernard’s estimate.

Cassette tapes, and the peer-to-peer networks they spawned and developed, meant that audience demographics for mass-distributed music included, for the first time, people who could not afford to pay for it. The result was a remarkably broad social fan base amongst some of the poorest consumers in the U.S. Without this technological innovation it seems unlikely that rap would have spread as far or as fast.

Though this method of distribution did not initially generate large profits for rappers or record labels, both the breadth and commitment of this social fan base would later become the basis for a new approach to monetising rap music, and eventually all music: cross-promotion.

So the next time you hear about how Napster invented peer-to-peer sharing, or how viral content is a new phenomenon reliant on internet technology, you can tell them about New York in the 1970s, where poor young people with tape decks, radios, and a few friends and strangers to share with, started the world’s first modern music-sharing network, decades before a Tweet was anything more than a sound the birds made.

[Verse 1]
All I try to do is stack dough
Anywhere that I can get it man, y'all don't know
I've been in this since the beginning man, check my flow
And my words gonna bring drama, boy, it's gonna show
I'm serious
Just like Steady B
Hoping I don't get caught for robbery
It's a motherfucking jungle out here all day
Shots rang out in the place I stay
And that's my word
Trying to stack, cop a bird
Being the motherfucking nigga is the word I heard
I'm on the curve
Feet up, blowing the herb
Do Not Disturb
We moved out, weighted the birds
(Hey)
You don't see no welcome mat
Niggas like bitches might turn to wraps
Play Crip niggas might change the stacks
Never mind the mic status, I'm still strapped with gats
G-yeah!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Anybody get it, boy that means you
Nightmare of Compton is all true
Another nigga dead so what you gonna do?
A small fraction of what we go through
There's murder in the town, trying to put in work
Then watch out, cause jealous fools might go berserk
He see, she see, they scheme a plot
Of being a beer memory, what? Eiht gets shot
Not!
Imma shoot for the dough
And keep squeezing the trigger till my finger's sore
You'll be another victim who fucked with colors he wore
You'll be the first dead nigga on my reality show
Gangsta with no calls
And I could run through the clips with no faults
And sometimes that means life behind bars
Finally dumb lady young hero's stars
You get it?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Street Life got me oh so hooked
Get what I split or get your shit took
Don't look, Imma say fuck the math
And let me finish my task, no questions asked
Niggas still struggling, niggas get mine
At any given time, so I keeps the nine
One time, with the flashlight, trying to shine
Loaded, motherfucker's way out of line
I'm a borderline psycho, I ain't like no
Other motherfucker with an AK Rifle
The bitches say "You so trifling Eiht!
But I still want you to fuck me, and I can't wait."
Late Night, the domestic fight
The neighbors call the cops and I take flight
You nosy motherfuckers know that ain't right
Hope I cross your path, get it down on sight
G-yeah!

[Hook]
