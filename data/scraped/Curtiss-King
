[Intro]
Quiero vivir como los árboles
Breathe easy!
Trees, trees, trees
Soul!
I just wanna, I just wanna
LT3 shit, nigga, look

[Verse 1]
I just wanna live like the trees
Shoot the breeze, stay around some leaves, you nah mean?
But I'm about to go on tour
Can't wait for wind, pollination to plant my seeds in the soil
Around '07 TDE struck oil
It's my turn, Mr. LongTerm of turmoil
I'm holdin' up the terminal takin' flicks
I'm irritated but they're the reason that I'm gettin' rich
Cheese, give me an upgrade, see
Then I'll be on my way, I'm on my way to NYC
Last time I was there I swear I sold out SOBs
In Times Square with my circle of G's, you nah mean?
You shoulda never gave us niggas money
We comin' for everything, you nah mean?
Fuck you niggas with your hands out
Suck my third leg while I branch out

[Hook]
Cause I just wanna live like the trees
Shoot the breeze, stay around some leaves, you nah mean?
But this money got me on the run
And it don't grow on trees, I'm tryna get me some
Get me some, get me some, some, some
Get me some, get me some, some, some
Get me some, get me some, some, some
Shit don't grow on trees, breathe easy!

[Verse 2]
I got most of you mothafuckas stumped
Rap like I go to church with work in the trunk
Lord forgive me but my pennies turnin' into dubs
I'm losin' my sense, they say I changed up
And I don't feel no different, I'm still the same nigga
Maybe my brain's bigger, gettin' brains quicker
Used to cop a little deuce
Now I cop a whole case of Actavis to give Sprite stock a boost
Ab-Soul, yeah I'm gettin' loot
Bitches walkin' bow legged out my dressin' room
Was at the Travelodge but now we at the W
Just to shower, be out in an hour, I got shit to do
Plenty empty Backwood packs in your face
And my backpack more OG than your hood, dang
Hey, can't live without the Benjamins
But I'm interested in photosynthesis

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Me and she sittin' in a tree
K.I.S.S.I.N.G
First comes love, then comes marriage
Fuck that! I'm just tryna get up in your panties
Where the trees, trees, trees
Where the trees, trees, trees, trees
Burn the mothafuckin' trees, trees, trees, trees
With the trees, trees, trees, trees

[Interlude: Joey Bada$$]
It's still world domination
Keep a Backwood and a mothafuckin' eighth and
Always got the trees, so what the fuck you mean
I ain’t about to rise to the top with my fuckin' team
Nigga it's still world domination
Keep a Backwood and a mothafuckin' eighth and
Always got the trees, so what the fuck you mean
I ain’t about to rise to the top with my fuckin' team

[Verse 3]
Heaven ain't far Curtiss, it ain't far at all my nigga
Check, Joey I know I told you, quote it in a verse
But we called it the third eye when it could really be the first
Wha gwan Jah no rassclat me
I took it to heights these parasites can't see
Rarely do I bark, hope you get the analogy
Top Dog embarkin' on the whole industry
Niggas get to bitin', I be like breathe easy!
Your cardiovascular isn't fast enough
I'm Canibus smokin' cannabis, sippin' Actavis
Before the Mathers diss I used to work at Magic Disk
With a dollar and a dream, why you think money is green?
Color of vegetation, the most important thing
Trees

[Outro]
Gimme some, gimme some
Gimme some, gimme some
Gimme some,gimme some
[Part 2: Produced by DJ Dahi]

[Intro:]
Ay yo Dahi what up, my nigga? Drop that shit!

[Verse 4: Ab-Soul]
Uh, I feel like I'm finished Soul searching
I feel like I know my Soul purpose
Colder than a Winter Solstice, you're a dope dealer if you sold this
Yo, Soul everywhere if you ain't notice!
(YEAH!)
Solar power, solar system, told you so
You was a compartment in your car, you couldn't console
(YEAH!)
Known to consolidate hope into those listenin'
Nothing but facts and tracks I'm solicitin'!
(YEAH!)
Soul Plane, Soul Train, those are no-brainers
Soul So thick, to defeat me would be amazing
A day and a half, in these 8 and a halves
I solidify why I’m the greatest to rap
(Soulo!)
Top Dawg soldier, hoes call me Soulo
(YEAH!)
I left America with a bottle of Soul Glo
So everywhere Soul go? Soul gon' shine
Everybody knows like Beyonce and Solange!
Uh, what the fuck is Soul on?
We really out here but we ain't at the Salon
Look, a pair of Persols that cost like fo'
Kid from Del Amo, with a flow that's so universal...
Soul!
...
Oh-oh yeah and I'm the soul-lution nigga!
Soul-lute me!
That was a stretch...
I'm Ab-Soul-lutely the best
Yeah![Intro]
I'm prolly all alone on this one...

[Verse 1]
See, I just wanna take my chopper and aim it right at that copper
Who just locked up my partner, they can't stop us
I'm prolly all alone on this one, I'm prolly all alone on this one
I'm prolly all alone on this one, I'm prolly all alone on this one

[Bridge: Alori Joh]
Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale
(I'm prolly all alone on this one)

[Hook: Alori Joh]
Who's bold enough to rebel? Rebel?
(That's the joint, that's the jam, turn it up, play it again)

[Interlude]
I might be all alone on this one...

[Verse 2]
I just wanna grab that heater, run right in the cathedral
Aim it right at that preacher for miseducating the people
I might be all alone on this one, I might be all alone on this one
I might be all alone on this one, I might be all alone on this one

[Bridge: Alori Joh]
Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale

[Verse 3]
I just wanna take that banger and aim it right at my Maker
For placing me 'round all this danger, I can't even trust my neighbor
I know I'm all alone on this one, I know I'm all alone on this one
I know I'm all alone on this one, I know I'm all alone on this one

[Bridge: Alori joh]
Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale
(I know I'm all alone on this one)

[Hook][Hook]
Post traumatic stress, PTSD
If you from the hood then you just like me
Niggas kick in your door for a PS3
How the fuck do you expect me to be stress free

[Verse 1: Murs]
Home boy ask me if I been to the surface
Standing on stage taking flicks got me nervous
All up in my face when I'm trying to be working
Sit your fat ass down behind that curtain
Bitch I'm from the land of the Bloods and the Crips
Niggas kill niggas just to fuck a bitch
You could lose your life for that busta shit
By the time I was 9, see that [?] shit
Lost more homies than a Iraq vet
Niggas skipping on groceries to buy that Tec
Lost a few friends to a rival set
And I'm still tryna process them side effects
Extra clips, extra clips
I see them niggas now when I'm [?] trip
Gangbang party time, excellent
Not giving a fuck's a prerequisite
My testament is so trill
For the represent is so real
My residents got evidence I'm a legend [?]
Pills to the crack game
Stills in the rap game
Every nigga rapping tryna feel up that lane
Back to the backstage
Punk for the photo [?] catch that fade
Fuck your badge
Now you wanna ask me why I'm so mad?
Get your ass beat for a photograph
Get the fuck out my dressing room 'fore I go bad
The homies laugh, I kept it moving
When they gon' learn that there's more to music
I do this shit so I could feed my kids
So they never have to know what a repo is
You really think you know how my people live?
You think you down because you know who Deebo is?
PTSD on my emo shit
Deep down in my heart, where the evil lives

[Hook]
Post traumatic stress, PTSD
If you from the hood then you just like me
Niggas kick in your door for a PS3
How the fuck do you expect me to be stress free
Post traumatic stress, PTSD
If you from the hood then you just like me
Niggas kick in your door for a PS3
How the fuck do you expect me to be stress free
You really think you crazy? Bitch let's see

[Verse 2: E-40]
I ain't playing with a full deck
I been going through a lot of shit
Put holes in you like a hairnet
Emptying the clip
You picked the wrong nigga to fuck with I ain't with that fake shit, I don't play it
I'm on some real time
Ain't no time to be dealing with these phony ass bitch boys
[?] my pocket and I stay with a [?]
This a Rolley bitch, hell nah it ain't a false one
Used to push bricks, but now a nigga push [?]
Cause G's on your head like a [?]
Had a hood yelling brothel celebrating and whatnot
Happy cause he almost terrorizing the whole block
Breaking into homes, stealing anything they got
Nobody at his funeral, nobody cried a drop
Post traumatic, PTSD
My people wanna work, no J-O-B
These bitches wanna twerk, shake they boo-ty
To pay they college tuition, that's what they see on TV
They mommy and they daddy drop the ball on 'em
They ain't never there when they call on em
The ways of the world, the worldly ways
We living in the last days for our [?]
And all the real rappers with a lot of shit to say
The kids now-a-days think they whack today
Cause my favorite rapper doesn't sound like they
How the fuck you expect me to be stress free?
If you from the hood then you just like me

[Hook]
Post traumatic stress, PTSD
If you from the hood then you just like me
Niggas kick in your door for a PS3
How the fuck do you expect me to be stress free
Post traumatic stress, PTSD
If you from the hood then you just like me
Niggas kick in your door for a PS3
How the fuck do you expect me to be stress free
You really think you crazy? Bitch let's see[Pre-Hook]
This is for the days I wasn't strong
The days I was alone
And nobody answered the phone
And all you niggas stunted on me
On me on me on me on me
And all you niggas stunted on me
On me on me on me on me

[Hook]
I'mma show you how to bounce back because I can
All the days that I felt pain ho
Bet you never heard complaints though
Bet you never thought I prayed slow
I could took my shots, took my loss
Did my very best and I gave my all
Ain't nobody there when I made that fall
So ain't nobody here when it's time to ball

{Verse 1: Curtiss King]
Bang Bang, like the pull upon a trigger
I came up out the barrel
And now I feel incredi
Because we came from the bottom
And now we're doing better
No I still ain't got no car
But at least we on the road to cheddar
I say finally, cuz ironically
I seen niggas make all kind of cheese
And never give a slice when its time to eat
I broke bread with you but you played for keeps
You was thirsty for shiny pennies
But lucky for I, eyes on the prize
I was resilient in pivotal times
Where I ain't had shit but a dream in my mind

[Pre-Hook]
So hate me if you want
I don't got time to even bother
I say fuck that that nigga Cancer
Because he stole my grandfather
This is for the day I wasn't strong
The days I was alone
And Nobody answered the phone
And all you niggas stunted on me
On me on me on me on me
And all you niggas stunted on me
On me on me on me on me

[Hook]
I'mma show you how to bounce back because I can
All the days that I felt pain ho, bet you never heard complaints though
Bet you never thought I prayed slow
I could took my shots, took my loss
Did my very best and I gave my all
Ain't nobody there when I made that fall
So ain't nobody there when its time to ball

[Verse 2: Curtiss King]
Bang Bang, like a soldier lighting a cannon
From a distance It look like a flash, but I ain't a camera
And this ain't a fad
This for the nights I felt abandoned
Broke without an answer
Just Top Ramen and Fantas
Throw a couple Brew In, where's O'Bannon
I was so stressed I wanted a hammer
To end this shit but nigga I Manned UP
My skin gotta a little adamantium
And the wheels started rolling, where the hamster?
Where my Kings and Queens who got standards
My nigga we so outstanding
They say middle fingers up to haters
But I say fuck that nigga cancer

Chorus
So hate me if you want
I don't got time for all them feelings
You need to hate on that nigga Lupus
Cuz he took our nigga Dilla
This for the Days I wasn't strong
The days I was alone
Nobody answered the phone
And all you niggas stunted on me
On me on me on me on me
And all you niggas stunted on me
On me on me on me on me

[Hook]
I'mma show you how to bounce back because I can
All the days that I felt pain ho, bet you never heard complaints though
Bet you never thought I prayed slow
I could took my shots, took my loss
Did my very best and I gave my all
Ain't nobody there when I made that fall
So ain't nobody there when its time to ball[Intro]
This one's for everybody who went to leapwood, annalee or Broadacres, went to Curtis, and graduated from Carson High

[Verse 1]
Yeah
You mighta caught me walkin on annalee
On my way to work, I ain't no jerk, you can wave at me
Faithfully I strafe from all the make-believe,pray for me
This the shit they make-up make me think maybe its maybelline
They will not disable me, even Kane afraid of me
Now niggas wanna network like A&E
City on my back like a superman cape would be
Ab-soul, asshole, why you act an ass for?
You ain't even got your own pad you a tadpole
It's a future ahead of you, why you looking back though
Frontin like you in the front when you in the last row
Microphone check 1, 2 are you hearin this
Curtiss king will tell you I'm a lyricist, lyricist
Been a trip before I caught a flight, alright?
Why you think I'm always smiling, im nice
Rapper's delight, that titles suffice
I dont even think he existed but my idol was christ
I too have a passion for what I feel is right
That's why I get high as a Wright brother and write

[Hook]
Cause I just need'em to remember me
Before im dead and gone write my name in history
Mentally, im meant to be, infinite, energy
Martin Luther King of Carson, peace to my enemies
And cause this is Long Term 2
And every one of my dreams will all come true
This a journey we all go through
And if you can't cut it then it's all on you

[Verse 2]
I had to be about two
All I remember was Charlie Brown and Dr. Seuss
Momma read me a bed-time story every night
Comprehended so well I thought it was all true
Thats all truth, 20 years later
I became a wordsmith like a kid from will and jada
Took a fifth of henny to the head and thought ahead
Why they worrying bout my buzz, I ain't a insect
What the fuck, yall got me fucked up
(what the fuck, yall got me fucked up)
Don't get a nigga misconscrued
Cause I get loaded like a brand new pistol, ahhh shoot
Long as you knew that I'm on the pursuit
Of greatness 'til I lay in a tomb, im raiding
The game is weak, knowing its painful and not short
However long it take just know im not going

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
(Heaven ain't far Soul)
Yea, I swear to god I wrote this on annalee
On my way to work, im late, I know my momma mad at me
(PEACE) to all the homies formerly known as casualties
Prospect, I miss you man I do this shit for you
I revise my timelines see how I do
2000 I was cool, '01 I had fun
'02 I recorded my first song and I was sprung
'03 I was deep, '04 I had flow
'05 I signed a Street Beat with no dough
'06 I met punchline, Damn I thank punchline
He saw more in my music than metaphors and punchline
'07 DudeDawg told me I was family
In '08 you became a fan of me
'09 I went around the country in a rock band
Now its twenty-ten yall, get a catscan dawg

[Hook][Produced by Curtiss King]

[Hook]
I hope y'all motherfuckers glad I came
Strange Music won't ever be the same

[Scratches]
"Ask-ask-ask-ask-why I'm the strangest"
"Better bang this"

[Intro]
What up though? It's Murs
This boom bap shit for all the Strangers
Let's go
Curtiss King on the beats
You know who that is on the hook

[Verse 1]
Straight out the underground into the mainstream
The California kid cliqued up with the Strange team
Swing like a couple hundred swords when I say things
Crowned in this rap Game of Thrones, I remain king
Fire breathing lyrics hotter than Khaleesi is, burn 'em
Now your favorite rapper's hotter than he think he is
- - - - -  Fill in the Dylan reference
The game ain't been the same since the icon left us
A stand up dude but ain't shit funny
When they say you ain't the greatest cause you ain't getting money
But back when I was broke I was doper than most of 'em
Known to grab the microphone snap like I broke something
Rappers coming at me, gun's blazing won't smoke nothing
They need to turn them into journalists trying to quote something
Murder they careers, I'm America's most wanted
Sprinklin' their ashes on a blunt, yelling, "Smoke something."

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
A lot of rappers say they different but they sound the same
Run around bite each others style without an ounce of shame
Me, I've been Strange before the dreadlocks grew out
Dropped the major labels, shook the liquor, took a new route
Clones attack the radio, so I align with the rebels
Underground recording in the basement of the devil
But rhyme at God level, I'm superior yet similar
People say they peep the DNA and see my signature
Menace throwing mics, I treat rap like its sacred
Young conscious brothers still trapped in The Matrix
Offer me the red or blue, I went and took the purple pill
Trippin it 'til Tech and Trav offered me the perfect deal
Now worth a mil, I work to kill for the snake and bat
Fans see the skill and beat is real, ain't no faking that
Take it back to '91, go platinum with the beads on
Back to resurrect this rap culture that they sleep on

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
We made !Mursday! the world favorite holiday
Thank you based God, namaste
Hallelujah, hope the lord is with you all the way
Hope you Have A Nice Life is what I'm trynna say
A million angels got my back, born from L.A
So you should really watch your mouth with what you trynna say
Since my last video I heard I'm kinda gay
I just ate my wife pussy, I'm OK
Nowadays everybody wanna share they song
Music ain't worth the megabytes that they shared it on
Rapping on the same track, them niggas went to Paris on
Get a couple clicks on Soundcloud and they swear they on
They ain't got the stamina to carry on
Can't sprint to the finish, it's a marathon
A year later, lookin' 'round like where they gone?
Disappear like panties on Nikki, when she wear a thongPure rap shit
Let's do this
No dubs, one take
Let's go

To which I reply:
Ain't no way in hell that you can muscle me homie
Only if you will try to fuck with me now they mushing baloney
Ain't no ho can get between a horse and his dick
First second third fourth 'n the fifth
Of course I'm the shit
I've had so many women
I start to think I'm assisted living
I thought of Santa Clause for all the gifts my dick's been givin'
All them chicks been kickin' with 'em
All it is is pimpin-ism
Listen, women, Kaiser Von Powderhorn is up in your kitchen!
And these haters start to trippin'
I'm gettin' more money than a motherfuckin' Christian
True, young prof is a baller
You can call the hater line I'll pick the first caller
Sunk so many rappers
I'm a sure father
Been with your baby mama motherfucker, cute daughter
Don't make me bring her toys out
Motherfuckers know I get intense like boy scouts

I'm the greatest
Don't front, I'm the greatest
Bitch please, I'm the greatest
Fuck you, I'm the greatest
Suck my dick, I'm the greatest
Bitch please, I'm the greatest
Fuck you, I'm the greatest
Don't front, I'm the greatest

I'm fuckin' Lyndsey Lohan, broham
A player got her open
A trip to Vegas,  for a little eloping
I'm Beyonce's fiance, I'm picante
You lookin for a double date, Kanye?
Fuck it, there's a mermaid in my bathtub
The motherfucker's only there to give backrubs
How much an ostrich cost bitch?
Put it in a mosh pit
At my show and jump in like, "Watch this!"
Bitch please, got whiskey out the faucet
Little girls will hold my hair in case I get nauseous
Deal, mother fucker that's a bonus
Cut my girls hair so I can think I'm fucking Jonas
Oh brother, I don't slow brother
Everybody knows I'm a cold mo-fucker
I'm thinkin' this is the end
Like OMG, I've outdone myself again

I'm the greatest
Don't front, I'm the greatest
Bitch please, I'm the greatest
Fuck you, I'm the greatest
Suck my dick, I'm the greatest
Bitch please, I'm the greatest
Fuck you I'm the greatest
Don't front I'm the greatestThe homey Soul said I might be one of hardest working niggas that he's seen
When the Scumbags video was cut/scene and complete
And I took the footage home, when I could've roamed the streets
Reminising with Top Notch and my peeps
But instead I set up shop 50 miles from where I shot
In a box called my room trying to chop up scenes
Rendering in Vegas Pro and the clock said 3
My mama say I'm crazy because I'm up like a feign
But all I really need is 3 hours of sleep....Loni, all I really need is 3 hours of sleep
I named myself King and I don't take that lightly
Martin had a dream and it looked just like me
How can I complain? I'm still below the Angels
Even though I'm slaving 10 toes on the pavement
Even tho these hoes want to do a nigga shady
I really want yo mama anyways, yo ass basic
And since I'm going in I must commend my haters
Salute to you fuck boys side commentating
Now I see the reason why Marvin went on hiatus
Now I see the reason Chappelle took a vacation
But I can't take a break
Because 24/7 is a really long blessing and I'm only using 21
21/7 till heaven tell me to wrap it up I'm acting up
Till my mama's mansion got an aqueduct
Black Cloud tatted up, Tell me why you mad at us
Is it cuz our catalogue keeps adding up and adding up
It's bad enough you don't think that our journey was a hard trip
You new booties think this is an 80 yard sprint
But where your cleats at nigga, you got the wrong kicks
Shit, and I ain't on but I'm on it trick
And this is a graveyard shift
Until I'm in the graveyard bitch[Intro]
I'm prolly all alone on this one...

[Verse 1]
See, I just wanna take my chopper and aim it right at that copper
Who just locked up my partner, they can't stop us
I'm prolly all alone on this one, I'm prolly all alone on this one
I'm prolly all alone on this one, I'm prolly all alone on this one

[Bridge: Alori Joh]
Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale
(I'm prolly all alone on this one)

[Hook: Alori Joh]
Who's bold enough to rebel? Rebel?
(That's the joint, that's the jam, turn it up, play it again)

[Interlude]
I might be all alone on this one...

[Verse 2]
I just wanna grab that heater, run right in the cathedral
Aim it right at that preacher for miseducating the people
I might be all alone on this one, I might be all alone on this one
I might be all alone on this one, I might be all alone on this one

[Bridge: Alori Joh]
Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale

[Verse 3]
I just wanna take that banger and aim it right at my Maker
For placing me 'round all this danger, I can't even trust my neighbor
I know I'm all alone on this one, I know I'm all alone on this one
I know I'm all alone on this one, I know I'm all alone on this one

[Bridge: Alori joh]
Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale
(I know I'm all alone on this one)

And all you niggas stunted on me
On me on me on me on me

[Hook]
I'mma show you how to bounce back because I can
All the days that I felt pain ho, bet you never heard complaints though
Bet you never thought I prayed slow
I could took my shots, took my loss
Did my very best and I gave my all
Ain't nobody there when I made that fall
So ain't nobody there when its time to ball[ Intro]

{Verse 1: Echo]

I be on some other shit
Like an indecisive fly, ya bisshh
Pardon my French
But Je suis un probleme, monkeywrench
In the works, I'm a jerk
I turn this up near a hospital, TWERK!
Hip-hop circus, too many clowns
I'm new school clothes, you hand me downs
And class is in session, fuck you professors
I don't want a Box Chevy, I don't need a new Lexus
I don't need a gold necklace, I just want to rap reckless
Body any rapper in the game, on my checklist
Here to break the rap records, I'm a sell the most
I represent the universe, I don't rep coasts
I don't mean to boast, but nigga I'm the best
Physicist-lyricist, put me to the test and

[Hook: Echo]

If you don't give a fuck
Like I don't give a fuck
Say, put ya hands up, hey!, put ya hands up (4x)

[Verse 2: Echo]

I'm a conspiracy, a theory
An anomaly, so fuck with me
I'm a human Rubik's cube
I can be intellectually, rude
I'm exponentially that dude
Top Chef, cooking that, soul food
Stay glued to the screens my niggas
While I scream I want free my niggas
I'm getting bigger, while the world is getting smaller
All these rappers rapping about how they money getting taller
The people getting smarter, they no longer want to bother
With that watered down crack juice, you want to make them swallow
No longer will they follow like the wind behind the arrow
Hawk up in the sky, coming down on all you sparrows
Bird-ass niggas, stop fucking with us pharaohs
You featherweight rappers are heavyweight assholes

[Hook: Echo]

If you don't give a fuck!
Like we don't give a fuck!
Say, put ya hands up, hey!, put ya hands up (4x)[Intro]

[Verse 1: Internal Definition]
What more could I really ask
Sitting back in this two thousand dollar a quarter class
With my iPhone buzzing, future texting me back
Like slow down lil homie, your timings coming relax
But relax ain't a word I can swallow, I'm getting thinner
Show my Dad he bred a winner, cost of being a sinner
Missing my family's faces while sitting her eating dinner
But that's the cost of success, you lose it all tryna get more
But wait a minute, why success come with more stress
I thought life was suppose to be good living in excess
Express these feelings because rap is my only outlet
Hope to change your mind about me if there's any doubt yet
Never time to give my Grandmother a call back
Still find the time to respond to your little blog chats
Real issues scaring me, so hoping your hearing me
This is my real life, that fake shit you'll never hear from me

[Hook]
My train's leaving and I don't know when I'm coming back
I know you miss me (uh huh)
I know you miss me, know you miss me, know you miss me (Hol' Up)
I hope you miss me, hope you miss me, hope you miss me
My biggest fear's you'll forget me
My life's speeding but I hope I never hold you back
I know you miss me (uh huh)
I know you miss me, know you miss me, know you miss me (Hol' Up)
I hope you miss me, hope you miss me, hope you miss me
Just promise you won't forget me

[Verse 2: Internal Definition]
Stress is constantly consuming me
Feeling out of body like watching my own eulogy
Falling like the leaves as I get bigger like the trees
Burning deep is misery, burning like marijuana leaves
Mixed with glitz and glamour and this Southern Cali swagger
When friends turn to foe dogg, what does it really matter
Lost a best friend who I use to tell everything
Know you still hearing me, missing you more than anything
But wait a minute, why they seem to see me different
Exactly who I use to be, at least who I pursue to be
Investing in myself, I'm not talking about internally
Talking about the view of me I wanna show this industry
Losing focus of what my family means to me
I'm just tryna be a Top Dawg like Willie B
Feelings run deep as I bored my train to destiny
Life is like a test, welcome to the university

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Internal Definition]
It's feeling like fourth and goal
I remember when changing the world was my only goal
What about me and my future son, how I'm gone feed a kid?
What about me and my girl dogg, where we suppose to live?
Is she ready for the challenge of her man up on the road?
Only taking her calls late nights after them shows?
Constantly stressing if her life is really on that track
Because once I get my break girl I'm gone and I ain't looking back
But it's crazy because your the one who inspired me
If I had to choose now who's holding more weight inside of me
Of course I'd say it's you, these feelings building inside of me
Probably tear us apart if I didn't rid them apart of me
Damn, but I promise we gone make it
Anything you wanted I promise that you'll be laced with
Just accept the sacrifices it's gone take me to make it
Watch a dollar and dream turn this man up into greatness

[Intro: Murs talking]
Do you ever watch TMZ and be wondering why the fuck Justin Bieber does some of the shit he does? It's because he has a little black baby in his fucking head telling him what to do bitch! (hahaha)

[Verse One]
Smoking loud with hella random black dudes
Shirt off showing off my fucking tattoos
Red and white flag swag is Canadian
We in that Fisker we ain't ride in no Mercedes Benz
Uhh
And I'm spitting on the paparazzi
Richest motherfucker in the world can't nobody stop me
Selena Gomez, that's my old bitch
And I'm 'bout to clone that ho because I'm so rich
Miley saw me swagging and she lost her fucking mind
I need to smack that bitch for trying to block my fucking shine
I'm on my grind
Shout out to my Beliebers
They ain't old enough to drink but homie I ain't either
But I'm old enough to blow on some hookers bro
And bitch, bet I buy an island when I book a show
My pops the same color as my white tee
Am I Justin Bieber's black baby?
Bitch I might be

[Hook] {x4}
Heeeeey
I'm Justin Bieber's black baby
Justin Bieber's black baby
Justin Bieber's black baby

[Verse Two]
Will Smith put me up on Scientology
Men In Black, reading Malcolm X biography
Couple of guys up to no good
King Sean tried to get my ass kicked out the neighborhood
Caught one case, moms got scared
So I fired that bitch when I was live on the air
Yeah
My security can't hold me back
Call TMZ, LAPD if you see me on the attack
I'm the mahfucking Bieb' bitch
Ask Usher mahfucker cause I keep him rich
I made a movie
They all did the same thang
Now I gotta show One Direction that it ain't a game
Aim it, cock it, shoot it, pow
Who's the king of pop now?
Somebody tells these motherfuckers that they need to bow down
My pops the same color as my white tee
Am I justin' Bieber's black baby?
Bitch I might be

[Hook][Intro]
This one's for everybody who went to leapwood, annalee or Broadacres, went to Curtis, and graduated from Carson High

[Verse 1]
Yeah
You mighta caught me walkin on annalee
On my way to work, I ain't no jerk, you can wave at me
Faithfully I strafe from all the make-believe,pray for me
This the shit they make-up make me think maybe its maybelline
They will not disable me, even Kane afraid of me
Now niggas wanna network like A&E
City on my back like a superman cape would be
Ab-soul, asshole, why you act an ass for?
You ain't even got your own pad you a tadpole
It's a future ahead of you, why you looking back though
Frontin like you in the front when you in the last row
Microphone check 1, 2 are you hearin this
Curtiss king will tell you I'm a lyricist, lyricist
Been a trip before I caught a flight, alright?
Why you think I'm always smiling, im nice
Rapper's delight, that titles suffice
I dont even think he existed but my idol was christ
I too have a passion for what I feel is right
That's why I get high as a Wright brother and write

[Hook]
Cause I just need'em to remember me
Before im dead and gone write my name in history
Mentally, im meant to be, infinite, energy
Martin Luther King of Carson, peace to my enemies
And cause this is Long Term 2
And every one of my dreams will all come true
This a journey we all go through
And if you can't cut it then it's all on you

[Verse 2]
I had to be about two
All I remember was Charlie Brown and Dr. Seuss
Momma read me a bed-time story every night
Comprehended so well I thought it was all true
Thats all truth, 20 years later
I became a wordsmith like a kid from will and jada
Took a fifth of henny to the head and thought ahead
Why they worrying bout my buzz, I ain't a insect
What the fuck, yall got me fucked up
(what the fuck, yall got me fucked up)
Don't get a nigga misconscrued
Cause I get loaded like a brand new pistol, ahhh shoot
Long as you knew that I'm on the pursuit
Of greatness 'til I lay in a tomb, im raiding
The game is weak, knowing its painful and not short
However long it take just know im not going

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
(Heaven ain't far Soul)
Yea, I swear to god I wrote this on annalee
On my way to work, im late, I know my momma mad at me
(PEACE) to all the homies formerly known as casualties
Prospect, I miss you man I do this shit for you
I revise my timelines see how I do
2000 I was cool, '01 I had fun
'02 I recorded my first song and I was sprung
'03 I was deep, '04 I had flow
'05 I signed a Street Beat with no dough
'06 I met punchline, Damn I thank punchline
He saw more in my music than metaphors and punchline
'07 DudeDawg told me I was family
In '08 you became a fan of me
'09 I went around the country in a rock band
Now its twenty-ten yall, get a catscan dawg

[Hook][Produced By Curtiss King]

[Verse One]
She got a Fat Booty
It's Black On Both Sides
She posting pics on Instagram with them open thighs
You know I don't mind
The eye candy
I'm from west L.A
She from south Miami
No and he's fucked around and her account deleted
Shout out to Hollywood Ho and the crew, Treated
I don't play for pussy
But yeah I fucking eat it
Now she cooking breakfast in my sweats
Undefeated
Private parking
There ain't no walk of shame
Got that guard at the gate, there ain't no stalker games
And if she don't got brains
Then she don't got game
She's sucking dick for bottle service that's so fucking lame

[Hook] {x2}
I've 'bout mo' Taylor Swift than Beyonce
Don't need no meat on my entree
I guarantee what my rhymes say
Mos definitely that's Dante
Mos Def my nigga that's Dante
Mos definitely that's Dante
Mos Def my nigga
Mos definitely
Mos Def my nigga that's Dante

[Verse Two]
She got a Fat Booty
I'm so ecstatic
She got that New World Water, what's the Mathematics?
True Magic
She newly tatted
Plus she keep a head wrap
Erykah Badu status
Conscious flow
Fuck you obnoxious hoes
I want a chick with some knowledge and some perfect toes
That mani/pedi game gotta be righteous
Cross fit put a fat ass on white chick
Do them squats girl
And rap
Zero carbs, paleo she ain't got no fat
A strong woman?
That's The New Danger
Real niggas love her
Bitch niggas gotta hate her

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
She got a Fat Booty
It's black and tan
Coming straight outta Brazil, now I'm a Travellin' Man
Selfies in the mirror, looking healthy from the rear
She the type that got me on a flight twice a year
I say "Brigada."
She say "De nada."
Portuguese and Spanish, "[?], hold my enchilada."
I wish Cube fucked J.Lo in Anaconda
So my black mamba could hit Sofia Vergara
Colombiana
Zoe Saldana
Watching 8thstreetlatinas, that's my favorite genre
But love my Black Star, she the X rated kind
Brown Skin Lady, if you ask her she won't say she mind

[Hook]

I want my people to be
To be, to be
I want my black people to be
To be, to be
I want my people to be
To be, to be
I want my people to be
To be, to be free

My umi says {x6}
Shine your swag on the world
Shine your swag for the world to see

Ohh yeah yeahGrindin’
I’m on the grind, I’m on the grind
You might have been once but I’m on it all the time
I’m on the grind
You might have been once but I’m on it all the time
I’m on the grind
You might have been once but I’m on it all the time
I’m on the grind
You might have been once but I’m on it all the time

[Verse 1]
All them haters thought I’d drop, thought that I would flop
Said I’d only be a superstar on the block
Low key on the grind, yes sir on the clock
I told the folks “Wait, I’ll return with a plot”
The boy’s Phil Jack, the boy’s Byron Scott
I’m figurin’ a game plan to get me to the top
Big house for my mom, I think I gotta shot
Gotta get that money right, rather grind, not floss
They wondered if I slipped, prayed that I quit
And put the pen down, naw homey you was wrong
I been on the grind, slicin’ up my pie
Tryna share the shine, see homey you was wrong
I kept it low key, them other cats lied
I made dope beats, 6 to 7 every night
But keep it low key, they think you fell off
But I ain’t got the time, time, time
I’m on the grind

[Hook]
I’m on the grind
You might have been once but I’m on it all the time
I’m on the grind
You might have been once but I’m on it all the time
I can’t sleep at night, I’m on the grind
You might have been once but I’m on it all the time
I’m on the grind, I’m on the grind
You might have been once but I’m on it all the time

[Verse 2]
All you haters go to sleep, give me some peace
All I hear is moanin’ and cryin’, how I ain’t got that fire
But, excuse me, I think somebody laced yo weed
And you ain’t about that life, get the hell up out my sight boi
Eeny, Meeny, Miny, Moe
I got too many ways I can make this dough flow
Haters know that I’m gettin’ hella close
Been grindin’ for a minute, now a King about to blow
And I know that they wishin’ me harm
But the Lord got my arm so I can reach through the storm
I wasn’t born to be norm, my life I adore
So I need to get this poppin’ baby till I get some more
So

[Hook]
I’m on the grind
You might have been once but I’m on it all the time
I’m on the grind
You might have been once but I’m on it all the time
I can’t sleep at night I’m on the grind
You might have been once but I’m on it all the time
I’m on the grind I’m on the grind
You might have been once but I’m on it all the time

[Bridge]
I can’t sleep at night
I can’t sleep at night
I can’t sleep at night
I said, I can’t sleep at night

If you on the grind, baby you should smile one time
You should smile one time for me
If you on the grind, baby you should smile one time
You should smile one time for me[Produced by Curtiss King]

[Hook]
Yea, I'm so out of it, out of it
Thought I made it really clear
I do not belong here
I'm so out of it, out of it
They just want the same thing
We just wanna change things
I'm so out of it, out of it

[Verse 1]
Let's go
I'm gliding through the wind, spread high
Yea, sorta close
Peaks and valleys, know my limits
I don't know no borders though
No concept of county lines, no concept of altitude
Freedom move about the country, the air here's kinda cool
Ask 'em 'bout dinosaurs
I tend to think we kinda new
Ask 'em 'bout carnivores
Yea bro that's my kind of food
Tryna trip a ?, up
I think it's kinda rude
Like me cause I'm like them but I'm not
So I'm just kinda cool
Plus I know this climate too, well
Just to sort of miss it
Know to listen, fail to act
Perhaps cause I feel sorta distant
Still close, I rhyme different
And still boast, tell 'em what time is it
Be on jetlag, with no spacecraft
Gravity don't exist so you pissed we replaced that?
Flowing open over oceans
Outer space with no emotion
Hoping if we get 'em open
They could be moved by our devotion

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
They keep tryna figure me out little me now
Some punks start little me now, feeling me out
They don't know
Went in a match, went in a drought
We still grow
Let's reexamine, what is it now
You really found new info
With or without, living it out
We been dope
?, figure it out
So simple
In it but not of it
They love, they wanna see it
They ?, they wanna be it
They covering ?, human beings
I'm killing with the emceeing
I'm running the whole show and expecting you ?
To do it the way I did it, I did it the way I loved it
Moved I how we did and did it with no grudges
Oh, we don't fit
The labels won't touch us
We started our own and did it with no budget
Wait
I don't know if that's something I should brag about
On second I thought I don't know if I should've ever taken this rapper out
I'm a dreamer I admit
Maybe I should close my eyelids and go back to clouds
Cause I'm outta this world
Even up I still see clear like that's my house
And that's the way, bread
Even as a castaway said
Even if I pass away, led on my feet with my God
I sin, so I'm cool
Outta this world, may face ridicule
Imma keep flying high as we flying by
Only way we know how to move, truth

Intro: Uniiqz Global!

[Verse 1]
Phone calls, pick ups, drop offs
Get the cash then I'm gone
Lay up in her criddy
Rollin' fifty's of that loud noise
Bitches smokin' like they Indians
And we fuck em like we cowboys
Passing you bitch like a cypher
Gassing her up where's the lighter
Roll another one up let's get higher
Bitch called me peter because I piped her
You's a handy man pansy man macgyver
Goons on deck gunman on call with the sniper
Red dot forehead then fire
Niggas shittin' bricks need a diaper
Tell em it's real life no survivors
Your bitch ain't safe so don't hide her
Fuckin' with niggas berzerk
Gettin' you murked in the dirt
Crackin' a smile with a smirk
Fuckin' ya bitch in her skirt
Back stage at my concert, Danny brown your ho!
She swallowed my kids for dessert
Then I kicked the bitch out your home
Stickin' to basics throw her a towel
Kickin' her out twist her head like a owl
Twistin' a joint smoking that foul
She lickin' my balls then cock in her mouth
Reggie Mills ya'll know the name
Smoking bin laden I'm bombin' your dame
Fuckin' her brains, i'm fuckin insane
I'm a God of the Gods bow down and praise
Kiss on my feet get down and embrace
Watch me go skeet and cum on your face
Wait , how does it taste , Go
Lemme switch up the pace
Chug a mind eraser and roll up that space
Shit I'm smokin' on will leave you defaced
Bring your bitch around me, I'mma put her in her place
Feeding her zanies coke and the bass
Actavis, purp, molly, and yurps
Got what you need if you needed that work
Three phones hit me up on a chirp
Sike nah, trap phones and a curve
Blackberries GPS out they ain't tracing my shit
Mobbin' and robbin' these hoes on my dick
Get the phattest bitch out have her boofin' a brick
DEA ain't got shit on my shit
Cuz i'm checkin' into tellys couple ounces and some bando
My set and DJ rep hard that's my band yo
Everywhere we show up you know we gotta po' up'
That H town & hennesy that Heineken that roll up
A couple bad bitches finna fuck in dakota
On tour now nationwide get inflicted
This shit is ridiculous , the goal is go global
Turnt up and stay with it from coastal to coastal
I'm soulful, souls full of dreams and ambitions
I'm living the shit that I'm spittin' I'm winning
The women and the whips are foreign
Fans worldwide nigga and I support em
Bands, cash money and the guap (make it)
Make It, all I know is stack dollas (its nothing)
Over me it's nothing , (nothing)
Over you is god (god) , Reggie

Last night I had the whole club rocking, beat steady knocking
But today I felt bummy with no money in my pockets
My nigga you can laugh
But the ratchets still jockin'
Even though I'm feeling bummy
Man, the ratchets still jockin'


[Curtiss King]

How Ya feel
How you feel when you got insufficient income
You just payed the bills and now its lent inside your denim
And all you ate today was just a microwave dinner
Your friends say you thinner but you know you ain't been lifting
Cuz you didn't have enough to pay the month at LA Fitness
You ain't joggin' cuz you starving ain't no reason for no dishes
I remember bummy days at the park on the benches
With no funds in the pocket and no crumbs for the pigeons
And you wouldn't believe it
I bet you think its magic
Somehow I got attention from a sexy lil ratchet
Somehow I got the digits and my flat top getting patted
And to think I left my pad in some leisure wear fashion
So whats happenin', wassup, got that Axe fired up
Yes, I know its not cologne but the ratchets still on it
I said whats happenin', wassup, I'm a rapper on a budget
And guess I'm sort of dope cause the ratchets still love it bitch


[Bridge]
I ain't on I ain't on I ain't on but I'm on it trick
I ain't on I ain't on I ain't on but I'm on it trick
I ain't on I ain't on I ain't on but I'm on it trick
I ain't on I ain't on I ain't on but I'm on it trick

Last night I had the whole club rockin', beat steady knockin'
Today I felt bummy with no money in my pockets
My nigga you can laugh
But the ratchets still jockin'
Even though I'm feeling bummy
Man the ratchets still jockin'


[Verse 2]
How you feel how you feel in my dilemma
Sittin in the club sippin water with some lemon
And everybody know me cause I'm always on my grizzle
And my threads look official
Shout out LA Mental
If they didn't keep me fitted
Best believe I'm busy thrifting
For some shit that ain't expensive
From the 90s that was pimp shit
Bernie Mac would've paid attention
And smiled at my intentions
Till I asked him 'bout the cookies 'n shit in the kitchen
But who in hell in twenty twelve would dress like me
I don't really know bout fashion so excuse my apathy
If you catch me in the club with no Polo on my tee
And them niggas yelling YOLO you should know they not with me
There are days that I feel lower than the bottom of the sea
Till a ratchet came around and put her bottom on me
I said whats happenin', wassup, I'm a rapper on a budget
And guess I'm sort of dope cause the ratchets still love it bitch


[Bridge]
I ain't on I ain't on I ain't on but I'm on it trick
I ain't on I ain't on I ain't on but I'm on it trick
I ain't on I ain't on I ain't on but I'm on it trick
I ain't on I ain't on I ain't on but I'm on it trick
I'm on it trick


[Hook]
Last night I had the whole club rockin', beat steady knockin'
Today I felt bummy with no money in my pockets
My nigga you can laugh
But the ratchets still jockin'
Even though I'm feelin bummy
Man the ratchets still jockin'Pure rap shit
Let's do this
No dubs, one take
Let's go

To which I reply:
Ain't no way in hell that you can muscle me homie
Only if you will try to fuck with me now they mushing baloney
Ain't no ho can get between a horse and his dick
First second third fourth 'n the fifth
Of course I'm the shit
I've had so many women
I start to think I'm assisted living
I thought of Santa Clause for all the gifts my dick's been givin'
All them chicks been kickin' with 'em
All it is is pimpin-ism
Listen, women, Kaiser Von Powderhorn is up in your kitchen!
And these haters start to trippin'
I'm gettin' more money than a motherfuckin' Christian
True, young prof is a baller
You can call the hater line I'll pick the first caller
Sunk so many rappers
I'm a sure father
Been with your baby mama motherfucker, cute daughter
Don't make me bring her toys out
Motherfuckers know I get intense like boy scouts

I'm the greatest
Don't front, I'm the greatest
Bitch please, I'm the greatest
Fuck you, I'm the greatest
Suck my dick, I'm the greatest
Bitch please, I'm the greatest
Fuck you, I'm the greatest
Don't front, I'm the greatest

I'm fuckin' Lyndsey Lohan, broham
A player got her open
A trip to Vegas,  for a little eloping
I'm Beyonce's fiance, I'm picante
You lookin for a double date, Kanye?
Fuck it, there's a mermaid in my bathtub
The motherfucker's only there to give backrubs
How much an ostrich cost bitch?
Put it in a mosh pit
At my show and jump in like, "Watch this!"
Bitch please, got whiskey out the faucet
Little girls will hold my hair in case I get nauseous
Deal, mother fucker that's a bonus
Cut my girls hair so I can think I'm fucking Jonas
Oh brother, I don't slow brother
Everybody knows I'm a cold mo-fucker
I'm thinkin' this is the end
Like OMG, I've outdone myself again

I'm the greatest
Don't front, I'm the greatest
Bitch please, I'm the greatest
Fuck you, I'm the greatest
Suck my dick, I'm the greatest
Bitch please, I'm the greatest
Fuck you I'm the greatest

[Verse 1]
Straight out the underground into the mainstream
The California kid cliqued up with the Strange team
Swing like a couple hundred swords when I say things
Crowned in this rap Game of Thrones, I remain king
Fire breathing lyrics hotter than Khaleesi is, burn 'em
Now your favorite rapper's hotter than he think he is
- - - - -  Fill in the Dylan reference
The game ain't been the same since the icon left us
A stand up dude but ain't shit funny
When they say you ain't the greatest cause you ain't getting money
But back when I was broke I was doper than most of 'em
Known to grab the microphone snap like I broke something
Rappers coming at me, gun's blazing won't smoke nothing
They need to turn them into journalists trying to quote something
Murder they careers, I'm America's most wanted
Sprinklin' their ashes on a blunt, yelling, "Smoke something."

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
A lot of rappers say they different but they sound the same
Run around bite each others style without an ounce of shame
Me, I've been Strange before the dreadlocks grew out
Dropped the major labels, shook the liquor, took a new route
Clones attack the radio, so I align with the rebels
Underground recording in the basement of the devil
But rhyme at God level, I'm superior yet similar
People say they peep the DNA and see my signature
Menace throwing mics, I treat rap like its sacred
Young conscious brothers still trapped in The Matrix
Offer me the red or blue, I went and took the purple pill
Trippin it 'til Tech and Trav offered me the perfect deal
Now worth a mil, I work to kill for the snake and bat
Fans see the skill and beat is real, ain't no faking that
Take it back to '91, go platinum with the beads on
Back to resurrect this rap culture that they sleep on

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
We made !Mursday! the world favorite holiday
Thank you based God, namaste
Hallelujah, hope the lord is with you all the way
Hope you Have A Nice Life is what I'm trynna say
A million angels got my back, born from L.A
So you should really watch your mouth with what you trynna say
Since my last video I heard I'm kinda gay
I just ate my wife pussy, I'm OK
Nowadays everybody wanna share they song
Music ain't worth the megabytes that they shared it on
Rapping on the same track, them niggas went to Paris on
Get a couple clicks on Soundcloud and they swear they on
They ain't got the stamina to carry on
Can't sprint to the finish, it's a marathon
A year later, lookin' 'round like where they gone?
Disappear like panties on Nikki, when she wear a thong[Produced by Curtiss King]

[Intro]
Quiero vivir como los árboles
Breathe easy!
Trees, trees, trees
Soul!
I just wanna, I just wanna
LT3 shit, nigga, look

[Verse 1]
I just wanna live like the trees
Shoot the breeze, stay around some leaves, you nah mean?
But I'm about to go on tour
Can't wait for wind, pollination to plant my seeds in the soil
Around '07 TDE struck oil
It's my turn, Mr. LongTerm of turmoil
I'm holdin' up the terminal takin' flicks
I'm irritated but they're the reason that I'm gettin' rich
Cheese, give me an upgrade, see
Then I'll be on my way, I'm on my way to NYC
Last time I was there I swear I sold out SOBs
In Times Square with my circle of G's, you nah mean?
You shoulda never gave us niggas money
We comin' for everything, you nah mean?
Fuck you niggas with your hands out
Suck my third leg while I branch out

[Hook]
Cause I just wanna live like the trees
Shoot the breeze, stay around some leaves, you nah mean?
But this money got me on the run
And it don't grow on trees, I'm tryna get me some
Get me some, get me some, some, some
Get me some, get me some, some, some
Get me some, get me some, some, some
Shit don't grow on trees, breathe easy!

[Verse 2]
I got most of you mothafuckas stumped
Rap like I go to church with work in the trunk
Lord forgive me but my pennies turnin' into dubs
I'm losin' my sense, they say I changed up
And I don't feel no different, I'm still the same nigga
Maybe my brain's bigger, gettin' brains quicker
Used to cop a little deuce
Now I cop a whole case of Actavis to give Sprite stock a boost
Ab-Soul, yeah I'm gettin' loot
Bitches walkin' bow legged out my dressin' room
Was at the Travelodge but now we at the W
Just to shower, be out in an hour, I got shit to do
Plenty empty Backwood packs in your face
And my backpack more OG than your hood, dang
Hey, can't live without the Benjamins
But I'm interested in photosynthesis

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Me and she sittin' in a tree
K.I.S.S.I.N.G
First comes love, then comes marriage
Fuck that! I'm just tryna get up in your panties
Where the trees, trees, trees
Where the trees, trees, trees, trees
Burn the mothafuckin' trees, trees, trees, trees
With the trees, trees, trees, trees

[Interlude: Joey Bada$$]
It's still world domination
Keep a Backwood and a mothafuckin' eighth and
Always got the trees, so what the fuck you mean
I ain’t about to rise to the top with my fuckin' team
Nigga it's still world domination
Keep a Backwood and a mothafuckin' eighth and
Always got the trees, so what the fuck you mean
I ain’t about to rise to the top with my fuckin' team

[Verse 3]
Heaven ain't far Curtiss, it ain't far at all my nigga
Check, Joey I know I told you, quote it in a verse
But we called it the third eye when it could really be the first
Wha gwan Jah no rassclat me
I took it to heights these parasites can't see
Rarely do I bark, hope you get the analogy
Top Dog embarkin' on the whole industry
Niggas get to bitin', I be like breathe easy!
Your cardiovascular isn't fast enough
I'm Canibus smokin' cannabis, sippin' Actavis
Before the Mathers diss I used to work at Magic Disk
With a dollar and a dream, why you think money is green?
Color of vegetation, the most important thing
Trees

[Outro]
Gimme some, gimme some
Gimme some, gimme some
Gimme some,gimme some
[Part 2: Produced by DJ Dahi]

[Intro:]
Ay yo Dahi what up, my nigga? Drop that shit!

[Verse 4: Ab-Soul]
Uh, I feel like I'm finished Soul searching
I feel like I know my Soul purpose
Colder than a Winter Solstice, you're a dope dealer if you sold this
Yo, Soul everywhere if you ain't notice!
(YEAH!)
Solar power, solar system, told you so
You was a compartment in your car, you couldn't console
(YEAH!)
Known to consolidate hope into those listenin'
Nothing but facts and tracks I'm solicitin'!
(YEAH!)
Soul Plane, Soul Train, those are no-brainers
Soul So thick, to defeat me would be amazing
A day and a half, in these 8 and a halves
I solidify why I’m the greatest to rap
(Soulo!)
Top Dawg soldier, hoes call me Soulo
(YEAH!)
I left America with a bottle of Soul Glo
So everywhere Soul go? Soul gon' shine
Everybody knows like Beyonce and Solange!
Uh, what the fuck is Soul on?
We really out here but we ain't at the Salon
Look, a pair of Persols that cost like fo'
Kid from Del Amo, with a flow that's so universal...
Soul!
...
Oh-oh yeah and I'm the soul-lution nigga!
Soul-lute me!
That was a stretch...
I'm Ab-Soul-lutely the best
Yeah![Verse 1: Ab-Soul]

Straight out of Carson, Asshole, Ab-Soul
Broke in probably '05 like my graduation tassel
Everybody treat me like I wake up in a castle
The little engine that could
More horsepower than a saddle
And why would I battle
When these other niggas infants with the penmanship
Shit, that ain't a mic, that's a rattle
As soon as you remove your bib we can get it in
Stand up nigga, even when I'm sittin' in
Pull your pants up nigga, getting too big for your britches
You fucking with a dude that did it with no digits
Just dope written, you're spoiling the art
Like a kid with no siblings, uh
And I'm still the most pure
Even having unprotected sex with a coach whore
Hip-hop till my heartbeat cease
I ain't a cash cow, but I do eat beef
Movin' in the right direction, map quest the cross streets
If you cross reference all of my efforts with perfection
You'll see I pole vaulted like an election
Over the bar ya'll raised, or the standard ya'll set
Never with the extras, on or off set
It's a rap, not a lecture, you ain't gotta pay attention
But I'm a music soul child, please just listen
And my mother ain't the virgin Mary
But I'm so religious with the lyrics I'm a Christian
On the verge of crucifixion, Non dash fiction
You lower class livin' with your poor performance
You're bringing the house down, fuck a mortgage
Fuck a chain, I'm a free man, first name Morgan
And when I die I'mma donate organs
Show 'em how it look to be this live on the inside man
And know I had it mapped out like the inside man
I ain't robbing no banks I'm just real strategic
Greedy as a motherfucking glutton
Both hands in the pot like I'm paraplegic
I take pride in knowing no one is remotely close
Soul brotha number two, even a dead druggie ain't overdose
Get a clue like blue
Cause even niggas with the flu ain't in the stu like dude, uh

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]

And I'm still on my shit
Just like Elvis I'mma die on my shit
I'm holding my pelvis writing this shit
Middle fingers up to those who oppose
Like when niggas started wearing skater clothes
I kept a fresh pair of vans, but who didn't
And in my city I'm the man, but who isn't
It's the untold story of the unknown glory from the unknown city
Don't show me no pity
Ab-Soul, Carson, we gets busy
Really I'm from Del Amo!
Who's with me?
(Soul!)[Verse 1: Ab-Soul & Kendrick Lamar]
I'm a soldier mane, thought I told ya mane
I aim and flame ya, I'm the pro-to-pane
Niggas sizing me up like I'm buying a tux
So I interrupt, crease 'em, iron 'em up
With the nina, not talking 'bout the two singers
Cause a leprechaun wouldn't even press his luck
I'm sure to pluck any chicken with a rhythm I could fuck
I tell 'em call me up
Like is it on or what, can I cut 'til dawn, or what?
A slut say she want a slice of all of us
Intelligent, say her marble's marvelous
She go down south like black colleges
I'm a psychologist, I tell her I can adjust
Anything in the world that be bothering her
Everywhere I go, guarantee she go
Pussy pop on the low like a silencer

[Bridge: Ab-Soul & Kendrick Lamar]
Back to the realest shit, cop a car, mash that
Crash that, then I'm back at the dealership
Diamonds on my necklace, diamonds on my left wrist
Diamonds on my right wrist, damnit I'm the brightest
Back to the realest shit
You an exclamation, fuck an explanation

[Hook: Ab-Soul & Kendrick Lamar]
Better watch yo lady!
(Boom!) Bounce (Boom!) Bounce
(Boom!) Bounce (Boom!) Bounce
Better watch yo lady!

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul & Kendrick Lamar]
Back to the realist shit, niggas ain't raw
You grilling, I'mma menage a woman and I
Barrage, be intimate, a massage beginning with
Caress from her tongue, deep throat raw
Lot's of trauma, ya baby momma
Brain is crazy: Jeffrey Dahmer
And I'm finna shoot like a dirty llama
Big truck kicking up dust: conquer
Chocolate seats: Willy Wonka
Passenger: Pretty Woman
Directed back, bring ya compass
You bringing Carson, you bringing Compton
Y'all bring the nonsense, we bring the real
Like pro tools, never gross 500 mil
And we out in Brazil, in the green like Blankas
Bonkers, tell 'em Top Dawg is here!

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul & Kendrick Lamar]
I think it's that give us that back
Whatever war you bring, send me to Iraq
I rap like my tongue was sitting on a match
You struck by lightning, frightening, gotta be a Heisman
Trophy, lowkey, the one and only
Slay a ho, play a ho like an oldie
Yup, and I'm dope like Opi
Um, so I'm out when the police
Come, like a nut, I'm a nut
For the bucks like a shotgun bust, and I bust
Venom inside the brains of young dames
Like Mr. Dash speaking to his kids on Jay-Z
We running the game
Y'all slipping like run in the rain
Ya bitches running away from y'all to us
In God we trust, at y'all we bust

[Bridge]

[Hook][Verse 1: Sinclair]
I'm a freaky fruit loop
Frosty colored coupe
Smoking Blue's Clues
Never wearing Trues

He said that she said that I was the shit and
I said what you said has got to be legit
So I cockslapped my girl, just for revines
Yeah I fuck around, but I'm never wastin' time

Bumpin' old school Nirvana in your mom and dad's sauna
Sippin' OJ in mimosas yeah I'm talkin' Tropicana
Now what up Obama
I'm comin' for that office
Sinclair for president, somebody please stop him

I dare ya
Versace sun glarin' ya

Eatin' wonton soup with my boy BasedGod

[Bridge]

Oh my god BasedGod
Oh my god BasedGod
Oh my god BasedGod
Oh my god BasedGod

You can fuck my bitch anytime BasedGod
BaaaasedGod

OhmygodBasedGod

[Verse 2: Sinclair]

I'm a ticking time bomb
Somebody call my mom
Out here in Vietnam, napalm on the tongue

Spit the fire so hot that I perspire
If not, then I'm retired
No sleep I'm never tired
Acquire the listeners, inspire them to be themselves

I think that Christ is rising
Sinclair, or Escobar?
I think I need help, need to gain self
I ain't never been a Buddhist maybe I'm in myself
I keep my eye on myself, worry 'bout nobody else
Tell my brothers better than life itself

Don't be suprised by the wealth
You'll be suprised by the stealth
Splinter cell in your headphones
This ain't good for your health

[Verse 3: Dirty Mike]

Awwwwww man

You know I had to hit that YAWKSAUCE

What you got for 'em?

DIRTY
MIKE

Dirty Mike be smokin' green
Always posted with the team
Smokin' strong, sippin' lean
You know I'm gon' get the cream

Dirty Mike up in the zone
Twenty hoes with no clothes
You know how the story goes
Dirty spit the dirty flow

I'm throwing off the piff
I be rolling that stuff a lot
Lindsay Lohan
Patrollin' booty with my boy Dolan

Beer pongin' we never trolling, afterwards we neon bowling
With your girl her panties bawling, you know that your boy is ballin'
She callin
She come through

And then I gotta smash her
My dick the master blaster
Dirty Mike the pussy pastor
Gotta hit the booty faster

She's a pornographic actress
Had to spit the facts first
Shouts the homie Jasper

Fuck the Green Bay Packers, I'm a loud pack packer
Smoking like a rapper does, shouts out to Cam cause that's my cuz'
Packin' bongs for the buzz, smoking just because
Tell Sinclair to pass the dutch, Dirty Mike still smoking tough

Motherfucker
