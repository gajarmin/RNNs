[Verse 1: Planetary]
Yeah! Yo, uh
A lot of rappers try approaching the omen
My poems will punish your people while I’m up at the podium
Pharaohs folding 'em, like washed clothes again
I'm a vulture when the flow go choke your kin
Broke, I leave most of them, slow, I keep my motionin'
Eye on the prize
I silence the wise, my lyrics make a scientist cry
Making a secret society expose their purpose
Making 'em unleash info and explode in my surface
I'm taking my time to birth this, rap entity earthless
It's show time, there's no time, be ready when the curtain split
I'm hurtin' shit, too powerful for painkillers
On the concrete jungle we walk like trained guerillas
Untamed, and my niggas is Kane, Kool G, Rakim, combined into one frame
We like the new mecca of immaculate rappers
Vinnie Paz, call the goons, now we back with the clappers

[Verse 2: Chief Kamachi]
Yo, remain silent, kill him with what I mentally says
Bloody Fez, choke you like an Indian rez
Kamach, animal Turk, sick with a cannibal smirk
Welcome, this where the murderers lurk
It's my mind, that make sure that the Sun can work
Scorch bodies, leave all of your gunmen hurt
Pharaoh sultans, create a serious cult jam
And my hand is where the tears of the pope ran
They stay watching like they keep me on a scope cam
I'm in Heaven with the angels that smoke grams
You need God, that's why the earth so damned
International, trying to get my flow banned
That's cool, if I don't kick these prayers
A lot of floods and fam' is gonna hit these years
Kamachi back on the chapel stairs
Open the clouds, let the thunder clap your ears

[Verse 3: King Syze]
You wanna put your money up? Then muthafucker then put it
For your family's sanity man, I wish that you wouldn't
Niggas got nice flows, just dont know where to put it
And I know your whole life your raps are edited footage
And y'all mixtape niggas couldn't see my plateaus
All up in my presence, while y'all actin' bashful
King Syze casting an ecliptic rap flow
Y'all little light niggas couldn't feed my shadows
From, city to city, intersection to section
But you reflexin', with or without a weapon
I'm always steppin', never scared
But always and forever prepared
Yeah the ones who drink gas man is revvin' their gears

[Verse 4: Reef the Lost Cauze]
You now rocking' with the foulest clique in the continent
Total dominance, rise to prominence
In my prime like Optimus, stand in astonishment
At this conglomerate, an axis of evil
I know where Osama is, he down in Camp David
Down and dirty like a damp basement
The champ must demand greatness
From himself, or be another contender
There's hundreds of niggas
Dead left under the river
From the days of slaves
To hurricanes in Orleans
See my people's graves floatin' amongst the waves
There's hell to pay, but
The devil don't take checks
I tried to send a message to God
His phone don't take texts
I need a new plan, a crook with knowledge
Times is hard homie, why I took them dollars
Man, my momma got a mortgage
And my little baby sister need books for college
I rob all of y'all

[Verse 5: Doap Nixon]
Hey, yo, they want the hood in here so they called me first
I give 'em rappers gatorade cause they ball with thirst, UH!
This is more than music
But these niggas is mad trash
That's why the stores refuse 'em
Yo, I'm out in Georgia, went straight to the block
I'm seein' cats motorcyclin' dawg, I'm doin the walk
I'm an O.G., call my Italian niggas a wop
Though their papers ain't right, but they got weight on the block
I love 'em uh
Hand to hand, see your hands ache
I drunk so much syrup dawg I stopped eatin' pancakes
Ya niggas cool dawg mine's absurd hot
Stop frontin' like you's a killer money, your nerves shot
Yo you's a Paxil nigga, dumpin' Zoloft in coffee
AOTP what exhaust be
Can't keep it gear, cause I'm blinging with F's
But I got my mind right so swing your shit to the left

[Verse 6: Demoz]
Nigga if I had 24 hours to live
Fuck 24 hours, gimme 24 seconds
Vin I'm drivin' off a bridge
Broken rib, no windshield, covered in kerosene
Gasoline tank filled to the top
Magazines of these phony rappers ripped in pieces
No priest is, strong enough to take me out of my zone
I broke Jesus, choke niggas who squeal
Rob niggas who steal, kill niggas who kill
I'm too sick for a pill
Man these niggas ain't real, they real fake
They say they a man but they fuckin' reveal snakes
That's when you put 'em in a truck with their grill taped
Rip in reverse then run into a steel gate
I'm a suicide driver, never been a liar
If I don't kill you later, I'mma kill you Mañana
You don't want no problems
You don't want no drama
Nigga I'mma take a trip with your baby momma, suicide driver

[Verse 7: Celph Titled]
Ya better cross your T's
Cause we'll dot your eyes
You can say that you specialize but pharaohs will optimize
Backstage will get a bitch back smacked there
The mac glare like dirty south pimp slap clap snares, YEAH!
Holy paragraphs, what kind of shit is that?
I'm Jesus in the flesh so this is motherfuckin' Christian rap
Y'all just Christmas wrap, must be the secret Santa
My reindeer aim near, pierce you with the antlers
I made 'em go easy, and called off the wolves on my AOTP radio CB
Cause y'all ain't worthy of grenades and RPGs
Slit throat, hope you float with sardines and seaweed
Cause this is C-E-L-P-H demonic symphony
Listen to the hell we make
And a year before your kids tenth birthday came
You didn't have to wait for candles on the cake to see the nine flame

[Verse 8: Vinnie Paz]
Respect a G, my clique clap at you incessantly
I lay back and drink alcohol excessively
It ain't a rapper that's alive today that's testing me
I got degrees in being ignorant and weaponry
A 40 oz and Dutch Master is the recipe
That's my shit there, that'll be the death of me
Give me a death mask, better yet an effigy
I understand the math of death and it's complexity
I understand how you was violently murked
I understand how you was raised under the lies of the church
But understand and recognize that I'm cursed
With the ability to end your fucking lives with a verse[Intro - Bizarre]
Reel Wolf, underground shit
I guess I'm up first, right?
I'mma rap first?
Alright, let me hit this blunt right quick

[Verse 1 - Bizarre]
I'm the sickest motherfucker on this earth
That'll fuck a transvestite, dog, or blue Smurf
Bizarre smack a bitch quick
Then give her ass and lick while she take a shit
Fuck your period, fuck your rag
Take it in your ass, just like a fag
All my fans is crazy, they love it
That's why I say fuck it, and smack you in public
I'm rugged!

[Verse 2 - Reef the Lost Cauze]
Yeah, you know me well
The Gods said that they owe me hell
I'm The Outlaw Josey Wales
I make a nigga feel spiritual like holy tales
From the bible, roll Exodus and then inhale
No one knows you, so if I kill you who’d I tell?
Half-hipster, whiney nigga that’s a fuckin' fail
Life without purpose, that’s a fucking jail
Lost Cauze, when I spit it’s fucking hell

[Verse 3 - Ill Bill]
Master a dance of lesbians
Satanic majesty's equestrian
On a black steed stampeding pedestrians
'Do what thou willt' shall be the whole of the law
I get my dick sucked by a nun with the soul of a whore
Superstitious like a gypsy casting a death-spell
Exhale chem-trails
Strangle you with your own entrails
14th day of July innocence was averted
Ill Bill, born on the same day Billy The Kid was murdered

[Verse 4 - Slaine]
It's kill or be killed
So watch out for the villain - he's ill
I'm slinging rap, swinging bats like I'm in little league still
Sniffing cocaine off a coin with Kennedy's grill
Cough from a joint while I'm crushing my enemies will
I'm a homicidal Hercules, doggie, I'm an urban myth
I swerve the whip, get my dick sucked while on my work release
I give these rappers bad advice and a nervous twitch
Penetrate and innovate, a renegade, I murder shit

[Hook]
I'm a real wolf
With the Underworld flick

[Verse 5 - Celph Titled]
I ain't racist just cause I split your head to the white meat
The missing link Yeti-Sasquatch, yeah I might be
This shit's real - distribute guns in the kids meal
Open the box, hold the Glock, bust a shot through the windshield
The manifestation of evil stay alive and breathing
I'm Satan's fitness trainer, exercising demons
Respect the shooter, I'll find the bastard
Hell, my loaded pistol is a fire hazard

[Verse 6 - King Gordy]
My dick stays hard in graveyards, you pray hard
As I make love to Adolf Hitler’s carcass
Call me a nigger as I lick his heartless chest
I guess these skinhead Nazis wanna get retarded
Why? Cuz I’m fucking your leader all in his ass
Speak to him in Hebrew, fuck the Führer until he's back, dead again
Tell the Aryans I’m burying my head right in his belly
And it’s scary cause I'm licking his mustache

[Verse 7 - Sid]
Son of a killer, Mr. fucking grimey
SAS 22nd regiment limey
Born in a bar with my eyes wide open
Inspired by debacles since I came out the fallopian
We don't fuck around, got permits to carry
Everybody walks around like Dirty fucking Harry
Don't play my town, cause we will fucking bury you
Carry you to a farm cut off your arms, chewed up by animals

[Verse 8 - PMD]
On your mark, get set, ready to go
Green light, checkered flag, time to get that dough
And ayo, in the underworld I'm half-wolf and half-lycan
Swing the Excalibur, barbaric viking

[Verse 9 - Sean Strange]
Vicodin, marijuana, cocaine, the Grateful Dead
Average rapper kidnapping
Be sure to make your bed
When they battle me fatality take your head
And write a rhyme with your blood
The page's painted red

[Hook]

[Verse 10 - Apathy]
I'm the king of Castle Greyskull
My grey matter's powerful as Grey Hulk
I’m Zartan, I’m Tarzan before he went to Greystroke
My brain's broke, slang dope
And when I speak, my slang's dope
You're soft as fuck - your whole album is a gay joke
Rap's lethal, spit a sixteen at you
We'll paint the ceiling with your brains
Like the Sistine Chapel
I'm the cardinal of carnage, the poisonous priest
Don't bother praying to your God
There's no avoiding this beast

[Verse 11 - Swifty McVay]
You ain't about that life
You a bastard that won't attack
I'm the type to grab a knife
And I'm stabbing you with it backwards
I'm backslapping wack ass non-rappers
Snatch the breath out of you faster than asthma without a gas mask
I lace hash, a heinous figure
Slash-murderer, I'm burning these legacy killers
Putting mo' metal in niggas than robotic mechanisms
Kill his woman and brag about it in prison

[Verse 12 - Vinnie Paz]
Rambo-knife, show you what bloody is
You call it a dead cop, I call it a bloody pig
You think your hands nice money? You's a funny kid
You next to get molly-whopped like your buddy did
The Ruger Blackhawk, stick it in the dunny rib
Throw him in the fucking bathroom like Sunny did
The biggest show in your career; like a hundred kids
The AR-15 blew off like a hundred wigs

[Verse 13 - Tech N9ne]
Grim reaper to Ariel Castro, Adam Lanza, James Holmes
Flame on, no it ain't wrong when I'mma have them plans for cancer
Then land ya in a hands up tense panthers
Damned with antlers to ram ya man pampers
Scrams the answer, No evil understands ya
Grandeur and like you were three times the word lambda
I’ll be the damper on a clan’s fam camper
Necromancer drinking vodka and Fanta with Santa

[Hook][Hook: Block McCloud]
If anybody got a problem with me we just fight
Step up to the Gods and you'll see we just fight
I suggest you best to take it easy
This is AOTP and we'll make you believe we just fight
If anybody got a problem with me we just fight
Step up to the God degree and we will fight
I suggest you check our reputation
This is dedication or the devils may come and we will fight

[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
Listen I could never take an L
Same energy that created Heaven, created Hell
Keep your motherfucking mouth shut and just wait for bail
That's the first law of the street, you never snake and tell
Big guns, big beards, bunch of Chewbaccas
Walk up in the Tourneau and cop a few watches
So much dro in high school I needed two lockers
My Enemy Mine, my enemy Lou Gossett's
I ain't trying to listen to y'all, cause you garbage
Viktor Vasnetsov, higher when he flew carpets
Everybody make money, only few profit
Still the same Vinnie, I just got a new logic

[Verse 2: Celph Titled]
I ain't here to cut the cake (stupid)
The fuck you think the knife is for?
Criminal psychologist; ain't never seen my type before
Celph Titled: mother-fucking manager of manslaughter
I'm a mobster, shoot you if you move your hands awkward
If I'm running it's from the police
If I'm gunning it's at your dome piece
Extended barrel that's four feet
The steel mag will fold ya (fo'sho)
I think of Steel Magnolias when I see your soldiers (that's them?)
So come to the fork in the road and get a fork in your throat
No father to my style, I am the orphan of flows
Yes bitch you can get on my guest list
Just know I keep a biscuit in a bag like a McDonald's breakfast

[Verse 3: Block McCloud]
You ain't truly hard, I pull your car up the boulevard
Rob you for your jewelry in front of your groupie squad
Cause I'm a full retard
I slap you silly, tap the jelly out your capillary
Might murk you like Makaveli
The armor's on at your worst you're an accomplice
A sidekick, you ride dicks
You're like an armrest, you'll get elbowed
Kick your shit in with my Shell Toes
Shut the fuck up, yeah I'm stuck up like Velcro
You want a free hook? Hell no
You're a pussy cat, I got a douche for that
Peel your wig off and push it back
Your god flesh will hang off your skeleton when the missiles rang
Let's make an official gang, let the pistols bang

[Hook]

(Never take your eyes off your opponent)

[Verse 4: Reef the Lost Cauze]
Cause if you do you are obsolete
The .9 you see will make niggas jump like Dominique
You need to stop rapping when I'm tryna sleep
Never trust a fat dude who say he just tryna eat
And that kind is me, I smoke that kind of weed
You see a ((?)) star under the ganja leaf
The flow sweeter than grape jam
But still I smack you in your motherfucking head like Captain Caveman
And the church say "Amen"
I don't know you niggas, your name to me is "Hey, man..."
The righteous at war with Shaytan
So in one hand is my son the other 28 grams

[Verse 5: Esoteric]
E.S. the high priest coming taking them heads
Rappers popping shit on Twitter without taking their meds
I see 'em laying in bed, I can picture it now
They thumbing through their phone looking for original style
Get off your ass, rap Cialis spazzin cats get devoured
So call the doctor if it's lasting more than four hours
Open the cell, y'all focused as hell
I spit acid like the flower on the Joker's lapel
I Stand Alone, Complex like the Ghost in the Shell
You suffer from a concussion like players post NFL
So guard your grill, no trigger tracks take bigger steps
I straight body tracks like a stick figure sketch

[Verse 6: Crypt the Warchild]
Fuck you similes and metaphors, I'm just tryna settle war
I can only self destruct,  I am like the Predator
Personal vendettas now, I am out to settle scores
You don't wanna get involved, you can't walk, run or crawl
It don't rain it heavy pour, soon as the Henny pour
I don't need grimy bitches, hoodrats or Fendi whores
Nope. I had to step back but I remain sharp though
How you gonna build walls around King Marco
Love this rap shit fully but it pays partial
Got tunnel vision for the money so it strains carpals
I'm Ray Dawson with the hawk, let the spray spark you
When these sharks taste blood we never lay off you

[Verse 7: Apathy]
One inch punch, hits hard as shotgun pumps
Knock kids out they Reebok Pumps
Fucking punks walk the plank, kerplunk
Suckers sunk get slumped
Like drunk driving and crashing in tree trunks
Backstage, rap groupie sluts scheming on blunts
Bunch of bum ass bitches in some beat up Dunks
Roll that weed up cunt, tell her we'll meet up front
She kinda frumpy but she still could get her D cups humped
Every beat that we bump, means somebody got jumped
Beaten up tied his hands to his feet to bleed in the trunk
I don't understand the reason kids are feeling these chumps
I'm kinda stumped... uh duuhhhh, I can't even front
I lose a brain cell every time the 808 thump
That shit stunk, shrunk heads like a voodoo monk
A wild monkey in a cage throwing doodoo chunks
I lunge straight for the throat, blood and guts for lunch

[Hook][Intro: Vinnie Paz]
Yeah, one time, ha ha
Pharaoh clique

[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
I got no time for extra shit
I'm like a bad film editor with extra clips
You never shit where you eat unless you extra bitch
You never get no relief like I'm next to pitch
I'm on the throne, all alone where the Devil sit
Son of the Wise la-Hakim Menelik
Laugh at the unbeliever you malevolent
He only half as nice, sacrifice his sentiment
Praise be the God, he defy logical
Put me at the foul line, take two shots at you
Death life, life death so horrible
Let this motherfucking bulldog bark at you

[Verse 2: Apathy]
Jubala, Jubalo Jubalum
I'm a giant on this earth, fee-fi-fo-fum
Cerebellum over-loader make your brain stem numb
Super fans make their bitch wanna swallow my cum
You can't clash with a Pharaoh, there's nowhere to run
As quick as I put the clip in it go in the gun
Everything is slow motion, blood go in your lungs
Ridiculous as Icarus flying close to the sun
I'm a Supernova, nobody escapes my gravity
Graffiti on the moon spelling out the name Apathy
Undisputed king of the Milky Way Galaxy
I'd eat your whole squad but I got a wackness allergy
Tyrannical, over-sized cannibal
I'm the son of Samuel, murder without the manual
The tomb of King Tut pimp sluts rip guts
From opponents while I'm drinking their blood from my pimp cup

[Hook] x2
Pharaoh Clique
We bust ya shit
You know it’s no holds barred
When the bars we spit
It goes: what-what?
It goes: what-what? (Pharaohs!)
AOTP get your wig split!

[Verse 3: Celph Titled]
Times change, but my mind-frame just loves war
Ted Danson from Cheers, I'm above Norm
I exploit performers that's wack
Record raps on my phone's voice recorder app
Permanent hunchback, from keeping my city on my spine
Cause I've been making tracks since A hats and Karl Kani
Get your bitch far more wet
When I get paid, it's a fuckin' party with a giant cardboard check
The Army is a hardcore set
Paper before pussy, these haters is all rookies
I give 'em bowling ball noogies
No warning shots, mister
I empty ammo crates 'til my palms got blisters

[Verse 4: Esoteric]
Ayo, Pharaoh death blow, the violent tempo
Your so dead to me like the Pirate's retro
Found on Willie Stargell, I kill these bars well
Lift 'em like a barbell, you sound like Marcel the Shell
When you rhyme, I'm unveiled
Designed, my heart sails
De Lima Cartel, is five times bigger
The Czar melts your mind
I spit like a .9
Is that fast? I don't even know
I typically use a EE-3 Carbine Rifle that Boba Fett shoot
Execute rappers underwater, tie a wire to their wet-suit
Barracudas eat 'em, we don't need 'em
We beat 'em, then we bleed 'em out
Trash 'em and delete 'em

[Verse 5: Reef The Lost Cauze]
Taste the beast, I'm a motherfuckin' Minotaur
Catch a hot flash like an old broad with menopause
AOTP clique, those been my dogs
You don't believe in me? You can't believe there is a God
You must be an Atheist
They don't ever try and test me, I must be the craziest
You ain't make a move yet? You must be the laziest
Your team is shook, and I bet you the shakiest
I split your head to the white meat
The gun's roar so fuckin' loud, you'd think that it was Bike Week
I'm from Philly, where the cost of life cheap
50 bones get you gone by Ricans down Pike Street
I'm not a blog creation, I'm not a hype beast
I am the embodiment of dope rhymes and a right beat
I am the result of Scarface and Ice-T
Tan trees, white tees, my niggas think just like me
I'm nice G

[Hook] 2x

[Reef The Lost Cauze]
AOTP raw rap forever![Hook: Block McCloud]
Laugh now, cry later as you look at the sun
If you live by the sword, you’ll probably die by the gun
Laugh now, cry later, why you hanging your head?
Plenty of time to answer to the angel of death

[Verse 1: Block McCloud]
I'm the prince of darkness, reign over the kingdom of disaster
Rhythm get smashed, fucked, like the children of a pastor
Nigga, I'm bad luck, I'm misery, I'm your master
Making you hang it up, like folks living in Alaska
I'm radiant, summer blinded, by the sun divine Damian
In the front lines of Egypt, with the blood line of an alien
I'm so defiant, the stone that broke Goliath's dome
Flow tyrant, hold the belt of Orion, I strode with giants
The globetrotter, spit Goldschläger and molt' lava
The old father of flows, there's no one that goes harder
I'm the Al-Qaeda style writer, death's an inspirador
A life of behind these walls, get caught in my lines of fire
And expire, I'm the devil's pitchfork in the road
I'll torture your soul, 'til you sell it for a fortune of gold
The fortunes foretold, we all die, so live life to the fullest
Live by the gun, die by the bullet, by the knife slicing your gullet
Pharaoh

[Verse 2: Crypt the Warchild]
Too blind to see the light, I envision blackness
Live by the bloody hatchet, die from the dusty ratchet
Back from the lake of fire, with my halo broken
They want reality so I give 'em a fatal dosage
Niggas acting real savage, but I barely notice
I'm headhunting, so I ain't trying to lose my focus
We the murderers, murderous, call the coroners
Tell them to stop recording us...
No more hope in 'em, box cutter open 'em
This is uncut opium, for you to put your nose up in
Got em overdosing, head-swelling, comatosing
Overseas, so I'm posting bodies floating in the ocean
Pharaoh

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Reef the Lost Cauze]
Don't be trusting in these rappers, look how poorly they acting
Only seen guns bust in Civil War reenactments
Yeah we all took that class trip to Harrisburg or Gettysburg
So spare your words before you get embarrassed nerd
Waiting for the day I'm catching you
You can have MMA fighters protecting you, pussy I'm still wrecking you
Your idol, the one you wish you could perform like
Drop classic albums, you can't even get one song right
A couple songs tight, but not cause you speaking on 'em
It's cause the beat was banging and had dope features on it
It's Reefer on it, you got a rat's spine, a chicken's heart
And a weasel's stomach, what are you?
You little hog you, you fucking pig
I split your wig, so what you on kid?
Dope or dog food?
This ain't a warning, this a promise boy
Cause I'm your motherfucking daddy, and I won't raise a mama's boy

[Verse 4: Vinnie Paz]
Yeah my family hate you, we wilding
I was chilling, but then y'all propagated the problem
Let it wash over you, let you pray to the lion
If the father disrespect me, the baby is dying
Whats gon' happen when the inmates raid the asylum?
It ain't one of you motherfuckers crazy as I am
Killing you stupid motherfuckers is fish in the barrel
High priest of every temple, I am a Pharaoh
Crypt the Warchild, the bow, I am the arrow
I get under you skin, Lord, I am the marrow
We could go gun for gun, battle for battle
We could go son for son, mine is a Pharaoh

[Hook x2][INTRO]

[Celph Titled]

Yeah! It's the God Damned Army
Fuck you thought! Celph Titled, Planetary, Demoz, Reef the Lost Motherfucking Cauze, the Esoterodactyl. You a fool for this beat Eso, but right about now, Chief Kamachi, split their motherfucking head open

[Chief Kamachi]

Yo the Pharaohs back, less than an hour's nap
Woke up in a cave on the top of Mount Arafat
Blood on the tarot pack, apparel black
Street mystic get you twisted with your barrel packed
119 they blamed it on some Arab cat
I meditated, and left two towers flat
With the whole section 8 Egyptian power rap
Little spump, sparkling bump, no spiritual
Don't let me start with the pump, pecked
Faggot preacher pluck a heart for the punk
I got a passion for putting bloody parts in a trunk
It's The Messiah, never been a musical kump

[Demoz]

The Colosseum fiending, screaming "Demoz!"
They could see the pour-up from Europe to Lehigh
When they see I'm coming they running I keep nine
Shots for they stomach and face, eat five!
Never will I run from a case like a cheap guy
If I can't afford the lawyer, I'll burn him like deep fry
Undeveloped faggot, I'm classic like Levi's
Rap marathon, I passed them like three times
Take my rap skills multiply by three times
All it takes from my verse to defeat him is three lines
Peep my battle ability weak guy
If I can't walk over you nigga I leap high
Shoot looking down when I pass, you scream "Why?"
You bit my whole style with no teeth I reply...
You walking on glass barefooted, my sneaks tied
Talking out your ass when you shouldn't you speak lies

[Planetary]

Yo
Whenever I say so we full court pressing 'em
Handle the rock and cross over like the rest of 'em
Who got the ratchet? I crack the pendulum
My adrenaline race the pace you trembling
My regiment take shots of bad medicine
Extinguish the game like distinguished gentlemen
Severus so far the best with the pen again
Venomous ink, paint the picture so elegant
Elevate my state, I'm high like a pelican
Powerful punchlines puncture through your skeleton
Space niggas erase niggas irrelevant
Post-up prevalent, in my development
I make the case, so the dope can settle in
"Paz, there's no goose!" so we threw the kettle in
Pharaohs amongst the king of this tenement
You demand sin, and get the pen, and Cryp, "Send 'em in!"

[Esoteric]

Mind bender, line sender
Time ender, Pharaoh front line member
The mic's a divine ember burning you
The blood doesn't trickle, it sprays
I'm like The young Nikita Koloff with the sickle when im stripped in the page
For centuries, held down bars like penitentiaries
You entertain, it's funny like Kevin James
Now stay in your fucking Lane like Clark Kent, you get it man?
Hip-hop's deader than Vince Lombardi
It's full of wine and crackers like your wife's dinner parties
I'm a Pharaoh, swords drawn for battle
Running with apes like Ann Darrow
Reef!

[Reef the Lost Cauze]

I ain't wit this rap shit dog, I literally kill em
Put the Colt 45 to your lips like Billie Dee Williams
It works every time, I murk every line
It never gets easier, it hurts every time
I been the best, I got kids on the Internet
Seeking my approval like they send a fucking friend request
Uh..Denied, Go, fuck your life
I crump-up your head, and up-chuck your rhymes
Barf, you know vomit and such
You got no fans so you claim being popular sucks
That's called hating, your brain is all vacant
I'd never sit down and eat with y'all, it's all bacon

[Celph Titled]

Demons and gargoyles, lions and wizards
We leaving 'em hard-boiled and frying they gizzards
That's what Celph Titled rhyming will get ya
Act like a bitch guy and get stabbed in the eye with my scissors
Rap super-star for now, hip-hop legend for later
Leave a treacherous crater with a push of this detonator
So who's ill and who's not? Who's popping and ooh-wop
Who's a cross between El Chupacabra and 2Pac?
(Well, who else but you Celph?) No sandals on my shoe shelf
Just a pellet gun leave a huge welt
Army of the Pharaohs never make love songs
We finger fuck bitches with Freddy Krueger gloves on[Verse One] [King Magnetic]:
I stick out like a pistol on a skinny person
When it’s urgent get punched more times than Vinnie verses
I’m a problem from the product to the paperwork
Slave deal make it work, main concern is making earnings
Got a great attorney, got me in the streets now
Ultramagnetic
Critical Beatdown
Invincible beast now
Invisible beat burst, street slang, feet first
Teeth marks Reef’s merch
It’s enticing reversal, the type that’ll burst you
The rifle will Earth you, put a knife in your hurdle
Pipe in your girdle, I’ll stick the fucking mic in the fertile
Keep it a secret until she sneak the creeping immortal
In order to keep me you outta, read the disorder
At least we can afford the quarter of the reefer they brought us
Give me a warrant so your image won’t last long
You suspect like armed robbers with no mask on

[Hook]:
Anyone above us, time to plummet now
Cause we always sound hungry as a stomach growl
While you run your mouth, my nigga’s run it now
Till our verses is fucking up your budget now

[Verse Two] [Reef The Lost Cauze]:
I’m a serious beast, you’re a delirious queef
The bacteria found in traces of period yeast
Seriously, fear is envy
You’re frail and you sell fairy tales like a mirror that’s me
Who’s the fairest? I bought you niggas, who’s your parents?
You repeat what your boss say, you’s the parrot
God bless all the fools who perish
Trying to remove the cherished kids who lose the spirit
Lift you like air lifts, I’m in tune with spiritual damage, you ?
Stop it, stab em, pop it, tag em, drop em, I track em
And snatch em in flat lands, they’ll find your fat hands
Stashed inside of a fucking trash can
Niggas stink like Pepe Le Pew, especially you
Me and Mag reppin' for Stoupe
I’m next to get due so to respect me is due
Dawg I shot the sheriff and the deputy too

[Hook]:
Anyone above us, time to plummet now
Cause we always sound hungry as a stomach growl
While you run your mouth, my nigga’s run it now
Till our verses is fucking up your budget now
Anyone above us, time to plummet now
Cause we always sound hungry as a stomach growl
While you run your mouth, my nigga’s run it now
Till our verses is fucking up your budget now

[Verse Three] [Reef The Lost Cauze]:
I am felt from Philly to the Bible Belt
A champion who smoke weed like Michael Phelps
If my words don’t do it then my rifle help
You nice and all that homie but don’t hype yourself
Thinking you can creep in and just swipe the belt
Don’t blame God, you ain’t strike yourself
Catch a hook like a new chorus
It’s not about what the music does for you
What can you do for it?

[King Magnetic]:
I quit Newports, I borrow a cig now
The same caliber of the shit that’s a big now
Beast that’s compared to deceased in they region
Get open with a stick like my blinds Venetian
Crimes is recent, the rhymes I’m leasing
Define my reason I’m squeezing the nine, police em
Didn’t think you'd be an artist soon, I call this tune
"Cop King And The Cauze In June"

[Hook]:
Anyone above us, time to plummet now
Cause we always sound hungry as a stomach growl
While you run your mouth, my nigga’s run it now
Till our verses is fucking up your budget nowBring the light to the dark, AOTP, yeah

[Verse 1: Reef the Lost Cauze]
I Self, Lord and Master
I'm not a rapper
The industry been in a nigga pockets, since Napster
So me explainin' why I'm still grinding, I don't have to
I'd sell my masters, if the cash come
Cause my girl need a new car and baby need Pampers
It's real shit, y'all never know about it ask us
Side jobs in retail, detail cars and ride trash trucks
Never complain, we never had much
The ends won't justify the means, it don't add up
Rap, work, and sell dope, now that's a mash-up
Kids say they wanna do this? I just crack up
I tell em stay in school, fool, you need a backup

[Verse 2: Doap Nixon]
Aye-o I'm blowin' brown every day to keep the stress down
And niggas that I seem to let 'round, they always let down
So I'm building a bunch of young niggas like Brett Brown
They all ballers, keeping niggas in check so when I
Big up my set I'm paying homage to Pharaohs
And when you hear me spit, acknowledge my vowels
It's probably foul
I never change the language for change
It's slang written
Half my life gambling heists to keep that thing with 'em
Suplex mangler, but it's a cold word baby
So I'm a North Face and Cumberland whore chasin'
So knuckle up or get cutted up
Or smacked with the butt of the gun, buttercup
For trying to fuck with us
Who dumb enough to try one of us?
We peelin' your girl off the grill of a Hummer truck, when the sun come up
Who one of us? Raise your face to the skies
And watch the mortals make way for the return of the Gods
Pharaohs

[Hook] [x2]
AOTP cock the latch back clack clack
OPG got the straps in the back pack
Bodies in the trunk of the '96 hatch-back
Punch you in the face, slap your man out his snap back

[Verse 3: Blacastan]
I'm John Allen Muhammad living out of a van
Picking off bystanders with a rifle in hand
I'm demented, I'm a couple cards short of a full deck
I'm a liar, I'm the charismatic man in a pulpit
I'm AOTP, Demigods, JMT
A faith healer, healing through death on CD
I am not a role model, you should raise your own kids (come on)
I'm a dirty rap nigga with fruit flies in my crib
I'm strange, I'm deranged, I'm fascinated with death
I chain smoke cigarettes, I got terrible breath
The show's almost over, only two songs left
So cop a T-shirt, find the exit and step nigga

[Verse 4: Demoz]
Aye-o fuck being a good person
I'm in the hood workin'
Smoking shit to numb my pain
I don't know if you could nurse him
Doctors can't figure out what to do with him
Once upon a time, he used to have screws in him
Now Lucifer let loose in me
They not used to me
I'm not what I used to be
I used to be a young nigga, silly state of mind
Now I'm just a nigga going crazy like he facing time (uhh)
I'm from the hood where the young die
If you don't lay low, you get hung high
Nigga I lay low, and still hang high
In my head, shit only hit the fan when your man die
I take a sip of this liquor inspired with hearses
Nobody surviving, I smoke my weed out of Bible verses
Inspire churches to sin, what?
I inspire churches to bring niggas like me in, clear of my sins but

[Verse 5: Vinnie Paz]
Why would you ever try to be god with me?
Why would you bother me, why don't you ever see prophecy?
Possibly honestly, Sodom, Gomorrah atrocity
Mephistopheles at the door to door, a monopoly
Why would you lie to me? Why would you see the Allah in me?
Am I the only one who see comedy in monogamy?
I lay back, eat mozzarella and sliced swordfish
Put my feet up on the table in my nice office
Black mask, black millimeter, white Porsches
Every single rhyme Vinnie write, type gorgeous

Hahahahaha listen, Pistolero Pazzie

[Hook x2][Verse 1: Apathy]
Yo I’m a bastard, the after-effect of passionate sex
I came out the bassinette blasting a TEC
Look out your window, see Ap passing your jet
With Superman in a headlock and a gat to his neck
Fuck kryptonite, picture bloods and crips on Krypton
Superhuman powers, a cape with house slippers on
I kept it real, money’s never my Achilles heel
I’m like Cliff Lee going for the Phillies deal

[Verse 2: Esoteric]
I’m a rebel with mics, I’m Daredevil with sight
I can be the peacemaker, I can set off the fight
Don’t provoke us, fuck around and get your death notice
I’m just trying to raise awareness, I ain’t talking about Chef’s focus
I’m like a combination of George and Frank Lucas
You you’re LUCAS, you catch locusts, eat mucus
So don’t you ever step, never rep, you will never get better
So get clever and drop the motherfucking mic forever

[Verse 3: Blacastan]
Step inna di dance, wit’ a splif of sensi
Running with them boys called DGZ
AOTP performing and they ain’t no joke
Fuck around and get your scrawny pencil neck broke
I’m a criminal, rain dance on you like a Seminole
Shitstorm your label flipping over tables
Professor X out of the chair, fully able
Wolverine up in the booth slicing your cables

[Verse 4: Reef the Lost Cauze]
This my kind of beat, the body will feel it, the mind is weak
So I slam bodies like Iron Sheik
This is hustle music nigga, we grind and eat
Fuck a hater, feel this razor that’s inside my sneaks
My brother Ap blap blap this is Honkey talk
The flow is tighter than how a fucking honkey walk
This junkyard calls, call a Coroner
Undertake you, break you, the ultimate warrior

[Verse 5: Planetary]
Yeah million dollar man, Ted DiBiase shit
Ralph Macchio flow winning like Karate Kid
Miyagi when I politic, Obama with the Poligrip
Mad at the world, every verse I gotta body shit
Ric Flair silver-haired nigga getting old yo
Army of the Pharaoh clique, the rest of y’all are so-so
Me and Crypt are like the legion of doom
You can’t defeat us and we putting non believers in tombs

[Verse 6: Crypt the Warchild]
Murderous arrangement using words to just play with
Guilty by association at my arraignment
Nightcrawler, knife brawler, fight harder
Pipe drawl if I’m dead I’m a mic martyr
Puerto rock, know how to spit, that’s undisputed
AOTP, we dirty, we ghetto, we zooted
We get gully, grime pays and y’all peddle y’all music
You got a new album, nobody listening to it

[Verse 7: Motive]
My appetite is Galactus like, eating satellites
A iceberg Cyclops will freeze the blast of light
When this bastard writes it mics the afterlife
F with us, I check niggas like the answers right
I ain’t the type to walk around with my pants all tight
I love white women but live a Black Panther’s life
This Demigod get the job done effortless
Got 'em waiting on the kid to drop like a pregnant bitch

[Verse 8: Celph Titled]
I ain’t from this planet, your human rap skills are just lukewarm
I got alien intestines like the ones that kept Luke warm
Angering actors, action-packed factoring
Factions in Anchorage, Alaska waving an axe at you
(Who want it?)
My unfortunate Orthodontist astonished
That I had Cobra’s teeth, I bit him in his shoulder meat
All’s fair, I floss yeah the Boss here
Won’t keep you in my prayers but I’ll keep you in my crosshairs

[Verse 9: Vinnie Paz]
Vinnie van-hammer, Paz hit you with the blam blammer
Get my money on the street like a panhandler
American me motherfucking Santana
Rock more polo shit than a Cam stanza
Y’all are Kanye, sweeter than a canned Fanta
Allahu Akbar Lord I’m Iran’s chancellor
There’s blood dripping from my mouth like a tanned panther
I’m the motherfucking boss like the man Danza[Hook: Block McCloud]
Laugh now, cry later as you look at the sun
If you live by the sword, you’ll probably die by the gun
Laugh now, cry later, why you hanging your head?
Plenty of time to answer to the angel of death

[Verse 1: Block McCloud]
I'm the prince of darkness, reign over the kingdom of disaster
Rhythm get smashed, fucked, like the children of a pastor
Nigga, I'm bad luck, I'm misery, I'm your master
Making you hang it up, like folks living in Alaska
I'm radiant, summer blinded, by the sun divine Damian
In the front lines of Egypt, with the blood line of an alien
I'm so defiant, the stone that broke Goliath's dome
Flow tyrant, hold the belt of Orion, I strode with giants
The globetrotter, spit Goldschläger and molt' lava
The old father of flows, there's no one that goes harder
I'm the Al-Qaeda style writer, death's an inspirador
A life of behind these walls, get caught in my lines of fire
And expire, I'm the devil's pitchfork in the road
I'll torture your soul, 'til you sell it for a fortune of gold
The fortunes foretold, we all die, so live life to the fullest
Live by the gun, die by the bullet, by the knife slicing your gullet
Pharaoh

[Verse 2: Crypt the Warchild]
Too blind to see the light, I envision blackness
Live by the bloody hatchet, die from the dusty ratchet
Back from the lake of fire, with my halo broken
They want reality so I give 'em a fatal dosage
Niggas acting real savage, but I barely notice
I'm headhunting, so I ain't trying to lose my focus
We the murderers, murderous, call the coroners
Tell them to stop recording us...
No more hope in 'em, box cutter open 'em
This is uncut opium, for you to put your nose up in
Got em overdosing, head-swelling, comatosing
Overseas, so I'm posting bodies floating in the ocean
Pharaoh

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Reef the Lost Cauze]
Don't be trusting in these rappers, look how poorly they acting
Only seen guns bust in Civil War reenactments
Yeah we all took that class trip to Harrisburg or Gettysburg
So spare your words before you get embarrassed nerd
Waiting for the day I'm catching you
You can have MMA fighters protecting you, pussy I'm still wrecking you
Your idol, the one you wish you could perform like
Drop classic albums, you can't even get one song right
A couple songs tight, but not cause you speaking on 'em
It's cause the beat was banging and had dope features on it
It's Reefer on it, you got a rat's spine, a chicken's heart
And a weasel's stomach, what are you?
You little hog you, you fucking pig
I split your wig, so what you on kid?
Dope or dog food?
This ain't a warning, this a promise boy
Cause I'm your motherfucking daddy, and I won't raise a mama's boy

[Verse 4: Vinnie Paz]
Yeah my family hate you, we wilding
I was chilling, but then y'all propagated the problem
Let it wash over you, let you pray to the lion
If the father disrespect me, the baby is dying
Whats gon' happen when the inmates raid the asylum?
It ain't one of you motherfuckers crazy as I am
Killing you stupid motherfuckers is fish in the barrel
High priest of every temple, I am a Pharaoh
Crypt the Warchild, the bow, I am the arrow
I get under you skin, Lord, I am the marrow
We could go gun for gun, battle for battle
We could go son for son, mine is a Pharaoh

[Hook x2][Intro]:
Hello. And welcome to, A Vicious Cycle. Please, enjoy the music...but what ever you do...

[Hook]:
Don't call it a comeback
"We back at it again"
Don't call it a comeback
"We back at it again"
Don't call it a comeback
"We back at it again"
Don't call it a comeback
"We back at it again"

[Verse One]:
Ayo it's Reef The Lost Cauze, whoopdediwoo
Half man, half animal, Zoobilee Zoo
People often stop me when I'm maneuverin' through
Sayin', "Hold it down for Philly like you usually do."
I reply, "Ya damn skippy." I am 50
Before he got shot, these pussies just can't hit me
I'm the equivalence of ridiculous
You know who I am, you are all witnesses
The son of Jor El with a gun and a el
From where the winters is cold and the summers is hell
Old vultures and young birds with somethin' to sell
If not, waitin' to rob you under the L
Dear America, you motherfuckers have failed
Cause a nigga either die in the street or suffer in jail
There's no in-between, unless you gettin' green
Ain't no inheritance from my heritage, so by any means
Reef is back

[Hook]:
Don't call it a comeback
"We back at it again"
Don't call it a comeback
"We back at it again"
Don't call it a comeback
"We back at it again"
Don't call it a comeback
"We back at it again"

[Verse Two]:
I got a girl that loves me, a girl that don't respect me
My black joint Shaneeka, my white joint Becky
An A&R told me, I wasn't ready
He now works at Burger King, "I'll have a Pepsi."
With my meal, labels make me sign waivers with my deal
That I won't get my steel
And run up in the office like, "Fuck you pay me."
I started my own label, Fuck You Pay Me
Y'all been hemmin' and hawwin', I've been sittin' and thawin'
But I'm back in this bitch, kickin' and clawin'
? is drawn, don't fuck up my zone, come to your home
Pop you while I rock the suit like Brother Mouzone
I'm the brother, who pulled another sword from the stone
You flip burgers, I cop Jordan's in Rome
Eyego's a legend
That's the boy to me
You don't want beats from him? Fuck it just means more for me
And we

[Hook]:
Don't call it a comeback
"We back at it again"
Don't call it a comeback
"We back at it again"
Don't call it a comeback
"We back at it again"
Don't call it a comeback
"We back at it again"'Machi, Lost Cauze, [Syfe Law?], Charon Don
Let's get it on, it's Juju Mob motherfuckers

[Verse 1: Reef The Lost Cauze]
Yo, imagine if the Prince of Darkness
Fathered a four-headed monster
And sent it to conquer the black market
And after the slaughter the monster grew stronger
Broke free from the chains, held in hell no longer
Lost Cauze: a wild dog with a passionate bite
So vividly brutal like 'The Passion Of Christ'
Kamachi snatching your mic, Charon tear off your fucking arm
And pass it to Syfe like we passing a pipe
Make smoke slip from your bones just from listening to poems
And when I walk you hear the theme music from 'The Omen'
Arabian Damien’s maiming men, and when my razor bend
It’ll do more than chafe your skin, dog I play to win
This is the team to beat, my money’s on the Mob
The jig is up, your squad is a facade
Y’all are nothing special, I'll fucking stretch you
You’ll have to wear a mask for the rest of your life like MF Doom
What?!

[Verse 2: State Store?]
To the black of dawn I’ma send it out in rapping form
I’m from a shabby home where I created the greatest
Of a written over ritual paper, I’m with getting money priests
That'll sell you [leakies?] and free beats, now
Please don’t speak, just lose your turn
Or you’re gonna lose your soul, I'll curse your ass
[?]
That’s the crib where you live, I'll leave it lying in ashes
In front of your eyes your life flashes
The sun'll rise covered in a ski mask
You're praying so much you need knee pads
Your teeth chatter, but ain’t no coming back from this
This like getting your wrists slit, you can feel this shit
Bumping your body like blackheads
'Til my pockets thicker than fat kids
It’s all for the love of the crafty rapping
Meaning I’ma earn my earnings
From issuing out some of the most burning sermons

[Verse 3: Charon the Don]
Yo, peep the Don, I’m nothing to sleep on so keep on
You the type niggas beat and pull the heat on
When we speak you would think we put the heat on
We about to unleash the beast and leave a piece gone
It’s the Mob, a family of gods
Street calamities, no fantasy, my sanity’s lost
To the fans slashing gravity and tragedy, pause
I still got the ladies handing me their panties and drawers
That’s vanity y’all, no, you can’t manage me dog
Every death’s another step up the ladder we fall
The masters of war, civilization, my job’s to spit for the nation
My clique’s so slick we slip through the pavement
And we spit for amazement, so be amazed or be afraid
It’s history in the making, it’s poetry in flame
So talk reckless and feel the Glock’ll spit
The new apocalypse, ain’t nobody stopping this

[Verse 4: Chief Kamachi]
Feel the spirit of the only black messiah in the room
That slang nickel bags of swag and ?
From the cocaine capsule boom to astral zoom
Have street scientific tombs, kingly hieroglyphic tombs
It’s silk Moorish pantaloons
I stay spiffy, queens screaming, too mystical for me
The glow from my Tut jewelry put that pimp aura on it
I am the fire of a goon in a Yoruba story
K-a-m-a-c-h-i, supreme oratory
Juju talk, scattered priests right with voodoo talk
My voice is a dark road that very few will walk
And these words is gold and your stereo's a vault
I hit 'em from on high like an aerial assault
Damn baby, I beat 'em to a beautiful pulp
So bring the flowers and book
And burn a million black candles for my murderous talk[Hook: Reef the Lost Cauze] (x2)
This is Black Ops, I ain't talking about Xbox
This is war with drugs and gangs and black cops
Watch your back or end up with your back shot
In Philly it feels like we playing a game of Black Ops

[Verse 1]
Gun shots burst and hit a fiend, your enemy's curses
Many things are not guaranteed but death is certain
In the bushes in all black is an insurgent
Strapped with a bomb to his person waiting to hurt shit
The street level surface is filled with workers goin' shirtless
Trained in the weapons of torture
And the oppressed just live with it
It sounds like Iraq or maybe a Palestinian village but
If you change just a few details you see Hell
It's in the same streets that we dwell
Where they hardly spar, they get their arms to call?
Mask on like Mardi Gras and leave you harshly scarred
It is God we call from when there's no answer it's arms we draw
Hit a house from the dogs of war, this the place where you meet death
You can't stop the game, there's no reset

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Revolution in the hour of black steel, raps filled
With the plague attack from the black hills
Storming the Bastille with a bat to smack grills
Selling sex, death, guns, crack, pills, your last meal
All that's up for grabs, cops with batons
Got their foot all up your ass
Hear the blast when that thing crash up the ave
It's just a game, no winners, we all come in last
Helicopters in the hood to remind us Hell's upon us
The light shines in the manhunt the hood Osamas
And their baby mamas hiding hoping they don't find them
But the black Black Ops swarmed on em like piranhas
There's no glory to be found, no honour
Kill or be killed or beg for mercy from your honour
It's sad fam but the facts stand
It ain't too difference for an American black man or a brother who's Afghan

[Hook][Intro]
Have you ever heard the legend of the Boxcutter Samurai?
He was a great warrior

[Verse 1]
On the real none more alive than this
Just a rhyme with this
Your gonna need survival kits
Beat the flow and how live it is
Your team is all turkeys like [?]
Our sum is wild, y'all can't handle sun like Irish kids
You ain't never heard this type of shit
I spit on types of plague and viruses
I don't know what style it's in
Or what a stylus is
I just huff and puff and turn your house into a pile of bricks
Dialysis surrounded by heavy hate
You're testing fate
You die laughing like Chevy Chase
Wait, No way, no weight but it's got heavy bass/base
CBC we got heavyweights in every state
See me coming mean it's time to go
The lost cauze make you see stars like kaleidoscope
You must be high on dope
I don't even know how you grieve with so many dicks lodged inside your dome
It's the boxcutter samurai

[Hook]
Samples

[Verse 2]
Smoke a glassy bowl
On the grassy knoll
Me and my man make classics like Abbey Road
I'm the baddest 'fro
I'll be gladly known as a nasty foe 'til I'm paid like Daddy Knowles
Word to Solange I bomb, I'm Pompeii
Three stacks like Andre, rap beyond gay
I bring that masculinity back
This, that, evaporate into raw energy rap
Keep the town wet
With spit that ain't reach the ground yet
[?] it's two legs and ran in fear of my sound check
Disgusting like a hound's breath, after he found flesh
Blood spews from pews
When I'm found dressed in the sharpest threads
I'm off my meds and you're marked for dead
Wearing dicks across your head
Wearing [?] as a skirt
You're a fucking jerk
Get your mother merced
Like she's a shuttleworth[?]
The boxcutter Samurai

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yeah. It's a lock cos I hold the key
Who you supposed to be?
The gold[?] MC?
To outdope MCs
Leave 'em holding like rosarys
Holds[?] a ring around the face so you won't know it's me
The game was taught rather than sold to me by the oldest G's
Who sell coke and love they kids and hold their toasters squeezed
Hurt in their eyes and scars on the back of their hands
Back to the bar playing cards with cigars in their hands
And inhale wisdom
And blow back a swarm of locusts
Man I'm focused
Stay well lit like royal oak is[?]
Be the opus
Snowgoons beats is focused
Animal in it to commit acts atrocious
FBI got posters and photos of my soldiers
Inside of black folders, trying to fool us
But we remain wizards that's cloakless
Open razor, black roses, to rap for Moses
The Samurai

[Outro]
Samples[Hook]:
I'm breaking the chains
I'm breaking the chains
I'mma do me, y'all can sit and complain
Cause all I got in this world is my balls and my word
My family and my name
I'm breaking the chains
I'm breaking the chains
I'mma do me, y'all can sit and complain
Cause all I got in this world is my balls and my word
My family and my name
I'm breaking the chains

[Verse One]:
I ain't never felt freer
I doubted my God but he made me a believer
But he ain't put me through Hell, he put me somewhere deeper
A river of shit somehow came out cleaner
You can see it when you gaze my demeanor
Born not to follow I was made from leaders
Cut from a cloth that's been burned and banished
So I'm in the cotton fields till the seeds are replanted
And I'mma sew a new cloth that expands the planet
Pieces of a canvas filled from my point of vantage
Been overlooked, misled and mismanaged
Been left for dead, so called friends up and vanished
Things went wrong I gave myself to blame
Truly a lost cause gave myself the name
But just like mighty Kong and them runaway slaves
I freed myself from the bullshit, I'm breaking the chain

[Hook] [Sample of 'Don't Move' by Phantogram]:
I'm not your nervous feeling
Each time we say goodnight
You picture buildings burning to the ground
From a basement in the streetlight
(I'm breaking the chains)
I'm not your drinking problem
A hole is in the sky
(I'm breaking the chains)
It's not your heart that you've been thinking of
Just the feeling like you're gonna die

[Reef]
I'm breaking the chains
I'm breaking the chains
I'mma do me, y'all can sit and complain
Cause all I got in this world is my balls and my word
My family and my name
I'm breaking the chains
I'm breaking the chains
I'mma do me, y'all can sit and complain
Cause all I got in this world is my balls and my word
My family and my name
I'm breaking the chains

[Verse Two]
I ain't never felt freer
I doubted my God but he made me a believer
But he ain't put me through Hell, he put me somewhere deeper
A river of shit somehow came out cleaner
Like Andy Dufresne
My arms to the sky as I stand in the rain
The chains placed around my art
Is like puttin' a cage around my heart
It gets dark
There's no spark, there's no thought, there's no lyrics
There's no hook, there's no arc
No bridge for me to come across
Cause I'm afraid if I switch it up, it won't come across
Well that's your loss
If you need me to be
Somebody I was seven years ago, that's weak
No matter what I do or say, yo that's Reef
I'll still rock your jaw, don't get fooled by the feet
I'm free

[Singing}
I'm not your fortune teller
(I'm breaking the chain)
I'm not your spinning head
(I'm breaking the chain)
I'll never make you uncomfortable too
This is starting to fuck with my head

[Verse Three]:
Respect the growth and know that MCing is a respected oath
In which I can only be described as dope
I won't be binded by any chains or ropes
I'm reachin' my full scope it's not a fuckin' joke
Trust me
I take it very seriously within this industry
So take whatever misconceptions
Or what directions you think I'm gonna go next in
Cause you can't plan the path of aggression

[Hook]:
I'm breaking the chains
I'mma do me, y'all can sit and complain
Cause all I got in this world is my balls and my word
My family and my name
I'm breaking the chains
I'm breaking the chains
I'mma do me, y'all can sit and complain
Cause all I got in this world is my balls and my word
My family and my name
I'm breaking the chains {X16}

All you know how to do is shake shake
Keep your body still

All you do is shake shake shake
Keep your body still

Stupid motherfuckers. Run, duck, and hide, die motherfucker die
(Let em know, Celph) It's time to bust some heads in. (Let's go.) Oh yeah
It is the Army. Blaaaat!

[Hook: Celph Titled]
Hard to the motherfucking core we are
The federated army of the Pharaoh murderer squad
Run run
We gonna tear the head piece up
Uh huh, you don't want beef because

Vinnie I had enough of them, yo bust 'em in
Vinnie I had enough of them, yo bust 'em in
Bust, bust 'em in
Bust, bust 'em in
Bust, bust 'em in
Bust, bust 'em in

[Verse 1: Reef The Lost Cauze]
A.O.T.P
Fresh Nikes and ice links
You won't feel till after the punch like a spiked drink
Sipping Goose till my eyes pink
Ninety-five live rings
Real niggas survive things and die kings
I can hear dead homie sayin' "Yo you owe it to me."
So it's no holds barred like the old Hulk Hogan movie
You got a heart homeboy? Well yo show it to me
The flow's majestic, I spit a roll of golden rubies
I'm old school like roll a doobie
Daddy-O my hoes is groovy, pay my rent with dough from groupies
A pimp and a killer, gorilla your project
Nine milli really only defense of my logic
The shotgun just sits in the closet
Waiting for you fuckers to come dip in my shit
Nonsense
The weak could never stop the thorough
Bitch niggas suspect, I call them boys Gossip Girls

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Apathy]
I treat fools like bitches cause I always got a few biscuits
And bus(t) 'em in like kids from different school districts
Y'all dip shits will get your spinal discs flipped
Rhymes will make the vinyl disc skip, find your wrists slit
Nickel-plated nine shine like diamonds on Slick Rick
I'm wicked as a Wiccan bitch when the candle wick's lit
Want to sample this shit? You need to read Sanskrit
And travel to the top of Mount Sinai to transmit
Running through the Red Seas like an escaped slave
Then holding up the walls of water with my sound waves
Like what I was doing during Public Execution
Half-human, half-mutant, Ap must be the Rasputin
Gats shooting, shots ricocheting off of my steel body
And three quarter length Fat Goose to conceal shotties
If God walks the surface of the sun it won't melt feet
Cause when's the last time you heard Ap rip a Celph beat?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Celph Titled]
I'm a five-star general, the motherfucking main man
Flip a bird, hold a swammy with the same hand
And do a rain dance when blood splatters and sprays
Cement mixing your IV, turn your Anatomy Grey
Nobody ratted at A-
O.T.P. Not Treach with O.P.P
I'm obsessed with O.C.D
A temperamental mental patient
With cyberkenetic on-board computer integration
One of rap's most innovative voices and flows
In front of missile-command buttons
I look around, all my choices just blow
So now you should know
I'm the don of braggadocio flamethrowing
I'm Cobra Kai and I'm keeping that dojo name going
Come down and sign up, I'm training soldiers to rhyme rough
And get they punchlines up
Cause you ain't fucking with the gold beard Rubix Cuban nowhere
No rapper is nowhere near what I just wrote here
Oh yeah

[Outro: Vinnie Paz]
Yeah. A.O.T.P. Pharaoh clique. Philly to Beantown
To Connecticut. To fuckin' Tampa. We worldwide baby
Official pistol gang. Braaaat![Verse One]
Eardrums I smash you
You're lookin' at a natural
That's word to your mother, father, Peter, Paul and Matthew
And any asshole that wanna tassel
Reef will eat 'em up and hok-ppf like a motherfuckin' cashew
I belong in a rap zoo
With a sign that reads, "Please, don't feed the angry black dude"
Cause that's when he snaps dude
Grabs poop and starts throwin' it
I'm just a gorilla who learn to flow and shit
I can be so inappropriate
But in the next bar spit a phrase that's deep as the ocean get
You hope I quit, [?]
I'll beat you to a pulp and use your body as a mop to sop up the blood
I'm very nice
In every fight, Reggie White
You Aikman, I pop your body like you was tryin' to break dance
Rhyme WildStyle
Been doin' this for awhile now
Spit razors that be so blazin' they singe your fuckin' eyebrow
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
I'm not trying to get the world to change
Just get your girl to slurp my mayne
I'm Hercules droppin' guillotines on you Mini-Mes
You need to freeze, you know who it be

[Hook]
The commander in chief
Stand on your feet
Give me praise when I come to the stage, arms raised
I will amaze, homie check my resume
It's Snuff man on the beat, goddamn it it's Reef

[Verse Two]
And now that I'm high
Oh I forgot I'm never not
I just smoked and that makes not a minute gone by
That me, myself and I haven't rolled the lah
And blazed up motherfucker, raise up motherfucker
Shoot the place up
Psych, nah, I'm just kidding
The only time I really bust is when your mom's pay a visit (the milkman!)
I'm sick wit it, keep it cookin'
And flow so tight I got Jew broads
Pinchin' my cheek callin' me "Reefer Snookins"
That wasn't a racist joke but did I shock ya?
Oh I'm sorry, was that your face my hand hit, did I sock ya?
The hottest MC in your house is not ya
And you live alone with a puppy named Sasha, I'm a monster
Don't be scared
You wasn't prepared
You like a joke that keeps gettin' funnier and funnier
Keep laughin'
Keep gaspin' for air
Now are all y'all with me up in here?
If not, I'mma cry backstage, psych
I give a fuck about none of y'all cause bitch I'm paid
I'm rich beeyotch
My momma laughed and said "You wish beeyotch
Pay the rent beeyotch."
I'm not serious
I've been smokin' so much homie I think I'm delirious
Fuck how ya feel, no motions involved
When I grab a pen and paper and fuck a beat raw
I'm Lost Cauze

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
And I'm blastin' off bangin' on niggas like basketball
While you only get respect overseas like David Hasselhoff
What's the matter dawg
Are you mad cause I keep waving this red flag like a deranged matador?
Just kickin' the dust up
Send me your man I'll rip him the fuck up
And leave his body parts in four different dump trucks
You dudes is numb nuts
Don't make me wild on stage
And tie two mics together and use them shits as nunchucks
You want what?
Not a damn thang
It's Lost Cauze playboy, I run the damn game
And bars I spit sickly
And I could drop 50 but I'm tired so the hook
Come on, sing it with me

[Hook][Verse 1: Esoteric]
In '95 this rap style was impressive
By 2005 most rappers lost the message
2014, rappers wearing dresses
Shit is tough to look at like airplane wreckage
Check it
I'ma waste you the chemicals will lace you
My rep keeps growing like Emma Stone's face do
You recently decent I've been a beast every season
My pen and speech is the reason I'm pulling wenches with ease
And I'll take that Benz that you're leasing
I'll put a dent in the crease and driver side leave you leaking
A homicide call a deacon
I'll have you wheezing in deep
Breathing the beat I'm just meat
Cleaving, I'm coming to meet Steven
King, I'm a demon ayo

[Verse 2: Planetary]
Keep me outta reach of your children's ears
This the surgeon general warning
You rap moguls I'm the shit to hear
Crystal clear, missiles tear through the fiscal year
Bombs over Baghdad, official pistol is you fear
Fear not the ear's hot, your atmosphere pop
Every bar souvenir, nigga keep your ears locked
Dog you must got me chop
Everything about me rugged
Low rugby ruckus, my middle name and I'm soul crushing
(It's nothing)
Wiping the dust off the Paper Mate
I'll leave a paper trail for my niggas like it's The Great Escape
Save the date the birthday of the Bathing Ape
No holds barred, bar none, I'ma raise the stake

[Verse 3: Apathy]
I was raised by a pack of werewolves in the woods
Grew up studying Mobb Deep, 'Give Up The Goods'
Now I'm walking down this block, half human half monster
Stronger, full moon's rise I go bonkers
I'm popular in Hell like The Lox in Yonkers
Glocks and bombers, box full of rocket launchers
Optic lasers, 2Pac tapes and box cutters
I ain't playing with none of you cocksuckers
Make whores stop in the store first to cop rubbers
Got lawyers on retainer if one of these cops touch us
I ain't feeling what they did to Kelly Thomas
Keep guns on us so they'll never beat me unconscious, listen

[Verse 4: Vinnie Paz]
Listen up motherfuckers I'm sick and tired of playing with y'all
My gun told me I'm a sucker for aiming at ch'all
I am from a different cloth, no relation to y'all
And when it come to me and you it's no patience involved
The Lucifery conspiracy of Forward Pass
Allah seeking while y'all are speaking the balderdash
Cipher protocol, indecipherable ocean mask
The Code of Aframet, I will worship the goat and laugh
Follow what you have found, I will lead you to us
Every single record sold is a beacon to us
He a greaseball but he like a Rican to us
It's like a carnivore eating a vegan to us

[Verse 5: Crypt The Warchild]
You can't tame a villain that's trained for the killing
Insane in the brain off of the pain that he's feeling
I don't tear it down, I cave and break through the ceiling
I don't spare these clowns I continue to drill 'em
I bury them alive then stop the pussy from squealing
Your music's all fool's gold that's not for appealing
Listen
I don't rhyme without a reason
Money makes me metamorphacize to a demon
Bitches lined up screaming murder for the semen
Two for every one so I had to bring the team in
AOTP, niggas best to pledge allegiance
So cats are universal with your head right to the cement

[Verse 6: Celph Titled]
Look behind door number one, and it might be a rifle
How dare you think you can read the psyche of a psycho
I got a demon as a house pet
An arsenal, a crook with alien technology (what?) that ain't out yet
My CD ain't biodegradable
So they gon' find it centuries ahead but won't have nothing that can play it though (whatever)
Oh the irony, your flesh need ironing
We buried you in a mountain cape but that was just a minor/miner thing
They say you can hear the beach inside a seashell
But all I hear is "murder" when I load the pump with these shells
Competition might be good but they ain't half as nice
I set the bar so high it interfere with space satellites

[Verse 7: Reef The Lost Cauze]
Your shit is trash homie, please don't hype it
Whatever we spit, these dweebs gon' bite it
Your girl fucked all of us, please don't wife it
These rappers is selling lies but we don't buy it
I live off of three words: release and fire
Y'all described in three words: weak and tired
When I go to war, I don't mean I beat this guy up
I mean I went in his mouth removed his teeth with pliers
I mean...he no longer sleeps at night
Cause I pulled him out his car and made him eat the tires
This is Hell on Earth, may you all sleep in fire
You'll be the dopest alive the day Reef retires

[Verse 8: King Syze]
They know my rhyming scheme is a pattern of dying dreams
I'm glad it's over, a disease to a dying breed
A pitbull lion who screams, who's surrounded by bees
A pack of wolves, your career will be over with ease
"Nigga please" is a new motto I live by
On records I'm still fly, y'all rappers will still die
We all monstrous, Godzilla spitter honors
Spit on the ground, pollute the soil man and kill the farmers
Y'all all goners I'm still rocking that dope shit
Y'all progress is hopeless, I'm a product of dopeness
I learned from the best, can't you smell the uniqueness?
Animal instinct, I can smell your fucking weakness

[Verse 9: Lawrence Arnell]
The enforcer, change your whole life course
The mic cords be recharging my life force
The nice boy from north, I get the point across
You on the balls, I ain't even on the forth bar
I pack a powerful punch, I make a horse fall
Your shorty wetting her drawers, I make a house call
You get your mouth off, I'm not even here for y'all
I'm here for reasons that have clearly been stated before
The greatest to fall, equated to the falling gods
The homie never been accused of ever falling off
Supported by the most invincive rappers breathing air
You gonna keep it fair, get your fucking people here[Verse 1: Doap Nixon]
I’m in the kitchen cooking up bananas
Cameras on the roofs with the police scanners
By any means I’ma get these papers
Ride with a nigga or catch these vapors
Smooth melodic, cool water with butters on
Got beef with a nigga, save that for another song
Paz on point so he putting his brothers on
Steeze still the same, get you murked by a gutter jawn
Head in the streets cause the whip is spacious
Benz stretched out legs feel like a spaceship
Checks ain’t clear, I’m hitting y’all with the facts
If the check never came I’d hit your mom in the cap
Got the streets on smash, kilos on wax
Hundred pack on iTunes trying to make cream back
Yeah, the key’s cooked and the bricks is stove-top
It’s Chef Boyardee flipping nicks on your whole block

[Verse 2: Des Devious]
Yeah, born in the coldest winter, live and I die a sinner
And while I’m here I’m hustling, get paper with my niggas
Last of a dying breed, Pharaoh clique in your section
Before I leave my rest, kiss my Wess, load my weapon
Yeah that’s my right hand man, that fifty cal chrome
Off-safety when I roam, I ain’t never alone
Won’t catch a nigga slipping, won’t catch a nigga dipping
Cause I done mastered my high, you out your mind tripping
Yeah you can come and try, won’t be the smartest move
My bitch’ll pull the hammer and make it do what it do
Hustler, a son of one, bitch I’m a son of one
My money done got right, copped me another gun

[Verse 3: Crypt The Warchild]
These punk bitches get the bozak, the gas face
I feel like Earnhardt in his last race
This last lap in this game, I’ma hit the throttle
Syze, we celebrate new life, hit this bottle
Plan, I think the situation’s getting hairy
We make them say the Our Father and the Hail Mary
Scary how niggas turn Judas, no trust
I take it back to 5-6 when it was only us
Snakes slither in the grass in the killing field
So I maneuver through them by sitting in a bigger wheel
You’s a small time hustler, I’m a bigger deal
And that shit you spill gon’ be the shit that get you killed
Ready for war and I’m in it for the long haul
Throwing a molotov sidearm
Yeah, holding my fort with my pipes drawn
I kill everything when this mic’s on, believe it

[Hook: Demoz]
Ayo, f-u-c-k F-B-I cops and niggas who don’t like my shit
I tell them niggas suck a dirty dick with gonorrhea on the tip
I’m getting money courtesy of your bitch
Nigga it’s the Army of the Pharaohs, we hood American Idols
You don’t like us? You can suck my dick
I got a long rope and an oxy if you feeling suicidal
See that window? Hop out that bitch

[Verse 4: Demoz]
Now if you think you can easily be it then be it but see me not
I’m too heated and weeded to lose it so please be hot
They just fiending to be the most conceited team on the top
I’m leaning to be the most meanest as Biggie and Pac
Man these demons is dreaming like I just grieve for their spot
It’s easy to see they just want to be me cause I’m hot
So fuck my theme and my plot, smoking weed in your rock
And fall dummy to that casket cause they eat at you pop
You can believe it or not, I done sold weed to a cop
Caught a case, banged it and ran back to the fiends on my block
Fiends on my block? That’s logical, my flow is phenomenal
I put a couple dots on your block like dominoes
Red beaming them, I stay with my team and them
I keep four nines in the tuck like Steve and them
Diss my track, I'll diss like that
Cause when you shoot like a free-throw you miss like Shaq

[Verse 5: Planetary]
I’m from Killadelph county, the killers they all surround me
I’m losing my nigga slowly, Poppa Large, I make him proud of me
If you see Nemi then tell your people to see me
I’m here for the take and holding these streets down, believe me
My nigga Balo, I know your halo is platinum
I’ma see you at the gates, I’ll be rocking something ravishing
The Seven Sacraments made for the sacrificial
The baptismal of rap bristle to sacramental
My rap essentials is murder tracks and pencils
Gat utensils is only used for niggas acting simple
My syllable slice niggas like a cesarean
You killable right? I spit bars like a barbarian

[Verse 6: Reef The Lost Cauze]
I never thought I’d see the day hip hop would give birth to faggots
Mr. T mohawks and Urkel glasses, I’m from a hood where they rob cool kids
And I can’t wear skinny jeans cause my Glock’s too big
Yeah, I got the wildest style, death bears a childish smile
Beat you with soap in a sock, you a Private Pyle
I fear order, from green onions I peel quarters
What’s rap? I bump Foghat and Creedence Clearwater
Bad moon rising, I’m howling at the bitch
Haters baffled how he spent a thousand on the kicks
I get thousands just to spit, fuck all the drama shit
I don’t make statements, get bank statements and deposit slips
And it’s always gonna be this way
C-notes like study hall in tenth grade
To this day I fuck bitches and get paid
What’s piff? I got the green monster like Fenway
Mmmkay?

[Hook][Verse One]
I make you a believer
Split your house in a half
Bring you Danger and Doom without a mouse or a mask
What I need in life? An ounce or a flask
It's the Cauze, don't make me put your mouth in your ass
Talk shit? You will eat that
If I wanted feedback
I would've simply asked you, "Yo, where's the weed at?"
I leave you stubborn like the drums underneath me
I can't hear you screaming if you so underneath me
Fuck with Reef be
Abby's first born
I'll leave you looking like the [?]
You know the aftermath
Don't need jumping in attach ya ass
You better than me? My label's Aftermath
An Eminem's a nigga from Philly
I don't fear another man, I'm a nigga from Philly
That means I'm supposed to die soon
But I won't cause I defy fools
With my mystic mind tools
Psych nah, I'm behind you
And a nine too
Leon with the Peon will drive off when it's time to
Who wouldn't find you?
Ask Magnetic?
I replied, "Fuck him, give me three more beats on credit."
Inside joke
I'm not fire, I'm the fumes that exist inside smoke
That ain't good weed, that's 'I hope I get high smoke'
I'm known for beautiful bitches and foul quotes
You little cow poke
I'm Apache
Bring the beef to the cow show, now how dope
Is the kid from the 'Delph?
If I gave you more you'd probably shit on yourself
I don't sell "weed"
Crack or pop toasters what's in my holsters
Enough ammo to take over pop culture
You high, "No sir"
Lost Cauze the spot blower
Game over[Speaking]
It's 2005
I'm 'bout to blow some heads off, man
I got so much shit 'bout to hit these dudes, man
Feast (?) classic, Juju Mob classic, y'know I mean?
My team is comin', Good Hands

[Verse 1]
Yo, I give it to you straight, never speak fakely
Sharif T Lacey, they say he's crazy
I'm only Lost Cauze when I got the .380
This is my costume, no moniker to make you eat daisies
None needed, son weeded
For some reason, on the mic I become some demon
Other emcees eat they lungs even
You think not? Come see 'em
From the stage you will run fleein'
I need more cowbell, throw in your towels
You make the crowd swell with bottles
Thrown at you, I'm the grave robber, throne snatcher
Don't matter, I attack like throat cancer
You can't rap, but you's a dope dancer
A hype man, go adjust my mic stand
I roll with ???, who love to make your life stop
You've been dismissed, go home and get your shine box

[Hook]
[Echo] It's the Cauze, it's the Cauze...
[Scratch: KRS-One] Emcees act like they don't know
[Scratch: 50 Cent] I'm the underground king, and I ain't been crowned
[Scratch: Styles P] Motherfuckers hit your knees and just pray to the Lord

[Verse 2]
No pimp cup, no gators (?)
No trucker hat, no blazer
I'm from the city that spawned Joe Frasier
Bernard Hopkins, stay the fuck out of my zone, haters
Now I'm no Messiah, I'm no savior
But when the mic's in my clutch there's no greater
It's like a vato loco with no razor
A black man's Kool Aid with no flavor
ESPN with no Raiders
Or the Lost Cauze out for sale with no takers
That movie +Tron+ with no lasers
An episode of +Oz+ with no rapers
The X Games with no skaters
You get the gist; my only exercise is sit and twist
I'm just as quick as Michael Vick
Cuz I'm getting' blitzed like a three-four defense
Won't be tackled in the Three Four Precinct

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm the omen in rhyme form
You soft as nylon
I spit hot fire like Dilawn, Dilawn, Dilawn
Mind gone from buds 's big as pine cones
The Lost Cauze is a motherfucking cyclone
Get caught in my path, and I divide homes
You don't want to die, homes
I talk with my nine chrome
He's highly upset
Rush the stage with pure rage if you deny me a set
I ain't playin', dog
This is beast music, this is Reef music
Treat your face like bongos, this the beat movement
Daddy-yo the beat bruiser, leave your teeth looser
You'll be foolish to not cop that +Feast+, stupid
Cuz this a banger-banger, cock the thing and bang ya
Danger, danger, one remains in the chamber
Hot wire hanger, bash your face in
Now go fuck yourself like masturbation
The father of this bastard nation
I'm hard like chemistry and math equations
Leave your face full of holes like the mask of Jason
I'm past the waitin', getting at these bastards hatin'
I'm sicker than a faggot Hatian filling his veins with H hits
My gun plastic like some fake tits (Nigga!)
I don't make hits, I just crap classics that make you want to break shit
You fake bitch!

Bleh! Bleh! Bleh! Bleh! Bleh!

[Talking]

White Boy 1: Everybody's always talking about the legends, they talking
About Biggie and Pac (White Boy 2: Yeah, fuck those two) and Pun and Big L
No one's talking about the real legends (WB2: Hell yeah)
The guys on top right now (WB2: Hell yeah)
I'm talking about the Sages (WB2: Sage? Sage is down with the Klan!)
The Aesops, my man Combustion Justin right here, are you kidding me?
(WB3: Old school rap is doo doo, dude, it's garbage)
He's the next big thing, listen to him
WB3: I need, like, beats that don't even sound like beats
WB1: Yeah, exactly, they should be like "ERr Err err err"
WB3: Who wants to dance anymore anyways?
WB2: It's the blacks
WB3: Yo, yo, rip that shit Combustion

Combustion: [Rapping]

Yo, yo, yo, yo
My rhyme style you can't even measure
Cuz I flow like Helium (WB2: Mmm) at 40 times atmospheric pressure (WB2:
Here he goes)
I'm super fluid nice, can't rap but I can almost write (WB2: Uh ha)
Can't fight but I can almost bite
Hate Bush cuz he's stealing my rights
Actually I just like to gripe (WB2: West Hartford, what!) because my skin is
White
I hate my dad, see, cuz he don't like
Paying for me to sit on my ass and smoke this pipe (WB2: Go Justin)
That's what I do because I'm so bored
Got this super silver haze weed that you can't afford (WB2: Connecticut!)
And I'm crazy fly like the Wright Brothers
Nerd rapper of the yo, yo, yo man like Tom and Dick Smothers
Might be Shabba Ranks ugly, but I'm "Mister Lover Lover"

[Black A&R]
Man, that shit is corny, man. Ok?
Let me tell you somethin'
My artist Corleone Capone from Big Dog Entertainment (Barks)
He will eat yo' shit...
Ay, Corleone, tells these niggas how the street, hood, y'know'm sayin'
Rich, big time, killa crack niggas do it

Corleone: Yo, yo this young Corleone Capone the enforcer AKA Real Clinton
Y'feel what I'm sayin'?
[Rapping] Yo, I cop the coke, pop the toast
Keep a bottle of Cris to pop and toast
Cook the crack, cut the crack, I sell the crack
I love the crack! Did I mention I got crack, nigga?
Keep a gat that'll put it in your back, nigga
Four shots you'll be layin' out flat, nigga, OH!
Pop the top, drop the top
Cop a grip, chop the block
I'm bout to cop the block, the block is hot
The block is a block that block the blocks, OH! Feel me?!
I rock the rocks, that rock the rocks
Then drop the drop, cops get shot, the pop...
I got shots for tops, niggas!

[Talking with A&R talking shit in the background]
Young Corleone Capone a force of AKA Real Clinton, y'know'm sayin'?
JFK Jr. of this rap shit, y'know'm sayin'?
I got bricks comin' out my ass, nigga, y'know'm sayin'?
I sleep bricks, nigga, y'know'm sayin'?
I got cocaine everywhere, nigga, yea![Intro: Vinnie Paz]
Yeah, one time, ha ha
Pharaoh clique

[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
I got no time for extra shit
I'm like a bad film editor with extra clips
You never shit where you eat unless you extra bitch
You never get no relief like I'm next to pitch
I'm on the throne, all alone where the Devil sit
Son of the Wise la-Hakim Menelik
Laugh at the unbeliever you malevolent
He only half as nice, sacrifice his sentiment
Praise be the God, he defy logical
Put me at the foul line, take two shots at you
Death life, life death so horrible
Let this motherfucking bulldog bark at you

[Verse 2: Apathy]
Jubala, Jubalo Jubalum
I'm a giant on this earth, fee-fi-fo-fum
Cerebellum over-loader make your brain stem numb
Super fans make their bitch wanna swallow my cum
You can't clash with a Pharaoh, there's nowhere to run
As quick as I put the clip in it go in the gun
Everything is slow motion, blood go in your lungs
Ridiculous as Icarus flying close to the sun
I'm a Supernova, nobody escapes my gravity
Graffiti on the moon spelling out the name Apathy
Undisputed king of the Milky Way Galaxy
I'd eat your whole squad but I got a wackness allergy
Tyrannical, over-sized cannibal
I'm the son of Samuel, murder without the manual
The tomb of King Tut pimp sluts rip guts
From opponents while I'm drinking their blood from my pimp cup

[Hook] x2
Pharaoh Clique
We bust ya shit
You know it’s no holds barred
When the bars we spit
It goes: what-what?
It goes: what-what? (Pharaohs!)
AOTP get your wig split!

[Verse 3: Celph Titled]
Times change, but my mind-frame just loves war
Ted Danson from Cheers, I'm above Norm
I exploit performers that's wack
Record raps on my phone's voice recorder app
Permanent hunchback, from keeping my city on my spine
Cause I've been making tracks since A hats and Karl Kani
Get your bitch far more wet
When I get paid, it's a fuckin' party with a giant cardboard check
The Army is a hardcore set
Paper before pussy, these haters is all rookies
I give 'em bowling ball noogies
No warning shots, mister
I empty ammo crates 'til my palms got blisters

[Verse 4: Esoteric]
Ayo, Pharaoh death blow, the violent tempo
Your so dead to me like the Pirate's retro
Found on Willie Stargell, I kill these bars well
Lift 'em like a barbell, you sound like Marcel the Shell
When you rhyme, I'm unveiled
Designed, my heart sails
De Lima Cartel, is five times bigger
The Czar melts your mind
I spit like a .9
Is that fast? I don't even know
I typically use a EE-3 Carbine Rifle that Boba Fett shoot
Execute rappers underwater, tie a wire to their wet-suit
Barracudas eat 'em, we don't need 'em
We beat 'em, then we bleed 'em out
Trash 'em and delete 'em

[Verse 5: Reef The Lost Cauze]
Taste the beast, I'm a motherfuckin' Minotaur
Catch a hot flash like an old broad with menopause
AOTP clique, those been my dogs
You don't believe in me? You can't believe there is a God
You must be an Atheist
They don't ever try and test me, I must be the craziest
You ain't make a move yet? You must be the laziest
Your team is shook, and I bet you the shakiest
I split your head to the white meat
The gun's roar so fuckin' loud, you'd think that it was Bike Week
I'm from Philly, where the cost of life cheap
50 bones get you gone by Ricans down Pike Street
I'm not a blog creation, I'm not a hype beast
I am the embodiment of dope rhymes and a right beat
I am the result of Scarface and Ice-T
Tan trees, white tees, my niggas think just like me
I'm nice G

[Hook] 2x

[Reef The Lost Cauze]
AOTP raw rap forever![Intro]

An innocent man becomes a target of insanity as he steps into the crosshairs of a homicidal maniac with a need for revenge. Join us for a journey into the dark ? of a sick and twisted man. Join us for a journey into living hell

[Verse 1: Doap Nixon]
I feel lightning in my fingertips
? status, I give a nigga his wings bitch
Sleep on me, creep on me
Throw heat on me and I’m still gonna eat homie
Ill Bill from La Costra Nostra
Come sideways and we’ll both ? ya
Reef got the toaster, all I gotta do is whistle
And my bitches will smoke ya
What more can an underground rapper say?
How longer is these rappers gonna shine gay?
First up is 'Ye, second and third is Ye and my shit get no play
Where I’m from yo the jakes’ll murk ya
Act like you know and the fiends’ll jerk ya
Three classics under my belt
I just lost my comrade, I need something to melt

[Verse 2: Reef The Lost Cauze]
You think you BIG or 2Pac, you Nosferatu
I’m Ferragamos, murder, death, kill, homo
There’s no tomorrow, you won’t see the evening news
Rolling ? goose spin your top like Beetlejuice
We the truth, you talking about the cat you hit
Vicious as the blackened spears and sleep for half a year
You only bust your gat in air
Yeah you killing the clouds, having shootouts with the atmosphere
You the wackest here, unable for my rap to fear
You live fairy tales like glass slippers and magic mirrors
Who’s the fairest? Speak the language of Arabs
Sharif terror, send em to the sky like a chair lift
I’m original, never jocking y’all style
I steel a nigga, watch him slide like crocodile mile
I’m the wild child style vile since wild style
My guns go boom boom, your guns go pow pow

[Hook] {x2}
Deadly sins, we ain’t gonna pray for em
Ill Bill and Reef, I’mma spray for em
Five niggas that’s the best in the game
If the niggas ain’t fam then they feeling the flame

[Verse 3: King Magnetic]
It’s the heavy metal king, ain’t talking about the group though
Cause I’ll beat a gun charge right through the loop hole
Still down to shoot though, use em accordingly
They supported me, protected what my music afforded me
Disorderly, hold your beef, do them shits grimy
Literally down with Doap since the mid-90s
That’s right, face cringe from the syringe binge
And friends bend every rule that you made within
Aim and spray again, nothing like a window cleaner
Talk politics up close ?
Unfold in front of your eyes is binoculars
You need stock in the Apocalypse to rock with us
If not it’s AZ about to rock it up
Doing open heart surgery on your esophagus
I’mma die profitless like cult leaders
Aim assault heaters at adult divas throwing ?

[Verse 4:Ill Bill]
The game of thrones, stick you for your chains and clothes
Most rappers will suck dick for cocaine and dro
Ratchets explode, homie my chrome’ll rape your soul
Bring twelve plagues like Moses raining toads
Fuck your tongue wanted the blood
Hit you in the head with inaudible guns
Unfortunate ones get tortured and hung
The cult leader homie with the sorcerer’s tongue
Heavy Metal King influence your daughters and sons
You the topic of the song Shook Ones from Mobb Deep
I’m harder than bricks or football on concrete
Chilling in deadstock Jordans, millions of dead cops
Warnings, COs, informants
A hip hop Blackie Lawless, see more bodies than coroners
Unfamiliar aura, peel off shotties at foreigners
Grinning with pride, gorillas with militant minds
You win or you die, I’ll empty the clip in your eye

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Vinnie Paz]
There’s no oath to the goat, throw his body in the moat
Bucky fifty to windpipe, go for the throat
Pussy boy rappers better hold rosary close
Ain’t too many in my cypher that’s closer than Doap
Throw the faggot in the water, I hope that he float
Hope they ready for the slaughter, it’s  awfully close
I think he wanna kill himself I offer him rope
My vision is blurry, I’m seeing Allah through a scope
Boxcutter Paz John the Baptist
Ain’t nobody safe when I bomb you bastards
Only thing I think about is Lam and gat clips
Jordans, Grey Goose, bitches, and caskets
I’m an ugly motherfucker, give me a fat bitch
A dime is too much work, Vinnie is savage
Rob a motherfucker, rip through his assets
The 28 V rip through your cabbage[Intro]
We were willing to die for an ideal and we would die for it again
But we prefer living for it, working for it, safeguarding it

[Hook: Planetary] x2
A.O.T.P., we above the law
See the cops start running nigga call the dogs
They can't see me, I throw that Molotov
And clear the whole field out, nigga call the gods

[Verse 1: Demoz]
I don't give a fuck about you
I swing my blade and take a chunk up out you
Chase the driver that's trying to save you
And lace 'em with the scalpel
Break your Adam's-- apple and clap you and leave you mangled
I'm not the asshole claiming Philly, I'm blowing up the fucking castle
Fuck pity and mercy I'm thirsty for the title
Kill your vitals with verses, curses
And hearses move 'em like Vinny Idol
Take Vinnie and Planet, mould 'em inside a bowling ball
Launch em against the way you claim you carry
Break your shoulders off
Just for showing off you're stupid
I don't threaten niggas, I really do this
Squeeze the juice out of you like embalming fluid
Burn his lid, barbecue 'em and fuckin' burn his ribs
Throw the dress away with the evidence
Burn a fucking wig

[Verse 2: Celph Titled]
I got plans for your murder and I'm ready to discuss em
You're ready to die? Tell God I said, "Fuck him."
Call me Iron Fist motherfucker I aim hard
Bullets are free throw, silencer is the proof guard
Said you was a crook but you ain't busting no lead homes
Only jack you pulling is connected to some headphones
The sound of the clap louder than several operas
My sitcom screaming "I'm gonna kill you" across the Teleprompter
Yes I'm sick fuck the Zicam and Zyrtec
How you gonna fight man when y'all resemble Smurfette?
Stretch your neck till your head meets your ass
I'll beat your dad dead now he's a deadbeat dad

[Verse 3: Planetary]
Nothing is ever promised, especially your life I demolish
Too many niggas claim street but wouldn't last in the projects
Too many happy-go-lucky cats rap with no money
Black why you gotta act? I be screaming where the money at?
I never understood your hood mentality
Man you still selling weed on the block dog, that's blasphemyy
That's embarrassing, you nickel and dimin'
A small cut off a bundle and you thinking you shinin'
I could rumble in the jungle and tussle with all the lions
My hustle could turn to rustle but for now I'm survivin'
Living
My kids are chillin' and I'm whippin' the new boy
It ain't a Maybach but it's better than your toy

[Hook] x2
A.O.T.P., we above the law
See the cops start running nigga call the dogs
They can't see me, I throw that Molotov
And clear the whole field out, nigga call the gods

[Verse 4: Reef The Lost Cauze]
I'm a motherfucking warlock, get your jaw popped by the raw rock
Use your tongue as a doorstop, with your face I floor mop
Get your pores popped
Like a dermatologist, I'm wildin' with
Thugs who go in your mouth like Polident
I body shit, I ruin you homes
Turn your studio session into a funeral home
Two in your dome
Got young bucks who buck for us
Homie follow the laws of God
And Chuck Norris
A.O.T.P
We in good company
Screamin', "We the fuckin' world champs" like we Chase Utley
My whole fam-o, tuck in the gauge, bustin' them K's
Have your block sounding like the Mummers Parade

[Verse 5: Vinnie Paz]
I've been catching fucking bodies for twenty years
From eating motherfuckers on the street up to bloody tears
Camouflage backpacks, Tims and some money wares
Now these rap faggots fucking sweeter than Gummy Bears
This isn't simple arithmetic, this is ancient math
Make you lose your face in Jehovah/Jay Hova like you was Damon Dash
I take a fucking machete and cut your brain in half
You're fucking with something deadly and Vinnie Satan laughs
I'm the greatest rapper alive
The Vin bias
Cause I ain't get my chance to shine, call me Len Bias
I'll be patiently waiting for you if men try us
I don't call it writing no more
I call it a pen virus

[Verse 6: Apathy]
You [?] mixtape rappers I should snap your throat
Bunch of tracks cracking jokes 'bout crack and coke (release the Krakken)
Ap is the crackers last hope
Honkey Kong fuckin' bitches leaving mattresses broke
If the condom break I'mma tell the bitch to abort
I'm like the sniper on the roof looking out for the stork
Little dogs getting shanked for a box of Newports
There ain't a jail that could hold me cause Ap teleports
Skipping court on the porch with the criminal sorts
You was usin' couch cushions buildin' living room forts
Your mom's pouring yayo on my dick to snort
I only rock a halo to hide horns and pitchforks

[Hook] x2[Verse 1]
He was a real nigga, stayed on the block pitching
He and his crew would rock jeans that said stop snitching
He wasn't the violent type but he would see evil on all kind of nights
And chose to remain the silent type
I'm not saying call the cops, the beast won't help
But shit in the hood we police ourselves
Hate on no man trying to increase his wealth
But don't turn your back on your neighbour when they need your help
And he did that night that they robbed that old lady
They ain't mean to kill her but the bitch went crazy
Seen the whole thing and just shut his blinds
But he couldn't get the image of her busted spine from his blunted mind
Time passed and the summer was sick
That was until his little brother got hit
Now he's out for answers but niggas stick to the script
So when he asked what happened ain't nobody seen shit

[Hook] [x2]
And there's only so long you can play devil's advocate
Before the snake comes back and now your back is bit
Half the worrying, half the risk
But a whole world of problems come from playing devil's advocate

[Verse 2]
He was the youngest VP of a Fortune 500
Porsche out front, Armani suits by the hundreds
His bosses screwed over anyone that they wanted
The type to fuck the wife and then fire the husband
The ruthless titans of industry
There's lawyers and accountants are more organized than the Genovese
Made plenty enemies but his logic was
If these people were smart then they'd be as rich as me
His ambition blinded him so
He was a good man once but loot divided his soul
Now his company is floundering, about to be jobless
He's under investigation for trading on stock tips
Reporters out back sifting through garbage
Got a lien on his house, they trying to take where his mom live
Went to his old boss who's met at the door
He said, "I'm sorry son, we've never met before."

[Hook] [x2]

[Verse 3]
Never turn a blind eye to the evil that's upon you
Cause if you do believe me that shit will haunt you
I remember a few years back I witnessed a heinous act
And I did not react, I sat back and just let it happen
I just sat there stunned, I should've helped but I guess I was young
I guess I was dumb, felt like a punk
The stench of guilt hung on my skin for weeks like a skunk
And to this day I see the face of a stranger
Who was drowning and I could've been her anchor
If I had to do it all again I would've stood tall and lent her my hand
I would've fought like a man, I would've come to her rescue and done all I can
But the fucked up thing is I'll never get that chance
Never never never

[Hook] [x2][Verse 1: Planetary]
Your boy back, boy that sound good to the masses
My boy Blac, Reef, Esoteric, we massive
The art of dots, and now we aiming them at your management
He like a mannequin, stiff a nigga? We stabbing 'em
Your distribution deal, deaded from that Louisville
Planetary shoot to kill, tell me how this bullet feel
Ain't no fighting tooth and nail this is what I do for real
Money, man I need something like Meek Mill's Puma deal
I let the Ruger peel nigga this is Vietnam
Very rare, you can give a stare and seem calm
I'm a caged up animal, you flammable
I'm pouring gasoline on your mixtapes and camera crew

[Verse 2: Reef the Lost Cauze]
Ah Snap! I got the power still
It's light work like I just paid my power bill
I never know how a coward feel
Y'all got the bitter face, you been sucking on a sour dill
Back and bigger, the baddest spitter
My man Eso just bought a crib off of Czarface action figures
Make more off merchandise than you will in your worthless life
A hundred "Fuck you, pay me" t-shirts, they be gone tonight
The mic that I'm holding is probably stolen
You a deceiver, I’m a retriever, stay golden like Logan
I'm in Rome doing shows with the Romans
In those little ass hotel rooms, the windows won't open
I'm hot!

[Hook x 2]
Stay off these nuts
Rappers better ease up
I roll my sleeves up
And fuck a few MCs up
They light work, light work
Like raking leaves up
They talking like they got that heat
But they freeze up

[Verse 3: Blacastan]
Concubines worship the ground that I walk on
Chalk outlines on corners that I stalked on
Let's see who loves you when you under the rubble
Let's see who rides with you when that ass is really in trouble
Roll up a notebook and spit a sharp pencil through it
What I'm spitting acid, poisonous fluid
Champion hooded, blacked out like the arch-druid
Punch through your chest and snatch your weak ass heart through it
300 time deeper than your idol Leonidas
If there's beef, never sleep - I'll call and reunite us
Bicker and squabble and beats, never could divide us
In your cerebral, we spreading like it's gingivitis

[Verse 4: Esoteric]
Coming to you liver
Crack your jaw, get a wire
It's Black Goliath, rap messiah, rapid fire
Stu Bangas on the track, that's the crack supplier
Everything is in sync, we don't match attire
Slang rough, hangin' tough, no McIntyre
You say you getting rap money and it's stacking higher
But you a nine-to-fiver
That can't find the time to pass out a stack of flyers
Shit, you a crappy liar
Call me your Sire
Bad to the bone, back in the zone
I didn't need nobody's help, no I acted alone
They say they thugging, they're bugging
What type of thugging is clubbing
And popping bub' outside the VIP and tuggin'
On the velvet rope, hoping to avoid a snubbing
Claiming that they hella' dope, but they don't sell, they broke
They're the usual, and couldn't see it with a telescope
Cause they delusional[Verse 1: Jus Allah]
Bullets take your life I take a hundred and fifties
Kiss yourself goodbye, ya body covered in hickeys
Keep the guns cocked for you fucking faggots and sissys
Always in the bad activity, actively
Slow with[???] twenty words and stab Agatha Christie
Stab both the whores in the abdomen and kidneys
Put the bodies where you play catch and toss Frisbees
Add to a long history of unsolved mysteries
Guns don't kill people, evil kills people
These streets is lethal but guns keep it equal
Take white chrome[???] and put you in the morgue
Take you from your Mom take your fucking chip off your arm
Keep biscuits like it's the fucking house of Saddam
Me and Reef the Lost Cauze spit an ounce of Patron
While your drowning in the fucking pond that the cops found you in
Pounding on your chest counting worm [???] one thousand

[Hook: Reef the Lost Cauze] [x2]
I call them cocksucker
You fucking dick taster
Ain't nobody fucking with Goons or Sicknature
Reef the Lost Cauze, Jus Allah we black as Vader
Fuck around again, I'll blaze ya
The euthanasia

[Verse 2: Reef the Lost Cauze]
And I pray ya, don't think God'll save ya
Heavy metal shit, metal clip, chrome Slayer
I'll blaze ya, feed you to a swarm of gators
I'm with King Jus, no hey ya hey ya
We started out minor now we fucking up the majors
Only crew close to AOTP Al-Qaeda
Face scrape ya, off the bottom of my Blazers
With more clips than a barbershop hand razor
I'm in the chair player gettin' a Philly fade
My niggas praise we'll make it rain/reign for fifty days
Fuck forty, she front and fuck shorty
You pour champagne in glasses faggot we drunk 40s
Empty nines, hold macs and dump .40s
Y'all dumb corny, wildin' 'til the lord come for me
L's twisted up, shells hittin' ya, you see hell sent for you
Box your fucking head off like P. Fell[???] with a drum

[Hook] [x4]

[Verse 3: Sicknature]
Sicknature's a goon blazin' a way that'll sickle fail
Beats create earthquakes that'll be breaking the Richter scale
Independent, rap venomous, when I'm deadin' you fast
You wouldn't listen to your own shit with your head up your ass (what?)
Stomach rumbles, my hunger increase, so I ain't coming with peace, Ammo flow clip dumpin' with Reef
No love when I jump on this beat
Smack cupid toothless and rob the tooth fairy when she come for the teeth
Beats of the week combined with the spit that I sneeze at you
We'll make you feel smaller than a dick on a Greek statue
Underground independence, me signed with a big major?
"Fuck y'all" signed to Sicknature
The rap actors got no clue
Get some arsenal instead instead shoved so far up your ass it'll look like a gold tooth
Fuck with my Goons that's a fatal approach
Cause panic like if the Yellowstone volcano explodes
Nature!!!

[Hook] [x3]
