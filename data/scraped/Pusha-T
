Whoa, make the ground move, that's an ass quake
Built a house up on that ass, that's an ass-tate
Roll my weed on it, that's an ass tray
Say Ye, say Ye don't we do this every day-day? (huh?)
I work them long nights, long nights to get a pay day (huh?)
Finally got paid, now I need shade and a vacay
(And niggas still hatin') So much hate I need an AK
Now we out in Paris, yeah I'm Perrierin'

Gettin' hot, Californicatin'

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Yuugh!
It's prime time, my top back, this pimp game, ho
I'm red leather, this cocaine, I'm Rick James, ho
I'm bill-droppin', Ms. Pac-Man, this pill poppin'-ass ho
I'm poppin' too, these blue dolphins need two coffins
All she want is some heel money, all she need is some bill money
He take his time, he counts it out, I weighs it up, that's real money
Check the neck, check the wrist, them heads turnin', that's exorcist
My Audemar like Mardi Gras, that's Swiss time and that's excellence
Two-door preference, roof gone, George Jefferson
That white frost on that pound cake so your Duncan Hines is irrelevant
Woo! Lambo, Murcie-lago
She go wherever I go, wherever we go, we do it pronto

[Interlude: Fuzzy Jones]
Well, it is a weeping and a mourning and a gnashing of teeth in the dancehall
And who no have teeth gwan rub pon them gums
Cause when time it comes to my sound, which is the champion sound
The bugle has blown fi many times, and it still have one more time left
Cause the amount of stripe weh deh pon our shoulder

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Let the suicide doors up
I threw suicides on the tour bus
I threw suicides on the private jet
You know what that mean, I'm fly to death
I step in Def Jam buildin' like I'm the shit
Tell 'em give me fifty million or I'ma quit
Most rappers' taste level ain't at my waist level
Turn up the bass 'til it's up-in-your-face level
Don't do no press but I get the most press kit
Plus, yo, my bitch make your bitch look like Precious
Somethin' 'bout Mary, she gone off that molly
Now the whole party is melted like Dalí
Now everybody is movin' they body
Don't sell me apartment, I'll move in the lobby
Niggas is loiterin' just to feel important
You gon' see lawyers and niggas in Jordans

[Verse 4: 2 Chainz]
Okay, now ketchup to my campaign, coupe the color of mayonnaise
I'm drunk and high at the same time, drinkin' champagne on the airplane (Tell em!)
Spit rounds like the gun range, beat it up like Rampage
Hundred bands, cut your girl, now your girl need a Band-Aid
Grade A, A1, chain the color of Akon
Black diamonds, backpack rhyming, co-signed by Louis Vuitton
Horsepower, horsepower, all this Polo on, I got horsepower
Pound of this cost four thousand, I make it rain, she want more showers
Rain pourin', all my cars is foreign
All my broads is foreign, money tall like Jordan

[Hook]
And I always find, yeah, I always find something wrong
You been putting up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at finding what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast
Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerk-offs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
She find pictures in my e-mail
I sent this bitch a picture of my dick
I don't know what it is with females
But I'm not too good with that shit
See, I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know that's what I'm good at

[Hook]
And I always find, yeah, I always find something wrong

When it starts to get crazy, why can't she just, run away?
Baby, I got a plan, run away fast as you can

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
24/7, 365, pussy stays on my mind
I-I-I-I did it, all right, all right, I admit it
Now pick your next move, you could leave or live wit' it
Ichabod Crane with that motherfucking top off
Split and go where? Back to wearing knockoffs, haha
Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
Hoes like vultures, wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes with a price tag, baby, face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty hoes in the balla-nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless
P!

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage
Cause the look in your eyes is killing me
I guess you are at an advantage
Cause you can blame me for everything
And I don't know how I'mma manage
If one day you just up and leave

[Hook]
And I always find, yeah, I always find something wrong
You been putting up with my shit just way too long

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Fraud niggas, y'all niggas, that's that shit I don't like
Your shit make believe, rapping 'bout my own life
Real names kill things, that's that shit I won't write
Cause my niggas still selling dope like they ain't on their third strikes
Camping out in that corridor, fuck you waiting on Jordans for?
I middle-man it for 23, just meet me somewhere around Baltimore
(Woo!) That's rare nigga, (Woo!) Ric Flair nigga
(Woo!) The power's in my hair nigga, (Woo!) I give this beat the chair nigga
SoHo or Tribeca, three hoes: trifecta
Dope money, coke money, Hublot, my watch better
My pen's better, you don't write, trendsetter, you clone-like
Pay homage or K's vomit – ungrateful niggas, I don't like
Rrrah!

[Hook: Chief Keef]
A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
(This Chicago, nigga!)
They smile in my face is what I don't like
They steal your whole sound, that's a soundbite
The media crucify me like they did Christ
They want to find me not breathing like they found Mike
A girl'll run her mouth only out of spite
But I never hit a woman never in my life
I was in too deep like Mekhi Phife'
In that pussy so deep I could have drowned twice
Rose gold Jesus piece with the brown ice
Eating good, vegetarian with the brown rice
Girls kissing girls, cause it's hot, right?
But unless they use a strap-on then they not dykes
They ain't about that life, they ain't about that life
We hanging out that window it's about to be a Suge night
Free Bump J, real nigga for life
Shoutout to Derrick Rose, man that nigga nice
Shout out to L-E-P, Jay Boogie right?
Chief Keef, King Louie, this is Chi, right? Right?!

[Hook: Chief Keef]
A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like

Don't like, don't like
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like

[Verse 3: Chief Keef]
(Young Chop on the beat)
Fake Gucci, that's that shit that I don't like
Smoking on this dope, higher than a kite
This bitch gon' love me now, she gon' let me pipe
Screaming Sosa, that's that nigga that I like
I don't want relations, I just want one night
Cause a thirsty bitch, that's the shit that I don't like
I got tats up on my arm, cause this shit is life
And I stunt so much in clothes, cause I'm living life
I come up on the scene, and I'm stealing light
Bitch I'm high off life, got me feeling right
Bitch I'm Chief Keef, fuck who don't like
And bitch we GBE, we just go on sight

[Verse 4: Big Sean]
We are not one and the same, nigga I'm fucking insane, fuck is you saying?
Yo ass been doing the same, shit, not doing what you saying
Dang, I told yo old bitch she was fucking a lame, turn one ho to a train
Blaow, blang, my niggas holding that pain, I just hope you been praying
Bang bang! Riding for my niggas and that's for life
High class, I'm just surrounded by these lowlifes
And I run this bitch like it's no lights
Going hard the whole night cause I ain't going back to my old life
I promise

[Hook: Chief Keef]
A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like

[Verse 5: Jadakiss]
I done sold purple, I done sold white
Running outta work, that's that shit I don't like
She never let me hit it, she gave me dome twice
She blowing up my phone, that's that bitch I don't like
Nah, jean jacket with the sleeves cut
Put the pressure on 'em just when they think that I eased up
Thirty for the Cuban, 'nother 30 for the Jesus
Believe in ourselves when nobody else believed us, suckas

[Hook: Chief Keef]

[Bridge: Swizz Beatz]
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Two hands in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, this shit ridiculous
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I'm so appalled, Spalding ball
Balding, Donald Trump taking dollars from y'all
Baby, you're fired, your girlfriend hired
But if you don't mind, I'mma keep you on call
We above the law, we don't give a fuck about y'all
I got dogs that'll chew a fucking hole through the wall
But since they all lovers, I need more rubbers
And if I don't use rubbers, need more covers
Housekeeping, I mean goddamn
One time let it be a bad bitch sweeping
That know we get O's like Cheerios
That know because they seen us in the videos
That know the day that you play me
Would be the same day MTV play videos
That was a little joke, voila
Praises due to the most high, Allah
Praises due to the most fly, Prada
Baby, I'm magic, tada
Address me as your highness, high as United
Thirty-thousand feet up and you are not invited
Niggas be writing bullshit like they gotta work
Niggas is going through real shit, man, they out of work
That's why another goddamn dance track gotta hurt
That's why I'd rather spit something that got a purp'

[Hook]
Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches
I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous
Five star dishes, different exotic fishes
Man this shit is fucking ridiculous

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
How should I begin this? I'm just so offended
How am I even mentioned by all these fucking beginners?
I'm so appalled, I might buy the mall
Just to show niggas how much more I have in store
I'm fresher than you all, so I don't have to pause
All of y'all can suck my balls through my drawers
Dark Knight feeling, die and be a hero
Or live long enough to see yourself become a villain
I went from the favorite to the most hated
But would you rather be underpaid or overrated?
Moral victories is for minor league coaches
And 'Ye already told you we major, you cockroaches
Show me where the boats is, Ferrari Testarossas
And Hammer went broke so you know I'm more focused
I lost 30 mil, so I spent another 30
Cause unlike Hammer, thirty million can't hurt me
Fucking insane, the fuck am I saying?
Not only am I fly, I'm fucking not playing
All these little bitches too big for they britches
Burning they little bridges, fucking ridiculous

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Success is what you make it, take it how it come
A half a mil in twenties like a billion where I'm from
An arrogant drug dealer, the legend I become
CNN said I'd be dead by 21
Blackjack, I just pulled an ace
As you looking at the king in his face
Everything I dream, motherfuckers, I'm watching it take shape
While to you I'm just a young rich nigga that lacks faith
Range Rove, leather roof, love war, fuck a truce
Still move a bird like I'm in bed with Mother Goose
Them hoes coming in a baker's dozen
Claiming they was with me when they know they really wasn't
I keep the city's best, never said she was the brightest
So if you had her too, it don't affect me in the slightest
I never met a bitch that didn't need a little guidance
So I dismiss her past until she disappoints your highness
I speak the gospel, hostile
Tony doing time for what he did to nostrils
Paranoid mind, I'm still under the watchful
Eye of the law, aspire for more
Them kilos came, we gave you Bobby Brown jaw
Flaws ain't flaws when it's you that makes the call
Flow similar to the legends of the falls
Spill it, I own you all, yeah

[Bridge]

[Verse 4: Cyhi The Prynce]
Hah, I am so outrageous
I wear my pride on my sleeve like a bracelet
If God had an iPod, I'd be on his playlist
My phrases amazes the faces in places
The favorite, hah, my cup overrunneth with hundreds
Dummy, damn, it's hard not for me to waste it
The new Commandment: "Thou shalt not hate, kid"
My movement is like the civil rights, I'm Ralph David
Abernathy, so call my lady Rosa Parks
I am nothing like them niggas, baby, those are marks
I met this girl on Valentine's Day, fucked her in May
She found out about April, so she chose to march
Hah, damn another broken heart
I keep bitches by the twos, nigga, Noah's ark
I got a seven on me, I call my 'dro Lamar
Plus a Trojan in my pocket, Matt Leinart
G-A-T in the Pathfinder
Cause you haters got PhDs
Y'all just some major haters and some math minors
Tiger Woods, don't make me grab iron

[Hook: RZA]
Ayo, champagne wishes and thirty white bitches
You know the shit is fucking ridiculous
Cars for the missus and furs for the mistress
You know that shit is fucking ridiculous

Aye move that dope, aye move that dope
Young nigga move that dope
Young nigga, young nigga move that dope
Young nigga move that dope
Aye move that dope, Aye move that dope
Young nigga move that dope

[Verse 1: Future]
Whippin' the yam, whippin and flippin' the yam
Turn the whole brick to a Lam
Re-rockin' the dope, soon as it get off the boat
Keepin' it soft like a mink
Gold on my link, coke in the sink
Choppin' that work like karate
Servin' a new Maserati, in a brand new Maserati
That's a whole lot of new money
Snatch it, then hide it from the 12
Movin' them squares and them bales, servin' the rawest of yayo
Beating that china like Kunta Kinte
Whippin' it, whippin' that fish and Parkay
Drinkin' on syrup, I'm rollin' up haze
Made myself a boss, a boss and a plug
Either way you put it, nigga, I'm good
Triple salute, nigga, straight out the hood
Bakin' soda water splash the scales
Fork in my right and my pot in my left
Leanin' all the way over to the side, I whip me a four way to a nine
The dirty, the money is homicide and my recipe can't be televised

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Young enough to still sell dope, but old enough that I knows better
When they sayin' it's 42 for that white powder, I knows better
Get it nigga? I nose better, put a smile on the devil's face
Who don't wanna sell dope forever and flood their Rollie 'till the bezel break?
Woo! Fish scale in the two-door that I fish-tails
Fiberglass, Ferrari leather, in designer shit that I misspell
YUGHH! Look at the clues, the J's, the jewels, I'm actin' a monkey
From sixteen years old, I'm whippin' in kitchens, fuckin' my junkies
Pablo, Versace way before Migos
My dinner plates, no silverware, all you niggas my hijos
Toss a kilo like a free throw, crack house, it had the peephole
Made it through to the other side, now nothing's big as my ego, Push

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Pharrell]
Me, I try to leave the best for later
But Pusha tried to put me on the respirator
The old Skateboard P, that's your favorite
Me and twenty girls doin' yoga naked
Frequency high, like a spaceship
She say that she like it and she's been exposed
The Gandalf hat and the weird ass clothes
That's Comme des Garçons and the Buffalo
I know guerrillas with the triggers that's on a banana clip
And packin' with the biggest missiles
These niggas is knocking over vehicles
These niggas ain't waitin' just to see niggas
These niggas ain't tryna hear plea niggas
These niggas like choppin' down trees, niggas
These niggas 1-2-3 and they squeeze, niggas
These niggas hit the weed then they lean niggas, gee, nigga
If you got two hoes, you need to let one go
Two Lambos, you need to let one go
All these drones while y'all smoke dro
There's an eye in the sky, I'm tryna let y'all know
Ain't no standards, I'ma set one though
Big ass bag but no man sandals
All that war, we need to let that go
That boom business, I'ma get that ho

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Casino]
Young nigga got that coke, whip that dope like a bad child
How you think about that coupe, with no roof? Young nigga cashed out
Popped so many Percs, popped so many Zans, young nigga 'bout to pass out
12 jump behind me, I got some in the car, young nigga 'bout to smash out
Migo hit that line, say he got some bricks, young fresh, 'bout to buy 'em out
QuikTrip 'round the corner, dropped a nine
Got the J's in the lunch line smokin' iron
Cocaine, cocaine cowboy, like Mickey Munday
Take over the project, whip a line, me no wait
I keep a 45 in my coat, while I'm servin' dope
The J's in my hood smoke that crack, say it give 'em hope
Serve a nigga whole brick, he hopin' that it come and go
Young nigga tricked up, now he spendin' that money with Casino!

Outlaw, outlaw, like I hit the PowerBall
Once all eyes is on me, floating off like Southpaw
Niggas love to count yours, hoping that your people fall
Wishing death upon me, but I'm here forevermore
I just get debated on, I just get my greatest on
Saint Laurent on speed dial, I just put the latest on
Bring it on, bring it on, you want more, then bring it on

Re-Up Gang Pusha
(Looking for trouble, trouble, trouble)
But you found it, mutherfucker

All I see is black roses, drug dealer poses
Shoveling that devil’s angel up they noses
Never let jail turn my Shyne into Moses
Couldn’t cleanse my soul with them Civil Rights hoses
Panoramic roof, under glass like a coaster
Backseat driver, racial slurs at the chauffeur
Killian loafers, Mikimoto chokes her
Photo-op is priceless, frame our wanted posters
The Audacity, war brings casualty
Bitch have my son before I face that tragedy
I order hits, she orders mahi
R.I.P. Vivian Blake, shout out the Shower Posse
Gone

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
(You seek out problems)
(Looking for trouble)
But you found it, motherfucker

I miss the misogyny, bad bitches massagin' me
Sometimes we lowered our standards at the colleges
So please don’t judge me, uh, for the followin’:
Fat bitches swallowin', skinny bitches modelin’
Take off that Givenchy and let’s get raunchy
I have your face looking all Captain Crunchy
The devil stay testing, ’cause when you chase the pussy it’s a sin
But if it falls in your lap, it’s a blessin'
Soon as I got salad, I spent it all on dressin'
French, to be exact, that Balmain was impressive
Hedi Slimane leathers

[Verse 3: Cyhi The Prynce]
(Cyhi! Yeah!)

Boy, we lookin’ for trouble
Maybe if we wasn’t black, then we wouldn’t have struggled
Player, all I got is trap niggas and crooks in my huddle
They cook and I smuggle, got twenty pounds of kush in the duffle
So I’m runnin’ through them circles, boy, I’m looking like Knuckles
Look at my knuckles, got the hook in ’cause niggas was looking
I’ve tooken some whoopings, so trust me, dog, I’m good for a scuffle
Don’t be mad I whooped your ass, ’cause I’ve tooken a couple
Feds askin' niggas questions, but I wouldn’t rebuttal
‘cause I’m Jake Gyllenhaal, I’m in the hood with the bubble
With a tall model broad like I took her from Russell
Didn’t play the cards I was dealt, I made the dealer re-shuffle
Royal Flush, so kiss my royal nuts
Ain’t nothin’ silver spooned, I came from the soil, bruh
But now I’m eatin’ off of Raffaello Gold
Exquisite ravioli with some happy yellow hoes
But don’t get it confused when I rap these mellow flows
‘Cause all my Titos got bricks like the yellow road

[Verse 4: Big Sean]
G.O.O.D., I do it, B.I.G. Sean Don, nigga
But you found it motherfucker

I’m, in, that no-smoke sec rolling motherfucking ounces
Marijuana mountains, drinks you’re not pronouncing
Three chains on, I don’t need no bouncers
Nothing less than a G-stack’s in my trousers
New Double D's smashed in her blouses
Fuck a hotel, my nigga we rent houses (houses)
My nigga, we rent houses
So many wedding rings lost in them couches
I’m just a Westside lover
I leave females in my sheets and all my feelings in a rubber
This is showtime, showtime, boy, I hope you set the DVR
Stacking money face to face, this shit look like CPR
‘Ye invited me a seat to sit at the throne
So now I’m snappin’ like yo’ ass just finished a poem
Does he sound like 'Ye, Jay, or Drizzy Drake?
Meanwhile, I’m chillin’ with all these niggas, counting all this money you ain’t
Consider yourself lucky to see a legend before the prime
A killer before the crime, a B.I.G. before the dyin'
Greet me wit’ a middle finger when you see me
It’s cool, ’cause I can’t see yo’ ass from this side of the TV, mutherfucker!

[Verse 5: J. Cole]
Hey, Cole World, make way for the chosen one
What you now hear is puttin’ fear in all the older ones
Downplayed me to downgrade me like they don’t notice son
Your shoes too big too fill? I can barely squeeze my toes in ‘em
Fucking hoes while teachin' niggas to hold your sons
This the rap Moses, scratch that, Mary and Joseph’s son
High as fuck with a cold flow and a loaded gun
Never say I’m better than Hov', but I’m the closest one
Heard you lookin’ for trouble, what, I’m ‘sposed to run?
Yo’ bitch invited me inside her, ain’t I supposed to come?
Got niggas that’ll blow your tee off, put a hole in one
Now you outside of Heaven’s gate, frontin’ like you know someone
Talking hard, but y’all still ain’t push me
They say you are what you eat, and I still ain’t pussy
Fuck it, e’rybody can get it
When you’re this hot, e'rybody’s a critic
But when you’re this high e'rybody’s a midget
All this mean mugging from niggas that mean nothin'
Could it be my position is one that you dreamed of?
Went from quarter to broke to half past rich
With my badass bitch
And you don’t want no problems on some math class shit
So check the young genius out
Fuck the world, bust a nut, and let my semen sprout
I thought that real shit is what you been fiendin' ’bout
What you been praying fo’? What you been screamin' ’bout?
Ironic you been sleeping on the one that you been dreamin' ’bout[Hook]
100, 100, 100, 100 (x8)
You know I keep it (x4)

[Pusha T]
My life is but a dream pullin' cars up
Told you motherfuckers keys open doors up
Never excited when I'm seen with something gorgeous
Put highway miles on these bitches like a tour bus
Daddy Warbucks, without a born trust
Diamonds all on this black gold like an oil rush
The highest quality, the chains are all flush
Known Jacob since the nineties so he spoils us
Stock spoilers, no kits on 'em
Why Panamera, nine-eleve shits on 'em
Chuck the deuce as I Tokyo drift on 'em
The top drops like this Bangladesh heat on 'em

[Hook]
100, 100, 100, 100, you never keep it (x4)

[Jadakiss]
Yo, get yourself a hundred years tryin' to be the boss
Stand next to the chandeliers, you could see the shards
Ain't no diamonds in the watch, but you see the cross
When you spoon feed them that dope they need it more
All night, sweet sales
Four pipes, V twelves
Yeah, you know what them grams do
Bad bitch with me that the industry ain't ran through
Na, I ain't stop hustling yet, but I plan to
Own a bunch of vehicles and a bunch of land too
Yeah and I love it when the rush come
Ain't no secret that I keep it ninety-nine plus one

[Hook x2]
100, 100, 100, 100, you know I keep it
100, 100, 100, 100, you never keep it

[Mr. Bangladesh]
Y'all niggas fifty-fifty I keep it a hundred
I spit the truth in interviews, I keep it one hundred
I'm the shit, smell the fumes, my nigga we plungin'
And the 808s on a leash, they say it's a monster
Got my own label, fucked around and signed myself
Had a plan and stuck to it, you fuckboys is stuck boy
Bangladesh new shit ropin' like a cowboy
On my Tony Romo shit, you niggas just some towel boys
Tell the whole world to suck my cockiness
My checks eight figures like a octopus
Three hundred thou for the watch and rocky shit
These other niggas fakin' and I ain't afraid to say I keep it

[Hook x2]

[2 Chainz]
A hundred miles and running, nigga with an attitude
Bitch I'm so fly, you should check the altitude
I'm ballin', ballin' like an alley-oop
My girl heel so high she need a parachute
Get 'em, I got 'em let me at 'em
My condo on Jupiter, my neighbors on Saturn
Murcielago, flow with some eye candy
I go to trial Monday, I been takin' panties
Hundred degrees in the mic booth
I'm from where you put golds on the white tooth
And when you walk in and she might look
Might get took, might get fucked
A bunch of bitches in the skip line
I'm known to get mine ten out of ten times
I paid a hundred thousand for the old school
Known to keep it one hundred on the Pro Tools

[Hook x2][Hook: Big Sean]
I'm from a big city, trying to make a living
Come to my hood, everybody get it
And for that paper all the wrong things sound right
Where I'm from they push 100 keys and it sound like
Where I'm from they push 100 keys and it sound like
Young niggas getting money, young niggas getting money
Just a bittersweet symphony

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I play the keys, handle dope, Barry Manilow
The game a bitch, but at times she sweet like cantaloupe
Hit the road, key of coke in the manifold
Triple beam dreams with a trunk full of scattered clothes
Japanese denim, down south numbers
Hit it once, trust it'll make a fat fiend stumble
Do the speed limit, Argo shoes
Call 'em penny loafers, they a pretty penny too
I'm tippin' strippers but I call it penny pinchin'
She talkin' shit but I can get her titties lifted
My new crib got its own city limit
Motherfucker got his own city in it
Blue marble on the floor, wet as salt water
Underboss I'll just play the holes like a golf course

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
One hundred keys, one hundred please
My gesundheit could make a whole city sneeze
Walked the mud jungle where they grinded out the leaves
So they swarm to my honey comb, hideout for the bees
You know what this sound like, money counters' sound bites
Machine gun fire, name ringin' through the town like
Church bells ringin', know what he was found like?
Colombian necktie over hospital gown white
She live on her knees, I live in a condo in the trees
The air's a little thinner that I breathe
The Iron Man Audi, let the top striptease
My life's in slow motion, but the watch screamin' freeze
Ugh, young nigga gettin' money
The feds' dragnet couldn't take nothin' from me
The decoy car is a crash test dummy
What follows is a hundred of 'em, wrapped like a mummy

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
B.I., boi
And they gon' risk a hundred lives
So they could rock a hundred whites
Baguettes lookin' like a hundred lights
Man when Blade died my city cried a hundred nights
Yeah I got a main girl, but I done hit a hundred tight
Every wrong I do I'm steady tryna do a hundred rights
Got her for cheap, compare the price
My nigga keep that low key, Barry White
And don't worry 'bout the info
From where they rob Pintos and could afford Enzos
Cause everybody knows keys open doors, but bricks open windows
Counting a hundred hundreds, more by more
Built this from the tile up, floor by floor
Talk shit, I'll send 'em door by door
Made for the Snow White like 4 by 4s

Trouble world, trouble child
Trouble times destroyed my smile
No change of heart, no change of mind
You can take what's yours but you gon' leave what's mine
I'd rather die, than go home
I'd rather die, than go home
And I ain't leaving without my 40 acres

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Unpolished, unapologetic
This cocaine cowboy pushed it to the limit
You thought Tony in that cell would've made us timid
We found his old cell, bitch, we searchin' through the digits
Anything Spanish, got me speaking Spanglish
Money universal, that's the only language
The dream ain't die, only some real niggas
We was born to mothers who couldn't deal with us
Left by fathers who wouldn't build with us
I had both mine home, let's keep it real niggas
My better half chose the better path, applaud him
Younger brother me a spoiled child, I fought him
I heard that the Devil's new playground is boredom
The California top just falls back like autumn
And they say I'm on the verge of winning
I claim victory when Malice on the verge of sinning
Old habits die hard
That rainy day bag buried in the backyard
It's heaven for a hustler, no graveyards
Cause stand up niggas don't lie on no floors
Much rather burn us, ashes to ashes
Mix us with the powder, sell us to the masses
We gon' keep it tight, rip it off the plastic
Now you celebrate motherfuckers raise your glasses
Push...

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Unpolished, unapologetic
Might have broke a heart or two but gave an honest effort
My nonchalant attitude is always eff it
35 years of marriage and my momma left it
You shouldn't question if you ever stood a chance with him
The better question is did you enjoy the dance with him
(Yughh!) I'll probably never pull you chair out, bitch
You know this money grew your hair out, switch
All that shit I bought you wear out
Rich, and I'm the only one I care about
Place none above me, God don't like ugly
Hate me or love me, only he can judge me
Unpolished, unapologetic
Big willie with the blow, niggas, I am legend
School of hard knock, I attended
Selling hard rock, fuck who I offended
I was a goner, punished by karma
Called him tar baby now he’s transcending genres
The 911 came with the ass shots
A toothless crackhead was the mascot
The owner of the key to that padlock
I’m Jordan vs Cavs for the last shot
I need all mine, reparations
We growin' poppy seeds on my 40 acres
Push!

[Hook][Bridge: Lantana]
All I ever wanted, was some money get some money
All I ever wanted, was some money get some money
Turn a dollar to 20, 20 to a fifty, fifty to a band
Hold up, wait, I'm going in

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
All white phantom like it come off the boat
Street money yeah I come from the dope
I voted for Obama, he was talking that hope
And I don't fuck with homie cause he saving the ho
It's all hustle no luck, I come up off your plugs
I want thirty for a bird, 22 for a duck
A duck a fake bird, mean it mix with that cut
You quacking ass niggas, need to shut the fuck up
I tell em: All muscle, no pussy
The plug bless me, straight kush, I had loud in the trap
Snow in the summer, I made millions in the South, work
Self made, like Ross and them
It's CMG and everybody bosses here
Money getting made, niggas getting paid
Fuck your gun license nigga we pluck with them K's

[Hook: Lantana]
4 in the morning I ain't seen my bed
Yeah all hustle no luck
Balling so hard that my phone went dead
Damn I just fucked my power ball up
Uh, All hustle no luck, Uh, All hustle no luck
Uh, All hustle no luck
Is that, is that all hustle, no luck, I bet I get me rich dawg

[Verse 2: Lantana]
Lantana!
Here, they done let me out
I ain't going back then let me in can't get me out my grind hard
Phone charged, man made, nigga fack y'all!
I bet I get me rich bitch, on that all hustle no luck yeah
(all hustle, no luck)
Do this shit with my eyes closed see me I'm in grind mode
Different day but the same clothes
Fuck it nigga I'm payed though
Crazy nigga on the case low
Hundred nigga eat a bank roll
Do the shit if I say so, today though
Cincinnati since my mama had me
I change my city with one song look how I made it happen
Uh, I still ain't seen my bed
I've been hustling like a ese all this money in my head

[Hook: Lantana]
4 in the morning I ain't seen my bed
Yeah all hustle no luck
Balling so hard that my phone went dead
Damn I just fucked my ball up
Uh, All hustle no luck, Uh, All hustle no luck
Uh, All hustle no luck
Is that, is that all hustle, no luck, I bet I get me rich dawg

[Verse 3: Bun B]
Trill OG, Bun B yeah that's the name
It's UGK for life homie that's the game
These boys wanna take me off my feet, but that's the thang
They know that I'm packing that I ain't scared to cock it back and bang
I'm riding round on them fo's and vogues and they clack and swang
Yeah you sittin' on 22's but they factory mane
You're trying to be like me, you see but the fact remain
For me it's easy to offer protection bro its a natural thing
Pulled out, show it up, suicide doored up
Smoked out and they pour it up, if I came down then it slow it up
Like oh man, hold up, PA get throwed up
That's Lantana they can't stand us, it's all hustle no luck

[Verse 4: Pusha T]
(4 in the morning I ain't seen my bed)
All I ever wanted was the money and the cars
Bag full of dope and a pretty ass broad
Never did I think about the time or the charge
I was busy worrying bout buying out the bar
I was busy flying out linking up with Czar
When you all got money, it's hard pointing out the star
When them dollars fall, them hoes start to follow
We just seat back and gloat cause we got 'em
He want war, it's on sight when I spot 'em
Can't do haters, head shots when I dot 'em
Yeah, it's all hustle, no luck
Get this money and we ain't giving no fucks

[Hook: Lantana]
Uh, All hustle no luck, Uh, All hustle no luck
Uh, All hustle no luck
Is that, is that all hustle, no luck, I bet I get me rich dawg[Produced by Nottz]

[Verse 1]
I let you into my diary to admire me
The make up of this man, I let you see the higher me
The self righteous drug dealer dichotomy
I'm drawing from both sides, I am Siamese
The tug of war opens the door, entrada
Rip me apart and see what's inside of this piñata
And rolling kilos in Gymstrada that's one saga
One chapter of black magic, I'm Harold Potter
Feels like I'm doomed to dealing with women who
Relationships with their fathers won't allow us to bloom
And blossom, I swear them Vegas nights was fucking awesome
But adiós I blow my own dice before I toss 'em
Lost some niggas some other niggas double crossed 'em
Tryna snatch my niggas back I blew a small fortune
Wrestle with the work, we was like the four horsemen
Rick Flair with the flame, I'm motherfucking Gorgeous
As the gull wing doors lift
Karate Kid, crane kick, no Jaden Smith
Whiter than that coke brush that they paint me with
Sunk leather seats softer than an angel's kiss
But they devil red, tires double tread
I post and parks up, that gets me double head
Tight rope walking tryna keep a level head
The bright lights blind look at what the devil did

[Hook]
She left the door open gave a fuck if I'm famous
I write this alone in Vegas
Came off fly street money partied nights with the a-list
I write this alone in Vegas
Remember nights when my team blew it all on the tables
I write this alone in Vegas
I'm the only one left and the memories fading so
I write this alone in Vegas

[Verse 2]
They'll do everything in their power
Stomp near the stove when you're rising like flour
Make your cake fall when you threatening their tower
It's 911 you're on your 25th hour
Hasta la vista I'm steppin' out the bleachers
How the tide turns when the pupil's now the teacher
The game can't grow by just followin' the leaders
You gotta be better than the ones who precede, yeah
Upgrade them, upstage them
Change the whole body shape and just update them, Pagans
Reagan era I ran contraband
Money caused turf wars through the promised land
First time being rich could be a common man
The Guy Fishers had the blueprints and diagrams
We just took what we needed and we built on it
Lord forgive me for the blood that I spilt on it

[Hook]

[Outro]
Fear of God niggas, got me feelin' like Pac
This the realest shit I ever wrote
Who you know sit in New York for 2 days around Grammy winners
Come back home straight to the money getters
About $14,000 dollars worth in 20s
Brown paper bag money, I call that a good weekend
Re-up gang forever
Long live the caine coming soon
Malice my brother I love you
Liva Don 'til the end nigga[Produced by Shawty Redd]

[Intro: Young Jeezy]
In the midst of negativity
A positive sight can be blurred
And the visions that we thought were good
Seems to let evil occur
While still possessing our human form
We live life searching for greatness since the day we was born
And as we bow our heads at night, rich, wealthy
Or poor with dislike, we pray, asking for
Forgiveness for our sinful ways
With mind, body, spirit and faith, we pray amen

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
You like that don’t you? I wrote it myself by the way
And I don’t mean to be selfish
But I picture myself getting paid
And you might catch pneumonia
Cause I'm colder than a elf on a sleigh
Me and Pusha back on it
Now everybody help us pray
Lord forgive my sins and all my friends
Dollars make sense, I’m trying to get paid

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Try to get saved (too late!)
Time to get paid
Got a gun and a stocking mask
Niggas thought I was trying to get waves
I’mma let all ya’ll niggas pray for it
My young niggas knocking off a K for it
Sold my soul on the back-end
Only fucking way I’mma pay for it
Front that shit, you put a flame on
My niggas locked in a cage for
They keep telling me to go hard
#1 spot you was made for
I made more
Front of the grill, got a racehorse
California Crayola red
Glow In The Dark like a Ye tour
Fuck niggas stepping in my lane for
Not knowing that it’s a land mine
Soon as a nigga feels a cool breeze
Throw the top up like a gang sign
Red or blue? Crip or Blood?
Solitaires, diamond studs like chandeliers I’mma flood
Black Jesus piece like it’s dipped in mud
Fashion God’s, notice mine
Rollerball spikes, I’m Pokémon
Paris shit, Louboutin
Under bright lights where do you belong

[Hook: Young Jeezy]
Please Lord, yeah, it’s gettin realer everyday
Niggas killin’, niggas starving, niggas they can’t find no Yay
See at first they roll around and their bills they cannot pay
So some be trappin' and some be dying, bow heads and let us pray
Amen

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Amen, how many people do you know hatin’?
On your downfall sitting their waitin’
When you shine, don't know what they gonna say then
Everything I do now stadiums
Tell me what they really gon’ say to him
And I’m headed straight to the ATM
Finna go HAM, nigga, finna go in
Nigga you get it when pigs fly
When Yeezy fake, Devil’s pie
Piece of cake, Kit-Kat
I need a break, God’s child
Jesus Christ, Club like a broken neck
I need the ice, I need the lights
In Egypt they fightin’ for freedom
Cop pull you over no reason, beat him

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Young Jeezy]
I got them units packed in
That black van like the A-Team
Even seen them come 2-tone like a saleen
Saleen, Yeah that’s a Mustang
Break ‘em down in the night, thats what I call hustling
They say they want that dumb shit, well this is ignorant
Condo on the timepiece, now thats ignorant
Young, you a fool, I coulda bought some real estate
Instead I bought a half a block, I tried to sew up half the streets
I’m on, 75-75, going for the 25
Guess who’s pickin’ up a trey
Just an ordinary day with extraodinary pay
Extraordinary risk
Can’t even explain, got an extraordinary wrist
I talk it cause I lived it man, this shit ain't really nothin' to me
Tell ya like Sosa told Tony, “Don't you fuck with me”

[Hook][Intro]
Arrange my books in order
Make up some nice stories to amuse you
Make things look smart and easy
Shape up the place, hungry for the

[Hook]
And if I found a thousand pounds, a thousand pounds (3x)

[Verse 1: Pill]
If I was privilidged enough find one thousand of that loud pack
Distribute it to trusted partners just so they can bounce back
Like juvie though, that's a thousand niggas say they knew me though
Random text messages just flexin on how they knew before the work came
That I would be a standout like a search stain
Pocket full of paper from prophet after the percaine
The first game, that I learned to play was that Tetris
Find a block filled em in and cash out on a necklace
He neckless, if he preachin' some wild shit, foul shit
Two shots now I'm sittin' in cells on some Green Mile shit
Perfect this, hustlin' rationed bustas left with some lacerations
Pounds that I've found I yawned feel like my luck awakened
We bluntin', a hundred times ten got me in
Came up and I would be a damn fool not to win
We bluntin', a hundred times ten got me in
Came up and I would be a damn fool not to win
Ok denn

[Chrous]

[Verse 2: CyHi Da Prynce]
If I ever touched a thousand I would front a bag to every hustler in public housing
All these fuckin' pounds and I would never touch a falcon
Call up my battalion tell em'that I got them brussel frostin'
Go buy some rifles for them cowards that be wylin'
Tryna' run up on us, hold that bitch up like a violin
Get hit once from the big pump, you flip punk
About my chips chump, I'm a chipmunk like Alvin
Uh, then I'm back to puffing loud and
Eyes cut lower than a Kung Fu master from Shaolin
Then I fuck a stallion in my medallion
On an island drinkin wine, cuttin' salmon
Hit the club, make a movie Robert Townsend
The way these diamonds shinin' in the ring throw the towel in
Smilin', thumbin' through this cash that I'm pilin'
Singing this Soprano man I feel like I'm Italian
WHAT

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Yuh, first thousand pounds nigga thought he hit the jackpot
Club polaroid pic, Benz symbol backdrop
Bent over redbone, she was just a mascot
Money fan can't cool you off when you that hot
Next stop car lot, Coupe wit the bald spot
Maseratti grill like a pit when the jaws locked
Malls shop a few hours took two showers
These two bitches goin' down like the Two Towers
Too sour you can see it in a hater's face
True cowards so I keep you in a hater's place
Drop them numbers on the pounds just to make em' 'scape
Weed the fake hustlers out I'm just makin' space
These niggas talk a good game I just make the cake
Niggas dying over here I just make the wake
Been seeing a thousand pounds I just scrapped the plate
For all the money that I stashed they ain't made a safe[Intro]
Haha, yeah
How y'all doing out there? (Alright, alright)
Thank you for joining me this evening
How y'all feel?

 [Hook]
Like I feel so awesome
How you feel? Awesome, I guess that's awesome
Shawty you fine and your body is awesome
Wanna roll? Awesome, well let's go, awesome
Hands in the sky like…

[Verse 1: XV]
I’m A-W-E, some call me awesome
Some call me Vizzy, hunnies call me often
Gator on my shirt, what did it Lacoste him?
Jesus Christ I'm good, please don't cross him
How rude, Stephanie Tanner
You don't gotta watch me but please watch your manners
And I be getting green, so mean, Bruce Banner
Gifted flow and presence, man I’m the new Santa
And uh, I’m saying Kansas where I’m staying
Where niggas be bang-bangin' like Pops on the Wayans
And even through the hating in walls they thought I stay in
Psh, who you playing? I done went Super Saiyan
This that off the glass, off the floor, off the board jam
We in the building, you wishing you had the floor plans
You just a door, man, door man, damn, I wish I had more hands

[Pre-Hook]
Now tell me what got two thumbs and knows how to spit rhymes?
Two thumbs up, you gon point 'em at this guy
Al Hedison couldn't be this fly so ask how I feel and you know I reply…

[Hook]
Like I feel so awesome
How you feel? Awesome, I guess that's awesome
Shawty you fine and your body is awesome
Wanna roll? Awesome, well let's go, awesome
Hands in the sky like…

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
This is history in the making, ain’t you feeling it?
Thief flow, they say I’m on some show stealing shit
My solo discography, I’m building it
Now every time you hit the space bar, I'm killing it
Yeah, I’m so fucking awesome, 200,000 was paid to out-floss ‘em
They don’t wanna follow my lead, I gotta force ‘em
To keep the competition in line, you gotta sort them
Fire engine red in that drop head
Haters drop dead when I’m in that bobsled
Cover girl on my side and she bobs head
Saying yes to my denim as she nods head
XV from the middle of the map
I’m coming to you live from the middle of the trap
Colors in the chain likes Skittles out the pack
The hustler, teaming with the gentleman of rap
Let's go

Ay, I'm awesome, every time I lay it down
I think that I kill 'em, play possum
Death proof, ride around with Rosario Dawson
Tell 'em open wide when they see how I'm flossing (ching)
Cooler than a peppermint, Wayne's World excellent Party on Garth (shwing)
Work ethic harder than a Mexican
That's why I can walk up into any restaurant and close the whole thing
See? Even G couldn't F with it
Semi-colon, dash, parenthese, text message it
That's a side smiley face ‘cause I'mma make the best of it
I assume you should make room for the elephant
Boom, where I come from is irrelevant ‘cause my glory is all that I revel in
And my story begins where most others end
So all I really got to tell ‘em is…

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook] (x2)[Kanye West]
Uh, G.O.O.D. Music, this our year
Backing drums by DJ Premier
Now let me count it down, who the fuck up in here?
Common, Don, Old G, battle rap, oh
Y'all niggas know you can’t really fuck with that
Pusha T, the Clipse just made a classic
Good music together we too Jurassic, you stay plastic
Ramadan with the flow, guaranteed everybody fasting
Big Sean is a don
CyHi Da Prynce
Why you so nervous dog stop being tense
If you ain't talking bout Rash we ain't got nothing in common
Fuck that and that's just common sense what the

[Pusha T]
Came in the game, 8 years prior
8 years later, your mans on fire
My Book of Eli, to all my subscribers
Play the two doors, street car named desire
Came in Grindin’, Ye’ came through the wire
Met at the crossroads, Bone Thugs inspired
1st of the month, Trump to the buyers
Red toupee on the coupe you been fired
Smooth criminal, no prior’s
Man in the mirror, check no liar
Still let that butter fly like Mariah
Show me the money the black Jerry McGuire
Tom Cruise on that couch if that money right
West Hollywood feels like a bunny night
With GOOD company and better jewelers
To the Good Life, we GOOD music

[Big Sean]
Man, I wake up to a wet dream
Every day’s a Friday and every nights a sex scene
Every week is fashion week and every day I’m pressed clean
Detroit’s angel, I even got red wings
I’m headed to the ball, me and three prom queens
My life’s prom night and guess who’s the Prom King
They having a kissing fight and I’m Don King
Everybody know I’m coming soon like LeBron’s ring
I’m Big L, Notorious, Big Pun, Shawn Carter, Sean Combs and Connery all in one
Whoever told you sky’s the limit is looking dumb
Cause I’m 22 and I’m moonwalking on the sun
Oh thats your girl?
She feelin on my whoo there right next to a couple boaters
And she tryna motor boat her and im coming from the w-w-westside of the Motor
You might find banana clips ’cause it’s Guerilla warfare
Last year I was watching this from the couch and now I’m here
Thats to let you know what I’m about
Reaper black suit cuz my whole team’s killin'
Had to keep setting trends cuz your whole team stealin'
Many tell me I’m the man I ain't made it yet
Tell me who the baddest, I’ll see if I see them naked yet
Won’t stop til I get that Mercedes 700 CLK and Mercedes ain't made it yet

[Cyhi Da Prince]
I’m Mr. Got Bread like Quizno’s
Better known as MJ with the big nose
I swear your artist couldn’t see me on his tip toes
Only on TV I gotta take a quick pose
Let me stop I forgot this was a big show
If being dope made you broke I am piss poor
I’m big poppa plus I’m 2pacalypto
My mind is a weapon what I need to pop a clip for?
Huh, I’m doing this for hip hop
I'm coming after you, him and his spot!
Still tied to the streets like a fish knot
Ain't nothing fake, I’m not a Rolly with a tick tock
Atlanta repper in the home of the yankee
Rosewood suit on with the hanky
I got rich from the zones of the stanky
So everybody know my money long, lanky!
So I’m flexible stretching out my decimals
Switching up the flow got the crowd going testicles
Can’t bleep it out cuz there wasn’t nothing sexual
I’m blowing loud, somebody check the decibels
I’m impeccable they put me on the pedestal
And if you bite me, it’s good for you like a vegetable
Shows by the several, schedule full of festivals
And if I ever do time than you know its federal
Uh, incredible, yeah

[Common]
F-f-f-fam fam fam I’ma monster too
You don’t see I do things that the monsters do
The incomparable, remarkable, articles
About my audible technique, my technique
I recognize game like the ESPY’s
Cold to myself I say "God bless me" the truth
So I speak live and directly
You, I will set free my mic is where my check be
Rah, I echo, I echo, I echo, the sounds of the ghetto, future of the retro
Prolly in the metro just so I can get dough
The name is Common but the frame is special
Leave requested from the years I’ve invested
Arrested, develop, addressed it, envelope
The body of the black party from Farley to Bob Marley
Go home or go hard, at home is life hardly

[Kanye West]
The plan was to drink till the pain over
What’s worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air rolling down the window
Too many urkels on your team thats why your Winslow
I sold my soul to the devil that's a crappy deal
Least it came with a few toys like a happy meal
This game you could never win
Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again
Get away from me lonliness
Get away from me misery
Get away from me fake shit, I can’t take the phoniness
Get away from me wack tracks
I can only make only hits
I’m an only child lost in the world
Where did the lonely kids go when the bell ring
Feeling like hell rings
Bringing me back down
Checking my background
Its ironic whats happening
Imagine if I didn’t have the ends
I wouldn't have so many imaginary friends
I’m spaced out Dog, I be on that Moon talk
Wonder if God asked Mike how to moon walk
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more
I stopped visitin around the time I was a sophomore
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him
And I ain't finna change, so we’ll never agree again
Just a few things pouring out my soul
Rosewood we could see her with our eyes closed[Intro: Gunplay]
I just beat a life sentence nigga
Fuck ya'
I just beat a life sentence nigga
Fuck ya'
Bet that
Bet that
Bet that

[Hook: Gunplay] x2
I don't give a fuck about ya, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck about ya, I don't give a fuck
And you can bet that, and you can bet that
You understand?

[Verse 1: Gunplay]
No love for a pussy nigga
No love for the pussy neither
Holler fuck 'em, hope you quit your breathing
I don't gotta make believe, I make believers
This ratchet patching nigga head up something decent
Fuck a precinct and that whip you leasing
My nigga my new stick come equipped with features
And that whole dome come equipped with bleachers, so what's the play?
Spend a stack and whack a nigga bout some loose change
That's the way I act and how I do things
I'm thugging all the time, ain't a mood swing
I'm a human cocaine shoestring

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Gunplay]
These busters been boofs
Full of shit, actin' full clip proof
I don't give a fuck 'bout who you kin to
I got uncles, I got homies in the pen too
My patience wear thin too
I don't give a fuck about you, nothing bout ya
Bitches bring me money that they snuck up out ya
Then tell me, daddy it's just something bout ya
I tell her I don't doubt ya, I'm like nothing outchea
Busting when I wasn't, now the haters hover like
Buzzards over desert, everything I do I gotta overdose to measure
Oh, lord
Look who came to visit, the new O-Dog

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
I don't give a fuck who you are, so fuck who you are
Shout out to Styles P, that's like the hardest fucking bar
I don't give a fuck if you the next rising star
Get star struck and get hit with this A.R
A double M. O., fuck what you saying
Get played like a demo, niggas know my M.O
Money over bitches, God over all
Birthed you little niggas, watched you all crawl
Leanin' on them bricks still, Michael Off the Wall (Hee-hee!)
Don't stop till you get enough of that raw
All we is is get money, running from the law
Think you don't give a fuck? Shit I'mma raise the bar

[Hook][Joke - Couplet 1]
Mes négros sont dans la place comme Rosa Parks
J'ai l'génie, la taille, la nation d'Bonaparte
Nique sa mère le rap, vive les chattes, les black cards
Ils veulent nous voir souffrir comme eux tous ces bâtards
Ma mine et moi on taff d'arrache pied
Comme Vania on veut l'million en fourrant toutes ces tasses-pé
Là j'ai océan d'billets c'est c'que j'appelle brasser
Marie-toi à la rue t'auras pas de bague, t'auras le bracelet, nigga
Konichiwa, Namasté, Dieu merci j'ai pas d'paparazzi
J'peux prendre le thé ou m'faire sucer sur ma rasse-té
Rien qu'ta gueule elle fout l'seum
Ma chérie tu sais que ma ueue-q va pas se sucer toute seule
Tu pourras t'lever à 7 heures, ou à 5 heures
L'avenir appartient qu'à un seul négro dans l'secteur
Baise la fille, la mère, la sœur d'cet enculé d'inspecteur
Tu fais l'gars chaud jusqu'à c'que tu prennes un coup d'extincteur

[Pusha T - Couplet 2]
Flow killer, no nigga fuckin' with the boy
Album of the year, dope dealers jump for joy
Inspired as they're paddle shifting in their foreign toys
Listenin' to the realest nigga makin' all the noise
My name is my name, 'cain is to blame
Slave to the kilo, the chain still remains
Yuugh, the G.O.O.D. Music kingpin
Window of opportunity is really shrinkin'
Trigger finger steady, let these hollows sink in
You need an army to test them, the fuck was you thinkin' ?
Wooh, I done seen it all done it all
Shop with every jeweler, sold a ton of raw
Had the Franck Müller with the bezel thawed
My double pump days had to saw the metal off
Yuugh, it's the life of crime
They say it in they raps but this life is mine
Push

[Pont 2]
Bouge pas, j'ai ta tête dans la lunette
Rare comme un diamant français qui vient pas du bled
Mes négros peuvent faire toute sorte de sale pour des euros
Mes négros peuvent faire toute sorte de sale pour des euros
Bâtard, j'charbonne pour ma black card
L'Etat français nous doit une black card
C'est l'argent le cercueil ou le placard
Mes Blancs, mes Noirs, mes Chinois veulent leur black card

[Joke - Couplet 3]
Le rap j'lui creuse sa tombe à mesure qu'j'creuse ma tête
Les anciens veulent renaître autant que j'veux t'la mettre
Pour copier faut un patron, renoi, c'est moi le patron
T'as pas besoin d'être Michel-Ange pour qu'ton cerveau repeigne le plafond
J'me suis levé hier tellement j'me suis levé très tôt
Et vu c'que j'vous prépare j'crois que j'vais devoir me coucher très tard
J'fais glisser ta paire de bas
J'donne la main ils prennent le bras
Donc j'les doigte... et tu connais la suite mon négro[Produced by Young Chop]

I got dollars on my blocka
Serve it to my flocka
Yeah, that's my flocka
To my flocka
Pray to Lord on my shotta
She be proper
Yeah, that's my flocka

[Verse 1]
All praise to the most high on both sides
I pray to God, I pray for hard, I won't lie
Multi cause I'm dope-tied, convo and a boat ride
Rent-a-cars for the whole month, drop Porsche money, no co-sign
Yuugh, my records ain't got to sell, nigga
Woo, go diamond off of my cell, nigga
Give a fuck what you sells, that chance come, I take mine
I ball hard, you bench ride, so fuck you and yo' baseline
No Soundscan for a bricklayer, square nigga, you a brick hater
We see a bitch, you fall in love, I fall back cause my bitch date her
Where I'm from, we go crazy with them choppas
Sellin' dope, goin' diamond on my blocka

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Welcome to my blocka, take a look at my world
Diamond on my blocka, all we got is white girl
All we got is choppas, all you hear is choppas
All we see is choppas, that spotlight on my blocka
Dopeboy to the rescue, bad bitches get the best view
Lotta money just floatin' round, all them hoes feelin' special
Woo, I know the rent due, fuck me right and it's sent through
Third time you done used the line, God damn, she a pimp, too
Teamwork make the dream work, all my niggas done seen work
All my niggas ain't make it through, so much death that my dreams hurt
Where I'm from, we go crazy with them choppas
Sellin' dope, goin' diamond on my blocka

[Hook]Malice found religion, Tony found prison
I’m just tryna find my way out this fucking kitchen
A birds eye view got me channelling my vision
Turn one to two now the kilo’s got a sibling
Father knows best, wash my hands all's forgiven
We kicking up dust like the colosseum floors
Walls full of safes like they mausoleum doors
Pussy getting wet as she walking through my morgue
Grants, Jacksons, no room for George
Yeh, the fear of God’s in you muthafuckas
This art imitate my life
Your World Star Hip Hop fame based off imitation white
Eliminate the fool's gold and imitation ice
My music for your soul, inspiration for your life
Every dime I made in this life wasn't disastrous
Help my young bitch see my way through the Bachelors
Sent my old bitch right back to get her Masters
Same graduation I was clapping in the rafters
The truth hurts everytime it’s revealed
What goes around comes around, this is life's ferris wheel
Grab hold and reverse the steering wheel
As I parrallel park, Kentucky Derby on the grill
The fact that I’m free lets me know God is great
Ten year marathon of me selling concentrate
These rappers talk crowns but I’d rather talk fear
Villain like Candyman, say my name and I’ll appear
No weapon formed against me shall prosper
Hakuna matata, feet up sipping java
Strolling up the totem poll, what’s my only problem?
Scrolling through my Rolodex, who shall bear my toddler
So many hands raised as the band plays
I’m here now, watch how many nigga's plans change
First class flights, Ciroc soaked nights
Waking up to models, what a motherfuckin life[Verse 1: Juicy J]
I got some killers so don't push me, Juicy J be on some mob shit
Waiting by your doorstep, hidin' in the bushes (mhmm)
If it comes down to it, ain’t no thang but to do it
Got a vest on, got a gun that can really do it
You niggas playin' with real niggas' money, get fronted
One day you is the plug, next day you’re in the dumpster
Couldn’t keep it one hundred, you’re thirty-two percent
The police got you on a leash, nigga you a bitch

[Hook: Juicy J]
Give yo' ass that body work nigga we spraying
Ridin' with three K's nigga I ain't talking bout the Klan
This ain’t no arcade, nigga so quit playing
It’s eating time, me and my niggas buffeting
Give yo' ass that body work, nigga we spraying
Ridin' with three K's nigga I ain't talking bout the Klan
This ain’t no arcade, nigga so quit playing!
It’s eating time, me and my niggas buffeting

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
You don’t know about this life, nigga
Earning all of these stripes, nigga
Kilograms, Peter Pans, pack holders on bikes, nigga
Throwin bitches on flights, nigga
They ain't know that they're dykes, nigga
'Til the money’s out and the bottle's pouring
They’re in the midst of they life, nigga
Rose gold on my wrist
This Rolex like Devil's piss
This Daytona illuminate
Y'all think I'm talking that devil shit
This's fifty racks, no bezel shit
Like blood diamonds, it’s rebel shit
This's more guns, this's more bodies
We call shots, they nobodies
They fuck niggas, they owe prolly
Who's fuckin with me? Nobody
When the guns drawn, they’re so sorry
Spraying niggas now the Lord got 'em
Bullets out the barrel make your body jerk
Fuck with my money and I’ll hit you that body work

[Hook: Juicy J]

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Bad bitches on deck, nigga
Money, power, respect, nigga
Cop, cook, collect, nigga

These goons with me don't spit no verse
Just limo service, they stretch niggas
Black 'maro 2 S nigga
Couple birds on my neck, nigga
Everytime them hoes see me
They like, "Meek Milly you a mess, nigga"
2 gats, no vest, nigga
Strapped up like i’m a cowboy
Stand tall like that Yao boy
Got a bad bitch, she 5"4
This gold roley thats on my wrist
Leprechaun prolly die for
Young boys that's on my strip
They'll kill anything I say ride on
Tell them niggas call us if they're out of work
Cause we lifting weights but we don't do no body work

[Hook: Juicy J]

[Verse 4: French Montana]
Shout my lawyer all the crazy shit I ever did
Know we love that KK sound
You know we not backing down
100 drum like, "Hold that doe"
Diamonds flash like Kodak, though
Straight cash, nigga fuck that loan
Seven digits on that phone
Money so long, smoke a whole zone
Getting blood money, tryna put my cuz on
Bitch I’m on fire, got my jaw wired
Sex, money, murder - Peter Rollack (Soundview, whaddup)
Body work, chopper work like a techno song
Twenty thou' a show, I just hope my nigga Max come home (wavey)
Money fast, diamonds flash like high beams
Make it rain in this bitch - Hurricane Irene

[Hook: Juicy J][Hook: Red Cafe]
Boss bitches and fast cars

Got the drinks on ice and the watch on ice
Now the hoes feeling nice

[Verse 1: Red Cafe]
I only give a fuck bout my team
Now all the bad bitches fuck my team
Look i measure stacks with a ruler
Im getting googled by the youngins and the cougars
Got a team of dimes working at hooters
These niggas wearing fake Gold trying to fool us
My female friends they all boogie
Off that molly courtsey of yours truly
Yeah every hood red good!
Baby girl life easy, if you head good
I feel like i got wings on
Chain so heavy them slim bitches can swing on...

[Hook: Red Cafe]

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Look! I ain´t got to tell a story..(Facts!)

I turn my J´s to a black and yellow forie
Now thats a street nigga cinderella story..(Word!)
Time is money in the sky i dwell at 40
So in the City i be Car-Melo scorin
Wack bitch I´m not the fella for you
I cut a dame off... Roc a fella shorty...(shortyyy)
My bitch look way outta your budget
The hoes they talkin about she make´em change the subject
Thats how we give it up over here Boy
Got shots, got strong...Team Steroids!

[Hook: Red Cafe:]

[Verse 3 - Pusha T]
Red, you know we shared us like a couple
Them VA Girls used to ride them Lex Bubbles
Fab, you know we shared us like a couple
In B.K. they like they bad boys with a duffle
I´m looking for trouble, a pair made of double
We all knew the play I ain't have to call the huddle
The perk´s when you ballin like the Heat do
South Beach the whole condo is see through
Atlantic Ocean backdrop has us see blue
We was sea sick fuckin with them Sea-Doo´s
Talk Money and them nights to remember
Get your feelins crushed like the ice in a blender
(Gone!)

[Hook: Red Cafe][Intro: Pusha T]
It's the lifestyle (x4)

Million dollar dreamers
That comes with being genius
All that comes between us
Is that I'm all she Venus
I be with them dealers, that's twisting up they fingers
Selling all that white girl, and buyin' bitches Bimmers
Cocaine white arenas
Tip the scale like Libras
Balmain on my denim

My ninas (raah!), my ninas
Shout out to my hittas
Surround myself with killas

[Hook]

I came, I saw, I conquered, I balled
I came, I saw, I conquered, I balled
I came, I saw, I conquered, I balled
I came, I saw, I conquered, I balled

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Hold up, this the game, it chose us
Pioneer, started on my corner like the cold crush
Had smokers linin' up the block like a gold rush
The sayin' "life fast and die young" is what they told us
The way that they mold us, perfect way that showed us
How to get money, fuck bitches off this nose dust
Showed me how to burn the block down before it slows up
Before the window of opportunity close up

[Hook x2: Pusha T & Ayak]
I came, I saw, I conquered, I balled
I came, I saw, I conquered, I balled
Yogi said get em so I got 'em all (Yuugh!)
And turned this bitch into a burial

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Lookin' from the top floor, what would I stop for?
Still hear the crowd cheers, while I'm thinkin' encore
Flyin' on a Concorde, listening to Tom Ford
Frames match the song title, flyer than a Condor
Little niggas rhyme poor, poverty flows in ya
Part of beatin' hoes in, I am who you're tryin' for?
I think not - Pusha, stay hot
The coupe's got no roofs, forever they stay drop nigga

[Hook x4][Produced by Bangladesh]

[Hook]
And I move it and keep you straight
If it wasn't sellin' weight, I break that whole bitch down an eighth
If it's really that imported shit, you purchase up the state
If I drop it, it don't take that bitch the next time we gon'

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
2 Chainz, I tell 'em hurry up and buy
Nigga try to rob me, he gon' hurry up and die
I buy a chopper every year, like it's a summer line
I spend a quarter on my dime
When we leave the mall the car turn to Optimus Prime
And I'm buying irons for her little dog
But she hop on the dick like a bullfrog
And I move this shit like a U-Haul
Got a room full of hard, no RuPaul

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Fast Life]
007 missions, I'm a street marine
My chopper from the navy, all my drugs be ocean clean
I call the molly salt, bath salt machine
I drove up in from Colorado with that powder spring
Orange County, flip pounds from Spartanburg
And we from country nigga, we move slow from sippin syrup
First I sip and surf, then I sip and swerve
Take a nigga face off if he interrupt my pitching curve
All I think is money, I spend more cash than your family earn
My money make money so beef is what my shooters earn

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
One brick, two brick, three bricks, four
80k to play every time I go to score
He gotta charge me extra if he bring it to my door
I'm in my house slippers, here take that 40 more
I recompress it, powder stretches
Double Jeopardy, Alex Trebek it
Turn one to two, from two to coups
Spend a day in Dior to fuck a Betty Boop
Razors at my fingertips, on my Freddie Krueg'
Ain't no safeties on the choppas we gon' let 'em loose

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Tom Foolery]
I don't sell dope, but I move keys
And you can get the whole piano for 300 Gs
Straight drop, you know I'm talkin' 808
Whip it in a pyrex jar, move production out of state
The federalis lookin' cause the whip cost me a half a mil'
And they pussy, I'mma send that ass a massive yield
The roof butterfly, I push the button it Caterpillar
I say I worked with Eminem, they think I'm passin' pills
Look, a hundred geeks, keep the dope on the hard drive
Cut the cheque, split up the money like apartheid[Intro]
Coming live in direct from Abu Dhabi
Recorded in Emirate's palace
I bring to you the Fear of God, life of Don
Noah on the boards, Steven Victor on the camera, Virgil what up

[Verse]
They say this took confidence, I just call it patience
Cause I had too much pride to take this motherfucking cadence
Knowing the Feds watch me, private paparazzi
Still chasing me for war crimes like a Nazi
Against all odds, see the judge tryna' Pac me
Lucky dice roll got my lawyers screaming, Yahtzee
Who the fuck can stop me run away freight train
Mike Vick's redemption, big doggin like a great dane
12 cylinders 50 grams of willing ya
These rappers get away with pushing these child Illingers
Now it's hard feelings, I just put my ceiling up
Planetarium Push, the I-Max experience
They say I talk coke for 9 years long
That means my rap sheet is more than 9 years strong
You niggas would have thought that I was 9 years gone
But I am still in the mix like 9 ounces and a straw
Nigga get your bag on, bitch get your bag on
Balenciaga Hobo so heavy that you drag home
Yeah, see my verses let you tag along
Swim in the oasis of this drug dealers Babylon
Three bitches, three different flights
Glad it was four sides at that Paul Williams fight
The Wynn, the Bellagio, the Palms three nights
As long as they are separated they are my three blind mice
You can't just rap this, the same mindset
That had me hide it in the mattress, now got me round the atlas
Wish every doughboy could get a fair crack at this
They say when one ends, that begins a new chapter

[Outro]
Can I live
You tell me, can I live
