[Hook : Cee-Lo]
Nigga, you need to git up, git out and git something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't spend all your time trying to get high
You need git up, git out and git something
How will you make it if you never even try
You need to git up, git out and git something
Cause you and I got to do for you and I

[Verse 1: Cee-Lo]
I don't recall, ever graduating at all
Sometimes I feel I'm just a disappointment to y'all
Every day, I just lay around then I can't be found
Always asking "gimme some", living life like a bum
Times is rough, my auntie got enough problems of her own
Nigga, you supposed to be grown
I agree, I try to be the man I'm 'posed to be
But negativity is all you seem to ever see
I admit, I've done some dumb shit, and I'm probably gon do some mo'
You shouldn't hold that against me though (Why not?)
Why not? My music's all that I got
But some time must be invested for this to be manifested
I know you know but I'm gon' say this to you I...
Get high but I don't get too high
So what's the limit 'posed to be?
That must be why you can't get your ass up out the bed before three
You need to git up, git out, cut that bullshit out
Ain't you sick and tired of having to do without
Damn, what up with all these questions?
You act as though you know something I don't
Do you have any suggestions?
Cause every job I get is cruel and demeaning
Sick of taking trash out and toilet bowl cleaning
But I'm also sick and tired of struggling
I never ever thought I'd to have resort to drug smuggling
Naw, that ain't what I'm about
Cee-Lo will just continue traveling his route without any doubt
Or fear, I know the Lord ain't brought me this far so he could drop me off here
Did I make myself clear?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Well, uh, get up, stand up, so what's said, you dickhead
See when I was a youngster, used to wear them fucking Pro Keds
My mama made me do it, but the devil, he made me smart
Told me to jack them weak ass niggas for they fucking Starters
In the middle school, I was a bigger fool
I wore with tank tops to show off my tattoo, thought I was cool
I used to hang out with my daddy's brothers, I call them my uncles
They taught me how to smoke herb, I followed them when they ran numbers
So in a sense I was Rosemary's baby
And then, I learned the difference between a bitch and a lady
Hell, I treat 'em all like hoes, see I pimped 'em
Bitch never had my money, so I never whipped 'em
See all the playas came and all the playas went
A playa ain't a gangsta but a playa can handle his shit bitch
You need to git up, git out, git something
Smoke out, cause it's all about money, money, money
Yeah I said it, a nigga sporting plaits and a Braves hat
I hang with Rico Wade cause the Dungeon is where the funk's at, boy
I'm true to Organized, cause they raised me
I'm also down with LaFace cause L.A. Reid, yeah, he pays me
And it's cool
Yeah, it's real cool, getting paid fat pockets
And all that other fat shit like that, ha-ha

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Gipp]
A lot of people in my past tried to do me, screw me
Throw me over in the fire, let me get chunky and charred
Like a piece of wood and them spirits got the mutant's mind
I'm getting paranoid and steady looking for the time
It's eight in the morning and ain't nobody up yet
I got my long johns, get my coat and throw on my ball cap
I'm headed out the door, to get off in my ride
I'm digging through the ash tray, hoping to have a good day
I had Jamaica's best and when I light it up, I hear a voice in my head
(You got to git up, git out and git something)
Now I know it's on, my day is finally started
Back up in my crib, eat my shit, break out quick, in my slick
'84 Se-dan DeVille, steady bouncing
Out the Point to Campbellton Road
The valley of the Southside flow
Everybody know about that killa that we call blow, so
Keep your eyes peeled for the COBRA unit
Cause they known for jumping out of black Chevy trucks and through the fog
Here come the Red Dogs, I'm busting out around the corner in my hog
Dipping from the area, I'm scared
So one of these bitches might wind up dead
Cause I have no time for jail; fuck Clampett cops; fuck Eldrin Bell
And crooked ass Jackson, got the whole country
Thinking that my city is the big lick for '96
'94, Big Gipp, Goodie Mo, OutKast, a vision from the past
Hootie Hoo, my White Owls are burning kind of slow

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Andre 3000]
Y'all telling me that I need to get out and vote, huh. Why?
Ain't nobody black running but crack-kers, so, why I got to register?
I thinking of better shit to do with my time
Never smelled aroma of diploma, but I write the deep ass rhymes
So let me take ya way, back to when a nigga stayed in Southwest Atlanta, ay
Y'all could not tell me nothing, thought I hit that bottom rock
At age 13, start working at the loading dock
They laying my mama off of work, General Motors tripping
But I come home banked like Hank, from licking and dipping
Doing dumb shit, not knowing what a nigga know now
Yeah, that petty shit will have you cased up and locked down
I dips, over to East Point, still actin a fool
Wasting my time in the school, I'd rather be shooting pool
Cool is how I played the tenth grade
I thought it was all about macking hoes and wearing pimp fade
Instead of being in class, I'd rather be up in some ass
Not, thinking about them six courses that I need to pass
Graduation rolled around like rolly-pollies
Damn, that's fucked up. I should've listened when my mama told me
That, if you play now, you gonna suffer later
Figured she was talking yang yang, so I payed her no attention
And kept missing the point she tried to poke me with
The doper that I get, the more I'm feeling broke and shit
Huh, but that don't matter though, I am an O-UT-KAST
So get up off your ass

[Hook][Hook: Big Boi]
From the weave to the fake eyes
To the fake nails, down to the toes
Ha ha ha ha! We luv deez hoez
Ha ha ha ha! We luv deez hoez

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Don't lie you love them, if you don't you like them hoez a whole lot
Just like your mama Sunday cookin' turkey necks in the pot
You ready to drop your load like prop planes be droppin' that cocaine
You ready to turn your fro, from natural straight to a cold wave
Dat ho name Betty Big Shoez, she wore them Herman Munster heels
Popped a pill, now she's in your Coupe De Ville, passenger seat
I made her eat my meat while I was rubbin' her coochie
Injection in her top and bottom lip straight from her booty
So Do Re, blow me, Fa So La Ti Da Ha I'm tellin' the truth
You suckin' your tooth you treatin' her like a star boy
From a Figueroa to a herringbone
From droppin' her off to takin' her home
She tried to pull my rubber off with her pussy muscles that was wrong
The bitch is no good like lesbians with no tongues
You fucked around and knocked her up and now you say she the one
Nigga you dumb, you should have pulled it out and squirted on her eyelash
And let her face be holdin' the baby, now she after yo ass!
Yeah, I told y'all niggas
About god damn takin' them hoez to the Cheesecake Factory
Lettin' them hoez order strawberry lemonade and popcorn shrimps
They ain't goin' do nuthin'
But try to take all your motherfuckin' cheese! (Yeah!)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: BackBone]
Ay, ay, what's up lil' girl I see you workin' them Valente
She walk wit a fly Sashay
Look here say, I'm just a Fat Face I come through swervin' (ay, ay)
You love the way the leather grippin' your butt
Conversation kill 'em, drippin' em up
Relax Shawty, oh lordy, I quote the facts
Whippin' convertible with Daddy Fat Sax
I stay G sharp as a note of music
Call me fresh baked bread, make a broad lose it
I'm just sayin' they just can't stand to see me execute game plan
I slow it down, she like it - speed it up
She poked it out, I beat it up like that
Hit 'em from the back, had to increase that ho vocabulary

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Gipp]
Yeah, yeah, Gipp keep it double loco
Met up in Cafe Intermezzo for some late night pastry
Conversation hasty cause I was ready to dip
Sweatsuit velour so I ordered Kahlua
Fell in, hit her with the garden hose
Left her with the pokahose, got up and didn't say goodbye
Her face wrinkle up and froze
Why you leavin' so soon, supposed to
And ain't no question about that
They call me Big Gipp on the southside
Mr. Get Down in the veins so what's the word
Don't fall in love with good pussy off the top
Better leave for two months come back and pop, "study the shit"

[Hook][Verse 1: T-Mo]
Piece by piece, this puzzle comes together
Sever your ties with the bad guys, let the lies go
If you wanna be a ho, go 'head and don't be scared
Many a bitch, represents, and is led
Whichever way no I'm not gay
And really don't give a fuck bout what you doin
Long as I pave the way
For my SouthWest GA warriors
To come in packs, to feed, takin what we need
To succeed, you know what we gon' do, on this road
We gon' explode, now are you ready for this territory
Makin our life one big story to tell
Reality amongst the youth, long as, breath is in my body
I got proof, I'm not scared

If you scared, say you scared

[Verse 2: Gipp]
Who's scared?
In this world I'm Gipp, in second the mutant
The third the Geechee, how many ways can you reach me?
Now most be scully, went from clean to muddy
Polished to shine, the season to rhyme
Been down like brown, like dirt to the ground
Been lookin for love, now I bubble like suds
Others flew sky high, while others were duds
Live high up on the hills, to escape the floods
Situation they change, like faces and names
Went from cool to plain, from lame to flame
Man down or not, man plans or plots
Give a FUCK what you think, we ain't movin out this spot
And I'm out

If you scared, say you scared

[Verse 3: Andr√© 3000]
Yo, paragraph indent, I make intense sense
Niggas on that Gil Scott dope (hint hint)
At age fifteen they start smokin Billy Clint'
Now he's twenty-one and wants to know where the time went
Hey hey hey what's the haps? Well see your time elapsed
Have you ever thought of the meaning of the word trap?
Baboon on your back, but what's sad is that crack
Was introduced to Hispanic communities and blacks
But then it spread to white and got everyone's undivided attention
Cause your daughter is on it and you can't hide it
Maybe your son tried it, rehab too crowded
You scared, she scared, they scared, I said
They scared they scared to talk about it
Bout it bout it bout it bout it bout it

If you scared, say you scared

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
February 1st, 1975's my birthdate
The player the B-O-I, was brought onto this Earth on Thursday
I think see, my cap I twist it back from all the dank
But if you see me on the Ave, you betta believe I tote that shank
So what y'all though bruh?
I gotta protect my name and what we fought for
Southernplayalistic ATLiens in your sock drawer
No lockjaw, we got that raw shit and all the trimmings
Even though we got two albums, this one feel like the beginning
The intro, the Goodie we kinfolk, nigga it's fin to jump off
But now it's time I lay low
Cause I believe the track gon' cut off
Psych, the track is bumpin like pussies on some dykes
So if you scared say you scared cause everybody can die tonight
Cause my heart don't pump no Slushee
You touch my niggas you touch me
I blow up the microphone like Marilyn Manson, you can't hush me
Yeah

[Verse 5: Khujo]
Heat'll make anything move
Even Tyson, can get laid down, with this tool
Just cause the name say Goodie, you take us for fools
Out they rabbit ass mind, don't give me mine
I go off like mines, blowin suckers to smithereens
We was never folks if we fell out over this lil' cream
Or let some soft legs come in between our dreams
We live like Kings, and die like fuckin men
I don't care how rough you roll, we can't be shut down
Ain't no openin up shop, we already established
You lap doggin, we boss hoggin
Grown men, don't beg for attention
Keep wishin, high heels clickin
Paper champions, leavin with they feet behind
Zap em for the pumpkin, at twelve
On the bottom bunk, holla at me
Six to the left, last one, can't turn over with dirt on ya
Slain dead, devils, don't have enough to purchase my essence
In da head, missin ounces, zip code, eight miles
Suckas, think I got they package
But they still eatin moo-moo, oink-oink
And fowl-fowl-fowl-fowl.. *repeats*

The truth hurts, but you can't be scared of it
So remember that, OutKast, Goodie Mo-B
Still standin for somethin while y'all fallin for nothin
Stop dyin over this lil concrete and lil paper
We get this shit together our power's in numbers
You can deny the lie but you can't deny the truth
You scared, you scared, say you scared![Verse 1: Cool Breeze]
I call the crib they say "Breeze you ain't know?"
I say "What?" "Big Time got popped in his Benzo!"
I said "Damn man, I'm riding in his Lexus
I'm bout to dump this nigga's shit in New Dimensions
Get to the crib so I can call Big Slate up
And tell em the money man done slipped and got his throat cut
And everything that we took from the warehouse
I heard somebody talking 'bout it at the White House
Man I thought you said that this job was for me and you
I ain't know that Bill Clampett wanted some too
You tell his folks that I'm sorry bout that Lexus
I'm 'bout to dip and see my sister up in... naaah!
Can't even tell you where I put my extra playa card
Cause them Red Dog police know we homeboys
Just tell everybody who owe us a dime
It's the "great ho round up yo money" time
I got to have mine, then I'm outta here!
Take a loss, come back up just like Coco Grier
Ain't got to worry bout yo' partner getting caught like a lame
It won't be over til that big girl from Decatur sang"
(It won't be over till that big girl from Decatur sang!
East Point police don't know a damn thang...)

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Yeah, it won't be over, check this out
Can you see what I be hearing talking to spirits when I sleep
Peep this out real quick Slick, we gets on this beat and speak
About that pimp shit, that walk with dat limp shit, that hemp shit
Looking up in your face I see a coward and a dimwit
Looking to run up in my private home just like you was the folks
Serving a warrant to a baby daddy, who didn't come to court
On a Tuesday, April Fool's Day, don't get caught slipping
Leaving the keys off in the ignition, making me guilty by suspicion
Penny pinchers trying to stack for ninety-six
Buying another Fleetwood, Diamond took it, so know we's in the mix
I need to take my ass to the crib and drop the baby off
Cause them niggas at the corner sto' been looking at me for too long
Staring like accidents on highways, high days are better than sober ones
Don't be biased, but I know it has to come
So I put two in the sky to let them know I'm babysitting
Y'all don't know nothing bout Big Boi cause that nigga steady dipping
It ain't over (why that, why that) till the bitch open her mouth up
And sang...

[Verse 3: Big Gipp]
Took me a long time to get here
Long time man
I'm talking about, years, and years
Riding past funeral fields holding bodies of my peers
If you don't educate yourself
Now how the fuck you gonna understand how you supposed to get paid?
Niggas walk around get with shade tree ass ways
Fuck a fade, let my hair drag
Back and forth like a see-saw
Jumping Lily, to lilypad dag
Looking to get my Goodie feel
I'm broke in like some old men
Who'd stop dem or would stop
I'm dropping lines for the big plot
Sixteen is when I started this dream
It's ninety-six I'm in your face
Can you hear that bitch scream?

(It won't be over til that big girl from Decatur sang...)[Big Boi]
Yo
Just so you all know what time it is
It's your homeboy
Straight from the A-T
I ain't even goin say the motherfucking rest
But you know
It's Dungeon Family all day long baby
We finna break it off with some fresh new shit

[Verse 1--C-Bone]
This rap game lovely
Konkrete play a part cause the Feds want to bug me
Athletes want to be rappers, shawty, trust me
Bending corners in the Benz
Ridin like a bucket, nigga fuck it
I know some hoes slutty
I optioned a bitch off like a nigga playin rugby
I done seen a ghetto meal, little buddy, trust me
Jump European, came clean through customs, no questions
Perpetrators in the booth, rappin lame like they drug related
It made me sick to my stomach, lost a two and a baby
You don't grind, you be lying
Should be castrated, Lorena Bobitt maybe?

[Hook--Big Boi]
Tomb after tomb
Boom, boom after boom
Serving up emotion once you deep inside the tomb
From embryo to newborn, you can feel me in the womb
Cool, ooh, that's cool

[Verse 2--Lil' Brotha]
You see, I cock back Glocks, got more pull than slang shots
Hit G spots, I'm givin hoes back shots
I'm a young country boy, long socks with flip flops
But I pull up on your block in the 500 Benz drop
Konkrete, Aquemini, we takin this here to the top
Bust like balloons, who gives a damn if it goes pop
You say it's hot, well let me turn it up another notch
To my real niggas, won't you pump this out your Speakerboxxx
Fuck the cops, we makin noise and we won't stop
Bump, bump, there goes the boom and it's gon' drop
Old school, big shoes, nigga, no socks
We keep tools, see fools, bullets will flock

[Verse 3--Big Gipp]
They call me Mr. Ravioli, Mr. Scrotum, Mr. Poke Em with the Noodle
Mr. Cockerspaniel in your Poodle, after school tutor
Roto Rooter, addicted to follies
Like brown collies, stay soft fro crows
Swimming in the fallopian of an Ethiopian
Talking a different language, RBI fly wide
Talk to me now, 84 hard, 84 soft wit me now
Beautiful ladies, they want to walk wit me now, talk wit me now
Pussy pop for me now, sell cock for me now
Fight a bitch, hit her in the eye for me now
See you when I see you, now I'm out wit me now

[Hook]

[Verse 4--Supa Nate]
I will never fall off, I haul off heavy weight
Fuck wit me dog, I chop you up like Norman Bates
I'm true to this shit, I ain't new to this shit
Over a million sold on strictly weed, bricks
Flammable like gasoline when I'm lit up
I prefer my liquor dark and a mean white slut
It's over for you, cavern ass rapper, get out the game
You can fool the record labels but not the streets mayne
I just tell it how I see it nigga, facts is facts
The first verse I ever wrote, I got a Platinum plaque
I've been to hell and back so nigga give me my props
Konkrete, Big Boi, beatin through your Speakerboxxx

[Hook]

[Verse 5--Ludacris]
Ludacris, yeah I keep a Glock in case you like to leak a lot
Meanwhile, crankin' the volume knob up on my Speakerboxxx, so here he is!
Get the fuck on the ground
Is just a phrase you might hear strolling through the A-Town
They don't believe that we'll stab them in the abdomen
From College Park, Georgia to College Park, Maryland
So put your fist up boy, you wanna romp
You can Bankhead Bounce or get Eastside Stomped
Thinking way back before I got mine
Putting bullet holes through the neighborhood stop signs
Still wild is my adrenaline, yes, ladies and gentleman
Denenen, A hundred thou, bitch! Diamonds shimmerin
Catch me with a sack of dro, reaching for The Strap Below
I'm with some nasty hoes, eating pistachios
Y'all driving Subarus, stuck in your cubicles
I'm stuck in the air with weed crumbs under my cuticles

[Hook]

[Verse 6--Big Boi]
Fourth and goal
Should I take the three point field goal for the score or should I roll
Around and take the ball up the middle,the gut, the what, the hole
Cranium overload, overthrowed
Now we got seven more points on the board, fa sho
B-I-G B-O-I, me oh my, I think He's blessing me
Excelling in harmonious melody, boy we got the recipe
Like Ragu, it's in there, giving you some of the best of me
Player, pimp, gangster, poet
We gon' spit it, we gon' show it to your ass
"You're a champion" were my dad's last words before he passed
But I know one day we will once more cross paths
They say "Big Boi, can you pull it off without your nigga Dre"
I say "people, stop the madness cause me and Dre be okay"
OutKast, Cell Therapy to cell division
We done split it down the middle so you can see both the visions
Been spittin it damn near ten years, why the fuck would be be quittin?
Fuck, nigga[Hook] 2x
Never let the money and these broads break us
We right here 'til the Lord take us
We act a fool cuz the laws make us
"Baby.. You can't stop the hustle"

[Backbone]
You walk your ass 'cross my yard - get off my grass
You wanna get to that money - get off yo' ass
You wantsta know my name - you awsta ask
If you wanna see me for somethin - it's gon' cost ya cash
I see ya pokin outcha jeans girl you actin bad
Oooh, do that again wit'cha nasty ass
I caught her comin out the mall, with 2 or 3 bags
Now shawty got her at the wood shack, throwin her back
Champagne, chicken wings, and bubblebath
Catch me somewhere outta town signin autographs
Still workin street corners, straight servin them blacks
Them thirty-two fifth it for four and a half
I prefer a Cheverolet, when it's time to mash
And I smoke the 'dro weed, a hundred dollars a sack
I put up the big numbers nigga, check the stats
And I'm on the microphone with Gipp, Slimm, and Cass

[Hook] 2x

[Big Gipp]
Since the trashman only run once a week
If I miss it, I'm wait 'til night and dump it up the street
Behind the Winn-Dixie
Quiver, never step or kept up his penny drawers
To get an applause, appeared to have no flaws
In the situation, no dentation, smellin good
But I ain't gonna feel her, touchin up would be too easy
Sleazy, measly, lookin ugly like a person tryna sell me a dub
Fool A, C, D, and me
Trees ain't my reason for sendin your ass to grave and
Watch you say the grade is..
Burn like acid reflux, somebone'll order up the Pheffer chickens
While I order up a smoked duck (Thank You)
Get the gas to go, at the corner sto'
Keep my hand on the nine piece
In case somebody wanna disturb the peace (Always keepin my eyes open)
Uhh, cuz you, can't, stop the hustle

[Hook] 2x

[Slimm Calhoun]
Well I'm known for my shine, Southside
Eyes on the prize, it's Mr. Fly Guy
Mobbin, '68 Chevy, door vault ties
Jumped out muggin like I'm holdin twenty pies
Rocked up, work on the block
We keep it, chopped up in the spot, in the pot
Where we keep it, stocked up from the Frosty Flakes
To the chickens in the cake
If I drop it on the tool, it must be weight
Went with two and a quarter, came back with eight
Let Juke lick the plate, I re-rock the shape
Like it hot in the kitchen nigga, oven on bake
Got gorillas with banana clips, who love to go apes
Southpaw, side-strapped, known to leave yellow tape
Try and stop the hustle and crushed like grapes
Just for the taste... Just for the taste..

[Hook] 4x

Uh-uh (Uh-huh)
"Baby, you can't stop the hustle"
[Repeat until fade][Hook]
There‚Äôs no light in this room
It‚Äôs alright we got you
You shine like GOOOLLLDDD
Your walk by
Cause a scene
All the guys they agree
You shine like GOOOLLLDDD
Like GOOOLLLDDD

[Verse 1]
Everybody got a favorite girl
Beautifullest thing in this world
And I want to get in ya
And I want to get in ya
Your goals your dreams
Your life your interests
You shine like gold to me
Love take a hold of me

[Pre-Hook]
You are everything I ever wanted be my lady
So I had to take this opportunity to say

[Hook 2]
Just like my favorite song
Every time you play I sing along
Baby my number one girl is you

[Hook]

Fantasies of a mountain trail
I‚Äôm a knight, you‚Äôre a nightingale
Can‚Äôt you tell
By the way that I talk to you
By the way that I look at you
We a merry-go-round, our love go round and round
She‚Äôs my scream machine, our love go up and down

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook 2][Andre: intro (Hook)]

[Big Gipp]
I'm Mr. Boogie Boogie from the goodie goodie Gipp
Put my oogie oogie between your camel foot, so stay put

Knee cut, rack, toes showing, Po'
Holdin my eyes swollen
Cause I stare so hard, with no regard
Girl make that change, Shake that thang mama!

[Andre 3000: Hook]

[Big Gipp]
Touched what I never touched before
Seen what I never seen before
Woke up and seen the sun Sky high, sky high
Baby girl didn't even tell me bye-bye
She was gone without dropping the digits
She was gone without using my kitchen
She left without kissing my lips
One more time I wanna hold them hips
I hope we meet up again on a lunar eclipse

[Andre 3000: Hook][Hook]

Sshhh.... cuz I'll have Al Capone at your house boy
Pull up in my drop top, you like boy
To you it's a Bentley, to me it's a toy
I'm like a pimp boy
I ride spinners boy
I'm hopping out with 3000 dollar tennis boy
Come take a look at me
I'm off the chain boy
The gameover, bitch, you know my name boy
I'm Lil Flip boy
A Clover G boy
You better free Will Lean and Pimp C boy

[Hook]
- fade out[Verse 1: Cool Breeze]
I call the crib they say "Breeze you ain't know?"
I say "What?" "Big Time got popped in his Benzo!"
I said "Damn man, I'm riding in his Lexus
I'm bout to dump this nigga's shit in New Dimensions
Get to the crib so I can call Big Slate up
And tell em the money man done slipped and got his throat cut
And everything that we took from the warehouse
I heard somebody talking 'bout it at the White House
Man I thought you said that this job was for me and you
I ain't know that Bill Clampett wanted some too
You tell his folks that I'm sorry bout that Lexus
I'm 'bout to dip and see my sister up in... naaah!
Can't even tell you where I put my extra playa card
Cause them Red Dog police know we homeboys
Just tell everybody who owe us a dime
It's the "great ho round up yo money" time
I got to have mine, then I'm outta here!
Take a loss, come back up just like Coco Grier
Ain't got to worry bout yo' partner getting caught like a lame
It won't be over til that big girl from Decatur sang"
(It won't be over till that big girl from Decatur sang!
East Point police don't know a damn thang...)

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Yeah, it won't be over, check this out
Can you see what I be hearing talking to spirits when I sleep
Peep this out real quick Slick, we gets on this beat and speak
About that pimp shit, that walk with dat limp shit, that hemp shit
Looking up in your face I see a coward and a dimwit
Looking to run up in my private home just like you was the folks
Serving a warrant to a baby daddy, who didn't come to court
On a Tuesday, April Fool's Day, don't get caught slipping
Leaving the keys off in the ignition, making me guilty by suspicion
Penny pinchers trying to stack for ninety-six
Buying another Fleetwood, Diamond took it, so know we's in the mix
I need to take my ass to the crib and drop the baby off
Cause them niggas at the corner sto' been looking at me for too long
Staring like accidents on highways, high days are better than sober ones
Don't be biased, but I know it has to come
So I put two in the sky to let them know I'm babysitting
Y'all don't know nothing bout Big Boi cause that nigga steady dipping
It ain't over (why that, why that) till the bitch open her mouth up
And sang...

[Verse 3: Big Gipp]
Took me a long time to get here
Long time man
I'm talking about, years, and years
Riding past funeral fields holding bodies of my peers
If you don't educate yourself
Now how the fuck you gonna understand how you supposed to get paid?
Niggas walk around get with shade tree ass ways
Fuck a fade, let my hair drag
Back and forth like a see-saw
Jumping Lily, to lilypad dag
Looking to get my Goodie feel
I'm broke in like some old men
Who'd stop dem or would stop
I'm dropping lines for the big plot
Sixteen is when I started this dream
It's ninety-six I'm in your face
Can you hear that bitch scream?

(It won't be over til that big girl from Decatur sang...)[RZA]
You ain't shhh
Ya momma ain't shhh
Your daddy ain't shit
Your pussy ain't shhh
Bitch, you ain't shhh

But girl you ain't shhh
Your momma ain't shhh, your daddy ain't shhh
You talkin' shit girl, your pussy ain't shit
Your friends ain't shit, you whip ain't shhh

You see these wizards out here, trynna floss like
I wear the pants dada, I'm the boss papa
I'm a Survivor! I play the course dada
They got the little toy vibrators on there speed, chacha
See I don't need a man, don't need to see a man
But it seems to me ho, you wanna be a man
You Tinkerbell and your girlfriend is Peter Pan
Strap on the KY Jelly, you wanna eat ya friend

[Big Gipp]
I know the type, come down and take a little pipe
Then run up and call me cupcakes, say "I didn't fuck you right"
Shit, call me now, like that bitch on the tube with the tarot cards
Cuz, mushy gushy still goin for sale on the Boulevard
Now I didn't I see, didn't I see you walk on the porno flicks
Givin' brain at the same, give no bumper hit
Get them bent accross seas, damn near done rapped the world
And you qualify, my book here's a nasty girl

[Hook: Big Gipp]
You ain't shit, yo mama ain't shit
Yo daddy ain't shit, yo pussy ain't shit, bitch
You ain't shit, your friends ain't shit
Your whip ain't shit, pocketbook ain't shit

[Hook: RZA]
You ain't shit, yo daddy ain't shit
Yo mama ain't shit, and yo pussy ain't shit, bitch
You ain't shit, your friends ain't shit
Your whip ain't shit, pocketbook ain't shit, bitch

[Big Gipp]
Hey Bobby, I know this loot gobbler, hard knobber
More peaches than cobbler, corner store soliciter
Drawers up her ass wipe, what you want
And what you need, and what you get is two different things
Pulled over, Pea Street, and put the bitch out in the rain
Lost your mind, ya 409, riding the short yellow bus
Gipp ain't never been touched, left insane, drunk off of (?) lush
Hush, shit-kicker licker, stronger than Wild Turkey liquor
Tryin to entice her, movin to hit her, but I'd rather forget her nigga

[RZA]
Bodododo, plus her knees be purple, Gipp, she like to gurgle gurgle
And goggle, goggle, slurpy slurp and she swallow swallow
I met this Caramel Sundae, her name was Betty Boo
She put her period blood in her spaghetti stew (fuck no! fuck no!)
I knew her mama, her papa, plus her naughty daughter
She filled her baby's ba-ba up with toilet water
And Sun Dew, the whole Clan used to run threw
Her Power U, then just bless her wit the hair doo
Bitch, I pack a horse dick, plus you know my chain is frosted
One fuck from the apple head and shorty lost it

[Hook: RZA]
Cuz you ain't shit, yo mama ain't shit
Yo daddy ain't shit, yo cousins ain't shit, bitch
You ain't shit, yo whip ain't shit
Pocketbook ain't shit and yo friends ain't shit, bitch

[Hook: Big Gipp]
You ain't shit, yo folks ain't shit
Yo lawyer ain't shit, yo bumper car ain't shit, bitch
You ain't shit, yo boyfriend ain't shit
Your last name ain't shit, your whole family ain't shit, bitch

[Outro: RZA]
Fuckin' around, nigga from Israel
Bobby Digital, Big Gipp a/k/a Mute
Straight from the underground, we gone[Hook : Cee-Lo]
Nigga, you need to git up, git out and git something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't spend all your time trying to get high
You need git up, git out and git something
How will you make it if you never even try
You need to git up, git out and git something
Cause you and I got to do for you and I

[Verse 1: Cee-Lo]
I don't recall, ever graduating at all
Sometimes I feel I'm just a disappointment to y'all
Every day, I just lay around then I can't be found
Always asking "gimme some", living life like a bum
Times is rough, my auntie got enough problems of her own
Nigga, you supposed to be grown
I agree, I try to be the man I'm 'posed to be
But negativity is all you seem to ever see
I admit, I've done some dumb shit, and I'm probably gon do some mo'
You shouldn't hold that against me though (Why not?)
Why not? My music's all that I got
But some time must be invested for this to be manifested
I know you know but I'm gon' say this to you I...
Get high but I don't get too high
So what's the limit 'posed to be?
That must be why you can't get your ass up out the bed before three
You need to git up, git out, cut that bullshit out
Ain't you sick and tired of having to do without
Damn, what up with all these questions?
You act as though you know something I don't
Do you have any suggestions?
Cause every job I get is cruel and demeaning
Sick of taking trash out and toilet bowl cleaning
But I'm also sick and tired of struggling
I never ever thought I'd to have resort to drug smuggling
Naw, that ain't what I'm about
Cee-Lo will just continue traveling his route without any doubt
Or fear, I know the Lord ain't brought me this far so he could drop me off here
Did I make myself clear?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Well, uh, get up, stand up, so what's said, you dickhead
See when I was a youngster, used to wear them fucking Pro Keds
My mama made me do it, but the devil, he made me smart
Told me to jack them weak ass niggas for they fucking Starters
In the middle school, I was a bigger fool
I wore with tank tops to show off my tattoo, thought I was cool
I used to hang out with my daddy's brothers, I call them my uncles
They taught me how to smoke herb, I followed them when they ran numbers
So in a sense I was Rosemary's baby
And then, I learned the difference between a bitch and a lady
Hell, I treat 'em all like hoes, see I pimped 'em
Bitch never had my money, so I never whipped 'em
See all the playas came and all the playas went
A playa ain't a gangsta but a playa can handle his shit bitch
You need to git up, git out, git something
Smoke out, cause it's all about money, money, money
Yeah I said it, a nigga sporting plaits and a Braves hat
I hang with Rico Wade cause the Dungeon is where the funk's at, boy
I'm true to Organized, cause they raised me
I'm also down with LaFace cause L.A. Reid, yeah, he pays me
And it's cool
Yeah, it's real cool, getting paid fat pockets
And all that other fat shit like that, ha-ha

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Gipp]
A lot of people in my past tried to do me, screw me
Throw me over in the fire, let me get chunky and charred
Like a piece of wood and them spirits got the mutant's mind
I'm getting paranoid and steady looking for the time
It's eight in the morning and ain't nobody up yet
I got my long johns, get my coat and throw on my ball cap
I'm headed out the door, to get off in my ride
I'm digging through the ash tray, hoping to have a good day
I had Jamaica's best and when I light it up, I hear a voice in my head
(You got to git up, git out and git something)
Now I know it's on, my day is finally started
Back up in my crib, eat my shit, break out quick, in my slick
'84 Se-dan DeVille, steady bouncing
Out the Point to Campbellton Road
The valley of the Southside flow
Everybody know about that killa that we call blow, so
Keep your eyes peeled for the COBRA unit
Cause they known for jumping out of black Chevy trucks and through the fog
Here come the Red Dogs, I'm busting out around the corner in my hog
Dipping from the area, I'm scared
So one of these bitches might wind up dead
Cause I have no time for jail; fuck Clampett cops; fuck Eldrin Bell
And crooked ass Jackson, got the whole country
Thinking that my city is the big lick for '96
'94, Big Gipp, Goodie Mo, OutKast, a vision from the past
Hootie Hoo, my White Owls are burning kind of slow

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Andre 3000]
Y'all telling me that I need to get out and vote, huh. Why?
Ain't nobody black running but crack-kers, so, why I got to register?
I thinking of better shit to do with my time
Never smelled aroma of diploma, but I write the deep ass rhymes
So let me take ya way, back to when a nigga stayed in Southwest Atlanta, ay
Y'all could not tell me nothing, thought I hit that bottom rock
At age 13, start working at the loading dock
They laying my mama off of work, General Motors tripping
But I come home banked like Hank, from licking and dipping
Doing dumb shit, not knowing what a nigga know now
Yeah, that petty shit will have you cased up and locked down
I dips, over to East Point, still actin a fool
Wasting my time in the school, I'd rather be shooting pool
Cool is how I played the tenth grade
I thought it was all about macking hoes and wearing pimp fade
Instead of being in class, I'd rather be up in some ass
Not, thinking about them six courses that I need to pass
Graduation rolled around like rolly-pollies
Damn, that's fucked up. I should've listened when my mama told me
That, if you play now, you gonna suffer later
Figured she was talking yang yang, so I payed her no attention
And kept missing the point she tried to poke me with
The doper that I get, the more I'm feeling broke and shit
Huh, but that don't matter though, I am an O-UT-KAST
So get up off your ass

[Hook]Khujo
Gipp
T-Mo (Uh-huh)
Y'all know how we do it down here in this dirty, man
It's your boy Nitty, and you know what I do
We gone represent this thing right to the fullest (alright)
Southwest (what?), Dent (who?), East Point (what?), College Park, where y'all at?
All my niggas, you know what time it is
Y'all know how we get down
To the fullest
Alright
Let's do it

[Verse 1: Khujo]
K to the H to the U to the J to the O G double O D to the I to the E
One for the G MO to the B
Schooled by the B to the E to the S to the T
Hundred percenter, so winner
Suck up and see the venom like it ain't no thing
Then wash it down it with a glass of Tang
Bang cock suck them rappers mouthing off in a magazine
See the fire, feel the flame
Jacktime Atlanta mafia came
We don't care who you with
Screw your name
Snatch your chain
Street punks messing up the game
Once a lame, always a lame
Trick busters ain't who they claim
Come around here wiling out, you will get changed
It's business, never personal
Get it with a chain on your brain
Get it with a lick we, um, at a shooting range
You can holler God MC, but you gone die like a man
Blood is pain
I make it simple and plain
Blat point blank range
All these poppas leave the bathroom in his name
It's a crying shame
What a nigga do for the fame!

[Ad-libs]
This is what really goes down in the South
We gone get down shawty

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Drank smoke dro
Stack dough
Pimp hoes
Pockets on swole with a mouth full of gold
How we ride in the South
Playing house four doors
Drop the top when it's hot
Pump the heat when it's cold

[Verse 2: Big Gipp]
Remember me?
Big Gipp, AKA the Big Dipper
Moon pot flipper
If the flame fizzle
I'm a go to the block and set the niggas
Most improved hitter
In the pocket like a rocket is how I like it
I'm a cantaloupe spitter
Let the horn blow
Hoes too
Hold true and drive through
If I couldn't walk around I took the train or flew
Look what it come to
More hugs, more lies, more love, more flies
More ways of turning corners burning up my new rally tires
I keep it stinking like Doritoes
Never owned a pair of Speedos
Never slacking Cadillac jacking
Damn he just so sweet
Choking Killa B with no tint
Want the whole world to see
Thorugh the tree
Glass house, rag top, and pass out
Hit the stash house
Get what I need and then I mash out
Couple turkey legs
Throw a few golds up in my head
Comprehend what I said
This is truly how it be representing for East Point
When I'm standing in the field

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Murder]
You can find me
Somewhere in Decatur in a Chevy and I'm riding on dubs
Or you might see
Me coming through the streets with a freak in the late night clubs
Hustling for that cheese
Standing in the hood in the cut me and my dog on a shopping spree
From the west did a robbery and I saw my first call hit jazzy T
Then we hit Magic City and headed for the bounce
Blowing chronic leaves
Or should I say dro?
My click won't blow by the ounce
Lyrical arsonist
Living in the slums in Atlanta they got me for me murder
I run with the hardest clique
In the S.W.A.T.s to the deck I was a hard ass nigga
Better show you we off in a velvet room
Was fucking in a gentleman club
We in VIP
Sipping crystal
From the goose to the yack
We can see SOV, Goodie MO B my nigga Khujo
On a plate trying to get rich
The way that we spit be ridiculous
And we'll go head over any lyricist
From Gooben to Cambleton Road
Platinum making fee all the way to College Park
From Bankhead to Gabbey Road
My whole clique nothing in the city ever born so hard
So
This is for
The niggas with the dough and whips sitting on two threes
So all the real motherfuckers can forget about the ghetto with a real 'Lac
In the streets

[Hook]

[Verse 4: T-Mo]
It's the dirty dirty playa
Just hit thirty
Bullseye
Better not cry
Make birds fly
Off in the sky
Away so high
Everybody dies
Many try, miss
Get what you get boy
Talk that shit boy
Flip them bills
Crooks get killed
Nine millimill
Running them suckers up out the ville
Trill
Still, waters run deep
Off in the South
While they sleep
Off in the South
While they creep
Open up your mouth and sing!
Off in the South we
Built this bitch
Run this bitch
Hit that switch
Up and down
Flip that trick
Ride it 'round
Black white doors
Pound for pound one of the best to ever represent the mighty southwest
ATL to the fullest
ATL to the fullest!

[Ad-libs]
There you have it
I want to congratulate all the DJs
Who got a chance to play this record without the club getting tore up
From yours truly
Sincerely
Nitty[Big Boi]
Yo
Just so you all know what time it is
It's your homeboy
Straight from the A-T
I ain't even goin say the motherfucking rest
But you know
It's Dungeon Family all day long baby
We finna break it off with some fresh new shit

[Verse 1--C-Bone]
This rap game lovely
Konkrete play a part cause the Feds want to bug me
Athletes want to be rappers, shawty, trust me
Bending corners in the Benz
Ridin like a bucket, nigga fuck it
I know some hoes slutty
I optioned a bitch off like a nigga playin rugby
I done seen a ghetto meal, little buddy, trust me
Jump European, came clean through customs, no questions
Perpetrators in the booth, rappin lame like they drug related
It made me sick to my stomach, lost a two and a baby
You don't grind, you be lying
Should be castrated, Lorena Bobitt maybe?

[Hook--Big Boi]
Tomb after tomb
Boom, boom after boom
Serving up emotion once you deep inside the tomb
From embryo to newborn, you can feel me in the womb
Cool, ooh, that's cool

[Verse 2--Lil' Brotha]
You see, I cock back Glocks, got more pull than slang shots
Hit G spots, I'm givin hoes back shots
I'm a young country boy, long socks with flip flops
But I pull up on your block in the 500 Benz drop
Konkrete, Aquemini, we takin this here to the top
Bust like balloons, who gives a damn if it goes pop
You say it's hot, well let me turn it up another notch
To my real niggas, won't you pump this out your Speakerboxxx
Fuck the cops, we makin noise and we won't stop
Bump, bump, there goes the boom and it's gon' drop
Old school, big shoes, nigga, no socks
We keep tools, see fools, bullets will flock

[Verse 3--Big Gipp]
They call me Mr. Ravioli, Mr. Scrotum, Mr. Poke Em with the Noodle
Mr. Cockerspaniel in your Poodle, after school tutor
Roto Rooter, addicted to follies
Like brown collies, stay soft fro crows
Swimming in the fallopian of an Ethiopian
Talking a different language, RBI fly wide
Talk to me now, 84 hard, 84 soft wit me now
Beautiful ladies, they want to walk wit me now, talk wit me now
Pussy pop for me now, sell cock for me now
Fight a bitch, hit her in the eye for me now
See you when I see you, now I'm out wit me now

[Hook]

[Verse 4--Supa Nate]
I will never fall off, I haul off heavy weight
Fuck wit me dog, I chop you up like Norman Bates
I'm true to this shit, I ain't new to this shit
Over a million sold on strictly weed, bricks
Flammable like gasoline when I'm lit up
I prefer my liquor dark and a mean white slut
It's over for you, cavern ass rapper, get out the game
You can fool the record labels but not the streets mayne
I just tell it how I see it nigga, facts is facts
The first verse I ever wrote, I got a Platinum plaque
I've been to hell and back so nigga give me my props
Konkrete, Big Boi, beatin through your Speakerboxxx

[Hook]

[Verse 5--Ludacris]
Ludacris, yeah I keep a Glock in case you like to leak a lot
Meanwhile, crankin' the volume knob up on my Speakerboxxx, so here he is!
Get the fuck on the ground
Is just a phrase you might hear strolling through the A-Town
They don't believe that we'll stab them in the abdomen
From College Park, Georgia to College Park, Maryland
So put your fist up boy, you wanna romp
You can Bankhead Bounce or get Eastside Stomped
Thinking way back before I got mine
Putting bullet holes through the neighborhood stop signs
Still wild is my adrenaline, yes, ladies and gentleman
Denenen, A hundred thou, bitch! Diamonds shimmerin
Catch me with a sack of dro, reaching for The Strap Below
I'm with some nasty hoes, eating pistachios
Y'all driving Subarus, stuck in your cubicles
I'm stuck in the air with weed crumbs under my cuticles

[Hook]

[Verse 6--Big Boi]
Fourth and goal
Should I take the three point field goal for the score or should I roll
Around and take the ball up the middle,the gut, the what, the hole
Cranium overload, overthrowed
Now we got seven more points on the board, fa sho
B-I-G B-O-I, me oh my, I think He's blessing me
Excelling in harmonious melody, boy we got the recipe
Like Ragu, it's in there, giving you some of the best of me
Player, pimp, gangster, poet
We gon' spit it, we gon' show it to your ass
"You're a champion" were my dad's last words before he passed
But I know one day we will once more cross paths
They say "Big Boi, can you pull it off without your nigga Dre"
I say "people, stop the madness cause me and Dre be okay"
OutKast, Cell Therapy to cell division
We done split it down the middle so you can see both the visions
Been spittin it damn near ten years, why the fuck would be be quittin?
Fuck, nigga[Hook: Big Boi]
From the weave to the fake eyes
To the fake nails, down to the toes
Ha ha ha ha! We luv deez hoez
Ha ha ha ha! We luv deez hoez

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Don't lie you love them, if you don't you like them hoez a whole lot
Just like your mama Sunday cookin' turkey necks in the pot
You ready to drop your load like prop planes be droppin' that cocaine
You ready to turn your fro, from natural straight to a cold wave
Dat ho name Betty Big Shoez, she wore them Herman Munster heels
Popped a pill, now she's in your Coupe De Ville, passenger seat
I made her eat my meat while I was rubbin' her coochie
Injection in her top and bottom lip straight from her booty
So Do Re, blow me, Fa So La Ti Da Ha I'm tellin' the truth
You suckin' your tooth you treatin' her like a star boy
From a Figueroa to a herringbone
From droppin' her off to takin' her home
She tried to pull my rubber off with her pussy muscles that was wrong
The bitch is no good like lesbians with no tongues
You fucked around and knocked her up and now you say she the one
Nigga you dumb, you should have pulled it out and squirted on her eyelash
And let her face be holdin' the baby, now she after yo ass!
Yeah, I told y'all niggas
About god damn takin' them hoez to the Cheesecake Factory
Lettin' them hoez order strawberry lemonade and popcorn shrimps
They ain't goin' do nuthin'
But try to take all your motherfuckin' cheese! (Yeah!)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: BackBone]
Ay, ay, what's up lil' girl I see you workin' them Valente
She walk wit a fly Sashay
Look here say, I'm just a Fat Face I come through swervin' (ay, ay)
You love the way the leather grippin' your butt
Conversation kill 'em, drippin' em up
Relax Shawty, oh lordy, I quote the facts
Whippin' convertible with Daddy Fat Sax
I stay G sharp as a note of music
Call me fresh baked bread, make a broad lose it
I'm just sayin' they just can't stand to see me execute game plan
I slow it down, she like it - speed it up
She poked it out, I beat it up like that
Hit 'em from the back, had to increase that ho vocabulary

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Gipp]
Yeah, yeah, Gipp keep it double loco
Met up in Cafe Intermezzo for some late night pastry
Conversation hasty cause I was ready to dip
Sweatsuit velour so I ordered Kahlua
Fell in, hit her with the garden hose
Left her with the pokahose, got up and didn't say goodbye
Her face wrinkle up and froze
Why you leavin' so soon, supposed to
And ain't no question about that
They call me Big Gipp on the southside
Mr. Get Down in the veins so what's the word
Don't fall in love with good pussy off the top
Better leave for two months come back and pop, "study the shit"

[Hook][Juicy J] (Big Gipp)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Three 6 Mafia (Here it is)
Know what I'm sayin'
Goodie Mob (Triple Six Mafia)
ATL (Big Gipp)
M-town connection (Man)

What you know? What you know?

Chorus: DJ Paul & Big Gipp [together] (2x)
What you know? What you know?
'Bout the B's, bout that O
'Bout these streets, 'bout this 9
'Bout these niggas doin' time

Bout the kickin' in the do'
Layin' suckers on the flo'
Gettin' low down with the dope

[Lord Infamous]
In Memphis, I'm a felonist, don't fuck with ghetto presidents
Run up in your residence, gather all the evidence
Murder list is specialist, clickin' on this medicine
Unloadin' a Tec in this, hang you by your neck-a-lace
All in for the blessedness, Lord Infamous reck-a-less
Mobbin', I'm the messiest, best, there is no testin' this
Hellraiser, I'm hookin' 'em, four star chef, I'm cookin' 'em
Like that, now I'm bookin' 'em, slash they eyes out look at 'em

[Crunchy Black]
What you know about killaz, what you know about dealers
What you know about niggas that live fake, know I'm for real-a
What you know about bitches, what you know about clickin'
One in the chamber so nigga now you know I'm out to get ya
What you know about reobbin', what you know about mobbin'
Mobbin' all through the hood nigga doin' my job 'n
I ain't tryin' to be starvin', I'm just leg over barbin'
Poppin' shots at your head, nigga doin' my job 'n

Chorus: DJ Paul & Big Gipp [together] (2x)

[Juicy J]
Juciy always be gamin', keep that roast to the flame 'n
Slangin' dope in the Grove, all the way to Black Haven
Call your boy on the cell, if you want somethin', hail
We got prostitutes and whitey-white just tryin' to make mail
Have you been to the North, Memphis where I be stayin'
Where them golds, they be shinin', nothin' but smiles on they faces
Always stumblin', rumblin', keep the freaky hoes comin'
If they wanna suck the dick, we put that nut in they stomach

[DJ Paul]
Ain't no problem that's to big, nigga fucked up 'bout no task
Two of them coloreds with them masks, sawed-off pumps for mega-blast
Forty-thousand, one in the chamber, buck artila for gettin' his own man
Nigga I'm my own man, never catch me runnin' from no man
It's so strange, the look on you face that does not bring
Or brings it to doors lane, put blood on your close lane
Your eyes be like closin', hoes from head to toes 'n
Fuck 'round with the chosen, got you stiff like posin'

Chorus: DJ Paul & Big Gipp [together, Big Gipp sings] (2x)

[Big Gipp] (Juicy J)
Don't give a fuck, I'm stayin' slizzard
Tough like chicken gizzards, strickly 'Cardi, wizard
Pill popper, afro, straight blowed
Corner coves, what I'm talkin', what you know
'Bout that girl, 'bout that boy, keep that nose itchin'
Skin scrachin', junkies steady bitchin'
I can't feel it, nigga please, stop that actin', cough it up
4 for the 5, is what I'm sellin', sawed-off 12 'n started bailin'
Kickin' do's, snatchin' clothes, catchin' hoes, gettin' cases
Sittin' in the country thinkin' about my money on vacation
This for the ones that love the club pop, sip-sip
Gipp dip, In a ho, in the jail, rollin' crip
Keep it crackin', keep it throwed, who shot first, nobody knows
How it goes, what you know, 'bout these streets I'm down fo'
(ATL...)[Verse 1: T-Mo]
Piece by piece, this puzzle comes together
Sever your ties with the bad guys, let the lies go
If you wanna be a ho, go 'head and don't be scared
Many a bitch, represents, and is led
Whichever way no I'm not gay
And really don't give a fuck bout what you doin
Long as I pave the way
For my SouthWest GA warriors
To come in packs, to feed, takin what we need
To succeed, you know what we gon' do, on this road
We gon' explode, now are you ready for this territory
Makin our life one big story to tell
Reality amongst the youth, long as, breath is in my body
I got proof, I'm not scared

If you scared, say you scared

[Verse 2: Gipp]
Who's scared?
In this world I'm Gipp, in second the mutant
The third the Geechee, how many ways can you reach me?
Now most be scully, went from clean to muddy
Polished to shine, the season to rhyme
Been down like brown, like dirt to the ground
Been lookin for love, now I bubble like suds
Others flew sky high, while others were duds
Live high up on the hills, to escape the floods
Situation they change, like faces and names
Went from cool to plain, from lame to flame
Man down or not, man plans or plots
Give a FUCK what you think, we ain't movin out this spot
And I'm out

If you scared, say you scared

[Verse 3: Andr√© 3000]
Yo, paragraph indent, I make intense sense
Niggas on that Gil Scott dope (hint hint)
At age fifteen they start smokin Billy Clint'
Now he's twenty-one and wants to know where the time went
Hey hey hey what's the haps? Well see your time elapsed
Have you ever thought of the meaning of the word trap?
Baboon on your back, but what's sad is that crack
Was introduced to Hispanic communities and blacks
But then it spread to white and got everyone's undivided attention
Cause your daughter is on it and you can't hide it
Maybe your son tried it, rehab too crowded
You scared, she scared, they scared, I said
They scared they scared to talk about it
Bout it bout it bout it bout it bout it

If you scared, say you scared

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
February 1st, 1975's my birthdate
The player the B-O-I, was brought onto this Earth on Thursday
I think see, my cap I twist it back from all the dank
But if you see me on the Ave, you betta believe I tote that shank
So what y'all though bruh?
I gotta protect my name and what we fought for
Southernplayalistic ATLiens in your sock drawer
No lockjaw, we got that raw shit and all the trimmings
Even though we got two albums, this one feel like the beginning
The intro, the Goodie we kinfolk, nigga it's fin to jump off
But now it's time I lay low
Cause I believe the track gon' cut off
Psych, the track is bumpin like pussies on some dykes
So if you scared say you scared cause everybody can die tonight
Cause my heart don't pump no Slushee
You touch my niggas you touch me
I blow up the microphone like Marilyn Manson, you can't hush me
Yeah

[Verse 5: Khujo]
Heat'll make anything move
Even Tyson, can get laid down, with this tool
Just cause the name say Goodie, you take us for fools
Out they rabbit ass mind, don't give me mine
I go off like mines, blowin suckers to smithereens
We was never folks if we fell out over this lil' cream
Or let some soft legs come in between our dreams
We live like Kings, and die like fuckin men
I don't care how rough you roll, we can't be shut down
Ain't no openin up shop, we already established
You lap doggin, we boss hoggin
Grown men, don't beg for attention
Keep wishin, high heels clickin
Paper champions, leavin with they feet behind
Zap em for the pumpkin, at twelve
On the bottom bunk, holla at me
Six to the left, last one, can't turn over with dirt on ya
Slain dead, devils, don't have enough to purchase my essence
In da head, missin ounces, zip code, eight miles
Suckas, think I got they package
But they still eatin moo-moo, oink-oink
And fowl-fowl-fowl-fowl.. *repeats*

The truth hurts, but you can't be scared of it
So remember that, OutKast, Goodie Mo-B
Still standin for somethin while y'all fallin for nothin
Stop dyin over this lil concrete and lil paper
We get this shit together our power's in numbers
You can deny the lie but you can't deny the truth
You scared, you scared, say you scared!Gotta get on my job
Take it back to the warehouse
Plot back in

[Gipp]
A late night escape, hit me on the script
On the hip, gotta dip
Hollering, calling me out like a Girl Scout
Better go ahead and sell your cookies later
Fuck up out my face, rookie
Took me on a trip away
Chopping trees, eating grits with runny eggs
I'm always tripping on the beggars working the same corner
Trying to vamp me with the creases in your clothes
Sticking cuffs up in my face, don't act
Fumbling, pretty scared like tailbacks they flow
Knees and elbows got drug in the parking lot
So jellybeans (where ya at?) come clean
Come on in, sit down, relax and catch your wind
Some pretend but this man don't bend
Limping like Willy, turning bunks face down
On the military campground
And I'm out, nigga

[Phoenix]
Yeah, all this goddam grinding ain't shit
(ho hustling) Cause I ain't got nathan to show
Except small quantities of blow
And enough flow to keep my lil boy belly full
But when that little bit run out
Pray your card don't get pulled
Should my path ever be crossed
On my family-feeding missions
Missing persons lives lost, inside edition
Kissing ass on nine-to-fives ain't gon keep me alive
Had to do without a lot still I seem to survive
Tried that straight path with the bow lean
Better with this new world, fitting in
Like a buzzard in a bed of swirl
Pearl handle on this firearm
Partner stay calm, now pass me your bomb
I thought your moms
Had told you about them niggas in the slums
(East Point, smoke something)

[T-Mo]
I wish you were me and I was you
Maybe then you would see what I go through
Each and every day, making up thangs to say, to speak
Uplifting words from my soul to keep
And my niggas that fantasize how wide the ride get
The concert, never the need to rob or car jack
The fact is to keep a cool head and chill
And get your Bible, it says thou shalt not kill
We do it anyway, and focus on short-lived enjoyment
And blame it on the white folks cause they supporting it
360 degrees of emcees from the Tree
To from one fourth of the MoB (SWATs)

[Witchdoctor]
Yeah, smallest predator on the Georgia plains
I'm about to take your mind on a journey
Uh, seeker no sleeper
I walk the streets, God keep me safe
Evil's raped this planet, damn it
I can't stand it, come travel to South West Atlant-ic
With me, there will be no stops in the bluff
A motherfucker sniffs his snuff
Sometimes it's tough to cope
Came a long way, and with so far to cover
Let me drank with y'all Gs
Moether Nature's seeds keep your eyes open
The seven seas rumbling, bullets they coming
Uh, the devil's shot it, human beings robotic
I'm got my chrome, man
When niggas start disappearing about cloning
Sometimes I feel weak
Mentally I'm one of the firest niggas in the street
With this rap shit I paid my dues
I never thought that I was better than you
Uh, niggas wanna die you'll get your wish
Goodbye, you outta here, never coming back
Niggas dying with their straps, uh
I can't adapt, I want a free life
I'm in the dark throw me a light
Blaze 'em high, let's expand
Rule the land, invest with a vest
If you catch a slug to the chest
So much turmoil you put yourself in
So much sin each of us has slept in
Bout to inject this chord
You know something about this rap shit
But you ain't know nathan about the Lord
Outta hereHook

Yo if you wanna go to war, its alright
Well if you ain't hardcore, its alright
You wanna get it on nigga, its alright
Its alright (its alright), It's alright (its alright) (x2)

(JT Money)
I got a problem with fuck niggas
Always talkin' shit and try to duck niggas
Sucker niggas won't finish what they started
Be coppin' dueces cause them niggas soft-hearted
They straight bitches
Always puttin' on shows for these niggas and hoes
Be wantin' to run your mouth but won't throw no blows
Ain't got no scrap, better kill that rap
Think life is a game, until that ass get tapped
And when it do, what you do, you run like a bitch
Or do you straight turn state on a nigga and snitch
When you ain't got your boys, you ain't got no balls
And you ain't gangsta with all them 911 calls
Real niggas don't call police
Real niggas handle theirs when they got beef
Flawed niggas talk shit and know they can't back it
Know they ain't real but always trying to act it

Hook

I'm the original jacker, flawed boy attacker
Taking your life ain't nothing but a factor
Matter of fact, I'm a killer straight out the slums
No time to dump, I got these pumps for you chumps
And I ain't talking bout' the reeboks
Getting three Glocks and jumping out of treetops
Making suckers flee spots, and leave knots
Got guns, get funds, yeah I'm packing styles
Suckers acting foul, get smoked like Black and Milds
Nigga know a plan, laying down this thing
Beyond all that rap shit, I only spit game
You scared, say you scared, but just peep what I said
I'm so wicked off the head, probably shoot out of dread
Thats right, all you suckers better recognize
Before I start recognizing, ain't gonna have you niggas sweatin' mine
I'm in this thang for real, ain't nothing fake here
Putting down in the zone with my nigga Shakespeare

Hook

(Big Gipp)
I wear my hat low, when I walk through a circle of folks I don't know
It ain't to much chalk in these streets that can hold me back
I make stacks and stacks, for the weeks and weeks I got slapped
Freaks, I got the grill with the white gold
Keep a pistol in my hand with the tight hold
From the city where they drop blows
Known to pin-hold down off them figure fours
Shit shady, we all about to bust on sight, lighting up the night
Putting hoes off in 74's and watching em' all blow
It ain't shit funny, its the money man and Gipp
Holding sawed-off pumps in your face chump
Don't disrespect the city, streets, that I'm standing on
Niggas from Miami and Atlanta holdin' heat
It ain't nothing happy
You see, it ain't all about that rapping

Hook

(JT Money)
Straight up and down, I'm a let you fuck nigga know
You niggas don't want war, talking all that shit
Cause you apted up on that motherfucking tough guy juice
Get round' the motherfucking boys, listen to this goddamn rap music
And niggas think its a motherfucking game
Alright, play with it
Jt Money, Big Gipp, let you niggas know

Hook-Big Gipp
Now here's a little story that must be told
About a little white girl that was born to soul
She was the first of a kind I was scared to speak
She had long red hair perfume was sweet
It shouldn't be taboo but it is
Might not be your reality but it's his
Black, red, white, blue and all the blue above
Now tell me whats wrong with unconditional love?

-CeeLo
I remember like it was yesterday
When I went over her house to play
With Amy, Amy Amy Amy
She welcomed me to the neighborhood
She showed you that this neighbor good
Oh Amy, Amy, Amy, Amy

Growin' up with so much fun
Wish we could be forever young
Said watch the time go by
My..

[Hook:]
I finally found the right girl, right girl
Ooh, Golly gee she sure is fine
I finally found the right girl, right girl
Ohh, if you're sorry it woud blow your mind
Thanks for the memories
And i hope you remember me, oh Amy
Cause I'll always remember you

-V
Do you?
I'm a try me some new too
If It work out for you, who knew
The misunderstanding is mutual boo
A lot people feel like life ain't fair
Still believe there somebody for me out there
Ain't gotta be black, ain't gotta be yellow
Ain't gotta be white, just gotta be right

-CeeLo
I use to use the back sliding door
What we hiding for?
Amy Amy Amy Amy Amy
I want to make your father mad
If I wasn't the only brother you had
Ooh Amy, Amy, Amy Amy

What's wrong with me and you?
As long as our love is true?
I still wonder why
But you'll always be my

[Hook]

We really liked each other a lot
And all her friends were really hot
She was really a good dancer
Her mom and dad were actually cool
Spent the whole summer in the pool
Smoking fff with her brother Johnny

I say Amy
You are the one that made me believe in love
I see you shining from the far just the way you are
Amy, you're a superstar/

I finally found the right girl
I finally found the right girl

[Hook]
Another day, another dollar
When your back against the wall and you‚Äôre tryna do right
With the bills piled up to the sky
Another day, another dollar
When the rent do again and the trap ain‚Äôt bumping
A nigga got to figure out something
Another day, another dollar

[Verse 1 ‚Äì Scotty ATL]
A dope boy tell me if he standing on the corner all morning
And his pocket look funny, I reply eye to eye
If the product 100 and the fiends ain‚Äôt coming
Something wrong with your hustle, I ain‚Äôt lying
[?] it look like a disc stuck, between your headlights
And rap [?] got it wrong in your head right
Everybody selling bricks in the city, that‚Äôs bullshit
Niggas ain‚Äôt even paying rent right
And this the good word, I put the stank on it
You can trust em but I wouldn‚Äôt really bank on it
Most of them got a scheme up their sleeve
They finessing, they‚Äôll leave [?] nigga at the bank homie
And he was throwed out, he dropped out of school
Said his mama on drugs, tryna get some shoes
I felt bad for the homie cause I know he tryna get it
So I told him keep your head to the ceiling

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Gipp]
Rap got 9, Erick got 10
You can buy the whole truck if you come the weekend
Uncle junior still on the porch, he selling that hooch
I can scrape the plate, make you sell the shake
Dixie Hill still got poor birds, I put a call in, got no word
Half the streets stay lying, half the dope wet
The molly ain‚Äôt real, this some crushed up pills
Now how the fuck I feel, this world out here, ain‚Äôt shit here real
I should‚Äôve went to school, should‚Äôve got a job
Should‚Äôve heard mom, made me want to rob
You don‚Äôt know the feeling
When your stomach touch your back, you don‚Äôt know the feeling
Make an honest man go out and do the killing
This the life I‚Äôm living

[Hook]

[Verse 3 ‚Äì Scotty ATL]
Mike [?], he be living in a small town
See in a small town everybody compound
Everybody in your biz, everybody always [?]
Mike got locked up, a lot of pounds
It knocked the wind out me, cause I been going through it
And I was looking up to Mike, how they bang Cook?
I‚Äôm on the brink of blowing up, still tryna keep my head
All I need is some matches and some lighter fluid
They took my role model,that shit happens every day
Meanwhile at the crib I just pray
I want to grab a chopper and amass
Hit the gas on the Chevy, tryna come up on another nigga‚Äôs cash
Naw, thought about it, took a couple pulls
Girl blowing up my phone, she be stressing too
It only take you one shot leave a nigga paralyzed
Living the rest of your life as a vegetable
I pulled up on him, pistol in my hand
He had his head down, I‚Äôm slowly creeping in
Yanked the hood off his head, it was pastor from the church
Said he just prayed for me, keep working

[Hook][Hook] 2x
Never let the money and these broads break us
We right here 'til the Lord take us
We act a fool cuz the laws make us
"Baby.. You can't stop the hustle"

[Backbone]
You walk your ass 'cross my yard - get off my grass
You wanna get to that money - get off yo' ass
You wantsta know my name - you awsta ask
If you wanna see me for somethin - it's gon' cost ya cash
I see ya pokin outcha jeans girl you actin bad
Oooh, do that again wit'cha nasty ass
I caught her comin out the mall, with 2 or 3 bags
Now shawty got her at the wood shack, throwin her back
Champagne, chicken wings, and bubblebath
Catch me somewhere outta town signin autographs
Still workin street corners, straight servin them blacks
Them thirty-two fifth it for four and a half
I prefer a Cheverolet, when it's time to mash
And I smoke the 'dro weed, a hundred dollars a sack
I put up the big numbers nigga, check the stats
And I'm on the microphone with Gipp, Slimm, and Cass

[Hook] 2x

[Big Gipp]
Since the trashman only run once a week
If I miss it, I'm wait 'til night and dump it up the street
Behind the Winn-Dixie
Quiver, never step or kept up his penny drawers
To get an applause, appeared to have no flaws
In the situation, no dentation, smellin good
But I ain't gonna feel her, touchin up would be too easy
Sleazy, measly, lookin ugly like a person tryna sell me a dub
Fool A, C, D, and me
Trees ain't my reason for sendin your ass to grave and
Watch you say the grade is..
Burn like acid reflux, somebone'll order up the Pheffer chickens
While I order up a smoked duck (Thank You)
Get the gas to go, at the corner sto'
Keep my hand on the nine piece
In case somebody wanna disturb the peace (Always keepin my eyes open)
Uhh, cuz you, can't, stop the hustle

[Hook] 2x

[Slimm Calhoun]
Well I'm known for my shine, Southside
Eyes on the prize, it's Mr. Fly Guy
Mobbin, '68 Chevy, door vault ties
Jumped out muggin like I'm holdin twenty pies
Rocked up, work on the block
We keep it, chopped up in the spot, in the pot
Where we keep it, stocked up from the Frosty Flakes
To the chickens in the cake
If I drop it on the tool, it must be weight
Went with two and a quarter, came back with eight
Let Juke lick the plate, I re-rock the shape
Like it hot in the kitchen nigga, oven on bake
Got gorillas with banana clips, who love to go apes
Southpaw, side-strapped, known to leave yellow tape
Try and stop the hustle and crushed like grapes
Just for the taste... Just for the taste..

[Hook] 4x

Uh-uh (Uh-huh)
"Baby, you can't stop the hustle"
[Repeat until fade][Verse One: Pimp C]
Uh, hold up smoke something bitch, uh, uh
Everybody want to know why the album was late
I was waiting for whitey to get fucking paper straight
I'm an underground king nigga, lets my nuts hang
Nigga saying I'm only in (????) Ain't no thang nigga
Everybody rappin like they ballin' and they rich
I see em' in the streets, I ain't believing that shit
They diamonds ain't shining, and they Rolex ain't real
While I'm gripping on this grain, sippin' lean and poppin' pills
Fuck how them bitches feel, I'm working wood wheel
In a 2000 Seville your stepdaddy can get killed
If he keeps talking shit, ain't no thang to get hit
On your video you trill, on your record you trying to diss
But everywhere we go, we represent the south
For Them niggas and Them girls with them golds in they mouth
Them boys with them P's and O's in they house
It's all about the trill bitch you ain't what this about...about...about

[Hook: Bun B]
When you see me on the street, nigga don't say shit
Blowin' big on the sweep, nigga don't say shit
Everybody want the ice and everybody want to ball
But everybody ain't trill so we ain't fucking with y'all
When I see you at the show, nigga don't say shit
Acting bad with ya ho, nigga don't say shit
Everybody want the ice and everybody want to ball
But everybody ain't trill so we ain't fucking with y'all

[Verse Two: Bun B]
Say, nigga ain't got shit to hide
I ain't got nothing to prove
We ain't got nothing to gain but I got everything to lose
So I'm forever bring the blues to the issue
Pick and choose if I miss ya, stick and move when I diss ya
Disapprove we can get ya and your bullshit, I be the same
The game will never be the same, It was made for me yo gain
You see the thangs for me to name I go by, so fly, oh my, flow sly
Wait awhile you know why (Why?) too many niggas pop collars and drop dollars
Baby ballin' bullshitter frontin' like rottweiliers
No bark, no bite, but showing thangs
Talking loud like they knowing thangs
I'm from Texas nigga, all we do is blow them thangs
Fuck your clique, your corner, your city, your last name
Stuck in the fast lane,(????) your ass mane
Bask at the light, blast at the day, blast at the night
Got your ass in a fight
It ain't no passing tonight

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Big Gipp of Goodie Mob]
People waiting, some be hating, I'll be shaking, they'll be faking
Waiting for me to fall, but yet they comin' off the wall
Till I'm ready keep that gun steady and ready
For anybody crossing the line with that fuck shit
I got a (????), got a ho, got a trunk with the funk
Got the radio on pump when I come through a slump
Remember me? The one that had your back up in the club?
Remember me? The one that bring you on and show you love?
Remember me? The one that rolled by deep in a cadillina
With a rusty ass niner looking for trouble
So what? I know the same streets you know
Yeah so what? I go the same places you go
I got the mark in my skin so you know my set
I'm the heart, you the place, I'm always first, you always late
I'm the king in these streets till the muthafucking end
So you fuck with me, you gotta fuck with my friend

[Hook][Hook]
I know, I know, I know, I know pain [x 16]

[Verse 1]
Let it be known Gipp love to bury muffins with no stuffin
Problem child to this industry like David Ruffin
155 pounds going straight in your kisser
And take a position [?] I started rollin [?]
Pick up a penny hope it turn into a twenny but the day end home[?]
A classic in the street like Reebok
Grew up on the human beatbox, I kick the door up off the hinge
I roll the windows to the ceiling
Been on a mission, dealing with my feelings like Max Payne
Analytically driven, emotionally living in pain
If I had to do it oversee I do it again
I know

[Hook]
I know, I know, I know, I know pain [x 16]

[Verse 2]
I do this for the kids
I do this for the mommas
I do this for the children that ain't ever had a father
Too many to remember mentally but yo I try
Sometimes I'm blinded by the cataracs up in my eye
Like Little Bo Peep, she standing in the street
And even ain't got no shoes for them mutilated feet
Good Golly Miss Molly, addicted to Bacardi
Don't even know the difference between love and a party
And old men con young women, thats wrong
Don't they know the 30s and the 40s been gone
Inconspicously, I slide to the side on
[?] I hypnotize through the voice tone
Already been, confronted myself to transcend
Tales from an adolescent years to young teens
When everything I used to own used to sit on the dresser
I rode the bus to [?] the train
I know the rain, I know the pain
Construction jobs kept callouses on my hand
I know the pain
Crystalize me to a man
I know the pain
Believe in something higher then man
I know the pain
When it didn't work I fell on my knees and called his name

[Hook] To Fade
I know, I know, I know, I know pain [x 16](Big Gipp talking)
Hello what's happening world?
Yo this Big Gipp I've been called down
By Lil' Jon & The Eastside Boyz
To tell you what's really happening
On these streets in the A-town man
Cause you know a lot of shit going on
A lot of flaw, a lot of people moving up
A lot of people moving down
You know what I mean, but after this
I'm a tell you the truth now

Now after these 12 bars the world is gonna know a few facts
And after these 12 bars you might get your shoulders in your laps
See the neighborhood boys and the economy getting worse
The candy lady jumping fifties outta Easter purse
Bill Kammer gone, Shirley Franklin in
The GC closed down, Mike Chiles got ten
The feds locked the pimps up for pimpin in the south
You may control her mind, but you can't control her mouth
And these R&B stars having sex with the kids
Need to be chopped up and castrated and served to the pigs
Oh yeah homeboy, you big time in yo state
But around here sucker, you get squeezed like grapes
This a word to the wise, the gravy get chunky
Somebody will pull that steel, throw it up an get funky
I got that Wayne rims, Winnie the Pooh and Mr. Miyagi
And horse tranquilizers that will fuck up your body
The wolves out hunting they looking for new meat
Better gather up your guns and keep yo chillin out the street
I said the mutant's out hunting, he looking for fresh meat
Better gather up your guns and keep yo chillin out the street, nigga

(Big Gipp talking to end)[Too $hort]
I chose to live this life

[Devin the Dude - singing]
I be stickin this dick up in these hoes hoes
'til a couple of bitches bitches get caught by they niggas

[Devin the Dude]
Niggas trippin - and for what?
Why must he think he 'posed to change her
When she'll give the pussy up even to a, total stranger
And, I'm just one of 'em, you can't trust none of them
They'll say they love you while they wipin your cum on them
Then they'll run and tell her friends how she found another sucker
To pay a fee for pus-sy but not - me, motherfuckahHHH
I move quick with my pool stick, Slicker than Willie
Slicker than Kelly, slicker than KY Jelly
But really this dick has got me in a lot of trouble recently
I bend 'em and go in 'em and don't even have the decency
To call her, my balls have been leaked of most of their fluids
I used to put the rubber on and skeet straight through it
And it seems, that I always keep my pipe in these hoes
Keep my mic at these shows, cause that's the life that I chose

[Devin the Dude - singing]
Pimp life!
I chose to live the - pimp life!

[Bun B of U.G.K.]
Come talk a walk up in my shoes, pay a couple of my dues
Roll my boulevard on trues, while your lady sings the blues
Got everythang to lose, not a damn thang to gain
I be tryin to cross the line, but with that I gotta bring the pain
Now I tried to compromise, see the other side of the story
But that's easier said that done, when it comes to your pride & your glory
I'm a pimp with a glide in my worries, limp pimp I'ma step when I wreck
But my armor's on at all times, cause I gots me a rep to protect
Now I mights be known for this, and maybe recognized for that
But they be high-beamin me; and I be like where my visors at?
Nowadays I'm a wiser cat, after what I been through I better be
Back then I woulda broke ya broad, nowadays I just let her be
Cause through seconds minutes hours days weeks months and years
Man I reckon that it's power fuckin freaks blunts and beers
That ain't what I'm supposed to be

[Devin] Pimp life!
[Bun B] That's the life I chose for me

[Devin the Dude - singing]
I be stickin this dick up in these hoes hoes
'til a couple of bitches bitches get caught by they niggas
Niggas trippin

[$hort] I chose to live the
[Devin] Pimp life!

[Too $hort]
Yeah I have menage-a-trois with superstars, one night stands, quickies
Booty calls, it ain't nuttin for her to just stick around here and lick me
Cause I run through broads and never get enough, maybe I'm too selfish
But I cain't help it.. can't stay witchu girl cause I can't tell if it's
Official, or just another ritual
It's hard for me to find a wife, it's nothin for me to, get a ho
I know it sounds, pitiful, sometimes I'm blessed, sometimes I'm cursed
If it's supposed to be the best then tell me, what's the worst?
I'll be a P-F-L, 'til I'm a old nigga
Cause I never spend my life with groupies, or golddiggers
I see these bitches now, shake it naked tryin to make it
If you spendin all his money take it bitch you can't fake it
When it's real, I'm cappin like the snub-nosed, they pay me
I love hoes, never go home when the club close
I do shows, ride new vogues and keep two hoes
I'm all about this money girl, that's why I chose
To live the pimp life

[Devin] Pimp life!
[$hort] I chose to live this life
[Devin] Pimp life.. pimp life!
[Devin] I chose to live the, pimp life

[Big Gipp]
People ask me question bout this, people ask me question bout that
Say what? I'm a handsome John motherfucker independent of the nasty-ass cuts
Young, Gipp, still around the corner in the hood
Gipp, still runnin down in the wood
Gipp, still ridin out like vogues
Gipp, still cruise hundred spokes
Straight from the 80's ladies
Grew up in nuttin but dem Grady babies
Pimpin the game since ninety-six
Can't sell a big ol' pimp no box of bricks
Gipp put it down for the A-Town to the Bay to the Oakland foothill strip
Too $hort, Bun B, Devin and Big Gipp yo we all some pimps
Gettin money out the sexual industries
At the same, tryin to get our slice
Never lookin back twice - livin in the pimp life

[Devin] Pimp life!

[Devin the Dude - singing]
I be stickin this dick up in these hoes hoes
'til a couple of bitches bitches get caught by they niggas

[$hort] I chose to live the
[Devin] Pimp life!  Pimp life.. {*fades out*}[Intro: Pimp C]
Already bitch
Trunk full of yay bitch, P.A. to H-Town nigga
Get on yo' money motherfucker
It's really goin down in the South
Sweet Jones biatch!

[Hook x2: Pimp C]
(Uhh) Flippin' and dippin', sippin' and grain grippin'
Watch him lie through my rearview mirror, I ain't trippin'
I done rolled with the best and acted bad in the worst
Dick is a commodity bitch the purse come first

[Pimp C:]
They say they with animals, my mouth is perverse
Ain't overstandin us nigga, my life ain't rehearsed
Ain't no rewind button like DVD
They never show the real neighborhood on TV (TV)
Ours ain't prison and "The Wire" ain't dope
President is the supplier, government got all the coke
Wouldn't depend on Noriega is it wasn't for no Reagan (Reagan)
While all the Christian holidays the same day as the Pagans (as the Pagans)
I look like this, I don't talk it, I make 'em think I'm dumb
I keep dick out they eyes, don't see where I'm cummin' from
I lay between thighs, she put it in her mouth and hum
Life is a pussy motherfucker, I'm gon' get me some

[Hook]

[Bun B:]
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane (plane)
No it's just another drone spyin on us mayne (mayne)
It's a new world order, at least that's what I read (read)
And big brother is watchin, I just heard somebody said
Jesus was married to Mary (Mary) and they both had a kid (kid)
And it's a piece of history that the Catholic church hid (hid)
Man fuck the Da Vinci code, fuck Illuminati~!
Only secret society is Rap-A-Lot and John Gotti (Gotti)
This Halliburton contracts and war profiteerin' (teerin)
With Cheney on the board, is you motherfuckers hearin'? (hearin)
They send us off to war, kill our kids and got paid to
America, open yo' eyes (for real) these niggas played you (man)
And played me too, shit I pay taxes (taxes)
They let these bitches wage war against the evil axis (axis)
Pull up all the e-mails, memos and the faxes (faxes)
So we can really see what all the facts is, you bastards

[Hook]

[Big Gipp:]
Yea, yea, yea
"Now where ya been Gipp? " Gonnnne 'round the world with Nelly
Leave it up in her jelly, swisha sweet we blowin smelly
We don't blog, we don't surf, we don't search neither
We don't trust, we don't pass, we just touch people
We hit 'em three times, ain't lyin/line like Adidas
Surrounded by killers and dealers and club geekers
Summertime, Dapper Dan, candy ridin coupes
Wintertime, snow suits with the Louie boots
See the purse came first, the love came later
The pussy got wet and captain D came greater
I do it for the Bun and I do it for the Pimp
For the hustlers and the gangstas doin' time behind the fence

[Hook]
