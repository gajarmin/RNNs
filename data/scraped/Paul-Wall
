[Hook: Kanye West]
Drive slow, homie
Drive slow, homie
You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My homie Marley used to stay at 79th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet, a school for the Stones
He nicknamed me K-Rock so they would leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
Keys in his hand, reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked Ellesses, he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers, even more by polices
How'd he get the cash? The day his father passed away
Left him with a lil' somethin, 16 he was stuntin'
Al B. Sure nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lake Shore, girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway, go at least 'bout eighty
Boned so much that summer, even had him a baby
See back-back then-then, if you had a car
You was the Chi-Town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin, a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
We'd take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had they Lincolns and Auroras, we was hurtin 'em all
With the girls a lot of flirtin' involved, but dog
Fuck all that flirtin', I'm tryin' to get in some drawers
So put me on with these hoes, homie
He told me don't rush to get grown, drive slow, homie

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
What it do? I'm posted up in the parking lot, my trunk waving
The candy gloss is immaculate, it's simply amazing
Them elbows pokin' wide on that candy 'Lac
Trunk open, screens on, neons lit with fifth relaxed
I'm on a mission for dime-pieces and sexy ladies
Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes
It's a star-studded event when I valet park
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
You see them fours crawling? You see them screens falling?
The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin'
I'm leaning on the switch, sitting crooked in my slab
But I could still catch boppers if I drove a cab
A young Houston hardhitter all about the scrilla
Ridin' something candy coated, crawling like a caterpillar
I'm tipping on them fours, I'm jamming on that Screw
I'm looking for them hoes, baby, what it do? Drive slow, homie

[Interlude: GLC]
Turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes
If you're riding around the city with nowhere to go
Live today, cause tomorrow, man, you never know

[Hook]

[Bridge: Kanye West]
My car's like the movie, my car's like the crib
I got more TVs in here than where I live

[Verse 3: GLC]
And that don't make no sense, but baby, I'm the shit
And everything I flip, you know it's something serious
I got the custom grill, I got the Brabus rims
I got the baller genetics, baby, this evidence
You see a player flicking, and how you ain't convinced
That you should go on and kiss it, just a lil bit (just a lil bit)
I got my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chain
My canaries is gleamin' through my angel wings
They see me, hoes actin like they seen a king
With that mean lean, smoking on that finest Cali green
My woodgrain oak, I'm ridin on Vogues
My cylinder quiet, like tip-toes
I sold O's, and this I know
When you see them hoes, lil' homie, drive slow

[Outro/Hook][Hook]
Still Tippin' on four fours, wrapped in four vogues
Tippin' on four fours, wrapped in four vogues
Tippin' on four fours wrapped in four vogues
Pimping four hoes and I'm packing four fours

[Slim Thug]
Now look who creeping, look who crawling still balling in the mix
It's that six six long dick slim nigga sticking your chick
Pullin tricks looking slick at all times when I'm flipping
Barre sipping, car dipping, Grant wood grain gripping
Still tippin' on four fours wrapped in four vogues
Pimping four hoes and I'm packing four fours
Blowing on the endo GameCube Nintendo
Five percent tint so you can't see up in my window
These niggas don't understand me cuz I'm Boss Hogg on candy
Top down at Maxi's wit a big Glock nine handy
Pieced up creased up staying dressed to impress
Big boss belt buckle under my Mitchell and Ness
Oh, Gucci shades up on my braids when I Escalade
When I'm riding Sprewells sliding like a escapade
I got it made the big boss of the north
Ain't shit changed I still represent SwishaHouse (Ha!)

[Hook - 2x]

[Mike Jones]
Four fours I'm tippin'
Wood grain I'm gripping
Catch me lane switching with the paint dripping
Turn your neck and your dame missing
Me and Slim we ain't trippin' I'm finger flippin' and syrup sippin'
Like do or die I'm po' pimping car stop rims keep spinning
I'm flipping drop with indvisible tops
Hoes bop when my drop step out
I'm shaking the block with four eighteens'
Candy green with eleven screens
My gasoline always supreme
Got do-do to burn with a pint of lean
It takes grinding to be a king
It takes grinding to be a king
First Round Draft Picks coming
Who is Mike Jones coming
Slab shining with the grill and woman
Slab shining with the grill and woman
I'm Mike Jones (who?) Mike Jones the one and only you can't clone me
Got a lot a haters and a lot of homies some friends and some phony
Back then hoes didn't want me, now I'm hot hoes all on me
Back then hoes didn't want me, now I'm hot hoes all on me
Back then hoes didn't want me, now I'm hot hoes all on me (I said!)
Back then hoes didn't want me, now I'm hot hoes all on me

[Hook - 2x]

[Paul Wall]
What it do it's Paul Wall I'm the People's Champ
My chain light up like a lamp cause now I'm back with the camp
I'm crawling similar to an ant, cause I'm low to the Earth
People's feelings get hurt when they figure out what I'm worth
I got eighty fours poking out at the club I'm showing out
I'm a player ain't no doubt hoes want to know what I'm bout
Biggest diamonds off in my mouth princess cuts all in my chain
Wood grain all in my range dripping stains when I switch lanes
Switched the name It's still the same SwishaHouse or SwishaBlast
Mike Jones, he running the game and Magnificent bout his cash
Michael Watts he made me hot hard work took me to the top
G. Dash took me to the lot he wrote a check and bought a drop
I got the internet going nuts
But T. Farris got my back so now I'm holding my nuts
It's Paul Wall baby what you know bout me
I'm on that five nine Southlea baby holla at me

[Hook - 2x]

Â Rob the jewelry store and tell 'em make me a grill
Add the whole top diamond and the bottom row's gold

[J.D.]
Yo we bout to start a epidemic wit this one
Y'all know what this is... So So Def

[Nelly]
Got 30 down at the bottom, 30 more at the top
All invisible set in little ice cube blocks
If I could call it a drink, call it a smile on the rocks
If I could call out a price, let's say I call out a lot
I got like platinum and white rose, traditional gold
I'm changing grills everyday, like Jay change clothes
I might be grilled out nicely (oh) In my white tee (oh)
Or on South Beach (oh) in my wife beat
VVS studded, you can tell when they cut it
You see my grandmama hate it, but my lil mama love it
Cause when I...

[Brandy]
Open up ya mouth, ya grill gleaming (say what)
Eyes stay low from the chiefing (chiefing)

[Nelly]
I got a grill they call penny candy, you know what that means
It look like Now and Laters, gum drops, jelly beans
I wouldn't leave it for nothing only a crazy man would
So if you catch me in your city, somewhere out in your hood
Just say...

[Hook]
Smile for me daddy (What you looking at)
Let me see ya grill (Let me see my what)
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill (Rob the jewelry store and tell 'em make me a grill)
Smile for me daddy (What you looking at)
I want to see your grill (You wanna see my what)
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill (Had a whole top diamonds and the bottom rows gold)

[Paul Wall]
What it do baby, it's the ice man Paul Wall
I got my mouth looking something like a disco ball
I got the diamonds and the ice all hand set
I might cause a cold front if I take a deep breath
My teeth gleaming like I'm chewing on aluminum foil
Smiling showing off my diamonds sipping on some potent oil
I put my money where my mouth is and bought a grill
20 carats 30 stacks let 'em know I'm so for real
My motivation is from 30 pointers, VVS
The frontage in my mouth piece simply symbolize success
I got the wrist wear and neck wear that's captivating
But it's what smile that's got these onlookers spectating
My mouth piece simply certified a total package
Open up my mouth and you see more carrots than a salad
My teeth are mind blowing giving everybody chills
Call me George Foreman cause I'm selling everybody grills

[Hook]

[Gipp]
Gipp got them yellows, got them purples, got them reds
Lights gon' hit and make you woozy in your head
You can catch me in my 2 short drop
Mouth got colors like a Fruit Loop box

[Ali]
It's what it do, in the Lou', ice grill, country grammar
Where the hustlers move bricks and the gangsters bang hammers
Where I got 'em you can spot 'em, on the top, on the bottom
Got a bill in my mouth like I'm Hillary Rodham

[Gipp]
I ain't dissing nobody but lets bring it to the light
Gipp was the first with my mouth bright white
Yeah these hoes can't focus cause they eyesight blurry
Tipping on some 4's you can see my mouth jewelry

[Ali]
I got four different sets its a fabulous thang
One white, one yellow, like Fabolous chain
And the other set the same got my name in the mold
(Had a whole top diamonds and the bottom row's gold)

[Hook]

[Brandy]
Boy, how you get grill that way
And how much did you pay
Every time I see you
Tha first thing I'm gon' say hey.....

[Hook][Hook]
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
On a Sunday night I might bring me some haze

[Intro]
Swisha House, Big Pokey and Paul Wall, baby

[Verse 1]
It's the People's Champ, I'm something like a baller
The candy paint dripping off of the old school Impala
I'm with that Big Bank Hank, that Poppa Joe and Box
Trunk bump like chicken pox, turn the bass up just a notch
You see them blades choppin', you see that trunk poppin'
Hoes that diss me in the club, the same hoes in the parking lot boppin'
They see me in the Jag, acting bad with T. Farris
Open mouth and showcase ice, and you gon' see about 20 karats
I'm with that Gu U on 5-9-double-O
In the Tahoe on 24's I'm the truth, I got that glow
I'm out that Swisha House with Archie Lee and Coota Bang
Sittin' sideways on swang, the candy paint dripping off the frame
You see me acting bad, I'm showing out and pulling stunts
Say "cheese" and show my fronts, it's more karats than Bugs Bunny's lunch
It's Paul Wall baby, I got it made
I got a cup full of that oil and I'm paid plus I'm...

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
What it do, I'm on the block posted up like a mailbox
Slanging licks on the grind, putting money in my socks
A legend in the hood for gold grills and poppin' seals
A icon on the mic for showcasing my verbal skills
I'm in the club posted up with some gangbangers
Still flipping the old school candy Cadillac on swangers
I got a styrofoam white cup full of that drank
Looking for that dank, my hustle game sharp as a shank
Big bank take little bank, 84's and candy paint
Tryna find some Honey Love, my macking game is top rank
These hoes peeping me, ear hustling on the side
Eavesdropping my conversation, tryna figure which car I drive
I'm on the scene strapped up like I was bungee jumping
Hit the corner you hear me bumping, look at that cold grill and woman
The trunks popped up, my music screwed and chopped
I'm the undisputed king of the parking lot, I'm...

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Pokey]
Maybe O'Jays, hoes be going crazy when they see me
Sittin' sideways on them 24's, watch ya ho
Bunch of money, bunch of clothes, Cigarillos, Optimos
Glidin' like a ice skater, motor like a snot nose
Suicide drop doors, mono blocks, chop mold
Customized deck, cause the mono block stock lows
Sensei, Don 'Ke, Paul Wall in the place
Heads up when you see us, we gon' put it in ya face
Raised on Scott in the Yella
When I blaze, boys smell lemon haze, I ain't the nigga to settle
I'm that dude with the metal, that get hot as a kettle
From messing 'round with some cat that ain't got it together
Flossing, breaking off intersection, crossing
Three-wheelin' acting a iz-ass on them Bosses
S.U.C. in the door, M.O.B. on the plate
Pull up in the driveway leanin' and I'm...

[Hook][Intro: Theophilus London]
Where the weather is warm

[Verse 1]
Moonlight move when a nigga dance
Peep a nigga steeze from a nigga stance
Had to leave home wasnât working out
Kiss moms for me if you get a chance
Walk the streets where I stay
Niggas give me daps and pounds they canât wait
In the moonlight you canât see my eyes
And when Iâm off the things I canât think
Man I been coasting the coast
Swear a young nigga done been through the most
Washing my mind out with dope
Shit real, but you know a nigga canât choke
When they recognize a real nigga still
Ride with me, down with me, say he a float
And all my real niggas sitting in the VIP
Shoving champagne through the next girl throat

[Hook: Theophilus London]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Letâs get high, and go dance on the moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
We could fly, and go straight to the moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Touch the sky, and go dance on the moon
Where the weather is warm and we forever live long

[Verse 2]
Lost in the moonlight, run through the moon like new
Cop lights, no lights, cause the bills they was over due
Now a skinny iggy nigga got fits from the runway
Taking trips to the side of the moon
I just take trips to define my peace
But I got a little feeling it might be in that tomb
I like my weed in the cheese, roll that that a little thick
Better watch your toke, you donât wanna choke
Better let that jack roll down your neck
Iâm on some popular shit, come look in my eyes and get a fix
We just go'n cruise hit the brews, lay back don't worry bout shit
It might get rowdy cause all the freaky models wanna party
All the freaky models in the lobby, it's so obvious that they lobbyist
Man it canât be realer, me and my niggas in the villa
She in that white dress it canât fit her
Sweet not bitter, drink like you got no liver
Hit it and she on the moon my nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Paul Wall]
Paul Wall, two cups, hold up, hold up
Iâm headed to the moon cause the world screwed up
Like the city I grew up so
Iâm pouring up a co-cup, 'bout to get tore up
Got a Xanax crushed up
If you steal my cup, it'll get you fucked up
Pull up to the moon with the trunk up
Gettin' sucked up with three blunts rolled up
Smoke all three at the same time: call that triple OG
In the triple D I'm full when Iâm on E, you donât know nothing 'bout me
Back wood feel with a Compton tree
Getting full of that oil, I got gas and grease
Three lines poured up in the big East
Baptized a blunt but I ainât no priest
Peach Ciroc with a Norco, piece of hash and my trippy sticks
OG wax on a bone with a skillet, me and Paskel been doing that shit
Def' rocking link, what you know about this
Baby bass came through with the kush assist
Percocet ten and a soma twist on the moon
Getting higher than a bitch and Iâm doing my dance

[Hook][Verse 1: Slim Thug]
Now welcome to the city of game, piece of chains and swangs
Pop, trunk and bang, yeah I'm still here mayne
Born and raised on the stead block, braids no dreadlocks
Married to the hood, me and Scenic Woods wedlock
Acres Homes my home, I'm a Northside veteran
Repping H-Town, smoking, sipping on some medicine
Ain't nobody better than the boss when I floss
It's Slim Thugga motherfucker, still breaking boys off

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
Got plenty cheese plenty carats, man we looking like some caterers
And its looking like you haters and you fakes is imitating us
Shaded up, braided up, and I bet that trunk be bladed up
Bentley still crawling on fo's so they ain't fading us
In the hood I'm a grinder, wood on the vinyl
TV, VCR, I'm laid back with your mama
You ain't never seen a grinder that grind the way I grind, huh?
Top of my drop still missin' as Osama

[Hook: Chamillionaire]
(Still breaking boys off, hmm) Candy painted with the gloss
You can hate but that's the way a player floss
(Still breaking boys off, hmm) Getting money's what I'm bout
I'ma get it while these haters just talk
(Still breaking boys off, hmm) Gotta do it for the north
Gotta do it for my hustlers in the south
(Still breaking boys off, boys off, still breaking boys off)
And when I do it I'ma do it like a boss (still breaking boys off)

[Verse 3: Mike Jones]
I still represent H-Town, the city of that candy
They see me with a lotta cars but they don't understand it
They say the never seen ya boy out here gettin his grind on
Phantom, Bentley, take ya pick, yeah I'm gettin' my shine on
I've sold 2 million records now my paper all swole now
The mayor of the city, top down when I roll now
H-town, home of the candy paint
Home of the 84's and vogues and the purple drank

[Verse 4: Bun B]
Yeh this the city thats slow, the city thats thowed
The city where the boys flip the candy painted low
The city where they blow big killa and stayed blowed
Hustling ass D-boys got the game sewed
And sip that paint (sip that paint) and drip that paint (drip that paint)
And drop that top (drop that top) and grip that grain (hold up)
6-10, I-10, 59, 45, and da belt
This Clutch City but we play what we delt
Reppin the H-Town

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Paul Wall]
Hustle town's my home, it's where I do my dirt
Where the gangtstas smoke water with drank stains on they shirt
We ride swangin', chops blades just to break boys off
From South Park to the Southwest and all the way to that north
I'm talking Tidwell and Carverdale and Greenspoint too
From Denver Harbor to West Airport and all the way to Channelview
We steady bangin on this screw, it's chopping like kung fu
Hit me on the 8-3-2, it's Paul Wall wat it do baby

[Verse 6: Yung Redd]
(Heheh, nahmtawkinbout?)
Purple so muddy I can barely even drive
Stay blowin down trees like a Category 5
Southside of H-Town the heart of Sunny Side
I could walk these streets if I was blind, nahmtawkinbout?
Yung Reedd, take ya out the future
Stars imitate swear to God I was a jewler
Robert Davis, Fat Pat, this for you
To my homie Big Hawk, I salute
MAYNE!!!

[Hook]

[Verse 7: Lil Keke]
H-O to the U-S, T-O to the N
God blessed me with the million dollar pen
See them quiet money gangstas with they hand in the air
That Sunny Side and South Park, I was raised out there
This is H-Town (H-Town), screwed up and slowed down
It's all love homie, keep rolling up the whole pound
Pull up in the monster just look at him hiding
Don Ke' heart of the south, slab riding

[Verse 8: Z-Ro]
H-O-U-S-T-O-N, T-E-X-A-S
We go get it and come back with it until we take our last breath
From the city where our stadiums drop the top
Z-Ro the Crooked, my ghetto pass is good in any hood, any block they got
The white cup is for the codeine and the cigarillo is for the kush
If you want it we got it cause there's not a product we dont push
We used to be the dirty south, now we so dirty we filthy
So homie you must be touching it wrong if you don't feel me (you don't feel me)

[Hook]

[Verse 9: Mike D]
Welcome to H-Town, this 3rd Ward talking
Coming down the slab line the fo's crip walking
Together we stand, divided we fall, yeah
North and the south together we ball
Fuck that, nigga its a H-Town thang
Lemme see ya touch the sky if ya feeling me mayne
Its Boss Hogg Corleone, nigga that Mike D
The drank man daddy, you know where to find me

[Verse 10: Big Pokey]
State to state dawg, I got em jockin the kid
6' backin out the driveway, dropping the wig
Yall know we do it big, like a freightliner rig
Got stashes full of cash where I keep the money hid
Fresh to death homie, how I came in the do'
Prada shades on, smelling like a swanger of dro
Put'cha H'es up, represent'cha city bro
Counting money, iced out, like I'm in a video

[Hook]

[Verse 11: Rob G]
(Talking) Southwest put'cha dubs up baby, let's go!
Now welcome to the place I love, place I was raised to be a G
It's straight hang with thugs, jam my music slow and hold my H's up
Southwest SWAT I know the real dudes that move birdies
I go to school early, baby blue Moon jersey
Riding around, southwest side of my towm
Still Reppin' My Block, How Ya Likin Me Now
Its from Sharpstown, Braeswood to Alief
Black and Latins stacking paper together we stay deep
It's Rob G!

[Verse 12: Trae]
Cheyah!
King of the Streets and I'm roll around Houston ridin 4's
Boys better chill 'fore this throw-away leave they curtains closed (lights out)
I'm in the slab but I'm tippin it like a platinum Rolls
Suicide make the door presidential when they decide to close (real talk)
They want the throne but tell the haters that I got it locked (got it locked)
I shoot em on the west so whatever all they way to the block (doors up)
I'm so hood it be the true definition of me
Ain't no way speak about the H, without mentioning me
Tha Truth, nigga!

[Hook]

[Verse 13: Lil O]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Ay I'm from H-Town, southwest stop drop and roll
If I chunk the dub up, the whole hood rock n roll
Braaeswood, Woolfair, Clull Creek, Spice Lane
West Bellville, Fondren Airport, Sandpiper, stack change
I'm so H-Town there's codeine in my blood
And I done shout it out at war with with the meanest of thugs
And you ain't never gotta ask if there's lean in my cup
I'm a triple O.G., S.U.C. nigga what
Its Lil O Homie

[Verse 14: Pimp C]
Now I'm from Port Arthur, Texas, 90 miles away
For the last 15 years, I been reppin my state
I knew the real DJ Screw sip grape by the case
Eight's over ice straight product of the H
Southside, I never was no big socializer
With Bun you can talk, I fuck with the boss
Like Thug and Prince Silvia Rome or Wrice
This game a pie I dont want it all I just need a slice

[Hook][Hook: RiFF RaFF x2]
Show you how to be the man, how to be the boss
How to come through with seven coats of the gloss
Show you how to be the man, show you how to be the man
Show you how to be the man, how to be the boss
How to buy the car, how to buy the house
Show you how to be the man, show you how to be the man

[Verse 1: Slim Thug]
I could show you how to be the boss
I could show them boys how we ride on that North
So clean top off, looking good
Still comin' down tippin' fours through the hood
Whipping on the wood in that cocaine Mulsanne
Could buy another Mulsanne if I sold my chain
Old school Y-frame seven coats of the gloss
Thugga been the boss since I left Swisha House
Break 'em off, Top Texas, drive slabs reckless
Wake up every day to bad bitches and breakfast
Boss Life, better get your money right
Me and RiFF RaFF pouring fours in the Sprite
With your bitch, burning bowls after light
Paul Wall called to say it's going down tonight
H-Town, North Side Thugga
I could show you boys how to hustle

[Hook]

[Verse 2: RiFF RaFF]
Yeah a chain with the charm, Versace car alarm
Roll though your city smelling like a thunderstorm
Teleport to Prom, python on my arm
But don't get me wrong I want the world in my palm
Crawl like ant farm, I'm crawling like a baby
Pop trunk on Antoine, I let it down in Katy
The candy grey Mercedes, I sold it at an auction
Rap Game Sadie Hawkins, got a ticket for jay-walking
If I had a option, I'd pick all of the above
Oriental rugs and I'm flyer than a dove
You could show me love, or you can get lost
Four-story houses, I recline on Prada couch
Shark grill in mouth, better watch your language
Paul Wall and Johnny got me frozen like a penguin
Colder than a polar, Jody Husky sandals
Slide down 45 in the black licorice Lambo

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Paul Wall]
I show you how to get muddy on sunny day
Drop a soma in your soda if you want to play
Pour a four in a twenty like a shot clock
48 for the watch, hundred dollar socks
Getting money is an understatement
I pay the Corvette for the matching bracelet
Half a million worth of jewelry, it's high maintenance
Getting full of more meds than a cancer patient
I could show you how to grind like a brake pad
I got a hundred acre island with a helipad
No key, start the car with an iPad
Drank stains on my shirt is the new fad
Shit don't stink, underwear made of mink
Big Moe, purple soda, ain't never pink
Have you ever mixed a two-liter with the pint?
I could show you how to drank 'till you faint

[Hook x2]"Sippin, sippin on lean, sippin, sippin on bo'"

[Bun B]
Comin down grippin grain, diamonds up against the wood
Tops drop, blades chop, trunk is popped, I'm lookin good
Swangin down the boulevard, chunky deuce, the fifth is shinin
The queen is ridin shotgun and Finger's behind me
So never you mind me, I'm just hustling, grindin
My pockets are heavy and my diamonds are blindin
My pistols are loaded and cocked so know that I'm ready
I'll die for my family dog but I'll kill for my fair day
R.I.P. to my baby bro, UGK until
It ain't no stopping this movement, you lose on the real
Cause we keeping it trill, that's from ashes to dust
We got paper to make and fake nigga's asses to bust
If you down for your hood, and you bangin that Screw
Put your sets in the sky, cause this one is for you
Keep on keepin it true, fuck haters and again
Cause we don't play the game to say we play, we play to win

[Hook: Mistah F.A.B.] {X2}
Leanin to the side, you cain't speed through
Two miles per hour, so everybody sees you
Ridin by myself, with the pistol in the do'
"Sippin, sippin on lean, sippin, sippin on bo'"

[Mistah F.A.B.]
Candy on my big wheel, yeah man I'm still a kid
Twenty-six, rims same age as me, can you dig?
Ridin down the block, knockin pictures off your wall
Just showin off my grill made by Paul Wall
Alpine speakers in my grill on blast
Like my boys in Texas, hittin corner on them slabs
Seat laid back, you know how us pimps be
Keep your head up Bun B, rest in peace Pimp C
A mill' on mine rolled back to back and young millionaires we haven't scratched
Rhyme through the hood and habitat, candy paint look like some cabbage patch
Haters hot, they mad at that, Chamillionaire, how F.A.B. get that?
Two dimes in a car, how bad is that? King of the jungle, you an alley cat
Prince of the coast brought Cali back, just threw some D's on a Cadillac
Smoke so much, got cataracts, been rollin up for a matter of fact
F.A.B. get love where F.A.B. is at, from the Bay to the South where them slabs is at
Oakland down to Houston, only rollin with them savage cats

[Hook] {X2}

[Chamillionaire] {*Over Hook: Chamillitary mayne, yeah*}
It's gon' be, F-A-C, T to the Feds gon' mess with me
And F-A-B, when they see, mixtape money yes they pay me
Mugabe, Inspector G, bring 'em all cause they cain't get me
Ten vehicles parked in the yard, pick your choice, I'll get that key
Take that jet out to West, let's swang and get our swerve on
Hit that strip in my whip, gon' strip and let them sexy curves show
Vehicle sittin very low, pimp that caddy very slow
They like "Yeah, Chamillionaire, the realest I done heard holmes"

[Paul Wall]
I'm leanin to the side sideways, sittin crooked
My Jolly Rancher paint got all of the people lookin
I'm beatin down the block, givin the streets an ass whoopin
Peep the way a player move, take notes lil young-un
I'm movin slow mo', leanin off a potent fo'
Pistol in my lap, plus another one in the side do'
You know I'm just a young hustler all about my doe
Gettin cake and stackin up that paper, I need mo'

[Hook] {X2}

"Sippin, sippin on lean, sippin, sippin on bo'"[Paul Wall]
Boys talkin down
On the sidelines watchin wishin they was playin the game we playin
But it's all good though; Paul Wall
Brooke what up baby?

[Brooke Hogan] + (Paul)
What's it to you Paul Wall? Yeah (naw)
Now who's talkin? (naw)

[Paul Wall]
Okay, hey... what it do?
I hear the commentators on the side chatterboxin
Paul Wall and Brooke got all the paparazzi watchin
I hear 'em jaw-jappin, bumpin gums, chasin crumbs
We ain't concerned with the bums, we accumulatin funds
Flash the wrist, got the Johnny Dane watch froze
Five karat with the yellow stone in my earlobe
I'm squashin chatter when the light hit the pinky ring
Starched and clean, white cup full of lean
See me in that new Benz cause I'm also ballin
Or a old school slab with the fifth wheels fallin
We got 'em talkin, but really they ain't sayin too much
Just speculatin with they gossip
Truth is, they don't know about us

[Brooke Hogan] + (Paul)
I see your lips movin but I don't hear nothin (naw)
Everybody actin like they really know somethin 'bout us
(They don't know baby) But they don't know nothin 'bout us
(They don't know baby, they don't know about it)
I see your lips movin but I don't hear nothin (naw)
Everybody's actin like they really wanna know about us
(They don't know baby) But they don't know nothin 'bout us
(They don't know about you baby, talk to 'em Brooke)

[Brooke]
I'm just tryin to live, but you're all up in my grill
How's a girl to breathe with the media
Starin down my mouth, with a fo' inch lens
I just wanna hit the mall with some of my friends

[Paul Wall]
They talkin 'bout us so I guess we doin somethin right
Ballin in the mix with the camera lights shinin bright
They know we caked up, but they don't know how much we worth
Paper stacked to the ceilin all because we put in work

[Brooke Hogan] + (Paul)
Picture yourself in my shoes (uh) top story in the news
Everyday it's something new, everybody's watching you (f'real)
But they ain't seen nothing (naw) they ain't heard nothing (naw)
Everybody's just fronting, it's what they do

[Brooke Hogan]
I see your lips movin but I don't hear nothin (no!)
Everybody actin like they really know somethin 'bout us
(They don't know about us) But they don't know nothin 'bout us
(They don't know about us, nooooo)

[Brooke Hogan] + (Paul)
I see your lips movin but I don't hear nothin (naw)
Everybody's actin like they really wanna know about us
(They don't know baby) But they don't know nothin 'bout us
(They don't know about you baby)

[Brooke Hogan]
Stop stop stop! I'm not listening, you can save your breath
I don't wanna, hear the rumors people are spreading
Why, why, why do people go, out of their way
To try to bring us down, they don't know nothin 'bout us

[Brooke Hogan] + (Paul)
I see your lips movin but I don't hear nothin (naw)
Everybody actin like they really know somethin 'bout us
(They don't know baby) But they don't know nothin 'bout us
(They don't know baby, they don't know about it)
I see your lips movin but I don't hear nothin (naw)
Everybody's actin like they really wanna know about us
(They don't know baby) But they don't know nothin 'bout us
(They don't know about you baby, naw)

[Paul Wall]
They don't know baby, naw {*to fade*}[Hook: Paul Wall]
Money ain't a thang, paper ain't nothin'
When you're in a black Maybach on buttons
Cutting these bops, got dimes by the dozen
Higher than a kite and I'mma keep on puffin'
Money ain't a thang, paper ain't nothin'
When you're in a black Maybach on buttons
Cutting these bops, got dimes by the dozen
Higher than a satellite and I'mma keep on puffin'
Cause money ain't a thang

[Verse 1: Paul Wall]
In all black like a funeral
Hustle all night long to stack numeros
Serve 'em up something raw like a tuna roll
I'm in love with dead men but no Bruno bro
I'm talking presidents fresher than a peppermint
Grinding while you waiting on your workers comp settlement
My sentiments are get money and keep it trill
And I ain't stopping till the earth stays still
A wild one for real, my grind never yield
Paper chasing while you with your girl watching Dr. Phil
And fuck how you feel, what you think and you say
Get you wig split open like a fillet

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
Hoodies and checks, blow
I'm back from the death like The Crow
All black trucks, strapped up .44
I'm all that and what, act up there I go
And that's just a warning, black MurciÃ©lago
That's just the foreign, we likes to party
That's to the morning, I got 'em in deep like a coffin
The pink dolphins got 'em freaking, take caution
The Vs are awesome, we straight speeding all you see is exhaustion
I'm paranoid, detouring to the home
We don't say two words on the same phone
That's how the game go

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Paul Wall]
Time flies when you're dancing on the clouds
Grill got 'em seeing stars, you'll swear it was Tinseltown
I'm holding it down, profile is profound
And profit for seeing profits, post it ten [?] down
See I get it year round, I serve 'em like subpoenas
On the Melbow tippy toe strutting like ballerinas
Fresher then the cleaners, eight series beamers
If you jealous and hating then you can eat a whole penis
TV Johnny timepiece, mouthpiece reign
Educated dime giving Einstein brains
I'mma get mine snow, summer and rain
Now I'm clocking my gain, hold up mane

[Hook](*talking*)
Balling is a habit over here, at Paid In Full
Want you to know that, g'yeah

[Hook - 2x]
Balling is a habit like Jordan, Bird and Magic
My life is fantastic, immaculate, extravagant
Got a high rise and a bachelor pad, rims tumble like acrobats
A buck sixty where the dash is at, platinum card no maxing that

[50/50 Twin]
Balling is a habit baby
Chinchilla, makes my jackets baby
I don't wanna get cash, from rapping crazy
I'm gutter I grind, stop acting crazy
Capping on wax, ain't really me
Ten G's a day, that's a brilliant week
Big faces breeder thee
Caugh nine packs, I sneeze a ki
Roll through Panama, floss the Benz
Wipe my Timberland's, off with ten's
50/50, the Lil' Twin
Leave the rap game, with a flawless win
Take a flight, in a G-4-7
Spend the night, in a East Coast setting
I'm so hot dog, I need more relish
2004, watch B.C. fetish

[Hook - 2x]

[Paul Wall]
When my car, is changing speed
I'm like Tarzan, swanging through trees
It's so much, ice in my mouth
When I take a deep breath, I get brain freeze
Millionaires wanna hang with me
R&B girls keep singing to me
The FEDs think, I'm exchanging ki's
Everyday new car, I'm exchanging keys
Boys riding in 7-45's, that was cool last year
But I'm V-12 in a 7-60, Kenyon passing me beer
I step in the club cameras flashing, girls wanna take my pic
Which girls am I taking home, I can take my pick
50/50 in fur coats, so please no finger prints on his mink
I tip the bar tender more money, than I spend on the drinks
Lil' mama keep skipping and wink, she give me glances
I'mma make a move, on them sexual advances
And by the end of the night, I can garuntee I'mma be up in them panties
I ain't never slept in the same room, twice in my house
Frosty the Snowman can build a house, with the ice in my mouth
I got more diamonds than South Africa, flawless ice is immaculate
I'm flipping the game like a spatula, now these girls ex-boyfriends mad at us

[Hook]

[Chamillionaire]
No spending ends, in gentlemen's
Strip clubs, it's just for spinning rims
I want it now, I get it then
Cop it drop it, cop it again
Not him again, not Bennegan's
Treat a slut for what, not fin to spend
For bitter Gin, and dinner when
I can get up in, her little friend
Rewind, back to fact that you
Get attached, to the bachelor
Cause the fact, that I captured the
Green back, she unstrapping her
Bra strap, getting back in the
Jacuzzi, cause of my macking the
Water gun'll be splashing for
The girl that hops in, right after her
Riding mayn, in a Lac with the
T.V. screens, in the back of the
Seat, Ro got strack and uh
Strapped with him, and that's because
The same person, that's dapping you
Be the same, thinking bout jacking you
Stack, is what the girl asking for
My ad-libs, is gon laugh at her (ha-ha-ha)
Koopa got you Koopa will spot you, yeah right
All she gon see, is my tail lights
And choke on the smoke, from my tail pipe
Houton Texas, endacedar
Purple stuff, if that's lavendar
Major labels, that's not what I'm asking for
Hang up the phone, I'll get back with you

[Hook - 2x](Fire!)
(Hey!)

[Hook - Paul Wall]
I got that trunk cracked, windows tinted (hey)
Trunk cracked, windows tinted (hey)
Slowly rolled and I'm bangin screw (hey)
Slowly rolled and I'm bangin screw (uh huh)
Comin down so fly-y-y-y
Smokin leaf so high-h-h-h
Slowly rolled and I'm bangin screw
Slowly rolled and I'm bangin screw (cheah)

[Verse 1 - Paul Wall]
What it do, it's Paul to the Wall, trunk up tall, let the four screens fall
Spiders crawl, gon' turn up the dial and the heads all nod like a bobble head doll
Bendin corners up and down Wayside, from Greens Road to that Antoine Drive
Crew on the side playin NBA Live, I'm too cool for school, ridin on buckhide
Turnin heads when I'm on that Scott
Hit that French's for a quick pit stop
Boys in the mail talkin about they on top
Eight months later all them boys flop
Like it or not, I'm in the game and I'm showin up
Keke got that oil and we pourin up
Hit the club with Captain Jack and Big Steve representin my hood, I'm still throwin up
Big money in the game cause the bread grow
Candy old school drop top for the ho
Boys used to be sleepin on me but The Champ is here, I guarantee that they ass woke
Ridin on spokes, that's the elbow, still rockin in the ice white shell toe
This for that buzz and that Kelso and you already know

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Paul Wall]
Yeah, I'm still on that 59 but might see me on the 58 comin down
All over the town I like to get around, jammin my Fat Pat screwed up underground
Comin down in the lime green '88
While them boys on the sideline want to hate
Bumpin Kid Paul, fuckin up the state plate
I must admit my life's great
T. Ferris with me in the snow bunny Benz
Lookin through a Louie lens and we stackin up ends
Bros over hoes, yeah I'm talkin about friends
Got 'Freedom' on my arm for my dog Lil' Twin
Dubs on the rim that's TIS
Just like Pretty Todd I'm +G-Boy Fresh+
Got oil comin in and it's straight from the West
And the grill chrome mesh on the Cadillac crest
Head of the best, I ain't messin with the rest
Santa Claus sled that's pomegranate red
Sippin the taste, I take it straight to the head
And the Swishahouse is what I rep 'til I'm dead

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Paul Wall]
I'm tippin fo's and I'm sippin fo's and I'm flippin hoes with my partner clue
Posted up at that TSU or that Prairie View with my partner Lew
Hawk, boys get outlined in chalk, tryin to run up and jack my slab
This one here for my boy Lil' Ke, I'm throwin the deuce up and givin boys dab
Pourin the juice up and grippin that Ave, wavin hood so the bass showcase
Settin the trends, steady choppin up wind with a diamond ice grin, that paper I chase
Take a fade by that Bad Boy Shop, tip up slow, I'm screwed up and chopped
Listenin to some of that Robert Earl or them Choppaholics, maybe that Michael Watts
Choppin the block up, holdin a full cup, breakin a strut and now I'm on new swang
Grill and woman popped trunk full of bang, I'm third coast grade and I'm drippin stain
I'm hittin stank tryin to break that bread, slowed and throwed 'til the day I'm deceased
Leanin tough, I got a cup full of stuff with a starched crease and a Johnny Dang piece

[Hook]

(Hey!)
(Hey!)
(Hey!)
(Hey!)
(Hey!)
(Cheah!)I'm ballin baby {*"big ballin" - repeat and stutter*}
Gridiron on the beat
Big house, big car
Hoes everywhere, ice everywhere, money everywhere
I'm ballin man, I ain't braggin
I'm just tellin you what it is like, I'm ballin
Knahmtalkinbout? Whattup {?}
I see you on the beat mo' betta

[Paul Wall]
I'm comin down, candy paint, sprayed by that Eddie
12 coats of that clear lookin like some grape jelly
My paint's drippin wet, my slab is superb
Park the truck and catchin boppers down here in this dirty third
I hold it down for the block bleeders workin overtime
Not concerned at all with petty shit, I'm occupied on the grind
I keep my mind on breakin bread, makin chess moevs, thinkin ahead
I soaked up game at a early age, I'm built for this, I'mma seasoned vet
Swangers symbolize respect, cain't just anybody tip on Vogues
They'll catch you slippin in the turnin lane, and leave ya ass naked walkin home
Candy on chrome is how I drive, with screens fallin in the back of the ride
My music screwed and my drank is purple, go and take a sip I'd be obliged
I'm comin straight from the land of the fry, the city of syrup and the home of Screw
I'm on the block with my potnah Gooch, stashin cash in my Reebok shoe
What that do I can't complain, the candy gloss drippin off the frame
Ball in the mix I'm off the chain, it's goin down H-Town

[Hook 4X: Paul Wall]
I'm big ballin baby, yeahhh, and I'm spendin cheese
I'm on my grind all day makin money with ease

[Paul Wall]
I'm grippin on that woodgrain, I'm sippin on that good drank
I'm showin love to every side and every neighborhood mayne
I got them neon lights glowin, representin my block
I'm on that 59 South, ridin with my trunk popped
From that Homestead to that Spice Lane, I'm on Scott, in the turning lane
I'm headed straight to that Timmy Chan's, order up and let's get some wangs
New Hawk on that chan-nel, I'm on that dolly right
On the way to my gran-ty house, I'm navigated by bubble lights
I'm tatted by that Junior, I'm cut up by White Mike
Busted up by that Mr. Davis, sluggin me is a beautiful night
That chrome is quite atrocious, complimented by candy gloss
I'm tiptoein on fo' swangers, eighty-fo's like Randy Moss
Open mouth and show platinum grill, it's like a disco ball
I got expensive tastes, courtesy of expensive jaws
They see me comin grill and woman, truck bumpin
Knockin pictures off the wall is nuttin cause I'm a baller

[Hook]

[Paul Wall]
When the speakers start bumpin and that fifth relax
I make the trunk dance around like it's doin jumpin jacks
I'm ridin on them Spyders, them eighty-fo's tiptoein
And that trunk is exalted with them neon lights glowin
The candy paint's immaculate, drippin wet up off the fender
Beat the block up like a boxer, chop the street up like a blender
I got the flat screens fallin down from the ceiling
And the platinum mouthpiece with diamonds in the filling
I'm big ballin, grippin grain, breakin bread, I'm stackin change
Gettin money I'm havin thangs with two commas, I can't complain
Drippin candy paint, off the frame, switchin lanes
In the turning lane leavin stains, cause I'm a baller

[Hook][Intro: Trae - chopped & screwed]
Chyeah, 'knowmtalmbout?
You ainât shit if you ainât screwed up, fo' real

[Z-Ro] + (Trae) + {Both}
Houston, Texas, home of DJ Screw, we say knowâm saying and what it do?
(And if a nigga donât like it, tell them bitches I rep Texas, topless, in the slab I come thru)
Elbow and Vogues and expensive clothes, candy-paint car our cars, big booties on our hoes
(Got diamonds in our mouth, still represent the south, put the truck up bitch, Iâm swanging fourâs)
I sip codeine out the styrofoam, 27-10 is the kinda grind on
{I ainât ever love a bitch, so Iâm riding alone, prolly when them niggas ainât on the kind of shine Iâm on}
Big dully trucks with the big rims, and the Cadillac with the fifth wheel
(We from the hood and we keep steel, if you try to jack them youâre gonna get killed)
I donât wear my britches tight, I wear them loose
Active Athlete for all my footwear, homie I got too many shoes
{Iâm the man in my city, tell them niggas I wonât lose}
{Cross that path, and my nigga Hawk, we still gonâ chunk the deuce}

[Hook: Trae - chopped & screwed]
You can me in the hood in the city that I claim
Moving slow, like the music that I bang, screwed-screwed up!
Bitch Iâm from Texas, yeah, bitch Iâm from Texas
Bitch Iâm from Texas, yeah, bitch Iâm from Texas
Gla-glass underneath, beatinâ-beatin', my block
Pop-pop my trunk, chain-chain fulla rocks
Bitch Iâm from Texas, yeah, bitch Iâm from Texas
Bitch Iâm from Texas, yeah, bitch Iâm from Texas

[Paul Wall]
You can find me in h-o-u-s-t-o-n, ridin' in
Candy trim, on pokey rims, wit a ten and her friend
Trae the truth, ridinâ right behind, two cups full and Iâm on my grind
Talkinâ dine, respect my mind, I'll show you boys how Texas get dine
Rolex time, top lift back, on my nuts, cuz I got that sack
Papered up to the roof, it stacked, hoes wanna hate but it donât mean jack
Wheres thereâs money thatâs where Iâm at, that Texas grind, thatâs all I know
Banginâ screw and drankinâ Big Moe, basically get that dough, bro

[Slim Thug]
Northside, where the boss ride, e'ry day I got play outside (huh?)
Leavinâ them haters mouth wide, can't be denied when they see me slide
Through the hood like I live there, shit, I got a few cribs there
All my Gâs still chill there, we barbecuin' them ribs there (huh? What?)
Smoke blunts and sip punch like its lunch, every day we do it
Listeninâ to nothin but Texas music, perfect match for that good fluid
Find me in the hood, in the city I claim, everybody dine in H-town know me mayne
It ain't a choice, I canât change, I'mma rep the north like I gangbang (Thugga)

[Hook]

[Kirko Bangz]
Uhh, I gotta bad ass bitch, parked outside
Yella diamond my wrist, if itâs dark outside
Pull a lilâ bitch then I catch ghost, just a lilâ kid from the ghetto
Never had shit but I got a lilâ bit, when I got a couple hits under this belt
Throw a H up, nigga, I ainât tryna belch or nothinâ, ain't got a whole lotta money but I'm wealthy money
I sip a whole lottta drank but I'm healthy mami, daddy was cool, but he couldnât really tell me nothin'
Uhh~!... Everybody think a nigga lucked up
Young Kirko, he done blew up, from the H-town, nigga whatâs up?

[Bun B]
Iâm Port Author, Texas, letâs get that straight off the top
Thatâs where the hustlinâ and grindinâ and the hatinâ donât stop
From the westside to east, we out here duckinâ them cops
And coming dine, candy paint, on them motherfuckinâ chops
Itâs the land of the trill, thatâs where the whole thang came from
And it just a word, or where a rapper get his name from
Itâs a way of life, and we live to the fullest
For years, we represent it with blood sweat and bullets
Ho, Iâm from Texas!

[Hook][Intro]

[Verse 1]
It's Slim Thugga muthafucka, got a lot to sell
But snitches already got a lot to tell
So far as y'all know all I do is just rap
And give these streets something they can play in they trap (cheyah)
Last year I had to put my city back on the map
This year we goin hit em right back with a slap (that's right)
I had the whole wide world tippin' on 4's (fo's)
Sippin' on drank, using gland slow
Claiming they the boss I guess they like my style
Copyin what I do, mayne they like my child
I'm listening like damn mayne them boys wild
Thinking to myself, mayne them boys foul
Bitin' everything from my slang to my smile (damn)
Thought I was goin let it slide... hell naw!
If the shoe fit wear it, listen to it compare it
You niggas ain't my fam, how my style you inherit

[Hook]
I call all shots, all wins no losses (no losses)
Follow me, I'm the boss of all bosses
I'm the boss of all bosses [x4]
Ha, fuck what'cha heard, fuck what they talking
They follow me I'm the boss of all bosses
I'm the boss of all bosses [x4]

[Verse 2]
Ha
H-Town, trendsetta I'mma lead the way
The only rapper doing everything I say
Them other boys fiction (ha), grew up bein Christians (ha)
I'm a good dude, I just gotta alot addictions (that's right)
I love getting money you can see it in my face
It's like I'm bout to bust when I stuff my safe (cheyah)
I love getting pussy but I hate these hoes (I hate these hoes)
I'm bout to hit the block and -drop the top on 4's-
I know you probably tired of hearing about my cars (I know)
That's what'cha get for turning hood niggas to stars (that's what'cha get)
What the fuck you would do if you was me?
Never had shit now you rich as you can be (what)
Used to hit lick's selling bricks in the streets (ha)
Now I'm selling hits for ten times the fee (ha ha)
And stayin' free, I ain't seein' no jails
The boss of the south gon stay giving them hell (ha)

[Hook][Hook]
I'mma break 'em off real bad
I'mma show 'em pourin' up a duece and ridin' slab...

[Verse 1: Paul Wall]
Now I gotta work my woodgrain wheel
Poppin' trunks, poppin' pills, still poppin' seals
Higher than a hill with my mind on mill
Piece and chain swangin', bankroll, shiny grill
Baby I got million dollar dreams with my mind on cream
I'm in that mean green machine; clean, on 19s
Flatscreens in the headrest, swingin' like a swingset
Brandywine paint wet, comin' down, that's a bet
I'm in the lot chasin' broads like a lesbian
Full of that kush-flower, I'm breakin' off pedestrians
Higher than a streetlight, floatin' like a parachute
Buzzin' like a bumblebee, mustard-green Bentley coupe
Young gangsta mack game sharper than a thumbtack
Breakin' 'em off, makin' all the boppers attract
Then they watch me, I'm rocked up, fully loaded and sloppy
Tryna hit it and quit it and walk off like Big Papi
Break 'em off

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil' Keke]
Aye, aye
I pull up like this, untouchable white wrist
I'm hotter than warm piss, berry grape Sunkist
The truck gold mist 550 snow bunny
Bentley Continental with the mink floors dummy
Paul Wall money, that's expensive taste
And them friendly ass fools we send 'em to MySpace
I'mma break 'em off until the backbone broken
Stainless steel drop Phantom, leave the top open
Shit done hit the fan, better cover your nose
And the kush done start burnin', better cover your clothes
(that's right)
Concrete crumblin', glass shootin' lasers
Crawlin' and cuttin' up on 24 razors
I'mma show 'em how to make the slab look phenomenal
Chasin' paper in the mornin', call me Houston Chronicle
Hold on, then you buckle up the seat belt
SwishaHouse, Young Don, capital TF

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Paul Wall]
Already
I'm higher than a satellite, crawlin' like a baby
Maneuvering through the traffic like I'm Tracy McGrady
Still choppin' on them buttons, I'm struttin' and lookin' fresh
Switch hittin' like Berkman, this is ballin' at its best
In that Minute Maid dropper with retractable roof
Finer than wood, wavin' the hood, student loans on the tooth
The fifth wheel on the ground
And the trunk in the air
Paul Wall, baby I'm the definition of playa
My skills is so ill when workin' that wood wheel
Tippin' 4s like a waiter, beware of the oil spill
Widescreen mindframe, panoramic pimpin'
I'm sippin' on that Osama, baby, leanin' like I'm limpin'
In that two-seater feeder, it's me and a seÃ±orita
Three ounces up in the liter
And it's ten up in the heater
Mackin' a mamacita
Runnin' game like a cheetah
I'm knockin' 'em out the park similar to Derek Jeter
Break 'em off

[Hook]Fell in love with a Cadillac - 2X
Trunk turn flip, like a acrobat

[Hook - 2X]
Broke up with my foreign car, and fell in love with a Cadillac - 3X
Trunk turn flip, like a acrobat

[Trae]
I woke up, thinking foreign car
But the Cadillac, got a nigga sitting in a daze
24's hittin switches, sitting sideways
Trae flipping through the hood, like I'm running through a maze
Find me trunk up, with the top back
One deep in the front, two freaks in the back
Haters mad at me, cause I'm MVP stats
Better give me fifty feet, cause I'm good with the gat
Good with the track, like I'm good with the hands
15's banging, like I'm battle of the bands
New Benz like send, they run up out of grand
And the trunk read Trae, so they know that I'm the man
Me Paul Wall, in a slab out of Texas
In a Cadillac, had to get rid of the Lexus
Rather be gangsta, tipping on something
With something in the clip, that'll get rid of the plexing

[Boss]
I fell in love, with my Coupe DeVille
It's on a switch, it's the truth for real
Scraping the back down, these Southwest streets
Got a few teeth in the grill, loose for real
Big pumps, two to the front one to the back
One wheel in the air, gliding like that
Three O-7, rebuilt without chrome
Hundred spoke Daytons, with the two prones
Next week, I'm in some'ing from the Lowrider book
I'mma show these motherfuckers, how a lowrider look
Hit a switch on Boss, will get your lowrider took
In '98, I use to be the lowrider crook
Fleetwoods, El-Dogs Sedan DeVilles
When I ride, always equipped with handy steel
Cocked up on three, and got em standing still
I'm in the attick, wondering when I'm gon land and chill

[Hook - 2X]

[Juicy J]
I'm never staying focused, always smoking
Presidential kushing, always choking
Nigga I drank up, all your purple
If I find out, that shit be potent
Mayn I get high, fuck that shit
Your baby mama out here, sucking my dick
I'mma make her pay me, that child support
I'm a pimp out here, trying to make it rich
If you really wanna get high, let me know
I'll tell C.B., let you hit that blow
We can ride in the Cadillac, way in the fucking back
Hitting all the spots, just hogging that ho
Then take a lot of freaks, to the Hotel room
System on blast, you can hear that boom
Mayn I'mma pop bout, two three X
And drop my drawas, and take this chewing

[DJ Paul]
See in that M-Town, we snort that blow
Turn around mayn, and whip our hoes
Take me big gulp, full of that drank
Now I'm high, don't know what to think
First I had em beating fast, now I got em knocking slow
Sniff a lil' mo' of this sip a lil' mo' of that, even down the middle whoa
Closed up my foreign do's, opened up my American do's
'72 Sedan DeVille, 84's and 20 inch vogues
Chandillere, hanging from the top
Fish tank, lit up in the glass box
But I had to put, the toy fish in it
Cause the real ones died, from the kick box bitch

[Hook - 2X]

[Jay'Ton]
Jay'Ton, pull up in a Lac cocked up
22 inch chrome, bags popped up
Diamonds in our mouth, cash stocked up
Ice game six, so the game locked up
9-4 Fleetwood, headlights on
Fifth let back, but the trunk moved on
Flying through the hood, with the six 12's on
Seal in the groove, super kush to the dome
19 in the game, only love for my Lac
Never loving a dame, swang to the left
When I'm hulling the frame, trying to take mine
You'll be hugging a stain, like I'm hugging the lane
Screw tape still on, drank in my cup
Everytime, that I roam
Roach ass hoes, still calling my phone
Representing for the South, H-Town is my home

[Trae]
I'm a 24 inch black, Fleetwood glider
Tipping the block, they love the way the drop sit wider
Lord knows haters mad, when the left fly by ya
Call it what you want, but the Lac stay way liver
Boppers all on my dick, with the trunk up
Beating up the Boulevard, with the beat pumped up
Hit a switch on the remote, the front jump up
Run up on the slab, roam that'll get you lumped up
Hopping out looking like do's, got threw on backwards
Throwed wardrobe, by my bed son of a bastard
When it come to Cadillacs, Trae got that mastered
And the game that I got, way flyer than NASA
Me and Three 6, representing for the drank sippers
Iced out grills, and the wood grain grippers
84 swangs, and the late night tippers
Riding for the hood, Cadillac tight whippers

[Paul Wall]
I got that candy red, with extra gloss
Heads turn, when they see me floss
Scooped up Trae, on a sunny day
Holla at Jay'Ton, and my boy Lil' Boss
Trunk to stay popping, and hoes stay bopping
Cause the swangas poking, and the blades stay chopping
Beat the case, but the FEDs still watching
In the Fed-Ex truck, right down the street plotting
Dropped the top, if the sun on shine
Sipping on some potent, puffing on pine
Slow Loud And Bangin', in a candy slab line
Down here in H-Town, it go down
Old school Chevies, and throwback Lacs
Swangas and vogues, with a trunk that crack
This how it goes, down here in the 3rd Coast
Houston Texas, at the bottom of the map baby

[Hook - 2X][Hook: Lil Keke]
I chunk up the deuce for the south and the north
Boys talking down and boys wanna hate
I chunk up the deuce for the south and the north
Boys talking down, don't make me pull out the choppa
I chunk up the deuce for the south and the north
Boys talking down, I'll leave 'em on the streets dead
I chunk up the deuce for the south and the north
Boys talking down, I got them diamonds in my mouth

[Verse 1: Paul Wall]
Well it's that grain gripper from Houston, Tex
That barre sipper, that barre, no plex
I'm straight up outta that Swishahouse, where G. Dash write all the checks
So check the neck, check the wrist, I'm balla status from head to toe
My jewelry shop sell more grills than George Foreman, baby now you know
That ain't a igloo, that's my watch, and that ain't snow, baby that's my chain
That's not a ice tray, that's my teeth, and that's not a snow cone, that's my ring
That ain't Kool-Aid up in my cup, I stay sipping that purple oil
I stay flipping the slab on fours, cause I'm a hustler 'til I'm in the soil
My wrist game is one of a kind, Patek Philippe worth a 100K
My work schedule out on the block, it's mash all night and grind all day
No 401K for a hustler, just bleed the block and stack that paper
M.O.B. when it comes to hoes and a .40 cal when it comes to haters
We authentic playas not counterfeit, got a 600 Benz with a fog kit
Got hoes at the HK turning tricks, outrunning the track, trying to make me rich
I'm too legit to quit, stacking up that paper 'til I'm gone
So I'ma be working wood wheel and catching splinters
Riding twenty inches or better in chrome

[Hook: Lil Keke]

[Verse 2: Lil Keke]
Don Ke
Houston, Tex, got the streets burning, popping seals with them fours turning
Rookie boys, they still learning, losing cash, I'm still earning
Get my bread when I shake the fed, keep them dimes in and out my bed
Jump in the drop to convert the top and let 'em bop on candy red
Leather seats with that wood out, they don't know what my hood 'bout
Tryna take the young don's spot, I'm platinum balling and still hot
Haters off in my mix again, pimping broads plus pimping pens
Multiplying, I gotta win, keep that ice looking clear as gin
Out the roof still chunking deuce, riding slab and hopping juice
Diamond grill with plenty of skills, just pass the mic and I let it loose
Independent still chasing bucks, 22s on Porsche trucks
Model chicks with them big ol' butts, killer clans with them big ol' nuts
Hit the club with my game tight, hoes bopping my fame right
Did her thang the same night, boys talking, it's all hype
Cut the check when I run my mouth, rolling in green like I'm playing golf
Texas boys be going off, representing the north and south

[Hook: Lil Keke]

[Verse 3: Pimp C and Bun B]
I'm from Port Arthur, Texas, represent it 'til I'm dead
Pimping almost died in the 80s, boys was scared
Bitches was on crack, and the 'Lac wasn't rolling
But the game done been revived cause now the south side is holding
Pockets stay swollen, what do we do with all this cash?
Drive '84 Biarritz with TVs jumpin up out the dash
Pistol in the stash even though I'm on parole
Nigga try me with that fuck it, bitch I'll leave your body cold
From the land of grain, dripping paint, 84s and a chrome grill
This Texas baby, dirty south, P.A.T., you know we real
We pack the Ks, Desert Eags, ARs and them 38s
We serving nothing but Chyna Whyte, playa we don't sell that dirty weight
Big Bun Beeda, hold it down, rep the town to the fullest
Whether it be on the mic or in the streets busting them bullets
Don't put it with me, I won't pull it on you and leave you ventilated
UGK is back on the block and you marks is finna hate it

[Hook: Lil Keke](Intro, Paul Wall & [Juelz Santana])
Swisha House baby
[Juelz Santana]
Ya boy Paul Wall
[I mean, I know it's a lot of hater on yo side]
Yo I know they over there hatin on your side too
[Oh yea, but'chu know we don't give a fuck about them niggas, man]
Fuck 'em

(Hook, Paul Wall & [Juelz Santana])
We don't give a fuck about you
We tote big guns, front, we'll pop you
[We be]
[Creepin through ya hood]
[Creepin through ya hood]
[Mask low, mean mug, creepin through ya hood]

(Verse 1, Juelz Santana)
I'm down and I'm dirty with this
I'm down to get dirty, ya bitch
Aww man, aww damn
The pound is just hurtin my hip
Fuck with me
I'll show you how them pounds and them birdies get flipped
Play around clown, you'll get found in the dirtiest ditch (Ey!)
He like, yeah I don't give a fuck about who (bout who?)
I'm like, we don't give a fuck about'chu ('Bout you)
Hat low to the front
Lean back, smokin a blunt (Ey!)
See that button? Hit that, dope in the trunk
Nope, coke in the trunk
Nope, both in the trunk
That gun is on my hip too, I been hopin you stunt (Yup!)
You don't want my niggas creepin through ya hooood (Through ya hoood)
You don't want my niggas creepin through ya woooods (Through ya wooods)
You don't wanna see that pistol in ya face, homeboy
You don't want my niggas leavin wit'cha gooooods (Gooods)
So don't play like that (Don't)
Don't act like that (Don't)
If you ain't like that (You know)

(Hook)

(Verse 2, Paul Wall)
I got them windows tinted, five-percent
Presidential limo tint
I can see you, but'chu can't see me
Two-twenty-three with extended clip
Them fifty shots gon' set it off
So fire drill, bitch drop and roll
Gimme that watch, gimme that chain
Empty them pockets and pay the toll
I hang with killas out on parole
Catch ya cut, run and hide
Evacuate, murder-for-hire
Kinda like Omar from the wire
We'll chop ya up like garlic cloves
And cook ya ass, like Elmer the chef
Take ya last breath, put on ya vest
But I'm aimin at'cha head boy, not'cha chest
Now pack the iron, I'll start'cha dyin
Hit them legs and crease ya up
Then I hit the spot with a bad bitch
That'll slob a knob and piece me up
And when ya wake up, in the morning
To the sounds of them choppers roaring
I wear the heat, just like Alonso
We'll leave ya whole family in mourning
I'm in the hood like wig shops
I'm on the grind, on the block
Posted up like Yao Ming
In a low post, I'm on the box
We'll chop ya up like a Screw tape
And have ya hollerin like the Opera
But with my side-kick goin off
I ain't talkin about no T-Mobile partna

(Hook)[Hook x2: Kirko Bangz]
I hold my cup up, I let my top down
And everywhere I look they pourin' up now
Say shout out to them Texas niggas, Texas niggas
I do this shit for Texas, nigga

[Verse 1: Kirko Bangz]
Bitch, I hear ya talkin'
You about that shit, then take that off
Fake ass niggas gotta lay down
Reppin' H-Town, now a nigga can't play that off
Niggas came down to the city, stole from the city
Hoes from the city like "play that song"
These rap niggas know I'm the new nigga
But no nigga gotta put Kirko on
Bitches know I'm 'bout it, man
Love the way that I swang that chrome
I be all in her body man
Every bitch that I fuck, I own
Uh, while you be tryna marry the bitch
Ain't tryna burn, but this money I'm tryna bury quick

[Bridge: Kirko Bangz]
Ooh, I'm sippin' on that purple stuff
Ho, I ain't 'bout to pour you up
Ooh, I'm sippin' on that purple stuff
Nigga, I ain't 'bout to pour you up

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Z-Ro]
When I hold my cup up, it's just like lifting weights
Look like I'm chewin' instead of sippin' because this is an 8
I don't want no soda, homie, I'd rather sip it straight
I'm an OG out that screwed up clique
King of the Ghetto, this is my name
I be rollin' on swangers with candy black paint on 'em
If it rain, still ain't gon' get a stain on 'em
I'm from Texas, you can tell how I talk
I'm from Texas, you can tell how I walk
Six-piece wing dinner from Frenchy's
King of the ghetto, ain't never been friendly
Just put eleven more ounces in me
Whenever you see me, my cup ain't empty
So many fifteens, so many twelves, so many 6-5-9s
I'm bangin' so hard, everybody else bangin'
But I don't give a fuck if they park by mine
I've got a thunder trunk
I keep coughin' cause I smoke thunder skunk
I've got the lightning dick, I need thunder cunt
And I dare any one of y'all niggas to mess with Texas
Texas gon' fuck you up

[Hook: Kirko Bangz]

[Verse 3: Paul Wall]
First they steal your lighter, then they steal your style
Fat Pat is my idol, I've got twenty bands on my smile
Forgot to pay they homage, they just reuse and recycle
Man, they lie so much that they don't know the truth
But they'll swear to God on the Bible
I don't know where they do that at
But it damn sure ain't in Texas
Ridin' in the 'Lac down 45, I-10 is my exit
I do this shit for the city, swangin'
I've got wood grain in my Leffries
Pimp C is the greatest
Motherfucker, talkin' down is a death wish
Codeine is my fetish - pourin' up is a way of life
Legend stealer, Jerome Bettis
You punk sipper ain't drakin' it right
8 or all, that's a day in the life
Open trunk, and array of lights
They used to say this was local shit
Now everywhere drinkin' muddy Sprite
Pour up...

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Slim Thug]
I rep for Texas, nigga
You gon' respect us, nigga
We got ya sippin' out them white cups like Texas niggas
Got ya shinin' diamond grills like them Texas niggas
Rappers screwed up and chopped like them Texas niggas
You get the message, nigga? So chop some checks up with us
Them broads be tryna get us, cause they know we them niggas
She love my Texas swag, and how I keep it G
Let her roll in the slab, she wanna be seen with me
I tell her pay that fee, it's pimpin' with me, mane
Ask any bitch in Texas, ain't no sippin' with me, mane
Still drippin' candy stains, got that drink by the pint
Cause I'm a Texas nigga, what we do Kurt Cobain

[Hook][Intro](x2)
Girl, where ya' goin' (where ya' goin')

[Verse 1: Paul Wall]
Paul Wall, Two cups, hold up
I pull up on them thangy thangs, sitting crooked
They watch me like a Laker game, I caught ya' lookin'
Cup purple like the Laker gang, extra muddy
With a middle finger up in the air, up to everybody who judgin'
If you talkin' down then you need to kill that shit abruptly
Walk up in this motherfucker like, "Fuck you, double cut me,"
Listen bro, trust me, it's the dough that make them lust me
They'd rather be with me because your rusty jewelry is dusty
I'm too up in this Mountain Dew, leaning off the DJ Screw
Boppers yeah I keep a few, I'm fresher than the morning news
Prada shades, exclusive view, Italian shoes I gotta slew
If ya' think I ain't the shit, then bitch you must be sniffin' glue
Fuchsia is my favorite hue, and codeine is the cause (hold up)
I change my cars everyday, like I change my drawers
I swear to God I hate you haters like I hate the laws
Hot boxing with your broad, got kush smoke out my exhaust

[Hook](x2)
Girl, where ya' goin, who ya' came with, what your name is
I know you jockin', cause I'm famous, cause I'm famous
Keep the chrome on my waist bitch, ain't gon' say shit
Riding around in my spaceship, man I'm wasted

[Verse 2: Hopsin]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo, yo
Critics telling me I rap too foul
I throw them off like a gap-toothed smile
When I dropped raw, I dropped jaws
In 2013 and I'm coming in with a brand new sound
Who the hell got something to say?
How many fake motherfuckers am I crushing today?
I'm trying to handle my prey
Eat up or my stomach will ache
And brace when I let my steez rub in your face
Can we all just get along?
To me, I get a little violent
Niggas be wildin', talking a gang of shit when I ain't lookin'
But when I see them they stay silent
Why is the world filled with a whole bunch of morons?
I'm in the middle feeling trapped like I'm Zordon
I know it's a cold planet but fuck it I'm still chilling with my sandals and shorts on
Making a fortune, watching whores cum, fucking them raw make them get abortions
Here's a line of cocaine, you should snort some
I'm the new rapper brainwashing your son
I'm just trying to make everything more fun
See, I do this strictly out of boredom
So I guess I'm like every other rapper making some bullshit
Just so you can buy it and give me more funds
Fuck those niggas, I'm much more iller
Every couple of seconds my nuts grow bigger
When I get spotted by women they get the itching to hop on Twitter so they can upload pictures
I'm usually willing to give it up, go figure
I got a girl, so I just don't give a fuck
Hop into your car and blast it, for the bars of madness
Cuz I'm far from average
I'm famous bitch!

[Hook](x2)

[Verse 3: Yelawolf]
They done let that killer out the cage, give me the keys Forrest
Catfish Billy got a pump shotgun, shells full of that Norris Chuck
Cowboy boot-kick motherfuckers to the floor because I'm bored as fuck
Coors to crush, cans to crack, doors to rush, jam packed
Brother work hard, more to look than looking, they is lucky to know me
Buddy I'm an alcoholic, and a workaholic
I'm a work of art that you paint on a canvas
All savant with a Dupont bucket, full of mossy green
Dammit, camouflage on the beat
I done lost my team, I'm hard to manage
Let me put it to you simple, I own this fucking house
I'm a pioneer, look these are just my clones that are popping out
I must've been abducted when I was in Alabama
Me and swamp fox, I swear I saw it
Changing channels, looking for Dukes of Hazzard
Between Rap City and Dixie Flags
I don't know if I'm fishin', huntin' or puttin' tags on bass and bucks
Mountin' or roundin' the fuckin' masses, into a lake
So they can take a public bath in
Subjects that I intertwine the lines with such a stack
Get double bagged by MCs, haters they chuckle, laugh and choke
It's such a gas to me
I fill up my chevy with critic quotes so suck on that
Until is dope, I'm popping, it's bubble wrap, folks
It ain't been this ugly since that single that Bubba had, nope
Yeller!

[Hook](x2)[Chorus]
Daddy, daddy wasn't home, so momma raised me
And I'm still mommas baby
Daddy, daddy wasn't home, so momma raised me
And I'm still mommas baby

Daddy, daddy wasn't home, so momma raised me
And I'm still mommas baby
Daddy, daddy wasn't home, so momma raised me
And I'm still mommas baby

[Verse 1]
March 11, 1981
My momma gave birth to a hell raising heavenly son
And my daddy was a fool addicted to brown
So he wasn't ever around, but my momma held me down

When me and big sister had nothing to eat
My momma gave up her last trying to make ends meet
She was a school teacher, working to provide for her fam
Struggling in AA, to submit to gods plan

Them long twelve's steps of hardway are all on your own
No family, few friends, my momma was all alone
She did it for her children, struggling to make a living
And some how we still had food on thanksgiving

When I can barely talk momma taught me to pray
And right then I knew that we'd have a better life some day
She still give up her last just to see me smile
That's the definition of love for you child, I love my momma

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
My momma was my role model, I had no father figure
Just a bunch of pipe dreams of being richer
But as times got tougher my life just got rougher
It hurts so bad to see me watch my momma suffer

Its so hard to cope when you so dead broke
So momma used to make me memorize the song quotes
In the middle of a session momma gave god praise
I knew what it meant to struggle at such an early age

Remember them days she barely earned minimum wage
But made sure I had new cloths to start the seventh grade
She met my step father, and walked down the aisle
I praised he sent somebody that would make my momma smile

He raised me as his own, he taught me to be a man
Adopted me and anne, and gave momma a hand
I just love to see that beautiful smile on momma face
My momma could never be replaced, I love my momma

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
20 years of struggling, done came to a close
No more old, torn up, and hand me down cloths
She derserve the best, and never nothing less
No stress, give my momma that Gucci dress

The times were hard but we done made it out the rain
The storm was severe but we overcame the hurricane
Them rainy days seem to last so long
When them times got hard my momma told me be strong

My number 1 supporter ever since day one
And still till this day momma would die for her son
No more slumz, all them rainy days are done
No a days we taking trips to Disney world just for fun

I put you in a benz take you out that nova
Its been a long rough road, but that bumpy rides over
You raise me from a baby, my number 1 lady
And until the day im in my grave, ima stay mommas baby

[Chorus][Intro: Theophilus London]
Where the weather is warm

[Verse 1]
Moonlight move when a nigga dance
Peep a nigga steeze from a nigga stance
Had to leave home wasnât working out
Kiss moms for me if you get a chance
Walk the streets where I stay
Niggas give me daps and pounds they canât wait
In the moonlight you canât see my eyes
And when Iâm off the things I canât think
Man I been coasting the coast
Swear a young nigga done been through the most
Washing my mind out with dope
Shit real, but you know a nigga canât choke
When they recognize a real nigga still
Ride with me, down with me, say he a float
And all my real niggas sitting in the VIP
Shoving champagne through the next girl throat

[Hook: Theophilus London]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Letâs get high, and go dance on the moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
We could fly, and go straight to the moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Touch the sky, and go dance on the moon
Where the weather is warm and we forever live long

[Verse 2]
Lost in the moonlight, run through the moon like new
Cop lights, no lights, cause the bills they was over due
Now a skinny iggy nigga got fits from the runway
Taking trips to the side of the moon
I just take trips to define my peace
But I got a little feeling it might be in that tomb
I like my weed in the cheese, roll that that a little thick
Better watch your toke, you donât wanna choke
Better let that jack roll down your neck
Iâm on some popular shit, come look in my eyes and get a fix
We just go'n cruise hit the brews, lay back don't worry bout shit
It might get rowdy cause all the freaky models wanna party
All the freaky models in the lobby, it's so obvious that they lobbyist
Man it canât be realer, me and my niggas in the villa
She in that white dress it canât fit her
Sweet not bitter, drink like you got no liver
Hit it and she on the moon my nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Paul Wall]
Paul Wall, two cups, hold up, hold up
Iâm headed to the moon cause the world screwed up
Like the city I grew up so
Iâm pouring up a co-cup, 'bout to get tore up
Got a Xanax crushed up
If you steal my cup, it'll get you fucked up
Pull up to the moon with the trunk up
Gettin' sucked up with three blunts rolled up
Smoke all three at the same time: call that triple OG
In the triple D I'm full when Iâm on E, you donât know nothing 'bout me
Back wood feel with a Compton tree
Getting full of that oil, I got gas and grease
Three lines poured up in the big East
Baptized a blunt but I ainât no priest
Peach Ciroc with a Norco, piece of hash and my trippy sticks
OG wax on a bone with a skillet, me and Paskel been doing that shit
Def' rocking link, what you know about this
Baby bass came through with the kush assist
Percocet ten and a soma twist on the moon
Getting higher than a bitch and Iâm doing my dance

[Hook]I'll be, I'll be, I'll be dancin' on your grave
Dancin' on your grave
Dancin' on your grave
Dancin', dancin' on your grave
I'll be
Get Busy, Get Busy
Dancin' on your grave
Dancin' on your grave
Dancin', dancin', dancin' on your grave

[Hook]:
These streets are watchin'
Got my eye on you
And what you do
These streets are watchin'
Got my eye on you
And what you do

[Verse One] [Apathy]:
I'm like Sam from Cheers
Chillin' at your funeral
(Dancin' on your grave)
Get it? So beautiful
Kiss my ass motherfucker I'm a heathen
I'm the reason why you're seizurin' and speakin' like a demon
In the coldest darkest region of the planet I be sleepin'
Like a beast in hibernation, I'm just waitin' for a reason
To awaken in the season where it's freezin' I be feastin'
On the flesh of lesser beings, force feeding meat to vegan

[Xzibit]:
Underestimation been one of my best barometers
Animation, you amateurs, drinkin' straight out the bottle
I don't haggle or hassle, you fuckin' assholes asked for it
Merciless, miraculous, immaculate, fast forward
Get it how you think you got it
Did it while you thought about it
Tucked it when you shoulda shot it
That ain't how you speak about it
You actin' like you catchin' bodies with that chalk around 'em
My satisfaction comes from not givin' a fuck about 'em

[Hook]:
These streets are watchin'
Got my eye on you
And what you do
These streets are watchin'
Got my eye on you
And what you do

[Verse Two] [Paul Wall]:
Aye, I'm strapped up like a parachute
They watchin' yo ass, hurry up and give me the loot
For the underdog, waitin' for the levee breech
Chop 'em like an onion, in a bathtub full of bleach
I'll do the south side and body rock your tombstone
Drown your dog in a pool and make a bong with his bones
You little clones are sweeter than a cinnamon scone
You should have never fucked with the kid from Acre's Home

[Ryu]:
On your grave I'm gonna Fred Astaire
Dancin' on your face, yeah
I'mma fuck your kids up
I should run a daycare
Teach 'em how to slang H
How to beat a rape case
The champagne's less filling then the fame but it tastes great
That's why I spill it on these bitches when I hit the stage
No disrespect it's just how my gang celebrates
Dues paid, Paid Dues, Ace Of Spade, Grey Goose
AK's and cocaine, peace dudes, hang loose

[Hook]:
These streets are watchin'
Got my eye on you
And what you do

Get Busy, Get Busy
I'll be dancin' on your grave
Dancin' on your grave
Dancin' on your grave
Dancin', dancin' on your grave
I'll be
Dancin' on your grave
Dancin' on your grave
Dancin', dancin', dancin'

[Verse Three] [Murs]:
I'll be dancin' on your grave
Moonwalkin' on your mausoleum
Got the crypt keeper, Crip walkin', man you gotta see him
I'm outta here, man your boy's so major
These haters have heat, but I'm fuckin' with these lasers
Act out a favor now your face is a crater
Real hood nigga dressin' like a pro skater
I'm O.G., I got money to burn
I'm yellin' G.B.C. and hit my dougie on your urn

[Scoop DeVille]:
Scoop De, V.I. double L. E
To the rap game I'm like Arthur Fonzarelli
Blacked out lights through the club like Belly
Real recognize real, you ain't gotta tell me
You smell me?
Huffle puff a chronic sack
What the fuck is wrong with that?
Be afraid, take it to your grave bitch, promise that
Dancin' on that shit
I be campin' on your trip
Keep a phantom on my neck
And a mansion on my wrist

[Hook]:
These streets are watchin'
Got my eye on you
And what you do
These streets are watchin'
Got my eye on you
And what you do

I'll be dancin' on your grave
Dancin' on your grave
Dancin' on your grave
Dancin', dancin' on your grave
I'll be dancin' on your grave
Dancin' on your grave
Dancin' on your grave
Dancin', dancin', dancin' on your grave(*talking*)
Ay what's up mayn, this your boy Big Tuck
Ad-Tuck-Hitler, Hurricane Tuck and Paul Wall
This what I want my dope boys to do
I know we got a lot of dope boys out there
Everybody know  we got money down here
We gon put the new shit up, and we gon jump in a old school 'Lac
And we gon dip on these hoes, g'eah-g'eah

[Big Tuck: Verse 1]
I swear, I'm the freshest nigga moving
GT roof down, cruisin' (cruisin')
Gucci loc's on, peeping bitches choosing
Tipsy on the dance floor, grooving
Seeing niggas hating, cause I'm shining
Got money in my pockets, I don't mind em (I'm rich nigga)
Yeah nigga, peep this watch
Peep this chain, my shine don't stop
I'm dope man fresh
The J's on point, heavy crease the Guess
The chain on the chest, hoes obsessed
They finally get to meet the Big Tuck in the flesh
She's watching, I know that I got her
Three karat studs in the ear, she know I'm a rider
And it's just like that
The Benz in the garage, I'm bout to jump in the 'Lac

[Hook - 2x]
Dipping in the Lac, with the do's rose up
Ho-hoes froze up, cause the do's rose up
Ho-ho-hopping out the Lac, and the chain froze up
Rose gold up, rose-rose gold up

[Paul Wall: Verse 2]
Pull up to the club, bout twelve cars deep
All dripping candy paint, with some glassy ass feet
I keep the trunk waving, and that dro stay blazing
With the nine tucked tightly, at them haters misbehaving
I'm a hard hitter like Greg Blue, setting trends and squashing noise
Pulling up in some candy toys, strutting the parking lot with poise
You see them karats on my wrist, and all around my neck
With nothing less than flawless diamonds mayne, what you expect
I got a lot of charms, I got a lot of chains
I got a lot of grills, and nan one of em look the same
Swang and bang in my candy car, boppers wanna know who we are
Street veterans and mic wreckers, we certified young ghetto stars
Popping bottles that's just for fun, popping trunk that's in my blood
Candy paint might cause a flood, please don't spill my cup of mud
You know we stay balling, cause we keep grinding for that bread
Swishahouse it's Paul Wall, and I'm G-Boy fresh until I'm dead

[Hook - 2x]

[Big Tuck: Verse 3]
I'm dope man fresh, dope man fresh
Chain on the chest stayin' dope man fresh
Dope man fresh, dope man fresh
Hopping out the Lac, staying dope man fresh - 2x
I'm a certified, wood gripper
I'm a old school, candy paint Lac flipper
Got the bang on, and the screens lit
Got the dro going, satellite kit
What you know, about the mink guts
And the motor, that'll drag race a school bus
Just, got the paint job touched up
On the freeway, riding with them do's up

[Hook - 2x][Verse 1: Young Dolph]
All my bitches say I'm dirty than a motherfucker
Pineapple fanta in this dirty than a motherfucker
Shot out to Bun I'm ridin' dirty than a motherfucker
A half a million, all 20's it got blood on it
Presidential day-day and it's flooded homie
I just left the car loft and spend another check
Hunnid band profit and I didn't break sweat
I dosed of on that drank and almost had another wreck
My lil bitch stay mad at me cause I don't get no rest
I'm always out here chasin' money so she get no sex
I'm in that drop top, bangin' screw and burnin' rubber nigga
I'm down in Houston on that boss shit like Thugga, nigga
Got everythang on my own so I'm like fuck a nigga
World wide, cross the county stackin' ruffles nigga

[Hook: Young Dolph]
She a good girl but lil' mama bad though
She got a small waist but a fat ass though
Thirty points I had to take came in the glass though
Still boomin' pills and strong out the back door

[Verse 2: Slim Thug]
I got G's out of Memphis that'll kill for me
And everywhere I go the hood still love me
Cause Thugga is a hustler, Thugga is a boss
Thugga made it trough them droughts on that nasty North
Me and Paul still tippin', sippin' with that Dolph
Got 'em ridin', red fo's, breakin' boys off
Kottonmouth kush blunts back to back
Nowadays ridin' Rovers but still keep a clean  'Lac
Thank god everyday, I ain't gotta sell packs
I ain't tryna see the FED's I like my bed where it's at
Countin' these stacks like I'm gettin' platinum plaques
Livin' that boss life, breakin' hoes like the mack

[Hook: Young Dolph]
She a good girl but lil mama bad though
She got a small waist but a fat ass though
Thirty points I had to take came in the glass though
Still boomin' pills and strong out the back door

[Verse 3: Paul Wall]
No nuts mean no money
No money you must be a dummy
No dummy that's a fifth wheel
It's only March but this my fifth grill
Packin' the steel, chasin' the mill
Workin' the wheel, yeah I'm the man
Make me a ticket and I fuck it all off
[?] kush cause I can
Chain with the chunk a 70 grand
Trunk with the bang it sound like a band
Whenever I pass it's turnt like a vent
[?] girl I know she a fan



[Hook: Young Dolph]
She a good girl but lil' mama bad though
She got a small waist but a fat ass though
Thirty points I had to take came in the glass though
Still boomin' pills and strong out the back door[Intro: Lil' Keke]
Big terrible Texas
It's where legends are born
I'm Lil' Keke The Don
Original Screwed Up Click
It's a dedication to DJ Screw
Fat Pat, Big Mello, Big Steve
Feel it?

[Hook: Lil Keke]
Draped up and dripped out, know what I'm talking about (x4)

[Verse 1: Lil' Keke]
I'm draped up and dripped out, the truth has just slipped out
84's, red doors, candy apple flip-flop
Got them boppers dripped out cause my drop tip top
Purple cup, screw us up, that's what keep the streets hot
Don P, Bun B, please free Pimp C
Hydro, Super Flow, know these boys feeling me
Come to Houston, Texas and see swangaz and 'lacs
And don't forget to tell the people that the legends are back
Yeah

[Verse 2: Slim Thug]
It's Slim Thug showing H-Town love
Used to hit the club on dubs, acting bad on scrubs
Mad spokes and leather, 24's or better
Boys say they riding candy but my load is wetter
The roads for competitors when they see the two letters
They'll never ever ever ever ever get on my level
Me and Bun together caked up with clout
Staying draped up and dripped out, know what I'm talking about?

[Verse 3: Chamillionaire]
The city is back, just look at the map
Thought we wouldn't get in the game
I'm sticking my dick up in the game and bustin' in that like a train
I'm hitting that mayne
Look at this grain I'm grippin', I'm fixing to swang
My bumper doing the body rock and my trunk is doing the crane
Now who in the hell was able to tell the world it wasn't my bang
I turn up the beat and I'm cracking the street
The city we started to train
The world is looking like Texas mayne
Just watch how they pick up the slang
Just show 'em your grill
And pick up some drank and watch how they do the same
Hold up mayne

[Verse 4: Paul Wall]
What it do baby? It's Paul Wall
Players rise while haters fall
Got fo's crawling in the 54
On the service road, I'm obeying the laws
I stay shining like headlights
And I stay crawling like head lice
Just like a boy but I play the dice
Them twos and threes ain't nuttin' nice
Them threes and fours I'mma roll fo' sho
Fo's and vogues, we call 'em swang
My partner Bun B bring the pain
Wanna know what I rep? Just check the chain
In the hood is where I hang, on South Lee, that 5-9
He dippin' oil, he drippin' candy
From P-A to H-Town, it goes down

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Mike Jones]
Ice Age, Mike Jones
I stay draped up, dripped out, drop the top when I'm flipping out
Candy low on 84 (how you know they fo's?) They poking out
Ice Age and Rap-A-Lot, pimping hoes in the parking lot
Diamonds shining in my grill, you can see 'em if its dark or not
When I'm out in the limelight
I make sure I shine bright
I'm in the drop with the Glock cocked
You know I keep that iron tight
I'm getting brain from a tight dame
On North Maine in the turning lane
I'm young and rich talking a lot of shit
I guess its because I'm having thangs

[Verse 6: Aztek]
I'm still draped up and dripped out, know what I'm talking bout
Fighting over parking spots, bustin' in the parking lot
Tu sabes, vatos, ves no fakos, parse
Te mato sin ningun contrato vamos
Now put your blocks up, now put your sets up
Fuck that nigga over there cause I think he said something
Have to take 'em with a clip out with the click out
Don't give a shit bout
'Till he gets out, free Pimp C, we draped up and dripped out

[Verse 7: Lil' Flip]
I told Bun when you need a verse, just holla
You know how we do it, you ain't gotta spend no dollars
I'm puffin dro, bangin' screw, and riding fo's
Middle fingers in the air, you know how it goes
Stash spot with weight in it, Candy paint with flakes in it
Trunk got the bass in it, One liter with eights in it
Swisha sweet with haze in it, you know I'm blowed
Four row diamond chain, you know I'm pro
Johnny got me right huh? 80 carats, bright huh?
Hit the button, pop the trunk, watch the neon light jump
I'mma keep folding bread 'till Pimp hold his head
We miss you DJ Screw, man I hate you dead

[Verse 8: Z-Ro]
Down to ride red but I'mma ride blue
In the turning lane looking just like Screw
300 Crissy, don't think they doors
Everybody know Z-Ro's flow is ferocious
I keep a Robert Davis in the deck
Might be deep 22 drank in the whip
You can keep the sherm but you can pass the cup
My Cadillac rolling on glass and wood
Would I knock a jacka down when his ass get up?
Hell naw, this is playa from the chest to the nut
Screw was here he said I would come up
Now the radio requesting my stuff
Gotta keep a Smith-n-Wesson in buss
Cause the better life keep me stressing enough
Is this rap for real, is it a blessing or what?
Screw I hope I see you when they wet me up

[Verse 9: Bun B]
This is H-Town, Texas, tell me how does it look?
Taking over the rap kitchen and we ready to cook
You can hear us whipping the beakers coming out of the speakers
Chef-ing up some fresh hard for you out of town geekers
We got 3rd Ward, 4th Ward, and Southside G's
Plus Southwest and Bloody Nickels rollin' 83's
It's Houston, Texas motherfucker, you know the name
We'll see you in February for the All-Star Game

[Hook]
