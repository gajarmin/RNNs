Get my drink on, and my smoke on
Then go home with, something to poke on
Loc it's on for the two-triple-oh
Coming real, it's the next episode

[Outro: Nate Dogg]

Hold up hey
For my niggas who be acting too bold

Hope you ready for the next episode
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Smoke weed every day[Intro]
You're back now at the jack-off hour
This is DJ Eaazy Dick
On W-Balls
Right now something new by Snoop Doggy Dogg
And this one goes out to the ladies from all the guys
A big bow wow wow
Cause we gonna make it a little misty here tonight
This is DJ Eazy Dick
On the station that slaps you across your fat ass
With a fat dick

[Verse 1: Nate Dogg]
When I met you last night, baby
Before you opened up your gap
I had respect for you lady
But now I take it all back
Cause you gave me all your pussy
And you even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise baby, I'll give you a call
Next time I'm feeling kinda horny
You can come on over
And I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck that day baby
Just lay back and open your mouth
Cause I have never met a girl
That I love in the whole wide world

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
Well if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch I'd always be broke
I'd never have no motherfucking endo to smoke
I gets loc'ed and loony
Bitch you can't do me
Do we look like BBD, you hoochie groupie
I have no love for hoes
That's something that I learned in tha Pound
So how the fuck am I supposed
To pay this ho just to lay this ho
I know the pussy's mine
I'mma fuck a couple more times
And then I'm through with it
There's nothing else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
Cause she ain't nothing but a bitch to me
And y'all know that bitches ain't shit to me
I gives a fuck
Why don't y'all pay attention
Approach her with a different proposition
I'm Kurupt ho
You'll never be my only one, trick ass bitch

[Hook]
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Guess who back in the motherfucking house
With a fat dick for your motherfucking mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Cause when bitches get scandalous and pull a voodoo
What you gon do
You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that ho
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowing damn well I'm too caught up with my grip
Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga named Snoop
Doggy, I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see it ain't no fun
If my homies can't get a taste of it
Cause you know I don't love em

[Verse 4: Warren G]
Hey now you know
Inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready and four to hit the switches
In my Chevy, '64 -- red to be exact
With bitches on my side and bitches on my back
So back up, bitch, because I'm struggling
So get on your knees and then start juggling
These motherfucking nuts in your mouth
It's me, Warren G the nigga with the clout[Verse 1: Hittman]
Xxplosive
West coast shit
My nigger-ish ways attract girls that used to turn they back
Causing me to yank they arm impose like I would do them harm
Now I'm saying thank you cause they tell me
My shit's the bomb
Xxplosive
For my niggas drinking Cognac
Smoking weed, always pack
More than one firearm, chrome rims, riding on
Chronic in your system, let me know my shit's the bomb
Xxplosive

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
West Coast shit nigga
Overdosage imperial pistols ferocious
Fuck a bitch don't tease bitch, strip tease bitch
Eat a bowl of these bitch gobble the dick
Hoes forgot to eat a dick can shut the fuck up
Gobble and swallow a nut up
Shut up and get my cash
Backhanded, pimp-slapped backwards and left stranded
Just pop ya collar, pimp convention, hoes for a dollar
Six-Deuce in a plush, six-deuce impala
Pimping hoes from Texas to Guatemala
Bitch niggas pay for hoes, just to lay with hoes
Relax one night, and pay to stay with hoes
Captain 'Save-'em-all-day', well save this dick
Bitch nigga, you more of a bitch than a bitch
You ain't into hitting pussy or hitting the switch
You into hitting bitches all for the grip
You punk bitch

[Verse 3: Nate Dogg]
All my real doggs still kick it with me
All my down hoes still tricking with me
All the true gangstas know
Nate ain't never love no ho
All the hoodrats still shake it for me
All my true fans still checking for me
All the real smokers know
Nate ain't passing nothing but dro indeed
Real trees, chronic leaves, no seeds
When I met you last night baby
Before I blew your mind
I thought we had a chance, lady
No more, now that I'm sober you ain't that fine
Don't wanna treat you wrong
Don't wanna lead you on
Here baby hit the bong
While the West Coast rolls along
While we, still making gangsta hits
You'll be, still jocking gangsta dicks
Damn girl you think you're slick?
Somebody better get this bitch, this bitch

[Verse 4: Six-Two]
I got these freaky hoes
Clapping they hands, stomping they feet
Every now and then they put they mouth on me
Nowadays a G like me can't even call it
A 23-year-old pussy fiend and freakaholic
Pimping bitches on the regular, I put that on the G
A hustler and a player, nowadays it pays to be
Let me drop some shit about this bitch I used to know
She gave your boy the head and said don't let nobody know
A bonafide pro, I had to grab the ho
She got freaky in your '64, I skeeted in her throat
Been knowing the ho for four days, pimping repays
And I bet you didn't know that she go both ways
She ate her best friend, I left them hoes at the mote'
They be beeping me and shit, but we don't kick it no mo'
Them hot hoes is fiending, they on the nuts
But bitch, I'm out your pussy when I nut, fo' real[Intro: Joy]
My daddy said drown, nigga

[Hook: Tyler, The Creator]
(Pow, pow, pow!) Coming in for yours
Niggas got them choppers and they knocking at your door
The sirens getting louder when the bodies hit the floor
Why you look confused? Mothafucka, this is war

[Interlude: Tyler, The Creator]
Yeah, nigga, uh, yeah, nigga
Yeah, nigga, uh, yeah, nigga, uh, yeah, nigga

[Verse 1: Schoolboy Q]
As this G shit begin, put this product placement on your chin
The realest nigga breathing, y'all pretend
Real Crippy since I hopped off the swing
With my strap, that's my peace offering (Yo, yeah, uh, yeah)
Five shots get rung out, five bodies falling
Come put your lights out, I spark your apartment
Deadline my clothing, don't fuck with Pink Dolphin
Strap on his hairline, his forehead gets softened
Send extras through his chest bones, shit, he don't need that coffin
Most niggas would've run away, but me I'm out here walking
Bucket hat with my shades on, my wardrobe look awesome
Now nah, I ain't on no dolphin, fuck rhyming, I'm Cripping
Niggas rap about what I'm living, all this false claiming, I'm marring
Doing drive-bys I ain't steering, white funerals, I ain't tearin'
Fuck your bitch in front of your children
Steal your whip side of my building, yeah
Put my dick and nuts in her mouth, bust in her hair
I'm very rare, got my trigger on top of my underwear
Bitch, I'm everywhere and over there
You die here, let off a pair (YAWK, YAWK)

[Hook] + [Interlude]

[Verse 2: Schoolboy Q]
House full of kilos, sold pound to zeros
Cocaine my hero, you in Figg Side, getting Deeboed
Always asking for the burner like, young niggas still free load
Heart big as my ego, don't fly around my signal
I'll rearrange your dental, Crippy my house shoes
Blue rag disciples, murder I'm liable, you get the Eiffel
Aim out the eyeball, I'm getting violent, I got the strike once
Won't get the strike twice, you niggas half price
Which means you half off, I'm going Adolf
I'm smoking bath salt, two sherm sticks, burn this, ooh
Knock-knock through the condo's, Schoolboy from the five deuce
But Hoover respect to you unranked, don't fuck around, get that chin banged
Groovelining, Crip walk the whole mile
Blue Belts, still my pants down, Chuck Taylors, Cortezes, hush puppies
My Glock, yeah, fuck buddy, make money, take money
Earn crack money, drug money, bail money
Heard they got life for me, but how they got life for me
When they took that from me, since I had my nose runny
I was out past sunny, had the strap by my tummy
You can go and ask mommy, grab a body bag, homie, yeah

[Hook] + [Interlude]

[Bridge: Schoolboy Q]
Bust my gun all by myself
Rock cocaine all by myself
Poured propane all on myself
Go so hard might harm myself

[Interlude: Schoolboy Q]
Yeah, nigga, uh, yeah, nigga
Yeah, nigga, yeah, nigga

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
Yeah, it's Kurupt young mothafucking Gotti
Still rolling in a 6, I don't fuck with the Bugatti
Come up in this mothafucka looking for a bitch
Probably sucked on my dick then you kissed her on the lips
The integral, South Central sentinel
Get roped and choked, poetical tentacles stretch
Get roped and choked and rope-a-doped
Extra overdose of the oki-doke
Get a nigga smoked, I ain't no joke
Tired of this bullshit and everything y'all talk about
They walked 'em in, I walked 'em out
They talked 'em in, I chalked 'em out
Now cock back that Oxy (Pow-pow, pow-pow)
Walk inside, pistols popping, top is popping off
Pop a tab in this neighborhood, rolling 60 bars
Ghetto tribalist, squeezing pussy like octopuses
Show me where the money at, show me where the kush is
Next time you see me I'll probably be in the bushes
This is the reasons why I won't be fucking with pussies like you
Me, Tyler, and Schoolboy Q, we told them

[Hook][Verse 1: Dat Nigga Daz]
You find an MC like me who's strong
Leaving motherfuckers aborted with no verbal support
And when I command the microphone I get deadly as Khan though
With a bear and a snake and a panda, I'm all those
Who can withstand, the more power I gain
And make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck your brain
Imagine and keep on wishing upon a star
Finally realizing who the fuck we are
When I penetrate, it's been withstanding, faded
Would it be the greatest MC of all time
When I created rhyme for the simple fact
When I attack, I crush your pride
My intention to ride, every time all night
I'm faced with the scars beyond this one bar
For me to put down my guard, I'm faced with it, I'mma ride
Breaking in gas with the '68 all day
In-and-out with my pay, I'm soon to count the bodies

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
So mandatory, my elevation
My lyrics like orientation
So you can be more familiar with the nigga you facing
We must be patient, nothing better than communication
Known to damage and highly flammable like gas stations
Sorry I left that ass waiting
No more procrastination, give up to fate and get that ass shaking
I'm busting, and making motherfuckers panic
Don't take your life for granted
Put that ass in the dirt
You swear the bitch was planted
My lyrics motivate the planet
It's similar to Rhythm Nation
But thugged out forgive me, Janet
Who's in control, I'm activating your souls
You know, the way the games get controlled
Yo, two years ago a friend of mine
Told me Alize and Cristal blows your mind
Bear witness to the dopest fucking rhyme I wrote
Taking off my coat, clearing my throat

[Hook: Method Man]
I got my mind made up, come on
Get into, get into
Let it ride, tonight's the night

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
Well I comes through with two packs of the bomb prophylacks for protection
So my fucking sac won't collapse
Cause nowadays, shit's evading the x-rays
Sending young motherfuckers to an early grave
I wonder if my terrifying tactics of torturing MC's
Shows my heart's as cold as the tundra
Electrifying like thunder, I'm just too much
Rough and raw with that motherfucking poisonous touch
I'm a MC with lyrics that's the fuckin' bom-bay
You got ten steps before instant death like Bai Mei
My rhymes, I leave a mark on your mind
As the deadly vibes spread through your head like Sand Palm
There's no escape, nah, I ain't blastin'
I use my mental to assassinate assassin's for those askin'
Opposed to laughin', raw maniacal villain
Laughter enhances the chances of the killin'
Why is that? Cause smiling faces deceive
You best believe: to MCs, I'm the deadliest disease
My thoughts rip your throat and make it hard to breathe
Your whole camp's under siege, and I'm Jason Voorhees
In the heat of the night is when I defeat and ignite mics
My verbal snipe your vocabs on site
I'm out the cut, uncut and raw with no clause for all
So all my rhymes hit and split the bricks on the wall
You already have an idea about the superior sphere
The greater rhyme creator on both sides of the Equator
I rock from here to there, to Philly and back
To LA on the spot where I rock and bust like straps
As your views get overshadowed when you come in contact
Beware: set and prepare to enter verbal combat

[Verse 4: Method Man]
Fuck you losers, while you fake jacks, I makes maneuvers
Like Hitler, sticking up Jews with German Lugers
The Mr. Meth-Tical from Staten Isle
Will be back after this message, don't touch the dial
Rarely do you see an MC out for justice
Got my gun powder and my musket, blaow
Melons get swellings, I paint mental pictures like Magellan
Half of my Clan's repeat felons
Niggas best protect they joints for nine-nickel
Man, I stay on point like icicles
Now who wanna test Tical, then touch Tical
All up in your motherfucking mouth
Headbanger boogie
Catch me on tour with Al Doogie
Method Man rolled too tight, you can't pull me
Better take one and pass, or that's that ass
Your vital statistics are low and falling fast
Johnny Blaze out to get loot like Johnny Cash
Play a game of Russian Roulette and have a blast

[Verse 5: Redman]
Lyrical gats spitting the criminal tactics
Non-believers get my dick and genitals backwards
Let's face it, there's no replacement
Taste this madd underground basement shit I'm laced with
Avalanche on your whole camp when I'm spliffted
Funk Doctor who, Spock, bitch, don't get it twisted
I got connects like Federal Express
To get the fresh package of bless the dogs can't fetch
Got the clear spot from the rear block
To bust 'til every nigga here drop, men I fear not
Hold your nose and blow out 'til your ears pop
Since your crew suit you to shift, now you claim that your gears locked
Whiff this underground cannabis
I'm dangerous like John the Bomb Analyst
Flip MC's like ki's
My degrees freeze consecutively like EPMD LPs
Lick off a shot and hit your fam by mistake
So I erase the whole front row at the wake
I planned my escape in case Jake wann' snake bust it
I'm the one pushing the hearse in the first place
Confidence for you shaky-ass folks
Pump for Rockafella for the day he got smoked
Choke off this antidote, got you ope
Get roast by my lyrical Billy Dee .45 Colt
And I'm out for 9-nickel

*in the background*

She just want a real nigga that'll get that
Won't you let a Dogghouse nigga hit that
After after hours, little mama with that
Her skin so silky
Body  from a movie like she plaster on a silk screen
You sit back, posted like a poster
Look into the left and see your body's all mocha
Molly and coke I ain't a loca, I seen her, she loves hyenas
Especially hyenas with money like Lee Iacocca with an attitude
She just wanna have fun and I can give her what she want
I can make her pay for that
She just wanna have fun and I can give her what she want
I should make her pay for that

[Hook]

All these niggas and all these hoes in here
Somebody here gon' fuck

[Verse 1: Hittman]
Talking that, walking that, spitting at hoes
Smoking this, drinking that, gittin` at hoes
Fuck this I'm hitting that I'm hitting em both
Have one riding dick, one licking my toes
When I'm loving these hoes there ain't no love involved
No hugs, no kisses
Bear rugs, bare britches
Rare bitches like them hoes in them Blacktail pictures
Bitch jumped off my dick
Is that Dre over there

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Yeah, I just took some Ecstasy
Ain't no telling what the side effects could be
All these fine bitches equal sex to me
Plus I got this bad bitch laying next to me
No doubt, sit back on the couch
Pants down, rubber on, set to turn that ass out
Laid the bitch out, then I put it in her mouth
Pulled out, nutted on a towel and passed out

[Kurupt]
Come on let's get high, high
Let's get high, high
Come on let's get high, high
Let's get high, all my ladies
Let's get high, high
High, high
Let's get high, high

I make the four hop
Pull up at the spot
Weed by the barrels in my G'd up apparel
Stomping in the party
Kurupt, Young Gotti
I'm fucking something in this bitch
Hit 'em with some gangsta shit
Put something in your mouth bitch real tasty
I'm looking real saucy in my gangsta-ass Staceys
Hit the party, ease up, Kurupt with an ounce an'
Got all the hoes in this motherfucker bouncing
Down to

YO WHATTUP SCRAM JONES
Mel-Man what's cracking
Whassup wit all these ol' punk ass hoes in here

[Ms. Roq]
Nigga what, I'm a hustling bitch

Niggas bout the sex and which bitch to hit next
While I'm kicking my game and collecting them checks
Got all y'all niggas vexed to fuck this triple-X rated ho
You say you ain't eat it, you ate it though
Roq don't stop, can't be dropping no drawers
To the niggas how you figure got you shitting in yours
Yeah, little dicks always running they mouth
While a bitch is better off to masturbate and be out
All you bitches up in here know what I'm talkin about
Get the loot, get the ice
Fuck the wife, no doubt
Trying to live lavish
Marry a big dick and stay carried
Holla back at them niggas that hollered at me
Pop the Cris'

And have all y'all niggas limp when I twist my shit
Yeah, bitch ass niggas[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Bitch you can have a link; you can have a sus

Stepping out on them in these Now or Later gators
Yea I got 31 flavors
Stepping out on them in these Now or Later gators
Yea I got 31 flavors
Stepping out on them in these Now or Later gators

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg (& Kurupt)]
Me and Kurupt with my pound to the floor
Got a whole lot of gas but I don't know which way to go
I'm trying to find a white bitch a little snow bunny
Cause the word on the streets is they like to give a nigga money
(Me and big snoop nothing but some players
Looking at the bitch except she thinking 'bout the paper
Tryna get cracking, actress with the action
I'ma tell you with the words nigga what's happenin')
The police is on my dick cuz they all up on my face
Put some yola on a nigga then they run up in my place
Got that thang in the trunk, 3 cases in a month
I don't give a fuck; Kurupt let me get that blunt
(Cause we just tryna get it; the money and the game
Stepping in this motherfucker, talent tucker, undercover, bang
And then bustin' on these undercover bustas
Just to G up in the game, rollin on them thangs)

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg (& Kurupt)]
I got gators on my feet; khakis on my leg
Braids in my hair, super dome, super head
Said she gotta lick with it, wanted me to get with it
[?] is how we do it, moving real slick with it
(Yea I heard she the best at it; chew it up like spinach
Chew it up 'till she finish; man this bitch is not a gimmick
She's a pro, super ho, she got that super throat)
Living on your own, jibbin' on the phone
Forgivin' when you're wrong
Yea, but that's a whole 'nother conversation
Listen to me spit it to you with this meditation
(Yo, let's get this money bitch
I got the now or later gators on gangsta shit
Just a little bit, listen to this shit
Just a little bit of game spittin' to this bitch)

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg (& Kurupt)]
See you walking on the blue carpet music playing loud
King of the west coast Mr. Big Bow Wow
Ice cream sammich with the grab bag saggin'
Cap illar, I'ma steeler, got the gold rag flaggin'
(I got 31 flavors
3 of my bitches was exclusively used to be neighbors
'Till I threw that game on they table
Now they do whatever for me if they're able)
My little homie told me when he was 20 years old
I'm in love with a bitch, I told him fuck that ho
See I'm his role model with happy dog bottle
Puttin' paint where it ain't, break a bitch; you think I can't?
(I'm just hard in the paint, I'ma do what you can't
Pimpin make a bitch faint; I'ma circle then straight
Get the gat, get the tape nigga, 9, 38
I'ma circle then straight, got bitches out of state)

[Hook: Snoop Dogg][Crooked I]
Yo Iceman, watch how I come in this bitch off note
And bang for my team
If Mozart a genius, I’m the same fucking thing
Compare me the Pavarotti, I just can’t fucking sing
If life is a fight I’mma aim duck and swing
I don’t have to write ’cause these lyrics came from a dream
Ssut ssut COB blame the regime
It's like green screen
The way we changed up the scene
Chain with the cross on it
Lamb shank with the cabernet sauce on it
And act a beat with the boss on it, slaughter
All upon it it’s the God of
The west coast water
I can’t walk on it y’all want it
Nah, that’s a reason and die swallowing math equations
Tryin' to eat my piece of the pie
See I set my goal, so extremely high
I can’t see 'em from my first class seat in the sky
And before my plane departed
I walk in security they say a chain retarded
Are you a famous artist, no
But fuck yeah my name regarded
As an underground beast I’m just trying to change the target
Meet Ras Kass & Kurupt this a holiday
Niggas better move like pedestrians right away
I give you the blue print to thug life
Like I’m reciting Pac and Jay
The modern day Marvin Gaye
’Cause my pops wanna pop me
I would drop him before he drop me
Didn’t raise me and before cops can knock me
I would throw the Glock away when they stop me
And tell 'em my name is Scott free
Oh, I’m from the wicked west
Do I have a limit yes ,my limit is limitless
Fuck a cabby I packy
I blast from the back seat of his taxi
Then pass it to Ras Kass

[Ras Kass]
Fat pole in a slimy track
Grown up folk with a shiny gat
For more ex pills than tiny had
Sat where my crime is set
Never been a whiny rat
Stegosaurus rap reptilian with a spiny back
My East side bitch got hit with a shiny bat
In the wheelchair but her vagina ain’t handicaped
Uh, her vagina ain’t handicapped
Mensa member, big dick, good lookin' nigga, Annie rap
What you think all the guns is for
I’m going on tour in Mordor
With an elf queen for more whores
Throw us a Mexican drug warlord before poor
The skull of Abe Lincoln, seven years and four score
Want more call Crooked I, you could be Chinese
With the side ways face you’re not Crooked I
Cali don’t give a fuck gotta get through us
Lost lyricist trust now I pass to Kurupt

[Kurupt]
Heaven’s got a gape in hole the souls are mischief, mischievous souls
Hell’s frozen over pola I arose
Corrosion erosion temples are stealing stone
Crumble to the tone of the voice of vigilance
Violence in a judge,by the black a gap clap smoked then vaporized
Berserk a hydra, Cerberus
Wrap the titans connected to bend in both sides
Simultaneously at the same time he is eye
Double jeopardy, Gemini
Walk on the red carpet and turned it blue
Stand like a statue mind yourself
Reverse the camera lights and blind yourself
I’m the unseen sentinel sentinel
Oh, sent to your dough step to make buildings fall
I don’t wear ice my nigga I’m cold already and diamonds can’t freeze my wrist
I’m froze already, the future was already been wrote and cold already
The coded exposed we wrote and code already
Its the end of the end and beginning to begin
When it ends it all and it starts over again nigga
Heaven’s got a gapin' hole the souls are mischief
Escaped the road on the road to redemption Arctic
And art the archangel when hence means
Soaking these rodent rappers
Drenching in the instinct firing golf to body
Send in, in an instinct god he ate off the body
Send in every into 'em ,Hitler
Bitter bitter turn them to cat litter
Infrastructure are crumbled, infra-red spitter
Got 'em like an eye grass crooked eye cash bringing these niggas
Corruption world wide
Money ain’t a thing. bitches ain't shit
And neither are you nigga eat a fat dick
Hoes give me money niggas get shot
Every day in LA every way and every night
Every night, Every night
West coast murder[Intro]
You're back now at the jack-off hour
This is DJ Eaazy Dick
On W-Balls
Right now something new by Snoop Doggy Dogg
And this one goes out to the ladies from all the guys
A big bow wow wow
Cause we gonna make it a little misty here tonight
This is DJ Eazy Dick
On the station that slaps you across your fat ass
With a fat dick

[Verse 1: Nate Dogg]
When I met you last night, baby
Before you opened up your gap
I had respect for you lady
But now I take it all back
Cause you gave me all your pussy
And you even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise baby, I'll give you a call
Next time I'm feeling kinda horny
You can come on over
And I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck that day baby
Just lay back and open your mouth
Cause I have never met a girl
That I love in the whole wide world

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
Well if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch I'd always be broke
I'd never have no motherfucking endo to smoke
I gets loc'ed and loony
Bitch you can't do me
Do we look like BBD, you hoochie groupie
I have no love for hoes
That's something that I learned in tha Pound
So how the fuck am I supposed
To pay this ho just to lay this ho
I know the pussy's mine
I'mma fuck a couple more times
And then I'm through with it
There's nothing else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
Cause she ain't nothing but a bitch to me
And y'all know that bitches ain't shit to me
I gives a fuck
Why don't y'all pay attention
Approach her with a different proposition
I'm Kurupt ho
You'll never be my only one, trick ass bitch

[Hook]
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Guess who back in the motherfucking house
With a fat dick for your motherfucking mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Cause when bitches get scandalous and pull a voodoo
What you gon do
You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that ho
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowing damn well I'm too caught up with my grip
Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga named Snoop
Doggy, I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see it ain't no fun
If my homies can't get a taste of it
Cause you know I don't love em

[Verse 4: Warren G]
Hey now you know
Inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready and four to hit the switches
In my Chevy, '64 -- red to be exact
With bitches on my side and bitches on my back
So back up, bitch, because I'm struggling
So get on your knees and then start juggling
These motherfucking nuts in your mouth
It's me, Warren G the nigga with the cloutBOOK 1

100 miles and runnin'
Always into something
Yelling fuck the police
Like I’m straight up out of Compton
Real niggas don’t die
Appetite for destruction
Just a nigga with an attitude
Always into something

[Verse 1: Kurupt]
Stampede  on stomp, mash smash out
Cashing and taking motherfucking cash out
Hit double time switches pushing glass house
See the bitch like the garbage, take the trash out
[?] dear mama , here I come, Osama
[?] Big Snoop, [?]
Casey with the suit cases filled with llamas
In the car banging like a house party
Blowing out the speakers with the L.A. Leakers
Get fat burgers just to get a meal
And if a nigga trip I'mma shoot to kill
Ice cubes in my drank, I kill at will
Wish a nigga would cause a nigga will
Jump off with the sickle cell nickels?
Spray off  always into something dumpin', looking for a nigga
Now I got 'em

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]

[Verse 2: Stalley]
Still got impalas on eights, coupe riding with case
Smoke a blunt with Kurupt, lettin' the chevy move bass
Got the two on the waist, Jordan eights on the pedal
Ridin' down the  [?], showin' love to the ghetto
Niggas thought i was west cause I'm on the [?] with nigga
On the town front 'em swap meet with the Compton Crips
I get love out there from the hills to the strip
But I'm a mid-west nigga, don't mistake that ish
I'm authentic to my pearly whites, never bite and shit
So all that heckling and loose talk, get tightened quick
I'm from the bloodline of hustlers, bow tie and pricks
Gentleman services, million dollar fence
Rottweilers and pits, loud bops on the corner
Every nigga did juvie before they get the diploma
Stay runnin' from cops cause they now they pop on us
Most of mothers are single and most of fathers are stoners
And we coming from nothing, so we

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
Ridin round, round we go , I get around
Tryna make a dollar outta a dime right now
The illest youngin'  outta LA in a minute
Working down the 4, come home, I give it the business
If I give a fuck about a chick I be broke
Kurupt in the studio off them  moon rocks we smoke
Cops pull me over, they want my license revoked
I pull up in that Bimmer, give the young niggas hope
California weather, I swear it's so amazing
In my own city it feel like a vacation
Real west side, nigga, and I hate waiting
All we know is hustling,  gettin to the paper
They show me love every time I come around
I'm always into something, need to slow it down
I'm gettin' older now, man, I'm really growing now
Man in my city like the mayor how I roll around

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign][Intro]
Smoke sumthin'
Yeah nigga
Kurupt Young Gotti
Cypress Hill
Westcoast
From bouncing and banging
Throw them hands up high
And blast to the sky
Blast on everything you see
Cos we don't give a fuck
And blast to the sky

This is more than warfare this is Armageddon
Where the thoughts and intellect get threatened
Where the hostile become hostages
Wrapped and packed like sausages
My vocals soothe the air like voices and throat lozengers
Tucked in cottages, wondering where the cabbages
Lavishes, sold to the worst of savages
Fabulous, ilaverious, praises amazes
Stuns and sparks, throats like arcs
Lights the dark, brainwaves conveys
So I know what u thinking
You show what u thinking
Add up the currents and volts
Erase everything u thought u thought u thought
Busters look just like me
Mistake the launch quakes and get bust by me
Push on nigga or get pushed over
Subtle soldiers, sculptures, nigga we vultures
Super ninjas hitting muthafuckas like supernovas
Swift hands, little nigga with super shoulders
I'ma Supersoak one of u set back niggas
So for the game's sake nigga GET BACK NIGGAZ
Or get launched off on niggas
What you say Muggs? Man we don't love yall bitchesKurupt:
Check it out
Here's a penny for your thoughts, a nicklebag of bliss
An M-16 with eighteen clips
I'm all set to bust, treacherous
Illustrious, homie don't question us

Just ask yourself the question
How many hoes can I fuck in one night?
Just ask yourself the question, nigga
How many niggas can I blast on sight?

I'm ferocious, and you knows this nigga
Bitches wear skirts, shake ass and bump
I pop pistols, that's all I do
I pop one at him and pop two at you
I'm illusive, I'mma Glock it
Pistol popping activist with the key to the bucket
I rip your pockets of the side of your pants
You glare to the side and you glance, I'm in my (???)
How the fuck you make it this far?
No matter where you at, or who you are
People treat me like Kareem Abdul Jabbar
I hear ooh's and aah's when I jumps in my car
Just from last night you can tell
That I'm addicted to the fast life
Shouts out to my homeboys Mad and Quell
You go on and fuck Misty, while I fuck Michelle

Chorus:
Just ask yourself the question
How many hoes can I fuck in one night?
Just ask yourself the question
How many niggas can I blast on sight?
Just ask yourself the question
Is it cool to ride, or is it cool to fuck?
Just ask yourself the question
I don't know why these motherfuckers wanna fuck with us

What you wanna do, penetrate me?
Bump my crib? Bust and fuck my bitch, nigga?
I never thought a nigga would trip
Off a little piece of ass that he know he could get
Any day (any day) and any time (any time)
You'se a vegetarian (what?), I like beef, turkey and pork
Fish and chips, chips and dip
Fuck it, hand me my knife and my fork
I'm not too picky nigga, Kurupt young Gotti
A.K.A. Low Ricky nigga (what up momma?)
Substantialar, tyrannosaurus, gigantic titanic tarantula
On a creep homie, wake up
Don't sleep homie, supposed to know it
Look, I'm hazardous to health, nigga, bitch, nigga
Don't ask me shit 'till you ask yourself

Chorus (Dre)

Dre:
What the fuck is up? Man life's a bitch
You gotta put your pistol to the sky
Kill a million motherfuckers and get high in order to be cool
Man, you'se a motherfucking fool (speak to these niggas)
I thought the same way, back in the days
Young, with a lack on daily things
Never thought too much, homie, never trip
I got drunk as fuck, the homies blaze sticks
Look out for them niggas out to get you
So (???) forgetting to tank your pistol with you (your pistol nigga)
Niggas get swallowed in the game
I cock and bust hollows to peer, duck and frame
Yo nigga, that shit sounds like I did it
Don't blaze the (???) without the (???)
Niggas look like they're doped up like tired bitches
With the eyes wide gone you spit the hard boom
Wiping shit the fuck out like typhoons
With the little homeboys, T-bone and cartoons
Motherfucker don't ask me for shit
Fuck everything you believe in, little bitch

Chorus

Kurupt:

Okay let's say, you can do it your way
I'mma do it my way
Project to borough, today to tomorrow
Escapade to parade, expressway to highway
The freeway to tristate, 101045
Turn to 95, this side ride
Saturday's always the best of me
Cuz the whole day ain't nothin but rest to me
I got ladies hittin me cuz they just wanna chill
Perfect requirements in a safe environment
Like what's that poppin at the top of the hill
Where it's always poppin like hits and villes

The party's jumpin, I feel so high
Dogg Pound Gangstaz, we at it again
Party's poppin, from beginnin to end

(Verse 3-Kurupt)
Sunday nights and it ain't no fights
The homie just added up at the Dogg House

Like a dream with a bottle and everything's fine
And Nate he started blowin on the mic
And Butch he started blowin on the mic
And G he started blowin on the mic
Dogg Pound Gangstaz all day and all night

(Chorus X1-Fingazz)

Party's poppin, from beginnin to endYeah, gimme some gangsta shit curr
Some of that hood shit
Coming up
How that sound ?

I've been doing this shit since day one
Yeah nigga, day one, day one yeah

Let me, let me tell you what your worth is
Wake up in the mornin with a purpose
Only you can make me happy, surface
East side long beach baby, the turf shit
The place where I lurked at
13 on the scene getting bent back
With a whole lotta snake venom
Used to steal annihilators out the highway center
Up early getting shit started
Back flippin', trippin', tippin', crippin' cold hearted
Way before I got high man
Both double up 15s from the pie man
Heat out the motherfucking frying pan
Little kids love Snoop, fuck IronMan
I'm a vet on the set I ain't lyin man
Let me show you how fly I am
Play in the school, lay in the pool
And I stay in the cool
Young loc I ain't playin with fools
Reset, repeat
Unlock and recock
The heat and it gets so fast
Spend yo cash
It will get in yo ass
Now the question is this for now
Are you really in love with that bitch yo?
Another man's trash is another man's treasure
What's your pleasure?
Looking at you straight from a falcon eye
On my balcony, asking how can I?

How can I love somebody else
When I can't love myself enough to know
Bad 4 me, a lot of G's start snitchin'
Bad 4 me, Fuckin with you hoodrat bitches
Bad 4 me
All that you had 4 me, was all bad 4 me

Curr I used to run with struck out gon' away
Cold things is he called me on the phone today
Told me he was up for release
Its been about a dub since cuz seen the streets
Yeah loc, shit don' change
Long Beach don' flipped crazy durange
Everybody sellin' out, word of mouth, the OG's tellin' now
I drove there the other day
To chop some game with my big homie Donald Ray
Its sort of hard for me to run away
Step out my car no gun today, underlay
I press my luck, if I get stuck, well then thats whats up

How can I love somebody else
When I can't love myself enough to know
Bad 4 me, a lot of G's start snitchin'
Bad 4 me, Fuckin with you hoodrat bitches
Bad 4 me
All that you had 4 me, was all bad 4 me

The true definition of that mixtape

How can I love somebody else
When I can't love myself enough to know
Bad 4 me, a lot of G's start snitchin'
Bad 4 me, Fuckin with you hoodrat bitches
Bad 4 me
All that you had 4 me, was all bad 4 me

Somebody pass that piff, grow it up

[Hook : Game & (Tha Dogg Pound)]
(You got them funny ass colors on, take it off)
If you in the club with ice on, we takin' off
(I thought you was a gangsta nigga, you better shake it off)
(What?)
(Sh-Sh-Shake it off, or get banged on)

[Verse 1 : The Game, (Daz) & "Kurupt"]
Gettin' my bang on, red strings on
Luis Vuitton kicks, Luis Vuitton frames on
Luis Vuitton belt holding the fo'-five
You know who I am bitch, I'm Mr. Westside
(This West West or nothin' - get your pistols, get your flag)
(Gangstas we love to sag, we cock it back and blast)
(Like booyaka-booyaka, we lay the party down)
(G-G-Game, Dogg Pound)
Everybody get down
"Look nigga... I nurture and breed"
"I ain't never gave a fuck about a bitches needs"
"And bitch niggas try to invade our town"
"I'mma lay 'em down, spray the 'K and get out"
Say goodbye to the '6-4, hello to the '6-trey
He ain't never seen hydraulics, look at his bitch face
Up, down - now watch my shit scrape
Daz call Snoop, I'mma Crip Walk to get Dre
And Blood Bounce back, heat on the track
Dribble rock like Wade and bounce like Shaq
Throw a O in the pot and watch it bounce right back
Like that (like that?) like that

[Hook]

[Verse 2 : The Game, (Daz) & "Kurupt"]
(We street connected, respected, I gets pathetic)
(When I did it I must've meant it, so nigga go and rep it)
(Lil' homies around her constantly on smash mode)
(Lil' niggas with pistols that blowin' out your asshole)
(Bang how we give it, the culture that we live in)
(Fresh out the hospital or fresh out the prison)
(Real niggas for life, the roots of the G tree
N.W.A., Dr. D-R-E)
We not S-T-A-R's, we don't put stars in our shoes
Bitch we put the whole car on the shoes
You don't wanna see my car on the news
I'll "Set It Off" like Queen Latifah, red beam on the nina
"Bang out, chipping in traffic, dipping the classic"
"Dipping to classics, whooping that ass"
"It's hood niggas ready to get it, your bitch can get it"
"Cause I know she'll suck a dick in less than a minute"
"Cuz, I'mma have to show him where the house at"
"Two milli Macs, semi-automatic situational attack"
"In the back with a sack, Cadillac all black"
"Like this and like that"
"Bang, broken like glass and plastic"
"Bang out on him with the mask and plastic"
"We got access to massive plastiques"
"Purchased last week, D.P.G.C"
"Bang"

[Hook]

[Verse 3 : The Game & (Kurupt)]
Here come them outta town niggas, what up Blood?
(What up cuz? They don't even know what 2Pac first album was)
Should I tell 'em Blood? (Nah, fuck 'em loc)
Me and Kurupt three-wheelin' on the hundred spokes
(Dash, brake, bounce and scrape)
Run up on the '6-4, see the AK's
(Bang) like Eazy, (Bang) like Dre
(Bang) like Snoop, (Bang) in L.A
(Bang) like Crips and Bloods
From now on, wear a Bathing Ape hoodie get stripped in the club
Like a bitch in the club, watch him strip in the club
You like ice creams? Get a banana split in the club
No jewelry, you can't wear shit in the club
And that go for every nigga and bitch in the club
So you better take it off 'fore you get in the club
Game and Dogg Pound along side sittin' on dubs
Remember that

Carolina Bird Dog
You niggas is lucky

Motherfuckers hot for the moment
But when the moment's over
And the roller coaster you been coasting on
Comes to a halt and the conductor pull the handle on ya'
You ain't got shit to kick up the paper
What it cost
And he waving his hand for ya', telling y'all to come off
You ain't got no more tickets and everything closed
You look down in my hand and I'm holding the Row
And you know in your soul
I'm a loner, I don't fuck with y'all
Never have, never will
Nigga I don't fuck with y'all
Them ain't my homeboys
I just spit on their tracks
I sent the call for em'
And they ain't call back
I guess they got caught up in what the hood call a big head
Get the nigga that did shit for y'all for no bread
Next time ya' see me out
Ain't a need in acting scared
Just close your mouth and turn your head
Before I predict that I'm a

Hop, skip, and a jump
Away from the pen
Been there done that
My niggas miss me in there
If a nigga out here fuck up I'm gonna tear in his ass
This nigga here is short a couple cards in the deck

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
I'm so awesome, I perform when I walk
I'm a monster
No ??? I gotta be responsible for
I hit hard and plus I'm armed with firearms
So alert the security, tell em to get prepared for it
Holy moses, jeeper creeper, this nigga throwed off
I done dropped all of my marbles in the floor of my car
Ready to brawl so give me some church hall
And turn up my vocals dog
And let me kick this track in the balls
Put me in this car before you take insurance off it
And I'm gonna drive this bitch until I blow the doors off it
And while you're at it, run in there, smash on em'
Turn over table, kick him in his asshole
Take the paper, grip him up and stick a lighter to him
Stay there and watch all of em' burn
Tired of talking to em'

[Hook] 2x

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
You ain't never did what you say you did
I seen so many different changes in the way you live
But I ain't tripping
You know I keep it straight O.G
And everything you think you done that you think I don't see
I don't fuck with these bustas
I don't fuck with these bustas
Let me explain myself
Let me restrain myself
Let me reflame myself
Nigga, black Chevrolet on all gold D's
Just too motherfucking original ??
It's me, and the army's in a Cutlass Supreme
Dipping through the streets

On the way to ?????

If the bitch don't, tell her bounce like a bunny
I don't give a fuck bout what that bitch talking
She ain't got the cash till that bitch get to walking
I eat, sleep, shit, think about them dollars
Pop a pill, pop a nigga, pop my collar
I'm poppin' like a Tic Tac - bitch you better get back
Funny looking bitch, who been fucking? Sinbad?
I did that; do it all, go big never small
Got a crib with a closet, you would think you at the mall
And her mouth like halls in her jaws like wisdom teeth
You hear the beat; I bet you they gone bang this in the Middle East
I been a freak - 9th grade I was fuckin' in the bathroom
I was fuckin' at school like my house didn't have rooms
My best friend is named Benjamin Frank
So bitch better have my cake, FO' HUNNID
Haha, tatted up, nigga...

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
Yeah, I'm so high...
Man this bitch better have my money
This bitch so smart, she nothing but a dummy
Bitch better have my mula
Fuckin' round with a real nigga and his shooter
Little dust bag bitch! Make a nigga rich
Shut the fuck up and jump on this dick
Nothin' but a motherfuckin' skank
Fuck what you talkin' bout and fuck what you think
I need money, I need it real fast
I need it real bad like white girls need ass
Baby you can help me, break this dub
20 motherfuckin' racks up up in the club (club, club, club)
Club, up-up in the front
That's why I sent a bitch to get at each one
Triple top rank, treat her like a bank
I don't give a fuck what the bitch thinkin'; bitch I'm just sayin'

[Outro]
Bitch better have my money (BITCH~!) {*4X*}(Chorus X2-Butch Cassidy)
A bitch ain't nothin to me
Now let me tell you cuz I'm quick to put them ho's on the street
Make 'em bow down on they knees and do whatever
Cuz I'm clever ho's give what I need

(Verse 1-Kurupt)
Hey bitch, what you lookin at me strange fo'
Askin me if a nigga drive a Range Rov'
Whatever reason you may have on your mind
It must be coke or grass on your mind
Kickin back like you lost all your mind
I'mma put my foot in your behind
Until you got footprints on your behind
I'm cool at the club
I love it when the ladies do what they love
Pass around hugs
Whatever she done to get the ones ain't my concern
I'm live in the club, nickel sacks and dubbs
If you wanna strip ain't my concern

(Chorus X2-Butch Cassidy)
A bitch ain't nothin to me
Now let me tell you cuz I'm quick to put them ho's on the street
Make 'em bow down on they knees and do whatever
Cuz I'm clever ho's give what I need

(Verse 2-Roscoe)
Let's get on the good foot and do the bad things
Prayin donkey to Chinese shag swing
I'm a young Austin Powers, get tossed for hours
If I'mma do ya I'm use the Kama Sutra when we shaggin
Have ya braggin, to all your homegirls
About this young thug who can rock ya world
Tellin 'em all how you wish you could be my girl
And I got skirts from the bottom to the top of the world
See I'm on top of the world, why you mad at her?
Get used to it I'm popular girl
Pop in love with the girls, and I do it just like Kurupt
I wanna see you happy, doin what you love
Especially when what you love is me
Makin sure I keep plenty bud and bubbly
You know the rules ma, it's just the thug in me
Now pay pimpin, or raise up from underneath, ya dig?

(Chorus X2-Butch Cassidy)
A bitch ain't nothin to me
Now let me tell you cuz I'm quick to put them ho's on the street
Make 'em bow down on they knees and do whatever
Cuz I'm clever ho's give what I need

(Verse 3-Butch Cassidy)
Bitch been sad before, but some niggas ran just ain't learnin though
I don't want your ho so tell me what you fightin fo'
Once we all were cool but now he stressin got him actin like a fool
I gotta keep my distance now, it ain't my fault that ho's confused

(Chorus X2-Butch Cassidy)
A bitch ain't nothin to me
Now let me tell you cuz I'm quick to put them ho's on the street
Make 'em bow down on they knees and do whatever
Cuz I'm clever ho's give what I need[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
I took two nickels and made a dime out it
I took two words and made a rhyme out it
It's hard to explain it, but I did it while I'm tainted
Steady rippin' while I'm crippin', dip the shine out
I check my rear view
I tip it down a little, just to get a clear view
I got the pigs on me, I got the dips on em
So I slide, swerve, and try to dip on em
Make a smooth getaway, so clean
My windows smoke green, my endo super supreme
When the lights hit the bitch that shit turns green
But in the daytime, that motherfucker whip cream

[Hook: Terrace Martin]
My coup baby blue
Aye Snoop, what it do?
Aye Quik, where it's at?
Kurupt start the 'Lac
So we can bounce, rock, rollerskate and
Dippin' down the shore on platinum Daytons

[Verse 2: Terrace Martin]
My eyes like a strobe light, won't stop blinking
Brains like a stop sign, I can't stop thinking
Ten shots of Patron
Fall back at the mouth, now you know it's on
Lex pass my cellphone, so I can hit Big Snoop and Quik
Stroll to the valley cause it's time to dip
And the DJ didn't already play our shit

[Verse 3: DJ Quik]
A little bit of Quik is worth all you've got
Life is like a pussy, you should you a shot
My foot is in my pool behind my big ass crib
Captain Morgan Spiced Rum, no coke, Mr. Pibb
When there ain't a menage on the back of my spot
Bad bitches just lounging, only bottoms, no bra
Ponytail on my neck, who do I think I am?
Reggae music is blasting, eight is down to a gram
Now let's go to your hood, MTV playin' jams
Niggas wearin' your couch down, wishing they were I am
You're the colour of money, and your weed looks like Autumn
And the pockets on your jeans look like they did when you bought em
I feel you nigga, I hate me too
I wish you could make these bossy player moves that I do
I'm exotic, I'm eccentric, I'm erotic relentless
And if Snoop Dogg is the king then you know who the prince is
Now crown me the Quikness
Terrace Martin, Kurupt Young Gotti, now this is senseless
Who in the world would've thought that we would get this?
Know what I think?
I think your counter-free rapper-printer is all out of ink
You missed the glory days
Not to be told when the story's phased
Cut you in the days
Chickens open up their legs and give me all their eggs
Blame them and blame me
And fuck it for that sanctity and hopin' I done pull out when I came

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Kurupt]
You call that swag? I call that jag
Snatch off with a couple scuffles, chickens, and duffle bags
Mathematician calculating ounces and grams
Miami the Amityville, skittles and candymen
High off of all types; the vikes to the sands
Yeah, hunna stunna, the manish candyman
What up? The iron in any hand
Crush em like soda cans
Aroma or green the tan as the kush burns man
The bird in the hand and some urine in the bush
Fricking seeing these Vaseline bunny rappin' rabbits
It's a habbit

[Hook][Verse 1 - Malice]
You'll never catch these fugitives, this high speed
With hoppin' water, see-thru blue on jet skis
They twist trees, bend in they head to run my single
Mean while we minglin' chicks that's bilingual
Haters be like we sick of them, niggas in the whip sippin' gin
Switchin' lanes without signalin'
But they watch they mouth, because my dogs they ignorant
While I'm laid back, rockin' the Link, fuck what ya'll think
Stress-free, index finger mixing my drink
You see we hot like two 4-5th with gold clips
Ain't none of y'all fuckin' with this, it's hopeless
Malice on that raw shore shit, cut your throat shit

[Hook x2 - Clipse]
This is for my thug hustlers, dealers and gun runners
To my niggas locked, holdin' it down in body numbers
Think of the Clipse when the whole clique in black hummers
Stackin' them chips and let them tricks get nothing from us

[Verse 2 - Noreaga]
I'm wit' Kurupt, in L.A., you know, my main homie
Readin' books by thugs, it's like Monster Cody
Get on some N.O. shit, like what up woady
Hey yo, off top, I'm like Puff, just won't stop
I get drunk and hit them hoes with the Smirnoff cock
Neptunes lace the beat that'll rock your block
I'm movin' on like Mya and Silkk
We don't mix like Hinny and milk
I got the cover and grill
Now, everybody a thug, look what I built
I keep it hot, while them sissy niggas been done chill
I let 'em live, you know I could've had them killed
Five thousand and one, faylaced by Troy
Fuck with Nore then you know that you some dumb boy
Me and Clipse got clips for ya'll faggots and boy
What!

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Kurupt]
I blaze rhymes, nine days it's like Vietnam
My nigga Nore run 'round wit' a block in his palm
I'm a specialist at this with, twist cock insist (what's that)
All your money homie, ain't nothin' funny homie
You gotta fat bitch, I bet she can eat a big fat dick with big ass lips
Triangle the game, changin' the game
Sweet arrange, make all the hoes bounce
Neptunes blaze an ounce
Now all the hoes strippin', all the niggas trippin'
D.P. sippin', hittin' switches
What you tryin' to do homie, tryin' touch me
Cock back and bust, screamin' mother fucker
Blaze up a sack, I wonder where the gangsters at
Where the thugs are at, where all the bustas and slugs are at
I'm a general, raw dog assassin homie
Assassin nigga, bitch nigga, be blastin' nigga
I'm a pimp, I'm a g, something you wanna be
Malice and Terror said bust two to the head, bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 4 - Pusha T]
I spit that raw shit, ya'll niggas is tailor-made
Fine, Clipse and Nore, racin' the Palisades
Or in the hovercraft floatin' the Everglades
Whatever the setting, count on we renegades
In bandanas, remind you of Santana
Joints fully auto, shells out of bananas
This triangle's strong, these walls never be torn
Love is love, all our hearts are warm
Try to infiltrate, you feelin' more than the norm
The barrage'll are hollows hit hard like bridge storms
Even in the pristine, Chapel of the Sistine
I'm still prone to leave you glistenin'
I'll mouth to you what joy does this bring
And stagger away home withdrawn and whistling
I speak in this vain so you know what lines to cross
You can start breathin' again, Terror signin' off

[Hook x2][Snoop Dogg]
Ride, ride
Rough, ride on, ride on
Roll on, roll on
What!, what!, what!
Ride on, ride on, roll on
Nigga what!, w-w-what!, what!, w-w-what!
Ride on

[Kurupt]
This is the game you wanna spit to a nigga
Let a nigga know it's all right, cascades
And G'z stompin' on niggas like parades
Escapades and charades played
When the stampede stopped
And it continuously Young Gotti
Seen so many bodies
Drop fours hop classics and drastic measures
Principle's a pleasure and penal endeavours
Whatever the case, whatever case, it's caught on a chase
When a chase, it began in the facial of race
Me and Fred, he make beats, I make rhymes
And Snoop, he controls and calculates
Impervious moves, the Pound Pentagon
Wit a pistols, I holla where the gangstas' at
Daz poppin' his coller, nigga sweet and sour
Pop Chucks and collers, rollin' through the streets in my '84 Impala

[Snoop Dogg]
Holla, holla, if you wanna
We gon' run it from the co'na, it's the killa Califo'nia
Ya see, I do it to ya
Cause I know it screw ya, ya try up do us
But you can't cause you lovin' this beat
Uh, uh... we dump, dump to make you pump, pump
We comin' wit the heat to make ya trunk bump
Freddy said he had a whole a gritty down to go steady
And stick up Eddie for his fedy and bring it all back to daddy
I want bread, cheese now put it on the patty
Knick Knack style, kick back and flip files
In the verge, on now listen now honey child
Bow Wow, do ya now, how ya like it doggystyle?
Smile and grinnin', sippin' on some gin'n
Roll wit a cap and ya all strapped in
Once ya back in, it's straight mackin'
I keep it crackin'

[Hook - 4x]
This is how we all get down
Bring back that "G" shit fo' me!

[Snoop Dogg]
I know I slept you, kept ya, fin'na fetch ya
Snatch ya back too, slapped you and rapped too
The vacuum sat 'chu and rat packed you, act two
Now what must I do, to get you back
To the way is used to see, D-P-G-C'ology
I'm not talkin' 'bout chemistry or biology
This "G"'ology, you feelin' me
Niggas be killin' me and willin' me
Silly he, thinkin' y'all gon' smash on me
Blast on me, the audacity
I'll take ya back to the ol' skool and let ya cut class wit me
Get some ass wit me
Then get us somethin' to drink and let you sip out the same glass as me
And now you a killa
And it was all over weed and a tall can of milla, illa
Kill a nigga like a flea
Bigg Snoopy D-O double gizzle
Way off tha hizzle my nizzle

[Goldie Loc]
I hit niggas and bitches if you fuck wit my mental
Cause I'm a killa and stick release ya pop like a pimple
If you don't got my money I suggest you run
Cause the Gold Loc, he do you like a 20 or done
Ain't no fun the way I play, nigga I plays fo' keeps
No details you've just been sweeped to sweep
Locations, directions, not even a trace
Bitch I doubt it, if ya body get found like waste
In the alley, killa Cali, this Eastsidaz Crips
Never slip, set trip, and smoke chronic dip
Cuz!

[Hook -4x]

[Traci Nelson]
Snoop Doggy Dogg has to give it to ya
Fredwreck got the reefers bumpin' through ya
Goldie Loc can put the G and the C
Wit Kurupt Young Gotti from the D-P-G

[Kokane - Harmonizing]

[Daz]

[Birdman]
So light it up and pass the thang to me

Can smell it in my clothes you can smell it in my seats
That's how a nigga rolls I was raised in them streets
I'm rolling up a sweet, I'm fillin' it with keef
I'm too high to talk bitch, keep it real brief
IF it ain't about money, you don't even gotta speak
I smoke it in a paper, Weezy smoke it in a leaf
And nigga I'mma Stunna, I got runnas
And we keep them shotguns like hunters
We smoke thunder, it put me under
I'm talkin' bout straight purple kush that fungus
See I be fuckin' with them trees, cuz I'm straight out tha jungle

Smokin' up the Cali, smokin', smokin' up the Cali

I'll pull up the Henny, Coke and light up that dro

[Lil Wayne]
I get my kush from California, get my dro from Arizona
I can get it cross the boarder, I got a Ryda name Winona
And I be calmer than a soma, inside of the phantom
And it's lookin' like a sauna, and I still stay high and I still got my diploma
And I still keep the maggie on me like a Homer
And I'm too sick, man, I'm spittin' out a coma
And I'm still lettin' the money pile like goma
And I smoke that kill, ya'll blowin' on begonias
And I keep a field of that grass like a farmer
And I keep that armor, try me and I'll spin you around
I'll be with the stars and I ain't talkin' Tinsel Town
That's right the prince in town, bitches tear the fences down
Like prince in town, boy I shits a pound of that purple rain on the marvin's day
You wit me now? Too high you can't set me down

[Hook x2]

[Daz]
We got that AK47 white right on set painted

[Hook x2][Intro]
Welcome to California
Remix (echo)

[Verse 1 - Mack 10]
Uh Westcoast
Mack 10, Sly Boogy and the rest of the homies, look...

See I was raised at the gutter
And no matter what happened I got that raw cane & water
I ain't dependin' on rappin'
And I ain't wit the disrespect, watch ya mouth when ya yappin
I grab the homies and some bullies, hit ya block and start clappin
And I got so much aqua, my traps got floods on it
Gettin' that rubber band money and who cares if Bloods is on it
Mack 10, one of the few West Coasters to shine
And most of them got the mainstream, the hood is mine

[Verse 2 - Jayo Felony]
Man, I'm quick to tell a killer that I'm iller than he is
See, and I'm a G since it's me and my peeps, please
Look I'm the quickest no stitches, hit switches
And I love these witches that be gobblin' snobbishness
We takin' wrist watches, we be plottin' on change main
Why did I hit you up? Homie this is the gang thang
Can't hang with us gorillas, main, you just an orangutan
Sly and Bullet Loco gone bring these killers PAIN!

[Verse 3 - Sly Boogy]
Right, aight, hold up, trip (ha ha!)
Me and my niggas came to blow up shit (yeah)
And show these niggas how to flow that spit (yeah)
And quit actin' like some ho-ass tricks (Sly Boogy)
Fool, you know who the hell it is (yeah)
I'm clickin' up wit all my cousins and relatives
And you could roll wit us and rep yo block
And we could show these motherfuckers how the West Coast rock
So come on

[Hook - Butch Cassidy]
Everybody all around the world (yeah)
All the little baby boys and girls (alright)
Can't sleep cause they wanna know what's goin' on in California
All the seeds all across the globe
People comin' from coast to coast
For the show cause they wanna know what's goin' on in California

[Verse 4 - E-40]
Talk to me, I talk back, ain't no need to explain
Y'all know my name
Y'all know who this is rappin' over this steel trap
Y'all know it's the man wit the slang
Use no pedal when pushin' that cane
Everything that I ever sold in the street it was top grade
Magazines, three mics, sprinkle truth in the game, spit the venom
Every rapper got a little E-40 up in em
Every rapper off the heezy fo sheezy
I thought you plot 'em wit Jigga down
For shit got down

[Verse 5 - Kurupt]
Switches, bitches, chrome deep dishes
Impalas, pop collars and pop collar bones
It's California, Gangstaville, in ya mouth, all up on ya
Cologne, you California
I'm Chuck All Stars, chronic sack, skull hat, Nissan truck
Not to give a fuck, Kurupt
86 gang bang, World War 3
Thunder Dome, Crenshaw, Chemical Ali
California nigga!

[HOOK]

[Verse 6 - Crooked I]
The women hop in the whip
They love the way the speakers be subbin' in eight places
I represent Cali like Governor Gray Davis
On roller coaster rims, I own my own company pal
I'm slangin' spinners, how you lovin' me now
In L.A. you gotta be do or die in junior high
He's Sly Boogy, I'm Crooked I and we ride - you know?
And I'm Death Row, heartless and lethal
You seen Menace to Society, I should start in the sequel
Yeeah

[Verse 7 - Roscoe]
Blaze up the sticky dro, raise up the '64
Sittin' low at the liquor store
He's better than generous, inconsiderate
On a shwe wit a cigarette
You know that nigga Young Roscoe rollin' in the Cadillac
Rag on these (on these)
I got my Khakillac saggin' wit the crease
And everybody wanna know like, "what's up wit Sco?"
It's Y.A. Killafornia!

[Verse 8 - 2Pac]
Know for doin' scandalous deeds, no handlin' me
And nah it ain't the drugs, it's the straight thug nigga in me
I swoop down and cause havoc
My rapid delivery is automatic, lettin' niggas have it
I been labelled as a thug nigga
Since they don't sell my shit to white folks, ship it to the drug dealers
And catch a, catch a nigga worldwide
A fucking Mob Figga, West Coast who ride

[HOOK]

(Outro)

We hope you have enjoyed your stay (echo)
Think about this stuff (echo)[Intro: Kurupt]

Yeah, you know
The problem with most of these niggas nowadays
They ain't got no respect
See, life ain't just about all that other shit you lookin' at my nigga
You know, I love it on the Westside
That's why I pose with the homies, we smoke, drink, raise kids and make this motherfuckin' money
You hear me?

[Verse 1: Masta Killa]

My killa Cali gangsters a ride for me
Got brothers in the bay that'll die for me
Got the best weed smoke choke no seeds
Mexicans, crip, blood we all one seed
Shout the game, Snoop, Cypress Hill, B Real and real soldiers
Like Pac I still Feel
So I still ride dirty with the 5th steel
Got Kurupt young gotti with the semi shotty
My brother Power in the Maybach counting big money
The Cali sunshine but it ain't all sunny
Brothers dieing everyday and I pray for them
Falling soldiers in my heart where I still hold them
I feel I owe them
My brother coming home
On parole looking swoll
Young and old time to get gold so let's roll
These words that I write and recite is from the soul

[Verse 2: Kurupt]

Indo weed, extra green
Texture, extra, orange and green
Next to Inspectah Deck it seems
The reala Masta Killa and young gotti
I got to hit New York and push pass the kush hash
Big Snoop and Daz want to push past
Indo weed, and feeling fine
I'mma do this shit as well then again at nine
See, I'm cut from a different cloth
Got it? Got it?
I'm cut from a different cloth
Bodyguard hard, you niggas are soft
See you niggas ain't loyal
You don't know how stay down and play your position
Get a new fitting
Fitting the function, you's an undercover clown
I was born to push a concrete line
I change lives, I enhance my eyes
I'm Magneto, Magneto, aniyo
The one that can pose the metal at all times
If you look, you find
Close eyes to blind
Look
