[Intro]
Ya'll tryna' make a next motherfuckin' scene up in here, huh?
It's like Shmurda she wrote
How much shmoneys that? Ah ah ahh, ah, ah, ahh
Ah, ahh

[Verse]
In Truey, I'm some hot nigga
Like I talk to Shyste when I shot niggas
Like you seen him twirl then he drop, nigga
And we keep 'em nine millis on my block, nigga
And Monte keep it on him, he done dropped niggas
And Trigger he be wildin', he some hot nigga
Tones known to get busy with 'em Glocks, nigga
Try to run down and you can catch a shot, nigga
Runnin' through these checks 'til I pass out
And shorty give me neck 'til I pass out
I swear to God, all I do is cash out
And if you ain't a ho, get up out my trap house
I been sellin' crack since like the fifth grade
Really never made no difference what the shit made
Jaja taught me flip 'em packs and how to maintain
Get that money back and spend it on the same thing
Shawty like the way that I ball out
I be gettin' money 'til I fall out
You talkin' cash, dog, I goes all out
Shorty love the way that I floss out
Free Greezy though, let all of my dogs out
Mama said no pussy cats inside my doghouse
That's what got my daddy locked up in the dog pound
Free Phantom though, let all of my dogs out
We gon' pull up in that hooptie, like we cops on 'em
With M16's, we gon' put some shots on 'em
I send a lil thot to send the drop on 'em
She gon' call me up and I'm a sick the hots on 'em
Grimey savage, that's what we are
Grimey shooters dressed in G-Star
GS9, I go so hard
But GS for my gun squad
And bitch if it's a problem we gon' gun brawl
Shots poppin' out the AR
I'm with Trigger, I'm with Rasha, I'm with A-Rod
Broad daylight and we gon' let 'em things bark
Tell 'em niggas free Meeshie, ho
Some way, free Breezy, ho
And tell my niggas, Shmurda teamin', ho
Mitch caught a body about a week ago
Fuck with us and then we tweakin', ho
Run up on that nigga, get to squeezin', ho
Everybody catching bullet holes
Niggas got me on my bully, yo
I'm a run up, put that gun on 'em
I'm a run up, go dumb on 'em
Niggas got me on that young shit
Got me on that go dumb shit

[Outro]
Got me on that go dumb shit, man
Trap mode in this motherfucker, hotter than a bitch
Ayo, pour up, I need some more drank[Hook]
The money turned me into a monster
The money turned my noodles into pasta
The money turned my tuna into lobster
They want to do me I maneuver like a mobster

[Verse 1]
4 A.M. I'm on the north side of Philly
Riding around like these haters don't want to kill me
It's a shame how they hate on me you gotta feel me
I started out with a dollar and got a milli
I'm like do it for the gram ho, do it for the gram ho
She don't want to bust it I say do it for them bands yo
I say do it for them bands fucking with that broke nigga you should do it for your man
Lately I've been on the low with a ho that you probably know
Took her to the crib and met momma right at the door
Momma started smiling like momma I got to go
I done took so many trophies to momma my momma know
I said a real nigga, I get that money pay them bills nigga
My momma told me "you a real nigga"
And I be hanging with them real killers
Now what a feeling when you looking at the latest whip and knowing you can cop it
Or looking at the baddest bitch and knowing you could pop it
The youngest nigga in my city doing it, I got it
On another level with Benjamin and money is the topic
Lord

[Hook]

[Post-Hook]
I put my jeweler on his feet
Hundred thou I used to do that every week
Never sleep it's funny how it never speak
You see a foreign in my city that was me

Verse [2]
That was us, never sweet
We went to war, niggas riding down the street
Popping that pistol they talking they never did
Dropping the nickel with something that never cease
I've been sitting on that money like a chair
I've been getting to that money all year
All year and my niggas all here
But we started from the bottom we was selling hard squares
Baddest bitch in the game wearing my chain, I'm ready
Switching lanes in that Mulsanne like I'm Andretti
I do the Balmain, Balenciaga, no Giuseppe
If they sleep on Meek Milly I kill these niggas like I was Freddy
I eat that pussy like a monster
She gon' ride this dick, she need a sponsor
You could tell I'm Philly from my posture
And we be whipping coca like it's pasta
I be on money, 2 milly 4 milly no I need more money
I get that "see a bad bitch and be like how you doing" money
They be like how you doing honey oh

[Hook] + [Post-Hook][Produced by Jahlil Beats]

[Intro]
Girl, he got shmoney

[Hook] x2
She all about her shmoney, she don't fuck with broke niggas
She don't with broke niggas, she don't fuck with broke niggas

[Verse 1]
Lil bitch, go and shake that ass for these tips
Come bring it back and do a split on this dick
For a couple bands, she'll shmoney dance on this dick
Pussy so good, I went to France with the bitch
Damn, she look good when she back that ass up
Damn, I look good when I stack the cash up
I'mma lay a lil nigga now, don't forget it now
Pussy nigga good, boy, you know I tear it down
Broke niggas talking but I can't hear 'em now
Pussy niggas play, boy, you know I sit 'em down
Fool nigga play with me, I make his brains hit the floors
Smoke some good weed with my bitch and watch hit the floor
I done roll through the door, make some bands with the bitch
Like you never see me walk in holdin' hands with the bitch
I'mma lay a lil nigga, don't fuck with broke niggas
And she all about her shmoney, she don't fuck with broke niggas

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2: Bobby Shmurda]
Walk up in this bitch throwing C-notes
With some G Code, got her in the back yelling "East coast"
Little bit of Henny with some weed smoke
And some Clicquot , told my freak ho "Keep my drink, ho"
She gon' pop that pussy for the week though
Every weekend, tell her I need some pussy and some deep throat
She gon' do that thing until her knees broke
On the d-low, baby, we ain't through like 3 bros
(?) told my nigga go in beast mode, I'm in beast mode
Shooting niggas for the cheap, ho
Nigga only owed the nigga 30, yeah 30
Then I shot him with the eagle
Cause a nigga got a big ego, I’m illegal, bustin’ shots like it’s legal
Cops tryna find me like I’m Nino
I’m in Reno, geeking hoes down like I’m Z-Ro

[Hook] x2

[Verse 3: Too $hort]
Bitch boy, you can't tell me shit
I'm the kinda nigga she wanna be with
You the kind of nigga she likes right now
VIP and just spent 5 thou'
Get it right, welcome to the stage
Pull some cash out your pocket and watch her get paid
I know you tryna' hit that, if you ain't got enough dick for that
Big cat, she'll probably make you spend a lil more
Or maybe you should go
Silly ass pimps out there playing with these hoes
I'm a real one, ask her what she want from me
It's nothing, I'll show her how to get money
If he don't throw it in the air, he better not touch her
She don't love you, man, she nothing but a hustler
Fuck yeah, hell naw, she won't fuck you
Take her to your spot, boy, the bitch light rocks

[Hook] x2[Meek Mill]
I just wanna thank God
For all the pretty women he let into my life
All the Benjamins you let me count
Wealth and health
For my family
And lettin' me ball on these niggas

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Now there's a lot of bad bitches in the building (Amen)
A couple real niggas in the building (Amen)
I'm finna kill niggas in the building (Amen)
I tell the waiter fifty bottles and she tell me say when
And I say church (Preach)
We make it light up like a church (Preach)
She wanna fuck and I say church (Preach)
Do Liv on Sunday like a church (Preach)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Bottle after bottle, drink until I overdose
Pull up in the Phantom, watch them bitches catch the Holy Ghost
Errtime I step up in the dealer I be goin' broke
Shorty wanna fuck me, I say get on top and roller coast
And I lay back, she go cray, fuck me good, but she no stay
Murder on that pussy let her boyfriend get that DOA
Get it? And all I get is Frito Lay
Plus I'm on probation, when they test me I just pee Rosé
Cause last night, I went hard, Peach Ciroc, Patron and all
Thirty racks on magnum bottles, I think I was born to ball
Lookin' like a million plus, fresh I'm out that corner store
Hater I be doin' me, you guys should be doin' y'all
I'm stackin' money to the ceiling
All this ice that's in my Rollie I be chilling
And I just made a couple million
So I could take care of them children, let's go

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Drake]
Just bought my niggas some caine, so much it came with a plane
Bought my niggas some dope, so much it came with a boat
I just bought me a crib so big it came with a moat
For niggas jumping the fence I hope you niggas can float
And I just hope that I'm forgiven for carin' 'bout how they livin'
And loanin a little money and keepin' 'em out of prison
I ain't lyin' in my verses I'm just telling you the basics
Of growin' up with your friends and becoming the one that made it
Yes lord! All gold, man I got these bitches soul
Talking bout these other rappers getting old is even getting old
Worrying about your followers, you need to get your dollars up
Me and Meek, young niggas poppin' like our collars up
And good ain't good enough, and your hood ain't hood enough
Spent my whole life putting on, you spend your whole life putting up
Ain't no telling when I go, so there ain't shit that I'mma wait for
I'm the type to say a prayer, then go get what I just prayed for

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Meek Mill and Jeremih]
Lord forgive me for my sins, I'm just tryna win
And she a devil in a dress but if she knock I let her in
And if she knock I let her in
I have her wet by 12 o' clock, then 3 o' clock she wet again
I'm screaming Oh Lord, that pussy good, that pussy good
I'm tryna hold on, I wish I could, you think I should
She got that million dollar body, shorty my Bugatti
And she said she got a man, we keep it secret Illuminati
(Got Patron on deck) And Ciroc all in my bottle
(Push it all on her) She was on that Reposado
(She take it all off) And I think I'll rep Serato
In this bitch I'm spending like I hit the lotto cause it's a lot of...

[Hook][Verse 1: Meek Mill & Big Sean]

[Big Sean & Meek Mill]
God (Yea)
Oh God, Boi, (Yea)
G.O.O.D. (MMG, Nigga)

[Meek Mill]
Chain all V.S. I ain't with the B.S
Catch me in your city riding hard through the B.X
Skinny nigga but I do it large like a 3X
The last nigga tried to do me wrong umm he checked
Right back to that money slinging O's in the p-jects
Or prolly catchin mileage while the pilot steer the P-Jet
Cause we next and we flex like

[Big Sean]
90PX, working all night no breaks or a recess
Vroom vroom yeah I know my car sound like a T-Rex
Bitch, I'm 23 years old and I ain't riding in a Prius
My cousin finished school can't believe he graduated
Threw him 20,000 dollars told his ass congratulations
Cause me... I wasn't made for that shit
But I could probably hire him and who all paid for his shit
And to all the hoes that was dissin' I pray to God that you see me
I'm on a yacht getting hella' high smoking good that seaweed
Bad bitch in her cha-cha grabbing on her chi-chi's
Million dollar deals on my email you mad as hell you ain't CC'ed
Chain all V.S. bitch you knows it's B.S. boy I run my city

[Meek Mill]
End of story, nigga P.S
All white Maybach, Green Bay they packing
Y'all niggas was slackin' 'member the hard nights we trappin'
And they say lifes a game of chess you can play checkers all on my jacket
Cause it's Damier and we bombs away on y'all big rappers
I say yeah nigga I murder that Panamera turtle back
Niggas say they want beef, well where the fuck is my burger at?
I got white, was serving that -- I been to jail, I ain't going back
I alley oop your bitch off that backboard she throw it back

That's cause I do ho, shout out to my new ho
That pussy pink like Nuvo and I dog that Cujo

[Hook: Big Sean & Meek Mill]

[Big Sean]
Niggas wanna talk what they gon' say (gon' say)
I hit the pedal til that motherfucker break (til it break)
Freaky bitches love the money I make
And to live like this you motherfuckers gotta pay
So let that shit burn

[Meek Mill]
Let that shit burn I'mma let that shit burn let that shit burn (burn, gasoline)
The roof on fire I'm only gettin' higher
50 racks all in my pocket I want bottles I'mma let that shit burn

[Verse 2: Big Sean & Meek Mill]

[Big Sean]
Bitch, I had one shot and I ain't blow it
Riding til the wheels fall off and they tow it
I got green on top of green damn its looking like I grow it
D-Town the hood behind me like a king cobra

[Meek Mill]
Burn bitch I let it burn bitch
My money straighter than a motherfucking perm bitch
No navigation you can see it is my turn shit (swirv, swirv)
Shorty give me all that brain still ain't never learned shit

[Big Sean]
Oh that's your girl? Damn nigga you ain't learn shit
She naked in my studio I'm on that Howard Stern shit
I swear that mac 10 is my barbell, Finally Famous the cartel
Hit your girl in my whip and now that pussy got the new car smell
Same shit different day I ain't broke no more it's a different day
Don't turn me down I got shit to say my purp strong like it's lifting weights
It's Sean Don sippin' Chandon I got a bad bitch with them pom pom's
My Rollie don't tick-tock your shit sound like a time bomb, boom...lil' bitch

[Hook][Produced by Jahlil Beats]

[Intro]
I'm sorry for the wait, nigga
I'm tighter than these pussy hoes, I'm chafe, nigga
Pockets full of crumbs, I'm a breadwinner

[Verse]
I'm sorry for the wait, nigga
I'm aiming at your Beats by Dr. Dre, nigga
I put up some ornaments today nigga (Why?)
Cause 'round here every day a holiday, niggaaa
This that Sorry 4 The Wait 2
That AK shoot like K do
Had to tell myself, 'Tune just stay tuned'
Swear I got the hardest flo', my shit break brooms
I been hot since 1998, nigga
That's 98 degrees, Nick Lachey, nigga
Hope you know the Feds got Instagram
They liking every photo that you take, nigga
I was totin a gun before a switchblade
Cut your head off and put it on display
Boy, we find out where you live and then we invade
Boy, we do not kill no kids, but your bitch dead
Ooh, shawty like the way that you floss out
Til I shoot you in the head, now she grossed out
I'm the boss, you just heard it from the horse mouth
I told a nigga count on me and niggas lost count
This world is only preparation for the next (Alright)
Money bags under my eyes, money over rest
Tryna get a hunned M's out the alphabets
Open up my mouth to smile, ooh treasure chest
Ooh, DJ Stevie J keep the Glock on him
I just bought a new .44 and I'm a proud owner
Belfast and Monroe, that was our corner
Fuckin fast in your ho, ooh cowabunga
Sip some lean, pop a Xan bar
My bougie bitch pussy taste like caviar
Once I fuck a bitch, her pussy is a landmark
I don't know how you like your steak, but I'm in rare form
Fuck them bitchass niggas, fuck whoever care for 'em
Momma jumped out a plane, I was air-borne
Gold watches, gold chains; watch for Leprechauns
Favorite subject was PE, Pablo Escobar
Kill him when he least expect it, at a restaurant
Throw him with the rest of 'em, in a reservoir
I'm the renaissance man, peep my repertoire
Excuse my French, but it's menage a trois, au revoir
Oooh, my Nina Ross got a bad mouth
Yea, I'm consuming grass like a cash cow
Give a fuck 'bout a police with his badge out
If you ain't got a warrant, get up out my damn house!
This that Sorry 4 The Wait 2
This a all white affair, I brought the yay through
She said Tunechi skate through, and I'mma skate you
I'm aimin at your grapefruit, blaow, grape juice
Ooh, tell them bitches; free dick and blow
Give me head... Can't kiss no mo'
I got; free jewelry, car keys, and more
And I just started robbin like a week ago
Hundred diamonds on my bitch, I don't bling no more
Two hunned thousand for a show
You gotta speak to Po
Yeah, got me on my Young Money shit
No Cash Money, just Young Money shit
Wooh, got me on my Young Money shit

[Outro]
My nigga Chaz Ortiz in this bitch with me
Mula![Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Look I be riding through my old hood, but I'm in my new whip
Same old attitude but I'm on that new shit
They say they gon' rob me, see me never do shit
Cause they know that's the reason they gon' end up on a news clips
Audemar on my wrist, bust-down
We poppin bottles like I scored the winning touchdown
Remember me dead broke? Look at me, up now
I run my city from South Philly back to Uptown
Thank god, all these bottles I popped
All this paper I been gettin, all these models I popped
I done sold 100,000 before my album got dropped
And I'm only 23 I'm the shit now look at me
Look at me I'm a boss like my nigga Rozay
Shorty ask'd me for a check, I told that bitch like no way
Cause I made it from the bottom it was never no way
And I never had a job, you know I had to sell yay
Bitch I'm a boss, I call the shots
I'm with the murder team, call the cops
We in the building, y'all are not
You short on the paper, you gon' ball or not

[Hook]
Bitch, I'm a boss!
Bitch, I'm a boss!
I play the shots
I call the costs
We in the bitch
It's goin' down
Yeaa I'm the king
Now where my mu'fuckin' crown?
Bitch, I'm a boss!
Bitch, I'm a boss!
Bitch, I'm a boss!
Bitch, I'm a boss!
Bitch, I'm a boss!
Bitch, I'm a boss!
I play the shots
I call the costs

[Verse 2: Ricky Rozay]
Got so many shades they thought I had a lazy eye
Shorty rode me smooth as my Mercedes ride
No love cry when only babies die
And when I go that casket better cost a hundred thou
I pray to god I look my killer in his eyes
Snatch his soul out that shirt let's take him for that ride
OG is one who standin on his own feet
A boss is one who guarantee we gon eat
Fuck a blog dawg cause one day we gon' meet
I'm a spazz on yo ass like I'm Mo'nique
Or a double stack better nigga double that
Jerry Jones money nigga you a running back
Herschel Walker, Bo Jack
Ricky Watters, better run that dope back
Boss, and I put that on my Maybach
Fo' hundred thou' bitch you wish you saved that

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Couple cars I'ont never drive, bikes I'ont never ride
Crib I ain't never been, pool I'ont never swim
Fool you ain't better, I move like the president
Err thang black on black you know I be strappin that
Rattin ass niggas walkin round wearin wires
Fuckin up the game, got the hood on fire
Bitch I'm a king, call me "sire"
If you say I don't run my city you a muthafucking liar
Bitch I'm a boss, you a fraud
You cross the line, I get you murdered for a cost
Out in Vegas, I took a loss
At the fight we watchin' Floyd we on the floor
Scared money don't make no money
If I ever go broke I'mma take yo money
I ain't never dropped a dime, you ain't take nun from me
In the hood err day bitch I'm good what I say

[Hook][Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
These niggas don't beez in the trap, they like bees in this track
Just smoked out, I ain't talking 'bout what you toke out
Get choked out fo'rilly, thinking that this shit a silly dream
When actually reality ain't what it really seem
And I ain't acting on the scene niggas scream
The actions ain't screened, just well schemed
I'm trying to have wealth for my well being by 18
Pockets healthy green, what the fuck is 12 beans?
I need the cake and cream, stakes is high like fiends off a dream
Jet streaming having cuisine with the best seasons
It's the vet season carry a vest you know the reason
I'm in Chiraq and I'm getting blown like the breezes
Your chicken strip tease us, thighs leg and the breast part is the cleavage
She even lick it down to the bone marrow
She in love but I don't got a bow and arrow
I'm known to jack the booty like I'm sparrow
They ain't trying to see me in the battle, they lines is too narrow
They couldn't even outshine my shadow
They don't want the beef nigga let alone the cattle
They just want to ride the saddle, it's so sad though

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
Hammers present, you gettin' wrapped up
Uhh, jump out the Mack truck, black tux
Go 'head and act up, drink the blood out of the brass cup
Your jewels are fake those are glass cut
No snakes keep the grass cut
Thick dominican women skin cinnamon with they ass up
Sick spinning, I stay shitting like a sick pigeon
Different colors glisten of the wrist prism
Blicker off the hip hit 'em, spun 'em
Chopped an onion, in the process peeped the diagnostics
See my shorty draped up in an ostrich
Smoking weed from the doctor
As I sit on a train to Paris draped in fabric like an arabic
Mommy always knew her boy was talented
Come off tour give her 20 thou for nothing
Cause it's nothing to me I'm something to see
Sunk in the sea, Duncans on feet
Shits are shiny take a shower rather dump in the heat
Jump out the jeep looking fly like a bundle of geese, jeez
I'm on some shit
I'm talking 7 series triplets, bitches with military fitness
And my girl a shooter like Chamique Holdsclaw
With coke in the door, she used to play ball
For Christ the King, selling drugs got her the icy ring though
Me

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
The last black hippy to get a wiki
I'm in your city getting a hickey from your chick in her Vickies
Don't try act like I ain't popping homie
My style like Mandela meets Monster Kody
Cop backwoods by the box bro, OG only
Drop 460 for a zip, need 2 to be cozy
I hate to stunt but look me up
Evil Knievel ain't much when I do my stuff
Polo tee polo black cologne
Burberry by my nuts she won't leave me lone
The Levi's was on sale, but I ain't flexing hard
Flexing, never had a 24 Hour Fitness card
I told myself I wouldn't flip I made a little bit
I'm no magician but I hope this blue dolphin do the trick
Behind the mic with a thizz face
You take your Mrs. through my entrance thats a mistake
I got it bad like Usher Raymond
Middle finger to the plaintiff, screaming Top Dawg Entertainment
Look I don't know why you niggas hating
I take that back cause I know why you niggas hating
I just said it cause I likeded how it came in
I even used likeded, that ain't a word, I'm just saying
I got to be the greatest on this land, I spell high with
3 I's and I'll never never land
The rap Mike Jack, Peter Pan with 28 grams
Hendrix with no guitar, Albert on Adderall
Yeah, jug
Smoke 'til I'm Weezy don't worry what's in my cup

[Verse 4: Travis Scott]
Speeding, and damn I’m leaning, on the Kawasaki
In the lobby, got me dro codinein’, out in Abu Dabi
Chain beaming, hope it ain't anemic, cause you might feel drowsy
Out in Sweden, just me and four women, and we all playing hockey
Blow Scott La Flame, pimpin, no cane
Rocking the chain and hood with no pass
Fucked up the flow, nothing but fam cause niggas be hoes
Have that, pass that, light it up and then blow
Imagery abstract, it's like NASDAQ when I stock it up and then grow
Packed it up and moved to Goldman Sachs, my nigga Yeezy done taught me that
Young niggas in the Soho House spilling booze wherever the Barbies at
Damn homie, this a movie nigga, take a picture or somethin', where your Kodak at?
Scottie is tokin and swimming with women, he writing, producing, then score and filming it
Oh god, my god, this shit be like God-level
Nigga you talking money nigga, stacking several
Bonds over billions niggas the real is in the building
With Ye and Hova niggas know what the deal is
The deal is nigga the realest
Young Scott the rock, rocking from the Phyllis
Got my nigga Bronson, Joey, Ab-Soul
And you know a nigga pockets getting swole on the road, yup[Intro: Kid Ink]
Yeah, I tell 'em money on, huh

[Hook: Kid Ink]
I tell 'em 360, 360, 360
See the room spinning around, 360, 360, 360
Watch the money fall down, 360, 360, 360
Baby turn that ass around, 360, 360, 360

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
I know you see it go around, money full circle
Blunt in full circle, smoking on that colour purple
On the beat I go silly, real ugly motherfucker
Bitches love that I'm a rapper but she know I ain't a sucker
360, look might break your neck
Everybody double take now I'm late on set
Got a pocket full of green, faces like Gumbee
'Bout to take another round call it 720
Headed to the club going close in an hour
One on one on, East bound and down Kenny Powers
I just took off face look sour, I can here 'em screaming my name like Alvin
I'm just sitting back recline like Calvin
High you can see it in my eyes like Simon
Going way past 60
Girl I think you just missed me

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Yo I say what goes around comes around, 360
When it comes to bad bitches I keep three with me
One to fuck me good, one to suck me good
One to ride hard, hold the work tuck it good
Only thing I wish, I wish a motherfucker would
I'm living life and getting money like I fucking should
I'm on another level, that make you understood
Oh you ain't understanding, nigga I am making good
360, we make 'em 360
Popcorn looking like a box of rice crispy
If I don't make the record shit the feds gonna get me
Cause I'm gonna keep shining on these haters 'til they hit me
100 thousand dollars cash, $20 bills bitch, I be on that real shit
Tryna chase a mill shit
Just came back from Hollywood and Ill Will, the Will Smith
Right back to the hood with my goons tryna kill shit

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kid Ink]
I said bitch I'm the bomb, everything hunneds
'Bout to take another round call it 9-hunned
Call me when you sitting home alone like Mc Culkin
'Bout to leave the club but I don't know where the fuck the sun is
See me speeding through the city like we racing in a summit
I ball, might crossover, hop step, dunk it
360, leave the hole open in a fast break
Why you think yo girl ain't call since the last date?
Huh, I'm gone, backspace
I've been rozay red, cafe
Bunch of bitches on they tippi toes like ballet
Smoking all day, have an eight in the ashtray
Get it good, hit it's feeling like a facelift
I don't recycle motherfucker I'm wasted
I got a head like Gena
And my bitch got an ass like Trina

[Hook][Hook: ЯhÅPΣΩÐ™]
I recall back when daddy hid the J
Back when cokeboy use to paint the place
Had a humble heart, headed on my way
Grew up next to bars & I was only 8!

[Verse 1: ЯhÅPΣΩÐ™]
Now I’m 18 & I got shit to say
Slick talk a lot, that’s the way the haters play
Remember when I gave a fuck what a hater say
Kept a mental note, everday is hater day
I would pray the mixtape would keep the hate away
Big mistake aye it’s finna bring a hate array
Observate the hate display of the hater spray
Reinstate the hater rate, feed em hater bate

[Chorus: ЯhÅPΣΩÐ™]
MapleLeaf Bound, that’s a mission eh?
South ON, that’s where my city stay
Real Windsorites, to the starting gate
Bout to come up from my city in a major way

[Verse: 2]
Now I'm 17 I got shit to say
Switching other ways switching to the other lane
Done today, all we do is work n play
Rapping everday n so the haters hate

Isn't fuckin optional
Yo homie
Tell me what's possible
Really be n team be flawsin do
Fleet from the scene gettin green she gotta go-she gotta go

On steps and now she knockn doe
Never know what she told but she wan sum moore
Stepping mean with team-dream bout to blow
Mystery history what we haven't told

N we goin fo the fuckin gold
N we got it n own it like it fuckin sold
Dosnt even really mater who we fucking told
Hear this shit, words are clear n its fucking bold

Ball hard n they crying
Hear the siren
When n I'm flyin-assume donn get smacked

519 comeback

[Verse 3: ЯhÅPΣΩÐ™]
Then I come back!
That’s you girl?
Damn, have her bum back

Felt some typa way
Couldn’t keep a stray
Tell’er fall back

[Chorus: ЯhÅPΣΩÐ™]
MapleLeaf Bound, that’s a mission eh?
South ON, that’s where my city stay
Real Windsorites, to the starting gate
Bout to come up from my city in a different way

[Verse 4:]
Different way
Haters always got shit to say
Been told all we do is work n play
Keep it flowin like we pasing every single day
RTK stepping hard eh this is cray[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
I’m from the hard knock life, that all white life
Pop a wheelie on that 4 wheeler yea that's that bike life
Niggas ghost like casper catch me in a ghost with drop head after
You a slave master, rob your own kind blind lean blind
And I ain't join your team cause I got my own grind
Got my own mind, sold my own 9's, fifty five hundred like a hundred’s some times

[Hook: Yo Gotti]
Once you put your hand on that pot
Ain’t no turning around, ain’t no turning around
Once you bust your first Glock
Ain’t no turning around, ain’t no turning around
Once you jump off that porch (young nigga)
Ain’t no turning around, ain’t no turning around
These streets hot as a torch (young nigga)
Ain’t no turning around, ain’t no turning around

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
I’m from the hard knock life, that all black life
Making sales on a mountain bike, yeah, that’s that crack life
Break a whole one down and sell ‘em all nics
Couple days later, four door six
Love to let the semi spray every day’s a henny day
Fuck it they gon charge you like you an adult anyway
Yeah, just look at those that took a nap
When you’re on the road to riches, nigga, ain’t no looking back

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
Shots fired man down, says he was hands down
Police brutality, nigga, this reality
Trayvon Martin in a all black hoodie
Young nigga big 40 waiting on a bullet
Big benz is the world on drugs
Watching CNN and seen my god damn plug
Watching BET and seen my god damn self
I have more love for these streets than my god damn self

[Verse 4: Jadakiss]
Uhh Yea haha!
Young niggas wyling, shooting shit rapidly
To give him ten years, they do that happily
They don’t understand, they bringing down the faculty
Ain't worried about the fronters, it's the niggas that's in back of me
Grown man b.i., and that’s how they handle it
Reputation is everything, it’s over when you’re damaging
Money is easy to get, is just hard to manage it
Always remember the rules before you put your hand in it

[Verse 5: Yo Gotti]
Before you put your hand in it
You got to be the man in it
You got to understand it, got to know the rules to the game
Got to sacrifice, got to know it's a five year sentence for a brick of white
That's if your record clean Lord knows it’s a poor sight
Caugh up in the snitch, smash on em' you don't match now
Remember what I told you, fuck it, you can turn your back now
Once upon a time he was real, he a rat now
Never turn your back on niggas that you thug with
Bitch that you really like, never fall in love with
Never send your plug with the money up front
If you smoke get your own kush don't hit a nigga blunt
Remember dope gon sale and bitches gonna leave
Soon Niggas go to jail, so that’s a day from hell
Young nigga oh well, thinking he a player
Now he living through his pictures on the wall and his mail
But he ain’t tell, so nigga I salute em'
And when he hit the streets again, making sure he eat again
He gon' be a beast again, hit em' with a key again
For eighteen five, young nigga go live[Meek Mill]
I just wanna thank God
For all the pretty women he let into my life
All the Benjamins you let me count
Wealth and health
For my family
And lettin' me ball on these niggas

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Now there's a lot of bad bitches in the building (Amen)
A couple real niggas in the building (Amen)
I'm finna kill niggas in the building (Amen)
I tell the waiter fifty bottles and she tell me say when
And I say church (Preach)
We make it light up like a church (Preach)
She wanna fuck and I say church (Preach)
Do Liv on Sunday like a church (Preach)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Bottle after bottle, drink until I overdose
Pull up in the Phantom, watch them bitches catch the Holy Ghost
Errtime I step up in the dealer I be goin' broke
Shorty wanna fuck me, I say get on top and roller coast
And I lay back, she go cray, fuck me good, but she no stay
Murder on that pussy let her boyfriend get that DOA
Get it? And all I get is Frito Lay
Plus I'm on probation, when they test me I just pee Rosé
Cause last night, I went hard, Peach Ciroc, Patron and all
Thirty racks on magnum bottles, I think I was born to ball
Lookin' like a million plus, fresh I'm out that corner store
Hater I be doin' me, you guys should be doin' y'all
I'm stackin' money to the ceiling
All this ice that's in my Rollie I be chilling
And I just made a couple million
So I could take care of them children, let's go

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Drake]
Just bought my niggas some caine, so much it came with a plane
Bought my niggas some dope, so much it came with a boat
I just bought me a crib so big it came with a moat
For niggas jumping the fence I hope you niggas can float
And I just hope that I'm forgiven for carin' 'bout how they livin'
And loanin a little money and keepin' 'em out of prison
I ain't lyin' in my verses I'm just telling you the basics
Of growin' up with your friends and becoming the one that made it
Yes lord! All gold, man I got these bitches soul
Talking bout these other rappers getting old is even getting old
Worrying about your followers, you need to get your dollars up
Me and Meek, young niggas poppin' like our collars up
And good ain't good enough, and your hood ain't hood enough
Spent my whole life putting on, you spend your whole life putting up
Ain't no telling when I go, so there ain't shit that I'mma wait for
I'm the type to say a prayer, then go get what I just prayed for

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Meek Mill and Jeremih]
Lord forgive me for my sins, I'm just tryna win
And she a devil in a dress but if she knock I let her in
And if she knock I let her in
I have her wet by 12 o' clock, then 3 o' clock she wet again
I'm screaming Oh Lord, that pussy good, that pussy good
I'm tryna hold on, I wish I could, you think I should
She got that million dollar body, shorty my Bugatti
And she said she got a man, we keep it secret Illuminati
(Got Patron on deck) And Ciroc all in my bottle
(Push it all on her) She was on that Reposado
(She take it all off) And I think I'll rep Serato
In this bitch I'm spending like I hit the lotto cause it's a lot of...

(Verse 1: Chubby Jag)
Middle finger snapped and my bag already, funny how I got these niggas mad already
You are not that sick, I'd pop that chick
You would never fuck a bitch I'd had already
Before I met Cass, had cash already
Before I turned Chubby, I was Jag already
Can't wait for the day when a nigga get fans, you mean to tell me all that passed already
I don't know who fuck around me and my shit, I go to bed rooted just me and my clip
Two seater whip, with the heat on my right
And my 2Pac back, just me and my bitch
Understand, Comprende?
Squeeze off till it's empty, find out where his kid stay
By the block holmes, calling me Dikembe, Real NBA niggas calling me MJ
I'm still round, cause I've been here
No D round, no hood round
Still yelling out that we in here, If I play here
I'm gon' win here, I got the whip
So I got the chips, I got the fists
Big Poppa shit, I got the licks
So I got the bricks, Holmes
One word and I got the bitch, Chubby yup
Problems with me that K sparking, Roll around with them big faces
I'm talking way before J. Harden, Can't lose
I got chippers on it, good girls
And them strippers on it, I kill tracks
This beat need to be in them trash bags with the zipper on it
Stunt hard when I roll past, Nigga just want that cold cash
That 80's money, that old cash
No young money for my old ass, It's Larsiny it's our year now
Holmes, full speed, them gears down
I'm yelling out amen, Holmes
Gotta thank the Lord that we here now, You beating me
Fuck is you trying, I'm riding out in that coupe flying
Use to smoke like Snoop Dogg, now we smoking up like Snoop Lion
Got a bad bitch, send the most texts, I'm on that pussy
Cold text, fuck everyday
Cause a nigga gotta make up for all the years I got no sex
I'm on now, still I'm so next
In 4 years got no checks, Holmes
Next year if I ain't on that jet, walk around like Coach Rex
Real street, niggas hate then they feel heat
I'm so wrong, I smoke dro, I sell drugs
And I kill beats. Amen[Produced by Jahlil Beats]

Cause I am too busy living the life, pass me the drugs

Fuck niggas don't even think about it, that's a no no[Hook]
See we ain't got much in common, so we don't do that much talking
Sometimes it feels so awkward
She watch me take a shower, I asked her why she didn't join me
She said because you didn't ask me; I said, "Damn, I didn't think I had to"
Then she take off my towel, and I-I take off her blouse
I tell her that that pussy for me, just in case she thought it was ours
And she say cool

And if you like it I love it
If she like it I love it

[Verse 1]
See we ain't got much in common, so we don't do that much talking
Cause every time she try to tell me something, she open up her mouth, I stick my tongue in
She got a piercing in her vagina, a skirt with nothing under
And she say when she don't see me, she feels like Stevie Wonder

[Pre-Hook]
That's when I said, "Work, work, work
If you want that purse, skirt, shirt"
And she made me cum 100 times
She made me cum 100 times
Man, she got that work, work, work
I say you my bitch now, I'm calling you first
And then made her cum a 100 times
She kinda green but I'm color blind

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Uh, I like that shit
And she bite that lip when she like that dick
Ooh, I like that shit
And she bite that lip don't fight that dick girl, girl

Can you help me take another shower?
Then we gonna make each other shout

[Verse 2]
There's steam in the air, fog everywhere
She can get her hair wet cause it's her real hair
I be like, "Hell Yeah"
And she be like, "Fucking right"
Now she got one leg in the air, I'm pulling on her hair
And she say I can pull it, cause it's her real hair
She be like, "Hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah" cause I fuck her right

[Pre-Hook]

[Outro]
Then I said, "See we ain't got much in common
So we don't do that much talking
Sometimes it feels so awkward"[Intro – Meek Mill]
It’s the dream team bitch
Mr. Philadelphia
Philly in this bitch, Meek Million

[Verse 1 – Meek Mill]
All I ever wanted was a million and a bad bitch
Used to blow my money and wake up like where my stacks went
I was 17 left my crib, went where the cash went
And popped back in my hood in an Aston, mansion
Flying with the top off, and I’m getting topped off
I’m about my chicken bitch, and I spit that hot sauce
Mustard yellow Breitling, tell 'em catch up, I’m a hot dog
Hood nigga, but I live my life like I’m a rock star
Shot bar, fuck no, take me where the bottles at
Mr. Rose baby, get a lot of that
Copy that, roger that, I be where it’s popping at
Jahlil he put a hit out on that beat I b-b-body that
Imma take the offshore, baby, cause it costs more
Elevator take me to the top, right on the ball floor
Shawty tried to jump inside the coupe, can’t find the car door
Why you think I work so much and grind so fucking hard for

[Hook – Meek Mill]
Hey, bottles up, shawty drop me down
Ask who fucking with me, not a sound
Hear them haters talking, but they whispering
So what they saying bout me, cause I’m getting it
We ballin, we ballin
Ballin like it’s Spalding
Everytime I wake up all I hear is money calling
Ballin and ballin, tearing up the Martin
Call me Mr. wrecking ball the way I break them walls in

[Verse 2 – Shizz Nitty]
Fuck niggas and bitches
Ain’t Shizzy a dope
Used to have weed, now they say the bottom got dope
Knew a nigga had soap, and they rocked his ass
Saw they did a round hit, and they stopped his ass
Million dollar nigga, they call him socks in the air
They don’t play around anigga, they got Glocks over there
Rest in peace to Lil [?], he was just in the way
When them bullets from up top, man they started to spray
It’s just another story from around the way
Where we keep a tough crew and them boys don’t play
75 nigga ball, rest in peace to bubble
I like my remmy and my rose, bud is [?]
Keep winning, and keep on losing
You keep on hating and your bitch keep choosing
You think she ain’t?
Motherfucker we got bottles sitting everywhere
Ain’t too many niggas models sitting everywhere

When I say weakass, you say bitch
Weakass bitch, weakass bitch
I don't want no basic bitches, basic bitches
I don't want no basic bitches, wait a minute motherfucker

[Hook: Meek Mill]
White niggas be talkin' hard
Talkin' shit till we pull your card
Take your chain, beat you up
Fuck your bitch, clean you up
My niggas wylin', we wylin' wylin'
My niggas wylin', we be wylin', we wylin' wylin'
My niggas wylin', we be wylin' we wylin', wylin'
My niggas wylin'
And I don't want no basic bitches

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
She ain't never fuck with a rich nigga
She told me that her ex was a bitch nigga
So I told her put me on the 'Gram though
Just to flex on that nigga with some real killers
And now he on my line talkin' reckless
I'm thinkin', should I slide or should I check him?
But I ain't goin' to war bout no pussy though
But if you tryna you get wet then
Runnin' with my niggas on the low-low
We in the south side, talkin' mafioso
I be really outside, bustin' with my four-four
Right there on the south side, watching for the po-po
Sharper than a motherfucker
We gettin' money like a motherfucker
She suckin' dick for Red Bottoms
You bet some bitches call 'em bloodsuckers
Get it?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Quavo]
I know exactly what Meek talkin' bout
I took your basic ass ho and then I nut on her mouth
Broke niggas you can stand to the left
Rich niggas to the right with their pistols out
Playin' with a cat, got her whiskers out
Got 'Rari's and Bentleys, and Fiskers out
Hold up, what the fuck this nigga talkin' bout?
Yo, Takeoff, pull the Mac-11 out
Young niggas wylin', 12 o'clock on a Friday
Pull up like Big Worm, I want my money Friday
And you can have your basic bitches
Because my hoes' siddity with fat ass and titties

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Takeoff, I make the work disappear like a magician
Take that envy then stand in the kitchen, whip me up a chicken
I beat that pot like a chemist, money bat-bat like it's tennis
And free my niggas in penitentiaries, they locked in the system
I pray the Lord is my witness, nigga, I'm stackin' them benjis
Ever since they killed Pistol Pete my nigga, I turned to a menace
And all these diamonds around my neck, I put on two of them chinchillas
Drop my top in the winter, cash out at the Beverly Center
Go to my jeweler out in Cuba, get diamonds below temperature
Double cup my muddy trouble, I'm an Actavis citizen
Bitches run around the lobby, boot 'em up, but no Timberlands
Your bitch pull up to my trap with no car
Like football she get penalties

[Hook][Hook: Kid Ink]
Everybody follow me back home
It's a after party full of bad hoes
Bunch of drink, grass smoke
You can do them other drugs in the bathroom
Follow me, back home
It's a after party full of bad hoes
Bunch of drink, grass smoke
You can do them other drugs in the bathroom

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Cause I'm tryna keep it on the low girl
Breezy, and I'm living in a cold world
Tryna get in, gotta know the code word
And I'll take one, but girl you gotta go first
Whole room moving like a lava lamp
Club full of bad girls, no oxygen
And you know it's going down, Nasdaq
Kobe on the blunt, you gotta pass that
We don't smoke those, you can ash that
I'm in the bathroom hiding from Kat Stacks
Drove here, but I'mma need a cab back
I got my money right, since you comparing that

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
Yeah, I got they hands up, like a classroom
Can't see me like I got a mask on
Girls straight off the cover of Maxim
It's snow bunnies here, like we in Alaska
White girls, dyke girls
And she told you that she don't even like girls
Lying ass, I make that kitty purr
Since you can bring it back, go on hit reverse
It ain't no grenades, land mines
Gotta blend in, camouflage
You tripping girl, this ain't a Altoid
But it got me feeling like a cocaine cowboy

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Gudda Gudda]
Yeah, money on my mind, what the fuck should I be thinking 'bout?
Purple drank and two Styrofoams is what I'm drinking out
The party's popping, as well as pills, I'm geeked bitch
The whole damn party's outta control, I'm in the bathroom with a freak bitch
Gudda ho, yeah that's my name, don't look at me, look at my chain
Walk in the party, shut down the party then pile the hoes in the black Range
All black tires, I'm the Batman
In the Batmobile, doors up, bat wings
I get a lot of money, what are you doing?
The hoes think I'm crazy, couple screws loose and
I party hard, we ain't sleeping 'til next afternoon
So follow me and swallow me it's a party in the bathroom

[Intro]:

Baby, Baby, Baby
You better believe this
Baby

[SteeZy]:

That's what these things look like
All 24k gold and they all look nice
Flow so cold in this winter night
Heat it up then I'm taking flight
Waiting for my summer grind
Po' a deuce in my lemon-lime
Add a jolly, bitches wild at the party
Lolly lolly she know how to work her body
On them mollies – call er' Molly Poppins
She keep it dropping, Never stopping
Not an option, like my breaks missin'
Take a break and get lifted
Rally, rally Youse' a bitch kid
Smack Sally if he dissin'
Pop the lid and start ignition
Burning gas, got my thoughts drifted
Smash the pedal, on another level
Hit the treble, hit the bass, hit the bump
Man you know my speakers thump
S T double double E Z Y
That's the fly guy stunting right into the sky
Blunted feeling stupid high
I ain't coming down
I ain't clowning around
'Bout the sound, not the noise
And your boys are unbalanced
No swag, no poise
Bitch

[Hook]:

Boyz on the grind
Boyz on the grind
We just Boyz on the grind
Tryna' get it on time
We don't bullshit or worry
Pass that in a hurry
And if the police come then we out in a scurry

[Trob]:

I am sippin' from the fountain of youth
Catch me in a Bentley coupe
Scoop scooping' up a bitch or two
I ain't even look at you to see the honest truth
Through your lies, through your eyes and you know that I ain't ever gonna die
Die, die...
Here comes Sally

[Sally]:

Yeah I got a big dick
Bitches think I'm so sick
Coming right at you
All I say is "ah chu."
Rawest rapper in this game
Blasting off, I got that fame
Making green on the reg
Bitch cross me I'll cut'chyo leg
Fuckin' up hoes on GTA
Don't forget that Johnathan's gay
T-Rob making raw beats
Fuckin' yo bitch between them sheets
Sippin' on 40's, not my style
Try to force me you'll hit that tile
Orange Crush, my kinda drank
Damn Steez, this green is dank
Logging onto Reddit, looking at kitties
Shit fuck ass titties

Them niggas talking reckless I get them gunned down
Choppa style goons lurking when the sun down
Niggas throwing bullets trying to get a touchdown
You catch them like Fitzgerald nigga when that clip spill

Beat their appeal make it home then get killed
Cause shit real nigga up in Philadel
I wet you and leave a hole in your head like killer whale
Free Willy and Meek Milly
He really bout that ask a nigga vouch that
Pussy nigga softer than a pillow top mattress
Rappers actors like Samuel L. Jackson
Niggas throwing money, they don't even own a crib yet
And they ain't send no money to their niggas doing the bid yet
You ain't even buy that Playstation for your kids yet
But you making it rain you a fucking lame

[Hook: Meek Mill]
I got a bullet with ya name on it
Catch you slipping sunny day come and rain on it
Niggas talking that shit 'til we slide up on them start sparking that shit
You get a concrete pillow in the coffin for your bed
I have niggas looking for you like there's money on your head
I'ma kill you when I catch you I'ma kill you ya

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
I hear them pussies talking
They talking reckless about me
But when I see them niggas I going to catch some wreck a body
I'm talking shots fired, got a man down
Coppers walkie talkie, over stand down
Shots still shooting choppers still chopping
I ain't trap in like a year but the block still popping
Niggas hating on me they don't got an option
Cause I'm shining perfect timing
Like a diamond VVS shit
Niggas can't fuck with me I'm like their ex bitch
I'm on that homicide ride or die x shit
44 revolver wild wild west shit
Niggas talking reckless now they on my wreck list
Death wish bullets hit your front back exit
Ya hollow heads just to bobble heads
And if we spot him there then we drop him there

[Hook: Meek Mill]

[Verse 3: Manny Wellz]
Many many men [?]
But fuck a vest I keep a tec up on me
Fuck his chest I hit his head hit his face and hit his neck when I squeeze
[?] fuck it
Look we really do this here
We all shooters here
Thirty rounds in that four pound Ruger ya
Come through here like you gon' talk shit out
You won't be walking out you be walking down
Bullets pounding from front to rear
Doctors yelling clear and the nigga flatline
He been dead shots hit his chest came out his backside
We murder and snatch guys
Take them to their stash spot
Search the premises until some money holler jackpot
I'm on my own, thirty shots in the clip of my chrome
I'm on your top little niggas is on
I know some real live street niggas I can hit on the phone
And get you shot broad day in your dome

[Hook: Meek Mill][Verse 1: Meek Mill & Big Sean]

[Meek Mill]
Chain all V.S. I ain't with the B.S
Catch me in your city riding hard through the B.X
Skinny nigga but I do it large like a 3X
The last nigga tried to do me wrong umm he checked
Right back to that money slinging O's in the p-jects
Or prolly catchin mileage while the pilot steer the P-Jet
Cause we next and we flex like

[Big Sean]
90PX, working all night no breaks or a recess
Vroom vroom yeah I know my car sound like a T-Rex
Bitch, I'm 23 years old and I ain't riding in a Prius
My cousin finished school can't believe he graduated
Threw him 20,000 dollars told his ass congratulations
Cause me... I wasn't made for that shit
But I could probably hire him and who all paid for his shit
And to all the hoes that was dissin' I pray to God that you see me
I'm on a yacht getting hella' high smoking good that seaweed
Bad bitch in her cha-cha grabbing on her chi-chi's
Million dollar deals on my email you mad as hell you ain't CC'ed
Chain all V.S. bitch you knows it's B.S. boy I run my city

[Meek Mill]
End of story, nigga P.S
All white Maybach, Green Bay they packing
Y'all niggas was slackin' 'member the hard nights we trappin'
And they say lifes a game of chess you can play checkers all on my jacket
Cause it's Damier and we bombs away on y'all big rappers
I say yeah nigga I murder that Panamera turtle back
Niggas say they want beef, well where the fuck is my burger at?
I got white, was serving that -- I been to jail, I ain't going back
I alley oop your bitch off that backboard she throw it back
I slam dunk in that pussy, Blake Griffin'd yo ho, nigga
Maybach with Ricky Ross my chain rock like I know Jigga
That's cause I do ho, shout out to my new ho
That pussy pink like Nuvo and I dog that Cujo

[Hook: Big Sean & Meek Mill]

[Big Sean]
Niggas wanna talk what they gon' say (gon' say)
I hit the pedal til that motherfucker break (til it break)
Freaky bitches love the money I make
And to live like this you motherfuckers gotta pay
So let that shit burn

[Meek Mill]
Let that shit burn I'mma let that shit burn let that shit burn (burn, gasoline)
The roof on fire I'm only gettin' higher
50 racks all in my pocket I want bottles I'mma let that shit burn

[Verse 2: Big Sean & Meek Mill]

[Big Sean]
Bitch, I had one shot and I ain't blow it
Riding til the wheels fall off and they tow it
I got green on top of green damn its looking like I grow it
D-Town the hood behind me like a king cobra

[Meek Mill]
Burn bitch I let it burn bitch
My money straighter than a motherfucking perm bitch
No navigation you can see it is my turn shit (swirv, swirv)
Shorty give me all that brain still ain't never learned shit

[Big Sean]
Oh that's your girl? Damn nigga you ain't learn shit
She naked in my studio I'm on that Howard Stern shit
I swear that mac 10 is my barbell, Finally Famous the cartel
Hit your girl in my whip and now that pussy got the new car smell
Same shit different day I ain't broke no more it's a different day
Don't turn me down I got shit to say my purp strong like it's lifting weights
It's Sean Don sippin' Chandon I got a bad bitch with them pom pom's
My Rollie don't tick-tock your shit sound like a time bomb, boom...lil' bitch

[Hook][Intro]
I'm the God, I'm God
This' for the hood
P.A.P. nigga

[Verse]
Lames getting me vex, bang off the reflex
Drown in the streets, I ain't see a good key yet
Holes in his white tee shoot him in his V neck
Bring drama to your door step UPS
Bullets hit the chamber and the shells hit the seaman
Make a nigga do the Harlem shake like G. Dep
Cause we dress the impress yes, they know we fresh
Man they er'thing got no class went to recess
Bang bang, stand now how my actions never regret
My homeboy used to fish tell me in the GS
My man putting work can't believe he hesitated
Took the gun out of his hand, told him ain't thug-educated
Cause me, I would've aired that shit
Ask the boys in your hood how I clear that strip
And to all the lames that be dissing, you pray to God that you don't see me
I'm a big ass on front street in HD and 3D
Mac a zombie and Benjamins, you get Washingtons like DC
Can't saboutage my catalogue so I laugh at y'all like he he
Lame you a reject, he gon' need 3 vests
Boy I run the city pop the clip when they eject
Blunt homies berreting crispy getting they crack in
Blow your money while you stack in, man now put the man in Manhattan
They say life is short but I bet you, you can play Russian roulette with my ratchet
Cause it's Smith and Wesson, I hit perfections and get this ratch in these rappers
I say Thug-A, you heard of that, of course we heard of that
Take one of the after go do the chucks, we're off your bush you murder back
1.5 I tuck that put it in a hole like fold rap
Throw for your man down he raining, he should've sworn back
I hooked on that nigga, may weather that lame
Getting money trigger happy papi, I stressed up I got know slake
That's because I do ho, more shells than Neuro
My move's pretty meditated I planned it, Pluto

[Hook]
You wanna talk, or you wanna play
I be laughing at these lames er'day
Boss on sale weed booyay
When you see 'em in the streets
They ain't moving what they say
Man these niggas is burns
Man these niggas is burns
Man these niggas is burns
Man these niggas is burns
They say they on fire walking on with wires
They ain't nothing but some liars
I'm a sayan man, these niggas is burnsLarger than live, call me Andre the Giant
You faggots feeling bad, but I'm feeling so fine
You bitches gonna talk, what you gonna say?
Heard your team got nothing on me or Swizz (beatz)

Fancy car dress-down at Emirati
Devil on my clutch, call him red big party
You faggots still talking huh, I thought you came late
But since we talking time, all you pussies gotta wait

Thats black bag in lac, thats horsepower in bags
40 killa listen you better slow down that rap
Fly out Dubai, in a G6 thats holds everybody in the cock
Cause we all wanna fly

What this all p.s?
Writing letters G.S
Guards all down cause my teams on recess
Bitches still talk, what they gonna bitch?

Big wheels on the ground and that fresh-auto kit

50 steps here till I make that ladder fall (3)
Make that ladder (2)
50 steps here till I make that ladder fall (3)
Make that ladder (2)

What you talking pey? (4)[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I'm right back in the mix
Rose bottle care
Ain't no stalking in this bitch
We're balling in this bitch
The seven be the whip
I'm heavy on the wrist
We came to have some fun
So keep your hands over your bitch
In the V.I.P look crazy
Haters with the shady
Pockets full of money
Is the way that you can lay me
And the DJ start to play me
Everybody going crazy
My whole crew got on Gucci's
Their neck full of jewelries

[Hook]
If you say you getting money let me see you
Call it out, call it out, call it out
If you're buying, all the bottles make you call it
Call it out, call it out, call it out
If them haters lookin' at you cause you're balling
Call it out, call it out, call it out
You're getting money and you said you're never falling
Call it out, call it out, call it out

[Verse 2]
Whole black panorama
Smiling for the camera
I only do a step
Cause I'm really not a dancer
I might just do a lean
I might be on that lean
We're bailing in that scene
To you it's just a dream
You can never get this money
Never throw these twenties
Never cop these bottles
And never fuck these models
See this AP on my wrist
Make a nigga sick
I cop all the Ciroc
And treat it like it's ?
I ain't playing around with you haters
I'm known for getting this paper
I'm buying the bar all night
And fucking a bitch tonight
I'm up for moving the white
This the way I'm living my life
My diamonds blue like a light
When I cop a car I cop it twice
I turn your bitch to a dime
Cause you ain't fucking her right
She ain't making it to home tonight
Keep going to beat your wife (huh)
I guess that's why these other niggas hating on me
I ain't tripping cause my whole crew waiting on me

[Hook][Intro]
Bay bay wussup mane?
Wuddup Juicy?
Wiz wussup?
Project Pat wussup?
Taylor Gang in this bitch

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
We're pourin' drinks in the club, smell the weed when we coming in
We ain't worried bout the game cus we running it
Got a joint, with a bottle in my other hand
Bitches love me, niggas hatin' on me cus I got cash in a rubberband
I got cash in a rubberband
I got cash in a rubberband
I got cash in a rubberband

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Commas after commas, if it's money I'm comin'
I got bands, mister drummin' fuck the hoes that you lovin'
Designers that's nothing, private jet, man thats stuntin'
You never did this shit so my niggas start frontin'
Last lady with me, she ain't even legal
I let er drive the Benz cuz she match my ego
Derek Jeter set, Im ballin' like rollin'
Catchin' wind with the top down, I feel like Im ballin'
Money don't bend, zeros don't end
All this money that Im stackin' in, I done setting a trend
Still owning that real shit, you rap niggas are gon' kill shit
Hunned bands, throw it in the club
Don't give a shit cus I'm still rich

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Project Pat]
I got 20,000 ones in my britches-s-s
Im'ma fuck the throw, all this only bitches is
You niggas life savin', one night you spending this
Shawty ass killin, she ain't leavin' no witnesses
We throwin' money all night, we ain't running now
On my Juicy J swag nigga and I'm showin 'out
Molly in yo girl ass and my dick in her mouth
If she dont finish all her food I ain't pullin' out
Rubberband bang bro, choppas that a blow a ho
Bigger than a hoola hoop through your residential door
Blowin' presidential smoke
This that Cali buzz
Man plus we makin' G's and getting our dicks sucked

[Hook]Uhh... check it out
You need to get your snowboots on
And put on your big puffy jackets
Go turn the heater on
It's gonna get real cold
Frosty Takeovers

Freezo

Ill be spitting verses 'til I'm six feet
It gets deep
Turning instrumentals in to mince meat
Trap rapper hipster conscience back packer miss me
With labels I just spit heat

Like a circus acts
The worse is back
And never left
This God never rest
Send the message like the deity that make birkin bags

Take a minute to digest that type of simile
Make your mother hyperventilate she
Never heard a spitter quite as sick as me
Sniffle sniffle peep the imagery
Of one verse
Equal fifty sneezes
Mix with the symptoms seen in a
Leper and lupus
I brew a ill symphony
Leave my competition dead like chivalry (simple shit)

Shmoney dancing with some flys, boy, I been the shit
I'm one of a kind,you're like titties on the internet
I roll up a dime getting lifted with the syndicate
Spit some intricate writtens
Been as frigid as the winter gets

In my city
Chi city
Know that they vibe with me
Maybe so much they'll high five Willy
Or probably
Realise he got no friends and talks in third person
But if you did this beat you had a worse verse
Than freezo
Please bro

He's one cold cracker
Any other rappers no factor
The flows fatter than the whole cast of
Biggest loser. When the booth is occupied by me
I lose my fucking mind bold laughter
For whoever goes after

Been the best with writtens but I freestyle
Make any able-minded person feel senile
I'll see trial
In heaven God will dap me up like see child
You speak wild on anything you touched
Best believe I'll

Get you in
No simpleton
Will get it when they're listening
To anything I've laid after gripping pen
The visions been too potent too focus
You know that the flow is soul crippling
Game ready even though it's just conditioning


They got me in my bully yo
Every beat resting in paradise like Coolio
Bet I'mma dead it every time that I'm in the studio
My duty to run through these instrumentals
Guessing you should know
I'm chillin'
