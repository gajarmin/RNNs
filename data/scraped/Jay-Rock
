[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Me and my niggas tryna git it, ya bish
Hit the house lick, tell me is you wit' it, ya bish
Home invasion was persuasive
From nine to five I know it's vacant, ya bish
Dreams of living life like rappers do
Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool
I fucked Sherane and went to tell my bros
Then Usher Raymond "Let It Burn" came on
Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen, ya bish
Park the car then we start rhyming, ya bish
The only thing we had to free our mind
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs
You looking like an easy come up, ya bish
A silver spoon I know you come from, ya bish
And that's a lifestyle that we never knew
Go at a reverend for the revenue

[Hook]
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doing
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun, forever)
And I been hustling all day, this-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade and that's just how I feel
Nah, nah, a dollar might just fuck your main bitch, that's just how I feel
Nah, a dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with, that's just how I feel
Nah, nah, a dollar might just make that lane switch, that's just how I feel
Nah, a dollar might turn to a million and we all rich, that's just how I feel

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Dreams of living life like rappers do
Bump that new E-40 after school
You know big balling with my homies
Earl Stevens had us thinking rational
Back to reality, we poor, ya bish
Another casualty of war, ya bish
Two bullets in my Uncle Tony head
He said one day I'll be on tour, ya bish
That Louis Burger never be the same
A Louis belt will never ease that pain
But I'mma purchase when that day is jerking
Pull off at Church's with Pirellis skirting
Gang signs out the window, ya bish
Hoping all of them offend you, ya bish
They say your hood is a pot of gold
And we gon' crash it when nobody's home

[Hook]

[Bridge x2: Anna Wise]
Be the last one out to get this dough, no way
Love one of you bucket headed hoes, no way
Hit the streets then we break the code, no way
Hit the brakes when they on patrol, no way

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
Imagine Rock up in them projects
Where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus don't miss them stockings
Liquor spillin', pistols popping
Baking soda YOLA whipping
Ain't no turkey on Thanksgiving
My homeboy just domed a nigga
I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue
Every day I'm hustlin'
What else is a thug to do
When you eatin' cheese from the government
Gotta provide for my daughter n'em
Get the fuck up out my way, bish
Got that drum and I got them bands
Just like a parade, bish
Drop that work up in the bushes
Hope them boys don't see my stash
If they do, tell the truth
This the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass ain't cut
Them serpents lurking, blood
Bitches selling pussy, niggas selling drugs, but it's all good
Broken promises, steal your watch and tell you what time it is
Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a FootLocker is
In the streets with a heater under my Dungarees
Dreams of me getting shaded under a money tree

[Hook]

[Outro]
K’s Mom: Kendrick, just bring my car back man. I called in for another appointment. I figured you weren’t gonna be back here on time anyways. Look, shit, shit, I just wanna get out the house man. This man, on one, he feeling good as a mother fucker. Shit, I’m trynna get my thing going too. Just bring my car back. Shit, he faded. He feeling good. Look, listen to him
K’s Dad: Girl, Girl, I want your body, I want your body, cause of that big ol’ fat ass. Girl, Girl, I want your body, I want your body, cause of that big ol’ fat ass
K’s Mom: See he high as hell, and he ain’t even tripping off them damn dominoes anymore. Just bring the car back
K’s Dad: Did somebody say dominoes?[Hook]
I told my niggas if you hold me back
From pursuin', ain't no comin' back
We gon' catch these Gs, now watch me do just that
Make these monies easy and watched 'em grew in fact
I told my niggas if you hold me back
From pursuin', ain't no comin' back
Pick your poison, tell me what you do with that
Make these monies easy and watch 'em grew in packs
I told my niggas if you hold me back

[Verse 1]
Uh, imagine Rock up in that field where options ain't so audible
Problems steady fallin', the effects is like some dominoes
Issues chronological, gotta get that money fast
Andale, vamonos, feelin' like Osama, got my llama close
Hope them boys don't come knock at my mama's door
AK-47 out that window, think I'm paranoid
America, another case I can't afford, help me Lord

[Hook]
I told my niggas if you hold me back
From pursuin', ain't no comin' back
We gon' catch these Gs, now watch me do just that
Make these monies easy and watched 'em grew in fact
I told my niggas if you hold me back
From pursuin', ain't no comin' back
Pick your poison, tell me what you do with that
Make these monies easy and watch 'em grew in packs
I told my niggas if you hold me back

[Verse 2]
Been about that money, fuck the damn lotto
Cruisin' through the 'jects wit' the 12 shotta
Most my niggas gone or the jail got em'
And most these bitches wrong but we still jock em'
Cocaine in the trap, still rockin'
Them hood rats in the back got that trim poppin'
She twerkin' for the camera while her kids watchin'
And she gon' take that cheese to go wig shoppin'
That's if she owe me that, go check my zodiac
Have many coke and cognac in that culdesac
My uncle Bobby had them bodies, he wore the mac
Ain't talking oldies when its singin' that 40 clap
Can't nobody hold me back, I'mma locomotive steam rollin'
Gotta fight to keep that money stream open
Liquor shots is for your team, that's tree smokin'
In that coupe de ville with D's on it

[Hook]
I told my niggas if you hold me back
From pursuin', ain't no comin' back
We gon' catch these Gs, now watch me do just that
Make these monies easy and watched 'em grew in fact
I told my niggas if you hold me back
From pursuin', ain't no comin' back
Pick your poison, tell me what you do with that
Make these monies easy and watch 'em grew in packs
I told my niggas if you hold me back

[Verse 3]
Gotta get it ain't no options out here
Her nigga just killed my partner out here
They wonder why we steady glockin' out here
Cuz niggas they ain't really lockin' out here
And we ain't worried 'bout them coppers out here
Do anything to try to stop us out here
No 9-to-5's but we clockin' out here
Every chance they get you know they watch us out here
Oh yeah, got to be that animal
Streets is like a jungle it'll eat you like its Hannibal
Wigs splitted, cantaloupe, yeah we see that everyday
Candles lit, pour out liquor, hope it take the pain away
I ain't tryna play my way, I'm just tryna pave my way
Mama tell me gotta save them pennies for them rainy days
Have me snatch that switch, off that branch with some leaves on it
Fantasizin' bout some money trees on em'

[Hook]
I told my niggas if you hold me back
From pursuin', ain't no comin' back
We gon' catch these Gs, now watch me do just that
Make these monies easy and watched 'em grew in fact
I told my niggas if you hold me back
From pursuin', ain't no comin' back
Pick your poison, tell me what you do with that
Make these monies easy and watch 'em grew in packs
I told my niggas if you hold me back

[Outro]
Yeah, on this journey we call life, its always gonna be obstacles, road blocks, things tryna hold you back. Just keep pushin, don't let that stop you. Never give up, stay chasin' money trees. Don't let nobody tell you you can't do it. Keep going, nahmean?
Don't let nobody stop you, I mean nobody. Uh huh, go hard for what you believe in. Stay up, wake up, cake up, get paper, and I swear to God things will fall in your favor[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I fucked up the rap game and you ain't even know it
I just fucked what's her name and you ain't even know it
She got a *censored* tattoo and you ain't even know it
We about to form a little groupie and you ain't even know it, let's get it
Stuck in a rock and a hard place
Eminem, Pac and where God stay
Timberlands pop that jaw bone
Now bitch nigga, tell me how that tar taste
And even Tarzan can get swung on
I never hung out with the loud mouth
You got a foul mouth
And that dead body gon' smell foul when it fouls out
She filed my nails in the Bahamas
We found ourselves in the Bahamas
She found God, meditation and peace
I found myself without a condom
You know everybody having them babies
It's a beautiful thing it ain't crazy
If a rapper monogamous, you know what the problem is?
Too many bitches got rabies
And I hate a ho-hoppin' woman
Stank pussy-poppin' woman
You fuckin' fool don't know about you
But my dick need 70 years on it
Anything after that is just a bonus
And I been in the lab with my opponents
And since Sway done swayed that list
He got a flatscreen the next morning
Tell 'em I need my credit when it's due
Tell 'em I need my lettuce when it's new
Tell 'em I got a fetish for fine fabric Franklins and saying, "Fuck you"
Tell 'em it's TDE 'til I'm DDT'd in that grave
And Top Dawg is proof
'til my nigga Whoo Kid get free, ain't shit comin' for free
I'm 'bout to rape you niggas 'til you recoup
(Dizzle)

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
It's a groovy nigga, that's all day, Backwood hold three grams
Got a six-shooter, that revolver spinning, shell stuck inside, but won't jam
This hoody here about two stacks, hell yeah that bitch could gon' go ham
Molly in her drink, but she asked me to and oh yeah I got this on cam
Gangsta nigga, no trap beats, bet I still sound like that new shit
Originality in my blueprint, still Figg side, Figuero pimp
Her big ass where my palm hit, pull my dick out, she gon' balm it
Swag surfin' all through the world, slide through the sea on a comet
O-X-Y for these morons, that be that new shit I'm pushin'
Raise off of them pockets, bring more of them coffins
These niggas ain't popping, tell them old niggas to move on
Aw damn I done said it, all them can beheaded

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
She ain't single but she solo, you ain't even know it
Unsigned with sold out shows, you ain't even know it
My lips black but they ain’t chapped, she ain’t even know that
Let’s have sex, she said, "Yes", you know she ain’t "no" that
Seed of life on my chest, my head next to her breast
My mind all in the clouds, just bought an ounce of the best
No talking when I’m off that loud
I came quick so she pissed
You know I’m good for another round
But it’s hard when everybody on your dick
Know real niggas that’s crips, I know real niggas that’s bloods
Know real niggas that’s thugging like you ain’t know what’s up
Got codeine in my cup, got a couple checks that need cashing
And you could take that to the bank, what’s life without a balance?
You ain't even know it, nigga I be everywhere you ain’t even going
I thought it was snowing, but I’m just the coldest nigga out here flowin'
Sick of all that bullshit y’all been promoting, but
Carson in the motherfucking house
Del Amo, watch your motherfucking mouth
I took the game by storm, just to X men out
I'm crazy out my mind, I put my life on the line
The tortoise only makes progress when his neck sticks out
Just a little token of gold if you ain't know it, though

[Verse 4: Jay Rock]
Respect, I get the utmost
I'm so dope I'm a walking kilo
36 Os, you don't even know I'm gettin' cheese like Cheetos
You mad that we BMFing, bitch-ass niggas steady PMSing
I never show my hands, can't know my plans
Gotta keep them guessing
Rock, I was off the scene
Now a nigga back like a four and a half
Shooting up the set like Spielberg
See the big picture when them hammers flash
I don't post a lot on Instagram
That's the quickest way they'll get you man
Leave that shit for the bitches man
Alphabet boys, they'll get your ass
IRS, they was on a nigga
Cashed them out, not I'm scot-free
Got my passport in my JanSport, now I'm overseas
You don't even know it
Rock been killin' this shit, no gloves, no mask on me
Just 100 thousand cash on me
Back then, I was doing bad, homie
All my bitches bad now
My old hoes try to keep tabs on me
Safe to say I'm the man now
Fuck ass nigga just stand down
'Fore the shots go up and it's man down
Hands down, still popping
No prescription, I'm flexing
Suplex a pussy, I've been off the edge
Too late to push me, nigga I ain't fell off
Used to move Frosted Flakes like Kellogg's
Pull up to the bank, count paper like tellers
Top Dawg, Money Gang, bitch, we've been on
Clothesline the beat, nigga, John Cena
Been having stripes, can't walk in my Adidas
Kicked in the door, hand on the Nina
Black Hippy shit, rock gon' bleed 'em

[Outro: Future]
I’m turned up every day, you don’t even know it
Got your bitch with me right now, you don’t even know it
We turn up in the club, you don’t even know it
Got a hundred bottles comin’, you don’t even know it
We came up from nothin’, you don’t even know it
Drive a half a million dollar car, you don’t even know it
This a thousand dollar pair of shoes, you don’t even know it
Got a bitch that speak no English, she don’t even know it
This a thousand dollar pair of shoes, you don't even know it
This a thousand dollar cup of lean, you don't even know it
This a half a million dollar car, you don't even know it
I came up from the bottom, you don't even know it
My niggas all ride with me on, you don't even know it
Got killers with me right now, you don't even know it
This a million dollar watch nigga, you don't even know it
Got a million dollar crib nigga, you don't even know it[Produced by Havoc]

[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
Most of these niggas shouldn't be next to us
We keep our distance from those, those acting like hoes
Zany imposed, weed in my clothes, cubics is gold
Your wig'll get told, put the realest niggas
Niggas, product of cap pillers, gangbangers, and dealers
Streets keep watching, aye, click boom the ghetto bird get shot down
Straight to the top now, they want a third strike on my background
But nah homie, put the mask on when I slide on 'em
Put the cash in the safe and here's a extra slug 'fore I shake
You smoke faster than me with a eighth
Or better yet a wet break on a plate
Burning your faith, all your senses covered in tape
Fuckin' with them boys in blue, chill out before I send them rags at you
You running to the cops saying, "How we do?"
Saying it's just rap and them lines ain't true
So I just do Q, fuck it, a ménage à two, or maybe trois
Baby girl need a papa, I be her dada
Coochie smacking, give praise to Allah
Get blazed in my car, with Oxymoron, Rock

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Rock got it, Rock came from rock bottom
Sparked the flames, still remain as a top shotta
I ain't no backpack rapper, I ain't no lyricist
And if we ain't talking to you, mind your business then
Cold with it, Black Hippy, yeah, we cold niggas
All the girlies love us, get a whiff of us
They bones quiver, heard some clown throwing stones at us
Holding boulders champ once you hear that "YAWK," watching domes shatter
It's Top Dawg we runnin' rap, whack rappers, feline
Reason why we don't run with cats
Nine double O five nine, where my family at
Pull up in that family van holding tools like the handyman
And to be real not with all this rapping politickin'
Rapper competition, wrapped up my position
'Til I'm finished, 'til I make a couple tickets
Then I'm outtie on them islands with my crimmies chillin'
Hide your feelings, now can I live?
Look I gotta keep my feet on top of the dirt
Cause everywhere I go they like "When you dropping some work?"
Been a threat since birth
The rap game's pallbearer when I'm droppin' the hearse
I ain't new to this, I'm true to this
Industry's nightmare, red strings in my Nike Airs
Yeah, the white pair, I'm Jay Rock, America's most wanted
My charges? Killing MC's without warning
Rock!

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
It's Ab-Soul, gimme the loot, I'm the skinny Biggie
In New York City with Puffy, puffing a sticky
All odds against me, still even the score
Probably why I'm always OT on tour
TDE, believe me we want war
I don't even know what piece I like most no more
Two fingers, two triggers, what's the difference?
We all gon' die one day, until then I'm gettin' paid
My grandma watching so I ain't gon' curse
Still gifted like a Wale verse, backwood full of OG
Bobby Johnson medicine in my soul to trynna dodge the coffin
And these days are so bittersweet
I guess it's just a balance we battle naturally
And y'all still trippin' off of Jay-Z tweets
I still got laps to run when me and Jay-Z meet
Peep, Soul brother number two
The first one used to make beats for CL Smooth
Top got the S550 but the CL smooth
And rolling weed is the only time I see L's move
Soul!

[Verse 4: Isaiah Rashad]
I think I found my second home
Sunny California and it's your little nigga brother
You ain't meant for corners, it's what they told me
So I never looked back, I got a shell in the bag
Fat as elephant ass, so we flirt in the path
Passing propellers I tell her, tell her we flying just listen
See we diamond just shining and they gon' find us glistening
Brought sand to the beach and we left with your bitch
For the record in Guinness I'm a hecklin' menace
Where is Robin, I'm Given', fuckin' minding my business
He a regular victim, of some regular in women
Regular niggas, you always cater to sluts
You always wasting my time, you always faking the funk
I put your motherfuckin' dream in your face
You keep lookin' for some women to be all in your face
That deep dussy reach niggas, keep dussy
That Tennessee dussy make a nigga be dussy
You can never rap better than me, cause you ain't dedicated
You ain't underrated, you ain't  underlooked
You ain't overbooked, you just undercooked
It's supposed to be me and my niggas in the record book
Now they got me out here by myself still fresh as fuck

[Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar]
I hate y'all, I'd do anything to replace y'all, shout out to Face Mob
A ghetto boy 'til I'm unemployed with a day job
And kicking boxes, I kick ass and then kick knowledge
I'm way more polished than 99% of the scholars you thought had graduated
I'm the master that masturbated on your favorite emcee
Until the industry had wanted me assassinated
You either corny or an opportunist
I let you eat, now go back to church and steal crackers at communion
What I been doing? I'm about to crack the Da Vinci Code
Yeah, and nothing's been the same since they dropped Control
And tucked a sensitive rapper back in his pajama clothes
Ha-ha, joke's on you, high-five
I'm bulletproof, your shots'll never penetrate
Pin a tail on a donkey, boy, you been a fake
I got my thumb on Hip Hop, and my foot in the back of your ass
Aftermath get the last laugh
I serve niggas like master Geoffrey
Jump on the curb, turn a shotty to a verb if you let me
You know I'm a killer, I'm on your head, you know I'm a killer
The West Coast Cosa Nostra under oath 'til it's over
You over owe us, so what the fuck?
I fuck you niggas up, I fuck you niggas up, she suck and fuck
I fuckin' duck you fuckin' niggas like when I want
You go at us, you going fuckin' nuts
Acting irrational, pop you then pop an Adderall
Know the drill like a lateral, nigga
I'm more Pappy Mason than Pastor Mason
Pacing back and forth, racing my thoughts on embracing Daytons
I spilled blood on my apron cooking this shit up
I feel like some of y'all is hating
Quite frankly your bitch booty should thank me for grabbing it
Turn these hoodrats to actresses, what a magic trick?
Accidents never happen when murder's involved
Emaculate tactics so follow me, if you need me just call on me
I say "Hold up, wait a minute
Your career ain't shit unless you got some Kendrick in it!"
Your pussy ain't shit, ain't no room is left on my dick
Unless you look like Jordin Sparks, make my mark on the clitoris, muah
Hollywood's been good to me, lil' hood nigga used to pawn mom's jewelry
Family jewels big as fuck and I got the balls to say it
Balls deep, ballin' out 'til Spalding need a replacement
I'm outchea, the West in your mouth, chea
Invest in the vests of Vietnam vets when you out near
The white court building spilling its Merlot
Fillin' women, a Virgo, pimp the industry
Remember these Stacy Adams and furcoats
Shook, you're scared to death, you're scared to look
In the mirror when Kendrick is near you
King, Kendrick[Produced by DJ Mustard]

[Hook: YG]
Mama ain't raised no fool
Daddy told me never leave the house without my tool
Grandpa told me never trust a sucka nigga from the street
Grandma said she love me and she always praying for me
But I just wanna party, I don’t wanna hurt nobody
I just wanna party, I don't wanna hurt nobody
I just wanna party, I don't wanna hurt nobody
But I’ll beat the fuck out of a nigga, why you bullshittin'?

[Verse 1: YG]
I'm drunk off Hennessy, hope I don't run into my enemies
That dark liquor give you energy
Now I ain't rich, but I'm finna be
Your baby mama's a flip, she wanna hit a G
(Ahhh shit!) I'm back on that bool shit
But she ain't fuckin' and that's bullshit
I can't die, I got too much to live for
I'm getting money, that's what niggas rob and kill for
Fucking with Tenisha and Keisha
But when Keisha see Tenisha she gon' whoop her ass
All my homies gangbangers
They dry their clothes on hangers
All these hoes fuckin', but they don't wanna seem like a ho
So you gotta hit 'em on the low (hit em' on the D-Low!)
West side, get money gang
Socked the mouth for trippin', he lost his watch and earrings

[Hook]

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Nigga, I'm from Hoover Street, dirty pictures in my cellphone
On 52nd street I'm well-known
Hoover stomp until the cops come
Silver satan get the job done
Money ain't everything, but still I'm rich
Money ain't everything, I'm still gon' crip
From Figueroa to Harv Side where we sock on lips
We break on jaws, niggas since VCR's, nigga
We hop out cars, nigga
I be groovin' 'til I die, smokin' weed until I'm fried
I could sell a key to God
Pants saggin' with the Glock, I ain't wanna pick the box
All my homies gangbangers
We keep a thumb between our two fingers
We trippin' off the Henny
So don't let me catch you slippin' in the 50's, Ricky

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
Nigga, I'm from Bounty Hunters, East Side lunatic
Gang bang, slap a bitch
I ain't with the extras, I ain't got a stunt double
You ain't got no hands so they might let the gun touch you
Is you bangin' or you ballin', nigga?
You a fax machine, we can't call it, nigga
Everybody ain't a friend, reason why I keep a fo'
You wanna gamble with your life, bet that on the ten or four, nigga
She bouncing that ass, go ahead shake it
And if she give me that back, bitch, I'ma break it
Shit, that pussy is overrated, some niggas'll chase it
She acting like she be nuttin', some bitches are fakin'
You fightin', and savin' these hoes, know that you losin'
These bitches the reason why some niggas be snoozin'
YG, dawg, you heard how they left his brains hanging?
Shouldn't have chucked his fingers up if he ain't banging
I'm sayin'...

[Hook]

[Outro]
But I'll beat the fuck out of a bitch
Why you bullshitting?[Produced by J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League]

[Hook: Jay Rock]
Keeping it G ain't nuttin, you ain't gotta like it cause the hood gone love it
You ain't gotta like it cause the hood gone love it
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public
I got the whole block bumpin
You ain't gotta like it cause the hood gone love it
You ain't gotta like it cause the hood gone love it
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Na na na na now now you know what this is
Tell em its a celebration bitches
With the barbeque pits and the mini-bikes
Mini-skirts, Hennessys, and the Miller Lites
Domino tables, who got big 6?
Where I'm from we do concrete backflips
Flip flop flip flop flip flop back
To the ghetto's where I bring hip hop back
Real niggas love me, they tell me keep it pushin
The only niggas speak from way inside Central Bookings
County jails and the lock downs up north
Said I should have it if Scarface pass the torch
Thats how they feel Jack, built much more than rap
This that project haircut in the culdesac
This is where Jose front you them quarters at
Meet your quota whenever I put a quote on a track
Nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
From Compton to Baltimore I'mma kill it
I buy a morgue in the minute
The public house, the plastic couch of a section 8 tenant
The Regal window is tinted
The air conditioner broke but I'm cool enough to ensure you my ride is an Eskimo, huh?
And I peel off in the midst of getting my thrills off
And I thrive off energies from the inner cities that we lost, huh?
I'm putting the ghetto on top of my back
And I live in the back of the jungle
Lions, tigers, bears, oh my
Hear the siren, walk up, (*pow pow*) drive by
Shooters, looters, federal fed intruders
The engines on back of scooters
The real can recognize real and we need to know just who you are
You are in the presence of many presents
Kendrick the gift for the future oh yeah I said it
Thug life, good kid mad city mad respect representin the hub right

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
The home girls tells me I'm the shit
I break them off so they can buy some outfits
I buy them sons a pack of pampers, some new jordans
Give em the game, school em on whats really important
It's how I was raised, the og's had me
13 fresh off the porch, slangin' cavi
But I'm wiser now, show all my young niggas
There's other ways you get them dollars and funds niggas
Coming down in an old school, so cool
Whip like a fire ball call it Goku
You don't know the tribulations that we go through
Put your ears to the speakers I'mma show you
I paint the picture so perfect
In my cd you see Mona Lisa in person
Courtesy of a hunnit beat
Got my crips and esse's at arm reach, one West

[Hook][Produced by Willie B]

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
This what you really want, huh
Turn me up, Ali

[Sample: Donny Hathaway]
I know your image of me
Is what I hope to be

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Black lip bastard, pass me your password
So I can hack inside your brain, see I, too, have gone insane
Before I fall, I'm sure to curse you all in Jesus' name
Lead shower, Anna Peebles hour, bitch, stand the rain

Look inside my parking garage and see a collage
Of every person I despise since the moment I turned five
Calculate my steps and strategically took my time
Even falling off, I land on the ass of Nicki Minaj (So soft)
Eat that pink pussy like it's Friday
Bust one, Roman Reload, then smoke to Sade
And somebody tell Rihanna too
I need that vagina too (Hey baby)
Don't fucking take me for some kind of fool
I'm kinda the reminder of knowing Compton ain't kinda cool
Good kid, mad city, mountaintops couldn't see my views
Countertops, we hop over, hit the register, then we move
I hope this shit can register on a regular soon
Before I climb this pedestal and make you catch my fucking stool, bitch
K.Dot, leave 'em grieving on evening news
Even when society break even, I'll break rules

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
I told niggas, caught wrecked, then I towed niggas
Fold niggas like clothes and drawers, nigga
Homie chose to go toe-to-toe, I had to break his leg
Like a cliché to rock a show, is that over your head?
Niggas stretching the truth like they choose to do yoga instead
Either that or that or they depressed, eating yogurt in bed
Solar system, grab a space shuttle and stay subtle
The bass bit the bait, I'm straight, you a gay couple
I ain't thirsty for the deal, way to make 'em pay double
Anxious when the bacon on the table, I need a muzzle
You're basic like cable to a satellite dish
You was running L.A., now you out of there like Fish
What more can I say? I'm a bastard with black lips
Black shirt, black shades, long black dick
I'm awkward, dog, I'm tryna bargain shop at Saks Fifth
Swung two axes and knocked the Earth off axis' ass

[Verse 3: Schoolboy Q]
Figg side, black nine, black lips, smoke time
Fuck this rap shit, I'm active
Sucking on titties since I was eight
Hoodie with my shades, I ain't tryna be fake
So don't be talking to me, pussy
Running your gums like you be Loc'ing
When the world know that you're nookie
Rookie, softer than infant fabric
I won't have it, when the gun drawn, get rat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tatted
Know my niggas moving
You hesitating to hit the lick, what the fuck is you doing?

[Verse 4: Ab-Soul]
Perpetrating, bitches popping Percocet and percolating
Freelance for God, but do the work of Satan, whatever works
I'm clever with the words, if you haven't noticed yet
Lightyears ahead, I'm bright and I like to get oral sex
Soul brother number 1+1, getting fed like where drugs and guns come from

[Verse 5: Jay Rock]
All we do is do it, shitting on the competition
Taking heads off, this Hannibal Lecter music
You niggas don't move me, you niggas just movies
Cut straight to them credits and hit you wit' a Uzi
Peel off in a dullies, truck bed full of toolies
Get home, smoke, poke on some coochie
I'm just fucking around, enough with them fairy tales
But I bust heads for real, go head
I'm Jay Rock, you lil niggas beneath me
How you gon' dance with the devil with two left feet?
Peep, thinking you sweet, but you weak
Talking out of turn'll leave all of your teeth in the street
Momma taught you better, never clash with a giant
Unless you David, remember, my nigga, I'm not Goliath
Feel the wrath of this titan, hit some water, call it Poseidon
Wig out, then hit your ass with a trident
Money on the table, my nigga, you know I'm all in
If rap was a drink, you wine, nigga, I'm all gin
Hunnit proof, recruit a hunnit troops who love to shoot
No fluke, my nigga, you know that's what us hunters do
East side up, Watt City mayhem
Choppers, they spraying from A.M. to P.M
I'm the silent assassin of the four-headed dragon
Black Hippy blasting a .50 out the back of the Benz Wagon
Toe-tagging wack rappers off G.P
You can't see me, your vision ain't 3D
You smoking on that seaweed, we rolling up that kiwi
In the backwood lighting, we high for like three weeks
You paying for that pussy, but we always get freebies
Top Dawg that ho and throw it like a frisbee, it's history
You know the night and day is ours
Top Dawg conglomerate, Hiii Power, bitch!

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
Is this what y'all really want?
This Black Hippy shit what y'all really want?
When I'm in interviews, don't ask me 'bout no crews
No posses, no cliques, don't tell me who's gettin' it
I don't give a fuck, nigga
I just paid-- I just paid six figures in taxes, nigga
I'm rich daily, on some independent shit
Uncle Sam talking 'bout [?]
I'm like "Nigga, fuck you!"
K-Dot said it, not Kendrick
Ab-Soul got us stuck on the planet, nigga
T.D.E., solar system, Control System, bee-otch![Intro]
Yeah niggas!
Who the fuck you thought it was?
It's ya nigga Jay muthafuckin Rock, top dog!
Before I get started, let me get a rest in peace to my nigga Pac
Gotta go in on this one
Yeah, let's go

[Verse]
Give me my money and stacks and lace my swishas with kush, nigga
Hard liquor fuck up my liver, guaranteed I pick up
The west coast like the phone is ringing, hello
Anybody on this phone this evening? Guess not
Jay Rock, out the bottom of Watts
Gangsta, ain't shit pop but the water in pots
We cookin the crack, distributin' to the block
Gettin' it back, I use the same formula for rap
I'm warnin' ya, leavin' more dead bodies for the coroner
Shootin any witness with a cornea
As far as rap, I'm best the rapper out of California
Warrior, in the 300 like a Spartan
Gladiator, blast a hater, put em in a coffin
For coughin', that thera-flu won't do
Gonna need more if you don't wanna see the lord
Tell me what ya livin' for like 2 times 2
I'm a sureshot like marksmen, you all dead
Cold red, money clippers if a nigga fold bread
That will feed four people for the next four years
I ain't just got ends, I end careers
Cosigned by the allmighty pac when I drop science
Like? I'm not lyin'
Put a scar on your face like Simba's uncle
Dumb fuck, I was built to tussle
Gangbang, murder state, west side of the mississippi
Where you can die like a shirt from an old hippie
Peep the irony, the heater on me when it's nippy
Hit a nigga on Q like I'm from the fifties
Roll through the sixties just to fuck withNnippsey
Hussle to the death like interpreters I'm hurtin' ya
I could close curtain ya, but I'll let you bleed
I'm a top dog, nigga, like?
Got the game on lock, but I'm stealin' the keys
Don't get it twisted, honey, I'm still with the bees
Like sean carter on the yacht, what you got, nothing, nigga
Give it up, circle round the block (BUCK-BUCK a nigga)
What the fuck, this is hip-hop to the third degree
Murder emcees, send 'em up, throw 'em in a burboun truck
Throw some gasoline on 'em, light a match, burn em' up
I don't think you heard enough, fuck it, let me turn it up
Grab ya bitch, turn her out, sell her for a couple buds
Put her on a stroll, bet she'll bring back a armored truck
Tell her I'm a city nigga, gritty nigga, grimy nigga
Even when you eyes closed, guaranteed you'll find me
In the Watts with a backroad, the hood made my heart cold
Put me in a loophole, now the nigga do shows
Kick flows like I knew martial arts
Raving at Peter Parker once a nigga climb the charts
All my real niggas follow, I don't fuck with pussy niggas
Fuck with real bloods, real crips, who you foolin', nigga?
Jay Rock, jack the ripper, rep for every ghetto
I'm a still be here even when the smoke settle on a sunset
Rollin' down sunset, hand on the wheel
Middle finger to the cops, give a fuck how they feel
I'm a ride like a freighttrain on ya rap-lames
Screaming Bounty Hunters got the projects on my back, mane
You ain't gotta aks mane, Jay Rock got it
Top Dawg, aka they got dollas
Big like Chris Wallace, fly like weed parlors
Sig on my lap, we'll pop your collar
From the land where the coolest cat will drop your mama
Mouthpiece like barack obama, but still street
Stilll creep through your set, I'm a thug I guess
Cold stares for the clothes I dress, I'm well aware of that
Niggas be hatin', soon as they jump like a car cable
Homie gon' be disabled, screaming for help
Tryin' to kill me? Better off killing yourself, because
It's suicide
The way I was raised, either do or die
You can die any given time, it's not promised
Hop out, spray lamas, come back with the bic mac
Hassle McDonalds on our house, what you 'bout?
Big money?, for cheap talk
Bumping your gums, you'll get your teeth lost
Play me for dumb, we bust guns, leave ya street-chalked
Do this for fun, we hit ya block, let the piece bump
Like pitbulls, get shookup when the flow cook up
Tell 'em I got the hookup like candyman on your steps
I command respect like a law permitted to y'all
Y'all never come brawl with the west coast general
Criminal background, tell mama her son rap now
No more hustling rocks up in that crackhouse
All I do is bring it to you, pay per view
Food for thought, brought wordplay, what you brought
I brought the big boys with me, my project people
Call me Bishop Lamont, stand on top of the church steeple
Writin' raps 'til my hands collapse
Starin' at the world from a different view like my crooked eye do
Hold my beach cruiser as I ride by you
With my Glasses on, shout out to Malone
Out-of-towners want to trip, then I'm ready to rob 'em
See I got that K boy, who wanna pile 'em
And that K got a Dot, if I let a shot go
Hit you in your Ab, and there go your Soul
On my misson ready to roll, let's do this to a living
But Jay said that's a felony cause niggas keep on telling
If a coward snitch on me, then this what I'll do
Pull the rocket out and let it bang loose
Then give his mama the blues, like SBI
Got hot dollars now, so the FBI
All inside of my ride, that's the Cadillac Fleetwood
If the west blow, shit, you know that the east would
I'm coastal with it, look, me and Mistah Fab
Doing fabolous digits, it's a family business
In the field with that, then you get stuck up
Give it to you every day, seven years of bad luck
Who got the gin and the juice, toss it up for my name
I don't know how many bars, but this not a game[Verse 1]
Hey, Groove the window down, oh, shit I'm getting high
Still I'm cool, no A/C needed
Probly sliding down ya region off this Henny got me leaning
Ain't no secret that we balling and your ho be refereeing
Bet I make that pussy whistle up and down that booty dribble
Was she foul? Just a little, tech-nical how she nibble, uhh
Ain't fucking with you losers, all my niggas won
It's Mr. BetIGotSumWeed, hey, split another one
Look down upon the ceiling
Just try to reach the sky cause when you up they all be kneeling
Contradictions in my thoughts and I just execute my feelings
Shake the nonbelievers off, I'm tryna navigate a million
But you first let's hit the store you know I love Korean
She tell me hurry up and buy, I hurry up I'm fiending
So I zip that, chop that, pass the blunt
Know my dick from last month but there's more to come, what the fuck?

[Hook]
Too, too fucking raw (Face down, ass up)
Too, too fucking raw (Face down, ass up)
Too, too fucking raw (Face down, ass up)
Too, too fucking raw (Face down, ass up)
When the sunshine, and the moonlight, in my life
Too, too fucking raw (Face down, ass up)
When the sunshine, and the moonlight, in my life
Too, too fucking raw (Face down, ass up)

[Verse 2]
Heroin, extacy, Oxycontin, Vicodin
Coca Cola, everything up in our jeans
Even methamphetamines, get this bread by any means
PCP, LSD, transactions frequently
Turn you job into a ki, turn that ki into a beach
Turn that beach into ur sleep, rest ya head, remain neat
Haters love to hate a G, gossip on ya bakery
Wish they had the recipe, swear this life is meant for me
Tired of cracking niggas heads in the stolen challenger
Hopped up out the passenger and merked the DA's messenger
Every corner, camera, nigga I'm just tryna live
Shitty on a shitty curb, niggas kill ya front your kids
See how niggas get it in, trapping so we live in sin
This felony won't keep me in I'm hungry gotta rob again
Embarrassing my mom and them, grandma bragging to her friends
Killing beef, apparently, name a nigga rare as me, yeah, I be

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
Got me swagged, then I put your style in a body bag
Man, I'm off a bag of that good, my flow off a powder pack
Man, I'm leaning hard, like I'm off that syrup, and I'm damn near tore up
With my dogs and locstas, and we all got stock like brokers
Ugh, we don't chase hoes, nah, hoes gon chase us, yeah
Straight to the condo, yeah, bitches ain't shit that's the mothafuckin' motto
In the Monte Carlo, yeah, sipping on Carlo, just me and my posse
Strapped up when you gotta know the ropes like Ted Dibiase
Look at my life raw, nigga, bitches wanna suck me off quicker
Haters can't stand my guts, nigga, because I get my bucks bigger
I'm on my own, I'm in my zone, bitch niggas can't knock me off my throne
I'm on my shit, cause septic tanks, I don't give a fuck what set you claim
Just get your money let the bullshit walk, I'mma get this cheese
Like a little rat bitch, fucking suck me good, nibbling through her team
Raw shit, nigga check me out, know you jocking my steez
Best believe nigga we run this shit, niggas know that I be, be

[Hook][Hook]

Niggas talking shit when we step up in the club
It's all good 'till you get hit with a slug
Yeah he on the wall, coughing up blood
Should have known not to fuck with us thugs
Catch me in the hood, blowing on bud
Nigga, fuck your dollar man, I'm all about dubs
Catch me in the kitchen, cooking up drugs
[?] I'm all for the bubs

[Verse 1]
I'm all over the stove like pots and pans
Hit the corner with the rock, the Glocks in hand
Rock hold more shells than a taco stand
If I pop, the block hot like a summer jam
Damn, I won't hesitate, to let the pistol whistle
Bullets like many missiles, go straight through your tissue
And your momma yelling, crying sneeze into some tissue
I'm like, damn Rock, you could have worked out the issue
Really hard in the club  without no bodyguards
This where OGs fresh out the penitentiary are
For those who don't know me don't pretend you're hard
Yeah that loud talking shit, that'll get you scarred
Left hook, knock your punk ass on your back
Your head busted, now it looks like the crack of her ass
Then I'm back posting up on the ave
With the homies smoking and joking, counting that cash

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm like a sound system bump base on the block
Niggas scheming, bulletproof doors on the drop
Well I ain't got a garage, '64 in the lot
In the city of god when they bust at the cops
I stay with a fed, always keep me a bitch
Always holding a crip, always keep me a clip
Yeah, these niggas like  to trip, I'll send them to their destination
To that hot place, you can talk it out with Satan
I'm hot faced, I was blessed with raw game
Bitches fiending for my dick, call me cocaine
In the hood, like tall cans and low daddies
I'm so so gutta like ghetto swords and [?] alleys
I'm from CA, but some call it killer Cali
Where we banging, get some bitches don't know who their [?] is
Twist up dro, laid back like recliners
Smoking on five, got me higher than airliners

[Hook]

[Outro]

Yeah it's Jay Rock niggas
Straight out the projects, Nickerson Gardens
DeeJay Dave, I see you my nigga
Fat Boy I see you my nigga
That's how we do it here
Top Dawg Entertainment mothafuckas[Hook: Jay Rock]
We boys in the hood
Pocket full of dubs
Homies outta line
Clip full of slugs
Baby here's my number
If you tryna fuck, baby do your thang
Shake shake it up
Sick of watts you claim, Come and give it up
Baby I'm a player, Go and hit me up
Baby do your thang
Shake shake it up, shake shake it up, shake shake it up

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
You should already know what I came for
Once the neon light hit the top dog logo
See my, chain hang out
See my, wrists hang out
See my, homies hang out
They, gang bang out
West coast my state, left coast my state, you state myspace, internet gangster
You know my name baby girl no stranger
Blue Bell jeans on low cut taper
No I can't save ya
Name that captain
[?] when I'm in the Aston, Martin
So awkward when I park it
Rev up your engines, sound like it farting
I'm in the club sitting with some foreign
She don't speak English words sound retarded
We go hard in that project apartment
Five minutes in Watts, get it started

[Hook: Jay Rock]

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Sit back relax I'mma give you a walk through, through the city of Watts, through the city of God
Where them bitches shaking that ass, deuce deuce in they bras
Where them niggas rocking that [?] that's hard
Where they keep the Glock in their pants, chopper's right in the car
And if you step up on the daily's you might leave with a scar
If your gang tight might leave with a broad and like two of her friends might enjoy a ménage
And that's night life, in Watts California
Parties ain't over till like six in the morning
This Hennessey's straight, gotta nigga zoning out
Take another swig then I'm rolling out
If you ain't banging better hold your mouth
Don't claim nothing that you know you're not
So just chill, grab your bitch because life's too short
Just stick to the script

[Hook: Jay Rock][Intro]

[Hook: Jay Rock]

Yeah I'm popping 44's, niggas better lock and load
Yeah I'm popping 44's, that'll leave your homies broke
Yeah I'm popping 44's, niggas better lock and load
Yeah I'm popping 44's, that'll leave your homies broke

[Verse 1: Emjae]

What you doing bout me
Many niggas ain't ready
I'm to deli when it come to the [?]
I bet he, tried to run like a nigga won't [?]
Rock's on down cause he on with [?]
Hanging round town like a nigga won't get it
Getting off pounds but his change still petty
Hop in that Chevy
They know that I'm heavy
If you niggas ain't scary
Then the better get ready
I'm Emjae, Emjae
No I don't play when I come with the K
Fuck a memory cause I come here to stay
Nigga you deceased cause you come here to lay
Straight about the [?] startin' shit with a full clip
So when a mothafucka tripped in a [?]
And then I make my bullets stick like hot grease
Stick like hot chicks, Nigga, I got this
Rock be popping 44's
Me I love that TEC and nina
Watch my lead hydrate your body like Aquafina
Any nigga fucking with me, I'm busting the piece
Bringing you the trouble how you want it to be
So fuck with these G's, otherwise have you down on your knees
Begging us please [?], you don't want it with we, see?
We got the projects going nuts
Any any nigga dissin' Watts, yeah we fucking 'em up
I'm Emjae niggas run away I rhyme to the beat
Straight off that Eastside 99th street, holla at me nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]

You niggas want beef, let's make it official
Cock and bust, sending plenty niggas to hospitals
I'm like Tom Cruise been through missions impossible
You trying to stop me, that's gon be a mission impossible
Aim I still [?] at ya, on the tip of the silencer
Red dot spotted ya, hollow tips gonna silence ya
Got a lock like slammers
I'm a MC good with hammers
Hit your block, spray
Nigga don't play
Put you in the garbage like [?]
I'm packin' a four
That'll make you rock and roll
That'll make you drop to the floor
These bullets burn a bit
Leave your eyes closed permanent
You don't wanna work my nerve
My nerve will tell me grab the bird
And when I get the bird
I'ma knock your brains up on the curb
And I'ma dip and swerve with the herbs and some syrup
And I'ma hit the church, send the word, have you murked
And a, a week later they gon be digging up dirt
And now you a memory, your face all up on a shirt[Intro]
Jay Rock, Watts Finest, Top Dawg Entertainment
Nigga finna spit 50 bars of real shit
Goes on in my hood, goes on in your hood too
Look I'm real sure

[Verse: Jay Rock]
Let me tell you all about Watts
Two-elevens, One-eighty-sevens, it don't stop
Shit ain't all great for your mama
On top carry lettuce workin' round the clock
You can't have your gat retired
Get caught slippin' and your life expired
Shit, growin' up, all I seen was drug dealin'
So I wanna live the life of a dope dealer
In the kitchen whippin' like Betty Crock
Sittin' in the spot with a gang of rocks
Clientele pumpin' now the spot is poppin'
Gotta shut it down, yeah them narcs is watchin'
Connect call the church said he got some Os
It might be tapped so we use them codes
Hit your high school just to bang the turf
Sockin' out shit, showin' off for hoes
Your girl know you out there makin' a grip
Hood rat bitches wanna sit on your dick
Now this nigga wanna fight you over a bitch
And they [?] his bitch out fuckin' for kids
Wonder why niggas lookin' at you funny
Cause you walkin' round with a lot of money
Nigga have the lights up [?]
Flossin' too hard so he got jacked
Niggas pull up on the side of him
And put about sixteen shots in him
Two witnesses saw the whole action
Police asked, but they don't know what happened
They know that snitchin' is a death wish
So they kept their mouth closed, they ain't said shit
They live by the code of the streets (what's that)
Never ever talk to police (that's right)
Gangstas on their way to a block party
Stopped at the store, gotta get Bacardi
Now they at the party all sauced up
Lookin' for dirty hoes to toss up
Some killers pull up in a Cutlass
Start bustin, and everybody duckin'
It's tragic when the guns stop spitting
Their lives, an innocent victim
And now he's wrapped up in plastic
His momma gotta shop for a casket
His homies don't know who did it
So they ride round town lettin' everybody feel it
Now another died on the other side
Killer Cali, land of the homicide
All we could do, was pray for them better days
Product of the streets, ghetto made us this way[Intro]

Jay Rock, K. Dot
Watts City finest, and the Hub City threat
LB I see you my nigga
Let's go

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
I'm trying to get cash, quick fast
In the back she's a [?]
With past of Trinidad
[?] plenty hash up in the stash
When you got gangsta black [?] up in the back room
When I walk back, more vicious than wildcats
I would have swallowed that
Nickerson Garden projects gain the profit
Of my lyrical content
Build a monument
Gotta put a clip to your conscience
Watch this, pull up on your block in a stick-shift
Pop six, watch you fall just from the fifth hit
The spliff lit, when I'm high can't I spit sick
First round, number one draft on [?] shit
Got the mind of a chief, the heart of a soldier
With a rifle got a hell of a range like rover
And the fight, got a hell of a strike like vipers
When the gat, got a hell of a aim like snipers

[Hook: Jay Rock and (Kendrick Lamar)]
You wanna act tough
Let's see if you really are, when this gun busts
Oh you say you want war, nigga let's go
Bring the drama, that's on my momma
You don't wanna rumble
Jay Rock I'll put you under
(You wanna act tough
Let me see if you really hard, when this gun busts
Oh you say you want war, nigga let's go
Bring the drama, that's on my momma
You don't wanna rumble
K. Dot will put you under)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Since VapoRubs mom's got my Nyquizzle
I was just a scrub now it's all about the bizzles
Trying to make a buck slinging weed and E pizzles
My nigga hit me up, and as far the stizzle
I'll eat your ass up show you how a bullet fizzle
Get your ass touched one hand on your whizzle
The other on the clutch,  my middle finger up
Shit I'm not giving a fuck
Catch me on Rosecrans and Central leanin' like I'm supposed to
My brain is mental a nigga stay focused
Plus I'm in the hood with the hood rats and roaches
Caught crack, and served a three-fifth on my culture
Desert Eagle on me these niggas acting like vultures
I ain't dying homie I swear that your thoughts is bogus
Keep the iron on me I'll crease you flat if you approach us
Acting how you act you gone get some out of that holster

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
I'm a Watts living soldier nigga
I ain't running, I'ma stand my ground
I'ma keep on gunning
My momma never raised a punk, nigga I ain't a chump
You disrespect you'll be on my thump
Ghetto kill, make you lift up
You don't wanna get struck
Like a match, got a back
That'll break a shit bruh
I attack with a Mac, that'll tear your shit up
Now the paramedics gotta come and make that pick up
Dog, I hit your block in a pick-up
Jay Rock I'm me, a lion, a man, a [?]
I do it by myself, with a hook and an uppercut
Doctor got a stitch you up
Nigga are you real or what
I'm a little guy but I'm tough
I hit hard then I'm natural
You a dead man when my gat bust
If you running nigga better run a little faster
These bullets like Heinz oh yeah they'll catch ya

[Hook][Produced by Willie B]

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Everybody focused on this animal
Someone who push the envelope, the remedy the antidote
Mix the Henny and the Coke
Sell the tree and the dope
Rain sleet and the snow, do we sleep? Hell no
Pop a tag and pull up in a Elco
Bag a bitch at Elco, run up in her tailbone
Grindin cuz I sell mo, hotter then that hell boy
Fresher than an altoid, see me in them tabloids
Actin like a damn fool, running from them bad boys
Keep a Will Smithon Wessen
BIG shell out my weapon, hit you like an astroid
Get high wit androids
I'm outta space wit this shit
Pass the L to Elroy. I ain't took a L boy
I ain't never lost nigga. big heat on me blood
Click defrost nigga. Lookin at a boss nigga
Fuck you an yo boss nigga
Iron on me, ever see a hunter play golf nigga?

[Hook:]
Lotta niggas don't wanna see me shine

All I know is...
(Guns, Drugs, Bitches, Money) [x2]
All I Know is...
(Guns, Drugs, Bitches, Money) [x2]
All I Know is...

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Top of the morning while niggas yawnin
I'm in ya bushes when no ones looking I'm on it
Guerilla Warfare, bananas in the regal trunk
Get you cerebral slumped, my shotty is the people's pump
Asthmetic gotta bad habit for bad bitches and black
Fabric, Black on Black Benz that swerve through bad traffic
Bag back. I sip yach and leave hash ashed "Pass that
Nigga, tryna high in this motha fucka" Thats what the homie said
I rolled another one and took that bitch to the head
Yeah. Then made yo bitch gimme head
Didn't take much she off a half a pill in remi red
Yeah. And my eyes rly red, like my flag or the 5 ball Jag
Zoom past like a lightyear. 100 racks thats a light year yeah, yeah

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
Breakin' niggas off like a Kit-Kat
If you ain't talking no dollas nigga don't chit chat
I'm in and out the set like I direct
And if I come across a pound of powder I'mma fluoresce
Holla at ya parter of the water got the purest
I ain't talking arrow head we getting dinero here. Yeah
California I'm the Pharaoh Head starin down the barrel
Of a nine if you don't recognize, boy
Get yo' attitude set aside. I gotta team of choppers for you jealous guys
Haters, they don't really want to see me shine
So I hit 'em where it hurts when they see me ride
With two bad bitches with some chinky eyes
After I was in the club wit my heat inside
Jay motherfuckin' Rock never slippin'
I'mma boss, I'm forever pimpin. Motherfucker

[Hook:][Verse 1: Jay Rock]
I was on the block right, wasn't in my right mind
Just a young nigga, hustling, trying to get mines
Movin' with the 9 double M
Niggas like, "You don't really wanna fuck with him"
Yeah, young teenager, infatuated with paper
Yeah I had to get it cause momma, she wasn't able
Black and white TV set, no cable
40's in the fridge, chicken noodles on the table
I wasn't born with a silver spoon
Child of the ghetto, raised off a different tune
Watching Bob Barker in my living room
If the price was right, I could get you a whole living room
Yeah, them was my gutter ways back in the gutter days
No education but the gutter pays, through it all, I came a long way
From selling the yay, fist fights to gun play, back then

[Hook]
Sittin' on the block and I'm doing bad
Dreaming about the things that I never had
Got me thinking to myself I gotta get it man
You can play if you want, I'm gon' get it man
I say, all my life I've known one day eventually, I'll blow

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, times is hard as it is
That's why I got guns and my guns got kids
That's why I be going so tough on them hoes
I play my own hand, I don't shuffle or fold
Fuck with a nigga, let go fuck with some hoes
Hear them bitches screaming like they stuck in a hole
I am not a demon but was once a lost soul
Till I found myself a block away from the cross road
I have outgrown the fishbowl
And I'm on my feet like a fuckin insole
Yeah it may hurt like a fucking lymph node
But it's fuck the world like a fucking nympho
And we spend dough cause we make more and I make sure when I say so
It's Jay Rock and Weezy, need I say more?
Clothesline the beat, Ted DiBiase flow, yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
Jay Rock, still that same O.G
I ain't trying see the grave or the penitentary
Everyday living, trying to stay on my feet
Even though a nigga paid but my heart in the streets
See my dogs, I'm a beast, so hard on these beats
So my family can eat, I'll be damned if I see no income
Here come Jay Rock, they know crack music, drug kingpin flow, oh

[Lil Wayne]
Kingpin ho, need I say more?
Your family could die, when I say go-go
Green light, green light, what ya green like?
Before ya sign me up, get the scene right
And I just hop in the phantom when I'm feelin nice
Cause driving slow in the Lam', it doesn't seem right
Yeah and I remember them long nights
Living the wrong life but I made that wrong right, Weezy

[Bridge]
All the struggling, all it does is keep my hustling, oh my

[Hook][Intro: Will.I.Am]
The ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
The ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
Oh, haha, oh!
Oh, haha, oh!

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Still riding through the ghetto with the metal right on side of me
Kill a California nigga, palm trees and poverty
East side, wild city; got my block with me
Bags of that kush, big bottles, sip a lot of Henny
In the ghetto with my goons and my real bitches
Nothing but a B thang, show you where we bang (Nickerson!)
Hurry on the grind, getting Benjamins
Yeah, we either selling a pill or meds for dividends
Keep heaters for the evil trying to greet us
Death around the corner, you don't want to meet the reaper
All we know is Blood money, we ain't never had a visa
Trying to wade in that reefer, only thing that could feed us
Had the ghetto with my Bloods since the days of a fetus
Raised by the streets, so it's nothing you can teach us
Bring the word like a preacher
Jay Rock a.k.a bring the real to the people

[Hook: Will.I.Am]
In the ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto, g-ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
I comes from the bottom but now I'm on top, ain't no one stop me yo
I comes from the ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
Where all of my niggas, where all of my niggas
And all of my niggas will roll up in the spot and get ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto

[Verse 2: Eastwood]
They say the boy beast on the mic, like whoa
When the homies show him love? Like, everywhere he go
Black rag up the back pocket, different than the 'fo
West coast till I'm gone, I'm here to let you niggas know
Eastwood in this motherfucker, swanging like a [warner?]
Even if I have to push a couple rocks on the corner
I posted on the corner, blowing that marijuana
With a loaded .45, for haters that really want it

[Verse 3: Omar Cruz]
Not  just because you [?] guns
Living that thug life, cause only homies show me love
What you expect from us? All we know is the hood and drugs
It was the debt on us, that's why they keep us in the slums
But I was built in [?], in the ghetto (stop)
Why go to war, when they shoot me here like Papa Rock
I gotta make it out cause nobody else will
And momma love to see me up in XXL (Oh cool!)

[Verse 4: ScHoolboy Q]
You niggas know who it is, and it's easy to see (yeah)
Number-one emcee, it ain't easy to be (nah)
Twin Glock ain't show when I'm speaking the flows
Get snobbish on a bitch, I ain't speaking to hoes (bitch!)
Still grinding every day, stay puffing a blunt
Cops are robbing, (hell no!) we play Crips and Bloods
Make it rain on the streets, still make it flood
(ScHoolboy Q!) Yeah, roll out the rug

[Verse 5: Ab-Soul]
Ab-Soul, what you gonna tell me
I ain't trying to see the grave, I'm just want to get paid
In full, like ace till momma's straight
And if I go to jail, tell mom I'm straight
Cause I, chose this life, and now I lead it
Got too rich - got two cents? Keep it
Cause you might need it, more than I
All My Life Remix, brought to you by:

[Hook]

[Bridge: Glasses Malone]
This what you doing for town, huh Rock
Watts that's what it do, Watts stand up
All My Life, yeah I've been waiting for this

[Verse 6: Glasses Malone]
No Rocka-fella had me pissed off
[?], make the pain get lost
Now I'm popping on the charge, like a tube of lip gloss
Breaking old niggas off, like I'm hella Rick Ross
Scream "New West" had everybody pounding
Like I give a fuck, tell them do something about it
Waited my turn, yeah feel my buzz
Now it's me and Jay Rock, and all eyes on us, uh

[Verse 7: Crooked I]
I, I, I know you coppers expect me to fail
Oh well, I'm living life on the executive scale
You want to do me like Sean Bell, never spend a second in jail
Go to hell, i got records to sell
Me and Jay Rock, getting this cheese
You can ask my homie Adolf, he wrecked them niggas in [?]
I'm in Long Beach, feeling the breeze
Nobody graduated on my block, it's still is a million degrees

[Verse 8: Nipsey Hussle]
I came in this game with a dollar and a dream
Posted on a block, blue collar wasn't me
My momma put me out, and I would step up in the streets
But I ain't mad at her, cause it made me a beast
I come from the era of the "Fuck The Police!"
We [?] pick you up and drop you off down the street
And say I'm too street and pay bitches on these beats
But they all ever seem to hear is all red [?]

[Verse 9: Sinful]
Vamos, todo mi vida en el barrio no supe mas
Long Beach California vecinos de Watts
Mira como abrazo el [?]
Y ahora mira lo que toque, yo
No más pistolas y rosas, no
No más [?] con fácil copas, no
Aprendí si no hay [?] nadie avanza
El barrio nos [?] [chansas] y [los] [planchas]
Amor a las calles, que me criaron a mi
A ese que murió porque me brincaron a mi
Fuiste lo mas real desde que te conocí
Mucha sangre, mucha lágrimas yo lo vi
El esfuerzo tatuado en mi cuerpo
El mejor secreto guardado por cierto
Descanso con un ojo despierto
Silencio soy el águila del [?]

[Verse 10: Ya Boy]
I used to Christmas shop in the dollar store
And let a boy spend guap at the Prada store
I gotta, thank God for my rhyming though
Beause everyone in the hood trying to blow
And I ain't trying to say I got it honest though, cause
I was right there at that corner store
I had it all - from the pills to the pot to blow
I even had cream, like Rocky Road
I thought getting out the hood was impossible
That's all I know, I ain't that responsible
So I'ma stay right here, where it's logical
And I can buy this twenty-fives in popsicles
All of a sudden, this rap got popping though
Heard he rap, but he look so rock-n-roll
Call me Ya Boy, who better? Cause I got the note
If you ain't talking money, then I got to go. Bye!

[Verse 11: Roccett]
Pass to the streets, I done mastered rap
Got the black bandana with the strap to match
Got the blue bandana with the Chucks to go
As I rock throwback like the huxtables
Man, Carson too rich, you can head to the pack
We made a name down there, and they'll vouch for that
You can go ask Jeezy, or go and ask Puff
Go and ask Kan, I grind for mine

[Verse 12: T.K.]
I got a sick swagger, short as a dagger knife
I'ma send us to the beach, just for bragging rights
My whip lean, my shoes clean
Diamond watch, low-key
All sip, mint green
Doing my thing, in the fast lane man
I'm Terry Wayne Kennedy, you niggas [?] don't fronting me
I've been trying to be telling you niggas that be killing me? You need to stop it

[Verse 13: Problem]
(You got it back, huh?) Guess who's mad in the game?
I got a new deal, so I bought me a chain
I know it weren't smart but fuck it it's gone
Marshmallow-sized rocks, got the luckiest charm
Pitching for the top, like I've stuck it all
Look like new waves but I' stuck them home
Niggas want to creep when they think you on
So the heat stay around me like I'm stuck in a stove, my lord!

[Hook]

[Verse 14: Young Keno]
(I feel you Jay)
I came from a single-parent home, mom did all the dirty work
Only good day is when we could hear the birdies chirp
And even though I moved a little  work
I still suited up for a Sunday at Church
Then back to the block, to diss a few [packs?]
Damn, it felt good to count a few stacks
This day and night though, I know it ain't right
But down in the hood, man, this is our life

[Verse 15: Spider Loc]
I won't lie on y'all, my only concern, is y'all don't lie on me
My speech slurred, cause I'm buzzin'
Jay Rock, they hatin' cause I'm buzzin', cousin
And the blue rag kicking it harder, but the red shit sticking in water
Both feet [?] hard on the angle
Hood on the back [?], stars on the ankle

[Hook]

[Verse 16: 211]
Product of the block, young rider from the block
Used to run on 'em niggas, [?] rob them with the Glock
In the hood we the mind workers, hood like a job
Got my enemies hot, cause I made a [?]
We from ashy to classy, no jewels to flashing
Hundred thousand dollars but still wearing khakis
I'm a, i'm a hustler, I get it from my daddy
I heard the [?] want me, they gon' have to come and catch it

[Verse 17: Bangloose]
Yeah, yeah I'm at the top now, haters hate to see me popping
What's now? From the Fronts to the George Downs?
I'm on fire, that means that I'm high man
I'm so cocky, you wish you could be [Bane?]
You can't stop me, I live like the gutter lane
Banging you so tight, like a [bike chain?]
You done fucked up, yelling by the poolside
Yeah, [?] socks, [?]

[Hook]

[Verse 18: Mistah F.A.B.]
Listen to the pain of a real crack baby
My daddy died, now he ain't coming back baby
Momma be stressing, I told her I was blessed
So worried for Christmas, she bought me a present
My brother smoke coke, my sister on dope
My little nigga's driving, they tired of being broke
In and out of jail, I'm living in hell!
Little girl got raped, and she ain't even yell!

[Verse 19: Roscoe Umali]
Came from nothing, rose from slums
Now your boy Roscoe doing shows out in London
Ain't that something? Your boy been hustling
End of the day, can't say nothing from 'em
God damn, I'm a good ass rapper
Half these wack rappers is some good actors
Seen them on TV, and be lie that's gangsta
But in real life, they ain't shit - they can't spit

[Hook][Intro]
Uh
Yeah
I like this right here
See stuff like this
You just speak what you feel like
I mean you just say whatever is on your mind, like you know
When I say things, I just want people to feel me
You feel me?

(That's right)

[Verse 1]
Dwelling with my killers
Smoking good
Blowing on that killa
Word on the streets
Niggas wanna kill us
We got choppers
They don't want to feel it
Say they want problems
Motherfuck they feelings
Nickerson gardens
We natural born fucking killers
Bustin down birds
Tryin to get a million
But we gotta eat
Feedin all our children
Getting paper
Stack it to the ceiling
Straight gutter
Heart colder than a blizzard
Leaning of the sizzurp
Twisting up the hizzerb
Rock be the name
Game sharper than some scissors
Baby what it is?
Tell me what the wizzord
You got ass
I'm a whistle as you twizzirl
Keep it live
365
Got my chest out and my head to the sky
But

[Hook]
I'm so anti-social
Cause fake ass niggas I can't stand close to
Some of these niggas actin like they know you
But as the world turns only time will show you
That's right (that's right)
I'm so antisocial
Cause fake ass niggas I can't stand close to
Some of these niggas actin like they know you
But as the world turns only time will show you
That's right

[Verse 2]
Looking good in my chevy
Wish my granny could see me
Rest in peace Mimi
Wish my daddy could see me
But the lord took him away
All I have now is memories to play
Can somebody tell me why the ones you love the most
Always be the ones that go
Got my gun on my shoulders and my heart on my sleeve
Make every moment count never know when your soul gotta leave
Just to escape from stress, I smoke some weed
Getting high to the point when I'm not able to speak
Fuck friends, all I have is me
Keep your enemies close
Cause family envy
That's cold blooded
That's my life and it's rough
Gat in my palm running your mouth then I'm gonna bust
I ain't a hater, my homie I don't cuff
Jealousys the root of evil
And ladies I don't trust

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I just mind my business
And do what I'm supposed to, man
Represent the apple, keep it real on garageband
Why every year I lose someone that I'm close to
That's why I stay strapped in every club that I walk through
Never know, crazy whack haters might hawk you
Stalk you, spock you, shell put a part through
Gat in my car when I ride in the dark too
When I let it off it's a light now say goodnight (goodnight)
Is that simple homeboy
Shoot your fingers throwing up the wrong symbol homeboy
And we could clash like a thimble homeboy
Rase the bar, duck shots if you can do the limbo homeboy
(Oh boy!)
You're not a limber homeboy
You can get stretched out running the motor in your mouth
That's why

[Hook][Verse 1: Punch]
Yeah, uh, let’s go deep inside the mind of a project veteran
Raised with nothing on the block with his brethren
A fifth of hennessy, swisher filled up with medicine
Devilish grin, inhale deep, let the devil in
Compelling stories between him and his men
Feel like a rap cypher except way more liver
With intimate details, shades of a grey writer
Hit a plight of a ghetto survivor
Deuce five in his waist, impatiently waiting
Trying to get richer, priors hanging over his head
Serving as reminders
Ain’t nothing funny, his stomach turn
And his eyes burn, soul on ice
So far from Christ, he had to fight
Any disagreement, he take flight
No thinking twice, anything further and the slug’s ‘gon fly
Project mind, the choice, his life or mine
That’s a very thin line, tell momma I tried
Hood got ‘em sprinkling lines, Mary don’t get ‘em high
Something to justify the stress in his lifetime
Like why his lil mama cute face, nice thighs
Strip on the side and set niggas up for a time
Project bread, baby was three when her daddy died
Shot seventeen times and he almost survived
That’s where she hang her whole pride
That’s really where she tried to hide
All the pain deep inside, the project mind

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Started off flipping on a mattress, pissy
Slapboxin’ won’t sock him until he hit me
Streetlights come on, runnin’ through them hallways
Dope spots open, sherm heads all day
Crackheads speaking with they teeth missing
Pushin’ shopping carts with cans in them
Dope dealers keep pitching, and while she keep bitching
She at the county building, they cut off her GR
How she gonna feed the children?
He got a chip on his shoulder, keep a pistol let his clip show
Rob the dice game because he piss poor, all the homies know it’s him
Desperate time equals desperate measures
Walk away all you see is stretchers
Niggas in the kitchen with the yay tryna stretch it
So we can buy Benzs and bag bad bitches
Cause growing up niggas never had riches
Niggas will die trying to get that cash, kill ‘em

[Verse 3: Punch]
The project mind is hustle by design
Too many spots in the hood set up across state lines
Extend the brand, franchise expansion
Guerrilla marketing plan, ensure the hood’s advancement
Groomed in criminology, equivalent to a Ph.D
Doctorates degree at any Ivy League college
Skull and Bone fraternity, oh forsaken
We promise to gang ban eternally
Death before dishonor

[Verse 4: Jay Rock]
Nigga respect for your honor, they fuck niggas, no condoms
My nigga got life for powder, pop shots it’s problems
Fuck your sign, nigga we rivals
Broke niggas is plotting cut-throat conniving
Smoke niggas for iron, prey on the weak
Predators lurking, you better not sleep nigga
All red bandanas, we deep nigga
Gorillas and the miss bananas be the clips
Concrete jungle come and take a trip, the wildlife
Wild days and wild nights
National Geographic images capture hazardous
High definition camera shit, if you flash better blast it quick
Or be labeled a bitch, niggas is gone, project shit
Better watch who you with the paperwork said he snitch
Plug tiles on that relationship

[Verse 5: Punch]
You could tell a project nigga by the scars on his neck and face
Clothesline caught him running from Jake
Runaway slave confined to a hundred and eighth
Central Compton Avenue to Imperial
My pops told me that the saga continues from
Milk and cereal to candle light visuals
Gangsters turn spiritual prayers never make it past the ceiling
Sherm sticks numbs the feelings of the killings, that’s the ritual
Visiting room at capacity, little homie in critical
He never got a visual on who shot him
Him and his men, same niggas
Who did is sitting, plotting they revenge in the hospital
Knowing it was him he proceeds to squeeze on the rifle
Says “spark the beef” rifle techs, hollow tips, vest
Concrete jungle tribal wars, survival of the 'jects
Ignorance is vexed, welcome to my consciousness

[Bridge: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Well, it’s the project mind
Well, it’s the project mind
Well, it’s the project mind
State of emergency

[Outro]
This was no-no place for me not to go
So guess this is the same mentality the Bloods and Crips have
As far as not being able to go on certain avenues because one is red and one is blue
So if they saw you up in here, you know you would stab me
This was one of the projects, that was the strongest out of all the projects
And it was called this right here, The Nickerson Gardens
This was a first for me
And actually if I had took my fear away
Could come...could come into the famous Nickerson Gardens
Now I still won’t come up here at night…[Hook: June Summers]
I'm a army all by myself
A soldier if nothing else
An army (I ball) and I want it all (I want it all)
Them O.G.s that brought us up
Them young boys that's coming out
The wars speak won't stop with the call (won't stop with the call)

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Look, I'm from the hood, won't never turn my back on it
Got balls tryin' to make it with this rap homie
And the boy get his hustle on
Keep my 45, I don't need no muscle homes
Got the heart of a hundred soldiers
Got my town on my back, and it feels like a hundred boulders
Now that's pressure, the boy never fold with it
Serve you a dish, look nigga I'm cold with it
In the bricks with my 'G'-double 'O'-'N's
Mack 10 loaded im my 5-double 'O'-benz
Ridin' on my enemies, got no time for friends
All about business, got my eyes on ends
Homies said they're your homies, some niggas pretend
Forget about your ass, when you hit that penn
Jay Rock and Nipsey, yeah we out to win
Red and blue make green, bitch niggas hating

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hu$$le]
Look, our city never quite shook off
The recipes of Ricky Ross
Couple of niggas rolled, but most just took a loss
While the real bosses passed bills in city hall
Legislate the law for the niggas that cookin' raw
The razor blades and rocks get cut on fine china
My blocks economics like the beers [?]
The black man's sacrificial land for the concept
A land based on the false prospect of progress
For instance
[?]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Look, my niggas crooked though it seems
My every single thoughts caught up in collectin' cream, a made nigga
Picture me dyin' in the blaze of gunfire
Will not retire till I'm paid till I reach the pie
When we ride we fly by bitches blow me kisses
Niggas from Compton to Brooklyn come on get your riches
From Crenshaw to 1-2-5 and do or die
Rollin' with niggas from Long Beach to Long I
I'm heartless now cause my heart froze
Once I commence my show I rip apart foes
Now I got one nation just a crooked compilation
Just the inner bullshit let's get back to money makin'
Tell them bustas that I rolled on controllin' a house
My shit's so wicked when I flip niggas closin' they mouthh
Them cocoa brothers, Buckshout the beady eyed thug
Greg Nice, LS, Asu, sure show a nigga love Outlaw![Intro: Jay-Rock (K-Young)]
Yeah, just thinking back, (mmmmmm)
Just thinking, yeah
Back in the days when I was young
I'm not a kid anymore
But could somebody tell me, where did them days go?
(Back in the days, back in the)
Tell me, where did them days go?
(Back in the days, Back in the days)

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Smoking on a blunt and I'm reminiscing
When I was just a young nigga with dreams and big wishes
Just a little guppy, swimming with big fishes
I was like seven, my favorite channel eleven
Couldn't wait to see them Simpsons, a cartoon fanatic
My parents on drugs, who didn't have habits?
But ain't nobody perfect on this earth surface
You live then you die, that's life's purpose
But I miss them good times, been through the worsest
But I gotta thank God for blessing us
I ain't never had nothing, first day of school
My excuse, my momma waiting for a check to come
And I ain't had no gear, but I ain't shed one tear
Because my momma never raised a punk, yeah
But through the midst of it all I miss them old days
Granny cooking gumbo, my daddy bumping his ol-days

[Hook: K-Young, (Jay Rock)]
Back in the days when I was young
I'm not a kid anymore
But can somebody tell me (where did them days go)
Where did they go? Where did they?
(Tell me, where did them days go?)
Where did they go?
(Tell me, where did them days go?)
Where did they go?

Back in the days when I was young
I'm not a kid anymore
But can somebody tell me (where did them days go)
Where did they go? Where did they?
(Tell me, where did them days go?)
Where did they go?
(Tell me, where did them days go?)
Where did they go?

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Big head little nigga, running with my click
On the train tracks, throwing rocks and shit
Flipping on pissy mattresses, in the back of the jam
Big homie's trafficking, who didn't have to sin?
To put some food on the table to feed they family
Cause being broke is no joke, it brings insanity
How I know? I seen it everyday
Smoke is up and down the block, tripping, gone off the yay
Crack pipes, bullet shells, in the sand where we play
Dead body in the street, seen it every other day
Sittin' in the house, now I'm watching the box
Wrote my first rap, man I thought I was Pac
Back in 9-4, when the bricks was live
Some hoods was at peace, some hoods broke ties
But through the midst of it all I miss them old days
Granny cooking gumbo, my daddy bumping his ol-days

[Hook]

[Verse 3: K-Young]
I was a little young buck soaking up the game
Wondering how the fuck I'm gonna make it, out here, no-o-o
I could be like the niggas I grew up with
On the block serving crack rocks, all that shit, but noooo, no not me
And even though I got real killas that live on yo street
I don't be sounding the alarm when I got beef
I got me
(Cause if it's going down muthafucka)
I got me
And this is for my momma
Made a nigga strong, "Go hard when there's drama,"
My aunties and all my cousins
Relatives, all my loved ones this is for you!

[Hook][Produced by Havoc]

[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
Most of these niggas shouldn't be next to us
We keep our distance from those, those acting like hoes
Zany imposed, weed in my clothes, cubics is gold
Your wig'll get told, put the realest niggas
Niggas, product of cap pillers, gangbangers, and dealers
Streets keep watching, aye, click boom the ghetto bird get shot down
Straight to the top now, they want a third strike on my background
But nah homie, put the mask on when I slide on 'em
Put the cash in the safe and here's a extra slug 'fore I shake
You smoke faster than me with a eighth
Or better yet a wet break on a plate
Burning your faith, all your senses covered in tape
Fuckin' with them boys in blue, chill out before I send them rags at you
You running to the cops saying, "How we do?"
Saying it's just rap and them lines ain't true
So I just do Q, fuck it, a ménage à two, or maybe trois
Baby girl need a papa, I be her dada
Coochie smacking, give praise to Allah
Get blazed in my car, with Oxymoron, Rock

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Rock got it, Rock came from rock bottom
Sparked the flames, still remain as a top shotta
I ain't no backpack rapper, I ain't no lyricist
And if we ain't talking to you, mind your business then
Cold with it, Black Hippy, yeah, we cold niggas
All the girlies love us, get a whiff of us
They bones quiver, heard some clown throwing stones at us
Holding boulders champ once you hear that "YAWK," watching domes shatter
It's Top Dawg we runnin' rap, whack rappers, feline
Reason why we don't run with cats
Nine double O five nine, where my family at
Pull up in that family van holding tools like the handyman
And to be real not with all this rapping politickin'
Rapper competition, wrapped up my position
'Til I'm finished, 'til I make a couple tickets
Then I'm outtie on them islands with my crimmies chillin'
Hide your feelings, now can I live?
Look I gotta keep my feet on top of the dirt
Cause everywhere I go they like "When you dropping some work?"
Been a threat since birth
The rap game's pallbearer when I'm droppin' the hearse
I ain't new to this, I'm true to this
Industry's nightmare, red strings in my Nike Airs
Yeah, the white pair, I'm Jay Rock, America's most wanted
My charges? Killing MC's without warning
Rock!

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
It's Ab-Soul, gimme the loot, I'm the skinny Biggie
In New York City with Puffy, puffing a sticky
All odds against me, still even the score
Probably why I'm always OT on tour
TDE, believe me we want war
I don't even know what piece I like most no more
Two fingers, two triggers, what's the difference?
We all gon' die one day, until then I'm gettin' paid
My grandma watching so I ain't gon' curse
Still gifted like a Wale verse, backwood full of OG
Bobby Johnson medicine in my soul to trynna dodge the coffin
And these days are so bittersweet
I guess it's just a balance we battle naturally
And y'all still trippin' off of Jay-Z tweets
I still got laps to run when me and Jay-Z meet
Peep, Soul brother number two
The first one used to make beats for CL Smooth
Top got the S550 but the CL smooth
And rolling weed is the only time I see L's move
Soul!

[Verse 4: Isaiah Rashad]
I think I found my second home
Sunny California and it's your little nigga brother
You ain't meant for corners, it's what they told me
So I never looked back, I got a shell in the bag
Fat as elephant ass, so we flirt in the path
Passing propellers I tell her, tell her we flying just listen
See we diamond just shining and they gon' find us glistening
Brought sand to the beach and we left with your bitch
For the record in Guinness I'm a hecklin' menace
Where is Robin, I'm Given', fuckin' minding my business
He a regular victim, of some regular in women
Regular niggas, you always cater to sluts
You always wasting my time, you always faking the funk
I put your motherfuckin' dream in your face
You keep lookin' for some women to be all in your face
That deep dussy reach niggas, keep dussy
That Tennessee dussy make a nigga be dussy
You can never rap better than me, cause you ain't dedicated
You ain't underrated, you ain't  underlooked
You ain't overbooked, you just undercooked
It's supposed to be me and my niggas in the record book
Now they got me out here by myself still fresh as fuck

[Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar]
I hate y'all, I'd do anything to replace y'all, shout out to Face Mob
A ghetto boy 'til I'm unemployed with a day job
And kicking boxes, I kick ass and then kick knowledge
I'm way more polished than 99% of the scholars you thought had graduated
I'm the master that masturbated on your favorite emcee
Until the industry had wanted me assassinated
You either corny or an opportunist
I let you eat, now go back to church and steal crackers at communion
What I been doing? I'm about to crack the Da Vinci Code
Yeah, and nothing's been the same since they dropped Control
And tucked a sensitive rapper back in his pajama clothes
Ha-ha, joke's on you, high-five
I'm bulletproof, your shots'll never penetrate
Pin a tail on a donkey, boy, you been a fake
I got my thumb on Hip Hop, and my foot in the back of your ass
Aftermath get the last laugh
I serve niggas like master Geoffrey
Jump on the curb, turn a shotty to a verb if you let me
You know I'm a killer, I'm on your head, you know I'm a killer
The West Coast Cosa Nostra under oath 'til it's over
You over owe us, so what the fuck?
I fuck you niggas up, I fuck you niggas up, she suck and fuck
I fuckin' duck you fuckin' niggas like when I want
You go at us, you going fuckin' nuts
Acting irrational, pop you then pop an Adderall
Know the drill like a lateral, nigga
I'm more Pappy Mason than Pastor Mason
Pacing back and forth, racing my thoughts on embracing Daytons
I spilled blood on my apron cooking this shit up
I feel like some of y'all is hating
Quite frankly your bitch booty should thank me for grabbing it
Turn these hoodrats to actresses, what a magic trick?
Accidents never happen when murder's involved
Emaculate tactics so follow me, if you need me just call on me
I say "Hold up, wait a minute
Your career ain't shit unless you got some Kendrick in it!"
Your pussy ain't shit, ain't no room is left on my dick
Unless you look like Jordin Sparks, make my mark on the clitoris, muah
Hollywood's been good to me, lil' hood nigga used to pawn mom's jewelry
Family jewels big as fuck and I got the balls to say it
Balls deep, ballin' out 'til Spalding need a replacement
I'm outchea, the West in your mouth, chea
Invest in the vests of Vietnam vets when you out near
The white court building spilling its Merlot
Fillin' women, a Virgo, pimp the industry
Remember these Stacy Adams and furcoats
Shook, you're scared to death, you're scared to look
In the mirror when Kendrick is near you
King, Kendrick[Chris Sutton]
Listen, I can make the Devil say Jesus
Got a crew full of leaders
So far ahead of y'all the sun sets between us
That could make you upset, you live beneath the sunset
Boy, I'm so fire, I could prob'ly make the sun sweat
Preme won't hit me back (?) I'm still runnin'
Drop me in the jungle watch me come out with a full stomach
Beats on the menu, sit me at the dinner table
Eat so many rappers I could shit out a record label
(?) ain't really the place to slang on
They gon' let the bullets tackle you like you got pads on
Rap circles 'round you niggas so fast I could start a sandstorm
Fall out the sky, and a star is what I land on
Ironically I'm cold as ever, hotter then a solar flare
If y'all cool...I guess that makes me a polar bear
You dont want (?) trust me no (?) for trying
Homie I was (?) kitty litter (?)
Everybodys swagged out, but you look like a bum, dummy
Yo my swag can take yo swag's lunch money

[XV]
It's been a long day, I went home an drank some bombay
Got my old girl tryna make-up, like stronjay
I'm just tryna get to a mil, I'm chasin' Andres
Stravin' artist, I'm rubbin' my belly like Beyonce
Crew move ways, press O's no latte(??)
And made three thousands like the madre of Andre
"You ain't like them other dudes", that's what my mom say
I was the crazy one in that group, DeVante
Do it the Don way, gettin' chips like picante
Rippin it down the parkway listenin the the (?)
I dont spit it I just kick it like conmatae(?)
Now they tryna put me in rings like a fiance
Square in the circle, don't call me Urkel
The Kid With the Green Backpack will leave you purple
So lets keep it verbal
Cause maybe not me but my entourage do keep shells, no turtle
Wichita, Kansas, yep that what he rep
On your B-E-T T-V sets, they need X
Cause I'm like a T-rex
Yo girl like a t-shirt
Cause everytime I step out she tryna give V-neck
Vizzy!

[Jay Rock]
I'm a rock in a hard place
Surrounded by smiles and they all fake
Show be the best, watch me still outshine(?)
Like the po-po did P Diddy in 99
You dont feel me, you fear me, thats the bottom line
I'm out my mind
I set up shop at the Promanade
Whoa, it's been a long time coming
I Guess I got the stamina for this rap and yo woman
My life is like chess the watchin my every move
Class in session, Jay take 'em to school
Spittin on tracks, nah (?) I (?)
Like a short yellow bus, big helmets and twos
I'm an animal, and this rap game is a zoo
Thought they were 'lympians, until they came to Zeus
Guess its in my genes, 'member (?)
Straight dope talkin right on B-E-T too
Rock!

[Gilbere Forte]
Im usually on some first name basis
But dudes mess my name up so much I wanna change it
A wise man told me to live what my mama gave me
A chance to see life outside of a lady
Yeah, we was born Kings, before I ever wrote it
History never written, If I ain't ever quote it
Your blog ain't ish, if I ain't ever post it
87 dreams on your baby girl tell em post it
I let a chick blow me down til she brain dead
Just to give her a lil taste of what fame is
Fly city to Illadel Im famous
Gilbere Forte tatted on the anus
Brought a chick on my right out stay whipping a Supra
Never watch the level (?)
You tryna touch the sky, I been sexin the clouds
You could die and go to heaven to see me once in a while
Wow[Intro]

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Jay Rock checking in, you niggas checking out
When I grip the pen, that's how it is when I'm on the mic
I'm the People's Choice
The streets never lie
I paid dues so I'm self made
And if you got something shitty to say
You get slept or slayed
Haters in the shade
They running they mouth
They steady talking till the gun in they mouth
Go ahead and chit chat
That's when you hear the click-clack then its all over
Too late to bleed, squeeze then flee, bleed the streets, bleed the beats
True story
I'm straight gutter, all guts
No glory
You niggas whack with them same raps
Y'all bore me
You're all killers and dealers
With scrilla like Kobe
Cut it out, you rappers papier-mache
K.Lamar my nigga, go ahead and take'em away

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I said we don't wanna hear that weak shit no more
My flow China white
Like a sheep in the snow
I go deep as the Bible, I could debate with the pope
And you rappers go down hill
Like a ski on the slope
I been a boat with Papi
But I ain't trying to cop no work
I'm trying to cop me the boat and some more property
I told Rock
"We gotta be more then just a commodity
Make the whole name and entity to infinity"
Y'all want me off the juice, no grenadine
Could stop me from thinking presidential like the scattered brains of Kennedy
After I shot, duck down
So the crowd won't witness me
Now, could somebody locate Mr. Shakur?
And tell these Tupacs, they two shots, away from two blocks
Of being neighbors with the Almighty Lord
I put your best material in, then fast forward
Kendrick, signing off
I'm sure your signature's forged, boy

[Verse 3: Schoolboy Q]
They say I'm headed to the county and they said it's for a murder
In a zone like a touchdown
No need to be turned down
Catch a fade, mandatory
Walk up in the dorm room just me and my heart
Let it start
Where you from?
I bang back
Start pushing back the rack
So I guess it's time to scrap
Run that, Look
I Whooped his ass for an hour
Made his nigga have to drag him in the shower
Survival techniques from the streets don't apply in here
Just barbarious niggas who'll try your fears, ruthless
Little church choir and Hell's fire
And lemme see you sing your ass out of this one
Smashed out a victim
Should've kept push ups in your routine
Eating tuna for your protein
Most niggas turn scary, fags get buried
Snatch a mothafucka's commissary
Dont worry I'm a gangster

[Verse 4: Ab-Soul]
Look
First name Herbert
Last name Steven
Don't call it my government
Cause I don't know none of them
As far as rap
I'm running it like I'm getting robbed
Target wasn't quite my target
That's why I quit my job
These niggas better hop on board
When my ship sets sail and I sell a few records
Sipping Guinness and set a few records
Enough is never enough
I gotta do extra
I gotta go the distance
I gotta prosper, I gotta put my mamacita
In that big casa
I gotta be the
Realest if not the illest to spit a verse
God MC, Pick a church
Hallelujah
Don't let the curly hair fool you
My hair ain't quite wool
And my feet ain't bronze
And it's inadequate thinking I used to run Nazareth
Imagine if this hoodie was a crown of thorns
You wish you had the stamina to go that hard
Get your punchlines up, then maybe we could spar
Your lyrics should make a point, then maybe we could score
Then maybe I could show you how three met-a-four
(Beat runs out)
Metaphorically speaking I'm more indecent
Then papa bear getting distracted enjoying his porridge, peep it
In a war, I rip a warrior to pieces
Make a Domino effect, like I'm delivering pizzas
(Kendrick:"Let him go, let him keep going")
And if that ain't a fact, then neither is Jesus
Black-lipped bastard
Puffing on a pasture
I hit a chick till she holla' like she caught the Holy Ghost
Then I passed her, holy smokes
I bring disaster to every quote
You a Shasta to a Coke
I'm a master
Sensei with a pen raised
Build up bricks, just to break
In the dojo blowing do-do
And to be frank
I'm so hot I make the snow flake
On any day
Ab-Soul, now you know mane

[Outro][Produced by Willie B]

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
This what you really want, huh
Turn me up, Ali

[Sample: Donny Hathaway]
I know your image of me
Is what I hope to be

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Black lip bastard, pass me your password
So I can hack inside your brain, see I, too, have gone insane
Before I fall, I'm sure to curse you all in Jesus' name
Lead shower, Anna Peebles hour, bitch, stand the rain

Look inside my parking garage and see a collage
Of every person I despise since the moment I turned five
Calculate my steps and strategically took my time
Even falling off, I land on the ass of Nicki Minaj (So soft)
Eat that pink pussy like it's Friday
Bust one, Roman Reload, then smoke to Sade
And somebody tell Rihanna too
I need that vagina too (Hey baby)
Don't fucking take me for some kind of fool
I'm kinda the reminder of knowing Compton ain't kinda cool
Good kid, mad city, mountaintops couldn't see my views
Countertops, we hop over, hit the register, then we move
I hope this shit can register on a regular soon
Before I climb this pedestal and make you catch my fucking stool, bitch
K.Dot, leave 'em grieving on evening news
Even when society break even, I'll break rules

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
I told niggas, caught wrecked, then I towed niggas
Fold niggas like clothes and drawers, nigga
Homie chose to go toe-to-toe, I had to break his leg
Like a cliché to rock a show, is that over your head?
Niggas stretching the truth like they choose to do yoga instead
Either that or that or they depressed, eating yogurt in bed
Solar system, grab a space shuttle and stay subtle
The bass bit the bait, I'm straight, you a gay couple
I ain't thirsty for the deal, way to make 'em pay double
Anxious when the bacon on the table, I need a muzzle
You're basic like cable to a satellite dish
You was running L.A., now you out of there like Fish
What more can I say? I'm a bastard with black lips
Black shirt, black shades, long black dick
I'm awkward, dog, I'm tryna bargain shop at Saks Fifth
Swung two axes and knocked the Earth off axis' ass

[Verse 3: Schoolboy Q]
Figg side, black nine, black lips, smoke time
Fuck this rap shit, I'm active
Sucking on titties since I was eight
Hoodie with my shades, I ain't tryna be fake
So don't be talking to me, pussy
Running your gums like you be Loc'ing
When the world know that you're nookie
Rookie, softer than infant fabric
I won't have it, when the gun drawn, get rat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tatted
Know my niggas moving
You hesitating to hit the lick, what the fuck is you doing?

[Verse 4: Ab-Soul]
Perpetrating, bitches popping Percocet and percolating
Freelance for God, but do the work of Satan, whatever works
I'm clever with the words, if you haven't noticed yet
Lightyears ahead, I'm bright and I like to get oral sex
Soul brother number 1+1, getting fed like where drugs and guns come from

[Verse 5: Jay Rock]
All we do is do it, shitting on the competition
Taking heads off, this Hannibal Lecter music
You niggas don't move me, you niggas just movies
Cut straight to them credits and hit you wit' a Uzi
Peel off in a dullies, truck bed full of toolies
Get home, smoke, poke on some coochie
I'm just fucking around, enough with them fairy tales
But I bust heads for real, go head
I'm Jay Rock, you lil niggas beneath me
How you gon' dance with the devil with two left feet?
Peep, thinking you sweet, but you weak
Talking out of turn'll leave all of your teeth in the street
Momma taught you better, never clash with a giant
Unless you David, remember, my nigga, I'm not Goliath
Feel the wrath of this titan, hit some water, call it Poseidon
Wig out, then hit your ass with a trident
Money on the table, my nigga, you know I'm all in
If rap was a drink, you wine, nigga, I'm all gin
Hunnit proof, recruit a hunnit troops who love to shoot
No fluke, my nigga, you know that's what us hunters do
East side up, Watt City mayhem
Choppers, they spraying from A.M. to P.M
I'm the silent assassin of the four-headed dragon
Black Hippy blasting a .50 out the back of the Benz Wagon
Toe-tagging wack rappers off G.P
You can't see me, your vision ain't 3D
You smoking on that seaweed, we rolling up that kiwi
In the backwood lighting, we high for like three weeks
You paying for that pussy, but we always get freebies
Top Dawg that ho and throw it like a frisbee, it's history
You know the night and day is ours
Top Dawg conglomerate, Hiii Power, bitch!

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
Is this what y'all really want?
This Black Hippy shit what y'all really want?
When I'm in interviews, don't ask me 'bout no crews
No posses, no cliques, don't tell me who's gettin' it
I don't give a fuck, nigga
I just paid-- I just paid six figures in taxes, nigga
I'm rich daily, on some independent shit
Uncle Sam talking 'bout [?]
I'm like "Nigga, fuck you!"
K-Dot said it, not Kendrick
Ab-Soul got us stuck on the planet, nigga
T.D.E., solar system, Control System, bee-otch![Intro]

[Verse: Jay Rock]
It's Jay Rock, born in the heart of [?] this spittin'
And my bars hit harder than car collisions
My hands still hurt from all that pitchin
I'm still bitching for your dough, like Robin Givens
The Lebron of ours, so I was built for balling
You lazy ass niggas y'all was built for stalling
I'm still standing tall you can't knock me down
I ain't got a lot of weight but I'm packing pounds, get it?
(My name's Jay Rock I'm the man in the streets
If you need that work come holla at me)
Give me some green and give me some white
It's hard times so a nigga might double the price
I'm starving, got damn pockets to feed
On the mic spitting flows 800 degrees
I'm a hustler, nigga, yes I love the grind
Call me Busta, nigga, yes I love to rhyme
Yeah my hand never shaking when I'm holding a nine
Clutch game crazy, like Bird in his prime, nigga
(In these streets gotta carry your clips
If not your a dead ass son of a bitch)
I'm holding more K's than the Ku Klux Klan
You want a head up, you don't wanna see my hands, nigga
Got a jab like Judah that's no lie
Let four fly, all black blowflies
I'm from the projects don't get it twisted
Talking sideways you gon come up missing
Laid back in the truck, rolling up a Swisher
Dot in the back, tea bagged me a sister
(Yeah I'm from Watts and I rep the bricks
If you run your lip, we gon bust your shit)
You could catch Jay Rock on some gangsta shit
On the block with a chain and a [?]  to spit
In the hood with some good [?] pound of twigs
Rifles, plenty rounds got box of clips
I'm a project nigga I'll box ya [?]
I'm like pills in the club, I'll pop ya quick
Yeah that rhyme so sick I spit toxic shit
Yeah that flow so golden like a bottle of piss
(It's T-O-P D-A-W-G
It's the new West Coast and we run these streets)
There's no more drive-bys niggas do walk-ups
Spark stuff, leavin' bodies all chopped up
I got nines and a couple of Macs
That'll split a couple of heads and push shit back
I'm from the land where they push that crack
On Compton Ave., all the hoes yeah they sell that ash
You got money go and show your stash
But don't show your ass
Cause these killers they'll show no blast, nigga[Verse 1]
I'm Jay muthafuckin' Rock nigga, what it do?
All red chucks yellin' out "SU-WOOP!"
Known by them niggas that be wearin' all blue
That's why I get a pass everytime I ride through
Eastside bounty hunter Watts that's my clique
Nickerson Gardens, nigga you know the bricks
Nine double 0 five nine you know the zip
Top Dawg light it up we just gave 'em another hit

[Hook]
Cause I'm a blood nigga, red rag until I die
See the brims, see the RU's yeah you know we certified
I'm a blood nigga, damu's on the ride
Flamed up across the globe, yeah you know we worldwide
I'm a blood nigga, when you see me better give it up
None but a B thang, homie we don't give a fuck
I'm a blood nigga, haters tryna shut us out the door
Get yo walk on but I'mma keep it blood tho

[Verse 2]
I'm a blood nigga, all red bandana
With my Juelz on but I'm not Santana
I'm a blood nigga, just bicking back being bool
Cut off khakis, braids and house shoes
I'm a blood nigga, heavy thang to my right
Can't correct me when I'm wrong, when I'm wrong, blood I'm right
I'm a blood nigga, I'm the realest nothin' nice
When it's beef then it's on, I'm takin' off right on sight

[Hook]

[Outro]

N.Y., where my blood niggas?
