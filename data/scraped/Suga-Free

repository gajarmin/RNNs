[Intro]
Got a sack of marijuana, think I'm 'bout to bend a corner
Ain't no telling who my money for
Got my dope from cross the border
Got my home on Figueroa, ain't no telling where that pussy go

[Hook]
Will you sell that pussy for me?
Will you sell that pussy for me? (Will you sell that pussy for me?)
Will you sell that pussy for me?
Will you sell that pussy for me? (Will you sell that pussy for me?)

[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
Check the forecast, it's Wavy Q, I should make the news
My fortune said that I'll be pimping you and your pussy juice
Super sweet, sell a trick a treat, hope your lips in shape
Cause you worked your feet as you stroll them streets, beeper checking
Hope no cops arresting, girl, I told you them narcs be pressing
Better act like you a pedestrian and don't mention my name
My pimping is game, cold limp with my cane, got gold on my chain
Come pinky my ring, it's so blickety bling
On 51st and Figg, grew up about ten minutes from the real Ricky
Where the shoelaces is orange with H hats like we from Houston
Condoms in hoes' purses with baby wipes for they coochie
You's a ho that's selling booty, no need to be acting bougie
Bitch, I give your ass a noogie and a chicken nugget
And make you watch me at the movies, I'm panoramic
My filming be rated pimping, my mink dragging
With two bitches that go and get it, my hoes get it

[Hook]

[Bridge 2x]
Hut one, hut two
Hut three, hut four (Sell that pussy for me)
Will you sell that pussy for me?
Will you sell that pussy for me? (Will you sell that pussy for me?)

[Interlude: Suga Free]
I ain't asking, I'm telling you, bitch

[Verse 2: Suga Free]
Uh-huh, yeah, watch me go Black Forest ham
A new school player laced with the old gift gab
And don't let your Shark Week mouth override your Green Goldfish ass
So for every ho you clown, I'mma crown two
And anything good hurts and I cried
Shit I just don't want to throw it up in my mothafuckin' face
Or I choose to not do this around you
See ho you like a brain aneurysm
Want two heads with the same dandruff in 'em
Only to scratch the itch with baby rattlesnake fangs
No Head and Shoulders or anti-venom
Yeah, P, this is gentlemanly leisure, the oldest game left to play
And the hard head that make a soft ass played out
Will forgive and forget yesterday
Now get 'em, Q, a pimp on foot, go to sleep carless, wake up to a Cadillac
Remember Forrest Gump walked and he was pretty stupid
So you know what? Accept the fact that the bitch belongs to the world
P, cause that ho only yours as long as she hoeing
But Happy Pimping and Merry Ho Ho
Keep an eye on bottom bitch too
Cause that bitch'll run a ho or two off, mane
Pimps only fuck with pimps, homie, that's why we so solid
Red to blue, to debt, to due, it's easier
To put a watermelon through the eye of a needle
This is done by choice, not by force
I ain't asking, I'm telling you

[Hook: SZA]

[Outro: Suga Free]
She gon' choose
Man that ho gon' work hard for you, jack

Gimme this, gimme that, do you got, can I have

Lay there, please don't move baby
On me, don't you stop
Doggy, comin through baby
Watch me hit the spot
You make me wanna speak Spanish
You make me wanna be manish
Nothing could compare to the way we keep it hot
Strawberries soakin in amaretto out in the limo
Be spitty, got the car lookin pretty, in the window
Lets hit the indo
Commit a sin in this crescendo
Smoky, foggy
Take off your coat, lets hit the doggy
Pull out your scrunchie, let me play through your mane
Long, brown, nice and round, explorin my brain
Selective and picky when we get wet and get sticky
In and out, without a clue, not even a hickey
Love it or leave it, addictive like crystal to meth
And it's hard to let go of me when I shift to the left
Never like what you're happy for, I'm more than a man
I can even make you feel me when you're usin your hand
I'm confident, like an MVP
Got the key to the CPT
Lookin for a G like me
She F-E-M-A-L-E
Where you be at?
True love only can be that
I'm tellin you that you the shit
Call me when you get this hit

(Chorus 1: DJ Quik)
Do I love her, do I need her? (Suga Free: nuh uh)
Do I take my money out and feed her? (no, no)
And should I treat her (no, no) like no other? (nah)
I don't know I think I need to ask my brother Suga Free
(Chorus 1: Suga Free)
Do I love her? (uh huh)
Do I need her? (Oh, yeah)
And when she tells me she loves me, I don't believe her (yeah, you do)
No I don't love her, (mmm hmm)
And I don't need her (Yeah, yeah)
And if she don't give me me money I'm a leave her

(verse 2)
See baby, I got a spot to fill
And all that callin me out my name gonna have you
Runnin down the street barefooted again sayin "not for real!"
And how you gonna blame mine?
Dawon and Suga Free the same person
But you will never catch me and him in the same room at the same time
Baby, you not yo best, I called you
Cuz I was broke, hoeless, and short on these little ends
And it wasn't for no sex
I see you still messin wit yo phony ballers
But when they tired of you
You run yo lil ass right back over here beggin me for 20 dollars
And mighty funny (mighty funny)
You get nice than a mug with them hugs, actin like you in love
With a nigga, when you love money
What? you stuck?
Ho, if I tell yo flea to pull a tree
You get a chain and hook his lil ass up
Quik'll give you a piece of his planet
But I'll give you a dirt rock
Half a low quat
Not a dope spot
Nor a piece of this pomegranet
Baby wanna eat-eat?
Cuz Suga Free-Free
Will go gleek-gleek
And tweak-tweak
And put yo all to sleep-sleep
Ooh, I'm a tell (I'm a tell)
Suga Free pop a beat and spit a rap so swell
She said, "suga free, you know anything about cars, honey?"
I said, yeah, you fill em up with hoes
Take em to the ho stro'
So they can get that money!

(Chorus 2: DJ Quik)
Do I love her do I need her? (suga free: uh uh)
Do I take my money out and feed her? (no way)
And do I treat her (no) like no other (man)
I don't know I think I need to ask my brother suga free
(Chorus 2: Suga Free)
Aah, do I love her do I need her? (DJ Quik: Oh, yeah)
And when she tell me she love me I don't believe her (yea you do)
Do I love her? (mmm hmm) Do I need her? (fo sho)
Leave me 'lone, leave me 'lone, Devil be gone! I'm leaving (yeah)

(DJ Quik, talking)
See, that's what y'all get for underestimatin me and Suga Free
We told y'all we was magical, way back in 1996
But y'all didn't feel that. Y'all chose to sleep on us
Baby, we so powerful, we can make the rain stop (Rain, ne me nome)
You feel that?

(Chorus 3: DJ Quik)
Do I love her, do I need her?
Do I take my money out and feed her?
And do I treat her (mmm mmm) like no other? (naw)
I don't know, I think I need to ask my brother Suga Free
(Chorus 3: Suga Free)
Ooh, do I love her, Do I need her? (DJ Quik: mmm hmm)
And when she tell me she love me I don't believe her (yeah, you do)
Now do I love her (mmm hmm) or care about her (you should)
You ne me nome, ne me nome, fore I lock you in that box again

(DJ Quik)
Do I love her do I need her? (Box again)
Do I take my money out and feed her? (ne me nome!)
And do I treat her a-like no other? (yaah!)
I don't know I think I need to ask my brother Suga Free

(Suga Free)
Ooh, do I love her, do I need her? (sure do)
And when she tell me she love me I don't believe her (she need you too)
And do I love her (mmm hmm) or care about her? (you outta)
You ne me nome, leave me alone, before I lock you in that box again

(DJ Quik)
Do I love her do I need her? (Box again)
Do I take my money out and feed her? (Box again!)
And do I treat her a-like no other?

(Suga Free)
Ne me nomeHahhhhhhh, yeah, ha ha
It's the {?} free

Hundred spoke music, yeah, uhh

[Hi-C]
I put humps in they back like a Halloween pumpkin cat
Just shut up, and bounce to the track
What'chu thank?  I won't peel paint for my bank?
Better look out, hand me my strap
Now just like I thought you don't want no funk
Better listen to your homeboy tellin you don't
Just put your hands on your hip, let your backbone slip
All my dogs in the riffs y'all skip
Ain't no set trippin but we givin it up
California love straight livin it up
Palm trees bendin, chrome wheels spinnin
Corona and lemon, got us all sinnin
Big booty women, sinnin and grinnin
I can't change the game I'm in the 9th inning
Just hit the dancefloor but get yours on
Like uh, heyyy, that's my song

[Chorus - repeat 2X]
Say woop - WOOP
Say woop woop - WOOP WOOP
Wo-woop wo-woo-woop, wo-woop wo-woo-woop
Wo-woop wo-woo-woop!  Wo-woop wo-woo-woop!

[Hi-C]
They say Hi-C what's up?
Man shit, dick in dynamite and all I can't fuck
I'ma blow up, y'all niggas better slow up
Jumpin out of line with us, 'll get your whole ass to' up
I gives a fuck what you throw up
All I'm tryin to do is watch Hi-Life blow up
But you trippin off that lil' pimpin
I'll bust you in your mouth and have your suit sippin
Quik did it, yep and I'ma spit it
You bootlegger motherfuckers y'all need to quit it
Don't nothin turn me on like a women, that spit it
So go buy you some clothes and hair to go with it
All I need is a drink or two
And bout 8 or 9 million in my juicy boo
Just hit the dancefloor but get yours on
Like uh, heyyy, that's my song

[Chorus]

[Suga Free]
Talkin bout y'all crackin a whip
What happened to the chair man?
Y'all done left the chair?
Sometimes!

I got the chair and the whip cause she out of pocket, she wrong
Plus I'm off that shit Hitler gave them Nazis, now it's on
Whatchu think I'm Superpimp ain't got no feelings hurt don't beef
What I'm a robot with no problems pimp on Sesame Street?
Sometimes I need me a lil' somethin, it ain't no smoke either
And when them white boys cook it man I mean ephedrine ain't ether
Made me feel like Dirk Diggler, super fucker
Post a bitch on this dick do it to her coochie rougher
Eyes wide, heart beatin, hand around her throat, pullin her hair
Slapped her up like a rapist do the stankin everywhere
Don't push me homey, I've been up for 3 days, short tempered
Can't eat nothin and my wave stank cause I got a lil' pussy on it
Cranium, connected to my, membrane
My membrane connected to my, esopha-garus
Drip, drip, drop, drop
Gleep gleep, tweak tweak, Laneway to the top

[Chorus]So pay attention, babe
Pay attention
Our Father, who art in Heaven
Quik gave me a beat, now Pomona's on the set, now...

Chorus:
Get your money, why you bullshittin'?!
Baby, why you bullshittin'?!

Mama tries but there ain't no love like homie love, baby
I'm G'd up and I'm crazy
And there's a mellow ghetto breeze on my ass
Cause I'm, saggin', don't wanna die so I'm packin''
Now when I see my baby cryin'
I can't explain how it hits me
I'm tryin' to take responsibility
Ya see in order for me to win, I gotta lose sometimes, baby
I know I'm wrong but I'mma make it
Now I...

Never hit hit a woman, naha
But I'll slap the shit out of a bitch, why you bullshittin'?!
If you think with a little head, you gets a little head, little trick
But I ain't goin' against the grain, not me, not even a little bit
Bet she didn't tell you she used to be my ho, huh?
Yeah nigga, she sold that pussy for me, in Pomona
You better take some of this night time sticky icky head
'Fore she could realise I'm tryin' to get rich with Quik
Why you bullshittin' medicine, nigga
Suga Free is lovely and pretty as I can be
Perms silkier than Charlotte's Web, waves deep as Redondo Beach
Tellin' you to

Chorus:
Get your money, why you bullshittin'?!
Baby, why you bullshittin'?!
I get down, why you bullshittin'?!
Baby, why you bullshittin'?!

Now what's the problem nigga?
Whu-what? Yo' lady won't suck your dick?
Cause for the very low low price of $100 you can use my bitch
And if you act now, man, I'll throw in a ho that'll buff your knob
She used to work down there at the Sperm Bank
See, she got fired for drinkin' on the job
But you ain't know, givin' baby yo' money, be killin' me!
Lettin' that bitch disrespect you in front of yo' friends be killin me!
Always givin' that bitch some dick, killin' me
Goin' through one ear, comin' out the other
Talkin bout you feelin' me
Now, partner tell me where my love at
Cause I'mma tell you where you're wrong at
I'll bend but I won't break, not me, no matter
I’m broker than the ten commandments
Plus I just walked a ho in some Stacey Adams
Shit! And at that you broke, been broke, gon' be broke
Wanna see me broke, but please ho, really doe
Cause I’ll tell a lie, she’ll tell a lie
Then we’ll sit there with a straight face
And compliment each other on one another’s lie
Now I can tell you 30 times how to pimp you a ho
And I can tell you 30 mo' and you still won't know
Partner, you wanna overuse the pussy?
Me, I'm tryin' to hit the news with the pussy
In a survey it's estimated that 9 out of 10 men don't check they spouse
But Suga Free'll tell your pretty ass to get the fuck out!

Chorus:
And get my money, why you bullshittin'?!
Baby, why you bullshittin'?!
I get down, why you bullshittin'?!
Baby, why you bullshittin'?!

Bitch come get yo' damn kid, you see him tearin' up my shit?
She's starin' dead at they ass, you won't tell 'em to quit
Now, I whoop they ass, fuck waitin' 'till baby turn her back
Lil ol' man come sock me, trust me
He tryin' to run, he gettin' cracked
I want you but I really don't need you, bitch
Cause all you do is eat, burp and fuck and talk that shit
And tell yo' kids I ain't they motherfuckin' daddy
What-what? Yo' medicaid expired?
Cause they look like they been eatin' cabbage
And it don't cost a dime
I won't knock one pork chop off yo' plate
If you don't knock one of mine, yeah, this's pimpin' partna
Cause a hoes gonna be a ho for real
Quit jockin' her cause youse a snack, she lookin' for a meal
And I ain't tryin' to be your friend bitch
Buddy, buddy, thats my partner, that nigga cool, and all that shit
Sayin: I won't be afraid, I won't go astray
I pay like I weigh, I'll stay in my place
Please let me stay, A ho to my grave
So how you wanna handle this? Baby we'll dismantle this
And we blows you out like a candle trick
Hahahahahahaa
And we blows you out like a candle trick

Chorus:
Man, get your money, why you bullshittin'?!
Baby, why you bullshittin'?!
Believe me, I get down, why you bullshittin'?!

Chorus:

Mama tries but there ain't no love like homie love, baby

Cause I'm, saggin', don't wanna die so I'm taggin'
Now when I see my baby cryin'

I'm tryin' papers while she fill it in
Ya see in order for me to win, I gotta lose sometimes, baby
I know I'm wrong but I'ma make it

Verse 1
Never hit hit a woman, naha

Bit

Ahhhh, I get down for life, oh!Quik:
My name is Quik & I be moving fast like a race car
But I'm top seed #1 like the pace car
Whether you up on me or you chillin' way far
You can tell almost immediately that I'm aced off
So listen muthafucka why you comin' off hard
My objective is to catch you off guard
Get covert & infiltrate yo' clique
Crack yo' shit & mack yo' bitch
Now tell me could you conceive a nigga all up in her beaver
Givin' her the love fever for hours at a time before I take a breather
And when she tell me she loves me I don't believe her
Cause I rock in stereo or mono hot like gonno-
Rhea burnin' everytime you take a pee uh
So when you see a nigga out with his girl
Then baby play like you don't know me & we'll keep in a twirl
Because baby I go deeper than the deep blue seas
Baby do you really wanna play the flute on me?
I'll give you a sack & take it back & you'll die to get it
Little punk cause I'm fly with it

Chorus
When we come up we gettin' down down down
Step in the club they give us pound pound pound
Lookin' for somethin' that be nice brown & round
DJ Quik & AMG with a brand new sound
(repeat)

AMG:
I told her don't chase it but you can place it
In between your jaws to taste it
Or leave it in the basement
I be the riddler that's too familiar get in the middle of ya
And then I diddle ya, dick ya down 'til it tickles
Smack the booty with no pimples
Caress ya back then rub ya nipples
Baby I'm a crack fiend get the KY & if I'm at a jiggalo
Baby say hi fly like a eagle in a Range Rover or a Regal
Lookin' for the party people & when I catch ya baby girl
You should feel lucky we can make love
But don't forget to fuck me
Cause you got more bounce than Roger Troutman
I don't know when it's in or out and
Soak me baby give me that good thang
Ain't nothin' wrong with a coochie bang
Cause Suga Free, Mausberg, Quik & the AM
Definitely knows how to play 'em
Cause we went from demos to limos to luxuriousies
To models from Milan on they knees

Chorus
When we come up we gettin' down down down
Step in the club they give us pound pound pound
Lookin' for somethin' that be nice brown & round
AMG & Mausberg with a brand new sound
(repeat)

Mausberg:
Oh you didn't know that I'm the bomb baby
Well take a toke of this D-I- & you gon' be feelin' flizie
Cause I be's Mausberg the superior
Steppin' through the club pound pound so ya fearin' us
But don't trip we keep the vibe right
Baby buy me some Remy & if
Yo' baby daddy trippin' tell him beep me
Cause I be's Black & Tone & swift up on my toes
G'd up in alligate's and black steel toes
Can I get a pound pound? (pound pound)
If Free the flyest who am I? (You the realest)
Look into my eyes & tell me what do you see
Oh you jockin' my entourage DJ Quik & AMG
Well get yo' groove on cause I ain't hatin' on the homies
When that 9-5th drop you & yo' sister gon' be on me
All I wanna do is slide up in & slide back out
Slap you in yo' face & stick it dead in yo' mouth
You think I'm bullshittin' well meet me after my show
Bring yo' lips to that all white stretch limo
So we can ride, slide, dip & glide Booyah!
And do our thang cause my whole clique fly

Chorus
When we come up we gettin' down down down
Step in the club they give us pound pound pound
Lookin' for somethin' that be nice brown & round
Mausberg & Suga Free with a brand new sound
(repeat)

Suga Free:
It feel good don't it?
It ain't no good if it ain't good enough
To put the proper hood on it
Peep how I struck up bitch jump in the air
Stay there until I tell you come down
& when you do you shut the fuck up
She'll sell a nice dream but bitch you'll
Have better luck tryin' to find 2 Pac than
Me buying you somethin' off the ice cream truck
Oxygen you leave 'lone leave me 'lone
Before I lock you in that little bitty box again
Don't let up y'all just keep her soakin' wet up
Playa playa & tell her when she need to shut up
Don't lighten up naw nigga you better you better tighten up
Throw ya head back back back back
Lean it to the side hey playas (Yeah!)
Tell 'em that we fly (We fly!) Ooooh catastrophe!
Bitch rather slide down a slide of razor blades
Into a pool of pimp piss but this ho had the audacity
To ask me for a dollar even though that's all I had left
These greedy lying ass hoes'll fifty cents yo' ass to death!

Chorus
When we come up we gettin' down down down
Step in the club they give us pound pound pound
Lookin' for somethin' that be nice brown & round
And we come to hit the world with a brand new sound
(repeat)[Suga Free]
No. No. The name stays on
The name's got my daddy's blood on it
The name stays on. ... got my daddy's blood on it
The name stays on. She can have half of it

[Dj Quik]
I'm a give a hand gesture
The one that I make
When I give my thumb and other three fingers a break
You get the One
No, It's not random, it's not a mistake
You get the One, yeah

[Tweed Cadillac]
Man, ya'll rap cats funny
I'm Fred G. Sanford, ya'll big ole dummies
And I ain't about to spit up on your verse
If you can't pull a little somethin' somethin'
Out your purse
I'm a vet, not a pet
So Cal Intellect, grants me a much fatter check
So, oh shit! I'm back up in the booth again
This time no looky loos gettin' in
Please. See ain't no reasonin'
Your bland. Your pimpin' needs seasonin'
I'm one of the best from the West (Tweed Cadillac Baby!)
My name's still tatted on my Ex-wife's chest
And I don't have Jungle Fever
Neither do I need a rapper rapping with me either
Ya best realize who you're dealing with
I'm on some 93 point Tweed Cadillac

[Chorus]
I don't understand ya'll niggas
And I know ya'll don't understand me
But if I have to clown ya'll niggas
Just to light a little fire
Well I guess that's just what it's gonna have to be
Yah see, I don't comprehend ya'll suckas
Opinionated, you're dumb and OG
You couldn't keep up with the city
So you moved out to the desert
And you want to blame your drama on me
Keep it Broken Down

[Suga Free]
You see the gift
Now find the gab
To each it's reach
If I don't cop, it ain't mine to have
I'm tryin' to be as clean as a ?
But in the back of my mind, I'm like get the fuck away from me
Why do you want to try to stress a muthafucka?
If I throw you a P at you, nigga, catch the muthafucka
Here's the dearly and there's the departed
The only time I like to fuck you
Is when I'm off that narcotic
You know I'm no good
I get my money in the hood
Tattoo

[Quik]
Oh yeah

[Suga Free]
Hey Quik! Blow a trick out
Ain't it fucked up when a bitch coughs while your fucking and spits your dick out?

[Quik]
Money

[Suga Free]
Give me more. Aye Quik I'm serious
Ain't that the same nigga that choked a bitch out with a gray unicorn?
Holy fish scale!
You mean to tell me, you'd rather save this bitch than save this whale?
It's mighty skeptical
Quik, all these years and you ain't gave me a Pee. ...Nah, I'm talkin' about the vegetable
And she knows it's me when I'm pullin' up
Cuz my car goes Vroom Vroom
And her daddy's easy to talk to because the whole conversation be Um-hmm
Now buckle down for the backlash
Why they call Dj Quik Dj Quik? ... that fast!

[Chorus]
I don't understand ya'll niggas
And I know ya'll don't understand me
But if I have to clown ya'll niggas
Just to light a little fire
Well I guess that's just what it's gonna have to be
Yah see, I don't comprehend ya'll suckas
Opinionated, you're dumb and OG
You couldn't keep up with the city
So you moved out to the desert
And you want to blame your drama on me
Keep it Broken Down

[Dj Quik]
You niggas buyin' Meth, I'm buyin' cookware
I'm tired of being a muthafuckin' pall-bearer
I think I'd rather be Geraldo Rivera
And tell the people what's really going on with you squares
How could I lose my identity?
How could we become our own worst enemy?
Even at the park, we don't party whatever
Not familiar, because we are hardly together
Cyber gangbangers, Internet gimmicks
How did all my fans get replaced with critics?
Went to sleep and woke up in a world full of limits
And being humble is synonomous with being timid
Niggas annoy me, so I frighten them
They stalk and hunt me down, 'til I enlighten them
And then they sex play me, sounding fruity
When you call me bitch ass nigga
Is that a female dog shaped booty?

[Chorus]
I don't understand ya'll niggas
And I know ya'll don't understand me
But if I have to clown ya'll niggas
Just to light a little fire
Well I guess that's just what it's gonna have to be
Yah see, I don't comprehend ya'll suckas
Opinionated, you're dumb and OG
You couldn't keep up with the city
So you moved out to the desert
And you want to blame your drama on me
Keep it Broken Down[Intro]
Man, this is some different shit
Fucked around and hooked up with Morris and them
Hit ‘em up, Free
Jerome and them. Niggas cooler than a muthafucka. Kool and them

[Verse 1]
Hey, can I tell you something? Something I don’t tell?
What got me feeling like a pimp and make me grow these nails?
I think it’s something in my bones that be making me feel
That I can walk and I can talk like a player, for real
Sometimes I get the urge to jump around and act the fool
‘cause a player be so happy he don’t know what to do!
I mean, some way, somewhere there’s a girl
That was meant for you, and homey, she will give you the world
She want to see with my nails done and I do, too
Perhaps a manicure to help a pimp to feel real cool
Now, none of y’all tricks can’t tell me nothing
I got my hair fresh blowing in the wind for something
Wearing tailor-made shit and my cleaners know
Put your contraband in a bag and hide my smoke
Yeah, I’m so cool (so cool), you can tell by my walk
That I ain’t really got no time to talk

[Hook]
Hey, fellas! (Yeah?)
Any y’all hot? (No!)
You know why? (Why?)
‘Cause we cool. (Cool.)
Hey, fellas! (Yeah?)
Any y’all hot? (No!)
You know why? (Why?)
We so cool. So freeze, cool
(sung) P-I-M-P
What’s that spell?
(sung) P-I-M-P
That spells, “pimp” (Pimp!)

[Verse 2]
Have you had your sex today? Was it good?
Did he do it like a pimp, just like he should?
Or did he get on one knee and try to give you a ring
So he could lock you in the house and handcuff your dreams?
Hell, no. She ain’t going out like that
She want to hit the casino in Las Vegas for a mack
And her eyes get big every time she hit
While you sitting there wanting to lay around with the bitch
Get your money, man, (Pimp!) and tell her all your needs
Do what you tell her you’re going to do because she just might leave
But you ready for the cop and blow? (what?)
‘Cause you’s a player you going to get you some mo’
Now you messing with some check books, credit cards, mo’ mon-ey
And looking back you squares, that’s so fun-ny
I drive a Cadillac, baby, don’t touch my glass
Take your shoes off, set them down, and drop my cash

[Hook]
(sung) P-I-M-P
What’s that spell?
(sung) P-I-M-P
Ah th-that, ah th-that spells, “pimp” (Pimp!)

[Verse 3]
Now she got a baby, five minutes of fame
And the next thing you know, the baby got your name
Now she’s Wonder Woman, dogg, she don’t need no man
She got a helpless little baby in the palm of her hand
And her mama don’t make it no better side-busting
But I’m going to make it fly, better side-hustling
She can’t stand how I tell the truth
She can’t stand how I’m rolling with you
She can’t stand how I do what I do
But you better understand the pimp game is true
I ain’t lying about something so I can do something else
Think you need some time alone so you can play with yourself
I’m too cool – like the Fonz again:
Finger nails, to the hair, to the skin I’m in
I’m too cool – square girls can’t tell, right?
One more time and you going to hell!

[Long outro]Chorus:
Smokin' on that doe doe and a skunk
As I bump with the humps in the trunk
I'm sippin' on that Hennesey because it's all good
As I bounce to a party in the hood
(x2)

Verse 1:

[Suga Free]
Slide, slide, slippety slide
Because I heard it was a party jumpin' on the Westside
Ride, Dogg, show me your eyes
So I'mma drink this Hennesey and give my head a real drive
Now the rat-tat-tat-tat strapped on my back-back
Nothin' jacked but the cracker playa hater talkin' smack
Cause the party that I'm headed fo' is oh so deep
And it's a Tony Lane thang so I'm bound to creep
Now Suga Free don't dance, but I'd like to now
And my hoes can't go until my money is right
Now I'm about to get go after I G up from the feet up
And roll this weed up, like ?, speed up with the beat up
And roll. Baby hold that stearin wheel while I roll this indo
Better known as the magic wand, the bomb, the antidote
The twilight smoker, 'fore smoke
As I swerve by the curb on some herb gettin' smoked
Hittin' 16 switches is the life
While your girl send you to players anonymous, I perform like the Macs
I sell a dream to her like a quiet storm
The only reason why baby wear panties is to keep her ankles warm
As I tip top out the Cadillac
I see my homie DJ Quik and Tony Lane with that sticky green thang

[?Tony Lane?]
?? up in a planatary temper high
Tryin' to prevent a player from gettin' his pie, so let me fly

Chorus

Verse 2:

[Suga Free]
Sway, as I begin to hit the Chronic I see birds
I'm paranoid but I still want that herb
Somebody ??? cause my cotton mouth is back but I'm feelin' superb
I'm in la-la land and I'm tweaky
I'm in la-la land, but I see these girls freaky
I'm in la-la land, time to start creepin'
One two three, I emerge as a G
The Chronic got my membrane stuck
I'm Suga Free and I don't give a huff
And my eyes are oh so loaded
That I can barely focus in on my folks
Sway, it's reserve, as I tip-toe
Slip and slide to the flow where the ?heatho?
Really though, here we go ho
Foe everytime I look around I see hoes
So many different freaks to be chose
So what you sayin'? What you sayin'?
Spit that game and bust these hoes
?? caught me for a dog, how?
Got you niggas slippin' with this freak in, bow wow
That ? was to, her skirt got hooked, her man got shook
Cause that's the way it's written down in a players book
To a bitch thinkin' just like blue
Don't let her bounce off me, so we can stick on you
Now if you got a sack of weed say "Right, right"
Now hold it up and wave it from side to side
Cause your party ain't a party if you ain't got weed
Woman cloud and contact smoke that I can book breath
Yeah I can feel my heart beat
It's Suga Free, come take this weed from me
And something's wrong, I think I'm sprung, off of that twee.. Suga Free
And I feel so high, my mouth is dry
But I wanna fly in the sky and say goodbye as I rise
Seems.. As I take a deep breath from that boo-boo AKA the chronic
Not that boo-bop that you got
Seperate mine from yours, fool, I want the pie
That every other bud head do
The certain general has just informed you and I
To inhale and exhale, to breathale my bale well

Chorus 4x

Smokin on that doe doe and a skunk...(DJ Quik)
Lay there, please don't move baby
On me, don't you stop
Doggy, comin through baby
Watch me hit the spot
You make me wanna speak Spanish
You make me wanna be manish
Nothing could compare to the way we keep it hot
Strawberries soakin in amaretto out in the limo
Be spitty, got the car lookin pretty, in the window
Lets hit the indo
Commit a sin in this crescendo
Smoky, foggy
Take off your coat, lets hit the doggy
Pull out your scrunchie, let me play through your mane
Long, brown, nice and round, explorin my brain
Selective and picky when we get wet and get sticky
In and out, without a clue, not even a hickey
Love it or leave it, addictive like crystal to meth
And it's hard to let go of me when I shift to the left
Never like what you're happy for, I'm more than a man
I can even make you feel me when you're usin your hand
I'm confident, like an MVP
Got the key to the CPT
Lookin for a G like me
She F-E-M-A-L-E
Where you be at?
True love only can be that
I'm tellin you that you the shit
Call me when you get this hit

(Chorus 1: DJ Quik)
Do I love her, do I need her? (Suga Free: nuh uh)
Do I take my money out and feed her? (no, no)
And should I treat her (no, no) like no other? (nah)
I don't know I think I need to ask my brother Suga Free
(Chorus 1: Suga Free)
Do I love her? (uh huh)
Do I need her? (Oh, yeah)
And when she tells me she loves me, I don't believe her (yeah, you do)
No I don't love her, (mmm hmm)
And I don't need her (Yeah, yeah)
And if she don't give me me money I'm a leave her

(verse 2)
See baby, I got a spot to fill
And all that callin me out my name gonna have you
Runnin down the street barefooted again sayin "not for real!"
And how you gonna blame mine?
Dawon and Suga Free the same person
But you will never catch me and him in the same room at the same time
Baby, you not yo best, I called you
Cuz I was broke, hoeless, and short on these little ends
And it wasn't for no sex
I see you still messin wit yo phony ballers
But when they tired of you
You run yo lil ass right back over here beggin me for 20 dollars
And mighty funny (mighty funny)
You get nice than a mug with them hugs, actin like you in love
With a nigga, when you love money
What? you stuck?
Ho, if I tell yo flea to pull a tree
You get a chain and hook his lil ass up
Quik'll give you a piece of his planet
But I'll give you a dirt rock
Half a low quat
Not a dope spot
Nor a piece of this pomegranet
Baby wanna eat-eat?
Cuz Suga Free-Free
Will go gleek-gleek
And tweak-tweak
And put yo all to sleep-sleep
Ooh, I'm a tell (I'm a tell)
Suga Free pop a beat and spit a rap so swell
She said, "suga free, you know anything about cars, honey?"
I said, yeah, you fill em up with hoes
Take em to the ho stro'
So they can get that money!

(Chorus 2: DJ Quik)
Do I love her do I need her? (suga free: uh uh)
Do I take my money out and feed her? (no way)
And do I treat her (no) like no other (man)
I don't know I think I need to ask my brother suga free
(Chorus 2: Suga Free)
Aah, do I love her do I need her? (DJ Quik: Oh, yeah)
And when she tell me she love me I don't believe her (yea you do)
Do I love her? (mmm hmm) Do I need her? (fo sho)
Leave me 'lone, leave me 'lone, Devil be gone! I'm leaving (yeah)

(DJ Quik, talking)
See, that's what y'all get for underestimatin me and Suga Free
We told y'all we was magical, way back in 1996
But y'all didn't feel that. Y'all chose to sleep on us
Baby, we so powerful, we can make the rain stop (Rain, ne me nome)
You feel that?

(Chorus 3: DJ Quik)
Do I love her, do I need her?
Do I take my money out and feed her?
And do I treat her (mmm mmm) like no other? (naw)
I don't know, I think I need to ask my brother Suga Free
(Chorus 3: Suga Free)
Ooh, do I love her, Do I need her? (DJ Quik: mmm hmm)
And when she tell me she love me I don't believe her (yeah, you do)
Now do I love her (mmm hmm) or care about her (you should)
You ne me nome, ne me nome, fore I lock you in that box again

(DJ Quik)
Do I love her do I need her? (Box again)
Do I take my money out and feed her? (ne me nome!)
And do I treat her a-like no other? (yaah!)
I don't know I think I need to ask my brother Suga Free

(Suga Free)
Ooh, do I love her, do I need her? (sure do)
And when she tell me she love me I don't believe her (she need you too)
And do I love her (mmm hmm) or care about her? (you outta)
You ne me nome, leave me alone, before I lock you in that box again

(DJ Quik)
Do I love her do I need her? (Box again)
Do I take my money out and feed her? (Box again!)
And do I treat her a-like no other?

(Suga Free)
Ne me nome[Verse 1]
Don't get mad when you see me with my prostitute

If it ain't the pimp music, it's the game I have
You know how stupid you look at me when you hatin, my friend
I'll prolly have to blast yo ass if I see you again
You on a bus stop pushin that bitch till it came
You say goodbye for 30 minutes cause you gots no game
Who you talkin to like that, don't question me ho
You the bitch in kindergarten
That got her mouth washed out with soap
Ho I'm a pimp I'm from Pomona I got game I got class
I got sucker-repellent on me homie I'll beat yo ass
I hear you pimpin now, huh? Well ain't that nice
Ain't never sent a prostitute nowhere a day in your life
And tell your homies I was at a music grindin
With my prostitutes standin right out front
Then tellin me you had two of them punk

[Hook]
Don't, fight the pimpin'
Don't, fight the pimpin'
Don't, fight the pimpin'
Nigga don't, fight the pimpin

[Verse 2]
Her name was bitch, cause she fucked for free
But now when Suga met her not after fuckin with me
Oh no, cause either you gon be a run-down-the-hill-and-get-some bitch
Or walk-down-the-hill-and-get-em-all hustler, so come on
With ya bad self in high heels on, come on
Lips, hips, fingertips on the stroll, come on
Respect the game bitch, do as you're told
Cause I been pimpin prostitutes since 17 years old
Done seen LB, ?????, Warren Y, AY, A-Cap, Norlean Clear
Patrick Camp, ?????????? graduated from state
And got my game from all the freaks gonna wreck my case
It's my prerogative, run my game bitch and it's gonna come back
Pimp pimp pimp pimp pimp pimp P-I-M-P positive
Look for the holder knock (knock)
Give her the sugar lock (lock)
Get at the ho, strip the ho
Now I got ho on the cock (cock)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now how fine do I gotta get?
To have a prostitute servin me the way she do
Now how fine do I gotta get?
If I wanna wait 5 years to give you the blues
Now how fine do I gotta get?
If I kick it with her would gettin bang nigga what's my name
Now how fine do I gotta get?
If I jack off with a sock in the sunshine homie
And you see that yellow spot
I'm a full-fledged pimp, I made two hoes faint
But I'mma listen to yo ass say what I can and I can't
Fuck that! Man this Laneway, straight from the dirt
And I'll beat a bitch ass till she respects my work
Old tired ass nigga don't see she wanna be snatched
And wonder why them bitches leavin with no dap and no snacks
And rather sit here with no cigarettes and no beer
Complainin about how you can't pay yo bills
And the bitch right here

[Hook]Quik:
My name is Quik & I be moving fast like a race car
But I'm top seed #1 like the pace car
Whether you up on me or you chillin' way far
You can tell almost immediately that I'm aced off
So listen muthafucka why you comin' off hard
My objective is to catch you off guard
Get covert & infiltrate yo' clique
Crack yo' shit & mack yo' bitch
Now tell me could you conceive a nigga all up in her beaver
Givin' her the love fever for hours at a time before I take a breather
And when she tell me she loves me I don't believe her
Cause I rock in stereo or mono hot like gonno-
Rhea burnin' everytime you take a pee uh
So when you see a nigga out with his girl
Then baby play like you don't know me & we'll keep in a twirl
Because baby I go deeper than the deep blue seas
Baby do you really wanna play the flute on me?
I'll give you a sack & take it back & you'll die to get it
Little punk cause I'm fly with it

Chorus

Smack the booty with no pimples
Caress ya back then rub ya nipples

But don't forget to fuck me
Cause you got more bounce than Roger Troutman

Soak me baby give me that good thang

Look into my eyes & tell me what do you see
Oh you jockin' my entourage DJ Quik & AMG
Well get yo' groove on cause I ain't hatin' on the homies

All I wanna do is slide up in & slide back out
Slap you in yo' face & stick it dead in yo' mouth

To put the proper hood on it
Peep how I struck up bitch jump in the air
Stay there until I tell you come down

She'll sell a nice dream but bitch you'll
Have better luck tryin' to find 2 Pac than
Me buying you somethin' off the ice cream truck
Oxygen you leave 'lone leave me 'lone
Before I lock you in that little bitty box again
Don't let up y'all just keep her soakin' wet up
Playa playa & tell her when she need to shut up
Don't lighten up naw nigga you better you better tighten up
Throw ya head back back back back
Lean it to the side hey playas (Yeah!)
Tell 'em that we fly (We fly!) Ooooh catastrophe!
Bitch rather slide down a slide of razor blades
Into a pool of pimp piss but this ho had the audacity
To ask me for a dollar even though that's all I had left
These greedy lying ass hoes'll fifty cents yo' ass to death!

Fly for life, this life is mine, willin to die..
Don't cost a dime to stay out of mine, not a dime..
Indica thai, makin me high, you wanna try?

Up up and away, sunshine, blue skies, fly
And I see orange stars, green clovers, and blue diamonds
Feelin nutritious!
Makin love to my, beotches, beat it
You ain't gonna make no puss I done sewed her up
Get my money type pimp player ?? ?? are we? (No) Cool
Now I reside in Pomona
I got some bitches on the corner
My baby momma with em too
Cause I'm a motherfuckin fool (Whassup Suga Free?)
The price of pussy baby
The price of pussy babyyyyyyyy!

[?? - not listed]
?? ?? buddies hangin with you while I'm shakin em
And everything they say has got to do with you not takin em
Just hear me when you work out are you ?? with your friends
Cause life is gettin short and see I'm all about my yen
The Westside of Pomona is the city where it's happenin
City of sin, and I miss them days back on Jacqueline
Still it was the state of mind don't think that we be playin
{?something in spanish?} no cuerte, you know what I'm sayin
The method of detectin niggas all up in yo' game
Can never be done, if you continue to remain
A victim in life, for the fact that love don't love nobody
I shoulda been this numb back in the days of O.G. Chotty(?)
Sayin..

[Unlisted singer]
Oooh, you can run away from a playa but you can't hide

[Suga Free]
No you can't hide from yo'self
Because everywhere you go, there you are

[Unlisted singer]
Oooh, you can run but there's no places left to hide

[Suga Free]
And kiss my pimpin ASS
Cause some of y'all niggas be KILLIN me!
Fly for life, this life is mine, willin to die.. (fly for life)
Don't cost a dime to stay out of mine, not a dime..
(not a got damn dime)
Indica thai, makin me high, you wanna try? (Yeah)

Strange weeds in the garden, bird pickin up seed killed game
Here come a passion mark, jealous playa hat'n lame
And he's slippin like a bad transmission too
Givin bitches his money, now do that sound like you?
They say money don't ?? and it's hard to make
I think about it everytime I bump a bitch to break
You couldn't pay me no money to respect a bitch
Fall in love, get married, and watch her take half my shit
But you a gangsta - yeah you hard as fuck!
A straight killa to your homies but that pussy got you stuck
I got game - somethin you stuck on
I want some money but you wanna get your fuck on, trick
Shoot a nigga cause he from the other side of the street
But scared to let yo' bitch go out, cause yo' game is weak
Now how your money want my honey?
So how your money want my ho?
Cause youse a gangsta, liquor, sucker, fucker
Teaser, pleaser, slap her, tap her
In the back of her, the bed, the flow that's yo' ho
On the couch, in her mouth, check it out, her gut
Her butt, so rough, so tough, mmmmm
Bust a nut get up and pimp or shut the fuck up
Now what you gon' be nigga
Part of the problem or part of the solution?
A paper institution, see the institution upon seducin
Y'all know that nigga that be turf talkin that old ying-yang
Killin me with that buh-bullshit, don't be wantin a damn thang
Now correct me if I'm wrong; I love my money
Myself my weed but anything else can get the fuck on!

Fly for life, this life is mine, willin to die.. (fly for life)
Don't cost a dime to stay out of mine, not a dime..
(not a got damn dime)
Indica thai, makin me high, you wanna try? (Yeah)

I heard a bitch say if you hit a bitch then youse a bitch yourself
I said
"Then call me Dwana bitch and I'll beat that bitch to death playa"
I see you got that nigga pussy-whipped, with that pussy grip
On that pussy trip, starin at your pussy lip
You say you got too much pride to ho
Bitch if push come to shove, you'd be ready to go
Uh-oh, here come push and now go shove in the front and back
Tre' can-dy paint great with goldies on brand new dubs
Ready to kidnap that brain with that game
That I got from Tony Lang(?), Ernest Lang(?) and Jermaine
Black tone's my backbone when ass gone my jawbone will be gone
My knee-bone will be to my ankle bone
Ay Tony Lang(?) you better tell em
Get ready to tell this nigga a joke or somethin
Man cause I'mma overwhelm him
Them jealous niggas don't believe us
So I'mma wreck the microphone and (?) between the Devil and Jesus
And I, tip-toe, to Top Hat Liquor sto'
To buy some drank and zig-zags for this dank - see
The very same winos, beggin for change
Gettin drunk, tellin lies, just the same ol' thang
Now I'm rollin down ?? in the lane, by the curb
Pushin Fosgate Alpine woofers with reverb
My homey Lil' Man, Loco Y, Crazy D
Lil' Shamu from Sin-town, Doo G Greg(?) and O.G. Down Down
As I take you face to face to a place
That takes the place of all place to place, I rest my case

Fly for life, this life is mine, willin to die.. (fly for life)
Don't cost a dime to stay out of mine, not a dime..
(not a got damn dime)
Indica thai, makin me high, you wanna try? (Yeah)
Fly for life, fly for life, fly for life! (Fly for life)
Ahhh..Ay check this out Quik
Ay man this shit tripped me out one day man
My Uncle told me man right, I asked him for a dollar right?
He said man - any of them lil' girls at yo' school?
Do they say they love you? Do they say they'll do anything for you?
I said yeah man, all the time - right?
He looked at me dog.. {*laughing*}
.. and he said, man some of 'em wasn't playing

[Suga Free]
Straight from my momma ho, she said boy you betta tell that bitch to kick
Forget about the dick, get, turn a trick, then yell GERONIMO!
Suga Free, I keep it P.I
If lovin the pimpin is wrong Pimpin, I don't wanna be right!
She said her childhood was bad - crying, tellin the pimpin
She got molested by her dad - all she want is attention
Now you want somethin else to feel though? Nigga you mean to tell me
You'd rather settle for apple instead of a peach?
Man a square bitch instead of a real ho? Huh? What, she cool?
Yeah trick as long as you pay for that cuchina you the motherfuckin fool
"Hey Suga Free man, you still the shit!" Ah yeah playa
That's cause I cracks my whip a lil' bit
And fuck 'em real hard without givin 'em no dick
What the hell fo'? Like you really give a fuck about this dick
And if you did get a lil' bit you'll get lazy and let the pussy sell slow
*tchk* Oh brother, now one wants more attention than the other
But fuck her, she came to pay not to stay so get another

"Oh my gosh!" "Lil' bitch." "Get the money ho!"
"On!" "Ugly-ass bitch!" "Yes honey
You sho' take me to work in style!"
"Oh my gosh!" "Lil' bitch." "Get the money ho!"
"On!" "Tell me some of that old lies of yours
And make me stop thinkin about the truth!"

[Suga Free]
Here I go! Yo!
Shit they finally let the pimpin out the pen, HERE I GO!
Bitch what you mean wait? Yo
Now didn't waitin make the motherfuckin bridge break?
And didn't fuckin that bitch make you predictable?
And when you woke up in the mornin, wasn't you still broke?
She loves her pimp, stays dapper for him
If she got any dreams, you want them too
Take her to the county, fill out that CH-7 form
Nigga I ain't the motherfuckin sucker
I pop my collar everytime I swallow, wholeness
Rippin the linin up out that motherfucker!
Bitch-ass niggas hatin sayin, "I don't see how he do it"
That's cause they scared of the rules
Lookin for naps and no backbone to put into it
If I hang around NINE BROKE MOTHERFUCKERS JUST LIKE YOU
I WOULD BE THE TENTH!
"Why don't you straighten up and get a job?"

"Oh my gosh!" "Lil' bitch." "Get the money ho!"
"On!" "Ugly-ass bitch!" "Yes honey
You sho' take me to work in style!"
"Oh my gosh!" "Lil' bitch." "Get the money ho!"
"On!" "Tell me some of that old lies of yours
And make me stop thinkin about the truth!"[Produced by Tae Beast of Digi+Phonics & Frank Dukes]

[Intro]
Got a sack of marijuana, think I'm 'bout to bend a corner
Ain't no telling who my money for
Got my dope from cross the border
Got my home on Figueroa, ain't no telling where that pussy go

[Hook]
Will you sell that pussy for me?
Will you sell that pussy for me? (Will you sell that pussy for me?)
Will you sell that pussy for me?
Will you sell that pussy for me? (Will you sell that pussy for me?)

[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
Check the forecast, it's Wavy Q, I should make the news
My fortune said that I'll be pimping you and your pussy juice
Super sweet, sell a trick a treat, hope your lips in shape
Cause you worked your feet as you stroll them streets, beeper checking
Hope no cops arresting, girl, I told you them narcs be pressing
Better act like you a pedestrian and don't mention my name
My pimping is game, cold limp with my cane, got gold on my chain
Come pinky my ring, it's so blickety bling
On 51st and Figg, grew up about ten minutes from the real Ricky
Where the shoelaces is orange with H hats like we from Houston
Condoms in hoes' purses with baby wipes for they coochie
You's a ho that's selling booty, no need to be acting bougie
Bitch, I give your ass a noogie and a chicken nugget
And make you watch me at the movies, I'm panoramic
My filming be rated pimping, my mink dragging
With two bitches that go and get it, my hoes get it

[Hook]

[Bridge 2x]
Hut one, hut two
Hut three, hut four (Sell that pussy for me)
Will you sell that pussy for me?
Will you sell that pussy for me? (Will you sell that pussy for me?)

[Interlude: Suga Free]
I ain't asking, I'm telling you, bitch

[Verse 2: Suga Free]
Uh-huh, yeah, watch me go Black Forest ham
A new school player laced with the old gift gab
And don't let your Shark Week mouth override your Green Goldfish ass
So for every ho you clown, I'mma crown two
And anything good hurts and I cried
Shit I just don't want to throw it up in my mothafuckin' face
Or I choose to not do this around you
See ho you like a brain aneurysm
Want two heads with the same dandruff in 'em
Only to scratch the itch with baby rattlesnake fangs
No Head and Shoulders or anti-venom
Yeah, P, this is gentlemanly leisure, the oldest game left to play
And the hard head that make a soft ass played out
Will forgive and forget yesterday
Now get 'em, Q, a pimp on foot, go to sleep carless, wake up to a Cadillac
Remember Forrest Gump walked and he was pretty stupid
So you know what? Accept the fact that the bitch belongs to the world
P, cause that ho only yours as long as she hoeing
But Happy Pimping and Merry Ho Ho
Keep an eye on bottom bitch too
Cause that bitch'll run a ho or two off, mane
Pimps only fuck with pimps, homie, that's why we so solid
Red to blue, to debt, to due, it's easier
To put a watermelon through the eye of a needle
This is done by choice, not by force
I ain't asking, I'm telling you

[Hook: SZA]

[Outro: Suga Free]
She gon' choose
Man that ho gon' work hard for you, jack
Suga... Q!
Peep the suspension that needs no stasis
Bitch if you ain't gon' do it for me then do it for yourself, ok!
Oh I'll pimp a BB out of a spray paint can![Verse One: Goldie Loc]
Look baby I know you done what you had to do
I was in the red neighborhood draped in all blue
I'm tryin to scoop them little checks up
But the minute that I'm in it then you talk about hold up
Somin change man the shit feels strange
I should of never sold your ass my sixty eight ways
Ever since I scooped you up in my big black truck
I been lookin for your ass cuz a nigga wanna fuck
You know what I'm doin ain't sippin
Cuz when you see me with my three hoes baby that's hip
Is this the reason why your ass actin funny
You only bring your ass around when I'm spending my money
I was breaking my probation taking your ass places
Cuz that's a violation. me and you conversation
Don't have nuttin we face it
I gotta lot hoes that I can run around chasin biatch

Hook: [Soopafly] & {Latoiya Williams}
Girl I don't know what you done done
But it's not feeling good to me {not feeling good to me}
I wouldn't of done what you let me do
You brought out the freak in me {brought out the freak in me}

Boy I don't think that you really know how much you mean to me
[How much you mean to me]
Had to walk away and let you go
Cuz you brought out the freak in me [you brought out the freak in me]

[Verse Two: Tray Deee]
I use the move with the nest spittin jewls at the best
She a thug but don't come with that rude disrespect
I got game but not playin sportsment like
You only did against me if mama tought you right ooh
So what cah hair wet nails dipped in all
You gone say Tray Deee Tray Deee take the penitentry fall
No don't ask me yet i rather let the time reveal
If you object just a sex being mind fo real
Can you relate give me space until its time to chill
You know I put it down and make it how you like to feel
You be another sucka you could floss and toss
It ain't the cost just the fact that I'm a mackin boss
I like to dig you out but I don't dig you mouth
So usually ??? hit the ribs and back
Don't hate the gangsta baby cuz I'll call you soon
Don't sleep too late check out ime is noon

Hook: Soopafly & Latoiya Williams

[Verse Three: Suga Free]
Naw uh-uh wait, see Snoop what home girl on the chorus say?
Got turned out and wanna walk away pshh
I’ll let that happen when you stop rapping and Richard Pryor starts talking today
See life is like a piñata, baby go hit it
But don’t be suprised if it jumped out took the stick from yo ass and starting whoopin' yo ass with it
And how much I mean to you? I don’t care
Trick especially if you lacking la-da-da-da I don’t care
And your where-abouts, sucks teeth
Please! Ain’t a bone in my body that’ll prolly allow me to attempt to pretend that you something that I care about
And if it was left up to me you would be walking away getting me some money, Not walking without no guidance doing it free
Like Constance’s friend Who dat?
Oh, you know baby grandma stay right across the street from the church around the corner from Ms. Johnson and them
(Oh you mean glee ba-da-da shabba da ho)
Nice and easy, and if there’s a cure for this I don’t want itWhatcha gonna do?

Then hittin divorce court to pay child support to your baby's mother
Here comes the sheriff knockin at my front door

Gimme this, gimme that, do you got, can I have

If I could get a dollar, for everytime you look at me sideways
I'll pay the Westside on Friday's to build y'all playa haters y'all own highways
Don't trip on me partner, no uh-uh
I'm havin' visions of Bloody Mary with AIDS tryin' to give me some nana
You can't dictate mines, what I look like to you baby?
Besides the feelin' is fine
All natural like oat bran, engineered like no other
Fly for life, still as a mannequin when it comes to my mother
Capricorn baby and I'm stubborn just like you
So why don't you do me a favor and tell that lie to that fool
Don't get me twisted baby, I love you too
But when that rent and that car note come what love gon' do?
Baby, my money's on the clock, right around the block
You see me stack big knot, my music's all I got
So I'mma stay ready so I don't gotta get ready
Cause I rose like King Tut and resurrect it like Amadeus

[Hook]
If you stay ready
(Don't ask nobody, ask me baby)
You ain't got to get ready
(Same thing go around gon' come right back around)
If you stay ready
(Fa sho, can ya feel me?)
You ain't got to get ready
(Cause I can feel you)

[Playa Hamm]
Now, orange juice and Austy got me feelin' lodi dodi
Flippin' through my phone book tryin' to find me a hottie
I can't wait to let ya lies and just relax with
That ain't jockin' me cause of who I stacks with
Ain't too many I'm comin' across qualifyin'
But I be that player from the P that's just gon' keep on tryin'
I go from A to Y, cause I don't know no Z's
To the Brougham, blow the brains and enjoy the breeze
These hunnies got me wonderin' if I'll ever find one
That'll get me to that place where I wouldn't mind one
Out in traffic I see many lookin' choosable
It never fails though, I always end up usin' those
For whatever I'm needin' at that point in time
A get-away, a good one or another rhyme
I'm tired of the S.O.S. but it's real
Long as I feel 'em like I do I guess I'm just gon' deal

[Hook]
If you stay ready
(Same thing make you laugh will make you cry)
You ain't got to get ready
(We ain't worried about nothin', we fly for life)
If you stay ready... (What?)
You ain't got to get ready

[Suga Free]
Hey Playa Hamm, I know they sayin' oh boy that's come classic connection
Playa for real, ya - ya feel me? (Oh yeah-yeah)
Now this the - kingpin, Westside, best side, let's ride
And God bless my backbones, my homeboys like Black Tone

[Playa Hamm]
Bringin' it through for the true everytime I speak
Sprinkles the rest like '40, but they still comin' weaker
I'mma keep it simple so the tricks can comprehend
You can never be me, only see me with a end

[Suga Free]
Well if they ain't ripe yet, they can stay on the tree
Cause I'm your friendly neighborhood playa partner Suga Free
Liable to haul off and spit these P's that'll break you to your knees
She'll lie, steal and kill for real for me, Hamm please

[Playa Hamm]
Now what they thought baby? We ain't comin' to raw
If she broke she gon' get a job, or break the law
They say God blessed the child, God is on it so true
We ain't get it like we got it dependin' on you

[Suga Free]
Now I can show ya better than I can tell ya, so swell
No, put your clothes back on baby
I'm into breakin' hearts, promises and fingernails
There was no I's... And I put that on the Holy Ghost and four more God's
You broke my heart and I let you succeed
Cause to a playa that's a organ that you really don't need
Low and behold, what good is havin' a heart if it can break and be re-broke?
So if you stay ready what you gon' have to get ready for?

[Hook]
If you stay ready
(Kingpin for life y'all)
You ain't got to get ready
(Kingpin... ah ah)
If you stay ready
(I pin the tail on the funky enough)
You ain't got to get ready
(And shocks her with this funky stuff)
If you stay ready
(Why you bullshittin'?)
You ain't got to get ready
(What's happenin'?)
If you stay ready
(Kingpin for life)
You ain't got to get ready
(Kingpin for life, y'all)

You know... straight game...
Never... game... DJ Quik... what's up baby?
Playa Hamm... G-One... Robert Bacon... yeah[Intro] [MURS talking]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah YEAH!
Aaaah. Shhh shhh shhh shhh shhh
Whoa, calm down, calm down, wh-whoa
Whoa, wha-whoa wha-whoa whoa whoa. Shhhh
Let me talk Let me talk. Shhhh. Look. Whoa whoa

[Verse One] [MURS]
Calm down
What's this all about?
How you raise your voice and yellin' at me in my house?
Look I should kick you out if you want to scream and shout
Cause I'm just not in the mood for a heavy weight bout
Oh, that's what's up then
You keep on interruptin'
Like you runnin' thangs, hold up let me tell you somethin'
You can roll your eyes and stomp your feet
But your mouth might put your ass out in the street
Open your mouth again, the story never ends
Talkin' to me crazy like I'm one of your friends
I can't get a word in
You should try listenin'
I should call you Tyler Perry since you always dissin' men
If you keep on raisin' hell I'm gonna get up on my cell
So when the Police come, Miss Madea Goes To Jail
Well, well, well
Look who changed they tune
I think these fights go with the cycle of the moon
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm talkin' about PMS
And if we had more sex you wouldn't be so stressed
But you like to front like that time of the month
Ain't the reason why you got your panties all in a bunch
And that's figurative and literal
The shit you pull is pitiful
For one week a month you always make my life so miserable
So, here we go gettin' loud and obnoxious
When really what you need is some Motrin and chocolate
I'm only jokin'
On the low, kinda hopin'
That comedy will calm your ass down for the moment
I wanna turn the game on
You busy with the same song
Okay, I'm not right but look, I know I ain't wrong
You ain't goin' nowhere
Put them bags down
Got your hands in my face
Oh you think you bad now?
Okay
Let's just see where that gets you
Knock yourself out cause I'm not the one to hit you
And I ain't sleepin' on the couch
My neck's still hurtin' from the last time
We gotta talk now?
C'mon, can't it wait till halftime?
It's like your favorite past time
You yell and you scream
But nothing comes between a man and his favorite team
And look
Don't make me choose cause you just might lose
Now, take your ass to the other room, turn on the news
Wait, wait wait wait wait wait
I didn't mean it like that
I'm just excited from the game
C'mon baby come back
Look I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I got a little silly
But c'mon what really arguin' about now really?
You know I love you
You know you love me
But why does it always have to get so ugly?
Don't even want to hug me because you wanna stay mad
It's the crazy game that men and women play since way back
But men never win, so forget it man I'm out
Cause I already planned on sleepin' on the couch

[MURS talking]
You know what? Know what? Forget it, forget it. I'm finished. La la la la
Where's the remote? I'm takin' the good covers too
You can't take the good-you sleepin' on the sheets
And when you get cold don't try to snug up on me on the couch
Don't try to call me back in there later either. I'm out this mother!

[Verse Two] [Suga Free]
Wait a minute what? What did you say you gonna do to my Impala?
I'll jump out this car so fast and drop kick you in the medulla oblongata
Okay I see you stupid just like your momma and them
Yeah I said it
And I was just as stupid as you for stayin' with you
Cause I regret it
So let me get in clean
Cause the game don't change, people do
These little niggas jumpin' out blastin' in them skinny jean
And the last thing I need is your ass to hassle
Yeah man she told the judge I hit her
She hit herself in the head with a bag of apple
And I told her, "I hate goin' to your spot"
Cause her daddy can't say nothin'
Unless he put that thing on his neck that make him sound like a robot
And I sound retarded right?
I can't lie
One day a butterfly landed on a skull and brought tears to my eye
Think I'm ungrateful and she would never satisfy
Keep showin', they laugh at her cause her daddy got killed
Going to the hood tryin' to pay a nigga to pee on me
And you ever been with one or two bitches
Just you and her in the car
You know she farted but she lookin' at you like you did it
She kinda dirty to us
Man, I can't stand a woman, act polite, take a shit and never give a courtesy flush
One day we went to apply to a phat loan
She said, "Ah yes." Changed her voice up and said
"Bitch you don't ever talk like that at home"
But that's what woman do
Just like that, "This is my husband." Lie
I keep tellin' you, "Quit tellin' people that cause I ain't nothin' to you."Chorus:
Woe is me/ I can't get my bread up when it's so easy/
I can't keep my head above the stormy seas/
All I need/ Someone to look out for me
Toss me. (A life jacket) 4X

[Verse 1: Suga Free]

Ain't it so sweet, how I emerge
Making richy glitzy bourgeois people
Come party with us, kick it  and splurge
So I'ma [Suga Free] and keep me a life jacket on
Take the bitter with the sweet
And keep my hookers in the street
And keep [Suga Free] oh yeah
I'm on my way up to glory with this one this time dammit
Because I heard there's more there [Suga Free]
This can only be done by us
Now beg this pardon for me
Turn it up one good time and get the money [Suga Free]
Oh my God, I'm Quik like
[Quik: 'You love California for the gold, right?']
Nah, the broads [Suga Free]
Bitch, the shit I told you not to do today applies for every day, ho
Get it straight [Suga Free]
Shit, did you fuck me?
[Quik: What?]
You mean, you stayed home, bitch
Because your dog had puppies? [Suga Free]
Yeah, after I get off ho, take that Long Beach out, then sunset
Come back home and get my neck wet

Chorus:
Woe is me/ I can't get my bread up when it's so easy/
I can't keep my head above the stormy seas/
All I need/ Someone to look out for me
Toss me. (A life jacket) 4X

[Verse 2: Dj Quik]
I'm in a Chevy, with the top dropped
I parked both Benzes, but neither's in the shop
I'm on my third Rolex, but show me what's next
And I bet I'll do get it, do it, done it
Dag gone it, I'm a mess
And when I play this guitar
It's goin' make my dick hard
Something like the Scarecrow
Michael Jackson
Fuck the Wizard
I should have gone ?
Bipolar is Julliard
Either extreme, I'll kill you motherf**ckers, on the schoolyard
Checks off, in bound
Watch the Quiksta get down
I hate a hacker, Hacker players need to go back
Sit down
Cuz if you ain't with the now
That makes you way back when
And you can keep all of that retro-dated action
Now get up on my time zone
Quit workin' with limestones
Switch that shit for marble and granite
Produced Whitney and Janet
Oh you can't
Nobody else on this planet
It's just me, I'm a plant
And I'm so dope, you can't handle it
I rhyme, and you ramblin'

I rhyme and you ramblin'

Chorus:
Woe is me/ I can't get my bread up when it's so easy/
I can't keep my head above the stormy seas/
All I need/ Someone to look out for me
Toss me. (A life jacket) 4X


[Verse 3: Dom Kennedy]

Yeah, tryna burn somethin'
Buy a lot of books these days
Tryna learn somethin'
Cars that ain't got no miles
You know my style
See me and be like 'wow'
She so aroused
Had to let the windows down
You know the crown
The all black White Sox hat
It's goin' down
Take a ni**a shoppin' or somethin'
Don't be frontin'
Told everybody we datin', no we wasn't
We was just havin' some fun, then you tripped
Talkin' that relationship shit
Then I dipped
Went to the studio, quick, Got with Quik
Told him 'let me get a 16', made a hit
The O.P.M. money, legit, keep countin'
Last time I made ten records off three ounces
I'ma need a house with a view and three fountains
Just a little something for my niggas to keep bouncin'
Uh, cuz we don't dance much
I still sag and pull my pants up
Aye, ya'll should start doin' stand up
You sold records, pull them scans up
Aye, said my niggas pull them vans up
Aye, now you niggas understand us
Yeah, Dj Quik hooked the jam up
Sound like he hooked the band up
Suga Free I'm a fan bruh
Aye, this finna fuck the land up
Uh
Cuz it'll neva stop
Your style is like lemonade, it'll neva pop
Everytime you on TV, I don't neva watch
I'm the one who created the game, I can neva flop
Rest in Peace to Etta James, she's in a better spot
This summer I'm making fur and wearing leather hot

Dj Quik, you're the greatest[Hook: DJ Quik impersonating Suga Free]
I don't need nobody, I don't want nobody
I don't care about nobody, they don't care about me
I don't need nobody, I don't want nobody
I don't care about nobody, I just care about me

[Suga Free]
Ay pimpin, this for that trick mayne
Yeah, the one that laughed at me when I told 'em God was sendin' me a boat, but then he cried when DJ Quik came
A day in the life of a playa name Free
When John Mayer told the world he didn't CARE for me
But look at Obama in the office for the get back, mayne
I believe in takin', go to school and GET that game
Dark brown Cognac to the head
You can't tell me shit, nigga Michael Jackson dead
I'm holding back my tears when I'm listenin' to "Off the Wall"
That medicine didn't kill 'em -- y'all did cause y'all talked about him like a dog
No, I ain't pickin' up no girl for no security, Jack
Didn't Paris Hilton finally get her jewelry back?
And Tiger Woods needs some back-up
Boy, don't you ever apologize to no prostitute, now hit the green and tee THAT up
But let a mack get 'er;
'member that sex scene on "Baby Boy"? I woulda fucked them hoes just like Jack
Now I'mma kiss the ground like a 747 stack
Cause success is the greatest revenge, but it's gon' back
(It's gon' handle what's right, it's so certificate
Then you better believe in me)
Yeah, so rack 'em up
Yeah, Suga Free the P, man
Pomona style, man have them niggas crackin' up
So don't rush me
I don't drink alcohol, but when I do drink I prefer Dos Equis

[Hook: DJ Quik impersonating Suga Free]×2
I don't need nobody, I don't want nobody
I don't care about nobody, I just care about me

[DJ Quik]
Now my life, is backstage, wristbands, flashlights
Then, do the same thing we did last night - Jam
I'm retro Nickelodeon, I'm still All That
I even rock the mane just like Mike Jack
Addicted to the night life just like crack
But in the black Mercedes with the ladies in the back
I like to make you brick, it's what makes me tick
The way the team decided by just one kick
Now do the grand slam, damn
Take you back so far, I got you flyin' Pan Am
I get the club packed tight like canned ham
Sealin' all your artists, now pass your exam
Or get down or gon' get it knit up
I got a Quincy Jones in my bones, genes split-up
DJ Quiksta in the center like a pent-up
And I don't break down - I been up

[Hook: DJ Quik impersonating Suga Free]×4
I don't need nobody
I don't want nobody
I don't care about nobody, that don't care about me[Verse 1: Butch Cassidy]
We like to spend our time making music day and night
Bang all the few new girls who keep it nice and tight
Then, we may blow some trees and get to drinkin on the creek?
This is our way of life and everyone's a G
I'm usually short on time before i've got the game on life ? (time)
Yes, y'all, this is our dream, makin' money and diggin out (dimes)
What cha know in cali, we really throw a party
And if you didn't know, you really should ask somebody

[Hook: Chevy Jones]
Nothing could be better, than you and me together
(ooh, ohh, you, ooh, ooh you, just ?? on it)
Nothing could be better, than you and me together
(ooh, ooh, you, ooh ooh you, just ?? on you)

[Verse 2: Bishop Lamont]
Bump this at your family reunion
Bust a soul train line, summertime
Even granny out there groovin'
Have a good time, whatever y'all doin
Right now, somewhere black folks barbecuin'
World on wheels do it big get to movin'
Fresh out the car wash, floss low-cruisin
Up and down the 'shaw, watch out for the law
?? some new kicks from the fox hills mall
Girls all around, knock 'em all down
Keep your pimp hand strong, if a hooker tryna clown
Hit the beach for a spill, big females
Lips right, hips right, tits right, all the details
Spill drink on your apparel because of clumsy ass hoes
Hit brother daryl's for a white t, watch before he closes
Pro 5's 3x tall, this the way the west ball
Heard about a crackin pool party, homie just called
Full of fine freaks, woman in nothin but they drawers
And they can make it slap, clap like an audience applause
Plus nobody i know got killed in south central l.a
Today was a good day

[Hook: Chevy Jones]
Nothing could be better, than you and me together
(ooh, ohh, you, ooh, ooh you, just ?? on it)
Nothing could be better, than you and me together
(ooh, ooh, you, ooh ooh you, just ?? on you)

[Verse 3: Bo-Key Loc & Chevy Jones]
Oh, i need some 13 skates (cause we bout to go groovin')
Boogie circle, high off the purple
Me and my babies (let the ?? on ya)
We don't hear nothin' but the music
So relax and enjoy the ride
Let the top down tonight
That's all i wanna do
Let the wind caress your skin I'm feelin it
Hey, what a lovely day with my baby boy
And i sure don't want for the fun to end now

[Hook: Chevy Jones]
Nothing could be better, than you and me together
(ooh, ohh, you, ooh, ooh you, just ?? on it)
Nothing could be better, than you and me together
(ooh, ooh, you, ooh ooh you, just ?? on you)

[Verse 4: Suga Free]
You know we keep the party crackin like it's mandatory out here
My momma even said baby, come dance with me out here
Ain't nobody shootin, ain't nobody scrappin
Barefootin' on the beach with family, that's what's happenin'
Somebody gotta show these kids that there's more to love
And there's more to life than gangbangin and dealin with drugs
Then hit the club with some independent sexy california ladies
Shorty tryin' to party tonight in here baby
After this, we hit the after hours (it don't stop)
Now I'm all up in her head, so i could check me a night
"ooh girl, how you doin'? where you came?"
Give me that bubblegum tongue with that pretty scream and rant
What could be better than that?
She catchin' her flight back to sac and took the rent a car back
Oh? a pool party now plus a pool party and a suga free show?
You ain't said nothin, pimpin, you already know
Look at uncle larry with his lyin ass, probably lyin now
My cousin becky fired up, now she quiet down
B-boy she with my cousin 'aight
You know what I'm talkin about, you got one too
And you wonder why

[Hook: Chevy Jones]
Nothing could be better, than you and me together
(ooh, ohh, you, ooh, ooh you, just ?? on it)
Nothing could be better, than you and me together
(ooh, ooh, you, ooh ooh you, just ?? on you)[Snoop Dogg]

Pimp on, In a real way[Verse 1: Rittz]
The city is glamming
In the spot coming from my gucci lenses
Plus tour busses scoops and benzes
I ain't used to this I came through the trenches
Now my cousin fill up on boots and end em
Said I can't pronounce multiple bank accounts
Now I give all my hommies all my hand me downs
Shit I used to get a hundred bucks a show
Now I get a couple grand to come and stand around
And drink shots of crown but never snitched to real
One too many gotta catch some air
Rooftop parties bars everywhere
But success don't rest out of hair corvair
Big rozay ho's day when I come and show them
This the me I get 'em tipsy freeze
Be going both ways pussy lickers skills that go showcase
Late night bunch of hoes at my doorway

[Hook:]
It's 4 in the morning and the party don't end
Baby come over, baby come over
Our clothes on the ground drinking Crown till we spin
Fuck till we're sober

[Verse 2: Rittz]
Two fucker take a break to take a shot
Restaurant closed so we go in
Have my iphone out making homemade porn
And she screaming oh Lord, like she born again
One of us going down on snorkeling
Walk by my hotel room door and
I'm sure you heard us bone and probably came the moment
And fuck a maid keeping knocking reorienting
She give me oral then I told her you're a 10
Lying cause your really bout an eight and a half
But a head game is the greatest I had
It's a damn shame that I'm singing the last
Bet it was a blast she was making the splash
And I got one more favor to ask
Can I put a little bit cocaine on your ass
I took a sniff and I told the bitch slider this mess

[Hook:]
It's 4 in the morning and the party don't end
Baby come over, baby come over
Our clothes on the ground drinking crown till we spin
Fuck till we're sober

[Verse 3: Suga Free]
I'm feeling like a rabbit coming out of the egg
Feeling like a motherfucker breaking down record my tool
The nerve of this nigga with a flat on glove
Hella body with a bounce this is pimpin ho
Polished, Groomed! shake with a fine grim
And buffed out to a shine that’ll blind a bitch, don’t I walk like I Got I all down to a science bitch
Kinda like domino's pizza
And don't get too comfortable in the morning
Money always feel better than sex to me
The trick if I pick it up and ask for free
Motherfucker flamboyant
When I walked on the snow baby
And the sound of Sade fills the room with jamma bitch which fills my pocket
I like to wiggle wiggle it more I'm a hustler
Walk around pimpin' I don't touch 'em
I thought you knew that pimps don't go to jail
For pimpin', they go for mispimpin'
So don't do that...
And understand God made pimps so a ho can have a man
And a trick won't understand
Suga Free... my man!

[Hook:]
It's 4 in the morning and the party don't end
Baby come over, baby come over
Our clothes on the ground drinking crown till we spin
Fuck till we're sober[Suga Free]
One day I heard somebody say if it's good to ya
Then it must be good for ya, but bullshit
Cause niggas shrinkin', gettin' skinny than a motherfucker
I bumped my head, when I shoulda been dead
When I was mislead, and I like it...
Okay! Man y'all better quit lyin' to y'all girl
You'll be surprised what she'll do for you man cause that's y'all world
And she can help you do it better if you sit down and talk
And we all know that shit be soundin' like walk-walk-walk-walk
But if you sincere about what's comin' out your mouth
And you tellin' her ass what this game is about
Man she'll work you, and everytime you wake up
And get G'd up and brushed up, this bitch wanna jump for you
But you know what's so sad?
Way over half of y'all niggas will never get a chance to experience that
You think she chillin' with her friend again?
Man she walkin' down the street so she can make me some ends
I keep my nails done, I speak well, I'm watchin' my cholesterol
I live on a body of water, enjoy drinkin' alcohol

[Hook]
So fly, and I like it
Badda ba ba ba, badda ba ba ba
So fly, and I like it
Badda ba ba ba, badda ba ba ba

[Snoop Dogg]
Bo$$ Dogg got mass appeal, sellin' everything
From pussy to George Foreman barbeque grills (Yes you do!)
Hey Suga Free can I light that? (Go on Dogg)
Hold on cuz, I'll C right back
I take a trip to the flip Rip side where the sun shine
Catch a plane to Spain, it's all for a boat ride
Of course I'm so fly, know why
In a suit and bowtie, bitch I'm Blowfly
(Rap dirty) I got 'em lined up to get on my team
They tryin' to figure out where they get signed up
Yeah my game is top-notch
They've been buyin' this shit, since the days of hop scotch
It's like I'm reachin' through the wire
Nowadays I feel I'm preachin' to the choir (chuuch)
Y'all think that money grow on trees?
Pullin' on my branches, rollin' up my leaves?

[Hook]
So fly, and I like it
Badda ba ba ba, badda ba ba ba
So fly, and I like it
Badda ba ba ba, badda ba ba ba

[Suga Free]
And yeah we know a lot of y'all be thinkin' pimps be soft
But for us she payin', and for y'all she cost
So if you on my Cadillac and see some polish remover
It ain't my mama's partna it's mine, now get outta line
You see this hanger boy? I can untie this little piece of metal so fast
It'll make her lower her motherfuckin' voice
Cause you ain't payin' nobody bitch, you ain't nobody bitch
And you don't know nobody bitch, you don't make nobody rich
But you hatin' on me, hopin' Suga Free gon' crash
When I got pimpin' written all up and down my ass
I can dance a dance, step until I'm ready to go
Just like my mama or G-Wayne or George Jefferson ho
You see this nail file, nigga don't laugh at that
The letter P's the only letter in the alphabet
I'm kinky like my fro that's why she scratches my back
I cut my nails everytime I pull her hair like that

[Hook] - 2X
So fly, and I like it
Badda ba ba ba, badda ba ba ba
So fly, and I like it
Badda ba ba ba, badda ba ba ba(Xzibit talking)
Come here Tre, what's up son, come on
To whom it may concern, yeah, listen
Sorry I'm away so much, yeah, yeah
All the sons, daughters, penitentiary niggas, yeah feel me
Uh, sorry I'm away so much, yeah

(Xzibit)
My son was born about four and a half years ago
Loved and protected him, amazin how fast they grow
I came to know about his likes and his dislikes (yeah)
Video games, taught him how to ride his first bike (that's it)
This is the life my little nigga, I see you gettin all upset
When I leave the house, poutin, let me tell you about
Tryna make it in this world and provide for you
Cause on them overseat plane rides I miss you too
Never knew that I would have to be away so much
Five thousand dollar phone bills keepin in touch
We Starskey and Hutch, yeah, we partners for life, yeah
I rock mics, so I'm sorry when I hug you if I squeeze too tight
Long nights in the studio take me away
Gettin mad cause I'm tired and you want me to play
Money can't replace time, I'm just tryna get you outta the fine relyin
And expand your mind my lil' ni', yeah
Yeah, c'mon

(Chorus-X)
Look, sorry I'm away so much
Understand me, yeah
It's for you, hah, yeah (you, and you, and you)
C'mon, look, sorry I'm away so much
Huh, we keep it gangsta
Look

(Xzibit)
I got a brother locked down, he be out in a couple
Knuckle for knuckle, a veteran and nothin but muscle
Now broadcastin live from behind the wall
Stayin tight through long kites and telephone calls
Gettin hype when you see your brother on T.V
Can't wait for your release so you can roll with me
Arrange everything exactly how it's supposed to be
For right now here's a thousand, J, stay lo-key
You say damn Xzibit, whyn't you pay a nigga a visit
Time limits got me movin a million miles a minute
Knee deep, gotta strike while the iron is hot
Still gotta eat and keep the lights on when it's not
Sleepin on cots, bullet wounds got you in knots
I wish I was there to snatch you up instead of the cops
Muthafuck it, do the time and get it out of the way
You goin from convict to corporate nigga in one day (in one day)

(Chorus)

(Quik)
Now I ain't never been this hot before
So in essence it's obvious, I ain't never been this out before
I'm spending 25-8 days, 366 times a year
Up in the studio freakin and mixin rhymes in here
Nothin but beer, bud smoke, Hen and Coke, women and sheer
Callin playa niggas there
Not the kinda place I really wanna bring my son
Get on lil' Dane, gon' in there and have you some fun
Used to be that ??? be up there sewin ya clothes
While I'm with you on the Playstation showin you codes
Hit the X button stupid, forward, left, right, X
Now I'm tryna get your college fund, bustin with X

(Suga Free)
Come here, give that here dada
No no don't do that mama cause dada be back
Here go your ba-ba, Pampers, flashy ???, you can see that
You tryna figure out
Why dada talkin to you through this glass on the phone
Ooh, I socked a bitch and then she snitched, but I'll be home
Can't keep me away, just can't stay away

(Chorus-Suga Free)
(Suga Free talkin to fade)
