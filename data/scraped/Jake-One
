[Skit: Seinfeld & Wale]

[Intro: Usher]
Couldn't make you wait forever, for forever
This is forever
I gotchu

[Hook: Usher]
If there's a question of my heart, you've got it
It don't belong to anyone but you
If there's a question of my love, you've got it
Baby, don't worry, I've got plans for you
Baby, I've been making plans, oh love
Baby, I've been making plans for you
Baby, I've been making plans
Baby, I've been making plans for you

[Verse 1: Wale]
(My sincerest apologies, I mean it)
Look, I'll admit it, albeit pathetic
That I'm in my late 20s, still never been to a wedding
Guess the idea of that lobby empty do not sit with me well
It’s not your fault they try get me cause I'mma need the sales
Cause I'm selfish, and I need you to myself
Tryna see you afloat, but don't wanna see you excel
Cause I failed and see you 'bout to cry
Cause when I enter they city they leave without they pride
I'm sorry, and you starin' at my comments
Fearin' it's gone always be you sharin' me with all them
Wrong, how dare I say ignore them?
Preparing for that day I leave you here and switch you for them
It's hard, you know temptation and all
Bitches out here tryna see if my relationship's strong
Get a place in the charts or runaway from your heart
Gave this music my all, nothing is sacred no more - I'm wrong

[Pre-Hook 1: Wale]
But I'm promisin' you better though
And your friends sayin', "let him go"
And we ain't gettin' any younger
I can give up now, but I can promise you forever though

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wale]
(Realest shit I ever wrote, realest shit I ever wrote
Realest shit I ever wrote, if you ever knew love)
I’ll admit it, let me be hypothetic
The day I find a woman I prolly be scared to share it
The idea of me finding love, would run somebody off
And true my wall could use some plaques, but still I gotta floss
Brush you off, see I'm kinda lost
Now I'm up in the club with a couple of Move Ons
And dark, good nigga, troubled heart
Went from fallin' in love to drunk and fallin' apart
This is hard, tryna find some time to move on
Cause when we lost our baby, I got shady, shit got too dark
Soft, and I thank you baby, you strong
My ex before you married too, you solo, I say so long
Nah, good terms how that ended
But it surely put a dent on how I worry about this business
Off white picket fences, on flights with the children
On site stealin' kisses on off nights my intentions but

[Pre-Hook 2: Wale]
But I plan to do it better though
But you still sayin' let it go
We ain't gettin' any younger
Women love me now but in your eyes we forever though

[Hook]

[Outro: Wale]
We ain't nothin' but some planets

(Outro Skit)[Produced by  Noah "40" Shebib and Hagler/Co-Produced by Jake One]

[Verse 1]
Somewhere between psychotic and iconic
Somewhere between I want it and I got it
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment
But I stay down, girl I always stay down, get down, never lay down
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now, so much on my plate now
People I believed in they don't even show they face now
What they got to say now? Nothin' they can say now
Nothin' really changed but still they look at me a way now
What more can I say now? What more can I say now?
You might feel like nothin' was the same

[Hook 2x]
I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know

[Verse 2]
And I hate that you don't think I belong to ya
Just too busy runnin' shit to run home to ya
You know that paper my passion
Bittersweet celebrations, I know I can't change what happened
I can't help it, I can't help it, I was young and I was selfish
I made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's
And now you hate me, stop pretendin', stop that frontin', I can't take it
Girl don't treat me like a stranger, girl you know I seen you naked
Girl you know that I remember, don't be a pretender
Gettin' high at the condo, that's when it all comes together
You know I stay reminiscing and make-up sex is tradition
But you been missin' girl and you might feel like nothin' was the same

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Drinkin', smokin', fuckin', plottin'
Schemin', plottin', schemin', gettin' money
Drinkin', fuckin', smokin', plottin'
Schemin', plottin', schemin', gettin' money

[Verse 3]
This the life for me
My momma told me this was right for me
I got 'em worried, like make sure you save a slice for me
I should have Spoons serve you up with a fork and knife for me
Your actions make us doubt you
Your lack of effort got me rappin' different
This the shit I wanna go out to
Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin'
Naked women swimmin', that's just how I'm livin'
Donate a million to some children, that's just how I'm feelin'
A nigga fillin' up arenas, who the fuck could see us?
I had to Derrick Rose the knee up before I got the re-up
Yours truly, the boy
I just build and build more, y'all niggas build to destroy
Y'all niggas party too much, man, I just chill and record
No filler, you feel it now if you ain't feel it before

[Outro]
Yes, Lord, this the shit I wanna go out to
Yeah, this the shit I wanna go out to[Produced by Jake One]

[Intro]
Chance's "NaNa" ad-lib

[Verse 1]
Kicked off my shoes, tripped acid in the rain
Wore my jacket as a cape, and my umbrella as a cane
The richest man rocks the snatch-less necklace
Spineless bitches in backless dresses
Wore my feelings on my sleeveless
My weed seedless, my trees leafless
I miss my diagonal grilled cheeses
And back when Mike Jackson was still Jesus
Before I believed in not believing in
Yeah, I inhaled, who believed in me not breathing in
Cigarette stained smile all covered in sin
My big homie died young; just turned older than him
I seen it happen, I seen it happen, I see it always
He still be screaming, I see his demons in empty hallways
I trip to make the fall shorter
Fall quarter was just a tall order
And I'm hungry, I'm just not that thirsty
As of late, all my verses seem not so verse-y
And all my words just mean controversy
Took the team up off my back, like "That's not your jersey?"
Stressin', pullin' my hair out, hoping I don't get picked
All this medicine in me hoping I don't get sick
Making all of this money hoping I don't get rich
Cause niggas still getting bodied for foams

[Verse 2]
Sometimes the truth don't rhyme
Sometime the lies get millions of views
Funerals for little girls, is that appealing to you?
From your cubicle desktop, what a beautiful view
I think love is beautiful, too
Building forts from broken dams, what a hoover could do
For future hoopers dead from Rugers shooting through the empty alley
Could've threw him an alley-oop, helping him do good in school
Damn that acid burn when it clean ya
I still miss being a senior
And performing at all those open mic events
Eyes closed, eyes closed seeing arenas
And I still get jealous of Vic
And Vic's still jealous of me
But if you touch my brother
All that anti-violence shit goes out the window along with you
And the rest of your team
Smoking cigarettes to look cooler
I only stop by to look through ya
And I'm only getting greedier
And I'm still Mr. Youmedia
And I still can't find Talent
And I'm still choosing classmates that wouldn't fuck
Mom still thinks I should go back to school
And Justin still thinks I'm good enough
And Mama Jan still don't take her meds
And I still be asking God to show his face
And I still be asking God to show his face

[Outro]
I am a new man, I am sanctified
Oh I am holy, I have been baptized
I have been born again, I am the White Light
Rain...rain don't go away[Produced by 6ix]

[Verse 1]
Living life like this is so crazy
This world is amazing
One day you're on top and the next she having your baby
Living life like this I get down, uh
When they come around, uh
I do my best to fall back and not, not make a sound
Feel like my mind gone but I'm still here
Don't fuck around cause they kill here
This music, it kill fear
I use it, when I need to hear
Been there, done that
Drop the shit, they gon' run it back
Simple shit, man I'm done with that
Fake rap, take it back
My chain heavy, got a lot of money
My bitch bad, have fun with that
I've been there and don't want it back
If I see the bitch I might run it back
Cause

[Hook]
I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long
I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long, I'm gone
(Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it)

[Verse 2]
So what now, (so what now), let's get down
Let's get drowned, on this vision, my division is the greatest that's around
Feel the vibe (feel the vibe)
This is where I'mma be for as long as I'm alive
I could vibe with this, fuck around and die for this
But would you ride for this? Better ride, no lie for this
They say "what's your motivation?"
Cutting these records like back in the basement
Boy fuck a vacation, we do this for love, not no validation

[Pre-Hook]
Living like this is so crazy, this world is amazing
One day you're raw on top and the next she having your baby
Living life like this I get down, uh, when they come around, uh
I do my best to fall back and not, not make a sound

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Wanna get it like this
(I think so) when I'm driving, (I drink slow) when I'm vibing
(You never know, know, know, know)
I got it, posted up at the crib with something exotic
I don't smoke but she love to smoke
And look good as fuck when she light it
When she ride it, it's crazy, love when I get inside it
Baby stop tryna hide it, if the feeling's there then abide it
Baby girl, where you been? I don't know
I feel like this is the moment, I mean it feel like it don't it?
Shit girl I know that you want it
But fuck all that
Take the time to get down, stop all that running around
I'm feeling you feeling me, know that you into me
Baby girl let me get down, cause my mind gone
That's the type of shit that I'm on
Grip the mic and I go (whoo!)
Fuck around with this flow

[Pre-Hook + Hook]

[Outro: Thalia]
Making a single before your album is like putting together a trailer for a movie you have yet to shoot[Intro: Danny Brown]
I could never be your friend
No way that I could pretend
I give it one hundred from the start to the end
Roll with my day ones and thats how it is
I could never be your friend
No way that I could pretend
I give it one hundred from the start to the end
Roll with my day ones and thats how it is

[Chorus: Portugal. The Man]
But i can’t even be your friend
I can't even be your friend
I can't even be your friend
I can’t even be your friend
I can't even be your friend
I can't even be your friend

[Verse 1: Danny Brown]
You ain't got nothin on me
You ain't got nothin on me
Hell no we ain't homies
Smoke that kush all by my lonely
I can't trust none of these niggas
All for self my nigga go figure
If you ain't bout them figures
Then no i can't get whitcha
But you ain't gettin salvation
Magazine and that pistol
And another way that you trippin
You ain't gettin subscriptions
Thats what I stay to myself
Everyone they care for theyself
If you ain't helpin my wealth
Then its best that you just step
I just smoke and drink til i pass out
Everybody wanna hand out
Got bandz on me no cashin out
Stay low key like a stash house
Drivin round with them racks out
Make the girlfriend tap out
With her back out till she blacked out
Now she comin back like a crack house
I could never be yo friend
No way that I could pretend
I give it one hundred from the start to the end
Roll with my day ones and thats how it is
I could never be yo friend
No way that I could pretend
I give it one hundred from the start to the end
Roll with my day ones and thats how it is

[Chorus: Portgual. The Man]
But i can’t even be your friend
I can't even be your friend
I can't even be your friend
I can’t even be your friend
I can't even be your friend
I can't even be your friend

[Verse 2: Portugal. The Man]
Your mama's got nothing on me
Your daddy's got nothing on me
And the world that sleeps in its lunacy has got nothing on me
No stars got nothing on me
Your son's got nothing on me
And the fool who sees it's the thief that leads has got nothing on me
You know it's not because the light here gets brighter
And it's not that I'm evil
I got a friend in the devil
But I can't even be your friend

[Chorus: Portgual. The Man]
But i can’t even be your friend
I can't even be your friend
I can't even be your friend
I can’t even be your friend
I can't even be your friend
I can't even be your friend

[Outro: Danny Brown]
I could never be yo friend
No way that I could pretend
I give it one hundred from the start to the end
Roll with my day ones and thats how it is
I could never be yo friend
No way that I could pretend
I give it one hundred from the start to the end
Roll with my day ones and thats how it is[Hook]
Things change when you grow up
Now everybody want to show up
Talkin' 'bout, 'I knew that you would blow up'
When I was young, my favorite song was 'Get money, get money' Weight of the world on my shoulder
But I'm still gettin' colder, so keep it real

[Verse 1]
Like, on a comedy about who run rap
Cause L.A. is on top now and who run that?
I've been all facts, I base my shit off that
But for sixty-five grand, y'all could switch my hat
To the Seahawks cause I'm always down for the money
And niggas always talkin' 'bout me when they strugglin'
I guess that's why my champagne always bubblin'
Two girls in the indoor pool out in London
At Dizzee Rascal flat, they say I’m a handsome cat
But all he do is rap, you want to hang out and relax?
Go shoppin' in Saks, hella bags in the back
And when I see her again, motherfucker, she next
I don't talk to her everyday, but we text
And when I throw that Biggie on, she don't even trip
I asked her to roll a joint and she don't even flinch
Dom K. is a pimp, you don't even need the blimp
I know you could tell I'm nasty, though my lyrics is classy
I'm not really that flashy, but I do like shrimp
Wit' some lemon butter sauce and a cold white Zinf
Somebody to talk to and share a view like this
Cause I been rollin' fashions, at least them attraction
Got dressed up for me, I do appreciate that, woah

[Hook]
Things change when you grow up
Now everybody want to show up
Talkin' 'bout, 'I knew that you would blow up'
When I was young, my favorite song was 'Get money, get money'
Birthdays was the worst days
Now we sip champagne when we thirsty
That's for real, and that's for real

Things change when you grow up
Now everybody want to show up
Talkin' 'bout, 'I knew that you would blow up'
When I was young, my favorite song was 'Get money, get money'
That's for real, and that's for real[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
She keep talking 'bout getting plastic surgery
I really hope she don't
And I wish I was the type that really enjoyed writing you notes
Video wit' Quik and Suga Free, but that wasn't no boat
Them yachts out in Newport, tell me, 'Who on your boat?'
While niggas lie about it, my soul girls cry about it
I'm not a member of Black Hippy, but I recognize higher power
You could eat pickles that's sour and sit in L.A. for hours
And you still wouldn't know what it felt like back in '91
And at 3:25, that's when my pops known to drive
Somebody said I should look for a house out in Oceanside
I'm from OPM, baby, got to get that straight
So you know it turn me on, I see her fix my plate
Told her, 'Look at the album cover if you ever miss my face'
I hope I'm on that shit like Eric B. and Rakim, sucker
Her mom said, 'Cut that song, uh, yeah, that is bumpin''
'Bout time you found somebody out here
That's really sayin' somethin'

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
I think I'm addicted to dippin' down Normandie
This could've been distributed by Priority
Instead we keepin' all the royalties
I stopped wearin' chains cause niggas' shit lookin' foily
And I heard what Chris Brown said, but I dick her down loyally
I have to interrupt, lookin' at your spoiled butt
Only raised by women, so you got waist and rhythms
To get my attention through a dashboard
Why you think little teenage boys always crash more?
Lookin' at the new 11s, thinkin' 'bout gettin' cash
Or waitin' on hoes to start shakin' that ass more
I’ve never been to Cannes, France, but i made movies on my black
L.A. New Era hat and Shawn Stussy
Aw, fuck it, I can't tell y'all shit, except, 'Get to it'
Gangsters used to wear nice shirts and drive big Buicks
Now this nigga on the Internet tryin' to pitch music
Nobody want to hear that shit[Produced by Jake One]

[Intro: Dr. Dre]
Yeah, classic hip hop shit
Dr. D-R-E, Rozay and Jay, let's get 'em

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
We started out mopping floors
And now we front row at the awards
Number one for the last twenty years
If you real, mothafucka scream cheers!
Mothafucka scream cheers!
Heh, and it is what it is
He wanted to shine at the swap meet
Til the white boys got him in that hot seat
I only love it when her hair long
You should listen to this beat through my headphones
Money long, number one twenty years strong
Fuck a gym, I am him, I'm Andre Young
G5эs to 64эs, Dre got 'em
If the bitch bad I got her in red bottoms
Great weed, nice homes, bread proper
Tec nine, one chamber, top shotta
Bentley coupe, new yacht, my helicopter
Born broke, real nigga straight out of Compton
The fuck you magazine niggas want from me?
I rewrote the game, nigga, now talk money
All black on my Al Capone shit
I built a house, nigga get your own shit
I only love it when her hair long
You should listen to this beat through my headphones

[Interlude: Rick Ross]
See y'all niggas
Hit the switches on that shit one time, ugh
Let the top down

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I came a long way from the weed game
Twenty stack seats at the Heat game
And I'm still strapped with the heat man
Can't be steppin' on a nigga feet man
80 pair of sneakers came from the D game
Cousin was a Crip, said it was a C thing
Brown bag money in a duffle bag
Fuck 'em all, wet 'em and we gotta double back
The homie whippin' chickens in his momma kitchen
On the mission, said he get it for his son tuition
Real nigga's dreams comin' to fruition
Stumble, but I never fall, leanin' on my pistol
I only love it when the ass fat
We should listen to this track in my Maybach
I'm just tryin' to be a billionaire
Come and suck a dick for a millionaire

[Interlude: Jay-Z]
Uh, it's just different
I know it feels different

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Uh, I only love her if her eyes brown
Play this shit while you play around with my crown
King H-O, y'all should know by now
But if you don't know, uh
Millions on the wall in all my rooms
Niggas couldn't fuck with my daughter's room
Niggas couldn't walk in my daughter's socks
Banksy bitches, Basquiat
I ran through that buck fifty Live Nation fronted me
They workin' on another deal, they talkin' two hundred fifty
I'm holdin' out for three
Two seventy five and I just might agree
Ex-D-boy, used to park my Beamer
Now look at me, I can park in my own arena
I only love her if her weave new
I'm still a hood nigga, what you want me to do?
Been hoppin' out the BM with your BM
Taking her places that you can't go with your per diem
Screamin' carpe diem until I'm a dead poet
Robin Williams shit, I deserve a golden globe bitch!
I take a Ace in the meanwhile
You ain't gotta keep this Khaled, it's just a freestyle
Fuck rap money, I've made more off grapes
Fuck show money, I spent that on drapes
Close the curtains, fuck boy, out my face
I whip the coke, let the lawyer beat the case
Murder was the case that they gave me
I killed the Hermes store, somebody save me
Stuntin' to the max like wavy, oh shit!
Oh, stuntin' to the max, I'm so wavy
Used to shop at TJ Maxx back in '83
I don't even know if it was open then
I ain't know Oprah then
Have the XL 80 bike
Loud motor, they be like, "Damn!" when I'm comin' through, rrraaanngg
Had the grill in '88, y'all niggas is late
You got all that, right?
I love this shit like my own daughter
Let's spray these niggas, baby, just like daddy taught ya
Young, this is just different[Produced by Jake One]

[Verse 1: J Cole]
Yeah grew up with killers, I didn't know they was killers
We was just together man, playing Mega-man on Sega man
Your mama loved me to death, she reminded me of Afeni
Yeah real black queen
If I had a genie
I wish that she ain't struggle no more
Y'all wouldn't have to go to sleep with all the roaches if she wasn't so poor
You told me when you came to my house
This shit was like a timeout from reality
One night you asked me what I'm crying about
'cuz you was staying over for the weekend
I woke up from out my sleep
When I heard mama and my stepfather beefin
I don't know if he been drinkin
But I know this shit got loud and I heard rumbling from struggling
And rolling on the ground
Could never get used to that sound
My mama saying get off me
My tears is tumbling now
I wish that you never saw me
'Cuz I felt like a coward, so powerless I was only 12
I wish I would've bust through that door my fucking self
And grab the Glock right off the fucking shelf
If nothing else scared a nigga shitless
There goes two of my wishes
Forever scarred, determined to get some heart
No matter how big the nigga, no matter how small you are
Fast-forward to our older years
Two different paths
You used to talk to me about college but that shit didn't last
Waste of potential, getting cash, what could I say?
So tired of not having things, you never see it my way
Too proud to fold
Your demise
One day much to my surprise, my nigga called me, told me you just caught a body twice your size
I asked if it was self defense, he said it was defense of pride
And that they trying to give you ten, but if you lucky you'll do five damn
Not my nigga
The same one that told me that things always get better
Just trust me, don't cry my nigga
The news call him a killer, but he my nigga
Sad shit
Ay yo genie last wish, free my nigga[Verse]
Y'all see trends and pretend
I'm a veteran which means I'm pre-trend
Hand grown beats, sweetened, weakened, and watered down
I lead men, never follow clowns
Most time my soul speaks, then I jot it down
Therefore, most weekends I'm out of town
First class seat, feet seldom on the ground
'Less I'm in the V, she got her pedal to the ground
I do not friend and de-friend, I'm all around
Keep them 'till the end, go every round
Now, got a couple dead homies but no ex-homies
Once I give my word by that I'm bound
Racks on racks is in my hands, my cash is in advance
I don't just put it all in my raps, it's in my pants or
Tucked under the mattress or in the bank
I ain't telling y'all exactly, I'm more savvy than you think
I walked around with gats and carried a little shank
Cause the world treat me bad and I couldn't afford a shrink
Shit was rough, I scribbled it in my books
They say you must be independent cause your image sucks
They say necessity's a bitch
Or the mother of all inventions, you take your pick
Either way I ain't afraid to take a risk
So that's the one I made my babies with
They saying light skin is in style, dark skin is in style
How come white folks always in style though? Huh
You can check the file but you know what's never in style?
Fat Muslim rapping albinos, uh, yeah I know
I only love her if she in the struggle
I can't relate to a woman who's never been through nothing
High, saddity, privileged and soft
They pretty but they always say something to piss me off
My heart's forever with the underdog
Who got nothing to give except for love accord
You should listen to this when you're occupying
? frontlining
Even if you don't join us in the Ramadan
Starving the one thing we all got in common
That's why I'm not styling on 'em
Righteous dude in a Maybach I'm Stalley on 'em
More like a four-door Honda on 'em
Put my baby mama through college on 'em
Off a type of rhyming they find inspiring
I'm not a boss on a yacht, I'm Basquiat
Before I finish the rhyme, you start rewinding
Cause everything that drops out my mind's a diamond
I'm only rocking the bling that's in my chin
Diamonds and gin, to shining from within
That's some shit the poor people say
Maybe so but it's true for me either way
You can ask your man Hov if I'm blinging
He gotta admit it (Uh, it's just different)
The best verse on a song I ain't even on
It's either now, 4th king, never steer you wrong
Reporting live, A-L-I, your brother
Mourning in America, dreaming in color[Produced by Jake One]

Worldwide shit
We all over the globe
Y'all know, Freezer

[Verse 1]
I traveled from overseas back, Free's back, to each his own
I had the business sense to lead back home
I chatted in the jet like Special Ed I flown
Back to Africa, too bad I had to leave my chrome
Passport on file, condo by the Nile
The camera tried to follow this top model to Cairo
Get a few female Top Models to swallow
When they finished with Tyra
Then then holla at the boy
Yeah, some of my homeland's ravaged from the war
It's vital that I visit some spots out of The Bible
I'm by the Red Sea, not the Dead Sea
All tracks get destroyed like Sodom and Gomorrah

[Refrain]
It don't matter where you at, it's matters where you from
That's why I spit hood raps over African drums
You gotta rep where you from, no matter where you be
That's why I spit street raps over African beats
It don't matter where you at, it's matters where you from
That's why I spit hood raps over African drums
I shut it down and leave with your Queen to be

[Verse 2]
Witches in the tuck like the young King Tut
I was dusting the murder tracks while they were wrapping him up
He was ruling over Egypt
Now I'm on my way to be ruling over rap, body people on they remix
I got the belt flow would leave Michael Phelps seasick
I'm chasing wealth, people like who the hell he is
It's L-E-S, Freezer his L-E-S
Flow is just as wet as the Arabian Sea is
I post up in the Arabian Peninsula
I'm a Muslim, I follow the Sunnah and never deviant
Thaw, other rappers do not have the ingredients
Not wicked with the tongue like young Free is

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
It's the rap Prince Akeem, your mom's dream
In other countries I'm always heard but not seen
Except for the internet but I'm a store force em
Different cities monthly
I'm going on a world tour
These other rappers' flows getting old but not Free's
I got a hold, I'm in control, y'all sloppy
I like my hoes pigeon-toed, knock-kneed
Bring it home for papi
Rock and roll
Pop, lock and drop it
Like Nia Long
They coming short with the profit
I lock and load
Stay in touch with the right broads via phone
These other niggas they might blow but we explode, yeah

[Refrain][Verse 1: Monoxide]
I know you hate it
Butcher knife is serrated
Ever since second grade
I've been murder infatuated, morbidly fascinated
So keeping me medicated is prolly the only way
That I'm ever safe to come play with
Hard to understand like I'm speaking another language
To people who never wrapped up a body inside a blanket
And heave it into a river with heavy shit
That'll take it to the bottom
I'm telling y'all
Hang with the downtrodden
And causing your town problems
I'm feeding your broad condoms
Full of my cum squadrons
Come from a long column of wrong
So please don't be surprised when you see what my chain saw
Addicted to getting brain from dumb broads with smart mouths
And keep away from them bumb froads that go all out
And I'm rap's equivalent to a chemical fallout
And I'm only here to let the demon dogs out

[Hook]
I'm a little...
I'm a little bit fucked up in the head
I'm little... I'm a little...
I'm a little bit fucked up in the head

[Verse 2: Jamie Madrox]
Who wanna see they skulls outside of they face?
Tuck they tongue inward just to see how they soul tastes
Fingers through they temples, touching brains as they meditate
In a cannibalistic, pessimistic, zombie-like state
Overcome by night and infected by the sickness
My mind's lights out, total darkness - it brings the wicked
Like a soul weaver, weaving in and out of consciousness
Like a nightmare you can't contain in your sleep, so picture this
In a room full of blood, a headless body on the wall
Is it your body? Where's your head?
It must be down the hall, is it tangled in intestines?
Screaming and trying to reconnect
In hopes of reanimating a head to a severed neck
I'm a madman, ink blots look like malice and havoc
A couple buckles short of my straightjacket
I'm manic depressant - in an essence, I'm fucked up
Can't blast images that appear, and the voices never stop
Even when I cover my ears

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jamie Madrox]
I never said that I was sane
Something inside my brain got me crazy
Fuck, call me deranged
Fuck, label me weird and strange
There's a thousand voices that say
I should take my broken mind and maybe just do away with it
Fuck it, give me another minute
I'll be laughing, making a casket, laying my ass in it, so
Fuck it, forget it, I've already made it and laid in it
And nothing's different, my head keeps spinning and I keep grinning

[Verse 4: Monoxide]
Cuz I'm a lunatic laughing
Right from the beginning all the way to the nuthouse
I be the opposite of winning but right now
I'm only here to kidnap women and children, and turn the lights out
I'm giving a hundred degrees of insanity, please
Go get your kids and your wife out
It's only seconds until I go get the knives out
And I told you I'm a couple bulbs short up in my lighthouse

[Hook][Produced by Jake One]

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
Now if I give you all of me, what'chu gonna give me back?
Your body is calling me, got me feeling like a fiend on crack
Boy you gonna make me fall in love, now why you wanna go and do that?
Now if I give you all of me, tell me what'chu gon' give me back?

[Verse 1]
Let's start with the moon and the stars, whatever you into
The money I acquire, mama, make it all simple
Flashback '03, paparazzi flashing flicks
I moved away, hustle hard, now I got a sick stash
Tell me you miss me, baby come here and kiss me
Mwah - it just happened so quickly
Feels like I hopped off a bus and got in a Bentley
It's gangsta my music, even when it's the smooth shit
You can hate me cause I hurt you, but I ain't mean to do it
Em predicted it all, I don't know how he knew it
He said women from Hollywood, they liar-liar-liars
You fuck 'em they, get you heated, deny you like Mariah
Fast forward to '06, I'm still on fire
The world is still turning, my records are still earning
Dough come quicker and quicker, flow gets sicker and sicker
Straight up and down, baby, I'm a special kind of nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Life is short, baby, be a part of my dreams
I own Ferrari horses, my Lamborghini leans
So mean, I have niggas hating on me
God gave me a gift, I'm supposed to be rich
I'm supposed to ride through the hood and make niggas sick
When my homies put in work, they supposed to get hit
With a piece of chain thick and go and buy 'em some bricks
I ain't make that up, this is how it's 'sposed to be kid
You should feel like a lifer that get back that time
When I smile your smile should be as big as mines
Girl to know me is to love me, I'm one of a kind
Even when you hate me you love me, forever you're mine

[Hook]

[Outro: Mary J. Blige]
What you gonna give me back?
You're gonna make me fall in love
What you gon' give me, what you gon' give me, what you gon' give meSo I never told the world that the first time I toured
I came home to find that little man had been ignored
Two years old got a hold of water you had boiled
And burned his little head and his face while you snored

You were afraid of bringing him to the hospital
‘Cause two weeks ago your mom called the cops on you
Child protection paid a visit
Ruled that the crib was unfit to raise kids in

I’m working ten hour days at the gig then
You were unemployed all null and void
Now I ain’t trying to be no Sigmund Freud
But ain’t you supposed to have instincts when it comes to the boy

I called a cab and took him to county hospital
They shaved hair and burnt flesh off his skull
Held him overnight to fight infection
I slept sitting up in a chair directly next to him

I just knew you would join us but instead
Hopped your ass on the bus went home and went to bed
That’s the very moment I divorced you in my head
God might forgive you for that I never did

All you need right now

Faheem we can see the throne from here
I may never sit there but brother you’re the heir
Pull up a chair let pop bend your ear
Here baby dry those tears

I know you wonder why your mother does the things that she do
Well it’s not because she doesn’t love you
It’s because she grew up in something they call foster care
That’s when strangers raise you your mom’s not there

Imagine how she felt when she was your age
Going from place to place never feeling safe
Never having love never having faith
She probably thought the world was a big scary place

Where was her mommy at well that’s kind of sad
She used drugs to forget the problems she had
There was a new one back then they called crack
Once you try it there was almost no coming back

She couldn’t be the mommy she wanted to be
She was chasing a high all in the street
Won’t tell you no lie real is all I can be
I believe only truth can set you free

There’s a whole lot of pain in your bloodline
But there’s a whole lot of strength in the sunshine
Lean back let the new day greet you
‘Cause you’re standing on the shoulders of a people

Who been beat down and treated unequal
But the prayer that they made now has reached you
It’s plain to see it’s true
Beautiful prince I wish they could see you

All you need right now[B-Real (Sen Dog):]
Ready? set, go! I'm ready to run
Steady we get though, under the sun
About to let go. - Show me respect though!
It's gon' be a fat joint. - Soul - in your mental. (soul - in your mental!)
We came from the bottom and rose to the top
Like the cream in your coffee - burning hot! (burning hot!)
Climbing the Billboards for the number one spot
King of the block - stop for a second to watch!
Look and learn and loose your knot
No more bottles to pop, no birds in the drop
But - we still rollin'! (we still rollin'!) - Pocket's swollen. (pockets swollen!)
We're - locked and loaded, then the scene exploded
We' - solid as ever on any endeavour
Cypress Hill forever, doesn't get any better!
We - came and saw. - And conquered it all! (conquered it all!)
We're hungry for more like the kids in Darfur. (like the kids in Darfur!)

[Hook: B-Real]
We live hard, still armed and dangerous!
We young love, be alarmed, don't play with us!
Play the song! Gotta bounce just to stay with us!
Come along, hit the bong and blaze with us!

[Sen Dog:]
I'm the dog and I'm undisputed. - And you've been recruited!
I'm the general that your boy saluted. (that your boy saluted!)
Give you a minute to see how we do it (how we do it!)
You've never seen such finesse cause you're so polluted. (you're so polluted!)
I'm the king in this area hombre
Knocked 'em out the park when I'm standing on home plate. (c'mon!)
So many years of blood sweat and tears
Without me the dogs stay switching the gears!
But I'm still the same man from back in the day
And I'm still gettin' luck from Africa to L.A.! (to L.A.!)
Jake One hit play; burst started to sway
Every time I leave the city fools want me to stay! (want me to stay!)
Cause they stay loyal, so it's harder to go
And like the lights. - I got's to grow!
That means I'll roll (I'll roll!) but I'll return later (I'll return later!)
Give props to my peop (le), and buckshots to haters. (buck, buck!)

[Hook x2]

[B-Real (Sen Dog):]
Raise your hands in the air like you're supposed to
And everybody scream like you're on a rollercoaster
We're down - with the Costra Nostra
We smashing! - We sick jackin' and the Soul Assassins. (Soul Assassins!)
The Hip-hop culture - we fuck you both
Just as you caught in the rapture. - All I hear is laugher. (all I hear is laughter!)
In a year's time some of you punks, won't matter!
Let's see - if you can hang if you can climb the ladder!
You ain't a rapper, you're a fucking joke! (you're a fucking joke!)
A one-shock hack on a track, get your pass revoked! (get your pass revoked!)
I got keys to the city and we locking you out
We come hard for the paint. - And I'm blocking you out!
So run for the hills and hide in the can
We just put the mic' down - and be that fan. (and be that fan!)
With your - petty hands outside the lobby
I'm a pro, get my signature, this ain't no hobby!

[Hook x2]Let me talk to him!
Let me talk to him!
Talk to me!

[Verse 1]
I’m from the era were we murk the bearer of bad news like Leonidas
And family don’t speak till tragedy reunite us
Scout to see who tightest and slay hordes
Who wanna test V.A. sword
I wanna meet the Fockers
No Gaylord
An angelic presence the delegates blessing
It’s hell against heaven
My flow is god’s relic in essence
Why in the fuck is you replicas testin
With a delicate pressin
I can blow you to maggot delicatessen
They restless til I’m soul clapped with no mercy
Till they witness the crown get hold captive and murk me
No industry flow active can hurt me
The upper echelons about effective as proactive to herpes
Instruct spit to keep niggas with chalk employed
The gods fully armored
Apology talk is void
What part beast you don’t understand
I write the sickest shit to hit white sheets since cross burning Caucasoid

[Hook]
V, a verse for all the fallen that left me
A, may the armor of god protect me
Kill everything thing that’s movin expect me
If you offended then I’m talking to you directly

[Verse 2]
Sick as an abortion activist germ biochemist
Strapped by yo clinic
Clappin’ clients with a grill that’s cryogenic
The ice that my tear ducts cry authentic enough to hypothermia what I
Breathe upon even freeze a pond
The game will never be fixed
Cause every new nigga heavily bricks
Or exploited like 70′s flicks
Machine and beast cleverly mixed so
Fuck around and get carried by six
Like the nuggets in 76
I’m a good fucka
A sick migraine cross contaminated with strychnine strains and click
Nines aimed
Split a soul three ways in an auction
You celebrity fit thugs weighing your luck and weighing your options
Subsequently no slugs can dent me
Spit freeze whatever rubs against me I creep like a stealth winter
Frost bitin shit till your health splinters
This is I, fill in you the blank lord and master bitch I’m self-centred

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Niggas want me to rehash beef with Twista till the targets destroyed
Run up on him at 106 & Park with the toy
Fuck all that, that’s a marketing ploy
In fact, I’m proud of what the nigga accomplished
Bark at cha boy
Envy breeds from not stackin right
Non packin pipe
Insecure non tough, tough actin tinactin types
You clients of panda pussy pimpin
The source of your extinction in existence is right here in black and white
Till I’m emancipated, I birthed terror that stans Al-Qaeda
Switch up, give a fuck if fans okayed it
All I got is my balls and my word
If the streets hold me to my word, we already know where your hands located
Your fears confirming my thesis
The time fabrics in permanent creases
Pressing the luck you weigh
When bucks spray, you lay
Uckfay ouyay
Want some positive shit?
Mother fucker play Lupe

[Hook][Intro: Eminem]
What the Fuck?
Hey yo Whoo Kid run that shit back
GOD DAMN!

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Guess who's back motherfucker I’m back (yeah)
Guess who's back motherfucker I’m back
Yeah listen
Now I’m a do this like my life depend it on it
My kids and my wife depend it on it
Everything in life I wanted I own it
I can keep my feet up and relax if I wanted it too
But I’m back in the lab making my next murder move
Giving a murderer something to go and murder too
So they can celebrate when they're making the breaking news
Niggas hate when you’re elevating your making moves
A lots changed, the same game with different rules
Make a nigga cold hearted, niggas they got it losted
Niggas better be conscious, nigga better be softly
We ain’t taking no losses, bigger deals means bigger office
The blue steel keep them niggas off us
I blew the trial because I hung the jury
Shit look what them streets done done to me

[Hook: Sly]
In a stone cold world I’m living yeah
This is what you want yeah
What you make me
Got shoot to survive will I make it out?
Got shoot to survive should I burn it down?
Back is the wall I’ma get it off
Streets teach no mercy
Look what it created a murderer
Just like the DJ when I turn it up
Back against the wall I’ma get it off

[Verse 3: Slim The Mobster]
Yeah I’ma get it off like kobe at the buzzer
Take it back to the gutter turn powder in the butter
Watch the money pile up I’ma certify hustler
And I will go out the G way boy what you expect
Oh money one of them freeway boys
I make bundles off of bundles ran the ball never fumble
Playin’ in the convict jungle apply pressure till they crumble
A quarter pound of the hundo, fuck around and my gun go
Clip tall as the jungle, my Uzi weigh a ton though
Introducing my young ho to taking bags out the Louis store
Brand new convertible she probably never seen before
Oh yeah I'm leaning low Niggas know I'm scheming though
And put bullets wherever that the Beamer go
Blew a few hundred thousands for my new jewellery
Look what the streets gone done to me

[Hook][DOOM]
HMMMM
The flow was towin' with precision as an afro trim
All big letters but isn't no acronym
Smack the thin grin off a chin for crack smoking
DDT the first bar, leave this track back broken
Chrome grown man doing business with anglo-sax'n'them
Lacking swing but that banjo's so relaxing
As the wax spin, hacking axes in the wind
Pretend it's just a pen, see if you can pencil 'em in
Tense, mention men of honor fenced in
Census is tens, the wheels fall off then it's the end
Don't get keelhauled in
Villain always been, feel real genuine ballskin
Not to call the whole crowd out
It's just a few chumps, and you know who you are like a shoutout
Place 'em in your loud mouth and taste 'em like a pastry
Waste of space face hastily bow out gracefully
Disappear, reappear and disappear again
Villain not his hair, he's no afro-american
If that's the case he be a bald-headed African
Taking all the credit and jetted, astro travelling
Turn a man into a mannequin for AFLAC'n
And being tough acting Tinactin bluff jacking
He wears a mask so when he dogs his face
Each and every race, could absorb the bass
In the place to be, don't believe the hyperbole
It's like a murder spree, get sniped verbally
Or beat in the head with lead pipe languages
For street cred leave him for dead in anguishments
The slang suggest it was the guy in the glasses
Who came to help the people with they minds and they asses
You set trip and get a grip like Spalding
These walls is thin, feel genuine ballskinY'all know what it is...
That's right...Copywrite yo...Tage yo...
We're here to greet y'all haters, with open arms, with the clip out
Aight I'm just livin' while haters let it get them jealous
It's like my man Tage said, matter fact ima? let him tell it

[Verse 1:Tage]
Developing new alchemy megas on the balcony
No none of y'all amount to we as soon as you count to three its 'bout to be on
He stood on a roof steady telling y'all he's part of proof
They the truth like sodium brevital get a clue
Tryna get across smooth set it off through the mainstream
But he can't seem to get a better view
Left the crew met a few coerced 'em to paint a different picture of himself
Till his shit hits the shelf
A so so'd hoes flow this flow blowed
In his own world gassed by fake niggas and his own girl
Gas made it hard to see soon as infantry partially brought out
Rhymes rarely thought out he's caught out
His shit sank in six months we stopped listening
His old crew got a major deal dissin him
He's pissin in the wind that we blow
Any particular city we leaving young people restless like Genoa City
Hear me we squeeze tough till it's mush and the pus starts to gush
You get crushed by some niggas like us fo sho
Cause this game has converted angry feminists to promiscuous polygamous
Suggest you consider this or get burnt tryna be heroic
You one of many statistics it's the same shit different toilet now

These hard times got us putting bars to beats
So stressed I can hardly sleep
Won't let these bitches tempt me
The fridge is empty and I hardly eat
Everyone who starves these streets
Even lame cats claim that they deserve a part to eat
What part of the game is that
It's the part of the game the rules they hardly read
Now listen

[Verse 2: Copywrite]
All around the globe the same old song
Think this shit'll change you got the game all wrong
The same day an NBA rookie shoots his first three point shot
A seasoned vets knee joints lock
And once your parents breed dog
You ain't guaranteed shit except some air to breath smog
And some guaranteed shit
A new day another light grey hair
It's like a millionaire tryna take a bus to heaven when life ain't fair
And when you're rock bottom somebody's on top
Sometimes somebody gets signed somebody gets dropped
Its lottery odds save your first mil
While he just spent his last dollar on the tape you made ya cash off of
Might ??? but if you never felt pain I feel for ya
That first raw deal taught ya it's some real torture
I smoke with myself pull gats in the mirror
Sometimes tell jokes to myself and laugh in the mirror
I feel like I'm going insane not knowing my brain
Can hold and sustain the pain that comes from growing in age
Knowin noone can lower the flames or open the clouds
Also knowin my style never been to throw in the towel
Plus I'm done walking that line between gettin jerked and payin dues
And stayin true really depends on what ya say and do
So say you pop shit by breakfast, get buried by lunch
Ya mouth wrote a check you can't cash with unverified funds

These hard times got us putting bars to beats
So stressed I can hardly sleep
Won't let these bitches tempt me
The fridge is empty and I hardly eat
Everyone who starves these streets
Even lame cats claim that they deserve a part to eat
What part of the game is that
It's the part of the game the rules they hardly read
Now listen[50 Cent]
I, know, you, know
I'm, on, fire

[Hook: 50 Cent]
If, you don't know, who I be
You better ask somebody about me
Oh, you wanna be tough nigga, a look is enough
I put that snub nose to ya and bust nigga
If, you don't know, who I be
You better ask somebody about me
And they'll tell ya I'm a soldier boy
And I done told ya, over and over boy

[Verse One: Lloyd Banks]
I come from a big city, the streets corrupt
Now I'm rollin' with snub-noses to heat you up
Out here niggas'll do anything to reach a buck
Cause when you broke you can't afford to fuck ya sneakers up
I take my time, keep my mind on my bank funds
Learn how to separate the real from the fake ones
And on my heater nina rep what could I carry on
My nigga just lost his momma, and his daddy gone
From now on I can provide cause my paper's straight
Family losin' his legs, but I can take the weight
Some niggas hate but I'll be damned if they hold me down
Front niggas didn't know me then, bet they know me now
Blunt and a smile, eventually it'll be a frown
Cause every time I turn around a nigga locked down
While I'm in the world, tryin to bring my loot through
Hopin' one day we can kick it like we used to, my nigga

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Young Buck]
Uhh, they never seen 26's on a Hummer
My goal is to try to fuck Trina by the summer
Some niggas hate me, but they only made me
Go and put mo' ice in my mouth than Baby
G-Unit and Shady, them dudes is crazy
Next time, we only usin' Dr. Dre's beats
Fuck you, pay me, take your magazine flicks
This ain't no Nelly hurr, take a good look at this
Got the wrists of a chemist and the heart of a hustler
Plus I probably done robbed mo' artists than Russell
Always in trouble, you can blame my mother
Gave birth to a gorilla and raised him in the jungle
I ain't crawled, I stumbled across the Mexican with birds
Papi had coke and new plates and pounds of herb
Keep my hand on my Glock, and my ear to the streets
I'm a country boy, you can hear it when I speak
G-Unit!

[Hook]

[Verse Three: 50 Cent]
Bentley Azure dreams, G-5 agenda
The hood had made a nigga heart colder than December
Don't take much to make my gun go off
One shot'll make a hardrock look oh so soft
If you don't know you better ask who I be
Or end up in ICU gettin' fed through a IV
Down in the Lou', they say they feelin' me dirty
In New Orleans they say I'm that nigga, ya heard me?
From them Southside blocks to Watts, Westside don't front
You know about them Grapestreet Gangstas, G'd up
Rollin that weed up
Nigga get outta line, get shot stabbed jacked
Hit with a bat or beat up
Fuck that, we're on that same bullshit
Same forty-cally Glock, same full clip
Pussy claat bwoy, ya nah wanna tak wif me
I'm a real rudebwoy, ya nah wanna ruf wif me

[Hook][Intro: Tony Yayo]
Tougher than leather, nigga. I'm tougher than an African kid running bare-foot in the gullies, nigga. Know what I'm saying? Tough. OG now, nigga. Yeah. Yeah

[Verse 1: Tony Yayo]
To all living things around me
Cash rules everything around me
Your music is unenthusiastic
My jewelry glow in the dark
Škorpion from Serbia, catch you in traffic
20-round clip, curved magazine
And you could leave the Earth over small, little things
John Gotti hit the cake, go bada bing
And you ain't do shit when them things start to ring
South side, we outside, niggas kill, son
They'll Seattle Seahawk you, throwing bullets like Wilson

[Verse 2: Young Buck]
White sheets cover his feet, Ku Klux Klan'ed your man
Left him in the streets, strap in his left hand
The thought of even coming around here was a death plan
And if a nigga cosign that he a "yes man"
Shoot the fuck out of a fuck nigga, I'm all fucked up
So loser, I lose, the dice game getting stuck up
When shit real you get killed around here, it's not a big deal
Load her out, nigga, use my big bitch for a shield
(You know I'm saying?) Thank you for real

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy
When your mouth to be shooting
You find out that we been shooting all along
Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy
You get caught without that Ruger
We put hot shit through you then we gone
Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy
Boy, don't let me catch you slipping, boy, boy
Boy, you know I get to tripping, boy, boy
Boy,  don't let me strap that clip in, boy, boy
Boy, you know I get to tripping, boy, boy

[Verse 3: Tony Yayo]
My money up when them mills come
LA Reid with the dope, son, Jimmy Iovine with the coke, son
Wise time fly by, I'm an OG, bad bitch with double D's
Nigga, Jordan couldn't palm these, feel the breeze
Wrap 'em in satin, they be gone by the morning
Federal subpoenas while SWATs kick the doors in
Fuck up the sheets, the electric tapes to your door though
I show that bitch how to breathe under water
Excusez moi, French bitches bending over
Snatch 'em out the whip, throw 'em in the Range Rover
Snitches and phones, catch the 30 piece from the jewelry
[?] why they texting 'bout [?] body
Frank Lucas put flowers on Bump graves every Tuesday
That's loyalty and don't listen to everything your lawyer say
Red dot, surgery with the laser
Have a nigga missing like that plane from Malaysia

[Verse 4: Kidd Kidd]
Fo' fo's, long nose is Gonzo's
Hundred rounds, drum on the K, that's bongos
Running your mouth with deadly convos, I clap like, "bravo"
Bend back for the encore, nigga, huh
You pussy niggas think you got nine lives
I'mma make sure I stick you more than nine times
With that ice pick I'm a cold killer
You tucking your tail and growing whiskers, rat nigga

[Hook][Hook: Lyfe]
Woke up screaming fuck the world today I, had it up to here
Ex-girlfriend got custody today cause, they say she feels
That I'll never be the daddy that she, wants me to be
Hardest thing I've ever had to do, sayin bye to my seeds, ohhh

[Hook] w/ ad libs

[Young Buck]
Damn, look at what I call my life, a Glock-9
And a eightball of white, I got mine
Well, not quite, I got signed
And 50 put me right in the light, it took time
Meanwhile I'm livin the life
Where a nigga just might see prison tonight
My rent due, baby need food and shoes
I'm flat broke, still I refuse to lose
So I smoke, lookin for the fools with jewels
I'm 'bout to see if it's true what a uzi do
Nobody cares, and life ain't fair or free
The best thang you can do is say a prayer for me
And how dare, y'all try to lock me up
You not here, so you ain't really givin a fuck
But I swear, as long as I'm breathin, I'm hustlin
I'm thuggin, and this is the reason because I

[Hook]

[Lyfe]
If you see me in a suit and tie (in a suit and tie)
Tell all my niggas goodbye (tell my niggas goodbye)
Tell 'em that I'm on my wayyyyy (tell 'em I'm on my way man)
Say a prayer for me and hug the kids (hug the kids)
Tell God all of the shit I did (the shit I did)
And how the kids looked up to me (cause they did look up to me nigga!)
Yeahhhh

[Young Buck]
Heyyy - holla if you feel my pain
I been to hell and back, and I'm still the same
The block hotter than flames, but we sell the 'caine
Puttin all kind of thangs in our baby's name
Tell the hoes "I'm rich bitch" like my name Rick James
I really ain't got shit, but I can't complain
Cause L.T. got life, and Big Ju got fifty
Jimmy did his ten and D doin his twenty
Come get me, seems like it's no way out
So when I say "Dirty," you say "South"
Tryin to put my hands on somethin, brush off my shoulders
Buy up some land or somethin, get what they owe us
You don't have a plan, you're nuttin is what they told us
Remember what the O.G.'s showed to the soldiers
Gotta make it to heaven or die tryin to get it
The day dude fuck with Dre, I was feelin like

[Hook][Verse 1: Time]
I bought my first pack when I was only 8
I went to the store and put a 5 on fate
My heart started to race, I pulled out a Barkley
Then I high fived the clerk, Jordan dunking on Dan Majerle
Forget cloud 9 I was on the Upper Deck
I was unstoppable, like Olajuwon's stutter step
Magic Johnson Larry Bird, I pulled them from a Fleer pack
Then I got another Jordan, I couldn't hold the tears back
Now I'm addicted, the cellophane is ripping
Out my mind like Rodman praying for a Pippen
I used to sell all my doubles and my extras on the corner
Listening to tapes, by Styx, Pac, and Foreigner
The only book I ever used to read was the Beckett
All my cards were mint condition, I had to protect them
Cause every cards valuable, at least most are
Unless you get an ad or a Sam Bowie card
On Christmas I thought I went to heaven damn
Cause my mom and dad gave me a Michael Jordan hologram

[Hook: Giuseppe}
As I lay me down to sleep
I pray the lord my soul to keep
And if I die before I wake
I pray the lord my Jordan's safe

[Verse 2: Time]
Back in 95 my mom bought me a box
It was the whole 92 season from Topps
But not any old tops this was Topps with 2 P's
I was P Funk on NBA Jam with Bootsy
Boomshakalaka, I was dunking from half court
These gods made of cardboard were hard to ignore
I got LaPhonso's autograph by a Joslin's clothes rack
Then I went home and played ball till my Sprite went flat
Dad drank Dr. Pepper, mom made cookies
I was in my room praying for a Jordan rookie
Basketball cards in my spokes, yes I was troublesome
Under my desk at school, I'd hide my Topps bubblegum
Baseball saved us, basketball made us
Back in the day, I was nothing without my fade cut
I first found god in a pack, my memories are my wealth
Now I see him everywhere, even in myself

[Hook: Giuseppe}
As I lay me down to sleep
I pray the lord my soul to keep
And if I die before I wake
I pray the lord my Jordan's safe[Opening]
Chances... Right?
Okay

[Verse: Just]
These days it isn't even that I'm sad
It's that I don't find the "whys" on why I should be glad
Like all these other rappers rambling about this money
That to me it's pretty obvious these posers never had
Just, money, to fill dozens of bags
Or, just enough for me to buy that truck for my dad
It's, close enough for my mother to drop all the nagging
But not enough for my homies to have stopped all their bragging
I am!
Not sick,  actually I'm somewhere I go out of topic
Like my life seems so dark my friends think I'm gothic
As black clothing starts consuming my closet
And it's grown so much I fear its to late to stop it
Should I, drop it?
And change for fame and a profit?
If I'm saying anything that isn't Justin it's toxic
I've, seen so much, so why cover my sockets
I'm only able to do this when aware and I'm conscious
See, nowadays it's way more than stringing rhymes
Because I'm usually tied down to what is always in my mind
Like...Money, music, future, and the time
That everybody seems to waste though I ain't waisting mine
She says Justin you're just blinded
I say just know you're the fold
And I say Just know you're the fold
I say Just know you're the fold

[Outro: Just_J]
Yeah, Chances[Young Buck]
Aiyyo you niggas done ate long enough
G-UNIT! OHH!

[Hook]
AYYY, I'm the clean up man!
It ain't too many niggas that can do it like I can
When them records ain't sellin and the stitches start tellin
Motherfucker they yellin - GET 'EM BUCK!!
Grindin grindin, I can make it happen
Cause I'm - grindin grindin, I ain't only rappin
Man I'm - grindin grindin, you know who to call
I be - grindin grindin, this is for my dawgs

[Young Buck]
What's goin on with the Unit these days? (let 'em know)
Well I'mma tell you e'rybody gettin paid
And I hear you niggas talkin, prayin on our downfall
Took a couple losses, still we some outlaws
Ya bitch still lovin my swag
We let you niggas eat, why the fuck is you mad?
I never left the streets, I really ran to 'em
And since I know they watchin me I let my man do 'em
Money, a house and a bad bitch
Way 'fore the rap game man I had this (niggas know)
You don't know about bein broke
Standin on the block sellin fiends soap
Holla at me

[Hook]

[Young Buck]
Let's sip the 'gnac for a minute
Shawty you feelin this then put your back in it (hey!)
I'm back in it in an all-black fitted
In an all-black tinted-up drop top Bentley
Like - AYYY! You know what it is (yeah!)
I got my own jewelry baby, this ain't none of his (okay!)
Just holla when you NEED ME
Show a nigga love when you SEE ME
I can carry the weight, 50 just put it on my shoulders
G-Unit is the gang, I'm a motherfuckin soldier
They thought it was over, he let me out the cage (hey!)
So now they got me standin on this goddamn stage, like

[Hook]

[Young Buck]
Before I leave let me put this on your brain
If rap stop today, I still do my thang
I bought a Benz way before I bought me a chain
Took my momma out the Bricks and bought a car in her name
Paid my nigga Head bond just to get him on the streets
Hope if I get locked up niggas do it for me
Keep the project lights on, payin e'rybody bills
All my homies dead, I'm takin care of e'rybody kids
And I got this, you can count on me
To come through, when the home team down by three
I'm gon' shoot, and even if a nigga did miss
I bet you next quarter I'll be back in this bitch, like

[Hook] w/ ad libs

[Outro: Young Buck]
Yeah, y'know niggas out there
Nah nah, hold on
Y'know SOME niggas out there
Mighta thought the Unit was over or some shit
You niggas is losin your fuckin minds man, ha ha
Aiyyo man I got this shit right now, ya mean?
Get the FUCK out my lane, yeah
Y'know, that's why that nigga 50
That's why he got his feet kicked up right now
Ha ha, Sha Money I got you nigga
Straight up, so, oh yo
I'm expectin to be at the AWARDS this year!
Yeah...Thoughts rumblin’
Overseer’s is tumblin’
Town is talkin’
I’m walkin’
And sportin’
Soul as a comforter

On my shoulders
Metaphoric
I told ya
That lyrics are from spirit
Ain’t hear it
I made clearer

Now
Catch a look at the brow
If see that thing is raised
Then I’m makin’ em proud
If you see that thing is down
Then they making sound
If that shit is still steady tell that figure get ready

Enclosed wit some flows
That are set
To go
I’m imposed by some foes
That are quick to fold up
Know the approach
Ain’t just for show

I been overlooked
You guessed
Ima explode
Implode
Beyond measure

Ruler of wave that’s coming
At 12
Envisioned inchin’
Now I’m raved by public

Take notes
In full description
And hope
The past always pass
And don’t a scratch

Noted that I’m focused
Orgami spitta
Figures hopeless
The way I mold my motives
Fold these figures inta holstas

Posturize the image
That’ll later make me known as
A superficial soldier
With the goals of super novas

Uh
Mind twisted
Middle finger lifted
For the Folk Fiction Figures wit a witty remark

Go hard in light
Not a peep in the dark
And when the crowd steps in
Battered speech is re-taught

See the remorse
A few hours later
Manner over matter
Understandin’ imitators
Blinded by the glamour
So they pampered by nation
Role call
Let em know this art sacred

Face it
We live in a free world
Where figures tend to re-hurl
Substance on a referral
Changin’
Audible
I order to order figures
Pause with gander
Cut the slander
Start to listen

Print ain’t carbon
Bombin’
So I leave my mark
So the past know the present
And the future will talk

Bout the legacy that’s left
Discussion of best
Want my name in the topic
Everlasting effect

Tone
Oh that nice figure
Charter of a legend
So deceptive with the hintin’

Lootin’ is secluded
Think the movement easy pickin’
Reality
Formation could result in a tragedy

Do I have to be the greatest?
Was Jordan only happy cause he drafted in the 80’s?
Is Tiger in the Master’s cause he wanna win it maybe?
Crazy if you think it, see my vision isn’t tainted

C.O.N.C.E.P.T.Z
