[Verse 1: Drake]
Versace, Versace, Medusa head on me like I'm 'luminati
This is a gated community, please get the fuck off the property
Rap must be changin' cause I'm at the top and ain't no one on top of me
Niggas be wantin' a verse for a verse, but man that's not a swap to me
Drownin' in compliments, pool in the backyard that look like Metropolis
I think I'm sellin' a million first week, man I guess I'm a optimist
Born in Toronto but sometimes I feel like Atlanta adopted us
What the fuck is you talkin' 'bout? Saw this shit comin' like I had binoculars
Boy, Versace, Versace, we stay at the mansion when we in Miami
The pillows' Versace, the sheets are Versace, I just won a Grammy
I've been so quiet, I got the world like "What the fuck is he plannin'?"
Just make sure that you got a back up plan cause that shit might come in handy
Started a label, the album is comin' September, just wait on it
This year I'm eatin' your food and my table got so many plates on it
Hundred inch TV at my house, I sit back like "damn I look great on it"
I do not fuck with your new shit, my nigga, don't ask for my take on it
Speakin' in lingo, man this for my nigga that trap out the bando
This for my niggas that call up Fernando to move a piano
Fuck all your feelin's cause business is business, its strictly financial
I'm always the first one to get it, man that's how you lead by example
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Word to New York cause the Dyckman and Heights girls are callin' me "Papi"
I'm all on the low, take a famous girl out where there's no paparazzi
I'm tryna give Halle Berry a baby and no one can stop me

[Hook: Quavo]
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Versace, Versace, Medusa head on me like I'm 'Luminati
I know that you like it, Versace, my neck and my wrist is so sloppy
Versace, Versace, I love it, Versace the top of my Audi
My plug, he John Gotti, he give me the ducks, I know that they're mighty
Shoes and shirt Versace, your bitch want in on my pockets
She ask me why my drawers silk, I told that bitch "Versace"
Cheetah print on my sleeve, but I ain't ever been in the jungle
Try to take my sack, better run with it, nigga don't fumble

[Hook: Quavo]

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
You can do Truey, I do it Versace
You copped the Honda, I copped the Mazi
You smoke the mid, I smoke exotic
I set the trend, you niggas copy
Cookin' this dope like I work at Hibachi
Look at the watch, it blow hot like some Taki
Come in my room, my sheet Versace
When I go to sleep, I dream Versace
Medusa, Medusa, Medusa
These niggas they wishin' they knew you
They coppin' the Truey, remixin' the Louis
My blunts is fat as Rasputia
In a striped shirt like I’m Tony the Tiger
I’m beatin' the pot, call me Michael
Lot of you niggas that copy
Look at my closet Versace, Versace

[Hook: Quavo]

[Verse 4: Offset]
King of Versace, Medusa my wifey
My car is Versace, I got stripes on my Mazi
I'm dressin' so nicely they can't even copy
You'd think I'm Egyptian, this gold on my body
Money my mission, two bitches, they kissin'
My diamonds is pissin', my swag is exquisite
Young Offset no preacher but you niggas listen
Them blue and white diamonds, they look like the Pistons
Codeine sippin, Versace I’m grippin' them bands in my pocket
You know that I’m livin'
I’m draped up in gold, but no Pharaoh
Rockin' handcuffs, that’s Ferragamo
Bricks by the boat, overload
I think I’m the don, but no Rocco
This the life that I chose
Bought out the store, can’t go back no more
Versace my clothes while I’m sellin' them bows
Versace take over it took out my soul

[Hook: Quavo][Intro]
One time
Yo yo yoooo
MIGO!

[Hook: Quavo]
Smoke one, one time
Drink one, one time
Lemme fuck some one time
Tear the club up one time
Smoke some one time
Drink some one time
Lemme fuck some one time
Tear the club up one time
Only take one time (x8)

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Only take one time for me to put my eyes on you, I'm looking at you
Only take one time for me to just get high with you
Only take one time for me to just pull up
Only take one time for my nigga pull up with the choppas
And a hundred round drum
Call the Nawf one time and they come
What type of shit that you on
What type of drug that you on
YRN the label we put em on
Championship, you know that we winning one this year
I don't have to empty the clip, shoot one time, he outta here
Take your ho for the first time
And I only hit her one time
I walk in the jewelry store for the first time
I'm walking out looking like Busta Rhymes
I told my niggas we gonna see dollar signs, I told em one time
We overseas for the first time, but it sure ain't the last time

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Offset]
Migo gang say it one time
Now the choppa sounding like a drum line
Call up the plug one time
He pulling up with a hundred lines
One rum and one cosign
Have you in the drop top, no mind
Lemme smash one time, lemme pass one time
Lil mama staring at me, hit the gas one time
One time, one time, one time
I got more chains on than Busta Rhymes
Niggas cloning me but I am one of a kind
You say you be drinking but only one line
Only take one time for a nigga to snitch
Only take one time caught with a brick
Bumping yo lip you get shot in yo shit
All of this work I need me a forklift
Hit a nigga with a choppa only one time
And I got the pocket rocket and it's on me all the time
My diamonds hit one time and it make you blind
Technical foul fuck nigga crossed the line
Nigga one time, I stretch it to a nine
I got two hundred buried in the ground
One gun with bout 200 round
They looking for you in the lost and found

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Only take one time for me to call my niggas up and they pulling up
Thinking bout running up
I'mma chop you with the choppa then I hit the runner up
My mansion's got expensive furniture
My stingray Corvette, it come with the turbulence
Hit the gas one time, it's over with
I'm in Vegas in casinos and I'm betting my poker chips
Just like a spider, I web up the game
People they think it's Peter Parker here
One song Versace and it got us the fame
Niggas plotting, get one shot in your brain
Niggas biting but ain't gon say your name
Migo my family, only one gang
I came from the Northside and invaded the A
Start fucking up the city now we got our own lane
Now we blowing up like we on a mine
Givenchy khakis, Versace down my spine
Speeding in traffic I'm doing 200
That nigga say fuck the stop sign
Taking your bitch and I fuck her one time
But that bitch she be calling me more than one time
I drop a 8 one time, y'all drinking one line
You ain't never seen a hundred thousand dollar one time

[Hook][Produced by Southside, 808 mafia & DJ Spinz]

[Intro: Travi$ Scott]
I just got back from the hmm
I told her be back soon
I don’t really wanna go
(Migos!)

[Hook: Chris Brown]
I told her hold it down
She fucking with the plug, told her “come over now"
Where are all my bitches tonight?
Bring me some more bitches tonight
Yeah, I bought a hunnid rounds
She asking for fifty, threw a hunnid thou
Where are all my bitches tonight?
Bring me some more bitches tonight
Yeah, I’m feeling like Moses
I’m all in the ocean, I’m parting, divided up in it like Moses
She switching the motions and making them faces just like an emoji
Pineapple Fanta, it mixed with the Xanax, she loving the codeine
All of my killas, they ready to follow me, I feel like Moses

[Bridge 1: French Montana & (Chris Brown)]
Got a hunnid bitches with me, feel like (Moses)
Got a hunnid killas with me, feel like (I feel like Moses)
I got a yacht on the water, feel like
Got a hunnid bad bitches, feel like (Moses)

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Feeling like Kobe, sipping and drinking, I'm feeling like Kobe
Sipping and drinking, that yellow and purple, I'm mixing that codeine
Look at the top of my Audemar, look at them bitches, they wall to wall
Look at my niggas they all in, you know them niggas don't call a lot
Look at the Benz, look at them niggas, they looking depressed
Came with her friends, throwing them bags, that Mitchell & Ness
Young cold nigga, mouth full of gold teeth
Fuck nigga talking 'bout nigga? You don’t know me, huh

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Look at the presi', fuck with the Rollie and move like the president
This shit depressing, feeling like Moses, I'm giving them lessons
Skinny, tatted with the blue hair and the gold teeth
I don’t run from woop woop, shit fuck the police

[Hook]

[Bridge 2: Quavo & (Chris Brown)]
What you feel like (Moses)
What you feel like? (I feel like Moses)
What you feel like? Uhh, yeah (Moses)

[Verse 3: Quavo]
(Quavo!)
Feeling like Moses, pipe with the water, I cause a commotion
Lil' mama said she wet, she wetter than an ocean
I pull up on you, rub up on you like some lotion
You might call me Sniper way a nigga scoping

[Verse 4: Offset]
(Offset!)
When she get on her knees it’s for numbers
When it come to trapping I give you the formula
Cuban links hang on my neck like the ornament
Fuck on your bitch, I give her back, don’t want the bitch

[Verse 5: Takeoff]
(Takeoff!)
Grabbing it fast shit it’s magic
Two snow bunnies call ‘em Mary Kate & Ashley
Keep it on me, quick to shoot a three
Like Dirk Nowitzki from the Dallas Mavericks

[Verse 6: Quavo]
(Quavo!)
She said she wanna fuck with a real nigga
She said she wanna go to war and kill with him
50 bottles in the VIP, 50 models
Momma told me watch for the snakes and koalas

[Hook] + [Bridge 2][Intro: Takeoff]
If you know me know this ain't my feng shui
Certified everywhere, ain't gotta print my resume
Talking crazy, I pull up andale
R.I.P to Nate Dogg, I had to regulate

[Interlude]
Public Service Announcement
Where all my rich niggas at, man?
YRN shit, man
MIGO!

[Hook: Takeoff]
Broke niggas stand to the left
My rich niggas stand to the right
Lil' mama, she keep looking at me (lil' mama!)
I'ma knock the pussy out like fight night
Hit it with the left, hit with the right
I'ma knock the pussy out like fight night
Beat it with the left, beat it with the right
I'ma knock the pussy out like fight night

[Verse 1: Takeoff]
If you know me know this ain't my feng shui
Certified everywhere, ain't gotta print my resume
Talking crazy, I pull up andale
R.I.P to Nate Dogg, I had to regulate
Pocket rocket fire, watch him disintegrate
It's a truckload coming on the interstate
Sirloin steak all on my dinner plate
Your main bitch say she wanna make a sex tape
Rich nigga, I could never be a broke nigga (rich nigga)
Broke niggas I can never get along with them!
Always been hated since a little nigga (always)
It's forever pussy nigga gotta deal with it (rich nigga!)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Float like a butterly, sting like a bee
Rumble young nigga rumble!
Lil' mama want a nigga like me in the sheets
Ice Cube knock it out like Deebo
Now who's that talking that gangsta shit?
Somebody gonna kick your ass
When I walk up in the club I better make a thunderstorm
Let them know that this a whole lot of cash
Rich niggas on the right all night (rich nigga)
Broke niggas to the left by yourself (brokanese)
Now who the hell just said that the roof on fire?
Call 911 like Wyclef

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Offset]
I'm a rich nigga, I don't like a bitch nigga
Snitch nigga, broke nigga, I don't deal with you
All of my niggas, official, my bitches they strippers
My niggas they criminals trying to get to the M&Ms
If your bitch is so innocent, why she sucking my children
Last time I asked I dine and dashed and bitch I go in the building
Bad bitch make it clap, like Magnolia
Young rich nigga on the couch talking to Oprah
Bottles in the VIP while I stand on the sofa
I don't speak your language, Brokanese, I thought I told ya
These bitches they be smokin' on hookah, my nigga ballin' like Hoosiers
Geeked up in the Double R, I scare ya bitch, Freddy Krueger
Flooded Franck Muller

[Hook][Intro: DJ Durel]
It's been a long time coming
From young niggas to young rich niggas
It's DJ Durel and I'd like to welcome you to Rich Nigga Timeline

[Verse 1: Takeoff]
Young rich nigga riding round the city with the mac
Take a chopper, and a chicken, now watch the leakin'
Whipping and breaking it, making it, taking it
Nigga they mistake me, think I'm selling that midget, nah for real
What the fuck a nigga really wanna talk about?
You a bitch, we ain't got nothing to talk about
Shaking like a stripper, put that mac chicken up in his mouth
Skippa Da Flippa, he told me weigh it up and bust it down
Migo Jerz, whipping that lambo, now watch it swerve
Tray 1 got PT's, and sold that reserved
I'm a hot boy, so you know I gotta stay low
Quavo told me, trap on the block and bang 'em like OJ Mayo
You niggas are rookie but young Takeoff, I'm a vet
'Set told me trapping and dabbing gon' get that pussy wet
No Crocodile Dundee, Stingray vet
Whatever I wanna do, I do it, Nike check
I'm a young nigga with the rich nigga ambitions
At the Migo show, a nigga autographing titties
There's levels to this shit like Meek said
And you embarrassed to admit it, I don't want to kick it
After my show, the gangster-ist nigga, he looking suspicious
Walk right up on him, I'm pressing my nigga
And all he wanted was a picture
I used to smoke Swishers like a regular nigga
Now I'm a Backwoods type of nigga
A nigga, he ran up, tried to rob, I shot him
White people, they still treat me like I'm a victim
Now people they screaming out "Free Activis"
They talking bout that Activis be discontinued
Check my cup of muddy trouble, got packs in the attic
Catch me riding with packs in my rental
Trap, trap dab when I'm on the revenue
Cooking a brick and remix it with the dog food
Diamond brick come with a note on it, nigga you Blues Clues
24 karat my chain, Mr. T pity the fool
Master P, No Limit money, bando jumping like a bungee
Kevin Hart, your money is too short, you too funny
Call me Takeoff Hugh Hefner, I got playboy bunnies
Fuck it, I beat it, she sucking me 'til a nigga be cumming

[Hook: Quavo]
Cross the country, cross the country
You may never been there, catch me cross the country
Cross the country, cross the country
Coca leaves and palm trees, we cross the country
Cross the country, cross the country
She don't understand English but she want me
Cross the country, cross the country
I had to get a Visa cause I'm in and out the country

[Verse 2: Offset]
When you in the streets, you know you gotta make a name
I stole a Mustang, drop top, no brain
Police had a nigga, cause they know I'm in a gang
Taking pictures of a nigga like a groupie, like a fan
On my first lick, only got a little bit of change
Thinking like Obama, something gotta change
Did a lot of dirt, I had to sit up in the chains
When I got outta jail, did the same thing
I spent that money, money, coming back like boomerang
Cocaine in her nose like a septum ring
My niggas be trapping the gas, propane
Hit the nigga with a chopper, nigga bang bang
I was getting money, way before the rap game
As a young nigga, used to wear the fake chain
They say that I'm ignorant, $50,000 on a chain
You know it ain't come from Johnny Dang
Fake watch busta can't bust me, no lie
Won't catch me with the fake jewellery, I got too much pride
They killed my nigga Pistol P for a three-five
I pay the ticket, when are you gon' die
When I'm in the kitchen, I be cooking crack pies
I got chickens in the trunk, you think I work at Popeyes
The streets is the jungle, my nigga, you better survive
Getting married to the money nigga, that my bride
My diamonds gon' shine, might poke you in the eye
You selling by the ounce, my nigga, you just getting by
Put the birds in my hands, knows when's it gon' fly
Glah! Glah! Glah! In the bushes like a spy
Nigga talking stupid, we don't let that shit fly
Talking crazy to the Migos, boy you know we keep the fire
Got that chopper, flip a nigga like a domino
Young rich nigga, never made the honor roll
Hit his ass with the .44, make him fold
Chattahoochee River where that nigga body float
On the nation, my nigga we throwing up the forks
She on a mission, trying to fuck me, better get your ho
Big bank take little bank
Yellow diamonds on my rella like a moon cake
Two Glocks on my hip like Tomb Raider
Arnold Schwarzenegger turn into the Terminator

[Hook: Quavo]

[Verse 3: Quavo]
Cross the country, my plug he in Wyoming
And the only time I pull up on you, if a nigga owe me
And the whole word know that a young nigga rap
But a pussy nigga better not provoke me
Came in the game with the formula, sold it
Now I gotta switch it up on you phonies
Pocket full of macaroni, Mac-11, run up on you
All you can eat in my trap like it's Shoney's
Rich Nigga Timeline: that's my motherfucking testimony
Out in the desert, got bricks in the donkey
Rich nigga with a pot of gold like a leprechaun
And I'm thinking 'bout moving to Babylon
My niggas collecting extortion funds
We built an empire like Megatron
QC the label, Migo the gang
Already told you, I want the M&Ms, fuck the fame
No shame in the game, I'm a bull with the nine
Like Luol Deng, finna bang with the thing
Walking through the crowd, ain't gotta tuck the chain
Get juuged,  get capped, that's a part of the game, squad shit
Oh no, I done rolled around the block and I don't see him
I paid a J $200 just to hit me when he see him
If I was you right now, I wouldn't wanna be him
Caught him two weeks later in the club, with his mamacita
He had some jewelry on him, worth $100 so I took it from him
Took the first PJ across the country, got too hot for a moment
They say he got work, now I own it
Now my squad, they going up, no Makonnen
In the players pad at the Caesar's Palace
Out in Las Vegas, like I'm Roman
All types of Euros and Yen
I got money in Berlin
I told the Lord forgive me for my sins
Cause I don't wanna do it again

[Hook: Quavo][Hook: Quavo]
I don't know why I came in this club with you, girl
Don't know why I came in with these diamonds on my chain
Surrounded by bad bitches I can't get 'em out my face
Is it cause a nigga handsome and wealthy?
Is it cause a nigga cook like a professor?
I don't know how you feel can you tell me?
I won't know how you feel 'til you tell me
Is it cause a nigga handsome and wealthy?

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Is it cause I'm a star
It maybe could be my star status
I got my chain and ring
My Rolex watch it got 50 carats
It could be QC or even maybe it's me
It could be that 4 hour flight, shopping in Beverly
What's on your mind? I'm not Ginuwine
Ain't tryna spend no time
I know my bitch she so fine
But I don't know what's on her mind
Gotta pay that cost to be a boss
I put on my Louboutins playing golf
Young nigga walking with Nina Ross
I'm dropping the bombs like Viet Cong

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
They say I'm picky cause all my bitches exquisite
I'm in some vintage Givenchy smokin' a Philly
The dope that I sell is the purest
The junkies they hit it, they scratchin' and itchin'
The flow that we killin', the flow that we spittin'
My nigga you know we invented it
Dripping in St. Louis, I'm a lunatic
I'm a Migo but my bitch an immigrant
I got the boot but no Timberland
I am the plug, you the middle man
I never leave my niggas starvin'
You niggas mistake me for Marvin
I got 15 bricks I'm finna drop
In there right next to that carbine

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Offset]
Is it my looks or is it my wealth?
Or is it the way that I carry myself?
Let me know I need some help
Don't keep that secret to yourself
Bitches be saying I'm acting funny cause a young nigga got a lotta money
She lookin' at me like she want somethin'
Can't give her nothin' but a couple hundreds
She sucked up on a nigga, tryna give a nigga kisses, baby girl you trippin'
(I don't know how you feel can you tell me?)
I know why you came in this club tonight
Looking for a nigga that's gon' change your life

[Hook][Intro]
So what part of Atlanta y'all from?
From the north side
Uh, yeah
Every show get crazy and crazy
We growing and growing every, every, every time at a show

[Chorus: Quavo]
Disrupted the game, the industry was shook up
Three young rich niggas, never did a push up
You want the origin of the flow, you better shut the fuck up
And listen up, to what the Migos bout to cook up

[Verse 1: Quavo]
We killed the Versace, we went to Bahamas, shout out to the islands
Mommas and daughters taking a picture with me and they smiling
Charlemagne say the gang Donkey of the Day (Charlamagne?)
Billboard magazine, 45K
Word on the street they say the Migos wanted
But they can't find the Migos, so they bite their recorders
When you ask for a show, can you seriously afford it
Check my schedule, itinerary loaded of course
Check my dab, it's priceless
And my niggas is righteous
I don't got no type, but I love to fuck Pisces
The chains on my neck, I might get arthritis
YRN Tha Album first album going diamond
Got my mama a Benz
Just to show her I'm grinding
Green dots in the pen but I hate the confinement
When Offset got out of jail he ate a bowl of hundreds
Dropped the Rich Nigga Timeline and we was crossed the country

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Offset]
Skrrt, cook up
Graat, he shook up
I'm trapping the white, that Ku Klux
My niggas got grenades and bazookas
On the private jet we smoking up in indica
A hundred thousand, got a pick up in India
Headed to locker, we changed the millennium
Thirty thousand for a walk through minimum
Snakes in the grass start spinning out venom
That come with the territory when a nigga winning
Tinted windows on the sprinter you don't need to see this image
The blogs say I need to calm down, fuck a image
Your CEO a busta and my CEO a hustler
Choppa sound like percussion, run up on me repercussion
Came from nothing, came home with a half a million, hurt my stomach
I'm taking good care of my kids but they mamma get nothing
And if you think its wrong this ain't the right song you're bumping
Welcome to the jungle, lions, elephants and monkeys
Never see me lonely, best believe nina on me
Stuffed crust, my pocket walking with a 50 on me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Pyrex pot on the stove, take that eggbeater cook up
They looking for the origin, wanna know how did we make this shit up
Came in there right and we fucking it up
Jump off the banana boat, call me King Tut
Niggas be biting our swag I tried to switch it up
But these niggas still don't get enough
Niggas with attitude don't give a fuck
Young nigga flexing never did a push up
Migo flow everybody wanna look it up
Every ten years it's on my story bro
I bet you listen up, you don't gotta like it
Yo favorite rapper he be biting
When I step in the booth, its a moment of silence
I bet yo bitch she get excited
When I'm doing show my front end and that back end be enormous
I need a double cup with my Backwood when I'm on stage performing
Can't get in my tour bus bitch, ain't tryna fuck, it's only 5 in the morning
I got some Dominican bitches that sucking and fucking and back to the origin

[Chorus][Intro]
Ey Thug
Who the fuck this nigga over here?
Boy, you ‘bout to get fired on

[Hook - Quavo]
We don’t fuck around with that fuck shit

Fuck with 1017 you’ll get bust bitch

[Verse 1 - Quavo]

Chopper with that hundred round that’s a lay ‘em down
Don’t nobody move, don’t nobody make a sound
All my niggas play with Whitney, that’s that Bobby Brown

[Verse 2 - Young Thug]
I rob in my black tee, hit licks in my black tee
I’m not Gucci, 4-5 long as Shaq’s feet
I'm sippin’ on that mud, I’m not a pig, I’m a squid
Oscar flows in the spot, pull ‘em open, bust your wig

[Verse 3 - Quavo]
All my niggas keep that sid like Billy the Kid
No drag queen, but we aiming at your wig
All my niggas keep that saw like that movie Saw
Double pump, pistol grip, that’s that sawed off

[Verse 4 - Young Thug]
Take ‘em off for his bails, but we not soft
We get them choppers shipped in straight from Moscow
These diamonds brighter than the light, I’m a fucking moth
Teach a lil’ nigga how to juug, I’m his fuckin’ scout

[Verse 5 - Quavo]
WWE, yeah, you know my team is raw
If the boss say don’t fuck with you then get lost
If the plug front me bricks then I get it off
Fifty choppers in that Maybach like I’m Ross

[Hook]

[Verse 6 - Takeoff]
I’m posted at BP, serving that gas like QT
Foreign bad bitch she a cutie, call the plug up for a QT
All blue Lambo tookie, Steven Spielberg, I make movies
Me and Thugga Thug just boolin
Strapped with choppers and Uzi's
Got an Asian plug with the sushi, smokin' diesel, call it dully
Don’t front me no set, I’m taking off with it, call me Darren McFadden
You know I wear Prada, you niggas wear nada
I can get you knocked off, that’s a done dada
Tomorrow the Louis, I’m tired of the Truey
But niggas can’t do it so I gotta do it (do it, do it)

[Hook][Hook: Takeoff]
I'm the next 2Pac and Biggie
Scaled dope for 2Pac, pockets on Biggie
Pop a molly have you shaking like that nigga Diddy
Your pockets fat but now they slim, call it Missy

[Verse 1: Takeoff]
I got that Bobby Brown but I ran out of Whitney
Still got some Brittney, got a lot of Lindsey
Citgo on 48, come get this Julius Erving
Smoking Larry Kush and we call it Eddie Murphy
And I keep my circle tight, like a virgin
Black and grey old Cutlass, George Gervin
Fuck your mama make you made, call me Melvin
Drugged up I'm bout to overdose, call me Elvis
The world is mine I feel like Scarface
I'm fucking hoes I feel like Babyface
I know some migos put a scar on your face
That bitch bad she got a baby face
Her ass fat but she got a baby waist
That's my lil' boo thang, I call her Babycakes
Bout to go to the jeweler, call up TV Johnny
Want Takeoff to do a show? Gon' cost some TV money

[Hook x3: Takeoff]
I know junkies in the street selling DVDs
Mp3's, I know niggas who sell M-16s
Got a plug thats talking them bricks, dealing with Yao Ming
Got a plug on that gas, and that lean

[Verse 2: Quavo]
I know junkies that will kill, for a bump
I know niggas that finesse pigeons out the trunk
Lil' goons on the block like a 9 to 5
I know J's that cut your grass just for a dime
I know hoes that sell they soul for bankroll
Same bitch in high school, she act like I don't know her
Birds flyin' in, just for the summer season
Coca so good, had the junkies nose bleeding
Junky clean my rims, rake my leaves, wash my car
Cause he know I got that pack take him off to Mars
I ask lil' mama have she ever rolling off them bars
She suck me up then call my phone askin' for them bars
Feds calling up my phone saying that I'm selling squares
Selling birds, selling pigeons, flying to Brazil
Feds calling up my phone saying that I'm selling squares
Selling birds, selling pigeons, flyin' to Brazil

[Hook x3]

[Verse 3: Offset]
Plug across the water, I'm taking a vacation
Plug helping me eat, Army salvation
Your bitch with me (What time it is?)...penetration
And I fucked her so good she hyperventilating
International J's some be Haitian some be Asian
Quarterback vision, you can call me Peyton
J's at the Texaco working like they slaving
Working with the  soda, its already baking
Fiends crave it, fiends itching like its poison ivy
Moving all these drugs, CVS should gon' and hire me
Shake and bake on a plug, call it Ricky Bobby
Sylvester Stallone on my wrist cause it rocky
Some fiends like the mollies, some fiend like the icies
Some fiend like the xans, white like Klu Klux Klan

So that they already know

[Verse 27: Retro Jace(Two9)
Drop 'em aside like Compton
Potato on the tip like condoms
Calculator clip, they don't want no problem
4-5 Just like a pill, might pop 'em
Uh, Goon's that'll shoot you for a hoodie
Copped a camera man, just to get the footage
Whole crew gon' mob, and I don't mean Goodie
Hit him in the head, and he gon' need goodies

[Outro: Flex Knox]
Oooooh!
Yes, yes!
You just experienced
Wrath of the Titans
Monsters unite
And it went down
Heavy, heavy, heavy
Ruuuuuuuow[Hook]
I came from mug shots
To posters on the block
Keep our song on replay
Now all we need is 3 Mics and a DJ
3 Mics and a DJ x3

[Verse 1: Takeoff]
Know 3 young niggas on the North
By name of Quavo, Offset and Takeoff
We mobbing pull up at your house
Squad open the trunk and I pull out that sawed off
Cutomuto he gone cut your throat, Migos dressed in the cut knock your jaw off
I came from bitches staring at me
Now when they see me they taking their top off
Brazilians, Snow Bunnies, and I like Dominicans
Gold on my Giuseppe Steppers, red on the bottom on my Christian Louboutins
I used to be jugging, finessing, remixing the plug on the island like Gillegan
I gave em a flow, and they stealing it
The block on fire, I can extinguish it

[Hook]


[verse 2: Quavo]
3 mics 3 mics 3 mics nigga that changed my life
Mama she told me get right
No more standing over the stove at night
Now I rock the stage and I get paid, it's 50k in my resume
Remember hitting licks in the Honda
Now I'm riding round president tints on a escalate
Picking hard ball like the Braves
Rocking out shows on the gravey
I told my mama we made it, Harriet Tubman chains no slavery
Breaking the sweat like the 80's
Play with the water like Navy
My niggas really in the field
3 mics we don't need a fucking deal

[Hook]

[verse 3: Offset]
Back in the day a flamingo DJ Ray G playing Bando
That was the number one single
Bitches wanna come and mingle
Zonatti Guiseppe wrapped round my socks
We came along way from mug shots
Ducking and dodging the cops Ray G to me Offset stop
Offset never listen had to do a sentence when i got out we took to the top
They say when you worth a milli thats a different feeling
Wanna know benji im the definition
3 mics and a DJ shot fired on the freeway
Cooking the dope will get bagged like a replay
Running circles around you squares no relay

[Hook]

Got goons with me that'll hit your ass up, nigga I ain't talking bout no homo
Call up mercy for the mojo,yall niggas ain't getting no dough

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ballout]
I got that 9 on me, run up you die homie

Migos! Go!

[Hook: Quavo]
Got hundreds of peons, they comin' in, on Tonka trucks
Fuck nigga, he don't believe me, he could go add it up
Add it up (x12)
The bricks just came in, the molly came in
The white just came in, you don't believe it, fuck nigga, add it up
Add it up (x9)

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Add it up like a new calculator
In the trap with two guns like I'm Tomb Raider
Hop on the track with no pen or paper
We blowin' up, I got that detonator
You could add up the dope like accountants
Put that dope in the water, don't drown it
Add it up right now, bet it motherfuckin' lookin'
Like a nigga livin' up on a mountain
I dreamed I woke up in Phantoms, naked bitches in a mansion
I did my calculations, most of you rappers is imitatin'
They back on the island, I'm contemplatin'
Should I shoot to kill in my situation?
Mama said "Quavo, better stay patient!"
The dirt that I done you add up the cases

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Offset]
Beep! Fff!
That's that money machine and it's addin' up!
The trap is a bakery, whippin' and cookin'
The dope, I send it straight to Canada!
Young Offset trappin' in your area
Jungle fever, got the white and I marry her
I see Justin Bieber, the ghost is way scarier
Hit a juug, fifty bags of the good cannabis
All these other conversations irrelevant
If you ain't talkin' bout Benjamin Frank
Gold fingers like a trophy and painting
Got the 45., turn you to a sharp painting
My pockets is healthy, Zanotti Giuseppe
My money is stretching, my money athletic
Tyler Perry, makin' movies, they epic
I'm not the one from Cuba, that's my necklace

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
We fucked the world up when we dropped that "Versace"
It topped the chart, nigga, so add it up
"Versace", it got us a M and 'em
Don't believe me, fuck nigga, then count it up
Stealing my flow, we come to your show
Put you on camera and we embarrass ya
Fuck your management, and your manager
You is a amateur, choppa'll damage ya
Trappin' and cappin', had to make it happen
Trapper turned rapper, my mama happy
On the block trappin', don't serve undercovers
Snakes in that grass, they gon' get you on trouble
If I get jammed, put that on my mama
That I won't tell on my brother
In the bando and I'm countin' the fuck out the p's
Got rich off a pot and some water

[Hook][Verse 1: Quavo]
These bitches see a young nigga
Cause I'm walkin' round with these hundreds
And I pull up in that Lambo
So fast you ain't even see me coming
I got chickens out in the country
Got a AK finna start drumming
You was talking shit behind my back
But now here a nigga you ain't sayin' nothin'
Young rich nigga live forever, my trap game A1 clever
You say that I'm broke how dare ya'
I ain't never goin' broke never ever
Your arms and your legs I sever
Then feed em to the sharks for dinner
Quavo too hot like a kettle
Young nigga and I keep the heavy metal

[Hook: Quavo]
Adios, adios, adios
You ain't talkin' cash nigga adios
Adios, adios, adios
You ain't talkin' to the plug nigga adios

Adios, adios, adios
You ain't talkin' gwala nigga adios

[Verse 2: Take Off]
Yeen talkin' bout cash adios
I pull up in drop top convertible Rolls
My chain is all gold, the Fendi to Gucci to Louie
I see it I buy what I want
Young rich nigga I take a toast
Finessin' Pablo, he gotta go
Up on the boat, finessin' Pablo out his O's
Meetin' up with Carlito
I'm takin' them trips cross the globe
The dope that I smoke get you high, UFO
I'm sellin you ain't gettin' it back, no repo
It's finito, bitch adios
You standin' and lookin' like you seen a ghost
Maybe it's cuz I'm in this Phantom Ghost
I'm trippin' I just finessed you out the do'
Finessin' the plug, it's adios

[Hook: Quavo][Hook: Quavo]
This rap shit changed a nigga life
I'm fucking three hoes in one night
This rap shit changed a nigga life
I asked her do she wanna fuck, she said
"Aight, aight, aight, aight, aight"
This rap shit changed a nigga life
M&Ms, M&Ms counting up hundos, aight

[Verse 1: Quavo]
I'm livin' my life, aight
Don't worry bout me, aight
Got M&Ms on me rubber bands on my Benjamins tight
You took my chain it's aight
I bet he didn't get it without a fight
Called  the squad and they looking for him, one night
He outta sight
Northside where I came from
Put the buss down rollie Obama on
YRN the label, we on the wire
Commit to the team and I buy you a charm
Secret service Migo uniform blowing up like a nuclear bomb
Got so much gas in the V.I.P. take a trip out to Humboldt to check out my farm
Imma keep it real shout out to the niggas who shot at me
Now I'm strapped up in the field
Migo Gang look like a army
Nat nat now we call 'em bees cause them bitches be swarming
Doing shows overseas take a flight every night then land in the morning

[Hook: Quavo]

[Verse 2: Offset]
Plug said he got  twenty bricks for me
I'm bout to pull up, aight
I'm bout to catch me a flight in bout 24 hours I be in Dubai
Your bitch and another bitch dyking
I pulled to my mansion they got so excited
Stuffed crust the Backwood and light it
Pacquiao Mayweather my diamonds fighting
When I pull up on yo bitch I might just hop in the Viper
It's three of the Migos we pass the ho in a cycle
Mama told me that you always gotta go read the Bible
Sippin on a 20 oz, I got 4 zips in the bottom
Rap shit changed me, hating the fact that a nigga is famous
When they take pictures, don't know that I'm dangerous
I done had a chopper, shot it in anger[Hook: Quavo]
Most of these bitches ain't mine
Most of these bitches ain't mine
Stop claimin' me bitch, you know you lyin'
Most of these bitches ain't mine
Most of these bitches ain't mine
Most of these bitches ain't mine
You can have that little bitty bitch, you know she ain't mine
Most of these bitches ain't mine

[Verse 1: Takeoff]
Most of these bitches they ain't mine, nigga
You can have that bitch, I swear she ain't no dime, nigga
She no quarter, I won't spoil her
Think she Moses when she cross the water
Immigrant, she cross the border
How the fuck niggas say they can afford my bitches?
It's the same niggas rockin' Jordans
Pull up Trailblazer, like I'm in Portland
White boy shoot better than Kyle Korver
300 Spartans, my niggas immortal
Sellin' fishes, I got Nemo and Dory
In the swamp with gators like I'm in Florida
Tryna get rich like Richard Porter
Takin' that Pyrex pot and glass bowl
And stickin' my hand in that water
If the bitch try to take a quarter
It gon' be a homicide, Law and Order
It's cheaper to leave her
But it's gon' cost you some money if you wanna spoil her
She got that Aquafina, call her water
She wanna ride on top of my Sequoia

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Offset]
You cuffin' your ho and I'm fuckin' your ho
Like a light, she can switch
Sloppy toppy, eat it, licorice
Wipe the gloss off your lip when you suck the dick
Why you claimin' a nigga? You know you ain't mine
It's time to cut her off, it's 'bout that time
Why the fuck you keep lyin'? You a little fine
I'm not wastin' my time, only spend with dimes
She got the audacity say that we're married
Chasin' a nigga like Tom & Jerry
Look how she standin', she Halle Berry
I laugh at the bitch like I'm Tyler Perry
Your birthday, be singin' like Mary Mary
She say she a virgin, don't got a cherry
I'm not fuckin' no bitch if the pussy hairy
I'm passin' your bitch like a Hail Mary
She wanna claim me cause I'm famous
Mexico groupie bitches, they be dangerous
Immigrant bitches, they don't speak our language
I don't fight over bitches, I leave your shirt painted
Innocent bitches, they look like a model
Shaped like a bottle, they suck and they swallow
Lil' mama, she bad so niggas gon' holla
And shouts out lil' mama, she only fuck ballers

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Quavo]
You can have, she ain't mine
No, I don't want her
I don't want her
Yes she's foreign, I caught her in Barcelona
Got this Spanish lil' mama, like to drink Corona
But you can have her, she gon' instantly bend it over
Cuffin' bitches, I ain't worried 'bout it
Cause everybody know about it
I pulled up to my mansion in the Audi
Smashed and then she outtie
Say she from New York, I had to call my nigga Rowdy
He told me that she goin' in, she got that sloppy toppy
So you know what I did?
I got her suckin' me up in a Benz
She told me she wanted a threesome
I told that lil' bitch call her friend
When I pull, light the light, the Forgis slide
You must be blind if this money you think ain't mine

[Hook][Prehook – Takeoff]
Baby keep on calling my phone
Wanna know when I’ma come home
She telling me that I be fucking bitches
And I told her that she trippin'
Cause you must be high off shrooms
Want to investigate me when I come in the room
Talking bout where you been at
And why you ain’t pick up your phone?
I’ve been on the road stacking money
Talking bout I treat her like Macaulay Culkin
Cause she stay at home alone
But it’s all good though

[Hook – Takeoff]
When I come in with them M&Ms
And tell you to count up this big bankroll
Everything good though
Told me stop trapping but you told me
That you wanna get up out the hood though
All my hard work, it done paid off
Shawty stayed down since day one
Got to keep her by my side like my Tommy gun
Put on my jewelry baby, shine like the sun

[Verse 1 – Takeoff]
Ok I be on a private jet to Porteguese to just pick up some Benjamin Franklins
From some people I ain’t never seen
The OGs keep telling me boy you gon make history
Told my bitch you better ask about a nigga in these streets
We can go to MIA to see the palm trees
Lamborghini, man we pull up on Daytona Beach
When I look into her eyes I make her panties leak
She still probably won’t believe so we taking a trip to go to Belize
But it’s all good though

[Hook]

[Verse 2 – Quavo]
Quavo talk to em' ooh
You know you’re shining baby
Looking like some VVS diamonds baby
Want to thank your mama, my god what a creation
Wanna welcome you into my mansion with an invitation
I’m a young nigga, ain’t used to relations
So you know I ain’t patient
She told me she black and she Asian
Look how she walk when she came in
She hate it when I got to go on the road
But she like it when I bring back the hundos
She cooking spaghetti and gumbo
Mama told me don’t eat no sauce from no hoes
But you know a nigga really like you
But you tryna shut down my empire
That’s my lifestyle, like the wire
You too bipolar, baby you fire

[Prehook + Hook]

[Verse 3 – Offset]
I had to fly out to Vegas to show her that I’m a player
I’m not used to cuffing the women but I’m gonna save her
Booty fatter than Deelishis, when I hit her we lay up
We together, get up on our knees and we say our prayers
Ain’t no trials and tribulations, we having some patience
25 she got two cars, and a house that she pays for
So what else could I ask for, first night I was mad, I didn't smash
And that taught me a lesson, lil mama got to be special
She just want to kick it with me, we can travel wherever
She know I got a busy schedule, sometimes she be acting selfish
When I hit her she be quitting cause she say it’s too much pleasure
She telling me her favorite song is Handsome and Wealthy
She love it when I’m kissing on her body, start to melt her
I be murdering the pussy, I should have another felon
We sticking together just like we salt and pepper
But it's all good though

[Prehook + Hook][Intro]
Whoa, I'm in love with that ho bro

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
She crazy as fuck but she sexy as fuck
And she just hit me up, she text me "let's fuck"
I'm just waking up but fuck it I'm up
Ooh! I'm on my way (where?)
Get out my way bump-bump-bump-bump
I'm Norman Bates and this bitch ain't normal, our kids gon be nuts

She knew what not to say
And when they would leave, she gave me heads up
Lord I feel like Plies, that's my lil' baby
But that bitch so crazy
That bitch gon kill me, and then she'll be famous, that'll be crazy
Amazing Amy, amazing Amy, my bitch so crazy

Waiting for Migos and Wayne to fall off

[Verse 3: Offset]
Choppa like Tony watch how I do my opponent
Wait on my moment I beat it I own it
Keep that thang on me you won't catch me lonely
She wanna suck and fuck and put it on me
She plotting on me trynna get some money
Had to cut her cause the millions coming
Run off with the work, started trappin dummies
Caucasian, Black and Asian you amazing
We poppin' them seals we not in the Navy
We won't take a deal cause we got the paper
That people hate it, we still nominated
Young Rich Niggas yeah we graduated

Smoking up the gas bag you can smell the fragrance
Got me buying handbags, man this bitch is crazy

[Verse 4: Takeoff]
Amazing Amy
Amy wanna have my baby
(Nah) she been patiently waiting
Waitin' for me to get famous
Want me to buy her Mercedes
I thumb through the check then I looked at her crazy
I'm focused on the M&M's
You want Benjamin Franklins you gotta have patience
I pull up in the coupe and its disabled
I'm drinking on maple these bitches watching me on cable
Nigga's trynna copy but they can't be the creator
I'm a legend, feel like Will Smith, can you be my Jada?
And I'm in the Oakland Audi looking like a Raider
When the Migos in your city we pack out your stadium
In the kitchen with the Dominican's I'm creating em'

Young rich nigga trappin' out Bentleys, rich nigga trappin' out Bentleys

Antidope, antidope, antidope, antidope

[Verse 1 : Quavo]
Yo, Quavo
I got the antidope try to come juuggin' and I'm bustin' your cantaloupe
I'm trappin' out of the bando, still got tools like Rambo
I'm feelin' like Harry Houdini
The pack was just here did you see it
The plug he be here any second now
If he didn't then something went down
We losing our bags, gotta go to the stash
At the age of 19, I was running from the task
Put it on my mama, no flex, no brag
Young nigga been had cash
Just me and Rel Money got rich off a half a bag
That's why they mad

[Hook]

[Verse 2 : Takeoff]
I got the antidope

Fuckin' around with Eduardo, told me that he know Armando
Armando fuckin' with Carlos, Carlos wrappin' em up in the barcodes
Ridin' around with that Scotty in brand new Bugattis
OG Miley Cyrus, snakes tryna give me the virus
But I got that antidope like I know science but I'm no scientist
Fuckin' around with them bombs but I am no terrorist
Piss on your bitch that R Kelly shit

[Hook]

[Verse 3 : Offset]
Austin Powers, you niggas be takin' my Mojo
Young nigga I got the antidope

Whippin' and cookin' and flippin' chickens
You say you got money but pussy nigga you dont have a witness
Cause I've never seen it
I'm a rich nigga I mean it
Keep talkin' bullets go through yo' beanie

Young nigga plugged in like adapters
Stomp yo' ass out like an Alpha
Ahead of you niggas you still in the first chapter

[Hook]Intro:
Seen you last night
At the club, for the first time
In about a year, damn, girl I
The look on your face
Didn't say that
Things were going the way
That you planned
When I saw you for the last time (x2)

Hook:
Know sometimes you wish that you was with me (Ah)
If we had a baby, what it would be (Ah)
Is your bank account, empty (Ah)
You can call me babe, anytime

[Verse 1: Sean Garrett]
Ain't gone lie (Ain't gone lie)
You ran up I ain't expect to see you
You start talking (talking)
Saying shit ain't straight with him
You bring it up (saying)
You miss the way it used to be
Ain't gone lie, but I moved on so far from here
You asking me (honestly)
I ain't got no answer
Is it true?
That I'm blamed for that
I ain't got no answer
If I told you
All my set backs
All the shit I went through
I just buried my momma
Two months after I caught you
Hey, You heard I got that check
Hey, and I ain't trying to look back
I hope that maybe you chose
To take a damn good care
I ain't wish you no better
But that ain't none of my business, no

Hook (x2)

[Verse 2: Quavo]
I know that you wish that you had a young nigga like me
I know that you sad
I know you praying the Lord for a nigga like me
You missing the shopping sprees
You missing the diamonds all in your rings
I pull up in Jags and Rovers and Bentleys
I know that you miss the front seat
Your bitches, they asking about me
Wanna know what a young nigga do
Cause the see my girl in that red dress
And they say that could be you, in it
Everytime they see Quavo, they say that boy pursue
(Like a real) Just look at yourself in the mirror
I know you wish I was there
That Porshe, Panamera, you know that car was your favorite
My momma she told me you crazy
I know you hate that I made it
So many chains, look like slavery
I hope I make you go crazy
Throw a hundred dollars for your step-baby
You can have that old ass Mercedes

Hook (x2)

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
God damn, back then
Your momma, she wasn't fucking with me
Taking a trip out the city, go quick on that Brittney
She thicker than Jiffy
The Louis, the Gucci, the Prada, the Fendi
Versace, and Givenchy
Know lil' mamma gone miss me
I was the Santa on Christmas
She talking about having my baby
But told me stop whipping them babies
I told her you crazy
When you see me pulling up in that drop top
I made it
She calling my phone, she come in my home
Knock on that booty, I'm gone
Met a bitch, said her name Nia Long
Smoking that good, ching chong
Came a long way, neighborhood star
And I'm on the top of Worldstar
Back then , nigga, looking at a star
Now a nigga shine with the stars
Red bottom got blood on the floor
Metta World Peace, got that elbow
She won't stop calling my phone
She hear me everyday on the radio

Hook (x2)[Verse 1 – Ray J]
See it in your eyes when you’re looking at me
Goddamn, Imma burn a hole through the middle of your Givenchy
You ain’t ready for this beast I be
[?] with a little Cognac, a little something in my swisher sweet

[Bridge – Ray J]
I don’t understand why I feel this way
Got me feeling like I'm in outer space
Swear I always been the type in the club that'll hold shit down
Caught up in the matrix, so far gone, don’t wake me now

[Hook - Dria]
Don’t keep me waiting, I’m anticipating
Come meet me baby, in this dream
You and me
I be the [?], come home when you need me
Got my arms wide open, I mean my legs wide open with me
Got my legs open like an ATM
Got my legs open like an ATM
Hundreds in a bank roll, got me open 24
XO got me kinda throwed, kinda throwed, kinda throwed

[Verse 2 - Quavo]
Beat it up, beat it up, beat it up
Like Michael Jackson, bout to beat it up
Got her legs open like an ATM, so I told her cash out on this spatula
You the baddest bitch in the club, right?
So I hit her with a left like fight night
In the club tight, diamonds shine on bright
Looking like I work at [?]
I’m the king, baby call me Elvis
Can a nigga see below your pelvis?
I didn’t come alone, I came with the felons
She want to take it to the next level, I’m a trend setter
Baby living better, she want to see if I got real cheddar
My pockets so fat, look like nutty professor
The blue Benji’s make her feel better

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Ray J]
Damn she wetter than a tsunami
Sweating like a motherfucker, hotter than a goddamn [?]
She’s a rider like a Ducati
If you want to come and get it, spit it
I'll eat it like an edamame

[Bridge]

[Verse 4 – Takeoff]
Takeoff a young rich nigga
Christian Louboutin sweater
Gold toed, these are Maison Margielas
Pockets sloppy, [?] change the weather
Slippery whip out, I'm Cinderella
I can make it rain in any weather
I look like Frank Lucas in the chinchillas
Pull up in the Bentley, you niggas weak
I'm a veteran, you just a beginner

[Verse 5 – Offset]
Offset!
She wet like Pacific, her head is terrific
Lil mama, she gifted
She suck on the dick, baby girl do not kiss it
Eat it up, eat it up, like I am jiffy
Intelligent independent, she been fucking with me from the very beginning
Church girl, when she with me she sinning
I’m granting her wish, she calling me a genie
Got my finger on her panty line
Lil mama bad, you should see her mom
She looking sexy when she chew on gum
Come with Offset, baby have some fun
3 2 1, lil mama she the bomb!
In her Birkin bag, she keep my gun
Bitch is sucking and she number one
She Brazilian, not American (Foreign!)

[Hook][Hook: Quavo]
Mansion for the bachelors
Flippin' all these hoes like a spatula
Nah, you know I don't like no camera (nah!)
Your bitch she like an animal attackin' us
She won't leave me 'lone, she love the bachelor
Migos, young rich nigga, we some bachelors
Bachelors, bachelor, bachelors, ooh bachelor
Bachelors, bachelors, uh, bachelors, Migos some bachelors

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Quavo, I am a bachelor
Look at the way I'm dabbin' like a pastor (I'm dabbin' ain't it)
I am a bachelor
Rockin' the shows, smashin' hoes right after
You know I'm a bachelor
Got your bitches workin', calling me master
Came from the bottom and now I got guala
Turn the page, my nigga, we on the next chapter
Trapper turned rapper
Graduated, now a nigga's a bachelor
Flippin' your ho like a spatula
Don't get me wrong, I still whip up with spatulas
Your ho was creeping like tarantulas
Migos we don't like the cameras
We find out that we can make millions with it
So we started flexin' like bachelors
Came from stashing money in the ceilin'
Young niggas why don't you wanna be bachelors?
Came from kicking doors, juugin' plug for the bows
And now we taking trips to Africa, Africa
Niggas say that they are entrepreneurs
I don't see the millions that you pursuin'
Statistics in black and white, what is you doin'?
Top the charts every time we drop a new one

[Hook: Quavo]

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Migos, we the bachelors, we pull up in tarantulas
Whippin' the dope, with the Terminator break the spatula
Get the pack and then I wrap it up and then I bag it up
If I catch a mug I'll charge a private jet to Canada
Promoters ain't got my money, I'm shootin' up your manager
Fuck it my nigga, we shootin' innocent bystanders
My niggas on top of the mountain, no Grand Canyon
Pull up with choppas and make a nigga call the ambulance
Drinkin' on Actavis and I'm rollin' up cannabis
Hoes runnin' 'round the lobby geekin' up and their panties wet
I had a cuban link and Rolex before the rap shit
I just adapt to the trap cause that's my habitat
I'm in the corner catchin' the work like a cornerback
Runnin' to the money, my nigga, think I'm a running back
Niggas still trappin' quarters, make 'em give their quarter back
Forty pointers in my Breitling, oh that's what you lookin' at?

[Hook: Quavo]

[Verse 3: Offset]
Pull up to the mansion, 50 story, hundred rooms
She lookin' at my diamond solution, that ain't no shrooms
Hold a nigga rest and beat his head in with a broom
Got the bird that be flyin' like caterpillars out cocoons
Penthouse elevator, it'll elevate yah
Pull up in the Bentley, think you seen a fuckin' Jeeper Creeper
Got that 9 on my waist like a two-way beeper
Got that price on your head, nigga like a alopecia
I'm a bachelor, I got a oil factory in Africa
Trapper turned rapper then rapper turned into a massacre
Then beat a nigga, stomp a nigga, I will not account
From the beginning these bitches, they wasn't shit, they ate the apple
I had a warrant with the sack, the police tried to make a tackle
Green Bay with the green, vacuum seal it, I'm a Packer
Just because you rap about it, you are not a trapper
Just because you got a milli, you are not a bachelor

[Hook: Quavo][Hook: Takeoff]
Half a bag, whole bag, half a bag, whole bag
Half a bag, whole bag with the price tag
Half a bag, whole bag, half a bag, whole bag
Half a bag, whole bag with the price tag
Half a bag, whole bag, half a bag, whole bag
Half a bag, whole bag with the price tag
Half a bag, whole bag, half a bag, whole bag
Half a bag, whole bag with the price tag

[Verse 1: Takeoff]
What you want a whole bag or a half a bag?
I need cash, I need cheese, nigga I need all my racks
Running from the task, silver block with them tags
I got stinky kush pack it smell like a trash can
Whip it on the stove then I cool it with the fan
And my left hand told me its in love with pots and pans
Addicted to the whole bag can't even serve a gram
And I'm doing it for my niggas who be locked up in the slam
Price tags in the bag, in the glass baths
Get my work from overseas, my work from Trinidad
Got bombs of the gas like I'm in Afghanistan
And I'm posted on an island, you can call me Gilligan
In the bando wrapping packs in Saran
Some of the bricks be white, some of them bricks be tan
Posted on the block with a whole fucking bag
12 pull up, everybody ran

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Quarterbag, half a bag, I need the whole thing
I know niggas knock you out, call it Sugar Shane
Red and white, pull up in the Lamb, candy cane
Got damn, racks too heavy I need a cane
Two styrofoams filled up, I'm drinking on Wayne
Foreign bad bitch in my crew, she came from Spain
On the phone catching play while I'm getting brain
Yeah he say he want that white, then the drama came
Make the work disappear, call it David Blaine
Walk around nina on my hip, John Wayne
Pull up in the dump, Lebron James
10 chains on my neck, but I'm not a slave
Batman coupe, pull up in the Batcave
Old money on me so they call me OJs
Run away with the set like OJ
Shawty rolling off a b she need some OJ

[Hook]

Got the bag on my back like a soldier
Gucci bag and its a roller
And it filled up with the doja
Walk past you can smell a loud odor
Got lean in my cup no Foldgers
And I pulled up in a Rover
And I hit hoes like Sammie, no Sosa
No coke - aina, no teaser, take trips, no visa
I make a hurricane, no FEMA
.36 hold it up like a nina
And I pulled up in the beamer
Count Franklins like Aretha
And I got dough, Little Caesars
The block so hot, catch a fever
Already know I got bags filled to the top, no hash
Got beans, got lean, got gas
Niggas better come with that cash
Gucci bag came with the flag
Hell nah I can't front you no bag
Hell yeah I just fucked my team
[?]

Little nigga smokin' mid, give that pack back to your uncle (mids!)
Got a bad bitch, yeah, she asian like Kitana (she bad!)
Got a scope on the sniper rifle, I see the anaconda (I see 'em!)
Talk to Scooter in Dekalb ,  Quavo, he said "you a road runner"
Free my nigga Offset, ASAP, so a young nigga can get back to the money

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Egg beater my left, Pyrex pot my right
Baking soda on the shelf, beat that pot like Winky Wright
Ever since my daddy left, Mama taught me "son do right"
50 niggas to my left, 50 niggas to my right
50 chickens come a day, 50 chickens come a night
When I whip my work today, They gone find yo ass tonight
All my niggas on go, you know they gone smash on sight
That shit you rap and talk 'bout, nigga, you know thats my life

Trap, trapping out the house with the boards on the windows

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Trapped out the bando, got tools like Rambo
Got bird like Birdman, got white like Lindsay Lohan
Made a hundred stacks off the pots and pans
On the corner serving grams, my niggas be on the block hard
My niggas be selling that hard, got bricks, like Shaq, at the free throw
You can call my phone, got them prices for the L-O, don't knock at my door, I don't wanna talk to you
Got them bricks for the low, I will serve you
In the bando, boarded up, got them bricks in the wall and in the floor
Pizzeria way I'm playin' with the dough
If the feds wanna talk, I just tell them I don't know
Fuck twelve!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Offset]
Trapping in the vacant, serving all my patients
Get it from the Haitians, smoking loud my eye look Asian
Getting to the money, running to it, tryna chase it
Like it when she make it, cook it when she naked
Throw it in the microwave, Betty Crocker how I bake it
Trapping in the bando, big guns like commando
Flip it like a sandal, foreign bitch she look like J.Lo
Get a brick from Venezuelo, meet the plug his name is Pedro

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Trapping out the house with the boards on the windows
All new Camaro with the black and red interior

Certified packs nigga you can check the serial
Foreign bad bitch and she say her name Trina
Traphouse look like it got hit by hurricane Katrina
These pounds bought a beamer, everything I do illegal
The bitches always wanna mingle, I'm stacking my money like pringles
Sipping on sprite and codeine, my foreign bitch Philippine
Her girlfriend Chinese, sipping on lean and popping a bean
Diamonds come from Africa, sipping on lean and smoking loud
Feel like I'm on salvia, flipping the work with no spatula[Produced by Jahlil Beats]

She ain't never fuck with a rich nigga
She told me that her ex was a bitch nigga
So I told her put me on the 'Gram though
Just to flex on that nigga with some real killers
And now he on my line talkin' reckless
I'm thinkin', should I slide or should I check him?
But I ain't goin' to war bout no pussy though
But if you tryna you get wet then
Runnin' with my niggas on the low-low
We in the south side, talkin' mafioso

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Takeoff, I make the work disappear like a magician
Take that envy then stand in the kitchen, whip me up a chicken
I beat that pot like a chemist, money bat-bat like it's tennis
And free my niggas in penitentiaries, they locked in the system
I pray the Lord is my witness, nigga, I'm stackin' them benjis
Ever since they killed Pistol Pete my nigga, I turned to a menace
And all these diamonds around my neck, I put on two of them chinchillas
Drop my top in the winter, cash out at the Beverly Center
Go to my jeweler out in Cuba, get diamonds below temperature
Double cup my muddy trouble, I'm an Actavis citizen
Bitches run around the lobby, boot 'em up, but no Timberlands
Your bitch pull up to my trap with no car
Like football she get penalties

[Hook]Hook

I don't know what car to drive today (Awman!)

Whip in the Jaguar, hop in the lear

Or should I smoke gas and sip medicine
They vote on me like I'm the president
I'm counting on Bedloo to pick out my mamacita for my photoshoot
I'm overdue I'm rocking Versace with chains so how can they notice you
Kicking it old school 20 chains on Mr.T fool
How many hundos, should I bring out the bando hit Bedloo

[Hook]

[Verse 2:Takeoff]
