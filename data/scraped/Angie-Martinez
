[Dice shaking]
Uhh [dice thrown] yeah
Uhh, here's another one, and another one
Yeah
Lil' Kim, the Queen Bee

[Verse One: Angie Martinez, Lil' Kim]
It's ladies night, what!
It must be Angie on the mic
The Butter P honey got the sugar, got the spice
Roll the L's tight, keep the rhymes right
Yo, I just made this motherfucker up last night
And uhh... I'm the rookie on this all-star team
Me and Kim is gettin' cream, like Thelma and Louise, but on chrome
Never leave that Brooklyn shit alone
So if you say it's on, then it's on

Bang this in your whips
Pack em call the roadie with the chips in the wrists
Here's a french kiss *kissing sound*
I dismissed all you chicks
Split six from the four-fifth
Make you dance, ooowwww
I stay focused, in the dopest
Like a penny with a hole in it, y'all just hopeless
And toke this, I ain't lyin'
Niggas trying to knock me off, keep tryin'
All it takes is one phone call to my street team
Promote that ass, like a soundtrack New Jack Ci-tay
Set It Off with the eighty-fitay
Y'all missin the buck, with the fuck
Bump Biggie in the trunk and the buck to my thorough bitches
Lemme see ya do the Bankhead if ya richest
It's the rap Mae West to Q-B
And I got all my sisters with me

[Hook]
Oh this is ladies night, and our rhymes is tight
Oh this is ladies night, oh what a night (oh what a night)
Oh this is ladies night, and the feel is right
Oh this is ladies night, oh what a night (oh what a night)

[Verse Two: Left Eye]
Uhh, never the one, packin' a gun
Got some other raw chicks for that, lay your ass flat
I be the one chockin' ya paragraphs, with laughs
Getcha back up on the right path
Ain't no stoppin me ladies from club hoppin' gets my rock on
From flavors still frozen at Paradise joint
Booty shakin with the glass in my left one
Right hand sayin step-son
To me my girls is fancy fly bitches
To my niggas straight snitches, to them other chicos
Lady pimp ain't havin that shit
If you ain't got the cash to stash, suck my dick hoes
Strictly a bell ringer
Lay another finger on this big bad wolf miss lady rap singer
I be the one to blame as the flames keep risin
To the top and it don't stop

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Da Brat]
Y'all see, how these bogus niggas
Try not to notice the dopest bitches
Approachin with good intentions
But focusin' on they riches
If it's, too hot then get the fuck up out the kitchen
Niggas dicks, stay lifted when they thinkin of me
Cause the rhythm I kick, puzzle them like arithe-ma-tic
Fillin em with, sluggers off the nine milli luger click
Bitches bust, we just, keep kickin up dust
And you can spread rumors shit is makin me sicker than head tumors
Humor me, by huggin me sayin you lovin me
Playa phony niggas be buggin, I can tell
Cause the thug in me wanna sell drugs and push keys
Need to get me mo' of deez, VV's and M3's
Smoke weed from overseas pimped out styled Rol-eys
Fuck the police keep my wallet obese
Who the Windy City woman still still comin' and gunnin' straight from the Chi
Tonight's the night for all the ladies, let's get high!

[Hook]

[Verse Four: Missy]
Ayo Kim, heh heh, yaknowhatI'msayin?

Check it out, uh huh, yeah

Oh what a night
You should be like Missy 'stead of bein like Mike
I like to ride ponies instead of ridin' bikes
Me and Lil' Kim got the rhymes to incite

[Lil' Mo] Yeaaaaaaaaaaayyyy!!!
[Angie M] Uh, woo! come on, uh
[Lil' Mo] If I can go, with you
[Angie M] Yo, yo, uh

[Verse 1: Angie Martinez]
If I can chose a place to go it gotta be far away
From here we could crossover like Hardaway
Somewhere outside the states, where tommorow's like today
And I'm out in a space where nobody else can stay
And, if I can go, with you
Then I'll go get the ticket right now if that's cool
Have you ever been close to feelin like leavin the coast too
Feelin like leavin with somebody who
Hold you the right way while watchin the night fade
Make you feel like you right back in the ninth grade
When you know what he likes and what he might say
And you try to be calm and answer in nice ways
And, if I can go, with you
Way out the states no 2-ways and no page
No cells and no trace, and you just a phone call away
So all I got to say is

[Hook: Lil' Mo]
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly away, like there is no, no tomorrow
If can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
I'll get my things, soon as you say, baby vamos, we'll fly away

[Verse 2: Sacario]
And, if I can go, with you
Oh boy we 'bout to make a lot of people annoyed
In Croix, you better know I know how to sneak with them toys
Employed, with the block since around 94 boy
And, if I can flow, with you
Holdin dat dough after the studio I roll with you
I send Dutch and three other goons to go get you
Sacario the name awaits the whole issue
Grown men keep on cryin get mo' tissue
The way me and this girl be rhymin it's so official
Them I'm takin a trip too with no pistols
Cause everything peace only sand no streets
Little Miami Heat, that's the plan we'll see
Two cups, one in Senado one in Sand Beach
And, I'll think I'll go, with you
So tell the station you need a week - back to you

[Hook: Lil' Mo]
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly away, like there is no, no tomorrow
If I can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
I'll get my things, soon as you say, baby vamos, we'll fly away

[Bridge: Lil' Mo]
You can fly away, no one has to know
Babe take me with you, cause if I can go
Soon as you say the word, we'll be on our way
To a foreign place, you got to tell me

[Angie Martinez]
Yo, uh, so now that we got a plan are you comin? We could plan a week
The only question now is LaGuardia or Kennedy?

[Sacario]
And a seat, know why? the window cause I like to see
And seein as to how I'm so fly me and the clouds can speak

[Angie+S] And, since we 'bout to go, in a few
[Sacario] Go 'head

[Angie Martinez]
Oh, I just wanted to tell Trace thank you
That week off I'm grateful what was you tryin to say boo?

[Sacario] Nuttin just grab my chain off the table and 2 way too

[Angie Martinez]
Ok, that little place it's a great move
But ain't no problems, unless the water don't stay blue

[Sacario] And the shop's there?

[Angie Martinez]
If they don't got em, they don't make em (Sacario: True!)
No concrete just sand, throw away your shoes
Now, that we are on, our way
And our bags is packed and the car service is not late
Everything's ok, so I guess I catch you on the next track
Now I don't gotta ask

[Hook: Lil' Mo]
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly away, like there is no, no tomorrow
If I can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
I'll get my things, soon as you say, baby vamos, we'll fly away

[Outro: Lil' Mo]
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly way, like there is no, no tomorrow
And if I can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
Nothing at all, I'll tell my friends, nothing at allWhoo!

CHORUS: Angie and Lil' Mo
Even though you got no money
Other chicks be actin funny

I'm so tired of all these playaz
And I don't mean to be a hater
But I know just what I'm lookin for
[a nice guy that like to fuck alot]

[Verse 1]
This is for my on the low niggas
Average joe niggas
You know, I'm tallkin plain ol' niggas
Big up, big up all the regular dudes
Appreciate 'em after dealin wit a playa or two
What I'm sayin to you, is all the ice is nice
But a girl get tired of payin the price
See it ain't what we eat, it's how we do
I like Mr. Chal, but we can do BBQ
Fuckin wit you, you gon get to my heart
We can chill, crack jokes, smoke a L in the park
And when it come to lovin, you go hard...
Yeah, now that's really what a girl want
And uh, nobody can do me
Like you, so you the one that I'm givin it to
For rich or tore up, I'm in it wit you
For you fake smooth niggas, I'm finished wit you
Beat it

CHORUS

[Verse 2]
Yo, yo, uh
I shine, you shine
Gotta alotta big things playa that's nice
I don't wanna knock your hustle but I know your kind
And I don't trust ya so I'm lookin for mine
Not tryin to sell me the gathos, not poppin bottles
Not tryin to stick it to models
You know misled bitches, after your riches
Try to throw me in the mix don't even notice a difference
I don't like Coogie sweaters anyway
I like a nigga in a hoodie better anyday
I'm not a chick-en, I'm not to be tricked on
Matter fact you the rea-son

You don't really gotta be my boyfriend

While I, move, my thang, c'mon

[Hook]

[Angie Martinez]
Yo.. I, come through - doin what I do

Hey! life is good
Yea, uh, uh, uh, yo

[Angie Martinez]
What's that sound?
If you outside the club, and your joint c'mon
You just pop the truck
Pull the car up and the line is packed, and you far
You tired a' waiting, you  better be catch a charge like
"Move bitch, get out the way", flash the bouncer to get out a payin'
And that sound make you wanna get on stage
Oh, you gotta' "move dem thangs"
Beat change, it's a Cool & Dre thing
That'll move your thang thang, remove your ring change the sound
Get your jewels all sweated up, the booze is deaded up
Anything goes bring it back, if you just catchin' up
The sound coming outta' the club - that's wassup!
And they let you up, finally, dancing it up
Movin' aroung, DJ Keith - I need that sound (da-mn)

[Hook: Angie and Missy]
That new shit, that hot shit
Make you move shit - what's that sound?

Make you can kick down - who's that chick?

Screamin' Angie - what's that sound?
[Missy] And this Missy gettin' tipsy off the wiskey

[Missy Elliott]
2002 be sceered, cause I'm runnin' this shit this year
Haters 'n haters you better be clear
Or you'll be kissin' my pussy on the rear
What I'm talking 'bout, with my filthy mouth, from the Dirty South
Is a drug-drop, c'mon check me out
Ain't nobody does it easy-seezy
And ain't nobody got the dick to sling me (owwww!)
God damn, what's that sound?
Didn't I tell you I'm about to shake it down
I'm no punk, but a killa like Cam
Get on the flo', yes yes mam
When I show up the club get cram
Insecure bitch watch yo man!
Me and Ang like butter on toast
I don't mean to boast, but we do
[Angie] I need that - yea

[Hook]

[Angie Martinez]
Hello-oh? oh that's my ears ringing
I'm sitting here thinking that sound is still bangin'
As we leavin' the spot I'm still drinking
Gotta' leave cause the cops are still waiting
So we circle the block, as we workin' to blot
Then purposely watch - we so blingin'
And the truck is bright, light up the night
Blinking, as we stuck in the chair feel like we sinking
That sound still drowned the air waves
The echo in my head feel like a bear cave
So I sit back to the sound of this track
Playin' on my way home - I can't forget that
That beat when you hear from the street
Make you wanna get on the floor and don't even speak
Cause it don't even matter who be around
Get.. and that's DJ Keith - playin' that sound (I need that)

[Hook] - 2X[unknown singer]
Ohhhhh.. senorita.. when the evening sun go down

Introducing, Jadakiss and Styles P, where you at?

[The L.O.X.]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
You know we still in the hood dog, in front of the store
With the work across the street and the gun in the stall
Soon as somethin happen niggas wanna run to the law
You know the code of the streets, never run to the law
That's why I can't even run 'less I run with a four
Or I walk with a three, come and talk to 'em P
You can catch me down bottom with a bird and a Glock
On the block makin money where they murder a lot
Or you can catch me up top shootin dice for a yard
I'm talkin six digits, niggas bet the house or the car
You can catch me hittin the spliff, sick in the pit
On the fiend like I'm missin my shit, they think I'm crazy
Catch me hittin your lady in my Mercedes
Bird on your baby, fuck you I'm keepin it gravy
L.O.X. hold the hammers
Like we waitin for screws
With Angie Mar' BLOWIN MOTHERFUCKERS OUT OF THEY SHOES, WHAT?

[Angie Martinez]
Comin live from the streets where some died tryin to eat
From Y.O. to Philly, from Harlem to Q.B
And when it drops, game over, you'll see
Introducin, Beanie Sigel, tell me how you livin?

[Beanie Sigel]
Aiyyo, I've been kickin murder - since Adidas with thick strings
T.I. sweatsuits, Pumas with thick chains
Four finger rings, black belts with brass names
I was spittin flames since niggas was pitchin change
I'm a hard knock kiddo, always played the middle
Threw flacks in the crack game, getchu if I can getchu
Since a buck, played the highway, dodgin the troop boys
Jumpin in and out of Coupes, wavin for Duke boys
Always chased a penny, copped quarter waters
Tried to make a dollar chased my pop's boss daughters
Tryin to make my name, global, in all four corners
Philly baller, gamin in all four quarters
Never worked, never will - all my hoes buy my clothes
I can't go broke, never will - all my bros buy my O's
I'm the best thing that linked up with New York since Sprewell
I murder, nuttin further - fill in the details

[Brett]
I'm here, it's over, fuck how y'all feel
When I drop, y'all gon' realize it's all real
Bein left for dead, tied up, smoke 'til I was dried up
So high up, seem like the sky ducked, high what?
Life was rough, but now it's nothin to hide
Used to click and be quick to put this gun to yo' side
Be like, "That chain nice - I like that pal
Matter fact {*click click*} I'd like that now."
You've got game?  Call the name, just spell the name right
Brett, one of the best rappers ever to touch a mic
It's prophecized I'd write, spit scriptures mind blowin
'til my coffin top close and heaven skies open
Fear no man's my slogan, I hope y'all believe
I'm just like you, fear nuttin human that bleeds
My mind breed two movies, six ab-lums, a hundred poems
Thirty R&B joints, I'm beyond the norm, y'all just mad
I'm just glad, got my time to shine
Y'all the type to hit three hundred bars and run out of rhymes

[Angie Martinez]
Brett, from my ByStorm family, with Angie
Come live from the streets, from Harlem to Q.B
And when it drops, game over, you'll see
Introducin, finally, the legendary Kool G

[Kool G. Rap]
It's B.G.S. kid so what you facin?  Caps racin
Decapitation twenty buck-fifties and lacerations
Guerilla fam' camouflaged out in the grass waitin
To blass your nation slash like Jason and bash your face in
We ass lacin top bodies and half in the basement
Our style, cast you so bad you'll need plastic replacement
When gats is raised in, fascination blastin and blazin
Evacuation for your whole staff there's gas in the tank and
Gets back abrasions from cap grazin, defy gravitation
Pull my shit back squeeze bust it like masturbation
Hold fort, hold the blow torch, leave your soul scorched
With no remorse, the state of New York, get your shit caught
When niggas hawk, let the fifth talk
So tell me who's the next man to flip?
I stop the beef shit, with rubber handled grips
Your candle get lit, guerilla shit feed us banana clips
The hammers hit, anything in our range we dismantle it

[Angie Martinez]
Like to say thanks to my street correspondents, for gettin on this

Comin widdit like the Punisher
Gettin all up in your stomach uhh.. huh, my bad
Gettin focused now
Lot of niggas in the club wanna poke us now
But, back it up baby nice and slow
Cause I roll with a whole lot of G.I. Joe's
In the cut camoflauged with they eyes on me
While I, move, my thang, c'mon

[Hook]

[Angie Martinez]
Yo.. I, come through - doin what I do
Niggas buggin out like, "Who the fuck knew?"
Same chick from the radio dial
Same one from the summer jam, gettin 'em wild
But now my niggas it's a new day
BK always like Biggie doin "Jui-cy"
Iced out like David Blaine
What's it all about baby IT'S, MY, THANG

[A] Yeah, I know how to move it.. (yeah, it's my thang)
[Q] I know how to do it.. (yeah, it's my thang)
[A] I know how to move it man.. (yeah, it's my thang)
[Q] And I know how to do it (yeah, it's my thang)

[Hook]

[A] Yeah, I know how to move it..
[Q] I know how to do it..
[A] I know how to move it man..[Big Pun]
Yo yo Angie, come downstairs, the pump is open
Hurry up ma!  Put your socks, put your slippers on!
C'mon ma hurry!  (Alright then, I got it)

[The Product G&B]
Oooohhh Angie..
Ooo-whoaaaa, yeahhh..
Oooh yeah hooooo whoahhhh, ohhh-ye ohhhhh-yeah

[Angie Martinez]
Uh, yeah (ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Uh (ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Uh-uh-uh uh-ah uh-ah-uh-ah
I started in Brooklyn, comin up in the game
Everybody has a story mine wasn't the same
Angela, delinquent, I thought I was grown
I went through a lot things way before I was known
See my moms, she never knew I would make it all start
She was through with the bad grades, the late nights in the park
Causin my mom pain, my life was in the dirt
I played hooky all day while she was hard at work
Sorry ma, know it was hard and my pops was a jerk
She packed her shit and got us out of there before it got worse
Moved the fam to Miami in hopes of changin my ways
A big portion of my mind still remained in a daze
It wasn't 'til we came back my life matured
Success would be the only thing that I was fightin for
I was determined to get there, and keep it hot
Since that day my only goal was to reach the top

[Hook: The Product G&B]
To every little girl, on every block
That's comin of age tryin to reach the top
I said no matter who you are, you can reach the stars
But never forget, how fragile you are, cause a girl is fragile

[Angela Martinez]
It's crazy, when I think back, sometimes I have to cry
Cause when you young, you don't see how life can pass you by
You don't even really care if you gon' starve or not
This go back to ninety-three when I got the job at Hot
I used to answer the phones for Flex, do overnight spurts
Back then, I was like, "Hey who knows?  It might work"
I wasn't satisfied, but it would just begin
Cause in ninety-five, I was every day, six to ten
I put in a lot of work so I could bring in my listeners
I secured a fanbase, although some of them dissed us
I was new at my thang, but I was doin my thang
And I would never let nobody try to ruin my thang
But of course, there were people couldn't stand where I was
Cause although know I'm in, I wasn't made what I was
Through the heat, kept it movin, throw the haters a smile
What would they do if they knew her heart was fragile?

[Hook]

[The Product G&B]
Angela.. (uh-huh) Angela.. (hahahah)
Angela.. (wooh!) Angela.. (uhh, uhh)

[Angie Martinez]
Overall, it's a rough business, it could stop even you
There's people that's gonna say things that's not even true
Like the one about me not bein down for my women
And I hated the lesbian rumors that went around for a minute
How bout the one that goes, 'Yeah, she goes with him
He bought her the car, the ice, the clothes and rims.'
And I'm sure you all heard she caught one dead in the face
It'd been different if she said what she said to my face
As for men, who knows where my story will start
I went through a relationship that nearly tore me apart
So I'm chillin for now, it's all about me for the moment
Cause there's things that I wouldn't allow
But I'mma be aight though, keep comin with tight flow
Try to stay on the low while I'm watchin your hype grow
Playin the role like nobody can cramp your style
But I know, like you know, that you're fragile

[Hook]

{*The Product G&B ad lib to the end*}[Redman]
Alright everybody move back from the ropes
If you don't move back we're gonna turn this music off
And that's my word, move back!
Word is bond let's get this shit goin
Word up, it's the Funk Doc in the house
Say hell yeah!          HELL YEAH!
Say fuck yeah!          FUCK YEAH!
Word up, it's the Funk Doc Spock you don't stop
It's my man KRS you don't stop
It's the girl Angie you don't stop
With the hah haha ha haha hah!!

[Angie Martinez]
It's the Butter Pecan Rican speakin deletin
Other radio jocks that think they competin
They pre-sweetened, like candy, I'm hot like pepper
Big up to Sandy but my name is Angie
Martinez, what a true microphone fiend is
Steppin up lovely with MY, AD-IDAS
Through your speakers, representin
Boriquas, and all hip-hop rhyme seekers
You may think I'm crazy right, but I'm crazy hype
Slay this nice y'all, everytime Angie grab the mic
I jams it right tonight, not the hardest
But peep the style of this Puerto Rican Goddess

[Redman]
Aiyyo yo yo yo, stop the music!
Aiyyo back up off the ropes, man, word up!
Yo get from the off the ropes
Now aiyyo yo yo, KRS-One, come again the selector!

[KRS-One]
It's been a long time but we made it, you waited
You gettin frustrated cause these MC's in trainin
Skills on the mic for a royalty save it
Pullin down rap so that others can't make it
They can't fake it in front of KRS they naked
That same old MC trend I'm here to break it
The highly conceptional multidirectional
Hot in ninety-seven so I guess I'm flexible
Rap relieve stress so yes I guess it's medical
All your wrecking and raping is still theoretical
Redman, you know you must understand (Whatup?)
Redman, you know you gots to understand (Hah! Whatup love?)
Angie, rockin with the one BDP (Ha, haha)
Representin right now at Hit Factory

[Redman]
One two hah, and you don't quit
It's Kris and Angie with the ultimate
One two hah, and you don't quack
It's Funk Doc smoke weed and don't smoke crack
Hahaha, hah, and you don't quit
Hoohahhahah, and you don't quit
I rock jams like, Samsonites with mics
Stage two boomin system and flood the lights
The lyrical, fo'-fo's lettin off like suppose
Reggie Reg is rockin on the ra-dioooo!
Hahh, huh, the oooh-child too chill
Caps peeled, Someone In My Bed like Dru Hill
Raise em up, cause I feel my spot can't be touched
No time for the Pauline jack, hit the clutch
Shotgun what?? It's the high exalted
Ruler of the buddha, the cash make my pockets
Stick out like a tumor, for the consumers
I get busy with La Pluma, detonate the bomb
To make you hibernate sooner, certified luna-tic
My click run deeper than Charlie Tuna
Kahunas, raw for the able key movers
All over the hood like them Crooked I coolers
Bang maneuvers, from Jerz to Vancouver
Back to the Bronx with heartbeats ample looped up
I Blastmast like Kris, funk abyss
Like a phone chauvenist with a Roley on the wrist
Sike!  I can afford it, less I slaughtered
Three platinum niggas and none of em prerecorded
KRS-One need to be runnin for office
So Butter Pecan Rican -- tell them to get off his[Lil' Mo] Yeaaaaaaaaaaayyyyy!!!
[Angie M] Oh yeah yeah
[Lil' Mo] Yeaaaaaaaaaaayyyy!!!
[Angie M] Uh, woo! come on, uh
[Lil' Mo] If I can go, with you
[Angie M] Yo, yo, uh

[Verse 1: Angie Martinez]
If I can chose a place to go it gotta be far away
From here we could crossover like Hardaway
Somewhere outside the states, where tommorow's like today
And I'm out in a space where nobody else can stay
And, if I can go, with you
Then I'll go get the ticket right now if that's cool
Have you ever been close to feelin like leavin the coast too
Feelin like leavin with somebody who
Hold you the right way while watchin the night fade
Make you feel like you right back in the ninth grade
When you know what he likes and what he might say
And you try to be calm and answer in nice ways
And, if I can go, with you
Way out the states no 2-ways and no page
No cells and no trace, and you just a phone call away
So all I got to say is

[Hook: Lil' Mo]
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly away, like there is no, no tomorrow
If can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
I'll get my things, soon as you say, baby vamos, we'll fly away

[Verse 2: Sacario]
And, if I can go, with you
Oh boy we 'bout to make a lot of people annoyed
In Croix, you better know I know how to sneak with them toys
Employed, with the block since around 94 boy
And, if I can flow, with you
Holdin dat dough after the studio I roll with you
I send Dutch and three other goons to go get you
Sacario the name awaits the whole issue
Grown men keep on cryin get mo' tissue
The way me and this girl be rhymin it's so official
Them I'm takin a trip too with no pistols
Cause everything peace only sand no streets
Little Miami Heat, that's the plan we'll see
Two cups, one in Senado one in Sand Beach
And, I'll think I'll go, with you
So tell the station you need a week - back to you

[Hook: Lil' Mo]
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly away, like there is no, no tomorrow
If I can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
I'll get my things, soon as you say, baby vamos, we'll fly away

[Bridge: Lil' Mo]
You can fly away, no one has to know
Babe take me with you, cause if I can go
Soon as you say the word, we'll be on our way
To a foreign place, you got to tell me

[Angie Martinez]
Yo, uh, so now that we got a plan are you comin? We could plan a week
The only question now is LaGuardia or Kennedy?

[Sacario]
And a seat, know why? the window cause I like to see
And seein as to how I'm so fly me and the clouds can speak

[Angie+S] And, since we 'bout to go, in a few
[Sacario] Go 'head

[Angie Martinez]
Oh, I just wanted to tell Trace thank you
That week off I'm grateful what was you tryin to say boo?

[Sacario] Nuttin just grab my chain off the table and 2 way too

[Angie Martinez]
Ok, that little place it's a great move
But ain't no problems, unless the water don't stay blue

[Sacario] And the shop's there?

[Angie Martinez]
If they don't got em, they don't make em (Sacario: True!)
No concrete just sand, throw away your shoes
Now, that we are on, our way
And our bags is packed and the car service is not late
Everything's ok, so I guess I catch you on the next track
Now I don't gotta ask

[Hook: Lil' Mo]
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly away, like there is no, no tomorrow
If I can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
I'll get my things, soon as you say, baby vamos, we'll fly away

[Outro: Lil' Mo]
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly way, like there is no, no tomorrow
And if I can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
Nothing at all, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all(pa-ra-ra-ra)..

Uhh {dice thrown} yeah
Uhh, here's another one, and another one
Yeah
Lil' Kim, the Queen Bee

[Verse One: Angie Martinez]
It's ladies night what, it must be Angie on the mic
The Butter P honey got the sugar got the spice
Roll the L's tight, keep the rhymes right
Yo I just made this motherfucker up last night
And uhh... I'm the rookie on this all-star team
Me and Kim is gettin cream, like Thelma and Louise
But on chrome, never leave that Brooklyn shit alone
So if you say it's on then it's on

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
Bang this in your whips
Pack em call the roadie with the chips in the wrists
Here's a french kiss *kissing sound*
I dismissed all you chicks split six from the four-fifth
Make you dance, ooowwww
I stay focused, in the dopest
Like a penny with a hole in it, y'all just hopeless
And toke this, I ain't lye-in
Niggas tryin to knock me off, keep tryin
All it takes is one phone call to my street team
Promote that ass, like a soundtrack New Jack Ci-tay
Set It Off with the eighty-fitay
Y'all missin the buck, with the fuck
Bump Biggie in the trunk and the buck to my thorough bitches
Lemme see ya do tha bankhead if ya richest
It's the rap Mae West to Q-B
And I got all my sisters with me

[Chorus:]
Oh this is ladies night, and our rhymes is tight
Oh this is ladies night, oh what a night (oh what a night)
Oh this is ladies night, and the feel is right
Oh this is ladies night, oh what a night (oh what a night)

[Verse Three: Left Eye]
Uhh, never the one, packin a gun
Got some other raw chicks for that, lay your ass flat
I be the one chockin ya paragraphs, with laughs
Getcha back up on the right path
Ain't no stoppin me ladies from club hoppin gets my rock on
From flavors still frozen at Paradise joint
Booty shakin with the glass in my left one
Right hand sayin "Step, son"
To me my girls is fancy fly bitches
Too my niggas straight snitches, to them other chicos
Lady pimp ain't havin that shit
If you ain't got the cash to stash, suck my dick hoes
Strictly a bell ringer
Lay another finger on this big bad one miss lady rap singer
I be the one to blame as the flames keep risin
To the top and it don't stop

[Chorus]

[Verse Four: Da Brat]
Y'all see, how these bogus niggas try not to notice the dopest bitches
Approachin with good intentions but focusin on they riches
If it's, too hot then get the fuck up out the kitchen
Niggas dicks, stay lifted when they thinkin of me
Cause the rhythm I kick, puzzle them like arithe-ma-tic
Fillin em with, sluggers off the nine milli luger click
Bitches bust, we just, keep kickin up dust
And you can spread rumors shit is makin me sicker than head tumors
Humor me, by huggin me sayin you lovin me
Playa phony niggas be buggin, I can tell
Cause the thug in me wanna sell drugs and push keys
Need to get me mo' of deez, VV's and M3's
Smoke weed from overseas pimped out styled Rol-eys
Fuck the police keep my wallet obese
Who the, Windy City woman still still comin and gunnin
Straight from the Chi
Tonight's the night for all the ladies, let's get high!

[Chorus]

[Verse Five: Missy Elliot]
(Aiyyo Kim, heheh, yaknowhatI'msayin ?
I ain't even gon' leave without sayin sun'un on this track
You ain't gonna use me to just be singin hooks
What I look like?
Patti LaBelle or somebody nigga? Heheh
Check it out, uh huh, yeah)
Oh what a night
You should be like Missy 'stead of bein like Mike
I like to ride pony's instead of ridin bikes
Me and Lil' Kim got the rhymes to incite
I gotta catch a flight
Aheheh, round three and shit
Niggas can't see us from Elektra to Undeas
Aaaaoooowwww niggas wanna be us
Heh I'm out he, ooh

[Outro]
*ladies night, ladies night...*[Hook: Jay-Z (Angie Martinez)]
How you say my love in spanish? (Mi amor)
(How you say my love in thug) Can I hit it raw?
In the backseat of my jeep, or maybe on the floor
(Easy papi) Nah mami, teach me more
(Tr'teme especial means treat me special)
I ain't got no time for that now, dame un beso
(Wanna keep a good girl like I told you before)
(Easy papi) Yeah, teach me more

[Verse One: Jay-Z]
I like fast cars, I love faster chicks
You don't need a small waist, I take ass and tits
Love chicks that deep throat, love bein left alone
On a Sunday afternoon with the remote
Love havin my cake plus eatin it too
Shit, I got cake what the fuck I'm 'posed to do
Like chicks to dress, but I love a good shoe
Sophisticated mama with love for the hood too
Love sexin girls on that boricua shit
Love black girls that's when the Levi's fit
Chicks that play hard to get on that Aaliyah shit
If at first I don't succeed, then believe I split
Can you blame me? Young buck, dirty-ass pops trained me
Moms allowed it, daddy was about it (Bout it)
Game got inherited
Mama said if you find love you better cherish it
Teach me!

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Angie Martinez]
I like to slow dance, I like to romance
I like to.. stroll through the park holdin hands
Ask me how my day was, tell me "Ma lookin pretty"
On Sundays in the cut watchin "Sex and the City"
Havin long talks and good lovin in the mornin
Walk them dogs when my body is callin
Flesh air force cuts a wound with a line
No stress of course, cause I don't have the time
Like to wine and dine but please hold your liquor, cuz
I'm rollin with ya and I hate a silly nigga
Like 'em rough and rugged, love it when you tug it
You buggin out of line on that thug shit is nothin
Dealt with cats before that I had to train
Dealt with cats that's poor and a cat with fame
One who played basketball and I had more game
So por favor, papi stay in your lane

[Hook][Dice shaking]
Uhh [dice thrown] yeah
Uhh, here's another one, and another one
Yeah
Lil' Kim, the Queen Bee

Yo, uh
The animals are here
It's a new day...yo yo uh

It's about being close to the ground
Like dope fiends and not even fallin'
Some people frontin' now they keep callin'
But that's life, ain't no grudge in my heart
I could sleep mornings, that's the business
I just keep that shit apart, that's the wisdom

In my position get hard, I deal wit people from far
Very few I keep close, that's how you keep from the scars
You gotta move like a ghost, cause some people are stars
And all of a sudden.. they forgot who they are

But look at me I'm still Angie, back wit a plan B
It's a new day you could sit down or stand me
I just try to be an example, bringin' the animal out
When everybody doubting underhand me
Its ample time, If you could not see the big picture
Cause there's plenty ladies like me I'm a big sista
Always on the grind through whatever you say
And just incase you ain't clear its okay
It's a new day!

[Chours1: 2x]
If you need it to be, (uh) Then it can be (yea)
It happen for me, It's a new day (a new day)

[Chours2: 2x]
Keep hoping, Keep focus
Approaching, up, A new day

Reaction to my first verse in a year it was clearly unexpected
Me on a record, We must yea agree it was hectic
Getting here half sleep and eating breakfast in my chair
How I feel, it's a new day now, that's for real
I was prepared to deal wit, whatever was given
People dissecting what I'm spitting on, not giving me a chance
Listen and understand, they ain't know how to react
Off my 16 bars on that track, "She out or she back Damn"
Then came a record ("If I could go")
I'm not saying my shits perfected
But if I could go's the beginning accept it, connected
You already know, yes is an automatic question
Automatically answered cause I'm flowing like you never heard
Why second one it can't be said in words
Except it had to be done, in other words I'm leaving on top
You mad at me huh, believe it won't stop
The love it's much stronger you can not break my hunger

[Hook1: 2x]
[Hook2: 2x]

See they love for you to give up, can't wait for you to slip up
As soon as you hit rock bottom, they never picking you up
Or never picking you out, they always out when you pick
But when your outfits is sick, or you got a hit
Then every other word is, "No Doubt
When can we go out, When can we grab lunch," I only get mad once
Cause when you get mad twice you sacrifice then a punch
And then a situation jumps so I grab a blunt
Roll it and spark it cause you media targets
Pictures is blatant ya know what I'm saying
This ain't ancient this is today shit
But it's a new day shit no games get played shit
No time get wasted, I learn from the worst situations ("yep")
And I made it, everything I had in my heart I pushed and gave it
So when I say it's a new day I mean it
Cause when it's the truth you must agree shit!

[Hook1: 2x]
[Hook2: 2x]
Ya hear me singing

[Hook1: 2x]
[Hook2: 2x]
We on our way
Animal house
Macneezy[Angie]
Welcome to "Animal House"
The animals are in the building
It's a new day

[Verse: Angie]
Angela... Better known as Angie
We are animals... Animal House... wut we are... animals
Uh yeah uh yeah uh uh uh yeah uh uh
All I could do is give you me if you choose to believe it's on you
I live in peace I could sleep but I don't choose I'mma animal the promos
The station, the movies rap Rebecca Lobo
I run elbows with people you couldn't a "Hello" from
With a mask and a gun you don't gotta ask how come or where I'm at
I work! I wanna make that clear to cats
Nuttin's free and no you can't run to me
I'm ten years deep you to young for me
You could sleep while I drop album #3 and
Yeah you could hate but somebody lovin' me
Evidently #1 at 3 with videos on MTV
You could learn from me then it's back to the streets can't be serious
Haha that isn't funny album still sold can't be curious

[Hook]
Animals that's how it is that's how we are
Walk with our heads up high cuz we
Animals-straight beasts 18 hours a day work no sleep
We are animals that's how it is that's what we are we are animals
Walk with our heads up high cuz we animals- straight beasts
18 hours a day work no sleep

[Verse: Sacario]
You ain't know em like the highway patrol
I stay on a roll like Joe Smooth on your back I got creative control
A vocal coach shows singas how to flow
When our engineers songs we verb highs and lows if the shit ain't clear
This year I hope you chose to retire or expire cuz what I propose is a resonation
Cuz the animals is aqua now and all your deticated fans is rolling with me now
I gotta lock to the 5 0 1 n 3 now you gotta watch you can rhyme doin them freestyles
I rather not just do it I make records and write sixteen bars in 500 seconds
It's Sacario AKA Mr. Guntalo BDS news track
My spins is a problem so BMI throw me parties
My publicin is lots a dough we animals get me and "ang" espacio

[Hook]

[Verse: Angie]
Look I'mma professional (I'ma professional)
I'm not stressing you I do what's best for me
You do what's best for you (best for you)
I'm not concerned with the bullshit
Never was (never was) I'm wouldn't check that respect that
I meant cuz bloods, kings, nietas, and zulus (zulus)
All over this world most who do you
I put in work interviews, shows, promos, rehearseals, reverse moves
All of that shows back to interviews
No time for self, none nigga drive-through diner
No time for my health I'm dyin' hehe
I wonder how I'm surviving myself
Angie OG baby got the title in belt
Queen (quueeeeeeeeeeeeeeen) of hip-hop radio
Through the many years blood sweatin tears
Be clear happy to be here on the sequel I'm still workin
I know you got hate in your blood it's still hurtin

How many women cook and clean, wash the clothes
Work a job, come home, mop the floors, watch the soaps?
Nah, no time for that, besides The Young and the Restless is kinda wack
Plus thats that time you can be in the gym
Gettin ya legs tight, gettin ya head right
Doin it every night in summer time almost
You wanna ass lookin firm when they come up close
One of single mother types wit a couple of kids?
Nuttin come before them, don't give a fuck who it is
You a proud ass woman, never cry for help
Been doin it for years all by yourself
For cryin out loud, can ya get your props?
Wanna pull your hair out cause the shit don't stop and
Ya nigga wanna stress, gettin no rest
Takin no breaths, it's P.M.S
Wanna know when do I get my day
Wanna pick up my girls at the highway
Gotta get away, gotta do it now, gotta walk into the sun, ah ah ah

Get up off my back and give a girl some space
Because we're livin' in a big bad place
I just really need some time to have a little piece of mind and
Breathe, breeeaathe!Christmas in the city, boy
Ain't nothing like it (word up)
Yo, remember last year
I think we was on tour last year
I ain't tryin' to be (word up) in the city
That's what I want
Christmas in the city

Christmas jams at the tunnel
Chop through hustle and bustle
Snow and lights make wonderland
Out of this concrete jungle

There's a miracle on 34th Street
On a train, yeah, that lady
With all them bags, you see

Radio City for the Christmas show
We making Angels in the snow
Giving honey lots of kisses under Mistletoe

Snowball fights at courtyards
See Spanish Harlem sing Feliz Navidad
New York state of mind
At Christmas time
In the city

All the children showing
Their new clothes and toys and things
That they got for Christmas, this year
Their full of happiness and cheer

On Christmas in the city
I'm so glad I'm living
To see another Christmas Day
Got to show the Lord I appreciate
His blessings on this special day
It's Christmas in the city (hey)

CHORUS:
Christmas in the city
(Christmas in the city)
Ain't no place I'd rather be (yeah, oh)
Out of all the places I could be
I'd rather be
(I'd rather be)
In New York, chilly

Rockefeller Center
Has the biggest Christmas tree of all
You can go downtown and see it all
I guarantee you'll have a ball
On Christmas in the city

Something about this atmosphere
Makes me want to stay right here
I can see the city lights
Watch the cab drivers fuss and fight, on Broadway
And it's Christmas, Christmas, yeah

CHORUS

CHORUS

I want to be chilly
La, la, la ,la ,la
La, la, la, la, la
Out of all the places I could be
I'd rather be home, chilly

Oooohhh Angie..
Ooo-whoaaaa, yeahhh..
Oooh yeah hooooo whoahhhh, ohhh-ye ohhhhh-yeah

(Angie Martinez)
Uh, yeah (ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Uh (ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Uh-uh-uh uh-ah uh-ah-uh-ah
I started in Brooklyn, comin up in the game
Everybody has a story mine wasn't the same
Angela, delinquent, I thought I was grown
I went through a lot things way before I was known
See my moms, she never knew I would make it all start
She was through with the bad grades, the late nights in the park
Causin my mom pain, my life was in the dirt
I played hooky all day while she was hard at work
Sorry ma, know it was hard and my pops was a jerk
She packed her shit and got us out of there before it got worse
Moved the fam to Miami in hopes of changin my ways
A big portion of my mind still remained in a daze
It wasn't 'til we came back my life matured
Success would be the only thing that I was fightin for
I was determined to get there, and keep it hot
Since that day my only goal was to reach the top

(Chorus: The Product G&B)
To every little girl, on every block
That's comin of age tryin to reach the top
I said no matter who you are, you can reach the stars
But never forget, how fragile you are, cause a girl is fragile

(Angela Martinez)
It's crazy, when I think back, sometimes I have to cry
Cause when you young, you don't see how life can pass you by
You don't even really care if you gon' starve or not
This go back to ninety-three when I got the job at Hot
I used to answer the phones for Flex, do overnight spurts
Back then, I was like, "Hey who knows? It might work"
I wasn't satisfied, but it would just begin
Cause in ninety-five, I was every day, six to ten
I put in a lot of work so I could bring in my listeners
I secured a fanbase, although some of them dissed us
I was new at my thang, but I was doin my thang
And I would never let nobody try to ruin my thang
But of course, there were people couldn't stand where I was
Cause although know I'm in, I wasn't made what I was
Through the heat, kept it movin, throw the haters a smile
What would they do if they knew her heart was fragile?

(Chorus)
(The Product G&B)
Angela.. (uh-huh) Angela.. (hahahah)
Angela.. (wooh!) Angela.. (uhh, uhh)

(Angie Martinez)
Overall, it's a rough business, it could stop even you
There's people that's gonna say things that's not even true
Like the one about me not bein down for my women
And I hated the lesbian rumors that went around for a minute
How bout the one that goes, 'Yeah, she goes with him
He bought her the car, the ice, the clothes and rims.'
And I'm sure you all heard she caught one dead in the face
It'd been different if she said what she said to my face
As for men, who knows where my story will start
I went through a relationship that nearly tore me apart
So I'm chillin for now, it's all about me for the moment
Cause there's things that I wouldn't allow
But I'ma be aight though, keep comin with tight flow
Try to stay on the low while I'm watchin your hype grow
Playin the role like nobody can cramp your style
But I know, like you know, that you're fragile

(Chorus)
(The Product G&B ad lib to the end)
