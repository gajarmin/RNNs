[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, hardly home but always reppin'
You hardly on and always second
When I'm awake, you always restin'
And when they call you the answer, you are hardly questioned
I'm doin' classic shit in all my sessions
Other niggas' situations, they are all depressin'
That's why I never follow y'all suggestions
I just always did my own thing
Now I run the game, you stupid motha-suckas
I see all this money through my Ohio State Buckeyes
Shit been goin' good, but good can turn to better
Cause you the type to lose her, and I'm about to get her

[Hook: Drake]
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on, best believe I understand
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, come on, you can run and tell my city it's on

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, wrong way down a one-way
Women don't get saved 'round me, even on a Sunday
Damn, where I get it from? These niggas always wonder who
Then they meet my pop and tell him, "Drake is just a younger you"
And shawty wanna party, so don't let yo' girl up out the house
Or there'll be shots on TMZ of me givin' her mouth-to-mouth
Now she's famous and the paparazzi starts to shoot her
I drive two black cars, I named 'em Malcolm X and Martin Luther
I don't ever play, but I'm in the game lady
They just lose to love, those are tennis games, lady
Have you countin' money, goin' duffle bag crazy
Sippin' on Pink Floyd and puffin Wayne Brady
Damn, Whose Line is it Anyway?
I'm in the daze, you been amazed
Y'all seem to be stuck on that beginner stage
I'm on fire, yup, I've been a blaze
I got dough to blow, but I wanna blow it right, you look nice
And yo' frame makes me wanna bowl a strike, well alright
Guess I might, know what? Fuck it, yes I will
I am more than what you bargained for and nothin' less than real
Put it to ya life

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Bun B]
Bun B, king of the trill, also one of the dopest
Whether the streets or on the mic, I'm dope and yes I'm focused
The gangsta recognize me for my loc-ness, no joke, it's
Time to shake these haters off like the skin of a locust
Or maybe like a python, that's the type of shit I'm on
I wrote this on my iPhone, so let me drop this iBomb
I palm the game like it's a Spalding ball and take flight
From the free-throw line and slam it down like I'm the great Mike
Bun and Wayne and Drake in here, mayne, this gon' be a great night
Look at all these posers bite our swagger like a great white
Try to cross me over I just fake left, then I break right
Stupid animal tricks like David Letterman's Late Night
This that major moment you've been waitin' on for too long
The best that ever did it and doin' it on a new song
UGK and Young Money, too strong
Bound to be in the green like a crouton, so what the fuck is you on?

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
I am the leather jacket, black glasses, All-American bad boy
I own the swagga supermarket and you, you just a bag boy
Cause I got that swag boy, the swag you never had boy
Hate and I will leave your chest the color of my flag, boy
Soowoo bitch, I do this shit, I'll erase you like I drew you bitch
And I keep that toaster, you can come and be my strudel, bitch
I'm so uptown
And mutha-fucka if you ain't, don't go uptown, yeah
And now I'm on that rock shit
But why they let me in? I'mma start shootin in a moshpit
Haha, fuck is you talkin' 'bout?
Weezy in ya mouth, now, Weezy what you talkin' 'bout
Young Mula, baby

[Hook][Produced by Childish Gambino]

[Intro: Ludwig Goransson]
Oh, this is the idea where you're doing, like, one piece of artwork per track

[Verse 1: Bun-B]
Late ass nights come from long days
Doin' all the right things in the wrong ways
Doin' all the wrong shit for the right reasons
Sprinklin' midnight game, call it night seasoning
Haters get salty give 'em cholesterol
Trill O.G, mop up the floor with the best of y'all
Then dry that bitch off with the rest of y'all
And catch a flight to Rio de Janero for la festival
Yeah, and that's word to fit a baldy
Ball hard like it's cement inside of my Spalding
And I'll break your face with a no look pass
Now back to your parking lot pimp with yo little hook ass
I use harsh words cause these are hard times
And trill-ass people, nowadays they're such a hard find
So it's one eye open if I could peep ‘em
And one on the scope, so if they frontin' I can sleep 'em
Man, my flow is so parabolic
The energy'll blow you over even if you're brolic
Goddamn it, now that's one for the Googlers
That fell sleep on they desk and never step their noodle up
Takin' lames out never been new to us
The hardest part of this shit is figurin' which of you to bust
Then step your weight up like GNC
And R.I.P. to Chris Luda reppin' CNC
Straight G

[Hook x2]
There's somethin' inside you
It's hard to explain
They're talking about you boy
But you're still the same

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Rest in peace to them niggas who was dead wrong
Toni Braxton to them niggas, that's a sad song
Cry a river Timberlake, the whole industry
Record the whole album in my living room in Italy
Niggas who wasn't feelin' me secretly want a handout
Keep your mouth shut, I can probably help your man out
Drop a new stack all lames get to steppin'
Drop a new track all blogs go to heaven
Kill the web, man these niggas need they hits up
Kiss her neck, add a dime to the tip cup
She is not "slut," fuck a dude who says so
Just because she's fuckin' doesn't mean she ain't a lady
Kill the whole stage, I never needed a mic check
Semen on my spacebar, fuckin' tired of Skype sex
Runnin' with a new breed, me and Bun B
This hip-hop nation, that big country
Nigga please! We ain't stop for no one
Wu-Tang Generator name, I'm a shōgun
Wu-Tang Generator name, watch him smoke one
Talk a lot of shit, but none of them will approach him
Gambino got first position, the game is ballet
So graceful; drive, he don't need a valet
So angel: fly as I wanna be
Mercy, somebody show these niggas can't hurt me
Woah

[Hook x2][Produced by Willy Will]

[Bun B]
Yeah, when I step in the spot, motherfuckers say "who that?"
Big Bun B, but you already knew that
Live from the state where they chop it and screw that
You hatin' on the trill OG, where they do that? (for real!)
Motherfuckers need to get off the dick, man
Fall the fuck back like a bike with no kickstand
Get out my mix man, just go' get you stuck
Deeper in the quicksand, with no easy fix, man
No tricks, man, those is for kids
Kush in my cigar, and hoes in the crib
Drank, and the 20 ounce froze in the fridge
You fuckin' with PA so you know what it is
I'm sittin on the fours that clack
Comin' down candy in the golden 'Lac
We gettin' to the money like it's Goldman Sachs
And we do it for the pimps that are holding back, let's go!

[Nas]
Look who crept in with automatic weapons
Reppin' QB till the death of him
That nigga that inspired lyrical tyrants like Kanye West and Em
Track record, goes back to the Essence
Smack adolescents who ask who the best is
I'm nasty like gas from a fat man's intestines
I pass it, you gaspin' for breath and you die fast
Gut 'em like a gastric bypass
But ya Nas advocates actors seemed to get typecast in the same role
Since 16 I ain't grow a day old yet my brain grow
Cocaine white Range Rov'
Tats on my body like an art exhibit
I did real good for a project nigga
Was once a Bacardi sipper, now it's Chandon
Fat blunts in the car with strippers
Guns in compartments hidden
I was real young little youth, a novice nigga
Blessings, bowed down, respected
Chowed down, now my food's digested
Pow pow, with my shooters are Techs
That'll bust louder than the noise that I just spit
Let's get one thing straight that my crown ain't for testin', testin'
Chop heads off like King Henry VIII
Guillotine to ya neck bitch
I'm a king in this thing, don't be dumb
Been in this shit since '91
Niggas can't fuck with the style I use
Your fate is sealed, no Heidi Klum
Calm now, was a wylin' dude
Studied cowards and made power moves
Watched Wild Planet seen lions devour food
You can say that's how I move
A monster nigga, and I don't really like doing songs with niggas
There go my nigga Wayne
Let them niggas hate or like my nigga Drake say
"We ain't got time to respond to niggas"

[Shyne]
I'm a villain, I'm a villain, all that happens in the street
Poverty and desperation made me everything I be
I'm a shotta, when I pop up with them poppers burn ya block up
Call the judges, call the coppers, we takin' over Gotham
Word to Poppa, Blood gang, five
It’s that Blood gang five, but green is the bottom line
I run this town, I ain’t gon' lie, they run they mouth, they ain’t gon' fight
They actin' like they ain’t gon' die until I let them 'llamas fly
Flatbush to Bed-do-or-die, from Watts to Larry Hoover Chi
Poverty and heroine, it’s no place for a juvenile
Put greed in our heart, it’s the green that we want
Cash Money is the company and Weezy the boss!

[Busta Rhymes]
They say I’m underrated, but un-compete-with-able
Understandable, being that my rating levels are unreachable
Anything said other than that should be silenced, unspeakable!
And the thought of you being nicer than me, unfeasible!
They ask is what I do ever gonna stop, this shit will never end
That’s when you hear a car crash in the vocal booth got 'em sayin' “there he goes again!"
See now they nominated a nigga to come and
Flatten everything now let me dominate it, nigga run
And they be knowin' that I be blackin' on everything
And make it complicated like a nigga constipated with a gun
I gotta make it what they want and wake ‘em when I come
And shake 'em and bake 'em and take 'em to another place
Ain’t no fakin’, ain’t no kind of mistakin' how I be breakin'
Up everything and be creating a s-s-s-situation when I’m done (DAMN!)
You see I spit National Treasure, discography rich
And I done killed more cats than curiosity, snitch!
Most of you niggas sorry and owe apologies, quick
What the fuck you niggas still hangin' around here for, you apostrophe bitch?
Okay, now enough of that, see now I’m out the door
Tunechi, thanks for giving us a whole 'nother classic with tha Carter IV[Verse 1: Killer Mike]
Hardcore G shit, homie, I don't play around
Ain't shit sweet bout the peach -- this Atlanta, clown
Home of the dealers and the strippers and the clubs, though
Catch you coming out that Magic City with a snub, ho
Lurking in the club on tourist motherfuckers
Welcome to Atlanta -- up your jewelry, motherfucker!
These monkey niggas looking for some Luda and Jermaine
And all a nigga found was a Ruger and some pain
Pow, motherfucker, pow! Come up off the chain
Pow, motherfucker, pow! One off in the brain
We some money-hungry wolves, and we down to eat the rich
Your bodyguard ain't shit, we strip him like a stripper bitch
These real-ass killers move in silence with violence
The minute it set off, we the motherfucking wildest
How you from Atlanta they ain't never speak upon
Where everybody got a sack of dope and a gun

[Hook: Trouble]
And you know just how it go
We ain't playing round with that bullshit
Nigga, we ain't let that shit go
When you come here, you better come correct
This real G shit, you gotta show respect

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Once upon a time in the projects
An O.G. saw a young Bun B as a prospect
Thought that I would understand the streets from a very young age
So he opened up the G code to the front page
He sat me on the porch, said, "This where little dogs sit"
Pointed at the yard, said, "That's where big dogs shit"
He said, "Don't leave til your ass get growed
And don't come back til your ass get throwed
Whatever you want is whatever you can have
Bring the pain and leave em wet, like they soaking in some salve
When you step out on the ave, make sure they wanna see ya
Cause being trill is an onomatopoeia
Be about it like a G, a hater wanna catch you slipping
Try to be a Jordan, but settle for a Pippen"
Player, I ain't even tripping, but I don't really care
Cause my pistol's in your face, so put your hands in the air

[Hook]

[Verse 3: T.I.]
'96 I'm riding with a pistol grip, banana clip
From Simpson Road to Adamsville, I'm repping this Atlanta shit
Nigga trying to handle up, let's see can they handle this
A hundred round at em, that ain't no Louisiana shit
Drinking on that Hennessey, blowing on that cannabis
Amerikkka's nightmare, trap nigga fantasy
A record full of felonies, searching for a better me
But choppers go off in my hood like Iraq, Cuba, Tel Aviv
Shoot a nigga, let him bleed -- fuck him, shorty
Sucker nigga I'll never be, don't give a fuck about it
Quick to run up on that Audi, make em get the fuck up out it
Nigga better be about it, he deserve it he allow it
What's a coward to a kamikaze?
He ain't robbed a man, ain't predator or prey; the law of nature where I stay
I catch you slipping with that K, ain't no illusion, no confusion
Better come up off that cake and all that jewelry or you're snoozing

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Killer Mike]
Wha-da-da-dang, wha-da-da-da-da-dang
Listen to my Kimber .45 go bang
Bang bang, Grindtime, rap game
We the readers of the books and the leaders of the crooks
Predators, we eyeballing all of y'all lames
Let me fall off, I'm taking all of y'all chains
All of y'all watches and all of y'all cars
Well, who he talking to? All of y'all stars
All of y'all rappers and producers and such
No homo promo, homie, you might get your ass touched
Like Def Jam circa '83, you get rushed
If you rolling with some winners, then you rolling with us
I know some dumb country niggas, but them niggas ain't me
Know they dress and look the part, but them niggas ain't G
I don't make dance music, this is R.A.P
Opposite of the sucker shit they play on T.V

[Hook][Intro: Jim Jones]
Jones, Dipset
Byrdgang, bitch
You know what it is
When you see me two twelving you homie
You fuck niggas keep triple nining
Have some integrity, bitch

[Jim Jones]
Balling
Peace Blood, peace almighty
We all thugs and we run the streets nightly
And get my lawyer, why
Cause I ain't copping out
And I fuck with b-boys who bring the choppers out
One shot of that'll have the boys bring the coppers out
And we balling, foreign toys is what we hopping out
My feary side, where we ride
And we all fly high in the Lear G5s
So twist your fingers up and bang motherfucker bang
Get your money up, this cane is what we fucking slang
And 9 trey is what I fucking claim
It's Dipset Cap, the Don of the Byrdgang

[Snoop Dogg]
They call the D-O-Dub, wasn't really tripping cause
Twenty-one, twenty Crips and all of us is cripping cuz
We from a different street all got that different heat
But when we move the Macs for Game we on the same beat
So if you fuck with Blood then you fuck with us
And we ain't busting duds cause we busting slugs
We sure to stay in touch and clean your mess up
And if you from the West Coast, my nigga, W-w-w-w-westside

[Nas]
Game got at me about the remix, it's an honor my nigga
I made rap, one blood, that say I'm signing with Jigga
I got rappers getting mad at me
I got these new jack rappers trying to clap at me
I got these corny wannabe diss-song kings on the radio
Talking bout how they gon' spray and take me away
But I'm the true living legend
I'm not to be questioned
Have your whole hood holler shit about my progression

[T.I.]
You knowing my attitude shitty only a buck fifty
So I keep the Smitty's with me shit how many with me
What you scared, I'm prepared in the mall and all
With two two's you can call me Quick Draw McGraw
Bitch I'mma cut that fool, better call the law
I start spraying make fuck nigga fall and crawl
I press play like Puff, no pause at all
Chopping holes in all the walls that's all they saw

[The Game]
Hip-hop ain't dead it just took a couple shots
I bring it back to life give it a couple shocks
The King's coming no, I'm not Jay-Z
Too many niggas hate me but they scared to face me
This ain't a movie dog, no not Waist Deep
I'm not an actor but I'll show your bitch big meat
She giving one blood, one love on dubs
A hundred forty thousand the first week

[Fat Joe]
All these niggas wanna front trill with them stiff faces
Till them niggas lying still up in stiff cases
Within styrofoam and embalming fluid
I been gone too long and I'm down to lose it
Somebody go and get this nigga a pine box
And I ain't just talking about a measly nine shots
Yeah I'm chopper-happy and my wrist loose
Call me Goldie I'll smack your bitch too

[Lil' Wayne]
504 gangsta New Orleans soldier
Banging underwater fuck around and soak you
Louisiana gunner, I'm bout my holster
And if you getting greasy I'm an ulcer
I'm bicking back being bool on the Eastside
Of New Orleans where the Bloods at the B-Hive
Ain't nothing sweet unless it's Presidential
That is where I sleep now give me my key

[N.O.R.E.]
New York get the blood money, dirty cash still sweet
We with Black Wall Street by the swapmeet with heat
Def Jam they gonna flop him and Reggaeton ain't hot in the building no more
It's ok I get it popping
Back to the forest trees for deep, these little me's
Who took believers an opportunity to breathe
And you ain't gotta go overseas to see Iraq shit
You can come to LeFrak Queens and get jacked quick

[Jadakiss and Styles P]
One Blood we used to the spilling
Came from the hood so we used to the killing
Used to the Black males making cracksales in the building
How else you get the Benz with the suede on the ceiling
Blood in, Blood out
Me and homie back to back
Both loaded working we about to pitch a shut out
I'm New York's king I'm New York's hardest nigga
Anything in between's a motherfucking target nigga
D-B-L-O-C-K, he spray
The hawk'll find a nice home right where your cheeks stay
We got a mean team hip-Hop dream team
Them boys is only in the projects on green screen
Yeah no security, I'll put you on the respirator
I'm the bomb I'm the motherfucking detonator
One dutch, one bud, one burner, one slug
Want a couple casualties, but we'll settle for just one blood

[Fabolous]
What it look like all I say at most
Shooters waiting on the word just say it Los
I let these niggas live yes I saw em pull the plug
Have them goons pulling gloves, leave the room full of slugs
Catch me trafficking on maroon colored dubs
Couple Africans with balloons full of drugs
If they like me tell em line up
While I sit behind team point em out like a line up

[Juelz Santana]
Mic check, one two, one two check
I'm strapped, you strapped let's play two-on-two
Let's go you're eyeing us in the iron bus, boom
Leak you, two liters of red juice, Hawaiian Punch
So what you boys gon do to me, I'm born street
Your life's sweet, MTV's Laguna Beach
Mama told me not to play with fire but
She never told me I would grow to be a lighter

[Rick Ross]
One love to the gangs but I'm in the thangs
Save the colors for the cars see we kill for the fame
The boss made it yeah, we floss flagrant
Shame how I lost your life savings up in Las Vegas
I'm a heavy better, I'm a heavy seller
Keep white in the office call it Jerry Heller
Letting off a hundred rounds let the barrel pick
And we gon sit here and wait for the derelicts

[Twista]
Bitch Chi got Lords and Gangsters show me where them niggas at
Chi got Two Six's and Kings show me where them killers at
Chi got them ballas and hustlers show me where them figures at
Game where them triggers at
Aim at them fitted caps
He got the clips, I got the scope let's get them choppers nigga
He got the kush, I got the dope let's get it popping nigga
Heard he in that cherry six fo, shit ain't no stopping nigga
Hit him in the head and the body with a bullet
When I put him in the cemetary then I gotta holler out

[Daz]
Whattup cuz

[Kurupt]
Yeah rolling with two grips
Glock holding on the hip rolling with two clips
Got two tiny locos ready to take trips
Shake and make trips high stakes to take grips
But they know what's cracking cuz cause as we huddle
They hold cards down nigga like spades and pinochle
West coast gang bang, riders erasing em
Got funny niggas raising up and riders replacing em, cuz

[Daz Dillinger]
Draped in blue, notorious gangsta crew
RIP for niggas who don't stay true
Deep down in the crevices see the jets veteran
Dwelling in the land of the gang bang profession
I'm legendary yes, yes a Westcoaster
Throwing up two C's with two guns in my holster
I'm from Long Beach City a crip next to Compton
Down with my nigga Game if you niggas want problems
From the streets to the suites anywhere we can meet
Del Amo to Compton, Slauson Swap Meet
Worldwide get swept away by the tide
By Gs and BGs, OGs it's time to ride

[WC]
Who the rider, looter through the gutter man
Trued up in them Carolina blue Hurricanes
From the Westside striving to dead em
Where them killers throw that third letter up
Like Raymond Washington and Tookie Williams
Blue jeans, blue strings, blowing blueberry green
Cadillac on blue Ds and a blue tee
Money thick as blue cheese chunking up the dub
What the West be without Snoop and Dub C and one Blood

[E-40]
The Bay Area fuckers we pop em
Open you up if you got a problem
Up top born in Cali-forn-ia
Clean your clock open your can of tuna
Make a choice either it's hell or it's heaven
Get your chest layed out with the FM 57
This ain't nothing to do with nobody
But in the Yay there ain't nothing to do but catch bodies

[Bun B]
I'm coming straight outta PAT like Compton in all black
But when we say what it do they never say holla back
Bun B the OG like '95 Air Max
Neon green outta Flight Club offa Fairfax
Ask The Hundreds, it's doable I done done it
At the summit of rap and I'm watching you haters plummet
Run to it or run from it to Bun it don't differ
Wipe the streets with you like you a swiffer as a gifter one blood

[Chamillionaire]
I'm the realest youngster thats breathing and I don't gotta give a reason
Chamillionaire a millionaire, y'all competing to be competing
My purpose is to get the cheese and as a purpose that should defeating
So shut your mouth, have a seat and be quiet till I finish eating
My label tells me I'm greedy, hogging all the room on your tv
Like Eric they think its Eazy, but it isn't easy believe me
Need to make a room in B.E. television if you wanna be me
Game said he made room for Jeezy, I had to make room for me, G

[Slim Thug]
It's one Blood if you Blood or Cuz
From that number one Thug it's still one love
I rep my blue boy team but I do it for green
I do it for my folks Vice Lords and Kings
All the trappers future rappers standing out on the blocks
Tryna get up out the hood man and stack em a knot
Put your sets in the air scream fuck the cops
We gon rep for the hood man like it or not

[Young Dro]
My feed mashable, murders are catastrophical
Cars is improbable I'm overcoming obstacles
Trapping I made it logical my topic is impossible
I got a partner named Shoe Strang cause shorty real crossable
Shark meat to Pappadeaux, cars be tropical
All guns choppable all blocks are mobbable
I'm unstoppable my calico is toxable
Lyrically diabolical, cushion is not ???

[The Clipse]
Red rum, red rum such power in the tongue
Never in the wildest was he talking to them
Style on niggas but feel it to the numb
Japanese thread brought flavor to these bums
Consider me the savior, look what the Lord gave you
My celebrated presence like the return of Rayful
Frolic in the snow so playful
And reviving the track like we flowing through jumper cables
What duo you know get XXL kudos while copping off Coolio
Classic shit we mastered this left for dead, I'm back
I'm Lazarus

[Ja Rule]
Nigga, one Crip, one Blood
LA, New York
The Game, the Rule, one love guns up
Hands down, can't touch the flow is a bit much
The style wanna keep up
I'd advise you to speed up
With money moving like coke these days gotta re-up
G up, cop some heaters and dare a nigga to act up
You see us in dual seaters and throw it up
It's all hood niggas rep your sets if your Cuz or Blood
Niggas, we all bleed
These niggas can't breathe
Only because the guns are drawn and aimed to part
Niggas that got bullets with names on them
Want em, come get em niggas y'all know where to get at me
Look at me now pass me maybe you can be half me
You bastards, I'm laughing bullets sticking in family
Who sadly gets torn between one Crip and one Blood
Y'all niggas know me, yeah[Intro: DJ Khaled & T-Pain]
I’m for real about this shit, this the remix (welcome to my hood) let’s go, remix, remix, remix
(Where ya hood at, where ya hood at, where ya hood at)

[Hook: T-Pain]
Welcome to my hood
Everybody know everybody and if I got it everybody got it, ugh
Welcome to my hood
Look at all these old school Chevys, 24′s so you know we roll heavy (YMCMB)
Welcome to my hood
Where they gettin fly like a G6, and everybody know this is the remix
Welcome to my hood
Them boys will put you down on yo knees (woop, woop) that’s the sound of the police in my hood

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Everybody on the corner with the work slangin & bangin in front of that liquor store
Blowin money cause I live life fast with this bottle full of yak I’m a sip it slow
Singles double when triple beams take over
Now holla cause they Impalas got extreme makeovers
Couches covered in plastic, babies all in the street now
Wear the wrong color and catch a Rodney King beatdown
Kids hit with switches, mamas is quotin’ scriptures
While Luda's getting head, more gums than baby pictures
Cock my 40 Glock and my partna just bought a replica
Now Asians sayin they don’t keep no cash in they register (hurry up and buy)
We run from red & blue lights to get that green
But whoever got that white is winning like Charlie Sheen

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
Teddy pain, teddy pain, bad man, bad man
Mixed shots, boom boom boom boom boom bang
Man we the best never the less, you know we get it hot
Fire flame flame, fire fire flame
Put me on the track and I’m a really let a muthafucka feel it, when I do it, how I do it, what I do
If a nigga really wanna test (come and test), you can bet that I’m a eat em all day (fuck food)
850 what I represent, Tallahome Florida president
Me & DJ Khaled got these haters lookin hesitant
So keep all that wackness out my ear, (phew phew) that’s the sound of your career in my hood

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
I hope you niggas got your ringside seats, cause it’s whoopass season
Comin to a hood near you, everybody know what happen when you see me comin (Back up!)
I be hurdling & gotcha reguritating & murdering everything gun shots bah bah bah bah bah bah bah
Ya’ll know what it is, I’m coming to get it & others are blocking
I’m runnin the hood and nothin can top it
You can Google it and you can search it
On how a nigga come and unlock it, impossible to stop it
More fire, thunder, pain, I go and heed the villain, he’s adrenaline poppin
Need a medical situation because the way I’m fuckin everything until I’m peepin it
Why you tryna do what you already know that I’m the king with it
And, you don’t wanna come behind me with it bro
Uggh, I killed this shit I ain’t gotta rhyme no more

[Verse 4: Twista]
Welcome to my hood where poor members of faculty backin me
If you ever try attackin me, that could be when I eat em
Especially when I beat em, when they see a bunch of killas and hustlas on the side of me
I’m an anomoly to em, put em on crutches
We’ll sock ya lip first for you touch us, he one that’s kickin our brothas
Much as I smoke the duchess and model chicks that cut us
And muthafuckas that love us, their enemies wanna touch us
I’m a spit a flow as if it was a sin, then the gangstas are restin forever
See a solid 4, then I’m a put it on the fin
Then you know to never test, it’ll be a category F5
Handle military with automatic weapon so let’s ride
Love to the honeys, and everybody that runnin the north
And they whole city from the westside

[Verse 5: Mavado:]
Welcome to the gully where we not take bad up
Big Spliff in my hand and Hennessy in my cup
You see the gal them we have up is like some angel adopt, them fat and grab up
You hear me when you pass the gate written at the entrance violate
A straight death sentence to live you must be great
To be a snake know repentance
We coming at you with vengeance

[Verse 6: DJ Khaled:]
Never slippin', I’m ballin
Puff keep on callin
I don’t see none of you pussies, fuck that shit you be talkin
Rep Miami the ghettos (Dade County), every hood and the projects
And when I drop off my singles, I’m droppin one of my targets
Lord forgive me for my sins, I gave you hits
I gave you “All I Do Is Win“, I live this shit
And, we the best, it’s no pretend
I touch a million, throwin hundreds in this bitch

[Verse 7: Birdman:]
Real real nigga numba 1, hustle fly with my son
I come from uptown, G5 tommy gun
Red flag everyday, hundred mil ready to spray
Swagged out nigga, Bugatti with the paper plate
Blowin on some good nigga, feelin good nigga
Stunna island, Me & Khaled on the wood nigga
You understand, shinin like I know we should
Birdman YMCMB we good nigga

[Verse 8: Ace Hood]
*Broward!* Ace Hood in this bitch ho, kickin down in yo front door
Knock knock, you hear the Glock cock and that thing pop on the 4 4
Posted up in that same block, I’m in the drop top with that bank roll
Young nigga, I’m out here
Can’t name a place I can’t go
Ridin round with my 50 grand
And they wonder what do that safe hold
Middle finga them feds and that’s why I pledge a part of my G code
And fuck them prosecutors, hustla connoisseur
It’s we the best forever, make sure you spread the rumor bitch

[Verse 9: Fat Joe:]
Good coke, hard ride stashes in the bodyshop
Only way to break them bricks down is karate chops
Niggas gettin left right in front of the marble precinct
Leave em like them Jordans, red dot leakin
I’m 15 when I first startin coppin pies
You 46 just turnin blood, stop it 5
It’s like the only way to make it is supplyin things
Hoop dreams dunkin over cars, let the choir sing

[Verse 10: Game:]
It’s that black raw, black dawg pullin up on that black home
Compton that’s my backyard, that’s where I used to get them sacks off
But, now I got platinum plaques in the back of the 'Bach
And I’m back with Dre again, Aftermath
We the best, Me & Khaled, Dre & Em
Detox, RED, that’s back to the back
Step in the club with my hat to the back
Nigga I’m so hood even tho I’m livin good
Niggas still in VIP strapped with a gat
Drop a couple stacks then it's back to the trap
Couple hoes in the back, red wheels on the lac
Red rum, if you try it niggas (Westside) throw it up now

[Verse 11: Jadakiss:]
They knockin packs off, they lettin gats off
Medicate, benefit cards scratch off’s
Savin every dime, tryna choke a quarter
And they ain’t sellin crack, they sellin coke & water
Smokin or ya snortin, they coppin all the Jordans
Nothins more important, steal em if you can’t afford em
I’m gettin to the money, I need another comma
Some of em love the drama, more than they love they mama

[Verse 12: Bun B:]
Welcome to the land of the trill, where everybody walkin with they hand on they steel
And, a model is a supply & demand any will
You went outta line with the wrong man then get killed
When ya damned if you will & damned if you won’t
Lotta dudes sayin that they can but they don’t
Lotta boys sayin that they G’s and they ain’t
Mess around, get laid down in the paint
Better do what you say, and say what you do
For I come around ya hood, broad day with the crew
They got them fists, AR’s, AK’s and them twos
And they will gladiate all day, what it do
R.I.P. to the trillest that did it, to my G’s on lockdown
Stick with it, think I’m a stop reppin PAT, forget it

[Verse 13: Waka Flocka Flame:]
Welcome to Clayton county, my house got surrounded
Enemies tryna drown me, but my hood still around me
Rookie of the year, no freshman cover
Shawty 16 years old, with 4 baby mothers
First rapper ever to jump off the stage on BET
And, since Pac go to Hollywood to keep it street
First Woo to put T. Rodgers on the TV
Everyday it’s a party on Grove street

[Outro: DJ Khaled - talking]
‘We The Best Forever’, June 28th. It's gon' be a hot summer[Shawty Redd (Producer of the track)]
Jeezy, I know you ain't gon' let this shit go down like this nigga
I'm hearin these niggas in the club, niggas soundin like you nigga
Bitin your motherfuckin ad-libs, bitin your motherfuckin style nigga
What the fuck goin on nigga?
You better check these motherfuckin niggas mayne, real fuck wit real nigga
And these niggas ain't real out here on these motherfuckin streets nigga
Especially these fuck ass industry niggas mayne
Nigga we been doin this shit since ninety-five

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
Last time I checked I was the man on these streets
They call me residue, I leave blow in these beats
Got diarrhea flow, now I shit on niggas (geah)
Even when I'm constipated I still shit on niggas (let's get it)
Got some Super Friends in the Legion of Doom
Stay blowin purple shit that keep me high like the moon
(yeahh) I'm an affiliate, I know hitmen
I'm a hater like you, fuck my wrist then
Niggas sneak dissin', that ain't how we play
Fuck with mine, get ya drama like the DJ (that's right)
Now tell me I ain't real, this AR that I'm holdin got a gangsta grill
Went from old school Chevys, to Beamer coupes
Got a hundred niggas with me and errybody gon shoot (yeahh)
Try me nigga, that's your first mistake (ha-ha)
Eat your lil' ass up like a chanterelle plate
The whole pie like Domino's, yes indeed
I'm tryna stack my bacon up, I need extra cheese (hey)
You can try dawg, but it ain't easy (nope)
Mix the flake with the soda, you got Young Jeezy (damnn)
You still wanna talk blow man?
Soft white like Alaska, call me snowman (heyy)

[Hook: Young Jeezy]
Smoke purp' by the pound, Goose by the fifth
Re-up on the first then again on the fifth (yeahhh)
We trap or die nigga (geah, oh!), we trap or die nigga
And these hoes love a nigga cause they know that we the truth
Got the Chevy same color Tropicana orange juice (yeahhh)
We trap or die nigga (geah, oh!), we trap or die nigga

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
Post on the block, rain, sleet, snow, sunny (sunny)
Slow motion, don't nothin move but the money (geah)
Trap all day (day), with no lunch breaks (nope)
It's dinner time but a gangsta cookin pancakes (ha-ha!)
Rubberbands when we wrap them stacks (stacks)
Time to ship it outta town, you know Saran's the wrap (yeahhh)
Think ahead incase the K-9's get loose (geah)
Inner tubes like the tires on my Mongoose (heyy)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Bun B]
Yeah, back up in the hood again, where it's all good again
Ridin candy slab, grippin on the wood again
Outta line niggas get back in place where you should've been
In case you don't understand, I'mma make it understood again
King of the underground, my gangsta will never fail
You 'bout to make me go postal for fuckin with my mail
You got the connect, but you ain't got the clientele
You the hoax and niggas know it, that shit ain't hard to tell
Rat bitch, recognize that your cheese ain't finna sale
I'm finna break some bread with the feds? You dumb as hell
I been around the block before, sold it all from rock to blow
And I don't fuck around, when the feds in town I got to go
Respect my mind cause I'm a trill old schooler
Summer time get too hot, I wait for winter when its cooler
U.G.K. for life, free the Pimp, you know the deal
In P.A.T. it's Trap or Die and we ain't down for gettin killed

[Hook][Verse 1: Ro Spit]
Check, yeah, the track got hot once I got on
I wear my heart on my sleeve Comme Des Garcons
I know I’m the shit, my French Pardon
A king in the booth I get my troops march on
We outta here, bars drop ya thinkin’ I’m a enigma
Cause I been had swag back when it was charisma
You know I’m a champ by how I’m raisin' my fist to
Not be number one I couldn’t live with that stigma
I figure, I was at the top and I’ll never slump
Neva pump fake nigga I’d rather dunk
You feelin’ good about yourself go head bet a hun
I take ya girl then ya pride, then the cheddar come
You’ve neva won and ain’t dreamed about ever winnin'
Second place the highest place that you ever been in
I do whatever for the cheese, I’m forever grinnin’
This verse amazing and it couldn’t a had a better endin’

[Verse 2: CurT@!n$]
Curtains, I’m the best at it, number one
With the flow, KRS at it
And I’m handin’ out L’s like Nike I’m a chess addict
You try to battle but you lost like a Meth addict
I’m like Meth at it, I’m the fuckin’ man
I done ran them all like Cunningham
No gun in hand, but these warning shots
Try to diss me, then I’m on your block
You lookin’ shocked, like we done fucked up now
I stay in the cypher like puff, puff, pass
No Spliff, but I’m a star like Busta man
Already said it once, but I’m gone tell ‘em again
I’m number one, uno, no dos
I’m like an atheist I got no hope
For your week raps, you can keep that
I got the game all Twisted like Keith Sweat

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
What you know about, being the best at
Any place you reside or rest at
Used to have to check back, now I hand back checks
And can’t remember the last time I seen flat chests
Out of town luggage lookin’ like a chess match, Louis
Or a tournament, chain look like a ornament
Me and your bitch fornicate and she ain’t on no foreign shit
But I hit her from behind and leave a wet back
And then I pass out
Then I took ya girlfriend & turn her to my mascot
Hometown hero but I never pull my mask out
Bet the crowd love me love me like I hit the last shot
Sometime your first shot, can be your last shot
So see what I do when the ball get’s passed out
Yep, but everybody call me Big
Go hard or go home, so I don’t ever see the crib, bitch

[Verse 4: Bun B]
Say, I’m bout to handle my business, who is this
The Big Dawg of the South, don’t forget this
Now sit back and bear witness like LeBron
To the King, AKA boss I’m so the Don
All that, been that, now I’m ahead
On some other shit tryinna get my hands on my bread and don’t
Let it be said that I do not run it, run it
I bet you what you tried to do, I done done it
Ridin’ foreign cars, doin’ foreign shows
Makin’ foreign money, fuckin’ foreign hoes
Held down VIP and popped bottles
Made it rain up in the club and knocked models
Later for that mane, it’s all in the rear view
I got my eyes on the prize in the clear view
Ya gunnin’ for the top spot and yeah I hear you
But me I ain’t three and I’m nowhere near two
So looka here dude[Hook]

When I was 16 used to fuck hoodrats, it's not a big thing
A few years later did some major upgrading
See a top-notch, I say "Hey, what's up baby"
(16 Hoes) Can't find your lost whore?
She's probably with $hort, playin' at the golf course
Another ego, a hole-in-one
The game ain't boring, my hoes are fun
I got (16 Hoes) all nicknamed Bitch
Make Daddy happy, y'all get that dick
Since they're everywhere, you figure I'll stop
Couldn't be a better player than me
Nigga, I got (16 Hoes)[Verse 1: Phil Ade]
Two wrongs don't make a right, we gon' make a left tonight
This love is unofficial, we don't need no ref tonight
Let me know when the coast is clear
You keep moving close, come near
I swear, I would give it you right here
Baby, I'm so sincere
I got weed and a little bit of drink, too
Back it up, let me see what that thing do
Told me to keep it on the down low
Well, let's go, this a level I could sink to
Fuck or things you gotta think through?
Cool, take your time
And after you say "fuck it," get on your knees, let me take your mind
If there ain't no ring, then it ain't no thing
I talk that talk, but it ain't no game
Fuck yo' nigga, I don't pay him no mind
While he stare, blow a J whole time
I'm in the building, my section packed
Hoes at the door, ain't textin' back
And my nigga B got a Lexus truck
If you don't give a fuck, we can sex in back
I'm a risin' icon, I'm on a roll
You a good girl, was on honor roll
Went and got you a good man
But you curious, so you wander though
Now we on the low, while he in the crowd
My fingers all through your hair
You wonder, though, but you got your doubts, so I whisper all in your ear

[Hook x 4]
It's two o'clock in the morning
It's two o'clock in the morning
I'm yakked up, and I'm horny

[Verse 2: Phil Ade]
You wrong for it, but I'm all for it
You knew I was gonna be here, you hit the mall for it
Not only that, you made that nigga pay
That nigga 'bout to have a cow, while I give his Chik-Fil-A
D-E, I'm a major pain
In the neck, get 'em wet like Navy trainin'
In the back, he think she's being a fan
Well, I think she the next one to be in the van
Man, she was born rich, she thinkin' what she want
Tonight no different, I ain't the one to tell her "don't"
Nope! That's his problem
Got her A$AP, like she in Harlem
No Twelvy, just Belvy
And I'm drunk, you ain't gotta sell me
Just say the word, and I'll pay the tab
Too drunk, I'll pay the cab
Tell your man that he can have you back
With ?????? like Fader Mag
We fucked up, makin' out
Snuck out the party, barely made it out
Hopped in the car, all shaded out
Got her hands on me, trying to take it out
My hands on her, trying to take it off
I pull her pants, she shake it off
Her phone loud, and it kept going
So I turned the key, and heard Bun's song like

[Verse 3: Bun B]
Sittin' back in my slab
Swisher sweets in my ash tray
Swangin' wide in my ave
Livin' my life the fast way
Rollin' through my hood
Bending corners on Vogues, mayne
Smelling like that good
My eyes out for them hoes, mayne
Got one in my vision with them Isabel Marants on
Now I'm on my mission cause she got them skintight pants on
White tee with no bra, I'm lovin' them titties, though
She lookin' like a star, don't stop, get it - get it, ho
Big ol' ass booty, no shots and no implants
I'm 'bout to do my duty, let yo' boy up in them pants
Ass soft as cotton, legs thick, and they solid
One look at baby girl, man my shit got brolic
She say she want a player, now she got one, a hot one
I'm in the driver's seat, and shawty ridin' shot gun
Drop the top, we rollin' out, ridin' off in the sunset
It don't take long to realize, it don't get no triller than Bun get
Hol' up

[Hook x 2]"Sippin, sippin on lean, sippin, sippin on bo'"

[Bun B]
Comin down grippin grain, diamonds up against the wood
Tops drop, blades chop, trunk is popped, I'm lookin good
Swangin down the boulevard, chunky deuce, the fifth is shinin
The queen is ridin shotgun and Finger's behind me
So never you mind me, I'm just hustling, grindin
My pockets are heavy and my diamonds are blindin
My pistols are loaded and cocked so know that I'm ready
I'll die for my family dog but I'll kill for my fair day
R.I.P. to my baby bro, UGK until
It ain't no stopping this movement, you lose on the real
Cause we keeping it trill, that's from ashes to dust
We got paper to make and fake nigga's asses to bust
If you down for your hood, and you bangin that Screw
Put your sets in the sky, cause this one is for you
Keep on keepin it true, fuck haters and again
Cause we don't play the game to say we play, we play to win

[Hook: Mistah F.A.B.] {X2}
Leanin to the side, you cain't speed through
Two miles per hour, so everybody sees you
Ridin by myself, with the pistol in the do'
"Sippin, sippin on lean, sippin, sippin on bo'"

[Mistah F.A.B.]
Candy on my big wheel, yeah man I'm still a kid
Twenty-six, rims same age as me, can you dig?
Ridin down the block, knockin pictures off your wall
Just showin off my grill made by Paul Wall
Alpine speakers in my grill on blast
Like my boys in Texas, hittin corner on them slabs
Seat laid back, you know how us pimps be
Keep your head up Bun B, rest in peace Pimp C
A mill' on mine rolled back to back and young millionaires we haven't scratched
Rhyme through the hood and habitat, candy paint look like some cabbage patch
Haters hot, they mad at that, Chamillionaire, how F.A.B. get that?
Two dimes in a car, how bad is that? King of the jungle, you an alley cat
Prince of the coast brought Cali back, just threw some D's on a Cadillac
Smoke so much, got cataracts, been rollin up for a matter of fact
F.A.B. get love where F.A.B. is at, from the Bay to the South where them slabs is at
Oakland down to Houston, only rollin with them savage cats

[Hook] {X2}

[Chamillionaire] {*Over Hook: Chamillitary mayne, yeah*}
It's gon' be, F-A-C, T to the Feds gon' mess with me
And F-A-B, when they see, mixtape money yes they pay me
Mugabe, Inspector G, bring 'em all cause they cain't get me
Ten vehicles parked in the yard, pick your choice, I'll get that key
Take that jet out to West, let's swang and get our swerve on
Hit that strip in my whip, gon' strip and let them sexy curves show
Vehicle sittin very low, pimp that caddy very slow
They like "Yeah, Chamillionaire, the realest I done heard holmes"

[Paul Wall]
I'm leanin to the side sideways, sittin crooked
My Jolly Rancher paint got all of the people lookin
I'm beatin down the block, givin the streets an ass whoopin
Peep the way a player move, take notes lil young-un
I'm movin slow mo', leanin off a potent fo'
Pistol in my lap, plus another one in the side do'
You know I'm just a young hustler all about my doe
Gettin cake and stackin up that paper, I need mo'

[Hook] {X2}

"Sippin, sippin on lean, sippin, sippin on bo'"[Lil Jon voice sample throughout]
"Oh!-Oh!-Oh!-Kaaaayyyyyy"

[Slim Thug]
Slim Thugga! Bun B, T.I.P. baby!
Boss Hogg, Dirty South!

[Hook 2X: Slim Thug]
When I hit the club all the girls show me love
Buying out the bar, got drank by the jug
In the V.I.P. with the chicks and the drugs
This is T-I-P, Bun B and Slim Thug

[Slim Thug]
I got drank by the pint, dro by the pound
Headed to the club and Tha Boss top down
Slim Thug bout the grind, represent H-Town
If you love me you gon smile, if you hate me you gon frown
Cause me and my Boss Hoggs bout to ball till we fall this year
I won't stall, Slim Thugga want it all
Going solo! first CD out that's not slow mo'
Here's another hit thanks to dranking the do-do
Fa sho though, we got the club shut down
Tryna pick which chick I'm a cut now
Got a fetish for thick girls that's caramel brown
On a hunt and up, guess what I just found
Come in VIP with me boo, while we post up
We blowin purple stuff, we pouring purple stuff
We glowing from wrist up, you can tell that we rich
It's Slim Thugga, T-I-P and Bun B bitch!

[Hook]

[T.I.]
22's on a brand new coupe wit no roof
Hundred fifty dollar tennis shoes, no suits
We some ballers pimp, you oughta be followin our suits
No ad-libbing nigga just do like I do
Don't get it confused, cause dude I'm not you
If you ain't heard the news I'm known as the truth
That's why I'm at the bar buying all this Grey Goose
Passing it to them broads, cause mayne is they loose
That's why nigga Slim Thug, they man what they do
Say the black one a slut, but the red would cut too
Give em numbers to the suites and tell em to fall through
And tell that nigga E.S.G. and Paul Wall too (ohh!)
I know Bun B had been fun wit them freaks (yeah!- yeaaaaah!)
Do it like a G for Screw and Pimp c

At the superbowl pulling groups of hoes six deep nigga!

[Hook]

[Bun B]
We going hard in the paint like Carmello (Carmello)

Shorty shake ya jelly like J.Lo, she curvy like a jello
Damn baby put me up before I even said hello
Is it the car? is it the ice? is it the grill? (is it the grill)
Cause I'm a star that paid the price to keep it trill (keep it trill)
She at the bar, she lookin nice, she on da pill
And she got two more wit her ready, so tell me how you feel (hold up)
See pimpin ain't made, nigga pimpin ain't raised
Nigga pimpin is born, pimpin since its early days
These niggas get to trippin playa pimpin ain't lazy
And if ya miss Pimp C throw up ya dueces and ya tres (mayne)
We thought of many ways and perfected the grind (grind)
Making million dollas moves, six figga checks we can sign (signed)
Slim Thugga you up next to shine, and I can't even lie
Wit me and T-I-P man you done wrecked 'em this time foo! (time foo)

[Hook]$50 thousand stuck into my Louis bag
I'm married to the game, call it my newlywed

Born broke nigga, I been on the hustle since
Now my niggas on the board holding corporate meetings
I feel like what I live like
Dead president: covered up in green and white
Oh I love that
Rack up 50 thousand bitch, then it's good night

[Hook]
$50 thousand stuck into my Louis bag
I'm married to the game, call it my newlywed

Live broke or die rich: gotta be persistent
And when I look into my daughter's eyes
It gives a nigga chills

I started with a C-note
Got 2 50-slabs and chopped it
Chopped the whole ounce into 20's then I hit the door
Went in for the 9-piece, now my trap is going live
Now I got enough for a whole thing, so holla back
I call up my connect, tell him I'm ready for the pigeon
Light a tree up bitch![Hook x5: Bun B]
Five on the kush, twenty on the drinks
So loaded in the club that a nigga can't think

[B.o.B]
I said I'm thrown to the side, like a lateral
I swear tonight I'm doin' major damage, it's collateral
Fifty on the potion, one hundred on the smokin'
Panoramic roof, but we ride in slow motion
Patron pass to you, top shelf we toastin'
Top models, tops poppin' off, Kelly Rowland
It's whatever, I never let up, I never feel better
A house full of freaks and they'll never say never
My seats all leather, my jackets all leather
Got PETA pissed off cause my pillow full of feathers
Since day one I stay down like a cellar
Bun B, K.R.I.T., B.o.B. we some fuckin' trend setters

[Hook]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Ok, I roll up and I pour up to the motherfuckin' top
Pimp C, twenty-four, what's a whip if it don't chop?
Subwoofers in my cushion, what's a trunk if it don't knock
Digi on the dash, if I want it then I cop
Cause it's G ho, let me work this wheel ho
Is there difference cause I'm young, huh?
What shit you think a real nigga live for?
Drink lean and pop pills folk
So far in the sky, you can hear God talk when I crack my window
And clear out this endo

[Hook]

[Bun B]
Well it's mista bigga, swisha picka up, but what's the deal though?
Rolling with your sister, twisting big and blow and kill bro
Trunk popped open, speakers kick it like a steel toe
With a big old bag of that southside swag that I pick up by the kilo
All the trill note till they recognize, haters get on the sideline
Killing roaches like pesticide, then lead em off of my timeline
Getting older, but I'm colder, better with age like I'm fine wine
Killer on the mic like Grind Time, how would you like to live my shine?
I'm too fresh and I'm too clean, getting thrown by routine
And I'm so wavy they like to pay me and this all gravy like poutine
Pimping baby, what you mean? I'm with B.o.B, you with K.R.I.T
And we on the job, trees is lit, so get off the knob playa, we the shit

[Hook][Intro]
Chi town what up?
It's DJ Moondawg gettin' too stupid
Now check this out, man
I got a new banger for my brother Naledge
We gonna take this on, we at the Ace Baller
And it's going down right now, total cezar
It's a new joint, a'it?

[Hook]
We be in it, they tripping
One way gripping
On the corners where they blacked out
From what they were sipping

[Verse 1]
Hey, Spot, I'm the man
Chevy trunk sound like a marching band
And I didn't came out, it's all good
Joy feeling me? Women all would
Driving down the block
Like what else would a brother do?
Driving down the block
Getting stains like it's something new
She said she want me
What else is new?
You say you got a man
Well, bitch, what you expect to do?
Cause summertime [?]
Ain't no romance, we fucking on the late
We ain't got to hold hands
Round up in my club
Pussy in my lap
Girl I'm trying to cut
[?]
I ain't gonna save you
But I might come to your rescue

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Just getting head right now
When the G
Bip, bip, bend it over
Till' I fuck you to the beat
Bip, bip

[Verse 2]
Psycho drama all blasting a ride
Women big and a bag full of eyes
Now we sitting in the back of the ride
And I really want to take a ho back for the night
It's sundown, it's sundown
My knees don't come down
It's once in a lifetime
Girl, come have some fun now
Bar Louie, table shots
Pyramid full of glasses on the table top
My niggas zone told me I ain't have to pay
Feel like ew, cause' the day was a good day
One night stands ain't really that bad
One night stand was the best I ever had
Lighting up Cohibas, they don't let me drive
Feeling like I'm Jack Butler
Never let a nigga ride with me

Hopin one day I could get in the game
It was all a dream, wishin for the money and cars
And to live the lifestyle of the stars

Of where I came from (from) and what I've been through (through)

[Hook] - w/ LeToya Luckett ad libs and Notorious B.I.G. sample until the end[Verse 1: 8Ball]
Myself at all times, I’m so allergic to phony
One of a kind, original, means I’m the one and only
God put me here to be humble and help my family survive
Sometimes I’m a victim of ignorance in my own pride
The devil be workin’ on me, I make it so easy for him
God be talkin’ to me, I light up the weed and ignore him
Money be on my mind, so much I hurt the ones I love
I move four hundred of stacks and rarely do it because of the love
My cock, it conjures me like it’s bigger than all that small talk
That’s why my listeners be so rapped up in 8Ball's thoughts
I target just how I see the sense verse that melt the surface
Seem like the lack of love have given the industry beat on purpose
I brush my shoulders off and keep it unique whatever I speak
Somebody must like me cause every album I did leaked
Content harsh, my heart won’t let me talk it soft
You niggers is ready or friendly, find something else to talk about

[Hook]
I’m allergic to phony, I’m allergic to fakes
I’m allergic to suckers, I’m allergic to snakes
I’ll be sneezing and coughing
Got me coughing and choking
Thank your fuckin’ which is pimpin’ boy, you must be jokin’

I’m allergic to phony, I’m allergic to fakes
I’m allergic to suckers, I’m allergic to snakes
I’ll be sneezing and coughing
Got me coughing and choking
Thank your fuckin’ which is pimpin’ boy, you must be jokin’

[Verse 2: Bun B]
I’m from the land of the trill, Port Arthur Texas the city
Where bras beyond the black option, they gut the gangsters get greedy
From the jets on the west side where they throw up their sets
To the east where they put in work with no kinds of regrets
I’m sayin’ so many thangs the average foul couldn’t handle
See brother killed brother, pull out his lights like a candle
Seein’ gangsters turned into suckers in ten seconds flat
Because it ain’t just where you from, is where the fuck are you at
But if there’s one that I’ve learned in all my time in this game
Is don’t make hopes niggers and ho shit take you out of your lane
So from the shit I refrain, before weak dudes I’m a verdict
I’m the king of the trill so if you ain’t real I’m allergic
Bitch move around

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Killer Mike]
These boys ain’t official, they soft as a tissue
They claimin’ they mean but they fuckin’ the bitch
They claimin’ they bang but they colors are changin'
They stitchin’ the Kafka, eliminate thing
These rappers is lame, these rappers are liars
How could you be at this fraudulent guys
Before I do that I will find me a job
Or find me a fake ball and grab of the rod
It could be her, it could be him
If they’re good then it could be them
But that would be me cause I’m opposite that
Opposite line, opposite wet
Never a liar, I’m right and exact
Exactly right when I’m rippin’ the mike
The life I recite is exactly mine
The logical sight is exactly high
See first she was trippin’ and rippin’ and grippin’
And now you’re his what? And drunkin’ the thugs
Seeing you suckers is driving me crazy
False and phony, but fake for days
If I see you posers you’d better pray that I’ll never catch you alone
I’m grabbin’ that tone and puttin’ that bullet
Right through your b-b-b-bone

[Hook][Bridge: Lantana]

Yeah you sittin' on 22's but they factory mane
You're trying to be like me, you see but the fact remain
For me it's easy to offer protection bro its a natural thing

Smoked out and they pour it up, if I came down then it slow it up
Like oh man, hold up, PA get throwed up
That's Lantana they can't stand us, it's all hustle no luck

[Verse 4: Pusha T]
(4 in the morning I ain't seen my bed)
All I ever wanted was the money and the cars
Bag full of dope and a pretty ass broad
Never did I think about the time or the charge
I was busy worrying bout buying out the bar
I was busy flying out linking up with Czar
When you all got money, it's hard pointing out the star
When them dollars fall, them hoes start to follow
We just seat back and gloat cause we got 'em
He want war, it's on sight when I spot 'em
Can't do haters, head shots when I dot 'em
Yeah, it's all hustle, no luck
Get this money and we ain't giving no fucks

Drizzy back up in this thing I'm ready, what's happenin'?
Gone for surgery but now I'm back again
I'm 'bout my paper like a mothafuckin' scratch-and-win
World Series attitude, champagne bottle life
Nothin' ever changes so tonight is like tomorrow night
I will have a model wife, your bitch is as hot as ice
Every time you see me I look like I hit the lotto twice
(Drake you got 'em right?) Yeah I got 'em Bun
I love myself cause I swear their life is just not as fun
Neeks got the weed, Hush got a gun
CJ's got my credit cards and a lotta ones
Yeah, I'm in the city of the purple Sprite
Someone tell Maliah I'm on fire, she should work tonight
Call the King of Diamonds and tell China it'd be worth the flight
I'll be at my table stackin' dollars to the perfect height
Work somethin', twerk somethin' basis
She just tryna make it so she's right here gettin' naked
I don't judge her, I don't judge her but I could never love her
Cause to her I'm just a rapper and soon she'll have met another
That's why me and Lil Jaz bout to spaz, can you keep up?
I'm just feelin' sorry for whoever got to sweep up
Yeah bills everywhere, trill everythin'
And Drake just stands for Do Right and Kill Everything
I love Nicki Minaj, I told her I'd admit it
I hope one day we get married just to say we fuckin' did it
And girl I'm fuckin' serious I'm with it if you with it
Cause your verses turn me on and your pants are mighty fitted
Ugh, damn, I think you caught me in a moment
Like I catch 'em stealin' flows cause I swear I never loaned it
And life ain't a rehearsal, the camera's always rollin'
So come and get a portion of this money that we blowin' cause it's on

[Hook: Drake]
You should come with me
If you got some time this is where you wanna be

This is what they mean when they talk about the life
We can go all night long
This can last all night
I'm with if you with it

Tell them open up the doors, they gotta let us in

Go get us Sprite its for the drink, back together bitch
Mr. Doin' It doin' it, what could be better bitch
The dynamic duo, a two man dream team
My pockets stay swollen, call me Mr. Cream Jean
Rocking white diamonds, that vanilla cream bling
They got the game locked down, call it sing sing
You cats straight down in Houston, me proper dos
In a corner booth chilling with some proper hoes
I hit Toronto girls, hold me for ransom
Til I let 'em buy me Polo or they throw me ransom
Damn son, it's like the best of both worlds
That's your wifey and your side, ya getting the best of both girls
So I'mma go ahead and leave the clock running
I ain't finna stop going, you ain't finna stop coming
When the head boy banging, it's like the Funky Drummer drumming
I go right to left and left to right, back to forth, it's nothing
This is something for the gangstas, something for the riders
With a pistol and the money and boppa right beside us
We highly flammable, you better not ignite us
You suffering from put one in the pussy nigga ride us

Gettin' money everyday: I'm a groundhog
Bout to scoop your girl up like a ground ball
I walk light so I don't piss the ground off
Man I swear my bitches do it 'til they suck the brown off
Ugh, that's nasty
Yes I am Weezy but I ain't asthmatic
James Bond cologne, honey I put on
Make 'em run and tell their friends like a marathon
Voice baritone, haters carry on
Beat the pussy up, call me Larry Holmes
Young Money's Jerry Sloan, I turn every stone
When she masturbates to me, that's how she learn every song
To women I condone better write me when I'm gone
No I'm not that thuggish not that ruggish but I do pack Bone
Uh, I'm a love machine
And I won't work for nobody but you
It's only me and her cause the Bugatti a coupe
It's Blood gang, slime but I parlay with Snoop
I ain't lyin' I shoot, you don't need signs for proof
Turn you to a vegetable like you lyin' in soup
And when I'm in the booth, bitch, the lion is loose
Man I got so many styles I am a group
Damn, I'll be gone 'til November
But fuck it I ain't trippin', I know Drizzy gonna kill 'em
I'm stickin' to the script like lint on denim
Mama said if the rules ain't bent, don't bend 'em
Real nigga talkin', shut the fuck up, ho
Gotta do it one time for Haiti, what up, Zoe?
Weezy F Baby and the "F" is for Front door
Cause that's where I bring it, Soo Woo if you bangin', muthafucka

[Hook][Bun B]
The people think it's all about the fame
And the money and the status and the game
But it's deeper than all that

[Mac Miller]
They just want the women and the cars
Getting high so they can chill with some stars
But it's deeper than all that

[Bun B]
They thinking that it's all about the shows
And the chains hanging down on your clothes
But it's deeper than all that

[Mac Miller]
We're here to change the world with this thing called rap
Homie, believe me, it's all that

[Verse 1 - Bun B]
I got that money on my mind, the grind
And the ability, the knowledge and the know-how
Stamina and agility
Soon as I step in the facility these haters start
Testing my civility, I'm telling you
They killing me. Some of them feeling me
And some of them be grilling me but
I just blow my kush smoke up to the ceiling G
Yeah, and take a toke of the Swisher smoke
They got the paint and the brush, but not the picture, loc
What is an emcee if he can't rap?
Just a monkey with a mic just waiting to get slapped
What is a DJ if he can't scratch?
The one rotten apple that's spoling the whole bag
What is a B-Boy if he can't break?
Might as well do the Dougie or even the Harlem Shake
And what is a graffiti artist if he don't tag?
No homophobia, but he's a fag
Cause it's deeper than all that..

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Mac Miller]
One time for the world cause we do it for y'all
That logo light up in the sky when the studio call
Moving the crowd, get em loud without a gimmick
Spit with a golden ticket, I'm whipping it up in minutes
My feet up in this game
Rapping even made a divot
Don't worry about the critics
If it's happening now, forget it
For my heart is where I give it
Stay thinking about the future
When I'm rich, I'mma call my mom before I call the movers
These haters are just losers
Hate to see you winning
Gave my all from the beginning
I'm in it for extra innings
Here to change the world like a change clothes
Wouldn't mind a little bankroll, pesos
But I"m right here for way more
What is somebody if they can't love?
A hater.. someone give em a hug
We here to change the world with this thing called rap
And homie, believing is all that..

They say it's always darkest before the dawn (before the dawn)
And that you don't know what you got until it's gone (until it's gone)
I thought I knew what I had but I was wrong
And that's why I gots to write this song, now c'mon (now c'mon)
Say man I thought it would of been a long time for us (time for us)
And many more years on the grind for us (grind for us)
I thought the future held a lot for us both and it was brighter
We were super tight but finna be super tighter (super tighter)
I guess I just assumed we had more time
For us to make more music (music) and write more rhymes (rhymes)
But never in my life could I ever have seen
That I would ever have to lose the other half of my team (for real)
You take away the glitter, the gold and the gleam
Say man I wonder to myself what does it all really mean
Nothin without the people you love
Say man I miss my brother, but I know he's lookin down from above
And there's an angel

[Hook]

[Bun B]
It all began on Shreveport Ave., sittin off in the den
Makin beats and puttin paper to pen
We was determined to win, and you couldn't tell us different
Mama West was cool with it but Monroe kept trippin (he kept trippin)
It seems just like yesterday sometimes
Sittin in ya bedroom (huh) writin dumb rhymes (man)
You makin beats on the insonic (sonic)
And we was smokin dirt weed cause it wasn't no chronic (wasn't no chronic)
I still remember when we started the crew
It was me, Mitchell, Queen, Jamal, Jackson and you
Started out as 4BM but then we ended with two
That's when we introduced the world to the U
To the G to the K, Underground Kings, DJ Byrd
Pimp C and Bun B, we kept it G, say word (say word)
Who woulda known back in '92
In 2008 I'd have to write a song sayin I miss you but it's true

[Hook]

[Bun B]
Just for the record let me go ahead and say
I love my brother Pimp C and man I miss him every day
Yeah my heart still hurts (hurts) and the pain's still fresh (fresh)
But I'mma put God first, to keep that pressure off my chest
And remind me that I'm blessed to have had him, as a friend (friend)
A ride or die homie that was with me 'til the end ('til the end)
Real talk, man we was closer than kin
And I know, that I'll never have a partner like that again (like that again)
So Chad Butler I just want you to know

And they gon' always remember that you was here mayne (mayne)
Cause I'mma make 'em remember, that's why I'm here mayne (mayne)

[Lil' Razah]
I know your watchin over me
Last night I saw you in my dream
At the crossroads I'll see you there
At the crossroads, I'll see you there
My friend, my brother 'til the end
Can't wait to see you again
Save a place in heaven for me
Save a place in heaven for me

[Hook][Refrain: One Republic]
I'm holdin' on a rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearin' what your say
But I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down, but wait
Tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
OK, I'm talkin' bout a
Good girl, gone bad
Crooked world, wrong path
Right Mom, wrong dad
I sing this song mad, but not mad enough to shoot you
But it just eats me up, like some barbecue from Luther's
In the morning with the roosters
On the corner with the boosters
And she's the fresh-cut and they're on her like sutures
And I wanna talk to her
But her momma has to school her
I wanna see her better
She's the weather of my future
I don't wanna see another hurricane
Baby you can kill the pain
If you just let me explain
Trust me I know what I'm sayin'
You will end up on the track of an on-comin' train
Stuck in the passenger seat
Travelin' through the fast lane

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Well once upon a time, there was a mom and a dad
Who on the outside, had everything people wished they had
A beautiful daughter, two-story house, two-car garage
And a white picket-fence, wrapped around the front yard
See daddy was a doctor
And mommy was a banker
Mommy's job got outsourced
So now mommy's dranker
Daddy had a malpractice suit
Now he's a snorter
And all this shit is takin' place
Right in front of the daughter
She says, Daddy what's wrong
But he's just too high
Mommy what we gon' do
She just get drunk and cry
Caught in the middle of two wrongs, tryin'a do right
Looking for answers all alone in the darkness of night
Shit ain't right

[Refrain]
I'm holding on a rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearing what your say
But I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down, but wait
Tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around
You say that it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late[Intro]
Money make a pimp, pimp hoes
Hustlers sell dope, thugs gun smoke, what?
Money make the world go round as the world turns
Money make the world go round as the world turns

[Verse 1]
Nigga I need money to maintain, hustlin' ain't a game
Nigga go against the grain gon' get tore out the frame
TVs in the Range, I'm into nice thangs
I slang weed, cocaine and heroine
50 Cent, that's my name, nigga I bring the pain
You thought shit stay the same, nigga shit gon' change
Put a bullet in your brain, nigga at close range
Run away with ya rollie, your rings and your motherfuckin chain
Ain't nothing funny mang, I'm about my money mang
Bitch get down on that track and get my money, I ain't playin
Better understan what I'm sayin what I'm sayin, I ain't playin
I'll be in front of your crib, layin, with the Mac to start sprayin
Any nigga that's in the game, for the fame, gotta be a lame
Crackers'll put ya in chains, box'll drive you insane
Sun can't shine all the time, man it's gotta rain
That ho loose as hell, you betta crack the whip, mang

[Hook]
A pimp ain't a pimp with no mothafuckin' hoes
A hustler ain't a hustler with no mothafuckin' dough
A thug ain't a thug if his gun don't smoke
A playa ain't a playa if his ass dead broke

[Verse 2]
I live life in the fast lane
Man I ain't got nuttin to lose, everything to gain
Either you with me or against me man ain't nuttin change
Nigga, you.. go against the grain, I'll make you.. walk with a 'caine
Now nigga now who you gon' blame when shit ain't the same
Nigga nobody hears your name, you got down wit a gang
O thirty-one blood, y'all niggas do your thang
You got two felonies, fuck it, go out with a bang
Y'all niggas wanna hang with niggas that filthy rich
They ain't even got to talk to take your bitch
One look was all it took, she seen the Benz-o
She seen them TVs and them big old rims, holmes
Ayo the bitch useta bring you dough used to be your bottom ho
Now your paper comin' slow, she feel like she had to go
Roll with them rich niggas and ball with them ballers
Politic with the willies the real shot callers

[Verse 3: Bun B]
I got one life to live, follow that light that keeps on guidin me
Haters tryin me, hoes is a-bidein me, media ride me
King of the Underground so the streets is steady hiding me
Representin sure tasters, the yay' keep takin pride in me
Streets Deciple slide-in me, status reports the badest
You caught walk in the black top wit fat rocks and had his newport
I can't stay away like Too $hort, I gots to break a bastards back
Tore em up, get lem ready to port, put 'em on the master track
I blast the facts the life in the grill, gorilla pimpin
If I have to mack ya wife then I will, it's me and 50 Cent
My nigga, live in trife, and thats real, talkin shit on us
Thats like pullin out a knife and dont kill, that's on the Trill
I'm on for million wit your pit, in the clit that shit true
I split through, your defences, so relentless, get you
Without you even knowing got you strippin and even hoeing
You don't wanna let the pro in the door, this what we showin

[Hook]

[50 Cent]
Is your bitch your bitch or is your bitch mines?
Is your bitch your bitch all the time?
You done got your paper, now it's time I get mines
Except the serve and everything'll be fine, bitch

[Outro]
Runnin from pimpin, bitch you need to run to some pimpin
Wit them cheap ass payless shoes you got on ho
You still ain't figured out what a ho supposed to look like
Look at you motherfucka here, huh bitch?
How you gunna catch some dates lookin like that ho?
Bitch get off the sidewalk and into the street
Bitch the sidewalk is for pimpin bitch![Trae]
I know you haters better run, I'm coming for you
And everyday a nigga repping, and riding for Screw
I was keeping it in my chest, now I'm getting it out
I know you spectators in the game, better close your mouth
I got a lot of my time invested, up in this game
It's S.U.C. till I'm dead, ain't no need to explain
I'm in the Maab with guerillas, and we coming in packs
The only friends we got deep, and coming with black gats
So niggas'd back back, I'm a man dude with a attitude
And I'm too quick to click, Lil' Trae is a damn fool
In my zone leave me alone, I ain't trying to be fucked with
Everything that I got, is everything that I wanna roll with
Me and me and myself, you niggas bad for my health
Now I'm pumped up like Superman, with a uppercut to be felt
I ain't playing with what I'm saying, you cats better start praying
For Deebo commits to spraying, and everybody be staying

[Hook]
Why, these fellas talking down
Don't they know, why we'll ride
And make somebody slide, beware
Why, these fellas talking down
Don't they know, why we'll ride
And make these bustsas hot, beware

[Bun B]
I'm chilling in my 1's, chopping game on my celly
My iced out cross, hanging down to my belly
Got your lil mama, butt naked shake her jelly
I'mma put her on a tape, and play it back on the telly
Boys hate to love the street show, when we showing up
I give me back the same middle finger, they be throwing up
They can't afford the pints, by the case that we po'ing up
Young in the game, it's time to start growing up
Get you some hustle, get you some grind
Show me some muscle, show me some shine
Fuck trying to crime, off another nigga name
It's just a matter of time, 'fore I run you out the game
Because I can't believe the nerve, of these hoes
Trying to use my nigga Pimp name, for benefit shows
Fin to start kicking in do's, with the macks
Trying to let that shit pass, now I'm coming for your ass fool

[Hook]

[Trae]
It's the return of the mad rapper, industry nigga subtracter
That be greed up in the fists, that be clinched like a black panther
I'm sick and tired of you fakers, that try to twist up the game
So now you gotta see me, like the 84's that I swang
My Glock I cock and I aim, my name you fin to respect it
You let me off in your world, then I swear to God I'mma wreck it
You must of thought I forgot about you, acting sue a crowd'll watch you
I gotta get that up out you, your people gon be without you
On top of that, niggas be using my homie name
Saying the Screwed Up Click, so they can get them a little change
Hopping from dick to dick, and I ain't even gon say no name
I feel like I wanna click, so now you gon feel my pain
I'm Trae, and I ain't bar nan nigga in this drama
Or mama, I weave and I swang sending em through a trauma
They tell me to let em make it, but really I ain't the one
Them bitches did it, so now they gotta see me when I come

[Z-Ro]
Where the real niggas at, cause I can't find none
Everybody be talking shit, when they be packing they guns
Quick to shoot a motherfucker, to keep they face from sweating
But when the laws come the main ones snitching and telling
Be these ol' buster ass niggas, killing all in they music
Showing a four pound around town, but never gon use it
I'm registered by my gangsta, you barely touching me G
Now 50 got the audicity, to come and see me
Fuck it whoever wanna get some, can come and get dropped
I'm a grown man I don't get people sued, I get people shot
If you ain't shot, I wonder who gon be standing behind the trigga
Z-Ro the Crooked, cause ain't no love for none of these niggas
Straight Profit to Presidential, trying to scandalize my name
They can't sell records without me, that's a god damn shame
I ain't to blame, why these niggas ain't selling and losing weight
But I'm to blame, when I go off and get the bruising they face

[Hook]

(Z-Ro)
Make a nigga hot, yeeeah
Why you wanna hate me, S.U.C
You niggas can't be meeee
My nigga T-R-A-E
And that's the way it's gonna be
Until a motherfucker take me
Me, and the M double A-B
We gon be thugging
Until we see you niggas deceased

(*talking*)
Straight up, it's my cousin Trae nigga
These bitch ass niggas can't fuck with you

[Hook][Intro]
Saw the drop top like the bezzles in my watch {*3X*}
Like the bezzles in my watch like the bezzles in my watch
Saw the drop top like the bezzles in my watch {*3X*}
Like the bezzles in my watch like the bezzles in my watch
Saw the drop top like the bezzles in my watch {*3X*}
Like the bezzles in my watch like the bezzles in my watch

[T.I.]
I came up bumping Eazy-E, Cube, and Dre (Scarface, OutKast what's happening niggas!)
Eightball MJG UGK
They raised me like Sonny raised C
I always made the money, money never made me
Break me what this bitch you crazy
You seen with the freaks don't think she never paid me
Pimpin get a bitch, break a bitch, hit a bitch, shake a bitch
Spit game till I make this bitch turn these tricks and get me rich
Lick his ass suck my dick bring me back my duckies quick
Who you think you fucking with
I'm serious about this pimpin shit
All the niggas I kick it with looking for a richer bitch
Get this bitch to take this trick for pounds of weed bricks and shit
Broke bitch you get your shit
Before I get another bitch who could fix your shit
My pimp to strong I ain't with your shit
You going to make me split your shit
Two things I ain't seen is this you a phony bitch I can't get
Eyes on the ride yeah right shut the fuck......

[Hook] ad libs (T.I.)
She saw the drop top like the bezzles in my watch {*3X*}
Like the bezzles in my watch like the bezzles in my watch
You saw the drop top like the bezzles in my watch {*3X*}
Like the bezzles in my watch like the bezzles in my watch

[MJG]
Whole mack load it up hard as fine blow it up
M-J-G I know you hoes and been exposed enough
I'll cross a trick over, back a bitch down and post her up
And slam dunk some pimpin in her sister if she close enough

[Eightball]
Lookie here
Open up the door and let a crook in here
Grab the mic a watch these niggas tuck there tail and look in fear
As I bust a round with no shells inside in myself
Lyrics like a concealed weapon sending you bitches straight to hell

[MJG]
Burning up just like in waco texas
Heating up your neckless
Scorching up your afro the devil coming at your
Ass any hard one for niggas who really want it
M-J- fucking G with pussy and titties on it

[Eightball]
Them bitches love when they see pimping come up in it
24 inches under somethin smoking tinted
Hustle hard for keep it cause I love to spend it
Pimping love is when your style is when you love to hit it

[Hook] ad libs (T.I.)

[Bun B]
I came a long way from a posta posta
Till I Costa Nostra kept the toaster closer
Than I'm supposed to well I poast ya procha
Ride like a roller coaster
Pistol whip you hold ya throat then choke you like a croacha croacha rocha
Pull out a light and smoke you(damn)
Pope of Port Arthur, I blessed the masses, stressed the cashes
Still elementary [] classes, couldn't learn it, earned my passes
Pack pistols just to blast it(blast it)
I put it to second guessers I blast it it just to prove it(prove it)
Mother fuckers get a moving(moving)
I born into hustling I grew up tustlin
Gave my muscle in for guarding meek and the frail but hell I put my trust in
My left and right hand grinding threw the night
And I keep my family tight and see some paper like a white man
Balling in the night (man) we haulin' in the white (man) sippin' on purple
Sprite and you can call it what you like
I call what the fuck I feel, play the cards they fucking deal
But we ain't sleeping till they free the Pimp here that's the fucking drill

[Hook] to fade[Verse 1: Killer Mike]
Hardcore G shit, homie, I don't play around
Ain't shit sweet bout the peach -- this Atlanta, clown
Home of the dealers and the strippers and the clubs, though
Catch you coming out that Magic City with a snub, ho
Lurking in the club on tourist motherfuckers
Welcome to Atlanta -- up your jewelry, motherfucker!
These monkey niggas looking for some Luda and Jermaine
And all a nigga found was a Ruger and some pain
Pow, motherfucker, pow! Come up off the chain
Pow, motherfucker, pow! One off in the brain
We some money-hungry wolves, and we down to eat the rich
Your bodyguard ain't shit, we strip him like a stripper bitch
These real-ass killers move in silence with violence
The minute it set off, we the motherfucking wildest
How you from Atlanta they ain't never speak upon
Where everybody got a sack of dope and a gun

[Hook: Trouble]
And you know just how it go
We ain't playing round with that bullshit
Nigga, we ain't let that shit go
When you come here, you better come correct
This real G shit, you gotta show respect

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Once upon a time in the projects
An O.G. saw a young Bun B as a prospect
Thought that I would understand the streets from a very young age
So he opened up the G code to the front page
He sat me on the porch, said, "This where little dogs sit"
Pointed at the yard, said, "That's where big dogs shit"
He said, "Don't leave til your ass get growed
And don't come back til your ass get throwed
Whatever you want is whatever you can have
Bring the pain and leave em wet, like they soaking in some salve
When you step out on the ave, make sure they wanna see ya
Cause being trill is an onomatopoeia
Be about it like a G, a hater wanna catch you slipping
Try to be a Jordan, but settle for a Pippen"
Player, I ain't even tripping, but I don't really care
Cause my pistol's in your face, so put your hands in the air

[Hook]

[Verse 3: T.I.]
'96 I'm riding with a pistol grip, banana clip
From Simpson Road to Adamsville, I'm repping this Atlanta shit
Nigga trying to handle up, let's see can they handle this
A hundred round at em, that ain't no Louisiana shit
Drinking on that Hennessey, blowing on that cannabis
Amerikkka's nightmare, trap nigga fantasy
A record full of felonies, searching for a better me
But choppers go off in my hood like Iraq, Cuba, Tel Aviv
Shoot a nigga, let him bleed -- fuck him, shorty
Sucker nigga I'll never be, don't give a fuck about it
Quick to run up on that Audi, make em get the fuck up out it
Nigga better be about it, he deserve it he allow it
What's a coward to a kamikaze?
He ain't robbed a man, ain't predator or prey; the law of nature where I stay
I catch you slipping with that K, ain't no illusion, no confusion
Better come up off that cake and all that jewelry or you're snoozing

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Killer Mike]
Wha-da-da-dang, wha-da-da-da-da-dang
Listen to my Kimber .45 go bang
Bang bang, Grindtime, rap game
We the readers of the books and the leaders of the crooks
Predators, we eyeballing all of y'all lames
Let me fall off, I'm taking all of y'all chains
All of y'all watches and all of y'all cars
Well, who he talking to? All of y'all stars
All of y'all rappers and producers and such
No homo promo, homie, you might get your ass touched
Like Def Jam circa '83, you get rushed
If you rolling with some winners, then you rolling with us
I know some dumb country niggas, but them niggas ain't me
Know they dress and look the part, but them niggas ain't G
I don't make dance music, this is R.A.P
Opposite of the sucker shit they play on T.V

[Hook][Intro: Trae - chopped & screwed]
Chyeah, 'knowmtalmbout?
You ain’t shit if you ain’t screwed up, fo' real

[Z-Ro] + (Trae) + {Both}
Houston, Texas, home of DJ Screw, we say know’m saying and what it do?
(And if a nigga don’t like it, tell them bitches I rep Texas, topless, in the slab I come thru)
Elbow and Vogues and expensive clothes, candy-paint car our cars, big booties on our hoes
(Got diamonds in our mouth, still represent the south, put the truck up bitch, I’m swanging four’s)
I sip codeine out the styrofoam, 27-10 is the kinda grind on
{I ain’t ever love a bitch, so I’m riding alone, prolly when them niggas ain’t on the kind of shine I’m on}
Big dully trucks with the big rims, and the Cadillac with the fifth wheel
(We from the hood and we keep steel, if you try to jack them you’re gonna get killed)
I don’t wear my britches tight, I wear them loose
Active Athlete for all my footwear, homie I got too many shoes
{I’m the man in my city, tell them niggas I won’t lose}
{Cross that path, and my nigga Hawk, we still gon’ chunk the deuce}

[Hook: Trae - chopped & screwed]
You can me in the hood in the city that I claim
Moving slow, like the music that I bang, screwed-screwed up!
Bitch I’m from Texas, yeah, bitch I’m from Texas
Bitch I’m from Texas, yeah, bitch I’m from Texas
Gla-glass underneath, beatin’-beatin', my block
Pop-pop my trunk, chain-chain fulla rocks
Bitch I’m from Texas, yeah, bitch I’m from Texas
Bitch I’m from Texas, yeah, bitch I’m from Texas

[Paul Wall]
You can find me in h-o-u-s-t-o-n, ridin' in
Candy trim, on pokey rims, wit a ten and her friend
Trae the truth, ridin’ right behind, two cups full and I’m on my grind
Talkin’ dine, respect my mind, I'll show you boys how Texas get dine
Rolex time, top lift back, on my nuts, cuz I got that sack
Papered up to the roof, it stacked, hoes wanna hate but it don’t mean jack
Wheres there’s money that’s where I’m at, that Texas grind, that’s all I know
Bangin’ screw and drankin’ Big Moe, basically get that dough, bro

[Slim Thug]
Northside, where the boss ride, e'ry day I got play outside (huh?)
Leavin’ them haters mouth wide, can't be denied when they see me slide
Through the hood like I live there, shit, I got a few cribs there
All my G’s still chill there, we barbecuin' them ribs there (huh? What?)
Smoke blunts and sip punch like its lunch, every day we do it
Listenin’ to nothin but Texas music, perfect match for that good fluid
Find me in the hood, in the city I claim, everybody dine in H-town know me mayne
It ain't a choice, I can’t change, I'mma rep the north like I gangbang (Thugga)

[Hook]

[Kirko Bangz]
Uhh, I gotta bad ass bitch, parked outside
Yella diamond my wrist, if it’s dark outside
Pull a lil’ bitch then I catch ghost, just a lil’ kid from the ghetto
Never had shit but I got a lil’ bit, when I got a couple hits under this belt
Throw a H up, nigga, I ain’t tryna belch or nothin’, ain't got a whole lotta money but I'm wealthy money
I sip a whole lottta drank but I'm healthy mami, daddy was cool, but he couldn’t really tell me nothin'
Uhh~!... Everybody think a nigga lucked up
Young Kirko, he done blew up, from the H-town, nigga what’s up?

[Bun B]
I’m Port Author, Texas, let’s get that straight off the top
That’s where the hustlin’ and grindin’ and the hatin’ don’t stop
From the westside to east, we out here duckin’ them cops
And coming dine, candy paint, on them motherfuckin’ chops
It’s the land of the trill, that’s where the whole thang came from
And it just a word, or where a rapper get his name from
It’s a way of life, and we live to the fullest
For years, we represent it with blood sweat and bullets
Ho, I’m from Texas!

[Hook]
