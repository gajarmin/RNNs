[Sean Price]
Yeah, we all cool, pa, anybody can get it
Winchester Remington's, any shotty I'll hit it
Yo, dress sloppy, but my rap is dapper
Watch Rosewood go outside and slap a cracker
Yo, various styles and, various hot shit
Killed a nigga on a train with Barry Slotnick, dude
Bottom line, you ain't ready for Ruck
Where your girl, duke, I'm ready to fuck
Do the knowledge, I'm ill
Especially when the god swallowing pills
Spaz out on your bitch while she gobble my dill
All my niggas went through drama, for real
Ruck dred, Agallah, body armor steel, squar from the ville
Untouchable, Sean Conner's got kill
Ya'll niggas chill before ya moma get killed, yo
Untouchable, Sean Conner's got kill
Ya'll niggas chill before ya moma get killed, yo

[Hook 2x: Agallah]
And we gon' give this all that we got
Blow the spot, keep rising to the top
All my niggas, keep rising to the top

[Agallah]
Everyone welcome to the gangsta world of Agallah
Where it's me and my niggas, my bitches, my guns and my cars
My dogs don't care, they'll kill these rap stars
I like ridin' around with a gangsta broad
I'mma gangsta dog, go with the shotty, or I'm shankin' y'all
Wind up in prison, no thanks to y'all
Come back to the block, then I break y'all balls
Get murked right on the spot, so we don't have to brawl
Listen up, pa, don't fuck with Agallah
None of these niggas could never see the catalog
I don't give a fuck if it's digital or analog
I flip, to any style, pa, press record
Give me a million, that's how you blessed the lord
Bullshit me? I won't even step to y'all
Consider the shit, this is what I left with y'all
Look at all the hot shit, that I kept from y'all

[Hook 2x]

[Hook: Agallah, Sean Price]
It's music in the air, a lots of loving everywhere
Everybody, gettin' right, everybody, gettin' right
It's smoke all in the air, everybody wanna share
Niggas is gettin' high, niggas is gettin' high

[Sean Price]
I love spittin raps and flows, I love gettin' stacks of dough
Like I love hittin' rats and hoes
I've been to club, where the stash is yo
Why you bumpin' me, god, actin' up in front of company, god
Got some shit up in the trunk of my car
We can fight right now, you get lumped in the bar
Bottom line duke; fuck who you are
Spit two gem stars out my mouth, give you a couple of scars

[Agallah]
The flame from Ruck and Agallah, and lendin' y'all spitly
We come through like this from Brooklyn, my niggas hopin' shitly
While niggas like Blick Street that be reppin' with me
My nigga Ike Eyes, yo I call him Ike Hitly
It's Agal-litly, featuring Sean Printly
We don't waste no time, we take care of this quickly
For real my nitly, it's about to get off the hitly
For shitly, you know where I'm at, my nigga, hit me
And God be with me, through the streets I move switfly
You want war, with a nigga, pa, then come and get me

[Hook 2x]

[Hook]Onyx

They tried to poison the fetus
We gonna check it out like this
All hail
The high exalted
Yo
My mother fucking name is Fredro Starr
You know what I'm saying?
I'm up here with my man Sonee the money the motherfucking Greeza
And my motherfucking nigga Sticky the fucking Fingaz
You know what I'm saying?
Yo Son
Step to your motherfucking business nigga...word up

[Sonsee]
I’m not the type to be flabbergasted, but all my data’s mastered
It ain’t a madder bastard, boom I had it, niggas get plastered
Soon as I bring what I got in store for this war
Who want it? We got what your looking for
Fuck ya gonna do now money?
Cause it’s the, Sonsee Seeza, Mr. Chocolate bust em like a blister
I get downright depriving on nigga’s   p-rop-z’s; gimme all of these
Ya’ll niggas is puss
What’s the matter, I thrust, bum rush and batterize and assault and catapult
Like a bolt I shock shit
The faker hurter, word to murder, ripping the madder shit to make you BACDAFUCUP further

[Fredro Starr]
Hold up the press, here comes the mess
Worship the best, or die like the rest
You have the right to remain violent
Anything you say can and will be used against you to kill
I’m a tyrant, striking like a viking
A knight in shining armor, death before dishonor
The ruff rhymer, suicidal like Nirvana
The end of your world is just beginning, there's no winning in my inning
Cause dead things cannot effect the living
So I drift into the winds of the ghetto bad weather
I’m lost in the desert but the storm blows me on
Never talk to a stranger, everybody’s in grave danger
Me and my peoples just shout out anger

[Bridge]
Fuck that, we better off dead

[Sticky Fingaz]
I’m considered less than a God, but more than a man
I can knock down a mule like Conan the Barbarian
With my mental powers and my sixth sense
That can raise a dead crowd into a live audience
(so get the fuck out the way)
Or what? Get your ass cut
Cause if you goin to jail they’ll probably make a pussy out ya butt

[Sonsee]
No doubt
Here’s the clique which is known as a black stone
Hard
Fuck around and we’ll shatter your track bone
Scarred
You get for life, I’m concise, niggas get done up precise
Cut up fine and fucked up real nice
Be ready to meet your maker
And die like the Lakers
Faking jackers smack ‘em backwards with the front of the black gat tactics
Straight from the desert-(queens)
Where niggas is desperate
So I'm taking mines from the entrance to the exit

[Hook] (2X)
Get a life?
Fuck that, we better off dead

[Fredro Starr]
Cover me, I’m going in
Move ‘em in
Take em out in the time when niggas seem to always fight a lost battle
Its too late to pray I'm selling one way tickets to hell
"Now, run, tell" is what you punk niggas yell like
Ahhhhh
That’s the sound of your bitch ass hurting
Blindside attack your back with Steel Curtain
Sticky come out, come out wherever you are

[Sticky Fingaz]
So now add all that up to the fact that I’m a nigga that could just beat your mother fucking ass
To hurt your feelings
Cause your shit is trash
‘Chu need people like me, cause they not worthy
Construct my coalition, it’s a demolition derby
To all the spit you talk make the mic smell like saliva
Yuck, you need to retire, resign
I’m ahead of my time, in my prime, one of a kind & out of my mind
And ain't nothing in this world free so me I’ma kick it paid style
I ain't got no smile, I was abused as a child
My moms gave birth to a crazy ass wild one
Bust out her pussy with a motherfucking gun
And started talking slang
Even joined a gang
In suicide scums
I sold jums to the bums
I was the hand to hand man pulling in crumbs
Then I started dealing, robbing and stealing
Got knocked for a killing now I’m known as a villain
So if you want problems I’m ready and willing
And I’ll get up in your mouth like a fucking filling

FUCK DAT WE BETTA OFF DEAD
Please somebody kill me before I put two in my own head...Intro/Chorus: (*sample of Queen's "Sail Away Sweet Sister"*)

Hey little babe, you're changin
Babe are you feelin sore?
Ain't no use in dancin
Don't wanna play no more
*repeat x3*

Verse 1: Drayz

Well yo, yo, waddup?
Boo, how ya doin? Let's go walk and talk
See I ain't about to hawk, I plans to make this short
See I been (where?) in the sewer liggity layin with the crew (true)
And wiggity watchin all the changes that you're goin thru
Now walk, first of all we all can tell you're feelin sore
And that's for sure, niggity now raw like how you was before
I saw you last year, change from the past year
Hit the fast gear, kniggity knew you couldn't last here
You piggity past here, higgity had to hold you down
But then you turned around and stiggity started standing cross town
You gettin a bad name in the fast lane
Gettin a bad frame, niggity not the same and that's a damn shame

Chorus (x2)

Verse 2: Skoob

Yo
Shorty rappin what the deal? Iggity ain't heard from me in a while
See, once a man and twice a child but in your case it's wiggity wild
Let's break the ice and liggity light this weed
Remember you was schoolin me when you was only a seed
Now it's time to school you cos see I'm a nigga that's true
If we ain't see it in the streets, my crew, we heard it from you
A few couldn't understand cos you was raised in the street
To each his own, whiggity where you layed your hat was your home
None see the shining sea, you been the star on TV
See I only knew you by face til I met my nigga P
Piggity put me on to you, tiggity told me to shine
So when you had the time, iggity I had the rhyme
Started runnin with them kids and keepin up with them trends
I never took it as a diss cos me and you was just friends
But now your man's got you on some other garbage
C. Deloris Tucker got you thinkin murder charges
Plus them same cats flipped on you, dissin you
Cos you're sample says "You ain't original", I wanted to get rid of you
But who would figure you would try to play both sides?
You honey rides, you look at your reflection through my eyes, no lies

Chorus (x2)

Verse 3: Drayz, Skoob

And naw man
Now some people are tryin to ban you but they don't understand you
Like me and my man do, when all the drama that you ran thru
(So thankyou) for the Benz, thankyou for the rims and Timbs
Thankyou for the friends, thankyou for the ends that I spend
Thankyou for the weed and all the times you took me overseas
And thankyou for the dreams and all the fans that I please
Thanks from all hardcore, thanks for lettin me be a member
And thanks for lettin me rock your party, shorty just remember

I'll be tender when you're weared, for you's a diamond in the rough
You want the fuck, I know you feel sore but higgity hush
Biggity baby you diggity don't try
We're gon' held you down til the diggity day that we die

Chorus (x2)[Verse One] [Sean Price]:
First of all you bitch niggas actin' all fuckin' silly
Seein', ain't recognizin' how real this rap shit can really be
Fortified, Colt 45 like I'm Billy Dee
Pop you, you, and you for a killer's street trilogy
Sean Price nice with rhymes y'all not feelin' me
Till I slap niggas, now you feelin' me literally
Ayo, it'll be a cold day in Hell
Before you see Ruck, rather see O.J. in a cell
Type that'll run up on your block party
Jump off a dirt bike
Spit physical flames to the crowd, straight hurt mics
Ate the fuck out with this bitch cause her skirt tight
She ain't givin' up the fuckin' pussy, "When you turn dyke?"
Damn, snatched your chain cause I figure it's worth like
2, 3 hundred, gas money, hit the turnpike
Next thing I know helicopters and the searchlight
Damn gotta go, helicopters and the searchlight

[Verse Two] [Agallah]:
Ayo, I beat niggas till they bruise and they bleed with broken arms
Burn niggas
Till I hear the fuckin' sound of smoke alarms
Go to your crib ? the delivery and choke ya moms
I called 9-1-1 before I wrote this song
Killin' niggas, yo I'm doin' somethin' right outta wrong
.45 caliber nigga, yo I tote the long
None of y'all never see me and never do me nada
Jumpin' outta Impalas like niggas wildin' in Guatemala
With gats that holla
Iced out from the wrist the collar
Just image if I sold one of my discs for a dollar
The left hand on my dick, gun on my right
Son in the life, bullets across the street to his fleet
Put up a good fight
Shootouts for about an hour and a half
Alleyway before the L.I.Q. was the only escape path
Shoot through the air, Sha B and son count half
Beat the shit out ya ass
Take your jewels and your stash
We go home to the hood and try to spazz
Got you talkin' all that jazz
And your souls livin' in Alcatraz
I'll out ya ass
Kick bones out ya ass
And they won't know jack shit about ya ass
My flow will lie six feet deep in the grass[Junior Reid]
Sound your horn!
Stiggetty-yooour-higgety-horrron
Yeah! Sound your horn, boy!
You see..
Dem want to kill de youths
Kill de youths and Kings
Dead first at eleven
Never tell de youths that Pokemon be the settin'
Never tell de youths
Send down to earth be the endin'
Now look what I did..

[Hook: Junior Reid]
Mashin' Up Da Earth
Ghetto youths they wanna destroy
But what peace must sanctify we if they use them guns for toys?
Do you ever spend a night in an Upstate prison before?
Not to mention Rikers Island to see dem youths dem sleepin' on the floor

[Guru]
Check the cycle God ended
What's the fate of this planet?
Black on black love and hate's got my people frantic
Peep the criminal mind
The subliminal line
Such difficult times
Automatic pistols and Glock nines
I wish I could stop time
For the cat who drop dime
Thinkin' about his lifeline
A young man told me that my wise words saved his life
It made me feel good
Made me feel real good
Back in the day I used to steal goods
Dreams without means is like a lack of self-esteem or lack of CREAM
I go for delf or roll out for the team

[Chorus 2X
Line 1 only]

[Prodigal Sunn]
Feel the pain of the ghetto through a teardrop
My peers stop and listen from eighteen years
Muslim and Christian We all face conviction
In this moment of oppression The world is like infection
On this block we confessin'
I use my mind as a weapon
Like I told my brothers Glock and Snub
Ain't No Half-Steppin' We gotta live Heaven
And watch our seeds taste the blessin'
I learned my lesson 'bout havin' snakes around my crew
Now I know the evil that men do and bitches too
We had thought by our riches
Some called thugs and snitches
Through the different timeframes
Kid, I watched crime change
In the time of fame
My man is like crack/cocaine
But through the black rain I seen many suffer in pain
We go for gain and pain
Now they rock some fat gold chains
Iced-out name perform a concert, sellin' out in Maine
Own the properties and all types of things
Some say the drug game and the music game is all the same

[Junior Reid]
Ooh.. Pray for the youths
Said me nah gon' cry.. Ooh-ooh-ooh..

[Hook line one only]

[Guru]
We can no longer put all the blame on the man
For those sellin' out I'm sayin', "Shame on the man"
For those fallin' victim I'm sayin', "Make a new plan"
And for those that need a way I'm sayin', "Take my hand"
See this mental slavery causes rash behavior, G
And I have to say for me that I wish it would all stop
Before we become extinct before we all drop
And R.I.P. to the rappers that's been slain
And R.I.P. to the fine young men who've lost their lives
I feel the pain
And do you know what it's like to lose a loved one?
It makes you numb
Especially when it's over somethin' small but ain't no fun
I lose four friends in one year I could feel
Them watchin' over me see their faces still
Some clear and some fear what's out there
For me I have no time to and may I remind you
This is a corrupted world of our design, du'
Peep my discussion no one can changes these things but us, son
We didn't ask for the liquor, crack and guns
We didn't ask for the poor eduction and lack of funds
But I know one thing none of us wanna die
But still we're Mashin' Up this World and I don't know why

[Hook line one only]

[Hook]

[Junior Reid]
Ooh.. Pray for the youths
Said me nah gon' cry.. Ooh-ooh-ooh..
Mom and Dad wipe the tears from ya eyes..
Ooh.. Pray for the youths
Said me nah gon' cry.. Ooh-ooh-ooh..
Ooh-ooh-ooh.. Riot in the prison
Rikers Island
When a gust of G-P-E Babylon will stand to see
So the sentence can't be free
Ooh-ooh-ooh.. Ooh.. Pray for the youths
Said me nah gon' cry.. Ooh-ooh-ooh..
Ooh-ooh-ooh..

[Hook line one only]

[Hook]

[Junior Reid]
Ooh.. Pray for the youths
Said me nah gon' cry..
Ooh-ooh-ooh..[Sean Price]
Who this? Sean Price, groovy shit
Catch a body cop out to a two to six
Lesser charge, yo, don't even stress the sarge
That's my girl pops, why you think she bless the God?
Weed and dope, anything you need to smoke
For the Kings, Ñetas, triple B's and Locs
Five Percent niggas, aiyo, peace God
Knife in ya hand, trynna get a damn piece, god
Ain't nothin' left to do, but pull out ya piece, god
Dig in they face, until you tear out a piece, god
Hearing some things, overall, fearing no things
Set it off on a German, do a year in the bing
You done grow dreadlocks, did a bid in the bing
You done blown head bop, turned queer in the bing
You should hang it up, pa, can't take this stuff
But wait, pops died, go to wake in cuffs

[Hook: Rock]
You come home to the streets, niggas raising hell
Fightin', cuttin', damn it's the same as jail
Only the grimey get over, ain't no making bail
Get torn out the frame, if ya frame is frail

[Sean Price]
I hope and pray my first born, be next to parole
Tired of liftin' weights, playin' chess with stones
I'm tired of things, tired of the riots and gangs
Tired of the jack mac, calimari and Tang
When I come home, ma, I swear to God, I'mma change
But when I, come home, you know the God won't change
I'm bluffin' for real, girl you know the fuck is the deal
Soon as I touchdown, I need to puff on the real
Bang my first floor, pa, never focused, free
But corner violation for smoking weed
As the cop escort me, as I troop to a cell
With a smile, but inside I'm feeling stupid as hell
Man, I'm 29 going on 30, kid
Can't be getting locked up for no dirty dick

[Hook]

[Sean Price]
My life is in danger, my son set it off on the imam
Niggas being easy, how the fuck, can you be calm
Looking bad, son, them niggas deep as hell
Realizing all my motherfuckin' peeps is frail
It's just me, Killa, Rum Dick, Psyche and Will
Dee and a crackhead named Mike from the ville
If I die, yo I'm going out with knives in they grill
All my motherfuckin' life I've been real, yo

[Hook 2X][Verse 1: Jus Allah]
Awww shit, my moms gonna be home before the blood dries
It's so much, it could start a fucking mudslide
So many niggas to kill, not enough time
Y'all niggas don't deserve to see the fucking sunshine
Your whole life, isn't even worth blunt rhinds
You'll die first, weak pieces are the frontline
Keep counting my kill, it could be a million
I'm the reason that you check up on yo sleeping children
I'm already high before I even smoke
I try to stay afloat, while you got a whole in your boat
Any choke coming my way, is getting poked
Wet pussy all around me now, I'm getting soaked

[Hook: Jus Allah]
This is we, this is who?
This is G-O-D, this is you
This is we, this is who?
Y'all want it to be, whatever y'all want it to be
This is me, this is you
This is we, This is G-O-D

[Verse 2: Jus Allah]
Yo, I can't spare love, for small ass niggas that I'm above
You owe me your fucking life, you can pay me in blood
Your spirit floats in the sky like arabian rugs
I fiend for seeing you dead, hate is my drug
I allow everything and all things, big and small things
I got all the rings, calling shots, pulling all the strings
You dumb motherfuckers worshipping a fallen king
You're relying on the luck that your cross brings
While I'm trying to abduct one of your offspring
Cause I go through blood like soft drinks
I could give a flying fuck what the law thinks
I'm not a savage that's in love with the hog stink
You wanna go against Allah's breed God speed
When hell freeze and your motherfucking dog reads
Carefull how you talk to gods who can part seas
One thought and your motherfucking heart bleeds

[Hook: Jus Allah]
This is me, this is you
This is we, this is who?
Y'all want it to be, whatever y'all want it to be
This is me, this is you
This is we, this is who?
This is G-O-D
This is you, this is we
This is who?
Y'all want it to be, whatever y'all want it to be
This is me, This is you
This is we, this is G-O-D

[Verse 3: Jus Allah]
All praises due, Allah unshackle me
Now it's like I got two eyes right in back of me
Now it's like 9 lives keep track of me
Nowadays I keep the fine dimes in the sack with me
Nowadays I fuck, but I don't have a hat with me
But I don't be fucking the bitches you be fucking that's nasty
Y'all savages should be displaces like hazardous waste
All you got is black space in the back of your face
I'm from the master race exactly
God of the planet, boss of the factory
Life is a test, Islam is the strategy
The father of reality, mom of the galaxy
All y'all ? of immaculate waste, have to wait
The God doesn't practice in haste
Never slacking in pace, Only lacking mistakes
Im taking off the tablecloth without cracking the plates

[Hook: Jus Allah]
This is me, this is you
This is we, this is G-O-DOnyx

They tried to poison the fetus

Please somebody kill me before I put two in my own head...[Verse 1: Jus Allah]
Return your motherfucking soul before my next blunt gets rolled
I eat you motherfuckers whole before the blood gets cold
Truth be told you talk like you two years old
Same shit you wanna hold like the purest of gold
When my rhyme begins everything that's on your mind ends
Eat slime from the vines like vitamins
Every message from Allah's like medicine
Everyone of them could purify the Devil's sins
Fucking fool, you probably flunked preschool
We ain't equals, I ain't readable
You're one step above your own mother feeding you
Unbelievable, dumb enough to be illegal
You couldn't get this high without a fucking needle
And a fucking supply to fry three people
Motherfuckers deserve their ugly ass heads hung
Only good fucking devils are dead ones

[Hook: Agallah]
I got nothing but hate for you fakes that be all in my face
For your snakes that's invading my space
Nothings ever gonna ease my head except seeing you dead
Can't sleep till you niggas is dead
There's nothing but hate for you fakes that be all in my face
Jealous niggas be wanting my place
And I won't eat until you motherfuckers is dead
Can't sleep till you niggas is dead

[Verse 2: Jus Allah]
I'm busting right at the priests, fuck your white Jesus
You're blinded by the light of deceivers and disbelievers
The real truth right in front of you
I am everyone and none of you, I gave my only begotten son to you
Return to Earth as a person
Only to see you mouse niggas running from the serpent
Blind and dumb, I'm rhyming till the Devil's rule is done
Allah see's a liar and a fool as one
Raise your holy flag, put me near the President's craft
I'll be riding to Iran with his head in a bag
Niggas know it's on till you dead and done with
Your head's hunted till I'm signing your death warrant
Holding myself down on the black side
Y'all stay on that side, I'm a piece of God magnified
Fucking truth never needs to be advertised
You could learn fucking that one in the afterlife

[Hook: Agallah]

[Verse 3: Jus Allah]
The power that I hold in my hand could fold a frying pan
The air and sand do as I command
And if i want the night to last across the sky mass
The clouds won't even allow light to pass
My crew cleave alien loops inside grass
Roll trees and dutch masks, loot some brass
A must have like my dagger and cloak
And red streaks of blood on my white lab coat
A virgin thirst ____ to give her first poke
She crept over to my crib after church broke
Since, we ain't spoke but I hit it dumb ways
The unsaved, some days I don't bathe
Unphased by the light, the scorching flame
Tears form from the ice dripping off your brain
Even if you cry it won't soften the pain
Your heart is dead, you should go and get your coffin framed

[Hook x2: Agallah][Verse 1: Erick Sermon]
EPMD.. Def Jam.. blazin..

Check it, uh-huh, YO
It's E-Dub on the microphone
My style be Elektra, I'm the male Syl Rhome
Homes, walk around with forty-four chrome
On safety, spike the mic in the end zone
This here ain't the average shit, you used to
Front, and automatic rounds, will shoot you
So knock it off, like Biggie Smalls said Duke you soft
Why you wanna fuck with the boss?

[Verse 2: Parrish Smith]
Where should I start? Breakin' MC's or shatterin' charts?
It's Diablo, PMD Mic Doc with the purple heart
The go-getter, getter, get wit 'er, hit 'er-split 'er
Front and back, and if she wit it, straight in the shitter
So heidi heidi heidi hydro, pack gats and ammo
Funky Piano, van like the fuckin' [tano?]
With more cheese than Lambeau, more heat than Rambo
Break down dismantle when I scramble

[Chorus: Erick Sermon (Parrish Smith)]
I just get down, and I go for mines
Say check 1, 2 -- and run down the line
(Inclined to shine) with techs and (forty-four mags and nines)
Don't get too close because you might get shot
X2

[Verse 3: Erick Sermon]
Uhh, yo, ey, and yo
EPMD, fuckin' with us is bad news
Me and you got different views
What you might say is dope, I say's not
What I might call whack, you'll call hot
The best thing for you, is to think and hope
Or get choked, and hung with The Velvet Rope
Cause you too theatrical, mess around
And end up smackin' you, jackin' you, attackin' you

[Verse 4: Parrish Smith]
That's why it's crucial, so stay neutral to collect the cash
Double beaucoup, just rippin' up mics, is what my crew do
Whatever suits you, pull out the burner, fuck the shoot through
Roadblocks and smear campaigns, with the two-two
Or tech nine, that'll chew, through your waistline
I'm accurate, don't waste mine, spit on baseline
Run with the unseen potential to be on Dateline
I don't fake mine, you blaze crazy, while I pace mine

[Verse 5: Erick Sermon]
Yeah, now why y'all wanna mess with the vets?
We've been doin' this shit, since Dear Yvette, check
I make shit that make you wanna smack your producer
And ice grill him, and make you wanna kill him dead
And walk around leakin', in the bed for the weekend
For playin' with the last Mohican
[Madi gon?] - that's fuck you in Puerto Rican
Keep quiet when you hear grown men speakin'

[Verse 6: Parrish Smith]
Or get smacked, this ain't no game, the shit is serious
Delerious, that's how we leave cats and niggas curious
The true legend, got caught shit you better call Kevin
Big like Dog 40 and the Dutch from the 7-11
I'm danger like Norris the Texas Ranger
The mic strangler, PMD, the fuckin' Head Banger
Mo' skills fo' real for them cats that kill
Pump a nine on the reg behind penitentiary steel

[Chorus][Big Daddy Kane]
Uh uh.. what? Uh-huh
Just put it down baby
What? Uh, yo, yo..

Somebody let the lion out the den, I come flyin out to win
Whatever you tryin bout to end - Kane's comin
Let me explain somethin - we rules the place
You couldn't shine around me wearin a suit from Mase
And that, gruesome face - G, cock the hammer
Let's test his stamina
Or make him smile like he on Candid Camera
I'm wreckin jaws with extra force just because
I have no respect for yours against the boss
Nigga, check your drawers
Don't let it get to where I have to sun ya
And goin back you wonder
Put holes inside your chest like accupuncture
Give me a reason to flip I'll put deez in your lip
Be laid up without deez in your wrist
And you bleed when you piss
Presence alone make the hardest cats soften
Put niggas in the coffin
Play Daddy to a female orphan
I keeps it heated while so many get deleted
And you close to bein the next one to meet it
Now beat it!

[Kool G. Rap]
Chandeliers glare, mahogany floors, house on the shore
With the balcony doors, marble walls like it's Carnegie Hall
Armies of whores walk around in they drawers
Mountains of raw, water fountains pour - take a tour
?? in the floor, draped in velour, paper galore
Master suite dinner table for four
Sittin on four acres or more
Bracin my jaw, scrapin the floor
Home of Capone, gold phone take me to war
Sip the Henny-Rock straight with a straw, lovin the cabbage
Money stashes up in the mattress, fuckin the actress
Bless her finger with ten carats, leather giraffe it
My suit fabrics, silk smooth shoes jurassic
Rip everything from new to classic
Bulletproof jackets that move drastic
Package the her-on in blue plastic
Who blew the racket? G. Luciano with the drug traffic
Homicide's a thug habit let your crew have it

[KRS-One]
Word, word.. feel that! Feel that! Word up
Tony Touch, in the cluth, word up
Word up.. it's KRS-One
Comin through Big Daddy Kane, Kool G. Rap
YouknowhatI'msayin?
Givin you a moment to, to feel this
Feel it up!
My man Tony Touch, came to me in the clutch
And he said, "Yo KRS-One man
I want you to get on this record and
To just represent for the Latin Quarter crew y'know
Y'know the Class of '87"
So I said uhh, ha hah, I said
"What's your name again?" He said, "Tony!"
So I took his name and I reversed it
And when Tony's reversed it spells - Y NOT?
So Y NOT?

It's irrefutable my facts are usable
They might be new to you
But they suitable to the street entrepenuerial
Mentally unmovable
When I move it's your beautiful brutal funeral
In your face or the bodega mural
I can cure all, or kill all, which do you prefer it y'all?
I throw up lyrics like cats chokin on furballs
Herbal remedies and vocal melodies be changin up my identity
From Kool G. to K-A-N-E
Movin em up, movin em up, breakin em all the way down
Takin em up, shakin em up, takin away they sound
You better be ready when I be comin around, layin it down
Divine speech for each, what you think I'm playin around?
I flash right on em, and rock mics for em
But they can't see this MC cause I'm too bright for em
The unraveller, world traveller, philosopher
Timeless, K-R-S, now you rewind this![Verse 1: Ras Kass]
Nigga you still my Stan, mad he can't fade us
So you should hang yourself like Tyler the Creator
Life ain't fair: a saint gets aborted
A serial killer is born, evil gets rewarded
Dear Lord, ya'll vision is distorted
And I wanna save the World but my budget can't afford it
But I deserve that gwap like Kanye and Curtis
A Mayweather life before I lay in riggormortis
43-0 on the mic retire perfect
Couple new niggas hot now they claiming he the furnace?!
They ask if Ras could spit on the sun and burn it
Is Sandusky guilty? You already know the verdict
Yeah! im in the club poppin bottles of Moet
With a Magic Johnson portable AIDS test
Staring up this dames dress, but I dont mean no harm
Amino acid ratchet rap rapid fire bars

[Hook]
Life is like sniffing up a coke line

[Verse 2: Agallah]
Ayo Listen, life is like sniffing up a coke line
Took a scripture out of the Bible and I wrote mine
I'm so prolific like a prophet when I quote lines
Barmageddon with bars, Scarface the world is mine
Dollar bills I'mma burn it, the System I overturn it
New government is emerging, ya'll doin alot of splurging
Its like I'm fucking a virgin, no, my dick is determined
I'm spitting verbal vermin, hate rats like Mark Furman
This gargoyle rap music make you wanna act stupid
Ignorant son of a bitch - fuck Rap Music!
Whites doing black music, blacks doing white music
We can all get along and make Fight Music
I live this shit, I dont even like music
Rather do a heist to it silence the lambs
Most niggas in my hood is dying ofr grams

[Hook]

Yo yall niggas wanna know what the fuck that nigga sean like
Ask elroy al via uncle klondike ask aggalah lord lord rustee juxman
Ask QB Manhattan and Staten and Brooklyn You can ask nah fuckit[Verse 1: Jus Allah]
Awww shit, my moms gonna be home before the blood dries
It's so much, it could start a fucking mudslide
So many niggas to kill, not enough time
Y'all niggas don't deserve to see the fucking sunshine
Your whole life, isn't even worth blunt rhinds
You'll die first, weak pieces are the frontline
Keep counting my kill, it could be a million
I'm the reason that you check up on yo sleeping children
I'm already high before I even smoke
I try to stay afloat, while you got a whole in your boat
Any choke coming my way, is getting poked
Wet pussy all around me now, I'm getting soaked

[Hook: Jus Allah]
This is we, this is who?
This is G-O-D, this is you
This is we, this is who?
Y'all want it to be, whatever y'all want it to be
This is me, this is you
This is we, This is G-O-D

[Verse 2: Jus Allah]
Yo, I can't spare love, for small ass niggas that I'm above
You owe me your fucking life, you can pay me in blood
Your spirit floats in the sky like arabian rugs
I fiend for seeing you dead, hate is my drug
I allow everything and all things, big and small things
I got all the rings, calling shots, pulling all the strings
You dumb motherfuckers worshipping a fallen king
You're relying on the luck that your cross brings
While I'm trying to abduct one of your offspring
Cause I go through blood like soft drinks
I could give a flying fuck what the law thinks
I'm not a savage that's in love with the hog stink
You wanna go against Allah's breed God speed
When hell freeze and your motherfucking dog reads
Carefull how you talk to gods who can part seas
One thought and your motherfucking heart bleeds

[Hook: Jus Allah]
This is me, this is you
This is we, this is who?
Y'all want it to be, whatever y'all want it to be
This is me, this is you
This is we, this is who?
This is G-O-D
This is you, this is we
This is who?
Y'all want it to be, whatever y'all want it to be
This is me, This is you
This is we, this is G-O-D

[Verse 3: Jus Allah]
All praises due, Allah unshackle me
Now it's like I got two eyes right in back of me
Now it's like 9 lives keep track of me
Nowadays I keep the fine dimes in the sack with me
Nowadays I fuck, but I don't have a hat with me
But I don't be fucking the bitches you be fucking that's nasty
Y'all savages should be displaces like hazardous waste
All you got is black space in the back of your face
I'm from the master race exactly
God of the planet, boss of the factory
Life is a test, Islam is the strategy
The father of reality, mom of the galaxy
All y'all ? of immaculate waste, have to wait
The God doesn't practice in haste
Never slacking in pace, Only lacking mistakes
Im taking off the tablecloth without cracking the plates

[Hook: Jus Allah]
This is me, this is you
This is we, this is G-O-D[Sean Price]
Who this? Sean Price, groovy shit
Catch a body cop out to a two to six
Lesser charge, yo, don't even stress the sarge
That's my girl pops, why you think she bless the God?
Weed and dope, anything you need to smoke
For the Kings, Ñetas, triple B's and Locs
Five Percent niggas, aiyo, peace God
Knife in ya hand, trynna get a damn piece, god
Ain't nothin' left to do, but pull out ya piece, god
Dig in they face, until you tear out a piece, god
Hearing some things, overall, fearing no things
Set it off on a German, do a year in the bing
You done grow dreadlocks, did a bid in the bing
You done blown head bop, turned queer in the bing
You should hang it up, pa, can't take this stuff
But wait, pops died, go to wake in cuffs

[Hook: Rock]
You come home to the streets, niggas raising hell
Fightin', cuttin', damn it's the same as jail
Only the grimey get over, ain't no making bail
Get torn out the frame, if ya frame is frail

[Sean Price]
I hope and pray my first born, be next to parole
Tired of liftin' weights, playin' chess with stones
I'm tired of things, tired of the riots and gangs
Tired of the jack mac, calimari and Tang
When I come home, ma, I swear to God, I'mma change
But when I, come home, you know the God won't change
I'm bluffin' for real, girl you know the fuck is the deal
Soon as I touchdown, I need to puff on the real
Bang my first floor, pa, never focused, free
But corner violation for smoking weed
As the cop escort me, as I troop to a cell
With a smile, but inside I'm feeling stupid as hell
Man, I'm 29 going on 30, kid
Can't be getting locked up for no dirty dick

[Hook]

[Sean Price]
My life is in danger, my son set it off on the imam
Niggas being easy, how the fuck, can you be calm
Looking bad, son, them niggas deep as hell
Realizing all my motherfuckin' peeps is frail
It's just me, Killa, Rum Dick, Psyche and Will
Dee and a crackhead named Mike from the ville
If I die, yo I'm going out with knives in they grill
All my motherfuckin' life I've been real, yo

[Hook 2X][Hook: Agallah]
Let me know if you feel it, feel it, feel it
D&D, let us kill it, kill it, kill it
Craig G, we coming with it, with it, with it
Agallah, Rugged Man, Channel Live we 'bout to spend it
Let me know if you feel it, feel it, feel it
D&D, let us kill it, kill it, kill it
Agallah, I'm coming with it, with it, with it
Craig G, Channel Live and Rugged Man are 'bout to kill it

[Verse 1: Hakim Green]
You know the live niggas roll them trees up, Alchemist put the beat up
We D&D up, R.A., Adolf and Craig G, yup
We hit the block up, catch me rolling chalk up
Watching Sopranos late night with a bitch legs cocked up
My flow is like snow cooked up
Bust like mo' shook up
Screaming 5-0, down, crooks up
You lying, don, don't look up
When hungry dirty down niggas hook up
Get your ice took up

[Verse 2: Tuffy]
Cause you wanna ice down you could end up sliced down
When I slug up in your see-through ass like nightgowns
Just pipe down, bring all the hype down
Fight now, niggas pick up the knife, put the mic down
Oh, we in the ninth round, high off Mike's pound
I lay them lies down like you roll the dice down now
Two pulls and pass, oh, that bomb hash
I'm tired of niggas wants more ass than Stacey Dash

[Verse 3: R.A. The Rugged Man]
I'm a hand grenade holding, Chinese star tossing
Screamin' Jay Hawkins in the Walkman
Bomb threats to the airports
I'm a twisted fuck with sick thoughts
On your block with a blowtorch
I'm straight country, rednecks stay away from me
Jack Dempsey, G Tony, I don't need money, I'mma be bummy
I'mma be crusty and ugly, King Kong Bundy
We are Channel Live, Craig G, D&D all-star
R.A. The Rugged Man and Agallah

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Craig G]
This beat's a bar stool over the bats, smack
Only 10 seconds elapse before your vertebrae snaps
Ayo, I heard 'em say raps, but them shits were half-assed
Totalize, we catching rhymes belonging glad trash bags
Gang members flash racks, carjackers stack jacks
In a warehouse 5 miles northwest from Six Flags
The pigeon style's fake like [?]
Telling tales about you shipping the yayo
Bullets fly from a window [?]
Making you and your clique lay low
One shot, I'm Michael Corleone, nigga, you Fredo

[Verse 5: Agallah]
It'd be a cold day in jail before you fuck with Agallah
Fuck rap, yo, would blow the gats for y'all
I'm the tact that'll take the weight off your backs
My shit'll make them real niggas insert them clips in the macs
Y'all can spit 'til ya lips is black, your shit is wack
All them gangsters [?] shots when I chill on the track
And it's real hard for most cats to get on the chart
What I think about you rappers, I won't get to that part
And bullets get to the heart, niggas rip you apart
I'm already at the finish before you get to the start
Ain't nothing like Ag and the chemist, D&D presented
Roll that blunt again, nigga, ain't enough weed in it
In the street where them niggas will cheat lyrics
Fake gangsters with weak feelings
Enter the first round, we came with it

[Hook][ONYX sample *throughout*]

Sticky 1:Go ahead,do it,PULL the fucking trigger!

[gunshot]Chorus 2X: Lil Dap & Agallah

As the weed burn kid, I'mma make it in life
Am I qualified for a crib, a kid and a wife?
Do I have to stay worried getting shot stabbed with a knife?
Gettin caught gambling dice, to hustling ice
Going to jail once, going to jail twice
A nigga sold, 25 to triple life yo

{Lil Dap}
We took time in the ghetto building with O.G.'s
To askin me, do we know the code of the streets
Walkin the beat, in the hood where it's all good
A Tear For The Ghetto, they don't wanna be in hood
It's like a tear in disguise, decides to get wise
And through my eyes, I can see through these fake ass guys
I turn a thug into a rapper, a rapper into a thug
Throw that ass into the street, show him no more love
I guess these cats have brought reality from the one of above
Too deep in the game, can't concentrate
Droppin bombs in the ghetto, like the game of Kuwait
Meditatin with my niggas, cuz we just can't wait
36 months left till the year 2G
I've granated with my niggas across the land and see
Because we channel thru our music and thats all we know
Comin from the ghetto with that ill ass flow
Got to reach the top, got to reach our goal
Separating real brothers from these weak ass souls
What? Channel thru our music and thats all we know
Comin from the ghetto with that ill type flow
Got to reach the top, got to reach our goal
Separating real brothers from these weak ass souls

Chorus

As the weed burns kid I'mma make in in life
As the weed burns kid I'mma make in in life

Interlude:
Why are we doing this?
Because the families have no love

{Agallah}
At the city, crime found dead eight o'clock sharp
Nigga get murdered, right by the string of a harp
Cannot get saved from the heart, and I'mma bring this art
Like an exhibit in Greenwich Village nigga, Agallah Mozart
Rock shots to block and drive the Benz slow start
Lyrics keep going when Po's say pull over
I'm just a soldier, man, I'mma go far
Some of you never made it, cuz you refuse to know god
Comin at me with crowbars, when I'm comin out of 4 cars
Fillin so many maggots in me, Corleone tron
Puerto Rico my homeland of the man sipping the motar
My whole clique, G.I. Joe, y'all are Cobra
Stay fake niggas, is always caught John Blaze
Contemplate, moves of Agallah 8, make a mistake
Yo I come to your wake, with 5 niggas with bandanas
Yo, your clip insert banana arm

Chorus 2X

{Melachi The Nutcracker}
Just to make it in life, I used be livin trife
To be precise, run up on you with a gun or a knife
And that's word, to my fam on 183rd
Yo A-Mob, and fuck what you heard
The Battle Cat is back, but I'm no longer 16
I'm down with Dap and we don't shine we gleem
The Group Home team is tight like old slacks
Off the meat rack, slappin weak rappers back
You get caught up in my trap, and see that this is no act
I wan't more than a small stack, move against me and fall flat
Is the black man qualified to make it in life?
Or will he die trying, to earn some stripes
I gotta eat, so you will meet your defeat
To make my mission complete

Chorus 2X

As the weed burns kid I'mma make it in life
As the weed burns kid I'mma make it in life[Junior Reid]
Sound your horn!
Stiggetty-yooour-higgety-horrron
Yeah! Sound your horn, boy!
You see..
Dem want to kill de youths
Kill de youths and Kings
Dead first at eleven
Never tell de youths that Pokemon be the settin'
Never tell de youths
Send down to earth be the endin'
Now look what I did..

[Hook: Junior Reid]
Mashin' Up Da Earth
Ghetto youths they wanna destroy
But what peace must sanctify we if they use them guns for toys?
Do you ever spend a night in an Upstate prison before?
Not to mention Rikers Island to see dem youths dem sleepin' on the floor

[Guru]
Check the cycle God ended
What's the fate of this planet?
Black on black love and hate's got my people frantic
Peep the criminal mind
The subliminal line
Such difficult times
Automatic pistols and Glock nines
I wish I could stop time
For the cat who drop dime
Thinkin' about his lifeline
A young man told me that my wise words saved his life
It made me feel good
Made me feel real good
Back in the day I used to steal goods
Dreams without means is like a lack of self-esteem or lack of CREAM
I go for delf or roll out for the team

[Chorus 2X
Line 1 only]

[Prodigal Sunn]
Feel the pain of the ghetto through a teardrop
My peers stop and listen from eighteen years
Muslim and Christian We all face conviction
In this moment of oppression The world is like infection
On this block we confessin'
I use my mind as a weapon
Like I told my brothers Glock and Snub
Ain't No Half-Steppin' We gotta live Heaven
And watch our seeds taste the blessin'
I learned my lesson 'bout havin' snakes around my crew
Now I know the evil that men do and bitches too
We had thought by our riches
Some called thugs and snitches
Through the different timeframes
Kid, I watched crime change
In the time of fame
My man is like crack/cocaine
But through the black rain I seen many suffer in pain
We go for gain and pain
Now they rock some fat gold chains
Iced-out name perform a concert, sellin' out in Maine
Own the properties and all types of things
Some say the drug game and the music game is all the same

[Junior Reid]
Ooh.. Pray for the youths
Said me nah gon' cry.. Ooh-ooh-ooh..

[Hook line one only]

[Guru]
We can no longer put all the blame on the man
For those sellin' out I'm sayin', "Shame on the man"
For those fallin' victim I'm sayin', "Make a new plan"
And for those that need a way I'm sayin', "Take my hand"
See this mental slavery causes rash behavior, G
And I have to say for me that I wish it would all stop
Before we become extinct before we all drop
And R.I.P. to the rappers that's been slain
And R.I.P. to the fine young men who've lost their lives
I feel the pain
And do you know what it's like to lose a loved one?
It makes you numb
Especially when it's over somethin' small but ain't no fun
I lose four friends in one year I could feel
Them watchin' over me see their faces still
Some clear and some fear what's out there
For me I have no time to and may I remind you
This is a corrupted world of our design, du'
Peep my discussion no one can changes these things but us, son
We didn't ask for the liquor, crack and guns
We didn't ask for the poor eduction and lack of funds
But I know one thing none of us wanna die
But still we're Mashin' Up this World and I don't know why

[Hook line one only]

[Hook]

[Junior Reid]
Ooh.. Pray for the youths
Said me nah gon' cry.. Ooh-ooh-ooh..
Mom and Dad wipe the tears from ya eyes..
Ooh.. Pray for the youths
Said me nah gon' cry.. Ooh-ooh-ooh..
Ooh-ooh-ooh.. Riot in the prison
Rikers Island
When a gust of G-P-E Babylon will stand to see
So the sentence can't be free
Ooh-ooh-ooh.. Ooh.. Pray for the youths
Said me nah gon' cry.. Ooh-ooh-ooh..
Ooh-ooh-ooh..

("City streets don't have much pity") In New York, New York
("When you drown that's where you'll stay") New York nigga, uhh

I grew up on the New York crime side
Movin up like The Jeffersons, up in that highrise
Brownsville to Red Hook, I link with Ike Eyes
Call us gangsters, but we more like wiseguys
Before rap, I was hittin that block hard
Servin crack to the fiends, they was hittin that rock hard
Young nigga, that was coppin from uptown
Everything got shut down when your boy touched down
You can die real quick out here
Smokin a lot of piff and drinkin a lot of beer (word man)
Drug spots gettin raided by the dirty cops
You either gettin it poppin, or you gettin popped
Blinded by the facts, I make you see the truth
I can go back to the hood when I leave the booth
And I grind out until I'mma old man (yes sir)
You only get one shot, you never get a second chance (knahmean?)

[Outro: Don Bishop Agallah]
("It's survival in the city")
]In New York, New York
("When you live from day to day")
Where we from? That's right - New York, New York
("City streets don't have much pity")
Born and raised in New York, New York nigga
("When you drown that's where you'll stay")
Yo, yo, aiyyo[Verse 1: Jus ALLah]
I keep blunts of sess in between my jaws
I keep chunks of flesh, underneath my claws
Animal like, raping lady Afro-Dite
I watch people bleed to tease my appetite
Slice your mug, we're hand-and-knife thugs
That's so hardcore we banned from fightclub
Brawl with night crawling blood alcoholics
Y'all only hope is wooden stakes and garlic
Islamic, thinking on a higher logic
Dressed in arab garments on flying carpets
Taking me to hovering starships
With high powered aero nautics
To glide across cosmics
Lost in space, I pause to meditate
My soul's energy cause walls to shake
Niggas stand clear when my land is spread
Cause my scarecrow's got real Klansmen heads

[Verse 2: GZA/Genius]
I'm from the place where temples could flare, eagles are hurt
A neighbourhood wear from steady went to shirt
A battlefield setting the teams, they move thugly
A group with a bitter dispute that turned ugly
Beef that started back in elementary
Then it move from the block to the penetentiary
The contest of the phonecall was frightning
The spark from the blaze to kill all was lightning
Completely unaware of their surrounding
In a +pool of blood+ responsible for drownings
The un-informed remains a total darkness
The only time you see light is when this metal spark this set
Something greater than their own encounter
Took a small business and they killed the co-founder
Now police probe this youngster's background
Found something in his jeans that was hard to back down

[Verse 3: Jus Allah]
Yo, I release agression
Explode like automic weapon
Going to deep spells of demonic posession
Gave the devil my rhyme book, just to read through
He hid it in a safe that he had swallowed the keys to
Said:"Jus Allah, I have nothing to teach you"
There's no plauge or harm to man more deceitfull
Than a lost breed of evil
Fucking monsterous niggas
Trained to kill inside their subconcious
Taken what's promised, derived from skies and comets
Acomplish Prophecies from Muhammed
I overpower shit, fuck the hater and the doubter shit
Chop off the top of your skull, drink out of it
Cowardly bitch I hear death in the wind
Notify next of kin, best of friends
You limbs are lobbed off, by Jus Allah's axe
Forced to whack their own severed arms to catch[Verse 1]

[Hook] x2
You never was a killa; you never bust a gun
You never held the spot down; was never on the run
You never lived my life; you dead in the wrong
Cause you never did none of the shit that you said in your song

[Verse 2]
With the strength of a hundred baboons
I'll beat your eyes black as a fuckin' raccoon's
Leave you covered with stab wounds
Dead in a public bathroom
You like to tighten your face and cuss when you spit
Know what I noticed? That tough shit is just when you spit
I couldn't picture you bustin' a clip
I could see you suckin' a dick or probably getting fucked with a stick
Drama with me, son, your baby mama will be
Found in the woods, hangin' by her thong from a tree
You spit my life and won an award
But you can't get my stripes cause you the type to run in a war
Slung jums in front of the store; done it before
Held guns, I'm talkin' at least a hundred or more
Should put a gun to your jaw, to one of your whores
Fuck under the covers; we all lovers under the floor

[Hook]

Word is bond, word is bond
Abandoned Nation, we up in this bitch, nahmean, 2k
Niggas is outta jail, niggas is coming for niggas heads nahmean
All these fake ass MCs advocating real niggas lives and shit
Like it's some sweet sheet, nahmean?
Shit is, shit is, shit is aggravating god, word up man
Big up my nigga Shyne son, word up, hold your head man
I'ma make sure niggas take care of you up north son

You never was a killa, you never bust a gun
You never held the spot down, was never on the run
So why you wanna live fucked up like us?
If they convict J and Puff, good luck on RikersFrom the floor, keep it raw
Yeah, yo, yo, yo, yo

Verse 1: Dray, Skoob

I heard that one man's loss, is the next man's gain
I came to drop the shit like rain and bring the pain to your brain
We leave a stain, ain't prayin (why?), cos the game's for kids
It's diggity Das, no doubt, back to shatter your wigs
These pegs be all on my back, cats be actin too brave
I think they better just relax, before we dig em a grave
You blow the spot, baby face it, kids can't erase it
Or trace it, ya get'cha face lit, Books come lace it, what?

Bringin it straight from the lands of the crooks wit heat, Books to heat
Em
Keepin em raw from these Brooklyn streets, where Books defeats em
Flippin these lines like a polygraph, y'all niggas lolly gag
Freakin a style from Brooklyn, the home of the bodybags
And kids with no fear, bitches with no hair
Low gear Benz's wit chrome wears, what we all here
So don't stare, we there to interfere with the heads of ?????
What you didn't know, this miggity might hurt

Chorus:

It's diggy Das, raw breed
Make moves at top speed
It's the niggas from the sewer
Drink brew and puff weed
Giggity get wit it
Sewer rats stay twisted
Many people tell me this style is terrific
It's diggy Das, raw breed
Make moves at top speed
It's the niggas from the sewer
Drink brew and puff weed
Giggity get wit it
Sewer rats stay twisted
Aiyo, many people tell me this style is terrific

Verse 2: Dray, Skoob

Yo
Well yo, in Glocks we trust, and at the cops we bust
We just be hustlin for cash and makin lashes of muss
They went from AZ to Jay-Z, Nas back to Krayzie
To Drayzie, I fuck up your knot and then I'm swayze

Word, yeah, yo, yo
Well yo, figgity fuck a fear, wanna bust like a flare
Gun, beware, son, my sons keep guns in the air
None of y'all bitches can sue me, all my niggas twenty one gun salute me
Pick up the vine and rock the Kufi

Well, all I heard was Versucci, coochie for the lucci
The Gucci, but I just stay raw just like some sushi
My crew be ill, time to move these mill's
And all the drunken mawfuckers best to show they skills

Yeah, yo, yo
Well yo, the shit I talk, it be the shit I walk
Some faggots try to get wild, they bit my style but got caught
Like me and my man caught, slippin up at the crimescene
Fuckin lime green, you fuckin wart, this is my team

Chorus[Sean Price]
Yeah, we all cool, pa, anybody can get it
Winchester Remington's, any shotty I'll hit it
Yo, dress sloppy, but my rap is dapper
Watch Rosewood go outside and slap a cracker
Yo, various styles and, various hot shit
Killed a nigga on a train with Barry Slotnick, dude
Bottom line, you ain't ready for Ruck
Where your girl, duke, I'm ready to fuck
Do the knowledge, I'm ill
Especially when the god swallowing pills
Spaz out on your bitch while she gobble my dill
All my niggas went through drama, for real
Ruck dred, Agallah, body armor steel, squar from the ville
Untouchable, Sean Conner's got kill
Ya'll niggas chill before ya moma get killed, yo
Untouchable, Sean Conner's got kill
Ya'll niggas chill before ya moma get killed, yo

[Hook 2x: Agallah]
And we gon' give this all that we got
Blow the spot, keep rising to the top
All my niggas, keep rising to the top

[Agallah]
Everyone welcome to the gangsta world of Agallah
Where it's me and my niggas, my bitches, my guns and my cars
My dogs don't care, they'll kill these rap stars
I like ridin' around with a gangsta broad
I'mma gangsta dog, go with the shotty, or I'm shankin' y'all
Wind up in prison, no thanks to y'all
Come back to the block, then I break y'all balls
Get murked right on the spot, so we don't have to brawl
Listen up, pa, don't fuck with Agallah
None of these niggas could never see the catalog
I don't give a fuck if it's digital or analog
I flip, to any style, pa, press record
Give me a million, that's how you blessed the lord
Bullshit me? I won't even step to y'all
Consider the shit, this is what I left with y'all
Look at all the hot shit, that I kept from y'all

[Hook 2x]

[Hook: Agallah, Sean Price]
It's music in the air, a lots of loving everywhere
Everybody, gettin' right, everybody, gettin' right
It's smoke all in the air, everybody wanna share
Niggas is gettin' high, niggas is gettin' high

[Sean Price]
I love spittin raps and flows, I love gettin' stacks of dough
Like I love hittin' rats and hoes
I've been to club, where the stash is yo
Why you bumpin' me, god, actin' up in front of company, god
Got some shit up in the trunk of my car
We can fight right now, you get lumped in the bar
Bottom line duke; fuck who you are
Spit two gem stars out my mouth, give you a couple of scars

[Agallah]
The flame from Ruck and Agallah, and lendin' y'all spitly
We come through like this from Brooklyn, my niggas hopin' shitly
While niggas like Blick Street that be reppin' with me
My nigga Ike Eyes, yo I call him Ike Hitly
It's Agal-litly, featuring Sean Printly
We don't waste no time, we take care of this quickly
For real my nitly, it's about to get off the hitly
For shitly, you know where I'm at, my nigga, hit me
And God be with me, through the streets I move switfly
You want war, with a nigga, pa, then come and get me

[Hook 2x]

[Hook][Verse One] [Sean Price]:
First of all you bitch niggas actin' all fuckin' silly
Seein', ain't recognizin' how real this rap shit can really be
Fortified, Colt 45 like I'm Billy Dee
Pop you, you, and you for a killer's street trilogy
Sean Price nice with rhymes y'all not feelin' me
Till I slap niggas, now you feelin' me literally
Ayo, it'll be a cold day in Hell
Before you see Ruck, rather see O.J. in a cell
Type that'll run up on your block party
Jump off a dirt bike
Spit physical flames to the crowd, straight hurt mics
Ate the fuck out with this bitch cause her skirt tight
She ain't givin' up the fuckin' pussy, "When you turn dyke?"
Damn, snatched your chain cause I figure it's worth like
2, 3 hundred, gas money, hit the turnpike
Next thing I know helicopters and the searchlight
Damn gotta go, helicopters and the searchlight

[Verse Two] [Agallah]:
Ayo, I beat niggas till they bruise and they bleed with broken arms
Burn niggas
Till I hear the fuckin' sound of smoke alarms
Go to your crib ? the delivery and choke ya moms
I called 9-1-1 before I wrote this song
Killin' niggas, yo I'm doin' somethin' right outta wrong
.45 caliber nigga, yo I tote the long
None of y'all never see me and never do me nada
Jumpin' outta Impalas like niggas wildin' in Guatemala
With gats that holla
Iced out from the wrist the collar
Just image if I sold one of my discs for a dollar
The left hand on my dick, gun on my right
Son in the life, bullets across the street to his fleet
Put up a good fight
Shootouts for about an hour and a half
Alleyway before the L.I.Q. was the only escape path
Shoot through the air, Sha B and son count half
Beat the shit out ya ass
Take your jewels and your stash
We go home to the hood and try to spazz
Got you talkin' all that jazz
And your souls livin' in Alcatraz
I'll out ya ass
Kick bones out ya ass
And they won't know jack shit about ya ass
My flow will lie six feet deep in the grassYeah yeah, nine-seven, Das EFX
To your chin

Boondox, Hit Squad, PMD
Uhh

Chorus: repeat 4X

The PMD the mic's my only friend

Verse One:

Nuttin move but the green my team be on the shine
Shiggedy shine like a light, Hit Squad we keep it tight

Timberland boots, Rolex, with a Benz
Diggy Das EFX snap necks with PMD
Bringin the raw so you can see a b-boy is what I be
See I just can't resist this, cause Business is Business
So money mind your business, and shorty keep your distance
I did this once before, hardcore, forever in it
Tryin to win it, thank God for hip-hop, yo Scratch spin it

Chorus 1/2

Verse Two:

Yippie-yi-yay, yippy-yo, it's the, slow-flow mechanic
Mass confusion is crusin just start to panic

So to whom it may concern, from yours truly, no other
My style's butter, that's word to mother, underground gutter

Low budget, thought you was that nigga but you wasn't
Riggedy rough rugged and raw, straight from the floor
Fearless like the Four, Zsa Zsa like Gabor
Babe-Pah, we zonin up the hydro Squad by my side so
All my real heads keep it live represent

Chorus[Intro: DJ Kay Slay]
Aiyyo, the DJ Kay Slay the Drama King

For you bitch-ass niggas -- Let's GO!

[Agallah]
Swainy...Swoopy..
Oh my goodness, they ain't ready for this one man..
Yo, uh, I'm Clark Kent in the booth, I turn to Swoopyman
You damn right I fuck fans, call me groupie man
Propane is the clique, we get it loopy, DAMN!
Quiet on the set, action, I'm a movie MAN!
Ag the Don and Danny Swain
We the new Slick Rick and Daddy Kane, y'all niggas Danity Kane
Pass the champagne, I rep the campaign
I rep Propane, we gooed out, butane
I'm so insane, trained to rock stadiums
They tryna hang with the bars like gymnasiums
I tell you cats to hold ya heads like, craniums
Bullets can't stop the flow, it's titanium
Victory I'm tastin it, paper still chasin it
Top 5 I'm erasin 'em, anthrax I'm lacin 'em
Presidents I'm takin 'em, ragged up, I'm rakin 'em
Whole things I'm breakin 'em, shakedown I'm shakin 'em, CHEA!

[DJ Kay Slay]
Droppin that back-to-back heat at you lame-ass motherfuckers
You already KNOW what time it is
Kay Slay, Drama King, Street Sweepers!

[Danny!]
Thanks Kay Slay...Check it, I only roll with winners (WHAT?!) Never lames

Got them guns tucked, inside my penny loafers
(WHAAT?!)Mayne, it's D. Swain on the track
Got them goons on speed dial in case y'all niggas wanna scrap (scrap)
Don't let the frame fool ya (uh), I bus' a nigga's head (What?!)

Ladies and gentlemen, O-M-G

Straight outta Brooklyn, my former boss
Your friend and mine, El -- P!
{*cheers, screams, and applause*}

[El-P]
Yo Danny!
Yo, I need you to get the cab man
And uh, $15 plus tip

Happy to meet you (hey), limped here from a shattered town
Grew into a firefly, shinin where the shadows frown
Where other sinners sin, we limp in unison like cattle prowl
I'll legitimately signify how long those bastards howl
Point out to another man whose morgue had held the haggard down
I'll point you out a priest who'd never GREETS to Peter Pan and pals(That's impossible)
Wink wink, now that's an automatic party foul
Like cleanin out the bar with Bigfoot's tossed off sanitary towels
Shit, I'm not crying wolf until the moon is out
Duckin silver bullet kids and pull the flesh off grills and strips
What a zing, the plate of full clips sip gin and sping
Who glutted the wasted man, pull the trigger, click and grin
Better have ya floaties on, tighter than a gastric ring
I'll drown you and ya super peers, fill the baby pool with tears
I'll see you all in hell in flames, I'm chasin city money
Cyclone in a summer, ride my dick until you're sittin funny
