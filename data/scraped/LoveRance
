Leave a bitch screaming, now heâ€™s no joke
Call him "cocaine". Why? Heâ€™s so dope
And nevertheless, Iâ€™m with the best
And some of the best are all of the victims, too
That dick
And nevertheless niggas will stress
Talking the shit like I bet he wonâ€™t fuck my girl
Thatâ€™s a bet
The pussy fat like sumo
Beat the pussy up, now the bitch want a sumo
Better than me, who you know?
Just y'all, treat us, what you need me for?
I like grinding on the pussy
Peek under in the covers
Spying on the pussy
Head all in it, I got my mind on the pussy
Fuck ya in the dressing room, tryinâ€™ on the pussy

Even called a girlfriend over to try it
Now Iâ€™m beating up one, the other biting
I said Iâ€™m beating up one, the other biting

Dick suck, gotta leave if you donâ€™t
It wonâ€™t get hard if you wonâ€™t
I promise you, I know my dick
Iâ€™m beat it up across the room, across the floor
To your core, you want more
Your head hitting the door, your body aching and sore
Youâ€™re waving a white flag, I gotta declare war
I think your body is my enemy, yeah
But I believe I should love that enemy
I donâ€™t know what the hell got into me
Fuck what was, let me say what finna be
Ass smack her poo like ?weight? choking
Ass black and blue, like her booty out here locin'(what up cuz)
Too late night, Nelly has spoken

Poppin' rubber bands stunt in front your friends

Cover my eyes while they watching me
Turn around and dip it to the ground
Make it clap for me
Need a standing ovation, when I'm throwin currency
High right now, eyes burgundy
And your curvery is absurd to me
I got a touch and I got a feel
I gotta see that ass real
Cause if it is I'll take you home
Beat it up and I'll make you moan
DJ this her favourite song
This style she's been waiting on

Sweat the flow, slow it down
Speed it up, if you sing for the night ladies let me know what's up

Wobble baby, wobble baby, wobble for me
Uh, take a shot, lock and load, I love what I see
And if you lovin' what you feel,let me know that it's real
You keep bouncing on my dick, but you can bounce on my grill
Whatever you like I bite, you bouncing that ass jus' right

The way you wobble baby, makes me wanna' feel it
The way you keep talking that shit, makes me wanna' kill it
Uh, grind

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Hey! Beat that pussy up jab, jab, right hook
Send her home to her man let her watch that notebook
Shawty wanna hang on that coat hook (HAAAAAA!!!!)
Split that thang down the middle let her roll up
Sho' nuff gucci down to the shoelace
Hundred cash in the chain no fugaze
Ho still sweat a nigga on a cool day
Them other sucker niggas faker than a school day
A rich nigga gotta pay that's what you say
I got bitches from the Bay to the U.K
Thick with it pussy sweet like Kool Aid
Run it raw then I let her buss two straight
No suitcase on the PJ runway
Me plus two that's a G4 three way
Hey! I give her man a hard time
He got a soft six and I got a hard nine
HEY!

Money fame we want it all
To live life like weâ€™re movie stars
But not all stars show and most stars fall
She takes that pain away with alcohol
Swimming in that poison trying to drown her flaws
Still canâ€™t get a job put shes always given
No second chances
No soliciting when she is dancing
Call her hey mrs Jackson on a good day
Going Hamilton on and off day
No matter what she embrace the pain
Wash away her tears in the rain
Wouldnâ€™t you do the same 
Left astray and the only way for some change is more change than she can make to catch the subway to her interview do see if she can make that minimum wage
As an under paid slave for these savages in need of caves
Welcome to her cave the writings on the wall light up with neon and get brighter at the center stage
She slide down to put the fire out
They hose her down
She donâ€™t hear the music but she hear the sound
Of crying on the bed room floor
Her kid hungry and the only way to feed him
Is to sell sin in change for her freedom
She make more in a hour than the ones tipping made in full shifts
Its foolishness to think this life is bliss

(Verse 2)
But if she praying for a blessing she praying to repent
Because its hard out here when youâ€™re trying to pay the rent
Canâ€™t rely on a man who lies in his den to pretend
Then goes lying againâ€¦..
Itâ€™s a shame at least Brenda was brave
She threw it away
But she canâ€™t do the same
Already going to hell
Might as well not worsen the flames
Shoot I know what you saying that there is other ways
But thereâ€™s always statistics
And we always in it for the money
At the root of that evil we forget we living in Eden
Is this really land of the freedom?
When the eve of the day is a midnight fling
Its Barbie vs Aretha
She want that dolled up fever
But she just playing the game
But all is fair in love and war
The same for the business plan
So get money and more
Donâ€™t call her out her name
Sheâ€™s just another mother that needs to get food from the store
But itâ€™s a shame because its dogs at the door
