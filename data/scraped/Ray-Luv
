[ Chorus: Aaron Hall ]
I think I wanna get away
I think I wanna fly, fly away
Fly away
A nigga need to get away
I think I need to get high today
And fly away

[ VERSE 1: Ray Luv ]
Superfly, like a Indo weed and ecstacy high
I gotta get me some, muthafuckas losin they mind
Along with they life, everybody wantin to die
But scared to give in, God, can you teach a nigga to fly?
I'm tryin to get by, get high till I bust through the sky
But I'm stuck in the ghetto, for the life of me I can't tell you why
I'm losin focus, havin flashbacks of rats and roaches
And ripped sofas, no matter what, I'm gettin over
I be damned if I go back to that shit and livin sober
Still I feel the pain, so I pray for God to send a rainbow
Oh what a tangled web do we weave when we ( ? )
Get caught up in some shit we can't handle when in the mangle

[ Chorus (w/ad-libs) ]

[ VERSE 2: Ray Luv ]
Now what could take me higher than Hen, the weed or the gin
The greed or the sin, the grave or the pen - imagine
Peaceful days and nights full of passion with no blastin
Or everlastin repercussions of caskets and sadness
We need a new drug for the masses, Superfly
That won't cost me a dime when I'm jonesin to get high
No need for scissors, zig-zags or plastic bags
Niggas love the rush from the moment they take a drag
Better than cannabis, I know it's hard to believe
Closer to angel dust, impossible to conceive
Go 'head and take a puff, and then you know what I mean
Can't never get enough of the stuff that's servin the fiends
The herb of your dreams take you away from murderous themes
And leadin my team till the players land in honey and cream
The money's cool but won't help me when I struggle to breathe
All of us bleed, so all of us have a spiritual need

[ Chorus (w/ ad-libs) ]

[ VERSE 3: Ray Luv ]
I'm startin to peak, I finally found a worthy release
From all of my stress cause every day I battle the beast
And think about [Name] I wonder if he restin in peace
My son and my niece, I wonder if they'll ever be free
They say we should teach but will the people ever be reached
And finally see the value of the life that we breathe
All of us need, everybody got a hope and a dream
We plant em like seeds and pray to God they growin to trees
Battered and bruised, life will beat you down on your knees
You only lose if you snooze or you choose to retreat
I look inside me for answers tot he questions I seek
And swear when I speak, mobbin with the ( ? ) I keep
I reach for the moon, nobody's superflier than me
With my head in the clouds, happy, high as can be
Won't you come along with me
(Won't you come along with me)

[ Chorus (repeated w/ ad-libs) ]

[ Aaron Hall (repeated w/ ad-libs) ]
Get high with me
And fly away with me

[ Ray Luv ]
Yeah though
This song is dedicated to George Clinton
The man that said
Free yo mind and yo ass will follow
Remember that
We doin' it till 2000
The new millennium
Peace

[ Aaron Hall ]
Do you understand what he's sayin?
I'm talkin about within yourself
Baby
Oh yeah
Get the message
Oh yeah[Verse 1: Young Lay]
Cuddies perved by the corner, stout, herb
Got me twisted, mo' cold killin' murders
Them brothers gettin' further
Got my pencil for utensil, this'll keep they mind knownin
Spot some thugs at the club, and they got the nines showin
Dirty pimpin g's, one of my dreams, player now listen
Lotta blacks locked down, but comin back around in '96
All the gals my six (what else?) my track crew and my mother
Make these police wonder: how is he so undercover?
Never been a lover, but America had broke my heart
I was told to tear up out this before this tear me apart
Eat through scrap, black tracks, free milk and cheese
While the Japs stack scratch with the Vietnamese
But I'm finna' squeeze, stack G'z they left on a trap
A young playa mack, hit the bud', spit a rap
It's just that feelin, that feelin that I have for children
Are able to love us, but these crazy devils try to kill us

[Hook:]
I gotta survive, I try to stay alive, ho
Smokin that dank to deal with the pain

(My nigga Ray Luv, when'd you get up out the pen, man?)

[Verse 2: Ray Luv]
June 2nd '93 I returned to the streets
Did 2 months in the county and I opt to the beat
Now the cops keep watch, cause they know that I rap
Tell the world that I'm a gangsta, cause I ride with a strap
But I ain't yo gangsta, just a young nigga caught up in the struggle
Born hustler, goin' for the jugular
Out to take the beast down, piece down might be too late
The funk is on, high, drunk off Thunderbird and Grape Kool-Aid
Would love to catch a playa slippin', take me down and book me
Guilty as charged, hit the switch and try to cook me
Silence a nigga for the shit I'm spittin, I know I'm scarin' ya
A poison you created in the veins of America
Mis-educated, incarcerated, institutionalized
That 3rd strike will have a gang of them rollers dyin'
Ain't no love where I'm goin', no love where I'm comin' from
Remember me, that real-ass nigga you been runnin' from
Got us sprung off the cocaine and the welfare
While the black babies die without health care

[Hook:]
I gotta survive, I try to stay alive, ho
Smokin' that dank to deal with the pain

[Verse 3: Mac Mall]
Now how could I pledge allegiance to a racist-ass flag
When the rollers at my do' with a .44 mag?
Got my mother spittin' drag 'bout I ain't home
Got a double homicide warrant on my dome
I hear em pushin in the do', I grab my Mac with two clips
Cut through the back window and like a g hit a fence
I'm thinkin' 'bout my folks gettin' sent for violation
Foes and punk police, them devils still at my do'
I peep a group of ten tryina' get information
I threw the clips in the Mac, start lettin' off frustration
It's better than incarceration any day, we gonn' die anyway
So if I go out blastin', call it my fate
I got niggas' in the pen like my cousin Bud
Lunatic Insane, and my partner T-Love
Big Tom, Ray Ray, Kilo Cutt, Mac Dre
Cleek, Jamal, Jinx and Bluebonic, man

[Hook:]
I gotta survive, I try to stay alive, ho
Smokin' that dank to deal with the pain

[Verse 4: 2Pac]
Now I been called a crook, a killer, a thug
A no-good dealer of drugs
And Blood or Cuz, doesn't matter what set you was
Cause where I'm at, if you black, we strapped
As long as ki's make g's these thieves attack
And ain't no rules on the streets these days
Muthafuckas' better watch they back and take it eazay'
I'm livin in the dangerzone
And learnin' lesson from the game, it's on
Niggas' was gone when the frame was on
I'm gettin breakin' them balls daily
Is there a ghetto in heaven or do I go to hell?
See, seems I was sentenced to death, takin my steps with my head down
While pour I liquor for my niggas', cause they dead now
My memory since I was a little seed
Was a penitentiary full of niggas' like me
These cops can't terrorize us, they despise us
Niggas, cause we on the rise
Plus everybody's searchin' for a piece of the truth
And the youth turn the streets into a piece of Beirut
And the truth is

[Hook:]
I gotta survive, I try to stay alive, ho
Smokin' that dank to deal with the pain[intro]
[Ray Luv]
Yiddo, Yiddo, ha ha ha ha, this yo' nigga Young Ray Luv
Back in yo' motherfucking face, you know?
Ha ha ha ha, the Lynk Crew, no more trouble, just trying to bubble
And this goes out to my son - Baby IE, wassup boy?

I was a hustlin-ass nigga straight lovin' the game
Always meant to be a playa put the Luv in my name
Who put the hustle in this youngster? I guess my daddy's to blame
Coz if it made skrilla, there wasn't no shame in his game
Another young playa, caught up in the fortune and fame
Nigga when I'm gone, will they still remember my name?
Straight soldier, stayed at this here 'till it's over
Old folks laughing, telling my daddy that I'm never sober
Why don't you understand I'm just trying to feed my baby?
I'm going crazy, none of y'all fools can fade me
You trying to save me? Sometimes I feel the love is gone
There I go, out the door to get my hustle on
Dreams of platinum, rap after rap I'm writing back to back
While I hustle stack for stack
I'm caught in the cross, the game twist me into trouble
Forever hustle, I'mma struggle 'till I bubble

Gotta make my money double
Struggle out of trouble, all good
I'mma hustle till I bubble
Gotta make my money triple
Hennessy not ripple
(Big Eddie Spaghetti you gone pop like a pimple)

BG turned OG, gone off that oldie
Went from Zenith's and Vogue's to Lexus I's and gold D's
In love with the game, will I fold G's?
Ain't no tears just beer poured for my homies
A ghetto star, every hood in church know me
Haters want me but trick them suckers long as the set got love for me
I'm Lynked up to the fullest
So you better think nine times before you come at me with some bullshit
The Feds is crackin' down like bullwhips
And niggas' gunnin' for me so when I smoke I keep a full clip
I just wanna get richer
So when you look at success I'm the nigga you seeing in the picture
The B-I-G E-Double-D-I-E Spaghetti
You know me already, nigga with the long fetti
Gangbangin' but never see me with no rag
No time to lag, stuffin' hundreds into Hefty bags
The local motors wanna' battle
I'm gone holler "trump", cause inflation
Move the organization to Seattle
Call my up-North connection
He say, "I got it sewed up in Seattle
Even judges in the next election"
I have a ticket to a Samsonite
Ready to get it on, fool I'm gone on the next flight
A young nigga out to rumble
Got to get my money on, nigga watch my bubble

Gotta make my money double
Struggle out of trouble, all good
I'mma hustle till I bubble
Gotta make my money triple
Hennessy not ripple
(Big Eddie Spaghetti you gone pop like a pimple)

[Young Dre]
My chances gettin' slim in the wind as I'm hustlin'
Straight automatic phone call sidin' in traffic so I'm dumpin'
Coz' all I really wanted was a piece of the ree-zor
I bust so heavy in this geed-ame, I can't ever skeezers out on the grind
Heard 'em motivated poppilin' bubblin' major
Just 19 years old I'm freezing cold fiending for paper
You ain't know I'm a young BG from the 'Tay soakin' game from my older cousin
Convinced to grind 'till I'm ballin, you thought I wasn't
Trying to keep my focus with the daily bomb, better get the Loc'ses
For the chronic got more straight keeps my calm
Flick of the wrist, we get the dopest Coca-Cola
So do the gypsy-twister hocus-pocus A1-Yola
Tear in to any fool thats trying to stop my hustle
It'll be a 211-187 Young Dre is destined to bubble

Gotta make my money double
Struggle out of trouble, all good
I'mma hustle till I bubble
Gotta make my money triple
Hennessy not ripple
(Big Eddie Spaghetti you gone pop like a pimple)

[Ray Luv]
So much fetti I'm feeling hunted
Every epsiode I be lookin' for my face on the Most Wanted
Feel like my life was written by Donald Gould
A kingpin on the run, nigga, like Jesse Owens
Never knowin' which one of these suckers calling themselves a menace
Gonna be pumped off that spinach wanna put a hot-one in a
Young nigga, my grandmomma call me sinner
Look, granny, I just want to make you proud of me and be a winner
Get out of this shit before I'm fade out, doin' bad
Go legit before I'm layed out, on the slab
Who say we can't be hard, and still smart?
Who say I gotta go out to the pen or the county morgue?
Gotta find a way out, my little homies they be rappin'
Me and my mail, let's see what we can make happen
Get in it to win it and pop like Russel Simmons before I finish
A big baller, going out to the book of Guiness
But these playa-haters known to be snitches and traitors
Fool you can't fade us, fuckin' with Big Eddie yes the greatest
Little homies keep writing I'm gonna put five grand on a lawyer
Big Eddie Records got a business license
Rumor has it that my young niggas out there jackin'
Oh, you ain't know? I signed them soldiers now we goin' platinum
I found my route up out the trouble
Out to get my money on, nigga watch my bubble

Gotta make my money double
Struggle out of trouble, all good
I'mma hustle till I bubble
Gotta make my money triple
Hennessy not ripple
(Big Eddie Spaghetti you gone pop like a pimple)

Vogues with the gold stripe
Folding bank roll from the hole in my windpipe

Representin once again L-C to the end
Young hustlas international crack smugglers
Game jugglers
North Bay ballin bubblers
Brother the game gets sticky like a Zig-Zag
Tricky player in fact
It's hard to keep it intact
At times you might think you gonna lose your mind
Just push rewind and soak the game up out of every line
And you gone find a young soldier back against the wall
In the game makin mail off of all of yall

(repeat till end)1987 I was all in watching my O-Gs out there ballin
Yes yes y'all it was on like a light switch
Niggas was getting rich, the game was getting thick
88-89, still was spectating soaking up game
Gettin laced and watchin all the playa-hatin
Right about now I'm on my own, 17 and grown
Time for me to get my motherfucking hustle on
1991 I hit the track for myself me and Andy
I was writing raps he was grinding on that candy
Tash was rhyming, it dont matter it was hell
To make a little mail, to make a lotta bail
Possession for sales was the case
Many caught em, hubba rock was the shit
Thats why so many fiends bought em
Sprung off that ice cream
Living they life on the pipe dream
But we wasn't trippin
Had to be about our lean, right?
I stole the same fool's load almost every night
Just a part of the game carjacker
Out to get my money on the motherfucking factor, nigga

1991 my nigga Likky-Los took me to his rappin folks
On the north pole side of Valle-Jo
I left the cook-up got the hookup from my nigga Drizzze
Been on since 92 a nigga stay about his pizzzay
Hustler-Hatin-Hoes be on the lookout for him when you see him
Hide up at the cookout act like you don't know him
Coz a young broad to me ain't nothin but a record sale
Young and so sprung but got a nigga makin hella mail
But dont get it twisted my game is a department
Poppin outta control gettin swoll fuckin movie stars
And it was on like that for the 92
But I never knew the dirty shit that a bitch'll do
Set a nigga up for the jack-a-mack
Musta been a crack attack
Roll and slam me down like the motherfucking Shaq Attack
Gotta get this groupie back
Musta been that hootie mack
That would make this hoochie rap
Wanna get my money stacked
Thats why you gets no love in fact
You could get a slug for that
Gone without no get it back
Yo this fucker's trying to jack
So you just a jack-a-ho
Niggas love to mack-a-ho
She could be a sack of hoes but she ain't no factor though
Yeauh, bitch, ha ha

1995 this game's for all of y'all
While I'm back from the clink and I'm ballin y'all
Young Ray, the nigga of the niggas want to be like me
A G like me
But they can't see me in the diggy-dark
I'm creepin' through the piggy-park
Undercover cop try to watch from a Skylark
Read him like a sex book, out to get an ex-crook
I left his ass shook, gone by the next look
You'll never get your jack on
Get to slip some crack on Ray and do me hard
Better dress warm
Coz I got several attourneys on my payroll
I hope you like the cold you'll be working at the North Pole
Huh, it's kind of simple when I pop like a pimple
Drink Hennesse not ripple and watch my money triple
At night I be kickin, up a tree stickin
Coz my tape's on hit like barbeque chicken
Got your girlfriend geekin
Y'all ain't even speakin coz you heard
She was freakin with the Lynk last weekend
Ran through 92 mobbin' like a tractor
Stayed a G in 93 and 95 the motherfucking factor, nigga, yeauh

[outro]
Nizine Fizour, yeah real that's Young Ray
They don't feel me though, whoooo-hooo
And that's real
Mac Mall!
Yiddo I'm still the factor baby
Even though your boy can't make it to LA on this one man
You know? But it's all good, wassup?! Yeah!
Where them Lynk niggas at man?
You know? Ha ha ha ha, you a fool, aaaah
Say that man, you know? Yeah
This one goes out the L-O-motherfucking-S
Who had me touchin down in 1991 in the V
And put your boy on the map like this here
This one's for you, baby boyeeeDrop that mang, drop that
Yiddo
For the 1-99-5 ha ha
Last night
Yiddo

Last night
Something about the sky being overcast
And the doja had me thinkin about times past
Let me see, when was it all cool?
April 15th, 1972
That's when Izza gave birth to me
And life gave the whole damn Earth to me
And everything was a struggle
Coz life ain't nathan but a hustle
I guess you could say I was raised on good rhymes
Corned rows, collared greens and episodes of Good Times
In the ghetto was the place to be for me
My moms yellin coz I'm never where I'm supposed to be
Out hanging with the big kids
When I shoulda stayed home like the rest of the tricks did
Coz an ass whuppin was vicious
But nowadays playa thats the things that I miss
Hanging out at the candy store after school
Waiting on the route 5 bus trying to be cool
Once in it's on to the back
To get your clown on with the rest of the baby macks
Guess it was then my love for music came about
Coz Earth Wind and Fire was gettin much play at my house
Take a blast to the past, right?
The dank took me there last night

[Hook]
[BG vocalist]
Last night I lay in my bed (it don't quit y'all)
I took a trip on the other side (it don't quit y'all)
And I seen things I haven't seen (it don't quit y'all)
In a very very long time
Ah, ah, ah

Saturday afternoon
I'm on my way to the barbeque
Don't act twelve because it's only 2 [?]
Ain't seen most of my homies in ages
Now they all married and run around with babies
But it still feels real good
Coz back in the day we used to run our neighborhood
Snuck in the city pool
Ran around like a gang of fools
Lunch time, cut school
Head straight to the mall where the game's played
And I'd hook up with my crew at the arcade
Leanin on the wall, broke, took my first smoke
Of a Newport and I damn near choked
My ganddaddy used to tell me about the old days
Right before he passed away
When everybody kept they doors unlocked
And a neighborhood fight didn't mean getting shot
Broke as hell but really didn't matter about Christmas time
Coz they did what they had to to get me mine
I knew right then I had to find a way to
Get my money on coz I wanted to be a playa
At night I used to sneak on the late creep
Out my room window when mom and pops was asleep
On my way to go kick it
The days of a young G oh how I miss it
Coming up was my daydream
And to wear gold braids like my man on the A-Team
I looked deep into my past life
The dank took me there last night

It don't quit y'all (repeat through chorus)

[Hook]

Let's take a trip to the lake if you will
Shine up the gold ones I got a little time to kill
Hear the sounds of a dog bark
And it brings back the memories of days in the South Park
A few of the homies I grew up around
Is in the ground
Or locked down I guess that's why they don't come around
But I'll never let it kill me
Coz things are gonna get a little bit... (easier) feel me?
Early on in the game we was struggling
Rappin till I come up, full time hustling
But things done changed around this way
Lounge all day with some dank and Tangueray
Let's hit the freeway homie
Coz I just got my 350 tighted up an OB
Hit 580 like we used to
Back in '89 activators by the Juice Crew
I keep in touch just as much as I age
When I travel still reached by the beeps of my Skypager
Take a look to the past, fight
Yo Grimm we smoked about a quarter pound... [Mr Grimm] (last night, ha ha ha!)

It don't quit y'all (repeat until fade)

[Hook until fade]I bounced out the house about a quarter to three
I grabbed my cellular phone, some bumblebee from M-D's
Playa-haters on the block, it don't matter to me
I make G's they all recognize the P
Popped in that B.I.G. coz "it was all a dream"
All a scheme to run with the ballin' team
I run through money like a counting machine
Stay clean in the collar, might whip up outtie in a Saleen
Sip that Hennessy from here to Tennessee
And anywhere in between, got Lynk Crew on the scene
Bet they got true playas in all the states
But it's that Bay Area brother from the ballin' state
I been a hustlin-ass soldier since 83, wait and see
Old school partners they'll be hating me
Playa-haters lay awake to "Creep" like TLC
Straight up, "I Saw it Coming" like EPMD
Let's hear it for the cream, the triple-beam and the whole ball team
Paper-chase by all means
All these nationwide ballers they be callin' me, mang
Got them stories for sale, I'm in the game, boy

In the game (I'm in the game, boy!)
In the game, makin' mail
In the game (I'm in the game, boy!)
In the game with stories for sale (with them stories for sale)
(repeat)

Pay me a visit to Valle-Jo and even though I'm not from there
I got partners that recognize a Lynk Crew playa
A ghetto star, cleaner than the Board of Health
With a radar you still couldn't see me like Stealth
So I'm out to the bone, I knew him from the "Money On" days [?]
He used to clown but tell me, "be about your money always"
Wattup killer? Why you ain't hollered at me?
Had to move up, no more Towallamie Street
What you know? I went from hustlin' to having it major
Puffin' bumblebee and reminiscing life on the razor
Used to look like only hard times was comin' my way
Now it's hard rhymes and Alize everyday
It's pimpin', I had to finally lay my cards on the table
You ain't mackin' unless you got nine more in your stable
No more jail, double-digits, thousands on bail
In the game, makin' mail, got my stories for sale

In the game (I'm in the game, boy!)
In the game, makin' mail
In the game (I'm in the game, boy!)
In the game with stories for sale (with them stories for sale)
(repeat)

1-9 to the 9-5 I'm in the game like EA Sports
In it 'till I'm finished to win it and I'll never fall short
On the ball, calling the game, mang, having things well
Player campaigning from the Bay to the A-T-L
Say we bail to a mid party, sidin' the Vette
Bet I'll have you going buck wild, drippin' in sweat
Cause the kid got 'nuff styles, give me much respect
They call me, "Airtight Eddie" the game is tough to check
I think back on how it used to be struggling for green
Had to juggle between hustlin' and living my dream
Bustin' raps in the bathroom, dreaming 'bout wealth
Can't nobody give it to me, gots to make it myself
So now who put this together? Nigga, me, that's who
Who do I trust? Who? Not you if it ain't Lynk Crew
A young troop doing it for my soldiers in jail
In the game, stackin' mail, got my stories for sale

In the game (I'm in the game, boy!)
In the game, makin' mail
In the game (I'm in the game, boy!)
In the game with stories for sale (with them stories for sale)
(repeat)

[outro]
Yiddo yiddo
The game gets thick on that you can bet
A real true to the game playa for sho' gone stack chips
Ha ha ha, yiddo
That's why I continue to represent
And fo' sho' get all the wealth I can get
Till my dyin' day I remain a Lynk Crew soldier
And it's Young Ray Luv for the 1-99-5, represent
Playa' campaigning all year, ha ha, you know?
An' I'm out

[OG#1] (deep inhale) I'mma tell you right now
[OG#2] Wuzzat?

[OG#2] Hurry the fuck up!

[OG#2] Yeah, was cool
[OG#1] But a motherfucker don't want to hear all that ol' heeby shit
[OG#2] Fuck nah!"Here's a little story I got to tell"	(Beastie Boys)

Straight from the streets and the alleys of Cali, mo'
Hits and bits from the dephts of the Vallejo
The highs to mids, here's a kid from the Rosetown
Nigga Ray Luv is at this with the dope sound
(Here to tell you a tale about a man and his money)
Young brother straight broke, ain't a damn thing funny
Girlies had stripes, Dickey slacks is how the macks stroll
Gold when he flex, his Rolex when he roll
Oh, damn how I wanted to live large
Private jet lease when Ray Luv is in charge
Hard is how I live my life
Thank God I never smoked the pipe
I need money, streets can't last me
And keep a eye out for brothers tryina blast, G
And in the past I never planned on seein the pen
It was a place I knew I never wanted to be in, my friend
I'ma clock, I knew it down deep in my heart
Hoes jock, I'ma do it cuz I'm down from the start
I'm serious 'bout mine, more than just the same ol' song
Cuz I'm in there, and I'm out to get my money on

(Check this out)

1991 - the year Ray changed up
1992 - the year Ray Luv came up
I been around, now I'm headed to the top brand
Knowledge from Jah (right) ????????
Anyway, back to my temple of my hustle
If you ain't got no clout or grip you ain't got no muscle
I do not be the one, call me Mr. Assed-Out
Niggas planned to do me so I packed em and mashed out
Grandma's tryin to keep me out the streets cuz they after me
But she don't understand where I'm at, see
You know, I pack a pistol when I aim to out-run 'em
And if they pull a ho move I won't hesitate to gun 'em
God damn, I'm mo' broke than I ever been
Rock bottom through with me cuz it's a place I've never been
My ace boon's locked up in a jail do'
Now my gat's got my back while I get my mail on
Daily I get calls from the P.D
Around the clock jockin, that Santa Rosa police
Real about my motive, it's the same ol' song
Cuz I'm in there, and I'm out to get my money on

Now in '93, black, a mack upon the scene
They know me in the Bay, now nationwide I'm stackin green
Cash m-o-n-e-y, just wanted to make it
Never really had much but always used to fake it
Hung with the boys slingin d, but no time fo' it
God had graced a plan for me and now in 1992 I know it
Police don't respect me: "Why you gots a pager
Where did you get this money, Mr. Young Black Teenager?"
Got it from your daughter, she came to my concert
Makin my record platinum, wearin a Ray Luv t-shirt
Blame somebody, blame yourself
Cuz you give her the money and she give it to somebody else
Me - now it's in my bank account
So Mr. Five-o, here's somethin to think about
And to you brothers, you used to talk drag when they see me
Now you wanna be me on 'MTV
Raps', the young black mack with the video
Kick it with the boys from the Rose, but you don't hear me though
On West 9th I began to strive
But I learned to be a playa in the 415
I used to dream of C.C.'s and Impalas
Now I want a Benz and ends to spend dollars

Yeah
Cuz I'm out to get my money on

Yo, what's up
This is Ray Luv in the house
Check this out, baby boy
This shout out goes out to all the playas in the whole Bay Area
All the Richmond playas

All the Frisco playas

All the Santa Rosa playas
All the Moreno City playas
All the Vallejo playas
All the Sacramento playas
And all the playas in the whole world
Yo, check this out, mayn

Y'all better get yo money on, mayn!

(Ha-ha, he gets his money on)

And last but not least
Much love to all the young black brothers
Tryina come up in 1992 and check a grip
(Nuff respect!)
It ain't about jackin, it's about mackin the system
And gettin what you got comin to you[Verse 1: Young Lay]
Cuddies perved by the corner, stout, herb
Got me twisted, mo' cold killin' murders
Them brothers gettin' further
Got my pencil for utensil, this'll keep they mind knownin
Spot some thugs at the club, and they got the nines showin
Dirty pimpin g's, one of my dreams, player now listen
Lotta blacks locked down, but comin back around in '96
All the gals my six (what else?) my track crew and my mother
Make these police wonder: how is he so undercover?
Never been a lover, but America had broke my heart
I was told to tear up out this before this tear me apart
Eat through scrap, black tracks, free milk and cheese
While the Japs stack scratch with the Vietnamese
But I'm finna' squeeze, stack G'z they left on a trap
A young playa mack, hit the bud', spit a rap
It's just that feelin, that feelin that I have for children
Are able to love us, but these crazy devils try to kill us

[Hook:]
I gotta survive, I try to stay alive, ho
Smokin that dank to deal with the pain

(My nigga Ray Luv, when'd you get up out the pen, man?)

[Verse 2: Ray Luv]
June 2nd '93 I returned to the streets
Did 2 months in the county and I opt to the beat
Now the cops keep watch, cause they know that I rap
Tell the world that I'm a gangsta, cause I ride with a strap
But I ain't yo gangsta, just a young nigga caught up in the struggle
Born hustler, goin' for the jugular
Out to take the beast down, piece down might be too late
The funk is on, high, drunk off Thunderbird and Grape Kool-Aid
Would love to catch a playa slippin', take me down and book me
Guilty as charged, hit the switch and try to cook me
Silence a nigga for the shit I'm spittin, I know I'm scarin' ya
A poison you created in the veins of America
Mis-educated, incarcerated, institutionalized
That 3rd strike will have a gang of them rollers dyin'
Ain't no love where I'm goin', no love where I'm comin' from
Remember me, that real-ass nigga you been runnin' from
Got us sprung off the cocaine and the welfare
While the black babies die without health care

[Hook:]
I gotta survive, I try to stay alive, ho
Smokin' that dank to deal with the pain

[Verse 3: Mac Mall]
Now how could I pledge allegiance to a racist-ass flag
When the rollers at my do' with a .44 mag?
Got my mother spittin' drag 'bout I ain't home
Got a double homicide warrant on my dome
I hear em pushin in the do', I grab my Mac with two clips
Cut through the back window and like a g hit a fence
I'm thinkin' 'bout my folks gettin' sent for violation
Foes and punk police, them devils still at my do'
I peep a group of ten tryina' get information
I threw the clips in the Mac, start lettin' off frustration
It's better than incarceration any day, we gonn' die anyway
So if I go out blastin', call it my fate
I got niggas' in the pen like my cousin Bud
Lunatic Insane, and my partner T-Love
Big Tom, Ray Ray, Kilo Cutt, Mac Dre
Cleek, Jamal, Jinx and Bluebonic, man

[Hook:]
I gotta survive, I try to stay alive, ho
Smokin' that dank to deal with the pain

[Verse 4: 2Pac]
Now I been called a crook, a killer, a thug
A no-good dealer of drugs
And Blood or Cuz, doesn't matter what set you was
Cause where I'm at, if you black, we strapped
As long as ki's make g's these thieves attack
And ain't no rules on the streets these days
Muthafuckas' better watch they back and take it eazay'
I'm livin in the dangerzone
And learnin' lesson from the game, it's on
Niggas' was gone when the frame was on
I'm gettin breakin' them balls daily
Is there a ghetto in heaven or do I go to hell?
See, seems I was sentenced to death, takin my steps with my head down
While pour I liquor for my niggas', cause they dead now
My memory since I was a little seed
Was a penitentiary full of niggas' like me
These cops can't terrorize us, they despise us
Niggas, cause we on the rise
Plus everybody's searchin' for a piece of the truth
And the youth turn the streets into a piece of Beirut
And the truth is

[Hook:]
I gotta survive, I try to stay alive, ho
Smokin' that dank to deal with the painDrop that mang, drop that
Yiddo
For the 1-99-5 ha ha
Last night
Yiddo

Last night
Something about the sky being overcast
And the doja had me thinkin about times past
Let me see, when was it all cool?
April 15th, 1972
That's when Izza gave birth to me
And life gave the whole damn Earth to me
And everything was a struggle
Coz life ain't nathan but a hustle
I guess you could say I was raised on good rhymes
Corned rows, collared greens and episodes of Good Times
In the ghetto was the place to be for me
My moms yellin coz I'm never where I'm supposed to be
Out hanging with the big kids
When I shoulda stayed home like the rest of the tricks did
Coz an ass whuppin was vicious
But nowadays playa thats the things that I miss
Hanging out at the candy store after school
Waiting on the route 5 bus trying to be cool
Once in it's on to the back
To get your clown on with the rest of the baby macks
Guess it was then my love for music came about
Coz Earth Wind and Fire was gettin much play at my house
Take a blast to the past, right?
The dank took me there last night

[Hook]
[BG vocalist]
Last night I lay in my bed (it don't quit y'all)
I took a trip on the other side (it don't quit y'all)
And I seen things I haven't seen (it don't quit y'all)
In a very very long time
Ah, ah, ah

Saturday afternoon
I'm on my way to the barbeque
Don't act twelve because it's only 2 [?]
Ain't seen most of my homies in ages
Now they all married and run around with babies
But it still feels real good
Coz back in the day we used to run our neighborhood
Snuck in the city pool
Ran around like a gang of fools
Lunch time, cut school
Head straight to the mall where the game's played
And I'd hook up with my crew at the arcade
Leanin on the wall, broke, took my first smoke
Of a Newport and I damn near choked
My ganddaddy used to tell me about the old days
Right before he passed away
When everybody kept they doors unlocked
And a neighborhood fight didn't mean getting shot
Broke as hell but really didn't matter about Christmas time
Coz they did what they had to to get me mine
I knew right then I had to find a way to
Get my money on coz I wanted to be a playa
At night I used to sneak on the late creep
Out my room window when mom and pops was asleep
On my way to go kick it
The days of a young G oh how I miss it
Coming up was my daydream
And to wear gold braids like my man on the A-Team
I looked deep into my past life
The dank took me there last night

It don't quit y'all (repeat through chorus)

[Hook]

Let's take a trip to the lake if you will
Shine up the gold ones I got a little time to kill
Hear the sounds of a dog bark
And it brings back the memories of days in the South Park
A few of the homies I grew up around
Is in the ground
Or locked down I guess that's why they don't come around
But I'll never let it kill me
Coz things are gonna get a little bit... (easier) feel me?
Early on in the game we was struggling
Rappin till I come up, full time hustling
But things done changed around this way
Lounge all day with some dank and Tangueray
Let's hit the freeway homie
Coz I just got my 350 tighted up an OB
Hit 580 like we used to
Back in '89 activators by the Juice Crew
I keep in touch just as much as I age
When I travel still reached by the beeps of my Skypager
Take a look to the past, fight
Yo Grimm we smoked about a quarter pound... [Mr Grimm] (last night, ha ha ha!)

It don't quit y'all (repeat until fade)

[Hook until fade][Intro: Too Short]
Send a shout out to the homie Pac
Know you out there somewhere right now writing rhymes man, laying tracks
Straight love, you know what I'm saying always man
We had never forgot about 2Pac, you know, that's our boy till the end

From hood to hood, block to block
The Bay always got love for 2Pac
From hood to hood, block to block
The Bay always got love for 2Pac

[Verse 1: E-40]
Ooh, pimp game impecable
Work game incredible (how many songs did he do)
Nine songs a day, no less than four
A rap legend, an icon, a reptible
Last time I seen him was at my Rapper's Ball video
Pac you'll be proud of me pimpin', I'm doing my best
Not only the Bay, but I'm holding down the West
And I just wanna thank Afeni (why)
For birthing 2Pac Shakur, the greatest rapper in history

[Verse 2: MC Hammer]
I'm glad we had a chance, to say goodbye
I shed so many tears and you changed my life
California Love baby ride or die
I can hear you, right now, Pac yelling West Side
And West it is, we got the world going dumb
We gone make 'em understand Pac where we coming from
Don't you worry homie, rest in peace
We appreciate your love, let your soul run free

[Verse 3: San Quinn]
Look into the hearts of men, every pumping valve
Man I wish we had 2Pacalypse now
Like you, I wanna make the whole world love me
You let me know, only God can judge me
I got tears in my eyes as I write this verse
The whole Bay know you were hyphy first
You've been gone, we gon stand strong
Immortalized, the legend lives on

[Chorus: Mike Marshall]
Do you hear the people sing, singing the songs that's in their veins
It's the music of a people who have smiled and found the pain
With the beating of your heart, there goes the beating of the drums
Know the song continues on when tomorrow comes

[Verse 4: Mistah Fab]
This is for the great Amaru
God knew, that you, would ride through the ghettos of the world and provide food
For hopeless youth, dope feinds with dope to use
The way that you spoke your views gave hope to dudes
2Pac, the legendary Shakur
Makaveli the Don, a prophet I'm sure
And '96 man it dont seem like it's been
I can picture you rolling up in your 500 Benz

[Verse 5: Mac Mall]
You gave me love on the ghetto scene
Put me on a million TV screens, with you
I remember drinking liqour at century clubs
Watching superstars sworn over Thug Life
You took a youngin from the Crest Side world wide
Real thizzness, I was family when you died
I'm a real outlaw and I'mma ride til the end of time
And when I see you on the other side
I crack the cap on the Henny
And Big Back, would I lie?

[Verse 6: Band-Aide of Dem Hoodstarz]
All eyes on me, dear mama, its me against the world
You know I get around like your brendas little girl
Blast me, no im not telling you the blasphemy
Pac was a [?], his death was a tragedy

[Verse 7: Scoot of Dem Hoodstarz]
Come with me, hail mary to the soldiers
Spit at the cameras, flipping off the rollers
I swear you made a nation full of thugs, put your W's up
And make the West Coast feel like one, rest in peace Pac

[Chorus: Jimmie Reign, Meilani]

[Verse 8: Turf Talk]
(Aye Pac wassup mayne)
Man I've been missing Makaveli since '96
Pac the games change, there are hella wimps
Picrture Me Rolling, one of my favorite songs
Satrin At The World Through My Rearview, Life Goes On
Had dreams of working with you, but it never happened
But I ain't trippin, we'll collaborate some day in heaven
All your albums classics, all of them slapping
Is there a heaven for a G, I know you got it cracking

[Verse 9: Lil Uno of The Pack]
Makaveli, 2Pac, he was a legend
But he in a better place, on earth we call it heaven
'96 is the year that we lost a gift
You gone, but not forgotten, and you always will be missed

[Verse 10: Lil B of The Pack]
Man, Pac, we love you, ain't nobody above you
You music touched us, and the people we buzzing
It's all about Pac, yeah the angel with the broken wings
Rose from concrete, he's still here is what it seems

[Verse 11: Young L of The Pack]
Stand troops, recognize the truth
Here lies the dude who lived rough and died for you
Took slugs and spilt his blood to lace the youth
And told young niggas to get up and face the blues
Cause it's a thugs life, everyday is what we do
Love life, believe and you'll see it through
So to my brother Pac make a place for me with you
I'mma represent you, till I reach the tool

[Chorus: Ray Luv, James "D-Train" Williams, Martha Wash]

[Verse 12: Baby Bash]
He used to clown around, when he came around with the underground
Hit the V-Town with Kyrie on some thunder pounds
Even directed the video (Mac Mall)
He was on some major shit way back then but we didn't know
How a genius get to work, on the herb and the purp
Probably looking down, smiling now on some purp
He had love for us Mexicans
Loves to see young playas stacking Benjamins

[Verse 13: Nump Trump]
I wake up and blaze one for Pac every morning
It's Mr. I Got Grapes, picture me rolling
Everybody knows this, or knew what it was
When we found out Pac passed, it was so messed up
We was crushed, couldn't beleive it, Gorilla-Pinos and all
But we still slap your album so the music lives on
When tomorrow comes, we still ride for Makaveli
From the low-lows to scrapers, you smell me

[Verse 14: Shock G]
Pac, he didn't mean to die, he got in over his head
Died for you but wasn't trying to be dead
He went round and round, cause there wasn't nothing better to do
What could be better than dying for you
Split the blunt, put the Hennessey in the cup
Let me see ya, let me see ya toss it up
We all feel 2Pac, now that he's gone
But recognize those alive who sing the same song, c'mon

[Chorus: Kimberlee Payton, Isa S. Chu, Laura Lane, Nancy Zumwalt]The definition of a playa hata:
A busta
A bitch with a dick
A violator of the Sixth Bar of the Mack Game
"Man, you know that nigga Khayree fuckin Mac Mall on his money, man
You know that nigga Lay ain't gon' get paid
Heard Ray Luv in jail and shit"
Little old bitch-ass muthafuckas
Mac Mall
Young Lay
Ray Luv
I'mma need y'all to come in, man
I need the whole Young Black Brotha Records line-up to come in
And spit some game to these lil' old bitches with dicks
Playa-hatin busta-ass nuthin-ass niggas
Now you nuthin-ass niggas check game

Hey playa, don't it be a point in your life
Where you just wanna smoke a muthafucka, man?

Be real about his fetti though
They all in a nigga mix
What's up, Mac Mall, Ray Luv
What's up, playas?

Hey man, that be them inner way-ass niggas, Lay
Cuz it's like this, man:

Askin me so many questions

(Jealous-ass muthfafuckas...)
Yo, we tryina come real about the fetti though

(I think Ray Luv)
Your nigga Young Ray Luv in the house
(I think I'm finna come on first)
Tell em muthafuckas

[ Ray Luv ]
One mo' time for the streets of Killa Cali
Grew up on the dank and shootin dice up in the alley
Back when niggas had names like Rock Tee, Chin and Butta
O.G. game from the muthafuckin gutter
I guess it was cool when a nigga had no riches
Cuz niggas didn't p.h. and run they mouths like bitches
Much love for the hood, what up, nigga, where's my homies?
Show love for these niggas, but they ain't got no love for me
Jealous as fuck when I got love from the Crest niggas
But all I get is mean mugs from you West niggas
Now that I think these muthafuckas is so funny
'll peel a nigga's cap for a trick-ass nobody
(You better check your heart and your brain, man
I think you niggas need to get up on some game, man)
Picked up on your ho, I'm gettin jocked by your steady
All I want the money though, I'm all about my fetti
Nigga

Money money money's all I know

Money money money's all I see
You need to get some game and quit fuckin with me
Moneeey
(I'm all about my fetti)
Money

[ Mac Mall ]
Now half of these niggas is falsified
The rest is full of mess, so they tend to hide
A lotta them is cowards who be actin hard
Some is tired-ass tricks who will never get far
Some is straight dopefiends tryina grind they lley
But they still pushin pebbles to this muthafuckin day
Some start funk over hoes and blame it on somethin else
Them niggas need to check theyself
But the sucker that I hate the most
Is the busta full of envy, mad cuz he broke
Every night he be stressin, thinkin that his ho wanna get me
I wouldn't fuck her with yo dick, she ain't got nothin to give me
Cuz your nigga is broke, so ho, I know you're starvin
So you won't have to worry about Mac Mall harmin
Your boyfriend and girlfriend relationship
I got my money and my cuddies, who needs a bitch?
Mac Mall will never get played
I'mma stay Ses ways
And you know I'm all about that money

That's all I know, nigga
Fuck them hoes and them niggas
That's all I see in the Triple C
Stop fuckin with me
I'm all about my fetti
I'm all about my fetti

Yeah, my nigga Young Lay
Come serve these fools

[ Young Lay ]
Gettin blimped with a tramp up on ? confusin what's right
To hide the doubt, so I grab my money and my lle', high
Why do these youngsters by so nervous
Niggas creepin thru these turfs
Plus these po-po's tryin to serve us ill
But I kick back and just act with my fuckin clan
And kick that gangsta rap and spit about my gangsta macks
On rap tracks and spit for those that copy free
And givin they dap and tellin me it ain't a day without drink and weed
G's get stacked, now who's a mack, yeah, the nigga shook ya
Ki's of crack get cut down, but but not by the cook up
But yo, they crookers, watchin me all the time
But I keep lookin and keep a nine by my spine
Or to my side, cuz when I ride you'll never know
But if it's over some dough, Young Lay is quick to let it go
And let him know, nigga, that this is loc side
Home of the mack, playa pros, squares run and hide
Cuz tonight we gonna do it just like this
But if your ho is choosin, nigga, the mic's in my fist
Some of this mixed with a whole lotta that
Old fuelin with new, it made my fetti fat

Money money money's all I know

You need to get some game and quit fuckin with me

[Ray Luv]
Yiddo, Yiddo, ha ha ha ha, this yo' nigga Young Ray Luv
Back in yo' motherfucking face, you know?
Ha ha ha ha, the Lynk Crew, no more trouble, just trying to bubble
And this goes out to my son - Baby IE, wassup boy?

I was a hustlin-ass nigga straight lovin' the game
Always meant to be a playa put the Luv in my name
Who put the hustle in this youngster? I guess my daddy's to blame
Coz if it made skrilla, there wasn't no shame in his game
Another young playa, caught up in the fortune and fame
Nigga when I'm gone, will they still remember my name?
Straight soldier, stayed at this here 'till it's over
Old folks laughing, telling my daddy that I'm never sober
Why don't you understand I'm just trying to feed my baby?
I'm going crazy, none of y'all fools can fade me
You trying to save me? Sometimes I feel the love is gone
There I go, out the door to get my hustle on
Dreams of platinum, rap after rap I'm writing back to back
While I hustle stack for stack
I'm caught in the cross, the game twist me into trouble
Forever hustle, I'mma struggle 'till I bubble

Gotta make my money double
Struggle out of trouble, all good
I'mma hustle till I bubble
Gotta make my money triple
Hennessy not ripple
(Big Eddie Spaghetti you gone pop like a pimple)

BG turned OG, gone off that oldie
Went from Zenith's and Vogue's to Lexus I's and gold D's
In love with the game, will I fold G's?
Ain't no tears just beer poured for my homies
A ghetto star, every hood in church know me
Haters want me but trick them suckers long as the set got love for me
I'm Lynked up to the fullest
So you better think nine times before you come at me with some bullshit
The Feds is crackin' down like bullwhips
And niggas' gunnin' for me so when I smoke I keep a full clip
I just wanna get richer
So when you look at success I'm the nigga you seeing in the picture
The B-I-G E-Double-D-I-E Spaghetti
You know me already, nigga with the long fetti
Gangbangin' but never see me with no rag
No time to lag, stuffin' hundreds into Hefty bags
The local motors wanna' battle
I'm gone holler "trump", cause inflation
Move the organization to Seattle
Call my up-North connection
He say, "I got it sewed up in Seattle
Even judges in the next election"
I have a ticket to a Samsonite
Ready to get it on, fool I'm gone on the next flight
A young nigga out to rumble
Got to get my money on, nigga watch my bubble

Gotta make my money double
Struggle out of trouble, all good
I'mma hustle till I bubble
Gotta make my money triple
Hennessy not ripple
(Big Eddie Spaghetti you gone pop like a pimple)

[Young Dre]
My chances gettin' slim in the wind as I'm hustlin'
Straight automatic phone call sidin' in traffic so I'm dumpin'
Coz' all I really wanted was a piece of the ree-zor
I bust so heavy in this geed-ame, I can't ever skeezers out on the grind
Heard 'em motivated poppilin' bubblin' major
Just 19 years old I'm freezing cold fiending for paper
You ain't know I'm a young BG from the 'Tay soakin' game from my older cousin
Convinced to grind 'till I'm ballin, you thought I wasn't
Trying to keep my focus with the daily bomb, better get the Loc'ses
For the chronic got more straight keeps my calm
Flick of the wrist, we get the dopest Coca-Cola
So do the gypsy-twister hocus-pocus A1-Yola
Tear in to any fool thats trying to stop my hustle
It'll be a 211-187 Young Dre is destined to bubble

Gotta make my money double
Struggle out of trouble, all good
I'mma hustle till I bubble
Gotta make my money triple
Hennessy not ripple
(Big Eddie Spaghetti you gone pop like a pimple)

[Ray Luv]
So much fetti I'm feeling hunted
Every epsiode I be lookin' for my face on the Most Wanted
Feel like my life was written by Donald Gould
A kingpin on the run, nigga, like Jesse Owens
Never knowin' which one of these suckers calling themselves a menace
Gonna be pumped off that spinach wanna put a hot-one in a
Young nigga, my grandmomma call me sinner
Look, granny, I just want to make you proud of me and be a winner
Get out of this shit before I'm fade out, doin' bad
Go legit before I'm layed out, on the slab
Who say we can't be hard, and still smart?
Who say I gotta go out to the pen or the county morgue?
Gotta find a way out, my little homies they be rappin'
Me and my mail, let's see what we can make happen
Get in it to win it and pop like Russel Simmons before I finish
A big baller, going out to the book of Guiness
But these playa-haters known to be snitches and traitors
Fool you can't fade us, fuckin' with Big Eddie yes the greatest
Little homies keep writing I'm gonna put five grand on a lawyer
Big Eddie Records got a business license
Rumor has it that my young niggas out there jackin'
Oh, you ain't know? I signed them soldiers now we goin' platinum
I found my route up out the trouble
Out to get my money on, nigga watch my bubble

Gotta make my money double
Struggle out of trouble, all good
I'mma hustle till I bubble
Gotta make my money triple
Hennessy not ripple
(Big Eddie Spaghetti you gone pop like a pimple)

[outro]
For the 1-99-5, straight trying to bubble(Link crew hustlas in this muthafucka)
Everyday I spend in my life, I'm just trying to get my hustle right
I'm on the block chasing mail all day, raisin hell all day

Life's been crazy for me, since the day I could see
Momma died, couldn't cry till I turned 23
Harden my heart to this cold world, grew up a G
Hit up my homies with the same sign they threw up to me
As we got older, I had bigger plans I wanted to fly
18 years old, ready to ride, ready to die
Drinking liquor with the hardest niggas ever alive
Then I realized, only the smartest soldiers survive
I'm chasing heaven cause we living in hell
So we give'em hell around the clock until we living well
And then it might stop
But if not then I guess it's on till we drop off the planet
I lost another friend to jealousy and can't understand it
Found out, most soldiers fall in the heat of the panic
And get to killing they own in this ghetto titanic
I got to hand it to my father, though I took him for granted
He told me, life is what you make it and not how you planned it
What do the future hold when all we ever do is damage
Growing up mannish, I wonder how my son will manage
I pray I to go to heaven through all the drama will I recover
I got enemies that want me and won't rest till I suffer
What do I do?

(Chorus - 2x's)
Everyday I spend in my life, I'm just trying to get my hustle right
I'm on the block chasing mail all day, raisin hell all day
Everyday and Every night, I find another way to make it right
I blaze the weed to the hell go away, Chasing heaven while I bell all day

When I was 17, times could not have been no better
My and my homie wrote raps, smoked, kicked it together
Wore eachother clothes, even stuck hoes together
Small time dreaming of signing doing shows for chedder
Two young niggas, I guess we didn't know no better
Thought we was invincible real niggas live forever
30 white boys jumped up and nobody ran
Handle them Nigga as best as you can
And when you finish niggas bail
Before the rollers catch us again
It's out sight, under the street light fighting with friends
Remember tossing ho's, getting them for the last of they ends
And hit the movie with a blunt or two, drinking on gin
Just the California lifestyle, juvenile sin
Grew up and caught case, both sent to the pen
And even though we went our own ways, we'll meet in the end
I'm raising hell till I see you again
Until then I'm just

(Chorus - 2x's)

My Whole life I guess I always wanted a lover like me
Ambitious, smart and driven from the gutter like me
A little sexy something, something independent and free
With a fuck'em attitude and only listen to me
But all I see is dirty rats, just begging for cheese
Trying to be the baby momma of a nigga with G's
Soon as you leave, the next nigga be fucking with ease
And if you shake that bitch, she'll be fucking the three's
Baby please, I need woman that can roll the weed
Not a gossipy ass hoochie telling all she sees
Sexy and fearless, if they coming not afraid to squeeze
And let'em have it if they need be
I need a soldier like my sistian
First one to bomb when we get it on
And when I'm buckwild, always know how to calm me down
But if I lose her and you happened to find her
Then player know, you got a hell raising rider for sho (A hell raising rider fa sho)

(Chorus - 2x's)Lord, what's my destiny?
Can you help me?
And tell me: will my ambition take me there?

Anything you want
Everything you need
I can give it to you
If you listen to me
Anything you wish
I can grant to be
Come and follow with me
This is your destiny

What do you dream when you asleep at night?

What do you dream when you asleep at night?
(I'm high as a kite)
Wonder why the money's tight and why we bust and fight
I been there, so I know it's rough when you wanna change your life
And no matter what you do, seem like it's never right
Born with a mission, and a heart full of ambition
But it's hard to be all you can be when don't nobody listen
(Daydreamin) Stay schemin and future-wishin
Never got attention till I got my first school suspension
Fool, what's the difference, we all got a path to follow
Pleasure or sorrow, you get another chance tomorrow
Even through struggle, beg, borrow, work or hustle
(Tragedy and trouble) Strive until you rise up out the rubble
(Don't wanna fumble) And you won't if you play it real
The best of me is my destiny when it's fulfilled
And if I fail, will I have the guts to try again
(To make it out before I die in sin) And even then

Anything you want
Everything you need
I can give it to you
If you listen to me
Anything you wish
I can grant to be
Come and follow with me
This is your destiny

If a genie gave you 3 wishes, what would they be?

If a genie gave you 3 wishes, what would they be?
(Health, happiness and money - just for me)?
Or would you wish we'd put the guns down, world peace
Let the blind see and all the starvin people eat
But in reality we faced with greed (and competition)
I do my best to lace my seed, hopin he listen
Jealousy will make you fake friends
Set you up for the wet-you-up
Cause they don't wanna let you up
(Keep a watchful eye for shady Judas)
And home intruders with Mac-11s and Rugers
Ski mask, ready to do ya
As he get older, ambition grows inside a soldier
Chasin narcs on the block with a mouth full of boulders
And though the rollers wanna pull me over (I stay hopin)
With the world on my broad shoulders, hard to be social
Feel peace when releasin ambition through beats and vocals
If they try to bring you down, go local

Anything you want
Everything you need
I can give it to you
If you listen to me
Anything you wish
I can grant to be
Come and follow with me
This is your destiny

If I ever make it to the top...

If I ever make it to the top (then I'll be free)
But if I fall back, tell me, would you remember me?
Or would you ridicule and laugh at Ray and spread rumors
It consumes ya, hate-filled wishes growin like tumors
Stay focussed like my ballin g's, destiny callin me to take it
Oughta be in college, but gambled, think I can make it
Can't be mistakin, no hesitatin, I'm tired of waitin
My frustration growin worse like my situation
(So what you sayin?)
]From this cold-blooded state I'm raised in
Radio stations best get ready for the invasion
Throughout persuasion we touch millions across the nation
And show no fear when we battle the beast we facin
(No limitations) I knock the world up off its axis
Rough as a cactus, we bouncin back like a matress
The fact is, we all on this planet just tryina make it
And leave somethin for future generations

And so we stand

Anything you want
Everything you need
I can give it to you
If you listen to me
Anything you wish
I can grant to be
Come and follow with me
This is your destiny

What do you dream when you asleep at night?

If a genie gave you 3 wishes, what would they be?

If I ever make it to the top, then I'll be freeThis the ex song
For ex-friends, ex-girlfriends
And all them in-the-way-ass muthafuckas
That always got somethin to say
I dedicates this to you
Cause you know what?
I could never be you
And you could never be me
So I'm just gon' be me
You know what I mean?
I'ma do me

[ Chorus ]
You could hate me all you want
But I'ma do me anyway (I'ma do me anyway)
No matter how you try to front
I'ma still do me anyway (still do me anyway)
You could hate me all you want
But I'ma do me anyway (I'ma do me anyway)
(Bouncin) while I smoke my blunt
I'ma still do me anyway (still do me anyway)

Before I had somethin you said I'd never have nothin
Treated like a scrub, couldn't get a hug
Couldn't flip a dub, nobody gives a fuck
I guess it's time to get off my mama's couch
Show the world what I'm about
I'm from the Lleyo
Where busters get broken up like some bagels
Tryin to make mo'
And ball on these busters like ( ? )
Still I break hoes
While niggas spend loot tryin to persuade hoes
Fuck ( ? )
They cross out the town, I need a bitch that's down to make dough
Cause all of my life I only wanted power and mail
And used to be real niggas turned sour and tell
They think that they're winnin but in the end them cowards fail
I'm free as Geronimo and ain't goin back to jail
Cause of these curbs just weak, sour and stale
In this world of deceit, trickery and blood betrayal
Pay back for your sins, old friends gettin impaled
By Hannibal The Great, how can I fail?

[ Chorus ]

The root of all evil is poverty, no stoppin me
Do anything to get out, pimp a bitch or pull a robbery
My mobberies include pistols and pimpin tools
Lick hoes and cowards too
Boss up through power moves
Stay sharp, young nigga, till the game shower you
Begets bring empty threats from suckers without a clue
I'm disengagin, shakin the haters I was raised with
And triple h-in, get splattered across the pavement
Think you'll see a dime of my dough, you're freebasin
Trick niggas stay skirt chasin, macks stay work-lacin
Golddigers worth naythin; I want it all, let's go
Every dollar, franc and every fuckin peso
I'm money-hungry, can't even trust my closest homies
Money's why they want me, but lately I been feelin lonely
Everybody's phoney, it got me clutchin on my chromie
Doin mo' drugs, eyes hollowed-out out showin no love

[ Chorus ]

First you must position yourself
Young niggas who got intentions of wealth
If you sharp, do it yourself
But keep your eyes on the first ones to offer you help
Cause ain't no friends at the end of the world
Life is nothin more than the will to power
Full of backstabbers and cowards
Savage beast, eat a weak and make you shit hours
Most niggas hollerin gangsta, quick to devoured
Cause the smart get power, the hard get flowers
Dear God, remember prayers of a square when I was just a ( ? )
Cause nothin in life's fair, learn young, nobody cares
Mad dogs with empty stares, we ain't fuckin around
Kill the top nigga in town, that's how we gettin down
Now the juice belongs to me and all my riders
Puttin in work for the kids is rollin SUV's
With six TV's, blowin cannabis ( ? )
Thugs dream about power but rarely they ever see it

[ Chorus ]

You know
Just me, nigga
Represent me
Supported by me
From me
To me
I'ma do me anyway
Yeah

You know
I'ma do me
I'ma

Yeah though
Link Crew Hustler

Mobbin on muthafuckas
Is ya'll ready?
I'ma do me

[ Chorus ]I'm gon' do my thing

[ Chorus ]
Everybody wants to be a star
And live it up in California with the cleanest cars
Hot tub, fast women, pull baddest broads
Everybody got the same dream to have it all
Well I know that everybody wants to be the one
To get to blow the most dough and have the biggest fun
Space age cowboy with the biggest gun
Pop life in the spotlight - get you some
(Well I know)

Everybody wants to play the game
Get paid with fame, wrist lit, neck stay with chains
Porno flicks chicks, everybody callin yo name
Old friends done changed, hatin how you ball in the game
Video sets, Summer Jam, video sex
Radio shows, royalty checks, designer clothes
Rolls Royce with the suicide do's
The only dream you and I know
The promised land - ready to go?
Livin your life the way you always wanted to live it
MTV Cribs, Lamborghini without a blemish
Mr. Right Now, number one without a gimmick
Poised to perpetual ballin, nigga, without no finish
Bet you wanna see your face on the cover of a Rolling Stone
Or in the Source mag holdin a chrome
Tyra Banks tryin to blow up the phone
Can't even get in your house, player, teeny boppers surrounded your home
You know?

[ Chorus ]

Rent-A-Cop, fashion shows, TV spots
Got papparazzi chasin your Benz for blocks
With your and your friends shot, ( ? ) pop
Top-notch livin life on runways and movie lots
(Ooh, she hot) Even women be gettin they coochie hot
When they see you on Rodeo chargin the big mail
Attention, Fendi, Prada, Chanel
Dolce Gabana, pretty face for sale
You know

[ Chorus (2X) ]

What better way for you to get mo' fame, see mo' pay
First round draft NBA (But can he play?)
Shoot jays and fadeaways all day
Jokin with Ahmad, Rashad at the end of the game
You're livin the high life, ESPN highlights
Get checks of a fly type, sex with a fly wife
(I wish it was my life!) True, I bet that you do
And if was, nobody probably have it better than you
And almost no one had mo' cheddar than you
Mo' Gucci Coogi sweaters than you
Mo' hoochie groupie letters than you
If not this, then what else would you do?
(Push crack rock or yak or try to work fast food)
Don't make me laugh, dude
I'd rather go dancin at the Playboy Mansion
With June and July, gettin high with Marilyn Manson
No lie, you know that it's true
Which one are you, the wanna-be-a-star-too
And have your own car too
You know what I mean?

[ Chorus (2X) ]

Yeah though
It's that Westside
Straight up out the Lleyo
Link Crew Hustlers
Fem Diggle
Ray Luv
I'm doin it big
Like my little brother Mitch
That's how we doin it for 2K3
And we out
See yaI was a hustlin-ass nigga, straight lovin the game
Always meant to be a playa, put the 'luv' in my name
Surrounded by niggas I was soakin it from
That put the mouthpiece on my English that was broken and dumb
Got me cooled in a swimming pool, in motion like a big old ocean
Highways to a billion, trippin off my next million
Rich like a Sicilian but chillin like a fuckin villain
It's on, ready and willin for 94 to make a killin
Flip a pint of that Hennessy cognac
And a fat sack of that North Bay comeback
Ain't this a bitch, I never thought that it would be like this
Life of a hustler, the brights of the filthy rich
A nigga's guilty quick if he starts rippin shit
I ain't your dopeman, cassettes is all you copy with
Slangin tapes and gettin bent, this is how we represent
And if you're lookin counterfeit, fools might ask what set you're with
But back up in the Bay they don't play off of what you wearin
Niggas trip off silly shit, like hoes and other niggas starin
Forever strugglin, too much to be jugglin
Your boy's on the run g, forever hustlin

"Just a playa with some g-a-m-e"

It'll never quit, every day the same old shit
The dreams of gettin rich and no one left to share it with
Cause life is like a major bitch, livin on this razor, kid
Blowin up was hella sick, even though what them pagers did
Had to finally see the pen, wishin for some dank and gin
Got the game twisted and got me up in missin prints
But now I'm on the block again, think I'm sellin rocks again?
Hell no, I'm slingin them lyrical intoxicants
They try to make this game illegal
Cause I rap strapped with a Desert Eagle
Wanna play me out like Bugsy Sigel
Another plan to see through rap, let all the pranksters rap
And when the real niggas rap, call the shit gangsta rap
The shit is kinda sick to me, how did I get addicted g?
Shouldn'ta touched the d, now it's all about my family
Ball or die, nigga, is my m.o., I got my money on the razor
Cause major labels wouldn't listen to my demo
Stay away from shobs, pray to god it'll never stop
Stayin on my toes till a young muthafucka pop
Quit smokin week when a nigga quit strugglin
But I'll never give the game up, forever hustlin

"Just a playa with some g-a-m-e"

That girl is my 24 ho, what you don't know
It's Candy, but better than blow
It feels good in your hand like a pistol grip
And have you jumpin all around like Chrystal Meth
You feel dizzy as fuck, like off the Hymen brew
Got you geekin off the very first line or two
Now you're sprung off the tongue, it'll never quit
Got them young niggas o.g.'in on this playa shit
Now I'm back on the track, fool, I'm ready
A joint full bomb, call me Big Eddie Spaghetti
Cause I'm movin much weight to the one stops, it's all musical
Costs you a ten pop to get the usual
Game that starts with the letter G
Had to stop freestylin cause these styles ain't free
And that's real, sworn struggler, dank smuggler
Entrepreneur, big ballin-ass hustler

And the game don't stop, man
Link Crew, niggaI couldn't wait to get atcha
It's been a while since you had a real nigga and a rapper
With some game to spit atcha
Snatch ya, get your mind ready for a new chapter
Ride because we has ta, death before we captured
Caught your ass up like the rapture
Did I get em? I split em
Made a new tape, let the rhythm hit em
I just invent em, inject you with the raw venom
Every turf and block, I'm knockin out your car system

If you were them, you'd best prepare for combat
Gon' be a long one, best to bring the bomb sack
These so-called players ain't real no mo'
Snitch-hatin hustle and still we kill for dough
Real for sho', I'm knowin that they phoney and faulty
Just lice on my balls, I cut em up off me
Now these jealous muthafuckas want me, ain't that a bitch
Like I'm a punk and you could play me out, you fuckin trick
Must be suckin on a glass dick
I'm smokin weed, drinkin O.E. like '86, raise the dick
Can you see me bout some major shit or is you minus?
Small timers with a bitch-made click of co-signers
Not a rider withcha, think you're safe, but I can getcha
And do things to ya Lynch Hung can't even picture
You'se a bitch nigga, and I be livin in new knowledge
Cross me up again, I take your baby girl for hostage

I couldn't wait to get atcha
It's been a while since you had a real nigga and a rapper
With some game to spit atcha
Snatch ya, get your mind ready for a new chapter
Ridme because we has ta, death before we captured
Caught your ass up like the rapture
Did I get em? I split em
Made a new tape, let the rhythm hit em
I just invent em, inject you with the raw venom
Every turf and block, I'm knockin out your car system

And I be down for mine, wrote out my gameplan line for line
On how to get the money, same time blow your mind
Incorporated real soldiers from the O this time
Sellin all q.p.'s, whole o's and dimes
CDs, LPs, now it's g's for us
Flip the table, bubble up, cash and weed to puff
Bet I couldn't serve ya, so I laughed, called your bluff
Give me 12 months, bet you can't ball with us
Ghettonomics is a major plus, enforced with muscle
Mind on the mega-money, heart on the hustle
Dirty women mixed with jealous friends, nothin but trouble
Got focus, keep your self-respect, and know who love you
You don't have to be a star, baby, no need to front
Just gotta know where you're tryina go, and what you want
We dissect and reconstruct the package like a surgeon
Bouncin twice, raise the price, ready to serve ya

I couldn't wait to get atcha
It's been a while since you had a real nigga and a rapper
With some game to spit atcha
Snatch ya, get your mind ready for a new chapter
Ride because we has ta, death before we captured
Caught your ass up like the rapture
Did I get em? I split em
Made a new tape, let the rhythm hit em
I just invent em, inject you with the raw venom
Every turf and block, I'm knockin out your car system

For certain, I knew when I made it that it'd be curtains
For muthafuckas fakin the loyalty and desertin
Put it down, flashin on foes, when I'm pervin
Not silent, I'm hard to swallow like lead and Bourbon
Nigga feel me like a crack serum, no pretendin
Link soldiers, uncompromisin, unbendin
Do or die till the very endin
Why do they fake it
Claim to be any muthafucka just to make it
It's my dream, I'ma take it, seize it, no hesitation
No reservation, finally ready to face the nation
Attackin like a pit was raised, now can you fade me?
Writin bomb-ass shit off of hash the sight gave me
Is it greed got me chasin g's or just in me?
To feed me and my only seed, so we proceed
All my enemies bleed as I puff up the weed
Forever hustle till we all succeed

I couldn't wait to get atcha
It's been a while since you had a real nigga and a rapper
With some game to spit atcha
Snatch ya, get your mind ready for a new chapter
Ride because we has ta, death before we captured
Caught your ass up like the rapture
Did I get em? I split em
Made a new tape, let the rhythm hit em
I just invent em, inject you with the raw venom
Every turf and block, I'm knockin out your car systemI bounced out the house about a quarter to three
I grabbed my cellular phone, some bumblebee from M-D's
Playa-haters on the block, it don't matter to me
I make G's they all recognize the P
Popped in that B.I.G. coz "it was all a dream"
All a scheme to run with the ballin' team
I run through money like a counting machine
Stay clean in the collar, might whip up outtie in a Saleen
Sip that Hennessy from here to Tennessee
And anywhere in between, got Lynk Crew on the scene
Bet they got true playas in all the states
But it's that Bay Area brother from the ballin' state
I been a hustlin-ass soldier since 83, wait and see
Old school partners they'll be hating me
Playa-haters lay awake to "Creep" like TLC
Straight up, "I Saw it Coming" like EPMD
Let's hear it for the cream, the triple-beam and the whole ball team
Paper-chase by all means
All these nationwide ballers they be callin' me, mang
Got them stories for sale, I'm in the game, boy

In the game (I'm in the game, boy!)
In the game, makin' mail
In the game (I'm in the game, boy!)
In the game with stories for sale (with them stories for sale)
(repeat)

Pay me a visit to Valle-Jo and even though I'm not from there
I got partners that recognize a Lynk Crew playa
A ghetto star, cleaner than the Board of Health
With a radar you still couldn't see me like Stealth
So I'm out to the bone, I knew him from the "Money On" days [?]
He used to clown but tell me, "be about your money always"
Wattup killer? Why you ain't hollered at me?
Had to move up, no more Towallamie Street
What you know? I went from hustlin' to having it major
Puffin' bumblebee and reminiscing life on the razor
Used to look like only hard times was comin' my way
Now it's hard rhymes and Alize everyday
It's pimpin', I had to finally lay my cards on the table
You ain't mackin' unless you got nine more in your stable
No more jail, double-digits, thousands on bail
In the game, makin' mail, got my stories for sale

In the game (I'm in the game, boy!)
In the game, makin' mail
In the game (I'm in the game, boy!)
In the game with stories for sale (with them stories for sale)
(repeat)

1-9 to the 9-5 I'm in the game like EA Sports
In it 'till I'm finished to win it and I'll never fall short
On the ball, calling the game, mang, having things well
Player campaigning from the Bay to the A-T-L
Say we bail to a mid party, sidin' the Vette
Bet I'll have you going buck wild, drippin' in sweat
Cause the kid got 'nuff styles, give me much respect
They call me, "Airtight Eddie" the game is tough to check
I think back on how it used to be struggling for green
Had to juggle between hustlin' and living my dream
Bustin' raps in the bathroom, dreaming 'bout wealth
Can't nobody give it to me, gots to make it myself
So now who put this together? Nigga, me, that's who
Who do I trust? Who? Not you if it ain't Lynk Crew
A young troop doing it for my soldiers in jail
In the game, stackin' mail, got my stories for sale

In the game (I'm in the game, boy!)
In the game, makin' mail
In the game (I'm in the game, boy!)
In the game with stories for sale (with them stories for sale)
(repeat)

[outro]
Yiddo yiddo
The game gets thick on that you can bet
A real true to the game playa for sho' gone stack chips
Ha ha ha, yiddo
That's why I continue to represent
And fo' sho' get all the wealth I can get
Till my dyin' day I remain a Lynk Crew soldier
And it's Young Ray Luv for the 1-99-5, represent
Playa' campaigning all year, ha ha, you know?
An' I'm out

[OG#1] (deep inhale) I'mma tell you right now
[OG#2] Wuzzat?
[OG#1] If the nigga got a phony tape, I'mma beat the nigga ass when I see 'im
[OG#2] Nigga, pass the motherfuckin' joint!
[OG#1] I'mma pass it motherfucker just wait for a minute!
[OG#2] Hurry the fuck up!
[OG#1] I wanna hear this shit!
[OG#2] Shit
[OG#1] The last tape he had was some cool shit
[OG#2] Yeah, was cool
[OG#1] But a motherfucker don't want to hear all that ol' heeby shit
[OG#2] Fuck nah!Lately I been feelin like Joe, all alone
X-ed out and I can't go home - ain't no home
Almost everyone I love dead and gone
So I puff till my head is blown
I remember bein 19, juice to have ends
Used to have friends, the loot I had went
And you know when the money spent where the homies went
The phoney split and left me in the wilderness
Life a test, made a wish by the burning bush
Purge my soul, all I need's a little push
Schemers plot, never seem to stop
But he told me: Watch, soon you'll see them rot
I got a knot in my stomach and it's eatin me up
Flashbacks of my bigger brother beatin me up
Up stressin, I ain't sleepin enough
Enough already 'fore I crack the hell up
And load the Mac the hell up

[ Chorus ]
I got it bad, oh where can I go
I'm in the gutter, gonna do it like Joe
Shit got me clutchin my chrome
I'm high as fuck losin touch with my soul
Cause I don't never wanna go back to broke
Like I be lustin for dough
They say it's wrong but what else can we do
That's all that shit is, to hustle for loot
No matter what you must do
But even if it's still real rough
That's all I see when I puff
Sometime the money ain't enough

New day, a touch of the sunshine
But I wake up with a mug, no love for the one-time
It's blaze a blunt time, help me deal with the pain
Time to put it down for my hustle, get real with the game
Cause money make the world revolve, a damn shame
And the Generation X is the next to blame
But who the ones makin the guns and bringin the caine?
Can you feel me what I'm addressin when singin the pain
Daddy prayin for me believin one day I'ma change
But the devil steal my mind and he drive me insane
So Mr. Teacher, tell me what should we do?
( ? ) cause nobody else believin in you
We all crazy; now what people do is outrageous
Homies'll turn haters, shady for dirty paper
Even ( ? ) turn rapists tryin to ( ? )
Cause a young nigga ballin like the Lakers

[ Chorus ]

What happened to love? Gave us all drugs
Now the kids raised thugs with hollow-point slugs
Evil mean mugs, rougher without no fate
We suffer and learn hate and end up in a sherm state
Many give up, tryin to live up to the status
So they slip up, tryin to pull that they baddest
Or the mack with the fattest Lac sit on 20 inches
Mo' fame, mo' friends, mo' money, mo' bitches

[ Chorus repeated until end ]Yiddo yiddo

Bumpin and blastin the beat

Vogues with the gold stripe
Folding bank roll from the hole in my windpipe

Representin once again L-C to the end
Young hustlas international crack smugglers
Game jugglers
North Bay ballin bubblers
Brother the game gets sticky like a Zig-Zag
Tricky player in fact
It's hard to keep it intact
At times you might think you gonna lose your mind
Just push rewind and soak the game up out of every line
And you gone find a young soldier back against the wall
In the game makin mail off of all of yall

(repeat till end)[ Chorus: Aaron Hall ]
I think I wanna get away
I think I wanna fly, fly away
Fly away
A nigga need to get away
I think I need to get high today
And fly away

[ VERSE 1: Ray Luv ]
Superfly, like a Indo weed and ecstacy high
I gotta get me some, muthafuckas losin they mind
Along with they life, everybody wantin to die
But scared to give in, God, can you teach a nigga to fly?
I'm tryin to get by, get high till I bust through the sky
But I'm stuck in the ghetto, for the life of me I can't tell you why
I'm losin focus, havin flashbacks of rats and roaches
And ripped sofas, no matter what, I'm gettin over
I be damned if I go back to that shit and livin sober
Still I feel the pain, so I pray for God to send a rainbow
Oh what a tangled web do we weave when we ( ? )
Get caught up in some shit we can't handle when in the mangle

[ Chorus (w/ad-libs) ]

[ VERSE 2: Ray Luv ]
Now what could take me higher than Hen, the weed or the gin
The greed or the sin, the grave or the pen - imagine
Peaceful days and nights full of passion with no blastin
Or everlastin repercussions of caskets and sadness
We need a new drug for the masses, Superfly
That won't cost me a dime when I'm jonesin to get high
No need for scissors, zig-zags or plastic bags
Niggas love the rush from the moment they take a drag
Better than cannabis, I know it's hard to believe
Closer to angel dust, impossible to conceive
Go 'head and take a puff, and then you know what I mean
Can't never get enough of the stuff that's servin the fiends
The herb of your dreams take you away from murderous themes
And leadin my team till the players land in honey and cream
The money's cool but won't help me when I struggle to breathe
All of us bleed, so all of us have a spiritual need

[ Chorus (w/ ad-libs) ]

[ VERSE 3: Ray Luv ]
I'm startin to peak, I finally found a worthy release
From all of my stress cause every day I battle the beast
And think about [Name] I wonder if he restin in peace
My son and my niece, I wonder if they'll ever be free
They say we should teach but will the people ever be reached
And finally see the value of the life that we breathe
All of us need, everybody got a hope and a dream
We plant em like seeds and pray to God they growin to trees
Battered and bruised, life will beat you down on your knees
You only lose if you snooze or you choose to retreat
I look inside me for answers tot he questions I seek
And swear when I speak, mobbin with the ( ? ) I keep
I reach for the moon, nobody's superflier than me
With my head in the clouds, happy, high as can be
Won't you come along with me
(Won't you come along with me)

[ Chorus (repeated w/ ad-libs) ]

[ Aaron Hall (repeated w/ ad-libs) ]
Get high with me
And fly away with me

[ Ray Luv ]
Yeah though
This song is dedicated to George Clinton
The man that said
Free yo mind and yo ass will follow
Remember that
We doin' it till 2000
The new millennium
Peace

[ Aaron Hall ]
Do you understand what he's sayin?
I'm talkin about within yourself
Baby
Oh yeah
Get the message
Oh yeah1987 I was all in watching my O-Gs out there ballin
Yes yes y'all it was on like a light switch
Niggas was getting rich, the game was getting thick
88-89, still was spectating soaking up game
Gettin laced and watchin all the playa-hatin
Right about now I'm on my own, 17 and grown
Time for me to get my motherfucking hustle on
1991 I hit the track for myself me and Andy
I was writing raps he was grinding on that candy
Tash was rhyming, it dont matter it was hell
To make a little mail, to make a lotta bail
Possession for sales was the case
Many caught em, hubba rock was the shit
Thats why so many fiends bought em
Sprung off that ice cream
Living they life on the pipe dream
But we wasn't trippin
Had to be about our lean, right?
I stole the same fool's load almost every night
Just a part of the game carjacker
Out to get my money on the motherfucking factor, nigga

1991 my nigga Likky-Los took me to his rappin folks
On the north pole side of Valle-Jo
I left the cook-up got the hookup from my nigga Drizzze
Been on since 92 a nigga stay about his pizzzay
Hustler-Hatin-Hoes be on the lookout for him when you see him
Hide up at the cookout act like you don't know him
Coz a young broad to me ain't nothin but a record sale
Young and so sprung but got a nigga makin hella mail
But dont get it twisted my game is a department
Poppin outta control gettin swoll fuckin movie stars
And it was on like that for the 92
But I never knew the dirty shit that a bitch'll do
Set a nigga up for the jack-a-mack
Musta been a crack attack
Roll and slam me down like the motherfucking Shaq Attack
Gotta get this groupie back
Musta been that hootie mack
That would make this hoochie rap
Wanna get my money stacked
Thats why you gets no love in fact
You could get a slug for that
Gone without no get it back
Yo this fucker's trying to jack
So you just a jack-a-ho
Niggas love to mack-a-ho
She could be a sack of hoes but she ain't no factor though
Yeauh, bitch, ha ha

1995 this game's for all of y'all
While I'm back from the clink and I'm ballin y'all
Young Ray, the nigga of the niggas want to be like me
A G like me
But they can't see me in the diggy-dark
I'm creepin' through the piggy-park
Undercover cop try to watch from a Skylark
Read him like a sex book, out to get an ex-crook
I left his ass shook, gone by the next look
You'll never get your jack on
Get to slip some crack on Ray and do me hard
Better dress warm
Coz I got several attourneys on my payroll
I hope you like the cold you'll be working at the North Pole
Huh, it's kind of simple when I pop like a pimple
Drink Hennesse not ripple and watch my money triple
At night I be kickin, up a tree stickin
Coz my tape's on hit like barbeque chicken
Got your girlfriend geekin
Y'all ain't even speakin coz you heard
She was freakin with the Lynk last weekend
Ran through 92 mobbin' like a tractor
Stayed a G in 93 and 95 the motherfucking factor, nigga, yeauh

[outro]
Nizine Fizour, yeah real that's Young Ray
They don't feel me though, whoooo-hooo
And that's real
Mac Mall!
Yiddo I'm still the factor baby
Even though your boy can't make it to LA on this one man
You know? But it's all good, wassup?! Yeah!
Where them Lynk niggas at man?
You know? Ha ha ha ha, you a fool, aaaah
Say that man, you know? Yeah
This one goes out the L-O-motherfucking-S
Who had me touchin down in 1991 in the V
And put your boy on the map like this here
This one's for you, baby boyeee[ VERSE 1: Ray Luv ]
Where was you at the day the world ended, was you free?
Out feelin good and livin splendid, or on your knees?
Or was you with the realest of your homies, just smokin weed
Or in a gutter drunk, cold and hungry, a broken dream?
I knew a preacher and a school teacher, they both was fiends
All that glisten ain't really gold, although it seems
At times I know fo' sho' that I ought, just for the dream
If I fail to succeed, then it's all up to me
So let us ball like the 1st and 15th
Call shots out of drop tops, chasin the cream
Not for the greed, just to fulfill the prophecy for the seed
And know that we ain't stoppin till we stronger with g's, no longer in need
Come on

[ Chorus ]
Where will I be when the Lord callin for me
When the game come callin for me
Where do we go when this whole world's over, over
What will I see when we finally meet our destiny
When the game comes callin for me
Where do we go when this whole world is over, over

[ VERSE 1: Ray Luv ]
Who did you love the day the world ended, family and friends?
With your final days, how did you spend em, jealous of men
So many people disillusioned in this world that we in
No solutions, just mass confusion, the line is thin
Between eternal salvation and sin, when I die
Do dreams and deeds die with men? I can't lie
At times I wanna cry and repent for my soul
When I'm alone and all the money is spent, what do I do?
When the missiles 'bout to blow up the Earth
And all I know is how to smoke big and throw up the turf
With your time left you better give the world what you're worth
And spend every new day, brother, like it was your first
It was your first

[ Chorus ]

[ VERSE 1: Ray Luv ]
What's my destiny, fuck it, let me chase it and face it
And even if I don't make it, I'd rather fall off than fake it
Nothin can hold us back, when will we take it
Even though I know the slippery surface out there layin and waitin
And player-hatin, I know it must be frustratin just tryin to live
Raisin four and five kids with no time to give
Fuck the world, for me life just ain't a joy to live
It's like a rollercoaster ride with two busted ribs
That's probably why we all lust for chips, rush for shit
Get it quick, before the world and the millenium flip
May these words that I wrote give a young brother hope
Lord knows it's hard to cope through the hate and the dope

[ Chorus ]This is Il Duce
Five star general
Ray Luv
And I brought some real thugs with me
General EDI Amin
General Napoleon
General Kastro
And General Noble
Soldiers in the game

[ Chorus ]
Fuck the cops, they'll never stop us
Not even with batterams, full-metal jackets and helicopters
We got choppers, we young mobsters
Money, power and star fame
Die or ride, nigga, in this war game
Fuck the teachers who couldn't reach us
They try to police, cell at the jail house, seat ya
Don't wanna see ya, it's the teacher's the one to blame
Now I'm havin star fame
Fuckin off money in this war game

[ VERSE 1: Ray Luv ]
Pull out my weapon, now I'm steppin, bringin foes my heat
We challenge number one contenders and blow holes in the weak
It's been a while, now we finally got our turn to bust
Bitch niggas got rich while the homie burned to dust
Got me madder than a bag of fuckin sherm and dust
You wanna kick it (but can't hang with us)
Now we gon' see who got the biggest fuckin nuts in this thang of us
Talkin shit, but nigga, you ain't came to bust
Make you pull out the gold cuff links and the pinky rings
(These niggas don't know who they fuckin with, man)
Big Eddie eat a muthafucka like spaghetti
In the formation we ready, freebasin the competition for fetti
Shoot your shit up like civil war Gettysburg
(What if they hit us back?) Don't be absurd
We put it down like a fat-ass crew of construction workers
(Fuck with us now, nigga, there's gon' be a murder)
And that's for certain, catch the muthafuckin curtain call
Workin y'all, smokin big, hurtin y'all, Link 'Lawz serve em all
Break a muthafucka off, soldier, raw dog
Smother everything livin for the muthafuckin cause
I'm a rebel without a pause
A untouchable, better keep your paws off
Or meet the sawed off
We all balls, nigga, and all hog
Westside till I die, rough, rugged (real raw, nigga)

[ Chorus ]

[ VERSE 2: EDI Amin ]
Now who the fuck want trouble
Me and the 'Lawz bring the drama on the double
Bustin out a bubble, gettin you for a bundle
Stickin you in the trunk, too, fuck you
You thought we wouldn't touch you? We rushed you
EDI Amin died, I watch a young nigga rise up
Born a fuckin rider, ain't gon' stop till I gotta
Fuck coppers and the world, bang back till they feel us
My freedom come with a mag, so they probably gon' kill us
They only gon' hear us when we there heavy metal
So take ( ? ) my niggas, we got a score to settle
War games, but it really ain't a game
Muthafuckas is sprayin, body parts hangin
Gangbangin, turf wars or whatever you wanna call it
We're all dyin for it

[ Chorus ]

[ VERSE 3: Young Noble ]
Nob layin back in a Ac seat, blast my heat
Watch theses niggas run like they in a track meet
Smash my past beef, got blasted on the last street
They all weak if you ask me
Still a deuce slugger, Outlaw like a muthafucka
Doubt y'all like a muthafucka
You need to raise up
Before you fuck around and get blazed up
Before you fuck around and get chased up
By some Jersey thugs, don't care who you thought or
Heard we was, I murder your blood
Or your next akin, hop out on your blcok
In a stretch Benz, protect the neck your best friend
Just to fuck with ya, you're hardcore, do your thug thizzle
Nigga, these Outlaw streets, they love ( ? )
And Khadafi, cause niggas cock the hammers sloppy
I'm there when y'all callin, ain't down without me
Outlawz

[ Chorus ]


[ VERSE 4: Kastro ]
Hey yo, I don't play fair, warfare never been fair
Make a giant non-violent, turn a bear to a queer
This thug life we stuck with it, born, sick and tired
And tired of bein sick, I'm torn and I ain't lyin
In this deadly game of death could be no fun at all
Sleepin on your feet, pistol deep against the wall
Day one and day none is how I do it, do it all
True and truer than y'all, yellin, "Fuck the law"
( ? ) where it's darker than a thousand nights
Although we walkin under sun in a thousand lights
Wantin a thousand stripes, findin a life of your own
Livin ill or in prison alone on the bone
It's a hard thing, sho' as hell ain't no card game
It's all plain and all pain in this war game[ Chorus ]
Baby, tell me if you're with it, with it
Is it cool, can I get it, can I come over
Hit it when the club over
Tell me if you're really with it
Is it cool when I get it, act a fool
Can I hit it by the pool
Baby, tell me if you're with it, with it
Is it cool, can I it when the club over
Bring a little love over
Tell me if you're really with it
Is it cool, can I get it in the pool
Can I video it too?

Caught up in your lust
Knew I'd be back from the moment we touched
I get a head rush when I'm up in ya
Like when the lead bust; bad bitch
Lookin like she mixed on some half shit
Freaky bitch have a weaker nigga in a casket
Every time I call you (it's on), but I ain't no fool
Probably have a dozen other ballers callin you too
All in you, too, but I ain't the one that's fallin for you
When I hit you just wanna know that it's cool
Are you with it, can you dig it? My intentions explicit
Cause I fiend for the way you kissin and lickin
So intense, you make me feel it in my wildest dreams
High off the E or just chillin
Got you blowin up my two-way, ready and willin
Such a nasty little chassy cause we ain't even friends
We just ("Hi") fuck ("Goodbye") then I'm gone in the wind
Till that next time I'm jonesin and I'm on it again
Me and my part-time fuck friend caught up in sin

[ Chorus ]

I'm at the club 360, poppin big Cristy
Didn't bring no bitches but I'm takin some with me
Yellin dumb things to them ones with the tongue rings
Two-ways and thumb rings, young things with sprung game
I got bitches in the elevator gettin it on
Busters handcuffin hoes and they sendin em home
I met two from New Jeru I just took to the Brougham
Puertorican speakin Spanish while they givin me dome
No play for the small-timers while they floss on the phone
Cause he lackin the mackin tools and still livin at home
Workin that ticket-face Rolex that he copped on a loan
While I'm self-made, self-paid, popped on my own
I seen visions ever since the moment I was christened
Of me bein king, every word that I send straight ism
Don't try to lie, see the look in yo eyes
I think your man ain't fuckin you right, let's take a ride

[ Chorus ]

Rollin in my new Lex SE-4
Had a little fun, now I'm ready to go
On her mama's frontdo' step I let her go
Smash home, blazin a rope about a quarter to fo'
When I pull up to my house, nigga, whaddaya know
It's little mama in the furcoat from the weekend befo'
LA type, probably lookin for dough
But I'm thinkin that I can get her for mo'
And have her flippin me rolls
We upstairs and she rippin my clothes
Hangin on me like a new pair of Girbauds
Vampire, all on my throat
Take it easy, baby, nice and slow
You gon' get it but first think I like to know
Is if you with it

[ Chorus ]
