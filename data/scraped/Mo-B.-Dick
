Booh! Booh!
XDVR
SQUAH!

[Strofa 1]
Lo sbirro infame guarda male quando passiamo (Booh! Booh!)
Vito vai piano
Saliamo al settimo piano
Ganja appoggiata sul tavolo, contiamo il cash sul divano
1K di AK, nascosto dentro la giacca e manco te ne accorgi
Per avere le tasche piene domani, oggi mi riempio le tasche di IG
Sai come funziona? No, no, no, non credo frà
Chie-Chiedi ai ragazzi di zona
Sia-Siamo cresciuti coi buchi alle suole
Ma guardando il sole, sognando di stare la sopra
In giro di notte, in mezzo alle troie
Gli sputa palline, le guardie corrotte
La strada mi chiama, non voglio sentirla
Mi chiama più forte

[Ritornello]

Quindi tu non disturbarli per niente

[Strofa 2]
Giro nel quartiere sospetto
Si sente l'odore dell'etto (Booh! Booh!)
Nessun angelo custode è con me (no! no! no!)
Devo stare attento perchè c'ho
L'OG nelle tasche
OG nelle tasche
OG nelle tasche
OG nelle tasche
Cosa vuoi?
Quanto vuoi?
Cosa vuoi?
Quanto vuoi?
Cosa vuoi?
Quanto vuoi?
Quanto vuoi?
Quanto vuoi?[Verse 1]:

Whatchu' know about actually caring, Whatchu' know about actually staring
The future in its face, like I'm ready, that's what I do everyday, but i don't think that shit's apparent
I walk, what other just talk, I keep the shoes as a souvenir, if you could actually wear them, its my fault
For using heart, that's how I'm stepping ho, got a stethoscope if you could actually hear them
See Rawn so honest they have to compare him, to Ab Lincoln either that or put my raps in Aquarium
Cuz I'm wet, everybody riding, till i put up beside them, they dont know what they staring
Things change you don't know if you teaching or learning, the truth hearts, yeah it feel like im teaching a sermon
Im 100 as i creep the burner, tryna be the biggest thing out of Maryland, and its forever concerning, No Lie!

[Hook]:

Baby, Know I'm worth it, know i deserve it, though i ain't perfect
Yeah, But as long as we working, please don't tell me no lies
Yeah, Please don't tell me no lies

[Verse 2]:

Dont lie to me, not even if I receive
Its no point, I already prove I can read
Right through you, its like Voodoo, I stick in you, so just stick wit me
When you close your eyes, I wantchu to picture me, no photo's lets capture the bigger scene
As I hit the screen, it make me picture things, like walking out but I always hit the screen
I don't never finish, and maybe that's the problem, if I don't got I try it because its just an options
I done had a lot of babies, like adoption, I done heard a lot of maybe's still I'm watching
Everybody talking patience, well I got it, I'm a man under god, so i need a goddess
I'm saving, writing waivers, like I'm the copers, you got to do me no favors, just do me honors

[Hook]:

Baby, Know I'm worth it, know i deserve it, though i ain't perfect
Yeah, But as long as we working, please don't tell me no lies
Yeah, Please don't tell me no lies

Yeah, Please dont tell me no lies

[Verse 3]:

In any situation, in any shit you facing, honesty the key, that and participation
Love should never require solicitation, we all live with the desire that shit is basic
Rawn just one of the riders who need a placement, thinking over the top, but still stuck in the basement
Maybe if i ain't hear they'll see that they wasted, time of one of the greatest, god as created
Through these long days, and these slow nights, as im getting blazed, i hope it goes right
Bitch im going in, finna earn my stripes, and on the inside, tell me Lies

[Hook]:

Baby, Know I'm worth it, know i deserve it, though i ain't perfect
Yeah, But as long as we working, please don't tell me no lies
Yeah, Please don't tell me no lies[Verse 1: OnlyOne]
I'm giving up...
Even though I'll know they'll be here when the chips are up
If we die the world doesn't give a fuck
Cause killing a world never meant shit to us
If beings from other planets learn to live with us
If they can't: is it them, or is it us?
Sharks in bloody water, I jump in it
I'm grateful for every day the sun's risen
My only fear is my work going unfinished
Somebody witness, someone get killed for bus tickets
Your life could be taken in one instant...
But this is just one instance
We worship things we imagine like tall tales
We pledge allegiance to a banner that's star spangled
Beneath the magma of a volcano
I await famine and the Archangel
And all I can say is...

[Chorus: Illmaculate]
Goodbye world, I'ma miss you
But not as much as you'll miss me
When it's all said and done
The question becomes: are you afraid to be free?
They saying goodbye hearse
If I miss you, more than you miss me
I just find inner peace within a dream
And let go, I ain't afraid to be free
Say goodbye world...

[Verse 2: Ethic and Mo-B]
And we aim for the summit
Been a long time coming, there's an ache in my stomach
We spend 'em all, but these days ain't abundant
A wrecking ball, that I take and I run with
When I'm done with it all, and this curtain falls for me
No comfort's taking if my work is not coursing
Through the blood it is pouring
The bloodletting's upsetting when we see those with no puddles forming
So we trudge on forging
A new path to do math and use that morphine
Like it subdues that scorching effect
When there's nobody left to set our corpse free

They say the good die young
Well I got a long time 'fore my time comes
Will I rise with the sun if I rest in the sunset?
I must admit I'm preoccupied by all these notions of judgment
Comparin 'em to Judas Iscariot
Sometimes the stick's more motivating than the carrot is
I'm judging arrogance, once that dirt covers
Before too long I'll be sporting them earth colors

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Goldini Bagwell]
Off the wall, and I'm smiling for all the wrong reasons
I'm but an odd ball tipping the scales just to get even
All in all, I'll take the chances and take your hand this evening
So you'll feel no withdrawal the moment you realize I'm leaving
Hah... and I won't be back
Don't get attached, my last one-night-stand told me that
So I show love, with a grain of salt
But when karma struck I was like, "Hold up, it ain't my fault!"
I was conditioned to put up these fences
So on the day of my conviction we'll have to breakthrough
Before they take you
Besides, the look in their eyes is less convincing
When you can see 'em flinching from a bird's-eye view
Almost through with my last will and testament
It's a Russian roulette, and guess who the next contestant is
Let me tip my glass and ash my herb
Before I pass I leave you with these last words

[Chorus][Hook - Game]
Three killas on the rise
Come through screamin' homicide when we ride
When we ride
Three killas on the rise
Come through screamin' homicide when we ride
Nigga, Westside

[Verse 1 - Eastwood]
Yo, I caught him at the corner liquor store, ran him for his jewels
Told him "give me everything you got, hat to the shoes"
You done show me what it is, now show me what it do
I done jacked a gang of bitch ass niggas like you
My profile suspect I'm wanted for murder
Investigated by the feds on old shit I ain't heard of
In '94 they say ya boy was involved in a car jack
That's when my phone start trippin', I'm knowin' my shit tapped
Tryna tell me how I'm livin' like they BET
Sometimes I feel like there's a camera in my TV screen
I am the best, ever since my moms left
I ain't holdin' my breath, I'm prosecuted to death
It's Eastwood, I'm as deadly as turpentine
Spittin' venomous rhymes with more heart then Valentine's
When we ride

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Game]
Life is what you make it sometimes I see blatant
Visions of Satan, I been smokin' hell of them marijuana vapors
With dreams of gettin' paper on felonious capers
Run a car for neighbors, bangin' The Best of Anita Baker
Now is that sacred? When niggas spend money on Jacob's
And it's that same shit that get blood spilled on the pavement
I'm patiently waitin', for God to open heaven' gates and
I'll take a knife in my heart before I murder my neighbor
And for that I'm hated, cause most of they rhymin' is basic
Dropped one album and left the whole world stuck in amazement
Started with Rakim, found him in my mom's basement
One demo tape and I'm on Em and Dr. Dre shit

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Techniec]
The 'hood got me feelin' like my back against the wall but I been here before
Let me fly or give me death, while I'm in here for dough
My pops used to hustle the corner in Lotto kicks
Attempt to try 'em on, didn't like that fit
Went after a record deal, shit I got that spit
Besides niggas ain't flyer than Tech at this shit
I'm a natural nigga, so it's only right to boss up
After these figures, so classical nigga
Had to document the avenue, study the set
Back to the OG's, create a new avenue nigga
So we could ride, rims spinnin' off the chrome
Check the rearview, Wave spittin' off the dome
Honey, the Westcoast is on

[Hook][Verse 1: Sapient]
And I don't need a job to get the dues paid, but I do need to get paid in a regular way before doomsday
The rent comes too late. It's employment or inspiration, and it's a rude awakening when you don't get paid for your labor
But I must have it all wrong 'cuz my heads sick, obsessive compulsive I wash my hands of your stresses
But it takes less with to get highly *can't make out what he says here*, and acceptance- is it worth the adjustment of my sentence?
So if you're human than I am. And if you're not human you better hurry and teach me how to be like that
I'm starting to stop - the Earth is more than just a parking lot - and part of me thought, I should figure it out before my arteries rot
My thoughts get complex, unlike your nonsense
I hope the power doesn't go out my wardrode is electronic
Forever walking on the surface of the quicksand, my sonnet forever resonates with hi-hats, snares, kicks and...

[Hook]
If I were a rich man I'd put down the fiddle and get off this fucking roof. (Get off the fucking roof)
If I wasn't a sick man I would act more civil or at least in front of you. (In front of you)
If I was a perfect man I wouldn't need vices, but I do. (But I do)
And if I was a simple man I wouldn't speak like this, but I do. (But I do)

[Verse 2: Mo-B]
If I want war man with nothin' to lose you'd be envious of my strings while I'm cuttin' 'em loose
I'd rather cut into you (Bleed!) for all the people starving
This is what we mean by trickle down economics
You're counting the commas found left at the decimal, I live within the decibel to find a higher conscious
Turn conflicts and convicts to convalescence
It's all dogma's, dog chains, and brand name depressants
We'll scare the messenger, but we'll kill the message
A truly brilliant man would learn to live with less shit
Preach my leftist perspective to the lame right wing, and when developments arrested then we'll finally find peace
Sit on top of the wave and think you see the whole sea, don't realize just below you lies 20,000 leagues
There's not enough ends to provide our means
The life. I hate you. The Mo-B. Peace

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Al-One]
I slave away day after day and put my dreams to the side
I got.. mortgage payments, my seeds almost 5
I've got everything that I need to survive, but corporate America's killing my soul make me believe in a lie
And I've got no reason to try.. to better myself.. but at least I'm a guy who'd reach for the skies.. and sever myself.. From all the bull shh that goes down around me. And believe me, all the bull shh that surrounds me ain't easy.. to block out, sometimes I want to walk out, and give it all up... like a boxer that's been knocked out
To count to 10, in my ears is like counselin'
The teachers in high school said I'd never amount to shh
And that's fuel to the fire. A person like you, could never have a clue why a person like me don't take it lightly, and what I'm gonna be is like... me

[Hook][Nas]
Aiyyo whassup Game
This the biggest boss in New York, Nas
Whattup my nigga I love what you doin out there man
New York got'chu, Queensbridge got'chu
Do the damn thing
We'll probably do some shit that'll scare the shit outta y'all
Nas y'all

[Verse One: M.O.B.]
Money Over Bitches, yeah
Watch it, when I hop out, 38 and a knockout
The studio on lockout like the day they let 'Pac out
Back to drop out, store the blockout
Homies say the cops out, stash spot got popped out
Grind 'til I clock out, tick tock out
Shake shakin them haters off, runnin a hot route
Get my Mike Williams on, homey do not doubt
#1 in Southern Cal', knowhatI'mtalkinbout?
Suckers up top on, shut 'em out of the pros
But runnin the fo'-fo' open them do's
Run and gun how I 'em them shows
When they see he can ball, let the cold flow open them hoes
I'm here, so go against my arrival is suicidal
Homicidal dynamic certifiedal my mob or die crew
You niggas been lied to, we the best that did it
Since Big was wit it and don't forget it (M.O.B.)

("It's the real..") Money Over Bitches, the new edition
("This.. is a DJ Ski exclusive")
("The real..") Money Over Bitches, and we the new edition
("Hip-Hop..")

[Verse Two: M.O.B.]
Yeah, yeah, it's the mob nigga, ha ha
Ay Tec I get these G-Unit niggas trippin
Talkin shit 'bout niggas like they can't come up missin
Ay look I'm here so you don't get the story twisted
When I catch him slippin I'ma gun him down homey pay attention
You niggas fin' to pay a visit, with readmission
What'chu know about cemetaries and morticians?
Know dat, can't run or escape like lo-jacks
With bullets that I aim cock spit and throw back
I'm Mr. Lemonhead on your block in a gold 'llac
Escaped from Death Row so stop askin where Suge at
You niggas need your minerals, vitamins, three chemicals
Lyrically invincible spittin repeated principles
I'm killin you, I ain't feelin you meanin a war
Cause when we mob through the door, e'rybody on the floor
It's the mob {*echoes*}M.O.B. - M.O.B. (Songtext)

[Hook]
Es ist M.O.B. so viel dopeness wie nie
Ey wie heißt dieser Junge, alle M.O.B
Es ist Mob dieser junge mit der Garantie
Dafür dass er diesen Scheiß und das Rapding liebt
Es ist M.O.B. so viel dopeness wie nie

[Part 1]
Es ist M.O.B., nenn mich M.O.B
Ganz egal was sie sagen es ist Mob das Genie
Denn er kommt und liefert ab so wie cro mit easy
Und im Handumdrehen rufen alle 'dope so wie nie'
Ja wer hätte es gedacht, er steht immer noch am mic
Und die Routine dabei -- hat Alan mir gezeigt
Zwar kein track verkauft, doch ne fanbase aufgebaut
Ja fast 70 Leuten gefällt meine Seite auch!

Es ist krass dieser hype, wie die Leute durchdrehen
Wenn sie mich und meine Möwenjungs im reallife erleben
Ey der er-ste gig war vor nun mehr gut nem Jahr
Alle Freunde waren da und man fühlte sich wie n star
War zwar krass nervös, hab mein' eigenen Part verchecked
Doch ich hab dabei auf jeden fall ne menge Blut geleckt
Dieses Hobby ist ne Strasse, eine endlose ja
Egal was alle sagen, es geht weiter, ouh jaah!

Ich liebe Hiphop ey no homo du Knecht
Raus aussem Schatten denn auch so bin ich fett
Und dann ab auf die Bühne dafür probe ich jetzt
Keine Aussicht mehr auf Cash oder Moos
Doch immer ne geile zeit dabei mit meinen bros!
Ganz egal was kommt, bin ganz vorn mit dabei
In der hook, als Backup oder einfach aus scheiß
Alles was ich brauch, ist ein Bier und ein mic
Wir Rappen nach dem Motto: Möwengang or die!
Schluss mit storrytelling wollte nur kurz erklären
Warum wir rappen und es auch in Zukunft werden
Immer weiter machen, bin von Reimen ein Fan
Damit bin ich STARK - so wie Iron man
Ey ich sage es, das wird n Hit na klar

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Game]
Life is what you make it sometimes I see blatant
Visions of Satan, I been smokin' hell of them marijuana vapors
With dreams of gettin' paper on felonious capers
Run a car for neighbors, bangin' The Best of Anita Baker
Now is that sacred? When niggas spend money on Jacob's
And it's that same shit that get blood spilled on the pavement
I'm patiently waitin', for God to open heaven' gates and
I'll take a knife in my heart before I murder my neighbor
And for that I'm hated, cause most of they rhymin' is basic
Dropped one album and left the whole world stuck in amazement
Started with Rakim, found him in my mom's basement
One demo tape and I'm on Em and Dr. Dre shit

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Techniec]
The 'hood got me feelin' like my back against the wall but I been here before
Let me fly or give me death, while I'm in here for dough
My pops used to hustle the corner in Lotto kicks
Attempt to try 'em on, didn't like that fit
Went after a record deal, shit I got that spit
Besides niggas ain't flyer than Tech at this shit
I'm a natural nigga, so it's only right to boss up
After these figures, so classical nigga
Had to document the avenue, study the set
Back to the OG's, create a new avenue nigga
So we could ride, rims spinnin' off the chrome
Check the rearview, Wave spittin' off the dome
Honey, the Westcoast is on

[Hook]Living here at the gates of hell
My body is a bombed out shell
Devoid of feeling, devoid of life
The only flame is a flicker in my eyes
Living here at the depths of pain
The sun is blacked out by the rain
That keeps on falling, as the blood keeps flowing
Lights at the end of the tunnel
At the gates of hell
Where the corpses yell
And the only sound
Is the toll of your death bells
Living here where the sun hits the streets
Peace flags flying in the breeze
Of illusion, a mirage in the desert
Lights at the end of the tunnel
At the gates of hell
Where the corpses yell
And the only sound
Is the toll of your death bells[Nas]
Aiyyo whassup Game
This the biggest boss in New York, Nas
Whattup my nigga I love what you doin out there man
New York got'chu, Queensbridge got'chu
Do the damn thing
We'll probably do some shit that'll scare the shit outta y'all
Nas y'all

[Verse One: M.O.B.]
Money Over Bitches, yeah
Watch it, when I hop out, 38 and a knockout
The studio on lockout like the day they let 'Pac out
Back to drop out, store the blockout
Homies say the cops out, stash spot got popped out
Grind 'til I clock out, tick tock out
Shake shakin them haters off, runnin a hot route
Get my Mike Williams on, homey do not doubt
#1 in Southern Cal', knowhatI'mtalkinbout?
Suckers up top on, shut 'em out of the pros
But runnin the fo'-fo' open them do's
Run and gun how I 'em them shows
When they see he can ball, let the cold flow open them hoes
I'm here, so go against my arrival is suicidal
Homicidal dynamic certifiedal my mob or die crew
You niggas been lied to, we the best that did it
Since Big was wit it and don't forget it (M.O.B.)

("It's the real..") Money Over Bitches, the new edition
("This.. is a DJ Ski exclusive")
("The real..") Money Over Bitches, and we the new edition
("Hip-Hop..")

[Verse Two: M.O.B.]
Yeah, yeah, it's the mob nigga, ha ha
Ay Tec I get these G-Unit niggas trippin
Talkin shit 'bout niggas like they can't come up missin
Ay look I'm here so you don't get the story twisted
When I catch him slippin I'ma gun him down homey pay attention
You niggas fin' to pay a visit, with readmission
What'chu know about cemetaries and morticians?
Know dat, can't run or escape like lo-jacks
With bullets that I aim cock spit and throw back
I'm Mr. Lemonhead on your block in a gold 'llac
Escaped from Death Row so stop askin where Suge at
You niggas need your minerals, vitamins, three chemicals
Lyrically invincible spittin repeated principles
I'm killin you, I ain't feelin you meanin a war
Cause when we mob through the door, e'rybody on the floor
It's the mob {*echoes*}[Verse 1]:

Whatchu' know about actually caring, Whatchu' know about actually staring
The future in its face, like I'm ready, that's what I do everyday, but i don't think that shit's apparent
I walk, what other just talk, I keep the shoes as a souvenir, if you could actually wear them, its my fault
For using heart, that's how I'm stepping ho, got a stethoscope if you could actually hear them
See Rawn so honest they have to compare him, to Ab Lincoln either that or put my raps in Aquarium
Cuz I'm wet, everybody riding, till i put up beside them, they dont know what they staring
Things change you don't know if you teaching or learning, the truth hearts, yeah it feel like im teaching a sermon
Im 100 as i creep the burner, tryna be the biggest thing out of Maryland, and its forever concerning, No Lie!

[Hook]:

Baby, Know I'm worth it, know i deserve it, though i ain't perfect
Yeah, But as long as we working, please don't tell me no lies
Yeah, Please don't tell me no lies

[Verse 2]:

Dont lie to me, not even if I receive
Its no point, I already prove I can read
Right through you, its like Voodoo, I stick in you, so just stick wit me
When you close your eyes, I wantchu to picture me, no photo's lets capture the bigger scene
As I hit the screen, it make me picture things, like walking out but I always hit the screen
I don't never finish, and maybe that's the problem, if I don't got I try it because its just an options
I done had a lot of babies, like adoption, I done heard a lot of maybe's still I'm watching
Everybody talking patience, well I got it, I'm a man under god, so i need a goddess
I'm saving, writing waivers, like I'm the copers, you got to do me no favors, just do me honors

[Hook]:

Baby, Know I'm worth it, know i deserve it, though i ain't perfect
Yeah, But as long as we working, please don't tell me no lies
Yeah, Please don't tell me no lies

Yeah, Please dont tell me no lies

[Verse 3]:

In any situation, in any shit you facing, honesty the key, that and participation
Love should never require solicitation, we all live with the desire that shit is basic
Rawn just one of the riders who need a placement, thinking over the top, but still stuck in the basement
Maybe if i ain't hear they'll see that they wasted, time of one of the greatest, god as created
Through these long days, and these slow nights, as im getting blazed, i hope it goes right
Bitch im going in, finna earn my stripes, and on the inside, tell me Lies

[Hook]:

Baby, Know I'm worth it, know i deserve it, though i ain't perfect
Yeah, But as long as we working, please don't tell me no lies
Yeah, Please don't tell me no lies[Verse 1: Ethic]
Now I haven’t had a bad life and I never really ever done dirt
And I don’t need no stress release to help relieve some pressure
I know that death is coming, know there’s no sense in running
I know myself and outside that I don’t need to know nothing
I keep a fuckin swagger, look at these suckers scatter
I know how to hold the mic right and speak like my substance matters
A cutthroat cadaver, condemned the jew of Nazareth
Followers for turning faith into a corporate ladder
I’ll give this hourglass a tip on its broken axis
And watch the sand drip through my fingers as I touch the masses
This is my open casket
Written down quotes and passages in blood
Spit from the lungs of a masochist

[Chorus: Mo-B]
War amongst men
Men amongst kings
Kings amongst God
God amongst all of us
Though we never fit the perfect picture, picture perfect peaceful
Peace at mind, we keep in mind, just to keep alive
X2

[Verse 2: Jon the Baptist]
Mistaken was I to ever think that one day
That these wings could take flight
I’m just a daydreamer drifting in the early twilight
I’ve broken down to rebuild
This so called life of mine and it’s so hard to find
Any reason to believe and to continue to fight
A decision that weighs heavy on my conscience at night
These vindictive addictions, they keep controlling my life
A hemophiliac juggeling knives until the blade hits
I know true anguish and I have been to the abyss
I lost one kid to the heavens and one to a money hungry bitch
Now I'm falling from the skies, like the wings of Icarus
There was bible and these bibles just try to make some sense
Of this life that I been living, giving a hundred and ten percent
It's very evident that you can’t break my will
It was forged in the heavens out of unbreakable steel
50 caliber Excalibur leaving holes in your shield

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: OnlyOne]
My own head is the end of me, when I’m dead you’ll remember me
With the horse's head to place inside the bed of my enemies
Life intends to be an illness so if death is the remedy
Perspective is kept, one last message left for the friends of me
I am dead from the step that disconnect a man's head from his neck
Being hateful and oppressed is my tendency
And now you tell me there are plenty other fish in the sea
Funny, they all look like a bunch of fucking bitches to me
You're living your live—that’s something to do
I live and I die—that’s nothing to you
Give in at night—that’s something to choose
Fuck with me, I got nothing to lose!
But I don’t think of depression when ears will ring in my presence
From what I bring to the session, become a King among peasants
Randomly candidly, killing family by family
It’s me in every thing, in every dream and every fantasy
The fans of me from land to sea know there’s not a man like me
It’s me in every thing, in every dream and every fantasy!

[Chorus]Raised in a prison with iron bars
And walls too high to be climbed
Raised in a four cornered corridor
Always kept silent and blind
Taught how to grow straight and upright
Taught how to love and obey
Taught how to speak when you're spoken to
And then taught what you can say
Throw into a job at a factory
Making money for those up above
Running and fetching and fetching and running
Slot into the job like a glove
Marry a boy from the factory
Whose dream was a girl like you
Running and fetching and fetching running
She was taught this was what she should do
Renting a house on the East Side of hell
With garden and wonderful view
Of kids playing war in the street after school
Who were taught this is what they should do
Watching the TV till hubby comes home
Unable to stand on his feet
Black and White pictures of policemen with sticks
Smashing f*ck out of kids on the street
Raised in a prison with iron bars
And walls to high to be climbed
Raised in a four cornered corridor
Always kept silent and blind[Intro: Vlad The Butcher]
Yeah baby you know
Being the generous motherfuckers that we are
We decided to give you some bonus tracks for that ass
But before we get into those
Got to let the world know to watch out for that
Illmac/OnlyOne coming soon, ya heard? Ya know I'm saying?
The only question now is who's gonna win that bidding war?
And put that shit out, yo that shit is yours homie, let's go

[Chorus: Mo-B]
Roll around wintertime with the windows down
Roll around wintertime with the windows down
Roll around wintertime with the windows down, ha ha ha ha, yeah
What's cracking pops, what's popping? We keep the people jumping
Red octagons up and leave when they see us coming
Roll around wintertime with the windows down
Roll around wintertime with the windows down
Roll around wintertime with the windows down, ha ha ha ha, yeah

[Verse: Illmaculate]
We hear a lot of talking, if you please come get some beef
You'll see your coffin dropping, six feet deep, now bitch retreat
We got them bottles popping, we're quick to drink some Hennessy
We popping Oxycotin, mixed with E, we thizz for weeks
And if you want some problems, sit and scheme and diss my team
Critics are like chickens and bitches ain't shit to me
We got those models jocking, and no I'm not from Compton
Wish it is popping off, let's hit the street, my clique is deep
We rolling windows down, we rolling Indo up
Don't try to give no pounds, in my town you'll get no love
And when some shit goes down, we quick to hit 'em up
When those fists come out you'll hit the ground and then we'll lift you up
You can't hang with the Sandpeeps, every track's lovely
You ain't making this band, you better ask Puffy
You see, Illmac's bummy
I'd date a chicken that's fat, chubby or mad ugly as long as she has money
Ask me if that's true? Ye-ye-ye-yeah yeah
Don't make me smack you like ye-ye-ye-yeah yeah
Call us a wack crew? You might get a brand new stab wound as a tattoo
Ye-ye-ye-yeah yeah...

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeah, you know I had to rock this beat for my mixtape, Al
Ya know what I'm saying? Put a verse on this heater
But um, y'all better check out that Al-One solo album
Coming soon, holla back surgery!Stubbing out progress where seeds are sown
Killing off anything that's not quite known
Sitting around in a nice, safe home
Waiting for the witch hunt

Idle plans for the idol rich
Knitting the economy, not dropping a stitch
Destroying anything that doesn't quite fit
Waiting for the witch hunt

Still living with the english fear
Waiting for the witch hunt, there
Always living with the english fear
Waiting for the witch hunt, there

Changing your course for another way
You better stop that or be willing to pay
Never mind son you'll come around some day
Under pressure from the witch huntLeft in the cafe, he sits all alone
This person with hopes that are so like my own
And nobody tells him as he's sitting there
He's dead long ago and nobody cares
Disgusted, demented, disillusioned, deranged
Mixed up, frustrated, you, youth
But I see a strange look on that face that's uncleaned
Its white bloodless color, now dull, once gleamed
And I know where I've seen that expression before
He's stood in the place where my feet touch the ground
The clock strikes 6 as I drink the last drop
Of the tea that's been sitting for hours in my cup
I think where to go now, the town has gone dead
And I realize I'm living this death
Disgusted, demented, disillusioned, deranged
Mixed up, frustrated, you, youth
