[Intro: Starlito]
TLC
Think laugh cry
Starlito

[Hook: Starlito]
Even though I haven't seen you lately
Want you to know that I appreciate you
Wish we were better at communicating
Either way your still my motivation

[Verse 1: Starlito]
I remember you told me to rap about love
Because that's the only thing that lasts forever
What you give a person that wants for nothing
Just know that you can ask for whatever
My last or whatever
I know it makes you happy to see me doing better
But I wrote this song instead of roses when your gone
I love you, had to tell you
And I still can't quite get passed my past
Living too fast
Many nights, long talks frustrated and sad
Blamin' my dad
I'd give everything all the change and the cash
Just to change up the crash
Just to lighten your load
Just like for you to know that I love your soul
Grand Momma

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Starlito]
I remember when you told me it's okay to cry
Lost Lil ??? and I lost my mind
Popped all them pills, thought I wanted to die
My darkest times taught me to shine
Just talked to my dog he partially blind
But his spirit's high and his heart is divine
I told him he motivate me
Said we grow up and grow ungrateful
And I know I be so impatient
Good things come to those who wait
I ain't believe you so I ain't wait
And I almost ain't make it
Kinda crazy, I wouldn't blame her if your Momma hates me
Chasin' these commas I'm a promise breaker
Solve our drama simple conversation
Now our problems complicated
I'm sorry I promise I'm the personification of guilt, regret
Gotta learn not to expect
Slowly learning how to accept
Still hoping for the best, it ain't over yet

[Hook]

[Outro: Starlito]
Real rap I might have shed a tear in 2000 writing this song
But ain't no shame in my pain
Might have just not have been this
Either way it had to come out one or another[Intro: Kevin Gates]
Dear Heavenly Father, I come to you seeking comfort in depressed times
This is a depressed time
Luca Brasi!

[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
Every rapper in the game'll say they sold cocaine
Never went to jail was
Never on no chain
Always throwing crosses that's what lil' hoes get
Claim to be a boss but you a lil' broke bitch
Reason you alive thank the niggas you run wit,
I was in a cell witchu and you ain't run shit
Told me put my shoes on, But
You ain't scratch
I wreck hall and jack off and then was so laid back
For niggas you would make calls, Don't that sound like draft
When I call a bitch in love she get here oh so fast,
Fucking right I read my bible, I believe in god
Yeah you punched me in my shit but you did not hit hard (laughs)

[Bridge]
I have respect for every man that demand your respect,
Nigga still alive, He lying if he said he checked me
Rather stand alone before I pull a nigga dick
All you pussy rappers just be pulling niggas dick (ya bitch)

[Hook]
Behind my name I'm standing tall and will die any day
As I grew wise I thought that I would put that foolish pride away
If you cross can't take a loss, I can't walk away (I can't)
There's no way in hell I'd ever let you walk away

[Verse 2: Starlito]
R-E-S-P-E-C-T this heat, I keep that Glock with me
Caught two pistol charges still got my L's and reciprocity
Never be a celebrity, all this beef where the broccoli
I'm obviously not wrapped to tightly, You probably better off offing me
A nigga better watch how he talk to me, Like how I watch how I talk on my cell
Don't answer my phone from rap niggas, I get calls way more often from jail (hello)
Swear it was so hot out on my block we all thought it was hell
On the L's, sippin' syrup tryna mend this broken heart from all the betrayal
Sold it before it got off the scale, Re-up and do it again
Shot it out so many times, Got to see who was truly my friends
I was one deep in deep thought
Thinking everybody tryna con or cross me
It's getting hard to be humble tryna get this bad karma off me
Starlito!

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kevin Gates]
I just aim the Smithn' 22 and win me 14-6
If I lost you with the multiple you don't know shit
16 through 52's you got you 4 bricks
But it probably was in vein, Cause you won't score shit
Brugh talk about me bad, I'm like not my boy
When I got his bitch pregnant bet it broke his heart
Gone ahead and get some get back or fuck my bitch
I'll let you in on a lil' secret nigga she not shit,
First ole' lady crushed my feelings, I ain't been hurt since
Whole family full of gangstas and we both know this,
If a sucker run up on me he can get bent up,
Hold it down for my real niggas still penned up, Luca Brasi!![Intro: Starlito]
Shit
Introversion
Hood Rich

[Verse 1: Starlito]
It's a thin line between joy and pain
Momma smiling, the sun shining but I'm enjoying the rain
Drowning my sorrows by pouring up drank
Down on myself with no one to complain to
Getting this change but I'm going insane too
Cause' everyone changed even though I'm the same dude
Throw em' some change if you don't they gonna blame you
Never wanted the fame cause' I know what the fame do
The game cruel, all my comrades confined
I prefer solitude I'm out my mind half the time
Drug habit gravity defined, still a survivor turned tragedy to triumph
Made the most out the least and flipped the ten fold
Spoke to the code of the streets seen many men fold
Money got long so I got extendos
She wants to know whats wrong, I'm about to implode

[Chorus: Robin Raynelle
Feel like somethings different, whats wrong
Tell me Why you never pick up the phone
Maybe I should leave you alone
And let you work it out on your own

[Verse 2: Starlito
Keep reading my partners paperwork over and over
Just poured a four in my soda
Now I ain't know when it's over
Late nights from a lonely day and you got no one to hold ya
Now its time to go hit the stage I'm trying to hold my composure
So throwed did my last show with a toaster
All the ups and the downs I'm rolling I'm coasting I'm loaded but I'm focused yeah
Don't know if you know this but I don't know who gonna be there
When the going gets tough I'm the one who ain't going no where
Dolo blowing dro in the air , well you know how I go anywhere
Man I be trying tell these young niggas
Try to live my rhymes you gonna wind up in a  chair
I just hope you don't die from kidney failure
I just know you gonna hold down your niggas forever

[Chorus]Black Sheep Don't Grin...they cry

Deleted all my texts from my ex before I went home
Nothing to hide but trust subsides when you been gone
I paid rent lights cable and her Sprint phone
Did all I could for her except left her alone
I'm no good and I know it
So hood and I show it
All my smiles turn stoic so I wrote it, a poet
Hold up, does that make this poetic?
And if i don't regret it, does that make me pathetic?
Knew better and did lesser
I don't deserve much credit
I know it's gonna hurt her and what's worse I just accept it
(These are my confessions)
I ain't supposed to be so reckless, I just hope that she ain't notice those emojis in that message (hold on)

(at least let me tell you why I'm this way, you don't understand.  no one understands.)

And now i'm messing with a married woman, sneakin' and freakin'
My conscience got my tweakin' from an evening last weekend
Say, I give her what she need and it don't matter how infrequent
She know about my girl so what we have's our little secret
Yeah I peeped that I unleash her inner freak, with me she can be indecent
When you're cheating it always feel like you're on defense
And I've been "impreeving" as a reason and accept the text messages her eyes wide as she received it
I said "hold up, why you leaving?"
She said "Oh, I got my reasons
"My friends tried to tell me you weren't shit, but seeing is believing."
Now, looks can be deceiving
Cause I'm the one standing here grieving, guess we even

(you don't understand.  no one understands...)[Intro]

Yeo!![Verse 1: Starlito]
Last seen ridin' clean with some dealer plates
Fuckin' up this rap money on lean, guns and real estate
Just got a Rolex watch, I had to take a link up out it
Take a drink, I'm drowsy
How much paper you think I'm countin'?
I just split a pound four ways to make a single thousand
My little round'll shoot you in the face...
Got a Rolex watch, I had to take a link up out it
Take a drink, I'm drowsy
How much paper you think I'm countin'?
I just split a pound four ways to make a single thousand
My little round'll shoot you in the face and he ain't gon' think about it, whoa
I'm tryin' to stop the violence
I'm buyin' a Glock with a silence
You cheap in your vehicles, at least you tryin' to watch the mileage
I'm countin' this fettucine, thinkin' "why was I in college?"
A lot of niggas dissed me that I'll probably not acknowledge
We got homicide or hobbies
Got no problem catchin' bodies
I keep riders all around me
They just wanna see me prosper
All my shows like choir rehearsal, I'm here to preach the gospel
All my hoes be lyin', they worsesome
All I know is grind, keep workin'

[Hook: Starlito]
If you ain't get no check, then I ain't checkin' for ya
Want this around my neck, I got that FN for ya
If you ain't gettin' no money, she won't answer for ya
Won't pay these hoes no mind, too busy payin' my mortgage
And these lawyers
Payin'[???]
[???]
[???]
Used to stand on corners, hand to hand with quarters
Now we get it transported

[Verse 2: Starlito]
Stash box in my whip, that bitch a transformer
And I'm important, so my people imported
Yeah, my last show, I fucked around, got ten for it
And according to my calender, got ten more
Play with me, you don't know what you in for
Still a pull up in the 'hood like what you hidden for
Pull out, catch my plug, he waitin' at the liquor store
Cried a thug tear yesterday, yeah, cause they picked up Roy
Damn, I got 20 mouths to feed, plenty people countin' on me
I'm grouchy once I down the lean
I smoked a quarter pound this week
I'm movin' weight, still out of shape
My newest place is out of state
All these hoes, they out of pocket
All these suckers gotta pay
Been down that road before, so I know goin' broke is not OK
I done pulled up out at eight, noddin' but I'm wide awake
I'll put her on a plane, and I'll put her out for playin'
Hell nah, I'm not gon' change, even though I got some change

[Hook: Starlito]
If you ain't get no check, then I ain't checkin' for ya
Want this around my neck, I got that [?] for ya
If you ain't gettin' no money, she won't answer for ya
Won't pay these hoes no mind, too busy payin' my mortgage
And these lawyers
Payin'[???]
[???]
[???]
Used to stand on corners, hand to hand with quarters
Now we get it transported[Verse 1: Starlito]
I spent most of my twenties with a 30-round clip
I spent most of my twenties and I stashed the hundreds
You gotta warrant that ain't caught ya yet and keep running
I heard it all but won't repeat nothin'
I'm thuggin', I'm grindin', tryna get that check
Phone ringing off the hook blame it on this connect
You might get finessed, tell you no disrespect
Gave em all ones, got it from the stripper (bitch)
I ain't stressin', I ain't stresin', I ain't stressin'
I count the rest of this money when I finish countin' my blessings
You fucked up bout that bitch, I'm thinkin' bout her best friend
I'm guessin' that she restin', I just left her at the Western
She gave me a massage while you was sendin' text messages
She think she Nicki Minaj, I walk in my garage, I talk to all my cars
I load up all my guns and I ain't thought about tomorrow

[Hook: Starlito]
Don't do it, don't do it (don't do it)
I'm goin' through it (x4)

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
His big brother threw a cross cause he was mad about a bitch I was fuckin'
You can't control no pussy spared your wife you know how I'm comin'
Cali your boy pull up with chaotic and then go to dumpin'
I'm from where heroin bumpin', gum bumpin' we bump ya
Let loose and flush you then trunk you
Gangsta how I be comin'
Offset some Porsches get at me
I know you bitches can't stand me
One thang I love bout the game, you can't get stripes from pretending
I take shots, be shooting shit but don't no names'll get mentioned
Pussy bite then he fishin'
Or might be in they feelings
Talkin' shit bout guerrillas, then you might swim with the fishes
Before Gucci went to jail these other rappers was timid
He got his time, they poke they head out, now they talk like they killers
Criminal-minded all on Instagram, in public pretenders
I wish somebody would challenge me, was born a contender
Louisiana, no flex zone, we stay bout our business
Ridin' all through East Atlanta without tint on the windows

[Hook: Starlito][Starlito Speaking]
A whole lot of times, I just be up;
Middle of the night, overnight, early mornings
Just reading..

[Verse 1: Starlito]

Feel like we slaves, thugging, risking our freedom for whips and chains
Used to want fame, along the way the mission changed
Need a physician's signature and prescription to fix this pain
Just listen, this isn't in vain, I'm really just giving game
To you lame brains, stay in your lane, show some restraint
It's real out here, I'm chilling, but they still out here dealing 'caine
Niggas telling, not to mention, they'll kill you for anything
Man, racism on the regular
I'm having strange feelings I'm being traced off of my cellular
You got these fuck niggas, fake niggas, et cetera
It's getting to the point that I hate niggas, I'm tellin' ya
Hoes too, they'll side track ya, eye-catchers
Just a distraction, so I fuck them hoes and say "bye" after
Yeah, fuck them hoes, you can have that bitch in a scouts honor
Told my accountant, I'm counting on her, trying to get this account a new comma
Praying hard that these rap fans respect the real
Record deal on schedule, Grinding Hard, I never chill
They better chill and appreciate that I let 'em live
This my seventh pill, I can't let up off of these sedatives
That's a lie, I just figured you like your rappers high
Or incoherent, as drunk as I was on Trap or Die
I'm on that Grey Goose, do I know you?
Aw, you know me, and that's so cool. LITO

You ain't gotta hold my hand, just point me to the money...

Sometimes I wonder why like Jadakiss
How y'all let the fakest shit become y'all favorite
I ain't taking shots, I'm just taking sips
You don't know about them big boys taking pics, seizing homes, taking whips
This what major fascination with that paper gets
Wonder why they fabricate it, man, cause y'all fascinated with that made up shit
Latest lady, the one you know you wanna lay up with
Wonder why I just put her to sleep and stay awake and dip
I'm gone, gone, my mind elsewhere, I need some health care
Bustin' five figure checks, but still think like I'm broke
Throwed off and I know it, I like drinking my dope
Nod off, wake up, like I ain't blinking no more
Naw, I ain't blinking, I'm drinking a dark orange Mountain Dew
Trying to cash in on my passion, feel like a abacus they all counting on you
What you gon' do, if you only knew
No crutches, no kneeling, and I'm on my own two
Heart crushed, got no feelings, violence we prone to
Wonder why I been on this grind so long, man, I don't know, do you?
I don't know much of nothing, but what I won't do
That's snitch, quit or submit, you don't know what I'm going through
You don't even know it, cause you don't need to know it
She wonder why I always look so tired
These niggas sour and I wonder why I always be so quiet[eminem sample]
Whats the difference me and you?
So whats the difference between us?
We can start at the penis
Or we can just scream i just dont give a fuck
And see who means it

[Lito]
Too much to life
Im just tryna make a difference
Workin with a quarter brick tryna make a difference
I feel you

LITO

I was up all night countin 5s and 10s, grind hard
I really mean it like the diplomats
In fact i'll say that one mo gain
I was up all night countin 5s and 10s
With a bleach blonde gettin faded
Pullin up in he projects shoot 20 bend 80
If i front it better pay me
Never front it if i pulled it then i pop it
[?] tryna keep my name out them papers
Every time i get ready to drop a tape, it feel like the first time
And i remember it like it was yesterday
He skipped better than shine

Everybody else was goin to sleep, i stayed up til bout 9
That was 03, still in that same shit i made up my mind
I quit school, told my family pray for me im on my grind
10 years later, same thing just pray for me im on my grind
Early this mornin cried tears of joy
I feel its reasonable to be emotional
Im happy to be alive, never been shot
But i came close tho
Young nigga shit from he don know, but i got an old soul
Young nigga shit form he don know
Hold up

Came the long way from takin the long way home
Ridin circles round my home, now i get surveillance on my phone
Im Al Capone you Al Pacino you just play yo role
Real niggas vouch for me cause im bout my c notes now ya know
Just counted 1000 and smilin as i count 1000 mo
Tryna get a thousand thousands out this dope house fo i go
Woah!

Rule number 1 get money and if we got to well take some
Just take nothin for granted, cause they comin
When you least expect it better keep ya weapon
Keep on grindin
Keep on grindin
Thats what i keep on tellin myself
I mean why are my people stressin
Up or down
Right or wrong
The same people present
GRIND HARD

I got some west coast homies that dont fool with that mailbox
Be at a loss for words, i dont have nothin to tell cops
My bitch think she Rihanna when i drop her off at the nail shop
Got half the guns on black ops
Quick to shoot cause im shell shocked
Used to hang on the L block
So we like why the hell not
The streets so fucked up a nigga get outta jail hot
Dope in a jelly jar, yeah gotta baby food
Drank out a baby bottle, nigga play me i make the news

Who? Lito lito lito lito lito

Me and you
Difference between me and you
Is i really ain't thinkin bout you

Yeah, and to tell you the truth
I can't wait for me to drop something new

LITO

Attention, tithes, and taxes

Cold turkey july 4th
Step brothers 2 right after that[Verse 1: Starlito]

Mail box full of bills
My partners in the cell locked with no appeal
Mind gone from the dro and pills
Grinding up on 150 in 2012 with no deal
Threw half a hundred on four wheels
Three times over like im trying to show the ville
Like I got a point to prove
Might catch me in lolo still
With a stash spot you could put a brick like O'Neal
Play that block niggas shooting close range
Fuck you mean no hoop dream we stuck in the dope game
Codeine, lortab, cocaine, OC's, percocets, mdma for the pain
Xanax, crystal meth, heroin anything for the change
Just like money making Mitch the hustlers in our veins
When money make you snitch they need to get out the game
Shouldn't nothing make you snitch you need to get out the game
Quit cold turkey

[Chrous]

Man this shit ain't for everybody
I swear everything ain't for everybody
She don't care about you, she just want some red bottoms
Thought it was your partner till the feds caught him
This shit ain't for everybody
Na everything ain't for everybody
She don't care about you, she just want some red bottoms (red bottoms)
Thought it was your partner till the feds got him

[Verse 2: Starlito]

The other day I walked in the bank with my pistol on me, bad habits
And I probably would've robbed them if it was an automatic
Thought about it, like man you too hot, and I started laughing
You know I wear the gun like my seat belt when I’m in traffic, strapped
I ain’t bragging, I ain’t just rapping, I quit drinking if I ain’t celebrating
I’m focused and active, I’m just investing my all
Who knows whats going to happen
Just trying not to get trapped in trapping
That steal on my lap ya, I’m out here grinding for the stacks man
Fuck a pack I book myself and get back off the back end
Ya this the renaissance of that G shit peep this
Realist shit I’ve ever done was staying free shit
Plant seeds when I was giving away that free shit
Eighty twenty split ya guess you see tree bitch
I’m from the streets so it’s always going to be street shit
But this is just my exit strategy we all need to quit

[Chrous]

[Verse 3: Starlito]

Ya this real street shit ain’t for everybody
Everybody was his partner till the feds got him
I know some boys in the hood that’ll head shot him
Just to say you want to see a dead body?
A couple of my partners overseas oughta be in the league
A few more overseas fighting the war for the powers that be
No, I don’t believe this how we dreamed it
But at least they see its more than life than these streets
Might as well spread your wings and fly free
If I knew what I know now I’d been Ivy League
Or play ball somewhere small and dribbled up on a degree or three
Might have even got a PHD I ain’t tripping
Trip ain’t Lito but together we
Already damn near completed that step brothers 3
I’m just planning my work and working my plan
Cause whats ahead of me
Got me looking forward to never looking back, a better me

LITO

Cold Turkey

Shit ain't for everybody
Na everything ain't for everybody

[Chrous]Intro:
Really I just wanted to do it cause they told me I couldn't
"you went from A-Z I bet you can't go from Z-A"

[Verse 1:Z-A]
I'mma start with Z.Y? cause I was on the "X"
Last night at the "W" I almost fucked my Ex, and
That be the worst but sometimes that be the best
Get on the "V" and tell her to undress!
Like I'm talkin to "U" you in the green dress
My Iced-out piece the size of Joe's T.S
Hundred thousand dollar car, yeah she know who I "R"
My nigga "Q" strapped they be breakin down the gar
I'm hot I can't smoke, gotta see my P.O
Roy and them [N-M] got the "L" look like 1994
The "K" in the bushes, the neighbors keep lookin
For the "Js" their cookin, the police crooked
"I" swear I ball like an under payed rookie, for real
I got 500 pills meet me at "H.G". Hills,
They scoopin niggas up yes indeed
Couple partners of mines just went "F.E.D"
That's why I keep tellin "C" to "B" careful "A"
I'm cold my momma say I'm special
Man I keep tellin Ed be careful
Sons need fathers be an uncle to your nephews god bless you

[Verse 2:A-Z]
I was like "A" I ain't the nigga you wana "B"
Cause you don't understand what you can't "C"
I sold "D" sold "E" but "F" it I'm still a "G"
Used to get H.I. back when I was 18,
Servin the "Js" had to get me a "K"
Back when I was on the "L" it could go down any day,
I went to college but no! I ain't get a degree
See I figured rap music was the route for me
Went to the "M, holla'd at gotti cause he heard my CD
Ended up in the N.O. but I wasn't with "P"
That was my "Q" I'm like
Man I don't care who you are
I bet you ain't fuckin with S.T.A.R. nah
You might of had too many U.V. rays
You can "W" I mean clone yourself and lose 3 ways
What you on X or something, what is you high?
I'm finished "Y" cause I'm at "Z" bye!

[Bridge}
I'm Starlito no, no there's no equal...
No saccharin, no Nutrisweet
I'mma show you the difference between you and me

[Verse 3]
I A-M the man
Even if I was spittin iambic pentameter
You can't deter my path
"A bend in the road is not the end of the road"
I just laugh, I can take a money bath
I don't conversate with rats... but I just want the cheese
So I'll kill you to make sure I eat capisce...
"oh" you can call me gangster
But I do not associate with none of you wanksters
Pranksters ain't you? they say I can't freestyle
Why should I when they pay me like 10 Gs now?
For every verse that I write, every verse I recite
Every show I perform, its like every other night

[Outro]
You try to cut off my pockets... my math book got all it fuckin pages I expect you to hate meAlright all right (x5)
McVegas
This is precicely the kind of hype that i'm about

And i'm on it (burn one)

Im so high of the life
Im gonna need Some dro to help me come down tonight
Im gonna need a ho but where I’m from we call them flights
I prefer them light bright

Im so high of the life
Im gonna need Some dro to help me come down tonight
Im gonna need a ho but where I’m from we call them flights
I prefer them light bright

Wa -la!! I’m so throwed, i Went through my phone and called all my hoes
When on the pill anything goes
You know me i never trick my hoes
Don't indulge in what i sold
And that's why i stop selling Dro
Still got the pints for the low
Hey shawty stop at the store (to get a sprite)
She's like Starlito slow mo
[?]
Just my numb cocaine flow, she goes dumb with the brains oh [?]
I think she wanna fuck my clean Benz, say if its cool can she bring a friend
2 on 1 handicap match, three way like a Chris [?]

Im so high of the life
Im gonna need Some dro to help me come down tonight
Im gonna need a ho but where I’m from we call them flights
I prefer them light bright
X2

So fly I'm on autopilot, so high i don't know how I'm driving
When i get dressed i boost my sky mileage, and all the rappers wan't my stylist, I'm one of a kind my style is, probably the same reason the girl smilin

You don't do what? girl you childish., im droppin you back off, don't worry bout it
She went from hard to get, to gettin it hard
And they hardly ever get to Star
Want me to pay for her pedicure, I'm like ok whatever sure
Knowing good and well ion like feet
Open minded girls I like freaks
Specially the ones that like me, same night I'm on flight three

Im so high of the life
Im gonna need Some dro to help me come down tonight
Im gonna need a ho but where I’m from we call them flights
I prefer them light bright
X2

I prefer a fast car and drive slow
Smoke back to back until my eyes glow
Star in the game [?] no less survival, middle finger to the five' o
[?]
Just evidence that i gettin rent
Black leather mess my Jordans, she treats me better than her boyfriend
She says he's jealous and i see why, i understand you've got too lean back
She in love and I'm not even tryin, i ain't givin up no DNA for the CSI
No sprinklers could extinguish that, [?] purple rain in this weed fire? [?]
Attempted murder yet a decent try, but i keep my burner ain't no need to die
Not tonight

Im so high of the life
Im gonna need Some dro to help me come down tonight
Im gonna need a ho but where I’m from we call them flights
I prefer them light bright

It's Lito
It's Lito
And im on it(Starlito)
I was 'bout to cop the Porsche, had no one to sign for the Panamera
Still blew half a hunnid (racks), Forgi's on that black Camera
Tell me where to meet, I'm coming with a trash bag
Got a pound beside me right now, no hash tag
But if the topic is gwap, well lets chop it up, and make it a trend
I'm so high I'm seeing double, on a double date with twins
So that's 4 hoes in in this 4x4, double cup on a double stack
I'm twice as real you twice as fake so I just bought another strap
Told you I'm throwed off
Sippin on that school zone my apologies I dozed off
Oh, ok, I'm reloaded
Fired my new ho, she remind me of my old bitch
The last 2 weeks I made 30 racks, still reminds me of a whole brick
I've been gettin' so much gwap I forgot how to fold it
No shit
So many shows they think we got them bricks again
Or Chino got a shipment in
Or Elroy hit a lick for 10
Same crew
Wonder if you let that money change you
Or numb you, and go to your brain the same way the cocaine do
I hear these little lame dudes sayin' the same shit knowin' it ain't true
My niggas in halfway houses and got bracelets on their ankles
My other homies in college and I'm sure they feel my pain too
Had a dream like Dr. King and damn, it damn near came true
If you order 1 1/2, I might bring 2 when I came through
We heavy nigga!, In the lab right now with a bad bitch, a jar and some drank too
More of a Carlito then a Tony Montana
U might think I'm a handyman how I'm holdin' my hammer (retarded)
Fly nigga, yea I got my pistol
And if any of them pussies think they tough, they more than welcome to die wit you
Bullets at yo chest, Joe Montana
Who shoot 'em, how the fuck should I know? I was in Atlanta
At the 12, pourin' a 12 in a 3 liter Fanta
Got the mids goin' for 12, I sold 12 in the Panarama
Rode through Haynes Manor, the police hot as ever, I can't stand them
Its like money don't even matter, these niggas shootin' over bandannas
The West Side is still greivin', matter a fact, the Ville greivin'
Rest in peace Lil Bo, Lil Sammie, Skeet and that's how I'mma leave it (gone)[Intro: Starlito]

We gone free Big Guy & Red Dot on this one

[Verse 1: Starlito]

Them niggas ain't us, that's the same reason they hating
I'm just like you my nigga, only difference I'm not waiting on nobody for nothing,
Either they riding or it's fuck em! I promise all I think about is
Pussy & money, that's my influence, I do what the fuck I want
When I want to do it, Real ass nigga dawg don't even mention my music
I advise only the real ride to it, they try but I do it,
Oh, I ain't introduce myself my bad, It's Lito
I do it bigger they the iPhone I'm the iPad
Once i shoot this bitch off a tripod, can't stop the bleeding
Better try a pad.... ol' pussy ass nigga
I could've been done through my life away, I guess God spared me
I'm rapping with hell's fury, ain't none of this imaginary
I'm at war with myself, so nigga fuck you I'm at war with myself
Idk what to do, I'm at war with myself

[Inerlude: Starlito]

Before I go any further, let me ask you this
What satisfies you, what would you be satisfied by?
I mean i've given my best, had sat on
Spit back, as if it wasn't my original thought
I mean the streets held my mind captive for so long
It don't matter what label you place on me
Gifted, goofy, whatever, I'm bold I'm honest
This just how I solve it, I'm gone rap
I'm gone get back to that,Cause that's what I'm here for
Right now, but.. b-but i hope you find you a purpose
Cause it's a lot of motherfuckers that's lost
& I say that meaning not knowing where they going
& not winning even by Charlie Sheen standards
I get high, but sometimes (Nigga Fuck You) other times I get even lower

[Verse 2: Starlito]
I wake up grab the tool, before I hit the snooze, Rather be on MTV
Shidd I done did the news, guess we was never cool,don't get this shit confused
Don't want to fit in your shoes, if it's little me & bigger you
That's fine, i was still riding, i was just trying to get what was mine
Wish niggas stop lying , cause my niggas keep dying
& the way the state been giving out time, to a nigga that's rich
Ain't gotta touch shit, I ain't gotta touch shit
Might not mean nothing, but I'm living out my rhymes, forget it I resign
In just they print it I ain't say resign...
Niggas might not owe me nothing, but until the rap game show me different I'm fine
Look I ain't gotta rhyme, & I don't give a fuck if I ain't gotta dime
I ain't gotta stand in line, got the kind of talent you should be trying to sign
Not trying to rob, & if I'm not unsigned then it's a glitch in the matrix
& I don't wanna talk, & to my nigga Red Dot fuck it, I'm going off
I'm at war with myself,I'm at war with myself.. (think i give a fuck about you)[Verse 1: Dee-1]
Robin Williams died
Committed suicide
Three weeks later my friend dead
Now it’s just the crew and I
Sitting ‘round wondering what happen
Guess it’s foolish pride
Thinking it can’t happen to one of us
No not you and I
Who am I
Miss the funeral cause I feel poor inside
I been battling my own demons
Ain’t no new surprise
Contemplated driving off the road in my newest ride
Same fate as Robin
Different route like 3 and 4 , 2 and 5
Both equal seven
Tell your reverend that my heaven sure ain’t here on earth
Money, fame what it’s worth
When you’re in the dirt
So what I ain’t in the dirt
Sunday I was in the church
Saturday I was… man I ain’t putting that in this verse
They judge me and love me
Hug me and mug me
God is good
That broad is bad
Most of all this world is ugly
Going on vacation
Mentally I need sedation
Pray for me
I see you at the final destination

[Hook: Dee-1 and (Starlito)]
Hesitation leads to frustration
It got me pacing
Round and round and round in this basement
My mind racing
Life ain’t no erasing
This reality we facing  (No patience and the lack of cash)
That’s a bad combination (She want more and that’s all he had)
That’s a bad combination ( Thugging, druging)
That’s a bad combination (She love him, he doesn’t)
That’s a bad combination (All bad)
That’s a bad combination

[Talking: Starlito]
Ain’t no shame in my game
I just (you know)
I want somebody to do better or be better

[Verse 2: Starlito]
Bad Combination
They got different expectations
Money been funny lately
Mix that with impatience
His ol’ lady late
The last thing they need is a baby
Lust turns into hatred
Next it’s child support payment
It happens every day like this battle I have with satan
They might just decapitate all the rappers with education
Wouldn’t surprise me
They want us blind
I see the signs
The unique should unify
Wish the real would realize
I need more resistence the harder I grind
Can’t let it break my will
You smoke weed or sip lean
That don’t make you real
Survivors guilt
I won’t sell my soul
I still pay the bills
And once I peak I might disappear like Dave Chappelle
That’s just how I feel
Two days ago I made bail
And I making up for lost time
Trying to make it where I can’t fail
Pistol and a sack
That’s a bad combination
Felony situation
I’m just telling what I’m facing
Man it’s crazy

[Hook][Produced by BandPlay]

[Hook – Starlito][x2]
I'm ballin ballin ballin bitch
Don't know what else to call this shit
All this gualas I brought with me, I fuck around and spend all this shit
I fuck around spend all this shit, I'm ballin ballin ballin bitch
I fuck around spend all this shit

[Verse 1 – Starlito]
I started off fucked up, finally got my weight up
Still trying to figure out what the fuck you hating for
When I come around it feel just like an appraisal
Independent nigga getting it in just like the majors
Thumbing through the checks feel like a nigga turning pages
If you was cool and ain't no more, you've done us both a favor
Eighties baby, grew up on a pistol and a pager
Got a free quarter ounce, I bet a hundred on the Lakers
I should say against them, you know I'm riding with the Heat
At the corner store with my box Chevy
Box of rubbers, box of swisher sweets
Still got a bitch that got a bitch that'll get your bitch to leave
Switch up freaks like I swap my whips, that shit ain't real as shit to me

[Hook][x2]

[Verse 2 – Juicy J]
I get to the money partner, you too broke to talk to me
I been counting up all this week, on top of my shit like a toilet seat
I’m rich just like I oughta be, and being real don’t cost a fee
Tell your girl come ride with me
Dick buffet, all she can eat
Loud pack in a mason jar, drive slow in a race car
This yellow bitch I’m in traffic with
She fine as shit and she paid for
Nah this ho can’t be my wife, just make sure you roll my weed up right
Made my eyes so low, it looks like I’m gonna cook me fried rice
I’m ballin, ballin, ballin, bitch
In a car that costs like 40 bricks
Bought a case of sprite and Imma pour codeine in all this shit
These niggas ain’t trill, these niggas policing on the low
Take a nigga’s bitch, and leave the club
But he can put an APP on that ho

[Verse 3 – Kevin Gates]
Screeching, no reason
Saved by the bell, this bitch to the right
Pretty face, tall, white, with a smile like Lisa
Big booty diva
Broke a brick down, need a band of zap
And three hundred for the O’s of reefer
Twenty five bags of the OG kush and the grandaddy purp come weekly
Xans and tabs in the air, no slab, but thank god for my people
On the road doing show after show after show and I still eat good off features
Clunking, gold, and tweaking if the streets ain't got no lean
Say they bought like nine 50 for the seal I say I need it
Took time, this crook’s fine, had bad karma, I shook mine
Jab good, slip excellent, uppercuts, my hook's fine
Refrigeration, illustration, ice on, got niggas hating
Foreign whip, foreign bitch, what that is, immigration
Overcooked dope bags cocaine
If it cook too long then they may complain
Dope game both lanes, won't say no names
Don’t make propane, won't make no change
From the ghetto [?] work that's why I'm ballin, I'm ballin
If you've got a problem with it I ain't sorry, I ain't sorry

[Hook][x2][Produced by Ryan Hemsworth]

[Talking]
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know
Might be too personal. Might be too personal. Might be too personal
I don't know. It's over. Just personality
Ahhhh!

[Hook]
I think about you all the the time
No, I can't get you off my mind (I can't get you off my mind)
But you can't get me off my grind
I can't get over you
But you can't get me off my grind
I'm so in love with you...

[Verse 1]
This much is true...
No matter what I do or where I go
I see your face, hallucinate
Meet a stranger, call her your name
I feel this way, I'm not ashamed
My selfish ways are all to blame
I swear I was so full of shit
Played so many games, I'm in the hall of fame
I'm lonely
Need company
Miserable
It's all the same
I tried to call, your number changed
I told you, I was gonna change
Should've gave her four letters
TIME, LOVE, a NAME
I tried to call, your number changed
I told you, I was gonna change

[Hook] 2x
I think about you all the the time
No, I can't get you off my mind (I can't get you off my mind)
But you can't get me off my grind
I can't get over you
But you can't get me off my grind
I'm so in love with you...

[Verse 2]
I think about you when I'm out'chere
Grinding, tryna find myself
I think about the times you tried to help
Still wound up by myself
Forgot about the way I truly felt
Because I was overwhelmed
I'm moving on with no regrets
That U-Haul truck ain't showed up yet
Can't get over it
And what's worse I can't control it
She say we just friends
That ain't enough
Things just ain't the same no more
This feeling's unexplainable
This picture had to get painted though
And I could only used the color blue
What should I do?
What would you do?

[Hook] 2x
I think about you all the the time
No, I can't get you off my mind (I can't get you off my mind)
But you can't get me off my grind
I can't get over you
But you can't get me off my grind
I'm so in love with you...


I'm so in love with you...[Verse 1: Starlito]
Last seen ridin' clean with some dealer plates
Fuckin' up this rap money on lean, guns and real estate
Just got a Rolex watch, I had to take a link up out it
Take a drink, I'm drowsy
How much paper you think I'm countin'?
I just split a pound four ways to make a single thousand
My little round'll shoot you in the face...
Got a Rolex watch, I had to take a link up out it
Take a drink, I'm drowsy
How much paper you think I'm countin'?
I just split a pound four ways to make a single thousand
My little round'll shoot you in the face and he ain't gon' think about it, whoa
I'm tryin' to stop the violence
I'm buyin' a Glock with a silence
You cheap in your vehicles, at least you tryin' to watch the mileage
I'm countin' this fettucine, thinkin' "why was I in college?"
A lot of niggas dissed me that I'll probably not acknowledge
We got homicide or hobbies
Got no problem catchin' bodies
I keep riders all around me
They just wanna see me prosper
All my shows like choir rehearsal, I'm here to preach the gospel
All my hoes be lyin', they worsesome
All I know is grind, keep workin'

[Hook: Starlito]
If you ain't get no check, then I ain't checkin' for ya
Want this around my neck, I got that FN for ya
If you ain't gettin' no money, she won't answer for ya
Won't pay these hoes no mind, too busy payin' my mortgage
And these lawyers
Payin'[???]
[???]
[???]
Used to stand on corners, hand to hand with quarters
Now we get it transported

[Verse 2: Starlito]
Stash box in my whip, that bitch a transformer
And I'm important, so my people imported
Yeah, my last show, I fucked around, got ten for it
And according to my calender, got ten more
Play with me, you don't know what you in for
Still a pull up in the 'hood like what you hidden for
Pull out, catch my plug, he waitin' at the liquor store
Cried a thug tear yesterday, yeah, cause they picked up Roy
Damn, I got 20 mouths to feed, plenty people countin' on me
I'm grouchy once I down the lean
I smoked a quarter pound this week
I'm movin' weight, still out of shape
My newest place is out of state
All these hoes, they out of pocket
All these suckers gotta pay
Been down that road before, so I know goin' broke is not OK
I done pulled up out at eight, noddin' but I'm wide awake
I'll put her on a plane, and I'll put her out for playin'
Hell nah, I'm not gon' change, even though I got some change

[Hook: Starlito]
If you ain't get no check, then I ain't checkin' for ya
Want this around my neck, I got that [?] for ya
If you ain't gettin' no money, she won't answer for ya
Won't pay these hoes no mind, too busy payin' my mortgage
And these lawyers
Payin'[???]
[???]
[???]
Used to stand on corners, hand to hand with quarters
Now we get it transported[Intro/Hook]
I'm down for the cause, but you shouldn't have to ask that
Fuckin' with the squad will get that ass clapped
You niggas fell off, like Owen Hart's last match
Fake ass rappers with all of they trap rap
I really wish you'd hush it
Shut the fuck up, you ain't talking bout nothin'
My niggas'll clap for me, like trouble, trouble they ALL bustin'
Some of 'em locked up, some fresh out cause they already done it
(Gun Sounds)

[Verse]
Got this 30-round, there's 5 of yall, so that's 6 a piece
But I bet the charges won't stick, like my Swisher Sweets
It's my birthday, let's smoke this whole Christmas tree
9 with the red dot, let's party like my nigga free (FREE RED DOT!)
So go an make a song 'bout what you NOT gon'do
And if you play me wrong I'll bring them shots to you
Two matching Glock 9s and that chopper too
Got my goonies suiting up like it's private school
Clap-on, clap-off lights out, night night bitch
Wonder what you gon' do now,you don't have me to write your shit
I booked like 7 shows and went and iced my wrist
Then bought a pound of OG kush, it's just the life I live
I might of fucked her twice but I don't like the bitch
Air Force fly, we got mutant straps, we on that Nike shit
You rappin' and you can't afford a car?
Get a job; petty, broke bitch, we know who you are
Wait, we know who you ain't, just left out the bank
Double shot to the back of yo' head make that ass plank
Smoke 'til I faint, drink 'til I c-ain't
Just say my name, that's just like playing with my aim, BANG
Big 5-7 SN and it's light grey
When I see him, I'm gon' pop that pussy, like my escape date
My Dickies full of racks, I think I'm Mike J
Cook-Up Boss done broke the buttons on my microwave
I'm on my Hustleman, that's Remy with the Rose'
And it's just money, baby; at least that's what Po' say
Love Life Live Large, Marty say it's on the way
Fuck wit us and you ain't keep it real, well that was yo' mistake
My homie Lil E he wheelchair grindin, but he can put you on yo' feet
Cashville waiting on that Grind Hard 3
And these niggas know they can't fuck wit me
1.2, I heard they cut the check?
Nah I was twitter-jacked
Lil shit head bitch run and tell em that
Who I signed wit? I ain't gon' tell em yet
Got a million on star? No thank you, where the rest of it at?
Grind Hard's my entity, 60-thousand twenty tees
Separation anxiety but no issues with dependency
Niggas with these ho tendencies, stay out of my business please
Niggas with these ho tendencies, stay out of my business PLEASE
Got a movie coming that I wrote myself
For the last 12 months I had nobody help
No radio song when I put myself on, that's why I be yellin Grind Hard til my death

[Outro]
Fuck y'all, not you, I mean all of y'all
Fuck y'all, not you, I mean all of y'allI don't always do what's best, I confess
Exhibit A, my ex, I rest my case
Tell you the rest yesterday
Starlito's Way, the Free at Last mixtape (alright)
This go around I'm my own boss
Trash Bag Gang bitch and I'm showing off (Grind Hard)
Gotta give it up to dro and soft
My latest yellow broad, I call her misses Know-It-All
Cheating on her man with Mr. Blow-It-All
A.K.A what it cost, I don't wanna talk
Lito fell off, is that what they thought
Now she like, girl let me tell you what this nigga bought
Couple gats and loft, and that thrax kind of expensive
So like a business expense, I tax right off as soon as I get it
Keep that shit so presidential, flow so existential
With a pocket full of dead inventors
Tried to put me up on shit that I'm already into
And if she ain't street smart, that's cool, I'm heavy in her
Mother fuck them pussy niggas that I never mention
Mind on a million, still winning, I ain't petty nigga
Clique to clique, dick riding, you pathetic nigga
You can have that bitch, I already hit her
She got miles like the Chevy nigga
You don't want beef, I'll turn you to a veggie nigga
I'm a Sapien-omnivore
Whose alibi was he's out on tour
Either that or court side watching the Commodores
Bad mother fucker, put that on the condom on the floor
Swisher sweets and a suite with a submissive freak
Them bitches cheap when you get 'em geeked
I love her brain, feel like she missing teeth
Probably get another chain, I'm on my Mr. T
Made six G's this week in Mississippi
Speakers blew at my last show, but they ain't miss a beat
I'm on fire nigga, Richard Pete
Getting Richard Pryored on my next deal, yeah this is me
Lito, with my pistol and zip at least
Cashville's streets dry, but I move like they slippery[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
When Im alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall
Flashbacks about the streets and memories of my dawgs
I just looked at my phone had a couple of missed calls
One from Gucci, one from Diddy, and a couple of brawds
Man I'm down for the cause
Put these bitches on pause
They'll lie to your face go fuck off with dawgs
I'm like what up to my fans I wrote this shit here for y'all
Come to your city stand on the couch, go hard, and ball
Cocaine music my nigga that shit considered the brand
All white is the movement what the fuck is you sayin'
Niggas thought I was playing til' I pulled up in them cars
Then stepped out wit' that jewerly now they see us as stars
I pushed the button dropped the top
Fixed my chain cock my Glock
Tell my homies squad up 'bouta fall up in the spot
Stay focused keep your eyes open niggas be hating
Its 1st degree murder if a nigga wanna play(BOW)
Cocaine straight face no emotion just silence
These niggas wildin'
They strive on violence
Niggas talkin' goon shit I preach it to the choir
I know it, I seen it, I done it . . . Cock, aim, fire

[Hook]
While we're gettin' to it(oooh)
This is how we do it(all night)
All Night
All it is, is G way
And you know my heat stay(by my side)
Just me and my thoughts waiting on that call
Listening to that cocaine
This is co-caine mu-sic mu-sic

[Verse 2: Starlito]
Trash bag on the backseat
Having flashbacks of a track meet
Metro PD trynna catch me
High speed back streets if we crash so be it(Fuck it)
Cause the strap to big can't even stash the heat(Damn)
Predicate felon in the passenger seat (So what we gonna do?)
So im smashing when they ask for ID(Scuur)
Blue lights flashin' there future in the rearview
God saying pull over but Lucifer I hear you
My heart racing
Might as well start bracing myself for the car chasin'
Man the law getting closer I pull to the shoulder
They sped right pass me they ain't even pull me over
I need a blunt and a rap check asap
Til then im in the trap
And I stay strap
20 pounds 20 thou yea I charge'em that
25 high risk boy a heart
Cashville on the ave where I started
Old school game yea I prolly need a starter hat
And a pull over I so fucking hooded yea Zilla voice
Bopping cocaine music ridin' in a vanilla porcheI can work with that
Smokin' on that killer shit
Fruity pebble, purple pack
You know we on some killer shit
My homie just beat a murder rap
You don't know who you dealin' with
Don't pay me, you gettin' murked for that
Two straps, like Urkel, shoot ya
Then say, damn, did I do that?
Difference between me & you, rich homie
Boy, the shit you talkin' bout, I do that

Too real for this rap shit..
Too real for this rap shit..

I figured it out
I'm a high risk & a flight risk
They fear you when you're living it out
Been a long time since an artist was really about
What they spit out they mouth
Yeah, niggas say they gettin' money
But it look like they sleep on the couch
Get you a house, gettin' new paper
Might just get me a route
Came a long way from making the newspaper
'Bout some shoot-outs

Everytime I go out
You know I bring that tool out
Need to quit bullshittin'
Cold Turkey, nigga, cool out
Need to quit bullshittin'
Cold Turkey, nigga, cool out
I said, you need to quit bullshittin'
Cold Turkey, cool out

Keep doing that shit you doing
And see what that gets you
Keep doing that shit you doing
And see where that gets you
Keep doing that shit you doing
And see where that gets you
Too many pictures on too many shirts
Now I get the picture

Can't nobody tell you shit, you know it all
But when you go and get fucked off, who you gon' call?
I recall, callin' my folks collect
Mama cryin', you know the rest
Never heard her so upset
I made mistakes, so you wouldn't have to make 'em
This advice comes with experience
You ain't got to take it
Call your granny, check on her
See how her day went
When I lose mine, I'mma lose my mind
Where would I be without that lady?
Streets crazy, I drive these hoes lazy
Knowing good and well I ain't got time for five ol' ladies
I come from nothing, my nigga
I'm just trying to motivate ya
You can't take nothing for granted
I'm grinding, no vacation

Ain't tryna fuck up my focus
So I been sober lately
Everytime I pull out my garage
I been gettin' pulled over lately
Investigations and accusations from open cases
Detectives nosey & racist, they get my poker face
(Fuck 'em)
Smoking 'til I'm sedated to hide my frustation
Shawty studying to be a nurse
I wonder if I'll ever have patience
Can't get comfortable with this cake
No, I'm never complacent
I'm grateful that the lord give it
But I know he can take it

Keep doing that shit you doing
And see where it gets you
Keep doing that shit you doing
And see where it gets you
Keep doing that shit you doing
And see where it gets you
Too many pictures on too many shirts
Now I get the picture..

IF YOU OUT HERE BULLSHITTIN', QUIT IT[Intro]
This is the payback
I know you bitch niggas from way back
Dodge Music, I ain't got a Maybach

It'd been cool to hear Curren$y on here talking shit about them Chevys but he don't ever send my songs back. I'm just glad to see a nigga doing better, you know what I'm sayin', better situation than when we was labelmates. Shout out to him. Lito...

[Verse 1]
Potential problems with pencil robbers
Normally I let my young nigga with extendeds solve 'em
Niggas wanna take my career, put it in a coffin
Meanwhile, I'm stressing - homie couldn't get that sentence off him
My gun legal, my tint legal, but have you seen my broad?
Not sure if she legal or not - you got a green card?
She ain't white but she ain't dark
And she let her sex drive drive when we in park
Say I don't smile enough - I need to quit stressing
I tell her break them tricks, teach my younger bitch the lesson
She thinks she a dime, but she just a seven
When I'm home don't know if I'll wake up in the Ville or heaven
E'ryday above ground feel like a real blessing
I remember I had 1 O and a 45 quarter 'til 11
Now I got a auto I don't even drive, hop in and rev it
Driving 'round my subdivision, maybe smoke a blunt
Then park that bitch right in the front, might not drive it for a month
And it's all mine (Lito!) I ain't gotta stunt
It's paid for, that's what they made it for, I only buy it once
Finance, I ain't interested - I'm pink slippin'
Put that in my bitch name, and she ain't trippin'
Waitress and a stripper, she say leave if ya ain't tippin'
IRS say she spent all her money on cars, then you see me in a
6.1 liter, auto transmission
Interior sand tan a-a-and I live it
V-8, no less than seven grams in it
Herbal, herbal, red ports, loud as a twin cam engine
On a heart, not hardly, but Davidson County plates
Smokin' like a Marley, lately I been out of state
I would win but I'm too high to race
Rims make it look outer space
Free Red Dot, and I'll red dot ya face (Bow!)
I got a Magnum with a magnum in it, yea free Tip
Challenger that'll leave the shit out of your V-6
Just snatched the new Charger too, that's just the Boosie in me
Already had the old one, S-R-T - stupid engine
Picture all 4 Dodges parked at Dodge's Chicken
How the fuck you gon' rob me? The black one got the robbers in it
The one with the stripes got a chopper in it
The other 2 all white, but Lito bought it, Gotti didn't
I like Dodges cause I be dodgin' my bitches
I put it on my hemi, my license just got suspended (Say what?)
I like Dodges cause I be dodgin' my bitches
I put it on my hemi, my license just got suspended
Fuck it, Dodge Music[Verse 1: Starlito]
I spent most of my twenties with a 30-round clip
I spent most of my twenties and I stashed the hundreds
You gotta warrant that ain't caught ya yet and keep running
I heard it all but won't repeat nothin'
I'm thuggin', I'm grindin', tryna get that check
Phone ringing off the hook blame it on this connect
You might get finessed, tell you no disrespect
Gave em all ones, got it from the stripper (bitch)
I ain't stressin', I ain't stresin', I ain't stressin'
I count the rest of this money when I finish countin' my blessings
You fucked up bout that bitch, I'm thinkin' bout her best friend
I'm guessin' that she restin', I just left her at the Western
She gave me a massage while you was sendin' text messages
She think she Nicki Minaj, I walk in my garage, I talk to all my cars
I load up all my guns and I ain't thought about tomorrow

[Hook: Starlito]
Don't do it, don't do it (don't do it)
I'm goin' through it (x4)

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
His big brother threw a cross cause he was mad about a bitch I was fuckin'
You can't control no pussy spared your wife you know how I'm comin'
Cali your boy pull up with chaotic and then go to dumpin'
I'm from where heroin bumpin', gum bumpin' we bump ya
Let loose and flush you then trunk you
Gangsta how I be comin'
Offset some Porsches get at me
I know you bitches can't stand me
One thang I love bout the game, you can't get stripes from pretending
I take shots, be shooting shit but don't no names'll get mentioned
Pussy bite then he fishin'
Or might be in they feelings
Talkin' shit bout guerrillas, then you might swim with the fishes
Before Gucci went to jail these other rappers was timid
He got his time, they poke they head out, now they talk like they killers
Criminal-minded all on Instagram, in public pretenders
I wish somebody would challenge me, was born a contender
Louisiana, no flex zone, we stay bout our business
Ridin' all through East Atlanta without tint on the windows

[Hook: Starlito]Intro

(Verse 1: Starlito)
Im thinkin' bout quittin'
Im drinkin, im sippin'
That lean got me trippin'
I stay off them phones
Watching the news while cleaning my pistol
Can't get any drank then im sick
It got me fienin' & twitchin'
I need intervention
Addict behavior
Still after this paper
Rap till I make it'
Stash it or save it
They taxin' im payin'
A stack? Thats okay
Just make sure it got the seal on it
Oh it dont? it got ????
Said he'll take 8?
Fuck it I still want it
Been up this last 48 straight
But im still on it
Like fuck it forreal I ain't fuckin with them pills homie
(AHHHHH) What the fuck? It just spilled on me (echo)[Intro]
Gave her the D... And even sent the Roses [3x]
But I just keep on getting hurt
I just keep on getting hurt
I'll sleep when I get murked
(Insomnia Addict)

[Verse]
I ain't taking no L's like Nerlens (Nope)
Ballin, I'm fly, like a pelican, N’awlins
Lyrics so Sharpe gotta catch it like Sterling
No bluffing, I'm calling, I'm all in, I'm balling, I'm balling
Like Spalding
And Rawlings
Darling
Thought it was love, thought I was falling, nah
The thought will be gone by Fall (Ah)
But she thought I was all of that, until August
Smoking and drinking, I love this shit
Pants sagging, I'm clutching, I'm thugging bitch
Before I paid a publicist I did a scholarship
Still getting money with some niggas I went to college with
On my life! Niggas made a whole lot of attempts, on my life
I promise not to slip
Probably done cried myself to sleep more times than I done mentioned
That's why I'm riding around, Thirty something hollow tips
And a dirty gun with[?] zipper, to scratch off like a lotto ticket
(Skkrrrtt, Skkrrrtt, Skkrrrtt)
I'm so G, probably die out'chere, tryna be me
Inching up on 500K, said goodbye to privacy
Rider in my driver seat
Me, myself, my heater, my drink
Put a hole in ya head just to see what you think
Fuck nigga I'm a G, what you think? (Lito!)
Keep it 100, Like my Porshe and on my publishing
Shawty so slutty, like a contortionist, it's lust
It's just...
I know she lying!
But it sounds so good...
I met this person
At this place
With a thing
Now I understood...

So no need to explain (no need to explain)
I'm so deep in the game (so deep in the game)
I need cleats
Had to get it out the mud so to speak
Like feet from the rain...
Speaking of the drank
Queen Latifah, flavor like Khadijah
Living single
Roll full of paper
Like a Khalifa
That reefer got me in a sleeper
Aaaaaa, I can't sleep though

Nah[Starlito Talking]
Ya ya right here you ready

[Verse 1: Starlito]

They say fear and love can't coexist
So i poured some syrup in my Sunkist
Woke up early this morning gave my blunt a kiss
Never got off that get money shit
Riding with me my myself and I cause nan one of us ain't gonna snitch
On the city bus with my pack
Cause the police so mother fucking hot
Ask Trip and Zilla had a zip of killa and bout 10 guns at my spot (chop chop)
Turn a studio into a dope house
Might be driving your ho car
That's my lolo bro, ain't trying to get pulled over
I ain't never sober, plus I'm riding dirty something
Just trying to see my 30 somethings
Damn judge keep giving out jersey numbers
I told my bitch i wasn't shit, and I wouldn't change, Guess she didn't believe me
Cause she didn't leave me, but what if she gets even (aaaaahh)
Got mixed emotions, for a few different reasons
Cause these niggas hoes, and these bitches greedy
But I'm solo tough, and I'm solo nice
They talking pies and ain't sold a slice
I'm so low key, won't sell my soul
Nor sell a gun, will pull up solo and take your life (that right)
You know it hurt when you just cry by yourself (by your self)
Trying to dry my eyes and drive but that won't help
I guess i broke my own heart
Breaking down, out here lost, I even tried pushing the on star (aah)
Turned in to a Grinch from dealing with these henchman
Got way to much experience concealing my intentions
This bullshit work won't rock up
On top of that, the nigga i got it from got locked up
Whats the odds of that
I know this lazy ass bitch won't cook shit
Sound crazy but I'm tired of waking up eating left over Ruth Chris For breakfast stressing
Running out of place to hide the money
Police got me scared to even ride with money
Saturday night I've been high since Sunday
Keep having nightmares i die for nothing
You don't hear them sirens coming?
I'm tripping thats the tv
Even when me and Trip get on the TV (step brothers)
These niggas can't see me
No tint no nothing when I'm out in public
Pistol no smile no doubt I'm thuggin'
Grinding up on 100 thousand and fuck it
I'm moving out of town without no luggage
Unsolved homicides unresolved grudges
I love my hood by these streets ain't nothing
Take nothing for granted and keep a nigga humble
Take nothing for granted and keep a nigga humble
They hear it my voice they can feel a nigga hunger
My stomach use to rumble I ain't getting any younger
Got a million on my mind I can feel man its coming
9 milli by my stomach I'm just keeping it 100 (LITO)

[Verse 2: Hambino]

First game on who? Not me
None of them threats gone ever stop me
Bitch got smashed when that nigga shot me
Be damned if a nigga box me
Got jammed so i gotta ride solo
Can't trust nan mother fucker no mo
Niggas in it for the fame
Getting pussy off the strength of the c10 logo
Took a loss first with the money
Then my homeboys start acting funny
My bitch draped in Louis then she tell me i can't support no woman (damn)
It was all good just a week ago
When a half a mill was off in my stash
And I took them everywhere we can go
Even though, niggas turn they head
They ain't hurt me just burned a bridge
They can't cross me, they lost me
Fuck em i got my kids
Fuck em i do my biz
I don't need a mother fucker sending me shit
Good for nothing, around here getting credit from off my dick
I don't need no friends, don't need no bitch
Gotta nigga in stuntman that's bout it
Got a few a couple 100 thou and a few hawks hid
Predicted this rain, yes I did
Yall hoes round here playing like kids
Forgot about why they call me homage
All your hate spilling on my garments
Fearless love is honest
And I'm bout to catch me a homi
My younging told me to wait up
Your a don out here Bino
Please let me do you that favor
So i sent him out on that mission
With a 50 cal extended
I told you once I'm loved
And i shall have my vengence
Im laid back cause im winning
This all a part of my plan
I speak my life into existence
Leaving foot prints in that sand
Got the world inside my hands
Just made a pact with Starlito
Though it might cost us our life
Our job is too free our people
We spread our wings like eagles
Predicating all evils
Be humble we dont do egos
Build pyramids where we go
Lost ends justify means fuck whats illegal
Its clutch time ya, and I'm gonna hit both free throws, Swish

Starlito, Hambino, Pressure dont bust pipes, nigga pressure make diamonds

This that real gangsta shit, I dont know what you other niggas on
