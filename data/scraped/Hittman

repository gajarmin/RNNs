[Verse 1: Hittman]
Xxplosive
West coast shit
My nigger-ish ways attract girls that used to turn they back
Causing me to yank they arm impose like I would do them harm
Now I'm saying thank you cause they tell me
My shit's the bomb
Xxplosive
For my niggas drinking Cognac
Smoking weed, always pack
More than one firearm, chrome rims, riding on
Chronic in your system, let me know my shit's the bomb
Xxplosive

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
West Coast shit nigga
Overdosage imperial pistols ferocious
Fuck a bitch don't tease bitch, strip tease bitch
Eat a bowl of these bitch gobble the dick
Hoes forgot to eat a dick can shut the fuck up
Gobble and swallow a nut up
Shut up and get my cash
Backhanded, pimp-slapped backwards and left stranded
Just pop ya collar, pimp convention, hoes for a dollar
Six-Deuce in a plush, six-deuce impala
Pimping hoes from Texas to Guatemala
Bitch niggas pay for hoes, just to lay with hoes
Relax one night, and pay to stay with hoes
Captain 'Save-'em-all-day', well save this dick
Bitch nigga, you more of a bitch than a bitch
You ain't into hitting pussy or hitting the switch
You into hitting bitches all for the grip
You punk bitch

[Verse 3: Nate Dogg]
All my real doggs still kick it with me
All my down hoes still tricking with me
All the true gangstas know
Nate ain't never love no ho
All the hoodrats still shake it for me
All my true fans still checking for me
All the real smokers know
Nate ain't passing nothing but dro indeed
Real trees, chronic leaves, no seeds
When I met you last night baby
Before I blew your mind
I thought we had a chance, lady
No more, now that I'm sober you ain't that fine
Don't wanna treat you wrong
Don't wanna lead you on
Here baby hit the bong
While the West Coast rolls along
While we, still making gangsta hits
You'll be, still jocking gangsta dicks
Damn girl you think you're slick?
Somebody better get this bitch, this bitch

[Verse 4: Six-Two]
I got these freaky hoes
Clapping they hands, stomping they feet
Every now and then they put they mouth on me
Nowadays a G like me can't even call it
A 23-year-old pussy fiend and freakaholic
Pimping bitches on the regular, I put that on the G
A hustler and a player, nowadays it pays to be
Let me drop some shit about this bitch I used to know
She gave your boy the head and said don't let nobody know
A bonafide pro, I had to grab the ho
She got freaky in your '64, I skeeted in her throat
Been knowing the ho for four days, pimping repays
And I bet you didn't know that she go both ways
She ate her best friend, I left them hoes at the mote'
They be beeping me and shit, but we don't kick it no mo'
Them hot hoes is fiending, they on the nuts
But bitch, I'm out your pussy when I nut, fo' real[Intro: Dr. Dre]
Yeah
Not many days left (Bring that shit)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Too much stress can make a nigga hesitate with no time left
(I feel blessed though)
Here we go to the next
A Dr. Dre exclusive with music bruising your neck (What the fuck)
Rip your plans up, Dre's ruling
You don't want to fuck around with the hands, let alone the gun foolin'
Like De La had niggas plug tunin'
Me and L had niggas zooming, me and Snoop flew the coup
Me keep your asses moving, with that hot shit
Club niggas like to request this around-the-clock shit
But I do it for my (hood niggas)
With rockets
Who learned how to survive and fatten them pockets
With 'x' amount of dollars the ballers, crime pays
But that snake shit'll leave that ass in a pine grave
Rocking project halls, from your sound-proof stalls
Got all you motherfuckers screaming "Yes yes y'all"

[Verse 2: Hittman]
All we need is 40 ounces and a tool to rule
In city duels used to buck fifty fools
Now I let off like white kids in elementary schools
Hit the news like Stacey Koon to Rodney crazy as a looney tune
Kids watch me, bitches jock me for this shit
Cause Hittman's the breaker of the monotony
For a faker man I won't shake your hand
Instead I'll shake like  land on which you stand like maracas in a mariachi band
Got my love back for this shit
Like  Joanie for Chachi now I'm a cocky man again
So I ride like the wind
In a fly Sedan Benz
Hanging out the window when I turn left to watch my rims spin
Ha, that line got my friends grinnin'
The fine bitches got my ends spendin'
The gin got my mind bendin'
In LA I stay balling like Lorenzen Wright
Lost angels sin at night
And I floss on the timid type
Dominique Dawes on that ass
End your night[Intro: Snoop Dogg and (Dr. Dre)]
(That's some good-ass weed)
Check it out Dawg, this game is a motherfuckin' trip man
Word on the streets
Everybody always tryin' to run up on me
Hollerin' about word on the streets is this nigga said this
Man I don't give a fuck about what that nigga said man
That's what's wrong with you niggas, you niggas is just like bitches
Ho-ass niggas, talk too motherfuckin' much (speak)
Study your own, get your own, you know what I'm sayin'?
Be independent nigga, biatch

[Interlude]
[Dr. Dre]:

[Verse1: Snoop Dogg]
Hmm...Dogg

And I really don't know, but that's just how it go (damn)
Dogg, so many niggas like to keep up shit
And just like a bitch (beotch) niggas be talkin' shit (nigga)
Smilin' in my face and then they blast me in the back (ka-ka-ka-ka-ka)
Niggas stay strapped from way back, cause payback...will
Make niggas wanna pop that shit
If you ain't ready for the game (uh-huh) nigga stop that shit
We rock that shit, my nigga Dre, drop that shit (right)
No mo' talkn', I'm walkin' and I'm poppin' the clip
Glock on the hip, set-trippin', drippin' and shit
If you act like a bitch (nigga) nigga you get smacked like a bitch

[Interlude]
[Snoop Dogg]:
Bitch niggas, bitch niggas (bitch niggas

[Dr. Dre]:
There niggas don't know what the fuck is goin' on
Yo Dogg, check it kick back
Let me holla at these niggas for a minute

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Straight off the streets of chaos and no pity
The aggravated, makin' these punk motherfuckers hate it
COMPTON is the city I'm from
Can't never leave the crib without a murder wea-pon
Huh, I can't live my life on broke no mo'
And most of these fools ain't shit but cutthroats
They smile in a nigga face, and for what?
They got the game all fucked up, and want my thing fucked up
I done learned a lot, seen a whole lot
The top notch nigga, I'm fiendin' for that spot
Now peep game on what Six-Deuce told me...

[Verse 3: Six-Two]
These niggas after yo' paper, Dr. D-R-E (wha?)
And these punk-ass hoes is lookin' for dough
You gotta watch your homeboys, cause a nigga never know
Oh, they'll be around, but when yo' paper get low
Just like Master P said, "There they go, there they go"
Bitch niggas...uh-huh

[Interlude]
Attention all personnel
Stop scheamin', and lookin' hard
Stop scheamin', and...an, and...an-an, and...and lookin' hard"

Bitch nigga, a bitch nigga
Bitch nigga, hella bitch nigga
You's a bitch nigga, motherfucker bitch nigga
A bitch nigga...a bitch nigga

[Verse 4: Hittman]
I know yo' type, so much bitch in you, if it was slightly darker
Lights was little dimmer my dick be stuck up in yo' windpipe
Hmm, you'd rather blow me than fight, I'm from the old school
Like Romey Rome homey yo, you owe me the right
To slap you, like the bitch that you are, been wantin` to cap you
Every since you was mad doggin' me with that bitch in yo' car
Fool, "Who do you think you are? Mr. Big Stuff"
Man, you shit on Hitt, get yo' shit bust, plus
Pistol-whipped, cover it up, use yo' bitch's blush
Mr. Powder Puff yo', bark ain't loud enough, huh
I know Chihuahuas that's mo' rah-rah, ha ha
I have to laugh Dre, I bet he take bubble baths
You don't want no trouble with the Aftermath staff, trust me
Doggy Dogg, Diggy Doctor plus me
No you's a busta slash hussy, soft as a hush puppy
Must we break you down to estrogen most hated specimen
A bitch nigga

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
I got mo' class than most of them, ran with the best of them
Forgave the less of 'em and blazed at the rest of them
What can I say? Cal-i-for-ni-a
Where niggas die every day over some shit they say
Disconnected from the streets forever
As long as I got a Beretta, nigga, I'm down for whateva
I roll with my shit off safety, for niggas that been hating me lately
And the bitches that wanna break me
If Cali blew up, I'd be in the Aftermath
Bumping gangsta rap shit, down to blast for cash
Cause from Eazy-E, to D.O.C., to D.P.G
Started from that S.O.B., D.R.E
Like Dub-C I'm rich rolling, pistol holding
Pockets swole nigga, that's how I'm rolling
Put the flame to the killer nigga
Worldwide homicide mob figure in the building, for real
I'm hitting switches, making bitches eat bitches
See me grab my dick every time I pose for pictures
I own acres, floor seats watching The Lakers
I'm cool with eses who got AK's in cases

[Hook]
Dedicated to all of those with big ego's
Never faking, we get the dough and live legal
Haters hate this, we sip the Mo' and yank the Heezos
Niggas play this in their Rovers, Jeeps and Regals
Dedicated to all of those with big ego's
Never faking, we get the dough and live legal
Haters hate this, we sip the Mo' and yank the Heezos
Bitches play this in their Benzes, Jeeps and Geos

[Verse 2: Hittman]
I`ll bust a Mr.Toughy, slash a Smoovy Doovy
Crashin` Flex on Tuesday's, harassing hoes at movies
Passing by with Uzis, like who you aiming at?
That shady bitch and that bitch nigga that was claiming that
Rat-a-tat-tat
{*automatic gunfire and screaming, followed by tires peeling*}
I don't sympathize for wack hoes and wimpy guys
You gotta recognize Hittman is an enterprise
Cali pride, Bronson rider South Central-ised
The Henny got me energized, smoke the guys
Tryna focus on mines, poke they eyes out, I'm L.A.'s loc'est
Hope they don't have to find out the hard way
Like snitch niggas in the pen that get hit when the guards look the other way
We hitting hard - Hittman and Dre
You playing games? I suggest you know the rules
We putting guns to fools, make you run yo jewels
Take yo honey and cruise to the Snooty & snooze, cop booze
Pop coochie 'til the nut oozes, you shouldn't fuck with crews
That's sick, The Aftermath is we rule shit
I'm Big Hit, don't confuse me with no other bout to blow, motherfucker

[Hook]

[Outro]
You look like AC Green, bitch don't call here anymore
With feet like Ben Vereen's, bitch don't call here anymore
No no, no no
[Hittman]
What up? It's Hittman
I ain't at the crib right now
So you can leave your name and number after the beep
Unless it's Tammie's ugly ass - I ain't fucking with you[Intro x4]
All these niggas and all these hoes in here
Somebody here gon' fuck

[Verse 1: Hittman]
Talking that, walking that, spitting at hoes
Smoking this, drinking that, gittin` at hoes
Fuck this I'm hitting that I'm hitting em both
Have one riding dick, one licking my toes
When I'm loving these hoes there ain't no love involved
No hugs, no kisses
Bear rugs, bare britches
Rare bitches like them hoes in them Blacktail pictures
Bitch jumped off my dick
Is that Dre over there

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Yeah, I just took some Ecstasy
Ain't no telling what the side effects could be
All these fine bitches equal sex to me
Plus I got this bad bitch laying next to me
No doubt, sit back on the couch
Pants down, rubber on, set to turn that ass out
Laid the bitch out, then I put it in her mouth
Pulled out, nutted on a towel and passed out

[Kurupt]
Come on let's get high, high
Let's get high, high
Come on let's get high, high
Let's get high, all my ladies
Let's get high, high
High, high
Let's get high, high
Come on let's get high

I make the four hop
Pull up at the spot
Weed by the barrels in my G'd up apparel
Stomping in the party
Kurupt, Young Gotti
I'm fucking something in this bitch
Hit 'em with some gangsta shit
Put something in your mouth bitch real tasty
I'm looking real saucy in my gangsta-ass Staceys
Hit the party, ease up, Kurupt with an ounce an'
Got all the hoes in this motherfucker bouncing
Down to

YO WHATTUP SCRAM JONES
Mel-Man what's cracking
Whassup wit all these ol' punk ass hoes in here

[Ms. Roq]
Nigga what, I'm a hustling bitch
I like them get rich niggas
Them hit the switch niggas
Niggas bout the sex and which bitch to hit next
While I'm kicking my game and collecting them checks
Got all y'all niggas vexed to fuck this triple-X rated ho
You say you ain't eat it, you ate it though
Roq don't stop, can't be dropping no drawers
To the niggas how you figure got you shitting in yours
Yeah, little dicks always running they mouth
While a bitch is better off to masturbate and be out
All you bitches up in here know what I'm talkin about
Get the loot, get the ice
Fuck the wife, no doubt
Trying to live lavish
Marry a big dick and stay carried
Holla back at them niggas that hollered at me
Pop the Cris'
Whip the six and shit
And have all y'all niggas limp when I twist my shit
Yeah, bitch ass niggas[MC Ren]
Yeah nigga, MC Ren up in this motherfucker
(West West y'all)
Yeah, L.A. niggas
L.A. niggas rule the world nigga
Y'all niggas gotta recognize, yaknahmsayin?
Niggas don't wanna peep game, yaknahmsayin?
But this shit come all the way back around here
My nigga Dre, droppin' heat box on y'all bitch-ass
Yaknahmsayin? You gotta recognize
L.A. niggas, connected all over the motherfucking world, nigga
Recognize this; peep game

[Time Bomb]
Now in my younger days I used to sport a rag
Backpack full of cans plus a four-four mag
G'd up from the feet up
Blue'd up from the shoe up's how I grew up
Loc'n, smokin' and drinkin' til we threw up (threw up)
At Leimert Park, taggin', hittin' fools up
Ditching my class, just to fuck yo' school up
You don't wanna blast, nigga tuck yo' tool up
But don't sleep, y'all niggas quick to shoot you
Now there's another motherfucker with no future
But Time Bomb much smoother when I maneuver, dope like Cuba
Got em jumpin Disciples to the Hoover

[King T]
I'm coming "Straight Outta Compton" with a loose cannon
Smoke big green, call it Bruce Banner
Watch your manners, at last another blast from the top notch
From way back with the pop rocks, I pop lock witcha
Picture this, Dr. Dre twisting wit Tha Liks
And Hittman bought a fix
Don't trip, it's a Time Bomb in this bitch
Here it tick tick tick tick {*BOOM*}
Wait a minute it's on, I tell it like a true mackadelic
Weed and cocaine sold separate, check it
From sundown to sunup -- clown and run up
The Aftermath'll be two in your gut, nigga what?

Chorus: Knoc-Turn'al, Kokane

We roll deep, smoke on weed drink and pack heat
Requirements for survival each day -- in L.A.!
It don't stop, we still mash in hot pursuit from the cops
Analyze why we act this way -- in L.A.!

[Hittman]
Gimme that mic fool, it's a West coast jack move
They call me Hitt - cause I spit like gats do
Cock me back
Bust caps for my Macz Crew, at Fairfax
Who used to wear Air Max shoes, that's true
But I grew up where niggas jack you, harass you
Blast you, for that set you claim (where you from?)
Mash on you for your Turkish chain, C.K. B.K
Blue'd up or flame, I ran wit a gang
I helped niggas get, jacked for they Dana Dane's
My pants hang below my waistline
I look humble wanna rumble? (yeah yeah)
I bang though, like Vince Carter from the baseline
Don't waste my time
Fuck a scrap in killa Cali, AK's and 9's
One-time's, sun-shines, and fine-ass bitches
Hawaiian Thai, drive-bys, six-fo's on switches

[Xzibit]
I was raised in the hood called WHAT-THE-DIF'
Where the brothers in the hood, refused to go Hollywood
Slugs for the fuck of it
Anybody hatin' on us can suck a dick
If I catch you touching mine you catch a flat-line, dead on the floor
Better than yours, driving away gettin' head from a whore
It's AvireX-to-the-Z
Fuckin' with me might get you banned from TV
Cassette and CD it's all mine the whole nine the right time
Multiply, we don't die, the streets don't lie
What, so neither do I, I'm bad for your health
Like puttin' a pistol up to your face and blastin' yourself

[Defari]
Five in the mornin', burglars at my do'
Glock forty-five in my dresser drawer
Let 'em come in BLAOW he see the thunder roll
Roll with niggas, who buy fifths by the fo'
And brew's by the case
SLAP YOU in the face with the bass, Dr. Dre laced
Likwit Kings wit Sedans and gold rings
Haters fold the style, but can't find no openings

Chorus

[Outro]
In L.A

That's how we ride (4X)[Produced by Metro Boomin]

[Verse 1]
It was 1 in the mornin' and I was up yawnin'
Moms asked where I'm goin', to the hood if you ain't knowin'
Pops locked up so mama couldn't stop me
I was out the house, ASAP Rocky
And it wasn't cause she couldn't control us
We was her babies, she just wanted to hold us
And we ain't get disciplined, her friend started whisperin'
About how she was a bad mama, mama said "fuck 'em then"
I was in the streets stylin', nobody could tell me nothin'
Grandpa or grandma, not my auntie or my favorite cousin
I was buzzin'
Fuckin' all these hoes wearing no condoms, no nothin'
I used to ditch school when the homie had the Chevy
I used to sneak and smoke stress weed

[Hook]
But now I'm rollin' on dubs
How you feel, whooptie woop, nigga, what?
Now I'm rollin' on dubs
How you feel, whooptie woop, nigga, what?
All these hoes showin' love
How you feel, whooptie woop, nigga, what?
All these hoes showin' love
How you feel, whooptie woop, nigga, what?

[Verse 2]
SKKKRRRT, I was on a mission
On a mission to the money, sun down till it sunny
Know my family love me
Ridin' in the car with two niggas and a pistol
This ain't funny, I do it all for the money, hold up
Slowly as I pull up to the donut stand, I already know the plan
Hop out and get on your mans and take what he got
Go through pockets, wallets and socks, dig all the knots
It's a stick-up, phone ring, it's my mama
In the middle of some drama, so I don't pick up
Thinking I gotta get my shit up, I gotta pick my bitch up
Let's hurry up and leave, I feel the police near us
So we left with a thousand dollars cash
It was me and my nigga, so you know I went half
Then shit get real when niggas get greedy
Pop, pop, pop, pow, that's when he leave me[Produced by Metro Boomin]

It's fuckin ackrite
Question is - can I get some? Know what I'm saying?
Ack-rite, bitch
When I see you in the spot, you just act right, you know what I'm saying?
When I yank you by the fuckin' arm
Don't be looking at a nigga crazy
Just give up the digits and be the fuck out, you know what I'm saying?
Let me break it down for y'all

[Verse 1: Hittman]
It was just one of those days
When I wanted to catch sunrays
It`s fun to gitt blunted on a Sunday afternoon
Nigga Bathed & got groomed, grabbed the gat for misbehavors
And the chocolate flavored boom, lost in hip-hop tunes
Zoom-zoom like the Commodores
Wonder will we have drama or, end up clowning whores
Round up four good-to-go girls
Like them Barbary Coast girls, riding shotgun, baby
I be postin all-world in the ride
Sipping 151 done gave me too much pride to back down
Soon as we get to The Beach I'mma put my fuckin mack down
I'm playin lead, not the background
It's time to put Bronson on the map now
Walk with my hand on my Johnson, crack a smile
Cuties peep my style, if I don't get some ackrite
I'mma have to ack-wild

[Hook: Hittman]
Blunt in my left hand, drink in my right
Strap by my waistline, cause niggas don't fight
Sucker free for life, so you better think twice
(Aight? And a give a nig' some ackrite)
I'm the type of nigga playa-haters don't like
Snatchin' up your honey for some late night hype
And snobby-ass bitches get slapped out of spite
(Aight? So give a nig' some ackrite, right)

[Hittman]
Uhhhhh.. drink kicking in, I'm stimulated
For those that don't know big words: I'm FUCKIN FADED
Eighty-three degrees, ease to a shaded spot
Our first spot was cool till some gangsters made it hot
Now we plot and pose
Plus we watchin hoes, with lots of flesh exposed
Getting swarmed by those type of niggas
With no game but brown-nose
So I impose only like pros can
"Yo, is this your man?" "No."
Grab the bitch's hand, "I'm Hittman."
Bling! Gold chain gleam
"You're very eligible for my summer league team."
Maybe too extreme cause the sister got steamed
Then Miss Thing tried to scream on my brethren
I got mad, spit phlegm on the name
Stefan, tattooed on her arm
Ho you ain't the bomb, must be a dyke
Gitcho' lips swoll, or give a nig' some ackrite

[Hook: Hittman]
Blunt in my left hand, drink in my right
Strap by my waistline, cause niggas don't fight
Sucker free for life, so you better think twice
(And a give a nig' some ackrite)
I'm the type of nigga playa-haters don't like
Snatchin' up your honey for some late night hype
And snobby-ass bitches get slapped out of spite
(So give a nig' some ackrite, right)

[Hittman]
Fronting on the ack-rite, causing me to act up
Good Samaritans save that ho from getting slapped up
My homies crack up at the scene I made
Yo my actions ain't serene when a nigga's on fade
If it wasn't for the one-time brigade
I woulda sprayed at the hooker tramp
As cops parade I'm afraid it's time to break camp
Make tracks, where else can we go to take hoes
From fake macks? {*CAR HORN*} Aiyyo, chase them girls
In that black Maxima, the passenger, almost fractured her
Neckbone, looking back at us
Plus, they on the dick cause the Caddy's plush
They blush, I bumrush the huss, with the largest crush
Try to swing an ep tonight so I don't have to keep in touch
Keep it on hush without the tippin`
Macking interrupted by some niggas set-tripping
Clip in the strap, I showed these niggas how to act

[Hook: Hittman][Hook] x2
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Everyday it's the same thing, L.A. ain't changed
Niggas still playa hating, but Dre ain't changed
I'm just a lot smarter now
Cause these niggas is banging ten times harder now
Niggas bringing they ass up in the wrong part of town
Better turn their car around
Rolling the window down (Hey can we talk it out?)
(Nah, get the fuck out!)
Johnny got a shotgun
And he ain't even strong enough to cock one
Fuck trying to job hunt
Niggas got AK's
Niggas is way crazier than Dre was back in his N.W.A. days
Niggas spray strays and shoot without looking
Niggas walk by and blast, without leaving a footprint
I think the attitudes are twice as worst
It takes half the time to get your life reversed
Always trying to play Rambo with they ammo
Make a nigga wanna stay in family mode

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Knoc-turn'al]
Late nights is full of lead that whistles as it goes by
Murder arrives, anytime
Bullets take flight when the fo'-five ignites
Some hearts skip a beat, some get blew out, and never re-light
With you in the site of youngsters with automatics
Busting on shit to lay everything down even tourists and non-affiliates
These days, gun play is official with green lights on every block
And though the sign tells you too it's not best to stop
On every corner, Cali niggas are dumping
You'll be shaking your soul loose from the box at the coroner's
Making death not so foreign to ya
Niggas got Rugers and M14's with enough ammo to leave
An armored truck Swiss cheese
I've learned to stay away from house parties
I've seen too many go and end up absent without leaving
Ain't no warm welcomings
My eyes have witnessed the bend in on
Nights that don't sleep, and fireworks until dawn

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Hittman]
Now tell me, what the fuck is this man?
Niggas doing brothers in worse than the Klan
Can't even stand in front of your building and chill without yielding
Twelve year old children that kill, blood spilling
Thugs be illing, unnecessary slugs filling the sky
Usually drilling the one that wasn't willing to die
Yes sir, in the Killing Field I got my
Life preserver, and I'll do my time for murder
These niggas got the nerve to
Question me 'bout the colors that I got on?
I see that red dot on your knot
'Bout to get your whole crew shot on
A Soldier of Fortune, I'm the wrong man to plot on
Took him out on the spot before he even got on
My hit list, peep this
I cock back, you bow down, bust round, bloody the ground
Retaliation sounds like this

[Hook] (x2)[Intro]
[Pilot]
Los Angeles approach control
This is Cessna 0281-Echo-119.3, over
[Control]
Cessna 81-Echo, accept approach control, roger, go ahead
[Pilot]
Cessna 81-Echo is over the Compton Airport, 52 at 5,000
Requesting ground controlled approach to Los Angeles Airport, over
[Control]
81-Echo, Los Angeles approach control, roger
Radar identification; turn right, heading
0-3-0

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
I got mo' class than most of them, ran with the best of them
Forgave the less of 'em and blazed at the rest of them
What can I say? Cal-i-for-ni-a
Where niggas die every day over some shit they say
Disconnected from the streets forever
As long as I got a Beretta, nigga, I'm down for whateva
I roll with my shit off safety, for niggas that been hating me lately
And the bitches that wanna break me
If Cali blew up, I'd be in the Aftermath
Bumping gangsta rap shit, down to blast for cash
Cause from Eazy-E, to D.O.C., to D.P.G
Started from that S.O.B., D.R.E
Like Dub-C I'm rich rolling, pistol holding
Pockets swole nigga, that's how I'm rolling
Put the flame to the killer nigga
Worldwide homicide mob figure in the building, for real
I'm hitting switches, making bitches eat bitches
See me grab my dick every time I pose for pictures
I own acres, floor seats watching The Lakers
I'm cool with eses who got AK's in cases

[Hook]
Dedicated to all of those with big ego's
Never faking, we get the dough and live legal
Haters hate this, we sip the Mo' and yank the Heezos
Niggas play this in their Rovers, Jeeps and Regals
Dedicated to all of those with big ego's
Never faking, we get the dough and live legal
Haters hate this, we sip the Mo' and yank the Heezos
Bitches play this in their Benzes, Jeeps and Geos

[Verse 2: Hittman]
I`ll bust a Mr.Toughy, slash a Smoovy Doovy
Crashin` Flex on Tuesday's, harassing hoes at movies
Passing by with Uzis, like who you aiming at?
That shady bitch and that bitch nigga that was claiming that
Rat-a-tat-tat
{*automatic gunfire and screaming, followed by tires peeling*}
I don't sympathize for wack hoes and wimpy guys
You gotta recognize Hittman is an enterprise
Cali pride, Bronson rider South Central-ised
The Henny got me energized, smoke the guys
Tryna focus on mines, poke they eyes out, I'm L.A.'s loc'est
Hope they don't have to find out the hard way
Like snitch niggas in the pen that get hit when the guards look the other way
We hitting hard - Hittman and Dre
You playing games? I suggest you know the rules
We putting guns to fools, make you run yo jewels
Take yo honey and cruise to the Snooty & snooze, cop booze
Pop coochie 'til the nut oozes, you shouldn't fuck with crews
That's sick, The Aftermath is we rule shit
I'm Big Hit, don't confuse me with no other bout to blow, motherfucker

[Hook]

[Outro]
You look like AC Green, bitch don't call here anymore
With feet like Ben Vereen's, bitch don't call here anymore
No no, no no
[Hittman]
What up? It's Hittman
I ain't at the crib right now
So you can leave your name and number after the beep
Unless it's Tammie's ugly ass - I ain't fucking with you[Intro: Snoop Dogg and (Dr. Dre)]
(That's some good-ass weed)
Check it out Dawg, this game is a motherfuckin' trip man
Word on the streets
Everybody always tryin' to run up on me
Hollerin' about word on the streets is this nigga said this
Man I don't give a fuck about what that nigga said man
That's what's wrong with you niggas, you niggas is just like bitches
Ho-ass niggas, talk too motherfuckin' much (speak)
Study your own, get your own, you know what I'm sayin'?
Be independent nigga, biatch

[Interlude]

Hmm...Dogg

And I really don't know, but that's just how it go (damn)
Dogg, so many niggas like to keep up shit
And just like a bitch (beotch) niggas be talkin' shit (nigga)
Smilin' in my face and then they blast me in the back (ka-ka-ka-ka-ka)
Niggas stay strapped from way back, cause payback...will
Make niggas wanna pop that shit
If you ain't ready for the game (uh-huh) nigga stop that shit
We rock that shit, my nigga Dre, drop that shit (right)
No mo' talkn', I'm walkin' and I'm poppin' the clip
Glock on the hip, set-trippin', drippin' and shit
If you act like a bitch (nigga) nigga you get smacked like a bitch

[Interlude]
[Snoop Dogg]:
Bitch niggas, bitch niggas (bitch niggas

[Dr. Dre]:
There niggas don't know what the fuck is goin' on
Yo Dogg, check it kick back
Let me holla at these niggas for a minute

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Straight off the streets of chaos and no pity
The aggravated, makin' these punk motherfuckers hate it
COMPTON is the city I'm from
Can't never leave the crib without a murder wea-pon
Huh, I can't live my life on broke no mo'
And most of these fools ain't shit but cutthroats
They smile in a nigga face, and for what?
They got the game all fucked up, and want my thing fucked up
I done learned a lot, seen a whole lot
The top notch nigga, I'm fiendin' for that spot
Now peep game on what Six-Deuce told me...

[Verse 3: Six-Two]
These niggas after yo' paper, Dr. D-R-E (wha?)
And these punk-ass hoes is lookin' for dough
You gotta watch your homeboys, cause a nigga never know
Oh, they'll be around, but when yo' paper get low
Just like Master P said, "There they go, there they go"
Bitch niggas...uh-huh

[Interlude]
Attention all personnel
Stop scheamin', and lookin' hard
Stop scheamin', and...an, and...an-an, and...and lookin' hard"

[Dr. Dre]
Bitch nigga, a bitch nigga
Bitch nigga, hella bitch nigga
You's a bitch nigga, motherfucker bitch nigga
A bitch nigga...a bitch nigga

[Verse 4: Hittman]
I know yo' type, so much bitch in you, if it was slightly darker
Lights was little dimmer my dick be stuck up in yo' windpipe
Hmm, you'd rather blow me than fight, I'm from the old school
Like Romey Rome homey yo, you owe me the right
To slap you, like the bitch that you are, been wantin` to cap you
Every since you was mad doggin' me with that bitch in yo' car
Fool, "Who do you think you are? Mr. Big Stuff"
Man, you shit on Hitt, get yo' shit bust, plus
Pistol-whipped, cover it up, use yo' bitch's blush
Mr. Powder Puff yo', bark ain't loud enough, huh
I know Chihuahuas that's mo' rah-rah, ha ha
I have to laugh Dre, I bet he take bubble baths
You don't want no trouble with the Aftermath staff, trust me
Doggy Dogg, Diggy Doctor plus me
No you's a busta slash hussy, soft as a hush puppy
Must we break you down to estrogen most hated specimen
A bitch nigga

{Scratches - "Attention all personnel"}

I swear my heart so cold. My niggas wit me they know
We don't trust no soul, I swear my heart all froze
Always trained to go, Henny in my zone
I got a bad bitch and she bold, I got her mind dumb blown
But I'm, so cold so cold I'm cold
These diamonds on me cold
These niggas wit me cold
I swear my heart so cold

(Verse 1: Hit-Man)
I swear I'm cold, I swear I'm cold
No fear, Straight animal
A little paranoid, I can't help it
This Glock is unbearable
And I'm so high, I'm soarin
These bullets rain, they pourin
These women all adore us, And all my pistols foreign
Please don't play both sides, That will get yo ass caught up
And don't you ever tell no lie, Cause that's the reason why we don't trust
For my family I go crazy, Cause that's my real love
My squad with whatever. Disrespect We tear them up
And its two G's all on my belt, Louis 13 cause its the best
And we don't love none of these bitches, Cause its not good for your health
I think I lost my mind, Smokin all this dope
Ready oh am I, I keep my ninas close
We so savage, God my witness
I swear I'm so cold
I swear I'm cold, I swear I'm cold
God my witness, I swear so I'm cold
I swear I'm cold, I swear I'm cold

(Hook)
I swear my heart so cold. My niggas wit me they know
We don't trust no soul, I swear my heart all froze
Always trained to go, Henny in my zone
I got a bad bitch and she bold, I got her mind dumb blown
But I'm, so cold so cold I'm cold
These diamonds on me cold
These niggas wit me cold
I swear my heart so cold

(Verse 2: Swagg)
And the chain on my neck so froze
That's probably why my heart cold
All my guys keep big poles
Think its a lie, you can ask Rico
I make these haters sick
Cause they crushes be on my dick
The Opps made niggas clique
So I called my nigga Hit
Need that top, I don't need no tease
And I check that bag, With Ease
My niggas smoke dope, Sip lean
I's up for them G's
No lackin, I love my team
B.I.P to broski JOJO, And to JayLoud rest in peace
It's one time for them groupies, Two times for my niggas
Hallow tips in them 30's, We will smoke you like a swisher
I hope you get the picture, And always take one with ya
But till then, Bricksquad D-Block
Just know, We toting pistols
Its two beams, Stuffed in my belt
When I smile, Make these hoes wet
Bet these bands, Will make her flex
So I do this shit, For a check
Swear that we trust no soul
Jus benjamins no hoes
And everybody blows
Fuck the opps
They gotta go

(Hook)
I swear my heart so cold. My niggas wit me they know
We don't trust no soul, I swear my heart all froze
Always trained to go, Henny in my zone
I got a bad bitch and she bold, I got her mind dumb blown
But I'm, so cold so cold I'm cold
These diamonds on me cold
These niggas wit me cold
I swear my heart so cold

And the whole time, niggas thought she was a keeper
Shit, that ho the reason I'm a freezer

[Hittman]
(Where the hell ya been homie?) Chillin`
(Do you think you`ll go platinum?) Man listen
(Everybody's talkin)
Some are dissin` so I keep all your ass at fire arm distance
(What are your goals?) 8 figures
(What is your role?) straight nigga
(What about your flow?)
Ha you wondering you gott to spend with me in the summer you'll see

[Hook]

[Hittman]
Extra Extra! Read all about him! Hitt signed to Aftermath
Now the B-Boys doubt him, females crowd him, decoys
Clone him, females want him, everybody on him, but he don't
Care bout it man when he be zonin`, I remember when
The boy used to be a loner, waitin for the bus to come, posted
On the corner, of Crenshaw & Country Club  he
Had no pub, now his car gitt`s valet  parked, and he’s the talk of the club
Groupies in Gucci, Tuedays at Sky Sushi, high class mommas
At Las Palmas he gitt honored, came a long way from wearing Puma`s and Bombers
In line to see Krush Groove at the Baldwin Theater, now with
Rhymes he touch you, the small niggas hate him,ya'll couldent fade
Him with bleach on your clippers, now on the radio, he played
Bout as frequent Jigga, see the picture?

[Hook]

[Hittman]
Allow me to introduce myself, I'm sick of fools
Speakin for me like I need help, you usually don't
See me cuz I be stealth, and you should buy
My cd cuz I need wealth, you ever see me
Runnin its never for health, only for prez, the ones
That`s dead, mainly the one with the least hair on
His head, like white color crime, man i gotta stay
Fed, now if I couldn't rhyme I`d probably be pre-med, spending
Most of my time tryna to stop A.I.D.S. spread, but thats
Not my calling mines is ballin instead, slangin` rap like
Its crack to you damn baseheads ,why do you think they
Call me Hitt?? Sign a contract then that`s what I supply you with
Whether combat a bomb track, or your chick, crime
Scene or magazine I'm all over it

[Hook]

[Eminem]
I stay higher than racial tension, with a facial expression
Tensed up like I’m suffering from a case of nasal congestion
Eyes hazel, complexion beige, age still in question
Critics hate my tape kids can’t wait for the next one
As long as there’s rejects, my tape never e-jects the deck
That’s the level of re-spect each cd gets
While y'all are grasping at straws like me snortin' crushed aspirin
And gaspin' at air ‘n collapsin’ in malls
I’m just a realistic impression of artistic expression
Who’s tape was in the deck when the kids shot up delicatessen
So when I — launch a verse full of contra-verse
That’ll haunt you worse than Ma$e before he joined the church
Ok kids I dismiss this class I’m going back in the broom closet to sniff this gas
Umm, Mr. Mathers just missed the bathroom
Pissed his pants and the world still kissed his ass
This is my last album , this is my last Valium
Just pick my ass up when I pass out in the bathroom
If y'all don’t like this shit that you hearing then blow me ‘til your lipstick is smearin'
And I can see my dick disappearin’

[Hook][Hook]
If you like getting high
Smoke out baby
And to the ladies that's fine
I'd love to love you baby
But see I'm trying to get mynz
So don`t yall hate me
And it's about that time to do my thing

[Verse 1: Hittman]
Well it's funky funky funky cuz you heard it from Hitt first
Dr`s operating while I'm spittin` a sick verse
Strictly for banging when you're ridin` around
But if you see the *** you got to mute your sounds
Cuz you don't want your whip to end up in the impound
But that's what would happen if the strap was found
They crackin` down, but I be crackin` up
Outsmartin`em like Buggs in a ACME truck
Now who's the looniest toon black as Daffy Duck
That like them nasty ass sluts like Janet Jacme, whuuut
This Swiss Miss named Hershey Kiss gave me  acne bumps
Now I wear a Sex Packet when I Humpty Hump
It`s like that yall (that yall)
We just Macz yall (Macz Yall)
And if you can`t Ackrite well don`t ack at all
And if your hair is gittin` thin then rock it bald
Han on my cock like Herbie i`m a rock it yall
They raided Tower records (for) sellin` dope so pure
They raid The Wherehouse becuz my dope`s so pure
Hey Dre keeps supply`n me there ain`t no cure
A lot of tryers in the game but not a lot of doer`s
I`m Guinness Stout with this style you`re watered down like Coors
When I rock this on Apollo (just watch) don`t boo us
Cuz if you do we`re stompin` Sandman for tryna remove us
I`ll boo boo on you fakers fool with the movers & shakers
In L.A. I be ballin` like the Lakers
Vacating in Vegas, Madalay Bay stayin` faded
Want a hit? Here`s the muthafuckin` latest

[Hook]

[Bridge: X2]
I be the dopest nigga that never slung caine
Live in the hood but I don`t gangbang
The rawest man since 87 Kane
Now watch me do my thang

[Verse 2: Hittman]
Even witcha eyes closed
Everybody knows nobody flows like I flows
That`s how I gitt the girls with the nice toes
Plus they say "you know, you look just like Cole" (who?)
That`s when I hitt`em with the night pole
The nightstick, Las Palmas gitt a white chick
Good Bar gitt a black chick
El Carmen gitt an overnight chick
Low key chicks they be at Jo-seph`s
You gotta be low key to even know this
Is my year to be a brag & boaster
Sippin` Cognac signin` children`s posters
Girls actin` right then sit on the sofa
Fools talkin` smack the gat is in the holster
Oh you wanna smoke muthafucka? Hold up
Here`s some Zig Zags muthafucka roll up

[Hook][Intro: Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg]
La-da-da-dah its the motherfucking d-e-t-o-x
Coming in you know we need funk flex
Radio mobbin while i kick it with D-R-E
You know its dropping in a month and we just packed a little heat
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
You know we got kendrick in this motherfucker
And picked up hittman again
We lighting it off this summer nigga
So just chill and kick waiting for this shit like before[Hook: Kurupt]
Now this, this is one of them occasions
Where the homies not doin it right
I mean he found him a ho that he like
But you can't make a ho a housewife
And when it all boils down you gonna find in the end
A bitch is a bitch, but a Dogg is a man's best friend
So what you found you a ho that you like
But you can't make a ho a housewife (wife)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
I mostly sold dick while I packed a gold clip
Worked my money-maker, she got paper, she bout to trip
(Where the fuck is my money?) I cannot G guilty
You pimpin strong, but comin home, to sheets that be filthy
She on the dillzy, I take advantage
All up in them panties, I got this bitch speakin Spanish
I'm mannish - get yo' nails out my back
Slut I'm bout to nut and get up, go scrub yo' cat
Learn the player rules, this is how I play a dude
Might not be a freak, but she got on the choosin shoes
Dollar signs are folded, I can't control it
Tryin to leave her, beeper just exploded
She sweatin me, won't let me, broad turned fraud
Now she on this dick huh, got her turnin tricks huh
Man it's a trip I don't trip I'm in yo' Lexus flexin
I left her up in Dallas, Texas - assed-out

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Hittman]
Naw "ho" ain`t short for honey, almost had to wail her like Bunny
Tellin tales of bein pregnant, catchin Nordstrom sales with abortion money
I spotted her, seen her with my nigga when I shot at her
Now we got beef, he caught up in the ho's erotica
Exotic - she's psychotic, rockin his Nautica
Soon he'll need antibiotics (sucka bitch)
Name a sexual disease, she got it like Sam Goody
You be like, "Damn how could she hit me off with chlamydia?"
Fool I pity ya
We live in the city of ballers
With more bounce and in a Zapp, she will doo wa ditty ya
Prettier to grittier, the wittier can get her
To the Hotel, Niko, on some Sauve shit like Rico
That's when I caught a Vision like Coleco
A high-post ho, a perfect way for me to keep dough
Huh, have her sellin ass on Bronson Ave. and Pico

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
At the ho-tel, mo-tel, or the Holiday Inn (say what nigga?)
I said if that bitch keep fuckin up (beotch) then we'll fuck her friends
I said I dip, dive, what can I say?
Niggas need to stop fuckin with O.J
Some niggas bang Blood, some niggas bang Crip
And bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
I had a dream of hoes, I had to screen my hoes
I seen my hoes in all kinds of clothes
Lil' Almond Joy, I truly enjoy
If you blew my balls, right through my drawers
Come back to the mansion, chill at the spot
From the way she was blowin, I know she does it a lot
I have a eight-and-a-half, nine-and-three-quarters
The ho started callin when I started boss ballin
Gimme some head, gimme some ass (uh-huh)
Gimme some cash, pass it to Daz
Pass it to Snoop, or pass it to Nate
See hoes eat dick like eggs and steak
It ain't shit new, I thought you knew (what?)
I knew you would, you wish you could
Break a G down, break me down
But I'mma see you on the rebound (what what?) D.P. style

[Hook][Intro: The Asoka]

Sometimes you have this idea of what paradise will be like. The stuff that dreams are made off. But when you actually get there… It’s something completely different from what you imagined. But see the key is… To never give up hope. You just gotta hustle!

[Verse 1: The Asoka]

Wake up in the morning, tired still yawning
Raindrops flowing down, they’re still pouring
Learn from the water, always keep flowing
Life gets hard, imagine being no one
Selling CDs right out of your car
Going up to folks, they don’t know who you are
Trying to express how you feel in a bar
All of this shit in the name of good art
No one believed I could spit this game
Till the magazines came and they pressed my name
Maxim gave me a taste of the fame
Like (Heath) Ledger in the paint, I’ll never be the same
Now my videos be… up on MTV
Little ole me with a free EP
Haters been hating, I’ve been low key
Only my hustle can define me
Paid my dues, made my art
But society still wants to doubt my heart
“You don’t fit in, don’t belong in hip-hop!”
Things like that use to make my heart drop
All this time man it felt like jail
These A&Rs made my life a living hell
“An Indian kid in America well…
Well, that’s something that’ll never sell.”
They made me not want to live anymore
They made me wish that I had plenty dough
Some even said “He ain’t got any flow.”
But God knows, I was born ready thou

[Chorus: Chris Lightfoot]

Yeah, feels like high or low
We’re treading water… treading water
Yeah, will they ever know
How hard we try  (hard we try)
Oh, it’s burning, this yearning
To fly… to fly oh oh
Will they ever know
How hard we try
To bring it to life


[Verse 2: Hittman]

I was chosen (Whaaat?)
Back in 98 I was strolling (Whaaat?)
Back pack full of raps, had goals intact
Flowed at Encore, was a motherfucking wrap
Mel (man) and Big Chuck were like you gotta meet Capt
That’s what they called the Doctor
Interrupted Eve’s session like Cool J in  Krush Grove
When he said “Box!”
Spitting for Andre till he said “Stop!
That’s all I gotta to hear”
Then and right there dreamed of ballin` and gear
All in all an illustrious career
Well I thought wrong, thought I was on, got hella gonged
Now I’m KickStarter pledging like a telethon
For project funding
Sometimes stepping-stones are really blocks for stumbling
Opting out my contract was it a smart or dumb thing
The block is mumbling
My hustle’s not a fun thing, it's stressful and humbling
For real

[Chorus: Chris Lightfoot]

Yeah, feels like high or low
We’re treading water… treading water
Yeah, will they ever know
How hard we try  (hard we try)
Oh, it’s burning, this yearning
To fly… to fly oh oh
Will they ever know
How hard we try
To bring it to life[Intro: Hitman]
(Chipmunk voice)
*Puff puff* This shit hit BeeGee

[BeeGee]
(Chipmunk voice)
Aye, bro chill. Get to the track though my nigga

[Verse 1: Hitman]
(I be on that high shit)
I found out that bitches ain't loyal, nigga I'm over it
Swear she's hot to the touch, but I'm like her oven mitt
Cause I know how to handle
All her friends I made examples
I killed the pussy, killed the smell with a swag candle
Look, my nigga I'm on... whole eighth to myself
Whole eighth with the bros, no eighth for the hoes
I got too much, woah for them bitches; overload
I'm just into my performances, smoke and count my Os
Wrekless representative, I bang it like the set
Throw it up, I'm showing up everytime you heard I was next
I don't slack, bitch I rap; you niggas whack I feel that deeply
Talkin' shit but in my face use (you're) a fan, nigga that's creepy
Ahh, what the fuck is going on around my side of town
Look, them haters keep my laughing fam I love these fuckin' clowns
Look at me now, look at me frowm; mad swag is how I get down
We the best, I'm on one-bitch don't duck, but shots come around
Ahh, get used to this life I live, yo' brain is satisfying
Lose your breath everytime we sex, baby girl is dying
I love the way she get on top and ride me like a stallion
She need some kind of reward, crown or medallion

[Verse 2: BeeGee]
Niggas... be stalkin' bitches in the club
I'm on that hard shit with a bitch, I came to get it up
Velcro type of nigga, cause my attitude just got her stuck
And yes, my conscious is a virgin, cause I just don't give a fuck
Spark the bleether, hit that shit and thump the ashes on her butt
I'm done with the fuckin' conversation, trynna get a nut
I call my bitches 2k, cause I play 'em everyday
I'm all about the struggle, but I'm rappin' like I got it made
I hope you got the memo, I'm about to go national
I let a hatin' nigga talk, his thoughts are so irrational
Sever niggas with the verse, precision is so tactical
I'm on that super star; sparkle sparkle it's so magical
Killin' these niggas with the bars, the style is so imperative
Around the bitches I be cool, around them you're embarrassin'
Runnin' up on this track, because a nigga has endurance
Peep the style, this is Wrekless, now you're useless like insurance

[Verse 3: Hitman]
Look, word to my nigga Otis; I'm Smithers-Smitty
Downtown on a dime for her "hello, kitty"
Bitches wantin' my committee like some brand new titties
Moments never have a name 'til I pull out my Jimmy
I be off that freaky deaky until they comfortable
Then I'm in your wallet, give me paper like I'm punchin' holes
Don't like when it's fishy; no tuna casserole
Wrekless niggas addin' up, swag mathematical

[Verse 4: Jet 2]
Nigga, dick-head fuck you I got ambition
Y'all niggas sittin', sittin' might as well be convalescent
Art of ambition just as long as the watch is tickin'
Clock is tickin', fuck the bitches gettin' in the way of the paper chase
Whip, you see the light in me, nigga I could be a switch
Hitman put money on they head, cause now we got 'em on the hitlist
Lyrics paint just like we drew it, if they ain't signin' they stupid
Them other niggas the Triads and Wrekless be the Yakuzas nigga
They don't kick it like we kick it, nigga you pooch it nigga
You sewage, nigga we music, nigga we do this, nigga
Thought you knew this, nigga like who them niggas?
A group of spitters, Wrekless post like eviction notice
Delivery move them niggas
Crew full of grinders, all we do is think of rails
Stick to the music while the bitches stick to us guess we some nails
I got a fail at multi-tasksing while on the paper
Cause I'm way too one track minded to think of failure, nigga

[Verse 5: Hitman]
I'm from where going in is never a problem
So if a rival feelin' froggy, I got niggas to pause him
Thinkin' they icy, I defrost 'em
Give a fuck what it cost 'em
Turn 'em to water, I go harder; grown shit, I'm a father
And on my unborn daughter, AKA why niggas bother?
I ain't got no time to bother, cause yo mom's up in the shower
Honesty hour, I just take it down, baby twin towers
Then right back to the shower, you feel me pussy is power

[Outro: Hitman]
(Chipmunk voice)
Ahh.. haha ha Pussy is power?
You right, so I'm finna get some right after this track
Whoop!
Whoop!!
Wrekless... haha uhh, uhh
My nigga... my nigga Hitman, my nigga BeeGee... Jet 2? Ha
Wrekless, check this, no guest-list
Swag, swag, swag, swag, whoooDre:
Hittman,2000

[Verse 1 (Dre)]
Comin in stompin,its Hitt from Bronson
In collaboration wit Dre from Compton
Huh,I came to say a lil sumthin (Hittman,2000)
Hittman +At Your Service+
Highly intensive tounge talents makin all nervous
Y'all fakin', I'm 409, wit' my rhymes all purpose
Y'all hatin,popped up wit Dre y'all nervous
Y'all waitin,anticipatin
My arrival California survialist
Smash on any man rival dis

Rappin since '85 think I dont write my shit?
Bitch!,get off my dick!

Hook:
Yes these are,Last Dayz of-my-life
Before I raise (Before i`m out,I want all y'all to say dat nigga) -

Before I raise (Man,I want all y'all to say dat nigga) -
Hittmans tight (But I'll Be Back!)

[Verse 2]
Get on dis verse wit a video endin
Was anyone offended,bout how I shitted?
Im tha real Hitt,ain't no pretend bitch
Rubber grip ten clips,fo starters
When H-I double T spits, it`s a time fo martyrs
Newcomers and forefathers
You wants none of tha unknown author
Part Bunchy Carter half Fred Hamptom
Dressed like a C.O.,sent to hit Charles Manson
Mask and hands covered,straight villin
Make killins,but when Im chillin
Hoes say Hittman's a handsome muthafucka
Granted it`s the  tha Grants that make em fan brothers
Fuck romance,Im a ransom lover
I bag rich bitches,gag em,n tie em up to one-another
(Hittman aight) Im tight enuff to be discovered
By tha WestCoast's,tops,nigga
Tha same guy who found Eminem,Snoop & D.O.C
In 2000,H marks tha spot
See Im tha first Hittman,y'all niggas tryna be tha next Pac
That's when ya lost
Fuck around n get your ass nailed to a cross
If rap was football I would be Randy Moss
Tha hottest nigga favorite cocktail's Molatov
Niggas callin Aftermath like Dre call em of
(Call em off,call em off,call em off)
Im tha reason why ya fallen of
(Fallen off x8)
Hitt-man is,a goin off

Hook[Intro x4]
All these niggas and all these hoes in here
Somebody here gon' fuck

[Verse 1: Hittman]
Talking that, walking that, spitting at hoes
Smoking this, drinking that, gittin` at hoes
Fuck this I'm hitting that I'm hitting em both
Have one riding dick, one licking my toes
When I'm loving these hoes there ain't no love involved
No hugs, no kisses
Bear rugs, bare britches
Rare bitches like them hoes in them Blacktail pictures
Bitch jumped off my dick
Is that Dre over there

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Yeah, I just took some Ecstasy
Ain't no telling what the side effects could be
All these fine bitches equal sex to me
Plus I got this bad bitch laying next to me
No doubt, sit back on the couch
Pants down, rubber on, set to turn that ass out
Laid the bitch out, then I put it in her mouth
Pulled out, nutted on a towel and passed out

[Kurupt]
Come on let's get high, high
Let's get high, high
Come on let's get high, high
Let's get high, all my ladies
Let's get high, high
High, high
Let's get high, high
Come on let's get high

I make the four hop
Pull up at the spot
Weed by the barrels in my G'd up apparel
Stomping in the party
Kurupt, Young Gotti
I'm fucking something in this bitch
Hit 'em with some gangsta shit
Put something in your mouth bitch real tasty
I'm looking real saucy in my gangsta-ass Staceys
Hit the party, ease up, Kurupt with an ounce an'
Got all the hoes in this motherfucker bouncing
Down to

YO WHATTUP SCRAM JONES
Mel-Man what's cracking
Whassup wit all these ol' punk ass hoes in here

[Ms. Roq]
Nigga what, I'm a hustling bitch
I like them get rich niggas
Them hit the switch niggas
Niggas bout the sex and which bitch to hit next
While I'm kicking my game and collecting them checks
Got all y'all niggas vexed to fuck this triple-X rated ho
You say you ain't eat it, you ate it though
Roq don't stop, can't be dropping no drawers
To the niggas how you figure got you shitting in yours
Yeah, little dicks always running they mouth
While a bitch is better off to masturbate and be out
All you bitches up in here know what I'm talkin about
Get the loot, get the ice
Fuck the wife, no doubt
Trying to live lavish
Marry a big dick and stay carried
Holla back at them niggas that hollered at me
Pop the Cris'
Whip the six and shit
And have all y'all niggas limp when I twist my shit
Yeah, bitch ass niggas[Dr. Dre]
Hey, yo whassup?
My name is Dre
Can I blaze some chronic witchu?

[Girl]
Nigga what? FO' SHO'!
Roll that shit up!

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Hell yeah, still "Alwayz Into Somethin'"
Heart still in Compton
The comp can't oppose, dope Cali platinum classicals
Introduced you to my Doggs, that don't love hoes
And Firm Fiascoes - assholes
Fucked you up with my last video, tuxed up
Doing a tango
And cash, always in my grasp
Came up in the game wearin' khakis not kangols, stranglin' hoes
When asked about it in most interviews I just laugh
Now I vacate with hoes with a gang of ass
One feedin' me mangoes, the other lightin' my hash
Rap tabloids write Dre's light in the ass (what?)
Came home uptight, ready to mash
Like a gas pedal, get on that '64 Chevy level
AK-47 heavy metal
Who say Dre ain't ghetto? Just whistle like a tea kettle
I throw three at you, tell me if you see devils
Cause we rebels over here, I smell chronic in the air
That means we takin over this year
You hear?

[Girl] Chronic, two-thousand
[KRS-One] "ONE!" {*echoes*}"
[Dr. Dre] That means we takin' over this year, ya hear?

[Hook: Ms. Roq & Knoc-Turn'al]
Light Speed, blazin' Chronic through the galaxy
Hydro, doja, chocolate Thai weed
Or we might be sippin' on gin or Hennessey
Fuck that, where that new shit, The Chronic Iced Teas?

[Verse 2: Hittman]
I hang among hustlers, that slang and hoo-bang Bronson
When bustaz roll through, can't fuck with my bold crew
We will hold you captive and bust
Cause gangbangin' is the active, activity
Where I be livin, B, there ain't no Liberty Statue
Hope you got your gat, don't let them catch you
Slippin, without yours, it's warfare outdoors
Ambulance, violent uproars
Trash niggas takin out like chores I meet whores on tours
Jeanie`s hot as pepper so I sip, champagne on stormy shores
B on some hardcore, pornographic
Toting Austrian firearms that's made out of plastic
In these drastic surroundings, it be sounding like Lebanon
Makin' fools "RETREAT!" like Megatron and Starscream
Oh yeah I scream-on-stars
That get loot then crossover like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
Get out your car son, that's how I came to bougie niggas
At bar one, it's either that or make front page stardom
I'm the Golden Child, chased by Sardo Numpsay
But God`s my bulletproof, it's hard to shoot me you hear?

(By the time you see him {*BLAM BLAM*})
That means it's real fuckin hard to shoot me, you hear?

[Hook: Ms. Roq & Knoc-Turn'al][Hittman]
When darkness be closin in
I motivate, with the howlin wind
With a list of chosen men, frozen in sin
Knowin that your end is beginnin
Swift silent and deadly
There's no defending my plots, I know your every movement
For six months I watch, coulda gotchu at your baby's mother's house
Even at your down-low weed spot
But the backdrop, wasn't flattering enough
I didn't want people gathering and stuff {*cameras click*}
Snapshots of blood splattering from the snuff
Here - puff this here, while I figure which way, to split yo' wig
Right now you as nervous, as a Farmer John pig
As I dig into my tragic bag, take out the HK
Twist on the silencer, insert the thirty-shot mag {*WHOOSH*}
Bullet stuck to his brain like a magnet
Skull in fragments, I leave the cleanup to Dragnet

(Hook- Hittman)

This is anybody (MURDERAHHH)
To fuckin everybody (MURDERAHHH)
Nigga all y'all (MURDERAHHH)
Uh, uh, for real
You'll fuck around and get killed
This is anybody (MURDERAHHH)
Motherfuckin everybody (MURDERAHHH)
Yeah nigga all y'all (MURDERAHHH)
Uh, uh, for real
You'll fuck around and get killed

[Ms. Roq]
Peeped all the stash drop and exchange of the dough
Lurkin through the turf, think how I'mma just work
Give em chase to the crib and yo he properly laced
Stepped out the car, put my steel, to the side of his face
Murder - this the fuckin Case, rob this nigga and shake
The fuckin spot cause in a few it's gon' be crawlin with cops!
Who's the bad bitch now, you crept on, paid the piper
Who'da thought a sexy bitch could be a murderous sniper
Detrimental to your health, shoulda learned yo' lesson
But it's too late nigga bye-bye, better count yo' blessings
I been watchin you watchin me, yeah you ballin
Was, nigga now you finger fucked and steady fallin
A thug wit no love, but bitch niggas die fast
Thug niggas die young - oh what you thought you would last?
Blast two shots to the dome, slide back to the pad
And jack my nigga off, til his dick get soft
Resume the wifey boo shit, cause yo my man don't know
That his bitch is straight ill, servin ass with fo'fo' {*KABOOM*}

(Hook- Ms. Roq)

I'm a motherfuckin (MURDERAHHH)
Bitch this is anybody (MURDERAHHH)
Yeah nigga all y'all (MURDERAHHH)
Uh, uh, for real
You'll fuck around and get killed
I'm a motherfuckin (MURDERAHHH)
Uhh bitch this is anybody (MURDERAHHH)
Yeah nigga all y'all (MURDERAHHH)
Uh, uh, for real
You'll fuck around and get killed! {*echoes*}[Intro: Dr. Dre]
Yeah
Not many days left (Bring that shit)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Too much stress can make a nigga hesitate with no time left
(I feel blessed though)
Here we go to the next
A Dr. Dre exclusive with music bruising your neck (What the fuck)
Rip your plans up, Dre's ruling
You don't want to fuck around with the hands, let alone the gun foolin'
Like De La had niggas plug tunin'
Me and L had niggas zooming, me and Snoop flew the coup
Me keep your asses moving, with that hot shit
Club niggas like to request this around-the-clock shit
But I do it for my (hood niggas)
With rockets
Who learned how to survive and fatten them pockets
With 'x' amount of dollars the ballers, crime pays
But that snake shit'll leave that ass in a pine grave
Rocking project halls, from your sound-proof stalls
Got all you motherfuckers screaming "Yes yes y'all"

[Verse 2: Hittman]
All we need is 40 ounces and a tool to rule
In city duels used to buck fifty fools
Now I let off like white kids in elementary schools
Hit the news like Stacey Koon to Rodney crazy as a looney tune
Kids watch me, bitches jock me for this shit
Cause Hittman's the breaker of the monotony
For a faker man I won't shake your hand
Instead I'll shake like  land on which you stand like maracas in a mariachi band
Got my love back for this shit
Like  Joanie for Chachi now I'm a cocky man again
So I ride like the wind
In a fly Sedan Benz
Hanging out the window when I turn left to watch my rims spin
Ha, that line got my friends grinnin'
The fine bitches got my ends spendin'
The gin got my mind bendin'
In LA I stay balling like Lorenzen Wright
Lost angels sin at night
And I floss on the timid type
Dominique Dawes on that ass
End your night[Hook]
I hope you good with what you got
But it's a whole world think outside of your box (nigga think outside of yo box)
Don't be begging for no help
You got this, Gotta build some for yourself (gotta build some for yourself)
Even if you don't see it in your vision
You going hard, all you need to be is consistent (niggas gotta be consistent)
And when they try to bring you down
You turn around, you turn it up, and then hold it down (then hold it down)

[Verse 1]
Rapping 'bout my life
Rapping 'bout the life they soon to like
I like these lights but on my life I ain't the type
That want to kick it with the homies all the time
Sitting around wasting time, whenever everybody wanna shine
Niggas is going blind, obviously cause we ain't moving the same
We been stuck in one place, but we ain't doing a thang
It's time to think outside the box you staying true to your name
It's the image you trying to resemble gon' have you going insane
I'm trying to think different, my hidden gifts I know they exist
It's a whole world, you just need a list and know they exist
I mean the fist that I be holding is a token to these youngin's
So in faith for you to appreciate the blessings you got coming
You don't see them yet, all good he wake up like he don't know need a check
We just want to live and learn, progression for my people back
I see the traps, legal craft, they're quick to hold us down
That's why I'm in my Trayvon hoodie with a smile
And I'm here to let the world know..

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Ayo fuck the media they twisting turning the truth
Give us bits and pieces of the proof, making it cool
I mean what's giving to these kids is cruel
And I'm unsure if they'll accept the lyrics we endure
Now moving forward a little more in detail with the chorus
Yeah you record but have you ever open other doors
I mean there's sports but then theirs more then what you niggas think
That quick money got ya'll moving at that nigga pace
I want ya'll to open your minds spread your wings and prosper
You too worried about what niggas think cause shit get awkward
Niggas know I been there before with a rep to uptain as I strain to grow
With nothing to show but a new change of clothes
We was learning life, experience shit that almost earned my life
I seen that cop beated my nigga I fell hopeless with a burning knife
Had I hit him with a right, I wouldn't be here on this mic
It's just a sign that our blessings gon' over shine
And you my nigga

[Hook][MC Ren]
Yeah nigga, MC Ren up in this motherfucker
(West West y'all)
Yeah, L.A. niggas
L.A. niggas rule the world nigga
Y'all niggas gotta recognize, yaknahmsayin?
Niggas don't wanna peep game, yaknahmsayin?
But this shit come all the way back around here
My nigga Dre, droppin' heat box on y'all bitch-ass
Yaknahmsayin? You gotta recognize
L.A. niggas, connected all over the motherfucking world, nigga
Recognize this; peep game

[Time Bomb]
Now in my younger days I used to sport a rag
Backpack full of cans plus a four-four mag
G'd up from the feet up
Blue'd up from the shoe up's how I grew up
Loc'n, smokin' and drinkin' til we threw up (threw up)
At Leimert Park, taggin', hittin' fools up
Ditching my class, just to fuck yo' school up
You don't wanna blast, nigga tuck yo' tool up
But don't sleep, y'all niggas quick to shoot you
Now there's another motherfucker with no future
But Time Bomb much smoother when I maneuver, dope like Cuba
Got em jumpin Disciples to the Hoover

[King T]
I'm coming "Straight Outta Compton" with a loose cannon
Smoke big green, call it Bruce Banner
Watch your manners, at last another blast from the top notch
From way back with the pop rocks, I pop lock witcha
Picture this, Dr. Dre twisting wit Tha Liks
And Hittman bought a fix
Don't trip, it's a Time Bomb in this bitch
Here it tick tick tick tick {*BOOM*}
Wait a minute it's on, I tell it like a true mackadelic
Weed and cocaine sold separate, check it
From sundown to sunup -- clown and run up
The Aftermath'll be two in your gut, nigga what?

Chorus: Knoc-Turn'al, Kokane

We roll deep, smoke on weed drink and pack heat
Requirements for survival each day -- in L.A.!
It don't stop, we still mash in hot pursuit from the cops
Analyze why we act this way -- in L.A.!

[Hittman]
Gimme that mic fool, it's a West coast jack move
They call me Hitt - cause I spit like gats do
Cock me back
Bust caps for my Macz Crew, at Fairfax
Who used to wear Air Max shoes, that's true
But I grew up where niggas jack you, harass you
Blast you, for that set you claim (where you from?)
Mash on you for your Turkish chain, C.K. B.K
Blue'd up or flame, I ran wit a gang
I helped niggas get, jacked for they Dana Dane's
My pants hang below my waistline
I look humble wanna rumble? (yeah yeah)
I bang though, like Vince Carter from the baseline
Don't waste my time
Fuck a scrap in killa Cali, AK's and 9's
One-time's, sun-shines, and fine-ass bitches
Hawaiian Thai, drive-bys, six-fo's on switches

[Xzibit]
I was raised in the hood called WHAT-THE-DIF'
Where the brothers in the hood, refused to go Hollywood
Slugs for the fuck of it
Anybody hatin' on us can suck a dick
If I catch you touching mine you catch a flat-line, dead on the floor
Better than yours, driving away gettin' head from a whore
It's AvireX-to-the-Z
Fuckin' with me might get you banned from TV
Cassette and CD it's all mine the whole nine the right time
Multiply, we don't die, the streets don't lie
What, so neither do I, I'm bad for your health
Like puttin' a pistol up to your face and blastin' yourself

[Defari]
Five in the mornin', burglars at my do'
Glock forty-five in my dresser drawer
Let 'em come in BLAOW he see the thunder roll
Roll with niggas, who buy fifths by the fo'
And brew's by the case
SLAP YOU in the face with the bass, Dr. Dre laced
Likwit Kings wit Sedans and gold rings
Haters fold the style, but can't find no openings

Chorus

[Outro]
In L.A

That's how we ride (4X)[Intro: Phish]
What's the difference between me and you (repeat 2x)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Back when Cube was rolling with Lorenzo in a Benzo
I was bangin' with a gang of instrumentals
Got the pens and pencils
Got down to business; but sometimes
The business end of this shit can turn your friends against you
But you was a real nigga
I could sense it in you
I still remember the window of the car that you went through
That's fucked up, but I'll never forget the shit we been through
And I'ma do whatever it takes to convince you
Cause you my nigga Doc, and Eazy I'm still wit'chu
Fuck the beef, nigga I miss you
And that's just being real wit'chu
You see the truth is
Everybody wanna know how close me and Snoop is
And who I'm still cool with
Then I got these crap-ass niggas I first drew with
Claimin' that they non-violent, talkin' like they Ruthless
Spit venom in interviews, speaking on reunions
Move units, then talk shit and we can do this
Until then - I ain't even speaking your name
Just keep my name outta yo' mouth and we can keep it the same, nigga
It ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors
It's just that I'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em
That's the difference

[Hook: Phish] (x2)
What's the difference between me and you
You talk a good one
But you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to living big dog style and straight coasting

[Verse 2: Hittman]
The difference is: I don't care
Can't you tell it by my rigid stare?
I'm legendary, get you open like a Frigidaire
More despair, your style's dead as Fred Astaire
You need medicare, security blanket and a fucking teddy bear
Awh yeah, awh yeah
Is your expression when you eyewitness a session
Vocal pitch making impressions like Jerry Butler
Stupid fucker, I will cut ya
Doing a sucka's such a tragedy, I'll run you raggedy like Ann
You'll kick the pink can like a faggoty man
New styles, I usually keep clandestine
Like files of semen found in J. Edgar Hoover's intestines
No question
But keep that on the low low, Falana slow mo
When puffing marijuana couldn't get the time of day
Now I'm fucking nigga's Mommas
Drama's still part of my dietary
Hit hard like Singletary
Kill your daughter, bust her cherry

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Aight, hold up hold up
STOP THE BEAT A MINUTE
I got somethin' to say
Dre, I wanna tell you this shit right now while this fucking weed is in me
(What the fuck?)
I don't know if I ever told you this, but I love you dawg
I got your motherfucking back (right) just know this shit

[Dr. Dre]
Slim, I don't know if you noticed it
But I've had your back from day one nigga
Let's blow this bitch

[Eminem]
I mean it dawg, you ever need somebody offed - whose throat is it?

[Dr. Dre]
Well if you ever kill that Kim bitch
I'll show you where the ocean is

[Eminem]
Well that's cool, and I appreciate the offer
But if I do decide to really murder my daughter's momma
I'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her
And cruise around with her for seven hours through California
And have her wavin at people (hi)
Then drop her off on the corner
At the police station and drive off honkin' the horn for her
Raw dawg, get your arm gnawed off
Drop the sawed off and beat you with the piece it was sawed off of
Fuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up
Get shot up in the hot tub 'til the bubbles pop up
And they nose and cough snot up
Mucus in hot water
That's for trying to talk like "The Chronic" was lost product
That's for even thinking of having them thoughts thought up
You better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up
So what's the difference between us
We can start at the penis
Or we can scream
"I Just Don't Give a Fuck," and see who means it

[Hook]
