Artist: Lin Que f/ MC Lyte
Album:  Let it Fall 7"
Song:   Let it Fall (Ses Remix)

Verse One: Lin Que

Uhh, now we got nutcrackers, body snatchers, and heart attackers
Mine the three combined, plus other tactics
I kick more flips, than acrobatics
So your plastic, couldn't get one charge to my dramatics
Don't pack it, got friends that'll let you have it
Don't start it, or else I have to grab it
Insane killer, my pain is out my brain
A dried up skull remains, another MC slain
Who been in the ciphers, I'm the lighter with the fire
You're purple, goin in circles like those Goodyear tires
Liars and labels on the other side of tables
When I-yah rebels I be kickin more channels than the cables
I'm ready willing and able to end your lifeline
Your windpipe's mine cause I'm inclined to kick the right rhyme
So very hardcore that you hit the hard floor
I score, when I do jacks I'm like in car doors

I let it fall on em, I let it fall on em (repeat 3x)
[MC Lyte] And drop it all on em, drop it all on em

Verse Two: MC Lyte

I lets it all fall down just like the rain
I scream your name but you better maintain
They all want more, they all want it raw
Well then baby hit the floor, it's time for round four
Keepin it hot, givin you the best that I got
You got the navigational plans, to my G spot
I reckon we can take it just a little bit slower
Like this beat we can all fall down on these white sheets
Life is grand when there's money in your hand
And a man by your side that's down witcha plan
But I'm in-dependent, yes I am
I make my own money, I rock my own jam
I drive my own ride and I buy my own gear
So when I hit it then I quit then I beez up outta there
I tried to warn him that I, wouldn't call him
But I, I had to jet and let it all fall on him

I let it fall on em, I let it fall on em (repeat 3x)
[MC Lyte] And drop it all on em, drop it all on em
I let it fall on em, I let it fall on em (repeat 3x)
[MC Lyte] And drop it all on em, drop it all on em

Verse Three: Lin Que

Now we got clowns, then I throw em down in instant replay
When I'm heated up I speed it up like a freeway
Your DJ, is coming, summon your creator
The life fader, complex to me like alpha beta
Collectin data, you're gonna need it to defeat me
Some tried to sweep me off my feet, they must be sleepy
You're gonna have to bring it stronger than that
I'm on to your rap, and damn not the cornier crap
So chill before blood spills under the victim
My verse'll pimp all, and it'll kill when I say sick em
See I can vic em bout a crowd of a million
The villain, illin, not only here to make a killin
You're under pressure off the hardcore texture
The wrecker, will hear my steps when I come to get ya
Stunts who talk that junk I never front
If you talk all that you hunt then I'ma give you what you want

I let it fall on em, I let it fall on em (repeat 3x)
[MC Lyte] And drop it all on em, drop it all on em
I let it fall on em, I let it fall on em (repeat 3x)
[MC Lyte] And drop it all on em, drop it all on em[Intro]

[Verse 1: Timid]
No more excuses, we have proved that we'll get through it
If we do it in a union of congruent focused movements
You see, the field is open for true hoping of the masses
What's real is the notion of success through a passion
A unity of you and me, a view of trees, and a sunset
Memories of slavery but we're not done yet
We stood in wait for dawn to break and the sun to rise
Because the son don't rise if the sun don't rise
But I, can hear the future calling and I'm answering
Talking to the past and then laughing because we won't go back again
Asking them what's the best course of action and
It's no matter what the game, hit the lane and just win
Pour liquor for homeys and water on your seed
To honor the past and pass it on to the new breed
So yes I'm dancing on the 50-yard line
Not because it's my song but because it's that time

[Hook: Rachel Walker]
You know it's time to get with it
No doubt gone rise
Don't get left behind, go get it
Can't stop, won't stop
Follow your dreams and rise up to the top
It's that time, you're time
So don't stop

[Verse 2: Lin Que]
They told me the revolution will not be televised
But I done seen it with my own eyes on 1-2-0-0-9
After the Apostle's Creed, after we hung on trees
They are hanging on our words so we're quoting Socrates
No human condition is ever permanent 
So we done rose out of the ashes like a phoenix in the wind
I hope you understand that you can come with an ocean
But you cannot drown out the fire that stays blazing from within
The L to the I to the N, The Q to the U to the E
It is what you believe if you believe then you will see
It's all up in your mind, Lin Que, Timid, the seventh sign
Spitting visine to the pupils, Helen Keller to the blind
I'm gentle when I write but I'm a dragon when I rhyme
So when I'm spitting on the mic it's assault and battery like alkaline
To non-believers and deceivers left behind
My case in point, like porcupines

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Timid]
It's not a celebration of the end of a mission
It's admission that we can bend our wishes into submission
It's the air of a new pathway, Cube's good day
Whitney believing in children and love songs of Sade
We can look in the eyes of a hopeful youth
And say you have unlimited possibilities and it's truth
It took a nation of millions and that was that facts
But now, not one of those men can hold us back
I can see what can be achieved if we
Grind like we're trying to push a mix tape CD
Stop looking up upon those who should be looked down on
And letting yourself be a sacrificial piece like a pawn
Let's keep it strong, remember that block is not yours
So stop living under its laws and get something much more
Opportunity's at the door and I've said it before
That we are the ones that we have been waiting for

[Hook]

[Outro][Chorus: N-Tyce (DV's) {La the Darkman}]
We all Rap Scholars, we dimes amount to dollar
Anything less than a mill', don't even bother
What we out for? (Makin' paper)
Eh-yo, tell 'em about the long run (An hour later)
{Yo, check my hit women, the Power-U make niggas keep sinnin'
You think you blowin' back but you just swimmin'
Official Queen Bees, Wu Deadly Venom
Yo sting 'em!}

[Champ MC]
Been in this rap game for mad long, mad long, mad long
Long enough to rock like this
From the projects, since sunsets
Society like a Bomb Threat, still livin' as a convict
Cause a conflict, out to get yours, tryin' to get wreck
Breakin' ya neck to earn respect
On the mission, bet you fall like the composition
And the competition better off playin' ya distance
My Venom position, my miracles
Like a magician, it be that pull ya be pissin'
The main rendition, hittin' you right on the spot
Your feet'll drop, we hot, fuck the rest
We the ones that can't be stopped

[Jamie Sommers]
Uh!
Been in this rap game mad long, mad long, mad long
Long enough to kill it like this
Bust the blessin', fertile crescent, verbal weapon
Lyrically lace up the track with crews, I start the essence
My confession, ill thoughts, roof tops
Seed on the my back pack, tied boots, the napsack
Fatigue'll bring CREAM, stashed up in the seams
Runnin' the illest caper, not for paper
But for good behavior, Christ that bear, originator
Livin' out a dream, they scheme, in army green
With disgustin' lust, approachin' me, and slay lyrical scene
A light, snatch up mic's, unify my wisdom team
Supreme, high oxen team, come Killa Beez
I'm born to dwell in the West, chill in the East
Deadly Venoms on the come up with the sting
Like dope to a fiend, we all seen

[Chorus]

[Finesse (La the Darkman)]
Been in this rap game mad long, mad long, mad long
Long enough to freak it like this
Mysterious like Finesse & Synquis
Thought I was Uptown kickin' it, just makin' the hits
Puttin' on the Ritz, havin' occassional fits
Cuz this thorough chick rippin' niggas thinkin' they slick
So I play 'em like a pimp play a trick
Don't show yo without my dough ho, see that's a no-no
We rock it too long, this ain't a promo
Take a photo, too many years, drop a vocal
Throwin' choke holds, I'm loco
Word on the streets is that I rip mad beats, pack heats
But y'all been gettin' too deep, my life's steak
Word on the same day is Mary J
Let me know, every day it rains but the CREAM'll come away
So I maintain, don't stress the brain
Even though, once before I thought my ass was framed
Thought niggas wasn't tryin to see Fi-Fi rock
(They still come up sayin' Soul Sistas was hot)

[N-Tyce]
Been in this rap game mad long, mad long, mad long
Long enough to freak like this
Lyricist, never sleep, I be that chick who creap
High-pitched country accent up on the beat
Up on the freak, nah, I'm doin' other things
Undercover things, we the 4th Lethal Weapon, Danny Glover name
Aim for the best, never no less
Never no stress, like I'm mad thick on this flesh
Thick on his chest, slick with his stress, you know the rest
Guaranteein' y'all to God bless
Progress with positivity, steady takin' out the enemy
Yo I've got to have the whole world feelin' me

[Chorus - La the Darkman only]

[J-Boo]
Yo, yo, yo, yo
I been in this rap game for mad long, mad long, mad long
Long enough to rip like this
Well let me spark this, rebel bitch that be heartless
Cuttin' niggas down with the sharpness
QB rebel, known to do dirt, take you to the next level
Venomous style just like a devil
Wreckin' hard with all wicked flows that go
Keepin' chickenheads on they toes, fuck my foes
I got mad moves to make, stack this cake
You can catch me at my show in the next state
Spittin' venom at you crumbs, collectin' my funds
We come to rock it 'til it's all done

[Lin Que]
Been in this rap game mad long, mad long, mad long
Long enough to rock it like this
Malik links chokin' up when I spit
Still too slickly, we leavin' fluids leakin'
Even the meetin' they puzzled cuz of the muzzle
Smellin' trouble, seein' double, right before the struggle
Throwin' fist up, lockin' clicks up
Left a dick up for attempt to stick up
Ask RZA he know Venom and Lin Que flow
Little somethin' lethal, custom mad for the people
Unequal..Step 1 to the 2		(4x)

Yeah
Rrrah

[ VERSE 1: MC Lyte ]
I'm a big shot, hot shot, gimme one shot, I wreck shop

I'm on the type of... that makes a... wanna give it up
So what's up with the logics?
It's the L to the E, and you hear me in the projects
And I didn't get hard yet, so dodge it
Watch me enlarge it, I'ma roadhog it
So you think you can get with me?
(It's the L to the E) Why don't you step to me?
(It's the L to the E) Why don't you step to me?

You'll never die of boredom
You'll only hear my floor them
Cause I'm on them, I'm in there, so prepare to live it up
I'm on the type of shit that make a bitch wanna give it up

And you think you can get with me?

[ VERSE 3: Kink E-Z ]

So you wanna hang with dreadlocks? Yes, I got the street smarts
Ugh, through the air like Jordan
You'll never die of boredom
You'll only hear my floor them
Cause I'm on them, and in there, so prepare to give it up
I'm on the type of shit that make a bitch wanna give it up
So what's up with the logics?

(It's the Kink to the E) Don't step to me
(It's the Kink to the E) Don't step to me
