[Sample: Notorious B.I.G]
It's the ones that smoke blunts with ya, see ya picture
Now they wanna grab the guns and come and get ya

[Intro]
Yeah, one time for the homie DJ Screw
Already, I'm feeling throwed in this bitch

[Verse 1]
I'm so high even when I'm coming down
Just met a girl say she from the H-Town
I say my name is Drizzy and ain't nobody realer
Cup inside a cup, smoking Ghostface Killah
Got these boppas going crazy, nigga I'm the man
I sent ya girl a message, said I'll see ya when I can
She sent me one back, but I ain't never read it
Cause pussy's only pussy and I get it when I need it

[Verse 2]
I'm telling you, I'm as cold as windows down in the winter
And I be riding rims if my tires any thinner
Airport stunting, flying charters overseas
Full of Dom Perignon and the water for the D's
Don't know why it happens, everytime we alone
But here we are again and I swear I'm in my zone
So I'm a sip this drank until that mothafucka gone
And you gon' get undressed and we gon' get it on

[Hook]
I don't give you the time, you deserve from me
This is something I know, I know, I know
So tonight I'll just fuck you like we're in Houston
Taking everything slow, so slow, so slow but I do it to her

[Bridge]
Draped up, dripped out, know what I'm talking 'bout
3 in the morning, get it popping in the parking lot
It's on once again and I never pretend
A nigga staying G 'til the end

[Outro]
Ay, yeah, I swear like everytime we find ourself in this situation
You know, I just get that feeling like I'm in Houston
Candy paint switching colors in the light
It's about like 11 p.m. and you just rolling through the city
Bumping that Screw, Big Moe, UGK, Lil' Keke
It feels like everything's just moving slow
Let's take my time, I pace it baby, yeah, I'm gone[Intro: Big Moe]

It's time I just chill and lay back and sip a 8
I'm sittin' sideway
TV on tha scrape plate
They don't hate when they see
We coming, we don't fuss
We don't even cuss
We swanga's on the bus: Damn!(Pocket Full of Stones - by UGK is in the background mix)
"I got a pocket fulla stones"

[Lil Keke]
I'm draped up and dripped out
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Three in the mornin', gettin' the gat out the stash spot
Fire up a fat sweet
Turnin' on the bulb lights
Hand on the wood grain
Ass on the tight white
Showin' naked ass in the great state of Texas
Home of the players, so there'll never be no plexin'
So long we've been waitin'
Never ever hatin'
In Houston we Elbows, In Cali they Daytons
So 1996 you hoes better duck
Because the world gon' drip candy and be all Screwed Up
Just pop in your grey cassette
Turn up your fuckin' deck
Lend me your ear because the Southside finna wreck
Down here we smoke tree
Then let the world see
True hidden talent like Screw, and Lil Keke
Ain't no love for hatas and you busted big suckas
On the south side we stayin' paid MuthaFucka!

(Pocket Full of Stones - by UGK is in the background mix)
"I got a pocket fulla stones"
"...And they won't leave my ass alone"

[DJ Screw]
Lil Keke gone and tell 'em what time it is...

[Lil Keke]
It's time to lay 'em down like a fresh set of dominoes
For all the playas, all the pimps, all the bitches, and all the hoes
Who's the man, who's the boss
Who's the nigga that's payed the cost
I really don't give a damn cause I ain't the one that's gonna take the loss
Grippin' a grand up in the slab, workin' the wood it's understood
Flippin these Rolls, and slammin' these doors
Pullin' these hoes and wearin' these clothes
Who in the the hell was able to tell the southside they had to chill
From hittin' tha boulevards from belts and buckles, woman and grill
I'm poppin' the trunk and smokin' a skunk and pullin' up candy red
Sittin' on bucks, not givin' a fuck and able to turn a head
Somethin' serious when I let go cause I got a way with words
I'm able to clown when using a noun to take the place of verbs
My lyrics go together like a pair of socks and shoes
My flow is slow because it's bolted down by DJ Screw
Take it from me, the nigga Lakee, the H, the A, the R and D
Menace to society
Born and raised to be a G
I grabs the 'phone go on and on
2 or 3 songs I won't postpone
Cause these lyrics comin' from the very top of my dome
So many ways it pays, If you can flip the script
By movin ya tongue, you take a dose and listen close, promise that you'll be sprung
Jacker's and hustler's, player's and mack's
Foreign doors and Cadillacs
Serve codeine that makes you lean and killer sweets rolled out the stacks
All these thangs remain tha same because I'm so able to win
All around just bow down
Because Lil Keke pimps tha pen[DJ Screw talking]
H-Town know what I'm sayin?

[Verse 1: Towdown]
I'm from the land of longhorn and cattle
We ride leather and wood
Seatbelts with saddles
Chrome wagon wheel carriages with candy paint
From the tumbling weed we been blowin dank
From sun up to sun down
I lost that blood that's cold
I'm 100 for 100
6 shooters let em know
My duro stay lit
My peeps be shinin
Wanted dead red posters all ova the city I been robbin
Ain't no decidin when I'm ridin
I'm sluggin the chain
Southside strangler rangler
Draw arm and stranger
The days are hot and long
The nights are restless
All my ex's live in the best little whore house in Texas
The devil's ridin dirty from Georgia to Tooasis
I'm not Garth Brooks but I got friends in low places
Howlin South is 1
Packin gats and stackin 1's
Gotta know when to walk away
And know when to run

[Hook: Joe Slaughter]
The Dirty South is what it's about
Poin up smokin out
Keepin it hot like the middle of June
It's the Texas Tycoons makin country rap tunes

Mr. ballin parlay
And smoke my life away
H-Town superstar
Sippin soda mixed with barre
Thought you never hear my lyrics over a bass guitar
My horses are cars

And my wagon is a 4.6 Range Rover
The game is over
Settin them trends

Rap game John Wayne

Shinin and grindin
Feel me?
Representin that 3rd Coast
We hold the mostSouth Park
Said I'm 'bout to lose my mind

[Scratches]

Every time I wake up, I give the swisha sweet a hit
Sometimes I feel I just can't survive without that lick
Hustlers use my beeper for unnecessary dealings
So when we work we die from killers work be killing
Punk mother-fakers take the pranksta for a joke
So how you gon' play a South Park og full of smoke, fool
I'm a head banger, ex banger, and when you enter
The South Park chamber, you in danger
Beware of him who, walk behind the corn
Cause my brain was designed in my frame before I was ever born
And you was right, when you said I had a head with no screws
But it was tight, when I stopped facing them hip hop blues (boom)
How you gon' say I can't play with the big boys
And all the big boys play with all my Tonka toys
You better flip the script and get with this
And if that buddha don't do ya, then go dippin' (yeah)
Take a walk through this jungle
And you can follow me all the way to Chi, if you want to
But you ain't know me 'til I got bank
So that explains, when you approach me
My mind went blank

[Hook]

It's hard to think, when my mind goes blank
You just can't think when your mind goes blank
[x4]

In this game, hangin' with my crew
Robbing everybody, hell, I might've robbed you
Taking care of mines, keepin' my homeys tight
Sharing what was mines, cause I ain't no jealous type
But still I get hype, and fight back when you back stab
I'll grab you straight by the neck and DDT you to the slab
Now here you go, you got me all physical
Now I'm in court, trying to tell the judge that I'm a lyrical
Freight train, gotta maintain game in this free world
Life is change, niggas stay the same but I'll make your head twirl
You really don't know me, your honor
To make a story short, in the end I'm a goner
You move you lose in the game homey and I'm searching for my come up
Life's a melting pot, don't move Point Blank won't put his gun up
Outsiders try to read me but they don't know me
Point Blank, label my lifestyle "OG"
Cook County, Chicago and Houston
South Park [?] the clan, I'm boostin'
To be frank, let me hit the dank before you take me to the tank
Allah I thank
My mind went blank

[Hook]

I'm gonna briggity, briggity break it on down
To the noise
So best believe I'm a clown
On this hella fire track that [?] hooked up
I came in and dropped the vocals and [?] did a cut
Now we gon' freak it the way it's supposed to be freaked
So when I speak don't be afraid to say that other track weak
Over in the streets I hear fiends like, "Point Blank a trick"
The same mouth it came out, the same mouth that I hit
Oh, did I tell you? How I knock jaws in the dirt
I let him player hate in my face and then I hit em' where it hurts
Yeah you, damn fool spread my business through the hood
And I'm here to let you know that it ain't all good
You came to the hospital to cheer a brotha up
Soon as you left, went through the hood and tried to tear my name up
But I'm finna set it straight, that other day
What really went on, I tried to kill myself fool
So to me wasn't nothing wrong
So next time you wanna be a Howard Cosell
Go run and tell the hood how my brother [?]
Finished up your girl, aight then
On the [?] I'm laughing all the way to the bank
This grudge is forever, forgive never
My mind went blank

[Lil' Flip]
I represent H-Town, down for my block
I started off the game, with the Botany Big Shots

Fucked with E.S.G., and I had to buy the house
Did a lot of shows, represented for the South
Made a little group, called H.S.E
Dropped a tape, and we sold bout 23
Thousand fucking units, now we doing better
Dropped The Leprechaun, and I got a lot of cheddar
Sold a hundred thousand, made about a million
Now I got a Jag, with DVD's in the ceiling
Just got a deal, with Scarface
Now everybody hating, but they smiling in my face
They call me Lil' Flip, I'mma stay true
Got a mic with a crown, say R.I.P. Screw

[Hook: Ronnie Spencer - 2x]

[H.A.W.K.]
I wish, I wish, I wish
I didn't have to write to this, recite to this
Blow a square flight to this, but Screw you missed
All I can do is sit back, and reminisce
It was all good times, at the crib spitting rhymes
Put it on our mind, that we were destined to shine
From scratching on turn tables, to running a record label
Mixing 2Pac and Biggie, with some Kane & Abel
We formed a click, that couldn't be fucked with
You ran the Hardest Pit, with the Dead End Click
It was E.S.G., Lil Keke, Big Pokey, G-R-A-C-E
Your Boy Al-D, P-A-T
C-Note and Willean, and them boys from Botany
You brought in Big Moe, my nigga Z-Ro
Mike D and Clay-Do, Lil' Flip and Lil' O
Them boys from the Fo', them boys from the Tre
And last but not least, there was H-A-W-K
I having nothing else to say, but you were so real
And that's the way you make me feel

[Hook: Ronnie Spencer - 2x]

[Grace]
Screw was my DJ, and that boy was so real
Introduced me to the mic, put me on dubs showing skills
Went from block bleeder, pimping pens staying paid
Baptized in the click, writing rhymes living leid
Had to pay my dues, wreck 25 screws
Put it down with the best, label me one of the trues
V.T. from S.U.C., and I still stand tall
G-R-A-C-E, gon represent it till I fall
Still do it with the click, staying thoed in the mix
Got it by my DJ, fa sho to turning crumbs to bricks
Escape from the dark, now let the light shine through
Although he up above, the Don still come through
Push my pen keep it real, esperbertion sharpened skills
Motivation, determination to get that house on the hill
Ever since the day we met, with me and Los kept it rue
So for that until we gone, stay acting bad jamming Screw

(Ooooh, ooh, ooh, ooooh, yeah)
(nothing like that G ride, baby, yeah!)
(nothing like that G riiide, yeah, oooh yeah!)

[Verse 1: ESG]
Up, early, to wash my face
Probation was the place
Before I blow out tha door, vibration on my waist
Now that’s my fool, what’s the rule?
Go to jail if I miss?
I might as well post bail, cuz ima fail If I piss
I hit the highway, the fly way, as the wind blows
I got that indo, some gin ho
So I’m gonna spin vogues. (ooh, wee, baby, yeeah)
And blowin’, while this pimp game is steady showin
Sun beamin and screamin, while these slim things is strollin
High shinin green the skunk, we some fiends for the funk
Im cracking the ground in, these poundin’ four 15’s in my trunk
Cuz ima baller til I die, I think I’ll call her cuz im high, (cuz im high)
Late night hype so tight, these suckas be goin’ down, I can’t lie
But I’m right about now, dem hoes is gone so it’s on
Might as well just get gone and get, like, trapped in the zone. (the zone)
Cuz I got tha automatic fo’ the static inside
I’m getting fried and high, (im getting fried, baby)
Mothafucka, it’s nothing but a g ride

Chorus x 4

I hit a, curb, swiggity swerve, see u fiendin’ fo’ it
Folks scream, “it’s smoke!” sun beamin’ locs
But I let the top down, I can’t stop now
15’s bang, about to knock the block down
U wanna see the E? then ima hit cha
The mack 11 hit cha, while the rotweiler bit cha
(??) devils do drop, with a new Glock
It’s a red, not a blue dot, slowed down 2Pac
Fingerprints and dirty sheets (slowed down, slowww down, yeah) on the first day
Celebrate my birthday, in tha worst way
I’m on lock, no block, no boys on my block
The dope case in my face, the fence was too high to hop
The matchbox of rocks, now crooked cops can’t stop, (nothing but that G ride, baby)
Lord, help a young nigga make it to his next box
Smoking a sweet, poking at freaks got me weak inside, (oh baby!)
Locked up for 18 months, but I ain’t crunk
It’s nothing but a G ride

Chorus x 4(*DJ Screw*)
Year 2G DJ Screw, Corleon what's the motherfucking deal
(shit trying to figure out, what we gon hit these hoes with
For this last song baby), nigga fuck it I got some'ing
Let's go on pull that ol' hell raiser shit, know I'm saying
(no shit, some of that you forgot my gunshot screw you)

[Hook - 4x]
Hell raisers on the rise, paper making guys
Who stop at nothing think we bluffing, look into our eyes

[Lil' Keke]
See it really ain't a thang to me, always grind for the currency
What fifteen on the scene with green, had to get away from that J-O-B
Born and raised to have nothing to gain, year after year but ain't a damn thang changed
Look in the mirror 'fore you judge a man, and I swear to God you gon respect this game
Get shit together 'fore you ride, too many real niggas already died
From East to West who's the best, North to South gon claim they side huh
Everything's everything fa sho, bring your hat to ya when you hit the do'
At the age 24 I'm a CEO, no time to play I gotta run the show
Hell raiser on the rise with no disguise, so iced out I gotta stay in your eyes
Take the rap game with a big surprise, Commission rich nigga we been the wise guy
Everybody wanna just roll with us, jump in the drop try to stroll with us
Get on the block and try to hold with us, but it takes more than that to be cold as us what

[Lil' O]
Well they call me Lil' O better known as hell raiser, 36 cooker and a state trail blazer
FED's on my ass but I never fail playa, breeze still get delivered like mail papers
Crawl slow down the average snail playas, sitting on 20's sitting on haters
2000 Benz like grey exterior, leather and wood all in my interior
Yelling out the window you niggas in inferior, go ahead and try to run up I'll bury ya
And I ain't just bumping and trying to put fear in ya, I got some'ing in this car that'll bury ya
See the Fat Rat don't play around, got killers on my team that'll lay you down
Hit your block lock in a drop top with the Glock cocked, busting out the roof and come spraying you clowns
You shoulda been talking what you saying now, you didn't wanna mind you are paying now
You were sure acting funny bunny with a nigga money, now you funny bunny bitch ass paying now
Yeah they hating now they wanna take my nuts, everytime I pull up I take they sluts
But they ain't taking shit but a bullet to the gut, cause O ain't scared to pull the trigger nigga what

[Clay-Doe]
Hell raisers on the rise, niggas just like flies
To strategize categorize, motherfuckers then they die
They just a bigger pie for my G's to ball, these my dogs so fuck all y'all
I take a steak knife hit your wind pipe, keep dripping till the tip of the blade gets stuck on the wall
Cheap ruger rip high on the raw, triggers coming out without a flaw
Hit the club scene with the mug mean hit the stage, raising hell loco going to war
But that's for the FED's I'm looking for the ends, five bedrooms with the two-thee Benz
Cocked ready for the niggas wanna do me in, fuck me one time bet you won't do it again

[Mike D]
We got Glocks to break down, funds from shake downs
Motherfuckers gon feel the wrath of me, and Po-Yo come for the take down
Move out the way clown I'm starving like Marvin, Harvin and Marvin stepping on toes
Crystal flake cakes by the boat loads, all I cop from the 'lumbos
Swell in the gate state's a no go, figga fo' flows like my nigga Po-Yo
Keep blood money like my nigga Lil' O, Don Keke banging Clay-Doe
Hell raiser Hogg was bout the pesos, send fifty henchman through your front do'
Surrounded by killers possessed with dojo, boys don't move till I say so
Shoulda never fucked with phsyco Michael, I'm the type of hogg that'll play it how it go
Step out on your block with the Glock 4-0, watch a nigga get like his name flow Joe

[Big Pokey]
Slow your roll cause I done hit the do', hot to the Scott cause I hit the dro
Cuff your bitch cause I'll hit the ho, take her place she don't get the do'
Y'all know Yo I'mma keep it realer, make the 6-4 crawl like a caterpillar
Quick to blast a nigga nigga me and Lil' Ke, Miggity D and O pack a milli
Make motherfuckers fold like a armadilla, if I swarm a nigga then I'mma harm a nigga
Nine times out of ten I'mma warm a nigga, or I pull a Saddam and then I bomb a nigga

[Mr. 3-2]
Hell raisers on the rise, paper making guys
Look into my eyes, you see a killer in disguise
I'm sitting wide body, gone off killuminatti
Raising hell for my mail, and doing these niggas is my hobby
No smoke Bobby Brown, only doja and flight
Mr. 3-2, Southside Playa for life
Get it right or get gone, 'fore I do some'ing to ya
With the 4-5 ruger, burning boys like buddha

[C-Note]
The Southside Playaz and Botany Big Shots, Screwed Up Click we got the big knots
Boys looking sick we got them big rocks, 3rd Coast Born all up on my yacht
I'm feeling kinda good when I grip the wood, do it like I should represent my hood
Gotta hold it down like you knew we would, nailing up placks like I knew we could
It's going down when I'm on sight, I grip this AK like I grip the mic
I keep my rhyme tight pulling out the Ike, swinging elbows all through the night
Got cell phones sky pagers, grip codes and we living major
From H-Town all to the Cader, we blowing up like hell raisers

[Hook - 4x]

[Big Moe]

(chorus until end of song fading out behind talkin)[E.S.G.]
Here comes the Wreckshop bomb, that Big H.A.W.K. didn't refuse
Coming down on a song, I couldn't refuse
I'm with the Jam Down Don, Botany Boy boss
Put a fo' in the room, we gon break boys off
Wide body Denali, I'm riding Y2 grey
Tell the FED's I ain't scared, I'm down with the D.E.A
E.S.G. and Big H.A.W.K., got boys under our wings
I'm about to let 'em up, Lamborgini with screens
What you mean you can't dance, to the Screwed Up Click
Make the world boom-boom, tap-tap to it
Through the do-do, man here come the pro-pro
Freestyle King, and I'm so damn throwed though
Wrist fully froze, with the princess cuts
So much ice on my piece, look like a cooled cup
Man hold up, haters in a trance
Southside crunk, pop your trunk and make it dance huh

[Lil' Keke]
It's fa sho, we step in the do' motivated
My click iced out, prepare to be faded
My watch my wrist, my neck so crushing
We hit the dance flo', and bitches start rushing
Get your shake on, what you waiting on what you got
Do that thang, work that thang you're hot
Oh yeah you looking good, but I just might pass
Cause you ain't working hard enough, put some bounce in that ass
You want some cash, wrong nigga wrong time
Girl you way out of line, I'm for real bout mine
Now do that strut, shake that butt what
Since you walked up in the club, you been backing it up
Here we go, she back on the flo' touching her toe
The first to let her know, that I don't love no ho
And the party don't start, right after mic check
All the people gon dance, when Screw wreck the deck what

(*DJ Screw scratching*)

[H.A.W.K.]
I can make you dance, bust the seam if your pants
Make you shake it so hard, you need a ambulance
Put boys in a trance, cause the three point stance
Have you screaming like Biggie, give me one more chance
Biting mics like hands, and Paris Bueller in France
Now I'll blind you with my piece, with the slightest glance
My game is advanced, with my Screwed Up style
Make you back that ass up, like Juvenile
Crushed ice in my smile, live a lavish lifestyle
And my freestyle, makes me so versatile
On my feet crocodile, keep a low profile
And one night with me, I'll make it worth your while
I'm the golden child, call me H-A-W-K
And making money, is my authority
Year Y2K, now my stocks done grew
And we can make you dance, when you jamming Screw

(*DJ Screw scratching*)

[C-Note]
Baby I can make you dance, here's your chance don't miss it
Bezeltines fancy things, pinky rings kiss it
Bentley with automatic stuff, we playa bout
We making hoes get under our wings, like Big H.A.W.K
C-Note on top the charts, Big Shots off the heezy
I'm quick to wreck shop on them bops, like E.S.Geezy
For sheezy, man we making cash forever
My drop got the glass, with the grilling leather
However, we represent for the South
Plenty diamonds on my hand, plenty diamonds in my mouth
We pull up at Mega Meg, platinum over grey
I can make the drop dance, you can make that ass shake
Don't hate, baby girl I'mma keep it real
C-Note without his grill, like a fish with no gill
Just another platinum, from the Screwed Up Click
Me, Big H.A.W.K., and E and Ke' we dropping platinum shit

(*DJ Screw scratching*)[Kay-K]
I'm stuck in this world, I'm worrying about my paper
All the hustlers know the paper rules
Thinking about the (?) for my eyes
And all the players clocking G's, aside(?)
Now it's time for me to slip on the ave, got my big gal
Got my bourbon on slab, the bullet (?)
More fiends and we're clocking the G's(?)
I got five on it, wanna come smoke with me?
(?) for the '95 to the '96
The drop top 400, (?) yeah bitch?
Young in the game, I'm never gonna change
As long as my flows (?), I'mma swang
For my neighborhood, where it's all good
I'm rolling (?) on some wood
A point understood
Gon' go catch a fucking case
It's Kay-K in the industry in your face
First I blow up with my syrup in my cup
I represent the '96 all Screwed Up

[DJ Screw]
So much stress, damn I can't cope
With all the drank and syrup and blowing killa smoke
Staying on my hustle, each and every day
Me and (?) that's the only way
To survive as a young black youth
I done Screwed Up the whole rap industry
Screwed Up Click, coming in '96
And all you jealous player haters, y'all can eat a dick
Cus it don't stop, and you know I'm stayin' down
Representing the south side, for the H-Town
Putting in work all day it ain't no joke
I'm about a drank, Kay go and buy the smoke
Six deep in the bourbon, steady flippin'
Nigga we some players, we ain't set trippin'
Better keeps my nine for them niggas outta line
If it be a murder I ain't scared to do the time
I let the nigga beat it on lock outta state(?)
Man to be a trip, how to be this player hater(?)
But we gon' keep flippin' and you know we high side
Cus the nigga Screw is gonna get me some wine(?)

[H.A.W.K.]
Say Screw done got beat, got his face in the syrup
Saying where's the alcohol? So nah, here's the main course
Now I done grabbed the mic so you know it's time to wreck
Got a (?) five birds (?) to the deck
Got licked up in Asia and Iran
Stopped off in Florida sold the bird to this chick(?)
Sipping on the paint so you know I'm in the lean
Got my last check, so I sold it to a kid/key(?)
Made major moves didn't have no hassle
Now I'm back in my (?) flipping to my castle(?)
That's the way it is, the way I want it to be
Those were my dreams, now here's reality
Born as a hustler since my first day of birth
Struggling in this game trying to get what it's worth
Now that I'm older I done really got wise
Known for my homies and these hoes I despise
Bell Biv Devoe and (?)
How you niggas learn from the bitch (?)
Hoes by the name of (?) with a little money
Pussy was the scent to make him act funny
Turn against your friends make your (?)
Now she's (?) down the boulevard
Now the moral of the story always stay a G
Never get took by a piece of pussy
Now I keep (?) travelling foreign places
And I keep stacking dead presidents' faces
Now I'm a bitch to the bay(?)
It's another lesson from the H.A.W.K

[Lil' KeKe]
Summer rising (?), hair line receding
Car steady speeding, (?)
The corners of the streets, and three of them are shiest
But the last corner is the chapter of my life
The game is a book, I stop and took a look
And then I figured out I had the skills of a crook
My plan and my wages, turning my pages
Changing my ages, levels and stages
Blood steady pumping through my veins and soul
Smoke coming out my mouth and out of my nose
Stress on my chest, burning me like sess
Selling it for less, really ain't the best
So I drift back to the days of the south
I was sipping my ass and a quarter in my mouth
Now I realized that the game is more drastic
Drapers in my car but it could be up in my casket
So pay attention, oh did I mention
The song that we singing is a Screwed Up invention
Rocks up in my wrist, dirt up in my piss(?)
Haters in my face, long against my list
Stacking me a bank, sipping on this drank
Getting up on my knees, because the lord is who I thank
I'm ending this song with a touch of class
When I'm on the mic, I shows my naked ass
Thanks for your support, what you would put forth
Pay me my money, or meet me up in court
Get up off my dick, we left the world sick
This is Lil' Keke representing the Screwed Up Click[Hook: Miss Asiah]
I'm gonna miss you Screw
I'm gonna miss you Screw
I'm gonna miss you Screw
And it's coming from that Big Tyme crew

[Ronnie Spencer]
Hey fellas yeah, I don't know what I'm gonna do
Now I can't live my life, without you Screw
And everytime, I'm flipping down the Avenue
I see that bubble gum Impala, coming through
And I know, it's DJ Screw
Even though you made it, you made it
You always kept it real

[Hook]

[Ronnie Spencer]
It was bad enough, when someone stole my Screw tape
Oh I was devastated
What I'm trying to say, what I'm trying to say
Oh you really will be missed, until I see you again one day
Until I see you Screw
Even though, you made it
You always kept it real, keep it real Screw

[Hook - 3x]

(Ronnie Spencer)
Big Tyme, Big Tyme
Yeah, gonna miss you baby
And everybody, everybody gon' miss you baby
Yeah yeahHow can I come up (sitting)
How can I come up (sitting)
How can I come up
From the inside looking out

Sitting in the Harris County Jail
Spending all my little time

Inside looking out

My driving faster cars
I'm just staying at bars
And about to lose my mind

Inside looking out

So I get up to take a shower
For .. are everywhere

Inside looking out

Saw a trustee eating more than me
And I thought it wasn't fair

Inside looking out

And it hurts right here
Stuck in here for a year

Inside looking out

Sitting in the county
I'm living in an hourglass
Twiddling my fucking thumbs
Waiting on time to pass

Till my next court date
But if you been to the county
You know you're holding your own fate
In your own hands
About to go in front of the judge
Hoping for a chance
To speak out, and just be heard
To put the scene of the crime in your own words
Thinking witness, man, I doubt to my scenario
Maybe now, but I got one shot
So here I go
Right now I can't afford to be locked up
Niggas and the crooks
I keep my dope and that's fucked up
For what I said you know I about to get a gang or time

They found me guilty
And now I'm confined
To an over-crowded cell in the county

For what's my boy said
They billed a hired bounty hunter
To make the most and, you know, stick around
Cause like a beef in the night
I'm damn sure go'n skip town
But who could blame a brother for doing this
..
But for now I'm on the inside looking out

(Sitting in there this kind of jail)
Sane about to lose my mind

Inside looking out

Sitting in the courtroom
I'm staring at the fucking judge
Don't want to plead
Cause I know that I had the drugs
And the justice system is fucked up
Chances of being black and getting off really suck
Cause young black men
Couple of problems
I really
..
My way
Trying to solve them
Because the judge got me
In oppression
Once in a jail cell
Now I learned my lesson

They found me guilty
And sentenced me 20 to life

They found me guilty
And sentenced me 20 to life
I'm reading page by page
Of the Bible every night

Praying to God to forgive me for my sins
Saying to myself that I'll never do it again
Lying to myself
Now ain't that a damn shame
When I get out this bitch
I'll be jumping back in the game
But for now I better do my time
With good behavior
..
Walking through the gate my thoughts shout
Cause I'm on the inside out
Cause I'm on the inside looking out
Feeling bad cause I'm on the inside looking out

(Sitting in there this kind of jail)
Sane about to lose my mind

Inside looking out
..

Back to the mother fuckin stank
Fuck the dumb shit
Cause this time I'm damn sure
Go'n run the tank
Getting swol' .. mother fucker
Thinking about them stank
Ho's coming through this bitch
Dropping niggas by the ankles
And the niggas that's been
Know what I'm talking about
Is my stomach strong enough
To hold this shit
Till I get out
This mother fucker .. me
A chamber full of misfits
Three .. and a cot
Some hard ass bitch gets
The county's a bitch, boy
That's paranoid as a nigga get
Slap the living shit
Out of a nigga for a cigarette
They got me off the street
Although my life was very fucked up
For jacking for cars
Now I'm jacking for commissary
No time to play bully in the county
Ain't no stars, nigga
Trying to squeeze your head
Through the motha fuckin bars
Bitch take the shoes off your feet
Or even worth it trying to hang you
With the motha fuckin bed sheets
Sleep with your eyes open
If you want to see daylight
Cause when I get out this bitch
I'm damn sure go'n go right
Cause coming up on the street
Is what my life was all about
But how can I come up
From the inside looking out?

Stayin down with the herd
Stayin down with the cattle

Young G's I be stressin

We come thru on incarceration

The foes want for 60
I'm might just come back
With Poyo instead of 50
Key-C is gonna shine
That boy Shaun reclined
I hit the Long Drive now it's time I do mine
It's time I just chill and lay back and sip a 8
I'm sittin' sideway
TV on tha scrape plate
They don't hate when they see
We coming, we don't fuss
We don't even cuss
We swanga's on the bus: Damn![Fat Pat]

Hollering at my niggas out there, uh, lookin' dandy

Got the pot, got a lot of cash

And my game, I spit the way when I'm on the lean
In the club, in the bitch ear now she's gonna fiend
Take her to the bed, you know the story
The flaming glory
Don't ever worry
Fat Pat is gonna hurry
And break the boys off
From the fucking north
I'm really from the south
So what they talkin' bout?
You know how I do it

Surround my sound, broke it down

[Fat Pat]
Pourin' drank
Let's call up on drank
Yeah I got mine
It's goin' down
Smooth

...On drank... let's lean... let's lean...[Everybody talking]
Man it's about five in the motherfuckin' morning (Ha, ha, ha)
And a nigga can't sleep (Ha, ha, ha), ya know what I'm sayin'
I'm thristy than a bitch, what's the deal
Shit I'm bout to call up my bitch in the paint
See what she up to, know what I'm sayin'
Pull over and see what's the deal, know what I'm sayin'
Nineteen ninety motherfuckin' nine (Nineteen ninety nine)
Nineteen ninety nine, can't you see, nineteen ninety nine
(The whole Screwed Up Family) third coast, H-Town
Texas ballers (Real G's hook it up)
Got my money on my mind (Cause we down south)

[Hook]
We got our mind on our money, money on our mind
Screwed Up Click for life and ya know we put it down
We got our mind on our money, money on our mind
Finger on our trigga nigga, hand on our nine

[DJ Screw]
I gotta thinkin' that I'm makin money all day
And to my niggas that know, we all ball this way
Never ever set trippin' got love for G's
Pimpin' on my nigga, rise up of these
I broke em' off in 92 schools, shit on the under
96, 97 gotta trunk full of thunder
All screwed up, pausin' music in the streets
And got the Feds kickin' down doors searchin' for the cheese
Down south, black Jeeps slangin' dope ass tapes
Chopin' up records, spittin' game in the brace
Outsiders lookin' in tryin' to see what I'm doin'
I'm inside lookin' out now they plan is ruined
Police takin' pictures of the crib yellin' "Drugs sold"
100,000 sold, what the fuck I need drug fo'
DJ Screw, independent in this game
Sippin' Cogn with my niggas, ain't a damn thang changed

[Hook x2]

[Al-D]
I didn't fall off like ya thought I would
I done hopped of lockdown, ballin' in the hood
G'd up on the set, soakin' wet
Hoes lickin' my sweat, from my ankles to my neck
And I ain't through yet, fixin' to cash my check
Smoke a gank of stanky dank and ride until the sunset
In my Hoo-Doo jammin' nothin' but screw-zoo
Makin' boo-koo, I'm on the ends like I used to
Still true to the game, swervin' lane to lane
Mary Jane got my window pane foggy in the rain
And man what a shame I feel so good
Fresh off lock, a nigga back in the hood
Ballin' outta control pockets roll to get swole up
Screwed Up Click worldwide and takin' over
Southside for life, this is Al-D
Livin' my life as a young black G

[Hook x2]

[Mike-D]
Yeah my cars roll candy and my hoops stay tinted
Southside, 3rd Ward represent like I'm in it
Now these niggas out here comin' and these cuts ain't givin' a damn
Better adapt, as they strapped, why these hoes got me tapped
Get a slub and hit em' in the freckles
Lookin' for Hyde crock a lie with the Jekyll
Chick be a trip so I peep when I flip
They get more and more hip with every bumpin' hit
With the turns, lettin' it burn, dodgin' white folks
Zones to the dome got me guffed in weed smoke
These streets be like freaks ready to fuck, butt naked
Get some of that head when they least expect it
Glock sittin' on my hood's hip and I'mma bail
That shit was hell, had my ace brain under my fingernail
Better smell the dope analyze the lines
Gone off pine stayin' crooked all the times

[Hook x2]

[Clay-Doe]
In this game if ya snooze ya lose
I paid my dues, roads to riches is the path I choose
Stackin' my fetti full focus, with my eyes on the prize
Watchin' for hoes and foes while I'm on the uprise
Fill the heater with extra clips, rollin' so low
Cause ya never know what homo wanna break ya off on the low low
Ridin' for mine cause I trust my bitch, my Glock
For these niggas that shortstop, I bombard they road blocks
And marked for death versus a damn Mafia hit
Got me fucked up from droppin' LP's with the Click
We talk the talk and we walk the walk
Realest niggas from the south straight hoggin' with the galk
We got our mind on our money, money on our mind
My fingers on my trigga and I'm gone off nine

[DJ Screw ad-libs]DJ Screw
A mufucka wonder what I'll do
Kill you bitch, pop-pop a lot
Youth or ancient, whats the deal?
Southside it's a new era, knoimsayin?
Put you on your boy's mind, real shit
Know what I'm talkin about?

[DJ Screw - Verse 1]
Nobody seems to understand that my brain ain't stable
They got me out on a ledge, feel like I'm fallin off the edge
It ain't no fable, it's re-ali-ty
Feel like I'll move an your fizzin
They're tryin to tackle me, thats why I keep up the business
So relative or stranger, better keep yo' distance
I can't determine friend from foe so you in danger
Chemical inbalances of the weed and cocaine
But it really don't matter to society
A nigga that got no face an no name
Deservin more, but I'mma move until I ain't got nothin left
An the only thing thats promised to me is more povert and death
Cuz theres some niggas lookin for me an they might be near
And if they kill me dont shed a tear, Remember I'm a heavy here
Even still, gotta keep my eyes on the prize
Although my vision is blurry I'm losing life in a hurry
Even my girlfriend dont understand
Don't want her to witness the wicked
So please find yourself another man... haters feel me

[Hook: repeat 2X]
This..is..my..liiiife
Forgotten in the struggllle
Livin to shine

[Verse 1 - screwed and chopped]

[DJ Screw - Verse 2]
Opposition and proposition is schemin for cash
And if you bitches is scandilous, I get mad at ya
So I alleviate the pressure, don't try to run
I guarantee the slugs'll catch ya (hahahaha)
Oh yea, I keep some problem solvers
I'll pistol-whip my automatic and revolver, check it
An I'm a, "hello bab-ay", it's in my nature
This a must it ain't a maybe p.k
The feds takin pictures and tappin my phones
But if I catch you bitches snitchin best believe me it's on
I analyze an visualize to open fire on bitches
And if I catch you bastards asleep I'm leavin bodies in ditches (huh?)
I'll bet they ask a bastard: "feel like spendin a long one in a casket?"
Check it
Niggas bustin your ass, all I'll give you's a ski mask
Bustin shots from my Rolles, tryin to make your car crash (feel me)
... This is MY LIFE

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - screwed and chopped]

[DJ Screw - Verse 3]
Everybody think I love keepin impulsive pride tappin
But I know they wouldn't give a fuck about me if there wasn't no money in rappin
See I know they wanna get rich off of me, understand
Even if I was to die I would still rep talk, they'd still put a mic in my hand
Quit tryin to cover my style of life, pretendin like they from my block
But I survive from willin to live while they depend on war and talk
Before you make your move, check yourself and give 'er in front of me
Even if lyrical strugglin, adjust your ticket cuz you know how dead your gonna be
There's gon' be a dentist to see
When a nigga be screamin and hollarin "I'm yo' Godfather"
But I guess it's just the menace in me
Plus, the only nigga that's keepin me from clickin is Herman Fisher
We dont care cuz to kid us he'll get us a drink and infinite burnin swishers
Why they wanna play with my life? they got families, nigga I don't
The only thing between me an them hoes is I'mma keep thuggin they timid ass home
But they mind they own goddamn business, and keep theyself outta mine
Because of a thin line between livin they business and boo-yah!
Caught with the nine baby

[Hook] - 2XSouth Park
Said I'm 'bout to lose my mind

[Scratches]

Every time I wake up, I give the swisha sweet a hit
Sometimes I feel I just can't survive without that lick
Hustlers use my beeper for unnecessary dealings
So when we work we die from killers work be killing
Punk mother-fakers take the pranksta for a joke
So how you gon' play a South Park og full of smoke, fool
I'm a head banger, ex banger, and when you enter
The South Park chamber, you in danger
Beware of him who, walk behind the corn
Cause my brain was designed in my frame before I was ever born
And you was right, when you said I had a head with no screws
But it was tight, when I stopped facing them hip hop blues (boom)
How you gon' say I can't play with the big boys
And all the big boys play with all my Tonka toys
You better flip the script and get with this
And if that buddha don't do ya, then go dippin' (yeah)
Take a walk through this jungle
And you can follow me all the way to Chi, if you want to
But you ain't know me 'til I got bank
So that explains, when you approach me
My mind went blank

[Hook]

It's hard to think, when my mind goes blank
You just can't think when your mind goes blank
[x4]

In this game, hangin' with my crew
Robbing everybody, hell, I might've robbed you
Taking care of mines, keepin' my homeys tight
Sharing what was mines, cause I ain't no jealous type
But still I get hype, and fight back when you back stab
I'll grab you straight by the neck and DDT you to the slab
Now here you go, you got me all physical
Now I'm in court, trying to tell the judge that I'm a lyrical
Freight train, gotta maintain game in this free world
Life is change, niggas stay the same but I'll make your head twirl
You really don't know me, your honor
To make a story short, in the end I'm a goner
You move you lose in the game homey and I'm searching for my come up
Life's a melting pot, don't move Point Blank won't put his gun up
Outsiders try to read me but they don't know me
Point Blank, label my lifestyle "OG"
Cook County, Chicago and Houston
South Park [?] the clan, I'm boostin'
To be frank, let me hit the dank before you take me to the tank
Allah I thank
My mind went blank

[Hook]

I'm gonna briggity, briggity break it on down
To the noise
So best believe I'm a clown
On this hella fire track that [?] hooked up
I came in and dropped the vocals and [?] did a cut
Now we gon' freak it the way it's supposed to be freaked
So when I speak don't be afraid to say that other track weak
Over in the streets I hear fiends like, "Point Blank a trick"
The same mouth it came out, the same mouth that I hit
Oh, did I tell you? How I knock jaws in the dirt
I let him player hate in my face and then I hit em' where it hurts
Yeah you, damn fool spread my business through the hood
And I'm here to let you know that it ain't all good
You came to the hospital to cheer a brotha up
Soon as you left, went through the hood and tried to tear my name up
But I'm finna set it straight, that other day
What really went on, I tried to kill myself fool
So to me wasn't nothing wrong
So next time you wanna be a Howard Cosell
Go run and tell the hood how my brother [?]
Finished up your girl, aight then
On the [?] I'm laughing all the way to the bank
This grudge is forever, forgive never
My mind went blank

[Hook][Sample: Notorious B.I.G]
It's the ones that smoke blunts with ya, see ya picture
Now they wanna grab the guns and come and get ya

[Intro]
Yeah, one time for the homie DJ Screw
Already, I'm feeling throwed in this bitch

[Verse 1]
I'm so high even when I'm coming down
Just met a girl say she from the H-Town
I say my name is Drizzy and ain't nobody realer
Cup inside a cup, smoking Ghostface Killah
Got these boppas going crazy, nigga I'm the man
I sent ya girl a message, said I'll see ya when I can
She sent me one back, but I ain't never read it
Cause pussy's only pussy and I get it when I need it

[Verse 2]
I'm telling you, I'm as cold as windows down in the winter
And I be riding rims if my tires any thinner
Airport stunting, flying charters overseas
Full of Dom Perignon and the water for the D's
Don't know why it happens, everytime we alone
But here we are again and I swear I'm in my zone
So I'm a sip this drank until that mothafucka gone
And you gon' get undressed and we gon' get it on

[Hook]
I don't give you the time, you deserve from me
This is something I know, I know, I know
So tonight I'll just fuck you like we're in Houston
Taking everything slow, so slow, so slow but I do it to her

[Bridge]
Draped up, dripped out, know what I'm talking 'bout
3 in the morning, get it popping in the parking lot
It's on once again and I never pretend
A nigga staying G 'til the end

[Outro]
Ay, yeah, I swear like everytime we find ourself in this situation
You know, I just get that feeling like I'm in Houston
Candy paint switching colors in the light
It's about like 11 p.m. and you just rolling through the city
Bumping that Screw, Big Moe, UGK, Lil' Keke
It feels like everything's just moving slow
Let's take my time, I pace it baby, yeah, I'm gone(*talking*)
Screwzoo, what's the deal baby
Lil' Trae up in here, putting it down
Trying to hold it down, know I'm saying
Everybody out here, still representing to the fullest
You know I'mma hold it down fa sho
Ain't no mo' being sad, we gon put it in they face
Again and again, just like you say know I'm saying
We gon smile fa sho

[Trae]
Sitting low behind tints, swanging to Southwest
I got a tech to the chest, penetrating the plex
And if a nigga don't know, we Down South thugs
In the Dirty Third, that's going off like slugs
Beating the boulevard, and swanging in throwed cars
And talking on cellulars, three plus two broads
With a bad broad, shotgun up in the frame
You know Guerilla Maab thugs, be down to pull stunts
On the first of the month, popped up like trunks
And when a nigga showing off, we pump up punks
Fin to dump, showing a nigga Lil' Trae don't play
Blue over grey with a K, fin to make your day
Breaking the mic, since my reputwa
Like niggas at Cornbread's, sipping the bar
Like Roy Jones, when he be breaking a jaw
Like two dykes, in a menage tois
Lyrically, I can't be stopped
Niggas can't see me, even if I was 3-D
I told you once, and I'mma say it out again
S-L-A-B, be raw pimping a pen
In the wind for the divid-ends, and a big body Benz
With the bubble lens, moving it down I-10
Taking a spin, a Cardier with the blue lens
On my grind, steady stacking all of my ends
I'm moving slow, turning everybody head
So you know I'm thoed, I'm fin to pop my do's
On glass 4's fin to pop my trunk, with a lot of glow
I got a lot of flow, and a lot of thugs
From the Southeast side to the block, I put
All of my ghetto motherfuckers, steady showing love
Throwing a deuce in the air, when they feeling us
I know you feeling us

[Hook - 2x]
On the Southside
Candy sprayed, looking so live
84's and vogues, we glide
Screwzoo, you know we holding it down

[Trae]
Niggas ain't ready, for what we do
When I'm in my drop, or in the hoodo
Pull up on the block, with grey on the blue
With four 18's, and banging Screw
I don't give a damn, if y'all hate me
When it come to rap, y'all can't fade me
A lot of y'all niggas, know who we be
I'mma tell you once, you better let me be
In the zone, cause I'm thoed off
Niggas wanna think, that I fell off
But I gotta stay four steps, ahead of y'all
So when I feel plex, I'mma haul em off
3-65, I gotta watch my back
Every song that I'm on, I bring hats
Gotta hell of a stop, making niggas squash the chat
I done proved my points, so you better back back
From Guerilla Maab 3D-2
Paid my dues, I'm in a store near you
Staying true, when I'm thinking about Screw
Everyday, I'mma always loving you
Mayn, I know it just don't stop
84's and tipping slow, on chops
Lose the cops, I got a trunk on knock
Please believe, Trae headed to the top

[Hook - 2x]

[Trae]
Living down in H-Town, I gotta do my thang
I'm on the grind full time, holding down my name
S.U.C. affiliated, niggas hate it
And I'm still on point, when I'm gripping the grain
I put it all in your face, when I stay on the paper chase
And niggas wanna plex, cause I'm ahead of the race
Better hold that down, cause I'm a real nigga
Educated in the streets, so I'm clicked up with killas
Dougo, Rocko, Jay'Ton and By-Bo
In the air like hydro, they know
We so toed, kicking down the do'
And like the Z-Ro say, I'm thinking you better let it go
Pulling up in the wide body fo' do', with the missing top
So the hoes'll bop, roll stop and drop, you know I cock the Glock
And for the P-A-T, you know we still body rock
In the Coupe or foreign car, slabbed out
Screens on glow, coming out the stash spot
Soldiers that's united for the cash, a lot
And for the love of Screw you, I'm riding on knot
That's everyday, and I'm loving it mayn
Ain't shit changed, I gotta go get it
Come back with it, and I won't quit
Sideways on a switch, representing for the click bitch

[Hook - 2x](Pocket Full of Stones - by UGK is in the background mix)
"I got a pocket fulla stones"

[Lil Keke]
I'm draped up and dripped out
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Three in the mornin', gettin' the gat out the stash spot
Fire up a fat sweet
Turnin' on the bulb lights
Hand on the wood grain
Ass on the tight white
Showin' naked ass in the great state of Texas
Home of the players, so there'll never be no plexin'
So long we've been waitin'
Never ever hatin'
In Houston we Elbows, In Cali they Daytons
So 1996 you hoes better duck
Because the world gon' drip candy and be all Screwed Up
Just pop in your grey cassette
Turn up your fuckin' deck
Lend me your ear because the Southside finna wreck
Down here we smoke tree
Then let the world see
True hidden talent like Screw, and Lil Keke
Ain't no love for hatas and you busted big suckas
On the south side we stayin' paid MuthaFucka!

(Pocket Full of Stones - by UGK is in the background mix)
"I got a pocket fulla stones"
"...And they won't leave my ass alone"

[DJ Screw]
Lil Keke gone and tell 'em what time it is...

[Lil Keke]
It's time to lay 'em down like a fresh set of dominoes
For all the playas, all the pimps, all the bitches, and all the hoes
Who's the man, who's the boss
Who's the nigga that's payed the cost
I really don't give a damn cause I ain't the one that's gonna take the loss
Grippin' a grand up in the slab, workin' the wood it's understood
Flippin these Rolls, and slammin' these doors
Pullin' these hoes and wearin' these clothes
Who in the the hell was able to tell the southside they had to chill
From hittin' tha boulevards from belts and buckles, woman and grill
I'm poppin' the trunk and smokin' a skunk and pullin' up candy red
Sittin' on bucks, not givin' a fuck and able to turn a head
Somethin' serious when I let go cause I got a way with words
I'm able to clown when using a noun to take the place of verbs
My lyrics go together like a pair of socks and shoes
My flow is slow because it's bolted down by DJ Screw
Take it from me, the nigga Lakee, the H, the A, the R and D
Menace to society
Born and raised to be a G
I grabs the 'phone go on and on
2 or 3 songs I won't postpone
Cause these lyrics comin' from the very top of my dome
So many ways it pays, If you can flip the script
By movin ya tongue, you take a dose and listen close, promise that you'll be sprung
Jacker's and hustler's, player's and mack's
Foreign doors and Cadillacs
Serve codeine that makes you lean and killer sweets rolled out the stacks
All these thangs remain tha same because I'm so able to win
All around just bow down
Because Lil Keke pimps tha pen
