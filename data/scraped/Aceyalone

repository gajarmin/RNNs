[Intro: Mystic]
It was so beautiful
Remember how in love we were?
So in love
So in love
Once
So in love
Once

[Verse 1: Aceyalone]
She was a young girl
I was a young man
And I knew they would get her when I let go her hand
And then I let go
The inevitable
So beautiful
And susceptible
So wonderful
And so innocent
And after this neither one of us would benefit
Yeah, I was a dropout
She was a graduate
She said I’ll never be nothing she wasn’t having it
Yeah, I tried to break her down
I tried to reason it
She said I wasn’t nobody to be believing in
Yeah, what a waste of time
What a waste of mind
Your place of mind was a part of the design
Yeah, I used to call her up
She never called back
When she called that said I wasn’t all that
Yeah, I know that times change
And people change, too
I was a fool just to think that I could change you

[Hook: Mystic]
Everyone’s got stories gone
About a love we once knew
So high in the beginning
Until the world cuts through
And then everything changes
Nothing feels the same
Piece by piece it falls apart until
All that’s left is blame

[Verse 2: Aceyalone]
And if I had a chance to do it all over I’d do it exactly the same
I was a b-boy
She was a good girl
Turned hot girl
Had to be a hood girl
Never did she notice she would end up in a shook world
I was like look girl it’s all in the book
Yeah, I used to tell her jokes
I used to make her laugh
And if I had a whole dollar I would give her half
So delicate
And so intelligent
And then she trying to play me out just for the hell of it
Back when she was 19 not even 21
Used to do a thing getting somebody anyone
Thought that she was naive
Or was it really me
I do believe
She was the one that wasn't feeling me
So we broke up at a barbecue
Drove home thinking never will I bother you
Yeah, I just didn’t know
What it was hidden for
She had me sitting low
But she was bullshitting, though

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Aceyalone]
So I just kept rhyming
I caught her eye again
Next thing you know she was hollering let’s try again
But I wasn’t buying in
Didn’t want to lie again
Love was in the frying pan
Baby, it’s done
But she started hanging out
And started being seen
Seeing things different
Said she wasn’t being mean
Yeah, if I let her in
Then I let her win
But I’m a veteran what’s better than a friend
Maybe she was an angel
But she’s in disguise
And I just didn’t see the God-light in her eyes
Or maybe I should I walk away
And cut all the ties
Stay on the rise
Leave love left where love dies
We were youngsters
But we’re older now
But the world is a little more colder now
And I’m just trying to get it all off my shoulder now
Baby, you can hold it down
I’ll see you in the wind

[Hook]

[Outro: Aceyalone]
That’s right, baby
Next life time
Yeah, ain’t that what they say?
Check it out
Love don’t hate
I got love for you
AlwaysLet's begin
Asalaam alaikum, people of good will
I offer you the greeting of thought manifested skill
To finally reveal the open-end chapter
As real as the flesh that you're embodied in
To the skull cavity your mind is rotting in, I'll be riding in
And there might have been a slight, rotation warp to curve
The course of course I'm cordial when I'm reportin
I won't distort, I don't contort
Connect conduct collect console or conceal
In full control of the roll of the wheel
My eyes are my appliance to decipher the science
Omitting defiance with the high-tech mic check
The buttons that flashed I pushed for absolute
Destruction your structure is lifted from the ground
The foundation mound is broke, so you float around
I'm embedded in what is known as beat
Let it be shown, every enzyme is complete
In time, you'll see the pace of the pulse pump
Rapidly, heart rate, happily marched
I happen to be the dark man who holds the charts
I arch my horizontal line to make a rainbow
.. but it ain't the same though, yo
The tried and true pros are chasing fool's gold
Sliding through holes, like small rodents
It's obviously, evident my embellishment
Peaks at two-ninety-two I.Q
Cause Big Ace is the spinner, in the, center
Inventor, and I plan to be a winner meaning
I'll be in the inner outer ovaries, overload, overboard
Overseas hearin oversees more, than the eye can
I stand, limited primitive, sentimentalist, escapist
The way I shape this landscape, automatically makes this, vivid
I give it a rivet, hold it, stand at the pivot
I love it, learn to live it, then give you my exhibit
Not inhibited, not even a little bit, when I'm inclined
My attempts to redefine your hip-hop guidelines
And you can play the sidelines, write rhymes in your spare time
My attempts to redefine your hip-hop guideline
You can play the sideline, write rhymes in your spare time
Cause I'd rather stimulate your mind than emulate your purpose
And we have only touched on the surface of the serpent
Consider me part of the dust, in the dusk
I must collect the samples from the rust
Penetrate the crust then trust no living
Driven by the sonic, language passion
Your ashes spark the flashes, of the neon
From be-yond, what kind of planet could I be on?
I don't know, but I'mma be on, for eons, and eons
While many think that they can never play out
Get trapped in a timeframe, and never find their way out
I stay off the dramatization, and I balance, always seeking the challenge
To show the world the incredible talents
I cut the corners, smooth out the surfaces
Worthlessness is just, half of the problem
I read the grid kid, I did every column
I note the animal kingdom, and the phylum
Wild style 'em! Until they get to hit the target
I mark it on the bulls-eye, of flies, and the buffalo wing in the sky
My architechnique sparks the dark streets, of your resting ground
I suggest that, you warn your town
I inhabit the oxygen, mark off the memory
You will never forget to remember the lone wolverine
Marine biologist machine, with the verbal, internal mind fertile, Foot, over hurdle tight, like girdle,
And my word'll be the last, I incubate, every other millennium
I fast and I hibernate, to pass any of 'em
I am potent, untraceable
No color, no odor, no taste, no replaceable parts
No heart, no head, just a carcass
The darkest days come, right before the light
I watch my watch and stand right before the mic
By the powers, vested in me, I digested MC's
Food for thought, caught on to the end of the rope and swung
Then stood stiff, as if, I was on a cliff
Not beneath sticks, my feet are made of bricks
When I walk my footprints indent cement
I am not practical, nor am I unusual
Nor am I oblivious to, hideous crimes
Every city is captured and trapped in my mind
Given the spinal tap, as the final rap climbs
My attempts to redefine your hip-hop guidelines
You can play the sidelines, write rhymes in your spare time
My attempts to redefine your hip-hop guidelines
You can play the sidelines, write rhymes in your spare time
Cause I have become the night owl on the prowl
Master of the free penpal style
Cause I'm, om-nipotent
I'm, some, government experiment that is out of control
I'm from some big black hole
I square up, select, and rec'd, every tangle
I flare up, and you can try-any-angle (triangle)
Even Bermuda, but I bury the barracuda
Then I'm, octa-gone in the wind with the pollen[Aceyalone]
Aiyyo the police short Cornbread in the street
And they just killed Cochise over a beat

Ah man, I'm just a brother whose intentions are good
Oh lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
I gotta 10 fifty-fo' under the hood
Several stages of lifespan, damned if I would
Be a dope when it's not a laughin matter
Modern contemporary man still hunt and gather data
They want glamour, the priceless prize
Give 'em a torch and they put the fire to your eyes
Give 'em a inch they take a yard and they pull your card
Throw a wrench so far in yours it'll leave a scar
Raise the bar, I pass it with the right scholastics
They made it plastic, that's why they couldn't grasp it
I always knew that you would fail me
Once shame on me twice you shouldn't have to tell me
And I'll be damned if I'll let you get away with that
I just ain't playin that, that's that bullshit!

Jardine and the kids tryin to make ends me
Half dead and do dirty as some God damn thiefs

Yo - hold your head up, you only got your life left
Make the right step and don't sing the wrong song
Fight somebody your own damn size
You dead wrong, thinkin you won't meet yo' demise
This baby here, gon' grow up to be a king
I don't know how you seein things, but that's a fact
It'll be over my dead body
If I let you put a mother{fuckin} monkey on his back
Shit ain't changed, it's just the choices
The voices in your head sayin do what you don't gotta do
They scared of themselves which means that they scared of me
And them the same, punk-ass fools that shot at you
The lord giveth and he taketh away
God bless that I can live to see another day
And if I had it my way I'd hang you all by the neck
Have some respect, I'll serve and protect

Aiyyo the police short Cornbread in the street
And they just killed Cochise over a beat

And if my teachers could see you now
They'll take your head, cause you probably wouldn't even bow
You ain't humble, you mumble jumble
Your tower of so-called power'll crumble
You killed my uncle, put a dagger through my brother's heart
I need another start, cause if I knew then
What I know now, it'll be wild
Booyaka! Booyaka! I'll put you in the ground
A peaceful man ain't got no place here
I guess you wanna see 'em all die with the lambs
I face fear everyday 'til the space is clear
Then I fight 'em like a man cause it's what I am
Somebody told me the road to freedom is lonely
But I swear I ain't goin on my own
I'm takin my sisters, my families, my homies
Now I'm about to take this mother(fucker) home

Aiyyo the police short Cornbread in the street
And they just killed Cochise over a beat
Jardine and the kids tryin to make ends me
Half dead and do dirty as some God damn thiefsUhh, yeah - today is Easter..
So what? Uhh, yeah

When I rock the beat it sounds so incredible
When I put it down it's so unforgettable
Shootin this gift is just so enjoyable
Truth of the matter is so unavoidable
Right over the track you can hear my flow
But watch, for the train, cause it doesn't move slow
I like to gain mo', mental men blow
I know by the symptoms, the system is malfunctioned
But, how can you function without any plan
To put it in your own hands - but I doubt it
See we was all put here, so you could put a foot here on my neck
You better bring a TEC/TECH-
-nician cause permission was respect when I kick
For the mic check, and the almighty intellect
So let's take time to reflect, they haven't got me yet
Place your bets, rapps on deck

When I rock the beat it sounds so incredible
When I put it down it's so unforgettable
Shootin this gift is just so enjoyable
Truth of the matter is so unavoidable
Motherfuckers walk with they NOSE UP
And they all-seeing third eye CLOSED UP
And the green-eyed monster waitin IN THE CUT
Just to FUCK 'EM UP, I know the streets gon' SUCK 'EM UP
Turn on your television, check out the media
And let it captivate you, follow the needier
There's no experience, in your interview
30 words a minute, we won't be needin you!
So let your hustle guide, and don't you be afraid
And if you come up sho't, that's how the game was played
First it's Dr. Jekyll, and then it's Mr. Hyde
It was a groovy ride, now kiss yo' ass goodbye
And you can make it through, and you can make away
I'll keep on mockin you, until the break of day
Yeah, uhh - uhh yeah, rapps on deck

When I rock the beat it sounds so incredible
When I put it down it's so unforgettable
Truth of the matter is so unavoidable
Shootin this gift is just so enjoyable

Uhh yeah, rapps on deck - rapps on deck
... Happy Easter
Alright cut it[Aceyalone]
You can lock your door from the thief, never the liar
I got a firm belief, fight fire with fire
When there's one too many chiefs, all the indians conspire
And somebody gotta go so I can take it higher
Cause I'm a live wire, underneath the radar
State of the art parts, Darth Black Vader
Quicker than a shotgun blast on the trader
Baddest motherfucker both sides the equator
Ready and available, heavily equipped
Steadily my boat rock, but it never flip
I'm heavy hand on the plan tryin to get a grip
Permanent underdog, it's all in the script
My bars went way up, ego went through the roof
I swallowed the truth right along with my pride
I died and came back again, buildin up my stack again
When the world tries to back you in, then you've gots to ride
Lone vigilante, bounty hunter nomad
Boba Fett, no regrets, everything load-ed
My mind is the only thing heavy when I tote it
The one to go down with the last bridge and you know that
Head barely on straight, my heart's in the right place
Still workin on my masterpiece, plannin for the great escape
Get a load of me, look at how I'm takin shape
And I'm so far ahead of the game, make no mistake
Last of the Mohicans, a reverand deacon
Minister Maximillion speakin, heat seakin
I'd rather leave your mind open than to leave it leakin
Aceyalone-wolf, forever and a weekend
The Goddess said she loved me, angels said they had my back
How the hell could I lose, I accept my fate and that was that
Jumped off a moving train to do my thang on the track
Stopped in the heat of the moment, for the impactEasily
So easily
So easily
Easily

I think that it's only right I'll let y'all know from the gate
I flow with the great rappers of 100 million years ago, yeah
Non-identical and non-contendable and still
I tell everybody: just do as you will
Cause the skills to pay the bills'll be the only thing that still wheel
Yeah, I know some people are akward, different, dope, what?
Special in they own way, artistically advanced
Resulting in a lifestyle enhanced by chance
Now that these records are made
Tell me what it's like for you when you hear the record played?
Hm - dynamic, like one gigantic planet
Slightly slanted eyes
To see through your disguise
What a wonderful makeover, excellent takeover
Yo, bring the cake over
I wanna eat it too
And bring the pies over, I wanna bring em too
Yo, bring it all, I want a... look

I'm alive as I can be
Hip-hoppin body-rockin MC degree
And I'm the son of G-o-d
I shine, it just ain't yo time to see

I'm the crowd-hyper, rapid fire-sniper
Viper, so many rappers in diapers
Candy-stripers, we paid the piper
That's why we're listenin
Windshield wipers and air conditioning
And bucket seats while we bumpin beats
I never wanna meet the agony of defeat
I got a simple plan for a complicated issue
I'm a simple man with a complicated issue
And my potential, your potential, our potential
We can sho' nuff make a change and that's essential
Cause the bad boy murderer is on the path
And the bad girl Dragon Lady, she knows witch craft
She makes me laugh, at the same time she breaks my heart
She grabs a hold and she takes it apart
But I can see in the dark, I pee in the park
Bein a part of the art blazin from the spark

Cause I'm alive as I can be
Hip-hoppin body-rockin MC degree
And I'm the son of G-o-d
I shine, but maybe just too bright time to see

I'm a pure bred with the paper and the pencil lead
I hit the nail on the head - off the head
Got a cold way of flowin, a old way of knowin
I'm a Boeing 747 in the wind blowin
I hang at the Chop Shop, gettin smarter
Got the futuristic Bop Hop, I'm ice water
I'm the grandson of Coltrane, the nephew of Miles
Charlie Parker told me: we left you the styles
My style is gorgeous, I flaunt it to pay the mortgage
I forge this past your Average Joes and Georges
Huh, they cut the mic on, I'm like a cyclone
Got to get my hike on and my half-pike on
Look, I'm out your rank, I'm out your class
Freestyle up the coastline a whole tank of gas
I hit the dank and pass, I spank that ass
You flow but I know for a fact you can't last
Your rhymes is weak, metaphores is dumb
Punchlines like you shootin rubber bullets at the sun
Some rappers carry straps and ten-gallon hats
But I carry a guillotine and carry em back
I carry out the plan with a detailed map
I carry a conversation and I carry these raps
I don't bury the hatch, I'm very detached
I marry this batch, yo, she knows where to scratch
I take long walks all the way to the bong shop
Rappin to myself havin long talks, let the song drop
I got the King Kong Hop, the Godzilla Rock
Keep it inside of a strong box cause the killer watts

Cause I'm alive as I can be
Hip-hoppin body-rockin MC degree
And I'm the son of G-o-d
I shine, it just ain't yo time to see

Easily
We rock the mic so easily
I rock the mic so easily
Rip up the house so easily
Tear down the house so easily
We do this so easily
We make it sound like easily[Hook]
When you see somebody stumbling when they walk by
Tell 'em "hey kid, walk straight, master your high" -] Slick Rick
Droolin from the mouth with them bloodshot eyes
Tell 'em "hey kid, walk straight, master your high"
You took a half of shrooms and now you bout to cry?
"Hey kid, walk straight, master your high"
Can't remember a thing no matter how hard you try
"Hey kid, walk straight, master your high"

First you start mumbling
Then you start stumbling
Then your motor skills start malfunctioning
Could it be the intake
Of the chemical that makes your body shake
All over, so critical
First one running to the bar
To get a drink
First one hanging out the car
Chunky pink
Really paralyzed, numb up and sedated
Moving with that rubber band body when you faded
Smoke about an ounce of weed
Drank ten beers, it's just a
Matter of time before you start getting the fears
You can't steer? (you can't steer?)
You can't hear? (you can't hear?)
You ain't here, you can't steer clear?
You wanna go home?

[Hook]
When you see somebody stumbling when they walk by
Tell 'em "hey kid, walk straight, master your high" (-]Slick Rick, 'Hey
Young World' (I think))
Droolin from the mouth with them bloodshot eyes
Tell 'em "hey kid, walk straight, master your high"
You took a half of shrooms, you think you gon die?
"Hey kid, walk straight, master your high"
Can't remember a thing no matter how hard you try
"Master your high"

First you smoke indo
Then some chocolate
But the gin and juice got you skyrocketing
Yo, can I get a Long Island?
Who got the bud?
Now you wanna lay it down
In the club
You supposed to be a thug drinking thug passion
But you can barely push it to the house
Without crashing
Now, you know better
Than getting that saucy
Trying to mix tequila
With kamekaze and bossy (?)
Fudge brownies
With ganja butter
Then you wanna hit the bone?
Your eyes flutter
Yo, she had a happy face
On her ecstacy
She started touching her private place
While she standing next to me
You shoulda had one drink
Like your girl
Now you in the bathroom
Calling Earl
Oh, now you got the spins
The head-twirls
Underestimate your high
It rocked your world

[Hook]
When you see somebody stumbling when they walk by
Tell 'em "hey kid, walk straight, master your high" (-]Slick Rick, 'Hey
Young World' (I think))
Droolin from the mouth with them bloodshot eyes
Tell 'em "hey kid, walk straight, master your high"
You took a half of shrooms and now you bout to cry?
"Hey kid, walk straight, master your high"
Can't remember a thing on the acid fry
"Master your high"

First you need oxygen
For circulation
Then you need agua
Rejuvination
Maybe you should eat something
But nothing spicy
Maybe try a cold thai
Nice and icy
Now you can't leave here
You can barely open doors
Maybe take a shower
Open your pores
Just try to shake it off
Have some activity
Get your shit together
Then come back to the festivities
I'm not saying don't get high
Cuz that's on you
I'm just saying if you don't get high
Then what to do?
See, my friend right here
Can hold his liquor
But my friend right here
Is getting sicker
So, he started beef with my homie over what?
Took this fool to the house
To sober up
Maybe you should listen up
Heed the warning
Or you gonna wake up sick as fuck
In the morning

God DAMN!A beautiful mind, turned water into wine
But that’s not all
Broke the water, shined through
Shaped the earth, created the colder life
Radiated with energy, the great boat of life
The spark
Sparkling through the dark night
Then walked
And took forever without a thing in sight
Didn't hear a sound till the first trickle(?) fell
Depths of the ocean swelled, washed up a miracle
A beautiful yours, a beautiful mines

By the grace of fire, out sprouts the land
Fed the desire, footprints in the sand
Top of the mountain peak, man speaks to himself
Closer to the mother star
What he felt can’t be described
It’s alive
Rise with the tide
Communicate with all sides, nothing wants to die
Buildin’ this, build a bridge
Build a tower
Construct a dam, dig a hole
Build a flower
Ultraviolet rays magnified the essence
All praise to the presence, one pure thought
Taught in the lessons
This spread with the first migration of the heads
And the first ones to flock

A beautiful yours, a beautiful mine
Once so enlightened; once so divine
The planet’s hour line, all void of time
A beautiful mind

They opened up the brain and opened up the heart
What is man made of?
Love from the dark
The will to invent the wheel
Work the field, the shield, the intent to kill, the uphill
Battle of existence, matter of persistence
Matter of distance to search for the mystics
Finder of lost souls, teacher of apostles, the mind’s so colossal
A beautiful mind

A beautiful mind, a beautiful idea
One that was right here, blind to the naked eye, tied to a fear
Once it was nothing and now it is here
A beautiful mind

Not accidental, coincidental, experimental
A beautiful mental, a touch so gentle
A life so simple to spin on the axis to access the temple
A beautiful mine, a beautiful yours
A beautiful mind

A beautiful mind, put fruit on the vine
At the same time he made love a crime
Mellowed out the screams of all mankind
Walked along side of you when you was left behind
Purified the waters, carved the canyons
Fed the families when it was starved and famined
Drew the blueprints so everyone had a chance
Organized the people and made man advance
A beautiful yours, a beautiful mine

Something outtaa nothing
Oh, what a far cry
More than a hard tribe
Pointed out the star guide
Made love, made hate
Saved sake
Nothing left to create but fate
Constructed structures, engineered labyrinths
Detailed a portrait
Healed nations
Took blame when no one else was happening
Evolved the species, and had patience
Wrote the scroll in thousands of languages
Came with us to fight against a giant ??
Created chaos, prevented destruction
Made law and order and then corruption
Laid the foundation for all things to stand on
Then cleared the ground for the mother ship to land on

Sailed across the seas, followed the breeze
Cured disease
Made poison
Settled the fear, took them on the righteous path
Gave them the math, and still had the time to laugh

What a beautiful mind to haveEverytime I flow I get this vision and I know
Everytime I know, I manifest it then I go then
Everywhere I go I plant a seed I hope it grows
But every seed planted ain't always granted life though
Some grow slow and then they flourish in the end
Then again some grow fast and they die out as soon as it begin
Now many moons ago my seed planted into minds that feed
Yes indeed, I cut out fleet
I'm sweatin' tears until I'm freed
My sector the 213, my protector the E-Y-E
Just soak it in like mother earth this earth
Who was once this jewel
Is just a cesspool for fools truly well
There's another chapter to that neverending captured rapture
I tap your mental and stroke the mind so gentle
I'm the sunshine not starred, now I'm irregular and bizarre
But I know exactly who I are, yeah
And I love keepin true and avant-garde
Nobody likes to be a waterboy forever
Never seeing the field thinkin you got it together
Playing foosball in the street
It's yo' game but it's they concrete
And it's my ball, it's my treat
It's my world, it's my head
I live in a hellhole in the wall
And i'll never see the light of day
Subliminals controllin all of y'all but they won't take mines away
What is that instinct to react before you think
And'll make that thought complete
Tell it to the weak, smell before you eat
See I never try to mislead and I walk this planet keyed
Yes indeed, I cut out fleet
I'm sweatin' tears until I'm freed
My sect of the 213 but protect to the E-Y-E
Just soak it in despite all this anguish
It's a book of human language

A book of human language
(A book of language)
It's a book of human language
(A book, a book for reading and reading is fundamental)
It's a book of human language
(And reading is for the mental, for the nondimensional)
(Unintentional yet unconventional here to the)
Just a book of human language
(And books are for reading and this is a book of human language)
(A book of human language)

The lion will never ever lie down with the lamb
That's how I was taught when I sought out to tell them who I am
I exam, I live for the bank and swam, changed my program
But they hold me back like water in a dam, but I won't be held
Even though on a trail with bread crumbs
I'll take it to the max headroom
You'll need more than excedrin
Codeine, morphine, nicotine, caffeine
In yo canteen in your blood stream
I'm a well oiled machine, keep my area quarantined
From the gardens of Florentine to the shores of Tripoli
Scientifically ain't no river me, I'm terrifically well spoken
See many attempts to get a glimpse to see what the hell I'm smokin'
But it ain't no 'bama, I just mastered this bastard grammar
I go outside my parameter and stretch out my diameter
It gets bigger than gamera
So picture that with your camera
Gots steez-amina and steezyle
My steezory as a child ain't much more harsh than yours
I just express mines a little different cause
Life ain't fair but who really cares
I know some people thats over here but they wanna be over there
I know some real cool cats yeah, but they wanna be bears
And when I see 'em chasing chickens, I get heated like a flare
On your face looks scared, your spacesuits got a tear
Yo' a square and I'm beyond compare and I'm rare
Yeah and I'm sick of turning apples into pears
Soon as I get a little bit of it, I'mma share
See I never try to mislead and I walk this planet keyed
Yes indeed, I cut out fleet
I'm sweatin tears until I'm freed
My sect of the 213 but protect to the E-Y-E
Just soak it in despite all this anguish
For a book of human language

{*Aceyalone interacts with the crowd then freestyles*}

Now there's only so many of us who were chosen to shine... could be us all
But if you knows how to climb, you'll be there before they mount up
Now count up all your memories, divide that by your fantasies
Cause ya wanna live life so glamourously, glittery and all shimmery
See everydays a jamboree but with good times comes misery
And misery enjoys company so I hope you got your sensory
Now it really don't make no sense to me, the increasing intensity
And that test is out show density
And I know you don't want to be tested right
You don't wanna be tested right
Well there ain't gone be no mutiny
When they look down me on scrutiny
See reality ain't new to me
And being dumb ain't cute to me
Yo I got somethin' I found out I could get y'all all involved
Just watch the bouncin' ball but see it don't bounce, it revolves see
Now I don't think that I'm unreasonable
Just because I don't really have to have no need a reason to flow
Every season I go squeezin' they hands
And I lead 'em along see
I leave dem a long line of slack and then pulls it right back
See if I give 'em too much, they might mistake my kindness for weakness
If I don't give 'em enough, they might think I don't possess uniqueness
But on the contrary, I got the bombest berries in the fruit tree
With the nutrients to cleanse and rinse your bodies of all the toxins
I locks in, I use my viewfinder, I'mma give you a reminder
I'm on a straight and narrow with no blinders, no blinders
And I still see the rhymes designers that bite like sidewinders
With ten toes down, I spin flows round and round at an angle with anger
The angular warlock like strangler
Sociopathic, graphic, psycho symptom drastic plastic coded, bloated
Just like fatty tissue acid, I'm jurassic
I unmask it with a breadbasket full of molded yeast
Because the stenches'll clinch ya once my gases are released
So just inhale cause you know you know you inhale
As it is in heaven, this is to all the sistren and the brethren
And it goes.... thank youHere we go:
Five, ten, fifteen, twenty
Twenty-five, thirty, thrirty-five, forty
Forty-five, fifty, fifty-five, sixty
Sixty-five, seventy, seventy-five ways

Today's in a maze
And start the craze
When they opened my cocoon
It was time to bloom

Thinkin' like ten people, trapped in one room
Sittin' in my sandbox, sand all over me
Overly anxious to get the mic in my hand
Now who wanna blow it up (I do)
Now who can rip it up (I can)

I glide like the ride of a man on a snowboard
When they pick up the microphone I ask him what he flow for
Various degrees of technique that's inside of me
Never try to be something you not- and don't lie to me
Ebony and Ivory
Keys on my piano playin'
Tryin' to test some music, but the rhythm push my your hand away
Easy as the alphabet
Hard as solid rock
Pure as the driven snow
Pissin' on your block
Mark my territory then I'm right back in it when
Laughin' w/ the teras of a clown when I grin

I'm manic-depresive ever since I was an adolescent
But I never panic in a sesion when I'm bussin'
Cussin' like a sailor
With a bottle full of Jagermeister
Ready for whatever this world has to offer me

Plus it won't get off of me
And never ever test me
I'm one w/ the universe
The energy has blessed me
Bet you wonder why you got flaws in your character
Cause you're caught in the ass-crack of America

I just want to help you all but
All I do is stare at ya
You can have a shot of this
Or maybe hit this marija
Wanna if you wanna but
If not, stay drug-free
But, plug me in the mix boy
Right up next to plug three

Talkin' out the side of your neck it ain't a remedy
I just want the whole wide world to remember me
I don't want to have to think you're working for the enemy
Sbotage. You can't conquer this energy

You can be the center of attention if you want to
My party is in the other room and
We're just having fun too
(So I'd like to signify the monkey that's in back of you)
All I want to do is get rid of all the wack in you

Do not get offended because no I'm not attacking you
I don't have to do nothin', the rapper's start smackin' you
Maybe I should just give you a taste of reality
Welcome to my art show
Its not about a salary

Take two of these a day and burn a couple calories
Me and the mic are like Mickey and Mallory
Rockin' like a B-boy
Part of my anatomy
Hands on your groin'
You can join this acadamy

Accepted... Eclectic

(Repeat)

Respect it

(Repeat)

Here we go:
Five, ten, fifteen, twenty
Twenty-five, thirty, thrirty-five, forty
Forty-five, fifty, fifty-five, sixty
Sixty-five, seventy, seventy-five ways

Today's in a maze
And start the craze
Accepted Eclectic the phrase that pays
Old Eddy Hayes it's time to blaze
One of L.A.'s that's born and raised

Now that we've got ourselves a little more acquainted
Ain't it about time I get this picture painted
I am what you call a psycho-analytical
Critical thinker of the formulas we all need

I think I'm running out of brain space in my hard-drive
Plus I need a memory-card for my control pack
Throw that hand up so I can see your finger-tips
I'm about to rip it up better than before

Yeah I had a crazy-people party and invited you
I didn't know my underground hip hop excited you
Now that I know this fact I'm gonna throw it right at you
I just want to give you everything you're entitled to
Down in the Leimert park, hangin' w/ the hooligans
Every now and then I've got to take'em back to school again
Maybe you should call me your hip hop counselor
I'll be on the rhythm when the beats start bouncin' up

I'll give you a minute just to get yourself together and
We can have a sing-along, all and together and
Here's to the netherlands, sistern and brethren
B-boy benevolence, birds of a feather and
It don't matter what you say
We all are connected
Some are on a rap path, some are mis-directed
When I say "who wrecked it" just like they expected
Aceyaloney-boy, accepted eclectic

Accepted ....Eclectic

(repeat)

Respect it

(repeat)

Yeah

Now how the god damn pot go and call the kettle black? that bull shit
Yo, but this ain't though
Chapter 7, Verse 1, Attention

[Hook]

All Balls Don't Bounce, some balls roll and some balls hang
And some people have a ball doin' they thang
Now what's the result? Your life is biased
All one-sided surrounded by liars

Trials and tribs
It's all ad-libs, and all breakin' you a coupla ribs
Now what if I breaks the tail on the lizard
Is it gonna grow back?
It is and you know that
But that ain't the case
I picture the place
I capture a kodak and show dat face
You're just a shit stain on the draws of life
And the trials of life, and the styles of life
You won't be happy 'till you lost your life
Or lose your mind, or die of boredom
Or try to kill 'em all and let your God sort 'em
Better earn your keep, and learn to leap
Or burn in your sleep
Tryin' to get a little somethin, yo I peep
You bein devoted, but you shoulda let it seep thru the mask you sported

[With Hook in background]
You ended up a swiggler caught in a swiggle
Just gimme the signal
And I'll state the terms
As long as I can be there with fate to change
You smokin sherm
Or whatever the name, you're a trivial part in a trivia game
Now what's your aim? a presidential campaign
Like Ross Perot, he lost it though
But he got a billion in da bank for show
Oh me I'm po' and you like me
But I don't like you, nigga you all fronts
And I won't let one apple spoil the bunch
Now get yo' hat & get yo' coat
All afloat, we goin' back to the real
I got a question, answer me this
What if me and you got caught in a twist
And you accidentally got caught by the fist
What's the gist, or what's the justice
Or better yet what if I had got busted
For tryin to go out like General Custer
Well kiss yo' family, meet me at the juncture
Better have a little bit a acupuncture
I reckon that you gonna have to smoke another bongload to get you enough
To open your mouth
Because I doubt that you know what it's really about

[Hook]

Heard you keep your jewels in a safe
That ain't safe with a $10 locket
I keep mines in between my front pockets
Cause I'm a darkie and they want me
Castrated, assassinated, well here's your merit
Better wear it
With pride, just don't get all mushy inside
And don't get pushy
Or wishy washy, your heart is squishy
When it should be strong, your tail is bushy
When you shouldn't even have one
Do you want another big hit of the bong?
All Balls Don't Bounce, now you wanna get indignant
Show your stupidity and act all ig'nant
Now you got pigment, so you my kin
It's like the hand it's still on ice
So you might starve tryin' to carve you a slice
With a little brown rice and some black eye peas
Or 2 black eyes and 2 broke knees
And 2 broke niggas tryin to steal the cheese
Got family ties, your family's giving
Your family tries, your family's living
Your family croaks, dies of a stroke
And that's the end, but then you awoke
As a baby again
So in your next life you can be squabbler
And eat peach cobbler till you get fat
You can even live in a manshion or a wigwam
Just remember all balls go flat

Yeah! Woo-coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh
Yeah! Ace One!
Yeah, and you know what I told you
I don't do this for myself
I do this strictly one hundred percent.. for you
{*scratched in background: "This one, for you and you and you"*}

[Hook]
Yeah, I do it all for you, I do it all for you
I do it all for you, I do it all for you

They put me on the wrong world, yes they did
Star on my forehead bless this kid
They threw me in headfirst, blind in the dark
In the alligator pit with the rest of the sharks
All I could think about was how they set me apart
I never knew a killer whale who had so much bark
The heart of a lion, I'm sharp as a dart
And it took me a long while to master the art
{*scratched: "This one, for you and you and you"*}
You know why?

[Hook]

[Aceyalone]
I'm Aceyalone, how can I be of service?
What else do you need besides superb wordage?
Man I stay heated like a burner from the furnace
My shoes always brown, same color as my shirt is
I write authentic, always all in it
Outside the law, raw, never fall timid
Always ahead of myself, pushing past the limit
We taught the world to freestyle now it's a epidemic

{*scratched: "This one, for you and you and you"*}
Yeahhhh! Woo-coo-coo-coo-coo!

[Hook]

[Aceyalone]
I walked the long mile just because I had to
I'll be glad to add to the pile if I have to
Ain't a situation on earth that I can't adapt to
I do what I got to, and a little of that too
I am what I am but that ain't all I can be
Spend a lifetime trying to big up the family
I leave 'em with they eyes open wider than Bambi
They don't understand me, that's why they abandon me

{*scratched: "This one, for you and you and you"*}
Yeah! Yes man!

[Hook]

[Aceyalone]
I'm always on next and ready to bust it up
Work hard, play hard, never a customer
Skills stay hardy at the party for sustenance
Man I'm on the grind, I'm a non-stop hustler
I'll fight the fight that nobody will fight though
Spite those fools that be trying to bite dope
I'm like no other MC on the mi-cro
I might go psycho, keeping it tight though

{*scratched: "This one, for you and you and you"*}
One two! Yeah yeah, yeah yeah!

[Hook]

[Aceyalone]
No guts, no glory, it's the same ol' story for
I'm out with my nightstick, cruising the corridor
They always wanna ask why you swinging that sword of yours
Because I'm a warrior, killing them more and more
Who you gonna call when there's so many to choose from
You win some, lose some, now who wanna do some'
A new somebody who be trying to prove some'
Now I gotta move some, and give you a new sum

{*scratched: "This one, for you and you and you"*}
Woo-coo-coo-coo! Yeah-heah!

[Hook]

[Aceyalone]
Yeah I'll put a fire to the house that Jack built
I rose from the grave for the people that crack killed
My name on my buckle when I'm wearing my black belt
I gave you half the world now tell me how that felt
Cause anywhere you go, I'll be right behind you
And if you don't know, then I gotta remind you
Hold on to your parachute and jump when it's time to
Cause I was designed to have the people to rhyme to

{*scratched: "This one, for you and you and you"*}
No shit! Yeah-h-h, didn't you know?

[Hook]Yo I met this queen yo I met this queen named annalillia

Annalillia oh annalillia
Annalillia oh annalillia
Annalillia oh annalillia
I bet you think I'm silly huh annalillia
Annalillia oh annalillia
Annalillia oh annalillia
Annalillia oh annalillia
I bet you think I'm silly huh annalillia

Now I was in a bar when I met annalillia
Drunk and high drinkin' shots of tequillia
Chasin' it with genuine draft
Tellin' wack jokes as the bartender laughed
I was about one drink away from my limit
In came a black dress w/a black body in it
She looked so timid
It took me a minute
To get her in focus
He said what'll it be
And just so she could notice Acey I said yo this one's on me
And she stormed
I don't even know who you are fool
Keepin' that barstool warm like Norm
Then it hit me
Right there center in my heartbeat
Shot down but I loved it
I was talkin' out the bottom of a shot glass anyways
I says I insist that I pays
By the ways
What your mama name you what they call you
Can I call you and soon claim you
I was diggin' a hole I knew i'd fall through
But I aimed to just understand her
A woman that not many men knows
She looked me in my windows and said annalillia
Annalillia?

Annalillia oh annalillia
Annalillia oh annalillia
Annalillia oh annalillia
I mean well really uh annalillia
Annalillia oh annalillia
Annalillia oh annalillia
Annalillia oh annalillia
You wanna smoke this philly huh annalillia

Now once I broke the ice on the lake the water felt cold
But nevertheless it was water
My conversation caught her
Some daddy's daughter and my mama's son
Said I'm Acey de uno and I do know how to have fun
I comes from the hills
1 in a mil
2 out of 3 ain't bad
4 a 5 dollar bill
And a half a dozen thrills
Just see how it feels
7 8 9
Now he pre-10's (pretends) he's real
And she thought that was so funny
And she put her drink away went to pay w/her money and squirted
All because a brother just flirted
And didn't know how to word it
I blurted out the door but she never heard it
Then annalillia deserted

Annalillia oh annalillia
Annalillia oh annalillia
Annalillia oh annalillia
I bet you think I'm silly huh annalillia
Annalillia oh annalillia
Annalillia oh annalillia
Annalillia oh annalillia
I mean well really uh annalillia

Now I was in my car when I seen annalillia again
Hmm w/her friend
Yo haven't we met before
Of course we have
We crossed paths at a local pub
And I was like a lickle drunk on everything I love
I didn't mean to run you off but I did
I must have put too much on it to make you pop your lid
But you did
But what you did for me physically and mentally
Got my chemistry just like goin' you just not knowin'
Well anyway ok let's try this again
We might as well be friends and do what friends do
Foxy lady brown sugar mama karma queen you
Don't think I'm a fiend
Just give me your number and i'll give you a ring
Tingalingaling
She said first of all I got a boyfriend
And a girlfriend
And a couple of rugrats and a cat
Splat
Ooh she threw me all out of my game
She was open like a button-fly
So I asked myself the what and the why
So I said self what are you doin'
Why are you canoeing when you could have a motorboat instead
Then I told her hold her head peace
This ain't what I wanted
But right before I shook the spot I said let me tell you somethin'
Annalillia I'm proud to announce
That all balls don't bounce
And that's all that counts
I'm out

Annalillia oh annalillia
Annalillia oh annalillia
Annalillia oh annalillia
I mean well really uh annalilliaCheck it out y'all...
This is Aceyalone on the microphone
And we got my nigga Punish on the beatbox
And we gonna show you how WE does it...

Anywhere you go
I am going to find you
And every time you flow
I'll be right behind you
Just to let you know and
Constantly remind you
You can never be as dope as I am
God-damn

Now I know you hate it when the MC ain't fly
So I come in the party live
Chopping rappers down to size
I know em when I see em cause they got that look in their eyes
Surprise
Aceyalone has arrived
They surround around the microphone like shit attracts flies
I arise
The Thai gets me high
I find him, stand right behind him and I spy
No more than two tries; either freaks it or you die
I waited; somebody stated "He's intimidated"
I was faded; I played it like any other brother would've played it
Nut soon as I grabbed the microphone I went into a frenzy
Started givin niggas black eyes like Spuds Mackenzie
When that bud's in me
Now one of these niggas tried to tell me my shit was hopeless
His homeboy was on the other side sayin "Man your shit's the dopest"
All of a sudden another rapper pushed his way through the crowd
Came and stood in front of me and told me he was proud
Then he bowed, told me that he liked the way I styled
I thanked him, I smiled
Then I had to be out

Cause everywhere you go
I am going to find you
And every time you flow
I'll be right behind you
Just to let you know and
Constantly remind you
You can never be as dope as I am
God-damn

Now I'mma give shout out to all the dope MC's in the world...
Y'all know who you are

You know I got the kinda style that everybody yearns
I mic check; I break a niggas nectar like Kerns
Cause you are a worm, you are a germ
And you are about to be stepped on
So you should be concerned
IIf you have a perm then it's permanent
It's affirmative you will burn
Make a right turn turn
Then a left turn
Then a u-turn turn
Come all the way back, return
Stand stern and maybe you just might learn
About the firm
I used to be a sperm -- shoot
Got derm
Nobody better not squirm
Til my meeting is adjourned
Okay I'm through
And I rock from here to Peru
Vern
I could've sworn you knew
That AC's having a rap sale
You wanna buy 1 or 2?
Or 3 or 4 or 5
Or 6 or 7 or 8
Or 9 or 10 or 11
Or 12 or 13 or 14?
Cause me and the mic are courting
My circuit breaker's shorting
My memory is aborting
I can barely remember this flow
But wack MC's ya still got another zillion miles or so to go to catch me

Anywhere you go
I am going to find you
And every time you flow
I'll be right behind you
Just to let you know and
Constantly remind you
You can never be as dope as I am
God-damn

They pushed that rapper in front of the train
Took him to the doctor sewed his arm on again
Stabbed that rapper (emcee) right in his heart
Gave him a transplant for a brand new start
And then he stopped; he started again
He forted bounced it and vomited
Now you know who's the dominant dog
That got to be given you that rhyme style
Man child, locked in the promised land
I'mma stand in the middle of an open hand
That's extensive
Cause I don't flow religously or relentlessly
For innocent-minded-ticity
Okay I win and the battle's like over
Got a sattelite Rover
With a rocket telescopic sprocket pocket pulley
And a fully automatic stun gun cause I'm a bully
My hair was wooly I'm a muillion
A calmer Jeffrey Dahmer hater
I'm greater than the latest greatest innovators
Can go to hell, cause I say this so well
You can whistle my melody or noel
You're still gonna get the Speak n Spell
I get my ink from inkwell
My paper from the trees
I swell up when I eat MCs
So eat these
And stand at attention
Did I forget to mention
My classes aren't expensive
That's if you are an uncomprehensive
Defensive sensitive
Toy rapper
Little boy rapper
Momma's wittle wappin man wapper
Now you got me reachin for my zapper
I'll cut you off with a clapper
But that's for old gentlemen
Who drink coffee with cinnamon, it'll take ten of them
Then again did I mention I'm potent
Totin holdin reloadin votin
With my channel changer fool
And since I don't speak Greek stranger
I'mma give it to you in layman's terms so you'll learn...

Anywhere you go
I am going to find you
And every time you flow
I'll be right behind you
Just to let you know and
Constantly remind you
You can never be as dope as I am
God-damnOh yes welcome to hiphology please open up your workbooks to page
And break out your pads and pens and your calculators
For the first lesson of today is

[Hook]
Arhythamatic arhythamaticulas
This rhythm is sick this rhythm's ridiculous
Arhythamatic arhythamaticulas
This rhythm is sick this rhythm's ridiculous

[Verse 1]
Well up until now your only concept of rhythm is a four by four loop
Square as a pool table
With no dynamics implanted but you couldn't understand
Why all of your gigantic rap sounded so bland
But the answer was right in your hand
Couldn't believe you were so naive to
Arrangements changes different time signatures
The freedom of your imagination that must have been a fixation with blocks
Like tryin to make a wheel out of rock
Like tryin to make a puppet out of sock
See I got that private stock the personal vat with the broth and gravy
And the electrons to pass on so the world don't seem so wavy
Oh everybody hollerin save me save yourself before it's too late into the
When you go because my wig got weight I gotta concentrate on

[Hook]
Arhythamatic arhythamaticulas
This rhythm is sick this rhythm's ridiculous
Arhythamatic arhythamaticulas
This rhythm is sick this rhythm is outta control

[Verse 2]
Yeah now everybody in here check your head and make sure that it's spacious
And open up the middle just a millimeter more for the style that is bodacious
You really wanna know who the Ace is
Ace is the face that's seldom sighted
I'm divided into two parts I got two hearts
Two heads I'm a head ahead one of the better bred
Know you're thinkin I'm gonna be I got the remedy to turn you out
I got the fiery styles that'll burn you out if you don't learn that route
Now I been there done that did it committed to run that
Talk to it do it right
Me and this mic gonna take flight to end your mental plight
Hip hop is more than yes y'all
Throw your hands in the air say ho
And give up the W cause I'm from the west y'all
And you know I got mad fat flow
Coming in the house through the back door out the front door
Cross the frontyard into the street
We could do it right here better yet I got a better idea
I'm a get you up off your feet with that

[Hook]
Arhythamaticulas arhythamatic
This rhythm's ridiculous this rhythm is sick
Arhythamaticulas arhythamatic
This rhythm's ridiculous this rhythm is sick

[Verse 3]
Now the problem with you MC's today is you're too emotional
You have no devotion to the social bug spread
By the words you said to the public
You have no regard for the masses how you effect them
And how they view you
Now you know you knew you were open wide for the
Whole wide world to do you
Now I propose those who chose their flows
Irresponsible and irrationally
Be exhausted from the face of the earth and be forced to deal w/me
Me i'd rather be undefined not underestimated or undermined
I'm underlined as the underdog under the influence of time
Now I know you're sick of that same old same old
Lame old running man dance style
Niggas screamin' and yellin' and tellin' lies about what they do
Brother I say to you but don't you believe or be deceived
By the hip hop that you breath
I am multidirectional I move randomly and professional
Intellectual with perpetual
First in motion bustin' you open
Now you are exposed to the rap and closed in the mind trap I find that
Hilarious and mysterious every area gets a dose
Full of malaria and asbestos from the west coast
Breath in and coat your lungs

[Hook]
Arhythamatic arhythamaticulas
This rhythm is sick this rhythm's ridiculous
Arhythamatic arhythamaticulas
This rhythm is sick this rhythm's ridiculous

Arhythametic
Tic tic tic

Arhythamatic arhythamaticulas
This rhythm is sick sick sick[ Aceyalone ]
Yeah
Ah, this one's out of respect
To you and yours
Ah

I'm a b-boy, I'm the real McCoy
I'm chocolate all over like an Almond Joy

What's up party people in the place to be
Gather round for a minute and check the MC
I really don't know what you expectin from me
But I was born and raised to rock over the beat
See, me and my homies got some tight-ass raps
It is time we put the hometeam back on the map
All you radio stations play a whole lotta crap
It's like I'm hungry at the table and you feedin me scrap
So this one's for the people who can ride the wave
And go into the battle and come out unscathed
See, my only regret is that I probably never gave
Enough back to hip-hop for the life it saved
So ride along with us as we lick this shot
For anybody who put it down, we never forgot
See, we give it all we got, cause it's how we was taught
And it only takes a second just to blow up the spot

I'm a b-boy, I'm the real McCoy
I'm chocolate all over like an Almond Joy (5X)

[ Abstract Rude ]
We keep it lit like weed, indeed the rare breed
They barely did enough of us for their needs
Our fans, some r&b, most hip-hop and rave
I'm dark-skinned, baby, and I get you sun-bathed
Once the track's laid that Jissm made
I become a slave to the beat, don't know how to behave
We kept it true, what else did you expect us to do?
Now I'm beggin you to come and spin a record or two
I'm on the prowl in the here and now I'll be cold
To you so-called MC's who wanna get bold
You'll be showed in the worst ways
I'm seasoned for battle cause of Project Blowed Thursdays
I'm a wordsmith, now that we've settled into two thou
(Two thou) we gotta represent somehow (somehow)
It's talent in the ghetto that we'll have to employ
With melanin in em they'll seek to destroy

I'm a rudeboy, I'm the real mccoy
I'm chocolate all over like an Almond Joy (5X)

[ both ]
You wanna make noise, make noise

[ Aceyalone (& Abstract Rude) ]
B-boys make some noise (b-boys)
B-girls make some noise
(It's workin)
Work it out
Work it out
(It's workin)
Like that

[ Aceyalone ]
Cause we was at the party when the jam was live
And it really wasn't poppin until we arrived
We was hangin out at the club before we can drive
With big afros like the Jackson Five
Comin out the house late, makin it home safe
B-boys in the place, just had to show my face
Soon after that I discovered my instrument
As soon as I picked her up we got intimate
Big up to my homeboys who know this tune
Microphone Mike and my man T-Spoon (Heavyweight)
Aceyalone just stepped in the room
Now we know the flavor's in here the party resumes

Cause I'm a b-boy, I'm the real McCoy
I'm chocolate all over like an Almond Joy (2X)
I'm a b-boy...

Respect to the fallen soldiers in hip-hop
And all the fallen soldiers across the world in the struggle
Alright
Easy[Abstract Rude telephone message]
*May 18th, at 5:12pm*
"Yo Grouch, what's up? It's Ab
Uh, I'm out here man, hit me up, hit me up at the office
I got this idea for this song I want to do with you
Um, hopefully we can do that shit
Um, I don't know what I'mma call it
But the hook is like
'Blood's thicker than water, but dicks are no stronger than pussies
Friends should last longer but it gets ugly
Push me to the point of no return
Fools they waste sperm and cool bridges they burn
Blood's thicker than water...'
I can hear me and you fucking up some shit on that
Anyway..."

[Aceyalone]
Does a woman make a man feel like a man
Because she's giving him the pussy hole?
Does a man make a woman feel like a woman
Cause he said she was sweeter than a Tootsie Roll?
Yeah, with self-control she'll be first on the scroll
But it's all about the scrotum and the pole
And that feeling that just takes a hold of most people
The pussy and the dick are equal, both deceitful
Some niggas ain't got control of they ding-a-ling
Forget about everything when they start tingling
And some gals can't stop mingling
Need someone to scratch the itch, bitch keep jingling
But mother nature's more powerful than you think
After a couple drinks, you'll hit it if it stinks
Cause ain't nobody perfect and plus
Babies have to be born and nuts have to be bust
Adjust, don't fuck over somebody you trust
Going head over heels over lust, but life is real

[Hook: Abstract Rude]
Blood's thicker than water, but dicks are no stronger than pussies
Friends should last longer, but it gets ugly
Push me like a button, nothing earned
Fools, they waste sperm and cool bridges they burn
Blood's thicker than water, but dicks are no stronger than pussies
Friends should have honor, but it gets ugly
Push me like a button, nothing earned
Fools, they waste sperm and cool bridges they burn

[The Grouch]
Now if you had the opportunity to fuck off things with you and me
Over a breezy, then you probably would
Hopefully I wouldn't trip, but naturally I should
And actually if we were close, it would be to the good
Cause if you was using judgement and wasn't on no love shit
An example of how blood's thick is me being cool
Rule of thumbs, you've heard them like M.O.B. and friends too
I've got too much game and business to attend to to cry
And though I'd be the first to ask you why
And I'd definitely be upset to catch you in a lie
Wouldn't be the first time that sharing was caring
Ask Eligh how it goes down, tempers aren't always flaring
Staring at the situation open-minded
The only way to go cause time can't be rewinded
Find it in your interest not to fool with my wife though
Cause what would happen then is something that you wouldn't like to know

[Hook: Aceyalone]

[Abstract Rude]
What's up baby? I see you making moves
You've got a point to prove, and issues with Rude
I showed you love, fed you food, hooked you up with my troops
Around you place sipping blues, didn't even make you pay dues
Even when I had pick and choose for you, I was in the mood
And see I, I'm a hardcore stuck in the war
Can't take many more first night scores out on tour
The pure thought whispers settle down, don't mess around
The young mind, yeah wants to find what's new in town
But I can't blame ya, call you out then name ya (biatch!)
Hell I'm an entertainer, L.A. underground rap star
Who ain't got that far, it'll be our little secret
For sure something you'll regret and sleep with
I swallow pride, plus the envious and jealous love
Slow to anger, not a glutton, comes with high cost
Of blood loss that's worse than having no water
And dick and pussy is weak, and that'll get you caught up
Look at you tryna run through my whole crew
You hitting speed bumps, it's a rocky road boo
It's a rocky road boo

[Hook: The Grouch]Artist: The Nonce f/ Aceyalone
Album: World Ultimate
Song: Bus Stops

Chorus:

They on the bus stops
They out bumpin' the sound
They at every mall in the city
Take a look at `em cruising around
(2X)

Nouka:

I seen this girl yo around the way
She kicked over there where my homegirl stay
I've been known to step up and make them swoon to me
It's just a job of being devastating MCs
When I'm looking for a freak you know it ain't no stress
I get they minds tight and then you out that dress
So when I roll up and say what's your name
Showing them thighs driving me insane
Don't try to front cause I saw you look
I know your thinking `bout how much time I took
So now I'm out on the town with my alias
Getting all freaks in my radius
Shine was fly so was Michelle
Denise and Keanna broke me off real well
So if you in the city and you got it like that
Yusef won't you tell `em where the honeys is at

Chorus

AceyAlone: Hey, goes down_I'm AceyAlone on WKAC on your FM dial
Now this is to all the ladies, a little something for your tummies
Now where they at_

Yusef:

Now I am not the one to be flossing see
About the Janes everyday that'll flock to me
And yes I see them round the way cause they all got fame
You know the brothers realize cause we peep that game
From LaShawn down to Kim plus Antoinette
Little Keesha and Shareeka can't forget Fissette
For the jibs that'll make a nigger nature rise
You see I gotta put them down just to recognize
From the neighborhood spot where they all might gather
From the phone conversation to the latest fad
I can't front or even stop cause the spot's quite hot
And like without the proper biz then you must shake the spots
So if you get an eye then you best pursue
Cause if your line's kind of late another John will do
And if, you see Tamika tell her give me a ring
Now I'm a let the cable go so the guys can sing

Chorus

Nouka:

In summer dresses and braided hair
And faded fros really make me stare
I'm talking `bout the girls who really know
Who nod they heads when the beat is slow
Sherrelle is the girl with the attitude
But I handled that right when I'm in the mood
Shae is the girl who's paging me
I'll call her when I'm finished on this M-I-C
One day I asked Kiki what her homegirls say
They say who is that baller over there today
Seeing these Janes is routine you see
I even like the girls who jock constantly
It's not that I be flossing nor nothing like that
I guess I'm just a player with that old school rap
Now if the sun is shining and it's really hot
My man won't you tell them `bout them honey spots

Chorus[Prevail]
Dukes and maharajahs pass the time of day with me
Dukes and maharajahs pass the time of day with me
Dukes and maharajahs pass the time of day with me
The earth's surface height is global
So watch the stealth sport
I freed you to the odd of firearms
I was a specimen of near perfection in a college professor's pod
Now I'm the only thing you should be fearing for the next millennium clearing
If only time will tell then I'll tell time
No secrets like he doesn't know
I throw beggar's bullets at baley's barn
There'll be bullets over Broadway for all of our faults

[Aceyalone]
People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones
People who live in glass houses don't throw stones
People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones
Because they risk having boulders crash down on their lovely homes
Thin wind rain sleet snow cones come showering through your roof
You need a fine toothed comb to find the truth
Well my house ain't made of glass and my chariot ain't no pumpkin
I'm not a backyard bumpkin I'm from the concrete slab
Where people taking
Anything and everything that they can grab
What's so bad is a whole lotta grabbin
A lotta jar jabbin
Gremlins, goblins, rappers squabbling
Amongst the ranks from the punks to the drunks
To the monks to the saints
Keep your eyes on your oxygen tank
The ears you ain't
Either you can or you can't
A heartbeat start skip stop off crank you go blank............

[Madchild]
The fascination of the infinite consumes me
The fascination of the infinite consumes me
The fascination of the infinite consumes me
Vitality to hurt you all in virtual reality actual natural plants enhanced
My words are crystal clear
Deep intensified trance in a relaxed atmosphere
Optional imagery high tech focal reprocessing
Metallic existence roams through the galaxy
Trails of stardust remain I crush you palace and fallacies
Warlords who swung swords
Now hide behind steel shields from the battle field
Mortal weaponry stays concealed as they kneel
Once my power cosmic's revealed

[Prevail]
I'm the piccadilly of the carnival
The unharnessable remarkable, the sheath that holds
The arguably truest tempered sword in the western world
I'm ahead of my time and I'm heading your way
A word of warning
The world is turning
Torquing and contorting
While a ball of gas is burning
Meteor shower warnings leaving grind and grit and granite winding
The second hand towards the finding of tablets
For derelicts and martyrs puppeteers and marauders
Juggernaughts and argonaughts
Who are sparking irons to butter into waters uncharted..

[Madchild]
Now into the labyrinth of madchild's amusement
More intense than the shining you're in a difficult course
Feel the pressure from all angles of prev's centrifugal force
Unremorseful sorcery firing flames more frequent
And strengthen the attacker and black magic clashing in sequence
My activities are extra curricular one particular
Immaculate masculine muscular rap spectacular
Cohesion casting curses and articulate verses

[Aceyalone]
What do you do when there's no response to your distress signal
When your SOS is busy is he dead or alive
Since I put my mind in overdrive
I've derived this method of meshing and molding
Shaping and holding on
To this golden microphone
Alone in the wilderness
Skill less yet fearless
I've experienced your experiences once already
Now once you're ready
I'll re-dream your dreamscapelandscapeskyscrapeskydive
In a swan lake chasing beat breaks we can take a cake walk
Through my program and talk
Megabites gigabites kilohertz
And electric inserts
I can pole vault with a lightning bolt over the wall of china
And cruise my cruise liner
Tryingtofindafinerrhyme and if I decide to sink your
Lusitanian there'll be pandemonium mania
Drown in to my aquarium terrarium......

[Prevail] dukes and maharajahs pass the time of day with me
[Aceyalone] people in glass houses, don't throw stones
[Madchild] the fascination of the infinite consumes me
[Aceyalone] consumption........[Aceyalone]
Aiyyo the police short Cornbread in the street
And they just killed Cochise over a beat

Ah man, I'm just a brother whose intentions are good
Oh lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
I gotta 10 fifty-fo' under the hood
Several stages of lifespan, damned if I would
Be a dope when it's not a laughin matter
Modern contemporary man still hunt and gather data
They want glamour, the priceless prize
Give 'em a torch and they put the fire to your eyes
Give 'em a inch they take a yard and they pull your card
Throw a wrench so far in yours it'll leave a scar
Raise the bar, I pass it with the right scholastics
They made it plastic, that's why they couldn't grasp it
I always knew that you would fail me
Once shame on me twice you shouldn't have to tell me
And I'll be damned if I'll let you get away with that
I just ain't playin that, that's that bullshit!

Jardine and the kids tryin to make ends me
Half dead and do dirty as some God damn thiefs

Yo - hold your head up, you only got your life left
Make the right step and don't sing the wrong song
Fight somebody your own damn size
You dead wrong, thinkin you won't meet yo' demise
This baby here, gon' grow up to be a king
I don't know how you seein things, but that's a fact
It'll be over my dead body
If I let you put a mother{fuckin} monkey on his back
Shit ain't changed, it's just the choices
The voices in your head sayin do what you don't gotta do
They scared of themselves which means that they scared of me
And them the same, punk-ass fools that shot at you
The lord giveth and he taketh away
God bless that I can live to see another day
And if I had it my way I'd hang you all by the neck
Have some respect, I'll serve and protect

Aiyyo the police short Cornbread in the street
And they just killed Cochise over a beat

And if my teachers could see you now
They'll take your head, cause you probably wouldn't even bow
You ain't humble, you mumble jumble
Your tower of so-called power'll crumble
You killed my uncle, put a dagger through my brother's heart
I need another start, cause if I knew then
What I know now, it'll be wild
Booyaka! Booyaka! I'll put you in the ground
A peaceful man ain't got no place here
I guess you wanna see 'em all die with the lambs
I face fear everyday 'til the space is clear
Then I fight 'em like a man cause it's what I am
Somebody told me the road to freedom is lonely
But I swear I ain't goin on my own
I'm takin my sisters, my families, my homies
Now I'm about to take this mother(fucker) home

Aiyyo the police short Cornbread in the street
And they just killed Cochise over a beat
Jardine and the kids tryin to make ends me
Half dead and do dirty as some God damn thiefsBreath out breath in breath out

There's a MC flowin' deep and wide deep and wide
Rhymes I got plenty keep 'em right by my side
Come and get a flow jump inside the boat for the ride
There's a MC flowin' deep and wide deep and wide

Now everybody up odd man in
Fit to play a game of russian roulette and God's fit to win
I hope you're equip for the adventure men to the front
And the women and children to the back of the boat
Fit to be afloat in about fifty seconds
Better believe we brought enough free chicken for the picnic
And while the time is tickin'
Automated belt drive felt tip scribe I'm your guide
To the innermost outtermost post to the other side
Now my body is my temple and my temple is my prize
And my mind shine like the sun do
And here's a little word from the wise
You go up the river down the creek cross the lake
And over the stream tryin' to escape this MC

There's a MC flowin' deep and wide deep and wide
- what is it

MC's flowin' deep and wide deep and wide
Rhymes we got plenty keep 'em right by our sides
Come and get a flow jump inside the boat for the ride
There's a MC flowin' deep and wide deep and wide
- what is it

Obviously this happens periodically
It's not me it's the god in me I'm rappin' so melodically
Aeronautically Aaron is I, Aaron is high, Aaron is flying
Why in me means the glare in your eye
They're in the lyin' down postion
The music's a masseuse
Goin' through your body makin' all the tension loose
Audio boost their reaction means satisfaction
Seems to happen when I'm rappin' and they hear me clearly
And cheering even teary-eyed in the b-boy kingdom
We some rude stylish scattin rappin world twists
But that's just for audio analysis
The dopest you diagnose this
But still don't get too close this
May have a ferocious side
There's and MC flowin' by deep and open wide
- what is it

MC's flowin' deep and wide deep and wide
Rhymes we got plenty keep 'em right by our sides
Come and get a flow jump inside the boat for the ride
There's a MC flowin' deep and wide deep and wide
- what is it

Breath out breath in breath out
- yo Ab feel the wind blowin'
Breath in breath out
Breath in breath out

I am a universal soldier[Intro: Mystic]
It was so beautiful
Remember how in love we were?
So in love
So in love
Once
So in love
Once

[Verse 1: Aceyalone]
She was a young girl
I was a young man
And I knew they would get her when I let go her hand
And then I let go
The inevitable
So beautiful
And susceptible
So wonderful
And so innocent
And after this neither one of us would benefit
Yeah, I was a dropout
She was a graduate
She said I’ll never be nothing she wasn’t having it
Yeah, I tried to break her down
I tried to reason it
She said I wasn’t nobody to be believing in
Yeah, what a waste of time
What a waste of mind
Your place of mind was a part of the design
Yeah, I used to call her up
She never called back
When she called that said I wasn’t all that
Yeah, I know that times change
And people change, too
I was a fool just to think that I could change you

[Hook: Mystic]
Everyone’s got stories gone
About a love we once knew
So high in the beginning
Until the world cuts through
And then everything changes
Nothing feels the same
Piece by piece it falls apart until
All that’s left is blame

[Verse 2: Aceyalone]
And if I had a chance to do it all over I’d do it exactly the same
I was a b-boy
She was a good girl
Turned hot girl
Had to be a hood girl
Never did she notice she would end up in a shook world
I was like look girl it’s all in the book
Yeah, I used to tell her jokes
I used to make her laugh
And if I had a whole dollar I would give her half
So delicate
And so intelligent
And then she trying to play me out just for the hell of it
Back when she was 19 not even 21
Used to do a thing getting somebody anyone
Thought that she was naive
Or was it really me
I do believe
She was the one that wasn't feeling me
So we broke up at a barbecue
Drove home thinking never will I bother you
Yeah, I just didn’t know
What it was hidden for
She had me sitting low
But she was bullshitting, though

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Aceyalone]
So I just kept rhyming
I caught her eye again
Next thing you know she was hollering let’s try again
But I wasn’t buying in
Didn’t want to lie again
Love was in the frying pan
Baby, it’s done
But she started hanging out
And started being seen
Seeing things different
Said she wasn’t being mean
Yeah, if I let her in
Then I let her win
But I’m a veteran what’s better than a friend
Maybe she was an angel
But she’s in disguise
And I just didn’t see the God-light in her eyes
Or maybe I should I walk away
And cut all the ties
Stay on the rise
Leave love left where love dies
We were youngsters
But we’re older now
But the world is a little more colder now
And I’m just trying to get it all off my shoulder now
Baby, you can hold it down
I’ll see you in the wind

[Hook]

[Outro: Aceyalone]
That’s right, baby
Next life time
Yeah, ain’t that what they say?
Check it out
Love don’t hate
I got love for you
Always[Aceyalone]
Freedom is that cold road seldom traveled, by the multitude
We need to depict to describe it, so that we can cultivate this food
Motivate a few of you fools, regenerate the mood
Free ourselves from mental bondage, free ourselves from Family Feuds
Now follow me through this prophecy, building our colonies
Where our pillars and columns be, bigger than the coliseum
I call 'em like I see 'em, the devil does a devil's dance
They wanna murder Mumia, take action, it's the only chance

[Tre Hardson]
Now they will flee and guard, just to feel the power
Not to justify, that of you and I
Holdin' daggers up and lettin' you decide
After passin' information that's falsified
Stand behind a lie, what does it cost to die?
What does it cost to live? Why do they specify?
These terms of why, when they ain't the most high
They fear they will kill, but the soul will never die

[Zack de la Rocha]
You see the capital thugs got nervous
Cause he refused to be their servant
Cause he spit truth that shook heads and burn like black churches
Prose and verses, filled with a million black hearses
Watch, see the decision of Dred Scott as it reverses
So as long as their rope is tight around Mumia's neck
Let there be no rich white life we bound to respect
Cause and effect, can you smell the smoke in the breeze?
My Panther, my brother, we are at war until you're free

[Jean Grae]
I plan to move my motherfuckers to the frontline, ready with guns cockin'
We storm prisons, get the wards rockin'
Snipe all the F.B.I. and cops clockin'
Philly officials, bodies droppin'
Offends the eighty-five, bombin'
Eye for an eye, we'll hang 'em by the Capitol Steps
Snap their necks, snatch their vests, equip my children with techs
Free from the protected Feds, called it murder, legal execution shit
Free the righteous or face the bloody revolutionists song

[Divine Styler]
In the holy month of Ramadan, doin' time, war and degrees
Within the means of God's speed, feel the supreme penalties
Black non-fiction, remains the weapon of choice
Reject the illusion of justice and white hears the black voice
The passion behind the file, the flesh beyond the bars
Through the spirit of under force, who's deaf and who's cost?
Break the black man down in front of the black fam and all
Guilty as you all, free Mumia Abu-Jamal

[P.E.A.C.E.]
This is a P.S.A. to the P.S.C. and the P.P.D
Mumia Abu-Jamal must be set free
How would y'all like it if we took it to the streets
In a discrete fashion? Still smashin', underground arsenal of lyricists
Live from death row
We want the voices of the voices fully clothed and ready to go
And if not, you'll witness the largest uprisin' you've even seen befo'
April twenty-fo', nineteen fifty-fo'Talkin' shit while he was rollin' his weed
My nigga hit him in the face
(broken blunts, broken fronts)
He didn't know that disrespect would lead to such a serious case
(broken law, broken jaw)
If you knew how to read the situation you would stay in your place
(broken arm socket, broken pocket)
If there's one thing that everyone needs, it's they goddamn space
Let me talk about it as I rock it

Give me five feet
All around the world
I don't want nobody touchin' me unless it's my girl
I give a pound, a hug, some love, but that's that
Don't be tapping me on the shoulders
Or pattin' me on the back
Or pull on my arm
Checkin' my size
I'm liable to do you harm
My temple is my prize
I'm wise and on the real-ly
I ain't too touch feel-ly
If you put your hands upon me I might just smack you silly
It's a billion people--touch somebody else, touch yo'self
I'll be sure to get at you if I'm needin' your help
But until then, maybe when I'm dead and stiff
But to touch you wit'out touchin' you is one of my gifts

Talkin' shit while she was drunk at the bar
My homey slapped her in the face
(dirty mouth, dirty dress)
She didn't know that disrespect would lead to such a serious case
(broken heel, broken nail)
If she knew how to read the situation she would stay in her place
(broken chain, broken locket)
If there's one thing that everyone needs, it's they goddamn space
Let me talk about it as I rock it

Why you all up up up under me, screamin' in my ear?
Why you tryin' to talk over the music when you know we barely can hear?
Why you tuggin' on my coattail, grabbin' on my sleeve?
Yo, cover your mouth when you cough 'round me
Don't touch me when you sneeze
I don't like disesase
And I don't wanna give you what I got
Yeah I'll hit the weed but what I don't need
Is somebody always in my spot
Standin' where I'm standin'
Breathin' down my neck
Yo, have some respect
I guess you think that water ain't wet
Just back the fuck up
No, I ain't stuck up
I just don't wanna hear your moans and groans and hiccups and stuff
And report it with the tape recorders all in my grille
But to touch you wit'out touchin' you is one of my skills

Talkin' shit while he was up on the mic
Somebody hit him in the face
(broken nose, broken flows)
He didn't know that disrespect would lead to such a serious case
(dirty rap, dirty scrap)
If he knew how to read the situation he would stay in his place
(broken eye socket tryin' to block it)
If there's one thing that everyone needs, it's they goddamn space
Let me talk about it as I rock it

Now I'm 'a draw the lines in the ground and show you my square
It's at least arm's distance, so stand over there
Hey love, you know I miss you, and how we embrace
But I'll let you know if I wanna kiss you or see how you taste
Yo, we all got issues we need to face
So don't think I'm tryin' to dis' you when I tell you the case
In case you're wonderin', it's just like that
I'm like there's telepathy
I already know what you're gonna say before you step to me
I hate croweded elevators in downtown rush
Packed trains
Craszy-ass people on the bus
Somtimes I roll plush
Lookin' so Cold Crush
But I'd rather teleport through space so y'all can bite my dust
Use body language baby
I can dig that
But homey you need to kick back and relax on the Ac'
The bottom line is don't invade nobody's zone
Or maybe owe
Sincerely, Aceyalone

Talkin' shit while he was walkin' the street
Somebody shot him in the face
(hurt brother, hurt mother)
He didn't know that disrespect would lead to such a serious case
(makin' waves, makin' days)
If you knew how to read the situation you would stay in your place
(cause you don't understand it don't knock it)
If there's one thing that everyone needs, it's they goddamn space
Let me talk about it as I rock it

Give me five feet all around the world
Give me a zone
My space, my square
And to each his own
To each man and woman and child[Intro: LuckyIAm]

Ah man. yes
I knew I was gonna get this beat
You gotta love it
This shit makes me fucking happy, you have no idea
Let me tell you about my baby

[Verse 1: LuckyIAm]

It's simply indescribable
One I could write a song for, let me just ponder
In thoughts of you my mind wanders, wait let me correct that, I could write a book set
Yeah I speak your volume, turn up the volume
Problems I solve 'em, nerves I can calm 'em
They call me Lucky, yeah I'm like a charmer, but every word I'm saying to you, that's my honor. (I swear)
I put that on my mama's, mama's, mama's, mama, fuck my baby mama's drama
I'm a changed man, baby I'm just sayin'
We can music and love and keep it sailin'
Love Boat, no captain
We can make it happen without them restrictions that gives others limits
But trust me no gimmicks, ain't no gimmicks, trust me no gimmicks
Love, we gonna get it

[Hook:]

It's for you, you, yeah you
The truth
Everything I'm doing with you is the truth
Every moment living our lives that's the proof
Every moment living our lives keep it true

It's for you, you, yeah you, the truth
Everything I'm doing with you is the truth
Every moment living our lives that's the proof
Every moment living our lives keep it true

[Verse 2: Aceyalone]
Let's take it back to when I found you
I was hella with it and you was hella down too
I spotted you in a crowd through a whole bunch of wannabes crowding all around you
Then I got your attention, I broke the tension, it hasn't been the same since then
Did I forget to mention, me and you together like Ashford and Simpson? (Solid)
And what I wouldn't do for her
2, 4, 7, 3, 65 rude girl
You're really just a cool girl
Me and you against the world, headed to the future. (c'mon let's do this)
I know I'm a lot to handle though, unmanageable, at times I'm an animal
But I'm a modern Michelangelo
And you're my last judgement and I need something tangible

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: Slug]

'Til I die, I'm by your side
A testament to the light you shine
If I needed any more excitement I'd have to grow some wings, start fighting crime
This life of mine, seen many miles of ebb & flow and nights alone
Aim my gun at the pretty smiles then run away so I can find my home
I was sitting on the front steps, wonderin' if death gonna come yet
That's when you cut through the mess
Improved my view and gave my blood breath
The negative got swept away, remember it like yesterday
You changed the way September taste and now I wanna live forever, thanks

[Hook:]Intro:

Oh man I got a splittin' headache
And my heart is broken up into a thousand tiny little microscopic pieces

Chorus:

I got a head full of headaches a heart that's full of woes
I'm constantly singin' them downhome blues and not many people knows
That leaves me with a twisted view of the whole wide world as I know it
And I guess I got no choice but to be a poet

Verse One:

Now in my natural habitat I gravitate towards having that
And I elevate on having that
And i'll never get caught in your rabbit trap
From Yellowstone to Venezuela
Nigeria down through Australia
There's somethin I learned that I gotta tell ya
There's a whole lot of us ain't wrapped too tight

Now I could been your doctor or your lawyer
Or come to your house and clean up for ya
Self destruction won't destroy ya
If you got somebody that's lookin out for ya
Men are murdered women raped
People gettin beat on videotape
And people elsewhere tryin to escape
Just to come to America to lick the plate
Helicopters scope the land
Hell is here so I hope you 'stand
Hip-hop culture is African
And rappers like me gon' rule the earth

Chorus

Verse One:

Now everyday I manifest and I generate and smoke cannabis
And I penetrate and I innovate and I demonstrate from Los Angeles
From Amsterdam to the Northern border
Panama Spain to Atlanta Georgia
Somethin' I learned that I haven't told ya
Brothers like me don't live too long

Now I know you know it ain't who you know but do you know you
See cause you could go just like any Joe and that's for sho' true
So if you're straight and you're narrow and the snake's in the barrel
And the serpent is under the rainbow
And you're head over heels instead of the reals
Then you're bound to be tangled
Cause brothers are singin' and dancin' and rappin'
Like they was a vaudeville act
But knowledge is wealth and you gotta know self
And you gotta know God's still black
Cause every so often I sit and I wonder why I even trip at all
Cause half are down when I get down
The other half wanna see me fall
Waitin around all heaven bound and you seen that your L-7's round
And when the sky falls to the ground
And you found that the only way up is down
Don't give me no additives no sedatives or preservatives
Or repetitive rhetoric you give
Just let it live
Yet my head is poundin' I'm dealin' with this load on my mind

I got a head full of headaches a heart that's full of woes man
I'm constantly singin' them downhome blues and not many peoples knows man
That leaves me with a twisted view of the whole wide world as I know it
And I guess I got no choice but to be a
I got no choice but to be
I guess I got no choice but to be a poet
I guess I got no choice but to be a prophet
I guess I got no choice but to be a griot
A gangsta
A athlete
A bum
A nobody
A criminal
A convict
A black man
A MC
A MC
A MC

Chorus

Verse Three:

Mmmhmmm
You know that's right
That's why people got to get their high so they can get high
They blast and they passed the pipe to get high
Just like a Jedi
Never said I would I
Even if I could I
Didn't do it but I just rather get a little shut eye
So I sleep from dawn to dusk in a bomb shelter
Cause ya never know
When the man is gonna drop that big one
Oh pelting, people burning melting
Alarm the farmers
Armageddon karma psychic readings
Greetings earthlings I'm from mars
Got two more planets to go and then I'm on my way to the stars
Oh no there I go through the ozone layer hole
Where the men are the men and they mean it
Down where the wind don't blow where the indo grow in the snow
And everybody po'[Intro]
Light it up! Yeah
Put it in the air (high lights, high lights)
(high lights, high lights)

[Verse 1]
Bubble kush, cat piss, purple rain
Hash plant, thai stick, white widow, wreck the train
Indo, outdo', to the brain
Orange brown redhead, green, the potent strains
Bongs, blunts, and zig-zags
Bubblers, bowls, blowin out of big bags
Twist up, roll up, pack up, hit that
Scent so strong in the air, where you get that?
Afghan, Pakistan, lamb's bread, skunk
Acapulco Goldy, hydro funk
Blueberry, chronic, chocolate chunk
Northern lights, buddha bless, Cannabis Cup
And that's what's up

(high lights, high lights)
(high lights, high lights)

[Verse 2]
The legislation wants regulation
Want to interfere with my cultivation
My personal usage for meditation
And medication to help the patients
Cancer, asthma, emphysema
Back pains, migraines, grass is greener
Glaucoma, arthritis, epileptic seizures
Medicine man make me a believer
Cheech & Chong, "Reefer Madness"
"Half Baked," _How High_ heal the masses
Light that, puff that, dump the ashes
Take 2, take 3, take 4 and pass it

(high lights, high lights)
(high lights, high lights)

[Verse 3]
Super silver, Hawaiian haze
Sativa, indica, Solomon's grave
Genesis, chapter one verse twelve ways
Marijuana, hashish, everybody blaze
Fuels and fibers, energy saved
When the natives met the travelers, guess what they gave
All praise due to the seeds they raised
And the people all over the world that smoke J's
Kings and queens, musicians, actors
Everyday, working class, stoners, slackers
Low key blazers and green bowl packers
If Mary Jane is in the house then I'm gon' mack her

[Outro]
(high lights, high lights)
This is dedicated to everybody in the world that smoke weed
Legalize it
(high lights, high lights)
Eat it, use it for fibers, Aceyalone
