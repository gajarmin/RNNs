[Intro]
My Spider senses is tingling
Feel something, got my radars up

[Verse 1]
Something going on, I feel funny can't tell me nuttin' different
My nose twitching
Intuition setting in like Steve vision
I still close my eyes, I still see visions
Still hear that voice in the back of my mind
So what I do, I still take heed, I still listen
I still paint that perfect picture
I still shine bright like a prism
My words still skipping through air
I know you can't, don't, won't get it
You niggas chose to ride that ship, sunk with it
I'm still afloat, I ain't the captain of the yacht but I'm on the boat
I ain't acting what I'm not knowing that I don't
You niggas acting like you will but I know you won't
I read between the lines of your eyes to your brows
Your handshake ain't matching your smile
Ah-ah, you niggas foul

[Hook]
I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air
I can hear it in your voice
I can feel it in the air

[Verse 2]
I sit alone in my four-cornered room staring at hammers
Ready to go bananas
Two vests on me, two techs, extra clips on me
I know my mind ain't playing tricks on me
I ain't skitz homey
Ain't no body drop a nick on me
It's like they tryna plot a set on me
I hear this voice in the back of my mind
Like mack tighten up your circle before they hurt you
Read they body language
Eighty five percent communication non-verbal
Eighty five percent swear they know you
Ten percent you know they story, man the other five
Time'll show you, just know you
Then pull they strings, you the puppet master
Fuck them other bastards
Man watch who you puffing after
Play your cards, go against all odds
Shoot for the moon, if you miss
You still amongst those stars

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Can you feel it, can you feel it floating
Without picture quoting, scriptures from Revelation
Talk shit and got the devil waiting
Body get stiff, so levitate
Why do I speak blasphemy
Knowing one day that he'll ask for me
Ask for my sins, no one'll feel his wrath for me
I go through it, so you wouldn't do it after me
As for me, I'm still circling the block before I'm parking
Not bitching, I'm just still cautious
Same black parka, same uzi, extra clips, still clapping with that same larking
Damn I feel it in the air you not sincere
Nigga it ain't an us or we or I'mma thing
It's a good/bad karma thing
This a song man of honor sing
I swear I feel something honestly

[Hook][Produced by Heavy D, Da Internz & Salaam Remi]

[Intro: Super Cat]
He's the heartbeat of the people
The ghetto people, and when I say ghetto people
The people who cannot afford to go to big concert
Some of these people do not even have TV, so they can't afford cable
Some of them can afford a radio
So the only thing they can listen to is the music
People the ghetto, people from the projects, street people
Hortical ghetto youth who know what it is to sing about suffering and reality

New York girl, dem a mad over we
New York girl, dem a mad over we
New York girl, dem a mad over we
New York girl, dem a mad over we

[Hook]
Nas the Don, Nas the Don, Nas the Don, Nas the Don
Nas the Don, Nas the Don, Nas the Don, Nas the Don
Inna New York City, inna New York City
Inna New York City, inna New York City

[Verse 1]
Smoking a escubano, guzzle my second bottle
Hope I don’t catch a homo, grossing our net
Simultaneously making me climb higher
Heinous crimes behind me, search but can't find me
Fuck sadness, had this been you having this lavish
Habitual happiness at me you wouldn’t look backwards
You would have sex on condominium roof decks
So anyone move next, I'll hit you with two Tecs
Rocking Roberto Cavalli no shirt on convertible Mazy
My Colombiana mommy riding beside me
Every tat mean something, that’s my word on my body
I’ll have to lean something with that Mossberg shotty
My niggas is ignant, put lead in your pigment
Just cause y'all was mad at all the years I was getting it
In 97 the six, 98 the Bentley
Now it’s the Ghost Phantom
And y'all can't stand em but

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Army jacket swag
Army jacket green and black
With the square top pocket that snaps
Where the gas at
Pass that, not you, you hold cracks in your asscrack
I never did that, my sock's where my stash was at
Yo, I used to listen to that Red Alert and Rap Attack
I fell in love with all that poetry I mastered that
Cutting school with Preme team, the Fat Cat was at
Future not crystal clear yet Baccarat
Now I'm the one who repping Queens
Way beyond your wildest dreams
Bottles on bottles with sparklers surround my team
That long cash get the baddest bitches out they jeans
Twenty years in this game, looking seventeen
I don’t lean: no codeine, promethazine
I just blow green, pick which bitch to bless the king
Although he’s on to another chapter
Heavy D gave this beat to Salaam for me to rap to

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
New York is like an Island, a big Rikers Island
The cops be out wilding, all I hear is sirens
It's all about surviving, same old two-step
Try to stay alive when they be out robbing
I been out rhyming since born knowledge
Like prophet Muhammad said the ink from a scholar
Worth more than the blood of a martyr
So I'mma, keep it on 'til I see a billion dollars
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
Love model chocha Mommy pop it like she 'pose to
Eyes red shot like I'm never sober
Big time smoker, Indonesian doja
Mini me's you can hold up before you end up wet up from my soldiers
Don shit, under fire I remain on some calm shit
This for every ghetto in the hood
Nas the Don, Super Cat the Don Dada, understood

[Hook]{HOOK}
My love, do you ever dream of
Candy coated raindrops?
You're the same, my candy rain

Have you ever loved someone
So much you thought you'd die?
Giving so much of yourself
It seems the only way
Tell me what you want and I
And I will give it to you
Cause you are

[HOOK]

My love, did you ever dream
That it could be so right?
I never thought that I would find
All that I need in life
All I want, all I need now, I know
I know I found it in you, I found it in you
Cause you are

[HOOKX3]

Candy coated raindrops
Candy coated raindrops

{HOOKx2}Yeah it's magic
Uhh, Jay-Z and Lenny Kravitz
And it's a Heavy D production you bastards
Come on
Ha hey yo stop playin man
This is real serious
Ha (It's the rock) yeah yo

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Let's go
Post Positano, Hov' hangin with Bono
U2 can live like Salvatore Ferragamo
And you, too, can cool out poolside at the Delano
If you, too, flow like you was out of your mind yo
Cause who knew dude that loved apple pies from McDonalds
Would soon be the boss of the Big Apple, ya know
And who knew dude that played ball for the NBA
Would make a mistake on the who knew estates, throw it away
Who knew that would be his last shot, who drew up that play
They giveth and they taketh life is cruel that way
But even a broken clock is right at least two times a day
You could have turned Guns into Roses like two times today
Now here's something you gotta say two times to Jay
I got my shades on waiting for the sun to shine my way
Got my boom box, suntan lotion waiting for action
They say when you play with skills, good luck could happen
Let's go

(C'mon) It's the Roc (repeat 4X)
That's right

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Things got too hot so I jumped off in this rap shit
You got it criss-crossed ain't no turning me backwards
Too many District Attorneys concerned with the actions
Of one individual he's criminally attached
I turned in all my rap chips I'm earning my bachelors
By dating all the models and actresses
I'm learning all the potholes in every single barrio
Trying not to mess up my axis kid
On the road to the riches through trafficking
Through rappin' and whatever's happening
Roc-a-wear I'm the young black Ralph Lauren
Every time I get out they put me right back in
The Michael Corleone of the microphone
The Michelangelo of flow I paint pictures with poems
I gather no moss like a rolling stone
In case the Grim Reaper visits my home, nigga I'm gone c'mon

(C'mon) It's the Roc (3X)
(C'mon) That's right (C'mon)

[Hook: Lenny Kravitz (repeat 2X)]
Life is all about Guns and Roses
Bittersweet like friends and foes is
Some get left behind and some get chosen
Just like life, Guns and Roses

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Tote more Guns than Roses, foes is
Visibly shook of the invisible bully (let's go)
Flowers need water to grow, it gotta rain
In order to experience joy you need pain
Every time a baby is born, somebody's slain
You know the saying, somebody's lose is another's gain
The sun comes out when the water goes down the drain
A rainbow then the clouds come out we do it again
Everything evens up, you just wait
Even a garbage can gets a steak
You ain't even a garbage can you have faith
But when it turns your way before it turns away
Gotta turn that into something you gotta learn from Jay
You'll get return in your investment if attention you pay let's go

(C'mon) It's the Roc (3X)
(C'mon) That's right (C'mon)

[Hook]

Life is all about Guns and Roses[Verse 1]
Nation to nation, all the world must come together
Face the problems that we see then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said later
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears
But we must live each day like it's the last
Go with it, go with it

[Hook]
Jam
It ain’t too much stuff
It ain’t too much
It ain’t too much for me to
Jam
It ain’t too much stuff
It ain’t, don't you
It ain’t too much for me to
Jam

[Verse 2]
The world keeps changing, rearranging minds and thoughts
Predictions fly of doom, the baby boom has come of age, we'll work it out
I told my brother don't you ask me for no favors
I'm conditioned by the system, don't you preach to me, don't scream and shout
She pray to God, to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song
Confusions contradict the self, do we know right from wrong?
I just want you to recognize me in the temple
You can't hurt me, I've found peace within myself
Go with it, go with it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Heavy D]
Jam, jam, here comes the man
Hot damn, the big boy stands moving up a hand
Makin' funky tracks with my man Michael Jackson
Smooth criminal, that's the man cause Mike's so relaxed
Mingle, mingle, jingle in the jungle
Bum rushed the door, 3 and 4's in a bundle
Execute the plan, first I cooled it like a fan
Got with Janet, then with Guy, now with Michael
Cause it aren’t too hard to

[Hook][Hook]
Black coffee, no sugar, no cream
That's the kind of girl I need down with my team
Black coffee, no sugar, no cream
That's the kind of girl I need down with my team
Black coffee, no sugar, no cream
That's the kind of girl I need down with my team
Black coffee, no sugar, no cream
It's just the way I like it

[Verse 1]
I need a girl who ain't scared to scrap
Someone who got my back
Gotta be a dark skin a light skin
Like the type of girl that stays busy all day
But when the sun goes down, she's my sexy souffle
Somebody real who ain't afraid to work it
If you try to disrespect her face around and get her feelings hurt
She ain't ? from your ? ? ? ?
She'll only flex with a brother that can handle it
And I don't care if she's a little bit jealous
She can still be a lady while she's coolin' with the fellas
An intellectual, beautiful, sexual
Hands on her hip and when she flips she's incredible
Candlelight dinners from her mack
But she's a trooper if she has to spill the beans from the can
A very nice girl but not mistaken for no softy
And that's the way I like it, yeah, my black coffee

[Hook]

Black coffee got the flip like a mitten
Roars like a lion and when I stroke her kitten
Versatile when the coke gets mine
She got a positive style ain't had none in a while
Party animal but Biggie only when she with me
And I don't have to worry cause she won't disrespect me
She's everything that a man dreams about
And when I'm with my crew she's all I talk about (hey)
Fancy here, jewels all flushed
Backside bigger than a mob but don't touch her
Prettiest girl she know the ones with the slip
A closet full of gear so you know she stay ??
Body so smooth from using plenty lotion
Perfume smelling like some old sex potion
A nice girl but not mistaken for no softy
And that's the way I want it, yeah, my black coffee

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Break it down
Black coffee, no sugar, no cream
Black coffee, no sugar, no cream
Black coffee, no sugar, no cream
Black coffee, no sugar, no cream

[Verse 3]
Black coffee, the African queen
Part of the Afro-American dream
Enough respect, I'm diggin' intellect
Appreciate the fact that you never miss a step
The backbone of the black bone here's to ya
As long as I'm around, believe me, none could ever do ya
You warm, considerate, and far from a softie
And that's why I love ya, you're my black coffee

[Hook][Hook]
That's just the way we do it
That's just the way we do it
It's J5 in the house tonight
Yes sir, damn right we're in the house tonight

[Verse 1: Akil]
It's like front and center for those who don't get it
We hit it and stay committed, the skies is the limit
Rock on and twist it, hop it, don't stop it
Drop it like it's heavy when the DJ knock it

[Verse 2: Chali 2na]
Tight swifts, so vivid, my folks is close knitted
With every note we're gon' get close to your spirit
If not post and pivot some folks just don't get it
We got a gross fetish for beats and dope lyrics

[Verse 3: Marc 7]
For real, watch my community as we stomp through your city
Destroying every and any club or academy
Rap style too plenty, baby, rain, snow or sunny
The game is nose runny, my team is your money

[Verse 4: Zaakir]
Yes, Lord, it's hard to not give us applause
Accolades and awards, they even out the odds
A little fire the bars, a flame you can't dodge
We kill 'em and play hard with with 'em 16 bars

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Akil]
We like to mash off, bogart, kill it when the track's hard
Yes, y'all, fresh, y'all, flyest shit you ever saw
A to the K, I to the L rock well
Hit the block, tip topping every jail cell

[Verse 6: Marc 7]
Push the panic button cause we like a planet comin'
Vicious avalanche or something plus I ain’t retracting nothing
Enough said, we roll with rough dreads
You old and busted, my crew we hustling

[Verse 7: Chali 2na]
Yeah, we grandslam when we can’t stand fishes
One hell of a band and my plans ambitious
We allergic to lies and to ham sandwiches
We stay flexible for if the grand plan switching

[Verse 8: Zaakir]
So if by chance you catch a glimpse
Of the West co-representative, 5 star commemorative
Rap far from primitive, inventive
Just hear it and remember it’s us, J5

[Hook]

[Verse 9: Akil]
Yo, we came to push up on ya
Southern California, top notch performer
With the corner of Roma
Run up on ya, yeah, tell it to a friend
We suck it up and blow it out in the wind

[Verse 10: Chali 2na]
And we come from the beginner, never been a pretender
Seven letters and put ‘em together, kill the competitor
Better than most, we servin’ devils for dinner
Tryna get to one of the seven levels agenda, for real

[Verse 11: Marc 7]
We set trends and never follow behind
My crew be swallowing rhymes while you following dimes
We take it to the limit, no gimmicks or false images
Style is all scrimmage, that’s why I’m all linen

[Verse 12: Zaakir]
We certified to vibe and cutting off the air supply
We kick, spit, stab and kill every vocab
The minute we go back,  the old school rhythm we shown that
Alot of cats wish to throwback

[Hook]Intro/Chorus:

Who's on the microphone? A BUNCHA NIGGAS! (repeat 3X)
I got my crew so other niggas better leave us alone

Chorus

[Third Eye]

Save yourself the trouble step back black, and don't even bother
Word to Shop and Swift they get called in like I'm your father

Chorus

[Guru]
Aiyyo, it's time for me to flow and get down with this
I'm pullin out my mic, spittin off some rounds to this
I gotta known rep, so son you better slide out
Cause when I'm flippin, I'll be rippin your pride out
So called gangsters play roles like in the movies
Oughta save that, they're way bad, you could never do me
I'm real as they come, I'll beat ya numb with my vocal tones
Words hit like aluminum bats to your dome
No charges against me cause I'm jumpin the law man

As the invincible principle Gang, is gettin bigger
Sayin peace to the Heavster rollin with a buncha niggas

Chorus

[The Notorious B.I.G.]
I bring drama like ya, spit on my momma
Cannibalistic, like that nigga Jeffrey Dahmer

Coffin sealer, ex-drug dealer, HUHHHHHH!
When I hit you with the blow of death I leave nothing left
I cook you up so quick they call me Biggie Smalls the Chef
My burner's in my left, I'm not the type to fight
I'm blowing up quick like a stick of dynamite
So call nine-one-one, Biggie's got a gun
The gat to your back, I'm smoking everyone
Quick to pack, quick to squeeze on the trigger
Who's in the house? HUHHHHHH! A buncha niggas!

Chorus

[Rob-O]
Like yo, beg your pardon, whoa
When I put one to the head nuff funk shit startin
Fine, so I headline for the public
Get mine for my rap subjects
Packed with potential, wisdom versatile elements
To quench your sense, I get down so feel the mental
Rhyme pro I'm Rob-O, the super spectacular
Brown skinned junior from Africa
Blowin up so it's, possible to freak
See the highlight, in fly writing, don't give a [fuck]
I split when it's through then it's get with the Guinness brew
And give a shoutout to my Uptown crew and still I'm wreckin

Chorus

[Heavy D]
Yo, here I go, here I go, here comes the man again gain
Ruff with a pad and pen, so run go tell your friends
It's the big belly babalu boogaloo big, boy
And I got plenty honies there's no need for no sex toy
Free me, slavery, let me go oh no no no
No longer will you treat my beautiful sisters like they're filthy hoes
Never ran from static men to crew get dramatic
And I get crazy respect from crazy crews with automatics
Now push could come to shove because they love the way I flip a skip
And that's what keeps me kinda popular with all the honeydaps
So look at me now, and tell me who is bigger?
When I'm on the block I'm with my flock and I'm rollin with a buncha niggas

Chorus

[Busta Rhymes]
Well HELLO HI! HELLO HELLO! How ya doin?!
HI! Hello hi HEY, how ya doin?! Voltronic!

Esophagus to rock it, wreckin niggas need to stop it
You get your style busted that's just what they get for comin
You want some?! Yes I know you want some of the TALENT!
But you can juice up, and em-otionally get wicked
To stick it, in your inner groove watch a nigga kick it
Ohh hah! Yo Bee, Busta Rhymes

My niggas, as we get bigger we come diesel
As masculine figures, L.O.N.S. we gettin thicker with a buncha niggas!
YESS!

Chorus 2XSeeing that your love's true
Never I'll doubt you
My heart belongs to you
That's alright with me
Worlds could end around me
So in love that I can't see
You and me were meant to be
That's alright with me

Friends come and friends may go
My friend, you're real I know
True self you have shown
You're alright with me
Through thick and thick to thin
I'll love you 'til the end
You know it's true my friend
You're alright with me

Catch a fallin' star that shines
Make a wish clap 3 times
Dreams come true it's in the mind
That's alright with me
Your wish is my command
Never thought I'd fall in love again
Again with my best friend
That's alright with me

Friends come and friends may go
My friend, you're real I know
True self you have shown
You're alright with me
Through thick and thick to thin
I'll love you till the end
You know it's true my friend
You're alright with me

Always and everlasting
This love is just not passing
We're happy as can be
Alright with me
Friends come and friends may go
My friend, you're real I know
True self you have shown
You're alright with me
Through thick and thick to thin
I'll love you till the end
You know it's true my friend
You're alright with me

[Heavy D]
Now be it thick as a milkshake
Or thin as a cornflake
I love you to death but I ain't
Pressed with a heartbreak
And anyway who cares about what
Other people talk about
I rather hear it from the horse's mouth
See I believe in, being believed in
No love life for low ties is all paper thin
But watch for the trickery
Some people are slippery
They appear making history
Disappear like a mystery
It ain't your fault
But you're a walking bank vault
The people of life make life bitter as salt
They say what they want to say
Play how they want to play
But you got to live your life day by day
In order to survive you overlook and overcome
Selfish attitude or lack of
Gratitude from the dumb
It ain't easy being you and
Everything you want to be
But whatever you do is alright with me
The bon-diddlely-dee. The overweight lover MC, the cap
The rapper hand clap, foot tap; Heavy D, dee, dee, dee[Hook]

You got it misunderstood or something
You got it confused

I'm thinking about the one night we have spent together

Call meee (Na, I don't do this. You already knew this, ma we been thru this)
Call meee (Na, I can't do that, once I done blew that. Ma, we been thru that)

Girl, that was a one night fling
You was turned on by the moonshine and the sunlight bling
You kept licking your tongue at me, knowing how quick that this young'n be
To pull out his dick from his dungarees
Besides, we had enough liquor and jungle trees
That both of us woulda got sick or had lung disease
I remember every gesture made (ooh)
During the escapade (ooh)
In the back of the Escalade (whoa)
When it come to tricks, I have some up my sleeve (uh huh)
But Shorty dived in head first and didn't come up to breathe (shit)
I usually don't get to rag em (uh)
But it's so real, I made the caddy chauffer hop out and get the magnums (uhhhh)
We getting close the Park of Meridian (uh huh)
She pulling her skirt down (uh huh)
And tucking her titties in (uh huh)
I'm walking this biddy in (uh huh)
Caressing her pretty skin
She said "I love the video that you and P. Diddy in" (yeah right)

I'm thinking about the one night we have spent together
That I'd cherish the love I thought would last forever
Call meee (Na, I don't do this. You already knew this, Ma we been thru this)
Call meee (Na, I can't do that, once I done blew that. Ma we been thru that)

This girl hobby was to slob me down (uh)
Got me walking wobbly thru the lobby lounge (ohh)
In the pent house blasting Mobb Deep and some Bobby Brown (uh huh)
Do not disturb sign probably woulda not be found (yeah)
If theres one thing I'm giving her, it gotta be back shots (uh)
She screaming like she just won the lottery jack pot (ahhh) (uh)
At the same time she jerking and wiggling (uh huh)
Smirking and giggling (ha ha ha)
Cuz I'm like Dirk when I'm digging in (uh)
The way she working and figuring
She must have be a gymnast
Cuz the positions wasn't hurting her ligaments
Ma I know you got centerfold measurement features (uh huh)
But after a nut, it was a pleasure to meet ya (uh huh)
Get ya under and outta wear (uh)
You ain't gotta go home, but you gotta get outta here
So write your number on this paper (uh)
I might wanna scrape ya (uh)
Next year when I go on TOUR

I'm thinking about the one night we have spent together
That I'd cherish the love I thought would last forever
Call meee (Na, I don't do this. You already knew this, ma we been thru this)
Call meee (Na, I can't do that, once I done blew that)

Now I ain't seen Shorty since the spot last summer
And she still calling and paging (what the fuck)
I don't even know how she got my numbers (damn)
But I been hiding (uh huh)
Cuz, this girl looking for the kid like Bush was searching for Bin Laden (damn)
Before I didn't care if she where I be (ut uh)
But now I mean it be scaring me (uh huh)
To get year of free therapy (uh huh)
She said her heart broken; it caused her to start smoking (uhhh)
And the hours of deep thinking, making her keep drinking (uhhh)
Since Hiedi started stalking me (uh huh)
I hadda get body guards to walk with me (yeah)
If you wanna get Fabolous, that's on you, that's on you (okay)
Long as you know they at on you (I said okay)
I'm looking at her ways and reactions (uh)
Hoping that this don't turn into a fatal attraction (ut uh)
She screaming "fabolous give me one more chance
Fabolous give me one more chance" PLEASE?!

I'm thinking about the one night we have spent together
(I mean, when was this ma?)
That I'd cherish the love I thought would last forever
(I never said that, I never said forever)
Call meee (Na, I don't do this. You already knew this, ma we been thru this)
Call meee (Na, I can't do that, once I done blew that. Ma we been thru that){HOOK}
My love, do you ever dream of
Candy coated raindrops?
You're the same, my candy rain

Have you ever loved someone
So much you thought you'd die?
Giving so much of yourself
It seems the only way
Tell me what you want and I
And I will give it to you
Cause you are

[HOOK]

My love, did you ever dream
That it could be so right?
I never thought that I would find
All that I need in life
All I want, all I need now, I know
I know I found it in you, I found it in you
Cause you are

[HOOKX3]

Candy coated raindrops

Ayo nasty man your ready
(Aaron) Oohhh yeaha

(Damion) You know I'm steppin
Well yo let put this together and let all the
Girls know how we wanna be done

(Heavy D)
Now would you mind if I laid you down and
Licked you lovely
Made your body sticky with some bumble bee honey
And tickled your fancy with my finger or a feather?
Worry not, my lover
The Heavster is clever
Now I'd like to hold you and squeeze you tight
But don't turn into an acrobat and flip over night
Cause we can go on if the lovin is strong
But I'd really hate to have to write a do me wrong song

Do Me Right (Repeat 4X)

(Aaron Hall)
I dream of you all the time
When I wake up there's a smile on my face
And when we get together
Girl I just don't know what to say
Why is it hello kiss goodbye
Really making me feel low
Can you tell me what is on your mind
I just got to know
What is goin on?
Can you tell me where do we go from here?
Wanna bring you close bring you in my heart
I wanna know that you're my girl
But girl you gotta treat me right

(Chorus #1 Background Vocals)
Do me right
I just wanna be your man
I want you be my girl
Why don't you just
Do me right?

(Chorus #1 Aaron)
Do me right, I wanna be your man
Bring you close to me
Why don't you do me, do me right?
Girl ya know, girl ya know, I wanna be your man

(Aaron Hall)
Such a sticky situation
But I think that we should take that chance
So many plans we've got ahead
Let's forget about the past
We can get to making love and romance
Girl you're something else
I wanna get with you, believe me girl
I wanna hold you close
Keep you in my heart
I gotta know that you're my girl
Girl, you gotta treat me right

(Repeat Chorus #1 Background Vocals 2x)

(Chorus #2 Aaron)
Oh yeah yeah
Be my girl, oh-oh
Why don't you do me, do me right?
Girl ya know, girl ya know..

(Random Girl :Who's on the phone)

(Heavy D)
Well it's caller number one
What's the matter?
Don't you recognize my voice, honey bun?
Oh, I understand
You were half sleep
Now wait a minute-
Who's beeper just beeped?
I know it ain't mine
Mine's is on my hip
Now tell me you didn't flip
On the honey dipped ya pocket trip
It's time to get ya heart broke
Honey, I smell smoke
You thought he was dope so you took a toke?
So here's the news, I'm ghost
I'm outta here, long gone
The lover went left
So honey you stay strong;
And when you wake up in the middle of the night
I'll be with her cause she
She'll do me right!
Do me right

(Bridge Background Vocals)
Do me right
Be my girl

(Repeat Chorus #1 Background Vocals 2x)

(Chorus #3 Aaron)
Do me right!
Ho-oh, yeah baby
Promise I will do the right things for you
Please baby, be my girl
I don't want nobody else
Oh I've got to have your love right now
Oh do me right
Do me right now baby
I can't wait no longer
Ho-oh-oh, do me right, baby, oh-oh-oh....[Intro (Spoken): Heavy D]
This one definitely goes out on the censorship tip, so everybody sit back, relax and have a champagne sip
We're gonna teach these people out there that we can say what we want to say, the right way
You know what I'm saying? So what we're gonna do is kick back, swing a little funky beat by my man DJ Pete Rock, producer extraordinaire. Yo Pete Rock! Make it clear

[Verse 1: Heavy D]
I can flex, bend, lend a pen to a friend
Keep a party pimping from now till then
I don't have to swear, curse or juggle
Lyrics in a verse to make a party bubble
So mister censorship, tell me what's your problem?
There's girlies on the corner, if wifey can't solve them
How does she say it? I'm curious, G
Does she say "honey love me" or "baby baby fffffun me?"
Anyway, we'll say what we want to say
Play how we want to play, feels good that way
So G. Rap, huh, it's time to kick a verse
Do your man a favor, and don't curse

[Verse 2: Kool G. Rap]
You're telling me don't curse on my verse
I did it worse, first I put a curse on every verse
I kinda got outrageous
Check it, even made a record how I'm doing all the B-I-T-C-H'es
Ducks, it wasn't for the bucks
Every word that you heard is 'cuz I didn't give a f-- aww shucks!
Hey yo, I almost forgot
The curse is a plot but it's getting kind of hot
So I'mma let profanity retire
Hey, but if worse comes to worse I'll curse you out like Richard Pryor
So Grand Puba, kick a verse
But do your man a favor, and don't curse

[Verse 3: Grand Puba]
I won't curse. I'll take a famous curse word and just say "kcuf"
Kcuf flipped around the other way means, huh?
Boy, when I do it, see I can't get stuck
Jump on the mic, then I earn a quick buck
Buck meaning loot, then I grab some boots and step with my troops
For those who can't follow and got stuck
Kcuf flipped the other way means . . . [coughing]
Is this a curse? I freaked a nurse in a hearse
But I made sure I had my hat first
(C.L. Smooth) It's time to kick a verse
God-Cypher-Divine, we can't curse

[Verse 4: C.L. Smooth]
Go ahead, ask me will I kick a curse in a verse? I'll say "nope"
Grab you by your hair, wash your mouth out with soap
Thinking to be the last one with the bad lingo
Scooping on the skins in the church playing Bingo
Sounds of the Mecca don, fresh from the tailor
Because they made a movie when he cussed like a sailor
Better yet dialect dirty like a subway
Freak a funky loop and I make it go the other way
In a vocabulary scrimmage
But cursing in my village ain't good for my image
So Big Daddy, you know it's time to kick a verse
But do your man a favor: don't curse

[Verse 5: Big Daddy Kane]
Uhh, the smooth rap inventor that enter
Parental discretion's not advised so there's no need to censor
Kids want to peep it, but you want to beep it, what?
I feel like slapping that sticker on your (Chill, chill, say butt!)
I'm too magical, rhymes are too tragical
For any source to stop Kane from getting capital
If I thought sticking me was dissing me, man, don't you know that this would be
Worse than Stephen King's Misery?
So clean all profanity, still and yet all the man'll be
Rocking any microphone you're handing me
So Heavy D, I'm about to disperse
Kick another verse, and don't forget not to curse!

[Interlude (Spoken): Heavy D]
Hey yo Big Daddy, check this out. I'm about to do some old sly, slick, smooth on the trick tip stuff
I'm gonna bring my little cousin, the producer of this joint, his name is DJ Pete Rock, definitely part of one of the family, you know what I'm saying, G?
He's about to flex on this here mic and get busy like his big cousin, you know what I'm saying? Check it
Pete Rock, kick a verse but don't curse!

[Verse 6: Pete Rock]
God bless, but I can't mess
Around with the curses, so I'mma kick verses
Or a verse, Soul Brother number 1 here to kick facts
Smoke the microphone and produce crazy tracks
Yo I'm a bad bro, let's start the flow
I'mma kick rhymes till it's time for me to go
I can't curse 'cuz Heavy D said so
Now I'mma get back to the subject, get wreck
If you think I'm bluffing just check
With the crew, Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth, very down to earth
And we didn't have to curse

[Interlude (Spoken): Q-Tip]
Yeah man, the Abstract Poet, Q-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest here to wreck!
You know what I'm saying, got my man Pete Rock and my man D in the house
And we're definitely chilling on the lifted tip
So bust the spit out

[Verse 7: Q-Tip]
Flim-flam-flim, lick my big black stuff
Must I kick a curse to be rough enough?
You can put the sticker where the sun don't shine
So back off and let me get mine!
Visions in my head when it's dealing with hits
If I have four girls, then I lick eight [its]
Wait--don't want to hear no drama
Cause the bum-diddly-Hev is a fave of my mama's
So I blew out and get mad lifted
Don't have to say [kcuf] to show that I'm gifted
God bless me 'cuz I reached my twenty-first
Hev D! Don't drop a curse

[Verse 8: Heavy D]
Peace, peace. Peace to the preacher
I'm talking about a verse without a curse, that's how I reach ya
I can rock a party without a swear or a harsh verb
Backwards, no curse words Heavy D prefers
So swing, swing to the silky clean rhythm
Before I say goodbye let me tell you how I hit 'em:
C.L., Pete Rock, G. Rap, Maxwell
Big Daddy, Q-Tip and, uh, me as well
Time to say peace, thank Pete for the beats
This funky beat was made for the streets
Notice how clean that we kept every verse
But if worse came to worse (we'd have all said a curse!)

[Outro]
Free Slick Rick! [repeated to fade-out]You Are On My Mind, You Are On My Mind

[Chorus:]
Every Little Thing I Do You're On My Mind
The Way I Feel Lately, It's Driving Me Crazy
Every Little Thing I Do You're On My Mind
I Can't Get Over You, I Think About You All The Time

Can't You See What You Do To Me
I Think About You All The Time
My Mind Is Hazy And I'm Mixed Up Feeling Crazy Over You
Let's Not Waste Anytime

[Chorus]

Round And Round I Go, Where I'll Stop Only You Know
I Guess It's All In My Mind
Take Your Time Think It Over Let Me Know
What You Wanna Do, Baby It's So Good

[Chorus]

Every Little Thing I Do You're On My Mind
You're On My Mind, Hey...

[Chorus x2: Fade][Intro]
My Spider senses is tingling
Feel something, got my radars up

[Verse 1]
Something going on, I feel funny can't tell me nuttin' different
My nose twitching
Intuition setting in like Steve vision
I still close my eyes, I still see visions
Still hear that voice in the back of my mind
So what I do, I still take heed, I still listen
I still paint that perfect picture
I still shine bright like a prism
My words still skipping through air
I know you can't, don't, won't get it
You niggas chose to ride that ship, sunk with it
I'm still afloat, I ain't the captain of the yacht but I'm on the boat
I ain't acting what I'm not knowing that I don't
You niggas acting like you will but I know you won't
I read between the lines of your eyes to your brows
Your handshake ain't matching your smile
Ah-ah, you niggas foul

[Hook]
I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air
I can hear it in your voice
I can feel it in the air

[Verse 2]
I sit alone in my four-cornered room staring at hammers
Ready to go bananas
Two vests on me, two techs, extra clips on me
I know my mind ain't playing tricks on me
I ain't skitz homey
Ain't no body drop a nick on me
It's like they tryna plot a set on me
I hear this voice in the back of my mind
Like mack tighten up your circle before they hurt you
Read they body language
Eighty five percent communication non-verbal
Eighty five percent swear they know you
Ten percent you know they story, man the other five
Time'll show you, just know you
Then pull they strings, you the puppet master
Fuck them other bastards
Man watch who you puffing after
Play your cards, go against all odds
Shoot for the moon, if you miss
You still amongst those stars

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Can you feel it, can you feel it floating
Without picture quoting, scriptures from Revelation
Talk shit and got the devil waiting
Body get stiff, so levitate
Why do I speak blasphemy
Knowing one day that he'll ask for me
Ask for my sins, no one'll feel his wrath for me
I go through it, so you wouldn't do it after me
As for me, I'm still circling the block before I'm parking
Not bitching, I'm just still cautious
Same black parka, same uzi, extra clips, still clapping with that same larking
Damn I feel it in the air you not sincere
Nigga it ain't an us or we or I'mma thing
It's a good/bad karma thing
This a song man of honor sing
I swear I feel something honestly

[Hook][Hook - Melissa Jiménez]
I can feel it in the air
(X2)

[Verse 1]

I can feel it, it's really real
It's really here
Before my inner-fear always had to interfere
Not this time, I'm never scared, here I go
I've been divine since invented, I'm a miracle
I was designed to rhyme for minds like mine
And blow like bombs over in Pakistan
I'm, that ready, and that willing
I'm going straight to the top, right thru that ceiling
And that building that I grew up in, right there
That's everything I fight for and I don't fight fair, yeah
Cause my mom had to move, we back in the city
I wanna heal my mom back but there's crack in the city
Getting stepped on, I need to step over
I looked for some help but I got looked over
They're hot headed, they gave me the cold shoulder
Damn I can't wait to say that I hate to say I told ya'
Yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 2]

Now the envy starts, people saying he ain't smart
Get the F up off my D man, this is art
I've always had drive, they still don't know how to park
I got a full ride in the game, they gotta walk
Damn, what a shame, what a shame
Please keep calm, stop hollering my name
I know seeing me rise lowers their souls
So for every inch I grow, in the ground they go
Until they're six feet cold, ground hogs
Give 'em that one, two, like a sound off
For all my soldiers at war that are ready to ride
I'm clocking in too, for that double time
I'm on my double grind, I like pockets double stuffed
Cause cash rules and I could never get enough
So can I get what, to the people thats prepared
There's a storm coming, I can feel it in the air, yeah
Yeah, there's a storm coming, I can feel it in the air

[Hook]Get fresh Hev (say what) and do the beatbox (say what)
Get fresh Hev (uh) and do the beatbox (aight)
Get fresh Hev, and do the beatbox
Get fresh Hev, and do the beatbox (no doubt!)
Get fresh Hev (check me out) and do the beatbox (check me out)
Get fresh Hev (say what) and do the beatbox (no doubt!)
Get fresh Hev, and do the beatbox!

[Heavy D]
Midnight, candlelight, hot wax drips on ya back
Dom P, empty, Cristal it's on it's way I don't play
I'm dead serious, aiyyo I mean this
Straight up ugly face in exotic places
My erotic taste is, outrageous, upstages, the bravest
Of lovers, but this one's overweight, Waterbed, now get it straight
Sade' CD, killin me softly
You know Victoria's Secrets but speak it cause you want me
DK, PJ's, BKNY is where you stay
Always lookin lovely when you walk around my way
My boo be crispy, forever jiggy, forever with me
Half Puerto Rican (ay papi) ay mami

[Hook]
Get fresh Hev, and do the beatbox (no doubt!)
Get fresh Hev, and do the beatbox (no question)
Get fresh Hev, and do the beatbox (no doubt!)
Get fresh Hev, and do the beatbox (no question)

[Heavy D]
3 A.M. creeper, crawler, official baller
Hit me on my beeper, this is word to my sneaker
This shorty's dynamite, she's a shook one from Brooklyn
But I represent the Vernon (THE VERNON?) yeah money-earnin
Now 4th Street park after dark is DANGEROUS
Might get clapped, if you look STRANGE TO US
My main objective is to check, the sex
The Rolex, the lucci, Versace Coogi Gucci
Chicks dig me (no question) chicks love me (no doubt)
They be all up in my house nigga, now what's that all about?
Here's what I like - 138, that's 69 twice in one night
Who's jiggy, Heav' Diggy, no question
My sessions in sex, leave the honies perplexed
And I don't mean no disrespect but keep it warm and get ya freak on

[Hook]

[Heavy D]
Well it's that big kid, with the gold front grin and, 600 Benz
Low pros, chrome rims, Manhattan condominium
Now I imagine scoopin dimepieces at beauty pageants
Protect your fertible, sex convertible, Lex and a Rolex
Content, on how to get jeans, I know thieves and criminals
Buff thugs who show love, backrubs from dimes and dub
Hotties with narcotic bodies, my style is urgent
A rap merchant, a major player with flavor
Well it's the H-E, you see me, A-V-Y, that be me
The dress code a pain, some things never change huh
I stay with bigness, sir jigness, who's in this
I win this hand's down I get down, for this crown

[Hook] - 2XYo, this the one right here Tone....yeah this that shit right
Here....Herb McGruff....the crime Dog, Harlem World, N.F.L......

Verse 1:
Ya'll know who holdin', get money while you dozin'
Jewels frozen, hit skins with two trojans
Harlems on the rise, the new slogan
All of these guys get blew open
Whole crew totin'
To Hell with that braggin' and boastin'
I'm'a put my mag in motion, leave all you fags floatin'
Wrapped up, don't get yourself capped up
Try and act up, watch the Four-our make you back up
Dums Dums, you know where the clique come from
Flip bricks, goin' in on sticks for Lumpsomes
Harlem World baby, up in ya girl crazy
In a tinted out V-12 pearl Mercedes
Six pusher, mackin' all these Hookers who took us
Thats my stick man, he don't say shit, keep the cooker
Beat and whoop ya, knock yo ass out cold
Pass ya gold, Teflons harass ya soul
And death become you
Clap you, take everything from you
Fuck a rumble, watch you stumble in the jungle
Hell here, hear me? nothin' like Bel-Air
Niggas sell here, mad bitches on Welfare
Fuck the Mayor, I'm tryin' to make a Million bucks a year
They wanna see me try, watch this villian duck the chair
Kingpinnin', doin' my thing, grinnin'
Stayed in the bing in prison
Ripped this cat for a ring that glistened
Pullin' off them stings like a tradition
Stay schemin' like Latin Kings up in the system
Move with wisdom, catch 'em with these duded thats gonna twist 'em
Uz' lift 'em, every nigga he knew gon' miss 'em
Gruffy, man you either hate me or you love me
Nothin' in between that, I mean that
For Greenbacks, rob niggas, sell fiends crack
Lay 'em down flat, where my Man's Two pound at?

Chorus -
Can't nobody do it better
It makes me happy countin' cheddar, yeah
Wine-n-dinin', diamonds shinin'
Pushin' Benzos with tinted windows, yeah

Verse 2:
Hold my head and polly
Lay low from Federalli's
When I squeeze shit get hot like Red Tomales
Tecks and Shotty's, hot ones catchin' bodies
Respect my robbery, Poppi you copy?
Gimme them bricks, masterminded plenty of sticks
Sip Remy with chicks, cock the Semi on dicks
Yo, these slugs ain't got no name
Watch yo' frame
I almost shot a dame who came to cop Cocaine
Squeezed on the Oye
Two-Thousand Grams of raw Yay
Took the bricks, wiped the prints off the doorway
Four-Four spray, connivin' like Keyser Soze
Flippin' pies, robbin' them Spanish guys on broadway
Crime Doggy, Cartier shines from Maury's
Dapper Don, average cat rap beyond
Strap be on, Desert storm gat be warm
What the deal is, I'm'a show you niggas what the real is

Chorus 2XYeah it's magic
Uhh, Jay-Z and Lenny Kravitz
And it's a Heavy D production you bastards
Come on
Ha hey yo stop playin man
This is real serious
Ha (It's the rock) yeah yo

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Let's go
Post Positano, Hov' hangin with Bono
U2 can live like Salvatore Ferragamo
And you, too, can cool out poolside at the Delano
If you, too, flow like you was out of your mind yo
Cause who knew dude that loved apple pies from McDonalds
Would soon be the boss of the Big Apple, ya know
And who knew dude that played ball for the NBA
Would make a mistake on the who knew estates, throw it away
Who knew that would be his last shot, who drew up that play
They giveth and they taketh life is cruel that way
But even a broken clock is right at least two times a day
You could have turned Guns into Roses like two times today
Now here's something you gotta say two times to Jay
I got my shades on waiting for the sun to shine my way
Got my boom box, suntan lotion waiting for action
They say when you play with skills, good luck could happen
Let's go

(C'mon) It's the Roc (repeat 4X)
That's right

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Things got too hot so I jumped off in this rap shit
You got it criss-crossed ain't no turning me backwards
Too many District Attorneys concerned with the actions
Of one individual he's criminally attached
I turned in all my rap chips I'm earning my bachelors
By dating all the models and actresses
I'm learning all the potholes in every single barrio
Trying not to mess up my axis kid
On the road to the riches through trafficking
Through rappin' and whatever's happening
Roc-a-wear I'm the young black Ralph Lauren
Every time I get out they put me right back in
The Michael Corleone of the microphone
The Michelangelo of flow I paint pictures with poems
I gather no moss like a rolling stone
In case the Grim Reaper visits my home, nigga I'm gone c'mon

(C'mon) It's the Roc (3X)
(C'mon) That's right (C'mon)

[Hook: Lenny Kravitz (repeat 2X)]
Life is all about Guns and Roses
Bittersweet like friends and foes is
Some get left behind and some get chosen
Just like life, Guns and Roses

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Tote more Guns than Roses, foes is
Visibly shook of the invisible bully (let's go)
Flowers need water to grow, it gotta rain
In order to experience joy you need pain
Every time a baby is born, somebody's slain
You know the saying, somebody's lose is another's gain
The sun comes out when the water goes down the drain
A rainbow then the clouds come out we do it again
Everything evens up, you just wait
Even a garbage can gets a steak
You ain't even a garbage can you have faith
But when it turns your way before it turns away
Gotta turn that into something you gotta learn from Jay
You'll get return in your investment if attention you pay let's go

(C'mon) It's the Roc (3X)
(C'mon) That's right (C'mon)

[Hook]

Life is all about Guns and RosesIntro: (interview with some lady)

"Here comes the Heavster, and I know it makes you sick"
-- Pete Rock and CL Smooth's The Basement

Uhh, yeah, here we go, what
Funk funk flow, funk funk flow, here we go
Uhh, yeah, here we go, what
Funk funk flow, funk funk flow, here we go
This one goes out to all those... heads
KnowhatI'msayin? Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan
Money-earnin Mount Vernon, can't forget the uptown
Here we go

Verse One:

Aiyyo turn me loose I don't produce with no buttercup
Premier got the butter cuts, here comes that ol rugged stuff
No room for no pitty-pat, petty kitty-kat rap
I jig em renege em or give em a dug em diggum smack
I seen you hangin on ghetto blocks, tryin to get ghetto props
You need to stop, you're just a ghetto flop
Here comes niggy-nack piggyback, knapsack sacky
Saki, classic like a Kawasaki, rough like Rocky
Sisters call me dadi Puerto Ricans call me papi
You can't stop me
Uhh, cause in these times of tough times
I'm coming with rough rhymes
Rugged beats I'm passin time on satin sheets
And where I came from, some come from
Tryin to diss the champion, numba one, Don Gargon
Talkin behind my back like they alla that, they ain't halfa that
Matter of fact, I'm the one who put the town on the map
Tick tock tick, things are getting thick
"Here comes the Heavster, and I know it makes you sick"
Yeah...funk funk flow, funk funk flow, here we go
Uhhh...yeah, well alright c'mon
Funk funk flow, funk funk flow, here we go
Yeah...yes, well alright c'mon
Funk funk flow, funk funk flow, here we go

Verse Two:

Here comes the bigger bro, I'm on the slow nigga flow
I like to do bigger show, so I can get bigger dough
I hung out in crazy states, sit down and ate crazy steaks
In the morning time I wake up with a rhyme and soem Corn Flakes
Rap is a stallion's job, hung out with italian mobs
I been around the world with pretty girls and they credit cards
Around in the Source van, got paid when my horse ran
And despite the verdict, I'm still a Mike Tyson fan
In the trench I get ruff, on the stretch, I get vexed
Eddie F's on the set who's next to get wrecked
Mr. Sweeperman, time to do the sweep up
Brothers couldn't keep up, spendin too much time with their feets up
Listen to it, this is how I do it
When I wreck a set rhymes float like fluid
Lord have mercy on those who curse me
You don't appreciate, neither-for you don't deserve me
Tick tock tick, things are getting thick
"Here comes the Heavster, and I know it makes you sick"
Yeah...what? Funk funk flow, funk funk flow, here we go
Uhhh...talk about it alright yeah
Funk funk flow, funk funk flow, here we go
Uhhh...yeah, well alright c'mon
Funk funk flow, funk funk flow, here we go

So break it down
"So easy does it on the DL, the Heavster"
(repeat 8X)

Verse Three:

Didn't it make you sick when I went pop and I kept my props
And I blew up the spot and was large on your block
I know it did that's why you formed the committee
Of a bunch of itty bitty silly Milli Vanilli hillbilly niggies
Never mind all the chitter chat, cause I got a bigger bat
Step out of line again to get your jaw tapped
Don't try to play me for cream puff
Forgot I was big stuff, rough tough, and all that stuff, huh?
You jabber jaw junkie, rap tour flunkie
Quick at the lip, but when you see me you flip like a monkey
It always amazes me, how some brother's faces be
Smilin but behind your back they talk like an enemy
But I got a sharper blade, from here I see better days
Sittin on my porch countin loot drinkin lemonade
Swingin with the shy type, girl who's the fly type
The non gettin high type, that's how you know she's my type
Tick tock tick, things are getting thick
"Here comes the Heavster, and I know it makes you sick"
(repeat until end)[Heavy D - intro]
Alright
This one goes out to all the lovers in the house, knowI'msayin?
I'm gonna express my feelings right about now
On the way I like to do things
T-R, bring it in

[Hook -sung]
Is it good to you - I like it
Is it good to you - Ooh I like it
Is it good to you - I like it
Is it good to you - Ooohooh boy

[Heavy D]
How would you feel if I worked you down?
Made your head spin like a merry-go-round
Take control like Charles In Charge
I really can't wait, let's stay in the garage
Oops, let me run as I get the whipped cream
Can't have ice cream without whipped cream
Plus an ice cube, to make you swing
My main man did it in do the right thing
C'mon let me tickle you in all the right places
Keep my eyes open while I watch ya make faces
Feelin quite dandy, comfortable and cozy
Let me draw the curtains cos my neighbours are nosey
So make a little room, here comes big daddy
Big like a truck, satisfyin like a Caddy
Many will call but the chosen are few
And all I wanna know, is it good to you?

[Hook - sung, (Heavy D)]
Is it good to you - I like it
Is it good to you - Ooh I like it (Is it good to you)
Is it good to you - I like it
Is it good to you - Ooohooh boy

[Heavy D]
Make a move, make a move, my lollipop cutie
Lay down on the cover, let the Lover do his duty
It looks like rain, but rain doesn't matter
We can take time, hold hands and chit-chatter
And what about love? Love's a possibility
But let's make sure we share the same mentality
Close the door, dim the lights
Everything is okey-dokey, cos we set it alright
And how bout oil? Warm from the heat
I can slick ya body down from your head to your feet
Make ya smile from a simple kiss
Close your eyes and I'll grant your first wish
Open your arms and wrap me tight like a teddy bear
Then take your fingers and run it thru my hair
Many will call but the chosen are few
But all I wanna know, is it good to you?

[Hook - sung, (Heavy D)]
Is it good to you - I like it
Is it good to you - Ooh I like it (Is it good to you)
Is it good to you - I like it
Is it good to you - Ooohooh boy yeah (Yeeaah, lay back a little)

[Heavy D - bridge]
You know when we kiss
I really wanna make ya feel right now
I mean, is it good to you?
Cos believe me when I tell you, it feels good to me

[Heavy D]
Check it
Roll over my lover, the sun is beaming
The hot water's runnin and the bathroom's steaming
Champagne bottle in the corner half done
Room's still bright from the morning sun
Yeah, we're snuggled up now it's time to buckle up
So call me later cutie, and I'll pick you up
Many'll call but the chosen are few
And all I wanna know, is it good to you?

[Hook - sung, (Heavy D)]
Is it good to you - I like it
Is it good to you - Ooh I like it yeah (Is it good to you)

(Tell me baby, tell me baby bout it, is it good to you?)

Is it good to you
I LIKE IT BABY[Verse 1]
Nation to nation, all the world must come together
Face the problems that we see then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said later
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears
But we must live each day like it's the last
Go with it, go with it

[Hook]

It ain’t too much stuff
It ain’t too much
It ain’t too much for me to
Jam
It ain’t too much stuff
It ain’t, don't you
It ain’t too much for me to
Jam

[Verse 2]
The world keeps changing, rearranging minds and thoughts
Predictions fly of doom, the baby boom has come of age, we'll work it out
I told my brother don't you ask me for no favors
I'm conditioned by the system, don't you preach to me, don't scream and shout
She pray to God, to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song
Confusions contradict the self, do we know right from wrong?
I just want you to recognize me in the temple
You can't hurt me, I've found peace within myself
Go with it, go with it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Heavy D]
Jam, jam, here comes the man
Hot damn, the big boy stands moving up a hand
Makin' funky tracks with my man Michael Jackson
Smooth criminal, that's the man cause Mike's so relaxed
Mingle, mingle, jingle in the jungle
Bum rushed the door, 3 and 4's in a bundle
Execute the plan, first I cooled it like a fan
Got with Janet, then with Guy, now with Michael
Cause it aren’t too hard to

Get up, party people, listen to this rap
Cause I'm about to go down and put my town on the map
MC Heavy D, delighted you'll be learnin
About the place where I rest, Moneyearnin' Mount Vernon

(Money, money, money - MONEY) (2x)

My town is really quaint, but we ain't no saints
And if you think we're pooh-puts, think again, we ain't
We're stormin strong, get taken out, never
[Name] Mob, stone cold terror
Not here to talk about that negative tip
Just makin sure you didn't make the mistake and slip
Not rappin all about the good times and chillin
But you can come and visit, homeboy, that's if you're willin
If you like it so far, you think you want more?
Come Uptown and I take you on a Heavy D tour
On Mount Vernon

Born in Jamaica, Mount Vernon I grew
But I still do my shopping on 4th Avenue
Buy my Nikes from Chambers, then walk down the block
Get the gear that I wear from Buddy's Big Men Shop
When I start to get hungry and it's time to eat
Buy a burger from Shabazz on 4th Ave./3rd Street
I'll never forget the place I got my start
Around the corner from the crib, and it's called ([Name] Park)
Now in this park I'd bang a beat on a seat
Bust a rap for the crowd that was really unique
For an eight year old kid inside the 4th grade
And when I grew they all knew that I'd get paid
And on my way up I took no shorts on the court
I played and I slayed, I learned and I taught
And shortly after that everybody was yearnin
For Hev to go down in the town of Mount Vernon

In the summertime, when the heat is hot
We can cruise on 3rd Street, but you can call it the block
Fly ladies out there in the short set suits
Nothin ugly approved cause all the girlies are cute
Would drive in my Blazer for a four-dollar fee
Written on the license plates is my name -
When it's time to chill we go to 4th Street Park
Pick up some brew from Big Lou when it gets dark
Go watch the summer league games, sip and forty and max
Cheer for the winner and watch the competiton get waxed
When that's all over it's party time
Come to the show and watch me go on a Heavy D rhyme
In Mount VernonArtist: Heavy D
Album: Peaceful Journey
Song: Now That We've Found Love

Now that we found found love
What are we gonna do with it. (x2)

One two, tell me what you got
Let me slip my quarters inside your slot to hit the jackpot
Rev me up Rev me up
My little buttercup
We can tug sheets snuggle up and get stuck
Believe it or not
Here comes the brother with glow
A strugglin', Bubblin' overweight lover hurt prone
So what's it gonna be
Me or the TV
Now let me take time to set your mind and your body free
So why don't you just stretch
Stretch for a sec
???
Shake me, Shake me
Baby Baby bake me
No need to fake here I am
Come on and take me
Wind your body
Baby move your body
I see you slip sliding
Come on now do it hottie
I'm not quite sure as to what is going down
But I'm feeling Hunky Dory
'bout this thing that I found

(CHORUS X2)

I dig the way you wiggle
You don't jiggle
Once you jiggle
So hand over your love
Cause it's heavier
Than it'll
Move like a Mover
Sye wanted to groove
So I grooved her
Then she wanted to learn
So we'd be schoolin'
So I schooled her
(Mary had a little lamb)
But not like this
We can waltz and turn
Rumble tumble and twist
Then you think you gonna give in
Phantasies relivin'
So lay down and relax
Lover my lady
Lady love of my baby girl
Spread your wings
So we can fly around the world
???
When you drop me kisses
You're so cute you drop the bomb on me
Stretch it
Stretch it
Flex it
Flex it
Gimme the permission
Okey, Dokey
I'll bless ya
Blessin' like buddha
Buddha as the bless
You can lay down on the Lover
Put your head on my chest

(CHORUS X2)

What can we do
What are we gonna do
Roses are red and Violets are blue
Love is good and plenty
If you get plenty good lovin'
???
Do me right
Do me right
My lonesome dove
Tell me one more time
What is this thing called love
I'm not quite sure
As to what is going down
But I'm feelin' Hunkey Dory
'Bout this thing that I found[Heavy D - Intro]
Here's to you...
You have gone through struggles, suffering..
This one goes out to everybody in the world, but especially on the street level
Because I know where you comin from and some of the things you do, I can understand
So through all your travels, I'm wishing you a peaceful journey

What is a friend for? Through rich and through poor
Kinda like a marriage balanced on a differnet floor
A friend could tell you things that he wouldn't tell another
So in essence, a friend could be considered a brother
You laugh and you play a lot, you talk and you say a lot
But when it's time to feel the pain, you cry and you pray a lot
I'm talkin about you, you who have the time
A time to be my friend when no one else would be mine
Problems were nothing because I had my man to share them with
Hills were nothing neither, cause I had my man to climb 'em with
I'm really proud to say that I truly really knew you good
And oh, God's blessing from the entire neighborhood
And as the days drift, drift into the future
I laugh a little louder at the times that I was witcha
This one's for you and I truly hope you hear me
And through all your travels, I'm wishing you a peaceful journey

[Hook 2X: K-Ci & Jojo] (Heavy D)
You'rrrrrrrre on my miiiiiiiiiiiind (You're on my mind)
And I wish you a peaceful journey (Peace!)
Brother I hope you hear me

[Heavy D]
In the corner, sits the little girl in tears
The shadow of a man overwhelms her fears
"Mommy, mommy, NO!", the words of a battered child
The wicked, wicked mommy has the sticks swingin buckwild
"Mister, mister, do you have a dime?
See, I'm hungry and I'd rather be a begger than do crime"
Sure - here's your dime, go make a big ten bucks
Now sneak around the corner, get your joints and go beat him up
A kid on the streets, doesn't want to be beat
So he hangs on the block 'til his pop fall asleep
Missing kids on the milk carton
A lunatic kills kids for kicks and gets pardoned
Baby girls run away from home, huh
And two months later, they're stars on child porn
Tracks on the arms of a minor
Suzie ran too, but she'll be dead when they find her
Kids on the street movin drugs, the thugs' growin up fast
Wouldn't stop when one gets plunged
Junior stole a Benz with his friends
But got caught, now he's doin time with twenties and tens
For the rest of his life, he learns to lean on the wall
And prays for the day when his number is called
This one if for you and I truly hope you heard me
Through all your travels, I'm wishing you a peaceful journey

[Hook 2X]

[Instrumental for about 19 seconds]

[Heavy D]
Pardon me, mister warden, I'm askin for a pass
To come for some of my brothers who made mistakes in the pass
It's really not their fault, you see - times are HARD
And it was probably difficult for my man to find a job
Before he was forced, forced to make a living
By lying, stealing, and eventually killing
No one was born bad, we're all God's Kids
So who's to really blame for the wrong that he did?
And speakin about the law, what are they for?
To beat us with a stick face down on the floor?
You preach and you preach that you want crime to stop
If you want crime to stop, stop hiring crooked cops
So hear me brother man, hear my plea!
If you want success all you gotta do is suc-ceed
Love, life, pain, death
What else is left on the travels of life's steps?
In life, we lose, get bumped and bruised
The road you choose not necessarily a cruise
You giggle for joy, shed a tear for pain
There's a lot to lose, and a lot to gain
Though when you walk on the streets, try to walk on street smarts
When you see your man down, try to have a little heart
This one if for you and I truly hope you heard me
Through all your travels, I'm wishing you a peaceful journey

[Hook 4X w/ ad-libs and variations]

[Heavy D]
Yeah, you're on my mind...
Peace...
Hear me now brother

Here comes the man you dig the man you dug
The man you love the man you hug
So come get some of the funky drum drum
Here I come come lights camera plenty punany action
I'm the Don in the city known for the nitty-gritty
Consider me Big Willy consider you itty-bitty

I've flirted with chicks and then I learned tricks in the ghetto mix
I went pop but I still kept my ghetto pass
And anyone who laughs kick is my yellow ass
I'm the okey dokey man the hockey pockey man
The bigger nigga with the trigger leave you smokey man
Quick to flip a chick or flyin a floppy lip
The kid never sleeps because I'm wicked off the hip
Known to keep it steady for punks who act petty
Is Vin Rock, Kay Gee, Treach big and Heavy you ain't ready
