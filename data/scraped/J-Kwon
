[Intro]
Teen drinking, is very bad
Yo, I got a fake I.D. though
Yeah
Yeah, Yeah
Yo, two step wit' me, two step wit' me

[Verse 1]
One, here comes the two to the three to the four
Everybody drunk out on the dance floor
Baby girl ass jiggle like she want more
Like she a groupie and I ain't even on tour
Maybe cause she heard that I rhyme hardcore
Or maybe cause she heard that I buy out the stores
Bottom of the ninth and a nigga gotta score
If not I gotta move on to the next whore
Here comes the three to the two, to the one
Homeboy trippin' he don't know I got a gun
When it come to pop, we do shit for fun
You ain't got one? Nigga you better run
Now I'm in the back gettin' head from a hun
While she goin' down I'm braggin' on what I done
She smokin' my blunt sayin' she ain't havin' fun
Bitch give it back now you don't get none

[Hook x4]
Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy)

[Verse 2]
Two, here comes the three to the four to the five
Now I'm lookin' at shorty right in her eyes
Couple seconds pass now I'm lookin' at her thighs
Why she tellin' me how much she hate her guy
Say she got a kid but she got her tubes tied
Girl you 21 girl that's alright
I'm wonderin' if a shake comin' wit' those fries
If so baby, can I get them super-sized?
Here comes the four to the three, to the two
She stay feelin' on my Johnson, right out the blue
Girl you super thick so I'm thinkin' thats cool
But instead of one life hat, I need two
Her eyes got big when she glanced at my jewels
Expression on her face like she ain't got a clue
Then she told me she don't run wit' the crew
You know how I do but that's just what I gotta do

[Hook x4]

[Verse 3]
Three, then comes the four to the five, to the six
Self explanatory, I ain't gotta say I'm rich
Yes single man, I ain't tryin' to get hitched
Liquor wasted on me man, son of a bitch
Brushed it off now I'm back to gettin' lit
Wit' some orange juice man, this some good 'ish
Homeboy trippin' cause I'm starin' at his chick
Now he on the sideline starin' at my click
Here comes the five to the four to the three
Hands in the air if you cats drunk as me
Club owner said, "Kwon put out those trees"
Dude I don't care I'm a P.I.M.P!

[Hook x4][Intro: Pusha T]
Hands dirty like Ason, I'm grindin' nigga you J Kwon

[Bridge]
They owe me some pape, they owe me some pape
They owe me some pape, they owe me some pape
(My mic on?)
I ain't fucking with these niggas, they owe me some pape
Hi kids, I see these wack rappers like braids all in his head
Did exactly as I did
Hi kids, I see these wack rappers like braids all in his head
Did exactly as I did

[Verse 1]
You only here cause your team pull strings like a violin
Ball, hell nah, bitch I ball like your eyelid
[?] keep pressing me, just tryna get them press release
From St. Louis where we say [?] we flip bird, no Sesame Street
On the average I'm with a bad bitch [?]
Pulled up in that black truck and we strapped up, and we extra deep
Hol' up...
Lets get some shit straight for a second
You just getting bread, Push, I've been straight for a second
Niggas say I'm dead, I say I'm too alive
Living "respect my elders" I'm 26 that nigga 35

[Interlude]
You old ass clown, just an old ass now
Let a young nigga shine
Sit your old ass down

[Hook]
All I wanna now is why they picking on me
All I wanna now is why they picking on me
Why they picking on me, stop picking on me
Cause I'll fuck around and pop your ass
Pop, pop, pop, pop your ass
They picking on me
All I wanna now is why they picking on me
Why they picking on me, stop picking on me
Cause I'll fuck around and pop your ass

[Interlude]
Five albums, a hundred songs
And you ain't got no fucking Yeezy
I bet you got some J Kwon
You ain't got no fucking Yeezy?

[Verse 2]
(Paow) I mute you
I bought a whip, color: odd future
Since -04 I had the odd fusia
Nigga time's crucial, you wanna fight? Yeah right
I turn off your light like I'm Future
Lil homie you don't know me, quit fucking with me
Fucking kids wear wigs and fucking with niggas
You The fucking Creator, is you like really creative?

[Hook]

[Outro]
Pusha T said my name, he owe me some pape (owe me some pape)
Odd Future said my name, they owe me some pape (oooooh)
And I don't fuck with [?], they owe me some pape (owe me some pape)
I ain't fucking with these niggas, they owe me some pape
Why they picking on me?
Cause I'll fuck around and pop your ass[Bow Wow]
When I was 8 I was rhymin not backyard game playin
Watchin Snoop anxiously and waitin for my chance man
Hot and cocky wit it cause I kno that I am man
I'm goin down in history like American Bandstand
I stay fresh to def like the neighborhood dope man
I stay on the top cause I keep comin wit dough man
You steady watchin stealin but there ain't no hope man
You dealin wit somethin bigger than the US Open
And ain't no jokin
Fresh like fatlaces and dukey ropes and I keep on smokin
Young but I'm ready so that means I'm strokin
Look at me now days girl a dawg is pokin
Addicted to it J.D. say I got it bad
18 nigga makin more than yo dad see
They think they doin it but I'mma out do 'em
If you know somebody like that pull up and say to 'em

[Hook: Bow Wow] + (J-Kwon)
Ye ain't ridin (ye ain't ridin)

[Verse 2]
Now every record that I make I'm tryin to get up out the store man
Every car I drive I'm tryin have you sayin whoa man
Fourth album comeback power like rogaine
Records say Columbia but I'm So So man
I stay on my grind bringin in that dough man
From records to movies now a TV show man
Anything given to me I'm gon rep man
Big house, big cars what you expect man
Just to get a glimpse girls breakin they neck man
Blinded by the light glistenin off the Breitling
Bow hot as ever I ain't lost no step
Straight t-shirt, sneakers I ain't tryin to go prep
Like these lil r 'n' b groups that need my help
Wish they had my style wish they had my rep
But oh no, you'll never have it like me man
And if you can't understand this is what I'm sayin

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I got a spot in M-I-A to get away from the cold weather
Talk around town as if I'm wit Ciara
Bow fall off nigga that'll be never
I'm rich (yea I'm rich) I can do whatever
I get a kick outta shuttin suckas down in the parkin lot
Especially when they tryin to stunt thinking they hot
All out the window talking loud like they runnin my block
That's when I come through (come through) and all that stop
And ain't another younger keep it fresh like dis man
Every year, same time come wit them hits man
Tired of makin girls fall out wit a kiss man
Well listen and you're stuck music just like quicksand
Older people say that lil young dude sick man
Young A.I. and we crew thick man
Difference between me and you is you be bricklin
And I ain't never ever done that before (no)

And a quarter bird of TrackBoy music

[Hook]
Now all my life (derty) I've been livin' (derty)

So where ya at? (derty) so where ya at? (derty)
Where they at derty? where they at derty?

[Verse 1]
This the new improved Hood Hop
I make erry mu'fucker in this bitch do the whop
Derty run his mouth 'til the album drop (why's that?)
TrackBoy beat like a freak, work a king on the block
I'm seventeen, name ain't same on the block
And beat and knock the nigga out his frame on the block
And he'll come through and let rang on the block
And all they got to say is it's a shame on the block
I'm hot HOMEBOY! don't ever get it twisted
Number's unlisted, stayed in 3rd district
For real, I'm ready to get naughty
Best of both worlds so, hey shawty!
Show me the party, and I'll show you the coke
I can show you my dick, you can show me your throat
If a nigga trip-trip then we'll show him the fo'
If his niggas run up to you, we'll show him so mo'

[Hook] - x2
Now all my life (derty) I've been livin' (derty)
And I'mma keep it (derty) until I'm gone (derty)
So where ya at? (derty) so where ya at? (derty)
Where they at derty? where they at derty?

[Verse 2]
Now I wish a nigga would run up like that
When I put that on the hood, I'mma strike back
And niggas talk shit, but I don't like that
Sayin' I don't like G, but I ain't write that
And baby mamas mad they ain't 'bout shit
Basically what I'm sayin dude, fuck a bitch
And if I had two, I'd touch a bitch
In the same breath turn around and touch ya clique
And nigga if I said then I fuckin' meant it
And nigga if it's rented I ain't fuckin' in it
TrackBoyz give me money so I fuckin' spend it
Y'all roll Sprewells but not the authentics
And fuck ya-fuck ya fo' and ya roof clown
I got shit that'll turn ya fuckin' Coupe 'round (*gun cocking*)
You ain't heard? I'm the truth now
Matter fact, hook gon' break it down
Break it down

[Hook] - x2
Now all my life (derty) I've been livin' (derty)
And I'mma keep it (derty) until I'm gone (derty)

[Verse 3]
Dogg it's a mystery..
How we drop one single, left the game now the whole world miss me
Freak this bitch like homegirl Missy
Like I'm sellin' liqour, got the whole world "Tipsy"
Sick and tired of old g's tryin' to gip me
So I put a lump in his shit, like a hickey
All I say to them is, "Dude come get me"
Watch 'em catch a crude desire, like a gypsy
Funny how I can't loc in public
Smoke in public, girl even joke in public
Got dough, so that's why I'm so republic
Cops hit the do', I start actin' so republic
I had a set, they actin' like I had a brick or more
So you got snitched on by the carni-whore
Show-Off or show ass what these guns are for
Or let the priest show her mom what these nuns are for

[Hook] - x2
Now all my life (derty) I've been livin' (derty)
And I'mma keep it (derty) until I'm gone (derty)

Ice Age in the buildin'

A lot of people said I couldn't do this, I couldn't do that
So I came back with a platinum plat, now Ice Age is on the map
Stackin' stacks, flippin' 'llacs, everything I roll black-on-black
First album sold over a mill', second album gon' double that
Ice Age we in the place, puttin' diamonds all in they face
Platinum plus and seven months, in other words I'm livin' great
I stay flossin' that candy paint, stay sippin' that purple drank
Stay grippin' that woodgrain, can't help it, it's a Texas thing
Ghea, you know like Bun B, I gotta keep it trill
I told Johnny, Paul Wall want that ice in his grill
Ghea, you know like Bun B, I gotta keep it trill

[Verse - J-Kwon]
If I had a Coupe right now, it would be on 'E'
Sometimes I feel "Unpretty" than TLC
Raise your hands motherfucker if you feel like me
Live like me and you know what's real like me
Spit for the cats who ain't got none and humble too
But damn, fuck I'm sick and humble too
It ain't over, it just feel like it crumble boo
Now since you, shit I wanna rumble too
Now if you're sick and tired, say it quick, say it proud
If you're sick and tired, say it now, say it loud
Finally got the crowd to poppin', ain't afraid of coppin'
Every reppin' St. Louis and ain't stoppin'
I'm sick and tired of this lame brain shit
Kwon gettin' money, nah Kwon gettin' fits
Say whatever you say how you say it's about me
How can this crowd be sick and tired without me?

[Hook - Big B + (J-Kwon)] - x2
You ain't gotta like me (I ain't gotta like you)

First time it's "fuck me" then nigga it's "fuck you"

[Verse - J-Kwon]
I've been bamboozled, too many times for fuckin' losin'

Keep a duece duece (Whoo!) tucked in the roof
Fuck a stash in the car, I got hash in the car
Look at ass they chick, I got ass in they jar
I'm tired of these hoes tryin' to tell Kwon to go and rob
I'm a gangsta motherfucker, fuck who you are
I told you Kwon to drink it then piss on the bar
I don't give a damn and you niggas know it (know it)
Derty you pussy and when you pussy, J-Kwon gon' show it
Guns I hold it, and you don't want to get to trippin'
One squeeze of the trigger, errbody limpin'

Cardboard niggas they too often to start, foldin'
Don't get mad at me cause a chick jaw, swollen
Cause I keep gettin' heaters (yeah)

You're click's sweeter, you don't have the time niggas
On the block, he don't never wanna battle rhyme niggas
Perceivin' me right huh? I shine like a light what?
Diamonds so bright, I brought light to the night club
Fuckin' wit Kwon, you must really like slugs
I'm the black Brad Pitt and this is the "Fight Club"

[Hook - Big B + (J-Kwon)] - x2
You ain't gotta like me (I ain't gotta like you)

SHOW-OFF![Intro]
Ya know, right now, whatever you smoke
Right now cuz they ask me, and they ask me
And they ask me, they ask me

[Verse 1]
Now they ask me
How you know so much at 17
What you mean?
You never seen a dysfuctional teen
Mama cared for me
Papa wasn't there for me
Older brother sold dope and murph blurr for me
Times got hard I had to get harder
Let me take that back I had to get smarter
16, I had me a daughter
Hold up J-Kwon lets get shit in order
Baby mama thats a whole 'nother story
Both too young both too horney
Cell phone rung, but I didn't anwser
Check my voice mail, my grandma got cancer
Now she layin' up in a old folks home
When it seamed like yesterday she was home
A month later stroke poped up
Her brain cells gone
The last thing she said was let no one steer you wrong, I'm grown

[Hook: repeat 2X]
They ask me, do I believe in God
So I ask them, did I defeat the odds

[Verse 2]
Shit fucked up but I can't turn away now
Sold dope around the town, self esteem way down
Jessie made me tougher, he boxed me up
My mama put me in the system, she locked me up
Now this around the time that we lived on hanley
When I think about it I don't know none of my family
Except, for the immediate ones
Thats why I run to the streets and the jennings hand guns
He don't talk much so everybody wanna fight him
Every school I went to nobody liked him
Never could it be right
I'd try sometimes
So I chilled by myself and cry sometimes
And all I ask from Gods to buy sometime
Would I bring his name in it If I was lyin'
Now look at what the fuck I did, done
Terry Jones last son, this is a blessing
I'm grown

[Hook]

[Bridge]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Now they ask me how you know so much at 17
What you mean
You never seen a dysfuctional teen
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, woah

Let me take that back I had to get smarter

Well listen and you're stuck music just like quick sand
Older people say that lil young dude sick man
Young A.I. and we cru thick man
Difference between me and you is you be bricklin
And I ain't never ever done that before (no)

[Hook: J.D. & J-Kwon][Intro]
Ay world, this Streets 101
I'm fin' to give you a half a pound of J-Kwon
And a quarter bird of TrackBoy music

[Hook]
Now all my life (derty) I've been livin' (derty)
And I'mma keep it (derty) until I'm gone (derty)
So where ya at? (derty) so where ya at? (derty)
Where they at derty? where they at derty?

[Verse 1]
This the new improved Hood Hop
I make erry mu'fucker in this bitch do the whop
Derty run his mouth 'til the album drop (why's that?)
TrackBoy beat like a freak, work a king on the block
I'm seventeen, name ain't same on the block
And beat and knock the nigga out his frame on the block
And he'll come through and let rang on the block
And all they got to say is it's a shame on the block
I'm hot HOMEBOY! don't ever get it twisted
Number's unlisted, stayed in 3rd district
For real, I'm ready to get naughty
Best of both worlds so, hey shawty!
Show me the party, and I'll show you the coke
I can show you my dick, you can show me your throat
If a nigga trip-trip then we'll show him the fo'
If his niggas run up to you, we'll show him so mo'

[Hook] - x2
Now all my life (derty) I've been livin' (derty)
And I'mma keep it (derty) until I'm gone (derty)
So where ya at? (derty) so where ya at? (derty)
Where they at derty? where they at derty?

[Verse 2]
Now I wish a nigga would run up like that
When I put that on the hood, I'mma strike back
And niggas talk shit, but I don't like that
Sayin' I don't like G, but I ain't write that
And baby mamas mad they ain't 'bout shit
Basically what I'm sayin dude, fuck a bitch
And if I had two, I'd touch a bitch
In the same breath turn around and touch ya clique
And nigga if I said then I fuckin' meant it
And nigga if it's rented I ain't fuckin' in it
TrackBoyz give me money so I fuckin' spend it
Y'all roll Sprewells but not the authentics
And fuck ya-fuck ya fo' and ya roof clown
I got shit that'll turn ya fuckin' Coupe 'round (*gun cocking*)
You ain't heard? I'm the truth now
Matter fact, hook gon' break it down
Break it down

[Hook] - x2
Now all my life (derty) I've been livin' (derty)
And I'mma keep it (derty) until I'm gone (derty)
So where ya at? (derty) so where ya at? (derty)
Where they at derty? where they at derty?

[Verse 3]
Dogg it's a mystery..
How we drop one single, left the game now the whole world miss me
Freak this bitch like homegirl Missy
Like I'm sellin' liqour, got the whole world "Tipsy"
Sick and tired of old g's tryin' to gip me
So I put a lump in his shit, like a hickey
All I say to them is, "Dude come get me"
Watch 'em catch a crude desire, like a gypsy
Funny how I can't loc in public
Smoke in public, girl even joke in public
Got dough, so that's why I'm so republic
Cops hit the do', I start actin' so republic
I had a set, they actin' like I had a brick or more
So you got snitched on by the carni-whore
Show-Off or show ass what these guns are for
Or let the priest show her mom what these nuns are for

[Hook] - x2
Now all my life (derty) I've been livin' (derty)
And I'mma keep it (derty) until I'm gone (derty)
So where ya at? (derty) so where ya at? (derty)
Where they at derty? where they at derty?[Intro - Murphy Lee - talking]

Ayo TrackBoyz..

From St. Louis on this one?
Come on..

[Verse - Nelly]
Girl as you came through the door, you heard it before
Errbody in this bitch better hit the floor
Your man got some money, but I bet I got more
I heard he got a Bentley, but I bet it ain't a Zoure
She braggin' bout his Cadillac, bitch I got four
She keep runnin' his mouth I might go climb in four more

[Verse - J-Kwon]
I like 'em heavily beated, conceited, you can't beat it
Bust some pussy like a cookie wit no milk I can't-can't eat it
Okay you love me? no lie, but watch it my charm bright
That don't mean that you can kick it, from grippin' my arm tight
Plus you lookin good, that-that I can't perform right
In a U.S. club, down the lot p-p-pourin' right
Jamaica born, I don't mean to toot your horn right
But ya ass super fat, w-w-was you b-born right?
And right now, I'm just chillin' with MURPH DERT!
Your girl's in the club, but feelin' on MURPH DERT!
And half of these hoes be askin' for Nelly team
I don't know where Nelly team, but I know where my ding-a-ling
Kwon the new cat, who on the scene of things
And I'm pimpin' HOOES! you really ain't seen a thing
Maybe a moon ring or maybe some jelly beans

Cause..

[Hook - J-Kwon] -x2
I.....I see some hoes in herrrrre
And I.......I see some hoes..

[Verse - Murphy Lee]
Ayo I'm Murphy Lee +The Ladies' Man+, I'm Leon Phelps the go-getter
I've been pimpin' since pimpin', even was pimpin' my babysitter (You not no pimp!)
I beg yo pardon I've been pimpin' since Kindygarten
She had the nicest boobies and remind me of Dolly Parton (Tits)
My First grade teacher bought my first set of markers
My Second grade teacher, she kind of favor Ms. Parker
Third grade: I switched schools, then my teacher was a dude
He taught me how to pimp the teachers into breakin' the rules, shoo
My Fourth grade teacher man she had a badunkadunk
If I would shot from a 'A', she would give me a couple points
Fifth grade: I exposed my first ass, Sixth grade: I skipped my first class
Seventh grade: is when I first smashed, Eight grade: I smoked my first grass
Uh, I'm not a bad dude been on more backs then tattoos
Girl's scarred to say "Hi" so they just blush and just ask you
To ask me, autograph, pictures and hugs
I see a whole lot of women on the parking lot but more in the club
What up..

[Hook - J-Kwon] -x2
I.....I see some hoes in herrrrre
And I.......I see some hoes..
In herrrrrrrrrrre

[Verse - Ali]
Now in the V.I.P. I see so many hoes its hard for a playa to make a decision
One in therre with an ass so fat I seen it with my pimp view vision (OOH!)
You ain't got no panties on, my rep name: The Panic Zone
(Ali, is you a pimp?) Till I die, and I'm standin' on
It's nothin' to a boss, you'll fuck on what it costs
I'm the type to lose at dice and rob for what I lost
God Glory Hallelujahs, you miss a call I knew ya
And what's ya name? My name Ali, I wanna stick it to ya
Now as I sit therre and check ya, ya lookin' kind of tight but you act too fly to me
Push this thing in ya mouth and right before I nut I pull it out and get ya E-Y-E
Now you know I go hard on them know, got a pimp card that I show
And a bourgeois bitch, I dump cigars on that ho
Give a model something to swallow, send her back on the runway
Day off bitch? please we gon' double up on Sunday..

[Hook - J-Kwon] [Repeat until fade out]

I got a baby mama, but I don't know her name
But really I'm a liar, and I got no game

[J-Kwon]
Well, six hundred on my benz, but I got no gas
Back seat full of chicks, girl put it on glass
One record blue, my record sales cool
My momma said, "boy you should'a kept yo ass at school" (yo, ya momma's right)

[Andy]
That's what you get, for thinkin you da shit
Man forget bout these chicks, we in the club, eatin grits
That's how we do it, sippin on some sizzurp
Roll up to the club, with my rims on the cizzurb

[J-Kwon]

From St. Louis where we say [?] we flip bird, no Sesame Street
On the average I'm with a bad bitch [?]
Pulled up in that black truck and we strapped up, and we extra deep
Hol' up...

[Interlude]
You old ass clown, just an old ass now
Let a young nigga shine
Sit your old ass down

[Hook]
All I wanna now is why they picking on me

[Verse 1 - J-Kwon]
A here comes the B to the C to the D
No cat out the Lou gangsta as me
Y'all hit two, I'm just goin for three
Bottle full of Cris, but I still rock a tee
And you got a little fat denim, from the streets
Drink so much that it fucked up my tee
People wasn't drunk, so why they wanna be
Cause you get eleven thousand spins in a week
Here comes the C to the B to the A
Never fall off like B2K
Wanna get tipsy, you one drink away
Why would I buy when it's better when you pay
Track Boys from the Lou, Jermaine from the A
But they got the boy gettin tipsy with Sway
Then she said she had somethin to say
"One hit wonder" please I'm here to stay!

[Hook - J-Kwon]
Now e'rybody, e'rybody, e'rybody, e'rybody

[Verse 2 - Chingy]
Stop! I pulled up to the club already filthy
She say she don't give head, she innocent til proven guilty
Walkin VIP, cats screamin "GIB!"
Skull cap with a bib on the back DTP
This girl starin so I put a spell on her like a gypsy
We bought up the bar with hundreds some drunk not tipsy
Don't trip cause the whole St. Louis is ridin with me
Cats start hatin, tell them people come get me
Yeah! here comes the king of the Midwest C
H to the I to the N to the G (Y)
My homies in the back puffin on some ooo wee

The Git It Boys hurr, they gon retch and boozee
Let's take it from the club to the ja-cuzzi

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Murphy Lee]
Ayo one I am the dude that the people call Murph (Murph)

Three roll joints, smoke one when I get home (home)
Four real dirty you and I versale (sale)
Those the people I thank, when my damn record sales (sale)
Five new problems and one ain't broke (broke)
White Porsche truck wood grain like Coke
Now e'rybody in the club lookin spiffy
Mama got on a dress, boots from the sixties
Oh girl pissy, Shantay tipsy
Kim, Kesha, and Pam all leavin wit me

E'rybody in the club gettin tipsy
E'rybody in the club gettin tipsy
E'rybody in the club gettin tipsy
E'rybody in the club gettin tipsy[Intro]
Ya know, right now, whatever you smoke
Right now cuz they ask me, and they ask me
And they ask me, they ask me

[Verse 1]
Now they ask me
How you know so much at 17
What you mean?
You never seen a dysfuctional teen
Mama cared for me
Papa wasn't there for me
Older brother sold dope and murph blurr for me
Times got hard I had to get harder
Let me take that back I had to get smarter
16, I had me a daughter
Hold up J-Kwon lets get shit in order
Baby mama thats a whole 'nother story
Both too young both too horney
Cell phone rung, but I didn't anwser
Check my voice mail, my grandma got cancer
Now she layin' up in a old folks home
When it seamed like yesterday she was home
A month later stroke poped up
Her brain cells gone
The last thing she said was let no one steer you wrong, I'm grown

[Hook: repeat 2X]
They ask me, do I believe in God
So I ask them, did I defeat the odds

[Verse 2]
Shit fucked up but I can't turn away now
Sold dope around the town, self esteem way down
Jessie made me tougher, he boxed me up
My mama put me in the system, she locked me up
Now this around the time that we lived on hanley
When I think about it I don't know none of my family
Except, for the immediate ones
Thats why I run to the streets and the jennings hand guns
He don't talk much so everybody wanna fight him
Every school I went to nobody liked him
Never could it be right
I'd try sometimes
So I chilled by myself and cry sometimes
And all I ask from Gods to buy sometime
Would I bring his name in it If I was lyin'
Now look at what the fuck I did, done
Terry Jones last son, this is a blessing
I'm grown

[Hook]

[Bridge]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Now they ask me how you know so much at 17
What you mean
You never seen a dysfuctional teen
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, woah
Times got har I had to get harder
Let me take that back I had to get smarter

[Hook][Intro]
Teen drinking, is very bad
Yo, I got a fake I.D. though
Yeah
Yeah, Yeah
Yo, two step wit' me, two step wit' me

[Verse 1]
One, here comes the two to the three to the four
Everybody drunk out on the dance floor
Baby girl ass jiggle like she want more
Like she a groupie and I ain't even on tour
Maybe cause she heard that I rhyme hardcore
Or maybe cause she heard that I buy out the stores
Bottom of the ninth and a nigga gotta score
If not I gotta move on to the next whore
Here comes the three to the two, to the one
Homeboy trippin' he don't know I got a gun
When it come to pop, we do shit for fun
You ain't got one? Nigga you better run
Now I'm in the back gettin' head from a hun
While she goin' down I'm braggin' on what I done
She smokin' my blunt sayin' she ain't havin' fun
Bitch give it back now you don't get none

[Hook x4]
Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy)

[Verse 2]
Two, here comes the three to the four to the five
Now I'm lookin' at shorty right in her eyes
Couple seconds pass now I'm lookin' at her thighs
Why she tellin' me how much she hate her guy
Say she got a kid but she got her tubes tied
Girl you 21 girl that's alright
I'm wonderin' if a shake comin' wit' those fries
If so baby, can I get them super-sized?
Here comes the four to the three, to the two
She stay feelin' on my Johnson, right out the blue
Girl you super thick so I'm thinkin' thats cool
But instead of one life hat, I need two
Her eyes got big when she glanced at my jewels
Expression on her face like she ain't got a clue
Then she told me she don't run wit' the crew
You know how I do but that's just what I gotta do

[Hook x4]

[Verse 3]
Three, then comes the four to the five, to the six
Self explanatory, I ain't gotta say I'm rich
Yes single man, I ain't tryin' to get hitched
Liquor wasted on me man, son of a bitch
Brushed it off now I'm back to gettin' lit
Wit' some orange juice man, this some good 'ish
Homeboy trippin' cause I'm starin' at his chick
Now he on the sideline starin' at my click
Here comes the five to the four to the three
Hands in the air if you cats drunk as me
Club owner said, "Kwon put out those trees"
Dude I don't care I'm a P.I.M.P!

[Hook x4][Intro - J-Kwon - talking]
I'm gettin' sick and tired (yeah)
I'm gettin' sick and tired
Very sick and tired..homie (homie)

[Verse - J-Kwon]
If I had a Coupe right now, it would be on 'E'
Sometimes I feel "Unpretty" than TLC
Raise your hands motherfucker if you feel like me
Live like me and you know what's real like me
Spit for the cats who ain't got none and humble too
But damn, fuck I'm sick and humble too
It ain't over, it just feel like it crumble boo
Now since you, shit I wanna rumble too
Now if you're sick and tired, say it quick, say it proud
If you're sick and tired, say it now, say it loud
Finally got the crowd to poppin', ain't afraid of coppin'
Every reppin' St. Louis and ain't stoppin'
I'm sick and tired of this lame brain shit
Kwon gettin' money, nah Kwon gettin' fits
Say whatever you say how you say it's about me
How can this crowd be sick and tired without me?

[Hook - Big B + (J-Kwon)] - x2
You ain't gotta like me (I ain't gotta like you)
And I ain't gotta like you (You ain't gotta like me)

First time it's "fuck me" then nigga it's "fuck you"

[Verse - J-Kwon]

You tryin to hold ya little clothes on and have to get greezy wit ya for you to take 'em off
You might as well take ya belt off cuz ya pants fallin down anyway
And when I say I'm wit the Trackboyz

Heavy spark, now the dirt lyin' on him
Oops my bad, found out they was lyin' on him (oh well)

I mean, I just need to talk to you right now
Yeah, yeah, where I begin
Right, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Sunny day, age 14
When I first saw you, you was lickin a ice cream
Knew you had freak in ya blood from the get go
Yo' you showed a nigga some love from the get go
Cute too, so you ain't get caught in the image
Friends got in I shouldn't of tossed out our business
So religious, yeah
In other words, sorry couldn't explain the way I was feelin
Back to the story - 'member when we used to hit concerts
Mainly legit and Nore's
Tryin to get on that was exciting for me
And exciting for you that was something to see
Plus you had ass and I loved that
Back in this I was ya boyfriend I rubbed that
Tryin to get on, girl I accheived that
Everybody hands out from you I recieved that

[Hook- Sadiyyah]
Don't need no ice and no billie
I just wanna have you here wit me
I'm there for you, always be true
It's just you and me, you and me (I can't promise that)
You don't have to go doubble platinum
I'll be there and I'm always goin' back em'
I'm there for you, always be true
It's just you and me you and me (I can't promise that)

[Verse 2]
So I know just because
How you said them words it had to be love
Basically it had to be us
Against the world not giving two fucks
But know soon as shit picked up
I start actin different so you switched up
I don't blame you, but I blame us
Kept shit smooth even when it got rough
But, I don't see that no more
Got one half our wait hope he sore
What the fuck is hopin' for
When I can't be the man I used to be no more
No time, we don't go out to eat no more
Barely home, you don't see me before you sleep no more
You love me, and I know you ain't playin
Cuz the first week gone, you callin' me sayin'

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Business got good, but we got bad
Money got happy, but we got sad
But in the midst we had a daughter
Evern though we floatin' clear like ocean water
Came home two bags of Fendi
It was gone that started to offend me
Child support hit, that really offend me
Puffy was right it's all about the benjie's
Bitter now cuz the loves still in me
In my boxers on couch, sippin' Remy
Thinkin' that she need to be killed like Kennedy
Then I listen to I got the remedy
After all I still give you what you need, cuz we got a daughter to feed
Though you supposed to be here at least you sold me that
Why the fuck did I listen when you told me that stupid

[Hook 2x]

[J-Kwon talkin over music]
You know, you feal my story
Write me or something ya know what I'm sayin
Or I'll be in a town near you or, or
Your town or whatever ya know
Come see me and come tell me that ya know
It's been a long time traveling
Though you was supposed to be here
So uh, ya family can't say I'm wrong[Hook: Jermaine Dupri]
They my enemies
Dressed in my friend's clothes
Dick ridin' , thinking I don't know
They my enemies
Dressed in my friend's clothes
Smile in my face but pop shit behind doors
I wake up, knowing I'm bout to see 'em all in my face
Like what up, these motherfuckers all over the place
I'm fed up, homie I'm angry and I need me my space
And good luck, quit all that thinkin' you gon' take my place

[Verse 1: Jermaine Dupri]
It's a lotta niggas in this club poppin bub that's phony
Acting like they got nothin but love for the homie
Straight 2-faced, they like them niggas at Sony
(J-Kwon: Now ain't you the mayor?) I'm the one and only
For the longest, me and my niggas been hittin this town like a storm
And now you gotta see me and Penny arm to arm
One day you'll get it, keep tryin nigga
Yeah right you ballin, keep lyin nigga
I know a lot of ballas, half of 'em hatin' me
Bankrupt but you must ain't seen my mobs lately
Be damned if you like me, give a fuck what you rate me
I only know 2 words and nigga that's "Pay me"
Now we finna stop talkin shit about JD
Cause he been doin this shit since y'all was babies
How you gon, try to degrade me?
Y'all ain't my friends, nigga I ain't crazy

[Hook]

[Verse 2: J-Kwon]
Now I'm-a chik-i-chill til the moment I lose mine
And when I lose mine, gun stores gon lose lines
I thought you knew, Kwon keep 8 on the waistline
I'm from the Lou, Kwon flip 8's to waste time
I spit it, for niggas who don't feel my shit
She a whore, I don't like her you can deal my bitch
You wanna war?, what for?, I peel this bitch
Body liftin, done with it, I don't need this shit
You my enemy
Dressed in my friend's clothes
But when I shoot I do better than Shaq doin free throws
A buncha niggas trippin', they got the game wrong
A buncha niggas feelin' like me who bumpin' the same song
I'm evil, why you thinking you gon' take my spot?
Wait til my album drop, quit thinking you 'Pac
And you rappin hardcore when you knowin' you pop
And you sayin you a 'rilla when you knowin' you not

[Hook](feat. St. Lunatics)

(Intro - Murphy Lee - talking)
I-I-I-I-I-I see some hoes..

(J-Kwon - talking)
Ayo TrackBoyz..

From St. Louis on this one?
Come on..

(Verso - Nelly)
Girl as you came through the door, you heard it before
Errbody in this bitch better hit the floor
Your man got some money, but I bet I got more
I heard he got a Bentley, but I bet it ain't a Zoure
She braggin' bout his Cadillac, bitch I got four
She keep runnin' his mouth I might go climb in four more

(Verso - J-Kwon)
I like 'em heavily beated, conceited, you can't beat it
Bust some pussy like a cookie wit no milk I can't-can't eat it
Okay you love me? no lie, but watch it my charm bright
That don't mean that you can kick it, from grippin' my arm tight
Plus you lookin good, that-that I can't perform right
In a U.S. club, down the lot p-p-pourin' right
Jamaica born, I don't mean to toot your horn right
But ya ass super fat, w-w-was you b-born right?
And right now, I'm just chillin' with MURPH DERT!
Your girl's in the club, but feelin' on MURPH DERT!
And half of these hoes be askin' for Nelly team
I don't know where Nelly team, but I know where my ding-a-ling
Kwon the new cat, who on the scene of things
And I'm pimpin' HOOES! you really ain't seen a thing
Maybe a moon ring or maybe some jelly beans

Cause..

(Hook: - J-Kwon x2)
I.....I see some hoes in herrrrre
And I.......I see some hoes..
In herrrrrrrrrrre

(Verso - Murphy Lee)
Ayo I'm Murphy Lee +The Ladies' Man+, I'm Leon Phelps the go-getter
I've been pimpin' since pimpin', even was pimpin' my babysitter (You not no pimp!)
I beg yo pardon I've been pimpin' since Kindygarten
She had the nicest boobies and remind me of Dolly Parton (Tits)
My First grade teacher bought my first set of markers
My Second grade teacher, she kind of favor Ms. Parker
Third grade: I switched schools, then my teacher was a dude
He taught me how to pimp the teachers into breakin' the rules, shoo
My Fourth grade teacher man she had a badunkadunk
If I would shot from a 'A', she would give me a couple points
Fifth grade: I exposed my first ass, Sixth grade: I skipped my first class
Seventh grade: is when I first smashed, Eight grade: I smoked my first grass
Uh, I'm not a bad dude been on more backs then tattoos
Girl's scarred to say "Hi" so they just blush and just ask you
To ask me, autograph, pictures and hugs
I see a whole lot of women on the parking lot but more in the club
What up..

(Hook: - J-Kwon x2)
I.....I see some hoes in herrrrre
And I.......I see some hoes..
In herrrrrrrrrrre

(Verso - Ali)
Now in the V.I.P. I see so many hoes its hard for a playa to make a decision
One in therre with an ass so fat I seen it with my pimp view vision (OOH!)
You ain't got no panties on, my rep name: The Panic Zone
(Ali, is you a pimp?) Till I die, and I'm standin' on
It's nothin' to a boss, you'll fuck on what it costs
I'm the type to lose at dice and rob for what I lost
God Glory Hallelujahs, you miss a call I knew ya
And what's ya name? My name Ali, I wanna stick it to ya
Now as I sit therre and check ya, ya lookin' kind of tight but you act too fly to me
Push this thing in ya mouth and right before I nut I pull it out and get ya E-Y-E
Now you know I go hard on them know, got a pimp card that I show
And a bourgeois bitch, I dump cigars on that ho
Give a model something to swallow, send her back on the runway
Day off bitch? please we gon' double up on Sunday..

(Hook: - J-Kwon)
((x2) until fade out)
I.....I see some hoes in herrrrre
And I.......I see some hoes..
In herrrrrrrrrrre[Intro]
Father, forgive me for I have sinned
You know, we all fall short in the glory of God ya know
But uh, true life is just so hard you know
Espically when you tryin to find a way out
All I need is a sign
Lord, just give me a sign
Can you just, just show me a sign Lord

[Verse 1]
Dig it I dug it, some hate it some love it
Politic in the game, I'm just a puppet for the public
If I, spit it you can quote it
If you, read it then I wrote it
Knew it's dirty in this bitch yall let me in it so I sold it
Niggas pussy (Why?)
Cuz they givin they clothes up
Sayin that they pimpin' but really givin they hoes up
Am I sick, exactly, from takin care of the family
Carry a scar on my nose, that came from my granny
A major player in this game, knew it since day one
Lookin for shit to be the same, nigga keep waitin
I done done, all I can do for the streets
Humble now I'm waitin to see what the streets do for me
Got a child, so I'm like payin support
Still a child, now who the hell payin support
I can slang and bang on St. Louis streets
Better yet keep it grimey till I'm 6 feet deep, come on

[Hook]
We love gettin high to the morning light
We gettin high till the morning light
Gettin high till the morning light
We gettin high like da da da
Gettin high like da da da

[Bridge]
Forgive me father I have sinned on this one
Hail Mary ten times but this ain't the last one
[2x]

[Verse 2]
Feelin strange, cuz deaths upon me
Damn I should of knew man was not gone warn me
Still rappin, while watchin my papers stackin
Tryin to leave coke alone but the streets callin me back in
And I ain't actin, watchin homie subtracting
Check the murder rate I ain't lyin thats a fact and
I'm from a city where they want they corners back
Body bag, toe tag if you don't know how to act
Picture that, niggas straight scrambling for crack
Baby mamas keep up drama but I love where I'm at
If you ain't never been to the Lou this here lyrical too
And if you thinkin bout comin then you best be true come on

You hatin' because of hatas I invented this song
Mother...oh I supposed to keep going?
Idiot, we all know the album droppin'

Dude, they can hit ya daughter like me
Just bought a gun, it's a new artist like me
Rare? forget ya the minute you step wrong
Fall down on the ground, you hear the step song
You wanna bang? we ain't even gotta fight
If we do, watch how quick it be like

MOTHERFUCK THIS! MOTHERFUCK THAT!

HRRR, HRRR, HRRR, HRRR
HRRR, HRRR, HRRR, HRRR
HRRR, HRRR, HRRR, HRRR[Ebony Eyez Talking]
Ayo...Tar... you ready?

[Tarboy from Trackboys Talking]
Yeah..uh

[Ebony Eyez]
Let's Do This..

[Chorus - Tarboy]
Look..uh..
Money ain't never move me...
Dawg, this ain't a movie
This is real life, so why you tryin' to do me?
Sit back and relax and think about the past
And make your next move your best, it might be your last

[Chorus - Ebony Eyez]
Look..
Money ain't never move me..
Bitch this ain't a movie
This is real life, so why you tryin' to do me?
Sit back and relax and think about the past
And make your next move your best, it might be your last

[Verse 1: Tarboy]
Look...
Money don't make the man
But still, I understand
If you ain't gettin' dough, what the fuck you in this for?
I see you chasin hoes, and all your fancy clothes
You say you hate the music, then why you at the show?
What all that yappin' mean?
How the fuck that fit the plan?
Where the fuck you from homeboy?
You ain't from my land
I see you in the club, in the corner mean-mugged
With all your little thugs, go pop a bottle of bub
And think about it first
And drink away your problems
Before a nigga out here on the streets help you solve them
See, I ain't mad at ya
I'm just tryin' to relax you
And teach you somethin' homie, before them killers snatch you
I try to keep it thorough
Keith done been around the world
And never understood how a man could act like a girl
But see I'm just a squirrel
And this is your world
And I wish you the best
So get it off your chest

[Chorus - Tarboy]

[Chorus - Ebony Eyez]

[Verse 2 - Ebony Eyez]
Louie, done made my purse
Well, he ain't write this verse
Some people put they money first, and don't care who they hurt
Always talkin' bout how they: finna do this and finna do that
Finna get that new benz and finna buy they girl a cadillac
I try to mind my business, they strike at me with a vengence
Don't know I'm young and visicious and know how to throw them fist-es
Say I dont keep it real, (what?) say I ain't got the skill
(we) mad cause I got a deal, give a fuck bout how you feel
I represent the streets and that's the way you gotta be
And when my album drop, some people gon' be mad at me
Bitches don't wanna listen, don't wanna play position
Ain't got a pot to piss in, but they call they self dissin'
Your next move should always be your best move
Never follow what the rest do, and they'll respect you
Cause money come and go, don't front like you don't know
And when it's all spend up and gone, you ain't got shit to show

[Chorus - Tarboy]

[Chorus - Ebony Eyez]

[Verse 3: J-Kwon]
Now my baby mama hate the fact, now that I'm gettin' scratch
So she go and react, hold up man, matter of a fact
Now that I'm thinkin' back, when I ain't had no scratch
No ice, or no 'lac, hold up Kwon rewind it back
Now was you gon' react?
That's when I hate the fact, I laid her on her back
(hold up man, don't say that)
Nah, let me spit the facts
Y'all know I love my son, but she only care about if he got some air force ones
Now ain't that shit dumb?  Now where we both come from
Like all your life, you grew up running around spending funds
We was broke as Hammer, t-shirts for pajamas
Cribs small as llamas, eating corn flakes and bananas
Now it's vests and Hummers, we fucked the whole summer
The only reason, cause your man be tryin to take me under
So now I sit and wonder, like I ain't got no clue
And yes it's true, that the money might have moved you

[Chorus - Tarboy]

[Chorus - Ebony Eyez](*whispering*)

Call me, I'm the man
You need a hand boo I got a couple hundred grand
Dayton's on ya feet, diamonds in ya piece
And I like the way ya ass move to the beat
You a freak, that's summin you can be
Keep playin' wit me, then I gotta hit ya peeps
The girls love me, cause I'm from the streets
In the bed, I'm goin' thirty at least
Show-Offs on the cap, plus her ass fat
It's so big she gon' let me hit it from the back
Not knowin' she a rat, she suckin' on my tat
I gotta rub her, so there's nuthin' wrong with that
The weed hold that, the blunt roll that
And when you give me head, please don't hold back
Where your eyes at? lickin' the Kodak
And when I'm finished, then you comin' it's yo pack
Now..

[Hook - J-Kwon] - x2
Show your ass, gon' hit the flo'
Show your ass, gon' hit the flo'
Show your ass, gon' hit the flo'
Show your ass, gon' hit the flo'

[Verse - Eboni Eyes]
I hops out the Jag, pocket full of cash
Wish your ho would try to jump like she bad
Jeans fittin' tight, weave fittin' right
The way I feel my ass make the ballers blow they cash
Step up in the party, sippin' the Bacardi
Betta watch your man cause I'm feelin' kinda naughty
I'm lookin' to my left, over to my right
I head to the flo', time to get this bitch hype
Niggas in the place, all up in my face
Somebody touch my ass I might have to catch a case
Don't let the face fool ya, I'll give it to ya
Peel a right hand jab like Zab Jooda
I say what I mean, mean what I say
You wanna fuck wit' me, you gotta pay like you weigh
No shame in my game, if you cannot hang
Get the fuck up out my face and let me do my thang

[Hook - J-Kwon] - x2
Show your ass, gon' hit the flo'
Show your ass, gon' hit the flo'
Show your ass, gon' hit the flo'
Show your ass, gon' hit the flo'

[Verse - J-Kwon]
Gon' hit the flo'...gon' hit the flo'
Well I hops out the 'Lac, diamond in the back
You can tell by the way I made "Tipsy", I'm a mack
Show-Off in fad, Show-Off the fact
Give me a Coupe and several hoes, I'll brag
Yeah I got a grammar, some say it's country
But the truth is none of y'all gettin' money
I tried to stay humble, but her ass rumble
Give her the ball, guaranteed she gon' fumble

[Verse - Eboni Eyes]
Skin tight denim, fat ass in 'em
I can tell by the way he lookin' at me I can pimp him
This nigga herre lame, he got no game
His shoes ran over wit' a fake ass chain
Never big spenders, on my agenda
Get him to surrender, colder than December
I'm rockin' my stilettos, box of Ameretto's
Before the night is over I'ma probably have to check hoes

[Hook - J-Kwon] - x2
Show your ass, gon' hit the flo'
Show your ass, gon' hit the flo'
Show your ass, gon' hit the flo'
Show your ass, gon' hit the flo'

[J-Kwon] (repeat until fade)
Show your ass[Intro:]
Teen drinking is very bad
Yo I got a fake ID though
Yeeah, yeeah, yeeah, yo, 2 step with me, 2 step with me

[Verse 1:]
1, here comes the 2 to the 3 to the 4
Everybody drunk out on the dance floor
Baby girl ass jiggle like she want more
Like she a groupie and I ain't even on tour
Maybe cause she heard that I rhyme hardcore
Or maybe cause she heard that I buy out the stores
Bottom of the 9th and a nigga gotta score
If not I gotta move on to the next whore
Here comes the 3 to the 2 to the 1
Homeboy trippin' he don't know I got a gun
When it come to poppin we do shit for fun
You ain't got one nigga you betta run
Now I'm in the back gettin head from my hunz
While she goin down I'm breakin down what I done
She smokin my blunt sayin she ain't havin fun
Bitch give it back now you don't get none

[Chorus x4:]
Now everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy
Everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy

[Verse 2:]
2, here comes the 3 to the 4 to the 5
Now I'm lookin at shorty right in the eyes
Couple seconds passed now I'm lookin at her thighs
While she tellin me how much she hate her guy
Said she got a kid but she got her tubes tied
If you 21 girl that's alright
I wonder if a shake comin with them fries
If so baby can I get em super sized
Here comes the 4 to the 3 to the 2
She started feelin on my johnson right out the blue
Girl you super thick so I'm thinkin that's cool
But instead of 1 lifestyle I need 2
Her eyes got big when she glanced at my jewels
Expression on her face like she ain't got a clue
Then she told me she don't run with a crew
You know how I do but I guess one gotta do

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
3, here comes the 4 to the 5 to the 6
Self explanatory I ain't gotta say I'm rich
This single man ain't tryna get hitched
Liquor wasted on me man son of a bitch
Brushed it all off now I'm back to gettin lit
Goose and orange juice man this some good ish 
Homeboy trippin cause I'm starin at his chick
Now he on the sideline starin at my clique
Here comes the 5 to the 4 to the 3
Hands in the air if you cats drunk as me
Club on the set Kwon cut out them trees
Dude I don't care I'm a P.I.M.P

[Chorus]
Everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy [x4]
