[Hook: Melonie Fiona and Wale]
Babe you know it gets no better than this
It's like sunshine on a rainy day
It's like a high, could you take me away?
Take me away away
It's a beautiful bliss
When you feel like this
When you spill out hits
When you fly as a bitch
And you ride with this
And you ain't bothered a bit now, baby

[Verse 1 - Wale]
Fresh out the airport
Fresh out the chair with the clippers
Like Shaun living, thinking hmm
I'm trying to get it like Sean get it
If lord giveth a mill and a milf light skinneded
It's slight blemishes and life system
But I'm giving it foundation when I write lyric
That anvil Neidhart minus bright knickers
Maybe not quite the star but my heart's in it
When Bret Hart meet Brett Farve
A sharp shooter well exceeding any figure four
You see my figure more or less six or more
I invest in my larynx and lungs and this voice I project
My project is like what pros inject
And a nigga so fly I should be droved in jets
It's ironic they call me a fresh breath no joke
You see dem boys sign me to the scope right

[Hook]

[Verse 2: J.Cole]
I phone home to the real they wanna know just how it feel
Who woulda thought a lil nigga from the Ville could get a deal
And tell dem niggas at the top we want yo spot we are for real
And, yeah, we heard you got it locked but like dem socks we on your heels
So you best be on your toes, nigga
Especially on your flows, nigga
Cause man they keep on checking for me especially all your hoes, nigga
Catch me on your doorstep you see me let me in
All I wanna do is eat I'm like the freaky lesbian
Now all I wanna do is ball on TV need E-S-P-N
They heard I'm bout to blow, so all my enemies say let's be friends
And all these rappers know just where I'm bout to go so catch me then
And all the girls we knew that screamed fuck you going let me then
I'm definitely in a class of my own, at dinner with Hov
Hoping that he pass the baton, he just pass the Patron
Ain't nothing given, dog, it's earned if you just living, dog, you learn
I let you niggas see the light I'm like the prison yard, I yearn
For that living large, but mama I ain't done yet
Sit back and watch your sunrise
Kick back and know yo son set
Forever I ain't run yet and I never will
Nas told me life's a bitch
Pac said fuck the world and I ain't come yet
You up yet
My punchlines like gut checks I'm raw-dog
I'm rough sex
I'm on deck I'm up next
I'm godbless, I'm success so fuck stress
You can get the fuck from around me
And if you listening know you wondering
Where the fuck they found me
I'm from the Ville, boy

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Wale]
Another day up in my ES
Wish it was an LS
But elastic is my wallet, fuck it
I don’t be stressed like relaxed muscles
Your feedback ain't flexing
And you can keep it running like a muffler
When we not in summer
They like A-list actors they not no stunners
Too much practice now for me to malfunction
So any beat that function I breathe on and puncture
Leave it like a female vagina punctu-
Waiting/showing you her beauty if she's naked
Its like a view of a painting or a lakehead
This shit's how beautiful my day is
Peep me how I'm raising up the capital from Nathan
Capital I'm raising like I'm through punctuating
Or shift keys or it I placement cause
Shifted keys gets your capital raised up

[Hook][Hook]
Rest in Peace
"Here’s another warriors song, rep this life to the fullest"
"Mothafucka, say yo’ prayers!"
"For brothers who died from black-on-black violence"
Rest in Peace
"You ain’t payin’ respect when you’ ‘spose to"
"Rep this life to the fullest"
Rest in Peace
"This ain’t for y’all, this a toast to them"
Rest in Peace

[Verse 1 - Immortal Technique]
Here's a toast to the dead
If you don't drink, smoke to the head
For the freedom fighters killed by the feds
For those who died hard in the streets, soaking in red
And died slow asleep in a dream, choking in bed
Here's a toast to the dead
For my enemies that are gone
I'm not a coward
So celebrating that would be wrong
I pray to God that your soul will come back again
So I can see you in the next life and finish it then
A toast to the dead
For criminals burning in hell
I wonder how many presidents
Are burning as well
Emperors, popes, senators, generals
Amputees feel unlucky
Until they see the vegetables
A toast to the dead
For those who are forgotten
Written out of history
By the corrupted and rotten
Black saints whitewashed during La Reconquista
Thousands of Indios Spaniards used to conquer the Incas
Fuck a moment of silence
I need a moment of violence!
Like the nineteenth century Caribbean islands
Long live those who came before that paved the way for me
The warriors and scientists that came before slavery
And if that last lyric was predictable
Take your clairvoyance and apply it to life in the physical
Presumptuous, half-hearted homunculus
Self-destruction is the power
Without knowing what the function is

[Verse 2]
Here's a toast to the dead
For all of my fam
I will never let an Eyedea/idea die with a man
My rhymes are like Nazca lines designed to give a view of this
J Dilla's still alive as long as his music is
A toast to the dead
For rap legends and pioneers
Your legacy won't be forsaken as long as I am here
Knowledge of the past and wisdom of the present
I'll teach and leave in the hands of a worthy lieutenant
A toast to the dead
For children with cancer and AIDS
A cure exists and you probably could have been saved
Sad to see medicine divorce morality
Corporate homewreckers pimping up the salary
A toast to the dead
For those that'll die today
The victims and those exonerated by DNA
The only thing worse than giving freedom to the guilty
Is killing the innocent and leaving your soul filthy
Immortal Technique, remember me when I'm gone
I encrypted my lyrics to stay alive in a song
So you'll always keep a piece of my spirit inside
When you struggle to complete what I started before I died
But some of you won't survive the changes the Earth makes
Swallowed by tsunamis, hurricanes, and earthquakes
And that's just the first stage if you cannot reverse ways
And realize that we are one regardless of our birthplace

[Hook]

[Outro - Spoken Word by Immortal Technique]

My last toast to the dead is for the listener: human being or extraterrestrial visitor. Remember us for more than our primitive ways when you study us long after the end of our days[Intro]
What do you see when you're in the dark and the demons come?
I see you. I see you standing over the grave of another dead President

[Hook: Bazaar Royale]
I see angels above me
Demons below me
Fighting over heaven, heaven, heaven
It's real

[Verse 1: stic.man]
America's nightmare; young, black, and just don't give a fuck
Run up in the courtroom and wet 'em up
Got nothin' to lose but my handcuffs
Every man must choose to lay down or stand up
It's war time, everything is fair, no fear
When they say the homie murdered the judge, I don't care
Fuck 'em, he deserved it, long as the homie get away
And don't get caught for the crime, I encourage it
We rootin' for the vellein of black
Pourin' out Absolut, salute, niggas is shootin' back
In self-defense we bang the pistol like
Larry Davis or Brian Nichols
Every pig, every public official, the boomerang
Is coming back to get you, you reap what you sow, did you?
The system you created created a monster
And now you scared cause it's coming back to haunt you

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: M-1]
Since we gonna take the blame, I'mma rep my name to get my aim right
Let's have an overthrow and after party in the same night
Same height as Huey, same muscle build as Malcolm
With the same circumstances in the hood, you know the outcome
And read it in the news about your sergeant and your captain
Don't take this as a warning, just another nigga rappin'
Fuck the way we organizing, fuck the training and the grapplin'
And fuck them Uncle Toms who call police because we smack them
And fuck you sympathizers with your middle class reactions
Cause we bangin' on the system, G'd up, fuck the factions
And if you didn't know, the G was for George Jackson
And long live his warrior spirit packin' the Magnum
Watching over the soldiers, knowin' niggas be blackin'
When we really need to be disciplined in our ways and actions
When we get some freedom you niggas can start braggin'
Till then, inside the blood of my eye, you see the dragon

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Immortal Technique]
I'm like the birth of baby Mohammed, the movement I started
Can spar with the hardest, the martyr regarded as Spartacus-hearted
It doesn't matter whose missiles can shoot the farthest
When you're a target in an Afghan Teutoberg Forest
Close quarters combat over corrupted elections
Bilderberg is like cancer, it grows an infection
Nepotism is the gold and the conductor's connection
And ignorance is the prison that the people are kept in
The military ain't there for the people's protection
They're just there to protect an investment
That's why people get arrested, electrocuted, molested
Connected streets are infested with those tired of protestin'
Traumatized children grow to guerilla garrisons
9/11 generations pale in comparison
And you will learn a lesson repeated through history
That no matter what you think, occupation is not victory

[Outro: Immortal Technique]
Somalia, Kashmir
Nigeria, Palestine
Iraq, bring it back

[Hook x2][Intro:]
[DJ Green Lantern]
Fucker
Yeah
Oh shit, it's the evil genius
[Eminem]

[DJ Green Lantern]
A yo Em
Ha ha
What we call this shit right here
[Eminem]
The invasion
You have part one u got part two now its
Part three
The final chapter mother fuckers
Armageddon, lets go

[Hook]
I got a riddle what's little and talks big
With midget arms and creamy white fillin' in the middle
That will do anything to throw dirt on my name
If it means walkin' the whole Mediterranean
Is he an Albanian, Armenian, Iranian, Tasmanian no
His name's Raymond and oh, oh sorry yo so sorry whoah
But that was a long time ago when I was just Joe Shmoe
Rappin' in Joe Blows basement I apologized for it befo', so
Either except it or you don't and lets move on
If I've shown that I've grown and get the bone
Keep lickin' these nuts you industry mutts
Keep walkin' around sniffin' each others butts
Or should I say asses
What would be the more politically correct term to use for the masses

[Lloyd Banks]
Hold up hold up hold up
New york city man
It's the kid Lloyd Banks
And if you hearin' what I'm hearin' right now
You know this ain't no regular shit homy
This something special and we gotta bring this back
Green come on
Countdown to

[Eminem]
Armageddon
Lets go

[Hook]

[Verse 1:]
The question I ask is
How can I explain this
How can I swing this in English language
If I switch to slang and turn mayn to mayn
Do I do it in vain or simply to entertain
Am I being real or am I being fake
Am I just a fraud or am I truly genuine
Or am I caught up in this hot water wody on my daughter
I told ya I love this culture don't let em' insult ya
I'm tell ya one more (a)gain this is the environment that I was brought up in
But every now and then I use my pen to get rid of some frustration
Or should I say or should I say shun
Is it just another one of my subliminal ways of racism
Your face is numb your stunned your look is cold
Like that of a man of seventy some years old
And it only gets colder which Is why I understand
And can't be mad at a forty four year old fan
With a chip on his shoulder who only owns a half of a magazine
And the only way to have it seen is to put me on the front of it again
Only thing that makes him grin is to see me frown
Papa can't stand me papa needs to take his medication and sit the fuck down
In his new chair that goes round and round
That he bought from new money in his bank account
That I get him every issue when the thang comes out
Sit back and let his puffy clown hair come out
And let his black side arm wrestle his white side
Yell Apartheid loud enough that he might slide
He might find someone dumb enough who might ride
But ain't nobody over here buyin' two white guys disguised as pro black
There is no slack
Far heart for college grad. In a fitted hat and a hunch back
Standin' by the clearance coat rack
In some old slacks and tomorrows old throw backs
Yeah

[Outro:]
Shady in the place to be seen
And i got what it takes  to rock the mic right
Still not gonna cater these punks
Fuckin' cocksuckin' pussy lips haters dicks cunts[Intro]
Yeah baby, hehe, yeah!
Back again (that's right) Luda! Ha ha ha ha (Feel this)
It gets meaner and meaner each time baby
Feelin real good too (holla at 'em man) What up Uncle 'Face! (Yeah)
I'm a bull in this industry man (tell 'em)
Some would rather run down and get one cow (nah)
I think I'd rather walk down and get 'em all
You know what I'm talkin 'bout right? Look

[Verse 1]
I'm never going nowhere so don't try me
My music sticks in fans' veins like an IV
Flows poison like Ivy, oh they grimy
Already offers on my 6th album from labels tryin to sign me
Respected highly, "Hi, Mr. O'Reilly!"
Hope all is well, kiss the plaintiff and the wifey
Drove through the window, the industry super sized me
Now the girls see me and a river's what they cry me
I'm on the rise, so many people despise me
Got party ammunition for those tryin to surprise me (surprise!)
It's a celebration and everyone should invite me
Roll with the crew or meet the bottom of our Nikes (blaow!)
Explorer like Dora these swipers can't swipe me
My whole aura's so MEAN in my white tee
Nobody light-skinned reppin harder since Ice-T
You disagree, take the Tyson approach and bite me!

[Hook]
Whoa! Don't slip up or get got! (Why not man?)
I'm comin for that number one spot! (Alright)
Rappers swearin they on top! (Nuh uh, uh uh)
But I'm comin' for they number one spot! (Alright man)
Scheme scheme, plot plot (say WHAT?)
I'm comin for that number one spot! (Woo, hey)
Keep it goin it won't stop! (What you doin man?)
I'm comin for that number one spot!

[Verse 2]
Yes indeed, Ludacris I'm hotter than Nevada
Ready to break the steerin column on yo' Impala
If I get caught, bail out, po'-po' I tell 'em holla
In court I never show up, like Austin Powers fa-zha
Father, father, and hey I love gold
But can buy anything I want from the records I've sold
Jacuzzi's hot, Cristal is so cold
Neighbors catch contacts, from the blunts that I've rolled
A pig in a blanket, a smoke and a pancake
Drop albums non-stop once a year for my fans sake
I crush mics until my hand breaks
Then shag now and shag later 'til these women can't stand straight
The Luda-meister got 'em feelin so randy
I'm +XXL+ so I call 'em my +Eye Candy+
Brush my shoulder and I, pop my collar
Cause I'm worth a million ga-zillion fa-fillion dollars

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Causin lyrical disasters, it's the master
Make music for Mini-Me's, models and Fat Bastards
These women trying to get me out my Pelle Pelle
They strip off my clothes and tell me, "Get in my belly!"
Stay on the track, hit the ground runnin like Flo-Jo
Sent back in time and I've never lost my mojo
Ladies and gentlemen ahh, boys and girls
Ludacris sent down to take over the whole world!

[Hook][Intro - Jadakiss]
Yeah, D-Block
Everywhere we go-oh, people wanna know-oh
Who we arrrre, so we tell them
This is D-Block, mighty mighty D-Block

[Verse 1 - Jadakiss]
Yo, the revolve' or the mati's cool
Knife game like Daddy Cool's, since Bally Shoes
This is real life street shit, truest and the deepest
Known niggas that go to jail just to get they teeth fixed
Think I give a fuck what you herbs say?
When I got the nigga that you trying to be watching my wordplay
Now everybody wanna be 'Pac
Till they ass really get popped and they die on the third day
The Desi's got a beautiful ring
I can hit any one of y'all, options a beautiful thing
Body is finished, maybe they can save the tooth
Call me Kiss or call me the black Babe Ruth
That many hits -- fuck that, that many bricks
D-Block -- that many niggas, gats to your lips
My dope is two toned, but I had to change my spot
Cause it turned into a drug free school zone

[Hook]
[Jadakiss] J.A.D.A
I'm top 5, dead or alive
And that's just off one LP

[Jae Hood] Jae Hood
[Styles P] Two guns up
[Jae Hood] All I know is bitches and money, grams and guns
[Styles P] Here's why they call me the Ghost

[Verse 2 - Sheek Louch]
Yo, I don't give a fuck about pull out, cock back
Spin a motherfucker out, empty his chest
Leave your motherfucking whip a mess
All over the dashboard, in backseat pieces of flesh
Send niggas to the grave with they face half gone
Stomach ripped open, the beef back on
That nigga Sheek rude, I'll spit in your food
Tell the women in ya family to suck my dick
No respect, fuck that -- I'll murder you quick
Mad weapons in the trunk, bitch -- take your pick
Stick a grenade up under your fender
Stick a pineapple bomb in ya blender, I don't care about you
You say fuck Sheek Louch? Well, fuck you too
Your father, your mother, the hole you came through
Niggas don't learn till they're kerosene-d out
Lighter to their face, they'll spit gasoline out
You want me dead, I'm right here -- do it bitch
Make me bleed till I'm motherfucking fluid-less
I ain't new at this and don't give a fuck about you
Sheek'll run up and smack the shit out you
I live this shit, it's never gon' stop
Open niggas' face with a octopus top
Face all ripped up, catch me on the block
Shells all loaded up, catch me wit the Glock
Pussy motherfuckers don't want no beef
Trip niggas down to their platinum teeth
Chase you in the house with the all black heat
Leave you just boxers and slippers on your feet
I talk reckless; I really want the coke and the money
But I'll settle for your necklace
D-Block

[Verse 3 - Jae Hood]
I grew up as a young dude, chilling wit them old cats
Couldn't cop crack so I had to slang Prozac
Fuck being broke, I'm trying to cop a tan four
Trap you up like niggas get Pussy in The Sopranos
You really want beef? I'm busting the Tec
I'll hit you up in the park while you're doing your sets
It's (Jadakiss: D-Block) (yeah yeah y'all!)
You can't get no streeter, nigga
I'm nice wit the hands but I'm better wit the heater
Old school style -- stash haze in my sock
I'll bust at you and turn your Ac' Jeep to a drop
You niggas talking like y'all can't get stuck up
I ain't an icon but y'all will still get fucked up

[Verse 4 - Styles P]
As we continue on, your hood you finish
Write a suicide note and get a window on
Nigga, that's the type of shit we on
Redrum Redrum -- spin it back like a Missy song
Take a cold heart to twist your mom
But it's wintertime, shotty under the snorkle
Will flip when it's dinner time
Strange days without Angela Bassett
Middle of the hood, niggas handling plastic
Gotta watch ya head and not get popped with lead
And watch ya bread, not get popped by Feds
Anywhere we gonna be in the hood
With the burners and the hawks, nigga, being the hood[Intro - Barack Obama - taken from victory speech in Iowa]
They said this day would never come
They said our sights were set too high
This country is too divided, too disillusioned
To ever come together around a common purpose. They said

[Hook]
"Although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black president"
Yes we can change the world, the world, the world

[Verse 1 - Nas]
They forgot us on the block, got us in the box
Solitary confinement: how violent are these cops?
They need a early retirement
How many rallies will I watch? I ain't got it in me to march
I got a Semi to spark, the game's in a drought
Public housing, projects, cooking up in the Pyrex
My set, my clique, either getting money
Or running from homicide trail, that's if they ain't died yet
Trying to be rich, still I'm pledging allegiance
A predicate felon, a ghetto leader
Lending my poetical genius, to whoever may need it
I bleed this from Queensbridge, now living with my feet up
Never defeated, so a president's needed
You know these colored folks and Negros hate to see
One of their own succeeding
America: surprise us and let a black man guide us

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Nas]
What's the black pres' thinking on election night?
Is it: "How can I protect my life? Protect my wife? Protect my rights?"
Every other president was nothing less than white
Except Thomas Jefferson had mixed Indian blood.. and Calvin Coolidge
KKK is like: "What the fuck?!", loading their guns up
Loading up mine too, ready to ride
Cause I'm riding with my crew - he dies, we die too
Yeah, but on the positive side
I think Obama provides hope and challenges minds
Of all races and colors to erase the hate
And try to love one another. So many political snakes
We in need of a break, I'm thinking I can trust this brotha
...but will he keep it way real?
Every innocent nigga in jail gets out on appeal
When he wins, will he really care still?
I feel

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Nas]
Say a prayer for "Do we have to?"
You ain't right, Jeremiah Wrong pastor
In love with a slave master
Sincerely yours, USA's most brave rapper
Jesse carjacker, Uncle Tom kidnapper
Ask around: Bentley coupe off the Richter
Bitch called "Life": I pimped her, what
Politics, politricks, Klan-shooter
Deacon for defense, progress-producer
Nothing on the stove, a survival-booster
Gotta do what we gotta do
We ain't got no governors coming through to help
Anything we need done, gotta do for self
New, improved JFK on the way
It ain't the 60s again, niggas ain't hippies again
We ain't falling for the same traps
Standing on the balconies where they shot the King at
McCain got apologies; ain't nobody hearing that
People need honesty

[Hook]

[Outro - Governor Bill Richardson]
It is my distinct honor, and privilege to introduce
The next President of the United States - Barack Obama[Mike Shinoda]
Yo, you ready do this? ( do that, do that, do that !) Ok
Come on! Let's go!

[Green Lantern]
This is an invasion
Evil genius Green Lantern
Mike Shinoda

[Mike Shinoda]
Ladies and gentlemen
I would like to welcome you to a Fort Minor event
The countdown has begun
The Rising Tied is almost here
But for now...

[Green Lantern]
Come on, Mike! Come on, Mike !

[Mike Shinoda]
Yo, let's get it going in front of every man, anybody
You gotta be ready, it's heavy when we get it rowdy
We won't apologize or even think of saying sorry
This is the way we rock steady over everybody #screeching noise#
Yo, let's get it going in front of every man, anybody
You gotta be ready, it's heavy when we get it rowdy
We won't apologize or even think of saying sorry
You probably shocked, probably ready to stop this already
You probably can't hang with the way we attack it so steady
We let it rock the Rover, bang the Benz, shake the Chevy
'Til everybody feels it in the chest, say it with me

[Hook]
This is the time so just follow me
It's already heated to 100 degrees so
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up

[Mike Shinoda]
Wait a second, you know the program, this is not a slow jam
This is not a love song, unless you love tearing shit down
Take a look around, you're not running this
The bluff in your nothing will hit you like a ton of bricks
Hit you together with pressure you can never stand
The softest leather just a featherweight, never man
We're not your competitors setting you straight
You never compete, forget it, it's already too late, go!

[Hook]
This is the time so just follow me
It's already heated to 100 degrees so
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Yo, if you don't see, I'm a make you see this
If you don't roll, I'm a make you believe it
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up

[Green Lantern]
Shh, give me a second, I'm collecting my thoughts
And setting plots

[Mike Shinoda]
All right y'all ready or not?!
I've listened and watched and waited for an opening spot
And now that I got it, nobody can pay me to stop
I'm sick of that same thing I've been forced to hear
Over and over again, let me make this clear
If anybody pretends that we're nothing to fear
I solemnly swear it's over, you can tell 'em we're here

[Hook]
This is the time so just follow me
It's already heated to 100 degrees so
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Yo, if you don't see, I'm a make you see this
If you don't roll, I'm a make you believe it
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up

Everybody owes, everybody pays
Because...[Intro]
What do you see when you're in the dark and the demons come?
I see you. I see you standing over the grave of another dead President

[Hook: Bazaar Royale]
I see angels above me

If I've shown that I've grown and get the bone
Keep lickin' these nuts you industry mutts
Keep walkin' around sniffin' each others butts
Or should I say asses
What would be the more politically correct term to use for the masses

[Lloyd Banks]
Hold up hold up hold up
New york city man
It's the kid Lloyd Banks
And if you hearin' what I'm hearin' right now
You know this ain't no regular shit homy
This something special and we gotta bring this back
Green come on
Countdown to

[Eminem]
Armageddon
Lets go

[Hook]

[Verse 1:]
The question I ask is
How can I explain this
How can I swing this in English language
If I switch to slang and turn mayn to mayn
Do I do it in vain or simply to entertain
Am I being real or am I being fake
Am I just a fraud or am I truly genuine
Or am I caught up in this hot water wody on my daughter
I told ya I love this culture don't let em' insult ya
I'm tell ya one more (a)gain this is the environment that I was brought up in
But every now and then I use my pen to get rid of some frustration
Or should I say or should I say shun
Is it just another one of my subliminal ways of racism
Your face is numb your stunned your look is cold
Like that of a man of seventy some years old
And it only gets colder which Is why I understand
And can't be mad at a forty four year old fan
With a chip on his shoulder who only owns a half of a magazine
And the only way to have it seen is to put me on the front of it again
Only thing that makes him grin is to see me frown
Papa can't stand me papa needs to take his medication and sit the fuck down
In his new chair that goes round and round
That he bought from new money in his bank account
That I get him every issue when the thang comes out
Sit back and let his puffy clown hair come out
And let his black side arm wrestle his white side
Yell Apartheid loud enough that he might slide
He might find someone dumb enough who might ride
But ain't nobody over here buyin' two white guys disguised as pro black
There is no slack
Far heart for college grad. In a fitted hat and a hunch back
Standin' by the clearance coat rack
In some old slacks and tomorrows old throw backs
Yeah

[Outro:]
Shady in the place to be seen
And i got what it takes  to rock the mic right
Still not gonna cater these punks
Fuckin' cocksuckin' pussy lips haters dicks cunts[Hook: Melonie Fiona and Wale]
Babe you know it gets no better than this
It's like sunshine on a rainy day
It's like a high, could you take me away?
Take me away away
It's a beautiful bliss
When you feel like this
When you spill out hits
When you fly as a bitch
And you ride with this
And you ain't bothered a bit now, baby

[Verse 1 - Wale]
Fresh out the airport
Fresh out the chair with the clippers
Like Shaun living, thinking hmm
I'm trying to get it like Sean get it
If lord giveth a mill and a milf light skinneded
It's slight blemishes and life system
But I'm giving it foundation when I write lyric
That anvil Neidhart minus bright knickers
Maybe not quite the star but my heart's in it
When Bret Hart meet Brett Farve
A sharp shooter well exceeding any figure four
You see my figure more or less six or more
I invest in my larynx and lungs and this voice I project
My project is like what pros inject
And a nigga so fly I should be droved in jets
It's ironic they call me a fresh breath no joke
You see dem boys sign me to the scope right

[Hook]

[Verse 2: J.Cole]
I phone home to the real they wanna know just how it feel
Who woulda thought a lil nigga from the Ville could get a deal
And tell dem niggas at the top we want yo spot we are for real
And, yeah, we heard you got it locked but like dem socks we on your heels
So you best be on your toes, nigga
Especially on your flows, nigga
Cause man they keep on checking for me especially all your hoes, nigga
Catch me on your doorstep you see me let me in
All I wanna do is eat I'm like the freaky lesbian
Now all I wanna do is ball on TV need E-S-P-N
They heard I'm bout to blow, so all my enemies say let's be friends
And all these rappers know just where I'm bout to go so catch me then
And all the girls we knew that screamed fuck you going let me then
I'm definitely in a class of my own, at dinner with Hov
Hoping that he pass the baton, he just pass the Patron
Ain't nothing given, dog, it's earned if you just living, dog, you learn
I let you niggas see the light I'm like the prison yard, I yearn
For that living large, but mama I ain't done yet
Sit back and watch your sunrise
Kick back and know yo son set
Forever I ain't run yet and I never will
Nas told me life's a bitch
Pac said fuck the world and I ain't come yet
You up yet
My punchlines like gut checks I'm raw-dog
I'm rough sex
I'm on deck I'm up next
I'm godbless, I'm success so fuck stress
You can get the fuck from around me
And if you listening know you wondering
Where the fuck they found me
I'm from the Ville, boy

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Wale]
Another day up in my ES
Wish it was an LS
But elastic is my wallet, fuck it
I don’t be stressed like relaxed muscles
Your feedback ain't flexing
And you can keep it running like a muffler
When we not in summer
They like A-list actors they not no stunners
Too much practice now for me to malfunction
So any beat that function I breathe on and puncture
Leave it like a female vagina punctu-
Waiting/showing you her beauty if she's naked
Its like a view of a painting or a lakehead
This shit's how beautiful my day is
Peep me how I'm raising up the capital from Nathan
Capital I'm raising like I'm through punctuating
Or shift keys or it I placement cause
Shifted keys gets your capital raised up

[Hook][Intro - Barack Obama - taken from victory speech in Iowa]
They said this day would never come
They said our sights were set too high
This country is too divided, too disillusioned
To ever come together around a common purpose. They said

[Hook]
"Although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black president"
Yes we can change the world, the world, the world

[Verse 1 - Nas]
They forgot us on the block, got us in the box
Solitary confinement: how violent are these cops?
They need a early retirement
How many rallies will I watch? I ain't got it in me to march
I got a Semi to spark, the game's in a drought
Public housing, projects, cooking up in the Pyrex
My set, my clique, either getting money
Or running from homicide trail, that's if they ain't died yet
Trying to be rich, still I'm pledging allegiance
A predicate felon, a ghetto leader
Lending my poetical genius, to whoever may need it
I bleed this from Queensbridge, now living with my feet up
Never defeated, so a president's needed
You know these colored folks and Negros hate to see
One of their own succeeding
America: surprise us and let a black man guide us

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Nas]
What's the black pres' thinking on election night?
Is it: "How can I protect my life? Protect my wife? Protect my rights?"
Every other president was nothing less than white
Except Thomas Jefferson had mixed Indian blood.. and Calvin Coolidge
KKK is like: "What the fuck?!", loading their guns up
Loading up mine too, ready to ride
Cause I'm riding with my crew - he dies, we die too
Yeah, but on the positive side
I think Obama provides hope and challenges minds
Of all races and colors to erase the hate
And try to love one another. So many political snakes
We in need of a break, I'm thinking I can trust this brotha
...but will he keep it way real?
Every innocent nigga in jail gets out on appeal
When he wins, will he really care still?
I feel

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Nas]
Say a prayer for "Do we have to?"
You ain't right, Jeremiah Wrong pastor
In love with a slave master
Sincerely yours, USA's most brave rapper
Jesse carjacker, Uncle Tom kidnapper
Ask around: Bentley coupe off the Richter
Bitch called "Life": I pimped her, what
Politics, politricks, Klan-shooter
Deacon for defense, progress-producer
Nothing on the stove, a survival-booster
Gotta do what we gotta do
We ain't got no governors coming through to help
Anything we need done, gotta do for self
New, improved JFK on the way
It ain't the 60s again, niggas ain't hippies again
We ain't falling for the same traps
Standing on the balconies where they shot the King at
McCain got apologies; ain't nobody hearing that
People need honesty

[Hook]

[Outro - Governor Bill Richardson]
It is my distinct honor, and privilege to introduce
The next President of the United States - Barack Obama[DJ Green Lantern]
This is an invasion, an occupation
Immortal Technique, the evil genius DJ Green Lantern
And you're now in the state of guerrilla warfare
It has been spread by the superpowers of the industry
To the 3rd World underground of the streets
This is for all those who've been labeled extremists, maniacs, terrorists
Shit.. Welcome to the 3rd World

[Immortal Technique]
Yeah.. Yeah..

Invasion and rampant monetary inflation
That brought us all to the footsteps of this nation
Peruvians, Haitians, Ecuadorians, Nicaraguans, Colombians, Salvadorians
Invasion and rampant monetary inflation
That brought us all to the footsteps of this nation
[2x]

Invasion and rampant monetary inflation
That brought us all to the footsteps of this nation
Peruvians, Haitians, Ecuadorians, Nicaraguans, Colombians, Salvadorians
They call us terrorists after they ruined our countries
Funding right-wing paramilitary monkeys
Tortured our populace then blamed the communists
Your lies are too obvious, propaganda monotonous
And that's not socialist mythology
This is urban warfare through the streets of your psychology
So I'm like the legs of a paraplegic really
Cause I'm still part of you even if you can't feel me
You can never debate me, The M4s at your baby
Like troops with gats in Iraq do daily
So you can marginalize the way you portray me
But don't get Hollywood and try to play me
We can shoot it out in the theater like troops in the 80s
New Jack City classic crack era, mack-milli
Shouting BET is not black-owned on Rap City
You got a contract to kill me motherfucker, that's fine
Cause there's a contract to kill your family when I die
So when your car explodes, don't be surprised
Soldier, I'm like Marine Corp C4
Even blow the spot with the beat rocking at 3/4
Canvas the flow like the ghost of Michelangelo
This is the anthem, Immortal Technique and Green Lantern
Don't say shit bitch, you don't want the "check, check"
To become a ::chick, chick:: You know what I'm sick with
Lyrical tuberculosis, cocaine overdoses
Blood coming out your noses, that's when death approaches
March to my death smiling, laugh if the end's violent
There's no escape from this political asylum

Revolutionaries don't fear execution
Cause the death of my visible Constitution
Is just the beginning of spiritual evolution
God will reincarnate me as revolution

[DJ Green Lantern]
You can't take out a revolution
You can't kill a idea
Fuck is you stupid?
You kill that man, he becomes Immortal

[Immortal Technique]
Ignore the triplets, this is a fully loaded four-four
3rd World underground hardcore
Street-hop, locked and loaded, motherfucker you should know it
Blast the door to the game open and overthrow it[Intro X4]
I'm close to the edge
Don't push me

[Verse 1: stic.man]
Yo, this recession got a nigga losing calories
Can't get no food in your stomach without that salary
Gotta come up by any means, my mentality
Don't wanna dream about it, gotta bring it to reality
On my side of town, this ain't new, this is life
If you ain't lived it then you have no idea what it's like
To go to bed with excruciating pain in your abdomen
So hungry you can't sleep, you just lay awake imagining
Big dreams, big schemes, big risk takin'
Penitentiary waiting for me if I'm mistaken
Paying dues, can't lose, failure's not an option
The only way is up when your coming from the bottom
Tired of watching all these companies get bailed out
And the only thing that poor people get is another jail house
That's why ain't nothing patriotic in me
For they system my heart is empty

[Hook: stic.man]
Don't hate my grind
We gotta make a way
Though things is getting tougher everyday
Where there's a hustle there's a way
Don't hate my grind
We gotta find a way
Though things is getting rougher everyday
Where there's a hustle there's a way
Don't hate...

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Another day up in this servant concrete village
Trying to live in a world where they just rob and pillage
I'm waking up in the clothes that I west to sleep in
I pick up my pistol and I get back out on the creep
And I see the same bullshit I just saw the day befo'
Drugs and the murders and my people trying to play me yo
I ain't about that bullshit and they already know it
I don't want to have to kill but still I can't show it
So I mean mug them, screw face them, and I twist up
Hand on my strap while I'm balling my other fist up
Pass me the piff and roll me another spliff up
Cause one way or another my nigga I'm finsta lift up
Above the troubles and the stress and the mess
I'm just hoping that the good Lord is choosing me to bless
I'm tired of this world trying to fuck me like a pussy
My nigga I'm close to the edge don't push me

[Hook]
Don't hate my grind
We gotta make a way
Though things is getting tougher everyday
Where there's a hustle there's a way
Don't hate...

[Verse 3: M1]
Ain't no retirement from this profession
Plan B is the Smith & Wesson
It's reliable
No 401k for this runaway slave
Fuck tomorrow when we hungry today
But you don't here me though
We be surviving off of Cheerios and videos
We get a dose of the high-fructose and there we go
A recipe for the grind, AKA the struggle
AKA the muscle, AKA the hustle
It's hard enough for us to trust one another
When I see you as a threat, not my sister or my brother
I hope one day we put this all behind us
And resurrect the grind museum for memories to remind us

[Hook]

[Verse 4: stic.man]
I feel like Melle Mel on "The Message"
I'm close to the edge don't push me
I'm trying to hold my head but its hard out here for a pimp man
The cemetery's waiting for you if you slip man
Another day of oppression
They call it possession, it's media misdirection
But you know what get's greeted by repression?
A long overdue, much needed insurrection
It's a cold world, but I'm a grown man
And a grown man needs power in his own hands
Ain't no sitting around, waitin' complainin'
Unless your in love with the plantation

[Hook]If anybody's out there listening to this broadcast of mine
Let me tell you ladies and gentlemen what's on my mind
I won’t pull any punches hold anything back
I'll tell you the way that it is
When it's all said and done i'm gonna leave you wondering
How did we do what we did?

Yo, I don't care if you're a woman or a child or man
When I'm done everybody's gonna understand
Some rappers get mad when you say they're in a band
But, not me
Cause I really am
It's LP for your fucking information pal
So you can stop staring back over your shoulder now
You can't stop me mugging with that twisted brow
Concentrating on mine
You're wasting your time buddy
Erase that face
Replace the frown
Look at the ground
Look down
Quit fucking around
Now jeez, everyone's been so tightly wound
From the minute that we became the new menace in town
Could it be that these cool, contagious
Phrases sprayed aimless
Are making ya'll hate us?
Shit, you can hate 'til your face turns blue
Everyone else
Let me cut up a question for you

If anybody's out there listening to this broadcast of mine
Let me tell you ladies and gentlemen what's on my mind
I won’t pull any punches hold anything back
I'll tell you the way that it is
When it's all said and done i'm gonna leave you wondering
How did we do what we did?

Oh, there goes another one
Better call all your people in
Bury the body quick stupid
Show you where I’m coming from
Open up the cellar
To the pelican's bliss
With delicatessenal sitting 'til your skeleton splits
He sets us off now
Don’t know which direction is which
We all fell
Little weapons with consecutive hits
But that’ll be that
So never mind your battery pack
Cause in reality nobody gives a crappity-crap
Move over, before you get your flattery snatched
You tiny caterpillars act like you don’t have any sex
Hopping over the gums drilling holes in cavity caps
They’re full of shit to the root now
Pass me that Jack
On the rocks is Tak
Back on the block what?
Tapping your vest like I just happen to pop up
Trapped in a circle
And now he’s itching to box
But no way I’m ‘a stop
Until I’m waiting your snot pus

If anybody's out there listening to this broadcast of mine
Let me tell you ladies and gentlemen what's on my mind
I won’t pull any punches hold anything back
I'll tell you the way that it is
When it's all said and done i'm gonna leave you wondering
How did we do what we did?

I just say what I feel I don’t care if I’m black balled
Walk up in the label start waving a hack-saw
Hit the bathroom strip naked and jack-off
This white boy’s getting more gangster than Mac Mall
I’m in the crowd I’m feeding your fans roofies
Nope, that ain't a coke it’s a Vicodin smoothie
Yeah, acting boozy a thug like fuck it
Got a champagne taste with a bud light budget
Got a little-ass dick with some [something backwards] on it
So sick I could make a fucking maggot vomit
No Shit
Get the mic’s out
Kick it in gear
It’s Ludacris
All I needed was some chicken and beer
You better, roll out while the coast is clear
We've been hit with thick bottles and a broken chair
Bitch please you can leave with a couple of cracked teeth
Don’t pump me for the fame
I ain't crapped for six weeks / so

If anybody's out there listening to this broadcast of mine
Let me tell you ladies and gentlemen what's on my mind
I won’t pull any punches hold anything back / I'll
Tell you the way that it is

How did we do what we did?

If anybody's out there listening to this broadcast of mine[Jim Jones:]
Who's in charge? I'm asking y'all
Somebody better answer before I blast at y'all
Live life just as fast as y'all
But you little niggas know that my cash is tall
New York like Stoudemire
You think your hot, well I'm on fire
The money wash up and I'm tryna dry it
If a new car drops, then I'm tryna buy it
Cam front, kinda tired
Had a bitch last night, left her in the higher
At the party, music loud
(?) move the crowd
Then we Clinton Spark 'em
Damn right, let my niggas chalk 'em
All my dogs bite, we gon do the barking
And the money speak loud, we gon do the talking
And what you do with the bread
U went to the ghetto and tell 'em Su Woo bred
And I'm sorry to say, lift the back now home boy the 'rari today
Such a horrible day
(?) Bouquet
Married to the game, I don't need no bouqeut
Just a new whip and it got her to pay
So I tell 'em touche
Go nigga, Go
Rozay mo'
Just got started, tell 'em ten mo'
With a bitch on my side with some hips like woah

[Hook:]
Lemme see you hit the floor (c'mon)
I know that your with it
Till ya body sore
Girl you know you can get it
I'm gonna play for you tonight like it's your birthday
Tonight I'm gonna be you're favorite DJ
Say Go, Go, Say Go DJ
Say Go, Go, Say Go DJ
Say Go, Go, Say Go DJ
Tonight I'm gonna be your favorite DJ

[Bun B:]
Lights is flashing, cameras filming
Soon as we walked up in the building
Bopers fainting, haters kneeling
I smell like money, look like a trillionaire
And I really don't care how you feeling
Big-faced hundred dollar bills I'm peeling
Bottles stacked up to the ceiling
And I just can't explain the feeling
Fellas, put your grands up
Ladies, put your hands up
We sipping Jimmy Neutron, player, and I can barely stand up
R.I.P. to the Pimp, you know I rep for UGK
Get 4 million with Clinton Sparks, your favorite DJ

[Hook]

[Game:]
Hit 'em with the punchline, hit 'em with the bass
Blowing that orange kush all in my face
Glock on my hip, nigga, murder was the case
Any nigga want drama, boy, I hit 'em with the 'K
Nigga act cool, nigga, hit 'em with a J
Swim in that pool, Pat and Ryan all day
Nigga need work, I got birds in the safe
Ski mask in the cut hand, keys to the Maybach
Where you lay at, bitch, I scope I never miss where I spray at
Underground King, nigga, UGK that
You should try crack all night, all day that
Tell me where the weight at
ZipLock baggies all in the trunk
Going through the zone blowing that purple stunk
It's the critics, get it?
(?) only got straight A's in physics
Dope boy business, Dope boy flashy
Chains on my neck, elbows still ashy
Hood nigga for real
Ask my nigga Pharrell
Turning my fingers on, the boy is the raw deal
Chicks all dimes, the motto is cash peels
Each one of them off down in Louis Vuitton heels
Tell 'em muthafuckas that the legend is real
Sleep next to a dime that I wake up to a meal
House on the hills
Where Hurricane lay his head at
Anywhere in the U.S., that's where I get my bread at
Nigga play the 9 by my waist, where the lead at?
Anywhere that I shoot, same spot nigga dig that?
Yellow take nigga
Clinton Sparks on the California quake nigga
When the light on, quick to kill a fake nigga
Cash Money in my pocket like the Drake nigga (nigga)

[Hook:]Gangsta Gangsta with a "A" not a "ER"(x3)
Cuz all I gees I know are part of the revolution

[Verse 1: Stic. Man]

Its not a word to be claiming jus cause it sound cool
The game's so twisted today for lack of ground rules
Is a man of his word a man of action
Never begging, complaining he make it happen
It's not the image they selling us on the TV screen
Is a suvivor, a rider provide by any means
Moving stragey outsmarting his enemies
Ready to give his life, you still wanna be a g?
It's not something you claim just because you from the hood
Everything twisted the game is so misunderstood
Used to be a protector, man of the people
Now they most followers man, where are the leaders?
A ghetto superstar is cool but I know something harder
You dont know gangsta till you know about Bunchy Cater, Aunty Assata, Soondiati Ecoli
Not to disrespect their legacy but thats the real OG's
The one who has the biggest mouth to be the biggest coward
No time for petty beef a gee is about getting power
Thats why you can only be down after initiation
So niggas know how you respond in different situations

Gangsta Gangsta with a "A" not a "ER"
Cuz All I Gees I know are part of the revolution

[Verse 2: Styles P]

He was a mean one nah he was born one
He dont ever say a thing when the law comes
He dont need a posse of brothers that act wild
He works a Hard Job and tries to raise a black child
He breaks bread with his people like Jesus did
He tried to explain to the children what the evils is
Knows the spots where the crack, coke and diesel is
Did some time in the pen now he diesel kid
He know the penile system is part slavery
Knows that the judge on the stand is where the pagan be
Knows freedom is priceless it takes bravery
He knows I ain't an animal but they caging me
He plays DP thinking about his DP's
Wish he had a hundred guns headed up to DC
He wants change like Obama did
Probably lived where your mama lives

[Verse 3: M1]
Is is the bandana, the hat, the loafs or the gatt
I tell you off the bat hell nah it ain't none of that
It ain't the smell of the chronic the broken ebonics
They be the main ones poppin that shit but they dont want it
Willing to live or to die for what he believe in
He know the code of the streets you can't decieve him
A gangsta's word is his bond you must respect that
He keep his flag and his rep well protected
Is it the bankroll? The bulletproff tank? no
Look at his tattoos the women about to faint so
He could of went to jail but been the biggest snitch Or
He could when you trust your loyality you switch

Gangsta Gangsta with a "A" not a "ER" (x3)
Cuz All I Gees I know are part of the revolution

Bring it to your nugget like AI, I dare ya

[Hook: Akon (w/ Royce Da 5'9")]
Nigga don't make me have to step in the club with my dogs
And show all you motherfuckers how we ball
Nigga don't make me show you how I can violate the law
Get your woman, go up in her raw dog
Now the ho love me, waiting to show me
(Look, bitch you just a fuck) and that how she gon' be
But niggas wanna handcuff of l.o.v.e
Steady claiming they're a pimp but will let her go free
Man that ain't gangster, they're just fronting like they're hard
But I'm knowing that they're pussy from the start
Man that ain't gangster, still in the projects
But I spent a hundred thousand on a car
I rather have a crib in Miami with a boat
Put all my niggas on so we don't go broke
Yeah show them the ropes, sticking together, niggas try to cope
Anyone step in the way will get (*gunshots*)

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9"]
Yeah, I'm 'bout to toe tag this
Leave your face looking like Justin Timberlake when he thought he owed taxes
Airball like Ray Charles with no glasses
I'm playing everything, instinct like Bo Jackson
I make niggas bow to the game before Madden
But no passing, just flows and fours flashing
Oh, I'm so, I'm so old-fashioned
Knife up close, I poke and throat slashing
I don't slang dope, I smoke and pump passion
I don't piss, I point dick and dump ashes
I married the game, I estimated I should get out
Tonight is guaranteed, yesterday was not
I live by the way of Carlito, I'm tied to the streets
But one cut can separate the knot
I start off big, but my voice escalate to Pac
Christmas spirit, light up trees and decorate the block
That Halloween light up the green lant, bring back, we

My sound is flyer than a lot of producers, higher than Lollapalooza

So let's get right to it and groove
It ain't nothin but a thing to get ya people to move
Gotta lovin the way we swing when we step on the scene
You know we kill it, goin all out, we about to {"G-g-g-g-g-get it!"}

[Ryu]
Yo, it's in my blood, I was born to spit it
The coroner has kept me warm through the storms of winter
Ignored the pain and struggle when it's time for dinner
We huddle together and grind, rain or shine
Survive the weather, forget about changin spinners
Throw me a bone, I'm just tryin to raise my litter
It made me bitter, eventually made me sicker
So when the heat's on we don't get pre-game jitters, uh-uh
We go to work man, diggin in dirt
We took 'em to church, we're checkin in some teenage strippers
Livin life by the seat of my pants and three-peated
We champs, undefeated we can't, lose ever
Whoever want it with us better roll with a camp
You trust to cover your ass when your asses can't
Huh, so bottom's up, here's one for the crew
Put some liquor in your gut and tell me what you wanna do, sing it

[Interlude: Ryu (Tak)]
S - for every sucker left behind
O - what they were yellin when I bust a rhyme
B - best believe when it's time to get it
We grind and jet cause we ain't got time to kick it, no!
(S - for the drunk sexy women)
(O - sippin Jack with some Pepsi in it)
B - best believe when it's time to get it
We grind and jet cause we ain't got time to kick it, no!

[Hook]

[Tak]
Wow, look at 'em now, their mouths are closed
We done came a long way since 2004
Spilled "Bleach" got the whole entire crowd exposed
The fumes leakin in the street, throwin down them 'bows, whoa
We on the job, the run with the mob
The fake fa?ades to get it just to make new large
I roll a, seven to nine just to break the yards
And step in your mind and unfold the great bizarre
Hit the kill switch, yeah, found my hitch
I'm on the pitcher's mound for now, it's me and Will Smith
Finally overseas, I sneak in the mattress
Ain't nothin like a sweet club freak with an accent
We out gettin bent makin dollar amounts
So if you with me let me see you raise your bottomless shots, say it

Gonna be somebody (for anybody tellin me I can't)

Gonna be someone (and maybe you'll get it when I'm finally done)It's Tragedy Khadafi - reppin' wit my nigga Green Lantern -
All y'all coward ass niggas
Put some grease on your motherfuckin' feet and slide, nigga!
Yo -

What it be like?
Niggas want to face-fight, I stay tight, stay right
Get your wig split
Shit that I spit - most accurate
Lex right in back of it
Range on the side of it
Dough, I'm trying to get a lot of it
I rock that exotic shit
Plus spit the hottest shit
Blow trial? Might get the same time Gigante get
Death Before Dishonor shit
Gangsta persona shit
2-5, Murder Inc. niggas - who I holla wit
When I wanna score, Green Lantern's who I polly wit
Your 'hood to my projects
Exchange objects
Your guns for my techs
Your Range for my Lex'
From Q.B. to upstate - we control set
I stay splurgin' - head stay wrapped in turban
Game tight like a virgin - Ford Excursion
Nigga how you figure that we don't be reppin'?
Wholesale drugs and weapons in a Dodge Intrepid
What a thug about?
Y'all niggas gettin' slugged out
In the back seat
Showin' the Beast the drug house
I'll cut your tongue out
Mail it to your spouse
If I get knocked, the bail money's under the house
To my thugs in the Dirty South - tear the club up
Masked and gloved up(What we gonna do Trag?)
We gettin' fucked up
For the blood 'fetti
Hoes and drug 'fetti
Jump it off, ready for war - we slug ready
Coward ass niggas eat a dick and die slow
And for the record - I love my hoes(Y'all niggas ain't ready)
I respect when you strap packs under your clothes
Chains stay froze - lock and load
Get your money up, shorty - it's the life you chose
What you know about the princess cut - the icicles?
Lick you 'til your knees get weak and feel crippled
Blood over money - nothing come between my family
Embrace what you give and take what you don't hand me
It's gangsta - 2-5 shit - fuck a Grammy

I wanna do something a little different
Just to let y'all niggas know you can't fuck with me
Don't try this man, you are not me
Young Wiz

[Hook]
And if you fuck with me, grow

[Verse]
Used to just be a young'n spit-spittin' shit
Now I'm grown up in the game and get-gettin' it
Some of my old friends I can't kick it with
You a little slow, I'll show you what big business is
I be with those who own they own businesses
Blowin' big knots in spots where all the bitches is
I'm a star, don't talk to all the bitches-es
Give 'em time, they run to me like a finish line
Hatin' ass nigga actin' like a friend of mine
Get your day cut short like it's winter time
And I'm in the gr-grind 'til the end of time
The Young Beast, I'mma eat when it's dinner time
And my cig-cigarillo fill-filled with pine
Shit locked, but you still denyin'
That I'm the best that did, and the best that's do-doin' it
Prince of the city, I'm showin' and pro-provin' it
I'm on track, you cats are lo-losin' it
Go head, come at Wiz and look stupider
They said reach for the stars, I hit Jupiter
And now I'm workin' on my next galaxy
Never be another Young Khalifa after me
.25, you ain't even half of me
I work hard dawg, no I don't relax a day
Could eat all y'all but I don't like the aftertaste
What you niggas know about blowin' halfs of ray
In the lab gettin' 3 songs smashed a day
Got money up front, call it cash today
Got 3 bank accounts puttin' cash away
I do me to the fullest like Castaway
Throw a beat on and let a blunt ash away
I laugh today, and make y'all cry later
If the young boy reppin' the 'Burgh then why hate him
But I ain't worried cause my stacks gettin' bigger
If you ain't heard around, bitch I'm that ni-nigga
See me ridin' round window cracked, lit Swisher
Can't talk currency, I can't get wit ya
Who got it fucked up? Y'all convinced 'em
The hate in the equation just a small addition
My name Wiz Khalifa, but just call me mister...
4, 1, 2

[Hook]
And if you fuck with me, grow[Intro]
Let me welcome both of you to the show this morning to talk
About what I consider a very, very important topic of the Harlem Renaissance
But before we get into that

[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]
Harlem once was red line district rated
Designated ghetto like the yellow star of David
And you wonder why people don't own their homes
Cause the racist bank wouldn’t fucking mortgage a loan
Until after the invasion of gentrification
Eminent domain intimidation
That's not negotiation, and it's frustrating to look at
Every day, like watching a porno, on 56k
Biohazard labs instead of storerooms
Whats next motherfucker, projects as dorm rooms
You ain't fooling nobody in this community duke
With your little fake Manhattanville community group
Ivy League, real estate firms are corrupt
They lay siege to your castle like the Moors in Europe
They treat street vendors like criminal riffraff
While politicians get the corporate kickback

[Refrain]
Harlem Renaissance, a revolution betrayed
Modern day slaves, thinkin' that the ghetto is saved
Till they start deporting people off the property
Ethnically cleansing the hood, economically
They wanna kill the real Harlem Renaissance
Tryna put the Virgin Mary through an early menopause
The savior is a metaphor for how we set it off
Guerrilla war against the rezoning predators

[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]
When I speak about Harlem I speak to the world
The little Afghan boy and the Bosnian girl
The African of Sudan, the people of Kurdistan
The third world American, indigenous man
Palestinians, Washington Heights Dominicans
Displaced New Orleans citizens
Beach front Brazilian favelas that you livin' in
The hood is prime real estate, they want back in again
I didn't write this to talk shit, I say it because
Some of ya'll forgot what the Harlem Renaissance was
We had revolution, music, and artisans
But the movement was still fucked up like Parkinson's
Cause while we were giving birth to the culture we love
Prejudice kept our own people outta the club
Only colored celebrities in the party
And left us a legacy of false superiority
W.E.B. Du Bois versus Marcus Garvey
And we ended up, selling out to everybody
The Dutch Schultz and John Gotti's
Banksters, modern day gangsters
Immobile army
They wanna move us all out the NYC
Like they did to the Jews
With the Alhambra Decree
So support your own businesses and do the knowledge
Cause the real Harlem Renaissance is economic

[Refrain]

[Outro]
When they were saying it is the renaissance of Harlem
They didn't mean that we had stake in that
They meant to say that they could make money out of us
They are coming in with all kinds of prejudices
In Brooklyn they're doing the same thing
In Queens they're doing the same thing
The Bronx, there's hardly any place which is affordable
I mean those people are putting up condominiums which start from a million dollars
How many people in this community make that kind of money
How many people HAVE that kind of money
People of Harlem, they are the natural allies of the oppressed people of the world
Whether the struggle is in Panama, in Africa, Cuba
We spend money with the wrong people
We are looking for love with people
Who don't love us
What's wrong with loving each other and making sure we are protected[Hook: Royce Da 5'9"]
I'm illa rhyme spitter
I am like an arms dealer
I sell heat to the streets nigga
C'mon
Shine til I'm blind nigga
Dime getter
I sell heat to the streets nigga

[Royce]
It's like nigga hate and we line up
All of them in one place
And we give them standing ovations
And I don't mean like Rihanna
I mean, squeezin' that llama
Dumb rappin', gun clappin', knee deep in that drama
Bakin' like a salon(a)
I'mma
Fight 'em like I'm in 'Nam(a)
Night 'em like a pajama
Bite him like a piranha
Hok, spit on ya Honor

[Kid Vishis]
Kurt Cobain, suicidal
You got the nerve of Nirvana
Bullets touch men and women
Just as quick as Madonna
Little nigga
I'll do to ya momma
What the KKK wanna do to Obama
I just need one K
I'm a repeat blocka
Tear up your whole block

[Royce Da 5'9"]
The drum hold a hundred hot ones
I'mma
5 comma
9 apostrophe ass nigga
Spaz happy
Slash colostomy bag giver

[Kid Vishis]
Slash the ass kicker
Slash the last lyrical ass nigga
Imperial swag
C'mon

[Hook]

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Nigga know they don't want it with me
I'm the gas mask
To niggas that's runnin' on E
High as a wavy neighbor
I want my just due, two mules and 80 acres
Lady Day to stretch her pussy out like baby labor
The beefs embedded in me, I got fillet behavior
I got the A.R.-itis

[Kid Vishis]
Pop, shady flavor
I got gravy paper
That means I'm on top
That gun cocked is goin' down like Yung Joc
I'm the 80's savior
You want doe, I be the baker
Cakes up, I oven haters
I'm who made ya
I'm Kobe Bryant
Who care about the rest of you Lakers?
Infiltrate the truth and expose what's left

[Royce Da 5'9"]
We the best haters
Put you on respirators
Put money on your head and up it like an escalator
Page full of rhymes
I'm about to lay the paper
I do the labor, Keno do the day to day stuff

[Hook]From the power bestowed upon me by the third coast
Deep in the trenches of Atlanta where they learned most
You never heard before flows this extra ordinary
And if the burners blow foes is in the mortuary

Here to prevent the destruction of this rap music
Find a blank spot on my wall and put a plaque to it
I'm in the class all by myself nobody's messing with me
Feel free to ask about my wealth I got the weapons with me

So come and get me I'm here
Keep the semi-automatic near no need to fear I wipe out your windshield ‘til you see me clear
[Repeat]
I ruin careers so hide away your tears no shook ones here until you look inside the mirror
Shift rap into second gear stood up and I volunteer now the industry's screaming but can you hear
The ladies just cheer sometimes their lipstick will smear ‘cause in my line of work this He-man needs a She-Ra

I've been appointed straight from the power of Grayskull
Believe the master of the universe gets great skull
I'm so ferocious chopping heads off with my battle axe
Got many faces give them whiplash when I battle Zakk
A diabolical technology like Skeletor
But trained in the art of throwing you through the cellar door
I'm checking off my enemies until I get them all
With powerful beams that disperse from my Ludacris-tal balls

Until the system falls their families will miss’em all kiss’em all goodbye and I try to warn all of ‘em
I guess I really pissed ‘em off peel the cap and twist them off if you got homies then call all of ‘em
These bombs are ticking them off fans are ripping them off your CDs ain’t purchased people just borrow ‘em
And me I'm dismissing them all really insisting they all quit and hurry up before tomorrow comes!

I've been unleashed from the belly of the beast man
Let's have a feast I'll put the toast up to your teeth man
With a flick of my wrist switches I'll activate
Turbo packs which insure me that your back’ll break
As Mekaneck neck extends straight up and bends
You'd be wishing you wore Depends and called a couple friends
I’ll conjure potions that surge power from my finger tips
Don’t get the notion I can give some middle finger tips

It’s just a gift from me to you and there's no telling what we would do
I keep the crew close by and their ready to clap clap
I keep the beef in the stew till they look like Winnie the Pooh
If you have no clue then I recommend that you get back back
See I'm only keeping it true that’s what real players will do
And I'll let the hollow just spew you'd be under attack tack
And then I'll bid you ado and probably send you a few flowers to your funeral no way to snapback

A place where sorcery science and magic intertwine
And where mysterious forces maintain the streets is mine
With special automatic armor that contains gadgets
No one can get to my level I think the game’s had it
I can transform bionic appendages
Challenge your thoughts with these metaphors and synonyms
I shoot game through the sky at amazing speeds
Helping the industry curve at the time of need[Styles P]
Knee-deep in the game
Due time you'll see the sunshine if you sleep in the rain
I ain't tryin to weather the storm
I get over the clouds and I ain't talkin 'bout flyin a plane
I'm in the slums where the guns is
Niggas sell crack to get hundreds - I mean thousands
I seen European cars by housing
I seen shinin on your block, I'm just browsin
Fo'-five make you get free
My London niggas say, "You get me?" I say, "I got you"
Rude boy, they better watch you
Too hot to handle, too cold to hold
When I was young they used to say I had a older soul
Only death can make the soldiers fold
Comin down, hit the floor, let go, all my soldiers roll
You get hit then your soul let go, let's go

[Hook: Max B]
(Let's go) We pop shots off at your bean
D-Block, Byrd Gang, that's the team (team team)
Big fifth make you move back
Go against them, you don't really wanna do that
Them got that yay.. it's a holiday (holiday baby)
If you fuck with my money then you might as well pay

[Styles P]
Handgun and the rifle
And a knife too, shit just that trifle
Get blood from your ice to your Nike boots
Head cracked like the dice do
I don't squeal nor squeak like the mice do
I get hype too, come through the block and light you
Like a cigarette, you ain't seen a harder nigga yet
Hit you like a Nicorette
Off a lion nigga pick a pet, I mean pick a beast
I run the city nigga pick a street
Matter fact you could pick a beef
I'm old school we can shoot it out, pick a heat
Fuck you!

[Hook]

[Styles P]
I get ya, get the picture?
I'm the painter, you the painted
Talkin shit when you ain't shit
I'm five-star, you ain't ranked kid
I'm major, fuck the majors, fuck the label
And take that to the bank kid
It's the Ghost or the Phantom
Killin rappers at random without a handgun, can't stand him
I'm too nice, I'm too hot
You don't wanna drop from the top of the rooftop
Turn the mic up, turn the beat up
S.P. the Ghost still keep the fuckin booth hot

[Hook][Intro: Akon]
This an invasion

[Intro]
Yeah Niggas!
This is an invasion!
Hood Rules Apply Volume 2, and we invading this bitch!
This is not just mixtapes, this a motherfucking movement!
(I think I got that on on this one, hahaha.)

[Verse 1: Akon]
This goes out to them clowns
Talk about they got the block locked down
Sewing up the compound
Only if you knew how my squad get down
Think you met a bad man walking
You ain't met a bad man 'till you walked up on me
Hit you with the Glock two times
Fucking up my shoe shine once you drop down
See, niggas ain't got no dough
Fakin' like they wanna be loco
I see you jacking my jewels
I ain't the one you wanna stand next to

[Hook: Akon]
Think you met a bad man walkin'
You ain't met a bad man 'till you walked up on me
This an invasion
Don't give a fuck, black, red, caucasian

[Verse 2: Team Invasion Member]
Yo, yo, yo
Between you and I
Here's the truth; no lie
You gon' die for the fact that hood rules apply
I hold my ruger high
Before I shoot the sky
Shoot your alla(?), shoot your father
Haze got me super high
My team moving pies
My team move and rise
Clutching them 45's
Fuck with us it's suicide
And you can crucify. (bad nigga)
Green got us flying G4's
Commercial's how we used to fly
I dare you to try
And test the evil genius (yeah)
We got a crew and I, we a bunch of trigger squeezers (Invasion)
They call us nigga bleeders, we make niggas bleed
We can't get at you, shit we kidnap your seed
And that's the hood rules
So beef in your streets with my heat
Ain't no telling what I could do
Who write the crook rules?
This is for the mixtape niggas in the streets making shook moves

[Verse 3: Akon]
I ain't gon' tell you no lie
See them hood rules do apply
If you choose not to abide
Guarantee you will see a grown man cry
Think you met a bad man walking
You ain't met a bad man 'till you walked up on me
Think you been slidin', bring more grief than the nigga Bin Laden. (Invasion!)
Cause we on the block all day
Some cook, some moving that Yay
Gotta get that pay, stick up kids trying to stomp that brake
Think you seen a bad man walking
You ain't met a bad man 'till you walked up on me
Keep a double deuce on hand
You don't lose that dance (?)
Keep it under that sandal

[Verse 4: Team Invasion Member]
I got my nose in the hood like coke on the table
Go against my rule, get a slug in your naval
Even my brother can get it too, like Cain and Abel
Times are hard and the rent's still due
So by any means nigga, your ass is expendable
Hoes ain't a friend to me, they just my enemies
I only got love for dollar bills and Hennessy
Most niggas ain't worthy of a slug or a knife
So I pistol whip them to induce blunt trauma
With the chrome llama. I learned a lot from them old-timers
The game of life is more like blood sport
That's why a lot of niggas done died on the court
Rule 73: Keep your gun oiled and clean
Just to be the last man standing at the crime scene:
Heart beatin' crazy, cold sweatin', cause you made it
Now make ya escape with the toast and the cake

[Hook][Busta Rhymes]
You know, my homey Treach from Naughty By Nature once said
If you ain't from the ghetto, don't come to the fucking ghetto
But I'mma let one of our most immaculate tour guides
Take us all through the ghetto - my nigga Rick James!

[Rick James - sampled from "Ghetto Life"] + (backup singers)
When I was a young boy, growing up in the ghetto!
Hanging out on corners, singing with the fellas
Looking for the cute chicks, trying to find me big fun
Looking for some trouble, or anyone who'll give me some
I was young and crazy! (In the ghetto)
Didn't know what my life would be (In the ghetto)
I was dumb and oh so lazy (In the ghetto)
Something had a spell on me (In the ghetto)
You all know what I'm talking about (Talking about ghetto life)
(Talking about ghetto life)
You all know what I'm singing about (Talking about ghetto life)
Ghetto life (Talking about ghetto life)

[Busta Rhymes]
(In the ghetto) Sure we be taking them chances
While we search for the answers we be smoking them cancer sticks
Police provoking motherfuckers we dancing
And we be dodging them bullets they be popping off at us, shit
But yet we always romance the street
And fall in love with the hood until somebody come blast the heat
Always up to no good, so all of my fam could eat
See in the hood we hungry - hey nigga we playing for keeps
My soldiers on the block get on it
It be good if you flaunt it, we will take if we want it
See niggas from the ghetto got a different state of mind
With a different kind of hustle and we iller with the grind
And develop our muscle until we sicker with the shine
In the struggle, thus our money come quicker doing crime
I see the way we rep the hood, gotta love me
You can take me out the ghetto, but you can't take it from me
Gotta love it

[Hook: Rick James] + (backup singers)
(Talkin about ghetto life)
Ghetto life (Talking about ghetto life)
You all know what I'm singing about (Talkin about ghetto life)
Ghetto life (Talking about ghetto life)

[Busta Rhymes]
(In the ghetto) That's where we get into that street shit
Hustle hard, try to get money quick (In the ghetto)
That's where I got my name from
I learned to get money and I got all my game from (In the ghetto)
That's where you eat with a bunch of the wolves
And get to hustling as hard as you could (In the ghetto)
Until your cake stacking shit'll get good
Throw a block party for the whole hood (In the ghetto)
With them burnout cellys
Talk crazy, sell drugs in front of Pancho Deli
Crackhead chicks still smuggle babies in they belly
And then piss in elevators 'til the lobby all smelly (In the ghetto)
That's where I keep my ratchets
Get my instincts and survival tactics
Ain't nothing like the hood nigga, I don't care
You surviving in the ghetto you can make it anywhere
Gotta love it

[Hook]

[Interlude: Busta Rhymes]
To my East coast niggas - rep your ghetto
West coast niggas - rep your ghetto
Midwest niggas - rep your ghetto
Down South niggas - rep your ghetto
To my East coast niggas - rep your ghetto
West coast niggas - rep your ghetto
Midwest niggas - rep your ghetto
To my Dirty South niggas - rep your ghetto

[Busta Rhymes]
(In the ghetto) Even though they act rude
You'll always find a good chick to hold a brick for they dude
Behind the bullshit, me and my clique on the move
We honor the code of the street, and live by the rules (In the ghetto)
Is where, all of the hood's at
Find the most crooks and they sell the most drugs at
Where you find beautiful women and rugrats
And some of the most powerful people, I love that!
Come mon
