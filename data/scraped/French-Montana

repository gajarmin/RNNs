They've been lookin' at the Gram, I've been lookin' at the Grammys
Like, huh, that's us right now
24/7, 365 days, everybody gettin' paid
Niggas lookin' at me like I'm worth both MJs
People saying, "Ye, Ye, take it easy"
20 Gs for the Yeezys off of eBay
Niggas do the most and they ain't done shit
Only way I can sum it up, sumbitch

Oh me, oh my my (Haan! Off the rip)
Gon' need more quinine (Aye aye aye)

[Bridge: French Montana]
I'ma ride with my dog off the rip
Talking brown bag, paper tag off the rip
Shawty came through, bent it over off the rip
Dope boy back, popping tags off the rip, nigga off the rip
Started from the block, dirty money off the rip
Cut a shark fin, talking money off the rip
Walk up on the dealer, a hundred fifty off the rip
My dog came home, buck fifty off the rip
Haan!

[Hook: Chinx Drugz & (French Montana)]
Oh me, oh my my

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Rarri looking good on the strip
Talking a hundred mill as I mothafucking grip
Johnny Hancock, ten milli off the rip
Shawty bought her friends off the rip
Bitch bust it open, eating pussy off the rip
Westside, getting blood money with a crip
My dog getting out, money orders off the rip, boy
Spend a car note on my fit, boy
Manute Bol hanging off my clip, boy
Niggas running like a skit, boy
I'll push you on my skit, boy
On my wrist is a brick, boy
Built the empire brick by brick, boy
Coke Boys off the rip, boy

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chinx Drugz]
Coke Boys get the bloody money, dirty cash
Live niggas who smoke weed, car seat stashed
You monkey walk, I'm hunchbacked, speak quiet
Talking 'bout mi casa, scared to death when I pop up

[Bridge + Hook]

[Verse 3: French Montana]
Started with a hooptie and I went and got a Beamer
Pull up in a boat, titanic La Marina
Shout out to young gunner, spend a hundred on my timer
Looking through the smoke and mirrors, smoking marijuana
Rarri and the Gatti and the Beamers and the Benzes
Homicide china, yeah my door off the hinges
Riding with some cubans that be fresh up out that border
Making back a whole thang, breaking down a quarter
Drophead, getting dome, riding through New Orleans
Hear them shots ringing then I hit that money caller
Counting up my blessings, counting money keep a dollar
Drophead white mink on when it's cold Out

[Hook x2]

[Verse 4: N.O.R.E.]
Coke Boys get the coke money, plenty cash
Live niggas just smoke ash, Phantom seat stashed
You donkey walk, I'm hunchbacked, buck quiet
Talking 'bout mi casa, you TMZ niggas gossip

[Outro: French Montana]
Off the rip, off the rip
Off the mothafucking rip, boy[Hook: Jeremih]
Got a good thing goin' with a bad bitch
You know who to call when you need it
Wish I had another you, I'm greedy
Sometimes like that nigga get greedy
Got damn I fell in love with a bad bitch
You know that every time you leave me
Even though I know how men be talkin'
I just know that nigga wanna be me
Came in here and fell in love with a bad bitch
Back then she ain't have shit
Now she grown up, she got ass, tits
Wanna know where she got that ass at
She hit my heart, a toot, toot on it
She got a dump truck, I put a boot on it
Don't mind spendin' this loot on it
Treat her like my whip, I put some shoes on her

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Got a dump truck, put a boot on her
I don't mind trickin', spendin' loot on her
Walk up in the club, and toot, toot on her
She's a bad bitch, put shoes on her
God damn, fell in love with a bad bitch
Said, "French, take me to Paris"
Dominican mami from Cali
I said, "Gon' bend it over, let me grab it"
I said, "Gon' bend it over, make it nasty"
Walked up in the club, rollin', Stevie Wonder glasses
I ain't lookin' at you niggas, lookin' way past you
Young, fly, G's up, pocket full of cash
You know where to find me, you know when you need me
All my dogs eat, they'll tell you I ain't greedy
I ain't gon' love her, too much to leave her
I ain't goin' public, surely is easy

[Hook]

[Verse 2: French Montana & Jeremih]
Pull up with my niggas, make a move
Red light, green light, no it ain't Gucci
Used to walk up in the store, couldn't afford that
Now I walk up in the store, buyin' all that
Drink it to the head, man, nigga feelin' woozy
Pull up in the old school, boy I'm on some new shit
Red to the head, man we gettin' all that
And shorty phone answers, she don't ever call back
And I can see why these niggas hate me
Pull up in a drop and the watch 80
Pull up to the front but a nigga faded
Got a new crib and the shit gated
Came from the bottom, watch a nigga ball out
Drink it to the head, smoke 'til you fall out
Countin' up this money, nigga, keep the door locked
All my niggas gettin' to this money, no lie

[Hook][Produced by Southside, 808 mafia & DJ Spinz]

[Intro: Travi$ Scott]
I just got back from the hmm
I told her be back soon
I don’t really wanna go
(Migos!)

[Hook: Chris Brown]
I told her hold it down
She fucking with the plug, told her “come over now"
Where are all my bitches tonight?
Bring me some more bitches tonight
Yeah, I bought a hunnid rounds
She asking for fifty, threw a hunnid thou
Where are all my bitches tonight?
Bring me some more bitches tonight
Yeah, I’m feeling like Moses
I’m all in the ocean, I’m parting, divided up in it like Moses
She switching the motions and making them faces just like an emoji
Pineapple Fanta, it mixed with the Xanax, she loving the codeine
All of my killas, they ready to follow me, I feel like Moses

[Bridge 1: French Montana & (Chris Brown)]
Got a hunnid bitches with me, feel like (Moses)
Got a hunnid killas with me, feel like (I feel like Moses)
I got a yacht on the water, feel like
Got a hunnid bad bitches, feel like (Moses)

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Feeling like Kobe, sipping and drinking, I'm feeling like Kobe
Sipping and drinking, that yellow and purple, I'm mixing that codeine
Look at the top of my Audemar, look at them bitches, they wall to wall
Look at my niggas they all in, you know them niggas don't call a lot
Look at the Benz, look at them niggas, they looking depressed
Came with her friends, throwing them bags, that Mitchell & Ness
Young cold nigga, mouth full of gold teeth
Fuck nigga talking 'bout nigga? You don’t know me, huh

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Look at the presi', fuck with the Rollie and move like the president
This shit depressing, feeling like Moses, I'm giving them lessons
Skinny, tatted with the blue hair and the gold teeth
I don’t run from woop woop, shit fuck the police

[Hook]

[Bridge 2: Quavo & (Chris Brown)]
What you feel like (Moses)
What you feel like? (I feel like Moses)
What you feel like? Uhh, yeah (Moses)

[Verse 3: Quavo]
(Quavo!)
Feeling like Moses, pipe with the water, I cause a commotion
Lil' mama said she wet, she wetter than an ocean
I pull up on you, rub up on you like some lotion
You might call me Sniper way a nigga scoping

[Verse 4: Offset]
(Offset!)
When she get on her knees it’s for numbers
When it come to trapping I give you the formula
Cuban links hang on my neck like the ornament
Fuck on your bitch, I give her back, don’t want the bitch

[Verse 5: Takeoff]
(Takeoff!)
Grabbing it fast shit it’s magic
Two snow bunnies call ‘em Mary Kate & Ashley
Keep it on me, quick to shoot a three
Like Dirk Nowitzki from the Dallas Mavericks

[Verse 6: Quavo]
(Quavo!)
She said she wanna fuck with a real nigga
She said she wanna go to war and kill with him
50 bottles in the VIP, 50 models
Momma told me watch for the snakes and koalas

[Hook] + [Bridge 2][Hook]
I ride for my niggas, dawg, I ride for my niggas
I slide for my niggas, dawg, I ride for my niggas, dawg
(Stay schemin', niggas tryna get at me, dawg)
I ride for my niggas

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Damn, life's so short
Fuck, I don't wanna go to court
Fuck it, got a budget for the lawyer, though
Fuck it, I’m on the run for the money
I’m in the bucket, paid 200 for it
My lil niggas thuggin’, even got me paranoid
I’m gettin money, that's in any nigga category
Double M, I got G’s out in California

[Hook]

(Young Frankie Geechi Liberace)

[Verse 2: Drake]
It bothers me when the gods get to acting like the broads
Guess every team doesn’t come complete with niggas like ours
That's why I see no need to compete with niggas like y’all
I just ask that when you see me you speak up, nigga, that's all
Don’t be ducking like you never wanted nothing
It's feeling like rap changed, it was a time it was rugged
Back when if a nigga reached it was for the weapon
Nowadays niggas reach just to sell they record
Spaghetti bolognese in the Polo Lounge
Me and my G from DC that's how I roll around
Might look light, but we heavy though
You think Drake will pull some shit like that? You never know
Million dollar meetings in a Polo Lounge
Me and my man Oliver North that's how I roll around
Shawty wanna tell me secrets 'bout a rap nigga
I tell that bitch it's more attractive when you hold it down
Kobe 'bout to lose a hundred fifty M’s
Kobe my nigga I hate it had to be him
Bitch you wasn't with me shooting in the gym
(Bitch you wasn't with me shooting in the gym)
Tell Lucian I said "fuck it", I’m tearing holes in my budget
Bag her like we in Publix and take her ass out in public
Ordered her the filet, told 'em butterfly it, she’ll love it
She used to soda and nuggets, she really just out here thuggin'
I'm just hittin my pinnacle, you and pussy identical
You like the fucking finish line, we can’t wait to run into you
But let me get my mind off that
Young rich motherfucker getting mine off rap with my niggas

[Hook]

[Verse 3: French Montana]
From the hoopty coupe to that Ghost, dog
Pigeons on the roof like Ghost Dog
Dwight Howard on the post, dog
My niggas got the powder through the post, dog
Watch the body tilt when you hit the head
Niggas lost mills tryna beat the Feds
10 grams off my last 250 now
Big ass crib, 250 down, damn
Gave my nigga Max 7-5
Then gave my nigga Penthouse another 30
Fuck it, got me thinking like I'm 7-5
Damn, nigga ain't even seen 30

[Hook][Verse 1: French Montana]
Take her phone and her ID
C-C-Can't post me on IG
Know them thots they be creeping
Tryna catch a selfie while I'm sleeping
Go to far you need a passport
See them shots coming got a glass quart
Thots try to camcord
That's a long shot I'm shootin from half court

[Chorus: Wash]
Can't trust thots
Soon as them bottles start coming out (thots)
Then she come running to my car (thots)
She'll leave your ass never trust a big butt and a smile
And you can't trust thots
Soon as the liquor start running out (thots)
She'll be creeping to another couch (thots)
She'll leave your ass never trust a big butt and a smile

[Verse 2: Wash]
A thot is a girl that look for bottles
As soon as she come in the club
You can find her at my table flirting with the ballers
Tryna go for a cup
Crazy part shorty bad as fuck
Doing squats all day working on her butt
She know that'll make a nigga go nuts
That's what she want

[Bridge: Wash]
She ain't tryna pay for anything if anything
She tryna get a wedding ring
But me and my niggas ain't no cuffing no nothing
And her favorite thing to hear a dude say is
You might get a pair of nice shoes and a bag
Money ain't nothing baby I'll spend it fast on you
Baby I'll spend it fast on you

[Chorus: Wash]
That's when I found out that you can't trust thots
Soon as them bottles start coming out (thots)
Then she come running to my car (thots)
She'll leave your ass never trust a big butt and a smile
And you can't trust thots
Soon as the liquor start running out (thots)
She'll be creeping to another couch (thots)
She'll leave your ass never trust a big butt and a smile

[Verse 3: Wash]
A thot is a girl that look for sparkles
As soon as she come in the club
You can spot her up at the bar until she see them lights
Then she coming on over here with us
Ain't no shame in her game
She bring her friends too and
They be tryna act like they not with her
But they be drinking too

[Bridge: Wash]
She ain't tryna pay for anything if anything
She tryna get a wedding ring
But me and my niggas ain't no cuffing no nothing
And her favorite thing to hear a dude say is
You might get a pair of nice shoes and a bag
Money ain't nothing baby I'll spend it fast on you
Baby I'll spend it fast on you

[Chorus: Wash]
That's when I found out that you can't trust thots
Soon as them bottles start coming out (thots)
Then she come running to my car (thots)
She'll leave your ass never trust a big butt and a smile
And you can't trust thots
Soon as the liquor start running out (thots)
She'll be creeping to another couch (thots)
She'll leave your ass never trust a big butt and a smile

[Verse 4: French Montana]
(Thots be like) I need nice shoes and a bag
Need a dough boy with it bad
(Thots be like) I got the best pussy and the best head
Need my boobs and my ass did
(Thots be like) I know you got smoke and some drink
Tonight I'm goin hard in the paint
(Thots be like) If you love me like he say he did
He'll move me where he say he live

[Chorus: Wash]
You can't trust thots
Soon as them bottles start coming out (thots)
Then she come running to my car (thots)
She'll leave your ass never trust a big butt and a smile
And you can't trust thots
Soon as the liquor start running out (thots)
She'll be creeping to another couch (thots)
She'll leave your ass never trust a big butt and a smile

[Outro]
Can't trust thots[Skit]
Well in just about 15 seconds from now, it'll be 1990. We're gathered down below as we say goodbye to 1989. The ball is moving, the crowd sees it, you can hear 'em. Oh, can you ever hear 'em. They know when it hits the bottom it'll be 1990; goodbye to the 80's. (10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1! Happy new year!

[Intro: Fabolous & (French Montana)]
Whoa, whoa, whoa (x7)
(Haan, change is good for everybody)
Montana, Dre fitted it, haan)

[Bridge: French Montana]
When that hate don't work they start telling lies
Baby work, go on bust it wide
It's that new money, let the drawers drop
I cut my bitch off when the ball drop

[Refrain: Fabolous & French Montana]
Haan
(Whoa whoa whoa) (x4)
I just don't know why

[Hook: Fabolous & French Montana]
Hating hoes ain't happy
And happy hoes ain't hatin'
Better check the situation
I could fix your situation
Whoa whoa whoa (x2)
I cut them bitches off when the ball drop
New year, new money, then the call dropped
(New year, new money, let them drawers drop)
Cut them niggas off when the ball drop
Cause them real niggas ain't haters
And them hatin' niggas ain't real
And baby I could help your situation
No top, smokin' medication

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
This the new year resolution
We gotta be the winners cause the rest is losin'
I told em get money, that's the best solution
When you do, wear your rocket like you rest in Houston
When niggas stole my style, I ain't stress the boostin'
It's time to make more money, less excuses
My old bitch on death row, it's time for execution
My new bitch is bad ass, she the best since Boosie

[Hook]

[Verse 2: French Montana]
12 o' clock then the call dropped
Cut them niggas off when the ball drop
Young boy, hard head in the soft top
Cause when them shots ain't ringin' ,you can't call shots
Mix some white and brown on the corner strap
Might be the next Mike Brown where you rollin' at
V with hundred on the Lincoln
3 quarter mink blew the top off Lincoln, God
Niggas scared to play it like jail or Richard Mellor
I hope I never Tom Heller, God
Scramble like a dope fiend (dope fiend)
Keep your head up like your nose bleedin'
My right hand got 30 on his left arm
On that left lane nigga, what a bitch for?
I just don't know why

[Bridge] + [Refrain] + [Hook]

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Cuttin' off hoes when the ball drop
Ridin' with my woes til' the casket drop
Quiet 'fore you suckas hear a pin drop
I buy this mother fucker like the price drop
Shawty bag it up, let that ass drop
Mommy killin' em, tat tear drop
Bitch I'm on fire, need to stop drop
Nigga this the flow that got your artist dropped
Heard he was a rat, heard he dime dropped
Hit em in the head, watch the body drop
Dollars coming down like rain drops
New year, new money, nigga ball drop

[Hook][Intro]
I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they're strong, but my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms without falling to your feet
But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true

[Hook]
Promise always keep 100 strapped with 100 clips
Started from 100 dollars, tryna make 100 Ms
Lost 100 niggas, bought about 100 whips
Made about 100 visits, sent about 100 flicks
100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100 100

[Verse 1: Cheeze]
Your new mixtape, sour we break up on
Put that mac in his face, no make up on
Home invasions, your mouth we puttin tape upon
Blades through your forehead, no shape up on
Yeah, it's Cheeze, I'm the one that get my cakin' on
In the kitchen, pie flippin' with my apron on
I gotta have patience, but they taking long
They ain't got no cool, nigga breakin' on
100 bottles, 100 bitches
2 O's, 100 Swishers
Million dollar dream, blue dream wishes
Ice shining, tryna scheme with your misses

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chinx Drugz]
Took took took the game by surprise, they ain't see us coming
See they tracks in the sand, got these suckers running
Fresh off this life from poverty, board that money train
Put 100 on your head, you can keep the change
I lost 100 niggas, gained zero friends
I'm six zeroes in, feel like I never came to win
Some call it ungrateful, I call it overdue
Double styrofoam cup with that purple juice
Leanin', big money schemin'
Dump tell stack I said what up, fuck 'em, I ain't lettin' up
Got the game by the testicals, gun range tested
SKs and the 50 Cals, quiet but my jewerly loud
My money went from Spud Webb to Manute Bol
I'm ballin' hot, these niggas luke cold
They don't want the money, that's why they run from it
If you a stand up nigga, then keep it 100

[Hook]

[Verse 3: French Montana]
My niggas put in work, shawty held me down
Hustlin paid the bills, karma came around
That fast money came, nigga, then I lost touch
When it sounds too good, nigga, I never trust it
From crabs in the bucket to them lobster tails
From the block to trynna get Madonna sales
They got keys from west, to hittin Key West
Thats a motherfucker, Delonte West
Gettin high off moll nigga, fuck niggas lame
Thats a hundred thou, trynna fix the pain
Niggas stole our style, trynna switch the game
Hoppin' out the shower, throw on a hundred chain[Verse 1: French Montana]

Homie, I just lost my only paper, back to square one
Feel like misery is my only neighbor
They say God protect us
I don't know why I feel safer with a burner
Getting high got me locked up in the prison
Smelling like last night
Why people sell their soul for the fast life?
Nobody loves it
And they tell us go fight for the flag, but don't fight for them colors
Watch some television, have you baptized and your brain washed
What to wear, where to live, what to do when a friend is a friend with a motive
Them broke plans'll have a nigga down, feeling hopeless
Hoping I can make mils before I lay on my back
On the block where a million niggas flipping packs
Grabbing my leg
Feel like crabs in the bucket, can't get ahead

[Hook: Big KRIT]

Cause either niggas waiting on ya
Or they hating on ya
Tell 'em I ain't falling off never
That chopper say that they don't want it
I put some money on it
I'm a be coldest motherfucker ever

Cause either you a made man
Or your game plan
Trying to make that kind of money that don't exchange hands
You the pimp type, or you ho'n out
Motherfuckers know exactly what I'm talking about

[Verse 2: Curren$y]

Too much going on to think about
Old school Camero like the new ones never dropped
Bitch waving while I'm swinging but I can't stop
Like that green
Bitch, we always got the green light, what you mean?
I go where I please
Ho like, "don't leave" but baby, I'm in the breeze
Money don't grow on them, but I for sure smoke on them
Cadillac with the Ritz with the true spokes on them
Slabs, whatever you want, we have
Slinging like the rock fired by David and Goliath
Word rhyming Heisman
Joe Namath with my fur coat, sidelining
I bought Rolex watches for all of my offensive linemen
Because it's time to make it happen
Audio dope boy magic
Burning through the plastic, touchdown passes
Flicking fleas off like ashes

[Hook: Big KRIT]

[Verse 3: Smoke DZA]

Riiiiight
Niggas acting funny on the daily, spare me
I be indifferent to most shit, sincerely
Not a fuck given in my body, sorry
Try to hit me with that old school game, Atari
Leave them like Lawry's, nigga, saucy as shit
You know the type, bad bite
But when they see you, straight hop on your dick
I'm like "are these niggas stupid or nah?"
Rhetorical questions as I puff on my 'gar
Ain't heard from my homie in weeks, he in the hole
When I get that unavailable call I already know
And as soon as a nigga press 5
He hit me with a "riiiiight"
I be hyped, daddy, keeping spirits alive
Said he heard me on the radio the whole building was live
He like "Nigga, I won't see daylight soon
But as long as you shining bro, I'll be cool."

[Hook: Big KRIT][Hook: French Montana]
Money ain't everything nigga it's the only thing
I pop bottles like I got 40 rings
40 cars, 40 chains, 40 bitches
I got 40 names
A, K, K, K, K, K
Karma, drama, never been to college
Think about the feds homie, that'll be the only thing
40 cars, 40 chains

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Bust, bust it, what the business is?
Cars, cribs, couple businesses
Lean, Percs and them blacks
Been to hell and back
Then I cut off my rearview, cause I ain't looking back
Now my bad bitch neck tatted, blue dye my bladder
Rip it off that rack boy, what it cost don't matter
I say starin' down and I'm in it
Trap money I'm spending
PG for that dream team, you fucking right we winning
40, 40, another 40 boy
They ask me why I sell, feel that YSL?
Drunk in the front, your bitch in the back
I land in the front, and I start from the back

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Hop out the jet, what city is this?
3 bitches in bed, I'm like who's titty is this?
They fucked around and let a nigga like me get rich
I don't know another nigga like me exist
These girls be 'bout that YOLO life
I ask you now if you a ho, no right?
But my dick's still meeting with your throat tonight
Pimp game strong, cold as ice
Told em I'd show you right
You pay for pussy, you know the price
That's hard to handle, this life a gamble
I want the dice, minute rice
To business life, I'm an enterprise
And I'll drop whatever on whatever you ain't finna buy
Live every moment like my last, like I'm finna die
Know I sing it now wonder will I sing it when I'm in the sky

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Fabulous]
Bust it, bust it, she let that 40 flame
My AKA is what shorty name
Just call my crew the Rolex and Audi gang
But we still got no time for these lames
I'm with my Mexican homies out of Juárez
They'll hook you up, give you a chorus
We campaigning like we running for pres
Still watching out for JC and Torres
New York undercovers amongst the others
The family be couple hundred of us
Got a hundred brothers, AKA the Jacksons
Got a hundred sisters, AKA the Braxtons

Burn the roof off this muhhfucka like I got fifty stoves in my whip bitch 
We all smoking and driving

Might as well call me the pilot
Bitches in my cockpit I don’t check mileage
I just fuck my ho like I’m 'sposed to
And when she bring her friends I fuck both
I brought the bitch to thanksgiving
Why?
Cus she fucks with me when I’m broke
Ain't nothing funny about the way I get money
And them Cleveland boys ain't no joke
I’m the truth and the truth is hard to swallow
So you better tell these bitches don’t choke, echo
I got one bitch, I got two bitch, I got three bitch, I got four
I tell the fifth bitch to tell sixth bitch to get the seventh bitch to bring mo'. 
Ain't no hand cuffin cousin
That bitch ain't on parole
And pimpin ain't easy pimp but pimpin's all that I know, god damn 

[Hook: Machine Gun Kelly]

Diamonds shining rocky ASAP
I told them I be pimpin on them bitches 
You can call me pimping ken
I fuck em once and tell em go and bring a friend 
She ain't seen a real nigga ball in a minute

White Maybach no roof in the ceiling
When I take em to the crib all the bad bitches with it

On my nose a bandanna, on my neck is a Phantom
All my hoes from Atlanta, all my dogs in the slammer
Talk to Death Row, talk to Tony Montana
Bitch talk on the low, screamin' Frenchie Montana
Time to fill up your head, Henny, fuck that Moët
Fall asleep in the east, wake me up on the west
Shawty calling me dada, aw no mommy no, no
Throwing up in the Audi after fistin' and menage

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Straight up, in that jeep, can't wait up
He ain't say who he say he is, he an actor, he play tough
I just copped me a Rollie, okay I lied, cuz I took it
Do a show in a valley, I tell 'em boys to go book
Fresh out my city, I'm shootin', land in my city, I'm coolin'
Bunch of niggas smokin' Tooka, ride with guns in a Uber
I get caught, I can't go, my lawyer fresh from Jerusalem
Audi R8 logo look like 4 kids hoola hoopin'

[Hook][French Montana]
Hah!
Cuz I don’t know what they totin
You niggas smokin that Lamar Odom

I be 88 stories off the floor high
You need the Phantom Rolls
Flippin work, comin back like Derrick Rose
Don’t call me, I’mma call you
Sicily, bread, olive oil
Stop beggin nigga I don’t owe you
And once you cross the line nigga I don’t know you
Make about quarter mill a week
Man that closet like Fashion Week
Slingin drugs, dealers got the package
I still make Salah 5 times a day
Tryna send mama to Mecca
While a nigga snortin pound with the liquor
Man watch for the stick up, (prrrp)
G-O-D GOD flow
Don Juan de Marco, lot like car show
Feel for ya, nobody to kill for ya
Wanna tell ya story but guys won’t bear with you
And nah, I ain’t tryna get bread wit you
So go and tell yo bitch to split the bill wit you
I'm countin commas, young die with honor
Turks and Caicos, still smoking marijuana
Corner block was ya boy owe us
Young boy shooter like Jamal Crawford
Bricks in the basement, givin niggas spaces
Clips in the Matrix, slid with the waitress
5 stars tell em, said she 16
Now that’s R. Kelly, my niggas war ready
Gifted and cursed, next step could be the worse
Next coupe could be ya hearse
Man this shit hard when it hurt though
My niggas slingin hard in front of church doors
Man slingin hard was the first tour
Now it's H. Fraud on a surf board
I be clean as a whistle
Team is official
Black and white diamonds, all I need is a whistle

[Jadakiss]
My weed is the issue
Now may I proceed to kiss you?
They put you where both of yall single men
Home-made speaker outta the Pringle can
Can’t wait to do your thing again
When they mention your name the bells ring again
Gettin that cake, it cause friction
They love turn that hate to addiction
Mind thinker but echo prescriptions
Up in the presidential suite with a vixen
A lot of suckers in the bizz
Good die young, sucka niggas live
Quickest way to go, fuckin with the kids
He ain’t gon stop til you pluck him with the SIG
Lost 100 thou, fuckin with the Knicks
Flyin on a brukler, bucket full of bricks
Last night club, fuck it, where the bitch
Cuz money in the field but I fuckin with the 6
Words of advice, run through the game
Niggas know the hood run through my veins
Real subtle with great poise
Pure bundles, a straight boy
Smoke loud, make noise
Dream Team, Wraith Boys
RIP Darry D and Nutty aka Troy

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Dirty Money give me dirty looks
Spend a day with us, you can write 30 books
Bought a mansion off 30 hooks
Greenhouse, 30 bottles, 30 crooks
I made a mill, I fucked it up

Damn right I hit that, brown bag we wit that
Money loose, we dread that, you just got it, I did that
Hopping out that Aston, top off like Cassie

She go bussin it open for free, good you pay the piper
2012 Jay Erving

[Hook]

[Verses 3: Cheeze]
I'm ridin round with that dezzy, bubbling like Pepsi

Black bag with that back, I'm ridin round with that hefty
My man coming through to shoot it and I ain't talking bout hefty
Coke Boys, leave 'em right, ice all on my lefty
I'm getting money, fuck em all, they ain't got to accept me

Sour haze I'm blazing on I wave it just like a jet ski

[Verses 3: Charlie Rock]

Got me and new lloyd get paid a hundred a coda
And a new bad bitch get paid in ricoda
Off 2 cups of that lean, quarter pound of that loud
Mad work on the table maybe get ride for the crack

[Intro: Que]
9 time out of 10 I’m probably fuckin' with some hoes

Walk in side the booty club, I’m pickin’ any one I want
9 times out of 10 I’m probably fuckin' with some hoes

[Hook: Que]
9 time out of 10 I’m probably fuckin' with some hoes

With a bank account that most niggas would kill for
Stupid retarded crib, and all my whips clean
Rockin' some Jays that don’t come out til 2015
I’m moonwalking bitch, yeah, I’m Michael Jackson +Thriller+ fresh
Slipped inside the +Mirror+, saw a pimp nigga in the flesh
Spray some Polo cologne, to match my Polo socks
Now Coke bottle bitches, make your soda pop
And drop it like I ain't ever seen you drop it before ho
Drop it for a legend or this DTP logo
Drop it for a little free marketing and promo
And let me Instagram this photo

[Hook]

[Ludacris]
Scrolling through my Ho-lodex
Eenie Meenie Miney Mo, let’s see what ho is next
So many to choose from, I can’t make up my mind
But whoever I pick better get up on the dick real quick, don’t waste my time
Cause I got shit to do, so I’m just bout to smash
Soon as I’m through with you, back to countin’ this cash
I’m hung low to all these women, I’m their antidote
And when they on my dick look like they riding a banana boat
But on they period, I don’t want them mislead
So it’s a sign by my bed that say “No turn on red”
Treating women like spades, I’m so unstoppable
Just tying to leave the club with 'bout 3 and I’m possible

[Hook]

[French Montana]
Luda! Hahhh
(Whattup French? Holla at 'em)

Coke Boys in the house, that cost a house
Disturbing The Peace, smoking that loud
Throw up 50 like nothin’ cause bitch I’m worth 20 Ms
Brick throwing got your bitch jumping like Shawn Kemp
Got a neck full of gold, fresh out the 'lympics (bling)
Stack never fold, pussy clap on the pole
Louis tax counting mills, Louis on that field
Coming fresh out the corner, now he on that hill
With your, bitch, blowin', smoke, nigga
I ain’t, gang, bangin', but Luda, that’s my, folk, nigga
9 times out of ten, house money I spend
Take your bitch and her friends, MONTANA!

[Hook][Intro: DJ Kay Slay]
Ay yo, it's DJ Kay Slay, the drama king
So this is what it comes down to, huh?
Y'all niggas think y'all 'bout that life?
Well it's time to show and prove
Fab, set it off!

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Look, I terminate a bitch, like her name was Sarah Connor
Where I'm from, we never meet daddies; swear on mommas
I'm high fashion, so my Gucci reeks of marijuana
My shoes are killing them! I call these a pair of homi-cides
Put me in the passenger and I'mma ride, cause my mind is full of massacres
Killer verses, I lay 'em down and fill up hearses
You can't be the best without knowing who the worst is
Me and Kay a lot alike, we don't fake nothing
Thick bitches in my sheets, I be straight stunting
You got the wrong keys, I ain't who to start with
Rise of the apes, now who you monkeys getting smart with?

[Hook: T-Pain]
I'm bout that money, I'm bout that fetty
I'm down to get it by any means necessary
I'm bout that drama, I'm bout that strife
Now fuck with me or with my team and you gonna see
Bi-bi-bi-bitch I'm bout that life!
I-I-I'm go-going hard, go-going in
Tryna get what I can get before these people give me 25 to life
Now tell them hatin' ass niggas, that hatin' only makes you die quicker
Cause bitch I'm bout that life!

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
In love with the money, infatuated with coupes
Immaculate living, money stack up to my roof
The baddest of women, purse matchin' the boots
That's the half, you don't wanna see what's in that fuckin' bag
Pull it like a flip cam, first you aim it, then you fire
Penthouse smoker, nigga, I can't get no higher
Hella bad heroine in every bag she carry "O."
You niggas ain't getting money, fuck it and carry on
The biggest and the richest, fucking self made
Ricky Rozay and my nigga Kay Slay
Pound of purple green, 2 liter of pink Sprite.
I could flip a brick before a chick can blink twice!

[Hook: T-Pain]

[Verse 3: Nelly]
You know what? You don't like me, I don't give a fuck
Respect is like some money to me, I don't get enough!
Like I ain't put on the hardest city in America
St. Louis, and we ain't scared of ya
King of the drama, see him rollin' with the drama king
Yo Kay Slay, you want lil' momma from your magazine?
You know the one that's got a body like a cartoon
Ass like a whale 'til lil' durrty gotta harpoon
Woo! This stacking racks on racks
Go check my hallways mother fucker, plaques on plaques
These niggas lying a lot, I'm speaking facts on facts
My hotel room's infested durrty, rats on rats

[Hook: T-Pain]

[Verse 4: French Montana]
Looking at a dollar bill, saw the White House
Then I flipped a couple bills, bought a white house
Triple beam on a triple stack, triple back
Going back court like I dribbled back, simple fact
When that drop roller and that top fold up
Bitches going both ways like they're bipolar
Pop the ace Black Jack, ski mask, black mac
Hit the back of your head, turn your fitted to a snapback
Best of the greatest, bought the pussy and paid for maintenance
Waste of money, wack head, the bitch brainless
Word to Kay Slay, you niggas straight stuntin'
I be spending seven digits like it ain't nothin'

[Hook: T-Pain][Intro]
Yeah, turn the lights on
Yeah, turn the lights on
Yeah, turn the lights on
Turn the lights on

Or better yet, like Rev and them
And on the bottom of my sneaks they red, man
And I ain't talking 'bout no damn Meth and them
Stay Louboutin and I super grind
VS stones, they super shine
I pop the Perc, I get super high
And I drill your bitch, root canal
I rock Tom Ford, Concords
And I shine on these dime whores
This bitch done bought me a Rolex
And I still ain't got no time for her
These hoes be acting up
These niggas be acting tough
I'm in the Phantom, I'm backing up
And I'm bust down, but I'm strapped as fuck
So hold your horses, Polo horses
Aston Martin, we roll in Royces
Real niggas up in the building
Them hoes choose us, ain't no more choices

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wale]
These hoes be acting up
See, me, I don't practice much
Gold albums from the word of mouth
Gold bottles in the back of us
These Jones be broke as fuck
Too uptight, they won't open up
She got her arms folded even on the phone
I'm like, what the fuck is she here fo?
These hoes be acting up
These niggas keep wifing up
Please homie, got me cracking up
Never spent one more than a night with her
These hoes be a fucking joke
They'll never say a nigga didn't warn you though
Cause you can hit my phone like four in the morning
And I be like, hah, told you so

[Hook]

[Verse 3: French Montana]
These hoes be acting up
Big bread we racking up
Straight to the bank, cee-lo
Cancel that bitch like Nino
Ratchet ass ho, don't play with me
Want to Kobe me, want to Humphrey me
Want to Michael me, Russell me
Take me to the bank and Tiger me
Now these hoes be acting up
These clothes ten stacks and up
These cars 100 racks and up
These drums 100 rounds and up
Bitch, blow me like a trumpet
Twenty thousand, all in hundreds
Fuck it, money, money, money
Money, money, money, ah!

[Hook][Intro]
See people always seem to remember
When you ain't do nothing for them, they forget
Forget the best thing you can do for them, you feel me
So I just tell'em please don't act like act, no

[Hook]
All my niggas we the same, please don't act like that (3x)
I tell my family I won't change, please don't act like that (3x)
These niggas ain't gone feel my pain, please don't act like that (3x)
I told lil momma make'em pay, please don't act like that (3x)

[Verse 1]
Remember I ain't have no money, remember I was a youngin'
Remember I told my momma that I was out here thuggin'
Just get kicks, you see
My daddy caught whips and now he caught police
And I can do what I want, take you on a shoppin' spree
Caught my first case, you remember a nigga shot at me
I'm out here night by night, ain't a real nigga in sight
So I picked up me a mic, $200 a night
Night by night, now that 10k got me right
Fuck who did me wrong, it's only right
I put it on my song, free my niggas locked alone
I still got 100 on my phone
I'ma real nigga til we on
See the streets a never break me
But I'm going crazy, I been feeling down lately
Shoutout to the Chi cause that's who raised me

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I was robbing Jordan's, I was a juvenile so i didn't care
See life wasn't important, I lost a couple niggas this year
Auntie got cancer, granny gotta bad back
But she carry the family, like ? don't know how to act
Niggas claiming we guys, nigga we ain't no guys
Niggas leave you hanging, niggas snitch for lesser time
Flexin' on'em, exercise
Four chickens, extra fries
Got the trap spot turning up, tryna flip some extra cash
But my homie in a place, word got back
Ion't know if it's true but I'm on his ass
I live that life, my life is a blast
I keep my gun so I blow the pack
Future reference, I'm the future
Please don't test me, I'll shoot ya
Yo life a blooper
Shoutout to the real, I salute ya

[Hook]

[Outro]
Please don't act like that (12x)(Verse)

What’up Cassie, baby, when I land I’m gonna holla
Addicted like that cocaine they be folding in that dollar
That Special K, that heroine, got two watches, about eight chains
Got four cribs, about two planes, that space ship like Bruce Wayne
That slur in my talk, see that pimp in my walk
I be the prince in my city and you know we run New York
From that corner block to the big house
Hundred bottles stand on the couch
Now on them blogs when I read about you
Can’t be with you, can’t be without you
Damn, this shit cray’, we getting wasted
Pour it up, money grown up, shit done changed, I done blown up
But shawty kept it hundred next to me

[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus]
Broke a record on the day I dropped my video
I got three thick girls in my video
Pop a molly and you know you know you'll never stop
You think I'm turnt up wait until my album drops
Versace, versace versace I wear that vintage versace
Fashion week you can find me in New York posing for the paparazzi
And I'm all white like french montana
Oh shit there goes hannah montana
Acting like a little southern girl
Now twerking like I grew up in Atlanta

[Problem]
Go there with that work, went out for them people
And them ho niggas looking thirsty, please get them Aquafina
Money gone faster than cheetahs, old hoes miss this king like Cleveland
I ride through the hood, sucka niggas be hatin'
Say they sure gon' get at me, I been anxiously waitin'
Sippin' Pina Coladas, smoking flower with asians
Bitches, can't worry bout nothin'
Nigga, I ain't worried bout nothin'
Nigga wanna fight, we can trunk em
Reebok pump lumps in the young punk, ya feel?

[Hook]

[Crooked I]
I'm in the strip club, Secret Sunday, nigga got a 50 Band necklace on
I'm by myself, I'm turnin' up, haters out here better respect the throne
It's C.O.B. until they bury a nigga, Sut two times, what up my COB
This street money, I ain't worried nigga, I don't work, but see I love my job (Nigga work)
See me rollin' up the block, while I'm throwin' up a knot, and I'm going to the spot
Bad shorty on my jock, bad shorty on my jock
Open up her box on the Coconut Ciroc
This Eastside, L.B. City boy, rock 2 chains like Tity Boi
Crooked I live like a model with ass, that mean a nigga sit pretty boy

[Hook]

[Dizzy Wright]
East side, Las Vegas, young player comin' out of nowhere
Now I'm rappin' with the Big Seans, you like Woah Dere
Lil nigga, don't go there, so rare
I'm prepared for the lifestyle
Spit it how I live it when the mic's out
Got a housewife in a nightgown
Before rap, the one L, but let me put the pipe down
Comin' from the city of the Fight Night
Bringin' entertainment to the limelight
All the city really needed was an artist
And guess who the hottest, I guess I got the green light
Skee life, what it be like
Dizzy Wright be like what the tree like?
Kushed out in the function
Can't kill my vibe, fuck nigga, I ain't worried bout nothin'

[Hook]

[Game]
Got a million on my neck, lil fuck nigga, I ain't worried bout much
Y'all worried bout us, 16 out the clip till his watermelon bust
Got a bitch ridin' shotgun, with a .45 and a Louis Vuitton clutch
Where I been in the cut? Now I'm back, it's a rap, whole world on my nuts
And your girl on my nuts, consequences when these niggas be cuffin'
I'mma hit her raw, them I'm pulling out, nigga, I ain't worried bout nothin'
I ain't worried bout nothin', red styrofoam cup, sippin' on that gas
I can slow it down like French, or I can go Twista on that ass
My nigga turn it up, never turn down, while I'm sippin' the Don
My niggas gettin' it on, we got yo bitch in a thong
Flippin' her dome, one sip and she gone
We turn it on, give her the long bone, and then she go home
Make a nigga pull a grip out the cut, call a bitch I could fuck
Have her howlin' at the moonlight, AK 47 in your bitch
Put the pussy on Instagram, show you what the goon like
These LA hoes don't like me cause I fucked em all
I wear Louis, I wear Gucci, nigga fuck the mall
Niggas kill the club, so they kill fraud
I'm bout to kill me a nigga, and beat the charge

[Hook]

[French Montana]

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Diddy]
I ain't worried 'bout nothing, I don't even care
Talkin' money with you niggas, that ain't even fair
2 bitches on my lap, popping 20 pills
Naked women in my bed, counting 20 mills
And I ain't worried 'bout no banks I get drug money
Niggas talking like they rich ain't got my son's money
It's King Combs in this bitch with the best work
Give a chick a hundred grand for the best twerk
Fuck the fame all the lights and the stardom
Forget about Saint Tropez [?] we landed in Harlem
Niggas standing in amazement, Diddy my name's in the pavement
Worried about nothing cause I'm still counting that money I ain't even made yet
Motherfucker

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
(M-m-m-m-maybach Music)
This car called a Rolls, my Belaire be Rosé
Gave a bitch 50 bands, I never gave her a rose
Watch the pot as it rolls, all my profits just rolls
Started on the first floor, my apartments just rose
Penthouse full of paintings, my classics look painted
Shawty a hustler, she require retainments
She let me fuck cause I'm famous
Bad Boy-related
Gold Sky Dweller marjella
Maybach umbrella we dangerous

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg]
What is IRS, I don't pay no taxes
Blowing money fast, breaking bad batches
Ridin' 'round in my lap, I'm flying 'round in my jet
I'm so smoked out, so loped out, 20 Crip is my set
Nigga what y'all wanna do
Big Snoop and I'm coming through
All my goons in grey and blue
Right here right now no me preocupo de na

[Hook] (French Montana)[Intro: Rick Ross]
Walk with a real nigga
Self-made millionaire
What more could you ask for, huh?

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I'm a kamikaze in a Maserati
I'm a John Gotti, got my own army
Worth fifty million and it's all on me
Fifty on my Rollie knowing yours phony
Last problem I had, a nigga head-shot him
Say the word on the street is that my man got him
If I wasn't involved you wouldn't hear about him
I got Lears and all -- don't need Aaliyah problems
May she rest her soul, I got a sleeping problem
All my CDs gold but the Visa darker
Bastard child but I got a fleet of cars
Double-M G this little thing of ours
Take it to the door, motherfucker, plea
Niggas layin' on your crib while your momma sleep
Home-cooked meals for the real niggas
Hot Tec 9 for you little niggas
Want to shoplift? Come and boost this
We run the fucking game, nigga, truth is
Cargo pants and my red bottoms
Talking 'bout birds you know the boy got 'em

[Hook: French Montana]
No clothes in the closet, it's all birds
No sneakers in the sneaker box, it's all birds
No luggage in the trunk, man, it's all birds
And I ain't going back -- I'mma ball first

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Anything you need know I get it cheap
My nigga Rozay make millions while he getting sleep
Cars European come and see the fleet
We're commercial; come and see us if you need the street
I'mma bring it home nigga bet the bank
Sierra Leone all up in the link
'Bout to double up, some Mason Betha shit
Huddle up, round table, King Arthur shit
Shorty ass fat, she can't stand straight
Spent your down payment on my landscape
Niggas sideways like the Phantom door
Hundred round drum sound like round of applause
Slicker than a can of grease
Paid the state in the ice, hundred grand a piece
Coke boy, I'll be thirty for sure now
Coke damn near same price as dope now

[Hook]
