[Hook]
Patience is a virtue, virtue is a grace
Grace is a little girl who wouldn’t wash her face
Grace is a virtue, virtue is a mean
Between two extremes, one of excess, one of deficiencies
Patience is a virtue, virtue is a dirty stain
Cleanliness is next to godliness and isn’t worth the pain
Grace is a virtue, virtue of the pageant
And this is not a love ballad

[Verse 1]
You suggested Lithium to get me better again
That is unless if we, uhm, get together again
But that ain’t gonna happen, never again
Send my well wishes to your nutritionist
Your dietician, your pharmacist
Your personal trainer and your accomplices
Your partners in thought crime
Your criminal group thinking doctors online
There is a difference between what is and isn’t
Business and friendship
Parental assistance and an assistant
A permanent solution and a quick-fix
A fit body and sound mind
A hundred hour weeks, and dangerous amounts of downtime
You got a lot to offer, but you’re not an author
If I kill your persecution complex that don’t make you a martyr
Drop the styrofoam cross, you can’t walk on water
You could use it for floatation, not a flying saucer
You suggested professional help like I wasn’t mentally well
What I was feeling wasn’t meant to be felt
Duly noted, you’ll be quoted in the eulogy
It’ll be passed off as poetry between you and me
I know you know the difference between confession and conjecture
Prosity and needing to be lectured to a meet up
The student becomes the teacher, the son becomes a parent
From a scab to teamster, the sun becomes apparent
From a chemical imbalance to a litany of habits
And this is not a love ballad

[Verse 2]
You should drown me in that womanhood and teach me how to swim
Beat me with my own hands and tie down my limbs
Suffer for my sins or let me suffer from within
But in the end this is not a love ballad
We can battle with tattoos to cover up the bruises
The first to show any sign of discomfort loses
For the first time in a long time you’re not who my muse is
And this is not a love ballad
I’m not thirsty, I just got hungry eyes, you look appetizing
And from a distant stare broken eye contact in disrepair
Sometimes I disappear, but now you see me
A part Irish goodbye, other part Harry Houdini
Put my feet to the fire, I got Satan on my heels
If it’s all about prestige, just wait for the reveal
I got a new bag of tricks to turn, a new black magic woman bitch to burn
So much for live and learn

[Hook]

[Outro]
Is a music box that haunts me from the top-shelf of the bedroom closet
I don’t touch it, it just cuddles with my conscience
I’m on constant guard, jittery the whole night
Clinging the sheets because it sings to me slow like
And that’s her song running through an hourglass
Built with two wine bottles that I found in a flower patch
Planting it in quicksand, refusing to sink fast
Abusing me slow, I hear the music and I think back
Before the fall, before the set up
Before the interest in sex even developed
I fell in love with distance as an ex’s best friend
There used to be revenge, but i couldn’t see no end
So I had to switch the lens in and focus on some flesh
No more clinging to old threads[Produced by: Buck 65]

[Verse 1]
I was a lot more comfortable being vulnerable and open
When I was younger and it wasn’t clear if I was or wasn’t joking
But so much is broken, just like fuck it, the fix is in
If i can’t hide in plain sight anymore I’ll just stay hidden
It’s been a minute since I left this domicile
No need to change my outfit, I rock it like it’s going out of style
It’s not in style? Ain’t no one here to tell me otherwise
It gets more difficult to stay inside during the summertime
But most of the time it’s just like any other time
Avoid personal interaction and human touch, shut the blinds
It’s been a while since I left this bachelor pad
I need to go to the market soon cause the food is going bad
The food is bad. I found it’s difficult to just cook for one
With healthy recipes, well, depending on what book they’re from
If you want to eat healthy you gotta dirty some dishes
The frozen dinners quickly ready to serve and it’s so delicious
It’s not delicious, it’s disgusting, but it satiates the hunger with a quickness
And hey, at least it’s something, at least it’s something
At most it’s nothing, fuck’s wrong with me? I don’t know, I’m just adjusting
It’s been a month since I left this cabin
The doctor was worried about a fever and other difficulties I’ve been having
She called me on Christmas, that was my gift
She was worried I might die, I said “I might die? No shit”

[Verse 2]
It’s been forever since I said something that I can’t wiggle free from
If there’s anything I cherish in this self-inflicted prison, it’s freedom
Comes at a cost so I’m private to a fault til I default
On the loan for home, it’s actually more like a vault
No one knows the combo but little old me
The head honcho, the holder of the key
Alone, but never lonely
It’s been a millennia since I left this dominion
Been in the company of any women
At least I got my kittens
Spent more cash on my cat than I did myself
When he stopped eating, I took him to the vet so they could check his health
They put a feeding tube into his neck
I said “Please let this work cause if it doesn't I got nothing left”
I didn’t say that, but they saw that. Cat had my tongue
I didn’t speak at all, they told me to call back
What, it wasn't weird I did nothing but stand right there?
With a "fix this, money’s no object" type stare
It’s been a year since I stepped into anyone else’s private quarters
I’ve been busy self-diagnosing disorders
First world problems, yeah, USA, number one
Top of the world, I’m in a tux and cummerbund
Welcome everyone to the party of the century
It’s sure to be one for the books, no doubt, medical ones especially

[Outro]
My 20’s were a roar, my 30’s were a blur
My 40’s, I’m not so sure, but I’mma make ‘em purr
My 20’s were a roar, my 30’s were a blur
My 40’s, I’m not so sure, but I’mma make ‘em purr
My 20’s were a roar, my 30’s were a blur
My 40’s I’m not so sure, but I’mma make ‘em purr
And I’mma make ‘em purr, but, but I’mma make ‘em purr
I’mma make ‘em purr[Intro]
Of all the words of mice and men
The saddest are, ''it might have been''
Of all the words of mice and men
The saddest are

[Hook]
I like for my shoes to look like they've been walked in
My house to look like it's been lived in
My car to look like a coffin that's been driven off a cliff
My career like a non-stop graveyard shift

[Verse 1]
Don't clean the crime scene cause time means money
Don't need visine when my eyes seem bloody
I see dead people, but who doesn't?
We walk undercover, deadpan blending in with other human puppets
Discussing nothing but the sports and weather
If I stare long enough they all morph together
Then I freak out, it'll blow my cover
So I just keep out, no, we don't know each other
I'm on the road to recovery, no GPS
Hoist in my sails ‘till the sea breeze rests
Suck wind if you wanna player hate
Day to day I use my fear of falling asleep to stay awake
I appear psychic-like, but I'm not a psychic
You're just predictable with no fight left to fight it
If you write it they will come with a red pen and a tazer-gun
Let's do something

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I sift through the ashes in search of surviviors
Digging up the Earth filling urns with dirt
For what it's worth I'm richer than the cementary soil
I use slant drilling to get my midnight oil
I've been moonlighting as a daydreamer
I'm at the wheel of an eight-seater, (hey) hey mister gatekeeper
Call me key master, no, home owner
One, two and to the three and to the foreclosure
They said the war was over, but we know it wasn't
They wanted more soldiers so we said ''sure, fuck it''
Here's a fresh batch of people with setbacks
The poor folk, in fact they’re all broke cause of your debt traps
Picking the pockets of people who probably needed assistance most
Selling them lies, selling them out, sending them off to a distant coast
Telling them anything anyone left with impossible debt is receptive to
Breaking a promise of negative worth like ''buddy there's nothing left for you''
Gotta buy buy buy to stay alive, they punish the payment delayed
Then they charge you for the low balance then they ask ''why didn't you save?''
Too long we took it on the chin, too long we took it to our grave
Now we take what we can get, fuck an unlivable minimum wage
Do something

[Bride]
It might have been
(Do something)
It might have been
Of all the words of mice and men
The saddest are Vonnegut busy
Do it, do it - mess up my mind (Vonnegut busy)
Do it, do it - mess up my mind

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I shoot myself in the foot, I put my foot in my mouth
Clean it while it’s there, and then i suck the bullet out
Reload the weapon, now that's conservation
Stay locked and loaded in a bad conversation
He making blank statements like the circles of your ammunition's finite
Visionary nothing, you're a man who lives with hindsigh
Return to the hive mind and call me back
I’m predicting early that you’ll be the Monday morning quarterback
So, cocksure in a culture that gangs up on bully-types
Mob mentality, as if that isn't what a bully's like
Inspiration strikes like an union
I write these lines just to cross 'em, I'm concluding
If my mama don't wanna she never has to work again
You never asked me why I spread myself so thin
I'm finna flirt dirty with the pen and flick my tongue on this bottom
I promise writer's block ain't never been a problem
I'll probably make the columns wanna pop bottles of pain relief
Sometimes it's what you don't say that says the most to say the least
Idle feet are the Devil’s fetish club
A highly exclusive spots none of us are members of
Dante is a scrub - we kicked him out the van and steamrolled him
In 2010 we had a couple dreams stolen
Me and B. Dolan relocked and reloaded
When it feels like you're going through hell, keep going
And as they say may the bridges that we burn light the way

[Hook]

[Outro]
Do it, do it - mess up my mind
Do it, do it - mess up my mind
Vonnegut busy[Intro]
I’ve heard enough of you young fellas, who think you know it all
You know nothing, you have not seen a shot fired
And you’re waving the damn flag
Frank, what’s up man?
Watchin' some bullshit, on the news
Fuckin' bullshit. Reporters, tryin' to win a fuckin' Emmy

[Hook]
Makeshift patriot
The flag shop is out of stock
I hang myself at half-mast
Makeshift patriot
The flag shop is out of stock
I hang myself via live telecast

Coming live from my own funeral
The beautiful weather offered a nice shine
Which is suitable for a full view of a forever-altered skyline
It's times like these I freestyle biased opinions every other sentence
My journalistic ethics slip when I pass them off as objective:
"Don't gimme that ethical shit."
I've got exclusive, explicit images to present to impressionable American kids
And it's time to show this world how big our edifice is

That's exactly what they attacked when a typically dark-skinned Disney villain
Used civilians against civilians and charged the Trojan horses into our buildings
Using commercial aviation as instruments of destruction
Pregnant women couldn't protect their children
Wheelchairs were stairway obstructions
Now I have to backpedal from the shower of glass and metal
Wondering how after it settles we'll find who provided power to radical rebels
The Melting Pot seems to be calling the kettle black when it boils over
But only on our own soil so the little boy holds a toy soldier
And waits for the suit and tie to come home. We won't wait till he's older
Before we destroy hopes for a colder war to end
"Now get a close up of his head"

[Hook]
Makeshift patriot
The flag shop is out of stock
I hang myself at half-mast
Makeshift patriot
The flag shop is out of stock
I hang myself while the stock markets crash

The city is covered in inches of muck
I see some other pictures of victims are up
Grieving mothers are thinking their children are stuck
Leaping lovers are making decisions to jump!
While holding hands, to escape the brutal heat
Sometimes in groups of the three
The fallout goes far beyond the toxic cloud where people look like debris
But all they saw after all was said, beyond the talking heads
Was bloody dust with legs looking like the walking dead calling for meds
Hospitals are overwhelmed. Volunteers need to go the hell home
Moments of silence for fire fighters were interupted by cell phones
Who's going to make that call to increase an unknown death toll?
It's the one we rally behind
He's got a megaphone, and he's promising to make heads roll
So we cheer him on, but asbestos is affecting our breath control
The less we know, the more they fabricate. The easier it is to sell souls

Talking Interlude:

"There is a new price on freedom, so buy into it while supplies last
Changes need to be made: No more curbside baggage
7PM curfew
Racial profiling will continue with less bitching
We’ve unified over who to kill, so until I find more relevant scripture to quote, remember; our God is bigger, stronger, smarter and much wealthier
So wave those flags with pride, especially the white part"

We sell addictive 24-hour candlelight vigil in TVs
Freedom will be defended at the cost of civil liberties
Viewers are glued to television screens
Stuck, cause lots of things seem too sick
I use opportunities to pluck heart strings for theme music

I'll show you which culture to pump your fist at, and what foot is right to kiss
We don't know who the culprit is yet, but he looks like this
We know who the heros are. Not the xenophobes who act hard
"We taught that dog to squat
How dare he do that shit in our own back yard!"

They happened to scar our financial state and char our landscape
Can you count how many times so far I ran back this same damn tape?
While a cameraman creates news and shoves it down our throats on the West Bank
With a ten-second clip put on constant loop to provoke US angst

So get your tanks and load your guns and hold your sons in a family huddle
Because even if we win this tug of war and even the score, humanity struggles
There's a desperate need of blood for what's been uncovered under the rubble
Some of them dug for answers in the mess, but the rest were looking for trouble

[Hook]
Makeshift patriot
The flag shop is out of stock
I hang myself at half-mast
Makeshift patriot
The flag shop is out of stock
I hang myself, don't waive your rights with your flags[Hook x2: Will Oldham]
Force of my love was strong
The sea lion laying down long
A song in the air
Why should singer care
When singer can be among song

[Sage Francis]
Ma, Ma - look what I did, Ma
Look what I did to my hands, I broke em
You gave me the stone, gave me the chisel
Didn't say how to hold em
Didn't say give away every piece of the puzzle
Till I was left with nothing
But I took it upon myself to crush it up and distribute the dust
Get in the bus, hop in the van
Jump in the water, crawl to the land
Build another castle out of the sand
Break it down and then I get into the saddle again
Going city to city I'm already lost, tell the boss
Who is new in town; I'm-a ride this horse till it bucks me off
And I'm forced to shoot it down
I'm-a take him out for some gasoline
I'm-a trade this cow for some magic beans
Make Mom proud of the deals that I've made
Cause I'm just a modern day Johnny Appleseed
But I'm glad that I never passed the genes
And I never put down the axe
Piano Man got a checkered dance floor
To grace and the painful look on his face
Cause the crowd is packed and the louder they clap
The less he is able to make the connection
Between what he sees when he hears certain notes
And the hurt that is shown in his facial expression
I don't need your go-ahead to go ahead
No, I know no one said it was gonna be easy
But sweet Jesus, who wants to sleep with me?
Way too many moves to learn
But not enough people to put em on
Lookit, Mom, no hands
I built this suit of armor with wooden arms

[Hook]

[Saul Williams]
Oh God I think I'm dead
I can't see outside my head
Brains and bloods and cryptic gang men
Czars and warlords breaking bread
Thoughts are thought
What's said is said
I thought that 'fore you said it
I didn't mean to think out loud
My tongue slipped but who let it?
Let it be, let me be, let me go, nah let me out
My manhood nods and whispers when my father screams and shouts
Dear dad I'm sad you're dead
A new man standing in the pulpit
He bows before a wooden cross and forces praise the culprit
I'm a tenor in the choir but I sing a different song
Of how the where's and why's of now all prove I don't belong
But I'm staying I've planted seeds and plan to watch them grow
I've watered all my wishes dreams fulfilled more seeds to sow
And I promise to learn to love the way I've learned to fear
To unknot all the inhibitions tangled in my hair
To let my ego mound in piles around the barber chair
And make a graceful exit from my vexed and troubled years
I've decided I've been invited to my own resort
Where knights can leave their armor neatly piled by the door
And every woman, child, and man will gather by the shore
And study how sea lions swim in cursive

[Hook][Verse 1]
While taking deep, slow breaths I try to grow wings
Decided to stay low, the halo was a smoke ring
Fell around my neck, I started choking
My soul got stuck looking for openings
I thought ghosts weren’t supposed to sing like cage birds
If you’re a free broken spirit let the pearly gates burn, baby, burn
The muted trumpets in my chest take turns
When I release the spit valves gag on Gabe’s germs
Some of this is fiction written all across it
But this bathroom lit and I’m too busy spitting in a faucet
Shitting blood thinking of the quickest drug to heal me
But I’m not lovesick, your sick idea of love would kill me
Time to pry open the truth
Apply pliers to my own broken tooth
DIY or die, no health care benefits
You could spare me the ‘'I know, I’ve been there’‘ sentiments
I sense a sentimental song coming along, run along
Before I ask you to dance and all you get is trampled on upon faces
Mainly my own though, I’ve lost patience
I’m painting over old photos, I’m new now
Fresh out the box all bloody
Somebody cut me loose, slap me, call me ugly
Say it how you see it, buddy, I’m a hurting hot mess
A constantly inconsistent work in progress
Fat girl in a prom dress, do more, talk less
They wanna assassinate your character content
When pressed like ab-workouts, super thin
The whitest looking Jew screaming ’‘Jerusalem’'

[Hook]
(Got my ID ready)
Who are they?
They are the identity thieves
(Got my ID ready)
Who are they?
They speak war and pretend that it’s peace
(Got my ID ready)
Who are they?
They are killers by association
(Got my ID ready)
Who are they?
They’ll hurt your credits with misappropriation

[Verse 2]
You can’t just get comfy and stand in one spot
Like a king of the mountain you've been planted on top
Surveying the land of your family plot
‘Til it’s all been abandoned, you're the man 'til you’re not
It happens like that when you rest on your laurels
Like a shot to your back, it’ll mess with your morals
It’s a matter of fact I’ve consulted with oracles
Precaution of a shaman who was dressed so informal
I’m a poor man with cash making points with no fingers
Bringing popular back 'till the smell of sex lingers
Hard bodies will stack more neatly and tidy
But I swallowed her visions, now she sees inside me
She-devil so chiesty, deceptive and sexy
Walk with me, I’ll give your legs epilepsy
My game is so shaky, if you love pain but hate me
That’s a paradox I’m unable to explain
Conspiracy exposed, it’s the way in which we fold the bill
Trying to overdose, instead you just choke on your pills
It’s overkill if you’re just going for thrills
Seek a mountain you can punch good, expose into molehills
I’ve done this yodel ever since I was a child
I’ve got this other yodel I ain’t done in a while
It goes pure Himalayan intelligence
Braving the elements from a man cave and haven’t shaved ever since
Never forget, you were the sperm that made it
Plus the unexpected pregnancy could have been terminated
So thanks to chance, and romance, and dancing
We’re headed to our own damn thing, prepare kid
Why you think I let you get away with doing radio-friendly versions of what I do?
Like I wouldn’t chide you, out perform, out write, and out rhyme you
Outsmart, out heart, and out grind you
Out shine you with the torch that was given to me
Torches are not passed to the bastards of the little league
If rap was a game you’d be M.V.P
Most Valued Puppet of this industry
Get your I.D, Independent? Fuck you![Verse 1: Scroobius Pip]
When it's cold, we bite the top of our zips
Pull it up with our teeth 'til it covers our lips
Then exhale; central heating for the weather beaten
No feet are beating, this street in to stand by us like Wil Wheaton
Walking these streets with that distant stare
No one likes us but we don't care
Maybe our kind don't fit round here
Our minds find conflict round here
See we choose to cruise a route that ain't paved with gold
So our shoes don't slip they stick and grip this road
Our tools are ink slicks that we engrave and mould
For an end goal you maybe can't spend or fold
We won't settle for unsought careers
Or forty years of salty tears
Like a battered up mix-tape with a long faded label
When I'm old and decaying I'll be decaying and able

[Hook]
If the bad times are coming, let 'em come
Let the death drum break the slump
Before the once young braves succumb
The fickle flicker of desire expires
If the bad times are coming let 'em come, let 'em come

[Scroobius Pip]
I see so many kids that love being writers more than they love writing

[Verse 2: P.O.S]
Bad times coming
Bash up a castle
I know the zoo keeper
Line em up
Lions on em
I haven't slept yet
Ever, crust
Kickin up dust
Leave em sickin up rust colour
Let it come
Let em run
Let me laugh at it
Smash like it's rampage
Live it up
Grasp at it
No pill for the whirlwind coming
Let it come
Spin with the rush no fun till the times up
Run against the flood
All stroke no float
For the hope for the coast pump blood
Stump fuckers on the daily
Dump lungs
Volume is up
Watch em hush for the lump sum
But not around here
Around here we steer clear
Of holding our tongues to stack funds
When bad times come it's like some old news
New shit
Choose yours
New whip or brick?
Thank you

[Hook]
If the bad times are coming, let 'em come
Let the death drum break the slump
Before the once young braves succumb
The fickle flicker of desire expires
If the bad times are coming let 'em come, let 'em come

[Verse 3: Sage Francis]
Quality home life, living a lie now
Take it to the road certain women would lie down
Haunting images I witnessed in my town
Are floating through the night with a knife and a white gown
Gotta dig a bigger hole
But I can never climb out, just burrow and burrow
Or stand on the high ground while pulling the sky down
Wait for the high tide and try not to drown
You're waiting another day with eyebrows furrowed
Just say what you gotta say... like right now, fucko
Or pipe down bucko, I'm doubting what many say
"Why do you think they call it a borough now anyway?"
Feed the lion despite what the sign says
Act defiant and impolite to my friends
While making side bets in a risky gamble
Save the wild sex for the filthy animals
I switch the channel if the nature turns mechanical
Become detached like your snake mandibles
The slack jawed yokel is practising his cat calls
It's got the lab rats bounding off the padded walls

[Hook]
If the bad times are coming, let 'em come
Let the death drum break the slump
Before the once young braves succumb
The fickle flicker of desire expires
If the bad times are coming let 'em come, let 'em comeThe sun flies through the sky leaves darkness in it's wake
And now I hear the hellhounds barking at the gate
To be honest sometimes I want you to relate
This ain't up for discussion it's not a topic for debate
Entrepeneurs that want to bottle up the hate
And slap a label on the glass so hard that it'll break
And if you break it you buy it and we sold it by the case
It's ok if you just try it you can hold it to your face

How close can you get without touching it?
How far removed can you get from the public?
Can you keep a secret?
If not, can you tie a slipknot?
Can you stand high up on this brick block?
Listen to the clock tick tock and switch gears
It's been one, two, three, four, five, six years

Are they all dancing now? Are you joining the party?
Are just celebrating your life just by destroying your body?
It's a part of your psyche that I want to sight-see
I don't need you as a tour guide and I don't want you to like me
I was voted least likely
That's it just least likely
So pardon me if I seem fiesty
Bite my tongue like a bullet, take a pull from the peace pipe
Push past the low expectations of me each night
I leave light in my wake and I moonwalk across the floor
Until I hear the sex kittens all purring at the door
There's something outside that we all want
But inside there's an ex who marks a soft spot
Till it rots and decays and then no one else cares
It's been seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve years

Now I sell pennies to the well-wishers
I fish through the coinslots
I fall through a girl's bait participate in boycotts
I demonstrate a demon's trade
With a face void of thoughts
If that don't launch a thousand ships
Than that's a helen of troy's loss
There's nothing in this horse
It's hollow, it's empty, its entry will not be forced
Like an eyesocket stripped clean of tears
It's been thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen yearsDay one I played with her blood
Day two left her face bruised and we called it making love
Day three her blood played with me
Dirty talk caught me off guard
Had the nerve to ask if I thought she was crazy

Baby you don't know where my mind has been
Fell off the bike more than twice
But it's time to ride again
This time I learned from my past falls
Old wounds may re-open soon
Burn 'em in alcohol
I heard that last call
It was a close one
Road runners
Know which direction to go when snow comes
Now we're coasting
Extra traction on radial tires
Having sex in the back wrapped in radial wires
Self abusive
Stuck in a bad place
Head full of bruises and scratched face
I've bled profusely
Stirred in my juices
So you can taste me
Put my neck in a noose
And swung to safety
Found a land mine planted in the sole of my foot
I can't find santcum in the holes of input
I keep diggin'
Covered in earth
I undress
They run tests
I leave the dirt to the experts
White coats and shiny objects
I jump their lifeboat science project
We got a floater
Guinea pig overboard
Stone sober hillbilly kid with open sores
We rip vocal chords
Tearing them out
A mute manifesto that you'll probably never hear about
Weirded out about my wearabouts
Swears pierce my mouth
A bearded medicine man who wears a pouch
Keeps diggin' me
And I'm swimmin' uphill
I'm fightin' the tide of mudslide and blood spilled
Until I got a shirt off my back
And a girl on attack
On top
With a curled lip
The world matches our bedsheet
We shared geography now
I explore virgin territory
Squeeky seats acting as a mating call
Nothing on me but her
And didn't feel naked at all
Ever feel the need
To keep it so real you feed
Yourself into her hunger and don't care if she bleeds
Askin' all these questions
Ain't highly recommended
They'll eventually get answered
If you put time in the friendship
That is if what you're doin' is helping
And it's not like you'll know until you ah-
Reach the ending

She wanted my
Agony agony agony
In her body
(Repeat x4 then continues throughout hook)

Day one I played with her blood
Day two left her face bruised and we called it making love
Day three her blood played with me
Dirty talk caught me off guard
Had the nerve to ask if I thought she was crazy

She was crazy
I need more holes to breathe from
Went under the knife
I contemplated freedom
Put it all out on the operating table
Clutching onto rubber ducks
I played double dutch with some jumper cables
And I broke like the water
It started rushing
All of a sudden
There she was gone
I'm the fall guy
She's a sight for sore eyes
I'm in labor all night till a new day is born
Her blow brocades like high rolled dice
Her exposing one eighty when I look into her snake eyes
I'm not afraid of dying
Pieces of me die all the time
I keep digging (I keep digging)
I leave the dirt to the experts
Who push the boundaries of pleasure till the sex hurts
I hold today with a death grip
And play hard to get with tomorrow
So as not to look so fucking desperate
Face sweaty
Hands unsteady
Blood pressure off the charts
My heart hangs heavy
Untreated wounds
Through repeated moons
I seem to have developed through your needy womb
Your feeble ill cocoon
I don't breathe for many people
I don't mourn the pieces killed in you
My injection must have been lethal
Pick up the shovel love
You got some diggin' to do

Agony agony agony
(repeat x4)

She wanted my
Agony agony agony
(repeats as sage says the following:)

Day one I played with her blood
Day two left her face bruised and we called it making love
Day three her blood played with me
Dirty talk caught me off guard
Had to nerve to ask if I thought she was crazyNow I know it ain't right, but I decided I had to
Us poets paint life, but don't get recognized till after
So I faked my own death just to see what would happen
As I take shallow breaths and wait for people's reaction
It was funny at first, but I had to hold my laughter...wait
Before long I was on display at an open casket wake
And I'm the main attraction who draws a crowd
A freak show of sorts
Good thing my skin is pale enough to pass as a decomposing corpse
Frozen in my thoughts, laying stiff, playing with
People's emotions and awaiting a kiss from praying
Lips that I hate but miss
She didn't show, although she sent a card with flowers
How considerate, little bitch would make me sit in my car for hours
Heartless powers start to devour my patience, it gets me violent
I'm ready to fly shit and end everything like "I quit"
Then again I sit deathly quiet, biting my tongue
Just excited that some kids who were invited to come did
I'm the center of attention, the talk of the town
It ain't all that profound
But on this special day of mine I'm the one the universe revolves around
It's like a birthday, kind of
I also found that it's the worst way to find love
White doves battle black crows in one of the back rows
And everybody my ass knows back home is sporting black clothes
Looking glum as usual, it's all too familiar
I put the fun back into funeral
My morbid humor'll kill ya
For all that it's worth, people who I thought were jerks
Were putting on the water works and it sorta hurts
My momma stroked my hair with so much care but hardly spoke
Now my heart is broke, and yeah I should've let her in on the joke
But I'm honestly choked up, and I'm stuck holding back my tears
As I absorb the atmosphere, "I wanna turn back, I'm scared"
Then a hand touches my shoulder to calm my nerves
And something odd occurs because I heard my father's words
So I got disturbed, as he expressed what he's never said
What bothered me the most is that I remembered, he's dead
I manifested destiny
The best and worst of worlds has come true
As I'm buried alive, in the back of my mind echoes his words
"I love you"

[Outro]
Irony is a funny bastard
I mean you gotta be funny
When your mere existence is totally dependent upon God's twisted sense of humor
And I could cut this kid with a knife he's living so thick
The knife struck
Over privileged kids try to tell me life sucks
Men preoccupy their minds
Thinking about all the guys their wives had sexual relations with
I'd have patience if the innocence weren't lost
But when I scrub my hands the purity rinsed off
And when I scrubbed some more protective gloves tore
The only thing saving me from loving...Her[Verse 1: MC Lars]
It’s just another day in the life of an artist
Searching for truth in the rhymes that I harvest
Art is my savior, art is my crutch
Art is my breakfast, my dinner and my lunch
Painting poems on these walls and I know I can’t stop
Acrylics on my fingers, dripping sticky and hot because
I’m so inspired getting higher every day
Honestly these sonnets still have got a lot to say
So bring me a pen and a pad and a beat
Just one hit, one fix, and I’ll be free
‘Cause this is the land where dreams are made
Where people get robbed and pushers get paid
The passion and blood and the faith in my veins
Made everything okay when I felt it slip away
Yeah it’s been a minute since I’ve seen the sun
Since my parents saw their son and this process has begun
Cooking lyrics in a spoon, I stop and loop the beat
There’s never time to shower, socialize or eat
I pop a tab of poetry bump another line
Metaphors get mixed, I sit back and recline –
V5 rolling ball syringe stuck it in
‘Cause art was the curse and the cure and the friend
Know that it’s true – alive when I write this
The serpent is loose and I try not to fight this!

[Hook]
You ain’t gots to feel a low never
I’m the one out choppin’ wood in cold weather
The go-getters, we know better
Art of Darkness, poker face bettin’
I’m the one climbing up the stairway to heaven
Writing poems all alone welcome home

[Verse 2: Sage Francis]
Psycho sedative. Type 0 negative
Sick of this monotonous cycle. Repetitive
Is this reality? It’s like “No”…then it is
Back alley white snow medicine
For the defensive addictive personality type
Showing off teeth marks to prove reality bites
As if all of y’all lack the scars that match
But death is the bitch and that dog ain’t barkin’ back
That’s just junky speech
The only time I stop talking is when a belt’s between my teeth
It’s a feast for the addict, a beast of habit
Sneaks to the attic and seeks the magic that speaks back
Transcribe the interview
When I begin to use I can’t hide my inner views
If music was therapeutic I’d have been fixed long ago
But this is just a song you know

[Hook]

[Verse 3: MC Lars]
Once upon a time this kid had a dream
A voice and a purpose and a vision to be seen
I realized reflections of fame were but illusions
Art was the curse and the cure and solution
I met with clowns, snake charmers, publicists
Saw my name in magazines, laughing I was loving it
My muse and I used to drive and sing along
Down the California Coast, in the woods writing songs
Up in the mountains we tried to unplug
Away from the noise and the stress and the drugs
But I kept finding pills in the corner of my closet
Underneath the skeletons, hid them in my pocket
Like Jack Kerouac in a Big Sur Cabin
Or Alan Ginsburg in Greenwich Village rappin’
The Pantheon of Poets, visionaries drinking coffee
Sitting in the dark, through the window I was watching

[Verse 4: Sage Francis]
Like a sniper with a rifle and a life full of debt
2Pac fell off because he didn’t know the ledge
Respect the Jesus Juice like a noose around the neck
Mic cord wrapped around my arm during the soundcheck
(one, two.)
Oh, you ain’t gots to feel a low never
I’m the one out choppin’ wood in cold weather
The go getter, and I’m lickin’ my chapped lips
I’ll keep on swingin’ til a disc in my back slips
My ex called me callous (at least she called me.)
Pale flesh full of scabs (bad teeth from the coffee.)
Fat feet ’cause I’m portly (caffeine ’cause of a broken edge.)
When they speak high of my music it goes over my head
I’m travelin’ man with a gavel in hand
And a twelve member jury in the back of my van
We’re coming to a court room near you
I can see the rehab center filled with smoke in the rearview
I’m living with my big money. It’s my drinking buddy
When I squander it I ponder if it ever thinks of me
When my chips are down and my bottle bottoms out
But I’m on the up and up so what the fuck’s the problem ’bout?

[Hook]

[Verse 5: MC Lars]
In Western Australia, I saw the Southern Cross
Chasing turtles in the sea, our love paid the cost
My heart beat erratically woke up and all I saw
Were panties in my sleeping bag, a note in her bra
It said, “Dear Lars, we were never meant to be
You meant a lot to me, sending kisses in your sleep
In your sleep don’t cry – remember the magic
You still own it, you will always have it
I’ll send you haikus, with nothing but truth
I’ll send them care of Icarus, hope they get to you.”
What else could I do? I picked up the broom
Swept the pieces of my past from the corners of the room
While the beautiful people drink champagne and laugh
I just can’t hold back, I just can’t relax
Backstage in El Dorado, sitting with my fishing pole
In a dressing room consumed by my gang of wishing soulsThe lights are out
The phones are dead
And I'm the only thing that's running in this city
Except for the clouds
Man, they're coming down
If I knew my way around, I wouldn't feel so dizzy
Where's the telly?
Nobody can tell me
I don't speak a lick of that language and got a slippery memory
If I spelled it all out on my arm
Only if
But I didn't, so I think, "Get a grip, kid. Deal with it"
Baby's waiting for a ring
And won't settle for the substitute excuse that's forming
I've got a complicated case of escapism
For her, I tried to rewire my
Nature
Too tired to wake her
Up out of that artificial calm she was on
A drug-induced future that slipped out of her palms
Seductive rain dancer, she thinks I'm waterproof
Like Superman doesn't need a roof over his head
When I come home to roost
I'll need truth to hold in bed
But I'm seeking salvation in a booth, and the phones are dead
And the lights are out
And I'm the only thing that's living in this ghost town
Except for the clouds
And man, they're coming down
If I knew my way around by now, I'd be bound for home
Black out on white night in Rome
Black out on white night in Rome

[Jolie Holland singing]

I know that I'm in love, but I know I'm out of touch
And I know that I get dumb when I can sense something's up
And then I bottom out
European tailspin
Scrawling messages out on my pale skin in hopes they get mailed in
Before the ink poisoning takes effect
And it gets smudged cause I budge before letting paint set
I get judged by the ones who have shelter and rain checks
While I trudge through the mud because this foreign terrain's wet
Regain consciousness, then lose common sense
The ominous, dark skies that lie between me and Providence are signs
The obvious answer isn't standing on your face with stilettos on
If you pop the question wrong
Every song's a post afterthought, but I won't grab the chalk
To outline my body of work
Toe tags get caught in my teeth cause my foot is in my mouth
And the spurs are in my words, so my tongue can't dismount
Even after our rapport had fully run its course
I couldn't figure out the most heroic time to jump from the horse
And place this old hat for the last time on the coat rack
But I'd donate all my earnings from the race just to know that
Resisting urges to go back and get it later
Like the milk would unsour itself in the refrigerator
A wet boy in a dry, dry state
On an old country road where tradition has a blind date
I'll make it dance on its own grave tonight
With a change of direction by the pale moonlight
And if it needs theme music, I'll break out the bagpipes
Play a tune you ghostwrote me in a past life that goes like ...

[Jolie Holland singing]

Black out on white night in Rome
Black out on white night in Rome
Black out on white night in Rome
Black out on white night in RomeTonight I'm in the mood for some unscheduled affection
Spontaneous combustion...I'm playing with my fire inside
Burning my inner child blackened his skin to the tint of his sweatshirt
"Hey...when you play with the big boys, you get hurt!"
I used to suck my thumb while rubbing silk blankets across my cheek
Until my mom denied me access. I bawled for weeks
We don't speak to this day. I came to terms with my fear and loathing
Now I wear this clothing...like it's an extra layer of old skin
Afraid to shed...tears...in the fabric...from years that I've had it
Found abandoned on the stairs to the attic
Collecting runaway skin cells...absorbing memories
It's been to hell and back, dragged through the dirt and even worn by enemies
Born in the 70's of the 20th century
Making that distinction is for future reference...In case y'all remember me
And my genesis. What's most important is to remember this
Women and men are pissed. When they kiss they exchange spit that is venomous
Most of it is affection-less and the affects of this has us quick to clench a fist
Don't get fancy with your paintbrush when you reminisce

I'm sentimental and I miss what used to be close to me
Or maybe I've just got OCD and I can't break my old routines
Hopefully I reconcile with my inseparable...what lies inside from head to toes
Instead of symbolizing clothes...identifying with outside symbols...

Cut out the middle man...

But my woobie is in demand...

I'm feeling like a kid again

"It protected me from the wind, sea and sand
Sanity was saved from the crazy cemetery walks
And every awkward moment spent talking with the Boogie Man
Man...managed unconditional comfort. As I've come to understand...
The monsters are under my bed again...
The monsters are under my bed again."

Dedicated to the memory of my Black Sweatshirt[Verse 1]
He was a southpaw but had a killer right swing
An outlaw inside of the ring
Every now and then he'd be put against the ropes but then he'd bounce back
Catch a second wind and throw blows 'til noses crack
He smashed mouths, he saw red and blacked out
Received a couple pats on the back for the smack downs
Negative reinforcement, never did he endorse it
Had the business sense to wait for press conferences to talk shit
He wasn't a dullard, though he'd never say much
Properly mothered but his father taught him how to take a punch
It was bare knuckle touch of tough love
When he got drunk enough he took his kid down to the gym and fit him up with gloves
Tied together with a shoelace, took em apart put em on
Looked in the mirror, practiced his screw face
Said, "This is for you, Pops, for all the things we never got to do"
The hottest part of a flame is blue

[Hook]
The hottest part of a flame is blue [3x]

[Verse 2]
Now we got children thinking that they're born to fistfight
Cause they've been promised an apocalypse, by prophets without insight
He coulda fooled us, in fact we're dumbstruck
The school bus is looking like a dump truck
Stuffed in class like a landfill until it overflows
Babysitters can't get the students off their mobile phones
A junkyard dog is eating trash in the cafeteria
Feeling mad at America
The school counselor likes to recycle psychobabble
The assistant to the teacher is just an old TV
Now they've all got the urge to battle
Cause they see a sign that says, "Like to travel? R.O.T.C."
I don't think he can handle, he goes from flannel to camo
Cold putting all the ammo in his gun
He watched channel one, switched to channel two
Unplug completely, the hottest part of a flame is blue

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
We're acting like an enemy is the sea, sky, and land now
Came across soldiers who did nothing but yell, "stand down"
In their spare time inside a shower stall
If not that, they're at the corner store playing PowerBall
And when the towers fall, they get protective of this land
And won't stand for anything to get resurrected
They're waiting for the second coming, the Great Pumpkin
Deep down, they know they really wanna do is break something
That's what they're trained to do
And then they say to you
"Just cause you see the devil in my eyes don't make it true"
And I say, "true enough"
All that fire in your eyes shows pain
But the flame ain't blue enough

[Hook][Verse One]
I've been patient
I've been a mental patient
I've been a parental replacement for kids sent to the basement
A has been
I've been had
I've become best friends with a pen and pad
Understanding the logic of an inanimate object
Standing in the projects with a sign around my neck
Sayin' "Show Me My Respect!"
They thought it was a setup
Upset
I've been unusual
I've been an unusual, suspect
You're beautiful
Just check to make sure that you're musical
One sec
I'll be back in a minute
React to the limit and butt out if your ass is up in it
Ask if you can kick I say "No you may not
Cause your flow just ain't hot."
So you bust a straight shot
"Fuck the fuck do they got?"
Watch your mouth, what that kid say?
Sucka lied, no doubt, hit by the ricochet
Kids today, I just don't trust 'em
When I have mine
I'mma make him speak in rhymes, he'll think that it's custom
I'll tell him, that he's Muslim every Christmas
So on December 25th he'll be giftless
Then I'll convince this dumbass he's actually a Witness of Jehovah
Flip mad scripts til he's older
Have him bring fat chicks on over
Give 'em drinks if they're sober
We'll make some noise soon
If she stinks of an odor
Send her to my boy's room
This is my house, you don't like it, get the fuck out
Cause under my roof you live by my rules, son
I make you wanna bounce

[Hook]
Bounce
Sage Francis makes you wanna
Bounce
Joey Beat's beats makes you wanna
Bounce
Mythical, Non-Prophets
Whether it be concepts or battle rhymes I shatter minds
Bounce
The Secret Service crew

If you're jumpin' up and down right now stop it

[Verse Two]
I've made a man mad
I've been a mad man
I've been a goodie two shoes who walks barefooted in a bad land
I've been to Mattapan
What's up to my Boston heads
I came to visit y'all but you know me, I got lost instead
I toss in bed
Keep myself awake at night
Worried that I might not fall asleep until I see the light
My friends wanna see me fight cause I'm a black belt karate master
I'd rather have my freestyle raps help the party's laughter
Plus I'm out of shape and haven't trained in months
Count the amounts of time my face has been punched
I feel my cranial lumps
Say thee old chump, "I'll F you up!"
Cross your mind language with sign language, is y'all def/deaf or what?
"Do you mean the D.E.A.F. kind?"
He must have read my lips so hard he was left blind
I've never been signed but I've been signed off
Cause I never rhyme soft or wore designer cloth
Every time I cough
I swear to God that it's a cardiac arrest
Feel my chest
Make sure it's not a heart attack
I'm stressed
It's rest that I probably lack
And yes, I'm a full fledged, over the edge hypochondriac
Obsessed
With cleaning the rims on my Pontiac
Rollin' through the plaza askin' where the party's at
Tellin' Hardy's hat they're hardly fat
But couldn't all be wack
To get him violent like a lush wanting his car keys back
My wife don't want me back I want to hold her
It's a shame, she ain't been the same ever since I told her
"This is my house. You don't like it get the fuck out
Cause under my roof you live by my rules bitch."
She said I had to bounce

Jesse Pinkman: Tell me why you’re doing this. Seriously
Walter White: Why do you do it?
Jesse: Money. Mainly
Walter: There you go
Jesse: Nah, come on, man
Jesse: What?!

[Verse 1: B. Dolan]
Now let me say a little prayer before we eat
This is dedicated to the news that we delete
Associated guilt, bye bye, sucker freeways
Hard time rumbling, you wonder how we sleep
I’ll tell you: the answer is seldom and lightly
Record by the head, ball pen right beside me
You could choose one if you feel lucky
Either way you’re losing, it’s too bad you fucked up, dummy

Tough titties said the kitty
(Epic Beard Men! No pity!) No!
As an emcee it doesn’t matter how important being modest is
I hold this … arrogance over you Donovans
I’m Quasimodo, pseudo-mono, semi-automatic
I challenge a 40-ounce to my 4.0
You left crews battered, cut up, and bloody
Too bad (Too bad you fucked up, dummy!)

Walter: I’m thinking maybe you and I could partner up
Jesse: Sage, you and me?
Walter: That’s right
Jesse: Sage…

One for the one who couldn’t slow his roll
Two for the crews who broke up on the road
Three for the plea you copped and got old
But that was a long time ago

I’m not wasting time pushing my CDs to stores
I’m too busy just convincing people not to buy yours
I cock block, I black ball, no pause, no stalls
Brother B. Dolan got a story for y’all:

[B. Dolan]
Now once upon a time not too long ago
A local opener or two played the fool in a show
Dude, how you in the dressing room touching my shit?
I’m living out of that suitcase, you’re leaning on it
And every drink that you leave down next to my laptop
I think about stomping your teeth into the blacktop
Fifteen minutes over time (Oh hell no!)
And came back stage looking for dap, holding demos
I paid you a compliment, you asking about money too much
(Too soon) Too puffed-up, sonny (Too gas)
Too high (too funny) Too few paid dues
Do you, little bunny

Yo, it’s just too bad you fucked up, dummy
Too bad you fucked up, dummy (“Oh well”)
Too bad you fucked up, dummy
Too bad you fucked up, dummy

Walter: Did you learn nothing from my chemistry class?
Jesse: No. You fucked me. Remember? Prick. And let me tell you something else: This ain’t chemistry. Okay? This is art
Walter: Oh ho ho. I saw your setup. It was ridiculous. You and I will not make garbage
Jesse: Yeah, well, we’ll see about that

Too bad you fucked up, dummy
Too bad you fucked up, dummy
Too bad you fucked up, dummy

Walter: You know the business. (“Strange Famous!”) And I know the chemistry[Intro]
Sometimes a girl
(I want you to be happy)
Will come and go
(And that's like really what it comes down to)
Sometimes a girl
(But as one of my good friends in this world)
Will come and go
(And I hope that whatever happens, that)
Sometimes a girl
(You will be like, real happy)
Will come and go
(Not sort of fake, like that kind of happy)

[Sage Francis]
Maze broken, she's running, feet swollen, he's coming, cheese stolen
And before he even knows it she's gone
Tea cups sitting on the hollow tree stumps
He's dumped and can't seem to swallow these lumps; the beat goes on
Same fire, new passion, old flame: trade it in for a summer fling
It's nothing like that sweet old song
Tip over, root the trees, bend the leaves
Blend in with the open wound; the freeze frames keep him warm
The day's frost is scraped off; the weight loss
The new sign that says "keep off" as he speeds off into the storm
Out of spite the lighting strikes him twice
He's peeking out on the pike and cheating life, peeling out on the lawn
Now he's idling; his time is dwindling
In his mind he's figuring out life's about the little things
And his labyrinth in all its magnificence can only keep the mice trapped
The princess is innocent; she doesn't belong

I never thought I'd miss you
They had a ceremony where he put her in a bridle, the headstall
She stopped to think for a minute, and in a split second went AWOL
I never thought I'd miss you
He draws in the chin as in a expression of resentment or scorn
He's pulling on the reins, the bridle, the shower, the storm
The maze, the high tower, clouds are at war
The reins, the bridle, the shower, the storm
The maze, high tower, clouds are at war
The reins, the bridle, the shower, the storm
The maze, the high tower, clouds are at war
Clouds are at war, the clouds are at war

I never thought I'd miss you [3x]That's dope
That's fresh
That's dope
That's fresh
That's dope
That's fresh
That's fresh

This is what broccoli is all about

[Woman's voice]
And the way you boil broccoli, it's texture, and the green
Color is so wonderful... I'm simply amazed.. as a housewife right now


[Man's voice]
Why don't you serve this to president George Bush? You know, he once told the press that he wasn't too crazy about broccoli, and it actually made the news!

[Woman's voice]
I never imagined broccoli can be put together with something sweet like
This, and the yogurt is not so overpowering either

[Man's voice]
I think he went to the extent of being a, well you could say, evangelist of
Broccoli, like an ambassador of sorts. That's his greatness, really(Chorus)
She's a fairy with broken wings
I used to watch her perform
And if she hears me I hope she sings songs
That had me going right back
Couldn't find anyone in town to talk
Bout how no one like that
Should be confined to the ground we walk

She glides but just seems like she floats
And these folks decide to crush her wings until they're permanently broke
She rides gusts of wind just by the way she spoke
She cries but loves to sing songs of freedom and hope
On the eastside hustling, discussing things that we quote
In shallow conversation as if we have deep throats
We chokin' on confusion
Now show up as a heat stroke of we need coats
Trading in our cheap jokes for her c notes
I see notes being passed
I ask to see what these creeps wrote
Define silly kids and flying privileges revoked
Ski slopes have been blocked off they can't transit
Had weights tied to her ankles she most definitely can't skip
Town, shes held down by the transcripts my hands grip
Tried to tie her wings back on before they're once again clipped
Panic stricken, she'll remain stuck
On a Titantic sinkin', shes trying to stay up
Change her plan thinkin' it's OK
See this is strange but
Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves in a way that kept them chained up
I'd like to see
Her take flight into the stars
Instead of letting her fly free they keep her in jars
Instead of letting fly free they keep 'em in jars
I put my hand to the glass so hard
It might break the prison bars
It isn't hard to see why they keep her captive
Shes naturally attractive
Speaks with adlibs, shes uncommonly talented
Ain't enough adjectives to do her disposition justice
Kids are wishin' for just a kiss and it's a mission to touch her lipstick
Can't trust her with
Freedom of movement that's a chance to loose her quick
If she ups and splits
We might as well call that discussion quits
If we's to keep her down the government's underlings
Enslave people in this town especially if their culture's rich
Exploiting talents making it do a bunch of tricks
With the rest of the wingless imports
Repeatedly told you ain't a fairy just a bitch
Just a bitch, with a butt that's thick
So rub your tits, and thrust your hips
And suck my dick, and run your shit, and run your shit, and run your shit

(Chorus)
Shes a fairy with broken wings
I used to go watch her perform
And if she hears me I hope she sings songs
That had me going right back
Couldn't find anyone in town to talk
Bout how no one like that
Should be confined to the ground

(Verse Two)
When I was down in New York she'd send me letters
And I read her passages about how I left her to the savages
No matter how sad it is I didn't cry
Cause it was only a matter of time
Before they figured me out and tried to strip my pride
I knew the scoop
Wish you could've seen the blueprints in my eye
When I flew the coop
Utilizing overground railroads in the sky
It was live or die let me let you in on the secret of mine
Me and you are different girl
We don't even need wings to fly

We don't need wings to fly
Me and you... we don't need wings to fly
Keep on singing, give it a try, give it a try
Just keep on singing, give it a try, give it a try (5x)"Today, my mother killed me"

If I'm alive by the time you find this, it's a miracle
What else can be said, a vision quest with infrared
I'm at a dead end, I bled slow
From my chest, held my breath and did my mess and never let go
I lived a good life, I never had half-compromise a thing
And if I couldn't write, I'd think of other ways to optimize my living
No wife, no kids, no anchors
Hand over fist to withhold this info from the bankers
Don't know my neighbors, didn't take a village to raise me
Small-town mentality types thinkin I'm crazy
I ain't as weird as they paint me
Off color, I'm more gutter, punk, and ritzy
More glitz and glamour than others
Motherfuckers left me lonely in this designated corner
Had a couple walls that build upon, they made me a performer
Now shade me from the warmer weather
Save me from the slaughterhouse
That creeps between the pages where I try to hide my awful mouth
Speak discretely to the sheets that seem to be hollow
Punched a ladder full of holes, just for my swollen feet to follow
Support me all you want, don't let me drop a field of land
I'm not going to stop until God is my ceilin fan
Spare the lamb, save me from my former-self
That creeps between the pages as the line across and locks my self
Now this is my box, these are my walls
This is when time stops and I'm all that there ever was
And I'm all there ever is and I'm all that there ever will be
A freeze frame pine box soliloquy... Call me FRANCOIS

(Hook)
Call Me Francois (call call call me francois)
(Call call call me francois)

Take what you can; leave what you must
Because y'all comin with us, (motherfucker you comin with us)

Fill your bags with the rags that you wear and their necessities
Along with the dog-tags and family recipes
Rest in peace, if you arrest the pace, movin haste
God-speed you black empress, get dressed, we're late
She painted my head orange, carved my face with her tongue
Emptied out my insides and lit the candle behind my eyes
Had the strike of twelve to midnight, winter queen
Left with my life rival in a white limousine
When he made her dress twirl, it looked like a mushroom cloud
Everybody ducked down except for me, that's my destiny
He used a broken condom as a corsage
I watched him push the rusty pin through her prom dress into her heart
Kill me already; fill me with confetti
Crush me up and sprinkle me over their wedding and her pregnant belly
I wasn't ready to suppress these memories, undress the mam', O' Reese
Forget the family, streamline the enemy, design the penalty
Cruel and unusual, commit the felony, unfit for prison duty
No man's an Island, except for Island man; he's a ROCK STAR!
No man's an Island, except for Island man; he's a ROCK!

(Hook)[Hook]
Can I kick it? (yes you can) {*3X*}
Well I'm gone (go on then)

Can I kick it,to all my people who get wicked like Sage does
Before this did you know what my real name was
Paul Francis acting like he's on the same drugs
Never even felt the effects of a strange buzz
You never ever catch me holding a beer mug
Your talking shit like as if you was a real thug
If that's true lick a shot BUCK feel the slug
That's what you get for totin guns like you were Elmer Fudd
I'm selling tapes for three bones wanna catch a dub?
This shit is dope kid it makes you wanna cut the rug
Illuminati's got every part of my body bugged
The micro chip is in your wrist now give it a tug
Be nice to females give a bitch a hug
Triple X styles coming cleaner than your tub
You better tell your girl about it because she's a scrub
A big problem that I had to nip in the bud
Dropping me her seven digits while I'm in the club
Talking 'bout I look I need a back rub
Son she's a natural disaster like a flash flood
I ain't playin dawg you better go test her blood
Until your positive she's negative don't make no love
With or without a glove, you know what I'm speaking of
The cub scouts try and jump into the briney shrubs
Behind the bush turn a back push into a shove
What you thinking trying bring the underground above?
AOI make you cry like a dove,for that shit,for that shit

(chorus)[Verse 1]
(I talk a lot of shit, but I can back it all the fuck up)
I don' talk about it really, but I’m still the illest
Still the baddest
Bless the apparatus I got silverback gorilla status
I pull the one red string that runs through your mattress
And make your bed springs sing a song of sadness
Sad sack of shit, pack your things and go
I’m hopping freight trains with nothing but a bindle (no hobo)
Little homie said ‘'YOLO’‘ — no props
I photobomb your photo ops busting out the robocop
Teach me how to dougie, kid, I’d rather do the knowledge
Now go home and get your shine box, you got a couple shoes to polish
Undergrad, this ain’t no humblebrag
I’ve sung one too many Johnny come latelies, now baby come to dad
Cause he don’t need no cheat code to go beast mode
All he really needs is a M-I-C to freak flow
(I talk a lot of shit, but I can back it all the fuck up)
I’m a runner up, if I’m not top billing, I’m show stealing
Sistine Chapel vandal type, tag the whole ceiling
Sick of hearing rap with no feeling
Sick of trauma porn addicts thinking they’re poets, that’s not soul bearing
Break yourself, fix your face
My heartbeat breaks the 808’s, now update your database
So many Roc Raida tapes, not enough functional dual cassette decks
Who will you sweat next?
Stupid, I maneuver through a school full of rednecks
Some people I was cool with despite a few death threats
Sacrificed a social life, food and some rent checks
So I can grab a mic where the hell ever I like, and catch wreck
Yeah, I’ve got swung on from time to time
Been cornered in some clubs just for speaking my mind
Mental midgets couldn’t come up with the lyrics and rhymes
Now I’m back popping more shit than ever and I’m fine
Find me if you need me, son, I’m easy to locate
You finally gon' feed me then I’m eating that whole cake
Got license in movies and TV, that’s so great
Don’t break your coke-nail trying to throw weight, okay
Curb stomp your enthusiasm
Don’t expect resolutions just cause every movie has ‘em
Don’t expect revolution from the music
That is solely created for the sake of booty clapping
Fool, keep rapping
Release the kraken, beat back the back beat
Planning instrumentals, running my mouth at the track meet
My victory lap shows no mercy in this dojo
Spinning back, kick the Willie Bobo
Sweep the head, breaking bread with the best of 'em
Crumbs are left under the table for the rest of 'em
I don’t speak in metaphysics cause I’m not a metaphysicist
I’ll diss the living shit out of these so called lyricists
Fuck y'all

[Hook]
(Y’ll don’t like it, kiss my ass you don’t like it, this my house
‘Cause we don't need no cheat codes to go beast mode
All he really needs is a M-I-C to freak flow)


[Verse 2]
Excuse me for having ethics, I don’t eff with little toys
I learned to scratch on phonographs [?]
A killjoy, crying over spilled soy milk
I destroy the shit brick house that you droids built
You walk tall ‘til I kick out your stilts
Buff 'til I call your bluff and pull up your kilt
You’ve been padding your resume
While I’ve been rhyming about life like I’m rapping my death away
Stay well composed, figuratively, literally
They prefer a hashtag to metaphor, simile
Brag-rap to poetry, backtrack to symphony
Sweet talk the sour puss press and push bitterly
The kids are getting degraded, they ain’t diminish me
Oh uh, but they prefer the skinny me
I’m an emotional leader of the emcees who sit in salt
Fuck being complicated, Uncle Sage is difficult
It’s a cult of personality stuck in a false reality
It’s all a bunch of mall punk and dance club rap to me
Swagger jacking, black cracker, battle rap is gone minstrel
Born on third base acting like they hit a triple
With a wiffleball bat walking pretty, talking pretty
With no act, in fact, it’s all theory
I promised you death threats, don’t actually kill me
But bite my dog, I'mma scratch your kitty

[Outro]
It’s like that, y'all, it’s like that, y'all
It’s like that-that-that, it’s like that, y'all
It’s like that, y'all, it’s like that, y'all
It’s like that-that-that, it’s like that, y'all
Talk shit[Slug]
A room full of happy sot
Come see what daddy got
Players on the sideline
Screaming out "That ain't hot!"
Drama, what got you the answers in the first place
Pants held tight with a shoelace
Keep life in a suitcase
Handle broken off
Dick stay soft and a brand new smoker's cough
Over and over, dodge that boulder
The best type of baby powder pimp man soldier
Wake up from sleep, climb down from my treehouse
Get into your lawn and pull the weeds out
If it ain't been fixed I ain't gon' break it
But hot damn, woman, you look good naked
(Take it) off the record, I got them records
I'm not impressed
I want my fucking hasenpfeffer and my Dr. Pepper
Doctor, doctor

[Sage Francis]
What's the deal, dunny?
You got some real problems?
Show me some real money

[Slug]
I like my black girls clean and my white girls dirty
Doesn't matter, either way they're all out to hurt me
So what's the deal, girl, can I talk to you?
Cause I got a head full of voices telling me that that's what I ought to do
(Why don't you give that girl shit a little bit of a break?)
I do, twenty times a day - I call 'em cigarette breaks
But my heart, my head and my balls ache
From trying to pile on the weight to see how much she can take

[Sage Francis]
Mama never told me all they wanted was a daddy
Baby I could look just like him, maybe even act exactly
How he did. Uninterested, out of touch with what your mama needs
Hard to get through to, hard to please
Hard at work avoiding the family, talking to his secretary's tits
Measure the distance of pleasure mixed with business trips
As usual eyes wander, unscrupulous minds ponder
Possible outcomes over time('s on our side)
Some stop to smell flowers but they're toxic
I don't punch clocks, I knock 'em out the box, Rick (knock 'em out, Rick)
Then some jock until I start the moshpit
Ladies' night at CBGB's hitting on punk rock chicks
Like blaow, how you like me now?
Inscribe my digits in my steel toe so you don't have to write 'em down
Embed it in your head to help you remember, it might help
Slight swells on your back from the cracks of a spiked belt
Trendy poser, she ain't mad at me
"Bend me over, spank me, daddy"
Disciplinary measures existing in every treasure
That's why I keep digging (digging, digging, digging)

[Slug]
You better kill me now before I turn around and blow up right in your face (4x)(Sage)
You can't kill me, motherfucker
You can't kill me, motherfucker
You may try, but you will die
You can't kill me, motherfucker

Go to bed late, then I have to wake
Get to work, keep it goin', can't stop, can't take a break
Gotta get it done, in time for me to do the things I wanna do
But in the time I finished it, it's time for me to talk to you
And then explain what I do in my day, well
It's complicated and you say, "Pray tell"
And now we'll try, if I miss any details
Think about it later and send it in an email
Cause my brain is on a loop, but there's a buzz
That I need to troubleshoot, not now
Gotta gotta get the work done
Last item of the day is turnin' to the first one
I, never gonna never gonna
I, never gonna never gonna
I, ain't gonna ever gonna die

Huh, pedal to the medal, gonna get ahead
Gonna run another red light in the dead of the night
Lettin' the light from my cellphone distract my eyes
Sexual text message into my mind
Fingers are busy, but now I'm lookin' in the mirror
Cause the people behind me, they're givin' me the middle finger
I'm kill'em if they pull up any closer to my bumper
Short-tempered mother... shut your mouth!
Drinkin' the coffee, now I'm dumpin' it out
He's honkin' the horn like "You wanna throw down"
He thinks, "Oh boy, you wanna go now"
I'm ready (I'm ready), for the typically cyclical simple civil obedience
Typically cyclical simple civil obedience
Typically cyclical simple civil obedience
(di-di-di-difficult isn't it)

I'm a just man, with a company van
And a supervisor who just does a summary scan
And a coworker who's always like "Discover me man"
In the morning we all get in the huddle again
Like "Can we even make more money"
I wonder what the luxury is really taken from me
I don't even have to worry (ha-ha-ha-hiiii)

Typically cyclical simple civil obedience
Typically cyclical simple civil obedience
Typically cyclical simple civil obedience
Typically cyclical simple civil obedient people
Are gonna die, cause they can't live my life

All eyes on the small guys makin' small noise
In a small town with the small music men
They're just fall guys, in the law's eyes
Your voice is worth more than you know and you're not foolin' anyone
I'm not a con-artist, your pencil and promises is eroding eraser tips
I'm sick of your colleges, expensive taste tester, "Spit that wine"
Excessive waste, yes, but it's that time
For me to get randomly checked again
Bored until you're marked with a blood-red pen
Water bottle sittin' in my pocket and I'm walkin' with a grin
Cause the liquid isn't permitted, I'm rippin' up the ticket
For the lady at the counter as confetti in her face
Shoulda never let me in this place
Fly, fly boy in the brownest state
I feel I'm never gonna be let out the gate, because I'm the bomb
Yea I said it; cool, collected and calm
Maneuver through the computer to do a little song
My music got the charm, smoother than a cougar
Attack the mic and get on the intercom

Hello passengers, fellow activists, whether you're masochists
Mellow pacifists, tell those faxin' it, it's no accident
By the end of this record, you're gonna know

Typically cyclical simple civil obedience
Typically cyclical simple civil obedience
Typically cyclical simple civil obedience
Typically cyclical simple civil obedient people

Are you listenin', love? We got a 30 for us
Can you hand me enough, can you hand me my stuff
Bout to move out this scary cemetery you trust
Livin' just a little bit of it isn't nearly enough
Livin' just a little bit of it isn't nearly justified
Because ah-ah-ah-I, ah-ah-ah-I am
Never gonna never gonna never gonna never gonna die

(Sage Speaking)
I wanna kee- I wanna keep making things an-and death really is
Is uh not to be part of my eh-eh-everyday activities
It's not to be in my music anymore, I don't want it there
It'll-it'll sneak its way in and out, but that's that's, we're beyond that
I mean de-de-death only as a concept is what matters and-and
God as a concept is-is-is one of those huge things to me
And to you, I know you, I know you much better than you think I do uhh
I hope we meet sometime, I'd love to shake your hand and um maybe get a kiss
Uh right there, on my face
And uh I don't know maybe have sex a little bit[Intro]
Death be not proud, though some have called thee
Mighty and dreadfull, for, thou art not soe
For, those, whom thou think'st, thou dost overthrow
Die not, poore death, nor canst thou kill mee

[Hook]
Clickety clack, clickety clack
Gather my things, and I quickly attack
Sword in my sheath, knife in my back
Keep enemies closer than where friends are at

Rose in my mouth, the petals are black
One armored suit, the metal's intact
Come fully strapped with a skull wooly hat
Just picture that, clickety clack
Now I find my location and unfold a map
My index inspects it and follows the path
My horse is on loan, and I borrowed a staff
From some mystical wizard, I will give it back
But I'm off to the races, my face has got cracks
Worn out and weathered like a red leather mask
I've been through the storm, future, present and past
Light as a feather, swift as a cat
Cold as a rock, you know not what you nicked from my sack
Little bastard, you'll get skinned for that
And you'll swim with the fishes once I finish this task
No strings attached, clickety clack

[Hook]

Kicked myself in the ass for not bringing my axe
But I've got the flash paper and one single match
Light won't escape me, a fire will catch
You'll beg and you'll plead, you'll scream and you'll scratch
But nothing can save you, you need to relax
I'll keep you alive for a while, feed you scraps
Love you like you deserve love, with some smacks
A kick and a slap, clickety clack
It's no longer personal, I'm simply detached
From what's hurtful, I need to keep my business exact
Separate beings, I can see our differences are vast
And I can't bridge the gap, clickety clack
Built a rickety raft out of twigs and some grass
And I made it to shore just before it collapsed
Salute to this mission, take swigs from your flask
Tilt your glass, pick your poison, I'm poised to be fast
On your scent, picked it up just by sniffin' the tracks
Kept my ear to the ground and heard snickers and laughs
Adding insult to injury for your criminal acts
Now the cost of your freedom is a liberty tax

[Hook]

You should have known better than to be mingling with rats
Got a lead to your shack from some gypsies in the trash
Cryptic interactions, I asked them to stick to facts
Made a trade and gave them everything that I packed
Now there's a brick through your window, kid, sift through the glass
Notice the note in which the brick was wrapped
Explaining that I know how you're quick to the dash
But it won't be very long before you slip in my trap
Like a moth to the flame with its wings in the wax
It's hard to escape with your limbs in a cast
Your heart will deflate when your wrists both get slashed
And gradually I snap these synapses in half
Magnificent crescendo, the cymbals all crash
You'll pay for your deeds, but we don't accept cash
We will mix and match this for that, tit for tat
Gonna get it, get it back, gonna getcha getcha back

[Hook]Sun set and sun rise I'm my own personal light show
Flipping switches...moving from basin bottoms to plateaus
The Earth...manipulates itself beneath me
I stand still...stagnate. Can't kill...this lagged state

Life...manipulates itself around me, but I'm dead still
Upright...but dead still
Word is still born...I will not stoop to the level of the stoop that y'all chill on
If the building's boarded up and the children of the corn
-er Liquor Store don't want to kick it no more...
Because holes have filled the wall, sneakers are scuffed & toes have become sore

I saw y'all walk from the hood of tough luck
Yeah, if these walls could talk they wouldn't shut the fuck up

Jump in your pick up truck. Drive from the mountain range
Cash the chips in on your shoulder, cut your losses, die young, count the change
How strange...you think these clouds look lovely?
Smoke signals...manipulate themselves above me
No symbols...are below me enough to overlook
I know you read my every move, I wrote the book

Mind not the blemishes that are on my premise. Endlessness is my "to be continued..."
Notice the nervousness in my footnotes when being interviewed
Shaking uncontrollably. "How you doing?" "Not bad...how about you?"
Brought it right back to me like "What've you been up to?"

I don't talk to freaks. I even ignore my neighbors who live down the stairs
I walk the streets. And they don't know that I'm famous in 2000 years
So I say shit loud in their ears and I spit a wretched verse in their face...
Disrespecting their personal space
In a split second, curtains and drapes get closed
They think they've shut me out, but I can see their ugly mouth in the shape of "O"s
I'd break their windows with a stone that has a note attatched
That says "I hate Jim Crow, and here's a poem to let you know the haps:"

"I've got a golden axe and I chop cherry trees down
Dead to this world. Bury me now."

I am from a distant place that sits and waits for my belated time to come
But its too late I've missed my fate. I "F" with the deaf, blind and dumb
My father taught me one thing...how to fire a gun
I don't bother...this is survival for fun

I have become the most sinister sin city clicker
Cynical dim witted trixter
Critical shit grinning hipster
Whisper...to my earhole...tell me not to be fearful
Be careful
Not to make any...sudden...movements
Show me your sole...I like to study shoe prints

You've stepped to me before! I can recognize them stubby toes!
I left them guys with bloody clothes. For a second time...nobody knows
The pain I've seen. Nobody knows the pain I've seen
Nobody knows why I've got a bloody nose or how they made it bleed

Chorus:
Climb trees...go out on a limb
To find me...forget about him
Forget about hymns...what are those psalms that you sing
What are those songs that are in your head echoing...

I am not here to make a change. I break chains
I break dance moves and move Strange--
Strange Famous is infamous for inflammatory mission statements
Living in basements with subterranean secret service agents
With little patience. A pediatrician who hate kids
Women's lib is getting choked to death by their own baby bibs
Baby, did you know I love women who hate mankind?
I talk about it all the damn time....keep it comin' HUH!!!

"IIIIIIIII HHHHAAAAAAAATE MEEEEEEEENNNNN"

This conversation is mine. I own all the stock in boring small talk
And I've trade marked this facial expression called the "gawk."
So fuck off. I dis functions souped by ninjas and hockey fights
While discussion groups infringe upon my copyrights
All them bitches want me tonight...I've been so great and respectful
They only get salty when I bend them into the shape of a pretzel
I make them flexible when I break their schedule. It only got hard...
When I asked 'em politely not to fight me and to give up...God
Damn...this is easier than I thought it would be
They'll attend any party and not fight it as long as they're invited cordially
Unfortunately, I've only got so many hundred openings
But talk to me, I want to take you all under my broken wings

Who's the right man for the job?!
Put up your hands y'all because I'm not tall enough to stand up to God

Who's the right woman?! Throw up one hand...and wave it now[Verse 1]
Let me rub my back against the notches on your bedpost
Scratch these afterthoughts off my flesh and shed ghosts
My head's close to your closet door, I've got the glass to my ear
My nose is in your business I smell something fishy here
I hear bones rattling. Poems battling for space and time
Phones that'll ring when I make judgment calls with pick-up lines
Sexual hang-ups leave me waiting nude and while alone
It just gets aggravating masturbating to a dial tone
I'm the home to run-away trains of thought
My one track mind is a collision inter-course where victims cross
Bedroom eyes...Uncross their legs exposing inner thighs
I disrobe and show my most convincing disguise
I've lived so many lives each death has left my face scarred
Hid so many lies under my breath that I can't face God
Dig into my mind deep enough you'll find a graveyard
I get nervous bodies will resurface every time it rains hard
"Don't cry, girl." Let me outline your short comings
While my world is full of them and they're all in the long runnings
It's all fun and games. It's all done in vain. It's all a fucking shame
I ain't the one but I'm the one to complain?

[Hook]
I'm the one to come home. Compare. Contrast
Come fast. Make love to the present, fuck the past
Make love to the present, fuck the past. Nothing lasts
Don't you dare worry about the morning aftermath (yeah!)

[Lead-in]
Don't you love how much you paid for your education? (yeah)
Don't you love your job and spending every day there? (yeah)
Don't you love your girl? You have such a healthy relationship. (yeah)
Don't you love having that break-up sex, that make-up sex? (yeah)

[Verse 2]
Taking an acid bath, pissing on the shower curtain
The gal just laughs and starts dissing my towel turban
I had to ask if she knew how to listen now I'm certain
Now my task is just to get up in her like I was a surgeon!
I'm a virgin who makes exceptions at sunset
My dirty skin gets cleansed by the summer sweat
"Self, have some respect! I don't need you new and clean
But I don't want the procedure routine!"
A screw machine! with a few bolts loose. Robot response touch tone
Hair trigger, happy-go-lucky emotion monger wants a love poem
Run home. Dip into your closet and jump bones
Your secret admirer's stuck higher up and he's unknown
Looking down on you. Can you bare the burden?
My ears are hurting. I found a few gears are turning
With squeaky wheels. They get the grease cause its a damn nuisance
Understand the blueprints for our mechanical movements
It never ran smooth since we abused the Earth
Grabbed a hand full of pubics and removed the turf
Refused its worth, we lose our shirts. She assumed the worst
And needed proof of birth? I'm leaving this universe
It seems doomed and cursed. See if you come first then come fast
Come here. Come back. Compare. Contrast
Complain. Constrain. Constantly ask
Complicated questions contain scientific answers in your flask
Condone. Condemn. Come home. Come friend
Confuse. Common issues. Condelude. Comprehend
Karma. Chameleon. Come again?
Continue to come in you. Come to daddy. Condescend
Come and bring us (Confidence). Cunnilingus (Compliments)
Come to think us went from guilty consciousness to common sense
Calm down. Complete. Compound. Come eat
Our Common ground meat from man-made concrete

[Hook]
Come to the street. Conquer the weak. Come to terms with coming last
Make love to the present, fuck the past
Make love to the present, fuck the past. Nothing lasts
Don't you dare worry about the morning aftermath. (yeah!)

Don't you wanna take a shower with me? Clean me up. (yeah)
Kill yourself...while you're still alive
(Kill yourself) while you're still alive while you're still alive. (3X)

[Poetry]
See when you put a shell to your ear, it is not the sound of crashing waves
That you're hearing. It's the amplified current of your own bloodstream
It was your self-pulse that created that post-human illusion of me. Your
Tireless heart pumping out an ocean of lies and I foolishly tried filling
Impossible shoes resulting in my stumbling as I fell into the trap of making
A woman my element. Now I just can't get comfortable being out of you...
