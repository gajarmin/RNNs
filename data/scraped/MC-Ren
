[Produced by Logic]

[Hook]
Work so fucking much my greatest fear is I'mma die alone
Every diamond in my chain, yeah, that's a milestone
People calling me, asking me for money, man
The only thing I'mma give you motherfuckers is the dial tone

[Verse 1]
Flashbacks of a youngin' sipping that purple Kool Aid
Skipping school with my homies and chiefing reefer for two days
Running from the law, living how I'm living, fuck 'em all
Bumping Triple Six
Hennessy in my cup, driving through the sticks
Who the bitch riding with me?
Man, the devil tryna get me
Motivated, under-educated, and hated
But finally getting cake like a happy belated
Bitch I made it, we on
Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, smoke it, inhale it
Write it, record it, mix it, master it, press it up, unveil it
Feel like I've been waiting forever, forever to inherit
This is war, I declare it
Time is money, I can't spare it
Futuristic, so simplistic
Please decipher my linguistics
Slow it down, Robitussin
I'm the king, ain't no discussion
And now we blowing up like spontaneous human combustion
My consumption is the illest
Section eight, I know you feel this
On the come up,  where they run up on you for nothing at all
Brighter than eleven suns, this the first, where my funds?
EBT, that's the card
I thank God, I thank God, but it's hard, but it's hard

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
God damn, god damn, we at it again
Me and my homies that know me blowing up like the Taliban
Yeah, my stress up, but I'm blessed up
Fuck around and get messed up
When I murder the rhyme, I'm living divine
You know that I'm one of a kind
Lemme get it right now, ho
Draped up and I'm dripped out, right now, ho
Caked up 'til I cash out and I got 'em all wondering how, so
On the down low, haters drown slow
On the down low, haters drown slow
Oh God, my God, we got it all right
Oh God, my God, we gotta get it, right?
These fuckers facades, they just a mirage, right?
I said these fuckers facades, they just a mirage, right?
Tell me that they love me, know damn well that they don't give a fuck
I be on that finger flipping killing shit up in the cut
That's what's up
All these bitches out here tryna gas it up
This is everything I ever wanted, I can't pass it up
Life changed in a year, couldn't happen fast enough
"Can I do it like you do it?" That's what they be asking us
White Benz, black card, bitch better get your plastic up
Man, this shit is hella hard, but we never acting up
Live it up, hold on to your dream, don't ever give it up
Finally had my share of success, and shit, I can't get enough
Now they know my name through the nation
Cause my single like that good shit, man, always in rotation
Now they know Logic for Logic, not through my affiliations
Stacking profit on profit, from this music I'm making
Even Jesus had haters, so when you feeling forsaken
Tell 'em jealous Judas is who this is, and man, that'll break 'em
And bitch I'm still the same
Dash of auto tune so y'all can feel the pain
Broke as fuck, back in that basement, not a dollar to my name
Chasing fame, chasing glory, 'til the day we make a story
Positive that life ain't mine, bitch you can take that shit to Maury

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
(Hello, no one is available to take your call)
I been working hard, I been searching for God
I been working hard, I been searching for God
(Please leave a message after the tone)
Little brother, this is your sister, you're busy, I get you
But I insist you call me back cause I miss you
I wish you well, well, I wish you would call
Cause lately it feel like I’m just not your sister at all, all
I’m sorry for calling and bawling, I’m all in
And I feel like I'm falling lately, it feel like my children hate me
You tell me I'm beautiful and yet no man wanna date me
Haunted by vivid memories of that man who raped me
And lately I, I feel more and more like mommy, I know I’m me, but still
You always seemed to pick up the phone and somehow I feel
Better, but you been answering me lesser and lesser
So I resorted to the pills in my dresser, I'm gone
As as for [?] he left and he ain't coming back
I hate the man, if I see him I swear I tell him that
No longer cooking crack in my kitchen, cutting, selling that
He broke my heart, that relationship been to hell and back
I been working hard, I been searching for God
I can feel the Devil around me as they all applaud
Promise you won't forget me, that you'll always be with me
And even when you gone I can call whenever he hit me
Under pressure, I've been feeling under pressure

[Verse 4]
Hey, son, this is your father, don't mean to bother
How are you? Heard you were in town, but I never saw ya
Tried to call ya, where are ya?
In Paris? What a beautiful destination
To parish right by the Eiffel, come now, please don't be spiteful
Of all my small talk, I think we're overdue a long talk
When I see kids around the way I say how I'm your dad
It gets me thinking of incredible moments we've had
And on the real I'm trying so hard not to bug you
But do you think you could stop rapping about my drug use?
I'm two years clean, no longer a fiend
Yeah, I'm 57, but I feel 19
And I love you I swear, Bobby, I know you're there
And when the time is right I know that you gon' take care
Of anything I need, of your family
Can I have some tickets to your next show?
Would you stand with me?
Can I have some money for my new honey that's hella fine?
I forgot to mention I got divorced from your step-mom
My mind going crazy, but I still look hella calm
Maybe you could tell *beep*
I've been feeling under pressure

[Interlude]
Hey, what's up, bro? This Ralph, I didn't want much, man, just calling to see what's going on. I know you're busy. Dad hit me up, it's his birthday today, but I know you know that. Yeah, he calling, he be tryna introduce me to his new chick and stuff, man, I don't know how to handle that. I don't wanna tell him like nah, I ain't trying to meet her off top, you know. So what you think I should do? Text me, I know you're busy, dawg. But he been calling me saying he wanna come down, he wanna bring his new chick and Brenda's like "damn, he really tryna rock out with his new chick" cause you know we all talk to Debbie. But I don't know, I don't know how to tell him this shit so just hit me back whenever you got the time, man, I know there's more shit on your plate. You ain't gotta hit me, dawg, but if you do I'd appreciate it. When you back, love you, do your thing. Swag RattPack all day, boy. Alright, nigga

[Verse 5]
Yeah, dear family, I'm so sorry that I've been distant
Everything changed in an instant, my time has been inconsistent
I know that you been insisting, I know that birthday I missed it
I swore I told my assistant, but I guess my mind is in another place
Thoughts often in another world, I started seeing another girl
It fell through, man, what a world
But I'm so focused on my craft, on employing my staff
Such a perfectionist, I can't even finish this draft
This letter to the ones I love, the ones that I miss
Brothers and sisters that hit me up just to reminisce
Meanwhile people outside of my blood asking for favors
I don't owe you a fucking thing, you best switch your behavior
Truly remarkable how I barely know you, but somehow owe you When you don't even know 'bout the shit I go through
We ain't spoken in a while, tell me sister, how your child?
Come now, girl, give me a smile, come on, girl, don't do me foul
Sorry I ain't call before, but I'm calling you right now
I heard that you was popping E, stop resorting to the vowel
How my mama, how she doing, does she know what I'm pursuing?
I ain't talk to her in years, that relationship she ruined
But sometimes I wake and wonder just what the fuck I'm doing
They say family is everything, I swear that shit the truth
I should spend it all with y'all, but I spend it in the booth
This is everything I love, this is everything I need
Never sacrifice this feeling even though my heart it bleed
This is everything I love, everything I need
Never sacrifice this feeling even though my heart bleed
Under pressure, I've been feeling under pressure

[Interlude]
Hey, son, I'm sorry I missed your call today, but I was in an AA meeting. A friend of mine was celebrating four years so I couldn't get you right then. And then when I did call you weren't able to answer or whatever. Just wondering how things are going. Jenn and I aren't together anymore. Living on my own, you know. Anyway, the whole family, even the family that you don’t know, my sisters and your aunts that you've never met are very proud of you. Your cousins just love you too. Anyway, son, I love you, I just want you to know that. And just keep grinding, you know. And I don't wanna hear you joining the Illuminati cause then I gotta kill ya. I love you, son, bye[Ice Cube]

Y'all niggas gotta recognize, yaknahmsayin?
Niggas don't wanna peep game, yaknahmsayin?
But this shit come all the way back around here
My nigga Dre, droppin' heat box on y'all bitch-ass
Yaknahmsayin? You gotta recognize
L.A. niggas, connected all over the motherfucking world, nigga
Recognize this; peep game

[Time Bomb]
Now in my younger days I used to sport a rag
Backpack full of cans plus a four-four mag
G'd up from the feet up
Blue'd up from the shoe up's how I grew up
Loc'n, smokin' and drinkin' til we threw up (threw up)
At Leimert Park, taggin', hittin' fools up
Ditching my class, just to fuck yo' school up
You don't wanna blast, nigga tuck yo' tool up
But don't sleep, y'all niggas quick to shoot you
Now there's another motherfucker with no future
But Time Bomb much smoother when I maneuver, dope like Cuba
Got em jumpin Disciples to the Hoover

[King T]
I'm coming "Straight Outta Compton" with a loose cannon
Smoke big green, call it Bruce Banner
Watch your manners, at last another blast from the top notch
From way back with the pop rocks, I pop lock witcha
Picture this, Dr. Dre twisting wit Tha Liks
And Hittman bought a fix
Don't trip, it's a Time Bomb in this bitch
Here it tick tick tick tick {*BOOM*}
Wait a minute it's on, I tell it like a true mackadelic
Weed and cocaine sold separate, check it
From sundown to sunup -- clown and run up
The Aftermath'll be two in your gut, nigga what?

Chorus: Knoc-Turn'al, Kokane

We roll deep, smoke on weed drink and pack heat
Requirements for survival each day -- in L.A.!
It don't stop, we still mash in hot pursuit from the cops
Analyze why we act this way -- in L.A.!

[Hittman]
Gimme that mic fool, it's a West coast jack move
They call me Hitt - cause I spit like gats do
Cock me back
Bust caps for my Macz Crew, at Fairfax
Who used to wear Air Max shoes, that's true
But I grew up where niggas jack you, harass you
Blast you, for that set you claim (where you from?)
Mash on you for your Turkish chain, C.K. B.K
Blue'd up or flame, I ran wit a gang
I helped niggas get, jacked for they Dana Dane's
My pants hang below my waistline
I look humble wanna rumble? (yeah yeah)
I bang though, like Vince Carter from the baseline
Don't waste my time
Fuck a scrap in killa Cali, AK's and 9's
One-time's, sun-shines, and fine-ass bitches
Hawaiian Thai, drive-bys, six-fo's on switches

[Xzibit]
I was raised in the hood called WHAT-THE-DIF'
Where the brothers in the hood, refused to go Hollywood
Slugs for the fuck of it
Anybody hatin' on us can suck a dick
If I catch you touching mine you catch a flat-line, dead on the floor
Better than yours, driving away gettin' head from a whore
It's AvireX-to-the-Z
Fuckin' with me might get you banned from TV
Cassette and CD it's all mine the whole nine the right time
Multiply, we don't die, the streets don't lie
What, so neither do I, I'm bad for your health
Like puttin' a pistol up to your face and blastin' yourself

[Defari]
Five in the mornin', burglars at my do'
Glock forty-five in my dresser drawer
Let 'em come in BLAOW he see the thunder roll
Roll with niggas, who buy fifths by the fo'
And brew's by the case
SLAP YOU in the face with the bass, Dr. Dre laced
Likwit Kings wit Sedans and gold rings
Haters fold the style, but can't find no openings

Chorus

[Outro]
In L.A

That's how we ride (4X)[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
I got a taste for waste and a taste and a blood
Murder I heard her when she screamed the "Drop!"
Cause her son bust a slug
Relate this to no choice
And listen to this straight-up man before they ban the voice
While I rhyme to the rythym of a pop
Remember the first nigga that runs is the first to get shot
Whoever thinks that what I say and portray is negativity
Need to come kick it in the city with me
And find the black and crack de fact
And take that shit back cuz they don't wanna fuck with that
There's too many niggas they're tryin' to calm
If mothafuckaz could get it, nobody would've fuck with it
Appetite for destruction
For him to get a bit more shit he gotta commit -
Murder in the first degree - a man slaughter
Takin' a life of his wife and young daughter
A whole city of bitches, they look sucked up
And the niggas is killin', it's straight fucked up
Whoever sayin', what I'm sayin's for greed
The 9 even when they're tryin' to feed
My appetite for destruction

" .. you guys know who I'm talkin' to .. "

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
The Appetite is tremendous - so I'm gonna spin this
Drop up some violence because they ax me to end this
Some trouble that I cought cuz I was noisy
A nigga tried to take advantage because I'm de kamikaze
He took de swing from my hand - thought I was faded
Start runnin' for the door but the fucker never made it
The sound of the 9 went BANG [shot]
And all over the wall was his mothafuckin' brain
Cause I'm a nigga you can't sleep on
So set the alarm, cause I'm hittin' like a mothafuckin' bomb
I do damage with the 9 in my hand
But the average nigga that don’t know me don’t understand
I'm from the streets so therefor
You know I don't care for
A sucker that ain't down with the real niggas the niggas the niggas
Yo, and after when the shit gotta go ain't even sober
Any time that the 9 wanna leave
I got a .38 hittin' down the sleeve
And it's ready to go to war cuz that's what it's here for
I shoot down a milion niggas and shoot one more
And that's the milion and one
They couldn't hang with the appetite
Cause they was'nt rappin' right
So I had to destroy whoever was standin' in my presence
For fuckin' up de asses appetite for destruction

[Interlude]
"Cops put a hurtin' on your ass, man, you know, they really degrade you. White folks don't believe that shit, they don't believe that cops degrade you
[Imitating white person] Oh come on, those people, those people are resisting arrest."

[Verse 3: Eazy-E]
Check it out y'all, in the house y'all
So I can show and flow and let the people know
So won't you ease on down to the yellow brick road to Compton
But first let me tell you somethin' -
I possess to 10 commandments of the Hip Hop thugsta
Known as the thief and murderer :
First one -
Honor thy nigga with an attitude
Gotta get respect or break your mothafuckin' neck
Second one -
Allwayz gotta fuck out of wedlock
I like it when the pussy goes snack crack and pop
Number three -
I'm a gangsta fanatic
I smoke any foolz tryin' to cause some statix
Number four -
Here's what's the score
A crazy-ass nigga that remains hardcore
Fifth one -
My kill has just begun
I pull out my gun that will keep me on the run
Step six -
Hmmm, it's kinda tricky -
Can't forget that I'm mothafuckin' chickenshit
To the ones who tries to play the E -
By the time you reach Seven you'll be 6 feet deep
Number eight -
Make no mistake
Move real sneaky and you're bound to catch your prey
Ninth one -
I gotta be raw, fuck any brain once your man made law
Last but not least, I must be real -
Number ten - is my appetite to ki ...(Intro)
Yo man there's alot of brothers out there
Flakin and perpatratin who scared to kick reality
Yo Dre you've been doin all this dope producin'
You ain't had a chance to show 'em what time it is
So watch do you want me to do...
All you got to do now, express yourself

(Verse 1)
I'm expressin' with my full capabilities
Now I'm livin' in correctional facilities
Coz some don't agree wit how I do this
I get straight, meditate, like a Buddhist
I'm droppin' flavor, my behavior is hereditary
But my technique is very necessary
Blame it on Ice Cube, because he said it gets funky
When you got a subject and a predicate
Add it on a dope beat, and it'll make ya think
Some suckers just tickle me pink, to my stomach
Cause they don't flow like this one
You know what, I won't hesitate to dis one or two before I'm through
So don't try to sing this
Some drop science, well I'm droppin' English
Even if Yella, makes it a-capella
I still express, yo I don't smoke weed or sess
Cause its known to give a brother brain damage
And brain damage on the mic don't manage nuttin'
But makin' a sucker and you equal
Don't be another sequel

(Hook)
Express yourself
Do it good
Express yourself
Oh do it

(Ice-Cube Interlude)
Ice Cube, is not for the pop charts
So where should a brother like you start expressin' yourself
My boy'll show you how Yo Dre

(Dr. Dre)
What up?

(Ice Cube)
Drop English right about...

(Verse 2, Dr. Dre)
Now, gettin' back to the PG
That's Program, and it's easy
Dre is back, New Jacks are made hollow
Expressin' ain't their subject because they like to follow the words
The style, the trend, the records I spin
Again and again and again
Yo ya on the other end
Watch a brother playin' dope rhymes, with no help
There's no fessin' and guessin' while I'm expressin myself
It's crazy to see people be what society wants 'em to be
But not me
Ruthless, is the way to go, they know
Others say rhymes that fail to be original
Or they kill where the hip-hop starts
Forget about the ghetto, and rap for the pop charts
And those musicians, curse at home
But scared to use profanity, when up on the microphone
Yeah they want reality, but you won't hear none
They rather exaggerate a little fiction
Some say no to drugs, and take a stand
But after the show they go lookin for the dope man
Oh they ban my group from the radio
Hear N.W.A. and say ''Hell no!''
But you know it ain't all about wealth
As long as you make a note to
(express yourself)

(Hook)
Express yourself
Do it do...
Express yourself
Oh do it!

(MC Ren Interlude)
A lyricist, yo Dre is the name for it
To make somethin' dope on a record that's what he came for
Kickin' reality yo but staying hisself
But it's important to keep it in mind to
(express yourself)

(Verse 3, Dr. Dre)
From the heart if you wanna start to move up the chart then
Expression is big part of it
You ain't efficient when you flow, you ain't swift
Movin' like a tortise, full of rigor mortise
There's a little bit more to show
I got rhymes in my mind, embedded like an embryo
Or a lesson, all of them expression
And if you start fessin', I got a Smith&Wesson for ya
I might ignore you're record, because it has no bottom
I get loose in the Summer, Winter, Spring and Autumn
It's Dre on the mic gettin physical
Doin' the job, NWA is the lynch mob
Yes I'm macabre, but you know you need this
And the knowledge is growin' just like a fetus
Or a tumor, but here's the rumour, Dre's in the neighborhood and he's up to no good
When I start expressin myself, Yella slam it
Cause if I stay funky like this, I'm doin damage
Or I'mma be too hyped, I need a straight jacket
I got knowledge, and other suckers lack it
So when you see Dre, a DJ on the mic
Ask what it's like, it's like we gettin' hype tonight
Cause if I strike, It ain't for your good health
But I won't strike if you just
(express yourself)

(Hook)
Express Yourself
Do it good...
Express Yourself
Oh do it[Dre]
Yo man I don't think they heard you
Why don't you tell 'em what ya name is

[Eazy-E]
My name is Eazy yeah this is true
Keepin' your attention is what I'm gonna do
Hardcore yo I could never be soft
Askin' me my defin' they say the boy goes off
Fillin' up my memo with the touch of my rhyme
Suckaz stayin' with me cause they know the time
Quiet on the set because I'm about to begin
And if you didn't hear me boy I'll tell you again
My name is Eazy or just call me E
But It doesn't really matter to me
Cause I'm the same person
Whether serious or rehearsin'
I just gotta keep cursin'
This is for the radio so I better chill
They won't play it if I co get ill
But I'm like that and thats an actually fact
Because the street is where my heart is at
Yo I don't do dope but I'm dope not a dope
But I'm doper than anybody who tries to cope
If the rhyme I'm displayin'
And the beat that's playin'
Yo you could try all day
And you still won't match up with the Ruthless P.O.W
Cause Eazy's doin it Compton style
Thats the city and you say you could get some
Yo it's Eazy-er Said Than Dunn

[Hook]
Wooooooo!
Wooooooo!

[Eazy-E]
Now it's easy for me to get my point across
So listen up close if ya don't ya might get lost
I'm not a role model or a Dr. Seuss yo I'm a gangsta
And I'm about to get stupid
I guess its time for the trama
With the E-A-Z-Y-E comma now that's drama
So pay attention by the way I must mention
I'm comin' off hard in the third demention
With the glare
But you don't need no glasses to stare
It'll probably take you in and it's just like your there
With the E on the gangsta tip
So if you think I'm a flip or slip don't even trip
Cause I'm a destroyer
My homie Dre is a doctor not a lawyer
Dope mc employer on Ruthless and thats my label
To get the money, the women, and co bust the fat cable's
Boy, master rhymers of toys
I mean str8 while ya suckin' with the girls enjoy
You must be sick or ya lonely
How ya gonna diss me if ya don't even know me
(Eazy - E: Yo Ren)
(M.C. Ren: What sup)
Get the gat show 'em where it's at
And that's just the sound
And next time I'm peelin ya cap
To let ya know where I'm comin' from
Eazy said it and it shall Be Dunn

[Hook]
Wooooooo!
Wooooooo!

[Eazy-E]
Radio jams are the part of the cycle
Eazy-er said than Dunn yeah thats the title
Rubbin' the lady's only the fly ones ya know
(M.C. Ren: but what if she's ugly)
Eazy come Eazy go
Don't ask to battle me home boy what's that
You wanna battle me boy ya better be strapped
Cause where I'm from it ain't all about that playin'
[*gun shots*]
Now that's what I'm sayin'
Said before that I was born in '73
Now everybody want's to know the A-G-E
Girls on the tip fellaz too it seemed
Had everybody thinkin' I was only 15
The fellaz would annoy me
The ladyz would adore me
And what was I to do
I wishin' nothin' lady's do
Cause the ladyz I luv 'em
Nice and then soft
I hate male groupies so just step the hell off
I'm the real Eazy cause others be fakin'
Tryin' to game fame off the name I'm makin'
Sayin' on your records you could get some
Yo home boy its Eazy-er Said Than Dunn

[Repeated]
MC Ren, MC Ren is a killa of the crafted men

[Laywiy]
It was the night before the bomb strike
And all the snakes was outta sight
And of all those cat hangs
And all the solutions
Now it's like do or die
So submit to the battle cry
And all the real niggas step up to the frontline
See, we don't want two scoops or fruit loops
We looking for real troops
Cause it's about a quarter to midnight
15 ticks to catch 15 licks in the fizzot
We letting the hatchets chop and the Mac-10's pop pop
For all those too slow for the tempo of rizzide
Because all those who can't hang get hung
And those who can't do the job get thumped
So come and walk, coming strong
Coming long, cause we been down for too damn long
And I'm a soldier, a soldier
Nigga I thought somebody told ya
Cause the days of being a slave living in the grave is over
Ain't no more we shall overcome, cause we been overcame
So I'm packing clips full of bullets
For all you these years trapped in chains
Listen to the sound of the midnight poker chain
Rolling on an underground railroad
Taking aim and set to cause much pain
So hitch a ride on the midnight trizzain
One million ways to die - so devil don't even try
I'm packed, ready and willing to get a devil a killa
So welcome to the land of the drive-by[Intro]
Eazy-E: Yo Dre where's the goddamn drum machine?
Dre: Ah shit, I left the motherfucker with Pooh
Eazy-E:You dumb motherfucker what the fuck we gonna do now?
Yella: Hey man I got some drums in the back
Dre: Man what the fuck is he talking bout
Ren: Yo does it look like we can play some fucking drums?
Yella: Man I can play the drums
Everyone else: Bullshit!
Yella: Man I used to fuck it up at Compton High
Ren: Give this nigga some sticks
Yo Fuck it up Yella

[Verse 1: MC Ren]
Yo we're two hard motherfuckers
Taking out any punk ass suckers
Can you believe this? if so be frightened
Were strong as fuck, with the power of a titan
Setting a mark of destruction get it
So don't front, and say you ain't with it
You wanna rumble with us you can't hang
Because we're something like a two man gang
Starting some shit is what we do best
Just care about ourself and say fuck the rest
So yo Eazy, bust it and shoot to kill
And tell these stupid motherfuckers the deal

[Verse 2: Eazy-E]
I look you dead in the eye then I spit
I tell you to your face punk you ain't shit
I don't give a god damn about feelings
I'm just happy just as long as I'm killing
A 187's in progress, nigga
Just as soon as I pull this trigger
Automatic heavily, I start firing
And the kids on the block, I'm the one they're admiring
A bad mouth nigga on the violent tip
I catch you talking some shit and I'mma bust your lip
Now who you gonna tell that I'm making you soft
The police ain't shit cause I'm paying 'em off
I move slow, always ready to go so fuck it
And bitches on my dick, they know that they can suck it
I'm a hardhead, always having a fit
When I'm not allowed to tear up shit
I'm a hard motherfucker

[Hook]
Two of the hardest motherfuckers
(Repeat x4)

[Verse 3: MC Ren]
Now look at me I'm a crazed bitch
With a gangster profanity pitch
Ren is a nigga that don't give a fuck
To a pussy ass fool trying to press his luck
I'm ready to scrap that's if you're ready to go
I'll take you out going toe to toe
E will start a conversion and hit you from the back
While you getting fucked by a ruthless jack
Critical condition is what you receive
Thinking of some back up to go and retrieve
But Eazy tell what would happen my man
(They would get fucked up by a ruthless clan)
So it's simple, we don't give a fuck right
So you and your boy can get the fuck out my sight
I'm on tilt with class getting ready to blast
Cause I'm a hard motherfucker

[Hook]

[Eazy-E]
Eazy and Ren is fucking it up again
Scheming up a plot before we begin
Because niggas like to stare like a bitch sometimes
They say how could them niggas have some hell of a rhymes

[M.C. Ren]
It's simple tell 'em what we mean
When the two baddest motherfuckers step on the scene

[Eazy-E]
Now this is some shit

[M.C. Ren]
Yo what are you saying

[Eazy-E]
You stupid motherfuckers, they think I'm playing
Talking all kind of shit of shit but I'm cracking it up
I can afford to laugh cause I'm backing it up
I'm not a buster I'm more like a hitman
So if you don't wanna throw then you can get down
You don't like the fuck away from me
So you can stop the shit, trying to fuck the E

[M.C. Ren]
You heard what he said and it's the truth so whats up
So if you want me to go well I'm about to nut up
The two baddest motherfuckers alive
So I don't think that you and your boys can survive
You gotta girl, well if she's good to go
I bet me and E already fucked the ho
A train was in effect and your bitch was rocked
By a hell of a nigga that was hard to stop

[Eazy-E]
Yo Ren lets jet let's get the fuck on out

[M.C. Ren]
Because everybody knows what we're talking about
We're two hard motherfuckers

[Hook][Intro]
Yeah, check this out, Ren is back in this mothafucka for 93'
For all ya'll punk ass niggas that thought I wasn't gonna do this shit
Back there talking all that shit, won't believe me and my shoots
Fuck all ya'll niggas cause I come back hard 93'
So all you punks mothafuckas check this out niggas!

[Verse 1]
I killed that bitch that waited 40 ounces
Start hitting my switches cause my fo' hit bounces
Lean to the side like a mack would do
Or I can come off like a G and mothafucka I'll jack you
Cause niggas be talking that shit cause
I'm fucking the rest and I can't scrap
Who needs to scrap, my niggas comming from the back
So bitches hold your panties up, tick your tits
Cause mothafucking Ren is making mothafucking hits
Still sporting cackies keep my dick in my dickies
Only wave them up when bitches wanna give them hickeis
Other than that, I'm looking up for number one
Cause number two I didn't trust, so my nigga had to bust
Burry him in the back another weedplants
My niggas said it was the reason why the weed is so dope
Grab another bitch twist the panties off the top
Open up my mouth and let the old english drop
Buzz for a minute, couldn't walk a straight line
But that shit don't stop Ren from writing a rhyme
And punk mothafuckas can't hide, from a nigga
Homicide all bullshit aside

[Hook]
Yeah, put the fucking bullshit aside
Yeah, put the fucking bullshit aside
Yeah, put the mothafucking bullshit aside
Yeah, put the mothafucking bullshit aside

[Verse 2]
Take donations from my niggas for the booth
I thinking of getting a case better yet I get two
Slap up the phone 6-3-2-15
Bitches ring the bell - it's a fucking tight jeans
A kiss on my chick, but my dick is getting jealos
She whispers she want suck and when we're not around de fellows
Fuck that shit, bitch, do what you gotta do
Cause when you're fucking with Ren ho my niggas peoples too
Now I'm zipping on my blue black car
Thinking of the times in the boulevard
I saw people out there getting ganked shit
Niggas shooting every night - niggas looting and shit
Sending niggas straight to the coffin
And this type of shit in the streets it's very often
The shit is like an everyday thang to me
A lot of niggas on my block I have them slang for me
But that ain't shit, my true niggas stay down
The plasma hard G's don't be fucking around
And why would you even think to hide
Nigga cause you got all bullshit aside, check it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Train came in in some cackey shorts
And he came up on the end at the basketball court
Taking niggas money shooting dice at the pawn
The mothafucka starts to leave when it starts to get dark
Cause bullets ain't got no mothafucking name
When he's shot by a nigga from my mothafucking game
The niggas in the house just kicking it
Bitches on their knees straight licking it
Ren is in control, bitches call me the messiah
I zip on some old drink fool so I can stay higher
Cakeys is krist, fresh from the surplus
My little nigga Bone starts to pull up a fass
So now they drunk his beer so he put out a tatoo
So we walk the tommy dog that's the will nigga anthem
So Juvi pass the movie it's "American Me"
The only movie that's allowed to be watched by a G
Now bitches just coming out of blocks and flats
So you can hear a smoking ho's your for rocks and blunts
Taking these bitches for a ride, treat them all like
Ho's all bullshit aside[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
I got a taste for waste and a taste and a blood
Murder I heard her when she screamed the "Drop!"
Cause her son bust a slug
Relate this to no choice
And listen to this straight-up man before they ban the voice
While I rhyme to the rythym of a pop
Remember the first nigga that runs is the first to get shot
Whoever thinks that what I say and portray is negativity
Need to come kick it in the city with me
And find the black and crack de fact
And take that shit back cuz they don't wanna fuck with that
There's too many niggas they're tryin' to calm
If mothafuckaz could get it, nobody would've fuck with it
Appetite for destruction
For him to get a bit more shit he gotta commit -
Murder in the first degree - a man slaughter
Takin' a life of his wife and young daughter
A whole city of bitches, they look sucked up
And the niggas is killin', it's straight fucked up
Whoever sayin', what I'm sayin's for greed
The 9 even when they're tryin' to feed
My appetite for destruction

" .. you guys know who I'm talkin' to .. "

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
The Appetite is tremendous - so I'm gonna spin this
Drop up some violence because they ax me to end this
Some trouble that I cought cuz I was noisy
A nigga tried to take advantage because I'm de kamikaze
He took de swing from my hand - thought I was faded
Start runnin' for the door but the fucker never made it
The sound of the 9 went BANG [shot]
And all over the wall was his mothafuckin' brain
Cause I'm a nigga you can't sleep on
So set the alarm, cause I'm hittin' like a mothafuckin' bomb
I do damage with the 9 in my hand
But the average nigga that don’t know me don’t understand
I'm from the streets so therefor
You know I don't care for
A sucker that ain't down with the real niggas the niggas the niggas
Yo, and after when the shit gotta go ain't even sober
Any time that the 9 wanna leave
I got a .38 hittin' down the sleeve
And it's ready to go to war cuz that's what it's here for
I shoot down a milion niggas and shoot one more
And that's the milion and one
They couldn't hang with the appetite
Cause they was'nt rappin' right
So I had to destroy whoever was standin' in my presence
For fuckin' up de asses appetite for destruction

[Interlude]
"Cops put a hurtin' on your ass, man, you know, they really degrade you. White folks don't believe that shit, they don't believe that cops degrade you
[Imitating white person] Oh come on, those people, those people are resisting arrest."

[Verse 3: Eazy-E]
Check it out y'all, in the house y'all
So I can show and flow and let the people know
So won't you ease on down to the yellow brick road to Compton
But first let me tell you somethin' -
I possess to 10 commandments of the Hip Hop thugsta
Known as the thief and murderer :
First one -
Honor thy nigga with an attitude
Gotta get respect or break your mothafuckin' neck
Second one -
Allwayz gotta fuck out of wedlock
I like it when the pussy goes snack crack and pop
Number three -
I'm a gangsta fanatic
I smoke any foolz tryin' to cause some statix
Number four -
Here's what's the score
A crazy-ass nigga that remains hardcore
Fifth one -
My kill has just begun
I pull out my gun that will keep me on the run
Step six -
Hmmm, it's kinda tricky -
Can't forget that I'm mothafuckin' chickenshit
To the ones who tries to play the E -
By the time you reach Seven you'll be 6 feet deep
Number eight -
Make no mistake
Move real sneaky and you're bound to catch your prey
Ninth one -
I gotta be raw, fuck any brain once your man made law
Last but not least, I must be real -
Number ten - is my appetite to ki ...[Intro]
Is America like ancient Rome?
Is America like ancient Babylon?

[Verse 1]
I told you Ren will be back with the niggas in the Dodge and the camouflage
Blunted at the Taj, a million niggas no mirage
Creeping and we're creeping in your little white huts
20 million niggas chanting I don't give a fuck
It's on, the switch got flicked but who did it?
When that shit was committed, fuck that was my mack
Niggas getting crazy cause Ren is in the front
With Supreme Wisdom, puffing on a blunt
Train by my side tearing up shit
With his bulletproof vest, still yelling double S
The whole community is up in a rage
Cause niggas be moving closer to white motherfuckers'll make them as slaves
And then they put these sell out niggas on the TV
To try to calm down niggas like you and me
But fuck that shit, cause my eyes are closed
Cause Ren ain't got time to be fucking around with them hoes
So I see ya at the grave where we bury them
Even motherfuckers that went out and even married them
Now it's time to attack take this motherfucker back
Bring it on, and it's on

[Hook]
Attack, attack, attack on Babylon (x8)

[Verse 2]
Here comes the doom, so listen to the tick of the tock
Can't keep niggas off your block, don't forget we got the Glock
And the sawed-off, and the trey 8's
And the duce duce, and the niggas in the pen breaking loose
So Ren will conduct this, but I pull my dick and say suck this
For the niggas that say fuck this
That ain't down, and step foot into the car
To commit the 187 with the nigga they call Akbar
But who gives a fuck who pulled the trigger
Cause I know some bitches that shot up a gang a niggas
Getting off the reservations, breaking up the docks
Doing this with 15 shots
Babylon the Great, look at the bitch while she falls
Dying like a motherfucker with no one to call
Now it's time to attack, take this motherfucker back
You bring it on, and it be on

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Where the fuck ya gonna run
When the fucking ground starts shaking
Niggas don't be waiting, niggas be constantly making
Niggas with no hesitation, a fuck up in this nation
To murder the caucasian, the Asian invasion
So here we come, come, come
My nigga Rhythm D is on the drum, drum, drum
The mayday, oh it's a dreadful day
When no motherfucker can come out to play
It goes (5 gunshots)
Niggas letting off and the shit is all that
So stay inside the house if you ain't down
Cause you might get caught up you sad faced clown
Then I'll bring ya to ya knees, fucking with these
Fucking with niggas that's a hive a bees
We go stinging, but dumbass niggas keep singing
No time for singing, too busy swinging
So it's time to attack, take this motherfucker back
Y'all brought it on, so now it's on

[Hook][Intro: MC Ren]
Ah yeah, we gonna get busy one time
For the motherfuckin bitches out there in Compton
To this slow, slow, slow ass beat
We got my man Chip in the house
My man Young D, my man Donovan
And I am the incredible MC Ren
And my man Lil Nation's gonna do it somethin like this

[Verse 1: CPO Boss Hogg]
This is the ballad of a menace
Not to be confused with that of a grimace
I'm in this to be number one, when I step upon
And walk the streets, stalk the meat, like that of a predator
Blow the brains out the head of my competitors
I'm a product of your sins, though you say I never heard of ya
A killer, dope dealer, gangsta murderer
Merciless maniac, monical manipulation
Primary focus of your local police station
I roll cold in my 'llac
Pumpin sounds that are great, doin a jack move
As I groove, the gangsta melody
Heads are cracked to a nine year old
And I've been told pimpin hoes is a felony
But I'm not a doctor or lawyer I wasn't made to be
Ever Luciferic because I get paid to be
There ain't no rehabilitatin, pull a gat on your grandmother
Then take her social security
The boundary lines of my jurisdiction expands
From day to day, ruler of all I survey
And with that, load up my gat then I pack
So I can buzz on the suckers that you replenish
This is the ballad of a menace

[Hook]
"I'm a menace to society"

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
This is a ballad of a menace
Ren will finish and diminish
All the suckers that thought they could flow like me that was in this
Society wishes for my death, or my downfall
But they're playin theyself, as if they playin some roundball
Cause I'm terrorizin, the territory I'm steppin on
Endangerin citizens while I'm keepin my weapon on
My hip like a psycho, cause to me it's hospitable
I just got word, the Ruthless Villain was critical
Let's get it straight, the ones that want some can come with that
Illiterate motherfuckers I make you look dumb with that
Stumble and fumble cause I'mma crush til you crumble
So you can stutter and stutter but keep it down to a mumble
MC Ren is never taken as the sucker
In other words, I'm a bad motherfucker!
So next time I walk your streets you should know
To lock your doors, and close your windows
And if you was thinkin that protection could stop me
It takes a continent full of niggas to drop me
And for me to be vicious yo it's valid
While I'm conductin and producin
A ballad of a motherfuckin menace

[Hook]

[Verse 3: CPO Boss Hogg]
I carry my balls just like a gauge
Nobody's safe when I'm enraged
Sacrifice the suckers and weak motherfuckers
That run in fear, I'm the menace to misery
Answer the knock at your door and open the AK delivery
Best known for bein unsympathetic when I pick em
Cause sympathy is for the pathetic and to the victim
Smoke one and smoke another mercy is my only incapacity
Yo cause I'm a hard brotha
Maniacal madman, son of Mephisto
Fine to go to Hell, since I was an embryo
A criminal, standin in a gangsta pose
Steppin with Ren the Villain slappin up all the hoes
Your mother your sister your daughter your wife
And if you was reincarnated I would snatch your second life
In it for the money, down for me myself and I
You see, and fuck the community
I know in conclusion that death is my destiny
But fuck it, be shootin motherfuckers that's left to me
So write my malevolent epitath, put it in the book of Guiness
And title it, The Ballad of a Menace

Lookin' for nut, wantin' the Ville's dick
Two bad bitches, the Black and Filipino shit
We sit, these whores just in love with the dick
Ren got that shit, they love to fuck with
All night sentence, open your mouth
Open your blouse, let my black ass gets you arouse
You want the Villain up in here lickin' your nipple
Sip some rippals, smoke some bud, warm the hot tub
I'm the motherfuckin' shit around here
Bangin' these whores every year

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 3: MC Ren]
If you ain't fuckin, you best believe
Look at all these whores we're about to receive
We got them laid on the coach, playin' with their clits
Puffin' on the weed and talkin' big shit
How many dicks can she take in her ass?
Especially when she know, she likes it hard and fast
Put your hands together, for the dick sucker
Ren gon' pimp her, y'all gon' fuck her
Make that bitch starts to come a lot
Keep the trick hot, make the bed rot
Nut tight like fork knocks, the pussy is loose
Make the whore twists her legs like the noose
We're all good now, lookin' to the camera smile
You gonna be suckin' dick for a while
That's how it's goin' down
When you're fuckin' with Villain straight from Compton
Bangin' these whores

[Hook] (x2)

[Outro: DJ Yella]
Yeah, this is how we do it
For the O three, Play Boy.T -] "Yella's Cousin"
MC Ren, awww yeah, big man
And WEEE, you're still my nigga, ha ha ha
Ugh, takin' this shit over
Ugh, for the real niggas
Smoke it up, light it up
Ugh, I'm out[Verse 1]
Now this is a bitch who makes straight A's
But never got to leave out of the house back in the days
And when she was at school, she gave people dirty looks
She always carried books and thought me and my friends were crooks
You always see the bitch in the classes
She never wore pants, she wore a dress and some glasses
Teachers used to brag, she was the teacher's pet
Every nigga used to brag how much they wanna make her wet
Straight to her butt, cause she ain't tall
But you would say fuck her when you saw the bitch walk
Ass hanging out by the pound
And that's the reason why niggas wanted to get her panties down
She kept to herself in the hallways
And never looked at niggas like all day
And when the last bell rang she was gone
So one day I decided to follow the bitch home
Her mother was at work she wouldn't get home until six
So it was time for Ren to put the bitch in the mix
Cause back in the school it was every niggas dream
So now it's time to get a closer look behind the scene

[Verse 2]
Now I made it to her house but she wouldn't let me in though
So I said fuck it, smack around to the window
She get into the room and start to undress
Now I'm biting on my lips saying, "Damn this bitch is blessed"
The doorbell rang, it was the nextdoor neighbor
And he was axing up, could she do him a favor
She grabbed the nigga's hand and took him in the room
And layed on the back as he fucked her with a broom
She said she wanted back up so then she said
She wanted him to eat the pussy so she grabbed his head
And he started eating it like a thanksgiving dinner
He made the bitch cum and then he put his dick up in her
She scratched up his back with her claws
But she was screaming so loud he had to gag her with his drawers
But after they finish fucking yo the bitch took a shower
To wash off the sweat from the last half hour
The bitch put out some bud and then she started to smoke
Took his wicked jack daddy and made a few miles of coke
This innocent shit gotta go
Because this innocent little girl is a ho
Yo behind the scenes

[Verse 3]
Now I went back to school the very next day
And I knew that my niggas won't believe what I had to say
I told them what I saw and niggas said, "Yeah right"
So I told the mothafuckas to come over there tonight
Now there's ten real niggas at her window
Waiting to see a ho like at a matinee show
They thought that I was lying cause we waited one hour
And when we started to leave the bitch walked out the shower
Ass on the round the bitch do it in her bed
Her bottomlips was hanging and she started fingerbanging
Her daddy walked in and started beating her with a belt
The bitch was so hot she made the leather start to melt
But she was liking it, yelling: "Daddy give it to me harder"
Then he took off all his cloth and start fucking his doughter
My niggas outside did'nt believe what they would see-some
But when her mama got home, they turned into a threesome
Her mama ate the pussy while her daddy doggy styled it
The family prayed together and they also laid together
I couldn't take no more cause I was too much of a man
So I jumped right through the window with my dick in my hand
The dad and the mom kept doing what they were doing
Cause now it was even it was two against two
But a couple minutes after I was in
All my niggas jumped in all ten
Yo behind the scenes!

"..this was a bitch that did the whole crew.."[Intro]
1995 and Compton's still up in this motherfucker
Yeah, this album's dedicated to all you real niggas
But most of all it's dedicated to you bitch ass niggas

[Verse 1]
Who is it? The bitch made nigga killa
I'm swingin' on niggas ever time I feel 'em
Cause niggas walkin' 'round with their ass out
So I'll be droppin' funky shit till they pass out
These bitch made niggas swingin' on the dick
Back the fuck up before I have a fit
I'm peelin' niggas caps, makin' gang of snaps
Be true to this shit with hard motherfuckin' raps
187 bitch slappin' on the track
Makin' fools break theyself like as if it was a jack
Keep a big stick just incase I gotta swing
The heater is the mack, stashed at the shack
So while your rollin Danas in your force mobile
Just remember motherfuckers the shit caps I peel
Niggas just a piece of cheese for a hood rat
Falsin' for a hooker and I never understood that
Cause it's the same old shit everyday and every night
Cause nigga Ren won't put it down if the shit ain't tight
So listen to the funk as I deal a
Blow to a bitch made nigga, I'm the bitch made nigga killa

[Hook] (x2)
You know the color, the villain is in black
Bitch made niggas better watch they backs, hooker
You know the color, the villain is in black
Beatin' niggas down and it's like that, fool

[Verse 2]
And I'm stalkin', walkin' in my khaki suit
Tryin' to see what niggas I'm a have to shoot
This ain't a bang-bang boogie like the new booty flow
New niggas tryin' to do the shit I did years ago
Cause if it ain't rough it ain't E-motherfuckin' nuff
You bitch made niggas, here to call your bluff
Pull your ho card, like my nigga Kam said
Crack my big stick up against your damn head
Yeah, radio suckas never play me
But you can hear bitch made niggas on daily
Ren gonna have to put his foot down
Motherfuckers ain't gonna like how it's put down
So mic check one, whatever I don't give a damn
Me be ready to slam, when I hit the jam
So yell controversy when I bust the rhyme
No more irresistible bitch made niggas in '99
Black reign is coming, niggas it's bad weather
Whenever 187 and Ren get together
And listen to the funk as I deal a
Blow to these bitch made niggas, I'm the bitch made nigga killa

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Hypocrite niggas always runnin' they mouth
From the north, to the east, to the west, and south
Cause the freaks come out at night
And all bitch made niggas be comin' cause they don't have no friends
So don't come around playin' double-O 7
Cause your ass might get caught in a two-eleven
Niggas don't call me 'less the video is poppin'
Only come around when my new shit's droppin'
Niggas ain't nothin' but some hound dogs I betcha
You bitch made niggas didn't know that I was the bitch catcher
I'll choke ya with a grip
Stranglin' motherfuckers not comin correct, so don't slip
Real niggas don't die, so I'm still alive
Fuckin' up shit in '94 and '95
Cause I'm livin' like a hustler
Busta, heard you was talkin' that shit so ya musta
Thought it wouldn't get back to me
Niggas ya shoulda thought a million times before you tried to do me
But listen to this funk as I deal a
Blow to you bitch made niggas, I'm the bitch made nigga killa

[Outro]
You know the color, the villain's in black[Intro: MC Ren]
Right about now, you're witnessin' the sounds
Of MC motherfuckin' Ren and motherfuckin' Bigg Rocc

[Verse 1: MC Ren]
I be peepin' you niggas tellin' your bitch not to smile at the villain
She wants this dick, I must to quit
Tell you motherfuckers like Johnny Cochran you ain't shit
You'se a studio and still don't fit
I been lookin' at niggas cheesin' and grinnin'
On MTV, BET, no more cheese
So I call my nigga Rocc and get the shit done
Fuck the police, we blase in the sun
Make your bitch come, these hoes they all dumb
Wake up the next morning they'll blame it on the run
But Villain gone bring
Some ghetto ass shit, don't need the nigga to sing
Have your own mamma gyratin' on my ding-a-ling
You know how I do it, she swallowed it
Rip right through it, so next time you open your mouth
Make sure my motherfuckin' dick sway the fuck out

[Hook: Bigg Rocc] (x2)
I hear niggas talkin' shit like bringin'
Well I'mma bring it, if you niggas gon' sing it tonight
We gon' party, get high all night
Get drunk, fuck hoes all through the night, ha

[Verse 2: Bigg Rocc]
I hear niggas talkin' shit like bringin'
Well I'mma bring it if you niggas gon' sing it
Then I'mma close your curtains, this is my show
Up rises the .44, blast at your door
Criminal minded, you have been blinded
West Coast, Compton, niggas we stay grinded
We hardheads, feds, most wanted killers
They came with a bare, tryin' to figure out niggas
The blocks with guns, the guns with tote
The bomb ass bitches, the chronic and coke
It's a bunch of rich ghetto negros
Check out the gators on my motherfuckin' toes
Keep a lot for pocket, throw gangster party
Don't invite the niggas you hated, they'll overrated
Ugh, I'mma keep a fuckin' bullet for the wasters
Now we keep it cheap for my motherfuckin' gangsters

[Hook: Bigg Rocc] (x2)

[Verse 3: Bigg Rocc]
It's a chosen world nigga don't get mad
Cause your bitch wanna hop her ass, in my the back of my 'llac
And take her ride down memory lane, of that chronic and hypnotic
Body lookin' so exotic
I gotta watch it before I hit it
Sure up on all that pussy, puttin' on the show like a classic ho
On the '91 headed west bound to the Penthouse
So I can beat that fat pussy down

[Verse 4: MC Ren]
Yeah, one more time, we bout to rock this shit
Bigg Rocc and 'Ren hittin' tailspins
Would you think about that, you bitch
When your baby mamma suckin' my dick
I'm too sick with it
Compton finest, bitches behind us, what the fuck you're sayin'
We have your mamma frayin'
So bring it on, fuck the microphone
Just give me like two zones
My black ass is gone, nigga

[Hook: Bigg Rocc] (x2)[Intro]
Welcome to America

[Dr. Khalid Muhammad]
Good evening, this is the truth hour
And don't you touch that dial
Just stay tuned in, to the truth hour
I didn't come to lighten up, I came to tighten up

[Verse 1: MC Ren]
Niggas, here I come, black nigga, the guerrilla
Busting shit, who is it? - it's the Bitch Made Nigga Killa
I control the streets, shit is all underground
Niggas gotta step the fuck back, when I come around
Nigga, fuck the police, the white one, the black one
The Mexican, the Japanese can all suck deez
Cause how in the fuck can you serve this government?
That be plotting to kill niggas, they want to steal niggas
Here we are today, 30, 40 million strong
Handkerchief-headed niggas saying ain't shit wrong
Niggas don't give a fuck about your three strikes
That's why I give you hell when I'm busting on the mic
I got niggas in the cut of the ninety-one
Niggas in the streets selling heaters, I'mma find me one
And off them devils off from the shack
Fools going crazy cause that nigga Ren is back

[Verse 2: Cold 187um]
What's up, dog? - it's on once again, let them fools know
When we're coming through, we're straight giving you the voo doo
Keep it real, if you like it or you don't
Working hard like bugs, straight have know what the fuck we want
I bought a house in the suburbs
Next to the homie Wade, I made a killing off them birds
White folks straight mad as fuck
Because I'm rolling in a Benz and a 30 thousand Dollar truck
Yo, I takes mine, yo, when I shakes mine
On the real, the government labels me a flatline
And Uncle Sam gives a fuck about me
That's why I'm spitting in this phase on the Ren LP
Yo, he more wicked then a horror flick
Think you won't, high powered mandate to a five dollar bitch
Yo, they say America the land of the free
But the first thing I have seen was slavery, fool

[Hook]
So is you scared of me?
Four hundred and thirty nine years of slavery (Slavery)
And we still ain't free
But we supposed to act like we're living in harmony
(Bring it on, you've got to bring it on)

[Verse 3: Triggerman]
I pledge allegi' to the flag
When I'm rolling down the block in my ride
But it's.. it's your rag
Yeah, I stick hand tight
I drop a kite to my nigga in the Pen' doing ten
I put a nigga in a cage, but I'm never on his back
While Uncle Sam straight stack
I wish they let them fly like the pigeon in the wind
But every nigga in the Pen' alive
With one point to get every three sixty five
Say you gotta keep up, if you're on the main line
You gotta hurt some, while you're in the chow-line
So if you wanna survive don't let them eyes sleep
Even when you hustle on the streets

[Verse 4: KM.G]
Yeah, break myself never
However, I'm in this so scrilla
The Clinic gang running thangs up, so I smell trouble
Gathering up at the shack, cause Ren's got my back
187's got a sack, and I got a sack
So bring it on, we get the whole country high
Above the Law, the crooked letter, a year supply
Then they get upset, cause we set up shop, in their hoods
And start slanging them no goods
We should go uptown, and poison the suburbs
Have all them white fellows straight going to the curb
Instead they slide down to our block
(Just to get a bit of that Peruvian rock)
Ain't no gun factories in Gardena
Ain't no poppy fields popping out in Pomona
I bought my steel from a white man
My works from the S-A-M
My interiors be looking hitting corners, Huh

[Hook]

[Outro: Dr. Khalid Muhammad]
You with me?
Cause I got to drop this stuff tonight
Because I'm a truth terrorist
I'm a knowledge gangster
I'm a black history hitman
I'm a lie killer, urban guerrilla
I gotta be a roughneck
I gotta be a roughneck
It's the only way I know to go[Intro]
"Man, wackass radio stations man play the same shit over and over and over, wackass shit. Stupid ass dumb ass shit. When you got shit like my shit, som real shit, you want them to play that shit, these fakeass niggas want you to pay. Fuck y'all niggas
I'ma do it like this"

[Verse 1: MC Ren]
People be looking at the villain
Damn this nigga be killing
Get at my nigga for tracks
Ski already got my back
Me and E-A from Cali to VA
Big up to Kay-Slay fuck these other DJs
Scared to play the villain, scared to rebail
Scared to go against the grain, go and tuck your tail
Radio DJ's don't give your niggas these replays
They be giving these wack fools back to back for plenty of days
It's plenty of ways to call these niggas out
Fake wannabe celebrities no doubt
I'm with Tech and Sway, I'm wake-up showin
Why these DJs on the air keep hoein'
I'ma call them out if they don't play this
Villain been waiting to say this, not feeling your playlist
One more line for the hook to come in
Y'all know this shit is bumping, villain be lyrically dumping

[Hook: Redd Tha Rsonist]
DJ's don't wanne play my shit
Do I make you afraid by the way I spit?
Killing the game for fame start raising the standard
Man I swear these bitch niggas are cancer
Burn the radio down I'ma make them suffer
Burn the radio down cause they running from us
Burn the radio down better run for cover
We don't wan't our music watered down in this mothafucka

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
I'm giving it up to all the rebels that gone bump this
Wack niggas in the game can't trump this
Radio station looking for that pay out
When they burn your shit down find a way out
This is hip hop, but y'all killing the culture
Filling the belly of vultures, trying to get rid of the soldiers
Bumping this crack babies daily, making the villain crazy
Record sounding lazy, programmers shady
Whatever happened to them 15-80 days
If your shit was dope, that was getting played
When you can make something tight, didn't have to bite
Didn't have to fight to get your record played at night
Didn't have to kiss ass or do free shows
Or they drive your record out like free repose
But today I see it's all about the zeroes
They want these sellout niggas for your heroes

[Hook: Redd Tha Rsonist]

[Verse 3: MC Ren]
You can find the homie Ren on the internet
That's where they play me, they ain't gotta pay me
I ain't bout to kiss ass just to get played
The old G's wanna hear a nigga anyway
When you niggas say it's that rebel music
Throw your shit in the air, we about to lose it
We about to go berzerk on these new fools
That wanna jump up in the game, but don't know the rules
They make a whole lot of noise, but they ain't saying nothing
Got to concentrate hard when they play you something
But I ain't tryna hate, it ain't all of them
But the ones tight people drop the ball on them
Giving it up to everybody writing for a purpose
Keeping the realness alive, fighting to survive
But like I said it's all about the zero's
They want these wackass niggas for your hero's

[Hook: Redd Tha Rsonist][911 dispatch] 911, what are you reporting
[Woman] hello 911, help me, help me
[911 dispatch] what is your emergency

And pimping hoes and smoking a million blunts a day
Shooting a hundred niggas and saying he walked away without a scratch

[MC Ren]
I'm a Ruthless gangster, definition Villain
Leave your shit unlocked and he's stealin'
So call the police cause that's all you could do "but what?"
He'll get away without leavin' a clue "yeah"
Keepin' shit in control like the neighboorhood chief
But, referred to as a walkin' thief
They say he's a bad influence for the kids, home boy

[Dr. Dre] Why the fuck they're blamin' him?
[MC Ren] Cause he's the one that they jock
[Dr. Dre] Cause he's... (*Explosion*)[Verse 1: MC Ren]
I fuck so good I make dike bitches straight
And give em mo love jones then Lorenzo's tape
Nigga outta state been to every nigga hood
Gets treated like Farrakhan, the shit is all good
Niggas be on their knees like their ready to suck a dick beggin'
Like niggas about to beat they ass caught for bootleggin'
The Villain be havin keys to black holes in space
Hoes beggin a nigga to lick my nuts for a taste
Dick be so huge, givin em over bites like Monefa
Be hard to leave the room when she undress that black moon
My shit explodin' more than Timothy McVeigh
Fuck with me I'll take yo ass off the L like K day
Compton niggas fighting more than MGM Grand
Fucking bitches looking like the real Roxanne
Niggas know they can't fuck with me
It's CPT all day howz it gone be niggas?

[Hook] (x2)
Niggas in Compton don't give a mad fuck
Where the fuck you from nigga, what the fuck up?
CPT nigga that's how it gotta be
Call my niggas from the from the hub if you wanna fuck with me

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
I don't be givin a fuck I be making these niggas and bitches pissy
Comin' at me with that bullshit y'all can miss me
A real nigga, you know y'all niggas used to wanna be
Too hard motherfuckers like me and E
Full of freaky tales like Short, got a killa appettite
Yo bitch chose me cause I could fuck her all night
You niggas worse than D'angelo bitin' Prince
Or Heavy D biting Biggy, I'll slap yo ass silly
Real niggas made Will Smith leave Philly not Jada
These bitch niggas turnin into Ren hatas
Cause I still get paid for writing
That street shit that they play that make mothufukkas start fightin
So come on, hop on my nuts like everybody did Greenbay
Still won't believe it like the screenplay
You wack niggas tryin to walk around proud
You muthufukkin groupies ain't allowed

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 3: MC Ren]
I gives a fuck, you niggas mad cause I made your bitch hot
I saw you slap her ass in the parking lot
Compton niggas like me be born macks
Add it to this fuckin nigga if you wore black
Gang shit change, Compton still the shit niggas know
In this rap shit Compton Niggas all pro
That street shit, yall niggas know who made the best
Compton niggas holding down the whole fucking west
Nobody tryin to see yo ass like that movie Booty Call
Mo suave than MJG and 8Ball
Niggas mo bitchy than that nigga Genuwine
The bitches are free, but stupid niggas buy the wine
Compton niggas be takin pussy, on GP
Or they be down to suck yo dick if you MC
But if you ain't the villain hold yo dick in yo hand tell em give me
The bitches strip tease like Demi

[Hook] (x2)

[Outro: MC Ren (T-Girl)]
Bitch niggas that's how it gotta be
(Punk bitches that's how it gotte be)
Bitch niggas that's how it gotta be
Call my niggas from the hub if you wanna fuck with me
(Punk bitches that's how it gotta be)
Bitch niggas that's how it gotta be
(Punk bitches that's how it gotta be
Call my niggas from the hub if you wanna fuck with me)[ VERSE 1: KAM ]
Well, it's the 1 to the 9 with the 9 to the 4
And I thought you knew the drill but you still don't hear me doe
KAM and Watts Up from the grassroots
No Daisy Dukes shit, knockin crazy-ass boots
Nigga please, we kick it like gees
Puttin down work when I lurk, don't even sneeze (up the gold D's)
That's just the Eastside way of gettin chips
When you're raised up dealin with the Dogs and the Ribs
New cars get tagged, riders get wrecked
Niggas' caps get peeled back and chins get checked
Don't expect no love or no apology
The kids ain't fallin for your child psychology
In nine and fo mindin yo business was the best bet
Screamin 'Watts Riot', we ain't even made a mesh yet
You shouldn't speak with a weak heart
You gots to finish everything you start
That's why I'm down for mine

[ Hook ]
(Get down for yours
I'm down for mine)

"?????"
"To get away from the A.K. spray in the broad day"
"South Central the, ill mental"
"Just kept steppin, hit em up and said right"

[ VERSE 2: MC Ren ]
Well, it's the Mad Scientist with my nigga KAM
Niggas be knowin the way I be doin it, fuckin up the jam
The size ten steel toe steppin, nigga, keep my shit simple
Hangin with my niggas on Caldwell and Temple
Niggas out fakin like they got skills
Rollin 'round with they rats in they floss mobiles
With their caviar dreams and champagne wishes
Niggas run they mouth like some muthafuckin bitches
Niggas be plottin like the government
But I'm low key like a Mason, so they still chasin
The nigga that they thought was the Villain, that's wrong
Different individual and different fuckin song
I carry a big stick, burnin is the heater
Niggas ???? with the German millimeter
So I fuck it up when I bust my rhyme
Cause Ren down for mine, a nigga down for mine

[ Hook ]

[ VERSE 3: KAM ]
Well, I once had this homeboy who loved to jack
We used to serve herb for a doub a sack
In fact back in the day when you could sling lley
Couldn't nobody tell me that crime didn't pay
It was on and poppin with the Bloods and Crips
Every neighborhood tryin to regulate they chips
Niggas goin out of town with the greasy chickens
And if you wasn't down, you was easy pickins
You had to claim a set to get supported then
So every day new niggas got courted in
For some gangbangin was a full time job
Cookin up dope like corn on a cob
Had to mob deep when you bailed into a party
Daytons on the MC with the wooden ?????
Flag in your backpocket, deuce five in the front
Rollin bats with the zig-zags 'fore we knew about the blunts
But no matter who jocks us
I got my sag on till you saw the tag on my boxers
Cause the I-don't-give-a-fuck mentality'll raise niggas off yo line
So I'm down for mine

[ Hook ]

[ VERSE 4: Dresta ]
Let me take a second to do some mic-checkin
Bet I got a head flexin in every section
Everybody know me, D-r-e the O.G
Compton City Gee on TV with Eazy
But now I'm all on my own and got it locked shot
Give them props up to my nigga KAM (Watts Up)
It ain't no shame in the game that I got
The only places I love a lot is Compton and Watts
And nigga, I don't give a fuck about what clique you in
Cause I'm from the Nutty but got buddies in the Nickerson
P.J., Main Street, Grape Street, front streets and back streets
But we all from the same black streets
So niggas best to recognize the Dresta
Tired of bein broke so all I think about is paper
And it don't stop to the tic-toc
(Compton and Long Beach together) [edited] Compton and Watts
Fool, and I'm down for mine

(Get down for yours
I'm down for mine)[Verse 1: MC Ren]
This for my nigga Train and my nigga E
Niggas way back from the CPT
This for all the homies that passed away
Wishing they we’re all here so the could see the day
See the kids play, se them graduate
Bring them up right, make sure they act straight
It’s a cold world and time is short
Got me stressing homie puffing on the new porch
Shit is fucked when a homie gotta go
Knowing you ain’t gonna hear is voice no more
Keep your eyes up nigga don’t look down
Ain’t no motherfucking thing to see on the ground
So keep looking up, gotta be a better way
Give a fuck about what the fake preachers gotta say
Street is cold, don’t give a fuck
You fuck around and your ass is stuck

[Hook: MC Ren]
What the fuck is the world coming to?
New World Order jumps the borders
From California to Florida, coast to coast
They wanna keep black and brown down the most
Don’t think that this shit was a plan
Feed you bullshit so you can’t understand
Try to organize and pull it together
So when these fools creep we be down for whatever

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
Why this shit gotta be this way?
Babies getting killed everyday by straight
Bullets is hot, system cold
Lucky if your ass ever see twenty years old
Kids deposed, sleeps on the floor
Motherfuckers acting like they don’t see
From (?) to executive suites
People on the street never got nothing to eat
They got their hands out, your's in the pocket
Coming up to your door, your ass locked it
Fuck balling out the banks fucking snakes
Fuck the government got them pumping their breaks
Give us fucked up education and shitty jobs
Fucked up housing, why the blowing thousand
I’m the villain nigga telling the truth
That’s the only way I know while I’m up in the booth

[Hook: MC Ren]

[Verse 3: MC Ren]
Bring your ass in, homie Ren on one
Got this shit moving, got that fine bitch grooving
Got the police rocking back and forth with it
A lot of motherfuckers just ain’t home get it
This for the hood up in every state
From the Empire State to the Golden Gate
To the UK all the way to burg
This westcoast shit is the hardest shit you ever heard
Gangsta party music, go ride to it
Police fuck shit, say you had to do it
This Villain Nation, nigga be pation
All you fools now hating, quit hating
Y’all fucks with it, when the jail get it
Bitch-ass niggas don’t admit it
Quit playing hard, stop mugging
Fake-ass thuging, you we’re born with nothing

[Hook: MC Ren] (x2)
