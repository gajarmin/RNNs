[Verse 1: Planetary]
Battling Plan's a bad plan
I'm raw like cats from Afghanistan with gats in their hands
From Philly to Pakistan 'space packin the stands
You make all fake thugs start acting like Stans
You'll never make your move cuz you lackin the fans
I been illin' since I had a backpack full a cans
You see life pass by you in the blink of an eye
Thinkin you fly, we'll choke you in the sink till you die
You spit lava rap, so holla back if need be
You'll burn if you step, believe me, come see me
I'll make you see moons in the break of day
And make sure that your body slowly starts to decay
It's gruesome, I had to add my two cents
The next movement in rap guess who's sent
Outerpsace nigga, and we demand we eat
And if not we gonna leave a bloodbath in the street nigga

[Interlude: Vinnie Paz]
They asked me, concerning the spoils of war
Such spoils are the disposal of God and the apostles
So fear God, and keep straight the relations between yourselves
Obey God and his apostles if ye do believe
I'm so confused, take the world away

[Verse 2: Crypt the Warchild]
I'm a maniac, you need to watch who you war with
You in the land of stars when the block is enormous
Squash rocks with my hands, my palms is enormous
Flow the hot lava that I drop when I scorch it
Droppin candy rappers that get chopped up and snorted
Newborn kids they get chopped up, aborted
Planet warchild, when we pop up report it
Committin riot acts so we constantly torch it
Illest Puerto-Rock this whole process is morbid
Equipped with slaughter blocks, you get the picture-a portrait
If it ain't monetary, what's your reason for touring
All that shit you pop, to be honest it's boring
Been rockin the mic since before inter-corporate
You need to sit back and let your conscience absorb this
Before you ship that demo to them dudes in the office
Come test your skills for real in hell's fortress

[Interlude: Vinnie Paz]
I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth
Holding the four winds of the earth, so that no wind would blow on the earth
Or on the sea, or on any tree
I saw another angel ascend from the sunrise
Having the seal of the living god
He cried with a loud voice to the four angels
I'm so confused
To whom it was given to harm the earth and the sea

[Verse 3: Immortal Technique]
Immortal Technique, I live life strangling death
I walk through the land where the fallen angel is kept
But I will never bow down to a Pagan habit
Like Roman gods that were faggots named after the planets
The connotations of Revelation taken for granted
Mark of the beast, government microchips implanted
I'll be branded a maniac for speaking the truth
And I'll be murdered as soon as I hit the street with the proof
Illuminati trying to raise the devil at any cost
They probably cloned Jesus with the blood off of the cross
And I know that it's the same mother fuckers I see
That genetically engineered HIV
Controlling the population according to mathematics
Generated by Masons and the military industry
Sponsoring terror, creatin the profit margin that'll last forever
The crusades and Vietnam sand-blasted together
And you believe in "whatever", even a Federal promise
But the spawn of Shaytan could never be honest
And poor people pay homage and pray to a god
That the Vatican themselves don't really believe in
Cuz they'd rather worship money and the physical demons
Without biblical reason I execute em for treason
I don't need an alibi, cuz my place in history is the book of Malachi
Motherfucker

[Outro]
Immortal Technique; Harlem, New York and North Philly
The Angels of Death are here you motherfucker
We'll turn your cities to salt, nigga
Y'all ain't shit, and none of your peoples are shit
None of your children are shit
You'll all be dead tomorrow, you fake motherfuckers
What!?[Verse One: King Magnetic]
It's the King, The Cauze, the bing, the bars
The skin, the scars, the limbs, the gauze
Next known body that, X hold shotty cat
Roger that, lodging that right inside your Dodger cap
The odds of that, more that that, margin gap
The artists that they marvel at
A starving cat, involving gat, evolve from that
I brawl for that, off of that
Medicine, the veterans is gettin' slim
The evidence, my presence is unprecedented
I'm reminiscing of a demolition
Over premonition of a dead division
Many risen, many prisons overcrowded
The powers won't allow it
Get devoured by the sour when the powels in the bowels
Them hours that them cowards is hidin' from
Colliding one, size my gun
If I was you, I would run
Leaving either lung
Reach inside my trunk
And leave Philly with my team like I'm Iverson

[Reef the Lost Cauze talking]
I go by Reef The Lost Cauze. Mmmhuuhahahah

[Verse Two: Reef The Lost Cauze]
Yo, who the fuck you think you talkin' to
I'll fuckin' destroy all of you
The Cauze, you dudes running into walls that I'm walkin' through
They see my face in the game, they call audibles
Offing you, junkyard dogs, Sargent Slaughter you
Before you open your trap, here's what you outta do
Fuck you pay me, need cash before I talk to you
I need cash, to cop me another Glock
The industry make me sick, the industry can suck my cock
I don't need none of you, consider me a favor
I don't need none of you, consider me a hater
You don't know me, consider me a stranger
Independent for life, they consider me a major
Never a star gazer, I am so space
Show up to your showcase, leave you with a broke face
Holding pipes, run up on your open mic
And you'll never be shit except unimpressive and over hyped

[Scratch Hook]

[Verse Three: Crypt The Warchild]
We contract killers, sign the line there's no clause
In the City Of God we obey no laws
We renegade, we razor blade with steady aim
Heavy rain of kerosene makin' deadly flames
Hood paradise, slum merchant with his gun squirtin'
We can't live in peace cause we the only ones hurtin'
Keep my mind in space but leak Pharaoh blood
Keep my words engraved on a hollow slug

[Planetary]
It's the Army, and what that means is
I'm worldwide and my goals and dreams is big
I'm sittin' on top of stars, the moon and the sun
When I rap, I'm backed by some goons with guns
I crack jaws like Marciano with brass knuckles
It's real life my nigga, we way past the hustle
We linked up with The Returners now the heads is turnin'
And how the fuck did y'all sleep when the beds are burnin'?

[Scratch Hook]

"Put my Glock away I got a weapon that never runs out of ammunition so I'm ready for war" - Outkast 'ATLiens'[Intro Sample]
1979, all the fathers of nobel prize winners
Were rounded up by United Nations military units alright?
And actually forced at gunpoint
To give semen samples in little plastic jars
Which are now stored, below Rockefeller Center
Underneath the ice skating rink
Wouldn't wanna be there for the thaw (laughter)
Eurgh! I mean it's disgusting..

[Hook]
It's on now. We sit up in outerspace and throw bombs down
You all hype up in our face: nigga, calm down
You don't really want beef. Planet, Warchild
Your whole squad fall down

[Verse 1: Crypt, the Warchild]
I ski down from the stratos, splatter and capture the crowd
This hip hop shit, me and Planet mastered the style
Every rhyme I spit is just to pay dues
While you suffer from third degree burns, when you make moves
Unable to quake, I shake the syndrome out the children
Nose blows got you feeling stiff cold you freezing
Heavily breathing, shook in the Garden of Eden
You face Christ and pay the price, other that you bleeding
You owe ya' life, plus ya' mind, soul and body
I send caution through wind to stop the mind of Socrates
Bring on Plato, philosophies twist tornadoes
My eyes a spectrum after the rain, producing rainbows
Purposefully aim those, 16 until ya' brain close
I expose flows cold, ya' frames remain froze

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Planetary]
I was born to intensify your brain with skill
My name is ill, P that's for the Pain you feel
LA, for the Lyrics that I Aim to kill
NE, Niggers know I Entertain to fill
Train to build, Train to steal the mics from you
I might stun you, watch ya back in a bright tunnel
We spaced out, in the game for the same clout
Those who claim players, games get reigned out
Roll the talk, you've been rejected like Rosa Parks
Get torn apart, QD niggers got colder hearts
Your soul departs, here's where the explosion starts
Shit is hot, city blocks getting blown apart
We throwing darts, contaminated with fire
While my soldiers march, we blasting at ya attire
Sharp like barbed wire, missiles 'll scar liars
Decapitating ya frame and leaving ya jaw wired

[Hook x2][Speaking: Crypt the Warchild]
Once again, Vinnie P. OS. Louis Dogs. Yeah, my nigga Stoupe

[Verse 1: Crypt the Warchild]
I put work in this game now I'm hurtin this game
Put a skirt on your dame, I'm a squirt up her frame
I'm a worsen the pain with a verse that's insane
I'm a evil seed so the curse still remains
Sip the henney fuck the rock, tricked Jenny from the block
With my dogs every day it's good and plenty on the block
Hittin heavy when we rock, aimin steady for the shot
We spaghetti up ya knot if you ain't ready call the cops
Guerilla warfare when we duct tape civilians
If the money's hard to earn then we must take they children
Take a shot in the air let ya gun scrape the ceiling
You can ask T dub how we lust hateful feelings
Don't pass mean mugs if you love to wake for livin
We some classy thugs with a grudge to make millions
We will smash ya mug, won't budge it take millions
On some band and brother shit with size we quake?

[Hook:]
I wanna rock (come on)
Roll (come on)
Ya'll wanna set it on the block (come on)
Rock (come on)
Roll (come on)
Come one, come on
The End is near, you can taste the ground
We can smell your fear, as the army puts you down

[Verse 2: Planetary]
I got two sons a wife and a whip
And I'll never fuck ya chick that's a trifling bitch
I rock New era fitted's and Timbs
And bring ya whole crew terror every time the record spins
Who wanna battle? I'm like an animal in the jungle
Double shots of henney humble still makin crew's crumble
Let's get it in, you fraudulent cats are still bitchin
You hate, I bang Jedi and eluded in one sittin
We from space to sun shape after one take
And I'm 100% and that was one of Puns greats
Too much you sweatin and bettin ya life one me
I'm trife homie, even worst with a knife on me, quite raunchy
Heavy weighters, that make it high for heavy papers
If it come hot, if not then fuck it... I ain't petty hater
Nigga we major, manufacture the wins often
You feel the breeze when I rap think it's the wind talking

[Hook:]
I wanna rock (come on)
Roll (come on)
Ya'll wanna set it on the block (come on)
Rock (come on)
Roll (come on)
Come one, come on
Test me once, I'll take you out
You'll see the truth as the Pharaohs put you down

[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]
Snake charmer, equal opportunity hate monger
I hold the weight in my straight left like H. Harver
Vinnie chop ya fuckin head cause his blade sharper
And every rhyme I fuckin spit is a grenade launcher
I'm an insane author, a nonhuman
Who studied the? test from John von Neumann
Something happens in my brain when the guitar strum
Bitin me would be insane cause it scars lungs
These all guns, and I can handle em
You mean as much to me as uncle Sam and them
So I choose not to abuse telepathy
Cause it's dangerous like the Soviets weaponry
Let's see whos next to me, burn at the fuckin stake
Then I can throw the faggot urn in the fuckin lake
Give me a fuckin break you know what this is
Pazienza, outerspace cousin metaphysics

[Hook:]
I wanna rock (come on)
Roll (come on)
Ya'll wanna set it on the block (come on)
Rock (come on)
Roll (come on)
Come one, come on
Test me once, I'll take you out
You'll see the truth as the Pharaohs put you down
The end is near, you can taste the ground
We can smell your fear as the Army put you down[Intro]
Let's go!
Space Pyscho Realm shit
I know ya'll hating!

[Hook x2 - Abidiel]
Soy un boxeador de la calle, tira y no falles
Puede ser que mi veneno te desmaye
Lo de vivir en la calle es el detalle para hacerlo como yo
Para hacerlo como yo será mejor que ensayes

[Planetary]
Yo, I called Sick Jacken and told that nigga I'm sick of rapping
He told me to find all the hatahs plan and get the clapping
I'm sick of yapping I told Cynic let's get the mashing
We on the flight to LA squeaking in the ratchets
Security on me like its 9/11, you betta find the Reverend
Call your fam up and try to find a blessing
No time for stressing only maculate versions
You niggas bitching put your tampons back in your purses
Shit, if Psycho betta buck down we matching the wages
We collide wit the unit and put it back in your faces
Nigga, back to the basics, I'm lacing my Chuck Taylors
Who proposed to the game, now I'm getting my tux tailored
I treat every stage like the Garden of Eden
I'm the serpent in the trees that'll stop you from breathing
The vocal, pato loco from Illadel to Acapulco
The local is locked; time to lick a shot to rock the global

[Sick Jacken]
And I read the puto thru my recital it's suicidal
Accu cycle banks so heavy that we ruin idols
And I ain't fucking wit this new arrivals
Man I been leaking off and on since the days of the unit rhinos
You rival the pussy I'm cocky they push me
I'm vynl who said, there ain't no future for minor whino
I wanna leave shit stained in the rap game
So I got a sick as clique wit the wrath of Kane
You know the name Psycho's run it like its nutting mayne
Where the million bald heads looking like fucking gangs
Worldwide symphony killing spree wit a guillotine
The shit is getting sick after clicking up wit the Philly team
My heroin rap keeps stem going back for the trap
I tap a vein, Jacks is the insane brain of the camp
We run shit like when Hussein reigned
It's the art of execution and we shoot you sane

[Hook]

[Duke]
Yeah, you can still catch me out in the streets, blazed up
You know we deep and keep running them up
I try to chill so we put the guns down
But the streets got us by the balls
Shit, it's hard not to gun out
Police keep hunting us down, they after me
Fucking swine, they ain't got nutting to offer me
We pirates in all black, bagged wit big gats
If they want some we can leave 'em rightfully stance
So that's what the fucks up (What's that?)
I keep wilding like I don't travel about the world getting my cocked sucked
I try to cool out, my goons go out, they repping that shit
The SS gun and burn down the house, take ova the place
We here for good, the shit could get scary
Like 2012 we just ain't ready
We all need to learn not sit around ready to die
Fuck that, we gonna replenish the Earth

[Crypt the Warchild]
We spit a venomous verse your head will just burst
From Pekoe to Puerto Rico we protecting our turf
So be easy you're dealing wit Made-men
Who do dirt dolo and lyrically spray gems
Digital mayhem thru the G-5 and monitors
Rhyme writ, hieroglyph you can't follow 'em
Mind spit designed sick, I start marketing
Mic booth set on fire, who let the arson in?
Your man got a froggy feeling you betta talk to 'em
Pipe bomb filled wit glass to leave 'em sparkling
Right psalms build to last watch me inside of them
Vomiting, street crash you faggots modeling
You run way bitch, walk I keep 'em wobbling
That gun play let you talk who keeps you swallowing
Blood mugs filled to the top it don't belong to him
That's why they're raising their arms singing the song wit him

[Hook][Hook]

Nobody gets out alive until the cops arrive
It's a dirty job but somebody gotta do it
I cause more scare than Godzilla
Made the church people on your block wanna move out
Nobody gets out alive until the cops arrive
It's a dirty job but somebody gotta do it
My style is wild like pitbulls trapped in cages
Made the church people on your block wanna move out

[Verse 1: Crypt the Warchild]

Every rhyme I write is 25 to Life
Every rhyme you write don't even deserve a mic
Crossing international borders with a bomb threat
You motherfuckers haven't even left your block yet
You're a bitch, you're a ho, here's a prom dress
You wanna try to box with God it's no contest
So keep on thinking this shit is sweet
I'mma start a sandstorm and put you under the Middle East
You got it fucked up homie, I've been a beast
Reptilian tongue and my skin is deep
Rumor has it they say I'm thrown off
Until their limbs is everywhere, wigs is blown off

[Verse 2: Jus Allah]

Is that the cast of a death mass?
Is that water in a red glass?
Why, I'd thought you'd never ask, it's as legend has
There's a method to the mad, it's direct and fast
Disconnected from the guest it's a second-class
I have left a trail of debt, checks in the mail
Heads or tails, death prevails, never fails
I will never get derailed, that tip is stale
I will never get to hell, that ship has sailed
I'm refined, mastermind after cash and kind
Hand me gunshot pantomime, axe to grind
Pass into the sublime have a laxing time
Have a glass of wine, have your last act of kind

[Verse 3: Planetary]

Everything they say is irrelevant
I'm an element of rap that defines pure elegance
Elevating my residence, bigging them up
I'm in the hood rocking JMT shit in the truck
Not I Against I because I don't sleep on my stomach
I rock Heavy Metal Kings and watch the barrel of the gun twitch
You're talking dumb shit, hooting and hollering
I lift the cannon and wait for the bazooka to swallow them
I'mma do this regardless of them, I'm the original
Dirty rotten scoundrel surrounding your pinnacle
Block the perimeter, I'll hit you with the fadeaway
Got a bullet with your name on it for a rainy day

[Verse 4: Doap Nixon]

So many days, so many nights
So much money got fucked up, so many fights
So many niggas got knuckled down for no reason
So many cowards got guns but don't squeeze them
Yeah, that's just the way it is
I finally got a whiz that's ready to bless the sun with a hundred kids
So I can fall back, Ralph Lauren straw hat
Sour Diesel already showed you I'm all that
I won't stop trying to ride on you assholes
First week sales donated to Daschel
You think I'm bugging right?
But it's these zeros in my bank account
That got me saying "Nigga, floss it right"

[Verse 5: Vinnie Paz]

My brain's vast as the sky is
My heart doesn't know what die is
Pyromaniac rap, Vinnie starts fires
Only an ignorant thought ignored Osiris
And that's why the enemy lost and caught virus
Where I'm from Gods, Earths, 85ers
Y'all ain't got heat underneath it's all wires
I'm on some Samhain shit with bonfires
My whole team animal thug and born liars
You ain't aware of what any the 12 Tribes is
You're a devil who tell the enemy where God is

[Outro]

[Hook][Vinnie Paz]
Yeah yeah, the Pazmanian devil
(yeah peoples) Outerspace
(yeah) the fuckin' Warchild
Planetary (yeah, yeah)

[Planetary]
One for the blood, two for the ashes
Three for that new, Outerspace shit classic
Nigga we fantastic, we rhyme masters
I throw lines faster than Mcnab passes (what)
Pass the cup - we start actin' up
I'm a Philly nigga for life, you ain't half as tough
You tried to, shit on the clan only pissed on ya hand
Now that's what the fuck, you get thinkin' you bigger than Fam'
It's Planetary, doggy I can promise I'm vicious
I make ya momma a witness, I vomit on bitches
Rhymes is explicit, real like Haley's comets that visit
Bombs in ya district, similar to Gandhi wit' vision
Explosive shit, and 16s the most you get
You want more you gotta pay, I'm an emotional wreck
The notion of step, is jus' like that moment you slept
You got severed, you should o' never came close to this mess

[Hook]
Y'all can't, we can (singing)
Fall down it's the army - STAND UP!
We came to snatch the crown
And our whole click will (singing)
Fuck around it's the army cocksucker
From Philly to Chi-town
Y'all can't, we can (singing)
Fall down it's the army - STAND UP!
We came to snatch the crown
And our whole click will (singing)
Fuck around it's the AOTP
From Philly to Chi-town

[Crypt the Warchild]
Yo, yo
I came in the game hungry, young buck new jack
Stated my name, and now I abuse raps
Your cranium drained, when I crush ya melon
In the middle of broad day, who the fuck is tellin'?
Outrageous haters, can't contain us
Chickenheads play the side, givin' neck and brain
Ah, rip to shred any track, just by shoutin' phrases
For niggas rockin' backpacks or locked in cages
Whether you clap gats in the blocks, contagious
From rottenest days, boxed in a maze, Lord save us!
Ready for war, with a long machete or sword
Blades of glory will change my story nigga I'm pure
Uncut, bar 16s on triple beams - untouched
The thud alone will cripple fiends
Who want what? - bars explode across the globe
Who jump up? - wit' garbage flows hit the road

[Hook]
Y'all can't, we can (singing)
Fall down it's the army - STAND UP!
We came to snatch the crown
And our whole click will (singing)
Fuck around it's the army cocksuckers
From Philly to Chi-town
Y'all can't, we can (singing)
Fall down it's the army - STAND UP!
We came to snatch the crown
And our whole click will (singing)
Fuck around it's the AOTP
From Philly to Chi-town

[Vinnie Paz]
(Yeah yeah)
Machine gun rap and animal rap, we similar
A bunch of sick fucks like Caligula
Cut you up and spit on ya, carve a Jedi Mind insignia
On ya fuckin' spine, I'm divine rhyme cinema
Put an ice pick in ya, turn into beast
If you fuckin' with my mother brother nephews and niece
The attitude I have on the streets is no peace
That's why I'm always aiming my piece at police
But I don't even want no beef, wit y'all 5-0
That's why I visited four mosques in Cairo
That's why I study the God's thoughts in Heiro'
So I can avoid the cop hot shots that are hollow
The same ones that they put in Amadou Diallo
I'mma start a fucking revolution, y'all follow
The military is disposable - that's hypocrisy
And I'm about to kill ~~~~~ who's stoppin' me?!?[Verse 1: Crypt the Warchild]
Let it be known from the gate yo I ain't cut no coke
Don't let me hear that in your raps or ima cut ya'll throat
Throw your sham in the air while I puff my smoke
Green bottles red sauce till im numb and broke
See these bucks in the street, im the one they quote
And got 'em stuck to this beat from the stuff I wrote
Dedicated to those who let they rusto glow
Lyrics husky on the track and let they muscles show
And if you can't rock a problem its a must ya'll go
When niggas talk a lot of rap but can't conduct no flow
And ya'll could give me any beat and i'll spit regardless
7L scratch it up, till his mitts is claw less
Dont invite us to the lab, if it ain't fit in our list
Cause my dogs spit out sounds till they lips is jaw less
Ya'll in the killer fields when its time for harvest
Step into these vets when ya'll cats is novice
Ya'll never been to war dont even know what Nam is
Until I spit from the trees, and close your coffins

[Hook 1]
Where my niggas on the streets at?
Where the money at? we need that
Where the mics? where the techniques at? we need that
Running underground music we eat that
This year were bringing beef off the meat rack

[Verse 2: Planetary]
Im a menace to microphones murdering your militia
I manufacture move, I creep like Caterpillars
Shattering niggas, Transform into bad gorillas
Lyrics will burn stages ya'll all fags we killers
Space rebel, im above you like eight levels
Bass and treble extinguishes brains and breaks metal
I slay devils, Planetary the Apostle
Known to leave bodies my vocabulary hostile
Mercenary with a third optical lens
Underground street serpent, put a stop to your trend
Blocking your men from making any move
Heavy twos, every jewel Resurrects now my legacy cruise
A loan shark, I lend out cash ya'll bones part
With neon nikes you see me in the zone dark
We own hearts, fight phantoms im like cannons
Im a cannibal spitting a ghetto anthem

[Hook 2]
"151 one sip will make a nigga flip" -Nas
"Must have been puerto rican rum" - Big Pun

[Verse 3: Crypt the Warchild]
Ayo we been bad since the days of LL and Sinbad
Now take a fifth to the chest like McNabb
My clique stabs this body blows and quick jabs
Scorching I Be royal the pot ya'll stiff drabs

[Verse 4: Planetary]
I shift past your whole regime with this trash
Unadulterated it obscene I spit glass
Sick grammar Ya'll be killing your road manager
Flowerful force killing 57 passengers

[Verse 5: Crypt the Warchild]
Dr. Banner incredible Hulk I mistake Bannisters
Whether they spray hammers, or spray paint canisters
Man from the dead and this ain't no Saint Lazarus
Never speaking after this, I hate amateurs

[Verse 6: Planetary]
If you hate Scavengers raw hate im space after this
I will annihilate and blaze you fake activists
Im too treacherous, bruise ya'll crews next to us
Coming for the world

[Hook 1][Verse 1: Planetary]
Battling Plan's a bad plan
I'm raw like cats from Afghanistan with gats in their hands
From Philly to Pakistan 'space packin the stands
You make all fake thugs start acting like Stans
You'll never make your move cuz you lackin the fans
I been illin' since I had a backpack full a cans
You see life pass by you in the blink of an eye
Thinkin you fly, we'll choke you in the sink till you die
You spit lava rap, so holla back if need be
You'll burn if you step, believe me, come see me
I'll make you see moons in the break of day
And make sure that your body slowly starts to decay
It's gruesome, I had to add my two cents
The next movement in rap guess who's sent
Outerpsace nigga, and we demand we eat
And if not we gonna leave a bloodbath in the street nigga

[Interlude: Vinnie Paz]
They asked me, concerning the spoils of war
Such spoils are the disposal of God and the apostles
So fear God, and keep straight the relations between yourselves
Obey God and his apostles if ye do believe
I'm so confused, take the world away

[Verse 2: Crypt the Warchild]
I'm a maniac, you need to watch who you war with
You in the land of stars when the block is enormous
Squash rocks with my hands, my palms is enormous
Flow the hot lava that I drop when I scorch it
Droppin candy rappers that get chopped up and snorted
Newborn kids they get chopped up, aborted
Planet warchild, when we pop up report it
Committin riot acts so we constantly torch it
Illest Puerto-Rock this whole process is morbid
Equipped with slaughter blocks, you get the picture-a portrait
If it ain't monetary, what's your reason for touring
All that shit you pop, to be honest it's boring
Been rockin the mic since before inter-corporate
You need to sit back and let your conscience absorb this
Before you ship that demo to them dudes in the office
Come test your skills for real in hell's fortress

[Interlude: Vinnie Paz]
I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth
Holding the four winds of the earth, so that no wind would blow on the earth
Or on the sea, or on any tree
I saw another angel ascend from the sunrise
Having the seal of the living god
He cried with a loud voice to the four angels
I'm so confused
To whom it was given to harm the earth and the sea

[Verse 3: Immortal Technique]
Immortal Technique, I live life strangling death
I walk through the land where the fallen angel is kept
But I will never bow down to a Pagan habit
Like Roman gods that were faggots named after the planets
The connotations of Revelation taken for granted
Mark of the beast, government microchips implanted
I'll be branded a maniac for speaking the truth
And I'll be murdered as soon as I hit the street with the proof
Illuminati trying to raise the devil at any cost
They probably cloned Jesus with the blood off of the cross
And I know that it's the same mother fuckers I see
That genetically engineered HIV
Controlling the population according to mathematics
Generated by Masons and the military industry
Sponsoring terror, creatin the profit margin that'll last forever
The crusades and Vietnam sand-blasted together
And you believe in "whatever", even a Federal promise
But the spawn of Shaytan could never be honest
And poor people pay homage and pray to a god
That the Vatican themselves don't really believe in
Cuz they'd rather worship money and the physical demons
Without biblical reason I execute em for treason
I don't need an alibi, cuz my place in history is the book of Malachi
Motherfucker

[Outro]
Immortal Technique; Harlem, New York and North Philly
The Angels of Death are here you motherfucker
We'll turn your cities to salt, nigga
Y'all ain't shit, and none of your peoples are shit
None of your children are shit
You'll all be dead tomorrow, you fake motherfuckers
What!?[Intro]
Let's go!
Space Pyscho Realm shit
I know ya'll hating!

[Hook x2 - Abidiel]
Soy un boxeador de la calle, tira y no falles
Puede ser que mi veneno te desmaye
Lo de vivir en la calle es el detalle para hacerlo como yo
Para hacerlo como yo será mejor que ensayes

[Planetary]
Yo, I called Sick Jacken and told that nigga I'm sick of rapping
He told me to find all the hatahs plan and get the clapping
I'm sick of yapping I told Cynic let's get the mashing
We on the flight to LA squeaking in the ratchets
Security on me like its 9/11, you betta find the Reverend
Call your fam up and try to find a blessing
No time for stressing only maculate versions
You niggas bitching put your tampons back in your purses
Shit, if Psycho betta buck down we matching the wages
We collide wit the unit and put it back in your faces
Nigga, back to the basics, I'm lacing my Chuck Taylors
Who proposed to the game, now I'm getting my tux tailored
I treat every stage like the Garden of Eden
I'm the serpent in the trees that'll stop you from breathing
The vocal, pato loco from Illadel to Acapulco
The local is locked; time to lick a shot to rock the global

[Sick Jacken]
And I read the puto thru my recital it's suicidal
Accu cycle banks so heavy that we ruin idols
And I ain't fucking wit this new arrivals
Man I been leaking off and on since the days of the unit rhinos
You rival the pussy I'm cocky they push me
I'm vynl who said, there ain't no future for minor whino
I wanna leave shit stained in the rap game
So I got a sick as clique wit the wrath of Kane
You know the name Psycho's run it like its nutting mayne
Where the million bald heads looking like fucking gangs
Worldwide symphony killing spree wit a guillotine
The shit is getting sick after clicking up wit the Philly team
My heroin rap keeps stem going back for the trap
I tap a vein, Jacks is the insane brain of the camp
We run shit like when Hussein reigned
It's the art of execution and we shoot you sane

[Hook]

[Duke]
Yeah, you can still catch me out in the streets, blazed up
You know we deep and keep running them up
I try to chill so we put the guns down
But the streets got us by the balls
Shit, it's hard not to gun out
Police keep hunting us down, they after me
Fucking swine, they ain't got nutting to offer me
We pirates in all black, bagged wit big gats
If they want some we can leave 'em rightfully stance
So that's what the fucks up (What's that?)
I keep wilding like I don't travel about the world getting my cocked sucked
I try to cool out, my goons go out, they repping that shit
The SS gun and burn down the house, take ova the place
We here for good, the shit could get scary
Like 2012 we just ain't ready
We all need to learn not sit around ready to die
Fuck that, we gonna replenish the Earth

[Crypt the Warchild]
We spit a venomous verse your head will just burst
From Pekoe to Puerto Rico we protecting our turf
So be easy you're dealing wit Made-men
Who do dirt dolo and lyrically spray gems
Digital mayhem thru the G-5 and monitors
Rhyme writ, hieroglyph you can't follow 'em
Mind spit designed sick, I start marketing
Mic booth set on fire, who let the arson in?
Your man got a froggy feeling you betta talk to 'em
Pipe bomb filled wit glass to leave 'em sparkling
Right psalms build to last watch me inside of them
Vomiting, street crash you faggots modeling
You run way bitch, walk I keep 'em wobbling
That gun play let you talk who keeps you swallowing
Blood mugs filled to the top it don't belong to him
That's why they're raising their arms singing the song wit him

[Hook][Speaking: Crypt the Warchild]
Once again, Vinnie P. OS. Louis Dogs. Yeah, my nigga Stoupe

[Verse 1: Crypt the Warchild]
I put work in this game now I'm hurtin this game
Put a skirt on your dame, I'm a squirt up her frame
I'm a worsen the pain with a verse that's insane
I'm a evil seed so the curse still remains
Sip the henney fuck the rock, tricked Jenny from the block
With my dogs every day it's good and plenty on the block
Hittin heavy when we rock, aimin steady for the shot
We spaghetti up ya knot if you ain't ready call the cops
Guerilla warfare when we duct tape civilians
If the money's hard to earn then we must take they children
Take a shot in the air let ya gun scrape the ceiling
You can ask T dub how we lust hateful feelings
Don't pass mean mugs if you love to wake for livin
We some classy thugs with a grudge to make millions
We will smash ya mug, won't budge it take millions
On some band and brother shit with size we quake?

[Hook:]
I wanna rock (come on)
Roll (come on)
Ya'll wanna set it on the block (come on)
Rock (come on)
Roll (come on)
Come one, come on
The End is near, you can taste the ground
We can smell your fear, as the army puts you down

[Verse 2: Planetary]
I got two sons a wife and a whip
And I'll never fuck ya chick that's a trifling bitch
I rock New era fitted's and Timbs
And bring ya whole crew terror every time the record spins
Who wanna battle? I'm like an animal in the jungle
Double shots of henney humble still makin crew's crumble
Let's get it in, you fraudulent cats are still bitchin
You hate, I bang Jedi and eluded in one sittin
We from space to sun shape after one take
And I'm 100% and that was one of Puns greats
Too much you sweatin and bettin ya life one me
I'm trife homie, even worst with a knife on me, quite raunchy
Heavy weighters, that make it high for heavy papers
If it come hot, if not then fuck it... I ain't petty hater
Nigga we major, manufacture the wins often
You feel the breeze when I rap think it's the wind talking

[Hook:]
I wanna rock (come on)
Roll (come on)
Ya'll wanna set it on the block (come on)
Rock (come on)
Roll (come on)
Come one, come on
Test me once, I'll take you out
You'll see the truth as the Pharaohs put you down

[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]
Snake charmer, equal opportunity hate monger
I hold the weight in my straight left like H. Harver
Vinnie chop ya fuckin head cause his blade sharper
And every rhyme I fuckin spit is a grenade launcher
I'm an insane author, a nonhuman
Who studied the? test from John von Neumann
Something happens in my brain when the guitar strum
Bitin me would be insane cause it scars lungs
These all guns, and I can handle em
You mean as much to me as uncle Sam and them
So I choose not to abuse telepathy
Cause it's dangerous like the Soviets weaponry
Let's see whos next to me, burn at the fuckin stake
Then I can throw the faggot urn in the fuckin lake
Give me a fuckin break you know what this is
Pazienza, outerspace cousin metaphysics

[Hook:]
I wanna rock (come on)
Roll (come on)
Ya'll wanna set it on the block (come on)
Rock (come on)
Roll (come on)
Come one, come on
Test me once, I'll take you out
You'll see the truth as the Pharaohs put you down
The end is near, you can taste the ground
We can smell your fear as the Army put you down[ verse 1 : Planetary ]

You gonna need a whole lot more manpower
It takes a nation of millions to budge Plan cowards
My fort built for that fourth court drill ill
Cardiovascular vernacular skill
As I dip into the Acura my stance on tilt
Gotta watch who’s in back of us, they yak got filled
And the whiskey from the Crown got me tipsy outta town
But I gotta be alert; cops hit you when you down, clowns
I ain’t tryna be Amadou Diallo
Or Oscar Grant I’d rather dance with the hollow
And strike first that’s how much the mic’s worth
With a slight urge I might enlighten the nice word
Tight verbs are righteous polite swerve
Put my temper to the cinder, colder than icebergs
And my nerves is shot, I don’t deserve this spot
I’m about to pass the torch to who’s first on the block
Now your turf get hot and now you stumbling nervous
Eyes red cause you trapped inside a dungeon with serpents
Every inch of my teeth clench, I’m hungry
Nothing satisfies my hunger like more money

[Verse 2: Crypt the Warchild]

Rock-a-bye to the world, have a nice dream
When the lights go out you hear the pipes scream
The sirens, the melody of these colds streets
My heart pumps adrenaline so I don’t sleep
Hold heat if the shit decides to hit the fan
And if it really happens then ima hit up Plan
Put my chips on the table going all in
Ride out for my family and close friends
Gotta watch those praying on my downfall
Those who like to send shots, I’ma outdraw
Something bound to happen, I’m patiently waiting
Nightmares become reality, bad situation
We celebrate life, special occasion
Solid foundation, a new day seems so amazing
Death angel wanna take you for a long ride
And if he ever comes holla man I won’t hide
So I, live life like it’s my last day
Know why, I’ve been lost inside my cash tray
So high, dazed and confused, I feel I can’t pray
Not knowing what the future holds, maybe I can’t stay[Intro Sample]
1979, all the fathers of nobel prize winners
Were rounded up by United Nations military units alright?
And actually forced at gunpoint
To give semen samples in little plastic jars
Which are now stored, below Rockefeller Center
Underneath the ice skating rink
Wouldn't wanna be there for the thaw (laughter)
Eurgh! I mean it's disgusting..

[Hook]
It's on now. We sit up in outerspace and throw bombs down
You all hype up in our face: nigga, calm down
You don't really want beef. Planet, Warchild
Your whole squad fall down

[Verse 1: Crypt, the Warchild]
I ski down from the stratos, splatter and capture the crowd
This hip hop shit, me and Planet mastered the style
Every rhyme I spit is just to pay dues
While you suffer from third degree burns, when you make moves
Unable to quake, I shake the syndrome out the children
Nose blows got you feeling stiff cold you freezing
Heavily breathing, shook in the Garden of Eden
You face Christ and pay the price, other that you bleeding
You owe ya' life, plus ya' mind, soul and body
I send caution through wind to stop the mind of Socrates
Bring on Plato, philosophies twist tornadoes
My eyes a spectrum after the rain, producing rainbows
Purposefully aim those, 16 until ya' brain close
I expose flows cold, ya' frames remain froze

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Planetary]
I was born to intensify your brain with skill
My name is ill, P that's for the Pain you feel
LA, for the Lyrics that I Aim to kill
NE, Niggers know I Entertain to fill
Train to build, Train to steal the mics from you
I might stun you, watch ya back in a bright tunnel
We spaced out, in the game for the same clout
Those who claim players, games get reigned out
Roll the talk, you've been rejected like Rosa Parks
Get torn apart, QD niggers got colder hearts
Your soul departs, here's where the explosion starts
Shit is hot, city blocks getting blown apart
We throwing darts, contaminated with fire
While my soldiers march, we blasting at ya attire
Sharp like barbed wire, missiles 'll scar liars
Decapitating ya frame and leaving ya jaw wired

[Hook x2][Scratching]
You feelin' Outerspace nigger lick two shots
We lettin' you know
You feelin' Outerspace nigger lick two shots
Bow down to something far - greater

[Crypt the Warchild]
I'm word perfect, write my words in a worse curse
And emerge versus, tear this verse in the first person
Disturbed surgeon operatin' for those hurtin'
It's most certain that shows jerkin' when my flows workin'
Most poetical, watch the game from a gold pedestal
Half man/raging bull when I stand next to you
Me & Plan identical, make it unbearable
The reason that you bleedin', the reason for needin' medical
No need to even threaten you cause talk is cheap
I breed my seeds ready to assault the street
Proceed to breathe heavy, get upon this heat
Let my lines accumulate inside a vault for weeks
My flows are sickenin' - I should be washed & bleached
I'm down to get it in you feelin' froggishly
Surround you spitter sins wit' a squad that's deep
The ground I fit 'em in, let the applaudin' teach

[Scratching]
You feelin' Outerspace nigger lick two shots
We lettin' you know
You feelin' Outerspace nigger lick two shots
Bow down to something far - greater

[Planetary]
It's me, the most evil verbalist alive
I'm sicker than one foot in the grave ready to die
My brain move, 'bout the same speed a train move
Disturbed world rap, pain moves you lame crews
Rage of angels, no wings crack halos
Smack devil's on payroll when heaven's gates close
I change clothes before rockin' a stained robe
My names gold, voice platinum my frame glow
My shoebox got 2Pac and Pun in it
I rock "Hail Mary" spittin' 'til the nuns get it
I done did it, after twenty five years
Five beers I'm buzzed, you sittin' wit' dry tears
The atmosphere's filled wit' debris & dust
My wordplay is nothing you emcees should trust
Bust back syllable gats blast triumphant
Fuck that, we killin' you cats black we run shit

[Esoteric]
Yeah, you know, it's Esoteric
7L on the fader

[Scratching]
Bow down to something far greater

[Esoteric]
Let me find out these little cats want it wit' Es
I'm at ya mum's rest, stompin' ya chest homie I'm serious
I see cats tryna get their cake up
Make a nickel, and prepare to be a dyme like make-up
The gladiator hit the ring for spars
You wanna rock, bring guitars
I can't watch the news, cause when I sneeze yo, I think it's SARS
To the point I can't think no bars, I just break ya balls
To the cats that cling to bars, to the ones in the mirror lip-syncin' Nas
I be shrinkin' stars, once I'm done wit' ya face
You gonna have to find a girl who got a thing for scars
I be liftin' motherfuckers out their mink & cars
Then I lounge in bed, g'ahead count my bread
My Boston accent will pronounce you dead
Flip a rhyme like an ounce, make sure mouths is fed

[Scratching]
Bow down to something far greater *2X*[Hook]:
It's good hell hunting season so grab you a strap
And go dummy to the max, show them boys that you'll clap, blllllat
It's good hell hunting season so grab you a strap
Fuck rap, cop a brick, cook it up and make crack

[Verse One] [Planetary]:
I'm about to take a bath in holy water
Swim in the red wine the priest about to offer
Then throw a burnt cross at the alter
Alter Beast, authors, authorizing the slaughters
I advise you, go inside your office
Officially resign cause every rhyme is monstrous
If not, I'mma knock you unconscious
I be on that Philly shit, swing like Bronx Bombers
I keep the streets packed like Yonkers
Body every verse and drive your turf bonkers
Cutting the grass, surpassing the snake charmers
Crazy in the 80s and still they cannot calm us
Waiting for that payment with the commas
Niggas keep hating we embrace them with the llamas
School Of Hard Knocks, graduating with honors
Cap and gown is more like some camouflage bombers

[Hook]:
It's good hell hunting season so grab you a strap
And go dummy to the max, show them boys that you'll clap, blllllat
It's good hell hunting season so grab you a strap
Fuck rap, cop a brick, cook it up and make crack

[Verse Two] [Crypt The Warchild]:
Y'all niggas is below average, I'm above savage
I'm your worse nightmare dipped in 'Lo fabric
Keep the flow rapid, keep my doe stacking
Keep your ho from the stage when the show happening
Hector Lavoe, Ted Bundy reincarnated
Voice box is gold, I murder cause that's how God made it
Angel Of Death, mangled off Becks
Strangle your breath, leave your corpse slumped on the steps
I run with the best, ripping out chunks of your flesh
Never regret, I ain't the one to go and reflect
The gun is possessed
And it's infected by the holy spirit
The future is now but y'all ain't really trying to hear it
My ribs touching and this ain't open for discussion
My blood rushing, your blood gushing, your mouth crushing
We cold crush 'em, foe flush 'em, they hold nothing
We coke rumming, throat cutting, so fuck 'em

[Hook]:
It's good hell hunting season so grab you a strap
And go dummy to the max, show them boys that you'll clap, blllllat
It's good hell hunting season so grab you a strap
Fuck rap {echo}

[Verse Three] [Celph Titled]:
It don't matter if you do not get a flu shot
My shots flew
In the air the guns still hot, yeah the M82A2
The same one I had on So Cold, I'm so dope at rap (cl-cl-clap)
Sledge hammer flows, I got it on smash
And y'all can take the long road, I'm crossing over the median
Bounty Hunter technology, weaponry heat seeking
Watch how I be freaking 'em, you should take a picture bitch (shit)
Can't see me? You should get your light fixtures fixed
Violate your dress code
Leave your suit vest coat
Was at your house party but I left cause all y'all played was techno
Transmit commands through subsonic sound promos
My verse coerced dolphins to shoot darts out of they blow holes
Cow ping, Yao Ming might pop shots at Elroy
How do you ring bells when you're a bellboy?
I employ, I am a boss
Harness the power of Alcatraz, Albatross
1000 proof alcohol
What?![Intro]
Who you think you're talking to?
(Outerspace, Outerspace)
Who you think you're talking to?
(I'm allowed to like cash)

[Verse 1]
What I gotta do to satisfy anybody
If my chain hang down to my dick
Then let me wear it proudly
You'd love to see me nailed to the cross
Rather then see me blowing B-Label at ya boss
Here's a "Fuck you!" to those who download my shit
And a "Fuck You!" to those who won't let me live
An open mic and a cypher won't get me cribs
And a freestyle battle won't get me shit
Y'all pussys, I'm a soldier so we don't miss
You all mushy on the inside, I'm stone cold brick
Y'all niggas want pleasure, I'mma give you pain
I'll give you beats, rhymes unlike the other shit is lame
I'm moving right past by you when I'm switchin lanes
On the highway to heaven hydroplane through rain
Tell my mom and pop your baby boy done changed
Into a grown ass man it's the same ol' same
I would never cut a throat to achieve my goals
But if you try to slow me down then you must go
The moneys more important so you must know
When I was five years old I realized it was a road

[Hook]
I ain't got to breakdance, I ain't got to freestyle just to prove I'm Hip-Hop, I'm a grown ass man
I ain't got to write graph, I'm allowed to like cash, who you think you're talking to?
I'm a grown ass man (2x)

[Verse 2]
Yo...here's a little something for them cars that be bumpin', here's a little something for them kids that be frontin'
Bills gotta get paid, sky's the limit, we're gon' do this our way, despite the critics
I don't do it for the groupies or the trifelin bitches
I do this shit for my kids, my wife and my niggas
Most important thing in life: stay real to your people
Not true to Hip-Hop, that's what the internet feeds you
Buy a car off rap, they say your soul get lost
They'd rather see you on the train or writing graph on a wall
Or rockin a backpack, baggy jeans and Vans
I'd rather rock a gaudy chain that hang down to my pants
Or a new era fitted that match my sneaks, a pinky ring so bling that shit light up the street
A big ass truck with rims, that's me and my bitch
With TV's so my kids can watch Lilo & Stitch
I got respect where I'm from, don't try to steal my shine
I'm trying to take the whole game, I hope I get it in time
Stop burning what I invent and downloading me, I ain't no MP3 nigga, it's QD

[Hook]

[Outro]
Who you think you're talking to? (Outerspace)
The combinaton ... with a dream with plans to make C.R.E.A.M. (3x)[Planetary]
Uh, we in Seattle wit the Mac the Knife and the Pharaohs
We loaded with double barrels and all the cipher & apparel
We banging the Lost Battles and everything is a gamble
'Sour Diesel' that raw purico wrapped from the gravel
We travel a vicious cycle from Illadelph to the Eiffel
My wife will walk wit a rifle, if I ask her to snipe you
Best believe the shit on my sleeve repping what I'm here for
Therefore my arm extends to who I'm here for
I'm still raw still spitting and working hard
Like King Syze walking thru them 'Labor Union' doors
Its real, conceal a weapon till the day of the election
When Bush gone it's on I'm licking at his direction
Spitting it to perfection, my ghetto report card A plus
Lay plush, new Chuckers laced up gritty
Shitty Saturdays, jewels look like Gamma rays
I'm Bobby Knight with a mic in his Indiana days
Atlanta Braves tomahawking your parade
I fuck wit Phillies, what you silly nigga
Watch what you say (I smack the shit out you)
We ducktaping whoeva the fuck hating
We leaving no prisoners, I'm a sinister son sacred

(Chorus) Planetary 2x
Hail Mary full of grace
Praise that the Lord be with us when we walking through space
Bless it, are those who rose to step in our face
We gotta get 'em, I hope they in a better place, got 'em

[Crypt the Warchild]
Nah, y'all ain't hear me on Gun Ballad or Black Christmas
Or Bloody Tears, I was busy handling my business
Me and Planet the same but we a little different
Back in the booth like we left something missing
Back wit the truth I pray to God you niggas listening
Stack to the roof like pyramids but ain't Egyptian
Use the mic as a brush to paint this diction
They gotta quarantine the lab they say we sickening
Music is like cook raw we blazed the kitchen
We got love worldwide amazing isn't it?
We Blood Brothers from another father, another mother
Rhyme guzzlers son touch us and ain't no one above us
Who put in work like us and who the fuck can judge us
We change it up a bit don't understand what's all the fuss is
We make it happen; we persevered thru all the weather
We Puerto Ricans so we accustomed to do whatever it takes
We stand firm, we stay together
OuterSpace that set in stone and remains forever
QD for life, for worst, for better
I got a hunger for blood and I thirst for cheddar

(Chorus) Planetary 2x[Hook]

Heaven, is inside you
Heaven when I ride you
Heaven, do you want me?
Is Heaven just in my mind?

[Verse 1: Crypt The War Child]

Lately I’m noticing unfamiliar faces
On my block, in my circle, them familiar places
And the sun don’t shine like it used to
These rainy days ain’t something that I’m used to
Catching myself swerving in and out of traffic
Ice-grillin niggas for no reason like I want static
Wifey telling me, “Be a little easy, daddy”
Is that a sign from God because she need me badly?
Crazy wilding, maybe I got a death wish
Blood pressure rising, anxiety got me breathless
Blood ain’t thicker than these waves that I’m riding through
Blood stained my chest as I’m laying in this hospital
Our Father, have mercy on my soul
Ready to die even though the saying gets old
The meek shall inherit the earth, I inherited worse
I inherited a curse for whatever it’s worth

[Hook]

Heaven, is inside you
Heaven when I ride you
Heaven, do you want me?
Is Heaven just in my mind?

[Verse 2: Planetary]

Things just ain’t been the same lately
Faces got crooked, handshakes got shady
My pops said it’s the popularity maybe
Yeah maybe, that don’t really add up to no gravy (Nah)
Either way, I feel I’m following my foot steps
Everywhere I go there they go where my kids rest
I can’t accept lame niggas trying to stress me
Gotta find a way to design a plan to get free
Caught me speeding with a busted heeadlight
Right through the red light, no time for me to get nice
The liquor probably make a nigga more antsy
Plus I fogot the .45 tucked in my pantry
Need to hit a phonebooth, not cause I’m Superman
Gotta make a call to tell my kids I wanna hold their hands
Give them one last hug, give mom one kiss
Shit outta luck, why it got to end like this?

[Hook]

Heaven, is inside you
Heaven when I ride you
Heaven, do you want me?
Is Heaven just in my mind?[Verse 1: Planetary]
In my historical oracle, I blast metaphorical
Editorials educating in my territorial
Get torn, heavily armed with seventy bombs
That'll blast divine like the heavenly song
Your men'll be gone
If they explore my deepest thought
I beat hearts in two then ask demons for chalk
I'm dreaming to stalk emcees in the dark I walk
Blindfolded the mind's golden, watch how you talk
My style is a art, recognize lyrical purity
All hell breaks loose like a mall with no security
The dopest vocalist, with my third eye I focus with
I proceed, flow with the speed of a Indie motorist
There's more to this than wasted, shiny chains and bracelets
I hit tracks my tongue wait for the brains to blaze it
Amazing angelic, tell it to your people
("Your mic and my mic, come on yo, no equal")

[Hook]
Illadelph is like the sun cause we shine with rhymes
Underground is like the moon you only see us at times
At times with light skies when the stars recline
Jedi Mind, Outerspace, coincide and combine
(Repeat x2)

[Verse 2: Crypt the Warchild]
I'm a hellraiser, beautiful mind that smells hatred
Yell phrases, spit heat and melt faces
Excel gracious, rugged terrain on hell’s pavement
Drinking from god’s well until my chest cave in
Wes Craven, nightmare, iron maiden
Keep the iron blazing in this dying nation
Ninja Gaiden, throw stars in constellations
Bars abominations out of satan's basement
From the land where football fans will beat the shit out you
Nuns get beat with hammers til they spit out jewels
Pits that walk astray and take a rip out you
Niggas spit clips and walk away cause they don't live by rules
And I'mma make my presence felt every inch I move
Box game is evident from all the clicks I bruise
Rhyme game is heaven sent, don’t make me rip y’all fools
Or we can pass this mic around and watch your squad get chewed

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]
Don't ever come to me with war
I've severed scores of orators
Rappers fall onto all fours like minotaurs
With Jedi Mind and the Planetary be bombing this
We staying one step above you like a pharmacist
With Ominous, detonate the bomb
Heads dread, hallucinogenics, and Vietnam
I spit a psalm, create bombs like an Iraqi
Swear on the bible and then lie to Ecclesiastes
(Assault and battery)
Battle me that'll be what splits you
Store enormous amounts of energy in a crystal
We boa constrict you, the gods are militant
You faggots couldn't go the length like you was impotent
You ignorant, your whole click is split in half
You step in Allah path, and face Allah wrath
What!

[Hook][Verse 1: Crypt the Warchild]

Let it be known we too much for these underclassmen
Fuck the lights, fuck the cameras, I want the action
I want in on anything that can get me money
For the root of evil watch how I get ugly
Completely famished, hungry is an understatement
That’s real talk, my words they under investigation
I’m never hesitating, too much time is wasted
I ain’t half-baked, my brain is never vegetating
Everybody wanna rap, gotta regulate em
Thou shall not spit in my presence, that is my legislation
Constant elevation, constant steady pacing
Deadly melodies, deadly combinations
MCs nowadays heavy population
Too many hard-looks, we gotta rock their face in
I ain’t no Indian, homie I’m a chief rocka
Goodfella capo, put you in a meat locker

[Hook]

We ain’t going nowhere, locked and loaded in here
We controlling this here, all of our soldiers is near
We ain’t going nowhere, locked and loaded in here
We controlling this here, all of our soldiers is near

[Verse 2: Planetary]

The terror’s unholy so cherish the sun slowly
The pharaoh inside of a narrow grave, you can’t control me
If I die nobody hold me, my body would rather be lonely
My soul is in purgatory waiting for Satan to scold me
If I had to go back into the old me
I’d be depressed and distraught from all of the OE
I’d rather take a fucking shot of that Cognac
Y’all niggas is bottom-feeders, the rest of y’all below that
Pharaoh clique man we deep like the Wu was
Or really like the Wu is but we be the new buzz
A few drugs got you niggas all gassed up
MP3s are like M-16s after they pass us
Ask for us, Outerspace we salute y’all
Only fuck with fam cause y’all be acting all RuPaul
My niggas rugged, we carry Louisville Sluggers
And we claiming outerspace, ain’t a fucking soul above us nigga

[Hook]

We ain’t going nowhere, locked and loaded in here
We controlling this here, all of our soldiers is near
We ain’t going nowhere, locked and loaded in here
We controlling this here, all of our soldiers is near

[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]

I’mma do what I gotta do to get the gwap
And if it’s daylight and kids is out I wet their block
Young boys, no respect, they will get their pop
I’m a G, I’m polite, let me get that opp (break bread god)
My head wrapped like the Iron Sheik
And the Desert E have your wig peeled like tires screeching
The bullet holes have you dying leaking
My beat’s savage, it speaks Spanish like I was Rican
Y’all last like y’all was culo
Son chill all of y’all grill like ?
Guns big like they was sumo
Let em bang, I let em hang like they Arturo (Blood and guts warrior baby)
I don’t call it haze, I call it smog
The drug is white girl and I ain’t talking Lady Gog
Motherfucker I’m nice at mine, y’all nice at yours?
The difference is like Nike 4s and Michael Kors[Verse 1: Planetary]
I ain’t never worship the Devil
I’m always cursing in churches, my mother heard I’m a rebel
I ran like a rebel, in 89, no baby nine
Only weapon I had was a crazy rhyme
But now it’s the 2010 era
Where I ain’t even gotta use a pen to bend letters
And you can listen to that, I recommend better
How about the Army of the Pharaohs rap trend setters
You see my endeavors are bound to end eras
My syllable send terror, you killable men tear up
I heard there’s faggots I could find you with
So don’t forget I spit shit to leave him swine flu sick
Let me remind you quick, I’m 2-1-5
Killadel county count me in I run through clicks
I can take em back to battling, my javelin jagged
I man handle ‘em, call me rap’s Marilyn Manson
I’m dancing with demons with decorated pants from them bleeding
Blasting your regions with poetry and passionate teaching
The music is leaking, it’s seeping thru the pores on tour
Still raw, still swarming with the “Storm of Swords”

[Hook]
Blood in, blood out
We run into this game until it runs out
Blood in, blood out
Am I my brother’s keeper? No doubt

[Verse 2: Crypt the Warchild]
My life on trial, ya’ll testify
My wife don’t smile, then she can slide
I don’t bite my tongue, don’t need replies
I eat cyanide before I eat my pride
Tell G “you and me”, tell Nick “you and I”
Against the world, the rest can fly
In Hell’s kitchen I baked that pie I provide
And thru them hope is kept alive
So who gonna ride when I cock it and name it
Homicide, murder, what’s the case that they gave them
Blood in my pen, dues I done paid them
Been through a lot, trials tribulation
The man in the mirror? Am I talking to Satan?
If I choose to sleep, who gonna wake them?
In this mental prison my views have escaped
I live reality, dreams I don’t chase them
Loyalty is questioned when Judas is waiting
Suicidal thoughts, who can erase them?
The glass is hourless, time keeps on wasting
I’m a psycho killer in a hospital pacing[Verse 1: Crypt the Warchild]
Hard headed, always make the same mistakes
Never learn from my lessons, sorry i don't sit and wait
War going on outside no lie
The sky is falling but its all right
Could never take my heart never hurt my pride
Karma keeps creeping trying to curse my life
No time for sleep, let it burn my eyes
I just do me why ya so surprised
I only killed the sheperd made the whole herd die
You'll never one up me no (bird?) niggas slide
I ain't with the bullshit and the bickerin'
Keep control of ya bitch, she needs discipline
Them cheer leaders need to pipe down a bit
All their blasé blah, seems kinda counterfeit
Niggas don't bring shit to the table
I put in work, i don't sit in the stable

[Hook: Planetary]
Nothings too much, nothing is never enough
Never outta touch, nothing is better than us

[Verse 2: Planetary]
Back in the lab, my pen writing blood again
Stacking up bread gotta breathe when the summer end
Cleaning all them guns again, haters never leave
I'm ready to snap but I'mma have to let it be
Glass full of top shelf still get your block delt
Dealt a bad hand while I'm sipping on a cocktail
Ice grill the dealer, sitting with my poker face
Know i knock it on the place if a nigga show the ace
Everything a gamble, listen maybe learn something
Sip a little Hennessy, sit back burn something
Everything i say clever, nigga never say never
Say what you wanna say Plan play the game better
Listen, and i still rep the same letters
AOTP QD to the rain let up
Come on, but the storm never stop here
Get your umbrellas its a hell of alot here[Ill Bill]
Murder poker, burner smoker, word to Coka
Take you from your birth to the hearse to the earth homes, nice to know ya
I spell victory “W-A-R”
Walking through your front door spraying the AR
Vaporized pools of breath, rituals of death
Twin sisters giving head holding the pistol to your head
Fuck listening to your lies, I put the pistol to your eye
Rituals with live chickens and kitchen knives
Jack up all y'all bitches, wives and your bastard children
Stabbed and killed them, threw them off the top of an abandoned building
Acid and pills, crack pipes, krillz, meth laboratories
Slaughter married victory, death buried glory
My nine pop you, TEC spray, you get bodied
Ride on you like a Hells Angel on a Harley
Heavy Metal King, emperor of the north star
Devils forever bring endless war till we all gone

[Planetary]
Burning torture papers over forty acres
Is getting more gory, haters ain’t no telling all your stories later
This a death trap, the casket close
No last kiss from moms, the gat’s exposed
I see pallbearers as victims and raw terror
It’s our era, our terror dome with a metronome don’t cause error
Toe-tag mo' fags in a little bit
Cops too, you know the boy Planet on that Philly shit
Coka, Outerspace, murder, death, kill murder
Music for the morgue, my mausoleums and y’all merger?
This is blood where the flowers grow
Livestock in a pine box where the cowards go
I hate to be brutally truthful
This a rifle, this thing could beautifully shoot you
See the bullets ricocheting off of shit you saying
Hit you point blank, official with the pistol aiming

[Crypt the Warchild]
This game is filled with parasites and opportunists
That shit y’all do is gay, that is not a movement
Too many acting goonish slash acting foolish
I stash a full clip, put em in a trauma unit
Gorilla misfit, mechanical arm
Inverted crucifix chain piece, magical charm
Turn Bible verses into tragical psalms
Y’all wanna know what type of planet we on
I’m strapped with a bomb yeah, and my pen is the detonator
Make the world collapse soon as it press the paper
Never seen a blue sky, never stressed a hater
I only hear true lies, this is what I’m made of
No time for tomorrow, never gonna settle later
I don’t two-for-ones, I don’t peddle phrases
I’m trying to rock yellow glaciers on a metal bracelet
We build the city of God and make the ghetto spacious

[Slaine]

Odds stacked against a man, push him to the brink
God’s sacrilegious plan, dog stacking hundred grands
Tell me what you, what you think
Got my butcher knife, I’ll cut you like it’s nothing
Cause it’s nothing, now you gushing in the sink
You ain’t nothing like your records, why you lying like you violent?
You ain’t calm under pressure, you just harmless and silent
Never been inside of this environment that I’m in
My city’s like a jungle and my mind’s an asylum
My moves are unpredictable, my rituals despicable
My lyrics indestructible, my ticker is invisible
Apparently these people isn’t into what I’m into
It’s simple cause my feet are firm
I never gave an inch to you
I’m mental on the instrumental, loony off the snare
Too grimy for the radio, they threw me off the air
I’m an outcast, my forecast is rough and gloomy
You can’t fucking move me dog, this ain’t nothing to me, come on![Crypt the Warchild]
I never claimed to be a Saint, nah that ain't me
I'm only saying what I ain't you should let me be
I'mma always throw stones if my house is made glass
Watch this jealous one envy, everybody feel my wrath
I've done a lot of wrong in this time and place
I take many days for granted, I despise, I hate
I'm a liar, I steal if it presents itself
I stab a nigga in the back if it affects my wealth
I cut a throat, burn a bridge if it makes me grow
Spit in the face of many people I thought you should know
But I doubt you'll understand cause you claim you perfect
I've committed many sins in this place that's worthless
Can't reconcile what I've started or express my sorrow
Don't give a fuck about today if there's no tomorrow
And I don't believe if you die that your soul lives on
When you're six feet in the hole that means you're dead and gon'
But there's a lil' part inside me that believes you there
The same part inside me that believes you care
Outta' my mind that's what they say man I got to be
If there's a place in God's Kingdom save a spot for me
Our Father

(Chorus)
When I don't know what I'm suppose to do
I hit my knees and I pray to you
Cause we don't always believe in you
But one day we gon' know the truth

[Planetary]
My grandmother just died I watched mom cry hysterical
Unbearable pain, tried to help, I felt terrible
Tears dressed her heart, when that casket arose
A white rose was handed out as we prayed for her soul
Grandpa said she a champion, heaven her trophy
That was the realest shit I heard in my life
My brothers hold me I'm falling
God I hope you're watching, I hope you're listening
A loss of life that stands so close can get sickening
What's even worst to me she ain't never met my kids
And that's something I'mma always regret long as I live
But a kiss from my mother and my wife back home
Will always mend my scars anytime I'm feeling alone
A hug from my sons always make me complete
The love I get from my niggas hold me down in the heat
I hope life is everlasting when you're under the dirt
Cause she wanted to see her son and twins that died at birth
Our Father

(Chorus) 2x
When I don't know what I'm suppose to do
I hit my knees and I pray to you
Cause we don't always believe in you
But one day we gon' know the truth
To the ones that you took away
And I know you're all in a better place
One day I'mma see your face
Cause there's a better way[Celph Speaking]
Whattup whattup whattup

[Crypt Speaking]
Yo, OS, Celph Titled baby
What's goin' down

[Celph Speaking]
My niggas, yo spit that shit

[Crypt The Warchild]
I'mma known beast sick with it full blown speech
Buryin' bones deep beneath the stone streets
Stampedin the globe deep with the Pharaohs so don't sleep
We flame arrow your dome piece but when these cannibals go eat
I'mma cannon with no leash no hammer and no heat
Spit at random anytime acapella with no beat
Believe me dog cyclop vision I see through fog
Y'all transparent niggas on tape I see through y'all
Like a crystal ball, my dogs gnaw till ya tissues gone shook
When niggas ran to they pistols to hit you hard
This games a fixed neck, go ahead and pick your card
Like playin' Russian roulette by yaself on a trip to Mars
I break atoms in the same fashion I spit these bars
Put barbwire on my mic rip it tight till it slips and scars
Outerspace get it right we shift and drift from y'all
Outerspace get it right we shift and drift from y'all

[Outerspace X2]
It's a revolution, a new state of mind
We bringin' hip hop back with new ways to rhyme
Yesterday it was dark but today we shine
Tryin' to make the best out these last days in time

[Planetary]
Stick me in a room with a track Celph Title made
No tellin' where my ink flow it's like a tidal wave
Battle emcees dog I survived those days
Now it's murderous spittin' fire those pyros crave
Makin' joints from the gutter, the grittiest rhyme
Sorry if you think I'm rude I get too shitty at times
I'm with Crypt on barstools talkin' rep, cars and pool
Tryin' to build foundation with no garage and tools
With a squad that bruise anybody who act
Outta order Q-Demented will demolish you cats
Outta water outta food, we grisslin' niggas
Don't speak, cuz you know your body fittin' in rivers
Don't sleep, those who slept can't pose a threat
We runnin' with the Army now Pharaohs to the death
We are, what you call renegades on the beat
We spit regardless, no matter center stage or the street

[Hook X2]

[Celph Titled]
Yo, first off let me say fuck you and fuck dead homies
You got beef with me you got beef with my cronies
And when it come to machineguns, we fire Tommy's like Sony
Leave you missin' from your tribe like Jahrobee
We block buster spot rushers; my shots musta'
Let off from the Glock and sprayed you down like crop dusters
I rock mustard color Timbs the same ones that busted ya chin
Celph Titled and Outerspace the spicks is at it again
Get a number four at the drive thru
See me with a 4-4 when I drive through
That's my bitch and I don't think she likes you
And all that bullshit about let there be light
It wasn't that easy plus I gave life to Christ
Immortalized my story noticed that I eternally rep
Bring mother Mary to Maury Povich paternity test
There ain't a nigga that can play me, that's preposterous G
Cuz I'll make sure ya album is released posthumously[Hook]

Nobody gets out alive until the cops arrive
It's a dirty job but somebody gotta do it
I cause more scare than Godzilla
Made the church people on your block wanna move out
Nobody gets out alive until the cops arrive
It's a dirty job but somebody gotta do it
My style is wild like pitbulls trapped in cages
Made the church people on your block wanna move out

[Verse 1: Crypt the Warchild]

Every rhyme I write is 25 to Life
Every rhyme you write don't even deserve a mic
Crossing international borders with a bomb threat
You motherfuckers haven't even left your block yet
You're a bitch, you're a ho, here's a prom dress
You wanna try to box with God it's no contest
So keep on thinking this shit is sweet
I'mma start a sandstorm and put you under the Middle East
You got it fucked up homie, I've been a beast
Reptilian tongue and my skin is deep
Rumor has it they say I'm thrown off
Until their limbs is everywhere, wigs is blown off

[Verse 2: Jus Allah]

Is that the cast of a death mass?
Is that water in a red glass?
Why, I'd thought you'd never ask, it's as legend has
There's a method to the mad, it's direct and fast
Disconnected from the guest it's a second-class
I have left a trail of debt, checks in the mail
Heads or tails, death prevails, never fails
I will never get derailed, that tip is stale
I will never get to hell, that ship has sailed
I'm refined, mastermind after cash and kind
Hand me gunshot pantomime, axe to grind
Pass into the sublime have a laxing time
Have a glass of wine, have your last act of kind

[Verse 3: Planetary]

Everything they say is irrelevant
I'm an element of rap that defines pure elegance
Elevating my residence, bigging them up
I'm in the hood rocking JMT shit in the truck
Not I Against I because I don't sleep on my stomach
I rock Heavy Metal Kings and watch the barrel of the gun twitch
You're talking dumb shit, hooting and hollering
I lift the cannon and wait for the bazooka to swallow them
I'mma do this regardless of them, I'm the original
Dirty rotten scoundrel surrounding your pinnacle
Block the perimeter, I'll hit you with the fadeaway
Got a bullet with your name on it for a rainy day

[Verse 4: Doap Nixon]

So many days, so many nights
So much money got fucked up, so many fights
So many niggas got knuckled down for no reason
So many cowards got guns but don't squeeze them
Yeah, that's just the way it is
I finally got a whiz that's ready to bless the sun with a hundred kids
So I can fall back, Ralph Lauren straw hat
Sour Diesel already showed you I'm all that
I won't stop trying to ride on you assholes
First week sales donated to Daschel
You think I'm bugging right?
But it's these zeros in my bank account
That got me saying "Nigga, floss it right"

[Verse 5: Vinnie Paz]

My brain's vast as the sky is
My heart doesn't know what die is
Pyromaniac rap, Vinnie starts fires
Only an ignorant thought ignored Osiris
And that's why the enemy lost and caught virus
Where I'm from Gods, Earths, 85ers
Y'all ain't got heat underneath it's all wires
I'm on some Samhain shit with bonfires
My whole team animal thug and born liars
You ain't aware of what any the 12 Tribes is
You're a devil who tell the enemy where God is

[Outro]

[Hook][Vinnie Paz]

I’m Abdullah the Butcher, pay respect or I’m pulling the cooker
You might as well kill yourself, I’m thrilling to push you
Even if you survive son, you still bitch
Cause I’m waiting anxiously to pull the kill switch
Your body still stiff, rigor mortis
I bring pain, it’s as raw as Kane's chorus
I seen pain that was pure as Rich Porter's
I seen brains that was poured on six corners
Listen to orders, Vinnie Paz remains heartless
That’s due to my fixation on the darkness
Just give me a forty, a idiot, and Billy Dee
You’ll see what the psychology of Philly really be
Yeah, I’m from the birth place of Rocky
My left hook to the body is like Arturo Gatti
You couldn’t stop me, I fucking brain drill
I stick around a while to witness how the pain feels
Fucking faggot

[Crypt the Warchild]

We in the game where we smash for freedoms
Raw producer’s cribs look like wax museums
We set up shop, round up and attack the region
See a hundred Puerto Ricans on Banshees leaning
We out to slaughter people, we that raw Puericos
We them revolutionists cause no law’s equal
We them executioners, guard your cerebral
Or pick your brain matter up in God’s cathedral
Don’t sleep I put a dagger to your chin
Approach you real smooth with the swagger of a pimp
Make you stagger with a limp
I’m a addict for the gin, like a Catholic for the sins
Speaking ratchets through their lips
And you passionate to live, but that chapter don’t exist
I put the ratchet to your rib and make a bastard out of your kids
Make a casket out of your crib while I’m smashing out your wizz
Have a Gatling for the kid and I’m laughing at the bitch
The most immaculate spit, most elaborate with the gift
Then dip my whole team till there’s carats on their wrists
I need Rocky finger tips, next slaughter begins
So when we step up in the spot don’t nobody forget
One

[Planetary]

I’m the type that could slaughter a syllable
You killable rap niggas spit words too pitiful
I pity the fools, I’m sick with the tools, we shitting on dudes
You need to be more hip than the news
We ruthless, untamed tiger, tally your votes
I’m number one draft pick, man endorse my quote
You heard ?, I loc, I escort my folk
We deep like dead bodies on tour, I know
We ride like Coupe DeVilles, aim, shoot to kill
OS and Jedi Mind we the truth for real
So ill we rock three pieces suits and build
Like Reservoir Dogs, in the booth I spill
I feel more official, we’re still lone on our hills
G5 shine bright like it’s stainless steel
The name is real, OuterSpace the rain is real
If you can’t stand the rain, then this ain’t your field, stupid
