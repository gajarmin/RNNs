[Verse 1]
Now let's get down to business, bitches
Cause it seems like y'all just keep on tryin to diss this
Nigga that you know that's been down for years
I've clowned for years and y'all could never fade my peers
One two three four five six seven
Nine ten Eiht you can't win
Cause all the way around nigga I gets respect
And youse a nigga that can't even get no props in your set
Tragniew Park you say huh
Wanna be rippin, but now it's time to do some set trippin
So listen close, cause I don't want y'all to miss
That I'm bout to break it down for this bitch, check it
Acacia, Poplar Maple Spruce Cedar Elm
Westside trees sprayin all the fleas
That's from the three and four hundred block P-Funk riders
(So niggas watch yo' ass at that center divider *gun blast*)
Now Aaron Tyler, tell my why you seem so tame
When I caught you at the airport, shakin like a crap game
You looked up and you seen my niggas comin
And you looked like your bitch ass was bout to start runnin
But all I wanted to do was kick a little conversation (yo whatup)
And see if we can fix this little situation
But would I fuck you up was what you wondered
Yeah, that's probably why you changed your little pager number (punk ass)
But bitches like you don't grow
You can't even look me in my eye, let alone go toe to toe
And callin me skinny, youse a clown
I'mma call you Theo, cause you weigh ninety-two point three pounds
Wack ass actor, movie script killer
Fool don't you know, Quik is still the nigga
Compton psycho, boy you oughta quit
Your records don't hit, and bitches don't jock your shit
You need to stay down you Compton clown
And get off of the nuts of the niggas with guts
Because I'm down with the Trees, I'm down with Death Row
I'm down with Black Tone, and I'm down with the fo'
So when we cross paths and I hope that's soon
I'mma boot your motherfuckin ass to the moon
You need to quit bangin under false pretense
Cause if don't make dollars, it don't make sense

[Hook]
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the pimpin commence (x3)
Because you gotta give it up to the crown prince

[Verse 2]
Now I'mma swing it to the right and, right into the left hand
Take a deep breath and, cook it like a chef and
This is dedicated to the C-P-T
No better yet T-T-P, or the niggas that look up to me
I make it my business, to be that true forever
And whenever I can come clever well that's my endeavor
So whether or not you understand, that there's only one DJ Q-U-I-K
With no C still you can't be me
Because I'm floatin in my Lex and, depositin fat checks and
Gettin mad sex while I floss the NSX and
Doin what I wanna, and youse a goner nigga
For thinkin that you can catch me slippin on a street corner
Remember Compton's in the house, and Quik is in the hood
Sippin yak with all my niggas cause it's tooted good
So don't knock it til you try it, cause Eiht he tried to knock it
But he's still walkin round with my nuts in his pocket (beyotch)
So put tha P in it represent and sip that Miller
And for those of y'all concerned, this is still Eiht Killa *gun blast*
Let me take a load off my scrotum little pest
If it don't make dollars nigga, you know the rest

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now I done sold my fuckin' soul to the shit that I kick
While you groupie ass niggas keep on ridin the dick
You oughta know that DJ Quik ain't your average everyday motherfucker
(hah) Slick like a snake cause I stuck ya
Now, I never had my dick sucked by a man befo'
But you gon be the first you little trick ass ho
Then you can tell me just how it taste
But before I nut I shoot some piss in your face
You fuckin coward, tremblin like a nervous wreck
Cause when I caught your ass, you put yourself in check
And when you left my presence, you left expedient
You ain't no fuckin killer, youse a comedian, beyotch
Tell me why you act so scary
Givin your set a bad name wit your misspelled name
E-I-H-T, now should I continue
Yeah you left out the G cause the G ain't in you
Remember that time you was rollin on the Westside
And a little brown bucket pulled up on your side
Caught at that light in your Camry in the midst of a REAL killer
Tell me did you feel a little nervous (hell yeah)
You was in the shadow of death
With two trey-five-sevens pointed at your chest, hmm
Whatchu gon do, where was your niggas that kill at
You ain't got no killers so kill dat
Holdin up your hands and beggin for a pass
You lucky they didn't just to get to dumpin on yo' ass
Cause this game you think is funny is some real shit
So you need to be more careful who you fuckin wit, beyotch!

If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the pimpin commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
I'm through playin with your punk ass
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the pimpin commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
Because you gotta give it up to the crown prince

[Outro]
Shouts goes out, to my well known road dog
What's up Dozun Tru, they don't understand it baby
They can't fade us out here on these Compton streets (beyotch)
It's bigger than they can imagine
To the whole entire Death Row family
Both sides, whassup niggas
And my nigga big Suge, known for keepin shit poppin
To my nigga Big J, my little nigga Hi-C, little straight G
And that little singin ass nigga Danny Boy
Y'all don't understand, y'all can't fade this
I'M the first nigga that was "Bangin on Wax"
Yeah if you remember, nineteen eighty-seven underground tapes
And it don't stop, and it won't stop[Intro]
Hey Suge, what I tell you, nigga
When I come out of jail, what was I gonna do
I was gonna start diggin' into these niggas' chest, right
Watch this
Hey Quik, let me get them binoculars, nigga, the binoculars
Hahahaha, yeah nigga, time to ride
Grab your bulletproof vest nigga
Cause it's gonna be a long one
Now me and Quik gonna show you niggas what it's like on this side - the real side
Now, on this ride there's gonna be some real motherfuckers
And there's gonna be some pussies
Now the real niggas gonna be the ones with money and bitches
The pussies are gonna be the niggas on the floor bleedin'
Now everybody keep your eyes on the prize cause the ride get tricky
See, you got some niggas on your side that say they're your friends, but in real life they your enemies
And then you got some motherfuckers that say they your enemies
But in real life they eyes is on your money
See, the enemies will say they true
But in real life those niggas will be the snitches
It's a dirty game, y'all
Y'all gotta be careful about who you fuck with and who you don't fuck with
Cause the shit get wild, y'all
Keep your mind on your riches, baby
Keep your mind on your riches

[Verse 1]
9-1-1! It's an emergency, cowards tried to murder me
From hood to the 'burbs, everyone of you niggas heard of me
Shit, I'm legendary niggas scary and paralyzed
Nothing more I despise than a liar
Cowards die
My mama told me when I was a seed
Just a vicious motherfucker while these devils left me free
I proceed to make them shiver
When I deliver
Criminal lyrics
From a world wide mob figure
Thug niggas from everywhere Mr. Makaveli
Niggas is waiting for some thug shit, thats what they tell me
So many rumors but I'm infinite Immortal Outlaw
Switching up on you ordinary bitches
Like a southpaw you get left
And every breath I breathe until the moment I'm deceased
Will be another moment ballin' as a 'G'
I rip the crowd, then I start again
Eternally I live in sin
Untill the moment that they let me breathe again
The heartz of men

[Chorus]
The hearts of men

[Verse 2]
My lyrical verse was so much pain, to some niggas it hurts
My guns bust and, if you ain't one of us, it gets worse
Bitch niggas get their eyes swoll
In fly mode
I'm a homicidal outlaw
And 5-0, get your lights on, the fight's on
Tonight's gonna be a fucking fight
So we might roll
My own homies say I'm heartless
But I'm a G to this til the day I'm gone, that's regardless
Ride by, niggas bow down
Thought I'd rot in jail, paid bail, well, nigga's out now
Throw up your hands if you thugged out
First nigga act up
First nigga getting drugged out
I can be a villian if ya let me
But motherfucker if ya do upset me
Tell the cops to come and get me
Rip the crowd like a phone number
Then start again, don't have no mutherfuckin' friends, nigga
Look inside the hearts of men

[Chorus]
In the hearts of men

[Verse 3]
To all my niggas engaged in making money in the fifty states
Keep your mind on your chips and fuck a punk bitch
No longer living in fear, my pistol close in hand
Convinced this is my year, like I'm the chosen man
Give me my money and label me as a don
If niggas is having problems
Smoke 'em, fire and bomb
I died and came back
I hustle with these lyrics as if it's a game of crack
Thugging is in my spirit
I'm lost and not knowing
Scar'd up, but still flowing
Energized and still going
Uhh, can it be fate
That makes a sick motherfucker break
On these jealous ass coward cause they evil and fake
What will it take?
Give me that bass line, I'm feeling bomb
Death Row, baby, don't be alarmed
The homie Quik gave a nigga a beat and let me start again
Represent
Cause I've been sent
The hearts of men[Produced by DJ Quik]

Uhh, this feel right right here, Quik
It's like it's supposed to happen this one right here
Young! God damn
Let me justify my thug on this one right here

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
It goes one o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock, Roc
Five six seven o'clock, eight o'clock, Roc
Eleven o'clock, twelve o'clock, the party bout to pop
Then, Roc-A-Fella y'all, It's your boy S. Dot
And I ain't never been to jail; I ain't never pay a nigga
To do no dirt for me I was scared to do myself
I will never tell, even if it means sittin in a cell
I ain't never ran, never will
I ain't never been smacked; a nigga better keep his hands
To himself or get clapped for what's under that man's belt
I never asked for nothin I don't demand of myself
Honesty, loyalty, friends and then wealth
Death before dishonor and I tell you what else
I tighten my belt 'fore I beg for help
Foolish pride is what held me together through the years
I wasn't felt which is why I ain't never played myself
I just play the hand I'm dealt, I can't say I've never knelt
Before God and asked for better cards at times to no avail
But I never sat back feelin sorry for myself
If you don't give me heaven I'll raise hell
'Til it's heaven

[Hook: (Madonna imitation)]
Justify my thug! {*"For you!" - Run-D.M.C.*}
My thug.. (hoping..)
My thug.. (praying..) for you
To justify my thug!
My thug.. (hoping..)
My thug.. (praying..) for you
{*"For you! Fresh" - Run-D.M.C.*}

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Now if you shoot my dog, I'mma kill yo' cat
Just the unwritten laws in rap, know dat
For every action there's a reaction, don't have me relapsin
Relaxin's what I'm about, but about mine
Don't be actin like you can't see street action
Take me back to Reasonable Doubt time
You see my mind's on the finish line, facin the wreck
I put my muh'fuckin faith in the tec, tell Satan not yet
You understand I am chasin my breath
I am narrowly escapin my death, oh yes
I am the Michael Schumacher of the Roc roster
Travellin Mach 5, barrel in my apparel can stop God
God forgive me but I can't let them deliver me to you
Until, I won this race, then eventually
My engine gon' burn out, I get whatever is meant for me
However it turns out fine, red line!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
They say an eye for an eye, we both lose our sight
And two wrongs don't make a right
But when you been wronged and you know all along that it's just one life
At what point does one fight? (Good question, right?)
'Fore you knock the war, try to put your dogs in his
Ten-and-a-halfs, for a minute-and-a-half
Bet that stops all the grinnin and the laughs
When you play the game of life and the win ain't in the bag
When your options is none and the pen is all you have
Or the block, niggas standin tight as lemons on the ave
Tryin to cop a shop - call theyself cleansin in the cash
But can't put they name on paper cause, then you on blast
Mr. President, there's drugs in our residence
Tell me what you want me to do, come break bread with us
Mr. Governor, I swear there's a cover up
Every other corner there's a liquor store, fuck is up?

[Hook][Intro]
Suwoo business on mines, blood, Bompton Inglewood, nigga. This the mothafuckin' Woo mix, on Piru!

[Hook: YG]
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back, bicken back, bicken back, bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back, bicken back, bicken back, bicken back being bool

[Verse 1]
(Woo woo!) Where I'm from you hear that, the wolves come out
Like on Bloods, what's happenin'?
(Woo woo!) Cause when it's on, we're front line
Ain't no bicken, the whole hood get brackin'
I'm from the bottoms where [?] get chest highs
Before Worldstar, head ups weren't televised
Crack sales with shoe box deposits
Homie lived outside and the cleaners was the closet
Work got swallowed, enemies got knocked off
Giver to the [?] half the nigga's top gone
Work, sold for it, young niggas flocked for it
I represent Inglewood and the whole corner pop for it
Enemies all foul, snitch when you bust at 'em
But they the enemy, fuck it, still bust at 'em
Original young gangsters, the ones with the say-so
We bicken back being bool, but on Bloods, we don't play though

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Mack 10]
It's Mack 10, Blood, what it do
I'm from the 400 block of the Q
I put the Wood on the map, niggas say what they want
But thank me for puttin' the Su in the Woo
And all I think about is money, nigga rollin' in that fast shit
What's the next move, homie, how we get the cash, yeah?
Water in that soft white, get to rockin'
I'm a D-boy, never did no flockin'
Real Inglewood nigga with a real fuckin' attitude
Blood had a 9 but the chopper is a fatter tool
It's who bangin' so we shootin' out of Rovers
And them 223 shells be knockin' shit over
Lay 'em down, spray the whole situation
You with this gangsta shit, throw up your affiliation
I wrote the book and all the rules
I can act a fuckin' fool but I'm bicken back being bool

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Do anybody remember the CPD?
Look who outlast 'em, that's that TTP
Arabian spruce, the cranberry's the juice
That we drink with that vodka cause they don't make [?]
The first platinum nigga with some big red plaques
Then Mack-10 hit the scene, that nigga had me backed
And I kept pushin', drinkin', smokin' kush and
Puttin' money back in my hood and rollin' bushes
Now who the fuck would say that? Find out where you lay at
Bring it right up to your porch, your home, stay back
Nigga I'm the unofficial mayer, a surreptitious player
And I'll burn my wallet up before I pay her, mothafucka

[Hook][Intro]
Você sabe por que é que eu falo coisas pra você?
O que você quer agora?
Você sempre 'tá querendo coisas?
Ah, agora eu entendo
Ah, você quer que eu faça isso?
OK, 'tá bem

[Verse 1: AMG]
I can be a little picky, blame the sticky icky
Pick a bottle get a glass down the sippy sippy
I see you baby keep bouncing on your tippy toes
When the beat drop dip and make your booty roll
Cold peace of work filling out your mini skirt
It's saturday night you'll prolly wear that shit to church
You sick of lame dudes frontin' wit' an attitude
Talkin bout their rims and all they damn tennis shoes
I got some grown man game for your bluetooth
I'm hot middle of winter coupe no roof
You used to sushi, vino and some calamari
You want a nigga that might grow up to be somebody
O.T resorts by the sea sand between toes
Umbrella in ya' drinks
Worldwide aim, hit me on the G mail
I brought my boy wit me so bring another female

[Hook - AMG]
Diamonds on my fingers a couple on my toes
Walked in to the party and seen so many hoes
Can You work wit that
Can You work wit that
Can You work wit that
I can work wit that
Cali to the A we speeding down the freeway
In the stretch LS baby we hood fellas
Can You work wit that
Can You work wit that
Can You work wit that
I can work wit that

[Verse 2: DJ Quik]
Let me do my job girl don't make it easy for me
Tomorrow morning make my eggs wit onions chessy for me
Come get the keys to the suite up at the Sofitel
It's room 1024, and I'mma meet you there
Take a bubble bath get the robe out the closet
And wait for me don't think I'm afraid to toss it
You hate for me to stand up cause it makes you nauseous
It's late but can't go to sleep cause your pussy gorgeous
It's quik baby I didn't drop the dj
You might find me GA showin off my LA
So many apple bottom freaks showin' belly
I might give 'em my celly take 'em to the telly
She in the doubletree suites wit her hands on hips
A look in her eyes smile on her lips
It's that soothern hospitality thats my reality
Hit the waffle house and finish wit' some alize

[Hook - AMG]
Diamonds on my fingers a couple on my toes
Walked in to the party seen so many hoes
Can You work wit that
Can You work wit that
Can You work wit that
I can work wit that
Cali to the A we speeding down the freeway
In the stretch LS baby we hood fellas
Can You work wit that
Can You work wit that
Can You work wit that
I can work wit that[Verse 1: Xzibit]
I'm heavy hearted, heavy handed, misunderstanded
Turn a permanent repercussion, I empty the cannon
I'm addicted to ganja, roll it up in the wood
Drink a gallon of Henny, throw it up for the hood
I'mma ride for my people, give my people a voice
Never followed a leader, use my weapon of choice
This is not an illusion, this is not a mirage
Conversation with God, spilling my soul out
I own assault weapons that fold out like Megatron
The iron long, drop bottom bombs on Babylon
So tag along like a dog with a vagabond
Smoke 'till the cess is gone
Niggas on their grind, put my motherfucking records on
So they can relate to the hate and the pain
To the struggle and strain
Never take it in vain, breathing one and the same
Pressure push your forehead out the back of your brain
So west

[Verse 2: YG]
'Bout to bring the coast back, 'bout to bring the coast back
Told them make it nasty like some motherfucking cognac
Pull up on your niggas like Jordan at the three line
Still in the hood, hanging like beehives
Your money like knee-high, my money like ye-high
I whip the Porsche like it's a horse, maybe say yee-ha
We striped like Adidas, and be bang like speakers
'Bout to cop a couple of houses and have more spots than cheetas
You sell with the coke, I sell with the flow
You off-brand rappers wouldn't sell/sail with a boat
You be tweeting a lot, you be talking too much
But when daytime pass, you still wouldn't bust
We can pinky-promise, but I still wouldn't trust
They talk down on me, but I still look up
Just was talking to Nip, he say he still fucked up
It's the westside, niggas get chipped like woodchuck

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
What I represent, the whole coast line
All on my back, fool, I'mma hold mine
I do it everyday, I do this every time
I got my motherfucking nine every, every time
I told you why I came, see this is all about
The way we push the east coast all the way to the south
You see us in the north, hey man, we going off
Seventeen shots, hit 'em, look, throw the molotov
Blowing up the building, I raise, everybody feel it
Everywhere a rage, you can feel me coming through
Everyday dropping down, throw everything I got
When I fly high as the sky
Walking on the clouds, say it loud
I'm so hood, nigga, too bad to be good
Looking at 'em like I wish they would
I burn 'em all every time, any place and they know they could
Step to the side anyplace, stepping up in Inglewood
I got the homies, on lock

[Verse 4: E-40]
They don't make 'em like me no more
Matter of fact, they never have, never will
They'll never be another E 4-0
I told you once before
I ain't rapping too fast, y'all just listening too slow
You may not see me on the TV channel
But in the hood I'm still hot like the left-sink handle
Mobster like Marlon Brando or should I say Tony Soprano?
I hit you with the heel of my .40 Caliber handle
Platinum and gold plaques
I was doing the damn thing while y'all was drinking Similac
Macking on mine, that's what I told your batch
She think I'm a .jpeg, she wanna get attached
Turn up like the vegetable
Speaking of vegetables, right now I'm on this medical
I got this heinous style I'm feeling mane, I'm throwed
I'm a boss, put the president on hold

[Verse 5: DJ Quik]
I got big plans to make, big dough to get
I got big tracks to rhyme on, this supposed to hit
Got big bottles to buy, big bushes to saw
Now how the hell y'all hate me and I'm just like y'all?
I need a watch that's shiny
To make the spine be the same color as the piping on the seats behind me
Diamonds in the ring, and the watch is apparent
I ain't gotta prove I'm fly; parrot
I’m Phillip Drummond producing the Mrs. Garret
If the shoe fits, ten and a half, I can wear it
I spit it like I meant it, you resent it? Splendid
I spit the four bars before this verse had ended
Whatever the trend is, I pen, this is not freestyle
I’d like to see my pistol like Lennon did
A big kid, and an even bigger adult
I'm slow flowed, I should be pushing Renault
And I'm solo, yo

[Verse 6: Kendrick Lamar]
If I said I'd be doing this at 16, would you believe me?
Or see me to be just the innocent Kendrick, you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat
I'm mashing all of my skeletons, would you jump in a seat
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of being a lawyer, a doctor
Instead of a boy with a chopper that hold the culdesac hostage
And do 'em all if they gossip
Children on the corn', stay vandalizing the option
Of living a lie, driving their bodies with toxics
Constantly drinking and drive
Hit the powder then watch the flames that arrive in his eyes
Listen coward the concept is aim it, then bang it, then slide
Out the bitch the deposit
The prize on his head that tithes probably'll go to the projects
I live inside the belly of the critics
And Snoop passed us the torch, I'mma burn you rappers with it
What's up?

[Verse 7: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, it's back on me
I guess I'll take the microphone casually
And do my thug-izzle straight from the dome
And let you niggas know that's watching at home
BET, easily, let me show you how it go
S-N double O, break down a smooth flow
Breaking like dominoes
Lay it on the table for you
Let you a little game for your mind
Get a lawyer, this is too much for you
You couldn't understand
Let me drop another plan holding my left hand
Moving my right hand, dropping the next game
Quik doing his damn thing, I'm spitting mo' flame
Preme there on the turntables cutting up shit like
Snoopy D-O double G, making you get right
Never, ever hit like, we do this like
West coast motherfucker, bust in your face like
What?Well, shit, check it out
I done found out that's there a fine line between brilliant (uh-huh)
And bein plum loco (oh fo' sho', hell yeah)

[DJ Quik]
Get back, get forward, get raised, get lowered
Do some extreme shit, keep from bein bored
Now it's double up, hoes come a nickel a dozen
They get hot and get fucked and don't remember from buzzin
That's why you don't see me, I ain't at the club
I'm chillin with my homies in the city of Hub
Because they needin more than that ho (than that ho) the big fat ho
Tryin to get every ballin nigga in the saddle (yee-ha!)
Lap dance, fat chance, hot pants, you the man
Nowadays you can't tell, watch the crotch, it may swell
You needs a pap smear; you need to know
If you got an STD, some little critters in your trap dear
Get on, me and my homies is indivisible
And don't floss money, looks better when it's invisible (yes)
We get props from Wall Street to y'all street
If ya missed it, I stay consistant, we got heat
C-P-T style, O-G me style
The D-J, Q-U-I-K with no C style
In yo' town, don't trip nigga, it goes down
And when you see me in all blue, you gon' frown
But I'm bridgin the gap, I'm rigid with rap
Money or respect bitch, I'd rather have the digits than daps (tell 'em)
So give me the haps, do you want the meat or the scraps? (c'mon)
Put heat on my naps, and now my hair look sweet on my lap (always)
Cause it's the same thang tryin to kill the gang-bang
Set examples for the kids, on how to maintain
Never be a lame brain; y'all ain't gotta feel the same pain
That put a nigga like me on the mainframe
Bow down, back up nigga, I'm hot now
And don't try to resuscitate me, when I'm shot down
Just call my homie Theo on the radio
And let him know his little homie Quiksta had to go
Because "Gangsta, Gangsta," that's what they yellin
But niggas do dirt, get caught, and start tellin (shut up!)
Talkin to you G's with no heart
We was throwin and runnin from bullets before gangsta rappin was an art
Nigga (nigga), so don't test ya bullet-proof vest (nah)
Cause real niggas do real thangs up under stress
That's from the C-P-T, young G with heart, too
Oh we still party, but now it's part II
And

[Hook]
I don't wanna party wit you.. hell naw
Cause bitch you scary
You 20 years old, with 3 kids, 7 tattoos
You're bald, but your legs are hairy
I don't wanna party wit you.. hmm, hell naw
You need to put some lotion on
Cause your skin is peelin around
Them bullet wounds on your back
You're fat, plus you're abortion-prone

[DJ Quik]
I'd rather be a young exec, than the puppet on the other end
Danglin by a noose on his neck
They can't handle me, cause I'm where the {scandal} be
An underground nigga on Arista, now there is the family
That I'mma roll wit, take control wit
Have a ball, break bread, and share the store wit
Even though I'm thirsty for money, in the worst way
I ain't go cry if I don't go platinum, on the first day
Watch me, get my hustle on with the friendly competition
Y'all got papers but I got the latest edition (extra extra)
A hundred-thousand dollars a truck, is what I crack
And if you ain't got that, keep wishin (we all about it)
And to you bitch-ass niggas in the maze
Comin at a player with {homosexual} ways
Keep lickin on that other sound
And stay north of the 105 Hip Hop heads, cause this is underground
Yeah right by the water, can't do right by ya daughter (no)
But look at all the shit that I done bought her (hmm?)
See lyrics ain't nothin if the beat ain't crackin
And these beats smackin, that's why the G's keep stackin, nigga

[Hook]
(I don't wanna party wit you).. hell naw
Cause nigga youse a scuffla
Your braids is dingy, your clothes ain't got no creases
And your lips look like you sucked a muffler
(I don't wanna party wit you).. hell naw
Cause bitch you didn't know me when you was fine as wine and thick
Now you're sick from smokin that shit
You're broke and plus you're boney

[DJ Quik]
W-E-S-T, C-O-A-S-T
That's where the hydroponic with no seeds be
So don't trip when you see me on the TV, or my CD
And my eyes are really R-E-D
See the {industry} is freak (shh shh shh), pardon me for bein speaky
Snitchin on y'all that wanna jeek me
What makes you even try that way?
Yeah I might be fly, but I don't fly that way
Hmm, even on a gallon of Cisco I could never go disco
Dude I ain't from {'Frisco}
And to these bitches y'all trippin, we ain't layin wit y'all
Just because we say we wanna fuck we playin wit y'all
This is entertainment, we tryin to make us some change
We ain't impressed by what you got up under your Hanes
Bitch that's yo' trap, and that's yo' sap
Let me spit the cap while she sit in yo' lap homie
Don't you know me? Jealous-ass niggas wanna flow me (why)
Just because yo' woman wanna blow me
On the strength I give that ho a tittie-toy
Cause I'm the only ugly nigga gettin away with bein pretty boy

[Hook]
(I don't wanna party wit you).. hmm, hell naw
Now this is how the sporty bounce
We stay away from you broke-ass niggas
Always beggin and ain't got a dime on the 40 ounce
(I don't wanna party wit you).. hmm, hell naw
Cause ho you to' back, with that ol' long ass roll
And ya stockin smellin like Avon and that horse want his 'fro back
(I don't wanna party wit you).. hmm, hell naw
And nigga I can't stand ya
And I ain't got nothin but some advice
A map, a bar of soap, some water and a towel to hand ya
(I don't wanna party wit you).. hmm, hell naw
Now I'mma be real wit it
All my fuckin life I ain't never wanted fame
But since the shit done came I gotta deal wit it
(I don't wanna party wit you)
Ya know, but I'mma do it like my homie say
Check it, I don't give a fuck about fame (fa sho)
I'd rather deal with the money, y'all can have the name
I'm out
Yeah[Intro]

Yeah (Buck! Buck!) come on y'all, it's goin' down
Shouts out to the homie D.O.C. (St. Clair) Rest In Peace Eazy-E (St. Clair)
Mm-hmm Bickups Bone Thugs-n-harmony and D.J. Quik, it's down y'all
We up in here, it's the cypher (Flesh-n-Bone)

[Verse 1: Flesh-n-Bone]

See Flesh about to gash ya
No tellin' what me and my niggas 'bout to do to ya
We smash, leavin' you niggas without your nuts when we get through wit'cha
None of this shit is new to us, everybody keep doin' us
This is the era that my dogs created, they came through in us
Who be truer than us? I wonder what you might answer
These stupid hoes keep trying but don't come close
So they can't stand us, stop trynna reprimand us
You niggas done lost yo' fuckin' mind, thinkin' you better
Just the thought of it is outlandish
I brandish an AK-47 then point it your way
"You dead" they say
I'm handing out beat downs every single motherfuckin' day!
Stay on this thug shit, there's no other way to make it bubble
I just might make shit pop but y'all don't want that kind of trouble
I'ts suttle whenever I slip into this mind state, y'all in danger
When I rip niggas apart, nothing left of them remain
So I'ma continue to let these niggas have it, and show no mercy
You fuckin' with "one man army" opponents never could hurt me
I'm playin' thuggin' when I'm on a mission, they say "It ain't fair"
You niggas done had your warning
So why in the hell y'all have to take me there?
One thing you haters got fucked up about me, I ain't never scared
Come look me in my eyes and tell me if you see any fear
Still I'm that nigga from St. Clair, if you wanna Quest where I'm from
Or where you from or them places that can't compare
You niggas ain't nothing but lust, so I just all think that it's fucked
You're lucky you'd still be breathing my nigga but not for long, oh well
They finna get touched up heavily with this...
Touched up heavily with this rhythm, I'm givin' it to you raw
Hit 'em and niggas they feel it, that's how they're done as they brope off
Stack the 5th Dog, killing these hoes off softly, bitch now die slow
I send 'em to meet lil Deo, then they get sent to meet Diablo
Adios amigo, comprende? listen the way I say and slay
Nigga don't fuck around, see I'm serving these words I spray
Face it, nev'theless the fact ain't no escape, I chop your head
Pop it off your shoulder, then bury the head along with the hatchet
You niggas hardly expect it while you feel Flesh resurrection
Look at us sick and sore from stressing
Over the million dollar question: "Something new, something new
When they gon' come with something new?"
But Layzie, Krayzie, Bizzy, Wish, and Flesh gon' come with something new
You niggas ain't never heard it like some Flesh and the rest of my crew
Since my niggas the most spittin' here goes some more they can chew

[Bridge]
High energy, strong, with the wisdom sense of a rich man
Knowledge and the rhythm, this is what I'm using to come up with these styles
So I'll interact altogether with the crouds

(Man, it's like the muthafuckin' shows is, ha my nigga, that's how the muthafuckin' shows is, come on, let's go...)
(Bizzy Bone!)

[Verse 2: Bizzy Bone]
Its the classical doc masterful savage rappers immacable
Average I spit it casual package it
What time is it niggas clock me im cuckoo, lose every muthafucking scruple
Nigga this Bizzy Bone, Google me internet style, Youtube
Hand it to the captain kirk, I'm finna cobain the kool aid
Fuck what these fools say, I'm in the county
No food for 2 days, 2 braids, a plastic bag of toothpaste and bullshit
First class to the crib, that's how the muthafucking shows is
Lean with it, Waynes world (I like that)
Come on, ha... lean with it, Waynes world, Karma throw her theme with it
Seen with it, better be better than last year, king with it
She wanted Chris 19, and I put some dream in it
Now let me put that A in the middle, right where the seam splitted
Tell one of these niggas to pass the pump and let me take a toke
Red Hot Chili Pepper, my nigga that was a good joke
5 percent of thinkin' let me poof pow be gone
Rest in peace Chris Lighty; my nigga move on
'95 eternally, weed smoking most certainly
Black widow blew perfectly, talking easy threw surgery
Supple with the serpent no slurping nobody fucks with me
Company on the move, Bone thugs-n-harmony's back to loving me!?!
See these animals outta the jungle we never will struggle I pick up the
Ball and if one of us fumble I go to the gutter
And get all my hustle it's back to the booth
Nigga let's bubble lets get in a shuffle, let's get in a scuffle
I say that we rumble and rustle up niggas we doing a cypher
Dear lord, let a nigga be humble
Y'all still don't understand, y'all rappin' fast
Stealin' my brand that's a whole new plan, man I'm just sayin'
You siphon nigga Iraqi style, duck a nigga like Pacquiao
Broke rappers get mad so fuck you niggas, with a cash smile
Im asphalt, salient salts solvents and vaults
Cripsy weed, jaws full of joints, bars, niggas lost
Faded the bron' cleveland play, Miami like Weezy stay
Get it the fuck up outta here
Cock the pump, slap the clip into the Glock and spit it fast so that I can get it
Go with it for da block lead the coppers on the corner where they sell rocks
So fitted tight like a glove acquitted
I'm OJ Simpson, I'm Michael Jackson, I'm lupe Fiasco
These muthafuckas don't understand me I'm flippin' threateningly
Leave the kitchen, cooking these scriptures in liquids
Saute that lettering in skillets of harmony
Spices, no cinnamon with one more element some rythm and
Realer than rippin' 'em, no vitamins, Biblical flowing like Gidians
Clack back me pump, hollw point mixed wit dum-dum kickin'
Rappers that laying all over the floor, shut up and listen
Its a jack move, stalking gat fools, I got some bad news
We finna get at you, kickin' that's when we pass through
Tried to leave us out the cypher, let them thugs have a glass with you
Mash with you, five niggas rappin' with a passion, fast with you
Rocks that makes me flash with you, smash with you and at you too
Bone don't move till I ask you to
See my goons will smash half of this room if I ask them to
Before I leave, better ask my dudes, ain't we the coldest group ever
Word to Eazy, nigga with attitudes, Cleveland city avenues
Crack house is the death of our mentalists
Momma lended a track and Wally my niggas
Shit grin, make me grin again, me and my niggas gettin' it in
Y'all finna be coasting to that same Bone shit again

[Hook]

[?] for a second, then the rest... [?] state of mind...
(Krayzie Bone!)
Murder murder kill kill redrum redrum

[Verse 3: Krayzie Bone]
I come with a [?] vision for all them niggas, that's ready for lyrical war
Finna do way more than just even the score
The thugs we come for blood, so guard your grill, we are the deal, we all real
Ya'll already know who that, they never seen a rapper like me
It's relevant yet em considered a throwback
Call it classic swag it's Kray askin' Jack
I pick up the mic and they all say "down bad man do that"
The game done studied me long time now, but it still can't seem to really get it
Niggas we can just admit it, my niggas the sickest with it
I pick up the pen and I go in like a surgeon
Verbally come to save a dying game cause it's hurtin'
I tell 'em to follow the leader
We keeping 'em stumbling, they better speed up
Y'all niggas can't tell me how this game don't need us, we up!
And got ball, first and ten leaving the touch down once again
The game is over niggas once I'm in
I'm sneakin' up on 'em like I was the wind and blow 'em away
And showin' 'em the way
The fuck up outta here, the storm is coming today and it's in the form of Kray
I tell 'em you should've been checked the forecast
I'm so bad, with the pen and the notepad I get up in your ass
So how in the hell is they doing the cypher
But never invited the illest spitters, realest niggas
Known to kick a little ass and after that, handle some business (Hey)
I figure they scared of the thugs just cause we too real
Still runnin' with gats and bats and hoes you finna get hit with true steel
We one in a mill, we coming to kill 'em all
Less drama more music, so don't choose it
Cause I got a pump and if it jump off I'm gon' use it
Its mister goddamn murderer, lyrically kill 'em permanent
And after I battle wit'chu, y'all gon' wanna forfeit the tournament
Competitors no concerning, hear heart beat but it never did pump no fear
So thinkin' you finna come up in this bitch and just lean on me, that ain't fair
Sick of these lil' niggas running around like Bone ain't they daddy
He a legitimate bastard
Some of them resemble me a little but none of them get it like pappy
And tell your mammy I ain't payin' on nothing, so don't even ask me
Real nigga, I still keep my heat and crease my khakis
I'm finna GET IN THE ESSENCE OF weapon cause nigga the beat done got me
They doubt me, but ask yourself just where would you be without me
Been here 20 years, many years they still ain't ready for me
I'm constant run like the river nigga, I'm steady flowing
They tell me they love me, the way that I flip it or spit the harmony with it
Created the lane and step on this gas, so nigga don't bother me with it
They know that title belong to Bone
So nigga just leave it alone, and let us move on
I'm comin' WITH LEATHER MORE LEATHER my niggas is sick with it
Really [?] with it
We on the mission to pick up the pieces and stick with it
Flow like I'm liquid, so slick with it
Roll with them niggas that used to be [?], now we just get in 'em lyrical
Niggas be nothing like me and my niggas AINT HERE BUT AINT OUTTA THE GAME IN digital
Shame these niggas don't really know that we started it fathered it birthed it
We be the heart of it
So give me the beat or melody don't really matter because I'm killing all of it
I hit em up in they mind like a NINE HEAD SPUN because its
Murder murder kill kill redrum redrum redrum

[Bridge]
Let the lil' man get a piece, fuck everybody, I slap niggas first anyway, nigga
(That's Lay right there!)
(Layzie Bone!)

[Verse 4: Layzie Bone]
Who want it with layzie nigga fuck you pay me
Been doing is since the eighties, early eighties
Nobody can fade me, my partner in rhyme is still Krayzie
And we finna break bread
The rest of them niggas got layed down and play dead
With Bizzy and Wish and Flesh, I roll on them niggas
I never did play fair, we rappers of St. Clair
The struggle the grind, the grit and the muscle
The First of the Month, Foe tha Love of the Money
That Grammy the shit, that's how I hustle
Trust me, nope, them niggas don't want no trouble
Niggas be skeletons in my bone yard, trying to show hard
Nigga I buck you, buck you, I cut like a jit su
Them niggas is going through what I done been through
I get in the cypher, I set niggas diapers on fire to show 'em what men do
They hut and attend to the order the generals call in the field
My 110 too, you 50 percent and you claiming that real
Lay, that's why I'm hard to fade, Hall of Fame
Put me up in the Hall of Fame, Layzie Bone givin' you all the game
Y'all explain what's understood and never did have to be
Savagely I ravage beats, my money attracted magically
But I had the key, could've picked the lock, instead I chose to kick the door Tragically it had to be for the ones that went form friend to foe
My thugs is indispensable, friendship is the principle
Boys to men to the end of the road, but the crossroads not the pinnacle
It's a winner though, all original, this history now I'ma make it stick
My nigga we 'bout to be Laker rich, that mystery murder man break a snitch
Taking trips, yep we party on plenty of acreage
The Bone be going for twenty years strong
Now how in the fuck can we fake this shit
Bitch, yep I ride with 2 Glocks
Stick a rapper up for his new chain, hit 'em up like I'm 2Pac
Wanna do things? I move crowds cause that bang bang get too loud
Forever they callin' me young thug cause the unplugged is the new style now
Who in the fuck is claiming the best in the business
And where's the ring that niggas is playing in? cause I'm 'bout to get wit 'em
I'm hearing king this, chrome that, all the influenced bone rap
Get ready my nigga we at it again, them other ones taking that long nap
Never met a click of five, mighty Mo Thug we still alive
FBG, yeah it's the life, Harmony Howse, and Seventh Sign
Perfect, nigga this A to Z and we workin'
Been around the globe with Steve Lo' shouts out to Full Surface
Nigga it's your time, Go time, I'ma bust in the low mine
Dangerous like a gold mine, clickin' up like Fortran
Biatch! (laugh)

[Bridge]

Wish Bone!

[Verse 5: Wish Bone]

Y'all niggas to quit that, this is real rap, y'all niggas need to sit back
[?] for the teacher, I got that
Lyrical holder, spit fire, or smotherer, or get swolled up
I'm a grown man, with a life long plan, understand that?
It could go ugly, murders, HOW OLD DO YOU THINK I AM?
But I still got hands and I put 'em on ya
FOR THE WORLDWIDE ERA formula, I warned ya
Get [?], got some ditches you bitches
At the same time, we move a life long hustle my niggas
Say sorry from the top, gotta lie, gotta have that money
Power, respect we earned that
Maintain twenty years in the game and Bone ain't done yet
You heard me, we ain't done yet
It ain't over till it's over, and it ain't over
Worst nightmare, don't you play with me
Or we can be partners, nigga get money
Lamborghini dream, empty pocket realities, that's not for me, see me
We can part on the North Side
Ride and we gon' party on the East Side
Ride and we gon' party on the South Side
Ride we gonna keep it real in the West (West) for Eazy-E
Give me my shoes and I'ma run wit 'em
My story's far from the soft nigga, and I stand wit 'em
I got what you want and what you need
Only thing that makes me Old School is this .38 Slug
No clues, no fools, and plus my bad bitch she got [?] Ooh
It's amazing these niggas still playing, still praying
And all that's lost, especially the boss, and all I know, I'm lost
Y'all niggas go ahead and do this shit, I'm done
I love you Bri Bri

[ VERSE 1: DJ Quik ]
Yo, it won't take long
For us to make a song
That you can sing along to
So bring along a few
Of your hoeish friends so I can watch 'em all squabble
Over who can suck the ick-doble
Even though your lovin just takes me out
Why I wanna kiss you with my nut in your mouth?
I'll fuck you in between your jaws of course
And that's the reason your voice got hoarse
Cause niggas like us tag-team on tour
You say you're 19, ho? Yeah, sure
And ain't no bitch that I met had a boyfrined
Lyin and they steady tryin to get in
Backstage the hooker couldn't get a fuckin pass
Went up to my homie C and showed a lotta ass
And now she's in the dressing room lookin dumb
Fuck it, help me bust a nut before the break comes

[ VERSE 2: AMG ]
It ain't nothin but a bucket full of cash and ass galore
Riches from the bitches and hoes from the shows
AMG, the king of 40oz swing
Makin money with my ding-a-ling
And big dick for the tricks that buy my jam
How about a little wham-bam thank you ma'am?
I can give you champagne, dick and a bad name
When you play the role of a dick fiend
You know what I mean?
In my Lettermore AMG runs the penis store
Buy three dicks for a dollar
It make you holler, it make you swallow
You gotta have dick control to be a 304
Cause pussy ain't nothin but a hole
And most bitches ain't nothin but hoes
So what I'm gonna do right here on this tip
Is bust that Skanless shit

[ KK ]
Yeah, doin the shit like it should be done
Slingin the shit like it should be slung
KK's in the muthafuckin house
Lil' Frog's in the muthafuckin house
Yo, check this shit out, homies
I want y'all to step to em
Won't y'all run up on the mic
Yo, kick that shit like this

[ VERSE 3: KK ]
A nigga that's too kinda crazy to fuck with
Bring on the punk shit, you might get dealt with
Cause I'm a skank takin all bank
Ain't got no time for a bitch when she stank
You better watch moms, she lookin kinda proper
Ain't up in that ass, I'mma straight have to drop her
And if yo pops wanna join in a glitch
I punk him for his belt and whip him like a bitch
Oh yeah, it's a nigga like me
A fool KK fuckin up your family
Sittin on your porch with your grandma Bell
I'm waitin for that check to pop up in the mail
I wanna fuck your sis, that ass gettin fat
She might be 15, but she 21-stacked
You mad on a fuck? The pussy ain't no bigger
See, you can still be my homie to a Skanless ass nigga

[ VERSE 4: Lil' Frog ]
I'm the F-r-o to the g, Lil' Frog
Pass me the 40, I'mma do it like a dog
Cause I'm tired of the punk-ass suckers
I said Compton, some niggas said fuck us
But you know that shit ain't gon' work
Come to my hood and get rushed to the dirt
In the streets some fools are quick to let loose a cap
Niggas with guns don't scrap
Now watch your so-called friends, they'll get atcha
They'll get jealous and jack ya
They can't fade me, gee, cause I'll cross em
Tear they ass up and toss em
Fuck a pimp and a player, that's old
Most bitches like cars and gold
So when I'm comin in a Caddy like a big daddy
Boss hog, bow down to the Frog

[ VERSE 5: Hi-C ]
One time for the nine and the deuce
Right now I'm 'bout to get real loose
Cause Hi-C's in the muthafuckin house
Turnin this shit on out
Just a little bit better than the last time
So sucker, get ready for another rhyme
And niggas get offa my dick
As I kick a little somethin like this
Once again it's the Crawf, the C-r-a-w-f
Now I'mma take a big, deep breath
Let's see..
Which happy hooker wanna mess with me
Ehm - mirror mirror, on the wall
Who is the Skanless of them all?
The mirror said, "Hi-C take no falls
Because he got a big, fat dick and balls
Maybe one day I might meet my match
Jump in some coochie and never come baaaaaaack
Cause I got girls that's deep
Dive in a pussy, drownin six feet
Now how your parents gon' tell me I need to quit
Talkin that Skanless shit
Last time I bust a nut on your little baby's head, nigga
Your child is born, now I'm fuckin the baby sitter[Produced by DJ Quik]

[Verse 1: Problem]
Nigga I'm from Compton, what up Quik? You my nigga bro

Shoutout to my nigga Villain nana crippin' even on cell day
Big Nick, Ludolph, Bird Nose, and LJ
Dice games on a 102nd and Maine
When I lose I hit [?], come back, then try to crack 'em again
Way before I hit the traffickin' game
Nowadays I'm just traffickin' game, you better get some
Get out the way 'fore I hit some, erhhh, pop

Eat a bowl of shit 'fore a bitch nigga play me
Ballin', bitch try to play me
Kobe, KDs are laced up, in the club Aced up

Chopsticks, pull it out she lock lips
Yeah, let me hit it bare then I might get her some head
Look out for [?], I'mma do it like a dare
Diamond Lane the Gang, and I bang it like a snare
On god, bow down to no man

Westside steppin'
Eastside mind state with three K's Andre
I'm an outcast, honey mmm in the house stash
We'll just take you out for the right cash
And I ain't talkin' 'bout no date
Birthday love cakes as much as Boog loves Satan
(You got served) In every way possible
Shit get hostile, I get colder than a hospital
So don't be bangin' under false pretense
Cause if it don't make dollars, it don't make sense boy!

[Hook: Sample (Problem and Childish Gambino)]
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense (Yeah)
So don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence (What?)
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
So don't kill game, let the pimpin commence (Cause I ain't playin' with your punk ass, boy)
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense (Diamond Lane, Money Gang, everything we run it)
So don't kill game, let the pimpin commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense (What up, Problem?)
So don't kill game, let the pimpin commence (What?)

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Now look who came up in this bitch
Mister look like shit, but I know he rich
Get at me, I thought you mothafuckas be happy
But they not cause they took a back seat like a taxi
I'm a latch key kid, Home Alone so often
But I had to come back to my Cali like Culkin
I was born out here, then I moved out there
Nigga check my core, man this shit ain't fair
I got a track with Alley Boy, Fredo, and Problem
So you know I'm in the hood just like I'm a cobra
Python, check the app, I'm hangin' with coders
Man that Bino goin' off, I thought that I told you
Before the [?] closed and the Crenshaw Mall
I used to date this fly girl with a place in the Dons
We used to cruise Leimert Park in a Beamer
Love a Cali girl so much, have you seen her?
Shout out to Latinas, look at all these hynas
Bino is the highest, niggas know I'm childish
I be on that Y shit, and she down to roll
Ate her pussy like a sachi teriyaki bowl
Hey yo Problem? (What up?) This a diss track right
Fuck you, fuck you, you're cool, you can't rap
You need help, you all industry hype
Most of these niggas aight
None of them holdin' a light to me
Wearin' some wifer tees, like it was '93
After the riots, niggas is violent
Sprayed the llama, took the L shit, wasn't silent though
Middle finger crossed up, niggas now you know
For real

[Hook: Sample (Problem)]
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense (Damn Bino)
So don't kill game, let the pimpin commence (Yeah)
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense ([?] night with real men, for real)
So don't kill game, let the pimpin commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense (Cause if it don't make dollars it don't make sense)
So don't kill game, let the pimpin commence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense (Compton California, that's where I'm from)
So don't kill game, let the pimpin commence (Diamond!)[DJ Quik]
Why you keep givin me cards I can't keep?
I throw these two back, you throw me two more, they're so cheap
I couldn't get the winning hand that I wanted in my sleep
Cause when the dream get good, I get trampled by sheep
Nightmares, even when I'm walkin in day
I'm havin dreams that I'm runnin but there's smoke in the way
And there's this man in a suit, he take a toke and he say
"You have a promise that you made and you broke it today."
Now which part of this movie here did I just miss?
Did I really sell my soul to this big red bitch?
I don't think what you got to offer is really enough
For cars sex and houses, money and stuff
I'd rather be broke and own nothin but piece of mind
And a Benz, and a house, and a nine-deuce-nine
Oh Top, help me out before I sink the boat
There's gotta be more than 50 ways to keep afloat
Cause I feel like I'm suffocatin, I can't breathe
I wanna go, but I'm too afraid to leave
Take me with you Mausie, I know you're seein somethin grand
As you fade away, and you gently release my hand
And it shook my balance, cause you ain't no more alive
You think I'd see you, if I drink this 45?
Oh I'd be the first person poppin three, droppin me
To the abyss, but I miss, what's stoppin me?
I got the pressures of the WORLD on my little back
My nerves are turnin into jelly and I'm bout to crack
You think I'm cheatin on my homies, by holdin back?
No I really protect them all because the truth is wack
Forever bars and forever scars
Bein trapped and dyin young makes forever stars
Tell me why am I so hesitant?
And the way life's goin, looks like when hell comes, I'mma be a resident

[Hook 2X: Wanya Morris]
La, la la-la - la, la la-la
La, la la-la - la, la la-la

[DJ Quik]
They tell me Quik, suck it up, I'm supposed to
But me and Mausberg was closer than most knew
It ain't dramatized, and it ain't a fuckin act
When you're traumatized, and it ain't no turnin back
When you're so connected, and it's hard to keep your focus
When you're so affected, and it's hard to love again
When you're so neglected - suck it up, I'm 'posed to
That ain't easy for somebody you're close to, shit
See your homey in a coffin is so wicked and vivid
It's gon' be harder on all of us, cause we gon' relive it
Over and over, drunk or sober, from October to October
I steadily feel like I'm gettin knocked over
And all the money in the world, don't make it better
And a whole bottle of alcohol, don't make it wetter
With a blur and a slur I'm still callin ya name
And on top of this drama you add fame? Wild
But when you start to bubble then your friends they spite you
And if you go to church, then hip-hop won't like you
I feel like a giant on a worldwide stage
But at the same time trapped in a real tight cage
With no way out, I play out, then I come back
Cause there's an unwritten law that says I can't be wack
So I put on my game face, go back to the same place
Only to realize that y'all ain't got the same taste
Even with somethin new, they look at you cold
And without a hot face, consider you old
And leavin me stressed and broken-hearted
How could I be finished with West coast rap? I helped start it!

[Hook][ VERSE 1 ]
Pass me the... (8 Ball) so I can get fucked up
My name is DJ Quik, so yo, what's up?
Cause I'm the baddest, I feel, gettin ill for real
With a Forty of O.E., yo, you know the deal
I'm just chillin with a Forty in hand
I'm so damn bent, that I can hardly stand
The bottle's in my face, and my lips are all around it
So stand to the side and watch me (down it)
Take it to the head without feeling no guilt
If I was you, I wouldn't fuck with me when I'm on tilt
Cause I'm a funky dope brother who just won't stop
And I like to drink the 8, cause it's good till the last drop
If I can't get it, then I get the discouraged
I gotta get a bottle of that liquid courage
I take a big gulp, and my head starts zoomin
But I'm feeling good as hell, so let the bass keep boomin
I'm DJ Quik, and the shots I'm callin
But the posse don't mind, cause we all 8-Ballin

(8 Ball)
(Here we go)
(Ah yeah)
(Take it in a bottle, 40 quart or can)
Gimme the
(8 Ball)
(Here we go)
(Ah yeah)
(Drink it like a madman, yes I do)
Pass me the
(8 Ball)
(Here we go)
(Ah yeah)
(40 ounce in my lap, and it's freezin my balls)
(8 Ball)
(Here we go)
(That vodka I was drinkin said, "Dude, go 'head")

[ VERSE 2 ]
Now a Forty only cost about $1.95
So we finna mob 17 to the liquor store
And get a case, fuck a six-pack, what's that?
I don't drink no St. Ides, so forget that
Now one nigga said that Bull got pull
Just drink a quart of O.E. and your ass'll be full
And if you don't think O.E. be workin
Then fuck it, bust the irkin and jerkin
Cause I'm a muthafucka that think when I wanna drink
And how can I tell that you're drunk? Cause your breath stink
I know you know you need some double-mint
And you can't mack to a bitch when you're too bent
So take it from me, the homie DJ Quik
You better rush your cooler, cause you might be sick
Cause the 8 is for the true niggas, and the grown-ups
But that don't matter, cause Quik got it sowed up
And punk muthafuckas wanna squab and all that
But we can get em up as soon as you pass the...
(8 Ball)

(8 Ball)
(Here we go)
(Ah yeah)
(Take it in a bottle, 40 quart or can)
Gimme the
(8 Ball)
(Here we go)
(Ah yeah)
(Bottle was empty, so we went to the store)
Pass me the
(8 Ball)
(Here we go)
(Ah yeah)
(40 ounce in my lap, and it's freezin my balls)
(8 Ball)
(Here we go)
(That vodka I was drinkin said, "Dude, go 'head")
(Here's a little somethin bout a nigga like me)
(Fuck it up, y'all)
(And here comes the...)
(8 Ball rollin)
(It'll have you trippin)
(Party)
(Cause I was drunk)
(Ah yeah)

Right about now I'm wonderin who else gone off that 8 Ball besides myself
You know all the homies goin off of it
And I know
The L.A. Posse's goin off of that (8 Ball)
And G Wayne goin off of that (8 Ball)
And Donzelli goin off of that (8 Ball)
My homie Shot is goin off of that (8 Ball)
And Playa Hamm goin off of that (8 Ball)
And Shabby Blue goin off of that (8 Ball)
And Mike P goin off of that (8 Ball)
And N.O.E. is goin off of that (8 Ball)
And Little Shawn goin off of that (8 Ball)
And Big Duck goin off of that (8 Ball)
My nigga Stinkin off of that (8 Ball)
And Lou Balls goin off of that (8 Ball)[Verse 1 - Rakim]
You off the planet, wherever you at you stand out
Plus you specialize in freakin your man out
Put it all in one pot lets see if it pan out
Stick ya hand out, I got it all planned out
Layin out the way, I set a date to wed on
Plus you got your head on, you my queen from here on
Lookin like lady Revlon with all red on
She fiending till I'm in her arms, I'm King
Put the silk bedspread on
Rose pedals and scent candle lit
Victoria's Secret set on
Rough sex turnin her on
So ghetto, innocent but scandalous just bling and fur on
Million dollar habit, she said its a fetish she gotta have it
Once she get it, she holla thats it
Keep the waters rapid
The hotter its automatic

Oh shit, she OD'n again I got an addict

[Verse 2: Truth Hurts]
He breaks me down, he builds me up
He fills my cup, I like it rough
We fuss, we brawl, we rise, we fall
He comes in late, but it's okay
He do, I do, he knows the rules
He takes care of home, though he's not alone
I'm on his team, he keeps me clean
And gives me things, he makes me scream

[Hook: Truth Hurts]
He's so contagious, returns my pages
He's got me anxious, he's what I've waited for
He keeps me guessing, spontaneous
He's so persuasive and I'm his lady

[Verse 3: Truth Hurts]
Oh! Tonight is waitin, and I ain't complainin
I'm entertainin, my number one fan
My back is achin, from our love makin
Oh yes I'm taken, ain't no use in fakin
My ups, my downs, my high and my lows
From head to toe, he makes me glow
He hits the spot, he makes me hot
I'm all that he's got, and he's all that I've got

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Rakim]
Thinking of a master plan
You know anything you need baby ask your man
You was there from a half a gram
Now it's kilos to C-notes and high fashion brands
We ball like we own the world
The only concern is you my only girl
And when we speakin in tongues
Breathing hard when I'm squeezin' your lungs
Keep it strong, but I gotta hit the streets when I'm done
It's joy and pain, when you tryin to get ahead of the game
It's fucked up, but you never complain
You just pray I don't get killed when I hit the hood
Just another hundred mill' and I'mma quit for good
No more drug wars trips to jail and shootouts
Gettin loot out for lawyers and bail'll get you boot out
Just me and you, high off sex and twisted
You OG'd and you OD: addicted[DJ Quik]
And just when you motherfuckers thought it was over
I'm back up in this motherfucker..

"You better get ready"
"for-for-for for America's most complete artist"
"What's your name boy?"
"I.. am.."	"America's most complete artist"
"You better get ready"
"for America's most complete artist"
[Quik]	Doin much damage in the ninety-two
"for America's mo-mo-mo-mo
Most complete artist-artist-ar-ar-artist"

[DJ Quik]
Now DJ Quik is the nigga that's comin up real thick
I'm a stone funkaholic yet I don't need Schick
Because there ain't another nigga more versatile
DJ Quik been bustin funky rhythms all the while
And this song is for the homies who was down with me
When I was broke as a joke, flat with no mon-ey
And to them doubtin-ass motherfuckers, cause they don't know yeah
Instead of showin and provin yo I'm provin that I'm the show
Now who wants to fade this modern day prophet?
Take two steps forward, one shell and you droppin
Because I don't go toe to toe, I go ho to ho
Yo' ho is so-so, so yo, I think I better let her go
Cause she ain't worth my time
And before I get off into another rhyme
I'ma bring this verse to a climax, grab the axe
Open the door, clear the floor, and make way

"for America's most complete artist"
"What's your name boy?"
"I.. am.."	"America's most complete artist"
[Quik]	Sucker ass niggas can't fade me
"for America's most complete artist"
"Quik.."	"What kind of name is that for a nigga?"
"for America's mo-mo-mo-mo
Most complete artist-artist-ar-ar-artist"

[DJ Quik]
Now when I say I'm complete;
That means I'm true to my game and my cap
And I refrain from bein played like a sap
And a bitch?  No bitch can handle what I'm kickin
They say I'm trippin but they stick around my room for a dickin
Cause the power of the Quiksta's too overwhelmin
And when you let me rip I'm goin in with a helmet
That's why your little brother wants to be like me
I'm surrounded by the trueness that suckers fail to see
Now 2nd II None, is you down with the Quik?  "What you think?"
Mr. Bankin, is you down with the Quik?  "Yeah, you know it"
Playa Hamm, is you down with the Quik?  "Oh but of course playa"
And everybody else.. {".. can get the dick"}
Now on my last album, I said I rolled too motherfuckin deep
That was for them suckaz that was tryin to creep
But peep the real - that when I got that murderin feelin
I can take a loss and make a killin and still be

"America's most complete artist"
[Quik]	Fuck these punk ass niggas!
"you-you-you better get ready"
"for America's most complete artist"
"for America's most complete artist"
[Quik]	Doin much damage C-P-T style
"for America's mo-mo-mo-mo
Most complete artist-artist-ar-ar-artist"
[Quik]	Yo fuck the bridge
I better take y'all into the canal, kick it

Mo pussy, mo pussy, mo pussy..

[DJ Quik]
Damn!  That's how a nigga like me is
True to it, ain't fakin for the showbiz
All the Tru ass niggas, yup ya know this
But the others jock jockin me like they ho is
Cause DJ Quik can be as funky as the douche
Shoot stutter steppin with pep but still I manage to givin the suckaz
The BOOT if they ask for it, because they know I flow it
Need I say more?  "NO!"  Well that's it

"for America's most complete artist"
"you better get ready"
"for America's most complete artist"
"What's your name boy?"
"I.. am.."	"America's most complete artist"
"you better get ready"
"for America's mo-mo-mo-mo
Most complete artist-artist-ar-ar-artist"[Pre-Hook: Mann]

I gotta bad bitch on my team
Making money I'm doing my thing
I'm the Man, Im the Man and
Im smoking weed in Amsterdam
Im all that and a dub sack
Up all night just counted my racks
Im the Man, Im the Man and
Im smoking weed in Amsterdam

[Verse:1 Mann]

Traveling across the globe
Life, Sex Drugs and Rock N Roll
First question when we stop is "Who got's the Dro"
Cause you know the youngin' got to smoke
Something proper though
Retro west coast flow for 'em
Had my first driving lessons at the Forum
Niggas envy. Ladies adore him
Everybody want to be friendly
Once they see that he on, on
On some different shit
No dirty Money, Nall Homie my shit legit
Kickin' raps making racks to spit lyrics
Man I went over seas and hit a lick
Do you want to know how much I'm making in pounds?
Man I'm breaking it down. They not making a sound
They was hating back then, They ain't saying shit now
Because im in Amsterdam, and blazing it down, Owww

[Hook]

[Post-Hook]

Double brought me over, Chase and J came with me
Got Steve lifted in the Red light District
I love my life nigga, wish that all of yall could live it
Record label budgets, Black Cards, no limits
Far from where I started but I don't feel different
Ain't shit change this should of always been my image
Young Nigga Getting it, just a young nigga getting it
That's who I was when I started thats who I'll be until I finish
Everybody I fuck with got to be Bout it
VIP section crowded and cloudy
Rolling up that loud, repping the Dannon Proudly
Smoking weed in Amsterdam where they found me

[Verse 3: Dj Quik]

A day in the Life of my main nigga Mann
Put Dj Quik on your mixtape and you can fuck up the land
Compton is the Brand, West LA got them strands of kush
That keep you walking west to see the fish in the sand
Something bout the coast, makes me want to boast
Lets do it like Julius Ceasar with Champagne and roast
White grapes and some cheese, this shit is a breeze
I'll read Jet Magazine while I check that Green
Now whats your motivation if you got no passport
Whats the situation if your bumming a newport
Sugar Free help me introduce them to new sports
Get them out the country get these niggas on a new course[Intro]
Suwoo business on mines, blood, Bompton Inglewood, nigga. This the mothafuckin' Woo mix, on Piru!

[Hook: YG]
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back, bicken back, bicken back, bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back, bicken back, bicken back, bicken back being bool

[Verse 1]
(Woo woo!) Where I'm from you hear that, the wolves come out
Like on Bloods, what's happenin'?
(Woo woo!) Cause when it's on, we're front line
Ain't no bicken, the whole hood get brackin'
I'm from the bottoms where [?] get chest highs
Before Worldstar, head ups weren't televised
Crack sales with shoe box deposits
Homie lived outside and the cleaners was the closet
Work got swallowed, enemies got knocked off
Giver to the [?] half the nigga's top gone
Work, sold for it, young niggas flocked for it
I represent Inglewood and the whole corner pop for it
Enemies all foul, snitch when you bust at 'em
But they the enemy, fuck it, still bust at 'em
Original young gangsters, the ones with the say-so
We bicken back being bool, but on Bloods, we don't play though

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Mack 10]
It's Mack 10, Blood, what it do
I'm from the 400 block of the Q
I put the Wood on the map, niggas say what they want
But thank me for puttin' the Su in the Woo
And all I think about is money, nigga rollin' in that fast shit
What's the next move, homie, how we get the cash, yeah?
Water in that soft white, get to rockin'
I'm a D-boy, never did no flockin'
Real Inglewood nigga with a real fuckin' attitude
Blood had a 9 but the chopper is a fatter tool
It's who bangin' so we shootin' out of Rovers
And them 223 shells be knockin' shit over
Lay 'em down, spray the whole situation
You with this gangsta shit, throw up your affiliation
I wrote the book and all the rules
I can act a fuckin' fool but I'm bicken back being bool

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Do anybody remember the CPD?
Look who outlast 'em, that's that TTP
Arabian spruce, the cranberry's the juice
That we drink with that vodka cause they don't make [?]
The first platinum nigga with some big red plaques
Then Mack-10 hit the scene, that nigga had me backed
And I kept pushin', drinkin', smokin' kush and
Puttin' money back in my hood and rollin' bushes
Now who the fuck would say that? Find out where you lay at
Bring it right up to your porch, your home, stay back
Nigga I'm the unofficial mayer, a surreptitious player
And I'll burn my wallet up before I pay her, mothafucka

[Hook][Nate Dogg]
She pass by... in a black Mercedes..
Damn she fine... the way her body's movin'..

[DJ Quik]
I popped the Perrier-Jouet, tryin' to get the two-way crackin'
Me and you back in the back of the back room
Actin' like you can't come back soon enough to do it rough, cause you a bluff
But I'm a winner, I could hold, watch your pretty legs fold
Stiletto to the metal, panties rose petal print
Pussy with a suttle scent, tryin' to get you double bent
And why the Oak-land, I'm the double stroke man
Sprinkle you with Gucci, rush, then I'll make your coochie bust

[Nate Dogg]
You ain't gotta ask, I'm a motherfuckin' mack and I always get my way
I wanna hit it from the back, wanna give that ass a smack
And I know you wanna taste it
I can tell by the way that she's starin', she wants to come home with me
She wanna sleep with me, she wanna play with me, she wanna lay with me
I can tell by the look in her eye when she pass by

[Hook: DJ Quik] (Nate Dogg)
(She pass by)
Can't believe I might be likin' this chick
She might be somebody's wife in this bitch
(in a black Mercedes)
But she dance like a model, make me wanna bang her full throttle
(Damn she fine)
I'm 'bout to buy her a bottle
And take her out to eat at the grotto
(the way her body's movin')
She got some meat on her bones
I love it that she takin' me home

[DJ Quik]
I brought the first Puerto Rican here and put her in the club
But L.A. niggas won't give me props, they like scrubs
They love my ho while I fuck two more
Now they shorter than a commode, I watch the game corros'
She turnin' back to her toad, walkin' 'round the players club
Tryin' to bust him a load, drunk, blue balls and trippin'
Now they hittin' the road, staggerin', kissin' the wifey
But she know I'm this old, trickin' is so cold

[Nate Dogg]
Give me - one of those and one of those and one of these
Oh let me please bring these hoes to they knees
We can do this all day, we can do this our way
If you don't wanna play you can hit the highway
Attitudes and your clothes you can leave
Come in a trench coat with some weed
We can have a party like a fantasy
It all happened that day when she pass by

[Hook: DJ Quik] (Nate Dogg)
(She pass by)
Can't believe I might be likin' this chick
She might be somebody's wife in this bitch
(in a black Mercedes)
But she dance like a model, make me wanna bang her full throttle
(Damn she fine)
I'm 'bout to buy her a bottle
And take her out to eat at the grotto
(the way her body's movin')
She got some meat on her bones
I love it that she takin' me home

[DJ Quik]
It's DJ Q-U-I-C - my new name
Fresh breathe, drunk as fuck, smashin' on the shoe game
Then the other two came, sometimes pussy feel the same
How much should I pick?, this might be a trick
But which one kills the most, the gang bangin' or the gangbang?
If the bullets ain't rubber, playa it's all the same thang
Get you some money, pussy, and try to maintain
If you rich, keep Kim, don't pull no gun on that other bitch just to keep the trim
You trippin' - and keep her out the family car, put her in the stick
If she ain't BMW material, don't be milk in her cereal
If you get payed for it then you can play for it
As short as the tambourine rings and Nate sings
And T.I.'s on the other song sayin' the same thing
The MBZ, but the pussy is free
So let me fingerbang it with champagne before

[Hook: DJ Quik] (Nate Dogg)
(She pass by)
Can't believe I might be likin' this chick
She might be somebody's wife in this bitch

But she dance like a model, make me wanna bang her full throttle

I'm 'bout to buy her a bottle
And take her out to eat at the grotto

She got a lot of meat on her bones
And she takin' me home, she takin' me homeWhoaoy whoaoy
Lord have mercy

Sometimes I smoke and I fell over joyed
Sometimes I smoke and I feel paranoid
Sometimes I smoke and I not even feel a thing
Sometimes I smoke and feel I'm going insane (lord)

To all the ladies in the place with class and taste
Allow me to place my hands on your waist

To all the ladies in the place with style and chase
Allow me to place my hands on your waist
And we can boogie till you conk out, faint like Marie
On the dance floor boppin' with me

[DJ Quik]
Now I'm not barely Alvin Ailey
But I make fly dance music daily
I may never dance the ballet in the Valet
But you just might see me two steppin' the valley
If that's a real expensive car in the alley then it might be me
Playin' hookey from your local TV
But I'm flyer than an EB, extraterrestrial biological entity with Elliot but you call him ET
Now let's get your BMX ready Let's ride it out
Let's do me like drew Barrymore and let's hivey out
Give me to call home, let's dial it out
That could cost 320 million dollars a minute, now why wait
Why not just call me gray?
Why not just call me Blake?
I spend enough time on the airplane
Why not just call me Frey?
Why not just call me late?

[Hook]

[Ice Cube]
To all the ladies, to all the ladies
From the 80's, up in Vegas
To all the ladies from 90's
You can find me wherever I be
I'm still gonna flow 2010
Still gotta about two thousand to spend
Haters in the place can't erase my grind
Stuck on my face when I'm with my friends
When I bust a rap to a DJ Quik beat
We get green just like Bill Bixby
Turn into a beast and you a beauty
Know I'm a player, will you recruit me?
I got game, and you got to tailgate
Let's have a party, girl why the hell wait
Let's have a ball, get her up from the table
If she don't wanna dance find one that say...

[Q]Now what?

[I]What up homie?
[Q]What up triple threat?
[I]You a genius
[Q]No, you a genius
[I]I'm a genius
[Q]Yeah, I'm a genius
[I]They ain't never ever seen this[ VERSE 1 ]
Now everybody wants to know the truth about a brother named Quik
I come from the school of the sly, wicked and the slick
A lotta people already know excatly where it's at
Cause it's the home of the jackers and the crack
(Compton) Yeah, that's the name of the hometown
I'm throwin down in the town where my name is all around
The suckers just be havin a fit, and that's a pity
But I ain't doin nothin but (claimin my city)
See, my lyrics I'm doublin up and provin to suckers that I can throw em
I'm passin a natural ten or four or six or eight before I go
Yes, I'm definitely freestylin, all the while still profilin
Never tricks, the DJ Quikster steals the show
So that's how I'm livin
I do as I please, you see
A younger brother that's up on reality
Cause everybody knows you have to be stompin
If you're born and raised in Compton

(Born and raised)
(Born and raised)
(Born and raised in Compton)

(Where you from, fool?)
(Compton)

[ VERSE 2 ]
Now Compton is the place where the homeboys chill, you see
But then I found that it wasn't no place for me
Cause way back in the day somebody musta wanted me to quit
Because they broke in my house and cold stole my shit
They musta thought that I was gonna play the punk role
Just because my equipment got stole
But I ain't goin out like no sucker-ass clown
They found they couldn't keep a dope nigga down
So here's some bass in your face, muthafucka silly sucker-
Ass clocker, now you're duckin, cause you can't stop a brother
Like the Quiksta, because I'm true to the game
You're lame, and things ain't gonn' never be the same
Cause a nigga like the Quik is takin over
I really don't think I should have to explain
It, oh yeah, I'm a dog, but my name ain't Rover
And I'm the kinda nigga that's feelin no pain
Sometimes I have to wear a bullet-proof vest
Because I got the 'Cpt' sign written across my chest
A funky dope brother never ceases to impress
My name is DJ Quik, so you can fuck the rest
I'm comin like this, and I'm comin directly
Cause suckers get dain-bramaged if I'm doin damage quite effectively
Rhymin is a battlezone, and suckers have no win
Cause I'm a veteran from the C-o-m-p-t-o-n
Kick it

(Born and raised)

Hell muthafuckin yeah
Funky dope for the nine-ace
DJ Quik is in the muthafuckin house
Yeah

(Born and raised in Compton)

Yo, check this shit out
Right about now
I'd like to send a shout out to my buddy Teddy Bear
What's up nigga?
What's up KK?
My buddy D
We got AMG most definitely in the house
What's up Greedy Greg and Big Baby Brian cold chillin
Talkin about the Armstrong Pack
Straight got my muthafuckin back
To my buddy NOE what's up, fool
Roche is in the house
My buddy Donzelli
You know what's happenin, fool
What's up Itch
And Tony Lang is chillin
To my nigga Gangsta Wayne
And my engineer Joe gettin busy on the flo'
And last but not least I'd like to thank Shabby Blue
And we out
Peace[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
I took two nickels and made a dime out it
I took two words and made a rhyme out it
It's hard to explain it, but I did it while I'm tainted
Steady rippin' while I'm crippin', dip the shine out
I check my rear view
I tip it down a little, just to get a clear view
I got the pigs on me, I got the dips on em
So I slide, swerve, and try to dip on em
Make a smooth getaway, so clean
My windows smoke green, my endo super supreme
When the lights hit the bitch that shit turns green
But in the daytime, that motherfucker whip cream

[Hook: Terrace Martin]
My coup baby blue
Aye Snoop, what it do?
Aye Quik, where it's at?
Kurupt start the 'Lac
So we can bounce, rock, rollerskate and
Dippin' down the shore on platinum Daytons

[Verse 2: Terrace Martin]
My eyes like a strobe light, won't stop blinking
Brains like a stop sign, I can't stop thinking
Ten shots of Patron
Fall back at the mouth, now you know it's on
Lex pass my cellphone, so I can hit Big Snoop and Quik
Stroll to the valley cause it's time to dip
And the DJ didn't already play our shit

[Verse 3: DJ Quik]
A little bit of Quik is worth all you've got
Life is like a pussy, you should you a shot
My foot is in my pool behind my big ass crib
Captain Morgan Spiced Rum, no coke, Mr. Pibb
When there ain't a menage on the back of my spot
Bad bitches just lounging, only bottoms, no bra
Ponytail on my neck, who do I think I am?
Reggae music is blasting, eight is down to a gram
Now let's go to your hood, MTV playin' jams
Niggas wearin' your couch down, wishing they were I am
You're the colour of money, and your weed looks like Autumn
And the pockets on your jeans look like they did when you bought em
I feel you nigga, I hate me too
I wish you could make these bossy player moves that I do
I'm exotic, I'm eccentric, I'm erotic relentless
And if Snoop Dogg is the king then you know who the prince is
Now crown me the Quikness
Terrace Martin, Kurupt Young Gotti, now this is senseless
Who in the world would've thought that we would get this?
Know what I think?
I think your counter-free rapper-printer is all out of ink
You missed the glory days
Not to be told when the story's phased
Cut you in the days
Chickens open up their legs and give me all their eggs
Blame them and blame me
And fuck it for that sanctity and hopin' I done pull out when I came

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Kurupt]
You call that swag? I call that jag
Snatch off with a couple scuffles, chickens, and duffle bags
Mathematician calculating ounces and grams
Miami the Amityville, skittles and candymen
High off of all types; the vikes to the sands
Yeah, hunna stunna, the manish candyman
What up? The iron in any hand
Crush em like soda cans
Aroma or green the tan as the kush burns man
The bird in the hand and some urine in the bush
Fricking seeing these Vaseline bunny rappin' rabbits
It's a habbit

[Hook][Suga Free]
No. No. The name stays on
The name's got my daddy's blood on it
The name stays on. ... got my daddy's blood on it
The name stays on. She can have half of it

[Dj Quik]
I'm a give a hand gesture
The one that I make
When I give my thumb and other three fingers a break
You get the One
No, It's not random, it's not a mistake
You get the One, yeah

[Tweed Cadillac]
Man, ya'll rap cats funny
I'm Fred G. Sanford, ya'll big ole dummies
And I ain't about to spit up on your verse
If you can't pull a little somethin' somethin'
Out your purse
I'm a vet, not a pet
So Cal Intellect, grants me a much fatter check
So, oh shit! I'm back up in the booth again
This time no looky loos gettin' in
Please. See ain't no reasonin'
Your bland. Your pimpin' needs seasonin'
I'm one of the best from the West (Tweed Cadillac Baby!)
My name's still tatted on my Ex-wife's chest
And I don't have Jungle Fever
Neither do I need a rapper rapping with me either
Ya best realize who you're dealing with
I'm on some 93 point Tweed Cadillac

[Chorus]
I don't understand ya'll niggas
And I know ya'll don't understand me
But if I have to clown ya'll niggas
Just to light a little fire
Well I guess that's just what it's gonna have to be
Yah see, I don't comprehend ya'll suckas
Opinionated, you're dumb and OG
You couldn't keep up with the city
So you moved out to the desert
And you want to blame your drama on me
Keep it Broken Down

[Suga Free]
You see the gift
Now find the gab
To each it's reach
If I don't cop, it ain't mine to have
I'm tryin' to be as clean as a ?
But in the back of my mind, I'm like get the fuck away from me
Why do you want to try to stress a muthafucka?
If I throw you a P at you, nigga, catch the muthafucka
Here's the dearly and there's the departed
The only time I like to fuck you
Is when I'm off that narcotic
You know I'm no good
I get my money in the hood
Tattoo

[Quik]
Oh yeah

[Suga Free]
Hey Quik! Blow a trick out
Ain't it fucked up when a bitch coughs while your fucking and spits your dick out?

[Quik]
Money

[Suga Free]
Give me more. Aye Quik I'm serious
Ain't that the same nigga that choked a bitch out with a gray unicorn?
Holy fish scale!
You mean to tell me, you'd rather save this bitch than save this whale?
It's mighty skeptical
Quik, all these years and you ain't gave me a Pee. ...Nah, I'm talkin' about the vegetable
And she knows it's me when I'm pullin' up
Cuz my car goes Vroom Vroom
And her daddy's easy to talk to because the whole conversation be Um-hmm
Now buckle down for the backlash
Why they call Dj Quik Dj Quik? ... that fast!

[Chorus]
I don't understand ya'll niggas
And I know ya'll don't understand me
But if I have to clown ya'll niggas
Just to light a little fire
Well I guess that's just what it's gonna have to be
Yah see, I don't comprehend ya'll suckas
Opinionated, you're dumb and OG
You couldn't keep up with the city
So you moved out to the desert
And you want to blame your drama on me
Keep it Broken Down

[Dj Quik]
You niggas buyin' Meth, I'm buyin' cookware
I'm tired of being a muthafuckin' pall-bearer
I think I'd rather be Geraldo Rivera
And tell the people what's really going on with you squares
How could I lose my identity?
How could we become our own worst enemy?
Even at the park, we don't party whatever
Not familiar, because we are hardly together
Cyber gangbangers, Internet gimmicks
How did all my fans get replaced with critics?
Went to sleep and woke up in a world full of limits
And being humble is synonomous with being timid
Niggas annoy me, so I frighten them
They stalk and hunt me down, 'til I enlighten them
And then they sex play me, sounding fruity
When you call me bitch ass nigga
Is that a female dog shaped booty?

[Chorus]
I don't understand ya'll niggas
And I know ya'll don't understand me
But if I have to clown ya'll niggas
Just to light a little fire
Well I guess that's just what it's gonna have to be
Yah see, I don't comprehend ya'll suckas
Opinionated, you're dumb and OG
You couldn't keep up with the city
So you moved out to the desert
And you want to blame your drama on me
Keep it Broken Down[Verse 1: 8 Ball]

What's the deal
What's up with a nigga, 8ball up in this
Yeah for real
Historic hits, nigga like Ali's fist
Rock the world
Get freaked by a different bunch hot little girls
Speed it up, and let a real nigga see what ya got lil' girl
Got a lil' dough, got something to blow
You wanna get like that, gimmie head in the Benz, I love a chick that suck dick like that
Dirty, southern gritty
Bouncin' through yo' city
2000 rocketship sittin' on some chrome 20's
Chopin', collar poppin', platinum droppin'
Space Age 4 Eva means that we will not be stoppin' (Yeah, Yeah)
Eightball, MJG, DJ Quik collaboration across the nation
Hittin' licks, shawty me and my niggas so official with it
Poetic pimpin', ain't no playin' when we step up in it
Like this, go all out nigga don't be scared to bust
Futuristic, what you need to do is catch up with us

[Hook 2x: Eightball]
Bounce, Bounce
Man get up on you feet and help me get it
Crunk, Crunk
Everybody up in here let me see ya
Bounce, Bounce
If a nigga trippin we gone make them heaters
Buck, Buck
Dime pieces let me see you make that ass
Bounce, Bounce

[Verse 2: MJG]
I'm a kill with the mic
Before I get buck with the gun
1-9-7-2 was the birth
Tell a nigga was the worst
You can't fuck with the one
Nigga take ya foot out ya mouth
Get ya ass off the couch
MJG bringin' the heat when Quik droppin' this beat
I know they call it rap, but I'mma rock this beat
Breakin 'em off with dope seeds
The nigga with the most of this
Coast to coast to hit
Roll the shit, Broke the shit
Kept smokin'
Then put it down on tape again
I got a fifth of Hen
Fifth of Gin
A fifth for now
And a fifth for then
Takin my time
Take it down shot for shot
You ain't got Con-gac it's not the spine
I got a stack of hoes
Matter a fact a nigga smackin' hoes
Straight up mack them hoes
If you a platinum ho, You gotta keep workin' the bitch
Don't stop and relax them hoes
A lot of niggas be claimin' to pimp
And a whole lot of pimpin' what a nigga be talkin' about
But when a bitch tell a nigga to spend some money
The mothafuckas still be walkin 'em out
Takin 'em home, givin 'em cheese, beggin 'em please
Talkin' about he'll take my ki's, big trick
See I was born to pimp for this shit
MJG equipped for this shit
Ain't no niggas in here found time
Fake ass niggas is scared of my rhyme
Pimp tight, break a bitch quick
Futuristic niggas take shit

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 3: DJ Quik]
P-I-M-P unified, MJG and Q gone try
See me gettin' down with Ball in the lopes with a bomb full of smoke
Rappin' niggas ain't no joke
So me to the front of the boards
With an MP and piano chords
Gettin' back to my evil ways
Lick him 3 times, he gone pay
Sidetrack, forgot your point
It's a 10 to 4 bet that you ain't gonna forget that
Get your peeps up off my cheese
Put your money in the pot, go squeeze
See the bright red dice just die
Shoot a whole meal, I might just try
18 thou with the jewelry on the floor
When I hit a lick don't flex no more
Gamblin', scramblin' tryin' to get up out the hood
Nothin' but scavengers and the bettin' ain't good
Show me where it's sunny at, where it's funny at
Hoes with the polished toes, I'm a money cat
Tip toe blow walkin' on a rift raft
Put that shit back in ya pocket I don't sniff that
I'm lookin' for the bud, and the brew
And some X with a broad with some thug in her jewels
(Got Sex) 6 uniforms all on my back
I was gone chill to, they didn't peep that
Had to be something else to make them irate
Give a nigga a minute let me clean the slate
No, I ain't have sex with ya wife
No, I ain't make threats on ya life
Bitch, help me get my mind off this shit with an ounce
I don't wanna see you, I wanna feel you

[Hook 2x]Another smoke session up in this motherfucker
Blaze some shit up for me Q
Yea, wussup Dogg, this is whut I'm talkin bout
Some of that gangsta shit (Eastside)
Shuttin these niggas up (Shut em up shut em up dogg)
Westcoast nigga, Quik and Snoop Dogg (Forever)
9-9 nigga

When I wake up in the morning and I get up out my bed
I feel good, o yes I do
Cause I still can give it up for you

Chorus:
Cause we're all a little strong
In the Beach, where the paper's long
But as for me
I only G when I'm buss'n rocks
Dogg Pound
(repeat)

Verse One:
Nigga, you know you gotta have heart
I told you niggas from the start
If I'm still in it, I'm in it for life
Always stay down and keep my motha fuckin' game tight
Cause ever since Elementary, or was it Pre-school Quik?
I was a motha fuckin' fool
I had to have papers it was routine
A young nigga on a mission for them collard greens
I, shake niggas
Break Niggas
Make niggas, shank theyselves
For fuckin with my wealth (nigga)
And it'll catch on
Cause if it don't, it's on
And, cuzz, I ain't even slippin' when I'm all alone
Sittin' back loungin' in the Chronic Zone
Clown me ya gone
Surround me, it's on
Get the money you're gone
My niggas' paper so long
They call him Snoop Capone
So if you want me, get me, got me
Should have shot him
But now they call me Snoop Gotti
And that's all I LBC
Betta yet, that's all I DPGC

Chorus (2x)

Verse Two:
I'm slappin' bones
In front of my home
Choppin' game on the phone
Smokin' a zone
Big 6, big 5-3's with ya bitches
My girls in the kitchen, cookin' up some fish and
I'm blastin' at this nigga that was trippin'
O, knuckle head nigga, thought I was slippin'
But I wasn't slippin', I was on deck
I blast his ass, peck peck now his shirt's wet
Dead, gone, light's out
With no remorse, I had to take him out
I'm laughin' at this shit cause it was funny
Fuckin' with the dogg I take your life and your money
And then I dip to my spot (dip dip)
And set up shop with yo rocks (motha fucka)
And nobody gon' speak on the 8-7
Cause still, all doggs go to heaven

Chorus (2x)

Verse 3:
I'm freestylin'
C-stylin'
Snoop and Quik comin' through we fin' to take you to the island
Where the bitches and the bud come free
And everybody listen to the D-O double G
Hoes on my dick, niggas on my nuts
People be lovin' me because I drop cuts
That makes sense, it make big money
See Snoop is that nigga who don't hafta play funny
But I got yo honey, up under my wing
Cause she like the song that the bow-wow sing
I'll put her in a cling
I won't buy her a ring
But I'll put her on the ho-stroll to make me some green
And even if she never even saw me befo'
There's just no way that she can tell me no
You know my game's unbelievable baby (uh uh, uh uh)
And it's strong enough to make your grandmama pay me

Chorus (2x)

West coast, gangsta shit
My nigga DJ Q
Yea
Like I told y'all
DPG for the 9-9
DPG, yea Top Dogg, fo sho'
Smoke y'all[10 seconds of instrumental to open]

[DJ Quik]
Yeah.. I wanna take this time to dedicate this song to my city
To my county - fuck it the whole state

Let me take a moment to tell you just what it is
C-A-L-I-F-O-R-N-I-A is the biz
Celebrity down to Cherokee back to the kids
Every level of livin status except for the mid
A paradise situation if that's what you make it
Red and blue equal yellow tape if that's where you take it
Forest fires and earthquakes and manmade lakes
A prescription for chronic tonic to ease your aches
And if you dress right, you can have the best night
Two or three at a time and let the rest fight
The diamonds and red gold might give you a head cold
You freeze like a Jello mold when you hit the light
On Rosecranz you can't make a U-turn
Cross the T flats and try to make new birds or shoot back
It's war and peace with no help from police
Either you restin in peace or tryin to conquer the streets
In California

[Hook] + (AMG)
Everybody want it but you can't get it
Gangster to the hustler, live to straight win it
It's California mayne (California) it's California mayne (California)
We got movie stars and we got criminals
Boys from the hood and fly saditty hoes
It's California mayne (California) it's California mayne (California)

[DJ Quik]
In Inglewood they come in yellowbone, Compton they come with shots
Carson got the smart ones, Watts got the hots
Glass houses in Linnwood, see how they hop
With the ladies gettin ready in hair and nail shops
In Bellflower Lakewood ladies taste good
It stay hood, visitin but stay if they could
With KDAY bangin out, betray us they stood
By the burger stand tellin stories on the wood
With all these dudes and all these bad broads
And all this good food and all these fast cars
Ain't no wonder why Cali got all these glad stars
Forty dollar shots gettin turned up at the bar
It's the Pacific coast {?} how could they doubt you
I did this track out of town thinkin about you
From Eureka through Ventura down to San Diego
California es en fuego, fuego..

[Hook]

[AMG]
Leather and wood, I'm good to the plus
Don't even trip, I did the shoes and the bus
76 and Crenshaw was the locale
I used to smoke out in between my vo-cals
Wherever it's cheap, wherever it's Q
Whatever California want us to do
If you in the red and they get you in blue
Represent your concrete keepin it true
And all my girls in the world, I love you all
I never want you to lose, I won't let you fall
But you gotta get better at lovin a nigga, lovin yourself
Instead of steady comin up on the wealth
I been here a while, I know a pretty smile is a trap
To pull a nigga right up out of his cap
But give me 20 minutes I can widen the gap
It's California baby on the left of the map, ah-hah

[Hook][DJ Quik] + (Voice Box)
A ha ha you don't understand me goddammit (I don't wanna eat it)
A ha ha ha nah baby I ain't wit' it (don't wanna eat it)
I can't do nothing for you on that tip girl (I don't wanna eat it)
So you can keep that salmon sandwhich to yo' self (don't wanna eat it)
Well I kick it for my niggas...
Peep

[Verse 1]
Getting right back back to the nigga named Q
Telling my homies be careful o' the things that you do
Cuz I went out, assed out
I shoulda never tripped and put my lips in between hips
But I used to eat that thang that didn't sit on a plate
Didn't taste like steak I up and left about 8
But I had to build her make for the fact that I was young
I was showing to prove the hoochies I could work they pearl tongue
But then game got kilt
Cuz the girl kept pushin' my head all up under the quilt
And I was like damn, you must be sick
You mean you'd rather have a tongue
Instead of a pair o' nuts and a stick (You goddamn right)
And every single night, I lick it till my tongue turn white
I thought I was a freak till I heard my homies brag
(Eating that coochie make you grow a mustache)Ya!
So I took that advice and right before I hit it
I took baby monkey lift it up and I bit it
Yeah homeboy I had the coochie in check
But then I got this real bad cramp in my neck
Now my back got so'
But this little ho kept a humping in my face like we was on the dance flo'
But thats what I get for having Susie Q for dinner
Got stuck in her creamy pink center
Help me

Chorus: (Voice Box)
(don't eat the coochie) You gotta hear me tho'
(don't....eat the coochie)
(don't....eat the coochie) A he he you think its a joke huh girl?
(don't....eat the coochie)

[Verse 2]
Well my nigga, you ought to save yo' self some grief
If it ain't worth havin' a little hair in ya' teeth (don't fuck with it!)
Ya cuz you'll come up sho't
With a full pair o' nuts and a lump in ya throat
Cuz even though shes screamin
She don't want ya semen
She just want a tooounge to keep her ass creamin'
But Im'a let her know baby doll I can't do it
Not in here and fuck cuz all coochie got a taste to it
See I don't know who been digging you out
And dicking ya down
I ain't the first girl so I can't clown
But instead Im'a tell you how its done
You gotta tell a ho 68 and I owe you 1
Cuz if you don't then she'll play you like a sucka
Have you lickin on a lollipop......{dumb motherf.....}Ya
But it ain't no trippin on mine {Why is that?}
Cuz tounge condoms are hard to find {Yeeeah}
And even if ya dicks protected
You can still catch the HIVe by doing a nose dive
So be cautious and don't be anxious
Even though you never could now you wanna catch ST-Statures
(Now you wanna catch ST-Statures)
But niggas still put they nuts in a frier
Then they get burnt and they wanna fight fire with fire
And then burn a bitch back
But this the song that say don't bare back
And please don't eat the coochie

Chorus: (Voice Box)
(don't....eat the coochie) Yeah
(don't....eat the coochie) You better hear me baby
(don't....eat the coochie) I can't do it girl
(don't....eat the coochie)

[Verse 3]
So now ya know
Ain't nothin' fly bout' the pearl tounge lickin'
And be real safe with the girls your stickin'
Cuz if ya' bare back way back in the day
Then you could be on your wayyyy out! (On your wayyy out!)
And it don't get no brighter
When youre walking round with a tongue like a lighter
Bic (Bic) flick sparkin' often
Sittin in the middle o' the clinic coughin'
Hurt by the die hard bare back feelin'
They got shook like kids from a shot of penicillin'
Dwellin' all in your system
Killin' ya slooow
A real jacked up way to go
So next time you get a fi-fi in ya bed
Make sure you gots you a helmet for the head
Have her wash up if the ho is a hoochie
And keep your mouth away from that coochie

Chorus: (Voice Box)
(don't....eat the coochie) Repeat 7X
You gotta hear me baby
I'm tellin' you
Do you feel me?
You gotta hear me girl
Nah I can't do it
I can come close though
I might lick ya bellybutton and shit
And we up outta here

(Oh Yeah....Oh Yeah....Oh Yeah....Oh Yeah) - Repeat 4X
(I don't want..I don't want to eat it) - Repeat 2X
(I-I-I-I-I don't wanna eat it) - Repeat 4X
(Don't Eat The Coochie)[Intro]
Yeah motherfuckers
Right back on your ass
Right about now we about to let you know that
Compton's in the motherfucking house
I got my nigga J.F.N. in this motherfucker
And my road dog K.K
We gonna put niggas to sleep in the
Four-hundred three
Check

[Verse 1: DJ Quik]
Yeah motherfucker right back up on your ass
I hid in the bushes and I crept up through the grass
What you running for bitch? You fake Irish faggot
You got a big booty Everlast let me tag it
Cause you look like a Roman but you try to clown
I kicked you in your ass that's why you jump around
So don't try to fuck with a Compton nigga
And I'mma tell you who's Daddy fuck with a trigga
Now Daddy is the nigga getting head from your Mommy
Daddy is the nigga with the gun like a tommy
Daddy is the nigga that you wanna be like
And Daddy is the nigga with your shit on his Nikes
So don't be scared just be prepared
For when you diss a nigga that you won't be spared
Little white boy how the fuck you figure
No you can't fuck with a nigga

[Hook]
(You can't fuck with a nigga)
(Thinking you wanna fade me)
(Mark Killer)
(Fool you crazy)
(Can't fuck with a nigga)
(Motherfuckers just like you)
(You'd better step before I beat you with a switch)
(You can't fuck with a nigga)
(Thinking you wanna fade me)
(Mark Killer)
(Fool you crazy)
(You can't fuck with a nigga)
(Motherfuckers just like you)
(You'd better step before I beat you with a switch)

[Verse 2: J.F.N.]
Now there's a certain type of nigga that can make you sick
Motherfucking booty and ain't saying shit
But you have to start to stepping you ain't got no style
Your white is showing like Belinda Carlyle
And the only way that you can be cool
Is if you jump your ass in the pool
Mr. Everlast went up to the Hill
To steal a style from the brother B-real
Then these no-talent fools out here getting breaks
Who the fuck better make these wack-ass tapes
The homie said squash it and just let it slide
But I gotta shoot em down in the middle of the ride
I heard your head was big but I can still crush it
Every check you lay you know we have to flush it
Fuck it pass me the brew and let me swig a
Uhh it's the funky white nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3: K.K.]
The black fool from the other side
Watch me when I who-ride
Creeping up on you from the blind side
Now here we go ho yo niggas bring it on
Four dogs barking in a dawn
Hey watch em all catch all your homies when they fall
Nothing but bullet holes left in the wall
K.K. tripping never caught slipping
Throwing three fingers to the fools that's ...
Say nigga don't you know what's up?
Coming up on to get you fucked up
Knuckle or the belt-buckle which way you want it?
It really don't matter I'm a be all up on it
K.K. all the way from LA
Still the same nigga up to no good
I'm signing out D, Quik and my nigga Hi-C
Yo you can't fuck with a G

[Hook]
