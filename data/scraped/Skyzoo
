[Verse 1]
As I think of how to begin this, I already thought up the ending
And if the ending dictates the way the start of it’s written
Then I’m really rewinding what isn’t, get it?
Swear it gets harder to get it but when you got it
To get it again’s more innocent, it’s like product
Concealing the end is in a sense how lights got us
And sealing the win’s where it begins, it’s right by us
Labeled it type bias, to be one in the same
Or maybe they might buy us, to see one of us change
Or say that they might bye us, and leave us yet again
For a gain like pills on the banners of your screen
Know to handle the regime is the handle on the lead
And the hands do extend ‘til a hand is outta reach
And the reach be the limbs that’ll balance out the means
And the means to it all will get a ski mask involved
And you winning or you swimming in a flood of the maroon type
Sheets by the dozen and you covered by a boom mic
Pardon, the most humble of an autograph
The threaded needles of Desert Eagles & honors raps
The high of thinking you can find more
The balance of the script when a shooter signs off
Ballerina fits like two inside four
All for the intrigue of a suicide door…

[Hook]
Saw the doors lifting up
And then they never came down
I mean they rode around the block with the doors lifted up
Like they was flying off the ground
And then they told us that they call those suicide doors
They said they call those suicide doors
The break lights was 100 dollar bill green
And we was green for a suicide door

[Verse 2]
And as we take this to a further route
The steps move like its word of mouth
The steps move like if they was stepping with us when we further out
So step two becomes to work around
It gets lighter than a fly knit, tighter than a eye slit
Brighter than the writer you was bright enough to climb with
Complimenting you while biggin’ up me
Just brings us up to speed to the steps that we aligned with
Then it all ties in, tied up to keep down
Or cover up your eyes when it flies like you Dee Brown
The complexities of rubbing arms next to me
It all adds to these bags of longevity
It’s like, I’m Wayne Shorter with a ratchet fetish
Or, I’m Mendecees with a jazz collection
In other words, I covet what they covered
Like overflowing cupboards spilling Gold Medal dreams
And running to the cupboard like you’re gold medal breed
Or bred, and fed how that Gold Medal steam
Meanings all over, you can pick the one that suits you
Depending the tie the accessory could lose you
See how we still twisting shit together?
Black ice dangle from the mirror that reflects us
Black ice tangled til the loop is tied off
All for the intrigue of a suicide door…[Verse 1]
Designer sweats off designer plugs
My fan base peddle crills or designer drugs
Money hand over fist like a Steiner glove
Drop jeep, box seats what I remind you of
Aura of the city, everything that I came for
In a carry-­on, I carry on like a wave board
Handing work to whoever like if my aim's gone
Fly murder forever like "get your name Lord"
Devil wears Prada, Hitler wears Hermes
I be in Celine with your queen going burlesque
Either that or Supreme, I'm supremely the deity
Crowned off the point how I weave where the needle be
And it's leaving legendary if it come to me
Rep means everything, mine means luxury
And we Tryna turn bread like Harpo
Talking Marlo with a Partlow arms fold

[Pre-­Hook]
If I don't make it bet the fam will
Watch the city fall in love with us
Clyde Frazier with the hand skills
Double rings baby, double up

[Hook]
Wore the same Balmains outside for a week straight
Fronting like we ain't rich
Baddest chick you ever seen in your life
Pulling bottles all night like she won the chip
You know we here for the luxury, yea
You know we here for the luxury, yea
Until we filthy with the bank roll, yea
Know we here for the luxury

[Verse 2]
Winning lasts forever baby, swear to God it's like we won already
Word to counting everything that we done drunk already
Only thing that they can say is that they wasn't ready
For real, salute to how we was brought up
Fly guy etiquette turned us into marauders
How I throw etiquette 'round the way they taught us
In short chains and Balmains how God want us, ha!
Luxury, see where that'll get you?
With a Cici Amor Tryna be like Karen Civil
Print game silly so my Nike Tech gorgeous
Casper the friendly, writing for the Forbes list, ha
Yea, Earl the Pearl when I'm at B
So who you love is being me, all flattery
Flattered to be what they never was
First to the money, everything is FGR

[Bridge]
Crowns all around, we about a win
Luxury talk, everybody want in
All day ones, with it til it ends
Counting up together, same as it been[Hook]
Scared to death
By this race I've run
All that's left, is everything I want
And I'm slowly losing my time
Quickly taken back from me
Seems my friends are few
Mama said prepare to pay
Cause happiness comes from money
Happiness comes from money

[Verse 1]
Money makes us happy and, happiness is everything
And everything is now and, now is more than never and
There'll never be a moment where happiness doesn't matter so
If you can quote the prices of your happy then get at us yo (4)
Get at us yo, learned it from right where you saw me posted at
Grew up holding on to it all unless there's hope attached
Cause me?, I don't hope for much, uh, if anything at all
They said your cue will depend on what you can bring along (8)
So we was bringing everything that mattered to us most
It was money and it was cars and it was habits to keeping both
It was hundreds and it was scars and they just happened to be close
It was hunger getting involved so then it was back to being broke (12)
And we just wanted a shot or 2, Melo on the follow through
Promised me it would open these doors the way that they promised you
So I just do, whatever it takes to fuck with it all
And enough to buy my way next to Jesus if I get lost, swag

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
And they say money makes the world go, money makes your girl go
Money turns some of its earners into something terrible
Ask yourself where did the person who was in the mirror go?
Why am I unrecognizable, so unbearable?
In the pursuit of paper, it was then I wasn't there with you
To do it over I'd've taken better care of you
It costs money for the birth, more for the burial
Purposely I'm saving up to purchase us a miracle
We want more but need less, desires and requests
I guess moving constantly at this rapid speed just
Effected my velocity, then the evil got to me
And strangely, it fucked around and changed my philosophy
I always heard it's not the quantity but it's the quality
In all honesty, past mistakes seem to follow me
Sometimes I feel like if my psychology will swallow me
So my apologies, what's my problem yo?, it's gotta be the money

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
And it was falling out the sky like if Doug E. Fresh was performing
And we already had too much and so we was brushing it off us
In pictures in front of back drops til like 4 in the morning
In all of this Dapper Dan for all of your dapper adornment
Or its falling on the badge in the murder of pick a name
And my name fill the blank and I'm blanked and I drift away
And you kiss my cold cheeks, chicks crying like I was Cochise, would you stand up
And send me a slow speech?, because money makes us happy and, happiness is
Everything, and everything is now and, now is more than never and, there'll never
Be a moment where happiness doesn't matter so, if you can quote the prices of
Your happy then get at us yo

[Bridge]
Money
No surrender now and no restraints
No complaints
(Lord knows the price will only raise)[Verse 1]
The moments we all waited for
Dreaming down on the first, we all paying for
More to be expected and more to get you acquainted on
We all in for the win until the parade is on
We're gone, and the drive is with the roof peeled
The AC on, providing how the truth feels
Cold, chilly chill like our demeanor be
But all of this shit is really about the scenery
Cause sightseeing's like window shopping
You might see it and proceed to believe it, you bust a move or move
You might lead it like the intro got it
You might be it and proceed to believe it, it takes you to be you
It takes us to be us, and we the same the cloth
Knotted up together forever, to rearrange was
Not in the design or the ties that bind us
We saw it and got on it, no blinders, you see it now

[Hook]
Wanted it as much as we wanted to breathe
Top down, what a beautiful scene
Saw it for the taking and wanted a piece
Saw it for the taking and made 'em believe
Know that the moment won't change
The moments that matter the most to us
Know that the moment won't change
The moments that matter the most to us

[Verse 2]
And all of this carpe diem, double parking a BM
If the legacy is right then we staring at mausoleums
But for now, know the moment is here and now, and gone forever
Envisioning what the song get us
Feeling like I'm money making Mitch, in the store like I'm broke baby
Forgetting all that I got on, ain't my ropes crazy?
I'm in this bitch looking like I sell dope baby
To these women I sell hope baby
Shit I swear I'm just my daddy all over again
The only one on the block so now we all like him
Tell the money, I want the love, baby I want the love
For all the right reasons that may just be from above
I came up where you see the paper and fall in love
And the only way you got your Mercedes was off of drugs
They put it front and center while I saw around the corner
But the same one was parked around the corner, explains why we...[Hook]
All day, always
All of us is for it
Ain't a song change
All the shit we saw is what we all became
And we all that we got 'long as the song plays

[Verse]
We hung out in front of the corner store
Got older and took it to the liquor store
Money low, so bet we wanted more
Only way we'll separate is how we pick the course
Of course we, know where we belong, we
Nowhere next to home but won't be long until we home, see
Know that when we home we putting on where they can all see
Know that they'll adore how we adorn so as long as we
Loaded up with cargo, whichever way the car go
The outcome's a murcielago
Mercy upon anyone feeling mercy at their heart tho
My outcome's a merciless God flow
God be with us, a R&B bitch is enough to inspire us
And we Dej Loaf for that loaf if they comfortable trying us
See?, baby it's easy to adapt to what you be around
Being next to A' is why my aim will never see the ground
Being next to Bro is why you know we all or nothing right?
Being next to Mel we never fell, we never cut the lights
Being next to Paesoes
Was GQ and Bishop before their hiccups
Cause loyalty is nothing you can pay fo'
Love him like brother, that man there like my brother
And if it ever should come to it that man would let a K' go
So going for advancement is the root we would stand in
Scared of being dormant so, we grew with our hands in
Hands put together, all the prayers people sent us
Saying don't believe the hype, don't grow up to be a ni**er
Don't grow up and become a typical ni**er while you here
Like who you with every day, leave them ni**as over there
What?, damn, I feel funny even saying that
That word is foreign and my friends could never make me that
Duly noted if needed but know it never will
Easy to adapt when you around whatever's real[Verse 1]
I go to sleep and see a ki'
Tucked inside a duffle Tryna be up outta reach
It's like it came to life and it was sweet enough to speak
Told me call a couple friends of yours and lead me to the street right?, peep it
I go to sleep and see a key, opening a Rover
Same way they used to show us
Told em pay us like you owe us but attention you can keep
Said it's better when it's quiet baby slip that underneath
So to tuck away the convo, conversing in morse code
Seem like everything it should be, til they're beyond those
Putting everything on your leap unless the alarm broke
A ki' might lead to a key to where Nia Long go
Visionary riches turn to missionary missions
But fuck if I'm sitting still unless I'm sitting near a digit
Bet you you'll reconsider if you consider where we get it
The sweetest shit that you ever dreamed, til you arisen like wait, hold up

[Hook]
I go to sleep and see a ki'
Sleep kinda different
When it's begging you to get it
I mean, peep it
I go to sleep and see a ki'
Sleep is out the norm
But I'm wit it til the morn
At least, peep it

[Verse 2]
I go to sleep and see a kilo
Dressed as opportunity, hand over the peep hole
Collecting my gratuity, married to the reload
As long as we repeating we'll never be with the repo's
Call it how it be but we'll never be with the belows
If we looking underneath then we looking up under seats
Now look up at your beliefs, and down at your wrist
Then you look up at what you need and blow it down on a flip
I'm just looking to get a key, the one for the door furthest
And the dream turned into short orders and tall murders
With a fist full of dollars ignorance is so blissful
Wishful in thinking where that ignorance can get you
Get us where we need and we'll call it even and leave
Oversleep cause you know it's easier there to breathe
And sleeping in the thought of the above off the love
Til the lock is all plugged and you banking on a key, you get it?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Starting to think I need counseling
Cause when I go to sleep I see 36 ounces
Damn, all I remember was the bouncers telling me put the smoke out
Tryna move this coke out, woke up in a cold sweat, then I broke out
Trine go back where I left, it ain't right tho
You know I'm in the kitchen to chef, straight nitro
Fiends say when they take a hit, it make the pipe glow
Hoping I see the same shit the next night yo
Great powder, we usually don't allow it
If this is what it's about, I'ma need my 8 hours
Cause dreams come true at the end of the day
Pray before I wake that I finish the yay
When you don't recognize your blessings you send 'em away
But let's keep that on the d­low
When I go to sleep I see a kilo

[Outro]
Baby, you need me. Wake up for me. I know you see me
When you wake up baby, come to me
Come back to me baby, let me be yours
Te voy a enseñar lo que puede llegar a ser conmigo
Todo lo que siempre has deseado era real puede llegar a ser real para ti papi
Lead me to the street, come see me baby[Verse 1]
The scene set for you to kill the room
Blowing kisses while you hitting everything that move
Murder when attention seems to get to you
My attention all that matters til it's getting thru
Thru to what I need most, usually what I keep close
Close enough to where you knew it like if we home
Told that I be stretching, we can see how far my reach go
Then I can reload, uh, and hit repeat mode
Pardon, I'm just a fan of better moments
And sitting with this bottle's where I stand to let you know it
Truth by the shot glass, handle what I'm throwing
And catching Avion got you handing me your phone and
I proceed before I leave like "she got me where she want me"
But a win is for the win, winning lotto ticket money
Going for it in your message saying we gonn' see
And how your coat still smells like Givenchy and that you love it

[Hook]
Baby I just want the time to show you how
I can be your favorite kind throughout the crowd
Cause we steady chasing
And we were playing favorites
And we became one

[Verse 2]
Told you what it'd be like, and what you should expect
It all came to you off the rip, no regrets
They ask you if you good, you think of how I rep
And your eyes get wide, you ain't dealing with your ex
Cause you know how I rep, your crew start to notice it
Seen it in your step, my name all over it
Same rules apply, you see it all up mine
So when we step as a pair, every pair step aside
Reason to believe whoever I used to be
Is aside with them steps, say bye to who they seen
Say hi to knowing me, and hi to who you be
Cause being in the now is the high that you need
And product is the key, and you know nothing added to me
No steps, no pageant for me
So tell 'em all I do is rap and serve, like imagine how I serve
You see how I was flowing on my last cd

[Bridge]
Your favorite one
Your favorite one
Your favorite one
Your favorite one

[Verse 3]
The moment you find what you wasn't looking for
But soon as you got it can you never put it back
Built off the juggle I know the worth of a double
Your hands work with the double and you let the money stack
Same rules apply, you see it all up in mine
They're one in the same kind I just handle the react
Do it how you do it I promise you I ain't moving
I knew it before I knew it, I forever wanted that[INTRO: Wale]

This is only for the hip-hop lovers
You want that bullshit - turn the radio on
Skyzoo, Wale

[Verse 1: Wale]

The one and only, homey still Thelonius with it
The only one spittin' like no one else livin'
No one that's breathin' is seen as an equal
Could breathe on the mic and give it epileptic seizures
They turn narcoleptic when them niggas start speakin'
Ridin' in that ES with my Nefertiti queen
And eyes low, pardon me, hah
We smoke the kind of green that turn the Simpsons Bruce Lee on
Hi-Ya, the higher part of my hierarchy
My mind potent like you high off keys or something
Shit, we don't believe none of them
Motherfucker, your career is a conundrum
And none drum, iller than Ninth Wonder
IV, no I can sell like mitochondria
I'm out the country, I'm jet lagging
They can't see me, I'm like the team that brought Brett back
And I'm man-genie, flyer than the rest of them
Wale Ovechkin
Fuckin' with that ice, them Landover niggas check ya
Check one-two, the mic is my weaponry
Lyrically or physically, step to me, you rest in peace
Watch what I do to beats, I don't need no jewelery
I was underground but wasn't trying to renew the lease
Yeah, hello mainstream, I'm a walking dollar bill ain't a damn thing changed

[Verse 2: Skyzoo]

I got mine while the rest of ya'lls was still looking
I'm top five, but no begging, dawg, I for real took it
So how they grilling me is literally just serenity
Literally, if you say you feeling me, then you feel Brooklyn
[Wale: Whatup!]
And I don't do colorful jeans or shiny kicks
My shoe game is Penny in ninety-six
I move aim, hit 'em and final flip
Whether it's a beat or a scam
I gave ya'll wizardry with my hands
I made ya'll want to be what I am
And as far as your fades I raised them all underneath where I stand
I'm pushing it for the corner
Keeping them on the hip
And, yup, I gave lyrics a reason to want to live
Fresh off the plane, Hong Kong, Beijing
Felt like I was home, the groupie love was the same
I'm Kobe in an orange jersey
And wrote this from 4:25 to 4:30, hah

[Wale] Okay

[Skyzoo] Yeah, I mean, I literally wrote that from 4:25 to 4:30

[Wale] That's about five minutes, guy

[Skyzoo] For real
They call me, S-K-Y-Z-O-O

[Verse 3: Wale]

And I'm Wale Folarin, was raised on go-go
They style is so-so, my Louis from So-Ho
Hoping that hip-hop can surface and go-go again
They go major, the flow is no longer
So everything retro come across so corny
Everything from Bradfords to gimmick spitters
To every nigga who rap and say, 'My shit's different!'
So get with us or lose like them niggas
Spent more on these kicks than Pac-Man spent on strippers

Haha! This just the beginning of the, uh, you know, the whole process of this Back to the Feature mixtape
DC whatup?
BK whatup?
PG whatup?
MoCo whatup?

Let me do some shoutouts
Mo betta - what up?
UCB - what up?
Hey Sycamore, whatup?
You ain't' doing shit til you put 10 gees on fantasy football
That's when you know you doing shit
Yeah, bitchI just wanted an Ernie Barnes
Name dropping ain't a problem if it turn you on
Looking for supplies make you ride til the curtain's drawn
Liquor store plans that dwindle down into murder warrants
I'm JJ Evans in a Louis belt
Balmain jeans loose enough to keep a shooter's help
And I swear they keep telling me to remind y'all
That they don't read blogs unless it helps 'em to find y'all
And those is the guys that I call friends
That's looking for thick bitches inside of a small Benz, and me?
Outside of my door was style wars
But behind it was limiteds that covered the house walls, and me?
I'm 50/50 as far as how I was drawn
So whether we in the lobby or black tie the ball
I'm just as good on the first as I am on the last
I grew up knowing the first like I planted the stash
I grew up knowing the worst with my hands on the dash
Of a Rover
I learned French and learned soda
A meeting of the 2, made it easier to move
Conversing with a mirror like I'll leave it up to you
Same as I always did it, what's the wonder for?
Lived up to all your predictions and shook the wonder off
All black walls, the living room will astound you
Covet that wall, it somersaults in value, right?
I just wanted Kadir Nelsons
And when he did paintings for Jeter I clear helped him
You're welcome, now I'm looking at 10 of those
The crib get appraised its a gallery within a home
I wanted Leroy Campbells
His spot was around the corner
My pops spent money on him
The blocks that I was walking
Was black art and black hearts, black bags of black gas was by the stash mark
And now the scene replays
A couple Kenneth Gatewoods
A couple TTKs, go!
Name dropping ain't a problem if it turn you on
Everybody talking Ellis Wilson once they heard the song
On the steps
Watching Biggie in the lex
The same one Nas mentioned
Passenger side Kim and
Growing up tryna mimic
That was us, that a must
Dating rich broads, turned Sports Center, batter up
Google turns rumors to reporters at your door
While your phone going stupid, wrong numbers talking raw, chill!
Thinking I just want a Picasso
Nobody can fade him, 4th member of The Lox flow
PJs in the morn, hard rock suites
10 cases of spade, 6 bottles in each, right?
Really there's nothing I wasn't in for
So to label me a backpacker is an insult, right!
Told 'em I just wanted it all
All black walls, I did it just how you thought, muhfuckers

[Hook]
All black walls, all green pockets
Ain't nobody complaining cause can't nobody stop it, nah
The living room will astound you
Covet that wall, it somersaults in value[Hook]
All day, always
All of us is for it
Ain't a song change
All the shit we saw is what we all became
And we all that we got 'long as the song plays

[Verse]
We hung out in front of the corner store
Got older and took it to the liquor store
Money low, so bet we wanted more
Only way we'll separate is how we pick the course

Like who you with every day, leave them ni**as over there
What?, damn, I feel funny even saying that
That word is foreign and my friends could never make me that
Duly noted if needed but know it never will
Easy to adapt when you around whatever's realThe allure of just saying no more
Like I done said the most and if you waited too long
Then that's you, that's on you and the time that's in the air
But if you need what it be the rewind button is there
I tried rushing you here but you was kinda content
And now shit's getting thick and its you that's climbing the fence
I did it from day one, I never took off a night
I never shook off the light, in the midst of a great run
I told you what I was on and showed you double or nothing
The ones who really heard are the ones who cut the discussion
Like "nah, Sky got it, there's nothing for him to prove
If he ever laced 'em up you'd be running outta ya shoes"
You being whoever,the name of them doesn't matter
They know I'm not for play, I'm raising them up as rappers
But the anger and the sorrow mixed up leads to mistrust
And then it gets tough to say I'm a fucking rapper
2 for 2 with the classics and got a 3rd coming
And I ain't drop one verse that didn't earth something
Even the throw always was shit you would go to play
And say that the only thing beside it that you kno is jay
The day ones, all of them know how me do
I'm pretty much Earl Manigault but no needles
So when you talking Kareem or Wilt or Connie Hawk
Remember who they was modeling when they stepped on the court
Stand for the city?, I done stood forever
Every record was Brooklyn bridge overlooking together
Every record was Southside or the X or Harlem
Or the islands, I was about 'em so I'm begging your pardon
But lets say I went and did it, brought him straight to the work
And at the end was an arrow to point him straight to a hearse
Would the power circle of the city stand tall
And recognize the real and how they handle support?
Doubt it, and I can jump for the bait that he leaves
I'm NY to the death when they was changing they teams
But they opened up the doors for him to say what he please
It don't help that the real king went and gave him the keys
Doing verses on a remix, shit why wouldn't he think he's it?
I would think the same with all them reach ins
Not a shot it's a drop of honesty
And if I pour the whole glass that's more that you gotta clean
So I'll leave it there and you know where I stand
Talking music for my friends and one love to my fans
So I'll leave it there and you know where I stand
Talking music for my friends and one love to my fans

Hook:
If you're with us along the way
Then act like you was with us along the way
(2x)[Verse 1]
It's yours, the likes of which that you had never seen
Do it how you knew it, the influence never leaves
Your inhibition is kicking while they shooting up a scene
Come and do it to your pocket while they do it to their sleeve
Said to do what you believe, well we believe in more amounts
More around, more to find, more top cop, more to count
On it now, borderline mortified, stalling out
Take a leap of faith and lead the way into a smaller town
Town business like you found business when you brought it down
Borderline til a 745's brought around
And you 'round it forever whether you know it or stay away
You mount up together knowing you throwing a stray away
Thrown in a position to be lifted from a day away
Drumming like your heart beat, numb to what the song be
Thrown in a position to be with it if you want piece
Whether you agreed you denied, doe or die

[Hook]
Cause you gonn ask Bodie for a package, believe that
And everything will be the way it should be on the feedback
Hands up over fists' when it's clicking, you see that?
Point out what you want and it's yours
Cause you gonn ask Bodie for a package, believe that
And everything will be the way it should be on the feedback
Hands up over fists' when it's clicking, you see that?
Point out what you want and it's yours

[Verse 2]
It's yours, the likes of which that you already knew 'bout
Decisiveness is everything in shoot outs
The ills of the wills when the chill don't exist
And the risks become more than the rewards that they threw out
Paint the town mint green, the intrigue stays at the front
Same story illustrated from the jump, you know the wagers that they want
But retro's is a weekly occurrence
And I'm in mine now so my deterrence, is flourished
In irony, like either make a poem or make a zone
Become a flight and do what you wish you could do and make it home
'til they teach you bout a throne and the leather that the seat on
Is from the same couch you got your feet on
Shit is more or less until the rest become a seance, you see on?
Grew up idolizing like "if Jay on, then we on"
Thrown in a position to be with it if you want piece
Whether you agreed you denied, doe or die

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Skarr Akbar]
It's yours, the product of the environment you've confided in
Pressure bends knees like the side effects of klonopins
You deep inside the sea of the streets, look for leviathans
The beast pray on the weak, no repeats and no try agains
Silence, talk less and do more
No time to ask "who is it?" when knockers knock at your door
Put yourself in a position to listen
Or be a victim
Or another bad static of a tale in Baltimore
When summer falls, we spring into the winter
Recruit 'em at front and center
Move product with new beginners
So the package that we lend ya
Out of respect for ya father
Jell it all and have the money by tomorrow
Just do it how they taught ya
And everything will work if you believe that
Be careful, and watch for the feedback, you see that?
Thrown in the position to be with it if you want piece
Whether you agreed or denied
Doe or die[Verse 1 Buckshot]
I'm a hit you a strike
I'm a spit you the mic
I'm the real, UGH, you a sike
I'm the only one who get it done and do it right
See each and every night I got a plot for another plan, Buckshot
Nobody can rock like this brother man
Other than you being my friend? YOU A FOE!
I'mma be the wind in the end I'mma blow
I ain't never been a square cuz' I think outside the box
Fifteen years my partner is Dru-Ha
Listen I'm on a mission this is my Tom to Cruise
This is not a movie this is real life moves
I don't wear sneakers to sneak I wear shoes
I mean shows I wear them out when I walk on tour
I never got booed because I don't believe in ghosts
I believe in being successful achieving the most you know?

[Hook]
I'm better than you
No matter what you do man I'm better than you
You good at what you do but I'm better than you
No matter where you come through I prove I'm better than you
Listen the bottom line I'm better (I'm better) I'm better (I'm better) I'm better
I don't care if it's a solo or if it's a crew
Listen to what I'm saying I'm better than you

[Hook]

[Skyzoo]
You know I'mma win, cuz I'm the one
And I don't slip, cuz I don't run
I'm off the hip, until it's sprung
I foresee the win, told you that I'm the one
And whether you spellin' it with the O-M-W at the top
I leveled it from the go, I'm with double-do on the knot
If I'm coming through on the hop, you adjust to the back
Winner's circle all alone, I'm accustomed to that
Uno Breed and you know me and what this ink do
September 29th is your date due
Homie, regardless what city I'm in, I'mma sell those shirts
And I do this through the pressure like my elbow hurts
King me, provide you, if your memories beside you
Then they pigeon to skyzoo, for kickin' that monsoon
My home team is the logo the greatest created
Great ace while I'm shakin' the pavement jumpman you get it?

[Hook]

[Promise]
They stuntin' so I pose like I sold out my shows
You call in, I'm called to do what I do I'mma do it til I'm old, I'm better
More clever with the letters and you know that
I'm better than whoever's embedded up on your throwback
I'm better I promise
Check out how I prove it
Goin' off on tracks and makin' better sounding music
So when I create rhymes, rewind and take time
I'm Bryant when I ride the baseline
"Is Promise THAT live?"
He's probably that guy to rhyme and revive the Fab Five, I can't lie
I'm part Canadian so I'm cold
But I'm part Caribbean so I'm told
When I go in on tracks I Bolt
Cuz' I'm from the home of the Raps' and Skydome I know

[Hook]

[Sean Price]
(Yeah, P)
You can say what you want but I'm better than y'all
Line em' up watch how fast my competitors fall
Sean Price, upper echelone rap
You kiddin' me, get rid of me? That's never gon' happen
Excellence my performance is outstandin'
Your negligence leave you out in the cold stranded
Arms and hugs, baby the boy fly
When I kick raps lyrically I am Muay Thai
OMG, lol smiley face pardon tkcp
MJ in his prime, I am king
All star rappin' for real on this hip hop scene
Yeah, I guess I'm the best at it
Let you score on purpose so the lost'll be less tragic
How I do when I don't have a clue but I do know this part
I am better than you

[Hook][Verse 1: Skzyoo]
Trying to be a Huxtable but predestined to be a Evans, see what luck can do?
If we was ever to see an exit, keep it wonderful
And leave out on good terms if it come to you
For what it does to you or if its worth it there
Charge it all to the game and leave your purchase there
Cause all we wanted was lanes so if we turning there
Know that we drove for as long as we could
Misunderstandings when all of us were so understood
Putting hands in, trying to get a hold of some goods
I mean, Nelly called is mother and told her quit her job
Fuck a 16, that shit was as real as God
And as I watched that diary on Cornell
I became a fan for how he changed the doorbell
Buzzers get replaced so fuck you feel away
I'm just trying to do that all so give me love or give me lane

[Hook: Skyzoo] (x2)
Be Well (x4)
I just hope you be well
Well enough to know where we at
One of one, and I just hope you see that
And I just hope you
Be Well (x4)
I just hope you be well
Well enough to know who we are
We were dreaming long enough now that sleep shit is gone
So be well

[Verse 2: Skzyoo]
Introspective street rap I birthed that
I carried that flag when y'all were trying to 'herse that
Now this shit is moving and its proving that you can work that
Do remember where they learned that
Hope you be well
Well enough to know the dope from the jail
And the shit they try to give you when they throw you a cell
Cause all I ever tried to give you was all pure
I ain't gon' step on anything it was all yours
I was trying to paint a couple pictures in the living room
Using cardboard as a canvas like 'this will do'
And if I bid adieu
And these is worth something
And let my mother make a sell, so she could purch' something
And let my pops keep his favorite out the catalog
And if my block get to spraying, I ain't mad at all
Salute something, word to black Jesus on the wall
If not, then you won't see us anymore and I just hope you Be Well

[Hook] (x2)[Verse 1:]

In my uniform Starter jacket cape as old as my little brother
I came through that gate like no similar others
My brother 22 if that line went over you
You open up the trunk and you'll find where I through the stu'
I'm probably known to you
As 90% better
And neck and neck with the 10 that you covet but it's whatever
Whatever shoulda been said will be said when they start sayin'
Why they said it's over wet with the best of the bar cadence
But hey
We good though
As long as my hood know
And my hood in the loop like the part where the hooks go
The heart of a crook though
I see the facade
I do it for the Yout Dem like Onika Miraj
All I need is a charge
And a lane to be y'alls
But until it
I play the bullets that'll race through ya car
Until it
I sit and pull it if you breakin' they heart
And then you playin' dodge tryin to get away in ya Dodge
Double meaning
Want it and wanna be it
For the logo
And know yo that nothin' will between it
On the low though
I hand em' the real and call it even
For the dough yo
I plan to Darrelle
I'm on my Revis
Need us
We right there
Pronto wit it
I mean you ride for that ride
Play the Bronco wit it
Tell em spell it backwards and give us Harpo digits
And the broads from Tiatro to bring us Mambo chicken
D.C. waddup
Howard homecomings
Dope jumpin'
Flow feel like if ya throat runnin'
No dumbing
Did for mine from side to side
I'm to Brooklyn what Penny was to Memphis in '95
A walking Lyricists Lounge
All of this is the now
Meaning by tomorrow I bury this in the ground
Given the grammar in here I see we're unfamiliar
Shit is a family affair and we deeper than The Sylvers
I never had the back of my neck under nobody arm
Nobody helped I ain't here from nobody palm
Word to the critics and the women who tagged em'
My life is XL ratings and XL Magnums
In the spirits two Margarita shots
Pardon me but I been hot
Arguably I'm at the top
Part of me is for the block
Part of me is for the guap
All of me is what you cop
Carter me like it's The Roc
14 wit a flow
I was underneath the block
Thought Jadakiss was Jesus I just wanted to be The Lox
Fast forward to the now
Can't a soul see the jot
Or the scribe or the brushes or whatever I should drop
Mawfuckas can't touch em' you oven mitten the burners
While they callin' me the top three of the Brooklyn worders
Like
Big, Jay &; S-K
I give away the left lane
Anyone who feels differently you tell em' press play
"Great Debater" took 30 days to come up with
Sean Price said "It sound like you mad and Sky, I love it"
Fuck it
Penny Series
The first time did it
Otis Redding was resurrected when I work my pennin'
I'm just honestly approaching it
If I be over throwing it
The ladders by the tree for the Frisbee's that you can go and get
So you can go and get em' and...

Damn what happened to the beat?
(Yo that's the end of the beat)
Word?
Well fuck it
Penny Series
Black Hero Music
Week 3
Yea
And by the way that Black Milk beat is one of my favorite beats ever
So that's why it got tagged
Black waddup
Call me S-K-Y-Z-O-O
Yea[Intro:]

Back at it
Back where it started at
You know it started with me just taggin' people beats
Puttin' my twist and doin what I do
Frisbee this & Frisbee that
Throwin' a couple here and there
Take it back to it
Yea
Rest in peace Otis Redding
Okay
Yea
Okay
Okay

[Verse 1:] Skyzoo

Sittin' on the dock of the bay like I was placing orders
Phones turned off I ain't taking callers
They say when I rap
They expect sun moon and stars
To jump through the car
But I'm just trying to paint a corner
Make it four of those
Let me box something
Too big for the Porsche the chicken box coming
Grew up on Kennedy Fried you smell the box hummin'
I'm 3 piece on the beat
Like where ya box youngin'

Range Rover rhythm
Rubber band signature
I don't do it for me
I do it for the liquor store
I'm as true as it be
Truthfully on this accord
Parkour through the door
I'm just trynna get across
Rosary bead rap
I'm just trynna get a cross
Know that the feedback
Is all that they was living for
Livin' Proof like I made it outta Group Home
Ambition for the broads that be two tone

Up to bat but I don't see no pitches
So I leave it and get back to baggin' Theo sister
Like leave Olivia home
Unless Olivia knows
Then fuck it
You can bring her now Olivia grown
Call it fly guy etiquette
Ride by reppin' it
Cocktail rappers get a Molotov sedative
While you waved in on the wade wit no patience
Butterscotch hooked on a broad welcome to raisins
The Frisbee's have never been higher
Screamin' catch it if you can off the head of Goliath
They thinkin' I was from Harlem
Forever Goliath
My fitted over my brow
M. Betha attire
But I'm from

The same background you see in my videos
I shot em' all on my block
Brought you in my home
Leave ya man where he at they might want em'
Cause he don't the stomach to hustle like Strike Dunham
And me
I'm from where we would open the fire hydrant
And put a can in the front it while we hidin' behind it
But seein' the speed of money will make you leave from the hydrant
And wanna be in the car that they respect and keep it dry
I can't
Change who I be
Not in the least bit
I'm here for the Jay money floor seat shit
I'm here for the Ye money and a sweet bitch
And inside my phones already an elite mix

So now I need the paper
The broads already been there
And none of em' is leavin' unless its to buy swim wear
Automatically I was givin' a top 10 chair
Or better yet took it
Waited til they was lookin'
And Debo'd whatever
Rewrote the headers
The top is never safe so I reload forever
Throne visions and loops of Otis Redding
Sittin' on the the dock of the bay
Boat Check In

And I would've did a hook
But Illmind said fuck it don't put no hook on it
The bars is more than enough
Call me S-K-Y-Z-O-O
S-K-Y-Z-O-O

Throne visions and loops of Otis Redding
Sittin' on the the dock of the bay
Boat Check In[Intro - Skyzoo - talking] (Sample)
(Got to change)
(I know, I know, I know, I know, I know it)
Yeah, I know it to
(Yeah, it's got to change)
It do got to change, don't it?
(Ew baby), ha, let me do it for them
(Yeah, it's got to change)
Yo, woo!

[Verse 1 - Skyzoo]
I'm twenty-five but a vet in the game
And yeah I'm, super fly but from the 'jects all the same
And yeah I'm, true to mine so when the rest of 'em hate
I feel I'm, doin fine or they'd have less they could say
I mean, I dos me, embody what cool be
You hollerin who's me? I'm product on loose leafs
I body the loose leaf, you gotta excuse me
I jumped out of that hooptie and inside of that new lean
American dreamin, I'm part of that other suite
Any means necessary, the bottom'll cover me
I got 'em in love with me, knowin that tomorrow isn't promised
I'm a get it and then get me some more after I got it
Yeah I'm with it, I made it from the curb
But kept the pen the same cause they relate to all the words
So now that I'm the first up to bat and I can read what they be throwin
Tryin to curve it is a wrap, you can see just where it's goin

[Hook - Skyzoo] - 2X - w/ ad libs
The bottom line is, line is
Gettin it is nothin when you grindin, grindin
Gettin it is nothin when you grindin, grindin
Picture perfect with it when I'm grindin, grindin
That's the bottom line

[Verse 2 - Skyzoo]
Uh, another day, another dollar
Get enough of 'em and ain't no way they ain't gonna follow
So you follow my lead like the two of the three type
The one's that is on the fence is on the bench cause he don't breathe right
Too out of your league, right?
Cool, I understand, I'm varsity pushin it
Move like I'm runnin scams and dogs from the looks of it
You be on your stand still, I be on my no doz
And when you got your hands peeled, I be on my dolo
And I'm celebratin for those that ain't get to make it
I guess I'm makin it for 'em
And everyone who was waitin, I'm throwin greatness upon 'em
Everyone who was hatin, I so embraced your performance
That I'm callin for an encore, encore
Level wise, I'm somethin like level nine
And it's a different air up here, I get a better high
Definition of one of one and when it come to one
I be that, so findin that is a one and done

[Hook] - w/ ad libs

[Verse 3 - Skyzoo]
Uh, picture perfect with it, right? Snap shot ability
Show you how to grind, got a back block agility
Money on my mind, yeah I'm back where the scrilla be
And as far as my shine, well my back's where the ceiling be
Closer to the sky, so with that you could riddle me
I'm literally the only one as ill as me, you feeling me?
Backpackers wanna confuse it
Cause dudes is icy, that don't got nothin to do with the music

[Hook] - w/ ad libs

[Outro - Skyzoo - talking]
Uh, the bottom line is, line is
Yeah, the bottom line is, line is
S-K-Y-Z-O-O
Yeah, Eric G got beats
Uh, woo!
(Eww, yeah)[Verse 1: Skyzoo]
By any means, my enemy is in plenty reach
So if the need is get 'em leant to get a lead
Then shit'll lean, like literally, hit 'em clean
Until they clean off the mirror, like "shit is me"
And then I'm trying to regroup thoughts
All these plans I was making to get me moved off
And didn't know it, right
Now that I know it right
I'm ducking cameras on the corner trying to blow the lights
Blowing lights, car covered in scars, cutting the smog
And the smoke screens under the stars, what a facade
When the smoke seems up and beyond I bust a U-ey
I'm Old School, all of my slang is that truly
Pardon me if I'm different
Part of me's reminiscing
And part of me's 20/20
So part of me wouldn't miss it
Part of me's Montclair and part is Nautica sweats
Part of me's by the stairs, and part of me's on a jet
But all of me's the embodiment of a Yankee fitted
The only one who was riding up with a Yankee in it
Fuck it though, chalk it up to the rap
Nobody introduced me to Nia so now I'm back
Like, can it all be so simple now? Can it be?
When everyone that you a fan of is a fan of me?
I use that to try to see what just this fandom be
And if it don't go as planned, then I just plan to leave
Leave before it turns and they swear it didn't
By any means you saw the difference
Raised as a witness like Jill Scott and the Jacksons
But born the day before Christmas oh shit I'm probably backwards
I'm living out of a wrapper
Gold ones to be honest
With big XLs all over them if you jocking
Just being honest, something nobody ever is
Relevant problems because the problem is relevance
Invincible in the memo section
Mo'erfuckers shoulder reading, trying to get a reflection
By any means
I'm trying to make it all make sense
Or talk money on the beat so we can all pay rent

[Verse 2: Open]
Playing Cody Chesnutt the theme song
Nothing but an open heart for me to lean on
Trying to get my green grown
Children singing out to the high heavens
Lord please help us help us not to be clones
Wherever we roam
I feel the load weigh heavily telling them reload
I just want peace though
Peace within us are in
Peace from within shines brighter than the stars
And the cars and the shards of the jewel
And the bezel, the tools to dishevel
The views of the youth that are used as a vessel
To tell the truth, I used to dream of it too
But tell me, what's an honest Commie to do?
I mean the obvious route
Stack it up to give it back and what not
Instead of stack to get a pad with a yacht
By any means, I'm trying to feed my people
Need to do or you die
Until I'm in the zoo in the sky
Almighty Open am I

[Hook: Skzyoo]
By any means, my enemy was in plenty reach
Tried to passenger seat it and balance him and me
Shit ain't working so now I'm trying to get where he be
And Subzero that mo'erfucker within his sleep
Looking down at a mirror where his pillow be
Reached for him and got to it to keep him sleep
No hustle involved, but I was beating me
Know the hustle involved if should you see him leave
Know we run to the stars whenever we in reach
How they come through in cars that we don't seem to see[Verse 1]
Alife hoodies for when the wind move
A lifestyle like no other how you want it
When you jumping out your covers then you cover what you're into
And pray to whoever you praise that you live through
Living for the light til the light becomes a signal
And signals to you as the one to empty a clip to
Then it turns round like the signals on the dial
And the lights hop up outta nowhere like they the cymbals
Cue 'em, and watch 'em get to moving like a heart rate
Looking for a dimmer, get to cooking all winter
And you looking more Blizzard and this turns into a bar raid
"aight everybody, strip and get your your arms raised!"
Check day jumping, chest plate thumping
Freestyle to it, don't a neck brace want it
Soundtrack to the shooter, the soundtrack to it
The background music how the background do us
For the civilized leisure

[Hook]
This leisure needs to be civilized
Gotta have it, its already mine
Its already ours, its already ours

[Verse 2]
And it appears, the scent is in the air
The smell of Rosè and a nickel plated glare
The bezè rotates while the middle make 'em stare
Heavy on the bass, let it kick away your fears
Heavy on the bass like the symbolism there
There like a cling on, fear like the ring on
That's left to the left of the fears that you swing on
Fall up outta pocket like the cymbal isn't there
Cue 'em, and let 'em find lane like the plug
And it u­turns to a pillow case and a rug
And the truth turns to the middle lane being plugged
And you dealing with the outskirts, spilling like a outburst
The doors shut and they forget to let you out first
The trap literally jumping and you stuck in
Being everything you saw when you wanted even more
And you think of how the lights wasn't bright enough at all
For the civilized leisure

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
They say "Sky your story don't ever change up"
It never will, it's everything that I say it was
Forever will be centered on how we came up
On Tryna be in the center of where the cake be
They told us keep it the same and if the cake leave
Make the loyalty stay and let your name breathe
May whoever's beside me have the same speed
Civilized where the leisure can take me
Civilized leisure[Intro] [DJ Premier talking]
Yo, turn the lights on. I can't see in here
I gotta see what's goin' on man. You hear me? (Commissioner)
Turn the lights on (The League Crew). Word. Click
Uh huh. Yeah, bring the horns. Word up. Here's another one
The lights is on. How we say that shit? Do it now +Git It Done+
Ha ha. Yeah. Skyzoo. Torae. Click

[Verse One] [Torae]
I said the more often I rhyme the more awkward you find it
To be accepted by the lyrical minded
Individual, subliminal, criminal conscious
Makin' me numb how I'm stealin' the shine is
Defined as stupendous
Torae spittin' with splendedness
So my sentence is like a syllabus to the listeners
+Git It Done+, got it done
Got 'em a lot of runs
We plotted on how to double back with a hotter one
Nigga I'm New York ground
Been holdin' New York down
With the creator of the New York sound
And there can never be another or a new version of nothin'
Niggas must of forgot where it started
Primo they buggin'
It's more of the future, less of what you used ta
Whoever feel hip hop is dead, here's a booster
With no cables or battery pack
So everybody lovin' the city, we glad that we back
You should sit down and listen to what the game's been missin'
Cause +Reprogram+ was my +Redefinition+
I guess Chairman's Choice was just the beginnin'
Cause I'm the one to XXL for every sentence
I read every blog, every article printed
I heard every bar, every rhyme you was pennin'
I felt all the hate and the love
You niggas fake as a fuck
You want my spot nigga? Take it in blood

[Scratch Hook]
"That's why I write the shit that I write in my rap
Everyday of the week I live in it, breathe in it" dead prez 'Police State'
"It is senseless for you to prevent this" - Obie Trice 'Drama Setter'
I know you wanna enter but I can't let you in" - Buckshot 'Crooklyn'

[Verse Two] [Skyzoo]
The second coming of the shit that you fear
The first time they was callin' it luck
But low and behold I'm still in ya ear
See the difference is here
So keep that in your mind
When you rhymin' and you thinkin' bout leanin' on lyin'
Scrap whatever you thought and what you wanted to think
I attack your spot the minute that you fuck up and blink
Motivated by a Kennedy fry tropical fantasies
7-1-8, Chris Wallace and James Yancy
S-K, the prodigal son chosen
Lyrical landmark, father with the flows is
So youngin' don't confuse me with nothin' them dudes be
My leap year is outta your dude's reach
Skyzoo change for change?
Hardly
Meanin' I'm signin' my contract with a Sharpie
Motherfuckers is buggin' if they want me to beg
I'll be creepin' on a come up like ?
Deal with it
And through all that, I'm still with it
The beat is still sluttin' so yeah, I still dick it
Huh, it's clear as day but y'all don't see it ock
I guess I'm like a lost episode of Graffiti Rock
Or somethin' like the wax that the record is made from
They need me more than they say son
Okay Player?
So you can type whatever you want to type
But I still write better than everyone that you like

[Scratch Hook]

They give me the same flack they gave Gloria son
Either or James or Carter, but both of them won
So either or take it to heart or eat all that you want
I made more reaching from y’all than hoping you sprung
The same door that he was in front of and wanted to rush
Is now leased in his name, did he come up or what
Strange' are in order, hallways did it for him?
Inspired to get it by him, Parkay of the talkers
Shit is butter like Big was still here on another life
I walk by them steps everyday, so now who wanna write?
Back like running lights and Po’ now follow
And that armrest is locked, so someone get the swallowing
If y’all blessed to watch, then someone get the honoring
On it like I’m towering, acknowledge my acknowledgment
Still means just what it says
So if you got it then consider you in the echelon of those hollerin’
Great Debater, made it the give and go
Kick fly talk and slide off, I’m Henry Lowe
Call it Complicated Rhythm
Cause as far as how they listening
They get it but don’t get it and I don’t bother what they missin’
If they missed it, no difference
Know them martyrs get dismissed
So it’s snowing all roses and the thorns is in the wind
And if you caught one in the end
You was drawn to it again
You clicked on the ZShare, you just bought you a syringe
This shit is in reach where they got to bargain to get in
So give him the scene there, they’ll be nodding off again
Now I pardoned it again, I was pardon off of wonders
And I Drew it like I play point guard for the Thunder
So all of what it leads to, started off the EQ
Wasn’t Dwyane Wade but I was on my Jordan 3 move
Wasn’t Dwayne Wayne but had a broad like Keanu
And jealous bitches called her “kee low-low”, I see you HA!

Hook x2:
For my complicated rhythm, took muthafuckas about as far as it could get ‘em
Look at how they love it when it’s on in the system
One shot, caught ‘em in the rhythm
I took ‘em like there like…[Produced by Fatin]

[Verse 1]
If you can hear my stroll it'll sound like the snare on a roll
But I'm too cool to walk so my Cadillac hog
Get to gripping the corner and I'll be gone before you clear me to go
It'll be me, myself, and my Saturday night special
In a sea full of needles and habits that might bless you
I shape my fro and get back to the usual
Shit is Russian Roulette if I'm clappin' up through the crowd
Accurate with the *BLAOW* so fear no strays
Say, I aim where I aim on how I hear your rage
Vigilante, bred through dice games and tray bags
And cleaned up like the first day back
Tell 'em it's the D-Y-N-A-M-I-T
E on the closure, usually where the hoes were
Loose their furs like they loose they composure
And bring snow hills for the roof of where their nose was

[Hook]
Muthafucka I'm cool de la
Jive turkeys couldn't hurt me, but do they try
Tryna murk me on the early, but I'm too on time
I don't worry, I just move on by
Said, I'm cool de la

[Verse 2]
Wood grain whip appeal
You catch me and Bullhorn where all the bitches build
Secondary though, first up is hit the steel
Warehouse clears out right before the shipment peels
Another take down, hear they wanna get me killed
They're low until they get to me and then it get for real
They know that if it get to me I'm 38in' it
Hold these for trying to get away with it
Police is trying to get paid from it
That's paper bag money
But Cream Corn will get the scoop and lay the rap on me
Perhaps they was tryna trap on me
So Honey Bee is tryna clap for me
She get her Pam Grier on, hands clear on the stance we're on
And we got eyes all around us, so you can't stare long
Ha, right back like it never left us
I blow the spot and leave out of here with Thelma Evans
Dynamite

[Hook]
Muthafucka I'm cool de la
Jive turkeys couldn't hurt me, but do they try
Tryna murk me on the early, but I'm too on time
I don't worry, I just move on by
Said, I'm cool de la

[Outro]

Know what it is when I walk in there with it
You might know me as S-K-Y-Z-O-O, S-K-Y-Z-O-O
But call me Black Dynamite[Verse 1]

Killin' your idols one word at a time
When I was killin y'alls, I was also murderin' mine
Indeed I'm all it be, I squeeze accordingly
If a fave should get caught in between then all it means
Is meaning was never enough for me to wanna wish through
Fists full of dollars, ignorance is so blissful
Every part of me just wanna see how much the fists do
If this be a problem then I'm missing all the signals
You could miss me with the mistakes
Cause my realities is the meaning of missed plates
Kitchen tables need decorating, I'm decorated
The china be there but all the feelings is misplaced
And this may lead to a decay of beautiful sorts
If I could race through all the traits and the beautiful Porsche
Then I'll erase through the change they refuse to restore
And pitfalls in the poetry, truthfully yours
And monologues at a dollar store, invited to ride along
Parental advisory, all of it is how you thought
All that we In Search Of is to Fly Or Die
So to have you Seeing Sounds that's inside the Sky
Is Nothing I suppose, so if I was alone
Then them sounds that you seeing is all that I really know

[Hook]

For the all in the mall
And the rush to follow
That buck that bought a bottle
Could've struck the lotto
Say I'm on what I'm on trying to jump tomorrow
And I bought that boy a bottle
Could've struck the lotto, honestly

[Verse 2]
So that's 300 tickets that we could be comin' in with
That spade shit is pricey but we in love with the livin'
We in love with the life, lust, the pursuit
Promise not to forget how to adjust to the stoop
But if I'm away from whatever is made from
Know that I betrayed none, forever remained one
Forever embedded in the better of days come
The header on page one, my sketch is a ? run
Tootin' my own horn'll level the page some
And then the level gets lowered and I refrain from
Pennin' what the norm does, everything the norm was
Should've been the past but the future's like the norm's son
Tryna plan B that, pills in the sauce
Hope they smart enough to eat that and dumb enough to starve
So to summarize it all, this is more than what it seems
Fully loaded clouds, corner of your dreams
It's nothing I suppose, so if I was alone
Then them sounds that you seeing is all that I really know

[Repeat Hook]Tryna be counting until it hurts tho
Hash tag we keeping the money first flow
You work slow then you last as far as firsts go
Ivy league street raps I sorta birthed those
Never stepped foot on a step without my steps
Being in some sneakers that made you need to rewind yep
I was 18 in the dorms, getting pictures drawn
By the art majors of chains that I was spending on
Week later had that chain, went and hit the halls
Put it on your wiz while I tagged, I would christen broads
The perils of being young
Stair case wit a stripper I let her be who she want
Rewind to how I grew up, fast forward my new up
Caught in between corner dreams and hallelujahs
Waking up wit visions of credit card schemes
And then buying art with 'em off whoever lost these
The irony thats in that, where obviously I'm backed
By some guys that don't get it but got me if shit is packed
Shit changed, shit didn't
Show money on denim
The upscale vandals, the jeans they been Visvim
We was bound to be around what we around
So we roped off the circle from squares to keep 'em out
Spilling Spade on cool Greys
To your broad I'm Nas, to moms I'm Cool J
To your squad I'm the God, a product of two a days
And the closest to Shawn since the moment you knew Jay
At least that's what they put in their tweets
As well as the voices in front when I look up street
Said if we treat the last like it's the first
Only problem that we'll have is counting until it hurts
I mean, said if we treat the last like it's the first, only problem that we'll have is counting until it hurts[Verse 1 - Skyzoo]
The life of Kings and everything we call it
The realization of everything that we forfeit
The last scene of the night, with no applaudin
Tryin to circle back to when the curtains were called in
I talk to you, cause you told me to throw my all in
And now it feels like I'm too far in
Told me regardless, as long as I could show you where the heart is
Another day shouldn't be a problem
But now the more I come to you, the more it feel like, real life
Couldn't of been built right, you told me to still write
Said that you would help me make sense of it all
And we would never have to censor our talks
So I told you everything, I never worried about if you could hear
I assumed your attention was a sign of how you cared
See with you, I was different, I ain't try to hide fear
Nor anger, nor excitement
Played you my life as, quick as I was livin it
Gave you my life as, quick as I could give you it
And never had a second thought
Hopin is for the better and forever more
I put you in front of everyone around me
From the first moment that you found me
BFF, I fell for it, by far I fell
And you was the help for it that I would call myself
So if your ears are off or tainted in the least
Then how can I explain this to me?

[Hook - Skyzoo]
So now I'm like - dear whoever
When I put this together
I felt like severin ties, may work better
I felt like steppin aside, instead of together
Could be the best thing for the both of us, forever

Dear whoever
When I put this together
I felt like severin ties, may work better
I felt like steppin aside, instead of together
Could be the best thing for the both of us, forever
Forever, forever

[Verse 2 - Skyzoo]
In all honesty, plannin on how to leave
Is just more proof of the fact that I'm all out of me
Just more truth that exactly the way I tried to be
Was either too much or not enough
No middle ground, so to talk to you and pen it down
Is not as easy no more, I think different now
The idea of tellin you what I wouldn't repeat
Only for you to be wrong is what I couldn't believe
Ran to you anytime I was lookin for me
And I took your advice on how to carry it
No barriers, no doubtin you
Until doubt was the only thing I knew how to do
When the doors close on me, day ones fold on me
You would get a hold of me and tell me to word it
But shit is gettin old on me, shit is monotone homie
Same metronome homie, I already heard it
Same metronome homie, I already heard it
Feelin like everyone before me who support me
Is deservin of a reason to applaud me
And if I ain't able to give 'em that much
Due to how we matched up
I could of scripted out a different story
I threw all caution to the wind, when you told me it was worth it
And pictured that the picture would be perfect
At the end of the day, dear notebook, thanks for all the listens
But we should probably both stop pretendin

[Hook]

[Outro - Skyzoo - talking]
Dear whoever, dear whoever, dear whoever
When I put this together
Felt like severin ties, may work better
Felt like steppin aside, instead of together
Be the best thing for the both of us, forever[Hook:Skyzoo]x2
Okay, this is like designer drugs
Say this shit is like a given how they lining up
Bottom of the pocket baby right where you be finding us
You find that when you rewinding us
[Verse 1:Skyzoo]
Okay, this is like designer drugs
Hook em off the leak
Got em tripping like they finding love
Look for all you need
I was listening to how they pump
Push that off and leave
That's my interest baby line them up
This shit got me right above echelon gated
I was different than expected so
I helped them along the way and
They was itching for an exit and I helped them on the way
And the top said they could eye it
They ain't guess I have to weigh it
Said they knew like that initially
Skeptical to christen me
Know I'm Kemba fitted and the letters with a difference beat
Know I'm Kemba fitted and the letters with a difference beat
Said it twice so maybe on the second you could picture me
Perfectly aligned on the dolo
The singular
Trying to rub shoulders but they shoulders by my knees
I was shouldering a lead on the dolo
The singular
Posted by the stall
What you need?
You load up on your sleeve on the low like
[Hook]x2
[Verse 2: Skyzoo]
Yeah, okay the sauna wants to be next
Saw that truthfully
Ya'll ain't blind enough to see yet
So all it do for me
Is it put me on the left
Well they looked at what was left and then desribed me in the leadest
But I'm just trying to G this
From pitching how they couldn't
Get this like I'm Gooden
And you get it like you couldn't
And if they understood it then they right where they should be
And a mountain full of words
It'd be right where they should ski
And you sneeze when it's blessing you
See how much the letters do
Written on your clothes how we seeing all that residue
Sentence round ya nose pardon me for going honest
I call it like I see it when I see it sprinkled on her
I did it once
Did it twice
I ain't have to twin it, right?
I decided to
So providing you was living hype
Did it just as I predicted
Standing in them lights
Got that off to you
What his penning like?
Load up on your sleeve on the low like
[Hook]x2[Intro]
Yes… Ladies & Gentleman.. welcome to the corner of notion & 9th, the next movement family installment…
Fresh off the World Domi-Notion & Soul Movement 3… im bout to keep it movin right now… making one project at a time people…
Dont rush me…
Yo yo…

[Verse 1]
Yo, There's nothing like writin' ya self
Like a nice little poem with 9th, in-sight of a flip
All wonderful tunes, to enlighten ya health
Yet another brilliant mixtape, another kind I designed to rip
Im not rushin' you, you movin' with the most urgent of haste
With a look like, you just swallowed detergent on ya face
Im not listenin', _& barely concerin' what you say
& im earnin' what im paid, I deserve these accolades,(8)
Slow after I burn one, rush, then flow strongly
Attack with aggression, yet I express it, so calmly
& im on some next shit, so Im getting love again
From Wake ya daughter up, to Kevin Nottingham
& as we travel round the lands, uh, its feelin' amazin'
From mainstream love, to college radio stations
From It's My Turn, to the Domi-NoTiOn of the globe
Its like im spinnin' on the Gravatron, outta control
On this edition you'll hear mad anthem's
You'll hear 9th's drums throwin' real bad tantrum's
Damn son! the medium is class, & got the speakers on smash
FAR from that Cam' shit with the Blam Blamers.. so you, know.. (20)
You know..

[Hook]
...I'm on the right path
In a robe, after a niccce blunt & a bath
I know.. I-I know I got the right swag
I blow it in they face & laugh
Go home & figure, re-frame ya shit
You all off the picture
So ugly like the body of Scharzenegger
So figure its just time to leave
Dont rush mE, let mE blaze, time to breathe
So dont rush me...

I know im on the right path
I know this shit will last
Dont Rush Me it's a..
Long road, & we comin thru fast
With the Movement Fam' at last, whoo... damn..

[Verse 2]
I stroll down the bassline, like im knowin' a beat
Or a voice, attached to it, not withholdin' to speak
& lettin' loose, coz im 25, goin on 49
Coz im smashin' cougars and MILF's, like all the time
On the real tho', as the time grows older
I feel im gettin bolder, _& im in more control of
_my passion and my quota's, what im lackin, where im rollin'
& ain't nobody ever knowin', where the Notion gon' be goin', (8)
& im talkin' bout how life is a trip
Like you knowin' that Corner of Notion & 9th's the shit
Just trust me baby, don't rush the lazy
Or the situations gon' get all crazy! (ya dig that??)
So this time to come live, & deliver the raw
Don't rush me, lemme give ya score, (ya wit me now??)
The numero-uno that you know, the kid wit the kudos'
& proved those with no I.Q.'s, are fake, yup, & they pseudo
....you know!

Hook:
...im on the right path
I know this shit will last
Dont Rush Me it's a..
Long road, & we comin thru fast
With the Movement Fam' at last, whoo... damn..
