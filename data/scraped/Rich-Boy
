[Intro: Rich Boy]
Zone 4
Get money
New money
It's what you been waiting on

[Hook: Rich Boy]
Rich Boy sellin' crack
Fuck niggas wanna jack
Shit tight no slack
Just bought a Cadillac (Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Just bought a Cadillac (Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Just bought a Cadillac

[Verse 1: Rich Boy]
Rich Boy sellin' crack fuck niggas wanna jack
Shit tight no slack just bought a Cadillac
Took it to the chop shop
Got the damn top dropped two colored flip flopped
Candy red lollipop
There's hoes in the parking lot
But I still got my Glock cocked
New money motherfucker don't you see the big knot
Don't you see the big chain
Don't you see the big rims
Wonder who they hatin' on lately
Baby it's him candy paint
Gator skin seats call me Dundee
Pope in your hood I'm the one that you wanna be
Haters wish they could feel the wood in my '83
Ridin' with no tint so the motherfuckers know it's me

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Polow Da Don]
I never slip, I never fall
A lot of hoes give me they numbers but I never call
A real O.G. -- look at V.I.P. and see a nigga ball
Then after we hit the club baby then I'm gonna hit them draws
I'm gonna break you off (and that's all)
Every freak should have a picture of my dick (on they wall)
Polow be the shit, zone 4 be the click
Yeah this for my dawgs
Yeah gangsters, hustlers, wanksters, busters
(Wait a minute motherfucker)

[Hook: Rich Boy]

[Verse 3: Rich Boy]
Hit the block on some new 10 thousand dollar wheels
Can't explain how I feel
Touchin' gator on my wheel
Got peanut butter ice cream
Peter Pan seats just got a fresh cut
Now we looking for them freaks
Take a bad yella bitch
Make her drop them draws
I'mma show you how to ball
Middle finger to the law so fuck them
Niggas what they wanna do?
Hating on a player cause my 'lac skated 22's
When I pull up I'mma park right at the front door lean
In my cup got purp in my blunt
I'mma real pimp bitch I ain't playin' like a trick
Just bought a new 'Lac bout to put them
Thangs on that bitch![Verse 1 - Rich Boy]
Let me take you through my hood where I was born and raised
Where niggas tote semi-automatics, busting them K's
Heavy guns and dope funds and raids by the police
Still getting pulled over and asked by the police
'Bama wasn't made for a nigga to win
See the color of your skin get you put in the pen
It's real life, over dice, Dwayne dead and gone
Sending niggas to the pen or the funeral home
I be feeling like the Lord will never answer me back
So I'm holding on my gat just in case they attack
Bullet holes in your house will make it hard to sleep
You see the fiends on the street want the hard for cheap
A lot of niggas doing life from undercovers and fake friends
It's real how them penitentiary bars'll break men
Niggas doing life from undercovers and fake friends
It's real how them penitentiary bars'll break men

[Hook - John Legend]
It's where you live, it's where you play
It's where you learn your favorite slang
Your world is ghetto
It's where I live; it's where I'm from
It's where you had to tote your gun
Your world is ghetto

[Verse 2 - Lil Wayne]
I could never win an Oscar cause I don't know how to act
Saw my first million dollars and I ain't know how to act
Then the second million came, then more came after that
Then more came after that, hurricane after that
Damn! And y'all saw the aftermath
And in my hood we don't front, so I do give back
When you see a hood nigga you gotta tilt your hat
And since I'm a hood nigga, I do just that
OGs used to tell me: "You just rap
Lil' nigga all you need to do is rap"
And just when I thought I was gon' do just that
Poppa was a Rolling Stone and them stones was crack
Fuck being like Mike I wanna be like pop
Then I picked up a mic I wanna be like 'Pac
Please put down the pipe you don't need that rock
Please put up a fight for the kids that watch
Us in the spotlight and then they mock
But caskets get closed and then they drop
And cases get closed and they are dropped
'Cause no one knows and nobody got
Any out no N-O, that they better not
Three words to a witness: they get shot
Let me tell you what this is, this is the block
Always talk to God, never listen to cops

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Nas]
It's cool to love to win but it's better to hate to lose
There's only one Nas 'bout a hundred thousand yous
You lose money chasing women, never lose women chasing money
Niggas is broke plus the wolves is hungry
Morgues full of dead niggas who was taking money
Morgues full of niggas with the last shit they ate in stomach
Spinach and steak. GORE-TEX boot prints still on his face
It's still on his face when we visit his wake
Whatever's undone I'd do it, fight against a whole army
One gun I'll use it, some Sun Tzu shit
Creeping on ya like walking pneumonia
You're far from opponents; we could spar for the moments
I stay in deceitful conversations with creeps with foul natures
Attempted murders trials, the basics
Threatening the witnesses and relatives of dead victims
It's the shit we live, uh
Queensbridge thug matrimony, clap a phony
Bullets even hit a cracker in his Abercrombie
Psychoanalyst was asking me what happened to me?
See the yak got to me, then the gat got to me
Then the homies on the block with the stacks of money
Then these beautiful bitches was bending backwards for me
Then lames put the rap game in a casket slowly
Man I don't give a fuck, this is rap to me[Intro: Sample from "I Call Your Name" by Switch]
I used to think about immature things
Y'know like, do you love me, do you want me
Are you gon' call me like you said you would
Is this really your real phone number

[Lil Jon]
Wait a minute motherfuckers

[Verse 1 Andre 3000]
Ain't a hood nigga but a nigga from the ho-od
See Momma stayed on me so I turned out pretty go-od
But if you wanna try, sucker now then we can do it
Ha-ha sleep, Tylenol PM if I pull it
Sh-sh-sheep, count 'em for the rest of ya life
Yeah, yeah your partner got away but now he vegetable-like
So, so I sent his mom and dad a whole case of V8
He can die, any second, how much long it's 'gon take
Gon get it over with, oh what if, you were in my loafers then
You might be the dope but I would flush it down the toilet
Like the boys in blue, when they come through with them boots
And they kickin down the do', and they don't care who they shoot
But we do care who they shoot, so we do what we must do
So we act like we run track, then we run straight to the back
But they comin from the back, so we run back to the front
They say get down on ya knees we say what the fuck you want
They want cheese, they want bread, they want dough, they want mo'
Than I wanna give 'em but if I keep talkin' they won't know
That my cousin in the back, and we call him Roto-Rooter
Slash plumber, cash runner, and he fire on them computers, log out

[Refrain: Rich Boy]
Fuck niggas wanna jack
Shit tight, no slack, just bought a Cadillac
Throw some D's on that bitch
Just bought a Cadillac
Throw some D's on that bitch
Just bought a Cadillac
Rich Boy sellin crack, fuck niggas wanna jack
Shit tight, no slack, just bought a Cadillac
Throw some D's on that bitch
Just bought a Cadillac
Throw some D's on that bitch
Just bought a Cadillac

[Jim Jones]

And we go hard, Zone 4, D-Boy squad

We got a fetish coppin' speedy cars charge it to my Visa card
They never thought that we'd get large

[Murphy Lee]
Lunatics sittin' fat, St. Louis on the map
Sixty-nine wet black, I just got my Cutty back
Throw some D's on that ho, I just got my Cutty back
Throw, throw some D's on that ho, I just got my Cutty back

[Nelly]
How could I slip, how could I fall
When you're baby mama got my poster high up on her wall
And that ain't all she done gave me them drawers

[Murphy Lee]
I'm Murphy Lee please tell yo' sexy little sister I called
Last time she asked me for some money I was sent to the North
But now I'm rich and she can get it see these D's match my fitted

[Nelly]
My paint is banana splitted inside is totally ig'nant
Outside is totally kitted, to be specific it's wicked how them Derrty Boyz did it

[Murphy Lee]
That Buick Regal, I lit it
My Monte Carlo's terrific
That El Dorado (Got switches) Tamika and them, I done hit it
That twenty mill, I done spent it, that house on the hill
And that diamond herringbone you know them niggas did it
Walk up in the strip club, lookin for a big butt
Shawty wanna get fucked, I brought about ten what
Throw throw some ones on 'em Mo, I brought about ten what
Throw throw some ones on 'em Mo, I brought about ten what

[Refrain: Rich Boy]

[Rich Boy]
It's Rich Boy yeah baby I'm a baller
I dropped a hit and had to go park my Impala
I threw some D's on that Lac and now it's taller
They see the wheels on my De Ville so they holla
Let's get this dollar, I got the fat man 'Lac
Took it to the paint shop and got the fat man black
I hold my jacket with my Tokyo Adidas on
Ho don't even call my phone if you ain't gonna get me on
So fuck you haters, I'll see you later
Might see the gator, in my Escalator
Mama told me put some D's on it son you ridin' wrong
So I took them 20's off and put the monster wheels on

[Refrain: Rich Boy]

[The Game]
All red Chevrolet, 26's ridin' high
Dukes of Hazard doors, in Compton we call 'em suicides
Suede roof, leather seats, woodgrain steering wheel
Candy apple hardtop, Game logo on the grill
California license plate ridin' through the A-T-L
Keep my tires bald I never leave a paper trail
Nah I'm a keep it clean, ball when I hit the scene
Elbow out the window, show 'em how to gangsta lean
Put Cali on the map, westside on my back
Hometown on my face, forty-five on my lap
Twenty in my earlobe, hundred on my neck piece
Just bought a Bentley nigga and  I'm a throw some D's on that bitch
Pull up at the rim shop and throw some D's on that bitch
Might as well cut the top
Let the sunshine in and the bass jump out
Hit the block 15's vibratin' the whole fuckin' house[Verse 1]
I fly like paper, get high like planes
[If you catch me at the border I got visas in my name
If you come around here, I make 'em all day
I get one done in a second if you wait [x2]

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I think sittin' on trains
Every stop I get to I'm clocking that game
Everyone's a winner we're making our fame
Bonafide hustler making my name [x2]

[Hook]
All I wanna do is *Bang Bang Bang Bang*
And *Click* *Ka-Ching*
And take your money [x4]

[Verse 3: Bun B]
Man I'm rollin' through the city, old school on them big boys
12 inch woofers in the trunk making big noise
Got the big toys (toys), dont make me have to flash
Let a hundred rounds go, you do a hundred yard dash
Back up in the hood where the rules dont shift
And the gangstas talk trills, sip purp and burn piff
You can call 5-0 and 5-0 might come
But by the time that they arrive all that dirt had been done
Now one things for certain, and two things for sure
Being poor is a disease, gotta hustle up a cure
Start with your head homie then use your hands
If you try it in reverse, you dont even have a chance
We worldwide worried with the hunger and the thirst
From the third world countries to the second and the first
It sounds like a verse but its more like a plan
Get your Robin Hood on, put some pressure on the man, tell it!

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Rich Boy]
I wake up in the morning with my bitch in the bed
She don't like the police and she sure hate the feds
I love my girl cause she gives me what I want
She ride in the trunk or either ride in the front
She looks like 22 but she really 45
Some reason she done made a whole lotta niggas cry
So bad that she make ‘em all pull they money out
Take it out they pockets and they put it in my pouch
Ouch! gotta hurt the way that girl do ya
She always wanna what take, take, take the moolah
Gimmie them pesos the cash and the credit card
Might be a broad but the lil' bitch hit ya hard
You the police and we is the robbers
You need more than them helicopters to stop us
Excuse me, let me introduce my lady
Her name is Beretta and she mothafuckin crazy![Produced by Neenyo]

[Intro]
I've got it made thats what I'm talking about
Going down to the fashion store and get myself fitted out
Going down to the dealers buy myself a brand new car
So me and my lady can ride

[Verse 1: Drake]
Check, I wish y'all coulda seen me back in high school, backpack
Grey range black Ac'
Put a half a stack out just to get a stack back
Double that school dance, Fresh J's, new pants
Back when "fuck bitches, get money" was the new chant
It started out a boy like Hugh Grant
Now I'm a young man doin things you can't
But you can't call me Champagne Charlie
I campaign hardly
My damn chain glitter ruby red
The type of shit that leave your hand stained scarlet
I live it, thought you knew this
I swear that we been through this
Your boyfriends future plans got 'em on todays to-do list
Cause he rollin wit more squares then you would find up on a rubix
Bingo, money ain't a thing ho
That prometh with that sprite and jolly rancher so flamingo
I ain't speaking in code real niggas they know the lingo
Cause when I'm in the spot it's popping like Christopher's single

[Hook]
If ya'll dont like me then (you must hate money, money)
Guaranteed if you had it to spare you could probably comprehend im just sayin man (you must hate money, money)
They be gettin jealous when you paid, savin everything they made, I keep thnkin that (you must hate money, money)
Telling people my image is lame, and im whats wrong with the game, but im feelin like (you must hate money, money)
Considering everywhere I go got couple grand to blow man you know

[Verse 2: Rich Boy]
Hey, I'm flyer then a motherfucker
Haters wanna see me dead like John Tucker(so)
I'm in that big boy 550 s-class
I hit the gas and watch them hoes waving through the glass
Pimp glass im riding new in 2008 (say what)
I hit them hoes and send em home, you take em on a date
That white gucci ticker let em know there's money here
I grip the cline and sit on seats thats made of cashmere
5 karats in my ear, you see them hoes jock?
Bitch theres a whole lota rocks up in this powder watch
I'm writin letters to the pen for my brother irving
Send him a picture of that drop with me in it swervin
Hotter than a bitch rock, Cooler than some ice cream
Gotta feed myself I'm up here living in a dream
My cadillac mean but my 88 a beast
If bein fly against the law bitch call the po-lice

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Drake]
Stacks on deck, lac's mounted on D's
I dont trust you so make sure you count it all please
And once its all there, then that put me at ease
And these niggas just mad cause they account is on freeze
Baby pay attention please, I'm more coordinated then a dance team
Its my turn, my turn like advance green
My true religion is money, check out the pant seams
I got cash in my palm I call it hand cream
And I just want the paper
My momma trying to go to rome and I just wanna take her
Im tryin to figure what the los angle is like a laker
So I can be on beaches with my niggas in jamaica
I say 'baby get low', You just getting by
They hating cause my swagger at a all time high
Shit its a damn shame homie I dont even try
Get money mofo is all you hear me reply

[Hook][Rich Boy]
My Maserati and Ferrari like to chill with my Mercedes
See my Bentley what I got when my two Phantoms had a baby
Ain't that crazy? Why you lazy?
I get chauffeured like Ms. Daisy
Fuck you Pussy-Nigga, pay me!
My Lambo' do 'bout two-eighty
Thought you sellin', heard you tellin'
Thought you killin' why you stealin'
Thought you dealin' why you chillin'
You ain't ballin' with a million

God made me super rich, the Devil made you stupid bitch!
You could be just like me if you quit with all that stupid shit
Why you actin' hard now? You must want to go see God now
The same niggers you were beafin' with are up in your yard now
If you 'bout to run Dog, I guess you better start now
You forgot to bring your gun so you got to use your heart now

It's hard to get rich but it ain't shit to go to hell;
It's hard to sell dope but it ain't shit to go to jail;
It's hard to keep it real but it ain't shit for you to tell;
I smoke so much of this that I can't even hide the smell

Now drop!

[Verse 2]
We marijuana farmers, all our rides look like transformers
Tell the pretty girls to pull their titties out and dance for us
You don't need a gym class
Crack like Slim Fast
Take a hit and lose a fuckin' hundred pounds quick fast

Snow cone, the Chain on
I'm default, the Chain on
My blunt goin' keep the game off
We never take a game off!
Find a hater, sign a hater!
Let 'em see my elevator
Hundreds in my 'frigerator
Now they know we're gettin' paper! (x2)

Pull the coupe, the Escalade
The enemy's on respirators
Million dollar generators
Sly defense, investigate us
For fetchin' cars, the prison bars
Menage e trois, they're playing cards
I swear its hard!
Now drop!

Now Drop!{Hook X2]
Do it she do it, she do it, do it, do it
She do it she do it, she do it, do it, do it
Eh do it bitch, do it

She do it she do it she do it, do it, do it
Do it bitch, do it
Ya do it bitch, do it

[Verse 1]
Do it bitch do it drop it put your back in to it
Shake your money maker and you know them dollars make you move it
Let me see your G-spot you can suck me up all night
Your friend wanna to watch she can jump it off a pink rod
Thick fine bad bitches duffel bag cash getting
Couple grams stashed in it man I’m like wheres penny
And look out how she pour with it
Sometimes she be gold digging
Man one of my hoes tripping you know I be slow slipping
She do it look how she got that body right
She called me out to come through I come over she get me right
Baby do the shit bend over right there and sit
She told me she wanted that in her mouth but that way to big

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Look how she do that shit from the back and on top again
She know I’m watching that Halle Berry banana split
So ghetto super thick tattoos on her neck and her wrist
She leaving with me and not the niggas she came with
She back it back legged back at a ballers from the back
I asked her where she work, she said the mall poppin tags
I said poppin tags? She said poppin tags
I should’ve known when I’ve seen her with them shopping bags
Chanel, Versace, Gucci, Prada knock off nada
Mommy spend a lot of dollars yes, euros 0s, comma es plural do it girl

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Look at she touch her toes bend over and drop it to the floor
She like to do it, her momma can do it better though
Say she 21 she ain’t tripping she want to have some fun
Now she getting wild on the act and I’m trying to get me some
Take a shot get with it, how do it, don’t never let it stop
Know you like Ciroc but I’m sipping some Henny on the rocks
What you want to show and tell baby I want to see
Do it for my niggas at least if you don’t do it for me

[Hook][Verse 1 - Rich Boy]
I remember when I met'cha I was only sixteen
Who would ever thought that me and you would get this cream?
We took a lot of trips together, you stayed down
Remember when we start hoppin' on that Greyhound?
She say she like to play hide and seek in the ride
And sure I'll open up the trunk and hide her inside
She say she think I'm cheatin' wit' a girl named Jane
You ain't just my babay, bitch, you my everythang
I was broke but you maintained better
As long as me and you together we can get this cheddar
Whatever, her name white Sally
I met her through my homeboy Rico out in Cali
I thank Reagan for the haters when ya got hard
Ya bought me jewels, gator shoes and some big cars
Yeah you took me out the hood gave me good thangs
Now we on a private plane eatin' chicken wangs

[Hook]
(And I love you) You the reason why I ride good
You the reason why I shop good, drink good, smoke good
(And I love you) You the reason why these hoes choose
You the reason why a nigga sprayed candy on my old school
(And I love you) You the reason why I quarterback
Took a nigga out the projects, put me in a cul-de-sac
That's why I get it how I live boy
Cause you took me from a young broke nigga to a rich boy

[Verse 2 - Pastor Troy]
And I love you babay, mwah, hugs and kisses
Fuck them niggas and fuck them bitches
Been in this game since 1998
Nigga take the safety and shit but I'm great
Maybe it's fate destiny, you tell me
Damn near ten and that shit been free
But I'm P.T. so I gots to cruise nigga
Really ain't shit to prove to y'all niggas
All the cars, all the clothes
Wit' all the stars, and all the hoes
First class flights a nigga live in the lights
But see you in the dark, this stuff is kinda hard
See where I park, valet costs a note
Drop another fifty just to check my coat
Probably leave wit' yo' chick, know how I do
It's Pastor Disaster baby, I love you

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Big Boi]
Took me from a gun totin' nigga to a Big Boi
Too legit to slip now I got papers on my shit boi
And not just my weapons I'm talkin' 'bout titles and deeds
You payin' rent you can't afford and can't break out of ya lease
I'm out of ya league, I might as well be Ivy
All over ya ass like injections in a stripper's hiney
Rhyming is a skill that requires timing
Like dual ejaculation while my lady's riding
I'm 'bout to cum (I'm 'bout to cum) at the same time
You satisfied? (I'm satisfied) that's how I slang mine
A generation came up under my style
From penetration of the nation when I was just a child
Now, who's really in the critics talk 'bout me
Andre 3000 and three mo' niggas that's really fie
Let me break it down, I get fly at that mouth

Say I talk slow, and I rhyme funny
But I ain't thinkin' 'bout nothin' but the big money
Big cake, big shrimp on a big plate
Nigga so iced out like a snowflake
Don't hate, big crib wit' the big lake
Say she wanna taste, some of that milkshake
Put'cha money where ya ass at and run that
Just gettin' started nigga we done done that
What you know about them folks that was shootin' it off?
While y'all was lyin', runnin' and movin' ya moss
Homeboy we ain't goin' for the okie doke

If these hollow points hit'cha nigga it's a wrap

[Hook 2]

[Hook 2]

[Music out][Intro]
Yeah! Leh go!
Throw a hundred on the fifty try and break the pot
Need a bank straight to the top
Throw a hundred on the fifty try and break the pot

[Verse 1]
Nigga, have you ever spend a hundred fifty thou cash on the court case
Walk up out that bitch, grab your nuts and turn back towards the base
Big wheels with that monster knock, box chevrolet with the big block
When I pull up on the spot, bitch wipe me down when I'm hoping out
And I'm tired of this and I'm tired of that
One thing for certain, my pockets fat
I love the cheese but I hate the rats
They talking shit but don't know the facts
Now pour me up that purple stuff, mix me up a whole nother deuce
I love the money and the bitches too
Now drop it for me baby what it do, uhh

[Hook]
Rich boy, yeah
Throw a hundred on the fifty try and break the pot, pot

Throw a hundred on the fifty try and break the pot, yeah
Throw a hundred on the fifty try and break the pot, yeah
Break break break the pot
Throw a hundred on the fifty try and break the pot

[Verse 2]
My bitch sore, that pussy holding
Then bust it open on stripper poles
I put rubber bands on my bankrolls
My ice so cold, north pole froze
My diamonds signed and my hoes fine
This smoke time and I'm rolling mine
Don't ask for shit, so I gotta grind
This life we live, we don't wait in line
Peter Pan, break the pot, rip it off and nigga make a lot
You're talking like you were in block
But you copped out and told the cop
Can't copy me I'm too many styles
She tipsy and I acting better wise
She suck a dick and making freaky sounds
Hey pussy nigga, how you like me now?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Niggas notice how my hoes kiss
And get so high when I smoke this
Ballin' hard on my court, bitch
Ballin' hard with that Jordan wrist
My pearl paint can you looking pissed
I'm shootin this, I bet you miss
Prosecutors can't make it stick
My part of them keep switchin lick
Pimps like me with the game ain't fold
Sick nigga hoes in one condo
Smoke and blow, roll up one more
They burn up till my eyes turn low
Drop my top with the car remote
Pull out slow, that's all she wrote
Go deep throat I'mma dick no choke
And do this shit like it's all you know

[Hook][Intro: Tyga]
Put the lime in the coconut and twist it all up {*3X*}
Twist it all up! (Remix baby~!)

[Lil Wayne]
I'm, about to go dumb
I'm about to go dumb, like Fred Sanford's son
Ah-um, I'm about to go coconuts
And when it comes to money man, I'm about to go Oprah
And you ain't got to vote for us cause we ain't never runnin'
So you better get back like we ain't never buntin'
Yeah, I put the lime in the open blunt
And twist it all up baby I am not the sober one
I'm from the jungle where the lion ate the cobra
And I get money, got a no-money phobia
Uh-huh, Tyga-Tyga what it do
Man, we are flyer than the pigeon in the coop
Man, I am hotter than a nigga in a suit
In the middle of the summer, and I bang like a drummer
Wayne's that nukka, holla at ya gualla
Make the money chase the shadow, call it dollar after dollar

[Hook: Tyga]
Put the lime in the coconut and twist it all up {*3X*}
Twist it all up! Twist it all up!

[Hook Two: Tyga]
Coconut juice got me real loose, like
Got me leanin' three thousand proof, like
Coconut juice all on the dance FLOOR
Fellas let your ladies GO ladies let your fellas GO

[Tyga]
In low, +No Introduction+
WAIT, was that an introduction?
Fo-forget it, I stu-stu-stu-stutter just so you can get it
My diamonds so bright, I get picture tickets to tit it
No, Im lyin', right here the Tyga, no Lion
Tyga flowed, humanater, a butter roll tale, you do this slow
Smokings on me, don't touch me, still blow
Cause she won't be missed like Ben Gorden free throws
Uh-uh, Its the cheap coal from marciano
And I'm in the game, but my fame on the d-low
Me no, speak no, broke money english
Loyal I'll be forever in a lake like seaglus
Jesus, couldn't even save me from the visa
So I keep ha, historic names in my James
Ben Frank, name tag be Tyga man
Oh, you mad cause the chase, stylin' with straight Tyga man

[Hook One]

[Rich Boy]
I'mma get some flames over the horn of artagrab
Bitch ain't a buff, until you have a whole sale
I'll take the coconut juice and mix it with a old goose
Hutchy hoot-a-hoot fryin' some Russian red kook
My livin' ATM, wishin' my shit money grain
I should have bought an office, I went and bought a ring
Instead I ride dirty, said I shoulda bought the ring
Instead of coconut juice it I mixed it with the lean
AKA the rich one, Cartier yeah the Benjamin
If you ain't a bitch, why the fuck you ain't that feminine
When I twisted it up, she licked it up, the whole coconut
Thats it, the whole coconut

[Hook One]

[Hook Three: Tyga]
Everybody in the party
Hold your cup high move your body
If you twist it, scream it loudly
Ay, ay, ay, HEY! Ay, ay, ay, HEY![Rich Boy]
My Maserati and Ferrari like to chill with my Mercedes
See my Bentley what I got when my two Phantoms had a baby
Ain't that crazy? Why you lazy?
I get chauffeured like Ms. Daisy
Fuck you Pussy-Nigga, pay me!
My Lambo' do 'bout two-eighty
Thought you sellin', heard you tellin'
Thought you killin' why you stealin'
Thought you dealin' why you chillin'
You ain't ballin' with a million

God made me super rich, the Devil made you stupid bitch!
You could be just like me if you quit with all that stupid shit
Why you actin' hard now? You must want to go see God now
The same niggers you were beafin' with are up in your yard now
If you 'bout to run Dog, I guess you better start now
You forgot to bring your gun so you got to use your heart now

It's hard to get rich but it ain't shit to go to hell;
It's hard to sell dope but it ain't shit to go to jail;
It's hard to keep it real but it ain't shit for you to tell;
I smoke so much of this that I can't even hide the smell

Now drop!

[Verse 2]
We marijuana farmers, all our rides look like transformers
Tell the pretty girls to pull their titties out and dance for us
You don't need a gym class
Crack like Slim Fast
Take a hit and lose a fuckin' hundred pounds quick fast

Snow cone, the Chain on
I'm default, the Chain on
My blunt goin' keep the game off
We never take a game off!
Find a hater, sign a hater!
Let 'em see my elevator
Hundreds in my 'frigerator
Now they know we're gettin' paper! (x2)

Pull the coupe, the Escalade
The enemy's on respirators
Million dollar generators
Sly defense, investigate us
For fetchin' cars, the prison bars
Menage e trois, they're playing cards
I swear its hard!
Now drop!

Now Drop!(Verse: Rich Boy)
I’m on the over-night, long flight
I’m bout that jet life
Hella ice, [?] bright, beamin' like some headlights
Hit the switch and watch that bitch go front, back, left, right
Hydraulic, hopping dropping scraping up the tailpipe
[?], [?] with the racing track
Engine muscle car, transmission taking out the competition
Old school, antique, hear me beat from up the street
Two women at the same time tryna suck on me
Drivin' fast, looking at digital custom dash, paint
Job drippin’ wet looking like a piece of glass
Everything I envision, exactly how I'm livin'
Out the country, shit
Champagne pissin’
Bad bitches I be with, I fucked them hoes you couldn’t hit
Make em come and suck some dick, pop that pussy, do a split
Penthouse suit, from the bed you can see the beach
Chillin’ at the jet lounge, burnin’ one with Curren$y

(Verse 2: Curren$y)
Uh, batteries in my trunk
My car swayin’ in em lanes but the driver not drunk
He a rider momma, jump in that Impala
Let that color bar dazzle ya, capture the baddest passengers
Tryna sneak selfies of themselves in the Chevy
With the Captain Andretti on the wheels
And he will stay ready to hit the switch concrete
Meet the metal, four tails sparks like my lighter do
And I been doin’ this since bicycles I had the Stingray
Schwinn with the 8 ball caps on my valve stems
That’s him, back when niggas thought I wouldn’t do it
And I had to show em, I move em with hydraulic fluid
And I really own em, I ain’t lyin’ in my music, just relying on my crew to keep an eye out for looters
Keep an eye out for shooters
Keep an eye out for losers[Hook: Mista Raja]
We on that gangsta gangsta gangsta gangsta X4

[Verse 1: Rich Boy]
I bought my girl haha laughing at the rest
You act like u can make her wet
But u should be ashamed of that
I float the cash and make it back
You struggle tryin to stack a stack
No matter what you know we strapped, where you at?
I flipped her first and then her cousin
Got that bread coming out the oven
Hydrocodin mixed with tusin
Kick them hoes I used to cuff, ain’t fucking they
Now she drop it like a nugget
Super star but now she buggin, come her girl and show me something

[Mista Raja]
I was turning up the bass, I was on a paperchase
Pen write with big bank, 50 on my briefcase
Bitch if you ain’t cool enough who you think you foolin huh?
My wrist cold as a freezer got to get my dollars up

[Hook: Mista Raja]

[Verse 2: Rich Boy
You a gangsta ain’t ya, riddled with ya finga
No time to cock it when niggas poppin and you in danger
More money could it be, big dollars be calling me
This show ain’t over with, there’s so much more to see
Cadillac audis and nex ridin around wit 200 racks
Hustle hard take it to the max, purp loud comin out the back
Dope boy be cookin that crack, blow that flip that back
Niggas already know my rap, a mill sold nigga look at that plaque
I turn power for cash pull up and drop the anchor
You scared to hustle that’s more for me my nigga thank ya
My daily routine count cash jus like a banker
Back to the streets to get this cheese, this shit is gangsta

[Hook: Mista Raja]

[Verse 3: Rich Boy]
Who do I see acting, pussy let me have it
Time for me to cash it, at the bank im laughing
Bumping and Im blasting we puff it and pass it
Swerve it through the traffic coming like a
Hit them with the Apple juice getting drunk with no excuse
I’m guilty for drug abuse getting high and rolling too
Suckers see and try to be wish they would but can’t be me
Niggas say they gangsta but they everythang except a G
Errtime you see me I bet you
High stuck up in the clouds no suckers in here allowed
Money speaks, on my mind cross with me and game time
365 24/7 the same grind

[Hook: Mista Raja]Here I come

...When niggas get to poppin[Verse 1 - Rich Boy]
Let me take you through my hood where I was born and raised
Where niggas tote semi-automatics, busting them K's
Heavy guns and dope funds and raids by the police
Still getting pulled over and asked by the police
'Bama wasn't made for a nigga to win
See the color of your skin get you put in the pen
It's real life, over dice, Dwayne dead and gone
Sending niggas to the pen or the funeral home
I be feeling like the Lord will never answer me back
So I'm holding on my gat just in case they attack
Bullet holes in your house will make it hard to sleep
You see the fiends on the street want the hard for cheap
A lot of niggas doing life from undercovers and fake friends
It's real how them penitentiary bars'll break men
Niggas doing life from undercovers and fake friends
It's real how them penitentiary bars'll break men

[Hook - John Legend]
It's where you live, it's where you play
It's where you learn your favorite slang
Your world is ghetto
It's where I live; it's where I'm from
It's where you had to tote your gun
Your world is ghetto

[Verse 2 - Lil Wayne]
I could never win an Oscar cause I don't know how to act
Saw my first million dollars and I ain't know how to act
Then the second million came, then more came after that
Then more came after that, hurricane after that
Damn! And y'all saw the aftermath
And in my hood we don't front, so I do give back
When you see a hood nigga you gotta tilt your hat
And since I'm a hood nigga, I do just that
OGs used to tell me: "You just rap
Lil' nigga all you need to do is rap"
And just when I thought I was gon' do just that
Poppa was a Rolling Stone and them stones was crack
Fuck being like Mike I wanna be like pop
Then I picked up a mic I wanna be like 'Pac
Please put down the pipe you don't need that rock
Please put up a fight for the kids that watch
Us in the spotlight and then they mock
But caskets get closed and then they drop
And cases get closed and they are dropped
'Cause no one knows and nobody got
Any out no N-O, that they better not
Three words to a witness: they get shot
Let me tell you what this is, this is the block
Always talk to God, never listen to cops

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Nas]
It's cool to love to win but it's better to hate to lose
There's only one Nas 'bout a hundred thousand yous
You lose money chasing women, never lose women chasing money
Niggas is broke plus the wolves is hungry
Morgues full of dead niggas who was taking money
Morgues full of niggas with the last shit they ate in stomach
Spinach and steak. GORE-TEX boot prints still on his face
It's still on his face when we visit his wake
Whatever's undone I'd do it, fight against a whole army
One gun I'll use it, some Sun Tzu shit
Creeping on ya like walking pneumonia
You're far from opponents; we could spar for the moments
I stay in deceitful conversations with creeps with foul natures
Attempted murders trials, the basics
Threatening the witnesses and relatives of dead victims
It's the shit we live, uh
Queensbridge thug matrimony, clap a phony
Bullets even hit a cracker in his Abercrombie
Psychoanalyst was asking me what happened to me?
See the yak got to me, then the gat got to me
Then the homies on the block with the stacks of money
Then these beautiful bitches was bending backwards for me
Then lames put the rap game in a casket slowly
Man I don't give a fuck, this is rap to me[Rich Boy]
Let me take ya through my hood where I was born and raised
Where niggas tote semi-automatics, busting them K's
Heavy guns and dope boys harassed by the police
Still getting pulled over and asked by the police
Bama wasn't made for a nigga to win
See the color of ya skin get ya put in the pen
It's real life, over dice, Dwayne dead and gone
Sending niggas to the pen or the funeral home
I be feeling like the Lord will never answer me back
So I'm holding on my gat just in case they attack
Bullet holes in ya house it'll make it hard to sleep
Ya see the fiends on the street want the hard for cheap
Lotta niggas doing life from undercovers and fake friends
It's real how them penitentiary bars'll break men
Niggas doing life from undercovers and fake friends
It's real how them penitentiary bars'll break men

(chorus) John Legend
It's where ya live, it's where ya play
It's where ya learn, ya favorite slang
Your world is, ghetto
It's where I live; it's where I'm from
It's where ya had, to tote your gun
Your world is, ghetto

Good Things Don't Last Forever Baby

Ain't No If's And But's Or Maybe's
You'll Always Be My Friend
You Will Always Be
You Will Always Be
Say You'll Always Be
My Friend

She Want To Know What The Reason I'm Saying She Can Be My Friend
But Baby I'm a Player Ain't No Reason To Pretend
Might've seen me in M.I.A. riding phantom of the Benz
With a beautiful bitch her hair blowin' in the wind
(see I'm true to this shit)
Hope that you can comprehend
What I'm spitting is pimping and the rules don't bend
Yup, you lookin' good
But ya mind ain't right
Some niggas been tellin' ya
She's quite alright
By [??] you need to let me put this "I" in your life
Not the booze from behind from the side how you like
I don't wanna spend forever with you baby just tonight
If you can hop in my backseat that'll be a delight
From the looks of that ass you and nigga type
If you can bring me some cash, baby you're Mrs. Right
You say you gotta man and you don't know if this is right
(Thats why I need you to be like polow da don!)

[Hook]

You're The Only Girl I Wanna See Daily
Not A lot Save Me But You Could Be My Lady
Let's Take It To Another Level You Remember
The First Day I Got you What You Want And
It Wasn't Even Your Birthday Nah Now
We Kick It To Hard You Went To Deep
Say You Feel It In Your Heart So
I'm Be Real Cause You Give Me What I Want
And I Ain't Gonna Tell You I Love You If I Don't
I Understand That You Got A Man At Your Crib
But He Can't Even Understand How You Feel
But If You Stop Coming Around
And I Don't See You Again I Guess We Can
Just Be... Woooo

[Hook]

Now Ladies You All Know What I'm Talking About
See I Don't Want A Man That Just Be Dipping
In And Out Of My Life I Want A Friend That'll Be
There Thick And Thin You Know What I'm Saying
Someone To Take It Back to the Isley's
I Want Somebody To Always Run Back To Me
And Trust I'll Always Be Here With *That Good Thang*

If I Couldn't Walk Again Would You
Still Be There For Me If I Lost It All Today
Would You Care For Me? Yeah Would You Write Me in the pen?
Kinda Of Friend That Will Be There Without The Benz?
Like An Angel From Above God Sent Me You Never Ask About The Money That You
Lent Me Nah You Look Good With Your
Body You're The Type Of Girl That Money

[Hook][Wayne Blazed Hook]
Shorty keep it hood

She's my gutta chick
Down to do what whatever, whatever

[Rich Boy Verse 1]
I told the girl rewind it, she always like to ride it
I zip it up and hide it but she always come and find it
My pimping pop a playa, just politics and paper
And I position it for me
Come here ladies let me see
I'm a dog, and bitch I ball in the rain
And the big kush gon chevy on some motherfucking things
Show me that you love me, girl come and suck me
If I let you in my door to see the dick
Then you lucky' thats my main boose bottom bitch
I gave her dame and some dick
Damn, how she swallow it
Damn, how she polish it
Damn after I buss
She right back on the top of it (huh) (yeah) (aye)
Ain't no stopping it
Every night she ride it right pussy gripping super tight
When she can't get me on the phone she want to pussy fight
Could it be? What we doing wrong girl if its feeling strong?
Face sinking in the pillow gripping in pillow holding on harder!

[Hook]

[Trae Tha Truth Verse 2]
So I turned up with this hood bitch
Late night on these backstreets
Audition in the take pipe, ass out on my backseat
It ain't nothing like me I show her for real
Tell her to sit it off then I tell her to chill
Put under the spotlight when I show her the grill
Mike Vick on that ass, got me running' the field
Can't equip the pipe, tell her I need a fix
Four in the morning, got her ass doing tricks
DJ Trae about to put it in the mix
Crack her ass open then throw in a couple chicks
You never know might even star in a couple flicks
Let go, made over rapping a couple bricks
Real shit, what I'm on is so sick
How to shape swag ass to thick
C thru dress, everything else missing
She know about to hit it when I get in position
Telling me go down, that's what she wishing
But I ain't eating shit less it come out the kitchen
You can call me Truth Hefner yeah i go hard
You wear who ass out?, bitch I go hard
Put you in time out for a couple of days
Got the headboard beating like a couple of cars
Stroke game top rank like a couple of stars
Like something i spit for a couple of bars
Yea, truth or real, spaceship looking like it's fresh off mars
And you may not wanna miss it if it take off
One hell of a ride, all brakes off
It should've been a warning or something
The way she got a nigga tryna fuck her face off

[Twista Verse 3]
When I look at her I can see she from the hood
So thick and her eyes so red
I heard that she got that good
And if you got a bottle then them thighs goin spread
It ain't never that she a ho
But she'd be fucking' with a real nigga when he come through
Got it laid out for me with a buddy on her side
Just in case I wanna fuck with her too
After the Nicki Minaj, and sticky massage
You see it was a tricky mirage
And if you feel sad cause she a stone cold killa
You ain't never really gotta call her pretty, she hot
She hold them thangs and if it's drama and we really need the tool
She know how to control them thangs
And stay ever ready to bust
Bagging up work and smoking good
But she really want roll and bang
Her Appetite for destruction, it's prevalent
She good and hard but don't try to play her cause of her elegance
Never let feelings start developing
Though she got some good head she still like the dead president
Put your ass in the box, bad but a chick
Still a gutta chick what a chick they'll show you how to cut a brick
Run a lick so succulent
Stuck 'em for a fit then stick 'em for a shit
Who you fucking with?

[Hook]

[Too Short Verse 3]
I think I'm Hugh Hefner, I'm Charlie Sheen
I fuck these hoes then I hardly see 'em
She's 19, I'm older than her father was
He in the pin though so he don't bother us
I'm her daddy now and she be getting down
My little gangsta bitch, I found her in the town
She got a pretty face, kinda grimy mayne
If I tell her get it, she gon find them things
And bring 'em to me, make her daddy proud
You could fuck her if you cash her out
But don't fall asleep next to my bitch
Cause if you do, she gon take a lot of shit
I rise her well, I taught 'er how to rob a trick
Take a balling nigga and hit a lick
She's a gutta bitch, she's from the hood
But I don't like square bitches so it's all good

[Hook]
[Too Short talking][Hook]
We got 'em goin down for the count, looking at the ground
That's why we got haters, that's why we got haters
Haters everywhere we go, haters everywhere we go
Haters everywhere we go, where we go
Haters goin down for the count (one) looking at the ground (two)
I think you're a hater, I think you're a hater
Haters everywhere we go, haters everywhere we go
Haters everywhere we go, where we go, haters goin down for the count

[Verse 1: B.o.B.]
Yes sir it's the beast from Decatur
Cain't see enemies and the haters
Real sharp on my thing like a razor
Blade, come clean like a shape up
So guess I got a game of tape up
But e'rybody gonna feel the need to say sum'n
But can't speak up whenever you face 'em
Thats what I call microphone gangsters
Yea I got 'em okie-doke, yeah I'm raw you know my flow
Cause B.o.B. be actin hard like a Viagra overdose
Talkin that noise on all them songs
A buncha lil' boys but you all look grown
Those niggas there and these niggas here
It really don't matter cause they all just clones
Go to school, read a book, be a lawyer
Hell yeah man I'm all for the cause
Ain't tryin to get involved with the law sir
But a nigga will get caught with the Mausberg
And that just ain't a threat on the song
Don't get it wrong cause this track is my own
Cause niggas that slip they don't last long

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wes Fif]
Hey - what the heck, breathe homie, me I'm doin what I always do
Grindin if you wasn't steady hatin you'd be ballin too
I know you see us fallin through, all the rich niggas is on my crew
Fuck it, they can't touch us, if stuck up is what you call it cool
Ooh~! You shoulda seen when I came down in that
Black on black, custom gator, haters face down on the mat
Splat! Yeah I can make a green nigga mad
Quick, fast, flash like ten cash on his bitch ass
You can tell I'm a G by the walk and the stance
How I play the game make 'em talk in the stands
Watch how you talk when you talk to the man
If it ain't about bread you can talk to the hand
I, I, show you how to get rich
You got a weak arm I'll show you how to pitch
Made it so play I'll show you how to hit
And tell the police I don't know about shit
Ay guy, I'm fly, something like the air
Ain't that somethin when it's stuntin man there's nothing like air
Homey hold it right there, homeboy hold it down
Spent five at the mall and had the haters goin down

[Hook][Intro]
Zone Fo'

Bitches love me they niggas hate me, I know why {*3X*}
Twenty-fours on the Chevy, look like I'm 'bout to fly

[Gucci Mane]
Take flight on a ho, ride a kite on a bitch
Lear jet Gucci, when I ride on 6's
Gotta sit high, like my ride on switches
Rent it out the ass dudes barking hoes keep looking
Shackles wanna jet, but they don't keep bak
Candy coated 'llac, with the brat pushed back
Shorty smoke thrax, what'chu know 'bout that?
Let the top back, the hood catch contact
It's a known fact, Gucci smoke on purp'
Old school verty, with the ace on the skirts
See the tucked dash, paint look like glass
I came through skatin, and they done start hatin
Twenty-eight D-U-B's on rotate
These haters roll dank, I tell 'em get'chu straight
Twenty-eight D-U-B's on rotate
These haters roll dank, I tell 'em get'chu straight

See me in the club wanna suck me
Guess that's why you mad and wanna buck me
Tellin them niggas you gon' kill me
But you's a bitch, you gotta feel me
I ride around the ghetto, two hundred thousand on the slab
Spent a million on my jewels and a million on my 'llac
Three million in the bank, fo' million in property
That's nine million dollars and your wife still jockin me
IRS still watchin me they hate niggas with paper
Didn't like me in school, but now the bitch caught +The Vapors+
Like Biz Markie, she got what I need
She thinkin it's the pussy, it's her money and her weeeeeave
I like her head, but I love her bread
Them hoes want a Pimp but them hoes just scared

[Hook] - 2X

Air Willie, nina on my side
I'm sittin so high I don't ride I glide
Slide, them thirty-two inches on my Phantom
Them blades choppin on that bitch lookin like a gremlin
Ho I'm a winner, I deserve a trophy
If you ain't got no money then nigga don't approach me

[Hook] - 2XI'm on one, I'm on one
Who want one? Who want one?

[Hook]
I'm on one, girl I can't lie

[Verse 1 - Gucci Mane]
In the club and this girl really dig me
Her lil baby brother wanna be like Gucci
Got a plasma screen chain like a 60'' movie
Shorty say "borin" - Gucci starts grooving!
Gnarly, Bob Marley, I'm smoking
No need to fix the flow: it's not broken
Hate Gucci Mane - is you rolling?
Bitch I might be, but I sure ain't broken
Gucci do the Gucci shoes, never do the pro-keds
So Icey Entertainment: call me young showbiz
Where did he go kid?
"Mama that's the Gucci Mane!
Can he be my step-daddy? Then we'll be icy!"
Shorty got swag, but her swag don't touch me
Underarm kush dogg, don't it smell musty?
Bart Simpson chain, mane, ?
Got a pound of purple kush, and It got no seeds
Bad boy Gucci Mane: stacking up groceries
Now I'm tryna bubble kush, now I got no sleep
Bad boy Gucci Mane: stacking up groceries

[Hook]
I'm on one, girl I can't lie
I'm on one, girl I can't lie
Geeked up in the club, baby, we so high!

The bitch go so dumb when she pop one
I got some Skittles in my bag if you want some
If you want one, bitch I'm the X-Man!
Riding 3 ?
I put em on a Superman and watch em get loose
When bitches come through, I tell em bring their girl too
It's swallow dick/truth, drink it like Grey Goose
They like who in the mini coop with the missing roof
I'm so high I can't see a thing
But it feels so good when I'm getting brain!
I'm high up in the sky
Whatever you demand, I supply, you can buy
My eyes so red, boy I'm so outta here
Is it really me? Or is it fuckin hot in here?

[Hook]
I'm on one, girl I can't lie
I'm on one, girl I can't lie
Geeked up in the club, baby, we so high!
Gucci!

[Gucci Mane]
I'm up in the club dogg, you don't wanna get none
Party pack of pills, man I gave your bitch another one
She took another one, ? getting dumber son
Put around a rubberband, tossed it to my brother's son
Gucci going half dogg, nigga you can smell me
Ajax nigga, what a playa ain't gon tell me?

Stellar Chevy rims on some skinny-ass tires
Call it G.B.D. chores, getting brain while I drive
Stellar Chevy rims on some skinny-ass tiresI'm trying to save us girl.....
They got that...
They got that kryptonite...

[Verse 1:]
It seems the more I try to do right
The more I lie about being at sessions and leaving at certain times
She's like, "Where you at?"
I'm at the studio at home
And I'm thinking to myself we cut that record days ago
Cause shorty on the east side, hit me and want to know if I could stop by
Now I'm contemplating what I am gonna say, bout this being the umpteenth time that Im late

[Hook:]
I wanna be your superman
I'm trying to save our love the best way that I can
Cause these girls they're like kryptonite
These girls my kryptonite
These girls got kryptonite
These girls my kryptonite
And I really wanna make it work, but I can't stop messing round
I'm here doing dirt
Cause these girls they're like kryptonite
These girls my kryptonite
These girls got kryptonite
These girls my kryptonite
Oh baby

[Verse 2:]
It's like the more I brush them off, the more they call
The more I want to tell them that I'm not in love
With anyone, when I know it's you
Wanna tell the truth but it's just so hard to do
Caught up in me again it's driving me crazy
It's the reason I won't tell em I got a lady
Now I'm trying to contemplate on what I am gonna say, on this being the umpteenth time that Im late

[Bridge:]
No matter what I do, I know that your my true love
But I just can't help it to get caught up with all these broads
Sitting here with this mic in my hand
Trying to record the words to make my baby understand

[Hook:]
I wanna be your superman
I'm trying to save our love the best way that I can
Cause these girls they're like kryptonite
These girls my kryptonite
These girls got kryptonite
These girls my kryptonite

And I really wanna make it work, but I can't stop messing round
I'm here doing dirt
Cause these girls they're like kryptonite
These girls my kryptonite
These girls got kryptonite
These girls my kryptonite
Oh baby

[Verse 3:]
I want you to be my lois lane
Girl I promise I'm gonna change, and it ain't gonna be this way forever
Girl I'm gonna get myself together, cause your the one I love
Because your like a drug that I can't get enough of
I'm just so confused, dont know what to do
Cause the way that it's feeling, I like how it's feeling
It's getting so hard, to fight that feeling

[Rich Boy Rap]
I'm a rich boy riding wit my bitch, superstar shit
The one girls try to get they text me on my sidekick
Bring em to my palace, tell em take it off we make a flick
Every night I do it so at least one chick I gotta get
Just like kryptonite them girls make me super weak
Suck my dick and play with me until they put me straight to sleep
Twenty girls on my sheets, seven days out the week
It's hard trying to hold it down with groupies trying to get with me
I stay dreaming, fantasizing, with my eyes closed
I love you girl but I'm addicted to them hoes
If ballin is a sin then God please forgive me
My women so bad and my money so filthy really
[Hook:]
I wanna be your superman
I'm trying to save our love the best way that I can
Cause these girls they're like kryptonite
These girls my kryptonite
These girls got kryptonite
These girls my kryptonite
And I really wanna make it work, but I can't stop messing round
I'm here doing dirt
Cause these girls they're like kryptonite

[Verse 1]
R.I.P. Pooh Bear, that's my dead homie
Fuck that other shit, hey, let's get this bread homie
Remember when they could catch a charge down in Atlanta
They underestimate me cause I'm comin' from Alabama
Martin Lee Anderson he ain't even have a chance
They beat him in that boot camp 'til he died in that ambulance
That boy was only fifteen years old, fuck what they say he did
So tell me how I'm 'posed to feel when police killin' kids?
And then we can't get a job, ridin' we get them pounds
If it ain't that coke then we get that 'dro and break it down
See that ice, the dope man paradise
Boy better think twice, that dope have you doin' life
They tore down the projects, so where we gon' move next?
They takin' them food stamps, they stop government checks
Hey, money my motivator, my mouth my money maker
Naw I don't see them haters, so let's go get this paper

[Bridge 1]
Yeah when you look at us just think about it, we don't own nothin'
If we get money, we got a lil' few dollars, but our whole family tore up nigga
You gettin' money for the people in ya family that ain't got nothin'
When it's all said and done, what do you own? You don't own nothin', you
Don't own you... The nigga playin' basketball, he don't own that jersey, he can't
Even be in a commercial wit' his name on the back, so when it's really all
Said and done, what did you do this for? What difference did you make?

[Verse 2]
You see how the world changin'? Yeah, they left Saddam hangin'
Wish they just kill 'em all so now the Middle East they bangin'
Preachers in that pulpit, say they teach that bullshit
So know how we know it's bullshit? Same niggas I went to school wit'
Grabbin' on yo' nuts and disrespectin' get you merked
Them young niggas got pistol grips, they been about they killin' shit
But they all some hypocrites, haters they won't let me be
When I come up to them gates, I hope you say you heard of me
Now Kendrick Curtis gone, them angels took him home
They gave my brother ten years, the system did him wrong
Now we convicted felons, because they caught us sellin'
And nine times out of ten yo' friend the one who tellin'
I wanna go to Heaven, up to that Promised Land
I need another chance, I wanna meet that man
Money my motivator, my mouth my money maker
No I don't see you haters, so let's go get this paper

[Bridge 2 - Polow Da Don]
Yeah! Surprise niggas! Hey we ??? nigga! Everybody talkin' 'bout they gettin'
Money... Y'all niggas ain't gettin' no muthafuckin' money nigga! I got
Millions nigga and I'm still broke nigga cause that ain't no mutafuckin' money!

[Verse 3]
They shippin' them boys off, they fightin' in Iraq
It's soldiers in that war that ain't never gon' make it back
Niggas this the battlefield, fake niggas scream keep it real
Yeah yeah, rob, steal, anything to pay them bills
Hey nigga times harder, so we grind harder
We takin' chances wit' that coke comin' 'cross that water
Tryin' to get up out this ghetto life ain't gotta be this way
Them pigs they came and kicked my mama do' in yesterday
I prayed a thousand nights, I did a hundred crimes
And now I'm beggin' Lord that you don't let me down this time
Money my motivator, my mouth my money maker
No I don't see them haters, so let's go get this paper

[Bridge 3 - Rich Boy]

[Intro]
I've got it made thats what I'm talking about
Going down to the fashion store and get myself fitted out
Going down to the dealers buy myself a brand new car
So me and my lady can ride

[Verse 1: Drake]
Check, I wish y'all coulda seen me back in high school, backpack
Grey range black Ac'
Put a half a stack out just to get a stack back
Double that school dance, Fresh J's, new pants
Back when "fuck bitches, get money" was the new chant
It started out a boy like Hugh Grant
Now I'm a young man doin things you can't
But you can't call me Champagne Charlie
I campaign hardly
My damn chain glitter ruby red
The type of shit that leave your hand stained scarlet
I live it, thought you knew this
I swear that we been through this
Your boyfriends future plans got 'em on todays to-do list
Cause he rollin wit more squares then you would find up on a rubix
Bingo, money ain't a thing ho
That prometh with that sprite and jolly rancher so flamingo
I ain't speaking in code real niggas they know the lingo
Cause when I'm in the spot it's popping like Christopher's single

[Hook]
If ya'll dont like me then (you must hate money, money)
Guaranteed if you had it to spare you could probably comprehend im just sayin man (you must hate money, money)
They be gettin jealous when you paid, savin everything they made, I keep thnkin that (you must hate money, money)
Telling people my image is lame, and im whats wrong with the game, but im feelin like (you must hate money, money)
Considering everywhere I go got couple grand to blow man you know

[Verse 2: Rich Boy]
Hey, I'm flyer then a motherfucker
Haters wanna see me dead like John Tucker(so)
I'm in that big boy 550 s-class
I hit the gas and watch them hoes waving through the glass
Pimp glass im riding new in 2008 (say what)
I hit them hoes and send em home, you take em on a date
That white gucci ticker let em know there's money here
I grip the cline and sit on seats thats made of cashmere
5 karats in my ear, you see them hoes jock?
Bitch theres a whole lota rocks up in this powder watch
I'm writin letters to the pen for my brother irving
Send him a picture of that drop with me in it swervin
Hotter than a bitch rock, Cooler than some ice cream
Gotta feed myself I'm up here living in a dream
My cadillac mean but my 88 a beast
If bein fly against the law bitch call the po-lice

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Drake]
Stacks on deck, lac's mounted on D's
I dont trust you so make sure you count it all please
And once its all there, then that put me at ease
And these niggas just mad cause they account is on freeze
Baby pay attention please, I'm more coordinated then a dance team
Its my turn, my turn like advance green
My true religion is money, check out the pant seams
I got cash in my palm I call it hand cream
And I just want the paper
My momma trying to go to rome and I just wanna take her
Im tryin to figure what the los angle is like a laker
So I can be on beaches with my niggas in jamaica
I say 'baby get low', You just getting by
They hating cause my swagger at a all time high
Shit its a damn shame homie I dont even try
Get money mofo is all you hear me reply

[Hook][Produced by Hit-Boy]

[Intro]
(Who the Plug?) We the Plug
(Who the Plug?) We the Plug
(Who the Plug?) We the Plug
Nigga, HS87

[Hook: Rich Boy]
Can't you see I've been through shit? I don't wanna talk
I give a fuck bout what you speak about
I came with my crew bitch, we ain't gotta talk
We give a fuck 'bout what you speak about
Cause nigga, this that new shit, bring the speakers out
And I give a fuck 'bout what you speak about
Cause nigga, you don't do shit, you are not involved
I'm that nigga that you gotta call

[Verse 1: Hit-Boy & Rich Boy]
[Hit-Boy]
Used to just want in, now we want it all
That's my corner, aw that's my section, we gon pop it off
Me and all my niggas, they want us Black Robbed
But fuck it, I'm on my job

[Rich Boy]
A nigga used to pull up in that Lex like (whoa)
Tryna tell these niggas I was next like (whoa)
Next move be my best, finna flex like (whoa)
Break bread with my niggas and invest like (whoa)

[Hit-Boy]
Aight I'm bout to get it going
Bring em out, let's get it started
Turn Southern California, rep the coast and I put on for mine
Came up in the tow, made my first beat in the Meadowlands
12 years later, watched a motion picture telecast
Nigga major moves, major moves
I paid my dues, this summer we ain't finna say we finna make due
We the new take crew, that's we, that's us
A hundred million on my mind, giving zero fucks

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Hit-Boy]
I never switch
My beats be feeling like Kurt Angle in this bitch
Fuck a list, I got the angle better than it has ever been
Missed a couple Sundays in that C.O.G.I.C., this my testament
Change up the flow, yeah I change up the flow
I pitch change ups, I mastered at exchanging hoes
In a nation of clones, I'm that real nigga that stand out
Tryna outlast, nigga I done smoked my last ounce
Product of mid 90s, Daytonas and big bodies
I was in that SS, now that stand for show stopper
Similar to phone foes hoppin', bitch I got that bounce
Took my circle to the top, like a fucking button down

[Hook]

[Outro: PeeJ]
While you've been tryna get it and still ain't got it yet
Oh nigga, I've made more moves and not announcements
I said while you've been trying to get it and still ain't got it yet
I been making moves and not announcements
I had to think about it
I never talked about it
But you can think about it
Hey, I've always been about it
So you can think about it

[Hit-Boy] (Try to remake that ho][Verse 1]
I fly like paper, get high like planes
[If you catch me at the border I got visas in my name
If you come around here, I make 'em all day
I get one done in a second if you wait [x2]

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I think sittin' on trains
Every stop I get to I'm clocking that game
Everyone's a winner we're making our fame
Bonafide hustler making my name [x2]

[Hook]
All I wanna do is *Bang Bang Bang Bang*
And *Click* *Ka-Ching*
And take your money [x4]

[Verse 3: Bun B]
Man I'm rollin' through the city, old school on them big boys
12 inch woofers in the trunk making big noise
Got the big toys (toys), dont make me have to flash
Let a hundred rounds go, you do a hundred yard dash
Back up in the hood where the rules dont shift
And the gangstas talk trills, sip purp and burn piff
You can call 5-0 and 5-0 might come
But by the time that they arrive all that dirt had been done
Now one things for certain, and two things for sure
Being poor is a disease, gotta hustle up a cure
Start with your head homie then use your hands
If you try it in reverse, you dont even have a chance
We worldwide worried with the hunger and the thirst
From the third world countries to the second and the first
It sounds like a verse but its more like a plan
Get your Robin Hood on, put some pressure on the man, tell it!

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Rich Boy]
I wake up in the morning with my bitch in the bed
She don't like the police and she sure hate the feds
I love my girl cause she gives me what I want
She ride in the trunk or either ride in the front
She looks like 22 but she really 45
Some reason she done made a whole lotta niggas cry
So bad that she make ‘em all pull they money out
Take it out they pockets and they put it in my pouch
Ouch! gotta hurt the way that girl do ya
She always wanna what take, take, take the moolah
Gimmie them pesos the cash and the credit card
Might be a broad but the lil' bitch hit ya hard
You the police and we is the robbers
You need more than them helicopters to stop us
Excuse me, let me introduce my lady
Her name is Beretta and she mothafuckin crazy!
