[Intro]
Yeah, clear enough for ya?
Why you niggas look mad?
Y'all supposed to be happy I'm free!
Y'all niggas look like y'all wanted me to stay in jail
Ho bustas!

[Verse 1]
Picture me rolling in my 500 Benz
I got no love for these niggas, there's no need to be friends
They got me under surveillance, that's what somebody be telling
Know there's dope being sold, but I ain't the one selling!
Don't want to be another number
I gotta puff a gang of weed to keep from going under
The federales wanna see me dead - niggas put prices on my head
Now I got two Rottweilers by me bed, I feed em lead
Now I'm released, how will I live? Will God forgive me
For all the dirt a nigga did, to feed kids?
One life to live, it's so hard to be positive
When niggas shooting at your crib
Mama, I'm still thugging, the world is a war zone
My homies is inmates, and most of them dead wrong
Full grown, finally a man, just scheming on ways
To put some green inside the palms of my empty hands
Just picture me rollin'
Flossing a Benz on rims that isn't stolen
My dreams is censored, my hopes are gone
I'm like a fiend that finally sees when all the dope is gone
My nerves is wrecked, heart beating and my hands are swollen
Thinking of the G's I'll be holdin', picture me rollin'

[Interlude]
Can you see me now?
Move to the side a little bit so you can get a clear picture
Can you see it?
Pictue me rollin
Yeah nigga!
Ay, but peep how my nigga Syke do it to you
Guess who's back?

[Verse 2: Syke]
I got keys coming from overseas
Cost a nigga 200 G's
I'm a street commando, Nino for example
This lavish lifestyle is hard to handle
So I got to floss cause I'm more like a boss player
Thug, branded to be a women-layer
So many player haters, imitators steady swanging
Make me wanna start back banging
So I'm caught up in the game, dress code changed
Packing 40 Glocks, contain em or rearrange
All that jealousy and envy coming from my enemies
While I'm sipping on Remy
In front of black Lexus, Chevy's on the roam
'96 big body, sitting on chrome
As we head up out the zone, stone-facing is on
You can admire, but don't look too long
I'm living a dream with triple beams and my pockets bulgin
It's hard to imagine -- picture me rollin!

[CPO]
I gots to get the fuck up in it, formulate a caper
Cause a nigga straight suffering from lack of having paper
My bitch fin' to have a bastard, see?
So I needs to hit a lick, drastically
I see some ballin' ass niggas, and they slippin' in my spot
And, uh, diggin the plots (so what?)
Checking in the park, 'Pac

[2Pac]
We caught em sleeping, he didn't peep you niggas creeping?
This how we do it every weekend
I dump for madness, it's time to count the profit
CPO, we got the bomb spot, nigga time to clock it
I get the liquor, and you could get the females
This crooked shit that we inflicting getting street sales!

[CPO]
Move smooth as a motherfucker, me and my 9
I'm as cool as a motherfucker: I'mma get mine
Now we satisfied, got the pockets on swollen
Boss Hog and this 'Pac nigga: picture us rollin

[Outro - 2Pac]
Is y'all ready for me?
Picture me rollin roll call
You know there's some muh'fuckers out there
I just could not forget about
I wanna make sure they can see me
Number one on my list: Clinton Correctional Facilities
All you bitch ass C.O.'s
Can you niggas see me from there?
Ballin on y'all punk ass!
Picture me rollin, baby
Yeah, all them niggas up in them cell blocks
I told y'all niggas when I come home it's on
That's right nigga, picture me rollin
Oh, I forgot! The D.A
Yeah, that bitch had a lot to talk about in court
Can the ho see me from here?
Can you see me, ho?
Picture me rollin
And all you punk police -- can you see me?
Am I clear to you?
Picture me rollin' nigga, legit
Free like O.J. all day
You can't stop me
You know I got my niggas up in this motherfucker
Manute, Pain, Syke, [Bogart?], Mopreme
It's sad dog, can you picture us rolling?
Can you see me ho?
Is y'all ready for me? .. We up out this bitch
Any time y'all wanna see me again
Rewind this track right here, close your eyes
And picture me rollin[2Pac]
How long will they mourn me?
Yeah! This for my nigga Kato, it's still on nigga - believe that
We live a Thug Life, Thugs for Life, ha ha
(How long will they mourn me?) We handle this shit for you bwoy
Yeah nigga.. 2Pac in this motherfucker

All my homies drinkin' liquor, tears in everybody's eyes
Niggas cried, to mourn a homie's homicide
But I can't cry, instead I'm just a shoulder
Damn, why they take another soldier?
I load my clip before my eyes blurry, don't worry
I'll get them suckers back before you're buried (shit)
Retaliate and pull a one-eight-seven
Do real niggas get to go to heaven?
How long will they mourn me? Bury me a motherfuckin' G
Bitch don't wanna die; then, don't fuck with me
It's kinda hard to be optimistic
When your homie's lyin' dead on the pavement twisted
Y'all don't hear me doe, I'm tryin hard to make amends
But I'm losin' all my motherfuckin' friends.. damn!
They should've shot me when I was born
Now I'm trapped in the motherfuckin' storm
How long will they mourn me?

[Hook: Nate Dogg + 2Pac]
[Nate] I wish it would have been another
[2Pac] How long will they mourn me?
[Nate] How long.. will they mourn.. my brother
(Half them niggas all dead and shit)
[2Pac] How long will they mourn me?
[Nate] I wish it would have been another
(Dedicated this to Kato nigga, and e'ry thug)
[2Pac] How long will they mourn me?
[Nate] How long.. will they mourn.. my brother
(Yo nigga, we gotta keep this shit goin' on, yo Syke)

[Big Syke]
How long will they mourn me? Every motherfuckin' day homie
You stayed down when the other niggas didn't know me
From my heart to the trigger you my fuckin' nigga
And things won't be the same without ya nigga
I remember kickin' back, you wanted a 'llac
And goin' half on a motherfuckin' hundred sack
Smokin' blunt after blunt, and steady drinkin'
Hung around so much, you knew what I was thinkin'
Tell me Lord, why you take big Kato?
So confused not knowing which way to go
I'm goin' crazy and runnin' out of fuckin' time
I can't take it, I'm losin' my fuckin' mind
So day after day, ride after ride
We'll hook up on the other side
Watch over your family and your newborn
Till we meet again homie - how long will they mourn me?

[Hook: Nate Dogg + Big Syke]
[Nate] I wish it would have been another (Big Kato)
[Syke] How long will they mourn me? (It's still on nigga)
[Nate] How long.. will they mourn.. my brother
[Syke] How long will they mourn me?
[Nate] I wish it would have been another (Yeah)
[Syke] How long will they mourn me?
[Nate] How long.. will they mourn.. my brother
[Syke] Rated R (Double Jeapordy) Mac 10

[The Rated R]
Damn, a nigga tired of feelin' sad, I'm tired of puttin' in work
I'm tired of cryin' watchin' my homies leave the - earth
I know soon one day I'll be in the dirt
And my peoples'll be mournin', when they get a call from the coroner
All niggas can say is that's fucked up
And get tossed up, reminiscin' how we grew up (my nigga)
Rest and love to my nigga Kato, see you in the crossroads real soon
For now let me pour out some brew
I'll be always thinkin' of ya homie
Rest in peace.. how long will they mourn me?

[Macadoshis/"Mac 10"]
We know life's a fuckin' trip, and everybody gotta go
But why the fuck it have to be my nigga Kato?
Another nigga fell victim to the chrome
It's enough to make you crazy, it's fuckin with my dome
Ya only live once on this earth
A nigga had it bad, since the day, of my motherfuckin' birth (uh)
But niggas say they down and they always be my homie
But when a nigga gone, how long will ya mourn me? (YEAH!)

[Hook: Nate Dogg + 2Pac]
[Nate] I wish it would have been another
(Mac 10 in this motherfucker, yeah!)
[2Pac] How long will you mourn me?!
[Nate] How long.. will they mourn.. my brother
(Thug Life boy, Nate, blowin that shit)
[Nate] I wish it would have been another
(Nate Dogg do that shit nigga, yeah)
[2Pac] How long will you mourn me?!
[Nate] How long.. will they mourn.. my brother
(This for my nigga Kato, and all his kids)
[2Pac] How long will you mourn me?!
[Nate] I wish it would have been another
[Nate] How long.. will they mourn.. my brother

{*fades out*}[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Thinking back, reminiscing on my teens
A young G getting paid over dope fiends
Fucking off cash that I made
Nigga, what's the sense of working hard if you never get to play
I'm hustling, staying out till it's dawn
And coming home at 6 o'Clock in the morning
Hand's on my Glock, eyes on the prize
Finger on the trigger when a nigga ride
Shooting craps, busting niggas out the door
Pick my money off the floor, God bless the tre-four
Stuck on full, drunk again
Sipping on gin with a couple of friends
Say them Thug Life niggas be like major pimps
Sticking to the rules was a major sin
And if I die, let it be
But when it come for me, bury me a G

[Chorus x2: 2Pac]
I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my motherfucking riches
Even when I die, they won't worry me
Mama don't cry, bury me a G

Verse 2: [Mopreme]
More trouble than the average
Just made 25 and I'm living like a savage
Being a G, it ain't no easy thing
Cause you could fuck around, get crossed and get stuck in the game
And for the rest of your life you will sit and reminisce
Wonder why it had to end like this
And to the G's you can feel my pain
Until the motherfucker gets born again

[Verse 3: Rated R]
You thought it was a game kid, I'm not the nigga for playing game
I let my buckshots ring when I pull the trigger on my gauge
I'm on the rampage making runs for the Devil
Ain't nothing on my mind will get me into trouble
I'm tryna ride no more loves for me hard to figure
Get a nigga, smoke a blunt or it's a jury starts (Break yo self)
I gives a fuck nigga stuck outta luck when I bust
Pull me to my death but I'm a G to the enemy

[Hook x2]

[Verse 4: Big Syke]
I got nothing to lose so I choose to be a killer
Went from banging to slanging, now I'm a dope dealer
All my life paid the price to be the boss
Back to school, broke the rules on getting tossed
Popping rocks on the block was a past time
Pack a .9 all the time, you wanna test mine?
Don't cry, I die before they play me
From the cradle to the grave, bury me G

[Verse 5: Macadoshis]
Straight thug kicking it with the homies in the hood
Getting drunk, smoking blunts, my bitch said I'm no good
I gives a fuck I spend my time in the dope spot
Never had no time for no bitch instead slanging rocks
And busting caps on you punk ass marks
Fake ass G's, bitch niggas with no heart
I'm staying real till I'm 6 feet deep
So when a nigga gone, just bury me a G

[Hook x2]

[2Pac]
Stuck on full, Tanqueray got a nigga high
Lord knows I don't need another DUI
I led a Thug Life, heartless hustler
Just cause I fuck don't mean I trust her
Now my pagers vibrating, can't sleep
So I'm mobbing to the ho's house, bumping Isley
"Is it cool to fuck?" Is what I'm asking
Bitch recognize game and started laughing
Now I'm all in those guts and shit
Praying that a nigga don't nut too quick
Cause I'll fuck and get up, I'll let you know
I'll be a 10 minute brother for a $2 ho
Lots of ho's get mad and shit
I let a trick be a trick, you can have that bitch
Cause I doubt if I change, the game's a motherfucker
Real niggas turn to busters, Bury Me a G

[Hook x6][Intro]
From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto
From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
June 16th, 1971
Mama gave birth to a Hell-raising heavenly son
See the doctor tried to smack me but I smacked him back
My first words was, "Thug for life" and "Papa, pass the MAC"
I'm busting on these motherfuckers balling
Listen you can hear my mini fourteen calling
From out the window of my drop top, I got my Glock cocked
Busting at niggas, when will it stop?
Now tell me are you scared of the dark? Can't close my eyes I see visions
And even with this thug living will I escape prison?
Penitentiary chances was an all day thang
The only way to advance; and if you slang
Then you'd better have yo' Nikes on
Cause when we fight it's in the middle of the night with no lights on, hey!!
There must be a God cause I feel lucky
Paranoid out my mind cause motherfuckers tryna rush me
Am I going to jail? Look at me bailing
Coming out the court house, all about my mail and bank
Never, never die I'll be a hustler, motherfuckers
And making thugs out you suckers from the cradle to the grave

[Hook]
From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto

[Verse 2: Mopreme]
From the cradle to the grave since a little bitty child
I've been known to get ill and kinda buck wild
Pop pop! Just like the part that's in my walk with street talk
I'm running up the block in the dark where lead spark
Surveillance on a nigga every day
Waiting on my daddy just to take his ass away
Now Mama always working tryna make ends meet
So now a young nigga's being raised by the streets
And then the only other one that ever showed me love
Was my dope fiend uncle strung out on drugs
A straight thug, just me, my mama out here on our own
So I got two gats,one black and one of chrome
Now I don't wanna hurt nobody but I must defend mine!
It's all the fuck I got, so stop and walk a thin line
Young niggas be brave
And keep on thugging from the cradle to the grave
From the cradle to the grave

[Hook]
From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto

[Verse 3: The Rated R]
From the cradle to the grave, I'm glad to say, I made it this far
Many G's died hogs and all they got was they name hit up on a wall
It's sad thinking about the times
Life goes on, I'm steady lost in this land
That's the war zone, I gots no home, don't have no friends neither
It's just me by my lonely so I married my Nina
I keeps her wherever I go, I love my ho
Never leave home with out my sugar, I'm have to plug a nigga
Mama told me not to trust no punks
And kick his ass if he lay a hand on me since then I been knowing
Sometimes I think my own self stupid
Cause I stay shooting at marks, get twisted up in police reports
Since the cradle, I've been ungrateful
My first toy was a gun I got sprung and learned to love weapons
But now I'm through with money, and through with street fame
Somebody peeled my cap, and put me in my grave

[Hook] (x2)
From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy
Livin in the ghetto

[Verse 4: Macadoshis]
March 18th, a rainy day my mama gave birth
To a baby boy trapped in hell on Earth
From day one it wasn't fun I never had a crumb
Daddy worked two jobs and Mama won't stop drinkin rum
I tried to cope loc, but my family's broke
And my pocket's short so now I got ta slang dope
In the game filled with pain it's a fuckin shame
The white man got a motherfucker slangin 'caine
So now it's on from dusk to dawn I'm gettin my serve on
Always in the spot with my Glock slingin rocks at the Rox
The shit don't stop, I'm steady dodgin cops
I never flip-flop, hear my Glock cock, thug 'til I drop
And if I hit the pen I gotta do my time
Sittin on my bunk reminiscin bout the good times
It's fucked up a nigga gotta grow up doin dirt
But from the cradle to the grave I'mma put in work

[Hook] (x2)
From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy
Livin in the ghetto

[Verse 5: Big Syke]
Time's movin fast, will I last another day?
So I pray and I lay with my A-K
Did I sell my soul as a young kid?
All the things I did wishin someone held me but they never did
I can't take it, will I make it to my older age?
Before I'm shot up or locked up in a fuckin cage
Lord help me, guide me, save me!
Cause that's the way that Daddy raised me, crazy
Do or die, nigga pull the trigger don't give a fuck
You'd rather be in jail than get yo' ass bucked
Nobody cares, it's me against the world
Keepin murder on my mind and my tec-9
I got nothin to lose, payin dues, nigga you wanna die?
I get high and then my mission is a walk-by
You'd better jet when I hit your set cause I'm comin
Start runnin yellin "evil mind" as I'm gunnin
One in the chamber for the anger that I build inside
For the mothers that cried, for my homies that died
The beginning is an ending, am I just a slave?
So I got to be brave from the cradle to the grave

[Hook] (x2)
From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy
Livin in the ghetto

*fading out*[2Pac] I don't know why I be fuckin witchu

[Verse One: 2Pac]
Was it the liquor, that makes me act blind, times that I'm with her
Anonymous pictures of other niggas tryin to kiss her
Will I love her or shall I diss her?
I'm sick of this scandalous shit I deal wit
Tryin to paint a perfect picture
My memories of jealousy no longer carefree
Cause so much bullshit your girlfriends keep tellin me
I'm on tour, but now my bedroom's an open door
So it got me thinkin, what am I tryin for?
When I was young I was so very dumb, eager to please
A lil', trick on a mission tryin to get in my P's
Me and my niggas is thug niggas, former known drug dealers
We don't love bitches and believe, they don't love niggas
I gotta blame my attraction
But you became a distraction, a threat to my paper stackin
I thought you changed but now I know
Can't turn a ho into a housewife, baby, and there you go

[Hook: Jazze Pha]
Baby there you go, actin like a ho
There you there you go, actin like a ho
Baby there you go, actin like a ho
Actin like a ho, actin like a ho
HOE! See the word on the streets you're a
HOE! Just a groupie on a world tour
HOE! Now I found out for myself you're a
HOE! Girl you need to check yourself

[Verse Two: Kastro]
These silly bitches got this game twisted
So I don't claim 'em, just bang 'em
Papa raised a player, so player, I play 'em
I got hoes that got more, hoes than me
So how I look, gettin hooked, like I ain't got G?
Truly cutie booty big, but that ain't enough
And the head make me beg, still that just ain't enough
When I don't trust her, the bitch be lyin too much
When she be dyin to fuck me you be buyin her stuff, ho

[Verse Three: Kadafi]
See girlfriend I know, your whole M.O.'s preoccupied with mostly
Gettin clown after clown, town coast to coast - see
I been tryin to stay away from sluts like you
Got me turned off completely by that sheisty shit that you do
Knew from jump yo' aim, straight through them spandex, don't front
Just name, spots on yo' body for me to touch while you clutch this game
I keep flowin like H20 it ain't nuthin for me to say
Why you keep actin like a ho? But there you go

[Hook]

[Verse Four: Young Noble]
Uhh, when I first met her I told her I was busy all the time
Now she, callin me flippin like she miss me all the time
How she, don't even trip she got a man at home
You need to stop chasin dick bitch and raise your son
I'm like - damn, we can creep sometime
And you know I'm on the road for like weeks at a time
Girl you're thirsty; and stop callin while I'm workin you hurtin me
All this bullshit is irkin me girl, but there you go

[Verse Five: Big Syke - last few words of each line repeat]
I blame it on yo' momma, she need to holla at you
But should I blame it on yo' daddy for all the things that you do
Cause there you go, just like a ho, caught in the streets
Like givin yo' number out to every nigga you meet
I'm tired of the games you playin, so stop playin (ho)
You hear what I'm sayin, you only good for parlayin
I'm layin down the rules, this a game that you lose
So the streets can have you baby cause I stay on the move
(There you goooo)

[Hook] w/ ad libs

[Outro: 2Pac]
There you go baby girl, THAT'S the story
There you MOTHERFUCKIN go
I coulda SWORE you told me you was gon' change
And you don't wanna go to clubs no more and
You wasn't fin' to dress all crazy no more and
You was gon' stay home and try to chill
What happened baby?
Ohh, so yo' FRIEND wanted to go out
That wasn't you that went out
You was just goin out cause yo' friend was
Okay, so you was pissy drunk up in that nigga car
Cause yo' FRIEND wanted to get drunk huh?
It's all good, cause there you go baby
Oh I ain't trippin on them niggas callin the house
It's all good, cause there you go
Me I'mma still be a player, all day baby
So uhh, there you go

[Hook] - fades out[Intro]
Uhh.. dear Mr. President
What's happening?
I'm writin' you because, shit is still real fucked up in my neighborhood
Pretty much the same way, right around the time when you got elected
Ain't nothin' changed
All the promises you made, before you got elected..
.. they ain't came true

[2Pac]
Tell me what to do, these niggas actin up in the hood
Send mo' troops, dear Mr. President
(Me and my homies is wonderin' what's goin' on.. holla!)
Tell me what to do, these niggas actin up in the hood
Send mo' troops..

Why should I lie, when I can dramatize?
Niggas fell victim to my lyrics, now traumatized
Simply by spittin' I've been blessed given riches, enemies suspicious
Cause I'm seldom in the company of bitches
Plus the concepts I depict, so visual, that you can kiss
Each and every trick or bitch, inside the shit I kick
My heaviest words'll move a mountain
Casualties in mass amounts, brothers keep countin'
Fuck the friendships, I ride alone
Destination Death Row, finally found a home
Plus all my homies wanna die, call it euthanasia
Dear Lord, look how sick this ghetto made us, sincerely
Yours I'm a thug, the product of a broken home
Everybody's doped up, nigga what you smokin' on?
Figure if we high they can train us
But then America fucked up and blamed us
I guess it's cause we black that we targets
My only fear is God, I spit that hard shit
In case you don't know, I let my pump go
Get it ride for Mutulu like I ride for Geronimo
Down to die, for everything I represent
Meant every word, in my letter to the President

Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
(What should I do?)
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin up in the hood, send mo' troops

[E.D.I. Amin]
Oh you's a baller in the White House, I hope you comfortable
Cause yo I spend my nights out, with the lights out
Under the safety of darkness, amongst the crazed and the heartless
And young soul bros, ready to rode a starship
Launch it, leave a nigga flat for scratch, the Godless
I gotta get chips, but you can't understand that
Wanna ban rap? Stand back, before you get hurt
It's the only thing makin' pay besides smoke and work
On a mission listen more chips my goal and position
First on my decision I realized the same nigga
Trippin' to drastic measures tryin' to get stacks of cheddar
Muh'fuckers hate cops, wait it ain't gettin' better
But you keep, tellin' us, that it is
While your motherfuckin' troops keep killin' our kids, dig
Don't be surprised if you see us
Dumpin with nuttin but artillery to free us, motherfucker

Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin up in the hood, send mo' troops

[Kastro]
Strapped and angry, with no hope and heartbroke
Fightin' first my trained brain until it's not so
It's hostile, niggas lick shots to watch the Glocks glow
Cadres of coppers patrol us like we some animals
And it ain't no peace, my peace a piece on my streets
To people beefin' and things, squeakin' on they beefs for weeks
Mr. President, it's evident, nobody really care
For a struggler out the gutter, twenty-two with gray hair
I was raised to raise hell, frail and my heart stale
So I'mma bring hell to earth until my heart fail
But y'all play fair, give me and mine, I'll share
Til y'all show us you care, it's gon' be mayhem out here
Me and these 223's will freeze the biggest with ease
I'm still a nigga you fear, bring the beast to his knees
And I've been born to represent, for that I've been heaven sent
And I meant, every word, in my letter, to the President

Shit is still fucked up y'all
And y'all wonder when it's gon' get better
And it ain't gon' get better

[2Pac]
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin up..

Heavenly Father may I holla at you briefly
I wanna meet the President, but will he meet me?
Is he scared to look inside the eyes of a Thug Nigga?
We tired of bein' scapegoats for this capitalistic drug dealin'
How hypocritical is Liberty?
That blind bitch ain't never did shit for me
My history, full of casket and scars
My own black nation at war, whole family behind bars
And they wonder why we scarred, thirteen lookin' hard
Sister had a baby as an adolescent, where was God?
Somewhere in the middle of my mind
Is a nigga on the tightrope, screamin' let him die
Can't lie I'm a thug, drownin' in my own blood
Lookin' for the reason that my momma's strung out on drugs
Down to die, for everything I represent
Meant every word, in my letter to the President

[Big Syke]
Blacks is broke, think it's a joke that we livin' low?
Y'all sniffin' blow and postin' what they hittin' fo'?
Tell the secretary it's necessary we get paid
Look what you made, little kids gettin' sprayed
Day after day, and night after night
Battles and wars to the daylight
We might change and rearrange if you do somethin'
Till then we gonna keep it comin', Mr. President
And I meant every word in my letter to the President

[2Pac]
Word motherfuckin' life
Fuck this nigga think?
Cuttin' taxes, takin' off welfare
We 'sposed to just sit here, go broke and die, starvin'?
Motherfuckers crazy in their motherfuckin’ scalp
Nigga this Thug Life, Westside Outlaw Immortalz nigga
We fin' to hustle till we come up

Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin up in the hood, send mo' troops

Dear Mr. Clinton, shit
It's gettin' harder and harder for a motherfucker
To make a dollar in these here streets
I mean shit, I hear you screamin' peace
But we can't find peace
Til my little niggas on these streets get a piece
I know you feel me cause you too near me not to hear me
So why don't you help a nigga out?
Sayin you cuttin' welfare
That got us niggas on the street, thinkin' who in the hell care?
Shit, y'all want us to put down our Glocks and our rocks
But y'all ain't ready to give us no motherfuckin' dollars
What happened to our 40 acres and a mule fool?
We ain't stupid
Think you got us lookin' to lose
Tryin' to turn all us young niggas into troops
You want us to fight your war
What the fuck I'm fightin for?
Shit, I ain't got no love here
I ain't had a check all year
Taxin, all the blacks and
Police beatin' me in the streets
Fuck peace

These niggas actin up in the hood, send mo' troops[2Pac]
I was so money orientated, initiated as a thug
Fiendin' for wicked adventures, ambitious as I was
Picture a nigga on the verge of livin' insane
I sold my soul for a chance to kick it and bang
Now tell if I'm wrong
But sayin' "Fuck the world" got you deeper in my songs
Drinkin' 'til I earl, spendin' money 'til it's gone
It's the good life - maybe niggas got it goin' on
Now maybe if I died, and came back, wouldn't have to slang crack
Addicted to the game, so obviously we came strapped
Please forgive me for my wicked ways, fuck a bitch
Bad Boy niggas eat a dick a day, bumpin' this
Lord have mercy it's a slaughter
So wicked that my tracks is wettin' niggas like it's water
I learned my lessons as a thug in these wicked ass hood fights
But I'm a baller now, nigga, I live the good life

[Hook]
This is the good life, fuck my foes
God bless the dumb niggas that, trust them hoes
Found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
And live the good life, cause thug niggas don't die
We live the good life, fuck my foes
God bless the dumb niggas that, trust these hoes
Found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
And live the good life, cause thug niggas don't die

[Big Syke]
No one knows what the, future holds, but you
Haha.. listen close
They say reach in yo' heart and you'll find your mind
Every day in the streets, got my foresight blind
My after time is narrow, peepin down the barrel of a foe
Just a nigga or a killer I don't know so
Who makes the call will I fall a victim like the rest?
Slug in the chest, one in the dome and make sure I'm gone
Send me home all alone in these cold streets
In desperation constantly drinkin and I can't sleep
Neck deep strugglin tryin to survive
Some wanna die I wanna stay alive, eyes on the prize
Let me modify this whole region
I declare this sucker duckin' season, give me the reason
Why I should change, into a softie
.. after living so loftily
It cost me my soul out of control in a devil's world
Me, my niggas, and my girl - livin the good life!

[Hook]

[E.D.I.]
I spend my days and nights not knowin if, strays in flight
Gon' finally catch me, it's the good life, can you hear me?
Clearly over the edge, soon as I wake up
Last night we off the hook, doin way too much
But it's the fast lane only, big dealin big ceiling
All for the money, some kill some squeal
All for the money, most ain't even real
But we still call 'em homies, now what the fuck is that?
Fake love, fake thugs are, all in the game
I watch 'em all plot and fall while we come up and gain
Outlaw never surrender is the call when you hear us comin
Better start to get to runnin 'fore my click get to gunnin
Still in the midst of all the stress and pain
I'm still tryin to get a hold of the game, livin that good life

Selv efter så lang tid' har jeg taget fremskridt'
Du ser mig, men vælger at kig langt væk
Ingen grund til at sig jeg ik' får respekt'
Når jeg forventer, at problemerne går væk'

Min bror valgte ikke at snakke med mig'
Men han kender, en af mine gode venner'
Så han ser mig tit, og hans hovede vender'
Selvom det gør, vil jeg gi' ham mine modig' hænder'

Jeg vil sig' jeg ved det hele er blevet fucked up'
Og selvom du føler din familie, ikke er god nok'
Vil du så efterlade mig, hvor jeg stod stolt'
Ka' du huske, hvor jeg stolt scorede i fodbold'

Du kamoflere dine følelser over for alle sammen'
Og nu er din lille bror, ved at falde sammen'

Mor hun savner dig mere end noget andet'
Hun snakker om tiderne, hvor vi passede på hinanden

Omkvæd:
Jeg tænker på de problemer' og hvornår de ender'
Hver dato, var fri i din kalender'
Så jeg tænker' hvornår du vælger, at sætte fri hænder'
For hvad verden bringer'
X2

[VERS 2]

Mor hun græder tit, når jeg snakker med hend'
Familien er splittet, og du valgte din egen sti'
Så hvad fuck skal jeg sig' når hun vil se' dig engang til'
Så hvad fuck skal jeg gøre' når det er det eneste hun vil'

Du ved hvordan far han knuste mig'
Du gør det sam' når du ik' vil huske mig'
Kan være jeg går, og tænker tusind tak'
Men når jeg kommer hjem, er jeg bar' et knust barn

Et knustbarn, og du ved det når du ser mig'
Jeg viste kun kærlighed, men nu du blevet min feber
& Folk?
De spørg indtil, hvordan du har det
Men du som død for mig, så ka' ik rigtig svar dem

Og fuck hvad du siger, når jeg laver en sang'
For det bliver første og aller sidste gang'
Du ka' føle dig pinlig, eller føle dig ramt'
Jeg føler det rimeligt, at billederene er blevet brændt'

Omkvæd:
Jeg tænker på de problemer' og hvornår de ender'
Hver dato, var fri i din kalender'
Så jeg tænker' hvornår du vælger, at sætte fri hænder'
For hvad verden bringer'
X2

[VERS 3]

Så nu vi endelig splittet, hvordan føltes det?
Skal man vende hovedet, eller forfølg det
Ka' ikke rigtig se, men et forsøg til'
Gud skifter din familie, men der skal død til

Så bror, lad være ignorer dit savn for mig'
For alle sammen snakker, og snakken den havner fra mig'
Når jeg ikke ka' forsvar mig, og da jeg ik' ku klar mig'
Brugte jeg dig, men nåede aldrig at tak dig'

Men din lillebror, er blevet stor nu'
Han har vreden i sig, og er stadig sur nu'
Så hvad ka du gør' for at ændre den temperatur'
Vil du efterlade ham, eller sluk for komfuret'

Tag dig sammen, hils på din mindre bror'
Minder vil brænde men de sidder fast hvor jeg bor
Tror du gud han gav os kampen for sjov'
Spørg ham, den dag vi ender for oven'

Omkvæd:
Tænker på de problemer, og hvornår de ender'
Hver dato var fri din kalender, så jeg tænker'
Hvornår du vælger, at sætte fri hænder, for hvad verden bringer
X2

[Outro]

1 gang, 2 gang svigt på svigt'
1 ramt, 2 ramt trist eller mist'
Tag dig sammen, for jeg er træt af dit pis'
Sidste chance, hils' eller mist'

"TALE TIL SIDST"***

Ingen vejleder, eller Kommunal dame
Ingen i systemet, træffer dit valg for dig
Det bliver det afgørende, snak, eller pak'
Vi ses nok en til dag, når alt er sagt[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Thinking back, reminiscing on my teens
A young G getting paid over dope fiends
Fucking off cash that I made
Nigga, what's the sense of working hard if you never get to play
I'm hustling, staying out till it's dawn
And coming home at 6 o'Clock in the morning
Hand's on my Glock, eyes on the prize
Finger on the trigger when a nigga ride
Shooting craps, busting niggas out the door
Pick my money off the floor, God bless the tre-four
Stuck on full, drunk again
Sipping on gin with a couple of friends
Say them Thug Life niggas be like major pimps
Sticking to the rules was a major sin
And if I die, let it be
But when it come for me, bury me a G

[Chorus x2: 2Pac]
I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my motherfucking riches
Even when I die, they won't worry me
Mama don't cry, bury me a G

Verse 2: [Mopreme]
More trouble than the average
Just made 25 and I'm living like a savage
Being a G, it ain't no easy thing
Cause you could fuck around, get crossed and get stuck in the game
And for the rest of your life you will sit and reminisce
Wonder why it had to end like this
And to the G's you can feel my pain
Until the motherfucker gets born again

[Verse 3: Rated R]
You thought it was a game kid, I'm not the nigga for playing game
I let my buckshots ring when I pull the trigger on my gauge
I'm on the rampage making runs for the Devil
Ain't nothing on my mind will get me into trouble
I'm tryna ride no more loves for me hard to figure
Get a nigga, smoke a blunt or it's a jury starts (Break yo self)
I gives a fuck nigga stuck outta luck when I bust
Pull me to my death but I'm a G to the enemy

[Hook x2]

[Verse 4: Big Syke]
I got nothing to lose so I choose to be a killer
Went from banging to slanging, now I'm a dope dealer
All my life paid the price to be the boss
Back to school, broke the rules on getting tossed
Popping rocks on the block was a past time
Pack a .9 all the time, you wanna test mine?
Don't cry, I die before they play me
From the cradle to the grave, bury me G

[Verse 5: Macadoshis]
Straight thug kicking it with the homies in the hood
Getting drunk, smoking blunts, my bitch said I'm no good
I gives a fuck I spend my time in the dope spot
Never had no time for no bitch instead slanging rocks
And busting caps on you punk ass marks
Fake ass G's, bitch niggas with no heart
I'm staying real till I'm 6 feet deep
So when a nigga gone, just bury me a G

[Hook x2]

[2Pac]
Stuck on full, Tanqueray got a nigga high
Lord knows I don't need another DUI
I led a Thug Life, heartless hustler
Just cause I fuck don't mean I trust her
Now my pagers vibrating, can't sleep
So I'm mobbing to the ho's house, bumping Isley
"Is it cool to fuck?" Is what I'm asking
Bitch recognize game and started laughing
Now I'm all in those guts and shit
Praying that a nigga don't nut too quick
Cause I'll fuck and get up, I'll let you know
I'll be a 10 minute brother for a $2 ho
Lots of ho's get mad and shit
I let a trick be a trick, you can have that bitch
Cause I doubt if I change, the game's a motherfucker
Real niggas turn to busters, Bury Me a G

[Hook x6][Intro]
Damn. True G. Don't fall asleep nigga, Everybody dies Nigga everybody dies, We all gotta go nigga we all gotta go, Go to sleep nigga, Go to sleep, Close your motherfucking eyes, We all gotta die, Fuck Em All X2, Westside M.O.B

[Verse 1 : 2Pac]
First to bomb, Quick to unload
Expose my foes for being bitches
Keeping niggas suspicious
2 Glocks is filled with ammo
My army fatigues is ready for battle
Lyrical commando, (Let get it on)
Tell me nigga how much can you handle?
Banging on wax
I turn the track into a roman candle
Booom!
My intention specifically
Thugged out no sympathy
Pictures of closed caskets
Soon as Daz get with me (I am first to bomb)
First is the calm then the panic
Soon as my niggas break
We earthquake the whole planet
Adversaries can't understand it
The way my niggas strategize
Don't anybody die unless we planted it
Live long committed, I write songs and then spit it
No matter how hard motherfuckers try
They can't get it
It's west coast
Westide, Outlawz till we die, Thug life motherfuckers on the first ride and we are the first to bomb

[Hook: Big Syke]
I got nothing to lose, paying dues
Nigga you wanna die?
I get high, Then my mission is a walk-by
You'd better jet when i hit your set
Cause i am coming, Start running
Yelling Evil-Mind as i am gunning
One in the chamber
For the anger that i build inside
For the mothers that cried
The beginning is an ending
Am i just a slave
So i got be brave
From the cradle to the grave

[Verse 3 : Eminem]
I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see
So many mothafuckin' people, who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
It's like a fucking army marching in back of me
So many lives I touched, so much anger aimed
In no particular direction, just sprays and sprays
And straight through your radio waves, it plays and plays
'til it stays stuck in your head, for days and days
Who would've thought, standing in this mirror bleaching my hair
With some peroxide, reaching for a t-shirt to wear
That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this
I must've struck a chord with somebody up in the office
Cause Congress keep telling me, I ain't causing nothing but problems
And now they're saying I'm in trouble with the government, I'm loving it
I shoveled shit all my life, and now I'm dumping it

[Hook]

[Verse 3 : 2Pac]
Tell me baby what's your frequency
You see I'm making proposals
Full of verbal indecency when ya meeting me
Flash light i am buzzed
What's right like drugs, got 3 strikes
You got cause last night for thugs
Holding my position
My competition is never ready
Ripped by a machete
My alias is Makaveli
So what they tell me through the grapevine
Niggas ain't ready to see me paid
They rather take mine
Retaliation takes time
Creating rhymes that so ferocious that the bass line
Went for my vocals
Every time a nigga says it rhyme
Spending and busting you thought it up
But you wasn't prepared
Niggas is scared, I am eternally thugging
Like Kamikazes on a suicide mission
I am spitting multiple gunshots
Burning turning rappers to victims
I kick em all day

[Hook : Big Syke]

(Gunshot sound)[Intro]
From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto
From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
June 16th, 1971
Mama gave birth to a Hell-raising heavenly son
See the doctor tried to smack me but I smacked him back
My first words was, "Thug for life" and "Papa, pass the MAC"
I'm busting on these motherfuckers balling
Listen you can hear my mini fourteen calling
From out the window of my drop top, I got my Glock cocked
Busting at niggas, when will it stop?
Now tell me are you scared of the dark? Can't close my eyes I see visions
And even with this thug living will I escape prison?
Penitentiary chances was an all day thang
The only way to advance; and if you slang
Then you'd better have yo' Nikes on
Cause when we fight it's in the middle of the night with no lights on, hey!!
There must be a God cause I feel lucky
Paranoid out my mind cause motherfuckers tryna rush me
Am I going to jail? Look at me bailing
Coming out the court house, all about my mail and bank
Never, never die I'll be a hustler, motherfuckers
And making thugs out you suckers from the cradle to the grave

[Hook]
From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto

[Verse 2: Mopreme]
From the cradle to the grave since a little bitty child
I've been known to get ill and kinda buck wild
Pop pop! Just like the part that's in my walk with street talk
I'm running up the block in the dark where lead spark
Surveillance on a nigga every day
Waiting on my daddy just to take his ass away
Now Mama always working tryna make ends meet
So now a young nigga's being raised by the streets
And then the only other one that ever showed me love
Was my dope fiend uncle strung out on drugs
A straight thug, just me, my mama out here on our own
So I got two gats,one black and one of chrome
Now I don't wanna hurt nobody but I must defend mine!
It's all the fuck I got, so stop and walk a thin line
Young niggas be brave
And keep on thugging from the cradle to the grave
From the cradle to the grave

[Hook]
From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto

[Verse 3: The Rated R]
From the cradle to the grave, I'm glad to say, I made it this far
Many G's died hogs and all they got was they name hit up on a wall
It's sad thinking about the times
Life goes on, I'm steady lost in this land
That's the war zone, I gots no home, don't have no friends neither
It's just me by my lonely so I married my Nina
I keeps her wherever I go, I love my ho
Never leave home with out my sugar, I'm have to plug a nigga
Mama told me not to trust no punks
And kick his ass if he lay a hand on me since then I been knowing
Sometimes I think my own self stupid
Cause I stay shooting at marks, get twisted up in police reports
Since the cradle, I've been ungrateful
My first toy was a gun I got sprung and learned to love weapons
But now I'm through with money, and through with street fame
Somebody peeled my cap, and put me in my grave

[Hook] (x2)
From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy
Livin in the ghetto

[Verse 4: Macadoshis]
March 18th, a rainy day my mama gave birth
To a baby boy trapped in hell on Earth
From day one it wasn't fun I never had a crumb
Daddy worked two jobs and Mama won't stop drinkin rum
I tried to cope loc, but my family's broke
And my pocket's short so now I got ta slang dope
In the game filled with pain it's a fuckin shame
The white man got a motherfucker slangin 'caine
So now it's on from dusk to dawn I'm gettin my serve on
Always in the spot with my Glock slingin rocks at the Rox
The shit don't stop, I'm steady dodgin cops
I never flip-flop, hear my Glock cock, thug 'til I drop
And if I hit the pen I gotta do my time
Sittin on my bunk reminiscin bout the good times
It's fucked up a nigga gotta grow up doin dirt
But from the cradle to the grave I'mma put in work

[Hook] (x2)
From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy
Livin in the ghetto

[Verse 5: Big Syke]
Time's movin fast, will I last another day?
So I pray and I lay with my A-K
Did I sell my soul as a young kid?
All the things I did wishin someone held me but they never did
I can't take it, will I make it to my older age?
Before I'm shot up or locked up in a fuckin cage
Lord help me, guide me, save me!
Cause that's the way that Daddy raised me, crazy
Do or die, nigga pull the trigger don't give a fuck
You'd rather be in jail than get yo' ass bucked
Nobody cares, it's me against the world
Keepin murder on my mind and my tec-9
I got nothin to lose, payin dues, nigga you wanna die?
I get high and then my mission is a walk-by
You'd better jet when I hit your set cause I'm comin
Start runnin yellin "evil mind" as I'm gunnin
One in the chamber for the anger that I build inside
For the mothers that cried, for my homies that died
The beginning is an ending, am I just a slave?
So I got to be brave from the cradle to the grave

[Hook] (x2)
From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy
Livin in the ghetto

Be monkeys up, so call me gettin' toned
Get gone thong, crew comin' through
Big Syke daddy wid the Brooklyn Zu
You know what to do, freaky sucky sucky
Won't you show the crew how you play wit' the monkey
Let him see you don't fake it, and you can take it
It's only the bigger bone, gotta make it
Baby shake it in the worst way, OK
Up in you in the parle
My forte is a freakyness, look at this
I don't kiss anythin' that I don't miss, runnin' sense
To get licked from the nuts to the crack of my butt
I'm a dog, so what, but you still give it up, Wu/woof

Chorus x2

[Too $hort]
Beitch, this is what I tell these hoes
Don't sweat it baby, you'll never be my lady
Take this bone, straight to the dome

You know them +Big Dogs+ hit you wit' their paw ho
Big pimp (pimpin') jump the fence
Hoppin' all night it don't make no sense (na na)
From New York to Cali', whylin' (wild)

And she don't wanna go nowhere

That's why I tell her (tell her)
I'd be wid you forever if I could find time to put you
In my schedule (beitch)
Beitch, $hort Dog in the house

Chorus x2

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
She flew in like calm breeze
Tall brown skin, her weave like palm trees
I went coconuts
Dipped my Dunkin' between your Donut
Don't want it if it ain't no slut, bitch!
Fathership touch ground, like fly on soup
Don't invite me I tear the fuck down
White boys cut my toupee!
Seventh day rester, or scream play
I slump MC slay, it ain't nuttin to bust ass
Bullet him, get him fast
Bitch I don't break out, blast to the next rash
The dog piss on MC's like trees
Got meals but still grill that old good welfare cheese

Chorus x2[Intro: 2Pac talking]
This go out to C. Delores Tucker, Bob Dole
And everybody else who feels like uh
They stronger than the constitution
Freedom of speech big baby
Freedom of speech
Ha ha ha
Outlawz
Goddamn! Rap music I hate that
It's just so violent and it destroys everyone, it makes the kids crazy
The kids kill people
There cop hater
Here going against society, I don't understand the music
It's too loud, it's too rowdy, it's too violent
Let's ban all rap music
(Outlawz)
Ban 2Pac, ban the Outlaw Immortalz ban 'em
[Verse One: Young Noble]
Listen it ain't no stopping
I gotta hustle
Cop it make it double, try to
Stop it and touch it, I'mma cock it and bust it
Niggas tryna get it addicted to fast living
Get rich or die trying nigga as 50
I've been Operating Under Thug Laws As A Warrior
Oppressed by the industry the Hip-Hop government ?? by the Hip-Hop Police
Why you think Nas screaming Hip-Hop deceased?
No justice (No justice)
All the judges got grudges
Giving my niggas life for a little next to nothing
So wherever you are, just a little extra something
You ain't the only one, we all going through the struggle
Penny pinching
It's like you really ain't living
? until eleven's, I'm cooking in the kitchen
Like we looking and we wishing
Praying will he hear it?
It's eating at my spirit
Speaking for the spirits

[Verse Two: 2Pac]
You can't break me
Never make me
Busta soft the beats
This Outlaw style got a brother off the streets
Miss Deloris Tucker sue me I won't stop
Till we get justice for these crooked cops on my block
Time Warner full of sissies
Tell 'em all to miss me
A bunch of hypocrites
Whistling Dixie
Good riddance cause you never should of touched me
You cowards knew you couldn't take the pressure I'mma make you sorry
Trust me
Didn't cry when they dropped me
(Nah)
Can they stop me?
Tryna sell 4 million copies
If I wasn't spitting it'd be prison or death
This rap game all we got left
So try to comprehend where we coming from
Life as an Outlaw
Ain't meant for everyone
So here we come
Recognize how we organize
Strategize now we unified brothers on the rise
And we can't stop

[Hook: Young Noble & Stormy]
No way no how we got to keep moving
And putting it down
We can't stop
(Outlawz)
Until we reach the top
Through the music we speak to the blocks
Believe it or not
I don't know what you've been, told
Real niggas don't stay on they go
Can't stop until I get that you know
Won't stop until I get that keep going

[Verse Three: Hussein Fatal]
Bury me with a Makaveli suit and a Mac
I've God strike me with lightning, I'm shooting him back
Skinny cause I don't work out, my man is in the gym
Long as I'm strong enough to put a hammer on your chin
Trapped in the storm
Fuck the world till I'm gone
I'm bucking at Corey Brooke he treating my niggas wrong
Until I'm gone
They gon' see who I be
I picture this bricks ducking from the penitentiary

[Verse Four: Kadafi]
See
Mysteriously it seems
Through my deepest thoughts and dreams its all wrong
Pop too long gone, and now 18 I'm stranded on my own
Abandoned here in the zone
Protect my thrown pal like a king, Al Capone style
Fake no jacks on this grind
Coked up with crack I get mine
Living life as a Don, Guess Gortex, Louis Vuitton

[Verse Five: Hussein Fatal]
Yeah your boys back with the proper team
When they think I'm wearing Red I'mma rock the Green
On a whole 'nother episode
Cops never heard of ya
The otherside'll hide down the block from the murder scene
Catch ya man he dead with the Fifth
When it's hot on Nu he G-Ride from the clear to the bricks
So gangster how he switched from the clear to the bricks
Niggas hate it but they scared of the Fifth

(And we won't stop)
Outlawz!

[Hook]

[Verse Six: Big Syke]
This rap game like a robbery
Cause it seem somebody hiding me
My nigga, made a motherfucker cop a Ki'
Motherfucker ain't no stopping me
My nigga, It's Mussolini see me all in the midst
I'm still chilling like I'm bottle of Crys'
Enemies sharpen they ?
And when they see me they can give me a kiss
So I'm posing with the frozen wrists
Outlaw immortalized we survived and curst
So I claim it like I'm bangin a turf
Yeah it's easy like I'm putting in work
Not been easy you wanna jerk
Come the squeezey I'm ready to murk
Outlawz, Makaveli niggas ready to flow
So baby are you ready to go?
Outlaw my niggas be screaming at night
A Big Syko with the thug in your life

[Verse Seven: EDI Amin]
Don't stop (Don't stop)
Keep going (Keep going)
Even when the wheels fall off we keep rolling (Keep rolling)
This Hip-Hop thing just won't stop
It's number one at the top of the charts
Here to stay like 'Pac
Man I just can't let it go
It's in my blood stream (Yeah)
So when I flow, I gotta do my thug thing
For the hood the under privileged and oppressed
Young nigga get rich, cash more cheques
Take the hood life
Put it on on wax
Get stakes now we living the good life
Car brand new and it shine so clean
Bought momma a house, on sweet sixteen's
And we, sitting clean in the latest edition
From the block to the movie screen deep in and pimpin'
Recognize how we organize
Strategize now we unified brothers on the rise
And we won't stop

[Hook][2Pac]
I was so money orientated, initiated as a thug
Fiendin' for wicked adventures, ambitious as I was
Picture a nigga on the verge of livin' insane
I sold my soul for a chance to kick it and bang
Now tell if I'm wrong
But sayin' "Fuck the world" got you deeper in my songs
Drinkin' 'til I earl, spendin' money 'til it's gone
It's the good life - maybe niggas got it goin' on
Now maybe if I died, and came back, wouldn't have to slang crack
Addicted to the game, so obviously we came strapped
Please forgive me for my wicked ways, fuck a bitch
Bad Boy niggas eat a dick a day, bumpin' this
Lord have mercy it's a slaughter
So wicked that my tracks is wettin' niggas like it's water
I learned my lessons as a thug in these wicked ass hood fights
But I'm a baller now, nigga, I live the good life

[Hook]
This is the good life, fuck my foes
God bless the dumb niggas that, trust them hoes
Found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
And live the good life, cause thug niggas don't die
We live the good life, fuck my foes
God bless the dumb niggas that, trust these hoes
Found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
And live the good life, cause thug niggas don't die

[Big Syke]
No one knows what the, future holds, but you
Haha.. listen close
They say reach in yo' heart and you'll find your mind
Every day in the streets, got my foresight blind
My after time is narrow, peepin down the barrel of a foe
Just a nigga or a killer I don't know so
Who makes the call will I fall a victim like the rest?
Slug in the chest, one in the dome and make sure I'm gone
Send me home all alone in these cold streets
In desperation constantly drinkin and I can't sleep
Neck deep strugglin tryin to survive
Some wanna die I wanna stay alive, eyes on the prize
Let me modify this whole region
I declare this sucker duckin' season, give me the reason
Why I should change, into a softie
.. after living so loftily
It cost me my soul out of control in a devil's world
Me, my niggas, and my girl - livin the good life!

[Hook]

[E.D.I.]
I spend my days and nights not knowin if, strays in flight
Gon' finally catch me, it's the good life, can you hear me?
Clearly over the edge, soon as I wake up
Last night we off the hook, doin way too much
But it's the fast lane only, big dealin big ceiling
All for the money, some kill some squeal
All for the money, most ain't even real
But we still call 'em homies, now what the fuck is that?
Fake love, fake thugs are, all in the game
I watch 'em all plot and fall while we come up and gain
Outlaw never surrender is the call when you hear us comin
Better start to get to runnin 'fore my click get to gunnin
Still in the midst of all the stress and pain
I'm still tryin to get a hold of the game, livin that good life

[Hook] - 2X (w/ minor variations)[Syke talkin']
Yeah...... yeah
The good times
When you was a little kid
Playing in the yard, you know

Verse 1:

It seems like yesterday I used to play around the way
Those were the good timez
Growing up as a child, carefree
Momma said I was wild by three
Even pops showed me love he was there
I remember hanging out playing truth or dare
Cowboys and indians, ring your bell and run
When the only thing we sprayed was water guns
We didn't have much so we made the best of
What we could afford but we had love
Tryna be grown might snick and curse
One tv set gotta cut it on first
Back in the good timez and the Jeffersons
When ya next door neighbour was ya best friend
Those are the days I miss and reminisce...
So I steady wish, for the good timez

Chorus:

Nothing but the good timez on my mind, can I rewind
The time back to my early days, as children play
On the road to tomorrow, some passed away
So my future feels hollow

Verse 2:

I'm thinking back on my history, in my elementary
I wonder do they still remember me?
That little bad ass kid
The boy that wanted someone to help him, but they never did
So off to the office I go, you know
A problem case from the get go
Will I ever change before it's too late?
I need to study harder and get my life straight
Moms and pops praying for the best for me
I was blind and I couldn't see
But they told me friends come and go as you grow
Focus in, play to win, or you will live low
So I tried to do my best, failed every test
My life was becoming a mess
Even though the past years are far behind
They in my mind... considered as a good time

Chorus


Verse 3:

I remember playing in the street wid my lil bro
Kickin' it wid Mental and Big K-Dog where you go?
Dizzy D, Big Chip, rest in peace
Nissy T and all my other people de-ceased
Can't let my memories slip away
No I ain't okay, cause I haven't seen you today
Nothing but good timez, on my mind, can I rewind?
The time back when I used to have a seventy-nine 'Lac
Wid a black phantom and I bought 'em selling crack
I want 'em back, my teachers Miss Satedon, Miss Nor-ville
Encouraged me, and wished me well
To excell in life, it's a high price
Good advice, summer nights fist fights
Saying, things wouldn't be so bad
If we got the things we never had

[Syke talks]
I ain't mad, huh-ha-ha
I'm thinking 'bout the good timez
I'm thinking 'bout the good timez

Chorus ('til fade)[2Pac]
How long will they mourn me?
Yeah! This for my nigga Kato, it's still on nigga - believe that
We live a Thug Life, Thugs for Life, ha ha
(How long will they mourn me?) We handle this shit for you bwoy
Yeah nigga.. 2Pac in this motherfucker

All my homies drinkin' liquor, tears in everybody's eyes
Niggas cried, to mourn a homie's homicide
But I can't cry, instead I'm just a shoulder
Damn, why they take another soldier?
I load my clip before my eyes blurry, don't worry
I'll get them suckers back before you're buried (shit)
Retaliate and pull a one-eight-seven
Do real niggas get to go to heaven?
How long will they mourn me? Bury me a motherfuckin' G
Bitch don't wanna die; then, don't fuck with me
It's kinda hard to be optimistic
When your homie's lyin' dead on the pavement twisted
Y'all don't hear me doe, I'm tryin hard to make amends
But I'm losin' all my motherfuckin' friends.. damn!
They should've shot me when I was born
Now I'm trapped in the motherfuckin' storm
How long will they mourn me?

[Hook: Nate Dogg + 2Pac]
[Nate] I wish it would have been another
[2Pac] How long will they mourn me?
[Nate] How long.. will they mourn.. my brother
(Half them niggas all dead and shit)
[2Pac] How long will they mourn me?
[Nate] I wish it would have been another
(Dedicated this to Kato nigga, and e'ry thug)
[2Pac] How long will they mourn me?
[Nate] How long.. will they mourn.. my brother
(Yo nigga, we gotta keep this shit goin' on, yo Syke)

[Big Syke]
How long will they mourn me? Every motherfuckin' day homie
You stayed down when the other niggas didn't know me
From my heart to the trigger you my fuckin' nigga
And things won't be the same without ya nigga
I remember kickin' back, you wanted a 'llac
And goin' half on a motherfuckin' hundred sack
Smokin' blunt after blunt, and steady drinkin'
Hung around so much, you knew what I was thinkin'
Tell me Lord, why you take big Kato?
So confused not knowing which way to go
I'm goin' crazy and runnin' out of fuckin' time
I can't take it, I'm losin' my fuckin' mind
So day after day, ride after ride
We'll hook up on the other side
Watch over your family and your newborn
Till we meet again homie - how long will they mourn me?

[Hook: Nate Dogg + Big Syke]
[Nate] I wish it would have been another (Big Kato)
[Syke] How long will they mourn me? (It's still on nigga)
[Nate] How long.. will they mourn.. my brother
[Syke] How long will they mourn me?
[Nate] I wish it would have been another (Yeah)
[Syke] How long will they mourn me?
[Nate] How long.. will they mourn.. my brother
[Syke] Rated R (Double Jeapordy) Mac 10

[The Rated R]
Damn, a nigga tired of feelin' sad, I'm tired of puttin' in work
I'm tired of cryin' watchin' my homies leave the - earth
I know soon one day I'll be in the dirt
And my peoples'll be mournin', when they get a call from the coroner
All niggas can say is that's fucked up
And get tossed up, reminiscin' how we grew up (my nigga)
Rest and love to my nigga Kato, see you in the crossroads real soon
For now let me pour out some brew
I'll be always thinkin' of ya homie
Rest in peace.. how long will they mourn me?

[Macadoshis/"Mac 10"]
We know life's a fuckin' trip, and everybody gotta go
But why the fuck it have to be my nigga Kato?
Another nigga fell victim to the chrome
It's enough to make you crazy, it's fuckin with my dome
Ya only live once on this earth
A nigga had it bad, since the day, of my motherfuckin' birth (uh)
But niggas say they down and they always be my homie
But when a nigga gone, how long will ya mourn me? (YEAH!)

[Hook: Nate Dogg + 2Pac]
[Nate] I wish it would have been another
(Mac 10 in this motherfucker, yeah!)
[2Pac] How long will you mourn me?!
[Nate] How long.. will they mourn.. my brother
(Thug Life boy, Nate, blowin that shit)
[Nate] I wish it would have been another
(Nate Dogg do that shit nigga, yeah)
[2Pac] How long will you mourn me?!
[Nate] How long.. will they mourn.. my brother
(This for my nigga Kato, and all his kids)
[2Pac] How long will you mourn me?!
[Nate] I wish it would have been another
[Nate] How long.. will they mourn.. my brother

{*fades out*}Straight out the motherfucking bay
Here we go

[2Pac]
Lord help me, save me, Mama keep praying
For a young motherfucker trying to duck an early grave
In the city where ya can't tell the snakes from the fakes
Fakes from the phonies, enemies of homies
Around the corner there's another nigga waiting to jack
He don't know I got a Glock 'til his ass get shot
Like a motherfucking thug disease
Craving beats like they motherfucking drugs to me, hey
What's up with bitches trying to screw me? Do me cause I did a movie
Throw the pussy to me but before they never knew me
Rather die then let ya play me for a, buster
And with my Glock I'm a plotting ass rotten motherfucker, huh
Don't let the movie fool ya, let me school ya
Screaming Thug Life nigga when I do ya
I'm going crazy, getting dizzy
And then I suffacate a motherfucking breather bring me back
I'm telling ya I'm losing it

[Hook]
Said I'm losing my mind
Losing my mind
[ X4 ]

[Big Syke]
I'm going crazy, niggas can't fade me
On the real I kill when I step to ya fucking grill
So let me kick it let me flip it let me get wicked
I'm not a buster from the hood selling wolf tickets
I hang with G's flipping keys and smoking weed
I get the cash and dash and never learn to read
So fuck a bitch fuck a ho and I let ya know
Because they come and go like the wind blows
What am I giving how I'm living what I'm giving up
You can take my life and I don't give a fuck
Cause I'm the trouble most coming from the west coast
Where the niggas is banging 'til the overdose
Killers and murderers, psychos and lunatics
Nobody knows what makes my mind click
Is it the demons, screaming inside of me?
Hell no it's just the Thug Life mentallity
I'm going crazy shit don't phase me
I'm living like a thug 'til six niggas carry me
Death is on the trigga so pull it
I can't take it no more, nigga, I'm losing it

[Hook]

[Spice 1]
Shit was talking to me, my gat screamed fire
The bullet told me shoot that motherfucker he's a liar
I talked to me 3-80 like a bitch on a stroll
When my niggas try to ????
Nigga, I can't get fucked in this game I'm a psychopath
My AK told me to shove him up some niggas ass
I'm having long conversations with Mr. Millimeter
He's one of my best friends bitch ass nigga eater
And Miss Mossburg love it in the back trunk
You know that old school bitch she like to get it funked
And spitting motherfuckers by the seems
My grand daddy Mr. AR-15
By the evil motherfucker
Talked me into taking over a dope turf and shooting cluckers
Said he was my only family
Shoot straight, and please don't jam me
Got in a fight at the club my gat started talking
Told me to shut the fuck up and let him do the talking
I woke up and it was sick to see the guts hang
I'm going nuts man
Shit was talking to me

[Hook] to fade(2Pac talking)

Well, I just heard some shit on this record
(Fuckin' in the midst of my comrades)
I send this out to that biatch
You too nigga
(Standin' in the midst of my comrades)
You fuckin' with some thug niggas
(That's right)
Believe that like you believe crack kills you stupid muthafucka
(Fuck you)
(Standin' in the midst of my comrades)

(Chorus: 2Pac)

You must be
So so crazy
Bitch I'll beat yo' boy band
Standin' in the midst of my comrades (comrades)
Bitches can't fade me
Plottin' but they ploy's crashed
Fuckin' with the midst of my comrades (comrades)

(Verse One: 2Pac)

Have you really thought about your part in this participation
My prediction bloody murder similar to ministration
Now in fairness to conversation
Cause it's your fate so take the time to contemplate what you'll be facin'
Talkin' that
Hip-hop shit, don't get shot bitch
Cause you can tell
All in your clique to eat 'Pac's dick
The clip's in, prepare for the muthafuckin' death blow
Cause every rapper in the industry is history it's Death Row
Not Bad Boy or So So Def
I make you bow before Tha Row
Just like them other hoes
The intricate design of my lethal lines criminal rhymes
From the mind of a thug shakin' state time
Take it to the next phase
You had your time to talk shit
Now bitchless busters gettin' checkmated
These days muthafuckas talk shit and turn snitch when you see 'em they ain't talkin' about shit
Westside

(Chorus: 2Pac)

(Verse Two: EDI)

See by now the way this shit is situated
Niggas is gettin' eliminated
Simply for being affiliated
Clearly stated and man I know you hate it
We got a whole list to play with
And y'all niggas is at the top
Now let's make this
Happen
Fuck the rappin'
Let's get to scrappin'
So niggas can see what happens when you get caught up in dirty mackin'
EDI'll send you packin'
You know what we love action
Sneak up on attack
Pull back
Let's the slug's snappin'
Yo' chest section
Death has now stepped in
Bitch should have learnt your lesson
While your chance was still present
But now it's past tense
No question askin'
Out West it's called mashin'
Bailin' the corner blastin'

(Chorus: 2Pac)

(Verse Three: Napoleon)

You must be
So so crazy
Bitch I'll beat yo' boy bad
Drivin' in the truck with my black mac
Thinkin' about the shit I never had
So I'm loadin' up one
And the two thing's that I cherish
Is money and gun's
I love my ones
And now I put blood on you
Snatch money from you
Leave slug's in you
Ain't no nigga breathin' fuckin' with 'Pac
Every album that he drop nigga
Number one spot nigga, locked nigga
Let me represent for my dead ones
Eat with my loved ones
Squeeze when the beef come
Chill when the freeze comes
I do that shit
You think you heavy in the game watch me move you bitch
This Napoleon, why did I say I again?
You punk niggas already know I ain't for show
And I'll die for the dough nigga that's fo' sho'
Never die for a ho nigga that's a no no

(Chorus: 2Pac)

(Verse Four: Big Syke)

Who I'm gonna call when a muthafucka feelin' sad?
My muthafuckin' comrades
Who I'm gonna call when a muthafucka doin' bad?
My muthafuckin' comrades
And fuck yo' bitch
Cause you a trick anyway
Cause my comrades was raised on pistol play
And boss playerism mixed with this thugism
So ain't no love in 'em nothin' but the fuckism

(Verse Five: 2Pac)

Last verse is for them trick people
This is the sequel
I'mma treat you with evil
Livin' forever illegal
Now homicide got me preoccupied
Be a lie if I told you that I never wonder
When will I die
Be assured nigga word born
Cause now it's on you can only survive if you be strong
Until I'm gone
I bust on Bad Boy middle finger to Da Brat
Don't get your young ass smacked

(Chorus x3)

(2Pac talking)

Look here
(What)
You muthafuckas knew when you wrote this shit
(Outlaw Immortalz)
When you spoke this shit
(Thug Life)
When you smoked thsi shit
(Outlaw Immortalz)
Uh, that you couldn't fuck around with us
(Thug Life)
Now what the hell possessed you to get on record and play yo' self like that?

(Outlaw Immortalz)[Intro]
Uhh.. dear Mr. President
What's happening?
I'm writin' you because, shit is still real fucked up in my neighborhood
Pretty much the same way, right around the time when you got elected
Ain't nothin' changed
All the promises you made, before you got elected..
.. they ain't came true

[2Pac]
Tell me what to do, these niggas actin up in the hood
Send mo' troops, dear Mr. President
(Me and my homies is wonderin' what's goin' on.. holla!)
Tell me what to do, these niggas actin up in the hood
Send mo' troops..

Why should I lie, when I can dramatize?
Niggas fell victim to my lyrics, now traumatized
Simply by spittin' I've been blessed given riches, enemies suspicious
Cause I'm seldom in the company of bitches
Plus the concepts I depict, so visual, that you can kiss
Each and every trick or bitch, inside the shit I kick
My heaviest words'll move a mountain
Casualties in mass amounts, brothers keep countin'
Fuck the friendships, I ride alone
Destination Death Row, finally found a home
Plus all my homies wanna die, call it euthanasia
Dear Lord, look how sick this ghetto made us, sincerely
Yours I'm a thug, the product of a broken home
Everybody's doped up, nigga what you smokin' on?
Figure if we high they can train us
But then America fucked up and blamed us
I guess it's cause we black that we targets
My only fear is God, I spit that hard shit
In case you don't know, I let my pump go
Get it ride for Mutulu like I ride for Geronimo
Down to die, for everything I represent
Meant every word, in my letter to the President

Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
(What should I do?)
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin up in the hood, send mo' troops

[E.D.I. Amin]
Oh you's a baller in the White House, I hope you comfortable
Cause yo I spend my nights out, with the lights out
Under the safety of darkness, amongst the crazed and the heartless
And young soul bros, ready to rode a starship
Launch it, leave a nigga flat for scratch, the Godless
I gotta get chips, but you can't understand that
Wanna ban rap? Stand back, before you get hurt
It's the only thing makin' pay besides smoke and work
On a mission listen more chips my goal and position
First on my decision I realized the same nigga
Trippin' to drastic measures tryin' to get stacks of cheddar
Muh'fuckers hate cops, wait it ain't gettin' better
But you keep, tellin' us, that it is
While your motherfuckin' troops keep killin' our kids, dig
Don't be surprised if you see us
Dumpin with nuttin but artillery to free us, motherfucker

Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin up in the hood, send mo' troops

[Kastro]
Strapped and angry, with no hope and heartbroke
Fightin' first my trained brain until it's not so
It's hostile, niggas lick shots to watch the Glocks glow
Cadres of coppers patrol us like we some animals
And it ain't no peace, my peace a piece on my streets
To people beefin' and things, squeakin' on they beefs for weeks
Mr. President, it's evident, nobody really care
For a struggler out the gutter, twenty-two with gray hair
I was raised to raise hell, frail and my heart stale
So I'mma bring hell to earth until my heart fail
But y'all play fair, give me and mine, I'll share
Til y'all show us you care, it's gon' be mayhem out here
Me and these 223's will freeze the biggest with ease
I'm still a nigga you fear, bring the beast to his knees
And I've been born to represent, for that I've been heaven sent
And I meant, every word, in my letter, to the President

Shit is still fucked up y'all
And y'all wonder when it's gon' get better
And it ain't gon' get better

[2Pac]
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin up..

Heavenly Father may I holla at you briefly
I wanna meet the President, but will he meet me?
Is he scared to look inside the eyes of a Thug Nigga?
We tired of bein' scapegoats for this capitalistic drug dealin'
How hypocritical is Liberty?
That blind bitch ain't never did shit for me
My history, full of casket and scars
My own black nation at war, whole family behind bars
And they wonder why we scarred, thirteen lookin' hard
Sister had a baby as an adolescent, where was God?
Somewhere in the middle of my mind
Is a nigga on the tightrope, screamin' let him die
Can't lie I'm a thug, drownin' in my own blood
Lookin' for the reason that my momma's strung out on drugs
Down to die, for everything I represent
Meant every word, in my letter to the President

[Big Syke]
Blacks is broke, think it's a joke that we livin' low?
Y'all sniffin' blow and postin' what they hittin' fo'?
Tell the secretary it's necessary we get paid
Look what you made, little kids gettin' sprayed
Day after day, and night after night
Battles and wars to the daylight
We might change and rearrange if you do somethin'
Till then we gonna keep it comin', Mr. President
And I meant every word in my letter to the President

[2Pac]
Word motherfuckin' life
Fuck this nigga think?
Cuttin' taxes, takin' off welfare
We 'sposed to just sit here, go broke and die, starvin'?
Motherfuckers crazy in their motherfuckin’ scalp
Nigga this Thug Life, Westside Outlaw Immortalz nigga
We fin' to hustle till we come up

Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin up in the hood, send mo' troops

Dear Mr. Clinton, shit
It's gettin' harder and harder for a motherfucker
To make a dollar in these here streets
I mean shit, I hear you screamin' peace
But we can't find peace
Til my little niggas on these streets get a piece
I know you feel me cause you too near me not to hear me
So why don't you help a nigga out?
Sayin you cuttin' welfare
That got us niggas on the street, thinkin' who in the hell care?
Shit, y'all want us to put down our Glocks and our rocks
But y'all ain't ready to give us no motherfuckin' dollars
What happened to our 40 acres and a mule fool?
We ain't stupid
Think you got us lookin' to lose
Tryin' to turn all us young niggas into troops
You want us to fight your war
What the fuck I'm fightin for?
Shit, I ain't got no love here
I ain't had a check all year
Taxin, all the blacks and
Police beatin' me in the streets
Fuck peace

These niggas actin up in the hood, send mo' troops[2Pac]
Now I've got to ask, on a nigga's ass, tell me will they blast me?
I think of an alias in case these crooked bitches ask me
Now, it's gettin crazy after dark, these NARC's
Be like tryin to shut me down but I'm too smart
Now picture me scared of the penitentiary
I've been movin these things since the days of elementary
Now tell me what you need when you see me
I'm stackin G's, buyin all the things on TV, believe me
I got some killers on my payroll, and they know
When it's time to handle business, nigga lay low
Although I'm young, I'm still comin up
I'm gettin paid, pullin razors on niggas when they runnin up
The first to pull a strap when there's drama - busta you ain't heard?
I've been slicin motherfuckers since I lost my mama
There ain't a cop that can stop me
My posse is cock D, and they don't quit until they drop me
I'm loyal to the game

[Hook]
{"Prince of peace must hear our plea"}
{"Told life you'd be back"} {"There you were"}
{"Prince of peace must hear our plea"}
{"Everybody look around"} {"There is no hope"}
{"Prince of peace must hear our plea"}
{"Brothers we better get hip"}

[Big Syke]
My mama say I'm crazy cause I'm all about the hood
I can't get my shit together but I'm on leather and wood
And the hood is all I know, patrol and circle the block
Off the curb and niggas swerve, serve a smoker a rock
And I'm hot like fish grease and nigga so is my Caddy
And I'm steady catchin static, move the traffic to the alley
Out in Cali niggas rally others all for the soil
Mix the work with bakin soda and get the water to boil
OH NO can't no busters hang, I hope you feel me mayne
Cause snitches bitches and they ain't been loyal to the game
My niggas feel my pain, when sunshine turn to rain
You know these buster motherfuckers came to fuck the game
And it's a shame I see the mark in they eyes
When they yellin that he tellin get to me, no surprise, nigga

[Hook]

{"And come off this trip"}

[DJ Quik]
Loyalty, undeservedly, never heard of me
I, be the exception, the epitome of adaption
The superficial surroundings, bullets fiends cockhounds and
Enemies in my family extortin schemin and scammin me (pop pop)
I'm like Bruce Nolan, I'm rollin' until the diesel hit me
I'm battered and bruised, and madder havin to choose
'tween happiness and the blues, and who be fillin my shoes
When I done had it with crews, ecstatic to see me lose
But panic when I be smooth, I'm manic but I'm no fool
Y'all rappin I'm talkin cool, and Columbine is not new
In Compton they shoot up schools too, ridin by to see who's who
Cock the shotty they cruise through, rock the body blood ooze through
Tell his family that dude's blue, no comin back
From him scrappin when niggas was packin and he wasn't packin too
So if you feel me you know when they try to kill me they slow
I seen from 'round the corner with mirrors and creeped up on 'em

[Hook] - 5/6ths

{"Thugs throw like wine down a nigga's throat
If this shit don't STOP STOP STOP STOP STOP!"}Intro: Syke

If I die right now there somethings I want to say
Don't plan for the future cause the future is today
Live ya life like ya dying, cause in reality you are
Sometimes sacrificed, but keep praying to the stars

Verse 1:

Stay focused, they say the loc'est will die first
But the calm quiet type seems to be the worst, since birth
Off from the casket to the basket was obituary
To fulfill yo life is necessary, it's scary
That you gotta live to die, why ask why?
I need fortification in this situation passing by
Cryin' inside as I get high, as I ride
Through the Southside wonderin' when I'm gon' die
Fuck a try clock tickin' when ya born
When a baby enter this world we need to mourn
My heart's torn apart from the start
Things are never feelin' right
Runnin' in the night tryna beam up satelite
Shot a kite to that homie feelin' lonely out here
It seems done into things dreams, and nightmares
Trapped in darkness regardless my mind's touched
Ambushed in poverty so life don't matter much
Such envy and misery surroundin' me my destiny
Is to ball outta control
Want a leader follow me on a illest journey searchin' for Yahweh
I'm campaigning for him nigga

[Syke sings along with the Hook]
I wanna lay in a far deep away seclusion
But I can't get away it's an illusion
I'm falling further into darkness
That's why we heartless
(2x)

Chorus:
Nobody knows what the future holds for you
Don't hesitate do all the things you plan to do
Life's to short, time flies as you grow
I know you don't wanna die
But one day you have to go
(1x)

Verse 2:

Once told time prosperity's not clear, no fear
My prospective can't find it but it's so near, reappear
Cause I'm almost dead steady dodgin' lead
Wanted by the feds, take me dead, feel what I said
Step in this world die forever tryna make it
Make a plan get what you can cause niggas fake it
I had to take it cause I see you can't see me wid it
Searching for greater days, are the ways to get it, shit it's
Gettin' crazy in the land where nobody cares
A ?placebo? in the mist of the night air
Prepare to get yours, open doors to a money journey
Niggas is counterfeit so bullshit don't concern me
Follow me and I'll take you where the Gs hang
Where authentic hogs made it off the street fame
Check game I been and evil mind since '79
Now niggas want me to rewind
On my way out nigga!

Chorus (along wid Syke)

Verse 3:

I know thugs that'll bury ya
I live in a drug area
Outta sight some nights'll get scarier
Drivin' on a murder course, no remorse, can't feel
Even through the pain and sufferin' we keep it real
Let's make a deal I get killed, by a black
If I do, gimme my life back
On the attack mode, ice cold as I dip ghetto block
Blunt in my mouth, hand on my Glock
Poppin' rocks is a past time hobby I take serious
Some disappear it's mysteriously funny
It's about money where I live and stay
But still ain't got here to this day
I wanna lay in a far deep away seclusion
But I can't get away it's an illusion
Nigga prostitution are the drug trade in the States
Like devil case, they all perpetrate
I'm on my way out

Chorus (1x) (w/o Syke)

[Syke sings solo]
I wanna lay in a far deep away seclusion
But I can't get away it's an illusion
I'm falling further into darkness
That's why we heartless
(1x)

Chorus ('til fade)[Intro]
Yeah, clear enough for ya?
Why you niggas look mad?
Y'all supposed to be happy I'm free!
Y'all niggas look like y'all wanted me to stay in jail
Ho bustas!

[Verse 1]
Picture me rolling in my 500 Benz
I got no love for these niggas, there's no need to be friends
They got me under surveillance, that's what somebody be telling
Know there's dope being sold, but I ain't the one selling!
Don't want to be another number
I gotta puff a gang of weed to keep from going under
The federales wanna see me dead - niggas put prices on my head
Now I got two Rottweilers by me bed, I feed em lead
Now I'm released, how will I live? Will God forgive me
For all the dirt a nigga did, to feed kids?
One life to live, it's so hard to be positive
When niggas shooting at your crib
Mama, I'm still thugging, the world is a war zone
My homies is inmates, and most of them dead wrong
Full grown, finally a man, just scheming on ways
To put some green inside the palms of my empty hands
Just picture me rollin'
Flossing a Benz on rims that isn't stolen
My dreams is censored, my hopes are gone
I'm like a fiend that finally sees when all the dope is gone
My nerves is wrecked, heart beating and my hands are swollen
Thinking of the G's I'll be holdin', picture me rollin'

[Interlude]
Can you see me now?
Move to the side a little bit so you can get a clear picture
Can you see it?
Pictue me rollin
Yeah nigga!
Ay, but peep how my nigga Syke do it to you
Guess who's back?

[Verse 2: Syke]
I got keys coming from overseas
Cost a nigga 200 G's
I'm a street commando, Nino for example
This lavish lifestyle is hard to handle
So I got to floss cause I'm more like a boss player
Thug, branded to be a women-layer
So many player haters, imitators steady swanging
Make me wanna start back banging
So I'm caught up in the game, dress code changed
Packing 40 Glocks, contain em or rearrange
All that jealousy and envy coming from my enemies
While I'm sipping on Remy
In front of black Lexus, Chevy's on the roam
'96 big body, sitting on chrome
As we head up out the zone, stone-facing is on
You can admire, but don't look too long
I'm living a dream with triple beams and my pockets bulgin
It's hard to imagine -- picture me rollin!

[CPO]
I gots to get the fuck up in it, formulate a caper
Cause a nigga straight suffering from lack of having paper
My bitch fin' to have a bastard, see?
So I needs to hit a lick, drastically
I see some ballin' ass niggas, and they slippin' in my spot
And, uh, diggin the plots (so what?)
Checking in the park, 'Pac

[2Pac]
We caught em sleeping, he didn't peep you niggas creeping?
This how we do it every weekend
I dump for madness, it's time to count the profit
CPO, we got the bomb spot, nigga time to clock it
I get the liquor, and you could get the females
This crooked shit that we inflicting getting street sales!

[CPO]
Move smooth as a motherfucker, me and my 9
I'm as cool as a motherfucker: I'mma get mine
Now we satisfied, got the pockets on swollen
Boss Hog and this 'Pac nigga: picture us rollin

[Outro - 2Pac]
Is y'all ready for me?
Picture me rollin roll call
You know there's some muh'fuckers out there
I just could not forget about
I wanna make sure they can see me
Number one on my list: Clinton Correctional Facilities
All you bitch ass C.O.'s
Can you niggas see me from there?
Ballin on y'all punk ass!
Picture me rollin, baby
Yeah, all them niggas up in them cell blocks
I told y'all niggas when I come home it's on
That's right nigga, picture me rollin
Oh, I forgot! The D.A
Yeah, that bitch had a lot to talk about in court
Can the ho see me from here?
Can you see me, ho?
Picture me rollin
And all you punk police -- can you see me?
Am I clear to you?
Picture me rollin' nigga, legit
Free like O.J. all day
You can't stop me
You know I got my niggas up in this motherfucker
Manute, Pain, Syke, [Bogart?], Mopreme
It's sad dog, can you picture us rolling?
Can you see me ho?
Is y'all ready for me? .. We up out this bitch
Any time y'all wanna see me again
Rewind this track right here, close your eyes
And picture me rollinI hope it can work out tonight
I know we been seein' each other for a long time
And (hahaha) I'm hopin' tonight can be the night...
Yeah, that's right

[2Pac]
Another shady mission
Had enough of shady tricks
You so suspicious like watchin' pictures in hazy' vision
Tonight is love making
Take you any place you wish
Today we satisfy
Cause they were stolen kisses
Blind insanity
Perfect pictures of me and my family
Not understanding the destiny
That they planned for me
If I have kids will I live to see' em grow?
Well I don't know
I live the life of a thug nigga until the day I go
More broken promises
A sacred bond broken
I know I'll die alone
But yet and still I'm hopin'
Visions of prisons
Maybe I'll be forgiven
I know its better in heaven cause bein' here ain't living
Close my eyes and see nothing but pain the world's crazy
Still look for a queen to plant seeds and have babies
Maybe I'll be the one
Or maybe I'm lost
You'll never know being cautious, if you play your cards right

[Hook: Hurt-M-Badd]
If you play your cards right, everything will be alright
If you play your cards right, tonight will be the night
(repeat 2x)

[Big Syke]
I'm always in the mix
Life is full of tricks
I guess, tryin' my best, nothing less
Before I lay to rest
My quest in future I mourn like new born baby
Intense before a world so crazy
My daddy raised me to be a man
To do the best I can
He said you won't succeed in life without a plan
Its hard to take what's in my trait
Within hate
Can't wait, better change before its too late

[Mopreme]
They got me at the bottom of a deck searching for my ace
I can't take too many chances
Ain't much love in the place
Full of torment and soul and its written all in my face
Problems inside quick to smile beyond the trace
A mission slightly incomplete
Misconceptions of success and defeat
I roam these dark streets alone
Searching for my homies, smokin' till I'm gone
When I kind of need someone to lay my burdens on

Chorus 2xVerse One: C-Bo

I was born in hell without a pistol
Now how can I survive with one live without a vest and 4-5?
Runnin from the Task Fo' but smashin for my cash
Bankin corners, hop it then I blast on their ass
See them piggies want me dead for sure or in the pen
Doin 10, instead of me in my Benz on some twins
Sippin Hen, smokin indica bomb
And keep my pedal to the metal til I'm high and gone
I know you rich niggas hate me, can I keep it real and feel this rap shit?
Didn't make me, got out the pen and flip the '97
Drop Mercedes, I'm the *?placenta?* of no love
Til the lord save me, straight thugs that'll dump slugs
Til they fuckin grave, mass murder motherfuckers to the front page
When we hit, we empty clips til we get paid
I've been a slave from my cradle to the grave
Nigga, fuck the world, I was raised in hell

Chorus: C-Bo

That's why we buck shit down and yell "Fuck the world!"
I'd rather die here in hell then die doin life in jail
But take the shot with a Mac 12, order hits on the *?pack tailed?*
]From the block to Wotts, we are thug niggas raised in hell
*repeat*

Verse Two: Big Syke

I'm bailin thru the set wit a 40, smokin a cigarette
Blastin my radio, oldie tunes by The Marvalettes
Gangbangin vets on parole as I stroll thru
They rassle Gz like two craps and they strapped too
Oh how I love these niggas but I hate em with a passion
But I ride for these motherfuckers, when I don't even ask
Thug fashion from head to toe, I let the world know
That this is Thug Life, motherfucker, til I leave this ho
So as my knuckles drag the concrete, big homies hit the streets
Transgressions under pressure, preyin on the weak
I sink like a fish, I wish upon a ghetto star
If the enemies come thru and ride on me they won't get far
Big homey got out, hold 22's on a hang
Runnin around, sweatin motherfuckers, talkin bout "Let's throw them thangs"
Bang, I hit him with a bat and heard his skull crack
Then I got *?him the wind in the trach?* til he shattered, to get the Mac

Chorus

Verse Three: C-Bo

It ain't no love for bitch niggas
As I dump slugs and pull the plug on you bitch niggas
Pick up my phone and have some thugs hit you trick niggas
Wit on gloves or low tommy guns on them stitch niggas
Hit niggas with H-K's, split niggas with AK's when we mash for the cash
Doin a hundred, blastin buck shots off in that ass
True outlaws ready for war, souls will never die
The same day we meet death, the same day we ride
Dumpin slugs with Tek 9's, more bulletproofs my 4-5
I just let em fly, screamin out "Bitch nigga die"
We's about be a killer nigga, look outside
Tell me one reason why I should pray for eternal life
Born and taught in hell, with a gun store on every corner
Bodyguard, bulletproof doors, it's hard to be a goner
Strapped with heat, these West Coast streets of Killafornia
From day one, they have straps on em, cos we was raised in hell

Chorus(Rule number one... niggas die, daily, hahahaha)
Hear me! Boo-yaow!
(Ready for whatever, hell yeah
What type nigga be a Thug Life nigga?
Them Thug Life niggas be the craziest -- run up nigga!)

[2Pac]
There's no way to survive in the city it's a shame
Niggas die from my hollow-point bullet to the brain
Will I survive or will I die is what I wonder
Puffin on blunts and gettin drunk to keep from goin under
Gettin lost in the madness, blunted gettin tipsy
Got my pistol out the window screamin, "Lord come and get me"
Am I sick, or am I just another victim?
Unloadin my clip, I'm watchin every bullet spit when I kick em
Niggas die from automatic gunfire
Your time to expire, nobody cry every man gotta die
When they bury me, they bury me a G
Rest in peace, to all the homies got to heaven before me
Pour some liquor on the curb for the niggas that's caught
Had a motherfuckin warrant but he didn't go to court
God damn, and one day we'll all be together
Until then I'm ready for whatever, c'mon

(Yeah, niggas movin somethin in the nine-trey
It's all about makin money, gettin yours
And knockin coppers off the motherfuckin planet
Word to the motherfuckin nine nigga
We gonna make this motherfucker ours
If they don't feel me, they gon kill me
So Syke, get skanless nigga)

[Big Syke]
Am I going to Hell or will I reach Heav-en? (hell naw)
After all this shit I did with my Mac-11
Did I sell my soul? Mama woulda saved me
That's the way that daddy raised me
Oh God, help me I'm losin it
So fuck it! Take me I'm doin it!
I need to change and look for a better way
I got a hundred round clip to my AK
Commitin sins I might die in vain
So fuck it! We'll live off the street fame!
God didn't send me in the right direction
I'm gettin hit by a diesel in the intersection
I know you're out there help a young brother (hear me)
Til then I'mma smoke motherfuckers
Things wouldn't be so bad
If we got the things that we never had, I'm ready for whatever

(Hahahahaha, that's my motherfuckin nigga there
Big ballin-ass Syke
Yeah nigga, you schooled them young bustas
On how it is to be a real motherfuckin G
In the nine-trey motherfuckers is dyin daily so you best be packin
If you ain't, boo-yaow motherfucker!)

[2Pac]
Dear mama I know you worry cause I'm hardly at home
Every other night in jail, got you patient by the phone
Wanna shake it cause I can't take it got me livin in Hell
Like I'm walkin with a secret that'll kill me if I tell
I live the Thug Life and can't nobody, change me
Not to the brain, going insane, just a part of the game
So much pain in the fast lane, finally a dry eye
When I die, bury me with my fo'-five
And let the devil feel the wrath of a nigga
Goin to Hell with my finger on the trigger
Now everybody's starin
Got a nigga losin hair and they wonder if I'm all there
Well don't blame me, blame the flame that flickers
When niggas gettin richer (mo' money)
Now tell me if you wanna live forever
Niggas dyin so be ready for whatever

(Yeah, ready for whatever
Ready for whatever
Thug Life niggas and we be ready for whatever
Let me go like this, ready for whatever
Huh, Big Syke he be ready for whatever
My nigga Kato, ready for whatever
Pain, he's ready for whatever
And my nigga Bam Bam, he ready for whatever
My nigga Banks just be ready for whatever

Charlie Tango, ready for whatever
My nigga Pac, be ready for whatever
Yeah, ready for whatever
Ready for whatever
My big-ballin ass nigga Boom, ready for whatever fo' sho'

I know you standin there confused
You wonderin -- what type of nigga is a Thug Life nigga?
Yeahehehehe nigga, we be the ballin player-ass nigga
About gettin riches, bitches, and plenty loc
Ya hear me?)

Ready for whatever[Syke talking]
*laughing*
Shit, yeah
Yeah, beam me up
The only thing on earth
That can find a satelite nigga
Is a black superman
(Above The Law)

Verse 1:

See I dwell in the land where nobody else can understand
How I feel the need to increase my speed
I keep my shit on potent while I'm ignoring
Punk motherfuckas, KMG, westcoastin'
Do what I'ma have tos
So you can catch the essence of this black brother
Caught up in the rapture
I bend a corner in the mist, (Str8 up)
On the low rider town
Chop a chicken deal wid it
Satelite niggas, all up in ya home town
Cultivatin' and waitin' to put this California grind down
Yeah and it just don't stop
Got that S on my chest
And my five hundred out the shop
Laced wit twenties livin', lovely
Indo to drug me
Beverley rats to rub me
And I think that I'll never go legit
Long as, California keep pushin' that bomb shit

Hook:
Satelite niggas gotta ball
While the willies lay and pray for our downfall
We slide worldwide, rollin' memorising
Cookie hungry hoes keep despizing

Verse 2: Big Syke

Remember me I got kis comin' from overseas
Ain't no fleas around these clockin' Gs
From LA to North Carolina you will find a
Satelite nigga big wheeler wid all kinda
Rem-edies to kill poverty inflation level
Street degrees to Gs, congratulations to several
Thug scholars we honor cause you made it out baller
Street clout, fuck what they talkin' about, shot callers
We need, to kill the greed of the starvin' youth
Substitute game from loot and what you plan to shoot
The stupid niggas get disciplined, but listen when
Incarcerated hated enemies in the state pen
Evil grin on faces all day cases evolve
So they'll never solve, high speed chases
Better paces is near, have no fear in your eyes
Keep praying to the skies for the prize
Satelite niggas

Hook(2x)

Verse 3:

Now I'ma take y'all back like some ole school Parliament shit
Like rollin' Zenith and doin' small time licks
Picture this, I was on the highway
Wid fifteen chickens in the trunk
Ready to get my endz ready to dump
Do y'all remeber when that jeep was thirteen five
When we had just setup shop out Lil Rock
We did the double back flip that shit easy
Then we took some homies up to Detroit
And some down to Tennessee
Cause that's the way its gotta be
Yo smooth like Goldie
Mack like Billy D
Because satelite niggas come in all shapes and sizes
Big like Willy tall like high risers
Rollin' stretch 5 double Os, pimpin' L-dogs
Blowin' smoke on them 20-inch mo mos
I asked the homies what'll be next
They already pimpin' and fuckin' on the internet
Yo, so keep your game sugar free
Like the black superman satelite nigga O-G, uh
And ya don't stop
Yo, I say, and ya don't quit
Yeah, in this life this
It don't take nuthin' for me to play a bitch
And I'm out.... Above the Law y'all

Hook (2x)
