Longtime mi watch ya mi wha chat to ya
And ya a gwaan like ya nuh wha chat to me
So whappn Dre tell em whe di fuck a gwaan nuh

[Verse 1]
Creeping down the back street on D's
I got my Glock cocked, cause niggas want these
No soon as I said it, seems I got sweated
By some nigga with a TEC-9, trying to take mine
You wanna make noise, make noise
I make a phone call
My niggas coming like the Gotti boys
Bodies being found on Greenleaf
With their fucking heads cut off
Motherfucker, I'm Dre
So listen to the play-by-play, day-by-day
Rolling in my '4 with 16 switches
And got sounds for the bitches
Clocking all the riches
Got the hollow points for the snitches
So would you just walk on by
Cause I'm too hard to lift
And no, this ain't Aerosmith
It's the motherfucking D-R-E
From the C-P-T
On a rhyming spree, a straight G
Hop back as I pop my top, you trip
I let the hollow points commence to pop, pop, pop
Yeah, cause if it don't stop
I have to put my shit in reverse
Go back and take another spot

[Pre-Hook 1: Snoop Dogg]
Cause I'm rolling in my 6-4
(With all the niggas, sayin')

[Hook 1: Jewell (Dr. Dre)]
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
(Hell yeah)
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
(With all the niggas saying)
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
(Hell yeah)
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride

[Verse 2]
Just another motherfucking day for Dre, so I begin like this
No medallions, dreadlocks or black fists
It's just that gangsta glare
With gangsta raps
That gangsta shit
Makes a gangs of snaps
(Uh, word to the motherfucking streets)
And word to these hyped ass lyrics and dope beats
That I hit you with
That I get you with
As I groove in my '4 on D's
Hitting the switches
Bitches relax, while I get my proper swerve on
Bumping like a motherfucker ready to get my serve on
But before I hit the dope spot
Gotta get the chronic
The Remy Martin and my soda pop
Now I'm smelling like indo-nesia
Bus stop full of fly bitches and skeezers
On my dick cause my '4 on hit
Pancake, front and back, side to side, and all that shit
So when I crawl, I comes correct
Now, if your bitch in my shit, it's your bitch you check, nigga
Now let the Chevrolet slide
As I dip, a nigga trip to the south side
Yeah


[Pre-Hook 2: Snoop Dogg (Dr. Dre)]
Rolling in my 6-4
(With all the bitches saying)

[Hook 2: Jewell (Dr. Dre)]
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
(Hell yeah)
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
(With all the motherfucking bitches saying)
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
(Know what I'm saying?)
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride

[Verse 3]
Check this out
The sun went down when I hit Slauson
On my way to the strip
Now I'm just flossin'
Checking my rearview
Cause niggas, they will do
Jack moves, black fools cause I smack fools
Try to set me up for a 2-11
Fuck around and get caught up in a (1-8-7)
But I don't represent no gangbang
Some niggas like lynching
But I just watch 'em hang
So on and so on
Why don't you let me roll on?
I remember back in the days when I used to have to get my stroll on
Didn't nobody wanna speak
Now everybody peeping out they window
When they hear me beating up the street
("Is it Dre? Is it Dre?")
That's what they say
Every single motherfucking day
Yo, but I ain't tripping, I'm just kicking it
While my D's keep spinning and these hoes keep grinning I be

[Pre-Hook 3: Snoop Dogg (Dr. Dre)]
Rolling in my 6-4
(With everybody saying)

[Hook 3: Jewell and Parliament-Funkadelic (Dr. Dre)]
Swing down, I wanna ride
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
(Hell yeah)
Swing down, I wanna ride

(With everybody saying)
Swing down, I wanna ride
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride

Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
Swing down, I wanna ride
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride[Hook: RBX]
Remember me? Seven executions
Remember me? I have no remorse
Remember me? I'm high powered
Remember me? I drop bombs like Hiroshima

[Verse 1: RBX]
For this one it's the X; you retarded?!
Cause I grab the mic and get Down like syndrome
Hide and roam into the masses
Without boundaries, which qualifies me
For the term universal, without no rehearsal
I leak words that's controversial
Like I'm not the one you wanna contest, see
Cause I'll hit your ass like the train did that bitch
That got banned from TV, heavyweight hitter
Hit you watch your whole head split up
Loco is the motion, we comin' through
Hollow tips is the lead, the forty-five threw

[Hook: Sticky Fingaz]
Remember me? Throw ya gunz in the air
Remember me? Slam, Slam
Remember me? Nigga, bacdafucup
Remember me? Chka-chka-Onyx

[Verse 2: Sticky Fingaz]
Niggas that take no for an answer, get told "no"
Yeah, I been told no, but it was more like "no, no, no"
Life's a bitch, met her, fuck you if you let her
Better come better than better to be a competitor
This vet is ahead of the shit is all redder, you deader and deader
A medic instead of the cheddars and credda
Settle vendetta with metal beretta from ghetto to ghetto
Evidence, nope, never leave a shred-of
I got the soul of every rapper in me, love me or hate me
My mom's got raped by the industry and made me
I'm the illest nigga ever, I told you
I get more pussy than them dyke bitches Total
Want beef, nigga? Pbbt, you better dead that shit
My name should be Can't-Believe-That-Nigga-Said-That-Shit
Probably sayin' he ain't a killer, but I'm killin' myself
Smoke death, fuck bitches raw, on the kitchen floor
So think what I'mma do to you, have done to you
Got niggas in my hood who'd do that shit for a blunt or two
What you wanna do? cocksuckers, we Glock busters
'til the cops cuff us, we'll start ruckus and drop blockbusters
Round the clock hustlers, you cannot touch us
I'm getting wires niggas wanting me dead, wanting my head
You think it could be something I said ?

[Hook: Eminem]
Remember me? I just don't give a fuck
Remember me? Yeah, fuck you too
Remember me? I'm low down and I'm shifty
Remember me? I'm Shady

[Verse 3: Eminem]
When I go out, I'mma go out shooting
I don't mean when I die, I mean when I go out to the club, stupid
I'm tryna clean up my fuckin' image so I promised the fuckin' critics
I wouldn't say fuckin' for six minutes (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)
My baby's mom, bitch made me an angry blonde
So I made me a song, killed her and put Hailie on
I may be wrong, I keep thinking these crazy thoughts
In my cranium, but I'm stuck with a crazy mom
(Is she really on as much dope as you say she's on)
Came home, and somebody musta broke in the back window
And stole two loaded machine guns and both of my trenchcoats
Sick, sick dreams of picnic scenes
Two kids, sixteen with M-16's and ten clips each
And them shits reach through six kids each
And Slim gets blamed in Bill Clint's speech to fix these streets?
Fuck that, pbbt â€“ you faggots can vanish to volcanic ash
And reappear in hell with a can of gas and a match
Aftermath, Dre, grab the gat, show 'em where it's at
(What the fuck you staring at, nigga?)

[Outro]
Don't you remember me? Remember me?
Remember me? Remember me? (Slim Shady!)[Intro]
Six million ways to die, choose one

[Kurupt]
It's time to escape, but I don't know where the fuck I'm headed
Up or down, right or left, life or death
I see myself in a mist of smoke
Death becomes any nigga that takes me for a joke
We hit a five dollar stick, now we puttin in work
Unaccountable amounts of dirt, death becomes all niggas
Anybody killa, you know what the deal is
Nigga, you know what the real is

[Daz]
I see some mark brand niggas on the corner flaggin me down
Sayin, "Yo Daz, what's up with the Pound?
Is that nigga Snoop alright? Aiyyo what's up with the crew?
Is them niggas in jail, or are them niggas through?"
I said, "If you ain't up on thangs
Snoop Dogg is the name, Dogg Pound's the game"
It's like this they don't understand
It's an everyday thang, to gangbang
Make that twist, don't be a bitch, let these niggas know
What's up witchu I represent the Pound and Death Row
And can't no other motherfucker in L.A. or Long Beach
And Compton and Watts see D-O-G's
Now, you can't come and you can't run, and you can't
See long to the G of the gang
One gun is all that we need, to put you to rest
{Pump pump!} Put two slugs dead in your chest
Now you dead then a motherfucker creepin and sleepin
6 feet deep in, fuckin with the Pound is

[Bridge]
Suicide, it's a suicide
(Repeat x4)

[Snoop]
The cloud becomes black, and the sky becomes blue
Now you in the midst of the Dogg Pound crew
Ain't no clue, on why the fuck we do what we do
Leave you in a state of paranoia, oooh
Don't make a move for your gat so soon cuz
I drops bombs like Platoon (ay nigga)
Walk with me, hold my hand and let me lead you
I'll take you on a journey, and I promise I won't leave you
(I won't leave you) until you get the full comprehension
And when you do, that's when the mission
Or survival, becomes your every thought
Keep your eyes open, cuz you don't wanna be caught
Half steppin with your weapon on safety
Now break yourself motherfucker, 'fore you make me
Take this 211 to another level
I come up with your ends, you go down with the devil
Now roam through the depths of hell
Where the rest your busta ass homeboys dwell
Well

[Hook]
Suicide, it's a suicide
(Repeat x3)
Now tell me, what's my motherfuckin name?
Serial killa! Serial killa! Serial killa!
(Wake up in the morning eat your Lucky Charms cereal)

[RBX]
Deep, deep like the mind of Minolta, now picture this
Let's picnic inside a morgue
Not pic-a-nic baskets, pic-a-nic caskets
And I got the machine, that cracks your fuckin chest plates
Open and release them guts
Then I release def cuts
Brutal, jagged edged, totally ruffneck
Now everybody scream nuff respect to the X
Nuff respect given
Disrespect and you will not be livin
Word to momma, Emma, drama, dilemma

[Hook][Intro: Bushwick Bill]
Yes, it is I says me
And all who agree are more than three, cause they we
Yes, yo, I'm in the house now for sure
Because I wanna talk about the hearts of men
Who knows what evil lurks within them?
But let's take a travel down the blindside
And see what we find on this path, called

[Verse 1: Kurupt]
Stranded on Death Row, so duck when I swing my shit
I get rugged like Rawhead Rex with fat tracks that fits
The gangsta type, what I recite's kinda lethal
Niggas know, the flow that I kick, there's no equal!
I'm murderin' niggas, yo, and maybe because of the tone I kicks
When I grip the mic and kick shit niggas can't fuck with
So remember I go hardcore, and slam
'Nough respect like a sensei, whoop ass like Van Damme
So any nigga that claim they bossin'
What don't you bring your ass on over to Crenshaw and Slauson
Take a walk through the hood, and we up to no good
Slangin' 'em things like a real O.G. should
I'm stackin' and mackin' and packin' a ten so
When you're slippin', I slip the clip in, but ain't no set-tripppin'
Cause it's Death Row, rollin' like the mafia
Think about whoopin' some ass, but what the fuck stoppin' ya
Ain't nothin' but a buster
I'm "Stranded on Death Row" for pumpin' slugs in motherfuckers
Now you know you're outdone, feel the shotgun
Kurupt inmate cell block one

[Verse 2: RBX]
No prevention from this lynchin' of sorts
You're a victim, from my driveby of thoughts
No extensions, all attempts are to fail
Blinded by the light, it's time you learn braille
From the lunatic, I'm death like arsenic
When I kick a wicked rap, Dr. Dre will hit the scratch
With treachery, my literary form will blast
And totally surpass the norm
Not a storm, plural, make it, many storms
When I'm vexed, I fly leg necks and arms
In this dimension, I'm the presenter
And the inventor, and the tormentor
Deranged, like the Hillside Strangler
Emcee mangler, tough like Wrangler
I write a rhyme, hard as concrete
Step to the heat and get burned like mesquite
So what you wanna do
The narrator RBX, cell block two

[Verse 3: The Lady of Rage]
Rage, lyrical murderer; "Stranded on Death Row"
And now I'm serving a - lifetime sentence
There'll be no repentance
Since it's the life that I choose to lead, I plead guilty
On all counts let the ball bounce where it may
It's just another clip into my AK
Buck them down with my underground tactics
Facts and stacks of clips on my mattress -
Bed frame there's another dead, bang
Laying lame put to shame, who's to blame
Me, the Lady of Rage, a woman comin'
From the D-E-A-T-H and R-O-W takin', no shit
So flip and you're bound to get dropped
It's 1-8-7 on motherfuckers, don't stop!
Handcuffed as I bust there'll be no debate
It's Rage, from Cell Block H

[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg]
Aiyyo steppin' through the fog and creepin' through the smog
It's the number one nigga from the hood Doggy Dogg
Making videos, now I stay in Hollywood
Bustin' raps for my snaps now they call me Eastwood
Dre is the doctor and my homey little nigga
Warren G is my hand and my hand's on the trigga
Shootin' at the hoes with the game that I got
Sent to Death Row cause I wanted to make a grip from serving my rocks
And I'm still, serving for mines, peace
To my motherfucking homies doin time
In the pen and the county jail
Mobbin with your blues on, mad as hell
And you sayin', "Fuck the Police!"
And all the homies on the streets is all about peace
And it's driving the cops crazy
But ain't nothin' but a black thing bay-bee, uhh
Uhh, I'm not flaggin', but I'm just saggin'
I betcha don't wanna see the D-O double G
And you can't see, the D-R to the E
Or my motherfuckin' homey D.O.C
You know you can't fuck with my motherfuckin DJ
That's my homey and we call him Warren G
Yeah, and you don't stop
Doggy Dogg break 'em down with the motherfuckin' Dogg Pound
That's the only way we'll beat 'em man
We gotta smoke 'em, then choke 'em like the motherfuckin Peterman!
It's like three and to the two and two and to the one
Cell block four peace Doggy Dogg's done

[Outro: Bushwick Bill]
Yo, now you know the path I'm on
You think you're strong, see if you can travel on
Cause only the weak, will try to speak
Those who are quiet, will always cause riots
There's three types of people in the world
Those who don't know what happened
Those who wonder what happened
And people like us from the streets that MAKE things happen[Intro]
"I'ma say this and I'mma end mine. If you ain't down, for the Africans here in the United States, period point-blank. If you ain't down for the ones that suffered in South Africa from apartheid and shit, dammit, you need to step your punk ass to the side and let us brothers, and us Africans, step in and start puttin some Foot, in that ass!"

Break 'em off some (x8)

[Hook: Snoop] (x2)
I got my finger on the trigger, some niggas wonder why
But livin' in the city, it's do-or-die

[Verse 1: Daz]
Dem wonder why me violent and no really understand
For de reason why me take me law in me own hand
Me not out for peace and me not Rodney King
De gun goes click, me gun goes bang
Dem riot in Compton and dem riot in Long Beach
Dem riot in L.A. cause dem no really wanna see
Niggas start to loot and police start to shoot
Lock us down at seven o'clock, barricades us like Beirut
Me don't show no love cause it's us against dem
Dem never ever love me cause it's sport to break dem
And kill, at my own risk, if I may
To lay, to spray, with my AK, and put it to rest

[Interlude]

[Female reporter:] "Yes we have...there have been riots, ah uh, rioting. Well I don't wanna say rioting, but there's been looting downtown. But right now Bree, what I want to show you is, they have started fires down at the end of the street"

[All] How many niggas are ready to loot?
[Snoop] Yeah, so what you wanna do?
[Dre] What you wanna do?
[All] I said, how many niggas are ready to loot?

[KRS-One] Got myself an Uzi and my brother a 9

[In background:]
That's what they told us today
In other words, you still a slave
No matter how much money you got, you still ain't shit

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Sitting in my living room, calm and collected
Feeling that gotta-get-mine perspective
Cause what I just heard, broke me in half
And half the niggas I know, plus the niggas on the Row is bailing
Laugh now but cry much later
You see when niggas get together
They get mad cause they can't fade us
Like my niggas from South Central, Los Angeles
They found that they couldn't handle us
Bloods, Crips on the same squad
With the ese's help and, nigga, it's time to rob and mob
(And break the white man off something lovely, biddy-bye-bye
I don't love dem so dem can't love me)
Yo, straight puttin' it down, gettin' my scoot on
It's jumping off in Compton so I gots to get my loot on
And come up on me some furniture or somethin'
Got a VCR in the back of my car
That I ganked from the Slausson Swap Meet
And motherfuckers better not try to stop me
Cause they will see that I can't be stopped
Cause I'ma cock my Glock and pop til they all drop

[Interlude]

[Female reporter:]
"Yes, on the videotape we seem to have the, ah, people in the crowd throwing things at the officers."

[Male reporter:]
"And swinging at them as well, as a result a young woman there, you see took a swing at at an officer with some object in her hand."

[All] How many niggas are ready to loot?
[Snoop] Yeah, so what you wanna do?
[Dre] What you wanna do?
[All] I said, how many niggas are ready to loot?

[KRS-One] Got myself an Uzi and my brother a 9

[Hook]

[Verse 3: RBX]
One-Time trigger happy, no nigga love
One-eighty-seven time, time to grab the glove
Can't get prints on a 9 I throw away
Or get prints on my Uzi when it spray
POP-POP, POP, another motherfucker drop
And I get relief like, plop, plop, fizz
Smash, I crashed his head like a window
I ain't Nintendo, I'm high off the indo
Creepin', with the quickness to the cut
Bust one to his head while he munches on a donut
And crack-up, so now he best to back up
I guess I gots to pack up, filling the clip up
I zip up-town but motherfuckin' cops are all around
Helicopters flyin', these motherfuckers tryin'
To catch me and stretch me on Death Row
But hell no, suppose black refuse to go

[Interlude]

[Male reporter:] "This is now covering a very, very wide area of Los Angeles where these fires have been, ah, ignited. I mean, from here to the, ah, to the south end of South Central is a long way."

Break 'em off some (x8)

[Verse 4: Daz]
The outcome of this is destruction, so them all fall
Niggas don't give a fuck, so them bust and them fall
The, description of three blacks
Shows no justice, so, pick up it's your right
If you riot again, me, turn the other cheek
We, be too many, me got, me nine to my side
So me bust, flick, cause he don't give a fuck
And me don't give a fuck
And all my problems end with that BUCK-BUCK

[Outro: Snoop]
Blam, blam, blam til dem fall
Listen to the shots from my nigga Doggy Dogg, biddy-bye
Dr. Dre, him bust gun shots
Diggidy Daz and RBX, dem bust gun shots
Come again![Intro]
This should be played at high volume
Preferably in a residential area

[Verse 1 - The Lady of Rage]
Now I'mma kick up -- dust, as I begin to bust
On the wick-wack, fucked up suckers ya can't trust
When I kick up, I lick up, your face get smacked up
When I rack up, so all you motherfuckers just pack up
Or get slapped with the swiftness
If you think you're swift with the gift Merry Christmas
Now stuff that in your stockin'
I'm knockin' em out the box 'n'
Knocking em out their socks 'n', cause Robin is rockin'
Breaking em down to the -- slab
Taking em down on their -- ass
Now what you wanna do, ya wanna battle, uh?
Send you up shit creek without a motherfucking paddle
Rattle -- that brain, I'm not that same ol' plain Jane
Roll on you like a boulder, you're nothin' more than a grain
Or a pebble, take it from the real rap rebel
Not Bushwick Bill but I can take it to 'That Other Level'
You think you got pull? Then pull it, uh!
I got the trigger so I figure you'll bite the bullet
Then bite the dust and wipe the fuss
Do what I must, and what I must - is bust
The bubble, or two some trouble, for you
So skip to my Luger, Lady of Rage is comin' through

{*cut n scratch* "Some cool shit" 2X*}
{*"Boo-yaa! Spittin' out buckshots" -> B-Real*}

[Verse 2 - Kurupt]
I fears no one, I makes 'em cool off like a polar cat
Lynching, as a hit, misses the roll of dice
Pushing packs to make a profit
Diggy dope duck on the topic so stop and gimme my props, kid
I'm livin' large like a fat bitch
So get back, bitch, I'm hard to bogart, for the faggots
This young black kid, a mercenary, merciless
Murderin' millions of niggas so who's first to diss
They say I'm bad so you'll find none worse than this
Chewing motherfuckers up like a Hershey Kiss
Put to sleep, loving the lyrics I leave in the minds of each
Rough when flex, too complex, wrecks your mental piece
So feel the wrath, nigga, I rip in half niggas
You're quick to talk shit, I whoop your ass nigga
Then watch me blast, nigga, cause I'm the last nigga
You wanna fuck wit, so up your cash, nigga
I make em stagger, I'm scandalous as Jimmy Swaggart
I'm a good tracker, scoping your girl then watch me tag her
Pulling steel like a stunt
Shown like an ID card, nigga, no needs to front, so
Here to torment I put track on crack
And I'm strapped with a semi-tone mili-ten Mac
Yo, I breaks em off, I breaks em off, chief
Deadly as Jason on Friday the 13th

{"A to the motherfuckin' K"}

[Verse 3 - RBX]
Back in the days, niggas they use to scrap
But now in ninety-two, niggas they pull their strap
Cause umm, police them come wicked and them shoot
Niggas, so niggas retaliate and start to loot, execute.
Boot-stomping
Black soldier, here to teach and mold ya
The innovator, dominater, narra-rator
R-B to the motherfuckin' X -- flex wicked
Styley Lee, bump and be found and do bleed by a
Maniac, with a gat
See nowadays niggas is like that
I pull my trigger back, the bullets go
BO! BO! BO! Now I'm on Death Row
Fuck it, niggas going wild
Every night they shoot, it's like Beirut
Maybe you should get a Kevlar vest for your chest
Anytime steppin' through my hood
But that'll do you no good
One slug to your face, don't hate
You're gettin' smoked like wood
Nasty nigga bloody pumps face flat
On the concrete, here comes the white sheet
Mr. Coroner, caught with some yellow tape
But, the murderers escape
Audi like 5 G's
Lyrical gangbang but it's just a G thang[Intro]
"You really don't understand, do you? Hey man, don't you realize that, in order for us to make this thing work, we gotta get rid of the pimps, and the pushers, and then start all over again clean."

Nigga, is you crazy?!
Once again, the mighty Death Row organization committin' mass murder, and we ain't askin' for shit, nigga; we takin' it! So Dre, BLAST they ass. nigga!

[Verse 1]
Rat-tat-tat-tat late at night with my gat
On the streets of LA
Wonderin' where the pussy at
Straight player, looking for a ho
Hangin' out, rollin' in my '64
16 switches for the niggas in my hood
17 shells so I make it understood
Stay back, lay back, way back in the cut
Ya come outside nigga ya gettin' fucked up
But I told ya, Creep, Creep ya best move
Like Luther Vandross, fuckin' up the west coast
I'm right back up in ya when ya nut
1-2-3 nut, from the D-R-E but
This is for the hoes that I used to know
When I didn't have my '64 and a lot of dough
I keep ya this and like that

[Hook]
And I...
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back
Rat-tat-tat-tat tat ta tat like that, and I..
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back
Rat-tat-tat-tat tat ta tat like that, and I...
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back

[Interlude]
Oh wait, that's that nigga that owe ya that grip
Yeah there that fool is
Break him off proper than
What's up, what's happenin' ?
Nigga you delinquent, can I get those ends?
Nigga, pay this nigga, he ain't trippin'
[I ain't got yo money]
Well, yo, check this out, nigga
What's up *slaps around some guy that owes them money*
What's up?
What's up?
Ya motherfucker
[I'll be back, yo! I'll be back!]
Ya, you ain't never comin' back!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Creepin' and peepin' and I can get with these
The chronic, slangin' fat ki's from my block
And it don't stop
Tell me where ya wanna go
To the strip
Or take a trip bawlin' with the row
My shit off in ya system attacks
Endo smoke in ya lungs, like that
You get lifted, calm, and if it's da bomb
Taken away like Calgon on Vietnam
California, back and on a mission, makin' a point
Ain't no fuckin' competition
They wishin' but run up on reality
CPT, CAL my locality
It's strange how I re-arrange and change the business
By droppin' shit like this
Dope, niggas can't cope with the real
I peal, penitentiaries still, when I kill it goes...

[Hook]

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Straight up. Now you niggas know where my homie comin' from
So quit the chit-chat, before ya find yourself flat on your bizzack, fool
It's 9-duce, Dr Drizzay, is sittin' on tizzop! It don't stop
Treatin' buster's like a punk-ass cizzop!
BIAATTCHHH![Verse 1]
Doc-tor Dre, do you remember you was broke
And the whole rap industry thought ya was a joke?
Me, D.O.C., and D.O.G., sat and made
Lyrics to replenish your name like Gatorade
But you got thirsty for the money! Punk
And disrespect the three that put ya back up on it
Always talkin bout, your word good as gold
Wash, fold, put it out to dry, cause you lie
I put that on my momma and my mate
And if I'm makin this up, let my momma head lay
So fool you know I'm comin on the rizzeal
The way you played me, you deserve a smack to Brazil
ILL, the way you played your brother Warren G
You best to check yourself, next time you talk about Ea-zy
?Stip Wometn? the new Jerry Heller
Dre's the company, so to me, he like Eazy
Snoop D-O-G, is like the old D.O.C
Puttin all work, gettin all jerked
Does that make me Ice Cube of the place, Steady Mobbin
While Dre (Death Row) steady robbin? Ohh
And what, fool, steady squabbin?
Dogg Pound givin doubled up on lumps
So here you feel froggy jumps when I rear back
Compact Glock forty Glock dumps
BLAOW, how you like me now?
But it ain't Moe Dee it's me, the X
Now rated RBX, and yo
If you didn't know, escape from Death Row

[Hook]
Remember me? Seven execution
Remember me? I have no remorse
Remember me? I'm high, powered
Remember me? I drop bombs like Hiroshima!
(RBX is A.W.O.L.) I drop bombs like Hiroshima! [2X]
"And if ya don't know... and if ya...
And if ya don't know, now you know, nigga"

[Verse 2]
I killed him too quick to fuckin think about it
RBXtra, Xtra, read about it
Tell me what ya thought fool, huh, what?
Now I'm pissed off in all black in the cut
Fool walks by, eh-heh, BOOM!
Cops said I killed him but they can only assume
Never found no damn murder weapon, I'm steppin
X, X, the X
X-con, X-ecution, X mark the spot
Flip it around, and the mark gets shot
And I'm gon take it out with this light it's mighty
Across your face, you see the red lights
Now you ain't got no face no more
Bullet, rip that body, tore, collapse
Then I kick the tricky raps
X, Xtra, Xtra X-termination
Here is the presentation
Haven't you ever heard of a killer?
Killer killer illa, like Magilla Gorilla illa
Then deadly medly murder with a pen
And you can't cross out a X, nigga
Got my itchy itchy finger on the trigga
BUST, bodybag, and crush
Trust, flush, down the toilet
In other words you ain't shit
You be talkin that ill, you ain't a killa for real, really doe
I know, and now I let you know (busta!)
RBX is A.W.O.L., escape from Death Row

[Hook][Intro]
{*scratching* "To the Batmobile - let's go!"}
"Atomic batteries to power, turbines to speed"
"Roger, ready to move out"

[During Hook - theme song repeats the "Batman!" music + vocals]

[Hook: Lady of Rage & RBX]
No one, can save the day like Batman
Robin, will make you sway like that and
Beat for beat, rhyme for rhyme
Deep in Gotham, fightin crime
No one, can save the day like Batman

[RBX]
Commissioner X here!
Batman & Robin, we have a bit of a problem
There's trouble brewing in Gotham City
You MUST act fast!

[Lady of Rage] + (Snoop)
Holy mackerel Batman! I think these clowns need to back down
Let's be the Gap Band and drop the bomb on 'em and make 'em SCAT man
(When you say scat man, like the Brother Cuh-rothers?) Uh-huh
(When it's on, it's cold, so bring the coroner cover)
We can take it to the Bassment, live with Tigger
Go get The Riddler, and watch me play that nigga like a fiddler
On a hot tin roof, I got them watchin who?
She who spits it like she was sippin rot-ten brew, ooh
(We Marvel at you Comics, you ain't no Superhero)
You just a stupid zero, you ain't hard like DeNiro

[Snoop Dogg] + (Rage)
Surprise! The Dynamic Duo
Batman & Robin, gats set for squabbin (nigga!)
Splat! Hit 'em like forty-five shells (nigga!)
Plaque! Means more than one million sales (huh)
That's nuff shot to lick, you get done up
Plus we got the Bat gats, so why would you run up? (huh)

"Batman! Batman! Batman."
{*scratched: "And you're about to find out"*}

[Hook]

{*scratched: "And you're about to find out"*}

[Lady of Rage]
Yeah, when it's beef in Gotham City I, gots to flip and
Hit 'em with the POW! BAM! BIFF! Whoa
Pick up your lips, don't trip, tie your shoelace
When I spit, I split it, turn Harvey Dent into Two-Face
Robin, I'm more than a sidekick, I'm more like the livest
They wanna go head up and collide
And like collision, hope your moms made provisions
See you ain't got no wins baby, not even a smidgen
Mad hostility dealt, now I'mma really be felt
Switch on my utility belt, make yo' facility melt
I go Mad on yo' Hatter, watch yo' whole shit splatter
Get, wicked on yo' case like Detective Van Adder
So the, sayin goes, if you snooze you lose
Trust you do, me and Batman the Dynamic Two!

[Hook]

[Snoop Dogg]
Cold day in Gotham in the Bat Cave chillin
Catnip for Catwoman so she caught the feeling
Huh, talk about flavor for a Pringle
A favor for a favor maybe later we can mingle
Damn, just then, the Bat Phone ringin
They hoo-bangin' in Gotham, I got to do my thing

[RBX]
Batman! War is on the brink
It seems that the Penguin is causing a stink
Call up Robin quick, you know what to do
Add dye to the water and splash the town blue

[Snoop Dogg]
Shit I'm there in a flash, Batmobile on 3's
Trust me buddy, got heat for Mr. Freeze
And Clayface will catch the em-brace
Of napalm when I drop my Bat Bomb
.. and don't you forget it
Takin out you suckers and you don't know how I did it

[Outro]
No one, can save the day like Batman
Robin, will make you sway like that and
Beat for beat, rhyme for rhyme
Deep in Gotham, fightin crime
No one, can save the day like Batman
Robin, will make you sway like that and
Beat for beat, rhyme for rhyme
Deep in Gotham, fightin crime

[Lady of Rage]
Dirty Dinkins Batman!
Did you see those crispy khaki creases on that rugged wretched..

[Snoop Dogg]
Aiy-yo-yo-yo kick back Robin
Get Alfred and tell him to have barbecued buffalo wings
And a pitcher of Kool-Aid on chill
It's about to get real in the field

[Lady of Rage]
Leapin Lo-lo's! Over there Batman! That's a no-no!
Let's hop out this fo'-do'!

[Snoop Dogg]
Yea yea yea, systems engaged
Start the Bat Engine, hit the Bat Switches
You ready Robin? Let's dip

[Lady of Rage]
Let's, dip! Holy Hoodrat Sally smokin' crack in the alley
Let's, dip! I mean, crazy kinfolk in Kingsville Batman!
We must, we MUST Batman, listen to me
Holy Leapin Lizards and Gizzards and all that shit that come with it
And potatoes on top with gravy in the middle
God damnit Batman! {*echoes*}

Nah the member X but you'll remember X indeedy
Now remember don't contest the flex
Got you in spot like Lindscrafter but you try to diss

After that you'll get nothing from me but laughter
Similar to this: HA. What's the repertoire-kick deadly wit' lyrics
Shot your punk ass like ELEC now it's

CHORUS

[Daz]
Make room for the dope dealer, pimp and the gangsta
I'm a Dogg, baby girl that's my nature
Don't be a stranger, get your head knocked off
Just for bein scary on the contrary what I posess is necessary
From the scratch whip it up, baking soda, yola
It's real here homey and I come from the shoulder
I'm a Dogg Pound original, subliminal criminal
It goes me bein an individual, so invisible
And sensible, thinkin that your shit get thought up
Now you're in a world of heat, that's when you're caught up
Brought up around marks and busters
Ain't no G'ness, this is the reason why I kept it
Daz Dilli', mac milli' stay on deck
With a proper dose, got to connect - you know it's West coast
Home of the gun smoke, now you know
So get your vest homeboy cause we 'bout to blow

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
O.G. don't sweat it, on the real don't sweat it
I swear they gon' get it, I swear they gon' get it
I don't know why they said it, but they never shoulda said it
Shoot 'em in the face and leave they ass half-headed
Shells embedded, read it, red it
Lead it, wet it, get it...
Doctors can't save him from gettin it
D.P.G.C. nigga don't ever fo'get it

[RBX]
Fuck what they said and fuck what you heard
Dogg Pound Gangsta, nigga that's the word
Act like you know us, I know you do
Back, all in your face like BOO~!
The iller killer like Thrilla in Manilla
The D-Roc keep snow like caterpillar
Seems you better duck when the ooh heat rollin
"Anybody killa" mean everybody DEAD
Get that, for what it's worth
Big guns, big funds represent this turf (L.B.C.)
Some scream the West but don't rep it right
So when it's time to step they come steppin light
If they step at all, pow
Lead slide through they thinkin cap, they fall
What you was thinkin cap?
With all that gangsta fantasy in your stinkin rap

[Hook]

[Kurupt]
Nigga, Kurupt - Kurupt's beyond the stars
Ever since 17 when I was liftin cars
Came in this motherfucker just to see who you are
I'm sturdy as mountains, rhymes float like canoes
Rivers and fountains, I'm high as eagles
Dogg Pound Gangstas livin life illegal
You want the 9, the K or the Eagle
Either one you choose, niggas liftin out they shoes
Prayin mayne, it's a war to step in the door
Tentacles stretch across the wall and floor
I'm.. I'm.. I'm off that white arviendo{?}
I silence your homies and shatter your windows
Take a look at my secret window
Cause I got a secret your life depend on
Kurupt, Young Hannibal
My mind got me feelin like firin iron

[Hook]

[Outro]
Wa-oooh, wa-ooohooh-ooh-ooh
Wa-oooh, wa-ooohooh-ooh-ooh
Wa-oooh, wa-oohhooh-ooh-ooh
Wa-oooh, wa-oohhooh-ooh-ooh[Verse 1: Xzibit]

I'm a plastic surgeon, fix your face
I got Nascar novels, I was build to race
Gone the long hot summer, I was gone through space
It's the next best thing, making soda and base
It ain't the drill at a hun', it ain't the paper we're chasing
Or these bitches that you came to toot, is basically basic
I'm getting white boy wasted, I'm waking up with a porn star
She walking around naked like she my personal all star
I push one button and boom: "hey, baby, how can I serve you today? "
Pussy wet like a typhoon. Ass is unreal, it look like a cartoon
Immaculate backstroke, anal and deep throat
Whatever the fuck I want you get to make it happen
Powder her nose and she never take a break in the action
Shit, I'm about to miss my flight
First class to London, fucking with you all night

[Hook: Game]

Back up in this motherfucker, spending all my money in here
Because I don't care blowing kush in the air
Dropping car, feeling like spaceships
Riding with models and stripping ace in the club
Show international girls how to do it with dub
While my chain swing left to right
Came with the party with you, do it all night
My money never run out, we party 'till the sun out
We have Patron shots, so we know we're about to come out

[Verse 2: RBX]

Wes, uncut, welcome him home
From BJ to YJ, now the G grown
One click of the wrist, the competitor gone
Flight patrol on your turf like the predator drone, whoa
Not to mention pit bull bully
Razore edge bloodline, Nutro fed fully
Stupid, get it right, off the chain for the fight
One flash, green lights Run hit on sight
Let's go to war now, rock the Luger steady
Wake up to your nightmare, Freddy Krueger's ready
One finger slice, now you pay the price
Put your life on the line if you feel that nice
Cause running bullshit over here will get you shot
Stupid, I'm the truth that's everything you're not
X marks the spot, that's everything that's hot
And walk right upon you and run everything you got

[Hook: Game]

[Verse 3: Xzibit]

I, I, I hit 'em with a nuke, get the pussy
They're scared to shoot
My niggas get you with the 21 gun, salute
I paratroop to your city, hit the club, recruit
Let's see some titties
Boogie words for shitty birds, I learn from the smartest
Treat the bitch like a bitch, treat the queen like a goddess
I coast it, bum bought it, weighting me down
Sleight the razor to your throat, what can you say to me now?
This is dope out above law, thousands of pounds
Keep the crowd in a chokehold, deliver the rounds
I'm going from living with clowns to rocking a crown
It protect my self silence oppressed the sound
You was up a body violence, working jaw to the ground
Making how you got knocked down the talk of the town
Stick around for the fireworks, apocalypse now
Hear it out, make them dollars work, smoking that loud

[Hook: Game]East coast *killer*, West coast *killer* (repeat 8X)

Verse One: RBX

While childish MC's battle over coastal fronts
I come with no fronts and smash in monkey fronts
If you want to be evil like Knieval then jump
I guarantee your punk ass catch the speed lump
The tactics, extract, morbid thoughts from the mental
Custom designed, for instrumental
Yes indeedy, lyrical graffiti
And this one's a burner, baby
Truck, like Toyata driven
True and livin drivin with the gat
Uhh, pop the clutch, let the Cold Crush rush
Then I flush wack material
That's if I don't mash them all to mush
Hush, let me burst, dare I gush
Cock-diezel cuts
Lyrical arsenal equivalent to arsenic

East coast *killer*, West coast *killer* (repeat 4X)

Verse Two: KRS-One

Yo, why do they make me wanna ruin they career?
Before I bust your shit let's get one thing clear
Don't provoke Kris no joke this
I don't ride no rapper's nutsac yo I stay focused
Beefin without skills seekin will only weaken
The artist speakin over beats and, you be cheatin
Cacaphony of small talent rappers, claimin a coast
Over instrumentals, ain't got no real street credentials
Here come the philosopher hip-hopppin ya correctly
Ignorant ass MC's continue to tempt me
Lyrics be empty like Alcatraz cellblock
Too many MC's rappin causin lyrical gridlock
Lyrical syllables interlock in my voicebox
Yet I'm still unknown like the X on Sadat
Just your typical, non-topical
Flex the optical illusion weak metaphoric style you be usin
I check one-two's and who's in the house
Like shit your lyrics ooze out ya mouth
Whattyou think this is? KRS-One from the Bronx kid!

East coast *killer*, West coast *killer* (repeat 8X)

Welcome to the New World Order
You are now under martial law
All constituional rights have been suspended

Verse Three: B-Real

The most scandalous, cut the bad apple, we can handle this
Coast trippin goin on through out the business
East Coast West Coast anybody killer!
I don't give a fuck where you from I'mma Killa Hill-er
I got crews on both sides together
Deeper than the ocean and down for whatever
Fool I can roll through any block
From Central to Westland Avenue, without my Glock
But some niggas can't survive on both sides
So they try and break off, eliminate ties
Fools got to get wise, better realize
True, enemy lies killin in the highrise
Office, analyzing the song
Look at them red niggas, don't even get along
Kill that noise, four niggas bringin the skill
Mad caps get peeled if you oppose the Hill

Yeah that's right fool, you know who, the mighty Group Therapy
The mighty mighty Aftermath brigade, letting all you sound boys know
You're not ready to rumble or test this
Kill that noise!

East coast *killer*, West coast *killer (repeat 8X)

Verse Four: Nas

Now when I bomb like Sadaam, the world feels The Wrath of Khan
Desert Storm in this modern day Babylon
I be the twelve disciples strap arms
All black on running your spot hit the safe and I'm gone
Like a thief wrong, I keep the long 38 warm
Silent and calm, and blackout when the beef is on
Focus on your rap holsters, notice
I'm evil like the Exorcist to the locusts
Ferocious thoughts, emerging at night
Like Jehovah towards the virgin in white
I'm wrapped in a turban for spite
Like a Israelite snatchin hoes up, my flow's up
When the fuckin world blows up throw your hands up
It's a holdup, frontin like you down for the real
To make a meal, but when plan fold, nigga you squeal
Like Henry Hill, but what's the fuckin deal?

East coast *killer* West coast *killer* (repeat 16X)[Intro: Dr. Dre as The Vice President]
Gentlemen!! ~ We have a problem

Trigger, happy RBX to cap ya
PUMP PUMP, and I can't wait to bust a round
PUMP PUMP, my hollow point smacks the clown
Cause what I said split his head
And now they got me runnin from the Feds
But I refuse to go alive
It's kill or be killed, that's how real niggas survive
I'm high powered!

[Daz]
Yeah!
It's Daz that mass-murderin' motherfucker
So what you feel like you wanna get caught up?
Fool you better recognize
Death Row came to chastise
So if you cross the Row
Remember the first name is Death
No love for the other side[Produced by Dr. Dre]

[Verse 1]
Creeping down the back street on D's
I got my Glock cocked, cause niggas want these
No soon as I said it, seems I got sweated
By some nigga with a TEC-9, trying to take mine
You wanna make noise, make noise
I make a phone call
My niggas coming like the Gotti boys
Bodies being found on Greenleaf
With their fucking heads cut off
Motherfucker, I'm Dre
So listen to the play-by-play, day-by-day
Rolling in my '4 with 16 switches
And got sounds for the bitches
Clocking all the riches
Got the hollow points for the snitches
So would you just walk on by
Cause I'm too hard to lift
And no, this ain't Aerosmith
It's the motherfucking D-R-E
From the C-P-T
On a rhyming spree, a straight G
Hop back as I pop my top, you trip
I let the hollow points commence to pop, pop, pop
Yeah, cause if it don't stop
I have to put my shit in reverse
Go back and take another spot

[Pre-Hook 1: Snoop Dogg]
Cause I'm rolling in my 6-4
(With all the niggas, sayin')

[Hook 1: Jewell (Dr. Dre)]
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
(Hell yeah)
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
(With all the niggas saying)
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
(Hell yeah)
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride

[Verse 2]
Just another motherfucking day for Dre, so I begin like this
No medallions, dreadlocks or black fists
It's just that gangsta glare
With gangsta raps
That gangsta shit
Makes a gangs of snaps
(Uh, word to the motherfucking streets)
And word to these hyped ass lyrics and dope beats
That I hit you with
That I get you with
As I groove in my '4 on D's
Hitting the switches
Bitches relax, while I get my proper swerve on
Bumping like a motherfucker ready to get my serve on
But before I hit the dope spot
Gotta get the chronic
The Remy Martin and my soda pop
Now I'm smelling like indo-nesia
Bus stop full of fly bitches and skeezers
On my dick cause my '4 on hit
Pancake, front and back, side to side, and all that shit
So when I crawl, I comes correct
Now, if your bitch in my shit, it's your bitch you check, nigga
Now let the Chevrolet slide
As I dip, a nigga trip to the south side
Yeah


[Pre-Hook 2: Snoop Dogg (Dr. Dre)]
Rolling in my 6-4

Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride

Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride

Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
(Know what I'm saying?)
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride

[Verse 3]
Check this out
The sun went down when I hit Slauson
On my way to the strip
Now I'm just flossin'
Checking my rearview
Cause niggas, they will do
Jack moves, black fools cause I smack fools
Try to set me up for a 2-11
Fuck around and get caught up in a (1-8-7)
But I don't represent no gangbang
Some niggas like lynching
But I just watch 'em hang
So on and so on
Why don't you let me roll on?
I remember back in the days when I used to have to get my stroll on
Didn't nobody wanna speak
Now everybody peeping out they window
When they hear me beating up the street
("Is it Dre? Is it Dre?")
That's what they say
Every single motherfucking day
Yo, but I ain't tripping, I'm just kicking it
While my D's keep spinning and these hoes keep grinning I be

[Pre-Hook 3: Snoop Dogg (Dr. Dre)]
Rolling in my 6-4

This should be played at high volume
Preferably in a residential area

[Verse 1 - The Lady of Rage]
Now I'mma kick up -- dust, as I begin to bust
On the wick-wack, fucked up suckers ya can't trust
When I kick up, I lick up, your face get smacked up
When I rack up, so all you motherfuckers just pack up
Or get slapped with the swiftness
If you think you're swift with the gift Merry Christmas
Now stuff that in your stockin'
I'm knockin' em out the box 'n'
Knocking em out their socks 'n', cause Robin is rockin'
Breaking em down to the -- slab
Taking em down on their -- ass
Now what you wanna do, ya wanna battle, uh?
Send you up shit creek without a motherfucking paddle
Rattle -- that brain, I'm not that same ol' plain Jane
Roll on you like a boulder, you're nothin' more than a grain
Or a pebble, take it from the real rap rebel
Not Bushwick Bill but I can take it to 'That Other Level'
You think you got pull? Then pull it, uh!
I got the trigger so I figure you'll bite the bullet
Then bite the dust and wipe the fuss
Do what I must, and what I must - is bust
The bubble, or two some trouble, for you
So skip to my Luger, Lady of Rage is comin' through

{*cut n scratch* "Some cool shit" 2X*}
{*"Boo-yaa! Spittin' out buckshots" -> B-Real*}

[Verse 2 - Kurupt]
I fears no one, I makes 'em cool off like a polar cat
Lynching, as a hit, misses the roll of dice
Pushing packs to make a profit
Diggy dope duck on the topic so stop and gimme my props, kid
I'm livin' large like a fat bitch
So get back, bitch, I'm hard to bogart, for the faggots
This young black kid, a mercenary, merciless
Murderin' millions of niggas so who's first to diss
They say I'm bad so you'll find none worse than this
Chewing motherfuckers up like a Hershey Kiss
Put to sleep, loving the lyrics I leave in the minds of each
Rough when flex, too complex, wrecks your mental piece
So feel the wrath, nigga, I rip in half niggas
You're quick to talk shit, I whoop your ass nigga
Then watch me blast, nigga, cause I'm the last nigga
You wanna fuck wit, so up your cash, nigga
I make em stagger, I'm scandalous as Jimmy Swaggart
I'm a good tracker, scoping your girl then watch me tag her
Pulling steel like a stunt
Shown like an ID card, nigga, no needs to front, so
Here to torment I put track on crack
And I'm strapped with a semi-tone mili-ten Mac
Yo, I breaks em off, I breaks em off, chief
Deadly as Jason on Friday the 13th

{"A to the motherfuckin' K"}

[Verse 3 - RBX]
Back in the days, niggas they use to scrap
But now in ninety-two, niggas they pull their strap
Cause umm, police them come wicked and them shoot
Niggas, so niggas retaliate and start to loot, execute.
Boot-stomping
Black soldier, here to teach and mold ya
The innovator, dominater, narra-rator
R-B to the motherfuckin' X -- flex wicked
Styley Lee, bump and be found and do bleed by a
Maniac, with a gat
See nowadays niggas is like that
I pull my trigger back, the bullets go
BO! BO! BO! Now I'm on Death Row
Fuck it, niggas going wild
Every night they shoot, it's like Beirut
Maybe you should get a Kevlar vest for your chest
Anytime steppin' through my hood
But that'll do you no good
One slug to your face, don't hate
You're gettin' smoked like wood
Nasty nigga bloody pumps face flat
On the concrete, here comes the white sheet
Mr. Coroner, caught with some yellow tape
But, the murderers escape
Audi like 5 G's
Lyrical gangbang but it's just a G thang[Verse One : Kurupt]
Brand new airmax is the start, Gucci and Louie from my belt to clothes
I change with the times moving up
I still canâ€™t find no one to trust
Nicky on tv with madona, sending out a message to you premadonas
And everybody that thought Nicki was whack, is eating those words watching Nicki stack
Roaming through the neighborhood feeling grand
This week I smoked about a million grams
Everything is new, life is too, I just bought a new house, what about you?
Just got a new whip, what about you
Just took a new trip to Istanbul
I solve equations difficult as Rubicâ€™s cube
Just keep your eyes open for the evening news
This ainâ€™t dr. dre nigga, just X cube

This my life, this oneâ€™s mine
This one time, Iâ€™ma do it for the

No more indo gin and juice, patron ciroc ace and goose
Kush on the plate a little yay to boose
Everyday L.A. ways loose, living like a millionaire driving them crazy
Billionaire mind set, I learned it brom baby
Gotta use the mind, frame the rider â€¦
Model bitches have the powder ratchet as fuck
Got the model bitches itching to get ratchet as fuck
Classic, passing passes, asking to fuck
Flowing â€¦ when I have my epiphany, a half full â€¦
Walking on chinchilla rugs, villa in Greece
Mic with assets, 100 tickets at least, my nigga

This my life, this oneâ€™s mine
This one time, Iâ€™ma do it for the Bentleys, bmwâ€™s, maybachs, rovers
Donâ€™t stand behind I may back over you
Classic banger, classic Bach, Beethoven
Rock James Hover, pac, game over
Wizardry in this industry, my century hold by the days that confuse
I break the industry rules like fuck it
This my time, for my life
This one I do it for the love of money
Money, a small piece of paper
Do it for the love of music
Music, music to get the money
Do it for the love of bitches
And bitches want the money
Iâ€™ma do it for me
And thatâ€™s what weâ€™re fighting for, the money
Fuck money! Oh, music! Bitches
Iâ€™ma do it for me, baby, baby, yeah, yeah
Money, oh, bitches, music
Fuck baby, baby, yeah

And there you have it, so down on the block
What would you do to get your money
And does it matter, money, music and bitches
Cycle is vicious, hahahaha, a hahahaha
But itâ€™s all done for the small piece of paper
That â€¦wait, and hate, as an almighty dollar, money
Fuck money! Oh, music! Bitches
Baby, baby, yeah, yeah{*bleeding over from last song: "jagged like a SkillSaw saw blade.."*}

Our time is nowwwwww ("Oh yeah!")

Death Valley, Cali baby

[Verse One: RBX]
My tactics extract morbid thoughts from the mental
Custom designed for the instrumental
Yes indeed-d-dy, lyrical graffiti
And this one's a burner, baby
Truck like Toyota
Driven, to a livin, drivin, with the gat
Uhh! Pop the clutch and let the cold crush rush
Then I flush wack material
That's if I don't mash the marks to mush
Now hush, let me brush, damn I gush
Cock, d-d-diesel cuts
Lyrical arsenal equivalent to arsenic
Now shut up punks, I want +Silence+ from you +Lambs+
Then I slams you with +Cape Fear+
I dump hardrocks like dump trucks that I deliver
Death right to your doorsteps
Loc' up yoke get broke up like the chronic
Twisted, rolled up, and SMOKED

[Hook]
We live in Long Beach baby
[RBX] Anybody killa? MASS MURDER
Death Valley, Cali baby

[Verse Two: RBX]
I fly off in your party like stealth bomber, troop
Eject before the wreck, crash boom bash!
Can you say, US Air, flight 427
Am I a quitter, nigga?
No survivors, not none, not one
Only thing livin is the maggots and the flies
Then I cause casualties, casually, annually
The manual be I flip scripts to A-U-T-O-matic
Think about the words of those who want static
Leave 'em lyin limp in clean free sheets
Long Beach, coroner, cling free sheets
Cling free beats, so why you still clingin?
It's the beats, and this time with the rhyme
I'mma kick the style like Na-di-a, ComÄƒneci
Round off has me do a triple somersault
Fools be comin up short - hazardous!
Bend, I send, havin this

[Hook] - repeat 2X

Stay back, lay back, way back in the cut

And it don't stop
Tell me where ya wanna go
To the strip
Or take a trip bawlin' with the row
My shit off in ya system attacks
Endo smoke in ya lungs, like that
You get lifted, calm, and if it's da bomb
Taken away like Calgon on Vietnam
California, back and on a mission, makin' a point
Ain't no fuckin' competition
They wishin' but run up on reality
CPT, CAL my locality
It's strange how I re-arrange and change the business
By droppin' shit like this
Dope, niggas can't cope with the real
I peal, penitentiaries still, when I kill it goes...

[Hook]

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Straight up. Now you niggas know where my homie comin' from

Stop ya', right in your tracks
If you dig 'em, you dug 'em and dig 'em good for a smack (?)
Back to the hood nigga
Where my homies on the corner throwing it up and don't give a fuck
About a cracker jacker with a bag of white
Motherfuckers (?) now I'mma smack 'em
With the grip of that gansta shit
That be humpin' and bumpin' Compton
The city I'm from, you can't get none
Try to step up and you'll get done (?) done
One fool tried to get with me

Remember me? Seven executions
Remember me? I have no remorse
Remember me? I'm high powered
Remember me? I drop bombs like Hiroshima

[Verse 1: RBX]
For this one it's the X; you retarded?!
Cause I grab the mic and get Down like syndrome
Hide and roam into the masses
Without boundaries, which qualifies me
For the term universal, without no rehearsal
I leak words that's controversial
Like I'm not the one you wanna contest, see
Cause I'll hit your ass like the train did that bitch
That got banned from TV, heavyweight hitter
Hit you watch your whole head split up
Loco is the motion, we comin' through
Hollow tips is the lead, the forty-five threw

[Hook: Sticky Fingaz]
Remember me? Throw ya gunz in the air
Remember me? Slam, Slam
Remember me? Nigga, bacdafucup
Remember me? Chka-chka-Onyx

[Verse 2: Sticky Fingaz]
Niggas that take no for an answer, get told "no"
Yeah, I been told no, but it was more like "no, no, no"
Life's a bitch, met her, fuck you if you let her
Better come better than better to be a competitor
This vet is ahead of the shit is all redder, you deader and deader
A medic instead of the cheddars and credda
Settle vendetta with metal beretta from ghetto to ghetto
Evidence, nope, never leave a shred-of
I got the soul of every rapper in me, love me or hate me
My mom's got raped by the industry and made me
I'm the illest nigga ever, I told you
I get more pussy than them dyke bitches Total
Want beef, nigga? Pbbt, you better dead that shit
My name should be Can't-Believe-That-Nigga-Said-That-Shit
Probably sayin' he ain't a killer, but I'm killin' myself
Smoke death, fuck bitches raw, on the kitchen floor
So think what I'mma do to you, have done to you
Got niggas in my hood who'd do that shit for a blunt or two
What you wanna do? cocksuckers, we Glock busters
'til the cops cuff us, we'll start ruckus and drop blockbusters
Round the clock hustlers, you cannot touch us
I'm getting wires niggas wanting me dead, wanting my head
You think it could be something I said ?

[Hook: Eminem]
Remember me? I just don't give a fuck
Remember me? Yeah, fuck you too
Remember me? I'm low down and I'm shifty
Remember me? I'm Shady

[Verse 3: Eminem]
When I go out, I'mma go out shooting
I don't mean when I die, I mean when I go out to the club, stupid
I'm tryna clean up my fuckin' image so I promised the fuckin' critics
I wouldn't say fuckin' for six minutes (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)
My baby's mom, bitch made me an angry blonde
So I made me a song, killed her and put Hailie on
I may be wrong, I keep thinking these crazy thoughts
In my cranium, but I'm stuck with a crazy mom
(Is she really on as much dope as you say she's on)
Came home, and somebody musta broke in the back window
And stole two loaded machine guns and both of my trenchcoats
Sick, sick dreams of picnic scenes
Two kids, sixteen with M-16's and ten clips each
And them shits reach through six kids each
And Slim gets blamed in Bill Clint's speech to fix these streets?
Fuck that, pbbt â€“ you faggots can vanish to volcanic ash
And reappear in hell with a can of gas and a match
Aftermath, Dre, grab the gat, show 'em where it's at
(What the fuck you staring at, nigga?)

[Outro]
Don't you remember me? Remember me?
Remember me? Remember me? (Slim Shady!)[Intro]
Six million ways to die, choose one

[Kurupt]
It's time to escape, but I don't know where the fuck I'm headed
Up or down, right or left, life or death
I see myself in a mist of smoke
Death becomes any nigga that takes me for a joke
We hit a five dollar stick, now we puttin in work
Unaccountable amounts of dirt, death becomes all niggas
Anybody killa, you know what the deal is
Nigga, you know what the real is

[Daz]
I see some mark brand niggas on the corner flaggin me down
Sayin, "Yo Daz, what's up with the Pound?
Is that nigga Snoop alright? Aiyyo what's up with the crew?
Is them niggas in jail, or are them niggas through?"
I said, "If you ain't up on thangs
Snoop Dogg is the name, Dogg Pound's the game"
It's like this they don't understand
It's an everyday thang, to gangbang
Make that twist, don't be a bitch, let these niggas know
What's up witchu I represent the Pound and Death Row
And can't no other motherfucker in L.A. or Long Beach
And Compton and Watts see D-O-G's
Now, you can't come and you can't run, and you can't
See long to the G of the gang
One gun is all that we need, to put you to rest
{Pump pump!} Put two slugs dead in your chest
Now you dead then a motherfucker creepin and sleepin
6 feet deep in, fuckin with the Pound is

[Bridge]
Suicide, it's a suicide
(Repeat x4)

[Snoop]
The cloud becomes black, and the sky becomes blue
Now you in the midst of the Dogg Pound crew
Ain't no clue, on why the fuck we do what we do
Leave you in a state of paranoia, oooh
Don't make a move for your gat so soon cuz
I drops bombs like Platoon (ay nigga)
Walk with me, hold my hand and let me lead you
I'll take you on a journey, and I promise I won't leave you
(I won't leave you) until you get the full comprehension
And when you do, that's when the mission
Or survival, becomes your every thought
Keep your eyes open, cuz you don't wanna be caught
Half steppin with your weapon on safety
Now break yourself motherfucker, 'fore you make me
Take this 211 to another level
I come up with your ends, you go down with the devil
Now roam through the depths of hell
Where the rest your busta ass homeboys dwell
Well

[Hook]
Suicide, it's a suicide
(Repeat x3)
Now tell me, what's my motherfuckin name?
Serial killa! Serial killa! Serial killa!
(Wake up in the morning eat your Lucky Charms cereal)

[RBX]
Deep, deep like the mind of Minolta, now picture this
Let's picnic inside a morgue
Not pic-a-nic baskets, pic-a-nic caskets
And I got the machine, that cracks your fuckin chest plates
Open and release them guts
Then I release def cuts
Brutal, jagged edged, totally ruffneck
Now everybody scream nuff respect to the X
Nuff respect given
Disrespect and you will not be livin
Word to momma, Emma, drama, dilemma

[Hook]"All units, code four."
"Suspect's wearing a black leather jacket
Black boots, carrying a numchuk (with a possible gun)."

[RBX]
BOOOM nigga! Right back at ya
What the fuck you thought, nigga?
Come to Long Beach and get yo' motherfuckin ass caught
Put in the crosshair, and that's for real nigga
And that's how we do shit nigga
You better, ask some-motherfuckin-body

[Hook]
Slip into some fucked up shit with me
As night prepares yo' mind to sleep
Slip into some fucked up shit with me
You in a chronic haze and fall asleep
Slip into some fucked up shit with me
And when you wake up you don't know where you at
Slip into some fucked up shit with me
Uh-huh.. this is Long Beach (MUR-DER)

[RBX]
Now let's get down to the nitty gritty
Mood is shitty, no pity
Long Beach is the city
Since I'm from Long Beach, I got to put in work
And no, this ain't Compton and Long Beach together;
Strictly Long Beach
Listen to me preach
Anybody killa?! Mass murder! {*boom boom*}
That was the sound of my double barreled shotgun
And there is no place to run
So if you're thinkin bout comin to Long Beach
Chip in, bullets will be zippin
Zappin - bodies collapsin
Killa beats! Then I put the raps in
It's on it's on it's on and
We can bust a cap 'til the break of dawn
So now that you heard the warning
I welcome you - with open arms
Open FIRE arms {*BLAM BLAM*}
And we don't give a fuck about cars with alarms
It's a jack move nigga give it up is you crazy?
Glock 40 pointed to your head

Record companies that made them, niggas and bitches they hate them
It's all about the gimick
Tryin' to mimic original niggas that be on the nuts with no limits
You're gettin' circled like my niggas makin Haj in Mecca
The black stones substitute us through the microphone
Every year you got a new patch of clones
Thinkin' they're the shit, roamin' around like Shrones
Predictable niggas, I've seen them comin' like the breeze
Making the killing for these bitch companies
Ugh, shove your ass overseas, house arrestin'
Put your shit on hold, just to teach you the worst lesson
And tell your mamma quit pagin' a nigga while I work
And leave this niggas shit to the motherfuckin' experts

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Hold on Dogg, what now huh? - how you feel?
Yeah, shit's gettin' bad before your boy got steel
Not gettin' kneel, watch yourself cause it's ill
Home boys kill home boys and that's real
The hardest niggas who tell ya
When you're in jail, you're a motherfuckin' failure
With no one to bail you, they'll sell you every bang
Except the game, to stay on the top of the game
Remember the home boy with the flossy rings
Where he at? - just homies took him up out the game
It's a cold game
But you got to know, when you're ended, it's a cold shame
If you're gettin' barred, you got to stay stand
And do what you got to do, to get in
Every since, I put my hands in this dirty rap game
Look here, I've been on this mission tryin' get the scratch, man

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]

[Verse 3: RBX]
Now, what you need with that six hundred?
Flipped up your plain tendered, like itchy pain thundered
What fool? - let that bullshit settle
Go against your hard block, black talent fatal
Peep, I flop rhyme to the beat
And flip more til explode when it's time compete
Blow up, throw up your hands to this
It's easy to be Ruthless gangsters never die
Chanters never try, pranksters only fry
Now, walk the plane, got bet they can't fly
Vision this, like David Tow
Full repertoire as fast as mega Death Row
Fool, you're about to call, murder so bizarre
Are you ready?

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]

[Outro: MC Ren Talking]
So whatcha want? Whatcha want? Whatcha want?
Yeah, '98 stylin, it's the Villain up in this bitch
With my nigga Snoop Dogg, RBX, L.T
Doin' this shit like this, for all y'all bitch ass niggas
It's time for y'all niggas to step out the game
Let these real niggas keep this, and do it like this '98 stylin'
Ruthless Villain stylin, ugh[Intro: Bushwick Bill]
Yes, it is I says me
And all who agree are more than three, cause they we
Yes, yo, I'm in the house now for sure
Because I wanna talk about the hearts of men
Who knows what evil lurks within them?
But let's take a travel down the blindside
And see what we find on this path, called

[Verse 1: Kurupt]
Stranded on Death Row, so duck when I swing my shit
I get rugged like Rawhead Rex with fat tracks that fits
The gangsta type, what I recite's kinda lethal
Niggas know, the flow that I kick, there's no equal!
I'm murderin' niggas, yo, and maybe because of the tone I kicks
When I grip the mic and kick shit niggas can't fuck with
So remember I go hardcore, and slam
'Nough respect like a sensei, whoop ass like Van Damme
So any nigga that claim they bossin'
What don't you bring your ass on over to Crenshaw and Slauson
Take a walk through the hood, and we up to no good
Slangin' 'em things like a real O.G. should
I'm stackin' and mackin' and packin' a ten so
When you're slippin', I slip the clip in, but ain't no set-tripppin'
Cause it's Death Row, rollin' like the mafia
Think about whoopin' some ass, but what the fuck stoppin' ya
Ain't nothin' but a buster
I'm "Stranded on Death Row" for pumpin' slugs in motherfuckers
Now you know you're outdone, feel the shotgun
Kurupt inmate cell block one

[Verse 2: RBX]
No prevention from this lynchin' of sorts
You're a victim, from my driveby of thoughts
No extensions, all attempts are to fail
Blinded by the light, it's time you learn braille
From the lunatic, I'm death like arsenic
When I kick a wicked rap, Dr. Dre will hit the scratch
With treachery, my literary form will blast
And totally surpass the norm
Not a storm, plural, make it, many storms
When I'm vexed, I fly leg necks and arms
In this dimension, I'm the presenter
And the inventor, and the tormentor
Deranged, like the Hillside Strangler
Emcee mangler, tough like Wrangler
I write a rhyme, hard as concrete
Step to the heat and get burned like mesquite
So what you wanna do
The narrator RBX, cell block two

[Verse 3: The Lady of Rage]
Rage, lyrical murderer; "Stranded on Death Row"
And now I'm serving a - lifetime sentence
There'll be no repentance
Since it's the life that I choose to lead, I plead guilty
On all counts let the ball bounce where it may
It's just another clip into my AK
Buck them down with my underground tactics
Facts and stacks of clips on my mattress -
Bed frame there's another dead, bang
Laying lame put to shame, who's to blame
Me, the Lady of Rage, a woman comin'
From the D-E-A-T-H and R-O-W takin', no shit
So flip and you're bound to get dropped
It's 1-8-7 on motherfuckers, don't stop!
Handcuffed as I bust there'll be no debate
It's Rage, from Cell Block H

[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg]
Aiyyo steppin' through the fog and creepin' through the smog
It's the number one nigga from the hood Doggy Dogg
Making videos, now I stay in Hollywood
Bustin' raps for my snaps now they call me Eastwood
Dre is the doctor and my homey little nigga
Warren G is my hand and my hand's on the trigga
Shootin' at the hoes with the game that I got
Sent to Death Row cause I wanted to make a grip from serving my rocks
And I'm still, serving for mines, peace
To my motherfucking homies doin time
In the pen and the county jail
Mobbin with your blues on, mad as hell
And you sayin', "Fuck the Police!"
And all the homies on the streets is all about peace
And it's driving the cops crazy
But ain't nothin' but a black thing bay-bee, uhh
Uhh, I'm not flaggin', but I'm just saggin'
I betcha don't wanna see the D-O double G
And you can't see, the D-R to the E
Or my motherfuckin' homey D.O.C
You know you can't fuck with my motherfuckin DJ
That's my homey and we call him Warren G
Yeah, and you don't stop
Doggy Dogg break 'em down with the motherfuckin' Dogg Pound
That's the only way we'll beat 'em man
We gotta smoke 'em, then choke 'em like the motherfuckin Peterman!
It's like three and to the two and two and to the one
Cell block four peace Doggy Dogg's done

[Outro: Bushwick Bill]
Yo, now you know the path I'm on
You think you're strong, see if you can travel on
Cause only the weak, will try to speak
Those who are quiet, will always cause riots
There's three types of people in the world
Those who don't know what happened
Those who wonder what happened
And people like us from the streets that MAKE things happen
