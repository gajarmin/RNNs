[Verse]
I know I dream about her all day
I think about her with her clothes off
I'm ridin' 'round with my system bumpin' LSD
I look for ways to say "I love you"
But I ain't into makin' love songs
Baby, I'm just rappin' to this LSD
She ain't a stranger to the city life
I introduced her to this hippy life
We make love under pretty lights, LSD (Acid)
I get a feelin' it's a trippy night
Them other drugs just don't fit me right
Girl, I really fuckin' want love, sex, dream
Another quarter to the face system
Make no mistakes, it's all, a leap of faith for love
It takes a place in, feelin' that you crave doin' love, sex, dreams

[Chorus]
It started in Hollywood
Dreamin' of sharin' love
My tongue at a loss for words
Cause my feelings just said it all
Party just started up
Dreamin' of sharin' worlds
Held this feeling for way too long
Said, "I really wanna let it go"

[Bridge 1]
I've been gettin' fly because the gimmick's so dope
I've been getting high cause I figured Lord told me
I've been drinking, driving, now we'll never go home
I gon' stay in doubt because the weather's so cold, oh

[Bridge 2]
Feeling low sometimes when the light shines down
Makes me high
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Feeling low sometimes when the light shines down
Makes me high
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

[Chorus]
It started in Hollywood
Duh, duh-duh
Dreamin' of sharin' love
Duh, duh-duh
My tongue at a loss for words
Cause my feelings just said it all

[Outro]
I look for ways to say, "I love you"
But I ain't into makin' love songs
Baby I'm just rappin' to this LSD[Produced by Hector Delgado, A$AP Rocky, Vulkan the Krusader, Jim Jonsin, Finatik N Zac]

[Intro]
For all them hoes that was frontin' on niggas back in the days, man
(This for my broke jiggy niggas)
You know what I'm saying?
Excuse me, fuck out my face
They say wealth is in the mind, not the pocket
I learned that from a very wise man

Gotta pocket full of stones like Pimp say

[Verse 1]
Okay excuse me, Mr. Bill Collector, I got problems
My check arrive mañana, I'ma pay my debt, I promise
I spent 20 thousand dollars with my partners in Bahamas
Another 20 thousand dollars on Rick Owens out in Barneys
I said excuse me, why the fuck you lookin'? What's your problem?
I swear we gon' have drama if you touch my tailored garments
All you see is niggas here, so that means it's triggers there
What you mean? We got weed, and codeine and bricks for sale
I bet a lot of niggas plottin' so you know I got that heater, bruh
Drive my side of Harlem, catch me ridin' with my nina, bruh
She got an apple bottom that remind you of Bonita, bruh
Oh you mean like Q-Tip? Now that girl my new bitch
Excuse me, no, I believe the proper term's excuse you
I could switch up on you niggas and start shittin' if I choose to
That's when the new you becomin' different since they knew you
I guess the new me is just gon' take some gettin' used to

[Hook]
Excuse me, I tell them they're excused
What's the word around town, tell me what's the latest news
And uh, who them niggas, I tell 'em we them dudes
Ain't got time to make excuses bruh we steady making moves
And I, run the game even when they bend the rules
I pay very close attention after that I pay my dues
And uh, excuse me, may I be excused?
Cause I gave this shit my all, ain't got nothing left to lose

[Verse 2]
Tell me why these little niggas talking like they killas, bruh
Nowadays these niggas always caught up in they feelings, bruh
But I stay 100 cause you know I keep it trilla, bruh
Mobbin like 2Pacalypse or Bishop how I Hit 'Em Up
Fill 'em up with lyrics, bury all my victims, kill 'em
Dig 'em up again, to say I did it
Snitch, excuse me, mind your business, bruh
Swear that you could get it, girl
She a fashion killa, huh? Killa girl, I'm a go-getter, she get it, girl
Flacko, where you been? I've been thuggin' with my niggas, bruh
Flacko, how you been? I'm still thuggin' with my niggas, bruh
Flacko, where you been? I've been thuggin' with my niggas, bruh
Flacko, how you been? I've been thuggin' with my...
Buggin' with my niggas, go sluggin'
Tell me who fuckin' with my niggas
Who run it, my niggas, fuck the fussin', they buckin' and bussin'
Now niggas slump over Robitussin in public
Cup full of purple substance or something
My niggas, the only thing that move me:
'Excuse me'

[Hook]
Excuse me, I tell them they're excused
What's the word around town, tell me what's the latest news
And uh, who them niggas, I tell 'em we them dudes
Ain't got time to make excuses bruh we steady making moves
And I, run the game even when they bend the rules
I pay very close attention after that I pay my dues
And uh, excuse me, may I be excused?
Cause I gave this shit my all, ain't got nothing left to lose

[Outro]
Flacko (x12)[Verse 1]
We touch, I feel a rush, we clutch, it isn’t much
But it’s enough to make me wonder what’s in store for us, it’s lust
It’s torturous, you must be a sorceress cause' you just
Did the impossible: gained my trust, don’t play games it’ll be dangerous
If you fuck me over, cause if I get burnt, I'mma show you
What it’s like to hurt cause I been treated like dirt before ya
And love is evil, spell it backwards I’ll show ya
Nobody knows me, I’m cold, walk down this road all alone
It’s no one’s fault but my own, it’s the path I’ve chosen to go
Frozen as snow, I show no emotion whatsoever so
Don’t ask me why I have no love for these muh'fuckin' hoes
Blood suckin’ succubuses, what the fuck is up with this?
I’ve tried in this department, but I ain’t had no luck with this
It sucks, but it’s exactly what I thought it would be like tryna start over
I got a hole in my heart, but some kinda emotional roller coaster
Something I won’t go on so you toy with my emotions, so it’s over
It’s like an explosion everytime I hold ya, I wasn’t joking when I told ya
You take my breath away, you’re a supernova, and I'm a...

[Hook]
I’m a space bound rocketship and your hearts the moon
And I’m aiming right at you, right at you
Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I’m aiming right at you, right at you, right at you

[Verse 2]
I’ll do whatever it takes, when I’m with you I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain’t with you, I have zero strength
There’s no limit on how far I would go, no boundaries, no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we thinks
Gonna be that one, then once we get them it’s never the same
You want them when they don’t want you, soon as they do feelings change
It’s not a contest and I ain’t on no conquest for no mate
I wasn’t looking when I stumbled on to you, musta been fate
But so much is at stake, what the fuck does it take? Let’s cut to the chase
'fore the door shuts in your face, promise me if I cave in and break
And leave myself open that I won’t be making a mistake, cause I'm a

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
So after a year and six months, it’s no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts, never mistreated you once
I poured my heart out to you, let down my guard, swear to God
I blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms
Drop to my knees and I’m pleading, I’m tryna stop you from leaving
You won’t even listen so fuck it, I’m tryna stop you from breathing
I put both hands on your throat, I sit on top of you squeezing
'til I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick, ain’t no possible reason
I can think of to let you walk up out this house and let you live
Tears stream down both of my cheeks now I let you go and just give
And 'fore I put that gun to my temple I told you this

[Bridge]
And I would've did anything for you, to show you how much I adored you
But it’s over now, it’s too late to save our love
Just promise me you’ll think of me every time
You look up in the sky and see a star cause I'm a

[Outro]
I’m a space bound rocketship and your hearts the moon
And I’m aiming right at you, right at you
Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I’m so lost without you, without you, without you[Verse 1]
I thought I'd probably die in prison, expensive taste in women
Ain't had no pot to piss in, now my kitchen full of dishes
Nose bloody from that sniffin', your heroin addiction
Trigger finger itching fuck parental supervision
This be that murder business, little Timmy got that semi
I ain't kidding hide yo kittens, hit yo children with that Smith and
A bunch of ignant little niglets, hard headed, never listen
Purple sippin', finger twistin', teeth glisten like it's Memphis
A bunch of hypocritic[al] Christians, the land of no religion
My Santa Claus was missing, catch you slippin' then it's Christmas
Motherfuck a wishlist, my ghetto was ambition
For my benjis and my Bentley, and them bitches now I gets gets
On the road to riches, a diamond ring, designer jeans
Choking on that biscuit till I'm no longer existing
I wonder if they miss me, as long as I make history
Now my soul is feeling empty, tell the reaper come and get me

[Hook]
Who said you can’t live forever lied
Of course, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll live long
You can’t ever deny
My force, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll LIVE

[Verse 2]
Riding through your city like that motherfucka mine
Or choking on that semi, rob a motherfucka blind
License plate says wipe me down, car from 1989
But a nigga sits so pretty call that motherfucker fine
Lost your motherfucking mind, what's on your mind niggas talking down
Never talk to cops, make him talk to God when I tote that 9, he ain't talking now
Tell 'em watch your spine, I mean watch your back
Better guide your track, better not look back
Now stay in line, don't step on cracks
So you break her back I'm talking 'bout your mom
Cause there's killers in my town, making hits, sniffing lines
Out committing crimes, wait for shit to simmer down
Corrupted little minds, 8 and 9, finna shine
On the grind, do you dirty with that shimmy shimmy ya
Where they shoot without a purpose, services 'n hearses
Kids who ain't deserve it, can't survive a thing, you're worthless
Strangers make me nervous, who's that peekin' in my window with a pistol to my curtains?

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Pretty nigga rich, Flacko be the shit
And that bitch, know we poppin' so she boppin' on this dick
Nigga, R.I.P. to Pimp, can't forget Little Flip
And I take it out to Memphis so shout out to Triple Six

[Hook][Verse 1 - Kid Cudi]
She said I don't spend time like I really should
She said she don't know me
Anymore
I think she hates me deep down, I know she does
She wants to erase me
A couple days, no talking, I see my baby
And this what she tells me

[Hook]
She said: I keep on running, keep on running, and nothing works
I can't get away from you, no
I keep on ducking, keep on ducking you, nothing helps
I can't stop missing you

[Verse 2 - Kid Cudi]
It's like I'm her new nightmare, she ain't escaping
It makes me feel a bit complete
Knowing someone you love don't feel the same way about ya
Memories they soon delete
A couple weeks, no talking, I see my baby
I missed you so damn much
Hey, I wish we could start over, I told my baby
This what this bitch tells me

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Yeah, cause I'm in the magazines, on the TV
No matter where you are, you might hear me
I'm in the magazines, on the TV
No matter where you go, you might see me

[Verse 3 - Kanye West]
I'm Yeezy, she say "Hi, I'm Aria"
No, you a angel, you wave "Hi" to Aaliyah
I got a show in Korea, they built a new arena
Why don't you come and watch a nigga tear the whole scene up
I know I seen you before, but don't know where I seen ya
Oh I remember now, it's something that I dreamed of
Don C says she cool, but don't let her fuck your cream up
Monica Lewinsky on the dress, you take her to the cleaners
Sure enough, a week later, I'm in extra love
And everybody know she's mine so she extra plugged
Every bouncer, every club show her extra love
We just praying the new fame don't get the best of us
But all good things gotta come to a en-a
She let it go to her head, "No, not my Aria"
The height of her shopping was writer's blocking me
I couldn't get my shit out anyway, I hope you die Aria![Verse 1]
Say baby, I'mma wait up for you
I'mma have my way with your body
And when I’m done touching you
I bet you won’t wanna
Give yourself to nobody
Baby when the lights go out
It’s like we’re the only ones
And I already feel it now
It’s like you’re the only one
Only one who knows just how
How to make the time stand still
We’re caught in the moment

[Hook]
So don’t let me down
You made those promises
Don’t take em back now
Don’t let me down
Do all the things you said that had me going
Let’s get caught in the moment
Let’s get caught in the moment

[Verse 2]
Smoking one and rolling one
I come and break you down for fun
You love it when I get up in it
Kiss your body when I’m finished
My drop crotch is by Knomadik
My drop top is automatic
Put you in it, now you tweaking
I kidnap you for the weekend
Rolling up and going up
I’m smoking weed and pouring up
I take that money, hold it up
I take your legs and fold em up
I take my time, I break it down
I tell you not to make a sound
I take that KK, pass it round
Your clothes keep dropping to the ground

[Hook]
So don’t let me down
You made those promises
Don’t take em back now
Don’t let me down
Do all the things you said that had me going
Let’s get caught in the moment
Let’s get caught in the moment[Intro: Lil Wayne]
No homo
I say he's so sweet, make her wanna lick the wrapper

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Lollipop, lollipop
Breasts is just like Dolly Parton
She ride my spaceship 'til she hit the top
That hit the spot, 'til she ask
"How many li-i-li-i-licks do it take 'til she get to shop?"
Don't worry why my wrists got so freeze?
Tell her, "Girl, like Doritos, that's nacho cheese"
Tell her friends, "Like Fritos, I'm trying to lay"
I can't only have one and I ain't tryin to wait"
This a song with Wayne, so you know it's gonna melt
But you ain't finna murder me like everybody else
I'mma rap like I got some type of respect for myself
I don't do it for my health, man I do it for the belt
Man, I do it to the death, 'til the roof get melt
Hundred degrees, drop the roof, so the coupe don't melt
Man, the flow so cold chicken soup won't help
We need fo' mo' hoes, we need oh-oh-oh-oh!
You know what it is when we're outta town
We ball in 2 seats, and you out of bounds
So come here baby girl
You're now fuckin' with the best in the world
Lollipop
The best in the wo-rld

[Hook: Static Major]
She lick me like a lollipop
Shawty want a thug
Bottles in the club
Shawty wanna hump, you know I like to touch your lovely lady lumps

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Shawty say she wanna lick the wrapper
And she gonna lick the rapper
And I just wanna act like a porno-flicking actor
I Anita Bake-her, now she caught up in that Rapture
I got so much chips, I swear they call me Hewlett Packard
I got so much chips you can have a bag if you're a snacker
Greedy mutha-fudge cake, now tell me how that fudge tastes
I do it for bloods' sake, soo-woo think it's voodoo
How that roof do di-di-dissipate, your girl wants to participate
She so so sophisticate, cause her brain is off the chain
And then my diamonds are in the choir, because they sang from off my chain
And my Nina just joined the gang, because, all she do is bang!
Like Ricky Martin; Wayne and Kanye: pick your poison
If that woman wanna cut, then tell her I am Mr. Ointment
Tell her to make an appointment with Mr. I-Can't-Make-An-Appointment
Take my lollipop and enjoy it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Why would she? She probably be the odd cookie
In the plastic bag 'bout to get crushed by a building
I flushed out the feeling of me being the shit
Cause I was leaving skid marks on everywhere I sit
I am everywhere, I'm it like, Hide-n-Go
And I can go anywhere: innie, minnie, miney, mo
I'm in your neighborhood, area, CD thing, tape deck
IPod, your girlfriend - and she say I got great sex
Safe sex is great sex, better wear a latex
Cause you don't want that late text, that "I think I'm late" text
So wrap it up!
But he's so sweet she wanna lick the wrapperAy Caribe el tierra del mi gente hermosa
(Armada Latina)
Cielo y Sol, me acompanan donde quiera
(mi fama hispana)
Hermanito la lucha recien que impieza
(hermano ponle gana)
Yo naci con sangre Taina, yo naci

[Verse 1: B-Real]
Came out the other man
Southern land
Didn't have an upper hand
Never had another plan
I'm different to them other men
Some will get a summer tan
It's hotter than a summer jam
Live for today
Cause you're never getting another chance
I ain't tripping off the he say and she say
Cause we say fuck
And pass me a cuba libre
That's what we want
Don't front
I could see ya but
You don't want to see the cold heap up front
How we blow it up
We came to blow it up, hit the spot
So we're done
Representin' in, blowin up
That's how we show the love
That's how we pass up all this shit that
We know gon' come
It's like the soldier's run is done when the war's won

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Latino hasta la muerte
Chico stay working hard
Bout the noise
Suerte Gracias a Dios, Thank God
The Cubans from Miami coulda took that coke route
Marimberos balseros con clinicas
Santeros con muela
Que dicen que pueden curar abuelas
Ya'll like Scarface
I'm more like Sosa
Cypress hill pretty flaco
It's our culture
From Cali to the crib, crib
Me in miami
Thank god I'm doin music
If not I'd be tying families
I'm not a asshole(oh no)
About my cash flow
Let me take this shit
And send this letter off to Castro
Ha, ha, ha Dale, come mierda

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sen Dog]
We way too hot
Always coming up with something clever
La cosa nostra
Cypress Hill maca fera
Feeling fancy in the hip throne, guayabera
And we just clowning
On what we call some, money-lera
Call me Senny
Wild child from the isles
I can go forever like an old fashioned country mile
Stilo be guajiro
Latino is the lingo
I'm straight cubanichi
I bang Pinar del Rio
Lockin up this function
Just like Benny More
Go ahead and play the congas
And I'm gonna rap over it
Ya I'm a fool I'm outta here
Yes sir I gotta go
Get me some Chivas Regal
And slap me some dominos[Hook: Andre Merrit]
Been holding this pain inside for so long
Though the rain never goes away
They say I should leave these streets behind me
But it's so hard to escape
Oh Lord please send me an angel
To lead me out of this place
Take me away, away
Far away, to better days

[Verse 1: The Game]
First thing I wanna do is say "What up" to T.I
King of the south, now everybody see why
I'm just driving and thinking how I survived here
And I ain't seen Dre and Eminem in five years
That sound Shady right, I live a crazy life
So many black thoughts I had to paint the Mercedes white
I could tell you 'bout the rims, but I ain't here for that
Going out like Big and Pac, I fear for that
Take this Lambo, and put six holes in it
Shut up the glass and leave my body exposed in it
Lift the doors up and let all of my demons out
And I can see my brother now cause that's what I've been dreamin 'bout
I ain't thinkin 'bout bitches or pulling Beamers out
I'm thinkin 'bout my sons' safety everytime they leave the house
I know how to make it out the hood, I seen the route
And here's the proof, me, Venus and Serena out

[Hook]

[Verse 2: The Game]
I'm sittin on these stairs at this church, 'bout to start a verse
And somewhere in the world, somebody 'bout to start a hearse
Tell me who inside it, Who's son is that
And how he get there, now tell me who gun was that
I ain't saying confess, definitely ain't saying snitch
But if you killed the nigga, help his mama dig his ditch
I'm from a hood where niggas gotta keep they gun cocked
And kids wear Dre Beats to stop the sound of gun shots
But at least they got the Dre Beats
Cause kids in Africa ain't even got shoes on they feet
And I seen it with my own eyes
At the same time I'm picking flies off my own eyes
Can you feel that, If you can hear 'em buzzin
You can feel the pain of Mike Tyson and his baby mother
They lost they baby daughter, and she was only three
She never got a chance to blossom on the family tree

[Hook]

Verse 3: The Game]

We got a new president and I love that he black
But I'mma ask him like Bush "Where the soldiers at?"
Now move the camera to New Orleans "Where the soldiers at?"
The water dried up, well nigga do the Nolia clap
We all juveniles, we all been through some trials
And some tribulations, I'm in this booth pacin'
What do I say next, should I talk about some cars?
Or the next chapter of my life and show you all my scars
All my bullet wounds and my stab wounds
I can't show you, I covered 'em up with tattoos
I can't do nothing but spit the truth
On probation, smoke and drink Patron before I hit the booth
You makin' songs for the club, when niggas drinking
I make 'em for the ride home, when niggas thinking
One minute you here, next minute shit is tragic
And this a Jim Jonsin track, now feel the static

[Hook]Troy NōKA:

My day intel's of making chips, bill gates
I'm try'na get my pockets fat, uncle phils face
Fresh prince i'm in bel-air
Burning trees with my nigga, frank
Lucas how i do this, what that mean?, that mean i'm getting bank

Trailer park's on fire, Billy been cookin' up somethin'
If you need a biscuit, come on then
Billy has got it jumpin' get it from a pro
Get it for the low, get you some blow
Get it for the nose, get it for the show
Get it for the hoes, four wheeler cranked up
Gas tank on the ATV
It's full of that crank but, Billy got pills from A to Z
So what do you think bud, Billy won't go below fifty
Twenty-two's are dangerous
Drink a finger with the nugget rings
Pow, take one from the needle, how you feelin' now
Purple moons and lucky charms, yeah that's the sound
Of veins turnin' brown, but his fame is so profound
His name is like a noun, they going Billy now

[Refrain]
Billy's on the corner with the Crystal Meth
And he ain't slowing down, slowin' down
Billy's on the corner with the Crystal Meth
Go Billy
C-c-c-c-Crystal Meth

[Verse 2]
Hello junkie and hello Momma too
Hello to my P.O, deuce up to the boys in blue
Billy got brass balls
Twenty pounds on the catwalk
LSD and Adderall
And LCD's on the wall
He's watchin' every move
High-tech Redneck
Run up on him if ya want to
I bet redneck, c'mon
It might be dark in the woods
But the lights are on
The money's counted
And if the price is wrong
Well then Billy will get them Gremlins like Spielberg
He'll take your house down, off of them pillars
And take your Mom to Sizzler
And feed her chicken liver
That's cold blooded love
Billy's a chiller

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
4:30 in the A.M
Billy ain't slept for days
Gotta keep up with the profit
Gotta keep up with the craze
It's a heavy shade
Gotta walk through the maze
Down where the sun don't shine
And the pine trees sway
And when the wind blew
And the cradle fell
Down come baby Billy
And up come an able male
Momma stayed at work
Daddy stayed in jail
Hey that's a full deck
But ya gotta play with what your dealt
So Billy dealt the joker
Put the sheriff in a choker
He drank himself sober
And pissed in a Super Soaker
And he wet 'em all up
And left his snow yellow
That's hard White Boy
For the L O

[Refrain][Produced by Jonsin, Rico Love, Romano, and Mr. Morris]

[Intro]
I know you think I'm afraid
To take a chance, and go to the deep end
Usher baby
Turn the lights on

[Verse 1]
These waters can get a little busy
But I got experience
Don't mind trekking to the storm
Long as I know that you're here with me baby
Shedding all your innocence
I see the walls are looking like they might precipitate
Until I'm in so deep, it's up to my waist
But I promise girl I ain't afraid

[Hook]
It's raining inside your bed
No parts are dry
Loving makes you so wet, your legs, your thighs
And ever since we first met I knew that
I, I knew I was ready baby to take that dive

[Verse 2]
Can't help it, no
I want you to feel me
Every little bit of me
I don't need a life saver
Baby going deeper ain't gon kill me
And I know the rush you get from me
I see the walls are looking like they might precipitate
Until I'm in so deep, it's up to my waist
But I promise girl I ain't afraid

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'll be inside when the tides are rolling baby
You'll be my place to hide, all night
I'm not afraid to try
And knew i, don't mind playing in the rain
And I was hoping that I get to take that dive

[Hook]
It's raining inside your bed[Verse 1 - Kid Cudi]
She said I don't spend time like I really should
She said she don't know me
Anymore
I think she hates me deep down, I know she does
She wants to erase me
A couple days, no talking, I see my baby
And this what she tells me

[Hook]
She said: I keep on running, keep on running, and nothing works
I can't get away from you, no
I keep on ducking, keep on ducking you, nothing helps
I can't stop missing you

[Verse 2 - Kid Cudi]
It's like I'm her new nightmare, she ain't escaping
It makes me feel a bit complete
Knowing someone you love don't feel the same way about ya
Memories they soon delete
A couple weeks, no talking, I see my baby
I missed you so damn much
Hey, I wish we could start over, I told my baby
This what this bitch tells me

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Yeah, cause I'm in the magazines, on the TV
No matter where you are, you might hear me
I'm in the magazines, on the TV
No matter where you go, you might see me

[Verse 3 - Kanye West]
I'm Yeezy, she say "Hi, I'm Aria"
No, you a angel, you wave "Hi" to Aaliyah
I got a show in Korea, they built a new arena
Why don't you come and watch a nigga tear the whole scene up
I know I seen you before, but don't know where I seen ya
Oh I remember now, it's something that I dreamed of
Don C says she cool, but don't let her fuck your cream up
Monica Lewinsky on the dress, you take her to the cleaners
Sure enough, a week later, I'm in extra love
And everybody know she's mine so she extra plugged
Every bouncer, every club show her extra love
We just praying the new fame don't get the best of us
But all good things gotta come to a en-a
She let it go to her head, "No, not my Aria"
The height of her shopping was writer's blocking me
I couldn't get my shit out anyway, I hope you die Aria![Produced by Hector Delgado, A$AP Rocky, Vulkan the Krusader, Jim Jonsin, Finatik N Zac]

[Intro]
For all them hoes that was frontin' on niggas back in the days, man
(This for my broke jiggy niggas)
You know what I'm saying?
Excuse me, fuck out my face
They say wealth is in the mind, not the pocket
I learned that from a very wise man

Gotta pocket full of stones like Pimp say

[Verse 1]
Okay excuse me, Mr. Bill Collector, I got problems
My check arrive mañana, I'ma pay my debt, I promise
I spent 20 thousand dollars with my partners in Bahamas
Another 20 thousand dollars on Rick Owens out in Barneys
I said excuse me, why the fuck you lookin'? What's your problem?
I swear we gon' have drama if you touch my tailored garments
All you see is niggas here, so that means it's triggers there
What you mean? We got weed, and codeine and bricks for sale
I bet a lot of niggas plottin' so you know I got that heater, bruh
Drive my side of Harlem, catch me ridin' with my nina, bruh
She got an apple bottom that remind you of Bonita, bruh
Oh you mean like Q-Tip? Now that girl my new bitch
Excuse me, no, I believe the proper term's excuse you
I could switch up on you niggas and start shittin' if I choose to
That's when the new you becomin' different since they knew you
I guess the new me is just gon' take some gettin' used to

[Hook]
Excuse me, I tell them they're excused
What's the word around town, tell me what's the latest news
And uh, who them niggas, I tell 'em we them dudes
Ain't got time to make excuses bruh we steady making moves
And I, run the game even when they bend the rules
I pay very close attention after that I pay my dues
And uh, excuse me, may I be excused?
Cause I gave this shit my all, ain't got nothing left to lose

[Verse 2]
Tell me why these little niggas talking like they killas, bruh
Nowadays these niggas always caught up in they feelings, bruh
But I stay 100 cause you know I keep it trilla, bruh
Mobbin like 2Pacalypse or Bishop how I Hit 'Em Up
Fill 'em up with lyrics, bury all my victims, kill 'em
Dig 'em up again, to say I did it
Snitch, excuse me, mind your business, bruh
Swear that you could get it, girl
She a fashion killa, huh? Killa girl, I'm a go-getter, she get it, girl
Flacko, where you been? I've been thuggin' with my niggas, bruh
Flacko, how you been? I'm still thuggin' with my niggas, bruh
Flacko, where you been? I've been thuggin' with my niggas, bruh
Flacko, how you been? I've been thuggin' with my...
Buggin' with my niggas, go sluggin'
Tell me who fuckin' with my niggas
Who run it, my niggas, fuck the fussin', they buckin' and bussin'
Now niggas slump over Robitussin in public
Cup full of purple substance or something
My niggas, the only thing that move me:
'Excuse me'

[Hook]
Excuse me, I tell them they're excused
What's the word around town, tell me what's the latest news
And uh, who them niggas, I tell 'em we them dudes
Ain't got time to make excuses bruh we steady making moves
And I, run the game even when they bend the rules
I pay very close attention after that I pay my dues
And uh, excuse me, may I be excused?
Cause I gave this shit my all, ain't got nothing left to lose

[Outro]
Flacko (x12)She was a Friday night star
Everyone knew her name but the fame didn’t take her far
And she was in awe
Trying to imitate the lifestyle that she saw
And there was no cars
Living illusions
Dream illusive chasing cars
A tongue so harsh
She could persuade a million soldiers into the dark

[Hook]
So just wait up a minute lady
Pop them breaks for a minute you’re so mistaken
I say you look awfully shady
Or maybe you’re just contemplating a Friday night star
(shes a superstar)
A Friday night star
A Friday night star
(shes a superstar)
A Friday night star

Jessica, I’m thinking I could probably take her home and marry her
But everything I keep on hearing makes me scared of her
And now I know I probably should have never messed with her
But she got me grabbing my coat and keys and I did I did
I get on the express way and speed to her crib, her crib
I just loose control everytime I see all those hips and lips
And it feels just like an evil deed
But I slip, I slip

[Hook]
So just wait up a minute lady
Pop them breaks for a minute you’re so mistaken
I say you look awfully shady
Or maybe you’re just contemplating a Friday night star
(shes a superstar)
A Friday night star
A Friday night star
(shes a superstar)
A Friday night star

Yeah,yeah
She’s dressed for the Friday night lights
With her boots zipped up, her jeans tight
Wondering, tryna find the right type
But there’s dogs round here and they might bite
I sit back, then stare in amazement
As these girls go awfully crazy
They don’t know me
But they know that they play my song on the radio station
And I climb on top of the stage
Wait for the beat when it drop, then I sing
Everybody get poured up, then drink
Then by the end of the night they faint
After the pause, I fade to the dark
Everybody please give a round of applause
I leave to the car, she waits for me patiently by the bar

[Hook]
So just wait up a minute lady
Pop them breaks for a minute you’re so mistaken
I say you look awfully shady
Or maybe you’re just contemplating a Friday night star
(shes a superstar)
A Friday night star
A Friday night star
(shes a superstar)
A Friday night star

So just wait up a minute lady
Pop them breaks for a minute you’re so mistaken
I say you look awfully shady
Or maybe you’re just contemplating a Friday night star
(shes a superstar)
A Friday night star
A Friday night star
(shes a superstar)
A Friday night star[Verse 1]
I'mma do my thing
Let me tell you right now
Cause I don't know any other way
Of living my life now
Some of you know the struggle
Some of you live in a bubble
Some like you hustlin
And some of you just looking for trouble
I don't follow or lead
Tommorows a dream
Pray to god to intervene
On all the sorrow I've seen
You want out of here
You can leave when you wanna
Nothing can stop you
If thats your type of persona
Life is shorter now
Don't make me say it ten times
I keep going for mine
Even in the end times
I can beat the system
Come on and say it with me:
Show me some optimism
We can take over the city!

[Hook]
This is for my real life representers, down since the first day
Gangstas, hustlas, grinding out around the way
Can't stop, gotta be always on the paper chase
Have to get it, they won't give it, but I get it anyway
[I get it anyway]
Regardless what the haters say
I'mma get it anyway!
I'mma get it anyway!
[I get it anyway]
Regardless what the haters say
I'mma get it anyway!
I'mma get it anyway!

[Verse 2]
There comes a time in your life
You gotta go for yours
Staying paid
Is like the battle of forever more
I stay pedal to the metal
Foot on the floor
Earn my keep on the streets
Knocking down your doors
I'm by the dollar
Like everybody oughta be
Don't burn nobody
And make the money honestly
Open your home with the internet technology
I get it anyway
Despite of the economy
See I ain't coughin
Unless it makes a profit
I'm dropping this so hot shit
Like every day gossip
Regardless of the climate
I'm gonna get it everyday
Even if the bullets spray
I'm gonna get it anyway

[Hook]
This is for my real life representers, down since the first day
Gangstas, hustlas, grinding out around the way
Can't stop gotta be always on the paper chase
Have to get it, they won't give it, but I get it anyway

Don't wanna make an honest dollar
You wanna sip a little
To make your pain numb
Tippin that bottle
Got you forgettin where you came from
But I'm the same one
Where you think my name's from
I'mma keep it moving
And never stop till the game's done
Forever we live it, forever we spit it
Remember the minute
You witnessed the realest that ever did it
[Quit it!]
Still I'm committed
No matter what I hear from the critic
People can see through a gimmick

Swerving through the double lines
You run ahead on collision course
Now you served your time

Trina finna show you how to get this money, right

[Verse 1]
You gotta have a J-O-B to be with me
Best believe I'm going diamond on my next LP
I stacked my game up, sexed my frame up
Bitches using my style, I'm set to change up
Unh, new year, new gray Jag
After the first album, you should hear Shay brag
I been around the world playing 2-way tag
While these wannabe Trinas out here claim bad
But guess what, I'm still the baddest
Jewels still flooded with 24 karats
OK, you know I live lavish
Chanel glass slippers in a Cinderella palace

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Unh, unh, See me on South Beach rolling the five
When I come through hoes rolling they eyes
I'm the- baddest bitch, so I'm used to that
Draped in the hot shit off the Gucci rack
I like Tiffany ice, that expensive stuff
The diamond princess draped in princess cuts
Don't be mad ho, cause I'm that bad ho
Pushing that pink Lamborghini Diablo
I play niggas like dummies for the fast money
You wanna holla, it's gon' cost you cash money
Slip and slide, then we stacking chips
The redbone, wonder woman with the platinum wrist

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Breakdown
Miami hot, 'Candy' flopped
I'm the new bad girl and I can't be stopped
Unh, sipping Bailey's, flossing daily
On TRL with Carson Daly
Dressed to kill, ice, extra chill
Touch of class, bad with the sex appeal
Flawless baby, female ballers baby
Stay diggin' in them millionaires wallets baby
Tored up, Christian Dior'd up
Cases of that Cris, gettin poured up
Got it sewed up, like stitches
Reppin' for my bad bitches, stackin' riches
I shine, baby cause the game is mine
I'm on top of the charts, no room to climb
And when I say I'm the baddest, I'm mean it
Me and this cash, can't nothing come between this

[Chorus] - repeat 2X[Nelly]
Gone, gone - she got me gone
Girl you know you got me gone

[Kelly Rowland]
Nelly got me gone, gone, gone, gone
Boy you know you got me gone

[Nelly]
Yeah... uhh, ay
'Member that chick that used to live right up the block from me?
I seen her yesterday, and she's still fly
She's still right, still tight, still fine
Yup, I still wanna make her mine
And uhh, I want much more than just a moment
See I ain't tryin to lease or tryin to rent, I'm tryin to own it
Yeahhhh, this time I'll make my move
This time I'll show and prove, prove that I'm really irreplacable
Plus I don't know if she ever been told
But I got whatever she needs, yeah
And whichever way we go
No one could ever take what we've got
Right here between one another
Don't care what they say, you gon' be my lover
And if it's in-love baby, I wanna fall
Just promise me baby, you'll be here through it all

[Hook: Nelly] + (Kelly)
I'd do it all again if I have to, throw this money at you
Girl you know you got me gone

And if it's in-love baby, I wanna fall
Just promise me baby, you'll be here through it alllllllllllllll

[Nelly]
Look shawty I done told you once, pay attention I'mma tell you twice
I done been around the world but I never met a girl like you in my whole life
It's somethin you need to know, you make me wanna get physical
You make me wanna get intimate, into it, I'm fixin to blow
All my heart, and all my time
I'll give you everything that you wanted, baby just name your price
Mine is yours, and yours is mine
Trust me that's a fact girl; you ain't gotta ask cause
I don't know if you ever been told
But I got whatever you need, girl

Now that I'm finally free
I'm bouta throw it today
I take my life in my hands
Cause I'm a grown-ass man
(I'm a grown-ass man)
Now that I'm finally free

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I was lost, but now I'm found
I was blind, but now I see
Super high, can't touch the ground
Life tested me, but God blessin' me
Every 16 bars is a testimony
From the jailhouse junk to the Testarossa
Had to find myself, then remind myself
Fuck up, I'm grown, I got to blame myself
Streets taught me everything, I trained myself
Dead wrong so long, didn't know nothin' else
They wanna lock my crew up like ???
Think every man ??? and amuse himself
Glad as well, but I'm mad as hell
Because my best friend probably gon' die in jail
Ain't no lie to tell, probably cry like hell
If I dwell on it, cause he got 80 years
I'm going hard, you see I might as well
Cause I got a hard head like my daddy had
And my daddy's dead
I bet my great great great great grandpa had a real crazy swag
So I stand today, then get down to pray
???? and my mind is made
I got a point to prove, and a son to raise
Can't let him make mistakes that his daddy made

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Squash the beef I'm free of that
This crazy song, they ain't feelin' that
I guess they wanna see us kill each other
If I'm dead, who the fuck gonna help my mother
I done struggled and hustled too hard for this
I done rob stealed killed, ain't proud of that
Smoke weed, took pills, ???
I'm a soldier ??? where the cowards at?
Man your homeboy gone where the flowers at
All the money in the world can't bring that back
If I had one wish, wish mom and dad could
Come down now and see me rap
But she see me now, and I believe in that
On the strength of that I ain't goin' back
So I put my whole family on my back
Lost so much time, can't pay that back
I was lost, but now I'm found
I was blind, but now I see
Super high, can't touch the ground
Life tested me, but God blessin' me
Every 16 bars is a testimony
From the jailhouse junk to the Testarossa
Had to find myself, then remind myself
Fuck up, I'm grown, I got to blame myself
It's Gucci

[Hook] x2

[Outro: Estelle]
I was lost, but now I'm found
Don't you ?? then keep me down
See my life go round and round
I say I straightened up my act
And I ain't never goin' back

Now that I' m finally free (finally free)
You'll never take me away (you'll never take me away)
Took everything that I have (everything that I)
???????????
Now that I'm finally free (oh finally free)
I'm bouta throw it today (throw it today)
I take my life in my hands (I take my life in my hands)
Cause I'm a grown-ass man (I'm a grown-ass man)
Now that I'm finally free
I'm a grown-ass man[Verse 1]

If I could turn back time, then I make it so that you were my boo
I wish I never met you boy..
Everytime I'm with my man, all I do is sit and think of you
Don't wanna feel the way I feel about you

Verse 1: Trina
When we first got together I saw us chillin' forever
A lifetime bestfriend for worse or for better
Then you switched up the weather, sunshine to clouds
I found a condom in your dresser and you know how we get down
You fuckin' clown now I wish I never met you
I should've listened to mama, she said you wasn't nothin' special
So now its to the left, to the left...
And everything you own is on the porch, nigga step!
And tell me...

What would you do if you were in my shoes?
Would you make it work or would you wanna choose?
Between the one you love and between the one you hate
Cause thats just how it is...

Chorus: 1x

Verse 2: Trina
Maybe I'm trippin', or I just can't figure you out
One night you say you love me, the next you flippin' out
But you can bounce, you know I don't need a man
I'm sorry I met you I could do bad by my damn self
I can't let you disrespect me, I'mma queen..
And all my real boss chicks know what I mean
I bet you still trickin', you ain't learned your lesson
Now let me check your text messages...hahaa
Now tell me...

(Shonie)
What would you do if you were in my shoes?
Would make it work or would you wanna choose?
Between the one you love and between the one you hate
Cause that's just how it is...

Chorus: 1x

(Shonie)
Picture me and you together
Everything about you make my whole body shiver..
It's you I want in my world
It's you that I adore

I said I picture me and you together
Everything about you make my whole body quiver...
It's you that I want in my world
It's you that I adore

Chorus:1x[Hook]
Uhh, uhh, uhh
I was thinkin 'bout her, thinkin 'bout me
Thinkin 'bout us, where we gon' be?
Opened my eyes, yeah
It was only just a dream
So I travel back, down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realize, yeah
It was only just a dream

[Verse 1]
I was at the top and now it's like I'm in the basement
Number one spot, now she found her a replacement
I swear now I can't take it
Knowin somebody's got my baby
And now you ain't around, baby I can't think
I shoulda put it down, shoulda got that ring
Cause I can still feel it in the air
See her pretty face, run my fingers through her hair
My lover, my life
My shorty, my wife
She left me, I'm tight
Cause I knew that it just ain't right

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
When I be ridin man I swear I see her face at every turn
Tryin to get my Usher on but I can't let it +Burn+
And I just hope she know that she the only one I yearn - for
My woman, oh I miss her, when will I learn?
Didn't give her all my love, I guess now I got my payback
Now I'm in the club thinkin all about my baby
Hey, she was so easy to love
But wait, I guess that love wasn't enough
I'm goin through it every time that I'm alone
And now I'm missin, wishin she pick up the phone
But she made a decision that she wanted to move on
Cause I was wrong

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
And now they're gone and you wishin you could give them everything
Everything (heyyy)
Said if you ever loved somebody put your hands up
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
And now they're gone and you wishin you could give them everything[Produced by Jim Jonsin and Finatik N Zac]

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Is this the top? Uh
I got my own weed, sucker, so I ain't gotta hit yours
I'm talking straight indo
Cali weed blowing like a Rastaman
Kush seed straight from Afghanistan
Shooting up the club like an AK, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow
Smoke a P strong every day, I'm

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Blowing KK, blowing KK, blowing KK, blowing KK
Blowing KK, blowing KK, blowing KK, blowing KK
Blowing KK, blowing KK, blowing KK, blowing KK
Blowing KK, blowing KK, blowing KK, blowing KK
I need it all the time, don't know what else to say
It's always on my mind, that's why every day
I'm blowing KK, blowing KK, blowing KK, blowing KK
Blowing KK, blowing KK, blowing KK, blowing KK

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Put it in a joint, not a blunt
Don't disrespect mine, player
This not the two, this the one
Don't even need a scale
Back in high school I used to be the weedman
Quarter ounces, half ounces, what you need, man
Eleventh grade, made my way up to a P, man
And sent it back if I ever seen a seed, man
And you don't even gotta ask
You know it by the smell
I treat every day like it's a payday
Top down, counting up the cake and

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
I got KK in my pipe, pockets fat like Kelly Price
If you wanna take a hit you can't be afraid of heights
You gon' need some new lungs, roll me up a blunt-a-thon
While I'm smoking out the bong getting sucked like a thumb
Boy I’m in a daze, tangerine haze
I smoke so much KK they should've called it Juicy J
Bombay and lemonade, weed get the lemon taste
Never hit the bong, let me demonstrate

[Verse 3: Project Pat]
Go and roll it, chief and choking, marijuana, reefer smoking
Trap the semi sum under Reggie, foot up in his colon
Call the doctor, call the clinic, bullshit we staying with
Your life ain't worth a motherfuckin' quarter but you payin' with it
Khalifa kush a hundred pounds, that's a half a mil
Memphis streets so eat this like a baby, like Enfamil
Lungs full of KK, have your mind on a runway
Blow my high, motherfucker, I'mma shoot up like an AK

[Verse 4: Juicy J]
My white house higher than Willie Nelson, on dabs the wax is melting
These clouds are smoking, help me, I'm flying like Elroy Jetson
I might bring a dispensary down in Tennessee
Whole pounds of grandaddy, but he ain't no kin to me
(I’m staying with the greens, like collard)

[Verse]
I know I dream about her all day
I think about her with her clothes off
I'm ridin' 'round with my system bumpin' LSD
I look for ways to say "I love you"
But I ain't into makin' love songs
Baby, I'm just rappin' to this LSD
She ain't a stranger to the city life
I introduced her to this hippy life
We make love under pretty lights, LSD (Acid)
I get a feelin' it's a trippy night
Them other drugs just don't fit me right
Girl, I really fuckin' want love, sex, dream
Another quarter to the face system
Make no mistakes, it's all, a leap of faith for love
It takes a place in, feelin' that you crave doin' love, sex, dreams

[Chorus]
It started in Hollywood
Dreamin' of sharin' love
My tongue at a loss for words
Cause my feelings just said it all
Party just started up
Dreamin' of sharin' worlds
Held this feeling for way too long
Said, "I really wanna let it go"

[Bridge 1]
I've been gettin' fly because the gimmick's so dope
I've been getting high cause I figured Lord told me
I've been drinking, driving, now we'll never go home
I gon' stay in doubt because the weather's so cold, oh

[Bridge 2]
Feeling low sometimes when the light shines down
Makes me high
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Feeling low sometimes when the light shines down
Makes me high
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

[Chorus]
It started in Hollywood
Duh, duh-duh
Dreamin' of sharin' love
Duh, duh-duh
My tongue at a loss for words
Cause my feelings just said it all

[Outro]
I look for ways to say, "I love you"
But I ain't into makin' love songs
Baby I'm just rappin' to this LSD[Hook: Lil Wayne]
My leather so soft, my top so soft
I'll probably have it off, these niggas so soft
And I go so hard
Bitch, I go so hard
She said my leather so soft, my top so soft
I'll probably have it off, these niggas so soft
And I go so hard
Bitch, I go so hard

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I get money, ho, fuck what you talkin' 'bout
Straight out the slaughterhouse straight out the dragon's mouth
Fire you can't put out tires are standin' out
The coupe look pigeon-toed I be in a different mode
I be with them different hoes, no I mean them different hoes
I mean them Weezy bumbaclot different hoes
And as far as terrific goes, they kiss that dick with no mistletoes
Diamonds and pearls and pussy hoes
Snortin' coke 'til they nose bleed
I'm sittin' high on them inches I'm in the nosebleeds
I'm on a paper chase until my toes bleed
Then I get on these beats and let my soul bleed
I put 'em in ya head and watch the holes bleed
My rag always red like when them hoes bleed
Now that's coldbleed I mean cold blooded
And I'm so southern that's why my leather so soft

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Birdman]
She soft as a bush nigga she purple like kush nigga
We high on that money nigga we get it from cook nigga
Hit her wit' that crook nigga fuckin' wit' crooks nigga
Know we 'bout that money and we stackin' like books nigga
Know what I do nigga them teardrops is true nigga
We stay so fly ride Bentley coupes nigga
Rolls Royce Corniches and asses by the beaches
Blowin' on that puff and we drivin' foreign features
Higher than whoever nigga know we 'bout that cheddar, nigga
Know I got a tommy gun gave one to my young'n son
And we got it together
.47, .51, you gon' hear us when we come, daddy

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
You see the paper gon' come if not I'm gon' get it
I gotta die with money cause I wasn't born wit 'it
It was 9-27-82 baby due
Charity Hospital aka the city zoo
No pity due to no one nobody not all
Man, they dropped us in the game and everybody's trying to ball
And the small hand'll touch ya, the large hand'll cut ya
But until that day, I'll be a mothafuckin' stunna, nigga

[Birdman]
Ball 'til I fall I done did it for my dawgs
Ball 'til I fall I done did it for y'all
Ball 'til I fall I done did it for me nigga
Ball 'til I fall that's the way it's gon' be nigga
Up in the early I done did it for sunshine
Candy on the paint everytime I touch mine
Nine stay cocked cause I'm good wit' firin' mines
Alligator wit' the suede ridin' them 25's

[Hook]
