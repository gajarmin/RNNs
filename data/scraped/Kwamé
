[Talking]
New York City
You are now rocking with the best
Lloyd Banks
G-Unit

[Hook]
We on fire
Up in here, it's burning hot
We on fire
Shorty take it off if it get to hot, up in this spot
We on fire
Tear the roof off this motherfucker, light the roof on fire
Nigga what you say
We get loose in this motherfucker, light the roof on fire fire fire

[Verse 1]
Now I ain't putting nothing out, I smoke when I wanna
26-inch chrome spokes on the Hummer
This heat gon last for the whole summer
Running your bitch faster then the Road Runner
Rocks on my wrist, rolls gold under
Glocks on my hip, those throw thunder
Im buying diamond by the pier
But when you stop, the only thing still spinning is your ear
Yeah, im riding with that all black snub
Raiders cap back, all black gloves
Im 80s man, but the boy smack thugs
These record sales equal more back rubs
Not to mention I bought a pack of clubs
His impacts about as raw as crack was
Now all these new artists getting raw deals
Im only 21, sitting on mills

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
If you know anything about me, then you know im a baller
If I ain't hit the first night, I ain't gon call her
Im trying to play, you trying to have my daughter
But I can't blame her for what her momma taught her
And I don't care bout what the next nigga bought her
Cause I ain't putting no baguettes in her butter
I got a diamond about as clear as water
And I got bread, but I ain't spend quarters
So cut the games ma, lets go in the back
Matter fact, turn your ass round, back a nigga down
And I ain't bias when im riding through the town
Like em small, like em tall, like em black, like em brown
She gotta be able to come when I need her
Tight ass pants, little wife beater
Regular chick or R&B diva
Bitch say something, I ain't a mind reader

[Hook]This the year of the BlackSmith
Talib Kweli, Kwame, let's go

Yeah, niggas don't listen
Back in the days we all used to listen
Now shit is so wack, nobody listen
To that real hip hop, yo, listen

[Hook]
Ladies and gentlemen, get ready, here I come
Talib Kweli and I'm bangin' on ya eardrum
Something I wanna tell you
Now lemme get up in it, wait, wait, wait, wait

[Verse 1]
Friends, Romans, Countrymen, lend me ya ears
Stop repentin' cause the ending is near
But don't panic, you can't function if you livin' in fear
Pay attention, you gotta listen to hear
(Wait just a minute), who the fuck you think talkin' to?
Put you on hold, get a specialist to walk you through
Kweli, the flow captain of fast and slow rappin'
I'm so crackin', you ain't heard? Ya shit appear like closed captions
King of the bars and I'm goin' hard, pause
All my confidence comes from knowin' God's Laws
Bangin' on the system, fightin' my kinda war
Loud as a whisper, quiet as a lion's roar

[Hook]
Ladies and gentlemen, get ready, here I come
Talib Kweli and I'm bangin' on ya eardrum
(Something I wanna tell you)
Now lemme get up in it, it's for ya spirit so
But y'all hear me though
Get up, get into it and get involved
There's a little something that I wanna spit for y'all
(Something I wanna tell you)
Now lemme get up in it, wait, wait, wait, wait

[Verse 2]
Get it now, get it fast, get it right
Get it big, get it locked, get it done, get it tight
(I think I wanna feel you)
But you don't really hear me though
I spit clearly so it's live outcha stereo
To your heart while it's beatin' in ya chest
When you speakin' to execs and they see behind the desk
To ya spirit, nothing weaker than the flesh
So while you try to keep it fresh, you gettin' deeper into debt
Real hip hop is missin' from the shelf
Yup, it's what you felt when you listen to yaself
Only a few is makin' cuts that's spinnin'
So before you spend ya hard earned spinach

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You love the sounds comin' out your speaker
I spit rounds like a nine millimeter
The youth today, they frown at the teachers
They ain't down with no leaders
They don't wanna wait (just a minute)
They like, "What? Nigga, wait right there"
I got 'Reservoir Dogs', you'll be missin' a right ear
Get it clear, I figure it's my year
I'm everywhere makin' appearances and niggas might miss
Hear the word, peep the flow, check the cadence
What you heard as a pro, I'm so amazing
Don't front, girl, you know it's ya favorite
New Kweli, yo, they runnin' out of patience

[Hook]

Yo, don't it sound so good to you?
It's the return of the greatest, y'all
Talib Kweli, BKMC
BlackSmith is the movement, BlackSmith is the music
Whatchu ridin' for?
Whatchu livin' for?
Whatchu dyin' for?
(I think I wanna feel you)
Bangin' on ya eardrum, yeah

Wait now, wait now, wait now for a minute
Listen
Wait now, wait now, wait now for a minute[Verse 1]
Listen close to the musical member of Mensa
School of Hard Knocks got Tenure
My lectures advance, the Einstein of my time
Stephen Hawking, when I'm chalking my rhymes
E equals MC Squared, Yeah that's true but this MC here
You can't box in
I.Q of Socrates's, Lyrical Doctrine
Philosophies, Methodically written within the conscious
Beautiful mind, R.Crow, Nas Flow, not him, Nostradamus
Some say I'm dreaming, so pinch me
I am Da vinci, over 186,000 miles of quick speed on this beat
Let me enlighten you
Kissinger of Literature, NASA of Rappers
Over your head, Shooting Star out of your reach
Supernova Instead - Hip Hop's Willy Shakes slash Billy Gates
They just Microsoft – small thing to a giant
Possessed by the ghost of Steve Jobs, See iRap
Something like Beethoven, Fur Elise with these bars
A great poet, Langston Hughes, I've paid my dues
Murs could speak, to voucher
Omega Alpha, End of the beginning
Julius Caesar, Nucleus Ether

[Verse 2]
Molecules, phenomenal, combined with the logical thoughts
So astronomical, gotta record on satellites
No LSAT required, but I pulled a 180
No turning back, I learned from past errors
It's all mathematical -- Let me break it down
Divide and Conquer, Underground so I guess I subtract
A.D.D multiplied equals one fact
My intricate, rhymes patterns are infinite
Indicative of scholars, but primitive artist limit is dollars
Makes no sense, in comparison they are no threat
My intel processes faster then your PC's
Musical 3-D,Out of this world you can call me E.T
I Spielberg, When I spill words, I still observe
MC's on MP3's, Telescope Flow
I'm better then ever those
Rappers that bloggers forever pose
But never ever will blow
Except in the offices
They are all soft as shit, from babies orifices
But ya'll down get it
In a different time zone, with my poems
Light bulb over head call it Edison
Ya'll sick I got the medicine
And I'm a motherfucken VeteranLadies and gentlemen
The Kit-Kat Club is proud to present
Something new, something different
So would you please give a warm welcome to
The Rhythm

Well I came here for something funky to happen
Is this Christmas cuz everybody's rappin
You better get sparked by the song that I sing
Although my name ain't Martin Luther
But I'm considered the king
Yo, my beats pumped by the mic I clamp
I don't need an amplifier
My brain is the amp
I got the beats to make you tingle
Make your body mingle
Like you got the fever for the flavor of a Pringle
Weak I say not so
I'm just like Picasso
A pioneer
I am here
Ask me how I got so fly
Any sense that I can give 'em
A New Beginning Stevie-o
And my dope rythm
I sent the Lord master give a mental harm
My sole chief belief is that Islam
My beats pumped
So let it grab ya
I got a trick but my name ain't Ali-Baba
So open Sesame
Neva' heard the best of me
Betcha all the people intheplaceiswacknowlet'ssee
It's a New Beginning, my name Kwame
And if you didn't know I could tell you that I'm a
Mellow cool brotha
Slicker than oil
Rap get so hot it makes the spit boil
The Rhythm

Not the average rapper
The K is more
Rhymes like the thunderbolts of the mighty Thor
Be goin' wit' yourself
Cuz I can conquer boy
I break MCs
Like a Tonka toy
Smooth, suave, savoir faire, debonair
Come in the party yeah I see you stop and stare
To hear the man to only have yo hand shook
You dress GQ to me you got The Jordache Look
Cuz I'm the mystical
Rap is polyphystical
Ask about Kwame
Hey say he is a cool fella
He's always mellow
He's neva high-stung spark
When the mic is near him
It cleva I run smooth like Moet
Recite just like a poet
Ain't my slam oh yeah I know it
Cuz when I'm on the mic while boys say oh golly
Slick on my tip like the hip on Polygrip
I go cameo be on the Grammy show
I be sleek as a sheik I'll freak any ho
In the panty hose pumping clothes
Yo my rhymes slam well I suppose cuz
I'm might meander Hmm... throw a shenanigan
To write a fresh rhyme you know I can again
Cuz I destroy bust 'em like a hemorrhoid
Strong like a steroid avoid the Noid
The Rhythm

The black can take a rap the M A X
And as I step in the party that's when they ask
For me to get on strong no fear like a gladiator
Turn on steam up MCs like a radiator
Play 'em all out executioner style
Speak my peace just release refusing to smile
This is serious though I rap a little humor
But still MCs I hear assume I could neva
Bust a fat rap twice
And at that price
On any mic you gave me I got nice
I push a pull up a sit up get up I'm fed up
Shut ya lip up and let's go head up
Poisonous as venom no mistakes in 'em
Gucci on silk you got Vasco in denim
No my name ain't Taco, Emilio or Paco
But Kwame boy and I got yo
Chick on the side cuz she sweatin' my tip
Gave a peck on the neck just to wetten my lip
I don't drop my pants for no Raggedy Anns
Just to pass up a chance on a kids romance
I should have blown this mic
Like I said I might
Got the force of 20 men like a Jedi knight
And
It's kinda hard for me not to do it slow
So
I gotta go
The Rhythm[Intro]
(I ain't scared of nothing)

[Bridge: Somaya Reese x2]
Wild out, this is it, bless your shit, lunatic
You ain't scared, go ahead, put your hands high
Get 'em

[Hook: Chino XL x4]
My only weakness is
I ain't scared of nothing

[Verse 1: Chino XL]
That nigga Chino XL is a cold menace
That ain't scared of nothing like I got no nerve endings
With the sickest sentence that is known from here to Venice
Since Rick Rubin signed my demo, been stronger than wooly mammoths
Heart darker than Black Sabbath
A real master of words that causes Havoc like Prodigy's partner's parents
Syllable chemist, was 16 with my first 12"
Destine
I had no choice like an arranged marriage
Like an inbred, tie you up in a toolshed
Hang you upside down and beat you till your piss turns red
Make you an invalid
Yes I'm sick and into it
It makes my heart warm like hating my father when I was a kid
No saving grace, I'm using razor blades to slash your arms
You're left for days and ate by gators in the Everglade swamps
I ain't scared of nothing, I'm stubborn, a live wire
My name in sign language is a middle finger on fire

[Hook x4]

[Bridge x2]

[Verse 2: Chino XL]
I'm that brolic god of carnage that would body college
Sick as gynecologists, spit collagen at live pirahanas
Eat cyanide olives by a cottage in the farthest forest
Burning down a farmer's crops just when he was about to harvest
My vocal cords will murder yours from sheer power wattage
Your comments, "Why did the plague of Chino rain down upon us?"
Silence
I'm breaking your legs, you're nauseous
You can't run again like a president that already served two terms in office
Living lawless, raw performance for the riches
Put you down like toliet seats when you live in a house full of bitches
Sicker than Caeser's syphilis
And Jonbenet Ramsey's killers
And pictures of Natalie Holloway's titties (can I get a witness?)
My spirit is big so I don't fear a thing
I'll karate kick Steven Segal in his lace front wig
Fuck a pig
Hop out the whip and shatter your ribs
Wearing a mask in broad daylight like Michael Jackson's kids did
And I'll flip and then whip you to death with a marble bar stool
And dig up your corpse so I can drive in the lane for car pool
How do you think you can threaten the metaphor weapon
That's responsible for inventing this industry's rebellion?
Hellion
Dark scoundrel
Me fearing someone?
Over my dead body nigga, Gary Coleman

[Hook x4]

[Bridge x2]

[Interlude]
(I ain't scared of nothing)

[Verse 3: Chino XL]
Lungs of a champion
I take one breath and start an album and don't breathe again until I'm sitting at mastering
Chino the ambassador, caster of the spell of a massacre
Hell is the task of thee assassin that does more spazing per capita
Serving half of the bastard rappers, inhaling cancer, breath out asthema
Dump your body in the back of a factory canister
My position is vivid, if it's a gimmick I give it
60 minutes than exhibit the sickest village verbal spillage
Worship my words
I got more game than Wild Life Preserves
I'm purging out sperm in a perma perm in a groupie birth
I stand firm in the stance that Chino XL is the handsomest
No time for romance and shit, I'm on my Charles Manson shit
I got so many bars that I could apply for a liquor license
Not the lesbian type that's dyking but Viking trips I'm writing
Where my similes are similar and liken to a Lycan
Werewolf in the night that'll have you and your Christ afterlife you liking
I'm fighting, managing, keeping savage at all costs
Fuck showers I'm dragging Mark Zimmerman through a car wash
I rhyme to the point of exhaust and killing everybody
And copied 16 and sloppy and played out like Ed Hardy
You started, I'm slashing, I don't wanna hear you're sorry
Leave your face fractured, twisted backward like Whitney's baby daddy Bobby
I'm the illest is what the gossip is
Wanna rep your state?
Alright, I'm beat you into the state of unconsciousness
Monsterous until I'm posthumous it's obvious
Me fearing anybody breathing, simply nonsense

[Hook x4][Intro: Kwamé]
This - this is brought to you
By the K-1 Emergency Broadcasting System
In the - in the event of an actual emergency
You will be told to...
Fall out
Fall out
Fall out
Fall out
Fall out

[Method Man]
S.I., rockin' it
N.Y., rockin' it
Shit, we stay poppin' it
4-5, rockin' it
Game, stay on top of it
Lame, just the opposite
It's no thang, when I bring the pain ain't no stopping it (hold on)
Who the fuck is this? About to bring the ruckus
This just ya boy, I'm some on other shit
My nigga, take a puff of this
Piff man, I'm loving this, is Staten Island up in this?
Bitch, like we running it, and somebody wanna public (I'm coming)
Turn it up a bit, so my thugs can thug a bit
If I got my brother get, K, we got another hit
Ladies please, where y'all puffin' them trees?
I'm damaging M.C.'s, oxygen, you can't breathe, fall

[Hook: Method Man (Kwamé)] (2x)
Fall out, yeah, I'm going all out (hold on)
Hold on, man, what's really going on (I'm coming)
And when I'm coming, a hundred miles & running (keep back)
Keep back, y'all ain't got it like that (fall out)

[Method Man]
Here we go again, herb-smoke, blowing in the wind
Cops chasing, wanna throw him in the pen
And the day he leave the game, yo, he going in the Benz
On them 24's looking like he rolling on the rims
All daying, knawimsayin', I'm staying up to par, parleyin'
While y'all hating, I'm splitting this cigar
Man, it's nathan, all y'all do is aim and start spraying
Cuz tonight's the night, and me and my niggas ain't playing (keep back)
Y'all done did it now, another critic kicked Tical
Alotta niggas mad cuz I ain't fold like they figure, now
Let me put my fitted down
*hwak*
Spit around
Listen when this hit the ground, y'all gon' hear the difference now
Here I got that miracle, sickest individual
Flow that's so original, see this is what they meant to do
It's not an act, it's all actual fact
The kid is back, making tracks, catch panic attacks, and fall

[Hook] (2x)

[Method Man]
Aww shit, ain't this about a bitch
I give a fuck about a bitch, I'm more about a grip
And I'm all that a nigga got, the more he gotta get
Feeling like a million dollars, buyin' million dollar shit (keep back)
What y'all dealing with, one shot killing it
Stop changing my style, when y'all stop stealing it
Meth is chillin' like milk top killing
If it ain't got no real in it, I'm probably not feeling it (keep back)
I'm deadin' ya kids, and burn another blizz
What it is, what it is, Wu-Tang is for the kids
So niggas please, why y'all puffin' them trees
I'm damaging M.C.'s, oxygen, they can't breathe, fall

[Hook] (2x)[Verse: 1]
Let's call it a stick up, let's call it a show down
Miss Money Mae came to shut it down
Everybody on your feet when the beat drop
Let me see the girls take the booty down
I'm up in this thing, I'm all classy shit
Ice top glass with my champagne poured in it
Two sips, booty shaking my hips
To the rhythm of the beat, let's go baby
It's getting hot under the spotlight
We in this club paint house dressed in white
Like Diddy, baby can you dig it?
This is how we do it when we come to your city

[Hook]
They call me
Miss Money, Money, Money Mae
Miss Money, Money, Money Mae
Can I drive your car, can I hold that cash
Drop a couple stacks in my hand
Miss Money, Money, Money Mae
Miss Money, Money, Money Mae
Can I drive your car, can I hold that cash
Drop a couple stacks in my hand

[Verse: 2]
Let's call it a robbery cause I came to take shit
Bet 'em big boys, yeah, that's my target
They call me a killer back in Jersey
The way I murder on the track real dirty, real gangsta
I see you bopping to the beat and I thank ya
Put your hands up, let me see you wave 'em
We got it looking like a hostage situation

[Hook]

[Verse: 3]
Let's slow it down right here while I catch my breath and breathe
I got my eye on big boy across the room and I can feel him watching me
Usually I call the shots but I can tell he packing heat
I need a boss that can help me set this off
Come on, let's get this money

[Hook][LL Cool J]
You can't call it a comeback
I lay back, analyse the rhymes and realise
I own that crown for lyrical
Combat
Spit more raps to count more stacks
Kickin back in the coup
I got loops relax, I'm hotness
Monotonous fans is runnin bizzack
L please don't leave the game like thizzat
Never in a million years
L'll never let you down baby
I drop 50, I steal gravy

[Hook: repeat 2X] (LL)
I look back on Venus
I look (I look) back on Mars
And (and) I burn with the fire
Of ten (of ten) million stars (guess who's back, uh)

[LL Cool J]
I'm more then a conqueror
Double up your bets
Come and rumble with the decks
I know you had that clown picked
Mind blowin out cos L still sound sick
You dream you was me
I gleam lyrically
I love 'em for it it's the highest form of flattery
Doin' the buck 10 chrome skating on the battery
My, clutch burnin' on top of the world turnin'
Rippers is just learnin by stacks I been earnin'
I'm the uncle L, future of the funk
Turn my joint up, find out why I'm different from all these chumps
And tell your favourite rapper that I'm ready to dump
For real cat, that represented rap from the jump

[Hook]

[LL Cool J]
Six figure interest on the cheddar
From music, fashion, film and televison
Poppin amaretto, so what'chu got a vendetta?
I never felt better
Now forever competition get severed by skills you can't measure
I'm a champ, you a peon
Kiss the ring, begone
Known and respected on any block you be on
And be on, stand there, get your md on
I chuckle 'cos there's nuthin' to waste energy on
There you have it
The uncut raw for rap addicts
Waited three years to see if L still had it
Ten million stars
Got beef to the death
End of my contract, I'm the last one left!

[Hook]

[Background: repeat 2X]
L worth paper
Ask Def Jam who put em up in that skyscraper
(Yeah, I take them seriously baby)
Ask my dogs up in old five, who made a major?
LL playa
Now who's next to need a paper, drop a bomb on em

[Hook plays]

[LL talking]
I look back on Venus
I look back on mars
And I burn with the fire
Of ten million stars[Hook: Megan Rochell]
We both know, that our love will grow
And forever, will be you and me...

[Method Man]
Give me a woman that get down for me, my one and only
That don't fuss or fuck around on me, or leave me lonely
Not just a honey, but a homey, just wanna hold me
Cuz she got alotta love for me, and put it on me
If I need that, plus she understand me when I beat that
It's sweet like candy, this time, I might just eat that
You steal my heart, sweetheart, then you can keep that
Let's bar hop and find us a spot where we can chief at
Push the seats back, you got the kinda body niggas beep at
Try to speak at, but get no feedback
Sophisticated, Miss Highly Edumicated
Living well, lady that made it, type of woman you stay with

[Hook]

[Method Man]
Give me a queen that respects a "king", just like Coretta
Get everything except the ring, for worse or better
Even through the stormy weather, rain, sleet, snow
Whatever, see if it go down, we go together
Like Twix bars, ain't no problem that we can't fix, ma
You ain't gotta sugar my tank, or key the kid car
Cuz broken hearts leave big scars, when emotions get hit hard
Niggas get drunk and hit the strip bar
But that ain't even ya man's style, even back as a manchild
That's where I stood, and where I stand now
I'm throwing rocks at your window pane
Trying to bang, girl, like injure pain, you know the game

[Hook]

[Megan Rochell]
No matter what we go through (what we go through)
I'll be there for you (there for you)
I'll never let you down, I'll just hold you down, oh-oooh
No matter where we be (where we be)
I'll do it all again (all again)
The ups and down, I'll hold you down, oh-oooh

[Method Man]
Give me a woman that get down for me, my one and only
She don't fuss or fuck around on me, or leave me lonely
Not just a honey, but a homey, just wanna hold me
Cuz she got alotta love for me, and now I gotta
Lotta love for her, might even take a slug for her
And everywhere we go, pull out that red rug for her
Yeah, them back rubs in the bathtub, got me cleaning my act up
I'm ready to shack up, now that's love

[Megan Rochell]
Nobody can love you like me boy
I'll promise to be your only girl
Don't ever leave, just stay
You will be down for me, anyway
Ahhhhhhhhhh, you and me together, baby

[Hook x4][Intro: A-Plus]
Yo, 1993- New year, new world champions
Hahaha like this

[Verse 1:]
Yo, the ill-minded mack will find the facts
I rhyme in Acs, niggas bound til I'm attacks
When niggas say I can't rhyme I recline
I'm the first to tell you, I got G's in my verse who tell me
It hurts a fella when I rip, because I'm sly slick
The nigga fly chicks ride with
I'm leaving niggas stranded man that's how I planned it
Landed blows with my random flows
And it goes -- a little something like this
And I might diss, with my right fist I strike kids like a pitcher do
I split your bitch you better switch or I twist ya
I play tricks like a mix
When booty niggas miss the beat
I figure that they wack I go and get my bat and get a pack of Swisher sweets
Plus be ill when I bust the grill but we chill
Who the fattest? {Hiero} It's batting practice

[Verse 2: Tajai]
It's no feat, how I defeat, weaker
Individuals set em up like give and go
A heat seeker, I take a bat and flatten your features
Beseech ya, proving I'll do that too
Cuz when you, pulls my clothes on and shrouded
I'm out with ya grip and you're pimpin so how did he
Do that shit, who dat kid, you're asking the masked man
Who fly higher than NASA
Ask friends what you need when I need your blockin
Then I leave you knocked in
Counts to call I trounce em all
With the quickness, using fitness, leave you fitless
Who got a problem with me ripping all that I do
I'm betting way more than you
Hey sure you knew my rhymes was fly
My lines imply that I'm fatter, next batter

[Hook 2x:]
It's like this y'all, it's like that y'all
I got a Hieroglyphics baseball bat y'all
It's like this y'all, it's like that y'all
I swing a Hieroglyphics baseball bat y'all

[Verse 3: Opio]
Get the fuck out, I never struck out
Better get the bucks out, and kick em down
Wrecking, extreme havoc when I'm practising
That could mean a loss of conciousness when I launches this
Back to the scene of the crime I'm never on sight
Untouchable, what you pulled another heist?
Precisely, I's be the man that did it
Said it, free up your posession never regretted
No anaesthetic so you're headed for some suffering
Bufferin can't ease the aches and pains of my-grains
When I trail this drain on your lifestyle
Pull a knife while, you give it up, simp
I'm a pimp got your ho and got your dough
And got the best flow in the universe, snatchin titles
Like a purse, niggas be the spot in a hearse
I'm worse, than the baddest, it's batting practice

[Verse 4: Phesto]
It's Phesto so keep your cash flow, Hey Presto
It's gone, right before your eyes, if you're wise
Another heist done nice when I slice
Your neck and snatch ya duffel bag with a sag
And I'm gagging your grill, dag I get ill
Dangerous if it's your brain I bust then take your
Chains and stuff, with the victimising, surprising
And I'm quick to size men, up with a swing to your grill
What I planned difficult that's split your skull
With a tool, if you ever fool, with the Souls
Did you ever think, if you blinked
I wouldn't get you for your links, and your cash and your minks
Savage enough to keep my average up
Puttin chumps in assume a new marking then I'm scot free
Watch me, duck into the night with your valuables
I'm getting down with my tools

[Hook 2x]

[Outro: Casual]
Hah, whassup? Tell me we ain't the best now
That's how we do! Ripping shit! Niggas don't know...
They ain't the best, cuz we be
That's practice[Intro]
Are you ready?
Are you ready?

[Chorus]
I get shoppin sprees off the heezy
I get dough to blow, please believe me
Don't want the one on one
Take it easy
You're just the jump-off
I'm his breezy
I'm the one who knows him the best
I'm his one and only, nothin' less
You don't wanna take it there
Don't you see
He told me he loves me
Calls me his breezy

[Verse 1]
Let me break it down, break it down
I got it on lock and
I think you better stop
I heard you been checkin for my boo
Do ya thing, get busy
Give it your best shot
But you couldn't get a call back
And even after all that
Caught you at the mall for a throwback
That's big pimpin' but you
Wouldn't listen, he's mine
Not yours but a fall back

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Now I'mma let ya know to your face
You needa hit the brakes
Your about to make a major mistake
I'm gonna call you out, no doubt
Let me spell it out
Baby you ain't nothin but a fake
Cause I know what you want
And you ain't gotta front
So go ahead and pull another stunt
Remember that it's me that he loves
All he's thinkin of
I'm the only one that he wants

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Cause what we have is so real
It's more than just dollar bills
This livin' lavish
Wouldn't matter if I didn't have his heart
Sorry shorty, he's mine
Better luck next time
But baby if you want it, you can have it
But I'll still be his girl

[Chorus x2][Intro: Kwamé]
This - this is brought to you
By the K-1 Emergency Broadcasting System
In the - in the event of an actual emergency
You will be told to...
Fall out
Fall out
Fall out
Fall out
Fall out

[Method Man]
S.I., rockin' it
N.Y., rockin' it
Shit, we stay poppin' it
4-5, rockin' it
Game, stay on top of it
Lame, just the opposite
It's no thang, when I bring the pain ain't no stopping it (hold on)
Who the fuck is this? About to bring the ruckus
This just ya boy, I'm some on other shit
My nigga, take a puff of this
Piff man, I'm loving this, is Staten Island up in this?
Bitch, like we running it, and somebody wanna public (I'm coming)
Turn it up a bit, so my thugs can thug a bit
If I got my brother get, K, we got another hit
Ladies please, where y'all puffin' them trees?
I'm damaging M.C.'s, oxygen, you can't breathe, fall

[Hook: Method Man (Kwamé)] (2x)
Fall out, yeah, I'm going all out (hold on)
Hold on, man, what's really going on (I'm coming)
And when I'm coming, a hundred miles & running (keep back)
Keep back, y'all ain't got it like that (fall out)

[Method Man]
Here we go again, herb-smoke, blowing in the wind
Cops chasing, wanna throw him in the pen
And the day he leave the game, yo, he going in the Benz
On them 24's looking like he rolling on the rims
All daying, knawimsayin', I'm staying up to par, parleyin'
While y'all hating, I'm splitting this cigar
Man, it's nathan, all y'all do is aim and start spraying
Cuz tonight's the night, and me and my niggas ain't playing (keep back)
Y'all done did it now, another critic kicked Tical
Alotta niggas mad cuz I ain't fold like they figure, now
Let me put my fitted down
*hwak*
Spit around
Listen when this hit the ground, y'all gon' hear the difference now
Here I got that miracle, sickest individual
Flow that's so original, see this is what they meant to do
It's not an act, it's all actual fact
The kid is back, making tracks, catch panic attacks, and fall

[Hook] (2x)

[Method Man]
Aww shit, ain't this about a bitch
I give a fuck about a bitch, I'm more about a grip
And I'm all that a nigga got, the more he gotta get
Feeling like a million dollars, buyin' million dollar shit (keep back)
What y'all dealing with, one shot killing it
Stop changing my style, when y'all stop stealing it
Meth is chillin' like milk top killing
If it ain't got no real in it, I'm probably not feeling it (keep back)
I'm deadin' ya kids, and burn another blizz
What it is, what it is, Wu-Tang is for the kids
So niggas please, why y'all puffin' them trees
I'm damaging M.C.'s, oxygen, they can't breathe, fall

[Hook] (2x)This the year of the BlackSmith
Talib Kweli, Kwame, let's go

Yeah, niggas don't listen
Back in the days we all used to listen
Now shit is so wack, nobody listen
To that real hip hop, yo, listen

[Hook]
Ladies and gentlemen, get ready, here I come
Talib Kweli and I'm bangin' on ya eardrum
Something I wanna tell you
Now lemme get up in it, wait, wait, wait, wait

[Verse 1]
Friends, Romans, Countrymen, lend me ya ears
Stop repentin' cause the ending is near
But don't panic, you can't function if you livin' in fear
Pay attention, you gotta listen to hear
(Wait just a minute), who the fuck you think talkin' to?
Put you on hold, get a specialist to walk you through
Kweli, the flow captain of fast and slow rappin'
I'm so crackin', you ain't heard? Ya shit appear like closed captions
King of the bars and I'm goin' hard, pause
All my confidence comes from knowin' God's Laws
Bangin' on the system, fightin' my kinda war
Loud as a whisper, quiet as a lion's roar

[Hook]
Ladies and gentlemen, get ready, here I come
Talib Kweli and I'm bangin' on ya eardrum
(Something I wanna tell you)
Now lemme get up in it, it's for ya spirit so
But y'all hear me though
Get up, get into it and get involved
There's a little something that I wanna spit for y'all
(Something I wanna tell you)
Now lemme get up in it, wait, wait, wait, wait

[Verse 2]
Get it now, get it fast, get it right
Get it big, get it locked, get it done, get it tight
(I think I wanna feel you)
But you don't really hear me though
I spit clearly so it's live outcha stereo
To your heart while it's beatin' in ya chest
When you speakin' to execs and they see behind the desk
To ya spirit, nothing weaker than the flesh
So while you try to keep it fresh, you gettin' deeper into debt
Real hip hop is missin' from the shelf
Yup, it's what you felt when you listen to yaself
Only a few is makin' cuts that's spinnin'
So before you spend ya hard earned spinach

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You love the sounds comin' out your speaker
I spit rounds like a nine millimeter
The youth today, they frown at the teachers
They ain't down with no leaders
They don't wanna wait (just a minute)
They like, "What? Nigga, wait right there"
I got 'Reservoir Dogs', you'll be missin' a right ear
Get it clear, I figure it's my year
I'm everywhere makin' appearances and niggas might miss
Hear the word, peep the flow, check the cadence
What you heard as a pro, I'm so amazing
Don't front, girl, you know it's ya favorite
New Kweli, yo, they runnin' out of patience

[Hook]

Yo, don't it sound so good to you?
It's the return of the greatest, y'all
Talib Kweli, BKMC
BlackSmith is the movement, BlackSmith is the music
Whatchu ridin' for?
Whatchu livin' for?
Whatchu dyin' for?
(I think I wanna feel you)
Bangin' on ya eardrum, yeah

Wait now, wait now, wait now for a minute
Listen
Wait now, wait now, wait now for a minute[Verse 1]
Tears are diamonds, a pillow of stone
I lay there waiting for you, but you never showed
How did this happen to me, I better shake you off
Cause it ain't like I never felt this way before

[Hook]
Oh love, you ain’t never been good to me
Oh love, you ain’t never been sweet
Tell me why-y-y, why you making a fool of me
Oh love, love, love, love, love
You ain’t never been good

[Verse 2]
You hold me together, then tear me apart at the seam
So inconsistent, you come and you go as you please
Can’t let this happen, I better shake you off
Cause it ain't like I never felt this way before

[Hook]
Oh love, you ain’t never been good to me
Oh love, you ain’t never been sweet
Tell me why-y-y, why you making a fool of me
Oh love, love, love, love, love
You ain’t never been good
You ain’t never been good
You ain’t never been

[Verse 3]
There when I needed you
There when I cried
Asked you for truth and all you gave me was a lie
Oh love, I think I’ve had enough
I’m so tired of running in circles
Believing you’re with me
When all you keep doing is hurtin' me

[Hook]
Oh love, you ain’t never been good to me, no no no no
Oh love, you ain’t never been sweet
Tell me why-y-y, why-y-y-y-y, why you making a fool of me
Oh love, love, love, love, love
You ain’t never been good, no no no, no no-o-oh
You ain’t never been good
You ain’t never been good to me, no no no
You ain’t never been good[Verse 1]
Well I stumbled on a picture kinda made me laugh
A photograph, what brought me right back to the past
When I was a youngster
Quite nerd type, that wanted to be amongst the
Older, bolder, colder crowd
With fat gold chains and strolled around
In tucked silk suits, hundred dollar Bally boots
Hat to a tilt and a felt substitute
Fashions my have seemed to have worked
But it seems I was a fake, and fakes look like jerks
All I could do is scheme
Hoping that one day I'll be on the top of the team
No matter how hard I tried, I'd just collide
With being a fool and an old guy
It didn't work, and that annoyed
And I asked myself why can't I be oneovdabigboiz

[Chorus: Tasha Lambert]
Oneovdabigboiz
One of the big boys
One of the big boys
Oneovdabigboiz
One of the big boys
One of the big boys
Oneovdabigboiz

[Verse 2]
Now I remember one day in the 7th grade
A new girl came to school and I must say
I slid, skid, crashed and got a crush
On her and all other things seemed like a bluff
I wouldn't dare to speak, didn't say a word
Trying to be a big boy, I just became a nerd
Doubting myself, thinking I'm all sissy and all
Either I was too short, too shy, or too small
Which was a sign of ignorance
So I brought up confidence
The next day I'm panicking
Stiff as a mannequin
What do you know
She doesn't even show
But there's tomorrow, the next day she came
Arm and arm with some dude, with some gangster name
Hopes and dreams in a flash were destroyed
All because of the fuss of oneovdabigboiz

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Tasha Lambert]
I'm the one that told you not to worry
You'll grow up to be someone special
Take your time and don't you hurry
Cause soon you will be

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
They all had rides, I only had two feet
They used to pick their girls up but on a train we meet
Why can't I be a big boy I used to ask myself
And self said "Why do you wanna be someone else
Why do you wanna wear what someone else wears
Or get a cut, like someone else's hair
Or be seen in someone else's glare
You know what I'm saying (you're right)" YEAH!
I'll do my own thing speak my own slang
Be in my own swing, know what I'm saying
Cause baby I'm a star
You know who the hell I are
It's paying off a lot
I had everyone rocking the streets and wanting the polka dots
It's OK, this life is I enjoy
And it's cool being Kwame, not oneovdabigboiz

[Chorus][Produced by Kwame, Co-Produced by Eminem]

[Talking]
New York City
You are now rocking with the best
Lloyd Banks
G-Unit

[Hook]
We on fire
Up in here, it's burning hot
We on fire
Shorty take it off if it get to hot, up in this spot
We on fire
Tear the roof off this motherfucker, light the roof on fire
Nigga what you say
We get loose in this motherfucker, light the roof on fire fire fire

[Verse 1]
Now I ain't putting nothing out, I smoke when I wanna
26-inch chrome spokes on the Hummer
This heat gon last for the whole summer
Running your bitch faster then the Road Runner
Rocks on my wrist, rolls gold under
Glocks on my hip, those throw thunder
Im buying diamond by the pier
But when you stop, the only thing still spinning is your ear
Yeah, im riding with that all black snub
Raiders cap back, all black gloves
Im 80s man, but the boy smack thugs
These record sales equal more back rubs
Not to mention I bought a pack of clubs
His impacts about as raw as crack was
Now all these new artists getting raw deals
Im only 21, sitting on mills

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
If you know anything about me, then you know im a baller
If I ain't hit the first night, I ain't gon call her
Im trying to play, you trying to have my daughter
But I can't blame her for what her momma taught her
And I don't care bout what the next nigga bought her
Cause I ain't putting no baguettes in her butter
I got a diamond about as clear as water
And I got bread, but I ain't spend quarters
So cut the games ma, lets go in the back
Matter fact, turn your ass round, back a nigga down
And I ain't bias when im riding through the town
Like em small, like em tall, like em black, like em brown
She gotta be able to come when I need her
Tight ass pants, little wife beater
Regular chick or R&B diva
Bitch say something, I ain't a mind reader

[Hook][Verse 1]
Listen close to the musical member of Mensa
School of Hard Knocks got Tenure
My lectures advance, the Einstein of my time
Stephen Hawking, when I'm chalking my rhymes
E equals MC Squared, Yeah that's true but this MC here
You can't box in
I.Q of Socrates's, Lyrical Doctrine
Philosophies, Methodically written within the conscious
Beautiful mind, R.Crow, Nas Flow, not him, Nostradamus
Some say I'm dreaming, so pinch me
I am Da vinci, over 186,000 miles of quick speed on this beat
Let me enlighten you
Kissinger of Literature, NASA of Rappers
Over your head, Shooting Star out of your reach
Supernova Instead - Hip Hop's Willy Shakes slash Billy Gates
They just Microsoft – small thing to a giant
Possessed by the ghost of Steve Jobs, See iRap
Something like Beethoven, Fur Elise with these bars
A great poet, Langston Hughes, I've paid my dues
Murs could speak, to voucher
Omega Alpha, End of the beginning
Julius Caesar, Nucleus Ether

[Verse 2]
Molecules, phenomenal, combined with the logical thoughts
So astronomical, gotta record on satellites
No LSAT required, but I pulled a 180
No turning back, I learned from past errors
It's all mathematical -- Let me break it down
Divide and Conquer, Underground so I guess I subtract
A.D.D multiplied equals one fact
My intricate, rhymes patterns are infinite
Indicative of scholars, but primitive artist limit is dollars
Makes no sense, in comparison they are no threat
My intel processes faster then your PC's
Musical 3-D,Out of this world you can call me E.T
I Spielberg, When I spill words, I still observe
MC's on MP3's, Telescope Flow
I'm better then ever those
Rappers that bloggers forever pose
But never ever will blow
Except in the offices
They are all soft as shit, from babies orifices
But ya'll down get it
In a different time zone, with my poems
Light bulb over head call it Edison
Ya'll sick I got the medicine
And I'm a motherfucken VeteranLadies and gentlemen
The Kit-Kat Club is proud to present
Something new, something different
So would you please give a warm welcome to
The Rhythm

Well I came here for something funky to happen
Is this Christmas cuz everybody's rappin
You better get sparked by the song that I sing
Although my name ain't Martin Luther
But I'm considered the king
Yo, my beats pumped by the mic I clamp
I don't need an amplifier
My brain is the amp
I got the beats to make you tingle
Make your body mingle
Like you got the fever for the flavor of a Pringle
Weak I say not so
I'm just like Picasso
A pioneer
I am here
Ask me how I got so fly
Any sense that I can give 'em
A New Beginning Stevie-o
And my dope rythm
I sent the Lord master give a mental harm
My sole chief belief is that Islam
My beats pumped
So let it grab ya
I got a trick but my name ain't Ali-Baba
So open Sesame
Neva' heard the best of me
Betcha all the people intheplaceiswacknowlet'ssee

And if you didn't know I could tell you that I'm a
Mellow cool brotha
Slicker than oil

Rhymes like the thunderbolts of the mighty Thor
Be goin' wit' yourself

Smooth, suave, savoir faire, debonair
Come in the party yeah I see you stop and stare
To hear the man to only have yo hand shook
You dress GQ to me you got The Jordache Look
Cuz I'm the mystical
Rap is polyphystical
Ask about Kwame
Hey say he is a cool fella
He's always mellow
He's neva high-stung spark
When the mic is near him
It cleva I run smooth like Moet
Recite just like a poet
Ain't my slam oh yeah I know it
Cuz when I'm on the mic while boys say oh golly
Slick on my tip like the hip on Polygrip
I go cameo be on the Grammy show
I be sleek as a sheik I'll freak any ho
In the panty hose pumping clothes
Yo my rhymes slam well I suppose cuz
I'm might meander Hmm... throw a shenanigan
To write a fresh rhyme you know I can again
Cuz I destroy bust 'em like a hemorrhoid
Strong like a steroid avoid the Noid
The Rhythm

The black can take a rap the M A X
And as I step in the party that's when they ask
For me to get on strong no fear like a gladiator
Turn on steam up MCs like a radiator
Play 'em all out executioner style
Speak my peace just release refusing to smile
This is serious though I rap a little humor
But still MCs I hear assume I could neva
Bust a fat rap twice
And at that price
On any mic you gave me I got nice
I push a pull up a sit up get up I'm fed up
Shut ya lip up and let's go head up
Poisonous as venom no mistakes in 'em
Gucci on silk you got Vasco in denim
No my name ain't Taco, Emilio or Paco
But Kwame boy and I got yo
Chick on the side cuz she sweatin' my tip
Gave a peck on the neck just to wetten my lip
I don't drop my pants for no Raggedy Anns
Just to pass up a chance on a kids romance
I should have blown this mic
Like I said I might
Got the force of 20 men like a Jedi knight
And
It's kinda hard for me not to do it slow
So
I gotta go
The RhythmUhh, hot, fire, hot, uhh

[Chorus]
L!!!  Who bring you the hotness?
L!!!  Yo, you don't wanna start with
L!!!  Forever keepin it locked
It's now time to rock with - L!!! - throw your L's up

[LL Cool J]
Don't ever underestimate the Jack the Ripper
Be clear, every time he reappears, it's sicker
Listen here, the mind expanded, the vision is slicker
I'm long range like a miss-ile, many styles to getcha
Tear ya out the frame so the hood can get the picture
But I'd rather break bread, kick knowledge and get some money witcha
I'm willin and able, to smooth pounds out like Witch Hazel
The legend is real, I'm not a fable
Captivated the screen, I'm Queens' Clark Gable
If it ain't a joint, bet your label, don't put it on the table
I'm out for the moolah, throw better hooks than David Tua
Who's the nicest?  (L, YOU ARE!!)

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[LL Cool J]
You don't want it with L, b'ship cats'll get banged out
Put your flow throw a filter boy - shake the old slang out
23's in the building, watch my tongue hang out
Makin MC's scatter like multiple shots rang out
Day one since I came out, they can't put the flame out
My temp seizin, perfect reason to blow the game out
Skatin off in the Navi, naw baby you can't have me
But I know cats will pay for that 'n lace ya - yeah, gladly
Warning, young rappers, you don't want a career?
Y'all wanna keep goin platinum, y'all don't wanna disappear?
Stop boppin backstage like you causin me fear
Cause you startin to get on my nerves, and that's a problem
The vet's in here

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[LL Cool J]
Tension on the mic, halftime highlights
L Boogie bangin on 'em, jumpin through the skylight
You stand corrected, I'm hot, so get it riddight
I'm just spittin, when the middick is gripped, I spit it tiddight
Aight?  Oh, these various rappers is so hilarious
Who put the mic down but y'all ain't qualified to carry this
Your, tracks are garbage and bars are miscellaneous
So, throwin your joint at my car was spontaneous
Oh!  I can't take it, why, must they fake it
Flows is fully dressed, yours is butt naked
Forever I will be, the one they came to see
Blowin mics in half baby, who else could it be but

[Chorus] - repeat 4X

[LL Cool J]
Uhh, I'm so hot (yeah)
We so hot (yeah)
Uhh, uhh, you so hot (I'm so hot)
Uhh, uhh, feel it hot (yeah)
Uhh, uhh, are you hot (you make me hot)
Uhh, uhh, I know I'm hot (oooh)
Uhh, uhh, are you hot (yes I'm hot)
Uhh, uhh, I know I'm hot - feel it! (yeah)[Chorus: Kwame](2x)
Just as fast as it come it can go
Flyin' high, money right, unstoppable
Just as fast as it come it can go
Young and free, honestly, untouchable

Vizzy, Kwame

[Verse 1: XV]
Look up, look up I'm fly though
Came from the underground like a silo
Chick on my side where I go
Jeans got a brand new stitch, no Lilo
I go everywhere y'all don't
Ya'll won't read the manual, I'm an Autobot
Get in then it auto lock
Or get son'd like I called your pops
Livin' for the life that I'm living in my rhymes
So I'm getting in a rid where the limit is the sky
I'm unstoppabbe, Hoff'll flow like water with a lemon on the side
Flight attendant said put your seat up
Stewardess told me kick my feet up
Fly up and I'm up
Unstoppable and I hope y'all see us

[Chorus: Kwame](2x)

[Verse 2: XV]
I'm at the end of the level
You at the screen trying to cheat when you enter codes
And the kid's so cold it's visible
Knock it out the park and they all screaming "send us home"
So I'm home like street lights when dinners warm
Middle of the map on the center fold, we on
V-I, double Z, Y in the zone, he fly, then he gone
He write when he wrong and I'm
Looking down on my city from the air
Funny how the whole world look like squares
And I was that, now I came back
Where I'm at like boots, you can ask'em that
In the sky like an astronat
Or an astronaut with an Astro hat
I'm a star with it
Came in a space ship, now I'm gone in it

[Chorus: Kwame](2x)

[Verse 3: XV]
They all wonder where he going
There he go when the night start slowing down(4x)
See me around those stars that glowing
All I'm knowing
Is that sky can't hold a nigga like I back
And the cameras on me, you know I chat
Flying high, my niggas know I'm that
They sending postcards [?], when I'm so far
Wiz kid made it out of Oz
This is from a grind so hard
You got no signal, that's no bars
But that's your fault, I got it in
This my song, pop it in
Now we gone like the wind
Flyin' high till the end

[Chorus: Kwame](2x)Intro:

What should I do
Should I just write you
Or tell you how I feel
Because my love is for real
What should I do, what should I say
Hmm I know a way
When I meet her I'll greet her like this

Verse One: (girl's voice in parenthesis)

Hello (hello), how do you do (well I'm fine)
You busy (no why?), cause there's something on my mind
You know that we've been knowing each other for a long time
And I came to the conclusion that I want you to be mine
(Why?)  why?  (Yes why?)  why not
Don't you see that's it quite obvious I care for you a lot
(So do I) so you do
So what's the problem dear (Kwame I don't trust you)

Chorus:

Hai Luv
Can, can, can I have a word with you
I'd like to tell you, tell you all of the things I'm going through
My  nights been so long, so long, as I watch each hour go by
And I'm standing here, hoping and praying that you'll let me be your guy

Verse Two:

(Now out of all of the girls you've had how do I know that I'm not next?)
Cause all they could do for me, is gimme some quick, well umm (oh)
Just listen OK?
(OK, OK, OK)
It's not an egotistical thing, I'd give my heart to you
For yours to keep, if you wanted to
Cause you're the only one, the only one made for me
Love had me so blind I find that I can't see
Pain heartache
I just want to partake in acts of love
(singing)  We are breaking away from pain here's joy
Together we're man and woman, not girl and boy
Taste sweet chocolate like an Almond Joy
Play with each other like a brand new toy, yoy, yoy

Chorus

With this cold hear, you are dearly, yeah ya know?

I wish you were my lover
You act so undercover
I went through trial my whole life long
Be it right or be it wrong (be it wrong)
I only want to make you crazy
Girl don't front don't be so lazy
Just want your mind don't want your money
These two words they may sound funny
But oh ooh oh you're my sweet thang
You're my everythang (2X)

Outro:

Tic-toc you don't stop
Young ladies, of the '80s (you mean '90s) go crazy[Verse 1]
Made in America, where ya
Placed on the totem pole
I got soul
Cause I'm a black man
Never sellin' crack and
Track the police
The facts I release
Go straight through your ear to the mind
Listen, just cause this man is white I won't dis him
I'll enlist him
Work with the system
It's a big country
Ain't nobody's flunky

Be cool, don't lose control
Cause a fool will scold someone else before himself
There ain't no need to be hurt
Proceed to be alert
The seed is in the dirt
When you ain't got nowhere else to look you're gonna find 'em there
And the time you shared
Time together
Maybe climb together
But if it don't work out
Still don't doubt or pout
It's out in the open
Hopin' that it ain't scarin' ya
This is made in America

[Hook]
Made in America
Made where? Made in America
Made where? Made in America
Where dat at? Made in America

[Verse 2]
I'mma have it made in America
Paid in America
Bring about a raid in your area
Who's controllin' who?
You controllon' you
Don't let noone tell you what to do
You your own person
I be thirstin' for more information to deal with the nation
Be forewarned
The more informed you are will help you swarm the farther regions
So please begin
Ask your elders
I'm sure they'll tell ya

Where ya came from
If ya brain's numb
From wonderin'
Where did ya come from then
Ask your moms to drop the bomb
Just remember black is black
No matter the shade
Just be glad that she gave birth to you
It might hurt ya to
But you gotta wonderful life
So take it light, yo
Racial tensions
Makes ya fist tense
It's a cinch when
You don't get alarmed
I'm strong and mighty
Just politely preparin' ya
If ya made in America
Cause then they always fearin'
Ya need a strong foundation
When ya placin' stationed in America

[Hook x2]

Yeah, we got the funk
We got the funk
We got the funk
We got the funk[Verse: 1]
Let's call it a stick up, let's call it a show down
Miss Money Mae came to shut it down
Everybody on your feet when the beat drop
Let me see the girls take the booty down
I'm up in this thing, I'm all classy shit
Ice top glass with my champagne poured in it
Two sips, booty shaking my hips
To the rhythm of the beat, let's go baby
It's getting hot under the spotlight
We in this club paint house dressed in white
Like Diddy, baby can you dig it?
This is how we do it when we come to your city

[Hook]
They call me
Miss Money, Money, Money Mae
Miss Money, Money, Money Mae
Can I drive your car, can I hold that cash
Drop a couple stacks in my hand
Miss Money, Money, Money Mae
Miss Money, Money, Money Mae
Can I drive your car, can I hold that cash
Drop a couple stacks in my hand

[Verse: 2]
Let's call it a robbery cause I came to take shit
Bet 'em big boys, yeah, that's my target
They call me a killer back in Jersey
The way I murder on the track real dirty, real gangsta
I see you bopping to the beat and I thank ya
Put your hands up, let me see you wave 'em
We got it looking like a hostage situation

[Hook]

[Verse: 3]
Let's slow it down right here while I catch my breath and breathe
I got my eye on big boy across the room and I can feel him watching me
Usually I call the shots but I can tell he packing heat
I need a boss that can help me set this off
Come on, let's get this money

[Hook](Yeah, new shit)

[Verse 1:]
I got plans for you and me
We both need to move on
Cause you ain't what i need
It took some time for me to find out

I didn't sign up for misery
And no, we can't work it out
Things ain't the same way
That they used to be
Cause you don't feel for me no more

[Chorus:]
I got some new clothes
New kicks
I got a new crib
New whip
All your drama
I don't miss
I'm so over you, boy
I'm on some new shit

I can't believe I was with you
All the pain that I went through
I sing a new song
New hit
I'm so over you, boy
I'm on some new shit

[Verse 2:]
Now, boy
Don't start blowing up my phone
I thought I told you to be gone
(Be gone)
Had the chance to make things right
But you kept doing me wrong

This ain't a break-up to make-up game
I'mma do you how you did me
Cause this is a new day
New change
New me
I'm moving on to some new shit

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Now that I know
He ain't the one for me
Now I know this
Now I know this
Now I know this
So tell me
Would it

Tell me
Would it make sense for me not to leave
You know I'm already going
I guess it's time to move on

[Repeat Chorus:]

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(I'm on some new shit)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(I'm on some new shit)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(I'm on some new shit)

I'm so over you, boy
I'm on some new shit
I'm so over you, boy
I'm on some new shit
