[Intro: Taco]
Yo, shout out to everybody that worked on the album, you feel me, son?
Yo, shouts out to Ty Dollas
Shouts out to Hodgy Daddies, shouts out to Left Brizzle
Shouts out to Domyen, shouts out to Frankie Ocean
Shouts out to Syd the Dude, shouts out to L-Boy Awwwwk

[Verse 1: Tyler the Creator]
The big eared bandit is tossin' all his manners
In a bag and wrappin' them in Saran wrap bandages
Tossin' 'em in baskets with the rest of those sandwiches
So when he says "Catch up, nigga" it looks like an accident
Um, flowin' like my pad is the maxiest
My bitch white and black like she's been mimickin' a panda
It's the dark skinned nigga, kissin' bitches in Canada
Then kicking all out like Mr. Lawrence did Pamela
Put her in the chamber all against her Wilt Chamberlain
I never had a Reason, nigga I was just Ableton
Not a fuckin' Logic contradictin' dick head
Flyer than an ostrich moshin' in a tar pit
Semen scented cheetah printed tee
In that 'Preme five panel, I'll repeat it for the season
Previous items in the present
With the normal ass past like I cheated on my team
It's me (Tried to get that nigga, but, Golf Wang)

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
To have some type of knowledge that is one perception
But knowin' you own your opponent is a defeatin' bonus
I'm Zeus to a Kronos, cartilage cartridge is boneless
Smiles of cowards in lead showers, dead spouses in red blouses
Children who fled houses on Mustang horses and went joustin'
I'm on my Robin Hood shit, robbing in the hood
Whips, drugs, jewels, and your pet, I'm stealin' your rims
Coke diamonds and your Vette, soldiers lace the fuckin' boot
And salute like the troop when they shoot you gon' brrrooop
It's KILLHodgy, nigga, stay the fuck off my stoop
And out my Kool aid, Juice

[Verse 3: Left Brain]
Hodgy got the juice, I got the gin
Jasper got the Henny, my nigga we get it in
Wolf Gang party at the hotel
I call a ho, you call a ho, and all the hoes tell
You know Left Brain need a freak
I need a bitch to go down like a Nitty beat
Yup, uh, and her ass fat
Don't be surprised if I ask where the hash at
Nigga I'm tryna smoke, bitch get higher
Domo where that Flocka Flame? Talking 'bout a lighter
Still bang salute me or just shoot me
Cause if you don't salute me then my team will do the shooting
Yeah my nigga Ace will pull the black jack
The king Mike G is in the cut with the black mac
We like the mafia, bitch, don't get to slacking up
And if these haters acting up, throw 'em in the aqueduct
Free my nigga Earl, yo, I don't really ask for much
But two bad bitches in front of me cunnilingus

[Verse 4: Mike G]
What the fuck is caution?
Often I leave 'em flossing in KAWS, exes next to coffins
Lost in translation, the dreams you chase
Got you diving for the plates like you stealing home base
That's great, I'm home alone dreaming of two on ones
With Rihanna and Christina Milian, bring it on
And Travis is in the closet organizing and hanging the tramp
Three lettermans that Ace has been making him
No strays while we catching matinees, huh?
I'm getting blazed thinking 'bout those days
I had the top off the GT3 like toupees
One finger in the air, all's fair when crime pays
My grand scheme of things is to be attached
To the game like bitches to their wedding rings
And you don't even need to look cause we gleam obscene
In the light, ride slow to my yellow diamond shining
Like the Batman logo over Gotham, rock LA to Harlem
If you say "Get 'em Mike G" then I got 'em
One man squadron, nigga I'm a problem
From Briggs I got bars and plans to
Pimp these Polish bitches into pop stars
Humanity kills, we all suffer from insanity still
And if I said it then it is or it's gonna be real
OF 'til I OD and I probably will, uh

[Verse 5: Domo Genesis]
It's still Mr. Smoke-a-Lotta-Pot, get your baby mommy popped
With my other snobby bop, do I love her? Prolly not
Know your shit is not as hot as anything I fuckin' drop
Bitch I'm in the zone, stand alone, like Macaulay Cock
I've been runnin' blocks since a snotty tot
Big wheel was a big deal with the water Glocks
Now I'm all grown, same song, just a different waltz
Fire what I talk, but still cooler than an Otter Pop
Op, Dom next shit in your wish list
Mad sick shit, mad dick for your bitches
On some slick shit, your mistress on my hit list
And I'm lifted 'til I'm stiff outta this bitch
Odd in your mothafuckin' area
Blood clots give me five feet 'fore I bury ya
Suicide flow, let the big wave carry ya
Tyler got the mask like he held Jim Carrey up
And fuck your team, ho nigga wassup
Wolf Gang so you know we not giving no fucks
You know me dog, I'm a chill in the cut so I can
Cut it short, break it down, couple pounds, roll it up

[Interlude]
Get me a Persian rug where the center looks like Galaga

[Verse 6: Frank Ocean]
Rent a super car for a day
Drive around with your friends, smoke a gram of that haze
Bro, easy on the ounce, that's a lot for a day
But just enough for a week, my nigga what can I say
I'm hi and I'm bi, wait I mean I'm straight
I'mma give you this wine, the runner just brought the grapes
My brother give it some time, Morris, and Day
Course you know the vibe's as fly as the rhymes
On the song, cut and you could sample the feel
Headphone bleed, make this shit sound real
Used to work the grill, Fatburger and fries
Then I made a mil and them psychics was liars
Now, how many fucking crystal balls can I buy and own
Humble old me had to flex for the folks
Down in Muscle Beach pumping iron and bone
Bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Yeah, bumping oldies off my cellular phone

[Interlude: Jasper Dolphin]
Goddammit, this rapping is stupid and it's hard
Gotta do it over and over and over again but here it go

[Verse 7: Jasper Dolphin]
Hey it's Jasper, not even a rapper
Only on this beat to make my racks grow faster
Got a TV show, so I guess I'm an actor
Pot head, half baked, lookin' like Chappelle
Rollin' up a blunt with that fire from hell
Still ignorant, still hit a bitch
Wolf Gang, nigga, so I still don't give a shit
Catch me in the back with Miley on my lap
Bong rips as I feel on that little bitch cat

[Interlude]
Hah, nigga came through with a 9 bar real quick
Just for the bitches, little bit of money in my pocket
Fuck it, Wolf Gang (Yeah, fuck that)

[Verse 8: Earl Sweatshirt]
Look, for contrast, here's a pair of lips
Swallowin' sarapin and settin' fire to sheriff's whips
(Whoops, whoops!) fuckin' All-American terrorist
Crushin' rapper larynx to feed 'em a fuckin' carrot stick
And me? I just spent a year Ferrisin'
And lost a little sanity to show you what hysterics is
Spit til' the lips meet the bottom of a barrel, so that sterile piss
Flow remind these niggas where embarrassed is
Narrow, tight line, might impair him since
I made it back to Fahrenheit, grimey get dinero type
Feral, fuckin'-ill-apparel-wearin' pack of parasites
Threw his own youth off the roof after paradise
La di da di, back in here to fuck the party up
Raidin' fridges, tippin' over vases with a tommy gun
Never dollars, poppa make it rain hockey pucks
And 60 day chips from fuckin' awesome anonymous
Call him bloated 'til he show 'em that the flow deluxe
Off the wall loafers, Four Loko and a cobra clutch
Vocals bold and rough, evoke a ho to pose as drum
And let me hit and beat it with a stick until the hole is numb
The culprit of the potent punch
Scoldin' hot as dunkin' scrotum in a Folgers cup
Or Nevada, drivin' drunk inside a stolen truck
Shittin' like his colon bust
Belly full of chicken and a fifth of old petroleum
Supernova, I'm rollin' over the novices
And roamin' through the forest and spittin' cold as his porridge is
Stay gold 'til the case closed and the story end
Post mortem porkin' this rap shit and record it
To escort it to the morgue again, lord of lips
Bored of this, forklift the tippy top, best under 40 list
Stormin' the gate, ensurin' the bass
Scorchin', leave these motherfuckers sore in torso and face
Get at me, we savages, half a pack of Apache
Indian pack of niggas who don't give a fuck if we nasty as flatulence
As a matter of fact, your swagger is tacky
So see me you can't like Crunchy Black catchin' a taxi
Uh, back like lateral passin'
With that mothafuckin' gladiator manner of rappin'
As an addict I let Percocet and Xannies relax me
Fall back if your paddies is Maxi, please

[Verse 9: Tyler the Creator]
OF, shit, that's all I got
From my bigger brother Frankie to my little brother Tac
From that father figure Clancy to that skatey nigga Nak
Shreddin' down 'Fax, Wolf Gang run the fuckin' block
Storefront, knee tat
Book cover is the same lettering on lettermans and cotton socks
And grip tape...and my shoes
Um, I was 15 when I first drew that donut
5 years later, for our label yea we own it
I started an empire, I ain't even old enough
To drink a fucking beer, I'm tipsy off this soda pop
This is for the nigga in the suburbs
And the white kids with nigga friends who say the n-word
And the ones that got called weird, fag, bitch, nerd
Cause you was into jazz, kitty cats, and Steven Spielberg
They say we ain't actin' right
Always try to turn our fuckin' color into black and white
But they'll never change 'em, never understand 'em
Radical's my anthem, turn my fucking amps up
So instead of critiquing and bitchin', bein' mad as fuck
Just admit, not only are we talented, we're rad as fuck, bitches

[Outro]
OFM, banging on your FM
Gnaw, 2011, yeah, Golf Wang[Intro: Nakel]
Sawed-off I eat those
These clothes they free, though
Straight from the back of the Supreme store
Don't give a fuck about these hoes but

[Tyler]
Hold on, run that shit back

I want the black kids to like me for this one, man

[Lee Spielman]
Trash Wang

(Screaming throughout the whole song)

[Verse 1: Nakel]
Bitch I'm with the fucking extras
Big dog, cup full of egg nog
Don't give a fuck 'bout shit but clips and
Camp Flog Gnaw
Sawed-Off I eat those
These clothes they free, though
Straight from the back of the Supreme store
Don't give a fuck about these hoes but
Just slob knob in New York shows
Thirsty for the clips till I'm not flow
Pusha Georgia trip, bitch I got it poppin'
Me and Jasper going coffin shopping
Hoes see the board be a lotta boxes
Bitches see the boy and they mouth be frothing
Chain is glossing
Bitch

[Hook]
Trash Wang niggas
Thriller, we the killer
You can tell I'm Golf Wangin'
By the fucking stickers
OF or Wolf Gang
My niggas is my niggas
Don't let them skateboards fool you
Know niggas that pull triggers

[Refrain x2]
Trash Wang, nigga, that's what's up
Trash Wang, nigga, that's what's up
Trash Wang, nigga, that's what's up
Trash Wang, nigga, roll a blunt

[Verse 2: Tyler the Creator]
Wolf Gang, Golf Wang, yeah, them niggas is swell
Tighter than a straight nigga going to jail
Locked in a box, nigga, off them socks
I can finally afford the bail
My bitch isn't bad
She's pretty normal looking with a real nice ass
Now hop off my dick, what it be
Bitch, Mob, Task, Force, Lil, B, nigga
Speaking of the devil
Y'all niggas cornier than kettle
Y'all couldn't smoke crack or heroin
In a Black Ops plane and reach my level
Ate some bugs and I made some carats
Fuck y'all niggas' bullshit, y'all cherish
I'm 21, I threw a party but…
Difference is, y'all didn't have a Ferris
Wheel

[Verse 3: Jasper]
55 grams in that blunt, nigga
I face that
Just copped that motherfucker bimmer nigga
I race that
Keep talking that shit
I'll pull your card
Get chipped like that nigga from Stomp The Yard
Don't fuck with Jasper
He a retard
Kill your motherfucking grandma and have your family scarred

[Verse 4: Tyler the Creator]
Might fuck around and be a goat named Felicia
Sorry, got a little excited
It's probably all the meth Walt Jr. provided
Wolf Gang, up in this bitch
Red Riding Hood is pissed
Somebody tell Megan and Sara to come and suck a-

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Taco]
Beamers for days
White bitches is slaves
Niggas ain't with that warfare
My goons got aim
100 racks before 18
200 before I hit 6 feet
Nigga we bout it bout it
Yo bitch try to suck my dick

[Verse 6: Lucas]
Holding up my chain
Versace Flocka Flame
Pull up in the tank
Cock back and aim (ouch)
Spitting my verse wearing gold fangs
I'm loading up the nine shouting Golf Wang
Your bitch tattoo

Paying all these ratchet's
Phone bills

[Interlude: L-Boy]

[Outro: Tyler]
Odd Future Wolf Gang bruh we Kill 'Em All
Golf Wang sticker on that Trash Wang
Nigga knows that OF popping -- Loiter Squad, Flog Gnaw
OFWGKTA yeah you niggas know them seven letters long
Yeah, Wolf Gang up in this bitch
Golf Wang up in this bitch
Litter Life up in this bitch
OFM, banging on your motherfuckin' FM
Nigga, fuck you thought this was, nigga?
Haha
Click-click (gunshot)
What the fuck was that[Intro: Hodgy]
I fucked this flow

[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
This is my electronic press kit, I hot as some fresh shit
Nigga recollect bitch, grow grey hairs, don't stress it
I text message, messages to fuckin' estrogen
She lets me in, I sex her then she sexier than my leather vans
Cause I never am purchasing, reimbursing your courtesy
Put your body on the curb to work the street, I hearse the streets
Heard she sweet, she Hershey's sweet but me I'm extravagant
Hop on the bandwagon kid, I'm about to tell you some tragic shit
The love is lost and the drugs they cost, in the studio mixing raw
Bitches shit in my drawers like you piss in my drawers
Nigga my dick's in her jaw
I'm Wes Snipes with lead pipes, don't dabble with the apple
Cause a swagga like mine turn them apples into Snapple
Fuck the pick of the raffle, king of the castle
Nigga, Genghis Khan mansion, we the Marilyn Manson
Making money in the present, it be safe for my grandsons
African drums for when the champ come, bitch

[Verse 2: Domo Genesis]
Suicide watch nigga, kill yourself
Opposition who? Nigga reveal yourself
How you steal our swag and figure you still yourself?
Splinter Cell creeping in this bitch, you couldn't feel the stealth
Wolves are prowling, hunger at its fucking best
I'm a beast like the gorilla head that is on my chest
Please let me flex, I'm going off I need some fuckin' bread
Drugs are green, my bitches white and tonight I need fuckin' head
Excuse our swag, I'm tryna tone it down like Jenny Craig
Fresh to death then I guess we looking like the living dead
Oh shit, yo bitch, look at how I'm doing you
Bitches on my dick but look at me I'm fucking beautiful
Niggas tryna figure out, but all I hear in my interviews
Is why this so cool? You niggas are so unusual
Wolf Gang, point me to a nigga I should prove it to
Under pressure, we just stand in the middle like hula hoops

[Bridge: Hodgy Beats]
The fortress is fortified (bitch)
Money in my pockets like I'm 45, Hodgy Beats recording live
Bitch I be surely high and I don't need wings to fly
I'm the air with the pigs, Left Brain, Domo Genesis

[Verse 3: Tyler the Creator]
Knock-knock, who's there? It's me
Your girlfriend had a really nice meeting with my dick (What?)
I killed that pussy and grabbed that knife
Now I got real authentic cheetah print shit (Nigga, you're a liar)
Nigga don't believe me, kiss your lady
And boy, you're gonna get them heebie jeebies?
Nigga my dick stay way disease-y, I make it look easy
51-50, I'm off the Heezy, you ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy?
(5 albums, 100 songs, and you ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy?
I bet you got some J-Kwon, you ain't got no fuckin Yeezy?)
Came in the game like Speedy Gonzalez, I'm fuckin' Looney
See these girls talkin' all that shit (What?)
I'm just tryna see some tits (What?)
Let's get it poppin' like, MC Lyte, around some dykes
I'm, out this bitch like hocus pocus
And me and Lucas got a couple of pickles
And met up with bitches, gave 'em cum on their dimples
Then my dick went limp so, took about 3 pills of Extenzo
Now my dick's longer than a 5 door limo
Harder than a soft right hook from kimbo on PCP and cilantro
When I'm with your bitch I'm like, "Where my dick go?"
Now she think I'm 'bout to eat her whole
Enchilada, I gotta lotta that 'Preme and I'm paying nada
It seems that I'm product placement but I'm not I'm just fuckin' awesome
Yo mama look like a ugly (Fuck you) loser[Produced by: Left Brain]

[Intro]
*cough*
Fuck, yo I gotta stop smoking backwoods

[Verse]
"How you doing? And what's your motive, ho?"
I only trust these bitches bout as far as I can throw em
Trying to pay my momma rent, figure that's just what I owe her
I been trouble since I tumbled out that stroller
Strollin, easy down this narrow path, beefin' with your scary ass
'Preme got my little niggas cheesing off the cherry ad
And nigga, that's a great lunch
Poppa swamp and stomping with the skate fucks
Heavy handing tracks until the day the fucking train come
Raised up, where every mouth that speak the truth get taped shut
Peep the evening news, my nigga, we don't do the same stuff
Kiwis couldn't take us, boy, I'm jogging around these bases
Niggas pitches need to change, I separated from my main one
It's just another day, another nigga's bitch to face fuck
I been like this since the Motorola Razr
What a bastard that baby was
Little mad nigga missing dad, never praying much
Right around the same time his grandmama drank a bunch
Take the bus, take a niggas seat like it was made for me
I got this nigga Da$h with me, he sipping on some maple leaf
I'm only happy when there's static in the air
Cause the fair weather fake to me
Living in the scope, hairs crossed like adjacent streets
Dare a nigga think it's sweet, never, bitches funny boy
You berries and you honey for the bear that's here to tear and eat
Run a niggas pockets like some errands, make it hasty
I hope the sheriff keep away from me[Hook]
All the bad bitches boo when you rap
I can teach you how to pull 'em like a tutor, in fact
I got one in the front and two in the back
And the bitches keep screaming "Odd Future is back"

[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
Wolf with a T-Rex cock, less talk
While I invest stock in wet rock
Smoke with all the big bitches bumping "Bedrock"
Sub in the trunk, thumping up against the dead cops
And pop it like I tossed a match in the engine
And go harder than a fucking crack intervention
Clown of the class and the last to attend it
Big Earl make you fags stand at attention
Odd Future, I'm your motherfucking general
Catch 'em where them slap, slash, stab bitch ass niggas go
Girl, you ain't even gotta ask cause you finna know
Why this Playboy so sticky in this centerfold
Sticky what my niggas blow, icky Earl finish foes
Hit 'em low, riddle them with Chronicles of Riddick bows
Chronic in the spliff to the dome, got my system slow
So I'm walking out, ask them niggas what they sprinting fo'

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Vince Staples]
Black Ted Bundy sick as John Gacy
Chilling with a possible victim, she was 18
A hitchhiker hippie whore, met her at the liquor store
She frequented to help support the habit picked up in the fourth
Grade A piece of ass, so I plan on screwing it
Slipped of a couple Rufilin inside the bitch's juice and gin
Next thing you know, we're on Earl's burgundy carpet
She's kicking and screaming, begging for me to fucking stop it
Look, you know it's not rape if you like it, bitch
So sit down like a pretty ho and don't fight the shit
Or else I'll have to tie a pretty bow 'round your bloody neck
Hide the slices from the gashes given with a dull Gillette
Mop the blood up, put the body in the apartment
Stash it where we hide the marijuana and the condoms
"Hey, what's that?" Don't touch it or even fucking look
You are Fantasia and the body bag's a fucking book

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yo Vince, let me tell you 'bout these hoes I met last night
They thought I was cute 'til I asked what that ass like
Damn right, red light, ran right through it
"You don't even have your permit, what the fuck are you doing?"
Maybe if you shut the fuck up, we'd be cruising
And you wouldn't be sitting, boohooing 'bout your bruises
But no, you wanna be Miss Fuck-with-the-Music
I'm zoning on Relapse, she's sliding on Blueprint
Three seconds it takes for her to turn blue
With my hands around her throat, her arms stopped moving
Pulse stops too, in the back, look confused
As I turn to tell them both not to do shit stupid
Red, white, blue lights in the rear-view, shit
Swerved to the shoulder, tell them both no moving
Sit down in the back, cause the windows tinted
As I rolled down mine to forge a new friendship
"Aren't you a little too young to be driving?"
Look Officer, I'm just tryna get home
"Get out the fucking car with your license and registration"
I ain't getting outta shit, you're starting to try my patience
Didn't have backup, I could tell by the Hummingbike
Reached to the glove, grabbed the motherfucking hunting knife
Stabbed him in his neck and hip, threw him in the trunk and dipped
Back to the fucking crib for some tea and crumpets, shit

[Outro]
All the bad bitches boo when you rap
I can teach you how to pull ‘em like a tutor, in fact
A dead one in the front, dead cop in the back
And two live bitches screaming "Odd Future is back"[Intro]
Left Brain, Wolf Haley
Golf Wang, Free Earl, uh

[Verse 1]
Goddamn I love women
Daydream about penis being in 'em
Meet them with a big grin with a Mac-10
Rope, katana, and then I skin 'em
All beige suit made out of white women
With the red lipstick, dancing to John Lennon
With the red splattered jeans made out of blue denim
They can catch me in the spot where the sun don’t shine
Bitch don’t mind me, shake your hiney
The only motherfucking Wolf here that spit venom
You’re a bad bitch with a real good kitten
And I got the appetite of them fat black women
Wolf Gang in this bitch with a bunch of rats with 'em
Lookin' like the holocaust with Supreme hats with 'em
I am tryna get Ms. Piggy by the motherfucking hairs of her chinny chin chin
Umm, what’s that? The cock of a black dude
Mad cause his daughter got the swag of a vacuum (aww, fuck it)
I’ll take her to the back room, dungeon, fighting and punching
And now the slut is under the fucking assumption
That I will be fucking and munching her muffin
Cunt will be bleeding, but that’s not from the time signature of the month, umm

[Hook]
(It’s because) I’m Dracula bitch
Don’t got a problem smacking a bitch
Kidnapping, attacking, with axes and shit
'til I grab them throats and start smacking them shits
(It’s because) I’m Dracula bitch
Don’t got a problem smacking a bitch
Kidnapping, attacking, with axes and shit
'til she decides to take Dracula’s dick

[Verse 2]
Goddamn I love bitches
Especially when they only suck dick and wash dishes
Cook and clean and grant my wishes
And make me and the Wolf Gang sandwitches
Transylvania crypt let's take a, tour
Bitch try getting through that black trap, door
Keep yelling and working them vocal chords
And that’ll be more of a reason that you'll get slapped up, for
Is that Ford trunk's comfy? (Fuck you!) Fuck me? No, fuck Buffy
That little bitch keeps trying to hunt me
Jumping over gates, what the fuck she want from me?
She keeps sending me garlic
How many times I gotta tell her I’m allergic?
(I like your cape) Oh this Bathing Ape cape?
Bitch, I got it for a bargain at the neighborhood Target
Fangs are sharp and I hope you know
That all I really want from you is that throat
I can’t eat pussy cause I might leave cuts
Then there’s blood on my sheets, but that might be a plus
On the channel, a fucking animal, leaking like pairs of candles
Bitch, is it hard to handle? I don’t want a bride, I just want bone marrow

[Hook]

[Outro]
Bite her in her fucking neck, bite her in her fucking neck
Bottom of the fucking lake, bottom of the fucking lake
Call my gang of wolves and bats
It’s a full moon tonight and these hoes ain’t acting right
It’s because I’m Dracula bitch, swag, swag, swag
It's because, Left Brain, Wolf Haley, Free Earl, Golf Wang[Verse 1]
Follow the leader, bad senoritas in two seater's
She loves green, that's money, Mary Jane and margaritas
The way it seems, the streets be looking at me like a teacher
They hounding me, like desperate rappers waiting for a feature
I ain't saying I don't need you, I'm saying let's keep the pace
Should be back at your place, just being patient with your feet up
They say he's so chill, how does he show no stress?
He can't see into the future, how does he know what's next?
Seeing all of these steps that he's taking
You're mistaken if they say we ain't so complex
I'm tryna be in a blue coupe, you can't pronounce the name
With a bad yellow bitch and she's singing Purple Rain, so insane

[Hook]
And people talking down on me, I don't really think they should
They said they could do it better, I don't really think they could
I ain't one for niggas wishes, but I wish a nigga would
This ain't as easy as it looks, I just make it look good

[Verse 2]
If it's politics, we're the presidents so presence serves a purpose
It's obvious that we're evidence, you're paying for a service
And I feel, you always think you're less than what you can be
What does it mean if I think I'm the one these niggas can't see?
Gang mentality, Odd Future is a family
My niggas thrash, I was always anti Plan B
Did I lose you? I know I'm much more than you're used to
Now I got these girls stepping out from their usual
So they tune in, T.I., see I, realize I'm a stand up guy
And these niggas realize they can't stand to see me on TV
So they lose their footing like they were gluttons with diabetes
But fuck the bullshit, I'm just tryna get rich
With my middle fingers up screaming swag me out bitch
Black kid on the corner selling drugs, go figure
Salute them with 21 guns, I'm killing these niggas

Uhh, bitch
Oh, and Free Earl mothafucka

[Hook][Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
I'm a lotta narcotics, flow aquatic atomic
The way I rhyme in Islamic promises, ignorance is common sense
Straining my glottis, fucking hungry hippopotamus
You niggas are in the bottom pit, obnoxiousness
Is what I was raised around as a child
I'd rather chuck up my middle finger than give a bitch a smile
Hostility fertile like my mule and 40 acres
In my Stacy Adam gators, where's that mothafuckin' stapler?

[Interlude]
Uh, you hear that shit?
Ay, run that shit back
Yeah, that shit hot, nigga

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
Hostility fertile like my mule and 40 acres
In my Stacy Adam gators, where's that mothafuckin' stapler?
Good grades on the wall, niggas hate to see me do it major
I’m just a leader of my team and I ain’t afraid to trade ya
Lacing my shoes, we the MellowHype jews
We controlling the crews, drinking Belgium booze
We animals out the zoos, with a fuse abused
Bitches brewing in our stews, on they knees like the pews

[Hook x2]
Sock a buster in his jaw
Fuck the police, break the law
Twist your fingers up, grip your balls
If you ain't got heart you ain't got shit at all

[Bridge x2]
Where your homies at? They'll get fucked up too
Where your grandma at? She'll get fucked up too
Where your bitch at? She'll get fucked up too
Where the roof at? We'll stomp that bitch through

[Interlude]
Here we go negero, I sing figaro, figaro
Chunking up my deuce bigalow, burning bodies in infernos

[Verse 3: Hodgy Beats]
Aww, mothafucka wanna see you shine and I got my gold on
Clancy said I'm late for my flight, well they better hold on
Can't wait 'til I fuckin' buy me a jet, there gon' be some hoes on it
Just blow O's on it, count dough on it
Smoking in the sky, damage the ozone, don't it?
Shit, I'll take a life for my moment's moment
Contract your own sale, fuck a deal, you're in auction
Turn the bass up, give mothafuckas concussions
Rappers nowadays are all phased when it comes to soft shove
If niggas saying your flow weak, you shoulda bought one
You call this brand new, to me it's Santa Cruz
Don't find HB the man to lose, you ain't a bruise
Catch me on MTV or your local channel news
In London recording to Muse, I'm the man at the fuse
I'm fucking crazy, need slavery to behave me
Engraving what I am saying into your mothafuckin' brain and skull

Nigga, it's MellowHype, what, you forgot?
Yeah, Left Brain on the beat

[Hook]
Got a bitch for everyday of the week
Not to mention the runner ups, told them no mentioning me
It go 7,6,5,4,3,2,1, 7,6,5,4,3,2,1
Monday through Sunday, someone new sleeping with me
Long as she keep going strong, make sure I sleep comfortably
It go 7,6,5,4,3,2,1, 7,6,5,4,3

[Verse 1]
She rolling marijuana and she let it all
It's only Wednesday, that's humpday, we finna' get it on
I like them white body woman, think she a little toned
Camera shoot, don't like cameras, mount it and film at home
So many people be calling ya boy, HB just stalling (Oh girl!)
Wake up after sleep to birds and tweet she still all on ya boy
Open my eyes to a pair of tits, bacon and some grits
Got my Thursday coming soon and oh she with the shit
No effort to get it wetter, she hit the split, she hit the splits
I walk around here free balling, play for the Knicks, she give me kiss
Gloss wearing off to the max, our lips, they stick together
Speaking tounge until it splits, until it splits
That weed, I twist like my nose rings, as she's rubbing my plugs
This Tempur-Pedic's the sweetest, she's white as a dove
Baby believe it, you're eager to be here, just say you're in love
Hate be the meat to the cleaver, Jesus she’s about to pull up, Friday

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You can't control a man, can't force him to hold ya hand
She get deep and then we snap like rubber bands, a hunnid bands
Parades of shades and underhands, the storm is now is thundering
You start stuttering, mumbling
Hurry up and buy, thanks, come again
You purchased enough time here, arguing with the cashier
Can't you see that there's a line here, selfish ass
You ain't the only fish in sea with ya' shell fish ass
And I'm selling 'em by the seashore
Where our resigns take a detour
You always mad at something, fuck you gotta be mad at me for?
All the things that I do, this shit just keep me prideful
Shit, now the world should be your rival
I'm the nigga standing right beside you
And everything is temporary, especially in February
Valentine and chocolate cherries, I'm copping 'em voluntarily
I keep my gang tight, rolling downhill, all news bearing
Pick her up and drop her off, but with them heels and gold earrings
I found this bitch, first she was lost
Look at her now, nigga I ain't sharing

[Interlude]

[Hook][Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
It's all me, I'mma kill 'em no problem
110 degrees, watch me sizzle don't bother
Please, Bet you give up to me
Cause, anything left to compete, get cold slaughter
Puffin' the best pot
Fucked in the head lock
Thumb in yo Ex Box, She suck it like Xpac
Son is the next Pac
Naw nigga, I'm the new me
A lot of niggas talking, but that shit don't really move me
Ready or not, I'm in your spot like the Fugees
Shit is real bitch, not that shit you see in the movie
I rumble for the money if I'm willing and able
I rap like I see my last meal on the table
I'm back on my grizzy, wings spread like an angel
Ain't Safe tho, I got a couple cracks in my halo
Pack loud, call that muthafucka Master Chief
Down for my muthafuckas like Master P
If you're looking for the revolution, ask for me
Pass the tree, and watch me Hulk smash the beat
Ask for beef, don't end up as a causality
You rappers weak
You see me, better ask for peace
Couple hundred Wolf niggas that will thrash for me
Now the whole world wanna smoke hash with me
Said bitch, I'm A God, no blasphemy
Now the whole world wanna smoke hash with me

[Bridge: Hodgy Beats]
Blow one in the air
In the air
Blow one in the air
In the air
In the air
In the air
In the air
In the air

[Interlude: Jasper Dolphin]
Bitch ass niggas don't be smoking, nigga
We be smoking hella blunts over here, nigga
OF, Trash Wang, turn up
Fuck everybody nigga
Imma buy everybody from OF AK-47s
Watch us, nigga
(pow, pow, pow)

[Verse 3: Hodgy Beats]
I don't fuck with niggas too fast to speak
All you muthafuckas too fashion week
I be working hard like an athlete
Cry a nigga a flooded river down the saddest creek
Oh, you mad it's me?
You should be glad it's me
Shit, I'm a fucking MC
Your fucking raps are weak
And if you suckas tempt me, I'm pointing out pipsqueaks
Knocking on your fucking door for beats like Memph Bleek
Dear Summer, Dear Summer, I know its hard
And I ain't working in the office
My nigga, my life is awesome
Constantly facing depression since childhood
Life was also surrounded by my morals
My nigga, this karma's corny
And my peoples doing great
And the outcome is greater
Since you niggas talking God
Ain't nobody gonna save ya
I'm your muthafucking savior
Renegade angel like I'm Xavier
Blow one in the air
(I spit in yo face)[Verse 1: Mike G]
Peep game, I come through in every street lane
Roll my wheels more than major stoners do their favorite strain
And the one i'm with can drink until all bottles are drained
With me, she feel like she dancing on the wings of a plane
Things will never be the same, homie my whole home team are household names, and still with so much to gain
My flow is so golden, you can put it in a chain
Aim for more than a name, how you think we live the same
When you not flossin, hardly
I drink Hennessey, she on Bacardi
We don't mind starting problems as long as we start a party
Call your job, tell em to schedule a replacement
Cause these pills will get you so high, they might send you to the matrix
Let's ride, side to side as my eyes arise at Half past nine, watch me like halftime, I mastered this
So slick I could prolly smash your chick
Because of Mike, they put the G in the alphabet

[Hook: Mike G]
Find me riding in a foreign and I don't know where I'm going
And we ain't getting in til ten in the morning
If I'm on it, then she on it, if she got it, then I want it
If you looking to tomorrow, but you living for the moment
Fist pump it, hell yeah
If you bout it, show me something
Rockstar, I'ma keep it going if I see you jumping
Fist pumping, hell yeah
If you bout it, show me something
Rockstar, I'ma keep it going if I see you jumping

[Verse 2: Larry Susan]
Smoking like a rasta in a flying saucer
Mix between Jamey Jasta and Kevin Costner
Eating mushrooms on lasagna pasta, I'm a monster
Illegal funds, that's my foster, keep your posture
Or you'll scratched from the roster, drugs in school lockers
Blondes with big knockers, what's for dinner? Lobster
Smoking blunts in the outfield with Holden Caulfield
On that real kill, making money turn like a windmill
Flip the intel in the rental, back to grinding banging instrumentals
Your girlfriend says hello
She gags so well though, she ate my Larry Jell-O
Oh well, bitch don't kill my mellow, Susan

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mike G]
I love living lavish
When I was young, I'd rock the hat backwards like Ash
Gotta catch all the cash
And I spent it when I had it, thought I was so fly
I forget my flight status every time someone would ask
But that's nothing new if you knew this particular individual
Situation critical, when citizens get uncivil
So stress less, especially if I'm in your concerns
I could repeat myself, they still wouldn't learn
So you may find me riding in a business whip through business districts
Around suits and business men but I don't feel like one of them
And once again, nothing without progression
You feel like screaming to the heavens every time that you win
So fist pump, hell yeah
If you bout it, show me something
For all my brothers and cousins riding down the block busting
For all my sisters, sh-shawty hope you never stop hustling
Haters can stand in the way but we ain't stopping for nothing

[Left Brain]
I feel you, My nigga[Verse]
Dear Lord, forgive me for all my transgressions
I raise hell until it's heaven
True essence, everything to prove, but it's been a movie since dude stepped in
My crew wrecking, we could give a fuck 'bout who's second
Two is not a winner and three nobody remembers
A push it on the table, don't bring your body to dinner
Just trying to get this money, whole touring throughout the Spring
How we cold all summer and sizzle throughout the winter
Goddamnit, I'm a winner
My uncle left a piece behind
A lost nigga, though I'm searching for a piece of mind
I'm taking yours to add on to this piece of mine
I really think ambition should be redefined
How melodic is the physical embodiment
My soul obvious, stay atop the column and body shit
Fearing nothing, concern is moderate
School of hardknocks and this bitch on full scholarship
Fuck it, feel free to hate on me
I just told the fucking world to hold up, wait on me
Understand that it's the same old G
Blaze more tree, burning up such a fire and remain low key
I'm the one, they told me they was waiting for the revolution
And I arrived and on that day they made a resolution
All the worn down hope came to restitution
The game need a saving, and I was blessed to do it
Collecting my respect cause now it's overdoing
I'ma get this motor on the go before my moment's ruined
The old heads say that I'm a golden student
And I just build my troubles into soulful music[Verse 1]
What is life I flip a coin, cops on my tail, girl on my head
This shit annoying
At least it ain't borin',atleast I live in California, where it ain't stormy
At least I ain't hungry or in pain unless I'm recordin'
I'm who they open the door for and tip the doorman, behind the door man this whore is foreign and trust is swarmin'
The sun is proud and warmer than burning houses with dorner
He was in a room on the computer watching pornas
Feds were pressing their sales like they had something on em'
A man against the world the world belongs to no woman
How some are leading by examples criticized by assumptions
I cut out her face and put fires inside the pumpkin

[Verse 2]
The idea of me is great, the result of me otherwise
Opposing losing options, I'd rather choose than decide
Get high and take a ride wake up on the other side
Mary Janes who I rely on when she text me I reply
Metallica royalty luck out on ACDC
Killing em' hardcore for what they say discreetly
Fucking with me is like diving in a pool with concrete feet
Hodgy dont have a mistress for the fact he mistreet beats
Who gave a fuck about us before we were the golf wang
In odd we trust
Nigga fuck wit the golf wang, a knots will bust
When the wolf on the bus howls the spots freed up
Attempt to make me again you can't bot me up
She be shaving my points like what a Mac 3 does
Blowin' Marijuana fast, lightin up the pre-dub
In the back of the truck three 15'' subs

Ain't no point in lying either way we're dying
Why not don't catch me flying over instruments
And hanging to this drawing
I'm down to hang out and take yo bitch hang-gliding
She hang on my dick since everything i say is rotten

[Verse 3]
You could be wrong but be about it, do ya Pilates
And she in a thong, and commonly she tryna surprise me
Leave me alone but when I call be sure that you got me
Lets call the shots from the house, I play the field you can't stop me
In the back when i make a couple mill i'm in shotty
Hodgy chasing them dolla bills you know the feel if you got it
Prolly skatin on rollin wheels and conditioning for the hotties
Im in the lead fighting for a Vince Lombardi, bitch a ring
I shot a sling local bodega
With these chicken say names and these niggas play sega
I see you testing beta tryna recover some data
I know you want what you peep neighbor, HATER!

We the coaches and the playas still these niggas try to play us
You can't approach us and invade us, little homie get your weight up
Hold up, wait up
My nigga turn the bass up
I drink more then an A-cup, and whatever the fucks in a cup
Good Day, I'm bout to roll a J and this is how I'ma stay today
Until the day my organs decay
Karmas a bitch I make her cum and scream my name
So I'm gettin this money then I'ma dip and break away
Rollin spliffs and then honey I need another cold drank, smoke dank
Don't run up on me with your finer swank
Got a goon that'll shoot blank point, but never shoot blanks
I'm a bastard for what I know, I'm from a sperm bank
And the ? was right around the corner like third base
Then we home ? where she carry her mace
Kiss me on my head, tell me outside's a cold place
Nigga I've been on my rap since eight, and I ain't gon stop till Hodgy one of the greats
No charities as my chariot awaits
Smoke till my voice is carryin the bass

Nigga that Wise and LaKid, Wise and LaKid, Shoot my homie over a discussion; ain't that a bitch?
Nigga that Wise and LaKid, Wise and LaKid, said I've seen my big homies and all the shit that they did
Nigga that  Wise and LaKid,  Wise and LaKid, Shoot my best friend over a plate of ribs,  Wise and LaKid

[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
If this the Devil's work, why do I work for myself?
We're both young niggas in training, break off like an ice shell
My big homies explain how we inherit the life of bad health
Hitting clubs, maintaining wages, strip clubs: throw money on stages
We homies, brothers more so nigga, word to my torso
First we hit a lick then count it at grandma's bringing in four loads
Keys don't give accessibility, you're going to need a door code
You can see my mind going, I take off my sombrero
Robbing niggas then we riding through the night like Zorro
It's hot, the feds on patrol; we're the causes of this like Toro
Up my street cred borough, get the D done, cleaning thorough
If we murk somebody, make sure the job is paying plural
Cause my baby-momma pregnant, she's going to need an epidural
That's why I'm losing weight on the block, these fucking rocks spread intramural
Looking at my hands and all this dirt, need a clean shave and a shirt yo
Tucking handguns under Carhartt, front to me you might get hurt, yo

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
I didn't find love at home, so I was out with my homies
Would stick him for his bologna, if one'd get caught they don't know me
Take one for the team and hold it, 40 days and nights like he Moses
Get out and back to the motive, we carried the streets on our shoulders
Tombs and RPG explosives, laundering money through the shop
Hoping the government won't notice if dimes are dropped and nines get popped
Hallow tips burn funeral service, mama wondered what he did to deserve this
Only one life in each person, excursions at Earth's surface
Who am I? I'm an animal, biodegraded tangible
Nigga my cleaning's annual, try me and meet my hammer too
In the projects I ran the school, in the projects push and the pull
We're just objects seraned and cooled and placed in a box
Release a G then arrest him, rotation switching the locks
Probation: report to the cops, has a wrist brace like a stopwatch
Rottweilers in front on the lot, just passed this cutthroat like Ox
Watching Jamaica disappoint me, I'm smoking and pouring scotch[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Bitch
It's the five-nine taper fade; Sideline Laker game
High time save a page; They already know the name
Doms in this bitch I mean it's real shit taking place
Money still the motive and I'm clocking it like Flava Flav

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
Let me take my scarf off five-four-three-two-one bitch
Hodgy bout to barf logs, I be spitting fire campin makin s'mores
My flow be tramping like you whores I'm suicidal fuck the door
I'm and if but and or

[Verse 3: Domo]
Bitch what the fuck is you talking bout if you ain't getting no money huh
Broke niggas is talking loud I swear you niggas is funny bruh
We what the fuck is up 2012 clutch as fuck
Fast lifestyle nigga slow me down double cup

[Verse 4: Hodgy]
Old school visans rhyme ambidextrous
I switch hands five o clock when your bitch lands by six
She will be quicksand better than the next nigga: this man
Pockets swell up like a sick gland killing your whole ambition
Bitch

[Verse 5: Domo]
My hat says high cause that's exactly how I feel bitch
All I need is green grass and gold on my real bitch
Watch me get it nigga I'mma sell it real quick
Hodgy drew the master plan and Domo hit the kill switch

[Verse 6: Hodgy]
I'm young fellow guy peddle by reppin MellowHigh
Girlfriend never settles why? To busy in the meadows high
Out to Dena I'm fresh like I'm out the cleaners
Hardwood like an angry beaver I'm nuts like my fucking t-shirt
Get it?

[Verse 7: Domo]
A phantom you never hand a random rapper eating cannibal
She can't refuse so I let her drink it like it's Danimals
Handsome dude she wanna be with standing by camera crews
I let her snooze and dream cause none of them wishes tangible

[Verse 8: Hodgy]
I'm balling like Benjamin it's all about the Benjamins
That's why people acknowledge me and I ain't even friends with them
Call a ho then stall a ho I'm also dope across the rope
Catch my fade I bang grenades and beat your face 'til it's off your throat

[Verse 9: Domo]
Please shut the fuck up let me put this shit to sleep
The shit he speak got him all antsy like his Christmas week
Silly me, riding with several bitches with slim physiques
And I'm tryna see lights cameras action like Mr. Cheeks

[Verse 10: Hodgy]
Army fatigue Bape boxes for the league
No ghetto barrettes and weaves down to the sleeve for the fees
If packaged she'll be petite know how to roll up my weed
Her doing's doing the deed and she don't really need shit

[Verse 11: Domo]
They asking Domo "where you been?" They feel they got ditched
Just look for the influence I be under that bitch and
It's a headlock when it come to that grip
You ain't never met a motherfucker done in that sick

[Verse 12: Hodgy]
I'm the best thing yet the I'm the best thing next
I bet I'll mess with presets and jet around all these vets
That don't know how to let go; this game is filled with a bunch of grey hair dead souls
Promise 90 retro, ho

[Verse 13: Domo]
Hey y'all get out of he way cause I'm going AWOL
Bitch lay off the gas that they giving your head tank dog
Thinking that you better than me will get you taked off
You either gotta win or go home, bitch it's the playoffs

[Verse 14: Hodgy]
More luxurious that a throwback with no low Jack no driver but it got doormats
Zero to sixty in like 4 flat; you know any nigga that own that
I ain't stuntin' I'm a youngin' me and my niggas we be thuggin'
At our shows that we be bugging groupie loving and we buzzing

[Outro: Both]

[Domo]
So meet me in the trap; it's going down
MellowHigh leaning like the jaw of Bobby Brown

[Hodgy]
Cops arrest me for a DUI prohibition
We don't need you motherfuckers to stop and listen
Golf Wang Bitch[Hook]
I ain't bullshittin (wait)
And I ain't bullshittin (hold up)
(x4)

[Bridge]
You buster ass niggas ain't smokin as much as I am today (smoke)
As I take a puff and walk by you, I blow the kush in your face (smoke)
If you have nothing to do with getting money, then take a step away (smoke)
We got family extended, like clips that are in need of some haze (smoke)

[Verse 1]
Waiting on shorty to come home and give me a swish
So I can put my weed inside of it, and lickity-split
Bitch I roll a fat blunt, the size of chimney's widith
Green like Jiminy Crick, somebody lend me a bic
Killin' flows and blowin' O's is what I like to do, my ritual
Or ritual, bending words ignant pitiful
Reason why niggas ridicule, but fuck em, they ain't nothin
Amsterdam shag in my weed, I'm puffin

[Hook & Bridge]

[Verse 2]
I'm takin syllables and whippin miracles
Fuck a Cheerio, killin cereals, I'm a criminal
Me, despicable you do the minimal, this shit is pivotal
Gotta get it by the principle
Gotta strike it when it's lit, you know
Gotta light it, hit the spliff indo
Been smokin for a decade, it's habitual
Loud individual, I shine like an emerald
But keep it simple though, unless some niggas start trippin ho

[Hook][Verse 1: Syd tha Kyd]
Hey Baby. Where you going?
You look good to me
You look good to be
Walking by yourself
Maybe I can help

[Hook 1: Syd tha Kyd]
I wanna, I wanna
Do you wanna do some cocaine?
I wanna, I wanna
Do you wanna do some cocaine?

[Hook 2: Syd tha Kyd]
Baby just ignore
The consequence
You look like you can use a little confidence
So follow me, just let it be your paradise
And now that you know what this feelings like
You know you can have it for the rest of your life
Just follow me, just follow me

[Verse 2: Left Brain]
She high as fuck up in my truck
Shocked up looking for a bitch to fuck
I'm high on coke, she high on coke
Coast to coast baby float my boat
Got coke to sniff and weed to roast
And no need to boast, let's snort

[Bridge: Syd tha Kyd]
2 in the back, one in the front
Do you wanna ride in my car?

[Break: Syd Tha Kyd]
Ayee
Don't trip
Just try it once
Don't worry (I wanna I wanna)
Just follow me (I wanna I wanna)

[Hook 2][Intro: Nic Goose]
Yeah, Nic Goose
Raider Klan in this bitch
O.F. in this bitch, uh

[Hook: Nic Goose]
No spirits, just cocaine cigarettes
Living life everyday like I don't give a shit
But I truly do, that's why I moved to the loot
Conversations of money and secret avenue's

[Verse 1: Nic Goose]
The picture is clear, my vision is too
Nowadays I'm tryna' figure what the Benjamin's do
Long nights with empty stomach's
Lung's full of cannabis constructed my mental to stay savage
You faggot's got the game fucked up, lucked up, and got a shot at fame
I line 'em up and let it buck and shoot it at they brain
Maintaining ignorant, to the regular state of mind
My hustle game is like, stronger than '89
I'm cut from a different cloth
Me and my family moved drastically
Go over the border of California
I'm open to mass opinion, but then again
Who's line is it anyway?
Nasal congestion from all the sick shit I french kiss
Bitches be playing, I let them get thick, then bitch dip
Tryna' phase me with your neck work numbers
We came from the bottom, but I felt the best each summer
Bed sheets to a bummer
Ayo, shouts to the real niggas doing it
Down south, midwest, eastcoast they exclusive
I'm having visions of old Chevelle's, Dave Chappelle in the background
Listening to your rap style and it's whack, wow
Inspired by my mama's struggle
You a snake in the grass and I'm a lion in the jungle
All reach serenity, till infinity
Hard top, a car to drop top, J. Kennedy

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: 2.7.5. Sky Lex]
I'm out here focused, these niggas hopeless
Out here tryna' get they money but they eye's ain't open
Bitch come here, it's the year
And she wanna sip some beer, well here dear
God damn, I take the bitch to the bar
I take that bitch to the car, hit her in the car
El Camino, chino
Bitch you wanna roll with me, I can get you like dino

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Left Brain]
I'm next, rolling in the fly Lex'
With my ex and my nigga Sky Lex
On the sky pager, 275
Probably with the drop, hop out in fly gators
I'm the nigga with the answers written on my wrists
On my palms, I cheated on the final
Rough draft written on your spinal
Coming through like a pack of rhino's
Living large, like a dinosaur
Niggas looking for the knowledge, you can't find no more
I'll come through nigga, like the comodores
A nigga out here motherfucker, find a nigga
Come through, my niggas will do a drive by nigga
On a skateboard, niggas hate more, cause they can't[Verse 1: Remy Banks]
Swerving in a hoopty, but a nigga not drunk
I'm high off of life, with a pinch of skunk
Maybe high off of determination, but I'm low on luck
Because we've been putting on for years, and people still be counting sheep on us
But its cool, I be that offspring dressed in all wolf clothing
With a mallet and a bell, just awaiting a rude awakening
Out here yellin Worlds Fair until the name ring
Hailing from a place where every nigga wanna be king
Plus this world is too cold, so I keep myself circle small
Puffing chronic with my dogs, chilly, but we holding down the city
And my burrow, feelin unstoppable like Tetsuo
Akira in the membrane Queens get the money
Yet I'm broke and going insane, stressed out my brain
Til it left on a train to Connecticut for the weekend
Might extended stay until I'm diving in the deep end
Of a pool full of euros, pounds, and yen, let's get this money, man

[Hook: Domo Genesis]
L said it's cold in this world, sometimes it's hard for me to crack a smile
That real shit is going out of style
These young niggas out here acting buck wild
We just need that real shit right now
L said it's cold in this world, somehow it's hard for me to crack a smile
That real shit is going out of style
These young niggas out here acting buck wild
They just need that real shit right now

[Verse 2: Domo Genesis]
For what it's worth, a nigga made his way from the dirt
All the times I went berserk, all ideas that didn't work
But we cherish when we hurt, we finished dinner and dessert
For every thought that hurt for the piece that I deserve I'm on the search
Many times a nigga felt that he would give in
Every dream that I would witness with previous premonitions
I knew that I would be this
It's never been a secret took a genius to believe it or an elitist to achieve it
I'm runnin overheated, but practice what I'm preachin
Never sleep and we catch you slippin and throw you in the deep end
I know some niggas died over pride, high
I know some fake niggas claim they ride, that's a lie
I know some hating niggas that when I rhyme, they despise
Wish I could share these visions through eyes
High like a fucking revolutionary
I'm droppin knowledge, and its only knowledge you should carry
Bitch, I'm the truth and everybody know the truth is scary

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Earl Sweatshirt]
Looking for shit to scratch up off this bucket list
Found a tug of war between my mother and my fucking friends
Fucking bucket, bumping nothing in the summer
Trying to chug a fifth of Jack in case you wondering where the ruckus went
I kept in the baggie of Oregano
Fronting like I'm selling dope, stunting with my effort low
Let the records show these niggas why they bitches neck is swole
It's OFM to the death of us, pigs, try to hem us up
The best wrestler's back guzzling seconds up
Using label checks to fuck around in the Cressida
And I'm advocating aggression
To any man who would test us, an avid fan of the presence of vodka
This drink is like my first time hearing Flocka
Hope is what the weed can't offer
Cheap ass, coughing, C-class method actor, young nigga
Dressing like I'm geriatric, said it's very active
Strong arm, steady swearing I could tear a mattress
Track-slapping 'em silly as Tom and Jerry tactics
Why you started? I fire harder than every rapper
Gassing these fairies, dare I say that he carry matches?

[Interlude: Hodgy Beats]
Hey, you think it’s a god damn joke, don’t you?
Well, let me tell you something boy!
It’s life around here, and in life, you’re gonna have to go to school…
[inaudible]

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Hodgy Beats]
No confusion apparent, I know who I am
Responsibility enables me to move through life with agility
Home donors, pressure in the endzone, but I breeze by skillfully
Practice makes perfect said the wise man, or so his whole life span
They said a man was part of the sea
By hand, what? could he divide land?
Coast West like a took a Vyvanse, I'm just a bystander
And what you capture in my stanzas is a crossbreed
OG and banana
A jealous man I envy, cause a jealous man is friendly
Award him like a Grammy, or rather Emmy
Television all science, and music is just enough to ear a Q-tip
Where the proof sits that smells like bull shits
Ain't it a shame when a nigga can't be honest?
And it's whats-her-name that can't keep a promise
Mind is with my Comcast
Watching what I do before it's on them dot-coms and hastags, nigga[Hook]
I say it's really cold, really cold in this world man
And nobody cares
Can't save the children, boys, little girls in this world
Cause it's filled by Wolverines and Bears
I wouldn't wanna be isolated, with no one to share

[Verse 1]
I'm heated, and it's cold outside, freezing
I'm in the 609 chiefing, with one of my peeps takin' vacation
Leavin' jail time and bail money
Or ironic to each, plus the court fees and a good lawyer
Knowing a nigga guilty
Man he was riding filthy
Heard his homie was snitching on em, stealing money on the side
Wired by cops, they stitched it on 'em
The lines he pitched were sure to pick apart the picnic homie
Now I won't see him, i'm feeling distanced
He's sitting in prison homie
I work a different type of work, he work until the pistol bursts
Do dirt but first check for the clerk
Move work put that dead weight in the hearse
Cool nurse, i'm bruising, hurt
And I'm sick to my stomach
Dealing with sticky situations
Consequences coming from me


[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yo here I go I do me
Twenty four seven, three sixty five, seven days of the week
They see me shining at they beef
Man that mentality's weak
Man you ain't getting off you feet
When your shots fall too cheap
Probably consumer, childish loser
Make your bed in your sleep
Idle time will kill a niggas mind
I'm responsible for responding, clearly a waste of time
I practice positivity since Trenton arrived pre-history
Not to blame him but he changed me realistically
It's my job to roll clean your jobs to watch me to misery
Bringing a cold storm like a wizard in blizzardry
I'm an adult, you're a kid to me, stuffin' blunts into nicotine
Kickin' back watching my niggas TV show on the TV screen

[Hook](Left Brain)
Left Brain

Bitches all wanna be in the club with me, me
Bottles of the rosay in that V.I.P., P
With the Wolf Gang, Yeah you wanna be
Just because you got that ass don't mean you gonna be
I know what you want, you want this dick inside you
You want me to be your man and stand beside
I'm a player, A.K.A. a slayer
I fleed out the scene told her see you later
Bitch, chocolate chip, what you drinkin' tonight
I'm sippin on that promethazine, codeine sprite
Yeah I'm moving slow, but the music is fast
Don't even start thinking about my cash
Yeah I know a nigga just payed for that cab
Cause driving drunk will end up in a bloody crash
But fuck it in the end of the night, I'm very well
And you can go and tell your friends the fairytale, Whoa

(Hook)

(Hodgy Beats)

Keep on playin''round
Watch you bump yo head
Hit yo noggin hard
Should've listened to what I said
Wisdom from the wise
Eyes all bloody red
Intoxicated dreams
Woke up in hell instead
Of my cow kid cottin
And a lady of breast
Neighboring my flavoring
Tryna see which move was next
Bitch I'm a secret agent
Fuck up as my gun
Maggin' up, extended thumb
Dragon tounge, nigga fire
You needa stop playin' round
Curiousity killed the cat
But you roll in dark and nightime like a bat
Niggas be on the corner tryna teach themself how to ollie
And I ain't catching them catching the 7 bus home until I got it
Life of a teenanger, young, black in the hood
Aspirations of making out so everything can be good
Mellowhype lifestyle, odd future records
We the hot shit got them sneezing out this pepper, oooh[Intro]
Mike G
Left Brain

[Hook: Left Brain] x2
Riding with my niggas
Got them fingers on them triggers
And we shootin' at the piggas
Cause you know we don't give a
Damn
Nigga know we don't give a
Damn
Nigga know we dont give a
Damn

[Verse 1: Mike G]
Daytime matters not
We still throw back shots
And we cause road blocks
Turn streets into parking lots
My income now comes in like volleys in tennis
And I own this, in a sense every person's a tenant
In a week I can come up to a Porsche from a Honda
Feds be lurking dip through Hollywood, dont turn on Santa Monica
Stack commas, you get richer
Zeros on Mondays
And bring dounuts for the bitches
Everything with best intentions
Figure them out
Now my women run to give me hugs
They love drinking drugs
They no loser in his game
Is the first to fall in love
I won't lie
It was easy to get you
Now since im with you
Friends wanna join the club
If it every jumps off
They we will get ill
With the smoke kills
Got you throat oh so chill
We turn it up
Till this loud like heavy metal
Loud like punk rock
Got issues in this loiter squad
Lurking in your parking lot

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Mike G]
I cruise through with a skateboarder’s frame
I reign so long I could douse spitfire’s flames
So lifted
With my weapon to the ground I aim
And if I fire off rounds I can shoot down planes
I'm a walking masterpiece
An audible art of war
Life's not a movie
Our tours are blockbusters like Jaws
I'm a universal legend
We switch lives for a day
Broke niggas be in heaven
Judgmental then you need lessons
You should be second guessing
Your wardrobe selection
Your doors are closed like criminals
With excessive arrest
See you rocking with the best
I can do this forever nigga
I'm up for whatever
Down for murder anytime
Temperature, any weather
My aim is to get better
And you listen to my lectures
Like college professors
Stack green
I got flow
You can't store in canteens
I'm the man
I'm the sun
I'm a lion
I'm a king
I'm

[Hook x2][Produced by Left Brain]

[Verse 1]
My fire scorching, it's red
People raining on my name, can't change a scorpion's prayers
Niggas tryna' sue a younging at an unfornuate bread
Told my son that I'ma kill till every portion is dead
I mean that, back when I was his age, my momma would tote the switchblade
Cause out in Trenton, niggas wasn't bitch made
When I grow up, I'ma get paid and treat everyday like it's a big day
And have all these hootchies ride my dick, like a big wave
Smoke till my mind gone
Some where else, in a different time zone
HB baby, he gon' get his shine on
Worry about what I'm on, nigga what are you on?
Food 4 Less and coupons greyer than the news, uh
You hating on the truth, uh
My minds gone, the roofs gone
Tahoe and the coupe
How about 80, what it do? uh
I'm hot like when your food come
Me and music having two sums
On the cool drums, cruising through slums
Windows crack cause I blew one
My flame is torched and it's blue
I'm going to the source of course to get my Pepé Le Pew
All these niggas talk like hoes, don't wanna step and dispute
Cause my presence bulletproof and we destined to shoot, rahh

[Hook]
I do it to the fullest
I do it to the fullest
Nigga, I do it to the fullest
I do it to the fullest
Bitch, I do it to the fullest
I do it to the fullest
Little homie, I do it to the fullest
I do it to the fullest

[Verse 2]
I'm practicing on my bass guitar
And tucking Mary Jane to sleep in a Cuban cigar
My niggas talk when there is beef, man, I put that on God
Rest in peace, I hold my piece
Between the sheets like Isla
She come with more than one freak, I'm all about variety
Moving silently, quietly, hybridly, no dividing me
If I go, I'm going violently, rioting fragrant firing
I'm the nigga for the job you should be hiring
Got a good heart corrupted mind that needs some rewiring
But I do my deeds when needs are met which makes me inspiring
Niggas deals fucked up mad at us, you shouldn't have signed no contract
While I'm on tour running wild in Australia like a wombat
Golf Wang tom cat, said you dropping bombs
Well motherfucker, where your bombs at?
I blow, where your time map?
And record it on the time lapse
'X' marks spot, nigga, Imma find that, you better recline back
And take a chill pill this the motherfucking climax
Word to real is steel, turning tables getting highjacked
These niggas know the deal and you hiding behind the blind fact

[Hook]

[Outro]
Look out for me lil homie[Tyler]
In the back of a truck with a gay slut
Tryna bust a nut in her butt with no makeup
Passed out, this dead bitch don't wanna wake up
Fuck Rachael Ray, cause she tryna get a cake-up
Eatin' donuts (white hoes)
Gettin' high as fuck (snort coke)
Whoa, I'm just tryna finger it in your hot car
Fuck a nigga, just fuck here in top block
I'm a unicorn (yeah), you aren't a unicorn (yeah)
Now I'm a uniform (yeah), rapin' you to perform (what?)
Made me doper than my shrooms in my system
My trophy sister, she'll get mugged
Right in the back of a club with a
45 shotty, bet you 30 dollars you won't
Find her body, now she's fucked
Get these bitches love drunk

[Hook]
What up what up, what's goin' on?
This OF, up on the song
Why you staring over here like something's wrong?
We the West over here, nigga sing along
What up what up, what's goin' on?
This OF, up on the song
(Bitch)

[Mike G]
Uh, in the back of a blue truck, fucked up
Rollin' dice, snake eyes, niggas ain't got luck
I just lay back, still ain't blew up
Honey got me some of that rum like I threw up
You should really fear me
Made this bitch squint and couldn't see me clearly
Bitch I'm a gift like you lookin' at Christmas
You should look up to him, now you on my shit list
Bitch I ain't fucked with you before
You ain't gotta hound me when I step through the door
I'm the best doin' it
He's spittin' that super shit
Why the nigga so lame
I don't even say his name
But he white like cocaine
This is fire, propane

[Hook]

[Tyler]
Wait a minute, what's your name?
Let's play a game of balls in your throat
Smell like fish, cheesy like a goat, bitch
The only that she good for is sucking dick

[Mike G]
And I came quick
I fucked a bitch in a plaid skirt
I mean raped, don't ask her
Then I put the quick punch on her lip
Bade her in the basement

[Tyler]
I was wearing a really nice dress
With sweet puffs, green and white
This is nice, I look nice
Fix my dick...
Check it twice[Hook]
All the bad bitches boo when you rap
I can teach you how to pull 'em like a tutor, in fact
I got one in the front and two in the back
And the bitches keep screaming "Odd Future is back"

[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
Wolf with a T-Rex cock, less talk
While I invest stock in wet rock
Smoke with all the big bitches bumping "Bedrock"
Sub in the trunk, thumping up against the dead cops
And pop it like I tossed a match in the engine
And go harder than a fucking crack intervention
Clown of the class and the last to attend it
Big Earl make you fags stand at attention
Odd Future, I'm your motherfucking general
Catch 'em where them slap, slash, stab bitch ass niggas go
Girl, you ain't even gotta ask cause you finna know
Why this Playboy so sticky in this centerfold
Sticky what my niggas blow, icky Earl finish foes
Hit 'em low, riddle them with Chronicles of Riddick bows
Chronic in the spliff to the dome, got my system slow
So I'm walking out, ask them niggas what they sprinting fo'

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Vince Staples]
Black Ted Bundy sick as John Gacy
Chilling with a possible victim, she was 18
A hitchhiker hippie whore, met her at the liquor store
She frequented to help support the habit picked up in the fourth
Grade A piece of ass, so I plan on screwing it
Slipped of a couple Rufilin inside the bitch's juice and gin
Next thing you know, we're on Earl's burgundy carpet
She's kicking and screaming, begging for me to fucking stop it
Look, you know it's not rape if you like it, bitch
So sit down like a pretty ho and don't fight the shit
Or else I'll have to tie a pretty bow 'round your bloody neck
Hide the slices from the gashes given with a dull Gillette
Mop the blood up, put the body in the apartment
Stash it where we hide the marijuana and the condoms
"Hey, what's that?" Don't touch it or even fucking look
You are Fantasia and the body bag's a fucking book

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yo Vince, let me tell you 'bout these hoes I met last night
They thought I was cute 'til I asked what that ass like
Damn right, red light, ran right through it
"You don't even have your permit, what the fuck are you doing?"
Maybe if you shut the fuck up, we'd be cruising
And you wouldn't be sitting, boohooing 'bout your bruises
But no, you wanna be Miss Fuck-with-the-Music
I'm zoning on Relapse, she's sliding on Blueprint
Three seconds it takes for her to turn blue
With my hands around her throat, her arms stopped moving
Pulse stops too, in the back, look confused
As I turn to tell them both not to do shit stupid
Red, white, blue lights in the rear-view, shit
Swerved to the shoulder, tell them both no moving
Sit down in the back, cause the windows tinted
As I rolled down mine to forge a new friendship
"Aren't you a little too young to be driving?"
Look Officer, I'm just tryna get home
"Get out the fucking car with your license and registration"
I ain't getting outta shit, you're starting to try my patience
Didn't have backup, I could tell by the Hummingbike
Reached to the glove, grabbed the motherfucking hunting knife
Stabbed him in his neck and hip, threw him in the trunk and dipped
Back to the fucking crib for some tea and crumpets, shit

[Outro]
All the bad bitches boo when you rap
I can teach you how to pull ‘em like a tutor, in fact
A dead one in the front, dead cop in the back
And two live bitches screaming "Odd Future is back"[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
I’m attacking your captain, Battle raps
Shitting, clogging and calling your plumber
How these old ass niggas newcomers?
I’m coming sunny, mid-summer
Nose runny,  gunning like hunters
While tune and jazz gunthers
Fuckboys listening to gangsta records
Now they flex like Bedford
Knowing that I take they wives,  Stepford
I’m all about the extras, nigga read all about it
Extra tits, excessive spliffs, clouded, surrounded never grounded
Higher than my curb palace
Wondering lands of lakes with alice
My point is valid when my character is challenged
Looking malice in the face like "bitch you owe me a favor"
Turn my head to karma, fuck it I’ll deal with you later
I’m the exterminator, my eyes low and red like the terminator
Arnold Schwarzenegger perpetrator
Pepper spraying the furthest hater
Nigga my service awaits ya, wake Up and
Smell the percolator
I’m smoking and blowing gators

[Verse 2: Domo Genesis]
Fuck the whole world, I fuck a niggas bitch
I fuck the rap game with my fist til’ I get sick of this
Spittin’ sick, ripping through visions of written syphilis
He slit his wrist to ink all these verses, blood in my penmanship
Hit or miss, bitch I’m batting like I’m on PED’s
Niggas want to switch they words like baby boy on BET
Young niggas still cruising we’re moving like he’s Eazy- E
Easy spitting ether watchem’ freak and leak like Petey-P
Fuck everybody, no love for human ecology
I bomb like I’m Islamic for all the shit you ain't promise me
Fuck is competition? Nobody poppin’ as hot as me
I’m running shit, several miles ahead and still ain’t stopped to breathe
I don’t need no help, my bitches tell me by myself
Fuck with my niggas from OF, don’t feel nobody else
Still perfecting my rhymes, you niggas chilling on the shelf
Watching my steps, you like my kid I’ll hit you with a belt

[Hook: Hodgy Beats and Domo Genesis]
I got it covered
I’m ontop of that (ontop of that)
They pop and live I’m stopping that
Fuck ya’ little raps nigga Hip hop is back
Popping straps, stocking caps
Buy some crack
Can’t forget we smoking weed (Bitch a lot of that)
Remember that you’re fucking with the wolf gang
The louder pack
Remember that my niggas gotta eat
We browse your house in fact
In fact we’ll take your spouse and nap with her
Then we’ll bounce her back, nigga

[Verse 3: Domo Genesis]
Crazy, I'm crashing shit as fast as
Whatever won't crash under pressure
I'm blasting til I grab my endeavors
I'm trashing whoever, no obstacle could stop this view on top of you
I lost a screw, my thoughts are loose
I cop the coupe, forgot the roof
I got the flu: think you sick? I'll spit a pot of soup
I'm stopping through to give em instructions on what they're not to do
Nigga's think they're into something, really they ain't got a clue
Racing for my space gotta slow em down like a chop and screw
I'm powering prose, slightly powered his nose
Doped out of control, aura overpower you hoes
How the fuck they still sleeping?
Wake em up to a double barrel
Fuck beef, bitch we biting through the fucking bone marrow
Pedal to the floor, I accelerate through nonsense
Imma snap and I'mma keep it like a quarterback with options
I'm so faded off the sweet, one more please I'll be unconscious
Shit, I'm dropping, got me poppin
All Star, Western Conference

[Verse 4: Hodgy Beats]
Bitch, I be hitting the pocket, pockets so deep in my pants
Rock it obese, take a glance swat and flee gon' flee where I stand
You ain't poppin that, I'm poppin with pumpkin seeds in his hand
Jack-O-Lantern, back for Santa his reindeer breaking antlers
Fuck asking questions, I'm taking answers and women on dates with Prancer
By night you turn rapper to dancer washed up sitting in the hamper
Mildew-filled flows damper like grandmama pampers
Took a piss, that's on her fishnets, smell like dry fish and sweats
Look at this guy, man hits nets, get high above [?]
Fucking chin-check insects from your shin to your biceps
Money hungry till I'm comfy stuffing duffles with mushroom truffles
I hate life, cause I love the troubles, karma comes in doubles
And I check, stuff the couple all I know is struggle, all I see is rubble
Jumpstart on the ground to the sky like a fucking shuttle
My country looks like a puzzle. Time's the limit, get your hustle

[Hook]
