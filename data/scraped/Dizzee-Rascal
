[Verse 1: Giggs]
Cause man ain't bumping him or you
Man ain't bumping him either
Man ain't come for him
Man ain't come to grin neither
Man ain't comforting geezers, ease up
Man ain't jumping in neither
Man just jumpy and eager beavers
Shit ain't sunken in neither
Man just old school from Gloucester Grove
When man had comfortable Fila
Back when [?] didn't even live there
It was Josh and Makeda
Back when gangsters weren't even shooting
Man took chunks with that cleaver
Back all Super Dee, Stone Love days
Yep, Jamrock Sound, Metro Media

[Verse 2: Dizzee]
Back in the day when I was broke
I was on Bow Road and looking out for eaters
Back in the day before I had seven figures
Our bredders were begging me for features
Back in the day before bloggers and tweeters
Before they knew I was a genius
They were the days when I was excluded
From school for fucking with my teachers
I was so damn facetious
I would leave em with fevers
Seizures, bunch of holes in my sneakers
Back in the day before I had that
Brand new Range Rover, looking devious
Previous, I was moving mischievous
None of my girlfriends were divas
Making moves was the easiest
Please don't make me get deeper
I was linking Kamika
Ice Rink and that Creeper
Had em dropping in caesars
Jesus, bunch of unstable geezers
Bunch of peelers and dealers
Demons, they were holding them beaters
We were owning them speakers

[Verse 3: Giggs]
Man came back with that classic
Man came back with that Raskit
Rolled up with them Rottweilers
And came back with Bullmastiffs
Quickly grab them six brownings
Women grab me two taxis
There's a negative and a plus side
Hollow's back with new batteries
Hold up, coming back for you fassies
Better run home, could I [?] the new lassy
Them two straps are too massive
Jumped out, pap pap pap with two maccies
Quick, jump back in front seat and back seat
Pricks get bought Ribena and Capri

[Verse 4: Dizzee]
Don't gas me
I was in the back streets, couldn't catch me
On a jack spree
They looking at me like "why you wanna rap me?", that's crappy
I was actually not flashy
They couldn't hack me
All-black in my Nike Air tracky
And I went all out on a fassy
And I didn't make beats on a lappy
What you know about Rex in Stratty? Exactly
Had a yatty, in Hackney
Big batty, a bit scatty
But I was happy
Cause she cooked saltfish and ackee
She didn't clap me
So I've gotta give thanks to Selassie
Shy FX and UK Apache

[Verse 5: Giggs]
The speaker blowing, better keep it going
Mention Hollowman when your speaker flowing
Get that mozzarella cheese, get the pizza going
Seen your gully side, now your weak is showing
My nigga Dizzee Ras, they say he's a poet
They hear we drop a track, niggas tippy-toeing
Now come around a man with your pissy poems
I've got bitches on my dick and their lippy showing[Hook]
All I do is flex, I don't need a reason
All I want is sex, I don't need a reason
Fly out on a jet, I don't need a reason
Every day's a never ending summer season
All eyes on me

[Verse 1]
160, blink and miss me
Super nifty, riding swiftly
Rolling through the sticks
Leather extra crispy, effortlessly
Power steering, accurately, ready for action, actually
Mellow, relaxed and cocking my snapback
Not taking no God damn back chat
Just racking up fat stacks
No ring, no chain, no fat chaps
I don't get no sleep, no cat naps
And everybody wanna be on my black sack
But I don't slack
You don't really wanna see me get abstract
I'll switch up the place like have that
Don't care about none of that rap crap
Steer clear of the rat trap
Some say that I lack tact
But I'm on the map
And I'm setting the pace, I'm on track
So get out my face, I'm on slapping
I'm on scrapping, so stop yapping, what's crackalacking?
Don't follow fashion, just keeping it G
With these hoes, macking, and that's what's happening
What?
That's what's happening

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
God bless me, nobody can't test me
Everyday life can't stress me, stay on the ball like Messi
Money and women are the only things that impress me
I stay fly and sexy
Life is a game of chess, and all the girls wanna check me
How much do you wanna bet me, that I never ever let a female sweat me?
Get me
I ain't gotta talk no more, cause soon as I walk in the door everybody stops doing what they're doing, don't know what they're pausing for, don't know what they're gawping for
Bad boy from the LDN, what the world's been calling for, been balling for
And your girl gets wet, stays up in the morning for
Don't know what you're stalling for
Get with the programme, I got the flow and I've got the dough and money to blow
And, this ain't a slow jam, ready to rock and I'm ready to roll, I'm gripping at the Trojan
Never gonna get caught slipping, never gonna get caught tripping
Never too soft on the women
If it ever gets too hot in the kitchen, I'm dipping, I ain't gonna stand there dripping, I'm missing

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
International, flex and go
When I'm at home, I stay low
Yo, lay in the cut, they can't see me bro
And I'm living it up, they can't be me though
Get on the mic, I get easy dough
When I'm cutting the cheques, cause I'm C.E.O
Keep on fronting, like you don't know
I stay repping the Manor, and that's E3, Bow
Stay with a brownin', get around the town, you better hold it down
I'll leave you breathing slow
Overstand, cause I ain't even clowning, I'll leave you drowning from head to toe
Wet, why you trying to put me in check?
I play for keeps, you better know I don't pet
Knock your head off your shoulders, no sweat, watch your step

[Hook][Intro: Fekky]
Yeah, I like that
Cuh right now
I feel like that Boy in Da Corner
Fekky
Shout out Dizzee
Yeahhhhhhhhhhhh
(Splurge Boys)
Get me
It's Live O (x3)
Fekky
Yeah (x4)

[Hook: Fekky]
I'm just sitting here
Doing what I do (shut up)
Smoking on a big fat zoot
I heard they wanna make a move (come on then)
You must be blood
I've got that ting and it goes bang
Bu bu bang bang bang (x2)
It's Live O
My crew is live o (trust me it's live o)

[Verse 1: Dizzee Rascal]
Breddas wanna test my frame
They wanna test my aim
Hoes wanna throw shit on my name
Sorry if I ain't all smiles when you see me in the streets
Yo I got a lot of shit on my brain
A lot of pressure to maintain
But you don't wanna hear me complain
About the pitfalls of fame
You wanna see me knuckle up and go against the grain
And frankly I feel the same
So I'm bringing the pain
Fuck being restrained
These breddas are lame
Fuck being the same
More heart in my testicular vein
I'm ready for war
Everybody feels real til they're laying dead on the floor
I've seen it before
I'm so easily bored
You should be checking out the women
What you preeing me for?
If you don't wanna meet your maker better settle your damn jaw
Smoke a lot of weed but I'm going to Dam for more
Maybe a sativa that'll settle my anger or
Light my head space
So I can elevate and get away from your dead face
And dead waste
Wannabee hard nuts and gangstas
I'm sick of these wankers
Knock me out or drop me out
Stab me shoot it out
Or shut you mouth
Dunno what your talking about
You got a problem sort it out
Count 10 and just walk it out
Kill any ideas that you thought about
You don't wanna see your soul go walkabouts
Body on the floor chalk it out
Close your spout
Please put a stop to that noise that you're squawking out
And have a breather
Go disrupt another geezer
Time is money and I'm tight like Ebenezer
I just wanna chill for real where all the trees are
Kill yourself it'll be easier

[Hook: Fekky]

[Verse 2:Fekky]
It's live o
Shut your pie hole (shut up)
You wanna call on war
Then run to the 5-0 (Bang)
Ain't got a mill, but I'm alright though
These Vivienne Westwood shoes, a man moonwalk like Michael (ooowwwww)
Rappers don't be scared, nobody wants your title
Came in the game, bu bu bang fuck up the cycle
Rob me are you mad (mad)
Jumping man like a psycho (yeahhh)
These niggas might like your pics
But these niggas don't like you
Big Fekky, Big Fekky
I'm just sittin' here
Tell 'em come and get me
As I sit here and I lay back
Hot choc and some flapjacks
Bitch says she hates me
Fucked her and she came back
Bu bu bang (yeah)
You're just a bunch of nobodies
No dough, no weed, no straps, no bodies
Dead gyal, bad weave, no tits, no bodies (yeah)
Who does it like me, nobody

[Hook: Fekky][Hook: Teddy Sky]
I will fight till I take my last breath
I got the heart of a warrior
The heart of a warrior
I’ve been down, I’ve been out and I bled
I got the heart of a warrior
The heart of a warrior
I’ll never back down

[Verse 1: Dizzee Rascal]
Born fearless, leavin when it’s delirious
Superstar and super serious
Runnin the game like I was born gearless
Deeper guy, I got the beat to live em earless
Still I know that they still hear us
Only rap, we make an appearance
So I shout, shout, let it out
Remain tearless ‘cause I’m careless
Doing it for the man dem in the hoodies and the new eras
Young ragamuffin, can't tell me nothing
Miss me with that huff and puffing
You ain't ready to buck and get stuck in
You're just doing a lot of chuckin
I’m just doing a lot of talkin'
Are you sick or something?
Are you thick or something?
You should think of ducking
Hit you with that nunchukka
I Bruce Lee your fly kick
Jump up and Tom pop and I’ve got something
Nigga they comin hard for they food
Don’t wanna see me switch and lose my cool
‘Cause I be up with that fool, hard but you have to smooth, I be actin a fool
I be actin a fool… I be actin a fool… I be actin a fool… I be actin a fool…

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Dizzee Rascal]
When the bumper clean shake the earth right underneath
Pick up the devil sides and let them call me thunder feet
If you want a war I’m not the one to meet, I’m not sure I’m the sweet
I’m like a tropic in the summer, come with heat
Not to blow my own brass but I’m having a blast
Spendin my paper fast
Think I’m movin around, start havin a laugh
Competition’s lookin over bars and I’m last nice
Be fragile, reppin the underclass
Miss me with your problems cuz I can’t be yours
Who Jeremy call, I look at the wall
You star, we size em all
You like to profile, you just a child that’s in denial
Now you’re on trial
You should bring the mind with me while we’re flexin
Good with nothing but a swagger and the crooked fall
Hentai but never get rinced out cuz I stay fresh out
No doubt, don’t say no
I’m giving a proper, keep a pitch out
I’m sittin here, I don’t think about her
I’m black tie, I’m tweeted up
It’s amazing what you can when you put your finger up

[Hook]

[Bridge: Teddy Sky]
Now now I was way through the fire
Yea yea I got the eye of the tiger
So tell me, what’s gonna stop me now
God knows that I put in the hours
I can’t lose now, I got the power
We at the top blowin smoke in the sky
But I’mma take it just a little bit higher

[Hook][Intro]
Ascended masters of angels of light, but you're actually deceiving demonic spirits , which can not only hurt somebody externally, they can destroy their spirits as well

[Verse 1]
I don't speak queen's English but I'm still distinguished
I don't need no suit or tie to let you know I mean business
I know you're into this
Even even if you were deaf, blind and dumb and awkwardly rhythmless
I'm like syphilis ain't no denying this wickedness
Any attempt would be grimy and hideous
Young and I'm black and I'm ignorant
But I'm still frivolous
Meaning I'm nigga-less
More than the way I feel strength in my pigments
What does it matter? Just give me my dividends
Switching up syllables mixing with criminals
Keep up appearance but keeping it minimal
Bredders be getting too over familiar
Quizzical, touching your physical
Hands on my bread with a spoon in my cereal
Not on my watch cause I'm a hard rock
Come through in a hard top
With your girl in the passenger seat, she getting hard cock
I didn't even let the car stop
Don't even worry what cars I've got
You should be concerned with what you are not
I dictate the pace and set the bar a lot
You get parred a lot
Sorry pardon what?
I can't hear you bro you sound weary bro
Talk shit but you won't come near me though
And I'm far from sweet I'm no Cheerio
I switch up the place real quick like hear we go
Leave your body all black with a whole lot of indigo
Six feet below
No heads up, no intro
No info I get it in bro

[Verse 2: Dizzee Rascal]
Cold world with a whole lot of schemers
It don't stop for the dreamers
You could fuck around and get took to the cleaners
I know man that would do a lot of dirty
Put a lot of work in
Just to ride Benz and Beamers
Devious creatures
Try to steer clear of the preachers
Screaming out 'God can't reach us'
Nothing they can teach us, leave us
Looking for a girl with over the top features
Couldn't care less about Jesus
Couldn't give a fuck about a thesis
Looking for the easiest next top model
Or another shit TV series
Raised by MTV generation
Not a lot of patience
Update Facebook status, no hesitation
How they gonna deal with the wolves of the nation
How they gonna recognize pros and cons with no education
How they gonna win with no dedication
All you really care about is Playstation
World Star Hip Hop humiliation
Everything built on a weak foundation
Whole lot of time being wasted
Whole lot of shit champagne being tasted
Everybody in the club acting basic
Everybody wanna be a star let's face it
Gassed by the money and the fame let's chase it
Gotta get it quick gotta get it by all means
Wanna be a big timer like the guy from New Orleans
Got big dreams, but they absurd, and they obscene
Pregnant on TV at sixteen
Don't know what this shit means

Yo, can't trust these no-good, two-faced cut-throat Pagans living in Babylon
Wanna sell me lies, wanna bleed me dry, wanna see me live like a vagabond
Like I worked this hard and I come this far just to them waffle and babble on
Don't want your help, don't need your advice who rattled your cage
Know one of these days won't cease to amaze
Bunch of lost souls they ain't tryna get saved
They're just tryna get paid, wanna jump on my wave
Turn back around, jump right in my grave
Do me a favour, don't do me no favours
I don't need no savior cause I do it major
Now it's back to the paper I'll deal with the pagans later[Verse 1]
Yo If that girl knows where you stay that's poor
Some whore banging on your door what for
Pregnant? What're you talking about, be sure
Fifteen, she's underage, that's raw
And against law 5 years or more
And she wants a score and half of a draw
That's the kind of threat that you can't ignore
That whore got you pinned down to the floor
But it's your own fault, you said three magic words (I love you)
When that's the one for the birds
When you said that she forgot other boys
It's over, you better start buying the toys
There was no intention of her being wife
Now she knows this she's ending your life
It's a real shame you got had by the whores
It's a shame that kid probably ain't yours

[Hook]
[Boy]
That girl' some bitch ya know
She keep calling my phone
She don't leave me alone
She just moan and groan
She just keep ringin' me at home
These days I don't answer my phone
[Girl]
That boy' some prick you kna'
All up in my hair
Thinks that I care
Keeps following me here
Keeps following me there
These days I can't go nowhere
Ain't that your girl
[Dizzee]
Nah it ain't my girl
[Girl]
I swear that's your girl
[Dizzee]
Course it ain't my girl
[Girl]
She got juiced up
[Dizzee]
Oh well
[Girl]
She got jacked up
[Dizzee]
Oh well!
[Dizzee]
I swear that's your man
[Girl]
I ain't got no man
[Dizzee]
You was with that man
[Girl]
He was just ANY man
[Dizzee]
He got hotted up
[Girl]
Oh well
[Dizzee]
He got whacked up
[Girl]
Oh well!

[Verse 2]
Alright, she's a bad girl, I'm a boss though
Captain Roscoe with a crossbow
She came she got picked off yo
Nah its not a love ting, get lost ho
Dizzee Rascal come down like snow
With freezing cold flows like Moscow
Dumb ho, get me upset, guns blow
Bitch, you're not ready for skid row
Bleed know Dizzee Rascal did grow
Big feet for the force on my big toe
I got no chaps, no chains, not much dough
Get juiced but you don't get love though
No slap but you might get a co-co
Jambo coming through like Rambo
Love ting takes two like tango
But she ain't my wifey, she can go

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Listen, I like your girl so you better look after your girl
Or I might just take your girl and make your girl my girl
Switch your girl with Michelle
Switch Michelle with Chantelle
Play Chantelle with Shanell
Lyrical clientele but I ain't a bow cat, I don't like the smell
I'm gonna go through a shell and make a boy feel unwell
That girl's from school, that girl's from college
That girl gives brains, that girl gives knowledge
That girl gives head, that girl gives shines
That girl gives bj's at all times
She looks decent, she looks fine
But don't talk about wifey she's not mine
She got batteried, 6 in a line, believe me that's not a good sign

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Uh, Dizzee Rascal
Roll Deep, it's all love, ha ha
2000 and slew, get me
Damn right I'm articulate, I'm not an idiot
Dem boy not ready yet, trend they could never set
This is the next step
I write the 2-step
Niggas better get set
I'll make your girl wet[Hook x2]
Fix up look sharp
Don't make me get the blitz out get dark
Hear the bang, see the spark
Duck down, lay down just
I got the big beat
I hear the sound
I got the big beat, Dizzee Rascal
I get on down rolling deep

[Verse 1]
I've heard the gossip from the street to the slammer
They're trying to see if Dizzee stays true to his grammar
Being a celebrity don't mean shit to me
Fuck the glitz and glamor
Hit em with the Blitz and Hammer
Because they're talking bout rushing
Talk behind my back but to my face they say nothing
Stand up in the dance, keep a firm steady stance
Keep the beanies touching, keep the beanies hot flushing
Flushing MC's down the loo
If you don't believe me bring your posse, bring your crew
Feel free to hate cos I ain't tryna be your mate
Be serious, you wouldn't last an hour in my shoe
It's an Air Force One
Trainers by the truck load, trainers by the ton
Don't be dazed when I catch you by your J's
Chump, best to act like Forest Gump, best to run

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I stay sweet as a nut, sweet like Tropicana
When the hammer hits, your head splits like banana
You're not ready for this boy
You better send your best soldiers, this is Captain Roscoe
More destructive and troublesome than ever
I'll probably be doing this, probably forever
Fellas wanna stop me they'll probably come together
Its probable they'll stop me, probably never
Yo topboy, topman, or top a topper
Come to me with an attitude, come a cropper
I'm old school like Happy Shopper
I fight old school, bring your bat and your chopper
And a First Aid kit and some antiseptic, this could get hectic
I'm a don accept it, you gotta bright future
Don't let my gun affect it

[Hook x2][Verse 1: Dizzee Rascal]
Yo, I don't promote no violence but
If that boy gets arrogant I'll
Leave that boy in the basement so
Done with the bad boy talk, just walk
I'm not a female beater but if that girl gets facety I'll
Slap that girl all hasty cos
She might be buff but she's not ruff
I can't believe I'm hearing that
Boy thinks I'm not near him, just
Let me draw his girlfriend home
Cut no slack, she'll never go back
Marriage, love, wife; please!
All that talk is stupid plus
I don't believe in cupid cos
Sometimes most times everyone 2-times

[Hook]
Who do they think they are?
You push me too far
Look I don't care who you are
No I'm a super, superstar
Who do they think they are?
You push me too far
Look I don't care who you are
No

[Verse 2: Dizzee Rascal]
Yo, yo I don't obey no policemen cos
They forget they're human uh
Get excited quickly but
He ain't got a gun, I'll kick him and run
Don't tell me about royalty cos
Queen Elizabeth don't know me so
How can she control me when I live street and she lives neat
I love raves and concerts but
There's just too much violence and
I can't stand no nonsense uhhh
Book me, watch me, hear me, pay me
I've been far too friendly now
Everybody wants a favour but
I'm not no ones saviour cos
Where was you when I was blue?!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Dizzee Rascal]
Yo, talk in the mic I'll talk neat
Talk to your wife I'll talk sweet
Talkin' tough I'll talk with my feet
Rascal's raw like red meat
Talk, act, talk rough
Talk sexy, talk buff
Certain girls talk 'nuff
Talk anything, anywhere, any stuff
Yeah we got style, we'll get gash
Yeah we got style, we'll make cash
Certain man talk trash
Act funny, act flash
Bring your bora, bring your mash
Get banged, get bashed
I don't care who they are, where they are
If they wanna bring the beef we ain't far

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Wiley]
I was hot steppin' in my Nike Air sneaker
You didn't know I was an MC beater, defeater
Giving the MC a sleeper
I'm in to win fairly I'm not a cheater
I'm starving, hungry ready to eat her
Your drinks sweet but my drinks sweeter though
I'm getting stronger bro, you're getting weaker bro
I came straight from the gutter, lay low
I'm a ninja turtle, you can't step into my circle
In a sound clash I will hurt you
Paper, ask that mover
They don't wanna make paper, they want a place on the floor and choong
That's what I want
I want choong things, a double bed fling with a choong ting
Wiley, Rascal that's the boom-ting
Galdem-a bang on my ends
No long ting!

[Hook x2][Intro: Sean Kingston]
Kingston
RedOne
Dizzee

[Verse 1: Dizzee Rascal]
Look at that back off, stacked tough
Maybe when the jack off
I gotta take my hat off
Standing ovation, round of applause
Clap off, all up in my face
I could never lose track of
I don't wanna sound rude
But you got a lot of cheek
And your body looks peak sweet pea
Good enough to eat
I'm guessin you're a lover in the sheets
I really wanna be
And I ain't never seen a bottom like that before
I ain't never seen a bum so fat before
You got back galore
I'll be a happy chappy if you let me smack it for you
Tap it for you, slap it for you
I don't wanna waste your time
But I wanna chase what's under your waistline, I'm fine
I'm just having a bone but I'm zonin
Wishing I could own it
I just wanna promote it and bone it

[Hook: Sean Kingston]
You got em falling like when you break it down
You're like a heart attack yeah
No wonder no man around you can act sane
When you're moving like that
But they don't understand that they don't got a chance
Cause I got other plans for us tonight
You got em falling like when you break it down
Cause they never seen an arse like that
Ouch!
Arse like that
Ouch!
Arse like that

[Verse 2: Dizzee Rascal]
Your buff is done, your arse is retarded
A lot of junk in your trunk but far from garbage
You're a keeper, come and ride in my 2 seater
Late night creeper, I'm pleased to meet ya
Hate to see you go, love to see you leave
Figure I can't perceive
Wondering how you achieved such a beautiful body, I can't believe
So sorry I'm lost for words, I could hardly breathe
God give me strength, your [?] a blessing
Jiggling it all over the shop, you ain't messing
I wanna get closer, suppose I'd better step in
You got the kind of body I won't be forgetting
Pleasing my senses, I ain't being pretentious
There's a lot of incentive why you're being defensive
I'm a bedroom bully, let me beat it up
Stop playin, girl let me heat it up, what's up?

[Hook]

[Bridge] x2
Wind that bum bum, move that bum bum
Shake that bum bum, grind that bum bum
Let me smack it up, back it up
Let me smack it up, back it up

[Hook]
You got em falling like when you break it down
You're like a heart attack yeah
No wonder no man around you can act sane
When you're moving like that
But they don't understand that they don't got a chance
Cause I got other plans for us tonight
You got em falling like when you break it down
Cause they never seen an arse like that
Ouch!
Arse like that
Ouch!
Arse like that[Verse 1]
I'm sick and tired of running, I'm sick and tired of fronting
I just wanna be myself, I'm sick and tired of stunting
I'm sick of strangers in my life, From girl to girl I'm jumping
Don't know what I'm living for no more but I wanna die for something
There's more to the life than big bully, I'm out here tryna fight my cooling
Every day, same shit, burn the union
Cop bars from evening til morning
Sometimes still feels like I'm fooling, go up to the eye of storm
I never thought that I could be so corny
Why wasn't there nobody to warn me
Why couldn't I see the signs? How could I not read between the lines
Thought I could somehow be divine
But it feels like God left me behind
But that's not true, I'm so blessed
That's Mos Def, I'm so fresh
And I don't wanna protest but I feel so soulless, I'm a hopeless

[Hook]
It's a bad time, but I'm I until I die
That's every motherfuckin day
Real good shot for a spot at the top
Girl if I go bang bang
So bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang
Girl if I go bang bang
So bang bang bang bang bang bang motherfucker
Girl if I go bang bang
Now do it

[Verse 2]
I'm likely most conceded, but I ain't the flashy type
Can't really take the media, don't like the flashy lights
Can't stand the nosy people cause they're so full of spite
Won't let nobody judge me, I know what's wrong and right
Might have some line of addiction, I'm so cool out to the mix
I'm so full of contradiction when I spend time and money with chicks in Switzerland
And if they will go fix it
Got my foot in the shoe if it fits it
But this time I done said I'm a real good misfit, runnin around time like a dipstick
Don't watch the main so I'm clueless
Out of all and I'm ruthless
I try to hold it down but I'm useless
And I can't stand the fault, the world knows my movements
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Feels like I'm blazing, the love and the passion inside
I'm ready to flash and I'm ready to ride
I'm likin the vibe

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I work my hustles, nothing given on a silver platter
I get more money then I blow it like it doesn't matter
A bunch of stuff I'll probably never use, just booze and clatter
Don't put me on no pedestal because I'm just a rapper
And that's just me being truthful
And it hurts but it feels so beautiful
It's a lot more suitable
Don't want no blood on my chemicals
So hard to kids and hide yo wife
And please don't make me say it twice
I'm cold as ice, I'm so not nice
And I'm just out here tryna live my life

[Pre-Hook x2]
Not tryna be in a hype
But I feel so glad that I'm tryna see the light
Inside I can feel the fire
When I ignite it'll be alright

[Hook]Hey, turn the bass up
Hey, turn the bass up
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Big dirty stinking bass, dirty stinking bass
Big dirty stinking bass, dirty dirty stinking
Big dirty stinking bass, dirty stinking bass
Big dirty stinking bass, bass, bass, bass, bass

[Hook]
I don't need no speed (no)
I don't need no heroin (no thanks)
I don't want no coke (not today)
You can keep your ketamine (yeah)
I'm a bassline junkie (whaat?)
I'm a bassline junkie (tell 'em again)
I'm a bassline junkie (tell 'em again)
And I like it funky

What the fuck? What are you doing?
Don't touch it
Don't. Who told you to touch it? I will fucking kill you
Don't ever touch that fucking shit again

I'm a fiend for a big day bassline
When I hear one I have a great time
A bit of bass all what I require
I let the bassline take me higher
My friends think that it's a bad habit
But I'm just like fuck you, damn it
If you take my bass away
I'll blow your fucking face away (easy!)
You might think I'm over the top
But when I hear that bassline drop
I just can't control my actions
But I still feel satisfaction
So don't come around here whinging
I just wanna hear the bassline rinsin'
Or we can just skank out all day
If not get the fuck out my way

[Hook]

Big dirty stinking bass, dirty stinking bass
Big dirty stinking bass, dirty dirty stinking
Big dirty stinking bass, dirty stinking bass
Big dirty stinking bass, bass, bass, bass, bass

The other day I got an asbo order
And I think it's well out of order
All my neighbors throwing a fit
So I told them suck my dick
And I told them I got the power
And I turn the music up louder
All night till six in the morning
Old bastards, they just boring
You know me, I'm the bassline father
Nobody can't tell me nada
And the police turned up and they took me
We drove out to the nick and they booked me
When they said they'd give me a caution
If I didn't give them no distortion
But I said don't bother, I'm guilty
And my bassline's fucking filthy

[Hook]

Big dirty stinking bass, dirty stinking bass
Big dirty stinking bass, dirty dirty stinking
Big dirty stinking bass, dirty stinking bass
Big dirty stinking bass, bass, bass, bass, bass
Big dirty stinking bass, dirty stinking bass
Big dirty stinking bass, dirty dirty stinking
Big dirty stinking bass, dirty stinking bass
Big dirty stinking bass, bass, bass, bass, bass
Big dirty stinking bass, dirty stinking bass
Big dirty stinking bass, dirty dirty stinking
Big dirty stinking bass, dirty stinking bass
Big dirty stinking bass, bass, bass, bass, bass
Bass, bass, bass, bass
Bass, bass, bass, bassOh my word

[Hook: D Double E]
Bluku bluku, ina the informer 'ead

Bluku bluku, me left the informer dead
Runnin' tings [?] me no chat to no fed
Bluku bluku, ina the informer 'ead
Bluku bluku, buss' a shot ina the informer' leg
Bluku bluku, me left the informer dead
Runnin' tings red nah me no chat to no fed

[Verse 1: D Double E]
What yo gonna do when you hear that me and my crew are looking for you?
Knocking at your door, them the boys in blue, kidnap certain man that look like you
What yo gonna do when you hear that me and my crew are looking for you?
Knocking at your door, them the boys in blue, kidnap certain man that look
(I'm behind you)
I don't wanna hear no more talk
These boys don't know more war
Shank in the leg so you can't no more walk
Now you definitely taking the leg, blud
Who's gonna come about pure war talk?
Who wants to be outlined in chalk?
You shoulda known better, it was all your fault
Real bad man don't normally talk
Look like Skibba man, deal with the matter
Just like sicker man deal with the case
You said my niggas don't watch no face
Come to the ends, bust shells in face
I don't really wanna make it a court case
'Cos I know that you got Trident on base
You can't keep up with my pace
??? many more friends ina my space

[Hook: D Double E]

[Verse 2: Dizzee Rascal]
It's the E3 African
Ready for action and I'm the main attraction
Everybody stopping and clocking to see
How I'm holding or what I be rocking
I got the whole world jocking, chart topping
Dirty South hip-hopping with the big bass knocking
Fully thugged out, never stopping
All blacked out so the feds can't spot him, going on so rotten
It don't cease
People telling me to increase the peace
I release decrease when I reach the East
But I release the beast, I don't care
Real bare chest, no Jesus piece
I'm John the Baptiste, wetting the road up
Hold up, I showed up flinging my gold up
Blinging and winging 'em out, I leave 'em in gold dust
Said they're running the town, but nobody told us
I never got the memo, I'm sorry fellow
You're a level below, I never even said hello
You're soft like jelo, I roll hard
I go dumb but I'm far from a retard
Blackberry at my yard on recharge
IPhone in my car, that's me, star
And I stay on the ball like FIFA
Still I stay smoking the potent reefer
See ya

[Hook: D Double E]

[Verse 3: D Double E]
I'm connected to more gangs than Ross Kemp
Manchester back down to Kent
Don't draw for the leng, a hundred percent
No pussy round here blud, I can't smell a scent
If you think that then you're not thinking sense
My mandem [?]
No muscle, no need to tense
[?] bullet hole inside your ten pence
Nah, it's not me that you wanna come against
Car, whether you're small or hench
Got a big chest 'cos you love up the bench
When I release the cell you'll be losing strength
Understand I'm not talking friends
You know war with me, blud, it's too intense
I just hope your team's got good defense
Just know

[Hook: D Double E]

Bluku blukuI wake up everyday it's a daydream
Everythin' in my life ain't what it seems
I wake up just to go back to sleep
I act real shallow but I'm in too deep

And all I care about is sex and violence
A heavy bass line is my kind of silence
Everybody says that I gotta get a grip
But I let sanity give me the slip

Some people think I'm bonkers
But I just think I'm free
Man, I'm just livin' my life
There's nothin' crazy about me

Some people pay for thrills
But I get mine for free
Man, I'm just livin' my life
There's nothin' crazy about me

Bonkers

And all I care about is sex and violence

Mmm, yeah, I'm back in the floor now
Mmm, yeah, I'm back in the floor now
Mmm, yeah, I'm back in the floor now[Dizzee Rascal - Talking]
Yo, MC's better start chattin about what's really happening
Because if you ain't chatting about what's happening
Where you living? what you talking about?
Cause you know and I know it's gonna be a hot summer
And you know what it's gonna be an even hotter winter
And I ain't even talking about the weather
Dizzee Rascal, uh

[Verse - 1]
Looks like I'm losing friends there's a lot of hostility in my ends
We used to argue always make up and be friends
Now we settle disagreements with the skengs
Looks like I'm losing mates there's a lot hostility near my gates
We used to fight with kids from other estates
Now eight millimetres settle debates
Looks like I'm losing sight cause I'm looking at the future it ain't bright
So I look out my window and pray every night
I thank God for my friends but they ain't tight
Looks like I'm losing hope cause I climb this mountain without rope
But I know I'm the captain of my boat so I steadily sail and hope not to float

[Hook]
But it's a brand new day, new opportunities what can I say
I plan to make my pay but put some away for a off key day
But it's a brand new day, new opportunities what can I say
I plan to make my pay but put some away for a off key day
Demand collect, cash up front and direct
Pay money pay respect don't insult my intellect
Demand collect, cash up front and direct
Pay money pay respect don't insult my intellect

[Verse - 2]
When we ain't kids no more will it still be about what it is right now
Like fighting for anything anytime and acting without a care anywhere
And when we ain't kids no more will it still be about what it is right now
Like bank scams, street robbery, shotters plotters or H.M.P
And when we ain't kids no more will it still be about what it is right now
Pregnant girls who think they love useless mans with no plans
And when we ain't kids no more will it still be about what it is right now
Cause negative signs just keep showing up
Some of us better just start growing up

[Hook]

[Verse - 3]
When I look at my life I can't help but think
Cause I could of resorted to drugs and drink
Everyday was the same as the day before
We were never quite sure of what's in store
Every day I wake up I can't help but feel
I'm certain of life I mean this is real
Mad thoughts skip around my head like dancers
I know it's long to question but I need answers
The who's, the what's, the how's, the when's, the why's
You can at look in my face and see the pain in my eyes
Tears ready to fall like the rain in the skies
So hold back put my feet down and rise
Cause guys wanna test my words
So I can't just cater for second or third
Plus I know predators only go for the weak
And that's long so I gotta stay strong, you get me

[Hook][Verse 1]

I'm a young raggo bredder from the LDN
In my Nike Air bubbles and they cost 110
Got these beanies on my line and they all want the leng
I'm a ghetto superstar, come straight from the ends
And I walk it like I talk it, blood, I ain't just hype
Making moves for the money everyday and every night
Best to believe I keep it tight
Best to believe I'm moving right
Keep my business on the low, you best to believe I'm outta sight
I like money-money-money, girls-girls, cash-cash
I let the champagne splash
Yo, I'm not a gangbanger but I'm good with a mash
Make you scratch your head and wonder, is he really that flash?
But it really doesn't matter, cause you know I keep it moving
Middle of the dance floor, lean-up, grooving
Baby cocked her bumper out, you know I gotta wind it
When we leave the club, I'm gonna really get behind it

[Hook]

Nike Air bubbles on my feet looking fresh
And my brand-new garms on, dressed to impress
Got my phone line popping, all these beanies got a crush
Keep something in my pocket in case these bredders try and rush
Nike Air bubbles on my feet looking fresh
And my brand-new garms on, dressed to impress
Got my phone line popping, all these beanies got a crush
Keep something in my pocket in case these bredders try to rush

[Verse 2]

Brown eyes, 5'10, dark skin
I'm Mr Dizzee Rascal, why you even asking?
The undercover lover, girls call me buff ting
But used to keep a balaclava resting on my chin
And it's an ends ting, hustle-hustle, bling-bling
I'm not waiting around to hear the fat lady sing
The point of what I'm saying is the answer within
But life's a jungle, everybody wants to be the the king
But it's alright though, I got my eyes on the prize
Money in my grill, bigger picture in my eyes
Hands around my testicles, middle finger risen
Every step that I take is a step with precision
I'm precise, precisely why my future's looking nice
The penthouse is lovely, it's a shame about the price
But you only live twice, that's on the real
No matter where I am, I'll always be the real deal

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

Education starts with discipline, I'm listening
But conversations kinda muffled since I got rich n ting
Verbal turd indirectly spoke, I never heard a thing
Underground or overground, what's the difference, I'm the king
Not divine right, it's my hindsight, I see it all
Because I ain't afraid to spread my wings and fly, you're a fool
Talking like you're mighty and you're high, but I know you're small
There's no logic in your gossip, just the writings on the wall
Over-ignorant, you ain't gully, you just play thug
Far from the realest, O-Dog, Menace, you're a mug
If you're deep, why have you gotta roll 50 to the club?
Blood, who do you think you are fooling with that fake crew love?
These streets don't care for no long-term plan
These roads don't give a damn about any man
I try and show these bredders, they refuse to understand
So I'll just keep doing what I'm doing while I can, man

[Hook]Yo cuz
Whagwaan fam?
What you got there?
Oi
Is that a lemon?
No it's cheese cuzzie
Hey join me?
What I just lit it fam!
Oh don't be shy!
Fuck sake
Are you movin to my girl though?
I might do still!
She's loose bruv
Ah shutup!

CHORUS:
We're Just Chillin wiv da man dem
Jammin wiv da man dem
It's all good in the hood wiv da man dem
I know a couple girldem maybe I shall bell dem
Till then I'm just chillin wiv da man dem
Jammin wiv da man dem
It's all good in the hood wiv da man dem
I know a couple girldem maybe I shall bell dem
Till them I'm just chillin wiv da, chillin wiv da

I was in the e3vo playin pro evo
Gettin moved up in the scores for a zero
If I lose again I will surely regret it
Cuz this pussyole won't let me forget it
But it's no pressure I can take this boi
And if I don't win I'll break dis boi
I'm just rampin we've got an understandin
We could never be arms out that's ma brederin
Through thick and thin, rain sleet hail snow he's chippin in
If he's got a couple gash he'll bring me in
If he's got a bit of weed I'm smokin
I ain't jokin
From day one we was on this road ting
Now we're all grown up on the old ting
Kick back take it easy and slow ting
It's the kind of thing we're promotin
No job ting

(Chorus)

When I get lost
Feel I've been crossed
The man dem are my salvation
I take off my shoes
Fill up a zoot
And put on the playstation

So stop button bashing just pass the pad, pass the pad, pass the pad
Stop chattin shit just pass the pad, pass the pad, pass the pad
Hey no it's winner stays on blud pass the pad, pass the pad, pass the pad
Don't be a prick blud pass the pad, pass the pad, pass the pad

High talk and ghetto conspiracies
Psychotic weed dealers smokin trees
Heated arguments all about the football
We're up all night like we're nocturnal
I can't be bothered to do anything but chill
And fuck the world outside that's how I feel
I've got a whole lot of time to kill
So fuck these bitches I'm just keepin it real

(Chorus)

(Instrumental)[Intro]
Don't you know it feels?
Rocking, [?], loving...

[Hook]
Couple of stacks'll put the boys on your back
Couple of stacks'll make the ratch go click-clack
Couple of stacks'll put the boys on your back
Couple of stacks'll make the ratch go click-clack
Couple of stacks'll put the boys on your back
Couple of stacks'll make the ratch go click-clack
Couple of stacks'll put the boys on your back

I'll kill you
I'll kill everything you stand for
Cause you're a bitch and a manwhore
I'll settle the damn score and more
About my own beef, I don't care about a gang war
Ain't hard to shoot
It ain't hard to fall
So what you waiting for?
I'll break your jaw
I'll take the law into my own hands
You wanna fuck me up? I've got my own plans
Keep running your cakehole
I'll have you buried in the ground like a potato
You better lay low
Fall back when I say so
I'll have you dressed all white wearing a halo
All I really give a damn about is the pesos
I let the devil take over
Believe I'm colder
And the chip on my shoulder
Is more bigger and bolder
And I'm out of control so don't say I never told ya

(Ma'am, are you alright?)

Think I'm some kind of cunt?
Think that I won't pull some kind of stunt?
Think that I won't leave some kind of lump?
Pull out the pump like it's that time of month?
And don't think I'm some kind of monk
Or a peacemaker, a deceased hater is the best kind
Don't wanna see me go blind
Don't cross the line
Cause it's about that time

No defence, I ain't sitting on the fence
I bust a head if I really want to vent
Or I could just kick back, be a gent
Or put a price on your head
That's money well-spent
Money and an alibi
Money and an alibi
Money and an alibi
Money and an alibi

[Hook]

Stop chatting the place up
Don't mean I have to start smacking your face up
If I weren't doing this I'd be jacking the place up
Laced-up, on row, somebody's getting drapsed-up
Ready to take stuff
So pick up the pace
I stay on your case
Stacking my papes up
Keep a firm grip on the tool
I never break up
And I stand tall, I'm cool
I can never shake up

Feeling foolish if you raise up
A pool of blood, you got blazed-up
You got ahead of yourself
Just steady yourself
And you think you're heavy
But your really not ready
Just settle yourself
I suggest you fix up
If you skitz out it'll all be tits-up
R.I.P. you don't wanna get ripped-up and zipped-up
All cause you're running your lips up
Don't bother getting a mix up
Just stay in your lane
I'm fucked in the head
That's the way of my brain
And I'm insane
We ain't the same
So refrain from chatting my name for capital gain
Cause this ain't a game
When you're dead
They'll say it's a shame
Talking 'bout all you could have been if you weren't slain
And you've only got yourself to blame
So forget the fame
If you think I just entertain

No defence, I ain't sitting on the fence
I bust a head if I really want to vent
Or I could just kick back, be a gent
Or put a price on your head
That's money well-spent
Money and an alibi
Money and an alibi
Money and an alibi
Money and an alibi

[Hook minus the last line]I socialize and negotiate (review the situation) [x3]
Now cut 'em off

[Hook: repeat x4]
Review the situation, take part, take over

[Verse 1]
My name is Raskit, listen to my flow
I socialize in Hackney and Bow
I wear my trousers ridiculously low
I love females, money and creps

I'm kind of streetwise, I think that you should know
You're not a bad boy, you're putting on a show
You talking bad, creeping up on Roscoe
So keep creep crawling cause I'm taking bigger steps

My name is Raskit, listen to my slang
I socialize with the crew and the gang
Road youth, on the streets is where I hang
I'll make you collapse, leave gaps in your face

You're in your neighborhood thinking that you're nang (ho please)
You got your people thinking that I'm done (ho please)
But if you try it, I'll make the ratchet bang
You could never outplay me, I'm an ace

I'm not a smoker but I blaze a lot (uh huh)
Sit around puffing, waste my days a lot
And though I shouldn't waste time, cause I ain't got a lot
I'm just lazy (yeah)

I'm not a rachet but I bang a lot
Got a couple beanies that I slam a lot
I'll make 'em happy with my fingers on my hand a lot
I'm just crazy

[Hook intro: repeat x2]
Socialize, Negotiate, and cut 'em off, we cut 'em off

[Hook]

(Do you know what street is?)

[Verse 2]
There you go again talking like a div (shit)
Like I can't find out where you live (why its easy)
Kick off your latch, I don't even need a ratch (click)
My butterfly leave you looking like a sieve

I've met bad boys from every postcode
You could never talk to me about road
Stop dreaming, I'm your worst nightmare (yeah)
I'm Freddy Krueger, make the Luger explode

Now there you go again talking like a star
Like I can't find out where you par
Kick off your door, I ain't got a 4-4, bruh
I'll have to settle for a long metal bar

I've met bad boys from every rough ends
You could never talk to me about skengs (click click)
You talk tough, but you ain't sayin' much
I'll chop you up and share you out between your friends

Now some love me, some do the opposite
If you feel to move to me, please get on with it
Don't know why you feel the need to talk to birds
But talk is dangerous, be careful with your words (yo)

And just remember this, I am you
So if you think you're real, do what you gotta do
On the level, you're just challenging yourself
So if you're feeling brave, go ahead and hurt yourself

[Hook Intro]

[Hook][Verse 1]

Summer in the city such a very special time
If you put aside the traffic, air-pollution and the grime
You'll be pleased to be reminded that the girls are looking fine
And apart from money that's the only thing that's on my mind
Short skirts, belly-tops, fake tans
String-vests with the bra underneath for the mans
Getting hard off of half of a glimpse, I got plans
To be scooping up a couple of buff tings if I can
If I can't then I'm still live
I'll go and check my little yatty by the seaside
Cause I know she's live, plus she's a delight
She gives me hospitality, she treats me right
That's what I need, right?
And if not, I'm on a little mission to Los Angeles
To check my Beverly Hill honey to see if she can handle this
Pimping ain't no easy thing and some of these chicks are scandalous
But I'm a player and I say I gotta be the man for this
I love it!

[Interlude]

You won't believe some of the shit I've seen, man
Trust me
Yo, I ain't even gonna go through it
But differently I wanna send out a shout out to all my people out there, yeah
Big shout to the man dem, the ladies
You know you gotta put in your grind if you wanna get what you really want out of life
Trust me, you only get one run

[Verse 2]

I don't believe in fate
Life is what you make it, make it great
I'm trying to elevate, concentrate on getting my paper straight
Survive the great escape, from the ends I used to congregate
Until I could no longer wait, I had to find a purpose
Otherwise I would've been worthless, making fuss on the estate
Ignorant to what the earth is offering when I should take
Every chance and every opportunity to try and make
Every second and every breath of life something to celebrate
So I've been around the world now, rose to the occasion
Boast different folks, different strokes, black, white and Asian
All these ladies look incredible, still got me gazing
Riding jet-skis and powerboats, feel so amazing
Club-hopping in Ibiza, I've got Pacha on lock
Pull up right outside the entrance in a Hummer, people clock
Then they stop, stare and wonder who I am and who I'm not
I just take it in my stride, but I ain't never felt this hot
And I love it, love it

[Interlude]

It's all good man, ya get me?
Yo, you know you gonna catch me out Ibiza again, yeah
I gotta go there again
Get the Hummer out
We're driving down the streets knocking down motorbikes, it's nothing
Turn up at the club
Girls everywhere
It's all vibes though, man
Yo, big shout to my man like Paddy, yeah
Hang tight Shy FX - you done know!
Big up Cajun
Yeah man, I gotta big up the man like Scope
Big shout to T-Power, yeah
Hang tight Alexis, yeah
Yo, Dirtee Skank's the label, man
Maths + English, live by it
London city stand up
It's a UK thing, what[Verse 1: Dizzee Rascal]
What's up darlin'?
I been keeping my eye on your movement
I can't see no room for improvement
Why you all over there in your jack jones?
You need to let me get behind your backbone
Cause I'm the man for the job, let me work it
I won't waste no time, I'll make it worth it
One hundred percent, I'll make it worth it
You got a body to die for, let me merk it
Now it's murder on the dance floor
I wanna take this further than the dancefloor
I ain't forceful but I'm still hardcore
You're gonna give me everything I ask for
It's not a long ting, you're a boom ting
Maybe more than a hotel room ting
I'll never know if I just walk past
I really wanna dance so I guess I'll just ask

[Pre-Hook: Chrom3 (Dizzee Rascal)]
She ain't no ho
Look at those thighs, it's in her eyes
She's good to go
She can satisfy my mind, body and soul
(Come and dance wiv me)

[Link: Dizzee Rascal]
I see you glance at me
That's why I'm asking B
So let's party B
Come and dance wiv me

[Hook: Calvin Harris]
If I'm out on my own
Then I can look at you looking at me
If I'm out on a date
Then I just shut my eyes, then I can't see
Get away from the bar
Tell your boyfriend hold your jar
And dance wiv me

[Link]

[Verse 2: Dizzee Rascal]
Yo, it goes on and on
I see you get excited like this is my song
You think I wanna get involved
You are not wrong
Cause I been waiting for this moment all night long
So I creep, creep creep back to your seat
I got my left eye checking out your scenery
I got my right eye right where it needs to be
Don't matter how I look at it
You look good to me
Still, I'm looking for the perfect view
The way I see it, that's right next to you
I know you've probably heard it before but still
I love it when you flex like that for real
So don't stop doing what you do when you do it
I just wanna be a part of it when you do it
I'll feel like a wally if I don't pursue it
And I can't go through it
So let's get to it

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Bridge: Dizzee Rascal]
I know you didn't come out to stand and stare
You bought new shoes and you did up your hair
You made a real effort tonight and it shows
I can tell by your face you don't wanna be alone
Cause the mood is right and the time is now
And if you can't do it I'll show you how
All you gotta do is get loose, let go
Just throw a couple shapes
Put your skills on show, oh

[Hook x2][Refrain]
Money talks, listen, mmm-hmm-hmm, money talks
Dirty cash I want you, dirty cash I need you, woh-oh
Money talks, money talks
Dirty cash I want you, dirty cash I need you, woh-oh

[Verse 1]
Let's Go
Everybody wants to be famous
Nobody wants to be nameless, aimless
People act shameless
Tryna live like entertainers
Want a fat crib with the acres
So they spend money that they ain't made yet
Got a benz on tik that they ain't paid yet
Spend their pay cheque
In the west end on the weekend
Got no money by the end of the weekend
But they don't care cause their life is a movie
Starring Louis V, paid for by yours truly
Truthfully, it's a joke, like a bad episode of hollyoaks
Can't keep up with the cover notes
So they got bad credit livin' on direct debit
In debt but they still don't get it
Cause they too busy livin' the high life, the night life
Lovin' the high when livin' it large
And they all say

[Refrain]

[Verse 2]
Let me take you down to London city
Where the attitude's bad and the weather is shitty
Everybody's on a paper chase
It's one big rat race
Everybodys got a screw face
So many 2 face
Checkin their high just like their ready to ride
I'm on the inside looking at the outside
So it's an accurate reflection
City wide, north, east, west and the southside
Everywhere I go there's a goon on the corner
Guns and drugs cause the citys like a sauna
And it's getting warmer, and out of order
Tryna put a struggling mother to a morner
Mr polititian can you tell me the solution
What's the answer, what's the conclusion
Is it an illusion, is it I'm a thug
I see younger die because they tryna live large
And they all say

[Bridge]
I've no excuse, I just want you to use me
Take me and abuse me
I got no taboos, I'll make a trade with you
Do anything you wa-ant me to

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
Yo, we're living in the days of the credit crunch
Give me the dough, I'm trying to have a bunch
But I can't have raps for lunch
It's nothing, enough to share, it ain't fair
I never dreamed that it could be rare

Who cares who's there to make a change?
Everyone's in the club tryna to make it rain
But not for famine, just for the sake of having
Fifteen minutes of fame and everywhere's the same

Again and again, I see the same thing
Everybody acting like they're plain sailing
But I see rough seas ahead, maybe a recession
And then the depression, then whatever profession

This is my confession, I can't front, I'm in the forefront
Livin' for money ready to start like a bungee jump
With no rope, but I ain't tryna see the bottom
Because that is where I came from, I ain't forgotten

[Refrain][Dizzee Rascal - Talking]
Oh, It's real out here like no one understands sometimes
If people could see what's really going on
Like people are just, just going mad in front of me, you get me
Everyone's growing up too fast, I swear
Feds don't understand us, adults don't understand us
No one understands us
We just live do what we do like, It's real
It's Raskit, shout out to all the mandem
Yo, I'm repping I'm trying listen, Yo

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I wake up wishing I could sleep forever
I spend my whole life tryna' pull myself together
Tryna' reassure myself that I ain't going mad
I've gotta come to a conclusion, it's now or never
Sometimes I wake up wishing I could sleep for years
I've been through anger, pain, blood sweat and tears
You'd think that any kid in my position would be glad
Quite the opposite; more worries more fears
Sometimes I wake up wishing I could sleep for days
It's like I've lost the love, I'm only in it cause it pays
I find myself back on road, things are getting bad
More and more I'm going back to my old ways
Sometimes I wake up wishing I could sleep for good
And if I had the guts to end it all, believe I would
It's getting boring always being miserable and sad
Shit I would love to be polite, I really wish I could
But life's pressures often get me down
Sometimes I feel there's not a lot to smile about so I frown
And I talk a big whole heap of badness
Because my life's a big whole heap of madness
I've seen a lot, maybe more than I can take
Under pressure everyday trying not to break
But I'll survive cause it's what I do best
I'm a challenger put me to the test

[Hook - 2X]
Sleep tight, everything will be alright
By the end of the night will be the day, just
Pray that you see it, strong you gotta be it
If you wanna get through it, stretch your mind to the limit
You can do it

[Verse 2]
It's almost like I've got the world on my shoulders sometimes
Yo I struggle sometimes, you know I'm hating petty crimes
But we live in hard times
No one to turn to and no one to talk to
Life's like a doorway, everybody walk through
Everybody's talking but nobody's listening
Everyday some new shit, week out and week in
All this negativity, why you tryna' get at me
All up in my life, rahhh where do you get the energy?
I don't feel well, but you still bother me
You're giving me a headache man, you might as well just clobber me
Blud lately I've been lonely, but you only phone me
When you want a favour then you wonder why I'm moany
Don't really ask much so I don't owe much
Don't receive a lot of love, so I don't show much
But the little that I do I put it in this song for you
Handle your business cause I do, listen

[Hook - 2X]How am I gonna pull this off man without sounding dumb?
This is too sensible for me man
How you gonna have a dream come true?

[Verse 1]
I used to dream about crazy little things like fame
In the days hanging outside the off-licence
We used to run around the streets, reckless with no shame
Mainly up to no good, a whole world of nonsense
And when the girls would walk by we would try to catch their eye
And if they didn't show face we would act immature
Had a thing for south and Hackney girls since I was a kid
A couple of west girls on my radar I was raw
And I was dead sure that I knew it all
The whole world against me attitude, I nearly blew it all
I find it a real big struggle gettin' through it all
I swear I didn't wanna listen cause I sure didn't care
Not knowing for reality, I'd have to prepare
Cos money don't grow on no stick, well it's rare
Me and boy was still looking less and less the lick
Plus I was growing up, life was looking like a scare

[Hook]
Happy talky talky happy talk
Talk about things you like to do
You got to have a dream
If you don't have a dream
How you gonna have a dream come true?

[Verse 2]
I used to love music, it was like my hidden hobby
But I couldn't get on on local radio back then
So I went to North London, I trot to Tottenham to be precise
And got some air time on Heat FM
Then it escalated, I was getting ratings here and there
And carried on until eventually I was everywhere
I started doing all the hot spots, Ministry, Caesar's Palace, P area time in MV
I did the grim and the glam
I did the poor and the posh
I didn't hang around, I wanted my money in a rush
Mind frame in the studio at this stage
No time to chat, I didn't wanna N-gage
I found myself a new hustle it was beautiful
And unlike the one before, a bit more suitable
The more challenging it got, the more I fought it
Made an album, over 100,000 people bought it
Thank you

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
To all the youngers cotchin' on the stairs in the flats
With the superstar soccer-lings, Beckham in the makings
You can go far if you put your mind to it
You're a star, don't wait to be told, just do it
Try to keep school in your plans don't be worrying about your mans
They'll be there in the end if they're real, if they ain't
Don't be making no effort to impress
Cause you'll find out where you are, just do what you feel
Young babymothers, yo I got your back as well
Young babyfathers, hold it down for your girl
I ain't trying to preach but for what it's worth
That kid's the next generation Planet Earth
Big shout to the world cause I've been all around
And when I'm gone I'm always thinking about my hometown
I'm from the LDN there's no forgetting that
And the big UK I stay reppin' that

[Hook]

You love that
You tell me you don't love that[Intro]
I ain't on a hype ting
Just out here trying to do the right thing
And even though you know I don't mind fighting
When I will, it's cash money like lightning
You know I (gotta get that dough) I ain't ramping
(Gotta get that dough) damn right
(Gotta get that dough) I ain't ramping
(Gotta get that dough) straight up

[Verse 1]
Hot taste, charisma, stylie, we got plenty
Cruising in the Punto on the way to Bentley
Evidently far from gently eating up the roll
We act immaturely in a hurry to be old
In fact we'll leave you poorly, catch a beating like a cold
Go ahead profile and flex like you're big, bad and bold
Go ahead go round your next to get hit, had and showed
Stay out the paper chase, floppy fellas fold
Neglect the rules, respect the codes, follow the guide lines
Life's been ugly so far but these are fine times
I write below the belt, I bust average fine rhymes
I always had to be a star, my city saw the signs
I try not to be stupid with my fame
But constantly I sense fassies being clever with my name
Indirectly call my name like they're calling my bluff
So sadly I often sense the need to get rough

[Hook]
I'm here, there, I'm everywhere, I can't be seen
I'm all over, ya nahmean?
I'm here, there, I'm everywhere, I can't be seen
It's all over, ya nahmean?
I'm here, there, I'm everywhere, I can't be seen
I'm all over, ya nahmean?
I'm here, there, I'm everywhere, I can't be seen
So move over, ya nahmean?

[Verse 2]
Full of strife, that's life, deal with how bad it is
Reminisce, reflect, revise on how bad it could have been
Abuse time and find out how mad it is
Time waits for nobody, handle your biz
Extortionists would love to man-handle this
I'm ignorant, refuse to understand what extortion is
Jack me and get what? Jack me and get where?
Get zilch times zero, times nothing plus air
Yeah, I'm way beyond care
Hate me or love me, try not to stare
Your thoughts and your opinions try not to share
I show interest on an occasion that is rare
Plus I ain't in the hype, I'm above it and I cause it
Can't put a stop to the track but I can pause it
So play your role, act tough, put on your show
I'll let the ratchet be your audience, bullets will applaud it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
My name is Dizzee Dizz, I handle my biz
My spreaders talking gangsta, don't know what a gangsta is
They ain't ready yet, I don't claim a set
But if you test I'll leave you with something you will regret
I'm 5'10", slim, chocolate skin
I'll punch you in your nostrils, I'll punch you in your chin
But I ain't mad, I'm a lovely lad
I'll give you the loveliest beating that you've ever had
Rude boy, home boy better chill
You know I don't watch no face cause I'm real
I don't care if you're sick, I don't care if you're ill
My foot will add a nice frill to your ice-grill
Son dun-duddy, I don't find shit funny
If you ever try and go against the flow of my money
Word is bond, what's really good, I'm really hood
Take this song as a caution, you really should

[Hook]

[Outro]
Try copy we
Hit her with the G, condo energy
Lyrical tank, lyrical pedigree
Bastard or wee on girl Emily
How bad they wanna try copy we?
Hit them with the G, condo energy
Lyrical tank, lyrical pedigree
Dizzee Rascal from the big LD
(Hey yo)
(Do you hear me?)
(Hey yo) (do you hear me?)
(Gotta get that dough)
(Gotta get that dough)
(Gotta get that dough) (Hey yo)
(Gotta get that dough)[ Hook ]
Sometimes I think the whole world's gone crazy
The shit I see, it don't cease to amaze me
I get baffled everytime I try and suss it
And now I've had enough, so excuse me please, fuck it

[ Verse 1 ]
Can somebody tell me what this world's about
Can somebody tell me what this life's about
I just can't work it out
No sense, no logic, I can't get a grip of it
I do my best to understand it but I've never got it
I watch the people slug it out and struggle in the system
But the end result's the same whether a Muslim or a Christian
There's so much hate in the world we're fighting, what are we fighting for?
When the rich keep getting richer and the poor keep getting ignored
Lord

[ Hook 2x ]

[ Verse 2 ]
I took it there and now it's time to take it further
If a policeman kills somebody, is that policeman still a murderer?
He's got a worthy cause, I guess that gives him some immunity
Or is he just another lost soul in our community?
To take a life's a serious thing and only God can judge it
Would he look at it like it's for the safety of the public?
And if you don't wanna pay the price you really shouldn't thug it
I know I am playing with fire but fuck it, I love it
Cause

[ Hook 2x ]

Fuck it, ya get me?
I don't give no...
Is it me?
It must just be me
You know, know what I mean?
There's no point even going through it, man
It is the fuck what it is, I guess
You know what I mean?
Fuck it!

[ Verse 3 ]
Who's in charge of the stupid place?
I wanna punch his stupid face
Yeah, it ain't right but it's a shame
Gotta be someone I can blame
Someones gotta have answers, someone's written a masterplan
Cause I can't see no sign of God's involvement, this has gotta be man
So much madness in the world
So much evil and confusion
But there's so much good as well
So there's got to be some solution
So that means there must be hope
Maybe room for revolution
So that means there must be hope
Maybe room for revolution

[ Hook 2x ]

Fuck it, ya get me?
Shout to my people out there
Wonderin what it is really all about
I guess we'll never know
Unless you really wanna know
Maths & English, stupid
Yeah!
Dirtee Stank, what![Hook x2]
Fix up look sharp
Don't make me get the blitz out get dark
Hear the bang, see the spark
Duck down, lay down just
I got the big beat
I hear the sound
I got the big beat, Dizzee Rascal
I get on down rolling deep

[Verse 1]
I've heard the gossip from the street to the slammer
They're trying to see if Dizzee stays true to his grammar
Being a celebrity don't mean shit to me
Fuck the glitz and glamor
Hit em with the Blitz and Hammer
Because they're talking bout rushing
Talk behind my back but to my face they say nothing
Stand up in the dance, keep a firm steady stance
Keep the beanies touching, keep the beanies hot flushing
Flushing MC's down the loo
If you don't believe me bring your posse, bring your crew
Feel free to hate cos I ain't tryna be your mate
Be serious, you wouldn't last an hour in my shoe
It's an Air Force One
Trainers by the truck load, trainers by the ton
Don't be dazed when I catch you by your J's
Chump, best to act like Forest Gump, best to run

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I stay sweet as a nut, sweet like Tropicana
When the hammer hits, your head splits like banana
You're not ready for this boy
You better send your best soldiers, this is Captain Roscoe
More destructive and troublesome than ever
I'll probably be doing this, probably forever
Fellas wanna stop me they'll probably come together
Its probable they'll stop me, probably never
Yo topboy, topman, or top a topper
Come to me with an attitude, come a cropper
I'm old school like Happy Shopper
I fight old school, bring your bat and your chopper
And a First Aid kit and some antiseptic, this could get hectic
I'm a don accept it, you gotta bright future
Don't let my gun affect it

[Hook x2]I wanna see you dip-dip-dip
And lemme see you rock-rock-rock
And wind up on your hip-hip-hip
And never ever stop-stop-stop

I wanna see you dip-dip-dip
And lemme see you rock-rock-rock
And wind up on your hip-hip-hip
And never ever stop-stop-stop

[ Hook ]
I love it when you flex like that
Slow, fast, up, down, bring it back
I love it when you move like that
Slow, fast, up, down, bring it back

I love it when you wind like that
Slow, fast, up, down, bring it back
I love it when you flex like that
Slow, fast, up, down, bring it back

[ Verse 1 ]
I love it when I see a pretty girl winding
I can even watch a buttaz girl grinding
Control the body with great timing
Ain't shy in the dance, they're shining
Does something to me when I see 'em vibesing
Drop it like its hot, they got my tings rising
So frequent there's no disguising
What do you expect, that ain't surprising
These girls get my blood pressure rising
Their wiggling and jiggling, I'm hyping
Shaking their back off, it's so inviting
So natural, so exciting
Yo, to be honest, I wanna get right in
It's better than with the man dem fighting
No point in wishing, I might as well try a ting
Excuse me, I really gotta say something

[ Hook ]

[ Verse 2 ]
Girlfriend, how you wind like that?
Beautiful, you look so fine like that
Ain't seen it for a long time like that
You should go to jail for a crime like that
Buss' up the floor, you don't cut no slack
Dancehall queen, you're not at all laid-back
Make up for what all the other girls lack
Look so good you got me going off tr-tr-track
I can't even chat, got my heartbeat going rat-a-tat-tat
So serious, you got me ill like that
Temperature rising yo, I feel like that
Nah for real, you could kill like that
Moving your body with pure skill like that
I can't get enough yo, it's real like that
I'd love if you'd flex with Dill like that
Cause

[ Hook ]

[ Bridge ]
Ok, alright
Let's dance all night
Alright, ok
Let's dance all day
Ok, alright
Let's dance all night
Alright, ok
Let's dance all day

[ Verse 3 ]
Gosh golly, my-oh-my
I'm hoping that you ain't looking at any other guy
Your figure is so pleasing to the eye
Especially when you do the bogle or the butterfly
See a bit of sweat dripping down your thigh
But somehow you still stay high-and-dry
Gosh, you make a rude boy so shy
Got the whole club saying my-oh-my
Please don't stop, please don't stop, give it
If not, show me how I gotta get with it
You're the best I ain't scared to admit it
I swear I care, I won't dare pet with it
What's the deal, you're looking at me like, is it?
But you won't know unless you come pay a visit
Life's too short to be cautious, innit?
Don't just stand on the edge, come live it
