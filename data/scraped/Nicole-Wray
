[Nicole Wray: Hook]
I’d never do it again
Do it again
I’d never do it again
Cuz this is the end
This is the end
This is the end
I’d never do it again(hey)
Do it again (hey)
I’d never do it again (hey)
Cuz this is the end

[Verse 1: GLC]
My brother told me a long time ago
Don't focus where you been, G, focus where you tryna go
I swear the game make you cold like abominable snow man
Old man when you trying to shine like gold
When its my time to blow partner I'mma know
In the midst of getting dough I was here with highs and low
My Melo tried to play me like my fucking eyes was closed
Now im sittin here wishing that my guys didn’t know
They love a G, so they despise a soul
What they gon’ do to him, beyond my control
When the reaper calls, it's your time to go
Never play a nigga when you see that he is trying to grow
I'm Benny Blanco when he knocked out Carlito
And pachanga so im watching every angle
Under the moonlight with the devil I tangoed
Church on the move like Jesus in the manger
Better control the money, its better to control the anger
So now I watch a friend the way *that* I watch a stranger

[Hook]

[Verse 2: King Chip]
Chilling rolling up something to change my feeling
Thinkin about how I came up from nothing while i’m
Splitting this cigarillo, phone rings I get a call
One of my dogs tripping hard talkin about really killin them all
I say slow down, slow down
What the fuck you mean nigga
Just ran to your crib and popped your daughter in the spleen
I’ll be there in 20 minutes, but it only took fifteen
We wasn’t that tight but cool enough for me to hit the scene
No knowing this was all a set up
Secretly they want me wet up
Jealous of my future cheddar, however
They fastest move was too slow for me
I pulled up, wasn’t no ambulance, there wasn’t no police
Something fishy going on, naive kept pressing on
Nine gripped thinking the killer could still be on the lawn
Opened the front door they shot, I shot, some abrupt shit
The nigga with something to lose almost lost it, won't trust him again

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kid Cudi]
Cheese came through at 3
Salute at ease he supplied the weed
Cause Ibn had OD
Its me with a black rockstar steez
Real rock tees, $300 a pop for these
Please, bummy? You don’t owe me money
Day & Nite got flipped and I got blow for a grip
Sipping on a Heinie with my Jamie boo besides me
That's my fucking best friend
When I be tweaking she be calming a brother
Like the touch from a mother
I am so damn comfortable I never want to leave it
The feeling is something like a spiritual healer
That could end me, I think that’s the part I find intriguing
A little bit off I am, I am, I am
I see that im caught I am, I am, I am
It’s something like a spiritual healer that could end me
I think thats the part I find intriguing, im fiending

[Nicole Wray: Outro]
I’ll never do it again
Do it again[Missy]
Don't explain, you never change
Same old thing, same old game
Say ya want to be wit' me
But show me my ring
Baby, let me think

The story untold, about to unfold
How do you expect me
To ever believe you want be wit' me

[Missy]
Talk is talk, and talk is cheap
Tell it to her, don't say it to me
Cuz I know I'm in control
See Trix are for kids, and boo I'm too old
Go 'head, with your games
Don't ever come back to me again
Where you go, remember me
I'm the best thing in history

[Missy] (Nicole)
Why you all in my grill (Why, why, why)

[Big Boi]
Aight, uh
Why you all in my grill?
I'm thinkin' it's time to chill
Yeah, but you on a drill, though
I couldn't even step out the baby blue Bonneville
Cuz you be tryin' to kill my ho, my girlfriend
And people around me is tellin' me that you's a stalker
Like Darth Vader takes a Skywalker
I told you I was the street talker
It ain't my fault you dirty your Victoria's Secret's
And your Frederick's
You wanted the Waldorf Astoria
But instead I took you to Cedric's, to entertain you
To give you to the "G", and never claim you
Me and Missy, we get it straight pissin'
Oh yeah, we puffin' on one of them thangs too
You blamin' who? You namin' who?
I know you ain't bringin' that lame crew
Big Boi, Daddy Fat Sax
She pretty D, all they same, boo
But I'm backed by the Dungeon Family
So you can go 'head wit' all that stabbin' me
Cuz I will jab thee, and slam thee
And Bobby Boochet yo' ass, G
Yeah, yeah[Verse 1: Missy]
Don't explain, you never change
Same old thing, same old game

Don't ever come back to me again

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Third time: I moved you in, took you back in my life

[Verse 3: MC Solaar]
Zigzag zigzag, oui, j'ai du zigzaguer
De comète en planète ta salopette rosagué
Shoot dans des canettes, quand y'a plus d'bisous
Plus d'baisers, plus d'bises
Juste un biz-biz de bijoux
Tu veux du cling-cling clinquant, Louis Vuitton ? pas q'ça !
Top du top, rien qu'ca, plus Merco Classe A
Je braquerai les banques, toutes, puis ferai banqueroute
Boufferais des casse-croûtes juste pour paver d'or ta route
J'jouerais à cache-cache pour trouver l'cash
Userais de la kalash, de la tchatche, j'vendrais même du hash
Taulard puis jet-set, clean, honnête et net
T'offrira des tas d'poupées pleines de p'tites pépètes
J'aurai les poches vides (vides), porterai l'même jean (jean)
Lèverai mon verre à la tienne, tu diras tchin-tchin
T'auras tout ce que sur terre le soleil fait briller
Joueras au Monopoly uh, avec des vrais billets

[Verse 4: Missy]
If you want me, where's my dough
Give me money, buy me clothes
No need for talking, have my dough
Where's my money, where's my clothes

[Hook][Intro - Cam'ron]
Ayo, I never claim to hard, tough, no homo, gangsta, none of the above
Just a kid from 140th and Lenox Ave, Harlem USA
Trying to make his way in the world, ya heard?
You know in the trials and tribulations that life brings
I lost some friends, incarcerated, some are gone forever
You know you can't expect everything from everybody
So get up, get out and get something
That's what I did

[Verse 1]
Before I had the hammer cocked or Santana rocked
Little Jerv, Grandpa Terry, Grandma Dot
Uncle Carl, Uncle Ted, Uncle Steve, Uncle Bill
Cousin Steve, Cousin Bill up on the hill, now
My Aunt Normy, I don't speak to my Aunt Dida
Or my Cousin Bathsheba; love my mother, Frederica
Neighbor Freda, daughter Raven and Nicka
Down another doorbell was that nigga Wardnell
He gave birth to the best MC you never heard
Leather after leather and was clever with whatever words
Derek Armstead, Bloodshed from C.O.C
He did damage, road managed by G-O-D
A.k.a. DukeDaGod, he was stupid hard
Sixteen, a bitch dream, had stupid cars
Cutlass 68', hooptie 75'
Still drive some bullshit, I don't know why
I love the nigga though, for him put Cris' in the air
First one dis 'em in here, I swear I'll risk my career
That's a fact, dick; ain't talking no rap shit
I'm talking that Mac clip, niggas will back-flip
Act sick; my dude studied the Sabbath
No beef, veggie nigga, maybe some catfish
He could have my house, he could keep my Mauri's
He could drive my cars, this a Eastside Story

That's why my dudes love me, I let them do them
You either gon' be rich or famous fucking with me...probably both
If you happen to brush shoulders with me by accident, play Lotto
9 out of 10 times you gonna win, nigga

[Hook - Nicole Wray]
Play the game, sure to win
They all up on me, know they wants my ends
I sacrifice, I roll the dice
I love my hood, I love my life

[Verse 2]
See, a boss I'm prepared to be
When I walk away from a confrontation
I ain't scared of you, I'm scared of me
I got a gun - you don't, so if flares you'll see
After that, a five-thousand volt chair for me
So I move carefully; niggas don't care for me
Who care? I don't; you share, I won't
Calm down, breathe again
I don't do extortion unless I'm on the receiving end
Talk to my money, first time I heard her speak
That's word to me, told me I deserved to eat
Moved to a killer Ave, right from a murder street
Rocked Adidas Forums, even though they hurt my feet (that's fucked up)
I don't look in the sky, never mind stars
Know some fine stars right behind bars
Snags, Black, Doe on house arrest
Zeek, Sheek, won't even throw out the rest
They wanted my ass, right along side Zeek
Turn myself in? Nope, play hide and go seek
I'm gone, put the clip in the chrome
Yeah, I'm just like a fly, see the shit that I'm on?
And hour after hour, I would chill at the after hours
Where they flash the powder, no bath or shower
In that same spot, realized math is power
So I point at the mansion that is ours[Mocha]
But uh anyway
You could catch me any day
Sipping Hennessey
And my peeps get plenty way
But anyways, to see that I hold this dough
Cats fake it
I made it
I told you so
Mocca late kid
We no play
Stress free, sexy and Montego Bay
It's a pity that
Yall look like idiots
Yo boo let me know when I should rip this cat

[Nicole Ray- Verse 1]
My man he don't call me anymore
He don't even cares
Damn right, this fool
What must I do
To keep him loving me
All this love I give
That ain't cool

1-  I got what you want (got what you want)
I got what you need (got what you need)
Can I get another shot
This time I'ma make it hot
(repeat x 2)

[Nicole Ray - Verse 2]
Call while I'm at the crib
He turned off his phone
Said to call him back
Why silly me
Why didn't I suspect
He was making love
To someone else
Boy you killing me

[Repeat 1]

Oh yeah (x 4)

[Repeat 1]
[Missy Elliott]
I'm sitting on the side of the curb
With a pocket of herb
I don't know if yall heard
I'm high as a bird
I can fly like Kelly
I can glide like skates
Me with no Timbalands
Is like Puff with no Mase
Wait , hold up
Wait a minute, what you say
Back it up, give me space
Who that, Nicole Ray
By the way, DJ, better play all day
Make the whole world say "Damn they suckem nay"
Yo yo yo
Yeah this been kinda junk
That be making everybody wanna bop their heads
Haters, lovers, whatever
Nicole Ray
Timbaland
Mag-a-noo
Aaliyah
Ginuwine
Missy
Playa

[Repeat 1 (with Timbaland repeating Nicole Ray)](Verse 1 - NOE)

Yeah, ha!
Black Keys
What up!
Y'all gotta put yo hands up!

Yeah I settle back into the breeze
Get my cracker barrel on and focus on the cheese
Cheddar come, cheddar go, cheddar spend
I'm showin up in Heaven with a knock, let us in

The airport, the four point Sheraton
Holdin fifty G's in the duffel for a friend
He better come get it , a friend is a friend
But if the hunger pain win than he better come with it

I done did it
The game in the critic
Puttin' diesel out like the Chronicles of Riddick
Im acidic when the cigar is litted
I'm the best of my pedigree, all things considered
I can't count all the goons outfitted in arraignments and secret indicts to outwit it
I'm still swampy
Bitches still want me
The impact I had on the block
It still haunts me
So many beards in the game going grey
The body wanna rest put the brain wanna stay

Streets ain't a place, it's a thought
Can't make long money when niggas tempers is short
I can guarantee you lose with a short fuse
But I can guarantee a mink when you think

(Hook - Nicole Wray)

You done did it
You done did it
You done did it
You want some more?

You done did it
You done did it
You done did it
You want some more?

(Verse 2 - NOE)

Damn I'm seein' niggas in my sleep
Same ones who helped me trap figures in the street
From the spirit and beyond, they agree
Wealth has a cover price
Death is the fee
I thought clear when I was younger bout the dime
But the appetite for money tends to navigate the mind
I knew smart well
Structured a new cartel
They gave me that new car smell
Vain, with a deep sharp pain
OGs dubbin me the street muck queen
Pokerface in the middle of a drop off
Keep tellin' me he good keep my socks on
I'm in a rush, show the money like Maguire
Or get your ass nestled in the trunk like a tire
Situations is dire I'm not a new buyer
Get it or you can feel the Cannon like Mariah

(Hook - Nicole Wray)

You done did it
You done did it
You done did it
You want some more?
I swear you got me down

You done did it
You done did it
You done did it
You want some more?
I swear you got me down

(Verse 3 - NOE)

You niggas joke with your money
Sit up in your mans crib and smoke with your money
Like everythings chummy
Ok, well we'll take yours and we live like the Pope with your money
Thats funny, get ghost with your money
And bring the game a whole new approach with your money
See you nigges rather boast with your money
And see how many bitches you can grope with your money
I sell you a jewel, never let the money overrule, cause it
Rules over life and the doom
Clean with the vest, I stress, invest
A drug dealers dream is a dream nonetheless
Yeah I settled back into the beat
With the ratchet stickin out the cracks in the seat
Now back in the street
My young boys are askin to eat
Tough guy you ain't lastin' a week[Nicole Wray] + (Cam'Ron)
Boy you should know that (What)
I got you on my mind (Ok)
Your secret admire (Uh Huh)
I've been watching you boy (Killa)

[Hook - 2X]
At night I think of you (dipset dipset)
I want to be ya lady baby
If ya game is on give me a call boo (Call Me Up)
If ya love is strong gotta give my all to you (Holla At Me)

[Verse 1:Nicole Wray] (Cam'Ron)
Everyday I pray my heart can win (Word)
Everynight I pray I can call you my man yeah yeah yeah (Ok)
I need you (Need me?)
I want you (Want me?)
Have you hold you squeeze you (Ok)
So I'm going out (When?) every weekend (Why?) just to see my boo again {Ok Ok}

[Hook]
At night I think of you (dipset dipset)

Tough guy you ain't lastin' a week[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
B-B-B-Bouncing off the walls like a round ball, Spalding
Spinning off the rims no baskets falling
Just another basket case stricken with the lonelies
Invoke the man, out through the tenderoni
Wouldn't leave the children, left a little alimony
Nothing in my cupboards just stale macaroni
Need me some sustenance, find me a bottle
Went into my paper as I stripped you a bottom
Yeah

[Hook: Q-Tip & Nicole Wray]
I hope you're happy
(You know I am baby)
Can't be happier than me

I hope you're happy
(I'm happy now darlin cos I got you where I want you to be)

[Verse 2: Billy Danze]
All of a sudden I'm the bad guy
Why cos I gave you everything?
Crib, cars, cash, bling
Average, sorry that just isn't my thing
Lavish bitch, I had you living like a queen
Well established, to the point you wouldn't stop to think
That if you step out on your boy
Ya probably wouldn't say
Being a groupie for Black Keys
I know it come with benefits
I lifted you from your knees
To show you what exquisite is
Please bitch, Things change ain't no robberies
So while you was in the back with that
You girlfriend Jen, was slobbing me
Its probably in the script for us to take it down

[Hook: Billy Danze & Nicole Wray]
Now I hope you're happy

[Verse 2: J.R. Writer]
Girl we shoot it slug it

Hit jacob and abuse my budget
Thats bright ice pipe price dikes hoes trully love it
Right boo and American Idol or Ruben Studdard
All my jewels get smuddered trust it ima thug forreal
Since Pac and Biggie I kept sixty on hug the steel
Now I glide fly and ride by above the grill
And fly jets yes where they pay with colored bills
Thats Canada, Panama, damnit uh
Equador, extra whores Penelapi, Pamela
All night more pipe allright girls stand up to my stamina
Look mama ima monster slash damager

Killa!

[Verse 3: Cam'Ron]
Mami said Como estas Gracias Muy bien
Yo quiero chenchar mama and ya trully friend boobie
Its a doobie unwrap ya doobie

The supa dupa trupa manuva smoove rocket
Boo had it the true jacket blue patches
Live and feed armors now I got 3 commas
My bank account thats what counts roll that leaf mama
F that cheap ganja I go to a weed farmer (Out West)

See the visa like the trees get 'em peach and chrome

F the keys of coke its only keys to cars keys to homes
And yes this I promise gliss on the wrist we can 5th like congress
This I won't tarnish you'll be astonished and I'm being honest
Killa!

[Nicole Wray]
Boy you got all I need and from what I see
And boy I'm constantly thinking of you
I just want you

[Hook]{Intro}
Black Ty and Nicole Wray got something to say man
Lets go
It ain't worth it man just put that shit down
I know you wanna hold me down but it ain't that serious man
Let me talk to you for a minute
Listen

{Verse 1}

I applaud you for being the breadwinner of the family
I applaud you for beating on niggas who couldn't stand me
I applaud you for being who you be to the block
But i dont care too much for niggas holdin' the Glock
Broke be the reason that you wearing them shoes
Broke be the reason you say fuck the rules
Broke be the reason that you get that urge
Broke be the reason that you flippin them birds
Manhood be the reason the reason that you carry the Glock
Manhood be the reason that you rob the spot
Manhood be the reason I keep stealing these cars
Manhood be the reason I'm behind these bars
I talk to God all the time but he never talk back
So I'm forced to communicate with these guns and crack
I refuse to crack even though I'm at a all time low
Lemme drink a 5th of courage and rob a store
But what's in store for a nigga with a quick come-up
Thats why you gotta put the guns up

{Chorus}
State of mind got you running wild
I see you lost your confidence in your one-two punch
Thats why you running around lost with guns (Sing to 'em)
You're just lost with guns (You're just lost)
Now if the shoe fits, wear it dont take it off yet
And i ain't made it through the song yet

{Verse 2}
A couple blunts will make it go away temporarily
Soon as it fades away i drink a fifth of Hennessy
I think its fucked up that reality has got the best of me
I'm praying i dont have to wake up (?)
My homies ain't there my mom ain't there my pops ain't there
Because nobody cares
They quick to blame a nigga for all the guns and violence
But ain't no one around to give a nigga some guidance
Throughout childhood they told me i needed to make money
But as i grew up they didn't teach me to keep money
So i made a little money and i lost a little bread
Might pay for some pussy might pay for some head
I keep a bag of lyrical carrots to help you niggas see straight
Hopefully the words of the song can get you out your old ways
If not i feel bad for you
Yeah im talkin to you i feel bad for you

{Chorus}

{Verse 3}
Listen you be you because you can't be me
Im done rolling 30 deep they tryna Mc Hammer me
Im an MC born into the heat of the streets
And ill be damned if i let a motherfucker hammer me
Tattoed be the city of Watts on my left wrist
I know a few niggas who'll watch when i slice that wrist
They tell me life's a bitch and supposedly you die and go to heaven
I was ordained to be an mc code 211
I saw my first MAC-11 at 11
A basehead was beggin for my triple o kevin
I see my nextel chirp got the federralli's listenin'
I keep my head cocked by my cock be the position
Man I'm living in fear Mama told me bullets got no names
Because of bullets no more Biggie, Pac, and Jam Master Jay
I know you think you bout as hard as they come
If i was you i would run because we running around lost with guns

{Outro, Nicole Wray singing}
Maybe someday you'll sit back and laugh and talk about the change
How you ain't the same
Gotta live with regrets but for now hood niggas
Come up out the game all our victims are slain
Dont you be lost with gunz (x5)[Intro - Cam'ron]
Ayo, I never claim to hard, tough, no homo, gangsta, none of the above
Just a kid from 140th and Lenox Ave, Harlem USA
Trying to make his way in the world, ya heard?
You know in the trials and tribulations that life brings
I lost some friends, incarcerated, some are gone forever
You know you can't expect everything from everybody
So get up, get out and get something
That's what I did

[Verse 1]
Before I had the hammer cocked or Santana rocked
Little Jerv, Grandpa Terry, Grandma Dot
Uncle Carl, Uncle Ted, Uncle Steve, Uncle Bill
Cousin Steve, Cousin Bill up on the hill, now
My Aunt Normy, I don't speak to my Aunt Dida
Or my Cousin Bathsheba; love my mother, Frederica
Neighbor Freda, daughter Raven and Nicka
Down another doorbell was that nigga Wardnell
He gave birth to the best MC you never heard
Leather after leather and was clever with whatever words
Derek Armstead, Bloodshed from C.O.C
He did damage, road managed by G-O-D
A.k.a. DukeDaGod, he was stupid hard
Sixteen, a bitch dream, had stupid cars
Cutlass 68', hooptie 75'
Still drive some bullshit, I don't know why
I love the nigga though, for him put Cris' in the air
First one dis 'em in here, I swear I'll risk my career
That's a fact, dick; ain't talking no rap shit
I'm talking that Mac clip, niggas will back-flip
Act sick; my dude studied the Sabbath
No beef, veggie nigga, maybe some catfish
He could have my house, he could keep my Mauri's
He could drive my cars, this a Eastside Story

That's why my dudes love me, I let them do them
You either gon' be rich or famous fucking with me...probably both
If you happen to brush shoulders with me by accident, play Lotto
9 out of 10 times you gonna win, nigga

[Hook - Nicole Wray]
Play the game, sure to win
They all up on me, know they wants my ends
I sacrifice, I roll the dice
I love my hood, I love my life

[Verse 2]
See, a boss I'm prepared to be
When I walk away from a confrontation
I ain't scared of you, I'm scared of me
I got a gun - you don't, so if flares you'll see
After that, a five-thousand volt chair for me
So I move carefully; niggas don't care for me
Who care? I don't; you share, I won't
Calm down, breathe again
I don't do extortion unless I'm on the receiving end
Talk to my money, first time I heard her speak
That's word to me, told me I deserved to eat
Moved to a killer Ave, right from a murder street
Rocked Adidas Forums, even though they hurt my feet (that's fucked up)
I don't look in the sky, never mind stars
Know some fine stars right behind bars
Snags, Black, Doe on house arrest
Zeek, Sheek, won't even throw out the rest
They wanted my ass, right along side Zeek
Turn myself in? Nope, play hide and go seek
I'm gone, put the clip in the chrome
Yeah, I'm just like a fly, see the shit that I'm on?
And hour after hour, I would chill at the after hours
Where they flash the powder, no bath or shower
In that same spot, realized math is power
So I point at the mansion that is ours[Mike Jones]
Who? Mike Jones - who, Mike Jones, who Mike Jones
Geyeah! Holla at your boy
Y'all know my cell phone number, geyeah!

Everyday I stay on my grind, and I hold it down 'til I'm not around
I mash for cash so I can eat, I grind so much that I hardly sleep
I'm pimpin the game, grippin the grain, under 25, gettin this change
A CEO at twenty-fo', holdin it down for that Texas mayne
Mike Jones, Nicole Wray, we stay on the grind, we don't play
In Fila {?} forever stay, puttin it down, for that pay
It's a man's world, that's what they say
But I think girls get {shit} they way
But who am I to argue and bust
I don't give a {fuck} you can kiss my nuts
I'm steppin out, hoppin in my Lo
Grippin on grain, tippin on Vogues
"Who is Mike Jones?" finally here, so go and pick it up out the sto'
I said - I'm steppin out, hoppin in my Lo
Grippin on grain, tippin on Vogues
"Who is Mike Jones?" finally here, so go and pick it up out yo' sto'

[Hook: Nicole Wray]
It takes a lot to be in a man's world
Believe it or not, I'm runnin for my girls
Holdin it down, ridin through yo' block
And if you get hot, I show 'em what I got
It's a man's world.. it's a man's world
It's a man's world.. but it wouldn't be nothin without me and my girls

[Nicole Wray]
Baby girl was workin real hard nine to five
Boss man came through, told her come inside
Said he didn't need her service no more
And everything she worked hard for out the door
First thing she did is thought about the kids
And how to pay the bills and keep food in the fridge
She said, "No! This ain't right!" Looked at him and said
"It's a cool world, and I'm destined for greatness"

[Hook]

[Nicole Wray]
It's a man's world.. it's a man's world
It's a man's world.. but it wouldn't be nothin without me and my girls

Couple years later, see the girl doin fine
Big ol' house and bright diamonds that shine
Drove by the old job, seen the old boss
Splashed water in his face, music loud and drove off
See what he ain't know, baby girl was gifted
Tried to hold her down, hold her back but he missed it
She's her own boss now, she stay gettin lifted
Party hard with her friends, stuntin on the fakers
Y'all ain't never seen no face like this
Bass like this, haze like this
Y'all ain't never seen no cash like this
Floss like this, boss like this - this is what she say to y'all
Y'all ain't never seen no face like this
Bass like this, haze like this
Y'all ain't never seen no cash like this
Floss like this, boss like this

[Hook]

[Nicole Wray]
It's a man's world.. it's a man's world
It's a man's world.. but it wouldn't be nothin without me and my girls

(Mike Jones! Mike Jones!)
It's a man's world.. whattup Dame? Whattup Devin?
It's a man's world yeah... yo, it's a man's world
And it wouldn't be nothin without me and my girls

[Mike Jones]
Holla at ya boy man
2-8-1, 3-3-oh, 8-zero-zero-fo'
Hit Mike Jones up on the low cause Mike Jones about to blow
Yeah! That's my real cell phone number too man
Holla![Nicole Wray: Hook]
I’d never do it again
Do it again
I’d never do it again
Cuz this is the end
This is the end
This is the end
I’d never do it again(hey)
Do it again (hey)
I’d never do it again (hey)
Cuz this is the end

[Verse 1: GLC]
My brother told me a long time ago
Don't focus where you been, G, focus where you tryna go
I swear the game make you cold like abominable snow man
Old man when you trying to shine like gold
When its my time to blow partner I'mma know
In the midst of getting dough I was here with highs and low
My Melo tried to play me like my fucking eyes was closed
Now im sittin here wishing that my guys didn’t know
They love a G, so they despise a soul
What they gon’ do to him, beyond my control
When the reaper calls, it's your time to go
Never play a nigga when you see that he is trying to grow
I'm Benny Blanco when he knocked out Carlito
And pachanga so im watching every angle
Under the moonlight with the devil I tangoed
Church on the move like Jesus in the manger
Better control the money, its better to control the anger
So now I watch a friend the way *that* I watch a stranger

[Hook]

[Verse 2: King Chip]
Chilling rolling up something to change my feeling
Thinkin about how I came up from nothing while i’m
Splitting this cigarillo, phone rings I get a call
One of my dogs tripping hard talkin about really killin them all
I say slow down, slow down
What the fuck you mean nigga
Just ran to your crib and popped your daughter in the spleen
I’ll be there in 20 minutes, but it only took fifteen
We wasn’t that tight but cool enough for me to hit the scene
No knowing this was all a set up
Secretly they want me wet up
Jealous of my future cheddar, however
They fastest move was too slow for me
I pulled up, wasn’t no ambulance, there wasn’t no police
Something fishy going on, naive kept pressing on
Nine gripped thinking the killer could still be on the lawn
Opened the front door they shot, I shot, some abrupt shit
The nigga with something to lose almost lost it, won't trust him again

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kid Cudi]
Cheese came through at 3
Salute at ease he supplied the weed
Cause Ibn had OD
Its me with a black rockstar steez
Real rock tees, $300 a pop for these
Please, bummy? You don’t owe me money
Day & Nite got flipped and I got blow for a grip
Sipping on a Heinie with my Jamie boo besides me
That's my fucking best friend
When I be tweaking she be calming a brother
Like the touch from a mother
I am so damn comfortable I never want to leave it
The feeling is something like a spiritual healer
That could end me, I think that’s the part I find intriguing
A little bit off I am, I am, I am
I see that im caught I am, I am, I am
It’s something like a spiritual healer that could end me
I think thats the part I find intriguing, im fiending

[Nicole Wray: Outro]
I’ll never do it again
Do it again[Verse 1: GLC]
My brother told me a long time ago
Don't focus where you been, G, focus where you tryna go
I swear the game make you cold like abominable
Snow man, old man, when you tryna to shine like gold
When it's my time to blow, partner Ima know
In the midst of gettin' dough I was here with highs and lows
My Melo tried to play me like my fuckin' eyes was closed
Now I'm sittin' here, wishin' that my guys didn't know
They love a G, so they despise a soul

That's my fuckin' best friend, when I be tweakin' she be calmin' a brother
Like the touch from a mother
I am so damn comfortable I never want to leave it
The feelin' is somethin' like a spiritual healer, that could end me
I think that’s the part I find intriguing
A little bit off, I am, I am, I am
I see that I'm caught, I am, I am, I am
It’s something like a spiritual healer, that could end me

[Nicole Wray]
I'll never do it again

[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
They don't bother you, well they don't bother me
Engine too loud on this brand new Ferrari V
So we couldn't hear the haters anyway, pardon me
Girls say I'm one of the biggest heart breakers arguably
Cupid shoot arrows but this girl make my heart bleed
I swear to God if I die she could make my heart beat

Beat, please resuscitate a G
Give me mouth-to-mouth or even give me south-to-mouth
Damn cause you don't know what she do to me
She could kill my soul only thing left is a eulogy
She so hot and ain't another brother cool as me
To get her cold as me I think I gotta buy her jewelry
What she do to me

[Hook 2: Dan Auerbach and Nicole Wray]
You don't know, hey
What you do to me (what you do to me, hey)
All I see, yeah, is new to me (is new to me, yeah)

Oh mama, (oh) what you do to me (what you do to me, yeah), yeah
In the meantime, in the meantime
They don't bother me

[Verse 2: Billy Danze]
I'm from the hell hole, the total opposite of Melrose

If you don't know me I suggest you ask your ten-four
Tell them the man here, Billy Danze here, Black Keys here
Mo-P's here, you say its poppin' if its rockin' listen we there
(You don't know)come on be clear (whatever you do to me)

You could never ruin me
I'm good, I flooded the hood like A.C
I'm modest, so you ain't really gotta praise me
I'm the artist, that's ghetto-ly known as O.G
With the (magnum), with forever kid (swagger)
You could never get

Stare at the moon, stare at the moon
Moonlight
Flying, wicked moon

[Verse 1: Angel Haze]
Uh, I awoke to the moon
The sun of the night
The stars have all landed
But there's evil in fight
There's screams in my mind
Night's the playground for the demons inside
Thought's the seesaw, and I'm singing with the slide
Mouth the sandbox, and swing's are my eyes
The devil's awake now
He's the prince of the earth now
I can hear every thought, every sound, every rock
Every ground, every creak in the earth now
And he's pleading with me
Tries to bring forth who he thinks I should be
Root of all evil and it's seed is in me
I drift away, and when need I'm asleep and
He tells me to drive, blinded to the elm of the night
Gonna show you what it means to be real
I want you to peel 'til you tear from inside
And I dance with a thought
Feels so good that I dance to the dark
Side of myself and it tears me apart
'Til it becomes the bass and the snare in my heart
He said starve on it
Feel it 'til you die for it
You can run run, but you never ever hide from it
Strive for it, kill to be alive for it
If you ever want it then you look up in the sky..

[Hook](x2)
Stare at the moon, stare at the moon
Moonlight
Flying, wicked moon

[Verse 2]
Uh, he's growing inside me
My continent's shiftin'
My logic is gone, my conscious is missing
My desire is strong
He's all around me like he's tied to my bones
He tells me don't think
He says I won't sleep
I won't be at peace 'til I liven his own
Now spit that blade
Pick it up, now take that blade
Don't trip, put it onto your skin
You can slowly stick it in
You can take my face
You can take my shape
Baby girl, you gon be just like me
Matter fact everything that you touch
They gon fill you in your guts, you a poison ivy
Don't run, don't hide
Don't scream, don't ask for god
Cause he can't help you now
From here out you are mine
And I scream so loud
But he took my voice so he comes out
And the sounds of my sins sound like sounds out his can
Like I'm drowning within whatever he spews out
And he runs me insane
He weighs a ton on my brain
Heat on my skin feels like sun on my face
And I can't take the blame for what he's done in my place
And, breathe deep and I exhale
Leaving me as an eggshell
And I'm cracking from the weight of confusion
From the weight of the fact that I can't tell
Who's who in this moment
Who's truly confirming
And I'm lost in a world
Tossed in a world I don't truly belong in
There's only one way out
My eyes go up and my blade goes down
Load it up, put the gun to my mouth
Pull the trigger, pow
The sun comes out like..

[Hook](x2)
Stare at the moon, stare at the moon
Moonlight
Flying, wicked moon

[Bridge: Nicole Wray]
Babylon don't pull me over
I'm so high
Same clothes from yesterday
I'm so blind
I'm just trying to make it through
Let me by
(The moon is changing, the moon is changing)
Happy go lucky these are my rules
Step to me, you get blasted
I'm insane, I love you
(The moon is changing, the moon is changing)
Changing(x8)

[Outro: Angel Haze]
Everything that happens is a message in disguise
The sun
Will rise
Even if it doesn't
Let this be the darkest time[Missy]
Timbaland, I need you to make these motherfuckers get crunk
I need you to bang em, bang em, bang em in their Jeeps
Timbaland I need you to make these motherfuckers get crunk
And I need them to bang em bang em bang em bang em in their Jeeps

[Verse 1: Nicole]
Ugh, who you talkin' to

Or you'll end up in a ICU
Boy, I got thing for you
And I'd do anything for you
But I need to know a thing or two
Am I the only one you callin' boo

[Chorus]
Don't lie to me baby
I would love to be your lady
But you be actin' crazy
And I wouldn't do it if you payed me
I would love to make it alright
And I would love to fuck all night
But damn it's not alright
Damn it's not alright

[Verse 2: Nicole]
Ugh, who you rollin' with
Do I meet all the benefits
Is these the only lips that you kiss
Am I the only one you fuckin' with
Boy, I got a thing for you
And I've been holdin' it down for you
And I be pissin' around for you
Am I the only one you callin' boo

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Am I
The only one that you callin' boo
Cuz I know I will always satisfy you
And nigga don't try to run no games
Cuz I'm so hot I'll take you down in flames..

[Prodigy]

I Know How You Feel (I Know You Feel Hurt)
You Just Don't Get Whats On My Mind (On My Mind)
But U Will Know What It Means To Be A Good (Bissy) (Yeah!)[Hook: Nicole Wray]
City lights wherever you are I’m solely drifting into New York

[Verse 1: Najee]
Yo everybody want to be heir to the throne
They like wait till I get it
Ain’t no crown in New York cause Biggie died with it
Corona and limes what I’m sipping
Stare at the page configuring ways to write different
Yours and my life is in no way compatible
My upbringing would have mentally damaged you
I let the ink tell it, deep stories in my melons
Stories of perseverance, refusal of failing
Money making Manhattan turn a snot nose into a captain
Life and times told through rapping
Home of the haze there’s plenty of ways to get paid
Beware of aids, killers with no names known to spray
Pretty mommies with plenty booty
Bodegas, parked outside, you got the chummy churies
Old timers playing dominos dropping jewels
If you listen then you guaranteed to glisten in it

[Hook]

Uh another worm out of The Big Apple
Where I earned my stripes like Mickey Mantle
Word to the torch held by The Statue of Liberty
You cannot un-Kindle me
It’s a love-hate relationship damn near
My family was lost to the cracks here
So I learned every block, observed every crack here
Po-9 finds us a very big catch here
Lights camera action
Welcome to Manhattan the city I run laps in
Harlem through the Heights and the Bronx son
The hood's Mike Johnson
Made moves in gold shoes
Green in Oz's, Bk throughout Queens they know the 2 Es
Victim of the system, child of the state
Overlooking the city I see my face in

[Hook]

Yo, Naj the Don, urban version of The New York Times
The city’s in my every line
I project the ghetto where
Projectiles eject out the metal
Be clear, the unbalanced attitude will get you leveled out here
Navy Blue fitted with the NY logo
Lees and a discrete Polo moving dolo
Roll with a G through this cold concrete
On these streets life’s lost over Bs and Cs
Dot all Is cross those Ts
Check both sides when you cross those streets
They shoot things
Damn I love this surface 80s baby Kool Herc helped birth this
Where heroes were made through heroin
5 boroughs, the most thorough in[adlibs: tabi Bonney]
Relax
And just and just and just
Relax

[Verse tabi Bonney]
*Entice* I'm taking the whole cake while others settle for a thin slice
They don’t know about my DNA, geno-type
Won’t ever see me locked, rocking horizontal stripes
Sky scraper views, up here, I swear I can conquer the world in about a day or two
As my girl bubble gum chews, such a beautiful mixture
The scene is fondu
We livin’ life like, we in the sun light, all day and all night
Dreams are life like, and they come true
This is my world now, you should come through
Redecorated knock down a couple walls then we elevated
Added more floors we on the elevator
On our way up, to the stars, we out a here babe
Au revoir

[Hook Nicole Wray]
Ohh, feeling more, feeling more [feeling?] baby
Ohh, feeling more, feeling more [feeling?] baby
Ohh, feeling more, feeling more [feeling?] baby

[Verse 2 tabi Bonney]
Exotic pedigree, up in these heels chilling out with Beverley
Everything's pink, beauty's going to be the death of me
Samantha [Aransas?], is in charge of this gorgeous medley
Daily paper gets you influence from neighbors
Fit and [riding?] without a trip to the tailor
Nonbelievers in DC caught the vapors
If you really knew me you’d know I'm a freak of nature
I’m so far removed from a day-shift
Like a K. West College Dropout playlist
I don't got a boss, so you can't say shit
We laughing at them bamas at work nodding off
They used to be us until I left work one day
And all I got in return was a good luck
And that good luck turned into a good look
Because now I'm pissing on the game without the seat up

[Hook]
Ohh, feeling more feeling more [feeling?] baby
Ohh, feeling more feeling more [feeling?] baby
Ohh, feeling more feeling more [feeling?] baby

LA nights New York lights the things we like are over priced
LA nights New York lights the things we like are over priced
And uh and uh and uh and uh and uh, we livin’ life
LA nights New York lights the things we like are over priced
LA nights New York lights the things we like are over priced
And uh and uh and uh and uh and uh, we livin’ life[Intro: Hurricane Chris]
It's been a long time comin
They wonder why I act like this, you heard me
It's all I know

[Nicole Wray]
They see us, still got much to learn
But otherwise still got money to burn
I'm in the streets can't take it out of me
I get money, get money, that's all I know

[Chorus: Nicole Wray]
They see us, still I got much to learn
But otherwise still I got money to burn
I'm in the streets can't take it out of me
Get money, get money, that's all I know

[Hurricane Chris]
How could you criticize me for actin like I act if I ain't never had a thing
My daddy got locked up when I was 12, my whole life changed
My momma hustled hard and did (?) to get the bills paid
While you was probably ridin around the city in your Escalade
But now that I got money, I went and bought me two mansions
Just to stunt on them niggas who told me I never had it
I walked out the door the other day and my momma told me
You got a lot of nerve, she told me just because we got all this money to burn
Don't think you can't be in terms
A cold victim to the street so I stay packin some heat
Twenty-four hours, seven days of the week, cause they creep
Twenty-four hours, seven days of the week, I'm a beast

[Chorus]- repeat 2x

[Hurricane Chris]
I'm 18 years old and I done seen more drama than that lil'bit
Go on and (?) to talk about it unless you hear this
My pedal to the medal while I'm thinkin about all of my dogs
I lost in the street tryna ball like me
And this is for my niggas who used to roll gold D
Poppin the trunk on them swingers, hoppin out in tall tees
So all my niggas that's ballin and feel like me
From the struggle, you gutter to makin a lot of G
Keep my head up, remember who got me right where I'm at today
Long as I got money I give a damn what a hater say
One thing I know for sure I'ma get paper 'til it ain't no more
Plus I got a crazy flow...huh
I know somebody say "A hard head make a soft ass"
That's why I keep the Glock on the seat when I'm ridin in my jag
51/50, you don't know nothin about me
Homeboy I'm a (?), still ain't learn

[Chorus]- repeat 2x

[Hurricane Chris]
I'm makin money, nigga you can't tell me shit
I'm gon' keep on stuntin, steady shinin on the haters

[Nicole Wray]
I'm countin money, doin my thang, I be hustlin
From Monday to Sunday, doin what I want, I be gettin it in

[Chorus]- repeat 2x[Mocha]
But uh anyway
You could catch me any day
Sipping Hennessey
And my peeps get plenty way
But anyways, to see that I hold this dough
Cats fake it
I made it
I told you so
Mocca late kid
We no play
Stress free, sexy and Montego Bay
It's a pity that
Yall look like idiots
Yo boo let me know when I should rip this cat

[Nicole Ray- Verse 1]
My man he don't call me anymore
He don't even cares
Damn right, this fool
What must I do
To keep him loving me
All this love I give
That ain't cool

1-  I got what you want (got what you want)
I got what you need (got what you need)
Can I get another shot
This time I'ma make it hot
(repeat x 2)

[Nicole Ray - Verse 2]
Call while I'm at the crib
He turned off his phone
Said to call him back
Why silly me
Why didn't I suspect
He was making love
To someone else
Boy you killing me

[Repeat 1]

Oh yeah (x 4)

[Repeat 1]
[Missy Elliott]
I'm sitting on the side of the curb
With a pocket of herb
I don't know if yall heard
I'm high as a bird
I can fly like Kelly
I can glide like skates
Me with no Timbalands
Is like Puff with no Mase
Wait , hold up
Wait a minute, what you say
Back it up, give me space
Who that, Nicole Ray
By the way, DJ, better play all day
Make the whole world say "Damn they suckem nay"
Yo yo yo
