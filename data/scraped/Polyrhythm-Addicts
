[Verse One: Mr. Complex]
After all, these years
I core finally came through
Now I got it, what? The power
It's like kinetic
I just sit back and let it
Flower up
And bouquet for all those dead
Sick in the head mother [?]
Ow yeah, touche
Un garde, here you are
It's a lyrical scar for you
It's like a lick on tattoo
It's gas cause your raps pass initiation
Don't front
Whichever which way you facing
I see you, it fits you, like a brand new
Mitsu-bishi, [?] like you're assorted
Mixed up, wishy washy, whoopsy daisy
Topsy turvy, I got your goggles glossy
[?] to rhyme will make you say, "Oh shit, I lose it."
That's how I does my music
No wack rhymes make it through
I got a fresh phrase filter
So check out what I'm gonna do for you, my man
If you wanna be an MC, crazy nice with no flaws
Three payments of $19.99 it could be yours
C'mon you can't beat it, them is crackhead prices
With Complex inflation faced with the crisis
See I could be a creature of whim
But for some strange reason I just don't sound like them
I'm so nice I get mad
It's a crucial situation when you pen me with the pad

[Hook: Mr. Complex]
Hold up, freeze
See these are not your ordinary three MC's
You catch a brain freeze
Hold your main squeeze
This is not a tease
Please, believe, these are not your ordinary three MC's
These are not your ordinary three MC's
This is not a tease
Hold your main squeeze
You catch a brain freeze
See these are not your ordinary three MC's

[Verse Two: Apani B. Fly]
Can't recall toward the misty morn'
In the midst of calm, atmosphere quite warm
Glistening from steam
Perceive active energy from radio beams
Now sense is unusually keen
All seem norm as I peep the scene
Initiated exercises in breathing
To keep spiritually clean
Pass through the realm of well
Sad settled nestled in the crater of supreme
Clearance of interference is an e-fficient machine
The league
Are sailing in this monopoly partially cause I never copy
Who want this hot property?
Can only, cop it from me
Dead silly fantasies and outdated dreams
Must make immediate goals succeed
Believe it constantly need achievement
My core comes frequent
Master of redefining my meaning
Mistress of mysterious sequence
The mortal plane is my residence
But we got to overcome it
Multiply in size, instantly rise and hover above it

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Shabaam Sahdeeq]
Some got game, some got lyrics to back they name
Some got fame, some got cash, it's all the same
Some got locked, some got they spot taken over
Some got blacked out, lights out, party over
Some got a job, some got to hustle and steal and rob
Some rocks they real hair, fingernails and eyes
Who got something to say? Step up and speak your mind
Cause I'ma speak mine, blow the spot one time
Throw your palms up, reach for the sky
Clutch a cloud, bring it down
Throw in your swerve kid, work your ground
Ferris Wheel style, still holding it down
Nothing changed but nickles and dimes I bust mine
We blend, come taste it laced like daiquiri's
Actually, we raise the stakes constantly
You gambling, when you mic handling against we
Three the hard way, get diced by wordplay

[Hook][Verse One: Mr. Complex]
As far as the show go
You said I can get in free, three or fo', no mo'
Well I got fifteen with me, so how you like those balls?
You don't swing in life catching a lot of close calls
Let me in so I can send your friends, frenzy like
You wanna live it up, give it up, stop being the stingy type
I wanna eat so I peep mics with rhymes and beats
That I'll beat ya butt, but that's the surface
Cause deep down the sound will move your feet
But if that was the only feature it would defeat the purpose
You can't write a rhyme to make a crack head stop smoking crack
Or make a klepto give it back
Or kick a word that'll make a whole herd
Or even one human being attack
That's wack like my backhand swing with a tennis rack'
Kid, get out my face before you get the smack
Like that, boodoom bap bap it's like that

[Hook: Pharoahe Monch]
It's Complex with the lyrical flex to break necks
If you don't believe then check the text
(Take me home)
DJ Spinna the winner, he's no beginner
Chopping up beats for you to eat for dinner
(Take me home)
Shabaam Sahdeeq freak mic techniques
Every month of the year, every day of the week
(Take me home)
Apani B. Fly you know you can't deny
You're like the stimuli that gets everybody high

[Verse Two: Apani B. Fly]
It's really all for you why I do what I do
Spend hours thinking 'bout how to break down the truth
Spit it out in the vocal booth
Mic checked it and inject it into ADAT's
Carved onto wax, so DJ's can take me home in record bags
Needles drag and fingers scratch
Interpreted in mix format
Now I'm back on the shelve in abundance
To count the wealth from the proceeds
Of tapes and CD's
For me
This whole MC thing is a breeze
I am to please
The moment exists to sees
Explore locations overseas
Where the air tastes fresh when you breathe
Make you feel it in your knees
Sensations only felt in your dreams
Experience divine vibration in physical formation be a means
Of releasing frustration
Take me home and put me in your Playstation

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Shabaam Sahdeeq]
Yo
We make moves unseen
Ain't seen cream
High strung three with the power to gleam
Bring it home like the gold
Cash with no fold
Plan to own homes in lands where cows roam
Plug in, your headphones
Wackness, not condoned
Poly cats rock your dome like bricks hitting the hard hat
Regardless of traps, brandish the facts
Hand 'em the wax
If you like it play that, love it (spin that)
Just a man trying to live out my life span
But I can see my life slipping through my hands like grains of sand
Can I make it?
(Yes you can)
Can I take it?
(Yes you can)
To the rest and put it up on the stand
Soft served, I play herbs to the side, cruise along for the ride
And when I hit skid, they slid to the side
It's all fair in war
Cause we gon' make it happen regardless of all of y'all

[Hook][Verse One: Apani B Fly]
Strong woman I am
One of three players in a pyramid
Position on a grid
Wise like an Egyptian
Once again where I am to claim my crown
Manifestly bound to orbit around
The outer limits
Think of my cipher and infinite
Including everything in it
Greet each day as a new beginning
Opportunity to be and think different
Not comprehending members of the human race
That neglect the facts staring them in the face
They choose not to elevate
I was born to illuminate tracks
Added for the phatness of the boom
Attack like lightning striking static when I enter the room

[Verse Two: Shabaam Sahdeeq]
Yeah we take it to a higher plane
Up there with the rain clouds and charter planes
Up there with Venus, Jupiter and Mercury
Move free
Nothing around to slow me down see
Float like a gypsy
Roam like a nomad
Homes where I lay mine
State to state, plate to plate is how they play us
In the mist of chaos we bring our vibe
Multiple rhythms, caught in the prism with lyricism
The rest get sizzled, throwed like beef grizzle
Beats get chiseled, rhymes get sculpted
Put it in they whip and they bump it till they tape pop
Poly hip hop
Get it together 'fore our shit drop

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Mr. Complex]
This squad of MC's that come in threes like death
Now you need to save your freestyle money for the ref
I stop you where you shop
Break you down where you buy your jewels
Make it look like fools in front of the people you front to
I confront you
And tell you you got Six Minutes of Doug E. Fresh and hunt you
And embrace you
It's a waste that you'll waste your money
The way you'll waste your mind
You caught a facial
Now you're reaching for your waistline
But your chase is as slim as crackhead's body frame
I end your game
My pain expresses itself
Bruises dresses itself
A force presence is felt
As I swing around the uni-
-Verse and verse to make your out burst

[Hook][Verse One: Apani B. Fly]
Deaf and blind to all dumb rappers
Capture 'em in sound proof bubbles, keep that dumb shit muffled
Above average, individuals stellar
Non savage, love living right on the rise but not lavish
Dodge madness from stages and vanish
Feminine not manish but manage
To man handle matters that get hectic
Back track steps like dyslectics
Maintain bird's eye perfected
Above rhetoric, settle scores with wit lip from the tip
Scripts mixed with paradox, drop kick a verse
Send it flying over tree tops
Bust a nigga lopsided on the other side of the map
Just to let him know where I'm at

[Verse Two: Shabaam Sahdeeq]
I make 'em move they feet, incredible heat
Soften the tar on the street when I glide over beats
Make your sneakers stick to the concrete, I bomb fleets
Leave heaps of trash MC's, tall like the Rockies
Mockeries, them cats on wax, they carbon copies
I see 'em in the clubs on the streets and on beats
Watch we
They smile in your face then try to lace you
I see it in they facial, cats they stay dilly
I do this here, for the love of music, money secondary
Skip the preliminaries let's get it on baby
I mash it up and add the gravy
Maybe we can make it happen so glorious
Polyrhythm world tour

[Hook: Joc Max of Jigmastas] {x2}
Yo, the Poly's rhyme
While most MC's waste their time
They define, exactly what it takes to shine
Line after line
I'm sure that these cats can blow your mind
Footprints in the sand, you're seven steps behind

[Verse Three: Kriminal of Jigmastas]
Outfitted, we roll wit it
Double digit lyrics, spit it rapidly
You feel it hard as acrylic, for real it's a pleasure
Whenever we drop treasures, extreme measures
Ledgers of composition verbalize and then sever heads
Brethren, we taking US to UK
Where my crew sprays spells "doomsday"
What did his tomb say?
"Stupid rapper lacking content and subject matter"
Insufficient data when you rhyme
Made the crowd scatter
Make the crowd's gather, we the opposite
Bring apocalypse in many shapes and form
What I spit, it ain't the norm
It's like a killer swarm
Off of Africa, attacking ya, vernacular
[?] made from scratch screaming, "Polyrhythmats"

[Verse Four: Mr. Complex]
For real you're lucky I decided to become an MC
O
M.P
Lex, Lex
Not like auto
Cause you can be brand new one day and crashed the next
Where Complex remains immortal
As long as you hit the red button and stop fronting on the pause
The cause is good, the floors is wood but they tremble
Cause you assemble
Cause you resemble
A herd of cattle
Heard you wanna battle
But you can battle yourself till you cause a war
Will laugh with you till you born
You get torn from the morn'
You get born from the porn
So don't frazzle with me
While I poly
The rhythm the rebel
Been the addicts
And just like Spike it'll strike, She's Gotta Have It

[Hook]
