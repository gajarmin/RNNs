[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Mange Strusic! Bang bou yitch!
Follow me now see, check it out
I say: this song is dedicated to the ball droppers
But I'mma switch the letters around and say drall boppers!
We coming to get ya so get the message to all coppers
That you need protection or you better have ch'all yoppers!

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
What a shame when a thang blast at ya
Cause you're lame you're a dame slash actor
These dudes are ho's from screws to toes
They choose to go bass ackwards

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Tecca Nina bout to hit 'em wit the woop wop
Now the barrel of my governor is hoo tot
Cause you the type that'll get your whole shew crot
Loud mouth nigga trippin' thinking that he Putac
Got a strong hand, I'm a mown gran
Little boy, now you fuckin' with the clong wran
Oh you just showboatin'? It's over now y'all can quit
Cause you can get it for something mere as shalkin' tit
Just a cone phall, then it's on y'all
Fuck around and get ya dome sawed off a brone stawl
I can't wait to hear ya squeal and holler
How you set trippin' when you got a multi-dillion mollars, nigga
Stupid, such a sucker--
Nuck figgas always got to make a totha bruch her
Never had no problem takin' down another buster
Cause they be doin' shit bass ackwards futhamucka

[Hook: Tech N9ne] (x2)

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
I'm Yo Gotti, the drug dealer
I'm Yo Gotti, the thug nigga
I'm Yo Gotti, my own hitter
And if you wanna ODX, then say Yo Gotti the plug, nigga
I've been getting money for a long time
You've been bangin' throwing up the wrong sign
Pussy ass nigga, you a cross gender
Fuck boy, you a ho nigga
And you remind me of my ho, nigga
Nothin' I hate worser than a broke nigga
Got a Tec-9, and an AK, and an FN
Got a white Vette, and a white Ghost, and a white Benz
I ain't runnin' with niggas, 'less I'm gettin' money with niggas
I don't act funny with niggas, keep it a hundred with niggas
Kept a thousand with niggas
I ran in houses with niggas
I put in work with the squad, we even sold flour to niggas
But, fuck

[Hook: Tech N9ne] (x2)

[Verse 3: Big Scoob]
Bass ackwards, synonymous with rappers
All these niggas claiming maintaining that they factors
When'd you push a package? When'd you ever clap shit?
All these niggas talking ain't done nothing but this rap shit
Reason why I shook this place and had to find some space before
I killed one of these rap niggas and ate they fucking face
Outta place in this rap game, biggest mistake I ever made
Hit rewind and de-line, deleting everything I layed
Far from a rap nigga, I don’t lie for fun
Fuck fame, and fuck you, and fuck him, and her too
Nina called the big dog, I had to breathe smoke
But Yo Gotti and Big Scoob and this ain’t 'bout dope?
Bass Ackwards

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
These niggas ass backwards
She let me hit that ass backwards
Pussy niggas act hard, get killed for bad acting
Trigger man laughin'
It's funny how this shit go
Redrum was the case that they gave me
I sipped slow and stumbled down a slipped slope
I could hide the chopper in the trench coat
Tunechi go berserk in this bitch
Spellin' stressed backwards, dessert with my shit
I'm reversing this shit
My double R & R, I park on the curb in this bitch
The money, I'm submerged in this shit
So frankly, I'm stalking Ben Franklin
I am Wayne Carter, oops, I meant Cayne Warter
Cocaine on back order
Flip you ass backwards
Bitch you are bass ackwards if you think that's awkward
Strange Music[Intro: Tech N9ne]
First entry for Sickology 101: Dysfunctional

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Yeah, don't you bring me nothing stupid
If you don't want me to lose it
Step back if you don't want me to attack
I'm a beast, better give me the deuces
I have no tolerance for nonsense, get away from me
Nina wanna get dollars
Don't wanna holler but you makin' me
I'm a little dysfunctional
You're the problem, please don't awaken me
And I'm that way cause back in
The day most have forsaken me
La-di-da-di, I'm at the party
On a drunk night with a punk, might dudes
Tryin' to pick a fight because he's sorry
That he ain't Gotti, like I be, cause he
Sloppy, not me, costly rocks be spot free
But he don't know I'm roguish
Surrounded by my soldiers
And they be locked and loaded
Will explode if you can't hold us
And we don't got no scruples
We didn't come to fight and shoot you
But you busters better be mutual
Don't get loose because we cuckoo
Listen, they call me genius, I run the show
Women be on my penis, it's wonderful
Demons think they the meanest
But I brung the foe on the floor
Little bit sick, don't you know?

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
I'm a little dysfunctional, don't you know?
If you push me, It might be bad
Get a little emotional, don't you know?
If you fool around and make me mad
I'm a little dysfunctional, don't you know?
If you push me, it might be bad
Get a little emotional, don't you know?
Might fool around and make me mad
Don't make me mad

[Verse 2: Big Scoob]
Born to hustle, I'm a product of environment
The game done changed, so I've been forced into retirement
But I make moves and I paid dues and I got common sense
Since I can't lose and I can't choose, then I'll come back to spit
I got hit songs but I've been gone so long that I don't fit
Kneeled at the throne, but can’t get on, so I need me a lick
I write these songs but don't belong I'm on some other shit
I'm huntin leads in desperate need, I hope it's comin' quick
I'd wrap my brain to find a lane that's gon' bring me some change
But it's so strange, my life has changed and I am not the same
I come around but since I'm down, it feels uncomfortable
I try to hide it deep inside but I'm dysfunctional
I never learned to hold it in, I gets emotional
First, implode and then explode, I am combustible
So please don't push to play me, pussy, on some real shit
Won't be defeated if I'm heated, nigga, oh shit!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]
I ain't no killer but don't push me
Goody-goody choir boy never been no pussy
Could be carrying something up under my hoody
Krizz would never snap and kill a baller, y'all, or would he?
Now I wanna be peaceful, but I carry Desert Eagles where
Ever black people are, you know how black people are
I peep 'em out, try to stay evened out
Wanna preach to 'em but their evil keep on seepin' out
Emotions get the best of me, messed up
And then y'all get the rest of me
Depressed and stressed, feel like my destiny
I know y'all think less of me, cause I'm always sick
And I can't let it be, pharmaceutical soup be the best recipe
It's gon' be the death of me, I need depakote
Just to cope, while I keep throwin' them pills down my throat
Dysfunctional blunts will do Smokin' Bombay
Can give me Fung Shui, but I wish that it all would go away
Or maybe I should pray for Jesus Christ to just un-pretzel me
Tryin' to pray for change, but sometimes it feel like he lets it be
So I just take another couple doses, probably be fine
But if you get too close you'll find out that I

[Hook][Instrumental vocal loop: Tech N9ne]
Some gangstas wanna head blast, cause I run with the red rags

[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Free Uno Ace Capone. The homie Keith Fudge, I got your back homie
LETS GO!

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Crew, soo-woo
Nigga that's what we do
Who, be you
If you want funk me too

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
I'm bool as a bubumber
Laces in my shoes makin you wonder
Am I gonna act a fool or bring your crew thunder
Thinkin I pack the tool, the one I use on her
I ain't trippin but the old days got my mind glitchin
Like different signs that ain't my kind got they 9's whistlin
Like a nigga wanna find this and strip clips till my wines drippin
But nobody wanna do no crime they just talkin about rhyme spittin
When I'm at the movies, careful how you steppin to me
Cause I think who's starin at me wanna do me
Cause Im flamed up and soo woo-ey
Head crash, my head's bad
Cause I be thinking some gangstas wanna head blast
Cause I run with the red rags

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
I'm a motherfucking animal, red devil, Tasmanian
Bangins' in my cranium, Deuce Cique and five claimin it
Kansas City thang, from two clips at my range is bandana dangerous
You's crip when I'm sayin' it?
It's Soo-Woo business, then yous through nigga
Blood? I don't give a fuck if I knew you nigga
That's that 85 mentality, victim of your reality
Catchin, pumpin' that 7-11 in your fatalities
It's another nigga's wake-up, smoke water and drank up
Heavenly, blocks flames from 20's to the seventies
It's ballers tuckin' fed cash, to get you dead fast
Gangstas they head blast cause I run with the red flags!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
Uh, I'm just bicken back and bein' bool
You don't this feelin, look you fuckin with the realest
No, gloves no, mask look you know we bout to kill it
Disrespect us will get your mami pinned to the ceilin
This is still holdin hemi's even when I'm in my jammies
Niggas wanna catch me slippin leave me sleepin like a mami
Plus they still sendin threats, haters wanna pack me out
Bunch of internet hustlas always wanna run they mouth
I ain't trippin still thuggin for blood and getting guap
And you know I keep a oo-op let it sing just like a doo-wop
And it's always tough guys, they don't never wanna co-op


[Hook]

[Verse 4: Big Scoob]
Signed up, suited and booted, old nigga, ready for war
Layin back, stackin cake, but it don't take much to activate
Snatch it back and act innate, rainin' down the hand of god
Chopper get to sanging nigga smokin' like it’s El DeBarge
Forgive me Lord I'm trynna keep it cool
But I'm a old nigga with a quick fuse, quick to smell the bitch in dudes
Hard to walk in Scooby's shoes, do the shit that Scooby do
Fi' block, a general, I done paid my fuckin dues
Nigga this the life I chose, fuck that, life I choose
Still livin gang rules check the laces in these shoes
Gangsta nigga through and through, tried tested been approved
On blood, one love, nigga what, soo-woo

[Hook] x2[Verse 1: Rittz]
I'm, too hot to cool off
Blew Atlanta up like Eric Rudolph, and starving in pursuit of moolah
Floss and get your crew robbed, my crew'll shoot at you like "hoorah"
I be on tour and shit, you get on stage and you get boo'd off
You throwing jabs at me but we ain't in no boxing gym
I'll stab you and have you inside of a hospital hooked up to oxygen
So who the hottest? Conversation my name get brought up in
I'm Woody Harrelson, this industry is Zombieland
You wanna fuck with us, you must've had no common sense
I'll kill you then your guts get eaten up by Brotha Lynch
It's Strange Music so the competition nonexistent
All them other record labels fallin' off like rotten limbs
I'm making some money, it's making their stomach cringe
I'll never forget it, a couple of summers ago, I was cooking and scrubbing pans
Drink 'till I get drunk and spin
Puffing something with a lovely scent behind the Cutlass tint
Floating in the Strange stream, who jumpin' in?

[Verse 2: Prozak]
My brain is full of thoughts that are darker than Samhain
That span across the Great Lakes and vast Midwest Plains
Spreading coast to coast like a virus you can't contain
Now a global pandemic, panic courtesy of (STRANGE!)
The biggest independent label, pop the champagne
We don't need no head now, homie you can keep the change
Coming through your speakers, receive us into your blood vein
We the truth like Nostradamus' prophecy quatrains
Snake Bat, Praise that, part of rap since way back
Since the days of 8 tracks and 808's and adaps
Analog cassette decks, steady grinding, what's next?
Starving artist 'til Trav and Tech cut me that advanced check
Strange outcast step child, call me Damien
Five Finger Death Punch straight to the cranium
Flow so sick, could be enriched with uranium
Extraterrestrial, lyrics labeled alien

[Verse 3: Big Scoob]
Appetite destruction, never been no punk shit
My voices give me choices, just to spite me I choose dumb shit
Choppers all around me, I mean lyrical and literal
Spit it through this microphone and pull up at ya mami's home
Jump out on the dumb shit, speaking through this drum clip
Tearin' flesh, rippin' hips, watch me kill shit
Cypher without the villain, that's appealin' but it's silly though
An army without it's general, an octopi no tentacles
Not trying to be subliminal, nothing I do is minimal
Heavy hitter, heavy words, push a nigga, pushin' verbs
Squish my button, you push my nerves, ten toes in the turf
Not the last or the first, gutta nigga, stomp the Earth
Grippin' metal, I ain't special, on the level
Smack your temple with the barrel, not complying, I'm a rebel
And I'm fresh up out the ghetto, puppet master, I'm Geppetto
Take a minute, you'll get it, nigga, Scoob did it

[Verse 4: Krizz Kaliko]
Kali Baby! 'Ight man, I'mma do this! I'm kinda nervous
The purpose of having a cypher is so you can sit here
Wide-eyed, listen, look at me in this position
Now, I coulda just left you sitting there
But Nina told me to pick 'em apart, you're a victim of art
K-R-I to the double crooked, look at him
He pudgy like they took a ugly stick and frickin' shook at him
And I don't stay Gucci down to the linens
I'll let you trick off, she jerking my dick off and grinnin'
You can see him, but he just a figment
You wanna be him, better get your pigment gone
Try to beat him with deliverin'
I get belligerent and that's the end of the song
And I get a little bit ahead of myself, feel like I'mma melt
And I feel like I'm better than everyone else
I guess I be rappin' ahead of my wealth
I'm the coldest thing since the ice cube
Only thing missing from this beat back in the day was Ice Cube
Yeah, I said I'm the best in a minute, nigga what?!
Only niggas that could contest it is rested, dig em up!
Okay! Hahahaha! Whatever, nigga...[Intro]
Slegna Headquarters, 2014
Everyday is a struggle
We dread the day and pray we make it through the night
Anything turn up we with it
So I buzz cut my hair
Put on my please-come-trip-with-me suit
Lace my boots tight and what
Ahhwoo ahhwoo ahhwoo
Turn up, turn up

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Hard times living in this bad land of mine
Everybody on vanilla skys by design
A lot of my brothers are buried, a lot of 'em in their prime
So take my chopper and stick it where the sun don't shine
Ahhh - please don't make me make you say that
Tripping cause momma ain't really happy where she stay at
I can't afford to move her away until I pay that
IRS a new Maybach, I'm tripping don't come my way, Jack
Son needs a way through college
Daughter too, harder, you gotta pay for true knowledge
Sinner eyes when a guy get layed off
Everything ain't payed off enterprise
Beam up, I'm finna die, in a lie, them and I minimized
I'mm kinda tripping in my go clothes
Step with malicious intent, I'm throwing boat loads
To my soul goes
The average person they hurting cause for certain everybody's dolo

[Hook ×2: Big Scoob]
I'm with the bullshit tonight
If they tripping I ain't tryna do right, uh, uh
I'm with the bullshit tonight
Let it loose on every devil in sight, turn up
   
[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
Yeah, tell 'em I'm tripping, I'm at war with these devils
Dumped that bitch in the gutter, they can't get on my level
I ain't give a fuck about nothing with the way I'm strapped up with this metal
I was tripping in the back of a truck that I done packed with these shovels
I don't want no problems, just want you to leave me the fuck alone
Before I end up inside of a cell and have a neighborhood inside of your home
My money be funny just laughin at niggas
And the hoes they got keep asking them niggas
How I'm crashing them niggas while I'm passing them niggas
Well, take your seat and fasten them niggas
Before I dispose the trash of them niggas, go to smashing them niggas
I'm on that bullshit, ain't nobody finna pull shit
D got my wrists rolls-es balling, I'm on some bullshit
Pay attention
It don't get no realer, hater killer, about that drama
Terroristic, risk it, you get Truth Osama
If I don't get you The Boss back to me with that llama
Bitch this is what we do, believe it, downing niggas' mama's

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Red Cafe]
Cocaine on my mama's table, I'm out of line
Doing lines open wide, nigga suicide
Blood in my vein, hella drugs in my vein
Rap with the strap, keep the thugs entertained
All my foes I leave critical, they pitiful
I'm a 5 star general, East side cannibal
West side salute it, all these kids my students
Class still in session, the shooters I just recruited
Turn up - look I came to bust a motherfuckin head
Got some wild knucklehead killers bucking lead
I came from the bottom, now I'm on the roof
I'm big-headed so the coupe never had a roof
Thug life, got that 2Pac up in my boombox
Gassing on these pussies, no brakes, they pray I do stop
We all with the bullshit and I'm the boss
When I holla shake down we gonna set it off

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Big Scoob]
So with it, if you want it then you gonna get it
So terrific with this bullshit, the best that did it
The best to give it, get me livid then I'm diving in it
These pussies talk it, they don't walk it, they ain't never did it
Aim and bust then I bust then I bust and bust
Blood gush in the rush from the school crushed
Scarce thoughts being bought from these wars fought
Real talk, I'm a validated warhawk
History, this ain't shit to me, let's get it, V
Click the heat, no defeat, I need victory
It's meant to be what these villain niggas bent to be
Tendecies, stick this story, fuck the enemy
Snapping and losing it fast - Ruger, extended the mag
Fuck it, they wearing no mask - jump out and dumping the brass
Crushing, concussion these fast - a movie where Scoobie get mad
Jesus ain't helping your ass - leaving inside of a bag
I'm with the bullshit[Intro: Tech N9ne]
B. Boys and B. Girls stand up
Down south, midwest, east coast, west coast
Globally, everywhere, yeah!
Tech N9ne now! Let's go!

[Hook: Tech N9ne] (2X)
Swing first, I'mma destroy
You a curse, I'mma B. Boy!
Cherried up, got 'em P'noid
Let the whole world know, I'm a B. Boy!

[Verse 1: Big Scoob]
I watched Snoop do it, he let that blue flag hang
So watch Scoob do it, I'mma let the brown rag swang
Middle deuce to it, boy that's just a five six thang
Now SOO WOO! WOO! That's how we rep this gang
I ain't new to it, vill I got that bang in my veins
And I'm true to it, all I know is bangin' and 'caine
So get used to it, validation now I'm with Strange
OG villain off the block representer of them flames

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
I pledge allegiance to the flag, my united hoods of [?]
I'm certified, around the top banging was so influencing
I made it with my heart, a vendetta, in hopes of unity
And left out a with family, a forty cal and a newer me
Deuce click represent, red rag regiment
Red rope replicates, whips runt recreate
Rest won't recommend, refs don't let you win
Red Rider Warriors we reppin' to find the testament we

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Skatterman]
5"10', 235, hell of a left hook
Niggas think the feds came and got me when they got West Crook
A vent look, pull up stuntin' and get your vet took
Or we could stand mano a mano and get your best whooped
Knuckle up knucklehead, nigga been with this knuckle game
Still fuckin' with Scoob, Kutt and Kali, baby ain't nothin change (STRANGE!)
A drive for no paper work, organize drive-by's and your neighbor hurt
Send a couple down and hey you and your neighbor murked
Show you I ain't playin' fuck around and knock your neighbor first
It's Skatterman, pussy mortar just took virgins son
Who you think Tech gonna call to make sure that the dirt get done
Red cap, red shirt, red shoe strings
My .45 is a bitch, and I think she havin' mood swings (mood swings?)
You think them boys got guns watch what your dude bring
Fully auto AR-15, wipe out the Blue Team!

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]
Beats bangin' better bring it big or bounce bitch
'Bout to blastin' in blood I'm back in this black brick
Boss ball I've been breakin' bread 'n baguettes brie
And beautiful biancas, videos, and Vegas with big B
Bow before brilliance, blessed to be buildin' it
Best in this barrio bane and bazaar we more bills in this
Bankin' his babies be blingin' and his boo be that big booty!
Big bust! Be in his benzo bronze and get big bucks!
I'm a black baboon, bring me bags of bananas
Bonefied, billy bad ass with a brown bandana
Been gone on Bacardi 'bou lou but I'm bout to be bigger bent
Better break if you bustin' before I'm blown and belligerent
Six deuce brims big in it, I'm bloated than Blimpy
Broades be blowin me in the back of the black Bentley
Never been about no babblin not bringing no bootsy
But I've been in the bay with big bond like shaboobalaboopy!

[Verse 5: Bumpy Knuckles]
Yo it's the OG Bumpy Knucks, Knucks I rolls with them B. Boys
B' walkin' round strapped up-up
You can talk that killer shit if you want my niggas
Guarantee that you'll get clapped up-up
See I'm the beast, your the bitch, I'm better battling baby
Me and the blood Tech Nina saddled up-up
And for the record nigga, check mine and you will find
That I shit legendary status niggas up-up
Come on, to be like bump ya gotta be a big ball breaker (Pow!)
Crack a nigga whole rack I'm like a jaw breaker (Crack!)
Knock you out and and hit them pockets like a cold hand
I'll bust your motherfuckin' shit and I'm an old man
They said my music was Strange until I made
Me sum change and now they ridin' my nuts-nuts
Tech N9ne's out the window, you see them
KC Killers ridin' by y'all niggas better duck-duck!
Come on!

[Hook][Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
She love she love me not
But Ill never be all touchy lovey dovey for what he got
Suddenly kissy huggy what is for me the buddy slot
But they callin on me to put it right in the open it could be an ugly stop
Shes lookin to be caressed on the reg
Fetched on the reg
Sex on the reg
Only Techs on the bread
With nothin but busting percussion and checks on the head
As she huffin and puffin cause wasn't no Tech on the bed
And she don't like that Tech N9ne persona
Groupies more groupies for true the be juicy like John Bedushi
Like the one that do movies
Man ay caramba you google me I'm beyond the boobies and champaignya
Bumbaclot don't shrug me cause I'm the rapper but again you fond of da slacker who's been on your love
Peace in your honor
Just trusting can calm ya
She stoned
Now I'm home
But she gon love me mañana

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Can't stand to hear my name or see my face
But everytime she does she feels disgraced
But she gon love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)
Love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow) x3

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
What kind of fan are you
Just because I expanded you ban a dude like soft musical Xanadu
But I'll be damn if you slander who Tech N9na
My crew cannibals ain't no fan of a true man
Who do a lot in a jam or two
Said I'm a sell out cause I worked with Wayne
First your brain need work
You hurt the game
Every lyric that blurst put the earth to shame
How do we burst to fame if both of our verse the same
We supposed to be different
You know that we gifted
Cause what we spit
You know that we live it
We grow cause we vivid
You's a fair weather fan
Your predictions will never stand
Like you know something better than when I'm chopping
Whatever man

[Spoken]
I told my fans, that, I told them this years ago. I said Tech will never go mainstream, mainstream will go Tech

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
I hear ya saying that I ain't the same
But in order to grow you know you got to change
But you gon love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)
Love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow) x3

[Verse 3: Big Scoob]
Here today but be gone when you blink an eye
Constant drinking got you thinking and you about cry
I was forsaken life taken can you feel the pain
Heart breakin body shakin can you stand the rain
I was a friend of thee but treated like an enemy
But now I'm gone just a portion of your memories
But in your memory 'member this vividly
There was no other villain from the hood real as me
From the soil none loyal like the B.I.G
Homie from the show me hope thats how you 'member me
And we'll soon see I ain't got long to be
On this earth claiming turf running in these streets
I apologize homie look me in my eyes
Time to turn the page be a man and swallow pride
Too many homies died before I got to say my piece
So I just said my piece and hopin that it brings us peace

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Today is gone and I left this place
But I'll be the sun shining on your face
So just love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow
Love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)[Hook]
Watch yo mouth when you're talking to me
I'll knock you out (C'mon! C'mon!) Piece definitely
I hold it (Down) for my block, for my hood, for my sector
Look at what ya mouth got ya, niggas should've held it (down)

Watch ya mouth or you might get hit in it
One piece two piece dit-dit-dit-dit-dit (Down)
This is for the niggas from my section
Hope you learned the lesson
Bully niggas better hold it (down)

[Verse 1: Big Scoob]
Left, right, right, left, he's toothless
Not Cube but the Big homie's ruthless
With my two fists I can move this
And bout to prove that I can move it with my true spit
I'm locked and loaded I'm ready I'm heavy, lyrics so steady
This for the block Big homie 'bout to get it, mayne
It's time to get it my nigga, my villains spit it my nigga
And if you feel it my nigga then throw a villain, mayne
Veteran now bustin' with my strange cats
Krizza Kali Tecca Nis and my nigga Scat
Chasin' paper my nature we 'bout to sew up the nation
We keep it real while you fakin' now how you love that
Rather scrappin' and rappin' see I'm attacking the action
Big homie makin' it happen now shake it shake it, girl
That pussy poppin' and clappin' now I be tossing your cabbage
And you be watching the savage so come and get it girl

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Joe Vertigo]
Watch me as I rock through the pain, I walk through the flames, insane
With lyrical scatter and spit that'll splatter your brain
I'm tired of chatters get choppers to rattle your frame
We inn like Wendy's it's my way we robbin' the game
I'm throwin' them thangs, I swang with the pain, deranged
To vertical murders sho' dumpin' on niggas with Strange
Ring the alarm, the heavy fuckin' hitters on
My patients will scorn the heavy fuckin' spitters on
I'm postin' wit Tech, I'm postin' with G's in the back
My swagger so mean wit the mini machine on my back
For violence I fiend, I move with a team as a crack
Go loco for rojo, I put that mozzle to your back
And take you on a walk you won't come back from
I take you to the other side of the black sun
(If you disrespect, you'll die to regret it)
Ya fuckin' right Joe Vertigo said it for your mouth
Yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Don't you run up when I'm wit a bitch, mumbling bumpin' some shit
Talkin' bout rap when I'm just beginning
Chump, I don't do battles and this rap will outshadow your spit
Nothing's compatible with this wickedness
When I'm eatin' some niggas just keep beepin'
I guess they just heat seekin'
When it come off with disrespectful talk
You geeks weaken the Nina's the beast chief
And you heathens ain't street deep
So keep beefin' and get yo head tore off
So dim scram for sight of thee grim hand, the fight'll begin then
These niggas is rose pedal soft
This ten grand to rock with me
Him stand like he ought to be tin man
The guerillas'll blow his kettle off
With Big Scooby Joe Vertigo shit's groovy
With Kali big nick truly, nobody is gettin' through (Keez?)
You get woozy, Then out of your head through you
Derouted and shit, who beat 'em down and issued a 2 piece

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Krizz Kaliko]
You wanna battle me? Battle me
All that blabber and that'll be
Causin' you cavity, givin' you agony agony chatterin'
That'll be the reason for your batterin'
Screamin' loud but you niggas ain't matterin'
(Already warned you)
Then I can give it to you with singin' and rappin'
Don't think I can't be clappin' at your habitat
(If I harm you)
Then you must be weak and be frequently gettin' beaten deceit
And plus you a faggot now
Now (Down) how many MC's must get dissed
'Fore they all know don't fuck with Krizz
See I'm a boss boy, fuck around with hog style
The dudes click with Strange and get tossed boy
When I'm off of that
(?) the whole night, for niggas that came to fight, I'm like
Fuckin' with Kali, it might be trouble
Here come in Kansas City Shuffle

[Hook][Verse 1: Big Scoob]
Unleash me, let the world know who I'm is
I'm here to get it for the city with the head of the git
Repping Villain Dog'n venom bout to kill em again
If you missed me on the last one, where the f**k have you been
Gut of Godzilla, they don't make many realer
I'm a hard hitter, plus I'm good with the milla
This is God's picture, I'm tryna bring to you n***as
It's a hard mission, I don't have room for your feelings
See the road with me, or take a picture of the train
Bringing souls with me, of all my villains in the gang
Represents the team, I got the streets on lock
You ain't gotta like it, they gon love it on the block

[Hook]
And up in the morning, in the evening it's a twist, top by my down and my ride's so sick, Gangstas don't dance but we all do this
(What's that?)
Akka Damn Fool
Say what I want, do what I want, play how I want, live how I want, slang if I want, bang if I want
(And I'm strapped?)
Akka Damn Fool (Big Scoob,Damn Fool) x5

[Verse  2:Big Scoob]
I been drinking all day so I really gives a f**k, bout your man and your problems (b***h shut the f**k up)
I ain't listening but I'm wishing I could get up in them guts, but you bickering and b***bing (b***h shut the f**k up!)[Intro: Tech N9ne]
A.S.S.H.O.L.E
The word is mainly used as a profanity towards someone the speaker does not like, whose behavior is hurtful, self-centered, or particularly abrasive

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
MC's come around me talkin' 'bout
"Your stage show is off the hook" as I'm walkin' out
As if to say my performance is why they gawkin'
Outside that I'd be lost in doubt the lyrics
That a nigga be tossin' out
You motherfuckers can't see Tech, I mean be Tech
And these rejects lyrically don't got no electricity
We that quick-ily eject when your shit inside the CD deck
We just put in the dope shit we rep
Then we jet I mean split like a V-neck
Nigga that's disrespectful, never test the next bro
When he up the air like Craig Smith, Tech and Nesto
Standin' next to Necro we blessed to let flow, get dough
Even though you know we gets the pest-o
Kali say that it's a compliment
When they say that they love the show, but I spit that monster shit
All you mediocre rap motherfuckers tryin' to spit
I'll murder yours ya I'm an asshole when its time to shit, nigga

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
You can label me a asshole
Cause I'm fast puttin' yo ass on blast, I'm a natural
Call me sphincter, Little Stinker
You ain't touchin' me in this arena (NOOOOO)
You can label me a Asshole
Cause I'm fast puttin yo ass on blast I'm a natural
Little dook shoot, don't make me toot-toot
You don't wanna make me have to shoot poops (NOOOOO)

[Verse 2: Big Scoob]
Let me at 'em, nigga line 'em up, I smell pussy
These niggas funny, nigga battle rappin' and steady wolfin'
They barely eatin', but believin' they can see me heathens
Or be my heathens, best believin' it's gonna end with squeezin'
I'm not a rap cat gives a fuck about your vicious flows
Big homie stay strap with the force so I got heat to blow
But I don't freestyle and waste rhymes like half of ya
I'm still spectacular It's just a different vernacular
I'm disrespectful Gives a fuck bout your hip hop
I'm tryin' to eat you niggas meat, I'm coming for your spot
Fresh off the block and I won't stop until I reach the top
I'm Killa City's B.I.G. I'm guessin' Nina's Pac
Damn right nigga quoted and unqoutable
Any problems we can solve them nigga let me know
We the new niggas Strange Music takin' over
And there ain't nare nigga safe, nigga even Hova

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]
Asshole mio, I'm super sick and sodomize ya bride
My bad attitude will be my demise
Don't look me directly off in my eyes
I might get insecure bout what you starin' 'bout
Rip you fuckin' hair right out
Mr. Nice Guy I might seem when you meet me
But niggas might die if I'm deeming your speech beefy
Kiss him bye-bye if he ain't speedy to leave me
Had to nighty-nighty 'em cause a nigga seemed sleepy (What an asshole)
The world did it to me, staring at my face like it's playing a movie
Twist my lip off and my lip off, not polite time so that mean I'm soft?
You think I'm chicken I think your bitch is the dipping sauce
All I got is hard dick and bubble gum
Can't give ya neither one, you bitches is too troublesome
Yeah I'd like to sign my name on your poster
But don't slip me your demo it's gon' end up as a coaster
I'm an asshole

[Hook][Intro: Tech N9ne]
Mange Strusic! Bang bou yitch!
Follow me now see, check it out
I say: this song is dedicated to the ball droppers
But I'mma switch the letters around and say drall boppers!
We coming to get ya so get the message to all coppers
That you need protection or you better have ch'all yoppers!

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
What a shame when a thang blast at ya
Cause you're lame you're a dame slash actor
These dudes are ho's from screws to toes
They choose to go bass ackwards

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Tecca Nina bout to hit 'em wit the woop wop
Now the barrel of my governor is hoo tot
Cause you the type that'll get your whole shew crot
Loud mouth nigga trippin' thinking that he Putac
Got a strong hand, I'm a mown gran
Little boy, now you fuckin' with the clong wran
Oh you just showboatin'? It's over now y'all can quit
Cause you can get it for something mere as shalkin' tit
Just a cone phall, then it's on y'all
Fuck around and get ya dome sawed off a brone stawl
I can't wait to hear ya squeal and holler
How you set trippin' when you got a multi-dillion mollars, nigga
Stupid, such a sucker--
Nuck figgas always got to make a totha bruch her
Never had no problem takin' down another buster
Cause they be doin' shit bass ackwards futhamucka

[Hook: Tech N9ne] (x2)

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
I'm Yo Gotti, the drug dealer
I'm Yo Gotti, the thug nigga
I'm Yo Gotti, my own hitter
And if you wanna ODX, then say Yo Gotti the plug, nigga
I've been getting money for a long time
You've been bangin' throwing up the wrong sign
Pussy ass nigga, you a cross gender
Fuck boy, you a ho nigga
And you remind me of my ho, nigga
Nothin' I hate worser than a broke nigga
Got a Tec-9, and an AK, and an FN
Got a white Vette, and a white Ghost, and a white Benz
I ain't runnin' with niggas, 'less I'm gettin' money with niggas
I don't act funny with niggas, keep it a hundred with niggas
Kept a thousand with niggas
I ran in houses with niggas
I put in work with the squad, we even sold flour to niggas
But, fuck

[Hook: Tech N9ne] (x2)

[Verse 3: Big Scoob]
Bass ackwards, synonymous with rappers
All these niggas claiming maintaining that they factors
When'd you push a package? When'd you ever clap shit?
All these niggas talking ain't done nothing but this rap shit
Reason why I shook this place and had to find some space before
I killed one of these rap niggas and ate they fucking face
Outta place in this rap game, biggest mistake I ever made
Hit rewind and de-line, deleting everything I layed
Far from a rap nigga, I don’t lie for fun
Fuck fame, and fuck you, and fuck him, and her too
Nina called the big dog, I had to breathe smoke
But Yo Gotti and Big Scoob and this ain’t 'bout dope?
Bass Ackwards

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
These niggas ass backwards
She let me hit that ass backwards
Pussy niggas act hard, get killed for bad acting
Trigger man laughin'
It's funny how this shit go
Redrum was the case that they gave me
I sipped slow and stumbled down a slipped slope
I could hide the chopper in the trench coat
Tunechi go berserk in this bitch
Spellin' stressed backwards, dessert with my shit
I'm reversing this shit
My double R & R, I park on the curb in this bitch
The money, I'm submerged in this shit
So frankly, I'm stalking Ben Franklin
I am Wayne Carter, oops, I meant Cayne Warter
Cocaine on back order
Flip you ass backwards
Bitch you are bass ackwards if you think that's awkward
Strange Music[Intro: Tech N9ne]
B. Boys and B. Girls stand up

[Hook: Tech N9ne] (2X)
Swing first, I'mma destroy

Cherried up, got 'em P'noid
Let the whole world know, I'm a B. Boy!

[Verse 1: Big Scoob]
I watched Snoop do it, he let that blue flag hang
So watch Scoob do it, I'mma let the brown rag swang
Middle deuce to it, boy that's just a five six thang
Now SOO WOO! WOO! That's how we rep this gang
I ain't new to it, vill I got that bang in my veins
And I'm true to it, all I know is bangin' and 'caine
So get used to it, validation now I'm with Strange
OG villain off the block representer of them flames

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
I pledge allegiance to the flag, my united hoods of [?]
I'm certified, around the top banging was so influencing
I made it with my heart, a vendetta, in hopes of unity
And left out a with family, a forty cal and a newer me
Deuce click represent, red rag regiment
Red rope replicates, whips runt recreate
Rest won't recommend, refs don't let you win
Red Rider Warriors we reppin' to find the testament we

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Skatterman]
5"10', 235, hell of a left hook
Niggas think the feds came and got me when they got West Crook
A vent look, pull up stuntin' and get your vet took
Or we could stand mano a mano and get your best whooped
Knuckle up knucklehead, nigga been with this knuckle game
Still fuckin' with Scoob, Kutt and Kali, baby ain't nothin change (STRANGE!)
A drive for no paper work, organize drive-by's and your neighbor hurt
Send a couple down and hey you and your neighbor murked
Show you I ain't playin' fuck around and knock your neighbor first
It's Skatterman, pussy mortar just took virgins son
Who you think Tech gonna call to make sure that the dirt get done
Red cap, red shirt, red shoe strings
My .45 is a bitch, and I think she havin' mood swings (mood swings?)
You think them boys got guns watch what your dude bring
Fully auto AR-15, wipe out the Blue Team!

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]
Beats bangin' better bring it big or bounce bitch
'Bout to blastin' in blood I'm back in this black brick
Boss ball I've been breakin' bread 'n baguettes brie
And beautiful biancas, videos, and Vegas with big B
Bow before brilliance, blessed to be buildin' it
Best in this barrio bane and bazaar we more bills in this
Bankin' his babies be blingin' and his boo be that big booty!
Big bust! Be in his benzo bronze and get big bucks!
I'm a black baboon, bring me bags of bananas
Bonefied, billy bad ass with a brown bandana
Been gone on Bacardi 'bou lou but I'm bout to be bigger bent
Better break if you bustin' before I'm blown and belligerent
Six deuce brims big in it, I'm bloated than Blimpy
Broades be blowin me in the back of the black Bentley
Never been about no babblin not bringing no bootsy
But I've been in the bay with big bond like shaboobalaboopy!

[Verse 5: Bumpy Knuckles]
Yo it's the OG Bumpy Knucks, Knucks I rolls with them B. Boys
B' walkin' round strapped up-up
You can talk that killer shit if you want my niggas
Guarantee that you'll get clapped up-up
See I'm the beast, your the bitch, I'm better battling baby
Me and the blood Tech Nina saddled up-up
And for the record nigga, check mine and you will find
That I shit legendary status niggas up-up
Come on, to be like bump ya gotta be a big ball breaker (Pow!)
Crack a nigga whole rack I'm like a jaw breaker (Crack!)
Knock you out and and hit them pockets like a cold hand
I'll bust your motherfuckin' shit and I'm an old man
They said my music was Strange until I made
Me sum change and now they ridin' my nuts-nuts
Tech N9ne's out the window, you see them
KC Killers ridin' by y'all niggas better duck-duck!
Come on!

[Hook][Intro: Tech N9ne]
Niggas mad at us when we come to they town 'n they bitches be on our dick
Nigga, don't come to us talkin' about that bullshit, nigga, over a bitch
Nigga, I fuck-, nigga, I beat you up, you bitch-ass nigga, for real
Three niggas on this track, Tech N9ne, nigga
Lebowski, nigga, from Tacoma, Washington
And the motherfuckin' Weapon from Kansas City, Missouri, nigga
Young niggas representin' for Strange Music
All day, all night, you pussy-ass niggas

[Hook x2: Tech N9ne]
When it's drama in the air (Imma beat you up)
You don't fuck with me, I don't care (Imma beat you up)
Anytime or anywhere (Imma beat you up, Imma beat you up, Imma beat you up)

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
This is anger
This is to anybody who say somethin' derogatory about a stranger
Meanin' Strange Music, or connected
It's bet that you just exit when your neck gets requested to get slit
Niggas be hidin' behind their MySpace
Irate, but get all buddy-buddy in my face
I hate, envious motherfuckers better migrate
Off into somethin' other than my state
If you was better than us, gettin' more cheddar than us
You would be measurin' up, you niggas ain't clever enough
All of you bitchin' because you wishin' you was in our position
Fuck you niggas, anybody, bro, we make the decision
Strange Music, Trav and Tech, havin' threats
From cyberthug-niggas yappin', shit ain't happened yet
Cause you fags in check, what do we need to be cashin' next?
That'll be your soul, motherfucka, cause yo' ass is deaf

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Lebowski]
This is hatred, and it goes to the next
Person who say Strange Music ain't a team full of patriots
Now watch how Strange do it, huffin' and puffin' and
Get you stuffed in the back of the trunk when I'm off the strange fluid
This goes to those who tip-toe and walk with a twitched nose
(Keep spittin' your bitch flows)
You mad cause our shit goes, we comin', you switch rows
Either stay up out of my hair or beware when my fist close
When my strength is endorsed, the force is enforced
And of course you'll be squirtin' the sauce, a burst in your torso
Therefo', I don't think you want it with us
Fuckin' around with my circle means you wanna get touched
Cause I been goin' through stuff and enough is enough
The intensity of my rage keeps on risin' up
On the mic or on the stage, I'mma eat you up
When caught standin' in my soil, I'mma beat you up

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 3: The Weapon]
* * * nigga when I'm off on the dance floor
Get * through your mouth just for wavin' your hands, bro
Thirty niggas deep, we a squad full of g's
The shit-starter, shit get funky, you can call me Febreze
Yeah, Weapon, motherfucka, I can bond with Strange Music
Nigga, I'm a veteran, put drink in a strange fluid
Silly little nigga with a criminal mind state
I smuggle in some chops, it's used to raise the crime rate
When shit kick off, you run fast like a cheetah
Choke him out with my wallet chain 'till he havin' a seizure
Yeah, Grey Goose bottle, plus that bitch on yo' forehead
Your bitch with you? Mine too, let's battle * * *
My homies is mo' dead, I stumped * * too
Shake a nigga comfortable, * * * *
Jeweled up, flamed up, like the boy Messy
Leave your face smashed in like a bottle of Pepsi

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 4: Big Scoob]
Another entry from the big fella
My situation got me shakin' back at it since they snatched Yella
So it's time to resurrect a sleepin' giant, you dig?
All you pussy niggas in the game know what this is
This the takeover, big fella come to state his claim
Spark them heaters, spreadin' *, y'all remember, man
Real spit from a ville nigga with real hits
Real shit, man, I'm as real as real gets
From knuckle bustin', nigga, to let loose of the whole clip
Ain't no slackin', get it crackin', man, that's off the flip
And I got thunders on my word, man, they bring the harm
That's my youngins, I feed birds, man, they love the storm
Gutter fury, I'm Missouri like a fuckin' swarm
Killer City, hella pretty, pussies, you've been warned
And ain't no stoppin' this machine once you've turned it on
I'm tryin' to told you how I mean it through this fuckin' song

[Hook] (x2)Y'all done did it this time (Aha)
I ain't lettin that ride (ride)
(Yeah) Y'all done did it this time
Better not let me go outside

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
Say somethin' say it again, I dare ya!
I got somethin' that'll do a little more than scare ya
They say wear a raincoat or we might get wet
Well I ain't met a motha (HEH) who can do that yet!
Talkin that jibbity jabba bout to put some hot ones through us
Do somethin' to us, talk go through us
Your girlie wanna do us, the Snake and the Bat cats
She off some of that fluid, just for shakin that back fat
We come in peace, but you know we got our pieces
Can be the beast, takin out all 32 teeth is
Cuz church folks got limits to that limits you to minuscule
Words you can use to make criminals diminish you
Finish you and your women too, wet you like a swimmin poo'
That 80's baby face got 44's and turned to 88's
But keep em in my holster I'm supposed to be the nice guy
Don't do me like that, keep on poppin off then I'll be right back

[Hook]
Keep on disrespectin' me homie
And I'll be right back, I'll be, I'll be right back, I-I'll be right back
You done said somethin' slick to me?
And I'll be right back, I'll be, I'll be right back, I-I'll be right back
Back up, Back up give me room boy
And I'll be right back, I'll be, I'll be right back, I-I'll be right back
Told me, told me bust a move well
And I'll be right back, I'll be, I'll be right back, I-I'll be right back

[Verse 2: Big Scoob]
These slick talkin' disrespectful bad mouthing the gods
It's lil buddy thinkin gully I'mma give him his chop
Knock his hinges with the vengeance; so precise with the heat
Like Adam Jones from on the throne; I send my dogs to the streets
Young thundas wit' no blunders, make the hit then they wonder
Roguish villains made a killin? That's the question they ponder
Old head street villain with the tricks of the trade
I'f I'm Sicily my history a nigga be made
Well paid, legendary from my time in the field
I call the plays, I'm quarterbackin, I'm a boss in the Ville
Send em seein', chasin cream, movin dolo for green
Not what it seems? Call the team, have you blitzed like a fiend
Paparazzi's flashin choppies hundred pictures wit' papi
While I never left the party slammin liquor wit' mommy
Leave my message with this reference; I ain't givin' no slack
Slick talkin', disrespectful boy them dogs'll be back

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
YATES!
Why you yellin' on my phone like you major
Actin like you killin' your witness somebody paid ya'
If you really want N9na in ya spot then I can aid ya'
I'll be right back on tour then me and my rellies invade ya'
Nigga I got riders in Fresno, never scared to let lead go
Your message was womanish betta yet it sounded real lesbo
Like a gay woman you trip cuz anotha bitch said so
Just tell the truth you trippin' cuz I'm reppin that red though
But don't be actin like you don' know C-Bo is my family
And you claimin' West Coast Mafia soundin' real Ghandi
C-Bo don't be runnin' wit niggas feelin' dandy in panties
Instead of a man these pansies hand me a shanty
Stop callin' me from a private number violent gunner
In a silent slumber, die and it wonders, rise at thunder
Is it because ya chick gave me a night cap and you don't like that?
Well don't worry homie my tour is comin I'll be right back

[Hook][Intro: Krizz Kaliko]
Well alright, heh-heh-heh, this one goes out to all my hustlers
Out there in Kansas City, doin' your thang, baby
You already know this nigga, man, he's been run around here for years
Hustler, this is theme music and every can hustler must have some
His family is folks, they call him Scoob, baby, but y'all know him like

[Verse 1: Big Scoob]
Big Scoob, that my nigga rippin' it up
Put the hood up on my shoulders, man, I'm liftin' it up
Tip in my cup, still a nigga givin' a fuck
You can get touched, pussy nigga spillin' them guts
Man they wanna see the boss don
I be stompin' on the hardest streets they walk on
Old nigga but my knuckle game is still on, it's still strong
You can test it nigga, watch me get my vill on, yeah
I ain't changed nigga, hungry for bread, left me for dead
Duckin' dodgin' shakin' the feds
But they missed nigga, so I'm back searchin' for mine
Fresh off the grind, still gutta sick with these rhymes
Flippin' these lines, you can see the truth in my eyes
Never no lies, leven vill screamin' with pride
'Til the day that they rest me, hog stylin'
Gutta livin' villain that's me
(Tell 'em who you talkin' 'bout)

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko] (4X)
Scoob, Big Scoob, Scoob
Scoob, Scoob, Scoob
(Scooby-Doobie-Doobie-Doo)

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
The way I drink heavy when I party and shit
The way I disrespect a bitch and say sorry and shit
The way I make it switch it from red to dookie brown
Spot a curve and dope boss dogg and lay 'em down
On the roads and be no lost cause and wait around
Show them hoes there'll be no toss drawers 'til you pay the hound
The way I refrain from hangin' with simps
And never fuckin' with shrimp that ain't deveined
The way I smash for the cash, the way I mash harder (Flash)
Caught a broadcast on the blast with a last broader
Why I'm half martyr, the reason I take showers
Cause I don't like sittin' in my ass water
My reason for red chucks and red laces
My reason for fuckin' up and never catchin' fair cases
The way I go so hard on the liquor
Vill livin' is a given and create it because of my nigga

[Hook] (4X)

[Verse 3: Big Scoob]
Mayne I'm back and I'm hungry
Big homie from the show me niggas know me
Only villain take a yic and then I cloning
Real talk I can give it how you want it
I can put you niggas on that 5-6
Villain niggas movin' the crowd and I'm tryin' to make strange
Put some hog in they style, dogg and I'm wild
Vans left the bark on the ground, stompin' him out
Pussy nigga runnin' his mouth, but for now I'mma changed man
OG so I'm stickin' to the game plan
Takin' papers, makin' moves like a grown man
Vill steppin' in the seven first up for the field plan
And you can get it if you want it with me
Definitely, I can give you more than you need
Gutta livin' and I'm screamin' the V, wherever I be
That's how you niggas know that it's me

[Hook] (4X)

[Outro: Krizz Kaliko]
This has been brought to you by big old of cup
Of a billion finest Canadian whiskey, take a drink, man
We're the party and kickin' it, baby
On this album, you know, ain't nobody gave me a dollar, a nothin'
And I'm comin' up to Big Scoob
You know I did hustled, man, I need some money, man[Intro: Krizz Kaliko]
I'm drunk as ever baby
Where the Hennessey
Scoob! Salue!
Twiztid! Salue!
Kali!

[Hook]
I’m filling up my Dixie cup
Throwin’ up and I’m liquored up
Stumbling and I’m spilling stuff
Like hell yeah (Hell yeah!)

Double fistin’ my Dixie cup
Twiztid and I’m liquored up
Toasted and I lift it up
Like hell yeah (Hell yeah!)

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
Put your cups up and I’m drinkin’, tryna get fucked up
They buyin’ it for me, I lucked up and looking for Scoob
They showin’ cleavage so free drinks they can get to receiving
But I ain’t buying cause you ain’t leavin’ with me
What I’m gonna do?
I’m off in the dark and now I’m on clear, I don’t drink any beer
I try to cut ‘em off they keep handin’ ‘em here
Now I’m too drunk to steer
Get drunk like we’re supposed to
Pop off the top of the oranges make some mimosas
But when I get closer she tell me she goes to shows, and lifts her clothes up
Salue! Drink until my face is black and blue
Tippin’ the waitress so she gon keep on goin’ by you
I’m off that KC tea, Caribou is super dew
I tryna get drunk as a skunk so any liquor will do, Kali

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big Scoob]
Scoob
Drunk as fuck right now, I ain’t lyin’ nigga
Been sippin’ all night, I’m prime nigga
Drunk and stupid, ‘bout to lose it, did I say I’m stupid?
Old Job, me and Brook how we keep it movin’
Look at daddy, brought my body, colours rossipatti
Mr. Potti when I’m pissin’, help me somebody
Almighty if you listenin’, help me please God
I’m outside, ‘bout to drive, can you steer the car?
Lift the door head spinnin’, I ain’t getting far
Pedal to the metal, rebel so I’m pushin’ hard
Pistol cop, tryna make it back to the block
Running red, tires spin, must evade the cops

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Monoxide of Twiztid]
I guess tonight’s the night that we blame it all on the Dixie cup
It’s barely 6 o’clock and already I’m feelin’ super drunk
And like my spirits her shirt keeps liftin’
And if I had to sum her up with one word
Bottles are poppin’ and everybody’s wonderin’ if we’re gonna stop
All I keep thinking is “let me keep drinkin’
Until I go puke in the parking lot"
Bunch of them call the cops
Now I gotta find another way to get my shots
I don’t remember which way I came
So I’mma stay and wait for Madrox

[Verse 4: Madrox of Twiztid]
Pour me up, I do what I want to with my Dixie cup
Keep it 100 proof ‘til I’m drunk and stuff
Cause I’m over at the bar tryna love a slut
Cause I like to cut and I’d put it in her butt ‘til I bust a nut
Cause I’m crazy like that so don’t you know
So I puke a little bit and blink my eyes
Tryna see if I can that six piece home
Ciroc and Grey goose, three olives
I'm vodka friendly, rumchata by the bottle
Bottom’s up on my liquor medley
Mixologist, my apologies for drinkin' you dry
So put the bill on my tab, and throw the deuces, it's time to ride

[Hook]{Big Scoob:}
Hey yo, drop it like it's hot, Kane, drop it like it's hot
Yo, pick up the microphone and gimme what you got
{Big Daddy Kane:}
Hey yo, drop it like it's hot, Scoob, drop it like it's hot
Pick up your microphone, it's time to rock the spot

(x2)

(Oh my god, tell me, is it really him?
The legendary lyricist makin matters grim?)
Because when I start to flow the results are so deadly
Rappers start shakin like the legs on Elvis Presley
Sayin (It's him, the great) that's how I intimidate
But I just came to get my shit off, so I give them a break
And pickin up the microphone after I left
Is like givin mouth-to-mouth to a corpse, a waste of breath
In other words, I don't leave no remains for you
(Forget the men, that's the evil that Kane'll do)
I bring it raw, gee, too hardcore, gee
The only way you could fuck with me is in a orgy
The magnificient, none can come swifter than
Cool as ???, but my skin color is different
We got the milk and honey
My rhymes are just like Abraham Lincoln's face (on the money)
Makin me freshest on the land, but let's not forget
That if I rapped under water they'd be Aquafresh
The best, oh yes, I guess... (wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
- You said that shit in '88)
Oh, I originate and create the great to dictate
And regulate chumps and set em straight
I get my point across because the boss is truly yours
The source to the force, so put it on pause
The one that assures applause, never took a loss
Stronger than some Olde E quarts to a can of Coors
In other words it's hazardous to your health
So don't do it to yourself

[Hook:]
Don't do it to yourself, don't do it
Yo, you better not do it, you better not

(x2)

(Stop right there, you better freeze, cease
Don't make me put my Timberland boot to your grill piece
Big Scoob from Brooklyn comin through, don't start me
Don't make me turn your jam into a tec-9 party)
Hey yo, what in the world would ever possess you
To think that you could touch me
Or even try to come above me
Or even think that you could flow this lovely?
Nobody, and I mean nobody on this whole planet can stand it
I rip it apart, and flip up the art cause I'm the best, damn it
I crush rappers for the hell of it, defeat, I never tell of it
So anything else you heard is irrelevant
(You're not on the level) man, you're not even close to me
(Step to the Kane) and get bagged just like grocery
So spare yourself the misfortune and proceed with caution
Cause I don't just burn rappers, I torch em
With a skilled-out style that's mad diesel
And I got hemorrhoids from shittin on so many people
I crush those who oppose with blows to your nose
When it comes to my crew (that's the way love goes)
The Chocolate City for Black Cesar Incorporated
(And all of the soft get faded)
So before you step to me use your head
And you better think about it more than Special Ed
Cause trust me, kid, it ain't like goin against anyone else
I'm tellin you, don't do it to yourself

[Hook][Hook] (2X)
Down for the
Down, down for the block
Down for the
Down, down for the block
Down for the
Down, down for the block
Down, down for the block
Down, down for the block

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Down for the block like Shaq O'Neil
Me and my niggas hitting corners in the Batmobile
My block so hot so keep you enough shots
You slip and you fall niggas get chalked like hopscotch
On my block I'm in cahoots with what's going on
Take me out the hood but the hood will never leave me
I'm holding on as if I'm falling off the edge of a cliff
If I live to see 80 I'm reppin' the bricks
Real shit leaning like a syrup sipper
Henny and sprite mix it up get a cup nigga
Pour out some liquor for my niggas who ain't living on the surface
After the bottle we load our clips and put in work
Block shit stay in the house when they set tripping
A hundred rounds hit niggas and wet women
East side 9-double-0-5-9
Watts, California, I ain't hard to find
Shit I'm down for the block

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
I'm down for the block like I'm down for my wife
And if you niggas fuck with either, then it's down with your life
I got no mercy for your fuck ups or the way that you behave
And represent that from the cradle to the grave
On my partner he was taught you got to get it how you spit it
Shoeboxes throw rocks hawk spit or talk shit
Killer city better watch ya might get set up by some hoes
Better do what Alvin Ailey do and stay up on your toes
Got the deuces and the Dre's click clacking in the paint
A hard method of survival try to shake it but ya can't
Rather win, lose or draw stand your ground and hold your weight
And if your still can see your ribs get ya weight up, quit your hate
Cause niggas know when in a food fight you wouldn't bust a grape
Spike clicks probably better off chopping with the K
I'm down for my block and I love my town
So Killer City stand up and Kutty Cal can stay hound

[Verse 3: Big Scoob]
Say the word, watch me bust your shit
I'm the realest motherfucker with this stranged out clip
Suck the willa on the realer, I ain't playing with you niggas
Godzilla with the milla get to spraying at you niggas
Yeah, check my history, nigga, when you mention me
Bet they say I'm in the street, ride her nigga for the V
Fuck the industry, fucking what you think of me
I don't give a fuck, bet you pussies be respecting me
I love the block, cause my sign in the prime time
You niggas faked your steady lying in your fucking rhymes
Saw a nigga, hella twisted off the R nigga
Gutter butter, I be seeping like a ball nigga
Dessert eagle for the people, I be busting lethal
Know the cola for the soldier, but this all legal
For the block, I'll be screaming villain non-stop
5, 6 on a mission take it to the top

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]
Ey, red drawers, red socks, red everything
Look what they've done to me crazier than I've ever been
Like I needed medicine, I don't think it's eratapheme
That is seen, second lettering
This ho-head plus wanted me to rep the block
Sadly I missed the block
Badly and the ones that came before me Dr. Bop and Rock
Daddy, plus being surrounded by real niggas was my big thrill
Cause I was walkin by stand-up niggas from 56 Ville
They helped me get my cheese up, love my K-I-D's much
Thats why I would never freeze up when its time to throw B's up
We need a Jesus to relieve us when millies bust
Now we're over seas plus with euros and visas
58th, 57th, 56th, 55th
That's my area and I rep it with the quick
How many homies it be grips and they on the sippy trip
Down for the block and it's the same shade
As the homie Mitchy Slick, nigga

[Hook][Intro: Tech N9ne]
First entry for Sickology 101: Dysfunctional

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Yeah, don't you bring me nothing stupid
If you don't want me to lose it
Step back if you don't want me to attack
I'm a beast, better give me the deuces
I have no tolerance for nonsense, get away from me
Nina wanna get dollars
Don't wanna holler but you makin' me
I'm a little dysfunctional
You're the problem, please don't awaken me
And I'm that way cause back in
The day most have forsaken me
La-di-da-di, I'm at the party
On a drunk night with a punk, might dudes
Tryin' to pick a fight because he's sorry
That he ain't Gotti, like I be, cause he
Sloppy, not me, costly rocks be spot free
But he don't know I'm roguish
Surrounded by my soldiers
And they be locked and loaded
Will explode if you can't hold us
And we don't got no scruples
We didn't come to fight and shoot you
But you busters better be mutual
Don't get loose because we cuckoo
Listen, they call me genius, I run the show
Women be on my penis, it's wonderful
Demons think they the meanest
But I brung the foe on the floor
Little bit sick, don't you know?

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
I'm a little dysfunctional, don't you know?
If you push me, It might be bad
Get a little emotional, don't you know?
If you fool around and make me mad
I'm a little dysfunctional, don't you know?
If you push me, it might be bad
Get a little emotional, don't you know?
Might fool around and make me mad
Don't make me mad

[Verse 2: Big Scoob]
Born to hustle, I'm a product of environment
The game done changed, so I've been forced into retirement
But I make moves and I paid dues and I got common sense
Since I can't lose and I can't choose, then I'll come back to spit
I got hit songs but I've been gone so long that I don't fit
Kneeled at the throne, but can’t get on, so I need me a lick
I write these songs but don't belong I'm on some other shit
I'm huntin leads in desperate need, I hope it's comin' quick
I'd wrap my brain to find a lane that's gon' bring me some change
But it's so strange, my life has changed and I am not the same
I come around but since I'm down, it feels uncomfortable
I try to hide it deep inside but I'm dysfunctional
I never learned to hold it in, I gets emotional
First, implode and then explode, I am combustible
So please don't push to play me, pussy, on some real shit
Won't be defeated if I'm heated, nigga, oh shit!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]
I ain't no killer but don't push me
Goody-goody choir boy never been no pussy
Could be carrying something up under my hoody
Krizz would never snap and kill a baller, y'all, or would he?
Now I wanna be peaceful, but I carry Desert Eagles where
Ever black people are, you know how black people are
I peep 'em out, try to stay evened out
Wanna preach to 'em but their evil keep on seepin' out
Emotions get the best of me, messed up
And then y'all get the rest of me
Depressed and stressed, feel like my destiny
I know y'all think less of me, cause I'm always sick
And I can't let it be, pharmaceutical soup be the best recipe
It's gon' be the death of me, I need depakote
Just to cope, while I keep throwin' them pills down my throat
Dysfunctional blunts will do Smokin' Bombay
Can give me Fung Shui, but I wish that it all would go away
Or maybe I should pray for Jesus Christ to just un-pretzel me
Tryin' to pray for change, but sometimes it feel like he lets it be
So I just take another couple doses, probably be fine
But if you get too close you'll find out that I

[Hook][Celph Titled]
[Big Scoob]

[Yeah, uh huh, Big Scoob, Celph Titled, let's go]

(Chorus)
[Son I'm from the place where we floss regardless
Cars clothes, we ball the hardest]
Dog I'm from the home of palm trees and low rider trucks
Where we let the bass thump and don't give a fuck
[So that's how you get down?]
Oh that's how you get down?
[Man this is how I get down]
Nah this is how I get down

I keep it filthy as fuck and live the life of a dog
Catch me in the club with your wife when your favorite songs on
You poppin' the Cris? and I'm popping your bitch
When you out buying fifths I'm polishing a four fifth
Add another scuff to my kicks, think I give a shit?
I wore the same pair of Tim's since '96
Even my Nike Air Max is deflated
With holes in my socks and mildew rotten shoe laces
And I still bag more broads than ya'll niggas
Even though I borrowed all the clothes in my promo pictures
I say Big Willy, you can't stop the rain?
I wear dirty undershirts full of pasta stains
And shave maybe once every two weeks
I'd rather utilize the blade to put a scar on your cheek
I rock promotional shirts even if the group's wack
So don't be surprised if you see your logo on my back
I don't need to floss for sex
In fact my averex got electrical tape holding the zipper in place
Iced out only, after I robbed you
And it's bling bling when you see the snub knob through

(Chorus) x 2

[Son let me tell you why I dress so big
Ice on my neck is so damn big
House and my cars cost so damn much
And the rims on my truck just can't be touched
All my bitches got bodies like them chicks on cable
I got about a hundred hoes up in my stable
I'm not just Johnny nigga call me famous
Any more Cris? we drink til we piss
I don't bop when I walk [Why?] Cause I don't walk
I'm in the Benz with the drop and I don't talk
Chickenheads wanna holler til they throat get hoarse
Little kids I give them money when the lights take course
All my guns spit shells like they ate sunflowers
You could take a blood bath or stand and take a shower
To me it don't matter, put holes in your bladder
Fill your body with led til you ten times fatter]

[Hook] x 2

[Celph you know I live like a real life king
Got three kid named Bling, Bling, Bling]
It ain't a thing I'm at the Grammy's with a wife beater
Drinking rum and cokes straight out the two liter
[Trendsetters, you do you I do me
I even eat frosted flakes mixed with bubbly]
It could get ugly, I'm taking fat bitches to the buffet
With coupons, with my uncle's suit on
[Big Scoob, I got a house full of hoes
A mouth full of flows, a pocket full of holes]
Ayo I got a lot of respect for all the real playeas
Whether flossing or not we still gettin' paper [still gettin' paper
Still getting' paper]

[Hook] x 2Uh-Huh

Young disciples with they sights on rittz I snipe those rifles
Thats how I moves never snooze keep my goons with me
A damn fool breaking rules when I'm off this whiskey
Life of the party good hearted but I gets retarded
This moonshine twists my mind makes my thoughts distorted
Its really party time but me I'm thinking more time
Drinking got me thinking but I'm thinking with this scorned mind

I'm talking megahertz I'm trynna feel the aftershock
I'm falling all apart I hope somebody help me

Need a gallon of orange juice my mouth so dry
If I pop another pill nigga I'm gon die
Zombiie
I probably wake up in a hurse
I'm going backwards in time watching y'all move in reverse
I sip lean, I pour that liquor up
I don't take care of my health I don't give a fuck
I'mma pop a molly, wild boy and get fucked up
Nigga when I wrote this I had a double cup and it was going down
Going down going down going down

Got a gallon of the crown
Pour a little out (pour a little out)
Best believe it's goin' down

Got a gallon of the crown
Pour a little out (pour a little out)
Best believe it's goin' down[Intro]
Christopher?
Christopher, it's time to wake up

[Verse 1 Krizz Kaliko]
I keep having dreams
Of you and
Me eating ice cream together
I wake up and scream
Because your not
Lying next to me forever
("you're gone" choir)
Soon my thoughts are putting you away is OK
I know that your with him so I guess ill pull an OJ
There he is
But I be curious
Is he touching you the same way
That I used to attack exactly like it was game day
I usually got good intentions but
Im kind-of relighting your house up like its incense
Nobody can put in their two cents
She's clueless
But still can get it
Anybody can kill or live it
I need them pills or a medic
If you was me
Would you still have did it
No
We reconcile in the domisile
Be good for a while but I keep thinking
Life is sometimes darker than it seems
But luckily its only in my dreams
Mama sing

[Hook Barbara Word]
Only in my dreams
See the world ain't it seems to be
In my dreams
Only in my dreams
What ain't real to you is real to me
In my dreams
Only in my dreams
Only in my

[Verse 2 Brotha Lynch Hung]
I used to love her so much
More than I love these cigarets
More than I love these internet (girls)
But it still ain't even went in her yet
Still ain't even a minute yet
Deal my dinner like any sex
Might've been off her like 20 sacks
Paranoid nervous
Waiting in the bushes
Waiting for her to push them curtains
Take em, making me dirt quick
Perfect I'mma murk it
I'mma soak it
Leave it seeping
Leak it
I'mma be eating it up like Peking
These things bout to surface
Her husband don't like me
I think he's cursed us
First just I'mma stab him
And put him up in them hearses
Worsens
He just thinks my daughter is a splitting immage
Wait to spit her
And didn't finish
Ain't this rigorous
If this finish
Lick my lips right after I finish
I might just turn it on me and use it
I feel like I'm pretty useless
So I'm sipping on these two fifths
Scraping off my tooth's
See death is not a theme
So I'mma lean out the bushes
What am I thinking
Wait mama's saying

[Hook]

[Verse 3 Big Scoob]
This must be a dream
I'm seeing things I've never seen in my life
No more fiends
I'm with the team that got me scheming for flight
In this dream it's all wicked
Man the dark is the light
The black is the white
It's different they don't follow my plight
Gutter gems and Gutter hems
I don't toy with the light
I'm not grim so to them I don't belong in this life
Spit it different how I lived it
When I be rocking the mic
Know rap it's spitting
Just my vision how I journey through life
So suck it up and keep it pushing
I'mma stomp on your haters
Enjoy my days rock the stage
And keep my faith in the sake
Don't get complacent can't forsake
In this world of replacement
I can taste it time to take it
All my life has been wasted
Some hate it some love it
But I'm building a team
A rock star Gutter music
Watch my life on the screen
An epic thriller like Godzilla
I get stripped from your screams
Please don't wake me from this dream
Man I love when she sings
Mama sing

[Hook][Intro: Tech N9ne]
If you at the rink put ya skates on
Roll with the nina celebrate and that the day gone
Just because the DJ ain't diggin and pumpin they song
Mediocre rappers pick tecca nina to hate on
And they do it all night and day long but when they see me that frowned up hatin face gone
Ain't no rah uh reason ya fronted ya should've just kept it one hunit learn how to make ya face stay stone

[Hook: Irv Da Phenom]
Why you comin at me like that, is it cause I came up you mad
Cause ya see me with all this cash (Keep it one hunit)
Homie it ain't no changin me
Yeah I'm still the same OG and on my momma I'm always be
(Keep it one hunit)

[Verse 1: Big Scoob]
One hunit that's the reason big dog was called
Representer of the five block
Villian nigga dog
Well respected in the crime knot
Way back to Paul's
That's my liquor store
My hood
Where I swing my balls
For you young niggas that ain't know that really don't know the name
Check my history eventually you'll get told the same
Nigga big dogs a damn fool a fixture in the game
And I play it by my own rules damned if I'mma change
I was raised in this gang bang
Lived through this gang bang
Homies that done died so I got pride in this gang bang
Fuck nigga bring it
If it's beef then I'mma eat it
I'mma beast and I'm conceded I have yet to be defeated naw
I'm indefeated that's a hard days work
Boy don't make me pull your skirt and show your pussy on the turf nigga!
I'm vill walkin' shit talkin' on this fucking track
Show me's finest
Show your highness how you love that

[Verse 2: Glasses Malone:]
Im a playa, ma'fuck haters, and this a thin line (shit) but thas what separates us
If they smart, they are the segregaters, team of Kansas city chiefs, wit a ma'fuckin Raider
Thats a problem in the makin', a problem in the matrix, people thats unplugged (man) would probably be the safest. So understand I hope this hood shit sacred, hand on the bible I shoot it out to satin, if he ever did say shit, I really would be finer, ya you heard me nigga, anytime cuz, still serving nickels, step ya grind up, I knew the game was dirty b'fore I signed up, ya this rap shit is circus full of clowns and, otha weirdos acting silly for the croud, then they think we all the same till my pistols get to plowin, so a hunit ain't enough, gotta keep it one thousand

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
It sounds like they wanna claim KC king
They can't advance in this game cause they weakling
When in the trap making penis that can't see things
Like me at marina grog and galey mane feasting
Party of 70 at the (fogo da'chao)
You niggas small time, me and travis mobilin' now
Holding us down almost everybody know what it sounds of
Tecca nina despite the hate you be throwing around
From now on they will not talk nay talk
And they family won't have to walk cross grave moss
I'm the king it because I mob boss pay cost
I pro ball on em they Rock Chalk Jayhawk
So bow down cause the king gets hyphy
If you slight me ain't no stopping the nina the almighty
Don't you see the snake and bat shining brightly
Keep it one hunit if your rappers don't really like me, fight me![Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
She love she love me not
But Ill never be all touchy lovey dovey for what he got
Suddenly kissy huggy what is for me the buddy slot
But they callin on me to put it right in the open it could be an ugly stop
Shes lookin to be caressed on the reg
Fetched on the reg
Sex on the reg
Only Techs on the bread
With nothin but busting percussion and checks on the head
As she huffin and puffin cause wasn't no Tech on the bed
And she don't like that Tech N9ne persona
Groupies more groupies for true the be juicy like John Bedushi
Like the one that do movies
Man ay caramba you google me I'm beyond the boobies and champaignya
Bumbaclot don't shrug me cause I'm the rapper but again you fond of da slacker who's been on your love
Peace in your honor
Just trusting can calm ya
She stoned
Now I'm home
But she gon love me mañana

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Can't stand to hear my name or see my face
But everytime she does she feels disgraced
But she gon love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)
Love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow) x3

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
What kind of fan are you
Just because I expanded you ban a dude like soft musical Xanadu
But I'll be damn if you slander who Tech N9na
My crew cannibals ain't no fan of a true man
Who do a lot in a jam or two
Said I'm a sell out cause I worked with Wayne
First your brain need work
You hurt the game
Every lyric that blurst put the earth to shame
How do we burst to fame if both of our verse the same
We supposed to be different
You know that we gifted
Cause what we spit
You know that we live it
We grow cause we vivid
You's a fair weather fan
Your predictions will never stand
Like you know something better than when I'm chopping
Whatever man

[Spoken]
I told my fans, that, I told them this years ago. I said Tech will never go mainstream, mainstream will go Tech

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
I hear ya saying that I ain't the same
But in order to grow you know you got to change
But you gon love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)
Love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow) x3

[Verse 3: Big Scoob]
Here today but be gone when you blink an eye
Constant drinking got you thinking and you about cry
I was forsaken life taken can you feel the pain
Heart breakin body shakin can you stand the rain
I was a friend of thee but treated like an enemy
But now I'm gone just a portion of your memories
But in your memory 'member this vividly
There was no other villain from the hood real as me
From the soil none loyal like the B.I.G
Homie from the show me hope thats how you 'member me
And we'll soon see I ain't got long to be
On this earth claiming turf running in these streets
I apologize homie look me in my eyes
Time to turn the page be a man and swallow pride
Too many homies died before I got to say my piece
So I just said my piece and hopin that it brings us peace

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Today is gone and I left this place
But I'll be the sun shining on your face
So just love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow
Love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)Bubba[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
I used to press my Dickies with Sta-Flo
Sold pieces for my reli chasin' peso
Now they want me with nothin' cause I let my pay show
So I hop inside of my Mercedes and let the bass go
On you hatin' ass niggas, I deserve everything I get, a creatin' cash getter
I ain't puttin the 2 on the 10 I'm makin' vast figures
You fags bitter mad wanna be fakin' class with us
How they thinkin' they gonna come and conquer us?
Little Mini Cooper hatin' on a monster truck
Ponder such, I'll have you up in yonder stuck
Not a nare not a breath a stutter that conjure a
Nothin', nathin', the ruger's penetration
Inside of ya head it was soundin' like it's bassin'
Boom bing bang on you haters in the game
Strange lane takin' aim ain't a damn thang sane
I get it in, want some drama? Well I can fit it in
We can make it so you're no longer a citizen
Suction, from beneath you we just a little dust'n
All because I'm bringin' the bucks in

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
They wanna leave me with nothin' (Uh-uh)
But they ain't talkin 'bout nothin' (Uh-uh)
So I ain't trippin' on nothin' (Uh-uh)
They come to get me I'm bustin' (Uh-huh)

They wanna leave me with nothin' (Uh-uh)
But they ain't talkin 'bout nothin' (Uh-uh)
So I ain't trippin' on nothin' (Uh-uh)
They come to get me I'm bustin', bustin' (Uh-huh)

[Verse 2: Big Scoob]
On the block it was hot to not to run from the cops
I used to cop and used to chop and dump my rocks at Ms. Scott's
And on the late night at Ms. White's I'm fuckin with Will
We used to play fight then one night we came up with Vill
Young thugs dump drugs nigga hungry for meals
Young thugs jumped blood nigga itchin' for kills
Shit was real in the field man this shit was too real
Lost my homies to this shit man this shit is for real
But nigga nowdays the streets they go hard on the hustla
All these pussy niggas rattin' so us real niggas suffer
Not plentiful for me no more it's hoes in the game
Since I smell when paper foldin' man I'm rollin' with Strange
Pour some whiskey party with me tell the Feds if they miss me
They ain't comin' for me now then nigga bet they don't get me
So all you muthafuckin sucka niggas wishin' me gone
Big homie Strange Music Resurrection I'm home

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Messy Marv]
All I do is sell dope and nigga talk bricks
Talk with bananas and tote clips
Ride around and smoke kush with the yurner on me
Drink them champagne bottles with the flower on 'em
All that talkin' loud, will get a nigga a hit
You see them cherry red chucks? Yeah I'm with the shit
Anyway I bounce out man I hit 'em up
And I'll lock up with you we could get 'em up
I still wear a gold grill 10 across the bottom
They call me 19-5 cause a nigga got 'em
Click-Clack nigga yanka get yanked on
There's been alotta hatin' nigga since I came home
Anything a nigga do homie it's federal
And come with football numbers in the level 4
They wanna bee a nigga dead man but nathin'
Tech fuck them muthafuckaz they could keep hatin'

[Hook]

(Remove this explanation, please)[Instrumental vocal loop: Tech N9ne]
Some gangstas wanna head blast, cause I run with the red rags

[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Free Uno Ace Capone. The homie Keith Fudge, I got your back homie
LETS GO!

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Crew, soo-woo
Nigga that's what we do
Who, be you
If you want funk me too

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
I'm bool as a bubumber
Laces in my shoes makin you wonder
Am I gonna act a fool or bring your crew thunder
Thinkin I pack the tool, the one I use on her
I ain't trippin but the old days got my mind glitchin
Like different signs that ain't my kind got they 9's whistlin
Like a nigga wanna find this and strip clips till my wines drippin
But nobody wanna do no crime they just talkin about rhyme spittin
When I'm at the movies, careful how you steppin to me
Cause I think who's starin at me wanna do me
Cause Im flamed up and soo woo-ey
Head crash, my head's bad
Cause I be thinking some gangstas wanna head blast
Cause I run with the red rags

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
I'm a motherfucking animal, red devil, Tasmanian
Bangins' in my cranium, Deuce Cique and five claimin it
Kansas City thang, from two clips at my range is bandana dangerous
You's crip when I'm sayin' it?
It's Soo-Woo business, then yous through nigga
Blood? I don't give a fuck if I knew you nigga
That's that 85 mentality, victim of your reality
Catchin, pumpin' that 7-11 in your fatalities
It's another nigga's wake-up, smoke water and drank up
Heavenly, blocks flames from 20's to the seventies
It's ballers tuckin' fed cash, to get you dead fast
Gangstas they head blast cause I run with the red flags!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
Uh, I'm just bicken back and bein' bool
You don't this feelin, look you fuckin with the realest
No, gloves no, mask look you know we bout to kill it
Disrespect us will get your mami pinned to the ceilin
This is still holdin hemi's even when I'm in my jammies
Niggas wanna catch me slippin leave me sleepin like a mami
Plus they still sendin threats, haters wanna pack me out
Bunch of internet hustlas always wanna run they mouth
I ain't trippin still thuggin for blood and getting guap
And you know I keep a oo-op let it sing just like a doo-wop
And it's always tough guys, they don't never wanna co-op


[Hook]

[Verse 4: Big Scoob]
Signed up, suited and booted, old nigga, ready for war
Layin back, stackin cake, but it don't take much to activate
Snatch it back and act innate, rainin' down the hand of god
Chopper get to sanging nigga smokin' like it’s El DeBarge
Forgive me Lord I'm trynna keep it cool
But I'm a old nigga with a quick fuse, quick to smell the bitch in dudes
Hard to walk in Scooby's shoes, do the shit that Scooby do
Fi' block, a general, I done paid my fuckin dues
Nigga this the life I chose, fuck that, life I choose
Still livin gang rules check the laces in these shoes
Gangsta nigga through and through, tried tested been approved
On blood, one love, nigga what, soo-woo
