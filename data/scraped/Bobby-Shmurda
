[Intro]
Ya'll tryna' make a next motherfuckin' scene up in here, huh?
It's like Shmurda she wrote
How much shmoneys that? Ah ah ahh, ah, ah, ahh
Ah, ahh

[Verse]
In Truey, I'm some hot nigga
Like I talk to Shyste when I shot niggas
Like you seen him twirl then he drop, nigga
And we keep 'em nine millis on my block, nigga
And Monte keep it on him, he done dropped niggas
And Trigger he be wildin', he some hot nigga
Tones known to get busy with 'em Glocks, nigga
Try to run down and you can catch a shot, nigga
Runnin' through these checks 'til I pass out
And shorty give me neck 'til I pass out
I swear to God, all I do is cash out
And if you ain't a ho, get up out my trap house
I been sellin' crack since like the fifth grade
Really never made no difference what the shit made
Jaja taught me flip 'em packs and how to maintain
Get that money back and spend it on the same thing
Shawty like the way that I ball out
I be gettin' money 'til I fall out
You talkin' cash, dog, I goes all out
Shorty love the way that I floss out
Free Greezy though, let all of my dogs out
Mama said no pussy cats inside my doghouse
That's what got my daddy locked up in the dog pound
Free Phantom though, let all of my dogs out
We gon' pull up in that hooptie, like we cops on 'em
With M16's, we gon' put some shots on 'em
I send a lil thot to send the drop on 'em
She gon' call me up and I'm a sick the hots on 'em
Grimey savage, that's what we are
Grimey shooters dressed in G-Star
GS9, I go so hard
But GS for my gun squad
And bitch if it's a problem we gon' gun brawl
Shots poppin' out the AR
I'm with Trigger, I'm with Rasha, I'm with A-Rod
Broad daylight and we gon' let 'em things bark
Tell 'em niggas free Meeshie, ho
Some way, free Breezy, ho
And tell my niggas, Shmurda teamin', ho
Mitch caught a body about a week ago
Fuck with us and then we tweakin', ho
Run up on that nigga, get to squeezin', ho
Everybody catching bullet holes
Niggas got me on my bully, yo
I'm a run up, put that gun on 'em
I'm a run up, go dumb on 'em
Niggas got me on that young shit
Got me on that go dumb shit

[Outro]
Got me on that go dumb shit, man
Trap mode in this motherfucker, hotter than a bitch
Ayo, pour up, I need some more drank[Intro: Rowdy Rebel]
Oh, They want that hot shit
All these social networks and these computers
Got these niggas walking round like they some shooters
See them in real life they trying to bust maneuvers
Like pussy talk that same shit from your computer

[Verse 1: Rowdy Rebel]
Just picked the cash up, they had the boy medula
Call up my broski Gene, like call up the jeweler
I just spent some cash on a pinky ring
Just made some brand new shmoney, it'd wasn't a fucking thing
And bitch I'm heading to your city
Just to clap up all them bitis
Me and JJ went from 50
Filled up the gas tank it was empty
We heading out to Philly
Smoking Fronto, bitch no Phillies
I got racks all in my Billies
Shout out to Slice, that's my Billy
For Kokane Shyste I'm getting trippy
Right to the other side with my guys and get busy
I'm shooting up the streets not the gym
I'm shooting at these suckers, not the rim
2Pac, Above The Rim
Put two shots in his chin
Ran down, he jumped the fence
I ran down in my Timbs
Saw the pussy through the tints
I was in that boy Memph Benz
With some shit that extend
Put two shots in his friends
For Kokane Shyste, I go in
For Shyste, I go in
Free my dogs out the pen
They shooting shit, Jeremy Lin
RIP that boy French
He still in Vegas with my friends
Buying out the bar, still going in
Flying down a mother fucking strip
And I got court on the fifth
Tell the DA suck a dick, not coming in
Gingerbread bitch
On the road, headed to that bread, bitch

[Interlude: Rowdy Rebel]
Brand new shmoney
Bitch, I just got some brand new shmoney

[Verse 2: Bobby Shmurda]
So you wanna talk shit and run your mouth
You wanna see my black ass right in front your house?
With some Shmurdas and the flag wrapped around my mouth
I ain't come to talk, I came to bang it out
Just called them thangs up, they begging, "Bro, don't shoot him"
But once he disrespect, it's like I gotta do him
I just spent some cash on a 40 Glock
And my nigga Killa ran through like 40 Glocks
And I'm headed to your block
Just to unload all these Glocks
My AR hold 30 shots
That's word to Kane, that's word to Hot
Bitch, I'm hated by many
So I gots to keep the semi
For Kokane, we pour out Henny
Cause for Kokane, we done shot plenty
I should say sorry to Ms. Penny
She caught me broad day in the street shooting Jimmies
I'm running niggas down in they jewels
I'm sliding over cars while I shoot
I think that I'm Tom Cruise
But, bitch I'm Bobby with that tool
I got that "bow", run up on him, act a fool
Make sure I hit you, you, and you
Got the drop, I let Monte loose
That's man downs in front the school
And we still trapping like some fools
Bitch, I been trapping up since elementary school
Told my teacher suck a dick, I'm selling food
I told my teacher suck a dick, I'm selling food
And free my daddy out the You-Know
He killed shit, bitch, grab a tombstone
RIP my nigga, Pluto
He still in Vegas with the bros
Loading up that thing, still smoking dope
Wilding on the mother fucking road
And I got court on the fourth
Told the DA lick my balls, not getting caught
Gingerbread bruh
On the road smoking hella dope, bro

[Outro: Bobby Shmurda
I just got a brand new burner

[Intro]
Girl, he got shmoney

[Hook] x2
She all about her shmoney, she don't fuck with broke niggas
She don't with broke niggas, she don't fuck with broke niggas

[Verse 1]
Lil bitch, go and shake that ass for these tips
Come bring it back and do a split on this dick
For a couple bands, she'll shmoney dance on this dick
Pussy so good, I went to France with the bitch
Damn, she look good when she back that ass up
Damn, I look good when I stack the cash up
I'mma lay a lil nigga now, don't forget it now
Pussy nigga good, boy, you know I tear it down
Broke niggas talking but I can't hear 'em now
Pussy niggas play, boy, you know I sit 'em down
Fool nigga play with me, I make his brains hit the floors
Smoke some good weed with my bitch and watch hit the floor
I done roll through the door, make some bands with the bitch
Like you never see me walk in holdin' hands with the bitch
I'mma lay a lil nigga, don't fuck with broke niggas
And she all about her shmoney, she don't fuck with broke niggas

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2: Bobby Shmurda]
Walk up in this bitch throwing C-notes
With some G Code, got her in the back yelling "East coast"
Little bit of Henny with some weed smoke
And some Clicquot , told my freak ho "Keep my drink, ho"
She gon' pop that pussy for the week though
Every weekend, tell her I need some pussy and some deep throat
She gon' do that thing until her knees broke
On the d-low, baby, we ain't through like 3 bros
(?) told my nigga go in beast mode, I'm in beast mode
Shooting niggas for the cheap, ho
Nigga only owed the nigga 30, yeah 30
Then I shot him with the eagle
Cause a nigga got a big ego, I’m illegal, bustin’ shots like it’s legal
Cops tryna find me like I’m Nino
I’m in Reno, geeking hoes down like I’m Z-Ro

[Hook] x2

[Verse 3: Too $hort]
Bitch boy, you can't tell me shit
I'm the kinda nigga she wanna be with
You the kind of nigga she likes right now
VIP and just spent 5 thou'
Get it right, welcome to the stage
Pull some cash out your pocket and watch her get paid
I know you tryna' hit that, if you ain't got enough dick for that
Big cat, she'll probably make you spend a lil more
Or maybe you should go
Silly ass pimps out there playing with these hoes
I'm a real one, ask her what she want from me
It's nothing, I'll show her how to get money
If he don't throw it in the air, he better not touch her
She don't love you, man, she nothing but a hustler
Fuck yeah, hell naw, she won't fuck you
Take her to your spot, boy, the bitch light rocks

[Verse 1]
And I'm down to catch a body, bitches, hit that hommy switch

But if I hit you with the shotty, bitch, I bet that body flip
Rasha caught him with them zombie tips and made his body spin
You niggas leap, you feelin' froggy, bitch, my niggas doggies, bitch
Run up on him with that forty, bitch and go retarded, bitch
Fuck ya feelings, ain't no sorries, bitch, no sorries, bitch
Shoot that nigga and his shorty, bitch, shorty, bitch

[Pre-Hook + Hook]

[Verse 2]
And I'm shootin' niggas left to right if they ain't steppin' right
My lil nigga keep that weapon tight, he'll leave you dead on sight
Look lil nigga, we the flexin' type, you feel like flexin', aight?
Put a bullet in ya head tonight, we leave you dead tonight
Tell that bitch I need some head tonight, I got my cheddar right
She said, how much you tryna spend tonight? I got the better price
I said, I can't even spend the night, I gotta catch a flight
But I still touch it down like Jerry Rice, Jerry Rice, touchdown

[Pre-Hook]

[Outro]
You already know who you speaking to man

Ain't shit man you know I'm chillin' how I'm chillin' and all that
Bobby, bitch, Bobby, bitch[Verse 1: Bobby Shmurda]
Let me tell you I'm conceited, bitch, I don't need a bitch
They be begging me to breed a bitch, but I can't keep a bitch
You know me, right after I beat it bitch, Imma leave it, bitch
I ain't even with the screaming shit, Imma freeze a bitch
Then ask Monte where my sneakers went, with the Beamer whip
Shooting niggas front of Keisha crib, right where Keisha live
Homie, tell me if you need a shift, I'm at Rita crib
CC2's like every weekend, bitch, ain't no sleeping this
Let me tell you 'bout my reckless life
I was selling white, homies 'bout to cause some wreck tonight
Ain't no check tonight, police looking for us left to right
Ain't no rest tonight, we on the run until the check is right
You get the message, aight?

[Hook x2: Rowdy Rebel]
Now what you know about that kitchen life
When we was pitching white?
People saying that our vision right, but we ain't living right
I told Bobby keep that pistol tight the way we living life
Niggas turn into that jealous type when you start living life

[Verse 2: Rowdy Rebel]
I'm living life like a boss
Bitch, take a photo and get busy with a star
I'm living large so don't know the total to my car
But I just know that shit real fast when it start
Shit, watch me take off, I'm a fool, I'm a dog
I'm a nigga that make music for a job
I'll drop a bomb on your big body cars
Nigga, what you thought? Bitch, I'm Rowdy, I go hard
With 30 bands then I blow it on the squad
Give a little bit of Shmoney to my moms
Remember when that nigga used to jugg and rob
Now we living large

[Hook x2: Rowdy Rebel][Intro: Fabolous]
Niggas got me on my Brooklyn shit
Aye, what I told 'em? I said
Being hot get you the MVP
Stayin' hot get you the hall of fame
It's Loso (Brooklyn forever!)
Shmurda, what up, son?
Brooklyn, what up, son? Huh?

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Yo, I hit my shmoney dance when I caught the lick
I hit my shmoney dance when I caught ya chick
I Bobby Shmurdered that when she came 'round
Threw the hat up in the air, it never came down
And I just caught that body like a week ago
Real quick, click clack, get to freakin', ho
She want some hot nigga chillin' out in Mykonos
Or thot niggas all summer, every weekend, ho
I ain't no killer but don't push me, yo
I had 'em killers in yo' bushes, yo
Them trick niggas splurge on the pussy, yo
You give me one day, I'll Purge on that pussy, yo
You ain't seen these kicks since like the fifth grade
Back when Bo Jackson and Ken Griffey played
On my 90s flow, nigga, Young OG shit
On my GSC, Meet the Family shit

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Can't hold you forever, you gon' get a date
Tell 'em free my nigga Critter Mate
Hold ya head to all my niggas in the state

Got the semi and fully on me
Gloves, mask and a hoodie on me
Case we need to steal a V, I got the pully on me
I know you shocked, right? They got me on bully, homie
It's fake love cause they really hatin'
For my downfall, they really waitin'
Hundred yardies, a hundred Haitians
I'm a hot nigga by affiliation

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Look, fresh up out the county, I done did a lil bid
Let the popos run up on me, I won't tell them coppers shit
All this money in my pocket, you might think I sold a brick
I got four hoes and some Hen, some low pros on my Benz
And if I catch that nigga slippin', I'mma shut him down
Let my homies separate his body, call that Seven Pounds
Better cool out, I'm nice with the hands
You keep talking that shit, I'll knock you out
A nigga be pickin' you up off of the ground for thinkin' you 2Pac
And shawty give me neck till I pass out
And she just gettin' checks cause her ass out
Makin' money, gotta be the fast route
Bitch, if you ain't fuckin', better get yo' ass out

[Verse 4: Rowdy Rebel]
Pow! Pow! That chopper make him Diddy Bop
Free Slice Billy, let my billy rock
And free A-billi, let A-billi out
When Flex drop a bomb on us, watch the city rock
Made Diddy shmoney dance right on Biggie block
Make him bring a hundred bands and the city out
When Fresh pull up in that brand new yop
Watch me slide off wit' ya thot cause I'm worth about a milli now
Niggas think cause we dancin' 'round, niggas won't get shot
That's Bobby Shmurda, not Bobby Brown, known to pop up on the block
These pussy niggas better calm it down, get the same drop from that thot
And these fuck niggas don't come around cause they know they gon' get shot

[Verse 5: Busta Rhymes]
Fuck around and get ya shit popped
Like hanging out too long on 91st and Winthrop
See, you the type to probably get got
See, this where all the fuckery nigga shit stop
Shawty climb this money mountain to the tip-top (get it)
Throw a hundred fifty on my wrist (watch)
Stayed with the heat, they call me Chris Bosh
Angry cause niggas see me leavin' the bitch block
Shout my nigga Web, shout my nigga Luger
Free my nigga Smiles, free my nigga Scooter
I suggest you probably pray to Buddha
Conglomerate and GS9 niggas full of shooters

[Verse 6: Yo Gotti]
Let's talk about a hot nigga
My dogs'll sit and watch, nigga
Fuck the judge, we never cop, nigga
Who the first to bring that Lambo on the block, nigga?
Poppin' Aces in the studio wit' Bobby 'nem
Before all the labels started callin' him
Cause bitch, I understand him cause I'm one of them
So know you hatin' on me if you hatin' on them
Memphis shooters, that's who we are
Made a million out a glass jar
Cocaine, I got dope bars
My nigga Snootie just caught a gun charge
Fuck a law, we gon' ride strapped, bitch

Broad daylight and we gon' let them thangs bark
Tell them niggas free Meeshie, ho

[Verse 1: Chinx]
Since I got the rock I been hard in the paint

Post on the block and them pistols is loaded
Ducking them cops, shaking them rodents
We started from that floor up
You talking money then show some
When I rose up, my dough’s up like yay
When it’s war time then them niggas gon miss you
Been a long time, now the money ain’t an issue
Court side seat, nigga brought his own whistle
Pushing that rock, running the floor
Killing em, that was my aim from the door
Most of my niggas they ducking parole
We keep it quiet, you making it show
These niggas wired, I don’t want to talk
Them niggas lying, they ain’t got no dope
They be complying, they side with the law
Stand with iron, I ride with the four

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Bobby Shmurda]
My niggas gon' break that, head tops
Everybody catching headshots when we bend blocks
Fuck around and get your friend popped when we send shots
Do you really want to test hot, I’m a ten top
Imma hit you with a chest shot till your vest pop
Hit you with the best Glock in your tank top
Shots falling like a rain drop in the same spot
Everybody want to bang hot till the gang hot
Bodies

None of my niggas ain’t scared to catch no bodies
None of my niggas ain’t scared to catch no bodies

When the Tommy get [?], can't top out
Drop a dime on my nigga, I’ll block out
Put them bands on your head and your man’s gonna be dead
Cause none of my niggas can’t top out
I roll with them niggas that ride for me
Shoot at a nigga and die for me
Homie take over your property
And all of my niggas so proud of me
And all of my niggas still different, there’s levels to shit
And I know that I’m shitting
Plus there’s money they're getting
You fuck with their money, they load up that Smith and (Blaow!)

All I wanted was a bank roll
So I went and got one
I don’t know what these niggas wanna hate for
I guess more money more problems
I’m just a young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll
I’m just a young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll, bank roll

[Verse 1: Rico Love]
It was all a dream, I used to read word on magazine
Niggas used to smoke, but now it's lean
Niggas used to dance in the club
Now they’re standing on the tables and scream
I bought a hundred bottles one time
I ain’t even drink shit
Champagne for the dimes, guess we got something in common
We both like pink shit
Diamond chain, white mink shit
80 thousand Cuban link shit
Made a mill off, they don’t know
From telling these hoes that lose lips might sink ships
Spent the weekend abroad with a broad
Her best friend, she brought friends, we’re abroad
Saved her name in my phone as Dior
And my dick get hard when Dior call
Might see me spinning off with a bad bitch
Screaming out one of Puff's adlibs
Take that, take that

[Hook]
Turn the lights on
All I wanted was a bank roll (bank, bank)
So I went and got one
I don’t know what these niggas wanna hate for
I guess more money more problems
I’m just a young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll
I’m just a young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll, bank roll

[Verse 2: Bobby Shmurda]
Pass that shit, nigga
Young nigga, I’ll be flipping that
So much different tracks, made a hundred for triple that with my nigga black
Goon sticks, I gotta stick with that, I gotta live with that
After screaming, free my nigga Champ
Get my nigga back
Lil my niggas, where my niggas at
Fresh money, we know how to act
Bitch, I’m hungry, where my dinner at?
Before I put a bullet in it, in your fitted cap
On the block, we was selling hard, we was never soft
Any niggas trying to get it off, we gonna get involved
If there’s drama what is hitting for, we gonna hit them off
Bang your block, then I let it off, then I'm speeding off
On the cops with a fancy car
Check my watch, it's an Audemar
Bitch, I ball like it’s no tomorrow
And my bitch, she like 44
But she a bad bitch and every time a nigga smash it
She got me screaming Diddy adlibs
(Take that, take that)

[Hook]
Turn the lights on
All I wanted was a bank roll (bank, bank)

Young nigga with a bank roll, bank roll

[Bridge: Rico Love]
She say, “oh, Rico, I love you so”
What you’re doing, I’ll never know
Maybe cause you had a soul
So fucking incredible, incredible
Father, forgive me for I’ve sinned
Father, forgive me for I’ve sinned
All I wanted was a bank roll
Father, forgive me for I've sinned

[Verse 3: Rico Love]
All I wanted was a bank roll
A hundred thousand dollars worth a bank roll
And I don’t need to smoke, but my niggas do
I just need a couple old schools, I can paint in gold
Driveway looking like the Grammies
My bae looking for her panties
Nowadays niggas buying stock
But back in my days everybody wanted candy
Spend us on a dropped top
Stopped at the light, but they still move
Head broke off, so far to the left
When the wave move on, they gonna fuck around and kill you
Now I got her phantom rose
But back then I couldn’t get her ... jaws
Got rich before I got famous
Sit naughty on my dick, like my dick got the antidote
It’s a gift just to see the light
Most niggas can’t handle those
My bitch had mosquito bites
Got rich, and I switched her for cantaloupes
Fuck living average
A nigga trying to live lavish
And every time I spend a million bucks
I stand up in my truck and I scream to these hot lips

Take that, take that
Turn the lights on[Intro]
You a fool for this one

Now they mad a nigga made it out the trap boy

Pussiess talking all that shit, can’t hear nobody

None of my niggas ain’t scared to catch nobody

[Verse 1: Chinx]
Since I got the rock I been hard in the paint
I be with them killers, them niggas that target your face
Post on the block and them pistols is loaded
Ducking them cops, shaking them rodents
We started from that floor up
You talking money then show some
When I rose up, my dough’s up like yay
When it’s war time then them niggas gon miss you
Been a long time, now the money ain’t an issue
Court side seat, nigga brought his own whistle
Pushing that rock, running the floor
Killing em, that was my aim from the door
Most of my niggas they ducking parole
We keep it quiet, you making it show
These niggas wired, I don’t want to talk
Them niggas lying, they ain’t got no dope
They be complying, they side with the law
Stand with iron, I ride with the four

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Bobby Shmurda]
My niggas gon' break that, head tops
Everybody catching headshots when we bend blocks
Fuck around and get your friend popped when we send shots
Do you really want to test hot, I’m a ten top
Imma hit you with a chest shot till your vest pop
Hit you with the best Glock in your tank top
Shots falling like a rain drop in the same spot
Everybody want to bang hot till the gang hot
Bodies
None of my niggas ain’t scared to catch no bodies
None of my niggas ain’t scared to catch no bodies
None of my niggas ain’t scared to catch no bodies

Or ten bodies
Bodies

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rowdy Rebel]

Hop out, the youngin' blow his top out
We drop out when my nigga pull that Glock out
When the Tommy get [?], can't top out
Drop a dime on my nigga, I’ll block out
Put them bands on your head and your man’s gonna be dead
Cause none of my niggas can’t top out
I roll with them niggas that ride for me
Shoot at a nigga and die for me
Homie take over your property
And all of my niggas so proud of me
And all of my niggas still different, there’s levels to shit
And I know that I’m shitting
Plus there’s money they're getting
You fuck with their money, they load up that Smith and (Blaow!)

[Hook][Hook: Uncle Murda]
Oh they don’t really want no drama

Lil homie ain’t stand a chance
I walked away doing the “I just caught a body” dance
Ah, ah, I just caught a body dance
I walked away doing the “I just caught a body” dance

[Verse 1: Uncle Murda]
Not the one to play with, yeah that’s my new name
In the club for dolo, they gon take whose chain?
Not the one to play with, yeah that’s my nickname
Shawty fell in love with me, blame it on the dick game
Her little box ain’t stand a chance
Hopped out doing the “I bodied the pussy” dance
Not the one to play with, rest in peace if you play with me
You getting money round here, not ok with me
Not the one to play with, I get it for the low low
Talking 24, Charles nigga’s 44 though
My bricks getting stepped on, that’s a no no
The fiends love my work like Puerto Ricans love Cotto
Not the one to play with, like Suge in the 90s
Look around, ain’t nothing but real niggas behind me
Not the one to forgive, [?] I ain’t forget
I’m still gone ride on them niggas that got Biggie hit

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Bobby Shmurda]
Talking bout bodies, we just caught another one
Now my trap hot, we gotta move before the warrant come
Youngin, athlete, we got to throw away another gun
Tell these nigga’s mom they got to throw away another son
Talking bout guns, nigga we just brought another drum
Hungry son, looking for these niggas with my Shmoneys son
Tweeting some', hit that nigga up and watch a [?] run
Squeeze a gun, Quavo smoked that nigga for the week ago
Not the one to play with, I live that [?] life
Not the one to play with, Freddy Kruger on the late night
Not the one to play with, Imma hit you and like eight guys
Not the one to play with, shoot these niggas broad daylight
Not the one to play with, cause I’m not the one to play with
Not the one to play with, cause that gun, bitch I stay with
Not the one to play with, cause my last name Shmurda
Not the one to play with, cause my uncle’s named Murda

It's a fuckin' celebration
They hatin' cuz a young nigga done made it

[Verse 1: Shy Glizzly]
All this cash and they can't take it

This OG got me levitatin'

Your bitch, she wanna give me top
Aha she guh cuz I won't beat the box
Go get my Cuban out the freezer box
If they shoot the Glock, just like a red fox
Ace of Spades, tell your bitch to come this way
Pistols in the body, do you wanna play?
You won't see a million niggas under me
I'm chasin' the millions just like Money May

[Hook: Shy Glizzy]

[Verse 2: Bobby Shmurda]
Bobby but my last name Shmurda
Since '08, bitch, we've been bangin' burners
Baby bro fightin' and took the Shmurdas
Free Lil Flock, he put that S in Shmurda (shhh, bow)
Drop that body, then it's adios
I see you fuckers like he gotta go
Don't fuck with me, I smoke a lotta dope
Come fuck with us, we get a lotta dough
Get so much pussy, gotta time it slow
I'm gettin' pussy from the finest hoes
It's too much texts, I'm replyin' slow
If you ain't tryna fuck, well bitch Geronimo

[Hook: Shy Glizzy][Intro: Rowdy Rebel]
Oh, They want that hot shit
All these social networks and these computers
Got these niggas walking round like they some shooters
See them in real life they trying to bust maneuvers
Like pussy talk that same shit from your computer

[Verse 1: Rowdy Rebel]
Just picked the cash up, they had the boy medula
Call up my broski Gene, like call up the jeweler
I just spent some cash on a pinky ring
Just made some brand new shmoney, it'd wasn't a fucking thing
And bitch I'm heading to your city
Just to clap up all them bitis
Me and JJ went from 50
Filled up the gas tank it was empty
We heading out to Philly
Smoking Fronto, bitch no Phillies
I got racks all in my Billies
Shout out to Slice, that's my Billy
For Kokane Shyste I'm getting trippy
Right to the other side with my guys and get busy
I'm shooting up the streets not the gym
I'm shooting at these suckers, not the rim
2Pac, Above The Rim
Put two shots in his chin
Ran down, he jumped the fence
I ran down in my Timbs
Saw the pussy through the tints
I was in that boy Memph Benz
With some shit that extend
Put two shots in his friends
For Kokane Shyste, I go in
For Shyste, I go in
Free my dogs out the pen
They shooting shit, Jeremy Lin
RIP that boy French
He still in Vegas with my friends
Buying out the bar, still going in
Flying down a mother fucking strip
And I got court on the fifth
Tell the DA suck a dick, not coming in
Gingerbread bitch
On the road, headed to that bread, bitch

[Interlude: Rowdy Rebel]
Brand new shmoney
Bitch, I just got some brand new shmoney

[Verse 2: Bobby Shmurda]
So you wanna talk shit and run your mouth
You wanna see my black ass right in front your house?
With some Shmurdas and the flag wrapped around my mouth
I ain't come to talk, I came to bang it out
Just called them thangs up, they begging, "Bro, don't shoot him"
But once he disrespect, it's like I gotta do him
I just spent some cash on a 40 Glock
And my nigga Killa ran through like 40 Glocks
And I'm headed to your block
Just to unload all these Glocks
My AR hold 30 shots
That's word to Kane, that's word to Hot
Bitch, I'm hated by many
So I gots to keep the semi
For Kokane, we pour out Henny
Cause for Kokane, we done shot plenty
I should say sorry to Ms. Penny
She caught me broad day in the street shooting Jimmies
I'm running niggas down in they jewels
I'm sliding over cars while I shoot
I think that I'm Tom Cruise
But, bitch I'm Bobby with that tool
I got that "bow", run up on him, act a fool
Make sure I hit you, you, and you
Got the drop, I let Monte loose
That's man downs in front the school
And we still trapping like some fools
Bitch, I been trapping up since elementary school
Told my teacher suck a dick, I'm selling food
I told my teacher suck a dick, I'm selling food
And free my daddy out the You-Know
He killed shit, bitch, grab a tombstone
RIP my nigga, Pluto
He still in Vegas with the bros
Loading up that thing, still smoking dope
Wilding on the mother fucking road
And I got court on the fourth
Told the DA lick my balls, not getting caught
Gingerbread bruh
On the road smoking hella dope, bro

[Outro: Bobby Shmurda
I just got a brand new burner

Free my nigga bobby man
Free my nigga rowdy man
Huh, Shmigo Gang

Get popped like a kettle, hit you in your cerebellum
I'm seeing stars in my panamera
We went through the pain, but we never let up
Yellow corvette mustard, lambo red ketchup
Millions that, nigga I'm a walking vegetable
These niggas be biting and I'm getting fed up
Got your bitch at my condo with both of her legs up
These niggas be talking behind computers with a gun emoji
Now he think he a shooter
Eating Benihana, take a trip to Punta Cana
Fuck it, I might land in Bermuda
Thirty thirty, I got thirty rounds
The shotty make a nigga lose pounds
Harriet Tubman, money underground
You niggas is sick and we got the crown
Diamonds and pearls for my girl
It's a man's world, I feel like James Brown
Smoking power at the Trump tower
Nigga gassing, laughing, watching Richard Pryor
Fuck a job I don't get paid by the hour
Can't be from the block, I heard you a coward
When you got money it come with the power
I am the supplier, grip money like pliers
Stay with my Glock 40 its extended
Can't wait to pull it, trigger finger itching
Fork in the pot, lets go fishing
My momma always told me don't be trusting bitches
Hit em with it, hit em with it, hit em with it
Look at these diamonds like Sonny Liston
Migos fighting in the crowd
Looking like Ron Artest verses the Pistons

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Quavo!
Free my nigga Bobby Bitch
Hoes in the lobby bitch
At the age of 17, I hit my first lick
Twelve coming hit the fence you better jump the ditch
You don't wanna get caught with the dirty stick
Told that bitch to suck my dick, I don't want no kiss
When I got my first M, I bust down my wrist
When I got my first sem, I emptied the clip
Bad bitch fuck with a bad boy call her Lil Kim
Hakeem Olajuwon, above the rim
When I go to DC (Pow) I thought it was him
Then I land in Bahamas, order up some shrimp
The plug wanna meet up in Bahamas, told him make it quick
The money keep calling, tell it come in
Free Shmigo Gang, Bobby and Free Rowdy

[Outro: Rowdy Rebel]
Ah ah ah ho, Its ya boy Rowdy man

I’m gon’ bust my tool for ya
You don’t know what I do for ya
I'm gon' keep my cool for ya

[Verse 1 – Bobby Shmurda]
Cool kid, girl I might bust a juice in your eye
Tell her go and get a room key, girl Imma get a room for us
Hit me, she told me bout my groupies
Girl that’s just groupie love
Then I told her bout my two seat
And who I had in my two seater
I was rolling like I'm Drake from DeGrassi, I think I’m fancy
I won’t let em feel this cash me, I let em pass me
A nigga all about that cash see but if you ask me
I like em classy but love em nasty
She gave me head up in my backseat, that’s where my gat be
I leave a million in the alley to fly to Paris
But then she call me like a taxi so she can text me
I told that bitch go get my batteries and rub my Cali

[Hook]

[Verse 2 – Rowdy Rebel]
Late nights, great sex
She came first, I came next
Fucking up this telly
Watch the walls in this room sweat
Took a train, I called a jet
Tellin' niggas come correct, Abilly’s home so cut the check
Put a foot on nigga’s neck before a nigga disrespect I disconnect a nigga’s neck
Took a trip out west just to help me with the stress
Girl excuse me for my foolish thought cause I’m just getting used to you
Before we grab this bite, grab a room for ya
I swear to keep it true to ya
Because true was all she knew before she met me, now it’s two of us
I got her riding in the newest stuff
I bought the Bentley coupe, baby girl says she wants the Beamer truck
Fill her tank up, I fill her bank up
Kiss her, make up, we always break up
Girl look what this world do to us
Let’s go and get lost baby, I got a room for us

[Hook][Verse 1: Game]
I got a black mac and a six pack
I don't work out, I don't chit chat
My bitch bad, I get racks
That Rolls Royce, come gift-wrapped
Them birds still come shrink-wrapped
I'm not strapped, don't think that
I'm low key with that click clack
That rat a tat tat tat tat
Throw the burner and I'm runnin' home
Niggas stop being loyal when the money gone
Still walk in this bitch, I'm a hundred strong
One chain on my neck, feel like I got a hundred on
Look at my flow on this bitch
Platinum and gold on my wrist
Money, the accountant be countin' it
That's why I'm throwin' this shit
I'm in BK with that SK
Same clothes since yesterday
With that Biggie Smalls on replay
And I ain’t wearing no vest today
I do the Shmoney dance with this mac
You better do it too or get Shmurda’d
I be grilling that beef, I ain’t talkin’ no burgers
I finna be walkin’ like I’m a New Yorker
I let off the K and then I hop in the Uber
It’s never a question that I am the shooter
I empty the clip and lay you in a pool of
Blood, see how he got hit with the Ruger?
Blood, bandana that’s how we be movin’
Blood, swooping from Compton to Brooklyn
And this ain’t the Barclays but niggas be shootin’

[Hook: Bobby Shmurda] (x2)
Running niggas down back and forth
I’m like pass the torch, blast it off
Niggas making bets so who gonna blast him off?
First to score
We gon’ hit 'em hard, we gon’ hit 'em all
First to score
We gon’ hit 'em all, we gon’ hit 'em hard

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Running cocaina back and forth, copped the bag of salt
E-S to the G-N, I’m the boss dropped the package off
Coming for the murder, masks is off
Bitch you took a loss
Fuck the D.E.A. we shook ‘em off
Bitch we shook ‘em off
Shook and twist the jars
And dope on my momma's stove top
By the time she came back from church boy
I bet you I had an O stocked
In the middle of the muhfuckin' day
No more yayo, boy I done sold out
Nigga pull up in a mothafuckin’ foreign
On forgies that’ll bring them hoes out
Like yeah nigga, niggas keep beggin’
I pull out a pump in this bitch like I’m blizzard
Yeah, empty your pockets, we robbin’
These bitches got all of us trippin’
Nigga, it’s better to ask for forgiveness than ask for permission
You catchin’ the hollow, I’m catchin’ you slippin'
I did it alone, only God as my witness
My nigga got off cause we tied up the witness
And made sure the nigga couldn't show up in court
You know the business, them niggas find out that you snitchin'
Them niggas gon' be at your throat
Everyday Halloween niggas will go trick or treatin'
With two twenty-three at your door
Flippin' a check off this rappin'
Go back to the trap and put that in the weed and the blow like

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 3: Skeme]
I just caught a body like a week ago
These hatin' niggas want attention, I don't see 'em though
You talk that gangsta shit, but I just can't believe it bro
We pull up with them shots, knockin' out that European BOOM!
S to the K to the E-M-E
Callin' the EMT after I empted this clip
I sold my dope right on CMT
I'm at the ING, know I'm as weird as it gets
Chuck Taylor told me it's fuck haters
So I say fuck 'em and bury these niggas in pits
Rolley on wrist, no tock or no tick
Your girl on my dick, man come get your bitch
Niggas think this a rap now
I might back down and come try your luck
Riders with me be wired up
They ridin' with me till the tires bust
Haters talkin' but they better cool it
Before that nigga Crooked get fired up
Lay you out like my Balmains
You gotta play 'em straight, he get ironed up
Drinkin' lean till I'm high enough
I don't give a fuck about nan nigga
I ain't squashin' shit, I won't call it off
I just handle mine like a man nigga
I'm on frontline with these bands nigga
Need a chair, I can't stand niggas
We do walk-by's and hop outs
Got slidin' doors on that van nigga

[Zwrotka 1]
Było rudy karzeł Koldi, niedługo będzie cold killa
Już robię w miastach pierdolnik; jak koldzilla
Młody Hot Wigga, to tylko chwila
Żebym wieczorem mógł grać w bilard, teraz
Chyba styka, to pauza żeby od słabych utrzymać dystans
Masa skilli a słychać gdzie łączą zwrotki
I to niesmaczne jakbym popijał gorzką szprotki
Mogę zadzwonić do nich, wiedzą jak to się kończy
Odbierasz telefon, to jakbyś sobie odbierał życie
Bo zostanie Ci tyle ile był Diox na OLIS'ie
I ziom znakomicie na prawdę czuje z tym się
Że każdy mój wróg kiedyś umoczy dupę w Styksie
Nie jednego mam, stąd ta chwila perwersu
Wszystko będzie na miejscu gdy zostaną chuje w piździe
Ja se robię na zajawie ten shit
I wpada regularnie ten kwit
I rośnie regularnie fejm mi
A kto to Bonez, gdzie jest Planet ANM dziś
Koldi na track'u jak na szlaku do pieniądza
Który Tobie nie wpadnie jak cipo naplet do Grudziądza
Cipo naplet to chujoza
Wpadnij teraz, dziesięć sekund będziesz robił ćwoku homerun
Kocham tę kulturę asfuck i se ją ruchnę na hajs
Moja lista płac rośnie, choć trochę za wolno
Więc chyba pora by mocniej to popchnąć
Kiedy widzę na necie na mnie hejt wiem
Że znowu chce ktoś czegoś, nie wie jak to mieć bang bang
Kumam, że ich to boli kurwa przecież to Koldi
Buja nieźle a oni kutas w ręce i oh wee; przed monitorem
Pewnie niejeden pod instagram mojej młodej
A ja ciągle wiem, że mogę więc się wożę
Ty pisz kom gdzie ja se skoszę te pieniądze

[Outro]
Ale żem wypadł
Hot Nigga, Hot Ginga, Hot Wigga[Produced by Jahlil Beats]

[Intro]
Ya'll tryna' make a next motherfuckin' scene up in here, huh?
It's like Shmurda she wrote
How much shmoneys that? Ah ah ahh, ah, ah, ahh
Ah, ahh

[Verse]
In Truey, I'm some hot nigga
Like I talk to Shyste when I shot niggas
Like you seen him twirl then he drop, nigga
And we keep 'em nine millis on my block, nigga
And Monte keep it on him, he done dropped niggas
And Trigger he be wildin', he some hot nigga
Tones known to get busy with 'em Glocks, nigga
Try to run down and you can catch a shot, nigga
Runnin' through these checks 'til I pass out
And shorty give me neck 'til I pass out
I swear to God, all I do is cash out
And if you ain't a ho, get up out my trap house
I been sellin' crack since like the fifth grade
Really never made no difference what the shit made
Jaja taught me flip 'em packs and how to maintain
Get that money back and spend it on the same thing
Shawty like the way that I ball out
I be gettin' money 'til I fall out
You talkin' cash, dog, I goes all out
Shorty love the way that I floss out
Free Greezy though, let all of my dogs out
Mama said no pussy cats inside my doghouse
That's what got my daddy locked up in the dog pound
Free Phantom though, let all of my dogs out
We gon' pull up in that hooptie, like we cops on 'em
With M16's, we gon' put some shots on 'em
I send a lil thot to send the drop on 'em
She gon' call me up and I'm a sick the hots on 'em
Grimey savage, that's what we are
Grimey shooters dressed in G-Star
GS9, I go so hard
But GS for my gun squad
And bitch if it's a problem we gon' gun brawl
Shots poppin' out the AR
I'm with Trigger, I'm with Rasha, I'm with A-Rod
Broad daylight and we gon' let 'em things bark
Tell 'em niggas free Meeshie, ho
Some way, free Breezy, ho
And tell my niggas, Shmurda teamin', ho
Mitch caught a body about a week ago
Fuck with us and then we tweakin', ho
Run up on that nigga, get to squeezin', ho
Everybody catching bullet holes
Niggas got me on my bully, yo
I'm a run up, put that gun on 'em
I'm a run up, go dumb on 'em
Niggas got me on that young shit
Got me on that go dumb shit

[Outro]
Got me on that go dumb shit, man
Trap mode in this motherfucker, hotter than a bitch
Ayo, pour up, I need some more drank[Verse 1: French Montana]
Montana, I'm a block nigga
Heard they shot me, and I shot niggas
Young Hov, boss of the Roc, nigga
Three bricks for a verse, that's a swap, nigga
Shout my nigga Meek, he on lock, nigga
Shout my nigga Max, he in a box, nigga
Pull up La Marina in a yacht, nigga
Skate off like a pirate with your thot, nigga
Ya heard, she's a freaky ho
Bitch ain't loyal, she fucked Breezy, ho
Believe me, you can ask Weezy, ho
I heard she fucked Puff like a week ago
But I still want the pussy, though
I'ma Shmurda dance on the pussy, ho
That bitch ass full of bullet holes
Still paid couple grands for that pussy, ho
I'ma Shmurda dance on the pussy, ho
I'ma Shmurda dance on the pussy, ho
I'ma Shmurda dance on the pussy, ho
I'ma Shmurda dance on the pussy, ho

[Verse 2: Bobby Shmurda]
I'm Chewy, I'm some hot nigga
Like I talk to Shyste when I shot niggas
Like you seen him twirl then he drop, nigga
And we keep them 9 millis on my block, nigga
And Monte keep it on him, he done dropped niggas
And Trigger he be wilding, he some hot nigga
Tones known to get busy with them Glocks, nigga
Try to run down and you can catch a shot, nigga
Running through these checks 'til I pass out
And shorty give me neck 'til I pass out
I swear to God, all I do is cash out
And if you ain't a ho, get up out my trap house
I been selling crack since like the 5th grade
Really never made no difference what the shit made
Jaja taught me flip them packs and how to maintain

Shorty like the way that I ball out
I be getting money 'til fall out
You talking cash, dog, I goes all out
Shorty love the way that I floss out

[Verse 3: Ace Hood]
Shoutin' out to Philly, free my nigga, tho
Soon as my nigga Fat Boy hit the turf, I got his envelope
Tell'em kiss ya ass, they can do that under mistletoe
Think its sweet then go aimin' straight at your cantaloupe
Yeah you know I'm trained to blow, I got that halitosis flow
Jumpin' out the Lambo in sandals, I got that antidote
Hammer pokin' out of my pocket, it's like a camel toe
Gassin' all these rappers, ya'll need to work at a Texaco
I ain't got no medals, I ain't got no medals
Pussy nigga sleepin, hit him up in his pajamas
I hit him up in his pajamas
I'm just tryna kick it, tell them bitches David Beckham
Ok, I'm bluffin', never love'm, got a question, is we fuckin'?
She addicted, David Ruffin, load the clip and watch it buffle
I'm a hot nigga, someone tell that to the tan bed
If the beat was human, I would tell him he a dead man
Ain't no hope in wishin', Phantom Ghost through the Bentley
If he with the scissors, can't afford it with your bitchin'

[Verse 4: Juicy J]
Juicy J a monster Talyor Gang sponsor
With your girlfriend about to fuck her in her tonsils
Yellow momma wetter than a lake in her jeans
And she be wide awake and I still sell that bitch her dream
No Hollywood divorce you can't hit me for half
No prenup just a nut I just want to smash
Baby I just wanna hit it and get rid of your ass
I'm not giving it to my feelings I'm too busy getting cash
Double cup of lean-monade thats that Justin Bieber
And these shoes that I got on they cost more than a KIA
Every time I sign in cursive thats to add another zero
Fuck niggas know I keep that metal on me like Magneto
I hear this money talking my money machine stunna
All these rocks up on my watch I think my jeweler do construction
That bullshit you selling my nigga we ain't buying
We don't do that chatta bitch we strictly lifting that iron
Banana clip, longer than a video on vine
All these fucking guns like we saving Private Ryan
Your nigga pulled up on bikes
Little nigga about to earn his stripes
It might cost him his freedom but it gon' cost you your life

[Verse 5: Ace Hood]
Yeah, it's true, I am a beat killer
You looking at the hottest of the hot niggas
Summer time, but my Rollie still in late December
Niggas actin like some bitches, need to change genders
Know it's only poppin', tell me why they wake the goblin up
Silence on the gun so we don't have to wake your daughter up
Way before the Tampa Bay, bitch I been chasin' everyone
Tell me why they wanna throw a pebble at an armored truck
Lookin' at a 101, pussy, you ain't one of us
Make me get retarded like I'm ridin' on a short bus
Flexin' on these niggas, oh I thought this was a warm up?
Tell'em shoot it up then double back, I call it karma
People pay attention, push a button for ignition
Dopest in the business, think I need some intervention
Soon as go to wackin', Imma send him in detention
Clips like weaves, know they comin' with extensions
Always on the hustle, bitches know I keep a couple
Sleep without a blanket, never know who under covers
Fuck her, never love her, wear a rubber, blow it back, yo
I'm super dope, I'm a walking trap house

[Verse 6: Bobby Shmurda]
Free Greezy though, let all of my dogs out
Momma said no pussy cats inside my dog house
That's what got my daddy locked up in the dog pound
Free Phantom though, let all of my dogs out
We gon' pull up in that hooptie like we cops on 'em
With the 16's, we gon' put some shots on him
I send a little thot to send the drop on him
She gon' call me up and I'm a sick the hots on him
Grimey savage, that's what we are
Grimey shooters dressed in G-Star
GS9, I go so hard
But GS for my gun squad
And bitch if it's a problem we gon' gun brawl
Shots popping out The AR
I'm with Trigger, I'm with Rasha, I'm with A-Raw
Broad daylight and we gon' let them things bark
Tell them niggas free Meeshie, ho
Subwave, free Greezy, ho
And tell my niggas, Shmurda teaming, ho
Mitch caught a body 'bout a week ago
Fuck with us and then we tweaking, ho
Run up on that nigga, get to squeezing, ho

Shmurda, what up, son?
Brooklyn, what up, son? Huh?

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Yo, I hit my shmoney dance when I caught the lick
I hit my shmoney dance when I caught ya chick
I Bobby Shmurdered that when she came 'round
Threw the hat up in the air, it never came down
And I just caught that body like a week ago
Real quick, click clack, get to freakin', ho
She want some hot nigga chillin' out in Mykonos
Or thot niggas all summer, every weekend, ho
I ain't no killer but don't push me, yo
I had 'em killers in yo' bushes, yo
Them trick niggas splurge on the pussy, yo
You give me one day, I'll Purge on that pussy, yo
You ain't seen these kicks since like the fifth grade
Back when Bo Jackson and Ken Griffey played
On my 90s flow, nigga, Young OG shit
On my GSC, Meet the Family shit

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Can't hold you forever, you gon' get a date
Tell 'em free my nigga Critter Mate
Hold ya head to all my niggas in the state
D-Block, GS9, nigga, get it straight
Got the semi and fully on me
Gloves, mask and a hoodie on me
Case we need to steal a V, I got the pully on me
I know you shocked, right? They got me on bully, homie
It's fake love cause they really hatin'
For my downfall, they really waitin'
Hundred yardies, a hundred Haitians
I'm a hot nigga by affiliation

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Look, fresh up out the county, I done did a lil bid
Let the popos run up on me, I won't tell them coppers shit
All this money in my pocket, you might think I sold a brick
I got four hoes and some Hen, some low pros on my Benz
And if I catch that nigga slippin', I'mma shut him down
Let my homies separate his body, call that Seven Pounds
Better cool out, I'm nice with the hands
You keep talking that shit, I'll knock you out
A nigga be pickin' you up off of the ground for thinkin' you 2Pac
And shawty give me neck till I pass out
And she just gettin' checks cause her ass out
Makin' money, gotta be the fast route
Bitch, if you ain't fuckin', better get yo' ass out

[Verse 4: Rowdy Rebel]
Pow! Pow! That chopper make him Diddy Bop
Free Slice Billy, let my billy rock
And free A-billi, let A-billi out
When Flex drop a bomb on us, watch the city rock
Made Diddy shmoney dance right on Biggie block
Make him bring a hundred bands and the city out
When Fresh pull up in that brand new yop
Watch me slide off wit' ya thot cause I'm worth about a milli now
Niggas think cause we dancin' 'round, niggas won't get shot
That's Bobby Shmurda, not Bobby Brown, known to pop up on the block
These pussy niggas better calm it down, get the same drop from that thot
And these fuck niggas don't come around cause they know they gon' get shot

[Verse 5: Busta Rhymes]
Fuck around and get ya shit popped
Like hanging out too long on 91st and Winthrop
See, you the type to probably get got
See, this where all the fuckery nigga shit stop
Shawty climb this money mountain to the tip-top (get it)
Throw a hundred fifty on my wrist (watch)
Stayed with the heat, they call me Chris Bosh
Angry cause niggas see me leavin' the bitch block
Shout my nigga Web, shout my nigga Luger
Free my nigga Smiles, free my nigga Scooter
I suggest you probably pray to Buddha
Conglomerate and GS9 niggas full of shooters

[Verse 6: Yo Gotti]
Let's talk about a hot nigga
My dogs'll sit and watch, nigga
Fuck the judge, we never cop, nigga
Who the first to bring that Lambo on the block, nigga?
Poppin' Aces in the studio wit' Bobby 'nem
Before all the labels started callin' him
Cause bitch, I understand him cause I'm one of them
So know you hatin' on me if you hatin' on them
Memphis shooters, that's who we are
Made a million out a glass jar
Cocaine, I got dope bars
My nigga Snootie just caught a gun charge
Fuck a law, we gon' ride strapped, bitch
We be bout that beef, fuck that rap shit
And free my nigga Meek, I'm on my Philly shit
And my New York bitch from Dyckman, she Dominican

[Verse 7: Bobby Shmurda]
Grimy savage, that's who we are
Grimy shooters dressed in G-Star
GS9, I go so hard
But GS for my Gun Squad
And bitch, if it's a problem, we gon' gun brawl
Shots poppin' out the AR

Broad daylight and we gon' let them thangs bark
Tell them niggas free Meeshie, ho

[Outro: Bobby Shmurda]
Got me on that go dumb shit, man
Trap mode in this muhfucka, hotter than a bitch
Ayo, pour up, I need some more drank[Hook: YT Triz]
How can I lose, when I came here with nothin'? [x4]
I am leaving here with somethin'
Always servin' somethin' [x2]
How can I lose, when I came here with nothin'? [x2]

[Verse 1: YT Triz]
What can I lose when I never had shit?
I was out hitting the licks
I was out flipping the nicks
Man that ain't shit. I want the bricks
Way up like Michael Vick, I just wanna go legit
Remember I told the bitch (I told her), but now Imma show you this (ha)
Young nigga sippin' Moet, I'm thinkin' I'll never forget
I drive with no license with grams
The dice in my hands, I'm rollin' that shit
I ride with 2Pac in my hand
And two Glocks in my hands, and I'm loadin' that shit
And I got a semi; I keep that bitch wit me
Her nickname is Biggie; that bitch shoot like 50
Bitch-- we the mob; I'm John Gotti
Moving that Whitney,  Bobby
I'm so fly that I wanna rob me
Pullin' them hoes out the lobby
I think that I came to be somethin'
Go straight to bank, like hunnid (ay)
Gimme them crispy new hunnids
I came in here fuckin' with nuthin'

[Hook: YT Triz]

[Verse 2: Bobby Shmurda]
How can I lose, when I came here with nothin'?
I'm cockin' my tool, and I'm leavin' with somethin'
Ain't scared to shoot, and we packin' them hunnids
Tell Monte to shoot then Monte start dumpin'
Boom Boom Boom
Then Monte start dumpin'
Boom Boom Boom
How can I leave my niggas? I love 'em
I make a move then my niggas- they comin'
I be stuntin', my niggas they be stuntin'
Ask 'em what?
My niggas say nothin' [x3]
A lot of these bitches, I don't really love 'em
Cause they didn't want me when I was nothin'
Now that I'm stuntin', they screamin' they want it
Now that I'm on, I'm screamin' now fuck 'em [x3]
I'm screamin' now fuck 'em [x3]
Ya bitch

[Hook: YT Triz & Bobby Shmurda]

[Verse 3: YT Triz]
How can I lose, when I'm winnin'?
Them losses was in the beginnin'
Ain't no way out once you winnin'
I got respect in my city
I feel like I'm taller than Shaq
I put my family on my back
I'm countin' them racks on them racks
I used to sack the sax
I can not hide all these facts
I can not hide all the pain with these tats
You can not lie when you look at the stats
You got the answers; you didn't have to ask
I'm finna go; I'm finna blow like its a O
I'm finna' smoke. Straight off the block
Reachin' my goals. Now that I'm hot, I'm lettin' you know
I use to stand at the store-- now I'm the man at the store!
Droppin' that flamin' at you (that flame!). Yeah muthafucka, it's poor
Got that bitch sayin', "You know"
She know where we finna go
Cause she fell in love with my thuggin
The same time that I fell in love with that money
How can I lose, when I came here with nuthin'? [x4]

[Hook: YT Triz][Intro]
I love my squad , i love my squad , i love my squad

[Verse 1: A-Billion]
Burner on my side but I'm finna to cut you open nigga
Ain't nobody with you in the water when you floating nigga

Fucking with some soldiers nigga and I thought I told you nigga

[Hook]
And I'm thinking I can do this Man (Hold up)

[Verse 2]
I only fuck with bad bitches bad bitches and you know it

Spin back around and give niggas another moment
A hunned rounds you pray it stop but it keeps on going

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Bobby Shmurda]
Hold up Roll up with my soldiers (with my soldiers)

Give him 9 every clip think he fuckin with this squad (squad)

[Hook x2][Verse 1: Bobby Shmurda]
Let me tell you I'm conceited, bitch, I don't need a bitch
They be begging me to breed a bitch, but I can't keep a bitch
You know me, right after I beat it bitch, Imma leave it, bitch
I ain't even with the screaming shit, Imma freeze a bitch
Then ask Monte where my sneakers went, with the Beamer whip
Shooting niggas front of Keisha crib, right where Keisha live
Homie, tell me if you need a shift, I'm at Rita crib
CC2's like every weekend, bitch, ain't no sleeping this
Let me tell you 'bout my reckless life
I was selling white, homies 'bout to cause some wreck tonight
Ain't no check tonight, police looking for us left to right
Ain't no rest tonight, we on the run until the check is right
You get the message, aight?

[Hook x2: Rowdy Rebel]
Now what you know about that kitchen life
When we was pitching white?
People saying that our vision right, but we ain't living right
I told Bobby keep that pistol tight the way we living life
Niggas turn into that jealous type when you start living life

[Verse 2: Rowdy Rebel]
I'm living life like a boss
Bitch, take a photo and get busy with a star
I'm living large so don't know the total to my car
But I just know that shit real fast when it start
Shit, watch me take off, I'm a fool, I'm a dog
I'm a nigga that make music for a job
I'll drop a bomb on your big body cars
Nigga, what you thought? Bitch, I'm Rowdy, I go hard
With 30 bands then I blow it on the squad
Give a little bit of Shmoney to my moms
Remember when that nigga used to jugg and rob
Now we living large

[Hook x2: Rowdy Rebel]
