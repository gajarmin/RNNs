[2Pac] They say

[Intro/Hook]
[B-Legit] Influenced by crime, addicted to grindin'
[C-Bo] Where I can pile up my chips
[Richie Rich] And niggas call me a timer
[2Pac] I been ballin' since my adolescent years steady climbin'
[E-40] Man, you motherfuckers don't know nuttin' about no timin'

[2Pac] That's right, that's right boy start that shit off

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I heard a rumour I died, murdered in cold blood dramatized
Pictures of me in my final stage you know Mama cried
But that was fiction, some coward got the story twisted
Like I no longer existed, mysteriously missin'
Although I'm worldwide, baby I ain't hard to find
Why I spend most of my time, my California grind
Watching for thievin' I'm cautious it's like I'm barely breathin'
Puttin a bullet in motherfuckers give me a reason
See me and hope I'm intoxicated or slightly faded
You tried to play me now homicide is my only payment
I'm addicted to currency in this life I lead
Why the fuck you cowards be runnin', too scared to fight a G
For the life of me, I cannot see
How motherfuckers picture livin' life after a night of fuckin' around with me
And if you don't like this rhyme
Then bring your big bad ass to California, cause we ain't hard to find

[Hook]

[Verse 2: C-Bo]
I got my locs on hard hat goin' to war
Breakin' them off on sight, stoppin' lives like red lights
Watch em pause as I pull my strap, out my drawers
And get to dumpin' on they ass, like the last outlaws
Rich, 2Pac and the Click, smokin' blunts, loadin' clips
With enough shit to raise your block in one dip
We bring on horror like Tales From the Crypt
And we ain't hard to find is the tales that we kick

[B-Legit]
I'm fully automatic full of static and shit
Movin' Dodge van fifty rounds in the clip
I'm ridin' shot gun with the tint in the back
I'm plan to have a motherfuckerin' mint in this rap
I'm from the V-A-L-L-E-J-O
Where sellin' narcotics is all I know
I got blow, speed, bleed, whatever yo' kind
And if you need a motherfucker I ain't hard to find

[D-Shot]
Some may call me Bootsy, but I call it timin'
That's while I keeps on grindin' (that's right)
To the point where a nigga can't stop
Too much feelin' this shit, that's why I'm quick to peel a bitch
Whether it's a nigga or a ho, a ho
Get in my way, then that ass gots to go
Cause a nigga steady plottin'
I serves hit for hit, and motherfuckers keep droppin'

[Hook]

[2Pac] C-Bo and D-Shot, E-40, Richie Rich
[E-40] Da Bay, beitch!

[Verse 3: E-40]
Down the steps
Abandoned broken down apartment complex
Heavy metal lipstick hairy can't be scary
Playboy, what the fuck is the proof without the trauma plate
Nigga, what the fuck you got a gun for, if ya gonna hesitate
Best shake and bake all those I-was-finst-to-ask niggas
Motherfuckers-didn't-think-I was-gon'-do-somethin'-ass niggas
Threaten your life, ain't like you love him
Bury your thoughts, take his head fuck him have at him

[Richie Rich]
Check this out
I grew up with that nigga
Threw up with that nigga
I hear he tryin' to ride
Double-edgin' for the other side
But now, my Glock be so judgemental
Back seat of a rental
Keep my name out your dental, nigga
If your gum bleeding and you needing
More than twenty stitches, you behaved like them bitches
Sideways to the race
Heavy in the game
Check the resident, it's all the same
Nigga, and we ain't hard to find

[2Pac] Hell nah we ain't hard to find
[C-Bo] The whole clickilation fool
[E-4]) Motherfuckers hard to find, right here bitch

[2Pac] Why them niggas acting like they can't find us? Like they can't see us and like we don't be at the same spots they be at? It's the same congregation. Young Pac is back, youknowhatImean?
[C-Bo] Nigga be lookin' all the way when he see you and shit
It's a celebration, Young Pac is back
[E-40] Motherfuckers better understand this shit
[2Pac] Ay D-Shot nigga can we get paid man?
Can we just go there and sock this shit up?
Hey, we smokin', and we ain't hard to find
Drinkin' and shit, fuckin' with some hurricane
[E-40] A motherfucker's gonna get his Marlboro's regardless playa
[2Pac] You supposed to
Sideways to the next light...[Intro: B-Legit]
Mobb shit bitch
I know you know
But check game doe

[Verse One: B-Legit & E-40]
I'm in the S-C 4-double-oh
Sitting real low, stick in the flo', oh
The ho want me to come swoop
Take her for a ride in my blue Lex Luthor (Lex Luth-ah)
But the bitch ain't got no gas fetti (gas fetti)
So I burnt her like Fast Freddy (Fast Freddy)
Hit me on the first when your mail has come
And maybe we can go to the mall or somethin (to the mall or somethin)
(Heavy ass shit for the mob -- for the mob
When I make a zillion I resign -- I resign
I'm realer than a hundred dollar bill with the line across
When Christmas come around ask Santa Claus
Santa do you know E-40?
Bet you that nigga say "That's my homey!"
We used to perv grind curb trip to my grandma
Kahlua, milk and brandy almost every day)
Cognac is cool, but I'm on gin (on gin)
Santa bought me, a new Mac-10 (yeah)
(Yeah, Click shit makes a motherfucker's night
Niggas listen to it cuz it's tight
Crooked twisted unlisted on the highways
We riding sideaways, beotch!)

[Hook: Mac Shon]
I'm riding sideways, this way thatta way
("Back up the Coupe and roll sideways")
I'm riding sideways, this way thatta way
("Made a left at the corner cuz it was hoes")
I'm riding sideways, this way thatta way
("I'm looking for a big seat")
I'm riding sideawats, this way thatta way
("Hoes see this type of shit and go reala...")

[Verse 2: B-Legit & E-40]
I'm riding city to city (city to city), me and Leviti
So get your toilet paper cuz it's gon' get shitty (gon' get shitty)
I hit the highway goin East (East)
Twenty-two ounces of yeast (yeast...)
I'm playin this game cuz a nigga my age be
I met her last night and today she paged me
Wanna know if B-Legit can kick it tonight (what else)
Only sixteen, way too tight
But age ain't nothin but a number -- number
Baby got her hair done by Shanda -- Shanda
Nine nine ten, eleven and up
If you bleed, you get fucked -- fucked
No not me, not fo'-oh -- not fo'-oh

Every fuckin day is a holiday, celebration
When the bitch is actin crabby that means she's on her menestration

Talkin more shit than colitis
A str-uh, strizuck out in my Cutlass Supreme on a Friday
(which way we ridin) Riding sideaways... beotch!

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: E-40 & B-Legit]
See I'mma hogg nigga, Beverly Hillbilly
Neckbone, oxtails, pork'n'beans and chili
Just like my nigga Celly, we likes to kick it silly
Regurgitate and kick a bootch smooth up out the telly
Cause they out there bad ain't satisfied
Hoes just wanna be pacified
But I can't do no justice cuz the justice ain't to be did
BEOTCH! You usin too much red
Now I've been known to break niggas off (off)
Hard top or soft, line em up chalk em up as a loss
See me in the parking lot doing my thang (yeah)
Love to see my old school dance in the rain (kick it)
The po-po's came then they closed up shop (kick it)
Smashed through the Hood and we made that hot (yah)
See the shit don't stop (stop) motherfuckers pop (pop)
Seven-deuce drop (drop) Coney air shocks (mmhmm)
Riding through the shit like Racer X
And if a motherfucker flex break back and necks (back and necks)
Running red lights and the right-of-ways
(How we gonna get it doe?) We get it sideaways, beitch!!

[Hook:]Two times two equals four doors on old school Chevy ridin' on Vogues
Windows up track getting stuck
Ice cold rosy in my pimp style cup
Lil Bruce is extra manish
I'll punch it sideways and grandma can't stand it
Smoke some up at the Springs Road stop sign
And them I spin em' by the church about two more times
Hoes hella scared me and Mac Shawn laughing
That's when the six seven coupe starts blasting
It was burn orange with the black canvas top
I go for my Glock I didn't have to pop
Cause it was the kay one getting dumb with the [?]
Made chopper with the cooler for the real deal
Funk my donk put together by a gangster
Dola Mic done possessed this youngster
It's all good I'll pass the swisher
Then I'll slap my kit in low and make my old school dis ya'

Mobbin' in my old school
Smashing like a stripe fool
Ain't trippin' on the police
Cause you know I'm down for the high speeds

I'm a nappy headed singer with the smoker's choke
Cause I'm addicted to the Louie smoke
From the Miller vue' riding wide wheels
Now do you wanna smob with me
The kush is in season
Got your cousin sleezin
Only seventeen riding zeans
I'm funked out so don't turn my system down
I blow by the high with so much pound
Mom had a fit cause I quit last year
If you don't go to school you can't stay here
She's sidin' and I'm glidin'
And all the teenies at the school wanna ride in
The love boat and spoke my coat
I pull to the curb and say what's up though
Only seventeen but looked way older
Hopped in my mob like she's seen the rose
She say she cut third and got no time
And five plus five equals a dime
A straight super bad with a barbed wire cut
And now her nosy mom wants to know what's up

Mobbin' in my old school
Smashing like a stripe fool
Ain't trippin' on the police
Cause you know I'm down for the high speeds

Triple gold zeans with the straight laced wire
Colossus in the back trying to start a fire
Bumpin' left side plush to kill
Funk my mob through the Millers-ville
Six 15's with the Zapco hook
I bought my colossus from nanny the crook
My cousin Darius slapped the horns under the back
The Alpine pull out makes it complete
Gold with the silver base and the hella coked interior
Coke white top with the peanut butter interior
Pin stripes and motors yeah you know
Every other week I got to buy new Vogues
I love to burn rubber and punch my gas
I got a [?] mirror and photo glass
So if you see me spinning in the intersection
Mob your old school in the left direction
And give up the view for Little Bruce
And what's up to my cousins in the seven duce
Cutlasses bumpin' this
To the girlies at the bus stop get with this
It's lunch time and I'm on grind
And baby next to me is hecks of fine

Mobbin' in my old school
Smashing like a stripe fool
Ain't trippin' on the police
Cause you know I'm down for the high speeds[Hook]
Same nigga... Same nigga… (x2)
My nigga I done came from nothing (from nothing nigga)
But now a nigga got everything (everything nigga)
That's why you see me every time I'm stuntin (I'm stuntin nigga)
Still the same nigga I'mma never change (I'll never change)
I been the same since '88 (I'll never change)
Same nigga since '88 (I'll never change)
I been the same since '88 (I'll never change)
Same nigga since '88 (I'll never change)

[E-40]
Only thing changed about me is my change, and that can flunctuate from time to time
Especially when you investing in yourself, you can hit & miss when you flippin a coin & rollin da dice
Gambling witcha life instead of working for da white--- man!
Can't be out there stuntin clumsy, be a businessman, use other people money
I'm a street nigga that just so happen to rap hella good
When I was flea-flickin, I'll lower the price and give you a joog
I'm good in my hood, they love me, respect me outside of rappin
I'm a good dude, I ain't funny actin
I got a purple heart in ballin, I'm a general
I got a black belt in hustling, not taekwondo
I see my little homie in the traffic with his convertible off
What you smoking my n***a? "Strawberry cough"
He used to sell soft, but now its software
He official, a boss, dreads in his hair

[Hook]

[Too $hort]
In '88 I was ridin with my top down, on the bay bridge getting my dick sucked nigga
No doubt Short Dog would get her
Ain't nothing change still bet not let her come around me
It's too much game, what I'd do to her uh make you insane
I take her somewhere while I do my thang, she'll never be the same mayne, never be the same
And I'm still getting money, still makin hits
Still ridin clean, still sayin "bitch"
Where the haters at? Say something
Never like me since day one
You can listen to the oldies if you want to (if you want to)
I spit game that's all I do
I bet yo favorite rapper ain't around no mo
Like Too Short & E Four-Oh.. bitch

[Hook]

[B-Legit]

Used to get them by the lake... duct tape
Turn a 4 into a 8 kept a nigga straight


[Hook][Celly Cel]
I roll 360 degrees and slidin' to the function
Shirley-locks in my hair, yelling 'Bump Something'
Menage-a-trois, need about three with me in this spot
Mixing up my Drizze while they stizz up on that row, but
See, I'm a ridah, when I flash it ain't nowhere to hide ya
I'm right besides ya 'bout to let these thangs all up inside ya
There ain't no sense tryin' to knock a playa for the way he lounge
Even the haters in your town sing it's going down

[Rappin' 4-Tay]
Up in the spot, fool got popped, killed a cop, jumped in a drop
That was the life he lived but now it's honded
Imagine your dome posted on America's Most Wanted
They flowned it and locked him up for conniving
Whether the strong surviving
Or getting pimped by the system
I still be 4 1 5 ing it down to the V
With that fool Celly C E L L
Shakin' it, breakin' it, movin' it with this clientele
With this underground, it's going down
Ha ha

1- [Celly Cel] (Kerry)
Ride with your folks (It's going down)
Sideways in a cloud of smoke (It's going down)
Bumping 'til your amps blow (It's going down)
'Cuz you know it's going down for sure

Ride with your folks (It's going down)

Bumping 'til your amps blow (It's going down)

[E-40]
Get up, uh, I'd like to, uh, dig you when I dug

Grew up on that: who put dem hickeys on your neck?
Ugh, how many babies did you make off that Keith Sweat?
Don't even trip it's all labexibiali fitty
Hit the clubs and act bad, get them biatches ready
Up on release, Forty youze a cold piece
You hardly war makin', drinkin', shootin' me out, it's soft

[B-Legit]
It's off the fenzo, I ride the Benzo, Bill Clinton, presidential
Out the window, never been, though
Type that get the party loud trunkin'
So they can hear me, I keep 'em leery
With twamps on the S Series
And Cruise Control, gonna take 'em where them hoochies roll
If for some dough, them hoochies down to sell they soul
So, when you see me double-parked, flashing hazard lights
You get it right, cuz, man, it's going down tonight

Repeat 1

[Mack 10]
West Side! You know who he be Hoo Banging

And connect gangin' and ya know that's how it go
Although it ain't gonna be easy but believe me, dog
It's gonna be off the heezy fo' sheezy
And if it ain't, huh, I laugh it off like a joke
And I grab my AK cuz I spray up anybody for my folks in the Bay
On the real, homeboy, I'm a killer
I leave your shirt soakin', no jokin'
So if it's going down tonight
I be on the first thing smokin', so holler at me

[Celly Cel]
It's going down so majorly my pager battery
Stay on low cells while I'm trying to get some mo' mail
Dodgin' hot ones, makin' liquor store runs
Creepin' through the city streets, pervin' and I'm on one
Can't get wrapped up in that "He said she said"
What was said already did, runnin' your mouth will get you filled with lead
So I stay real, soakin' that game outta the hills
Ridin' with that Mazda sound
Now you know it's going down

Repeat 1 to fade{*money counting machine runs, stops, then beeps*}

Me myself and I the only one that I can trust
Sleep with one eye open, finger on my pistol clutch
I got my hand in everything, I'm real instrumental
I'm as real as they come, ain't got no bitch per-tential
When I was comin up, there's certain things we don't allow
Like long fingernails, and men archin they eyebrow
Here's another thing I don't condone and don't approve
How all of a sudden snitchin became cool? (I don't know)
I'm gamed up, I be chewin on this mack granite
O.G. J.B. stomp down, lace the nigga, 'sposed to never panic
I bump the baddest broad in the whole facilitation
All by way of mouthpiece, just by mind manipulation

Persuade a broad to put on the dress, and break her for her purse

Take the wrong turn and these youngsters out here'll kill ya
The law ain't concerned, they love us hustlers and dealers
They wanna tear our houses down so they can build some Ikeas
Oooooh - wow! Just tryin to get my point across
Where I'm from it's pandemonium and chaos
Where I'm from the lights is off, we use matches
Where I'm from we do it barefaced instead of ski-masks
Caw-caw-caw-caw, no more talkin on them cells

They got us sleepin in the gym instead of our own cells

A slave to the hood, have no money in my pants
Rollin wit some heat to make a mutha fucka dance

Copy bootin-legger
Or however, whatever
Long as the weathers clever

Juss as sneaky as I wanna be, trifle do
Fuck goin by the books and stickin to them rules

[Verse 7: B-Legit]
Ten is the limit on the card I'm holdin
Citibank Visa, but the card is stolen
Retail price, just pay me half
But you gotta come right with the cash

[Hook: 2x]

[Verse 8: E-40]
I done took a few heads fo the skriller Bay
Hope it don't come back an haunt me
Got funk wit like seven different crews
Cuz I done jacked, kidnapped, an did dirt to them fools
Watch my back
Been lookin over my shoulder blades
Hella sneaky cuz I heard them niggas got grenades
I'm from the Bay so regardless what I'm caught up in, this tangle
Can't get up out the Dodge, wit this federal beeper on my ankle

[Verse 9: B-Legit]
Mutha fuckaz don't ride fair no mo
Get snatched out the 9-6, 5 point 0
Took to the hills to get stapled man
While a nigga ride off in a Stang

[Verse 10 : Celly Cel]
Man I need some ends
But to get the ends I gotta sin
Fuck it, let me page a nigga, lie bout what I'm a spend
Bring me a pound, I got it sold on this side of town
You got that yey, you weigh, I pay, fool that's how it's goin down
Bring it in zippers, an I'm a bring the body ripper
The big dipper, wit an extra thirty round clipper
He brought it back, weighed out to the fullest
Little did he know I had his name engraved on my bullet
Dumpin like a fool, served, nigga pumpin gas
Had that heat fo his ass, took his yey an all his cash
I made him feel a, money hungry blood spilla
Straight killa, I did it fo the skrilla

[Hook: 2x][2Pac] They say

[Intro/Hook]
[B-Legit] Influenced by crime, addicted to grindin'
[C-Bo] Where I can pile up my chips
[Richie Rich] And niggas call me a timer
[2Pac] I been ballin' since my adolescent years steady climbin'
[E-40] Man, you motherfuckers don't know nuttin' about no timin'

[2Pac] That's right, that's right boy start that shit off

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I heard a rumour I died, murdered in cold blood dramatized
Pictures of me in my final stage you know Mama cried
But that was fiction, some coward got the story twisted
Like I no longer existed, mysteriously missin'
Although I'm worldwide, baby I ain't hard to find
Why I spend most of my time, my California grind
Watching for thievin' I'm cautious it's like I'm barely breathin'
Puttin a bullet in motherfuckers give me a reason
See me and hope I'm intoxicated or slightly faded
You tried to play me now homicide is my only payment
I'm addicted to currency in this life I lead
Why the fuck you cowards be runnin', too scared to fight a G
For the life of me, I cannot see
How motherfuckers picture livin' life after a night of fuckin' around with me
And if you don't like this rhyme
Then bring your big bad ass to California, cause we ain't hard to find

[Hook]

[Verse 2: C-Bo]
I got my locs on hard hat goin' to war
Breakin' them off on sight, stoppin' lives like red lights
Watch em pause as I pull my strap, out my drawers
And get to dumpin' on they ass, like the last outlaws
Rich, 2Pac and the Click, smokin' blunts, loadin' clips
With enough shit to raise your block in one dip
We bring on horror like Tales From the Crypt
And we ain't hard to find is the tales that we kick

[B-Legit]
I'm fully automatic full of static and shit
Movin' Dodge van fifty rounds in the clip
I'm ridin' shot gun with the tint in the back
I'm plan to have a motherfuckerin' mint in this rap
I'm from the V-A-L-L-E-J-O
Where sellin' narcotics is all I know
I got blow, speed, bleed, whatever yo' kind
And if you need a motherfucker I ain't hard to find

[D-Shot]
Some may call me Bootsy, but I call it timin'
That's while I keeps on grindin' (that's right)
To the point where a nigga can't stop
Too much feelin' this shit, that's why I'm quick to peel a bitch
Whether it's a nigga or a ho, a ho
Get in my way, then that ass gots to go
Cause a nigga steady plottin'
I serves hit for hit, and motherfuckers keep droppin'

[Hook]

[2Pac] C-Bo and D-Shot, E-40, Richie Rich
[E-40] Da Bay, beitch!

[Verse 3: E-40]
Down the steps
Abandoned broken down apartment complex
Heavy metal lipstick hairy can't be scary
Playboy, what the fuck is the proof without the trauma plate
Nigga, what the fuck you got a gun for, if ya gonna hesitate
Best shake and bake all those I-was-finst-to-ask niggas
Motherfuckers-didn't-think-I was-gon'-do-somethin'-ass niggas
Threaten your life, ain't like you love him
Bury your thoughts, take his head fuck him have at him

[Richie Rich]
Check this out
I grew up with that nigga
Threw up with that nigga
I hear he tryin' to ride
Double-edgin' for the other side
But now, my Glock be so judgemental
Back seat of a rental
Keep my name out your dental, nigga
If your gum bleeding and you needing
More than twenty stitches, you behaved like them bitches
Sideways to the race
Heavy in the game
Check the resident, it's all the same
Nigga, and we ain't hard to find

[2Pac] Hell nah we ain't hard to find
[C-Bo] The whole clickilation fool
[E-4]) Motherfuckers hard to find, right here bitch

[2Pac] Why them niggas acting like they can't find us? Like they can't see us and like we don't be at the same spots they be at? It's the same congregation. Young Pac is back, youknowhatImean?
[C-Bo] Nigga be lookin' all the way when he see you and shit
It's a celebration, Young Pac is back
[E-40] Motherfuckers better understand this shit
[2Pac] Ay D-Shot nigga can we get paid man?
Can we just go there and sock this shit up?
Hey, we smokin', and we ain't hard to find
Drinkin' and shit, fuckin' with some hurricane
[E-40] A motherfucker's gonna get his Marlboro's regardless playa

My neck and wrist be shinin in the sun
All big faces, ain’t none of these ones
Out here getting it in the California slums
Because ballin' is fun

[Verse 2: E-40]
Protect yourself at all times, cause niggas be on Belucci and snort lines
Real life, not a movie, hard times
Gotta' be aware, pay attention to your warning signs
That’s why I life live to the end, cause you never know when it’s gon' end
Er'yday my birthday, don’t worry out what I spend
Everything this hustler got, this hustler earned it
Monster, but my first name ain’t Herman
Came in the game with nothin', got out the game with somethin'
Was traffic out there rushin', in the ghetto out there hustlin'
Stacking my chips, eating my bread, strapped with the lead
They want me dead
Knocking a ho, getting some head, on a Sealy mattress bed
Took a left over from my bundle after I copped and bought a drop
Ballin' is fun, I bought it with 1’s, drove it up off of the lot
Went in and got me some slap, and wrapped in matte black
Tinted window front and back, Pontiac and the 20 sack

[Hook] x2
My neck and wrist be shinin' in the sun
All big faces, ain’t none of these ones
Out here getting it in the California slums
Because ballin' is fun

[Verse 2: Too Short]
Your life is hard, times are tough, looking for money, you can’t find enough
You try rapping, but nobody signed you up
Got some cocaine, try to grind and stuff
Went to jail, now your time is up
Can’t get it all together cause your mind is fucked
Mad at the world cause you ride the bus
Looking out the window, wanna' ride like us
I’ma tell you something that’s good for your health
Never give up on yourself (on yourself)
You never know when it’s your turn to get rich
Brand new whip with a bad lil' bitch
Hun'ed thousand dollars on your first car
Shit can really happen when you work hard
I’ma do it till I’m dead and gone--'Short, dawg (what' you doing)?
I’m having hella fun

[Hook] x 2
My neck and wrist be shinin' in the sun
All big faces, ain’t none of these ones
Out here getting it in the California slums
Because ballin' is fun

[Verse 3: B-Legit]
16 zippers in a one pound bag, 16 strippers getting down like that
Move around like that, beaver doing great
I remember out of state can't ache for great
I remember how the stake and that [?]
Just touched back down so I’m extra straight
Got a date with an Asian she be raisin' the bar
On half down town, wanna' fuck my car
I’m a real rap star, got the felony flow
Like I robed the bass line and fucked the melody slow
[?] you know, oh, we gon' get rich
Bitch listen to a pimp when he talking that shit
I keep the wood in the whip, kush in the swish
You never seen a black nigga ball like this
In every magazine I be all like this
With the 40k rolly on the wrist

[Hook] x 2
My neck and wrist be shinin' in the sun
All big faces, ain’t none of these ones
Out here getting it in the California slums
Because ballin' is fun(B-Legit)

Forth to the liquor store buyin
Jugs and jugs of tha shit because I'm addicted with no denying
Pervin
Swervin, runnin all into the fuckin curb and
If I get one more D.U.I. then it's curtains
I can't call it, I guess I'm a alcoholic sometimes I hit the chronic
It's
Just like gin and tonic when it's time to get erotic
5.99 for a big ass bottle of Rossi wine it's right on time
Once you become a
Member of my drinkin' club you will find
The key to set ya free so give it a try
But don't mistake it for Chablis unless you already high
Spread the word get sprung and drink it with your down chromies
That's another word for sahobs, patna, folks, homies
Every motherfuckin' year
We do this shit every other fuckin' day if not every day
But anyway I want

Chorus

(B-Legit)
Hocus motherfuckin' Pocus
The top of the line wine yeah, nigga, that's the dopest
And if you in The Click, them motherfuckers notice
That we be downin jugs from the tallest to the shortest
Everywhere I go, people wants to know
What's the name of that shit you and the Click be like fuckin' wit
I keeps it on a hush on the ... cause brother I be perved
Fuckin' wit some shit that will send you to the curb
And if you wit a bitch, then nigga you nice
Cause Rossi goes good wit some dank over ice
Take her to the telly let the wine fill her belly
Fired up some smelly then ya jammin' like jelly
Bust a couple of nuts, hit the butt and than the grill
Dick hard like I did time up in Vacaville
But still I be bossy
(E-40)
What you fuckin' wit though?

Fuck wit some of that top of the line wine
(E-40)

Carlos Rossi

Chorus

(E-40)
Sunny day, sky blue, shit, I think I'mma barbecue

Mugzy you bring the hamburger meat, and I'll supply the
Drinks

Over a G within a week off the Carlos Rossi[Intro]

To a top, top, top - (big rigga)

Check it
Check it out, check it out, check it out, check it
Check it out

[B-Legit]
It ain't a cell in this town that can hold me
And fuck the task force cause them suckas tried to fold me, scold me
Told me if I move that they was blastin'
Got me to the station, hella questions they be askin'
Who's a big baller? Who supply your crew?
Who got them big birdies in the box, is it you?
I never said a word, cause nigga I don't do so
You fools got some questions, better ask the lawyer Russo

[Kurupt]
I'm so international, and all about my cashional
18 milly irrational, speak mice
What you want fool, dogg tell me what you need
Bought a couple pints of Hennessey, an eighth of weed
It seems time's gettin' shorter
Time to elevate from nickels, dimes, dubs, to quarters
Kurupt, B-Legit, and 40 Water
Niggas oughta - get to swervin'
Take a hit, hit the strip, then get to pervin'

[E-40]
Uh squa uh, squab music, mob music
Ride on a motherfucker and draw down on his ass in music
The 213, the 41510
Pull a ho without a motherfuckin' tug of war
40 Water, your playa partner
Ever since the womb, I've been a tycoon
Actin' up (actin' up)
Actin' tough (actin' tough)
Actin' bad with all kinds of guns and stuff

[Hook] - X 2
From a nickel and dime ass nigga
To a top hat ballin' big rigga
From a nickel and dime ass nigga
To a top hat ballin' big rigga

[Kurupt]
I got a half a ounce, and a 'four to bounce
A half a brick to flip, large amount accounts
Life as a young nigga with loot don't count
Life as a young nigga with loot turned out
You know it ain't nothin' to it but to do it
Flow like fluid, you's included
Pursue it, subdue it, and run through it
Doin' what I do, it's hard to maintain my composure
Ah man, they came through with the doja, it's on

[B-Legit]
The motherfuckin' County ain't the place for the savage
A cock hound dank, smoke a nigga 'bout his cabbage
But if I'm ever caught I'mma ride my shit
Divorce my broad, but nigga keep my bitch
Bury my mail in my momma backyard
Steady poppin' cons to correctional guards
They fucks with my crew cause they claim that we be trouble
Them niggas from the V to the H-I double
I'm tryin' to get this party, tonight at this motel
A gang of bitches there, some more on my voice mail
Bathtub full of the ice and the fifths
My homie K-1 rollin' blunts at the crib
First I take a hit, strolls like a pimp
The motherfuckin' savage with the million dollar limp
Another big day for this timin' ass baller
Hit the block, stock in my ninety fin Impala
Let them pipes holla, I know I'm lookin' saucy
Nineteen shots, sittin' next to my faulty
Stash my notch, shake the spot and gets far
Bitch, I'm a motherfuckin' rap star

[Hook] - X 2
From a nickel and dime ass nigga
To a top hat ballin' big rigga
From a nickel and dime ass nigga
To a top hat ballin' big rigga

[E-40]
Open shop with a sixteenth of powder to a whole zip
To a half ham, now I'm sittin' kilogram
Niggas 'spect me to the upmost cause I'm highly spoken 'bout
Niggas love me cause they know I'ms 'bout my paper route
I keeps my lawyers and my bail bondsmen paid
Shit, for all I know they might decide to raid shit
Back in the day po-po was easily out-smarted
But now they got some new and improved state of the art shit

[B-Legit]
Man, it's goin' down, am I livin' in the past?
This modern day slavery takin' toll on my ass
You either take me in, or let this timer go
Or if you got some charges nigga let this timer know
I told you I'm a rapper, love to entertain
Catch me on the stage with a mic spittin' game
Legit's my name and you can even ask your daughter
About Kurupt, B-Legit, and 40 Water

[Hook] - X 4

Levitti:

B-Legit:
We checked in in the suite up in Hollywood
And the bubble bath did your playa patna good
She brought lingerie, pumps, and body oil
Scented candles and rubbed on my love handles
I'm only in for one night
My flight'll be out in the morning
I better get it before I start snoring
She was already up on top
Goin' buck for the whip cream, cherries and nuts

Levitti:
That's why little sister loved to give it up
Two in the morning I was all in her
You know I had to be the creeper
She kept jockin I have the fever

I'm in your city
Would you come and swoop me

B-Legit:
Five in the mornin' hit me with the wakeup call
Whole room smellin' just like alcohol

But now I gotta giddi y'all

And keep it like that 'till I get back baby
And maybe next time we can take it to the 'nitti

Put two on the ten, all protected an tryin to impress a bitch
Don't you know I'm all off pullin licks
On busta brown ass zarks like you
Scopin an casin 2-11's an holdin patience

(B-Legit)
I huddle wit the dogs up on defense day
Lieutenants get the kicks, backwoods of the Yay
Soldiers leave the place, so the cream I keep
Six or seven g's everytime I beep
Hit the streets like I can't, plot fo the bank
Fuck wit a boss, cuz a pit got rank
Make yo body stank, leave you lost in the woods
A nigga from the hood, up to no damn good
We ride Fleetwood, hit 'em dummied out
Walk a clerk to the safe, an get the money out
I'm on a money route, and all cash I claim
A nigga deep in this muthafuckin game

B-Legit from what I understand, his breath was stronger than his bite

Than a sold out Lennox Lewis an Evander Holyfield fight, shit
We ain't no strong or soft niggas, we savage damn it
Like who?? like the crocodile hunter
That crazy ass muthafucka named Steve
Who caught me doin' dirt, cuz I'm dirt cheap
An I like to do most of my dirt when most of y'all be asleep
Down an dirty, 'specialy when I'm doin' dirt bad
Pull akickdoe, run up in yo baby mama's pad

(B-Legit)
I been it down from day uno
Baby bottle full of pruno
Knew I was the shit named B-Legit
Had a thang fo bakin soda, an high info
Couldn't wait to put the Vogues on a 7-8 rogue
I'm on a telephone, my communicator
On the track wit the team, gettin hella paper
Fuck a playa hata, see he cheats to win
An me, I be the B-Soft Gin
Cuz I'm the man wit it
Got the taste of blood
So dirty when I'm wet that I turn to mud

(E-40)
Them badgers
Them bitches
Them batches
The got my faulty tapped
But the po-po's hate it
Cuz I be talkin in code
Street slang, so they can't interpretate it
An the only way that they gonna be able to interpretate
It is if they go out and get a reliable source
Which is a snitch, a fuckin affidavit
One that gives up very important valuable information to the vice
A rathead, a rathead, turns in they mama for the right price
Money hungry for bread, you wussy, willow ass
Bitch-made niggas workin for them
It's hoes like you that got us doin' dirt bad
Biatch!!

BIIIIIIIIII-AAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYAAAAAAAAAAA-TCH!![Hook]
I'm always drunk in San Francisco [X6]

[Verse 1: San Quinn]
It's a staring artist, in need of racks
You heard him too? I'll drink to that
Sittin' at the beach, drinking like a fish
Fit the privilege, arguing with my bitch
She said I need to quit, or find another groupie
Then she took the car, made me ride the munie
Bottle gone, at the bus had to hobble on
Like a real wine-o, gettin' my wobble on
End of the market, busy drunk talking to the homies
Listen tellin' Lauren diggin' in the garbage
Fuck, like I'm not a star
Lookin' for another card, free ride on the cable car
From brown to white, China Town on the hype
Patron shot after shot, no water and Sprite
Lookin' for a fight, runnin' up on tourists
Not too aware, but I'm for sure, ripped
See me on one, let me be me
You better calling SFPD

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tuf Luv]
What time is it? what day it is?
How the hell I end up it the baby crib?
I don't drink much, but when a nigga do
I get drunker than a pirate in a sailor suit
I'm on a bar with a bottle in my back pocket
Me and Paul Masson, just left crackin'
We about to go kick it with Brandy
Her and her little sister Landy
At 11:45, at my pier at 39
Had the bar at a dime, with a beer and a lime
Somebody try to draw the line I try to stop the cakes
Soon as the bottle hit my lips I'm like Frank Buttes
Drunk at the curb, askin' for my money back
Slurring words, yelling "what the look you fuckin' at"
Now everybody lookin', like ain't that a bitch
I'm at the 'Niner game, in that Raider fit
At the Giant's game, in that A's hat
When people flip me off, I just wave back

[Hook]

[Verse 3: B-Legit]
Yeah, I know the club owner, I like to rub on her
I'm in the crib with 3 shots and a cold Corona
I run laps like the 500 Daytona
Tell I find fine women, wanna know my persona
Then I'm on her like a light switch
The right bitch, that'll try to fuck a dyke bitch
I take her out to Candlestick
Get another 50cs she can handle with
That nigga B-Le, he be on that black
Cognac, Hennessy, yeah he fuck with that
I seen him at the Glass Cat
Gettin' splat at the back, it was hella racks
And, boy if you only knew
What I do, when I ride through them avenues
I'm talkin' 21, 22
My heels on, she about 6 in the few
I let them know what the thing do
We brought our shoes on so it cool, baby, act a fool

[Hook]So much mail I can hardly spend it
VS lumps in my rolex pendent
Shit been spending for the past ten years
Face done escaped all tatooed tears
I guess I can only thank the Lord for that
'Cuz shit was gettin' hectice tryin' to get my scratch
If it wasn't them one time penelopes
It was coward ass niggas tryin' to take my G's
When I first started out I was broke as a bitch
Grew up in the slums wouldn't trade it for shit
'Cuz the niggas that was rich when I was poor
Is now on blow and comin' through buyin fat 2-0
See they spend it with me
But pretendin' to be
On the grind
Tryin' to get a stack like mine
But now I'm knowin'
Pockets growin'
And when it's snowin'
???????
Yo' nigga can't lie I was livin' it up
The rule of big pimpin' now my '70 Cut'
I probably hit the park drinkin on Bo's berry
Slammin' Rick James 'cuz I'm in love with Mary
You can't be scary if you want your scrill
Pack you steel
Nigga kill at will
Guard your grille
'Cuz if you real
Then it's on
I'm talkin' so long

X4
Oh so long making my revi's

So many playas comin' up in the game
And everybody got a sack of rock cocaine
Mobb car drivin'
Condo livin'
And every fuckin' day was just like Thanksgiving
The city where I'm from is getting so damn cold
Niggas outta control
At 16 years old
Them young muthafuckas ain't givin' a fuck
They tryin' to get a buck
And get some hair on their nuts
The savage ass grind starting takin' my mind
A nigga came through with all new tec-9's
Semi-automatic with extended clips
A chopper every nigga down with my click
Neighborhood funkin'
Mail's on slow
It's barely comin' through
And all I'm sellin is O's
I ride high performance when it gets like this
Electric everything, racing cam and kits
I'm livin' on the edge but I'm lovin' the high
I'm either goin' down or I'm goin' die
Hot ones echo through the geto limp
Put the tip out the window let the AK spit
They just caught my homey with a pound of crack
Plus the other day they said he robbed a bank
A million dollar bail in his Uncle's own
All charges got dropped cuz it's oh so long

X4
Oh so long making my revi's

My Momma must have prayed real hard for me
'Cuz I woke up in the mornin' wasn't slanging no D
I was on my way out to the church to see
If the Lord could find a better way today for B
Read me some scriptures
Fed my soul
And I'll tell you like this I ain't slangin' no more
Your boys been blessed in so many ways
In the night and in the day and in His name I pray
Thanks for the Lexus, jewels, and home
Even though I can't take 'em with me when I'm gone
But Heaven is the place for Legitimate B
So when You come and get Your folks You comin' for me

X4
Oh so long making my revi'sArtist: B-Legit f/ Big Bone, D-Day
Album: The Hemp Museum
Song: Get's Down Like That

B-Legit:

I clear the corners like homers with the bass is strong(?)
They can't stand to see me with it so I fakes no funk
No punk in my bloodline
Just killas and shit
Ride to town like the biggest dope dealers with grip, bitch
It ain't easy being wealthy
Staying healthy
Knowing sucka muthufuckas they want to melt me
But I ain't ice cream, butter, or the cheddar cheese
You better peep the Berreta of a nigga sleep

Big Bone:

'Cuz they be knowin' about the city that I'm comin out of
Check your shit
You might come up short of your hefty grip
We nightcrawlers straight underground
Jackin' you for your shit nigga
What you gonna do now
When you see us niggas comin' through
Grab your bitch and your kids
We want 'em too
Yeah, 'cuz playaz come out when it's sunny
But when night time comes
Those playaz turn into gangstas and get they money

D-Day:

All the time I'm pumpin dope
For those who underestimate the propa shit
And won't quit until I accumulate the propa grip
So don't trip
As we get with these fools who thought they knew
From the gate
Keep it straight when fuckin' with my crew
'Cuz I'll be going up out my way to keep this shit straight
Mobb down about the town like a pancake
Earthquake I'm shakin 'em up like my hurricane
Applying pressure whenever and it's a damn shame

Chorus(X2)
We spit the superfly shit
Makin' a bitch say hey
Them Sick Wid' It niggas get they cash money
We keep them pistols and gats
Down for peelin' them caps
'Cuz them niggas from my camp get's down like that

D-Day:

Keep on hearin' niggas hollin 'bout they ass gotta go
And where they gotta be
One more time I kick rhymes and they don't wanna see
Do Rae Me
Rippin' shit on this M-I-C
Down with two more muthafuckas
Who finna spit it see

Big Bone:

Fuckin with this rap could be bubblelicous
Clear the industry of guppies and goldfishes
We spit the super fly raps
Makin' a bitch say shit
Who the fuck could it be
A-1 and B-Legit

B-Legit:

They got me twisted as hell
It seems I see some females
Some long ass weaves guess jeans and lee nails
But I can't tell
The corbel ain't got me brainy
Bitches all stuck to my paint 'cuz I'm candy
Hand me the muthafuckin' blunt ba-by
I do's a bird 35 down I-Eigh-ty
I'm tryin' to get this bitch to the show now
Oh you know it go down
Fuckin with the t-nown bitch

Chorus(X2)
We spit the superfly shit
Makin' a bitch say hey
Them Sick Wid' It niggas get they cash money
We keep them pistols and gats
Down for peelin' them caps
'Cuz them niggas from my camp get's down like that

Big Bone:

I'm clowin' muthafuckas givin' 'em away
Got your whole block flooded with meth and yay
Tell the asian man I'm on my way
I need major hook
Niggas hog moggin'
Tryin' to keep the whole book
But it don't go down like that
I bring the heat
Leave a nigga relaxing in his front seat
Head back like he asleep
With the reak of a muddy lake
Caught a man code 3 bring the yellow tape

D-Day:

As I get in where I fit in
Some funky ass shit
Down with niggas in my click
To let 'em know who they be fuckin' wit'
Got the shit locked down like up in SQ
Comin' new in '96 is what you best do
I test 1,2 and then I straight run through
Up in the V-A double where you best come true
'Cuz I'll be choppin' up on this game like a ginsu
And all you bitches and tricks know what a nigga like me into

B-Legit:

Some thousand gram units with the cash around 'em
I'll pour 'em out the window
And the task they found 'em
They try to get a nigga
But it's too much scratch
And fools from my camp get's down like that

Chorus(X4)
We spit the superfly shit
Makin' a bitch say hey
Them Sick Wid' It niggas get they cash money
We keep them pistols and gats
Down for peelin' them caps
Cuz them niggas from my camp get's down like thatA young hog in the hood playin' chase
Smile on his face
Havin' fun 'cuz it ain't nothin' like this place
And you don't wanna race
Fool I got the new ones on
And we can run from the corner to the Newman's home
And after that we goin' go raid the plum tree
And stick ball down where those bos be
Mom's got the door open bumpin' Marvin Gaye
Let's get it on all day everyday
At night I pray
Lord just let me make it
And if I die before I wake then my soul you take it
Never fake it
My older brother taught me game
And sometimes even let the young soldier hang
As a loc
My only duty was to soak
And pass it on to my comrads and closest folks
All friends I knew about it as a child
I stood proud have you ever seen a ghetto smile?

I'm at the junior high actin bad at the dance
The slow jam got me with a woody in my pants
And my baby with me
Her Momma used to babysit me
And back then she was just plain old pretty
But nowadays it seems that she done grown
Jeans fitting and her perm gotta hella long
Would I be wrong if I whisper and take her down
And maybe play housesitter with her like the Pound
It's goin' down about now in the Northern Bay
The OG's put it down and make they pay
Flip a 6-8 'stang with the blew out braids
The only homey in the hood ridin' on thangs
And as I peep it thangs have got a little deeper
And everybody and their Momma done bought a beeper
And then they post on the lake gettin' loose and wild
You know the scene it's the ghetto smile

At 18 I graduated and now I'm grown
About time for the dog to get his own bone
I left home got a condo out on Quailridge
And like a king is how this young playa live
Swimmin' parties in the pool with my dope to roll
Wasn't trippin' off nathin' we was all folks
Hillside in the house and we gettin' perved
Freestylin' gettin' on my neighbor's nerves
I love the hood so everyday I'm back to visit
And swoop the young so that they can come through and kick it
And peep the game just as I did as a kid
And watch the savage get his cabbage and place his bid
And even though we fight we still remain game tight
Handle business and always open for fogiveness
It ain't nothin' like a homey you ain't seen in awhile
So when you meet him greet him with that ghetto smile[Little Bruce:]
I got Now and Laters, bubblegum, and sour candies
With a trunk load of cookies like Amos 'n' Andy
Got the bud from Hershey and Mr. M&M's
And me and Willy Wonka is old school friends
It's the American dream
On the triple beam
Little Bruce got the bomb-ass cookies and cream
And I'm serving more kids than Chuck E. Cheese
And a German chocolate cake'll cost you 16 Gs

[B-Legit:]
It's the big time billa
Sucka side killa
Real about the fetti
No Ben baby
Got a truckload ready for the hillside ride
Bombay all the way from the Bay we slide
Through your hood
Getting off our goods
Fiending for a knot
We put it in the box
We got a brand new batch
And we put in the smash
Better get it cause we selling out fast

[Hook:]
You gotta buy dope from us
You gotta buy dope from us
You gotta buy dope from us
If you wanna ball please
If you wanna stack Gs
You gotta buy dope from us
If you wanna ball please
If you wanna stack Gs
You gotta buy dope from us

[B-Legit:]
I got variety packs
Hit so fat
And that's platinum status
I'ma let you have it
It's on for a little bit or nothin' at all
I'm going wholesale
I needs mail from all

[C-Bo:]
Suitcase full of G's
400SC
It's the candy man with all the cream
I put the candy on the triple beam
The ziplock baggies
Distribute to the nation to have your whole crew cavied
Now fools want to blast me because I'm ballin'
Cause got more cream than 31 flavors at Baskin Robbins
Slanging thangs for 16, 9 for half
Got ya flying to the Westside to double up your cash

[Little Bruce:]
I'm playing chase with the FEDS
And got the DAs pissed
They raided my spot
Shot both my pits
While I was in Atlanta smokin Swisher Sweets lounging
Counting hundred thousands in the Lexus clowing

[Hook]

[Answering Machine:]
What's happening?
You reached Sik Wid It slash Jive
Leave your name and number at tone
I'll get right back at you
*Playa, we at the All-Star game in San Antonio
You and Bruce meet us here and don't to forget to bring it*

[Little Bruce:]
I hit the All-Star game with a thang my backpack
Ain't on no train, we rolling nice ass Cadillacs
The Northstar system on 100 spoke Daytons
I smokes big with Reider and Gary Payton
Behind the back door where ballers be livin'
Transactions on nationwide television

[C-Bo:]
I'm down to make cheese
Slanging straight cream
In the land of milk and honey
On a mission about the money
Breaking down in quarters
Saran wrappin' across the border
In my 500 Ben behind the '96 Explorer

[B-Legit:]
I pull the keys out my pocket
And I started to G
Bo-Loc back seat strapped down with heat
Track after track
Unit after unit
Running straight through it
It ain't nothing to it
It's kind of like me sprung out on doves
And when you buy dope you better buy it from us

Me myself and I the only one that I can trust
Sleep with one eye open, finger on my pistol clutch
I got my hand in everything, I'm real instrumental
I'm as real as they come, ain't got no bitch per-tential
When I was comin up, there's certain things we don't allow
Like long fingernails, and men archin they eyebrow
Here's another thing I don't condone and don't approve
How all of a sudden snitchin became cool? (I don't know)
I'm gamed up, I be chewin on this mack granite
O.G. J.B. stomp down, lace the nigga, 'sposed to never panic
I bump the baddest broad in the whole facilitation
All by way of mouthpiece, just by mind manipulation
I can make it look like I'm at my best when I'm at my worst
Persuade a broad to put on the dress, and break her for her purse

The law ain't concerned, they love us hustlers and dealers
They wanna tear our houses down so they can build some Ikeas
Oooooh - wow! Just tryin to get my point across
Where I'm from it's pandemonium and chaos
Where I'm from the lights is off, we use matches
Where I'm from we do it barefaced instead of ski-masks
Caw-caw-caw-caw, no more talkin on them cells
I heard the fed-a-rel went ahead and bought NexTel

They got us sleepin in the gym instead of our own cells

(burps an throwin up til end.)[Celly Cel]
I roll 360 degrees and slidin' to the function
Shirley-locks in my hair, yelling 'Bump Something'
Menage-a-trois, need about three with me in this spot
Mixing up my Drizze while they stizz up on that row, but
See, I'm a ridah, when I flash it ain't nowhere to hide ya
I'm right besides ya 'bout to let these thangs all up inside ya
There ain't no sense tryin' to knock a playa for the way he lounge
Even the haters in your town sing it's going down

[Rappin' 4-Tay]
Up in the spot, fool got popped, killed a cop, jumped in a drop
That was the life he lived but now it's honded
Imagine your dome posted on America's Most Wanted
They flowned it and locked him up for conniving
Whether the strong surviving
Or getting pimped by the system
I still be 4 1 5 ing it down to the V
With that fool Celly C E L L
Shakin' it, breakin' it, movin' it with this clientele
With this underground, it's going down
Ha ha

1- [Celly Cel] (Kerry)
Ride with your folks (It's going down)
Sideways in a cloud of smoke (It's going down)
Bumping 'til your amps blow (It's going down)
'Cuz you know it's going down for sure
(Tonight it goes down)

Ride with your folks (It's going down)
Sideways in a cloud of smoke (It's going down)
Bumping 'til your amps blow (It's going down)
'Cuz you know it's going down for sure
(Tonight it goes down)

[E-40]
Get up, uh, I'd like to, uh, dig you when I dug
Biatches ask mah 'How deep is your love?'
Grew up on that: who put dem hickeys on your neck?
Ugh, how many babies did you make off that Keith Sweat?
Don't even trip it's all labexibiali fitty
Hit the clubs and act bad, get them biatches ready
Up on release, Forty youze a cold piece
You hardly war makin', drinkin', shootin' me out, it's soft

[B-Legit]
It's off the fenzo, I ride the Benzo, Bill Clinton, presidential
Out the window, never been, though
Type that get the party loud trunkin'
So they can hear me, I keep 'em leery
With twamps on the S Series
And Cruise Control, gonna take 'em where them hoochies roll
If for some dough, them hoochies down to sell they soul
So, when you see me double-parked, flashing hazard lights
You get it right, cuz, man, it's going down tonight

Repeat 1

[Mack 10]
West Side! You know who he be Hoo Banging
It's that killer Mack 10, Inglewood swingin'
And connect gangin' and ya know that's how it go
Although it ain't gonna be easy but believe me, dog
It's gonna be off the heezy fo' sheezy
And if it ain't, huh, I laugh it off like a joke
And I grab my AK cuz I spray up anybody for my folks in the Bay
On the real, homeboy, I'm a killer
I leave your shirt soakin', no jokin'
So if it's going down tonight
I be on the first thing smokin', so holler at me

[Celly Cel]
It's going down so majorly my pager battery
Stay on low cells while I'm trying to get some mo' mail
Dodgin' hot ones, makin' liquor store runs
Creepin' through the city streets, pervin' and I'm on one
Can't get wrapped up in that "He said she said"
What was said already did, runnin' your mouth will get you filled with lead
So I stay real, soakin' that game outta the hills
Ridin' with that Mazda sound
Now you know it's going down

Repeat 1 to fade[Intro: B-Legit]
Check one
I'm back in the piece man, you know what I'm talking about yea
About to roll em in one of these motherfucking
Raw papers
With gelato, you dig?
Put a little cookie crumb on that motherfucker
See what that do
[?]snowman[?], you dig?
Man we just getting high
I mean, what else we gonna do, nigga

[Verse 1: B-Legit]
Ask me how I feel about the marijuana
I tell you that I love it like I love my mama
We don't do confusion and all the drama
We be with the crew, little benihana
California state, Chico up north
Get it to the bay, it's some buckmore
Travel up top with some fuck foe
They ain't even got what a nigga ride
Gelato with my raw with the cookie crumb
On my instagram putting hella thumbs
Fuck around you gonna need another lung
Probably where your favorite rapper get it from
White boys and the tube rolling [?] up
New strain, bout to enter that in the cup
With the harvest coming up, Ima move around
High as health care nigga I ain't coming down

[Interlude]
For what?
Nigga, thats what we do
It's what we been doing
Nigga hit me on the next album dank site
I want some of that shit you and Berner be having on your IG
I said man, you have to get at Berner about that boy

[Verse 2: Berner]
Roll another one smoke the pain away
I'm in the bay getting paid in a major way
When that box show up, how you supposed to feel?
One-hundred and fifty grand wrapped with a vacuum seal
Took (serb)[?], put his back on the map again
Long nights, no sleep, sick of traffic cam
Wax made me never want to dab again
Buy more bags, put the candy in
It's outdoor season and I'm loving it
Price so low, they can't get enough of it
Snowman get me on my own hype
Fuck a new chain, baby buy me grow lights
I'm in the G-Spot, yea the weed spot
The shit will make you sweat like a (key sap)[?]
Clear on my rolling no G-Shock
New Benz cost about three blocks
Let the smoke clear homie, ima pot-head
Weed got a mountain like a hop head
F-1 burning out the room smell
Like the pelly did back early two-thou
Nice way, pretty bitch, few pre-rows
We let the coke bricks fly with the igloos
Ima beast with the weed shit
Me and B-Legit, we let the peace flip

[Outro]Artist: E-40 f/ 2Pac, B-Legit
Album: Tha Hall of Game
Song: Million Dollar Spot

Righteous people be knowin what I be doin is protect my peoples
Million dollar spot
Uhh, that's right, uhh, my million dollar spot
My million dollar spot (beyatch) my million dollar spot
My million dollar spot, on the block bring it hot (beyatch)
On the spot, my million dollar spot, uhh

Verse One: E-40

Major loot, seriously niggas don't wanna dispute
Mysteriously a nigga die, when you play this game and ain't know the time
I suck the life out your ass by pushin mute
Shit can get stanky like a poot (like a poot)
I got dog poop crank yes I pollute
Leave the whole block fully unrecouped
I'm like a record company, givin out advancements
Get my money back, by any circumstances
My million dollar spot, not to mention
Drive through service, Church's chicken
A bu-a-bucket full of acid by the do'
Just in case I gotta throw away my yole
Bars around the house, bars around the window
Dope around the corner, broken down Pinto
You can tell who got the mail who got the biggest chops
My million dollar spot... beyatch!

Chorus: 2Pac (with singing in background)

I can take a chance, I could live in cans
Bring it on the block, my million dollar spot
Haha, my million dollar spot bigger
I can take a chance, I could live in cans
Get my motherfuckin cash on
You know how we do it out here in California, beatch!
Bring it on the block, my million dollar spot

Verse Two: 2Pac

It was, more than just a dream for me
To be the King it seems I need a killer team to get the green for me
Hit the scene clean in my Chevy, now I'm ready for trouble
Count my rocks, set up shop, collect my fetti and bubble
Faded visions of me as a timer
Though marijuana clouds my vision I'm still watch for drama, ha-ha
They got me crossed tryin to be the boss, no one can stop us
Niggas dream of six figures, handle our business in choppers
Feds can't comprehend my ghetto slang, so I evade
And plot and plan a life of better thangs, all about my chedder main
Help me if I fall, can I ball for life
A half a key in my drawers, bein cautious like
I wanna rise keep my eyes open
Witness motherfuckers die with they eyes open, my niggas rise smokin
Any busta bitch tryin to stop my wish
To have a million dollar spot gettin riches, nigga

Chorus: 2Pac (singing in background)

I can take a chance, I could live in cans
In my million dollar spot
Bring it on the block, million dollar spot
Get your money nigga! Fuck the cops, in my million dollar spot
I can take a chance, I could live in cans
We got rocks, coke and hops, in my million dollar spot
Gimme all your motherfuckin money all money good money
Bring it on the block, million dollar spot
Hear me, get money nigga!

Verse Three: B-Legit

Nuttin but the motherfuckin hog in me
Hit the Hillside trapped with thirty-six O-Z's
Serve nothin but doves, no twat no love
Now nigga don't make me get these burner gloves
I got the whole block jumpin like the Mardi Gras
Nothin but a dope fiend party y'all
I'm lovin this game, it's my favorite sport
Come short get burnt with the Newport
I'm in the four-oh, and 'Pac came to see me
Smobbin in a nine-six drop rose Bentley, shit be
Caution for these niggas on the ocean
A sip of the potion now your nigga be in motion
Bossin hopin fede-ral thieves don't raid
Catch me with a Glock and a box of grenades
I'm tryin to get paid, all about my lucci
Now bitch put this motherfuckin key in your coochie

Outro: E-40

Motherfuckers ho hard!
Ya understand that? Motherfuckers ho hard!
We got shit jumpin off on every spot
We got crank methamphetamines
Dope for ass to get yo' cash, motherfucker
We got big pimpin, ya understand
We got solicitin, ya know
We got all kind of shit, prostitution
It don't stop
Motherfucker tryin to just get his cash on the motherfuckin
Million dollar spot, BEYATCH!

I can take a chance, I could live in cans
That's right, my million dollar spot
Bring it on the block, my million dollar spot
Uhh, for ya knot, my million dollar spot
I can take a chance, I could live in cans
My million dollar spot, my million dollar spot

Righteous people know what I be doin be protectin my peoples
