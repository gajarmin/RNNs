[Intro]
(I'm with this)

[Hook: (Pete Rock)]
Complexion (two-step)
Complexion don't mean a thing (it's a Zulu love)
Complexion (two-step)
It all feels the same (it's a Zulu love)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Dark as the midnight hour or bright as the mornin' sun
Give a fuck about your complexion, I know what the Germans done
Sneak (dissin’)
Sneak me through the back window, I’m a good field nigga
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down
Even if master listenin', cover your ears, he 'bout to mention

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Dark as the midnight hour, I'm bright as the mornin' sun
Brown skinned, but your blue eyes tell me your mama can't run
Sneak (dissin')
Sneak me through the back window, I’m a good field nigga
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down
Even if master's listenin', I got the world's attention
So I'mma say somethin' that's vital and critical for survival
Of mankind, if he lyin', color should never rival
Beauty is what you make it, I used to be so mistaken
By different shades of faces
Then Whit told me, "A woman is woman, love the creation"
It all came from God then you was my confirmation
I came to where you reside
And looked around to see more sights for sore eyes
Let the Willie Lynch theory reverse a million times with...

[Hook]

[Interlude]
You like it, I love it (x8)
(Where the homegirl Rapsody at?
I need you to speak your mind real quick loved one!)

[Verse 3: Rapsody]
Let me talk my Stu Scott, ‘scuse me on my 2Pac
Keep your head up, when did you stop loving thy
Color of your skin, color of your eyes
That’s the real blues, baby, like you met Jay’s baby
You blew me away, you think more beauty in blue, green and grey
All my solemn men up north, 12 years a slave
12 years of age, thinkin’ my shade too dark
I love myself, I no longer need Cupid
Enforcin’ my dark side like a young George Lucas
Light don’t mean you smart, bein’ dark don’t make you stupid
And frame of mind for them bustas, ain’t talkin’ “Woohah!”
Need a paradox for the pair of doc's they tutored
Like two Todd's, L-L, you lose two times
If you don’t see you beautiful in your complexion
It ain’t complex to put it in context
Find the air beneath the kite, that’s the context
Yeah, baby, I’m conscious, ain’t no contest
If you like it, I love it, all your earth tones been blessed
Ain’t no stress, jigga boos wanna be
I ain’t talkin’ Jay, I ain’t talkin’ Bey
I’m talkin’ days we got school watchin’ movie screens
And spike your self esteem
The new James Bond gon’ be black as me
Black as brown, hazelnut, cinnamon, black tea
And it’s all beautiful to me
Call your brothers magnificent, call all the sisters queens
We all on the same team, blues and pirus, no colors ain’t a thing

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
Barefoot babies with no cares
Teenage gun toters that don’t play fair, should I get out the car?
I don’t see Compton, I see something much worse
The land of the landmines, the hell that’s on earth[Produced by Mr.Porter]

[Hook]
I rain, I rain, I rain, I rain

[Verse 1: Rapsody]
Penny for a beggar, beg to differ
These just my lonely thoughts that sometimes get off with some liquor
So I don't drink so much no more at war wit my own picture
What you thought it was? Cuz I ain't perfect as the dove in scriptures
Tight as two sisters but my favorite color black
They say the color purple royal soil on my back
From the war that I been fighting just to make it off the map
I was waiting for the sun to set, they intrigued with my black
I guess the pitch is like my soul
Worn out just like my Fo's
I took the blue pill yesterday
The key to all my goals
Going over songs we like and songs we don’t
Don't wanna fall short as the gnomes and I have yet to visit Rome
24 inches how we used to dream of chrome
Last year my sister moved from New Orleans and she ain't need no loans
We light up like the scones when talkin money trees
How you don't eat pork but smoke holy on tobacco? Weed
I never breath, another breed, Q, Phife, Ali Shaheed
Check the rhyme It's just my time to kill It like the purge this spring
Deep as the valleys in the Philippines and up in Cali
They say this tape is like an album
Threw one in the galaxy all for free
Magna carter I been part of
My independent ass motherfucker they couldn't water
Down look around the takeover dun took over
And we been doing shit that you average rapper can't shoulder
So, what's next I suspect your death
Welcome to the game where we trained to never follows refs
Lot of great players, but we as better as a team
You learned that watching Miami and the spurs just this spring
Scary as the ring in the well
On the scale I weigh like the Bronson or Adele
I'm shell as full jacket metal
Madame I replicated the summer of Sam, damn
Kill at ran-damn (random) Im like Van Damm stuck in a dam
Damn, who is the killa? Wit agility
Flow bend like that around Anguilla
Got the skill of thriller
Came from underground to get a mill or Two
Everyday I've wrote, it seemed to wanna rain a few
I guess I'll reign for you, Philly to NY
Just to wet you up I’m tear ducts to a dry eye
My my what he told me reciting OBI, Kenobi
“you'll be the death of me solely”
I told him showly, I agree I'm Ali, cross um like Doji
Sting like wasps I serve um losses they lowley
Call me young achilles cuz I snap on these like Kobe Now
Back to talking bout my day it went smoothly
I woke up hella early, last night watched a movie
And compared it to my life like 2-D boobies, the come up, like the sun up, when ya son up mornings crying for juices
Adolescents
Never stress um
Developed I bless um
Denaun thanks for the blessing
One of the best in the game
I still remain, outside still writing in the rain, I reign

[Bridge: Chance the Rapper]
Why don't you come home at night no more, no more
Why can't you see past a thing, no more

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
Yeah I see the gun but it's a pellet
Yeah the ball is in your court, but it's appellate
They sayin Acid was an album retail it
I said I got way too much soul for me to sell it
That's why godfather tied the cape on my shoulders
Said save em from false prophets and wolves in sheeps' clothing
I'm a little too hard to be slept on
I'm a little too sharp to be stepped on
A little too Pac for the septum
I'm so pretty I make mirrors blush
I spit the shit in a party to make your ear adjust
I'm a parapalegic parrot with a pair of crutches in a no fly zone
On the phone talking bout how Bush trying to disparage us
There's a metaphor if I expound
There's a better score in the next round
Me and raps go together like donuts and fresh ground
Coffee, I'm awfully softly spoken
In Autumn, fall leaf clovin
My posters on dry wall and my banners are star spangled
My demons get charred, mangled, Chancelor the Archangel
I don't pray for chart singles
I grab life by the ankle like Kurt Angle
And ask it if it's ticklish
Ask me if that's ridiculous
I'm a meticulous fickle dude
That just happens to spit a little bit
And you can tell I rapped this off my phone
Cause you can hear that ringtone in the background but I'm in the zone[Hook: Merna]
Fuck what them say, I don't need it
Them wanna build you today just to tear you down
I don't let them preach, and I don't believe it
See there's no weight to they words, they can't wear me down
I don't need it

[Verse 1]
I woke up satisfied
I'll never let your negativity kill my vibe
I know everybody's dreams don't survive
That's the difference between me and them in this life
Everybody talk a lot
I remember not to follow what they talk about
I know I'm the illest out, sheep gon' be sheep
So I know you'll come around in time
They always do, they don't ever let you down
Talking about everything you need except the crown
Your gift and your passion to them don't ever count
'Til your name and life and money overflowing in accounts
All you bitches look like clowns

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
"Yo, let me apologize for the other types that made you feel like you could ever steal my light
Joy always come in the morning no matter what the night do
Might not be today, but one day they gon' understand you"
I don't need that drama, I don't need to give you light
I was taught: don't give energy to those you don't like
I don't need to go major, made it this far without paper
I don't need that cover either, I don't need none of your favors
Told my mama "We gon' make it", I don't need your funds
I don't need to get naked, I just need to have some fun
I don't need your emo beats, all I want is soul and funk
I don't need your validation, hell, I already done won

[Bridge: Merna]
It's here in your own star
Once you wake up and realize who you are
'Til we know, we don't need it
I don't need it

[Verse 3]
My confidence out the roof
Aquarius in me told me opinions ain't truth
This amusement wasn't amusement for you
When it's showtime I'm on like Kobe Bryant in his youth
I'm Birdman, I'm Birdman, I'm Birdman
My play is not to make you opinions my burden
Whoo! Uh, Damn, Michael Keaton
Shoot the nose to spite the face, I ain't even
Mama say there's more success in succeeding
My complexion in the black this evening
That's the prop that I'm teaching business
Santa Clause to Jehova's Witness
Ain't believe, now they want forgiveness

[Hook][Produced by 9th Wonder]

[Verse]
It's when you walk out on faith
Choose to do what feel right, let everyone else trace
What we chase ain't the same
I'm still that rapper that your favorite rapper scared to rap after
Sometimes it's hard to chill, choose to kill, kill, kill, kill
I'm just that good though I ain't worth a lot of millions
When you rap this well a lot of rappers catch feelings
We all want the best, don't let a female kill 'em, yeah
Hard to choose culture over fame
You just want to be set and take care of all your fame
It don't make you, but it be cool to have money like Wayne
Take the shorter roads so the family ain't worrying
Chose to build it slow, ain't no need, no hurrying
It's hard to be political, can't say what's on your brain
Careers come quick, it's just as fast to bury 'em
But I chose to give a damn
And box for you like pictures on Instagram
Chose to respect what was built by both Kool and Bam
You know who I am, word to my homie Wyann
Shit, ain't hard to choose me there's only one me, man
(So hard to choose)
That's why I chose to be that
Because where I'm from it ain't cool to be wack
And I'm so pro-black
Though they don't choose me back and that's some choosy shit
Why it's so hard to choose y'all over these jewels and whips
Welcome to my side
When you look in the crowd the minority's never white
I appreciate y'all, but I'm lying if it don't bite
Cause I love all races but we gotta raise 'em
Cause I know the scale tipped ain't in no black girl's favor
Hey y'all, we all outcasts, these black girls favor
The blonde Barbie and scars, we all gotta save 'em
No love lost for whites, Latinos and the Asians
Loyal to all, but when I look at these black girls faces
I understand why I chose to be better, not basic
So it's not, not (hard to choose)
Yeah, so excuse if I don't care if hipsters relate
It weren't for you at all, at all why these songs were made
Like you were overlaid at the airport
And missed your sort of take off
Don't understand why we get naked or
Why it's hard to choose being real or being fake, huh?
Cause the world worship people that get their cake up
But I chose to De La Soul and raise the stake up
Now why is it (so hard to choose)?
Yeah, seldom support our own, I helped myself by advancement
Want to make sure our daughters have better chances
But y'all in that show and watching videos
Why it's hard to choose class or let them titties show
But it's better for my heart, honey, like Cheerios
And secondly more comfortable doing [?]
Trying to build you up like I went to Lowe's and bought a lot
MC Lyte, I ain't forgot what you told me
I ain't Hovy, but damn
It's hard to choose being humble or going HAM
Humility's a weakness, I was told different
Quietest in the room is the baddest one like Durant
It's hard to choose Carolina over Atlanta
Chicago, LA, especially in Johannesburg
Yeah, cause it's been love since beginnin'
Home away from home, versus homes we get no spins in
Why it's (so hard to choose)?
Being super lyrical or slowing it down
Will they understand the metaphors and how they compound
With the two lines before and the next three after?
And ask myself does this shit, if it even still matter?
The joints y'all tripping on are so easy and average
And the ones I respect all got that gift mastered
I don't want to compromise my sick self for a master
But it's (so, so hard to choose)
Cause if I don't I'm not cool and I'm boring
Should add a tsch tsch to my beats to be current
This the shit I think about along with image and earnings
But when Nas tell me "God you killin' it" then I'm burning
All thoughts chasing y'all, man, it's easy now
XXL ain't tripping, Time calmed me down
Thinking where we all started from and where we all sitting now
Shit I see it different now, why it's not, not (hard to choose)Part 1
[Hook: Heather Victoria]
Cause he's... the man...

[Verse 1: Rapsody (Heather Victoria)]
Of the house since his dad left, wake up, days feeling stressed
No stability, every year got a new address
Never change the view from this window, he seeing mad arrest
He saw his homie's death, same age, same story
Questioned God, wonder why he would take a such young shorty
It ain't even 8:40, already he thinking poorly
But still he's the (maaaaan)
His mom trust him now to lock the place down
Feed his younger brother and sister, make sure they both lay down
'fore she home, can't be on the phone, gotta wake up early next morn'
He don't have a lot of fun having to be so grown
At night he pray the world just throw him a bone
Tired and stressed
His grades suffer now and they don't know about home
So his teachers on his back again and don't own Foams
Kids pick at him, now he feel he need those to belong
Daydreaming 'bout a life living just like Puff Combs
On his walk to the crib he always hear several blown
Tryna think positive, but everything's wrong
Why his daddy can't be at home and be the mutherfucking (maaaaan)?
Now he gotta a little plan
He can sell a few rocks, maybe make a few grands
Take his family and move 'em and expand 'em to better lands
And be the motherfuckin, and be the motherfuckin (maaaaan)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rapsody]
So he got money and stayed, but ain't get out
Got a new whip now he pushing worth 50 thous'
But his mom, brother, sister still living in public housing
He the man though, gotta put food in all they mouths
His dad skipped, now he's the one to provide they outfits
They won't get picked on like he did, under the couch is
A 9 Milli, he gotta protect the fam, silly
Under circumstances he living to be the man really
Dad dropped by out the blue, he said "damn, you ain't the (maaaaan)"
Look what I did fam
When you ain't bother I stepped up to be the man, man
Now I'm the (maaaaan)
Be out, yo, this my motherfuckin' house
See, I'm the (maaaaaaan)
Around the way I don't respect ya
You just clown to me, yo, I reject ya
You gave me all this pressure, I wasn't even a freshman
Since thirteen man, shit, dawg, I been the (maaaaan)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rapsody]
Now this street life got him running always thinking 'bout the (maaaan)
And now he sets the scene of what he saw when he was ten
Out the window while he sat thinking like (maaaaaan)
I wish It could better, man
I could be a doctor, a teacher, a lawyer talking evidence
Or I could be your weather(maaan)
I had dreams and plans, but gave it up to be the man, see
When my father didn't bother, well, now I'm the (maaaan)

[Hook]

Part 2
[Verse 4: Rapsody]
I pray to God you get it soon, I use Vidal Sassoon to clear my head
Shower and devour stress, I chose to wear a dress today
I got small breasts, but I love me (but I love me)
Do you love me? (Do you love me?)
He says yes he does, I'm his everything
I don't think love's in a wedding ring, it's a business
And I hear both sides lose interest
What's endless hasn't ended
And I'm thinking damn, is this you and me one day?
I don't wanna fade away (f-fade away, f-fade away, f-fade away...)
Like a history, rock and roll, hip hop now but so soul
Soul is what y'all singin'
Long as they payin', to newborns just a day in
Gotta make their life amazing
Don't let the TV raise 'em, raise 'em, raise 'em
Tell 'em how we black as ravens, ravens, yea
But they hatin' and they shoot us
When we march they call us looters
Sitters, says "go get your rugers (get your rugers)"
Yea, used to have  a peaceful mindset
But nowadays peace won't come and justice or a bomb threat
Is how I feel, I need God to heal my heart
How we s'possed to not fight back?
Now we s'possed to not wage war?
I pray to God you get it soon
Another afternoon, different day same story
More convos in our living rooms, huh, nah, we don't need Maury
Yea, confirming all your lies
It's hard to tell our babies they don't care about our lives
Ask us why, they ask us why, why, why, why, why?
They ask us why, why, why, why, why?

[Outro: Children]
"Why don't people like me because of my color?"
"I don't understand"
"Why am I different?"
"Why doesn't my life matter?"
"I'm just like you"
"I'm no different"
"I'm a good kid"
"I like to play"
"I like to hang with my friends"
"Why is the world not in peace?"
"Yes"
"My dad said"
"When I get bigger"
"I have to be really careful"
"Around police"
"But why?"
"I thought police help us"
"I don't understand"
"I don't understand"

"Hello"
"I just want to say hello"[Verse 1: Rapsody]
Dark nights been cold like night veins
Serve niggas chills, I'm ill like Mike Caine
Express and I stress the best, I'm insane
To these bitches like Miranda, I'm lyrically Bruce Wayne
Pain I felt it and belted it out in sorrow
Broke days, way too embarrassed to ask to borrow
A dollar for a quarter a gallon of gas tomorrow
Struggles by the car load had me lower than Carlos
Borders we sorta ignore 'em like fuck a lock yo
No plan drawn still stone cold, a Picasso
Nothing quite impossible, something similar to Pac though
Young poet, we know it, sow it so it'll grow blow
Where the wind take me, money'll never make me
No matter where I go, so money'll never break me
Though I been broke like pieces of soap pasted
To cleanse my soul bands like grams we raising
Reaching for better, it's whatever I'm Kevin Bacon
X men out that want none a part of my making why
Bane ain't a match for this emcee
And Dark Knight bat wings need a M3
All y'all drool for Ra's al Ghul protégé
I've been cold as Jay on "3 Kings" nigga get schooled
I am the, 5'3" Morgan free-flow genius
Underground killer like Bane whole team is
They couldn't cop me now they stuck underneath me
I took a leap of faith and I climbed up easy
Rap-so-deezy and Eric Jones, I Gotham City
I save ya all from the bad rappers in ya city
And let you take a couple jewels like the cat lady
Dark Knights rise again Jamla we back baby
Yea
I say Dark Knights rise again Jamla we back baby
It's so quick to flip and crown a next king
Trip like crips do the blues make us swing
[Low as the flow where chariots rider wings?]
I decoded the message arrested by modern bling
[?] lives that never use knives to bring
Themselves up a notch only took a stab at a dream
Coliseums, used to pray to him, the Elohim
Witnessed the door to door and I guarded it like Hakeem
The Idi Amin of all these idiots mean I know
Toe to toe go with the best that they throw in the ring seen
Lot of despair, pair me with none of them things, two left
Feets only dance to the beats with B's we rep
Honesty, my history Cherokee and it's African
Deep blue cinnamon, every bit of the black in him
Embrace heritage, capitalize like acronyms
We higher seed, no need to deplete it like the Vatican
And Benedict ourself, deplenish all our wealth

[Bridge (repeat until fade): Rapsody]
Never blame a man for misfortune, do it yourself

[Verse 2: Wale]
Ain't rocked a 9th beat in a minute
I ain't even with niggas
You slight breeze, I'm wife beaters in winter
I'm a product of Reaganomics where the law is a greater problem
Where the niggas is spraying something and they got 'em
Word to Robin, that's Gotham
That was fiction but I'm talking about the district
Where business is booming for bird flippers and morticians
And I understand the plight of Bane
Except we using other drugs just to fight the pain
It's coming apart, I'm hoping to God you niggas ain't playing
Cause I'm more Patrick Bateman and y'all Bruce Wayne
And I do my thing really
Folarin spit pepper, young veteran
You niggas lack season like a torn ACL-a
Level headed, I put this wit in yo lady belly
And I bet my digits 'bout as thick as Fat Belly Bella
I'm like the new fella meets (Goodfella)
Good guy turned heel do the crude business
Manute length is a list of niggas that may envy
But I eat danger for lunch, breakfast, and plate empty
And I leave the place with some choice ladies to fellate with me
And I pull hoes like cellos strings, nigga hear my symphony
Of the Opus Mr. Holland ain't got nothing on
Hollerin' at these hollow heads, we both shallow but I am raw
Fly as fuck, who the fuck is y'all to compare me to them peoples
Niggas questioning they outfit like Jim Carrey on the sequel, get me[Verse 1]
Like, Like
Mountains and peaks, valleys I been through
The landlord telling me come through, rent due
Since you seem to have it all figured out
Next month while you coppin’ one, cop’ me a Benz too
They all think just because rhymes being laid
That niggas getting paid, when I struggle like you do
Put out more product and it's better than labels move
Meet the frustration that I never gave into, Nigga
Lauryn ain't crazy, just dont know what she been though
Complaining bout radio, my nigga, got no room
Cause niggas wit opinions dont support you on itunes
Listen, my soul mission was to rap and get paid too
Be someone that these little girls look up to
Now I see the game for what it is, a big chess move
Playing my cards all how they was dealt
I won't blessed with the money so my movement ain't felt
Nigga, smoke and mirrors, look in the mirror
Telling myself, "self ain't you glad your shit is imperial?”
I rule everything around me the C.R.E.A.M
Get your dollar, dollar bills yall this game is all a scheme
For control and being sold is a backwards kinda thing
They saying I'm the future so I’ll never waste my ring
And not answer my calling to be your daughter dream
My train of thought rapid, Im just blowing esteem
Putting fear in these rappers all proclaiming they king
If Maximus had a wife, then to Rome I’d be queen

[Hook]
Believe me, frontin’ niggas gimme heebie jeebies
Believe me, frontin’ niggas gimme heebie jeebies
Believe me, frontin’ niggas gimme heebie jeebies
Believe me, too many of you frontin for TV
Only real live niggas get respect easy
Believe me, frontin’ niggas gimme heebie jeebies
Believe me, frontin’ niggas gimme heebie jeebies

[Verse 2]
Miami beach, ain't seen no water yet
Heavy on mind like Avirex, I X’d
Out distractions, to be the rap rim
Goal that they tryna reach if you needing some evidence
You can ask 9th, address like residence
I'm nothing like these niggas we separate, I'm Evelyn
I spazz out like ex-wives to ballers
You wanna feel something? Then you know who to recommend
Jamla the squad in present tense, the team
Like Dream of '92 that they prayed to the reverend
To rebirth a nation, water distilled
So, when she break water spill, catch the flow like Jacqueline
Onassis, the curse and the gift
Canibus, take notes to you niggas that’s battling, nigga
Whats beef? Cattle and javelin
That shit ain't real nowadays, niggas just actin’ it
Zulu the real, the nation I rep
Keep medallions round my neck like the belt post accident
Kanye West, walk with Jesus my way
How you really all should pray if you knew what was happening
Yo, forget the name, they never can do
Twenty years still touched cuz the flow so passionate
Like prayers up to Jehovah when traveling
Protect me from rap foes and all the fake rap men
Believe me they souls is paper thin, for paper when
Heart ain't gold, I dont find you rich like Solomon
Rap three times nice like the number of wise men
Frontin’ niggas juke 'em every day like Heisman

All black everything, all black you know
All black in the name of all my black heroes
All black everything, all black polos
All black medallions, yeah, all black you know
Say

[Verse 1]
All black everything, polo and socks
Symbolize we not defeated by them system and cops
Word to 9th, and that all black leather I wear
Coatin my skin, Im all black just like a pair of mcnair
Family wore the warm blacks, yo, resemble my hair
They brush it off, pardon them all, they got no reason to care
All T's, all black, cause at the top is Barack
In a stack of all black jeans cause im never gon slack
Black boy shorts on my ass, like teachers stay on short black boys in class, so they grow to lead the masses
Black sunglasses cause my future bright, Molasses
Blackberry, write my rhymes in them every night, they scary
Black scarves, they represent scars and nooses they hung us by
But now they hangin on my word, dueces
Yo, too black to not be a fan of Michael Jack
Word the bible colors all black
Just like my scully cap, cause blacks be on my mind

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
All black belts for all the blacks that didn't buckle
In the stuggle, Black medallions medalin they didn't love us
Crosses burning in our yards, Black bangers for the wrists
Up on the wrist I told them this
Black friday in the black
Just like a prophet I would profit
To the black's worth
To the blackness of my bra
Gon support you
Word, to Phylicia Rashad's black lashes,
All blacks they used to make up all the back of buses
I wear liner on the lids for all my brothers
And the mothers, black picks we stay ahead of dissin black
My bookbag be dippin cause rapsody has got your back
Blacks they be hypin, I'm the light that lit your match
A black watch for all the times I watched MTV raps
Black lights and blues burn when I record for watts
And every black like Troy Davis who never had a fair shot,
All black everything, everything black
Culture over everything, yo, we taking it back
Black[Intro]
Its fair to say the game is at the special place right now
I’ll argue the best and the decade maybe even 20
Rap music comes and goes, rap artists here then gone
Rapsody she’s here to stay, she got game better yet she got the game. (laughs ) ya’ll ready?

[Verse 1]
It's Toca Tuesday the mood gray
Another average news day
Stomache rumbling I'm watchin blue ray
Cleaning out my suitcase
Thinking maybe souffle
Will suit my menu looking thru my closet ain't no Gucci
Pile of laundry just as dirty as this scene that now play
Counting on my fingers tryna make thru da pay day
Neighborhood kids running round loud as lightening
Peep thru my blinds they horse playing fake fighting, shit
Remember when I did the same
Posted up after games
All the older guys knew me just cause of my daddy’s name
So I was always well behaved could never bring the family shame
Played ball yesterday and rolled my ankle, still in pain
Should probably ice it but I'm feeling lazy, I don't care
After this go off I'll watch a marathon of Cliff and Claire
I need to wash my hair but I ain't doing that neither
Finished all the laundry so I've earned myself another breather
I'll skip the souffle and probably just order some pizza
My neighbor two doors down son alway smokin’ reefa
Been in my room all day blasting these weak computer speakers
Between these bare walls with all these retro Jordan sneakers
Last day of school and damn Ms Brann ain't a teacher
Hope I retire just as early I'll spend it eating Pitas
In Grant FILAs, Nautica sweats and wife beaters
And spend my summers telling my kids about Derek Jeter
I grew up off Merita used to learn Spanish in school
Grew up forgot it all but, ehhh my English is cool
So much they say my words in Spain and up in Jeruz
Spent my day doing nothing its just my current mood

I spent my day doing nothing its just mood
I spent my day doing nothing, I ain't that cool like
I spent my day doing nothing its just my groove
I spend my day doing nothing my attitude like
My attitude like
Fuck the world
Attitude like
Fuck, Fuck, Fuck the world
Attitude like
Fuck the world

Currently, I’m secluded with my all passion
I wonder if I'm slightly depressed from all de harassment
Like “when you gon get you a job?” my sister keep asking
In a weird space, but ain't overdosing no aspirins
Another movie night will get my mind tighter
Thinking Tiger
I can bounce BACK from anything I'mma fighter, I'mma fighter
Saw a spider now I'm creeped out
I sleep wit my mouth tighter
Sippin apple cider, I need to add this onto my rider
Random thoughts in my lonely head
The moon red, I ain't a begger, but I beg differ like a leper
Won't add me in your circle, all good I'll make my own
Know I look crazy talking to myself all alone
Wonder if it really help to write it, if you do it stoned?
Hell naw gimme clarity, I fell upon a basketball game
Got me thinking back when I was young
I was good, niggas used to watch me like a game of Thrones
They used to all tell me “you too short to play ever”
So I gave up and in college ain't play never
Thought to myself “naw this won't be same”
So I got myself up cuz I was made for game[Intro: Rapsody]
Ka$h, Ka$h dont make beats, he make
Beautiful music, one-two-one-two
My man Murs, what's up Murs?
Beautiful music

[Verse 1: Rapsody]
Yo, beautiful music it raised me
Like daddy belt when I was actin' all crazy
Sneakin' headphones on the buses to school
While them other fools was fightin', I was rockin' to AZ
The night they made me, probably listened to O'Jays
That's why I love music, keep it runnin' like OJ
In the fashion of most (Mos), wearin' out all the old plays
Black on both sides from my skin to the old Jays
Just yesterday I was rockin' the Ol' Jay
My blueprint, tryin' to see me through it all like Oakleys
He changed the game like Kelly did foreplay
Now they pee-pee in they tee-pee when they see me like Biggie
Nowadays, styles done changed like CK
They inclined to listen to the same song on replay
Keep a gang of stars in the halls where we play
Cause there ain't a lot of songs nowadays they anticipate
Like Jamla, Phonte, Rozay Ricky
It ain't all rosey like Andre say
We lost three legends, Whit, Etta James, MJ
Gotta protect the kids where I live, my pen state (Penn State)
Until they state of mind feelin' every word I say
Beautiful music couldn't beat like old D Dre with Beats
How we beatin' everything that they play?
Beautiful music, my brother man Ka$h done make, it's beautiful

[Hook]
Now how it look? It go
Da da da da da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da da da, hey
Da da da da da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da da da, tell 'em it's beautiful music

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Word, you ain't heard the Pharcyde?
Burning disks for them high school car rides, like
Ooh-la-la-la, it's over
Traded in the Fugees for my cousin's Stankonia
He used to bone to Bone Thugs in his waterbed
Rockin' dreads listenin' to new Portishead
Wu-Tang to Midnight Marauders
Comin' out a system while I'm chillin' with his daughter
Fathers would freak out, "You listen to P-Funk?"
I listen to anything when she's sportin' them C cups
Jill Scott and Gil Scott-Heron
Was blarin' out of the dorm of the woman that I swear I was marryin'
It's them cold NYU winters
Laptop, brown socks, and no dinner
Drownin' out the sound that my stomach made
Napster, nigga I got everything
Yeah, Fruity Loops lookin' like Tetris
I want to be Pharrell so bad I got the haircut
I want to be Pharrell so bad I cut the drums out
And put my own verse on the end when it comes out
Lost my V-card to D-R-E
She liked Train so we broke up, listen to Big, grow up
Listened to J-Hova, I was a J-Hova, witness
Trying to make sense of the beautiful music

[Hook]

[Verse 3: GQ]
Yeah, hah, appreciate you sis
Yeah, I don't know much y'all, but I do know this
I've loved this since my cousin had a two-door whip
To Ms. Hill, I still get chills from The Sweetest Thing
To every angel still prayin' for Anita's wings
A fantasy Mariah singing with Old Dirty
I played Regulate back when Pac played Birdie
Hi there, Beautiful Idea, repeat it
To get by Mary and Meth was all I needed
Uh, I guess I got addicted at a young age
702 was playin' games in the subway
Mind playin' tricks on me, do I look confused?
I just want my day to go as good as Cube's
I'm all smiles though, I thank sis dearly
It's more than a art, I paint this clearly
I swear from this feeling get an extra lift
But thank Rap, she just blessed you with Beautiful Music

[Outro: GQ]
Yeah, she just blessed you with beautiful music
Sis, you got one girl, yeah, Ka$h
Somethin' that just feel good, you know?
Somethin' you ride to, wake up in the morning to, go to sleep to
It feels good, yeah
Right, like, Jamla yea
9th Wonder, idea of beautiful music
Sis, that be that beautiful music
Ka$h, beautiful music
GQ, beautiful[Intro: Pete Rock]
Let's go, let's go!
Jamla
Pete Rock!
Khrysis
How we're doing, son?

[Verse 1: Pete Rock]
It's a new day, new way
My hand's on the bottle
When your beat sound breakable
Something like bottles on the cobblestone
I carved my name and made it known
The boy wonder if it's Pete Rock, let's take it home!
For all my Gs who love real shit, you're not alone
A little world wide supporter set the tone
To stay in my zone and just try to...
The music hot, like pepper on the steak, kid!
Just like the nine mil' stripped you down naked
Funny style, nigga claim you're real, but you're fakers
Take a journey on my globe, trying to show you all seasons
Learn a thing or two for obvious reasons
Lay it down on the line, that part of my rhyme
You can die just my story and put it in your mind
A free spirit and complete design
Like I told you when the world was mine
The good times so defined
Fast break past the pill
No tricks in twenty tricks, it was time to bill

[Hook: Pete Rock]
And the motto is be inspired and not tired
And keep making beats and raps that cause fires
I'm not tripping, homie (aha)
I'm not tripping, homie
And the motto is be inspired and not tired
And keep making beats and raps that cause fires
Not tripping, homie (aha)
I'm not tripping homie

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
What if reality is faster than your third eye vision?
And our life is way more than what we see and we hearing?
When our heroes and our heroines all on heroine
Our inheritance is way more than the stuff they peddlin'
That American melatonin settles in
You fall asleep, only to wake up inside of hell's den
And that's connected to the kitchen if you pay attention
You never buy a wolf ticket to a snake convention
Meaning that if you open your eyes, you won't have to buy lies
But you couldn't pry em' open if you tried
That's why I pray!
Our worst enemies be dressing like the best of friends
And our killers be our next of kin
Yeah, I know I found the only way out of this mess we in
I'm done guessing, done stressing with the rest of them!
God is who I'm resting in, and I ain't sweating it!
It's living legends on this thing and they done let me in

[Hook]
And the motto is be inspired and not tired
And keep making beats and raps that crossfire

[Verse 3: Rapsody]
So ahead of my time, they're saying I'm 34
Momma she with the climb working on some awards
No celebrating tonight, till I own a Grammy or four
Diss to me what's the recipe, talent work at the courge
Put me in a force, make my own path, fuck a forbe
I'm a lane above anyone could probably touch commodores
Naturally high, most of you naturally lie, what for, huh?
Whenever in my corner, not everyone swear they sure, man
That I'm the best, or I'm close, or I got the gift to be
Duck, duck, goose I'm plucking off all my enemies!
Rolled up in a Honda now, I'm busting in the Acura
Yeah, I'm trying to be parking that Audia black backwards
Those are my list, and they're still talking about a list
Only thing left to talk about, everything else for shit! (oh my God!)
Bow down on my Benos, ain't gotta flaunt a ego
Niggas thinking they spitting, I'm 3000 below your ice cold
Reunited with illness, now cast of this real shit
And if you don't feel it is cause you saved it for your feelings!
I live life with no ceilings, I'm on top of my game
Spitting cane, codeine, say I'm dope, leave no remains!
Buried on one by one, and that was just for some fun today
They pray for forgiveness, my momma said that's the righteous way, yeah
That's the righteous way!

[Outro: Pete Rock]
Come on, come on
That's how we doing shit
Let's get it
Khrysis on the beat
Pete Rock
Ooo!
Yeah...[Verse 1: Rapsody]
My guard up nowadays, I don't trust nobody
See what you glorify, I could probly guess what you think about me
What you want from me? Cause you think I got it
Old friends I ain't seen in years be like "Don't forget about me"
That's some other pressure, enough to stress you out
How you gonna save a whole city and you ain't got your mama out?
Questions I ask myself, in my shoes how you pick and choose
To refuse the help when they never loved you neither
But you do it just to keep the peace cause jealousy is evil
Peace less frequently, you just wanna be a needle
In a haystack, hard to find
Protectin' sanity cause all we got is peace of mind
And if you did believe, don't get tainted by the shine
Who are you? The one that get love from that nigga that go "doo, doo, doo!"
Say I'm doing big things, reciting "Gimme the loot!"
But who are?

[Hook: Merna]
When the party's over and everyone is gone
When the world is over and we're all alone
Are you a believer? Are you a believer in my Lord?
Are you a believer? Are you a believer in my Lord?
Will you be around when it all comes down?
Will you be around when it all comes down?

[Verse 2: Rapsody]
My guard up nowadays, I don't trust nobody
What's true if niggas are lyin', you ask Bill Cosby
Allowin' you like Bill Cosby, I be on some shit
Drinking wasabi, watching [?] tryna learn to split
Cause family miss you but time's an issue when they 6
14, 7, 9, you look to 'em for innocence
Everybody's intent ain't the same
Dependin' on perspective, I could be the bad or the good Bane
Backstab you for not lettin' you ride the back of this train
On my coat cause everybody's infatuated with fame, man
I got a feeling that they really don't love me
I got a feeling I'm too dark so they think that I'm ugly
I got a feeling family think I've come into some money
So I've got a feeling I've got new cousins coming to find me
I got a feeling I'm bout to find out how precious time be
I find out everything about time and loyalty from a cosign
And I got a feeling y'all don't know where my mind is
Got a feeling there'll be less questions about how I been
Got a feeling change is comin' in climate and I don't mean rain
Or somethin' holdin' myself up to a promise
Lookin' at reflection tellin' "myself don't lose you
Don't move too quick, be cautious what you walking' into
Be ready all times, the levee might break
Chevy's 'll shake when they hear the shit that I gotta say"
Uh, stakes is high, my folks is poor
My people proud, they live through me
I love 'em when it's said and done I gotta expose my peeps
Cause it's real

[Hook][Verse 1]
Like, Like
Mountains and peaks, valleys I been through
The landlord telling me come through, rent due
Since you seem to have it all figured out
Next month while you coppin’ one, cop’ me a Benz too
They all think just because rhymes being laid
That niggas getting paid, when I struggle like you do
Put out more product and it's better than labels move
Meet the frustration that I never gave into, Nigga
Lauryn ain't crazy, just dont know what she been though
Complaining bout radio, my nigga, got no room
Cause niggas wit opinions dont support you on itunes
Listen, my soul mission was to rap and get paid too
Be someone that these little girls look up to
Now I see the game for what it is, a big chess move
Playing my cards all how they was dealt
I won't blessed with the money so my movement ain't felt
Nigga, smoke and mirrors, look in the mirror
Telling myself, "self ain't you glad your shit is imperial?”
I rule everything around me the C.R.E.A.M
Get your dollar, dollar bills yall this game is all a scheme
For control and being sold is a backwards kinda thing
They saying I'm the future so I’ll never waste my ring
And not answer my calling to be your daughter dream
My train of thought rapid, Im just blowing esteem
Putting fear in these rappers all proclaiming they king
If Maximus had a wife, then to Rome I’d be queen

[Hook]
Believe me, frontin’ niggas gimme heebie jeebies
Believe me, frontin’ niggas gimme heebie jeebies
Believe me, frontin’ niggas gimme heebie jeebies
Believe me, too many of you frontin for TV
Only real live niggas get respect easy
Believe me, frontin’ niggas gimme heebie jeebies
Believe me, frontin’ niggas gimme heebie jeebies

[Verse 2]
Miami beach, ain't seen no water yet
Heavy on mind like Avirex, I X’d
Out distractions, to be the rap rim
Goal that they tryna reach if you needing some evidence
You can ask 9th, address like residence
I'm nothing like these niggas we separate, I'm Evelyn
I spazz out like ex-wives to ballers
You wanna feel something? Then you know who to recommend
Jamla the squad in present tense, the team
Like Dream of '92 that they prayed to the reverend
To rebirth a nation, water distilled
So, when she break water spill, catch the flow like Jacqueline
Onassis, the curse and the gift
Canibus, take notes to you niggas that’s battling, nigga
Whats beef? Cattle and javelin
That shit ain't real nowadays, niggas just actin’ it
Zulu the real, the nation I rep
Keep medallions round my neck like the belt post accident
Kanye West, walk with Jesus my way
How you really all should pray if you knew what was happening
Yo, forget the name, they never can do
Twenty years still touched cuz the flow so passionate
Like prayers up to Jehovah when traveling
Protect me from rap foes and all the fake rap men
Believe me they souls is paper thin, for paper when
Heart ain't gold, I dont find you rich like Solomon
Rap three times nice like the number of wise men
Frontin’ niggas juke 'em every day like Heisman

[Hook][Verse 1: Wax]
You watching this, I don’t need your co-sign
Regardless I’ll be chilling up in the hammock in no time
Hawaian coast line, my girl’s so fine
Bikini blow-drying up on the clothes line
No mind on the bovine
I puked up the blue pill we were forced to eat
I’m intolerant to the lactose in the corporate teet
I’m starting not to want to participate or compete
Weren’t we meant to live a life more complete
You know there’s people in Peru right now that are hunter gatherers
And many recent studies have found that they’re happier than we are
I’m to rapping what the Kardashians are to PR
Preface my name with a D-R, huh
But I made a plan to kick the game in its smelly rectum
And I don’t deviate like a healthy septum
I’m the truth and it hurts fools
Yeah go type Wax in ya Youtube search tools
And buy some merch fools

[Verse 2: Rapsody]
Despite Sprite I thrist for mics
Like the look on racists' face if Kanye was Christ
It’s unbelievable, put fear in a poltergeist
He shaking twice, spit something that the Pope won’t like
I’m hoping Mike will understand my ultralight
Like a Sosa night run home to momma, damn she nice
Moonwalking, I’m just a talking and it’s really all light
10% dis or I can give you 90 tonight
Hurting for life, turn ‘em blue like I’m Walter White
Couldn’t face me with Skype, ‘til we cake like Tina and Ike
At your throat boy, fly like Elliott’s bike
Extraterrestrial flow, I’m so outta they sight
In the stars, where Kendrick threw bars, you was abroad
That G5 praying to God, I brought in the squad
And look how I bodied it like Playboy cards
Now they outta control like I said I'm the Queen of New York
It’s rap

[Verse 3: Emis Killa]
Today we are going out baby it’s wow
I bring you to the moon, say hi to the world
You purr and say “miao” and I’ll bring you the Chanel
I take five stars from the sky and I put them in this hotel
Brr, I’m more than cold, I’m Sub-Zero
The sun kisses beautiful people
And I burn like a vampire
Get undressed, enjoy the tropical sea
Which is the end of the world fuck 2012 off
If I would have fistfight and would take a lot
I’ll fall down but the on a red carpet
I’ve got so much swag that if we go around
People don’t know what I see
The panorama or my shoes
I’ve got a watch that shines so much that
I don’t even see what fucking time it is
I treat you as q queen, because I’m a king
If I were Christ, I would wear the gold edition crown of thorns

[Verse 4: Rittz]
I’m getting paid, I finally made it
But haters don’t’ want to see me win
Well I hate the word swag
I hate people that say "my G" and "fam"
I hate "I gotta listen", I’m what Hip Hop is missing
After this one they’ll consider me competition
For the record just because you rapping like you mad
Don't mean you snapping, you just sounding raspy
In Atlanta we don’t ride to that
I bet he get body bagged
I bet he wouldn’t win a boxing match
I’m quick on my feet, I could dodge a jab
You run up, you gunna run out of gas
Cause I'm on top and I'm rhymin'
And choppin' like I was in Karate class
Ya body get sawed in half
You're faker than a knock-off Prada bag, off my launching pad
Dunkin’ on ‘em like I’m Dominique
Reppin’ Strange my chain is stuntin’ on 'em, bada bing!
Off the chain I should probably party with Charlie Sheen
From the South but I wasn’t brought up like Paula Dean
And y’all are lame I’m ‘bout to X y’all out
I write whatever so fuck it if I let Nas down
Yeah, uh-yeah, get my album

[Verse 5: Jon Connor]
Yo the flow is timeless like a diamond
So when I’m rhyming, I’m mining
They said I was stuck in the rough
And you was just lucky to find it
You was foolish as Frankie Lymon
If you decided to try it or fight it
This is Andre the Giant vers' Daniel Bryan
Yes you want it hot, well allow me to change the climate
If the shoe was on the other foot you wouldn’t even know how to tie it
Somebody tell Rita Ora I sort got feelings for her
Got a crib out in Georgia we could raise a son and a daughter
Or we could go out to Florida where the weather is just as gorgeous
Baby I ain’t playing no games like I ran out of quarters
Hold up this is getting outta hand
‘Cause in a year I'mma be saying I’m not her man
Doin’ the U are not the father dance
‘Cause this is Michigan, proof feminine rappers be talking
Ain’t nobody genuine, I be killing it
They can’t touch him, everybody feeling it
But look I cleared out all y’all that got in the way
And y’all knew that I was ill, but now my doctor is Dre
Aftermath, AVM, Flint, Michigan[Hook]
But I ain’t really talkin bout much, I’m just bustin'
But I ain’t really talkin bout much, I’m just bustin'
But I ain’t really talkin bout much, I’m just bustin'
But I ain’t really talkin bout much, I’m just bustin'
But I ain’t really…

[Verse]
Mind of Malcolm X, I Belafonte like Andre rep dirty morning raps
I’m more for brothers that try to step to me
Heard it all so whatever they talk is less to me
Bless Umi, I shine my light on the world tonight
I’ve been beastin this evening, I got my tiger stripes
William SC, I’m livin a tiger’s life
Tryna get a piece of the pie, the cap messin eye in eye
Yea, might be a renegade, you been afraid
Show em Eminem, give no reason to speculate
Yea, they Wiggins, I'm More Parker
I’m more parts of Biggie Andre and Carter
Caught yo mind in my raps, the night clearer than holy water
I’m in fact and perceptions, I told'em I'm Margaret's daughter
She don’t give a damn
Bout who you are, just bout who I am
New sundown after sun god, born to advance
The acid rappin, now you rappers ain’t got a chance
MMMM Only Chance gave me a chance
Made something on my Lonely Thoughts when others thought that I can’t
I’m Gooden, I’m John Wooden a champion
I’m the M and OP, it’s about to ante up
That’s the anthem, that’s Auntie Em I'm far from Kansas
Wiggins I’m Mo Parker, they ain’t got the answers
I’m the truth boy, no swaying at that opinion
Emotional roller coaster, they Kanye at King Dominion
I’m the engine
Yea, rap got pride
Rap with a gift, rain danced on all odds
Better mend yo wives, they’ll never fuck with the squad
It’s Jamla if you forgot
That I’m the greatest before I rot
Could bear it if you went to Endor and took an Ewok
I’m the beast in the shadows, they whispering on the watch
(pa! pa!) that’s me taking aim at all of they spots
Dear pop, you sick of small pox, I know I love it
But I ain’t really talking bout much, I’m just busting
I ain’t really talking bout love, needing a husband
I’m too young, having fun
Ain’t tryna to stress about nothing
Give me a second
I’ll burn you, I’ll burn you for the record
They couldn't find a single drug in me like Eckerd
Just naturally a beast, show them suckas my record
We turn and had a burn with appetite like a pepper
Told em to Thank Her Now but most waited too long to rep it
Now they septic shock, realizing I’ve been separate
Second I ain’t my aim for everything they rejected
I made another weapon and niggas all wet pawns
Magna insides, resembling oceans
Cry me a river, canoed it without a paddle
Hold it out, carry me, I guess I got similar powers yea Ahh

Mind of Malcolm X, I Belafonte for Nelson rep dirty morning raps
Push up when you fall, don’t be scared of death
Get down like tyrannosaurus rex and expire the next
It’s nada when you been to Nagasaki
At a rap party in Pate on all pop of the posses yeah!
I’m Tarzan, two strands away from animal
Buck like antelope, all these rappers is Amber Rose
I ain’t heard nothing hot since Control dropped
They taking longer than Detox
They don’t wanna Vol-tron and so on
Pour on, feel my forearm, wear it like Luanne Rohan
Heart on sleeve, chief smile because we move on
Mistubishi Galant, dupont
Been a mutant since mama slipping coupons for croisannts and croutons
Do some damage, get at em like I’m a neutron, bouton
Pass on em, recycle em like a Mormon
I rained, it ain’t storming
I’m ignoring all that female rapping shit’s ignorant
Competing with every emcee, come step if you wanna see us rap

[Hook][Verse 1: Rapsody]
Need a big black four door body to push
Night time running through the streets, Reggie Bush
Car dashing through lights the color of kush
Run into my baby he could feel on my tush
Jedi flow better than the veterans know
Or average perceived like weed they never grow
Weak for weak tides need [?] coco
Compose rhymes with the signs of a J-hov
Step through it a new jet yeah I step in slow
West Snipes called, take over, double my flow
A diamond girl, Leslie, I shine brighter
Every magazine from XXL, Source, your writer
Lighter fluid, sparks, something similar to read
Robbin' every bit of attention that's been given to me
Thank 'em now if you please, Mayweather touch me never
Forever rap shit, y'all should treasure and see, Miss R.A.P
Flow a [?] no half rapper, fuck these niggas that acting
Ain't hanging with me, another plane I'm on
Con-Air, the baddest in the bunch where I belong, Jedi

[Hook: Heather Victoria]
Black girl Jedi
Feel the force no pressure, that said I
Keep it hot, we b-girls forever
Hip hop on top won't stop forever

[Verse 2: Rapsody]
J-Skywalker and I'm back in the flesh
Just when you thought it was safe to address
Your dream I came and demolished the scene
No room to intervene I got it padlocked with Jean
[?] trust, niggas ain't touching the smart
Apart from all life sees the most involved
In the red zone, one play away from my calls
Nicole, Richie from the records I sold shit
I'm far from that, maybe only 50 and hold
And ho they can't stomach me John and O
Well they ain't well, in feelings like braille
12 play ok I make them rotate, compel
No joke, Chapelle shit, they better know who I am
Black girl Jedi back with the force and the jam

[Hook]I've been advised to kill they vibe I ain't seen a size
Could fill my shoes, the path I walk hella wide and skewed
I think cool is being you, if you cool it's cool
I'm just a shark in a pool outgrowing all the rules they used to use to keep us in line
Like color class in school
The fastest food is the faster to sleeps cousin
My garden like Eden, I eat in produced by dozens
Patches wit Patrick spit peppers to pack palaces
Hit boards put numbers up like Malice’s
Pusha, push a brother I'm wheelin it, feel Paralysis
Walk in my shoes they never like E. in Dallas did
Naked truth died, the lies is taking over, shit
I spit Hova whips
See thru the tops pass the oval shit-
Presidential im wit dat Godliness
I'm gon' body this
You wanna test me?
Motherfucker come get bodied then
Cuz It's whatever

[Raheem]
I want this thing forever
But, everyday I (can’t get caught up)
I want that life forever
But I - can’t - get - caught - up

Verse II

Caught in judgements, love them so I let it go
Let um know the patience of Job is what I rode,
Thru bid Adieu, morning dew I couldn't let the load slow me
Four cloves, Im one of one, a rarity if you pairing, parenting wasn't done
Mama shoulda showed you what truth was
Spell it like new tux, black and white, plain to see Im the future
Show it like Hooters, my boosters still believe in me
So I have no time to get caught in your insecurities
Purity I'm Mercutio in my wittiness
More fuel for the fire, I ain't forgetting shit
Getting mine wit Krit Def Jam blocking
Don't matter much to me forever I stay rocking
Today we praying for Boston
Today we praying for Martin, both of them Martins march for um
Hope one day the world stop waring
Like autism, it's the system we assisting
Baby find some wisdom listen we gotta lift um
I'm too gifted to get caught up in the business
Handle my business till I am my own business
Smartness I be flexin like cartilage, can't get to deep caught in without rubbers
My brothers I love ya
But lotta of ya trouble
Why we had to part ways
Set you outside of the bubble
Can’t get caught up

Verse III

If my soul was to be accompanied
You werent my company
The one that could come and comfort me
Constantly I found myself caught up
Thinking of a future family, two sons a daughter
Water I shed many nights, thinking you might
Won't in the right direction of your life
I was right
Caught up in easy women
Heard you dabbled wit white sauce
Wouldn't of been in XXL or the Source had I stayed
It's just the grave reality
Thanks for valory, I ain't get caught out
The causality, just a dead soul
When happiness let go
Dipped in petro
Burning we learn less tho when our eyes closed
And we can't see thru forest
Stuck on fortune , The only reason you court them
Deport them
Report them to endorphines
They ain't doing jobs
Don't get caught if he don't love as hard
The heart[Hook]
Soirée of the masses
Toast to a beautiful life

Looking like its gon’ be a wonderful night

I celebrate forever everyday like I'm a star

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rapsody]
Raise a glass with the masses

Or you bought some new fashions
That you just need a reason to show your ass in
Celebrate for that
Celebrate cuz we beautiful and we black y'all
And if you got that new job
Celebrate cuz everyday living is hard
If your glass full of Palmer
Raise it high y'all for every single mama
And you over all the drama

[Hook]

Uh yeah, uh-huh

Rapsody

Figure of righteousness, y'all fillin' with crime
Ah man never mind, pay it attention
Rapsody is the best, not gonna mention
Who is the first MC to put it on the map?
(?) MC, Rapsody is on the track
Oh my goodness, not oh my God
The way she rap make the shit look hard

Off the top of the dome, and I'm rocking with home—

Get busy! This is no blunder
I'm rockin' with 9th Wonder
And the rest of Jam (?) if you wanna get busy follow me knock me off

Rapsody! Yeah!
One time for your mind and I'm out
(?)
Duck down, Smith & Wesson, (?) like yeah! Haha! Wooh!

The next generation of artists will determine what they will extend beyond
And just become musicCoconut oil, smooth slide through the vintage
Spot that we used to rock early in beginnings
My head used to spin then
A small crowd trippin’ on me, flippin’
Now the family expand in London, in Brixton
Smoking winstons how my lips burn to touch mics
95 grey nikes
Feel the re-release of beast, middle east
Ain't not saving um like day light
Arab? Muslims? All of um my cousins
Beauty brown skin might
Bomb on a nigga
Ain't nothing to do wit Qurans
Ramadan for the figures
Cheddar
Come night we all eat together
Kings and Queens accented with gold leather
Royal
Sippin Royal, smoke like two letters
Two Ls, swell
Blow up your spot, never
Underestimate the plot, my flock stick together
Shining on you daily, no matter crazy the weather
Glimmer like diamonds in chains
Pain a pleasure, in time, if it help me do better
Promised my mama, said “Imma get you whateva”
You just dream, 9th gon’ keep the swing
Opposite cream, we gon ride all black living better
I brought it back, like I told yall, forever
Culture, keep it focused you can’t sever my ties
I’m always gon ride Jamla till the death of me

[Raekwon]

Your face feel like suede, body is a 9.9
One more time, a diamond on display
Tiffany goddess in tennis wear
Staying a dentist, all that white on
Dro mixed with Guinness
We flew to Milan
Cherry Range Ro’ on the lawn
“Boo, where ya Qur’an?”
Its right here
Weird palaces in Mecca
We dressing, less filming she cryin’
All praises then extended both arms
Laid on the rug, thought about like life style
Hugged my lady harder, regarded
Regardless pardon Miss lets flow beyond
Palaces where blue water just flow
Coolin’ wit a bong
The ocean was talking to me
“Stay sucker free, be gone, love your enemies
Nights may seem you wrong”
Lights, camera, and wealth a song
I sat up for days before legend status
Now we be born

[Raekwon talking]
Its that
Its that that black sand talk right here
Word up, yo Raps what good
You know your brother got you
Damn, I hear that fly shit going on in the back
9th Wonder you remarkable nigga
You like a flooded ill magic marker
I’m ready to write graffiti nigga
Yo, pass that
What the fuck is that name of that bottle right there?
That shit is called “mnvkhjkbwkebrds,fba”
I dont what that sht is
That shit is crude nigga
That’s all[Produced by 9th Wonder]

[Hook]
I am one of the most consistent, respected in the business
My name make 'em shiver when you whisper it
I'm sleeped on
Times said it's my time and all the G's know
From the east to the west coast, Nas said I had a blessed flow
I'm sleeped on
Got it mixed like pico, barge in like Chico
Choke your chief now I'm the leader of all your people
I'm sleeped on
Give peace though, you think a piece of my teeth
As I tear through and feed your ego
Unhappy as CeeLo, for real

[Verse 1]
Cut the rules off
The new rules, ain't no rules, I'm the new law
These the keys to all the real bars
First you gotta learn control to play the game like P-4
This ain't Fifa, or Brazil real
Silly mind said beat it him or hers, no drill
But a tool I still use so often
It's like the hammer to put the nail in the coffin
No discrimination, even whites say awesome
With your Rick Ross need a doctor lookin' like Boston
No rules against flossin' I shine through the winters and monsoons
The fearful never know what I'm gon' do
Call it Luol Deng in here, that's a nine heat
A beast, a flower, bringin' slow singin' like 9 beats
That's a metaphor, I mean simile, but understand we ain't similar
I keep the letter for, it's never offensive
It's critical thinking why I feel so intensive
I could do it all night boy, never is endless
Keep my ear to the streets like rims is
Yea, uh, invincible like 4 arms
A slam dunk, it's a message to the forearms
You been forewarned, I'm a beast, uh
I keep J's like 41's on my feet son
You need 4 wands, magic in the forum
Or just pass it to and got him like oh I'm
So sick and this flow type ridiculous
I got 'em singin' like

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Ain't a choir but get acquired
Dress for success and defeat it in my attire
Stay lifted, I'm terrific kid like 4th graders
I want a love like Ruby and the mayor, yea
Every day out the bed rise, from Snow Hill to Bed-Stuy
L.A. and worldwide, I stay fly like bow-ties
What up Carlie, that's the hustle, hype don't mean a thing
You can ask Phillip and Russell
Third quarter I'm back
It's a fact, y'all in trouble, Seahawks cold comin' bruh
I'm a cold woman, bruh, I'm a cold woman
Yea, I been wiggin' and now it's Salt Lakes
You know a lotta sadness and a lotta hate
I got a better catalogue than the one with the H
Rapsody, easy exercise y'all bent outta shape
Lyrical flex on, welcome back the faculty
The ruler's back, ain't too many comin' after me

[Hook][Problem:]
Well problems the issue with beneficial judicial bars
No metaphor could ever explain this mental sores
Holes in the head, the critics players just the molly does
Nah it's that the devil, high as treble, riding in my truck
Staring at the driver side, hand rising up her thigh
Life's a bitch and a stitch that ho tell like the travel lodge
Dumb niggas try to change they life, for the better
So I'd rather the pull card again, but I'm too hot to sweat on these days

I get high,then I daze for days on in
Hope my son don't admire the stage that I'm in
But baby boy I'm on fire in the place that I'm fit
To take it, might make me complacent
Uh, shit changed and I need to face it
Finally realizing that problems no longer chasing
Move real far so my envious rate is raising
Got money now, so any heart I break I replace it with ease

Damn shit cold, when you come from where you judge bout how many pounds you sold
When you come from where you judge 'bout how many hoes you f*ck
If I succeed or if I fail and either one I'm f*cked and my mind
Cause I got daughters and shit
And the more I spend from them, the smarter they get
So they learn that something, shit
But I wonder who's teaching
All my bad shit I'm done with the preaching
Ya'll wanna hear 'bout the drugs, the money, sex and the guns
Or how I hate a hater and what I do with my tongue
Or how I'm with the faders and how my squad is the realest
You'd rather play my games, than hear 'bout my scrimmage
I dig it

[Rapsody verse]

180 pennicle, turn back
Back to blackin out on niggas rollin on Rosecran
LA LA land, A Kobe fan
Get booted I unrouted de plans
Pulled the wisdom out and now they ain't feeling advanced
Gino the first rounds, gotta um all feeling some down-
Ward spirals I'm checkin for vitals
Waves reaching tidals, I'm reaching for titles
Tribals I make marks like
Cartwright and Bill (build) off
Till the wheels off the ground and I'm flyer than the air force
Gravitate to me and hold me down like the airports
See thru the outside
Got love for my allies
Sun don’t set in the same position as when the sun rise
I'm two fives intended to be the best
So never stress the lame-os
Seeing thru the camouflage
Wyclef, Lauryn, and Pras
Score ain't even I had to leave um I know its odd
For it to be this hard and still make it
I'm forever chasing feel my heart
It's still racing from the steps I took to get this far
To get this car I been dreaming bout
Gotta drive myself farther now
Like Mrs. Carter made Hova, Jehovah Witness how
Door to door I knocked building a tower that theyll watch
Never complacent come place it into a higher spot
Higher seed, jack and the bean, no rapper'll top
These are the goals if you wanna have gold in yo stock

[Problem:]
I get high,then I daze for days on in
Hope my son don't admire the stage that I'm in
But baby boy I'm on fire in the place that I'm fit
To take it, might make me complacent

[Rapsody]
Uh, shit changed and I need to face it
Finally realizing my dreams are now awaken
Move real far so my envious rate is raising
Get love now, so any heart I break I replace it with ease[Produced by Thundercat & Sounwave; Additional production by Terrace Martin & Antydote]

[Intro]
(I'm with this)

[Hook: (Pete Rock)]
Complexion (two-step)
Complexion don't mean a thing (it's a Zulu love)
Complexion (two-step)
It all feels the same (it's a Zulu love)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Dark as the midnight hour or bright as the mornin' sun
Give a fuck about your complexion, I know what the Germans done
Sneak (dissin’)
Sneak me through the back window, I’m a good field nigga
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down
Even if master listenin', cover your ears, he 'bout to mention

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Dark as the midnight hour, I'm bright as the mornin' sun
Brown skinned, but your blue eyes tell me your mama can't run
Sneak (dissin')
Sneak me through the back window, I’m a good field nigga
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down
Even if master's listenin', I got the world's attention
So I'mma say somethin' that's vital and critical for survival
Of mankind, if he lyin', color should never rival
Beauty is what you make it, I used to be so mistaken
By different shades of faces
Then Whit told me, "A woman is woman, love the creation"
It all came from God then you was my confirmation
I came to where you reside
And looked around to see more sights for sore eyes
Let the Willie Lynch theory reverse a million times with...

[Hook]

[Interlude]
You like it, I love it (x8)
(Where the homegirl Rapsody at?
I need you to speak your mind real quick loved one!)

[Verse 3: Rapsody]
Let me talk my Stu Scott, ‘scuse me on my 2Pac
Keep your head up, when did you stop loving thy
Color of your skin, color of your eyes
That’s the real blues, baby, like you met Jay’s baby
You blew me away, you think more beauty in blue, green and grey
All my solemn men up north, 12 years a slave
12 years of age, thinkin’ my shade too dark
I love myself, I no longer need Cupid
Enforcin’ my dark side like a young George Lucas
Light don’t mean you smart, bein’ dark don’t make you stupid
And frame of mind for them bustas, ain’t talkin’ “Woohah!”
Need a paradox for the pair of doc's they tutored
Like two Todd's, L-L, you lose two times
If you don’t see you beautiful in your complexion
It ain’t complex to put it in context
Find the air beneath the kite, that’s the context
Yeah, baby, I’m conscious, ain’t no contest
If you like it, I love it, all your earth tones been blessed
Ain’t no stress, jigga boos wanna be
I ain’t talkin’ Jay, I ain’t talkin’ Bey
I’m talkin’ days we got school watchin’ movie screens
And spike your self esteem
The new James Bond gon’ be black as me
Black as brown, hazelnut, cinnamon, black tea
And it’s all beautiful to me
Call your brothers magnificent, call all the sisters queens
We all on the same team, blues and pirus, no colors ain’t a thing

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
Barefoot babies with no cares
Teenage gun toters that don’t play fair, should I get out the car?
I don’t see Compton, I see something much worse
The land of the landmines, the hell that’s on earth[Verse 1: Rapsody]
Dark nights been cold like night veins
Serve niggas chills, I'm ill like Mike Caine
Express and I stress the best, I'm insane
To these bitches like Miranda, I'm lyrically Bruce Wayne
Pain I felt it and belted it out in sorrow
Broke days, way too embarrassed to ask to borrow
A dollar for a quarter a gallon of gas tomorrow
Struggles by the car load had me lower than Carlos
Borders we sorta ignore 'em like fuck a lock yo
No plan drawn still stone cold, a Picasso
Nothing quite impossible, something similar to Pac though
Young poet, we know it, sow it so it'll grow blow
Where the wind take me, money'll never make me
No matter where I go, so money'll never break me
Though I been broke like pieces of soap pasted
To cleanse my soul bands like grams we raising
Reaching for better, it's whatever I'm Kevin Bacon
X men out that want none a part of my making why
Bane ain't a match for this emcee
And Dark Knight bat wings need a M3
All y'all drool for Ra's al Ghul protégé
I've been cold as Jay on "3 Kings" nigga get schooled
I am the, 5'3" Morgan free-flow genius
Underground killer like Bane whole team is
They couldn't cop me now they stuck underneath me
I took a leap of faith and I climbed up easy
Rap-so-deezy and Eric Jones, I Gotham City
I save ya all from the bad rappers in ya city
And let you take a couple jewels like the cat lady
Dark Knights rise again Jamla we back baby
Yea
I say Dark Knights rise again Jamla we back baby
It's so quick to flip and crown a next king
Trip like crips do the blues make us swing
[Low as the flow where chariots rider wings?]
I decoded the message arrested by modern bling
[?] lives that never use knives to bring
Themselves up a notch only took a stab at a dream
Coliseums, used to pray to him, the Elohim
Witnessed the door to door and I guarded it like Hakeem
The Idi Amin of all these idiots mean I know
Toe to toe go with the best that they throw in the ring seen
Lot of despair, pair me with none of them things, two left
Feets only dance to the beats with B's we rep
Honesty, my history Cherokee and it's African
Deep blue cinnamon, every bit of the black in him
Embrace heritage, capitalize like acronyms
We higher seed, no need to deplete it like the Vatican
And Benedict ourself, deplenish all our wealth

[Bridge (repeat until fade): Rapsody]
Never blame a man for misfortune, do it yourself

[Verse 2: Wale]
Ain't rocked a 9th beat in a minute
I ain't even with niggas
You slight breeze, I'm wife beaters in winter
I'm a product of Reaganomics where the law is a greater problem
Where the niggas is spraying something and they got 'em
Word to Robin, that's Gotham
That was fiction but I'm talking about the district
Where business is booming for bird flippers and morticians
And I understand the plight of Bane
Except we using other drugs just to fight the pain
It's coming apart, I'm hoping to God you niggas ain't playing
Cause I'm more Patrick Bateman and y'all Bruce Wayne
And I do my thing really
Folarin spit pepper, young veteran
You niggas lack season like a torn ACL-a
Level headed, I put this wit in yo lady belly
And I bet my digits 'bout as thick as Fat Belly Bella
I'm like the new fella meets (Goodfella)
Good guy turned heel do the crude business
Manute length is a list of niggas that may envy
But I eat danger for lunch, breakfast, and plate empty
And I leave the place with some choice ladies to fellate with me
And I pull hoes like cellos strings, nigga hear my symphony
Of the Opus Mr. Holland ain't got nothing on
Hollerin' at these hollow heads, we both shallow but I am raw
Fly as fuck, who the fuck is y'all to compare me to them peoples
Niggas questioning they outfit like Jim Carrey on the sequel, get me[Hook]
I wanna meet Jay and just play a rhyme for him
I see him spitting Heineken, like girl rhyme again
Saying your inspiring, to Blue Ivy and them
Take it back like hockey jerseys, guess jeans
And butter timbs

[Verse 1: Rapsody]
Jehovah’s Witness, I never had a Christmas
Never really missed it
Toys on a wish list
Papa worked night shift to make sure my life lit
Like them trees with them angel wings and some nice gifts
Not a single birthday party wit a cake lit
Never had to blow out candles for my wishes
Told anything that I dreamed I could be if
I worked at it, had to put the drive into automatic
Memories of paramedics up at the crib late
Im fearing her life, got me praying for Allstate
Put some good hands on her, I need for always
And beyond being young, she gotta live to see old age
Hard watching mama sick, It felt like some cold days
I wonder if she thought of paradise like Coldplay
I know what cross your mind when your health ain't all great
Fear of losing life, I know the feeling too well, weight
Heavy on mind, I was sick summers, losing weight
Had to be a patient patient, praying to mediate
Escape in the music take me far as them everglades
Red accord riding, memorizing that J-A-Y hyphen
Thinking of my life in them future days
All my dreams on my mind looping on replay, like

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rapsody]
When I weighed 110, ten, summer young, thin
When I played ball, I always played Jay before the gym
Hustle music for the hustlers, we both rimmed rocks
His in tires, mine retired, double-deuce on slot
Twenty-two 2’s, I was 22 in jersey
Tri-state how New York City connected with my jersey
Ya girl game tight, you can say im Jay worthy
Thats double entendre flow, I wonder if you heard me?
Got diamonds in my hands, we both throwing the rocks [rocs] up
Its all nets, like the team, yo shouts to Brooklyn
My sister call me Marcy, this a Marcy project
Marcy projects influence, holding Hov on the steps
On the sets of big dreams, in Time Square, New York
Rocking BB Kings, wit my team, we feeling the force
Snap back to reality, Im back in accords
Snap back to reality, recording on boards
Its like

[Hook][Hook: Merna]
Fuck what them say, I don't need it
Them wanna build you today just to tear you down
I don't let them preach, and I don't believe it
See there's no weight to they words, they can't wear me down
I don't need it

[Verse 1]
I woke up satisfied
I'll never let your negativity kill my vibe
I know everybody's dreams don't survive
That's the difference between me and them in this life
Everybody talk a lot
I remember not to follow what they talk about
I know I'm the illest out, sheep gon' be sheep
So I know you'll come around in time
They always do, they don't ever let you down
Talking about everything you need except the crown
Your gift and your passion to them don't ever count
'Til your name and life and money overflowing in accounts
All you bitches look like clowns

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
"Yo, let me apologize for the other types that made you feel like you could ever steal my light
Joy always come in the morning no matter what the night do
Might not be today, but one day they gon' understand you"
I don't need that drama, I don't need to give you light
I was taught: don't give energy to those you don't like
I don't need to go major, made it this far without paper
I don't need that cover either, I don't need none of your favors
Told my mama "We gon' make it", I don't need your funds
I don't need to get naked, I just need to have some fun
I don't need your emo beats, all I want is soul and funk
I don't need your validation, hell, I already done won

[Bridge: Merna]
It's here in your own star
Once you wake up and realize who you are
'Til we know, we don't need it
I don't need it

[Verse 3]
My confidence out the roof
Aquarius in me told me opinions ain't truth
This amusement wasn't amusement for you
When it's showtime I'm on like Kobe Bryant in his youth
I'm Birdman, I'm Birdman, I'm Birdman
My play is not to make you opinions my burden
Whoo! Uh, Damn, Michael Keaton
Shoot the nose to spite the face, I ain't even
Mama say there's more success in succeeding
My complexion in the black this evening
That's the prop that I'm teaching business
Santa Clause to Jehova's Witness
Ain't believe, now they want forgiveness

[Hook][Produced by Khrysis]

[Verse 1]
Billie Holiday, I sing your blues
Bet your life against me and I swear to God you’ll lose it
Muthafuck the cops we still singin’ for St. Louis
Super easy flow, shit I could do it while I’m snoozin’
Trippin’ off the dope again like Pookie out of rehab
Talkin’ money you ain’t got, steady makin’ me laugh
Call it funny paper like a Sunday praisin’ Jesus
The world goin’ apes again, I swear we need a Caesar
I told him I ain’t single he still ask me can I see ya
I told him he ain’t too smart why them other ladies D ya
Your scorin’ inefficient, I’m just talkin’ business
Numbers never lie when you been shootin’ high percentage

[Hook (x2)]
Go ‘head (go ‘head), go ‘head (go ‘head)
Go ‘head (go ‘head), go ‘head (go ‘head)
Go call the cops on us I’mma go start some craziness drama
Tryna be patient Obama don’t make ‘em bring out them llamas
Go ‘head

[Verse 2]
It’s intense when your color this immense
Throwing shade so much a nigga never needed tent
Either way it’s darker, I save myself a couple cents
I’m smarter than the average, we just talkin’ bout the rent
Home of the free uh, livin’ in America
Cold, cold world I guess we all is Nancy Kerrigan
Thought they’d let you skate through, or run like Marion
Let you reach your goal and then they call you ol’ arrogant
Jordan ‘85 and shit, break a foot in all they asses
Book sense, common sense, that’s two separate kind of classes
I’m just in another space, you just on the same planet
Range shootin’ out at things, I ain’t talkin’ the Atlantic
Call me Plymouth Rock baby, no thanks given though
Only thing I’m thinkin’ now is how to flip another flow
I ain’t talkin’ commercials though, I know I’m talkin’ progressive
So over your heads my homie said count your blessings up
It’s about ten I see and I ain’t speakin’ Memphis
Talkin’ bout patience, gifts, friendship bein’ relentless
Boy I got some wings and I ain’t speakin’ on Bentleys
But if I ever get one you know I’m whippin’ on Indie
500, hunnid, I tell you mu’suckas I’m comin’
Whether man or you woman, boy I’m a beast if you frontin’
Bring it back to your front and
Bring it back to your front and
Bring it back, rewind, it’s nuthin’ to shine, so I

[Hook]
