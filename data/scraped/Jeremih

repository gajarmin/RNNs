[Intro]
This one goes out to all sides world wide
Let that play ass nigga Thumpy be your guide
As we go on a ride where playa hatin' killers and hood niggas thrive
And lame mah'fuckers can barely survive

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
Catch me rollin' through the city
Ridin' with the top off
Man, my whip so big when you in it
Fuck around and get lost
Told my bitch to let her hair down
What this shit costs?
Tell me, baby, if you 'bout that life right now
I hope it ain't talk, no

[Pre-Hook: Jeremih]
I can put you in the Mile High Club, what's up? Let's take a trip
Have you ever read "The World Is Yours" on a blimp?

[Bridge: Jeremih]
Tell her be free, baby spread your wings
Got your legs in the sky like a plane
Let me guide that, I'm the pilot
Can't nobody see you, 30 thousand feet
On your knees in them Prada's
Makin' freaky shit come up out her

[Hook: Jeremih]
Get high baby roll one, cloud nine 'bout to go up
Lovin' the feelin' the turbulence get when we turn up
When we land we can roll out
Show you somethin' you ain't know about
Tonight we be takin' off flight with a camera to show out

[Verse 2: Jeremih]
I got you in the air, your body in the air
How it feel up here?
You can scream as loud as you want, loud as you can
And ain't nobody gonna hear
Would you like it better
If I hit the west coast?
Tell me, if you 'bout that life right now
I hope it ain't talk

[Pre-Hook: Jeremih]
I can put you in the Mile High Club, what's up? Let's take a trip
Have you ever read "The World Is Yours" on a blimp?

[Bridge: Jeremih]
Tell her be free, baby spread your wings
Got your legs in the sky like a plane
Let me guide that, I'm the pilot
Can't nobody see you, 30 thousand feet
On your knees in them Prada's
Makin' freaky shit come up out her

[Hook: Jeremih]
Get high baby roll one, cloud nine 'bout to go up
Lovin' the feelin' the turbulence get when we turn up
When we land we can roll out
Show you somethin' you ain't know about
Tonight we be takin' off flight with a camera to show out

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Cole World, I got it, I got it, I got it, listen
You need a nigga that's gon' come over and dig you out
You need a nigga that you know is not gon' run his mouth
You need a nigga when he done probably gon' put you out
You need a nigga that's gon' put it in your mouth
Dick so big it's like a foot is in yo' mouth
And y'ain't babysitting, but my kids all on yo' couch
And oh, you nasty, oh, oh, you nasty
Both graduated so fuck keepin' it classy
Look, they love me in the Chi like MJ
They love me in the Chi like Oprah
No nigga could block, not even Dikembe
Compared to Cole, boy, you're softer than a sofa
And so far my new shit's so fire, nigga, check my profile
Who you know make waves in the low tide?
Deebo'ed yo' bitch, now she both ours
Nigga, little brown liquor in my liver
Pretty brown thang in my bed
Been a long time since I had to ask for head
So god damn don't make me beg
But I will if I need to cuh for real, girl, I need you
I could put you on a flight, we could take off tonight
If you scared of heights, shit I got a pill I could feed you, Cole

[Pre-Hook: Jeremih]
I can put you in the Mile High Club, what's up? Let's take a trip
Have you ever read "The World Is Yours" on a blimp?[Intro: Jeremih & Chance The Rapper]
I don't wanna be you, I just wanna be me
I don't wanna be cool, I just wanna be me
You don't wanna be cool, you just wanna be me
I don't wanna be cool, I don't wanna be cool, I don't wanna be cool
I don't wanna be cool, I don't like being cool
I ain't trying to be cool, what's it like being cool?
I just can't stay cool, I don't wanna be cool
I don't want you to be me, you should just be you
You just wanna be me!
You just wanna be me!

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Okay, I grew up without a chauffeur
Man, I'm talking straight out the dirt and sulfur
Only birds in my city is vultures
I mean back before I could afford a faux fur
I was off in that debt, me and my mama
Hand-me-downs was the only time I got designer man
Only class I'm passing is English and Math
I don't know, maybe because they both got commas
Maybe because my older bro was on the honor roll
And the other one was always up in front of the honor
So I'm in the middle like the line in the divide signs
Spending all my money on girls and Sean John
Way before anybody called me Sean Don
I was dropping fifties man to look like 50
Rocking pink Polo's, shit ain't even fit me
Looking for the inspiration that's already in me
All the confidence I was trying to buy myself
If you don't like me, fuck it, I'll be by myself
Spend all this time for you to say I'm fine
I really should have spent it trying to find myself

[Bridge: Jeremih & Chance The Rapper]
It's cool with just me
I'm cool being me
I don't wanna be cool
I ain't trying to be cool
I just can't stay cool
Whats it like being cool?
I don't wanna be cool
I don't wanna be cool
I don't want you to be me
You just should be you

[Verse 2: Kyle]
Is being cool that cool? (Really?)
Is being a tool that big of a tool? (Is it?)
It doesn't matter if a nigga is wearing Supreme
If a cool guy shits his shit's still gonna stink
If a cool guy's cool in the middle of the forest
Man nobody fucking cares
So why don't you just be the you that you know you are
You know, when nobody else is there?
You'll be aware, it's easy, and it's so important
Being cool shouldn't cost a fortune
Baby got her jeans from Goodwill
But I bet that ass look good still
Okay let's remember that shopping at Payless
It just means that you pay less, it don't make you bae-less
If you don't get re-tweets, it don't mean you say less, okay?
So I'mma post this shitty-ass selfie on IG
And I don't care if anybody likes it or likes me, it's cool

[Outro]
I don't wanna be cool
I ain't trying to be cool
I just can't stay cool
Whats it like being cool?
I don't wanna be cool
I don't wanna be cool
I don't want you to be me
You just should be you[Intro]

Natalie La Rose

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I wanna rock with somebody
I wanna take shots with somebody
I wanna leave with somebody
And we ain't gonna tell nobody, we ain't gonna tell nobody

[Verse 1: Natalie La Rose]
Walk in, everybody knows what's good
But some gonna hate, what's new?
We just do our thing, no time to waste
Always play it cool

[Pre-Chorus: Natalie La Rose (Jeremih)]
And at the end of the night when the lights go out
Will we turn down? Oh no we won't
(We ain't never turnin' down, we ain't never turnin' down)
And when they try to make us leave
We turn and say we never going home
(And you know just what I wanna do)

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I wanna rock with somebody
I wanna take shots with somebody
I wanna leave with somebody
And we ain't gotta tell nobody, we ain't gotta tell nobody

[Verse 2: Natalie La Rose]
Walk in, everybody know what's good
We're our only plug
Bring us everything we think we need
Tonight is goin' up

[Pre-Chorus: Natalie La Rose (Jeremih)]
And at the end of the night when the lights go out
Will we turn down? Oh no we won't

And when they try to make us leave
We turn and say we never going home

I wanna rock with somebody
I wanna take shots with somebody

[Pre-Chorus: Natalie La Rose (Jeremih)]
And at the end of the night when the lights go out
Will we turn down? Oh no we won't

And when they try to make us leave
We turn and say we never going home
(And you know just what I wanna do)

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I wanna rock with somebody
I wanna take shots with somebody
I wanna leave with somebody
And we ain't gotta tell nobody, we ain't gotta tell nobody[Hook: Jeremih]
She don't know about real niggas, she don't know no boss
She don't know about foreign cars, she don't what that cost
She don't know about love, she don't know what that is
She don't know about riding round and spending it like this
Fuck with a nigga like me, wanna fuck with a nigga like me
Now she wanna fuck
Fuck with a nigga like me, wanna fuck with a nigga like me
Hit the club with a nigga like me
Do drugs with a nigga like me
Fall in love with a nigga like me
And never love another nig, never love another nigga like me
(Meeee, meeee)

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Have you ever met a Chi town nigga?
Girl I heard you need a go-getter
You ain't never meet a rapper
With the swag of a savage and a dope dealer
I'm the realest nigga that you see
I know you tired of them broke niggas
Heard he bought you a bag for a G
Why you fuckin' with them broke niggas?
Gingerale  in a fifth of liquor
Where you going girl I'm going with ya
Ride with me cause I'm number one
Two bitches, Malcolm in the middle
Fly to Vegas, bet life
Legs in the air, call it jet life
Shawty give me top with the neck like
Shit gave me life, I can't get right, I can't get right

[Verse 2: Jeremih]
Got you jacuzzi water on a hundred
Got your tempo on a hundred, let it bubble up
Need a bad bitch, tryna be a bad girl
You know I'm tryna trouble up
Buy everything she wants two times, baby double up
Say she need more niggas out here like me
Cause there's not enough

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Durk]
You ain't never been in my town nigga
A good place to go but the murder rate's so ridiculous
Fell in love with some R&B bitch
And I know that it's good for the fame and the image
Shawty gave me head like a penny
But she should go-go
Ain't really been in love in a minute
It won't hurt if no one know about me
Fuck a bag off
No make up you look better with your mask off
Rich nigga wanna buzz, like to brag y'all
But a nigga like me, ain't no nigga like me
I'm a Boss, Hugo
Rich nigga since birth, you know
You my bitch don't get mad, Cujo
Nigga like me
I'm that nigga, nigga
Gettin' money since a little nigga
Shawty thinks she the shit, but she could be a little thicker
Fuck on my name and a little liquor
I got em pissed, I'm the shit nigga
So why do they hate? I gotta get cake
These niggas so fake, so stay out my way
Ain't too many niggas like me

[Hook][Intro: Jeremih]
She is the freak of the week, now everybody
See, she is the freak of the week

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
Last night I had two bitches

Something sexy 'bout them pretty keep it hood bitches
They just seem to show me what I'm feeling
Let your body see, I said she freakin' to me

Now everybody see, she is the freak of the week
You got your body speaking to me

[Verse 2: Krept]
Step, step, step to the party like an OG

And she got moves like bad gyal RiRi
Said he hit it right, go H·A·M when he tap that
You last ten seconds, man, you're a Snapchat
Hit it in a car, hit it in a house
Hit it in a bath, hit it on a couch
Meet me outside, jump in the ride
If she ain't mine then she probably with Kone (holla at me)

[Verse 3: Konan]
Say you got a man, you don't seem sure
Showing off your skin, I wanna see more
We can take a little detour
Have you ever ate McDonalds on a G4?
You got your keys to my beep beep
They ain't doing it right, come and see me
I can tell that you're freaky
And I know you ain't shy like Chief Keef
I can see you got your eye on it
Big batty girl, come whine on it
Big titty girl, where your arse at?
She can't believe that I asked that

[Hook: Jeremih]

I don't want no drama
I just wanna be your diamond, babe
Guaranteed  to be a problem
Every time I get around you, babe
I just want you to need me
You might really wanna try me, babe
All I know I want a rider
All I know I want a rider, babe
You know that you need a rider
You know that you need a rider, babe
You know that you need a rider
You know that you need a rider, babe, ah yeah...

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, I just wanna be ya rider, you should pull up in that Spyder
You should let me hit the mic, and I ain't talking about the fighter
Get it lit without a lighter, let's pull an all-nighter
Tell me-tell me what you need, got the weed
I'm a bad little bitch and I never indict her
Get locked, I'mma write ya, you on the road? I'mma Skype ya
I don't wanna hype ya, but you a lucky nigga if my mean ass like ya
You ain't never have a bitch understand you
Most of them wanna use you when they ran through
I just wanna be somebody that can add to
Your wife, be a friend, be a teacher and a fan too
I just wanna listen, when you leave I say "damn, I fucking miss him"
I just wanna be your vixen
Give you something real wet to put your lips in
I wanna be the only one that can check you, and still respect you
Cause it's you I would change for, you always make sure

[Hook: Jeremih]
I just wanna be your favorite
I just wanna be your favorite
I just wanna be your favorite
I just wanna be your favorite
Won't you let me be your favorite?

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Ayo, I just wanna be your first go to
Do you like a real one supposed to, livin' bi-coastal
Scoop me in the truck, late night, on a humble
Meet me out in Queens where the city want a sundown
You could put your gun down, you could have fun now
You could tell you niggas that you won now, one down
Run through the clubs with the baddest
Bitches is the maddest, nothin' else matters
And they say Birkin where the bag is
Gotta lot of bags, but we never got baggage
Winter Wonderland on my hands, call me Alice, balance
I'mma have you coming in my palace
London, Tokyo, Paris, let me update your status
Cause it's you I would change for, you always make sure

[Hook: Jeremih]
I just wanna be your favorite
I just wanna be your favorite
I just wanna be your favorite
I just wanna be your favorite
Won't you let me be your favorite?

[Outro: Nicki Minaj (Jeremih)]
You should already know
You should already know
You should already know

(You know that you need a rider
You know that you need a rider, babe
You know that you need a rider
You know that you need a rider, babe, ayy

You should already know, you should already know
(I just wanna be your favorite)
You should already know, you should already know
(Won't you let me be your favorite?
Won't you let me be your favorite?)[Hook: Jeremih & (Nicki Minaj)]
Want some more, want some more
Even though a nigga been getting to it, want-want-want some more
(Still want some more) Want some more, want some more
Every time I end up getting it, want-want-want-want some more
(When they start talking crazy that's when I know that they) want some more
(I know that I'm getting it, but fuck it cause I) Want some more
(When they start talking crazy that's when I know that they) Want some more
Every time I end up getting it, want-want-want-want some more

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I'm in this bitch, I'm getting money
One minute they hate me, then they love me
Ain't got nothing for me, these dudes is funny
That's why, I'm throwing shade, like it's sunny
Who had Eminem on the first album?
Who had Kanye saying, "She a problem"?
Who the fuck came in the game, made her own column?
Who made Lil Wayne, give 'em five million?
Why the fuck I gotta say it? Oh, you niggas don't know it yet?
Football touchdown, on the Boeing jet
You my son, but I'm just not showing yet
Wrist icy, but it ain't snowing yet
You can tell I'm the illest, cause my dividend is the biggest
Bitches ain't sitting with us, all my niggas in Margielas (Oh!)
Is pigs flying? Is these bitches trying me?
They think it's sweet? Oh, these bitches got diabetes
You seen that list? It was me, Baby, Jay-Z and Diddy

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
(Yo, yo)
I'm in this bitch, I'm high-saditty
I popped a Perc and I said, "thank you"
I'm popping tags everyday, it look like my B'Day
These bitches suck, so I nickname these bitches BJ
They want that union, they want that D-Wade
I tell a ho, "Just be happy they getting leeway"
My name Barbie, bitch (my name Barbie, bitch)
Alexander made me Queen, I'm pulling up with the King
I'm late to my own party, bitch
Want it, I get it, I don't be wanting for nothing
I mean, I do what I do and it must be counting for something
I don't be jumping from topic to topic, stay in my pocket
I got your rent in my pocket, so can I pay you to pop it?
Cash money, getting six albums,no bitch niggas on a bitch album
You niggas apologize when a nigga diss you? That's a big problem

Tonight, we're gonna get badder (Badder)
You're gonna get wetter (Wetter)
We're gonna take our time
Not tomorrow, no, tonight, we'll love
(Fucking like we in love, we be fucking like we in love)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Yeah, she got that shit that make you kill a nigga
Crack that last bottle, I'll kill it with you
Pour my feelings out and spill it with you
That's a no-no, but what he don't know
Never hurt him, so just desert him
I find it hard to believe that he ain't pullin' your weave
No, I'm kiddin', I'm knowin' my dick is different
He kept his distance, I kept comin' over and stayed persistent
You bitin' your lips, toes twitching and she crinching
Steamin' up the bathroom 'til we left it a sauna
I beat it up and now you usin' my tee as pajamas
Your friends tried to warn you about me, even your mama
But you said you'd deal with the consequence, even if it was karma
But how can I complain when you give me insane brain?
Like you graduated with honors, you probably hate that I'm honest
But, fuck it, I'm going all out
You should too, good things don't last forever, I thought you knew

[Hook: Jeremih]
Tonight, we're gonna get badder (Badder)
You're gonna get wetter (Wetter)
We're gonna take our time
Not tomorrow, no, tonight, we'll love
(Fucking like we in love, we be fucking like we in love)

[Bridge: Jeremih]
Now don't you no worry about that
Whatever you want, I'm on that
So don't hesitate, girl, when you lonely
Baby, don't worry, we know that I got you

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Now here we go again, from the bed to the floor again
I hear your phone on vibrate and I know it's him
But that's what happens when that kitty's in the lion's den
You start lying and changing places
You might've been, I might've been too aggressive
But it was far from desperate
I mean, the swag I got, just know it's half the effort
They tryin' to toot my horn
But, shit, I sworn that I swarmed up in it, stamped and fingerprint it
Left the coupe tinted when you played the passenger
Don't be passing up 'til we finish
What we started, you with it? I'm with it
Then lay your seat way back like it was vintage
While I hit the highway and slowly puff on this spinach
Camouflage emotions got your feelings wide open
I'm hoping you come to grips
At least before you provoke 'em to trip
But that's inevitable, and if I put you on a pedestal
That means I'm fuckin' you on a chair

[Hook: Jeremih]
Tonight, we're gonna get badder (Badder)
You're gonna get wetter (Wetter)
We're gonna take our time
Not tomorrow, no, tonight, we'll love
(Fucking like we in love, we be fucking like we in love)

[Bridge: Jeremih]
Now don't you no worry about that
Whatever you want, I'm on that
So don't hesitate, girl, when you lonely
Baby, don't worry, we know that I got you

[Verse 3: Jeremih]
Now that I got you about they thinking out you
I want to stop and I don't want you to stop that
Ow, we in a phase, oh, I can't wait
Cause waters don't label you, oh, no, no
I'm from, came from the bottom, so just get on top of that
How about with the top back with your top back?
Take that off, uh, ooh, ooh, break that off more, more

[Hook: Jeremih]
Tonight, we're gonna get badder (Badder)
You're gonna get wetter (Wetter)
We're gonna take our time
Not tomorrow, no, tonight, we'll love
(Fucking like we in love, we be fucking like we in love)[Intro:50 cent]
I'mma be honest with you, I expect you to like me
I mean what is there not to like, I'm confident
I got a great sense of humor, I'm fun
I'm the kind of person you have fun with
(chuckles)

[Hook: Jeremih]
If it look this good
I wonder how it taste
Baby if I touch your body
Hear you scream my name
Would you whisper to me "It's yours"
Girl you smell so gentle and pure
You control my senses
Baby ooohhh my senses

[Verse 1: 50 cent]
It's like everything's good
When I touch and you touch (one)
It smells like heaven
Way better than a tulip (two)
Your love let me taste it
Come here let me taste it (three)
Time is of the essence
Baby don't you waste it
I tell you what I'm thinking
You listen to my thoughts (four)
So you could see my vision
Then you'll never get lost (five)
If you follow my lead
Girl I'll be what you need
I put my trust in you now
Put your trust in me

[Hook: Jeremih]

[Verse 2: 50 cent]
I'll be a true friend
Someone to believe in
I'll give you freedom
Unconditional meaning
If tonight is her night
It's her night
Just get back to me tomorrow, alright?
I'm not into cuffing
I'm not into fronting
I'm into getting paid
But blowing paper
I be stunting
See to me its nothing
Let's get into something
Should I pick you up or meet you at the tele girlfriend

[Jeremih]
Would you whisper to me it's yours
Girl you smell so gentle and pure
You control my senses

[Hook:Jeremih]

Touch....
See....
Smell....
Hear....
Taste....[Verse 1]
Let me be your stimulation
I could be your occupation
Work you like a 9 to 5
Plus put in that over time
Careful with what you do to me
Cause everything I do to you
I hope that you'll do for me
And when the light's low
Pop a bottle of that goose please
Twist off a couple loose leaves
(Seduce me)
Girl welcome to my bed
Come here
You thought it would be easy (sy-sy-sy)

[Hook]
(Ow)
Sexy I should get to know
Been thinking lately girl we can get more physical
Won't you call 773, 779 love, oh
Those pantie drawers is all I need
Falling off of your body
Won't you call 773, 779 love, oh

[Verse 2]
Better now and even later
Let me be your innovator
Feels alright when I'm right with you
They lyin' if you not the truth
Miss co-star, let's proceed
You got that fire, that third degree
Yo, this is how's supposed to be
And when the light's low
Pop bottle with a goose please
Twist off a couple loose sleeves
(Seduce me)
And welcome to my bed
Baby won't you come here
Thought it would be easy

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Okay girl I'm not him put it down, down
Okay girl I'm not him put it down, down
Okay girl I'm not him put it down, down
Cause I know in you's a little freak let it out, out

[Hook][Hook: Velous]
I can never pass up, lay it down
Long backstrokes in the middle of your ocean
I’mma need that ass up, face down
If I get in, then I just might drown
Slippin’ and Slidin’
Slippin' and Slidin'
I could swim in it all night and
Slippin’ and Slidin’ it in
I just slip in then I slide in
I just slip in then I slide in

[Verse 1 : Tyga]
Dumb bitch, do your dumb dance
Like Juicy J said “They ain’t usin’ hands”
It’s halftime, got hella bands
Even white girls with spray tans
Yeah, let me see it
Yeah, I like it when you bend over bitch
For a real nigga, I’m a big tipper
You ain’t gotta be a stripper
I politic and she with it
I ain’t trippin’ to hit it
Titties, hundreds and fifties
Turning up in your city
Later she leaving with me
Now you see me, I'm...

[Hook]

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
Pussy juice on my clothes, bitch
Don’t fall in that hole
Fergy got that pussy thuggin’
Man I’m Garfield on these hoes
I got that pussy talking like meow meow meow
Then bust that pussy open like (pow pow)
Lemme put it down
Hit it from the back girl don’t make a sound
New boys shots, still make it bounce
Walk in the strip club so unannounced
With a  brick of money hit her with a thou (owwww)
I laid it down let Pacquiao
Hit it so hard bitch threw in the towel
Twerk it now to my style
Watch them titties through your blouse
Move that kitty up and down
I be really in them clouds
Smoke that pussy like some loud
Shake it make your daddy proud
Never shake it for them clowns
Unless they put that money down
Watch that pussy shake around
Pop that pussy for a real nigga
Pop that pussy for me
Pop that pussy for a real nigga
Give me that pussy like A$AP

[Hook]

[Verse 3 : Jeremih]
Uh, lights up and I’m feeling hella cocky
I’m from the bottom tryna get some topy
Diamonds got a mami screaming “Hello papi”
Said she put in work and need it hella obvi
Bust it, bust it, she get hella sloppy
I just hate it in the moments I can’t put on IG
I noticed that your man is trippin’ but really that is not me
But if I wasn’t me then who the hell would I be?
Cameras rolling we should make a scene or two
Slip and sliding got me thinking “What would Trina do?”
She seen you staring at me, got me feeling
Like Ray Allen we get them hoes in 3’s
How we in the thug Cabana at La Paz in LV
Swimming your ocean all night, might as well go overseas
Is you rolling? Know I really roll, row with me
SpinKing go get all them hoes they comin’ home with me


[Hook][Hook: Jeremih]
Ahh shit, ahh shit, ahh shit
Nigga feeling good, she did
Dammit I should, alright
Now It's finna blow, green lights
And this is how it goes

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
Yolo, yo ho, on that, fo sho
Bet that shawty wet, I’m rocking her robo
Heard she like it going deep
May I take her photo
No referees up in the ring
Yeah I prefer them low blows
Her shit pop, paw paw, fo fo
I cuff her ass I’m no cop, but she call me robo
Never had a four loco, never had a 4 loco
But when they po' me up a fo' I'm leaning like a cholo
Gone yeah, gone yeah, even on my own man
You kid, i’ma type of grown man
You rent, i’ma type of own man
Your girlfriend up on me, swear he don’t know me
Now I’m all in her shit, now like roman
Now tell me how many licks does it take to
Break her, put her to sleep and bout time now she wake up
I’m fresh of a flight from the heat to the lakers
And still on a high off these trees from jamaica

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Digest, I just, live in that projects
Now I’m in that penthouse, salute my progress
Respect that process, admire my guess
Fuck being modest, nigga admire my goddess
Cause she bad, that’s obvious
She thick, that body is
Probably is, hot as Abu Dubai is
And it’s going down like
Elevators to where the lobby is
Into 9 I’m on that brown like bobby is
It’s my prerogative, I can show you how to live
Every little step you take will be in shoes Guiseppe makes
My tender roni, the one and only
Fuck me two times in case the first one get lonely
Ahhh shit, now we fucking talking
Oh is we talking fucking, but what you suckers talking?
I keep buying rides, like I suck at walking
The motto's money talk, I said what you suckers talking huhh?

Poppin' one and she wildin
Got no control of her body

And I'm tryna stay in VIP let me see your ID
And I see I amaze you
Work it hurt me you heard me
Said they never saw it in the first place
And they say that you should never put a past
Now how about we get to foreplay
And now you can't have my last name
But you can scream my first name
When I flip her from the back
And we roam in the back
So you know I had to kill it in the herse way
Smoking in the purple, LA chill out
Cali fornicate, LA fille
Grabbing on the track like fray on phrase
Riding this motherfucker to the 808
Yeah I ball 'til it to my way
If you already know Jeremih
If you got that bomb go dedinate
You know I'm that guy and if you know that bomb

Drapeau de Yoda le long de la grille
Marche ou trépasse, le nom de ma vie
Pour moi le monde c'est une petite ville
J'ai des soucis, j'ai du bonheur, j'ai une petite fille

[Couplet 1 - Booba]
Négro, pour toi c'est les tickets restos
Mets pas le nez dans mon tajine
J'baise la propriétaire
Tu lèches la chatte à la voisine
Vade retro, fils de putain des bois
Tu veux quoi ? Que j't'assassine ?
J'aurais du naître à l'époque des rois
Mudjahidin
J'ai voulu palper dans la farine
Pourquoi m'enterrer avec du 24 carats dans les narines ?
AK-47 adossés à chaque mur de la cabine
Y'a des couteaux, des carabines
Y'a de la 5amja, de la chabine

[Refrain - Jeremih]
Yeah, why these haters worried about what I'm sitting on
Just know what I'm sitting, shitting on
Pull up on a man, motherfucker, oh Lord
We the only ones up 'til the early morning
We the only ones up 'til the early morning
Anything going on, my niggas on it
There's a lot of money out here and we really want it (Yeah)
Remember when I once said
"Whatever we want, we put that work in and we gon' get it"?
'Cause me and my niggas, we all set
Monday to Sunday, 24 hours, no need to punch in

[Couplet 2 - Booba]
Taureau sur l'écusson
Érection comme en détention
La seule solution :
Que je les baise comme dans mes chansons
Triste est le game, j'suis sur une single list
Calibré jusqu'au menton tah Middle East
J'suis el mucho, t'es little bit
La prochaine fois qu'ils passent, vous leur dites (dites)
Qu'ils ne feront pas long feu
Moi le rap jeu, j'en fais ce que je veux

[Refrain - Jeremih][Verse 1: Game]
You know I love you like cooked food, I’m a good dude
Let’s hit the Roscoe’s on Pico, I’m in a hood mood
I'm sittin’ here thinkin’ ‘bout all the things I could do
So what you should do is
Play your position for Berkin bags, we poppin’ tags
Her shoe game sick, we drinkin’ Ace out of Red Bottles
True gang shit, fuck with me and you’re famous
Kanye'd my bitch, now she’s away from the nameless
Camera flashes from strangers, turn a Range to a manger
Jesus piece on the plate, yea my baby an angel
Fell straight up out of Heaven into what we into
Who knew we’d grew into, whatever we into
That’s too much for your mental so we snapback that
Game on point like the stripes on my Gucc backpack
My ladybug, yea she cool like that
In them Trues, why you move like that

[Hook: Jeremih]
You know my lady always on
She know I need it so
She know she can get
All that, all that, all that, all that, all that
My lady got me going
I’m where she already knows
She knows she can get
All that, all that, all that

[Verse 2: Lil’ Wayne]
Uh, you my lady
And that pussy feel like a haven
We can make babies, let’s be creative
She say leave them tricks alone but I’m a skater
I love her like her daddy, told her no man would
I got a lot of bad bitches, she the only one good
I got her flowers for nothing, she smiling and blushing
If I don’t answer my phone, then we probably fucking, ya
She love my tattoos
Ain’t got no room for her name but I’mma make room
She let her hair down, we have a stare down
She said “I’m glad you ate it," where my cap & gown?
Told her “I can be your chauffeur,” dick like a limo
Multiple orgasms, that’s my M.O
Redbone pretty
I kiss her from her titty to her clitty

[Hook: Jeremih]

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Look, my girl’s sweet like my hotel floor
From where they ran through more keys than a hotel door
Indeed, give her the D now the whole hotel know
Feel like I’m looking down from Heaven screaming “Oh, Hell no!”
When you hop on top, girl, that’s what it feel like
She always had a player back like them field lights
And every time I left it ain’t feel right
Cheated on her and she stayed, that’s just real life
Cause it’s hard when you ain’t on the same coast
Burning bread in the club so all these girls want toast
Hoes try and wave but we ain’t on the same boat
They trying to sink everything that we made float
She told me ‘bout her ex man, her old boy stories
And how she had a dildo, you know, toy stories
Don’t fuck her on her period, ain’t into horror stories
I take her to my favorite restaurant, she order for me
Cause she know me

[Hook: Jeremih]

[Outro: Fabolous]
I’m feeling your style
I’m loving your swag
I like how your jeans fit
You’re killing that bag
You working them heels
Your diamonds are real
You give me the chills, girl
You all that…[Hook: Natasha Mosley]
Early in the mornings when I think about you
Yeah - I hit you like “what you sayin'?”
In the mornings when I wanna fuck you
Yeah - I hit you like “what you sayin'?”
I could fuck you all the time
I could fuck you all the time

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
M-O-Ë-T, that's the fuck we sippin'
That's the fuck we drippin', trap house still tippin'
Facetime when I'm gone, she give me dome from a distance
And she love to climb on top, she love to walk off limpin'
Pimps up, hoes down, legs up or toes down
Why she jock me? ‘Cause she knocked knees and we got trees, so Mary go around
Gotta know I ate it, she so sweet, now and later
I want that all the time, all the time, I’mma give you all of mine when it’s

[Hook: Natasha Mosley]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uhh, p-p-p-pussy for breakfast, that’s how I start my day
My dick is a pen, it’s written all over her face
I put my tongue in her mouth, I make them pussy lips drool
She got that junk in her trunk, you know I like junk food
I tell her like this, life is good, your pussy better
I put on a magnum, like a gold medal
And if it’s sweet then I’mma eat it ‘til I get sugar diabetes
I’m a blood and she anemic, we perfect
Tunechi, oh yeah, I make her say
Young Mula Baby

[Hook: Natasha Mosley]

[Verse 3: Jeremih]
Damn, damn lil’ mama, you’re sticky, icky, icky
Got a nigga out here feelin’ picky, icky, icky
Every time you put it on, man, it leave me real trippy
Every time we on it we keep it 50-50, uh
Don’t let the time ticky, icky, icky
While I’m snappin’ off your bra, and bitin’ on your Vickie's
Head shots, feelin’ real tipsy
Gettin’ real freaky and it’s gettin’ real frisky
She never say, "no", damn, she’s so cold
Up and down, that pole, she go, go
Fuck me like you hate me, kiss me like you miss me
Anything I want to, that’s what she always lets me

[Hook: Natasha Mosley][Meek Mill]
I just wanna thank God
For all the pretty women he let into my life
All the Benjamins you let me count
Wealth and health
For my family
And lettin' me ball on these niggas

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Now there's a lot of bad bitches in the building (Amen)
A couple real niggas in the building (Amen)
I'm finna kill niggas in the building (Amen)
I tell the waiter fifty bottles and she tell me say when
And I say church (Preach)
We make it light up like a church (Preach)
She wanna fuck and I say church (Preach)
Do Liv on Sunday like a church (Preach)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Bottle after bottle, drink until I overdose
Pull up in the Phantom, watch them bitches catch the Holy Ghost
Errtime I step up in the dealer I be goin' broke
Shorty wanna fuck me, I say get on top and roller coast
And I lay back, she go cray, fuck me good, but she no stay
Murder on that pussy let her boyfriend get that DOA
Get it? And all I get is Frito Lay
Plus I'm on probation, when they test me I just pee Rosé
Cause last night, I went hard, Peach Ciroc, Patron and all
Thirty racks on magnum bottles, I think I was born to ball
Lookin' like a million plus, fresh I'm out that corner store
Hater I be doin' me, you guys should be doin' y'all
I'm stackin' money to the ceiling
All this ice that's in my Rollie I be chilling
And I just made a couple million
So I could take care of them children, let's go

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Drake]
Just bought my niggas some caine, so much it came with a plane
Bought my niggas some dope, so much it came with a boat
I just bought me a crib so big it came with a moat
For niggas jumping the fence I hope you niggas can float
And I just hope that I'm forgiven for carin' 'bout how they livin'
And loanin a little money and keepin' 'em out of prison
I ain't lyin' in my verses I'm just telling you the basics
Of growin' up with your friends and becoming the one that made it
Yes lord! All gold, man I got these bitches soul
Talking bout these other rappers getting old is even getting old
Worrying about your followers, you need to get your dollars up
Me and Meek, young niggas poppin' like our collars up
And good ain't good enough, and your hood ain't hood enough
Spent my whole life putting on, you spend your whole life putting up
Ain't no telling when I go, so there ain't shit that I'mma wait for
I'm the type to say a prayer, then go get what I just prayed for

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Meek Mill and Jeremih]
Lord forgive me for my sins, I'm just tryna win
And she a devil in a dress but if she knock I let her in
And if she knock I let her in
I have her wet by 12 o' clock, then 3 o' clock she wet again
I'm screaming Oh Lord, that pussy good, that pussy good
I'm tryna hold on, I wish I could, you think I should
She got that million dollar body, shorty my Bugatti
And she said she got a man, we keep it secret Illuminati
(Got Patron on deck) And Ciroc all in my bottle
(Push it all on her) She was on that Reposado
(She take it all off) And I think I'll rep Serato
In this bitch I'm spending like I hit the lotto cause it's a lot of...

[Hook][Hook: Jeremih]
Got a good thing goin' with a bad bitch
You know who to call when you need it
Wish I had another you, I'm greedy
Sometimes like that nigga get greedy
Got damn I fell in love with a bad bitch
You know that every time you leave me
Even though I know how men be talkin'
I just know that nigga wanna be me
Came in here and fell in love with a bad bitch
Back then she ain't have shit
Now she grown up, she got ass, tits
Wanna know where she got that ass at
She hit my heart, a toot, toot on it
She got a dump truck, I put a boot on it
Don't mind spendin' this loot on it
Treat her like my whip, I put some shoes on her

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Got a dump truck, put a boot on her
I don't mind trickin', spendin' loot on her
Walk up in the club, and toot, toot on her
She's a bad bitch, put shoes on her
God damn, fell in love with a bad bitch
Said, "French, take me to Paris"
Dominican mami from Cali
I said, "Gon' bend it over, let me grab it"
I said, "Gon' bend it over, make it nasty"
Walked up in the club, rollin', Stevie Wonder glasses
I ain't lookin' at you niggas, lookin' way past you
Young, fly, G's up, pocket full of cash
You know where to find me, you know when you need me
All my dogs eat, they'll tell you I ain't greedy
I ain't gon' love her, too much to leave her
I ain't goin' public, surely is easy

[Hook]

[Verse 2: French Montana & Jeremih]
Pull up with my niggas, make a move
Red light, green light, no it ain't Gucci
Used to walk up in the store, couldn't afford that
Now I walk up in the store, buyin' all that
Drink it to the head, man, nigga feelin' woozy
Pull up in the old school, boy I'm on some new shit
Red to the head, man we gettin' all that
And shorty phone answers, she don't ever call back
And I can see why these niggas hate me
Pull up in a drop and the watch 80
Pull up to the front but a nigga faded
Got a new crib and the shit gated
Came from the bottom, watch a nigga ball out
Drink it to the head, smoke 'til you fall out
Countin' up this money, nigga, keep the door locked
All my niggas gettin' to this money, no lie

[Hook][Hook: Jeremih]
Got a good thing goin' with a bad bitch

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Can’t be talking loud homie with your G-Shock
Laces jumping out the foreign with the T top
Coke boys, niggas got the whole streets locked
Max B still eyes on the east side
Pinky ring, may be running with the car cost
It may be something when you run into a mob boss
On trial, nigga blind in his left eye
TOC, where the rouges, wet up on the west side
Got to play the game of life like a chessboard
Rip your hair off, fuck your arrest warrant
One call, all the shooters on deck boy
Thought she peed on me, pussy so wet boy
Fucking all night, now we call it Ross fit
Red Chanel bag for the bitches boss hit
Marshawn Lynch, money on offense
Might catch me in the D with a soft whip

[Hook: Jeremih]

[Verse 2: French Montana & Jeremih]
Pull up with my niggas, make a move

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Nice chick got cake, call her sweet cheeks
Fuck good, clean her house, she a neat freak
I want the 2016, that new prezi
I want sloppy, not a bitch that’s too messy
I done heard all the lies, baby you can save it
But saying it was mine had to be my favorite
All her friends like girl you getting thick
Dope boys on her like she getting bricks
Mami said love don’t cross her thing
Now she want the Cartier bracelet and a ring
Stick up and it made me skeet skeet fast
Wasn’t even raw, I had the skeet ski-mask
I’m a road runner, had to beep beep past
See me looking square, it’ll be G class nigga
Ay, my main focus is remain focus
You hoes ain’t notice cause you ain’t focused

[Hook: Jeremih][Intro: French Montana] + (Diddy)
Montana
That untouchable empire, baby, Coke Boy
(Bad Boy) They say careful what you ask for
Cause when you get it, you know what you gon' tell 'em right?
(We're baaa-aack)

[Hook: Jeremih]
What you say? I do this err'day, wh-what you say? I do this err'day
Do this err day, do this err day, do this err day, do this err day
What you say? I do this, wh-wh-what you say? I do this err'day
Do this err'day, do this err'day, do this err'day, do this err'day

[Interlude: Diddy] + (French Montana)
(Jeremih) French Montana!
(Hah... what they talkin 'bout, Puff?)
They ain't talkin 'bout, nothin
This the moment they feel ya, let's get back when I get there
They've seen what it is, so look it down
Bad Boy, Blood Line, get up, talk to 'em

[Jeremih]
I got tats all on my arm, racks on racks in the bank
Forgiato my rims, pepsi blue my paint
All these girls be choosy, can't find a bitch who ain't
Haters they are ballin' like fishes in a tank
Stuntin' with my whole crew, hangin' out the window when we roll up
You know when we come through, make it rain we don't give a fuck
Bout what you say, I do this every day; don't buy bottles, buy by the case
Seem like every night my birthday I can't help but get the cake

[Bridge: Jeremih]
Feel like I was born for ballin' out
Live it up and just for fallin' out

[Hook]

[French Montana]
MONTANA~!
Tattoos on my neck, half a mill in my car
Dream team I rep, just me and my dogs
Stray cash in that haircut, sea bass, no lamb chops
Met her at the bar, tryin' to get some head shots
62 that Maybach, fake jewels don't play that
Take off like Blake Griff, money tall like A6
Never hit that red zone, baby I was airborne
Hoppin' out that Ghost sippin' red dot with that red bone
Trunk up in the back, drop the population
And I'm never fakin' Jacks, you know I'm poppin' Aces
I'mma ball, illuminati bank rolls
Suicide Lambo Doors and two italian taned hoes

[Hook] + [Bridge]

[Diddy]
Yeah, yeah, my mic sounds nice right now
1-2, ayo, pure Blood Line baby, check it out...
I'm flyin' around and I'm gettin' it like 90 Thou in my denim
Told a bitch I just met, write your problems down and I'll end 'em
I'm creepin' on a billi, got these niggas buyin' largely
Bout to take my LA crib and drop that bitch on Wall Street
Peep my watch and hand game, like Peach Ciroc and Champagne
You buyin' jets, I could buy the Jets, I ain't speakin' 'bout no damn planes
This passion and pain fashion, matchin' my things catchin'
Action from things mackin', then flashin' my rings captain
Twin V's, entire, envy my attire
Catalogue, but don't have the heart cause real kings build empires
Everything that I said nigga was everything that you saw
I did everything that I claim, you ain't like us cause we ball

[Hook] + [Bridge]

[Outro: French Montana] + (Diddy)
(Ayo, this the way it lives, this what it is)

If you ain't heard you live under a motherfuckin' rock (Coke Boyz)

We was born to fly baby, still do the same thing nigga
Shit sound like I just sold nigga
Untouchable Empire, Bad Boy, Coke Boy

Watch me beat it and stroke it, beat it and stroke it

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
Hey, I've been chillen in-between a couple condos

That's right me got some titties and thighs on it
I'm gonna fuck around and beat it, put some miles on you
I Know you’ll let me if I ask, Gon shawty bring that ass on
Shawty bring that ass on, legs up put 'em to the sky for me
I'm not sure if you're ready, I'm not sure if you're ready
I'm not sure if you're ready, I'm not sure if you're ready

[Hook: Young Thug]

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Beat it up, stroke it for Thugger

Heat it up, eat it up, baby girl, I'm (?)

You ain't figured I'm the one yet
Motherfuckers sleepin' on ya boy
Y'all niggas waitin' on the sunset
Just copped a crib off Sunset
Bank account fat now my son set
I just do this shit for fun, to tell the truth I ain't even havin' fun yet
Just copped a Bentley coupe, left the Range Rover on 13th 22
Shawty bootylicious like Beyoncé but the lil bitch only 22
Makin power moves like Khaled
Make me feel like we the best
Wouldn't signed to Def Jam
If I would have knew that they were deaf
I don't honour no rules
Guess I live my life lawless
Niggas thinkin' I'mma fall
But my name ain't August
Change bitches like the seasons
Blowin' money no reasons
'Lotta bitches in my DM's
She could probably be your BM

[Break: Chi Hoover]
Money make the world go round
Fuck with me and make your girl go round
Big dawg shit
Big dawg shit

[Verse 2: Jeremih]
Tryna get my pockets like Rasputia
Feelin' like the Prince of Zamunda
Woke up this mornin' and a nigga had a dream
That I'ma king, Martin Luther
Most of these niggas be bitches
Most of these hoes ain't loyal
These niggas talkin' bout self
I ain't even trust their lawyers
Had some niggas stashed with me that'll try you
Already fucked your bitch, I ain't even gotta try to
On the line talkin' money me and Hoover

[Verse 3: Chi Hoover]
What up?
Fuck with Jay then I fuck around and shoot ya
Big dawg we don't fuck with no poodles
Press a button, top drop, car roofless
I'm Marty McFly in that ride
Whip lookin' like Back to the Future
Hol' up[Verse 1]
It's your birthday so I know you want to ride out
Even if we only go to my house
Sip mo-eezy as we sit upon my couch
Feels good, but I know you want to
Cry out
You say you want passion

Get ready for action
Don't be astounded
We switching positions
You feel surrounded
