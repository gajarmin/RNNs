Chorus

Dem' shoot at us
Turn around and deny it
People on the streets are dying
We must come together
Fight depression and pull de pressure
On de system that tries to diss us
Tries to hurt us, and tries to kill us
We don't win, we fight again
We gon' fight until the end, until the end
We fight until we win, until we win

Sabac

Unjustified shootings, fatal chokins, severe beatins
Police attack the innocent without fair reason
Precincts are full of cowards abusin authority
Minorities abuse majority, people livin in poverty
Priority, is them doing right by the nation
But large parts of it's been human rights violation
Tired of being patient waitin for internal affairs
To show. Improve this, the truth is, we've been burnin for years
Use your weapons, fight back kid, that's how the game goes
My boy Kevin got his skull cracked by pigs in plain clothes
They told him there's agress, if he doesn't stay calm
And proceeded to put cigarettes out in his palm
Now he can't think, he can't feel
Sometimes you gotta grab steel, blast, peal
Before they sentence you and serve your last meal
I know fightin back is easier said then actin
Let's start movin forward and stop steppin backwards

Chorus

Immortal Technique

On the day, me and Sabac Red
Drop dead, knocked by the feds
Or get shot with a Glock in the head
Like the.. bloods on the corner, the block'll be red
And like the passion of Christ, there'll be alot to be said
Fuck a protest in the street wit all of my peeps
My soul will never let a crooked cops family sleep
And you'll never find peace, even them retired men
Like I'mma do to all yo cops that turned into firemen
I'll keep your children lyin in a sleepin hypnosis
Nightmares about drownin in the ocean erosions
Molested by dead bodies full of worms and locousts
But the insects are nothing when the judgement approaches
Call my spirit the coldest, you say that I'm bitter
But I'm sick of cops callin me a spic and nigga
And you pigs probably won't get the message I write you
Cuz the industry is racist, mother fuckers just like you

Chorus

Sabac

Not everyone is built for war when it comes to cops and
Fear plays a part so I'll inform you of your options
Get the names and badges of cops from the precinct
Show your face in the street so police know you decent
Keep them on their toes take flicks and videos
Impose injustices cuz them clips can be gold
Hold a coalition in your buildin, a new movement
Raise cash, start a civilian review unit
Be aware of wrong doings, inform your whole alliance
Write the senator to put a end to the cold and silence
Let's unite fight back know our rights watch the government
Apply better laws and enforce harsher punishment
For pigs who beat kids for no apparent reason
We acted on the defense while battlin the precinct
If the system won't respond to your truth and facts
Bear arms, they've been warned, retaliate and shoot back

Chorus[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
It’s a burgundy bath, everybody get turned into ash
Being evil just something I made my personal task
The G36 put you in surgery fast
Everybody die regardless who first or who last
Death almost got me twice but he mercifully passed
I’ll take your face off without using surgical masks
I wouldn’t call it an ego but I’m certainly gassed
This isn’t the Desert Eagle but it certainly smash
If I don’t get money from rhyming that’s a fateful day
I might have to take it back to the kitchen like Rachael Ray
I don’t put no work in with bitches, I’m trying to scrape today
Anywhere in my environment is not the place to play
If I’m hungry in need of food I’ll pull a skully down
I don’t fuck with workers, I’m gunning whoever run the town
I got enough clips with me to spit a hundred rounds
I’m the father of Christ and y’all are just the son of clowns
I don’t think that y’all can fuck with Vinnie but let’s see
I’mma have this fucking Lama looking like Jet Li
Everybody who is anybody respects me
I’ll have you bleeding out your back like it’s a jet ski

[Hook: Ill Bill]

Motherfucker, what’s really real, really ill?
Run up on you, hit you with Israeli steel, yo we really will
Through windshields, windpipes and car seats
You die on the Belt Parkway next to Canarsie

[Verse 2: Ill Bill]
Brutal tribes indulge in slavery and human sacrifice
The shooters pack devices capable of proving lack of life
With no compassion, ratchet action, flashing, fashion
Blast for cash, assassins faster than the flash
Amass a body count, surpass the sound barrier
And shattered by the splatter, rattled you
Waking shaking sober, gats that kick back and dislocate your shoulder
Decapitate your head and chop you in half, pop you and laugh
? in gas find you amongst the cowards and fags
Find me holding the rifle on the watchtower with plans
So never underestimate me or the power of Paz
Lock you in the room with the lion, now how would you last?
You can’t fight the king of the jungle, he’ll devour you fast
Put you underneath the dirt next to the flowers and grass
At the funeral mommas and dads get showered with gats
You kill one us and we’ll kill one of you, counterattack
Thousands of stacks from hustling these powders and cracks

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Reef The Lost Cauze]
I fucking pick and peel your chain, Official Pistol Gang
From Kill Devil Hills to Pennsylvain we be gripping change
You little pencil brains, before I lose to you
I’ll cut my nuts and slit my veins, all y’all do is bitch complain
Henny and pills, plenty of steel
On the block with fifties and krill word to Vinnie and Bill
In South Philly for real, my hood is guineas and Campbells
Niggas and dirty Irish who think that they SAMCRO
And oh my fan know the stream, fuck the man yo
No book em, Danno, you ain’t Rambo
Don’t put twenty in your hand bone when my fam roam
That’s when the grams go, soft white, my niggas call it that damn snow
And fuck hip hop, I got sick pot in ziplocks
I get from stoners in Cali rocking flip flops
One brand is called Sit-Stop cause after one hit
That bitch’ll have you dancing with the stars like Rick Fox

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Sabac]
Yo we have walked back together to gorillas and wolves
The illest of goons, the room is filled with killers and booze
Pretty soon we breaking in your office building with tools
Assassinate the CEO for catching feelings and moods
The steel at the moon got us raising hell on the block
If they manipulate us like a pretty face and smelly twat
Tell me what is power, cash, hand, guns, and hoorah
A brutal task between thieves, priests, nuns and Korans
I’m on a path that has the cash, has bigger and better things
I’ve been with veteran medicine men headed to Medellin
Bring the noise and avoid the vicious cycle of prison
It’s all poison, Kool G Rap, Michael Bivins
Speed of NASCAR, "rooh", Madagascar soon
Consume a rock star "ooh" Allahu Akbar "boom!"
Wounded and killed, rumours are real
Israeli steel caught your peoples in the grill, now the tomb is concealed[Intro: The Knife by Genesis]

Stand up and fight, for you know we are right
We must strike at the lies that have spread like disease through our minds
Some of you are going to die
Martyrs of course to the freedom that I shall provide

[Verse 1: Slaine]

It’s mind control, they’ve stolen my mind
I used to have the mind of a revolutionary now it’s dead
Cause the Devil got these images that’s dancing in my head
If I don’t take these pills then I can’t get out of bed
And I gotta pay the bills so I gotta take my meds
That’s what the voice says, it was never there before
It was another voice that’s telling me you’re a father, you’re a husband
The argument is hard to win, it leads to more discussion
Every other thought is rushing like it’s fucking water busting
I’ve been sleeping with the TV cause I left it on
Pass out from the Xani bars licking chicken szechuan
Broken fingers figure shit I think it must’ve kept em gone
Otherwise I’m like a ticking effin bomb weapon drawn
Pace around the floor freaking every creak I’m stepping on
Thought I heard the cops coming no I must’ve guessed it wrong
Flip the stations all around, nothing but deception on
I don’t know what’s real or not, here on planet methadone

[Verse 2: Trademarc]

Look I’ve never been mistaken for the social type
Overnight mix and match meds and get the potion right
Name it I take it I took it I baked it cooked it and ate it
Like God made it till I’m crooked
Psycho pharmaceuticals rebooted my brain
My death is stained by whatever’s fun, the proof in my veins
So when I took it I stare at my reflection like it’s throwing threats in my direction
Now I look at life and cope like any addict
Might be an addict by candlelight
Every shade drawn, every day’s dawn good and gone as I write
You can bet it’s like street corner hustling
FDA muscle in funnelling cash into new epidemics
They usher in mass produced pain
Paranoia that they mask with their lawyers and brass
Next stop poisonous gas, chill the citizen’s strain
Chain smoke stacks burn us to ash

[Hook]

We living in them days of the manmade ways
They brainwashing us, it’s America’s plan
I’m about to rebel, we all slaves in the system
We’re dying over money and relying on religion

We living in them days of the manmade ways
They brainwashing us, it’s America’s plan
I’m about to rebel, we all slaves in the system
We’re dying over money and relying on religion

[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]

I used to have the mind of a revolutionary but it’s gone
I’m dishevelled, I’m a rebel, I’m a devil with a bomb
As I settle every motherfucking ghetto has a song
Put the metal to my temple when I wrestle with Saddam
Yeah you see the mind control divide your soul
I rhymed it though in ‘94 but no
Y’all ain’t listened to anything I was telling y’all
About the biochip inside you and impending war
I run over you fucking devils like I’m Mendenhall
Overseas they dying young, they sending y’all
The cash system is dead, y’all just pretend to ball
Glocks and clips, apocalypse repent or fall
Do y’all believe in the birth of a nation?
I call it control, they call it coercive persuasion
Yeah all of them serpents of Satan
I’mma build a bomb shelter, only let the persons of faith in

[Verse 4: Sabac Red]

We live a harsh reality, get our brains washed out with filthy water
Caught up in the thrill of boarders walk among the killing quarters
I form a line of obsessive aggressive ill New Yorkers
Who build a fortress on top of bodies with rigor mortis
We saw this coming, history repeats and beats its sword
The difference is now businesses are center of disease control
Diabetes, VDs, cancer, and AIDS
Increasing the obesity as if we cannot be saved
Faced with their paranoia avoid the call to actions in arms
Engaged the act of warriors we all paying taxes for bombs
They taxing the farms, the labourers make minimum wage
Here in the States them owners sick, they’re paying women as slaves
It’s the beginning of phase 8, new decade and new plot
They sit and create plagues, inject us with flu shots
Behaviour reform informs away from the norm
It’s mind control, define your soul decide your faith or get gone

[Hook]

We living in them days of the manmade ways
They brainwashing us, it’s America’s plan
I’m about to rebel, we all slaves in the system
We’re dying over money and relying on religion

We living in them days of the manmade ways
They brainwashing us, it’s America’s plan
I’m about to rebel, we all slaves in the system
We’re dying over money and relying on religion

We living in them days of the manmade ways

Listen to me because less than 3% of you people read books, because less than 15% of you read newspapers. Right now there is an entire generation that never knew anything. The largest company in the world controls the most awesome propaganda force in the whole world. So if you want the truth go to yourselves! Because that’s the only place you’re ever going to find any real truth[Hook: Hell Razah]

Aiyo peep it, I build like the pyramids of Egypt
Born October the first, it was an eclipse
Sittin' in the back of the Caddy with my daddy
Raised off of Curtis, Al Green and Barry
We came from the alleys to buildin' at rallies
Now we see unity from Brooklyn to Cali
I walk through the Valley of Death
Y'all better go and carry a vest
Cuz ain't no batteries left
I'm possesed by the spirits sometimes I'm Malcolm X
I confessed to the church and reversed the bomb threat
Bring the war to the Pentagon, I'll polly on in Babylon
They make hits like Barry Bonds
I drop jewels like Fahrakkhan
Y'all niggas only shine when them lights and cameras on
A Renaissance Child is gone, say "Shalom"
Open my palm and read "I'm a prophet of God"...

Rock spot veterans, plot upon medicine
Spot for our benefit, why God invented it
Fifty four seventeen Farington, moms rented it
Listen close for those that cannot remember it
Two bench room formin' in the project teniment
Mad beef everyday, even my grandma represent
Everyready cuz the PJ's is like startin' a race
Five minutes late, step up the pace
It ain't about where you from it's where you goin'
But that don't mean that you should turn your back on where you came from
Homey, digital mastered, first time on DVD
Critically acclaimed, my words rhyme on TV screens
Perfectly, scientifically, inertly
My verses speak mercilessly, manifestation of eternity
First degree surges move, mercenaries use serpent juice
Curse the youth, burn the truth, churches or schools
Goverments or army, Commy's fast versus Nazi's
Coke dealers, co-D's, it's Dhali Lama's or Swami's
Grip some produce at swap meets, gangstafied hip-hop beats
Brought by the El Dorados in Jeeps
Overseas we're top models and freaks
We pop bottles and grease
Hopin' we be promised tomorrow at least

Smell the endo, music blare out the windows
The beats reign, peep fools that stare at my skintone
Child of the eighties, crack and Reagenomics
Wild as a baby, I'm back to pay homage
Scarlets and windows, all the truth of my neighbors
Front of New Yig's bodegga was the fruits of my labor
The movers and fakers, justifyin' the blocks
Bunch of losers and faggots in disguise with the cops
The arrival of Watts and Bedstuy embracin'
The economy shot, red eyes and made men
Interrogation, evil, the trojan ain't protected by the nation of the people
Buildin' schools they neglected
A message from the Kings and Queens, Gods and Goddesses
Aggressive in the scheme of things, heart of Spartacus
Regardless if life ain't right or lookin' easy
Creativity grows in Brooklyn, believe me

[Hook x2][Verse 1: I'll Bill]
Listen to Art Bell, Cookie Puss like Carvel
Bulletproof like Luca age 12 Marvel
Bohemian Grove speaking Elohimian code
Under the table sale of reptilian skulls
Sherm, purple pill, word to Bill, murder guild, burn your face
Burger grill meatloaf head Gucci and cokeheads
A Lopez wannabe, Scarface operated
Another Scarface incarcerated
He said dude, bro, had a jew fro, looked like Tony Kukoc
High glucose and blood sugar drug boogers
Trouble shooters, double Grey Goose
Trey deuce in the bubble goose
Hundred proof, who the fuck are you?
Came through with a Brooklyn face
Jordan started [?] to crooked taste
Blew a whole in the wall and took the safe
Got knocked, got a nose job and blew the case
Then knocked again cause after surgery he looked the same

[Hook:]
Easy to tell, fuck with me and I will see you in Hell
The unfuckwithable, the uncrushable
There ain't no stopping the unstoppable

Easy to tell, fuck with me and I will see you in Hell
The unfuckwithable, the uncrushable
There ain't no stopping the unstoppable

[Verse 2: Sicknature]
They tell him break a leg so he can start off on the wrong foot
And go stomping toward the coffin coughing the wrong hook
Loosen his numerals son of [?]
While the industrial tumors grow
The whole fucking world is a Truman Show
A true to first like I'm fucking smacking your Tonka
They come with war tech, they're smarter than Hannibal Barca
Personality sniper strikes till every bastard is lifeless
The newest fancy gadgets, using tracking devices
They be sniffing your route when you chill on a couch
They planted shit in your house claiming that you dipping your snout
But the law points fingers from the villains it's out
Every third pig is using bricks when building his house
A rough world, nobody's staged and accidents happen global
From the fucking Titanic to the factories in Chernobyl
But you keep standing firm so keep turning it louder
Keep banging your head so your cranium turn into powder
He's uncrushable

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sabac Red]
I do dirt then wash my hands with the water of Satan
Reverse the roles and merge the souls, see the god in it's making
Shaking exorcism mathematics science and pagans awaiting death
While life is lived in the lines of the pavements
Creating off seeds, we all bleed and thirst for blood
Invading [?], chasing dreams facing curse of love
It's kinda bugged when your affection doesn't match your intentions
And attention that you gain is only based on when you're mentioned
Dreading Armageddon I'm forgetting all of the rules
Possessed by pussy greedy drugs and never letting them lose
Cruise ships got surveillance when we vacate with the aliens
And share notes and Ambien the State we're preparing them
Be wary of their lies and deceitful truths
The scary minds are the wise and streets is proof
We move fast and try to last for the rest of the way
Because tomorrow should better than yesterday's today[Verse 1: Sabac Red]

I have a dream of reaching Heaven
Me and Malcolm, we’re chatting
About impeaching presidents and how my album went platinum
I’m asking to ? out of the struggles inside of me
As a nation will develop and govern our own society
I dream of a time where there’s a cure for AIDS
And no longer will the people be afraid to get laid
Think how great it would be to stop choosing deception
When intelligent minds replace the nuclear weapons
I’m heading for a dream where the weed will be legal
The homeless will have homes and we can keep feeding the people
I need to see every father keep supporting his kids
Where hip hop entertains and remains informative
I dream the price of gasoline won’t rise no more
So that the innocent people don’t have to die for war
Or put an end to oppression, the fights and constant feuding
Have the people united, rewrite the Constitution
I have a dream

[Hook: Cenophia Mitchell]

I have a dream
I want to wake up to a revolution
I have a dream
People will rise up, become wiser
I waana see people uniting after the fighting
I have a dream but I gotta wake up now

[Verse 2: Dash Mihok]

I had a dream that my body, mind, and soul was united
The wrongs are all righted, I know how to be happy but fight it
I dream that I might have a little more control of my ticks
And hold a role in some flicks where I was boning a chick
And I could roll up to the Golden Globes laced in newly stolen clothes
And throw ? statue and a microphone
I have a dream that freestyle circles could be more supportive
And stop the spitting of the ? that we all get bored of
A dream where people see the dream is abundant
I fiend for a hundred but lend it friends that need it, not love it
Uncover the dream where people see a broken heart and go and mend it
Now go and play the part, it ain’t the art of co-dependence
I dream the only time the drama’s when we come up out our mamas
She could promise we’re protected from the bombers
I’mma dream about the day where the fear has been lifted
Shed a tear, grab a beer, and toast to the year of the gifted
I have a dream

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sabac Red]

I have a dream the media will build the minds of the youth
As opposed to holding us down, we’ll keep finding the truth
We won’t fall for what they showing us, no one will be owning us
Move towards Utopia and heal all the phobias
I have a dream all my fans will keep supporting me
Religion won’t be based on man’s organized conformity
It ought to be a time of us gaining our self-identity
Yo I dream for the power, the fame and wealth of the Kennedys
I enter these days with the intention to change
The death penalty and put lethal injections away
Its invention will save the lives of people addicted
Racism will be evicted, we’ll be equal to kick it
It’s a wicked world but we possess the power to change
The poverty, depression unless it is ours to claim
? believe a day to become what it means
I found it only right and fair to share some of these dreams

[Hook]This one right here
This for all the young people
All over the world
Who are suffering
As a result of our mistakes

This for every child who needs love and stability
For every boy and girl who needs a hug and it's killing me
To see young people so torn and abrasive
Being taught wrong no child is born racist
Faced with peer pressure
Poor education they're made to feel less
So lets do more to save 'em
They're behaving erratic based on needs and status
They just wanna feel safe
So they feed into habits
Now they're smoking and drinking
They're fucking and cutting
They're depressed it's a mess
But they're just hunting for something
A way to feel good a safe place in the hood
Nurture all their dreams
Keep telling them they could
Be whatever they choose
Begin changing the rules
They're our future
Teach what they ?dont learn? in schools
More than science and math
Start providing a path
To the youth its not your fault you were dying so fast!

I see promise in our youth even more than they do
Some are bothered by the truth like a form of abuse
I keep warning them too, break the cycle and grow
But the history of violence is frightfull and cold
In the night they're alone, in the day they rebel
Too many fights in the home, too many say they will fail
Its a never ending battle for acceptance and love
The pressure for respect and protection from us
Man just look what we've done project war with our guns
And at home we dont protect our own daughters and sons
Neglecting the ones who have the answer to life
The solutions to the problems we abandon at night
I will stand for their rights cuz their lifes are cheated
Continue to support them and fight for freedom
Its a crisis in sequence from these selfish victims
Their lifes are weakened by someone elses decisions

Look at the suicide rate
Look at what they decide
Look at who was irate
Look at drugs they subscribe
They're manic, bipolar, the adhd
Our maybe its the world and how we raise 'em to be
Look what they see on TV
They watching too much
Mom and pops workin late cause the economy sucks
Teenage girls locked up at a crucial rate
Statistics show they where physically abused or raped
How much more can they take before they snap and react?
Hurt themselves and someone else another tragic attack
We laugh at the past then we hope for the best
But the past will just reflect the present knowing whats next
We messed up, toxicated dirty water disease infected foods drug abuse life caught in the streets
We're forcin our seeds to take more than they should
So grown folk give em hope and make sure that they goodThis one right here

We gon' fight until the end, until the end
We fight until we win, until we win

My boy Kevin got his skull cracked by pigs in plain clothes
They told him there's agress, if he doesn't stay calm
And proceeded to put cigarettes out in his palm

Fuck a protest in the street wit all of my peeps

Get the names and badges of cops from the precinct
Show your face in the street so police know you decent

Impose injustices cuz them clips can be gold
Hold a coalition in your buildin, a new movement
Raise cash, start a civilian review unit
Be aware of wrong doings, inform your whole alliance
Write the senator to put a end to the cold and silence

And hold a role in some flicks where I was boning a chick
And I could roll up to the Golden Globes laced in newly stolen clothes
And throw ? statue and a microphone
I have a dream that freestyle circles could be more supportive
And stop the spitting of the ? that we all get bored of
A dream where people see the dream is abundant
I fiend for a hundred but lend it friends that need it, not love it
Uncover the dream where people see a broken heart and go and mend it
Now go and play the part, it ain’t the art of co-dependence
I dream the only time the drama’s when we come up out our mamas
She could promise we’re protected from the bombers
I’mma dream about the day where the fear has been lifted
Shed a tear, grab a beer, and toast to the year of the gifted
I have a dream

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sabac Red]

I have a dream the media will build the minds of the youth
As opposed to holding us down, we’ll keep finding the truth
We won’t fall for what they showing us, no one will be owning us
Move towards Utopia and heal all the phobias
I have a dream all my fans will keep supporting me
Religion won’t be based on man’s organized conformity
It ought to be a time of us gaining our self-identity
Yo I dream for the power, the fame and wealth of the Kennedys
I enter these days with the intention to change
The death penalty and put lethal injections away
Its invention will save the lives of people addicted
Racism will be evicted, we’ll be equal to kick it
It’s a wicked world but we possess the power to change
The poverty, depression unless it is ours to claim
? believe a day to become what it means
I found it only right and fair to share some of these dreams

[Hook][Intro: The Knife by Genesis]

Stand up and fight, for you know we are right
We must strike at the lies that have spread like disease through our minds
Some of you are going to die
Martyrs of course to the freedom that I shall provide

[Verse 1: Slaine]

It’s mind control, they’ve stolen my mind
I used to have the mind of a revolutionary now it’s dead
Cause the Devil got these images that’s dancing in my head
If I don’t take these pills then I can’t get out of bed
And I gotta pay the bills so I gotta take my meds
That’s what the voice says, it was never there before
It was another voice that’s telling me you’re a father, you’re a husband
The argument is hard to win, it leads to more discussion
Every other thought is rushing like it’s fucking water busting
I’ve been sleeping with the TV cause I left it on
Pass out from the Xani bars licking chicken szechuan
Broken fingers figure shit I think it must’ve kept em gone
Otherwise I’m like a ticking effin bomb weapon drawn
Pace around the floor freaking every creak I’m stepping on
Thought I heard the cops coming no I must’ve guessed it wrong
Flip the stations all around, nothing but deception on
I don’t know what’s real or not, here on planet methadone

[Verse 2: Trademarc]

Look I’ve never been mistaken for the social type
Overnight mix and match meds and get the potion right
Name it I take it I took it I baked it cooked it and ate it
Like God made it till I’m crooked
Psycho pharmaceuticals rebooted my brain
My death is stained by whatever’s fun, the proof in my veins
So when I took it I stare at my reflection like it’s throwing threats in my direction
Now I look at life and cope like any addict
Might be an addict by candlelight
Every shade drawn, every day’s dawn good and gone as I write
You can bet it’s like street corner hustling
FDA muscle in funnelling cash into new epidemics
They usher in mass produced pain
Paranoia that they mask with their lawyers and brass
Next stop poisonous gas, chill the citizen’s strain
Chain smoke stacks burn us to ash

[Hook]

We living in them days of the manmade ways
They brainwashing us, it’s America’s plan
I’m about to rebel, we all slaves in the system
We’re dying over money and relying on religion

We living in them days of the manmade ways
They brainwashing us, it’s America’s plan
I’m about to rebel, we all slaves in the system
We’re dying over money and relying on religion

[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]

I used to have the mind of a revolutionary but it’s gone
I’m dishevelled, I’m a rebel, I’m a devil with a bomb
As I settle every motherfucking ghetto has a song
Put the metal to my temple when I wrestle with Saddam
Yeah you see the mind control divide your soul
I rhymed it though in ‘94 but no
Y’all ain’t listened to anything I was telling y’all
About the biochip inside you and impending war
I run over you fucking devils like I’m Mendenhall
Overseas they dying young, they sending y’all
The cash system is dead, y’all just pretend to ball
Glocks and clips, apocalypse repent or fall
Do y’all believe in the birth of a nation?
I call it control, they call it coercive persuasion
Yeah all of them serpents of Satan
I’mma build a bomb shelter, only let the persons of faith in

[Verse 4: Sabac Red]

We live a harsh reality, get our brains washed out with filthy water
Caught up in the thrill of boarders walk among the killing quarters
I form a line of obsessive aggressive ill New Yorkers
Who build a fortress on top of bodies with rigor mortis
We saw this coming, history repeats and beats its sword
The difference is now businesses are center of disease control
Diabetes, VDs, cancer, and AIDS
Increasing the obesity as if we cannot be saved
Faced with their paranoia avoid the call to actions in arms
Engaged the act of warriors we all paying taxes for bombs
They taxing the farms, the labourers make minimum wage
Here in the States them owners sick, they’re paying women as slaves
It’s the beginning of phase 8, new decade and new plot
They sit and create plagues, inject us with flu shots
Behaviour reform informs away from the norm
It’s mind control, define your soul decide your faith or get gone

[Hook]

We living in them days of the manmade ways
They brainwashing us, it’s America’s plan
I’m about to rebel, we all slaves in the system
We’re dying over money and relying on religion

We living in them days of the manmade ways
They brainwashing us, it’s America’s plan
I’m about to rebel, we all slaves in the system
We’re dying over money and relying on religion

We living in them days of the manmade ways

[Clip from Network]

Listen to me because less than 3% of you people read books, because less than 15% of you read newspapers. Right now there is an entire generation that never knew anything. The largest company in the world controls the most awesome propaganda force in the whole world. So if you want the truth go to yourselves! Because that’s the only place you’re ever going to find any real truth[Necro]
The world is filled with problems and misfortune
Bombs and abortion, ex-cons, extortion, enron, divorce and exxon
I have a tendency towards sadness, a dependency on madness
Hennessey makes me unfriendly then I stab shit
I live an entirely different life than you
I'm down and violently riff with a knife to get what I like cuz the system is trife
I choose evil cuz it's easier, the sleazier the better
Cuz I'm too lazy to go out of my way to please ya
In seven years the world will be finished
Triple sixes nuclear buttons pushed, kid, Necrodamus predicts it
When we die we turn into shit like flies
No heaven just hell on earth, so I keep victimising innocent eyes

[Sabac]
For all the nazis said the US punks in our wig
Today America is still the greatest country to live
I visited places with no runnin water for forces
We're fortunate to have it clean, the most can't often afford it
I aborted a violent past, avoided going to prison
Supported the thought and task and giving hope to the livin
Promote my mission of a time filled with balance and peace
I find strength in enemies and what keeps challengin me
I'm in the streets teaching teens about justice and freedom
N how essential they are and how we trust em and need em
I'm speaking truth, all the proof is in how far we have come
Let's celebrate what we've accomplished, but our job isn't done

[Dj Eclipse cuts - Positive and Negative]

[Necro]
My relationships with women are dictatorships
Impregnate a bitch, I'm not responsible, let someone else raise the kid
Cause and effect is bullshit; nothing ever affects me
My Beretta protects me - Fuck god, he better respect me
You ain't blowing up rapper, none of us are
Unless you mean blowing up with a bomb under your car
Only thing your promised is a death or disease, a bullet
Or natural cause, there's no debate - I'm actually sure
I ain't clickin with you, you're looking at me ill, I'm flippin on you
No one stoppin me when I stick a knife in you juice in your grill
There can never be a day of positive
Without negative slashin positive's face with a razor to balance the odds with

[Sabac]
My twin sister's sober, no longer smoked up on crack
I got food on my table, a home n clothes on my back
My motive's in tact, my vision's now clearer than ever
I recently settled the beef with the man in the mirror
I stand and deliver, don't worry 'bout housin no more
It feel good to make some money, got my album in stores
As bad as it seems, the tunnel got light at the end
I'm optimistic bout where we're headed with rights and defense
Defend ourselves to live a brighter day, no longer will we hide away
Forever will we learn the predator will fight to bite the prey
My right to say that we will overcome any big obstacle
It's not impossible if you believe in livin logical

[Dj Eclipse cuts - Positive and Negative (cus the world's a contradiction)]

[Hook: Cenophia Mitchell)
We must know the negative,(the neeegative)
To recognize the positive (recognize the positive)
We must know the positive,(the pooositive)
To recognize the negative (it's all relative, its all relative)[Hook: Hell Razah]

Aiyo peep it, I build like the pyramids of Egypt
Born October the first, it was an eclipse
Sittin' in the back of the Caddy with my daddy
Raised off of Curtis, Al Green and Barry
We came from the alleys to buildin' at rallies
Now we see unity from Brooklyn to Cali
I walk through the Valley of Death
Y'all better go and carry a vest
Cuz ain't no batteries left
I'm possesed by the spirits sometimes I'm Malcolm X
I confessed to the church and reversed the bomb threat
Bring the war to the Pentagon, I'll polly on in Babylon
They make hits like Barry Bonds
I drop jewels like Fahrakkhan
Y'all niggas only shine when them lights and cameras on
A Renaissance Child is gone, say "Shalom"
Open my palm and read "I'm a prophet of God"...

Rock spot veterans, plot upon medicine
Spot for our benefit, why God invented it
Fifty four seventeen Farington, moms rented it
Listen close for those that cannot remember it
Two bench room formin' in the project teniment
Mad beef everyday, even my grandma represent
Everyready cuz the PJ's is like startin' a race
Five minutes late, step up the pace
It ain't about where you from it's where you goin'
But that don't mean that you should turn your back on where you came from
Homey, digital mastered, first time on DVD
Critically acclaimed, my words rhyme on TV screens
Perfectly, scientifically, inertly
My verses speak mercilessly, manifestation of eternity
First degree surges move, mercenaries use serpent juice
Curse the youth, burn the truth, churches or schools
Goverments or army, Commy's fast versus Nazi's
Coke dealers, co-D's, it's Dhali Lama's or Swami's
Grip some produce at swap meets, gangstafied hip-hop beats
Brought by the El Dorados in Jeeps
Overseas we're top models and freaks
We pop bottles and grease
Hopin' we be promised tomorrow at least

Smell the endo, music blare out the windows
The beats reign, peep fools that stare at my skintone
Child of the eighties, crack and Reagenomics
Wild as a baby, I'm back to pay homage
Scarlets and windows, all the truth of my neighbors
Front of New Yig's bodegga was the fruits of my labor
The movers and fakers, justifyin' the blocks
Bunch of losers and faggots in disguise with the cops
The arrival of Watts and Bedstuy embracin'
The economy shot, red eyes and made men
Interrogation, evil, the trojan ain't protected by the nation of the people
Buildin' schools they neglected
A message from the Kings and Queens, Gods and Goddesses
Aggressive in the scheme of things, heart of Spartacus
Regardless if life ain't right or lookin' easy
Creativity grows in Brooklyn, believe me

[Hook x2][Verse 1]
Yeah... Necro on the beat, check it, yo
We live like the city of gods fallen angels
We call it painful, memories of murdering death often against truth
I came through for money and power despite feds stalking
Cruise through the 25th hour like Ed Norton
Ported the world, the poisonous spiders feting this nature
Suck the blood from your soul, control the deadliest states
It takes a nation of million to hold me back, I take aim
At these fake cats who intercedes name and vain
I make change in the lives of the listeners, your innocence
Gets coped as I'm spitting this a lively in the businesses
Ridiculous addictiveness the game is sold deeper
Sabac the coalition can you keynote speaker
I'm the truth, notice what I spit on my records
Revolution is for soldiers and the soldiers connected
I'm protected by god so fuck your squad out to get me
Stand up or fall hard, if you ain't with me you against me

[Hook]
Sabac - I speak militant - They only talking cause I live it
Sabac - I speak militant - I want some freedom by the thugshit
Sabac - I speak militant - They only talking cause I live it
Rap-gentles - best in the fucking country
I want some freedom by the thugshit

[Verse 2]
They got weapon of mass destruction, buttons explode the earth
Disintegrating your flesh you won't even know it hurts
The worse are addictions from nicotine to caffeine
The food supplying injected with poison affecting the spleen
Cream and old cars, murder by numbers [?]
Full of gunmen a hundred miles and running
The coming of god, Satan's upon us waiting to bomb us
Turn us to stardust blow our ashes in the ocean
Hoping for peace, folks on their knees
Pray for forgiveness within this paranormal world
I choose to study mystics, bloody statistics
Papers are ice as the ancient Christ
Like the souls going to church give up the priceless control
Life's a cold world heated by evil and world-demonics
Blow erotics, twenty three, they never sided to call it the cosmics
Psychotic energy got my enemies plotting a penalty
To keep me trapped and locked in penitentiary
They mention me sublimely projected on the everdee
It will be a cold day in hell before they killing me
Willingly, I leave my example, fight for the people with ability
To see you we dare you that draws day beats you

[Hook]
Sabac - I speak militant - They only talking cause I live it
Sabac - I speak militant - I want some freedom by the thugshit
Sabac - I speak militant - They only talking cause I live it
Rap-gentles - best in the fucking country
I want some freedom by the thugshit[Verse 1]

The militant’s back, I took time for transition
I made it past the decline of Non Phixion
I’m a warrior hunting for change
Mainstream’s overrated man, fuck the fame
I’m for the people from all walks of life
Specifically poor people who are forced to fight
You think I’m soft and light because I work with the youth?
Some of these kids I work with be the first to shoot
They’re iller than you, in the streets killing the blues
I teach them one step at a time, they’re filling my shoes
It’s the rules of a leader, trouble and pain
In pursuit of a teacher who struggled and gained
We go from pimps to prophets, liars to logic
Zoo to drug abusers, survivors of the projects
My mind sets to clarity, predicting me well
A sign past the tragedy, commitment to self

[Hook]

I will live my life full of conscious
I’ll be the god amongst monsters
I’ll exercise more often
I’ll walk my talk and keep talking

I will read more books
But won’t judge a cover based on how it looks
I will choose love not fear
And make sure my commitment stays alive this year

I will choose to eat more healthy
And won’t believe everything you tell me
I treat women with respect
And be proactive and strive for the best

I will start to drink more water
And not spend when I can’t afford to
I’ll make my message clearer
I’ll make sure my commitment goes past this year

I will

[Verse 2]

In the midst of the risk we became better people
Life is a movie, I’m a change the sequel
We owe it to ourselves, evolve out of Hell
Even for my folks behind bars in the cell
Stay well, it’s still a challenge
Reflect upon greatness, embrace it to your balance
Ultimate awareness comes from when you seek the truth
See, life is a journey, plans and patience
Know that you’re worthy, transformation
Manifestation of creation as we know it
Red’ll rip redundant abomination of culprits
The life they giving you is all subliminal
Now we must commit and take back our principles
Turn hate to satisfaction, anger into action
Greed into giving and passive into passion

[Hook][Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
It’s a burgundy bath, everybody get turned into ash
Being evil just something I made my personal task
The G36 put you in surgery fast
Everybody die regardless who first or who last
Death almost got me twice but he mercifully passed
I’ll take your face off without using surgical masks
I wouldn’t call it an ego but I’m certainly gassed
This isn’t the Desert Eagle but it certainly smash
If I don’t get money from rhyming that’s a fateful day
I might have to take it back to the kitchen like Rachael Ray
I don’t put no work in with bitches, I’m trying to scrape today
Anywhere in my environment is not the place to play
If I’m hungry in need of food I’ll pull a skully down
I don’t fuck with workers, I’m gunning whoever run the town
I got enough clips with me to spit a hundred rounds
I’m the father of Christ and y’all are just the son of clowns
I don’t think that y’all can fuck with Vinnie but let’s see
I’mma have this fucking Lama looking like Jet Li
Everybody who is anybody respects me
I’ll have you bleeding out your back like it’s a jet ski

[Hook: Ill Bill]

Motherfucker, what’s really real, really ill?
Run up on you, hit you with Israeli steel, yo we really will
Through windshields, windpipes and car seats
You die on the Belt Parkway next to Canarsie

[Verse 2: Ill Bill]
Brutal tribes indulge in slavery and human sacrifice
The shooters pack devices capable of proving lack of life
With no compassion, ratchet action, flashing, fashion
Blast for cash, assassins faster than the flash
Amass a body count, surpass the sound barrier
And shattered by the splatter, rattled you
Waking shaking sober, gats that kick back and dislocate your shoulder
Decapitate your head and chop you in half, pop you and laugh
? in gas find you amongst the cowards and fags
Find me holding the rifle on the watchtower with plans
So never underestimate me or the power of Paz
Lock you in the room with the lion, now how would you last?
You can’t fight the king of the jungle, he’ll devour you fast
Put you underneath the dirt next to the flowers and grass
At the funeral mommas and dads get showered with gats
You kill one us and we’ll kill one of you, counterattack
Thousands of stacks from hustling these powders and cracks

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Reef The Lost Cauze]
I fucking pick and peel your chain, Official Pistol Gang
From Kill Devil Hills to Pennsylvain we be gripping change
You little pencil brains, before I lose to you
I’ll cut my nuts and slit my veins, all y’all do is bitch complain
Henny and pills, plenty of steel
On the block with fifties and krill word to Vinnie and Bill
In South Philly for real, my hood is guineas and Campbells
Niggas and dirty Irish who think that they SAMCRO
And oh my fan know the stream, fuck the man yo
No book em, Danno, you ain’t Rambo
Don’t put twenty in your hand bone when my fam roam
That’s when the grams go, soft white, my niggas call it that damn snow
And fuck hip hop, I got sick pot in ziplocks
I get from stoners in Cali rocking flip flops
One brand is called Sit-Stop cause after one hit
That bitch’ll have you dancing with the stars like Rick Fox

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Sabac]
Yo we have walked back together to gorillas and wolves
The illest of goons, the room is filled with killers and booze
Pretty soon we breaking in your office building with tools
Assassinate the CEO for catching feelings and moods
The steel at the moon got us raising hell on the block
If they manipulate us like a pretty face and smelly twat
Tell me what is power, cash, hand, guns, and hoorah
A brutal task between thieves, priests, nuns and Korans
I’m on a path that has the cash, has bigger and better things
I’ve been with veteran medicine men headed to Medellin
Bring the noise and avoid the vicious cycle of prison
It’s all poison, Kool G Rap, Michael Bivins
Speed of NASCAR, "rooh", Madagascar soon
Consume a rock star "ooh" Allahu Akbar "boom!"
Wounded and killed, rumours are real
Israeli steel caught your peoples in the grill, now the tomb is concealed[Hook x 2]

It’s all crime crime crime
Very murderous
The world is gore, the world is gore
It’s all crime crime crime
Very murderous

[Verse 1: Necro]

Tsunamis and commies, atomic Islamic Satanic economics
Corruption, more destruction than comets
Secret wars, sheiks with billions
Pimping children, villains pushing krillz in buildings
Limping through the street like senior citizens
The shit I seen’s iller than flickrs, killers with clips love the raw
Corporate grime born rich can warp your mind above the law
Death rap controlling brains like remote-controlled planes
Food is poison, destroy you, your colon is swollen with pain
Every second somebody’s murdered whether you heard of it or not
It happened, somebody’s clapped in the back and bodied, it’s fact
I don’t know if I’ll make it, I might grab ahold of somebody’s face and break it
I’m a case study in case you get bloody they’ll trace it
Government’s agencies, investors, asbestos
Test tubes filled with a cure for AIDS kept from the rest of us
Nuclear bombs sold to mongrels for gluttonous profit
They flip the opposite, aim it at us and push the button

[Hook x 2]

[Verse 2: Ill Bill]

You get virgins in the afterlife if you kill people for God
You get a medal if you murder for the stripes and the stars
Twenty-five to life if you kill for the ice and the cars
Burn in eternal hell for designing the hydrogen bomb
The world’s a coffin, a morbid torture chamber lost in hatred
A corporation, the New World Order, the coronation
The spawn of Satan, the Skull and Bones, presidential motivations
What globals go to buy and sell out the solo nations
Third world children with flies on their faces
Nazis hiding in Argentina and obscure parts of Asia
Billion dollar corporate contract confrontations
Amongst private armies and military shake ups
Middle Eastern business and oil shake downs
A world of fast food zombies with golden arches
Carved into their brains now
They market toothpaste the same way they market war
Learn how the youth think first then brainwash them all

[Hook x 2]

[Verse 3: Sabac Red]

Pharmaceutical companies who’re in cahoots with physicians
The government profits off crime, the ?, and the prisons
They recycle your metal then they make weapons for war
They market products to the hood but don’t invest in the poor
We spend our money on clothes that some cats would even kill for
Expose their logos, they turn us into walking billboards
The water’s not protected, a lot of it is toxic
Corporations make investments so they bottle it and profit
What’s the logic of the white man that took a flight to Thailand
And bought a seven month old baby to fuck for five grand (damn)
Social security, decoy for retirement
Quarter million people killed cause we destroyed the environment
Crying Babylon, they send the bombs back to Syria
Extremely still explode from Lebanon out to Nigeria
Hearing people complain when I’m out on world tour
They in pain, who’s to blame when the world is gore?

[Hook x 4][Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]

Hey yo Sabacolypse, I brought a lot of Glocks and lots of clips
Up in the caravan with Taliban who cock the fifth
Bush ran from a war and straight ducked that
Bush wanna send me to war? I say fuck that
We war and buck back with the cannon or knife
Cause Vinnie Paz ain’t have a problem with Iran in his life
And I ain’t got a problem stabbing up your man with a spike
But I got a problem murdering a man and his wife
For some land that I ain’t never even stand in my life
For a man who couldn’t tell you what abandonment’s like
Been scammed all my life from Reaganomics to the crack war
And y’all are wondering what we run around with gats for
All I ask for is a good night’s sleep
So I pray to Allah hoping that the hood might eat
Each one teaches ones but the hood like beef
But I’m a hypocrite daddy so I pull my heat

[Hook: Sabac]

We fighting a war in the jungle of the ghetto
Your life will be gone once we hurt you with the metal
We blast at the system, bang for the streets
Urban gorillas mutherfuckers hanging the beast

We fighting a war in the jungle of the ghetto
Your life will be gone once we hurt you with the metal
We blast at the system, bang for the streets
Urban gorillas mutherfuckers hanging the beast

[Verse 2: Sabac]

We urban gorillas on the move like John Africa
We the masses that practice tactics right out of Attica
We blast at you, catch you for hostage, torture demons
For all the bleeding we must have war before freedom
Y’all fiending and loathing hopes to reach an atonement
We’ll have peace in a moment after we beat our opponents
We jonesing like Jonestown Massacre, the White Knight
Forcing suicides spike your soft drinks with cyanide
Call it payback for what you made and inflicted
We live in a world being lead by racists and bigots
We stripped the land from the natives and chose to call them Americans
Then claimed it as ours as if they forfeit inheritance
It’s evident intelligence and weapons become medicine
We’ll overthrow the devils in power and move ahead of them
We veterans from poverty, we rocking the streets
Freedom and equality come when we conquer the beast

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Q-Unique]

With the right to bear arms I’m excited to throw one
Q the urban gorilla, Brooklyn’s Mighty Joe Young
That faces the firing squad that’ll spit on three
Screaming till my death, “King Kong ain’t got s**t on me.”
I beat on my chest with the game of a Silverback
I don’t fire warning shots, take aim with a killer gat
Them peace talks and rallies will get so far
Fight the most powerful imperialists in the name of Elizam Escobar
Guerrilla warfare training camps in the projects
? climb the staircase till your heart rate progress
I spit possessed by the soul of Albizu
Lead rips through your chest till the welfare let go of my people
I was raised in the Bronx, Congo jungle
Where the Ball Busters and Zulus locked in a mondo rumble
And you could lose your gold over a Bronco fumble
And the CIA faggots interrogate your sidekick until your Tonto crumbles

[Hook][Intro: Sabac Red]

Life and death, people come and go, it’s part of our destiny

[Verse 1: Sabac Red]

You ever have someone you care about just leave your life?
Whether sudden or it’s coming and you can’t breathe right
The first time I was ten when I endured that pain
My friend’s dad was shot in front of my face, I saw brains
She was nine, she was crushed, she was mine, I had a crush
Then she moved out of state, her moms abandoned her
I knew this kid in middle school who refused to make friends
Cause his dad was military, they’d be moving again
It’s the passing of a grandparent, mom, or dad
Or a child, take advantage of the times we have
It’s divorce, it’s death, it’s the loss, regrets
But for every loss we find something more to connect
There’s a plan though we don’t always know what it is
Like my friend who got married but wifey couldn’t have kids
Then his mom passed away, we were stunned and torn
Nine months later their son was born

[Hook: Sabac Red/Jordan Battiste]

This is our destiny, what is meant to be will be
It’s out of our hands, part of the plan
Respect time we have, enjoy the show
Because people come and go
And when they go they’re missed
Whether old or kids
It’s the memories we make, it’s that ownership
It’s the unknown fear, it’s the fear we know
When our people come and go

[Verse 2: Slaine]

We’re trapped in a race against time
I guess that some of us are running slower
You never know when the Grim Reaper might be coming over
A boy watch his older brother go become a soldier
Die overseas, now he barely sees his mother sober
His father left her, he don’t know if he should love or loathe her
He wishes pops would just show up with a dozen roses
Him and cousin Joseph jumping on the fucking sofas
Screaming out the window at the city while they’re chugging sodas
Laughing, not fully grasping or grappling with truth
Smoking grass, hanging on the corner tackling their youth
Absentee parents and violence is everywhere
Chaos and loss surround them but their eyes never tear
They share private stock, bitches, Hennessy, fistfights and enemies
They share the same pain, same blood, and same memories
They was everything that was clear but wasn’t said
Till he shows up at the crib and finds his cousin dead

[Hook][Verse 1: Sick Jacken]
Street kid royalty, kings cause the loyalty
Don’t rat, don’t dime, reap what the spoils be
Hoping that the cops and the feds keep ignoring me
If they ask questions you can bet that’s when my lawyer be
Small minds checkmate, the pigs trying to get him and arrest ?
Pharmaceuticals to get my head straight
My mind open, psycho when I put the coke in
That’s why I sound a little strange when my words are spoken
Laws are broken by the token crime often
Nine times out of dimes rat chime with the square motion
And so the game’s changed from shooty range
To shooty ? to feds to paperwork that’s full of names
That’s why I’m on a solo tip cause the one-sided gun don’t flip
That’s just my new shit, though the concept of my crimey is behind me
You can still find me in the presence of a sick army

[Hook]
Do I gotta play the role just to be liked?
Get yours, I’mma get mine
That’s why I write the shit I write in my raps
You know how we think, I’mma get mine
Rap, hip hop, underground, mainstream
Get yours, I’mma get mine
That’s why I write the shit I write my raps
You know how we think, I’mma get mine

[Verse 2: Slaine]
I paint a picture of the streets, heroin fiends and thieves
With rotted teeth in the alleys when they spotted police
I’m the rowdy cry of addiction and the voice of despair
Like the hope that burns inside em, put the noise in his ear
Like beside him full of poison with his boys out of lock up
Riding beside him, riding and dying hard in the iron
I’m the poster child for white America gone wrong
Before you figure me out I’m long gone
They call me Slaine cause I speak through the dying eyes of a wise soul
That cries cold through each story that I’ve told
Crafted in my fabric, I’m not just rapping to music
Apparently what’s happened: I have captured a movement
Splashing the absolute juice through intrusive truths
I’m the old fashioned new sense of a nuisance’s noose
They’re calling out for help from the heart of the youthless youth
That’s what happens when you stop just doing you for you

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sabac Red
I’m all about the people and progression, porn flicks and politics
A lot of it’s ironic, got a long list of followers
With silencers attached, they shoot up the house
It’s pure chaos like the cover of The Future Is Now
My goons move in a crowd keep it under control
Then BP your bitch, feed her things and plug up her holes
At my shows grown folks throw their sets in the air
I’ve been with fans smoke boges, drink Mexican beer
Al-Jahir, Al-Jihad, do you believe in the god?
I’m aware I strand somewhere between the seas and the stars
Police in their cars playing games of evens and odds
And creep in the yard, now you leaving bleeding with scars
I speak these bars to escape it, fuck the fake shit
I hate it, I wanna shapeshift that digging in a crate shit
My patience and kindness turned hatred to violence
I pray for the day we read sacred environments

[Hook][Intro]
I want the young motherfuckers in here tonight
No matter what your nationality is
Turn the motherfucking TV off for one week
And see if you can survive


[Verse 1]

Click, Click
You've been brought in to the tube
The message gets projected that alters your mood
An infectious deathwish right in front of your face
Glorification of tanks, bombs, guns and grenades
Call of Duty: Black Opses, military control
Not the game but how they engauge you to enroll
Reality shows influence hatin' the boss
Contradicting programs, food challenge, weight loss
Exploitation of blacks, fights posted on the Internet
Binary codes now promote smoking cigarettes
Trick-knowledgy but the knowledge is trick
So you buy bigger things to compromise for your dick
Plastic surgeons, fake tits, strips to racist themes
Sex addiction, cocaine, we host a place for fiends
Sixteen pregnant gang wars, rapists and crime
Lose control, die, LCD raping our minds

[Verse 2]

It's a media brain trap
We became slaves to the screen
Corporations run stations on the station we see
Odd attention into poverty, the threat in economy
The pressure of providing with the message of autonomy
Suicide, murder, drug dealing police
Pill poppers, prostitutes, what's real in the streets
It's the beef, the conflict, the overload of aggression
It's the power struggle leading to the mode of depression
We love the entertainment when the cameras go up
Millionaire aspirations in the bad girls club
Cops 'n' robbers, mobsters, we're stable for days
Can't afford a decent meal but the cable is paid
It's more than Big Brother, this is brain control
Deleted emails are saved on a station in Rome
The Kinect for Xbox scans your body for heat
It sends rays through your brain til your body's diseased

[Outro]
It's called "tell a vision" programming
They tellin' you visions being programmed. You bein' programmed
You watch it on the news, 'It was on CNN, it's true. I seen it on FOX, it's real.' It's BULLSHIT![Verse 1: I'll Bill]
Listen to Art Bell, Cookie Puss like Carvel
Bulletproof like Luca age 12 Marvel
Bohemian Grove speaking Elohimian code
Under the table sale of reptilian skulls
Sherm, purple pill, word to Bill, murder guild, burn your face
Burger grill meatloaf head Gucci and cokeheads
A Lopez wannabe, Scarface operated
Another Scarface incarcerated
He said dude, bro, had a jew fro, looked like Tony Kukoc
High glucose and blood sugar drug boogers
Trouble shooters, double Grey Goose
Trey deuce in the bubble goose
Hundred proof, who the fuck are you?
Came through with a Brooklyn face
Jordan started [?] to crooked taste
Blew a whole in the wall and took the safe
Got knocked, got a nose job and blew the case
Then knocked again cause after surgery he looked the same

[Hook:]
Easy to tell, fuck with me and I will see you in Hell
The unfuckwithable, the uncrushable
There ain't no stopping the unstoppable

Easy to tell, fuck with me and I will see you in Hell
The unfuckwithable, the uncrushable
There ain't no stopping the unstoppable

[Verse 2: Sicknature]
They tell him break a leg so he can start off on the wrong foot
And go stomping toward the coffin coughing the wrong hook
Loosen his numerals son of [?]
While the industrial tumors grow
The whole fucking world is a Truman Show
A true to first like I'm fucking smacking your Tonka
They come with war tech, they're smarter than Hannibal Barca
Personality sniper strikes till every bastard is lifeless
The newest fancy gadgets, using tracking devices
They be sniffing your route when you chill on a couch
They planted shit in your house claiming that you dipping your snout
But the law points fingers from the villains it's out
Every third pig is using bricks when building his house
A rough world, nobody's staged and accidents happen global
From the fucking Titanic to the factories in Chernobyl
But you keep standing firm so keep turning it louder
Keep banging your head so your cranium turn into powder
He's uncrushable

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sabac Red]
I do dirt then wash my hands with the water of Satan
Reverse the roles and merge the souls, see the god in it's making
Shaking exorcism mathematics science and pagans awaiting death
While life is lived in the lines of the pavements
Creating off seeds, we all bleed and thirst for blood
Invading [?], chasing dreams facing curse of love
It's kinda bugged when your affection doesn't match your intentions
And attention that you gain is only based on when you're mentioned
Dreading Armageddon I'm forgetting all of the rules
Possessed by pussy greedy drugs and never letting them lose
Cruise ships got surveillance when we vacate with the aliens
And share notes and Ambien the State we're preparing them
Be wary of their lies and deceitful truths
The scary minds are the wise and streets is proof
We move fast and try to last for the rest of the way
Because tomorrow should better than yesterday's todayDoes anyone know these lyrics?
