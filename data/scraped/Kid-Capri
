[Verse 1: Big L]
Aiyyo, you betta flee hops, or get your head flown three blocks
L keep rappers' hearts pumping like Reeboks
And every year I gain clout and my name sprouts
Some brothers'd still be virgins if the crack never came out
I got the wild style, always been a foul child
My guns go BOOM BOOM, and yo' guns go pow-pow
I'm known to have a hottie open, I keep the shottie smoking
Front and get half the bones in your body broken
And when it comes to getting nookie I'm not a rookie
I got girls that make that chick Toni Braxton look like Whoopi
I run with sturdy cliques I'm never hittin' dirty chicks
Got thirty-five bodies, buddy don't make it thirty-six
Step to this you're good as gone, word is bond
I leave mics torn when I put it on

[Hook: Kid Capri]
So put it on Big L, put it on
C'mon put it onnn, and onnn, and onnn
C'mon put it on Big L, put it on
C'mon put it on represent put it on, C'MON!

[Verse 2: Big L]
Nobody can take nothing from Big L but a loss chief
The last punk who fronted got a mouth full of false teeth
I'm known to gas a hottie and blast the shottie
Got more cash than Gotti, you don't know, you better ask somebody
Big L is a crazy brother, and I'm a lady lover
A smooth kid that'll run up in your baby mother
I push a slick Benz, I'm known to hit skins
And get ends and commit sins with sick friends
Cause I'm a money getter, also a honey hitter
You think you nice as me? Ha ha, you'se a funny nigga
I flows so one of my shows, wouldn't be clever to miss
I'm leaving competitors pissed
To tell you the truth, it gets no better than this
I'm catching wreck to the break of dawn
In this song, yo it's a must that I put it on

[Hook: Kid Capri]

[Bridge: Patois Chatta]
Some boys see me gun nozzle and take a we fi joke
Boy you gwan dead before you see me gun smoke
See me gun nozzle and take me fi joke
You gwan dead, from a me you provoke

[Verse 3: Big L]
I drink Moet not Beck's beer, I stay dressed in slick gear
Peace to my homies in the gangster lean I see you when I get there
And it's a fact I keep a gat in my arm reach
I charm freaks and bomb geeks from here to Palm Beach
I'm putting rappers in the wheelchair
Big L is the villain you still fear
Cause I be hanging in Harlem and shit is for real here
If you battle L you picked the wrong head
I smash mics like cornbread, you can't kill me I was born dead
And I'm known to pull steel trigs and kill pigs
I run with ill kids and real nigs who peel wigs
My rap's steady slamming, I keep a heavy cannon
It's a new sheriff in town, and it ain't Reggie Hammond
Peace to my peoples, the Children of the Corn
Cause we put it on, adi√≥s, ghost I'm gone[Intro: Troy Ave]
Had to change the names to protect the rights of the innocent
Had to go Law & Order on em'
Hun'eds, hun'eds in my pocket, keep it G
All day, everyday, real life, this is me
Got the streets on lock, you ain't blind, you can see
Your boy Troy Ave and the Kid Capri

[Hook: Troy Ave]
She said that she don't want me cause I'm just another dealer
Heard some niggas overtalkin' and they said I was a killer
Plus you know I come from Brooklyn and she way up in the Bronx
I said, 'Baby, fuck you mean? I ride foreign, want you want?'

[Verse 1: Troy Ave]
Ay, yo, I met her in Astoria, stage name Gloria
Smooth skin, tanned like a vacay in Florida
She don't want to dance, she just tryin' to bring her daughter up
I went in my pants, couple bands, and that's for all of you
Bitches wit' ambition, he just in the kitchen
Him bein' me, dark skin, jewels glistenin', right?
And, baby, this your lucky night
Fuck wit' the Kid, roll wit' me like a pair of dice
Trips, see low clouds on the plane
So fly, so high, take a hit of Mary Jane
It's a PJ, it just came from VA
Hampton University, seven plus three K
That's a dime, you a dime, I shine, you could shine
Them other niggas want yours, I just want you to be mine
You sip birthday cake wine, I'm a part of that
I could show you where love and the dollars at

[Hook: Troy Ave]
She said that she don't want me cause I'm just another dealer
Heard some niggas overtalkin' and they said I was a killer
Plus you know I come from Brooklyn and she way up in the Bronx
I said, 'Baby, fuck you mean? I ride foreign, want you want?'

[Verse 2: Troy Ave]
Party dumb, more fun, still kickin' game
It's really just extra, she already know the name
I spoke my peace, out the door, capisce
Hit the alarm, doors open, nah, I don't lease
Paid in full, new bands, baby, fuck your friends
Them hoes'd leave you if they could get wit' me
And I don't really want people in my business
Whether it's streets or the sheets, that's how you get a sentence
I'm a give you time, be careful how you spend it
Whole lot to comma, I base run and no penny
Batter up, little bitch bad as fuck
You made a good choice, let me snatch her up
They say one loyal girl is hard to find
So when you get her, keep her wit' it, to the top you come
Rocky road, rock and roll, heavy metal for (-)
They don't want to step up and shine, motherfuckers

[Hook: Troy Ave]
She said that she don't want me cause I'm just another dealer
Heard some niggas overtalkin' and they said I was a killer
Plus you know I come from Brooklyn and she way up in the Bronx
I said, 'Baby, fuck you mean? I ride foreign, want you want?'

[Outro]
I mean shit you know how that go, don't nothing last forever
The way you living is killing them
Best believe its gonna come to an end
I tell it like this, All I got a lot of money and a little bit of time
So you gonna take it or leave it for the next bitch?[Verse 1]
As a young'un dumb and, gun in the waist
Sold crack to those who couldn't take the pain
And had to numb it with base
Couldn't drink the Henny straight, I needed somethin to chase
Nowadays I throw shots back, leavin nothin to waste
Life's like a treadmill, niggas runnin in place
Gettin nowhere fast, a whole year done past
I vowed to never stop winnin, 'til the earth stop spinnin
Rock hot linen, cop hot cars and hot women
If it's not him then you got it confused, y'all not rememberin
My motto is simply I will not lose
Abide by the block rules, I buy my Glocks used
Wit bodies on it, let me know anybody want it?
I'm raised, illrational, way misunderstood
If you ain't live like I live, been one with the hood
I done what I could, to come up with this paper 'til this day still
Run with the hood, guess it's part of my nature
If hell awaits a, nigga I'm comin with the razors
Still flashin ya shit, try to pass me in a six
Type classy on the wrists, every bit of 30 karats
This is, not a game this is not why I came
May these words find a spot on your brain and burn
Then I recycle my life I shall return

[Hook]
[Woman] How tight is your flow?
[Jay-Z] Cause I'm like that yo
[Woman] How right is your dough?
[Jay-Z] Cause I'm like that yo
[Woman] How white is your blow?
[Jay-Z] Cause I'm like that yo
[Woman] Only, write what you know
[Jay-Z] Cause I'm like that

[Verse 2]
I'm a hop skip and a jump from grippin the pump
Spittin a couple of curse words, and hittin you chump
Shit, I get digits in lumps
I'm a motherfuckin problem, is this what you want?
Overachiever, I love chicks that puff cheeba in reefer paper
I hate the ones that blow up ya beeper
Cause I, go inta deeper, I only bone divas
Impregnate the world when I cum through your speakers (ha ha)
Fuck hot, my records got the fever
Niggas kick dirt, get ya whole block sweeped up
I creep up when the beef heats up
Caught him with his feet up and shoes off, bout to snooze off
Hatin, cause you can't turn the booze off
You dudes is too soft, why I don't fuck with you all
I might bark with X, or spit at the Lox
But, other than that, I don't be fuckin with cats
Just me Ty and B-High, thug it like that
E, Dame and Biggs, what's fuckin with that?
Y'all can never diss Jigga, get nothin for that
Other than a couple of slugs in ya back (huh huh)
Rappers y'all, runnin around like I won't gun ya down
Last nigga that fronted, two shots spun him around
Lord, accept this offerin here's somethin for your crown
I meant no malice, I just met his challenge and won[Intro: 'The River Wild' sample]
"Where are you?" "Hey, there you are!"
"How does it feel to know you only have a few more seconds left to live?"

[Big L]
I stay jeweled up, pockets swelled up from banks I held up
Plenty bitch-ass niggas Big L stuck
I never catch cold feet when I hold heat
We roll deep in a triple black dark tinted old jeep
I catch a fag three o'clock in the morn
On the block all alone and put a Glock to his dome
Tell him, "Give it up quick, you nitwit, don't try to get slick
Or I'm a let this four-fifth spit and leave your shit split"
Grip, it ain't nothing decent about me
A true thug for real, you can ask the precinct about me
A rap junkie, don't try to play me like some flunky
Jewels be chunky, pockets lumpy, attitude grumpy
Mad niggas be fronting a lot
Popping mad shit, tryna be something they not
Your faggot ass better stick to dancing, don't even look at me
I might break your jaw just for glancing, that's right
In '97 Harlem kids is blowing
And we don't trick, we'll let a bitch starve till her ribs are showing

Ain't no barbecue, niggas better stop tryna grill me
Huh, sent that style to the essence
Got niggas stressing my style, pull like fluorescents
No question, tough type to clutch mics

Expose the facts, you know the haps
Could go to laugh astrological, like the signs in the Zodiac
Your rap crew out the stack loop, word up
My style's tighter than a fat bitch in a cat suit

Mad hard like the S.A.T. who have shorties
Caught up in the mental, watch her bless A.G

Thought you was the boss when your fat thoughts were empty
Not Fat Joey Crack but still Jealous One's Envy
Who sent me? D.I.T.C., good and plenty

But I don't play that shit with no chicks
Sucking the next nigga's dick, moving bricks
I'm too slick for you high school dropouts
You got knocked and tried to cop out
Couldn't fight when the kids pulled the mop out
And wails you out, writing home saying, "Bail me out"

Heal yourself, you got to heal yourself
Heal yourself, ooohhh

[Kid Capri talks]

[Verse 1: Big Daddy Kane]
Mama said don't do crack and smoke you know
Cause it will make your nose grow like Pinocchio
Since I was only 15 I had to listen
To what was said for my parent was a christian
I went to school and saw all my friends do it
But I said no cause I don't want my nose to grow
They started tripping on me, busting and flipping on me
So I had to front and say yo, true, stick it on me
I started smoking to prove I'm an adult
Now it's a habit but is it all my fault
I wished my mother would have told me the truth
Cause now I'm all based out, ma dukes

[Kid Capri]
Oh man I like the way that's going down
Now why won't you do is kick a little Freddie Foxx

[Verse 2: Freddie Foxxx]
Everybody rise as I present to a jet black crowd
What it's like to be black and proud
In a world where white is right but not tonight
This is a black man's might
I heard a sister say she don't like darker shades of black
On a man cause that's whack
But to my light skin sister can't you tell
You're just the surface of a dark deep well
And how can you prefer to be wit those
That sprayed you wit gun and hoses
And never put roses on the graves
Of the slaves that they treated like dirt
After all that hard work

[Kid Capri]
Clap your hands to the beat, C'mon, just clap your hands to the beat
Freak it now

[Verse 3: LL Cool J]
One of the biggest lies you hear from no one else
Is when a girl tries to say she don't do it to herself
Always fantasizing but steadily denying
Last night she had to stop cause her baby was crying
She do it on the phone all alone wit a smile
Run the water, grab the shower cap and get buckwild
Soap suds on the floor, oh Al B Sure
Give it to me, give it to me, give me a little more
I'm fiending, creaming, screaming, dreaming (what else)
The girl's possessed by the basehead demon

[Hook: Harmony]

[Verse 4: MC Lyte]
In Elementary, Lyte had the Jordache look
Like me and any other kid who cared about books
But then I got wise and I begin to listen
To the whack teachers and the wick-wack system
My mother put me in Weusi Shule
Which means black school in Swahili
And there is where I learned black history
And how to be the best that I can be
I went back and now the school is closed
There is nowhere for black youth to go
To be taught by brothers and sisters who knows what it means
To be a black child or a white teen
In the end the youth is being mistreated
Which means the world is being cheated

[Verse 5: Queen Latifah]
Dane was never taught her life was worth something
But when people don't try to improve it makes me want to hurt something
You want to be somebody and be a standout
But got your handout, oh you're broke, I guess it's off to your man's house
Why is sister's giving up the ball
Today it seems not to father you too hard
They call us squeezers and you prove it to the worst
You have to earn the right to say it's ladies first

[Kid Capri]
Oh man this is Human Education Against Lies
You better know the flavor kid

[Verse 6: KRS-One]
Human Education Against Lies tries
To open the eyes of humanity before it dies
Black and white ain't the real fight
That's the only thing the media hypes
The real fight are these major corporations
Holding back on real education
Before you're a color, first you're human
Teaching humanity is what we're doing

[Kid Capri]
And just when you thought you knew everything there was to know
You didn't know anything about this, tell 'em Melodie

[Verse 7: Ms Melodie]
Daddy's home everyday since he lost his job
His new line of work is now beating up mom
Mom is scared, she doesn't know what to do
Her beautiful skin is now black and blue
She used to cry, now she's back in the pen
A human war between women and men

[Kid Capri]
Melodie, Kid Capri

[Verse 8: Jam Master Jay and DMC]
Jam jay on the way, yo
Human Education Against Lies
To all the girls and to all the guys
Get paid, get it made
Get a good grade, live to a very old age
Checking out jet, no disrespect
To each and every member of the opposite sexes
Is yes, listen to the messages and I send some
We never knew where the poison came from
Yo, we're rapping on H.E.A.L. so we thought we like to mention
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome
AIDS, we're here to make you get wise
Human Education Against Lies

[Kid Capri talks][Intro/Hook: Heavy D, (Vinia Mojica)]
I got nothing but love for you, baby {Uh-huh}
I got nothing but love for you, honey {Yeah, whatever}
I got nothing but love for you, baby {What you got?}
I got nothing but love for you, honey {Yeah, whatever} (What's yours is mine)
I got nothing but love for you, baby {Uh-huh} (What's mine is mine)
I got nothing but love for you, honey {Yeah, whatever} (What's yours is mine)
I got nothing but love for you, baby {What ya got} (What's mine is mine)
I got nothing but love for you, honey {Yeah, whatever} (What's yours is mine)
I got nothing but love for you, baby {Uh-huh} (What's mine is mine)
I got nothing but love for you, honey {Yeah, whatever}

[Verse 1: Heavy D]
I know you want lots a jewels and stuff
Backyards with swimming pools, bar with stools and stuff
Fancy foods, Lobster, Sushi
Gear, Versace, Gucci, crazy Lucci
I know your M.O., you do demo on a paycheck
You get hair from the barber, show him no respect
Middle name "Price Tag", first name "Got You"
Start a scope, got on a roll, now they can't stop you
Talking about "hey Boo, how you do
Some clown uptown said you ran through his crew
I give you props and credit cause it's due
But I ain't that clown, and my crew ain't that crew
Time's too hard to be faking like I'm dating on some steak
And.. wining and dining, I ain't choking on no chicken
Leave it up to me I'll close the whole damn store on you
I got nothing but love for you (What's yours is mine)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Heavy D]
I'm not your H-E-L-P, but I'm your H-E-A-V-Y DASH-D
Don't test me, don't ask me for nothing
For nathins, for just, for doodle lee squat, you can do me not
You plan on plot on who be hot and trying to hit the slot
I know your low pro style, your low whole pro vibe
Kick a bother in the gut and then you smile
I must admit; I really dig your operation
Every time we on the phone, you got the sexy conversation
So now you hope to be the woman of my dream
And while I'm sleeping, you'll be creeping, robbing me clean
I see you hanging on the corners with the rest of your girl crew
Standing by the gutter with your booty cutters
Said who's the honey dip, down with the money grip
Always got a plan and a scam to get some money quick
Always get with the next man, the one with the checks
And setting up a trap with the sexing (What's yours is mine)

[Hook]

[Hook: Heavy D]
From the brother, from the brother, this the champion - [X8]

[Verse 3: Heavy D]
You give me feelings like I'm dealing with a crooked hand
You got a grand from a man cause you shook his hand
You're well known in the streets, in the gutters
So fly, when you caught my eye, you made me stutter
You come around with your curls and your pretty pearls
You even been around the world, so you go, girl
But where's the love at? tell me where's the hugs at?
Acting like a Rugrat, I know where you bought that
Don't try to gas me, girl, I know the streets well
You're money hungry and you're making trick-n-treats sell
So leave it up to me, I'll close the whole damn store on you
I got nothing but love for you (What's yours is mine)

Any man that drop the lyric what we give them the BO
Brown skin woman you a queen and not a HOE
Any man that drop the lyric what we give them the BO

Verse One:

We don't come with disrespect, we come with intellect
If you come with disrespect you get a rope around your neck
Some people don't expect me, to be so violent
But me NAH violent, just myself I protect
Too many time I see, young gwal pickadee
Pay five ten twenty thirty dollar to see
Some rapper some singer some .. celebrity
Talk bout they wan fi sex up and fill up you body
But them NAH talk about peelin off some money
For the pumpin onna bed, when you haf the baby
Whattaya think can happen next? After you're done havin sex?
Too much of ignorance, not enough intellence
Mahn me NOT against sex, but too many DJ
Talk sex but them not talk about the next day
Cause the next day them gone, and you sit alone
Got em soup up your mic, pon de micraphone

Chorus (w/ minor variations)

Verse Two:

Brown skin gwal them can't diss yo
Cause you run the show-ow-ow!

White, man knew dat, and dat was a shock
So dem whip up your bod', and dem whippin not stop
But dem NAH can't stop us wit de whip and de chain
So dem take away your history, erase your name
STILL, with no name, with no fight, with no fuss
We just, take on the name, that MASSA give us
That name is NI-GGA, the correct is NE-GRO
It's spa-nish for BLACK, white mahn call us DAT
There is also NE-GROID, also NE-GRO
Now, all nigga pon the corner playin cee-lo
Man you're not a ne-gro, cause you're skin is not black
Take a look at yourself, you're brown and that's a fact
You not jump from no tree, you not live in no cave

You a African man, some say Asian
You must respect your love, all brown skin 'oman!
If you diss your 'oman, you not come wit no plan
So shut up your mowf, til you must understand!

Chorus (w/ minor variations)

Had to go Law & Order on em'
Hun'eds, hun'eds in my pocket, keep it G
All day, everyday, real life, this is me
Got the streets on lock, you ain't blind, you can see
Your boy Troy Ave and the Kid Capri

[Hook: Troy Ave]
She said that she don't want me cause I'm just another dealer
Heard some niggas overtalkin' and they said I was a killer
Plus you know I come from Brooklyn and she way up in the Bronx
I said, 'Baby, fuck you mean? I ride foreign, want you want?'

[Verse 1: Troy Ave]
Ay, yo, I met her in Astoria, stage name Gloria
Smooth skin, tanned like a vacay in Florida
She don't want to dance, she just tryin' to bring her daughter up
I went in my pants, couple bands, and that's for all of you
Bitches wit' ambition, he just in the kitchen
Him bein' me, dark skin, jewels glistenin', right?
And, baby, this your lucky night
Fuck wit' the Kid, roll wit' me like a pair of dice
Trips, see low clouds on the plane
So fly, so high, take a hit of Mary Jane
It's a PJ, it just came from VA
Hampton University, seven plus three K
That's a dime, you a dime, I shine, you could shine
Them other niggas want yours, I just want you to be mine
You sip birthday cake wine, I'm a part of that
I could show you where love and the dollars at

[Hook: Troy Ave]
She said that she don't want me cause I'm just another dealer
Heard some niggas overtalkin' and they said I was a killer
Plus you know I come from Brooklyn and she way up in the Bronx
I said, 'Baby, fuck you mean? I ride foreign, want you want?'

[Verse 2: Troy Ave]
Party dumb, more fun, still kickin' game
It's really just extra, she already know the name
I spoke my peace, out the door, capisce
Hit the alarm, doors open, nah, I don't lease
Paid in full, new bands, baby, fuck your friends
Them hoes'd leave you if they could get wit' me
And I don't really want people in my business
Whether it's streets or the sheets, that's how you get a sentence
I'm a give you time, be careful how you spend it
Whole lot to comma, I base run and no penny
Batter up, little bitch bad as fuck
You made a good choice, let me snatch her up
They say one loyal girl is hard to find
So when you get her, keep her wit' it, to the top you come
Rocky road, rock and roll, heavy metal for (-)
They don't want to step up and shine, motherfuckers

[Hook: Troy Ave]
She said that she don't want me cause I'm just another dealer
Heard some niggas overtalkin' and they said I was a killer
Plus you know I come from Brooklyn and she way up in the Bronx
I said, 'Baby, fuck you mean? I ride foreign, want you want?'

[Outro]
I mean shit you know how that go, don't nothing last forever
The way you living is killing them
Best believe its gonna come to an end
I tell it like this, All I got a lot of money and a little bit of time
So you gonna take it or leave it for the next bitch?"I'd like to know.. are you really ready for some super dynamite soul?
	 Then thank you, because now, it's star time!"

The Apollo (4X)

[Kid Capri]
The Apollo a place, where performers perform
Before you got on the stage you would all be warned
About if you're good enough, to rock the place
But if you wasn't they would throw beer cans in your face
Well it was a, amateur night, a group dressed in white
Didn't think it was spectacular but they were alright
Kept sayin to myself, I wish it was me
That was on the stage doin my R-A-P
Well uh, anyway we go back to the days
When James Brown used to have, the crowd amazed
He used to come out, dancin, just doin his work
And when he screamed, all the ladies went bezerk
Slidin across the stage like he was runnin on oil
Shoes, shinin bright like aluminum foil
Women was fallin out, innocent to ?
He said, "PLEASE PLEASE" then started rappin
You only seen one show you couldn't stay to see another
Of the singin Godfather Number One Soul Brother
Events like this happened all the time
At the place that was known to be, one of a kind
It's The Apollo

The Apollo (4X)
[Kid]	It's the Apollo!
The Apollo (3X)
The Ap..

[Kid Capri]
The Apollo yes a legend in it's time
The place is so fly that I wish it was mine
I mean the line was so long but people did not care
Just as long as they knew, they could get in there
On Wednesday's, amateur night was cool
And you could, go to see what other artists could do
Nothin but black stars, risin to the top
Now you see what's takin over, we call it hip-hop
The Apollo, no other, could ever compete
When you look down and I see people movin their feet
When the stage used to rise all the people went nuts
And no one EVER kept their big mouth shut
They used to, scream and yell, raise a whole lot of hell
Hang off the balcony and sometimes they fell
It's a tradition, so whatta ya do?  I don't know
You get a ticket take yourself to the Apollo, hey
The Showbiz Cafe, was right next door
Leave, from the Apollo and you party some more
You can go many places to have a show
But no matter where you went you always seemed to go
To the Apollo
To the Apollo!
Uhh.. (The Apollo) .. ..
To the Apollo!
And let me break it down for you one time

Hey the A for Artist, the P for People
O for Outstanding, L - for Legal
And the other L-O is for the low-down shame
For the ones, that tried, to destroy the name
So whatever you do, you can never forget
About the place, that always kept you drippin with sweat
From dancin and prancin and jumpin up and down
Everytime you turned around a new show was in town
It's the place, that everybody would always go
And I called it, the famous Apollo
It's the Apollo
It's the Apollo! (The Apollo) UHH!

The Apollo (4X)
[Kid]	It's the Apollo, come on!
The Apollo (3X)
[Kid]	UHH!
The Apollo (2X)
[Kid]	It's the Apollo!
The Apollo (2X)

The Apollo..{Kid Capri}

KRS-One on the micraphone
Now we gonna come down ruffneck like this now seen?
Mad Lion hold tight

Chorus:

Brown skin woman, you a queen, not a HOE
Any man that drop the lyric what we give them the BO
Brown skin woman you a queen and not a HOE
Any man that drop the lyric what we give them the BO

Verse One:

We don't come with disrespect, we come with intellect
If you come with disrespect you get a rope around your neck
Some people don't expect me, to be so violent
But me NAH violent, just myself I protect
Too many time I see, young gwal pickadee
Pay five ten twenty thirty dollar to see
Some rapper some singer some .. celebrity
Talk bout they wan fi sex up and fill up you body
But them NAH talk about peelin off some money
For the pumpin onna bed, when you haf the baby
Whattaya think can happen next? After you're done havin sex?
Too much of ignorance, not enough intellence
Mahn me NOT against sex, but too many DJ
Talk sex but them not talk about the next day
Cause the next day them gone, and you sit alone
Got em soup up your mic, pon de micraphone

Chorus (w/ minor variations)

Verse Two:

Brown skin gwal them can't diss yo
Cause you run the show-ow-ow!
Them call you all type of bimbo
But you know you're not a ho-oe-oe!
Bwoy pickade, check out your history
Brown man is a God in any ci-ty
White, man knew dat, and dat was a shock
So dem whip up your bod', and dem whippin not stop
But dem NAH can't stop us wit de whip and de chain
So dem take away your history, erase your name
STILL, with no name, with no fight, with no fuss
We just, take on the name, that MASSA give us
That name is NI-GGA, the correct is NE-GRO
It's spa-nish for BLACK, white mahn call us DAT
There is also NE-GROID, also NE-GRO
Now, all nigga pon the corner playin cee-lo
Man you're not a ne-gro, cause you're skin is not black
Take a look at yourself, you're brown and that's a fact
You not jump from no tree, you not live in no cave
That's some GARBAGE dem print, dem want you to behave!
You a African man, some say Asian
You must respect your love, all brown skin 'oman!
If you diss your 'oman, you not come wit no plan
So shut up your mowf, til you must understand!

Chorus (w/ minor variations)

Outro:

Big shouts to the engineer Naughty
Big shouts to Luca, and we OUTTTTTTTTA here!

Peeeeeeeeeeace![Intro: Styles P]
I know y'all muh'fuckers think that I took long to get back at you
Not the kid
I could do this shit forever nigga

[Styles P]
This is for the junkie on the track with a monkey on his back
I feel bad cause I got him like that
This is for the G's, this is for the hustlers
Get a whip off the lot and still upgrade the muffler
Tryin to hit the block, nobody else there yet
Get it poppin with your baby mom welfare check
And I'll ring your bell, go fuck how you felt yo
Blowin on weed if it's sticky like velcro
Bounce in, bounce out, always got an ounce out
Dig in your right pocket, 20 G count out
Used to ask yourself, what you wanna do this for?
Good Jewish lawyer turn a ten to a two-to-four
You in the game cause the game is in you
Who to blame, said I never came, I know the pain is in you
I feel you, been there, I was in there
But I ain't goin back like, I ain't been there
Can't make a million behind bars
Chill in a fly car, sit in the five-star
If you think I'm preachy just check out the dialogue
I'm knockin the iPod, first class as I go through the sky loft
What?

[Interlude: Styles P]
I don't really need a hook, I got lyrics
Feel me Kid, you know?

[Styles P]
Talk in bricks and speak in the buildings
Construction, grown now, gotta think of the children
No gangsters, real ones, you know that kill the civilians
The roughest, the addicts, Japanese and Sicilians
The rule to the sign'll say, "P, did you calm down?"
Cooled out, but never ever put my arms down
Tell the boys ring the alarm now
Cops is comin, I ain't got a gun, I come with a bomb now
So hard I walk the city in the streets, see Biggie in my sleep
Then put 50 and the 20 in my leaf
I might wear somethin with logos, or dress like a hobo
Smack any rapper that showboat
Wanna battle me that's a no-no, uh-uh
Shiesty, sorta like the block you was juxed on
Please don't provoke me to shoot at
I know you vagina, and your right-hand man is a douchebag
P is on the low where the loot at
Nine in the linin of the goose coat, deuce in the bookbag
E'rybody think that I look mad
But I don't really care cause they don't think that'll look bad
Feel me!

[Outro: Styles P]
I mean I do what I do, easily
I mean I'm a lyricist
If somebody's nicer let me know
I'll be here for a minute, y'knowmsayin?
Y'all know my name, should I say it? Ha ha!
Chach, let's get the fuck outta here
I like it like this

Who could fuck with me?
I mean I ask myself this a lot
I'm cocky, I'm real cocky
COME for me boys, let's go![Kid Capri]
Ahhhhhhh yeah... without a doubt!

As we gon' get this money
We up outta here... love...[Intro]

[Hook x2: Harmony]
Heal yourself, you got to heal yourself
Heal yourself, ooohhh

[Kid Capri talks]

[Verse 1: Big Daddy Kane]
Mama said don't do crack and smoke you know
Cause it will make your nose grow like Pinocchio
Since I was only 15 I had to listen
To what was said for my parent was a christian
I went to school and saw all my friends do it
But I said no cause I don't want my nose to grow
They started tripping on me, busting and flipping on me
So I had to front and say yo, true, stick it on me
I started smoking to prove I'm an adult
Now it's a habit but is it all my fault
I wished my mother would have told me the truth
Cause now I'm all based out, ma dukes

[Kid Capri]
Oh man I like the way that's going down
Now why won't you do is kick a little Freddie Foxx

[Verse 2: Freddie Foxxx]
Everybody rise as I present to a jet black crowd
What it's like to be black and proud
In a world where white is right but not tonight
This is a black man's might
I heard a sister say she don't like darker shades of black
On a man cause that's whack
But to my light skin sister can't you tell
You're just the surface of a dark deep well
And how can you prefer to be wit those
That sprayed you wit gun and hoses
And never put roses on the graves
Of the slaves that they treated like dirt
After all that hard work

[Kid Capri]
Clap your hands to the beat, C'mon, just clap your hands to the beat
Freak it now

[Verse 3: LL Cool J]
One of the biggest lies you hear from no one else
Is when a girl tries to say she don't do it to herself
Always fantasizing but steadily denying
Last night she had to stop cause her baby was crying
She do it on the phone all alone wit a smile
Run the water, grab the shower cap and get buckwild
Soap suds on the floor, oh Al B Sure
Give it to me, give it to me, give me a little more
I'm fiending, creaming, screaming, dreaming (what else)
The girl's possessed by the basehead demon

[Hook: Harmony]

[Verse 4: MC Lyte]
In Elementary, Lyte had the Jordache look
Like me and any other kid who cared about books
But then I got wise and I begin to listen
To the whack teachers and the wick-wack system
My mother put me in Weusi Shule
Which means black school in Swahili
And there is where I learned black history
And how to be the best that I can be
I went back and now the school is closed
There is nowhere for black youth to go
To be taught by brothers and sisters who knows what it means
To be a black child or a white teen
In the end the youth is being mistreated
Which means the world is being cheated

[Verse 5: Queen Latifah]
Dane was never taught her life was worth something
But when people don't try to improve it makes me want to hurt something
You want to be somebody and be a standout
But got your handout, oh you're broke, I guess it's off to your man's house
Why is sister's giving up the ball
Today it seems not to father you too hard
They call us squeezers and you prove it to the worst
You have to earn the right to say it's ladies first

[Kid Capri]
Oh man this is Human Education Against Lies
You better know the flavor kid

[Verse 6: KRS-One]
Human Education Against Lies tries
To open the eyes of humanity before it dies
Black and white ain't the real fight
That's the only thing the media hypes
The real fight are these major corporations
Holding back on real education
Before you're a color, first you're human
Teaching humanity is what we're doing

[Kid Capri]
And just when you thought you knew everything there was to know
You didn't know anything about this, tell 'em Melodie

[Verse 7: Ms Melodie]
Daddy's home everyday since he lost his job
His new line of work is now beating up mom
Mom is scared, she doesn't know what to do
Her beautiful skin is now black and blue
She used to cry, now she's back in the pen
A human war between women and men

[Kid Capri]
Melodie, Kid Capri

[Verse 8: Jam Master Jay and DMC]
Jam jay on the way, yo
Human Education Against Lies
To all the girls and to all the guys
Get paid, get it made
Get a good grade, live to a very old age
Checking out jet, no disrespect
To each and every member of the opposite sexes
Is yes, listen to the messages and I send some
We never knew where the poison came from
Yo, we're rapping on H.E.A.L. so we thought we like to mention
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome
AIDS, we're here to make you get wise
Human Education Against Lies

[Kid Capri talks][Verse 1]
As a young'un dumb and, gun in the waist
Sold crack to those who couldn't take the pain
And had to numb it with base
Couldn't drink the Henny straight, I needed somethin to chase
Nowadays I throw shots back, leavin nothin to waste
Life's like a treadmill, niggas runnin in place
Gettin nowhere fast, a whole year done past
I vowed to never stop winnin, 'til the earth stop spinnin
Rock hot linen, cop hot cars and hot women
If it's not him then you got it confused, y'all not rememberin
My motto is simply I will not lose
Abide by the block rules, I buy my Glocks used
Wit bodies on it, let me know anybody want it?
I'm raised, illrational, way misunderstood
If you ain't live like I live, been one with the hood
I done what I could, to come up with this paper 'til this day still
Run with the hood, guess it's part of my nature
If hell awaits a, nigga I'm comin with the razors
Still flashin ya shit, try to pass me in a six
Type classy on the wrists, every bit of 30 karats
This is, not a game this is not why I came
May these words find a spot on your brain and burn
Then I recycle my life I shall return

[Hook]
[Woman] How tight is your flow?
[Jay-Z] Cause I'm like that yo
[Woman] How right is your dough?
[Jay-Z] Cause I'm like that yo
[Woman] How white is your blow?
[Jay-Z] Cause I'm like that yo
[Woman] Only, write what you know
[Jay-Z] Cause I'm like that

[Verse 2]
I'm a hop skip and a jump from grippin the pump
Spittin a couple of curse words, and hittin you chump
Shit, I get digits in lumps
I'm a motherfuckin problem, is this what you want?
Overachiever, I love chicks that puff cheeba in reefer paper
I hate the ones that blow up ya beeper
Cause I, go inta deeper, I only bone divas
Impregnate the world when I cum through your speakers (ha ha)
Fuck hot, my records got the fever
Niggas kick dirt, get ya whole block sweeped up
I creep up when the beef heats up
Caught him with his feet up and shoes off, bout to snooze off
Hatin, cause you can't turn the booze off
You dudes is too soft, why I don't fuck with you all
I might bark with X, or spit at the Lox
But, other than that, I don't be fuckin with cats
Just me Ty and B-High, thug it like that
E, Dame and Biggs, what's fuckin with that?
Y'all can never diss Jigga, get nothin for that
Other than a couple of slugs in ya back (huh huh)
Rappers y'all, runnin around like I won't gun ya down
Last nigga that fronted, two shots spun him around
Lord, accept this offerin here's somethin for your crown
I meant no malice, I just met his challenge and won(Rich Nice - talking)
Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Rich Nice
And on behalf of Trackmasters Entertainment
I would like to welcome you to the Kid Capri
Soundtrack to the Streets album
We have so many entertainers
I would like to welcome to the stage right now
Allure, Case, Common Sense and The Firm's very own AZ

(Case background)
Come on, come on, come on, come on)

(AZ)
A nigga seen it, triple beam shit, brown and green mix
Fiend this, made for machines that kick
Blow ya speakers out, only the real I speak about
Made to freak you out, fuck with ya mom but teach you routes
Nigga spots rollin, shoot-out, gun shots blowin
Older niggas got shorties on the block holdin
Lost, my youngest cousin sittin up north
Takin a short from another nigga hittin 'em off
Two to four, guess it's no tellin what some'll do to score
Four pounds give off sounds through the door
We waited, but now it's time to designate it
You hate it, had the drop but hesitated

(Hook - Allure & Case)
Life goes on, life like two's and five
Who decides what's wrong or right
Just got paid feelin good tonight
Life goes on
In my world, life like two's and five
Who decides what's wrong or right
Just got paid feelin good tonight
Life goes on and on

(Common)
Yo A-Zilla, you know I ain't the type to play killa
But this day still arrives in my mind like a light
A damn Thursday night, and plans to be out
'Til the night served daylight, but it ain't happen
Rappin to myself cause it wasn't no one to rap to
This villian came to me like 'somebody lookin at you'
Cause I'm Common Sense and I rap consciousness
He was prompt to diss, mad cause my guy used to knock his bitch
I could sense he was tryna' bring it, but I wasn't ready to recieve it
Fact I make him leave it
Before he popped some shit I did the opposite and stole 'em
Back his lady tried to hold him, like Big Pun I scold 'em and told 'em
I ain't a shooter I just punch a lot
Between blows this big tried to up his Glock
His brother watched swoop like big daddy on teenage love
He got ??? to my tape by C nigga Dub
Got his dome in a hug, muffed his broad back with one hand
Tried to pop, it must've been a Nas cause the gun jammed
Unplanned I disarmed this trick, nigga
Pistol-whipped his ass, his ladies, I was palmin it
Hollered '87 reign dominate'
Needed a fight that night, me and my woman had an argument

(Hook - Allure & Case)

(Case)
People come and people go, there's one thing that you must know
Life goes on yeah
No matter what you're going through, I'm just trying to tell you
Life goes on and on
Everybody's got their own thing, some just don't know how to handle it
I need to tell ya, you need to know
Cause I know, life goes on, life goes on

(Hook - Allure & Case)

Feelin good, feelin good
In my world, in my world
Feelin good
Where you gonna go

Cause it's about to go down
Straight like that
Oooh

Kid Capri
Ill Na Na
And the muthafuckin' L-O-X
That's right

Chorus (Styles)

]From the top of New York, where they be poppin' they corks
]From the bottom of the slums, where they be poppin' they guns
Niggas that rock whips and get plenty of one's
But niggas goin' hand and hand, are havin' to run
The niggas that had cake and got sent up state
For the mother who lost a child and had to set up a wake
For those who swan about the ghetto, but don't know how to skate
Guess you gotta live the life just keep the faith

[Sheek]
Aye yo, aye yo
Our shit contagious, so ya'll niggas try to quaratine us
Ya'll niggas shook up, and all that like Orangina's
My gun American, but my niggas got foreign nina's
Six cars between us, laced out
Half my money from the drug route, ya know how that goes
We hung in heavy metal clubs, and slung shit for the nose
It's Sheek Luchion, either at the bar with a groupie on
My python, gettin' sex
In hotels with connected the rooms
Fill letter walk through on his ex
Jadakiss and Styles smoke a pound up through a storm
Room service, bring 'em champagne with five matts on
From most hated, to heavy rotated, forget it
Next stop is movies, ya'll check it when Blockbuster get it
Cheap-skates, sweatin' off Capri's pre-release dates
For Money, Power & Respect, went platnuim out the gates
From Rusell Simmons to Puff, Lox and DMX got this
Big time, we probably shoot this joint up on tropics
When we eat fish like whiteies
And bitches have on nighties
Suckin' dick, me I'm on some jail shit
Standing up, jerkin' off, while these hoes eat each others clits
(Yuh heard me)

Chorus (Styles)

But niggas goin' hand and hand, are havin' to run
The niggas that had cake and got sent up state
For the mother who lost a child and had to set up a wake
For those who swan about the ghetto, but don't know how to skate
Guess you gotta live the life just keep the faith

[Foxy Brown]
Uhh, uhh
Bet I salute all chicks that be gettin' them chips
Throw it up, for my bitches, that be poppin' that Crist'
Specially to the one's, who be ridin' that dick
And if the pussy bangin', hope it cop to a stick
And all my thorough chicks, who cried and lied for these cats
Out of town, on a hound for these cats
If shit got thick, let off rounds for these cats
In the crocodle Prada, stash the pound for these cats
Me and my bitches got down for these cats
Paid our dues, for 62's, taped to the thigh
Seen the truth through the lie, but the bullshit aside
Like a trooper, I put that on my life that I ride
Conspiracy charge, straight copped out to 3-5
What fuck am I to do, suffer and die
Maximum 25, baby fuck if I fry
It's a ditry game, when it come to slingin' them thangs
Bail like a hundered-thou, but the us is more change
Shit, I used to trick that from jewels and the rings, huh

Chorus (Styles)

]From the top of New York, where they be poppin' they corks

For those who swan about the ghetto, but don't know how to skate
Guess you gotta live the life just keep the faith

[Styles]
Prayer one, for niggas that be bustin' they gun
Till the death, what'd you expect for a couple of one's
Prayer two, for niggas that ain't ever had shit
Masked up, blacked down, go on and grab shit
Prayer three, for niggas on lock without a key
That ain't never comin' home, but you know how it be
Livin' to die, but niggas ain't willin' to die
If you bust up in the air, you ain't killin' the sky
Feelin' the high, nigga is you willin' to lie
You a crumb and you dumb, you ain't stealin' the pie
I leave a bloody mess, nigga bigger then me, cut his neck
Lox brothers, ya'll niggas is cock-suckers
Yellow belly cowards, I want Money and the Power
Assassin, you think it's a joke, you'll die laughing
Hoppin' out the plane, and only bringing the captain
Start of a legacy, her heart broke down and start beggin' me
Dog I'm a whole different pedigree
Take me to the limit, I'm layin' in the cut
While you playin' in the scrimage
Meet you at the final
Lyrically, I'm spiritually, drunker then a whino
Posion, house full of rhyme
Bring your boys in
Tell 'em take it easy, have a seat on the couch
I'm the govenor, ya'll bitch niggas is crouts
Take orders, yuh need passports at the border
We transporting water, shit was flawed
Fell sick took a hit, but we wasn't the cure
Make your ear-drums pop, bottom lip drop
Eyes switch up, knees hit the floor by the time he spits up
Nobody gets up

Muthafuckas
L-O-X muthafucka
L-O-X, try this shit

Ras Kass the waterproof MC, Punchline

(Ras Kass)
These faggot MCs be on skis with the microphone though
But it's all downhill hitting trees like Sonny Bono
Name a nigga I couldn't burn and he probably created the Earth in six days
I shot at Jesus with a tech fives times
Hanging the pope with six strings, the name is Ras Kass
Might eat a little pussy but I don't kiss ass homeboy
I'm righteous and wicked and this acquisition of riches is like
Selling bean pods and still fucking white bicthes

(Punchline)
I rap crazy, you better get fifty niggas to blaze me
Or ace me, been rhyming since 220 AD
You feel gazy?, I'm top ten with the raps
Off the list you scratch, like serial numbers on gats
I lace tracks with ill lines 20 bar rhymes
My verses got long sentences like jail times
Press rewind, listen to jams when I cool out
I only fuck a bitch in the park if she juiced out
Going new routes to maintain my composure
Anticipated while you still screaming to get exposure
Rap soldier in the cipher I'm first to set it
My lyrics get the U.S. Open without playing tennis

(Ras Kass)
Vindictive my voice pitch is beyond John Blaze
I'm John Cremation, you conversation with aspirations
Of me leaving blood stains from Earth to Venus
Them so-called rap stars will still be living
With they moma like an unborn fetus
As soon as you step on stage I'mma destroy you with the truth
Like the Ricki Lake show, don't come out the soundproof booth
Or poof, plucked in your bubblegoose
A lost angel, I strangle at an angle that's obtuse

(Punchline)
Yo, my styles viscous, put niggas before bitches
Collect riches, bone chickens without trickin
And stay spitting mad rhymes in your direction
Always repping get you open like seasections
I rhyme greata set it off without Jada
My flava leave a nigga shook like vibrators
Rap composer of the hit your styles over
I make an MC cry just like Robin on Ophra
Give you the cold shoulder guess who rhymes slicker
I gross figures, shed light on shady niggas
And write rhymes, roast niggas that take mine
Gave birth to so many styles I should have my tubes tied
One time, when rappers need concentration
Embarrass I nigga, like getting caught masterbating
I'm fascinating, I make you wallow in your sorrow
Clutch the bottle you get your childish style fondled
My rap tactics make you want to go home and practice
Match this, drop jewels like Biago Rackis
I come rough for all niggas that front
I'm all that five mics and quotable for the month

(Ras Kass)
I be on some bullshit like the unamits and vigorous rhyming
And until Buchwhick Bill starts dunking on Kobe Bryant
I'm applying pressure, check out my melody
The eighteenth letter, the first letter
The nineteenth letter for cheddar
And get a barrette explosive tip shredders to make the rum-redder
To make the deader then Coretta
Scott King's husband who had a dream
I get in you with no Vaseline
And burn rubber so I tap that ass like Savion Glover

(Punchline)
That the sedative cause your shits repetitive
And played out, tried to run game but it got rained out
Wasn't thinking about this style until we came out
Took a detour when some of ya'll went the same route
Thoughts about doing Punchline make me tickle
When my flow changes like pennies, dimes and nickels
Organized rhymes we make the girls realize
We humiliate niggas like a small dick size
Now you wanna click nines, front and sip wines
Take mine, can't mess with Ras and Punchline[Verse 1: Big L]
Aiyyo, you betta flee hops, or get your head flown three blocks
L keep rappers' hearts pumping like Reeboks
And every year I gain clout and my name sprouts
Some brothers'd still be virgins if the crack never came out
I got the wild style, always been a foul child
My guns go BOOM BOOM, and yo' guns go pow-pow
I'm known to have a hottie open, I keep the shottie smoking
Front and get half the bones in your body broken
And when it comes to getting nookie I'm not a rookie
I got girls that make that chick Toni Braxton look like Whoopi
I run with sturdy cliques I'm never hittin' dirty chicks
Got thirty-five bodies, buddy don't make it thirty-six
Step to this you're good as gone, word is bond
I leave mics torn when I put it on

[Hook: Kid Capri]
So put it on Big L, put it on
C'mon put it onnn, and onnn, and onnn
C'mon put it on Big L, put it on
C'mon put it on represent put it on, C'MON!

[Verse 2: Big L]
Nobody can take nothing from Big L but a loss chief
The last punk who fronted got a mouth full of false teeth
I'm known to gas a hottie and blast the shottie
Got more cash than Gotti, you don't know, you better ask somebody
Big L is a crazy brother, and I'm a lady lover
A smooth kid that'll run up in your baby mother
I push a slick Benz, I'm known to hit skins
And get ends and commit sins with sick friends
Cause I'm a money getter, also a honey hitter
You think you nice as me? Ha ha, you'se a funny nigga
I flows so one of my shows, wouldn't be clever to miss
I'm leaving competitors pissed
To tell you the truth, it gets no better than this
I'm catching wreck to the break of dawn
In this song, yo it's a must that I put it on

[Hook: Kid Capri]

[Bridge: Patois Chatta]
Some boys see me gun nozzle and take a we fi joke
Boy you gwan dead before you see me gun smoke
See me gun nozzle and take me fi joke
You gwan dead, from a me you provoke

[Verse 3: Big L]
I drink Moet not Beck's beer, I stay dressed in slick gear
Peace to my homies in the gangster lean I see you when I get there
And it's a fact I keep a gat in my arm reach
I charm freaks and bomb geeks from here to Palm Beach
I'm putting rappers in the wheelchair
Big L is the villain you still fear
Cause I be hanging in Harlem and shit is for real here
If you battle L you picked the wrong head
I smash mics like cornbread, you can't kill me I was born dead
And I'm known to pull steel trigs and kill pigs
I run with ill kids and real nigs who peel wigs
My rap's steady slamming, I keep a heavy cannon
It's a new sheriff in town, and it ain't Reggie Hammond
Peace to my peoples, the Children of the Corn
Cause we put it on, adi√≥s, ghost I'm gone[Kid] Yeahhhhh!
[Nas] Uhh, QB
[Kid] All the people in the place!
It's the one and only Kid Capri
[Nas] Uhh, TM nigga
[Kid] Along with my man Nas Escobar
[Nas] Ill Will
[Kid] We about to take this one all around the world
So y'all feel this one, come on!

Verse One: Nas

My antidote to the dope add drugs in the party
Pistol-whippin your body lyrical oddessey
Y'all ain't smoke real shit less y'all smokin with me
And y'all ain't heard real shit, til you heard it from me
Escobar, I toasted with Frank White, to this new era
Of gangster life, slangin words in the mic
Thanks to the life, I urge y'all to write pain
You a whore to the war, I remain a virgin that's tight
This game I'mma run til it's done, stack my funds
Packin guns, clean each gat, once a month
Hope ya toast carry heavy as the vest on your chest
Hope you squeeze it cause you're only safe from stomach to chest
Everything else, left open, I'm smokin
Next to your balls, police won't even question at all
It's the Esc- to the -bar, connects in ?Piar?
Overlord of rap, U.S. France to Ecuodar

Chorus: Nas

Have you ever met a QB gangsta, who would
Shake your hand and turn ya back he would shank ya?
Niggas want the street you lookin for me
You want the hot shit you must cop the Kid Capri
Ladies dance to it, niggas pound that in your Jeep
Esco' and Kid Capri, with the motherfuckin Soundtrack
To the Street, thugs pop to it, sell rocks to it
Puffin L's poppin Glocks to it

Verse Two: Nas

Me and the streets share the same vein, same pain
The whole game changed, niggas with no brain could make dough
Off of cocaine, Colombian neckties
Democrats to Bill Clinton gotta respect Nas
Customized flow, words stitched into the seams
Tailor made lyrics words fit ya, spit scripture worship
Far from Ali, niggas can't spar with the kid
Regardless of your bid or who you partners with
Spit, cartridges at so-called hard ni-ggaz
You get, sparked and hit, held as hostages
You know how the mobsters is from the heart of the Bridge
We just started gettin dough, yo pardon the kid
I ain't used to havin shit, my youth as bad as it get
Ghetto bound first lesson was to let off rounds
Shots, echo the town, New York, home of
The Harlem mix tape, master as we all know him now

Chorus

Verse Three: Nas

Uhh, what? Kid Capri
Soundtrack to the Street a theme for every hood
Every lockdown facility, get ?oxed? down for grillin me
Write down hostility, iced down with friends of ours
Respect money and power and them honies that swallow
But what's becomin Apollo, nuttin but bigga bank
Fuck you niggas think I ride for?
Same thing niggas die for, so we draw guns
The same time in this war, leave your mind on the floor
Niggas doin thirty to life to survive in this world
Transportin keys that's inside of a door
Openin spots from Little Rock to Baltimore
Smoked out, chillin on the Kid Capri world tour

Chorus

[Kid Capri]
Yeah
Word up, come on
We make it bump one time word up
My man Nas make it bump one time come on
Come on, we make it bump one time word up
The Kid Capri make it bump one time come on

Chorus

[Kid Capri]
And I say party people, it's the Kid Capri
Nas Escobar, Soundtrack to the Streets
Jumpin off, youknowhatI'msayin?
You a part of history, stay tuned, uh![KRS-One]
Bo! Boom bye bye, hip-hop will never die
Despite the fact that I'm fly I'm never dry
You could beat me, cheat me, when you meet me try to defeat me
But nevertheless you'll have stress, cause I don't rest
You wanna know what my problem is, if you're curious??
I take this hip-hop shit too serious!!
I forget that other rappers ain't true to this
So when they grab the mic I get hyped like LET'S DO THIS!!
All my rhymes are fat, while rappers are skimpy, wimpy
So I simply chew they crew like a Blimpie
Skip me when you dissin, skip me when you on a ego mission..
I blow up, like nitroglycerin!
You better tune in to Teddy Ted
"Yo stop frontin', and use your head"

[KRS-One]
Well if you ain't called it hip-hop, there's a door, I ain't stoppin
I got more flavors than Baskin Robbins!
I flash the funky fresh flavors force-fully
Freak the phonies and flip philosophy constantly (true!)
That reminds me, rappers rock drip-drop
Not hip-hop, they wanna SING and all dem ting
Thank God KRS is still rappin; all that "ooh I love you baby"
And "blink blink blink" - this ain't happenin

[Kid Capri]
Yo this is curtains for these rappers that be frontin on the next man
Lookin down at brothers just because they gettin checks and
Haven't got a skill but they're LARGE on the hum-bum
You wanna step to Kid Capri, COME COME COME!!
I break em up, just for actin like a superstar
Around the way, we got a neighborhood trooper car
We ride by, and spray your crew, and your honies too
And rip you open and drink your blood like a Mountain Dew

[KRS-One]
I descend I lend a friend a helping hand
To stop a trend, again and again and again, I just can't say when
I beg to confess my sins to other men
Reverands guard lips, within there I'll begin
I'll always win, over-sakin
The party is ripped, without a hit or with a hit I'm rippin shit
You must admit, I'll never quit the lyrics I flip
I'm tough like licorice, battlin Kid Capri? It's ridiculous
We come to the party inconspicuous..[OC]
The whole city's under siege when we come through wit guns blazin
You need to take a seat son, you just started shavin
Respect ya elders, stay in a child's play
The monotone flow stayin even wit the bass
Oh good Lord, we throw it like a javelin toss
Arrogance is the feature that we added for floss
Come and get headline, destined to get riches
From either rappin our ass off or brick shipments
Cover all regions, makin sure the product gets spread out
We talk behind the mac you bust lead out
Wit next prospect, no particular concept do we follow
Smooth but yet solid like marble

[Diamond]
Niggas ain't fuckin wit D, fuckin wit me
Lookin at me like "Yo, what can it be?"
In the wide body-7 while you suckin the D
Spent out in the wedge while I'm fuckin for free
Scared to death like you stuck in a tree
I'mma stretch your ass out like I'm cuttin the deed
Frontin like a big man but you stuck in a three
So you know your floss game ain't nuttin to me
When the sun hits the cross, yo it's something to see
R-B, Kid Capri niggas runnin wit me
Twenty karats on the wrist ain't nuttin to me
Do you no good frontin to me, nigga

[Kid Capri]
Aiyyo Tone, let's Touch these niggas wit the wand
Then blow up like a bomb
Made moves faster than the Autobahn
The Kid Capri is a institution, and all ya'll niggas is pollution
Starin up a whole lot of confusion
It's simple, let's move out all these corn cats
And disc jock dissin MC's that got the borin raps
Fuck what ya got, grimy niggas don't wanna hear it
Niggas take it, soon as they near it, you better fear it
Bronx Bomber, the pretty-fly girl charmer
The black Italian, the cash keep pilin as I'm smilin
So hear me now, I bring the thunder plus the rumble
And I'll step back and watch your whole career just crumble

[AG]
Well it's the cheeba steamer, brains on trains, won't eat her neither
Benz to the plane, off the plane to the Beemer
Insane and off the meter, in the rain I'll heat up
And ya'll can't stop my sunshine, fuck one-time
Got heavy wit gats to push your face back
Trash-ass album sound like you played it on eight-track
Rip you from the roots and under
Triple gooses in the summer
Mean long guns is producin the thunder
Convertible Hummers, we shit on the Glock
Try to put the roof up, I'll tell Show to piss on the top
Wrist on the watch, roll wit a click or a Glock
Plan on gettin a lot, from spittin or not
Cool wit niggas that be flippin a lot
Probably got shit on your block
And if you hate, I'll take it back to '88 (Nigga, get off the top)
It's two-g's, let's get this money, you wit it or not
But I'll switch topics like my bitch wit thongs in the tropics
Make hits, straight hits
Perform as long as I got it
Seven-digits wit my name on the dotted
Remain Dirty and potted, ya'll know me for the ruckus
G.D. I only can fuck wit
Get the dutch and tell Tony to Touch it

[Party Artie]
Guns, I tote them things
Blunts, I smoke them things
Rhymes, I wrote them things
It's no such thing, as hoes fron-ting
We run train, I do my thug thing
Grab the mic and leave a mud stain
So get Tide wit bleach when I rhyme wit beats
Niggas do crimes to eat
No pork, I don't talk, the nines just speak
I'm the kind to creep on your block wit the heat cocked
Got the street locked, smackin niggas out they Reeboks
It's Party Artie, I get dirty wit the Ewoks
The infrared hit you in the head from three blocks
Away, Been There Done That like Dr. Dre
It Ain't My Fault like Silkk the Shocker say
Ya'll niggas gots to pay, shots'll spray
From the Bronx to Far Rockaway
My whole team, strapped like Bokeem
Fuck bein in jail, trapped wit no cream

[Lord Finesse]
I be the don that's known to have the style sewn
More cheese than calzones, give chicks the dialtone
Build like brownstones when we slaughter your plan
Touch albums, so hot comes wit a portable fan
Type to starve the mic when I hog the light
Lay my life on the line if the odds is right
Gettin the, spot and gleam while you plot and scheme
To stop the team, three words nigga: watch and dream
You just mad hater, cuz we movin wit dough
You don't make sense like wearin suede shoes in the snow
Finesse frontin? Y'all know me, I don't stress nuttin
Bought your album, that's how I broke the eject button
Don't stress dudes, we just plot our next move
Make niggas look stupid like joggin pants wit dress shoes
The prophet, shit john blaze like the tropics
Type of nigga need a ? just for my pockets
Don't flex punks, we sex stunts, collect lumps
You flossin now, you be pardon by next month
Type of thug, yo I was born to bug
Waitin for us to fall, nigga join the club, what* originally appeared on Slick Rick's "Soundtrack to the Streets"

[Snoop Dogg]
I falls off into a party in the N.Y.C
Niggas lookin at me strange but they lovin my chain
Bang bang, same thang, game came when I left em
I do it by my lonely now I'm the Big Homie

[Slick Rick]
But I'm his Royal Slickness, ghetto weakness, cause  Rick is
The one who expose cornball rappers with the quickness
(Uhh) Who bum from and who balls you hung from
Wouldn't give a fuck what part of the country you come from

[Snoop Dogg]
I'm Snoop Dogg, I'm smooth and imperial
I wake up every morning to my Lucky Charms cereal
Times get drastic, yeah I'm a classic
Dogg Pound Gangsta chokin off that Boombastic

[Slick Rick]
Now put my verse on the first one-beat the herds come
So be careful cause my rap will make you eat your words son
(Word to God) Scratch I? Who the hardest to match (I)
Bright rewrite your still Garbage to Patch

[Snoop Dogg]
Haven't you heard? I'm loose, shook the Feds like The Juice
Snoop Dogg is a hundred-and-twenty-first proof
Fool usea deuce-deuce of some Genuine, Draft
I'm genuine, like Vinny's whinin all about cash
Cash, cash, so indeed I got the weed
And keep the lighter for the hash, has it
Ever been a time when you didn't have a dime
And the only way to get it was to go and do a crime?

Chorus: Slick Rick (repeat 2X)

Many underclothes hangin on the hoes
Since (Snoop, Slick Rick) crushed anyone opposed
Lot of ladies - pop Cristal, toast to all those
Like (Kid Capri) helpin to Unify both coasts

[Slick Rick]
I'm shredding your temple, none, 'head of the emperor
Washed up, gang member? Better remember
I wipe my feet upon a rapper like a doormat
I hit em -- where they sit around actin hardcore at
Thank God for the guardians - in light of this
Rappers always beg for me to show them who The Mighty is
Gats gonna limp, snaps on a kid
That always wanna start rappin (boy they're not gonna win)
And wanna dash at lethal or evil
Could a King bring style and class to black people?
Stick a whole log in and he buggin
Cause I - represent self, with my man Snoop Dogg and them
I drop a pile of semen on em
Even in a Yugo I could take they woman from em
I make the hardest chew the kewl of this
Kid Capri, know the part of peasant, who The Ruler is?

Chorus

[Snoop Dogg]
I'm twenty-six.. still in the mix
My hair gettin longer, my game gettin stronger
A nigga been on one, I thank God
Cause life in the city of stars is gettin hard
And it's odd, for a G to get a job
So I'd rather steal and rob, and mob with my squad
My homie used to bang, now we follow Farrakhan
Used to read The Source
Now all he read is the Holy Qu'ran
Time brings change and change brings time
Listen to me hit you with this gangbang rhyme
Nigga, whattup, who up, YOU up!
Doggy Dogg is on the mic
I'm here to fuck it izzzup
I give it to y'all, like you really got to have it
Dogg Pound Gangstaz, boy this shit is gettin tragic
But I'mma make me a grip and dip quick
And fuck with my nigga Kid Capri on this G shit
Dial tail and bail with my nigga Slick Rick-y
And all you niggas talkin bullshit can just miss me
Can't twist me, you fuckin paper haters
I'm dippin in my nine-eight gold Navigator
I'm dippin like a lo-lo
Bouncin, smokin ounces, fo' sho' doe

Chorus 1.5X[Intro: Kid Capri]
Oh yeah.. as we celebrate hip-hop, baby
Oh yeah.. as we celebrate hip-hop, baby, whoa
Yeah, it's Ghostface and the man Kid Capri
Let's celebrate New York, around the world, and
Yo, Ghostface, go in heavy, man, let's do it

[Hook 1: Ghostface Killah] + (Rare Earth "I Just Want to Celebrate" sample)
(I just want to celebrate) Like my squad won the Super Bowl
(I just want to celebrate) Like we bangin on New Years Eve yall
(I just want to celebrate) Like we just beat trial
(I just want to celebrate) We hype for just bein here

[Ghostface Killah]
Stones on every arm, the crib is ten million
The corks from Dom Perignon can't reach my ceiling
Four maids with four grenades
When the sun's in my face, all I do is lower the walls for shade
The pool's a pain in the ass, fifty grand on Windex kid
They keep it clean the whole bottom is glass
So you can see the sharks and piranhas, a pair of pajamas
That's my neighbor, the faggot disresepecting my mama
No cars in the garage, it's underground shit
They way the floor open up you think I'm hiding spaceships
French chefs, the best grapes on they breath
Louie aprons on the Yank cats, the puffy cooks the rest
Besides I got birds that never leave the nest
They fuck with me, I'll watch em confess, then I'll go rest
Get back up deposit them checks
Muthafuckas fuckin up a good time by snappin your necks, come on

[Hook 2: Ghostface Killah (Rare Earth sample)]
(I just want to celebrate) Like my baby's first steps you heard
(I just want to celebrate) Like my first time platinum yall
(I just want to celebrate) Like my first piece of nookie, Uhh
(I just want to celebrate) We hype for just bein here

[Ghostface Killah] + (Cocoa Channelle)
Money for everybody, candy to the kids
Catch me on dateline, Starky too big
I'm like a mannequin, I stay jig
Mansion parties for all star weekend in my L.A. crib
We can to party, run out of Goose we got Dollies
Shorties sweattin me, check out her body, uhh
Throw up your hands like it's your birthday, mommy
Let's celebrate, now I got her girlfriends behind me
Now I'm in the middle, watch is all chiseled
I can holla at the birds like Dr. Dolittle
(What's that in your pocket Ghost?) a Dill pickle
(Not that) oh that's the forty-five stainless nickel
I'm pullin a green, gotta G for the biggest ass
On the floor who look right in them jeans
If you fat, I might take one for the team
But I gotta get drunk first knowhatimean, come on

[Hook 3: Ghostface Killah] + (Rare Earth sample)
(I just want to celebrate) Like we won the Power Ball money
(I just want to celebrate) Tony Starks won an Oscar yall
(I just want to celebrate) Like all of my goons just came home
(I just want to celebrate) We bout to have a good year

[Ghostface Killah] + (Cocoa Channelle)
Na-na-na-na-nah, you can't catch me
I'm out like Thomas in, in a five-fifty
Police be fiendin to frisk me
I'm so legit I walk away with the car keys pissy
Back at the labo, shorty wop need a Dutch
He fuckin wit a Goose dick, tonight I'mma beat it up
Your thing to wet, you sure you ain't seeded up
(That's how I get Ghost, especially when you eat it up)
My goodness gracious, ass is flirtatious
Move it around like a snake miss or sexy waitress
Ghost don't have no patience
I like you, I usually change chicks like radio stations
I'm, definitely not lookin for love
But if you give it to me right now I might say I was
You can chill if you want I got crazy bud
But before we do what it do, go jump in the tub, come on

[Hook 4: Trife Da God] + (Rare Earth sample) {Ghostface Killah}
(I just want to celebrate) Throw ya hands up nigga
(I just want to celebrate) Pop the 'pagne, pop the cork
(I just want to celebrate) Representin' on the streets of New York
(I just want to celebrate) {We bout to have a good year}

[Outro: Kid Capri]
Yeah, we gets it in, gets it in, gets it in
New York, we been had it, we gets it in
Outta town we fuckin' up but gets it in
Worldwide we doin', we gets it in
The Ghostface, Kid Capri, I gets it in
That's no joke, when we here, we get it in
No kidding, in the building, getting it in
All day, getting it in...[Biz Markie]
Yo! Your moms so poor
She went in Kentucky Fried Chicken and licked everybody else's fingers

[Kid Capri]
Yo Biz man you know that ain't my style

[Biz Markie]
Tchk, yo man what IS your style Capri?

[Kid Capri]
You know my style..

Give me the mic, Lords of Funk is in full flight
I keep you goin and flowin, all day and night
So lets proceed with the sounds that you really need
The Kid is funky and my DJ got a lot of speed
Silver D and Money Mark, is blowin up
Don't think we won't be at a battle cause we're showin up
And if you ever try to diss you're gonna get stomped
I'm gonna make it plain and simple - there's no COMP!
Yeah I said it, so whatcha gonna do about it?
The Kid Capri is super dope, I just gotta shout it
The Lords of Funk will rock a party for a while
Now I can tell you that, but you know my style
You know my style..

Now my country 'tis of thee, let me tell you what it means to me
I really love it when them crowds scream for me
It gets me hyped, makes me wanna rock right
From tonight, all the way until tomorrow night
You know the flavor, so now, do me a favor
Please respond to the sounds Kid Capri gave ya
I worked hard, to do what I do for people
I'm not conceited, cause everybody is my equal
I had a problem, with suckers, that tried to diss
I overlooked 'em but they still wanted to persist
I had to blow up, and blow up on 'em very large
Cause chaos, and war, and sabotage
They made me mad, even though they didn't harm me
They stepped off when I went, and got my army
Money Mark, Silver D, and Troopa Love
Poppa Duke chillin with, the man above
You couldn't diss me, no matter, how much you paid
You made the record, but I'm the one that gets it played
Red Alert, he's blazin on my radio
And I'm the man, that's blazin in your auto
I go cameo, you think that youse a super ho?
You get sprayed, and played like a afro
So go ahead Hobbes, I make fingers pop
And you could never, get what the Kid Capri got
Before I blow up, my man you better show up
Cause once I'm finished with you, you're gonna throw up
I get respect, I teach 'em, and then correct
You're out of order out of style like a mock neck
I'm gettin papers, while you suck Now or Laters
I wear a silk Guess denim, and alligators
So go ahead chump, I'm not the one son
I grab the mic and wax that booty like a shotgun
I'm not frontin, or fakin, or 'fessin to ya
I'm Kid Capri, so let that be a lesson to ya!

Punk, you know my style
Don't ever try to front kid, cause you know my style
On the down low, you know my style

Oh man there go my main man Spud Luva for the Troopa Love crew

[Grand Puba]
First things first, here goes the opposite of worst
Slid out my mother's ass, looked at the nurse, and kicked a verse
This ain't my man Heav's joint, so shit, here's a curse
For those who got stuck, well KCUF means FUCK!
That's what I like to do after the Puba makes a buck
For those who say I suck well then step up and push your luck
You're aced out, now your assed-out, I still hit joints
Til they pass out, at three o'clock I let my MC class out (UH!)
So keep a clear focus, cause I say hocus pocus
That's all I have to say to make the mob swarm like locusts (YEAH!)
Then I climb the bridge, push Uptown to the ?
To the Harlem River Drive to pick up Ali at the Rutgers
Then we chatta-nagga-noogi, to go pick up Stud Doogie.. "easy back it up"
Ha hah, so all you Grand Puba wannabees
You better pack it up	"easy back it up"

	"Back it up, huh, easy back it up"
	"huh, easy back it up"
	BACK IT UP!
	"Back it up, huh, easy back it up"
	"huh, easy back it up"

[Kid Capri]
Now dig it
Here's the kid, never did a bid
Never hit skid, check out the shit I did
Live in the Bronx, born in Brooklyn
Chilled in Manhattan never got my shit tooken
I'm easy on the flex, you know my shit is right
We're goin on a flight, so hold on tight
Kid Capri is on point with my man Grand Puba
If suckers try to flex they'll get twisted like a tuba
Never cause trouble, that's not my style
Always on the move, stack papes by the pile
I'm crazy on the low, but I go places though
I always do a show so you know I got dough
Girls try to sweet talk, but bullshit walk
For those who try to hawk I stab clit like a fork
I'm very intelligent, so don't try to play me
Try to press the issue and I'll bust that ass baby
I'm thick like a shake, very high yella
Describe Kid Capri, Uptown's big fella
So now you know the flavor, and please do me a favor
Stay your ass out my path, cause I snap you like a gator, later

Sneaks out his door, a to the elevator
Gets on the sixth, and gets off on the fifth

His little pocket knife in his hand

A few people try to mug him, crack dealers love him
Delivery boys think highly of him

A diamond to sell, three point one carat
"So what he did?"  Sold it to the first floor faggot
No real money, one and a third
But the brother's gonna get, as high as a bird
Bell bottoms, yes the man invented the slacks
Old fashioned turn them naked pointy shoes with spats
He got the limp to his walk, hat cocked just right
Walkin down the block, lookin like, Willy Dynamite!

He can tell you what he can do, and what he can not
He get you radios or TV's, clocks and beds
He's gettin, twenty to life once he's caught by the feds
His name was Billy
