[Intro: Jimmy Smith]
Good God Almighty. Like back in the old days. You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock but we just went in the studio and we did it. We had the champagne in the studio, of course, compliments of the company, and we just laid back and did it. So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you. Because we had a ball. Only real music is gonna last, all the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow...

[Hook: Timbaland]
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all

[Verse 1: Drake]
After hours of Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' women and vino
The contract like '91 Dan Marino
I swear this guy Michael Rapino's boosting my ego
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growin' 'bout who they think is the best now?
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talking, say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents, but thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn
With the ink I could murder, word to my nigga Irv
Yeah, I swear shit just started clickin' dog
You know it's real when you are who you think you are

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
I had Benzes 'fore you had braces
The all-black Maybach but I'm not a racist
Inside's whiter than Katy Perry's face is
Yellow diamonds in my Jesús
I just might learn to speak Mandarin
Japanese for the yen that I'm handlin'
International Hov, that's my handle
My saint's Changó, light a candle
El Gran Santo on the mantle
Case y'all didn't know, I speak Spanish too
Shout out to World Wide Wes
Everywhere we go, we leave a worldwide mess
Yes, still Roc La Familia
Says a lot about you if you not feelin' us
The homies said "Hov, it ain't many of us"
I told 'em less is more niggas, plenty of us

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jay Z]
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, cake
500 million, I got a pound cake
Niggas is frontin', that's upside-down cake
Get 'em a red nose, they clown cakes
They shoulda never let you 'round cake
Look at my neck, I got a carrot cake
Now here's the icin' on the cake
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, uhh
I'm just gettin' started, oh, yeah, we got it bitch
I've done made more millionaires than the lotto did
Dame made millions, Biggs made millions
Ye made millions, Just made millions
Lyor made millions, Cam made millions
Beans'a tell you if he wasn't in his feelins
I'm back in my bag
My eyes bloodshot but my jet don't lag
A pair of Jordan 3's tryna chase this cash
Gucci air bag just in case we crash
Uh, last night was mad trill
I'm fresh out of Advil, Jesus grab the wheel

[Part 2: Paris Morton Music 2, Produced by Detail]

[Verse 1: Drake]
Look, fuck all that "Happy to be here" shit that y'all want me on
I'm the big homie, they still be tryna lil bro me, dog
Like I should fall in line, like I should alert niggas
When I'm 'bout to drop somethin' crazy and not say I'm the greatest
Of my generation, like I should be dressing different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit
And do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doin' it the same
Man, I'm doing it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here
So I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts that I would share with myself
But I thought "Fuck it"
It's worth it to share 'em with someone else other than Paris for once
I text her from time to time, she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to
I got a compound but I think she's straight
Cause she supported since Hot Beats right before Wayne came
And got me out of the back room where I was rapping with Jas over beats that I shouldn't have in the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway
Three months later, I'm his artist
He probably wouldn't remember that story
But that shit stick with me
Always couldn't believe when he called me
You never know, it could happen to you
And I just spent four Ferraris all on a brand new Bugatti
And did that shit cause it's somethin' to do
Yeah, I guess that's just who I became, dog
Nothing was the same, dog[Produced by RZA]

[Intro: Raekwon, Method Man]
What that nigga want God
Word up, look out for the cops Wu-Tang five finger shit
Cash rules
Word up, two for fives over here baby
Word up, two for fives them niggas got garbage down the way, word up
Kno' what I'm saying
Cash rules everything around me C.R.E.A.M. get
Yeah, check this old fly shit out, word up
Cash rules everything around me
Take you on a natural joint
C.R.E.A.M. get the money
Here we here we go
Dolla dolla bill y'all
Check this shit

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side
Staying alive was no jive
Had secondhands, Mom's bounced on old man
So then we moved to Shaolin land
A young youth, yo, rocking the gold tooth, 'Lo goose
Only way I be gettin' the G off was drug loot
And let's start it like this son, rolling with this one and that one
Pulling out Gats for fun
But it was just a dream for the teen who was a fiend
Started smoking woolas at 16
And running up in gates, and doing hits for high stakes
Making my way on fire escapes
No question I would speed for cracks and weed
The combination made my eyes bleed
No question I would flow off and try to get the dough all
Sticking up white boys in ball courts
My life got no better, same damn 'Lo sweater
Times is rough and tough like leather
Figured out I went the wrong route
So I got with a sick-ass clique and went all out
Catching keys from across seas
Rolling in MPV's every week we made forty G's
Yo nigga respect mine or here go the TEC-9
Ch-chick-POW, move from the gate now

[Hook: Method Man]
Cash rules everything around me:
CREAM, get the money
Dollar, dollar bill y'all

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
It's been twenty-two long hard years of still struggling
Survival got me bugging, but I'm alive on arrival
I peep at the shape of the streets
And stay awake to the ways of the world cause shit is deep
A man with a dream with plans to make cream
Which failed; I went to jail at the age of fifteen
A young buck selling drugs and such who never had much
Trying to get a clutch at what I could not touch
The court played me short, now I face incarceration
Pacin' - going upstate's my destination
Handcuffed in the back of a bus, forty of us
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
But as the world turns I learned life is hell
Living in the world no different from a cell
Every day I escape from Jakes giving chase, selling base
Smoking bones in the staircase
Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess
I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed
But I'm still depressed and I ask what's it worth?
Ready to give up so I seek the old Earth
Who explained working hard may help you maintain
To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
We got stickup kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks and
Stray shots, all on the block that stays hot
Leave it up to me while I be living proof
To kick the truth to the young Black youth
But shorty's running wild, smoking sess, drinking beer
And ain't trying to hear what I'm kicking in his ear
Neglected for now, but yo, it gots to be accepted
That what? That life is hectic

[Hook: Method Man]

[Outro: Raekwon]
Niggas got to do what they got to do
To get through - know what I'm saying?
Because you can't just get by no more - word up -
You gotta get over - straight up and down

[Hook: Method Man][Produced by RZA, No I.D., Kanye West, Mike Dean, and Jeff Bhasker]

[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
You might think you’ve peeped the scene
You haven’t, the real one’s far too mean
The watered down one, the one you know
Was made up centuries ago
They made it sound all wack and corny
Yes, it’s awful, blasted boring
Twisted fictions, sick addictions
Well, gather ‘round children, zip it, listen:

[Hook: Teyana Taylor]
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
I fantasized 'bout this back in Chicago
Mercy, mercy me, that Murcielago
That's me, the first year that I blow
How you say broke in Spanish? Me no hablo
Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
Me found bravery in my bravado
DJs need to listen to the models
"You ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy in your Serato?"
(You ain't got no Yeezy, nigga?)
Stupid, but what the hell do I know?
I'm just a Chi-town nigga with a Nas flow
And my chick in that new Phoebe Philo
So much head, I woke up in Sleepy Hollow

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
Sex is on fire, I'm the King of Leon-a Lewis
Beyond the truest, hey, teacher, teacher
Tell me how do you respond to students?
And refresh the page and restart the memory?
Respark the soul and rebuild the energy?
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemies
Sorry for the night demons still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air, rollin' down the window
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
Don't make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines, huh
And then they make noise

[Hook]

[Bridge: Bon Iver & Kanye West]
At the mall, there was a seance
Just kids, no parents
Then the sky filled with herons
(I saw the devil) in a Chrysler LeBaron
And the hell, it wouldn't spare us
And the fires did declare us
But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress
And woke up back in Paris

[Hook][Produced by Kanye West, Mike Dean & No I.D.]

[Bridge: Swizz Beatz]
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Two hands in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, this shit ridiculous
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I'm so appalled, Spalding ball
Balding, Donald Trump taking dollars from y'all
Baby, you're fired, your girlfriend hired
But if you don't mind, I'mma keep you on call
We above the law, we don't give a fuck about y'all
I got dogs that'll chew a fucking hole through the wall
But since they all lovers, I need more rubbers
And if I don't use rubbers, need more covers
Housekeeping, I mean goddamn
One time let it be a bad bitch sweeping
That know we get O's like Cheerios
That know because they seen us in the videos
That know the day that you play me
Would be the same day MTV play videos
That was a little joke, voila
Praises due to the most high, Allah
Praises due to the most fly, Prada
Baby, I'm magic, tada
Address me as your highness, high as United
Thirty-thousand feet up and you are not invited
Niggas be writing bullshit like they gotta work
Niggas is going through real shit, man, they out of work
That's why another goddamn dance track gotta hurt
That's why I'd rather spit something that got a purp'

[Hook]
Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches
I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous
Five star dishes, different exotic fishes
Man this shit is fucking ridiculous

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
How should I begin this? I'm just so offended
How am I even mentioned by all these fucking beginners?
I'm so appalled, I might buy the mall
Just to show niggas how much more I have in store
I'm fresher than you all, so I don't have to pause
All of y'all can suck my balls through my drawers
Dark Knight feeling, die and be a hero
Or live long enough to see yourself become a villain
I went from the favorite to the most hated
But would you rather be underpaid or overrated?
Moral victories is for minor league coaches
And 'Ye already told you we major, you cockroaches
Show me where the boats is, Ferrari Testarossas
And Hammer went broke so you know I'm more focused
I lost 30 mil, so I spent another 30
Cause unlike Hammer, thirty million can't hurt me
Fucking insane, the fuck am I saying?
Not only am I fly, I'm fucking not playing
All these little bitches too big for they britches
Burning they little bridges, fucking ridiculous

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Success is what you make it, take it how it come
A half a mil in twenties like a billion where I'm from
An arrogant drug dealer, the legend I become
CNN said I'd be dead by 21
Blackjack, I just pulled an ace
As you looking at the king in his face
Everything I dream, motherfuckers, I'm watching it take shape
While to you I'm just a young rich nigga that lacks faith
Range Rove, leather roof, love war, fuck a truce
Still move a bird like I'm in bed with Mother Goose
Them hoes coming in a baker's dozen
Claiming they was with me when they know they really wasn't
I keep the city's best, never said she was the brightest
So if you had her too, it don't affect me in the slightest
I never met a bitch that didn't need a little guidance
So I dismiss her past until she disappoints your highness
I speak the gospel, hostile
Tony doing time for what he did to nostrils
Paranoid mind, I'm still under the watchful
Eye of the law, aspire for more
Them kilos came, we gave you Bobby Brown jaw
Flaws ain't flaws when it's you that makes the call
Flow similar to the legends of the falls
Spill it, I own you all, yeah

[Bridge]

[Verse 4: Cyhi The Prynce]
Hah, I am so outrageous
I wear my pride on my sleeve like a bracelet
If God had an iPod, I'd be on his playlist
My phrases amazes the faces in places
The favorite, hah, my cup overrunneth with hundreds
Dummy, damn, it's hard not for me to waste it
The new Commandment: "Thou shalt not hate, kid"
My movement is like the civil rights, I'm Ralph David
Abernathy, so call my lady Rosa Parks
I am nothing like them niggas, baby, those are marks
I met this girl on Valentine's Day, fucked her in May
She found out about April, so she chose to march
Hah, damn another broken heart
I keep bitches by the twos, nigga, Noah's ark
I got a seven on me, I call my 'dro Lamar
Plus a Trojan in my pocket, Matt Leinart
G-A-T in the Pathfinder
Cause you haters got PhDs
Y'all just some major haters and some math minors
Tiger Woods, don't make me grab iron

[Hook: RZA]
Ayo, champagne wishes and thirty white bitches
You know the shit is fucking ridiculous
Cars for the missus and furs for the mistress
You know that shit is fucking ridiculous

[Bridge][Intro - Wu-Tang movie dialogue]
A game of chess is like a swordfight;
You must think first before you move
Toad style is immensely strong and immune to nearly any weapon;
When it's properly used it's almost invincible

[Verse 1: U-God]
Raw I'mma give it to ya, with no trivia
Raw like cocaine straight from Bolivia
My hip-hop will rock and shock the nation
Like the Emancipation Proclamation
Weak MC's approach with slang that's dead
You might as well run into the wall and bang your head
I'm pushing force, my force you're doubting
I'm making devils cower to the Caucus Mountains

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
Well I'm a sire, I set the microphone on fire
Rap styles vary, and carry like Mariah
I come from the Shaolin slum, and the isle I'm from
Is coming through with nuff niggas, and nuff guns
So if you wanna come sweating, stressing contesting
You'll catch a sharp sword to the midsection
Don't talk the talk, if you can't walk the walk
Phony niggas are outlined in chalk
I'm mad vexed, it's what the projects made me
Rebel to the grain there's no way to barricade me
Steamrolling niggas like a eighteen wheeler
With a drunk driver driving, there's no surviving

[Verse 3: Raekwon the Chef]
Rough like Timberland wear, yeah
Me and the Clan in 'Yota Landcruisers out there
Peace to all the crooks, all the niggas with bad looks
Bald heads, braids, blow this hook
We pack chrome Tecs, nickel plated Macs
Black Ac's, drug dealing styles in phat stacks
I only been a good nigga for a minute though
Cuz I got to get my props, and win it yo
I got beef wit commercial-ass niggas with gold teeth
Lamping in a Lexus eating beef
Straight up and down don't even bother
I got forty niggas up in here now, who kill niggas fathers

[Hook: Method Man]
My peoples are you with me where you at?
In the front, in the back killa-bees on attack
My peoples are you with me where you at?
Smoking meth hitting cats on the block with the gats

[Verse 4: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Here I go, deep type flow
Jacques Cousteau could never get this low
I'm cherry bombing shits... BOOM
Just warming up a little bit, vroom vroom
Rappining is what's happening
Keep the pockets stacked and then, hands clap and then
At the party when I move my body
Gotta get up and be somebody!
Grab the microphone put strength to the bone
DUH DUH DUH...enter the Wu-Tang zone
Sure enough when I rock that stuff
Huff? Puff? I'm gonna catch your bluff tuff
Rough, kicking rhymes like Jim Kelly
Or Alex Haley I'm a Mi-..Beetle Bailey rhymes
Coming raw style, hardcore
Niggas be coming to the hip-hop store
Coming to buy grocery from me
Trying to be a hip-hop MC
The law, in order to enter the Wu-Tang
You must bring the Ol' Dirty Bastard type slang
Represent the GZA, Abbot, RZA, Shaquan, Inspectah Deck
Dirty Ol' getting low wit his flow
Introducing, the Ghost..face.. Killah!!
No one could get iller

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Ghostface Killah]
Speaking of the devil psych, no it's the God, get the shit right
Mega trife, and yo I killed you in a past life
On the mic while you was kicking that fast shit
You reneged tried again, and got blasted
Half mastered ass style mad ruff task
When I struck I had on Timbs and a black mask
Remember that shit? I know you don't remember jack
That night yo I was hitting like a spiked bat
And then you thought I was bugged out, and crazy
Strapped for nonsense, after me became lazy
Yo, nobody budge while I shot slugs
Never shot thugs, I'm running with thugs that flood mugs
So grab your 8 plus 1, start flipping and tripping
Niggas is jetting I'm licking off son

[All]
Wu Tang Wu Tang Wu Tang Wu Tang!

[Verse 6: Masta Killa]
Homicide's illegal and death is the penalty
What justifies the homicide, when he dies
In his own iniquity it's the
Master of the Mantis Rapture coming at ya
We have an APB on an MC Killer
Looks like the work of a master
Evidence indicates that his stature
Merciless like a terrorist hard to capture
The flow, changes like a chameleon
Plays like a friend, and stabs you like a dagger
This technique attacks the immune system
Disguised like a lie paralyzing the victim
You scream, as it enters your bloodstream
Erupts your brain from the pain these thoughts contain
Moving on a nigga with the speed of a centipede
And injure any motherfucking contender!

[Hook][Produced by Tae Beast]

[Intro: Ash Riser]
We're far from good, not good from far
90 miles per hour down Compton Boulevard
With the top down, screaming, "We don't give a fuck!"
Drink my 40 ounce of freedom while I roll a blunt
Cause the kids just ain't alright

[Interlude: Ab-Soul]
Oh, shit nigga, somethin' 'bout to happen, nigga, this shit..
Nigga this sound like 30 ki's under the Compton court buildi'g
Hope the dogs don't smell it

[Verse 1]
Welcome to vigilante, 80's so don't you ask me
I'm hungry, my body's antsy, I rip through your fuckin' pantry
Peelin' off like a Xanny, examine my orchestra
Granny said when I'm old enough, I'll be sure to be all I can be
You niggas Marcus Camby, washed up
Pussy, fix your panties, I'm Mr. Marcus, you getting fucked, uh
You ain't heard nothin' harder since Daddy Kane
Take it in vain, Vicodins couldn't ease the pain
Lightnin' bolts hit your body, you thought it rained
Not a cloud in sight, just the shit that I write
Strong enough to stand in front of a travellin' freight train, are you trained?
To go against Dracula draggin' the record industry by my fangs
AK clips, money clips and gold chains
You walk around with a P90 like it's the 90's
Bullet to your temple, your homicide'll remind me that

[Hook]
Compton Crip niggas ain't nothin' to fuck with
Bompton Pirus ain't nothin' to fuck with
Compton éses ain't nothin' to fuck with
But they fuck with me, and bitch I love it
Woop de woop, woop de woop-woop, woop de woop
Woop de woop, woop de woop-woop (California Dungeons)
Woop de woop, woop de woop-woop, woop de woop
Woop de woop, woop de woop-woop (California Dungeons)

[Verse 2]
Let's hit the county buildin', gotta cash my check
Spend it all on a 40-ounce to the neck and
In retrospect I remember December being the hottest
Squad cars, neighborhood wars and stolen Mazdas
I tell you mothafuckas that life is full of hydraulics
Up and down, get a 64, better know how to drive it
I'm drivin' on E with no license or registration
Heart racin', racin' past Johnny because he's racist
1987, the children of Ronald Reagan raked the leaves off
Your front porch with a machine blowtorch (I'm really out here, my nigga)
He blowin' on stress, hopin' to ease the stress (Like, really out here)
He copping some blow, hopin' that it can stretch
Newborn massacre, hopping out the passenger
With calendars, cause your date's comin'
Run him down and then he gun him down, I'm hopin' that you fast enough
Even the legs of Michael Johnson don't mean nothin', because

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Can't detour when you're at war with your city, why run for?
Just ride with me, just die with me, that gun store, right there
When you fight, don't fight fair cause you'll never win, yeah

[Outro: Ab-Soul]
Right, I had the yapper, and I tore they ass up
We really out here, my nigga, you niggas don't understand, my nigga
I'm off of pill and Remy Red, my nigga, trippin', my nigga[Produced by RZA]

[Intro: Ol Dirty Bastard]
What y'all thought y'all wasn't gonna see me
I'm the Osiris of this shit
Wu-Tang is here forever, motherfuckers
This ninety-seven
Aight my niggas and my niggarettes
Let's do it like this
I'ma rub your ass in the moonshine
Let's take it back to seventy-nine

[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
I bomb atomically
Socrates' philosophies and hypotheses
Can't define how I be dropping these mockeries
Lyrically perform armed robbery
Flee with the lottery, possibly they spotted me
Battle-scarred Shogun, explosion when my pen hits
Tremendous, ultra-violet shine blind forensics
I inspect you, through the future see millennium
Killer Bees sold fifty gold, sixty platinum
Shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics
Graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths
Black Wu jackets Queen B's ease the guns in
Rumble with patrolmen, tear gas laced the function
Heads by the score take flight incite a war
Chicks hit the floor, die hard fans demand more
Behold the bold soldier, control the globe slowly
Proceeds to blow, swinging swords like Shinobi
Stomp grounds and pound footprints in solid rock
Wu got it locked, performing live on your hottest block

[Verse 2: Method Man]
As the world turns, I spread like germs
Bless the globe with the pestilence
The hard-headed never learn
It's my testament to those burned
Play my position in the game of life standing firm
On foreign land jump the gun out the frying pan into the fire
Transform into the Ghost Rider
A six-pack and a streetcar named desire
Who got my back in the line of fire holding back what
My peoples if you with me where the fuck you at
Niggas is strapped and they trying to twist my beer cap
Is court adjourned for the bad seed from bad sperm
Herb got my wig fried like a bad perm, what the blood
Clot, we smoke pot and blow spots
You want to think twice, I think not
The Iron Lung ain't got to tell you where it's coming from
Guns of Navarone, tearing up your battle zone
Rip through your slums

[Verse 3: Cappadonna]
I twist darts from the heart, tried and true
Loop my voice on the LP, martini on the slang rocks
Certified chatterbox, vocabulary 'Donna talking
Tell your story walking
Take cover kid what
Run for your brother kid
Run for your team and your "six can't rhyme" groupies
So I can squeeze with the advantage and get wasted
My deadly notes reigns supreme
Your fort is basic compared to mine
Domino effect, arts and crafts
Paragraphs contain cyanide
Take a free ride on my thought I got the fashion
Catalogs for all y'all to all praise due to God

[Interlude: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
The saga continues
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang

[Verse 4: U-God]
Olympic torch flaming, we burn so sweet
The thrill of victory, the agony of defeat
We crush slow, flaming deluxe slow
For judgment day cometh, conquer it's war
Allow us to escape, hell glow spinning bomb
Pocket full of shells out the sky, Golden Arms
Tunes split the shitty Mortal Kombat sound
The fateful step make, the blood stain the ground
A jungle junkie, vigilante tantrum
A death kiss, catwalk, squeeze another anthem
Hold it for ransom, tranquilized with anesthesias
My orchestra, graceful, music ballerinas
My music Sicily, rich California smell
The axe kill adventure, paint a picture well
I sing a song from Sing-Sing, sipping on ginseng
Righteous wax chaperone, rotating ring kings

[Verse 5: RZA]
March of the wooden soldiers
C-Cypher-Punks couldn't hold us
A thousand men rushing in, not one nigga was sober
Perpendicular to the square we stamp gold like Fleer
Escape from your dragon's lair in particular
My beats travel like a vortex through your spine
To the top of your cerebral cortex
Make you feel like you bust a nut from raw sex
Enter through your right ventricle clog up your bloodstream
Now terminal like Grand Central Station
Program fat bass lineson Novation
Getting drunk like a fuck, I'm ducking five-year probation

[Verse 6: GZA]
War of the masses, the outcome disastrous
Many of the victim family save they ashes
A million names on walls engraved in plaques
Those who went back received penalties for their acts
Another heart is torn as close ones mourn
Those who stray, niggas get slayed on the song

[Verse 7: Masta Killa]
The track renders helpless and suffers from multiple stab wounds
And leaks sounds that's heard
Ninety-three million miles away from came one
To represent the Nation, this is a gathering
Of the masses that come to pay respects to the Wu-Tang Clan
As we engage in battle, the crowd now screams in rage
The high chief Jamel-I-Reef takes the stage
Light is provided through sparks of energy
From the mind that travels in rhyme form
Giving sight to the blind
The dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
Death only one can save self from
This relentless attack of the track spares none

[Verse 8: Ghostface Killah]
Yo Yo Yo, fuck that, look at all these crab niggas laid back
Lamping like them gray and black Puma's on my man's rack
Codeine was forced in your drink
You had a Navy green salamander fiend, bitches overheard you scream
You two-faces, scum of the slum, I got your whole body numb
Blowing like Shalamar in eighty-one
Sound convincing, thousand dollar cord by convention
Hands like Sonny Liston, get fly permission
Hold the fuck up, I'll unfasten your wig, bad luck
I humiliate, separate the English from the Dutch
It's me, black, Noble Drew Ali
Came in threes we like the Genovese, is that so
Caesar needs the greens, it's Earth
Ninety-three million miles from the first
Rough turbulence, the wave burst, split the megahertz

[Verse 9: Raekwon]
Aiyyo that's amazing, gun in your mouth talk, verbal foul hawk
Connect thoughts to make my man child walk
Swift notarizer, Wu-Tang, all up in the high-riser
New York Yank visor world tranquilizer
Just a dosage, delegate my Clan with explosives
While my pen blow lines ferocious
Mediterranean, see y'all, the number one draft pick
Tear down the beat God, then delegate the God to see God
The swift chancellor, flex the white gold tarantula
Track truck diesel, play the weed God substantiala
Max mostly, undivided then slide in sickening
Guaranteed made em jump like Rod Strickland[Verse 1: GZA]
Bobby said, "Fuck spending fifty on a whip, buy equip"
Mental flip, he got a thousand tracks stored on a chip
Said he had mad toys to make noise
He split and separate drums like asteroids
The concerned producer sampled this question
Hit him with the beat for the answer with extra compression
My sound travel, it quickly grab you
And equalize the pitch up, until it have you
Bugged out, tryna think you can match this
The portraits are too graphic
Panoramic view for you, stamp Wu
The beats are Gothic, the outcome will be catastrophic
We roadblocked it, checkpoints on your next joint
Now who the nigga you anoint?
700 volts on the track to slay
Murderous wordplay displayed from killing cascades
Throwing bullets in the air to test wind
Which way the cyclone spin? Counter or clockwise?
Still civilized
Kill spies on the wall as still flies, all dies

[Verse 2: Masta Killa]
Give no extension on the lynching
It's tension if the name of the Clan is mentioned
It's the aura that's felt that causes one to flash his gun
And reveal how he really feel, confirmed
He'll never live after the show
See the promoter for the dough I'm taking, breaking his wax
Throwing my shit on to perform the selection from the Swarm
Day 2 breaks, it's a stormy Monday
My ninjas lay in ravines and ditches underneath shrubs and leaves
They breathed through underwater reefs
The enemy walks above, Clan remains subterraned in mud
Off shore banks, tanks approach the location
Bombarded by the circle of death formation
Telecom lines are sniped from these low altitude strikes
Shattering bulletproof helmets with shrapnel fragments of cell
Inhale these venomous thoughts that I propel
Through the north facility, the city must suffer
At the hand of the Chief's command, volts are sent
At three minute intervals the heat intenses
Deadening the power from electrical fences
Defences are down, shake a nigga up
Bounce him off the sound

[Interlude: Killah Priest of Sunz Of Man]
You know what I'm saying?
The God ca-diver, in the streets of Iris
We talk about sex, money and drugs
(Ruled by power) And y'all cats don't know
What it's about (Love and power)
It goes deeper than what you see on TV
Killah Priest, come on

[Verse 3: Killah Priest]
Burning desire, ebony eyes
Painted toenails, legacies die
Women by the well, Egyptian queens
Arabian sheiks paid to knock off rich kings for the joy some sing
Graveyards filled with scarlet widows
Who stabbed they husbands sleeping on silk pillows
Blood on they robes, disguised as beggar in cheap wool clothes
Lambs and wolves in black hoods pull out they gats
Like magic wands, casting spells, sending niggas to Hell
Trapping they souls in realms
Baptize them with Holy Water
Springing on the heads of plenty witches' daughters
Interviews with the richest reporters, silent nights over Nevada
A thousand Muslims bow before the Kaaba
Hebrews flee to the hills of Masada
For the love of God, guns make a loud sound
I'mma show you how thugs get down
Shootouts, bullets turn into bloodhounds and hunt you down
Cursed nation, lost generation
X-Files found them in the future as cosmic rulers
Fallen angels from space intruders
Dying saints, blood spilled on the floor like wet paint
See it in the pictures, read it like the lost scriptures
Absorb it with your 100 proof liquor

[Verse 4: Njeri Earth]
I shot the sheriff and the deputy secondly
Threatening the lives of those who threaten me
Lessening my chances of defeat by predetermining the victory
As taught by Sun Tzu in the chapter, after the third one
I heard my word shall be born, regardless to anything or anyone
Or else I die by the gun, my life has just begun
Thought I was living all along, but I was wrong
This long road I have to travel in countless battles
These filthy snakes with poison fangs and rattles
Kings, queens and pharaohs change to cattle
Unable to duck the Devil's arrow
Singing that his eye's on the sparrow, mind narrow
Superstitions, horoscopes and tarots
'Hark Heralds Angels' and Christmas carols
Graven images hang from the mantels
Man-made slaves in modern day Babel
Brought from Africa in golden robes and sandals
By wicked thieves and vandals
Who manhandled us with leather whips and burning candles
And rambled through our castle, leaving niggas shambles
Stole our golden sodas like some Arab camels
We gazed, amazed and baffled as he loaded his ammo
Into the barrel and blasted out our bone marrow
We were the Gretel and the Hansel, tricked by this wicked jackal
Children of my grand-old-daddy have me
In mind when they're lost in this wilderness blind[Intro: Method Man]

[Method Man]
Somebody said it's on, if it is then I'll be set
To blow a nigga up, with my Five Fingers of Death
I bring it to his whole damn fam, understand
If he frontin, on any man down with the Clan
I be comin, for that headpiece you can't cope
For my brother, I even kill a Pope, word to mother
Serial, killa, style from the Isle of Stat
My peoples are you with me where you at?
Shit's gettin deep in here, I mean like thick
Niggas lookin all in my face like they want dick
It's about to hit the fan, hit the flo'
That's all I can stands, and I can't stands no mo'
What is it? Niggas think they bigga
Because they got the finga on the trigga of a biscuit
They don't know I'm wicked, when I start to kick it
With the raw sound, wash it down with a Mystic
Better yet a Snapple, nigga want the juice
But he don't want the hassle
Thought they trying to overthrow the castle
Better yet the temple, I'm comin to your town
Black down, the rental, car, the pistol
YAH! If you don't want a burn from Glock
Then beware, I buck shots, meaning what, the buck stops
Here, no more dough will be made
Unless it's being made by who... the 1-6-Ooh

I'm the original G-O-D
Making young ladies scream is my specialty
When I go ooh-wah, ooh-wah, ooh-wah, girls wanna get hype
From the funky fresh music that was stereotyped
When I kill, that ol' mad rugged flow
Not sayin Ason, is like a duck of disco
Or a disco duck, I'm strictly hip hop
Yo, Ason, what's up? I can't stop...
Wu-Tanging, flipping the script and
You could test my skills, but niggas must be trippin
Coked up from sniffin, you're the one who's riffin
I'm not Opie, save that old shit for Andy Griffith
You start to flip, now ya slip, cuz you're slippin
While you sleep I be the God on point, like Scottie Pippen
As I, jump on stage, cold flip a rip a show
Strip or rip a ho, ready like Bo
Jackson while I'm still taxin, I'm maxin
Relaxin, sittin backs and, laying tracks and
Again and again when I rock this jam
I wanna see 'em up in the air, throw up your hand
Introducin, the one-man band
A child that's wild, now with the style, couldn't stand
Niggas wanna jump, then stepped, to the center
Of the rhyme inventor, MC tormentor
You get jacked and slapped, across the MC map
I laugh at ya ass, on a horse shack
Come on through I black and blue your whole crew
Then I get rudie with the Hong Kong Phooey
The Ol' Dirty Bastard, MC killer
Money maker, Brooklyn, Shaolin style
That I lay down like tile
Gotta hit you up, one blaow, so you better come down...* international bonus track

I live life lavish and my chain is karats
The last name on the train to Paris
Used to be lame
Then attained the merit
So many clothes
Can't name the fabrics
Dynamics
I want the fame
And my name engraved in granites
Here's his lane
Now came to grab it
You moving sideways
Change your habits
Used to rock minks
Then I changed to rabbit
From out the garbage
I came from average
Used to be righteous
That changed to savage
Bang my ratchet like Bangkok
Dangerous
36 Chamber fist
Trianglist
Watch me mangle this
Star Spanglist
Rock cowboy
Wrangler
Creating mega-hits
I'm from the grain
Game at my fingertips

[Cappadonna]
Yeah! Killa Hill lay it down!
Killa Bees on the swarm!
Nigga
Ayyo I plow down ? like I'm out for revenge
Fuck it
It seems like the drama never ends
Be in the projects
Like I never left out
Might be on Osgood
See a nigga stretched out
I can't take it
Seems like my hood is cursed
Bad niggas
I thought that the good was first
My old whore
She march with a foul parade
Don't learn shit
Til another child is sprayed
I'm out here
Fuck it
Like I live on ? and Rico
Keep a low cut like Margie
I don't give a fuck
Y'all made me bitter
I'mma whip your kids out like a babysitter
I'mma grown man
But I'm young in the mind state
Live in every burrough
But New York my tri-state
Test me
You know I brought a bitch on the tour bus
Pour piss on you, leave you stuck for 4 months
My head fucked up
I'm off my clean streak
Don't make me pick the 9's up
I come from mean seeds
My unit snitched on me
Ratted me out
They all ganged up on me
Tried to take my mouth
However the cause I'm in jail and get ?
They cut from dirty cloth
I'm cut from cement
Original ?
Got the crazy glow
Them devils tried to jump me
I'm crazy though
Absolut Vodka rat
Crush mad Goose
O.G. all day
Like I be on the deuce
Pop off with it
Get your army in order

Yeah
Told 'em
"Have Gun--Will travel"
?
Black son spill gravel
Bronze Man
Oblong javelins in my cabinet
Detroit ?
Salutations from the missile plant
Quick to the hollowpoint
It ain't no olive branch
My low-cal 4 0 cal. in the cardigan
Tempted by Satan
Put a bullet in his diaphragm
Walk around
Black clouds and quiet violins
A tire fire blends poet and violent pens
Illest skill
Got steel ? and iron winds
Uphill need a ghetto ?
Street dreams
Black ? aspire kings
For fire water veins
Still ? Listerine
They chains through to my "Roots"
No doubt
Ben Verne
On the road to riches and diamond speech
I might turn ? mountain peaks

[RZA]
Yo
I don't text to send messages
My testosterone stimulate her estrogen
Whether Black, Caucasian or the Mexican
Asian
She get the message
And she coming back for sex again
Organic drugs
My natural persuasion
You under the influence of 36 invasion
Spider-man amazing
But I'm darker then Parker
Skin got abrasions from ?
Sliding down the street cold
Pull up to your party stimulated with a Jeep full
Of ? gap honeys and bottles of vodka
Plus the weed rollsss
Here we go
Mediating
Never jealous
Over zealous
Wu Tang's my fellowship
Fans mash up accapellas of our lyrics with Beatle tracks embellishes
The idea clearly that Wu-Tang forever
This way of life
Is art, rhymes and cleverness
Joined by God
No man can sever this
I complete jobs
Free and effortless
Use tiger, crane
Snake style
Plus the leopard fistCat I got to take him off of here, that's right
I got to take him off of here
Cause there's only one, and that's me
You understand? 'fore all that fighting, you understand
That sucka think he good, that sucka think he can whoop me
And I know he can't whoop me, I...
Ay boy, the nigga whole style is chump
You understand?
Let me get mines first
Then after I get mines, you can do what you want to do...

[Ghostface]
Yeah, scandalous
Yeah miraculous, the arsonists

Yo, kicked down the door in the spot, 260
2L, I heard they had O's for sale
I heard the same shit, money drive a burgundy whip
Keep it low, faded license plates and great plate
Where's the cat from, think he's from New Jerusalem
Pretty Rick did his thing for him, but he was using him
Boss Sun's younger physical, you know the God
He go with Tip, the one who called Lover of God
Why Equality Self, I know the Master Allah Now
It's time to get the God U and blow like mines
But on the low I heard he got Born Original sent
Back in a drive-through Kentucky Fried shot up his Ac
We got to get him dun, aliens is snatching our bread
UFOs moving in with bigger plans than Feds, yo
Knock on Daddy-O's door get the scope
He's not home, he took Ishmael to Park Slope
There go the the dreads yo, swindle two bags of that skunk
That get you crashed out had you laid out like bums
Peace Kiana, what's up with your girlfriend Wanda
She drive a cream Honda, with legs like Jane Fonda
I just left her, she took Regine to Pathmark then
Jetted to Canal to get her man some Clarks
She should be back in ninety minutes, Ghostface
God forbid she safe, BCW was watching the kids

[Raekwon]
Two hours later, scheming like DeNiro in Casino
Son better have more coke than Al Pacino
Kiana ain't telling no lies, last year she did a sting and a half
With Tymeek bought him a aircraft
But anyway, yo, Daddy-O home, we need the shotties nid-ow
When we get back, throw you a thid-ou
Later that night, stay mesmerized yo
Go get the green 5, meet you on the corner of Now Why
You ready, you got the E&J and the machete?
We going upstairs, I hope one nigga is heavy
We walked in, both of us, looked like terrorists
Masks on, second floor, dun yo, I handle this
Kick in the crib, the whole shit looked graphical
Natural, fucking a white bitch, actual
Fiends chanting, "Do your thing Chef, handle it"
I shot him in the neck, it ricocheted and hit Carolyn
Ran to the back analyzing, much disguising
Surprise is coming in their eyes and tranquilizing
Bugging, throwing the twin cousins at his nugget, fuck it
Meet shottie waddy slug body hobby
Where the drugs, where the ounces you be bouncing
Fake cats announcing on the block, you lounging
Where the blow at, I ain't got shit, stop fronting
(Yo Chef, throw the joint in his mouth, money'll stop stunting
Bitch, hold that pit, before I push your wig back
Chef stop waving that, show him where the paper at)
Come here Valerie, you know the God he need a salary
Put down the pipe here's two tickets to a coke gallery
It's in the kitchen in the ceiling
(Baby girl kept squealing
Only found a white block of cheese from New Zealand
Ohhh shit! Yo, yo where that shit at yo?
Yo Chef, where that shit? What? What? Aiyyo...)[Verse 1: Rev. William Burk]
Yo, what’s todays Mathematics?
Two plus square
The truth is the only light
Nigga stand by himself
In the surrounding of darkness
There’ll be no disc shining
In the square of the universe
Which is 360 degrees
When God builds he (?)
Perpendicular to a square

[Hook: Truth Hurts]
Hate you on a daily
Man this shit is crazy
It ain't worth what we (?) you
Sippin’ ‘till I’m cloudy
Just so I can maintain
Cause loving you is like wearing two left shoes
Cause loving you is like wearing two left shoes
Cause loving you is like wearing two left shoes
Cause loving you is like wearing two left shoes

[Verse 2: RZA]
I love my niggas to death, down to the last breath
But the last breath, I'm gonna save for myself
You (?)
Only come around when they need you
Savages, biting off the hands that feed you
Come among the righteous trying to spread that evil
Blinded by the love all these years but now I see you
For who you be and what you are to me
Tip a ray magnet trying to get a charge off me
In the old days, I would give a charge for free
But now a day, I’m charging you $100 g’s
Wu tang is permanent
I’m the illuminated (?)
Known to chops heads off at the hip hop tournament

[Hook: Truth Hurts]
Hate you on a daily
Man this shit is crazy
It ain't worth what we (?) you
Sippin’ ‘till I’m cloudy
Just so I can maintain
Cause loving you is like wearing two left shoes
Cause loving you is like wearing two left shoes
Cause loving you is like wearing two left shoes
Cause loving you is like wearing two left shoes

[Third Verse: RZA]
From a small water cacoon
Bent to the shape of a quarter moon
A small water pack that’s placed above the womb
I was fashioned by Allah’s
All men are created equal
Then tricked with wicked lies that separated the people
Then escaped to (?)
(?)
Someone tried to shoot Mister Robert Fitzgerald
The supreme original intelligent
The Prince RZA
Somehow mistake me for a old wise wizard
I put love up against anything
I put love upon the angel wings
I put love beyond the diamond rings
With true love nothing should come between

[Hook: Truth Hurts]
Hate you on a daily
Man this shit is crazy
It ain't worth what we (?) you
Sippin’ ‘till I’m cloudy
Just so I can maintain
Cause loving you is like wearing two left shoes
Cause loving you is like wearing two left shoes
Cause loving you is like wearing two left shoes
Cause loving you is like wearing two left shoesWhen they ask for it, never tell ‘em no. Let it go
Put a pen to the pad—it’s an effervescent flow
Definitely know—I’m a product of the era I was brought up in—
Competition slaughtering for fun
Might’ve mentioned guns as a shorty for attention
Not to say they wasn’t in my area, but listen
My competition, they never wanted me dead
They wanted decapitation, they saw that I was ahead
Heard that I told tales, knew that I did it well
Sisyphusean descriptions—I live in my own Hell

It’s populated by heat that I hand make—flip a coin—
No matter how it lands, where you’re going—
Is through they alleyways, back blocks, tenements
Where if he don’t call a girl a bitch, he’s a gentleman
Misogyny expected—Sodom and Gomorrah
Scary movie mind state—the problem ain’t the horror

In the movies, we die in the first scene
So we’re all really Drew Barrymore in the first Scream
Only it’s set in Harlem, maybe it’s in Detroit
The audience prays you don’t turn around—it ain’t The Voice
You fall as you’re running to get away—
Felonious metaphor, you do a year and a day
Or die trying
Lie silent
Crack infested—surrounded by thirst, it’s Rock Island
From 217 to 309, niggas open they rhyme books up and bleed on lines
Hope for some recognition—to cheat on dimes
Ladies like Changing Faces, and we don’t mind

Bars over the head like snatch lifts
Dope boy antithesis—rhyme with a back flip
Flip back one chapter, finish the exposition—
Juice, on the roof, I’m standing right next to Bishop;
Raheem’s dead and Steel got shot—
We all know how the story ends—still I watch
Excited to see the violence—destined to See It Through
Kinda funny, back in school, I pledged: I’m a Q

Grew up in the era of ass whooppins
Switches, belts, knuckles for mad lookin’
Bus transfers, bummy and bad lookin’
Lunchtime ciphers, dice get cash tooken

C-Style—A-dot, kind of the same guy—
Aries and Virgo—we should have been Gemini
Cause since shorties it was just him and I
Talking more shit than a little bit
Ignorant
Wasn’t all good, but I choose how to remember it
Mention it cause he sent me the track for me to spit to it
97 Canibus, jaw dropped listening;
Nobody spit like he did, and it’s been a minute since
I had inspiration—so I listened closely
Wondered what I’d say in conversation with the old me

“Stop drinking, pig is a filthy animal
If an elephant’s in the room, then you should be Hannibal
Scribble down in your notebook all you can manage to
Wait ten years, then publish it as the manual.”[Intro: RZA (Method Man)]
Roll that shit, light that shit, smoke it (roll it up niggas)
Roll that shit, light that shit, smoke it (4:20, y'all, it's time, it's time)
Roll that shit, light that shit, smoke it (it's been a long time for this man
Niggas been sleeping on the kid, man, everybody got some sideway shit to say)
Roll that shit, light that shit, smoke it (Carlo! Know what I'm saying, man? Yeah)

[Method Man]
Fast or slow mo, oh no, Meth done made a killing
Call the po-po, oh niggas is squealing, oh, y'all ain't feeling
Niggas no more, the bigger they are, harder they go though
Good pussy put a hump in my back like Quasimoto
Hah, my sex ain't homo, season vet, hold the adobo
Got rappers on that low carb diet, y'all can't get no dough
I keep a low pro, file, excuse me as I get smoked out
Put hands on these niggas, then put the roach out
Go head, I'm wishing you would, ask if it's good
Man, this Tarzan shit in the woods, my shit is hood, bitch
That means I'm hood rich, telling you lies
Straight out the pull-pit, it's like Merrill Lynch I'm on that bullshit
Real spit, money come first, and even worse
You need all your toes & fingers to count up what I'm worth, trick
So when I blow a smoke cloud in your face, just take a hint
Dick, you crowding my space, it's Mr. Meth, pa

[Hook: Carlton Fisk]
It's 4:20, roll up, nigga getting smo-ked out
No seeds, California weed have you choked out
No doubt, roll up, which rims spoked out
4:20 mean either you roll up or roll out

[RZA]
Roll that shit, light that shit, smoke it
Roll that shit, light that shit, smoke it

[Method Man]
So on and so on, I flow on
Power to our people, get your smoke on
And I'm so gone, off, that sour diesel
Hard to hold on, but hold on, it's like I'm Pretty Toney
With that robe on, got terrorist shook, because I'm so bomb
The hood, put, me in position, I'm in the kitchen
With that cook book, the service I'm giving, birds they vision
Not a good look, told ya my nigga, Tical deliver
Hook or crook, lots of asses to kick, wish I had a bigger foot
Yeah, taking it there, hating who care
Y'all stay out my mental, I got killas waiting in here
To get you, as I sharpen my pencils, tear apart instrumentals
Fuck it, y'all niggas is pussy, so is the dick that sent you
RZA, we done it again, Co-D occassion
Here's to short skirts and Ol' Dirt McGirt, okay, then
Let's get it popping, like it ain't nothing to get it popping
The big and rotten's the city, too good to be forgotten

[Hook] - 2X

[Streetlife]
The rap game won't like me
You can tell that a nigga is shiesty
If I die, my second born'll be like me
Slide dick to your wifey
Never know your baby boy just might be
Quick to rob a jack, he's so icey, stay dressed to kill
From the Hill, never ran, never will
Attitude, like, fuck you still, I see you missing the point
This is not a rap song, you get clapped on
Bullets break the bone, like the joint, call you out your name
Disrespect ya moms, spit on your dame
Go public, then, shit on your fame, you overlooking the fact
Where you from, is where we at
And y'all don't want no, parts, in that that
Caught your verse for sale, but real niggas don't shoot & tell
We'd rather do the time and rot in the cell

[Carlton Fisk]
The inner outer state, bi-coastal smoker
Inhale, Cali piff with a swift of glaucoma
Black jeans, black Timbs, black Benz roaster
Smoke rise, out the sun roof when I roll up
Verrazano, with no relation to Gravano
Carlo, shots are hollow, still cop a bottle
And pour some out, moment of silence, then I swallow
I'm still alive, and still the sun'll come out tomorrow
Shine shine shine, and grind, cuz it's money on my mind
And I'm moving like my life is on the line
For the bullshit, I really got no time, a full clip
Really gon' let ya niggas know what's on my mind
When ya getting out of line, have them choppers lit up
You won't need a camera phone to get the picture
Chalk down, tape around, body bag zipped up
Carlo Verrazano, you can call me mister

[Hook][Blue Raspberry ohh-ing in the back through whole song except verses]

[Intro/Outro: Forest Whitaker]
The way of the samurai is found in death
Meditation of inevitable death should be performed daily
Every day, when one's body and mind are at peace
He should meditate up on being up to blocked
By arrows, rifles, spears and swords
Being carried away by surging waves
Being thrown in to the midst of a great fire
Being struck by a lightning, and shaken to death by a great earthquake
Falling from thousand foot cliffs, dying of a disease
Commiting seppiku at the death of one's master
In everyday when one fails, one should consider himself as dead
This is a substance of the way of a samurai

[Christ Bearer]
Nigga I don't wanna talk
I own one, ghost gun, briefcase in this equilibrium
It's the killa on your block, melodic flux
War flock, of perfected, dead it, bloods chop it up
And the birds of a feather, fly together
Intellaced moving mo' murder messages of me and Leatha Face
I'm your retainer, your perfect stranger
36th Chamber, Wu-Tang banga
I hit the dust and bust a straight no braina
Heavyweight gaina, and a lone blown ranger
Welcome to the world I rock
Doing what in the cut, while niggas know not
Grand theft, awaited with baited breath
Hear witnesses fear just as clear as death
In the twinklin of an eye, in the ways of the samurai
It's do or die, for the devil's pie
Now I'm phat broad down, received from mo' high
So beautiful it make you wanna cry, cry, cry
Power Equality, Ghost Dog
For Christ Bearer, Killa Bees, west coast God

[Hook: RZA]

[Minky, (RZA)]
Ah, designed to cause disaster, the mic blaster
Cause atoms to transfer, with immediate report for you bastards
I make minds stagger, with this North Star golden dagger
I self Lord and master, represented in this chapter
For you phony wild actors, I crack ya
For tryin to distract us, in the west
Transportin flows of energy in your chest
Over deep bass tones, in the flesh
Odd bones are rock clones
Repentance in the devil home cuz he divided the whole globe
Transform souls, told lies, we wrote scrolls
Now it's on, it's bid war
360 degrees that form the negative swarm
Born mentally and physically from the essence
Where North Star be flexin, questin, addressing
All minds that's hectic, no place to be
North Star trilogy, west coast Killa Bee
(Killa Who?) Killa Bee, (Killa Who?) Killa Bee
Killa Bee, (Killa Who?) Killa Bee

[Intro/Outro][Intro: LP version only]
Choose the sword, and you will join me
Choose the ball, and you join your mother... in death
You don't understand my words, but you must choose
{*baby gurgling*}
So... come boy, choose life or death

[Verse One: Ghostface Killah]
The only man a ho wait for
Is the sky-blue Bally kid, in '83 rocked Tale Lords
My Memorex performed tape decks, my own phone sex
Watch out for Haiti bitches, I heard they throw hex
Yo, Wu whole platoon is filled with raccoons
Corner-sitting wine niggas sipping Apple Boone
This ain't no white cartoon
Cos I be ducking crazy spades
The kid hold white shit like blacks rock ashy legs
Why is the sky blue? Why is water wet?
Why did Judas rat to Romans while Jesus slept?
Stand up, you're out of luck like two dogs stuck
Ironman be sipping rum, out of Stanley Cups, unflammable
Noriega, aiming nozzles stay windy in Chicago
Spine-tingle, mind boggles
Kangols in rainbow colors, promoters try to hold dough
Give me mine before Po wrap you up in so-and-so
I ran the Dark Ages, Constantine the Great, Henry the 8th
Built with Genghis Khan, the red suede Wally Don

[Verse Two: Killah Priest]
I judge wisely as if nothing ever surprise me
Lounging between two pillars of ivory
I'm lively, my dome piece is like building stones in Greece
Our poems are deep, from ancient thrones I speak
I'm overwhelmed as my mind roams the realm
My eye's the visions, memory is the film
Others act sub-tile, but they fragile above cloud
They act wild and couldn't budge a crowd
No matter how loud they get, though they growl and spit
Clutch they fists and throw up signs like a Crip
And throw all types of fit
I leave them split like ass cheeks and ragged pussy lips

[Verse Three: RZA]
Aiyo, camouflage chameleon, ninjas scaling your building
No time to grab the gun, they already got your wife and children
A hit was sent from the President to raid your residence
Because you had secret evidence and documents
On how they raped the continents and lynched the prominent
Dominant Islamic, Asiatic black Hebrew
The year 2002 the battle's filled with the Wu
Six million devils just died from the Bubonic Flu
Or the Ebola virus, under the reign of King Cyrus
You can see the weakness of a man right through his iris
Unloyal snakes get thrown in boiling lakes of hot oil
Up boils your skin, chickenheads getting slim like Olive Oyl
Only plant the seed deep inside fertile soil
Fortified with essential vitamin and minerals
Use the sky for a blanket, stuffing clouds inside my pillow
Rolling with the Lamb, Twelve Tribes a 144, 000 chosen
Protons Electrons Always Cause Explosions

[Verse Four: The Genius/GZA]
The banks a G, all CREAM downs a bet
Money feed good, opposites off the set
It ain't hard to see, my seeds need God-degree
I got mouths to feed, unnecessary beef is more cows to breed
I'm on some tax-free shit by any means
Whether bounty-hit scheme or some counterfeit CREAM
I learned much from such swift cons who run scams
Veterans got the game spiced like ham
And from that, sons are born and guns are drawn
Clips are fully loaded and then blood floods the lawn
Disciplinary action was a fraction of strength
That made me truncate the length one-tenth
Woofers thump, tweeters hiss like air pumps
RZA shaved the track, niggas caught razor bumps
Scarred trying to figure who invented
These unprecedented, opium-scented, dark-tinted
Now watch me blow him out his shoes without clues
Cause I won't hesitate to detonate, I'm short fused[Intro: Poetic]
Sup this is the Gravedigga jam session (add a little riff)
What's today's date? (Today's the 20th) (Friday)
The 20th of May, 1994
We chillin in GLC studios
And we gonna go like this
Got my man BB Frukwan (look at the riff)

Hook:
G-to-the-R-to-the-A-to-the-V
E-to-the-D-to-the-I-to-the-G
G-to-the-A-to-the-zig-zag-Z
Gravedigga, nigga, 6 feet deep
(x2)

Verse One: Grymreaper
I floss my teeth on a gospel track
I'm not an apostle, but I bring the axe to ya back
I chew and attack
Like Crest on plaque
After that, your world is black
You drop into a hole
Your mold separates from your soul
Behold, the Gravediggaz told you 'Beware'
But you didn't listen
So now we appear eardrums glisten, ha ha

Hook

Verse Two: Gatekeeper
When I wreck I commence to detect
Ready to dissect so come step alive and die
Next murder is mayhem
Diggin graves is a regular
Treach-orous mangler
Tha Boston Strangler
Heated and trapped in a fury of hate
Daredevil, the rhyme rebel my art terminates
Subduin and pul-ver-i-zin ya head
You bled, fell dead, and your tomb-stone read
Rza-to-the-recta, Grym-to-the-reap
Unda-to-the-taker, Gate-to-the-keep
Creepin thru tha ghettos and the slums and streets
Gravedigga, nigga, 6 feet

Verse Three: Rzarector
Darkness shall fall upon y'all
Who slept on the styles
That crept thru tha door
The grave, behave, we come to save
So don't be afraid of the dark
We spark like light in night
Excite, excite is right, is right
Come follow the light
And see what I see and be what I be
Tha G-to-the-R-to-the-A-to-the-V...E

Hook

Verse Four: Gatekeeper
In the mind I come with the sparks from the attic
Yet psychopathic brain tracks is tragic
Twist lifting wrist like riff of a Taurus
Deep in tha forest, I slay for tha porridge
Yet it's cold, ya die slow like a tortoise
Deep in my chorus, ya result Diggamortis
Let me see I'm castin disease
Contrary, yet some fairy cause ya bleed

Hook

Verse Five: Rzarector
Demonic, the sonnet is bangin like chronic
And niggas be audi faster than Sonic
Bubonic, plutonic ya best up on it
Beats bein programmed ASR Ensoniq
Styles compiled for miles and childs
Bodies in aisles and upside-down smiles
Reflect, catch wreck from sun-moon sect
Revenants shines light then thought reflects

Hook

Verse Six: Grymreaper
I came on the scene
In a wheel that Ezekiel seen
To exploit your flaws like Philistines
Look in the sky, oh my, it is I
No alibi, so don't even try to feed me swine
And Grymreaper's mind is so refined
I'm deep, I'm deep, I'm deep
As a hill or a cliff or a steep
Incline at the bottom of an ocean reef[RZA]
Yeah, start wit that one
Yo, yo, yo, my acustic futuristic lingustic rap fabric
Is a mixture of Arabic sandscript in it's italics
I talk quick, y'all bitches can't comprehend my dick release spit
Wit love should I release hits
We travel through bodies like blood vessels
All y'all crab niggas try to wrestle to be on top of this pedastool
Slang doctrine, minoxin, lyrical toxin, I'm chessboxin
Words is rushin through like a herd of angry OXEN!!

[Cappadonna]
Fatal for these pussy cat niggas is dead weight
Concentrate, my murder rate excellerate, terminate
So spoil like coke in the foil
Knock knock, I shot the whole block
Electricity, flow splendidly
Internally inside of me like Tony Starks tee
I create excellency, one-sixty call L-O-U-N-G assist me
Papi wardrobe is key, roll promptly
For slang hall, vocabulary Igor, Frankenstein mind
Rewind for a minute while I dig down your track, stupid
I move quick shit is accurate, Kojack tactics
Chaos, killa bee minds, high society blackness, spread the rumor

[RZA]
My lyrical marv-el makin more cream than Carvel
Y'all niggas best to hold your weight like barbell
To my verbal swordsman school, students don't play truant
My most prudent pupil, rhyme under influence
Of alcohol and to-bacco, mushrooms imported from Morocco
Bellies on the rocks, and a twenty sack of choco
Wit forty tales and gold around the fist, bitch I carve
Glitters on the paper so my family won't starve

[Cappadonna]
I'm deep in the shit, I stay highly involved
Never inconceited, never been beated
Been trapped in many wars but not yet retreated
My style you need it, I just write to read it
It's all fresh lyric, no nothing gets repeated
I came a long way and guess what, I succeeded
I conquer my opponent, and feed him baby food
Cuz he's childish and illiterate, and ye has been rude
To the father year me, O-R-I-G
Respond to the war wit the killa bee law

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Scavenger nigga, you's a shhriimp
A full line of shhiit, my ear can digest iiit
Stop drinkin all that water, let's take it to the land
So I can Godzilla up your shit mister Tiny Tim man
Niggas be creepin up my beanstalk
When I start to come down on your fuckin ass
You tried to chop shit on up
Played my shit like parks bitch, I'm that

[RZA]
Legendary microphone's weaponary
You secondary BITCH-ASS fairies
Scary cats won't survive this verbal attack
You think you're slang can match
The Wu-Tang, EMPHATICALLY now cypher
You fake crumbs, you should be stung on your tongue
While you young guns bunge, we plunge into the grunge
Deep into the dark dungeon, we come in one wind
Nine minds combine to form the wisest rhyme force to summon
I be the quoted mathematical combination
Unloadin mysteries of life, you feel my solar wind blowin

[Cappadonna]
Just then, I came on the stage like wind
Blew slang in your face and it touch your skin
You felt chilly, just like you smoked a bag of illy
You need a coat just to protect your throat
Two pairs of socks, kid I'm cold like ice rocks
Chap-lipped duds can't fuck wit the chatterbox
Cherry heads felt the draft of the ox
Shaolin niggas won't fuck wit one block *pause*
Broke forgot about half the slang murderer
Down wit the union big street sling murderer
Terrorizin, move I'm tranquelizin
Fast getaway wit the slow speed drivin
Two miles an hour, Cappa do it wit the power
Somebody blow something, cut fool in the tower[Cappadonna]
Yo! It's the burial ground sound, Dunn!
It's real out here
Staten Island puttin chills in y'all niggas
Forever in it.. yo

My devastatin hot '97 Mentality
Keep me on point for my four-digit salary
Heavyweight lyric never lost one calorie
I'm soon to be seen, on the TV screen
Gambino Cappacino to the Afro Sheen
Stay black, where I'm at, high road to rap council
Splash love to Wu in a orderly tonsil
Never limit to the diction, cause chaos to mixin
Brutalize a sound check, ripple through the intermission
Rap's under siege, held tight like a squeeze
Forced in the world 'Donna nuclear freeze
Doing damage to the wannabe Flip Mode and Def Squad
Ruckus a whirlpool in the rap entourage
If you dare to test thirty-six, chambers of strangers
My word of mouth it's all real wigs might peel
Livin large and in charge branch out Bon Voyage
Twenty-four diamond government named God
Alias Daryl Hill bring thugs back to kill
Circle around my son, Daryl Jr. never eatin lard
Auntie Dauntie sixteen holdin me down
AIDS of rap music may be contagious to sound
Verbal the slang pushed back to create pronoun
Method forcin J-Love to Bring the Pain from underground
Realizin food for thought is self-compromising
Shaolin cut the crack into a triple-O sizin
Blue do what he do to keep that currency risin
Hopin I catch a deal so we can catch a full wheel
Instead of catchin bodies, niggas not keepin it real
Dirtball niggas that steal cake from stores
That's my type of niggas I be wantin on my tours
Can't help it, my styles stay fat like Roseanne
Ruckus in the square I stay rough like the Clan
Panther on my arm, pen and pad in my hand
Punk motherfuckers better beware of the Shaolin
Defy interactive project Children of the Corn
Gats and my man keep em bustin till he's gone
Style so ancient it sparks just like the unicorn
'Donna come through everyday my uniform
Changes and switches, I came to make ladies out of bitches
Crackhead niggas get stitches
So what up with that kid, danger when I attack kid
Watch how the slang hits you, just like a bat kid
Form another pyramid, look how we slid
All over Park Hill, Stapleton politic
On a twenty dollar bill all in it together
You can't fuck with the stormy weather, yaknahmean?

[Ghostface]

Wake up... wake up
Wake up...

[Verse 1: Method Man]
Wake up, get a hold of your life, go get your cake up
The motto in the streets is you eat, or you get ate up
Straight up, you tired of waiting, go get your weight up
My peoples tired of waiting for reparations to pay us
Screaming Jesus can save us, I, I get the Bentley if I save up
But that's just another trick to enslave us
Push the minimum wages
Put, put our fathers up in them cages
Then watch out when mother struggled to raise us
But, but my ambition won't let me live in this poor condition
That doesn't care about color, creed, or your religion
Priests, politicians gotta listen to opposition
From my position, we still ain't got a pot to piss in
From my position, we still ain't got a pot to piss in

[Verse 2: Masta Killa]
Allah said to save the babies from the cold
Pour wisdom in the cup so the truth overflows
Still, knowledge is that bread that keeps us well-fed
Old time religion will not bring us satisfaction
Without action now who can disagree with me?
God is not a mystery, there's nowhere in history
That you could show and prove to me
But still you face east and nod your head to me religiously
I'm G-O-D, to infinity, for real

[Hook: sample]
The world won't get no better
If we just let it be
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it yeah, just you and me

[Verse 3: Cappadonna]
Poor reparations, the Bush administration
Unequality, martial law, segregation
False hood, false teaching, false education
Now's the time for us to come amongst this nation
They deceiving us, they don't believe in us
They believe in that Cream like Julius Caesar
I'm like Marcus Garvey, Malcolm X with the heaters
Ripping the chains of the remains of all of the leaders
Never worship the image of evil swine eaters
I'm on the back of the bus with two fine divas
We in the jungle of life, but never jungle fever
I'm God-body all day long, spiritual life lessons
That I recite in this song
Trying to wake up everybody, can't we all get along?
For all my people that's out there persevering through the storm
Black fist, Staten Island, stand up, stand strong
Penetrate through the gate and bring the Clan along

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Raekwon]
Wake up and realise the times
That we living in the world is getting more iller than ever
Thought we was chillin', striving change for the better
But it was a dream like Martin Luther
He had a vision that could move a mountain
Protect one another, that's world to my brother Malcolm
As-salamu alaykum, alaykum as-salam
We want justice, police supposed to protect and serve
And then they shoot us down like wild animals
The nerve of them cold-hearted killers
With blue suits slaying our black youth
The earth cries from all the blood that's being spilled
We need a solution fast, get InshAllah bill
Let me educate them, translate it meaning God's will
It goes all in together, together how we are
To stand with a plan, provided we down to fall
And that's the Willie Lynch tactics that separated the masses
Taught us all to think backwards

[Reversed sample: RZA]

[Hook]

We gonna change the world (x5)[Verse 1: RZA]
Aiyo, slipperly slurp slip, nigga, churped off, two sniffs of cocaine
This motherfucker broke the glass in my whip
Try'nna dip, on this twenty dollar bill I had on my dashboard
And police is asking me son, why I whoop his ass for
Save y'all two hours of paperwork, my neighbor lurk
Watchdog, chew ass out, son, and put in major work
We collect antique ammunitions, and plus
We got them big guns, you only see in science fictions
My Uncle Cuffie's the chief, but my little, knucklehead
Cousin Mar', yeah, son, is a thief
And we gave him a job, making three hundred a week
But he slipped on my piece, now he's back in the streets

[Hook: The Mars Volta]
How many times have you let your tongue go slip
From the grin in your teeth and the cracks of your lips
I never heard such nerve before
But you better spill slowly through the cracks of my pores
Just to please you honey, just to please you honey
And how many times have you let your tongue go slip
From the grin in your teeth and the cracks of your lips

[Verse 2: A.G.]
A.G. is King like Tutankhamen or Haile Selassie
Body the party, watchin' for niggas tryin' to Pac me
Or Biggie Smalls me, come on, please
With these gemstars, I'm Jason Vorhees
A's loose, so much pain inflicted, remain addicted
Carry microphones, with the Passion of Je-sus
It's Flamboyant for life, nigga, throw those L's up
Ain't millionaires, by this year, then catch us in 12 months
Now who's fuckin' with Andre?
A beast on the east, love on the west, ask Kanye
Still Diggin' motherfucker, it's that plain and simple
G.D. til' my heart beat,discontinue
On the ave., til every soul in the ghetto is gone
Where niggas sell more rock than heavy metal songs
Anything you want to know, then read E2K
Fuck with A, and get broke up like B2K, cuz..

[Hook]

[Verse 3: RZA]
Aiyo, aiyo, cuz I'm the piece, the magnetic, I'm not the weak and pathetic
Sometimes, inside my rhymes, you hear words that perfected
Master your Hung Gar, five animal form kung fu
Thundar the Barbarian sword, being swung
Wu-Tang, invincible blade, thrust to parry
Up the Temple steps, much water got carried
In this industrious world, meet the illustrious
Uncombustional, give props like Doctor Huxtable
Knew many men, only trust a few
Women, love the few, mention Wu-Wear linen, rugged blue
God-U's, I tuck a few, known to smash out a club or two
And represent the worldwide W

[Hook]

[The Mars Volta]
Oh, oh, your veins, may call, in sweat, for blood
Your veins, may call, in sweat, for blood
Your veins, may call, in sweat, for blood
Feed you the flesh of men, so you can see end again
Yeah, yeah..."I wanna stay with you, forever"

[Verse 1]
Yo, yo, the A-1 sauce, the Divine Force
My mind blind force is known to blow time off course
Even, if I rode around the world on a blind horse
Strapped down, I'd still get my point across
Allah is father of all
You debate whether big, whether small
Whether short, whether tall
Whether dense, whether length
Whether strength, whether width
Either man, animal, bird or fish
Whether, black or white, more shapes than snowflakes
Existin', everywhere but you still can't locate
The man of steel couldn't bend me
Time couldn't end me
Even the great devil Satan that tried to befriend me
Understand the equality, God in a bodily form
Lettin' my knowledge be born
Lettin' my knowledge be born

"I wanna stay with you, forever"

[Verse 2]
Yo, yo, yo
I be the fatal flyin', I'm like NATO flyin'
Over your country and droppin' down forty tons of iron
Filled with explosives, your chance is hopeless
We have your head poppin' up like the blowfish
I'm not talkin' Hootie, nigga pass the zootie
I could bag the cootie, maybe smoke the ootie
The runaway train with no track
I got the heart of Faye Dunaway whippin' that child with the coatrack
T.V. droppin' bombs or droppin' germs
Baby moms in the courthouse, she's droppin' terms
Guns go off, bustin' all directions
D.J. choose, another fuckin' dope selection

"With you forever"
"Like the corners of my mind"
"I wanna stay with you, forever"

[Verse 3]
Yo, the pen is mightier than the sword, as I face my worldly challenge
In the scale of justice and my heart remains balanced and neutral
My respect for all men is mutual
As my thoughts surpass a level to which you devils compute to
You've been given the chance to hear the true and living
So do the knowledge, son, before you do the wisdom
So you can understand, how the thunder and
Lighting above your head is caused by the Son of Man
We experimentin' with high explosions
That cause the place to quake and the surface erosions
The earth produce lava like the mouth produce saliva
This wisdom goes deeper than your scuba diver
In search for the pearl jewels sold to Tiffany
My verbal heart symphony will strike the epiphany
Insight, ignite, and then men might, see love and hell
Hell and right, then excel, to be masters of your circumference
First, by obtainin' mastery of your common sense
This supreme wisdom clears a man's vision
You can see it through the lies and the phantasm
Of the equivocal, two-faced political individual
Who's only out for residual, fabricatin' lies
To eradicate the wise
But we come to civilize and gravitate to the skies
Of the heavenly celestial sphere
Trust me, son, it's dear, in between your ears

[Hook: RZA]
A day to God is a thousand years
Men walk around with a thousand fears
The true joy of love bring a thousand tears
In the world of desire, there's a thousand snares

"I wanna stay with you forever"{*kids chanting in foreign tongue*}

[Intro: RZA]
(Attention!) Yeah, yeah..a special guest appearance
From the slums.... (Attention!) yo, aiyo

[RZA]
I examine your diameter, third eye light the camera up
Be careful, I got four ninjas, inside your parameter
Perimeter, flame burst out all sides like Gamera
My poisonous is released, gas from the canister
Raise the black fist, we keep the earth on it's axis
I make a good day move slow like molasses
Welcome to the bee hive, dual processor with the G5
There's not a tape or disco break I can't revive
In this high tech world of fire wire and microchip
We still keep the four-five clip, filled with the spiral tip

[GZA]
I come from the 36 Chambers of danger
With many lyrical swordsmen, that quick to change ya
The difficulty to see closely, is mostly
It's a critical point, when ya rap niggas approach me
Like the blind, death, dumb, who mind was left numb
A non B-Boy nigga, couldn't rhyme to the drum
When I started M.C.'ing I entered, the gates of pleasure
Not knowing, I be coming with, too much to measure
With the math of an elder, and the steel of a welder
The path of tray, that I had laid down, and held a
Blueprint, that would draw attention like the Pope
I examine all with the internal mirror of the scope

{*Sen Dog speaking in Spanish*}

[RZA]
Supreme deluxe edition, CREAM with a touch of wisdom
Beams that through up the system, spleens, I conduct, you listen
How you gonna tell me no, yo, the fuck you is in
Locked in a four block radius like a public prison
Twenty two year old, dunn, ain't got a cup to piss in
But he got a barrel gun, and that's knuckle twitching
And he got a baby moms and a cousin bitching
Went to catch a body, now he stuck in another prison

[Raekwon]
When you see it, you better acknowledge, your all swords
Blaze the green hundred fours
Pull out on you, blew you for the cause
And Sudan outst a nigga, seclude you from my Clan
This is water Glock, aces on cameras sniffin' raw
Why try to fuck with these lecturers
I'm so high powered, my electrical structure blew down the floor
You was king for a second, I reigned, came with a different name
The W.T.C. Family and more, one!

{*Sen Dog speaking in Spanish again*}

[GZA]
They applause when I make my entrance
I move on 'em with age and experience, before I start the sentence
The rhyme was designed to meet most demand
Is enough to compensate, fertilize the land
He blew out the belt drive, M.C.'s they felt vibes
Powerful dart, narrowly missing your whole tribe
Scientists look, at the magnitude and devastation
But the strands of heavy metal seem to have no relation
But it's always potential for large scale disasters
Because the instrumentals, spins a hundred times faster
Many was taken, is at the price of a pawn
And the collective lost had left, thousand of mourn
Them Clansmen, are the nucleus of hip-hop
There's no room for error, M.C.'s will get dropped
Evidence of terrifying threats from heat pressure
Power by strong winds that blew rhymes off the dresser
The words spread through the town from Yonkers to Leffers
And to kill off the slang was a city wide effort
But they couldn't be more wrong, my click was all strong
Fit together seamlessly, til you're all gone

{*Sen Dog speaking in Spanish again w/ "Attention!" several times*}

[Outro: chess sample]
The queen by far, is the strongest piece
Should too, should not be prematurely brought
Into play, during in the opening
Or she will be attacked by wicked pieces
And driven back, it is very dangerous
To make a raid with the queen early on in the game
It is best, in opening, to make but one move with the queen
And that, to a square where she is not exposed
To any direct or indirect attack[RZA]
A man with no friends, only live for revenge
Live his life off the henge, cut, through a thousand men
Blade swing with the force of a cyclone
Cut crystal and bone, pistol and chrome
Stand in my path, you're a dead man
I cut the whole world in half for the Number One headband

Word up, big dick, motherfucking house
Whaddup, bench press these cats, yo

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, god show these niggas how we get deep, down, and dirty
Like Keyon, got his wig pushed back, five-thirty
Yo they gotta hit placed on my head, what should the god do?
Max out in Spain and do business with the Jews
Never that, don't ever look at me out of synch
The imperial, industrial king got weight
Don't give a fuck, like the poor part we watch Hart To Hart
They used to push me in shopping carts, now I'm writing darts
Like Ebinezzer, the porno teaser
Saying words like sheeba, ____ rapper valet the visa
My team got rocks like Six Flags, plus the Wu lab
Cameras in nine bedrooms we own DATs
Don't touch this crackling hot shit
I snap ya shoulder blade in half, laugh and pop shit
Reader's Digest passed my book to L. Ron Hubbard
It got back that the world government tried to dub it
But devils love it, booby-trap raps cover the track like a-deck
Sharper than cuts laced on Marley
Scratched supreme clientel, my cartel
Willie Stargel passed this shit his piece, where's the Nobel?
Oh well, signing off as usual
The arsonist leaving niggas lost in the stairwell

[Break: Ghostface Killah (The Delphonics)]

You represent that project Murder West Brighton Now Born
Arm banging into that will (ahhhhh), word up
(After the smoke is clear)
Yeah, what, Stapleton
(Delphonics and Wu-Tang still here)
Park Hill, word up, yeah, yeah, New York

[Raekwon]
The greatest story ever told by me, precisely
Roman numeral IV plus three describe me
My son move like the toad, get drunk, speak in codes
Throw a fiend in the sleeper hold, got beef with the cloak
Met my comrade, go half on this lamp down in Baghdad
Flipping like a meth's tab, get money like an Arab
The tight niggas snapped, six legs on the crab
Now hush, you wanna do what? My click better bust

[RZA]
Underprivileged, grew up in a Stapleton house village
Where blood flood the water in streets like oil spillage
My front door was open and then man spotted 55 boas
Niggas was still flowing, voice was echoing
I rise high like an octave
The proctor wouldn't gamble the sample, it shocked her
My ninjas run round like Shaka Zulu, some play peace like Donny the Guru
Others live to be wise and old like Desmond Tutu
Undisputed champion belt holders, shaped and mould us
Soul controller of the lunar, solar and the polar
I blow hash smoke through my nasal, my brain with ________
Wu-Tang whole battalion was like cannibal weight in Brazilians

[Outro: The Delphonics]
After the smoke is done
Wu-Tang/Delphonics number one
After the smoke is done
Wu-Tang/Delphonics number one
After the smoke is clear
Delphonics and Wu-Tang still here
After the smoke is done
Wu-Tang/Delphonics number one
Ahhhhh (Wuuuuuu, wuuuuuu)We interrupt your program to bring you
*alot of static*

This is a Wu-Tang Killa Bee exclusive blast
*echoing*

Wake up, wake up, wake up

Wu-tang, Wu-Tang
Wu-tang, Wu-Tang
Wu-tang, Wu-Tang....

Verse 1: Bobby Digital

Bobby Steels, Staple' tales
MCs get your lips stapled
Project Killa Hill
Is stamped on the map like the compass
Sacred sword play tongue-twist piercing holes in you
You can't escape seventy-thousand kilowatts
Blast in your box walk wid alarm clocks
Cars drive explodes on the block
One stop parks, pops in trunk
Snares pop loud as Glock shots
Pierced like a earring in your face, cops stop, give a sitation
Report for radio station identification
*Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up*
Love IQ got you drunk, you depressed of Wu
Flying monks fatal darts from your airwaves strike you antenna
You feeled a bit shimmer
It makes your like you dimmer
You thought you turned your dial from this
You best to slit your wrists
Feel the soul of your heart like Don Cornelius
Unfamiliar, leave no trace like Simon Templer
Rhyme emperor, styles switch daily like temperature
In your atmosphere the rap racketeer
Six pack battery back keep em stacked
I live for hip-hop
And tall brown skin sugar plum who love the lollipos
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang
