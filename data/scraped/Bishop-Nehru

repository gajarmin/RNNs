[Sampled Intro: 2Pac]
I would tell each and every person out there
Doh-Forget about that click n up Sh-thing, you know what I mean?
Be to yourself, stay to yourself, trust nobody
TRUST NO-BODY
After dark, you know what I mean?
Straight up, my closest friends did me in
My closest friends, my homies, people who I done took care of they whole family
I done took care of everything for em, looked out for them, put em in the game
Everything! Turned on me!
Fear is stronger than love, remember that
Fear is stronger than love, all the love I gave, didn't mean nothing when it came to fear
So it's all good, but I'm a soldier, I always survive, I constantly come back
Ya know what I mean? Only thing that can kill me, is death, that's the only thing that will ever stop me, is death
And even then my music live forever

[Verse 1: Bishop Nehru]
Check!
I'm a genius when it comes to spittin' flows
My sixteens hard, don't act as if you didn't know
I'm laying low, not in a circle
But blowing O's and hoping that Buddha knows
That there's plenty of foes with four fours
Tryna get a nigga clipped quick!
It sick shit going on, but I try to stay calm, and focus on songs
Because ones that's doing wrong, tryna have me tag along
And word is bond, I rather bomb word vapor from bongs
That's word with no friends
No games when I hold pens, and these hoes, they hoping
That my heart, will open, and let em into the cash
But my mind sets lab
Like they did when I was in class, just struggling to pass
But at last I past them, with the stash and my live 10
You boyfriend ask him, he know that there's crack in my
Tracks when I rap, people clap and react fast
Because they know that Nehru and this rap shit is gonna last
It's the fact that I'm everything that you lack, nigga you whack
Don't act like I ain't murder these rappers with one track
The lights leak, the bright peak, start of the show
Now I got you, and your ho front row at my show, whoa!

[Bridge]
Now I got you, and your ho front row at my show, whoa!
You and your ho front row at my show, whoa! (whoa)
Now I got you, and your ho front row at my show, whoa!

[Verse 2: Bishop Nehru]
But shit slow, cause there's no entry
For ones that tryna tempt me
With ounces of sticky, and icky bitches that's tryna get me
Hit with a charge, cause the kid live large
In the stars is where I rest, and my bars they be the best
And I bust it out my chest
And clowns, I never stress
They seeing, they could progress
So they tryna get with the cheques
Hah! Fickle Mind$ tryna blind a nigga shine
My grind, never combine with people that's on the side
Because all of them living lies, and I be living these lines
Like lives, below foes, there's always a no-soul
Don't go "Oh No", when you notice the kid is global
When your ho's backstage giving me a slow blow
I know I spit advance right? That's why my advance right
I'm killing any rapper that stand with a pen and mic

[Outro]
Stay outta sight, and I'm tryna be polite
But I swear when a nigga write from the pen acetyl ignite
It's like(x3)[Intro]
Emperor Bish'

[Verse 1]
Melancholy days got me held in a spotty faze
Delving in my body trying to be common anomalies
Praised honestly dazed and toppled and in amaze
But gotta be amazing, it need commas in my banking
Been slaving since 7th grade trying to get a page over wages I paid
And be majorly played with my name paved on the great LA shape
Hoping the name sticks like tape
Straight apex from an ape aerate chasing and then escape
To a great fantasia hotter than a blazer on a day in Jamaica
I spit sick flava equate into the equator so savor how I shape ya

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel that y'all wanna use me
Wish to abuse me and mentally confuse me
It's usually the truth seen
So it seems routine
Nothing new that I'm seeing
Users human beings
I swear that I can't get used to the users
Swear that I can't get used to the users
I swear that I can't get used to the users
Used to the users
Used to the users

[Verse 2]
I've been thinking too much so its hard for me to see
The direct path of light and what I'm suppose to be
There's mad people watching, in the family I'm the option
Want the Grammys and the Oscars, and I'm swearing I can conquer
But lately I've been locked up and since I'm seeing green like Blanka
Everybody wants to chill and wants to pop up, but I just want to make music and influence
I hate expectations they ruin every single thing that I think of doing
Could you please just leave me to be human
Fuck what you expect or think is correct
Don't interject, just gimme a second while rejections exit

[Chorus][Produced By IfeFinch ]

[Verse 1 : Astro]
Niggas niggas niggas, its time to listen up
Take off your rented leather
Put down your white cups
Hop out your lambos
Take off them fake chains
We on TV like we ain't got no brain
See modern day hip hop?
Is coons and thick thots
That club tempo records got us moving like robots
Turn up turn up
Hit a nigga with a burna
If it don’t involve cash
Then it really don’t concern us
We diss dark skin women for anything whiter
Solange at hove we mad cos he diddn’t fight her
Some niggas only talk proper when they ‘bout to fight ya
And we got pimps that’s known like Mona Scott
Find hoes give ‘em TV shows collect O’s
Slow the moolie down get the moolah faster
Nigga was the first slave and the first master


[Hook]

Damn…
I feel bad for my nigga
Try to change, get no help from half of my niggas
Sometimes I gotta sit back and laugh at my nigga
Like ‘haha-haha-haha-ha-ha-ha-haaa
Damn…
I feel bad for my nigga
Some niggas exploit to get cash from my nigga
Sometimes I gotta sit back and laugh at my nigga
Like ‘haha-haha-haha-ha-ha-ha-haaa

Verse 2 : [Bishop Nehru]
Stro told you we were the first slave and the first master
We were only the slave, cos the melanin that we have
Can protect us from the wrath of the sun, no pun
We don't need for shade or UV sprays
Just to protect from the rays that the beamer feed us
Since a fetus its been, key to us
So that's reason for keeping us, out late
While its blazing, while they in the shade
They awaiting' the payment
Soon to be weighed in and traded
Its crazy
Cos now we've been trained into trading ourselves
And sell for cell phones and wealth no health in pocket
(But I got the new I phone 6, dude its sick it takes way greater flicks)
But your, grammar is shit
(Dam, stop hatin' bish!, Bishop the Bish, son always complainin')
Nah, i'm just tryin' save all our slaves again

[Hook]

[Verse 3 : Astro]
Yo, Niggeros!
How you figure those figure rolls set you free?
You run the corner till your man said 'excuse me'
I gotta build some shit
We gotta steal some shit
Or kill just to feel legit
Its only fourteen percent of us or maybe even less
The police check us, put a bullet in your chest
Life's a board game and we always losers
Nuts, how blacks always spend their cash on shoes
Shawtys posing bow legged in pictures
Callin' their best friends bitches
Niggas dress like they got riches
Its ridiculous
How they ridicule us in every way
Dont get a dollar off the luxury for what you pay
Every day bodies drop
Niggas wanna hashtag
Brainwash, shower cap
Niggas wanna flashgrab
Its a shame, cos Niggas hear everything i'm sayin'
But still, nothings gonna change

...Niggas[Intro]
Young blood, he's smart and he's tough
But he's got a lot to learn about survival
And the man he's gonna learn from is...
Doom!

[Verse 1: MF DOOM]
Uh, lay in the cut like a puma on the prowl
The right time to get 'em is now, clow
That's the end of that, beginning of a never-ending saga
Of how he gets it in like Kamagra
Cheers here's a lager, yours is O'Doul’s
These are from the untold rules of the old school
It’s like a woolah what it do to one’s medulla oblongata
Revenge of Montezuma on a blotter
(Yo, this track's off the rack DOOM)
It's that clack clack boom
Like what's contained in a square centimeter of the vacuum
When lava rock cool who play the block fool
Villain get paid laid back like chacmool
Enough to make Pac drool wherever he at
Invest wealth, impress self check ace stat
Damn mask gets stickier than crack sweat
In the corner pocket that's gained some aspect
(Casket) and yet still blow like gasket
Many ass out, no clout, no smash hit
And that's it, plan B, let the tools spark
Plan A's a shoe-in, straight shootin' like a pool shark
Rack 'em up, just don't quit your old job
Small trolls whose type slob on poll blog
You know you done fucked up now, like O-Dog the menace
It's all love, play tennis
The mic is the shotty, forget about the flack vest
They hustle is backwards, whack -- it's tactless
That don't count, chickens before they hatch in the basket
Body beats, closed casket

Bishop!

[Verse 2: Bishop Nehru]
I'm moving with the all black tactic
Black kicks, black jeans, black jacket matchin'
I'm pulling 21s like I'm using black magic
And they thinking that I am because the quality's fantastic
They told me I should focus on scholastics
And others told me focus on elastic
I'm using both of those as a tactic
As I mix it with my passion for the rappin'
To think I could have been trappin'
I'm happy I wasn't trapped in
The loop de loop and shootin'
I'm moving through the mind pollution, tryna find solution
But I'm only closer to dilution
The illusions are leading me to delusion
I'm sick of being confused and I don't have much of a fuse
So I lack getting amused, feeling actively abused
More days of the blues, I'm waiting on the clues
Alone as I cruise through life and all its waters
Must have hit some ice-bergs because its feeling like torture
It's H-O-R-S-E, I'm Jordan, in '96
I'm sinking everything man, still I'm playing for the chips
So basically, I'm saying I'm sinking my own ship
You can think what you want cause your thoughts ain't important
I'm feeling blanker than a CD ROM
And all I ever wanted was for them to see these rhymes
They telling me be patient, I ain't got the time
Cause I'm seeing trash rappers getting over night shine
While I'm still behind, and they ask why I whine
Is it because I'm living off the thoughts in my mind
Or is it I'm just living because nobody is complying
I see that I'm inspiring the moves of these sirens
But how could I be vibrant?
Only thing I'm close to is violence
So hurry up and cue all the violins
Looking from a vile lens
Ever since the girl I was eyeing for prom
Ain't wanna tag along, it's something that I long
But I understand the order though
Life's like a big playbook full of audibles
You never know the working play until you go toss a few
Packing rappers in caskets your boy Nehru

[Outro]
So the first thing you’re gonna have to do
If you decide that you’re going to be
Someone who thrives in times of hardship
And there are always those who thrive in times of hardship, aren’t there?
There are those who survive epidemics
There are those who thrive in hard times
In other words, we want you to step back far enough
You know how when you’re in your airplane
And you’re looking across the landscape
High in the sky, 500 miles an hour, 50 thousand feet in the sky
And you look down, and it all looks pretty calm
Down there, doesn’t it
Put it on the ground at that speed, not so calm
We’re encouraging you to take flight
We’re encouraging you to ba- ba- back up from it
Get a longer view and understand it
It is not possible for things to get worse in a universe that is expanding
But, this is something that you may begin to notice
As contrast exists, and it always will
And as everything is expanding, including contrast
As contrast becomes more, then asking becomes more
And when asking becomes more, and resistance stays strong
Then more people beat themselves up by not going with the flow
That’s all you’re seeing right now
But when you, as an individual, who can’t control what the others do
Let loose of your own resistance and go with the flow
Then you become one who experiences immediate thriving
Now this is the part about something you’re going to have to learn to do during this interim
It’s just a few months
You have to decide that you don’t care what others think of youNehru, Nehru

When somebody waits for me

[HOOK]
Every time I try to be
There's somebody who waits for me
[Wanting energy to thieve]?
But they don't think I'll ever see
I don't want no enemies
But I won't be portrayed as weak
That's why I see differently
And sometimes I don't even speak

[Verse 1]
It's honestly astonishing the way I've got them piling in
Autopilot rhyming, still I find [a strike]? I lie within
Just because I'm smiling doesn't mean inside I ain't dying
And hiding but sympathizing, I've tried minimizing
Cos that's when guys switch sides, and wanna empathize and
[I take pride in write ?]
In this life
Advance the place and hands it feels right
Left the tight hold the spite
Cos they want to see me leaning like [pints and a sprite?]
I'm seen like Pisa but the geezers taught me Giza is key
Then I dug deep, dig dug in mummies
Manifest the jewels straight from the tummy
To beat the beast leaving us bloody
Bluffing and tussling for money
Stunting us to be dummies
I know they know I know so that's why I think
They waiting for me
So I gots to worry

[HOOK]

[Verse 2]
Have you ever felt inside a giant eye that's watching
So confined in that hiding's your only option
Like a lighthouse that's spotting
And people that seeking
This light is reason's lead you to think of leaving
So many demons you keep on feeding
That even with the least control seems to be weak and
Draining like leeches every weekend 'til the weekend ends
Even weekends are leaving me uneven
The odd seven repeating
Life lessons were peeping
In the second and dissecting it
So second miss is dissection different
I strive for magnificent
By consistently spitting significant
But often ignorance leaves them disinterested
You the hottest out I'm about to leave you extinguished then
I've been instinctively thinking of extincting them
Hoping in a blink but it seems
Like it's longer than I think

[HOOK]x2[Chorus]
I been out my mind, feeling feeble
Why am I the guy seen as evil?
Time is flying by like an eagle
I'm tryna survive and be peaceful

[Verse 1]
It seems problems are always approaching
Been living pessimistic and it's gotten me frozen
The slow-motion life that I've been provoking
Is not for the coaching
Just coasting and I know this
But I'm thinking it's bogus
Probably cause it's I see me speeding in a green lotus
And then I wake from the dream, sleeping on the sofa
I been queasy on this life coastal
But I feel I should approach with hoes before I throw up
Cause I ain't going to these parties, they fucking suck
At every one someone's trying to get me drunk
Yo, bruh, you sure you don't wanna try a cup
Nah
Honestly, I need Marleys to puff
And a pear-shaped queen with an ass I could cup
Cause the chick that I went on Sway to discuss
Told me she sees me as friends and that ain't much

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Uh, I lost my mom needed dad or a tide
And I just can't find it
It's awfully silent
Plus I have a hard time deciding
What I want to do with life
I like to meditate big beats and write
But these parasites are repairing my sight
Tryna siphon light and that's the shit I never like
So like Pike, I continue my hike
Out of sight, on the low, though my eyes tight closed
And the Tommy got a oddly cologne
Probably cause I'll be home on the roof getting blown
Cops still patrol just to make themselves known
But I go unnoticed like a ghost in the midst
And its ghost in the midst
So I stroll to the fifth dimension
And they mentioned dementia
But I dismissed insults they send to me
And continue killing with these soliloquies
Peace

[Chorus] (x2)[Hook - Bishop Nehru]
To me you mean the most baby
You already know (yeah, you already know)
To me you mean the most baby
You know like I know (know like I know)
You already know
That to me you mean the most, baby
You already know
That to me you mean the most, baby

[Verse 1 - Bishop Nehru]
Listen close so you know how it's supposed to be
It's no joke to me, I care soulfully
For you and I know you feel the same too
Cause you always smirking when you say it ain't true
You're an angel in my eyes, though that's no surprise
There's loads of guys that got the same thing in mind
Just know that I'm different from the dudes that you've seen
See I'm young and a teen but I still think of bein'
With a being in your caliber, you hold your own down
My queen with gold crown, you're leaving the whole town
Astounded, getting hounded, but still you're staying grounded
Aight, who am I kidding, you get cocky every now and then

[Bridge - Bishop Nehru]
I'm just playing, I'm just being a tease
But for real girl I will satisfy your needs
You're who I'm trying to please, indeed
Just follow me
I think I should show you how much you really mean to me

[Hook - Bishop Nehru]

[Verse 2 - Bishop Nehru]
Seeing you smile starts to warm my heart
I think about you constantly, I hate when we apart
I love to sit and admire like a work of art
You're beautiful, smart, and your style is off the chart
Just know you spark a flame inside, I blame them eyes
You're fine, even wine whines when you come by
I try to show compassion, I know that's all you're lackin'
You're who I'm baggin' till my back end's in the grass and
Six deep, know that I sleep and see you there
"I need you" is rare but maybe that's what you need to hear
Cause I see you near in my future, and if that's clear
You could be my cougar, I'm hoping you don't lead to Krueger

[Bridge + Hook - Bishop Nehru][Verse 1]
My flows amazing, dig holes in graves
Hold shit, hold their savings, get lost I'm paving
A line of success, through my mind and chest
My rhymes impressed, now niggas tryna hide they vest
But it's fine, I don't mind, niggas rhymes are swine
They lines behind, everyday is rise and grind
No constant shine, my essence is the wildest pond
Your sound define weakness, they crowding mine
I'm bound to shine so fall back, you niggas ain't all that
Get sketchy and get messy, niggas dusting the wrong cat
I'm flowing past, any other MC alive, niggas hope to survive
Cutting throats with these lines, no lie bruh, you niggas is tired
Tryna find ya way to [?] your rap lines expired
I blow by ya, rap actors tryna catch us
Bishop the master, my rhymes be hotter than magma

[Hook]
I kill ya whole team with a 16(x7)
And I'm spitting my shit I cause big scenes

[Verse 2]
I was the type of nigga who write about lighting triggers
But then, I realized those lines were real lies
I killed time, still trying to get a little buzz
Cause I knew who I was, but in school nobody fucked with a nigga
I was lame, still lame and for fame
But in my brain I was thinking of dames
And all of the ways, that imma change the game leaving flames to my name
I'm praying, that next year I'm the one critics acclaim
While claims from fake MC's that's chasing me I sit in glee
Cause nobody passing these 16's
Until we get seen on scenes or your TV screen
We gon be, keen and supreme while repeating routines
And chasing dreams, cause the best, what I'm planning to be
I'm damaging beats, selling seats, and leaving my feet
Above the planet, dropping lines as hard as granite
And damage the fans demanded now niggas can't even manage
I planned this, muhfucker

[Hook]Welcome, welcome, welcome to you all
To this luxurious project
Strictly flows!
We got some of the best producers from around the lands
Some of the illest flows you ever hear in your life
I am your host, the 16 years old' phenom
I hope you all enjoy-joy, joy
Yourself this evening, night, morning!
You know, sit along, sit with peers, parents
Let a couple doobies roll
Do you, but most of all, enjoy the week?
Shout out to, to, to

Shout out to, shout out to, to, to
Show south to'
' and their tools by the way!
Yeah, yeah pretty fucking retarded, you know what I mean?
Real shit! Shout out to anybody listening that '
I appreciate your talent, all that, you know what I mean?
Suburban show guns coming at you
That's' entertainment
It's not what this is called, man
That's what we are, do you follow me?
Oh, everybody out here hating me
Doubting me so I could do this shit
That, the thought that
You know, I wouldn't be a success as I am right now!
Just the beginning, so stay tuned!
All my new roomies out there, stay up!
' love all ya! Peace![Intro]
PROGRESSION ONLY
Mr. Franky on the beat know I never see defeat
So just bow down to my feet while I'm watching nigga eat

[Verse 1]
Dreams of living lavish life
But still trapped in the savage life
I grab the pad and mic, with all thoughts of grabbing massive light
My thoughts and past they fight, with each other
Since the brother, never stutter when I speak
You be lucky to hear me mutter
This butter flow is to go and show the rookies
Just how to do this shit bars harder than stale cookie
I got my mind for niggas and they down for getting pushy
Cause the cat don't got my tongue like I'm afraid of eating pussy
So don't overlook me, niggas I know I got potential to blow
And when I do I guarantee my bottom bitch is your ho
And niggas claiming they Christ and got the deadliest flows
But really, they like Judas and they written's is froze
I mean y'all looking to pose, and I'm looking for foes
Who got, riches and hoes, so I, can scatter they bones
I hear moans cause the gift that I behold
Feeling bold, cause my goals got me making gold
And breakin these roads after shows

[Outro]
See, I told y'all niggas nothing special know what I mean?
Just the track, show a little progression
Nothing serious, I'm sure niggas are still gonna hit me up on Twitter
On some bullshit, saying I fell off and shit
It's whatever, Emperor Nehru bout to be the hardest shit[Verse 1: Bishop Nehru]
They can hold these testicles, if they test these goals
Just know they ain't messing with our senses flow
As you know if niggers ain't learned they lesson
We ain't stressing if it's less than dough
Me and my bro we'll be killing this shit
As good as it gets we flip cards
Skipping these guest we deliver them shits
Niggers need hits it's fine you just give'em this shit
Trying to get you loose niggers losing in a grouse world
But they still lose if they still losing
They control never coming know that
That's why we start this straight lap
Why we hunt [?]we loved it
We killed them in public, we interrupt public
Hold up like they long heads
More crushing so make the assumption Bishop
Killing all these rappers and never feeling[?]

[Hook: Bishop Nehru]
Gimme your 16 I leave'em all feeling
Got my feet 5 foot deep into the ceiling
Niggers vex trying to flex they ain't leaving
I spit for look you barely breathing
Gimme your 16 I leave'em all feeling
Got my feet 5 for deep into the ceiling
Niggers vex trying to flex they ain't leaving
I spit for look you barely breathing

[Verse 2: Bishop Nehru]
Take a listen [?]
That shit that is so twisted
That precision can't miss it
Rib stitches and constantly stack riches
Now get the stiff paraplegic twisters
Get more dough that's your rehab
Niggers nap they looking crappy
All they nag about is trapping
Steady snapping popping nixing over
And napping with the past
Rapping any rapper in that soul
And I'm spitting there is no competition
I leave the others missing and
Continue with my mission
And as you people listen you see that I'm dismissing
Any nigger that listen is flip in their position cause
[?]and don't worry about prices
Cause the{?]in the game require me to have a license
Rappers is [?]riding with violence
Buying riffs then trying to roll

[Hook][Verse]
Rappers are brewed alive, it's true, cuz I maneuver wise
They ain't buzz, they just bums wearing suits and ties
Truthfully lose the ties, we ain't equivalent
I'm sickenin' with sentences, peep how I'm kickin' it
Like Messi, overstep me, it can get messy
Got cats that be strapped the desi
Niggas won't forget me and the chicks call me sexy
The same reason niggas tryna snipe like Wesley
I'm in a ghillie suit and slidin' like Presley
They talk to my back, but they never come press me
Tryna compress the beauty that the beast hold
And have me expressin' vise versa waitin' 3 four
I see the evils like an emo, yo
And I know that's how I'm perceived by the people so
I just keep it low, blind eyes thinkin' that they know
Speakin' on my insides and they ain't even seen the dough

[Hook]
Speakin' like you know me
We ain't ever even talk
We ain't ever even talk
We ain't ever even talk
Sayin' yopie you my homie
I say buddy you can walk
I say buddy you can walk
I say buddy you can walk
Thinking that you knowin' but you really knowin' nothin'
Thinkin' that you knowin', but really you just bluffin'
Thinking that you knowin' but you really knowin' nothin'
Really knowin' nothin', really knowin' nothin', really you just bluffin'[Verse 1]
Stuck in my spirit, trying to find endearment
Nowhere near it, but I know I’m here to feel it
So I never let fear get in as a clear threat
I just make my music and use it to heal breath
Breath is the spirit, you should try breathing
I do mine with (puff) and not just on the weekends
Sometimes I feel like I’m going in the deep end
Then I’m deep in, no need to depend
Cause even the pen descends for a second
Teaching me to lead and not to be second
To my own low thoughts leveling
I just want to meddle in
Not one for being the most medaling kid
I’m sick of it and thinking big
Trying to keep the game from getting rigged
Cause my eyesight of the real is thinner than a twig
Puts the scent in the wig, all aligned with energy
From a pyramid in the grid

[Hook] x2
I hear free-spirited is always best
So I invest in rest and focus on breath
Cause breath is the spirit
Cause without it there’s death
Then the spirit just exits
And moves on separate

[Verse 2]
A cherisher of breath
Ever since an asthma attack in the past
Had me a gasping mess
Felt like I was addressing death
But fortunately I wasn’t next
And they told me hold it, inhale it, depress
I did it excessive and got high off that
Just some nerds third grade just (puff) it in the back
After recess actually, in gym too if I had to breathe then I’d leave
Dizzy in the hall trippy Albuterol all in me
Still no sips can befriend me
To get their Henny, I still ain’t have it in me
Not an enemy but I’ll leave its entry, cup empty
But they think I’m drunk off of plenty
80 A’s, D placed in this tin
And a HD screen still plays me big
The tips are believing like Biebs was singing

[Hook] x4[Intro]
Young blood, he's smart and he's tough
But he's got a lot to learn about survival
And the man he's gonna learn from is...
Doom!

[Verse 1: MF DOOM]
Uh, lay in the cut like a puma on the prowl
The right time to get 'em is now, clow
That's the end of that, beginning of a never-ending saga
Of how he gets it in like Kamagra
Cheers here's a lager, yours is O'Doul’s
These are from the untold rules of the old school
It’s like a woolah what it do to one’s medulla oblongata
Revenge of Montezuma on a blotter
(Yo, this track's off the rack DOOM)
It's that clack clack boom
Like what's contained in a square centimeter of the vacuum
When lava rock cool who play the block fool
Villain get paid laid back like chacmool
Enough to make Pac drool wherever he at
Invest wealth, impress self check ace stat
Damn mask gets stickier than crack sweat
In the corner pocket that's gained some aspect
(Casket) and yet still blow like gasket
Many ass out, no clout, no smash hit
And that's it, plan B, let the tools spark
Plan A's a shoe-in, straight shootin' like a pool shark
Rack 'em up, just don't quit your old job
Small trolls whose type slob on poll blog
You know you done fucked up now, like O-Dog the menace
It's all love, play tennis
The mic is the shotty, forget about the flack vest
They hustle is backwards, whack -- it's tactless
That don't count, chickens before they hatch in the basket
Body beats, closed casket

To think I could have been trappin'
I'm happy I wasn't trapped in
The loop de loop and shootin'
I'm moving through the mind pollution, tryna find solution
But I'm only closer to dilution
The illusions are leading me to delusion
I'm sick of being confused and I don't have much of a fuse
So I lack getting amused, feeling actively abused
More days of the blues, I'm waiting on the clues
Alone as I cruise through life and all its waters
Must have hit some ice-bergs because its feeling like torture
It's H-O-R-S-E, I'm Jordan, in '96
I'm sinking everything man, still I'm playing for the chips
So basically, I'm saying I'm sinking my own ship
You can think what you want cause your thoughts ain't important
I'm feeling blanker than a CD ROM
And all I ever wanted was for them to see these rhymes
They telling me be patient, I ain't got the time
Cause I'm seeing trash rappers getting over night shine
While I'm still behind, and they ask why I whine
Is it because I'm living off the thoughts in my mind
Or is it I'm just living because nobody is complying
I see that I'm inspiring the moves of these sirens
But how could I be vibrant?
Only thing I'm close to is violence
So hurry up and cue all the violins
Looking from a vile lens
Ever since the girl I was eyeing for prom
Ain't wanna tag along, it's something that I long
But I understand the order though
Life's like a big playbook full of audibles
You never know the working play until you go toss a few
Packing rappers in caskets your boy Nehru

[Outro]
So the first thing you’re gonna have to do
If you decide that you’re going to be
Someone who thrives in times of hardship
And there are always those who thrive in times of hardship, aren’t there?
There are those who survive epidemics
There are those who thrive in hard times
In other words, we want you to step back far enough
You know how when you’re in your airplane
And you’re looking across the landscape
High in the sky, 500 miles an hour, 50 thousand feet in the sky
And you look down, and it all looks pretty calm
Down there, doesn’t it
Put it on the ground at that speed, not so calm
We’re encouraging you to take flight
We’re encouraging you to ba- ba- back up from it
Get a longer view and understand it
It is not possible for things to get worse in a universe that is expanding
But, this is something that you may begin to notice
As contrast exists, and it always will
And as everything is expanding, including contrast
As contrast becomes more, then asking becomes more
And when asking becomes more, and resistance stays strong
Then more people beat themselves up by not going with the flow
That’s all you’re seeing right now
But when you, as an individual, who can’t control what the others do
Let loose of your own resistance and go with the flow
Then you become one who experiences immediate thriving
Now this is the part about something you’re going to have to learn to do during this interim
It’s just a few months
You have to decide that you don’t care what others think of you[Hook]
Cruel world, all I'm seeing is darkness
Cruel, cruel world, all I'm seeing is darkness
Cruel world, all I'm seeing is darkness
Cruel, cruel world, all I'm seeing is darkness
Cruel world, all I'm seeing is darkness
Cruel, cruel world, all I'm seeing is darkness

[Bridge]
How 'bout you? How 'bout you? I'm seeing things clear now, how 'bout you?
How 'bout you? How 'bout you? I'm seeing things clear now, how 'bout you?
How 'bout you? How 'bout you? I'm finally seeing things from a clear-eyed view
How 'bout you? How 'bout you? I'm seeing things clear now, how 'bout you?

[Verse 1]
This life is like a mystery, look how the world's sent to me
Today I'm in the industry, next I'm ended--history
Physically won't allow it, my mental is not a coward
Still thoughts are devoured worried 'bout if now's the hour
Getting showered in this bad news, bombings and capped schools
Need capsules for my brain's strain that's the pads route
I express this stress that infests my chest, it's best
The next step is a rope as necklace
That's suicide aside, I got pride in mind
And a pretty bright future, guess it's time to grind
My shine getting impressive, though I'm still selective
With who I let give me hard times and who I let live
This world is full of mischief, and bodies trying slick tricks
Moving thick bricks is not the only way to get rich
You gotta learn to think or you'll fail
Then there goes another statistic dead or in jail
Let's prevail

[Bridge] + [Hook]

[Verse 2]
Simply an old soul, villain 'illin' killin' with these flows
Know I can blow impose and you're gonna get disposed
Exposed those who pose, living hopeless no hope
For those jokes, still I try to hold they nose so
Sorrow won't drown him, crowds will never clown him
A lot of these laws open jaws when you're brown-skin
A cap to your chest, in your complex cause honest
Your conscious said the guy following you has lost it
Your aunt just got 20 years it ain't fair
Cause she pulled a gun out but she shot it in the air
Let's prepare for all sorts of courses life offers
Think before you walk this land of cold forces
They want us on porches, they want us to forfeit
Luckily we ignored it and still found of all this
Wonderful life and light too
I got a clear view, but how about you?

[Bridge] + [Hook][Produced by Metal Fingers]

[Verse: Bishop Nehru]
My thoughts, are like a bright symphony
I'm simply, changing everything that I begin to see
Mentally, but physically I plan to change history
With a pen, note pad and a distant dream
But distance ain't a obstacle, that's too much
I'm closer than you think to the stars, nigga look up
Seeing adolescent with impressive rhymes, chasin' dimes
Not the kind that want cash, but the ones that's inside
Of my pocket, while I pocket some of these profits
Nigga's watch it and try to stop it, but all I do is block it
Straight lock it up, my cash started risin' up
Now everybody and they best friend try to ride with us
Never had a team, just a couple friends
Too many people around will hurt you in the end
Don't pretend you niggas would never kin, you tryna step in the circle but ain't allowed to get in
I'm getting more attention than I'm wishing
A bitch ain't just a prize and did I mention, when I'm sentencing, people listening
Cause my songs go harder than crack interventions
Uh, living life like a menace
Tryna get in this game and leave with some riches
No need for bitches, but I'm down for pictures
As long as they ain't girls that got no figures
Uh, Jordan 7's on my feet
Don't ask to come chill, girl I'm busy making beats
When I was in the hall you would never even speak
Now your tryna come through every day of the week
Shits crazy, you living real shady
And don't send me text messages calling me baby
I thought you were a lady, didn't give it up daily
And only your joy, boys who didn't like mainstream
Well I do, and this is nothing new
But looks like this life fine living for you
I know that you in love, but baby that sounds through
When the size don't fit, so why would I wear the shoe?
This ain't a love song so I'mma skip bars, rip hard, grip stars then dip off
Peace![Intro]
I can't explain why, I shine and no one else shines
I think everybody shines, in different things
And a lot of things I can't do
I can't play basketball like every other black person in america
But, I can act
I know how to go to that true spot in myself cause I'm there everyday
I can be me, I can be whoever cause I'm true to me I can go to neutral easy

[Verse 1]
I used to think about my dreams when I was alone
And that was often cause nobody ever called my phone
I can be great without a ring like Karl Malone
Take the throne and maybe I won't be left at home
Second grade I was writing by the monkey bars
Who ever thought a simple dream could take me this far
I used to tell them all my thoughts, they called me bizarre
Until they saw my video on WorldStar
I'm by far, the best rapper at 15
My wrist gleam my pockets wide not filled with cream
Just a spoken words I wrote not the hoes I choke or all the guns I tote
I don't do it

[Verse 2]
I stay back and I watch everything around
I see your presence they tryna stress us to hold us down
You won't compress it, me I will express it
Freely, and if they beat me better believe my talking won't stop
I'm higher than a motherfucker walking down the block in my tank top
I promise myself I wasn't gon stop
A new house for my mom what I'm tryna cop
Bomb drops ain't for me
And I'm just waiting for my presents like it's Christmas Eve
Man just wait and see, I don't care about diamonds and expensive things
I just want a nice girl in some bright weave

[Outro x2]
Something we all adore
It's the one thing worth dying for
Nothing but pain, stuck in this game, searching for fortune and fameMe and my niggas on the block, you know the spot
Cops can watch, cause I'm not spring them mad shot
Cause it's a mission, you need to listen
In the end you just different, you see the difference
Different colors, you are brothers, we ain't equal like others
Single mother, no popa, for daily troubles
But what I do stay true to the teachings I was taught
Thank momma for the gifts that she once bought
I never went to court, cause I never got caught
On the porch light it up, roll it up, you know that of course
Cause it's a cause, so don't get pushed off, bitch
I wanted to rap, so I said, fuck the office!
My team full of spartans, we are in this evil world
Assumptions stay blind behind closed doors
Until it hit the floor and it comes to the light
All I see is fame, in my spot late, uh!

[Hook x4]
Keep it steady, I'm ready for what you wanna do
I always stay true to never let my crew

My flow cross the ancient seas plus my a through z's
So basically you're misplaced if you're placed near me
Just wait and see, I scrape in with no latency
They're late to see, that Bishop's in the greatest lead
Remained fatigued, I laugh at you
No room for bad apples, I spend gas capsule
These start to .. mad habits
It's mad natural, for them cashes we just past you
The bad rascals got the game intact to them shackles
The 'crackles on your head and reach failure
I caught the smoke up and goes the tales that I tell you
'know I'm doping, nobody feel ya
Don't get realer than the shit I kick, my lungs will heal ya!
Feel that, nigga! Try to kill that, nigga!
Believe I'm the cure for the real, my nigga!
If you don't, you get eaten like, veal my niggas!
Sneak diss, you can turn into a meal, my niggas!

[Hook x8][Intro: Bishop Nehru]
Yeah, yeah. Fuck is up nigga?
Suburban Shoguns out this bitch, nigga
On some exhale shit. Fuck wrong with you niggas?
Bout to take over this Hip-Hop shit
Y'all niggas ain't Hip-Hop artists, y'all niggas is rappers
Get that shit right. We out here, nigga

[Verse 1: Que Hampton]
Check it, crack flows cracked floors when I'm stepping on
Your sound waves never heard it coming, nigga death did
Shit you gotta respect it, the Shogun on the record
Bound to chop the top off billboard slots
The autopsy read his head is departed from the necklace, the lettuce
So love Christ you get the message
Godly with this shit, so refreshing to know I got the flow to do in a dude reckless
Nigga sword to the stu'

[Verse 2: Bishop Nehru]
I'm battering lives with the pad n' the mic, bashin' the trife
Flows make em' grab for a knife
Before hoes thought he would go postal, now I'm killing em' global with all of these cold flows
Niggas don't know
How they gon' hate? They stay saying I'm cocky, niggas is not me, they back nigga don't jock me
I kill em' no probably, got mad bills no Cosby, started mad autopsies, who the fuck is gon' stop me?

[Verse 3: Que Hampton]
Que and the ruder niggas you figure it get no iller if
Iggy was with me the semi would surely hit ya
The mind a lethal weapon, I wreck it with lethal seconds, I'm lethal with the nine so
The breath will leave you at seven
Can't stand at sixteen, goddamn I spit mean
My flow slit wrists, hit arteries, just shit
My jet stream don't let em' get steam, I mean bad business
Show you what will happen in a casket, rap business

[Verse 4: Bishop Nehru]
Crossin' the seas in different seasons, leavin' beats in defeat when I'm speakin'
People greeting a God cause I go harder, any track know I slaughter, could probably sleep with ya daughter
I'll be on a-mission to straight riches, niggas ask to get on track, [?]
Now I'm the cat that dissin', I'm a lion, niggas lying, they ain't beating this kitten

[Verse 5: Que Hampton]
Awe shit, I'm rapping mad ign'ant, the black cat bad luck, but attacking with the writtens
Attacking all the kittens, they have to get their lickings
Eat it up, and beat it up, keys will lock dreams for cream
Drop-top beams, my themes drop top mean, she fiends for top speed
Which means hot rod fiend, never drop keys or weed in my pocket
And light it or spark it in the hearts that beats, beats, and beats the hardest

[Verse 6: Bishop Nehru]
Me n' Que Ham go Rambo, wheres the ammo, niggas ran home, we dismantle your mans hole
Jock and handle, these grand flows, we hot as a candle, so know that the fans go demand mode
No name drops, niggas not insane, they'll be all black like a gothic gang, got this game in a lock
It's strange cause nauseous lames spit all this nonsense that still got this fame, it's a shame..[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
First things first, I'm the realest (realest)
Drop this and let the whole world feel it (let 'em feel it)
And I'm still in the Murda Bizness
I can hold you down, like I'm giving lessons in physics (right, right?)
You should want a bad bitch like this (huh?)
Drop it low and pick it up just like this (yeah)
Cup of Ace, cup of Goose, cup of Cris
High heels, something worth a half a ticket on my wrist (on my wrist)
Taking all the liquor straight, never chase that (never)
Rooftop like we bringing '88 back (what?)
Bring the hooks in, where the bass at?
Champagne spilling, you should taste that

[Hook: Charli XCX]
I'm so fancy, you already know
I'm in the fast lane, from L.A. to Tokyo
I'm so fancy, can't you taste this gold?
Remember my name, 'bout to blow-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2: Bishop Nehru]
It's Baby Face Bishy with the tight fade
Part through the middle, yeah I had it since the tenth grade
But now I'm out globe roaming and I'm getting paid
The Emperor's reign and his Esca' paid
I'm finally escalating, gotta stay away from the hating
I'm seeing great things they awaiting
And I'm feeling the whole world's gravitation
So I know these statements ain't me thinking fake or basic
The chicks call me Bishy when they wasted
Got a couple dollars now they all trying to shake it
But can't fall in love till I got the right space
And I had to just add that your ass looks amazing
Got a thing for smashes, dresses and fat assets
But can't get distracted it's back to the track [?]
All of the attractions leaving them all trapped
In the back end, living so fancy no acting

[Verse 3: Iggy Azalea]
I said baby, I do this, I thought that, you knew this
Can't stand no haters, and honest, the truth is
And my flow retarded, each beat dear, departed
Swagger on stupid, I can't shop at no department
Better get my money on time, if they not money, decline
And swear I meant that there so much that they give that line a rewind
So get my money on time, if they not money, decline
I just can't worry 'bout no haters, gotta stay on my grind
Now tell me, who that, who that? That do that, do that?
Put that paper over all, I thought you knew that, knew that
I be that I-G-G-Y, put my name in bold
I been working, I'm up in here with some change to throw

[Hook: Charli XCX]

[Bridge: Charli XCX]
Trash the hotel, let's get drunk on the minibar
Make the phone call, feels so good getting what I want
Yeah, keep on turning it up
Chandelier swinging, we don't give a fuck
Film star, yeah, I’m deluxe
Classic, expensive, you don't get to touch, aow!

[Verse 4: Iggy Azalea]
Still stunting, how you love that?
Got the whole world asking how I does that
Hot girl, hands off, don't touch that
Look at it, I bet you wishing you could clutch that
That's just the way you like it, huh?
And so good, he's just wishing he could bite it, huh?
Never turn down nothing, slayin' these hoes
Gold trigger on the gun like

[Hook: Charli XCX]

[Outro: Iggy Azalea & Charli XCX] (x2)
Who that, who that? I-G-G-Y
That do that, do that, I-G-G-Y
Who that, who that? I-G-G-Y
(Blow-oh-oh-oh)[Produced by: Ghost McGrady]

[Sampled Intro: 2Pac]
I would tell each and every person out there
Doh-Forget about that click n up Sh-thing, you know what I mean?
Be to yourself, stay to yourself, trust nobody
TRUST NO-BODY
After dark, you know what I mean?
Straight up, my closest friends did me in
My closest friends, my homies, people who I done took care of they whole family
I done took care of everything for em, looked out for them, put em in the game
Everything! Turned on me!
Fear is stronger than love, remember that
Fear is stronger than love, all the love I gave, didn't mean nothing when it came to fear
So it's all good, but I'm a soldier, I always survive, I constantly come back
Ya know what I mean? Only thing that can kill me, is death, that's the only thing that will ever stop me, is death
And even then my music live forever

[Verse 1: Bishop Nehru]
Check!
I'm a genius when it comes to spittin' flows
My sixteens hard, don't act as if you didn't know
I'm laying low, not in a circle
But blowing O's and hoping that Buddha knows
That there's plenty of foes with four fours
Tryna get a nigga clipped quick!
It sick shit going on, but I try to stay calm, and focus on songs
Because ones that's doing wrong, tryna have me tag along
And word is bond, I rather bomb word vapor from bongs
That's word with no friends
No games when I hold pens, and these hoes, they hoping
That my heart, will open, and let em into the cash
But my mind sets lab
Like they did when I was in class, just struggling to pass
But at last I past them, with the stash and my live 10
You boyfriend ask him, he know that there's crack in my
Tracks when I rap, people clap and react fast
Because they know that Nehru and this rap shit is gonna last
It's the fact that I'm everything that you lack, nigga you whack
Don't act like I ain't murder these rappers with one track
The lights leak, the bright peak, start of the show
Now I got you, and your ho front row at my show, whoa!

[Bridge]
Now I got you, and your ho front row at my show, whoa!
You and your ho front row at my show, whoa! (whoa)
Now I got you, and your ho front row at my show, whoa!

[Verse 2: Bishop Nehru]
But shit slow, cause there's no entry
For ones that tryna tempt me
With ounces of sticky, and icky bitches that's tryna get me
Hit with a charge, cause the kid live large
In the stars is where I rest, and my bars they be the best
And I bust it out my chest
And clowns, I never stress
They seeing, they could progress
So they tryna get with the cheques
Hah! Fickle Mind$ tryna blind a nigga shine
My grind, never combine with people that's on the side
Because all of them living lies, and I be living these lines
Like lives, below foes, there's always a no-soul
Don't go "Oh No", when you notice the kid is global
When your ho's backstage giving me a slow blow
I know I spit advance right? That's why my advance right
I'm killing any rapper that stand with a pen and mic

[Outro]
Stay outta sight, and I'm tryna be polite
But I swear when a nigga write from the pen acetyl ignite
It's like(x3)[Verse 1]

You get crushed, this flow super deluxe
This hoes trying get bucks
It's slow, shorty good luck
My 4's don't give a fuck, I know they [?]
Talking tough, [?]
It's just, a little fickle
How you mention dimes and nickles
When your driving rentals, trying show you high in residential
Use your mental, the odds against you
Is it an issue that my tinsel got the worded issue
Coincidental
I suppose, niggas pose, I expose their toes
I'm a stone, in alone, I rip bones get stoned
Cause this flow gets souls and slit bones
Just know

[Outro]
Just know
Yeah
Just know
The illest flows, the realist though
I'm killing fours
Uhh, Uhhhh
Guess that's itOne-two one-two, check it

[Verse 1]
I'm spitting heavily over heavenly melodies
This hell I see is jealousy from people who just relish me
They better be, changing they mind by the time I'm 17
I guarantee my line's fine like they met with my weed
Ah, I'm taking L's like the Bobcats
Ya cats can't compare to me, niggas all wack
More crack in my lyrics than in vents for store's backs
Plus I paint my own pictures like a raw shaq
Momma's lies about pops was for my own protection
Imperfection, was my only given direction
While you hoes was in class and hosting erections
I was using my mind as a lethal weapon
People taking pictures
Vivid images got me reminiscing about the times I wasn't killing shit
But now I'm real and shit, and if you mad, you gonna be really pissed
When I'm at hotels and I'm shouting out "How real is this?"

[Hook]
It's the Golden Era, keep rhymes tight
Keep your dream on your mind, keep your dreams on your mind (Repeat x4)

[Verse 2]
I'm coming back with a vengeance
As darkness ascends, with my pen I repent it
Try and stop me, I roll you over and laugh
Cause disasters, now you acting like you William Shatner
My projects is more cheques, not more sex
I adore texts, not messages but I'm on next
And if a nigga mad, I rip him with no remorse
Show my force, I'm a young Skywalker when I show reports
These fake niggas acting funny like I did it
No attention come when you ???
Stop acting, you ain't catching on buddy
We wouldn't be close friends if you was new to the country

If you was new to the country, we wouldn't be friends if you was new to the country (Repeat x2)

Ah, nine-six, one-fiveMake this shit sound a little raw

Not a day passes that the glass doesn't spill
Because my happiness and sadness interact before the thrill
I'm a magnet to distractions and haphazard fill
Then a hazardous feel, feeling panic but still
The manic man's mechanic's been ended and killed
Like they slipped him a pill of Ritalin [?]
But the real ordeal
That will seal the notion was [concerned to?]
Now concerting with the [?]
Cos I'm who they heard of, an alien to earth
Like I'm the Silver Surfer, plus [Yerpa?]
In a burner, made them all a little bit sterner
But I never rush the slow learner
Just plant the seeds so they see and grow further
The glass [?]
Still I'm blue, looking Grover
Cos some years went over
And my dearest still ain't steering over
So I'm hoping for a clover
To help me win it over

[Chorus]x2
Life moves fast when you're rapped or a task
And it's cries and it's laughs in this harmony glass
It spills and refills and they all seem to clash
This future is past in this harmony glass

A quarter to my cup runneth over
Still I'm sober
So I take it back to half with some jazz bossanova
The floor is my composure before the spills cross
And expose the loner who's [bold didn't those throw them into a comas?]
All about that dough, no Homer
And I'm no condoner, just don't erupt your doper
Blowing [?], so the aroma's in the [?] stuck show with
No fucks, I just stroll with the funk
Plus a bit of punk, and crunk, soul and bumping trunk
But the junk got them drunk
So my glass adds up
Had enough of the bad luck
But corresponding to a [?] didn't have a chuck
Cos I go for goals like hockey pucks
And they plotting to stop but could not conduct
I've got a glass that's filled
But I will clean it up
In the next refill, I'm gonna fill to the [top?]

[Chorus]x5[Intro]
[Star Trek monologue about love from the 1999 episode "The Disease"]

[Verse 1]
Your eyes they seen lies
And tears have fallen too
Your mind has been corrupted by guys who want you
But not you for who you are
But what you have and what they need
All they see is you on your knees and ready to please
But not me
See I was different
I was giving you a chance
I let you know in advance
I wasn't there for your pants
But that didn't seem to matter
Cause in the end you scattered
There's a pattern
But I let it go
Because I know what your after
It's love
Really, it's love
The one sent from above
The one that gives you kisses
And lay with you in the tub
The one you with at night and he givin your back a rub
And maybe the guy that you with
That actually give you a hug
That's love
But what do you have?
A nigga with a few tats, two hats, and a temper that's
Leaving your body parts black and blue
You need too
Leave this fool soon
Before he do something major and there's no more you to do
It's Nehru

[Hook]
No tears
I don't want to see you cry x3
Don't cry
Wipe the tears from your eyes x3
I said don't cry, please
I don't want to see you cry

[Verse 2]
Days past you with him
I don't get it what's going on
I coulda sworn your heart is with this man had torn
I'm on tour
Thinking of you is what I cannot have
Cause you with a lad who grabs you and throwing you jabs
And it's sad because you love-struck, I mean he was your first
So that gives the nigga a reason to yell at you and to curse?
Why? because he's a man bigger than you and he
Demands you to stand while he sets the stand
To follow all his plans
Fuck it
You don't need him
Leave him
He's foolish to let you go
That's what he basically did
When he threw those blows
I know it's gonna be hard
But you can find a way through
I promise to help you find it
You just gotta want to

[Hook][Intro]
Uh
Yeah
Check check (check check)
Uh
Take over your shit
No guns on the run
Take over your shit
Shoguns on the run

[Verse 1]
I'm used to being alone
Just me and symphonies
Now I'm never prone
And these interviewers are sent to me
Sympathy? Show none to foes
I'm shogun, don't hold guns
But know that the flows stun
So hoes run, in my direction
Still striving for perfection
Addressing shorty undressing
She testing I'm heavy stressing
The lesson is take lesser hits
When there's messes near
Cause sentences
Get sentimented into ten
With pens I'm ten
My flow gold you low bro
Plus my vocals
Leave local hoes boastful
They happier than me
Shit

[Verse 2]
I'm used to being alone
Just me and symphonies
Now I'm never home
And the bloggers eager to get to me
Vividly, living these dreams
That others wish to me
Filing beats, writing these lines
That bring them to their feet
Defeat is far, no bars
Go far as far goes
We discard hoes
And disregard harmfuls
We harm foes no arms tho just hard flows
I sparkle, you can spark more
You narks know
I can keep you stressin'
To confess about the weapon I was blessin'
They just test wit
Now lets get out of this quickly
You trying to get me
For holding a piffy
But that ain't my history
Don't diss please
I'm displeased
It's sickening what I been seeing
Rather stricling the flip kings and sing sing
Flip kings and sing sing
Yeah[Produced by the 9th Wonder]

[Verse 1: Bishop Nehru]
Since a kid I been a loner, it’s whatever though
Shit, I guess I made it up the pedestal
Using new sounds, refusing to move pounds
Came a dude from the ground who’s shooting for the crown
No spoofing around and no more deception
Removed it like infections, learned a lesson
It’s still lame lesson, myself I’m investing
The next gen, spreading affection, affecting
He’ll lift them up, a couple more vibes came
And changed some lives, making ancients cry
I hope they hear and I hope they tear
They ain’t never want me, now I’m always near
They always in my ear, I see they ain’t sincere
Then disappear, must stand clear of those who interfere
So yeah, I’m all alone in my basement
Still trying to make my way from the pavement

[Hook]
Isolated, yeah, I’m on my own
Yeah, I’m on my own
Yeah, I’m on my own
Isolated, yeah, I’m on my own
Yeah, I’m on my own
Yeah, I’m on my own
So I’m, isolated (x8)

[Verse 2: Bishop Nehru]
They said I would never glisten
Then they sat and actually had to listen
Now I’m smashing and I grab attention
My Tumblr’s blowing up and everybody’s in my mentions
I turn the television on and now I’m in the listings
This is all getting interesting, I’m inching in
Attentions and visions went through thick and thin
Problematic system kid, they predicted when
Listening to the teachers they would never believe us
Caring more about their checks than our respect
It made me upset and just wanted to get away from it all
Erasing this small now I’m off like a rocket in my room
With the Boondocks, the other option , I guess
Is write a track, if it ain’t that then it’s probably take a nap
No filling out the gaps, uh, the last to relax
But a natural born class act

[Hook]

[Outro]
And I hate it…(laughing)
