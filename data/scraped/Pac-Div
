[Verse 1: Mibbs]
Shout out to my thick girls, thick girls

Got a mixed girl with curls
Got me a rich girl with pearls
Neither one is cooking better than my big girl, big girl
Come get this dick girl, dick girl
Better come quick girl, quick girl
I like girls who come with girls and I like girls who fuck with girls
It's too easy, I'm too steezy
Drinking Fiji, watching TV

Girls pee pee when we be rhyming
You see me I'm rocking diamonds
Grit my teeth, yea I be grinding
P-A-C see we be shining
2-seater bitch, we reclining
Top down, armor all'd up
Got that brown up in my cup
Got that bomb fired up

[Verse 2: Skeme]
Drop that Breitling for the Hublot
Boy I got nothing but time
And I tell her momma to keep her cat
Till I show my dick what's on her mind
Lemme get that head! Lemme get that head!
Girl I need that head
Screaming Inglewood forever
I sip that purple and bleed that red
Niggas know wassup, these girls wanna fuck with me
I'm on that same shit
Crooked or call me Mr. Never-Seen-With-The-Same-Bitch
Swear I had on Polo out in Soho smoking skunk
And I had 4 hoes in that 4-door with my .44 in my trunk
Underground niggas, independent getting checks though
Boy I spit that sick shit, flow like I got strep throat
Duke and Pac Divvy, we get busy, get the bidness
Baby girl you in the presence of the kings, bear witness

[Hook]
Top down, yeah I'm the man
I'm from LA, I got that juice and I got a plan
Girls just hop in I drop the roof
We can get a tan
So when you see me, I'll be speeding like a demon
With my head out the window screaming: top down!

[Verse 3: Be Young]
I got a hundred dollars on me
Finna head straight to the store
Smoking on that headband, it goes straight to your skull
Lincoln Continental flow, player player Romey Rome
These niggas finna hate, and that list is gonna be long
Just been in my chromosome
(?), Home Alone
Corvettes and rolling stones
Them boys fresh they know they wrong
And I got guess in my cologne
She be guessing wrong
When niggas cut you short, make sure your checks is long
This that upper echelon, Rambo with ammo
Fat boy shit, had them niggas rocking camo
Cold-blooded mammal but the bitches keep me warm
They only doing shit that they seen us on

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Casey Veggies]
I don't got nothing to prove
Been stack bucks since I left school
These hoes say I think I'm to cool
But I guess some girls get fooled
I'm this young nigga that do
Riding around with my crew
Wanna way to pay for more dudes
That's my day today, (?)
(?)
My swag sayin' I'm best
The streets sayin' I'm next
Excuse me if I flex
I just do my thing in my own zone
Always wait for the right time
My main chick got a real nigga
She know I got guidelines
Homeboy I'm on tour
In a hotel, tryin' to make more
Do 60 shows, nigga that's the goal
If you can't tell we livin' well
You should put your hand up for me, pants 340
You should do it too girl, ya man suck don't he
(?), throw the alley oop
Might throw it back
Then I probably

[Verse 1: Mibbs]
Show out for the girls and get your ass whipped
On some 8th grade, right front of the class shit
You gon' try to test me but I'mma pass it
I'm a motherfuckin' genius and you in some bad shit
Step 'round a corner with my crewneck on
Hammer can't touch me, man I'm too hands on
I don't know you man, we ain't never been to school together
We ain't ever shared weed, bitches, or ate food, never!
They say money never sleeps, gotta have two hustles
Since I'm bagging duffels, I got ashy knuckles
Carry 'em to the bank, now I got big muscles
Man I do my thing, I got fans in Brussels

[Hook]
Y'all think I made it, I'm just getting started

That's too much information, my bad, I'm sorry
We got syndication, our shit go hardest)
And that's why she choose and that's why you lose, my nigga you garbage
Not to be harsh but fuck it, your bitches look parched and busted
And I bet that you be carpet munching, that shit we spark be skunking
That Pep√© Le Pew and you know we be repping the crew
Pac Div, you second to who? Maaaaan, ain't nobody be checking for you
Must we remind again, must you rewind again
I'm off three Heinekens, and this shit is effortless too
I done stepped on your shoes and spit in your face
Disrespected yo bitch in your place
You still want a autograph? Gimme a break, I'm sick and disgraced
These niggas is fake, bitches is fake, man shit is just fake
I just stay to myself, I don't get in the way
Got bread to get, got head to get, rap etiquette, don't edit this
Need evidence, been repping it, ever since... bitch!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: BeYoung]
We overfaded in the function and we getting started
Shit, a nigga blew three blunts 'fore we finished parking
That OG make a nerd broad get retarded
A pretty bitch's dream, a freaky bitch's Mr. Marcus
Popping up for that revenue, standing tall like I'm 7'2"
You ain't cut from that same cloth, hell nah we ain't gettin' no checks with you
No you can't get no checks with me, get these niggas from next to me
Backstage drinking up the Yac, nigga you ain't get no text from me
Shit pull up, I can pump your brakes, that's dopeboy shit we pumping base
Flex so hard my muscles ache, stack that bread then tuck the safe
If it's game day, I quarterback, that's on me, them boys is back
All I know is that fly shit, got pimp game on my boarding pass

[Bridge: Raven Sorvino]
Fuck what you talking 'bout, I be making G's
Posted up in the parking lot, dangling my keys
Fuck what you talking 'bout, I was overseas
Posted up, Polo down, catch me dangling my keys

[Verse 4: Mac Miller]
If you try, you'll find I'm rhyming in some Iversons
In the ocean, riding dolphins, grab 'em by the fin
Uh, yea bitch I'm ten feet tall
Bunch of hoes playing with my beach balls
The money in the way, I don't see y'all
Finally making paper legal
Bitch I'm flyer than a seagull
Fresh as fuck, that's by default
I hit Schoolboy Q to borrow bucket hats
Why you talking little homie, go and run a lap
Fuck that shit, I been ether
Have these bitches running like a gym teacher
So you can go and do a hundred drills
Twenty years old with a couple mill
It's nothing, I'mma go for more
Just became a wizard, bitch I'm Okafor

These some raps out the fucking baking soda drawer
Yea I spit that crack bitch

Get stomped out, smacked up, ambulances, fire trucks
Wired up, high as fuck, making loot, you drying up
You stay at home, we flying out, you falling off, we climbing up
And I'm too cool for these ratchet bitches
Too cool for these average niggas
Who the-- who the fuck asked you, niggas?
Vroom vroom, I move past you niggas
Posted, laid low, in the cut like nigga, what?

We drinking on them chickens, homes, you sending hoes, that paypal
I bend a corner and break out, Betty Crocker that cake, wow
Down to earth but I'm spaced out, pound of herb, now break down
I'm lamping, I'm low-key, my mind be on my business
I'm remy martin cup sipping, might be out for Christmas
Might be out at Fox Hills, might be out at Lenox
Them yellow broads with me like they might be out the Simpsons
Right beside my pimpin, that's the only way to get it
Catch a nigga lamped up, only way of living

Save the tough talk and you clowns are churros
Sweet boy, we got heat boy, you a decoy, so please quit
My soldiers have been deployed, you get destroyed, you in deep shit
Beastin, beastin, solid like Ironman
And while that iron hot I put that California crease in

[Intro]
Niggas is farting...
Here's...use the spray nigga

[Verse 1: Big Mibbs]
I'm a tall ass nigga, 6'1 160
Fresh out the pack like somebody just un-zipped me
I'm with the crew so you know I got that skunk with me
I'm Ashin Kusher but you know there ain't no punk in me
Shout out to Twitter, I follow a bunch of dumb beezies
Figured if I want to get her it'd be dumb easy
Send her a direct message, "Hey baby come see me"
I like my eggs scrambled, I like my girls easy
For now, till then I'mma let that money pile
Can't wait for you to say that I've been acting funny style
Cause im a late bloomer, still growin' like a tumor
You know a nigga made it when your hearing gay rumors
Fuck the cop, the deputy and the state trooper
I'm in the game for longevity, not a chain stupid
Type of nigga that be ridin' in the rain roofless
Told y'all man that he's a lame, and you're the same: useless

[Hook]
If I don't like it then that shit is useless
Talk is cheap man that shit is useless
You chasing hoes man that shit is useless
You trying to wife her man her pussy useless
Damn, man that shit is useless
A couple grand, but that shit is useless
Ain't talkin' cash man that shit is useless
Say you the man but that shit is useless

[Verse 2: Like]
Do it how it supposed to be
Now these girls notice me
Now I'm baggin chicks, I use to bag groceries
Use to rap locally, now we travel globally
All around the world off some shit I just wrote in 3 minutes
All truth no pre-tending
And since she's shallow, I'ma go deep in it
These rap dudes is funny boy, I'm peep in it
Look, I fathered your style, you are my dependent
Flow sick, need a free clinic
Beast in it, please quit it
Murdered this shit before the beat finished
Hang yourself, get the nooses
Cause even explaining myself is useless

[Verse 3: Be Young]
She got your nose wide open
Sneeze and it feels like the doors wide open
Seen her on Povich, showin' off ass
She got the beamer towed and that was just last week
She got them fast feet, you trying to get with her
She got you going out, you always get dinner
Say she from above, I say the bitch Hitler
She got the Laker game, but fuck with all the Clippers
And I bet she drink all the liquor
Everytime we go out, the bitch fallin' quicker
Pain in the ass, shit that we call a splinter
Don't get mad when you see me and I call her useless

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Asher Roth]
You the rotten keg tapper
No name havin' lookin' raggot lame rapper
You nut hugger, butt buddy, fudge packer
(okay enough of that)
My real friends call me Asher, (laughter)
What kind of name is that, bro dude? It's so stupid
I bet your in a frat or two
What are you Jewish?
Are you good in math, play flute, row crew?
Shit, if you can't be used well then I guess you're useless
Ulysses S. Grant, we should start a Revolution
Or a Civil War, whatever your into kids
Down for whatever let's just go ahead and do it
Do it out loud, talk dog fuckin' prove it
Shoot towards the hoop and get the boot like it was soccer
Now they ask what happen to you, silk the shocker
Yeah it's true, I went and moved to Philly, Kevin Stocker
New kid on the block, they say I'm off my John Rocker
Hey and nowadays im the young grasshopper
Cool Calm Collect having fun with Cindy Lauper
Never Dennis Hopper with Keanu Reeves
More like Bill and Ted since I started smoking weed
Now all we do is time travel in phone booths
Go to '82, head it back to the old school
When there was no rules, bullshit heroics
(WHERE DID EVERYBODY GO?)
Guess that we're The Last Poets
Is there no hope, that this generation blow it?
All about the dough, the glow and the moet
At least some more Bone Thugs or some fuckin' Big Pun
Give it up bro, all of these kids are plain dumb
And you're useless

[Hook][Hook]
I got my cross-trainers on, motherfucker, I run shit
All I do is rap, make dough for the dumb shit
The return of that 808 trunk hit
Cash in my palm, I'mma pass the baton, GO!
Cross trainers on my motherfuckin' feet (go!)
Cross trainers on my motherfuckin' feet (go!)
Cross trainers on my motherfuckin' feet

You be on that fuck shit, I'm tryin' to make bucks quick
Don't talk to me if money ain't the subject
93's laced up, we about to run shit
Mibbs right beside me, BeYoung got the blunt lit
Shawn on the cut, Swiff D on the drum kits
Standin' on your table with a bottle and a drunk bitch
Fallin' all over spillin' drinks, tryin' to tongue kiss
Money over hoes, so you know I ain't the one, Miss
Take her home, make her moan, and when I get done: (Switch!)
Pass her off like a basketball
Stay with dimes, I'm like Nash to y'all
My living room look like a casting call
Don't be bringing hoes with Noassatall
A sweet talkin' nigga, ask your mom
My nigga, that's your squad?
We treat line-ups like that's Lebron
Push backwards like the bush whackers
We ain't just kush rappers - we max it out like FootAction

[Hook]

[Verse 2: BeYoung]
Nigga hand over fist, bring some cash in this bitch
Y'all niggas picture near puttin' swag in your spliffs
My niggas cop the 7 just to laugh at the 6
Like "nigga, do you know how much ass I'mma get?"
Wrote a plan out, let's dip, we can market and sing
Put that cash in a stash, save that part for the rent
Only way niggas swingin' is to target the fence
That's why everything we're singing hit the target like Prince, man
I'm talkin' vanity and "Can it be?"'s
Stickin' to the strategy, how simple can it be?
Niggas comin' home we gon' put them on the salary
Niggas think they cold 'til we push our shit to Calgary

[Verse 3: Blu]
Yea, you're who-blah and your shoe rot
You're too shy to be Rah Rah, your due ska
You're new job from Calgary to the new spot
Threw that 2pac on, but couldn't ride like we used 'ta
Used up, you're new guy's shoe size
Drew ties, never move pies move lines
She do lines why we shoot rhymes, shoo fly
Don't bother the father, just let me do mine

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Mibbs]
It's notorious, peep it
Y'all niggas is Victoria's Secret
Soft as Mom's lingerie
It's a man's world boy, put the pom-poms away
It's only right we got our palms on LA
Cause if Pac was alive, you'd get bombed on today
Bombs bombs away, like 'Bron 'Bron and Wade
We been had next, now it's our time to play, nigga

[Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar]
Your false prophets will never jump in my pockets
You're poppin' your gums and I'm poppin' your optics
Optimus Prime when I'm done
And the topic of music is me
And the logic is usually
You should stop in and grab a degree
In the science of how to emcee
And I'm watchin' the critics critique
When I'm climbing the valleys and peaks
And aligning myself
While I'm riding Orion's belt
In the street and defiling this beat
As a dead bitch that lay at my feet
This is King shit...

[Hook][Hook]

You're my number 1 (one!)
No matter what you do
I know I drive you crazy
But you always be my favorite

You're my number 1 (one!)
You better know you are
The only one I think of when I dream
Please stay with me tonight!

[Verse 1: Mibbs]
We had a falling out
I was on some bullshit and she called me out
That little thing called pride what's it all about?
We went and turned a happy home into a haunted house (Right?)
But if you gotta bounce, you gotta bounce
So go and get your DJ Unk on and "Walk It out"
You think I'm hatin' since you got a new baller now
He ain't no man, he dunno how to tear them walls down
You see me at the club, so you wanna call me now
You cheated on him with me, so you feeling sorry now
On some real shit I think we need to cut it out
Cause I just showed up at your new apartment unannounced
Why?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Be Young]
DJ play her favorite song on the radio
French tip, painted toes
Tryin to set the skype up wherever I say we go
Dope like Ralio, coups of painted gold
Take it to the bedroom, movie star playin' roles
New Jane Fonda, damn that's a skyda
Ass so fat, you can't fit it in ya Honda
Part time student, but you still rollin' ganja
Right before class still hit me with the noggin
(Right?) Nevermind, I'm just playin' with you
This ain't the ordinary that I'm tryin' to say to you
I spend a day with you, let Mary Kay hit you
Make 'em wonder why we stay official
I'm with you
Why?

You lookin' lovely my dear

Love you when you smell good, love you when you musty
Love you when you curvy even love you when you husky
You love the way I fuck you, I love you when you touch me
It must be, something about the way you always shine
When these other bitches dusty, love you cause you trust me
Love me when I'm dead broke, ridin' on the bus
When I be in the crunch, you provide me with a crutch
Somethin' like fisher, lively in the clutch
Tell me go deep everytime I'm in yo guts
When I be on a roll, I might be gone for months
But you you ain't never worry
That's what's up
You're my number 1

Just another day out in sunny LA
There's dealers in the streets and the coppers don't play

Killas on my side case u suckas wanna try us
Numbers in my phone, I'm so player
Feelin' so good I think I might run for mayor

I might run for mayor
Nigga ask your momma I'm a muthafuckin' player
If I see your girlfriend starin', I'm a take her
That's word to my cousin up in Oakland with the scraper
501 jeans yeah that's my flavor
Crew neck sweaters in the club, fuck a blazer
Button up under case the bouncer is a hater
Straight to the bar for a couple shots of jaeger
If I see a nice thin light skin I'm a game her
Tell her I'm big Mibbs and I'm runnin' for mayor
She digs my speeds and guess where I'm a take her
Back to the crib where I can blaze her
Modern Joe Frazier second round knock out
When I pull the cock out, baby see you later
I think around 8 or 9 I'm a wake her up
Kick her out, then go pick up my paper

[Hook]

I might run for mayor
Cruise through the city in a booger green pacer
Got ya girl wit me, I'm so player
Pullin' hoes since Bo Jackson was a Raider
Everything's tailored, from the Chuck Taylor's
Check the steering wheel in my car, that's gator
Sip liquor straight, I don't need chasers
Drink a pint of hen, I'm cursin' like a sailor
I'm so major, sit back and watch me
Bought my 501's and my sweater from the swap meet
Music up loud, coppers wanna stop me
Mad cuz I'm young black makin' that broccoli
Hangin' wit the possie, niggas wanna copy
But I'm too fly so the squares can't jock me
Watch how they jock me, I'm so player
Feelin' so good I think I might run for mayor

[Hook]

Yeah I might run for mayor
I'm scandalous with the papers
LA county, the planet of the gangsters
Get ya cameras and tapers
Ya boy hustle hard like Rambis for the Lakers
Riding by zoom but we boom wit the base muffle
Fly as a space shuttle, cool as a rain puddle
Who wanna make trouble
Pimp hand heavy no half stepping
Like old school Daddy Kane for ya
Its a shame on you, what you lames gone do
You's a bitch, we make it rain on you
Yea the dames come through
We decked out with hoes, draw circles around tens
Then ex out the O's, boy check out my pose
Stand smith classic fresh out the grove
Look who crept out the stove
Keep a bad one like she fresh out the Vouge
Then we go shopping like we fresh out the clothes
Gimme that, shopping bags, popping tags, I'm a smash
From the side of the tracks, where the homies talk trash
You can only sight see if you got a pass, the mayor

Feeling like I'm Moses flyer than a pharaoh
Tired of all you posers, tired of all you weirdos
Tired of all you hoes leaving make up on my pillows
Shout out my latinos, let's count this dinero

Coming up I was influenced by some khaki niggas
Homie got them action figures, homie you can't match the vigor
You ain't really that tough, homie that's the liquor
Popov got you talking fast like you rap with Twista

That is not my wallet miss, yeah, I'm big headed but don't make it so obvious
I'm traveling the globe now, working on my politics
Running for head of the state on my Barack shit
Cut your fucking head on the plate on some Baraka shit
Every verse I murder I don't care what the topic is
Got a few mistress down in Texas that I polly with
All of them is winners and I coach them like Popovich
Pop the Cris no wait up, pop that Smart Water
Staying sober just in case I gotta dive in shark water
Lady killer, heart robber, stick em quietly then I release
Then I am peace, deuces like a siamese, gone[Verse 1: BeYoung]
Sucka free, duck a lollipop
Where we from, niggas say words like "molliwop"
Play curbs and ?, broads holler when they see me
Just add water, popping condoms in the Fiji
Take it off girl I'm greedy, off top skeezy
SoCal niggas, middle finger to the peedy
Money on the phone while I'm breaking down bleezys
Before we did a song, we was taking down -
How they make it sound easy, still it do damage
Jolly green giant, my niggas move cabbage
Got drink, got dank, shit that's all that matter
Tank on E, but the homie bought the Madden

Straight down the block, bass wopping like hell
Grown ass man but I rock like I'm 12
So fuck groupies I'm jocking myself

If you ain't about that then why you mislead me
We made it here grinding, you made it here simping
Bitches in the living room and they in here stripping
Late night visits from your wavy haired vixen
Said you too soft cause your baby hair glistening
Aviator frames and them 808s that bang
We them niggas Pac Div case you hoes forgot the name[Verse One : Mibbs]
See back in high school I used to love to see you out in the bleachers
The reason why I couldn't pay attention to teachers
The first day I seen you, I knew you were a keeper
Fly from your hair to the sole of your sneakers
Your first boyfriend didn't know how to treat ya
You laughed when you heard I put his ass in a sleeper
Cause he didn't deserve you, cause he had the nerve to
Disrespect ya momma keep you out past curfew
March 31st was the day of my pursuit
May 25th was the day of our first woooo
June 13th was the day that I hurt you
And all you did was leave me with the trace of your perfume
September 4th the new school year started
And I heard you with Marvin well I heard he's retarded
I Conjured up a plan to break you up with your man
And it all worked well we got back by college
He don't Hit It like I hit it boo, not like how big Mibbs Do
My connection is spiritual, I'll be raising my kids with you
You just keep your body tight, make-up sex every time we fight
I'll get you a ring when the time is right
When your mind is right and mine is right
Dynamite, I'm in flight
Feeling is if this feeling is wide open
And I'm floating, to that wider light
Hope you wear your tights tonight, you know that's like my favorite theme
Washing up with that Maybelline, like I'm hearing an angel sing (angel sing)

We promised we'd show up, we just had to straightening business
Cause some was hating bitches, we out here chasing riches
Was plotting on your spot while y'all was flossing taking pictures, cheese!
Cheddar cheese, hella trees, smell the weed
We blowing, we floating, seven seas, speed boating
Tell 'em freeze, we going for the safe
See that weapon he's holding, he's going for the face, red dot
Head shot, we roll up in that place, nine deep
No line, no admission, nice try, no permission
I'm fly, no magician trick, this is it, Mr.Ritz
Even Ferragamo, with some vintage shit
Don't mention kicks 'less they 808's or
You rocking some classic shit they don't make boy
I'mma tell you, I've been beasting on these tracks
These other niggas thinking they can rap
Til you throw 'em in the pit and watch them sleeping on they backs (Damn)
Bending corners, tipping over, sipping on some Henn and Cola
Basketball Champ, can drop 20 in some penny loafers
Killa Cal, this the style, blow them whistles on ya
Raised where the cops can't wait to pull them pistols on ya

[Hook]

[Outro]
So glad were back together
So glad were back together
And I'll never let you go
(Aw Yea, AW Yeea)[Verse 1: Mibbs]
Man what's it going to take?
Always making ground breaking shit that don't break?
All the corny ass nigga got cake
So how much of my corny ass shit it' gon' take
Time to rob a bank
Walk in that bitch like show me the safe
My girl nervous she think I'm gon' shake
Cause I'm pacing like a schizophrenic nigga on crank, damn
That's what I do, buy a mask and a suit
If the bitch behind the counter move her ass, I'mma shoot
Val Kilmer and De Niro in this ho
Got a driver outside in the Beamer: let's go
High speed chase on the 405
Helicopter in the skies so you know it's live
This morning I woke up, got high
I was broke, until I got a call from my guy saying

[Hook x8]
"What you think man? Time to rob a bank"

[Verse 2: Be Young]
We can hit every Bank of America
Before 5 we could hit this Chase, nigga hurry up
Money on my mind, got me pit bull terrier
Want what's inside, in the shit that's with the carrier
Stocking cap on right now, I ain't sporting waves
Just my niggas in the building and we sporting K's
Just bag it up we can dip before the boys is paged
Guaranteed what we make we be copping more than J's
Popping with them federals
See how they feel once we up out that Jetta though
Straight cash what the fuck I need a debit for
Barack understand we all fresh out the ghetto

[Hook x8]

[Verse 3: Mibbs]
Fuck that bitch, that goofy ass bitch
She a slut, that ho, that goofy ass bitch
Had me mixed up in some goofy ass shit
Talking bout me online, that's a groupie ass bitch
What you think man? We trying to rob a bank
I got bills, I got dreams, I need gas in my tank

[Verse 4: Like]
Slanging lean, slanging pills, making crack, serving base
Black mask, black mags, grabbing cash off the safe: run
Plotting schemes off of weed and some Grand Marnier
Big faces like Chinese anime
Swole faces like Ike did Annie Mae
Make a dash, take my ass up to San Jose
Dip in, counting my grip
Want to shut her ass up, put her mouth on my dick
Ay - fuck around, put a round on my clip
Pull the money out the drawer, bitch I'm down for my clique

[Hook x8][Produced by Thelonious Martin]

[Verse 1: Mibbs]
Show out for the girls and get your ass whipped
On some 8th grade, right front of the class shit
You gon' try to test me but I'mma pass it
I'm a motherfuckin' genius and you in some bad shit
Step 'round a corner with my crewneck on
Hammer can't touch me, man I'm too hands on
I don't know you man, we ain't never been to school together
We ain't ever shared weed, bitches, or ate food, never!
They say money never sleeps, gotta have two hustles
Since I'm bagging duffels, I got ashy knuckles
Carry 'em to the bank, now I got big muscles
Man I do my thing, I got fans in Brussels

[Hook]
Y'all think I made it, I'm just getting started
Man I'm just saying, that shit retarded
Y'all think I made it, I'm just getting started
Man I'm just saying, y'all shit retarded

[Verse 2: Like (and Mibbs)]
(I just got excited, man I almost farted
That's too much information, my bad, I'm sorry
We got syndication, our shit go hardest)
And that's why she choose and that's why you lose, my nigga you garbage
Not to be harsh but fuck it, your bitches look parched and busted
And I bet that you be carpet munching, that shit we spark be skunking
That Pep√© Le Pew and you know we be repping the crew
Pac Div, you second to who? Maaaaan, ain't nobody be checking for you
Must we remind again, must you rewind again
I'm off three Heinekens, and this shit is effortless too
I done stepped on your shoes and spit in your face
Disrespected yo bitch in your place
You still want a autograph? Gimme a break, I'm sick and disgraced
These niggas is fake, bitches is fake, man shit is just fake
I just stay to myself, I don't get in the way
Got bread to get, got head to get, rap etiquette, don't edit this
Need evidence, been repping it, ever since... bitch!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: BeYoung]
We overfaded in the function and we getting started
Shit, a nigga blew three blunts 'fore we finished parking
That OG make a nerd broad get retarded
A pretty bitch's dream, a freaky bitch's Mr. Marcus
Popping up for that revenue, standing tall like I'm 7'2"
You ain't cut from that same cloth, hell nah we ain't gettin' no checks with you
No you can't get no checks with me, get these niggas from next to me
Backstage drinking up the Yac, nigga you ain't get no text from me
Shit pull up, I can pump your brakes, that's dopeboy shit we pumping base
Flex so hard my muscles ache, stack that bread then tuck the safe
If it's game day, I quarterback, that's on me, them boys is back
All I know is that fly shit, got pimp game on my boarding pass

[Bridge: Raven Sorvino]
Fuck what you talking 'bout, I be making G's
Posted up in the parking lot, dangling my keys
Fuck what you talking 'bout, I was overseas
Posted up, Polo down, catch me dangling my keys

[Verse 4: Mac Miller]
If you try, you'll find I'm rhyming in some Iversons
In the ocean, riding dolphins, grab 'em by the fin
Uh, yea bitch I'm ten feet tall
Bunch of hoes playing with my beach balls
The money in the way, I don't see y'all
Finally making paper legal
Bitch I'm flyer than a seagull
Fresh as fuck, that's by default
I hit Schoolboy Q to borrow bucket hats
Why you talking little homie, go and run a lap
Fuck that shit, I been ether
Have these bitches running like a gym teacher
So you can go and do a hundred drills
Twenty years old with a couple mill
It's nothing, I'mma go for more
Just became a wizard, bitch I'm Okafor
Same shit you been told before
These some raps out the fucking baking soda drawer
Yea I spit that crack bitch
Mac Div[Verse 1: Fashawn]
I was in love with the block, call it the avenue Jones
Through the village we just happened to roam
Knuckleheads, bad to the bone
And every single snotnose had an addict at home
I drunk Vodka and juice with the fatherless youth
Everyday in between the hours of two we ate taco's and hoot
Every now and then somebody would shoot
They hit that younging with a stray while he was tying his shoe
Let if off then they hopped in the coupe
And nobody said a word about the body on the curb
Hit the homie Flacko, that's the vato with the herb
I mean papi cool, but his posse full of herbs
Got a Chronic from the 'burbs
Around the same time I was trying to learn
How to pick a lock with a hanger, load shots in the chamber
Get low from the cops and the neighbors
Boys in the hood

[Verse 2: Like]
Born and raised in killa Cali, dreaming one day the city's ours
Young niggas hopping fences licking chili powder
Eddie Bauers and doctors passed, Stockton to Ladera Heights
Young kids wearing Nike's sharing bikes, tearing mics up
Kept a nice cut in the fades
Never affiliated, but my niggas bang getting paid
Shouts to my grandma, still in the J's
Coco ave. fo-fo mag tucked away when the po-po's pass
Walked to the stove, but don't step on the old folk grass
A 80's baby like Thrifty's and Pick 'N Save
Wear the wrong colors might as well dig your grave
Ditch your school to throw hands, stick and move
Bagging chicks at Fox Hills like shit was cool
Different dudes, go by a set of different rules
We obviously ain't got shit to lose, boys in the hood

[Verse 3: Blu]
I got the old 3 sitting on my neck for my set
Big B sitting on my chest for the best
Headed to the East, raised in the West
In them streets I think you need a cage and a vest
Ducking strays on my way to church, on my way to work
Blazed trying to lace a verse so I can pay the first
Blu be copping chains, shopping days 'til my pockets hurt
Rob a purse if she see me in a soggy shirt
But on the turf niggas flipping work, chickens chirp
On a flirt, nonsense, no smirk, jerkface, tell the jerk
Burgers in a shank
If she think she worth what she work she need a break
Pissing off the city with a silly cigarette on my BMX
With my Rollie on and my Holy text
Telling Moses ''you can lead us through the sea''
But you can't keep seas out the streets
Boys in the hood

[Verse 4]
After school niggas eating Cheeto's by the tether-ball
Tony Starks had me fiending for them leather Clarks
5-0-1's, I'm starched, creased up
Niggas going chesting, we watched Darkwing duck
Bad niggas rocking duck tails, thermos with the lunch pail
Taking trips to Catalina and niggas swear we upscale
Puff L's, OE cans of Mickey
Real Venice before they turn that shit to Abbot Kinney
That past is in me skating through that 818
Homies out the pen like Ray Lewis gaining weight
It ain't for play
Thought you know them boys that banging the whole hood
Shook, just off of Northridge quaking
Ta-daw, nigga, domino!, my uncle bumped the Commodores
Humping on the sub and just be done before their mama home
Reminiscing with these poisonous goods
Dopeboy, get that dope, boy, boys in the hood

[Verse 5]
Lost in a promised land milking honey's
A field of dreams, this the city of angel
Set your neck on the line, that shit'll get strangled
What you expect? Besides connected, the culdesac counsil
Starter jackets, and Sauconys, the sauce in me
And a sordid past
Fresh from court, no boarding pass
Pour more with a taller glass
Monetary support towards some college class
A wealth of knowledge, hustle mania
Game became placed to make with power
Sitting on the stoop like a substitute, solid
Chopping it with the barbers displacing transplanted
Sipping a chalice in childish comfort
The colors got colored improper
Shuffling shuckers, cool suckers, cards for audit[Hook: Mibbs]
Hanging with the posse, haters wanna copy
Mad cause I'm young, fly and making that broccoli
Hanging with the posse, haters wanna copy
Mad cause I'm young, fly and making that broccoli
Hanging with the posse, haters wanna copy
Mad cause I'm young, fly and making that broccoli
Hanging with the posse, haters wanna copy
Mad cause I'm young, fly and making that broccoli

[Verse 1: BeYoung]
Four-four speed
High high up, but no nose bleed
It's the finest of colognes, girls grinding to our songs
Get your bra wet before she jottin' down her phone
Number, don't wonder
All day, Parkay, so butter
LeBron James Hall of Fame numbers, closet game thunderous
Big head before the U.S. changed hundreds
Been there, done it, done it cause I been there
Show up at the front door, yeah they let me in there
No rain, no chain, how them niggas get there?
Said she went to work dog, how I get your bitch here? (That broccoli)

[Hook: Mibbs]

[Verse 2: Like]
Uh, green Ferragamos, mean pair of models
Ballin' like Kareem with a clean pair of goggles
She used to hate me, now she wanna swallow
We don't just push, we put that thing to the throttle
Please hold your bravos, three is the combo
The whole enchilada with the cheese on the tacos
Please get the nachos, we are the honchos
'Bout to rain on you all we need is some ponchos
We get broccoli so easy, just blindfold us
Hoes didn't wanna ride, now they ride for us
Haters wanna look now, got their eyes on us
I'm through talking, roll up, I got 5 on it

[Hook: Mibbs]

[Verse 3: Mibbs]
Big Mibbs (What up?), knuckle up, buttercups
Pac Div huddled up, they running out of luck
While you jumps double dutch, I'll be cutting up a thin waist
With a bubble butt, that don't wanna cuddle up
I don't show no affection, cause she know my direction
And I guess it's only right for her to know my erection
I'm a pro by selection, the goal is perfection
My show is like catching Derrick Rose as a freshman
Behold, I'm a legend, and along with my bretheren
We make songs like a messenger bestowed us from heaven
The best in the western hemisphere, engineer greatness
Now how you gonna sit up there and hate this?

[Hook: Mibbs][Hook]

Yeah! We gon' pour up some more
Yeah! We gon' pour up some more
Yeah! We gon' pour up some more

Oh fosho' couple hoes comin' over
Pretty things with they hair to they shoulders
They done drove all the way from Pomona
Get the Cognac or green or Coronas
And they on us, and I'm on one
First base, Nah I go for the homerun
And she gon' come and she gon' leave
Cause he going to sleep
Said up jump the boogy the bang the beat
Now see y'all jump (??) cuz I made the beat

Baby don't hog the Yak if you hang with me
We put in, Oh you thinking you drink for free?
Said that you heavyweight but you can't compete
And when we waking up we hang.. (??)
The way I run my game it's from A to Z
And if you start to go you can play the scene

[Hook]
Yeah! We gon' pour up some more
Yeah! We gon' pour up some more

Who said broke niggas can have no fun
I had the best time ever when I had no funds
Got that kush rolled up, a bottle of rum
And a couple cute girls, that‚Äôs how it all begun
Next morning when I woke up
I forgot me and what‚Äôs-her-face broke up
We on the phone and she sounding all choked up
All that crying had her pillow case soaked up
Telling me she wished we never broke up
In the back of my mind, I'm like so what
She said Mike, why you so fucked up
I said what you talking bout, she hung up
Damn, and guess who is laying next to me
Yeah, it‚Äôs her home girl, Destiny
I can't believed she came here and tested me

(Chorus)
For chaos this is the recipe (x3)
Ain‚Äôt no telling what the side effects could be?
For chaos this is the recipe (Say It) (x3)
Ain‚Äôt no telling what the side effects could be? (Say It)
For chaos this is the recipe

(Like)
Disaster, we cooking in so many ways
The recipe is written all over her face
Speeding through life without knowing the pace
Hey, baby slow down, take a moment embrace
She says there‚Äôs bills to be payed
Her son got to eat
Her baby dad helpless
He runs in the streets
Her job layed her off
Her mom ain't involved
The walls closing in
She lost faith in God
Next afternoon, she sitting home (sitting home)
Tears on her on face, she sits alone (she sits alone)
Gun on the table, she grips the chrome (she grips the chrome)
Raise her to her temple, she‚Äôs gone

(Chorus)
For chaos this is the recipe (x2) (I‚Äôm warning you)
Ain‚Äôt no telling what the side effects would be? (I‚Äôm warning you)
For chaos this is the recipe (Say It) (x3) (I‚Äôm warning you)
Ain‚Äôt no telling what the side effects could be? (I‚Äôm warning you)
For chaos this is the recipe (I‚Äôm warning you)

(Be Young)
I hit the store with my home boy Baby D
I had to grab a brew, grabbed a few thangs to eat
As always, keep it cool do my thang in peace
Watch these motherfuckers, still trynna bang they street
Naw, I‚Äôm a man but understand that ain‚Äôt the plight G
I came for the swishers, came for the Ice T
They hit me up about that Dodgers hat right D
I said shit you know, Manny had a nice week
Aim for the bull, I‚Äôm just out here trying to do me
Niggas got to find away to fight away through the beef
Plus I think my cousin san cool with your peeps
All my niggas caught in chaos through the streets

(Chorus)
For chaos this is the recipe (x2) (I‚Äôm warning you)
Ain‚Äôt no telling what the side effects would be? (I‚Äôm warning you)
For chaos this is the recipe (Say It) (x3) (I‚Äôm warning you)

(Outro)
I‚Äôm warning you[Hook]
I got my cross-trainers on, motherfucker, I run shit
All I do is rap, make dough for the dumb shit
The return of that 808 trunk hit
Cash in my palm, I'mma pass the baton, GO!
Cross trainers on my motherfuckin' feet (go!)
Cross trainers on my motherfuckin' feet (go!)
Cross trainers on my motherfuckin' feet
Cash in my palm, I'mma pass the baton

You be on that fuck shit, I'm tryin' to make bucks quick
Don't talk to me if money ain't the subject
93's laced up, we about to run shit
Mibbs right beside me, BeYoung got the blunt lit
Shawn on the cut, Swiff D on the drum kits
Standin' on your table with a bottle and a drunk bitch
Fallin' all over spillin' drinks, tryin' to tongue kiss
Money over hoes, so you know I ain't the one, Miss
Take her home, make her moan, and when I get done: (Switch!)
Pass her off like a basketball
Stay with dimes, I'm like Nash to y'all
My living room look like a casting call
Don't be bringing hoes with Noassatall
A sweet talkin' nigga, ask your mom
My nigga, that's your squad?
We treat line-ups like that's Lebron
Push backwards like the bush whackers
We ain't just kush rappers - we max it out like FootAction

[Hook]

[Verse 2: BeYoung]
Nigga hand over fist, bring some cash in this bitch
Y'all niggas picture near puttin' swag in your spliffs
My niggas cop the 7 just to laugh at the 6
Like "nigga, do you know how much ass I'mma get?"
Wrote a plan out, let's dip, we can market and sing
Put that cash in a stash, save that part for the rent
Only way niggas swingin' is to target the fence
That's why everything we're singing hit the target like Prince, man
I'm talkin' vanity and "Can it be?"'s
Stickin' to the strategy, how simple can it be?
Niggas comin' home we gon' put them on the salary
Niggas think they cold 'til we push our shit to Calgary

[Verse 3: Blu]
Yea, you're who-blah and your shoe rot
You're too shy to be Rah Rah, your due ska
You're new job from Calgary to the new spot
Threw that 2pac on, but couldn't ride like we used 'ta
Used up, you're new guy's shoe size
Drew ties, never move pies move lines
She do lines why we shoot rhymes, shoo fly
Don't bother the father, just let me do mine

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Mibbs]
It's notorious, peep it
Y'all niggas is Victoria's Secret
Soft as Mom's lingerie
It's a man's world boy, put the pom-poms away
It's only right we got our palms on LA
Cause if Pac was alive, you'd get bombed on today
Bombs bombs away, like 'Bron 'Bron and Wade
We been had next, now it's our time to play, nigga

[Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar]
Your false prophets will never jump in my pockets
You're poppin' your gums and I'm poppin' your optics
Optimus Prime when I'm done
And the topic of music is me
And the logic is usually
You should stop in and grab a degree
In the science of how to emcee
And I'm watchin' the critics critique
When I'm climbing the valleys and peaks
And aligning myself
While I'm riding Orion's belt
In the street and defiling this beat
As a dead bitch that lay at my feet
This is King shit...

[Hook][Hook:]
Put some rozey in my cup
And put Scoop on that beat
Yeah my posse in the cut
And we roll up 4-5 deep
We up early in the morning
Finna get it while you sleep
It's my time that's beast mode
That's red bow, that's Debo

That's MJ with a fade away
Debo getting paid today
Fuck me you gon' fuck the team
Low pimp game never played today
Shit highschool ride that tape bouffet
Any pics I wave the way
Now I go down more aid await
Could get a pretty bitch out amazing grace
Should I AVH y'all rapper wrong
Niggas be know what papi on
Raised by niggas with khakis on
Alibi sweet acting home
In that carlo racid my chaperone
Patch hoes like Hasselhoff
Up in the morning I'm smashing off
Beastmode might smoke till my stash is gone

[Hook]

I be goddamned if a nigga ever tried to take my bitch
Cause I'mma be goddamned if I gotta drive out and dig a ditch
And I be goddamned if one of his homeboys go snitch
Cause I'mma be goddamned if I gotta drive out and dig a ditch
That's grind time, that's beast mode
That's Rambo, that's Debo, I'm in camo, fleece mode
Stop geeking these street clothes
Ya'll fucking them weak hoes, them freak hoes that don't do shit
Take pictures on instagram, act like they doin' shit
Niggas install my flow that's cool I'm that nigga
Oh girl got ass with it, shoebox got cash in it
My snapback got naps in it, tattoos and black denim
Wack niggas can't rap with us
Pac Div on cash girl

[Hook]

That's how we on it no smiling on it
No styling on it beast baby
I'm growling on it
Don't nobody want it, put a thousand on it
Stacks homie
I'm laying back and I'm reclining
My feet is up their seats is up
My throw aways they sweep 'em up
Niggas talk alot don't read enough
I got a couple questions that I will ask you
How your swag futuristic but your bills past due
Boy I'm in grinding gimme mine
Zoom a patch like the Emmy 5
Bisniss time, I'm worried about me
I'm getting mine, getting lime
Whether pimpin hoes or flipping ozies
It's really ain't no difference homie
We all got dreams of coups
But please don't pigeon homie
Do Nickleodeon these niggas own me
I'm a different breed in a different league
In a different speed
Guess that's why your bitch flew we

(Verse)
Yeah Killa Cali, up top like a nigga Fowley playin park ball
Something like a young Nate Archibald
Lower than my arts draws like Warhols, ugly like warhogs
We gather round sports bars and court yards
Lookin for Double D‚Äôs like that report cards
She lookin for millionaires with sports cars
She end up with broke niggas and porn stars
School never meant much, I rather kick rhymes and count big bucks
Rather hit dames who got big butts
Rather get miles, we just live once, why not get it?
These labels are in business to get bucks
Moral of the story ‚Äì don‚Äôt get fucked
With the right to impress yo mind
We gotta cut it short, look I‚Äôm pressin time

(Verse)
Said I always been a man plus none of my girls had the flat ass
They let the Jim Carrey battem like my ass
I‚Äôm a permanent stain up on yo brain
That made up love supreme, no John Coltrane
Saluting to lieutenant, I play the earth wind and fire
Minus the water, call me Captain Planet
Creator of the earth and the giver of rain
I strike thunder in yo lightning, nigga watch what you say
Pray to Allah
I can‚Äôt even begin this, setting D‚Äôs, I hope you‚Äôre taping this
Minus Mariah, fucking bitches snap turn at this age
Born in that dirty South, and the flies that we put in don‚Äôt believe that you atheist

[BLU]
Uh ayo, wutchu call God on a rap?
Wu Tang laid in the shade like head tracks, toupe
Kool Aid, potter in the pound
Something wrong? Young tune hung like drugs, lunch
Peak on rewind sunshine, ganja
Mind in front of the yall probably
Legals in space bar, hot technology
Got 80 babies on that Viacom, stop me
Even rain goes to ride, come tsunamis
Blue beach, I get in the mist, karate
Chop beats meets the aki
Not needs, blocks like keys but we unlock these
Buy lean, how could you say that we not G?
Weight of the world on these shoulders, spot me

(Verse)
Parallel parking, no power steering
Clearing, air it and there in a bang in a spot
Dreaming like I‚Äôm Captain Kirk, wuddup Scott, ock?
Guess I‚Äôm hard but layin, killin birds got mocked, rock
With a cold heart, result to blancos
See bank roll s through peep holes
Peep in time, no pesos, pay roll turns me on
Like a born hop sluts, spatulation talk with nuts
Dick up in a rent pipe, ass right, cheech right
So what it is? Tryna live what like this
Minus bitch nigga that go like they made from a rig

(Hook)
My nigga gotta live, my nigga gotta live
My nigga gotta live, my nigga gotta live

(Verse)
You can‚Äôt talk slick to a can of oil
You can‚Äôt talk fly shit to a falcon
You lookin sad Mike, you‚Äôre so cool
I say you‚Äôre damn right, bitch buy my album
Throw a nigga on the blog and I rock thousands
Yea nigga on the job and I‚Äôm not countin
Zoomin up, I‚Äôm with the emblem with the black stallion
Got these bitches and I‚Äôm in the middle like Malcolm
Triple X rated, we from the west baby
Today I‚Äôm getting high, homie I‚Äôm frustrated
Cuz I want success, I guess I‚Äôm just anxious
It‚Äôs always on my mind, I feel like a fuckin rapist

(Verse)
I aspire to be iconic
And it‚Äôs ironic how I can‚Äôt get out a pocket like your wallet
In my city with no college and I fit it, feelin like I hit a Philly really high
Not really, but kinda like it though
Five Michael flow, peace to Weezy out of rykers
But I‚Äôm writin for them lifers that unlike me had a writer‚Äôs block
For lack of an Iverson cross so maybe guidance talkin to em
In that lightin which I‚Äôm walkin to, I kick that
You call it science lyin like I ain‚Äôt applyin
This shit like religion, listen niggas tuck on the pivot
I‚Äôm shootin and hittin every shot, and I ain‚Äôt even hotchis
Sizzling shit get fizzling bitch

(Verse)
I roller skate backwards, sick like cancer
Dirty rat bastard, bow to the master
Take take take it, if you want it I‚Äôll give it
I‚Äôll kill it for the sure man, come get with it

(Verse)
Pike up the bong, bang a gong, get it on
Lend a list lumps for the chumps get gone
Aggressive, so what may seem wrong
It‚Äôs major, hit the sky high wave pager
Lowlife poster, hash is my ashtray
Roll stiff, west coast shit, let‚Äôs toast it
Feelin ferocious, just my wife
The bug, to right, excites the low light
Guess who, that guy is in
Like eggs on grits bitch ask a friend
You smoking serves gangs with a 3rd brain
Race palms hard is the main thing

(Verse)
I break bread,ribs
100$ bills, peel out buckets with the datings for the wheels
The block get hard, niggas bangin' like Shaquille
Them fishy ass niggas, we just shake em from the real
Slake em when we bill wipe
Thinkin with the mill, my niggas at the table
But you fake it and you squeal
Now shake it with the broad, it‚Äôs just Jason in the thrill
A southern Cal nigga but my fragrance from Brazil, steel
Catch me out in Austin with the Texas toast
Them thick white girls get ahead in vote
It was written we was leavin with the freshest quotes
Gotta live, we get it off the chest and go
Go go go

(Verse)
Let me go let me go let me go let me go let me go
But I open the door
Don‚Äôt put it on should an old nigga go nigga go
But I‚Äôm all for the coast
Hope that it both to the floor bout the time you reach to die
You look in her eyes frozen safe, we should dive now
What will it be? What would it be? Wake up
Bitch I feel what could it be?
My shoe size fuckin huge, now could it be him?
Better head back to the beehive
We died and get return now
Believe these creeps please feel quicker than you work how
We could leave no bird trail, no fingerprints, no perfume
You can‚Äôt compare to the debonair
That we better dug, dog cover that
Country got no challenges, I don‚Äôt even know bout child niggas
Now we smoke for all the whip up
Please excuse these amatures[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]

Hands Up, Hands Up, damn this is our Anthem
All these hoes is on the scene like, "Damn this niggas handsome"
First I had to be reserved but now I can just grab one

She be sayin "Take me out," I be playin "Take Me Down"

All these kids ain't cool to me, but you can hate on Mikey now
Fuck Soulja Boy, Dog I heard that shit at Ice-T's house

Tryin to get my cake right, maybe bring the icin out
That mean you gone hate right? Make me bring the Tyson out
When I'm in the buildin nigga make sure all the lights is out
Dom gone shine by any means, they say he's the nicest out
Best car, nicest house, all that shit they writin about

Maybach's, Phantom's, Damn these is our anthem
I used to look up to stars, but Dog now that I am one
I used to want a lot of hoes, but now bitch I can't stand one
I used to like to go to shows, but now shit I can jam one like

[Verse 2: Mibbs]

Take ya hands and put em to the sky
Do what I say girl don't ask me why

Niggas say Like you gone always be cool
Even if you in a Bucket or Brand New Ride

[Verse 3: Like]

Ah, Yes Sir, We on fire
All a nigga need is weed and lighter
Tell that bitch chill or we [?]
Spark the Kush up, then we get higher

Send her home to you, we didn't wife her

[Verse 4: BeYoung]

Oh No Emergency
BeYoung if ya heard of me
You know I spit that third degree
Hop inside and come skert with me
Don't pay attention to the absurdest things

Girl so sad now a turned out freak
She mad cause we permed that weave

[Verse 5: Carter]

They wanna wait and see, they hatin me
Shit feels great to me (uh huh)
I'm in the place to be
Bum as niggas can't relate wit me
None of them niggas try and take the Steez
Kill they careers, Shit enough about them
They wanna hear more about him
Goldman's Warren, you can ask him
Bobby, Ben, you can ask them
Ibn Jasper, ask him too
If I'm a need to know or who's who
If a chick had to pick bet it's me she'd choose
Born winner, Them no lose
The day I stop, I'll still resume
Born to ride, better check my resume
I'm more Diddy, I'm no Loon
Clown as niggas got me amused
Hatin ass Hoes got me confused
Talk em down, what's a nigga to do
(Got everything to do with the band my nigga)
All I know, All I know
Is help myself, didn't help my folks
Everything new, can't tell me bro
Shine so hard bet I got them low
Hotel late now I sell that smoke
I didn't at first now inhale that smoke
I let my mamma down, damn I know, I know
But a nigga got to let go
She so stoked, bought my CD
Tellin me she love everything he wrote
But a nigga didn't write shit (shit)
Guess he just got that gift (shit)
Curse come with it, kill em with the flow
Niggas better hope that a hearse come with it
Get on a song with me? Please (Naw)
Niggas ain't flowin with me? Please (Naw)
Look it's all on me I can't help but believe
All work no sleep I ain't got no dreams
Now cheap talk, kill it
I'm in the game full court jump the sideline chillin
Come out that "H" that's why I'm Grillin (H-Town)
Watch a nigga take it to the carpet to the ceilin
Everywhere I go I'm the livest in the buildin
All the money in the world couldn't buy that feelin (Never)
Couldn't buy that feelin (Naw)
Try to buy that feelin
Everywhere I go I'm the livest in the buildin
All the money in the world couldn't buy that feelin

Cloud 9 and I ain't coming down
Real booty like this don't come around
Look into your eyes, through your Dior frames
Lets flow high like when you board planes
My boys look at me all strange
They like "What this nigga Like on?!"
Up late night staring at your icon
Photo on your blog site pondering the thought like
I'm the one your type baby, I can be your icon, shit
Baby I can be your side kick
You can be my main thing, I think you're the right fit

I'm about to call her up
Cause she's so gorgeous, that ass is so enormous
I promise I won't fall in love, with this pussy
Wine and a little bit of time is all it took me
Now I'm knee deep in it, so much I can sleep in it
So good, I think I might skeet skeet in it
Oh, shit there goes my conscience
I get this picture in my head of me falling
She got me calling, fuck it I did
Babe, you left your lip-gloss back at my crib
I'm at the studio now be back at 10
She right on time, we back at it again, like...

[Verse 3: BeYoung]

I'll love to take you down on your lunch break
Hit the Fallopian, your ex is a crumbcake
Hes Nickelodeon you know I'm on my main shit
Up at the podium you always give the brain right
Call you Smithsonian, we're homies and we're intimate
How she get me in the mix track star backyard, cake like intimate
Smoking like an Indian, you're raised off Phillipians
You know it's real when she makes sure the rent is in
Yeah, at first I'd rather be your nigga
Time goes fast and our vibes move quicker
Couldn't wait a while, kinda crazy
How I grew with ya?
With the world finna do with us

I know we wasn't what you looking for
But when you see us its like how much is y'all booking for
Guess we ain't turn out as corny as you took us for
You probably want us begging pennies out the liquor store
Its been a long time, feel like a slow grind
But sure enough the label stumbled on this gold mine
Was either that or sit up in the unemployed line
Now we on and everybody want a joy ride
Damn homie, you told me don't rhyme
You see a nigga in the magazine you cosign
You say we too soft
We tell you screw off
We'll pick that Grammy up in no time

[Hook]
I feel like I need to be congratulated
For all the bullshit that I've been through
It feels good knowing that you hate it
Thats why I wrote this song for you
For you, For you,For you,For you
Thats why I wrote this song for you
For you, For you,For you,For you
Thats why I wrote this song

[Verse 2: Mibbs]
Guess what I did? (whats that?)
I told my boss I quit
When my check comes you better have my shit (Ooo!)
I stood atop my desk blew the officer kisses
Told Bret from accounting you can suck my dick
Congratulations, thats right people, yes I did
Waited my whole life for a day like this
So next time you see me I'll be on my shit
I got a whole lot of folks to scribble off my list
Like hoes that did me wrong
Niggas that dissed my songs
And other miscellaneous shit I don't condone
In the Hollywood zone where everybody's a clone
Pac Div stands alone, Its on!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: BeYoung]
Congratulations I heard you got a new man and county job
Still at your parents house plus you drive his Audi car
Went from K-Mart to Vicky Secret catalogs
V.I.P. everywhere you go the cameras are. Yup
I heard you treat the market like the red carpet
Next to the eggs and the high heels with your hair parted
Polluted minds just die getting fed garbage
You take pride and drive niggas off the edge darling
And yet still we ain't mad at ya
Its clear to see that your ass backwards
Auctioned off when these niggas throw their cash at you
Yor brain gone, but your ass fatter

No hype, we ain't matchin' numbers that's our old price
Cash, check, yeah scrilla
Got the strength of 10 niggas
Yeah I'm cool but them niggas is some weird pillars
In the hood to the white boys with Quiksilver
Out the park with the shit I think I'm Prince Fielder

You feed em it really means nothin' dog
These niggas awfully and lawful
They breakin' inside yo' crib
It just means they probably gon' rob you
They actin' holy in public but far from part the Apostle
Abusin' the constituion and quit to carve up the Gospel dog
The laws (?) supposed to be talkin' bout bitches and weed
Money and bling those sort of things ya know?
Yeah it seems to be what's in

Diplomatic immunity on the dick

Innocent, opposite, in to get it, all of it

Your chick come around, I'mma cut her like a DJ
Cool out man, whatchu 'bout, man?
We from the rest where they pull out things that go "BANG"

Asher Roth:
We're Getting Hellafaded (4x)

Pac Div:
Gimme that watch, gimme that ring, and whatever else you lean
It's that 2-11 music bitch you know what I mean
And if you ever come to my city you know what my team, is
Willy, Magic, Kareem, Byron Scott on the wing, man
I'm clean, I'm shinin', I sparkle like a diamond
Been running this for years, man, I should win the Heisman
She love it, she like, she said I am the flyest
So she put it in again any time I'd like to ride it

Asher Roth:
We're Getting Hellafaded (4x)

Pac Div:
It's getting, It's getting, It's getting kinda nasty
One blunt rolled up, the other where my stash be
In the game, something like Milton Bradley
Old school nigga, man I still roll up black street
We go back like hot wheel tracks
In the box heels back, bring that Pac feel back
Fuck around, get your top peeled back
Niggas drop real rap we don't want none of that

Asher Roth:
We're Getting Hellafaded (4x)

Asher Roth:
First off Ash Roth says fuck the game
I've been a bum for a month and I still ain't changed
I got clothes with some holes and they still all stained
But I will show up to your show and I steal the stage
Yeah the crowd getting buck like they couldn't get enough
Everybody in the front do the guido fist pump
I be humpin' on a bum, she got junk up in the trunk
Like I met her in Miami hanging on the bang bus
I be playing in them panties like my man Brain does
And they kick it to the corner right when the brain done
They be calling up my celly (cell phone) I just fucking hang up
I be wifin' up a muffin you just went and gave it up
I'm young, I'm straight, I'll wait, not done
Put your titties in my face, play the nipple with my tongue
It's my favorite instrument, I like to practice with the drums
So pour up a shot of remmy and roll up another blunt![Hook]
This is all my love
This is all my hope
This is all my pain
This is all my growth
These are all my highs
These are all my lows
This is all my heart
Cause this is all I know
So here we go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Here we go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

[Verse 1]
I will never forget, I was six years old
Pops said stand up, you're a man be bold
The world wants your soul, it's just that cold
Stay close to God, and you gon' reach your goals
This is what I was told, so I took it and ran
Headed out on the road, it was part of the plan
Started out as a child, grew up to a man
Saw the journey was rough, now I understand
The reason I can't keep steady relationships
The reason I can't sleep, I stay awake for this
Up late for this, I got faith in this
Shit I pray for this
I was made for this

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Before your career was imagined
You can reach the sky, when your money gets low
Still your dreams got caught
A lot of folks gon' hate, don't know reasons why
But that motivation is what keep dreams alive
I was ten years old, started writing my rhymes
Whole world in front of me staring right in my eyes
Years passsed, middle of ways, tryna survive
Yeah we feel so much stress it's like the life of the line
These are triflin' times, who knew the life was in blind
He's in the streets trying to steal your soul right when you sign
Your enemies tryna throw you shade right when you shine
Visually I'mma take what is rightfully mine

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You know work in the morning, Xbox got me up late
Just heard that they sent the homie upstate
Caught another tough break, we used to have class together
Behind bars now we can't plays the Sac together
Flashback remember Hoops outta hangers Georgetown
Blew for the Bangers
Feel like the world ain't understanding me
Tryna hold door to my sanity
Every person fifteen had to make a man in me
Had to paint the path for me
No baby mom naggin' me
Ain't a such thing as you ain't got it when you have a seat
Tryna pass in peace, we tryna stay strong
It's real life ain't no uniform

[Hook]

[2Pac]
They'll never take me alive
I'm gettin' high with my four-five
Cocked on these suckas, time to die
Even as a youngster causin' ruckus on the back of the bus
I was a fool all through high school kickin' up dust
But now I'm labelled as a trouble maker, who can you blame?
Smokin' weed helped me take away the pain
So I'm hopeless
Rollin' down the freeway swervin, don't worry
I'm about to crash up on the curb, cause my visions blurry
Maybe if they tried to understand me
What should I do?
I had to feed my fuckin' family
What else could I do?
But be a thug
Out slangin' with the homies
Fuck hangin' with them phonies in the clubs
Got my mind on danger
Never been a stranger to homicide
My city's full of gang bangers and drive-bys
Why do we die at an early age?
He was so young
But still a victim of the 12 gauge
My memories of a corpse
Mind full of sick thoughts
And I ain't goin' back to court
So fuck what you thought
I'm drinkin' Hennessy
Runnin from my enemies
Will I live to be 23?
There's so much pain[Intro]
