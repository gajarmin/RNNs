[Verse 1: Vince Staples]
Take your time, when talkin' to a nigga I don't waste none
Knock you off your feet and then I flee before the jakes come
Sick of hearin' cases from these niggas who ain't face none
But I'ma be the nigga that they feelin' when the day come
Thirsty for the pay, young niggas led astray
Stray bullet hit my brother in his mothafuckin' face
What's fate when a person don't deserve what he get?
Shootin' reckless at the father almost murdered the kid
Or is it karma for the shit that both the parents had did?
Ain't embarrassed where I'm livin', we get merit for kills
From a family of niggas that was veteran skilled
Voted heartless cause my momma made me part of the guild
Deals made, sellin' thrills paid the bills at the crib
Drag him down by the river, he'll be missin' for years
And them funerals was usual, ain't sheddin' no tears
You could fall and have it better off than most of us did
Cause shit, Heaven knows, Heaven's gates prolly closed
And these hoes in a race for the gold
We was raised on that fork in the road
No food on our plate, just the meals that we stole

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I spit that prayer hand emoji, that shit that injured Kobe
The holiest of holy, Nick Nolte in some Oakley's
That's a flex though, cover up the issues that I kept close
Sober I can't deal I'm in the corner with my head low
Runnin' from my shadow, never ending chase
Ease the pain and the battle that's within me
Sniff the same shit that got Whitney, the high heel depression
My temple feel the metal comin' out the Smith & Wesson, bang
Say a prayer, leave my brains on the tile floor
My bitch hate me, always tell me I should smile more
Off them drugs that hit you in your spinal cord
This the shit I need to keep the climate warm
Wish I could get high, space migration
Pretend I can just fly to great vibrations
The magazines need a quote
Now I'm gone, sorry I don't even know

[Outro: Mac Miller]
And this pain, and this pain, and this pain, and this pain
Mixed up with this rain, this rain, this rain, this rain[Produced by 9th Wonder]

[Intro: Cedric the Entertainer]
Yo , what's up, pimp, this Threats
That's right, that's the - the that's, this Threats, pimp
And I'm serious about mine, I'm so sin-surr
And I, nigga I'll kill ya, I'll chop ya up
Put ya inside the mattress like drug money nigga

[Jay-Z]
Yeah, I done told you niggas

The 9 on me, stop fuckin with me
You niggas must got 9 lives
9th wonder

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Put that knife in ya, take a little bit of life from ya
Am I frightenin ya? Shall I continue?
I put the gun to ya, I let it sing you a song
I let it hum to ya, the other one sing along
Now it's a duet, and you wet, when you check out
The technique from the 2 Tecs and I don't need two lips
To blow this like a trumpet you dumb shit
This is a unusual musical, I conductin
You lookin at the black Warren Buffett so all critics can duck sic
I don't care if you C. Delores Tuck-it
Or you Bill O'Reilly, you only rilin me up
For three years, they had me peein' out of a cup
Now they bout to free me up, whatchu think I'm gon' be, what?
Rehabilitated, man I still feel hatred
I'm young, black and rich so they wanna strip me naked, but
You never had me like Christina Aguiler-y
But catch me down the Westside, drivin like Halle Berry
Or the FDR, in the seat of my car
Screamin out the sunroof "death to y'all"
You can't kill me, I live forever through these bars
I put the wolves on ya, I put a price on your head
The whole hood'll want ya, you startin to look like bread
I send them boys at ya, I ain't talkin bout Feds
Nigga, them body-snatchers, nigga you heard what I said

[Hook]
I make 'em wait for you 'til five in the mornin
Put your smarts on the side of your garment
Nigga stop fuckin with me
R ... I ... P

[Interlude: Cedric the Entertainer]
That's right there nigga, nigga I'm wild
Nigga I keep trash bags with me
Never know when you gotta dump a nigga out
This sin-surr, this some sin-surr SHIT right hurr!

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Grown man I put hands on you
I dig a hole in the desert, they build the Sands on you
Lay out blueprint plans on you
We Rat Pack niggas, let Sam tap dance on you
Then, I Sinatra shot ya God damn you
... I put the boy in the box like David Blaine
Let the audience watch, it ain't a thang
Y'all wish I was frontin, I George Bush the button
For the oil in your car lift up your hood nigga run it
Then lift up your whole hood like you got oil under it
Your boy got the goods y'all don't want nuttin of it
Like, castor oil, I'a Castor Troy you
Change your face or the bullets change all that for you
... y'all niggas is targets
Y'all garages for bullets, please don't make me park it
In your upper level, valet a couple strays
From the .38 Special, nigga, God bless you

[Hook]

[Interlude: Cedric the Entertainer]
Yeah I'm threatening ya, YEAH I'm threatening ya!
Who you thank you dealin with?
They call me Threats, nigga I been makin threats
Since I been in kindergarten nigga!
Huh, ask about me, see if you ain't heard

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
When the gun is tucked, untucked, nigga you dies
Like nunchuks held by the Jet L-I
I'm the one, thus meanin no one must try
No two, no three, no four, know why?
Because one's four-five might blow yo' high
You ain't gotta go to church to get to know yo' God
It's a match made in heaven when I {*silencer shot*} 'splay the 7
Put you on the nigga news, UPN and 11
Where you been, you ain't heard, got the word that I'm
[Two silencer shots] that I'm so sin-surr?
I'm especially Joe Pesci wit it, friend
I will kill you, commit suicide, and kill you again
That's right

[Hook]

[Outro: Cedric the Entertainer]
Whatup? Motherfucker I keep three motherfuckers what?
Nigga I'll throw a Molotov cocktail through your momma's momma's house
Nigga what the - where everybody live!
Undercover nigga take your teeth out your mouth nigga
Chew your food up and put the shit back in your mouth nigga
And help you swallow
Nigga I take a mop handle off nigga
And sweep nigga - hold on, I'll be - nigga what?[Produced by 9th Wonder]

[Verse]
It's when you walk out on faith
Choose to do what feel right, let everyone else trace
What we chase ain't the same
I'm still that rapper that your favorite rapper scared to rap after
Sometimes it's hard to chill, choose to kill, kill, kill, kill
I'm just that good though I ain't worth a lot of millions
When you rap this well a lot of rappers catch feelings
We all want the best, don't let a female kill 'em, yeah
Hard to choose culture over fame
You just want to be set and take care of all your fame
It don't make you, but it be cool to have money like Wayne
Take the shorter roads so the family ain't worrying
Chose to build it slow, ain't no need, no hurrying
It's hard to be political, can't say what's on your brain
Careers come quick, it's just as fast to bury 'em
But I chose to give a damn
And box for you like pictures on Instagram
Chose to respect what was built by both Kool and Bam
You know who I am, word to my homie Wyann
Shit, ain't hard to choose me there's only one me, man
(So hard to choose)
That's why I chose to be that
Because where I'm from it ain't cool to be wack
And I'm so pro-black
Though they don't choose me back and that's some choosy shit
Why it's so hard to choose y'all over these jewels and whips
Welcome to my side
When you look in the crowd the minority's never white
I appreciate y'all, but I'm lying if it don't bite
Cause I love all races but we gotta raise 'em
Cause I know the scale tipped ain't in no black girl's favor
Hey y'all, we all outcasts, these black girls favor
The blonde Barbie and scars, we all gotta save 'em
No love lost for whites, Latinos and the Asians
Loyal to all, but when I look at these black girls faces
I understand why I chose to be better, not basic
So it's not, not (hard to choose)
Yeah, so excuse if I don't care if hipsters relate
It weren't for you at all, at all why these songs were made
Like you were overlaid at the airport
And missed your sort of take off
Don't understand why we get naked or
Why it's hard to choose being real or being fake, huh?
Cause the world worship people that get their cake up
But I chose to De La Soul and raise the stake up
Now why is it (so hard to choose)?
Yeah, seldom support our own, I helped myself by advancement
Want to make sure our daughters have better chances
But y'all in that show and watching videos
Why it's hard to choose class or let them titties show
But it's better for my heart, honey, like Cheerios
And secondly more comfortable doing [?]
Trying to build you up like I went to Lowe's and bought a lot
MC Lyte, I ain't forgot what you told me
I ain't Hovy, but damn
It's hard to choose being humble or going HAM
Humility's a weakness, I was told different
Quietest in the room is the baddest one like Durant
It's hard to choose Carolina over Atlanta
Chicago, LA, especially in Johannesburg
Yeah, cause it's been love since beginnin'
Home away from home, versus homes we get no spins in
Why it's (so hard to choose)?
Being super lyrical or slowing it down
Will they understand the metaphors and how they compound
With the two lines before and the next three after?
And ask myself does this shit, if it even still matter?
The joints y'all tripping on are so easy and average
And the ones I respect all got that gift mastered
I don't want to compromise my sick self for a master
But it's (so, so hard to choose)
Cause if I don't I'm not cool and I'm boring
Should add a tsch tsch to my beats to be current
This the shit I think about along with image and earnings
But when Nas tell me "God you killin' it" then I'm burning
All thoughts chasing y'all, man, it's easy now
XXL ain't tripping, Time calmed me down
Thinking where we all started from and where we all sitting now
Shit I see it different now, why it's not, not (hard to choose)[Produced by 9th Wonder]

[Sample]
When all dreams seem to die
The summer's gone, the breeze stops blowing
The sun just leaves the sky

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Uh
Yeah, this your life, you can play with it
You make your bed, you gon' lay in it
Do your thing, just be safe with it
Triple bunks in the state prison
Blue laces in my blue chucks
I ain't never gave two fucks
BET I chucked the hood up
Asking if that nigga Nip hood, what
Like I wouldn't take it to the back with you
Same nigga walk the track with you
Same nigga shot a strap with you
Same nigga bought a sack with you
Nineteen touchin' two birds
Alpinas off a few swerves
Grey leather in my white Lincoln
Shit smellin' like a new purse
Two C's on my bitch shit
My money risin' like Bisquick
Six words help you get this
Rich Rapper On Some Crip Shit
I prayed for blessings as a young nigga
Not to learn the hard lessons of a drug dealer
Triple life with a gang enhancement
The judge triple white and he hate your blackness
Slam the gavel with a racist passion
Got you waitin' on appeals but your patience passin'
All you've got to offer is a fight
It's too late to run to Christ once you caught up in this life
Look

[Hook]
So face the world now or cry

[Verse 2]
Look
Don't cry tears, they don't fly here
And if you don't die here, you supposed to fly lears
365 here is like a dog year
No wonder why these niggas 20 and got white hairs
Stressin' like they 40 and some change
It's lonely in this game, all my homies is in pain
And brodie is the slang, but it don't mean he your brother
It don't mean you can trust him, it don't mean that he love you
And we was raised wrong but we stayed strong
And when we kept it real, we got faked on
And when we showed up, we got flaked on
While them niggas story's gettin' cake holmes
I bet my life I'm a dice shaker
Electric lights on a skyscraper
Was up and downs for a real nigga
But you'll be lame all your life, hater
Mac-10 in my black Benz
Show me signals of betrayal, can't be back friends
Long flights get my mind right
Victory to me is when you spend your time right
Victory to me is when you get your grind right
Victory to me is when you get your moms right
Niggas, got this shit twisted
Like Jean-Michel Basquiat destroyed his pictures
Self-inflicted homicide, don't pull the trigger
I feel like I got to tell you you got something to contribute
Regardless what you into, regardless what you been through
I feel like I got to tell you you got something to contribute
Something to contribute

[Hook][Produced by 9th Wonder]

I'd rather be with you babe, yes I do
I'd rather beeeeee with youuuuuuuuuuuu

[Hook]
Rather be, rather
Rather be, rather
Rather be, rather
Rather beee with youuuuuu

[Verse 1: Cole]
Yeah
Hey
Ay though I love you hate that bitch that's always with you
A Shame I gotta put up with her shit just to get you
She threw another fit you had to split because she was wit you
And now I'm at the crib all alone damn I miss you
Ay when we first met you was too tense for me to get through
And then I got you loose it's like a glove how I fit you
Your two lips they smell like tulips so official
My niggas'll probably clown me if I told 'em that I kissed you
But you clean as a whistle wet as a tissue in the toilet
Love to hit that spot get you hot like I boil it
Even let ol' girl watch she enjoy it
Even though she make it hard for me to see you
Knowing that I need you
Now look, don't make a grown nigga beg that ain't fair bitch
Just take them clothes off oh look you got your hair did
For me looks good she said oh you so sweet
Now get me while you can you bout to have to wait a whole week
Ah hell not the beast really I don't give a fuck
Well since you already bleedin' that mean I don't get to cut
Ay look I'm already fienin' so just let me slide thru
Tell your homegirl relax and let me get inside you
Because that booty mad thick behind your juicy ass lips
I'm trying to get you hot and wet you know Jacuzzi that shit
Then I'm bustin' like an uzi in this bougie ass chick
The only reason that I put up with this moody ass bitch
Is... you

[Hook]
Rather be, (Hey baby its... you) rather
Rather be, (Now baby its... you) rather
Rather be, (Hey baby its... you) rather
(And I... ) rather beee with youuuuuu

[Verse 2: Wale]
Yeah
She said I love you she talks tellin' me to kiss her up
But when her friend visits I doesn't get it much
Its soo-woo season and shawty dick teasin' now for that reason
Now my shit is like a crip sneaker
Listen love of my life, I'm tryin' to get some, a-
-ttention. You don't gotta listen just give a fuck
Your mouth, I don't need, your legs, you can keep
Just tryin' to get up in your jeans re-sew your seams
And your pussy was the cameo but stole the scene
So I got my camera on your cameltoe say cheese
Two lips blowin' kisses, muah to my mistress
Goodbye to my girl when I'm in it
I'll take you out shorty but let me know its mine
I'll paint you with my tongue and stay in those bikini lines
See it's a part of you I gotta be a part of
But every other part of you make me wanna depart and
Baby look at what you started, why am I working for it
Why are we still conversing when I'm sure you've heard the chorus
I'm sure you get the point and I prefer you throw it urgent
Your mind can say no but she can't control the urges
Because your booty mad thick behind them juicy ass lips
Trying to get you hot and wet you know Jacuzzi that shit
Then I'm bustin' like an uzi when I'm through with that shit
The only reason why I put up with this stupid ass bitch
Is because of you

[Hook]
Rather be, rather
Rather be, rather
Rather be, rather
(And I... ) rather beee with youuuuuu

[Verse 3: Curren$y]
Uh, and how I wish I would've met you first
Never had a chance to try
Cause your overprotective friend saw the lust in my eyes
So you she would hide cause she thought of me as a typical guy
Which you know I'm different, right
You listenin' to her is leaving you with empty nights
Recognize shawty, be real with ya'self
Mama feelin' herself literally
And I wondering if her mission is to get rid of me
Cause every time you come by to kick it
And I open up the door you bring her cranky ass with you
Influencing your decisions I can't even get a minute
Without her making attempts to garner all of my attention
She talk and I don't listen, I'm just picturin' me stickin'
And movin' you moanin', music on the counter in the kitchen
Spitta be that nigga bitches reachin' for my zipper
Cause they figure that's the way to my digits I beg to differ
Lifted like the research group, I so get it
She know you'll never be the same if I hit it
You know you longing for the stroke so you drippin'
She smoking and that'll be the scapegoat for slippin'
Oooo your booty so thick behind them juicy ass lips
I'm trying to get you hot and wet you know Jacuzzi that shit
Then I'm bustin' like an uzi when I'm thru with that shit
The only reason that I put up with this bougie ass bitch
Is... you

[Intro: Murs]
Ready?

[9th Wonder]
Uh-huh

[Murs]
Aight..........

After tonight
Don't leave your girl round me, heartbreaker for life
Ask my homeboy 9th

[Hook 1]
Got all your girlfriends thinkin' that I'm the (Bad Man!)
Never neglected you or disrespected you
Or Lied to have sex, yet you say I'm the (Bad Man!)
Gave you dick, never fronted, pulled your hair when you wanted
Used to flip you on your stomach, said you wanted a (Bad Man!)
Now it's all drama, an unidentified caller
On the phone with my momma talkin' bout I'm a (Bad Man!)
How could somethin' so bad be so damn good?

[Verse 1]
All I wanted was to fuck, from the start I never lied
Now it hurts my heart to have to see you cry
Let you know from the jump, I was that type of guy
Now you all on my voice mail askin' me why
Never kissed you in public and I never held your hand
I never said I loved you so I never was your man
How can we break up?, when we never broke down
And committed to each other, we was fuckin' around
That's how people get hurt, and we both do dirt
Now we could put this all behind us and make things work
Or I could get behind you cuz I like that skirt
Sorry 'bout that, got a one track mind
But if you say you don't wanna fuck me too, then you lying
Tryna fight it girl, shit bring your ass here
Who else can make you wet by doin' this in your ear
(See why you playin', all that bullshit you sayin')

[Hook 1]

[Verse 2]
She got me screamin' in public, in the middle of the mall
I lightly touch her arm, what'd the bitch do?, fall
Now they call security, it's about to be drama
I would never hit a woman, I was raised by my momma
But I kinda feel bad even though I didn't do shit
Now I gotta waste time to find a new chick
Someone who understand a man's gotta be a man
I don't wanna have to lie just to get into your pants
And ain't nothin' wrong with a one night stand
That happens twice a week, plus I'm nice in the sheets
And you look like a freak, it'll be to your benefit
A nigga you can fuck, and a nigga you can kick it with
I'm sick of this phone tag text message foreplay
I like to be spontaneous, that's my forte
Let's go to my crib and have, sex in the door way
We'd talk all night if you had things your way

[Hook 1]

[Verse 3]
She said this might make me look like a knight in shinin' armor
Great way to escape or get away from the drama
So I got a little momma, first, had to disarm her
Said she heard about us rappers, I still got to charm her
I'mma tell you what you wanna hear and make it the truth
Haven't been with a woman since I left Kamloops
Two months ago in Canada, ask my road manager
He'll tell you I'm a good guy, I wouldn't lie to you
Just because you look fly, look my bus cards are new
We'll shoot to my room, make the best out of twelve hours
We can wash that club smell out your hair in the shower
Turn down the power, lie down and make spoons
Or we can talk all night and listen to ITunes
You assume this the game that I spit to every girl
But I'm careful with my heart and who I let up in my world
(So, here's my number, call me anytime girl)

[Hook 2]
Just because I'm a musician she must think I'm a (Bad Man!)
All alone when she listens and I know what she's wishin'
But she won't pay attention cuz she thinks I'm a (Bad Man!)
It's not as bad as you think, cuz you had a few drinks
I'll hold you hair out the sink, you still think I'm a (Bad Man!)
I don't do this all the time, you are just that fine
Get that shit out your mind, I am not the (Bad Man!)

[Outro]
Bad Man! 3X[Produced by 9th Wonder]

[Chopped samples repeating throughout the song]
The rain - rain - (rain) - on my face
In the rain - rain - to hide my pain - on my..
Hey I like to go out in the rain - rain - (rain)
On my face - in the rain - rain - to hide my pain - on my..
Hey I like to go out in the..

[Verse 1]
See I'm a single black male, dark hair, dark eyes
Long walks through a park and a lot of them lies
I'm a little bit jaded by a lot of what I see
So if you're still interested you should come get at me
Cause I'm tired of getting shot down, put down and dissed
I wanna be picked up, held tight and kissed
But things like these don't happen to dudes like me
Because I'm more Coldplay than I am Ice-T
They say that good girls love bad guys and that might be
But a bad girl with a good guy, that's unlikely
So what's a man to do to get to hold hands with you?
Do I talk shit and stand and look hard with my crew?
I don't know what to do, so I drown in my drink
It helps to numb the pain, cause when I sit and think about it
Eyes get clouded, thoughts get crowded (thoughts get clouded)
So I'mma sit right here, wait for you to talk about it
In the.. c'mon

[Verse 2]
Said she had a boyfriend, just trying to be nice
But I've heard the same lines from different women all night
Too easy let down, but don't let it get you down
Shit, that's what my boys told me, but end of the night
I was still sitting lonely, if only I could find 'em
Without all the drama, without the one-liners
Excuse me miss, hey mam, you got a man, what's ya name?
I'm in my mid-twenties so enough with the games
Simply put I think you're stunning, and what about some kids?
A couple dogs, a couple cars, a four bedroom crib?
Look, I'm not trying to jib, I'm just speaking from the heart
But we can start with a drink if you wanna play it smart
She looking at my boy who got two kids at home and
I know how it goes, here's his number telephone and
He does the girl's turf, and I know you're smelling on him
But every bitch needs a dog, so I guess that's why you want him

[Verse 3]
I try to be subtle, but even flirting got me shooked
I would never get a smile, all I got was dirty looks
And my self-esteem is low enough, I got teased growing up
And what I do, I beat 'em up, but that only made me tough
It didn't get me girls, or notes in class
Same girls who used to tell, when I would pinch their ass
But if another boy did it, then they would get gritty
So I pretended the handball was their face when I hit it
And I admit it's part the reason why I'm do em like I do
And women in my life, there has only been two
My mother being one, and the other one is done
So my philosophy on dating is; ain't no fun
Cause they come and they go, and even if they don't cum
They still have to go, girl I give the best head
But you just wouldn't know, cause you stuck up in some diddy
But even if you dissed me, I ain't mad
Go on do that yo with yo pretty as..
You looked better coming..
No wait, you looked better going than you did coming
Her ass is amazing. High five for Jesus
Keep making 'em like that
Just make 'em with half a brain so maybe they'll talk to me[Verse 1: BJ The Chicago Kid]
I remember back in the beginning
I was scared to give you my love
I didn’t wanna let go of all these women
Then I believed and began to trust
And messing around was very tempting
Cus even the bad ones buss
And girl I never thought you’d be the one
To leave me

[Bridge: BJ The Chicago Kid]
I had to let it breathe for a while cus
Cus girl when you left me I was broken down
Yea I was broken down for a while but
But that’s when I woke up and said

[Pre-Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]
The first 5 minutes
I put you all in it
Then something went wrong and you ran
Over the next 5 minutes
You left for 5 minutes

[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid] (Add-2)
And that was your 15 minutes of fame
(5, 10, 15, time’s up)
(5, 10, 15, time’s up)
And that was your 15 minutes of fame
(5, 10, 15, time’s up)
(5, 10, 15, time’s up)
And that was your 15 minutes of fame

[Verse 2: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Heard the guy you left me for wasn’t even faithful
But you went to him anyway
Heard every time you left from seeing him yea
But he had another one on the way
Girl just to think I still love you
Yea, a nigga have to be crazy
And girl I never thought you’d be the one
To leave me

[Bridge]

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Add-2]
Hold up
Yo! Clock’s tickin'
I fell for someone who couldn’t stop trippin'
Listen up, if yo' heart broke you better glue the pieces
I put my ex down like there’s treasure underneath 'er
Love me in the limelight but the spotlight fades
Back of the jersey all you wanted was a name and
Guess I was to blame even thinkin' you would change
Like Spike, like Jack, I watched you play games every day
What’s the point of a partner you can’t depend on?
Drowning in emotions, that ain’t a surface to swim on
You never gon' get it like En Vogue in the friend zone
Seen it comin' quicker like a psychic who a nympho
But I’m cool on my bullshit
Like a matador with new shoes avoid the bullshit
Said I was the one like Neo and I’m guessin' you was right
When you left felt I dodged a bullet
15 minutes, 15 minutes
15 minutes, baby girl you’re gone
Know I used to love 'er, word to Common, I ain't never hatin'
I’m turnin' tables like I’m doin some redecoratin'
Fall in love, bring a parachute
Girl, love is blind, now I wonder what I seen in you
Girlfriends turnin', you want blowin up and now you like wow
Your 15 minutes end -- now

[Hook][Verse 1]
My love, what did I do
To make you fall, so far from me?
And now, I can't recall
The cause of the fall, selective memory
Then you, you built a wall
A 20 foot wall, so I couldn't see
But if I get off my knees
I might recall, I'm 20 feet tall

[Hook]
Whoa! Hey, I'm 20 feet tall, mmm
Yeah, oh yeah, I'm 20 feet tall

[Verse 2]
My love, what did I do
To make you fall, so far from me?
And now, I can't recall
The cause of the fall, selective memory
Then you, you built a wall
A 20 foot wall, so I couldn't see
But if I get off my knees
I might recall I'm 20 feet tall[Verse 1: Jean Grae]
Most of this here is just braggadocio
Emphatically spoke, impeccable rap flow
Second to that, wordplay akin to watching a verb
Hitting a piñata on the eve of its birthday
Uncommon like Erykah Phenomenon! Hysteria!
Hype, rocks millennium Sade criteria
Fuck the hearsay, please Jean's superior
Y'all yellow the same color of your bladder's interiors
You bore me to pieces, you feces mouth
And, yes, it's still shit if I mispronounce it bitch
How could it be doubted The beast mounted the pen
We're unsurmountable like you being surrounded by a ten man army in Afghanistan tents
With a caravan of Carolina and New York feds
Bless me with a holy 40 bottle from your corner stop and
Bet all your model entourage that we can get you popping
I'll deliver your liver on a plate with a slither of your shivering date
There's no mercy here put on your worsest gear
Your fucking with the word career
Assassin who just gave the job to murk ye onto Daily Planet
I raise havoc, like giving Mobb Deep a booster chair
Stupid, I'm uncouth and in the booth I'm rare
Name Northern Lights Pimp game, Dolemite
Spleens on assorted recordings I'm giving all the mics
Slaughtering them like cattle, hoarding the words
And then cornering them leaving just the ring it's absurd
I murder just for the fun of the sound of bodies falling
I'm eccentric I don't need white coats calling
It's just dementia, come on, quit your bawling
You'll only make Jean just slit your paws in
And then there's bloody parts and Jean's starts to saw and
It'll be ridiculous You're strawberry licorice
All over my kicks Mom mourning Snap! Picture this

[Verse 2: Daily Planet]
For the record Imma keep spitting
Game booking
And leave the game looking
Like a shepherd with its sheep missing
I know you seen Dai'
On a lean
Spray your team Tres schemes[?]
In Inglés wtih Jean Grae
Raising Cane phrasing slang cause shit is foul
In this flagrant game I'm O-fficial
Lingual assaults mangle
Wings on the archangel
The Grim Reaper's cane got my face and name
So I readily phrase spoke[?]
And repping respray hope and
I'm steadily paid til heavenly gates open
Rhyme's musical, I'm fluent through
Spitting lyrics your spirit is congruent to
Nigga, I been rapping I handle that
'long as I got a ten track and a camel pack
I paid my dues
Never half step
Used to stomp niggas down just to raise my shoes
Obey my rules or face consequence from lower lower 3rd, the 8th continent
Come one come all the track is strong
I'm talking Clark with no glasses on cats is wrong
Waiting on a rebel when there's factions armed
Y'all niggas playing on a level that I practice on
I'm willing to off these my aura's still in recital
Of killing them softly like Lauryn Hill with a silencer
So drilling your softies [?????????????????????]
Revealing your flaw, chilling, while peeling your top Please!Chorus
Left me standin here
On this lonely street to cry

[MURS]
This is a Living Legends, Justice League
Definitive Jux presentation
Brought to you by 9th Wonder aaand MURS

[Verse 1: Murs]
What up though, still givin' a fuck so
Open up your changer and get ready to dump those
Disc of the dudes that be soundin' the same
They get up on TV, steady clownin' for fame
Disrespectin' ancestors that was bound in them chains
But I'm around in the game so thangs is bound to change
I'm tryin to walk that thin line between intelligence and ignorance
Have a little fun while makin' music of significance
A nemesis to niggas just bumpin' they gums
I give a fuck where you from, it's where your heart at bitch
You gon' bite, little doggy, or just bark that shit?
A slave to the rhythm, 9th spark that whip
Cause my heart can't quit, I got something to say
Cause these niggas wanna act N.W.A
Niggas With Artillery and nothin' to spray
Just some non-writing assholes with nothin' to say

[Hook & 9th Wonder speaking]
That's right motherfuckas
Old salty ass, sideways ass motherfuckas
Y'all fucked up now, huh? MURS, get em

[Verse 2: MURS]
I'm from where we leaving running and we hop outta cars
Jump out and beat you down in some new All-stars
No stars and stripes, just bars and pipes
And niggas just start shootin', they too hard to fight
I'm scarred for life, and charge this mic with bars of fright
Dare any one of you frauds to bite
I'm raw as life with loss of wife and cause of strife
Spittin' sharp wit like I floss with knives
Not contrived or conceited, on your radio repeated
I'm elitist and I leave this Red Hot like Kiedis
I'm a Californicator, and a street narrator
Steady runnin' rappers down until they meet their maker
Concrete caretaker to these weak imitators, they a
Screech to my Slater, piece of beef to a gator or the
Heat versus Lakers, I'mma speak to ya later
And let 9th take me out with techniques and a fader

[Hook & Joe Scudda speaking]
What's wrong wit y'all man?
The fuck is y'all thinkin' bout?
Damn, them motherfuckas is lame man, get ya shit right man

[Verse 3: Murs]
I'm from the home of Double K, nothin' but trouble gang
KWS's, LTS's, OFA's
And every other crew that used to rack cans and spray
And mob the RUD before the MTA
So don't hate what I say or talk down when I bust mine
Tryin' to make some green like the Culver city bus line
I'm unsigned and hyped, dump mines on sight
This Living Legend gang, what you punks rhymin' like?
I combine with 9th, sickest with these beats
I mean so sick like he's forgettin' to eat
A hard man to take down like Michael Vick on his feet
And anybody chose me they was thinkin' defeat
I'mma spit with this heat until I get my credit
I'm a verbal martial artist like I'm signed to Shady Records
And you bitches best respect it or I will destroy you
Have your whole crew screamin' out "You're My Boy Blue!"* bonus track

[Sample]
"Holding you"

[Girl talking]
It's Murs bitch. Big ups to 9th Wonder baby. All the way to 2010, once again
They brought you another one and it goes like this...

[Verse One]
Murs, what up though? Still doin' my thang
Still not givin' a fuck, sold the game
In '04 showed you how to be a +Bad Man!+ on 3:16
And I showed you +The Pain+
Had to +Freak These Tales+ up with +Trevor An' Them+
And I +H.U.S.T.L.E.+ the same
+Walk Like A Man+, spit like an +Animal+
Cause I'm a +Dreamchaser+ and I'll do it again
Huh, it's such a pretty ass world
And I toured all over and met some Silly ass Girls
And this is for those that +Love & Appreciate+
I done gave up a lot of my old ways
I been sober, ain't been drunk in awhile
But I still won't hesitate to punch a punk in the mouth
The 9th Edition seemed hard to top
We got Revenge by goin' to the +Barbershop+
Change
It's funny how it comes around y'all
I'm still a maker of that underground raw
Shit
I ain't forgot that I'm a Legend
And I know where I come from and I know where I'm headed

[Girl talking]
This is 3:16 Part 2. Like, the first one was so big we had to make a second one
And this is it. Back and better than ever. It's now or Fornever
It's not over though. Murs, you got this?

[Verse Two]
Friends done came and went and me and 9th still here
Kill 'em with that sound that you like to hear
Ends, be gainin' them, you have a right to fear
These beats are threatening, we are quite sincere
The design of my flavor got me signed to a major
But now that that's over, it's time for the greatest
Haters, fans and bloggers
These are the greatest stanza's honest
Catch a nigga +Lookin' Fly+
I can make 'em dance to my shit
Toe touchin' on a stage, I can make those fans applaud it
Sweet Lord we done done it
But never in a day, from the soul to the stomach
The weather's feelin' great
We on the forth go round
Four albums in five years, this is how it goes down
Four albums in five years, how the fuck does that sound?
Forth album in five years, what they gon' do now?
Woooo![INTRO: Wale]

This is only for the hip-hop lovers
You want that bullshit - turn the radio on
Skyzoo, Wale

[Verse 1: Wale]

The one and only, homey still Thelonius with it
The only one spittin' like no one else livin'
No one that's breathin' is seen as an equal
Could breathe on the mic and give it epileptic seizures
They turn narcoleptic when them niggas start speakin'
Ridin' in that ES with my Nefertiti queen
And eyes low, pardon me, hah
We smoke the kind of green that turn the Simpsons Bruce Lee on
Hi-Ya, the higher part of my hierarchy
My mind potent like you high off keys or something
Shit, we don't believe none of them
Motherfucker, your career is a conundrum
And none drum, iller than Ninth Wonder
IV, no I can sell like mitochondria
I'm out the country, I'm jet lagging
They can't see me, I'm like the team that brought Brett back
And I'm man-genie, flyer than the rest of them
Wale Ovechkin
Fuckin' with that ice, them Landover niggas check ya
Check one-two, the mic is my weaponry
Lyrically or physically, step to me, you rest in peace
Watch what I do to beats, I don't need no jewelery
I was underground but wasn't trying to renew the lease
Yeah, hello mainstream, I'm a walking dollar bill ain't a damn thing changed

[Verse 2: Skyzoo]

I got mine while the rest of ya'lls was still looking
I'm top five, but no begging, dawg, I for real took it
So how they grilling me is literally just serenity
Literally, if you say you feeling me, then you feel Brooklyn
[Wale: Whatup!]
And I don't do colorful jeans or shiny kicks
My shoe game is Penny in ninety-six
I move aim, hit 'em and final flip
Whether it's a beat or a scam
I gave ya'll wizardry with my hands
I made ya'll want to be what I am
And as far as your fades I raised them all underneath where I stand
I'm pushing it for the corner
Keeping them on the hip
And, yup, I gave lyrics a reason to want to live
Fresh off the plane, Hong Kong, Beijing
Felt like I was home, the groupie love was the same
I'm Kobe in an orange jersey
And wrote this from 4:25 to 4:30, hah

[Wale] Okay

[Skyzoo] Yeah, I mean, I literally wrote that from 4:25 to 4:30

[Wale] That's about five minutes, guy

[Skyzoo] For real
They call me, S-K-Y-Z-O-O

[Verse 3: Wale]

And I'm Wale Folarin, was raised on go-go
They style is so-so, my Louis from So-Ho
Hoping that hip-hop can surface and go-go again
They go major, the flow is no longer
So everything retro come across so corny
Everything from Bradfords to gimmick spitters
To every nigga who rap and say, 'My shit's different!'
So get with us or lose like them niggas
Spent more on these kicks than Pac-Man spent on strippers

Haha! This just the beginning of the, uh, you know, the whole process of this Back to the Feature mixtape
DC whatup?
BK whatup?
PG whatup?
MoCo whatup?

Let me do some shoutouts
Mo betta - what up?
UCB - what up?
Hey Sycamore, whatup?
You ain't' doing shit til you put 10 gees on fantasy football
That's when you know you doing shit
Yeah, bitch[Intro]
Darkside!
You know it mean more to me when a nigga really live them lyrics you know!
Yeah! I mean like when I listen to a nigga I be like yeah I remember
Uh-Hah! I don't really remember them niggas, puttin it down like that

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
Wonder why the flow retarded
Cause the shit we author authentic
More realer than you fake niggas pretendin'
Uh! Late night long drives our main agenda
Get money fuck every bitch before we end up
Dead in the pine box make sure it's a hundred thousand
I grew up in public housin', boilin' crack in water fountains
Youngin on the park bench fantasizin'
Same spot he got shot and they can't revive him
Darkside is a tail of addictions
Turn your moms into a fiend cause you addicted to pitchin'
Uh! You gotta get the cuban three kilos
Giovanci the heat's on me
Got knocked turned quiet bet ya sing off key
Nah man I stay Cool like D.R.E
Living rooms with swimming pools filled with P.Y.T.'s
Fresh pair of J's and some PRPS you know

[Interlude]
Yeah! Uh!

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
Just me and my bitch, in the two seater
Mink floor in the wind, that'll move PETA
Get me a pot and a stove and I could move pieces
Thirty six of them o's I bought a Mona Lisa
Got more white chicks than a sorority house
While Fox News quick to point minorities out
I got a Mexicana chick, bad Dominicana
Pointed her out the crowd and her son's a punta cana
Put her in some pumps and designer Chanels
She got a pussy wet enough to douse the fires in hell
Got the iron on my seat and I pull up blastin'
9th Wonder on the beat and it's a fuckin' classic

[Outro]
Uh! Yeah! I wanna shoutout my brother Brent T.A.T
Bio, Nice and B.G. Shoutout to Shane 125th!
Uh! Coke too I see you, forever king![Intro: Phonte]
Fly love song, fly love song

[Verse 1: Erykah Badu]
Dream of a land, my soul is from
I hear a hand, stroke on a drum
Shades of delight, cocoa hue
Rich as the night, afro blue

Elegant boy, beautiful girl
Dancing for joy, delicate whirl
Shades of delight cocoa hue
Rich as the night, afro blue

[Hook: Erykah]
Two lovers dance face to face with undulating grace
They gently sway then slip away to some secluded place
Shades of delight cocoa hue
Rich as the night, afro blue

[Verse 2: Phonte]
New Tigallo, New Tigallo
Yo, you came to me as my blessing
I'm trying to accept it and not question
The whys and the hows without ob-sessing
It's a lot to think about, I'm still processing
Tears of joy in the morning made our pillow wet
Then night fell and we turned into silhouette
Your body next to mine dancing real close
Step left, step right, then a pirouette
It would appear as that we really do believe in us
But it's so hard to believe all we need is us
Believe a kiss on a cold day would be enough
Look at the stars, I wonder what it is they see in us
Where is this leading us? That's all I'm asking
Love comes in every color, but the fact is
I never needed Fifty Shades of Grey
Turn the lights down low and give me every shade of blackness, uh...

[Hook][Rapper Big Pooh]
Dear Pops, it's your boy
I got some things I want to say to you, man
Just a couple of words, bear with me
Gimme a minute

Time to face it
Sitting in the middle of the basement
Holding a jack
How I'm anticipating he 'gon call me back
Got so much on my mind
Ain't no holding it back
In fact, I give a fuck how he 'gon react
Through my first nineteen
Asking where he at
Never seen him in the spots where we be at
For the next couple hours I sat til the phone rang
No luck or no cigar
So I said to myself I'll try tomorr'
Me and my Vincent left out
Went to shoot play some ball
Came back, had message like 'this your pa'
Then I took to the phone
Conversation was raw
Shit, I had to let him know that his child was scarred
And right now we working through our mess
But I had to get some shit off my chest
So bear with me, y'all

[Refrain]
Just want to take the time to let you know
Sometimes it's hard to let my feelings show
The thoughts of guarantees are really so
This is all for you, you

[Phonte]
I was looking at your photograph amazed how I favored you
I remember being young wanting to play with you
Cause you was a wild and crazy dude
And now I understand why my momma couldn't never stay with you
From the roots to the branches to the leaves
They say apples don't fall far from the trees
I used to find it hard to believe
And I swore that I would
Always hold my family as long as I could
But damn
Our memories can be so misleading
It's misery
I hate to see history repeating
Thought you were the bad guy
But I guess that's why
Me and my girl split
And my son is leaving
I did chores, did bills, and did dirt
But I swear to God I tried to make that shit work
'Til I came off tour to an empty house
With all the dressers and the cabinets emptied out
I think I must've went insane
Thinking I was in love, but really in chains
Trapped to this girl through the two-year-old who carried my name
I tried to stop tripping
But yo, I couldn't and the plot thickened
That shit affected me, largely
Because I know a lot of people want me
To fail as a father
And the thought of that haunts me
Especially when I check my rear-view mirror
And don't see him in his car seat
So the next time it's late at night
And I'm laid up with the woman I'mma make my wife
Talking 'bout how we 'gon make a life
I'm thinking about child support, alimony, visitation rights
Cause that's the only outcome if you can't make it right
Pissed off with your children feeling the same pain
So, Pop, how could I blame cause you couldn't maintain
I did the same thing
The same thing

[Refrain] - 2X[Produced by 9th Wonder]

[Intro]
Chyeah
Eazy, Guru
9th Wonder

[Verse 1]
Ay, yo, we can't stop won't stop never intend to
They feel the style in Taiwan, we call it "newjitsu"
Back to New York all the shit that I been through
Some niggas say they dawgs but to me they just Shitzus, I pencils

All the shit into issues
All the principles, how to keep it official
Cause you ain't want no nigga have to grip that nistol
Mouth off the pistol, turn dudes to fish food, these dudes

Want me looking all miserable
Don't want me getting paper, go to Jacob to spend a few
But I be in them interviews, talking how I sit in coupes
And how to Tech, I spin a nigga like an interlude

Fuck around, give you flats like an inner tube
Poke you up, just some of the shit I'm into
So fall back, maybe you can get a clear view
Of my life and how I steer through my rear view

[Hook x2]
They got me back on the block again, back with the Roc again
Watching for cops again, all about the profit and
They got me back in this game again, but I swear
We all gon' be all right

[Verse 2]
Ay, ay yo they said it can't be done, no one can do it
I'm straight off promo, right back to it
Back to the booth where I gotta spit fluid
It's money in them streets, I gotta go pursue it

I'm the truest, you knew it, you know that 9th produced this
As soon as Guru looped it, you know it get stupid
I'm sort of a live band, cause my sound is acoustic
They ain't biting the style, they wearing girders to boost it

But, they say I'm slipping, that ain't no new shit
Them numbers never lie, so you can't refute it
And don't confuse M with none of them bullshits
To the streets I'm tied, like my momma's toots is

I couldn't fathom the sight of me losing
Any Malcolm X Boulevard, I'm 'bout movement
I'm getting money, I don't need your two cents
The structure been built way before The Blueprint

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Yo, it's M to the E-M, headed to the top with this
Say it's niggas on the rock that don't rock with this
Damn, that's the thanks I get, when you know I'm the one
That started all this gangsta shit

Wilding out for no reason, smoking that reefer with your heater
Just me and Jeter, tag teaming, heating the beat up
Rocking the Caeser, pushing a two seater with divas
Niggas didn't believe us, now they hate when they see us

And the grip got multiple features
Everybody got a car, dog, none of 'em leased
This a gift from a god, I don't go to the preacher
I floss for years, you watch me, I'll teach you

I just dropped M.A.D.E., I admit it was a sleeper
Everybody went out, copped it, now beating the streets up
Put it in my hood, in two weeks, it heats up
Bleek done stepped up, but Jay would never leave us

[Hook x2][Verse 1: Murs]
Damn time's done changed these thugs do what they like
Some of them be on Friendster tryna find a new wife
And still hit the block and slang rocks at night
But you could be dead wrong with your pockets right
Contrary to what the legendary B.I.G. had to say
You don't have to sell drugs or make the NBA
It's easy to get a grant and get an MBA
To achieve one goal there's more than one way
Young people on the whole, we have lost our way
I don't care what it cost I'm not impressed my nigga
That throwback jersey is a dress my nigga
I remember diamonds used to be girl's best friend
Enslaving Black children with them third world gems
I don't care about your rims, kids ride Big Wheels
Up until they learn balance and it's obvious you haven't
With way more ego than you have true talent

[Verse 2]
Any white boy who thinks he knows my struggle
Cause he listens to Pac and his adrenaline doubles
Now I ain't got problems with you being yourself
But when you front and use the N word, it just don't help
I might not trip, and your friends'll laugh at you
But I know some real niggas that'll straight up slap you
Now you could be down, but let's act growed up
Cause we ain't the same color when police show up
My culture's not a trend, being Black is not in
But for you it's just a phase you're gonna have to transcend
While even if I tried, I could never blend in
To society's mainstream, American dream
Yeah, it's all one love, but remember one thing
This music is my life, not a cultural fling
It's an expression of the soul when we dance and sing
And you are blessed to have a chance to even glance the scene

[Verse 3]
Man I do the same music, they stop coming to shows
It's like they scared of the white boys in the front row
First I was like "so?" I'mma get my dough
But the numbers kept falling as my fan base would grow
And now I'm concerned so I gotta speak up
First the money was the only thing shutting me up
But now I don't care, don't support me, get mad
Why wouldn't you abort me, my own people have
I feel I should have the scans white rappers have
It's sad but that's the way it is
What's the reason that my album doesn't sell like his?
And don't front like you don't why the hell that is
It's because he's white, you can relate to his face
Through the years you've been taught that Black is unsafe
Plus it's only natural for your own to be embraced
Conscious or subconscious you can't say that ain't the case
Only reason it took so long to take place
Was up until now your only choice was 3rd Bass
Or others like Ice, wasn't really that tight
Now you got some white dudes who can truly rock the mic
You relate to their stories cause you share that past
Question is, why would you listen to MURS' Black ass?
I asked myself for a while but now I finally get it
Good music transcends all physical limits
It's more than something that you hear, it's something that you feel
When the author and experience and passion is real
Used to feel I should be silent, I was scared to do this song
But I want everyone aware of what is going on
Yes it is jazz and yes it is the blues
And yes it is the exact same way they did rock
But I refuse to watch the same thing happen to hip-hop
I refuse to watch that bullshit...[Verse One]
A metal rock hit his face with a rush
They pistol-whipped him, shot him with his Dutch
He lost all his trust
Smoking Dutch, choking in his lust
Living out his lies, so one day he stole a pair of nuts
Tried to go hard, that’s the wrong song
He should’ve just jetted, Moet in his mind up was wrong
He could’ve made it but he waited, hesitated
Laying on a bitch, they caught him right in front of his Moms
They did him extra dirty, stripped him, tied his hands to his Vans
Them old school niggas left a victim
His blooded waist, broken arm, cut him in his face
I heard the chants, he don’t deserve life, let him lamp
Choking him, poking him, hitting him with all kinds of knobs
Left him soaking, ?? all in his mouth
He was out, they broke him up, knocked him out
Three times then threw him in a slouch
They took his sneakers and his beeper
Where’s Theresa? Snatched the reefer
That bitch is next, catch you on the sequel
Swollen eyes, his face was pulverized
Trying to be a hustler, two ounces he want to mobilize
Dumb dummy, no team, he barely had money
Flying around, old ass Jag, buying blow from me
Ski mask robbing, jean wearing ho sweetass[Produced by 9th Wonder]

[Verse 1: Big Pooh]
Aiyyo, what up Reese? It's been a minute since we last spoke
Side by side, in a circle round mad folks
We took it round each other wishing we were still close
But I'm grown and it's tough for you to swallow
I know it hit you hard when your boys hit you
And your letters, I never answered back to
Even though life keep me racing like a track dude
I bailed out in your time of need
But you fucked me over in your time of greed
We from the same womb, what happened to the creed?
An unspoken word between you and I
J-B's for life, we ain't supposed to cry
Remember after my first fight, we stayed up all night
Getting taught how to throw them thangs
If he defeat I, it's the force you bring
Harassing Kevin after lunch for about a week
How did we get to the point when we would hardly speak?
Pulling up to the house, fresh change of sneaks
Big buckets, pants stay tight from the big duckets
We all loved it, I was so naive
Big brother kept me smiling, tricks up his sleeve
Had me facing claves, cases and stacks of threes
My God, it ain't what it supposed to be
Barbeques, family and friends close to me

[Hook: Big Pooh and Phonte]
Aiyyo, I know we ain't spoke in a while
It's kinda foul cause a nigga getting older, ain't no time for you now
Wishing you was right here so I could hold you now
(You're so far away from me)
Aiyyo, I know we ain't spoke in a while
It's kinda foul, cause you getting older and now I'm missing your smile
And we went our separate ways, ain't no problems now
(You're so far away from me)
Cause one day we gon' still get down
We gon' still get down
Get-get-a-get-get down
Get-get-a-get-a-get-get down
Get to get, yo say, get to get down
One day we gon' still get down
(You're so far away from me)
Aiyyo, I know we ain't spoke in a while
It's kinda foul cause a nigga getting older, ain't no time for you now
Wishing you was right here so I could hold you now
Cause one day, we gon' still get down
(You're so far away from me)

[Verse 2: Phonte]
Check it, now what the deal baby? I'm still here, still crazy
I'm real sorry we ain't had a chance to chill lately
Or even talk as often now, congratulations
They telling me you almost walking now
Roads of life I'm crossing now
Can't wait to get you back to NC so we can all get down
And get real tight, have you dressed up rocking the ill Nikes
Show you what a father is supposed to feel like
It's been nights that I wake up thinking that I hear you
Back of my mind start feeling fearful
Thinking if the words I say are really getting to you
And when I hold you in my arms if my face look familiar to you
That shit is killing me dude, I pray that your eyes remember me
Black and white is all you can see in infancy
And eventually I'll have you on some comfortable shit
Two parent income, Claire and Cliff Huxtable shit
But right now it's all about this long distance
All I can do is get along with it, try and be strong with it
Fuck being long winded
Hearing you laugh is like music to my ears but the song ended
Me and your moms both missing your smile and all your silly faces
Even your hurl on our pillowcases
Goddamn it, this ain't how life supposed to be
Cause baby boy, you should be close to me, now run it down

[Hook]

[Outro: Phonte]
Yo, this one is for our peoples that is out there
We just want you to know y'all ain't forgot there
Oh yeah, we hearing y'all, and yeah, we feeling y'all
(You're so far away from me)
And yo, this one is for my peoples that is out there
And Little Dil and Little Jordan ain't forgot there
Oh yeah, we hearing y'all, and yeah, we feeling y'all
(You're so far away from me)
And yo, this one is for my peoples that is out there
Tyree R.I.P., you ain't forgot there
And yo, I'm hearing y'all, and yeah, we feeling y'all
(You're so far away from me)

[9th Wonder talking to baby]
Say somethin' boo boo
Say somethin' else[Hook]
Look I’m the man with the plan
So baby girl won’t you hold my hand
Baby girl won’t you hold my hand
Baby girl won’t you hold my hand
Say girl Look, I’m the man with the plan
So baby girl won’t you hold my hand
Huh yo Baby girl won’t you hold my hand
Baby girl won’t you hold my hand
Aye, c’mon

[Verse 1]
I walked in with my pimp game strong
Baby girl, you know it’s been too long
You know I miss you much, them thick lips and that big ole butt
Your boyfriend, look he know he in trouble
He ain’t nothing but my new stunt double
And I’m the man you deserve
You know these squares can’t handle your curves
I only fucked up once, you know you love me, why did you wanna front
And I won’t see her no more, she’s just a chick that I met on tour
Now you playing hard to get like you did back when we first met
You know the truth when it’s told right
So baby girl grab my hand and just hold it tight

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I was in grade three, she was a grade above
An older woman, it was crazy love
Didn’t know about the birds and the bees
I had just learned my ABC’s
Up behind her at the bus stop
Rubbing on her booty with my Batman lunch box
She was my date to the sock hop
I knew my time tables, plus I knew how to pop-lock
And it wasn’t a hard call
I bought her candy plus I beat her at dodgeball
Spray some TCB, overalls, one strap, I was BBD
Now I’m walking to her place
Binaca in my pocket, case I got up to first base
Picked her up at four and I went (holding hands)

[Intro: Murs]
Ready?

[9th Wonder]
Uh-huh

[Murs]
Aight..........

After tonight
Don't leave your girl round me, heartbreaker for life
Ask my homeboy 9th

[Hook 1]
Got all your girlfriends thinkin' that I'm the (Bad Man!)
Never neglected you or disrespected you
Or Lied to have sex, yet you say I'm the (Bad Man!)
Gave you dick, never fronted, pulled your hair when you wanted
Used to flip you on your stomach, said you wanted a (Bad Man!)
Now it's all drama, an unidentified caller
On the phone with my momma talkin' bout I'm a (Bad Man!)
How could somethin' so bad be so damn good?

[Verse 1]
All I wanted was to fuck, from the start I never lied
Now it hurts my heart to have to see you cry
Let you know from the jump, I was that type of guy
Now you all on my voice mail askin' me why
Never kissed you in public and I never held your hand
I never said I loved you so I never was your man
How can we break up?, when we never broke down
And committed to each other, we was fuckin' around
That's how people get hurt, and we both do dirt
Now we could put this all behind us and make things work
Or I could get behind you cuz I like that skirt
Sorry 'bout that, got a one track mind
But if you say you don't wanna fuck me too, then you lying
Tryna fight it girl, shit bring your ass here
Who else can make you wet by doin' this in your ear
(See why you playin', all that bullshit you sayin')

[Hook 1]

[Verse 2]
She got me screamin' in public, in the middle of the mall
I lightly touch her arm, what'd the bitch do?, fall
Now they call security, it's about to be drama
I would never hit a woman, I was raised by my momma
But I kinda feel bad even though I didn't do shit
Now I gotta waste time to find a new chick
Someone who understand a man's gotta be a man
I don't wanna have to lie just to get into your pants
And ain't nothin' wrong with a one night stand
That happens twice a week, plus I'm nice in the sheets
And you look like a freak, it'll be to your benefit
A nigga you can fuck, and a nigga you can kick it with
I'm sick of this phone tag text message foreplay
I like to be spontaneous, that's my forte
Let's go to my crib and have, sex in the door way
We'd talk all night if you had things your way

[Hook 1]

[Verse 3]
She said this might make me look like a knight in shinin' armor
Great way to escape or get away from the drama
So I got a little momma, first, had to disarm her
Said she heard about us rappers, I still got to charm her
I'mma tell you what you wanna hear and make it the truth
Haven't been with a woman since I left Kamloops
Two months ago in Canada, ask my road manager
He'll tell you I'm a good guy, I wouldn't lie to you
Just because you look fly, look my bus cards are new
We'll shoot to my room, make the best out of twelve hours
We can wash that club smell out your hair in the shower
Turn down the power, lie down and make spoons
Or we can talk all night and listen to ITunes
You assume this the game that I spit to every girl
But I'm careful with my heart and who I let up in my world
(So, here's my number, call me anytime girl)

[Hook 2]
Just because I'm a musician she must think I'm a (Bad Man!)
All alone when she listens and I know what she's wishin'
But she won't pay attention cuz she thinks I'm a (Bad Man!)
It's not as bad as you think, cuz you had a few drinks
I'll hold you hair out the sink, you still think I'm a (Bad Man!)
I don't do this all the time, you are just that fine
Get that shit out your mind, I am not the (Bad Man!)

[Outro]
Bad Man! 3X[Hook] [Phonte]
It goes work that body for all my niggas
5 star generals and y'all beginners
Rock on my niggas, get it on my niggas

[Verse One] [Phonte]
Mr. Get Busy
Mr. So Damn Nit Picky
Circle you squares till I get dizzy
And bum rush your whole spot
My raps slap box with robots like Sam Witwicky
I Left It All Behind now I'm taking my shit with me
Gave you a chance to shine not it's time that we gritty
And we can rhyme, go line for line, I got plenty of time
You can stay all day like Miss Milly
You rap niggas kill me
It's just to much for me
Fathered a style, then I gave up custody
Until reluctantly
My fam reminded, there's so many words that can't no nigga fuck with me
Such disgust
So many things I can dis-cuss
And lames that I can distrust
Touch, the radio sometimes to see what I might have missed
And from the sound of things, I ain't miss much
My nigga P said, "Take your time
It's like planets when they align
Hell you ain't even gotta rhyme."
Not boasting but I can coast it
Especially when niggas still tripping off the stuff we did in '99
But Tigga ain't a coward
And still my pride just can't allow it
So I'm gonna spit for the many dozens
Fans that kept a nigga hot when a nigga wasn't
And straight kept a nigga fed when a nigga struggling
Survived shut downs, break ups and Benny budgets
Surprised that I lived to tell any of it
This joint tip, but I'm anointing
So any shots this way about as pointless as titty fucking
Whoa son, you're doing it ass backwards
Tay spit fire from here to Grand Rapids
Michigan
Me and 9th, two of God's instruments
And when we get together, nigga call it band practice

"We have a band, that's all you need!"

[Hook] [Phonte]
It goes work that body for all my niggas
5 star generals and y'all beginners
Rock on my niggas, get it on my niggas
Work that body for all my niggas
5 star generals and y'all beginners
Rock on my niggas, get it on my niggas[Intro: Phonte]
They ask me what I think about the competition
And I say “No, I couldn’t care less about the team strugglin'
I wanna kiss you”

New Tigallo, New Tigallo, New Tigallo

[Verse 1: Phonte]
Tigallo and 9th Wonder, maybe
We got yo girl undulating
To the rhythm of the drum
Wet t-shirt lookin’ like a vacation
Take it off like Monday, baby
And there will be no underrating
So please hold your applause
Let it bump a little up in your cars
They say that boy’s back
Nigga, this is blackboard rap
You can gon’ chalk it up to a loss
And if you got a problem with it, walk it up to the boss
And get your card pulled like pitty pat
Body a verse and put it in a pine box
You niggas can get a fuckin’ shine box, Billy Batts

[Hook: Phonte]
And really that’s all my time, this is the last chapter
You x and y, we off the damn axis
Intricate, me and 9th, two of God’s instruments
And when we get together you can call it band practice

[Verse 2: Median]
Men of action, they hustle bass ackwards
Penny for your thoughts kid, miss me with that rappin’
Sho Nuff, I am like the master
See the glow what, grown up, I am that then
I am passion, two parts magic
Sprinkle in authentic, simmer with a little madness
Got a vendetta for the magistrate
Catch you in the world plain clothes, ain’t no tellin’ what’ll happen
That would be entrapment
Please, the audacity and casualty of crassness
I am absent minded for I am past it
Fry a fish much bigger for the inquisitive Jurassic
Picture Moby Dick, hold a flick, don’t miss it
May sank your ship, Ahab iddish
You need Arab benjamins when payin’ close attention to the mentionings
I too have brought an instrument for I’ve always known that they were listenin’

[Hook: Phonte] x2[Murs - Intro]
It's the barbershop, y'all know the rules..
No fighting, no cussing, no Cuz and no Bloodin'
And sit yourself down and act like you got some sense

Now I step through the door in the flyest pair of Dunks
Quit lying, you ain't seen these at Foot Locker, chump
And I ain't about to argue shoe game with you punks
Who don't know Air Jordans from some Reebok Pumps
And out of twenty-three, thirteen was the hottest
If it's rare and it goes on your foot, then I got it
I’m at Undefeated off La Brea playin' modest
While you running up to eBay to empty out your pockets

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Sock it, in the mouth if you don't wanna get clowned on
Metro-actin cats gettin frowned on, we sound on
Everything from ball to y'alls women
Ballers up in here and they bragging how they living
'Til they card get pulled, still at home with they mommy
Changing faces, Bull City, there's where you find me
Getting a low-down from the nigga innanet
You ain't done with my haircut, yet! I swear to God...

[Hook 2X]
Now if your fade is as tight as we is on the mic
Just got your whip clean and your kicks on tight
'Bout to pull the flyest chick you ever pulled in your life
Then you doing what we doing and you doing it right

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Ayo MURS, it ain't all about a cut to me
Wanna go somewhere, catch some comedy
And get the low-down on the drama, B
This lil' dude showing out, "Who his mama be?!"
It's a lotta trash-talk - "I dress better than him"
"Look better than them, you ain't got no style!"
Keep the pagers going wild with my new-new joints
Caught a glimpse in the mirror, can't keep me on point

[Murs]
Finally made it to Midtown, walked in the Legend's Isle
Got one waiting, so I gotta go second
Checkin it with Quan, cran and Goose
C-2 got his son in the shop running loose
To set the slang straight, ya girl is ya cape
And if she's blowing you out, then you gotta set her straight
Now everybody hate to wait, but it's so much fun
A bunch of dudes chilling, no beef, no guns

[Hook 2X]

[Murs]
Now my barber named Lester, he from the N-O
Best fades in LA if you, didn't know
Tighter than Jamie, in the Kanye video
Still freestyle and getting Gs' when I rip a show
Especially when it's in the scope, you know I'm gettin low
Shout out to all my playas that be chillin in the Mo'
...Slim, you don't want it with him
Peel ya cap back to the fat meet with this pen

[Rapper Big Pooh]
I been, in the chair, four bucks and some change
Can't keep takin breaks, cause he wanna go eat
Then he start taking breaks, cause he wanna go speak
I shoulda known better coulda went over to T, but
It's all gravy bread, put the money in his hand
Right now, got me cut like a new man
Caught up on my jokes, fashion to folks
Who I ain't seen since the last time we spoke

[Hook 2X]

[Rapper Big Pooh - Outro]
(YEAH) Aiyyo, 9th man, me and MURS we was in the Circuit City the other day, man..
An, and-and then took me back to the barbershop
Cause I ask ya boy, I said "Yo man, is Chris-Chris {?} here today, man? He workin?
And y'know what this dude ttold me man?
You, you-you know what this dude TOLD me, 9th? (WHAT?!)
He was like, he was like, "Naw man, to-the-Cameras ain't here today" - EUH-HAH!!!
(CAM-RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS!!!!)
Chris to-the-CAMERAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS!!!!!!
Bah! BAH! BAH! Shout-out to my man Jermaine
First cut..NIGGA! Nigga! Sorry Murs...[Produced by 9th Wonder]

[Intro]
(Base for your face, London! Everybody in the house make some noise!
(Base for your face x7)
9th Wonder
Lil B, BasedGod, Based
(Based for your face all day
Bsed for ya face, my nigga it's all -- yeah)
Brrrangdang, yeah

[Verse 1: Lil B]
This is real life from long nights
Niggas like me I bounce back it’s alright
Base for your face two times you don’t see no actin'
All they do is rhyme words, such typical rappers
I was defined by the struggle, metro phones
Got pictures of my partners that died, people like me
Cried a whirlwind came from drugs and guns
Used to call them cocaine numb
Niggas killas drive-by, the AK-47 took them little kids lives
All these young niggas, it's like a movie
Putting dots on they shirt, talking about Coogi
This is change, please excuse me I rep based world
Nigga, please don't lose me

[Hook]
Base for your face x8
Real complex rap
Yeah, I just speak, you connect the dots

[Verse 2: Jean Grae]
I'm a rebel rouser, the other rebels they crowd around her
To rebel levels are leveled up in the several thousands
Records house her like Africa read the jungle brothers
This is for townships, backpackers and seasoned lovers of music
Lil B's in love with the music
So leave a brother to use it, lead the public to new shit
See the puppets ain’t do it, you keepin' up what they viewin'
You see the numbers they doin', you feedin' us, the three of us
Plus 9th more than Kanye cuff dykes or cuff mics
This my nigga Phonte, Based God, the above types
Above the boundaries of music, the counter-culture groovin'
The kind of combination got you puzzled, clucked, and clueless
We do what we like so hit the comment section
Do this for life, so what we got in Common, resurrection
We tryin' to bring everythin' back, man
Everything and that includes

[Verse 3: Lil B]
Swag
Remember times I was strugglin' off my mindset
Remember that time will fly like a caterpillar
Graduate, I ain't even know that I shoulda
Sometimes don't hate when you know I coulda
Now I'm about to give back to the people, more than ever
Livin' like now or never
Sometimes people get distracted by the outside hate
Life turned into appetizers
And I tell my niggas, be a man of your word
I be fakin' bottomless, fuck it sleepin'
Watch your sleep cause them suckas will trick ya, thinking about niggas
Don't change for nothin'
I go back niggas still swing J's and sufferin'
I'm moving up in the world, gettin' humble as well
Stupid motherfuckers can’t tell this real B

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Phonte]
I'm back on my shit, pa
Back on my incline, Phontigga raisin' the benchmark
The young lions gave me a kick start
So here it is, pyramid schemin' on y'all niggas like Quickstar
The drug test flow got you pissed off
So many say the game is contaminated, you niggas is animated
Meanin' you not real, fake nigga you Pixar
A short story, Toy Story 3, where the kids are
Now we have lift off, so I'mma just stay firin'
Phontigallo low, stay flyin'
Y'all wannabe niggas stay tryin'
But God is my God, don't be ashamed
Swallow your pride just like a gay lion, roar
Came back for a taste, Lil B, Phontigga back on the case
Feeling like G money in my space
They ain't come back for the cocaine
They came back for the BASE[Rapper Big Pooh]
Open my eyes to a new day, spreading my wings
Taking shots of Crown cause I'm going through things
Everybody got they hands out looking for green
Coattails getting heavy cause I'm living my dream
I'm trying to school these young niggas it ain't all what it seems
I still struggle just like you, and I still hustle just like you
But it just so happens that Big Pooh doing what he love to do
Get back on my work, cause I was penning on this piece last night
That'll drive these niggas berserk
Tiggalo hit me up, Pooh its time to murk
Throw on a pair of sweats, And 1's, white shirt
Headed back to the shop, back to the spot where the hits keep coming
Stack them up like bricks, you can call me the mason of shit
Foundation has been rock solid no replacing, ya dig?
No replacing my nig, on everything that I live
We gonna let this bitch ride to our trains collide
Or we fall off track, and ain't no bringing me back
And everything that go for you the same applies to Pat

[Hook]
Cause even though the birds ain't singin' and the sun ain't shinin'
It looks like a beautiful morning

[Phonte]
Each day's another chance to do the things I could've
Done the day before, but I didn't and I known I should've
So I say a prayer for the gone for gooders
Who left this world, then kiss my girl "good mornin', shuga"
Another sunrise, and as much as I would love
To roll over on you I cannot do it because
The good Lord I prayed to him
And he said, "Niggas is listening now"
So I better have something to say to 'em
So I'mma tell 'em how it went down, man
Doin' shows for free goin' outta town, man
The way I almost broke down and, got a 9 to 5
Cause I had more press than the soundscans
This is the price that I pay for this music
And every word that I write is a testament to it
And if I had to go back, I wouldn't change a thing
Wouldn't re-cut it, re-edit, or change a frame
Cause it would not be fair, to turn my back on the struggle
When that exact same hustle got me here
Told niggas from the getup, we three the hard way
And Broadway's the only place you'll ever throw a set up
Speechless is all you'd be if we ever met up
I survived far to much now to ever let up, motherfucker

[Hook] - repeat
