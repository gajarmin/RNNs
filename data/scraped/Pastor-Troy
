[Intro]
Yeah (yeah)
This song here is called Goddamn, Vice Versa
(I'm doin' my best to save my people)
It's like, (The people and I will rely on God)
Picture everything that you thought was good, was really bad
Everything bad, was really good
(What if Heaven was on Earth nigga)
The whole world, vice versa
(Good is bad)
Vice versa (Bad is good)
(Hell on Earth nigga)
This shit here, Goddamn, go on
Go on and get you a mother fuckin' fat ass blunt of that 'dro
Smoke that shit
(It's all vice versa)
Look up in the air nigga
(We rich nigga)
(This is what we doin', it's vice versa)
I know all these real niggas gon' feel this shit
Vice Versa, Pastor Troy
(Vice Versa)

[Verse 1: Pastor Troy]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
What if Heaven was Hell and vice versa?
If I told you go to Hell, would you tell I cursed ya?
I reimbursed ya with the truth so you know my fate
And pray I die, I'm that nigga that they love to hate
I wanna make you use your mind, God has sent the sign
And when you listen to these rhymes, nigga take your time
Again I ask, Heaven was Hell and vice versa
Would you start doing evil in order to nurture the spirit man?
Do you understand that there's a war?
It's ragin' on and the devil got some ammo too
Don't get me wrong, but I put my trust off in the Lord
It's too corrupt, know that God gon' help me blow 'em up
I give a fuck, Heaven was Hell and vice versa, I have no fear
I done witnessed too much Hell right here, lend me your ear
Recall the beer we had to pour
For all our niggas, hit the Devil with the .44
Payback nigga!
My liquor keep me from tryin' to enter battle alone
And to deal with all this wickedness, I smoke a zone
Know I'm grown, but I'm still a baby
It's vica versa so I guess I'll beg Satan to save me
God I'm confused, the feuds of all these motherfuckers, makin' me sick
{*Virgin Mary never fucked nobody, but she suck dick*}
With a clique of nasty concubines, and vice versa
So she'll probably do the whole nine, that nasty ho
I don't know where I'mma go this Christmas, it's Satan's birth
I'mma try to smoke a pound of weed, and ease the Earth
While Jesus equipped with angels, the Devil's equipped with fire
For God so love the world that he blessed the thug with rock
Won't stop until they feel me
Protect me Devil, think the Lord is tryin' to kill me
It's vice versa
Heaven is below, while this dozier keep me high
To see the Lord Almighty nigga, I'm ready to die
My reply for any questions asked, "The Devil made me do it"
Who's the Devil may I ask?, It's so polluted
Uprooted from all this stupid shit
See me cremated, my adaption to the climate
So glad I made it
Elated that they gon' go to Heaven
But do they know Heaven may not be the place to go?
Again I ask, Heaven was Hell and vice versa
The devil's in me and I'll be damned if I'm gon let God hurt ya
Follow me...

[Verse 2: Peter the Disciple]
If this was vice versa, I'd be an angel, cause I'm a devil
A Down South Georgia Rebel, a whole 'nother fuckin' level
Reminiscin' on all the good and the bad that I did
Bustin' caps and splittin' wigs
And servin' nigs and talkin' shit
This is vice versa no fuckin' commercial
Heaven or Hell, where do we go
When we die, eternal fire or the streets of gold?
Only God knows, vice versa[Intro: Waka Flocka Flame]

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 3]

Niggas clowning with me, don't know they claimin they "G"
So fuck these beef cuz this real, just change your hand change the station
Watch the story bout hatin', then another bout basing
I'm taking risks to get it, but now I'm sick of this shit
So with these last couple dollars, we gone flip it legit
I bought this beat machine, bout big as a calculator
Who would have ever dreamed we hit the studio later
Its like I owe them basers, for making me take this serious
Wasn't for the struggle cuz, you would not be hearing this
In the midst I'm frisked bout three times a day
What I'm doing down here? Nigga this where I stay
I just pray, that I relay, a message to some
And let them know, goddamn, ain't no more play where I'm from

Act like my shit don't stink, pocket feel like a bank
Neck lookin' like a 40 ounce of O.E
Tell me why my album selling, they ain't murder me yet
If they do, bury me in a burgundy 'Vette
Talk behind my back, you could hate me all ya want
But them same fuck niggas ain't shot shit yet

Fully automatic rifle, 100 round drum on it with a scope

I ain't playing with these niggas, just kill 'em, turn it
Nigga talk shit, I'll blast that nigga
Shoot his ass right in front his homeboys
Kill the party, drove off and then stab that nigga
Everyone vicinity hear the boy ho noise
I'm the Zone 1 king, from a whole one thing
Threw a 100 on it, shawty, I was doing my thing
You tryna get a million, I done did that
Aye, keep it pimpin', keep a ticket where I live at
Aye, listen, sucka, I got nothin' for ya but a new coffin

Catch me walkin' in ya hood, trench coat swingin'

Them Bankhead niggas, they a muhfucka, ain't they?

In ya skinny jeans in arenas entertainin'
No matter how you paint it, better see the big picture
I'll get ya, nigga, wit' ya, then hit ya nigga!

[Hook][Verse 1 - Rich Boy]
I remember when I met'cha I was only sixteen
Who would ever thought that me and you would get this cream?
We took a lot of trips together, you stayed down
Remember when we start hoppin' on that Greyhound?
She say she like to play hide and seek in the ride
And sure I'll open up the trunk and hide her inside
She say she think I'm cheatin' wit' a girl named Jane
You ain't just my babay, bitch, you my everythang
I was broke but you maintained better
As long as me and you together we can get this cheddar
Whatever, her name white Sally
I met her through my homeboy Rico out in Cali
I thank Reagan for the haters when ya got hard
Ya bought me jewels, gator shoes and some big cars
Yeah you took me out the hood gave me good thangs
Now we on a private plane eatin' chicken wangs

[Hook]
(And I love you) You the reason why I ride good
You the reason why I shop good, drink good, smoke good
(And I love you) You the reason why these hoes choose
You the reason why a nigga sprayed candy on my old school
(And I love you) You the reason why I quarterback
Took a nigga out the projects, put me in a cul-de-sac
That's why I get it how I live boy
Cause you took me from a young broke nigga to a rich boy

[Verse 2 - Pastor Troy]
And I love you babay, mwah, hugs and kisses
Fuck them niggas and fuck them bitches
Been in this game since 1998
Nigga take the safety and shit but I'm great
Maybe it's fate destiny, you tell me
Damn near ten and that shit been free
But I'm P.T. so I gots to cruise nigga
Really ain't shit to prove to y'all niggas
All the cars, all the clothes
Wit' all the stars, and all the hoes
First class flights a nigga live in the lights
But see you in the dark, this stuff is kinda hard
See where I park, valet costs a note
Drop another fifty just to check my coat
Probably leave wit' yo' chick, know how I do
It's Pastor Disaster baby, I love you

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Big Boi]
Took me from a gun totin' nigga to a Big Boi
Too legit to slip now I got papers on my shit boi
And not just my weapons I'm talkin' 'bout titles and deeds
You payin' rent you can't afford and can't break out of ya lease
I'm out of ya league, I might as well be Ivy
All over ya ass like injections in a stripper's hiney
Rhyming is a skill that requires timing
Like dual ejaculation while my lady's riding
I'm 'bout to cum (I'm 'bout to cum) at the same time
You satisfied? (I'm satisfied) that's how I slang mine
A generation came up under my style
From penetration of the nation when I was just a child
Now, who's really in the critics talk 'bout me
Andre 3000 and three mo' niggas that's really fie
Let me break it down, I get fly at that mouth
I, stay fresh to the hosiery we 'posed to be

I'm a kill my damn self the night
I get fear, it ain't my fault he couldn't fight
It ain't like, when I motherfucking die, this whole world gonna fall apart
But it's a race, and I got a bad heart
Breath in the mouth, and I got a head start

I'm running for nothing, I'm running for nothing (x8)
So I'm gonna kill myself

A muthafucka tellin me what he gone do
When I knew the muthafucka wouldn't do shit
A nigga tease you, then a nigga leave you
Cause he heard that the shit done got thick, punk bitch
I get in the mood for cocaine
Cuz it's the only thing I see when a nigga look
Come and get the baking soda, then I flip the powder over
Then I got good dope when the shit cooked
But it crippled my to really understand that it really don't matter
What the fuck you been through

Said this nigga had ten birds, in Augusta for the week
From the islands
As soon as K told me this shit, I started smiling
Cause all I could see was
Money piling
Shit, on top of money
Now, ??? with the money for the week, and Chesapeake
The heat made my nigga take a break
If I could catch all 10 of them bitches, and I don't look suspicious
I'mma sell the fucking quart for the ?? the ha ha
As I told K bye bye, he shot me advice
If you gone do it nigga do it nigga, fuck thinking twice
This is ya nigga for life
Go fight 'em fire for fire
Hit my hip when you finish said his calling card expired
Hung up the phone, contemplating on who help me do it
There's Kia and Jessica and then Rhonda truitt
Now Jessica to stupid and Kia lie to much
I guess I'll take Rhonda, cause Rhonda don't give a fuck
But first I got to pump her up
I'm give her what, 10 g's
Tell her if she really love me she would do this for me
Eternally we'll be together for better or for worse
But first we got to take these niggas to the hearse
Burst in they shit, get the bricks come back out
I'm be waiting in the chevy, you know I'm ready to take em' out
If they front 'cha baby, come on, we make it we rich
Come on, shit, Rhonda, my down ass bitch

Chorus: [Help me Rhonda, help help me Rhonda (in background)
I'm the realist bitch
I'm mo' realer than reality
Fuck that dumb shit, it take nothing to a casualty
[Repeat 4X]

Well I'm the realist bitch
I'm mo realer than reality (well uh huh)
Fuck that dumb shit (uh huh)
It take nothing to a casualty (what)
FBI be after me, quareter ki in my womanly (uh huh)
Coming back from St. Croix
First lady to Pastor Troy (well come on)
Even I'm a Georgia Boy, cause boy I'm ready jack (well uh huh)
All you got to say is where them pussy niggas hangin' at (well uh huh)
Drop it like a maniac (uh huh)
Set it off by myself (well uh huh)
Fuck them pussy motherfuckers and who ever else

Pastor Troy:

Okay baby, you set it off, there will be no more living single
I'll be ready to tie the knot after we lick them for them blocks
Grab the Glock, and shot out the lot, and keep on bustin'
Then I'm gone bust in cusin' and leave his punk ass fa' nothing
Now what's in store for you is 10 g's
(That's enough for me, I don't give a fat fuck
What's the fucking hold up?)
About this time I saw a truck, to a familiar
K had said them motherfuckers had a truck similiar
Passengers are him and her, playing some reggae shit
Two a.k.'s, me and my bitch, one false move we gone spit
Guess the driver thank he slick, dred head motherfucker
Guess he most be know my bitch, Rhonda watch them motherfuckers
That owe 'em money, that what, with K.D. & Chesapeake
Heard that when he spoke with me and now her folk wanna smoke me
If he had the keys all I can do now is wonder
But for now me and Rhonda filling 'em up with the thunder

Chorus: (Repeat 4X)Hook: 8x

A blunt off in my mouth and some yak off in my cup
Chin checking, wig splitter, with a tank off in my pants
Fuck the talking, square it out, cock ya pistol let's dance

But since ya won'ts ta ask, then I got to let 'cha know

Hook: 8x

It's on da map (uh huh, yeah!)

Verse 2: Pastor Troy

I stand there patiently, then I start cranking up
This Remi in my cup
Tell them they fucking up
I come from way back, it's Bankhead ho
A North Avenue, 1342
While you at home with boo, I'm on the grind ho
I come from Georgia ho
Just thought I'd let y'all know
I puff upon my dro', the best I ever had
Please do not make me mad, with all the ackin bad
Boy I swear I got some bullets long as ding-a-ling
And I ain't only killing you I'm killing everything
So bling bling if ya wanna, I'm cut off jeans and a tee
I'm representing like a flag for D.S.G.B
Ain't nothing free so you ol' me for this ass spankin'
Where the muthafuckers from what'cha thinking

Hook: 8x

It's on da map (uh huh, yeah!)

Verse 3: Fabo

There come the police, knocking on my do'
With the GBI, said I was over the Georgia line
I committed a homicide
Running for my life this year it's 2000 I'm bout to get mine
Started flipping the scrip, on the grind, all the time
Now it's tragedy, cause everybody know what's happening
They got me up at the post office, they after me
Can't capture me
I'm a young gun, a desperado
Go blow for blow
I'm a hell of a nigga, they already know
I know they'll try that's why I got my vest protecting my chest
And I'm dressed in black boy
And that's the really take care of the rest
I'm feeling distressed, I know I should've but do I would
Muthafucker tried to buck, that's why I had to do it
I could've blew it, I did it execution style
He was on his knees and nailed his hands on the bathroom tile
I stayed awhile, and filled the house of evidence
They go through hell fucking with this Georgia resident

Hook: 16x

It's on the map (uh huh, yeah!)

(Pastor Troy)

They bout to see a blood bath, A blood bath
[repeat 7x]Troy:What that shit talking
Guy:Uh,Pastor Troy
Troy:Get the fuck away from my motherfuckin door
Guy:(Knocking on door)This P nigga,I'mma sign you up nigga
Troy:I do not feel like being disturbed
Guy:That D.S.G.B. album was straight my nigga
Troy:Will you please get away from my motherfuckin door
Guy:UUGGHHH!
Troy:I'll probly let your ass in

Nigga and I ain't never going to the door, without my piece
I don't know who's on the other side, beauty or beast
And If I do just happen to die, fuck that shit
I hope they bury me and drop me quick, I'm getting sick
Thinkin bout my so called enemies, til I explode
Grab the motherfucking 45, it's lock and load
And all these other pussy motherfuckers, they in danger
It's the wrong nigga to anger
The fucking dope
Slanger showed me how to do what I got to do
In this industry to make a livin
While all of my intentions was to avoid the prison
I'm still listenin for the Lord to tell me that I'm forgiven
I'm drivin to the point of no return where water burn
I learn that nobody out here really gives a damn
I know I sell dope,I know I bust on bitches but from bitches
So my nigga shit I am who I am
And yeah though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
It's pitch black so the shadow is a scene
I hear a faint voice red alert
Fuck that dirt and who you hurt
Young nigga persue your dreams
I started sellin dope when I was younger
What would you choose
Sell motherfuckin dope or hunger
It's up to you
But for me and the route I chose it wasn't my choice
Who's opinion who I need to voice
Just thank about it you's that nigga with no family
Ain't got no money
So you can't afford no sanity they thank it's funny
So you run across the Tec 9 to kill the laughin
Then they say they can't believe this happen
Actions speak louder than words this counries yelling
And do we go to Heaven or Hell it ain't no telling
I put my trust in God and whats the odds of who's the saver
Fuck em please come back savior
Cuz it's like this I don't speak so they fuck my shit
And now I'm faced with these crimes that I ain't commit
And It's fucked up cuz them bitches be the main ones
They wanna stick a nigga for some shit they say he done
These motherfuckers talking all about my danm fun
While toting guns, death is gonna be the outcome
For all them niggas, drink my liquor put my trust in God
I know that I must beat the odds, but this shit is hard
I disregard everything that they taught in school
With no diploma making move nigga who's the fool
As I sit with my strategy the game begin
And the Lord take my life from me I crack a grin
Ha, Ha, Ha
To friends tha missed the smiling
Have no remorse nigga me and Jesus wildin, like thugs
Cheifing leaves, and drinkin Hennessy
Like on the corner
Picture God feelin marijuana
As I relax and devilish demonds disapear
I got the feeling that a nigga gonna love it here
I take ya Biblical
Yall stay crunk off Mystikal
Stay crunk off of P
As long as motherfuckin Georgia can listen to me

We Ready[17x](till song fades)

We ready nigga we ain't giving a fuck about nobody
Cuz we ain't got shit to loose, I ain't got shit
I ain't jealous of these little lame motherfuckaz[Hook x6]

Chorus 4x

Yeah![Pastor Troy]
Lord I'm sorry, I'm tired
God I'm tired, God I'm tired
Don't nobody know what it is, don't nobody know it's like
I'm livin today thru tommorrow and I know I ain't gon' make it

[Verse 1]
Livin today thru tommorrow while yesterday was cursed
I put the pistol in my mouth and yell fuck the earth
I worked for food stamps without the book instead of helping me
Or blessing me my niggas below, I thank my niggas
And Tommy Hill can't help me figure a damn thang
Less than frontin me a pound of weed or some cocaine
I had got to the same conclusion that Uncle Sam made
Don't touch the dope but know it's movin'
And if it's proven what I'm doin's gonna hurt to the hustle
That's on the muscle this whole motherfuckin world is trouble
When I don't laugh took the color
Took the color blind while toatin dimes and my nut sack full time
I'm grindin playa, damn askin momma may I
I'm writin fire bet you wanna fuck up nigga start gettin high
I rely on my mother nature, quarter to break her
Gotta show her I appreciate her, with all these haters
That be constantly surrounding me, nowhere to go
So I smoke some weed and drink some mo'
Now they my friends and I been in a bunch of crazy moods
God please excuse quick to race because I love to loose
Yeah I'm the loser

[Pastor Troy]
God I can't take this no more, I can't take this no more
I'm sorry, I can't take this no more (*gun goes off*)

[Hook 2X]
Livin today thru tommorrow while yesterday was cursed
I put the pistol in my
Mouth and yell fuck the earth
Livin today thru tommorrow while yesterday was
Cursed
I put the pistol in my mouth, put the pistol in my mouth

[Verse 2]
Now see the thouhgts of what you showin me
A empty picture as I beg the world for everything
Never could get a piece of this american dream
(I took a nap) I took a nap when I wake up the same thang
Back in trap, shootin craps without shootin guns man that's my life
They say that I'm the son of God, I thinkin twice
The price of the leather see and I don't speak
As I preach keep the pistol in my reach
Cuz niggas crazy, look at how this doja made me man I don't sweat
Playin russian roulette with the tech place yo bet
Love let the devil kill me (I'll be okay)
Cuz I'm gone have to die any fuckin way why not today

ChorusWhat's up, big mouth, you still talkin' huh
Pastor, blast ya, okay, and well uh huh
This for, all those, niggas, that talk the talk
Fuck nigga, I walk the walk, don't make me get my assault
No charge if I get caught, I am connected
Got this rap game on lock, hell yeah perfected
Y'all nigga's pathetic, come around with that bullshit
Fuck around and get gunned down, playin around in my pulpit
Soon as I pulled it, they'll say he's deadly
Hell yeah, you got that right, nigga I'm ready
Y'all should'nt have let me, because PT gone rock
24 wit 24 blocks, m-o-n-e-y

[Hook] (repeat 2x)
I'm ready
I'm ready for war, fuck peace

I'm ready for war, I'm in these streets
I'm ready

And fuck them weak ass niggas
We droppin bombs

What's up, homeboy, what is the business
Pastor, church boy, can I get a witness
This for, all those, niggas that be poppin'
Seein' me in 6's, I don't never be stoppin'
Most niggas be watchin', other niggas be hatin'
Hangin' out their partner car, askin' me what's shakin'
Ain't nothin shakin', nothin but this mula
I see that you know me, but I don't know who you are
Therefore, I am, rollin up my window
Hasta luego, now it's back to my indo
Drivin' 100, mothafuck if I'm wanted
Take they ass on to Tennessee
Before they beat the hell out of me
Peep some real game from a mothafuckin G
Me and ???, me and Uncle B
Try to get some  millions to blow
Take this shit, I don't need no mo'
Off in the condo burnin dro

Shit real

[Verse 2]
Fake gold, fake soul, sold this, sold that
Story grew old, old vogues, old lac
But I'm back, verse two, and you, know me
Ain't no, owe me, you die, slowly
Holy, Bible, assault, rifle
Thou shalt, not kill, unless they make you feel
Like they, superior, naw brah, who you wit'
D.S.G.B. my clique, all the money that we can get
In the mix, gone and pick, I'm like Vicks Vapor Rub
Pinch a nick up out your dubb, who the fuck you think I was
Enough of the talkin', talkin', what's up
If we actin up, you best be backin up
Been buck, re-up, red mouth, straighten me
All these niggas be hatin me, because we keep all the D
O-P, add a E, O.P.P. we ain't down
None of my folks don't fuck around, quick to spit every round
Come on clown, you so bad, you so raw, you so mean
In the car, looking mean, all you see, is the beam
I'm the king, of the throne, still shown, every song
Punks do not live too long, Pastor Troy and now it's on

[Hook 2x]

Shit real

[Verse 3]
I make the ghetto my lobby, make they habit my hobby
Bought a little Arm & Hammer, cook it, sell then copy
Got me watchin for coppers, all I want is to prosper
Niggas clowning with me, don't know they claimin they "G"
So fuck these beef cuz this real, just change your hand change the station
Watch the story bout hatin', then another bout basing
I'm taking risks to get it, but now I'm sick of this shit
So with these last couple dollars, we gone flip it legit
I bought this beat machine, bout big as a calculator
Who would have ever dreamed we hit the studio later
Its like I owe them basers, for making me take this serious
Wasn't for the struggle cuz, you would not be hearing this
In the midst I'm frisked bout three times a day
What I'm doing down here? Nigga this where I stay
I just pray, that I relay, a message to some
And let them know, goddamn, ain't no more play where I'm from

[Hook 2x]

Now shit's realI was that cool motherfucker
But living in the world of these cruel motherfuckers
Society done made me a fool motherfucker
And sixteen shots leaving the pussies taking cover
Huh I'm sorry mother motherfuckers just ain't like me
The fucking grave by twenty one is so likely
A million letters from the pen niggas writing me
Fuck the system the DEA sellin all the damn yay
So I pray that them fuckers die
And when they leave let them pussy motherfuckers fry
And make they families eternally have to cry and
Crucify me and label me the n ride I testify I'm ready

Oh father come and take me I surrender I'm ready {repeat 4X}

Statistics said I wouldn't live to see the grey in my head
It's too much drama in the street too much heat and she said
Wanted by feds red said they wanted us in our tomb
So I keep my eyes red and I stay in my room
I'm prayin soon that my income cause income is halted
If you got then I got it but anyone can talk it
Now thought it was simply me but it's universal
Cause the shit's the real deal tryin to feel the commercial
America you tell me where is the freedom and liberty
This place ain't meant for me so I got a quarter key
And move it like ryder trucks
Them crackers already stuck
A path for my niggas because my niggas ain't give a fuck
Bout nothin they had to say we always gon' move the yay
Yo' game but we could play and Lucifer best to pray
That I do not do what I just planned to do yesterday
I swear to God in Georgia

Oh father come and take me I surrender I'm ready {repeat 4X}

This is for my folks in Cuba
This is for my folks in Jamaica
This is for my folks in Africa, we ready

Them crackers had me fucked up I scooped a job for a min
But couldn't deal with the pay I quit that shit in a day
Back on the grind servin my yay nothing to say
But I tried I'm told it's a better way but who gon' pull me aside?
They in they ride disappointed because I had bad luck
I ain't never want to sell this shit my nigga I'm stuck
My people roll they window up and then they hit and they locked
Its fucked up but thats the way it is down here on the block
Maan everyone servin some rocks if not some rocks some weed
Everybody's trapped high I can't afford the heat its kinda neat
How they just creep and kick the door off the hinge
And when theses motherfuckers leave they taking all of my friend
No way to win cause we are in for the ride of our lives
I was writin' this shit I had to wipe my eye
Cause this is chaos they after us we'll never succeed
Cause we some ignorant ass niggas but all we need is to see I guarantee
If we stop competin' get our children off these fuckin street
And get them to readin', now I'm just speakin', shit who am I to tell anyone
I'm telling ya, it ain't nothin' new up under the sun
You got your gun well fuck ya gun
If you goin run when they chase ya
Why don't you do some of that crazy shit and threaten them basers
Now or later we going to have to stand up and fight
We pay the taxes in this bitch nigga use your rights
And I know I ain't right but I'll be damned if I'm wrong
They say two wrongs don't make a right
But damn its making me strong and when I'm gone
I hope this song rang in your heart
My nigga ain't no better time then right now to start

Oh father come and take me I surrender I'm ready {echoes} {repeat 4X}[Intro: Future]
Oh, you know you ain't got all them guns
And you ain't killed nobody yet
How many times you shot that muhfucka?

[Hook: Future]
Talkin' bout ya poppin' tags, nigga, you ain't bought shit

Now my nigga Mike WiLL giving me a chill pill
But a nigga crunk still, plenty niggas got killed
I don't give a fuck though, still got some ammo
Dressed in camo, represent Atlanta, ho
Pastor Disaster back like the rapture
Don't let me catch ya, ho, I'm coming at ya
Bap on my shoulder, pocket full of doja
Keep my composure, fuck pulling over
Brrrrr, stick 'em, fuck the niggas with them

Fuck a wrist game, use my whole arm, my nigga

Fourth quarter pressure on 'em like Kobe
Act like my shit don't stink, pocket feel like a bank
Neck lookin' like a 40 ounce of O.E
Tell me why my album selling, they ain't murder me yet
If they do, bury me in a burgundy 'Vette
Talk behind my back, you could hate me all ya want
But them same fuck niggas ain't shot shit yet

Straight up

Fully automatic rifle, 100 round drum on it with a scope

I ain't playing with these niggas, just kill 'em, turn it
Nigga talk shit, I'll blast that nigga
Shoot his ass right in front his homeboys
Kill the party, drove off and then stab that nigga
Everyone vicinity hear the boy ho noise

Threw a 100 on it, shawty, I was doing my thing
You tryna get a million, I done did that
Aye, keep it pimpin', keep a ticket where I live at
Aye, listen, sucka, I got nothin' for ya but a new coffin
I'll shoot you walkin' 'fore you get through talkin', nigga!
Catch me walkin' in ya hood, trench coat swingin'
Mask on, step up on ya front porch bangin'
Them Bankhead niggas, they a muhfucka, ain't they?
I'm the realest, richest nigga that you know today famous
Catch ya flaggin' in ya hood and ya wanna be a gangsta
In ya skinny jeans in arenas entertainin'
No matter how you paint it, better see the big picture
I'll get ya, nigga, wit' ya, then hit ya nigga!
