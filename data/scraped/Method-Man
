[Part 1: Pound Cake, Produced by Boi-1da, Matthew Burnett, and Jordan Evans]

[Intro: Jimmy Smith]
Good God Almighty. Like back in the old days. You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock but we just went in the studio and we did it. We had the champagne in the studio, of course, compliments of the company, and we just laid back and did it. So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you. Because we had a ball. Only real music is gonna last, all the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow...

[Hook: Timbaland]
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all

[Verse 1: Drake]
After hours of Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' women and vino
The contract like '91 Dan Marino
I swear this guy Michael Rapino's boosting my ego
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growin' 'bout who they think is the best now?
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talking, say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents, but thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn
With the ink I could murder, word to my nigga Irv
Yeah, I swear shit just started clickin' dog
You know it's real when you are who you think you are

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
I had Benzes 'fore you had braces
The all-black Maybach but I'm not a racist
Inside's whiter than Katy Perry's face is
Yellow diamonds in my Jesús
I just might learn to speak Mandarin
Japanese for the yen that I'm handlin'
International Hov, that's my handle
My saint's Changó, light a candle
El Gran Santo on the mantle
Case y'all didn't know, I speak Spanish too
Shout out to World Wide Wes
Everywhere we go, we leave a worldwide mess
Yes, still Roc La Familia
Says a lot about you if you not feelin' us
The homies said "Hov, it ain't many of us"
I told 'em less is more niggas, plenty of us

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jay Z]
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, cake
500 million, I got a pound cake
Niggas is frontin', that's upside-down cake
Get 'em a red nose, they clown cakes
They shoulda never let you 'round cake
Look at my neck, I got a carrot cake
Now here's the icin' on the cake
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, uhh
I'm just gettin' started, oh, yeah, we got it bitch
I've done made more millionaires than the lotto did
Dame made millions, Biggs made millions
Ye made millions, Just made millions
Lyor made millions, Cam made millions
Beans'a tell you if he wasn't in his feelins
I'm back in my bag
My eyes bloodshot but my jet don't lag
A pair of Jordan 3's tryna chase this cash
Gucci air bag just in case we crash
Uh, last night was mad trill
I'm fresh out of Advil, Jesus grab the wheel

[Part 2: Paris Morton Music 2, Produced by Detail]

[Verse 1: Drake]
Look, fuck all that "Happy to be here" shit that y'all want me on
I'm the big homie, they still be tryna lil bro me, dog
Like I should fall in line, like I should alert niggas
When I'm 'bout to drop somethin' crazy and not say I'm the greatest
Of my generation, like I should be dressing different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit
And do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doin' it the same
Man, I'm doing it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here
So I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts that I would share with myself
But I thought "Fuck it"
It's worth it to share 'em with someone else other than Paris for once
I text her from time to time, she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to
I got a compound but I think she's straight
Cause she supported since Hot Beats right before Wayne came
And got me out of the back room where I was rapping with Jas over beats that I shouldn't have in the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway
Three months later, I'm his artist
He probably wouldn't remember that story
But that shit stick with me
Always couldn't believe when he called me
You never know, it could happen to you
And I just spent four Ferraris all on a brand new Bugatti
And did that shit cause it's somethin' to do
Yeah, I guess that's just who I became, dog
Nothing was the same, dog[Refrain: Mary J. Blige and sampled Notorious B.I.G.]
You're all, I need
Lie together, cry together
I swear to God I hope we fucking die together
To get by
You're all, I need
[Lie together, cry together
I swear to God I hope we fucking die together]
To get by

[Verse 1: Method Man]
Shorty I'm there for you anytime you need me
For real girl, it's me in your world, believe me
Nothing make a man feel better than a woman
Queen with a crown that be down for whatever
There are few things that's forever, my lady
We can make war or make babies
Back when I was nothing
You made a brother feel like he was something
That's why I'm with you to this day boo no fronting
Even when the skies were gray
You would rub me on my back and say, baby it'll be okay
Now that's real to a brother like me baby
Never ever give my cootie away and keep it tight aight
And I'mma walk these dogs so we can live
In a fat-ass crib with thousands of kids
Word life, you don't need a ring to be my wife
Just be there for me and I'mma make sure we be
Living in the effin lap of luxury
I'm realizing that you didn't have to funk with me
But you did, now I'm going all out kid
And I got mad love to give, you my nigga

[Refrain x2]

[Interlude: Mary J. Blige]
Like sweet morning dew
I took one look at you
And it was plain to see
You were my destiny
With you I'll spend my time
I'll dedicate my life, I'll sacrifice for you
Dedicate my life to you

[Verse 2]
I got a Love Jones for your body and your skin tone
Five minutes alone, I'm already on the bone
Plus I love the fact you got a mind of your own
No need to shop around you got the good stuff at home
Even if I'm locked up North you in the world
Wrapped in three-fourths of cloth never showing your stuff off, boo
It be true me for you, that's how it is
I be your knower, you be my Wiz
I'm your Mister, you my Misses with hugs and kisses
Valentine cards and birthday wishes, please
We on another level of planning, of understanding
The bond between man and woman, and child
The highest elevation, cause we above
All that romance crap, just show your love

[Refrain]

[Outro: Method Man]
I'm sick of police
Cheeba cheeba y'all
And you don't stop

No romance without finance for now
Baby, please, ninety-five
Ticallion Stallion, ha ha, ha ha
Man woman and child, yeah[Produced by Easy Mo Bee]

[Verse 1: Notorious B.I.G.]
I used to get feels on a bitch
Now I throw shields on the dick, to stop me from that HIV shit
And niggas know they soft like a Twinkie filling
Playing the villain, prepare for this rap killing
Biggie Smalls is the illest, your style is played out
Like Arnold and that, what you talkin' bout Willis
The thrill is gone, the Black Frank White
Is here to excite and throw dick to dykes
Bitches I like em brainless, guns I like em stainless steel
I want the fucking Fortune like the Wheel
I squeeze Gats till my clips is empty
Don't tempt M.E
{Meth}...T-H-O-D Man, here I am
You don't want to fuck with the me

[Method Man]
I'll be damned if this ain't some shit
Come to spread the butter lyrics over harmony grit
It's the low killer death trap, yes I'm a jet-black ninja
Coming where you rest at, surrender
Step inside the ring, you's the number one contender
Looking cold-booty like your pussy in December
Nigga stop bitching, button up your lip and
From Method all you getting is a can of ass-whipping
Hey, I'll be kicking, you son, you doing all the yapping
Acting as if it can't happen
Your frontin' got me mad enough to touch something
Yo I'm from Shaolin Island and ain't afraid to bust something
So what you want nigga, you won't nigga
I got a 6-shooter and a horse named Trigger
It's real, '94 rugged-raw
Kicking down your goddamn door
(And it goes a little something like this)

[Hook]
Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit
Everything you get you gotta work hard for it
Honeys shake your hips, you don't stop
And niggas pack the clips, keep on

[Verse 2: Method Man]
Verse two, coming with that Olde E brew
Meth-tical, putting niggas back in I.C.U
I'm lifted troop, you can bring your wack-ass crew
I got connections, I'll get that ass stuck like glue
Huh, no question, I be coming down and shit
Yo I gets rugged as a motherfucking carpet get
And niggas love it, not in the physical form but in the mental
I spark and they cells get warm
I'm not a gentle-man, I'm a Method Man
Baby accept it, utmost respect it, and
[Notorious B.I.G.] (Assume the position)
[Method Man] Stop look and listen
I spit on your grave then I grab my Charles Dickens
Bitch

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Welcome to my center, honeys feel it deep in they placenta
Cold as the pole in the Winter
Far from the inventor, but I got this rap shit sewed
And when my Mac unloads I'm guaranteed another video
Ready to die, why I act that way?
Pop Duke left Mom Duke, the faggot took the back way
So instead of making hoes suck my dick up
I used to do stick-ups, cause hoes is irritating like the hiccups
Excuse me, flows just grow through me
Like trees to branches, cliffs to avalanches
It's the praying mantis, deep like the mind of Farrakhan
A motherfucking rap phenomenon, plus
[Method Man] I got more Glocks and Tecs than you
[Notorious BIG] I make it hot
[Method Man] niggas won't even stand next to you)
[Notorious BIG] Nigga touch me you better bust me three times in the head
Or motherfucker's dead, you thought so

[Hook][Intro: Method Man]
Ma, Ma, throw down some money
The ice cream man is coming

[Hook: Method Man]
Watch these rap niggas get all up in your guts
French-vanilla, butter-pecan, chocolate-deluxe
Even caramel sundaes is getting touched
And scooped in my ice cream truck, who tears it up

[Verse 1: Ghostface]
Yo honey dip, summertime fine, jewelry dripping
Seen you on Pickens with a bunch of chickens how you're clicking
I kept shooting strong notes as we got close
She rocked rope, honey throat smelling like Impulse
Your whole shell baby's wicked like Nimrod
Caught me like a fresh-water scrod, or may I not be God
Attitude is very rude boo, crabby like seafood
It turns me on like Vine's Cee Allah Rule
They call me Starky Love hon, check the strategy
By any means, Shirley Temple curls was done by Billie Jeans
Black Mrs. America, your name is Erica, right true
Lazy eyeball, small feet, six shoe
Caramel complexion, breath smelling like cinnamon
Excuse me hon, the Don mean no harm, turn around again
God damn, backyard's banging like a Benzi
If I was jiggy, you'd be spotted like Spuds McKenzie
I'm high-powered put Adina Howard to sleep
Yo pardon, that bitch been on my mind all week
Back to you Maybeline Queen let's make a team
You can have anything in this world except C.R.E.A.M
So what you wanna do, what you wanna do
Let's go ahead and walk these dogs and represent Wu

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Shaolin's finest, what up boo, peace your highness
Yo I'm lounging, big dick style y'all niggas is the flyest
Moves you're making too fly jewels are shaking
Not a rape patient, you're looking good fly colored Asian
Ghettoes, them is your hometown
We can go the whole round
After that, I'm shooting downtown
I'm rocking hats and your wig is all intact
Who's that queen bee chick, eyes pearly black
Freaks be moving in fly sneaks
Two-finger rings and gold teeth and ain't afraid to hold heat
So when I step in the square dear
You better have C.R.E.A.M. to share, Ricans, ven aqui yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Cappadonna]
Black chocolate girl wonder, shake ground like Thunder
Politic to your deficit step, gimme your number
Your sexy persuasive ta-ta's and thighs
Catch my eyes like highs, I want your bodily surprise
Double down some time, Ice Cream you got me falling out like a cripple
I love you like I love my dick size
Ooh baby I miss you, your sweet tender touches
Take pulls off the Dutches
Orgasm in my mindstate, masturbate in your clutches
I want you for self like wealth, so play me closely
Chicks are at each other for the sting, who want the most of me
Only a hard dozen wanna be calling me cousin
Thirsty for my catalog, baby shopping spree you're loving
Call me if you want to get dug like the pockets
I jism like a giant, break wombs out of the sockets

[Outro: Method Man]
Wu-Tang in the cut, for real niggas what
It's the after-party and bitches want to fuck

[Hook]

Ice cold bitches melt down when in my clutch
And want their titties sucked, ice cream
Yeah, your guts

[Hook]

Ice cold bitches melt down when in the clutch
They want they titties sucked, ice cream
One love to my chocolate deluxes, keep your nails done
And your wigs tight, word up
One love to my butter-pecan Ricans for calling me Papi
That's for real
One love to caramel sundaes, with the cherries on top
Yeah and big up to my French Vanillas
Parlez vous, francais, mi amor, merci, oui oui, bon bons
And all that good stuff, that good stuff[Hook: Amy Schumer] x3
Milk, milk, lemonade
Milk, milk, lemonade
Milk, milk, lemonade
'Round the corner, fudge is made

[Verse 1: Amy Schumer]
I used to think that my tits was where it's at
Used to be concerned that my booty was too fat
But now I know the truth and that worry has been shot
Big booty's what they want and big booty's what I got

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2: Amber Rose]
Tits are old news if you know what I mean
All the guys love my fudge machine
Look me in the eye
Get your face in, don't be shy
You say you don't like asses
Cause I fart and break your glasses

[Bridge: Amy Schumer]
Turd cutter
Loaf pitcher
Dookie maker
Fudge machine
Cheektastic
Booty mastiff
Giant tuchus
Fudge machine

[Verse 3: Amy Schumer]
On my booty empire, the sun never set
Take a shot, yeah, nothin' but net
Milk, milk, lemonade
'Round the corner, fudge is made
I'm gonna make you scream and shout
For the part of my body where poo comes out

[Refrain: Amy Schumer]
This is where my poo comes out (x4)
Talkin' 'bout my fudge machine (x4)

[Verse 4: Method Man]
That's right, ladies
Ain't nothing better than a big, beautiful sexy booty
But bottom line, no matter how find a behind
You better call that onion what it really is
That's just a fudge machine
Turn up

[Hook]

[Refrain 2: Amy Schumer]
This is where her poo comes out
This is where your poo comes out
This is where their poo comes out
This is where our poo comes out

[Refrain 3: Amy Schumer] x2
This is what you think is hot
This is what you think is hot
This is what you think is hot
Talkin bout my fudge machine

[Outro: Method Man]
It's where your poo comes out[Verse 1: Dat Nigga Daz]
You find an MC like me who's strong
Leaving motherfuckers aborted with no verbal support
And when I command the microphone I get deadly as Khan though
With a bear and a snake and a panda, I'm all those
Who can withstand, the more power I gain
And make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck your brain
Imagine and keep on wishing upon a star
Finally realizing who the fuck we are
When I penetrate, it's been withstanding, faded
Would it be the greatest MC of all time
When I created rhyme for the simple fact
When I attack, I crush your pride
My intention to ride, every time all night
I'm faced with the scars beyond this one bar
For me to put down my guard, I'm faced with it, I'mma ride
Breaking in gas with the '68 all day
In-and-out with my pay, I'm soon to count the bodies

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
So mandatory, my elevation
My lyrics like orientation
So you can be more familiar with the nigga you facing
We must be patient, nothing better than communication
Known to damage and highly flammable like gas stations
Sorry I left that ass waiting
No more procrastination, give up to fate and get that ass shaking
I'm busting, and making motherfuckers panic
Don't take your life for granted
Put that ass in the dirt
You swear the bitch was planted
My lyrics motivate the planet
It's similar to Rhythm Nation
But thugged out forgive me, Janet
Who's in control, I'm activating your souls
You know, the way the games get controlled
Yo, two years ago a friend of mine
Told me Alize and Cristal blows your mind
Bear witness to the dopest fucking rhyme I wrote
Taking off my coat, clearing my throat

[Hook: Method Man]
I got my mind made up, come on
Get into, get into
Let it ride, tonight's the night

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
Well I comes through with two packs of the bomb prophylacks for protection
So my fucking sac won't collapse
Cause nowadays, shit's evading the x-rays
Sending young motherfuckers to an early grave
I wonder if my terrifying tactics of torturing MC's
Shows my heart's as cold as the tundra
Electrifying like thunder, I'm just too much
Rough and raw with that motherfucking poisonous touch
I'm a MC with lyrics that's the fuckin' bom-bay
You got ten steps before instant death like Bai Mei
My rhymes, I leave a mark on your mind
As the deadly vibes spread through your head like Sand Palm
There's no escape, nah, I ain't blastin'
I use my mental to assassinate assassin's for those askin'
Opposed to laughin', raw maniacal villain
Laughter enhances the chances of the killin'
Why is that? Cause smiling faces deceive
You best believe: to MCs, I'm the deadliest disease
My thoughts rip your throat and make it hard to breathe
Your whole camp's under siege, and I'm Jason Voorhees
In the heat of the night is when I defeat and ignite mics
My verbal snipe your vocabs on site
I'm out the cut, uncut and raw with no clause for all
So all my rhymes hit and split the bricks on the wall
You already have an idea about the superior sphere
The greater rhyme creator on both sides of the Equator
I rock from here to there, to Philly and back
To LA on the spot where I rock and bust like straps
As your views get overshadowed when you come in contact
Beware: set and prepare to enter verbal combat

[Verse 4: Method Man]
Fuck you losers, while you fake jacks, I makes maneuvers
Like Hitler, sticking up Jews with German Lugers
The Mr. Meth-Tical from Staten Isle
Will be back after this message, don't touch the dial
Rarely do you see an MC out for justice
Got my gun powder and my musket, blaow
Melons get swellings, I paint mental pictures like Magellan
Half of my Clan's repeat felons
Niggas best protect they joints for nine-nickel
Man, I stay on point like icicles
Now who wanna test Tical, then touch Tical
All up in your motherfucking mouth
Headbanger boogie
Catch me on tour with Al Doogie
Method Man rolled too tight, you can't pull me
Better take one and pass, or that's that ass
Your vital statistics are low and falling fast
Johnny Blaze out to get loot like Johnny Cash
Play a game of Russian Roulette and have a blast

[Verse 5: Redman]
Lyrical gats spitting the criminal tactics
Non-believers get my dick and genitals backwards
Let's face it, there's no replacement
Taste this madd underground basement shit I'm laced with
Avalanche on your whole camp when I'm spliffted
Funk Doctor who, Spock, bitch, don't get it twisted
I got connects like Federal Express
To get the fresh package of bless the dogs can't fetch
Got the clear spot from the rear block
To bust 'til every nigga here drop, men I fear not
Hold your nose and blow out 'til your ears pop
Since your crew suit you to shift, now you claim that your gears locked
Whiff this underground cannabis
I'm dangerous like John the Bomb Analyst
Flip MC's like ki's
My degrees freeze consecutively like EPMD LPs
Lick off a shot and hit your fam by mistake
So I erase the whole front row at the wake
I planned my escape in case Jake wann' snake bust it
I'm the one pushing the hearse in the first place
Confidence for you shaky-ass folks
Pump for Rockafella for the day he got smoked
Choke off this antidote, got you ope
Get roast by my lyrical Billy Dee .45 Colt
And I'm out for 9-nickel

*in the background*
[INS the rebel][Intro: Method Man/Johnny Blaze]
Special technique, fuck that
Special technique of shadowboxing, Goddamn
The GZA, Goddamn
The GZA, Goddamn, pledge allegiance to the hip-hop
Method, Goddamn, I pledge allegiance to the hip-hop
Maximillion, Maximillion
Johnny Blaze
I pledge allegiance to the hip-hop
Johnny Blaze, Maximillion
Maximillion

[Verse 1: Method Man/Johnny Blaze]
I breaks it down to the bone gristle
Ill speaking Scud missile heat seeking
Johnny Blazing, nightmares like Wes Craven
Niggas gunning, my third eye seen it coming before it happen
You know about them fucking Staten kids, they smashing
Everything huh, in any shape form or fashion
Now everybody talking bout they blasting, hmmm
Is you busting steel or is you flashing? Hmmm
Talking out your asshole
You shoulda learnt about the flow and peasy afro
Ticallion stallion, chinky-eye and snot-nosed
From my naps to the bunion on my big toe
I keeps it moving, know just what the fuck I'm doing
Rap insomniac, fiend to catch a nigga snoozing
Slip the cardiac arrest me, exorcist hip-hop possess me
Crunch a nigga like a Nestle, you know my STEEZ
Burning to the third degree, sneaky ass alley cat top pedigree
The head toucher, industry party bum rusher
You don't like it dick up in you fuck ya

[Hook]
Allow me to demonstrate
That's right, you corny-ass
The skill of Shaolin, rap motherfuckers
The special technique, better go back and check
Of shadowboxing, your fucking stacks
Shadowboxing, cause your naps ain't nappy enough
And your beats ain't rugged enough, bitch

[Verse 2: GZA]
I slayed MC's back in the rec room era
My style broke motherfucking backs like Ken Patera
Most rap niggas came loud but unheard
Once I pulled out, round 'em off to the nearest third
Check these non-visual niggas, with tapes and a portrait
Flood the seminar, trying to orbit this corporate
Industry, but what them niggas can't see
Must break through like the Wu, unexpectedly
Protect Ya Neck, my sword still remain imperial
Before I blast the mic, RZA scratch off the serial
We reign all year round from June to June
While niggas bite immediately if not soon
Set the lynching, and form the execution date
As this two thousand beyond slang suffocate
Amplify sample through vacuum tubes compressions
Cause RZA, to charge niggas twenty G's a session

[Verse 3: Method Man]
When my mind start to clicking and the strategy
Is mastered the plot thickens, this be that Wu shit
I don't give a cotton-pickin' FUCK
About a brother tryin to size a nigga up, I hold my own
Hard-hat protect your dome
Look at Mama baby boy acting like he grown
No time for sleep, I gets deep as a baritone
Killa bee, that be holding down his honeycomb, lounging son
Wu brother number one, protect your neck
Flying guillotines here they come, bloody bastards
Hard times and killer tactics, spitting words plus
Semi-automatic slurs, peep the graphic
Novel from the genie bottle, hit the clutch
Shift the gear now, full throttle, time to bungee
To the next episode, I keeps it grungy
Hand on my nut sack, and spitting lunghies
At a wack nigga dat, don't understand the fact
When it come to RZA tracks I don't know how to act
Real rap from the Stat, Killa Hill Projects
How to be exact, break it down
All in together now
Things are getting good looking better now

[Hook]
Allow me to demonstrate the skill of Shaolin
Sha-shadowboxing, the special technique of shadowboxing[Intro: Method Man]
16th Chamber, temple number five

[Method Man]
Somebody said it's on, if it is then I'll be set
To blow a nigga up, with my Five Fingers of Death
I bring it to his whole damn fam, understand
If he frontin, on any man down with the Clan
I be comin, for that headpiece you can't cope
For my brother, I even kill a Pope, word to mother
Serial, killa, style from the Isle of Stat
My peoples are you with me where you at?
Shit's gettin deep in here, I mean like thick
Niggas lookin all in my face like they want dick
It's about to hit the fan, hit the flo'
That's all I can stands, and I can't stands no mo'
What is it? Niggas think they bigga
Because they got the finga on the trigga of a biscuit
They don't know I'm wicked, when I start to kick it
With the raw sound, wash it down with a Mystic
Better yet a Snapple, nigga want the juice
But he don't want the hassle
Thought they trying to overthrow the castle
Better yet the temple, I'm comin to your town
Black down, the rental, car, the pistol
YAH! If you don't want a burn from Glock
Then beware, I buck shots, meaning what, the buck stops
Here, no more dough will be made
Unless it's being made by who... the 1-6-Ooh

[Interlude: Raekwon] + (Method Man)
Chamber four (1-6-Ooh) Chamber four
Temple number nine, temple number nine

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
I'm the original G-O-D
Making young ladies scream is my specialty
When I go ooh-wah, ooh-wah, ooh-wah, girls wanna get hype
From the funky fresh music that was stereotyped
When I kill, that ol' mad rugged flow
Not sayin Ason, is like a duck of disco
Or a disco duck, I'm strictly hip hop
Yo, Ason, what's up? I can't stop...
Wu-Tanging, flipping the script and
You could test my skills, but niggas must be trippin
Coked up from sniffin, you're the one who's riffin
I'm not Opie, save that old shit for Andy Griffith
You start to flip, now ya slip, cuz you're slippin
While you sleep I be the God on point, like Scottie Pippen
As I, jump on stage, cold flip a rip a show
Strip or rip a ho, ready like Bo
Jackson while I'm still taxin, I'm maxin
Relaxin, sittin backs and, laying tracks and
Again and again when I rock this jam
I wanna see 'em up in the air, throw up your hand
Introducin, the one-man band
A child that's wild, now with the style, couldn't stand
Niggas wanna jump, then stepped, to the center
Of the rhyme inventor, MC tormentor
You get jacked and slapped, across the MC map
I laugh at ya ass, on a horse shack
Come on through I black and blue your whole crew
Then I get rudie with the Hong Kong Phooey
The Ol' Dirty Bastard, MC killer
Money maker, Brooklyn, Shaolin style
That I lay down like tile
Gotta hit you up, one blaow, so you better come down...Uhh, hahah, Ruff Ryders niggas (all my niggas)
(All aboard!) Blood in blood out
Funk Doc, Sheek Luc', Meth-Tical (whattup niggas?)
Yo, yo, aiyyo yo

[Sheek]
Soon as I cop the nine, I pop the nine
When I take it out the box, I represent LOX
Now when I flow, you hit the rewind button
So I charge out more, want it all at the door
Fuck heat, Sheek walk around with an oven
Who you gonna kill with that little Foreman grill?
How its gon' look when I come through your block?
Sheek, Funk Doc, Meth on top
Porsche, 300 horse fly by
Back open pumpin "How High?" (How High)
Yeah, can y'all see that (See that)
Bitch you can call me what you want, 'cuz "I'll Be Dat" (Be dat)
Get off my dick, I don't care about no jewels
Long as the condo's paid and the truck I choose
I'm tellin y'all niggas, if its not double R
I'mma spell my name out on the side of your car

[Hook]
Come and Ruff Ryde with us
If you wanna get high with us
If you wanna get down with us
Come on nooooowwwww
Come and Ruff Ryde with us
If you wanna get high with us
If you wanna get down with us
Come on nooooowwwww

[Redman]
I got a twin cam exhaust connected to the jaw
A five speed clutch on my paw when I write
I glow like the pegs in Lite-Brite
3000 volts of lightning when you fly the right kite
Me and Meth be Hennessy, two ice cubes
We can draw (choose your weapons) or do I choose?
When I choose the grip, one shot lose your hip
I hope your shoes fit for this move and pick
I avalanche your camp with, ten feet of snow
I'm cold blooded, my fam half-eskimo
My flows move like indo;
Turn ten nickels to ten loads, outta ten sto's
Ride the crash course, do the math on it
Swizz Beats you can ride Amtrak on it
But I'm on it, grillin with George Foreman
Ya peeps is at the Grammy Awards cornin
The ice, the fat wallet son, I want it
And the helicopter warmin before mornin
Def Jam nigga, Redman nigga
Got - "fuck ya momma" on my sweat band nigga
You tough guys'll get smacked in the club
COme with the gun I bought from Mack in the club
Its P-P-P from Bricks to Brook-nam (C'mon)
(C'mon) Bring me some more ass to whoop on

[Hook]

[Method Man]
Look what the cat dragged in
Underground dweller from the cellar bring terror
Scoop of high yellow Cinderella, Meth forever
Never rush a rhyme, hope to never bust my nine
But if I have to, I have to, it's all in the mind
I stay ahead of time while y'all fallin behind
Tryin to relight ya lime
It's a crime when I drop bomb lines designed
To tick, tick, BOOM blow your mind
Yeah me, M-E-T, H, the O, the D
Can't be done, like tryin to find a penny in the sea
Nigga run, for cover son go and get them guns
Y'all ain't from here, don't try to come around here gettin ones
Swizz Beat the track in the head, but I instead
Pull my dart gun and bust sixteen until it's dead
I'm the game, all of my dogs be off the chain
Yellin Wu.. Tang, Wu.. Tang

[Hook][Intro: RZA (Method Man)]
Roll that shit, light that shit, smoke it (roll it up niggas)
Roll that shit, light that shit, smoke it (4:20, y'all, it's time, it's time)
Roll that shit, light that shit, smoke it (it's been a long time for this man
Niggas been sleeping on the kid, man, everybody got some sideway shit to say)
Roll that shit, light that shit, smoke it (Carlo! Know what I'm saying, man? Yeah)

[Method Man]
Fast or slow mo, oh no, Meth done made a killing
Call the po-po, oh niggas is squealing, oh, y'all ain't feeling
Niggas no more, the bigger they are, harder they go though
Good pussy put a hump in my back like Quasimoto
Hah, my sex ain't homo, season vet, hold the adobo
Got rappers on that low carb diet, y'all can't get no dough
I keep a low pro, file, excuse me as I get smoked out
Put hands on these niggas, then put the roach out
Go head, I'm wishing you would, ask if it's good
Man, this Tarzan shit in the woods, my shit is hood, bitch
That means I'm hood rich, telling you lies
Straight out the pull-pit, it's like Merrill Lynch I'm on that bullshit
Real spit, money come first, and even worse
You need all your toes & fingers to count up what I'm worth, trick
So when I blow a smoke cloud in your face, just take a hint
Dick, you crowding my space, it's Mr. Meth, pa

[Hook: Carlton Fisk]
It's 4:20, roll up, nigga getting smo-ked out
No seeds, California weed have you choked out
No doubt, roll up, which rims spoked out
4:20 mean either you roll up or roll out

[RZA]
Roll that shit, light that shit, smoke it
Roll that shit, light that shit, smoke it

[Method Man]
So on and so on, I flow on
Power to our people, get your smoke on
And I'm so gone, off, that sour diesel
Hard to hold on, but hold on, it's like I'm Pretty Toney
With that robe on, got terrorist shook, because I'm so bomb
The hood, put, me in position, I'm in the kitchen
With that cook book, the service I'm giving, birds they vision
Not a good look, told ya my nigga, Tical deliver
Hook or crook, lots of asses to kick, wish I had a bigger foot
Yeah, taking it there, hating who care
Y'all stay out my mental, I got killas waiting in here
To get you, as I sharpen my pencils, tear apart instrumentals
Fuck it, y'all niggas is pussy, so is the dick that sent you
RZA, we done it again, Co-D occassion
Here's to short skirts and Ol' Dirt McGirt, okay, then
Let's get it popping, like it ain't nothing to get it popping
The big and rotten's the city, too good to be forgotten

[Hook] - 2X

[Streetlife]
The rap game won't like me
You can tell that a nigga is shiesty
If I die, my second born'll be like me
Slide dick to your wifey
Never know your baby boy just might be
Quick to rob a jack, he's so icey, stay dressed to kill
From the Hill, never ran, never will
Attitude, like, fuck you still, I see you missing the point
This is not a rap song, you get clapped on
Bullets break the bone, like the joint, call you out your name
Disrespect ya moms, spit on your dame
Go public, then, shit on your fame, you overlooking the fact
Where you from, is where we at
And y'all don't want no, parts, in that that
Caught your verse for sale, but real niggas don't shoot & tell
We'd rather do the time and rot in the cell

[Carlton Fisk]
The inner outer state, bi-coastal smoker
Inhale, Cali piff with a swift of glaucoma
Black jeans, black Timbs, black Benz roaster
Smoke rise, out the sun roof when I roll up
Verrazano, with no relation to Gravano
Carlo, shots are hollow, still cop a bottle
And pour some out, moment of silence, then I swallow
I'm still alive, and still the sun'll come out tomorrow
Shine shine shine, and grind, cuz it's money on my mind
And I'm moving like my life is on the line
For the bullshit, I really got no time, a full clip
Really gon' let ya niggas know what's on my mind
When ya getting out of line, have them choppers lit up
You won't need a camera phone to get the picture
Chalk down, tape around, body bag zipped up
Carlo Verrazano, you can call me mister

[Hook][Intro]
[LL Cool J] Make it butter
[Redman] I'm gonna Bankhead bounce
[LL Cool J] No doubt
[Redman] Aiyyo watch your mouth
[Redman] Aiyyo, one two three four five six seven, blaze the hot
[LL Cool J] Trizack that sound like heaven
Seven six five four three two one
C'mon, Meth-Tical, come and get some

[Verse 1: Method Man]
Playing my position, hot Nick, son
This one, for all the sick ones, infliction
Poisonous darts sickening, best believe
Finger itchin' with two broke legs, now I'm trippin'
On MC's cliche, shot that ricochets
Start trouble bust bubbles, hip to wicked ways
Gotta love me, G-O-D, no one above me
Look good but fuck ugly
Tap your jaw from my Punch Buggy sunning you
Got you shittin in your last Huggie, running who
Fuckin punk, get a speed bump coming through
A single shot make yo meat lump, respect Wu

[Verse 2: Redman]
Aiyo I put it on a nigga, shitted on a nigga
Turn a Christian to a certified sinner
The bomb I release, time pent up (explodes)
While you got sent up I was hitting your ex ho
Shit I kept low, petro' your metro
Politic, keep the chickenheads gobblin
Shit I'm driving in, come with funk halogen
Terrorize your city, from the spliff committee
Kick ass till both Timberlands turn shitty
Gritty, smack the driver's head in the gypsy
When I approach rappers be taking notes
I drop like I shoulda invented the raincoat
Absolute, I love to burn to the roots
I keep comin til your pour sperm from your boots
Vigilante hardcore to the penis
Tell you fuck you my attitude is anemic

[Verse 3: Canibus]
I'm the illest nigga alive, watch me prove it
I snatch your crown witcha head still attached to it
Canibus is the type who'll fight for mics
Beatin niggas to death and beating dead niggas to life
When you look at me long enough, I start to read your thoughts
If the signal was strong enough, and then I'll call your bluff
Like, "Yo, how many rhymes you got?" I think I'll go on
For more Milleniums than Mazda's got on the car lot
And there's nowhere to run ta, when I confront ya
Nigga, I call your bluff like you had a phone number
Who wanna see Canibus get wild, who wanna act fly and
Get shot down with a surface-to-air missile
I take em on in all shapes sizes and forms and spit on
Anybody who ain't close enough to shit on
Zero to sixty? I'm already doin a hundred
When I'm blunted and I give it to any nigga that want it

[Verse 4: DMX]
Stay out the dark, cause if I catch you when the sun is down
Run it clown, come up off that, or I'm gon' gun it down
When in doubt, however skull goes, it's gon' be that
See that, that shit'll finish you dawg, believe that
Where we at, do you value your life, as much as your possessions
Don't be a stupid nigga - learn a lesson
I'm gon' get you either way, and it's better to live
Let me get what's between your sock, cause it's, better to give
Than receive, believe what I say when I tell you
Don't make me put you somewhere where nobody'll smell you
And when the lights is out, they don't come back on
This ain't a flick you ain't gon' come back on
You ain't that strong
You knew it was wrong, but you asked for it baby
You'se a pink nigga, ski mask for it baby
So I can hit you up on Front Street, you think I'm sweet
Want heat, one deep, leave him behind, front seat

[Hook]
Aiyyo, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven
Blaze the hot trizack, shine like heaven
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one
Come on Mr. Smith, come get some

[Verse 5: LL Cool J]
When young sons fantasize of borrowing flows
Tell little shorty with the big mouth the bank is closed
The symbol on my arm is off limits to challengers
You hold the rusty swords, I swing the Excalibur
How dare you step up in my dimension
Your little ass should be somewhere cryin on detention
Watch your mouth better yet hold your tongue
I'ma do this shit for free this time this one's for fun
Blow you to pieces, leave you covered in feces
With one thesis ("LL Cool J is hard")
Every little boy wanna pick up the mic
And try to run with the big boys and live up to the real hype
But that's like picking up a ball, playing with Mike
Swingin at Ken Griffey or challenging Roy to a fight
Snapping, you amateur MC's
Don't you know I'm like the Dream Team touring overseas
For rappers in my circle I'm a deadly disease
Ringmaster, bringing a tiger cub to his knees
In the history of rap they've never seen such prominence
Your naive confidence gets crushed by my dominance
Now let's get back to this mic on my arm
If it ever left my side it'd transform into a time bomb
You don't wanna borrow that, you wanna idolize
And you don't wanna make me mad nigga you wanna socialize
And I'm daring every MC in the game
To play yourself out position, and mention my name
I make a rhyme for every syllable in your name
Go platinum for every time your grimy ass was on the train
Watch your mouth don't ever step out of line
LL Cool J nigga, greatest of all time[Hook: Megan Rochell]
We both know, that our love will grow
And forever, will be you and me...

[Method Man]
Give me a woman that get down for me, my one and only
That don't fuss or fuck around on me, or leave me lonely
Not just a honey, but a homey, just wanna hold me
Cuz she got alotta love for me, and put it on me
If I need that, plus she understand me when I beat that
It's sweet like candy, this time, I might just eat that
You steal my heart, sweetheart, then you can keep that
Let's bar hop and find us a spot where we can chief at
Push the seats back, you got the kinda body niggas beep at
Try to speak at, but get no feedback
Sophisticated, Miss Highly Edumicated
Living well, lady that made it, type of woman you stay with

[Hook]

[Method Man]
Give me a queen that respects a "king", just like Coretta
Get everything except the ring, for worse or better
Even through the stormy weather, rain, sleet, snow
Whatever, see if it go down, we go together
Like Twix bars, ain't no problem that we can't fix, ma
You ain't gotta sugar my tank, or key the kid car
Cuz broken hearts leave big scars, when emotions get hit hard
Niggas get drunk and hit the strip bar
But that ain't even ya man's style, even back as a manchild
That's where I stood, and where I stand now
I'm throwing rocks at your window pane
Trying to bang, girl, like injure pain, you know the game

[Hook]

[Megan Rochell]
No matter what we go through (what we go through)
I'll be there for you (there for you)
I'll never let you down, I'll just hold you down, oh-oooh
No matter where we be (where we be)
I'll do it all again (all again)
The ups and down, I'll hold you down, oh-oooh

[Method Man]
Give me a woman that get down for me, my one and only
She don't fuss or fuck around on me, or leave me lonely
Not just a honey, but a homey, just wanna hold me
Cuz she got alotta love for me, and now I gotta
Lotta love for her, might even take a slug for her
And everywhere we go, pull out that red rug for her
Yeah, them back rubs in the bathtub, got me cleaning my act up
I'm ready to shack up, now that's love

[Megan Rochell]
Nobody can love you like me boy
I'll promise to be your only girl
Don't ever leave, just stay
You will be down for me, anyway
Ahhhhhhhhhh, you and me together, baby

[Hook][Verse 1]
Man, I don't know what they smokin'
Our rappers must be on that Lindsay Lohan
I think that snow bunny got 'em open
Your 'erb smell funny and I funny like we jokin'
Look, if it ain't about this money, don't approach 'em
If you do try and play, I got a K that can coach 'em
Pen game, poke 'em like an inmate in foursome
I'm for that, it's nothin' like a doormat, you're welcome
Huh, shout-out to Jadakiss and French
I got two French vanillas French kissin', that's a pimp
If my goon don't stretch 'em wit' the weapon, that's a ten
Little meth in your possession, that's possession wit' intent, bruh
It's a hard knock life, but we find a way
And we still find the time to write a rhyme a day
I'm tryin' to send my babies to college
Why you rappers babysittin' your pockets?
I want your life or your wallet
Brr, that's the sound of the roscoe
Mexicans is vatos, skinny jeans is flacko
That means I'm tight wit' you, I'm ready to fight wit' you
Please, and that don't mean I'm tryin' to be polite wit' you
Nah, see, I ain't even try and griped wit' you
So take your team if they ain't tryin' to lose they life wit' you
Back down while I'm puttin' this MAC down
But only for a limited time, homie, so act now
Bruh, keep it a hundred and a Backwood
Who else could think on an empty stomach? I'm that good
Far from the slave ship, just far from basic
Started from the basement, now we're y'all replacements
Rap star Belly, magazine, who sixteen?
Son, you all ready, headshot, all beggin'
Man in the myth, take a stand, any stand on the Fifth
I'm tryin' to hold it down, I hold the Clan
Get a grip, Lord, from this jump I got my hand on the ripcord
And I ain't tryin' to bite the hand off your bit Ford
Now y'all done got the Method Man on some rich border
I'm gettin' paid and I'm full
Y'all sheep for the wolves, we gon' eat 'til we good
Y'all don't speak when you should, ain't no peace in my hood[Intro]
Yeah, that's right everybody get some act right"

[Verse 1]
Awww shit! Ya know the name
Who flip flows like chessboards, there go the games
I'm drugs to the brain
Even on the 14th of February I ain't got no love for a lame
Back doin' my thang, right
Livin' the fast life
Bitch grab a seat at the bar, get you some act right
If that don't do it then rock, lets bring it back like
(Damn right everybody get some act right)
Ever since I came up, rappers done changed up
Put your walking shoes back on and step your game up
I'm getting through off the books, rock we banked up
Y'all don't think my shit off the hook, then y'all can hang on
I'm like a king that's so fresh so clean
I leave niggas like black coffee, no cream
Come inside the party fuck up the whole scene
(That's right everybody get some act right)

[Hook]
Get up get up, ya know what we came here for
What up what up, get your asses out on the floor
Come on come on, I've been away for far too long
Guess who's back and far too strong for ya niggas (now)
We feelin' good tonight, we hittin' 'dro like
We gettin money and gettin' honeys that flow like
My mic, my clothes, my life, my dough
(That's right everybody get some act right)

[Verse 2]
Ya damned if you do, ya damned if you don't
Step inside my Range and get blammed if you won't
My Clan in the joint, man we got it locked
Like whatever niggas got in the bank, I got it stopped
Y'all already know of my strength already growin'
In this game many may come but few are chosen
I don't usually do this, but keep the party going like
(Damn right everybody get some act right)
I get tips from B.I.G. and Pac when they blastin' the heat
If you's a rapper, don't ever ride the passenger seat
One to grow on
When up shit's creek, you get your roll on
Boy I never stop, I go on, so on and so on
Rappers can't fuck with me
My career's like somebody put glue in your chair and now you're stuck with me
I don't use pick up lines, I guess I'm just picky
(That's right everybody get some act right)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Extra, extra read all about it
Who shits they grounded, flies all around it
My trees don't doubt it, they green as a salad
All American Express I never leave home without it
I'll never go pop, Meth Man I'm bout it
Whenever I rock, the jam's over crowded
I'm never gonna stop, the fans won't allow it
(Damn right everybody get some act right)
Yo, get it you got it, if you got it then good
(There's a lot of rappers rappin' but not a lot of 'em could)
I'm that boy in the hood that told Red Riding Hood
There ain't nothin' but wars in my neck of the woods
So! Who's ready for MC Whoa
What's beef? Beef is what I got teeth for
I eat up everything on my plate then eat yours like
(That's right everybody get some act right)

[Hook]

[Outro]
Stand up! Staten Island, Lond Island get some act right
Every borough, New Jersey get some act right
Each state, west coast, east coast, dirty south, midwest get some act right
If it ain't well, it ain't right
If it ain't Meth, it ain't tight
So on that note like this, everybody get some act right[Intro: Method Man]
Damn... yo, yo

[Method Man]
Woke up in the morning, like ten A.M
Walked passed the Listerine, went straight for the gin
Osama Bin Laden on my chinny chin chin

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, Meth, the mailman!

[Method Man]
Yo, Ghost, let him in!

[Ghostface Killah]
Will you sign, Mr. Ghostface, package for a friend, here
Right by the X, my bad, here's a pen

[Method Man]
Gucci flip flops, I box my way to the kitchen
My keys is missin', my trees is missin'
No more parties, cuz Doc need to listen

[Ghostface Killah]
Cuz something in my closet, go look (he's a pissin')
I cursed this bitch out, we be laid back

[Method Man]
Half a box of cereal gone, my milk's warm
Thta's wrong, this is John John, pro and con phenomenon
Stretch with a morning yawn, party 'til the break of dawn
Ladies throw your faces on, sing it when the break come on

[Hook: Method Man (Ghostface Killah)]
Ichi, ni, san, shi
Boats (suites) dough (beats)
No cat give you these, rap flow triple g's
Meth, Ghost, Killa Beez, you know we ride

[Ghostface Killah]
Wu-Tang, the best rap group of all time
Rush little shotgun, rest around nine
Refrigerator, fish and sweets with no swine
Dirty and Meth guest room with four dimes
And U-G. had a Masta headache
Him and Genius flew back from, Uganda black, gettin' that cake
Where Divine at? Wine at
Tell a DJ to rewind that, Killa killed it wit a blind back
Dime sack, you know we blew that wit the cognac
Them bowling ball lead head niggas, we call them pawn yacks

[Method Man]
I say my girl, like to party all the time, Ghost
Spend up my ends, every week, she always cryin' broke
Thank God it's friday, I just got paid
Feelin' good like I just got laid
The next drink's on me, instead of, oh God, you think O.G
White girls they comin' out, like they Pink on E
So you better get the party started, we get it crunk regardless
We got the 'dro and hypnotic, them kids is puffin' garbage
Is where it's crackin' at, Street is you passin' that?
Mami's is grabbin' ass, Johnny, I'm grabbin' back
You know my habitat, you know my peoples
If you wit me, where you at
There ain't nothin' compared to that, come on!

[Hook: Method Man (Ghostface Killah)]
Ichi, ni, san, shi
Boats (suites) dough (beats)
No flows ill as these, M and Ghost, nigga please
Meth, Ghost, Killa Beez, you know we ride

[Hook 2X: Method Man (Ghostface Killah)]
I got me some Seagram's gin
Everybody got they cup, but they ain't chipped in
(These cheap muthafuckas be grown ass men
Tight muthafuckas finish your shit then they bounce off with them)
Come back again, drunk off your gin
And when they try to get you for they ends, that's no friend
That's no friend, eh, eh

[Outro: Method Man]
Yeah, greedy muthafuckas, always wanna get high
But never wanna buy, first one to come to the party
Last one to leave, man, fuck all that
Aiyo, Mr. Streetlife, tell 'em where we come from man..[Hook: Method Man]
You're all that I need, I'll be there for you
If you keep it real with me, I'll keep it real with you
Loving your whole steez, it be in there boo
On top of that you got the good power-U

[Verse One: Method Man]
Shorty I'm there for you anytime you need me
For real girl, it's me in your world, believe me
Nothing make a man feel better than a woman
Queen with a crown that be down for whatever
There are few things that's forever, my lady
We can make war or make babies, back when I was nothing
You made a brother feel like he was something
That's why I'm with you to this day boo no frontin'
Even when the skies were gray
You would rub me on my back and say "Baby it'll be okay"
Now that's real to a brother like me baby
Never ever give my pussy away, and keep it tight aight
And I'mma walk these dogs so we can live
In a fat ass crib with thousands of kids
Word life, you don't need a ring to be my wife
Just be there for me I'm a make sure we
Be livin' in the fucking lap of luxury
I'm realizing that you didn't have to fuck with me
But you did, now I'm going all out kid
And I got mad love to give, you my nigga

[Hook: Method Man (x2)]

[Verse Two: Method Man]
I got a Love Jones for your body and your skin tone
Five minutes alone I'm already on the bone
Plus I love the fact you got a mind of your own
No need to shop around you got the good shit at home
Even if I'm locked up North you in the world
Rockin' three-fourths of cloth never showin' your stuff off, boo
It be true me for you that's how it is
I can be your Knower, you can be my Wiz
Then I can be your Sun, you can be my Earth
Resurrect the God through birth
Best believe

[Hook: Method Man (x2)]Yo, welcome
This is MC sharper image
I'm standing here with my dog technology
And we are here to uplift you mind
And upgrade your systems
So come on down everyone that wants to get some
Plug in and boot, and boot

[Method Man]
Yo, Yo, I couldn't give a rat's ass
I've come to eat grub and slap ass
And show my whole entire black ass
Y'all know the saying he who laughs last laughs loudest
Bang the loudest, can't a coward do a thing 'bout it
What the bum-ba claat like "aye carumba"
Here's my name and number, lets "La Rhumba"
Doc, it makes me wonder; how many heads has Heather Hunter's
How many different conclusions to come to
And my sixteen bars meth, hittin' too hard
With a total disregard for whole entourage
Rap phenom, slap your ass, snap your thong to my theme song
And hope you don't get clap upon
Who that kid, as dirty as that Ol' Dirty Bastard
Who that kid, who pack a tool belt and dirty belt and dirty ratchet
Set your tape recorder, lock down your daughter
Soon as a touch the rap game, out of order

[Redman]
Do I get brollic
Gimme that car ill show you how to flip mileage
Gimme that mic, ill short it with a quick wattage
Skip college for the big wallet
The ape with a fire escape from the weight of a hit product
My draft is cold like miller beer
When you hear it, you see more stars than tigger's cheer
The red nigga here, and its out of control
Something like when Ron Gold' went out with Nicole
I'll bring it back to the streets where the crooks belong
And if it ain't come back raw, you cooked it wrong
Gangsta bomb, hold your nose
At the show, ill be shittin' out my mouth like my colon closed
Me and meth, 100 proof, in case y'all a biter
And ovaries, feel these great ball of fire
(Doc, where the lighter) I'm hemming them up
Coffee grind them and put them in a vanilla dutch

[Hook] (with America's' most after the end of each line)
Believe that, the brothers in the house now be that
Believe that, lets turn the mother out now, be that
Beback , that what it all about now ,be that
We not playin' (knowwhatinsayn' sonsayin)
Believe that, the brothers in the house now be that
Believe that, lets turn the mother out now, be that
Beback , that what it all about now ,be that
Fuck with the meth(knowwhatinsayn' sonsayin)

[Method Man]
I'm looking at you killers like you stole something, fuck ya life
Trust my niggas, sometimes for I trust my wife
Fuck it, I'm nice, y'all don't be rushing the mic
With your guns in your left hand
Not bustin' it right
Ain't no I in the team
Ain't no eyen' my cream
I'm a semi-auto, clean
Rapid-fire machine
Cocky, six foot three with knock knees
Attract hoodrats for blocks cause I got cheese

[Redman]
Yo, dude I carry cheese, but I don't flaunt it
When the towel it thrown it, you know there's grown men that spoke on it
We both want it, the Trackmasters
Puncturing holes in the beat when a vocal tone poke on it
Barbaric, my caddie truck beyond average
With the same size wheels that on a horse carriage
Up in the air , spot my dudes
Rollin' over shit like B. Rhymes on mountain dew

[Hook] - repeat 2X***Chorus*** (x2)
Fuck y'all analog niggas we be digital
Wu-Tang, Killarmy we indespensible
We never fall
We stand tall like sky-scrapers and justice for all

[Killa Sin]
We move on MC's mechanically
Strike nerves like Ghost's verse on 'Can It Be'
Hard to touch retarded fucks playing wit they fantasies
Respect this, specialist, black
Testing this will get ya necklace jacked
And named scratched up off my guestlist party freak
You the type of nigga that'll hardly speak unless you spoken to
You throw a cold screw, but sober up when I'm approaching you
At the same time we posting two
Niggas on that ass that's gonna do what they supposed to do
The limelight, snatched away from you because it's my night
Killarm blaze inside of the twilight, you better get ya lines right
Half of these crabs can't even rhyme right
With dust flows, robotic movement, and blurry eyesights
What you want I already got
And that's control, I keep my head high, hand pon cock
And pockets swollen, you foldin, you faggot ass fuck

[Dom Pachino]
Yo farotion never fails
Shoot at darts sharper than a carpenters nail
Inhale life, exhale strive anxiety's trife
Blowin' smoke out my peace pipe
Ducking the snipe
Shot off the top of the White House and cop 4'S
War never does and many causes
My offense is my defense extreme precautious
Moving cyphers high valocities making you nautious
Ya forcing it
Parishly extortionists
Aborting this
Space ship thats spacious face it
Im on contain shit
Pioneer looking for honey and is it matrix
The case is
If not ya basic
Way to make shit
Embrace it
Knowing some day you'll have to face it

***Chorus***
Fuck y'all analog niggas we be digital
Wu-Tang, Killarmy we indespensible
We never fall
We stand tall like sky-scrapers and justice for all
(so fuck y'all, so fuck y'all niggas)

[Bobby Digital]
Yo, yo hard to grapple
I raise the sharp scaple
Technique slaps you invasion body snatch you money grip
I smoke the honey dip blunts cherry bomb very calm
First bursts like a shot from the Berry homes
You'd be most wise to pay close attention
To willy lynchin'
Its stupid to fuck wit' Bobby Steel's henchmen
I step into presidential
Credentials, evident my potential
Be infinate, deluxe benetic sluts invinsible
Only ones can know me
Swore me before the Dolby
Alexis Colby broads try to control me
Pussy whip me like Toby
Fuck the local
I move global
Economical
Ship sea promise fool
My info glow
And the dark Wu-Tang logo
Sparks the attention, look listen observe
Killa bee swerv
Slam like Dr. Julias Erv
Still strike the vital nerve
Charter through the Magna Carta
Trapped like Otis and Carter
Wild like a Shaolin child from Mariners Harbor
King devine forced to shine
Head burst open like a bottle of Pine
Use penmenship
When I write my script
Blunt spark em' and them mark em' homeless
Killa Hill syndrome
Peace to Two Tone
He must know me to understand me from what you do
To realize Im you
Everything I do honey bee from the bee hive
Ever-green squeeze dried leaf smoke Killa Priest from the tribe
Of Levi smoke out and not steal
Or blunt spill
The indestructable Bobby Steele's is here

[Method Man]
Yo In The Heat of The Night
My 4-7-7 Mash on the mic
Killarmy and Trappa John M.D
Full metal jackets
Cuz' some gots to have it
Kill or be killed
Only time will reveal
I think by myself
And I drink by myself
From 9-8 until
Let me know its real son if its really real
Understandable
Self explainable
Caution John Blaze flamable
When under pressure, interchangable and still
Coming down like precipitation as I reign undesputed
How Johnny do it
Dangerously, whoppin cough (cough, cough)
Two and off
Stank pussy make my dick soft (huh)
Bottom line be this high, explosive
Not for the average Joseph
Come and get some
Hol' it, keep one
Up in the chamber
Blast wit' my middle finger
9 Swordsmen
Attack like the Four Horsemen
See me dog walkin'
Strickly getty-o slang talkin'
All up in thease guts, soften
Thease rap niggas, official
We slap niggas
Wit' mak' charges
Dope shit regardless
We usually take another niggas garments (what)

[Killarmy]
Straight up and down I got this rap shit locked in '98
Niggas can't escape the laws that I enforce like top notch politicians
Who be pola-tickin'
Slam through expand total construction accross the planet and micro chip software
Placed in the rear of ya ear
As I sit the next year
All yall analong niggas fuck yall we be digital
Shit is critical
Like the hallways in my projects
Similar to the streets in Tibet
Fuck that I ain't playin' wit' a full deck (son, son, son, son)[Intro: Method Man]
Uh.. that's right, oh yeah
Back with some nasty shit, right there
Nasty, nasty, girl, nasty girl, baby come on

[Method Man]
Pretty young thing like to bone
And she hate to spend her nights alone, baby doll you in the zone
Why not call me on the phone, and invite me home
Come on, now, baby, come on-on
Know what I mean, take a real queen to fuck with me
Trustin' me, and give it up for free
Next time, feel free to hit me up, anything you wanna puff a tree
Come on, now, baby, come on-on
Whats shaking yo, stop stallin', what you waitin' for?
You know we both ain't got no place to go
So roll it up, and lay low
Everytime I say, yes, baby, you say no
Come on, now, baby, come on-on
Now-now, now-now-now, you don't have to stay
It's ok, there's the dough, you can walk away, why make we wait
Til tomorrow, when you can break me off today
Come on, now, baby, come on-on

[Hook: Kardinal Offishall]
Yeah! Gal dem we love, and gal we need

[Method Man]

Cuz I never let it walk on by, or any slice of the american pie
Come on, now, baby, come on-on
Girlfriend, you know it's half past two A.M
You got a friend, but you ain't really trynna fuck with him
Aight, then, hit up Batty, I'll gladly come and tuck you in
Come on, now, baby, come on-on
Scream at your frog, all's fair, love & basketball
She remind me of this chick that used to fuck with Dirty Bastard, ya'll
Heard that she could suck a ball through a plastic straw
Come on, now, baby, come on-on
Know what I'm sayin', kid, she get it poppin' off and half the time
A little, candlelight, a little glass of wine
I'm thinkin', another drink and that ass is mine
Come on, now, baby, come on-on

[Hook]

[Method Man]
If you girl come knockin' at my door, it's my duty
To give her what she came here for
I'm try'nna knock it down, but I ain't try'nna claim that dough
Come on, now, baby, come on-on
That's what's up, start the fire, Buddha, light things up
The only nigga puttin' ends on some rims for his ice cream truck
Pick a flavor, I'll come and scoop your whole team up
Come on, now, baby, come on-on
That's how it be, don't trip, but girl you put a hurtin' on me
Oh shit, hope other chicks don't take it personally
But ma, you killin' her, murder in the first degree
Come on, now, baby, come on-on
Okay, okay, can the ladies come out and play with Mr. Meth
I ain't trynna take you out your way
Why break me off tomorrow, when you can break me off today
Come on, now...

[Hook]

[Outro: Method Man]

Aight
Rap City Tha Bassment, Big Tig', EQ, Method Man hey
Method Man hey
It's going down, check it out one time
Off the top I guarantee there's no equal
His new album in stores - Tical 0, man, The Prequel
You know how we do when me and my crew bang
Been rapping this kid, since he was down with Wu-Tang
Back in the days, into the chamber 36
Big Tig' putting it down in dirty mix, provided by EQ
Test me and my crew, guarantee you lose
Man your whole crew snoozed
Meth, Tical, standing behind me right now
You know how we do, we keep it moving with freestyle
I'ma step to the right, you blow the spotlight
Dynamite, hey man come on and make it right

[Verse 2: Method Man]
Yeah, Mr. Meth AKA John John phenomenon
AKA Alicia Keys boyfriend in the video, here we go
Yo, yo, yo, oh shit lo and behold
Rza and Meth got another ninja scroll
Man I injure foes, send chills down their spines
Like I'm December cold, never bend or fold
Like a wallet. Can't call it, can't pretend to know
Whack shit, turn my back on it like a friend that stole
Been in the game ten years, I got ten to go
It's the prince and the dark knight let's begin day-O
Call me mister low maintenance
Tell them ho's I'm like a doctor that lost his license
I got no patients, I got time for wasting
If you ain't fam you ain't relating
These hating hot dog rappers is baking
Without love, like a stoner without bud
Your ass is as flat as a soda without suds
Who got the nerve to think that Meth can't rhyme
Put a nine to your skull and get that out your mind, mind
Yes! Uh oh! Like Lumi Dee
If Meth ain't that shit by now I'm soon to be
When I choke hold mics I don't give'em room to breathe
I'm just doing me, but girl if you're fine I'll do you free
By now if you don't know who it be, don't make me tell
Just know I killer Mike like that kid from ATL
If you fail to plan, baby plan to fail
See my game ugly ... like Sam Cassel
I'm so funky I can't even stand the smell
Come on, life's a drag, roll it up and inhale
Don't get comfy, I cramp your style like a monthly
Even Demi Moore need more than Ashton Kutcher to punk me
My 4-5 bars, just one shot'll clear the block
Like it's time for 106 & Park
Staten Island dropping your ass, we mean business
My gun'll put a shot in your ass
Like free clinics* also appears on the Method Man and Redman album "Blackout!"

I make it hard for MC's to run neck and elbow
With D-O, penal code, Deebo knows
To duck when he hear the bike, wit the squeaky clutch
Swallow this hard act to follow
You could parachute off my slang and use my, rhymes to toggle
I'm tense, so smooth I can't be fingerprinted
I stomp harder in slow motion.. den, den-den-den
Yo, fuck your applaud, bitches still rush me

[E-Dub] Ohh, yeah yeah[Intro: Ginuwine]
Yeah, *humming*, listen baby

[Hook 2X: Ginuwine]
Uh huh, baby I got big plans
The big ring, the small hand
A big cake, a bridesmaid, a best man
One day, we gon' have all that

[Ginuwine]
Girl I know we just met tonight
And this may seem like a lie
But, I'm not the player type
Guess what? Normally you wouldn't find me
Under the crowd of lights, in search of a love in life
But you shakin' that stuff right
I think I should make you my wife

[Hook 2X]

[Ginuwine]
You probably think I'm tryin' crush tonight
Cuz I got a look of lust, like crust in my eye
No matter what I say, keep it tight
Keep it away from me like Superman and kryptonite
You see I'm not thinkin' short term, I've learned
Givin' everybody turns, can I like a back burn
Oh, you got this lover wanna beg to earn, oh baby

[Hook 2X]

[Ginuwine]
I know it sounds boo, I ain't even known you two
Days and I'm open to, the point that I propose to you
Must think I'm some kind of fool, don't you
You can call it what you're thinkin'
But I'm thinkin' we gon' jump that broom

[Method Man]
Back-seat of my jeep, let's swing an episode
Her neck and wrist all froze, I'm trynna catch a cold
Clippin' the trey, we sippin' away
On that 'Ze, innovations, slowin' slippin' away
Ain't life funny, don't nothin' move but that money
Oh boy, honeys, lookin' like Playboy bunnies
They whole swagger, that be the type that I go after
That get more attention cuz they ass is more fatter
And every day gotta have a, but I ain't trynna make her unconfy
Or cramp her style like a monthly
How many women want a man, with big plans
Big feet and big hands, ya'll understand
Why big daddy wear the big pants, I'm big boned
And if this symbolizes my life, I live long
My funny valentine, won't you be mine
Fifty grand on the wedding band, let it G-Wine

[Hook 2X][Intro:]
What? What you want?
Represent represent represent
Yeah, represent, check it out check it out

Yo mama don't wear no drawers!
I saw her when she took them off!
Standing on the welfare line
Eating swine trying to look fine, with her stank behind
You can ask the bitch and she'll tell ya fast
Meth-Tical got STYLE with his nasty ass

[Verse One:]
Are you ready, to face the consequences and suffer?
I even tell ya momma you ain't shit, motherfucker
Bring it, and let that killer bee kid sting it
And rep-resent, it's like heads up a brick, when I swing it
Get lost, I break you off something
I'm pumping, like a Reebok, with a pump, from the jump and
You was nothing
Bet you thought you fucking clan had ya back but they was fronting
Smoking dirt blunts and fucking nasty sluts and
You just a naked gun without the bullet, what you busting
Get your ship sunken, fucking with a drunken
Master disaster at any rap functions

[Interlude:]
Just an echo, yoo-hoo
We be living in the valley yoo-hoo
It may be difficult to bring back
Sweet memories of you
And you can even ask your crew
Bet your bottom dollar that they tell ya fast
Meth-Tical got STYLE with his nasty ass

[Verse Two:]
Who said the Wu-Tang Clan? Was it you or your man?
You wanna point the finger, I'll bring ya
36 chambers, be out, you'se in danger
Let me pull your brain out your ass with a hanger
Didn't momma not tell ya not to talk to a stranger
Now ya got ya neck, in the noose, of the strangler
Just recline, keep the Meth in mind
I'll even test the knuckle check on the hands of time
What? And I'll be more than glad to bust that ass
All up and down the block, the street, that ave
Whatever, smoking on a Spike Lee joint
Hey I'm Mo' Better, I'm hoping niggas get the point
Cause they could never, stop the veteran, word to God
When I'm severing the head of a mental vegetarian
The Method, at the weekend, with a whole lot of credit
If you desire fire, I be the first to set it
Off, flame on like the Human Torch
Fantastic Four for all the fans in the store
You can eat it all and it'll tell you fast
Meth-Tical got STYLE for your nasty ass

[Outro:]

Keep that heat and the John Lennon
Boy you won't catch me arguin'
Brick City, that's right! Hood down, hands up!
Red "Lord of the Ring," clean, lookin' for that Precious
I'm talking weed and women, when the trouble come I'm 'bout it
Shit I'd rather get caught with my gun then get caught without it
It's Gilla House nigga, you know we here to smoke
DJ keep it Kool, Reggie let me UH-HAH clear my throat
When I'm in yo' town man', you better act a fool
Turn your college dorm to Rodney Dangerfield- Back to School!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ready Roc]
'Round here we blow treez (blow treez)
'Til our nose bleed
Started with a quarter then slowly smoked up a O-Z
Ready keep it raw like a nigga ordered a whole ki'
"Nigga let me hit ya blunt" Nah, you don't know me
Gilla! Gilla House and Gotti click
Bang like karate flicks
Duck when the shotty spit
Or land in a pile of shit
Known to make you cowards bleed
Smokin' on that Sour Dies'
That cali weed's
So funky we call it cottage cheese
I'm in the powered V-12
Look at all these females
Jockin' me cuz of all the records that we sell
Got them pounds for retail
Hit me on my email
And drop bombs dot com, yo who need L's?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Method Man]
Yo, yo my bud'll do ya

Occasional boozer

Fuck everybody that knew ya

Your crimi-nal pen pal kidnapped Loud, jetted the

Rollin wax style museum, G 'em

Slide the hatchback, black were finessing this
Them niggas over there know, Gazelle goggles
And them Lottos, 88 style, throwin' bottles (bottles)
Scenario rap, rap imperial, material (uh, yo yo, yo, yo)
Murderin' cats is like that real

[Verse Two: Ghostface]
Yo come do me somethin word to Michelob peep the Land Rov'
Sleeper hold club faggots lay your dome on a stove
It's like space kid, the whole world is pitch black, granola rap
Dough got smaller famous team, walked up in Fotomat
Black down, numerous rounds, boots is brown
Getaway driver, this white bitch from out of town
We love horse races shakin Jakes and high-speed chases
Porno stations, drinkin violations, godly nations
90 minute Maxell tapes, instrumental breaks
Bangin earaches, lay my verse down in two takes
The speaker pops, the Winchester rifle's in the kitchen
Murder the DJ's eyes twitchin, woofer hissin

[Interlude: Raekwon]
Yo, he's strong armin, manipulatin niggas, scrapin niggas
Takin play from niggas, hate fakin niggas, yo you hear me?
The whole shit's like wrestling
What you dare me? Back the fuck up kid, we flexin

[Verse Three: Method Man]
This rap shit bust yo' gums, and leave you stunned
Pull your plug, now you can't function
There's no to-tal or sum to this equa-tion, you fro-zen
Many may come but few are cho-sen
Pretty niggas want to play the war po-sin
When the ruckus come, they be the first to get their shine stolen
Do or die, it be I, Meta-physical Man
Holding court from my Wu, indivisible clan
I see your thoughts and your hand reachin
It's getting deep in this mud
Cats heat seekin, for one blood
Nameless thugs with aimless slugs, shootin at these stank bitches
Less he gon' bring this above, I make switches
From the lamp I grant three wishes
Johnny be parlayin, I Blaze britches, then I roll
One hundred percent mind, one hundred percent body
One hundred percent soul, individual
Assholes tend to run
From this PLO extortion to the one
The next chamber, you fuckin with the star spangler
To the dawn's early light with this head-banger
Boogie, represent this shit fully
Like I'm constantly at war with the town bully
Who want that pressure, about to get smacked silly
Like a fat bitch in Spandex, free Willy!
We on some milli, check the joint, engine number nine
Niggas wastin time worryin about me and mine
Get your own shit[Method Man]
You and I, 'til the day we die.. (day we die..)

Yo, yo
Ex-girlfriend, how you been? I see you still
Tryin to fuck with other women
Men, remember when
I first met you in my cousin's house, a week later
We was fuckin on your
Momma couch, now it's been said
That big girls they don't cry, but they damn sure lie
Look you in the eye, sayin you they only
You and I, til the day we die, said you'd never
Leave me lonely, fly tenderoni but you phony
Shoulda listened when my momma told me, soon as I
Turn my back you try to fuck my homies, that was then
This is now I got a new friend, ever since
I cut them loose ends you wanna bone me
Add strife to my life, pussy that'll make me think twice
About leavin the wife even, picture that
You ain't want me when you had me, now you on
Your third baby daddy, and you hate to see a nigga happy
So you tryin mad ways to trap me, lookin at my girl nasty
Tryin to throw the pussy at me

"Now look at this bitch over here tryin to act like me"
"Uh-huh, fuck that bitch, she what wifey leftover"

[D'Angelo]
I'm still lovin you babe (8X)

[Method Man]
Yo yo

Let me find out that you fuckin with Boo, and y'all gon' feel it
Waitin for the day that you front, and catch a lump
From my black butterfly, that don't pack a lullaby
Sleep on her, she said you bitches tried to creep on her
In the mall and
Didn't know she had the reach on her
Pearl-handled twenty-two, my Boo
She go ahead and walk her dogs, and represent Wu
To the fullest, you and hon can shoot the fair one

Mad love but get no love nigga?? Stupid ass
Plus I heard that he be beatin on you, I seen him
At the club cheatin on you
Witcha best friend, got you stressin
And used up, pull your shoes up, all you need's affection
But you're headed in the wrong direction
Tryin to make this nigga jealous, with other fellas
All up in my face actin overzealous
Like you want somethin from Meth, I hope it ain't love girl
Cause I ain't got
None left for you, plus you miserable
Misery Love Company, shit I'm livin comfortably, don't need no
Nigga huntin me down for fuckin round, with his kitty
Talk to him, before my brother put a spark through him
Won't be pretty, the situation got my whole attitude shitty
And got you actin high saditty with your slut committee
You know I know; so go find another sucker yo, I been there
And been done that befo', and don't need it no mo'
That's, my, word! So go to your own with that there, word up

Crunk just like a party
Ohh, you won't be sorry
My papi, I'm yo' mami

[Missy]
I'm in your life to come and let you explore {HA?}
And take you on a tour
The kind of guys that be talkin that noise
Is the reason I ignore {UH-HA!}
And you the one I wanna take to MEET MOMS
"He's a rap superstar" {UH-HA!}
I wanna be the one, you like
I'm sure to do you right

[Method Man] + (Missy)
Is it real hon, if it's really real (let's chill)
Maybe pop an X pill (how does sex feel?)
Come and get your next thrill (you the raw deal)
Yo I'm sayin if your man won't (Mr. Meth will)
That's amore', all day, mind over matter
And my forte' is foreplay, sex on a platter
Have it your way, then who, serve you everything on the menu
And all that freak shit that you into
Sweet lady, you drive me half crazy
Maybe, we can go half on a baby (on a baby?)
Poppa got a brand new bag
Hidden in the stash of his brand new Jag
Lovely, kick your shoes off and get comfy
We can bump uglies if you ain't got your monthly
Yes I, like "American Pie"
Tell 'em M-I-crooked letter-crooked letter-Y

M-E-T-H-O-D, Man
M-I-S-S-Y, I am
I came came to bang bang the boogie
I see you lookin to bang out my nookie
You want my cookies I baked for you rookies
Work hard they want me to bang bang and stick me
If you want my nookie you got to come quickly
M-E-T-H-O-D is ya wit me?
(Mr. Meth) is ya wit me?
