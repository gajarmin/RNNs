[Hook: 2D]
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine, in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on

[Verse 1: Del]
Finally, someone let me out of my cage
Now, time for me is nothing cause I'm countin' no age
Nah, I couldn't be there, now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs, and I'm under each snare
Intangible, bet you didn't think so I command you to
Panoramic view, look, I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose, sit and lose, all you different crews
Chicks and dudes, who you think is really kickin' tunes
Picture you getting down in a picture tube
Like you lit the fuse, you think it's fictional
Mystical? Maybe, spiritual
Hero who appears in you to clear your view when you're too crazy
Lifeless to know the definition for what life is
Priceless to you because I put you on the hype shit
You like it? Gun smokin', righteous with one toke
Psychic among those, possess you with one go

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Del]
The essence, the basics, without it you make it
Allow me to make this, childlike in nature
Rhythm, you have it or you don't, that's a fallacy
I'm in them, every sprouting tree, every child o' peace
Every cloud and sea, you see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise, corruption in disguise (that's right)
From this fucking enterprise, now I'm sucked into your lies
Through Russel, not his muscles, but the percussion he provides
With me as a guide, y'all can see me now cause you don't see with your eye
You perceive with your mind
That's the inner, so I'mma stick around with Russ and be a mentor
Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember
Where the thought is, I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless
Feelings, sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing, and remember: that it's all in your head

[Hook][Intro]
Ahh, I know I'm drunk now
Ladies and gentlemen, I for-I forgot my
My favorite man, sittin' over there
His name is...

[Hook]
Mista Dobalina, Mr. Bob Dobalina
Mista Dobalina, Mr. Bob Dobalina
Mista Dobalina, Mr. Bob Dobalina
Mista Mista Dobalina, Mr. Bob Dobalina

Mista Dobalina, Mr. Bob Dobalina
Mista Dobalina, Mr. Bob Dobalina
Mista Dobalina, Mr. Bob Dobalina
Mr. Bob Dobalina

[Verse 1]
Mista Dobalina, Mista Bob Dobalina
Mista Bob Dobalina, won't you quit?
You really make me sick with ya fraudulent behavior
You're gonna make me flip and then an army couldn't save ya
Why don't you behave ya little rugrat?
Take a little tip from the tabloid, because I know I'm not paranoid
When I say I saw ya tryin' to mock me
Now you and your crew are on a mission tryin' to hawk me
But it isn't happenin' ya fraudulent foes
You used to front big time now I suppose
That everything's cool since the style of apparel you adopted
You used to make fun of but now you wanna rock it
So you gotta kick it with the homies
But D-E-L is already hip to your cronies
Me and CM-PX thought about this and never have we seen a
Brother who could hover Mista, Mista, Mista Dobalina

[Hook]

[Bridge 1]
Gloryhallastoopid, Mista Bob Dobalina
Gloryhallastoopid, Mista Bob Dobalina
Gloryhallastoopid, Mista Bob Dobalina
Gloryhallastoopid, Mista Bob Dobalina

[Bridge 2]
Ooh, ooh, Mista Dobalina, you thought ya could manipulate
You thought you could fool me, ooh, ooh, Mista Dobalina
Teacher used to put me on a stump
And then he schooled me

[Verse 2]
Friends can be fraudulent, just you wait and see
First he was my moneygrip then he stole my honeydip
Mista Dobalina is a serpent, don't you agree?
The little two-tima resembles Aunt Jemima
With jeans and a dirty white hoodie
Seems like he wouldn't be a snake or would he?
Disguises come in all sizes and shapes
Notice the facade of the snakes
They all catch the vapes, even though last year they was GQ
Took a lot of time before the D-E-L could see through
The mask, all I had to do was ask Hemperor and Kwamé
And my man responded they would bomb a
Fraudulent foe with the strength of Hercules
The way ya on my dick must really hurt ya knees
You need to take heed and quit being such a groupie
Ever since I did a little show in Guadeloupee
I neva saw a groupie like you
But what is funny is ya wanted to be down with my crew
But D-E-L is not down with any clowns or jesters
So I would suggest that you try to impress Uncle Fester, Dobalina
Because ya don't impress me Dobalina
The style of dress is not the key Dobalina
It's all in the mind and the heart, so you should start
By remembering ya gotta pay a fee Dobalina

[Hook]

[Bridge 1]

[Hook][Verse 1]
It's important to practice good hygiene
At least if you wanna run with my team
I'm bout to get into some shit that I've seen
This fool's breath ferment, so bad it'll melt your ice cream
They say don't say nothing if you can't say nice things
Sittin too close to him on BART, like my eyes stings
I try to be subtle, hand him a stick of gum
I was a victim of breath on hum
Running his yap about what sets he from
Gotta get some gum gotta get him some
He turned it down, his teeth was brown
Excruciating, foreign, it was a new sensation
I had to ask the dope to pass the soap
Cuz his coat had the sniff of crustaceans
Or bathrooms in a bus station
He had a can of Olde E and some raisins
Amazing... head to toe B.O
He didn't know, used to the fragrance
Just as the days went without bathing
He felt manly and not like a maiden
He had one dread, and fungus
Said he worked on peoples' toilets with plungers
Girls, not the guy you would want to tongue ya
So guys take your cue from this number

[Hook]
You gotta wash your ass, if you must
You gotta wash your hair, if you must
You gotta brush your teeth, if you must
Or else you'll be funky

[Verse 2]
Now at class you need total concentration
But there's kids in the back holdin conversations
Crackin on each other, and neither were poster boys
Both of em smell like the type that soap avoids
Coast and Joy, they leave their absence
One's fool's feet smelled like it struck some matchsticks
Brimstone, girls would never bring him home
I was laughin, then his friend raised his tone
And said, "Bud you hurled all over yourself" "yeaaa"
I go so deep on your ass, it be submerged
Like you need to deal with water cuz you smell like a turd
Wanna cap get some courage, your feet smell lurid
Well look it up
And while you're at it, get a cup
And squeeze the sweat out your sweatshirt and drink it or gargle
You get our vote for most stinkiest
That nigga started thinkin of shit, said I was frail
I said he was stale
Underarms is ripe
Undergarments tight, about to leap out your holy sweats
And we holdin bets, and after this I'm gonna collect
Nigga check, yourself
Respect yourself
And wash your mothafuckin body 'fore your sweatshirt melt
Like radioactive, no lady find you attractive
The funk got you captive
You don't need a map bitch

[Hook][Hook]
Life is a blast when you know what you're doin
Best to know what you're doin 'fore your life get ruined
Life is a thrill when your skill is developed
If you ain't got a skill or trade, then shut the hell up

[Verse 1: Del the Funky Homosapien]
My rhymes is like droppin your head on cement
Crackin' it open hopin to make a dent; I'm hell-bent on
Resurrection, per-fection
Lesson #1: rekindle the essence
Rap ain't about bustin caps and fuckin bitches
It's about fluency with rhymin ingenuity
All of this is new to me, see I peep rhymes
With scrutiny, under a microscope I walk a tightrope
A thin line between insanity and sanity
Mixed with a little vanity, boostin the morality
With Hiero hospitality, soon to strike it rich
Like calories, salaries, ahh sounds like a plan
And, I will expand hip-hop as well
Might even kick a little impromptu, to stomp you
Weaklings, speaking things foreign to the human ear
That, you will fear now, whether you like it or not
Blood clots on your little life on the situation
And on the stipulations... the shit you wastin
Time on you pawns, it was planned like that
But we can fight back, like David Horowitz
And say we want no more of this
And put it in a cyrogenic status
Replace it with the latest in technology
Hip-Hop policies that demolish ya follies
Olly olly oxen free, get off of me
You can't see this, your defeatist attitude'll
Get you nowhere fast, I tend to my task cause

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Del]
Don't even start on the next man, let's scan
Your situation, you still have no patience
Flip on niggas, rob niggas, even family
All the way up to your moms -- you can't stand to be
In the house, but when you kicked out you beggin
To come back in then the same old skit happens
You say you rappin but you don't know the essence
Just ho slap and bustin caps is your message
Plus every time I put some scrill down, you steal it
If that's your way of teachin me a lesson I don't feel it
Your raps reflect your life and that's a shame
Cause the way you're soundin, you must think that it's a game
I can see if you came from the ghetto, but you came
From the Meadow -- you really need to let that go
You got no respect for hip-hop, and you tryin to rhyme
Biding your time and I find it a crime
I even tried to bury the hatchet man,cause we all African
You wanna be a rapper? Start practicin', you can't even flow right
Spend most of your time fuckin hoes, getting in fights
Hangin out, with no mission in life
And you're missing your life, and you'll be missing out on life
I won't sweat you for that G you stole
Cause if you're still alive, I'll be there to see you fold
Told ya!

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Del]
You could be a rapper, an actor, a gun clapper
A comedian providing laughter, as a bachelor
A pastor of a chapter, a doctor, a lawyer
A fireman, a hired hand, whether boy or girl
It's your world. your future you control it
Whatever you do early on, is how you mold it
I record it, sold it, told it to you
Mr. Del wouldn't tell you nothin that ain't true, because

[Hook]

Think you're able to label the Hiero sound?
You still haven't found a comparable variable
You think you're able to label the Hiero sound?
You still haven't found a comparable variable
All you marks... YEAH!

This the freshest shit and you know it[Verse 1: Del tha Funkee Homosapien]
I know you like that, you want to try that
It's like a flashback, so shake your ass crack
I got the balls to, rock the salsa
Funk the blues-a, any groove to
Make you move cause, taking you to
Another landscape, it's my mandate
I'm highly animated even though I'm decomposing
So if your feet is frozen, I'mma die to see you roping

[Hook: Del tha Funkee Homosapien]
And when the MC rhyme and the DJ spin
I want y'all to just get down
Now when the MC rhyme and the DJ cutting
I want y'all to just get down
And when the MC rhyme and the DJ spin
I want y'all to just get down
Now when the MC rhyming and the DJ cutting
I want y'all to JUST GET DOWN
Tap your toes and clap your hands
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Come on trace the globe and shake your pants
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Just twist your hip and do the dip
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Come on shake and bake do whatever it takes
(How many people ready to rock the house?)

[Verse 2: Del tha Funkee Homosapien]
Gravitational pull'll have you making a fool
Out of yourself on the dance floor
Doing back spins
Running man and more
Party down with vigor and candor
Coming to the jam or look like a landlubber
And do the aqua boogie, win
Lots of goodies maybe
Pop a Gucci wallet turntables is talking to me
It's awfully groovy, seeing all the treasure and the booty

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Del tha Funkee Homosapien]
I want to get down lower than Atlantis
Going toe to toe with an enchantress
Get funkier than funkadelic wearing Pampers
While you eggheads is on the wall preparing answers
Sharing transcripts, while we over here
Dipping and dancing, rhythm romancing
Wallflowers, giving no action no
All hours we chilling and max the flow
Relaxing, opposites attracting
I'mma toss my hat in, floss when the track spin
Like I'm on a crack bend, jigging and wiggling
Freaking booties
Speaking to the cuties so belligerent
No religion just bump the feed on
You'll feel reborn, negativity we just dead it like decoy
Better lift your feet and just measure the beat on
The pulse when it responds

[Hook][Verse 1: Del the Funky Homosapien aka SIR DZL]
Renovate religiously, imitations ig me
Simply signify on the pygmies
Die hard to the kidneys
Rip through rhythms like Ripley's
Believe it or not, when I weave through the block
Deceitful or not ima leave you distraught
Toddlers fake, bottled drank
Mind boggling walls of debate
Pause and break laws and take the proper spot
Our laws debate, carve and scrape
Border patrol the boarderwalk borders the yo
Ward the flow reflect and the ricochet
Hit the core and explode
No one will know, inside job go with the flow
Spin my bars invite stars ten times large
Solar system can't quiet spark
The revolution has me moving like
A band of Nazis following the hitler
Just swallowing the liquor of the situation
Sicker than the spillited rap agenda
Pen a verse in a hearse windows burst
Cuz shit won't surf
All the way long await
Wanna stay big deal pigs squeal
Furthermore busters eat kids meals
Del Diablo
Model of most bravado
Hallow tip modules
Might hit your car door
Bonfied know to ride
Out like a large boat
Cross the seven seas more drugs like refugees
Insects especially, bugs hide infesting me
Sended much invested but I invested in weaponry
Step to me east toe
Repeat to the beat slow
The mantra
Circle the entree if you want some

[Verse 2: Ladybug Mecca aka Santos Vierira]
Mix some [?] slowly as my light leakers
Like kobe and blinding me like fridged peete
Underfill my wave length
Neta de Santos raizes em Campos
Sórdida
Nada for this gata
Gatisima turn they destruction into pasta
And ingest and spit the eloquentest
Bars ain't[?]
I'm hard to measure, emotional algebra
Making obscure articulate
Leave you like unfinished kiss
Seeking again and again
You been and she a fighter
Set fires till the ending
A passion you can't fathom again
And left straggling, crooked walking
A flash of vertigo

[Verse 3: Kool A.D.]
1990 something Kool intergalactic
Backpack Richmond - slash - El Cerito
See me steelo bro
Lampin like its the Hamptons tho
Swing the John McEnroe
A man a plan a canal panama
That's a palindrome
I don't fuckin know man
I'm rapping
Yo, yo, it's a talent show
Still you gon remember like the Alamo
Alameda calico man yo
I'm magnetizing, magnificent mindset
Telepathic moving through hella traffic
Style's so circular
Thought it was a circle boy
I serve to swerve purses
And hearts from hers towards hearseless avenues
Observe how these words have attitudes that speak platitudes
That bang on your chest like a Jesus piece
And breathe peace and gratitude, but still churchless
But shit I might still run in a Church's Chicken
With a biscuit like, "give me all your chicken and biscuits!"
Shit I might cop a 3D printer and go print up a biscuit
Then rob the chief of police of the city of Richmond
And chief up in the station touching titties and swigging
Up on firebird (thunderbird) listening to Chief Keef
While watching muted youtubes of the lyre bird
Who's your A&R?
You outta fire yours
My A&R is Amaze 88
Lauren Hell and [?]
And whoever is on KMEL
Plus the weather plus the salmon and crackers
That I was eating and hibiscus ice teas that I was sipping
Plus the laughter of children
Echoing around the corner of the last evening
What... the... fuck?
Plus the feeling of freedom I have from wheelin and dealin
To buy the food that I'm eating
Even though a lot of people are not eating
And I'm seeing that and it sucks and I'm not feeling that
But what can one man do?
I don't know probably a lot
Y'know, it's probably a lot of shit, really, yo
My name is Kool A.D
And I say a lot of shit
You don't even really fucking need to listen to all of it
But some of it is nice, and this joint?
This joint is hella nice
Like fish on yellow rice
I kick like cenobites
My bitcoins hella byte
My shit boy hecka tight
My wrist boy hella ice
Jokes but still wreck a mic
Smoke until my head is right
Hustle till the lettuce ripe
Cut a couple tracks until I get it right
Chuckle when I run it back and it sounds like I ain't said it right
But that's whatever man
Kool might jack Peter Pan up in Neverland, pause
Man I'll just never be Nas man
But I'll never fall off like Adebisi's cap
And I ain't even seen Oz
I just listen to Clipse
You ain't never heard my mix
Just listen to clips
So you can't tell me shit
Better cop all my shit on the Internet
And listen to them
Before you try dissin them
Kool straight glistening
Are you listening?
It's crazy man how I straight piss on them
We be to rap what key be to lock
And y'all be to Ja Rule what he be to Pac
And I said that line last week in another track
But Ladybug's right here so you know I had to bring that sucker back
Oh snap I feel like the rap Mark Zucker-black
Y'all fuckybirds can't fuck with that
And even if you could you wouldn't
Cuz you pussy[Intro: Aesop Rock]
Yeah... riff raff...
Uh, Weathermen, Hieroglyphics, what up? Ok

[Aesop Rock]
Riff raff, alley, when I boom slang, drip draft
Venom with a new twang, same swagger, new thang
Whose gang, a stagger with similar dirty worms
Who occasionally cluster up the service and observe
A.R. periscope, blast through the terror dome
Zoo wanna shark attack, clash til the thrill is gone
Bark back, fresh off the pharmacy, counter doubter pop
Blame it on the overly, eggy, farming a power crops
Dark wing when I pioneer deer, croppin' the odds
With all the proper sprockets and cogs
I bounce with a seventh sin, equipped with a foul jour moment
Waiting for that great celebrity towel throwing

[Del tha Funky Homosapien]
And you niggas know what time it is, it's preservation
The national guard, it's me and Aesop
Rock, stopping any operations against the fence
Del is quick to dispense, with foreign elements
Back, y'all the anchor attribute to the decay
Strives who plays, map your route, cause Aesop is absolute
Del? He practice shoot, basket hoops, capture fools with lasso loops
Hip hop needs two veterans such as us, who ain't never scared
To tear it there, hard to tell, vegetarian and aware of it
Therefore, tearing can take care of it, ok, ok

[Aesop Rock]
I bang on doors, pay rent, lampin' to birth complaints
Rip flipper, make rap music during commercial breaks
Starring Galapagos Island, evolution mutant
Through the one man species, shaking leaches off his Puma's
Beach run ashore, on whores, and contaminated play
Spout try'nna out the older alligator fade away
Make us stay, please, I chisel the missile gently
Blast in the wagon, middle finger, condescends me
Green Earth bum, walk a right plank, he burst one
But yo, keep the rugged play, I'm never stumped
Aes' hid the drum, keep paint under his lung, ugly
Who can know a dog runs more than a rutty puppy

[Del tha Funky Homosapien]
You better have appreciation for this
D-E-L, I'm so hungry, man, I'm tastin' the shit
And the, dirty dingy basement abyss
And it's a bitch, just needle action, like an itch
The only reason why I like to strike it rich
Is to be able to keep the flow, that's how deep it go[Hook]
"Ahonetwo, ahonetwo, I like it..."

[Verse 1]
I'm chocolate like a bar but my name is not Roseanne
My skin has a pigment, reminiscent of a tan
I plan to grow dreads but first a nappy fro
The longer the hair, the easier to scare a foe
It grows from my head until it covers up my face
People look and stare when I walk into the place
This is just a taste from the Funky Human Being
Ain't no misbehavin', ain't no use for ravin'
Surrounded by the people who would stab me in the back
My skin is really brown even though it's labeled black
Sometimes I wear a cap, and sometimes I wear bandanas
Forbidden in L.A. but I wore one in Atlanta
I chiseled up a sculpture to complement my culture
Thoughts of silly Nubians is prone to give me ulcers
Hangin' with the brothers who are tribal in their ways
For this is how I like to spend my days, and it pays
To steal a groovy sample form the archives
Use my mental staff to eliminate apartheid
Still gather papes like my man Malcom Forbes
Ponderin' my life as I look into my orbs

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I love the shade of green like my brother Billy Bixby
I utilize a sample that I salvaged from the 60's cause I'm picky
My meal must appeal to me like Morris
Far too many fraudulent opponents in the forest
I fall into the Gap when I need to purchase clothes
Easy on the fads cause the posers always pose
I suppose they will bite, they'll try not to show it
I came very plain and then feelin' rather loaded
I ditched all the beads cause my needs seem to differ
Me and CM-P are like the Gil and the Skipper
He will use his clippers to give himself a fade
I give my fro a sheen with a smidgen of Pomade
I laid in the shade and I greeted mixel place
With a rhythm and a rhyme and he said that it's a twist
From the ordinary everyday continual assumption that RnB and rap makes a winner
Guess who's comin' through for dinner
A native-like brother with the passive little style
That most certainly will smother
Suicidal rhymes with apocalyptic tunes
I will drink a seltzer while you dabble with the booze
And giggle when I see ya liver shrivel to a prune
I'm the Funky Human Being not a monkey or a coon
Assume that the style is Funkadelic in the 90's
Del is livin' phat as I leave a foe behind me

Song: Ahonetwo Ahonetwo (remix)

I'm chocolate like a bar, but my name is not Roseanne
My skin has a pigment, reminiscent of a tan
I plan to grow dreads, but first a nappy 'fro
The longer the hair, the easier to scare a foe
It grows from my head til it covers up my face
People look and stare when I walk into the place
I grace the stage, I hates the age of charletons
Now I feel the time has come for me to spar with'em
Startin' with a swift up kick and an uppercut (Ouch!)
Plus the funky beat that moves your torso and your upper butt
Then I manipulate the spectators and I drop a real rhyme
For the times are a-changin'
I rearrange my style like a jigsaw
People jock the styles and the rhymes cause it is raw
Walkin' through the streets of Berkley where I lurk free
Brothers try to jerk me to the side and try to hurt me
But perky little devils only get to levels lower than
The grower of the cannibus plants and I dismantle the stance
That ya take, cause I ache the ear canals
Many try to flex my neck, but fear the child, so yep

[Hook]
"Ahonetwo, Ahonetwo, I like it
Ahonewo, Ahonetwo, funky human bein'"

[DEL Talking:]
Damn, fools be jockin' us, you know why they jockin' us? '
Cause we got the straight ultra sound, fool. (Mind music!)
We got the straight ultra sound, fool. We got the straight beat
Fool. (Ha Ha!) We are the dopest, fool
(That's why all the fools at school be jockin' us)
(Yo, check it, check it, check it) (Check this out)
What's up Phesto, you know we the dopest...the whole universe. "

The friendly, many, scopin' up horizons
Keepin' eyes on the mischievious who flys on
The tip like a pile of feces, I release these
Mad troops like Dr. Claw with the mad beats
Sequence that we brings to the world like a flood
I leap like a tigger and I land with a thud
Collasal, causin' earthquakes and the earth shakes constant
Kicks more ass than Charles Bronson
I pounce like a cat cause I think I'm all that
When it comes to the drums, when I see how y'all act
The H to the I, oh my, oh man, it slams
I never came candied like the yams
Sambo, stands low, never to my lattitude
Never was a nigga and I never had an attitude
Never actin' mad at you unless you try to front
On the D-E like you didn't know the day of the month
Once they get a whiff of the shit, you know it's funky
Please keep up your gall
Cause I'mma ball them fools who hunt me
Act like you do, or rather act like you know
Del, Souls of Mischief, Extra Pro, down with Hiero
(Hierogliphics in the house) It's like that y'all
(It's like that y'all, ya don't stop
Check it out y'all, ya don't stop
Check it out, yo, ya don't stop
Hierogliphics in the house, ya don't stop
Souls of Mischief in the house, ya don't stop
Extra Prolific in the house, ya don't stop
T-L-E is in the house, you don't stop

Utilizing all we know
True to life and
Ten-Four I read you
You're see through
I don't believe you
It ain't what your skin hides that's inside

[Verse 1: Casual]
Sliding in key locks locked in the detox
Amazing escape and evasion plots
Black stone, chiropractor crack you backbone
Spectacular when I rap to ya, it's on
And after I masquerade this mic massacre
Last of the "B-Boy" master spell casters
High-roller, lash the beat
Fantastically and put em' fast asleep
Don't discuss this travesty with his majesty
My styles make bullies look bashful
Y'all heard of casual, I get any advised
I rhyme in every minute to be miniaturized
Squeeze the chalice, till my hands get calices
Challengers get they ass kicked into spastic paralysis
I place pillows in cigarillos
Stuff them bitches to their thickest dildos
A nigga will though, marinate till I mildew
Off a brute dub-sack then and I peel too
Y'all niggas shook like seizures
You skeez' us, please us and I leaves ya
Lamping, with your tramp in the Hamptons
Amped' bout' to run throught they camp then I'm vamping
Like a champion, having fun when I run this

[Hook]
(All we know)
Utilizing
(All we know)
True to life and
Ten-Four I read you
You're see-through
I don't believe you
It ain't what your skin hides that inside

[Verse 2: Virtuoso]
This is the source so know that we hitting you off
I'm forward progress increased with centrifugal force
And as I listen I think who did the mixing on your weak sound
That lacks essential punches like the presidential recount
Deep down address the state of my being
And break in museums to take back our freedom from snakes and demons
We end off, when that cat rap it's Ten-Four
You're see-through, I read you they speak your memoirs
Flash ridiculous flows, master physicist
They be like yo that's the hypnotist the way I get with chicks
Sick of this pre-imposed regiment, we disclose evidence
Of the societal foes decadence
The righteous, we gaining advantage we banish sharks of Satan
Battle the biggest star fuck it bring on a constellation
Watch how I kill and fray the Milky Way the silky spray
Filthy gray clouds, to send them to Earth to slay crowds
In evil assemblages, walk straight mind control of cerebral appendages
So it'll lead to your hemorrhages
Quite likely, cuz' you spread rumours your might fight me
But neglectly to write nightly thinking my hype might be
Overblown, but I'm the most powerful of Jehovah's clones
Poison will, thought they said poison milk from the Cobra's pulm
Figure is Virtuoso slay hard
In a rave squad, with brave guards and layed them in the graveyard

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Del]
Deep within we begin through the grass and moss
Spent a wife from the plantation planned grand larsany
My state's malnutrition a low adjustment what's this
Identify then decide
Virtuoso was hopeful, "Cas" was aggrivated
I knew he had to make it, any task taken
Sink or swim, die young or live in wrinkled skin
Only look again cuz' homies think cuz' thinkin' in
The same civilization, my pen is inkin' it
Of the wise they a minus cuz' wise is a mindset
Dumb, deaf, blind and no time reminding
Your ass stays greedy, needy while I fast
And I'm a start there leave em' marked there
That every thought's clear and concise
They say they lived twice
And try and do me like Christ with spice
Dancing with Manson but I ain't that type alright
A fly "Cas-wise", crack survival tactics
Relax and meditate and apply

The math-quick
Get solutions, skip institutions
Strong constitution for our retribution[A-Plus]
He hah... hahaha!!
Yo y'all wanna know about hoes?
Check it... yo

[A-Plus]
Adam is the man that got more honies than a hive of
Bees I skeeze I'm pullin stunts like McGyver
And I try ta, always be patient with a Miss
But I diss, cuz groupies always seem to make me pissed
Huh, they gotta be frontin, wantin to start a phony friendship
I never pretend, the thing I befriend be them hips
And send dips, back to they moms with a grin
But if she's a boo boo head I tell no-one that I got in

[Tajai]
Yo, skins friends I got a lotta, and I gotta
Bend them and then blend all the hottie
Spurts be burstin like a mile a minute
Cuz I can either take it slow or yo I wild up in it
I'm pulling, yes cuz fully dressed or threadbare they're nice
I twist my sides to tickle thighs when my head's there
I now rips sets so foul dips spread my rep
I sew the girls up like Schweppes, so many kids might fret

[Opio]
Afterwards I'm bouncing dips like tits on chicks
Who be running track, but they be running back for more
Rest assured, it's absurd for her to be on linger
I get the finger, cuz she can't get the stinga
Any longer, my dong can stretch and I'm stronger
I got the daddy ding-a-ling to get you hot and bothered
Get the kinks out when my stink in the pink shout and scream
Butta second fling is but a dream

[Phesto]
From day one I played hoes in the schoolyard, my tool heartless
But not for dips submerging it ain't hurt men to merge in
My status, from baddest to Tims I'm pulling more hips
Than gravity, and after the skins get hit, I'm drowsing
Arousing the next dousing the next thousand my saliva
The liver ones cuz I don't try to run in no dumb females
Some be swell, but, my picks so why tricks
Get restricted to flicks with boo boo heads, I screw you dead

[Hook]
I call myself the man (8X)

[Opio]
Niggas cling, and get attached to things on the flute
That's insane, I just be in and bang, get boots
For gosh sakes, that broad shakes, her thang to the whole game
The way the labia lips hang it's a sad shame
Clapping when you're tapping, just hit the scraps and be at em
The breasts sag like they're saddened
The skins are wrinkled, dry, worn and battered
Leave em shattered, she's as fly as a maggot

[Phesto]
The him I am, the man I'm him
Bustin skins out, I been stout erect checkin dips
When I'm wreckin lips and clitorises, hit her with this
[Boom bow bang!!] swinging from my you-know-whats so you know buttcheeks
Are clapping tapping the guts on the late with your date
Makes my ego flip read those lipstick marks on my penal tip
They don't lie, penis took your dip to a fly despise
My description, why, when I'm making them lips bend

[A-Plus]
I hit it, I did it, I admit it
I never quit it, yes I knock the boots like I was Riddick
Bowe, get with it, ho, I get with
No, Boomerang broads with nasty toes
Keep your corns on your husk you muskrat
But if she's fly, I try to bust that
Gluttius maximus, I wax and bust
I'm taxin just to be the mack man Plus

[Tajai]
Once I been with women, friendship done been the sole outcome
How come skins can't work their way in?
The question resting late night at her pad and
Scheming to grab and season, cuz she's in
I fiend getting mad horny, transforming charges
Into swinging me, seemingly hard miss
Let her know that I was on it
Now I got dibs on that crib I'm welcome back cuz I'm Kotter

[Hook][Hook]
Life is a blast when you know what you're doin
Best to know what you're doin 'fore your life get ruined
Life is a thrill when your skill is developed
If you ain't got a skill or trade, then shut the hell up

[Verse 1: Del the Funky Homosapien]
My rhymes is like droppin your head on cement
Crackin' it open hopin to make a dent; I'm hell-bent on
Resurrection, per-fection
Lesson #1: rekindle the essence
Rap ain't about bustin caps and fuckin bitches
It's about fluency with rhymin ingenuity
All of this is new to me, see I peep rhymes
With scrutiny, under a microscope I walk a tightrope
A thin line between insanity and sanity
Mixed with a little vanity, boostin the morality
With Hiero hospitality, soon to strike it rich
Like calories, salaries, ahh sounds like a plan
And, I will expand hip-hop as well
Might even kick a little impromptu, to stomp you
Weaklings, speaking things foreign to the human ear
That, you will fear now, whether you like it or not
Blood clots on your little life on the situation
And on the stipulations... the shit you wastin
Time on you pawns, it was planned like that
But we can fight back, like David Horowitz
And say we want no more of this
And put it in a cyrogenic status
Replace it with the latest in technology
Hip-Hop policies that demolish ya follies
Olly olly oxen free, get off of me
You can't see this, your defeatist attitude'll
Get you nowhere fast, I tend to my task cause

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Del]
Don't even start on the next man, let's scan
Your situation, you still have no patience
Flip on niggas, rob niggas, even family
All the way up to your moms -- you can't stand to be
In the house, but when you kicked out you beggin
To come back in then the same old skit happens
You say you rappin but you don't know the essence
Just ho slap and bustin caps is your message
Plus every time I put some scrill down, you steal it
If that's your way of teachin me a lesson I don't feel it
Your raps reflect your life and that's a shame
Cause the way you're soundin, you must think that it's a game
I can see if you came from the ghetto, but you came
From the Meadow -- you really need to let that go
You got no respect for hip-hop, and you tryin to rhyme
Biding your time and I find it a crime
I even tried to bury the hatchet man,cause we all African
You wanna be a rapper? Start practicin', you can't even flow right
Spend most of your time fuckin hoes, getting in fights
Hangin out, with no mission in life
And you're missing your life, and you'll be missing out on life
I won't sweat you for that G you stole
Cause if you're still alive, I'll be there to see you fold
Told ya!

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Del]
You could be a rapper, an actor, a gun clapper
A comedian providing laughter, as a bachelor
A pastor of a chapter, a doctor, a lawyer
A fireman, a hired hand, whether boy or girl
It's your world. your future you control it
Whatever you do early on, is how you mold it
I record it, sold it, told it to you
Mr. Del wouldn't tell you nothin that ain't true, because

[Hook]

Think you're able to label the Hiero sound?
You still haven't found a comparable variable
You think you're able to label the Hiero sound?
You still haven't found a comparable variable
All you marks... YEAH!

This the freshest shit and you know itAhh
First day off probation, no wastin' time
Just like ancient times, and take a dime and roll it
Blaze it with no fear
After havin' to take piss tests for a whole year
Smokin' with a cold beer makes me kinda think
Why I don't like to drink heavily, cause what my P.O. was tellin' me
'You can't smoke and even eat poppy seeds
But you can buy liquor, and drink all you need'
It's callin' me, I used to drink Heineken's
Now it's 'bout 5 or 10, plus wine and gin
Hennessy, finishing the last drop
To the liquor store was a cash crop
Drive right past the grass spot
Doin' the dumbest shit I ever did in my life
Riskin' my life
Resistin' arrest
It's in my flesh
Probably smell funny
And there go Del's money
Fast forward to 1998
I smash more herb than those old day's
With a whole J to the face
Nah, I'm still feelin' gettin' drunk more than weed
But now we back in Amster-D, got some grams for me
Chocolate Thai and Purple Haze
And blocks of hash that make the J's last for days
Rollin' up so phat, circumference stuffed with major chronic
We can put a wager on it
When we first got out here in Europe it was everywhere
Even at the gas station, I was down in the mat
A fast pace, when I thought 'This shit ain't helpin' nothin'
When I can get elevated straight puffin' nothin''

Chorus:
(Scratching) Straight puffin' nothin'...
(Scratching) Straight puffin' nothin'...
(Scratching) Straight puffin' nothin'...

The smokin' sessions was the best in the world
Plus the price was right, affordable, so more to use
So fat they deserve the Kodak
And no tax so I'm savin'
Not misbehavin'
That's a risk we takin', we ain't talkin' bout that
We in the outback, smokin' till my mouth's black, how's that?
Another fucked up for sho', being blow
I sorta didn't get it crunk
When I was drunk
Slow that liquor down boy, hit this BM, Bob Marley
A tribute
Cause it's probably as fat as it was he rolled
When he strolled
Down the same cobble stone streets
With his own beats
Another generation, a different time zone
With his mind blown, thinkin' up divine poems
Blessed by the father and it gets him farther
It's a father of spiritualities, since it all affects the Karma
I used the herb for good purposes
Some people are sure to diss, but up in Amsterdam they nurcher it
And I can't forget about Crystania
This kid is brainia
Try to sell hard drugs there then they claimin' ya
Life, they only deal with real shit
All the bomb and hash you want to deal it
And all's well, they don't even sell it for much
And the cops don't really touch, cause it ain't slangin' dust
I'm writin' this, right now under the influence
But if you'd just torch those that say I shouldn't do this
Bob Marley'd out, at least 'til I'm back by the lake
But I might roll 1 or 2 for old times sake...

Chorus:
(Scratching)Artist: Del the Funky Homosapien
Album: No Need for Alarm
Song: Boo Boo Heads

KURIOUS: (Talking)

Oh man. Bitches, man, bitches! Sick & tired a this shit
You know what I'm sayin'? Want my money, talkin' shit, don't know
How to act, phuckin' tired, man. FPhuck'm I gonna do, man? Have to put
A foot up your ass? Phuckin' tired of it, man. Phuckin' buy you this
Buy you that, Phuck that shit! Kurious ain't havin' it. Know what I'm
Sayin'?

DEL:

Boo boo head, boo boo head, boo boo head
I want you dead
I want you bled & bleeding
Needing medical assistance, resistance
Ya kiss meant nuthin'
You was bluffin'
Stuffin' my brain with insane thoughts & notions
Most intelligent people freak you
Because they'll know
You'll give ya all
Give up your drawers
Flap ya jaws & lyin'
& have me cryin'
I'll admit it
Someone before musta shitted down your neck
Boo boo head
What can you do dead?
With fled
Instead of the murda
I'll just tell everybody what I heard of
Word up

[Hook:]
D: All a this over boo boo heads
K: All a this, all a this...

Back in elementary school
You made me drool
I was cool
& rules were never broken
A token
Of our friendship
All my friends flippin' somersaults
The fault was not yours
Of course, they didn't know, yo
Grils was yucky
Clear 'round & get slapped like a puck-y
But you never said 'Phuck me'
That wasn't in the pictua
I couldn't hit ya with ya hair & braids
And the games we played
Were fun
Till one day a friend said
'Boo boo heads turn red, in the face
When you place
Ya hands on her ass
In class, and give a spank
A banka full of fun
At recess, and be fresh.'
OK, I'll try it
And die if she does
But she did
And turned around and socked me like Rocky
I feel like a heel for real
But now I'm older
And told ya to keel over
Cause now it's different
No innocence
And women sprints the way
You sway to the forces of evil
And we will bust that ass fast and quickly
I dig G's
Disrespectin' rep
Now it's when they shish-kebabin' brothers
Try and rob another
And I'll rub ya the wrong way
Let the song play

[Hook]
[BRIDGE]

Ooh, I wanna smack you
Mack you & attack you
Even if you black you get no slack
Sue
Call a lawyer
Boy, ya never knew
Ya crew is on a mission
Every weekend
Freakin' & kissin'
With other than ya man
Lets turn the sands in the hourglass
And your power lasts less & guess
& take a gander
I slander ya name & spread propaganda
And I demand ya ta stop
Hop on a train before pain'll
Be ya middle name
In the game of love & happiness
Yes, I caressed ya flesh
But if you test
Ya caught out there without a vest
Mess around and you can rest
I found a new boo boo
Baby, maybe I can crave the
One that saves thee
Reputation, ya'll lets face it
Ya basin'
Smokin', leavin' niggas broken
& open
But I scope in to ya brain
Gain & remain & clues ya use for protection
Now who's next in...

[Hook]

No no no
Check this out [4x]

Mrs. Boo-boo head you never said
That it would be this way
So the jism I spray in your face...
I never waste a drop that plops down
From your chin. You're done again

[Hook][Del]
Mista, twista, get ya
Every single time when I rhyme like I know so I flow
With tha gifted tounge, a cryptic brung
New phrases to enter the mazes-play this
Two times a day with the dayo
Day, hey, hey ho with a day light come
I plum forgot what a wack rhyme was
Because I buzz like a bee in the ears of my peers so
They know and I know we all know day hey yo-
Day light come and me wanna go home-
Cool
No tool, no Smith and Wesson
Just an oppisite so I can pop a bit of
Shit on the mic when I get on the mic
"pee-pee--pee-ping!"
I ricochet a bit on the mic
And I like it-
Just like the gulf or World War I or II
D-E-L will C-R-U-S-H anyone who
Makes advances when I'm incognito
Veto is the answer as I prance upon your skull like a Frito
Finito-but I ain't finished
Till I like to flip side rhymes cause the rhythm gets diminished

[Casual]
I would if I could but I ain't cause I'm dank
Time for me to lay down the law: who's raw?
You saw the blues and the shoes of the writer
Stronger than a Cisco and you're like a cider
Watery-
Try to win the lottery before you try to slaughter me
Because I'm not the g
To be stepped to
Kept you on your toes
As my rap crew I let loose negative tones
So you better get flows to counter act what we've done
Proceed more killed cause I’m armed like a sleeve, son
We go and step back as I wreck shop
Collect respect props and deck the next prop
Artist-the hardest is the one who won’t pass out
If Tyson’s last name was Rophone, I’d knock his ass out
The bigger the better the better the bigger is
Whenever you figure this nigga is gettin his
Be real and don't kill my walk with your next thought
And answer that your boss-
Cause that's when you lost
Keep on losing, amusing many tactics
I came to earn more green than Saint Patrick
And I make backs if you get caught frontin'
Never bought a Newport but I'm on the button

[Tajai]
I needs no sugar crisp to get swift
So what with two syllables-it's just the positive
Tajai, I steals Souls that try to steal my laddin'
Coming to your brain like I would on a sheet
I respond with no distraction when I see one
Fatter than re-run so what's happennin'?
It's not where you from, it's just how you come
Correct my stacks will get rough to bake
Get phucked enough to my men like idie midie
Look in the membrane enough because I am a righty
Fight these- You'll catch follies if you folly
I make shanks to stick fakes I'm dank and you're quaint
Wack shit puritian surround like ineffectual
I get um-blunt style like the heart of homosexuals
Not for sex when you cross the intersection you're damaged
Get bruised knuckles and what you look for
Bad ones
Busted a few much more than two
A slew of sold ass phonies
Bust their cohonies
Try me
You'll catch my Vans in your highknee
That's if my bankrupt slips though I doubt
How do you want to convert me in time
But I seize more than those candies-nothing gets by me
So play them tracks- And you'll go out like beta max
Next to Tajai cause I kicks the greater stacks

[Opio]
Be deep boom-
Bob your head to this, mischievous
Soul socidle
Idle chatter never slips off the lips of this writter
Might not be the greater innovater of the mind scheme
But my style is like the visine: it gets your eyes opening
This raggedy andy gets dandy like a lion in the meadow
While the teapot blows steam like a kettle
The hip to the hop
I make up flip when I get drastic
Stepping with their moods but their flows are pornographic
And man with the vocal making the locals go insane
The regal rhyming speech substan-nance for the brain
Get frisky with the phrases like you praises like a deity
The one with liberated souls
-control for infinity
Got style much slimma-kids' got a body child
Hieroglyphics gonna flip the rhythm for the meanwhile
Articulate my lingo as I linger in my medium of speech
And I could keep poppin cause I'm trying to teach
A smidgen of religion to the fraudulant
Listen, pay attention I'm the master of this convention
Kick the wigidy while ye style be stutering
Just like smiley
Skipping singles down your satur-dreams to bad it seems you try me
And I can make it play down into extreme conscienceness
Plus your wondering extinguish all them myths
Optimistic, stylistic, mysticness I'm swift like murcury
Nursing me
I show I've got the gift

[A-Plus]
People call me Snupe: just because I'm living fat
People call me nasty: it's because I eat the cat
And I swing a bat to level heads, leaving devils dead
Never said, never cause I called my heads better dreads
Lock on the top of my crop, never flakey
If this was a field then Bo Jackson couldn’t shake me
Bake me, Betty Crocker’s oven isn’t hot enough
If you wanna spread the skins then I got a lot of stuff
Gotta bluff, gotta tough, gotta lick it twice
Why step? here's a fly rep, I kept my step ladder
I had a fatter spliff I be hittin on
Now it's just a smidgen like a pidgeon I be shittin' on
Sittin on a futon, slippin lots a Roots on
I’m the type of brotha that ya have to get ya troops on
Oops, I'm sorry cause I didn't mean to dis you
I could hook a ho and make her blow like I was tissue
Mary had a little lamb, Adam got a lot of dough
Meet up at your garden, Skyline got a lotta hoes
Yo-I didn't mean hoes, yo I meant women
If she got the pooh, I got the trunks: let's go swimming
Dip dip dive as I'm live
Moving in on the top of my jock you don't stop
Here a pimp there a pimp everywhere a pimp pimp
This A-plus grades the quiz-so there it isWelllllll alright hold tight
My rhymes are bright bold light shining on MC's who bite
Impairing the eyesight, quite a few niggas feel it
But conceal it, I need to get a club
To stop them from stealing it

Some of them Hiero principalities
Gotta light it up like a pyro amongst dry leaves
Sucka niggas in denial and I know why
Cause they never seen a rival who rhyme so fly
In defense of, in the sense of rockin the mic
With intents of invoking my unspoken title
Rhymes are shinin like the finest diamonds
I guess I'm liable for what they do to a rival
Hip-Hop survival, soaring like a spiral
Rotating rough rhymes with no hatin, while you
Niggas actin silly like, "So Casual hard?"
They ain't knowin that I'm sewin up the block like the National Guard
I be doin the saaame shit, most niggas do
I'll blast a nigga ass quick as you
But that's not what I'm about, you can put me in a rhymin bout
Turn it out with-out no problem
MC's is like chemicals, watch me dissolve em
Petty individuals infestin hip-hop
I leave em all over the floor like cigar intestines
You better count your blessings, it amounts to less
Than zero, the Hiero hero
Hieroglyphic sequence hittin with rhymes that are regal
And we know...

Hey now, c'mon huh (HIERO)
What? (GLYPHICS)
C'mon c'mon (HIERO)
What you say? (GLYPHICS)

It's on in this motherfucker, yeah[Del]
People havin memory loss, they don't remember I'm the boss
You're claustraphobic, when I close in
In on your men and your faculty, you wack'll be
Out my face, you must be basin if you think
That you could tackle the triumphant, I pump it, the volume
Increase as you mieces get sliced to pieces
Please listen to my album
Even if you're white like talcum and unpaid get'cha stayin
Tuned with my tune and I presume and see doom, designated
To anyone who stated
A word against me, I serve an MC, simply
Put like my foot up your anus, ya Shamus
Tryin to get over, I'mma go for mine
You know the time now that I'm older I'm gonna
Rip niggas heads with the said salutations
Introducing Del and his bid for boostin tales
Of my adventures, attempt to try
And you will limp or die, whichever I choose, you lose
Crews get ashamed cause we blame 'em for bitin
You might win, if you start writin, and stop fightin
No time for games
I rearrange my vocals and your head falls
I hold 'til I get a answer
Acknowledge and abolish all the wack records
Hieroglyphics, you know, repected

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Who caught the harm? You bought the farm
If you're a friend, there's no need for alarm

[Del]
I get juiced when I let loose a little of my cleverness
Open up my follicles with no mousse
Choose your weapon, you kept steppin
You're swept in a hurricane, Del'll blow your brain
So your next generations of youth will be facin the truth
And the truth is I'll leave you with the loose tooth
Gums get split if you bit
I'll extract the truth out your ass like I'm standin in the pulpit
Or a lie detector wrecked ya sector, when you're standing
I can swing, branding, expanding, on what I'm handing
To the people, cause we will, and you can't say
A damn thing about it, if you doubt it
You're already outta line, so let me remind your behind
About the switch which I used to bruise your bottom
That little nigga tried to cut, I caught him
He didn't think that I would see that
So be that, and be off the D cause we rap
We sap the strength and lap the length around the whole course of time
And still got the time to unwind

[Hook]

[Del]
Weak MC's make me earl
Hurl as your world is crushed because I gotta make you hush
You gotta be eliminated, the way I demonstrate it
You hate it, but still I am the greatest
Like a boxer, I'mma knock your socks off
Nowhere to run to, exits are blocked off
Steadily I'm dissin men, I hope you're listenin
Brothers like my flow
Others ride my jock like a bicycle, but I'm psycho
Fools try to play me like Tyco, gotsta pull the rifle
Daisy, graze the ass with the bee-bee
It comes speedy, sign the peace treaty
Or you'll be needin
Medical attention when I leave you bleedin
Throw a monkey wrench in your program
Crammed up your ass and it's just too bad, son
Catch a bad one

[Hook] - 1X

[Final Hook]
Who caught the harm? You bought the farm
If you're a friend, there's no need for alarm
Who caught the harm? You bought the farm
If you're a foe I'm gonna break your fuckin arm!

[Del]
KnowhatI'msayin? Peace[Hook]
You gotta get a better view outside, bird's eye view inside
I annihilate fools get the mileage, birds eye view catch all this
Birds eye view catch all this
Birds eye view catch all this
Birds eye view catch all this
Birds eye view catch all this

[Verse One]
Del, You don't need much proof
When I'm in the sound proof booth, I get loose
Your Excellency, better than the rest of emcees, best with the beat
My capacitors collapse your faders, when I come lackadaisical
That's the way to go
Smash the radio
Pass the gravy too well I behave a fool
High level virtual humanoid, leave your whole crew destroyed
When I switch to manual
Cause I don't stick to manuals
I'm back with panic filled, Manic skills
That weave the tapestry you can't capture me
On video, DVD, or camera
I mangle mice in a maniacal manner
Feed back, fry ya scanners
They wave white banners, like dandruff
Hand cuffed to tracks like a prisoner
Non-visionary commentary is a listener

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
Compelling, unpredictable, how I spit my flow
Get the dough
But rich or poor, I enrich my soul
I can't forget my bro's, that's unforgivable
Live as though you can play, that's when you get stripped to ya bare essence
To finally know your fates stop wastin time and try 2 share lessons
They're guessin, puzzled muzzled
By society undeniably subtle
Technology to make a space shuttle
Technology to make the earth rumble
Get a whiff, it smell like trouble
But Del likes trouble and I don't need a double
Meet it head on, let's hope it's dead on
There's a time for dancing and mind expansion
Tryin to balance, your mind is challenged
To get past lies and violence
Lies and silence, wiped out
Like a surfboard I dun know what hurts more
Knowin, not knowin, or can't controlling
But I control my destiny
In my heart I hold it, I can't let the world get the best of me

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
Devastating mic control, Levitating master flows
Infrared lyrics snipe ya dome, And I write it like a poem
Notorious like a Poe, a title I have the right to own
Celebrate elevation, And try to make sense outta these statements
I'm information inflated
While emcees done plagerated
Critics don't buy the records
Fans do and I respect that
Del, my signature style is assembled and wild
He can do what he like it's two of me
Both sides of the brain
Watch emcees flow right down the drain
My special moves will rescue you from mediocrity and popular offerings
Operating at a high speed, You don't know yet just try me

[Hook]Artist: Del the Funky Homosapien

Song: Check It Ooout

Yeah (4x)
Now check this shit out (4x)
Now this first shit, is about me...

[Verse 1]
When it's time for me to recline
I listen to rhymes and beats in the waves of the spine
To the brain
Relievin' pain & anguish
The stangest arrays make me sway and make my day brighta
The hip hop invita
Write arrive a little soona
Check the soles on my Pumas
My attitude is miserable
Cause in my mind I'm sayin' here's a fool I don't like
I won't strike his ass in the face
I'm blastin' the bass in my headphones
A fool don't have to get his head flown
Why waste time with rhymes?
I get straight to the point
Like I HATE when funk's in the joint
When hip hop is playin'
Threatenin' to spray men
Don't threaten me
Or you won't be able to see
When I gouge ya eyes out
I despise doubt
On your part
Like I won't stab you in your heart
My flow is drastic
Serious, sarcastic
My motto is
"Fuuck with me & get your ass kicked."
And that's the key to understandin' me
And if they cool then the foot is what you'll be brandin', B
Yeah...

[Bridge]
Check it ooout (check it ooout)
Check it ooout (check it ooout)
This shit is fat (check it ooout)
You know you like it (check it ooout)
Now peep this shit (check it ooout)
Yo, peep this shit (check it ooout)
Yo, this is for the homies (check it ooout)
This is your shit, your shit so you can be cognitive(check it ooout)
If you can rap
Yeah...

[Verse 2]
I love to peep a rhyme
First of all I'm seein' if my man can keep the time
If he go off beat, and it's on purpose
He gotta come back on beat
Or the effort is worthless
I like ot hear a cool flow
But if it's identical to another, he a fool for it
Ya gotta build
Upon skills
And all that copy that most popular rapper shit can get killed
I like a nigga who is quick-witted
Cause it make me feel like I do, when I come from where my dick split it
And I admit it, it's a joy
When I hear a nigga avoid the wack and make 'em paranoid
I loves niggas who talk shit
Cause that's my department
I got somethin' for anyone who starts shit
Cause I'm relentless
With a sentence
A jail sentence, after I beat you senseless
I like niggas when they add rhymes, mad rhymes
Then I laugh at niggas who fell off but had rhymes
Just some descriptions of what I like to listen to
With my Bruce Banner scanner point of view...

[Bridge]
Peep! Yo peep that shit that nigga talkin' about Bruce Banner (check it ooout)
Fuckin', Incredible Hulk shit (check it ooout)
Peep that shit (check it ooout)
Yo check it out (check it ooout)
Check that shit out (check it ooout)
Yo check it out (check it ooout)
Yo, peep this last shit (check it ooout)
Everybody about to know this shit (check it ooout)
You know what I'm saying, Rolling Stone

[Verse 3]
Now I'm about to clown a bitch
She made my eyebrows twitch
Cause she's rich
Yeah, real funny
She makes some money
For puttin' other niggas down
You nuthin' but a clown
You can't write
And you're not bright
You fail to notice the dopeness
Cause you have no insight
You need to quit
You ain't shit
You need to get a lesson, in hip hop detection
And you're next in my list to jack
It's a fact not fiction
Bitch, stop ya bitchin'
You write articles
I'mma rip apart ya skull
Cause ya dull
Not entertainin'
I'mma put ya brain in orbit
Cause I'm morbid
Thinkin' a new ways to kill ya
And yo
I feel ya
Ya too critical
And ain't got a bit a pull
Just admit it fool
Before we get rid of you
A rolling stone gathers no moss
And now who will pay the cost
And afterwards get lost
Hit the dirt, before you get hurt
I eat stupid bitches like you and a rhyme for dessert
I bet you never get no dick
You make me so sick
So my pistol is loaded...

[Outro]
Hey you check what this ho did?
Yeah I checked that bitch, I checked that bitch
Y'all niggas ain't got to trip, you know what I'm saying, fuck this shit (check it ooout)
Check it out (check it ooout)
Check it out (check it ooout)
Yo, check that shit out (check it ooout)
Rewind that shit and check that shit out (check it ooout)
Check all them three verses out (check it ooout)
Check it out (check it ooout)
Check it out (check it ooout)

[Hook: 2D]
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine, in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on

[Verse 1: Del]
Finally, someone let me out of my cage
Now, time for me is nothing cause I'm countin' no age
Nah, I couldn't be there, now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs, and I'm under each snare
Intangible, bet you didn't think so I command you to
Panoramic view, look, I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose, sit and lose, all you different crews
Chicks and dudes, who you think is really kickin' tunes
Picture you getting down in a picture tube
Like you lit the fuse, you think it's fictional
Mystical? Maybe, spiritual
Hero who appears in you to clear your view when you're too crazy
Lifeless to know the definition for what life is
Priceless to you because I put you on the hype shit
You like it? Gun smokin', righteous with one toke
Psychic among those, possess you with one go

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Del]
The essence, the basics, without it you make it
Allow me to make this, childlike in nature
Rhythm, you have it or you don't, that's a fallacy
I'm in them, every sprouting tree, every child o' peace
Every cloud and sea, you see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise, corruption in disguise (that's right)
From this fucking enterprise, now I'm sucked into your lies
Through Russel, not his muscles, but the percussion he provides
With me as a guide, y'all can see me now cause you don't see with your eye
You perceive with your mind
That's the inner, so I'mma stick around with Russ and be a mentor
Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember
Where the thought is, I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless
Feelings, sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing, and remember: that it's all in your head

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
I’m a gangsta, but y'all knew that
Da Big Boss Dogg, yeah I had to do that
I keep a blue flag hanging out my backside
But only on the left side, yeah that’s the Crip side
Ain’t no other way to play the game the way I play
I cut so much, you thought I was a DJ
2, ippy-ippy 1 yo, 3
I'm S-N double O-P, D-O double G
I can’t fake it, just break it, and when I take it
See I specialize in making all the girls get naked
So bring your friends, all of y'all come inside
We got a world premiere right here, now get live!
So don’t change the dizzle, turn it up a little
I got a living room full of fine dime brizzles
Waiting on the Pizzle, the Dizzle and the Chizzle
G’s to the bizzack, now ladies here we gizzo

[Hook x3][Del tha Funkee Homosapien]
Nowadays the power plays make you wanna about face
Enough to give you the sour face once you hear what the crowd say
See I be around the way where you can hear the sounds of today
Some of that sound is bound to escape through the urban city whirlwind
Call me the epitome of wordsmith, every bit as enduring
As your commercial favorites, save you from the surface chambers
I'm giving birth to bangers, underground, they surface later
Furthermore, I'm squirting flamers when I hear the words from haters
Yeah, that's words of fury when I'm on my tour of duty
I stay calm, you're unruly, Quiet Storm, you're too moody
Pirates on the open waves, fire on the hopeless knaves
Time moves on, I grow with age, biting down with cobra fangs
Eyes wide open, I know the game, divide my focus, I know my lane
Trying to ride over my flow to reign, asphixiate you like a choke chain

[Sample]
Set me free
Set me free
Set me free
Set me free

[Ladybug Mecca]
I'm in the core with the surreal, no ordinary feel
Dreams pass into action and mingle with Sir DZL
Illuminate, don't fizzle, then find me in the zone
Stand alone in my duality, we taste life twice
I see it as I am, as I like
Feeling light and vaporous
Wordplay with A.D. and us
Kool as fuck
And Coolie High
In the shire
Replenish me
I'm the source to core, you return for more
Guidance
Through this delicate play
Headfirst in too deep
It's the shallow lane we avoid like creeps

[Kool A.D.]
My raps run laps around tracks like Usain Bolt
Michael Phelps with insane gold, I trained for it
Easy listening pissing confetti from your car's stereo faceplate
There he go, vacate
Away, way on some other necks
Fresh, the brother flex
Vagabonding in the Western world, yo
I think I'm Phil Lynott, or was it Phil Lie-not? Sure, why not?
I think I'm Jim Fitzpatrick in a Che Guevara t-shirt
I'm so Anne Frank, I hit that attic with a bad bitch
And hide out for about two weeks
Just to meditate on the two cheeks
Dawg, I Federlined that [brooney?]
Wait, oops oops, I mean Britney
Man, I'm off a deuce-deuce of that O.E
Now she calling me like "boo, see"
Ha-ha, hee-hee, ha-ha, ooh-whee
You're [?] tooth and no speak
Kool bring the news like it's Newsweek
Y'all not... me, y'all
Too weak
I'm like CNN, go ask Chuck D and them
Get the R. Kelly tape, see how we pee on them
All the new moves, please know that we on them, heh
You see my friends? Sip beers, burn trees
Kick weird words, B
This here, surely
Could lift ears to worlds we could miss if
We did not listen properly

[Sample]
[laughing] Oh, but seriously

[Sample: Q-Tip, "Oh My God"]
I don't know, man
I don't know, man
I don't know, man
I don't know, man
I don't know[Hook]
We 'bout to roll to the corner me and my crew
We 'bout to roll to the corner and get us some brew
We 'bout to roll to the corner and some swishers too
So we can roll a fat blunt and get perved

Another fine day in this land I live
Oakland where they don't give a shit and that's it
You know I'm sellin dank and split the profit 50/50
With this other brother who went in half with me
Now, first before we burst the move
We gotta sooth our nerves with the liquor
Then we don't bicker
We'll be relaxed ask your mama
This shit is like a war zone
Streets is hot like the Bahamas
But we will stay away from the drama
I'm wearin' my snipe, my arctic jacket with the wool like a llama
But then we had to pause like a comma
Cause someone got stuck and bucked and family was outside with trauma
We heard the shots from inside and whenever gats go off
I hit the deck and hide
And if po-po said they got there on time they lied
But you gotta give them credit they try
I see a mother cry and I'm wondering why
And my man said fuck it ain't nothin' we can do
But to continue our mission down the block for the brew
And we out (yeah, yeah)

[Hook 2x]

On our way we 'bout half way there
Children runnin' everywhere like they just don't care
The Muslim Bakery is like right between
And if I pass by with beer they will look at me mean
So I ducks in and gets my Final Call now
Cause still my brain gotta be well endowed and proud
The ambulances signals and glances
So let's hurry up and don't take no chances
Niggas step to us trying to rap like we got all the answers
In front of the store trying to work that sleight of hand
The panhandlers, they not no amateurs
Daily reminders of how I gotta find a way to come up
It sums up life along with the kids and a wife
But anyway, we pass the local grocery store
And you can be sure the meats and the produce ain't good no more
Some of it is from days before
I want it fresh and the clerk ain't my race so he stress
They doin me in my community - fuck it, we there
Ain't enough for a 6 pack so we had to share
A nice little stroll through the April spring air
We hide our shit so the Nation don't see it there

[Hook 2x]"It is the year 2387
Man has relieved an overcrowded Earth
By the establishment of planetary colonies
In other star systems of the milky way galaxy
The most successful of these colonies
Is on Maris, a planet so Earthlike, that many call it Earth 2"

(CHORUS)(2x)
Cyberpunks, MegaDel, ultra violences when I adjust
Future phenomenon, you need to try it once

MegaDel Cyberpunk technology such as cyberbots
Check the rhymes I concocked, private stock
While you jock I set a ultra security
For MC intelligents who wanna murder me
It's like the third degree
The way I question my sanity
I work on cybernetics as a form of vanity
To protect my circuitry I stay under the canopy
I send the special ships to finish my fantasy
To become a bionic commando, monitor scandals
Solar panels reflect, energy enters me
MC's energy in the 21st century
Soling temper release, fusable alloys like musical cowboys
Super bomb raps, capable of alien contact
With rhyme pacts, create galactic soundtracks
Profound facts to word classify invoke for several decades
By the C.I.A. or now pedal death codes on the internet
The center's flesh, I smoke a pinner of bless and can't remember next
Transmission control, you better listen to your soul
When your carbon base creatures connects with technology
Brand new species, devoid of ecology
Totally electronic they monitor and follow me

(CHORUS)

Escape the cold flu, still down with kung fu
Back then they hung you, but now they fun chew
I touch the escape key, a blue light envelopes me
Covers me with energy and sucks me in the screen
I met Tron, he said don't let out about the cyber universe
Because you the first human to discover us
Neon lasers with colorful photons
I felt like voltron my hands turned to silver
Probably woulda killed ya, I just lost my sanity
My brain was enhanced with super intelligence
Shoot the elements, we stowed with a charged beam
Victory was our theme, packed more silicon than sardines
Transformed into a plane like star screens
Cyberpunk, rockin' the mic with auto targeting
5th element, the strength of six elephants
It was miraculous the way they pashed me in
Equipped with electric grenades
Testin' my phaser, I melted some glaciers, wow this great stuff
Powered with voltage, a technofile armed with explosives
Missiles, a crystalizer
To freeze MC's and then shatter them with super bases
Around relentless pound against the ground
Like an asteroid, a metal bohemive
More than you can dream of, a morval team of
Both sides of the brain
Transmuted to my physical form to ride the train
My eyes had a neon green glow, I seen foes
Instruments self destruction, made for huntin'

(CHORUS)

Controllin' cyberspace like a girl's private place
With a chassity belt, I has to be felt
Futuristic crucifixing super diction
With computer victims, terminated through the symptoms
To virus', sophisticated and bizaare
Enthrawling, I even serve smart drinks at the bar
Bonzai, mechanical tenticles hard times
For small fry who tried to hog the mic
You saw the light, took all the stripes
Stop the spying theives
That I percieve when my optics turn lime green
In this industrial environment, there's certain requirements
The mental training that helps you see the Leviathon
I'm pilotin' a giant mecha in my private sector
My invisible forcefields of course yields
The inner sanctum, better do the interface
Master programmers create aircrafts that look like dinner plates
The Zentraedi mobbed me
I did concert on their planet for 5 G's
Space the last frontier
Another make you pass on beer, we hellucinagetics with speed

(CHORUS)[Verse 1]
As simple as it sounds, is as simple as it ought to be
Light skin girls lack the dark skin quality
Ya don't understand? You want an explanation?
Well let D-E-L release the frustration
As I see it, every single day
Light skin girls ain't satisfied unless they get their way, always
Plus they act stuck up
They all add up to one great big fuck up
They try to play suck up when they want somethin'
Then always leave a brother with nothin'
Ya think ya look better cause ya skin's a little bit lighter?
You're thinkin' you're my type like I was a typewriter?
No, ya think ya all of that and all of this
But you ain't really shit without a makeup kit
See, ya might be light but ya ugly to me
Black is beautiful, to me, that's beauty

[Hook]×2
Dark skin girls are better than light skin
Light skin girls ain't better than dark skin
[Ice Cube:] I disagree homeboy

[Verse 2]
Now, lets get to the problems
And see if there's a way to solve them
Problem #1, has got to be the attitude
Which is usually vain, selfish and rude
Personality, with her nose stuck up
So don't try talkin' to her or walkin' with her
To class cause it's out of the question
Cause you bein' dark is the wrong complexion
For her. She wish she was light, though
I mean lighter than light, or as close to white as possible
But I fight to stay a brother
You see, green and dark skin sisters are the color
This don't apply to all the girls with light skin
Just the ones with their heads up their rear end
Cause if it did, static would occur
Dark skin cuties is what I prefer
Now, look at her, her vision is a blur
Cause contact lenses only let ya see Benzes
Plus she would fuss and cuss if I tried to talk to her
Cause I'm a man who rides the bus
I get frustrated, well, lets say I used to
Now a dark and lovely is who I give juice to
So come on, step to Del if ya with this
This is the facts, so brothers don't forget this

[Hook]×2

[Verse 3]
I can't understand you light skin wenches
Ya think ya all that cause ya have long extensions?
Your hair was natural now ya got played out braids
You woulda looked better with a fade
Dark skin girls are so fly, so honest, so sweet
That's the type of girl I wanna meet
Complete, not phony or a fake like you are
See, Del is bolder, I tap you on the shoulder
And say, "Hey lighty, could you tap that sister for me?"
But you love Mr. Loveable so you'll just ignore me
So find another tip that you can hop upon
To get with me ya need some sun and some Coppertone
You'll take a white boyfriend before a black one
That's why Del has to stand and attack one
Next time you see a girl darker than you
No disrespect when you met her, cause the girl looked better than you

[Hook]×2[Casual]

Drop some new shit on 'em them
Let's drop some new shit on 'em

[Opio]

Drop it on 'em Cas

[Casual]

Some brand new new shit
Going

[Del]

Yeah, this D-E-L in the house
And Hieroglyphics crew
Down wit' Matt Kelly, A-Plus, Domino
Man, we about to kick this little shit right here on my down time on the
Album
Check it out

MC's is too promiscious so if you fuss
I'mma be the next to bust and take you on the Exodus
Wreckless
Checklist, ain't nobody next to us
Step to us and get reduced to a speck of dust
Fuck the hellala detectives with they secret societies
We speak wit' variety
So stand back
Before you caught in my sand traps
Hilarious you better vary it, you bury it
Go along with your merriment
Hiero getting ever cent
And we earned it, and burned it
In your brains like brands
And now, everyone demands
Del and his entourage and you can all get squashed
He mosh it up, we mega and vicious
Magnificent
Fuck the whimsical misteral
We stiffed through competitors and regulate
And make you hesistate you better wait
Time to set it straight
You never take a flow for granted
Cause what you ain't peeping
Is equal to what we call "sleeping"
Slumbering and fucking cumbersome
Keep the tabs on them tongues
And let the bomb numb your lungs
Yeah
Cranialologist
The zany novelist
The tactical graphical
With lyrics for capital
After you, high speed chase
To erase
All existing life forms and drive 'em to free base

[Coughing]

Song: Don't Forget

Don't forget ya niggas
My rep gets bigger
And figgers on my checks
Flex
Like Hercules
When I flow with ease
Usin' lingo that'll bring mo hoes
Front and center
Enta this blissful twist
Full of fun, for my niggas
Here's another one
You get a hand shake
And take a copy of the UNA
We're doin' a service
And who are they?
Questions and answers
And we can sure
Capture the spirits in ya soul cause the man's pure
And furious
Cause curiosity killed the cat
Why fill the gat with lead & leave a nigga dead?
But if you was that nigga
Don't sweat me
Cause if I was that nigga I wouldn't pull the trigga
Protect yourself but don't project yourself
Into trouble
Cause, you'll perish, there is
Some things I never forget
Police sweats when we out posted like marionettes
We jets, unless them hands be empty
They lookin' for niggas, yeah
They not allowed to peel me

[Hook:]
"Don't forget your niggas..."

Don't forget ya niggas
Even if they low down niggas
Cause I sho found niggas
Down on they luck
Here's a pound, and a buck
And you better not spend it on no booze
Choose what is more important
I'm a nigga who will ford shit
Before it starts
We score with heart
Artistic values
And I'll use a portion of the brain
Other niggas is ignorin'
Ya snorin'
What's up my niggas
Hi niggas
I figures
I'm the nigga who can rig a rhythm to ya soul
Plain & simple
Then pull, other tricks out my sleeve
And leave unseen
Clean & slicklike
Niggas need to get they shit right
For they step to HIEROGLYPHICS it might
Prove fatal
So move, wait till I'm done
I use fun & fabrications
For your imagination
Wastin', spillin'
Blood when I'm ill &
Depressed
Cause I take it out on others
Not the brothers
Just record executives
And I bet you give
Up ya cash
When I leave you with a gash in ya ass
Cause I had a heart when I started
Now I departed
And I'm back again
Give me ends
'fore I bust into ya office squeezin' triggas
Because you, because you, cause you forgot us niggas

[CHORUS:]

Now peep
I knew a nigga that was large
That nigga used to rap good
Now I'm askin' him
Perhaps, could you tell me how you fell off
Yet you was well off
But now the real niggas think ya soft
Cause we beat rhymes
You can't keep up with the times
It seems you have styles combined
From other fools
And you'll discover who will be a real nigga
You da man
You supposed to shield niggas
When you say you will
You don't display you skill
And still you throw your niggas out the doors
Scores of years ago you was bros
But now you got a little dough
And yeah you tryin' to play him like a ho
But I don't think so
He ain't a puppet
Enough with that shit
Take that job
Stuff it
Up ya ass
Just gimme enough for gas
I'm rough & I can last
And get my own phuckin' cash
Well that's that
And what do you get for that?
Ooh you dirty rat
How could you forget the fool
That was down wit ya in school
Ya'll use ta shoot pool
Ya sorry busta
Never could trust a
Nigga think he's so large
That nobody can thrust him
Out the pilot seat
Ejected
You forgot ya nigga
Ya assed out
Expect it

[Hook]
