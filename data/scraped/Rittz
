[Hook: Mike Posner]
I've got sunshine in my pocket, I'm just right here in my zone
I've got Sade in my tape deck, I'm just movin' right along
All these haters really love me, they just pretend that they don't
Cause I've got sunshine in my pocket, I'm just right here in my zone
In my zone

[Bridge: Mike Posner]
Zo-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
In my zone, zo-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
In my zone, zo-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
When I'm in my, when I'm in my
Zo-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh - in my zone

[Verse 1: Rittz]
In my old school bumpin' that "Kiss of Life" beneath the city lights
Caught up in the moment, getting misty eyed
Bout to give my past life a long kiss goodnight
This dream difficult for me to visualize
And now it's real and they say the limit is the sky
But my feet set on solid ground, no more stalling now
On the road to get it cause, when it rained, it poured
But now the storms finally calming down
Up in my cutlass driving, the sun is shining
My Strange piece studded with a ton of diamonds
I ain't got a bunch of money on a constant grind
Still it beats being blunted with my stomach growlin'
In the darkest alley, got the heart to fight
I see the stars are bright, they screaming Jonny Valiant
Rappers wanna bite me, they crocodiling
I be up in Neiman Marcus smiling
Try to walk a mile inside my J's, playing make believe
You can say that you played in the major league
Wear my heart on my sleeve on the stage and leave
I feel wet from the sweat on my Famous tee
I'm never scared, fuck shaking like a maple leaf
Cause what awaits for me is unknown
So I lit up my J, filled my cid-up with straight
Crown Royal, now I'm in my zone

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rittz]
This ain't no ordinary love
I was sick of being poor and said "enough"
Right up 85 North and there I was
Working, breaking down doors and barriers
Still representing Georgia, I'm feeling the support
Spread the word cause the more, the merrier
Nobody blowing out the torch I carry
I ignore them every time they point and stare and judge
All because I got Jordans on, I got a gorgeous blonde
And my jewelry blinds, I got stupid style
Getting' paid doing music now, I'm putting' huge amounts
Inside a few accounts, I got a crew that's down
In case you wanna come and duke it out
If I was you, I'd throw the deuce and bounce
And we just blew an ounce
My hotel room looking like a hookah lounge
I'm blowing up like a bazooka round
I got booed and bowed but stayed positive
Even when I didn't have a pot to piss in
I was sitting on a bottle steady plotting this
And I'll be fine dining at The Optimist
I got the black sea bass and the lobster bisque
And took a shot of whiskey to the dome
Made a toast to the homies that are gone
Two for the fans and the love they shown, I'm in my... zone

[Hook]

[Verse 3: B.o.B]
My calendar at this caliber's for the life of a bachelor
I'm burning through cannabis canister after canister
Um, so many cameras, they flashing, I never glance at 'em
Lost inside of a landfill of thoughts while watching this dancer
I'm wondering to myself if she's got some booty enhancer
Either way, I feel the deep inclination of putting my hands on her
I'm a modern day Galileo who lives in Atlanta
The capital of the ratchets, aristocrats and traffickers
A practitioner, practice until I master it
Passionate 'bout my adjectives, syllables so elaborate
Anything less to describe me is just inaccurate
You're a student of classes in which I am a graduate
Immaculate vernacular, Batmobile look like Dracula
Giving these boys the blues while telling these hoes to saddle up
You catching feelings, I think you squarer than Madison, I'm-
I'm in my zone, ain't no way I'll ever snap out of it

[Hook]

[Bridge 2: Mike Posner]
Zo-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, in my zone
Zo-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, in my zone[Verse 1: Rittz]
Superstar, man I'm far from an average Joe, supernatural
Stepping out, looking like I'm in a fashion show
Came into this industry and now you're witnessing me blow up
Like seeing a tank of gas explode
And I'm, I'm high like I'm flyin sitting back of coach
By the window sipping Jack and Cokes
'Bout to pack a bowl but we ain't tryna bake a casserole
Looking at the globe from up high, shots fired
Like Kennedy was riding by the Grassy Knoll
I ain't rich but I got a little cash to blow
When haters saying that I'm changing
I'll be looking at them laughing like they cracked a joke
They wasn't with me when I traveled down this gravel road
GC, I could never have my pass revoked
So step up and you a dead duck
Get your head bust, looking like a chef just cracked a yolk
Speakers in the Caddy rattling the patio
When the industry was only rocking platinum gold
I was dope back then, but you had the whole
Shit locked until I came and I cracked the code
And I don't, I don't really mean to brag and boast
But then again, my fans look at me as the G.O.A.T
She said she listen to my music in the bath and soak
Now that's a rap to quote, hop in my 'Lac and float
A Ya Uh Yeah

[Hook: Rittz]
Take a puff and it's up and away we go
Put some pimp shit on my radio and bounce, bounce, out
Let the bass vibrate my chest, take it to the Midwest
Brought it back to the south, and bounce, out

[Verse 2: Rittz]
With my homie Tony footwork
Up in Kalamazoo, balling out up in the mall
We don't bounce 'til we spend a couple thousand on shoes
I'm repping clintel, how can I lose, you out of the loop
These music dudes were clueless who I was
'Til I blew, producing woohs and oohs and ahs
I'm the truth, what you confused? Are you surprised?
I refuse to lose, been booed and crucified
Disapprove the movement, crews get brutalized
If  these pooches choose to bite, get euthanized
I'm the new, the who is who gets neutralized
Twenty two's are huge, my shoes are supersized
Out on cruse, my music boomin' stupid loud
Bumping 8 Ball & MJG, from the outside looking in
I'm sitting on top of the world, but then again I kind of been lately
When I pull up in my Cadillac, my speakers got that rattle back
I'm flashin' back to when I was attacked by
A couple pretty bitches that was begging me to pick em up
And take em in and fuck em from the back side
But I ain't got no time to fuck around, I'm trying to buckle down
And focus on my money, so I stack my
Paper to the ceiling, I'm feeling like a billion
I'm filling up my cup with that crown and bounce out

[Hook: Rittz]

[Verse 3: Twista]
Smoking wood, then I’m gone
So far that you can’t even see me through the eyes of a telescope
Diamonds on my body, so appealin  jottin' down my feelins'
Acting like it was the realest shit I ever wrote
Mental telepathy is part of the recipe
That let me know that you want it
I'm giving it to you how you like it
Biology of a pimp, it be in the DNA
To know what you thinking
I’m speaking to you like a psychic
Lil mama know she lovin it so don’t try to fight it
I can make your life so appealing by the way I write it
Make it so she the only shawty I know
On Forgiatos, don’t hit no potholes
I roll up one and light it
On the passenger side of a ride
Like a player, Imma be up in the club talking the  big shit
Strange Music, we be the misfits
Come and twist Rittz, tisk tisk, cause you gon get your shit split
Middle of the map and nigga finna snap
And let em know the area continue to kill em forever, we on
Better be strong to live in the city I come from
And if you ain’t fucking with it then let it be known
And we can either talk about it or be about it
Me I’d rather sit back and blow an ounce
When I hear something like this up on the radio
All a nigga can do is just bounce

[Hook: Rittz][Verse 1 - Rittz]

I pull that Crown up outta that purple bag
Polo boots with my shirt to match
Pimpin' im leanin' my seat further back
Hit the gas in my bird then smash up 85 North we turnin' heads
Star status
Arm tatted
Out the window dudes lookin' hard at us
Cause they girlfriend wanna jump in they don't wanna fuck me man these hoes got a car fetish
But lets roll (roll roll roll)
Hit the pedal and lets ride
So much smoke pourin' out the window lookin' like the leather's on fire

[Hook - Mike Posner]

When I be drivin' in the car
Kicker in the back
Shotty in the front
Windows pitch black
Switch lanes (la la la) X2
When I be drivin' in the car
Session in the back
Hemi in the front so I ain’t worried bout' that
Switch lanes (la la la) X2

[Verse 2 - Rittz]

Speedin through GA like I’m ridin' in a General Lee
I re-revvin' up the engine when I'm in the street
My kickers beat you thought that a parade was coming
You probably thought that someone threw a grenade or something
You trynna' say you wasn't impressed please save it woman
Got you all up in the seat getting naked wantin' to make out
But you better not get no make-up on em'
These car jackers wanna follow me then take it from me
I got some heat up under my seat waitin on em
So why your face look funny homie you jealous of me
Cause I pull up on the scene so elegantly
Me and Mike P. together and we killin' the beat
We might of seen a little fame but we still in the street
From the the A all the way to the D
Throw the peace to the haters a hey when I see all the ladies come wavin' at me

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Mike Posner]

I ain't goin' nowhere
I ain't goin' home
I just need that tick tick
Followed by that (boom)
And that could get me high
Can you feel me
See I been wonderin' why
The only time I'm still me is

[Hook][Hook]
So you know I’m bout to K.I.L.L
People say I’m crazy maybe so I need to go and take a P.I.L.L
They should lock me up and throw away the key and put me in a C.E.L.L
They say they don't like the way I’m spitting fuck 'em they can go to H.E.L.L
For R.E.A.L. LET’S GO

[Verse 1]
Don’t play me man it’s kill or be killed
Fuck with me then blood is getting spilled on the field
I'm going crazy no refill on my pills
Ain't no use in anybody trying to tell me to chill, or cool off, cause the screws off
In my head ain’t tight they loose ya’ll better try ta get a move on, get a u-haul, dog, a Ryder truck
Before I slice you up and put your body in the boondocks
I was doing it when Busta was saying Woo Ha!
When Boyz II Men was the shit and was singing Doo-Wop
We was sticking two Phillies together calling 'em ooh-wops what you mad nobody knew who you was
Man, a brew buzz, wasn’t never enough we crushed anything we knew that we could toot up
Our nostril we pop pills and do bumps, falling out the sky like parachuters
Who wants drama wanna come and rumble with the champ, better not be on no weak shit, cause when it comes to rap I got it locked like it’s a prison camp
These little kids can scram or tell 'em bow down kiss the hand
When they get put in their place at first they wouldn’t embrace me now their faced with admitting that I got what it takes
And I’m a stay killing records tell 'em murders the case, until the day they consider me as one of the greats, I’m bout to…

[Hook]
K.I.L.L. people say I’m crazy maybe so I need to go and take a P.I.L.L

[Verse 2]
Here I come tell 'em bombs away and when I say that I’m coming that means I’m probably cumming on your baby mamas face, the shit’s easy I put on some Drake we Drank yellow tail Chardonnay and that was all it takes
I’m taking over so wake up and smell the coffee cakes, these other guys are fake they talk a lot but wouldn’t squash a grape
Don’t discombobulate them with me we are not the same, get out my lane, put on your breaks, and taste the marmalade
The fact I’m winning got you jelly, your hype is dying down now your record isn’t selling
Your pride got you too competitive and scared of failing, you chilling in the club and they like Rittz is in the building and it’s killing you
Any who, I be in a kiddie pool with liquor and some hoes these other rapper’s are miniscule
Anybody that’s coming at me can get it too, take it too far and end up kissing my tennis shoe
Now let me see your titties boo, cause all I see is pics of your kids on the internet no body wanna see them, we can be friends, we can pretend that it’s cheese dip on your face when we know it’s really semen
Let your knees bend and show the homies the bulls eye, Move ya booty like you was trying to hula hoop
My God, now suck it like you was bout to use a Hoover vacuum that dude is stupid in the booth I

[Hook]
K.I.L.L. people say I’m crazy maybe so I need to go and take a P.I.L.L

[Verse 3]
We drinking like Hank Williams and smoking like Willie Nelson, you betta try to hire Van Helsing
Or a monster killa homie cause no one can help them
Jealous of me cause I make the shit that nobody else can
I’m the long haired red-headed rapper that be showing out
On every single record other rappers bout to blow em out
The water it’s a slaughter why you talking shit you motor mouth
These motherfuckers adding up to no amount they know I’m bout to

[Hook]
K.I.L.L. people say I’m crazy maybe so I need to go and take a P.I.L.L

[Intro]
White boy [x6]

[Verse 1]
Nine deuce was the year my ears got introduced to rap
Stealing instrumentals off singles, I’d use the tracks
MC Pooh, Mellow Man, and Jeru the Damaja
"Tears" from the King  and I, was the few I had
Practiced in my room for hours, improved my craft
Bought every artist's album that I heard
On the song, "Bring It On", number fourteen
Till death do us part
Wishing that I was from the 5th ward of Houston bad
A white kid from the burbs, bumping 5th Ward boys
Too much trouble and Seag that Odd Squad Cassette
Up in class rapping bum stiggity bum, giggity gangsta gangsta
Biting Spice 1 and Das EFX
Kriss Kross and Method, Redman in my headphones
Blasting "Time Time 4 Sum Aksion"
That’s when then the teacher would get mad
And she would kick me out the classroom
The bell rang, start a cypher in the bathroom
Up inside the gym, take turns spitting
And beat the bleachers with our hands, tryin to keep the beat
Only white dude that went to my school that spit
Proved I’m sick, and I will eat MCs
I had room to grow, the talent show, I rocked the vest like Treach
Miami Hurricane hat while I held the mic
Haters talking shit like who, this fake Vanilla Ice
And I don’t care if he’s nice, on my life
I don’t like no white rappers

[Hook]
Growing up it was tough, my family said that I suck
They gave up, I was just a white rapper
But I created a buzz, cause I bust
In the booth, I go nuts, but I’m just a white rapper
Put in work to be dope, and I know that you think I’m a joke
Cause I’m just a white rapper
Put my heart on the stage, on the page
But at the end of the day, I’m still just a white rapper

[Verse 2]
In ninth grade, I kept getting better, by tenth
I was convinced I’d get a deal
My skills improved a hundred percent
Back then, nobody had studio equipment in their crib
I was the only one that did
I spent my life in that basement
On Cruse Road, up in Eagle Pointe
Cops labeled it a gang house, we was doing music
We dropped out, dreaming of being on
18 and 31, I would go out and perform
Open mics, where no one’s white
No one likes to clap or give you dap
Clubs you be scared to go inside
Stood at a spot in the hood, 20 miles from home
Waiting to finally hit the stage and blow their mind
Perform for 5 people, or 20 at best
Sending demo tapes to labels, a ton of rejects
A ton of fake record company execs saw my talent
And tried their best to convince me they had some to invest
And just wasting my time, phony managers scamming us
Girlfriend and family, the verdict unanimous
To "Stop rapping you piece of shit, it’s not happening
Now act white and grow up, are you trying to embarrass us?"
So I told that girl bye no one's stoppin stride
Rhymes kept getting better, my buzz was hard to deny
Almost quit and when I did got introduced to the guy
That put me on, and he'd been through the same struggle as I
A white rapper

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now the rap game is flooded with rappers
From every nationality, a ton of them crackers
The fact that I finally came up is miraculous
Twenty years later my name is becomin' established
My album is on the rack at Best Buy
I was at the BET awards, I was sitting right next ta
Luda and Rick Ross, but who woulda thought
I was just at Jim & Nick's, flipping chicken tenders and French fries
I used to hate when people asked me what I do for a living
It feels great to tell em you’re a musician
Until they ask what type of music, I tell 'em I rap
Then they laugh, looking at me, they be like "who are you kidding?"
I be like "Google me bitch,"
They always compare us white boys to one another
"Is your music like his?"
"You should be rich," "Freestyle," making stupid requests
Before I made it in music I never used to have shit
Now I got my own crib, I can afford my car
Fans say my music helps them when they’re goin' through hard times
I speak my mind even when I’m goin' too far
Even though a part of me agrees with Lord Jamar
We are guests in hip hop, I’m appreciative
That you finally let us in the crib
But I busted my ass to get respect for my craft
In interviews they never forget to mention this
That I’m just a white rapper

[Hook][B.o.B]
Yeah, uh-huh, uh-oh, no, damn

[Tech N9ne]
It-it-it-it-it-it that good Colora-

[Hook: B.o.B]
-Do, do, do, do
You know it's that fire
I can't get no higher
Do, do, do, do
I came to turn the night up
Now watch me as I light up

[Tech N9ne]
Hey, I smoke in Amsterdam, in Denmark, Christiana
Canada, then Germany, now everybody in this twist ganja
Now when I go to my second home big Tech is prone to conjure
Some of that new legal purple good Colorado-marijuana

[Stevie Stone]
Break it down, pearl it up, fire it up, pass it ‘round
Got that dope, eighth and a dream and cuddle with a purp when I'm in a town
Nobody fucks with regular, all my shit spectacular
Hit it for the low shit gotta be real loud, and this wild next to ya
Rhino rolling in the most, hydro mixed with indigo
Blaze that shit, really can't get no high, but niggas still feel me though
Chokin' though, blazin' fire, roll 'em up, mile high
Lovin' Colorado strawberry kush open wide

[Tech N9ne]
Put you lighters up in the sky when the nigga do it
For the homeboy Pakelika, Restin' in Reefer
Smoking that Keisha through a vaporizer with a feature
Tech N9ne, I'mma kick it every time
When I ease my mind, I hit my bottle
But they legalized it in my second home
When I go I'mma hit that good Colora-do

[Hook]

[Godemis]
You already know what it is, tappin' bottles, chippin' lips
Rollin' up another thumper, then we on the way to kill another gig
Info, Frizz, Stevie, Tech, Ubi and P-caso too
Chongin' out in the open, tokin' smoke so loud that I can't hear you
Look at me walkin' sideways, wavy but I'm not sloppy
And I'm burnin' down the bush, with the chief the spirits have got me
Better roll up, you know I'm cold as fuck, going nuts iffin' I'm up in your place
Takin' a hit of the purp I'mma hold it in and blow it in your face!

[Info Gates]
{*Cough Cough*} Info Gates {*Cough*} bitch don't hate
I showed up at the studio bars official
Cause I'm on trees like carved initials
I got that Candy Maldonado but I'm in KC, not Colorado
So if a cop finds this avocado
I got in this medicine bottle I gotta get, gone

[Ubiquitous]
Be hittin' the indica strain when it get in my brain
That it isn't the same, I'm twistin the flame
Light up, the Ces is definitely beneficial for the pain
That medical Jane, never synthetic
You know photosynthesis gettin' the blame
Blowin' the legit if you switchin' the state
Uh, blow the puff and I'm driftin' away
When I'm out in the Springs with a mountain to king
I'm countin the ounces they bring, they offer that kush (Kush)
They burnin' the bush, they 'bout it no doubt it's a thing
I'm jackin' the cyph, then I'm coming for Colorado
Over half of my life
I came from Arvada back in the day
Got a habit for packin' the sack in the pipe
I blowin' that in-

[Hook]

[Bernz]
Been an outlaw for minute though, smokin' out with no shame
Blowin' loud out of my sun roof back in the Sunshine State
But then boys offered that cake so it's a cat and mouse type chase
So I growin' eyes on my back and droppin' brims over my face
I need a high estate, elevate, gotta get back up to that Denver stage
Where the fans are Strange and the air is thin
But the smoke is thick I just can't explain
Sparkin', puffin', passin', ease your pain and all these forms of fashion
I think it's only right we celebrate it, just get

[Wrekonize]
Up-up high, get 'em up-up high
Stuck in the sky, we gotta lust let's fly
And I just met my angel dangled
With a halo and a bud supply
Went over limit and you heard the tale
About my freaked out tweaked out weed dungeon
But I forget about that when I'm in the 'DO
See I be all up on them Green Funyuns
Took another trip out to the CO
Where they be telling me the liberty is legal
So that's no whiz test for your PO
We go to free load and debo Doritos
Showing love to Metropolis
And the brother with the funk on the side of the curb
Green cross in a season of moss
When they all breed crops and they dying to serve

[Rittz]
Fort Collins to Boulder we smoke the air
We just feel wicked we on that Jodi Arias
Rollin' and jokin' these folks just stare at us
Trippin' for no reason when it's so hilarious
You high or something, you stared but you scared to puff
You wanna fly with me yeah have fans with lust
Just be careful when you hit it, I got admit it
I been known for sprinkle these orange hairs with dust
Forgot where we was, tried to order a Quarter Pounder
From a Taco Bell drive through high so we drove off
On the road lost blinded from the smoke fog
Made it to the crib I hit the door and then I dozed off
Broke off my homies a couple buds
And ever since the day I did it I got a bunch of phone calls
Ask me how much do an O' cost
In Atlanta got 'em smokin' on that dope dog ya-ya-yeah

[Krizz Kaliko]
When I'm in another land I smoke that fire-iah-iah
I don't really hit to choke but tonight I'm gonna try-iah-iah
Take some weed, mix it with tobacco leafs
Actually and breathe in and lose my faculties, naturally
(Okay) Worldwide now, following Tech Nina
Take another hit if you got that reefer
Bring me a little bit of that sativa
Baby tokes is my anxiety, don't like when I put it inside of me
I go back to the bottle, when I take a hit of that Colora-do[Intro]
Fuck swag (4x), Swag

[Verse 1]
15's in the back of the Dodge
Out the garage
And my homies riding with me and they better recharge
I talk about the clientele and tell 'em they won't be off
I'm off Atlanta representers and we're given the yonk
And be better this cars and the swap in the squad
They think they swagging but they lame as fuck we laugh at these boys
Uncontrollably like we just hit the gravity bong
Half of these rappers too wack to be even rapping and all
Trying to dress up like a wierdo hoping that somebody notice 'em
Make me wanna strike and knock em down like they a bowling pin
Maybe I’m just old and out of touch, attitude is fuck it
Cause If you don't like me go and watch some Nickelodeon, you lil motherfucker
I'm over and I stick 'em up they say they're YOLO go and then provoking
And it's hard time for me to tell the difference between a rapper and a singer
Of a rock and roll band I don't think this shit is appropriate
Way too many rappers wanna look like Lenny Kravitz
Personally I think these pussies get too many passes
Thrift store shopping with the shit your rocking
Looks lame and your music ain't neat the shit is average
And if that will make you matters even better
I don't sweat on people talking shit about the way I look every day
Long hair don't care, red pair of Air Jordans
And I wear all black, no hook

[Hook]
Fuck swag (x10)

[Verse 2]
All these rappers wanna bite like they don't know how to write
They constantly freestyle and think its tight
Every time they say a line with a metaphor in it
They wanna pause or laugh or ad-lib
Fake swag they just copy who they like
Trying to sound like Gucci or Future or Tunechi
These dudes need a lesson before they get behind the mic
Ain't nobody buying your records they buying into hype
They was feeling me until they see I'm white
Now they like "man he raps too fast"
What you slow homie? You handicapped?
What you need a walker, a hearing aid, or a fanny pack
What you unhappy the champ is back
The Manny Pac of the rap game that can't relax
I'm bout to raise the bar and they can't adapt, the cameras flash
Cause they see a star when I walk in the room
North side, Atlanta rap, I bet you wanna walk in my shoes
It's funny that I'm hot
Last year I was just cool when you
You was too official
Where the shoe that fits you
Tied yo' dick in skinny jeans, take your Louis belt and whip you
The clientele strip you of your jewellery, would take a pic
Post the shit on Instagram now suck a dick
You bitch, be looking real dumb
Still slum, I don't pleasant hear 'em
Bumping Big K.R.I.T. and Yelawolf I don't feel punk
Rappers with no skills come on witness me I kill them
You fucking with me I'm the real one

[Hook]
Fuck swag (x10)I'm on three shots of whatever
Three shots of whatever
Jagermiester, Jameson and Flaming Dr. Peppa that'll start me off correcta
Really don't suggest ya
Disrespect this dawg I'm drunk who's standing in my spot
Im next up, Bet ya
Never heard of me but you about to find out
I was in a hole but Yela Helped me climb out
I'm back and now these rappers gotta sit in time out
Coming from Atlanta baby give a pimp a wipe down
With your girlfriend and I got her in a night gown
Going down on my pipe like wow wow
I'm bout to bust one here dear swallow my child
While I blow white clouds on some high priced loud
With your fists like like like like lights out
Pull a knife get sliced right by your eyebrow
We gone like chow!
See ya later right now
Where the fuck is my crown, we ain't drinking Ice House
Slumerican the crew that i rep and I vow
The clean house rappers so my buzz will die down
My style 's unorthodox no discriminating pussy take Porche Fox
And give Courtney Cox a go rah
Get a phone call saying I'm the baby daddy, Naw surely not
I'm on fire more like sorta hot
I'm high like it's twenty past four o'clock
Better try to secure your spot
Can't ignore this bitch I got 'em sweatin like they shittin in a port-a-jon
Rap Mortal Kombat get folded like Origami
I was bored and lonely last year
This year I was touring, boning any girl that want my penis like I'm organ doning
That line probably gonna make my chick get mad
It's sad trying to rap pussy whipped this bad
This bitch ass game ain't ready for me
White kids say they never heard nobody spit this rad
What is this mishap?
Who let em get past?
While I sit back watching and my feet kicked up
Down three more shots and i take a deep breath I'm bout to kill em when the beat switch up
Your girl want me to autograph her titty at a show
I told her we back in the Marriott she wanna go
I said that she coming and bring a friend along with her
She gotta fuck the whole posse and when it's over adios
Who you know that's fucking with me?
Anybody even close?
When I said it to em they was looking like they seen a ghost?
Claiming that they want to travel all around the globe
But I still rep 770
They call me Rittz...BITCH. White Jesus[Hook: Jelly Roll]
And I don't give a fuck
What you say about me
I don't care what you say about me
And I don't give a fuck
What you say about me
I don't care what you say about me
And I don't give a fuck

[Verse 1: Jelly Roll]
It's still [?] zone
And I keep them gangsters round me
They talking shit but really
They don't know a thing about me
Cops asking questions then I pull my disappearing act
'Fore this rap I sold it cheap
Like it was on a clearance rack
And I'm still the same dawg
Ain't shit changed dawg
I can rap with eyes closed while juggling chainsaws
It's easy, man it's nothing to a G
When it comes to me
Now ain't nothing for the free

[Hook]

[Bridge: Jelly Roll]
What you drink, don't make me piss
And what you eat, don't make me shit
Now
And I don't give a fuck
What you say about me
I don't care what you say about me
I'mma be me

[Verse 2: Jelly Roll]
It's Fat Man Jones
Incase you fuckers forgot
Look at a super bad bitch
Like are we fucking or not?
Now whenever she need it
I know who she gonna call first
Cause I fuck her good
And eat that pussy till my jaws hurt
Now I'm off in Hollywood
And they like 'there that man again'
And I'm country as a sumbitch
How's your mommi now?
Hit a lick for half a brick
And plus a thousands good pills
Got it free and sold it cheap
I feel like the Goodwill
Man I fuck with Tech N9ne
I swear I'm so Strange with it
Insane in the brain with it
I go David Blaine with it
Tell my publicist to call that I need a kitchen
Cause I'm fat and I'm funny and I'm famous
Peter Griffen

[Hook + Bridge]

[Verse 3: Rittz]
I'mma log onto Youtube now, read the comments
I don't give a fuck about, what a hater gotta say
But every now and then
I let them get under my skin and cuss 'em out
Well here's one, someone said my songs are boring
I'm fat and I have an annoying voice
But all the bitches say my voice is smooth
And I'm fly flamboyant like I'm georgous George
And you ain't gotta listen to my shit
The choice is yours, well here's another one
Here's someone who done said I was a wannabe
What you mean? wanna be what? wanna be rich? hell yeah
I don't wanna be struck, being broke man
The shit will make you wanna eat rust
Slumerican apparently you wanna be us
But I bet you really wanna eat one of these nuts
Now you someone that I see and wanna beat up
Having trouble, keep it
I got a good laugh when I got on Facebook
And said I'm finally rich
Somebody else said I look like Suzie top
But this is hair, not a beard, what you roger bitches?
Thinking I do meth, I'm a coke head, oh well
People gonna make accusations
And I don't snort coke everyday, but I do on special occasions

[Hook + Bridge][Verse 1]
Take 85 north to Gwinnett to my stompin' ground
People sleepin' on my counter
Now it's time to wake em' up, smell the coffee ground
Bout' to steal the spotlight
Snort snow and I flow feel the frostbite
We sellin' ice cream, I ain't talking Klondikes
Crystal meth, and it's crystal clear
Reporting live from Gwinnett like I'm Walter Cronkite
So ya'll might wanna keep a pistol near
Devo on the board, hear the engineer
What's the deal, pickle spear? Smoke a hog leg
After that I'ma bounce to the crib with this bitch cause she got my dick stiffer than a frog leg
Have her soundin' like she ball-gagged
Bust a nut then I dip out I'm Jimmy Carter
Motherfuckers wanna look hard from they whip, but 26
I ain't playin' with you kindergartners
It's the infamous Rittz, aka White Jesus
Alias Jonny Valiant
I hope when I come across to you it's on
Cause if you step you'll get tossed like a pasta salad
So, excuse me junior, got a QP in my underwear right next to my huge kahunas
And it's not for sale homie, it's personal
[?] brought it through the terminal
My heart's still from the bay, bay, bay all the way to the A, A, A
I'ma take a little hit then I'll do a little yay', yay'
Got the hookup on the customized J's
Everybody look amazed when they checkin' out the footwork
Sayin' who the fuck is Rittz and the Cli-N-Tel comin' out the woodwork
Puffin' good herb, yuh uh yeah

[Hook]
I got a cup full of Captain Morgan, a mango blunt wrap filled with kush
Got a gram and a half to snort and my fingernails smell like a ganja bush
I put my Xanax bars in the cellophane and when you givin' me dirty looks
I'ma wash it down with this Captain Morgan, the party don't stop till After Mornin' (x2)

[Verse 2]
All the ladies in the crowd raise your hand if you're tired of your man and you wish you had something new
Ok, I see a couple few. You, you, you, to suddenly the number grew now listen
All the girls with their hands in the air that is tired of their man wantin' somethin' new
Congrats girl, you're invited backstage, afterwords you can fuck my crew
It feels like Utopia, we livin' la vida coca, man
I feel the line slide down my throat and drain, then chase it with a Crown and Coke
Till my body's floatin' like a big banana boat
Try to kill my high and I'ma split your cantaloupe right in half like a nut shell
Tell the cops that you got drunk, fell, tried to run somewhere that's the reason for the motherfuckin' blood trail "Rittz, just chill"
I'll be in an all black presidential Caddy '06 DeVille
Still with the original wheels smokin' pure kush, shit
"What's your name there white boy?" George Bush, bitch
[?] it's neon green
I had it in my pocket, you can smell it on my Shean John jeans
My Sean John jeans, eyes chinkin' like a Chinese ping pong team
Now a mark tryin' to find me a ding-dong fiend with a drug habit
Got some porn star e pills
I'mma take her to the crib, get her freaky as fuck
And when tomorrow come around, tell my boys the details
Some say I go overboard, and the thought that my heart might explode before
When my nose was sore, I just smoked some more
When my lungs are done, that's what the coke is fore

[Hook]
I got a cup full of Captain Morgan, a mango blunt wrap filled with kush
Got a gram and a half to snort and my fingernails smell like a ganja bush
I put my Xanax bars in the cellophane and when you givin' me dirty looks
I'ma wash it down with this Captain Morgan, the party don't stop till After Mornin' (x2)[Intro]
All around the world
All around the world

[Verse 1:]
I'm just a kid from the G.C
Who would've thought you would see me
On MTV one day, I done came a long way from printing up CDs
Up in the basement on Cruse Road
Used to do shows with no cameras there
Now I'm doing shit in the House of Blues in LA
On stage a whole crowd is cheering me on
Disappear when we gone
Up in the tour bus on to the next state
The last one was eleven weeks long
Friends saying you made it Rittz
You don't play the shit
Eating dry egg stakes on a Vegas trip
Die hard fans that be showing up
They like, "Hey, would you please sign my ladies tits?"
I'm like, fine
You can touch them Rittz I don't mind
I say congratulations on your ladies tits
You got pics don’t put em online
Cause my girl might trip out
Me and her we done had a hard time
7 years we ain't never had a dime
Even though it ain't much it, I feel like I'm getting rich now
I just signed a deal so I'm a get it now
I told Tech and Trav I won't let them down
It's an honor to be a part of Strange Music
A label that's down to go to the extra mile
And I could crack a smile without faking it
Cause a few people knew me in the A
Now I got dudes over in the UK
They getting tattoos of my face they know me all...

[Pre Hook]
Man ya gotta understand like...
I'm so grateful to be in the position I'm in, you know
I been, I been doing this shit for 15 years
It took, it took me 15 years to get to this point
It's real shit

[Hook]
All around the world
All around the world
They know me all around the world
All around the world

[Verse 2]
One time for the homies in Toronto
Fans say that they feel me in Montreal
2 years ago if it wasn't for no bad luck
I'd probably wouldn't have no luck at all
Had to drive my car to do spot days
My piece of junk would stall, not knowing who to call
Shit over heated in Tennessee
Hundred degree weather stranded by Ruby Falls
I'm like no...
Danny Boone, Dean Jones
Help me expand my fan base
When I was dead broke they would throw me some cheese for shows
And that's real
We done stayed in some shitty hotels
Sleeping on top of the covers, wearing socks in the showers
And not knowing if the shit would go well
On stage on the country hall but nobody knew me
Opening for rehab again
5 months later I was on headline
Cheap Jynx Burn One come at me went
Across country fans buyin' tickets just to come see
Me, on my own I ain't had nobody fund me
3 star hotels used to be a luxury
Now we're getting kicked outta' of this for disrupting
Smoking weed, drinking crown
Celebrating Lincoln town
Cars would take us to the after party
Weird I was begging for my pick and out
And I'm blessed but now I gotta go and get more
I was just a kid in Gwinnett with a dream
Tryna' be like Dre and Big Boi
Now they know me all...

[Pre Hook]
Shit, man I'm so lucky man
To be in the position I'm in, you know what I'm saying
You know how many musicians never get discovered
And got talent and shit
I'm getting to live my dream, you know
I just bought a new car and shit
I ain't never had a new car. Yea

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Third verse I'm a dedicate to my homies
Slick boy, Chico, freaky freeze
What up Ralo, trans ain't held me down
But thank God they believed in me
My boys mandatory Irish nut
We hit a motherfucker if we start the but
Shortcut name Rittz and kids named me White Jesus
Look what you started bro that's love
Dallas I done finally came up
For the days and back in 9th grade for the football
Game trying to sound like Bone Thugs
And to the friends I miss
Growing up and we had to part ways
We was young and said it would all change
But its still Clintel homie that is always
Pay homage to my rapping friends we're all vulnerable
Praying one day that we get to live our dreams
They told me the talent is valuable
But truthfully timing is everything
It's unfair
That's why I gotta thank my fans
I could be the best rapper alive but without them nobody really give a damn now they know me all...

[Pre Hook]
Thank you. Naw for real, thank you
I mean you could have all the co-sings in the world, you know
But without fans really, really feeling your music
Really liking your shit, you ain't shit
And I'll never forget that, thank you so much
Yu-uh-yea

[Hook][Verse 1: Rittz]
It's a problem when you
Can't afford to eat shit but a double cheese from the dollar menu
Gotta pay in quarters
Bitch behind the window pissed she sick of taking orders
Shit aren't we all
Ridin round on E waitin for the car to stall
With a engine cut chick lookin in the mirror puttin on lipstick wishin that she lookin like a barbie doll
Infatuated with all the stars in hollywood wanna wear what the rappers wore
Buy shoes that you can't afford
With no gas in your car to go to the packer store to get a pint of martins
Wishin you could drink ciroc I had a brand new watch that didn't turn your wrist green its not cool to shop at K-Mart
Girls gonna start thinkin your twat
You start hustlin you was doin it a bit
Now you locked up facin the face of time
Every time you call home your lady cryin
Talk about her period late and I'm pregnant no you ain't what you think I'm blind
The doc say It's a boy we gon name him Brian
He said first we gon make sure the baby mine
I know you out there fuckin bitch thinks I'm blind


[Hook: Jihad]
Sometimes it feels like there ain't no hope
When all you see is darkness it's hard to blow
Holdin' to the scars so the pain don't show
Holdin' to the past 'cuz we can't let go
Don't blame us 'cuz it's all we know
This is all we know (X2)


[Verse 2: Rittz]
Luxuries
Got a couple bucks in my pocket next to my cutlass keys
Don't gotta tuck my piece
Gotta couple soldiers with me attention at ease
With no associate degrees but still better than a drug disease
We confused and lost
Poppin. Loritab, Roxy, Oxy contin
...goin through withdrawals...no mood...
Called my homeboy trynna shoot the shit. "Hello"
Dude its Rittz what the hell been up?
He said that he fell in love with some stupid bitch in one month she was movin in
Everything goin good then his boo done went and left him for a minute, had loot to spend
Now he said he feels stupid, said he gonna shoot her, see the tool homie gonna do em in
All I could say was keep your head up
He said what is that? Never mind dog It was good to catch up
Feelin that though he never really had love
We all done bad shit doesn't add up
Laying with a bad bitch on a mattress
So the dude like me can't get a back rub
These days we pray please holla back god
But I guess you gotta take the good with the bad so

[Hook: Jihad]

[Verse 3: Rittz]
All she wanted was to have some kids
And a husband, love and happiness
Sayin' where does a life like that exist?
No family, she ain't seen daddy since she came out the womb with a bunch of bastard kids who got dissed with the disadvantages
So the optimism vanishes
Made a wish when she lit the candle stick
Like God hear me out
I appreciate you
I don't wanna seem like I'm being ungrateful
I'm lucky that I'm livin I ain't been no angel
But ever since grade school shit has been painful
I don't owe a person a explanation
How am I to live up to your expectations
I'm addicted to meth to say that I'm depressed is an understatement
Estimation. Need some medication or at least some love
My boyfriends cheatin, he beats me up
Gotta best friend but shes strung out too
When I talk to her she says join the club
And I dont wanna die but I'm losin my will to live
Please God forgive
In the name of Jesus I pray Amen
She hit the chittle again cause that's all she know[Verse 1:]
Cameras flashing
Spot lights getting hot on me like
Turn this suntan to ashes
And you cannot match it
I done blew up
And covered the competition in volcanic ashes
Let us trend the fashion new clothes a plus
Yelawolf changed my life so much it chokes me up
You talk about me when I was broke and
He gave me the hope I lost
And now I'm gone on the road so much
And I know you're lonely love
I just wish we could touch through the phone but just
Stay focused and note that I'm trying to make a living for the both of us
And when the chuckle up
I might close enough to finally buy us a car
With her own apartment he embark a dream
On stage in saw to rin
A shy town thinking that you'll get drunk and screams
I'm a feel like a sailor of a sicker submarine
Tryin to keep both of our heads above the water
I know you want kids but we live with your mom
How the fuck am I supposed to become a father
When I'm spending my last hundred dollars on studio time
But you ain't ever gave a fuck about bread
I'm a give you the life you deserve one day
While you crying all alone in our bed
I'm on the bus and the bunk
Having dreams barbequing with a back yard for the dog to run
Been gone so long it feels weird talking on the phone
I freaking knew it I be coming home
Fuck rap, you're my backbone
When I'm at home with you it's like I'm really in my comfort zone
A thousand miles away looking at the sky and pray
And tell God you ain't all alone

[Hook:] (Mike Posner)
Cause I've been thinking about you all day
And I've been walking down this hallway
And now your love just seems so far away
But maybe that's the way it's always gon be
And every day my heart aches
I'm just sitting in this dark place
And now your love just seems so far away
But maybe that's the way it's always gon be

[Verse 2:]
Fights on facebook
All you see these pics they took with me
You can't believe the hype
Every night we fight about girls you see
On the internet, thinking I'm cheating
And I gotta defend myself from bullshit you accused me
You play gotta do music though
Think I'm all late tripping getting groupie love
Crying to me is unnecessary
Losing you is the last thing I want
If only you could trust, then I'd miss you as much as you miss me
And I wish we could be on the couch together
But we ain't got no cheddar
No kind of credit history can we deserve better
Can't accept the mysery I know you had a real hard life
And it's harder when I'm gone
And I promise you one day shit will make sense
It will be alright
I sent flowers to your job today
I put my headphones on and I played our song
No I mean the bicycles I just got done
Sorry that you had to wait up long
So many nights when we get up on each other
Really fighting cause I can't come home
Got a hotel room just to face time with you tonight
Don't put make up on
Because your face just looks so beautiful
And I promise that I'm always gonna be true to you
So many people travelling in pursue of true love
But never get the feeling that I do from you
So many human beings tryin live their whole life with their soulmate
But I found mine
While you laid up in the house crying
We both been counting on time

[Hook:]
Cause I've been thinking about you all day
And I've been walking down this hallway
And now you love to see so far away
But maybe that's the way it's always gon be
And every day my heart aches
I'm just sitting in this dark place
And now you love to see so far away
But maybe that's the way it's always gon be(Intro)
(Phone Rings)
Pick up the fuckin' phone, pick up the goddamn phone
Ah fuck, oh goddammit
Baby if you get this call me back immediately this is a fuckin' emergency
I, I think I did too much shit my fuckin' heart feels like it's about to shut down
So call me back, quick as fuck please. Bye

(Verse 1)
Cocaine in my nostril hair
White lines chopped up on a cloudy mirror
Heart beat tellin’ me to slow it down
I ain't listenin’ and I can hear it loud n’ clear
My ribcage’s clinchin’ I’m pourin’ sweat
Still tryna snort lookin’ for a drip
Trippin’ out knowin’ I did too much
Havin’ a panic attack I feel short of breath
I shut the bathroom door n’ wet my face hopin’ that the water might cool me off
Tryna throw up in the toilet to get it out my system my nose started pourin’ blood
And that made it worse, the blood stained my shirt, im contemplatin’ wakin’ my parents up
Tellin’ the truth I’m overdosin’ on coke but maybe it’ll go away I’m just paranoid
I went back in the room and I shut the door
Got some Xanax to the dresser drawer
Here I go again mixin’ uppers and downers the sound of my heart like a tug o’ war
Cause all I heard as I laid in bed “please God lemme live I promise I will never do drugs no more”
Closed my eyes an realized that I wasn’t sure
I calmed down and I snorted more like goddamn

(Hook)
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
But if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take
Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen
Let me see another day again

(Verse 2)
Holes in the gloves of the homeless man
Freezin’ as bad as the cold cement
On the corner beggin’ with an open hand
The weather man said it’s probably gunna snow again
There more holes in his clothes that expose his skin
Sick with pneumonia he’s old an slim
Hopin’ when somebody walks by and sees him freezing they may throw him a coat
The wind is unbearable, he hasn’t ate in days
Diggin’ through the trash find a burger that’s halfway eaten some packets a mayonnaise
Beggin’ all day nobody gave em change
He just lays in waste below the underpass
Last year he done almost froze to death
But this winter is much colder
The homeless shelter too full now there’s no one left to come rescue him
He’s outta breath they can’t give him a second wind the snowfall arrives
Prayin’ out loud “please God I apologize for anything I done wrong” he cried
He can’t feel his fingers his legs is numb
But everyone else is at home warm inside
He’s up under the bridge bout to freeze to death
Singin' to God I don’t wanna die like dear Lord

(Hook)

(Verse 3)
Life of her was so promising
Popular, a homecoming queen
Dreamed a becoming a doctor one day
She’s smart so her grades were astonishing
Her boyfriend gave her a promise ring
It was a prime example of puppy love
They act as if they was attached at the hip
Every time you saw one they was coupled up
Neither one of them drunk that much
But one night they got the invite to go n‘ drink with friends
It was started out to be a normal night
But change the course her life and have a tragic end
And then 10 shots later said they had to leave
Her friend said stay you okay to drive?
One of the dudes tried to take her keys
She said please you’re trippin’ I’m okay I’m fine
She got behind the wheel her boyfriend was trashed
On the highway goin’ way to fast
Hit a sharp corner round a bend and crashed
Her boyfriend’s head went through the windshield pass
Her neck gashed wide open her ribs are broken her boyfriend’s gone in the car he died
She hangin’ on waitin’ for the Jaws of Life to get her out
And she started to shut her eyes and she said God

(Hook)[Verse 1: Rittz]
Self, self-pity, self-self pity
Why the fuck is everybody else giddy?
I woke up and felt shitty
Matter fact I felt the same all week
Let down like my last album on the shelf sitting
And I think I might need help getting out of bed
Cause I'm here and I keep spinning out of thread
I'm my own worst critic and I gotta write a album
But I keep hating on myself, it's like I get obsessed
Cause I hate what I write, say something tight
I be thinking too much wondering what they gonna like
I don't got a lot of fans, I'm afraid that I might
Let 'em down if what I make don't relate to them right
If it don't, then they ain't gonna buy my record
And if my second doesn't sell better than the last
I'mma owe the record label cash
So it's hard to relax and write raps
I be losing concentration sometimes
I look at what they saying online
Somebody unfollowed me and call me out cause I ain't respond
I'm behind on my deadline and I got a home life
To juggle ain't no free-time
My manager clowning, "what you write another deep song?
What is it this time, your lady, your struggle trying to be some{thing}?"
Not in the mood to write a weed song
I take the beat and give myself a mental beat-down when I rap

[Chorus: Rittz]
I'm my own worst enemy the energy I have's a waste
Cause I use it battling myself cause I'm a basket case
(Da, da, da, da) I'm a basket case
(Da, da, da, da) I'm a basket case
Staring at this glass of whiskey, wishin' I would pass away
But I'm always wishing for the worst cause I'm a basket case
(Da, da, da, da) I'm a basket case
(Da, da, da, da) I'm a basket case

[Verse 2]
I can't have conversation with rappers
I'm not an asshole to anyone unless I have a reason to be
But God forbid if they ever had a buzz or a name
Then they feel like we are equal, and these dudes always want a feature for free
I try to network and help 'em out, I just gave 'em a tweet
But I'm starting to wonder if the shoe was on the other foot
Would these motherfuckers do the same favor for me?
But, on the other hand, people think I'm all famous
I ain't half as paid as you think, when I tell 'em what the price is
To get me on a record they act like it's too expensive just to pay me a G
And I'm starting to feel guilty
Cause I'm known as the guy who never quit and never gave up his dreams
So a bunch of dudes tell me that I gave them motivation
Not to quit and they gon' try to do the same thing as me but
Only difference is, I spent fifteen plus years studying my favorite MCs
So I kept getting better some of y'all ain't got it, can't hear it, but it's blatant to me
And I don't want to hurt their feelings so I tell 'em that the music that they making is tight
But your image looks bad, and you suck, and you need to give up, and you're wasting your life
And it's all my fault... damn

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
They tell me that I need to tweet more, but I feel kind of immature, typing my thoughts online
Plus the fans that I got will probably hate me if they knew what type of shit that crossed my mind
Cause I hate rap
Let me take that back, I just hate whack rappers for the most part
Even though I rap fast, I don't like when people try to impress me with double-time
And they be swearing that they go so hard
They don't really even say shit
Anyone can rhyme, thinkin' and drinkin' and sinkin'
Inside my Lincoln and think it's dope, it ain't about the speed
You gotta make it make sense
And did I mention that I really hate fake fans?
I don't understand how one minute everyone could be on your dick and they say you hot
A year later the same fans steady be talkin' shit 'bout that rapper Actin' like they forgot
That's how the shit works
First they love you, then they hate you, then they love you again
You gotta toughen your skin
This kind of shit hurts
This music industry is dumb, dumber than the comments on YouTube
Saying that I use the N-Word? (Hell Naw)
I don't rap like that, I don't hang around white boys who act like that
I done said too much, 'bout to snap, I'm mad
At the world, even I don't really have my back when I rap it's like... damn

[Chorus]Juyeah, yeah
Live from the backroom, baboon
I'm an animal and I blow like boom
Every lyric that you hear feeling like a stab wound
Leave his stomach in the clouds, shining like had moon
Get your nose broke, get your eyes black, raccoon
Slow poke hating my raps smack goons, in the mouth
Schooling rappers, welcome to the classroom
Independent kill the majors, they can smell the gas fumes
My Cadillac vroom, 85 North
A-town homie we ain't riding skateboards
My boys hit a lick cuz they ain't trynna pay for it
Down on my luck hear me when I pray Lord
Rapping for the underground until im in a graveyard
They be routing for me on the T.V screen
White got soul like im BB King, a rock star like im B. Springsteen
You wanna battle ring the bell homie, ding ding ding
Dodging bullets p-p-ping ping ping
Everybody be ducking 'em when im smoking looking greener then a string green bean
Up in a cutlass dummy she seen me on the shelf in the store, my album out
Its The Life and Times of Jonny Valiant, now
Go and get it if you like what your hearing, if you didn't you don't know what your talking 'bout
Yuh uh yeauh
Strange Music, Slumerican, Northside A-town[Verse 1: Wax]
You watching this, I don’t need your co-sign
Regardless I’ll be chilling up in the hammock in no time
Hawaian coast line, my girl’s so fine
Bikini blow-drying up on the clothes line
No mind on the bovine
I puked up the blue pill we were forced to eat
I’m intolerant to the lactose in the corporate teet
I’m starting not to want to participate or compete
Weren’t we meant to live a life more complete
You know there’s people in Peru right now that are hunter gatherers
And many recent studies have found that they’re happier than we are
I’m to rapping what the Kardashians are to PR
Preface my name with a D-R, huh
But I made a plan to kick the game in its smelly rectum
And I don’t deviate like a healthy septum
I’m the truth and it hurts fools
Yeah go type Wax in ya Youtube search tools
And buy some merch fools

[Verse 2: Rapsody]
Despite Sprite I thrist for mics
Like the look on racists' face if Kanye was Christ
It’s unbelievable, put fear in a poltergeist
He shaking twice, spit something that the Pope won’t like
I’m hoping Mike will understand my ultralight
Like a Sosa night run home to momma, damn she nice
Moonwalking, I’m just a talking and it’s really all light
10% dis or I can give you 90 tonight
Hurting for life, turn ‘em blue like I’m Walter White
Couldn’t face me with Skype, ‘til we cake like Tina and Ike
At your throat boy, fly like Elliott’s bike
Extraterrestrial flow, I’m so outta they sight
In the stars, where Kendrick threw bars, you was abroad
That G5 praying to God, I brought in the squad
And look how I bodied it like Playboy cards
Now they outta control like I said I'm the Queen of New York
It’s rap

[Verse 3: Emis Killa]
Today we are going out baby it’s wow
I bring you to the moon, say hi to the world
You purr and say “miao” and I’ll bring you the Chanel
I take five stars from the sky and I put them in this hotel
Brr, I’m more than cold, I’m Sub-Zero
The sun kisses beautiful people
And I burn like a vampire
Get undressed, enjoy the tropical sea
Which is the end of the world fuck 2012 off
If I would have fistfight and would take a lot
I’ll fall down but the on a red carpet
I’ve got so much swag that if we go around
People don’t know what I see
The panorama or my shoes
I’ve got a watch that shines so much that
I don’t even see what fucking time it is
I treat you as q queen, because I’m a king
If I were Christ, I would wear the gold edition crown of thorns

[Verse 4: Rittz]
I’m getting paid, I finally made it
But haters don’t’ want to see me win
Well I hate the word swag
I hate people that say "my G" and "fam"
I hate "I gotta listen", I’m what Hip Hop is missing
After this one they’ll consider me competition
For the record just because you rapping like you mad
Don't mean you snapping, you just sounding raspy
In Atlanta we don’t ride to that
I bet he get body bagged
I bet he wouldn’t win a boxing match
I’m quick on my feet, I could dodge a jab
You run up, you gunna run out of gas
Cause I'm on top and I'm rhymin'
And choppin' like I was in Karate class
Ya body get sawed in half
You're faker than a knock-off Prada bag, off my launching pad
Dunkin’ on ‘em like I’m Dominique
Reppin’ Strange my chain is stuntin’ on 'em, bada bing!
Off the chain I should probably party with Charlie Sheen
From the South but I wasn’t brought up like Paula Dean
And y’all are lame I’m ‘bout to X y’all out
I write whatever so fuck it if I let Nas down
Yeah, uh-yeah, get my album

[Verse 5: Jon Connor]
Yo the flow is timeless like a diamond
So when I’m rhyming, I’m mining
They said I was stuck in the rough
And you was just lucky to find it
You was foolish as Frankie Lymon
If you decided to try it or fight it
This is Andre the Giant vers' Daniel Bryan
Yes you want it hot, well allow me to change the climate
If the shoe was on the other foot you wouldn’t even know how to tie it
Somebody tell Rita Ora I sort got feelings for her
Got a crib out in Georgia we could raise a son and a daughter
Or we could go out to Florida where the weather is just as gorgeous
Baby I ain’t playing no games like I ran out of quarters
Hold up this is getting outta hand
‘Cause in a year I'mma be saying I’m not her man
Doin’ the U are not the father dance
‘Cause this is Michigan, proof feminine rappers be talking
Ain’t nobody genuine, I be killing it
They can’t touch him, everybody feeling it
But look I cleared out all y’all that got in the way
And y’all knew that I was ill, but now my doctor is Dre
Aftermath, AVM, Flint, MichiganHook: [Jarren Benton]
Woke up and I feel just like a billion (bucks) x3
They gone hate, but we don't give a billion (fucks) x3
I'm in VIP I'm with a billion (sluts) x3
Everyday I feel just like a billion (bucks) x3

[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
Uno, dos, tres, leggo
Y'all sucka ass niggas soft like Jell-O
Pull up in the Trans-Am, nose on the whole gram
Of the white girl nigga, Jay Othello
Kick a nigga door for the k-i-l-o
Blunt full of kush make a nigga feel mellow
Sayonara to the bad guy to the .45 in the SK muthafucka say hello
Hello, hi, me I'm high, mesmerized by neon lights
Bitch you know I'm throwed off, doctor said I'm not right
Got a white bitch but shes not bright
If the bitch'll blow a nigga for his Snickers then imagine
What the ho would do for a Klondike!
Feelin' like a billion
And then I'm about to kill again
He's on his own island bet them niggas think I'm Gilligan
No resilience I'll pop a nigga, drop a nigga Heath Ledger nigga
I'ma pop a little pill again
What up to my homie Ned Fresh up out the pen again
I shove a muthafucka's head right inside the ceiling fan
Leave a pussy nigga shaking in his Timberlands
D-d-d-d stuttering and tr-tr-tr-tr-trembling
Wake up feeling like a billion bucks
Bitch get to steppin' if you don't fuck
I need a ho to give me futuristic head
Blow me in the space ship, call the bitch, Aeon Flux
Fall off in the club with the heat on tuck
This my year y'all be on suck
Gone off that Charlie Sheen that tiger blood bitch we goin' nuts like

[Hook: Jarren Benton]

[Verse 2: Rittz]
Okay Jarren, dog I know they scared
When they see me and you together man it's so unfair
The way we killin' these rappers I bet there's no comparin'
Not a fan of they music I hate the clothes they wearin'
And I'm so embarrassed, at the state of my city
Cause everybody rep they hood in the white boy spot
But when they really in the hood, try and tell 'em where they from
They be lookin' at 'em like, "Boy, stop!"
But not me I'm from the north side, feeling like a billion
I'm a Slumerican, honkey-town affiliate
I'm with a resilient, bitch who let me drill her
Afterwards she call me up and say she never wanna chill again
It's too unsafe, my crew untamed, the shit true
My black friends always rob my white friends
My white friends get drunk and start fighting each other
And when they bloody they be like, "Are we tight man?"
And this red light, damn, and this ain’t sharp rap
Drop that shit on the internet when I see you
I'ma tuck my hair inside of my sock hat, cock back
And swing at your jaw, SMACK, somebody better tell him to fall back
The southern hip-hop's Josh Koscheck, prob'ly got a weapon in the Octagon
I'll stop you while my Jimmy Scotts is on
What you thought, come on, it’s my time man your watch is wrong
I’m gone, I’m on a whole 'nother playing field
My name is still buzzin' the fuckin' streets are watchin'
Rollin' up the Sour Deez in the Cut' Supreme
I could spend this cream in the Neiman Marcus
Lookin' clean, you are steamin' -- heap of garbage
You could scheme, homie I’ma be me regardless
People talk a lot of shit, ‘cause I’m an easy target
Eatin' xani bars, drinkin' Thompson, it got me feelin' like a billion...

[Hook: Jarren Benton]

[Verse 3: Jon Connor]
Flints own, Flintstone, made this buzz on his own
You ain’t on ya grind, but I stay on mine
So what y'all do? Piss, moan
Y'all niggas real fake, my nigga's Bill Gates
Killin' the industry what a difference a year make!
I’m here for your ear sake, you wanna hear great?
You fuck outta luck, I can hear the mirror break
You niggas so basic -- fly
The 'Stairway to Heaven' yo it lead to my basement
Based in the fucking basement it’s amazing
The Matrix that I haze 'em can't save ‘em
Hits give ‘em Canseco on site, I’m a psycho when I write tho like a rifle
Took all of my rivals, I swear that I bless every track (yup)
Hand on the Bible
Backyard, H squad
I came out the hood nigga just like y’all
Love how I stand on my own two feet
But the haters they pray that I just might fall
Nah, never that, I drop classics, nigga, gimme that
See how my name buzz on the internet
If it’s me against the world then I’m winning that
See? Look, my niggas struggle like five in the bank
You bullshittin' like five in the tank
See I, grind for mine, I earn my shine
So I ain’t got another nigga to thank
Moe Cleaves gave me game at a young age
Say niggas only read what's on the front page
And I know that’s true, so he looked me in my eye and say
"Do what you gotta do to make sure that’s you!" Connor...

[Hook: Jarren Benton][Intro: Rittz]
Yeah... They don't really want it with us. Yeah... Yeah... Yeah...

[Verse 1: Rittz]
Shit my flow's aggressive
I've been told that it's so impressive
Might have heard me on a smoking session
Sounding nasally but mainly cause my nose was messed up
I been out in California snorting blow with Ke$ha
There's no one fresher
But no one ever compliments me
So many dope white boys out now I'm chopped liver
But if you want Rittz then this is what I'll give you
This simpleton in me, I brought the rest of the South with us
The smell of my outfit it's so loud on the cloud thickest
So I don't got not time to pay attention to gossipers
Slumerican the clique if they ain't with us they not winners
Monstrous platinum murdering you are now witness
Run for cover thought I was bluffing on dime bitches
Your five fingers only thing the Troopers done found
The rest of your body dumped in the Chattahoochee to drown
You fucked around and shit so don't be trying to punk me it's gon' be a bloody-

[Hook] x2
MURDAH!
You step to Rittz up in this bitch; it's about to be a bloody-
MURDAH!

MURDAH!
Johnny Valiant in this bitch!

[Verse 2: Rittz]
Whack rappers be thinking they doper then they are
I should have a deal, I supposed to been a star
I rather watch an episode of Khloé & Lamar
Than have to listen to you spit a bar this shit is garbage
Get a thesaurus or a rhyme addiction
Mad cause every verse I heard you laying is terrible
That bullshit will never get no play on my stereo
You don't want to challenge me cause if anything I'll embarrass you, bitch
Red do and I'm daring you I don't care if you buzzing online it doesn't make a difference to me, nah
Many trending MC's, before I let 'em beat me I will put a pistol to my head pull the trigger and squeeze
Before I buy a pair of skinnier jeans
A nightmare, I don't fight fair, can you put an end to your dreams
Keep sleeping on me and pretending I'm weak
I'm takin' over, guarantee that when you see me there gonna be a bloody-

[Hook] x2

[Verse 3: Rittz]
107.9 in Atlanta told em better play my record cause if not I'm bout to murder your staff
Guess I'm headed to the peoples station
Great strippers waiting, with his gun he told me put down the gat
I looked down and laughed and smashed I'm like fuck it I'm gone
My manager calling me pissed, "what the fuck have you done?"
I told him: "I been representing for Atlanta since the 90's showing love, so why the fuck nobody showing me none?"
I'm sick of holding my tongue, while so many come and go
And nobody try to put me in the spotlight yet
A ton of rappers like me been grinding for years trying to make a rep for this north-side shit
So before I quit I'm going to go on a killing spree
And murder anybody trying to say they ain't feeling me
Or any whack artist trying to say they as ill as me rappers biting wanna Milli Vanilli me bout to really be a-

I let her get it bust her melon open like Gallagher
Massacre, you're gonna be pissing through a catheter
I be ripping with the lip and about to flip
They're gonna laugh, at your rap, I'm a scavenger
Tech is a cold-blooded killer leaving you lavender
Quincy Jones, he told me that I be B-boppin', we rocking
Better than ever you're gonna see watch a G-Shocking
Peeper, how you gonna get with a creature
Murdering everywhere they be stamping my Visa

Shaking the fuck out of niggas and giving em seizures
Arriba, arriba, ain't nobody can see the

Call me a hooligan I'm not a human I'm a mutant in the rap game
Better be makin' room for me I'm movin' in
Been hated on so much I grew to be immune of it
Dope by makin' Methanfetamines from Sudafed
You da spit, they'd acknowledge it but they just be disputin' it
And they don't wanna see me up in the booth cause I'm a lunatic
I guess it's time to stick a pin in their balloon again
Bring 'em back to Earth, they'll say a word and then my mood'll flip
True to chew on any good{?}
Wack shit ain't made for me they need to put me in a looney bin
Doofuses, steady tryin' to bite and make a duplicate

[Hook][Verse 1]
I just got some drank, I just hit some herb
Took a couple shots, instantly I got the urge
I called my homie’s phone, he asked me where I am
I told him I’m at the crib, come thru and bring a couple grams
This ain’t every day, this ain’t once a week
But sometimes when I get drunk, all I wanna do is geek
So we started snorting lines, when it drained it tasted sweet
You could tell that shit was good, my mouth was crooked trying to speak
Chillin’ with my homie: me, him, and my girl
When we’re on that cocaine, it’s us against the world
Did 1 line, 2 line, 3 lines, 4 lines, 5 lines in a row
My hands are gettin’ clammy, it’s fuckin’ up my nose
But here I go, I’m on that…

[Hook]
Blow (blow), oh shit
I be on that blow, and I said I’m gon’ quit
I’m fucked up on that blow (blow), oh shit
And I really hope I don’t end up overdosing
Here we go again
I’m on that blow (blow), on that blo-o-ow
On that blow (blow), oh shit
I’m fucked up on that blow (blow), on that blo-o-ow
On that blow (blow), oh shit

[Verse 2]
This blow will make you talk, drinking while we chat
Talking bout our problems, yapping about the past
But that shit is a secret if anybody asks
Trying to come down with them Xanax, we’re popping Lortabs
Last time we was high, my girl done spilled her glass
The coke was on the table, that drink got in the bag
So we started freaking out cause that was all we had
We tried to microwave it, had to throw it in the trash
Seven in the morning, starting to  see the sun
Got one more line left, one a piece until it’s done
I pick up a CD case and spill that shit cause I was drunk
But instead of saying fuck it, tried to snort it off the rug
Cause we was fucked up on that…

[Hook]
Blow (blow), oh shit
I be on that blow, and I said I’m gon’ quit
I’m fucked up on that blow (blow), oh shit
And I really hope I don’t end up overdosin’
Here we go again
I’m on that blow (blow), on that blo-o-ow
On that blow (blow), oh shit
I’m fucked up on that blow (blow), on that blo-o-ow
On that blow (blow), oh shit

Here we go again[Hook]
I’m in my 87 cutlass supreme, looking clean
Smoking on that green while I lean
And the weed smoke is blowing my mind (my mind my mind)
And the swisher smoke is blowing my mind (my mind my mind)
You can find me riding 85 north for the A
Where the bitches fuck for riches and they see me getting paid
And the ladies they be blowing my mind (my mind my mind)
And these bitches they be blowing my mind (my mind my mind)
So now I’m

[Verse 1]
Shining like the North Star, see me out on Pleasant Hill
I may be out in Norcross, maybe up in Lawrenceville
Still really ain't no tellin' where the fuck you gonna see me
Maybe in Atlanta, see me partying on Beach Street
Looking Japanese cause I been smoking on that green green
Super clean clean, homie we be
Sniffing shit like porn stars, partying like animals
I drink then I pop more bars
At night I pop a couple Adderalls
All the bitches wanna get with this
I’m pimping and my day straight
Looking like she could have been a Playboy playmate
Fuck her to the rhythm of the 808 bass
Till you take pace, up in my

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Bumping DJ Burn One, looking like the white Dolemite
Got candy on the outside, but the leather in it’s cocaine white
My 15’s kicking down the street like it’s a stampede
Waving at some bitches that I seen up in the Grand Prix
Got to put some [?] on, I almost ran into a Camry
Goddamn she, looking fancy
Smelling like some pine trees, smoking with the windows up
The cops are right behind me, pull me over they gon' fine my buzz
So I hid it in my underwear, it’s reeking so much, this smell
Guess I’m paranoid cause I just seen em make a quick left
Accelerated on the pedal and I fishtailed
And I exhaled, up in my

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Showing off, gold flakes in the paint job
I’m rolling like a bowling ball
Strike, knock em down, when they see me cruising
All you hear is "oohs" and “aww”s and “wow”s
I make motherfuckers bite like crocodiles
Go ahead jock my style
It’s all good, it’s impossible to be me
Johnny Valiant, white bitch with me got titties like Foxy Brown
So when they see me at the red light, you cansee her head lights
I ain’t talking bout the European front four
Bout to take her home and beat the pussy up
Imma hit it like a gong or conga, bongo
I done had my fun with you but now I got to run, ho
Back up in the Cutlass, to roll it up
Smokin' lookin like a locomotive
Pullin' up at the local pub

[Hook][Verse 1: Rittz]
Superstar, man I'm far from an average Joe, supernatural
Stepping out, looking like I'm in a fashion show
Came into this industry and now you're witnessing me blow up
Like seeing a tank of gas explode
And I'm, I'm high like I'm flyin sitting back of coach
By the window sipping Jack and Cokes
'Bout to pack a bowl but we ain't tryna bake a casserole
Looking at the globe from up high, shots fired
Like Kennedy was riding by the Grassy Knoll
I ain't rich but I got a little cash to blow
When haters saying that I'm changing
I'll be looking at them laughing like they cracked a joke
They wasn't with me when I traveled down this gravel road
GC, I could never have my pass revoked
So step up and you a dead duck
Get your head bust, looking like a chef just cracked a yolk
Speakers in the Caddy rattling the patio
When the industry was only rocking platinum gold
I was dope back then, but you had the whole
Shit locked until I came and I cracked the code
And I don't, I don't really mean to brag and boast
But then again, my fans look at me as the G.O.A.T
She said she listen to my music in the bath and soak
Now that's a rap to quote, hop in my 'Lac and float
A Ya Uh Yeah

[Hook: Rittz]
Take a puff and it's up and away we go
Put some pimp shit on my radio and bounce, bounce, out
Let the bass vibrate my chest, take it to the Midwest
Brought it back to the south, and bounce, out

[Verse 2: Rittz]
With my homie Tony footwork
Up in Kalamazoo, balling out up in the mall
We don't bounce 'til we spend a couple thousand on shoes
I'm repping clintel, how can I lose, you out of the loop
These music dudes were clueless who I was
'Til I blew, producing woohs and oohs and ahs
I'm the truth, what you confused? Are you surprised?
I refuse to lose, been booed and crucified
Disapprove the movement, crews get brutalized
If  these pooches choose to bite, get euthanized
I'm the new, the who is who gets neutralized
Twenty two's are huge, my shoes are supersized
Out on cruse, my music boomin' stupid loud
Bumping 8 Ball & MJG, from the outside looking in
I'm sitting on top of the world, but then again I kind of been lately
When I pull up in my Cadillac, my speakers got that rattle back
I'm flashin' back to when I was attacked by
A couple pretty bitches that was begging me to pick em up
And take em in and fuck em from the back side
But I ain't got no time to fuck around, I'm trying to buckle down
And focus on my money, so I stack my
Paper to the ceiling, I'm feeling like a billion
I'm filling up my cup with that crown and bounce out

[Hook: Rittz]

[Verse 3: Twista]
Smoking wood, then I’m gone
So far that you can’t even see me through the eyes of a telescope
Diamonds on my body, so appealin  jottin' down my feelins'
Acting like it was the realest shit I ever wrote
Mental telepathy is part of the recipe
That let me know that you want it
I'm giving it to you how you like it
Biology of a pimp, it be in the DNA
To know what you thinking
I’m speaking to you like a psychic
Lil mama know she lovin it so don’t try to fight it
I can make your life so appealing by the way I write it
Make it so she the only shawty I know
On Forgiatos, don’t hit no potholes
I roll up one and light it
On the passenger side of a ride
Like a player, Imma be up in the club talking the  big shit
Strange Music, we be the misfits
Come and twist Rittz, tisk tisk, cause you gon get your shit split
Middle of the map and nigga finna snap
And let em know the area continue to kill em forever, we on
Better be strong to live in the city I come from
And if you ain’t fucking with it then let it be known
And we can either talk about it or be about it
Me I’d rather sit back and blow an ounce
When I hear something like this up on the radio
All a nigga can do is just bounce

Got doors on this bitch like a school bus
Hop on in motherfucker
Take you for a ride with a loaded ruger
So cold that I might need a coat rack
Look bitch you only need two puffs
That's crystal meth Catfish Billy smokin' tulips
All around the south I blow cash
That ain't leather that's nubuck
You ain't really ballin' ruthless
You ain't rollin' up on a new truck
I'm all about the Glock, fuck LoJack
I got this bitch on four's like two plus
Two and this bitch is lubed up
Treat MC's like a used slut
Yeah bitch I'm outtie
Five go tell yo' pap' that his boy's said howdy
You want to make it rain but would I, I doubt it
These hoes are bad weather, always cloudy
I'm a kill these bitches dig these ditches and
Rocks up out this chevy trunk before you dead and lost
Cause we peelin' off in that red Bugatti with bowties

[Hook]

(Oh, oh!) just me and that chevrolet (Bowties)

(Oh, oh!) you don't want to see that pistol wave (Bowties)
(Oh!) Me and that box running up clean and smooth (Bowties)

[Bridge: DJ Paul]
Turn the fuck up!
Rittz where you at?
Yelawolf, DJ Paul
Where the Chevy riders at?
Bring up, lets go!

[Verse 2: Rittz]
All black Chevy I'm a take it to the car show
Shouldn't drink and drive, I got some chrown inside my console
Blonde ho with me, 'bout to fuck, no time for convo'
Horny because I let her hit the chronic and the blanco
Long stroke, I'm known for swinging wood like I'm a golf pro
Hit it from the back she look behind and saw my charm glow
I took a picture of her pussy for a fact and finished
So she got the steppin' like she learned to do the mambo
Back inside my seat my speakers beatin' like a bongo
Bumpin' Box Chevy me and 'Wolf a perfect combo
Anyone want it with us can get it they beggin' for attention
Like Miley Cyrus when she twerk and let her tongue show, dumb though
Why you blaming us when you done gone broke
Rap's killing shit like Matt Dillon did in Gunsmoke
I'm just fired up while you gettin' dried up like an ancho
Chili but really still feelin' like I'm on my grind though
So I'm creepin' like a rhino, coming off the exit ramp
Northside Atlanta and I got it, want to get a gram
Servin' out my window like a worker on a Checker stand
Used to be a fan now they fucked it up and let me in
Leather interior until they get another print
Of my shoes, hit the runway inside my Chevy then
Hit the gas till the moon we will never land
Ain't nobody fuckin' with Slumerican put that on my Chevy

[Hook]

[Bridge: Yelawolf & DJ Paul]
Yeah ho
Dj Paul, Yelawolf
Motherfucker
Turn it motherfucking up
Bitch!

[Verse 3: Yelawolf]
Walk to the mall like fuck you
Give me that Mickey D Super Sized
Got a fresh pair of J's like two new crack heads
Shoelaces like Footloose, bounce on it
Coffee table full of shake and they breakin' up an ounce on it
Tweakers and the clique gettin' high as a brimstone
Thrown from the tip of the volcano, they sip on
Lean some of them lean on the wall and limp home
Steam mellowin' out of a Chevrolet Enzo
I put the house on it
Have a seat bitch put the couch on it
Take a sigh bitch I put the south on it
Take a ride in the 1989
You talkin' shit I might put the crowd on it
It would be another Yelawolf hate ground
Butter on the seats like country crop
But I fuckin' ain't no country crop
Puts fear in the heart of a country cop
Everytime that I get fuckin' stopped
Boy them some nice wheels but you better turn the music down
Cause it ain't the big city
Ran off the law with nothin' but a ticket
From a fuckin' hick with a stick and midget dealin' with midget and bowtie

[Verse 1: Rittz]
She was irate cause she got off work late for the second time this week
Racing home in a white Ford Escape
Had a nice quiet place by the lake up in Washington state
Her fiancee was paid but he had to take a trip out to Vegas and they ain't got no family
Or neighbors close by so she called him on the phone and let him know that she had made it home safe
Might have spoke too soon, as soon as she went inside her bedroom a man with a mask lashed out from inside of the closet
Put a knife up to her neck and said "Be quiet, try to scream and you'll be dead"
Ignoring what he said she screamed, it seemed to piss him off he shoved one of his gloves into her mouth
Tied her hands behind her back then he stabbed her in the abdomen and threw her on the bed
For 3 hours straight he tortured and raped her she tried to pray and fake like she was dead
She bled so much she knew that she was dying, closed her eyes
And when she opened them she noticed he was gone
Somehow she managed to make her wrists slide out of zip-ties
Used all of her strength crawling on the floor to lock the bedroom door
She made it to the nightstand and grabbed the phone and called 9-1-1

[PreHook 1]
*phone dialing*
"9-1-1 emergency"
"There's a man in my house, I've been stabbed!"
"ma'am calm down"
[Call 9-1-1]
"help me!"
"is he still in the house?"
"i don't know, i know he's here"
*Whimpering*
"Ma'am calm down. Is he still in the house Ma'am?"
*Scream*

[Hook][x2]
Call 9-1-1
You about to be a victim of a home invasion
Now your life is suddenly in jeopardy
You're praying someone rescue me
You about to die if you don't
Call 9-1-1


[Verse 2]
He was a single parent that had retired, him and his teen daughter live together
He never had problems with her as a kid
But she been misbehaving lately, that's a part of growing up
She was so in love with her new boyfriend - he was older
Her father told her he didn't want her seeing him
Cause she and him were skipping school just to sleep with him
And he could tell that they'd been doing drugs
Her father took her cell phone and car keys from her as punishment
Even threatened to send her to live with her momma
200 miles away but that would only make her hate him
Started plotting on her dad
One night when he sleeping he figured that he was dreaming cause he opened up his eyes
Saw his daughter staring at him from the bottom of his bed
And her boyfriend was standing right above him with a bat
Before he could react, or try to defend himself against her boyfriend, all you heard was whack
He hit him repeatedly, his daughter acted
Emotionless watching his blood splatter on the wall
Beat him to a bloody pulp for at least thirty minutes
There were fragments of his skull on the bed
Then her boyfriend left
Cracked the window, grabbed the telephone
She tried to play it off and called 9-1-1

[PreHook 2]
*Phone dialing*
"9-1-1 Emergency"
"Umm, somebody...somebody's hurt my dad, I need somebody here. Someone's hurt him"
[Call 9-1-1]
"Check to see if he has a pulse. Is he breathing?"
"Daddy?"
"Calm down, calm down"
"daddy...daddy... are you ok?
"We'll send somebody out there right now."
"Daddy are you ok? Breathe, dad."

Its taboo to rap about snortin shit
Buts its cool to write a song about green and e

How bout that time I snorted 3 whole bumps
You think im bad off on the soft
Give me some speed and we gon be awake for three whole months
Become paranoid talkin bout aliens and the government
Drawin on the walls fucked up then tryin to cover it
Gettin too deep with hoes you barely know
