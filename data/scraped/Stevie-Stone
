[Intro]
Uh-huh, rain dance
Choking on the loud

Episodes of Girls Gone Wild
Stevie Stone, Tecca Nina, Mystikal

Every time I come around then I make her rain dance

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Chock tall, native soil really does this
Rain dance for me, then give me a hug, bwitch
Because I throw hundreds they really want me to shove dwick
All up in 'em, they want that Nina to get in that love pit
Won't deny ya, cause lil mama sympathy
Tie ya right up, 50 shades of whoopin' this
Fire lighter, cause she want us two to get
Higher, higher (HEY) so we do this shit
That's what I do with the strippers
Paid a tip at 'em they coming home with us
We got the killer weed and we got liquor
The simple fact is we the niggas they did us
So it is normal they blowing my skin horn
And they know that they signing the sin form
When the come up in the house of [?]
Been a playa ever since I been born, bitch

[Pre-Hook + Hook]

[Verse 3: Mystikal]
Yikes, I know what she like
Pipe, I be laying it right she said it's
Tight, and she want it with Mike
I finna be bellin' in that pussy, like I'm ridin' a bike
After we leave the strip club my dick gon' be in her
She face down, rear end up
That's just how she'll end up
That what I came in this club for
That what I showin' her all this love for
That what I paid all them tips for
That what I left with this bitch for
She said "gimme some money, and I'll give you some head"
So I gave her some money, she gave me some head
Not that there's much else to be said
I fucked her so good, she came so hard, you woulda thought that she pissing the bed

[Pre-Hook + Hook][Intro]
Yup, uh-huh

[Verse 1]
Drink a whole lotta liquor
Smoke a whole lotta reefer
Paper planes in the wind
You can call me Khalifa
Watch me button up a Benz
You should grab you a feature
I'm a dog on the go
Bag a bitch from the bleachers
R-R-Run it, run it
Rather with a trio I know
I call these 3 RT3G bitches they ready to go
No you not on my level
You niggas don' came out here, bro
Step one foot in the game
Y'all niggas didn't get my M-O
Run that now

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Ain’t no run in the game well seasoned and polished
Gotta knock for these hoes
PSD with the science
I'm allergic to broke
I choose to use my Ebonics
I put my bitch on a boat
Look like she came from an island
We tryna find us a stripper
Magic CD in Onyx
Put my bread on the table
Give me something exotic
Body shots off her naval, that's a premium product
Holla
Run it, run it
B-bitch that mean that I got it

She said I'm steezy, erotic
I'm a Leo, pino

Get it all from her mother
See we come from the gutter, get 20, 50s and 100s
Bitch I'm a

[Hook][Verse 1: Godemis]
Pamet u glavu
Deevil!
Prayin' at 12:12 for hell, felon to sell
And slept on a bed of nails, like nothing I've ever felt
Ghost in a shell was molded with other demons
As if I needed some help or a host to preserve the heathen
Got it, my brain is rotted, I swear to God that I'm not it
I'm set to go to the gallow as soon as the rope is knotted
I ain't highest of high then the hydra have used adrenaline
Came in the cypher clean, still smelling like putrid cinnamon
Then I'm in, enemy of the state, I'm straight at an angle
Stop risking and quit your bitchin', it ain't like I'm raping a angel
Said I was magnifique, ya'll ain't fuckin' with it, capiche?
Not as safe as you would've thought with the devil under your feet
They throw a shot and then sit back and wait for some reaction
Ain't nothing to it but to do it, I'm a mummy rappin'
So get to clappin' or dissin' the clan you hatin'
Listen, the man is Jason and this is the Strangeulation

[Verse 2: Stevie Stone]
Stevie Stone, I'm on it, I'm so clever
Nobody comparing, I'm better, I put shit together
America's most elaborate rap, pick ya head up, huh
Small talkin'll get you wet up, huh, yeah
I'm ready to kill all you niggas
The feelin', adrenaline that'll spillin' a mill
And yeah, I mill' all you niggas
Ain't even reach out they climax, rather my celing on niggas
And backin' a back, I'll backhand Billy you niggas
Get busy on niggas, this ain't no random some leakage
Stonie in the building, the bitches pull out their cleavage
The snake and the bat, you see them prominent features
The species, Strangeland, we rain on your region, huh
Meat wagon, I come, I be taggin' 'em
Baggin' 'em, bring 'em clusters of three, got three magnums
Gaggin' em out, you pussies is still talkin'
I'm draggin' 'em out, I'm tappin' 'em out

[Verse 3: Murs]
Aww shit, they fucked around and signed a backpacker
Smart, rich, handsome, plus he's not a bad rapper
I'm just a little local talent that fucked around and made it big
Underground bully, pickin' on all these famous kids
And the danger is, now I'm doin' stranger biz
About to make the world forget about what a major is
Independent Powerhouse, running all these cowards out
My enemies are all forgotten, wishin' I would shout 'em out
And I don't want to hear a rapper harmonize unless
He thuggish, ruggish, Lazy, Krayzie, Bizzy, Wish or Flesh
But maybe I'm just hatin' cause my black ass could never sing
And fuck that autotune I hope the Futures filled with better things
And you a fucking liar if you say you found a better team
Impossible! Like trying to fit my dick inside my wedding ring
And all the bread it brings will be distributed and properly
I represent for hip hop not some fucking aristocracy

[Verse 4: Brotha Lynch Hung]
I'm the Martin Scorsese of rap, rap predator
Better than severin' the reverend with a jackknife
Kevin and eleven of 'em, revvin' up the engines
We bubblin' up like 7-Up, then when
We shoot that shit, we eat that shit for din-din, grrr
I don't need ya fuckin' okay, ah, are you serious? I'm okay
I'mma make you bleed like it's your period, period
I eat period pussy so eating you ain't serious
What, you need for me to flip that shit and rip that shit
Like a skitzo, stick that shit, that shit, like a automatic pistol grip?
No! I created this fast rap, I'm past that
I put a gat in that asscrack and blast that
I'm light years ahead of 'em, might use the head of 'em
I lose, then you can keep the breadcrumbs
Grrr, my nigga, I'm a carnivore
Ready for any kind of war, any kind of score[B.o.B]
Yeah, uh-huh, uh-oh, no, damn

[Tech N9ne]
It-it-it-it-it-it that good Colora-

[Hook: B.o.B]
-Do, do, do, do
You know it's that fire
I can't get no higher
Do, do, do, do
I came to turn the night up
Now watch me as I light up

[Tech N9ne]
Hey, I smoke in Amsterdam, in Denmark, Christiana
Canada, then Germany, now everybody in this twist ganja
Now when I go to my second home big Tech is prone to conjure
Some of that new legal purple good Colorado-marijuana

[Stevie Stone]
Break it down, pearl it up, fire it up, pass it ‘round
Got that dope, eighth and a dream and cuddle with a purp when I'm in a town
Nobody fucks with regular, all my shit spectacular
Hit it for the low shit gotta be real loud, and this wild next to ya
Rhino rolling in the most, hydro mixed with indigo
Blaze that shit, really can't get no high, but niggas still feel me though
Chokin' though, blazin' fire, roll 'em up, mile high
Lovin' Colorado strawberry kush open wide

[Tech N9ne]
Put you lighters up in the sky when the nigga do it
For the homeboy Pakelika, Restin' in Reefer
Smoking that Keisha through a vaporizer with a feature
Tech N9ne, I'mma kick it every time
When I ease my mind, I hit my bottle
But they legalized it in my second home
When I go I'mma hit that good Colora-do

[Hook]

[Godemis]
You already know what it is, tappin' bottles, chippin' lips
Rollin' up another thumper, then we on the way to kill another gig
Info, Frizz, Stevie, Tech, Ubi and P-caso too
Chongin' out in the open, tokin' smoke so loud that I can't hear you
Look at me walkin' sideways, wavy but I'm not sloppy
And I'm burnin' down the bush, with the chief the spirits have got me
Better roll up, you know I'm cold as fuck, going nuts iffin' I'm up in your place
Takin' a hit of the purp I'mma hold it in and blow it in your face!

[Info Gates]
{*Cough Cough*} Info Gates {*Cough*} bitch don't hate
I showed up at the studio bars official
Cause I'm on trees like carved initials
I got that Candy Maldonado but I'm in KC, not Colorado
So if a cop finds this avocado
I got in this medicine bottle I gotta get, gone

[Ubiquitous]
Be hittin' the indica strain when it get in my brain
That it isn't the same, I'm twistin the flame
Light up, the Ces is definitely beneficial for the pain
That medical Jane, never synthetic
You know photosynthesis gettin' the blame
Blowin' the legit if you switchin' the state
Uh, blow the puff and I'm driftin' away
When I'm out in the Springs with a mountain to king
I'm countin the ounces they bring, they offer that kush (Kush)
They burnin' the bush, they 'bout it no doubt it's a thing
I'm jackin' the cyph, then I'm coming for Colorado
Over half of my life
I came from Arvada back in the day
Got a habit for packin' the sack in the pipe
I blowin' that in-

[Hook]

[Bernz]
Been an outlaw for minute though, smokin' out with no shame
Blowin' loud out of my sun roof back in the Sunshine State
But then boys offered that cake so it's a cat and mouse type chase
So I growin' eyes on my back and droppin' brims over my face
I need a high estate, elevate, gotta get back up to that Denver stage
Where the fans are Strange and the air is thin
But the smoke is thick I just can't explain
Sparkin', puffin', passin', ease your pain and all these forms of fashion
I think it's only right we celebrate it, just get

[Wrekonize]
Up-up high, get 'em up-up high
Stuck in the sky, we gotta lust let's fly
And I just met my angel dangled
With a halo and a bud supply
Went over limit and you heard the tale
About my freaked out tweaked out weed dungeon
But I forget about that when I'm in the 'DO
See I be all up on them Green Funyuns
Took another trip out to the CO
Where they be telling me the liberty is legal
So that's no whiz test for your PO
We go to free load and debo Doritos
Showing love to Metropolis
And the brother with the funk on the side of the curb
Green cross in a season of moss
When they all breed crops and they dying to serve

[Rittz]
Fort Collins to Boulder we smoke the air
We just feel wicked we on that Jodi Arias
Rollin' and jokin' these folks just stare at us
Trippin' for no reason when it's so hilarious
You high or something, you stared but you scared to puff
You wanna fly with me yeah have fans with lust
Just be careful when you hit it, I got admit it
I been known for sprinkle these orange hairs with dust
Forgot where we was, tried to order a Quarter Pounder
From a Taco Bell drive through high so we drove off
On the road lost blinded from the smoke fog
Made it to the crib I hit the door and then I dozed off
Broke off my homies a couple buds
And ever since the day I did it I got a bunch of phone calls
Ask me how much do an O' cost
In Atlanta got 'em smokin' on that dope dog ya-ya-yeah

[Krizz Kaliko]
When I'm in another land I smoke that fire-iah-iah
I don't really hit to choke but tonight I'm gonna try-iah-iah
Take some weed, mix it with tobacco leafs
Actually and breathe in and lose my faculties, naturally
(Okay) Worldwide now, following Tech Nina
Take another hit if you got that reefer
Bring me a little bit of that sativa
Baby tokes is my anxiety, don't like when I put it inside of me
I go back to the bottle, when I take a hit of that Colora-do[Hook: Darrein Safron (Stevie Stone)]
Flashing lights
You can have whatever you like
Girl, I'll change your life
Fall in love with it, you can fall in love with it
She takin' it down to the floor, and she know I got more
I got more, it's just what she wants
(Yeah, bring it back now)
She working that pole
Girl, you know what you doin'
Keep movin' like that, they gon' fall in love
Ooh fall in love with it, you can fall in love with it
(Fall in love with it) X4

[Verse 1: Stevie Stone]
Baby got gifts
Badder than a mother fucker vibin' with them hips
When she get up to the pole, when she do her little tricks
Do a cartwheel, slide down, bounce to the splits
She walk up in the room and control it
She eyeing down the ones with money, come forward
Make a nigga fall in love with it, money you blow it
With the fifteen hundred 'fore a nigga even knew her
I love the way she move, look back at it
She got a nigga stuck and throwing racks at it
Lil' mama she's a thicky
Got a face like Cameron and an ass like Nicki

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Stevie Stone]
Ugh, bring it back now
Down 3 stacks, mommy gon' act out
Ass so big she could back Shaq down
And all them other bitches faded in the background
Yup, she a go-getter
And you will never ever see her with a broke nigga
In the club she bringin' over 4 wit' her
Body shots, keep 'em coming, bring mo' liquor
She told me fill the cup to the brim (to the brim)
She tokin' like she tryna stackin them
She do it like she workin' at a gym
Attitude like Rihanna, and a body like Kim

[Hook][Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
They said I really don't rhyme anymore
And dreaded the moment the N9na find any dough
Climb in these hoes, he never will shine when he flow
What are you listening to? The music I'm giving to you
Is killing the muthafuckas you kick it and jigglin' to
Some of you get it, but a lot of you never let it
Cause you know when it get up into your woman, I'mma wet it
I'mma wake up, everybody break up the haters
We do it for real and never do fakers, amaze us
Tecca Nina spending cake up in Vegas
Got the mule and 40 acres decades ago
Nigga, I'm a vet, made to grow, look at it
When we city to city, Tech pays the dough
Watching my lyrical bullet lay ya low
Next way to go and she with it so let's lay the flow
These bustas be so funny, they all shakin' when I rip
But in my face, they be so chummy, nigga, y'all, fakin' when I flip
When they know that my flow is money, y'all is bogus so go get from me
Man, I'm over this, how they grungy when they all take it in the hip?
War, I declare, till Donny air
And I want ¡MAYDAY!, Kaliko, Stevie Stone, Ubi and Godi there
I'm gonna push this hip-hop music to the fullest till I'll be mayor
They don't give a fuck if I swear, this the God damn remix to "Nobody Cares"

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko, (Crystal Watson) & (Tech N9ne)]
Everything in my head, all these words that I said
(Nobody cares) Nobody cares
(And nobody gives a damn what I say, who I am)
(Nobody cares) Nobody cares
These bright lights show my life (nobody cares)
(No one, no one, no one, no one cares, nobody, nobody)

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
Stare in the face of the careless pair
This facts, ain't nobody gotta say no more
I been breaking my back while you been crazy relaxed
A workaholic with a bit of crooked halo-lo
Paint so pro that I can't go prone
You better get a step and let the maintenance know
That I kick in doors and get to stickin' whores
All cause I'm loving every minute that I grace this show
Game beater, came sweeter
Every word they said to me is "damn", diva
Vein heater, flame speaker
¡MAYDAY! mace, they spray liters
Wavin' all out cause I'm tearing the crowd
They know I came to drop 'em down a whole lot of stairs
Rockin' so rare, I'm a topper, don't stare
Cause ya know we said before that nobody cares

[Verse 3: Godemis]
Catch this bullet, who's the receiver?
I never learn how to follow a leader
In need of a medical reticle bleeder
You don't give a flying fuck, well, me neither
Maybe I'm overthinking it, look at the way I'm linkin' it
With words, I'm a seamstress
Got plenty of fuel, I pity the fool
And tell 'em ridicule is the burden of genius
And I mean this, like I seen this
Coming but it don't mean shit to y'all
And my pedal's to the metal and whenever they ready
They said it, I'm coming to get it till I hit the wall
Stealing all, of the cake, trip
Placement of tables turn a bit, so who the fuck's turn is it?
Couldn't give two shits, see, I'm not concerned with it, my

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Bernz]
Is it that my shit's too catchy?
Is it that these hits come naturally?
Is it that we the chosen ones
And y'all never get picked so you act like a bitch?
Tell me why cause you're making me feel bad
Can we all get along? Don't be mad
Carry on, fuck it, bring the feedback
I feel so at home where the odds'll be stacked
Crash course into music business
Better trust yo' muthafuckin' instincts
Cause these suits are scared of what's different
Until it's banging on top of hit lists
And that's why the industry's fiction
And Strange Music's here to reign, bitches
We killed the whole opposition
All cause our fans are fuckin' hellicious

[Verse 5: Ubiquitous]
Sometimes, if you say the word, the word falls
On deaf ears or peers and they half-forget it
It feels like nobody'll care until you stare
Back apathetic, and that's pathetic
Matter fact, it's not in my rap genetics
Whatever the fuck you was after, get it
The law of magnetic attraction'll come and cause
Reaction, dog, you only have to let it, ah
Act upon my instinct when I set the bar
Let the cards fall where they may play
52, now pick it up, I, make the mess
Maybe yes, that's where they stay
No, fear to show, I'm clear to go
Anybody else who ever been here should know
That a voice with a passion and purpose
Is far from a theory, yo, but y'all don't hear me though, uh

[Hook]

[Bridge: Stevie Stone] (x2)
Eeeee! Hit 'em with the muthafuckin' rhythm
When they come with the N9ne, I'mma get 'em
Kaliko, ¡MAYDAY! Ces Cru, Strangeland
We mix all wit' em like

[Verse 6: Stevie Stone]
Muthafucka, in the meanwhile, hear the remix
We bound, what I mean now? Rush time!
Stage killer fuckin' with a main nigga
But the other Strange nigga, Brotha Lynch, gon' cut 'em up!
Come in a noose, ya (cover contusions), vertical movement
(The kid is a problem, better yet, he a nuisance)
All on my dick, nigga!

[Verse 7: Krizz Kaliko]
I'll get off my own dick, nigga, if you get off it
I'm sick, nigga, puke it off, and in my lane, refuse to walk it
Independent nigga who's the boss refuse to loss
And, if ya get offended, bust a move's an option
On the low (low), too many people is peepin'
We frequently eat up a piece of fajita, think he equal to me
I let him know (know) that he could be in the seat
And takin' off his feet about it and I'mma tweet about it
Reppin', me and the Tech, nigga, we effin'
When we done, they wish we never left it
And I'm guessin' you never had to pull out your weapon
I'm the next best, give 'em a lesson (okay)
The way we eat a nigga's lunch, Psilocybin combusts
Man, fuck it[Hook: Stevie Stone]
Bitch I'm out and rollin'
808 bendin' (Huh!)
Bend to my aroma
Strange on the linen (Uh-uh!)
Bitch I'm out and rollin'
808 bendin' (Yupp!)
Bend to my aroma (Huhh!)

Bitch I'm out and rollin' (Himmi!)
Strange on the linen

[Verse 1: Stevie Stone]
Ah, no, no, I say the projects says we on that Himmi Hyme
They got me on the deck, there's money on the line
Got 'em all reciting my rhymes, blowing on the Keisha
Channelin' my topics all around the region
(Region, region, region, region)
It's a wrap, wrap, wrap, got that shit that'll get 'em in the whips
And bring 'em back, back, back, said I'm ridin' mine
All up and down the county line you and niggas that strategize
Fuck you if I'm out out of line (Bitch I'm rollin', rollin)
Rap game, I tame, I get 'em nigga
(Go) Back down, not a ne'er nigga fuckin' with her
(Go) Runnin' miles on 'em, left 'til is a product wit' her
(Go) Got a model bitch, from another island, y'all
(Go) (I'm in the game!) Foot work pops
Mouth piece problems, Snake Bat diamonds
Off the meter, tryin' to stay honest
But compare me to the greatest bein' modest
Bitch I'm rollin'

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
My name is Aaron, I'm no fair an'
Your sister's starin', she's in love
Cause my 808's bendin', Benzo wheels spinnin'
Put a chick at the wheel and a lick to my grill
Man, I'm aimin' straight grinnin'
You smell Hugh Parsons, when I pass you bitch you barkin'
Like a dog when he see a true Martian who's sparkin' new jargon
Sorry and Scheisse, but your ladies really beautiful eyes'a
Looking at me like she wanna bigger size brahhh
Don't stifle her, let me slice her
Look at Nina go, F'in in the industry with a finger to the foe
When all my enemies, sentimentally they growin'
To women, when I spit 'em, cuz I'm a cold nigga roll
Ah, ha, ha, ha, me and my Strangers rolling
Drinkin' lots of Vodka, that's the ca-ca
You know I can't sang without a guitar strang
Rollin' around town, nigga', bumpin' Lil' Wayne
Everybody knowin' that we in the same gang
Gettin' good brain and I can't maintain
Great spending time with Stone, this Yate's ending
Now picture us rollin' with our 808's bendin'

[Hook] (2X)[Intro/Bridge: Krizz Kaliko]
Ok fellas this is it
We got together to play our kind of music and so far nobody's let us
Well we're going to play it tonight whether they like it or not
We're going to do all our good numbers tonight, every single one of them
We'll start with 1 O'Clock Jump

[Hook]
Ballin'
Talk is cheap, the bodies start to fall in
Rumors rappers are leanin on the wall again
Going all in, watch me put the pause in
What your man got, dawgs out there banging like Bangkok
Smoke clears we leaving off the main lot
Time's up, when the bass drop

[Verse 1: Stevie Stone]
You don’t hear me though
See your little bitter comments on the videos
Your peers and your ears bumping my material
See me, yo I’m the shit just in general, what [?]
They’d shoot me, I’m made you look
Never lying, landmine in my ramble
Crunch time on the grind got the line hooked
Fat dime think I’m lying got them all shook
You ain’t all that, 150 shows a year what you call that
Couple bad bitches groping on my ballsack
Fuck a fiend that could, pussy sipping cognac, haters fall back
1 O’Clock I’m getting the dope spot
The person with the pack raising the cap to smoke guap
Fiends is steady coming, the money it won’t stop

[Bridge]
We got together to play our kind of music and so far nobody's let us
Well we're going to play it tonight whether they like it or not
We're going to do all our good numbers tonight, every single one of them
We'll start with 1 O'Clock Jump

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
ATLien extraterrestrial
I'm in this bitch like I don't give a fuck, I've got an extra pair of testicles
I fuck your bitch then fall asleep on the couch with my draws and the tv on
That afternoon I killed you first, then cut up the corpse with Stevie Stone
Life in the jungle wasn't shit that my mama could teach
Should've used a coat hangar to kill me when I was a fetus
Go eat a Snickers cause you rappers just bitches and beavers
Fucking cupcakes, faggots with feminine features
I never trust women and reachers
I'm not a human being, I'm a different creature
I love ratchet bitches, belligerent skeezers
After I beat the pussy up then we getting some pizza
I'm pimpin' bitches with telekinesis
After your mom give me a blumpkin I'm nailing your nieces
Fuck your thoughts, to hell with your thesis
After we take the organs out then we mail them to Jesus

[Bridge]

[Hook]x2

We're going to do all our good numbers tonight, every single one of them

Ah, ha, ha, ha, me and my Strangers rolling
Drinkin' lots of Vodka, that's the ca-ca
You know I can't sang without a guitar strang
Rollin' around town, nigga', bumpin' Lil' Wayne

Great spending time with Stone, this Yate's ending

[Hook] (2X)[Intro: Krizz Kaliko]
She told me everytime I fall out with her

Violate your curves all night that’s my mission
And I know you get mad when you crave for my attention
When i’m home up off the road everyday thanksgiving
Type of women to show you ever day that she a rider
Any circumstances she my Bonnie i’m her Clyde
Ain’t no creeping on the side and the feelings can’t hide
Got some jealous tendencies but we let the shit slide
Overcame a lot of bullshit that we’ve been through
Lets you waltz down love drawn it continues
Knowing that you mine when you grind and i’m in you
This is how i feel (how i feel) when i’m near you…

{Hook }

{Verse 2}
Uh now its round two climb on top don’t stop shawty clown too
Got an angel that surrounds you
And you been a blessing since the first day I found you
And I’ve been waiting for a minute
A fine red bone creeped up got me stuck all in it
The homies said i’m winning
At late nights talking bout building
A fence first start at the begging
We got our stubborn ways opposites attract
She love my ambition how I travel through the map
I love her intuition and the way she threw it back
I ain’t even trying to brag i’m just laying out the facts……

{Bridge:Darrein}
Baby you're so beautiful
And I know, that I never felt like this before

-Do, do, do, do
You know it's that fire

Do, do, do, do
I came to turn the night up
Now watch me as I light up

[Tech N9ne]
Hey, I smoke in Amsterdam, in Denmark, Christiana
Canada, then Germany, now everybody in this twist ganja
Now when I go to my second home big Tech is prone to conjure
Some of that new legal purple good Colorado-marijuana

[Stevie Stone]
Break it down, pearl it up, fire it up, pass it ‘round
Got that dope, eighth and a dream and cuddle with a purp when I'm in a town
Nobody fucks with regular, all my shit spectacular
Hit it for the low shit gotta be real loud, and this wild next to ya
Rhino rolling in the most, hydro mixed with indigo
Blaze that shit, really can't get no high, but niggas still feel me though
Chokin' though, blazin' fire, roll 'em up, mile high
Lovin' Colorado strawberry kush open wide

[Tech N9ne]
Put you lighters up in the sky when the nigga do it
For the homeboy Pakelika, Restin' in Reefer
Smoking that Keisha through a vaporizer with a feature
Tech N9ne, I'mma kick it every time
When I ease my mind, I hit my bottle
But they legalized it in my second home
When I go I'mma hit that good Colora-do

[Hook]

[Godemis]
You already know what it is, tappin' bottles, chippin' lips
Rollin' up another thumper, then we on the way to kill another gig
Info, Frizz, Stevie, Tech, Ubi and P-caso too
Chongin' out in the open, tokin' smoke so loud that I can't hear you
Look at me walkin' sideways, wavy but I'm not sloppy
And I'm burnin' down the bush, with the chief the spirits have got me
Better roll up, you know I'm cold as fuck, going nuts iffin' I'm up in your place
Takin' a hit of the purp I'mma hold it in and blow it in your face!

[Info Gates]
{*Cough Cough*} Info Gates {*Cough*} bitch don't hate
I showed up at the studio bars official
Cause I'm on trees like carved initials
I got that Candy Maldonado but I'm in KC, not Colorado
So if a cop finds this avocado
I got in this medicine bottle I gotta get, gone

[Ubiquitous]
Be hittin' the indica strain when it get in my brain
That it isn't the same, I'm twistin the flame
Light up, the Ces is definitely beneficial for the pain
That medical Jane, never synthetic
You know photosynthesis gettin' the blame
Blowin' the legit if you switchin' the state
Uh, blow the puff and I'm driftin' away
When I'm out in the Springs with a mountain to king
I'm countin the ounces they bring, they offer that kush (Kush)
They burnin' the bush, they 'bout it no doubt it's a thing
I'm jackin' the cyph, then I'm coming for Colorado
Over half of my life
I came from Arvada back in the day
Got a habit for packin' the sack in the pipe
I blowin' that in-

[Hook]

[Bernz]
Been an outlaw for minute though, smokin' out with no shame
Blowin' loud out of my sun roof back in the Sunshine State
But then boys offered that cake so it's a cat and mouse type chase
So I growin' eyes on my back and droppin' brims over my face
I need a high estate, elevate, gotta get back up to that Denver stage
Where the fans are Strange and the air is thin
But the smoke is thick I just can't explain
Sparkin', puffin', passin', ease your pain and all these forms of fashion
I think it's only right we celebrate it, just get

[Wrekonize]
Up-up high, get 'em up-up high
Stuck in the sky, we gotta lust let's fly
And I just met my angel dangled
With a halo and a bud supply
Went over limit and you heard the tale
About my freaked out tweaked out weed dungeon
But I forget about that when I'm in the 'DO
See I be all up on them Green Funyuns
Took another trip out to the CO
Where they be telling me the liberty is legal
So that's no whiz test for your PO
We go to free load and debo Doritos
Showing love to Metropolis
And the brother with the funk on the side of the curb
Green cross in a season of moss
When they all breed crops and they dying to serve

[Rittz]
Fort Collins to Boulder we smoke the air
We just feel wicked we on that Jodi Arias
Rollin' and jokin' these folks just stare at us
Trippin' for no reason when it's so hilarious
You high or something, you stared but you scared to puff
You wanna fly with me yeah have fans with lust
Just be careful when you hit it, I got admit it
I been known for sprinkle these orange hairs with dust
Forgot where we was, tried to order a Quarter Pounder
From a Taco Bell drive through high so we drove off
On the road lost blinded from the smoke fog
Made it to the crib I hit the door and then I dozed off
Broke off my homies a couple buds
And ever since the day I did it I got a bunch of phone calls
Ask me how much do an O' cost
In Atlanta got 'em smokin' on that dope dog ya-ya-yeah

[Krizz Kaliko]
When I'm in another land I smoke that fire-iah-iah
I don't really hit to choke but tonight I'm gonna try-iah-iah
Take some weed, mix it with tobacco leafs
Actually and breathe in and lose my faculties, naturally
(Okay) Worldwide now, following Tech Nina
Take another hit if you got that reefer
Bring me a little bit of that sativa
Baby tokes is my anxiety, don't like when I put it inside of me
I go back to the bottle, when I take a hit of that Colora-do[Intro - Stevie Stone]
This here was all in a dream, everything's getting complicated
As it would have seemed, niggas was stressed out
The rent's due a couple of checks bounced
I was looking for something to test out
Criminal, I don't usually want the style but now
Circumstances have got me on prowl, I mean how
Up in the late night, you can check the shit out
And when I see the bait bite, voices were saying to me

[Hook - Yelawolf]
Let's go rob the dollar, general
Get the Benjamin's, and the penny rolls
Grab the panty hose, Like a criminal
Guess I'm a criminal
Let's go rob the dollar, general
Get the Benjamin's, and the penny rolls
Grab the panty hose, I'm a criminal
Guess I'm a criminal

[Verse 1 - Stevie Stone]
Here's the plan
Learned about this days ago from my man
Tonight is the night, strategizing and apprehend
We'll never get the chance to do this again
Know what I'm saying?
We be up in the alley round 3 o'clock
Off tops, cut the surveillance then we in the spot
Scan the cops so we can stand out
Know the room but not exactly where's whereabouts
Hope you're ready
Lay back and watch for the signal
Brought the proper tools so I can go through the window
Let me get in first, I see a way through the ceiling
It could be a west wing of the building
Boom, we in and we're fucking the shit here up
Looking through cabinets and cupboards and tearing shit up
I got it, let's go, hope that this dream is a hope
They got mafia ties, I think I've gotten too close
I'm living on the edge

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Stevie Stone]
This was a tight fit
Camping out, in this comfort, for the biggest heist yet
Hear the beat, the last gig, before retiring
In and out, the loot sirens
Go time is 3:43, the plan had to go in action when the cleaning lady leaves
And we, we was sitting quietly
Silently, wait til she leave it, do it probably
She gone, we making all way, over to the stairs
Straight up the control room with the cameras everywhere
Grab up all the tapes making them all disappear
The room with the safe there just sitting right here, yeah
This time I'm sawing up the wall
This safe is a beast, but I brought my biggest saw
A couple hours, the penetrated deep
Got home got home and counted 1107 G's
Criminalistic minded I be

[Hook][Intro 1: DJ Green Lantern]
Please be clear, this is an invasion
DJ Green Lantern, Mayday
It's a smash and grab
Strange Music situation
Smash and Grab, this is an invasion!

[Intro 2: Stevie Stone]
This here was all in a dream, everything's getting complicated
As it would have seemed, nigga was stressed out
The rent's due a couple of check bounce
I was looking for something to test out
Criminal, I don't usually want the style but now
Circumstances have got me on prowl, I mean how
Up in the late night, yo' go check the shit out
And when I see the bait bite, voices were saying to me

[Verse 1: Stevie Stone]
Here's the plan
Learned about this days ago from my man
Tonight is the night, strategizing and apprehend
We'll never get the chance to do this again
Know what I'm sayin'?
Meet me up in the alley round 3 o'clock
Of tops, cut the surveillance then we in the spot
Scan the cops so we can stand out

Hope you're ready
Lay back and watch for the signal
Brought the proper tools so I can go through the window

They havin' mafia ties, I think I've gotten too close
I'm living on the edge

[Hook: Yelawolf]

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
And all that knockin' on my doors
Been blockin' options, things are shockin' no more
Phone is ring ring ringin' again, I've been thinkin' that we better win
This is not my life choice, and it betta' end
All of the stress been leadin' up to me feelin' the need to get rich
And do it the fast way, that ski mask way's too passe
This clerks got on a vest and I know hes got kids to feed
But this is like the wild west, I've been drownin' in a ravine
And this genius seems to be fiendish bout' keeping me from the greenish
But I release the zenith, It's leepin' out in travenus
Empty drawers, say your prayers please
Your life is not requested, but hey we all payin' fees, unexpected
I seen it in a nightmare, the handcuffs and white stares
Walkin' up to sleep when their lights go out
You may be hungrier than one, but there's some
Who use a gun to hustle funds out of the weaker when they might have doubts
And they out

[Hook: Yelawolf]

[Verse 3: Bernz]
Welcome to the great depression, shoulda' gone to schoool for these lessons
Livin' like peasants while rubbin' shoulders with legends
Just uppin' to count my blessins', romanticising successes
Now the winters cold, its got me buried in the fuckin' snow
Diggin' my grave like a dog hidin' human bones
Like he writin' poems, keep rollin' stones
Hopin' all these songs crack the top of whatever chart they on
If not it's Bonnie and Mr.Clyde, Jekyll and Hyde
Homicide, all in one night, I'm never caught alive
Never ran, never go hide, cause ima' plan it right
You should steal, tight alibis, he'll never testify
See she been on it from the start, rebel heart
Fendi bag, gun in the car, these are the trappings of an underground star
Tryin' to keep the firebomb in his bar, but ya'll don't hear me thou'

[Hook: Yelawolf]

[Outro: DJ Green Lantern]
This is Smash and Grab![Intro]
Uh-huh
This what you been waiting for, okay
Hmmmm, yup
Uh-huh

Yep, said it's lunchtime
Got the beat and hopped up in the front line
Propped my feet, and may throw a couple punchlines
Actively, we droppin' this in no time, ugh
(EAT)
All heat, I bring no fillers
All meat, time to eat, the fam go wit' 'em
Pause me, run it back, this Rambo nigga
Taughty, I'm strapped with [?] get 'em
Spit flame, my shell don' drop rage and never been afraid of [?]
Blade will demonstrate a rare on [?]
Caged up, a renegade, I stays real hots, nigga
Eat the least [?]
Peep the technique, heat, the beat gon' knock
Street-for-street passing fleet of equinox
Foley don't find a key, nigga, to get that box
(HIMMI)
Talk breezy, is easy, the game need me
Pre-order for order, nigga, it need be
I'm instructed to give you niggas a freebie
You can call this assemble a little cheesy
Contrary to what another nigga said about it
Malta Bend catch wind, Imma aim at 'em
Reinforce, bigger course, I'm insane at it
Strange Music, nigga, get your brain scattered
Niggas been sleepin', I been peepin'
Carvin' you niggas out a classic, here's your safe keepin'
That misdirection got your head leakin'
I'm out here creepin' while you niggas sleepin'
Stick and I move, I'm feeding the faculty, eat
Janky promoters, they fuck you I'm raisin' the fee
Dead or alive the list of my five would be, it's:
Pac and Biggie
And Em
Then Nina
Then me
Little buddy been gettin' older, I gotten older, I'm colder, will leave you niggas a cold shoulder
Re-evaluate your composure, your moto is out of order, you want gas with that Rolls
CES pressure bust pipes, nigga turn it up
Niggas interviewin' 'plying they ain't earn enough
Stevie next up in line, watch me burn it up
Other niggas deincline, need to huddle up
Very few that could fuck wi' me (fuck wi' me)
Summer time mind, nigga stuck wi' me
It takes a certain type of breed to run the lead
Words'll be weaponry Imma buck, homie
3rd round, shut it down, this a warning shot
Give them skinny jeans niggas something to worry 'bout
Imma barge in, nigga, you can clear it out
Wanna fall in, nigga you get blurred out
Nigga I'm not done eatin', I'm speakin', they tweakin' the verbal beat and I'm here to learn niggas
Let it burn, let it burn (let it burn, let it burn)
I see you actin' all concerned, nigga
Turn the tube on, Nicki nominated grammy
Meek Mill, Nicki Mill, where they gettin' married?
Young nigga upcoming, bitch I been ready
Stevie Stone, Strange Music
Boy I fuck- ah-hah (eat)[Intro: Tech N9ne]
The sadness gets deeper, and now my body's growing weaker
To EMJ this is dedicated; through this, you'll never belated, bro

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
I told him, I ain't know you rap nigga, you cold blooded
The way he busted his flow on stage wasn't slow was it
My nigga was flippin', he grabbed the mic and was rippin'
Until some idiots was trippin' and then I heard bullets whistling
Then I sang 'em, I just want to celebrate, he laughed
Cause said he's "writing a song called Reno 911 straight on they ass"
Far as words go, it's crazy them were the last I heard
EMJ on this emotional musical journey

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Come ride with me, it's so sad to see, still ride with me
So join me, let me share with this world as I live out the dreams
We won't be gone for long, I promise you won't be alone
If you lose me, I'm writing the words of this song
My man Michael Jones, on this emotional musical journey

(Yo, this is OG Muggs, wanna shout out to my man EMJ
God took you away, it was too soon man
You're up there with the angles looking down
And watching our world right now brother
We love you, we miss you, we'll never forget you EMJ
Rest in peace brother)

[Verse 2: Irv Da Phenom]
That was my nigga
In the bunk right across from mine
Cracking them jokes like all the time
Hoppin' on stage with him every night
And why niggas
Would ever wanna take somebody's life
Who was living it like a shining light
Man all the homie ever did was smile
I still don't understand it, don't think I ever will
Why I couldn't have been the bitch nigga
That god had let get killed
Instead he took EMJ away, it's safe to say
I'll see your face again someday, at pearly gates
But I hold you in my heart until

[Verse 3: Kutt Calhoun]
At times I'm like
Yo EMJ, where you been?
I know you lookin' down on me like
"Here I am, Kutty!
And I ain't wanting for nothin' homie
No, mourning do nothin' for me
Your love is enough in store in its glory
Or what, so pour me a drink
We can cheer and toast, giving thanks to why
You didn't lose a partner, you gained a gangsta for life
In your heart I exist, but through music I'm able to live
I see the way you floss me all on your wrist
And that's what's up, man"

[Hook]

(On my highest day my nigga, you was there
Now I'm on my lowest day, cause you're not here
I miss you my nigga, love you EMJ)

[Verse 4: Bernz]
I seen a cruel bitch, met her in Reno Nevada
She'll have you living your dreams and take 'em all with no problem
In dark alley ways, where devils wait for the shootout
At someone who was special, I told my family about him
I saw his first tour, he told me Tech was his hero
And watched him from the crowd, to then go rock the same theaters
Step out of bounds and rounds can fly, behind casinos
On the night I never gambled and still lost it all in Reno

[Verse 5: Wrekonize]
If I only had 8 bars, to come and deliver to you in the graveyard
I'd say god is shitty for even releasing you behind the 8-ball
The pain's hard, I know you got kiddies to carry your name on
But I'm praying for 'em, so they don't end up just singing the same song
I'm hearing it in my sleep, I'm hearing it in the head
There's whispers on the beat, screaming EMJ where you been
I promise you everyone out here shed tears, until he remembers
High powered mayhem, EMJ, Mayday's 7th member

[Verse 6: Stevie Stone]
Remember like it was yesterday, show up in Reno
Off of the bus and to off a Bourbon then we hit the Casino
And then we, we did the show an we was only
It was all that crying and you and Rock was on that homie
Never should have left you lonely, you took six and survived it
Talked to you a couple days ago, still riding
No one never thought there was complications rising
A blood clot inside him, EMJ died I'm like

(EMJ, it's Cross-Eyed Joe man, we all fucking miss you bro)
(EMJ, what can I say man, rest in paradise
Rest in paradise pimpin, we love you)

[Verse 7: Jay Rock]
Michael Jones, I miss you my nigga
EMJ, still tryna cope with this
Still can't believe that you gone and I know I gots to be strong
Revenge is mine said the lord, so we gotta let him take control
But lord knows that I wanna grab the gat
Cock back and land a blow and watch heads roll
You was a talented man, I watched you gravitate fans
Shouted out where you been, people was all in a trance
Then we step on stage, you'd say "You killin 'em, Rock"
Then I'd say "You killin 'em, MJ," then you say "Let's put on for Watts"
You strong as an ox, in the bed just laying with shots
Laughing and jokin', meanwhile I'm going through emotions
Then you tell me Jay Rock, you gotta keep goin' on daddio
Your album about to drop, plus you can't be slacking bro
Yeah fo' sho' my nigga, I know this a minor set back
But you told me keep killin' 'em, you gon' be alright
I'mma be back, no time bet that, then I got that phone call
It was bad news at its best and it hurt me
That I lost my friend on this emotional musical journey

[Verse 8: Magnum PI]
Hold up roll up a Swisher, light up and paint a picture
Only if painted different, I would have been right there with you
So instead of cryin', I rejoice and pour out some liquor
Henny straight or mix it with lemonade, feel like I should be ashamed
I had to look you mama dead in the face
She told me everything was gon' be okay
You told me if anything you should be on your way home any day
Soon as we all relaxin' the phone rang, heard her sayin'
I'm goin' crazy, it's crazy, I'm thinkin' maybe just maybe
I'm misunderstandin' what your lady was sayin'
Naw-naw, you can't be serious, stop your talkin' delirious
Got my mom on the phone, you already know where his spirit went
So I drink that Hen 'til there no more left, right that wrong no it don't go left
Write this song try not stress, gotta be strong yet fight to death
As far as visions go that's that was last way that I saw
EMJ on this emotional musical journey

[Hook][Hook: Darrein Safron (Stevie Stone)]
Flashing lights
You can have whatever you like
Girl, I'll change your life
Fall in love with it, you can fall in love with it
She takin' it down to the floor, and she know I got more
I got more, it's just what she wants
(Yeah, bring it back now)
She working that pole
Girl, you know what you doin'
Keep movin' like that, they gon' fall in love
Ooh fall in love with it, you can fall in love with it
(Fall in love with it) X4

[Verse 1: Stevie Stone]
Baby got gifts
Badder than a mother fucker vibin' with them hips
When she get up to the pole, when she do her little tricks
Do a cartwheel, slide down, bounce to the splits
She walk up in the room and control it
She eyeing down the ones with money, come forward
Make a nigga fall in love with it, money you blow it
With the fifteen hundred 'fore a nigga even knew her
I love the way she move, look back at it
She got a nigga stuck and throwing racks at it
Lil' mama she's a thicky
Got a face like Cameron and an ass like Nicki

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Stevie Stone]
Ugh, bring it back now
Down 3 stacks, mommy gon' act out
Ass so big she could back Shaq down
And all them other bitches faded in the background
Yup, she a go-getter
And you will never ever see her with a broke nigga
In the club she bringin' over 4 wit' her
Body shots, keep 'em coming, bring mo' liquor
She told me fill the cup to the brim (to the brim)
She tokin' like she tryna stackin them
She do it like she workin' at a gym
Attitude like Rihanna, and a body like Kim

[Hook][Intro]
The following entry has... uh... seen mankind complete
Its first evolutionary steps into the universe
Leaving the planet Earth and going forward into the universe

[Hook: Stevie Stone & Tech N9ne] (2X)
I'm far out, off the chain
Took the star route, I done lost the plane
(I spit the bars out, with the quick of our mouth
Get to feeling the tip and let 'em take the dart out
With the superstar route, I can take it far out)

[Verse 1: J.L.]
Find me, I'm off in low Earth orbit
I'm far out, now I'm talking 'bout gotta get rid of
Your gravity to come towards it
I skyscrape, jump up in a cloud and absorb it
Rain down on you niggas like a storm hit
I'm headed for money and I'm sure of it, important
You know that I am dumb fresh, super fly, stupid high
About business like suit and tie
Trying to get paid like that YouTube guy
I'm one of them dudes, that get to running your dudes
You gotta give him his dues, I'm incredible
You never gonna fill in my shoes
The unforgettable truth is
I'm a beast when I get in this booth (Ah)
OK, OK, they know me, now don't they? I'm glad to say
Tech gave me the track and turned me loose like "JL, bomb away"
So you know I gotta do it like I'm spazzin'
I really get it crackin', never would've imagined, back when
I was on the block, I'd be rappin'
With one of the illest niggas ever to make it happen
I'm off to my zone, that's that fly zone
I don't give a damn about a hater, I'm gone
Eyes on the motherfuckin' prize and
I won't get disturbed and come down from my throne
B. Hood, full effect Strange, you digging it?
We living it up, man, it's all about the bigger shit
Ready for the benefit, hands in the air if you feeling it
Why would anybody wanna do it any different?

[Hook] (2X)

[Verse 2: P.R.E.A.C.H.]
I think I fit this track so perfect
Tecca Nina gave me a chance and I deserve it
I been putting in my work in, cutting it like a surgeon
Urging my people to rebel like an insurgent
I grab my sword and shield, jump in the field
To feel my enemy's pain, the look in his eyes, surprised
Realized denied by the stand up guy
You don't really want it with me, please don't try
(Wait a minute, aren't you that Romanian guy?)
Damn right, dirty, you can bet your life
And now it's time for me to make a sacrifice
So leave it like I see until my afterlife
If this is wrong, then I can't be right
They wanted me dead, but I stayed alive
Enemies who post like my favorite five
I'm dumping at 'em, then I wave bye bye
I'm off my noodle, ain't I?
And my secret ain't mine, gotta play fight
Ain't white, hate night in the daylight
You don't wanna be the one to catch that stain, right?
So please proceed with caution, and just don't speak too loud
Cause they go headhunting, in the Mississippi you found
They say I'm far out, I'm a giant in this large crowd
Get the fire with my heart out
I feel your hatred like the far south
See the truth is everybody wants the money
But they faking to make it if you pay attention
Look at the way I'm coming out the middle of the map
And attacking the track with the ways of a gremlin

[Hook] (2X)

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Sim-sim-salabim, that don't mean anything
But I can make it mean get a lot of green
And make everybody get up and sing with the Nin'
I'm a menace, they wanna put the Nina in Guinness
Cause I'm in the percentage of killers who finish
Any nigga without a limit, they get it cause I'm sinister
This ain't a gimmick when I rip and damage a mimicker
I be like a meteorite, I'm blazing everything
In my way so quick, you hear me humming
But the scientists gotta get multi-million
Dollar machinery for me just to see me coming
I'm far out, look at the people with the eye of an eagle
Tech, now look at the steeple
It's Tecca Nina and Beasel coming to defeat and
Diminish an evil, hit you with the strength of a Diesel
I – fifth street to Grain Valley, Spain to Cali
Can't hang if you ain't strange, nigga, bang bang, you in pain alley
Another dimension, you better repent
And you never ever let a nigga discover the tension
I gotta, sever the punk another was sent in to Allah
Given away today but the lynchin's tomorrow
Potato, on the end of a barrel, I pop it
And have a motherfucker living in peril
While I damage a devil, never doin' it for dinero
I'm taken out of his body like a nigga's on Cuervo
Tecca Nina gets colder with them
That'll mean everyone of they whores kissed him
On the tip of his big one
Dig it because I'm truly beyond the solar system

[Hook] (2X)[Hook: Wrekonize]
Livin' my life under a blacklight
Out here paying my dues
Sometimes I lose it and don't act right
Feelin' forever new
Livin' my life under a blacklight
Out here paying my dues
Sometimes I lose it and don't act right
Feelin' forever new
Feelin' forever new

[Bridge: Bernz]
Another night, another song
Another message, another wrong
Another chain too hard to break, I carry on
The weekday war is hard, but I love gettin' down til there's blood in my palms

[Verse 1: Wrekonize]
Faith in the wrong, acein' them all
Traveling down to get the better set or stake in them all
I'mma live fast, steady breakin' the laws
Tell em to get a grip and let me chase the applause
Nightlight on the tight like the dynamite, got 'em like
"Man, these some all time lifers."
We hype bout it the mic right
But what can we say to help us to burn brighter
Go pro so, so long
Pick it up until the dark, like sonar
Pen 'em and still I'm on the meal to the bogarts
So far we broke off the sonar, they so lost
And I'm here for my birth right, counseling
One too many in the back of my mind
Think too much about my life then I found it
To make me want to jump back in the line
This one is just another nightlife song
Come on home and turn the nightlights on
Waitin' for the sun to rise and I'm not nine to five lies all died in the mornin'
Fives up for the restart, sunset, countdown, (clock ready or get ready), go
Forever new, we can't reload

[Hook]

[Bridge: Bernz]
Sometimes I feel like this in my blood, you know?
Some of my earliest memories is
Wakin' up once a week
And hearin' the party goin' on downstairs

[Verse 2: Bernz]
Black lights, white lines, high times, red eyes
Clean whips, dirty minds, bad girls, new designs
Tough city, tougher life
Callin' death, soul on ice
Chest burnin' but it feel nice
Sneakin' not to seek out the night
And I'm sorry ma
Cause the downtown lights are never off
Hypnotized by the evening demons
Feel the neon lights are turned on
Hear the DJ rotate my song
Never thought set would break a dawn
Feelin' like modern day out-laws
Getting paid well for singing our songs
Praise the Lord, thank the stars
In tape we trust, rush the music cards
Watch us work hard and earn that rent
Tryin' to make that boy blow his whole paycheck
And I feel at home with the freaks and wierdos
In the club surrounded by people
Some are scared to say that we're evil
But it's cool

[Hook]

[Bridge: Stevie Stone]
These are the days of the road (traveling at night)
Spread my wings as I ease through the door (I reside under this blacklight)

[Verse 3: Stevie Stone]
Wake up, whole new city, gotta shake up
Time takes up
Bout ten shows to get the kinks out
We bake out then we drink up
We go hard to get cake up
Caution sign, this tape up
Down around about an hour to drive
I got a limited time I get it dranked up
When I'm fucked up I don't act right
Temptation, I just might
Hard to fight when she is the type to be actin' out at those black lights
But I'm leaving now, ready tomorrow, twice a year and I'm comin' back
Sinister Avenue, lovin' the party
Keepin' it low with no strings attached
(I'm livin') Livin' every day like my last
(I'm livin') All work, no play, no rest
(I'm givin') Givin' every little bit a part of me
(I'm givin') Last time for me to go and last breath
(Yeah) Forever my journey, message suggests
100 dog on top lets rep YEP

[Outro]
Livin my life under a blacklight[Verse 1:Stevie Stone]
Better brace yourself for the second coming
Gotta clear that, it's the baggage now I'm off and running
Did you hear that,can you feel that?
The static cos' I finally done it
Spread a little bit of magic
On them chocolate bunnie (buns), I get it in!
Bitch Stone don't pay no more
Don't never not get paid no more
Say what you really wanna say
You niggas wanna hate but you really can't hate no more
Don't never knock on stage no more
Strange Music dipped in butter
Different faces colored
Could of been alot of others
Repping M-I crooked letter crooked letter
O-U-R-I got my sht together (shit together)
Struttin' with my fit together, clip together
Got my crib together, yeah I got my sh*t together

[Hook:Stevie Stone]
(get buck!)
Step on scene and they need me
And they know if you open trynna see me,just because I
(Get Buck!)
Callin it a blast from the past
And tonight im bout to get up in that ass
You gonna watch me
(get buck!)
Know you on the sideline hatin'
And your formula’s fitted to fakin' little buddy (get buck)
Head like a Rorschak, shakin'
And you got the nerve to question what I’m thinkin'
I'm about to
(get buck!)

[Verse 2:Stevie Stone]
Hear the product?
Well it sound good don't it?
Talk more shit, I’ll make you get our weight an rep your hood on it
Stepped out,hoped out the back seat
Hot step, stay back,feed it to tha bat
Hold the turf,reppin lately
Been in my zone here,lately
? break another wall hear lately
I'mma get up in that ass
In the middle with a map
Of the MO and I'm way to ?
Cravin bitches is crazy
Motherfuckers got crazy
Nigass wanna get up in the feelings
I'm surrounded by their ladies
Whatchya sayin,whatchya sayin
(what you sayin boy)
Haters think we play,think we playin
(playin,huh?)
Kawasaki crotchrocket
Got that burner in my pocket
In case you niggas try to stop it

[Hook][Hook]
IF you ain’t got no money (YUP)
You ain’t got no money (YUP)
If you ain’t got no money get the hell out of my face(x4)
And if you got the money
Spend it (spend it) (x5)
Let your whole crew do it baby… AHA
Spend it (spend it)(x4)
Spend, Spend it

[Verse 1:Stevie Stone]
I get that waist, I give I take
I'mma get a little dough, I'mma spend that cake
Put it all on the plate, got a little bit of room, got the appetizer man
Waken up by the lake (by the lake)
Waken up by the lake. I wake and bake (I bake)
Put the cookie on my face (my face)
Put the cookie in my face, let me get a little taste
She bad seductive and she teasin, she make me spend my money (my money)
My offering appeasin'. I make the money rain on her and picking up the pace and
(IF YOU AIN’T GOT NO MONEY GET THE HELL OUF OF MY FACE)
HIMMI!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
KALI BABY
I make it rain on them, only if they got the same name on them
Snake and a bat, you ain’t got ask he got his chain on him
Don't claim no game even tho' got his flame on him, shame on them
Excited, invited so we came on them (KALI BABY)
Suited and booted ready for baby to toot it if she
Cute then I ruin her, the money’s why they pursuing them
I don’t save' em but give 'em a little taste
And if you ain’t got no money then get the hell out of my face

[Hook]

[Bridge: Krizz Kaliko]
Now can I get a handclap (a hand clap) for money the getters
Let me get a handclap(a hand clap) for the broke niggas
(OKAY)

[Verse 3: Stevie Stone]
Two or three kids baby mama kneel
Soccer mom in a Benz what she ridin' in
Said she need a baby daddy that can follow them
Ne'mind I give her kids but she’ll have to swallow them
Got kids of my own, but they livin' at home
Got a couple lil whips, and they sittin' on chrome
Lil mama picked up in the right place…
How about (IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE MONEY GET THE HELL OUT OF MY FACE)

[Hook]

[Outro: Krizz Kaliko]
KALI BABY![Verse 1]
Shining like four gorillas
[?] sinners, Stone going in, attend me rhythm now
[?] protégé, prospect of a cold nine milla, check the internet
They say I’m wyling, wyling
Madlibs, get to growling, growling
Said I grinded it the whole damn way, got him at wayne
No bitch you can’t deny him
I’m heated, I’m oscillated
Of liquor, imitated and weeded
I came in the game with a freight train demeanor
Showing all the lames that my plane the least
Google it and read it
Them clutch free throws
I hear it or something, got me you niggas green dough
You cross the line, I catch you riding between those
This Stevie Stone, don’t fuck with me or my team though
Tell em what I’m on niggas

[Hook]
Started this way back
See the momentum was my motherfucking name mat
Bitch I want payback
I learned a 100 different ways that I could gain that, getting that
Getting ugly, getting ugly, ugly
Getting ugly, getting ugly, hey
Stevie don’t play that
I got brains and business tryna get that payback
Getting it

[Verse 2]
Sit alone in a dark room
I grab the mic and I talk to it
You can see the spark
And me manipulating words, all these words
Gotta convert em, pause
Let the beat talk
Start gripping the flame and it’s got gifted
[?] looked at my dream, and it’s all scripted
Chains lifted, I’m running round and I’m drifting
In every town, get addicted, and I’m forward bound, get lifted
They waited, I figured that you would be happy one of these niggas made it
Instead you be sucking on Jellysickles, frustrated
You find [?] with Ruthless, I’m reincarnated
Stars on the rating
Ha, you see I been a vet
Travel around the world rapping, I been a threat
Ah, you never benefit
I’m so compounded but nigga better check my intellect
Tell em what I’m on niggas

[Hook][x2]Uh-Huh

I am not a rapper, I'm a grave digga [x12]

[Verse 1]
Monsta
My verbals be control
I'll tease you then taunt ya (Ya)
Putting them right down in the ganja (Ya)
It's bloody murder, I'm a grave digga (grave digga)
I got my shovel time to grave niggas (grave niggas)
Sitting in a bar, hunger tickin' I'm takin' the ball
Standing in the dark (standing in the dark, dark) aim for the heart
Messing bodies apart
Ligaments and ya tendons my verbals be tearing them apart
I'll leave them underneath the [?]
I'm taking them to the cemetery, got some bodies need to be buried, set my mark
I got my shovel digging the gravel, I don't rap
Somebody tell these niggas

[Break]
Whoa, y'all hear that?
You got to pull over, yo
I'm a grave digga



[Verse 2]
Look, I'm not a rapper
Most of you niggas actors
Just miseries of this world, and you're absolutly not a factor
You better? You's a motherfucking lie
I'm seasoned and groomed, better not (not)
We killing them, got caskets and Pall-bearers just [?]
This diss got a nigga straight pissed
Push pulling, pulling out the hit list
We humming I'm a get him while we gunning
I'm gunning when I'm through that mist (you silly really)
I'm a show you how to get (illy really)
Talk a whole lotta shit (plot to kill me)
Propane when I rip (in the building)
I'm a leave em dead in the hip hop
Time to blow these candles out
You need to bring that camera out
Walked in, last bout
Found my victim, point him out
Strung 'em in, drugged him out

[Hook](Intro)

Hate, is a form of evil, a waste of an emotion
All my life ive been against the odds
So thou dont offend me, yea they intensely fuelin my fire
The rhythym and ryhmes that I quote, one of the realest that I ever wrote
(huh) and I will not stop
You gonna feel it, im a let it go, Im the realest that they ever wrote
(huh) and I will not stop

(Verse 1 )

Since the time that Stoney been spittin
Hes gifted with game, versitile, so the people listen
Not to mention the fame that it brang cause Stoney glisten
Hes causin friction
Theres moral to the story, everybody gotta pay attention
Im on a mission
Got my eyes up on the prize
Always gon keep it hunnit never catch me falsify
See others tryin mine, see they hatin in they eye
See Stoney on the rise, see gotta respect his grind
Stevie on the road, Stevie doin hella shows
Hangin with the big name, they say he bound to blow
Always on the boy yea they talk behind my back
And when I come to town, gossip get to commin back
I tell em "what, im back," but your talkin is nothin
Tell em stack up they paper, Ain't no future in frontin
On the buck and im bendin
Yes my flow is authentic
You witnessin the future, Im a fuckin lieutenant

(Chorus)

You can hate but you wastin your time
You can hate but you wastin your time
(man your wastin your time)
I know a lot of folk fake and they lie
You can hate but you wastin your time
(homie you wastin your time)
And theres a couple that'll hate on me
If it's up to them they'd turn the page on me
(man your wastin your time)
But you forgot that im a brave homie
Until they put me in the grave homie
(huh, your wastin your time)

(Verse 2)

This one here has kept you some feelins
Im speakin of circumstances, reminiscing the chillin
Some niggas is wishes that im floppin from the beginnin
Makes me a villain
What type of manager can't manage his own spendin
What type of homie gets salty when I ride to the ceilin
Camouflagin his feelin
Its an envious syndrome
Always makin somebody mad in this life that im livin
Is this how im perceived
All this hatins a givin
Im survivin the struggle
I can figure to fix ya
Haters fuel to my fire
Ive ignited the picture
Theres more stalkas who rip ya
Got a beautiful buzz
Analyzin the situation when im off in them nubs
Dont get it twisted when im ventin ya, its not a diss
Its a situation im facin yall when im copin wit
My pen and my pad for play I recorded it
Im a subordinate and haters im gettin bored of it

(chorus)

(outro)

Hatin x12[Stevie Stone]
Yeah Bitch, people wanna see me
DV go get that boy that poise that voice up on the TV
Stevie gon' bring that swing, that shit that bang that very easy
Watch how I get that grain I'mma get that grain, your body leaning
Body leanin', heard he try to mock me
Dirty swagger Jack in the middle of a glimpse, a carbon-copy
You's a jocky, shit be drunk and sloppy
Why would he take them numbers? me, my bitch we sippin' sake
Japanese and Teriyaki, like- Stevie won't do no mumbles
Stevie won't do no mommas get a little whiff of this new gun, um
Yeah I know you see me come up
Suckers 'round here dunno
Twenty-thousand packs your ass fast nigga order me to

[Hook]
(Hush) one sight'll make you duck
'round here, put your final batter up
Now watch me make 'em
(Hush) yeah we ran into before
Yeah I see 'em mean muggin' on the low
And indeed he had to
(Hush) got my dogs out and we rockin'
When we come through who blockin'
What you mad now cause I'm poppin', nigga?
(Hush) all that he-said, she-said
That's that shit that we don't play
I'm ready to make moves, I'm doin' it my way
You niggas'd better (Hush)

[Kutt Kalhoun]
Hush, like a nigga ain't worth a mil ticket
Black Gold? Not poppin'? Pussy, I'll make a deal wit'cha
Put your album up against my album
And it's song for song, we quote line for line
I got more charisma I'm more consistent
If you deny it, then you livin' lies like 'ey ('ey)
Hey (hey), just look what a nigga done been through
No radio play, no worldwide stream and I got way more than I'm into
Cause my destiny is ??more gain, mane??, won't sell my soul so I'm fit to
Be a bigger name, reign for this Strange Game, and use fame as one of my utensils
Hope you follow my innuendos, since you got me all in your Vinto
If it's problems I don't pretend to not to solve 'em, I get up in you
Just killed 2 Birds with 1 Stone
Nigga, it ain't no rush
If it's beef you want then I got it
But if not you veggie niggas need to

[Hook]

[Brotha Lynch Hung]
Yeah bitch I'mma hit that weed and I'mma go psycho on 'em
I'mma put 'em in the knapsack, Michael on 'em
That nigga better back-back, I don't want 'em
I'll put 'em in the Cadillac, that's that
(gr) I'mma rip that cat
He better get out of my way it's that sack-
-king and I'mma bring us that ?black?
(gr) Heard he try to hit me
I can't believe it like Ripley's
I got a death date in my dickey's
I'mma get hefty, lefty, I'mma get messy let's see
Wanna test me? Impers' and hearse 'em
And it won't be no verse I'm certain 'em
I'mma be lurkin' her like when he come in the curtain
I'mma be high as a kite, cocaine
Runnin' all up in they house with AK's
I'mma just keep the heat, as they say
I'mma just bring the heat to their place
(gr) Fuckin' 'em and I bit 'em
Cuttin' 'em and I bleed 'em when I cut 'em all up in the cleavage
He gon'
