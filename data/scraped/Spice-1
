[Intro]
Haha, the remix - 5 on it!
We creepin' in too, baby
We got 5 on ery'thang mane!
We got Dru Down; we got the Luniz! Shock G, wassup?
Numskull and Yukmouth! Richie Rich, E-40, Spice 1

[Verse 1 - Dru Down]
You say you got 5 on my tender, you can bend her over the table
But be sure that you bring my stallion back to my stable
Say, brah? No elementary school-ground playing
Not a 5-dollar bill, but 5-double-zero on the real, feel?
I'm on the level, staying mellow
No criticism from the fellows, hello
Being keyed during a high-speed but still don't tap the B.B.'s
I'm D.D., Dru Down, baby

[Numskull]
Like Nyquil, I drop fevers; so either put your 5 up
Or you gots to "Leave It" like "Beaver"
Cause see, a nigga perkin' broke'll smoke your spliff all day
Go home and buy big drinky with his briddy then parlay
I got 5 on the Hennessey, Seagram's, or 40's
Cause "This is How We Do It" like Montell Jordan
I'm from the Oakland City, Frank Nitti is a goner
Num' blowing it up like Oklahoma

[Richie Rich]
Put your feev' with my fin, best believe we'll bend
More corners than you thought till something right is bought
More z-sacks? Believe that: tokin!
Where you from? Oakland! Smokin'
In attempts to crack the chest plate
The zips be so fluffy the whole town loves me
At every event I'm sacked up
So if you need me, scream "Double R!" when you see me

[Hook - Michael Marshall]
I got five on it ("got it good!")
Grab your 4, let's get keyed
I got 5 on it
Messing with that indo weed!
I got 5 on it; it's got me stuck, cannot go back
I got 5 on it: partna let's go half on a sack!

[Verse 2 - E-40]
"E-40, why you treat me so bad?" 40 makes it happen
Fosgate slappin' and revenue grows
From just a little bit of lightweight flamboastin'
Potent fumes, lingering mighty clouds and Northern Lights
You disrespect Vic da Baron
And you'll be violating my civil rights
I'm starting to feel my scrilla
But perhaps today my scrilla ain't feeling me
For the simple fact that I'm off to the track with hella fools, B
Pockets empty, pitching 5, man I'm dusted
Took off my hat, passed it around, man sprinkle me

[Yukmouth]
Me and E-40 to the head, comin' fed plus, you let the lead bust
Ready to do a murda, mayn; perved off the Hurricane
Slurred again, witness what bein' off two-fifths equal
Me killin' people like Jason, facin' death every sequel
(Insane in the membrane!) "Bring the Pain" like Method
Neglected, smokin kryptonite to the brain for breakfast
Guzzle the Hen-do, finsta do the evil that men do
Give me feev', I shall proceed to continue

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Shock G]
Yeah, it's been a while since I've hollered from the town
Mess around and heard Yuk' and Num', said I gotta be down
Cause new styles is going down: look around you
Tunes from the Lunz spreading round and round you

[Shock G as Humpty Hump]
Back to get my O on, they let me flow on
The thirty-five on it, yeah, I'm on it
Still bringing satin for them drawers
Velvet for the mic and got a pound for the cause

[Spice 1]
Rolling up cannabis sativa, hitting the Mary Jane
Smoking the 5 before it's 12 o'clock, sipping on Hurricane
Ready to smoke on the indoe; rolling up my window, finna to go to the land
With a handful of broccoli
When it comes to the sticky I'm the man
Crush nasty, I be hitting the J so hard I hurl
Fall on the floor fittin' to have a stroke
T-H-C ain't no joke
I got 5 on ery'thing, let's get loaded and smoke
S-P-I-C-E about to hit it and croak

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeah, wassup baby?
It's me, your boy with the cape that's always tight
You a little short on some ends?
Don't worry, I'll take care of that, I got 5 on that
I got you[Havoc the Mouthpiece]
Yo Russell Simmons

And keepin a motherfuckin slug up in the chamber
+I Don't Give a Fuck+ like 2Pac

Squeeze yo motherfuckin neck and snatch your head off your shoulders
Peel ya cap read your brain like the devil boy I told ya
Make a move for your gat and I'mma split your fuckin back
6 ways with a mack Havoc's in a mood to put a dick in the dirt

You couldn't deal with the real shit so you got ass whipped
Fuckin with a lunatic bitch West Coast on a wreck
So motherfuck the mainstream you tuned in to the gangsta team

[Prodeje]

Droppin it in the back the fuckin niggas with a damn pole
And that nigga Prod he's a gangsta I know the game bro
And I could be a fuckin murderer the hot shells melt yo ass G
And the Tales From the Crypt grabs yo ass like a movie
You got fucked up nigga when you fucked up
The brain splat on the floor like some damn nuts

[2Pac]

1-80-7 thousand G..G..G..G..G.......[Spice 1]
Coolin' on the corner with the cellular phone
You could tell that the East Bay was his home
More mail than the rest of the pushers
Cause he got a TEC-9 in the bushes
And that's how his shit was handled
First name Jack, last name Daniels
Had two boys named E and J
E had the nine and J the AK
Clocked on a street called Hennessy
Rivals with a motherfucker named Ol' E
E had a bitch and her name was Gin
Had a nigga named Juice doin' time in the pen
You couldn't tell that Gin was a bitch though
Cause she was fuckin' some nigga named Cisco
E and J knew tonight they'd come
With two fat niggas named Bacardi and Rum
They capped Jack's ho and the sight was scary
The bitch was all bloody and her name was Mary
Officer Martini wiped up the body
And all fingers pointed at Rum and Bacardi
E and J told Jack the whole tale
So Jack tried to bail Juice out the jail
But Ol' E had the judge on a payroll clout
So Jack shot the judge up and broke Juice out
Now everybody's talkin' 'bout Gin and Juice
Juice shot Gin cause the bitch was loose
Now E is shook thinkin' they ain't gonna get me
I'll round up the posse and call up Mickey
Mickey was big, he only sold eight balls
Had 99 niggas up against the wall
E and J found out he made the call
So E and J and Jack and Juice nined them all
They were sent to the morgue and Mickey paid the bill
Got the money from the bitch workin' Strawberry Hill
Jack and Juice said Mickey wouldn't survive
But Mickey was slick he had a Colt 45
And now he's wonderin' how he got the word
It was the neighborhood wino Thunderbird
You wonder how the murder rap got so much juice
It was 187 proof
Check it out!

[Spice 1]
Mickey sent St. Ides after Thunderbird
Time for the hurricane, E said word
Thunderbird in an alley way wearin' a beanie
Tryin' to get a sip from the cop Mr. Martini
St. Ides screwed off Thunderbird's top
Spilled his drink and gave a swig to the cop
But it's too late Martini knows it all
Mickey and his boy Ol' E were slingin' eight balls
Of cocaine to the strawberries on the hill
So when he asked for Juice he got a quick fill
Mickey had his boy on Bourbon block
The murderous cop killer Mr. Peppermint Schnapps
Mickey had this thing about nosy cops
And it made Mr. Peppermint lose his top
Martini off duty waitin' for the night train
Didn't know his wife Champagne would ever see him again
Peppermint Schnapps creepin' with the Colt 45
Gotta peel his cap 'fore the train arrives
Gotta stay Lowenbrau here comes the train
"All aboard!" said the engineers Bartles and Jaymes
There was a toot from the train and then a gun blast
Martini fell on the ground there was a big splash
Mr. Schnapps got up because the cops chased him
St. Ides and Mickey in a 'vette ready in front of the station
But you know Jack and Juice was undercover
And Jack was mad because Mickey shot his lover
There was big shootout and Mickey got juiced
He couldn't hang with the 187 proof
Juice is splattered and St. Ides had took a fall
And then Endo smoked 'em all
Check it out![E-40](Richie Rich)
I'm really not all that sure
Bout when things is finna mature
So let me find me a nigga with a grip
And hit his ass quick with one of them licks
(What's the definition of a lick?)
Taking a niggas shit
(Hey put that on sumthin)
I put that on The Click, The Click
Back to fuckin work one of the homies jus got dusted
Time to do some dirt, uhh, I never trusted
Them bustas shot him in the shirt, dead on arrival
Now the town is funking, it's called survival
What y'all wanna do? They got us skunked
(Well if uhh, we can just uhh) if it was a fifth we'll all be drunk
I'm heated, them niggas cheated, played me false
We had a meetin, shit 'posed to been squashed
I noticed one killa on the double dribble and set him up y'all
She likes the Monie in the Middle, play tetherball
Thick ass bitch, high yellow city-slicker
Scarecrow creepin Southern bitches, aka Posie Pussyfictious

[Spice 1]
Nigga been holdin guts, but shit on hisself and a funky bill
Pullin out bills, frontin on material shit
That's when I get to killin shit (killin shit)
And settin 'im up and havin 'im catchin a couple of slugs
Sl-uh sl-uh slugs, trynta fuck with savage thug
Pistol pop in they ass, see niggas be gettin this twisted
It's that bitch that killed ya
Took all your money peeled ya
Seven niggas bust in the room with AK's
While a nigga be puttin on his jimmy
All of a sudden they shoot up your Vuitton
Before you can hit the broccoli
See money-a-made that nigga, that nigga didn't make that money
Left them niggas jacked up, and the bitch she macked him
He's a busta, punk ass nigga, y'all know the streets
That's why that nigga naked layin dead in between some bloody sheets
It's just a part of the game he didn't feel
Bitches will kill, fuck a nigga, out his last d-uh dollar bill
You don't know that ho main that bitch can't be trusted
Dusted and di-motherfuckin-sgusted

[Hook: E-40]
Some cold hearted shit
Back to fuckin work, one of the homies jus got dusted
Whacha'll wanna do, whacha'll wanna do
Cold hearted bitches
Back to fuckin work, one of the homies jus got dusted
Whacha'll wanna do, I never trusted them bustas
Some cold hearted shit
Back to fuckin work, one of the homies jus got dusted
I never trusted them bustas
And it's them cold hearted nigga
Back to fuckin work, one of the homies jus got dusted
Dusted and disgusted

[E-40]
Let's let of some two or threes on the other side of t-uh-town
Draw the attention on the other s-uh-side of town (other side of town)
And wait for the po-po shift to change, ghetto shootin range
Revenge on the r-uh-rebound, war games
Droughts, ouch, lost clientele but I will prevail
By sellin the broccoli dank instead of the crack cocaine
Try not to steal narcotics
When these punk MC's and bitches be the reason why
The smoke be comin up out the chop, with my nigga 'Pac

[2Pac]
Dear God, can you forgive me? My future's lookin sick
I'm in my rag hittin switches I'm suspicious of these bitches
I keep on, calllin, but ain't nobody pickin up
I think she's stallin, this evil bitch is tryin ta set me up
Came all alone if it's on then it's on
Where's my motherfuckin chrome, only jealous niggas roam
It's a war zone (war zone) but I'm a man so with gun in hand
I'm on my way to see this ho you know the fuckin plan
Can't understand, but the things ain't the same
You could die over these bitches if you slippin in the game
Niggas gang bang, but bitches gang bang too
Give up that good thang, and put that pistol to your brain
If you a smart figure, don't have no love in your heart nigga
Any complications pull the trigger, dusted and disgusted
Bitches can't be trusted, you know the rules
They underhanded, she planned it, you fuckin fool

[Interlude]
(These hoes out here tryin to hold a nigga's heart
So a nigga get his money fucked with
Almost in-laws)
Hey be proud of it when you turn these bitches upside down
What's gonna happen
(Uhh, three and a half dollars or probably fo' if
A bitch ridin)
(Yeah main, them hoes talented
They be fuckin with mo' MC's than Jack the Rapper)
(Aight fuck it, what you say Mall?
Ay, fuck them sheisty ass bootches, nigga)

[Mac Mall]
The California lifestyle that I live
Where the bitches is crooked and niggas jus don't give
A flyin fuck, so I stay stuck, smokin on the tay-low
Bay Area playa, tryin ta have shit major
And a bitch won't save ya
So I ain't playin Captain Save-a-Ho
I mob up in ya like a pro and then I'm gone
I'm like Sylvester Stallone, everyday is like a Cliffhanger
Action packed, I let the mini-mac smack that ass

[Spice 1]
Them hoes jacked that ass
Nigga woulda got smokin on that hash
Can't have my cash, better go and take your nigga stash
Cuz he's a busta, niggas with clusters
Slippin in shit, betta jack that nigga 'fore I jack his ass bitch
Never was no love for the mark-ass, the lo pink (the lo pink)
You love them Bootsy bitches, can't let them pussy bitches

[E-40]
Gank that ass, betta hide your cash and check her fast
Pump your brakes nigga, slow your roll don't go too fast
Cause bulletproof ain't doin no good no mo' no mo' no mo' no mo'
Now, niggas comin up dead with they brains blew out on the fuckin floor
Damn, hollow points to flesh tears through the teflon vest
Now r-uh-rest
Pull a plug on a flatline over those, one nigga less
One nigga less, from coast to coast, to the East to the West
Crushin the flesh, dem bitches played a game of death
Look over your shoulder watch your back don't even trust it
I'm tryin to told ya end up dusted

Chorus[Hook]√ó4
Rollin with my muthafuckin' strap on the side of me
Don't fuck with the East Bay Gs

[Verse 1]
Buck 'em down with the clip and the trigga
Screamin' like Eiht, yelling "Come on nigga"
Nappy-head muthafuckas in a Coupe de Ville
Lightin' shit up like Fire Marshal Bill
You see, I hops on the flow like my nigga Domino
And get a big fat sack of yay-ay
A key or a half, a motherfuckin' thang, pistol-whipped him with an AK-ay
Peep this, loddi-doddi, I shot up his body
I left his ass bloody in the front of the party
It's a yig-a-young nigga rollin' up out the cut
Do a drive-by with the feds on my nuts
Niggas be gettin' gatted when they step to this G
See, I pull my muthafuckin' UZI
And, spill his brain (spill his brain)
Spill his brain (spill his brain)
Spill his brain in his muthafuckin' lap
I pulls a jack (pulls a jack) Pulls a jack (pulls a jack)
And shoot the heart out his muthafuckin' back
I'm comin' with the 187, not with that ho shit
So niggas, spark up the bomb, so we can blow shit

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Comin' up in a mask like Tales from the Crypt
UZ thang swallows that ass like Lipton, nigga
And now, they're trying to wander and figure
How the fuck Charles Manson turned himself to a nigga
Put a blast on their ass with the holes of the barrel
Bullets fly in a chest like a muthafuckin' sparrow
Cause we get like Steven King, bodies swing from my ceiling
Oak was in the chest when it's time for cap peelin'
9-4, hit the do with a fat gat
Comin' like this, break em down like that
The nigga with the bags and the fat crack sack
Po-Poes on my back, blow their ass off the map
With the 187, mad man killa
Spill a nigga guts for the fuck, cause, I'll be...

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
It goes one for the treble, you don't wanna floss
Unless you wanna flex with my bitch you Nina Ross
Ga-a-gat that ass with the double-deuce Derringer
From the bay area, the pall-burier
Six niggas carry ya, momma in hysteria
Welcome to your muthafuckin' coffin, they'll stare at ya
Cause, you're a dead muthafucka black
And you never should have fucked with the 187 Fac
So nick-nack paddywhack, give a G a gat
And put some bullets in that ass crack
Yeah, break em down with the mac
And like John Madden '93, "Boom, he's on his back"
Spice 1 is a muthafuckin' troopa
So, say what's up to the East Bay Freddy Krueger
Blow the head off the muthafuckin' cow
When my gat goes off like an M1000
Take the hood off your hooptie when I bust a cap
Rollin with my muthafuckin' strap on my side

[Hook]Straight out the motherfucking bay
Here we go

[2Pac]
Lord help me, save me, Mama keep praying
For a young motherfucker trying to duck an early grave
In the city where ya can't tell the snakes from the fakes
Fakes from the phonies, enemies of homies
Around the corner there's another nigga waiting to jack
He don't know I got a Glock 'til his ass get shot
Like a motherfucking thug disease
Craving beats like they motherfucking drugs to me, hey
What's up with bitches trying to screw me? Do me cause I did a movie
Throw the pussy to me but before they never knew me
Rather die then let ya play me for a, buster
And with my Glock I'm a plotting ass rotten motherfucker, huh
Don't let the movie fool ya, let me school ya
Screaming Thug Life nigga when I do ya
I'm going crazy, getting dizzy
And then I suffacate a motherfucking breather bring me back
I'm telling ya I'm losing it

[Hook]
Said I'm losing my mind
Losing my mind
[ X4 ]

[Big Syke]
I'm going crazy, niggas can't fade me
On the real I kill when I step to ya fucking grill
So let me kick it let me flip it let me get wicked
I'm not a buster from the hood selling wolf tickets
I hang with G's flipping keys and smoking weed
I get the cash and dash and never learn to read
So fuck a bitch fuck a ho and I let ya know
Because they come and go like the wind blows
What am I giving how I'm living what I'm giving up
You can take my life and I don't give a fuck
Cause I'm the trouble most coming from the west coast
Where the niggas is banging 'til the overdose
Killers and murderers, psychos and lunatics
Nobody knows what makes my mind click
Is it the demons, screaming inside of me?
Hell no it's just the Thug Life mentallity
I'm going crazy shit don't phase me
I'm living like a thug 'til six niggas carry me
Death is on the trigga so pull it
I can't take it no more, nigga, I'm losing it

[Hook]

[Spice 1]
Shit was talking to me, my gat screamed fire
The bullet told me shoot that motherfucker he's a liar
I talked to me 3-80 like a bitch on a stroll
When my niggas try to ????
Nigga, I can't get fucked in this game I'm a psychopath
My AK told me to shove him up some niggas ass
I'm having long conversations with Mr. Millimeter
He's one of my best friends bitch ass nigga eater
And Miss Mossburg love it in the back trunk
You know that old school bitch she like to get it funked
And spitting motherfuckers by the seems
My grand daddy Mr. AR-15
By the evil motherfucker
Talked me into taking over a dope turf and shooting cluckers
Said he was my only family
Shoot straight, and please don't jam me
Got in a fight at the club my gat started talking
Told me to shut the fuck up and let him do the talking
I woke up and it was sick to see the guts hang
I'm going nuts man
Shit was talking to me

[Hook] to fadeWelcome to the ghetto

(Verse 1)
Livin day by day in my hood on the spot
See the same old things:same dope
Fiends cops
Just an average day in the streets of California
5-0 find a young girl dead around the corner
Mommies on her knees she had tears in her eyes
And nobody knew why the young girl had to die
People look ashamed it's been like this fo years
Bloody sheets on her body face wet from her mama's tears
She couldn'ta been over 4-5
And if mommy wasn't based she would still be alive
But now the street is a place you could be swallowed by death
Brothas takin each other's lives
And goin to REST IN PEACE
I wonder if heaven got a ghetto
My cousin died last year
And I still can't let go
I walk the streets of my city of my neighborhood
Seein dope fiends livin off can goods
15 niggas on the corner
And niggas die young in California
5-0 'll get a dope case and flaunt it
Have your ass on "America's Most Wanted"
But I don't slang or even gang-bang
And though my old school homies do the same thang
I still got love cause you gotta live
So you can give
And raise a family G
But you gotta do your best slangin D-O-P-E
So keep a grip on yourself and stay mellow
And welcome to the ghetto
(Make me Wanna Holler, they way they do my life)

(chorus) 4x
Welcome to the ghetto
(Make me Wanna Holler, they way they do my life)

(Verse 2)
From across the seas comes cocaine
But you never seen a black man fly the plane
Look at the news:a young black death
Was it drug related,take a guess
I flash when I look in the mirror black
Cause my reflection is a 9 millimeter Gat
I think about genocide
And have thoughts of my homies who died
Everybody backstabbin
But I ain't the one to talk I'm into gafflin
Death
Gives a shit about your color
But yet I see mo dead young brothas
I'm goin crazy out here
Seein 24 brothas die by the end of the year
And I still gotta deal with the 5-0
And I stopped sellin dope in 9-0
But if I came to it
I probably still do it
Put a Nine in my draws get straight to it
I hope that I never see the day
That I get 20 years for a cake
B-K-A as a key
So open up the door for the
Mo money
But I ain't gotta do that G
Cause I'm down with the F-A to the C to the U to the L-T-Y
G-nut X-tra Large
And S-P-I-C-E make niggas feel like jello
And welcome to the ghetto
(Make me Wanna Holler, they way they do my life)

(chorus) 4x

Welcome to the ghetto 7x

(Verse 3)
Ain't no justice its just us
And any nigga with the guts loves to bust
At the police niggas can't get peace
Sendin' troops to the ghetto like the middle east
My homie on the block got beat down
And he never sold an ouce, a key, a pound
Suicide was a notion, sometimes I wanna run and dive in the ocean
But killin' myself ain't the answer cause the problems of the world need a cure like cancer
And everybody see the problem but the president and he ain't livin' in the ghetto so that's evident
I quit pullin' over, fuck the police
Cause they beat Rodney King like a savage beast
Now motherfuckers on my block think its Glock time
Open up season on cop time
So welcome to the ghetto
Where niggas try to play yo ass like a cello
The mayor got the projects boarded up
And the white and the blacks all sorted up
My people livin' in poverty
And everytime i wanna' max I'm on a motherfuckers property
Make me wanna' get the gat to and peel a cap to i gives a fuck about the tattoo
Tears, spendin' years in the P-E-N
Cop dead gone with the wind
Fuck love in the ghetto see
187 THOUSAND G![ VERSE 1 ]
I'm tryin to keep my aces and my deuces all together
I'm thinkin of self-murder I know I won't live forever
This chronic got me noid I need to get a job
But instead I wanna sell dope hang on a rope and steady mobb
I'm wakin up in the morning thinkin of death as I break out in a cold sweat
I'm havin dreams of a whole family put to rest
Visions of a dead man body bags
And all the youngsters gettin their cap peeled over coloured rags
I write about murder and death cause thats all in the hood
Comin up strong while in crack yo G its all good
Describin a way of life that they don't understand G
So I'mma keep breakin it down until dey understand me
You see its real G and jealousy it roam my block
Thats why I'm never leavin the house without my plastic Glock
Cause if they want it they'll take it and kill for it
And if its worth sumptin then blood gettin spilled for it
My mother thinks I'm goin crazy
And when I leave the house she just stares out the window
I think I'm being followed everytime I leave my home
Havin these fatal thoughts of gettin chrome to my dome

[ Hook ]
18--187 me say the murder the murder he wrote
18--187 me say the murder the murder he wrote--- blooooow

[ VERSE 2 ]
Did things up in the past that I regret at 22
And when I hit 23 I hope I'm livin well as you
Its good to be alive in 93 I guess that so
But if I gotta go I gotta go I gotta go
I guess I'm just a soldier with a song out of the streets black
Stressin of that chronic sack but I feel death is knockin at my bed
Sleep walkin with my pistol in the middle of the night
Wakin up inside my hooptie holdin my Glock full of fright
Violent in this art thats only because its comin from a G to the heart
Got friends that have died and I mourn for their families
Bringin flowers to dey graves everytime I get a chance G
Nuthin like a old school homie from the hood
Which are right or wrong doin dirt doin good
And now I know inside I'll never see my boy again
I fie myself always pour brew out fo my friends

CHORUS

[ VERSE 3 ]
I'm keepin all my pictures from my homies up in jail
If I told you what dey did it will problably turn your pale
I used to hang wit killers and I didn't even know
Wrestlin wit my homies as a youngster age 4
Now half of dem is dead and the rest is in the jailhouse
Writin to me monthly givin they homies sumtin to rap about
Tell me do my music and don't trip off what dey say
Thinkin to myself I might just be in there one day
Some stayed about the big house and still slangin yay
And now dey stayin under diction of feds everyday
Tryin to wash their money they wanna go on tour G
Gettin into the business learn about the industry
Try to help em out doin everythang I can
I still gotta worry bout the next jealous man
My homies gettin robbed so they rob somebody else
You can see it never stops let that story tell itself
I'm walkin wit my head down pervin in the rain
Thinkin deep askin myself am I insane
I think about that daily and I'm leavin on that note
And thats the definition of the 187 that he wrote

CHORUS[Spice 1]
Coolin' on the corner with the cellular phone
You could tell that the East Bay was his home
More mail than the rest of the pushers
Cause he got a TEC-9 in the bushes
And that's how his shit was handled
First name Jack, last name Daniels
Had two boys named E and J
E had the nine and J the AK
Clocked on a street called Hennessy
Rivals with a motherfucker named Ol' E
E had a bitch and her name was Gin
Had a nigga named Juice doin' time in the pen
You couldn't tell that Gin was a bitch though
Cause she was fuckin' some nigga named Cisco
E and J knew tonight they'd come
With two fat niggas named Bacardi and Rum
They capped Jack's ho and the sight was scary
The bitch was all bloody and her name was Mary
Officer Martini wiped up the body
And all fingers pointed at Rum and Bacardi
E and J told Jack the whole tale
So Jack tried to bail Juice out the jail
But Ol' E had the judge on a payroll clout
So Jack shot the judge up and broke Juice out
Now everybody's talkin' 'bout Gin and Juice
Juice shot Gin cause the bitch was loose
Now E is shook thinkin' they ain't gonna get me
I'll round up the posse and call up Mickey
Mickey was big, he only sold eight balls
Had 99 niggas up against the wall
E and J found out he made the call
So E and J and Jack and Juice nined them all
They were sent to the morgue and Mickey paid the bill
Got the money from the bitch workin' Strawberry Hill
Jack and Juice said Mickey wouldn't survive
But Mickey was slick he had a Colt 45
And now he's wonderin' how he got the word
It was the neighborhood wino Thunderbird
You wonder how the murder rap got so much juice
It was 187 proof
Check it out!

[Spice 1]
Mickey sent St. Ides after Thunderbird
Time for the hurricane, E said word
Thunderbird in an alley way wearin' a beanie
Tryin' to get a sip from the cop Mr. Martini
St. Ides screwed off Thunderbird's top
Spilled his drink and gave a swig to the cop
But it's too late Martini knows it all
Mickey and his boy Ol' E were slingin' eight balls
Of cocaine to the strawberries on the hill
So when he asked for Juice he got a quick fill
Mickey had his boy on Bourbon block
The murderous cop killer Mr. Peppermint Schnapps
Mickey had this thing about nosy cops
And it made Mr. Peppermint lose his top
Martini off duty waitin' for the night train
Didn't know his wife Champagne would ever see him again
Peppermint Schnapps creepin' with the Colt 45
Gotta peel his cap 'fore the train arrives
Gotta stay Lowenbrau here comes the train
"All aboard!" said the engineers Bartles and Jaymes
There was a toot from the train and then a gun blast
Martini fell on the ground there was a big splash
Mr. Schnapps got up because the cops chased him
St. Ides and Mickey in a 'vette ready in front of the station
But you know Jack and Juice was undercover
And Jack was mad because Mickey shot his lover
There was big shootout and Mickey got juiced
He couldn't hang with the 187 proof
Juice is splattered and St. Ides had took a fall
And then Endo smoked 'em all

Coke and Endo two big macks
Coke had a grenade, told Endo catch
Doin' it just for fun best frinds don't gank
You catch 'em kickin' it at the park a lot fuckin' wit Dank
Dank was real just a hardcore nigga
Shot his bitch up cause she drank all the liquor
Seen him at the park drinkin' 40's last week
Did a drive-by on some niggas in a Jeep
He shot up Heroin and P.C.P
Some niggas from a clique called L.S.D
These niggas wasn't playin' they got straight to the point
Shot up his mothers house col' smoked the joint
All he left was two brothers by the last name Doobie
Two midget ass gangsters both strapped both nuttey
One had the nine and the other had the 4-5
When they did a ht it took 'em both to drive
Didn't use nuttin' fast like a Vette or a Jag
Did a drive-by in the mutha fuckin' drop top Zig-Zag
Coke and his sister Mary Jane
On Marijuana block drinkin' 40's to the brain
And wadn't trippin' off the gunshots
Cause on Marijuana block no one calls the cops

Cause it's 187 PURE- check it out

Endo smoked 'em all

Sessame street, where Coke pimped ho's with a glass pipe
And got paid green at midnight
Wadn't no more Hennessey
So the cops had ta roll up Sess. for me
Officer Taylor with the high beams
Talkin' that gang shit strapped wit a dope screen
Ran up on Coke and Jane
Fucked up Coke and beat him down with his own cane
Said you better quite fuckin' with Dank
Cause if you don't I'll turn your ass to crank
And smashed off on a speedball
Cause he just got the Doobie brothers drive-by call
Dank hit the corner something caught his eye
That sexy ass black bitch Chocolate Tye
She was thick and rich, bitch couldn't be cuter
Had nice brown eyes and a big round budda
Took her to the 'tel didn't pull no stunts
Told the bitch he was fuckin', the nigga was quite blunt
The mutha fuckin' murder rap got ya keyed for sure
Cause it was 187 PURE- check it out

I murda like this (this) I murda like that (that)
Pull an AK-47 up out my motherfuckin gangsta hat
Professional Columbian Necktie, barbwire
Strangler, over killa, dead fuckin body hanga
Peepin out the window with an A.K., pullin up on these copper
Helicoptas, squad cars, swat teams with choppers
They tellin me, "Nigga, get the fuck out before ya die
If you surrender, we'll make sure that you quickly fry"
Should I kick open the door and go to war
Or should I slit my throat
Leave a pipe bomb and a fuck you note
Hallucinations of seein lynched bodies burnin
And all the po-po had faces like Mark Fuhrman
Tear gas through my glass window pane
They wanna put me back up in the nut house again
But I'm not goin back and take my prozac
They can keep the straight jacket
And leave a straight motherfuckin jack
A straight motherfuckin jack
A straight motherfuckin jack

Motherfuckers still sufferin and healin
Some high tech knowledga white boys blew up the fuckin fed buildin
Crazy niggas still bangin and slangin crack
To the death, when the game put em up on they back
Motherfuckers catchin AIDS, from shootin hop
And phony niggas still get sprayed up on the block
And I ain't changed much, hell
I'm still smokin four or five motherfuckin choppers before it's twelve
Motherfuckers think they know me, but they don't know
I'm sellin first class tickets to the murda show
Don't wanna rap about no nigga, let's get it on
Bustin domes, buck shots through your rib bone
So all you niggas up in the magazines talkin shit
Get off my dick, I'm 1990-sick

Muthafucka step outside you know what I'm sayin
Then get my muthafuckin Chronic sack, know what I'm sayin
Turn around, motherfucker sheriff
Motherfucker got his hand in my goddamn back pocket and shit
Handcuffed a nigga
Threw him on the backseat, search a nigga car
Find his goddamn strap, now I'm up in this motherfucker
Straight caught up, Fuck it though, you know

Soon as a nigga steps up in the county
I see killaz goin to the row
It was a riot kickin off early up in the dorm next door
I'm up in the 9500 where the shankin is on
If you up in the LA county, nigga you feelin me strong
It's a million penitentary one OG said
Secerity Guard fast tapped a shank up under our bed
And bust them headz with a flashlight at 3 in the morning
Waken your ass up with a BLEW, nigga put you blues on
And get the fuck up out the bunk we gonna go for a walk
Police got a code of silence, see none of them talk
About the shit that be goin on up in the County Jail
5 guards handcuffed a nigga beat him to death in his cell
See 3 days is like a month, 3 months is like a year
Cause you can get your throat slit from ear to ear
I wish somebody would help me out in the situation I'm in
But there ain't no luv up in the County
Cause your foe's got to be your friend...

If the guard want to come and find mine
2 hands and a Razor blade
Then the officer gonna have to get my
2 hands off the razor blade
When I wake up in the morning and see it again
Then someones gonna have to end up D.D.Dead
And if your Friend got soaked then he a D.D.Dead

Yeah you know what I'm sayin a dead motherfucker
Barely up in there, they try to slide around all over the place
Like a little bitch or something
They try to get him to calm down, but anyway it goes like this
They tell a nigga strip down to naked and shit
In the shower with thirty motherfuckers
But there's only ten in the shower
Then they tear off somebodies draws and be like
Awww too big too small, that shit ain't cool mayn

Verse 2

Murder, it's just a part of the game, you get you jugular opened
Up if you say the say the wrong niggas name, I hear the guard screamin
Shut the fuck up, and as I look to my right side I see
Niggas gettin cut, shanked, stabbed, wounded, sliced
Watch your adam's apple when the guards hit the lights
But the real niggas luv me, though I'm 1990-sick
Plus I'm not the type of nigga that won't swole up quick
So past me the potatoes nigga, I don't mean to be rude
But if you starve for a minute you gonna fuck with this fool
Up in the county jail, niggas be startin them riots
And if you see some of murder, shut you mouth and be quiet
If you are hard keep your shank nigga, there ain't no tellin
When the mafia bailin up in the cells where the niggas dwellin
Only the strong survive, I ain't no motherfuckin cat
I ain't got nine lives, so bring it on motherfucker
I'm tellin him to bring it on in my cell
Get my yokes on all night long
Bustin lyrics with my killa partners they so sick
Sittin around all night spittin bout G shit
Said he had three keys the motherfuckers call him fiends
Now he's stuck up in the county with some niggas like these
Ain't no muthafuckin luv up in the county jail
Picture you life a livin hell if you slangin yea...

Chorus with news reporter

If the guard want to come and find mine
2 hands and a Razor blade
Then the officer gonna have to get my
2 hands off the razor blade
When I wake up in the morning and see it again
Then someones gonna have to end up D.D.Dead
And if your Friend got soaked then he a D.D.Dead

How a small law inforcement budget can't even put a dent
On an estimated 100 billion dollars of weed in this business

Verse 3

Keep your hands in your pockets and your shoulders to the wall
Keep your hands in your pockets and your shoulders to the wall
Keep your hands in your pockets and your shoulders to the wall
And if you don't walk straight, then they gonna have to beat you
Until you have to crawl, this ain't no bullshit
You gonna mind somebody, niggas comin up in here
Thinkin that they bought it like they John Gotti
And still get the fuck broke off
Take the hardest muthafucka and turn him into something soft
I keep a shank up in my sandwich, so I can do damage
To motherfuckers who wanna test my nuts and handle this
Looked at my cellmate he threw up his set
But Trigger guy so hard died with a tattoo on his chest
So know this gangsta shit is poppin, the guards is comin
Motherfuckers is runnin, I hear the Po-Po gunnin
While the bullets is screamin, I hear get the fuck on the floor
Niggas holler man damn it's the murder show
So get you muthafuckin shank and nigga beware
Of the Sh Sh Sheriff cause he's out there...

She call me on the phone breathin and moanin
I'm seein phone call, sayin she wet, hot, and alone and
Baby we could corleone it and fuck till the sunrise in the mornin
I'm cocked strong, a gang of condoms, and I'm feelin like conan
Restin for ya brown skin and ya soft thick thighs
I'm on the freeway wit a hard dick doing 125
Keep it hot baby, rub it if it start gettin cold
So much passion, love it when you stay in that mode
I was knockin on the door fore she hung up the phone
She opened it up, grabbed me by my collar, And it was on
We did some hardcore fuckin, dead in the eyes
As I got front and back and side to side
Lift yo legs up baby, throw 'em over my shoulder
Wrap the dog shit, let you see the range on my rover
Take a ride through ya sugar walls hittin them corners
You in bed wit a felon tonight behind closed doors

[Hook]
We can do it all, behind closed doors
Behind closed doors
Just turn off the lights, and I'm all yours

[Verse 2]
Up against the wall, rubbin yo thighs, Lickin yo neck
As we embrace, face to face, tongue kissin, passionate sex
In them dark rooms, fuckin by the light of the moon
Blowin circles wit c-c-chronic smoke caressin ya womb
Whisperin in ya ear while I hit it slow from the back
Moanin cause she knowin how deep I'm bout to go in the crack
Gettin silly sometimes, in the morning when I awaken
Tryin to hit it from the back while she cookin eggs and bacon
Had to reinforce the frame cause the bed keep breakin
It's like an inch of the room, the whole room be shakin
Fixin to start a fire, moan if you wanna
Cause baby if ya body got curves, I'm hittin corners
Wit my thug thing wrapped between ya peaches and cream
Pull up to ya bumper in my black limosine
Triple X like a magazine, we put on a show
The only audience is me and you behind closed doors

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
My objective is to get you more wet like champagne
Bed bump against the wall, neighbors call and complain
Boxers, shorts, sling shots, Still got on my socks
Now we naked playin twister, drinkin Hennessy shots
Bout the ring around the bed baby, just you and me
We can go a couple of rounds wit no referee
Behind closed doors, body soft like marshmallows
Fixin the pillow, black thong, black stilletto
Take old bennie, still look like a cattage grill
Talkin to her friend, she tellin I'm daddy's ill
Never shout wit ya bomb-ass beautiful body
Potential to put a nigga to sleep like a hot toddy
No corns on ya feet, I can see through ya sandals
Baby let's do it like animals on discovery channel
Behind closed doors

You know that old school bitch, she like to get in funk
It's splittin motherfuckers by the seams
My grandaddy Mr. AR-15
Said he was my only family
Shoot straight, and please don't jam me
My own Glock pistol-whipped me in my fuckin head
Cause he said, I wouldn't buy the infrared
Got in a fight at a club, my gat started walkin
Told me to shut the fuck up and let him do the talkin

Pull up to your bumper with a fully loaded magazine
Robbin your motherfuckin ass clean
Blow the heart out a motherfucker back
Nigga shit on hisself, when I pull out my strap
Got a chrome fo'-five, bout nine in the clip
In two ?? days, begin to mobb and dip

Where niggas murder in the first from a verse that spit
Bitch-ass niggas, expire, retire
Stab him in the throat with the Dayton spoke wire
So don't get caught up in the mix
I, let you motherfuckers know quick, I'm Born II Die

Hehehahahahahahahahah

Now come and take the realness
Fuckin' these funky hoes will make you feel this
Drippin' sensation stickin' your ace in the wrong place
And you'll be ass out dickless, passin' out when you get this
AIDS shit in your grave, ditch will be dug with a quickness
So this is the phase of the days when I grew up
Reminiscin' and trippin' off all them hoes I done fucked
But it's all good and plenty, I just can't count how many trampy hoes I done did it to
Licked it, did it, split it too
But shit is cool makin' the thrilla of Manilla
Scoop up the scrilla boy that cuchi be a killa
You can feel a order up with a nut and then bounce
And have that ass comin' up shorter than a fuckin' quarter ounce

[Gangsta P]
Let's get toe down off some X-O, puffin' on the cripto
Bent corner eyers up on her, super bad low down dirty shame
No need to know your age, bitch, what's your name?
Said her name was Tammy, lived with her granny
All I'm thinkin' about is gettin' in her panties
Got the digits, called her later on that night
At a two dome sex, flossin' big elex
Cocked the roof back, bitch, blaze the sack
Reached the destination, no hesitation
Out of my clothes in the guts about to nut
No protection, after two hours hopped out the shower
Dressed in Eddie Bauer, livin' like a true playas should
Six years later: test positive cause the ho was no good

[Hook]
If you wanna get your groove on, come and do a little somethin' with me
If you wanna get your groove on, let's wrap it up before we fuck
If you wanna get your groove on, come and do a little somethin' with me
If you wanna get your groove on, let's wrap it up before we fuck

[Celly Cel]
A-I-D crooked letter
Mothafuckas better strap up when they come together
It's a top notch so you ain't thinkin'
Got your battlefields sinkin', caught late night full of weed, drinkin'
Got ya creepin' in the unknown
Steered you wrong even if you get your head blown, fool, you still gone
Switch up your tactics: fuck with prophylaxis
It ain't about that raw dickin' her and nuttin' on the mattress
You didn't know these hoes will put the tags on your toes
Don't knows crossin' up the game because she chose
Listen to your homie Celly, nigga, before you hit the telly, nigga
Have a box of rubbers ready, nigga

[Almon D of 187-Fac]
I can't lie, this whole AIDS situation got my brain drownin' in illusions
Settin' niggas up for the conclusions
I ain't sayin' that I'm gonna live forever
Gotsta fuck new, get sometime in the future
Don't got no babies, what about the day when you get married
I hope I'm layin' in bed with a virgin with a meal that's urgent
She heard that I was livin' my lifestyle lavishly
Flashbacks of fuckin' her cousin in the alley
Smokin' on the twamp sack that she bought the jimmy hats
Three O'clock in the morning, sideways I was cuttin' the Pontiac strapped

[Hook]

[Den-Fenn of 187-Fac]
Well, here's a serious situation that we facin'
It starts off by doin' the nasty without no patience
Forgettin' about the condom, usin' and abusin' the drugs and methinfedamies
She wanted to suck my dick head so bad she was beggin' me
So I stepped to this straight bitch named Sally, Sally
Threw my slugs at a scallywag at a club in the valley
Leather trench, all hair down to her shoulders and back
Some Guess jeans all deep down and her pussy read fat
To be exact one of my niggas pulled my coat tail
And told me that the bitch was hectic: A-I to the D-S infected

[G-Nut of 187-Fac]
Mothafuckas be runnin' up in this bitch without no prophylactics
Filthy tactics, may as well pull the strap to your head and blast it
Suicidal decisions, livin' your life on the edge slippin'
With one foot off in the grave and the other one on a banana peelin'
But I ain't trippin', red ribbons on my chest
No chemotherapy treatments needed cause I'm a make it stretch
To my climax, strapped all over my dick
And when I digs I blow they mind back and then I grab my shit

[Hook]

[Spice 1]
Some of you niggas can't even say condoms
Some niggas be talkin' about conderves or condos, straight raw dickin' hoes
You don't know that ho, man, that bitch can't be trusted
Better be strapped with about four condoms if you plan on keeping your life
You're gonna be feelin' kinda fucked up and faulty
When you rappin' up on that stage and your dick fall off into the audience
Silent but deadly way of murder, it's mighty sick
Gotta have a bullet proof vest for your dick
Seventeen with the fat hydraulics
See, us west coast niggas is the most psychotic
Hittin' switches in my old school with four, fuck three pumps
My homie said that bitch had more pizzazz than "P" funk
I'm peepin' in the bitch out at the ho spot
Tryin' to throw that virus to my homie
Betta watch these bitches cause they're fake and phony

[Hook]Yeah
Spice muthafuckin One
Coolin in Cali
Kickin that gangsta shit
You get with it?

[ VERSE 1 ]
Hopped in my Blazer, mashed off and left a boy in his car, then
Tagged him with the skull and bones, cause he be soften
Hollow like a head without no brains inside
And his girl was so damn small, you had to strain your eyes
Got to the corner, hit a left, seen the HPD
That's when I knew that they were after S-p-i-c-e
Turned up my music and dashed, goin 90, I mashed
Bullet holes all in my window from a 12-gauge blast
He was all on my ass, I had to think real fast
Hooked a left, all of a sudden heard a boom and a crash
Tried to catch the cold, sold the devil his soul
Had his car and his face wrapped around a pole
With my vogues still smokin hit 580 to Oakland
Still upset with the police because my window was broken
But my beat was still bumpin and my amp was still pumpin
And my nine was in my lap if any funk was jumpin
Got the 20th and Nice as I kicked my tune
Hooked a left on 23rd and seen my homeboy June
Jumped straight out like an arrow, had more gold than the pharaoh
Had my Nikey sweat suit on and it was read like a sparrow
I told him what had happened and he already knew
He said, "You got a little funky with a fake-ass crew
The bass went boom and your gun went bang
And all you could see was flames"
At that very moment Coke and Ray started laughin
And slapped each other's hands and said, "It's all about blastin"
In the city streets

City streets

[ VERSE 2 ]
Kickin it at the park shootin craps with some homies
My first roll was a 7, so niggas can't get on me
So since my point is 4, I left a Little Joe
I'm kissin on the dice and I'm pimpin em like my ho
So then I roll again, I'm fuckin with Big Ben
Now I ain't fade jack because I'm mackin' with that ten
I picked up the dice, shook em up and rolled once mo'
What came out the do'? Whaddaya know, I hit that 4
Fuckin with the dank I'm hearin Marvin Gaye's oldies
Fadin another 20, took a sip of my 40
There go my homie G-Nut with the gin and the juice
My nigga's always fuckin with that 187 proof
I took a big-ass gulp and feelin quite tipsy
Knowin I'm like this these niggas try to cheat me
Huh, they can't get with me, I put em in his place
Then G-Nut threw the gin and busted a nigga in his face
I thought it was quite funny, and I began to smirk
The fat-ass niggas face was grounded lyin in the dirt
So I picked up my mail, and I'm about to go
Cause I'm about that mo' money, mo' money, mo'
Now homie on his face, he rolled over just like that
And said, "This is a jack, gimme all my fuckin money back"
I act like I was scared, gave his money back fast
And when he tried to leave, I busted a cap up in his ass
These niggas out the kitchen if you can't take the heat
Cause muthafuckas gank ya, shank ya, sank ya in the city streets

The city streets

[ VERSE 3 ]
A few weeks back I robbed a nigga for a ki
Kickin it on the block, slingin d to o-p-e
Yo, runnin from the five-o, you think this shit is funny
By any means necessary I must make my money
If niggas try to fade me, I pull out my nine
And pop-pop-pop-pop a nigga from behind
In this world of madness muthafuckas die
Niggas sling and bang, and bitches always lie
So I choose to be murderous and chop up niggas' bodies
And set like an example, a villain like John Gotti
The muthafuckin gangsta S-p-i-c-e
They ring my mobile phone, now who the fuck could that be?
Bitch, I said don't call me, I'm busy clockin g's
I thought it was the fuzz, but some niggas told me 'freeze!'
The barrel was my back, it's a muthafuckin jack
I knew I shoulda packed, I ain't goin out like that
These niggas caught me slippin, and fuck a yellow sack
Niggas must be trippin cause they Daytons touch my back
I hopped out of my shit and told him go ahead
And when he tried to leave I busted a cap up in his head
With blood all over his face is how the homie fled
I dragged him out the car and filled his corpse full of lead
These niggas out the kitchen if you can't take the heat
Cause bitch, I'm a gangsta, shank ya, sank ya in the city streets

Aight, Banks
Let's pack the shit up, mayn(Intro: Spice 1)
What's wrong nigga? What's wrong huh?

With the dead motherfucker in the passenger seat
And it's fo' to the motherfuckin' five
G-a-gat that ass leave 'em dead in the ?eyes?
Red Rum on the late night, catch my case right at the crack hut

Tall cash, can't let he cut my grass
Don't make me have to come back and split your parents house in half
With my Sig-Sauer P226-Diana Ross cousin Nina - Mr. Meaner, body bleeder
Heartless, empty the cartridge roll
Smartless, get out of dodge, so cold
Hollow point hot ones dipped in garlic
I lives at the bar like an Alcoholic
Niggas think that I be bluffin' when I tell 'em I'm a good shot
But I'm also into some other things like ice picks and piano strings
Bitch, I'm tryin' to get nigga rich
Open up shop, cotton candy and licorice, uh

Could somebody pass me a clip and a trigger
Walk across the party pistol whip a nigga

And they'll never breathe again like Toni Braxton
Cause I don't see nothing wrooong with a little brotha jack
So say "what up?" to the 187 FAC
Nappy head ass muthafuckas wearin' plats
Kickin' back like a muthafucka slangin' sex
Ready to peel a nigga cap if they got the nap
So if you're funkin' with the FAC
Better to stay strapped
Cause we'll be comin' up at your back with the black Gat
Nigga, and you be feelin' kinda fucked up
When your homie dropped, it's simple
You can't run away from my Glock

(Chorus): 2x
Doncha runaway

(Verse 2):

Cause I don't be fuckin' around
When it comes to bustin' that steel
I'm too real, niggas feeel me
When I kick this gangsta ass shit that you never heard
But fuck what you've heard

For your muthafuckin' life
Cause Nine Kelly I'mma make 'em stutter
Make 'em drop, nigga
You can't run away from my Glock

(Chorus): 2x

(Verse 3):
Comin' like the Lench Mobb swingin' on the vine
Bailin' out peace to my muthafuckin' Nine
Pullin' my cap back ready to serve they ass
Givin' a fuck about what the next nigga done up in the past
Nigga, I like to let a nigga have a bloody body
Don't think I'm bad, no box and no karate
Just a big fat Gat for them suckas
I ain't scared to you muthafuckas
Shiiit, and nigga that's how it be
"rollin' with my muthafuckin' strap on the side of me"
So don't come at me with that shit

Ratta to the motherfuckin tat is how I stomp this
Much love for niggas that's sleepin up in the darkness
Cause I'm a crooked nigga 2 like Pac
I do a 1-8-7 with this motherfuckin Glock
Shot you in the body
Had to break the gat off in his ass at the party, nigga
Crazy as fuck, I thought you knew me
Quick to put the bullets up in the motherfuckin Uzi, bitch
A OG nigga, so I gotta G-O and creep slow
And get this nigga while he's steppin out his car door
Bust, bang, I let my nuts hang, chewed out my Mustang
And let this motherfuckin gat sang
A bloody Glock and a pocket full of rock
Got my shit on cock cause my slang don't stop
In the darkness I ain't the nigga who's slippin
I get the clip in, slam dunk it in the gat like Scottie Pippen
And watch these niggas scream like bitches
I break em off somethin proper
And dump they ass in ditches

Chorus:

1-8-7, dump the niggas up in ditches
Fat nina for the player hatin bitches
1-87, dump the niggas up in ditches
I got a fat nina for the player hatin bitches
1-87, dump the niggas up in ditches
Fat nina for the player hatin bitches
1-87, dump the niggas up in ditches
I got a fat nina for the player hatin bitches

Engrave my name on the motherfuckin hollow tip
A autograph from the nigga, killer, lunatic
13 for the birdy, fuckin him in the game
When I get my hands dirty, nigga
You wanna squab with the nina
Comin up, wanna gat you with this trigger happy finger, bitch
Still whoopin a nigga ass with some St. Ide's
Jealous niggas be wantin to gat me because they can't rise
I sell my shit wherever I want to sell my shit
I dig a ditch and let him meet nina, my little bitch
Cause a nigga ain't soft
I fuck around and break every nigga in your hood off
Somethin proper cause I can't be caught slippin
7 in the mornin cookin keys in my kitchen
Here comes the pig bangin on my door
Screamin some shit about that 5.0
They must of seen me kill that man and run off in a hurry
Left the cola and the gats and the money cause a nigga done

Chorus 1/2

187 erupt, another motherfuckin walk by in your hood
I broke a gat in his ass because it's all good
And now the boys in blue wanna come after
The motherfuckin East Bay gangster murder master!
I'mma make that bacon fry, if he keep followin me around
Fuckin off my indo high
Pigs don't notice shit, 1-87 is the nigga you're fuckin with
When I was young I used to get my gun
Fuck with the G.T.A and bust at they ass for fun
Put the piggy in a blanket and when the G.T.A stall

Pistol pop in they ass, see niggas be gettin this twisted
It's that bitch that killed ya
Took all your money peeled ya
Seven niggas bust in the room with AK's
While a nigga be puttin on his jimmy
All of a sudden they shoot up your Vuitton
Before you can hit the broccoli
See money-a-made that nigga, that nigga didn't make that money
Left them niggas jacked up, and the bitch she macked him
He's a busta, punk ass nigga, y'all know the streets
That's why that nigga naked layin dead in between some bloody sheets
It's just a part of the game he didn't feel
Bitches will kill, fuck a nigga, out his last d-uh dollar bill
You don't know that ho main that bitch can't be trusted
Dusted and di-motherfuckin-sgusted

[Hook: E-40]
Some cold hearted shit

Cold hearted bitches

Let's let of some two or threes on the other side of t-uh-town
Draw the attention on the other s-uh-side of town (other side of town)
And wait for the po-po shift to change, ghetto shootin range
Revenge on the r-uh-rebound, war games
Droughts, ouch, lost clientele but I will prevail
By sellin the broccoli dank instead of the crack cocaine
Try not to steal narcotics
When these punk MC's and bitches be the reason why
The smoke be comin up out the chop, with my nigga 'Pac

[2Pac]
Dear God, can you forgive me? My future's lookin sick
I'm in my rag hittin switches I'm suspicious of these bitches
I keep on, calllin, but ain't nobody pickin up
I think she's stallin, this evil bitch is tryin ta set me up
Came all alone if it's on then it's on
Where's my motherfuckin chrome, only jealous niggas roam
It's a war zone (war zone) but I'm a man so with gun in hand
I'm on my way to see this ho you know the fuckin plan
Can't understand, but the things ain't the same
You could die over these bitches if you slippin in the game
Niggas gang bang, but bitches gang bang too
Give up that good thang, and put that pistol to your brain
If you a smart figure, don't have no love in your heart nigga
Any complications pull the trigger, dusted and disgusted
Bitches can't be trusted, you know the rules
They underhanded, she planned it, you fuckin fool

[Interlude]
(These hoes out here tryin to hold a nigga's heart
So a nigga get his money fucked with
Almost in-laws)

Bay Area playa, tryin ta have shit major
And a bitch won't save ya

Action packed, I let the mini-mac smack that ass

[Spice 1]
Them hoes jacked that ass
Nigga woulda got smokin on that hash
Can't have my cash, better go and take your nigga stash

Never was no love for the mark-ass, the lo pink (the lo pink)
You love them Bootsy bitches, can't let them pussy bitches

[E-40]
Gank that ass, betta hide your cash and check her fast
Pump your brakes nigga, slow your roll don't go too fast
Cause bulletproof ain't doin no good no mo' no mo' no mo' no mo'
Now, niggas comin up dead with they brains blew out on the fuckin floor
Damn, hollow points to flesh tears through the teflon vest
Now r-uh-rest
Pull a plug on a flatline over those, one nigga less
One nigga less, from coast to coast, to the East to the West
Crushin the flesh, dem bitches played a game of death
Look over your shoulder watch your back don't even trust it

Emptied the clip off up in his fuckin face
His partner callin for backup as I was breakin out, nigga refused to
Die, that's what I heard him shout

Fuckin blast of a shotgun

Smellin' stale fresh out the county jail
Coppers gave me hell in a cell
But now its Mo' Murder to make mail
They thought my heart was playin' life at a different pitch
But I stick to the script, dump a snitch in a ditch
It's '94 I can't be fuckin' around
Paranoia of a jack so I'm quick to drop down
The only way I gets my mail is to be offin' yo' ass
With a AK or a Uzi screamin'"give me your cash nigga"
So back to fuck on up
Cause can't nobody stop this nigga that's sellin a D that's raw and uncut
Fuckin' over fiends
Laughin' in their faces sellin' soap to niggas, could die any day
Niggas come showin' up in them jacks, G
Another homie eyes wide open dead in my backseat
We never thought that they would get him
My nigga fuck like it's over we'd never knew that the bullet hit him
Thought to myself was cocaine with my homie's life
He picked the crime Do or Die now he pays the price
To look in struggle on his face with his gat in his hand
My nigga died with the face of a desperate man

So we can tear this face

Check motherfuckin one check one two
I gotta gets my mail, that's what I gotta do
And don't nobody run up on me
Cause Franklin and Grant is my only motherfuckin' homie
I made a deal with the devil and sold my soul
Threw up off O.E. at fourteen-years old
Young hog ass nigga never ever soft
Got me a strap and learned not to shoot my balls off
And all the youngsters sneakin' pass the bottle
Because the Gs, pimps, and hustlers was the motherfuckin' role model
And every time we had a house party
It was just the chance for a nigga to see another nigga dead body
And nobody stayed around for sequels
Cause the nigga that was bustin' was spreadin' bullets 'round equal
Now they mobbin', I'm seein' sparks hearin' shots
Pistols pop, another motherfucker flop
On the asphalt, stuck by the fo'-fo'
Flatline, ambulance put him in the do'
Loud screams from his homies yellin' "I'mma smoke 'em!"
Feelin' bad cause his partner's own blood choked him
A touchin' scene, niggas screamin' in the rain
Looked in his homeboy's face, his homie said his name
Now he'll be lookin' for that nigga with the gat and
Ready for that red rum with the face of a desperate man

[ Hook ]

'94 is gettin' hostile nigga
I gotta watch my shit, mug on my face nigga, hound dog mean bitch
I'm muggin' every nigga that be walkin' by
Is it true can his hand be quicker than my eye?
I'm wonderin' if I gotta pull out my steel
Cause motherfuckers they can't feel me they won't look at me real
So fo' to the motherfuckin fo'
If I have to let 'em know not to play me like a ho

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Fully auto, my only motto, forever thugging
Chevy on 6s, them Forgiatos ain't ever scrubbing
Watch honeys run through 100 bottles like it was nothing
We leave the club with two foreign models, her and her cousin
Niggas say that we the brand new thug life
Washing dirty money with this mic, I wish it was right
Tell a song, sipping Perignon, fuck a Bud Light
Tony said the world is yours, only if you plug right
My God, when they bury me, pray my casket be solid gold
Funeral packed with a separate section for all my hoes
Most niggas choose it and lose it quickly, but I was chose
Cook it and sell it, my mama smell it up in my clothes
Betyour favorite rapper get extorted for his paycheck
Mask on my skull, they ain't identify my face yet
We sticking suckers up, I hope they sticking to the cheddar
You pussy niggas might be rich but you ain't rich forever

[Hook: Freddie Gibbs]
And he can go hard, but I'ma go the hardest
Thugging from the start, don't get a nigga started
Came up in the realest, I know the streets starving
You know we with the business, my niggas go retarded
When we ride
When we ride on our enemies
Never hide from our enemies
'Til we ride our enemies
Fully loaded .45 on my enemies

[Verse 2: Daz Dillinger]
I go, ha-ha-hard up on you motherfuckers
Immediately cock it back and spray one of you fucking suckers
You off-brand niggas get down with the punishment
It‚Äôs D-P-G, Dogg Pound, so who you want it with
Them gangbang niggas is active, capping shit in the active
With them old-school Tommy gun extended clip
I ride around the city in expensive whips
Should've known that them gangster niggas don‚Äôt trip
Flag swinging, me and Deep nigga, yeah we gangbanging
Bringing down the ashes if you niggas flaming
Aim for your dome, head shots, slug shots
Police put me throughout, 2-1 on my mugshot
Crazy-ass niggas, yeah we insane
Put the pistol in your mouth, blow out your brain
Bail out on eight million dollar bond
Soon as I hit the streets, nigga, it‚Äôs back on

[Hook: Freddie Gibbs]

[Verse 3: Spice 1]
When I finger fuck my .45
I hit a nigga right between his eyes
Pull out the heat, make him dance, and do the dougie
Before I blow the back of his shit out, it can get ugly
Yes, y'all, I put his cherry pie on the wall
When I ride on my enemies, niggas know it‚Äôs uncut and raw
Mr. Bossalini, you can try to stand guard
But niggas like me be going Taliban hard
I spit grenades and piss bullets
Eat a bitch nigga for breakfast when I aim and pull it
Doing wonders for this bread, I Pillsbury these motherfuckers
When his doughboy die with the heat, I carry in my clutches
I‚Äôm a natural born rider, like my nigga Freddie Gibbs
Steady going hard and riding with steady clips
I been thugging from the beginning, you niggas soft as linen
I wear my black Jordans to match with my MAC-10

[Verse 1: Spice 1]
We serving chickens you damn sure can't get at Roscoe's
If you don't want to see no murder then keep your eyes closed
Nigga shake the dice up, roll 'em if it's one or ten
They won't be able to put your ass together again
Leave you in Reece's Pieces, rolling in white cornices
Knocking out teethes, I know where we can get the blackheads cheapest
From my homie down the street on the block
He copping everything from Desert Eagles down to them mini-Glocks
If niggas fuck off the money we raise the murder stats
Me and my nigga Mack 10 committing terrorist acts
You see us bailing don't mumble under your breath
Have the heart to say fuck you so I can put five in your chest nigga
Don't be no punk, I put my Uzi where my mouth is
Yay under couches running out of crack houses
We down and dirty for the birdy thirty-five a sack
Nigga give up the stack it's Fetty Chico and The Mack

I'm in a murderous mindstate
I'm on so much dope and coke I can't even do my line straight
I smoke that warren that shit put me in a trance
And since my last LP they start calling me Mack Manson
Now when I come around punks know they're gone
Smell my pistol around and fall straight into a coma
So take if you want it that's my number one motto
Hitting licks like the lotto, with a four-five bottle
And assault rifles like Rambo full of ammo
Dump a nigga in his chest and watch him bleed through his flesh
???...... chicken hawking
You kill a nigga, you kill his bitch so she can't talk
So I smoked the bitch and made it simple
I put one in her temple and got horny as a nympho
So with a hard dick and guns, a bad bitch dies
I take my two fingers and then I slowly close her eyes

[Verse 3: Spice 1]

In my h-hooptie with my uzi t-talking to me
Telling me thought another lick we can go pull off
He told me keep your mask on don't take your hood off
So me bail into Burger King and me pistol whip the guard
Everybody up on the floor nobody try to make it hard
Another guard was hiding he jumped out and bust at me
So I let him count the bullets in my C-L-I-P
Me hear them sirens ringing and me take off with the stack
Bailing without the stretch it's Fetty Chico and The Mack
