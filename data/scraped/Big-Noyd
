[Verse 1: Prodigy]
Ayo, Queens get the Money long time no cash
I'm caught up in the hustle when the guns go blast
The fool retaliated so I had to think fast
Pull out my heat first, he pull out his heat last
Now who the fuck you think is living to this day?
I'm tryna tell these young niggas crime don't pay
They looked at me and said "Queen's niggas don't play
Do your thing, I'll do mine kid stay outta my way"
It's type hard tryna survive in New York state
Can't stop 'til I'm eating off a platinum plate
Po po comes around and tries to relocate me
Lock me up forever but they can't deflate me
Cause having cash is highly addictive
Especially when you're used to having money to live with
I thought step back look at my life as a whole
Ain't no love it seems the devil done stole my soul
I'm out for delfia, selfia, P's not helping ya
I'm tryna get this Lexus up, and plus a cellular
Yo, Big Noyd! (What up cousin?) I can't cope
With all these crab niggas tryna shorten my rope

[Verse 2: Big Noyd]
Yo, it's the R-A-double-P-E-R
N-O-Y-D, niggas can't fuck with me
Coming straight outta QB, pushing an Infiniti
You ask can I rip it constantly? Mentally?
Definitely, to the death of me, come and test me
Trust me, nigga couldn't touch me if he snuff me
So bust me, you're gonna have to, cause I'mma blast you
My lyrical like a miracle, ill spiritual
I'm born with it, I'm getting on with it
And I'mma have it 'til I'm fucking dead and gone with it
Cause I'm a what? Composer of hardcore, a lyrical destructor
Don't make me buck ya, cause I'm a wild mothafucka
You know my flow, you know my steelo
Even pack my gat when I go to see my PO
Jump out my hooptie, pass my gat and my lucci
To my shorty in case my PO try to troop me
To the island, and if I start wildin
Flipping on niggas walking around with the nice gold medallions
But she didn't violate me, so I escaped see
Back to Queen's pumping the fiends making more CREAM
Know what I mean? I'm a natural born hustler
Won't try to cut ya, pull out my 4 4 and bust ya

[Verse 3: Havoc]
Hey Yo, ain't no time for faking jacks cause brothers who fake jacks
Get laid on their backs, the streets is real
Can't roll without steel, I feel how I feel
Cause I was born to kill, do what I gotta
To eat a decent meal, brothers is starving
Don't try to find a job son, it's all about robbing
So don't be alarmed when we come through
We supposed to, if you opposed to, get your face blown dude
Off the map, cause I react, attack
A brother wasn't blessed with wealth, so I act like that
Drug dealing, only mess with shorties thats appealin
I'm fronting on the world once I start 4-wheeling
Cause back on the 41st Side, we do a ride
Sipping E&J, getting bent all night
Yo, who that? I never seen him in my whole life, step to his business
Cause it's only right, po-po ain't around so I grab my pound
Money retaliated so I hit the ground, my life is on the line
Gotta hold my projects down, can't see myself getting bodied
By a clown.....ass nigga that ain't even from my town
Hit him up in the chest and now he's laying me down dead
And up from under the benches I started hearing sirens
I stop firing, to cut ass like a diamond, jetted to the cribpiece
What a relief, stashed the heat then proceeded to peep
Out the window, call my son, "yo son we got beef
But no question, money had a problem so I solved him"

[Verse 4: Prodigy]
I got my mind on the stick-up, now it's time to get paid
Thinking of ways to take loot already made
There's crime in the air, ain't no time to be afraid
Give me yours and get laid, give up the goods and get sprayed
I got lots of love, for my crew that is
No love for them other crews and rival kids
All them out-of-town niggas know what time it is
And if they don't, they need to buy a watch, word up
Caught up in the cross-fire get theyself hurt up
While I be sipping gin straight in a plastic cup
On a park bench on 12th Street, my whole crew's famous
You tried to bust your gat and keep it real but you nameless
First of all slow down, you on the wrong route
Let me put you on your feet and show you what's it all about
The street life ain't nothing to play with
No jokes no games kid for years I been doing the same shit
Just drinking liquor, doing bids, extorting crack heads
And sticking up the stick-up kids[Produced by Havoc]

[Verse 1 : Prodigy]
Now, '94 to '95, innocent without crime...
(Drop that shit)Yeah, yeah, check it out
Now run for your life, or you wanna get your heat, whatever
We can die together
As long as I send your maggot ass to the essence
I don't give a fuck about my presence
I'm lost in the blocks of hate and can't wait
For the next crab nigga to step and meet fate
I'm lethal when I see you, there is no sequel
24-7, mac 11 is my people
So why you wanna end your little life like this?
Cause now you bump heads with kids that's lifeless
I live by the day only if I survive
The last night, damn right, I ain't tryin' to fight
We can settle this like some grown men on the concrete floor
My slugs will put a stop to your hardcore
Ways of action, I grab the gat, then
Ain't no turning back when I start blastin'
Pick up the handle and insert the potion
Cock the shit back in a calm like motion
No signs of anger or fear cause you the one in danger
Never share your plans with a stranger, word is bond

[Hook: repeat 2X]
I put the drop on you kid, now I got you
You got the heart to get busy without your crew?
Let's get it on nigga, do what we gotta do
You buckin' me, I'm buckin' right back at you

[Verse 2 : Havoc]
Fuck where you at kid, it's where you're from
Cause where I'm from, niggas pack nothin' but the big guns
Around my way, niggas don't got remorse for out-of-towners
Come through fronting and get stuffed with the 3-pounder
The loud sounder, ear ringer
And I'm a point the finger, at all you wannabe gunslingers
You got a real ice grill but are you really real
Step to the hill and I'ma test your gun skills
Cause real niggas don't try to profile
You just a chump who needs to get drunk to buckwild
But swing that bullshit this way
And I'm a make your visit to the bridge a motherfucking short stay
Queensbridge, that's where I'm from
The place where stars are born and phony rappers get done
6 blocks and you might not make it through
What you gonna do when my whole crew is blazing at you
With macs and tecs to lend to get your dome crush
You thought that you could come around my way and beef, stupid fuck
What the hell you smoking? What the fuck possessed you
To come out your face, now I have to wet you
Throw on my Timbs, black mask and black serpent
Twist a nigga cap, then jump in the J-30

[Hook]

[Verse 3 : Rae and Ghostface]
Who's the richest nigga in the project, who got it locked
Rocking Convertibles, drop tops and mad hot
Peace to that whiz kid and playas on his team
Who's organized, all eyeballs is on CREAM
And your whole clique got nothin' but raw shit
Whip after whip, stay flashing your dick on tricks
Your whole crew's ravishing, team's untouchable
In the jungle, banging NaS, Mobb Deep and Wu
There's money out there, guns catch crumbs, those are your sons
Jums is in the mailboxes, bitches holding your guns
You know what's out there, thousands of gram, wrapped in Saran
Sealed tight, keep the freshness, that's how we expand
Masked Avenger, drop your gun, son, now surrender
Get ninjaed on the island, plus the Bridge, boy remember

[Verse 4 : Big Noyd]
My little thug's selling drugs and he's struggling
The game got him bugging, I tried to tell him slow down cousin
But he vexed and niggas getting wet up in the projects
But with no doubt, shorties out for his respect
But is his brain insane from the lye?
From smoking that 118 tiny tye
Why, a nigga just died last week
As he swore he was grown and he's a thug in the street
But it's like that, my crew pump cracks and we pack mac
His eyes is wild with the rezzy monkey on his back
But I'm stressed and he need to be blessed
With a firepack, don't even go there cause it ain't like that
Slow down baby, he said, what, you trying to play me?
You must be crazy, pulled out the heat and almost blazed me
Then he was Swayze, the shot must of dazed me
Thug selling drugs, busting slugs, but he ain't crazy[Havoc]
It be a buck-fifty, your chance of runnin is infinte
Slugs that leave niggas drugged like a chick slip the Mickey
I'm so on the low it'd take a Navy Seal to get me
When I surface, if not chips to Benz is the purpose
On your team I'll pull the curtain, a beautiful hurtin
'til my eyes see the blood, that mean the creep start workin
Niggas never learnin that they eyes keep lurkin
Have ya janitor pumpin your X5 murkin
Skid marks the street, your heart skips a beat
Beef? Nigga overcook that meat
Get no sleep, only rest is in between the blink
My life story was written in blood, permanent ink
Killer instinct, R.I.P. 'em
Gotta think like that cause forever I be needin 'em
Plan flawless, mistakes never repeatin 'em
Some love, some hate me, bitches in the head beatin 'em
Niggas wanna ride by the crib all slow
We clap mothafucka, want a real rap show?
Fiends are rushin when the mack blow, dead in my castle
And in the blink watch how quick life pass you

[Hook: Vita]
What's wrong with mothafuckas when will the ever learn
Keep playin with that fire and that ass is gettin burned
Fuckin with semi-autos, one foot is in the grave
We givin all of y'all somethin to be afraid of

[Big Noyd]
Let me tell you how it's goin down, it's on now
Niggas used to love me, now they wanna hate me now
I'm that same nigga with the tech, holdin the spot down
Except I'm pushin a Lex, lettin the top down
But wait, you don't think I live a pop life now
That's hate, you could get popped right now
Me don't play, I keep a gun around my way
And I'm a fuckin drama king like my nigga Kayslay
Sex, drugs, money and murder all day
It's rules, guidlines and codes, we obey
Don't even trip, IMD it's that I claim
Infamous Mobb Deep nigga, ready to bang
Nigga don't think shit stink, then shit hit the fans
So I don't slip, I'mma shit with my gun in my hand
It's a thug thing y'all niggas wouldn't understand and
Y'all keep guns we keep our shit bangin

[Hook]

[Prodigy]
You a bitch-ass nigga, I had you killed
All they had was your picture at the funeral
No casket, you bastards be missin
My jewels, my whip, my rims we bitchin
My guns be the heat that'll make you blister
My mens, my Timbs'll stomp you niggas
No shit, no clip, don't fuck with us
It's no problem, I bring it to the best of them
From the old to the new and the rest of them
No love, just slugs for ya body dunn
Just pain, just sufferin and worst then that
You let me get my hands on you so I'm takin advantage
And that shit that you pulled ain't do me no damage
You don't know me, but we bout to change that shit
Wrap that nigga up like a package
Fuck all them niggas, buck all them faggots

[Hook]

[Outro: Vita]
Yeah, QB (Yeah)
Mobb Deep, dola
It's going down, we're taking over
Vita, gettin this dough
We don't call it Murder for nothin (Murda! Murda, Murda!)
I'll send you on, Prodigy, Big Noyd, Havoc
Yeah, y'all see us, it ain't a game..Yeah
Oh..Come on..Yeah..You see us[Nas]
Got out the airport, the Mobb picked me up in the truck
Jewelry chunky like fuck, I ain't scared to get stuck
So what's the deal Papi, you heard the feds almost got me
I had the Cuban posse all up in my room and lobby
Negotiating like Illuminati, network
With catch a body experts, in retrospect to the foul connect
When I lost, but back then was my fault
Now it's time to floss, eye for a eye what's mine is yours
I need a suite with the flowers complimentary at Trump Towers
Sit at the table we can build for hours
On getting rich, it's a cinch, take a glimpse
"The World Is Yours" written all over the blimps
Here's a toast to my foes, it's like a whole new beginning
With Quaaludes and cream and loads of women rocking linen
I got a plan to blow to Hiroshima, Japan
Moving niggas out the hood and just divide it with fam
Ay yo the bitches, like Gee Money said to his man
'll ride the dick like a horse with the cowboy brand

[Hook]
Give it up fast, quick and not slow
Not going to the tables if it's not about dough
Son you know, Mobb Deep is running this shit
QBC, nigga rep your clique

[Havoc]
Yo son, I'm feeling it
Opposition want me dead, concealing shit
From gats got me living, kid, rushing through my pyramid
You secondary, go against the grain then you adversary
Had to bury niggas on my side that snitch
Ran his mouth like a bitch, now he's laying in the ditch
That he dug for himself, on his grave I had to piss
Scud missile, never miss you, hit you
Scratch you off my list, Gemstar rip through
Your mental, deeper, you ain't having it, me neither
It's drama, ain't got time for no breathers
Rapper Noyd make these niggas into believers

(Yo Noyd, what up with this cat right here, man? Word up)

[Big Noyd]
The tough guy screwing me? I guess he got plans to ruin me
He wanted to do me, slowly but surely I peeked his fast ass a bit early
Grabbed him by his wig, his shit was curly
(Put the chrome to his dome) let him know it's never early
You can slide, before I snatch the heat from his side
Saw the devil in despise by the look in his eyes
He was surprised how I snatched him up, regulated his gat
And backed him up, stepped to the side, P blast him up

[Prodigy]
Yeah yo, cannons erupt, you got strucked up abstrusely
Some rapper nigga playing thug tried to approach me
(Yo, kill that nigga
Man!)
All I remember was I shot for his throat
G
You see big guns in 3-D, it's haunting
It gets deep, fucking with these Chinese
Thai weed burning my hip from hot gats
Burning my lips from roach clips
Catch me on the 40th and Bootlegger, in the AM
These ante meridiem cats, insomniacs
Four in the morning we throwing back some Cognac juice
Letting gats loose, the blue van blitz through
These pissed two couldn't find the pistol
Ay yo, hopped out the Lexus, holding my necklace
I'm bent off some next shit, gasoline with a kerosene twist
Stumbling, placing my gun right, it's slipped down its calibre
Looking for chicks that he can stab now
Numbed up from my fiery cup of hell juice
Some singed nectar, Satan's fountain of youth
Mega action, bitches all around ready to fuck
Big asses, you raw-dogging shit, pressing your luck
My pipe game's like a night train, top speed through your womb-piece
Rated X to say the least

[Hook]
Give up the pussy fast, quick and not slow
Not going to the 'tel if it ain't a freak show
Son you know, Mobb Deep is running this shit
QBC, niggas rep they clique

Give it up fast, quick and not slow
Not going to the tables if it's not about dough
Son you know, Mobb Deep is running this shit
QBC, niggas rep they clique[Intro]
Whatever? Party's over tell the rest of the crew
Yo P, it's on you, what you wanna do?
*repeat x3*

[Verse 1: Prodigy]:
Every day of my life since 11-2-74
On the street makin non-stop CREAM galore
Packin heat, stickin up weed stores and more
Collectin interest off of extortions to settle my score
It gets deeper when things get real
I'm down to stickin out West Bank for my mill
And I'm from Hempstead, it's close to the shacks of Park South
While I'll be outside slingin, you're always high
And don't come around to the crossroads of life
We're to the death, you and me, this beef for eternity
I'm goin out to the fullest extent
So far into my troubles it's hard for me to get back
To my everyday self and composure
Catch you when you open then I bring you to a closure
Put ice on a razor and freeze ya in ya shoulder
I went for ya grill but you dent from my boulder
I know this kid who says he knows ya because of that
Now I know where ya lay ya hat at and that's that
Say no more, I put it on you while you was yawning
Murder without warning the very next morning

Once we step thru the door, party over, that's the endin
You and your crew'll leave out, a bunch of dead men
Bump me and I'll bump you back
You ain't tough black, niggas like you just get their life jacked
But I'mma cool nigga til you push me to the limit
But try ta play me and ya ass I get up all in it
Don't try to cop pleas now son, it's dead and done
(I gave you fair warning) So run and get your guns
It's on, time to show em how I perform
My attitude will transform, leave you dead plus wrong
Gettin the flow within, representin for Queens
Shit is real, why you hopin that it's all a dream
But you can't wake up, wettin a chest you bless
Chokin off your own blood, don't blame me you brought your own death

Chorus:

Aiyo Noyd, it's on you, what you wanna do?
Whatever? Party's over, tell the rest of the crew
Yo Big Noyd it's on you, what you wanna do?
Whatever? Party's over, tell the rest of the crew
Yo Big Noyd it's on you, what you wanna do?
Whatever? Party's over, tell the rest of the crew
Yo Big Noyd it's on you, what you wanna do?
Whatever? Party's over, tell the rest of the crew

[Verse 2: Big Noyd, Prodigy]
My beeper kept beepin, the other numbers started leakin
'Who is this on my mind?' I was thinkin
Then I realised it was my dun playin 911
Once I seen the numbers I ran for the fuckin guns
My dun in trouble, I be there on the double
I jumped up in the bubble, yo kid where are you?
(1-14 between Manhattan and Morningside Avenue)
This happened just right out the blue
Aiyo dun, fuck that bitch, tell her get off your dick
(But she's cryin and she says she has feelins and shit)
Yo it's a set-up, them niggas got me fed up
Ty stay in the buildin, if they move fuckin buck em
Get up off the scene, you know what I mean?
And hide yourself down with them other fuckin sixteen
Glock and get off they block
Then I hung up the cellular, ready to rock
And it's on

Yo, you get deaded in the streets, kid set it
You gots no credit, fool you get wetted
Up with the semi-auto Mac double, love it
'Did he shoot eleven or twelve?' is what he wondered
Nigga I got one more shot, you must be drinkin
Put the heater to his head, watch him start blinkin
'Am I goin to heaven or hell?' is what he's thinkin
Switch to a bitch as his life start sinkin
Down to a level of no return
Pull out the heat cos when the slugs hit it definitely burns
Now chill and think about your life for real
Every member of my crew is livin life for real
Got your self fucked into somethin that you couldn't finish
Up against the fulliest squad and get diminished
I'm from Q-U-E another E-N-S
So why you small tough talk? I'm not impressed
If I seen you in the Bridge, I'd make you undress
Give up the money, the polo especially the Guess

Chorus:

Big Noyd! Party's over, tell the rest of the crew
Havoc! Party's over, tell the rest of the crew
Black Ice! Party's over, tell the rest of the crew
Queensbridge! Party's over, tell the rest of the crew
The Big Twins! Party's over, tell the rest of the crew
Ty! Party's over, tell the rest of the crew
Yo Black! It's over, tell the rest of the crew

The motherfuckin party's over, tell the rest of the crew

Outro:

Get that nappy up
Yo get that nappy up
Son get that nappy up
Queens get that nappy up
Yo get that nappy up
*talkin to fade*[Havoc]
Sometimes it feels like the whole world is against me
But is it the Henny that bend me; I be in the zone
Gazing at the walls, deppressed, iggin' the phone
They take it personal, but only a minor few can understand
What a nigga feeling; 41st 'til I die motherfucka..(No doubt)
I'm still breathing. You a must son, we full bread
You ain't my dog, trying to infiltrate my clique is you
I get wit you, handle that on a later note
We o'er-dose every day the death is so close
I'm trying to tell these cats, but I let them do they thing..
Ready for the bad news 'til the phone ring
Son is dead, now I'm irate over my head seeking revenge son
Bent son on your behalf trying to laugh

[Prodigy]
Check out the drill-dun, conceal guns, play the hum
For real son's leaning back checking out the action
On the benches we drinkin X's
Yo twirl dat shit, while I spark this...
Chocolate burn it down like an arsonist
Pull out the miz cause its time to bring the biz to kidz
And blow all hell fire out ya empire
Your Livest wire couldn't make my mobb expire or retire
I'm letting off 'til my arms tired
You set quite wit my head full of riot
Our buyers, it clear for your ear to hear
I declared only live niggas rap this year
'96-I lost my dun; '97-It got worse.. fuck it
Somebody out the team, got to get merked..
And sat down you play the background when shots sound off
Flashbacks of how my man is gone, K.B. forever in my memory
I spill some Henny then I keep it moving

{Chorus}:
Yo, Do our thing, Hold it down, we got this, rockin' this
Ain't nobody stoppin this Rakim and Infamous
Rec the hood for you and yours-No doubt crash the bars
You don't really wanna go against the source

[Big Noyd]
Surprise open eyes, peep the foulness, the wildness
Its bug, niggas thugs in the projects you holiday thugs
Ease up all that illin' and grillin'
Get ya melon lit up, you niggas is butt
You want me, I'm right in QB, what?
Where you find me at sippin Congac from a cup
With my heat next to my nuts
Never afraid to pull it and bust
Slug rushin to your head like dust
But that wasn't enough this one was kind of tough he squeezed back better believe he no longer breath-black
Fuckin wit these Queens cats
I got dreams of raising my little queen and nobody gonna stop that
In fact black, if you come at me don't come sloppy
All my baby girl got is a papi to guide her
Through this world of hatred
And I die to see that she make it
And die to let the next man take it, is you stupid, UM...

[Rakim]
Yo, you wanna come test, son it's massive stress
Penalties of death, pay your last respects
We harass your rep if you slept or half step
We adapt to see what we can master next
After sex pass the bless for after effects
Relax through stress, do math and set, mad connects
Cash the check to get assets we blast techs
Dealing with the mental aspects in chess
So retreat your troops, if you Dunns come to shot
Get greeted by a twenty-one gun salute
I keep 'em leery of the deadly "7 MC" theory
Soon as they hear me, I release "Lyrics of Fury"
And quick to say a poem that ricochet in your dome
My clique made me leave the nickel-plated at home alone
So I can get the cheddar and be the better trend setter
The 18th Letter Forever, what

{Chorus 2X}[H] Yeah
[50] Yeah
[H] It's real, it's real
[50] Yeah
[H] Got 'em

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Bump that - niggas try to stunt on my clique
Then when I get on that shit, I bring it to 'em
Where they pump at, 12-gauge Mausberg
No shell in the head 'fore you put in work
You gotta pump that - you done hit a nigga with it
And you runnin, the police is comin, take my advice nigga
Dump that - this is serious, these rap niggas
I'm just havin fun with it, 50 Cent, Havoc bump that

[50 Cent]
My son asked, "Daddy why you carry a gun, you ain't a cop"
I looked at him and said, "Sometimes you gotta shoot or get shot
Wanna go to show-and-tell and show the class my Glock?
Show 'em the clip, show 'em the beam, show 'em how Daddy lean"
In the convertible Jag, 22-inch mags
For a high school dropout, shit, that ain't bad
I ain't a Blood or a Crip, I'm doin my own thang
G-UNIT! Shit, I done started my own gang
I don't go that funny dance, I don't throw gang signs
But I'm a gangsta to the core so I stay with a nine
You think all I do is rap, then you don't know me good
Have Smurf hangin out the sunroof to light up yo' hood
Man, Carlito ain't never seen Blanco comin
But if he did, you think he woulda started runnin?
And I move with them Doublemint Twins, and two macs
I'll leave you flat your back - BRRRAT! Take that

[Hook]

[Noyd]
Uh-huh, aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo
My life story is that gangsta thing, packin that thing
Iced out diamond rings; fuck linen
It's Timbs and jeans, puffin cigars, stuff it with greens
What's fuckin with Queens? Nuttin and not a thing
We kings of rap, shanks and gats, knuckles and bats
Get at me, you want beef, come correct
Stunt on any nigga in my clique-ah, you get clapped
We sick, so quick, you be layin on your back
Cause we don't give a fuck nigga, we love to dump
You don't wanna get jumped, better turn yo' music up
And bump that - cause we comin with them guns black
And cause of the hoodrats, know where your home's at
Fuck that, this is for my niggas in the hoods that
Slingin them blue caps, smokin that chronic sack
Get that paper, watch for all haters
Snitches and them bitches and them inside traders
Nigga fuck that

[Hook]

[Havoc]
Yeah, yeah
If you trippin with my niggas 50 and Noyd
If anybody ask me nigga them my homeboys
When it come to drama know we pack them big gats
(We got a ton of slugs) Bitch, and it's like that
We them thirsty ones, no mask, we stick cats
I never handcuff a ho, I let you whip that
Let my money bubble, live off the kick back
This midnight shit is serious, where your kids at?
These streets too dangerous to let them roam
I done seen the gulliest of 'em, cry for home
Like a fish out of water, they gasp and shake
I'm a friend of the jooks and the dukes and the duct tape
Like a Down South nigga I won't stop 'til I'm "skraight"
Walkin up the street, testin out my heat
Uh-huh.. and as you stand in disbelief
When it comes to the slugs I ain't cheap
Nigga you know I..

[Hook]5-7-75 my born day
I reach earth, now I'm involved in foul play
Ty Nitty
New York City
We stay right
The high life
Flooded ice from jewel heist
The Infamous Mobb with hood-like sense
Get up on a nigga quick
Hit 'em up with the ice pick
Strike quick
Leave ya body froze, sub-zero
Was taught to fear no
So I do so
Be All Pro
Flow international, rational
Matter of fact, I'm blastin' you
With the loaded weapon
No question
First suggestion
Pack ya shit, and head Western
Relocation
New state, new destination
Re-arrange your life
On the run from vice
Make you pray to Christ
Kid fucked up
My Mobb is rough
Nigga, what!
[Twin]
We true to be
Snake niggas for eternity
Mobb family
Murder thee
If it's meant to be
Trife casualty
Got the whole world after me
Catastrophe among us, fatal tragedy
Mafiosa, murder one mind
Black toaster, low composure
Twin Glocks in 2 holsters
We mobb vultures
Watch the fleet come closer
We tap down
Nowhere to run now
Don't back down
Muffled out my 4-pound
Silent sound
Bodies bloody on the ground
Chest full of 12 4-pound rounds
Nigga lay down, kid you assed out now
[Havoc]
No doubt, the infamous reppin' up in this
Know what I'm sayin'
Next up
[Prodigy]
Yeah yeah whatever kid, whatever kid
Yo, yo, the chronicles of a criminal cat who hold gat
And bust back at trash ass cats who scratch
Leave big holes like bitches with they legs spread hot
Ready for action now peep my whole block
Unveiled, and reveal hazardous skill
Trained assassins of this rap danger field
I feel y'all niggas ain't really keepin' it real
Use that ice grill like a shield
Nigga you meal, for my vultures
Swoop down attack your corpse
And found layin' in the streets of New York
Now sleepwalk
For that shit you did, shoulda never had did
Now you boxed in
Sentenced to a lifetime bid
Nigga Noyd and Pee, shine light like jewelry
Silver and gold exclusively
Terrorize and multiplee
Shot up your spot up
It just ain't what you used to be
After these fists of NY struck you D
Now you see a whole new life and new leaf
Searchin' for an exit tryin' to retreat the street
Wavin' white flags no days, you dead meat
We only truce when your heartbeat cease, peace
[Big Noyd]
Now who dare swear they can step up on these premises
Protected by a bunch of menaces
Rapper Noyd, the soloist
4-pound controloist
Comin' out the infamous controllin' the shit
Pistol packin' Pee on the side of me
Leap if you think sweet
Shit's deep, infamously
Now check the family
Prodigy, H-A-V-O-C, Ty Nitty, Godfather pt. 3, Gambino, Face, and
Gotti
So don't try me
Or better yet don't try this
My click specialty is vulturin'
Trained endangerin'
Packin' pipe games
Them heavy metal thing things
Ain't nuthin' changed
Karate Joe, Money No, make 'em fold
Gather up them hoes
Take 'em to the mo
Keep it on the low
You know the steelo, immediately
The VSOP is mandatory
It's all about hoes and clothes
The same story
Stackin' cheddar, packin' Berettas, keepin' it real
Fuck the sentimental feel
The Mobb movin' shit in reseal
Swiftly, smooth and quickly
The million dollar operation ran by the Mobb foundation
The nine pound we had it locked down
Kept 'em shook
Nine double trey's off da hook
The Mobb became famous from the lives that we took
Doin' jooks
So peep how the 4-pound sound it's off the motherfuckin' hook
Shit is real, plus exclusive and grimy
Rapper Noyd takin' over with the Mobb behind me

[Big Noyd (Havoc)]
Verbal kill, verbal kill, let me drop it like this (verbal kill)

My little thug's selling drugs and he's struggling
The game got him bugging, I tried to tell him slow down cousin
But he vexed and niggas getting lit up in the projects
But with no doubt, shorties out for his respect
But is his brain insane from the lye?
From smoking that 118 tiny tye
Why, a nigga just died last week
As he swore he was grown and he's a thug in the street
And it's like that, my crew pump cracks and we pack mac
His eyes is wild with the rezzy monkey on his back
But I'm stressed and I need to be blessed
With a firepack, and don't even go there cause it ain't like that
Slow down baby, he said, what, you trying to play me?
You didn't phase me, pulled out the heat and almost blazed me
Then he was Swayze, the shot must of dazed me
Thug selling drugs, busting slugs, but he ain't crazy

(Crowd Noise)[H] Yeah
[50] Yeah
[H] It's real, it's real
[50] Yeah
[H] Got 'em

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Bump that - niggas try to stunt on my clique
Then when I get on that shit, I bring it to 'em
Where they pump at, 12-gauge Mausberg
No shell in the head 'fore you put in work
You gotta pump that - you done hit a nigga with it
And you runnin, the police is comin, take my advice nigga
Dump that - this is serious, these rap niggas
I'm just havin fun with it, 50 Cent, Havoc bump that

[50 Cent]
My son asked, "Daddy why you carry a gun, you ain't a cop"
I looked at him and said, "Sometimes you gotta shoot or get shot
Wanna go to show-and-tell and show the class my Glock?
Show 'em the clip, show 'em the beam, show 'em how Daddy lean"
In the convertible Jag, 22-inch mags
For a high school dropout, shit, that ain't bad
I ain't a Blood or a Crip, I'm doin my own thang
G-UNIT! Shit, I done started my own gang
I don't go that funny dance, I don't throw gang signs
But I'm a gangsta to the core so I stay with a nine
You think all I do is rap, then you don't know me good
Have Smurf hangin out the sunroof to light up yo' hood
Man, Carlito ain't never seen Blanco comin
But if he did, you think he woulda started runnin?
And I move with them Doublemint Twins, and two macs
I'll leave you flat your back - BRRRAT! Take that

[Hook]

[Noyd]
Uh-huh, aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo
My life story is that gangsta thing, packin that thing
Iced out diamond rings; fuck linen
It's Timbs and jeans, puffin cigars, stuff it with greens
What's fuckin with Queens? Nuttin and not a thing
We kings of rap, shanks and gats, knuckles and bats
Get at me, you want beef, come correct
Stunt on any nigga in my clique-ah, you get clapped
We sick, so quick, you be layin on your back
Cause we don't give a fuck nigga, we love to dump
You don't wanna get jumped, better turn yo' music up
And bump that - cause we comin with them guns black
And cause of the hoodrats, know where your home's at
Fuck that, this is for my niggas in the hoods that
Slingin them blue caps, smokin that chronic sack
Get that paper, watch for all haters
Snitches and them bitches and them inside traders
Nigga fuck that

[Hook]

[Havoc]
Yeah, yeah
If you trippin with my niggas 50 and Noyd
If anybody ask me nigga them my homeboys
When it come to drama know we pack them big gats
(We got a ton of slugs) Bitch, and it's like that
We them thirsty ones, no mask, we stick cats
I never handcuff a ho, I let you whip that
Let my money bubble, live off the kick back
This midnight shit is serious, where your kids at?
These streets too dangerous to let them roam
I done seen the gulliest of 'em, cry for home
Like a fish out of water, they gasp and shake
I'm a friend of the jooks and the dukes and the duct tape
Like a Down South nigga I won't stop 'til I'm "skraight"
Walkin up the street, testin out my heat
Uh-huh.. and as you stand in disbelief
When it comes to the slugs I ain't cheap
Nigga you know I..

[Hook][Big Noyd]
Check it out yo, 'ey yo
They call me Big Noyd, the one that smack the taste out
Your fucking mouth, I keep it gutter that's what I be about
That's what I breathe, what I eat, that's what I shitted out
I'm from the streets and I'm a G and I know nothing else
Like when there's beef I grap a Tec from the fucking shelve
Stuff it in my jeans step on the scene, ruin your health
Snitches run their mouth, that's why I do it myself
No need to co, there's noone ratting me out
Just to find the guy, I keep it gully nigga ride out
Before my thuns come and air out your hide out
Matter fact say no more, your raw to grap your four
Your scared to call your dog, nigga let's get it on
I set it off, I start long blows
Knock your ass out and leave your dead with a bloody nose
Winking to your front door, who you know as raw as me
A skinny nigga, but up on the streets I'm a beast, motherfucker

[Hook: Big Noyd]
Yeah, yeah, this is how we do it man
We busting them chrome nines and running from one time
This is how we do it man
My mind on my money and my money on my mind, yep
This is how we do it man
We strap with them big gats, and chases some cool cat
This is how we do it man
We hold it down we don't fuck around niggas know our style, yep

[Masta Ace]
Hope I don't get shot today
Cause I heard some niggas letting off rounds, like a block away
It's like walking through Vietnam
Sorrounded by americans dressed like the Viet Cong
See that kid, 16, try to cop a gat
Ever since he was a brat he been a copy-cat
And he ain't scared to pull it blood
So I better watch my step or I might catch a bullet slug
See there's all kinds of rival stuff
We all in the line of fire nigga, and survival's tough
Send my son to the store, cause there's mold on the bread
They might send him home with a hole in the head
And just like 'Windex Cleaner'
It's clear that niggas settle problems with their index finger
And my moms has yet to strove
Cause she know that folks catches strays like pet control
These are dangerous times, the life's on the line
A nigga might get it by the knife or the nine
I gotta stay awake when I hold the cake
Cause the grim reaper looking for a soul to take
And the next cat may be him
So I look over my shoulder, when I'm standing at the ATM
Ya can go 'head and worry 'bout the crackers, fine
But that nigga with the nine, skin is black as mine

[Hook: Masta Ace]
This is how they do it man
Sawed-off shot, screaming give me what you got, nigga
This is how they do it man
Straight off blunt spillers and natural born killers
This is how they do it man
Chrome play the nine, put your life on the line, woaw
This is how they do it man
Holding down the block, the plot just won't stop, no[Big Noyd]
I'm the type of gentleman finessin timbalands
Flippin like three grand, cop a hundred grams goin hand and hand
Hennessee guzzlin, just motherfuckin hustlin
On the streets watchin police in the gray caprice
Six Y trey gate, time to motivate
Those are the dz that like to squeeze
If you flip you gettin hit with the four pound
Pull out your gat take out more rounds
3 against 1, thats how we go down
I can't get knocked, they tryin to get the drop, damn shit is hot
Im watchin what they doin cuz they cruisin up the next block
Im hot with this chrome piece, but I don't need the position
Where I'm spittin at the motherfuckin police
I couldn't get caught, had to leave New York, couldn't use my passport
Bitches hangin up in the airport
So yo bro, got to take the jetta
Whateva, I'm on the flow gotta get these ginos
Got a hundred grams of Coke bout to blow
Feel my cold pistol fully start spittin
I'm hittin and won't miss you
I'm official, Queensbridge murdera, life gambalin especially
Professionally gat handlin

And better than whoever wanna Front let em step up in

You best to believe the trigga squeeze, makin niggas bleed
Cross sea delivery, pushin keys out of factories
Baby you sound good, blowin up in the hood, its logical
Matter fact its possible, I got my work bubblin, me and my niggas jugglin
Cracks and strugglin while we hustlin but with no question

[Big Noyd]
A nigga try to bag me, he grabbed me, a nigga almost had me
I pulled out the banga and blew his ass badly, I'm nasty
Crazy mentality, start a catastrophe livin life tragedy
You know you gettin jumped punk
There ain't no time for more than one
Tellin em son
(They front, Smoke his ass like a Philly blunt)
Reach for my spine, pull out my nine, cock it one time
Make him lay down, dont move around cuz your ass mine
Gave a crook look got him shook, he on the floor flinchin
Now we bitchin and he snitchin, listen
I pistol whipped him, but to know the main fact
Is that I pushed his wig back then took off in the black AC'

Hook

[Big Noyd]
Motherfucker, word up[Nas]
Got out the airport, the Mobb picked me up in the truck
Jewelry chunky like fuck, I ain't scared to get stuck
So what's the deal Papi, you heard the feds almost got me
I had the Cuban posse all up in my room and lobby
Negotiating like Illuminati, network
With catch a body experts, in retrospect to the foul connect
When I lost, but back then was my fault
Now it's time to floss, eye for a eye what's mine is yours
I need a suite with the flowers complimentary at Trump Towers
Sit at the table we can build for hours
On getting rich, it's a cinch, take a glimpse
"The World Is Yours" written all over the blimps
Here's a toast to my foes, it's like a whole new beginning
With Quaaludes and cream and loads of women rocking linen
I got a plan to blow to Hiroshima, Japan
Moving niggas out the hood and just divide it with fam
Ay yo the bitches, like Gee Money said to his man
'll ride the dick like a horse with the cowboy brand

[Hook]
Give it up fast, quick and not slow
Not going to the tables if it's not about dough
Son you know, Mobb Deep is running this shit
QBC, nigga rep your clique

[Havoc]
Yo son, I'm feeling it
Opposition want me dead, concealing shit
From gats got me living, kid, rushing through my pyramid
You secondary, go against the grain then you adversary
Had to bury niggas on my side that snitch
Ran his mouth like a bitch, now he's laying in the ditch
That he dug for himself, on his grave I had to piss
Scud missile, never miss you, hit you
Scratch you off my list, Gemstar rip through
Your mental, deeper, you ain't having it, me neither
It's drama, ain't got time for no breathers
Rapper Noyd make these niggas into believers

(Yo Noyd, what up with this cat right here, man? Word up)

[Big Noyd]
The tough guy screwing me? I guess he got plans to ruin me
He wanted to do me, slowly but surely I peeked his fast ass a bit early
Grabbed him by his wig, his shit was curly
(Put the chrome to his dome) let him know it's never early
You can slide, before I snatch the heat from his side
Saw the devil in despise by the look in his eyes
He was surprised how I snatched him up, regulated his gat
And backed him up, stepped to the side, P blast him up

[Prodigy]
Yeah yo, cannons erupt, you got strucked up abstrusely
Some rapper nigga playing thug tried to approach me
(Yo, kill that nigga
Man!)
All I remember was I shot for his throat
G
You see big guns in 3-D, it's haunting
It gets deep, fucking with these Chinese
Thai weed burning my hip from hot gats
Burning my lips from roach clips
Catch me on the 40th and Bootlegger, in the AM
These ante meridiem cats, insomniacs
Four in the morning we throwing back some Cognac juice
Letting gats loose, the blue van blitz through
These pissed two couldn't find the pistol
Ay yo, hopped out the Lexus, holding my necklace
I'm bent off some next shit, gasoline with a kerosene twist
Stumbling, placing my gun right, it's slipped down its calibre
Looking for chicks that he can stab now
Numbed up from my fiery cup of hell juice
Some singed nectar, Satan's fountain of youth
Mega action, bitches all around ready to fuck
Big asses, you raw-dogging shit, pressing your luck
My pipe game's like a night train, top speed through your womb-piece
Rated X to say the least

[Hook]
Give up the pussy fast, quick and not slow
Not going to the 'tel if it ain't a freak show
Son you know, Mobb Deep is running this shit
QBC, niggas rep they clique

Give it up fast, quick and not slow
Not going to the tables if it's not about dough
Son you know, Mobb Deep is running this shit
QBC, niggas rep they clique[Verse 1: Prodigy]
Ayo, Queens get the Money long time no cash
I'm caught up in the hustle when the guns go blast
The fool retaliated so I had to think fast
Pull out my heat first, he pull out his heat last
Now who the fuck you think is living to this day?
I'm tryna tell these young niggas crime don't pay
They looked at me and said "Queen's niggas don't play
Do your thing, I'll do mine kid stay outta my way"
It's type hard tryna survive in New York state
Can't stop 'til I'm eating off a platinum plate
Po po comes around and tries to relocate me
Lock me up forever but they can't deflate me
Cause having cash is highly addictive
Especially when you're used to having money to live with
I thought step back look at my life as a whole
Ain't no love it seems the devil done stole my soul
I'm out for delfia, selfia, P's not helping ya
I'm tryna get this Lexus up, and plus a cellular
Yo, Big Noyd! (What up cousin?) I can't cope
With all these crab niggas tryna shorten my rope

[Verse 2: Big Noyd]
Yo, it's the R-A-double-P-E-R
N-O-Y-D, niggas can't fuck with me
Coming straight outta QB, pushing an Infiniti
You ask can I rip it constantly? Mentally?
Definitely, to the death of me, come and test me
Trust me, nigga couldn't touch me if he snuff me
So bust me, you're gonna have to, cause I'mma blast you
My lyrical like a miracle, ill spiritual
I'm born with it, I'm getting on with it
And I'mma have it 'til I'm fucking dead and gone with it
Cause I'm a what? Composer of hardcore, a lyrical destructor
Don't make me buck ya, cause I'm a wild mothafucka
You know my flow, you know my steelo
Even pack my gat when I go to see my PO
Jump out my hooptie, pass my gat and my lucci
To my shorty in case my PO try to troop me
To the island, and if I start wildin
Flipping on niggas walking around with the nice gold medallions
But she didn't violate me, so I escaped see
Back to Queen's pumping the fiends making more CREAM
Know what I mean? I'm a natural born hustler
Won't try to cut ya, pull out my 4 4 and bust ya

[Verse 3: Havoc]
Hey Yo, ain't no time for faking jacks cause brothers who fake jacks
Get laid on their backs, the streets is real
Can't roll without steel, I feel how I feel
Cause I was born to kill, do what I gotta
To eat a decent meal, brothers is starving
Don't try to find a job son, it's all about robbing
So don't be alarmed when we come through
We supposed to, if you opposed to, get your face blown dude
Off the map, cause I react, attack
A brother wasn't blessed with wealth, so I act like that
Drug dealing, only mess with shorties thats appealin
I'm fronting on the world once I start 4-wheeling
Cause back on the 41st Side, we do a ride
Sipping E&J, getting bent all night
Yo, who that? I never seen him in my whole life, step to his business
Cause it's only right, po-po ain't around so I grab my pound
Money retaliated so I hit the ground, my life is on the line
Gotta hold my projects down, can't see myself getting bodied
By a clown.....ass nigga that ain't even from my town
Hit him up in the chest and now he's laying me down dead
And up from under the benches I started hearing sirens
I stop firing, to cut ass like a diamond, jetted to the cribpiece
What a relief, stashed the heat then proceeded to peep
Out the window, call my son, "yo son we got beef
But no question, money had a problem so I solved him"

[Verse 4: Prodigy]
I got my mind on the stick-up, now it's time to get paid
Thinking of ways to take loot already made
There's crime in the air, ain't no time to be afraid
Give me yours and get laid, give up the goods and get sprayed
I got lots of love, for my crew that is
No love for them other crews and rival kids
All them out-of-town niggas know what time it is
And if they don't, they need to buy a watch, word up
Caught up in the cross-fire get theyself hurt up
While I be sipping gin straight in a plastic cup
On a park bench on 12th Street, my whole crew's famous
You tried to bust your gat and keep it real but you nameless
First of all slow down, you on the wrong route
Let me put you on your feet and show you what's it all about
The street life ain't nothing to play with
No jokes no games kid for years I been doing the same shit
Just drinking liquor, doing bids, extorting crack heads
And sticking up the stick-up kidsYeah, kill 'em, how we do it dun
Get your gunz nigga, we killing 'em

Drama we into, and bring it to you physical

Gunz ain't a thang duke
You know what them thangs do
Swing and lay whole crew

Let nigga front, blow his top off

Every piece of bullet, every chunk of flesh they lose
You knew the rules, you knew what you was getting into
You touch me, so its mandatory that I hit you

Criminal minds, pack nines when they rock

If your gunz pop nigga, my gun pop
Do the maths, somebody ass gonn be up in a box
Its not me, no days, no nights
And you, no more rocking your wear
Guccis with your Nikes

[Prodigy]
True, no more fronting like you larger than life
Nigga I'll terminate your days, cancel your nights
It's not a problem, holla at my dawgs
Show you how to work them guns
Fuck a spare clip, we got extra drums

Nah, faggot ass nigga
Clap 'em down, clap 'em down, clap'em down son[Havoc]
Sometimes it feels like the whole world is against me
But is it the Henny that bend me; I be in the zone
Gazing at the walls, deppressed, iggin' the phone
They take it personal, but only a minor few can understand
What a nigga feeling; 41st 'til I die motherfucka..(No doubt)
I'm still breathing. You a must son, we full bread
You ain't my dog, trying to infiltrate my clique is you
I get wit you, handle that on a later note
We o'er-dose every day the death is so close
I'm trying to tell these cats, but I let them do they thing..
Ready for the bad news 'til the phone ring
Son is dead, now I'm irate over my head seeking revenge son
Bent son on your behalf trying to laugh

[Prodigy]
Check out the drill-dun, conceal guns, play the hum
For real son's leaning back checking out the action
On the benches we drinkin X's
Yo twirl dat shit, while I spark this...
Chocolate burn it down like an arsonist
Pull out the miz cause its time to bring the biz to kidz
And blow all hell fire out ya empire
Your Livest wire couldn't make my mobb expire or retire
I'm letting off 'til my arms tired
You set quite wit my head full of riot
Our buyers, it clear for your ear to hear
I declared only live niggas rap this year
'96-I lost my dun; '97-It got worse.. fuck it
Somebody out the team, got to get merked..
And sat down you play the background when shots sound off
Flashbacks of how my man is gone, K.B. forever in my memory
I spill some Henny then I keep it moving

{Chorus}:
Yo, Do our thing, Hold it down, we got this, rockin' this
Ain't nobody stoppin this Rakim and Infamous
Rec the hood for you and yours-No doubt crash the bars
You don't really wanna go against the source

[Big Noyd]
Surprise open eyes, peep the foulness, the wildness
Its bug, niggas thugs in the projects you holiday thugs
Ease up all that illin' and grillin'
Get ya melon lit up, you niggas is butt
You want me, I'm right in QB, what?
Where you find me at sippin Congac from a cup
With my heat next to my nuts
Never afraid to pull it and bust
Slug rushin to your head like dust
But that wasn't enough this one was kind of tough he squeezed back better believe he no longer breath-black
Fuckin wit these Queens cats
I got dreams of raising my little queen and nobody gonna stop that
In fact black, if you come at me don't come sloppy
All my baby girl got is a papi to guide her
Through this world of hatred
And I die to see that she make it
And die to let the next man take it, is you stupid, UM...

[Rakim]
Yo, you wanna come test, son it's massive stress
Penalties of death, pay your last respects
We harass your rep if you slept or half step
We adapt to see what we can master next
After sex pass the bless for after effects
Relax through stress, do math and set, mad connects
Cash the check to get assets we blast techs
Dealing with the mental aspects in chess
So retreat your troops, if you Dunns come to shot
Get greeted by a twenty-one gun salute
I keep 'em leery of the deadly "7 MC" theory
Soon as they hear me, I release "Lyrics of Fury"
And quick to say a poem that ricochet in your dome
My clique made me leave the nickel-plated at home alone
So I can get the cheddar and be the better trend setter
The 18th Letter Forever, what

I'm representin', you know I'm representing kid check me
Got to pack the gat when the beef is getting heavy
I'm going all out
You know moves I never fake
But every time I blink at night all I see is snakes
And I'm alone
Trapped in this trife life zone
But Fuck it, y'know I'm turning snakes to stones
You say to ya man that I'm pussy but you wonder
You stupid
I'm putting niggas 6ft under
So check my style go deep into foul
I was catching rats with the tecks since Juvenile
Listen, cut your conversation 'til I'm finished
I'm about to give the definitions to the rhymes I'm kicking
Real reality, life is just a tradegy kid
Don't get mad at me
'Cus that's the way ya had to be
Struggling Striving
Asking why my peoples dying
Its too late to ask shawty, who got hit with the iron gat
All up in his back
Like my man P said it's that unknown fact
But it's like that
The drama get iller than in the projects
Catch a rat with the what what (nigga what it [?])
Guns are blasting, bodies dropping to the floor faster
Than years are passing and I'm gasping for air I swear
'94 kick it raw. The BIG NOYD kick it hardcore
Escalate, elevate my rhymes doing another level
Huh, Im I share my feelings with the devil
(Im feeling!) No you got me dreaming
Like Christopher Williams a [?]

[Verse 2: Havoc]
Ayo it's the hard times that got me generating hard rhymes
I'm confined to the projects running from one time
Confide in my peoples they confide in me
'Cus if It's alright with them if it's all right with me
So we be, upstairs at the tables planning
Thinking of ways we can make this happen
On this planet, I'm struggling
Wanna be hustling
So I'm ready to face any kind of repercussion
If its Jail or death, crippled up or broke
The only thing I'm thinking is slinging that Coke
To get on son, hitting niggas off for packs
Only niggas from my block 'cus we get down like that
As I combat the snakes and rats, watch my back
Don't wanna be the one caught swallowing cracks
Looking reazy, before it goes down I be ready on point
Jump on my bike and get deady
It's a family thing. I got love for my crew
Pour some beer for the niggas that ain't here (True)
Yeah my man Richie Lou, rest in Peace
To my man Poochy you know we still love you
My man Loui
Lloyd, WeeWop, and all of that

[Verse 3: Prodigy]
Don't ask why It's just like that. I was brought up to live the wrong way
At night to God I pray
Will he let me breathe another 24 hours of air?
I really don't deserve it
But really I don't care
From what I see, whatever is, it's meant to be
So untill I drop, its the crime life for me
Some say I need help, because the way i'm living's sick
I reply mind for own, 'fore you be another vict'
Many years of corruption, what will I end up with?
Nothing but a pocket of memories of foul shit committed as a youngster
Grand larcenist/petty thief
Yo imma make this brief
In my early years, I was living fouler than most
Smile all up in your face take your money and get ghost
Shit ain't right
And I might regret it later that night
While I be laying in bed holding my thoughts tight
Waking up early in the me-our
Do my thing correct so it don't lead to the p now
'Cus fuck that shit, I'll rather roam the streets freely
Plan a box to get
Send you home hurt, crying, broke feeling upset
Don't take it personal, I'm only tryna live
Tonight we taking donations so what you got to give?
The dirt underneath my fingernails got a story to tell of they own
All things is shown, ain't nothing to hide. I speak the raw truth
Uncut
Rewind my whole verse if there is anything you overlooked
'Cus I don't got time for your bullshit talk
'cus niggas getting murdered in the streets of New York
So at the same time, I'm outside taking mine
I'm taking yours
'til I hit the figures in the fours..

[Outro]
Yeah Uh huh
I wanna give a shout out to my man up north
My man Stowbo (Yeah) hold your head baby
Be home in a little while
No Doubt
I wanna give a shoutout to all the brothers thats doing it real
Ya know what Im saying
Word up
Peace out to my man T there up north
Representing to the fullest
Mobb Deep in the house (yeah)

[Prodigy]
Yeah old school part one feel it
The realest, Who be the realest
Them niggas stay
Infamous minded
U've been blinded
Cut on your face
Fucking with these mobb giants
They are the victims
We be the victors
Sometime a nigga gotta step up
And bring war, Spray ks
And go out in a blaze
Young guns learn to duck
So they won't catch strays
Won't shoot to be frontin'
Or to waste shots for nothin
If I'm pulling out my torch
Im gonn hit somethin', Whatever
Slugs through your avirex leather
I close one lid
So I could aim a little better
I stop firing
And  de-cock the hammer
You need triads
I need to get up outta here
Dont really think It's cool to let another man
[Havoc]
"Let me buck that nigga son"
[Prodigy]
I hold my own cannon and shoot just as fast
Move with select few
Dont fuck with lil dude
Or little pistols
Strictly the big Ru's
Cause deuce-deuce its only good for hiding
I need big firepower when I'm riding
52 shot clips
You pop lips, Silence
And i dont stop dumping till i hear sirens
I'm not a boyz n the hood addict
Menace fanatic
I live the street life for real
So i can brag it
Pop gave me gun lesson back when i was a kid
Now i fire more arms than he ever did
Thats why
I keep things in proper prospective
And every album point y'all niggas in the right direction
There's  no protection, when I'm on the mike
You couldn't fold me
If you trained all your life
You's a chump, I'm a champ
You broke, I'm top dollar
Niggas gotta whole lotta mouth
Thats no problem
Fake thugs lay down
Real killers dont yell it
Bring it don't sing it nigga
Use intelligence
Its evident you not, murder material
When you all alone, you pose guns in the mirror yo
Chinky, Rapper Noyd, Hav, G part 3, my nigga Bino and Nitty
Y'all feel me
Let me get deeper in the subject
Cause its gets me hard
Every nigga holding
Dont mean he gonn arc
Any nigga that show it
Need to disown it
Or get it tooken by another who deserve it
Listen, this is what it takes to survive today
Use your eyes, to my niggas thats ride with me
And you see that nigga P, be the storm quiet
Im holding, so ease back
I stay infamous minded
[Noyd]
Yeah yeah nigga, shit is real
You know
[Prodigy]

When the bridge start rocking
My niggas keep popping
[Repeat Hook til fade][Hook]
At the end of the road turn right
After 80 meters turn right
Then take the second left
Go right on the roundabout first exit
Turn around when possible

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
Yo listen, they wanna set me up, uh huh, grab me up
They can’t take it how i make it, stay being bucked
Truth be told, they beneath me, let’s be honest
Cause I be switching up the scenery like from the projects
To the Kremlin, the Hong Kong skyline
He’ll never get a turn, it’s always my time
Find another skill, hip hop is mine
The only reason you rap is cause you heard my rhymes
You wasting good drug money on studio time
You better off buying clothes, get fresh, right
You suck, turn that bullshit off
You ain’t got no Mobb Deep in your iPod
You ain’t got no Don P, your whole life wrong
This the best of the best, turn the lights on
You need to see what the fuck is going on
I’m the main event,  the great wizard of bars

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Havoc]
I’ve been riding down that road for a minute
Speeding in and out of lanes pushing it to the limit
But the journey’s not finished
Part away from P to handle my own business
I met a fork in the road
Which way to go? I’m all for the dough
It’s money over hoes, bullet for the skull
Fucked up when you gotta put your dreams on hold
And your homies don’t see the bigger picture like you do
Trying to navigate to a city that I outgrew
Fuck the world ‘cause they doubt you
Hear your enemies, but watch them niggas that’s around you
100 MPH, getting closer to the exit
Heard you took it off cause I’m on to some next shit
Am I headed in the right direction?
Only God knows, but I count my blessings

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Noyd]
I got the pedal to the metal doing about a 100
Jake in the rearview, sirens going
Red and blues flashing, life is on high speed
Only thing that slow me down this blunt and some good trees
But it’s hotter than a pancake
That’s life’s struggle, it is what you make it
But me I’m about the paper like a ticket
It’s all about the dough, fuck the speed limit
Stacking change, stay in your lane
Don’t rub a neck, keep your eyes on your own thing
Check your blind spot before you make moves
Whether left or right, nigga, watch what you do
Cause a wreck could happen in a sec
Pushing it too hard, you end up in treeyards
See me, I stay strapped like a safe-belt
He tucked under the seat, that’s how we roll

[Hook]

[Outro]
After 100 meters, make a U-turn
Then at the end of the road, Turn right
After 200 meters - sharp left
Then, you have reached your destination
You have reached your destination[Intro: Prodigy and Big Noyd]
That's my word, God! Kick that thug shit, God
Kick that motherfuckin thug shit, man! Word up, man
(What's up, son? What's up?) Word up, get go
(No doubt, nigga!) Money no represent, knowI'msayin?
(All the time, baby) No doubt (YouknowI'msayin?)
Who we got here, son? (Shine, baby, shine)
(Look) Look who we have here, yo! (up in the sky...sky)

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
Here come the vultures, the Mobb-laced potent rap shit
Perhaps, kid, make it happen, start the flipping
You fucking comic, who you kidding?
My nigga's laughing, blood bathin, the world's greatest
In-famous crime-zanous
To interfere would be dangerous
Plane descent, stand clear, save your strength
You couldn't go the length if you was coked up  
By my z'd up, whatever the fuck, who gives a fuck? You get fucked
My coalition specializes in collision
The clash of the cliques, the duel o' the iron MAC, spit
And leave ya half-split
You'll be missin much more than a fraction
When it's time for action
Hit em while a man down, make that nigga backspin
Trapped up, a ???? madman
We're blasting, you're collapsing heavily like my gold MAC-10
Get imprisoned with them raps they have you relapsing
You get casting the Mobb, deaf and assin
We face splashing, dope fake's ice-pick stabbing
He slow leakin, he 'ternally bleedin for speakin
Outta place, niggas get placed back indecent
Live at the main event may I present
Screamin out loud for any squad that's deaf
My Infamous Mobb, ya heart throb, hold ya breath
It's KO from dead arm rights and hard lefts
Another satisfied consumer who got blessed
Single out ya army til there's no man left

[Hook]
Man down (man down, down, down, down) (x3)
Lay the fuck down!

[Verse 2: Havoc]
Infamous cartel, visible evidence
We scarred well, associated team benevolent
Never hesitant, opposition get settled here with
Sharp shit that'll rip through
One hundred layers of Kevlar, sharp like the GemStar
Exiled, son, he get sent far
He's the foulest, QBC gat bust the loudest
Below profile, peep style, thirsty prowlest
Catching court cases, pay for your legal aid
Son, that's money wasted, I ain't got time for that
Invest third place on my best sold rap
On the scrap from the ignorant cats
It'll be dead in a few....just like that
Couldn't bust his gat right (Yo, y'know what?)
But now you bucked your own man, amateur ass
Homeboy take that ass to class
But you cut in, ducking a reality blast
You catch a D minus fucking with New York's finest
The conversation from them outsiders
Dick riders, connivers bomb ya camp
We know survivors, push you off guard, got homiciding
We analyzing, tell you up front ain't no surprises
We take you down first round, give ya man pound

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Noyd]
Check it out dun, them niggas ain't ones
To be blowin' off the top and shit, I'm tired of shit
Dun, I'm about to dot the bitch and leave him stiff
Toss me the fif' so I can bless the G.O.D. with gift
Yo nigga Noyd, what's the topic? Yo, the topic is this
Let me start from the beginning at the top of the list
First of all them tight niggas with that space-down shit
I stick a rocket up in they ass and give em a lift
My marvelous Mobb is tonic, intoxicant, bee-swee
Morphine raps, you get dope from inner mind-see
Shit fiending, now get your fix cause you need it
Fucking up your intravenous, the Infamous Mobb top secret
The only way you weaking is if you beaking this
Sneak devy niggas mischievous
Knowledging the G.O.D. behind the scene on some snake shit
The vultures, water from their mouth but we can taste it
We just waiting with patience
Yo, dun, check the cross-examination these niggas faking
So you can scream, you can fiend, you can dream for the bacon
Or you can snatch the Mac for the faggot, ai
Bang em up, fuck em up

[Hook]

Lay the fuck down, down, down, down...[Verse 1: Big Noyd]
Yeah, yeah
You know Queens is in the building
But niggas be chillin’ at the round table building
The robberies and killers, man
They ran up in the spot
Knew the Glock was in the ceiling
Sad niggas in the hood, get down for the millions
They bust gats, some rap, some be dealing
But watch out for them thugs, you don’t wanna fuck with em
’cause niggas real grimy, you have to fucking kill em
They living like life just wiped his ass with em
Just niggas strung out, have your gun out when you see em
That do money hungry, you wouldn't wanna be em
You stick it for 500 and flip it to a G
Put dope in the bags and sell it in the streets
You known as a hustler, watch it, he a cut ya
Dig in your pockets, turn around and gun but ya
Money game when your grain is street hustler
Yeah, bad motherfucker
I’m a naturally born hustler
We don’t get caught up in between

[Hook]
Boss, got a hustler to hustler
Some hustlers naturally born with street smarts
I’m a naturally born hustler
I’m a queen stand represent to the fullest
Boss, got a hustler to hustler
Some hustlers naturally born with street smarts

[Verse 2: Large Professor]
Bangin’ on them past, hangin on them ass, ringing on that ass
Rip hard the street slash my professional
Yeah we still sparing in them vestibules, beating niggas
Leavin them like garden investitures
Tryin to stay up while everybody doing bad
Make a little lag, get low down like both stags
It’s too many brothers
Walk around get smothered for the every day word
Play game out the skeleton, lots of cash underneath lots of ash
Where our forefathers used to flame box and flash
For the cameras, light bar vila with the hammers
Too much beef, forget the motherfucking sandwich
From both finish with no folks and no friends
The pain of having chocking about you more trends
Well I maintain on them blocks with oceans of love
Lost four still keeping it rob, get that money thunn

{Hook]

[Verse 3: Kool G. Rap]
I'm from NY where them niggas get that money
Call me the ventriloquist the way I talk with the dummy
Dummy, he ain’t running no side show at
Think is a game, till I buck one in your chest
And make your eyes go back
Repping Corona queens north of boulevard
You can let your chrome scream or you can get bullet scarred
You’re like just stay here, is nothing to pull the job
’cause niggas know the shit, come out that map fully hard
But not far very take notice, you notice and learn to focus your harm
Niggas watching what time, niggas only rely, no harder desamble
Real dirty with it, niggas who leave your ass for somebody to find you
Here you get no weber on the front it
You even hustle enough the.., the man is shaking down something
..shake body way on the way down something
For real telling you boy you’d better move at the function

[Hook x 2][Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
(YAOWA)
A night in my Ps
Three fiends teamin' up to get one hit
Little dude on the roof tryin' test how his gun spit
Hennessy cups spillin' wildin' out to Big Pun shit
Dice game in the lobby, homey bank is a hundred
Shorty keep walkin' by wanna suck on my son dick
It's sad (why) that's word to me this ho is a young bitch
Cops ridin' slow if they hop out we run quick
Slam a door in they face and just laugh at them dumb pricks
Haze in the air, the smell stays in your hair
Hustlers on the strip wearin' yesterdays gear
Dressed in all black on a bike, he's a robber
Hood rats with they seed pointin', like he's your father
Undercover druggies tryin' to sneak a cop
Man get the fuck outta here man, that shit Meeka pops?
I just thought he smoked weed a lot
Dog be careful where your v is parked
That nigga there'll sneak thieve your drop
Son on the court tryin' to work on his jump shot
It's funny this is all on one block
Jamal and them locked, the cab had they face on cam, dirty
I know they sick doin' a bid for a buck thirty
You see that nigga right there? Yeah with the Bucs jersey
I got word on the low that son bucked Percy
These surroundings make it hard for yall to un-earth me
I shall remain Ortiz, this is a night in my Ps, nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big Noyd]
They say where I'm from, stars are born
The bloods is strong, and uh
Crips is thick, the guns is long
And my P's are sick, it's outta control nigga
The block is hot, the guns explode
And the hood is psycho, you already know
They leave holes in your Girbauds
When it come to that dough
Cuz its all about that money, murder, and ho's
Yo here's an example when a nigger come home
First he, come out the slammer
Then he, pull up with bama?
Then he cock the hammers, and the drama is on
Won't be long for you know that niggas gone, doing bids
Leavin his bitch with another kid
It is what it is
I love the hood, grimy as shit
Down to the rocks I chop and  chicks that I rip
Runnin from the d's, makin cheese, puffin piff
To that whip I pimp and the yak that I sip
If you a G from the p's then you fuckin with this
Keep a bitch on her knees, and a gun on her hip
With 1 and a half and 16 in the clip
And every nigga who spit rep the hood they with
I'm reppin QB nigga, you know what it is
M.O.B. motherfucka, we reppin' the bridge
And wherever your hood is, throw it up kid
Get that guap and don't stop, handle your biz

[Hook][Produced By Havoc]

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
You can never understand the mind state
My goal is to increase the crime rate
And work at a fast pace, no time to think twice
Catch the full blinking and he will be ice
You're trying to play tough on the menu
But I can see the trick within you
I break it down to a science, word is bond
Nine times out of ten says you'll never see your life again
I'm ready to die, and ready for all y'all
If you think you ready to try
And push the G.O.D to the limit
But I ambush and hit hard and bust shots in it
You didn't really want to get involved with a gunfight
Praying to God that you could live a long life
But I put the knife to your throat and proceed to cut
While you're bleeding on the floor with your mouth shut
And what?

[Hook]
(Coming at you) All we do all day is
All we do all day
All we do all day is
All we do all day

[Verse 2: Havoc]
Step through the door
You can't step to ninety four
With the mind of Saddam, hardcore, bringing war
So cock your pistol
A mac can rip like a Scud missile
I'll leave a cop killer lost in your brain tissue
Therefore, say no more, I'm the raw
Kid with skills, give you more than what you came for
My crew got my back so when you pop
This Glock kicks hollow tips, hitting you up real quick
I chill on the ill, mind my own, but still
Stay your point, keep my steel cocked and ready for real
I stay trife, and walk the projects at night
Living right? Son, they want to take my life!
I'm paranoid, damn sure ain't the weed I smoke
It's the phony other brothers, while I'm on, they're broke
I see 'em staring, with their heat to try to get bold
Staring at my gold, so they eat a whole [?] like a mic
When a rhyme commit crimes tonight
Threw a bid on my head? Pump lead
Leave your whole town red, bust a vessel instead
I choose, you lose when I squeeze
The enemies, them blow to fumes
Spark a L, burn a brain cell, love love
Ay black Paddyshop, light it up

[Bridge: Big Noyd]
Big Noyd in the house, representing Mobb Deep
Either smoking a black, or the bluey one-twoey
Light it up, light the weed and make a cloud (x4)

[Verse 3: Prodigy]
You got a lot of heart boy, all that yapping
Acting like it can’t happen
It’s brothers like you who fail to realize the realness
So now I got to deal with this
Back when I was younger, I used to get stuck
But now the tables turned and I make the beef duck
Quit stealing all you who want to try and play me
I bet you if I hit you with the pound you’d obey me
You must be smoking dust, my crew will flip for days
And bust your face open in various ways
I’m in too deep, ain't no if, what if, maybes
And if you got a kid then the P is killing babies
And after that, relax and get puffed out
But watch your step cause you could still get rubbed out
Stop fronting, get a Tec to your grill
For real, you ain’t ill, I know the deal
Puff a fat L, burn a brain cell, love love
Ay black Paddyshop, lighting it up

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Havoc]
I leave your brain in your face, [call?] [?] dead to mine
Can’t find out project south, that’s when I climb out
Be on a flow in the Ac flip-two ego one two
Ay Black, that’s where they got that stay high
Keep my mind in the sky, straight are the corrupt
Front on this kid and you get bucked
Left stuck off the raps I kick, Queensbridge kid, you dig?
And rocks into the head, take a swig
I’m bent, stay hard
And if we bump into any shorties all I want to know is if there’s any skins to barb
I live the high life, keep my mind right, do my dirt tonight
Forget the pull, word is bond, it’s on
Queensbridge, representing with the automatic fullies
Weapons we pack, more cracks and flip G-packs
Get that loot kid, what you gonna do when my whole crew is blazing at you?
’Cause it’s whole crews we run through
I'm ill like Tommy Hill but brothers can’t figure the facts
Fake Jacks, you’ll get ten in your back
I react like a maniac, strapped with macs
It’s what the petty tip you on cause I'm not on it like that
I just chill, what the Hell? Everybody want to be a gangster
Step to Havoc, and step into the Zone of Danger
They get blown with the banger
You been on a whore too long, a buck fifty flippin' on me
Cause everywhere I go son, it’s time for me to flip
Loose licks ain’t shit, aim a nine and don’t miss
I learned to hold my own, protect my dome from beef
I’m quick to squeeze my piece, when the beef get deep
I get down for my crown in a minute
Want some drama, want some gun? Imma end it!
And all this time, I been smoking Drum, to relax my mind
I’m stressed like a motherfucker, niggas get bucked
On the ave, cause Queens niggas don’t give a fuck
And if you didn’t know by now, Queensbridge is where I’m from
The place that stars are born and phony rappers get done
Spark an L, burn a brain cell, love love
Ay black Paddyshop, lighting it up

[Hook][Intro]
Whatever? Party's over tell the rest of the crew
Yo P, it's on you, what you wanna do?
*repeat x3*

[Verse 1: Prodigy]:
Every day of my life since 11-2-74
On the street makin non-stop CREAM galore
Packin heat, stickin up weed stores and more
Collectin interest off of extortions to settle my score
It gets deeper when things get real
I'm down to stickin out West Bank for my mill
And I'm from Hempstead, it's close to the shacks of Park South
While I'll be outside slingin, you're always high
And don't come around to the crossroads of life
We're to the death, you and me, this beef for eternity
I'm goin out to the fullest extent
So far into my troubles it's hard for me to get back
To my everyday self and composure
Catch you when you open then I bring you to a closure
Put ice on a razor and freeze ya in ya shoulder
I went for ya grill but you dent from my boulder
I know this kid who says he knows ya because of that
Now I know where ya lay ya hat at and that's that
Say no more, I put it on you while you was yawning
Murder without warning the very next morning

Once we step thru the door, party over, that's the endin
You and your crew'll leave out, a bunch of dead men
Bump me and I'll bump you back
You ain't tough black, niggas like you just get their life jacked
But I'mma cool nigga til you push me to the limit
But try ta play me and ya ass I get up all in it
Don't try to cop pleas now son, it's dead and done
(I gave you fair warning) So run and get your guns
It's on, time to show em how I perform
My attitude will transform, leave you dead plus wrong
Gettin the flow within, representin for Queens
Shit is real, why you hopin that it's all a dream
But you can't wake up, wettin a chest you bless
Chokin off your own blood, don't blame me you brought your own death

Chorus:

Aiyo Noyd, it's on you, what you wanna do?

[Verse 2: Big Noyd, Prodigy]
My beeper kept beepin, the other numbers started leakin
'Who is this on my mind?' I was thinkin
Then I realised it was my dun playin 911
Once I seen the numbers I ran for the fuckin guns
My dun in trouble, I be there on the double
I jumped up in the bubble, yo kid where are you?
(1-14 between Manhattan and Morningside Avenue)
This happened just right out the blue
Aiyo dun, fuck that bitch, tell her get off your dick
(But she's cryin and she says she has feelins and shit)
Yo it's a set-up, them niggas got me fed up
Ty stay in the buildin, if they move fuckin buck em
Get up off the scene, you know what I mean?
And hide yourself down with them other fuckin sixteen
Glock and get off they block
Then I hung up the cellular, ready to rock
And it's on

Yo, you get deaded in the streets, kid set it
You gots no credit, fool you get wetted
Up with the semi-auto Mac double, love it
'Did he shoot eleven or twelve?' is what he wondered
Nigga I got one more shot, you must be drinkin
Put the heater to his head, watch him start blinkin
'Am I goin to heaven or hell?' is what he's thinkin
Switch to a bitch as his life start sinkin
Down to a level of no return
Pull out the heat cos when the slugs hit it definitely burns
Now chill and think about your life for real
Every member of my crew is livin life for real
Got your self fucked into somethin that you couldn't finish
Up against the fulliest squad and get diminished
I'm from Q-U-E another E-N-S
So why you small tough talk? I'm not impressed
If I seen you in the Bridge, I'd make you undress
Give up the money, the polo especially the Guess

Yo get that nappy up
*talkin to fade*[Hook: Havoc]
Uh huh, uh huh
The Mobb comin' through, no doubt kid
Schemin' in, layin' with the +Perfect Plot+ (+Perfect Plot+)
We the first one's awoke and the last one to sleep
And that's why we go the drop (Got the drop)
Rip shows, hit hoes
I'm the type of nigga that have your baby father vexed
Whatever you say bounces of me and right back to you
And if it get back to us then we clappin' you (What Duke?)

[Verse One: Prodigy]
Born to be wild, push to the front of the crowd
Top of the piles, state of the art, rhymes a 100 miles
I layed on chocolate clouds
Then pull out and let blow on any clown
Listen to the glow go round
Cut my silencer, the most powerfulest' weapon yet found
Hold it down, my tongue that is, to bring the biz, keep it tight
My mouth piece dispense my clips
Fuckin' wit me, the scenery get highly intense
Intelligent, gun buckers, duck fucka, you get bent ova
I'm not signin' out soldier, rocket launcher
Shank musketeer, face carpenter
You need down shit or slow down kid
Or get surrounded or pounded out, real quick
Aiyo check out what the storm blew in...

[Hook: Havoc]

[Verse Two: Big Noyd]
Check the main attraction of these raps shit
The infamous slapped some shit
On the track and get, the whole atlas wide open
Is stuck on it, you need to hang it up like I wanted
You shit borin', rappin' pourin' on your head like its stormin'
Hell fire, Vietnam your whole outfit, get re-rounded
Yo you bout it bout it, though I doubt it doubt it
While your girl scouted, I be repin QB drownin'
Box is the Heineken's, Gin bottles with the handle
Rubber handles and crack paper
Get flipped and stack paper
The beats flavor, make your pile more greater
Fuck y'all Mobb haters
We got y'all wives on the bed'er, while you playin' wit her
We makin' her loose and turned on
She loves when thugs is glowin', she get aroused
When I walk around with the gun showin'
The Mobb steady blowin' with this 9-8 shit
Before I had my clip, before I had my click
A nigga wasn't shit
Y'all niggas wasn't feelin' this shit
Now y'all hearin' it, get of my dick
Y'all niggas sick like a virus
I wish one of y'all niggas try this...

[Hook: Havoc]

[Verse Three: Havoc]
The Mobb got it locked down
Still heavy  racin it's the V.I
New niggas were shook, ain't it ill how we can? *vettias*?
No stoppin' this, it's approximate that you would be copin' this
Head lockin' shit bring it back where its suppose to be
Take a dose of this, guarantee cats will be stuck
Check the QBC just to cop from us
M O B B, make no mistake it's us
Though it was hav shit, spread the shit that was laced with death
You all fucked up, should bring, no one to trust
Walk in the street with the bag'acho and it's still Dutch
Rep the 41st side and hold the title with pride and when it's on
Use the infrared for guide, aim at yo renta
I'm like liquor in the winter, keep it warm, but make things
Extra high when you enter, fuckin' faggot
Have you hoppin' like rabbits for carrots
No need the name, yo we already established

[Hook: Prodigy] X2
The Mobb comin' through, no doubt kid
Schemin' in, layin' the +Perfect Plot+ (+Perfect Plot+)
We the first one's awoke and the last one to sleep
And that's why we go the drop (Got the drop)
Rip shows, hit hoes
I'm the type of nigga that have your baby mama wet
Whatever you say bounces of me and right back to you
And if it get back to us then we clappin' you (What Duke?)

[Hook: Havoc]Intro:
Extrordinary. Extrordinary. Yo (alright)

Big Noyd:
The trife life of living famous bustin' shots live it's dangerous
In midnight we do it right in clear blue light
The trife life rough wearin' handcuffs like bracelets
25 to life we faced it
Got on the run and got wasted
Mad agony havin' me more vexed
Got me pullin' out techs on opposite sex (uh)
The cream got me fiend (fiend) for masterville scheme (scheme)
Like doin' drivebys in stretched limozeens
I got tons of guns (uh) my niggas on the run pack the nickel plated ones
Get the cheddar however dun cause niggas got dreams
Painted king the drug sling got they brain drained
Just to sling cocaine continusly seriously
My brain blunted the lye done it
We makin' hundreds that's all we wanted
To see my ill mean team seein' cream
The Infamous comin' outta Queens
Yo check it check it

Prodigy:
Yo it's the Pee me and the N.O.Y.D
We put the chedda togetha so we can double the o.z.s
It grows like some family trees and beanstalks
Some hustlers naturally born with street smarts
Yo Karate it's you and Gotti y'all lift the weight
Me and Noyd'll Gem Star it down on a plate
The Mobb niggas living wild inside of New York state
The five gates, if a nigga is shook let him shake
While the coke back
Chef trip cook a boulder over the shoulder
With the wonders with they hands in pot holders
Soloist get rolled over
Rappin' Noyd takin' over you crossed over
Then you bucked in October
November, December came out the hospital keyed up
Paralysed from your feet up now slow ya speed up (uh)

Hook:
Big Noyd:
So recognize and realize I'm not the nigga lied
On the side of me Prodigy on the strength of who he be

Once the main man drop I got it locked to take it all why not?
Don't let that nigga Noyd get the drop I'm comin' steady heavy
Ready to murder pullin' triggers (triggers)
Soon to be famous dangerous type of nigga
I'm type crucifix definatly true to this
The natural born hustler Noyd finessin' it
Use to hustlin' tustlin' bustin' niggas wide open
No Jokin' like Rakim you must be smokin' (uh)
To fuck around with this you try to compare you didn't hear?

Prodigy:
Pioneer is extra ordinary rap flow
Sneek peek my Mobb style we clapped at your rap show
We formulate judged debatin' like some polititons
And come together like some coalition in position (wooo)
My team'll huddle your scheme was too suttle
Our crews cross paths your whole swarm face get bubble
Lookin' for trouble afraid so you found a couple
Me and rappin' Noyd blastin' off like NASA space shuttle (uh)
Prodigy my powers refined now they erupt in time
For climax you small cats what is you touchin'?
We complex your man got slapped just off of reflex
Learn from his mistake so avoid from being next
Holiday thugs occassionally act like thugs
Battery backs with Alkaline and Duracell mugs
A-yo Noyd these niggas must be on powerful drugs (crazy son)

Hook (x2)

Outro:

In midnight we do it right in broad light
The trife life rough wearin' handcuffs like bracelets 25 to life we faced it

Got me pullin' out techs on opposite sex
The cream got me fiend for masterville scheme
