[Verse 1: Apathy]
I travel underground like the Goonies with a bag full of uzis
Emerging in a corner store where Arabs sell loosies
My banger's on the waist, I never wave it around
But I always chamber a round when there's strangers around
Set my phaser to kill, my force field is on max
Never relax, study the facts and stockpile gats
Cause the sky's about to bleed blood out from the clouds
This gas mask's in my backpack when walking through crowds
The post-apocalyptic, optic fitted with bionic circuitry
Surgically planted perfectly, no way to word it verbally
But extrasensory perception got me detecting
Any cop or detective, intercept them, and stop 'em with weapons

[Verse 2: King Syze]
King Syze, Vinnie Paz, we like Animal Hawk
Grammatical master for art, Heavy Metal we smashing your thoughts
We upper level, you rappers are technicians
Undergraduates I gotta doctorate when it comes to ripping
Scientific, I was spawned from a different species
And if you beat me, you gon’ fight me every time you see me
It’s never over, fuck Syze it's King Cobra
I’m brushing off my shoulders, spittin lethal plus we taking over
I’m getting older so I live by the new slogan
That Philly shit the barrel smoke will leave your head open
IIt’s open season on any rapper who want to beef with
The Army of the Pharaohs, yeah man we’ll bring the seasoning

[Verse 3: Crypt the Warchild]
Don't hit me with the drama, don't approach me 'bout no B.I
Cause I'm a Pharaoh king, and y'all ain't worthy of a reply
Bodies I've caught decomposing on the seaside
Catch me river dancing through the bloody waters, knee-high
Mind state is cutthroat, can't walk around deprived
My team shut it down, any access will be denied
Crown royal status Puerto-Ricans, that's how we ride
Nocturnal souls mesmerized by the streetlights
One shot at glory, game will never give you three tries
For the haters I've murked, they would love to see me die
Acid tripping vision, everything look hi-defy
Drugs, money, liquor, only things that get me by

[Verse 4: Jus Allah]
I got a lot of hate, I got to learn to love, stop the date
But some days I would rather murder than populate
Either way, I gotta open up the cosmic gates
Who knows what the future holds, gotta watch and wait
I can't function clear, keep a ton of guns and beer
I never sweat it, I get arrested like once a year
My gun big as two guns, you should cover your ears
Believe half of what you see and nothing you hear
Nobody listens, I got a lot of ground to cover
Bullets go in one ear and out the other
Tucked the weapon in, kick his face
In the blood pool like give him a taste of his own medicine

[Verse 5: Esoteric]
Impeach the president, I’m pulling out my ray-gun
Chuck D’s greatest line and y'all ain’t even thank him
Y'all ain’t on my radar, horrible like Hagar
Mos Eisleys flow, beats banging on the space bar
Haters get mad, start banging on the spacebar
Flip over the desk, ought to take it up with HR
Your bitch give Bad Brains, like she work for H.R
I be where the rays are, you wonder where the weights are
I’m a cannibal, you cats wonder where the plates are
I know that I’m immortal why you wonder where the gates are
I Cold Crush your Brother like Grandmaster Caz
Paz work with the .45 like Lakim Shabazz

[Verse 6: Blacastan]
I’m from the East Coast nigga, but I’m still loc'ed out
I grew up inside the crack-house, my moms was smoked out
You know the kid with the bummy kicks, holes in his jeans
Same shirt, chilling on some bummy shit
Yeah, that was me though, attracted to the metal like Magneto
Sneakers started talking like ay bandito
Got my own never borrowed or begged for shit
Now it's on cause I'm rolling with the Pharaohs legit
Tired of rappers always rhyming that bullshit
Catch at you at your CD signing, with a full clip
Now, how you feel about the Pharaohs and the Demigodz?
That’s what I thought nigga, because we large and in charge

[Verse 7: Celph Titled]
Keep shooters on stash, move and they blast
Refugees that came on an inner tube with a gat
Rubix Cuban code name, but you will respect the handle
Spend checks on Windex so I shine the chrome enamel
I throw hands with the devil so ain't much to fear after
Bitches cry over me, I'm a top tier rapper
American Idol with a wet wipe for you Desperate Housewives
Firecracker go off from my brick, the whole house white
And I will outright say that you soft
I write your favorite writer that you base your style off of
I'll let the Tec blast in ya, if the check cash finish
Shells give you a turtle-face, make ya back splinter

[Verse 8: Planetary]
With the semi-automatic, sipping henny in the attic
Spitting heavy with the god of the Serengeti blasted
Fasted, ‘till I downloaded the attachment
The hunger came back, and I’m eating like a savage
Walking through the labyrinth, imagining it’s Nazareth
Throwing more stones at the throne, lone catalyst
Puff puff pass it, that ain't ever been me
Only had the urge to annihilate the emcee
Used to ride the ten-speed, and copped the top ten sneaks
Never thought I’d be in Budapest counting ten Gs
But it all makes sense to me
Pharaoh clique sick man we thick more than ten feet

[Verse 9: Vinnie Paz]
If I ain’t heard of y'all rappers then you gotta be soft
That’s the reason why I talk about the bodies I caught
Bodies in north, New Haven down to New York
If it’s a fight they put in front of me, it’s gotta be fought
They got me in court for carrying the burner on the waist
My lawyer is an animal, he murdering the case
Boombox hardbody murdering the tape
I'll take your fucking heart like a burglar on a date
I’m magic with the four-fifth, perfect with the eight
I lavish with the lyricals, superlatives is great
Mash a motherfucker out, tourniquet his face
Jheri-head rappers ain’t assertive as the great, yeah[Verse 1: Celph Titled]
What I write in a verse is like magic tricks, Copperfield
Grab your chick, cop a feel
Cock the Glock for real, give you some cop appeal
Dynamite vest, na I ain't stressing nothing
With a smiley face sticker on my detonator button
Haters ask, "Is he bluffing or is he bugging?"
I don't know but I don't fuck with weed with the seed stuffing
What I blaze gets me oh so higher
Burn more white widow smoke than an old folks home on fire
I make change *cha ching*
I can hang a playground from a charm you should see the way my chain swings
You got the balls to diss? Won't have 'em afterwards
Cuz when I rap, contenders get killed, after all my words
I'm tired of all you rapping nerds trying to critique my shit
Like I ain't the mother fucking master of the baddest verbs
Celph Titled and the AOTP alliance will travel back in time
Smack ya, have your baby teeth flying!

[Verse 2: Jus Allah]
I am Rob Zombie, I am the Omni of dishonesty
I'm a prodigy, an atrocity
Not a lot of promise in me
Positively not a drop of modesty
My philosophy is the policy
I believe in nothing
Try teaching a beast peace and loving
Juggling, my beliefs need readjusting
My life was sticks and rocks
Kick, punch, block
It was not a box of butterscotch and shuttlecocks
I have filled a pot of mud, spilled a lot of blood
Watch the drops drip and flood, hit the top stud
I have crashed a lot of waves, dug a lot of graves
Drunk a lot of grapes, I have fucked a lot of babes
I'm do not disturb, I have punched a lot of nerds
Struck a lot of curbs, I have cut a lot of curves
You are none of the above, push come to shove
You're all mother fucking puppy lovin' country clubs!

[Verse 3: Apathy]
Y'all motherfuckers ain't running shit, y'all simply runaways
I walk the surface of the sun while you're rocking stunner shades
I'm in Hell shoving flames while you're sweating summer days
I'm the son of Satan, son of Sam, sicker some'll say
Got a flow so cold that I could blow the sun away
Even if I kick a free someone still gonna pay
You could get blasted, body in a funeral casket
And cops searching for deoxyribonucleic acid
Slay the fascists, Pharaoh fans pray for classics
Come through in Raiders jackets to make this magic
I'm a holy man, Voodoo priest, rebel that'll shoot police
You wake up from this nightmare and change your little doodoo sheets
Skeleton crusher creature from the cryo-chamber
The naughty, nasty, trashy microphone annihilator
It's AP apparently you motherfuckers missed me
Some dude tried to diss me, now that kid's history!

[Verse 4: Planetary]
Now you see the misery, I heard it needs company
Who the fuck else want to bleed in their Dungarees?
Planetary man, the evil rap Desert Eagle
Clap all your people get ready for the sequel
Needle set to vinyl, now it's time for your final thought
What's your last wish? You's a minor fine in court
Twenty five to life, rap electric chair
Spit a sicker syllable, nigga slash like the slayers hit you
Get the picture, this a Kodak moment
Mo 'Yak flowin', pussy, bet your throwback on it
I'mma break bread only if the bread ain't stale
Take young niggas to school, I heard school like jail
This is punishment government shit that you fucking with
Esoteric, I told him in "Swords Drawn" and "Dump the Clip"
Hear the "Battle Cry" piling up the dead solders
Know to "Tear it Down", we get it down, the blood runs colder!

[Verse 5: King Magnetic]
After drive-by, hop out the wheel like caged hamsters
Rage amped up, hammer time without the stage dancers
I really doubt we're killing it the same
I'm Magic before retirement, illest in the game
Diligently aim at targets without the Pizza Hut express shit
Put 'em in a long box like bread sticks
Then dip marinara or garlic, Marijuanacaholic
Carry arms like your sidekick, shoulder hold to drop kick
Your show's supposed to be mosh pits; it's only known for obnoxious
Knowingly holding most of them hostage
Know I'm close to the top ten, Coka Nostra and Rakim
Roast the most of the Pac shit
Overdose for the profit
Hold him over don't drop him, watch this
Nonsense and don't slow up the process
Hate on my project, lay you unconscious
Screaming on the phone like you won a radio contest!

[Verse 6: Vinnie Paz]
The only fucking thing I love is my long knife
The .45 cal click pow, put you on ice
Before the devil know you dead you should call Christ
All I hear is barking out of y'all, a real dog bites
If you wanna split the tribe you should call Fife
I'm the real father of creation of God's life
LeBron in the beginning of the game, yeah I toss white
Calm at the beginning of the pain, Dalai Lam-like
Then I put your fucking brain in a strong vice
Eat your liver over fava beans and some warm rice
Y'all motherfuckers head cracked like I toss dice
Vinnie taking all your money like a divorced wife![Verse 1: Sean Strange]
Yo

Punish the game, I grabbed the mic and shut your label down
Fuck all the fame, I trash your life then come and take the crown
Sean might dock, I make your whore like cock
Because before me, shorty was a poor dyke twat
Im not the type to like to keep the shit fair when I'm fightin'
If i don't have a weapon then prepare for the bitin'
Im lighting your crib up like a holiday decoration
We sick fucks thank god for my medication
I bomb on your reservation, Osama is in my basement
The problems your probly facing, the obstacles I'm creating
Illogical observation make your dream empty
I'll leave your style cramped like PMD

[Verse 2: PMD]
Aiyo

I destroy tracks with real MC's skills and tacs
PMD, Parish Making Dollars, so get the Prozac
Dom radio rap, cold plays from the shotgun
Lettin' the hands go, airin' it out, the P's hot son
Doing shows on rooftops with Nas and Rakim
P's on this indie hustle who can stop him
Nothing, so what you saying?
This is rap of the titans, still poppin' off, still producin', still writin'
Using the slack…(?)….that's no cypher
Its the grim reaper reaping, time to pay the piper
And if you still into P kid, then spark your lighter
Im on fire, PMD rocking gods attire

[Verse 3: Prevail]
From the stronghold of the BAX WARS, elite service brigade
A formidable performer with abnormal feats of strength
To great lengths, he trained
Hot suns and cold rains
Young age taught how to crack axe through foes brains
Throw spears at long distance, control the chariots reigns
Finally if combatted attitude is hand to hand
Understands the one who wins will still be standin' in the sand
Fills competitors with lead as blood splatters on the fans

[Verse 4: Mad Child]
Okay, Peter Parker, Norrin Radd
Silver Surfer, Spider Man
We can light a room up brighter than a million lighters can
Ain't nobody tighter than this titan I'm a fighter man
Quick, Vitals fans got too excited taking vitamins
Iron man on acid
Tyranny fantastic
Im a ball of fire, I'm for hire if your askin'
Calling me a liar, put that bastard in a trash can
Im a fan of P and never laughing wearing Afghan

[Verse 5: Jus Allah]
Im cutting my appetite
Just till fright night
The blood filled me up with white light
Gotta strike right when the donor is just right
Should of got the name of the owner and blood type
Maybe I should go back and roam the abduct site
Lookin' for a lady with the path to love bite
Gotta use a whole lot of Dove and plus white
Hopefully I don't smell of blood and bloodlight

[Verse 6: Impakt]
This the entourage, a revolution of rhyme
Turn that garbage music off, its pollutin' your mind
Wake up, we some Reel Wolves amongst a bunch of cloned sheep
They wanna bring you down I'm staying up like no sleep
I want it all, fuck getting a portion
I killed the fucking instrumental
Gave the beat an abortion
Im a titan up right here exciting your life when I'm writin'
Ignitin' the mic, I'm fightin' like Tyson strickin' like lightning
Impakt, got the strength and i hold the force
To keep deliverin' the …(?)… with no remorse
Ill take your son, highway to hell yeah I'm trafficking
Somebody let me out my cage, I'm a savage beast

[Verse 7: ODoub]
Don't be a retard
I was killing it when the beat start
Youll see stars, got fans screaming like teens at them parks
Spitting mean bars, every line i come to life
My musics beautiful
You make butter faces with underbites
And you the sucka type, homie time to take off
I break jaws, tackling faggot rappers off skateboards
And fuck you whack dudes
Im bout to puff a fat deuce
Then cover my body full of illuminati tattoos

[Bridge: Sean Strange] x2
Yo get the fuck back, we run rap
(Reach in to the toolbox)
Cause every one whack, we on maps
(Spawned in the Goondox)
Die fighting, flesh cracker to lightning
Knife in the back from the raps of the titans

[Verse 8: Klee Magor]
Swing the battle-axe, unleash my Hit Squad
The cliques hard, like a pack of Reel Wolf savages in the yard
You step on land mines, your man dies
Body blown apart
Napoleon Bonopart, ….(?)
Fighting like David and Goliath
Try and face a messiah
The fire is higher
Never put my faith in …(?)
The mind of a writer, the heart of a lion
Apart of a dyin', divine breed
More to me before I stab your arteries
With raps of the titans
Strengthened with lines that I'm writin'
Hear the blast of the siren
…(?)…trapped with the iron
Im fighting like on my own verse is an Aztec
I blast tech, slash necks
Smash you in the face with a brass knuck

[Verse 9: Virtuoso]
Yo, Yo
Its the spas metropolis
With the sky's black apocalypse
Your fascist politics of oppression make digestion impossible
Need acidophilus
Either that or a lot of clips
You weak faggots soft as shit
Get left in a necropolis
Colossal, the Raps of the Titans
Im faster than lightning
Like a vampire bat I will siphon crimson plasma from your cadaver
Through chrome capture this, brimstone vernacular
Virtuoso master of the microphone masters

[Verse 10: Meth Mouth]
Its the meth eugenic lieutenant
Anti-federal veteran
Since 9/11 I've been hidin' and plottin' my regiment
I can't afford not to be independent
A definite detention for these rappers is evident
I ain't let 'em out, the torcher chamber
I am a force of nature
The foulest to record a banger
Since they put cameras in the court of Bodega
This ain't Shawshank Redemption, but I'm sure to shank you
You ain't sure to wake up, you swaying thought you'd destroy your maker

[Verse 11: Shallow Pockets of Psych Ward]
On that medieval shit
If you walking on needle tips
Shallow Pockets talk illegal, rob your leadership
Up to me to make your heart pump beat skip
Plus this speak will … (?) bleed trip
Cut deeper than a cleaver with a clean tip
Blow a hole through your people like a clean inch
Reel Wolf, my squad team flicks
Snowgoons, Goondox, thats the streets best

[Verse 12: J Nyce of Psych Ward]
J Nyce turn the stage to the colosseum
Yeah, burn a flag for the non-believers
Whats swag, y'all fags, whats the meaning?
Cut bad, y'all mad, y'all screaming
Fuck rap, stop that y'all dreaming
My young bucks got you rug rats fleeting
Reel Wolf, show their teeth and you bleedin'
Psych Ward thats the team of the season

[Verse 13: Jaysaun]
Now I don't know nothing but Karate or Kung Fu
But I've been here before the Art of War without Sun Tzu
So I just let the bullets take flight like a javelin, travellin'
I don't deal with the back and forth babblin' of battlin'
Nah, beefs unravellin'
Blood starts spatterin'
So turn the lights on watch the roaches are scatterin'
Choke …(?)... your poked in the abdomen
Thats pure savagery, grabbin' men, stabbin' them
Apocalypto, rockin' a sling
Or bong hits with a skitzo while your knockin' the king
When they say Jaysaun, ain't nothin you can say to the God
But when you see me, the deity, just pray to the God[Prevail][Intro: Jus Allah]
Yeah son, white devil's been living it up for too long
It's about time it's over for that, you know I'm sayin?
I'm their worst fear, the black man, the white nightmare son
Recognize that, ya know? Get all you fiends taken
Get all that taken

[Verse 1: Jus Allah]
Yo, I was placed on the planet just to cause problems
Sperm I spawned from burnt holes in condoms
Heaven splits in the presence of excellence
A force to be reckoned with
Way too fucking strong to rely on your prayers and hopes
I walk out the jungle in bear-skinned coats
While you still scared of ghosts we cut throats
I introduce myself, the God is utmost
My brain never touched the soap
Refused to be another fucking slave that stuffed the boats
Off puffs of smoke, I'm fucking phenomenal
What I think is logical, to you is physically impossible
Take a blood drop from you, copy you
Just to get your own identical to tell you I'm unstoppable
Unsurpassable obstacle unsolvable
Math written in my chronicle, astronomical
Pass me the gun for man extinction
I piss in the fountains of youth you drink from
My stomach got young dead orphans in it
I eat from trash cans at abortion clinics

[Hook]
I'm a fucking nightmare
Young, black and just don't give a fuck
I just wanna get high and live it up
A nightmare
Young, black and just don't give a fuck
I just wanna get high..
A white nightmare
Young black and just don't give a fuck
I just wanna get high and live it up
A nightmare
Young, black and just don't give a fuck, nigga

[Verse 2: Jus Allah]
I'm the sickest beast walking, I read in the dark and spit
As the deepest thoughts of Steve Hawkins
Interpret fucking dolphins
Megallah stab Martians, disturbing the peace inside coffins
Even priests caution defying the science
Violent niggas, who carry the iron giants
No swine diets, the strength of Goliath
Hope your last rhyme is good enough to die with
Against madness, performing the black magic
Savage, I steal from the offering basket
And use it as my loot to buy blunts and sacks with
I give back by sharing with the niggas I rap with
Elite crooks, even the police be shook
My crib got dead cops attached to meat hooks
Dissecting 'em, I burn whatever left of 'em
Yo, my neighbor told me that a demon lived next to him
'Til I threatened him, "Yo cousin, we strapped"
All y'all dumb niggas just cover your cap
I love black, I wish that I was two shades darker
Be unbreakable like Hurricane Carter

[Hook]
I'm America's nightmare
Young, black and just don't give a fuck
I just wanna get high and live it up
A nightmare
Young, black and just don't give a fuck
I just wanna get high..
A white nightmare
Young black and just don't give a fuck
I just wanna get high and live it up
A nightmare
Young, black and just don't give a fuck nigga

[Verse 3: Jus Allah]
[?] succumbing to pain, you're so dumb that it numbs your brain at gunflame, your head should be hung in shame
Lynched and maimed, you're playing with the clinic's insane
Getting bit, up until the last minutes of game
Fuck the glitter and glitz, me and my click, only doin' nigga shit
Makin' hits, only black people benefit
Never put it on the rinse, clever
I never be tricked, God and Devil's blood'll never be mixed
For as long as I live and the lifeline that runnin' my kin
Merging minds with the swines from pig
Never should you test or fake your maker has, your face is slashed
Like a paper bag, pick your favorite mask
Hide your ass like diaper rash, blow you into fucking cybertrash
Make you take a fuckin' firebath, bitch
Speakin' on cassettes, I can teach your pets
Peakin' death, I could reach you after physical death
Eatin' your beating flesh entirely
Torchering the soul of you inside of me, I am irony
Like reading lion diary, the fiery
Only 5 percent of minds admire my entirety

[Outro: Jus Allah]
Yo, Jedi Mind Tricks forever
Megatrom, what the fuckin deal
Vinnie Paz, Enemy of Mankind Stoupe
Yo, what the fuck Cyclone
BA Barap break niggas backs
Fuck Yall. Stupid ass niggas[Jus Allah]
You might be the proud new father
I am their future martyr
Who slaughters like blood is the new water
Who's darker, who owns a tooth sharpener
Who's partner is a fool for his tool carver
No disputing, refutings, no eludings
Just shootings, feudings, no undoings
No diffusing, abusings, unexcusing
Shoestring removings becoming behooving
They don't pay me to kill but to stop killing
I don't hold my end of the deal, I should stop billing
Any lesser of an evil is not fulfilling
Don't text your house cleaner for a mop spilling
You're the trailer, teaser, I'm the feature
You ail, you're weaker, I am neither
I'm a leader, you're a cheater, deceiver
Easier, a receiver, breeder!

[Chief Kamachi]
Musical martyr who do it harder
Fresh to death, like a French funeral parlor
Church and Kamala hurts for the scholars
France holla, anywhere between the Earth and Shambhala
A black and white collar, grimy like crack pipes schwala
Trying to get a rap life dollar
Still spit it for shelltoes lottos with the velcros
It's killa code I dun did it till hell froze
Old school Guc jacket dirty elbows
My boombox blast the heavens
I talk shit, stuck bibles in the ass of reverends
They wonder what faith he is
Is he Muslim, Christian, or Atheist?
It don't matter, brain splatter just take a clip
Only present, ain't no way to escape the clique

[Vinnie Paz]
This a drama theme, you a faggot rapper drama queen
My body work is vicious quick enough to rock your spleen
Ain't nothin' funny sonny, even Vinnie's Glock is mean
Steady with a machete ready for me to chop your team
How is Bush still here, we shoulda been shot him
Hologram, Taliban, call me Vin Laden
You a new jack hustla, Vinnie been clockin'
You a new jack sucker, Vinnie been rockin'
I ain't hear you sucker, come a little closer
Close enough so I can rock you with a mini roaster (x2)

(Chorus)
These the last words of a nigga who's stressed
Shit on my mind, like "Can I live?", am I goin through death?
My first rhyme could be my last dependin on who's next in God's book nigga
I'm not shook, I'mma take it like a crook nigga
Slash on someone in the flesh, my roach lit
Got me spazzin and holdin my breath, I won't quit
Goin fast down a one way stretch in God's book nigga
I'm not shook I'mma take it like a crook nigga
Come on!
I'm a crook nigga, I'm a I'm a crook nigga (2x)

[Doap Nixon]
Everything ain't always what it seems
Either I blow steam, or fall back and blow cream
Cuz, the left hand's for the position of mic
I made a nigga wet himself when the mission ain't right
I'm on some OG shit, go fishin' at night
Scrub the jewels with toothpaste so the glisten is right
Fuckers, I'm on a level that you can't ignore
I prefer a boxcutter til' your face start to drip and pour
Catch me and Reef eating on South Beach
Smackin' niggas so hard his head'll leak out meat
Salute me or you better speak out peace
Cuz cats smoke so much oil niggas leak out grease
We play everyday just like the weekend
Because of Doap Nix
And the A to the O to the T to the P in this bitch

[Celph Titled]
Surgeon General's Warning:
I'm surgically injuring informants to resemble invalid deformed kids
Satan's orphan born forced to contort ribs
Expand my land look what one golf course did
Nine irons and three woods, goons with the spikey bats
Ali Baba swords swoosh-shaped in the Nike bag (damn)
Ask around they say for real "I'ma a rider man"
Ladies love my sniper aim 'plus they like my tiger fangs'
Spiders came, Oh!, from my grave when I rose out
Looked at the sphinx and, I chiseled the nose out
Fo'shizzle there's no doubt, the military unit of the Tibetan black magicians
Is here to make exact incisions
With radioactive equipment
And have you stabbed quick through your cheek flesh like we bass fishing
So crabs listen, there is no ass kissin'
Sloppy with my work, do my dirt with my mask missin'

[King Magnetic]
Flex guns like a shirtless jock
Half black, half animal cracker minus the circus box
I'm felt like Murs with the Slug
Emerge with a buzz
My words nerd's merged with a thug
Pride added to poverty equals robbery
Over larder weed with more traffic than Joggasee (??)
I'll eat your God degree, Allah decree
Stay in the cut like words wrote across the crease
Magnetic and Vin Paz, we been spazzed
Live fast from a quick slash to a skin graft
I'm a jail dude
It's harder to come up on bail dude
I'm harder than stomaching jail food
It's part of dumb luck that fail you
Right when you need it most
Squeezin' throats, choked til' your Caesar's close
I'm the reason that the Eagle's close
Rough times tough lines
Number five with the ?? poach

[Demoz]
Yo, who wanna get stabbed and shot?
Dig a hole, let the casket drop
Norman Bates back, pass the Glock
Shoot his face when I pass the block
Tell the world suck a dick, dirty ass, and twat
Moz
Sick in the head, ask my pop
He dead, fuck if he gone nigga ask a cop
I'm tellin God how I feel if he ask or not
I roll with Outerspace call me astronaut
Kamach, Kenny the Kid, Reef, and King
Vinnie blew the whistle last minute, D is in
Double G's, xanny popper mixing weed and gin
Spanish fleet when I pop up, let the demons in
Terrorize your whole hood, dirty T's and Timbs
I'ma birth the whole game, let the semen in
Nigga
I'm the mothafuckin' reason when
Niggas snitch niggas die
Put ya spliffs in the sky[Hook: Block McCloud]
We're so sick with the flow, sing along like you caught A disease
Manifest in the mirror, don't sing lip shows
We go beyond Man it's hard to believe
Guess we're blessed it's a miracle So watch
It's the Army Of Pharaohs bring your squad to its knees
Go from flesh to the spiritual Gotta pray for a miracle
Like Moses when he parted the seas
Yes, yes, it's a miracle

[King Magnetic]
They call me stupid on the stoop, I'm in the studio with Stoupe
I'm unusually loose, in the movie role it true
Ghost star, don't spar with no artist my level
Froze target, slow harvest, bull guarded by metal
So god but so ghetto, so far but so settled
Don't harbor no problems, father's slow peddle
Rosette may bloom, outsize the medal
We all got a history of violence on the record
Except for this record Babygrande, if this lady take the stand
Then my record's playing in the court like a reggae band
Still a lady's man, mag expects it
I don't get brain, I test dames' gag reflexes
Ecstasy dealer, I bag they X's
Stab 'em breathless without grabbing breakfast
I might pull ahead, or with something out with air holes
Get lower than a flat when I'm reaching where the spare goes

[Hook: Block McCloud]

[Vinnie Paz]
Yeah, yo
You can Never fuckin' test the God
The kickback of the Smith & Wesson hard
Allah think that you a devil for ingesting lard
That's a part of every lesson that he said the far
Vinnie never claimed to be a prophet, I'm a vessel God
Me and my seven Mac-11s have a special bond
Same bond when the Qu'ran give me a special calm
I wave the motherfuckin' ratchet like its Desert Storm
And use it so I can detach you from your legs and arms
Im the one who reinventin the steel
The one who took the art of rhymin', reinvented the wheel
My venom will kill
My spit game like a neurotoxin
They call me blood and guts warrior, Arturo Boxin
It's nothing anything or anyone can do to stop 'em
Matter of fact even attemptin', it's a foolish option
Anyone who try to disrespect my crew, I pop em
Or tell the rest of the Boriqua, bring the tool and ox 'em

[Hook: Block McCloud]

[Jus Allah]
Bury them and the Aryans that carried them
All stare, scared their humanitarians
Spare none of them, tear their young from them
Shun them, run them into Kingdom Come's conundrum
Hunt them, punish them, confront them
Drunken them, come undone Sunken
Summons him from the stomach of a sunless dungeon
Bludgeon them, make the chump to become consumption
Not an option to stop us, fairly obvious
They're innocuous, the despair of the populous
Get your fill of ill-gotten goddesses
Drill them with a modest amount of bottomless promises
Turn the water scarlet red, let it churn from the faucet heads
Get to detailed little trails in the carpet threads
Have 'em adamantly smack on the architect
Havin' carte blanche on the carnage, have my heart set[Jus Allah]
I have sublime comprehension, Divine Intervention
My enzymes studied by the minds at Princeton
To figure my design would divide the Christians
Complete Truth, brothers been deprived of listening
A secret odyssey, ungodly, cursing prophecy
Reading verses that will Preach a Demonolgy
I speak scholarly Lord vain
Require more brain than your physically ordained to contain
I'm on the next plane where everything exists one and the same
Where pleasure is pain and never rains
I seen what you fear, I've passed beyond that
The things that give you tears, I have laughed and yawned at
Your fucking heart tastes so weak and rank
I have to eat dog food just to keep my strength
And my door's wide open for anybody that wants some
But I don't even live inside a house, I haunt one

*scratches

[Jus Allah]
I'm a prize, FBIs want me alive
They found the car, morgue of flies, I taught them to drive
Fall through knives till every single part of you dies
Couldn't figure my designs if you started at 5
Defend for yourself, you'd be broken in tears
You fool you could probably pull rope through your ears
You sweat cold, grafted original web-toe
My mind in the physical mould would explode
If what I knew spread round the globe
They'd start measuring my head for a crown of gold
Your weak soul is tryna climb a greased pole
In the deepest hole, defeating man at his peakest role
And seek to read my power for its evil use
But I can see the truth, I can teach Greek to Beetlejuice
I'm high as fucking hypodermic needle use
I'll even fucking piss in your mouth, give you legal proof

*scratches

[Jus Allah]
I'm the Chess King, the difference between boxing and wrestling
Knowing you guessing, only all seeing the present
Being of supreme measuring, unquestioning
You're not anything, I am everything
You second string, to go against a much advanced mind
Your dumb, you wash your hands before you eat swine
Simple cavemen too dense to even talk to us
There ain't an idea in his head I haven't thought of
You thin skulled, a numbskull, my skin's gold
More valuable than yours tenfold
Repute from now is the day of reckoning
The truth shall sound so loud it's deafening
Never will you come overpower my word
My unploughed dirt will grow the last flowers of earth
In the last hours of mirth, I'll be left to laugh at it
Watching how the walls of space collapses on these savages
Evil parishes, disappearing in its own parrells
Proving ignorance is erroneous
I was chosen to write the future as the Lord said
Wouldn't be surprised at waking with an eye in my forehead

*scratches[Hook]
"I pull a .44 from outta the seat; I body the beat
Clear nigga's outta the street; nobody can creep"
"Holler when it's time for the blood to get spilled"
"When the hammer cock, we don't care who we pop"

[Verse 1]
I'm gun crazy; that's how every rhyme has begun lately
I'm not somebody who cares a lot for someone's safety
I'm not somebody who stops and makes a 180
I'm not somebody who has a job and a young lady
My shots starts spittin' till your body parts stiffen
Physicians is over your heart, listenin'
I like to let my gun stare in the face of a fallen victim
If he waits, he'll want the hair of the dog that bit 'em
But I never get a reply; it's eye for an eye
With me, it’s once bitten, twice shy
Got a lot of guns in the supply
So I gotta wet niggas now: can't wait till the water runs dry
It's bloodshed in the streets. I am indebted to the deceased
The dead can't rest without peace
I'm chased by the damned and the police
You do a lot of dirt, you wake up with sand in the sheets

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
My gat heavy: I need a flatbed on the back of a Chevy
I need half of a second to be packed and ready
Then I'm out the door, puttin' in time and labour
So if my gun overweight, then I'm its enabler
Cops chasin' me; I can't escape my violent past
So I got to eat and run, or dine and dash
People wanna meet the man that's behind the mask
Cause my face been all over the simulcast
But I'm always outside; I restrain the fight
Cause the best place to hide is in plain sight
I'm a machine; my murders last days and nights
With no traces of DNA or data bytes
I heard cops coming. I left the gun on the floor
I left a bucket of blood above the front door
Wish I was there: they probably were in an uproar
But we all square: all's fair in love and war

[Hook][Verse 1: Jus Allah]
I only rise when it's time for me to fuck or get high
Or when my ninth life dies and I'm up in the skies
Me and rhymes match perfect like devil and lies
He only wish he had purpose on a level of mines
God Jus Allah hurts, like natural birth
Without a dad or a nurse, can't imagine it worse
You're only mad in your verse, this my actual thirst
My simplest words, more than you can fathom at first
Go back to your church, hope your motherfuckin luck works
Dumb fucks like yourself just stuff earth
To me god takes time there's a waiting line
I can break your fucking faith like hate crime
You're so mere, I wish you'd disappear
The lake of fire burns red devils to crystal clear
I never went to sixth grade I skipped a year
Once I found I had a way in my brain to shift the gears

[Verse 2: Singapore Kane]
When my dogs hunt you, ain't no place safe you can run to
Monestary's or Mosques, none of them will want you
Your clock is ticking when death haunts you
And when the cannon blow you away your fam wonder where you gone to
Heaven or hell the eye swell from remembering
The day you got stopped like Singapore was an Indian
Save all the talk, cause when guns buck
Niggas get burnt alive like Joan of Arc
You can't stop a solider who's a known bi-polar
Epileptic dyslexic gun holder
You be dead for days till someone smell your odor
Bugs earth and air decomposure
And your friends told you chill before this just a graphic scene
You got more bitch in you than Maxin magazine
I pass Glocks to Bomshot
And me him and Jus Allah plot to spill blood like pom pot

[Verse 3: Bomshot]
The master builders
We buildin' on 5 pillars
Raise your sword in the name of the lord we snake killers
My rhymes are many signs for mankind to marvel
When I die I'm in the sky, in mansions made of marble
So imma' set it straight
Why would God hesitate
When I meditate and cause the holy shrine to levitate
Even when it rains
My thoughts remain sunny
I prance out of gardens with rivers flowing honey
We climb onto golden charretes
Only angels carry it
My dick swings low, you can call me sweet chariate
My pure beams of light
That could uphold the skies
Just one of the many blessings from the mighty the wise
Who gave you eyes ears nose mouth and hands to observe
You ingrate, little things you give in return
Come put your life on the line
Best believe I could hurt that
You'll rest eternally
Go take a motherfuckin' dirt nap[Verse 1: Apathy]
I travel underground like the Goonies with a bag full of uzis
Emerging in a corner store where Arabs sell loosies
My banger's on the waist, I never wave it around
But I always chamber a round when there's strangers around
Set my phaser to kill, my force field is on max
Never relax, study the facts and stockpile gats
Cause the sky's about to bleed blood out from the clouds
This gas mask's in my backpack when walking through crowds
The post-apocalyptic, optic fitted with bionic circuitry
Surgically planted perfectly, no way to word it verbally
But extrasensory perception got me detecting
Any cop or detective, intercept them, and stop 'em with weapons

[Verse 2: King Syze]
King Syze, Vinnie Paz, we like Animal Hawk
Grammatical master for art, Heavy Metal we smashing your thoughts
We upper level, you rappers are technicians
Undergraduates I gotta doctorate when it comes to ripping
Scientific, I was spawned from a different species
And if you beat me, you gon’ fight me every time you see me
It’s never over, fuck Syze it's King Cobra
I’m brushing off my shoulders, spittin lethal plus we taking over
I’m getting older so I live by the new slogan
That Philly shit the barrel smoke will leave your head open
IIt’s open season on any rapper who want to beef with
The Army of the Pharaohs, yeah man we’ll bring the seasoning

[Verse 3: Crypt the Warchild]
Don't hit me with the drama, don't approach me 'bout no B.I
Cause I'm a Pharaoh king, and y'all ain't worthy of a reply
Bodies I've caught decomposing on the seaside
Catch me river dancing through the bloody waters, knee-high
Mind state is cutthroat, can't walk around deprived
My team shut it down, any access will be denied
Crown royal status Puerto-Ricans, that's how we ride
Nocturnal souls mesmerized by the streetlights
One shot at glory, game will never give you three tries
For the haters I've murked, they would love to see me die
Acid tripping vision, everything look hi-defy
Drugs, money, liquor, only things that get me by

[Verse 4: Jus Allah]
I got a lot of hate, I got to learn to love, stop the date
But some days I would rather murder than populate
Either way, I gotta open up the cosmic gates
Who knows what the future holds, gotta watch and wait
I can't function clear, keep a ton of guns and beer
I never sweat it, I get arrested like once a year
My gun big as two guns, you should cover your ears
Believe half of what you see and nothing you hear
Nobody listens, I got a lot of ground to cover
Bullets go in one ear and out the other
Tucked the weapon in, kick his face
In the blood pool like give him a taste of his own medicine

[Verse 5: Esoteric]
Impeach the president, I’m pulling out my ray-gun
Chuck D’s greatest line and y'all ain’t even thank him
Y'all ain’t on my radar, horrible like Hagar
Mos Eisleys flow, beats banging on the space bar
Haters get mad, start banging on the spacebar
Flip over the desk, ought to take it up with HR
Your bitch give Bad Brains, like she work for H.R
I be where the rays are, you wonder where the weights are
I’m a cannibal, you cats wonder where the plates are
I know that I’m immortal why you wonder where the gates are
I Cold Crush your Brother like Grandmaster Caz
Paz work with the .45 like Lakim Shabazz

[Verse 6: Blacastan]
I’m from the East Coast nigga, but I’m still loc'ed out
I grew up inside the crack-house, my moms was smoked out
You know the kid with the bummy kicks, holes in his jeans
Same shirt, chilling on some bummy shit
Yeah, that was me though, attracted to the metal like Magneto
Sneakers started talking like ay bandito
Got my own never borrowed or begged for shit
Now it's on cause I'm rolling with the Pharaohs legit
Tired of rappers always rhyming that bullshit
Catch at you at your CD signing, with a full clip
Now, how you feel about the Pharaohs and the Demigodz?
That’s what I thought nigga, because we large and in charge

[Verse 7: Celph Titled]
Keep shooters on stash, move and they blast
Refugees that came on an inner tube with a gat
Rubix Cuban code name, but you will respect the handle
Spend checks on Windex so I shine the chrome enamel
I throw hands with the devil so ain't much to fear after
Bitches cry over me, I'm a top tier rapper
American Idol with a wet wipe for you Desperate Housewives
Firecracker go off from my brick, the whole house white
And I will outright say that you soft
I write your favorite writer that you base your style off of
I'll let the Tec blast in ya, if the check cash finish
Shells give you a turtle-face, make ya back splinter

[Verse 8: Planetary]
With the semi-automatic, sipping henny in the attic
Spitting heavy with the god of the Serengeti blasted
Fasted, ‘till I downloaded the attachment
The hunger came back, and I’m eating like a savage
Walking through the labyrinth, imagining it’s Nazareth
Throwing more stones at the throne, lone catalyst
Puff puff pass it, that ain't ever been me
Only had the urge to annihilate the emcee
Used to ride the ten-speed, and copped the top ten sneaks
Never thought I’d be in Budapest counting ten Gs
But it all makes sense to me
Pharaoh clique sick man we thick more than ten feet

[Verse 9: Vinnie Paz]
If I ain’t heard of y'all rappers then you gotta be soft
That’s the reason why I talk about the bodies I caught
Bodies in north, New Haven down to New York
If it’s a fight they put in front of me, it’s gotta be fought
They got me in court for carrying the burner on the waist
My lawyer is an animal, he murdering the case
Boombox hardbody murdering the tape
I'll take your fucking heart like a burglar on a date
I’m magic with the four-fifth, perfect with the eight
I lavish with the lyricals, superlatives is great
Mash a motherfucker out, tourniquet his face
Jheri-head rappers ain’t assertive as the great, yeah[Verse 1: Jus Allah]
I puff the best plants
It ain't a drug test at the death camp
I don't change the motherfucking bed pans
Time to change the bucket where the heads land
Clear it for the next damned
Lefthanders don't belong near Bethlehem
Severe reprimands, cruel and unjust, - the fun stuff
I got a blood lust, call me a lush
You say prayers for the dead like air heads
You mixed up the round holes and square pegs
Rock your dome knock lose wads and combs
Blow down your homes into cobblestone
The aftermaths a disaster zone, a wasteland
The blast radius disintegrates ape man
Wakin' up another morning, blood on my shirt
Never gets boring, when true love is at work
I see dead people, I never see enough
The ambulance, is an ice cream truck

[Hook: Jus Allah & iCon the Mic King]
What's mines is mines
What's yours is mines
The black arts, art of rhyme, it's our time
Two voices, one mind
The king and the god
From darkness to sunshine

[Verse 2: iCon the Mic King]
Retaliation comes when the fallen angels perfect their scrolls
I'll delete your file once I decompile your genetic code
Took a blessed oath
A skill and a touch of honor
Always got to one up yall niggas like fuckin' contra
Fall victim to circumstance when I make a leap of logic
I run laps around time and teach inanimate objects
The plan and the process, so I won't have to be near
For yall niggas to fold under pressure, like beach chairs
I hit you so hard with your stares the spot where you land
Your organs will invert, you'll write with your opposite hand
I catered the last supper helped Jesus escape from the nails
Now I'm man handling you snakes to prove faith in myself
I'll stare into the sun until it's too scared to show and
I write two different rhymes at the same time with both hands
No chance, of you defeating me
Cause all life is vibration I'll tune out your frequency
Make speech manifest, easily designed to leave an imprint in the streets of China
I'm unlimited, think you can truly stop me
Remains to be seen like exhuming a body

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Jus Allah & iCon the Mic King]

(Jus Allah)
I need a down ass witch with a broomstick
Hammer and nails, and a six foot crucifix
A napkin and some toothpicks
Let my belt loose, after all the of the head I'm fucking useless

(iCon the Mic King)
I touch the music, and inert the infinity
You love abuse bitch, I'll convert you to energy
Me and Jus working in synergy, exposing the truth
I'll use a hammer to crack your smile like I'm making a sculpture of you

(Jus Allah)
Tear your culture in two
Reduce your crew down to a few
You only do what we allow you
Bow in the presence of the all powerful
Master of the day of requtial, I'm infallible

(iCon the Mic King)
We do the impossible divide by zero and get a result
I don't cast the shadow I am the shadow, I cast the self
[?] be alike, to the [?]
Because we both roll with the punches like lunch carts

[Hook x2][Vinnie Paz]
I am not human flesh
The waist line where the Ruger rests
I take Jesus Christ and rob him of his Jewishness
There's nothing anything or anyone can do to test
I live inside a jungle all I need is fruit that's fresh
Can't nobody find me I define elusiveness
I'm in the darkness in the dungeon where Medusa's kept
I'll aim a shotty at your body shoot it through your chest
And I'll take a second to remind you of your gruesome death
It ain't a question I don't have to prove I'm best
I've been rhymin' since the fuckin prime of Ricky Rubin's best
I wouldn't come against the army that's a losing bet
I'll throw your motherfuckin body off the roof and jet
I'll throw a left hook. It ain't a fuckin' tooth that's left
Your body bloodier and holier than Buddha's breath
I ain't fuckin' around with ya'll I'm like a dude possessed
We rockin' crowds in Philadelphia then Bucharest
It's World War and for me the German Luger's best
I like the way it kick back and what it do to flesh
Ayo! Jus Allah let em know why you the best
This is closure verse it's over cousin you is next

[Jus Allah]
Before you come to bed
Shut the light from his shrunkin' head
Soon enough you'll adjust learnin of the dead
The color red bloodshed
Stuff you dread. cut the thread
What your head would be puffed and tread
I am unkept unread underfed
Unsung uncredited Unsaid Unedited Defective Unaccepted
Don't expect to see the motherfuckin unexpected
May as well pay yourself to wait in hell
The spell: pace your self rearrange yourselves
May you live to say the story made to tell
Make your faith in prayer great enough to break the spell
I'm obsessed with watching death, rotting flesh
I'm refreshed by the process. I relent
Kill the cross-wearers kill their Pallbearers
Being soft on terror makes coffin sharers
Smelt a dead mans odor I ran over
Like a cat at the sound of a can opener
Put you in the land push a pile of sand over
Give your family no closure shows over[Verse 1: Jus Allah]
Return your motherfucking soul before my next blunt gets rolled
I eat you motherfuckers whole before the blood gets cold
Truth be told you talk like you two years old
Same shit you wanna hold like the purest of gold
When my rhyme begins everything that's on your mind ends
Eat slime from the vines like vitamins
Every message from Allah's like medicine
Everyone of them could purify the Devil's sins
Fucking fool, you probably flunked preschool
We ain't equals, I ain't readable
You're one step above your own mother feeding you
Unbelievable, dumb enough to be illegal
You couldn't get this high without a fucking needle
And a fucking supply to fry three people
Motherfuckers deserve their ugly ass heads hung
Only good fucking devils are dead ones

[Hook: Agallah]
I got nothing but hate for you fakes that be all in my face
For your snakes that's invading my space
Nothings ever gonna ease my head except seeing you dead
Can't sleep till you niggas is dead
There's nothing but hate for you fakes that be all in my face
Jealous niggas be wanting my place
And I won't eat until you motherfuckers is dead
Can't sleep till you niggas is dead

[Verse 2: Jus Allah]
I'm busting right at the priests, fuck your white Jesus
You're blinded by the light of deceivers and disbelievers
The real truth right in front of you
I am everyone and none of you, I gave my only begotten son to you
Return to Earth as a person
Only to see you mouse niggas running from the serpent
Blind and dumb, I'm rhyming till the Devil's rule is done
Allah see's a liar and a fool as one
Raise your holy flag, put me near the President's craft
I'll be riding to Iran with his head in a bag
Niggas know it's on till you dead and done with
Your head's hunted till I'm signing your death warrant
Holding myself down on the black side
Y'all stay on that side, I'm a piece of God magnified
Fucking truth never needs to be advertised
You could learn fucking that one in the afterlife

[Hook: Agallah]

[Verse 3: Jus Allah]
The power that I hold in my hand could fold a frying pan
The air and sand do as I command
And if i want the night to last across the sky mass
The clouds won't even allow light to pass
My crew cleave alien loops inside grass
Roll trees and dutch masks, loot some brass
A must have like my dagger and cloak
And red streaks of blood on my white lab coat
A virgin thirst ____ to give her first poke
She crept over to my crib after church broke
Since, we ain't spoke but I hit it dumb ways
The unsaved, some days I don't bathe
Unphased by the light, the scorching flame
Tears form from the ice dripping off your brain
Even if you cry it won't soften the pain
Your heart is dead, you should go and get your coffin framed

[Hook x2: Agallah][Jus Allah]
I have sublime comprehension, Divine Intervention
My enzymes studied by the minds at Princeton
To figure my design would divide the Christians
Complete Truth, brothers been deprived of listening
A secret odyssey, ungodly, cursing prophecy
Reading verses that will Preach a Demonolgy
I speak scholarly Lord vain
Require more brain than your physically ordained to contain
I'm on the next plane where everything exists one and the same
Where pleasure is pain and never rains
I seen what you fear, I've passed beyond that
The things that give you tears, I have laughed and yawned at
Your fucking heart tastes so weak and rank
I have to eat dog food just to keep my strength
And my door's wide open for anybody that wants some
But I don't even live inside a house, I haunt one

*scratches

[Jus Allah]
I'm a prize, FBIs want me alive
They found the car, morgue of flies, I taught them to drive
Fall through knives till every single part of you dies
Couldn't figure my designs if you started at 5
Defend for yourself, you'd be broken in tears
You fool you could probably pull rope through your ears
You sweat cold, grafted original web-toe
My mind in the physical mould would explode
If what I knew spread round the globe
They'd start measuring my head for a crown of gold
Your weak soul is tryna climb a greased pole
In the deepest hole, defeating man at his peakest role
And seek to read my power for its evil use
But I can see the truth, I can teach Greek to Beetlejuice
I'm high as fucking hypodermic needle use
I'll even fucking piss in your mouth, give you legal proof

*scratches

[Jus Allah]
I'm the Chess King, the difference between boxing and wrestling
Knowing you guessing, only all seeing the present
Being of supreme measuring, unquestioning
You're not anything, I am everything
You second string, to go against a much advanced mind
Your dumb, you wash your hands before you eat swine
Simple cavemen too dense to even talk to us
There ain't an idea in his head I haven't thought of
You thin skulled, a numbskull, my skin's gold
More valuable than yours tenfold
Repute from now is the day of reckoning
The truth shall sound so loud it's deafening
Never will you come overpower my word
My unploughed dirt will grow the last flowers of earth
In the last hours of mirth, I'll be left to laugh at it
Watching how the walls of space collapses on these savages
Evil parishes, disappearing in its own parrells
Proving ignorance is erroneous
I was chosen to write the future as the Lord said
Wouldn't be surprised at waking with an eye in my forehead

*scratches[Verse 1: Jus Allah AKA Megatraum]
I am pure darkness, sparkless
Glitterless, imageless
But still infinitely limitless
Pre-Genesis before man
I crawled the land before all you know, even began
I think thoughts untranslated, I'm ungraded
My first rhyme had no words to say it
Force of the immaculate
You only exist cause I imagined it and slit your wrist upon fathoming it
Accurate intellect, the weight of my brain tilts my neck
Obeying the will, I select
My face so dark, that it doesn't reflect
The beast in me only awakes at sunset
My life has no connect, of hoping it
The blood I drink, has extra pulp in it
I spit rhymes in the graveyard of my block
I get a rush hearing them beat, the coffin tops
I grow my own trees in the woods I'm from
I need branches to leave niggas hung
I'm running out of higher density
So the gun on my waste, is the only thing holding me from floating into space

[Hook] x4
Dividers, conquerors and rough night stalkers
Monsters, pray amongst the upright walkers

[Verse 2: Jus Allah]
The black man spelled the word:science
The caveman was overwhelmed by it
Made himself deny it
Fed us trick-knowledge and lies
Kept us quiet
You can't hide the power and size, of a giant
Divine my physical eyes work independent in my mind
I read two pages at a time
Don't believe in prayer
I don't even breathe the same air
My heart don't need the same care
I never have trees to share
Cause I know passing weed to me is like fucking feeding the bears
We everlastin'beyond grasping
Mad man unexpressive of emotion, or compassion
Your girl fucked me fully aware in the action the germ I would pass to her had no vaccine
You a 'has-been', can't kill me, I'm guilty
I am what was then, I was what will be
I have clear skin, my soul face grew
It ain't a man brave enough to trade shoe
I wear fur-coats to the zoo
I ain't rich but I keep a bitch's throat roped in blue

[Hook] x4
Dividers, conquerors and rough night stalkers
Monsters, pray amongst the upright walkers

[Verse 3: Jus Allah]
My brainwaves shatter faces
Crack wrists, watch faces
Strong enough to switch the direction the clock paces
You hopeless, from a slave to a modern-day Moses
The oldest, my body gets off, the case closes
Release aggression, explode like atomic weapon
I go into deep spells of demonic possession
Gave the devil my rhyme book, just to read through
He hid it in his safe that he swallowed the keys to
Said:'Megatraum' I have nothing to teach you
There's no plague or harm to man more deceitful
Than a lost breed of evil
Fucking monstrous niggas, trade to kill inside their subconscious
Taken what's promised, derived from skies and comets
Accomplish, prophecies of Muhammad
I overpower shit, fuck the hater and the doubter shit
Chop off the top of your skull, drink out of it
Cowardly bitch I hear death in the wind
Notify next of kin, best of friends
Your limbs are lobbed off, by the Megatraum's axe
Forced to wack their own severed arms to catch

[Hook] x4
Dividers, conquerors and rough night stalkers
Monsters, pray amongst the upright walkers

[Outro: Jus Allah AKA Megatraum]
Yo it's Megatraum stupid motherfuckers yo
Yanomsayin? Moanin motherfucker, yo
Jedi Mind Tricks nigga[Jus Allah]
You might be the proud new father
I am their future martyr
Who slaughters like blood is the new water
Who's darker, who owns a tooth sharpener
Who's partner is a fool for his tool carver
No disputing, refutings, no eludings
Just shootings, feudings, no undoings
No diffusing, abusings, unexcusing
Shoestring removings becoming behooving
They don't pay me to kill but to stop killing
I don't hold my end of the deal, I should stop billing
Any lesser of an evil is not fulfilling
Don't text your house cleaner for a mop spilling
You're the trailer, teaser, I'm the feature
You ail, you're weaker, I am neither
I'm a leader, you're a cheater, deceiver
Easier, a receiver, breeder!

[Chief Kamachi]
Musical martyr who do it harder
Fresh to death, like a French funeral parlor
Church and Kamala hurts for the scholars
France holla, anywhere between the Earth and Shambhala
A black and white collar, grimy like crack pipes schwala
Trying to get a rap life dollar
Still spit it for shelltoes lottos with the velcros
It's killa code I dun did it till hell froze
Old school Guc jacket dirty elbows
My boombox blast the heavens
I talk shit, stuck bibles in the ass of reverends
They wonder what faith he is
Is he Muslim, Christian, or Atheist?
It don't matter, brain splatter just take a clip
Only present, ain't no way to escape the clique

[Vinnie Paz]
This a drama theme, you a faggot rapper drama queen
My body work is vicious quick enough to rock your spleen
Ain't nothin' funny sonny, even Vinnie's Glock is mean
Steady with a machete ready for me to chop your team
How is Bush still here, we shoulda been shot him
Hologram, Taliban, call me Vin Laden
You a new jack hustla, Vinnie been clockin'
You a new jack sucker, Vinnie been rockin'
I ain't hear you sucker, come a little closer
Close enough so I can rock you with a mini roaster (x2)

(Chorus)
These the last words of a nigga who's stressed
Shit on my mind, like "Can I live?", am I goin through death?
My first rhyme could be my last dependin on who's next in God's book nigga
I'm not shook, I'mma take it like a crook nigga
Slash on someone in the flesh, my roach lit
Got me spazzin and holdin my breath, I won't quit
Goin fast down a one way stretch in God's book nigga
I'm not shook I'mma take it like a crook nigga
Come on!
I'm a crook nigga, I'm a I'm a crook nigga (2x)

[Doap Nixon]
Everything ain't always what it seems
Either I blow steam, or fall back and blow cream
Cuz, the left hand's for the position of mic
I made a nigga wet himself when the mission ain't right
I'm on some OG shit, go fishin' at night
Scrub the jewels with toothpaste so the glisten is right
Fuckers, I'm on a level that you can't ignore
I prefer a boxcutter til' your face start to drip and pour
Catch me and Reef eating on South Beach
Smackin' niggas so hard his head'll leak out meat
Salute me or you better speak out peace
Cuz cats smoke so much oil niggas leak out grease
We play everyday just like the weekend
Because of Doap Nix
And the A to the O to the T to the P in this bitch

[Celph Titled]
Surgeon General's Warning:
I'm surgically injuring informants to resemble invalid deformed kids
Satan's orphan born forced to contort ribs
Expand my land look what one golf course did
Nine irons and three woods, goons with the spikey bats
Ali Baba swords swoosh-shaped in the Nike bag (damn)
Ask around they say for real "I'ma a rider man"
Ladies love my sniper aim 'plus they like my tiger fangs'
Spiders came, Oh!, from my grave when I rose out
Looked at the sphinx and, I chiseled the nose out
Fo'shizzle there's no doubt, the military unit of the Tibetan black magicians
Is here to make exact incisions
With radioactive equipment
And have you stabbed quick through your cheek flesh like we bass fishing
So crabs listen, there is no ass kissin'
Sloppy with my work, do my dirt with my mask missin'

[King Magnetic]
Flex guns like a shirtless jock
Half black, half animal cracker minus the circus box
I'm felt like Murs with the Slug
Emerge with a buzz
My words nerd's merged with a thug
Pride added to poverty equals robbery
Over larder weed with more traffic than Joggasee (??)
I'll eat your God degree, Allah decree
Stay in the cut like words wrote across the crease
Magnetic and Vin Paz, we been spazzed
Live fast from a quick slash to a skin graft
I'm a jail dude
It's harder to come up on bail dude
I'm harder than stomaching jail food
It's part of dumb luck that fail you
Right when you need it most
Squeezin' throats, choked til' your Caesar's close
I'm the reason that the Eagle's close
Rough times tough lines
Number five with the ?? poach

[Demoz]
Yo, who wanna get stabbed and shot?
Dig a hole, let the casket drop
Norman Bates back, pass the Glock
Shoot his face when I pass the block
Tell the world suck a dick, dirty ass, and twat
Moz
Sick in the head, ask my pop
He dead, fuck if he gone nigga ask a cop
I'm tellin God how I feel if he ask or not
I roll with Outerspace call me astronaut
Kamach, Kenny the Kid, Reef, and King
Vinnie blew the whistle last minute, D is in
Double G's, xanny popper mixing weed and gin
Spanish fleet when I pop up, let the demons in
Terrorize your whole hood, dirty T's and Timbs
I'ma birth the whole game, let the semen in
Nigga
I'm the mothafuckin' reason when
Niggas snitch niggas die
Put ya spliffs in the sky[Verse 1: Jus Allah]
Bullets take your life I take a hundred and fifties
Kiss yourself goodbye, ya body covered in hickeys
Keep the guns cocked for you fucking faggots and sissys
Always in the bad activity, actively
Slow with[???] twenty words and stab Agatha Christie
Stab both the whores in the abdomen and kidneys
Put the bodies where you play catch and toss Frisbees
Add to a long history of unsolved mysteries
Guns don't kill people, evil kills people
These streets is lethal but guns keep it equal
Take white chrome[???] and put you in the morgue
Take you from your Mom take your fucking chip off your arm
Keep biscuits like it's the fucking house of Saddam
Me and Reef the Lost Cauze spit an ounce of Patron
While your drowning in the fucking pond that the cops found you in
Pounding on your chest counting worm [???] one thousand

[Hook: Reef the Lost Cauze] [x2]
I call them cocksucker
You fucking dick taster
Ain't nobody fucking with Goons or Sicknature
Reef the Lost Cauze, Jus Allah we black as Vader
Fuck around again, I'll blaze ya
The euthanasia

[Verse 2: Reef the Lost Cauze]
And I pray ya, don't think God'll save ya
Heavy metal shit, metal clip, chrome Slayer
I'll blaze ya, feed you to a swarm of gators
I'm with King Jus, no hey ya hey ya
We started out minor now we fucking up the majors
Only crew close to AOTP Al-Qaeda
Face scrape ya, off the bottom of my Blazers
With more clips than a barbershop hand razor
I'm in the chair player gettin' a Philly fade
My niggas praise we'll make it rain/reign for fifty days
Fuck forty, she front and fuck shorty
You pour champagne in glasses faggot we drunk 40s
Empty nines, hold macs and dump .40s
Y'all dumb corny, wildin' 'til the lord come for me
L's twisted up, shells hittin' ya, you see hell sent for you
Box your fucking head off like P. Fell[???] with a drum

[Hook] [x4]

[Verse 3: Sicknature]
Sicknature's a goon blazin' a way that'll sickle fail
Beats create earthquakes that'll be breaking the Richter scale
Independent, rap venomous, when I'm deadin' you fast
You wouldn't listen to your own shit with your head up your ass (what?)
Stomach rumbles, my hunger increase, so I ain't coming with peace, Ammo flow clip dumpin' with Reef
No love when I jump on this beat
Smack cupid toothless and rob the tooth fairy when she come for the teeth
Beats of the week combined with the spit that I sneeze at you
We'll make you feel smaller than a dick on a Greek statue
Underground independence, me signed with a big major?
"Fuck y'all" signed to Sicknature
The rap actors got no clue
Get some arsenal instead instead shoved so far up your ass it'll look like a gold tooth
Fuck with my Goons that's a fatal approach
Cause panic like if the Yellowstone volcano explodes
Nature!!!

[Hook] [x3][Verse 1 : Anthro]
I take desperate measures for higher pleasure
Transform like Banner when I'm under high pressure
I'll be the hidden agenda
The unknown treasure
The secret offender amongst transcenders
Claiming that you Queen of the now
Bipolar women be acting different
Quick to snap in an instant
But things ain't the same now
Being persistent
Don't get it twisted
Wind up another name on forensic files
The wave I've been paving
Breaking your safe
Violating your space worse than a home invasion
Start wars with advance education
Better find a better replacement, I'm beyond anxious
This ain't rap, this is writing my soul to sell it to Satan
It don't matter how many stories I tell
Cause I know demons is eventually gonna drag me to hell
Gonna drag me to hell yo

[Verse 2 : Jus Allah]
I kill indiscriminately I don't have a preference
Male or female, infancy to adolescence
I cut 'em up, put the parts in the reservoir
Or I stitch them back, put the arms where the legs are
The first time that I saw a coffin I laid in it
The first pool of blood that I made I bathed in it
Sorry I didn't shave, but I'm a danger to myself
My razor isn't allowed to have a blade in it
I'm on my way to hell
I ain't religious
But I still celebrate Halloween, it's like Satan's Christmas
If I didn't work then, and Friday the 13th
It'd be hard for guys like me, to stay in business
I was killed right after I killed my assassin
I was okay dying with that as my last action
But I was brought back
On a wish, from a monkey's boy
That made something that's equally as bad happen

[Verse 3 : Madecipha]
I'll never rest till death, transcended from severed flesh
Gettin stressed whatever then I met her with severed weapons
???
Rip through eager rappers, stab her in the bitch tube
I sip booze and smoke blunts, poke sluts and keep it moving
Evil doers choose to open up they don't believe I'm human
Do this for my ??? standing in hell
Random kids will sell, understand that I'm made to dwell
???
???
Rippin axe at last, carve a target departed
I'm here to the task, got the heart of a spartan
I'm a martyr or a martian
With confidence galore
???
???
Hear the bell tolls, you will ?? with apearance now

[Verse 4 : Rypa]
When I drink ghost's blood as you pass in denial
Trying to stay trapped in their pain you revitalize
Quick from your unwise choice to survive
Hide em in the white noise faint with the cries
Can't hear a word yo, your agony is static
He’s an addict, a fanatibe, this had to be the habit
The call wouldn't trace, try to stall but he bailed
Bodies in the walls makin love to the nails
Bleed em in the pails till his density is ?
Hollowed out a rapper every century in hell
The soul that you harbor
You're meant to be a martyr
If the skin carries words I present to you whats Harvard
Vile full of orphans
Labeled them with verses
Unearthing steel born ??? from your churches
Murderous, cold blood bruh call me cobra
Thicker than a uterus in Pompeii with no drugs
Whut[Verse 1: Jus Allah]
Awww shit, my moms gonna be home before the blood dries
It's so much, it could start a fucking mudslide
So many niggas to kill, not enough time
Y'all niggas don't deserve to see the fucking sunshine
Your whole life, isn't even worth blunt rhinds
You'll die first, weak pieces are the frontline
Keep counting my kill, it could be a million
I'm the reason that you check up on yo sleeping children
I'm already high before I even smoke
I try to stay afloat, while you got a whole in your boat
Any choke coming my way, is getting poked
Wet pussy all around me now, I'm getting soaked

[Hook: Jus Allah]
This is we, this is who?
This is G-O-D, this is you
This is we, this is who?
Y'all want it to be, whatever y'all want it to be
This is me, this is you
This is we, This is G-O-D

[Verse 2: Jus Allah]
Yo, I can't spare love, for small ass niggas that I'm above
You owe me your fucking life, you can pay me in blood
Your spirit floats in the sky like arabian rugs
I fiend for seeing you dead, hate is my drug
I allow everything and all things, big and small things
I got all the rings, calling shots, pulling all the strings
You dumb motherfuckers worshipping a fallen king
You're relying on the luck that your cross brings
While I'm trying to abduct one of your offspring
Cause I go through blood like soft drinks
I could give a flying fuck what the law thinks
I'm not a savage that's in love with the hog stink
You wanna go against Allah's breed God speed
When hell freeze and your motherfucking dog reads
Carefull how you talk to gods who can part seas
One thought and your motherfucking heart bleeds

[Hook: Jus Allah]
This is me, this is you
This is we, this is who?
Y'all want it to be, whatever y'all want it to be
This is me, this is you
This is we, this is who?
This is G-O-D
This is you, this is we
This is who?
Y'all want it to be, whatever y'all want it to be
This is me, This is you
This is we, this is G-O-D

[Verse 3: Jus Allah]
All praises due, Allah unshackle me
Now it's like I got two eyes right in back of me
Now it's like 9 lives keep track of me
Nowadays I keep the fine dimes in the sack with me
Nowadays I fuck, but I don't have a hat with me
But I don't be fucking the bitches you be fucking that's nasty
Y'all savages should be displaces like hazardous waste
All you got is black space in the back of your face
I'm from the master race exactly
God of the planet, boss of the factory
Life is a test, Islam is the strategy
The father of reality, mom of the galaxy
All y'all ? of immaculate waste, have to wait
The God doesn't practice in haste
Never slacking in pace, Only lacking mistakes
Im taking off the tablecloth without cracking the plates

[Hook: Jus Allah]
This is me, this is you
This is we, this is G-O-D[Hook: Block McCloud]
We're so sick with the flow, sing along like you caught A disease
Manifest in the mirror, don't sing lip shows
We go beyond Man it's hard to believe
Guess we're blessed it's a miracle So watch
It's the Army Of Pharaohs bring your squad to its knees
Go from flesh to the spiritual Gotta pray for a miracle
Like Moses when he parted the seas
Yes, yes, it's a miracle

[King Magnetic]
They call me stupid on the stoop, I'm in the studio with Stoupe
I'm unusually loose, in the movie role it true
Ghost star, don't spar with no artist my level
Froze target, slow harvest, bull guarded by metal
So god but so ghetto, so far but so settled
Don't harbor no problems, father's slow peddle
Rosette may bloom, outsize the medal
We all got a history of violence on the record
Except for this record Babygrande, if this lady take the stand
Then my record's playing in the court like a reggae band
Still a lady's man, mag expects it
I don't get brain, I test dames' gag reflexes
Ecstasy dealer, I bag they X's
Stab 'em breathless without grabbing breakfast
I might pull ahead, or with something out with air holes
Get lower than a flat when I'm reaching where the spare goes

[Hook: Block McCloud]

[Vinnie Paz]
Yeah, yo
You can Never fuckin' test the God
The kickback of the Smith & Wesson hard
Allah think that you a devil for ingesting lard
That's a part of every lesson that he said the far
Vinnie never claimed to be a prophet, I'm a vessel God
Me and my seven Mac-11s have a special bond
Same bond when the Qu'ran give me a special calm
I wave the motherfuckin' ratchet like its Desert Storm
And use it so I can detach you from your legs and arms
Im the one who reinventin the steel
The one who took the art of rhymin', reinvented the wheel
My venom will kill
My spit game like a neurotoxin
They call me blood and guts warrior, Arturo Boxin
It's nothing anything or anyone can do to stop 'em
Matter of fact even attemptin', it's a foolish option
Anyone who try to disrespect my crew, I pop em
Or tell the rest of the Boriqua, bring the tool and ox 'em

[Hook: Block McCloud]

[Jus Allah]
Bury them and the Aryans that carried them
All stare, scared their humanitarians
Spare none of them, tear their young from them
Shun them, run them into Kingdom Come's conundrum
Hunt them, punish them, confront them
Drunken them, come undone Sunken
Summons him from the stomach of a sunless dungeon
Bludgeon them, make the chump to become consumption
Not an option to stop us, fairly obvious
They're innocuous, the despair of the populous
Get your fill of ill-gotten goddesses
Drill them with a modest amount of bottomless promises
Turn the water scarlet red, let it churn from the faucet heads
Get to detailed little trails in the carpet threads
Have 'em adamantly smack on the architect
Havin' carte blanche on the carnage, have my heart set[Verse 1: Celph Titled]
What I write in a verse is like magic tricks, Copperfield
Grab your chick, cop a feel
Cock the Glock for real, give you some cop appeal
Dynamite vest, na I ain't stressing nothing
With a smiley face sticker on my detonator button
Haters ask, "Is he bluffing or is he bugging?"
I don't know but I don't fuck with weed with the seed stuffing
What I blaze gets me oh so higher
Burn more white widow smoke than an old folks home on fire
I make change *cha ching*
I can hang a playground from a charm you should see the way my chain swings
You got the balls to diss? Won't have 'em afterwards
Cuz when I rap, contenders get killed, after all my words
I'm tired of all you rapping nerds trying to critique my shit
Like I ain't the mother fucking master of the baddest verbs
Celph Titled and the AOTP alliance will travel back in time
Smack ya, have your baby teeth flying!

[Verse 2: Jus Allah]
I am Rob Zombie, I am the Omni of dishonesty
I'm a prodigy, an atrocity
Not a lot of promise in me
Positively not a drop of modesty
My philosophy is the policy
I believe in nothing
Try teaching a beast peace and loving
Juggling, my beliefs need readjusting
My life was sticks and rocks
Kick, punch, block
It was not a box of butterscotch and shuttlecocks
I have filled a pot of mud, spilled a lot of blood
Watch the drops drip and flood, hit the top stud
I have crashed a lot of waves, dug a lot of graves
Drunk a lot of grapes, I have fucked a lot of babes
I'm do not disturb, I have punched a lot of nerds
Struck a lot of curbs, I have cut a lot of curves
You are none of the above, push come to shove
You're all mother fucking puppy lovin' country clubs!

[Verse 3: Apathy]
Y'all motherfuckers ain't running shit, y'all simply runaways
I walk the surface of the sun while you're rocking stunner shades
I'm in Hell shoving flames while you're sweating summer days
I'm the son of Satan, son of Sam, sicker some'll say
Got a flow so cold that I could blow the sun away
Even if I kick a free someone still gonna pay
You could get blasted, body in a funeral casket
And cops searching for deoxyribonucleic acid
Slay the fascists, Pharaoh fans pray for classics
Come through in Raiders jackets to make this magic
I'm a holy man, Voodoo priest, rebel that'll shoot police
You wake up from this nightmare and change your little doodoo sheets
Skeleton crusher creature from the cryo-chamber
The naughty, nasty, trashy microphone annihilator
It's AP apparently you motherfuckers missed me
Some dude tried to diss me, now that kid's history!

[Verse 4: Planetary]
Now you see the misery, I heard it needs company
Who the fuck else want to bleed in their Dungarees?
Planetary man, the evil rap Desert Eagle
Clap all your people get ready for the sequel
Needle set to vinyl, now it's time for your final thought
What's your last wish? You's a minor fine in court
Twenty five to life, rap electric chair
Spit a sicker syllable, nigga slash like the slayers hit you
Get the picture, this a Kodak moment
Mo 'Yak flowin', pussy, bet your throwback on it
I'mma break bread only if the bread ain't stale
Take young niggas to school, I heard school like jail
This is punishment government shit that you fucking with
Esoteric, I told him in "Swords Drawn" and "Dump the Clip"
Hear the "Battle Cry" piling up the dead solders
Know to "Tear it Down", we get it down, the blood runs colder!

[Verse 5: King Magnetic]
After drive-by, hop out the wheel like caged hamsters
Rage amped up, hammer time without the stage dancers
I really doubt we're killing it the same
I'm Magic before retirement, illest in the game
Diligently aim at targets without the Pizza Hut express shit
Put 'em in a long box like bread sticks
Then dip marinara or garlic, Marijuanacaholic
Carry arms like your sidekick, shoulder hold to drop kick
Your show's supposed to be mosh pits; it's only known for obnoxious
Knowingly holding most of them hostage
Know I'm close to the top ten, Coka Nostra and Rakim
Roast the most of the Pac shit
Overdose for the profit
Hold him over don't drop him, watch this
Nonsense and don't slow up the process
Hate on my project, lay you unconscious
Screaming on the phone like you won a radio contest!

[Verse 6: Vinnie Paz]
The only fucking thing I love is my long knife
The .45 cal click pow, put you on ice
Before the devil know you dead you should call Christ
All I hear is barking out of y'all, a real dog bites
If you wanna split the tribe you should call Fife
I'm the real father of creation of God's life
LeBron in the beginning of the game, yeah I toss white
Calm at the beginning of the pain, Dalai Lam-like
Then I put your fucking brain in a strong vice
Eat your liver over fava beans and some warm rice
Y'all motherfuckers head cracked like I toss dice
Vinnie taking all your money like a divorced wife![Intro: Sean Price]
Yeah...Peace to the god, Jus Allah
Doujah Raze, what up?
Snowgoons (Peace)
Boot Camp...what up?
German Lugers...aiyyo...

[Verse 1: Sean Price]
The god send you back to the Earth from which you came
Back smack Earth, wind, fire and rain
Elemental, the god get busy to instrumentals
Yeah you get busy, but that's all in your mental
I sent you a note sayin', "Son, don't rhyme"
You ain't listen, in turn he got burnt with the nine
Here's a gun, there's a gun, just...everywhere's a gun
I guess everybody pussy, scared to shoot a fair one
I will Larry Holmes your dome, Shane Mosley your homey
Felix Trinidad your dad, duke you don't know me
Riddick Bowe my ho, punch the bitch in the face
Run up on her like "Anna Mae, eat this cake."
Eat this eight, slugs inside of your mug
Got the Eagle from Balegal plus I'm puffin' on drugs
I rap for dough, no dough, no rap
Freebies get VD, yo ass get "clap," P!

[Scratch Hook] (x2)
"We got guns!" - M.O.P 'Who Got Gunz'
"Got them German Lugers, with them hollow tips" - Tony Yayo 'So Seductive'
"Guns!"
Put a fuckin' bullet in your lips, swallow this

[Verse 2: Jus Allah]
Are your parents home? You're not old enough to be left alone
May I come in? I have to use the telephone
So, what's to do 'round here for fun?
I know, show me where dad keeps the guns
Look inside the barrel, I think it's not loaded
Pull the trigger back, here, hold it
Oops, my bad, you're fuckin' dead now, look what you did
A little soul, arose up out the little kid
Are you a bad ghost or a good ghost?
Man I'm bored, I gotta go now, thanks, you've been a good host
Now time to light the good smoke
Aww shit, I left the bag of trees in my other cloak
I'm tryin' to get blazed, where the fuck is Sean P and Doujah Raze?
Each second I'm sober is like days
I need the bright green haze inside my head
So I can laugh about your silly little child that's dead

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Doujah Raze]
Take a toke, this perfect
When I fill my lungs with the smoke and start workin'
Leave the mic hurtin', murkin' on you mercenaries
You ain't got no rhymes duke, searchin' through the dictionary, keep my diction scary
Peep the visionary as I creep precision carry through the deep
I throw shade on your sleep, yeah
Come one, come all, it's the bum rush
You can find your face on the floor with your lung dust
The fuck? These mic skills are no frills
And I don't need the hype of the blow and no pills
And I can take a flight 'cross the ocean, no bills
And I can keep my height through the low with no ills
And I can build overseas with the boom
Sean P., Doujah Raze, Jus Allah in the room, yeah
Smokin' boom, gettin' regular
Tryin' to get some food for the show, madness, et cetera, yeah

[Outro: Doujah Raze]
Snowgoons...DJ Illegal
Det...We up in Germany
Deutschland, muthafuckas

"We got guns!"[Intro]
(*German sample in the background*)
Yeah, check it out; Snowgoons
You know what I'm sayin', Kamachi
Big Virt, Jus Allah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, what's the fucking deal?
The Snowgoons (Snowgoons)
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin', Kamachi
Big Virt (Yeah, yeah)
Jus Allah (Yeah, nigga)

[Verse 1: Chief Kamachi]
Yo, at the door of the lord my death gospel sings
It’s what I serve the kings, I’m an angel with dirty wings
From Hell’s church, funeral bells work
Chief, Jus and Virt, we crush the earth
We love to kill like you love the dirt
Code red alert, the guns go berserk
Bring the sensimilla and meet me after work
I’ll write another verse and send another curse
Philly to Boston, Jersey to Germany
Walk the Autobahn with a bomb screaming, “Emergency”
High like the heavens cause that’s where I prefer to be
DJ Illegal, cut, start the surgery
It’s murder in the thirty-third degree
Juju Mob, Kamach you heard you of me

(And we the rawest muhfuckin' click in the felt)
(The real motherfuckers better recognize real)
(The real motherfuckers better recognize real, real, real, real, real)

[Verse 2: Virtuoso]
Bring your whole squad we starve 'em, fuck it, who wants some?
Pawn 'em like the spectre of death we reppin' Boston
Smash y’all motherfuckers, you can’t touch us
The flow fill your ears 'till your skull and brain rupture
Pain slashin' cut you, get the cat of nine tails
Fills the rhyme grill, stab your heart with nine nails
You faggots spittin' fabrications, figments of imagination
You won’t get the picture until I flip and smash your face in
Throw you down a flight of stairs, stab you with a Viking spear
Your whole cipher’s scared cause they know the Titan’s here
The church clothes blood-stainin' 'em when I’m aiming them
Spittin' metal that’ll penetrate your cranium
Tried saving them, but fuck that, now I’m maimin' 'em
Mutilation shootin' for God and making moves for Satan
Next I’m breaking makin' his body abandon his spirit
Started swingin' on you motherfuckers like Manny Ramirez

(The real motherfuckers better recognize real, real, real)

[Verse 3: Jus Allah]
Return your motherfucking soul before my next blunt gets rolled
I eat you motherfuckers whole before the blood gets cold
Truth be told, you talk like a two years old
Same shit you wanna hold like the purest of gold
When my rhyme begins everything that’s on your mind ends
Each line from divine's like vitamins
Every message from Allah is like medicine
Every one of them could purify the Devil’s sins
Fuckin' fool, you probably flunked pre-school
We ain’t equals, I ain’t readable
You’re one step above your own mother feeding you
Unbelievable, dumb enough to be illegal
You couldn’t get this high without a fucking needle
And a fuckin' supply to fry three people

[Outro]
(Like M.O.P., nigga, I'll mash you out)
(And we the rawest muhfuckin' click in the felt)
(The real motherfuckers better recognize real)
(You're fuckin' with the wrong clan and the wrong man)
(Real motherfuckers better recognize real, real, real, real)
(Real motherfuckers better recognize real, real, real, real, real)[Verse 1: Jus Allah]

I am deadly
I am into death heavily -Desperately
I am dead presently
Death is best of me
I've accepted Death as destiny;
I have been blessed excessively -ineffectively
I'm with death indefinitely; I don't have a requisite expectancy;
I don't have a preference or discrepancy
I have dealt with death and it's complexity
I have dealt directly with it's excellency
I'm selectively in ecstasy

I live in a cramped cell where ants dwell, where the land swells
It's a handy mans hell, damn well!
I don't care for Samwell or Amstel: I like maximum amounts
Half an ounce, blackouts, and Maxwell house
I don't like jazz or smash mouth
I don't like playing cat and mouse
I'm a mad house
I am never badmouthed
I am either passed out or dragged out
I am either the couch or the cat house[Jus Allah]
Blood, death, sex and crimes
Reminds me of some of my most memorable times
Stand placed, those were the good ol' days
Ain't shit changed, still maintain my old ways
Upgrade, livin' like kings, gettin' nice things
Build and destroy, everything live brings
Killin' for sport, niggas ain't as real as I thought
I'm just angry, lot of hate still in my heart
Playin' my part, rhymes like Christ is dark
One dart, and the crisis starts
We stumble amongst the path, that the righteous walk
You not worthy of the math, that the science is taught
Peep the system, with the wisdom, even if you cause friction
Give a fuck, main focus is Allah's mission
Take your cross off, ask for forgiveness
First can't prove, God, the man witness

[Evil Dead]
Got an L, kid, nah, cool if you dig
Buildin' off the two, show and prove when I spit
Buddha fist, tell the truth, school is a bid
A tool to condition, how we choose to live
Use the shit, the jewel, leave 'em, fools should get
Death don't apply, still we fuse to get
It's ludicrous, who would of thought the shoes'll fit
Feed 'em food for thought, before I chew these kids
Ya'll left Kathy, but y'all can't approach Sally
Frankie had a black with cats in back allies
Black gats strapped to the barney
I be god damn if the man won't buy me
Shots of Bacardi, splash of coffee
Seven in the morning, going to crash the party
Probably blowing lines of oxy
Allah U Akbar, for my mind and body

*samples scratched up*

[Evil Dead]
Spit science, eyes of a mystic spell
Playin' God, with crimes like Christmas carols
Shit's terrible, but the blind get hit with arrows
Pickin' off the hero's, like fish in the barrel
Spit parables, compared with the knowledge of devils
Each claim me, now I'mma feel lost in hell
Spark the L, clearly I don't want y'all help
Look up in the mirror, I saw God himself
We rock well, we will never bow to your king
With corpse selling, I knock at any coward who sings
Court cases, got me coming back with more things
Died and went to court, for what I got in my northface
Short changed, faith in every word Allah sing
For all dame, call at all events, I foreseen
Clouded up your head like morphine
Raw to the core, your brain absorbs the lost links

[Jus Allah]
Allah, father or lord, with sharpened sword
First cry, hit the redbull's eye in the dartboard
Leave when motherfuckers playin' harps and chords
Fatal scars, this year we taking ours
Even if it's taking food out your baby jaws
License to God, giving all praise to Allah, my favorite part
Fuck y'all, your CD's collect dust balls
Kill you niggas today, before the sun falls
This is where I thrive, trynna revive the crime
Proof real niggas get they lie
This no motherfuckin' image, balance the limits
Infinite, no start for a fuckin' finish
Niggas nowhere involved in God's business
Best friends with the least to fuck with star witness
Motherfuckers deserve they ugly ass heads spinning
Only good fuck the devils, is a dead man

*samples scratched up*Yeah yeah yall hear it, motherfuckin Doap Nixon. Namsayin?
The cat with the lil kid voice but the grown man aim nigga

[Doap Nixon]
Yo whats the difference between the mentally gifted
And the ignorant gettin splifted?
It's that the ignorant could never get this
When i come like 50 egyptians gettin snipted
Leavin the features, hands lit up with life's pieces
Christians forever point fingers on who the beast is
But Doap's thesis: is it peace or is it grief
While you grit your teeth at the arabs in the middle east
Who be on they knees, slow motion as parallel
But my city done fell, victimized to who's the real
You count the chickens before they hatch
And count the thump of my steel, Move amongst the wise
Footprints and rough hoods (hoodlums) jellin (jealous)
You live money, you dumb shook, plus your crew
Yo we philly niggas, I say peace to bust at you
Never a disgusting crew, for lust for the jewels

[Jus Allah]
I keep blunts of cess in between my jaws
I keep chunks of flesh underneath my claws
Animal-like, rape a lady Aphrodite
I watch people bleed to tease my appetite
Slice your mug, we hand and knife thugs
That's so harcore, we banned from Fight Club
Raw, we're nightcrawlin blood alcoholics
Yall only hope is wooden stakes and garlic
Islamic, thinkin on a higher logic
Dressed in Arab garments on flyin carpets
Takin me to hovering starships
With high-powered aeronautics, to ride across cosmics
Lost in space, I pause to meditate
My souls energy causes walls to shake
Niggas stand clear when my land get spread
Cause my scarecrows got real klansmen heads

*Hook*
We came thru, invading your village with more weapons
Spies like us make you hit the floor for tension
Squad reppin', dont step into our section
We hard hittin', while you watch the god spittin

[Planet]
Yo I walk like egyptians around your pyramids
Here's a kid, that spits raw lyrics and splits your wig
Transform my right arm to hydrogen bombs
For my niggas who burn weed till they lighters is gone
Next level, complex rebel without a cause
Sleepy hollow, choppin your heads, riding a horse
The size of my sword, makes you see the eyes of the lord
In my den with a pen waiting for lions to roar
Loud cries, innocent beings being abducted
Alien life, Jesus Christ has constructed
Firewater, brought by the design author
Who holds the globe and patrols in a flying saucer
Mic enforcer, from Outerspace, yo the iller team
King Size and Doap Nix create a ill regime
I split the seam and emerge from a deep corral
And stay with respect like Pun's rest in peace mural

[Vinnie Paz]
Yo we the rawest rappers
If you started we gon' draw with clappers
There's no tommorrow cause we horror and we sharp as cactus
Thas why your jaw shatters, while my floor splatters
I do my dirt all by my lonely with the God Barakus
If you barkin at us, we dump shells
I dent em and bend em and dead em and send em to Hell!
You'll probly yell! you should cry for your dying wives
I severed em with several flying iron knives
Look in the lion's eyes.. and see darkness
Vinnie Paz, animal thug, just straight heartless
YALL GARBAGE, the gods remain conscious
Think Vinnie Paz is sick son? he nauseous
Cobra clutch, I'll blow your midn while you roll a dutch
And leave your children more Holier than Jehovah's touch
You know it's us, dead is how you'll find me
With money in the bank like Fox had in ????

*hook*

Paz:
Yow.. Yo Its Vinnie Paz baby. Takin yall mafackers to war
Doap Nix, the god Jus Allah, Plantetary baby
We takin yall mafackas to war, rippin hearts out. Namean? Namsayin?
Jedi Mind forever baby. What the fuckin deal?
Stoupe on the track u'namsayin? We bodyin motherfuckers
Whats the fuckin deal? Severin heads baby. FUCK YALL!(...Give a fuck, nigga)

[Verse 1: In2ition]

[TO BE ADDED]

[Hook]
(I'm a fucking nightmare: young, black and just don't give a fuck)
(I just wanna get high and live it up)
(A nightmare: young, black and just don't give a fuck)
(I just wanna get high)
(A white nightmare: young, black and just don't give a fuck)
(I just wanna get high and live it up)
(A nightmare: young, black and just don't give a fuck, nigga)

[Verse 2: The Etherealist]
I'm pulling scalps off; it's stitches for bitches who run their mouths off
I pound whores with dicks and fists; I'm a outlaw
Suffocate you in your asshole: craft murders from metaphors
There's millions of years between us like the T-Rex and the stegosaurs
Inventing wars to mutilate your children
When the hydro-bomb drops, better escape the building
Catch a feeling in my presence and you headed for heaven
Deaden your brethren in a second at a Seven-Eleven
Forget a weapon: I'm spitting a venom; a Armageddon
I deafen; I'm dropping bodies like The Great Depression
I'm fucking bedding six-feet-deep and emcee in the area
I'm scarier than a fucking rabid pit-bull terrier
Bury ya, sever ya, shred, disconnect ya, vivisect ya
You're fucking with the dissector: better forget about Lecter
Ate so many pigs' families that the po-po shut the case off
You wanna role with my best, you better expect to cut your face off
(Try peeling off your face)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: In2ition & (The Etherealist)]

If I ever had a daughter, I think I'd have to abort her
If she grew up to be a stunner, it'd be incestuous cock slaughter
(Rock snorter; the hoarder of infectious block-walkers)
(I fuck 'em with forceps; force 'em to sex in toilet water)
I'm not here to impress or transgress: I'm here to depress
Oppress, aggress, possess; protest my wickedness
(Sickness; children impaled on my picket fence)
(Compress your sket's flesh through a fucking Play Doh press)
(You Legolas: I literally leave lesbians limbless)
Take photos of them undressed: use it as stimulus
(Instruments of violence; eyelids stapled open)
Permitting their silence, I bid them to motion
(These hoes getting the hose again unless the fucking bucket holds the lotion)
They chose to pose as posers but soon their spines will be broken
(Lines of the cocaína; fevers for foetuses; cleavers in beaver's clits)
Practitioners of treason-ness; mind's as a hyena's is
Creators of hater's limp penises

[Hook]
