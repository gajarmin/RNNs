[Intro: Kay Slay]
G-Force (what's up Slay?)
I need you to make a hit for me (talk to me)
Four suspects (who?)
Busta Rhymes, Layzie Bone (who else?)
Twista, Jaz-O (I got ya)
There they go, take the shot!
Take the shot! DAMN!

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
When I come and I hop and I skip and I rhyme
And I dumb and I drop and I spit and I shine
Ay-ay-ay nigga what you really wanna do?
You ain't knowin that I'm comin to take what's mine
Every time I come to hit'cha
With a little bit of killa
Better know that you can never
Never see me little nigga
While I'm at the TOP
I will never STOP
When a nigga POP
See the way I run it, and leave a nigga bitter
Y'all know when I do my thing and I bang
Bidi-boom with a bomb and a BING!
Everybody know that when it comes to the shit I gotta spit
Motherfucker better crown me KING!
With a passion and a lot of action
See the way ya grab 'em, HOW YOU DO IT!
Then they wanna ask him
How a nigga smash 'em
See the way ya have 'em, DRAG 'EM TO IT!
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey-HEY!
Now you gotta know what a nigga do all day
Count bread make a nigga wanna bounce heads when I drop heat in these streets, okay?
You shitty with a get'cha gimmick
And I hope a lot of niggas live near a clinic
It don't really matter who you wanna ask about me
Cause I be the fiercest with it
While I'm givin you the final chapter
With a lot of laughter
See the way I capture
Everybody probably tellin you the same shit you don't really wanna come after!
Now I suggest you listen whenever you hear that the beat up in the buildin
Trust me, this is not the place for you to bring yo' children

[Verse 2: Layzie Bone]
The B-O-N-E we got plenty of flows;
From Cleveland, Ohio we rollin on vogues
They told me this record was only for pros
So Layzie gon' get in M.V.P. I suppose
Foes slammin them Cadillac do's
My story they caught has never been told
Sit back while I'm tellin this thuggish we blaze
Forever I'm young and'll never get old
Poppin a bottle of Rosé when I rolls
Smell the aroma, just follow your nose
We thug on the corner from night 'til the sun up
You run up get done up, I'll let it explode
Blow only where gangstas roll, so
Homie we smash around and we crash collide
Whoever don't wanna be foes, oh
O.G. status, still got money up under the mattress
Nigga come get it I'll stick like cactus,
Money so tall those niggas need ladders
Try to come close but they never could match us
So catch us, we the masters
Y'all already know how we do it on the Clair
Never compare we livin' on stretchers
Willin to bet ya, when I twist and bust
Nigga come through with Twist and Bust
Nigga been famous they know to aim it
They spittin my languange, "Adrenaline Rush"
Feminine niggas that been on a rush
Back to the dust we winnin the clutch
Just slipped through to spit some real thug shit!

[Verse 3: Twista]
Now I be the coldest on the island, country or on the peninsula
Hit them with the venom and then I'mma
Disintegrate 'em or fade 'em, fuck 'em cause I hate 'em,
I'm hot if you not check the temperature
Mayday one Kay Slay, drop the bomb on 'em when they put me on the track and I'mma
Show 'em who was out when I make 'em go and commit suicide dressed like a Phantom or
Do and I'm about to get dinner
I'm about to open the do'
Cause I'm dope with the flow
Never know how flow was the 'dro
I'mma eat a bitch up and I hope for some mo'
So long is the poem, I'm never a ho
You can go check the portfolio
Kay Slay 'em just after fuck at you and then I'mma stick 'em, you know we can go
I'm cold so go get your coat
This be the season for niggas that's sneezin and snoozin
And if you keep testin me you gon' be catchin a beatin and bruisin - what's up?
Look at the mojo and look at the swag, and look at all the vernacular
Things I be doin cause I'mma stay infamous so they be callin me Dracula
Oops I mean Blackula when I'm attackin ya
Pullin up on 'em up in the new Acura
Or new pre-Camaro or new super Lego with the Pinot Grigio seats
I see when you niggas be hatin, so the next time when you see me don't speak
Now you know not to send me no beat
Cause I'mma kill it
And murder anybody That'll wanna get it
Where they wanna get up in it cause I be the realest
I'm a menace all the way up to the finish
Make an enemy diminish
When I get up in the battle even if it gotta be on the block
2010 hip-hop, the shit don't stop

[Layzie Bone]
Just slipped through to spit some real thug shit!

[Verse 4: Jaz-O]
What can it be?
Rappers and thuggin on beats
None of 'em keepin it street
Look at them calves, all of them wanna be bulls
None of 'em ready for beef
What about me?
Been through the pain
Sorted the lames, keep it the same
Skillful syllables kill
My rhymin technique is impeccable still
Anybody ever wanna run up
Will get done up in a hurry
Got a flurry
I'mma hunt 'em for the come up
With a bang you better run from the one until you permanently feel it
I will live it, idiots gettin it
"The Originator," gotta keep it greater
Keep the fader for the haters
Nigga real for real
The all-time thriller, ready rockin the death of it definite
On it cookin and cheffin it (ooh!)
Takin over the world
Made of with your girl
Motherfucker recognize the nigga Hugh Heff'in it
Doin what you never did at double time, triple shot president
Ain't nobody better in the residence
Cream of the crop, seein' it stop
Over the top, bringin the soul makin it pop
Got a old school banger make you do the wop
Got a Louisville slugger make you diddy-bop
Ever incredible gotta keep it way ahead of you
Screamin at my niggas in the clink doin federal
No trip, no travesty
I call the lick now I'm up like anti-gravity
Spit words from the brain like charity
If hip-hop was a broad she'd marry me
Gotta keep it gutter, gotta get the bread, gotta get the butter
Make it hot, you can toast word to mother

Straight muthafuckas

[50 Cent]
That's the sound of the man, cockin' that thang - that thaaaang
That's the sound of the man, clappin' that thang - thaaang
Yo, in my hood we was taught not to say who shot ya
See the flash, you heard the shot, you feel the burnin', I got ya
Say a prayer for me if you care for me cuz I'm on the edge
I'm finna put a shell in a nigga head
I rock a lot of ice, I dare you to scheme on it
The fifth got a rubber grip and a beam on it
Homie that took the hit on me couldn't shoot
They say I'm skinny now, but I look big in a coupe
My cousin Uzi out in L.A. done tripped and do the sets again
Got shot the fuck up tryin' to rob the wrong Mexicans
I write my lifestyle, y'all niggas is cheaters
Your lines come from feds, felons and don diva
Oh you the black hand of death, then why your name ain't preacher
If you a pimp like Ken why them hoes don't treat ya?
If you wanna ball like Kirk, now shorty let me teach ya
This flow's God sent, it's bound to reach ya

[Hook]
Problem child, I'm familiar with problems
I know how to solve em
Semi-automatic, luger tray, revolve em
Shoot em up, rob em
In the hood we starvin, you don't want problems
Problem child

[Bridge] [Singing]
And why can't you be man enough
To tell me where you're comin' from

[50 Cent]
They say you can never repay the price for takin' a man's life
I'm in debt with Christ, I done did that twice
I'm nice, y'all niggas can't hang wit fifty
+Blaaat+, y'all niggas can't bang wit fifty
For every bar in the rhyme, there's a shell and a nine
For every stone in the cross, there's a bitch I tossed
See the wounds in my skin they from a war of course
You can check C-N-N for the "War Report"
See the drama got me ridin' with a sawed-off shottie
Catch you at the light, I blow ya ass off the Ducati
Man, niggas ain't gon' do me like Sammy did Gotti
I'll do it myself, I don't need no help
Give me a knife, I'll get rid of your neighborhood bully
Give me a minute, I'll take a fuckin' car with a pully
See the hood is the deepest stole my innocence young
Niggas jumped me cuz they couldn't beat me one-on-one

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[50 Cent]
I must've broke a mirror at three and had bad luck for seven
Cuz pops slid, mommy died before I turned eleven
This cities split 'posed to let black cats cross your path
The footprints in the sand is Satan carryin' your ass
I got "God Understand Me" tattooed in my skin
When I die, come back, I'mma tattoo it again
I'm the young buck that let the gun buck
Roll the window down and say: "'Wassup", niggas get ready to duck
My heart is a house homie, If you don't live here
Nigga believe me when I say I don't care
Muslims mix a lot, God studied they lessons
Even when my luck's hard I still count my blessings
See that look in my eye, ya betta keep on steppin'
Spent time on my cell floor, to sharpen my weapon
If you pussy I'mma smell you when you come around here
Them boys in Pelican Bay couldn't live in my tier

[Hook][Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Reporting live from where reporters die
Newscasters coming too early witnessing homocides
Pearly gates forming in the sky as we wait for your suit and tie
I tailor-made it for you then told Khalifa he loves you
I'm really stuck on this bumpy ride
Highway to hell 'less I flip through a demon's TV-guide
An angel said he've seen me fry
Ducking bullets
I promise I couldn't stop the work my niggas have put in
Your brains is banana pudding
I'm looking for trouble, looking for hustle
I'm a grinder, choppas in the path finder
I ain't no killa, I ain't no drug dealer
I'm a real nigga with real emotions that stand behind a
Brick wall, you knock it down then I'm forced to align ya
With the stars of Venus and Jupiter
You ain't ain't gangsta, you fooling us
The government don't know what to do with us
Internal affairs investigate while LAPD speculate
Crooked cops on my bumper dumping 'til I'm first 48
I can smell a snake a mile away because they reek hate
But any anaconda can die on a weekday
Wikipedia speeding up my career like I've been here
And I don't fuck with these fuck rappers cause they been weird
Been on my dick, get addicted to dying quick
Grab a dictionary, my styles vary, my words flip
Grab a cemetery and jump in it you jive turkey
Watching me through goggles, I throw hollows at James Worthy
Spin your head like an owl, I'm wild, I drive Fergies
That's that white thing, let my nuts & Mic hang
No one ever knows the drama that I might bring
Chilling with the drama king, but this ain't Broadway, mane
Armed forces, more fortune, alarm Porsches
Bitch gorgeous, bomb head like Civil War and
Y'all snorin', we tourin' and bottle pourin'
Model scorin', cheat the game with fair warnings

[Verse 2: Schoolboy Q]
Living filthy to get it, fuck writing lyrics
High status in traffic
Bad energy, getting static
Day and night like Gladys, Kid Cudi
Man on the moon, feeling managed like (Drama king) fuck a planet
Go'n with it, ashing ashes on critics
Twenty racks then we split it up, feeling like a million bucks
Bust hoes, run into sluts, keep it G, that shit a must
Creeping in that Honda Civ', ain't mine, it ain't his
Written down, spare the kids, back to the crib ya handle biz
Lunchables and sandwiches, dude dog be mad as shit
Visualize the shit I kick, never heard of witnesses
Better make sure I'm innocent, 18 shots at 3 niggas
6 a piece, hell of a life, done for the night, throw up they Nikes
? precise, for the cheese they call us mice, no rats
Everywhere is a trap, talking 'bout that white girl
Feeling good to be black, ya whole hood I seize that
Breaking down the (?), fuck all that feedback
Gone by the morning, I landed soon as you yawning
Feeling like I'm Conan, here to fuck up your whole program
Who can fuck with us, no man, Hiiipower slow dance
Kick a funky toe jam, gold rapper, that's trojan
Slinging rock erosion, and yo bitch be open
Easily I be chosen, comparing me I'm like who them
Back to back tracks, running laps
With dictionary words on top of verbs to prove that they wack
Pressing weight to the max
Hurt your man like swinging ax, release it let 'em chat
Man amongst boys but these toys aren't his racks
Itunes that shittin stacks, shitting stacks while writing raps, rap!
Looking humble, let them react
Too many bars, not tit for tat, super hits like having bats
Swinging for the fences, in the trenches making a difference
Driven like a engine, directing me through my fucking mission

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
West coast, east side, my stomping ground, come around
Get your ass flatlined from niggas of that cracklines
Welcome to this wildlife, steady living a wild life
Trying to beat all competitors and predators, they proud knights
Nightfall; lay low. Sunrise; so live
Better watch your front-end, your back better have four eyes
So high: satellite, smoking on that bomb, nigga
Dynamite, you acting like a pussy, you no friend of mines
Better yet, fuck friends, surrounded by my real niggas
They cock back, they see caps, they peal quicker, real killers
Real business, it's never personal, Jack, remember that
Fuck up my money then I'mma fuck over your universe
I'm shooting first, never last, gotta stay sharp like shattered glass
In a fast lane with a bad dame, man, this bitch from Trinidad
Fuck her hard, then send her home, it's time to start my routine
In the streets, with the heat, you don't rhyme, you don't eat
Pockets fat like obese, it's hard to be so lowkey
Niggas acting like they know me, fuck around and be the police
Trust no nigga nor a bitch
Nigga, I'm so OG like 8 tracks and tape decks
25, but I'm straight fed
Got a old soul, I'm so throwed, so raw with this rap thing
Kay Slay, go tell 'em dawg, niggas know I'm crack, mane
Kill 'em with my flow, everytime it's a deathblow
You fuck rappers stay on your toe, we sharks in the water
Get that ass ate up, straight up, the worlds ours
Top Dawg ENT, HiiiPower
We buy flowers then we send 'em to your studio
Cause everytime we in that bitch, homie, it's a funeral
I have to slow it down so you can hear me close
Yeah, I'm nice with the bars
Late night sliding pipe in your broad
Her pussy tighter than them skinnies on the jerk dancers
Send her back with no panties
Jay motherfucking Rock[Eminem - talking]
I'd be a horrible mixtape DJ
I would be really fuckin bad
THIS IS MOTHERFUCKIN EMINEM!

And your listenin to the motherfuckin easy listenin sounds, or whatever
Clear your fuckin ear wax out
This is motherfuckin DJ Kay Slay
The Drama King and it goes a little somethin like this
Yo turn that click off, alright

(*beat to Eminem, Obie Trice & 50 Cent's "Love Me" starts*)
Look...

[Eminem]
My music is soothin', but it's also been proven
That it can put you in the mood to jump out of ya car while it's movin'
You've been waitin' on this moment, my sermon
Is like a omen; I'm servin', I'm Erick Sermon
I saw the window was open and I jumped through it
My shit, if you don't get pumped to it
I quit; here's my rhyme book, go 'head and thumb through it
And pick what you want from it, rummage 'til ya find somethin'
You can use to jump someone and roll up bumpin'
I'm constantly coppin' over you, squattin'; shit has gotten
To the point where I'm ain't even writin' no more, I'm just jottin'
This is chicken scratch; shit is sickenin', I've been kickin' ass
Off bullshit throwaway rhymes, pick a batch
I live for the love of rap, you crazy?
I've made beats for Jay-Z for free, page me
You need a beat... you Canibus? Then it's Dre's fee
You Kay Slay? The fee's waived; I stay beefin'
With JD to the day Dre two-ways me
That it's okay to stop blazin' him
Oops, I put it out
I apologize now, it's too late, G
It's on tape, and the tape leaked
"Say what you say," motherfucker!
Drama King, Kay Slay motherfucker!
We dictate these mixtapes motherfucker!

To have you next to me

To not have you by my side

[Verse: Nas]
You a brave girl? I'm a Braveheart

Sex in rangers, parked on dangerous blocks
You like it when the strangers watch
Im' looking out for cops, you a girl with no fear
People put ya hands in the air for the GQ man of the year
That Bentley, upholstry Leather
The leather that be up in the coats I wear
Wherever I go so there ya have it
Cashmere fabrics, never caught in last years garments
Holsters under armpits, chauffers and the charms lit
And a coat is holding on the Don's wrist
She got the ill Will chain on
Turqouise boots saying "God's Son"
This the theme song

[Hook]

[Verse: Baby]
You know the size of this shit, I flips it quickly
Lose this trouble 'fore these people get with me
Holla at my hoes cause I dip my bitches

Worldwide Rider in a Benz with a spoiler
In your city tear yo mall up
Pimp fly bitches and tear their walls up
Dress nice I'm super neat
Ice on white wit 3's on her feat
Worldwide Rider, I'm coast to coast

That's the sound of the man, clappin' that thang - thaaang
Yo, in my hood we was taught not to say who shot ya
See the flash, you heard the shot, you feel the burnin', I got ya
Say a prayer for me if you care for me cuz I'm on the edge
I'm finna put a shell in a nigga head
I rock a lot of ice, I dare you to scheme on it
The fifth got a rubber grip and a beam on it
Homie that took the hit on me couldn't shoot
They say I'm skinny now, but I look big in a coupe
My cousin Uzi out in L.A. done tripped and do the sets again
Got shot the fuck up tryin' to rob the wrong Mexicans
I write my lifestyle, y'all niggas is cheaters
Your lines come from feds, felons and don diva
Oh you the black hand of death, then why your name ain't preacher
If you a pimp like Ken why them hoes don't treat ya?
If you wanna ball like Kirk, now shorty let me teach ya
This flow's God sent, it's bound to reach ya

[Hook]
Problem child, I'm familiar with problems
I know how to solve em
Semi-automatic, luger tray, revolve em
Shoot em up, rob em
In the hood we starvin, you don't want problems
Problem child

[Bridge] [Singing]
And why can't you be man enough
To tell me where you're comin' from

[50 Cent]
They say you can never repay the price for takin' a man's life
I'm in debt with Christ, I done did that twice
I'm nice, y'all niggas can't hang wit fifty
+Blaaat+, y'all niggas can't bang wit fifty
For every bar in the rhyme, there's a shell and a nine
For every stone in the cross, there's a bitch I tossed
See the wounds in my skin they from a war of course
You can check C-N-N for the "War Report"
See the drama got me ridin' with a sawed-off shottie
Catch you at the light, I blow ya ass off the Ducati
Man, niggas ain't gon' do me like Sammy did Gotti
I'll do it myself, I don't need no help
Give me a knife, I'll get rid of your neighborhood bully
Give me a minute, I'll take a fuckin' car with a pully
See the hood is the deepest stole my innocence young
Niggas jumped me cuz they couldn't beat me one-on-one

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[50 Cent]
I must've broke a mirror at three and had bad luck for seven
Cuz pops slid, mommy died before I turned eleven
This cities split 'posed to let black cats cross your path
The footprints in the sand is Satan carryin' your ass
I got "God Understand Me" tattooed in my skin
When I die, come back, I'mma tattoo it again
I'm the young buck that let the gun buck
Roll the window down and say: "'Wassup", niggas get ready to duck
My heart is a house homie, If you don't live here
Nigga believe me when I say I don't care
Muslims mix a lot, God studied they lessons
Even when my luck's hard I still count my blessings
See that look in my eye, ya betta keep on steppin'
Spent time on my cell floor, to sharpen my weapon
If you pussy I'mma smell you when you come around here
Them boys in Pelican Bay couldn't live in my tier

[Hook][Verse 1: Ghostface]
Yeah! Come on! I know many boney niggas that knock big niggas out
Force MC's to write more when my pen is out
Indian Gym's pedestal prince sit on thrones
Crack bones hardly pay back loans
Fuck a Maybach I hash back a three G stone
One bitch, four fifth, rubber grip, never hidden it's shown
This is for dirt balm niggas wingworm babies who smell like piss in school
Smoke wombs, rob and tote tools
Jail and poke fools, bash niggas in the head
With forties after thatm shake your hand and get more brew
Please be at ease God, fuck the disease God
You rap niggas front on me, I'm a squeeze God
Headline, man get sprayed by retard
Ghostly thing, he left behind the red clark
His gun bark up big trees
Made his best with a bomb and fluid, olivie oil and mint leaves
When y'all bag up your fuckin bottles is empty
We serve glaciers that's why the fiends is friendly

[Hook]
Streetrunner gotta stop runnin sometime

[Verse 2: Kool G. Rap]
Then, uh, what! Bread ridiculous, heads want a whiff of this
Glad for hypocrites layin back and triple this
Model heads hollow heads and the nickel fifth
When I juggle fuck a double nigga flip with chips
Sets I cripple this let a nigga nipple kiss
The scene'll hit or miss I'll show you where you ticklish
The more iceyed out need to bang your wifey out
She like the way my Rose Gold chain swing my thing bang
Know I got niggas in Sing Sing like Ving Rhames
I'm not a nigga that maintain the same dames
I'm steady switchin up, Chevy truck glistened up
I'm not them other suckers motherfuckers listen up
This nigga riffin what, who the fuck is kissin up
You own the cake you'll get ducktaped listen up
The goon trace when they say Buck lift 'em up
New York plates on the interstate shiftin up, what

[Verse 3: Raekwon]
Aiyyo! Squeezin your hammer jammin it

Clark whip up call up Sammy
I clash with major paper my blood is an alligator
My style is a mile away from y'all niggas Sal of haters
We came to take it over my plane is delayed I drove up with hangers and back up rovers
Movin through the rain with golfers
Who carry heavy armor with bangers and rep regardless
Chef will play the Jeffrey Dahmer dig you when I'm in your garments
Y'all niggas is 'spicious, supercrabfragilistic
Niggas that I'm against is ginzu 'em with the quickness
Rappers is pussy so soft, mad gushy
Go north, your your dad pushed me schooled him cause he had a pussy

[Verse 4: Lord Tariq]
Lord the borough's mainframe, I remain the same chain
Lames play the game to gain cock and aim the than thang (Bang!!!)
I let the thang rang then became the king of caine
Gettin chains slingin thangs no different than Richard mane
Call a order off the water y'all native New Yorker
Caught a case the law was lacin y'all with eights and raw the states applaud
Facin it for sure with just the taste the states and laws
Made to degrade my age limit diminish my cause
Ain't nothin to us nothin move us tightly knitten up and through us
Type of shit the hype the gripe I got despite my life is it
And what you talk is what we walk
And what we up we love this spot
Place none above me of course faithfully yours
I hate when it warms, rapin the law
Came through the door with a cape and cane
Sayin my name wavin the four
Displayin the false aim and then buss claim it was yours
Ain't no team hotter than Team Saga sign the Lord!!!

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Big Daddy Kane]
Who wanna feel the fire from me fuckin with the don
Just save the Ying Yang for Lil' Jon kid it's on
Got the coffin case Slay they try to connect
They know that, Stuyvesant vet a be the livest we get rid of
Greasy is from where the sleezy is from
Devious one, and anytime you need me it's done
Some talkin off the yap trip and what they gonna do?
But know they couldn't find the fuckin heart with John Q
I'm hear to warn you, we vouched your plans
My name is sent to 'mounts of millions you get thousand fans
Little fly by night nigga that's about to land
Let me take the shit up out of your hands
Understand, your games won't work can't hide your own jerk
And any technicalities I'm pullin on skirts
Beside the mink jacket that be where the chrome lurks
So make sure my paper write like we checkin homework, come on

[Hook]

We out!!![Intro: Kay Slay]
G-Force (what's up Slay?)
I need you to make a hit for me (talk to me)
Four suspects (who?)
Busta Rhymes, Layzie Bone (who else?)
Twista, Jaz-O (I got ya)
There they go, take the shot!
Take the shot! DAMN!

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
When I come and I hop and I skip and I rhyme
And I dumb and I drop and I spit and I shine
Ay-ay-ay nigga what you really wanna do?
You ain't knowin that I'm comin to take what's mine
Every time I come to hit'cha
With a little bit of killa
Better know that you can never
Never see me little nigga
While I'm at the TOP
I will never STOP
When a nigga POP
See the way I run it, and leave a nigga bitter
Y'all know when I do my thing and I bang
Bidi-boom with a bomb and a BING!
Everybody know that when it comes to the shit I gotta spit
Motherfucker better crown me KING!
With a passion and a lot of action
See the way ya grab 'em, HOW YOU DO IT!
Then they wanna ask him
How a nigga smash 'em
See the way ya have 'em, DRAG 'EM TO IT!
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey-HEY!
Now you gotta know what a nigga do all day
Count bread make a nigga wanna bounce heads when I drop heat in these streets, okay?
You shitty with a get'cha gimmick
And I hope a lot of niggas live near a clinic
It don't really matter who you wanna ask about me
Cause I be the fiercest with it
While I'm givin you the final chapter
With a lot of laughter
See the way I capture
Everybody probably tellin you the same shit you don't really wanna come after!
Now I suggest you listen whenever you hear that the beat up in the buildin
Trust me, this is not the place for you to bring yo' children

[Verse 2: Layzie Bone]
The B-O-N-E we got plenty of flows;
From Cleveland, Ohio we rollin on vogues
They told me this record was only for pros
So Layzie gon' get in M.V.P. I suppose
Foes slammin them Cadillac do's
My story they caught has never been told
Sit back while I'm tellin this thuggish we blaze
Forever I'm young and'll never get old
Poppin a bottle of Rosé when I rolls
Smell the aroma, just follow your nose
We thug on the corner from night 'til the sun up
You run up get done up, I'll let it explode
Blow only where gangstas roll, so
Homie we smash around and we crash collide
Whoever don't wanna be foes, oh
O.G. status, still got money up under the mattress
Nigga come get it I'll stick like cactus,
Money so tall those niggas need ladders
Try to come close but they never could match us
So catch us, we the masters
Y'all already know how we do it on the Clair
Never compare we livin' on stretchers
Willin to bet ya, when I twist and bust
Nigga come through with Twist and Bust
Nigga been famous they know to aim it
They spittin my languange, "Adrenaline Rush"
Feminine niggas that been on a rush
Back to the dust we winnin the clutch
Just slipped through to spit some real thug shit!

[Verse 3: Twista]
Now I be the coldest on the island, country or on the peninsula
Hit them with the venom and then I'mma
Disintegrate 'em or fade 'em, fuck 'em cause I hate 'em,
I'm hot if you not check the temperature
Mayday one Kay Slay, drop the bomb on 'em when they put me on the track and I'mma
Show 'em who was out when I make 'em go and commit suicide dressed like a Phantom or
Do and I'm about to get dinner
I'm about to open the do'
Cause I'm dope with the flow
Never know how flow was the 'dro
I'mma eat a bitch up and I hope for some mo'
So long is the poem, I'm never a ho
You can go check the portfolio
Kay Slay 'em just after fuck at you and then I'mma stick 'em, you know we can go
I'm cold so go get your coat
This be the season for niggas that's sneezin and snoozin
And if you keep testin me you gon' be catchin a beatin and bruisin - what's up?
Look at the mojo and look at the swag, and look at all the vernacular
Things I be doin cause I'mma stay infamous so they be callin me Dracula
Oops I mean Blackula when I'm attackin ya
Pullin up on 'em up in the new Acura
Or new pre-Camaro or new super Lego with the Pinot Grigio seats
I see when you niggas be hatin, so the next time when you see me don't speak
Now you know not to send me no beat
Cause I'mma kill it
And murder anybody That'll wanna get it
Where they wanna get up in it cause I be the realest
I'm a menace all the way up to the finish
Make an enemy diminish
When I get up in the battle even if it gotta be on the block
2010 hip-hop, the shit don't stop

[Layzie Bone]
Just slipped through to spit some real thug shit!

[Verse 4: Jaz-O]
What can it be?
Rappers and thuggin on beats
None of 'em keepin it street
Look at them calves, all of them wanna be bulls
None of 'em ready for beef
What about me?
Been through the pain
Sorted the lames, keep it the same
Skillful syllables kill
My rhymin technique is impeccable still
Anybody ever wanna run up
Will get done up in a hurry
Got a flurry
I'mma hunt 'em for the come up
With a bang you better run from the one until you permanently feel it
I will live it, idiots gettin it
"The Originator," gotta keep it greater
Keep the fader for the haters
Nigga real for real
The all-time thriller, ready rockin the death of it definite
On it cookin and cheffin it (ooh!)
Takin over the world
Made of with your girl
Motherfucker recognize the nigga Hugh Heff'in it
Doin what you never did at double time, triple shot president
Ain't nobody better in the residence
Cream of the crop, seein' it stop
Over the top, bringin the soul makin it pop
Got a old school banger make you do the wop
Got a Louisville slugger make you diddy-bop
Ever incredible gotta keep it way ahead of you
Screamin at my niggas in the clink doin federal
No trip, no travesty
I call the lick now I'm up like anti-gravity
Spit words from the brain like charity
If hip-hop was a broad she'd marry me
Gotta keep it gutter, gotta get the bread, gotta get the butter
Make it hot, you can toast word to mother

[Layzie Bone]
Just slipped through to spit some real thug shit![Intro: DJ Kay Slay]
Ay yo, it's DJ Kay Slay, the drama king
So this is what it comes down to, huh?
Y'all niggas think y'all 'bout that life?
Well it's time to show and prove
Fab, set it off!

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Look, I terminate a bitch, like her name was Sarah Connor
Where I'm from, we never meet daddies; swear on mommas
I'm high fashion, so my Gucci reeks of marijuana
My shoes are killing them! I call these a pair of homi-cides
Put me in the passenger and I'mma ride, cause my mind is full of massacres
Killer verses, I lay 'em down and fill up hearses
You can't be the best without knowing who the worst is
Me and Kay a lot alike, we don't fake nothing
Thick bitches in my sheets, I be straight stunting
You got the wrong keys, I ain't who to start with
Rise of the apes, now who you monkeys getting smart with?

[Hook: T-Pain]
I'm bout that money, I'm bout that fetty
I'm down to get it by any means necessary
I'm bout that drama, I'm bout that strife
Now fuck with me or with my team and you gonna see
Bi-bi-bi-bitch I'm bout that life!
I-I-I'm go-going hard, go-going in
Tryna get what I can get before these people give me 25 to life
Now tell them hatin' ass niggas, that hatin' only makes you die quicker
Cause bitch I'm bout that life!

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
In love with the money, infatuated with coupes
Immaculate living, money stack up to my roof
The baddest of women, purse matchin' the boots
That's the half, you don't wanna see what's in that fuckin' bag
Pull it like a flip cam, first you aim it, then you fire
Penthouse smoker, nigga, I can't get no higher
Hella bad heroine in every bag she carry "O."
You niggas ain't getting money, fuck it and carry on
The biggest and the richest, fucking self made
Ricky Rozay and my nigga Kay Slay
Pound of purple green, 2 liter of pink Sprite.
I could flip a brick before a chick can blink twice!

[Hook: T-Pain]

[Verse 3: Nelly]
You know what? You don't like me, I don't give a fuck
Respect is like some money to me, I don't get enough!
Like I ain't put on the hardest city in America
St. Louis, and we ain't scared of ya
King of the drama, see him rollin' with the drama king
Yo Kay Slay, you want lil' momma from your magazine?
You know the one that's got a body like a cartoon
Ass like a whale 'til lil' durrty gotta harpoon
Woo! This stacking racks on racks
Go check my hallways mother fucker, plaques on plaques
These niggas lying a lot, I'm speaking facts on facts
My hotel room's infested durrty, rats on rats

[Hook: T-Pain]

[Verse 4: French Montana]
Looking at a dollar bill, saw the White House
Then I flipped a couple bills, bought a white house
Triple beam on a triple stack, triple back
Going back court like I dribbled back, simple fact
When that drop roller and that top fold up
Bitches going both ways like they're bipolar
Pop the ace Black Jack, ski mask, black mac
Hit the back of your head, turn your fitted to a snapback
Best of the greatest, bought the pussy and paid for maintenance
Waste of money, wack head, the bitch brainless
Word to Kay Slay, you niggas straight stuntin'
I be spending seven digits like it ain't nothin'

[Hook: T-Pain][Intro: DJ Kay Slay]
Yeah, I am in the building with the most powerful movement in Germany
The number one label straight run into the game
Aggro Berlin, you know what the fuck it is, my niggah Fler
The most c- the most c- the most fucking controversy MC out of Germany
You niggahs better act like you all know man, shoutouts to Airmax Muzik
We are going the hard way niggahs, ya

[Hook: Fler]
Das hier ist wieder mal ein Grund diesen Fler zu hassen
Jetzt habt ihr wieder tausend Gründe es wie Fler zu machen
Denn mein Mixtape kommt jetzt raus und es sprengt die Kassen
Und alle Hater und die Medien, nein sie könn's' nicht fassen
Aggro Berlin ist wieder mal da und du siehs' Gangs in Gassen
Jeder drängelt sich nach vorne bis die Wände platzen
Jetzt wird's gefährlich hier im Kiez, denn Fler rappt sein Lied
Das ist Airmax Muzik

[Part: Fler]
Ich bin ein Veteran, jetzt habt ihr wieder was zu meckern man
Doch es wird garnix ändern, glaub mir jede Wette man
Denn ich lauf' Amok, töte Raver auf der Loveparade
Ich bin so strange, von dem Typ kriegt deine Tochter AIDS
Das ist Airmax Muzik, wir geh'n den harten Weg
Von Montag bis Freitag bin ich der, der auf der Straße steht
Ich bin der King du Opfer, lauf in meinen Fußstapfen
Und wenn du's kannst wird es später deine Crew schaffen
Ich hol' euch jetzt zurück auf den Boden der Tatsachen
Ich steh' mit beiden Beinen im Leben wie ein Opa beim Radfahr'n
Ich bin das Alphatier, du trägs' nur 'ne Alpha-Jacke
Junge halt die Klappe, ich schieß' dich ab mit Alpa's Knarre
Du bist am Rock-Am-Ring trägs' T-Shirts von Guns'N'Roses
Ich zeig' dir Punk was Flow is', du lutscht jeden Schwanz im Showbuiss'
Dieses Tape fickt deine Diskographie, ihr macht alle Party
Ich bin in der Disco der G, du bis' kein MC
Machs' Pantomime in dei'm Video, ich bin ein A-G-G-R-O Berlin C-E-O
Reiß' dich zusammen oder ich scheiß' dich zusammen
Ich alleine rapp' jetzt besser als ihr dreißig zusammen, du Opfer
Euer Battle ist ab heute für mich Kinderkram
Du willst Streit mit mir, Homie, stell dich hinten an
Wir sind hart im Nehmen, denn wir geh'n den harten Weg
Airmax Muzik, ich bin der, der auf der Straße steht

Life's a bitch and then you die, this couldn't be worse
I either don't eat this week, or snatch this purse
Clip hangin out the side of my Karl Kani
My eyes bloodshot red, I'm high but LET'S RIDE!
I ain't scared, if I die it was meant to be
He might send for you, before he send for me
Gun-butt you with the back of the baretta
The .357 or, the black MAC-11
We drive bulletproof Coupes nigga, go on take your shot
We used to shoot hoops nigga, now we shoot up blocks
Got them shells with them green tips just for y'all
You can run but they comin through them country walls
Bang dropped me off and show me where he live at
Think he tough? I'mma put six in his six-pack
When you hear that click-clack bitch better get back quick
One to the chest make niggas do backflips

Cold with two to the dome - the little niggas
Don't get to see Disneyland, they'll settle for a funeral home
You don't need hoes to know that the lead's hot
I'm prepared for anything tonight as long as it's not a headshot
The bigger the rim, the bigger the tire
Hollow tips'll make him feel like a nigga on fire
Everybody gotta go, it's the truth
So I figure while I'm waitin on my turn I'mma blow up the booth
I seen niggas in wheelchairs, eye patches and crutches
Arm slings that came home to haze and dutches
We can go there but need I shoot
Put some holes in your Fila suit, you probably hurl when you see my Coupe
I play the hood all the time cause I don't give a fuck
You can shoot me down but as long as I keep gettin up, WHAT!

If she ain't the chick in the mirror she can't out spit me
See dudes see this ass and they think I'm 'gon fornicate
Christmas tree niggas leave 'em hangin like they ornaments
I have 'em order rims, import 'em in
No loiterin, straight origin
Miss flirtatious part mercedes

Uh, he got bling cause he push caucasian

[Verse Two: Remy Ma]
I'm the soul controller
G.I. Joe, ho I control the soldiers
Float like Noah, and I toat for stolers
Leave the nappyhead ho with a comb and a coma
Go console her, yo leave this ho supposed to be
Stylin like me with them posters posted
Know you showed her, I just hold composure
Suck my teeth and sound like an open soda
.....Body like a Coca-Cola
But I quench a nigga thirst like cold Corona
Rode your toaster, I got the coldest shoulder
But I keep my heat warm with my shoulder holder
Coast to coaster, I pays no payolla
And I never do a show, for a broke promoter
Walk in the Queen's kingdom and overthrow her
I'm a first class bitch I ain't got time to coach her

[Hook: Ayanna Irish]

[Verse Three: Hedonis Da Amazon]
The Philly swagger they diggin ya Philly auror
To the O.G.'s I'm Oprah, to the young girls I'm Dorah
I walks, with a glide my talk be 'bout money
Broke niggas always askin why I sound so funny
Huh, communication's key, he never moved a key
He never drove the V, who he talkin to me?
Usin a pick up line by Jay-Z
I'm far from a dummy chick he loadin up his dummy clips
I'm like next, bein broke ain't a protocol
My ears be chandeliers, my chain like a waterfall
My ass like a backyard, heh heh!!!
You never seen a crib steppin out of a car
Let that lightnin bug out of that jar, try to bottle the light
Let it roll like a kite, wind blows catch flies
I'm catchin flights from The U.K. back to U.S.A
My number rings say F-U-C-K

Till the day I die[Intro: Razah]
You can't stop the reign, you can't stop the reign no
When it starts to fall, when it starts to fall

[Shaq]
RIP B.I.G. from your big dog BIG. D.E.E.Z. Shaq Diesel
Kayslay, Kayslay Money Mark, Money Mark Studda Box, Box

[DJ KaySlay]
Yeah it's the champions, Kayslay
Greg Street, come on

[Verse 1: Bun B]
You see the sun goin down and the moon starts to rise
The winds pickin up and it's lightnin in the skies
Everything darkens and the clouds start to form
That's when you see an underground king bring the storm
Settin out the bait like he's goin for the kill
With black leather gloves wrapped around the blue steel
All about the green give a damn how you feel
You got yellow down your back you can't rock with the Trill
Leave you red from head to toe, give you the blues
When I fix you with some light grey cement shoes
I rode trues and vogues, nice blades and pirelli's
On that O Six benx the color of apple jelly
It's a wrap for you pimpin, like a hoagie at the deli
You was the man back in the day but you Fell like Felly
Now it's a new king on the throne with the roar of the crowd
It's Bun B and while I'm holdin it down, you can't stop the reign

[Hook: Razah]
You can't stop the reign, you can't stop the reign no
When it starts to fall, when it starts to fall
There's no one left to blame, I said it's no one left to blame
If you locked that door, if you locked that door

[Verse 2: Papoose]
Do not disturb, the King usin the bathroom
The Queen's bathin' his body the tub with the statue
My physical is pure, covered in no tattoo
Chillin in my throne the man's home is his castle
You only got a one track mind or what have you
I need a passport for my brain my mind travels
You don't know who's a snake till after they attack you
How do you identify 'em not all snakes rattle
Savages on DVD's comin at you
My concepts is too complex I leave 'em baffled
I'm so far passed you why would I have a battle
When I'm already winnin the war in the rotten apple
I never been selfish it's a non stop hassle
Even when I made peanuts I shed cashew
Try to stop the reign where the pump double barrel
Papoose I'm a bang it on you like Shaq do

[Hook: Razah]
You can't stop the reign, you can't stop the reign no
When it starts to fall, when it starts to fall
There's no one left to blame, I said it's no one left to blame
If you locked that door, if you locked that door

[Verse 3: Shaq]
CD's in the cockpit of a hot drop top whip
Livin Miami style worth of flocks and shit
The platinum plaque hanger, track stranger rim rack banger
Dominerical baller homey I'm no stranger
Diesel Dog Mafia dough propper
Flow alone got me spittin these hot flames with Big Poppa
And I still represent the Bricks
Just like dirt, like when they used to flood the bricks with bricks
From now on call me B.I.G
No disrespect to Notorious B.I.G
R.I.P. but damn when your lookin at me
You be like damn Shaq Dog do it B.I.G
I got a Phantom same color as butter
When I ride by niggas be like damn I can't believe it's butter
Believe me dog I ain't never gotta spit
Iced out grill that says Shaq O'Neil's the shit
Can't stop the reign I told you that man
Money Mark is my bullet Cousin Kenny is my gat man
Dog and Box got my back man
Kayslay, Corey Gunz, Main Street, Lil' Shaq man
That's my circle, try to break it I hurt you
Ain't no gettin out that, I doubt that
Classic maker, resurrect hits smash to bits
Can't you see I mastered this?
What's beef? Who gives a fuck I'm not knowin
Stop askin me 'bout Kobe, D. McNabb, Terrell Owens
The world is mine and you can't get with it
I'm a King not a rat, get it
And I don't pick chicks, that used to pay Deez a visit
Until I married somethin esquisite
I just gave y'all thrity bars, my garage got thirty cars
Four, five and sixes

[Hook: Razah]
You can't stop the reign, you can't stop the reign no
When it starts to fall, when it starts to fall
There's no one left to blame, I said it's no one left to blame
If you locked that door, if you locked that door[Intro: Kon Artis]
Yeah, we straight from the census bureau
Haha, Runyan Ave
We lookin for yo' momma
D-12 - where yo' momma at?
Miko - where yo' momma at?
Young Zee, hey Dame - where yo' momma at?
I wanna fuck that bitch, her stankin ass
Hey Em where yo' momma at? (Ohhhh-ohhhhh)
Yo..

[Kon Artis]
You know me, Denaun the same ol' nigga
I spray paint your car up like Rain-O nigga
See me and you are sorta like the same I guess
We both rock mics but yours is into our chest
You can't do nuttin to me, Runyan Ave's unruly
And truly this ain't a movie, you get slapped with the tooly
So pass the slimmy and the Hennessy, I got the energy
To steal every car in this vicinity, you feelin me?
Take it back to when Das EFX was sayin niggity-wiggity-wild
Piggity-pow, nigga be out
You don't really want war, I'm chillin at your door
This uzi will have you bloody windmill-ing on the floor
I can't be a punk, my daddy wasn't none
I lose a fight after school and I came home and got one
You reap what you sew, that shit you oughta know
I keep it on the flo' under the seat - I ain't a ho!

[Hook: Kuniva] + (Kon Artis)
You know it's been a while but we feelin it now
(The rough sound muh'fucker, niggas killin it now)
Goddamn! You don't want no problems B
(Get your name in the obituary column sheet)
It's that same ol' shit, niggas back again
(Yo yo, you fallin off, goin back to smokin crack again)
Hit the weed (guzzle your Corona) pass the Gin
(Better duck cause they back bustin gats again)

[Swifty]
A basket case indeed; stronger than a can of mace
Slap you in the face while you patty-cakin witcha seed
I'll be makin all these niggas wanna take a beam
And put it right on my head
You don't be takin heed, you probably idol the Feds
Havin meetings to recite what I said
Liable to have you in a medical room
Walk in that bitch with a cell phone then turn it on
"You fittin to die holmes!" {*explosion*}
Got a chrome that be fuckin up shit worse than I
You would swear that I'm a Gemini
I kill a guy for nothin - eye to eye
And I ain't gotta touch them niggas face soon as I say somethin
Got a pump that'll tear your arm quick, when I leave a carcass
You would think you in Death Row's office (AHH!) {*gun clicks*}
(Hang a nigga!) I'm ill enough to fall in the middle of moshpits
Survive and I'm gettin up high without a flaw bitch!

[Hook]

[Proof]
I'm a dog on the mic that'll brawl out with Christ
Get to cappin at your captain 'til he fall outta life
I'm all outta nice, nigga tuck your chain
Put holes in your head and finger-fuck your brain
Fool fuck this game, I'm poppin at coach
Momma dropped me on my head and knew that somethin was broke
I ain't feelin nothin you wrote so I'm stompin your throat
Show up at the hospital and start punchin your folks
I'm a uzi with arms and legs
Duty calm your man, before my tooly bomb his head (WHAT!)
You wanna take what my 40-cal since you bitch-made
Spittin the right game so yo' ass can get laid
The fuck down, I don't give a fuck now, whassup?
Talkin bout "Clappin" - quit actin, you barely bust nuts
Don't get it twisted at the gates, the name is Proof
And I'mma kill every man that came with you

[Bizarre]
Yeah, yeah - KNOCK KNOCK! Guess who showed up?
44-mag and tear your whole door up
Pink shower cap and, yellow drawers
My dick's so small, I can pee on my own balls (hahaha)
When it comes to pussy, Bizarre goes to work
That's why my mouth smell like hot dogs and yellow Persh (eww!)
So tell your momma hit me on my cell phone
I ain't home, I'm so wet gettin stoned with Norah Jones

[Hook]

[Kuniva]
Yo, I chuck niggas daily, a six-man crew that's born crazy
A triple O.G. like Tray Deee (whattup Loc?)
I stay sparkin, bitch I got a attitude
I step on your shoes and won't say pardon - be cautious!
Hidin from the one-time, nutty as I wanna be
Wild and disorderly, pissin on your toilet seat
Nigga now you know it's me, I got a .44 wit me
Bitches all over me, +Sayin Yes+ like Floetry
Homie you wanna be a G? Go toe-to-toe wit me
It ain't no ho in me dawg, I shoot out where your colons be
Wave the people-mover, crowd-controller
Rob niggas 'til my pockets look greener than Yoda
And you know that I'm the +Shady+ type, the crazy type
That's probably why promoters never pay me right
We a bunch of hooligans, my hands is on the tool again
I'm bout to bust a Huey and spray up a fuckin school again

[Hook]

[Outro: Bizarre]
Yeah.. D-12
Devil's Night.. part two..
The drama.. continues..
KaySlay.. hahahaha..[Intro]
R.I.P. to Sean Bell
R.I.P. to Kathryn Johnston
R.I.P. to Amadou Diallo
The list goes on
Change gon' come

[Hook]
It's been too hard living but I'm afraid to die
Cause I don't know what's up there beyond the sky
It's been a long, a long time coming
But I know a change gonna come, oh yes it will

(Change gon' come!)

[Verse 1]
No justice, no peace
Another black man shot dead in the streets
Make the whole hood feel sad, it's sadness
But we feel mad, it's madness
Mike Oliver said his gun jammed, he the main one
12 year veteran and don't know how to use a gun, think we dumb?
If ya clips was loaded to the top
And your gun jammed, how ya fire 31 shots?
Say you shot at the man cause you thought he was strapped
But you killed a man cause you thought he was shooting back
Black America, what type of garbage is that?
The police academy arming these fools with gats
If your reason was you thought he carry a gun
That mean you killed him for nothing, cause he ain't have one
I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired son
Hope change get here before the revolution come!

[Hook]
It's been a long, a long time coming
But I know a change gonna come, oh yes it will

(Change gon' come!)

[Verse 2]
Patrick Lynch is an asshole, he siding with the cops
He said they wasn't wrong for firin' all 'em shots
He said if they felt a threat they 'posed to pop
And they should continue shooting until the threat stop
The nerve he got, another word said
They should continue shooting until Sean Bell was dead
Bloomberg spoke, but we expect him to
He said 50 shots was unacceptable
And he said nobody know how to feel and be another race
They don't respect that, they call it haemoth disgrace
Press conference in front of everybody
He responded faster than his predecessor Mayor Giuliani
Some say he spoke it illogically
He got some better manners but let's see if we get some better policy
Don't fall for it, it's all tricknology
Hope the change get here, before they try to body me

[Hook]
It's been a long, a long time coming
But I know a change gonna come, oh yes it will

(Change gon' come!)

[Verse 3]
The law states a cop is not permitted to shoot at a moving car
It don't make a difference if it's coming straight at him, cause if they shoot the driver a 4000 pound car could cause more drama
But when I heard Charles Barron speak, I believe
He said, "If we gotta bleed, then others gotta bleed"
Five cops placed on administrative leave
But they murdered a father, left behind two seeds
Why was the cops in the club, drinkin' a bottle?
Why was the 41 shots shot at Diallo?
John Podhoretz from the New York Post
Wanna know why Bloomberg and Al Sharpton still close
I read his article, he question it
Why was Bloomberg surrounded by African-Americans?
I guess the loss of a life was a Mayg
Called Sharpton a race-hating-cop-hater

[*50 shots*]
*Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang*
*Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang*
*Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang*
*Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang*

(*Laughing*) Brooklyn
This is the set-off
Kay Sleezy
Take it to the streets nigga
Word up
Sauce Money
Uh, uh
Proper set-off

Don't get it fucked up cuz Sauce calm wit his grandma
Cuz I'm like baking soda bitch, I'm armed with a hammer
And when I'm strapped fool, fuck your brother
Cuz like Jimmy Ivene in Virginia you in the scope like a muthafucka
Fine, niggas don't wanna let him shine
Niggas hate that fact Sauce don't give a fuckin' nine
Soon as he ran his mouth, one tre pound seven to nine
Guess who's the odd man out
I guess we got something in common
I'm just a little more calm when
I'm about to split your arm in
Put a hole so big in your noggin
That if you God body, you can fit the whole sun, moon and star in
You starvin' for more lyrics I know
Steady robbin' all them lyrics I flow
I'm Sadam-ing all you niggas fo sho
You betta know I'm a true nigga, please do nigga
Betta inquire from a few niggas
Cuz bitch, I done shit on quite a few and quieted a few niggas
Get a grip, dead four-fifth in the hip
Slip, never picture me fallin' nigga don't trip

[Killer Mike]
Stoned is the way of my walk
In a mini-mack eleven, the tone when I talk
When I spray niggas pray, lay on the sidewalk
Color blood red, body outlined in chalk
My rhymes, two zigs all nines
Hard hit when they spit, split wigs double time
This eightball's a strict nine
Tear apart body parts when I spark nine
At they head hard lodged in they damn spine
Leaves emcee's like Christopher Reeves, crippled and cryin'
Shittin' in a bag and a breath away from dyin'
Nigga I'm - the epitomy of raw rhymes
The epitomy of rap rock
I make a block party bop to the sounds of a hot Glock
From New York down to Georgia it don't stop
Killer Kill from Addamsville with a hot Glock
Blaaat!

[Bun B]
They say murder is the case they wanna throw me
I guess these muthafuckas don't know me
O.G. rock called a yay slanger
PA's finest
Underground muthafuckin' king call me "Your Highness"
I tear your sinus with this gun powder
Wipe your tears with the steal, no fear this is real niggas
Here is the deal: you clear in this field
And ain't stoppin' until every hater here is revealed
Cuz we don't need no fuckin' clearance to peel
Or shortstoppers runnin' and the fear is revealed
So - get off this block homie handle your corner
Keep all your heroin, rocks and you mariju-wana
I'm like a - character on the Sopranos or the Wire
You'se a - big pussy lil' man, it's over, retire
Cuz the - clock's tickin', your days is done
But we know all them lil' different fuckin' ways you slum
But it's trill downtown, your momma's all free
Your house is sugar-layin' with your wife and your seed
Yes indeed, Big Bun is on a home invasion
You gon' bleed on my gun from your dome abrasions
Cuz my chrome is blazin', I'm naughty crunk
Got the bop gun like Sir Nose D'Voiddoffunk
Bitch, I pull a sawed-off from under the waist
Open your eyes muthafucka, you got thunder to face
Fuck rest, we gon' lay these muthafuckas to waste
You bit the pully nigga tell me, how the fuck did it taste
From my gun...
Big guns, big power
M. Woods, sixth hour
Berettas, Tauruses, Rugers
Smith and Wesson's, Glocks and lugers
AK's, AR 15's
Mack elevens and M-16's
High caliber, so why try it?
You live by it, so you die by it
A muthafuckin' gun...

[WC]
Who's the man with the strap in his hand
Homie's stolen semi-autos and contrabands
All day every day, crossin' my hood in day
In a six-trey with my nigga Kay Slay
Dub the law scan, the infrared scanner
Hangin' out the window, hittin' em up with the bandana
And I can't stand a snitch so I - clean the lid
Just in case them bitch niggas wanna sing with this
I stay on the trigger, cuz lames hate me nigga
They can't pay me nigga, where my lay dates nigga
Where AK one-on-one so thirty shot
Nine millimeter Melindas aimed ready to send ya
So put your can on your vest like a Bible and pray slowly
Cuz this'll leave your teflon holey
With the forty Glock ready to ring, bring the trauma to the scene
It's the Ghetto Heisman and the Drama King

[Joe Buddens]
It's about that time nine-milli clappin'
Dude, what's really crackin'?
I been gettin' it since 'Paid In Full' was really happenin'
I gotta do it like that to keep my street name
And pride made me kill Wayne Growe when the heat came
I don't smut but stimulation is good
I keep the hammer with me, Joey's renovatin' the hood
Difference between us, I'm gettin' loot on tours
Good shoes on the Beem, you got a boot on yours
Dudes with no names wanna put an end to me
But doggs, I'm readin' between the lines, the whole game's in parenthesis
Talk about models and how you with somethin'
When you really shootin' air balls, you ain't hittin' nothin'
Nathan, through the strip, O.G.'s blazin'
Street niggas slowly hatin' on Joey so amazin'
And hood niggas knowin' what up
Either holdin' you down or holdin' you up, throwin' it up
Oh!

[Hak Ditty]
Aiiyo, fuck the dumb shit, when the guns spit
One clip'll have your whole strip laid down
Thirty-two shots to your block, I had that shit caged down
And before you blink, I let off eight rounds
This the ro-yal I ain't playin'
I'm takin' this over, so y'all either layin' or dying
And I won't hesitate to blaze the iron
You cocksuckers is chillin' with a ragin' lion
I see them dudes every day, when I'm racin' by 'em
Or on the curb poppin' bottles while they hatin' and eyein'
Uh, whether the slider or the highrider
I keep my block rocker, Glock under the blue dosser
Far as Philly, it's no question to who's liver
I'm hotter, Hak Ditty, block locker
Fully prepared
I hope y'all fully aware that y'all niggas got a problem this year

(*Gunshots*)[Verse 1: Gunplay]
Shit ain’t gravy, shit ain’t wavy
Not even close, to copacetic maybe
Dade County dog, little runt with the rabies
Call D-C-F, we drowning these babies
Cuba, Haiti, Voodoo, ladies
Diamonds, rubies, you be, hating
Feel my talents, now you see how my style is
Brutal, malice, the foulest
Gunplay, real name ratchet Moralis
A nigga trigger-finger catching a callus
I go [*snarl/growl*] to all the cats in the alley
Stepping on these rats in my Baileys
With bats in the Caddy
He already not looking shabby; go for the gold
Retriever, labby, torch, G to K, B-X, ain't it?
Triple C, leave your G-S, painted

[Hook: Gunplay]
Bogota, Medellin, both on the way here
And when they drop, you know they gon' stay here
Machines, machetes, Maybach, mayhem
Excuse me motherfucker, ehem!

[Verse 2: Vado]
Ball all day, never sit on the benches
Bitches want attention and niggas wanna be mentioned
Two-four-five is what a nigga benching
Ain’t a scope, hit his henchman
Grab a rope, get the lynchin'
I’m handin' rappers suspensions
School of hard knocks, I come from a hard block
We’re pumping them hard rocks
I’m in the drop, one button away from a hard top
I’m playing the park lot, away when the narcs watch
Sitting on wild 'ye, foul play, is why I stay on my toes like ballet
No cars, but hand more keys than valet
Get robbed, they hand me the keys the way you down stay
If I play the bar, the Cris pours
Kick saw, deal in the cars with slick talk
Sick boy, I go hard, I spit raw
Far as broads, I threw more lobs than Chris Paul

[Hook: Gunplay]
Bogota, Medellin, both on the way here
And when they drop, you know they gon' stay here
Machines, machetes, Maybach, mayhem
Excuse me motherfucker, ehem!

[Verse 3: Uncle Murda]
Trust who? I don’t know who to trust
I got my hammer out, I don’t know who to bust
My V-V-S diamonds got them hating on me
Stick up kids outside the club, they waiting on me
I hit them up, now they waiting on the paramedics
Them niggas needed to get shot, like a diabetic
Puerto Rican girls, in my hotel room
I let my man fuck 'em, he going to jail soon
He got a threesome before he did his one-to-three
I almost walked in the court room with my gun on me
A nigga stay strapped, almost forgot I had it
A nigga still banging, almost forgot I'm rapping
Shut the club down, poured a hundred bottles
I was murder team, I’m uncle Luciano
You know, big talk, boss shit
When I do it, I do it big, horseshit

[Hook: Gunplay]
Bogota, Medellin, both on the way here
And when they drop, you know they gon' stay here
Machines, machetes, Maybach, mayhem
Excuse me motherfucker, ehem!

[Verse 4: Sauce Money]
All I need is one square to function
And a connect that will meet me at the junction
Niggas talking reckless for nothing
But as long as it’s behind my back
I’m cool with niggas fronting
Cops on the street is like watching T-V
Lay back in the cut and watch 'em, easy
They say real G’s move in silence
So in order to get it, I just had to be me
Any plug comes with P-C
Me first, me second, me three
They say you ain’t a money nigga
Till your whip is a year ahead and your chick is out in D-C
But my Philly thing is imperial
That thing out in Virginia's wife material
My California love is so serial
My Indianapolis thing is so motor vehicle

[Hook: Gunplay]
Bogota, Medellin, both on the way here
And when they drop, you know they gon' stay here
Machines, machetes, Maybach, mayhem
Excuse me motherfucker, ehem!DJ Kay Slay: Holler at your boy, Saigon, set this shit off!

[Hook: Saigon]
Me when I'm rhymin', remarkable timin'
Shorty's with brown eyes that sparkle like diamonds
Us in the park when we played on the swings

From where we at to my man's cell
I move rhymes like retail, make sure shit sell
From where we at to my man's cell

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
Straight outta cell 12 a hell fell on my lap
A nigga was born to rap 'bout drug tales and all the rats
This is for Chef Jr., now that's Italiana
Chicken Parmesan and bocce with my paesanas
I told my [?] I'll die with my honor paesana
Six bad bitches, some marijuana, with [?]
If you could see the pictures and the scriptures that these bitches sent me
Hopped in the Ghost, my wiz jumped in the sister Bentley
When Suge had the Row, Jay start the Roc
I was in the [?] fuck the cops
With the killer cross, had Iverson on the block
Graced the cover of The Source, tell me that ain't hot
Went in for RICO, kilos, wish they gave me the max
Fuck them C.O.'s, and C. Ho's for hatin' on crack
Four months on the toilet shit, I can do that
Came with thirty, left with three, now how the fuck he do that?
Most these niggas in the Fed shoulda been in the State
[?] the Texas to Brazil, now we raisin' the stakes
I seen Gordouli, know that nigga big like Chapo
Shout out to you know who, let me fuck in the chapel
[?], first thing in the mornin'
Tried to send me to the shoe for the first pair of Jordans
I had a thing for the secretary, wassup Ms. Jordan?
All that ass in them pants had you feelin' important
Left with J's on my feet, J's, J's on my feet
Straight out the cage, sun raised on the beach
And I ain't got to lie, my son raised on the beach
Crib with the elevator, Gabe on the piece

[Hook: Raekwon]

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Gun tote, move dope, niggas know my repertoire
Bulletproof smart car, level six AR
Cocktail, Molotov, burn heat, turn heat
Revolve, cock, bang, revolve, it's off
Cocaine, medating, codeine better lean
The fuck out my way, drive the bricks down the highway
Its an anthem when I rant, fuck you think I am, Kanye?
I had them wearing vests, now these niggas wear dresses
I take you back to the essence, free of charge a nigga so large, these niggas is stressin', I bless 'em
The pounds the purple with profits precise
With precision, we'll move you up the pillar, you get that right
Money motivation, this bread in the basket
Go ahead, say something 'bout it while you gettin' your ass kicked
Niggas back on the New York bullshit
My little man post up in the bank with a full clip, he let it off

[Hook: Raekwon]

[Outro: Barbra Streisand]
Free again
Back to bein' free again
Back to bein' me again
With all my precious freedom
My precious, precious freedom[Eminem - talking]
I'd be a horrible mixtape DJ
I would be really fuckin bad
THIS IS MOTHERFUCKIN EMINEM!
Or just Eminem
Whatever you want to call me
And your listenin to the motherfuckin easy listenin sounds, or whatever
Clear your fuckin ear wax out
This is motherfuckin DJ Kay Slay
The Drama King and it goes a little somethin like this
Yo turn that click off, alright

(*beat to Eminem, Obie Trice & 50 Cent's "Love Me" starts*)
Look...

[Eminem]
My music is soothin', but it's also been proven
That it can put you in the mood to jump out of ya car while it's movin'
You've been waitin' on this moment, my sermon
Is like a omen; I'm servin', I'm Erick Sermon
I saw the window was open and I jumped through it
My shit, if you don't get pumped to it
I quit; here's my rhyme book, go 'head and thumb through it
And pick what you want from it, rummage 'til ya find somethin'
You can use to jump someone and roll up bumpin'
I'm constantly coppin' over you, squattin'; shit has gotten
To the point where I'm ain't even writin' no more, I'm just jottin'
This is chicken scratch; shit is sickenin', I've been kickin' ass
Off bullshit throwaway rhymes, pick a batch
I live for the love of rap, you crazy?
I've made beats for Jay-Z for free, page me
You need a beat... you Canibus? Then it's Dre's fee
You Kay Slay? The fee's waived; I stay beefin'
With JD to the day Dre two-ways me
That it's okay to stop blazin' him
Oops, I put it out
I apologize now, it's too late, G
It's on tape, and the tape leaked
"Say what you say," motherfucker!
Drama King, Kay Slay motherfucker!
We dictate these mixtapes motherfucker!
Xzibit, blaze this little gay midget cocksucker[Micheal Jackson]
See the kids in the street with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind?
Pretending not to see their needs...

[Verse 1: Papoose]
This remind me of the block party, back in the day we used to jam the most
Used to plug the music into the lampost
I reminisce too much but if a man don't
He might forget where he came from and can't approach
The place he tryna go, a wise man won't
I ain't at the top yet but I'm so damn close
My bros honest, so modest, I can't boast
Fast food I can't coat, I took home cooking for granted
Cause I couldn't imagine, These girls can't cook
They so into fashion, I like 'em cause I'm so into passion
But man when I was growin' up my mama was multi-tasking
She was frying chicken while holding the phone
Between her face and shoulder and smokin' a bone
Combing my sister's hair, she think she's grown
But her hair was so nappy, it broke the comb!

[Hook: Micheal Jackson]
Gonna make a change...
For once in my life...
It's gonna feel real good...
Gonna make a difference...
Gonna make it right...

[Verse 2: Papoose]
R.I.P. to Luther Vandross
A house ain't a home without yo fam close
I get phone calls saying: "Pap come save me
I hear you on the radio you're buzzing like crazy
I'm out here in the jungle with me gun of safety
Repping for your name, these niggas can't take me."
Reply: "I'm still tryna save myself
The industry is all fam, don't mistake it for wealth."
Couple days later, I heard somebody laid him
Thinking to myself: "Maybe I coulda saved him?"
Some say they never change, but let money change them
They change for the worst so they start fating
Some niggas go to jail and come home praising
The most high telling you he's so amazing
Some people spend their whole life committing the same sin
I guess it'll only take death to change them

[Hook: Micheal Jackson]
Gonna make a change...
For once in my life...
It's gonna feel real good...
Gonna make a difference...
Gonna make it right...[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
Flipmode bitch! Streetsweepers bitch! Kayslay! Greg Street! Busta Rhymes!

Kayslay and Greg Street a go off, a go off

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Official on the way down from the streets to the judicial system
See the nickel plated chrome Ferrari angel make them bitches whistle
The pistol that I carry is licensed
Despite I'm a felon I ingrade my initials on the handle with a hyphen
When I pop I make 'em wild like the hyphy movement
Type environment inappropriate shouldn't bring your wifey to it
King of holdin the title always growin you know it's me
You know it's 'sposed to be how it's official bitch diplomacy
You it's such shit it's so glorious
And while your caught in the matrix just call me Morpheus AKA Lord Victorious
The streets applaudin us Feds is recordin our conversation
While celebratin this new release enjoy this good occasion
My proclamation make sure your thoroughly aware

What you forgot, thought I remind y'all

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]

[Verse: Gunplay]
Empire shell catcher, on this

Hundred-fifty in the can, dusting
Still burning bam, run it down
You short by the gram, you can die about that
Ain’t no lying about that, my dawg
So we going bank beaucoup. I roll 88 acres — zoo crew
Handcuffs like a noose, too
Bitch, I’m black ops — noob tube
Now who wanna run on one then?
Run one gun in?
Left him in one Tim
Fuck you want me to do?
Feeling unbeatable
My wolf pack snapping, looking unfeedable
Get buddy buddy, gonna get bruised, untreatable
I'm on that shit Steven Seagal do
You know what
Got trialed all the way
The judge who tried it, man, he died on the way
All that there meat, it's mine all the way
Gas station — don't drop a dime on the way

[Hook]

[Verse: Ace Hood]
Blood, sweat, and tears — Mind over matter
Shitting on you niggas, got a bad bladder
Britain panorama (zoom), my bitch from Atlanta
Sit on daddy lap, yeah, she call me Santa
Dancing in that pussy. Bitch, I think I’m MC Hammer
Touch my paper, bitch, I’m bucking like I’m out of Tampa
Still at it, they say my flow tragic
Fuck them niggas, clean the scene like it was Proactiv
Real niggas, deal with them. Leave a nigga in a box like Tommy Hilfiger
What up, Kay? Give me some of them bad bitches
The ones who like it rough and hard, like them college quizzes
You feel me? You feel me?
Have them bitches coming back, just like a Frisbee
Word up, straight stunting
Bitch, I hit the villa, talking five-hundred

[Hook]

[Verse: Torch]
AK, AR, hollow-tip accessible, run up in your vestibule
Dodge you like a decibel, leave your ass a vegetable
Beefing, now you a side dish
I ain’t a chef but I mastered how to fry fish
When digits stacking, kidding turn into kidnapping
I know the pigs tapping, so we convo Pig Latin
Feds following me like I’m playing Simon Says
Bishop... niggas 'til the Drama dead
I’m with the drama king, you know how drama do it
Like sheets on the spot, next stop trauma unit
Head buster, leader of the military
Bread like Pillsbury, I ain't never been scary
Street sweepers, three divas, straight stunting
When money ain't nothing, of course they fucking
No strings, I control you ― puppetmaster
(?)

[Hook][Intro: DJ KaySlay]
Yeah it's DJ KaySlay the Drama King
I'm in the house with my nigga Sauce Money
Memphis Bleek, holdin it down from the East coast
And from the West, I got my nigga Game
All you bitch-ass niggas, y'all better fall the fuck back
Y'all know how this shit is about to go down
Yo homie, what's your name?

[Sauce Money]
My name is Money, that much is true
Listen up, this what I'm gon' do
I won't wait for you to get a lil' bigger
I hit you with the tec-9, lil' nigga
Look at him - red as a muh'fucker
Hah! Dead as a muh'fucker
Unassisted - aiyyo you shoulda
Been there Bleek, too late, you missed it
Cock back my biscuit
Like a fat chick and chocolate, I can't resist it
Didn't believe you, so for your big ol' ego
I got a big ol' Eagle
Gotta give the people
Not a fuckin chance to see you inside the sequel
Son I stay stuck in rude
So when they see me comin they like, "Damn, here come this fuckin dude!"

You know'm sayin Memph'?

[Hook: Memphis Bleek]
Sawed-off shotgun, hand on the pump
Sippin that Arme', puffin on a blunt

La la la la la-la la lahhhh

[Memphis Bleek]
What, yo yo
You know Bleek always smokin that "La La La" - you right
Groupies they be actin too crazy, tell 'em they too hype
They want leave with a G like Eas'
Educated the bullshit, got a degree in these streets
But - I dare a nigga act all crazy
The tec'll tear his back all crazy
And you know I stay bent off the Arme'
Regardless if solo or I'm deep with my amry
I rep - straight from the jacked M-P
If I put the tec up I gotta tote the D.E
But wait! You know I'm ridin with Sauce
And we ridin this song from out the Robb Report
Dawg, I'm from the street, from the best I'm taught
I'll get your man tied and lost, fuck the cost
Got a couple of my killers who stand by
And I'm G-Force stat' nigga, never fly stand-by

Uhh, jeah, you know

Brooklyn shit, Sauce
Let's bring the hook back, here we go yo

[Hook]

[The Game]
Dip through N-Y, black Impala, matchin interior
Cali plates, I'm that serious
Niggas think the kid a joke

Homie I bring the drama (drama)
Sleep on The Game and get left in wooden pajamas
Nigga I ain't easy son
But I break up rock/Roc like DipSet and M-Easy son
I'm a B-L-double-O-D
Hardest nigga since S-N-double-O-P
And all this beef got blood in my eye
Aftermath motherfucker, you could love it or die
Keep Dre name out your mouth boy
Or get your +Bones Crushed+ like them Dirty South boys
I'm a "Menace," fuck Kane and O-Dog
Since I was ten I had 'caine and O's, dawg
I ain't lyin (I ain't lyin)
They gave Eazy AIDS, so why should I give a FUCK about dyin?
And the day Jay retire
I'mma park next to the throne, in a Maybach on gold wires, yeah

[Hook]

[Outro: DJ KaySlay]
Yeah you bitch-ass motherfuckers
