[Intro: Open Mike Eagle]
We have a fuckin', uh, incredible show for you tonight
Pardon me for saying "Fuckin'" on network television—
I'm not gonna have this job for long—It's Exile!
It's me, it's you. These are our guests
Let's go. Yeah

[Open Mike Eagle]
I gave up and became a Spotify-er
Paying myself a fraction of a penny playing "Qualifiers"
I'm looking up and I'm stuck in a Chucky movie
Saying yucky shit for chuckles like it's Lucky Louie
So somebody better cancel me
Before I get a chance to screen this ass-naked dance routine
It's dark comedy, cold as a soldier's stare
I've been exposed, so now the LOLs is my over-wear
And I'm a polar bear with words for a fancy song
I think it's the first verse from Little Miss Can't Be Wrong
Fuck you, I like the Spin Doctors
Is that dude Finn's father or just an impostor?
The new internet thing's to be pretend awkward
Non-prescription, thick-rimmed frames and rented gym lockers
I'm a rapper, we lament being broke
All the comics get money, but they spend it on coke
You can watch us on the newsfeeds
Fucking y'all's mornings up
Until America admits that it likes dogs more than us
And I can see the Super Bowls of the future:
The Ferguson blacks vs. Missouri State Troopers
The privacy rights vs. the personal computers
Concussion researchers vs. university boosters
I graduated college, I purchased all the extra books
I'm supposed to be living in a house with a breakfast nook
Joke's on me, though
All this cheap alcohol and no Coke Zero
Ashamed how proximity kills yo heroes
Hey, yo, no poking, I'm still woke, Cee-Lo
Yeah, It's all ripped from the headlines
I'm all outta options like a Crip on the red line
I got a deadline, before I never had a deal
Stormed out of business meetings, slipped on mass banana peels
I should probably shut my stupid mouth
Shirtless in a fur hat and Vladimir Putin pout
And North Korea's got practice missiles
And I still check Yahoo cause we both got attachment issues
Our Congress moves just like a cult could
Invade Iraq 15 times in my adulthood
And we quit asking for the reasons
And clicked the Constitution's terms of service agreements
We're dreaming from sundown to high noon
And woke up by U2 albums all in your iTunes
And it's close to a all out war
With kids being murdered just for being black and tall outdoors
They respond to demonstrations wearing kevlar briefs
When the main problem is nobody respects our grief
They say if it bends it's funny, if it breaks it ain't though
I still got broke pockets and trying to host the Late Show
Recording it every night, but I don't know where the tape go
Homeless fashionistas tell me everything that they know
Yeah, you got a style
Tie them fancy sandals up, smile
You on the NSA's candid cameras, now
I'm in a church basement learning Shotokan
I saw Jesus taking a selfie and I photobombed
And dude better tag me
A little recognition makes me do better gladly
Like this one time when I got booed at a track meet
In a Hellfyre Club sweater for two letter athletes
One for regret dreams, one for most suppressed team
Pressure valve gets released and sprays like a jet stream
Karl Kani’s and Z Cavaricci’s from Chess King
K-Mart name brands were the least interesting
I appreciated presidential speeches on the West Wing
I never had wet dreams or piloted an X-Wing
I'm still terrible at being sarcastic black
My man Exile, he knows what I'm laughing at
My man Toy-Light, he knows what I'm laughing at
The studio audience knows what I'm laughing at

[Outro: Open Mike Eagle]
Laughing at all types of shit
I laugh at, um, CNN. I don't know why
That might be an issue; that might be a problem actually
It's not, it's not a humorous channel, you know what I mean?
It's not trying to compete with Comedy Central
If anything, it's trying to compete with Headline News
Which I'm pretty sure is like the same company
Or it's trying to compete with, uh, MSNBC kinda
MSNBC is blue and to the left
CNN is red, white, and black, and in the middle
And Fox News is bright red and hollerin', and on the right
And there's an elephant and a donkey
And then an eledonkeyphant. A donkaphant
Uh, a helladonkaphant. Shit[Intro]
Rappers belong to things
They got affiliations and shit and I do too
But fuck gangbanging, yeah

[Verse 1: Open Mike Eagle]
Life's kind of sucky bro
If you hearing this consider yourself lucky, though
Sharks in the boardroom program for guppies
Baby cuddle bunny in the box full of puppies, sho
No perm, grow a 'fro like Pam Grier
Don't say 'bro' bruh say manssiere, yeah
Any karaoke fans here?
If so, never get drunk and do Kashmir
It's not a good choice and white rappers quit
Rapping in your hood voice, sound like a clown
Hundred pounder that took 'roids
Don't do videos for tracks with your back to the cameraman
Phones get the family packing big data plan
'99 Problems' was a damn good summer song
If you got more than like three then something's wrong

[Chorus: Open Mike Eagle]
You're drowning in quicksand
You're flailing in the water
You're hands are waving all frantic
You'll die within the hour
Unless you do what we tell you to do
Me and my whole fam we Doug Stamper
(Yeah, yeah, and here's the -)
So you should do what we tell you to do
(Mmmhhh-ahhh - timing, shit!)
I say, good God damn we Doug Stamper

[Verse 2: Open Mike Eagle]
Yeah, and here's the bush I would never beat around
Never march through Korea Town in a Madea gown
Yeah, you know, like a Muumuu
And never buy used from that dude Joe Isuzu
If you find yourself down in Southern Illinois
Cop a mixtape from DJ Snowy Boo-boo, (that's a real dude?) yeah
And don't start them arguments
Or show flowcharts to an art-numb Parliament
And stand guard by your dart gun armament
And memorize your parts like a sharp-tongued artisan
Always tell a lie to C.I.A. torturers
Never buy weed from a guy named Mortimer
Buy bank forfeitures and foreclosures
If you start to lose your hair skip the comb-over
When you home open a game with the Orioles
A journalist should never write a slang editorial

[Chorus]
You're drowning in quicksand
You're flailing in the water
You're hands are waving all frantic
You'll die within the hour
Unless you do what we tell you to do
Me and my whole fam we Doug Stamper
So you should do what we tell you to do
I say, good God damn we Doug Stamper

[Verse 3: Hannibal Buress]
You a grown man do what I told you to
Stop pissing on the motherfucking toilet stool (disgusting)
Wash your hands when you touch your little dirty dick
And dry 'em off before you come trying to shake my shit (get outta here)
You a ho if your Facebook is complicated
Eat your fruit fiber bitch or get constipated (grrr)
No finger waves, except baby face
LeBron James needs to stop taking HGH
His hairline fucked up from the HGH
Went from one headband to like, eighty-eight
You ain't a thug, stop acting like you've been through shit
Stop paying for them porn site memberships  (that shit's a waste)
Go to YouPorn nigga, that shit is free
But don't bootleg my comedy, pay the fee (buy it)
Tell your cousin, stay the fuck from off of Worldstar
And don't buy a Honda Civic, that's a girl's car
And don't buy a Chevy Aveo, or a Mini Cooper or Yaris
And don't, don't set stuff on fire either

Actually, if... If you can only afford one of those cars, cause those are compact cars and are very affordable, then get that, don't let me judge your life, but that other stuff, I mean that other stuff

Yeah[Verse 1]
I see the deepest greens
I hear the darkest blues
Might not be synesthesia
Might be apartment fumes
G-g-get up and dance
G-g-get up and dance
I w-w-wipe my son's ass
And get shit on my hands
He'd get in my car and be like
"Daddy play some Busdriver"
Why the fuck's it take two lines to do a one liner
And why's it take three beats to do a two-step
Sick days, I got two left
So I take five, Dave Brubeck
I make jazz jokes so I'm flat broke
Mad at LOST and that black smoke
Fuck you if you're a white man that assumes I speak for black folks
Fuck you if you're a white man who thinks I can't speak for black folk
Let that soak in your rap quotes
And your head hurt, and your back broke
I'm half black soap and half crack smoke
I admit that it's an imperfect blend
Hold up it's my turn again
I'm playing thirteen games of Words With Friends
Lift your hands
Lift your head if your clothes are clean and your kids are fed
Mine's potty trained, so when he pisses the bed
Then he can tell I'm heated like infrared, yeah

[Hook x2]
We're the best, mostly
Sometimes the freshest rhymers
We the tightest kinda
Respect my qualifiers
Respect my qualifiers
Respect my qualifiers
Respect my qualifiers

[Verse 2]
They say they're looking for me, but I don't wanna hear it
You can find me in the park district, volunteering
With my hair disheveled, and my sneakers scuffed
Or use your gps and get your celly features up
I went to Africa, they played me on the radio
And did I weird the people out, yeah, maybe so
Cause all they knew was jive
And all I do is vibe
And 'Bright Green Light' made the program director lose his mind
He said "What type of rap is that? Ain't no bitches, hoes"
And I ain't even being funny, homie didn't know
Shoulda said it's whimsical
Like Serengeti taught me
My thoughts are very lofty
Response time is very faulty
I'm far too young to lead
And way to old to die
I ain't played Call of Dookie, smoke you in Golden Eye
RPG, roll the die
JPG Kobe Tai
PG 13 Cobra Kai
PPG Luc Robitaille

[Hook]

[Outro]
I didn't write the words you hear me singing
I didn't sing a line before this one
And you are not the one I was addressing
That person took a train to Africa
And simultaneous events don't happen
We are isolated temporally
And the part is never called the whole thing
Though it bothers us to know it so[Verse 1]
Landed some place I ain't never been, yet again
Space travel veteran, never blend
Like they asked you to come around, never end
The initiation most times. If I'm in this
Old school letterman, never been
I'd like to ask if you know the code, Guessing games
Is a game barely controlled that they don't give
Like they gon' live forever
Politicians on straw-man missions
Stumble into town looking all ambitious
It's the ballad of Peter Pumpkinhead
He won't eat the Wonder Bread
He won't pledge allegiances
My saints is dead comedians
Trying to taste this cred is meaningless
That shit is warping my soul

[Pre-Chorus]
Knee-deep in the center
Only water divides us
Same places, different continents
And my head-space is an island
I swim freely through my phylum
I'm tuned to radio silence
Came to me while I was driving
Right then, it was decided

[Chorus]
I ain't never been to this planet
Make eye contact and I'm smiling
[x4]
Eye to eye...

[Verse 2]
Woke up thinking I'm Batman
Every town is like Gotham
I log into my twitter page
And start bending over like Gollum
This dumb cred is like crack rock
And I never seem to hit bottom
My representative smiling at you like
"What the fuck is the problem?"
Walk uncharted lands with no squad
Spots my ancestors picked cotton
They want me to carry their customs
When I know the truth is postmodern
I won't walk like an Egyptian
Don't talk like I be pimpin'
There's in-groups and there's out-groups
And I believe in making distinctions
I'm just smiling and offer you greetings
Hopefully with no pretense
My aim's to honor your physical
And leave room for all of your secrets
We should all play a big Scrabble game
And make every word a confession:
"A-N-X-I-O-U-S."

[Pre-Chorus + Chorus][Verse 1]

Dark comedy cold as the ocean
Add a lol cause nobody seems to know when I'm joking
For those who haven't heard of me
I'm bad at sarcasm so I work in absurdity
On that laugh to keep from crying tip
Rap like Wyatt vs Chet in Weird Science
Cause my genre's all hack
Actions cliche, melodrama falls flat
And everybody's getting fired
I flew off the handle, and boy are my arms tired
Rap songs like Patch Adams
Shadyac thought of it as art 'til they laughed at it
Rap songs like Steven Wright
Monotone drone, people wonder if he breathing right

[Hook]

We got that dark dark comedy
That dark d-dark dark dark d-dark comedy

[Verse 2]

Cause rappers ruin the punchline
Like stand up club hecklers doing the punchline
Cause I'll tweet on Sunday morning like a preacher at a church
Because my true religion is the thirst
It's like Burn After Reading
The dark ugly truth that addicts learn at the meetings
Sean already wrote about the modern man
The only other option is the plight of the hologram
It's dark comedy, I would've called it black
If another dude calls me a racist, I'mma snap
Cause Google knows what's in my cabinet
And Facebook logs all of my favorite sandwiches
And what they need the damn data for
To analyze the shit they'd need a whole 'nother labor force
Cause I'm addicted to my celly
And I gotta have some coffee in my belly, ya smell me

[Verse 3]
There's mad shootings on the news
Unless it's in the Chi, cause blacks and mexicans can die
I swear we live in John Lennon songs
Matching track suit like dude in Royal Tenenbaums
It's like the In Living Color cast
We laugh and try not to wish death on the upper class
I'd like to run up on the Koch Brothers
And beat 'em with a garden hose made of old rubber
Give 'em rock bottoms and a cold stone stunner
Drop some cold butter on 'em from the skyscraper
Pistol whip 'em with the handle of a lightsaber
Cut 'em with rice paper, chuckle like a wiseacre
Instead think of something sarcastic, black
My man Nocan knows what I'm laughing at
My man Busdriver knows what I'm laughing at
My man Milo knows what I'm laughing at[Intro: Khroam]
What the fuck....
This shit really got supported...
Alright, cool, fuck it
Lets go!

[Verse 1: Khroam]
It’s the chronological chronic logical liar
Rapping circles round the novices like golf carts and dryer cylinders
Shit concrete like porn with closed captions
Watch what happens then cum into a penguins habit

[Verse 2: Halfadelic]
Imma fuck yo bitch
Then imma make her shit
If she keep talking Honey Crisps
Then imma make her flip (SWAG)

[Verse 3: Open Mike Aguila]
Swag swag swag swag
Swag swag swag swag
Swag swag swag swag
EXTRA swag swag swag
FUCK YOU!

[Verse 4: The Waters]
COME THRU WITH THE BLUE BADANA
IN MY ASS THERES A BUNDLE OF BANANAS
THINK FAST, BECUZ THEY CALL ME SANTA
FLYING ON REINDEER, CALL IT UR BITCH
WHATS THE SITCH, KIM POSSIBLE
SPITTING IT LIKE LEELO AND STICH
AOHLA MEANS FAMILY

[Verse 5: Gold]
I got 50k in the knapsack
Watch me stunt hard and slay tracks
Got the 9 on me like a price tag
Shootin these niggas with the dice mag
Hoes suck my dick cause I’m such a stunna
Girls blow you off cus you smell like Dung-A

[Verse 6: Murkman]
Fuck bars, that twix is for your kids
Toddlers in a candy store, silly rabbits who fall for Easter Eggs
Meanwhile, I lay tracks to rest with lead pipes
Hip-Hop is Guantanamo, I’m the warden, my bodyguards are dykes

[Verse 7: Genio]
Shut up bitch its bed time
Come for that ass, no homo
Its giggty time
Spit hot fire, Quagmire

[Verse 8: Uncledb]
She sells sea shells on the sea shore, no
He sells weed scales and a P4, yeah
He sells details, swiping the law
Deets, AKA credit card fraud

[Verse 9: Khroam]
Shoot a nigga
Fuck a bitch, nigga
I'm a real nigga
Cuz that's whatcha do when you a real nigga

[Verse 10: Gold]
Airs a little thinner where I breathe
You can find me out in Paris finding pairings for the brie
That’s the king of cheese, shit, I’m getting cheese
Easily imported but I’d rather switch the scene
Hop a flight and I’ll be out in paris by the night, dine at Brasserie

[Verse 11: Nebuchadnzr]
All I need is 4 bars
But I have the skill 2 do it in 3
Cause ain’t no 1 here fucking wit me

[Verse 12: iForgotAboutDre]
Yo I’m so high, bald eagle
Bitch I’m hard to kill, Steve Seagal
Young money Cash money
All I know is money
* Bird call *

[Verse 14: Uncledb]
Don’t bring war to the king
Don’t tell me about draw for The ting
YO Right about now
Your heads so big you get charged more for you’re trim

[Verse 15: Murkman]
I bucked-shots at bill beaks-on, whom can’t stop squawking
Since Murkman can't be conned, yet was marked with a flu, Avian
By condors, ‘cause white-lied pieces of shit, are what you believe in
So best have credence, in that pearl pile, of vanilla pudding
That my wings span, spreading as that strain which sickens at ease
Through the airwaves, like a new form of communicable disease

[Verse 16: BDP29]
Put me on a track with Gambino, I’ll upstage him
His lyrics are so corny, but he thinks they’re amazing

[Verse 17: BiterBitingRewrittenBits]
New jack mess with whatever snappin
Jetting these shark biters kid from gotham will leave you paykin @payked
@SDVG hoes think they supreme, clientele just got them ready to dye
And wannabe wu tang fans think they got cream, super sayian with knowledge show em whats fly

[Verse 18: Khroam]
I got bars and they heavy
Heavy than your mom on a Sunday
I go to church in my Jack Skeletons
I shoot niggas avoid if you not wanting to be a skeleton
I’m heaven sent with bill and shit
I’m Bill Nye I fuck bongs on PBS
Shit correlate nigga more or less
Jumping jacks on the bridge ideal death

[Verses 19 & 20: Murkman]
So you can vote “Yes I Can!” (I'm not lightskinned!), for me in 2016
I’m a real American, just don’t expect me to rep
That red, white and blue, anytime soon because
The fireworks I fire will crack, and split crackers
Down to the middle, like Malcolm or Muniz, to be frank-eeeehh
And go krack-krack..... krack-krack-krack-ka-BOOM, that fire works Though all I do is launch Fireworks, don't call me Canadian, boy
Or I’ll make them waters-work, I’m not sweet, like a maple leaf

But me? I drizzle smoke around, great Redwood trees
As a lumberjack, however I kick into the lumbar region-stumps
Of Black Hippies, to insert vile into ci-vil liberties
‘Cause I’m bringing Independence back, like on the 4th of July
Not rhetoric that you lie about, as if they're views from thee.... 666
I meant 1776, this is a wake up call - TempurPedic, not a Drake diss
Fuck all these sweet 16 ho-bitch niggas, I been spitting sweet 16's
Like Em was an M-16, unloading on ages of whomever was 16

[Verse 21: BDP29]
Call it a Childish insult, but I’ll still call you a faggot
You think your raps are fly, but they’re lower than maggots
Smackin' backs with the mac, is how I enter your palace
Knock you off of Stone Mountain,  drink your blood from a chalice
Call me callous I don’t care, cause your rhymes are wack
Smell the malice in the air, make your skull go crack
Daedalus when I build your cage, pitch black
The fact is when I attack, body bag is packed

[Verse 22: MFarrer74]
You thought I was down and out
But really your mind is in doubt
I've been hiding on the forums for a couple years now
Now it's time for y'all lames to bow
To the greatest to ever touch the keys
QWERTY loves how I do it with ease
Y'all ain’t showing love to my bars
Go ahead and smoke those cigars
While I work on my craft, I remember those stars
On a night that makes me feel like a czar
I don’t know how you can recover from those scars
That I gave y'all while listening to Kendrick Lamar
While holding a 40 as I ride in my car
With a shotty and I think I’ve gone too far

[Verse 23: JonnyMillerRaps]
People who write rhymes
We ain't equal at all times
I dont feel like rappin now
Gimme a bannana peal and half a pound. uh

[Verse 24: NLbway]
I’m young as hell like Caillou
Don’t fail like Caillou
I go for it like Caillou
Fuck Dora, Caillou

[Verse 25: MakNikova]
Before it all surface, no one is perfect
But all of us together can seem worth it
Experimental purpose, scientific verses
I beat box the beat by puttin them in hearses

[Verse 26: Khroam]
Mraz screeching blood clot
Comeback bats locked arena come out
50 cubic part cuban backwood glue in
Gorilla clawing off the lawn
Articulate like God, Aesop stories
Lorie with the loosie and the bleached inflection
Infection Z survival X detonation
Detonations on tracks like logical break in

[Verse 28: Murkman]
‘Cause I pop shots, into the clavicles to crackle M&MC’s
When I snap on, these cracker, sugarcoated motherfuckers
To remind y'all, I’m the original serial killer
To your Hip-Hop-sin, corny ass, trash bag transgressors
Reducing everyone of you down to size, “Honey, I Shrunk The Kids"
Again, god damn and I melted y'all mortals into
Sugary morsels, fried your lyrics and made them a reduction
Just to give RG a taste, of what means to have substance

[Interlude: BTP47]
Aight, guys…I was not prepared to freestyle…

[Verse 29: BTP47]
Its the T U T, yall r just ants to me ima aardvark
Im higher than u think i am on the bar charts
Even higher than a far star
U can even call me fuckin Jupiter
(God that was bad…)
Walked the same roads i know how hard it can be
I’ll guide you, you still fuck with me, don’t take a side or be free
As i’m have poems that has approached by cross roads
Body doze, who ? give em karate blows

[Verse 30: Murkman]
All I hear nowadays, is everyone up to no good, just evil
The D'evil’s in your crew, are less cru-el than, Cru-ella D'e-ville
Emcees trying to act like scam artists, scamming those in the arts
Cocky ass upstarts, whose voice ain’t worth more than my farts
While my craft-Hov-ers-o'er, your Craft Mac-N-Cheesy asses
Triple entendre, so please don’t ask me how, ask Hov
You damn amateurs, who have no respect nor love
For the form, can’t read anywhere, regarding the lines
Unless it’s burning trees, purple streams, or a hero-in white soda
We both already know, about that ego and how you’re “No homo"
Except all you can rap about is a mic, held close in your hand-les
While it’s wrapped close to your lips, so full of your self
Cause, within it has that lightbulb: you’re a flashing ass-hole
Ever wonder that’s why, all you spit is fecal-matter (no subject)?
Bending backwards to reverse cowgirl, a dickrided rapper’s style
Which is an homoerotic urge, you unconsciously, just can’t help
Man, it’s straight away to hell, with you fuck niggas, bruh

[Verse 31: The_Midget]
I’m midget but my dick long
That is what I told your mom, dawg
Playing cricket with my own dong
Hit a homerun don’t give a fuck if it’s the wrong sport

Verse 32: sho
Tell Flex to drop a bomb on this shit
So many bombs, ring the alarm like Vietnam on this shit
So many bombs, make Farrakhan think that Saddam in this bitch
One at a time, I line them up
And bomb on they mom while she watching the kids
I'm in a destruction mode if the gold exists
I'm important like the Pope, I'm a Muslim on pork
I'm Makaveli's offspring, I'm the King of New York
King of the Coast, one hand, I juggle them both
The juggernaut's all in your jugular, you take me for jokes
Live in the basement, church pews and funeral faces
Cartier bracelets for my women friends, I'm in Vegas
Who the fuck y'all thought it's supposed to be?
If Phil Jackson came back, still no coaching me
I'm uncoachable, I'm unsociable, fuck y'all clubs
Fuck y'all pictures, your Instagram can gobble these nuts
Gobble dick up 'til you hiccup, my big homie Kurupt
This the same flow that put the rap game on a crutch (West x6)
I've seen niggas transform like villain Decepticons
Mollies'll prolly turn these niggas to fucking Lindsay Lohan
A bunch of rich ass white girls looking for parties
Playing with Barbies, wreck the Porsche before you give them the car key
Judgement to the monarchy, blessings to Paul McCartney
You called me a black Beatle, I'm either that or a Marley
(I don't smoke crack, motherfucker, I sell it)
I'm dressed in all black, this is not for the fan of Elvis
I'm aiming straight for your pelvis, you can't stomach me
You plan on stumping me? Bitch I’ve been jumped before you put a gun on me
Bitch I put one on yours, I'm Sean Connery
James Bonding with none of you niggas, climbing 100 mil in front of me
And I'm gonna get it even if you're in the way
And if you're in it, better run for Pete's sake
I heard the barbershops be in great debates all the time
Bout who's the best MC? sho, Jigga and Nas
Eminem, Andre 3000, the rest of y'all
New niggas just new niggas, don't get involved
And I ain't rocking no more designer shit
White T’s and Nike Cortez, this red Corvette's anonymous
I'm usually homeboys with the same niggas I'm rhyming with
But this is hip-hop, and them niggas should know what time it is
And that goes for Scope, Barrk,  and Nappy
Tyrant, Amema, Murkman , Niday
Slickk, Freeus, TKSF, Barrk0
I got love for you all but I'm tryna murder you niggas
Trying to make sure your core fans never heard of you niggas
They don't wanna hear not one more noun or verb from you niggas
What is competition? I'm trying to raise the bar high
Who tryna jump and get it? You're better off trying to skydive
Out the exit window of five G5s with five grand
With your granddad as the pilot he drunk as fuck trying land
With the hand full of arthritis and popping prosthetic leg
Bumpin Pac in the cockpit so the shit that pops in his head
Is an option of violence, someone heard the stewardess said
That your parachute is a latex condom hooked to a dread
West Coast

[Verse 33: Quikstik]
I got a lyrical shotty for your body
Blow off your left arm, call that Uzumaki
I walk around and steal your girl like Tamaki
Anime bars muhfucka, what you know bout me?
I'm dangerous, product of Parker and Octavius
Meaning I'm of a superior era thus
Step to me, peep my CDs
Adam WarRock and Wu-Tang is what you'll see

(Ayo, pass the fucking hummus! Shit's gonna expire soon, man!)

[Verse 34: Khroam]
Bars I got bars
Bitches at the bars
I drop bars
Fuck y'all, I got bars

[Verse 35: Halfadelic]
All I see is snitches
All I get is bitches
If you talk shit then yo bitches get put in ditches

[Verse 36: MSeafood]
Check, His palms, spaghetti
Knees are weak, arms, spaghetti
There’s vomit on his spaghetti already
Mom’s spaghetti, he’s nervous
He’s about to eat cold spaghetti
He’s not ready, but he keeps on forgetting
To reheat spaghetti, all the guests cry so load
He opens his mouth but spaghetti won't come out
He’s running out, of the house to get some more spaghetti
But he’s too late, the spaghetti shop’s closed, blaw

[Verse 37: Sdin1212]
You know what I don't give a fuck about luck
Finna silence the game like Saint John of Nepomuck
Wanna find talent, reach into my bag or tricks
But the only thing you'll find girl is some good ole dick

[Interlude: Halfadelic]
(Damnnnn son where did you find thattttt)
(10x)

[Verse 37: Mattw116]

Coming with these lyrical tactics I’m always active never passive Steady rhyming through my passage making these classics
Lines always fantastic the impact I make is massive
While other rappers don’t even get you out your seat like you Degrassi
Unlike these other people I actually have character
I'm not putting up a drake image, you’re just a character
I’m telling you the story of me and I’m the narrator
I’m giving you these bars so you see that I’m a rare master

[Verse 38: Tyrant]
Movin dope is my past present and Future
If my mound was any bigger you'd see me on Reuters
Cooking for two birds, only ones my bitch
Sit there and watch while I feast on this shit

[Verse 39: ZXQaos/Zade]
The rapture to rappers
Asshole assassin to ass’nance
Fuck sanction and passion
I’ll capture the masses of action from you faggots

[Verse 40: Time_Is_Illmatic]
I've got three whores spread on the bed and ready
With Double Ds I call them Ed Edd n Eddy
They call me a combo of Nas and Biggie
Had a menage with Nicki and Iggy
Flow so ill it needs a doctor
I've got two identities like Peter Parker
I rule like a Tyrant on the mic
And when I Scope You I'll put you in the dark no Streetlights
Got a girl with the ass of a Kardashian in the car dashin in
With the same flashin grin from the paper mag again

[Verse 41 : sbk]
Who wants to fuck with me?
Bitch i don't know
I'll leave you in a body bag
Looking like a burrito
That shit you spit is childish, Gambino
Im headed to the top, these haters trying to spoil it
They wouldn't be shit even if they were born in a toilet
I spit fire, step back cause its danger
Your mom should have aborted you with a coat hanger

[Verse 42: RESosa]
At first, reading this verse will make you sigh
Pay attention, this shit's  gonna inspire
Time isn't really Illmatic, is it
I'm gonna pop this bubble you think you're in, just like a zit
You will be forced to quit
Start beef with me, that's gonna be your first mistake
I will cook it, but I will not bake
For God's sake

[Verse 43: Kalsemari]
Yeah it’s still me, K-H-A LED
Tyrant on the same song I was on, no sony
I'll Scope You all, but no point in sniping fags
Top of the game, to reach me you need some hiking bags
I’ll sock a nigga and I don’t need nike to tell me to just do it
Following me like a fucking flock of sheeps, call it a Eid movement
But I don't walk a flock, I just throw flame and cock my Glocks
To shoot at the too many wanna-bes
And ex-bitches wanna castrate me like IMDB
They say I am creepy
But they haven't seen the real me, kalsemari
Israelis got more rocks on, than my fucking watch dawg
You be soft, I’m a rapper and a rockstar
Gangsters get Glocks, and pack more bars than a fucking gym
Macks for christmas, dicks for Christy if you're Johnny Sins
I rap this, you just sing it, perhaps you’re misfits
I take a dip in the pool and ya’ll follow like dipshits
Bitch I deserve my respect, but it doesn’t mean shit from fuckboys who lick dick
Not meant to get you twisted, but I like my bitches in C’s like Pimp did

[Verse 43 A_Master_EZ]

Money is time and time is money
I got time, so im rich, bitch
Fuck hoes and i don't pay them
Get all the bitches like faggot and fem'
Mess with me, lol, dont bother
Ur mom marries my dad, I dare you to step brother
Tell a bitch she got mirrors between her thighs
See my self there dont worry bout the size
With the mic im a dyke, cause no nigga can fuck with this
I see u bitch, she open wide, basically do the splits

[Verse 44: BDP29]
Fuck Gambino and anybody that love him

[Verse 45: ZXQaos/Zade]
Double the bars, rubble to stars
Run in the dark while I juggle a Park- er
Rhyme hard-er than darker the heart
Of a wet causer a' arson
If I was frozen inside of a moment
I'd blaze the flames of rage and motherfucking
Close it
But I'm as cold as snow coated boulders, no emotion
RG, I keep, total devotion

[Verse 46: Slickk]
I spit hot bars like I am forging steel
Get out of my lane with your boring appeal
I overshadow your whole style
So keep barking up that tree, I'll be here a while

[Verse 47: MyNamesCody]
Heyyyyy lol kk pz

[Verse 48: Quikstik]
(Had to come through with another one, hold up!)
Public Enemy mixed with YG, what’s that make me?
Lyrically I intimidate and educate thee
I’m the white boy knowing about COINTELPRO
So when I see racism I know how far back it goes
But y'all ain’t looking for conscious flows so
I tear up my home state harder than RTJ
When they came with Che and the Brusier Brigade
Tore up St. Andrew’s and left the smoldering decay
With Danny Brown putting the remains in an ash tray
Got me hyped enough to punch Floyd Mayweather in the face
Knock his teeth out and call it a day
Except Manny would have my head so let me collect it
I see the bodies of wack MCs let me inspect it
You hear this shit and you gotta respect it
You gonna re-read this shit and say
Damn Quikstik wrecked it!

[Verse 49: LAzY]
I come down from a loose high
When I walk through you know these geese fly
I keep it real cuz that’s what I was born to do
You call yourself bad bitch but i'v met worse than you
I come up with the weed like shottas
Big like poppa I tell them nada for the prada
They come back wit the pistol and shoot gratata
But believe me i’m not fazed i’m not bothered
Keeping it real but always feeling managed
Bounce back from rockets with no collateral damage
Put your whole goddamn career in a casket
Do I love her I tell her don’t ask it
She’ll be set up for disappointment
I ain’t her shrink I don’t take appointments
They come at me with potions for my emotions
In rap I get promotions move through the ranks without motion


[Verse 50: JWTM]
I'm not even much on the forums, but an artist on YouTube
Say like a god to these people reppin' ether making London Bridge burning to make on suffocate and lose
That's too harsh for me to talk like that, guess y'all caught me rapping like a newstyled Drake
Not Edward Scissorhands, but i'll cut a bitch off if she tries to steal my fucking resume, dawg!
Yeah, shit spitting in circles of nervous, attention, and criminals  confused about the power spoken out the uvula.....
Those dots were for a pause on the beat if I screwed up and left my richest rhymes in locker, think that I forgot the code again
Sometimes i'm tired of being the ultimate and undefeated rap battler at my school
Because of what I spit automatic sunk Titanic number two, if I feel blue don't mean I always sing blues, double entendre
Too messed up to think straight with the doctor, that a triple enten- DRE!
Know y'all are wondering, "where in the hell is JWTM coming up with these new rhymes, came from nowhere
This guy need to chill out before Eminem turns into Slim Shady and makes a roast fair!"
Punishment was taught from him, guess i'm spitting as his offspring and i'm Drake's younger brother
So I should follow in there footsteps, it's 8:08 but where the bass at??? Continuing to build a Martian mask for my rock band
The man that has a verse after me named @Translucent and y'all might think I'm a nuisance to look into future
And knew who the next verse was but the truth is I keep adding verses when turning superior
Just like something I never saw, I don't wanna make a scene!
Pockets running empty but my money grows on trees!
Someone annotate my lyrics, justify the means
Twist it if you want to, it'll haunt you in your dreams!


[Verse 51: YoDawg111]
One verse to make it up top with the GOATs
I’ll give you my two cents with my cock in your girl’s throat
Death multiplies by threes. SDVG, RedMasta , and Danger-Ru$$
Wonder who the fourth will be to bite the dust
Focused on the top with the attention span of a 5 year old
Listen for six seconds and my flow will knock you out cold
Waking up at 7 AM the day is looking bright
Go out for coffee after I ate out your girl all night
Every day, stay trapped with that nine
Get laid like it’s my job, hook up with another dime
Every other rapper taking an L in this event
Been in the game since I was 12 with everyone else underneath
I’m sending bullets Darren Wilson’s way in a baker’s dozen
Put a fourteenth in him to remind him that he’s nothin
And just when you thought my 15 minutes of fame is up
I’ll spit another 16 to show you why you all suck

[Verse 52: ChamKoopa]
I’m killing this website like I’m trynna get signed
All ya fuckers doing is running from the feds, right?
So nobody here? The game’s mine, I guess that’s fine
This cypher is over, you just missed the dead line
And before me, there’s just a fucking dead line
If you suck at rhymin', you should go to bed cryin'
Didn’t your mommas told you it was a bad time?

[Verse 53: Cordel]
Killin these bitches like im Michael Vick
I know I’m the best so hop of my dick
And yo “Bad Bitch” look like my shit
And she got those pink pussy lips
Watchout for gun cuz im murkin niggas down
TU TU TU is how my gun sounds
You faggot ass niggas dont know bout murder
I’m the best in the game just like Richard Sherman
Bobby Shmurda fucks males and his faggot ass “gang"
When I see this bitch ima hit him with a bang
GS9 like to fuck guys in the ass
While Glo Gang looks in the dumpster for cash
At least I’m honest to the rap game
I’m just tellin the truth so who you gonna blame?

[Verse 54: Akuma]
Apparently users dont know what four bars is
Typin raps in the cypher like they about to get the biz
When problably no one will listen to this
Although keep rapping cause you never really know

[Verse 55: ZXQaos/Zade]
Yo, I'm the hardest
Hardly Harlem, the holy hound of darkness
I hold artists by the cart'lage, causing carnage
Hip hop's become concerning
Expect me to purchase this version
Of the game?
Fuck's sake, where's the murder?
Anyways, I'm the next thane, wreck lames
A neck pain in the best way
10's 8, but I'm 5' 9"
Cause I write rhymes as the light's lime
While the mike's mine
I can swipe life-lines;
Oh, and Zade rhymes with blade
It's why I'm named as the fucking
Renegade
Of this yphercay
(Spoken) Yeah yeah, 16th bar, still hard

[Verse 56: Pakyed]
I need to get this off my chest, like women with breast cancer
I have a fetish to develop AIDS, just to make it spread faster
Fuck a sexy dime on her legs! See, I ain't what I eat
She got a Sixty-Nine on the test, So I gave her the D

[LAST VERSE: streetlights]
Eminem is trash
Chris brown is too
Kanye is a god
And so is Tyrant

Outro: Quikstik
RG, MOTHERFUCKER, FUCK WHO YOU THOUGHT IT WAS![Produced by: Oddisee]

[Intro]
La-la-la-la-la
I know I invited you, I still want you to leave now
This is a whole long thing just telling you to leave my mind, leave

[Verse 1: Open Mike Eagle]
I woke up down in this dungeon
I've made mistakes in my judgements
I've built you up in my head this is my prayer for your reduction
You're not my aunt, uncle or cousin
Not your nephew or your husband
You think just because you buzzin' you got licence but you doesn't
I hugged you like a glo-worm, come down now cause it's your turn
I ain't got nothing but time I like that long haul to that slow burn
I did too much of my homework
Killed my confidence with this research
I've put people on pedestals ego's reaction is knee-jerk
I'm trying to work on my weakness
It's not all roses and peaches, it's no secret
I've found my self in a funk for a whole weekend
Over email failures and DMs
"Did they get that shit? Should I re-send?"
What should I do when I see them?
Talk all soft and passive like Cleveland
Even wise men can go mindless
Voluntarily rocking them blinders
It generates all this shyness calling some other human your highness
They forgot about when they punched clocks
With Capri Suns in their lunchbox
Bad haircut with those sunspots
Drank fruit punch and wore dumb socks, yeah!

[Hook]
You're not my moms, you're not my father
You're not my food, you're not my water
Not your earth, you're not my lover
What the fuck is my problem?
It's a prayer for the American religion
You're not my food, you're not my java
Not my nurse, you're not my doctor
Not my priest, you're not my lama
What the fuck is my problem?
It's a prayer for the American religion

[Verse 2]
It's not worth my attention
Let alone all of these mentions
This first time is a warning, the next move is suspension
I got my own lapses in thinking, my processes were stinking
You're not Gandhi, you're not Yoda, you're not President Lincoln
Give a fuck if you was Oprah, Wolf Blitzer, or Al Roker
If you try to put yourself over I'll laugh at you like The Joker
This Hellfyre is my culture, put magic all in these cold words
I'm you as the slogan put up mirrors instead of these posters
Watch me smash all of these idols got all my own heavyweight title
There's no upper tier, we're all peers unless y'all want to be rivals
Talent's just a foundation rapped in festivals and in basements
If I ever lost my head I got good friends to replace it
Gives a fuck if you're on TV, you still poop and you still pee-pee
You sat down and got started not knowing there wasn't no TP
You got up then and you waddled
That shit might happen tomorrow
Whether you're a ball player, a stage actor, or international model
I don't care, neither should no one, I'll say that shit to Hulk Hogan
Obama down to Joe Rogan
Head of the studio that made Frozen
My brain is variable tape speed, SubGenius or hayseed
Try waving your resume, all of a sudden I can't read, yeah!

[Bridge]
Get your name, fame can make you evil
And that's the shame cause we done lost so many people
It gets ingrained and we start behaving like a sheep do
This song is a prayer you should aim it where you need to
When you say it they believe you
This is a prayer and you should aim it where you need to

[Hook]The truth is your thought and not what you said
Cause language is prison for whats in your head
The thought is a mountain of matter
The word is a shred of whats in your head I said
The truth isnt guilty or innocence pled
Language is prison for whats in your head
The thoughts and the feelings are living the symbols are dead
The symbols are simple

Hear me hear me hear me clearly
Disappear you cheery weird things
Silly god-fearing eery dreary golemns
Bout to strip the gears from your steering column
Periodically empty feedbags
Feather dust the brain must defrag
Kill the cheap ass hiss on your tape recorders
Can't fight transitions with tanks and mortars
Or troop formations with ranks and orders
No borders landlocked peninsula
This is not for your grandfathers band of brothers
New land discovered, maps not the territrory
Cause everything said is a fairy tale
A story told from someone’s glory hole
Boring old facts with injected flavor
All the good metdata’s reflected later

The truth is your thought and not what you said
Cause language is prison for whats in your head
The thought is a mountain of matter
The word is a shred of whats in your head I said
The truth isnt guilty or innocence pled
Language is prison for whats in your head
The thoughts and the feelings are living the symbols are dead
The symbols are simple

Cyrano de bergerac to observe the facts
Cause our everyday words are flat
As the earth in a dark aged almanac
Dissolve the facts in passion
Exaggerated actions
Massive men and yellow-eyed dragons
No bad skin and idiosyncrasies
I hear the sound is the video synced?
Repeat the phrase again it should be the same right
The night’s allure obscured by the daylight
Aim right into the dark for missed marks
It starts as a word and turns into a spark that’s absurd
It merges with all of the urges within
That lurk in your skin
Reversing the purpose again
And then its a circus experience worthless
Until its a verse that a serious serpent can spin
When you’re all alone you are an animal
The words i’m saying now mean nothing more than
Meow to an animal
When you’re all alone you are the cat you are the phone
You are an animal
The words im saying now mean nothing more than
Meow to an animal

We live in a thousand dimensions
How is it condensed in the tension of time
How do the characters written on a line
Help you get an image of the vision in my mind
How is it combined
Designed
Alligned
When it is confined
Like a human limited divine
We can only see three sides
The reverse side bottom and the top side hide
Just out of view
Beyond our six senses but true
The devil’s in the details
God’s in the clue
Amused
Removed
We choose
To focus on hues that are broken and bruised
Cause we are open to choose
An alternate frequency

The truth is your thought and not what you said
Cause language is prison for whats in your head
The thought is a mountain of matter
The word is a shred of whats in your head I said
The truth isnt guilty or innocence pled
Language is prison for whats in your head
The thoughts and the feelings are living the symbols are dead
The symbols are simple

When you’re all alone you are the cat you are the phone
You are an animal
The words im saying now mean nothing more than
Meow to an animal[Verse 1]

I've been following my creed since a teenager
Writing in more run on sentences than the dialogue up in Speed Racer
See we ain't new to this
You can tell how we copy floppy computer disks
I'm a futurist so I don't rock a crucifix
Keep it deep in the dirt on some Rosicrucian shit
I'm on that free thinking doubletalk
My people's out there like NASA's space shuttle walk
Cultivating epiphanies out of subtle thoughts
My people stay serving and steady crossing the line
'Til the judges call double fault
We got a secret though
We used to keep it low
And them same judges is tighter than some needle nose pliers
Time to let the people know
Through the wires the higher ups keep below the surface
I haven't seen him but I heard it
And who would mislead us on purpose?

[Hook]

Hellfyre is the club
Swim is the team
Blowed is the project, the free thinkers scream
For whatever they want, they feel free
So they can have whatever they want

[Verse 2]

Keep it close to the vest like Pakistan
Don't watch the mic, the other one is the magic hand
It's not happenstance
From where you're at I can touch you like Plastic Man
A little oral projection a little astral man
Clap your unshackled hands
Partying with kings 'til the whole damn castle dance
And we can do like a wave do
Who lit the candles that the people in the cave drew
Fire lights in from a mountain top, praise due to who?
My light level stays through the roof
Keep the black and white pebble like Locke on the beach
Here to hold 'em to the light right and frightened people see red

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

Weightless, is the keys on a Casio
All the secrets in the world were explained
On that Dinosaurs episode called 'The War on Pistachio'
It ain't my fault you didn't get it then
It was all their divisors the dividend the quotient
Sitting there just as plain as the ocean
I should have never brought it up
I got an army full of thirty something misfits
With quick wits that swing a mean ass coffee cup
Getting ill on the free range chicken parts
In the kitchen or the woods with the Wiccan arts
I just say that shit because it sounds cool
I ain't got a clue about the crown jewels
I'll be at the crib acting glib
Fixing my kids bib watching Party Down, fool

[Hook][Verse 1]
First step is intention, second step is a glance
Then divine intervention
Mixing science religion
Pretending like we giants
Promise I was the biggest
For the lovers of dancing, this is color enhancing
Two strangers passing on the metro, what were the chances
People walk into circles
Every audience listens
They taking turns judging, everybody got issues
I be moving my feet and on varied tables I'm eating on
Up, we're cutting a rug, was it something I said
Put on Erykah's album, I can tear up a mountain
Get your eagle on, naw, more peregrine falcon
They sit in the darkness
They connect they courting naked in different apartments
Don't say nothing that's awkward
Take them up on that offer
And you'll be partnered up for life flying up in a saucer
And they trying to cat daddy, I'm hella allergic

[Hook]
I've been doing my research, so I know that move
I studied them all
I seen that swing
I've been watching it for hours, so don't get too close
She kick real high
They swing real low
I done been in that position so I know that spell
I read that book
I know those lines, I see 'em coming back around

[Verse 2]
First step is intention, second step is a glance
Then divine intervention
Mix of science religion
Environmentalist dance, make 'em sign a petition
For the lovers of dancing, this is color enhancing
Two strangers passing on the freeway, what were the chances
Don't be acting embarrassed, that's the whackest awareness
They get it in before their skin starts cracking and tearing
Heaven's not for the living
Ordained reverend and comparative monster religion
Sit in my pews
Cruise ship in the Pacific, we can bend the rules
And do the Transylvania boogie to forbidden blues
She did the peanut butter jelly, ain't nobody looking
The soul train line's long and it's sloppy and crooked
The chicken noodle soup and poodle skirt and hula hooping
The bullshit's twerking, you wanna see the Juicy Fruit
Ain't no keeping a distance, murdered the shadow

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
We can do it for safety like a factory worker
Trying to balance a beam
Skirt's floating cause she's twirling around in a dream
It's the easiest hustle
You catch a swing and then you squeeze your trapezius muscles
It takes a year or two
Your old friends you done found yourself getting nearer to
Who wants to hear the truth
Well you can do the wop
And plug us in, we got it poppin' in computer shops
First step is intention, second step is a glance
Then divine intervention
Mixing science religion
Pretending like we giants
Promise I was the biggest
For the lovers of dancing, this is color enhancing
Two strangers passing in the hallway, what were the chances[Produced by Blockhead]

[Verse 1: Open Mike Eagle]
Look one day I won't even need a barber
I'll buy a new jeep and sleep in a pizza parlor
Every cheap cigar is the best they could probably do
Limited resources plus other hobbies too
Imagine bad guys tied to fire wagons
Also apple pies and spies and sky dragons
Sociopaths choke who they supposed to hug
Midnight vultures love appropriating culture clubs
I like one clean tape fuck the overdub
And then I record seventeen singing parts
Deep yoga love supposed to be a secret art
Downward dog, hips straight with the feet apart
Still the beating heart rebuilt the leaning part
Cheap thrilled, feet build and kill with a cuisinart
The prodigal done is home from the lecture tour
I count three, who's the fourth table setting for?

[Sample]

[Verse 2: MarQ Spekt]
They saying Spekt, why you chewin' like a rabid dog?
If he can't keep it what the hell you let him have it for?
That's your fault but y'already lack the gravitas
These phantom bars leave 'em floating like the planet Mars
A saboteur and booby traps throughout the catalogue
Stab 'em in the stomach, lift the blade and twist the handle off
Yeah, then leave some munchies for the weed heads
I like it better when y'all listen more, speak less
The look in her eyes will tell you that she eat fresh
Murdered the punani feeling guiltier than G-Dep
That's why they see em, he won't even give 'em a look
Casting lines off that rusty old fisherman hook
Kind of shocked they fell for the newest trick in the book
'Cuz it ain't really nothing more than a considerate jux
From a good polite kid who used a mask and a gun
Told his pops you only out to get that capital one
Ain't mean to kill him, we was just having some fun
Found his body vacuum sealed like a package of drugs
Praise a nimrod, when he blast immaculate slugs
And showed no honor for your honor turn his back to the judge
That's why they stay being ugly and repugnant
I almost beat 'em half to death with a drumstick
Save your assumptions, they really ain't want shit
And keep it hard as three pretty mouths on one dick

[Sample]

[Verse 3: Aesop Rock]
He got the beetles in his pinky
Every leader venal
The face line ate, I ain't street legal
Lead a pale horse in a ear tag some deer ticks
A winged horse to a queen's air strip, flares lit
Cut his own hair, chew his own chain
Might bang on a bucket with a lucite cane
Screws loose, quicker than a pit crew up fish news
Eighty-eight with a eighty-six feud[?]
Litter in the street, tricky slither in the mildew
Swamp thing, chop chop [?] mosh king
POP go his temper, knock knock the fenders
Peck bound plots under cosmic embers
I'm a hot mess get your squad sequestered
Dock death, sleep on a bed of hot cobwebs
Freak with a set of goth potheads
Bleed rocks and fail smog checks

[Sample][Verse 1: Busdriver]

We’re not gonna quit, that’s the popular myth of our ancestors
Wallow in, drop to the pit with a sock on my prick
And my hands severed, I got one option to pick in an ominous grip
Of a planned centure , I take it cause I'm no apologist
For the chocolate chips that make a man's center, I’m where a hollow abyss
And an obelisk can stand together. While you’re out talkin' that shit
Those innocous crips they fan embers at the book burnings
When I jot down the script, my god is a bitch who’s transgendered
Up and dropped off a fifth on a modular synth, it’s a great gesture, nigga
(the opt of a gist when a cop is a fit for a clansmember)
It’s on the top of your list, a pop of the clip withstands pressure and squeeze
(Now shot to shift?) (my...) was a damn treasure, and you are lost to the mist
Cause you're not equipped to be man's successor
I'm the next step when the postular swiss leave tropical fish that swam together
(But you hate front me cause the bottle is thick) and my skin colour is a tan leather
But I can start you over, let me paint you, I can paint you ’cause I can never hate you

[Hook: Open Mike Eagle]
Let me paint you, I wrote a riddle in a dream
And it came true
Riding around town selling bottles of this oowee
From the moon like these other fools can’t do
Let me paint you, I wrote a riddle in a dream
And it came true
Riding around town selling bottles of this oowee
From the moon like these other fools can’t do

[Verse 2: Open Mike Eagle]

They handed us the precious stones
To keep your flesh and bones dancing in infected zones
And that philosopher’s rock is just a stepping stone
The higher goal is putting stutters in your metronomes
And we can lock this whole vibe in a quarantine
My brothers hover in the sky like they war machine
The first moment's like a high dose of Thorazine
That when the chorus sings I swear to life I see an old forest Brontasaurus scene
And three enormous kings, the Eye of Horus, start recording while hornet stings
My vital organs vibrate like a super-string
Spin the black circle till it sprouts Mini Cooper wings
We got the doubts so had to slow it down to bulletspeed
And fast forward as back where it used to be before king Cooper introduces you to user-read
Keep a journal ’cause my future is confusing me, it’s looping beautifully

[Hook]

[Bridge: Busdriver]
Paint me a comet that I've never seen
One that can’t be mistaken for anything
Likethe center of the sun
Paint me a comet that I've never seen
One that can’t be mistaken for anything

(I was born a king
I was born a king)

[milo]
I sat by my secret window to draft a thesis
On stretch limos as they pertain to black Jesus
And nascent bimbos destined to consume crack pieces
And why come it’s never gringos who lack visas
To work food trucks and make tasty snack tazers
I felt its reverberations through my hipbone
And I spoke the truth through wide nigga lips syndrome
That’s why accidental racism was just a thorn to me
Mike Eagle keeps telling me that I was born a king
They could not possibly afford the thing that they came to seek
They try to tame the meak, they’d have to pain their feet
And speak daintily, they couldn’t pay off these plaintiffs with their plane receipts
And I have found purpose from the pain in me
The days will pass and my curls will begin to look more like a crown
And I hear Alex Haley's ghost speak in Morse code without a sound[Produced by: Oddisee]

I got my own lapses in thinking, my processes were stinking
You're not Gandhi, you're not Yoda, you're not President Lincoln
Give a fuck if you was Oprah, Wolf Blitzer, or Al Roker
If you try to put yourself over I'll laugh at you like The Joker
This Hellfyre is my culture, put magic all in these cold words
I'm you as the slogan put up mirrors instead of these posters
Watch me smash all of these idols got all my own heavyweight title
There's no upper tier, we're all peers unless y'all want to be rivals
Talent's just a foundation rapped in festivals and in basements
If I ever lost my head I got good friends to replace it
Gives a fuck if you're on TV, you still poop and you still pee-pee
You sat down and got started not knowing there wasn't no TP
You got up then and you waddled
That shit might happen tomorrow
Whether you're a ball player, a stage actor, or international model
I don't care, neither should no one, I'll say that shit to Hulk Hogan
Obama down to Joe Rogan
Head of the studio that made Frozen
My brain is variable tape speed, SubGenius or hayseed
Try waving your resume, all of a sudden I can't read, yeah!

[Bridge]
Get your name, fame can make you evil
And that's the shame cause we done lost so many people
It gets ingrained and we start behaving like a sheep do
This song is a prayer you should aim it where you need to
When you say it they believe you
This is a prayer and you should aim it where you need to

[Hook]I'm sorry

Eric I'm sorry I spazzed in front of those battle nerds
After the judges said you won I tugged your mustache afterwards
VerBS I really should have advertised your pedicab
Regan I'm sorry I get haircuts that you've already had
James I'm sorry for judging the word bitch in your rap hooks
And when we went on tour I never let you use my MacBook
I'm sorry for mumbling, I record with my mouth dry
And Alph guy I'm sorry I didn't take you to South by
I'm a big fool, Milo you're my touring homie shit's cool
Apologies to your parents they hate it when you miss school
Taurus I'm sorry for holding beats in that folder
So Regan had to ask you for them shits over and over
I don't deserve such nice pals, big shout to my wife now
Cause she home with my kid right now, bet his crazy ass is on time-out[Verse 1]
It's a shelter for battered artists
With nightly contests to see who's been smacked the hardest
But only press half the charges
Cause we love the punishment like any other passive martyrs
It's the Stockholm syndrome
A house full of runaways that's not gon' get home
It's not where overly macho men go
We killed bravado
With a steel Silverado
Twelve step program for pills or the bottle
And right down the hill from a brothel
Sorry sex addicts
Sometimes the party gets crackin'
Groovin' to a soundtrack of REM sadness
(Fiesta!)
We use the term very loosely
We play bid whist and serve cherry juice drink
Dr. Serengeti has a Burberry mood ring
And goes on rants like an absurd Gary Busey

[Hook]
Ain't no party like an Art Rap Party
Cause an Art Rap Party's so smart(x4)

[Verse 2]
With or without 'shrooms
A boom bap odyssey
Arguing how to record the two-track properly
(Hey, yo, who's that?)
It's new rap possibly
Fucking up my discussion of Bloom's Taxonomy
What's the point I was making?
Debating on whether Barack has joined with the Masons
Various platforms are poised for the taking
Like whether or not 'Pac was anointed as sacred
(Two queens just walked in)
With Grade A faces
In low cut bald fades and gray laced Asics
To get 'em you need to be talking paid vacations
Or have original game like James A. Naismith
(One of 'em's knock-kneed)
The other walks pigeon toed
(One brought Saki)
The other brought dinner rolls
(One wears red locs)
The other's light indigo
(One likes Death Note)
The other likes Ninja Scroll

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
C'mon raise your glasses up
As Regan recites a page from Britannica
On the life of Jack Kerouac
Killing everybody like Iraq air attacks
I know you'd like to write scary tracks
Princess Superstar would like her mascara back
Somebody spins Paris Zax
Bringing folks together like the twins in the Parent Trap
Around a Fat Tire keg
We're rappers discussing what other rap writers said
White Rabbit made a wallet out of black spiders' legs
Then we all rap about it 'til the campfire's dead

[Hook][Intro]
So long
So long now
So long now
So long now

[Verse 1]
I’m far away from my house, wrote this song in the hotel room
On a day of the show, got canceled, now this room feels like Bellevue
Jupiter’s got twelve moons and there’s life forms on a couple of them
Give a fuck if my plans fell through, if I’m deep purple or pale blue
So please circle the right answer on this questionnaire I’m gon’ mail you
Haven’t we yet made a real connection or is this simply a prelude?
Whats this centuries Quaalude?
What’s the next millennium’s molly pill?
And my body feels like sunlight, ‘bout to run right through this poppy field
So my eyes burn and my nose run and my skin itches like fire
Only rappers with sinus troubles could ever enter my cypher
Every sentence that I write, my muse, feels like it could be tighter
There’s a small chance that we can’t connect ‘cause we’re too differently wired

[Hook]
So long
So long now
So long now
So long now
We’ll dig, we’ll still
Build big pretty bridges
We’ll dig, we’ll still
Build big pretty bridges
We’ll dig, we’ll still
Build big pretty bridges

[Verse 2]
What the fuck is you doing here? I done plugged up this computer gear
And I’m ‘bout to sweat in this laptop, the drive here was like five years
I swear I only made one gas stop, I’m the Batman of the minivan
And my plan’s choking these rap fans who think rap shows are like Disneyland
What the fuck is you doing here with no roller coasters, no souvenirs?
Sometimes the shit’s second nature, other times it feels super weird
There’s some faces here I done seen before, seen people dancing, seen people bored
Now I’m reaching out for your hand so you can understand what I’m speaking for
But don’t sweep the floor, but don’t wipe the bar, leave them glasses right where they are
Look at me when I talk to you cause this not some shit I’m sleepwalking through
Not some shit that y’all can wipe away, a game some of y’all like to play
I’m dialing into U access and U this signal will not decay

[Hook][Verse 1]
All I hear is haters when I walk out the house
Cause everyone that's positive talks like a mouse
And nothing seems to wash the taste of salt out my mouth
So I stumble through the front door then I fall on the couch
What brought this about?
Me giving too much credence to my walls and the shout
Fuck 'em all, they don't count
Not even a small amount in the grand scheme
Cause people want you to join 'em in a bad dream
Miserable motherfuckers are quick to start a tag team
I was pretty close to tapping out, they almost had me

[Hook]
Then I found that bright green light behind my eyes
I found that bright green light behind my eyes
I found that bright green light to my surprise
I found that bright green light behind my eyes

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I feel like I don't get the worth I deserve
When other people's judgments are not worth my concern
Cause there is not a human on this earth that deserves
Authority to box me 'til I'm dirt in an urn
So fuck your swag and fuck your swerve
And put the mic down, it's not your turn
I got a green light cause I just burned
I earned it every Thursday night on the curb
Where they light that herb and fight with words
And lightning strikes occur
But when I see that green light in my mind it's like a blur

[Hook][Verse 1: Open Mike Eagle]
They call me crazy
Cause I know who draws the pretty pictures they see
He tryna chase me
This is the last straw
I ain't no hay seed
Won't take his mask off cause he don't wanna face me
They want me dead cause I know the truth
I can show 'em proof and put computers in the voting booth
I know the dude
He keep a stolen egg from a golden goose
And passes out crack and crystal meth to the local youth
I got a folder full of intel that told me how he kicks whales
Pulls pig tails and hid grails and runs up in the get-wells and snatches up the piss pails
And puts 'em in a vaporizer just to make the chem trails
What an unclean asshole
I'mma sanitize the unclean hand for sure
He 30 years deep in the killing biz
But I ain't worried about telling you who the villain is

[Hook]
Y'all know the answer
So all the Free Thinkers can all throw your hands up
Ain't no coincidence
This shit isn't random
I'm blaming everything on Cobra Commander
X2

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
Go to hell
Gayest shit I ever did was let a nigga braid my hair in jail
I ain't frontin', no I ain't lyin'
But I roll up, had my shit in zig-zag designs
Layin' in the bunk
Stay by myself
On my own
Up in that bitch with no help
I'm never on a phone, fuck a TV
I don't play cards
My nigga don't play me
Put a boiled egg
In a bag of chips
Crush the chips up
Put the egg and then I shook
Don't know how to play chess
I don't read books
I don’t go to rec
I grab you by your neck
But in my mental
I hear them instrument
So I'm in the bunk
Writing with them little ass pencils
And I ain't got no answers
So mother fuck Cobra Commander

[Hook] [2x][Intro: Open Mike Eagle]
We have a fuckin', uh, incredible show for you tonight
Pardon me for saying "Fuckin'" on network television—
I'm not gonna have this job for long—It's Exile!
It's me, it's you. These are our guests
Let's go. Yeah

[Open Mike Eagle]
I gave up and became a Spotify-er
Paying myself a fraction of a penny playing "Qualifiers"
I'm looking up and I'm stuck in a Chucky movie
Saying yucky shit for chuckles like it's Lucky Louie
So somebody better cancel me
Before I get a chance to screen this ass-naked dance routine
It's dark comedy, cold as a soldier's stare
I've been exposed, so now the LOLs is my over-wear
And I'm a polar bear with words for a fancy song
I think it's the first verse from Little Miss Can't Be Wrong
Fuck you, I like the Spin Doctors
Is that dude Finn's father or just an impostor?
The new internet thing's to be pretend awkward
Non-prescription, thick-rimmed frames and rented gym lockers
I'm a rapper, we lament being broke
All the comics get money, but they spend it on coke
You can watch us on the newsfeeds
Fucking y'all's mornings up
Until America admits that it likes dogs more than us
And I can see the Super Bowls of the future:
The Ferguson blacks vs. Missouri State Troopers
The privacy rights vs. the personal computers
Concussion researchers vs. university boosters
I graduated college, I purchased all the extra books
I'm supposed to be living in a house with a breakfast nook
Joke's on me, though
All this cheap alcohol and no Coke Zero
Ashamed how proximity kills yo heroes
Hey, yo, no poking, I'm still woke, Cee-Lo
Yeah, It's all ripped from the headlines
I'm all outta options like a Crip on the red line
I got a deadline, before I never had a deal
Stormed out of business meetings, slipped on mass banana peels
I should probably shut my stupid mouth
Shirtless in a fur hat and Vladimir Putin pout
And North Korea's got practice missiles
And I still check Yahoo cause we both got attachment issues
Our Congress moves just like a cult could
Invade Iraq 15 times in my adulthood
And we quit asking for the reasons
And clicked the Constitution's terms of service agreements
We're dreaming from sundown to high noon
And woke up by U2 albums all in your iTunes
And it's close to a all out war
With kids being murdered just for being black and tall outdoors
They respond to demonstrations wearing kevlar briefs
When the main problem is nobody respects our grief
They say if it bends it's funny, if it breaks it ain't though
I still got broke pockets and trying to host the Late Show
Recording it every night, but I don't know where the tape go
Homeless fashionistas tell me everything that they know
Yeah, you got a style
Tie them fancy sandals up, smile
You on the NSA's candid cameras, now
I'm in a church basement learning Shotokan
I saw Jesus taking a selfie and I photobombed
And dude better tag me
A little recognition makes me do better gladly
Like this one time when I got booed at a track meet
In a Hellfyre Club sweater for two letter athletes
One for regret dreams, one for most suppressed team
Pressure valve gets released and sprays like a jet stream
Karl Kani’s and Z Cavaricci’s from Chess King
K-Mart name brands were the least interesting
I appreciated presidential speeches on the West Wing
I never had wet dreams or piloted an X-Wing
I'm still terrible at being sarcastic black
My man Exile, he knows what I'm laughing at
My man Toy-Light, he knows what I'm laughing at
The studio audience knows what I'm laughing at

[Outro: Open Mike Eagle]
Laughing at all types of shit
I laugh at, um, CNN. I don't know why
That might be an issue; that might be a problem actually
It's not, it's not a humorous channel, you know what I mean?
It's not trying to compete with Comedy Central
If anything, it's trying to compete with Headline News
Which I'm pretty sure is like the same company
Or it's trying to compete with, uh, MSNBC kinda
MSNBC is blue and to the left
CNN is red, white, and black, and in the middle
And Fox News is bright red and hollerin', and on the right
And there's an elephant and a donkey
And then an eledonkeyphant. A donkaphant
Uh, a helladonkaphant. Shit[Verse 1]

Dark comedy cold as the ocean
Add a lol cause nobody seems to know when I'm joking
For those who haven't heard of me
I'm bad at sarcasm so I work in absurdity
On that laugh to keep from crying tip
Rap like Wyatt vs Chet in Weird Science
Cause my genre's all hack
Actions cliche, melodrama falls flat
And everybody's getting fired
I flew off the handle, and boy are my arms tired
Rap songs like Patch Adams
Shadyac thought of it as art 'til they laughed at it
Rap songs like Steven Wright
Monotone drone, people wonder if he breathing right

[Hook]

We got that dark dark comedy
That dark d-dark dark dark d-dark comedy

[Verse 2]

Cause rappers ruin the punchline
Like stand up club hecklers doing the punchline
Cause I'll tweet on Sunday morning like a preacher at a church
Because my true religion is the thirst
It's like Burn After Reading
The dark ugly truth that addicts learn at the meetings
Sean already wrote about the modern man
The only other option is the plight of the hologram
It's dark comedy, I would've called it black
If another dude calls me a racist, I'mma snap
Cause Google knows what's in my cabinet
And Facebook logs all of my favorite sandwiches
And what they need the damn data for
To analyze the shit they'd need a whole 'nother labor force
Cause I'm addicted to my celly
And I gotta have some coffee in my belly, ya smell me

[Verse 3]
There's mad shootings on the news
Unless it's in the Chi, cause blacks and mexicans can die
I swear we live in John Lennon songs
Matching track suit like dude in Royal Tenenbaums
It's like the In Living Color cast
We laugh and try not to wish death on the upper class
I'd like to run up on the Koch Brothers
And beat 'em with a garden hose made of old rubber
Give 'em rock bottoms and a cold stone stunner
Drop some cold butter on 'em from the skyscraper
Pistol whip 'em with the handle of a lightsaber
Cut 'em with rice paper, chuckle like a wiseacre
Instead think of something sarcastic, black
My man Nocan knows what I'm laughing at
My man Busdriver knows what I'm laughing at
My man Milo knows what I'm laughing at[Verse 1]
The rejected stone is now the cornerstone
It’s in the sky in chemtrails from a Dorner drone
There’s a war between feds and some Jesus
The winner ghost-wrote the pledge of allegiance
Niggas afraid to touch mason jars
There’s worse shit on your identification card
For any man to ever say another man is irrelevant
Is an ant trying to grow a trunk and dance like an elephant
So Mister Frankenstein, dead your experiment
Body so African and head so American
And here’s the deed to the motherfuckin’ promise land
A pound of weed and the pretty lyrics to rock ‘em in

[Pre-Hook]
One whole shattered into dividends
They’re connected by the rhythm and blood
Two extremes of faithful and paranoid
But neither ever really saw what it was
Every step a man is ever making
Was only past playing in another man’s original dream
And you keep seeing yesterday ‘cause its all gonna happen again

[Verse 2]
Brand new once again, one year later (its all gonna happen again)
Like never before, all over again, one year after (it’s all gonna happen again)
The rejected stone is now the cornerstone
It’s in the sky in chemtrails from a Dorner drone
Niggas afraid to touch mason jars
But there’s worse shit on your identification card

[Hook]
I couldn't change your life but I wanted to
I wanted you to hear nothing else after this
The ego is the dirtiest of private parts
A spirit boner never sit unless its six feet high
I want this shit to do what it doesn’t do
Disregard other people’s choices as if they ain’t cool
When don’t nobody seem to know what to do
Except write these words
And record these words
Memorize these words
‘Til they get on our nerves
And we learn to never wait for what we think we deserve
Cause the money and the karma is imaginary
You don’t believe in your arteries and capillaries
But they still work
Nobody asked you to
Nobody not once ever asked you to
And they wouldn't till they found a way to benefit

[Pre-Hook]

[Outro]
It’s all gonna happen again
It’s all gonna happen again
It’s all gonna happen again
Everyone's still under arrest
Even the cops, army, and kids

[Hook][Verse 1: Open Mike Eagle]
Button my uniform for this stupidness
If I wore a suit and a tie, I'd make a noose with it
Kill me, kill me, kill me dead
Spill my head juices open
Choke me, fill me with lead
I won't even raise a limb cause I been afraid
I walk like a zombie and I swim like a renegade
Favorite nightmare is ten degrees centigrade
I only know five songs and they're all Gucci's "Lemonade"!
I'm at a tender age when compared
To a dead rotten deer, when the shins get ensnared
And it dies in the trap, but the trap gets forgot
I'm a god in a trap, and it snaps on the spot?
And the party people clap
Till the gavel gets dropped
Then we're all sentenced to eternal damnation
All of us
Especially you

[Hook: Stik]
Ain't nothing promised in life but death and taxes
No time to rest, stepping over the mattress
Best distractions, collecting protecting fractions
Looking like success. Overdressed in the casket
Feeling resurrected, blowing breath into ashes
It's anybody's guess. Can't connect to the masses
Felt it in my chest. Hope that I left established
God directs the steps. Some suggest that he's absent

[Bridge]
Destruction is a habit, insatiable apetite
Can't see it how I see it, they only see black and white

[Verse 2: Tron]
Whenever I contemplate late nights
Thoughts flowing like condensate drain pipes
Concentrate day lights
Across a pattern of glass shards
?scatter a wreckage a deck of cards?
My reflection don't play right
Stack the checkers and check backstories
Of facts of what they seem
Cause you lack more informative means
Act serious, carved into wax
We write letters of light and end them with dark periods

[Verse 3: Kon Sci}
Yo it's hard to understand the dark dwellings of the heavens
So we capture afterlife, demand an answer to the questions
Of eternity- the source of a lifespan
Indelible daydream, the course of my flight plans
A glance at the ides even evaluate the sinister God
Seein it forthright, comparable, clairvoyance to mortals
Who talk fight, disposable chalk lines
Fatalities stares cold
Into the abyss of any man's soul

[Hook 2]
Devil's asking price - yet to be satisfied
Soul still intact, yet to be sacrificed
Ain't been living lavish but actually gratified
Hungry as a haitian with holes in my bag of rice
Destruction is a habit, insatiable apetite
How full is the glass, as it passes your sight
Can't see it how I see it, they only see black and white
While my grey matter splices all these fragments of light
Gone[Verse 1 - Open Mike Eagle]

I need it sunny, pull the shades away
Lookin' at the sky like today's the day
I ate my breakfast like a king
My homies gon' be hungry, I won't feel a thing
Clothes ironed but it's weird
My family know I only iron once a year, yeah
I got a special treat, nestle crunch probably
Jacket members only, like my lunch posse
My wallet bulge on twenty five bucks
I coming home with that envelope from Lifetouch, yeah
Daaaaaaaaang

[Hook]

And I know they better not misspell my name homie
My momma probably thinkin' what the frame gon' be
My daddy better put me on his wall

[Bridge]

Natasha, it's picture day
Antonio, it's picture day
Eugene, it's picture day
Hey Brian, it's picture day

[Verse 2]

Yeah, a couple homegirls cheesed they little faces off
They happy cause they finally got they braces off
Gotta get a fresh fade, cut the beady beads
I heard they put your whole face on a DVD
My teacher, she a old freak wearing leopard print
Keepin' everybody breath right slangin' peppermints

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

It's my classes turn, we walkin' single file
Photo lady flirtin' with me cause she need a smile
Yeah, she thinks she's a pal of mine
What she don't know is that she gon' be my valentine
Yeah, stop in the hall, check my corduroys
They playin' Whitney Houston for the boys
My crew got them tough jackets
We 'bout to ante up, get that deluxe package
Look what I did with all my Christmas cash
Tryna pull a shorty from my older sister's class
Daaaaaaaaang

[Hook]

[Busdriver]

I'm in the corner where the dorks mope
Shouting answers gimme sore throats, pocket protecters and my sports coat
But it's picture day, so we tuck inhalers
Alphabetical order with gang bangers and chuck taylors
Yeah, but they don't know that we some surly tykes
Plotting all the worldly plights
Peep the hint of mischief as we grint all of our pearly whites
You won't roll the furry dice
But I bet your girly might
Oh, she's so sprung
And ya'll look so dumb and ho hum like ya'll some playful pheasants
I'm wavy in yearbooks like I need naval presence
Dressing like we play periodic table tennis
Handing you wallet sized pics, girl
They so precious

[Hook]

Hey Reagan, it's picture day
Hey James, it's picture day
Hey Rory, it's picture day
Hey Eric, it's picture day
Yeah[Intro]
Rappers belong to things
They got affiliations and shit and I do too
But fuck gangbanging, yeah

[Verse 1: Open Mike Eagle]
Life's kind of sucky bro
If you hearing this consider yourself lucky, though
Sharks in the boardroom program for guppies
Baby cuddle bunny in the box full of puppies, sho
No perm, grow a 'fro like Pam Grier
Don't say 'bro' bruh say manssiere, yeah
Any karaoke fans here?
If so, never get drunk and do Kashmir
It's not a good choice and white rappers quit
Rapping in your hood voice, sound like a clown
Hundred pounder that took 'roids
Don't do videos for tracks with your back to the cameraman
Phones get the family packing big data plan
'99 Problems' was a damn good summer song
If you got more than like three then something's wrong

[Chorus: Open Mike Eagle]
You're drowning in quicksand
You're flailing in the water
You're hands are waving all frantic
You'll die within the hour
Unless you do what we tell you to do
Me and my whole fam we Doug Stamper
(Yeah, yeah, and here's the -)
So you should do what we tell you to do
(Mmmhhh-ahhh - timing, shit!)
I say, good God damn we Doug Stamper

[Verse 2: Open Mike Eagle]
Yeah, and here's the bush I would never beat around
Never march through Korea Town in a Madea gown
Yeah, you know, like a Muumuu
And never buy used from that dude Joe Isuzu
If you find yourself down in Southern Illinois
Cop a mixtape from DJ Snowy Boo-boo, (that's a real dude?) yeah
And don't start them arguments
Or show flowcharts to an art-numb Parliament
And stand guard by your dart gun armament
And memorize your parts like a sharp-tongued artisan
Always tell a lie to C.I.A. torturers
Never buy weed from a guy named Mortimer
Buy bank forfeitures and foreclosures
If you start to lose your hair skip the comb-over
When you home open a game with the Orioles
A journalist should never write a slang editorial

[Chorus]
You're drowning in quicksand
You're flailing in the water
You're hands are waving all frantic
You'll die within the hour
Unless you do what we tell you to do
Me and my whole fam we Doug Stamper
So you should do what we tell you to do
I say, good God damn we Doug Stamper

[Verse 3: Hannibal Buress]
You a grown man do what I told you to
Stop pissing on the motherfucking toilet stool (disgusting)
Wash your hands when you touch your little dirty dick
And dry 'em off before you come trying to shake my shit (get outta here)
You a ho if your Facebook is complicated
Eat your fruit fiber bitch or get constipated (grrr)
No finger waves, except baby face
LeBron James needs to stop taking HGH
His hairline fucked up from the HGH
Went from one headband to like, eighty-eight
You ain't a thug, stop acting like you've been through shit
Stop paying for them porn site memberships  (that shit's a waste)
Go to YouPorn nigga, that shit is free
But don't bootleg my comedy, pay the fee (buy it)
Tell your cousin, stay the fuck from off of Worldstar
And don't buy a Honda Civic, that's a girl's car
And don't buy a Chevy Aveo, or a Mini Cooper or Yaris
And don't, don't set stuff on fire either

Actually, if... If you can only afford one of those cars, cause those are compact cars and are very affordable, then get that, don't let me judge your life, but that other stuff, I mean that other stuff

Yeah[Intro: Busdriver]
We leap through your T.V., bruh
My dudes sick like we looped leukemia
The beat sick like we looped leukemia
My scene sick like we looped leukemia
Alert the news media x2

[Hook: Nocando]
This that dorner (too soon)
That new town (too soon)
That bath salt, that moon rock, that god damn it that's (too soon) x2

[Verse 1: Open Mike Eagle]
Mike Eagle will not fail, Mike Eagle will not fail
I repeat shit to myself more than these white people in Scottsdale
I'm a indie hustler first team
Fuck music, sell shirt screens
And I pull up to my rap show in a Ford Focus, on 13s
And my nephews in the eighth grade
He only talks about bayblade
And my supermarket is ralphs
On tour I'm looking for Safeway
I'm a cantankerous old coot
A man, a blanket no phone booth
And this never bitten [?] all or nothing
This ass naked as snow suit

[Hook]

[Verse 2: VerBS]
Squad is always full of haters
Me and flocka puff trees like Bob Marley and the whalers
Thick white girls, they must of came from the cater
I got the ill vibe I got the bay area flavor
That's how I open up all these hot bars
I'm out of this world nigga
Yeah I'm something like I'm a Mark Clark, ooh
I started rapping off the walls of Crenshaw
Back in the day I call that, yo
The burn parkour
Picked up the times, I blow niggas ran mouths
Any darlin' pardon my grand smile
On this marathon jog, I'm going to stand out
Opportunities open up, it's a plus if you dope as fuck and you rhyme like...

[Hook]

[Interlude]
Too soon...  too soon...

[Verse 3: Nocando]
Yuh
Icarus, niggerish
Genesis, Leviticus
Candy flipin' the Lawrence Fishburne crimson with that clear pill Limitless
In Bristol sipping Gunisses
Hard to handle like life with a wife and ten kids and six different mistresses (Woo!)
This shit is getting ridiculous
Niggas are getting so sensitive
Forgive me for my insolence
I ain't really into this
I got a new view through a new scope
I'ma be frank like the new pope
I don't give a fuck if them dudes dope
It's Hellfyre, eat a dick eat a dick till you dudes choke

[Verse 4: KAIL]
My neighbors are pigs, so we don't speak when we I grab the mail
My neighbors are pigs, so if my crowbar snaps a tail
I'm fast as hell, there ain't no catching KAIL
But, catch me if you can Frank Abagnale, pass the snail
But, we just gon' discount that as rails
Until they're on my traffic trail and know how this package smell
Long as you packin' cells, I pack the nail from the coffin that sends your rat ass back to hell
Bitch!

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Busdriver]
Yeah
Niggas say my catalogue's to YMCA
Not enough YMCMB, and life plant reek of fresh brie
Yuh (Oh shoot!)
Like I'm a white man on a ten speed
Like I'm in Thailand, never rent free
All I ever need the mic stand, that's what the rats see
My socio never overshare
Look the hood calling me weird cuz my shit could weaponize the open air
Yelp alerts could be heard in ear buds
Believe in this [?] road flares
This shit is barely a beer buzz
You could never stand with us, like a leery jugs
Or apply there and buy share
I'm like hi there and I'ma buy this Paris
On the pulmonary palimpsest
Feedin' niggas in high chairs with an Allen wrench
No fashion sense from a [?] DuPont, big dog man call me Marmaduke
Might think tanks more than the [?] crew
Make the uninitiated barf and puke
We beside the finest from some smashed atoms
While ratchet hoes do tableaus till they suffer from back spasms
We climb backstage like Patch Adams
Took the game with us like backgammon
Press pass and test labs as my best gags it sounds like crash landings

[Verse 6: Rheteric Ramirez]
And they knew I was crazy without getting drunk and you thinking I'm tipsy
I kept it one hundred, I've never been fifty percent or fifty one fifty
The shit I see on the new Do' got me feeling chaotic neutral
Put yourself in my shoes though
What you think Tookie and Dorner would do bro?
Better check that [?]
I got some gangster shit that'll make you grey matter into a fuckin' hankerchief
Cause this is operation Repo
To take L.A. back from people
That wanna make dark skin friends without crossing Pico
If I force you to take the bus to places you're scared to drive to
Would reality coincide with what you buy on iTunes?
They say we rose from the ashes after riots, but I wouldn't believe it
Shaking that is like burning the wing of a dove, and calling that shit a phoenix
The cost of living that empty coffin, cause death is an empty wallet
This isn't the petty problems, of bitches and Mary Poppins
Whenever the [?] calls it
Give a fuck if my enemies talkin'
Destiny though will never be broke fasho that's been My War like Henry Rollins

[Outro: Busdriver]
Too soon... Too soon... [Repeated][Verse 1]
Started life as a Christian
I was enticed by religion
To spark a spiritual life that was missing
As an acolyte
A white Jesus had me actin' right
Chasing the thoughts of an after life
So I attended service like clockwork
Sunday's best
And socks from the top drawer
But Jesus wasn't the reason for my Oxfords
I mostly went for this girl I had the hots for

[Verse 2]
Whenever I was kinda bored
Thoughts of the girl I adored ignite a war
Haunted by the angry white Jesus by the door
Natural impulses I strive to ignore
I was divided to the core
The age-old battle
Between human anatomy vs. science of the Lord
I came real close to leaving my burdens by the door
Until I asked the preacher man about the dinosaurs

[Hook: Jefferson DeJesus]
It seems if we lie
Will we lay there beside it?
They say that it's right
But it doesn't seem righteous

[Verse 3: Serengeti]
She didn't really wanna get Botox really
She rather vowed against it
But opportunity arose
It would increase her chances to get this gig
Her manager said
"I'm not saying anything
But we could really use it right now
Besides what's the big deal?
Everybody does it
We need the work
And as I face it
Everybody hires once
We gotta play the game
We're married to a different fuckin' custom
A pioneer of something new?
That's a lotta work to do
I personally I don't think that you got it in you
To champion a new cause
You look really good in draws
Sometimes you gotta follow fuckin' laws and shit"

[Bridge: Jefferson DeJesus]
They rival the stars
And they all fight with lightning
We sit by the fire
And conspire here in silence

[Hook]Yo, rap a little, Driver, go for it!
Busdriver:
Make a hole and behold my whole mind
For the black holes, holy wars to hole nine
A whole body who goes stale with all the old biscuits
For growth sales hold the mail cause I'm holistic
My smalltalk is a folktale of old mystics
Its dollar value is a smoke trail of old Plymouths
I found footing on the coattails of show business
For this airy hole's a hotel with ghosts in it
I ensured the expulsion of astral goo
And caused convulsions as addictive as tobacco chew
My lips are the volcano's rare mica
Blink at the sky and have a rainbow dimmed by
Sharing the notion I pinch a shaft of light
From every hole I'm a messy troll who spat on tykes
Your every hole is lined with the gold bands
And you must be a coke can and I must be a whole man
The b-burial plot is where you all grow corn
I'm a dust mite whose blood type is lowborn
But now my lips from which sherry o sworn(?)
And my personal warmth is set to snowstorm!
But now my lips from which sherry o sworn(?)
And my personal warmth is set to snowstorm!

Open Mike Eagle:
I heard Kendrick Lamar's batman and Miley Cyrus
Likes to treat her microphone stand as if it's a large black man
They feed Tyson chickens liquid Viagara
Unemployed college grads would gentrify Africa
Hold up, there's breaking news about Lamar Odom
Coming through my 24 hundred barred modem
Thank you for letting me be myself again
Not European; I don't dig shows about elfin men
Revenge of the nerd rap tournaments; join us
As we drink on cheap beer and have to belch to win
Icecaps will melt your friends and my friends
Even the ones that eat raw food and do thigh bends
Might as well sucker punch Mike Tyson
Be a hood Heisenberg rollin' blunts full of Ricin
In Islamabad humming Hava Nagila
On a loudspeaker, quoting from Bhagavad Gitas
Rappers calling out names for other rappers to focus on
It's like an episode of Pokemon; Big Sean, I choose you!
I got a message for a lot of folks
You got two twitter accounts? Nigga I won't follow both
Nigga I won't follow both

Jeremiah Jae:
Set fire to the bandstand with propane
Let my spirit rise come and ride on the soul train
This is so flame, wash it with a cold drink
In a fishbowl find remnants of your whole team
Yeah, stimulated by the cold dreams
Black streets where they pack heat and hold beef
Throw c's off the boat, make these hoes scream
Always knew I could be a product of the dope G
If I didn't know the history I wouldn't repeat it
Like the Jam of the Week rap about big tires
On my nose G, you rap like a minor
Chilling by your 'rents bed with the night light on
Terrified by the dark, I'm a black hole
And a lightbulb and an elephant in the pressroom
You a yang, no yin in the cesspool
Etched in the memory of teenage girls who
Act tribal, monkey see, monkey do
Off that white dust on that white bus to the zoo
No visitor, more like a resident
Welcome to the show, you have been selected
To fill that Hellfyre, Hellfyre black jungle all you rappers just plummet
