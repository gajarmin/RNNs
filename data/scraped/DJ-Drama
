[Intro: DJ Drama]
You see I been waiting, waiting on that time
Feel me if you been waiting on yours
That moment... is close (Yeah!)

[Jeremih]
Tired of living day to day like everything is alright...
Just waiting on that moment
Waiting on my moment

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Yeah, 2 Chainz!
Old dude met mom it was on
Then he named me over a phone, prison term
Live and learn, sippin' syrup with my vision blurred
Take this cup of reality, niggas finna err
When you start from the bottom you can see the top
So when you get to it, don't let 'em see the spot
Next thing you know you lookin' for a rent sign
Upper echelon, bitch we skip line
I remember reminiscing in the kitchen like
I wonder when the Braves gon' win it
I wonder when the Falcons gon' get here; pyrex vison
Made more than I ever made with DTP this year

[Hook: Jeremih]
Tired of livin' day to day like everything is alright
Livin like there's one thing on my mind
Just waiting on that moment
Waiting on my moment
You say you got that oh shit? Hell nah - next time that's mine
Long as I stay hustling I'm gon' shine
Just waiting on that moment
Waiting on my moment

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Waitin' on my moment...
Just waiting on my moment; bad hoes I'm shonin
Time came and I owned it just like Lebron James and start ballin
When I touch the block I cracked the block, when I pulled up in that muscle drop
With that roof off and my shoes off on you bitch niggas, RuPaul
Real nigga in my hood, who everybody gon' root for
Cause they see my come from that bottom where everybody get bodied
They told me get em, I got em, now I'm here nigga like yeah nigga
Just Rolls Royce and Bugattis and M4's this year nigga
If I don't grind, I don't shine, if I don't shine, then I don't eat
Won't eat, then I'mma starve, if I'mma starve, I pull heat
On all y'all bitch ass niggas, all y'all rich ass niggas
Cause if I dont make no money nigga, I'm gon' take yo money nigga

[Hook]

[Bridge: Jeremih]
Since life ain't promised tomorrow
Live it up! Live it up! Live it up!
Here before it come this far
Give it up! Give it up! Give it up!
I won't - Give it up! Give it up! Give it up!
Until I have it all, yeah!

[Hook]

[Outro: DJ Drama]
DJ Drama!
Y'all like that? We gone[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
Lot of grievances and wish tales on the wrong niggas
K's sound like grey hounds, they long winded
Week start, high school sweetheart, what's wrong with him?
Black snake moan, tre-eight long as bone tissue
Lay on side my son and he's like ''Daddy, what's wrong?''
Few elusive habits, won't consider marriage I'm gone
I've been shot, I've been stabbed, had like cheap liquor
Slipped then got back on my feet like C. Billups
I done lost my money gambling, loudmouth rambling
Did a lot of lying 'til my women couldn't stand it
Nigga killed my brother so I took him from his family
Went and got some tears in my face, now I'm branded
All I ever wanted was some money like Sandy
Louise Vuitton shades for my dame, life fancy
Sweet face then I lick her pussy like nasty
But I ain't like her boyfriend if you was just asking

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
Wait, who is this?
Ayo, wait, I don't know
I'm doing this XXL shit, I can't really talk on the phone right now

Smack called me, I was getting some head
He said ''come do this XXL cover instead''
I said ''for sure, bust a bitch on the bed
Bust a nut on her head, tell me when and where and it's dead''
In the moment feels like a rush don't it?
Me hopping on the plane to fly to New York with no advance
From my non-existent label to spend
Money I'm spent, funded my tour in Europe
Paid it for myself
When a bunch of nigga's labels probably paid for the spot
I don't know, maybe not, could've been genuine
I laugh at Mr.Rogers in the hood
Told him why these niggas is brokeboys, they need reassembling
I'm Wimbledon, used to be innanet, now I'm a free man like Morgan
Free agent, three agents, the A&R man and a midget on my foreskin
Hey, Kobe, tell me how my ass taste
They should save my shit for the outtakes
I might take everyone out, flee the scene with the murder weapon
And a dick in your mouth, feet on your couch and my middle finger's up With my fucking Timb spot cause I don't give a fuck

[Hook: August Alsina]
Be on my grind and my hustle all day
Baby, I'mma shine, keep it bright always
And I be on the grind on the block all day
I'mma hustle all day, I'mma hustle all day
You know I'mma grind, I'mma hustle all day
And baby I'mma shine like a light always
You know I'mma grind, I'mma hustle all day
I'mma hustle all day, I'mma hustle all day, yeah

[Verse 3: Isaiah Rashad]
Look, I'm on this XXL getting this paper
What I told her, she was slick as a fox
Sweet as the cadence, tell me, baby, you gon' love me or not?
With my dick in her mouth
I'm just chilling, my eyes glued to the ceiling
Just imagine getting closer to God
My uncle tried to stand on money then grab on something
Then have no knots and have no nothings and can't afford that
Swerving, just left service with Aunt Berlin
The Drama got her busy, this tenant is cart serving
Serving a junkie, maybe his family or something
That said that math just be exquisite when we pimping them bitches
Don't twist a cabinet in the kitchen unless you working them riches
Hold up, but we continue, we ain't washing no dishes
Laughing niggas laughing to the cashier
I don't really give a fuck
Getting to acting baffled, should not crash ya
Told you you'd get it, nigga

[Verse 4: Chance The Rapper]
Young black boy, how he got the labels scared?
A&R's be like "Chano, you ain't playin fair"
You gon' set a bad example for the average bear
You a yogi, you should idle while in child's position
I be like, naw, these my sons, this prenatal care
I'mma show 'em how to make it here and make it fair
Take it there they could kill me and I ain't gon' care
You is just an ankle weight, lighter than some angel cake
Sweeter than some maple syrup, easier than ableton
Make a plate and make it player, make 'em play it
Just don't count your sheep before they hatch
You chickens ‘fore your eggs or eat 'fore you say your prayer

[Hook][Intro]
I shouldn’t have out the shades on
Keep all that too
Jefe!

Yours Truly
Versace Shades
I feel like Biggie in This Bitch
Thank You!

[Chrous]
Come on and let a real nigga sing to you
Stop letting all these rappers prank you
I like to sip purp, I smoke dank too
Running out the jungle, I’m a bengal
Thank you, thank you, thank you, Thank you, Thank you (x3)
For listening to a real nigga

[Verse 1]
I never in my whole life felt this much pain
Riding through your ghetto trying to bust your nigga’s brain
Meek just hit my phone and said he bought a glitzy chain
He told me lil bruh I know you about to kill the game
Guess what, I just got a fuckin call from mack maine
He told me Birdman want me to be in Rich Gang
My OG don’t do shit he just like bricks and champagne
And you won’t see his face if you don’t get a whole thing
Talk to to ?? everyday, he don’t ask the kid for shit
Cuz got 60 niggas crying over 6
Don’t look at my IG and be like shawty he the lick
Run up you’ll get hit, whole lotta guns, I don’t know the name of this shit

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I just bought a dog and named him 40
You know I keep that dog , this a 40
Check your shorty, she out here having orgy’s
And ya’ll love shorty, all y’all going to see Maury
These niggas hate me cuz I got my bands up
I’m gonna keep going til my niggas in a mansion
Bitch from france she say bon jour you’re so handsome
Fancy restaurants what me to pull my pants up
I just seen my jeweler a couple days ago
They hate me when I do that lazy flow
You say you love how? That ain’t your lady tho
Sold a quarter, spent a quarter on a bracelet tho

[Chorus][Produced by DJ Drama]

[Hook: Young Thug]
Young nigga got it jumpin' like Jordan
200 on the foreign, I'ma get it right back
Bought Versace from Versace
Just to be flashy, I'ma get it right back
Fought a case for the boy
Bitch I got a lawyer, I'ma get it right back
I'm whippin' my wrist to put Rollie on wrist
I'ma get it right back

[Verse 1: Jeezy]

I'ma get it right back
You ain't gotta ask, know a nigga got up on his waist
Rat-a-tat-tat-tat
Ain't nothin' but some big boy shit goin' on
That's right, when you see me, nigga
All of this presidential shit that a nigga ridin' in
Might as well move to DC, nigga
I'll hit Lenox Mall up right now
Cash out, everything they got in that bitch
Soon as I'm walkin' out the door, nigga leavin' out the store
They gon' be like God dammit he rich
Guess what? Think I seen Jizzle in the valet
Walkin' 'round with about a hundred bags
2014 in the valet and you know it still got the paper tags
Big black mothafucka with a stripe down the middle
Yeah I call it the silverback
Bitch starin' at the stars on my roof
Same time, keep askin', "Where the ceilin' at?"
Don't get my shit, trying to interrogate me, girl
I don't know you like that
That ain't how it go down, I'll turn this bitch 'round
And I'll take your ass right back

[Hook: Young Thug]

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
I'ma get it right back
Lose it, in a week bet I get it right back
Tried to play hard, fucked her on the first week
Bet she comin' right back
Throw it from the back, know you like it like that
If you don't, you lyin', bitch who you think you playin'?
Walked in this mothafuckin' bitch, I'm the man
Louis V earmuffs, can't hear what you're sayin'
Thugger my brother, yeah Jeezy my fam
And it don't mean I'm cussin' if I say the word, "dam"
Cause I'm talkin' 'bout a river
Diamonds shinin' like a mothafuckin' nickel
Feet up, yeah I'm reclinin' on niggas
Pistol out, window down, ridin' on niggas
I'ma get it right back, like I never lost it
Shawty came right back
Had her mouth open like the sign on Lacoste
I told her, "Don't be disrespectful, baby girl don't talk back
Cause it'll cost you"
In the end I say, "Fuck the Lexus, I'ma drive the Benz today"
Thugger, Thugger tell 'em

[Hook: Young Thug][Intro: DJ Drama]

[Verse 1: Cassper Nyovest]
I'm from the parts where uhm
Hao sa qave o ska tshela
Bietjie maak meer
Ha go nyewa ra function-a
We kinda confused
Cause we wanna be safe in the streets
But we mocking the cops and
We look up to drug dealers
Nobody can fuck with us
We don't give a fuck
Phela when we in the 'burbs
Mommy wanna rock with us, (Ba re)
A re o tlala ka lepantsula
A re o tlala ka lepantsula
Ba apola, ba kgowa
Ba gona, ba apola
I would've said the weakest
And she'd still rock with us (regardless)
A re o qwala ka lekgomsha
A re o qwala ka lekgomsha
She said she want something different
For instance, sex game hella consistent
And the wrist stay glistening
Man I got game like the 6 man (abashwe, abashwe, abashwe)

[Chorus: Anatii]

[Verse 2: Cassper Nyovest]
Yeah, she's used to the rich
Her whole life was bliss
After I took her to the hood
She couldn't resist
She said all the people are real
My kasi consists of
All these other elements
Her daddy wouldn't permit
She found a new meaning to life
She said it's a like song
She's been meaning to write
A re o tlala ka lepantsula, (A re o tlala)
A re o tlala ka lepantsula
Wa tlala, ra saka, ra lakha, ra fasa
I kinda think she real though
Bougie but she still dope
I mean, she like Gucci and all
But if you give it a chance
We could truly evolve
Into something they never saw
So bona, go fela so?
Even though we fought
The love was never lost
I mean you travelled the world
I see you hella bored
Holler at your boy, ha re jaive
Re itumele so

[Chorus: Anatii]

I Know alot of niggas out her broke who will do anything for that paper

And I'm like what would you do for some paper?
Back then nigga I'll do anything for some paper, that's straight up

10 milli yo, sponsored by CMG
Mac a write a book about who owe me
Pussy ass niggas gone D.I.E., on sight, A.S.A.P
Nigga say he gonna snatch my chain
Nigga better know my name
Suicide man the boy insane
He lost his mind that nigga lost his point
If I'm beefing with a nigga I'll fuck his baby momma
Get all in her head and tell that bitch that I love her
Send a pack to my partner
Send a demo to a cousin
Ooh I got his ass in the oven
I just seen this money turn a pretty bitch ugly
Time made a nigga turn state on his cousin
Bitch broke up the whole squad for the pussy
Never be us, swear to god, or we pussy
I fuck with Snootie Wild the strong way
All I know is yayo like the song say
Money dont fold, its the long way
Slow grand, took the long way
My niggas my niggas forever
Enemies, enemies forever
Bitch you whatever
Like Meek said there's levels
And choppers are devils
Got extended on .40 Glocks, I love my Beretta
I might just be a gun fanatic cause my ego a devil

[Chorus: Yo Gotti]
I've been selling crack since I was 12
Still trying to duck 12 (yep)
Old school Chevy for twelves
And two grams short no scales
Nigga that 12
I don't hit the club before 12
I never fuck with no 12
My bitch is on 12
And my status so hot
I ain't trying to fuck nothing else, yup!

[Verse 2: Snootie Wild]
All a nigga move is bells
And I move them in dark after 12
Four years locked in a cell and they let me out, nigga, 'round 12
GD is what a nigga bank and it's nothing but love screaming 12
Fuck with a mothafucking client
I'll send your whole crew straight to hell
Nigga hit a lick for like 12 blocks
Caught a motherfucker slipping by the mailbox
My young nigga got hit with like six shots
That's why a nigga walk around here shellshocked
I don't hit the club 'til 12
12 o'clock on my rollie
Nigga might work for the 12
Motherfucker don't know me
Partner called me out for a bitch, so a nigga had to bail
Big brother Gotti told me, don't trust shit in this world
12!

[Chorus x2: Yo Gotti][Intro: DJ Drama]

Wife beaters and jeans, and a pair of Jordans on these niggas
Head cocked to the back, and I smash the sport on these niggas
You get money then show it, if you ain't then stop lying
If you looking for a nigga, bitch I ain't hard to find
Only nigga in the city, million dollars a car
How you kick it with the goon, you meant to be with the star

Pouring up that Bombay, let that reefer burn
Getting gobbled by your bitch, my nigga wait your turn

[Hook]

[Interlude]
Stacks so fat rubber bands can't hold
Stacks so fat rubber bands can't hold
Stacks so fat rubber bands can't hold it, no
They can't hold it, no, they can't hold it, no

[Yung Joc]
Eeenie, meenie, miny, moe

See I'm lookin' for the baddest bitch
Splurge for a second when I'm done you can have this bitch

[Willie The Kid]
5000, 10,000, 20 - ones in my hand, that's good money
Ones in my fan, we get money, she pop that thang, she get that
That money's fallin' like rain, I'm VIP that's champagne
I'm K-I-D do my thang, and yes, indeed, I got change
Or shall I say I got paper, stacked money tall as skyscrapers
Hater's you fly I fly paper, she pop that thang she get that
She make it hot like wasabi, look at that body on mommy
She probably stand right beside me, and I tsunami lil' mommy

[Hook]

[Young Jeezy]
They call me Young, my money long

Now loose your bottoms, now loose your tops
You saw what I just spent, I could've bought a watch
I could've bought a car, maybe a couple bricks
I send my hood bitch the fifths on a shoppin' trip
5000 ones, ya you know young wit it
So high up in the air, she need a flight to go get it
Still Mr. Magic City, you know no replacements
This is what I do I got a pole in my basement
If I can make it to Onyx, I bring Onyx to the condo
Call lil' bro bring me 20 grand pronto

[Hook] + [Interlude]

[Twista]
It's the Twista and can't nobody hold him

Get love in the strip club
Gotta nigga feeling so freaky they askin' is you roamin'
Yeah, makin' it rain is automatic when
She's askin if you trickin' you got it
Pimpin' is a habit from Twista Magic City
And the muthafuckin' betta bet not bitch about it
Steady stackin' paper that's the reason we be throwin' it up
Dollas at the coke, they slang D
Really lil' momma all over DJ Drama
And T.I., Joc, and Nelly when we in da club
I'mma pop a couple of bottles
And I'mma start that good shit up
Got 5000 ones and I'm about to throw it up
Sip on some that Patron

Gotta cup a lil' somethin' cause I pay the bill
Still money ain't shit, I make major deal
Better ring the alarm, here come the paper
Twista comin' in the club when I get I pop a lot
When she come up wit a fatty I gladly tip her
Jazze, tell 'em what I got

[Hook] + [Interlude][Intro: DJ Drama (Sage The Gemini)]
Hey Sage
(I would say I'm back but I never left)
I want you to talk that shit!

[Verse: Sage The Gemini]
Fuck your bullshit it really don't amaze me (Bay God!)
I'm on many niggas list trying to erase me
Tell a bitch nigga if them keys paid
You can be an automation clip it still won't faze me
I'm living girl, money fatter than Cartman
Talking shit from a distance like I don't know marksmen
Doing shit [?] like I'm social with corks and I'm really varsity
Rookie and [?] they like "How [?] ya'll got your [?]"
Ya'll the starting team
I was a ghost like [?]
Doing twerk songs bringing out hoes like that nigga Santa
Hating niggas man I can't stand them
So I pump fear and make them hold their chest like the national anthem
See ya'll done brought the Bay Area out
My niggas come from 2 ways like stereo out
Hop off a [?] black match
Carry them out
And Ooh Kill Em' like Terio account
It's real nigga
707 not 007
If you shut the fuck up it might save your ass from heaven
You ain't suffer, niggas don't understand me
[?] but only 2 pieces of cheese can feed the whole family
Yeah, nigga
They say don't forget where you came from or [?] doing stick ups
Fixing, some of these niggas be bitches
Hang a fruit by the foot and beat his ass till' he 6 inches
But, that ain't a gay joke
What's really funny is niggas think whips and chains they really Django
And I'mma shine on this music that's what it's made for
And I hope it's worth every dollar the people paid for
It's me

[Outro: DJ Drama]
You know that's just like a warm up type of thing
I don't want you to get mad
Sage is rich, Drama's rich
Hahahhahah! I'm sorry man[T.I. talking]
Live and direct from the traps of the A-town, nigga
West side, Bankhead, nigga
Pimp Squad Clique, nigga
Grand Hustle, pimp
Say I'm mad, huh?
Your faggot ass gon' be mad in a minute (Sissy ass nigga)
(Hey, let's go, nigga) I'mma hit your faggot ass in the mouth when I see ya, nigga
Fuck what you heard, homie, leprechaun ass nigga

King of the place called home of the bass
He emerged at the trap, from the zone of the flake
Caught a case, and he still keep a chrome on his waist
For the haters in the face gettin' thrown in the way
Like a pussy nigga named Lil' Wesley, tryna test me
On your best behavior what your faggot ass best be
Choose words carefully when you address me
You ain't gotta like me, but you're gonna respect me
(Or else) or else you get wet like a jet ski
Take ten of these and live, that'll impress me
Say I wanna rap on your songs but you ain't let me
See you on the front of The Source, like that upset me
Fuck you in the ass, I ain't mad 'bout shit
Try Tip, shot quick, that's all your ass gon' get
And I ain't finna put a mask on, Flip
I'mma empty out the clip and your ass gon' flip
Bet your mom and your dad gon' trip
But them the consequences try to mash on Tip
Nigga, lyrically I'll murk you
Physically I'll hurt you
You ain't never ran the streets, you had a curfew
Pussy nigga playing with me, you'll be in the dirt soon
Look you in the eye see you sweet like perfume (muah)
So go on, keep running you dick suckers
I'mma swing, show the world that you just a big sucker
Daddy shoulda got some head, bet he wish he woulda worn rubber
But he didn't, so now I guess the world gotta suffer
You the kind of wanksta, gangsta's done had enough of
So I'mma take pride when I ride through and bust you
Tip will be the reason for the saddest day your momma seen
When I let this K slay a nigga like the Drama King

Better find a nigga to try, nigga I ain't the one
I got 99 problems, Lil Flip ain't one (ha, hey, hey)
I got 99 problems, Lil Flip ain't one
This pussy nigga wanna beef well he find him some
I got 99 problems, Lil Flip ain't one (ha, hey, hey)

Fuck, boy you wanted beef, well you found you some

[Lil Flip]
Scarface the king of the South

[T.I.]
Pussy nigga, shut the fuck up
I'm cool with Face and even he know that you're a sucker
Paul Wall runnin' Texas along with Slim Thug
Mike Jones, ESG, and Z-Ro some real hustlers
Never been a Botany Boy, you just a buster
Never been seen outside on the Southside
Sucka nigga puttin' on like you run shit
After Third go to jail with this leprechaun shit
Half the time you don't like what I'm saying then buck
Nigga, swing when you see me, nigga, I don't give a fuck!
Cause I know you just a lame and your partners ain't tough
Know your aim ain't shit and know your fight game suck
So I couldn't image you what G's would wanna listen to
Just some kids, women, and a lot of homosexuals
I'm a stand up guy man I'm into principle
All you do is lie, and everything you say is fictional
I demand my respect, I'll die about that
But I'mma hit you with the tek, and let you lie about that
So keep me out your raps or this shit ain't done

I got 99 Problems, Lil Flip ain't one (come on)
I say, 99 problems, Lil Flip ain't one
Pussy nigga wanted beef well he found him some
I got 99 probelms, Lil Flip ain't one

[T.I. talking]

[Lil Flip]
And I'll adore you, I'll treat you like milk
I'll do nothing but spoil you[Intro: Future]
Ain't no way around it
Ain't no way around it
Ain't no way around it
Ain't no way around it
Ain't no way around it
Ain't no way around it

[Hook: Future]
A bitch gon' be a bitch
A ho gon' be a ho
A killer gon' be a killer
That's somethin' you need to know
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it
A dealer gon' be a dealer
A plug gon' be a plug
My niggas, them my niggas, they just like blood
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it

[Verse 1: Future]
I had a young, hot thang fucked my bro and gave 'em brain
And she expect for me to love her, I can never be a lame
I'm attracted to her sexually, but she ain't my main dame
We can be the best of friends, shawty, but you off the chain
See I ain't gonna' hold it against ya
I'ma keep it pimpin' with ya
Don't you come at me with issues
Ain't tryna get all in your mixture
I ain't tryna come to get ya
You can meet me somewhere on Peachtree
At the W on the Fourteenth
Ain't tryna fuck no ho tryna know me
And they wanna fuck my woodie, already smashed the homie
Half of these bitches phony, singin' love songs like Toni
Ms. Braxton you the action, stop actin'
Just another sad love song waitin' to happen

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Strapped with that flame and he ready to bust a brain
You can't tell the homie nothing, he done felt too much pain
He don't care nuttin' 'bout no fame
He addicted to the game
Some niggas rob, some niggas slang
Do whatever to maintain
Travel all the way to Waco
Get them numbers for the low-low
Bigger the risk, the bigger the check
We watch for po-po
Make sure you keep your eyes on
When you're drivin' down 1-0
That interstate ain't no joke when you're ridin' with Coco
When you got hands like these
You can count money with your eyes closed
When you spend cheese like this
You send killers to niggas front door
Half of these niggas front fo', bitches for extra convo
Really plugged in with migo, go blind and still get c-notes

[Hook][Intro: Future]
Ain't no way around it [x6]

[Hook: Future]
A bitch gon' be a bitch, a ho gon' be a ho
A killer gon' be a killer - that's something you need to know
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it
A dealer gon' be a dealer, a plug gon' be a plug
My niggas, them my niggas, we just like blood
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it

[Verse 1: Future]
I had a young, hot thang fucked my bro and gave 'em brain
And she expect for me to love her, I can never be a lame

See I ain't gonna hold it against ya, I'mma keep it pimping with ya
Don't you come at me with issues, ain't tryna get all in your mixture
I ain't tryna come to get ya, you can meet me somewhere on Peach street
At the W on the Fourteenth, ain't tryna fuck no ho tryna know me
And they wanna fuck my woodie, already smashed the homie
Half of these bitches phony, singing love songs like Toni
Ms. Braxton you the action, stop acting
Just another sad love song waiting to happen

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
A killer gonna' be a killer, that's regardless of the fact that I'm Tin Man heartless
No love for ya' baby unless you walkin' through my living room braless
With your nipples pokin' through ya wife beater, you the mic eater
She doing Daddy Fat Stacks soon as I meet her
Get it meet her, cut to the chase like a cheetah cause she want that Peta
Pipe her down, gon' wipe her clown when so many niggas un-wiped her down
You hopin' that she gon' turn her life around, about face, a full one-eighty
A ho into a housewife, that's your lady and me, I never give another but a dope baby
With a good time and a dope dick, she love the way I talk and my flow slick
Ain't no way around it
Yo-yo-yo-yo-your bitch in love with my dick
But big don't love her at all, let a monkey nigga pay the bills while I scrub them jaws
Like a test for DNA, TNA, we the A

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jeezy]
Ball so had I need ace of spades, livin' life through these ray bans
Drop four, whipped up eight man
How you do that, got great hands
I ain't seen you niggas like Ray Charles, figure I'll drive these eight car
Trynna' figure how I'ma fuck these eight hoes, same time increase my bank roll
Broke shit had my vision blurred, so I went and copped me a quarter bird
Got me a job got work to do, need a job nig got work for you
Hood lil' niggas die by respect, niggas bleeding what they readin' on the internet
Where ya' from? nigga where ya' plug?
Just like I thought, niggas silent thugs
That is a job fuck niggas hate, why you think I'm carrying this seven-eight
Twenty-two rounds that'll keep me straight, if I ain't got that then I make and bake
Been gettin' money since baby Nate, red monkey, I'mma watch junkie
Ain't no way really 'round that, made them young niggas screaming, "where the pounds at?"
What

[Hook][Intro: Meek Mill]
Man, fuck all these niggas

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I used to have bad luck
Now you might see me in the land truck
Whole clique, full of real niggas that'll stand up
When you see them hammers out
Nigga put yo hands up
Matter fact put yo hands down nigga man up
Take this headshot, hit yo homie that's a and1
Shoot 'em, that's for rockin' out with shooters down til the van come
Feds tapped my I-Phone
Metro, and my Samsung
Block numbers callin' me and I don't know if to answer
Coke money comin' in, Rap money comin' too
I just bought a mulsanne
Shitted on them , number 2
Homie that's your boo-thang, my niggas we be runnin through
We pass her round like hot potato, Melly hit I fuck her too
Hammer dat, AK wit' a 50 I banana dat
Lifes got it's up and downs sorta like a camel back
If it's beef, I don't say a word my niggas handle that
Put 50 on Miami it won't even turn the channel back
Woah nigga, Die slow nigga
You got booked with 10 birds and you home nigga
I think you told nigga, you get exposed nigga
I easy pass up in yo bitch you paid a toll nigga
I drop, back on that paper ain't got no racks for these haters
My niggas trap in the field, silver and black like the raiders
This hatin' shit like a virus, niggas be catchin' them vapors
I spend a mil on my crib, barely be catchin' my neighbors
Cause I don't never be there, Northside i'm heavily there
Prolly be up in the hills, wit a bitch named Beverly there
I had a dream I got murdered I think the devil was there
Then woke up fingers on triggers [?]

[Verse 2: Spade-O]
You think of me, you think of a problem
Who, what, where, and how the fuck yo family gone pay for yo coffin
Hey main man we way pass the friend stage
Nigga left engaged, I hit you in yo face with a ten gauge
I'm from where it is, Nigga you from where the cash was
I bust a nigga head, And make him show me where the cash was
After us there should be no more
If it was so much love it would be no war
If they all were good girls, There would be no whores
And how much fun would that be, They're all gunnin at me
And no false alarms, So when I call to arms
All my niggas get wound tight like big balls of yarn
It's on, Drastic timing, Drastic living
I mean I feel an itch, I make rash decisions
I'm a street mathematician, I blew from a 62
You wouldn't believe the type things that white shit will do
From acer with the gap in his teeth
Ace of spade half a mill worth of crap on the streets
Started rappin' on beats, and pushin' rhymes like weight
Homie go and get yours, I got mines I'm straight
Spent most of my teenage years on a crate
5 dollars at a time in pursuit of Bill Gates
Wait, I'm a nigga you gotta see tho
I'm sum'n like a mix between Debo and Tim Tebow
My steelo I bogard like Humphry
The rims on the Benz make that bitch look Comfy
Chump me, I dare a nigga try and pump me
The 4 pound a ground any niggas tryna jump me
Get goofy my trigger finger get loosey
Goosey shit I got blood on my gucci's
Oh well I go and get a new pair
This ain't the same ole shit
This is sum'n new here
Yeah it's no fear, Cause when I was serving time
They was rappin' bout sellin' bricks, and they were servin' dimes
It's fine, I move better in the dark
So when a nickel bag get sold in the park
Nigga I want in, 8's and 9's like I won him
But if them hoes ain't dimes shit I don't want them
I'm like a gem or like a diamond in the rough
The audemar is pristine no diamonds in the cuff



[Outro][Hook]
And shawty we all the way turnt up
All the way turnt up
All the way turnt up
All the way turnt up

Wala no leash on my colla'

Smoke west coast kush

Fuckin' with that Lala

Niggas say they can't be seen
Ain't nobody lookin' though
Turn the heat up on that beef
Ain't nobody cookin' though
A section full of them bitches
That Yo Gotti Lookin' foe

Yeah that's them 5 stars
They get money drive cars
They got them bangin' bodies
With out the knife scar
They take them shots to the head
And survive y'all... NICE

This the flyest shit you may have heard
We all the way up in this Too Short's favorite word

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]

Hit the spot like a god knowin' hoes and greenery
Watch full of cuts blowin' spinach check the scenery
East side high tryna not to spill my lean on me
Oh shit dope dick bet your woman feign on me

Mic check test 1, 2 blue sing on me
You destined for fame don't you be ashamed
Tune into the game if that's Patron James
Then call me Dwayne Spade
Ain't no body in my lane

Purple Rain True Trees Reggie Kush
She don't do meat call her Veggie Bush
I'm a fall back though I don't ever push
1 head 4 chicks 8 legs Octopus

Nigga you don't know all about that
I'm a Telemundo freakin for the weekend
Eatin' clams mussels lobster
Kitchen bed sofa
Stretchin' like Rosa Acosta partna
You know I'm the coldest
On my North Pole shit
While you on your rockin' South Pole when it's cold shit

Don't ask me for hooks you can't afford my focus
Ya turns up Trigga turnt up[Intro]:
Bang
Problem: Whaat
DJ Drama: See me myself
Problem: Let me up in and I bet i'll make this thing bang
DJ Drama: Only time I'm really in the streets, is when you hear me on this fly shit
Problem: You know I'm from the hood, so all my homies bang
DJ Drama: I'll be at the studio but when it come to them streets, oh I got some niggas that'll go! Diamond Lane!

[Verse 1: Problem]
Sippin' on tequila
With some señoritas
All these hoes ratchet but they acting like divas
Come through speed, hoes all looking
Boy watch your threads, you'll get your life tooken
Goons ride like a roller, Push green like a stroller
Cold as Minnesota bitch hotter than Tacoma
Keep paper like folds
Who want the same thing?
Girl let me hit the thang-thang

[Hook: Problem]
You know I'm out the hood all my homies bang-bang
You know how I do it, all my shit bang

And when I'm up in it you know it's goin' bang

[Verse 2: Bad Lucc]
I make that pussy go bang (bang)
She rode me like a train
I go crazy deep and it insane
Oh mama that bitch can't hang
I beat it like a case
She squirted in my face
She laughed when she did it
Until I swam in it
Looked her in her eye gave her everything she needed
I call that thing kunta because that pussy i defeated
Lucky lucky git
Baby let me warn ya'
I worked that body like some shit straight off of Pornhub
She lookin' crazy but I'm running California
In diamond lane dick straight up haunt ya'
Put that on your kids, you didn't run little mama she done
Told her sit on my face, better yet jump on this tongue
"Got 'em crazy, he shady" is what they say when he done
Make that pussy gangbang on the hood she the one

[Hook: Repeat]

[Verse 3: Game]
It's a reason why they put me last
Problem riding shotgun, Bad Lucc on the gas
Four pipes hangin' out the ass
C-Compton for real, you ain't gotta ask
That's the turf nigga, roll the grass
World star knockout king, nigga fuck or pass
Unless you bang what I'm banging
I'm repping Cedars put you in Cedars, don't look at my chain
I tell the waiter hurry up them guns is very us
Got my shooters in this bitch nigga Steph Curry(ed) up
Golden State Warriors is back putting hoes in your snapback clack like that
You ain't never met a muhfucker rap like that
Sold 12 million records still strapped like that
And niggas say they want a problem in the back
You ain't even know I had Problem in the blacklist

[Hook: Repeat]

Outro[Intro: Kevin]
Yeah, this ya boy Kevin Hart aka Chocolate Droppa, ya knowm saying
Real Husbands of Hollywood season 1 was a smash
Which means season 2' gotta be an even bigger smash

[Verse 1: J. B. Smoove]
Ah yeah--somebody knocked on the door
I said it must be J. B. Smoove in the piece
Yo son you wanna see me, pull out your smart phone and IMDB me
I was real long before the show
Ask my wife Shah, she'll let you know
Don't question me, but act like ya heard
Had enthusiasm long before curb
Me and Matt Damon bought a zoo
I live my life, thrill to thrill
Just like my man Jonah Hill
Cartoon voices I bring to life
Robot Chicken, Black Dy-na-mite
A show called The League and another called Bent
Thats not my resume, it's only a dent
So I'm bound to get paid on season 3
Or no JB on BET
JB is the mothafuckin' shit

[Break: Kevin]
The cypher continues

[Verse 2: Duane Martin]
Last year breakaway suit
New Gear breakaway boots
The truck that I drive got a breakaway roof
When I get old I got the breakaway tooth
Breakaway show, breakaway spoof
I'm from Brooklyn, so you know I'm about the truth
Yo we so hot, other networks not
Started from the bottom, now we at the top
Real Husbands got the number one spot
We so conceited, cause the other shows conceded
Yo check it out my album in stores September 35th, go cop that

[Break: Kevin Hart]
Breakaway suits the cypher continues

[Verse 3: Boris Kodjoe]
Sowas habt ihr noch nie gesehen
Das Jahr des Ochsen in China, 1973
Mutter Deutsch und der Vater aus Ghana, das ist Afrika
Und ich geh nach Amerika
Ein Traum, kaum zu glauben bis ich da war
No regrets it's a blessing to share a messaging
In my native languaging
All of these fools don't know what I'm saying though
Checking the subtitles while watching their own show
Who's the tallest? The ballest?
The one with the flawless, the finest
The halfest, the wideness [?]
The german chocolatest, the ab checkers
The one who nevertheless can teach you all some culture facts
"Real" is "echter", "husband" is "Ehemann"
Hollywood really dummy? Hollywood is Hollywood
They call us mitches with attitude
Who's they? Who do you think?
It's Kev, it makes him feel good

[Break: Kevin Hart & Nick Cannon]
It just got real...the cypher continues
That's a monkey with him
We gon' Wild Out, I appreciate you
How you gonna talk about my staff like that? Don't take none of this ish personally man

[Verse 4: Nick Cannon]
Yo I guess Nelly said it's hot in here cause Kev took his shirt off
Question for his chest though--how you get that bird off?
Kevin Hart, definition of a jerk off
Fuck Chocolate Drop, your name Hershey Squirt Off
Bunch of mitches
Watch me get this work off
Fuck rappin' y'all should've had a twerk off
I'll tell ya like this real tight
Matter fact we'll have a battle tonight
I'm better than all y'all
On top like a satellite
Matter fact none of y'all even had a wife
Y'all brought knives to a mothafuckin' cannon fight

So I'll repeat, sucka sucka sucka
And I never liked you anyway you pretty mothafucka
Nino Brown shit, yeah I said it

[Break: Kevin Hart]
Well I thought we were all together today
The cypher continues

[Verse 5: Nelly]
How I see now I'm the one they expect to spit
No boss thus far, no Ross no Rick
K-I-N-G, shout out to Tip
The only rapper in this bitch, no disrespect to Nick
More heart than Kevin, mo' tall and all
The realest husband in hollywood, no wife at all
Above the rim before Duane could crawl
I was soul foodin' chicks before Boris was tall
Not all, now here's the news
I pick 'em up and drop 'em off to [school](undefined)
Larry David made J. B. smoove
I let J. B. hang with me and now J. B.'s cool
You got a fool in your crew?
Nigga please, my whole crew is the fool
Season 1 was the shit too cool
Now season 2, yeah a nigga renewed
And uh, keep that to yourself
And just watch me as I pat the wealth
And uh, step back with the Versace scarf
And uh, no tip, no biff, no barf
Nigga what you say? Check the mise
Is them pants leather? So is mines

[Verse 6: Chocolate Droppa]
Save the best for the last so let's get it
Drop a hunk of beef for a second so I can spit it
Matter of fact keep it going
I'm about to get raw, let's go
We wear white cause doves cry
This ain't your alibi
Smack your girl then say "haha"
Take it back cause I wanna say "bye"
Saw you last week didn't like your face
Saw you this week in the same place
That mean I don't travel
That mean I stay in the same place
Got your spit in your face
I got your girl looking (motions to body)
And she wearing all lace
Buck, buck, bang bang that's a gun homie
Look at you, what you wanna do? Run homie
I'm mad, I'm glad at the same time feeling all sad
I miss my dad
And sometimes that shit make me mad
But I'm back at being a real nigga
Spittin like I'm Tommy Hilfiger
Didn't like my clothes so I took em off
Now look at me, cough cough
That mean I'm sick
I'm too legit to quit
Like hammer without the dance moves
I'm looking at you and JB Smoove
Yeah run, run homie
Yeah that's Bobby Brown homie
Yeah, he is the king
I'm doing this cause he's a chicken wing
I'm on fire now
Look at me, man pull me out now
If you don't then say it won't stop
Man at the end of the day it's Chocolate Droppa[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
On a bathroom wall I wrote
"I'd rather argue with you than be with someone else"
I took a piss and dismiss it like "fuck it"
And I went and found somebody else
Fuck arguing and harvesting the feelings
Yo, I'd rather be by my fucking self
Till about two a.m. and I call back
And I hang up and I start to blame myself
Somebody help...
You used to cry cause both your parents was addicts and your sister was ratchet
So I made it my mission to get you up out of that shit
Probably my fault for trying to be a hero when I can't be
Or your fault for sending me DM's that said "Save me"
Shit I was trying, I know that we been had some ups and downs
At Xzibit house, found out you and some nigga fucking now
Lied and said you told him about us and that he don't mess with you
Well if ya'll ain't fucking, why the fuck this nigga texting you
While you was sleeping I'd go and pick up your phone
And said "babe is you okay? And let me know when you coming home"
So I put you on a plane like I'm done with you
I fly back to Flint and I'm back in the back of the whip choking and fucking you
I know you ain't getting this type of dick from that local dude
You was running game on me like this nigga was coaching you
I'm fucking girls over while you was fucking some other dude
In the beginning saw something in you, but that just wasn't you
Love no cost a thing, and that's why I wouldn't cheat
Western Union every week so you and your daughters could eat
Western Union every week so you and your kids could sleep
On a bed while your sister would throw you out on the street
Thought if I showed you California and the shit that I was doing with the music
You would stop being so motherfucking stupid
I wouldn't try to buy you, I tried to be by you
Wanted you and the girls to have a fucking better life too
Came home for Christmas, I think it was on a Friday
Drive to your crib, homies’ car was already in the driveway
I walked to the door, my future flashed before my eyes
I'm finally signed and I'm about to give it up over pride
See I just left Hawaii and now I'm standing in the hood arguing with a nigger over a bitch I was calling wifey
This nigga stood in front of you and said you was his side bitch, you still behind that nigga he looking at me like that's my bitch
Wanted to spazz, but we in somebody else's home
She kept telling me to leave cause she was already gone
1000 dollars in an envelope you can have it
I made sure you had it, even if I ain't had shit
Always said "Jon we're living too different lives"
Ain't know that's an excuse for you fucking two different guys
Outer beauty never hides the ugliness that's inside
Memories haunt my mind, but all I know is that I tried
Told you I'd leave you alone if you was really in love with him
We could never work cause you ain't never stop fucking him
It all was a lie, regardless of how I felt
Now I see you for who you are, can't do nothing but blame myself
For Real..[Hook]
Bound to fall in love
Bound to fall in love
(Uh-huh, honey)

[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
You fuck a nigga I fuck a bitch, do that make us even?
We not together so all in all does that make it cheatin'?
Buying flights every week like a nigga rich
Thousand dollars for a flight to fuck another nigga bitch
Good pussy got a nigga on some nigga shit
But, at least a nigga nigga rich
Late nights driving by your crib like okay
Bitch got me sitting in the whip like OJ
Bitch got me sitting in the whip like OJ
Thinking if I make the news the fuck Dre gon' say?
Tattoos on our fingers on some love shit
Tattoos on our fingers on some dumb shit
I can't believe this bitch was so see-through
Met the other nigga and he turned me into Mr Me Too
Said "I know how to make her squirt", I was like "Me too"
He used to drop her off at work, I was like "Me too"
I picked the kids up from school, he was like "Me too"
Said she was pregnant, shit that could've been my seed too
The same shit that make you cry, it kinda make you laugh
I hurt so many good girls fucking with your crazy ass
Bound

[Hook (Connor Talking)]
(I know when I'm fucked up
I know, nigga I know when I'm fucked up
Ya'll niggas be fronting, nigga I ain't
Shit nigga, you know what I'm saying?
It's real right?)

[Verse 2: Jon Connor]
Feeling like I'm stuck with you
I keep saying I'm done with you
My friends say they can't fuck with me, if I choose to fuck with you
They don't want to stick around to see Titanic sink
I mean damn, what would Jeromey Romey Romey Rome think?
Both of us have made mistakes, ain't been the same ever since
Now we stalking Facebook, Twitter, Instagram for evidence
Ask me do I love her, then the answer gon' be fucking yes
It's a vicious circle, how I get out of this fucking mess
Conflicting stories, my life is Maury on a daily basis
Say I ain't gon' fuck this bitch again-- Then she get naked
Everybody drained from our shit, it ain't no one to tell
Your friends and my friends both saying we dumb as hell
We both grown as fuck but we acting young as hell
Damn near fist fighting, ain't happy 'til either one in jail
Bound

[Hook] (Connor Talking)]
(Know what I'm talking about?
Man this shit outta control my nigga look
Check it out)

[Verse 3: Jon Connor]
Yo' mama hate me, sister hate me, the fuck I'mma do?
My mama hate you and my sister fucking hate you too
You act confused when we be talking like "Why ain't we cool?"
I'm like "Think really really hard bitch, what ain't you do?"
Got a baby daddy and this side nigga
And what makes it worse is he be hanging out with my niggas
So they tell me when you doing dirt
When you think I ain't alert
We both be cheating now it's a matter of who gon' do it first
Lord, it make me wonder why I like yo' ass
Either I'm in love or I'm a motherfucking psychopath
Shit's sad, we both be on some bullshit
Both be tryna pull shit
Off but we get caught by folks that both of us is cool with
My hood niggas be like "Damn she did my nigga wrong"
My hood niggas be like "Damn she got my nigga gone
Got my nigga calling 'round town, this nigga making songs
Never seen him like this, what the fuck my nigga on?"
Bound

[Hook (Connor Talking)]
(Be alright though, know what I'm saying?
Ain't the first time, won't be the last
Be the last time it happens like this though)

Momma I don't wanna see you hurting no more
Got a plan momma, you ain't gotta work no more

Family struggling, niggas is hustling
No reason for reasoning
They blaming the government

Tryna stack cheese thicker than the government
Two twin bricks and I call em the doublemint
Immigration laws, I don't follow that
I got Mexican friends and the streets loving it
I got plug and I ain't talking where the gangs at
Columbian shit, nigga I can go direct
Cause they a blanco nigga, the head haunch o nigga
Hundred bands on your head, show you that ain't your nigga
Put a ring, or it ain't your bitch
Put in work on that mission or it ain't ya lick
Put ya title on the line, or it ain't ya whip
You got keys to the crib but what about ownership
Huh, boss shit I'm on the next level
Rolli watch no stones, sky dweller
AP rose gold that's a buck 80
All I want was a key of coke and a new Mercedes
I was born in the 80's, get money in the 90's
I'm a real hustler aiming
Baking soda pot, watch it rise and rock
Take it to the block, seven hundred a pop

Lets exercise of you niggas[Hook: Miguel]
I wanna kiss your mind, babe
Let's take a walk on the clouds
Let me taste your thoughts, babe
Let's take a walk on the clouds

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Last night I fell asleep counting a million cash
Life wild, I only smile when I see my stash
Large yacht, fast money, she need a slow cruise
Cigar, ciroc, her nigga old news
Old money always put me on my new shit
Hermes ahead in my to-do list
Rollin up a laugh, take a walk in the clouds
Take a look at my niggas, young, rich and we wild
Ain't no bitches allowed, acting like snitchin' in style
Got this gold on my neck, we teachin' new principles now
Startin' the Lotus, revvin' the motors
Walk on the clouds, we ain't second to no one

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
I got you walkin' on cloud nine
Your shoe collection not as proud as mine
You only second to my first love, pie
But just refer to her as alpine
Alpina, the B7 on beach headin'
Like you riding on first class to reach heaven
Close enough to see the gates open
Waterfront, you gon' wonder if the lakes open
Balconies have you bend over
Chanel samples being sent over
Shit, I swear she was goin' for me
Right, just keep it tight and keep it warm for me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Curren$y]
I could never go broke, what my name is?
I'm a brand, I'm a man who became rich
New car, new crib, but I ain't a switch
The same old niggas I been with
Got this loot together sayin' ones gon spend it
Circle of winners baby girl I done brung you in it
No iPhone pictures, you gotta live off memory
Pop the hood I show you the engine
Roll through my old hood, put you up on my history
Smoke joints with my niggas and cash stunts on them bum ass niggas
I don't deal with, we done caught fire
Let them suckas catch feelings but they can't reach us
We in the God ceilings, cathedral-style homes
Rosaries in my Rolls Royce, God put me on
Rollin' somethin' choice, lighten up raw cones
She never won' come down, I promise her she won't

[Hook]Ooo Got damn Got Damn

[Chorus]

[Verse 1: JB Smoove]
Yo son you wanna see me?

Ask me wife Shah she'll let you know
Dont question me, you better act like you heard
Had enthusiasm, Im a movie for a curl
Cartoon voices I bring to life
Robot Chicken, Black Dynamite
A show called The League and one called Bent
That's not my resume, it's only a [?]
Bouta get paid, it's season 3

People be like JB Smoove you so crazy
Don't hold me back I'm about to get ill
JB Smoove is motherfucking real

[Verse 2: Duane Martin]
Last year, breakaway suit
New gear, breakaway boots
If I gotta drive, gotta breakaway roof
When I get hot got the breakaway tooth
Breakaway show, Breakaway spoof
I'm from Brooklyn so you know I'm about the truth
Yo, we so hot, other networks not
Started from the bottom, now we at the top
Real Husbands got the number one spot!
Man I'm so conceited, other shows can seed it

[Verse 3: Boris Kodjoe (Translated)]
Born in the year of Ox, 1973
Mother is German, the father from Ghana, Africa
Then off to America, a dream, hard to grasp, until I got here
No regrets, it's a blessing, hear a message
In my native language, all these fools don't know what I'm saying
Checking those subtitles or watching that old show (Oooh)s
Who's the tallest, the balers with the flawers
Working with finest, half the [?]
Half the wifest
The German chocolate The ab protecter
Teach all of you some culture  facts
[?]
Hollywood, real dummy? Hollywood is Hollywood
They call us mitches with attitudes
Who's day? Who ya think? It's Kev, it makes him feel good

[Verse 4: Nick Cannon]
I guess Nelly said it's hot in herre cause Kev took his shirt off
Question for his chest though, how you get that bird off
Kevin Hart definition of a jerk-off
Chocolate drop your name is Hershey squirt off
Both mitches, tryin to get this work off
Rappin, that shit had a twerk- off
I'm a tell you like this real nice
Manner a fact we gon' have a battle tonight
I'm better than all of ya'll
On top, like a satellite
Better yet none of ya'll even had a wife
You brought knives to a motherfucking cannon fight

If you wanna get with it then spit it, facial expression
Look like you just shitted
To all these people goin' Sucka, Sucka, Sucka
Never liked you anyway
You pretty motherfucker

I thought we was all together tonight...

[Verse 4: Nelly]
[?] I'm the one they expect to spit
No boss this far, no Ross, no Rick
K-I-N-G, shout out to Tip
The only rapper in this bitch no disrespect to Nick
Kevin think he all tall and all
Real Husband in Hollywood no wife at all
Above the rim before Dwayne before he could crawl
Still foolin before Duane was tall
Not all, but here's the news
Pick em up and drop me off the school
Larry David made JB Smoove
No JB hang with me now JB's cool
You got a fool in your crew?
Please my whole crew is a fool
Season 1 was the shit, it cool
Season 2 shit was renewed
Keep that to yourself
Watch me as I pet the wealth
Step back in a Versace scarf and
No tip no bif no barf
What you say?, check the mines
Cause those pants are leather
They sure look nice

Check it, they say they save the best for last, lets get it

[Verse 5: Kevin Hart]
We wearing white cause doves cry
This ain't yo alibi
Smack yo girl and say ha ha
Take it back cause I wanna say bye
Saw you last week didn't like your face
Saw you this week I the same place

Got your spit in your face
Got your girl lookin at, she wearing all lace
Buck, Buck, Bink, Bink, thats a gun homie
Look at you now what you wanna do now, run homie
I'm mad, I'm glad, at the same time feeling all sad

That pops shit that shit make me mad
But I'm back to being a real nigg-
Spittin like I'm Tommy Hilfiger
Didn't like my clothe so I took it off
Now look at me
Cough Cough

I'm looking at you and JB Smooth
One, One homie

Im on fire now
Man look at me, put me out now
[?] This sound won't stop
At the end of the days its jock drop you man!

[Outro: Kevin Hart]
Man I miss my dad yo....[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
(Cannon)
So I'm watchin' her fine ass
Walk to my bedroom, and thought to myself
"That's the shape of things to come"
She said, "Why you in the club, you don't make it precipitate?
You know, make it rain when you can make it thunderstorm?"
I'm like, "Why?"
The world needs sun
The hood needs funds
There's a war going on and half the battle is guns
How dare I throw it on the floor
When people are poor
So I write like Edgar Allen to restore - got a cord
Umbilical attached to a place that can't afford
No landscaping, or window draping
This old lady told me
If I ain't got nothin' good, say nathing
That's why I don't talk much
I swear it don't cost much, to pay attention to me
I tell like it is, then I tell it how it could be
The hood be
Requesting my services
Oh don't get nervous it's
Step yo game up time
These ain't them same old rhymes
Designed to have you dancin' in some club
Niggas ride to me women be off in they tub
Ex-foliating with they poms-poms
Yelling, "Go 3000!"
I'm in my whatever bumpin' N.W.A
"A 100 miles and"
Runnin' Runnin' Runnin' Runnin'
Summon
Woman
Come in
Sit down, heard you need some plumbin'
Done in
I'm in
A swell mood
A rather swole mood
Until she told me that she told dude
That she'll be back, she's going to the store
I didn't know she had a boyfriend, so the door
I pointed her to
I said, "Call me when ya'll break up"
"I don't fuck nobody bitch
And never owned a Jacob," know what time it is
Nigga just
Tryin' to live like a Nigga supposed to live
If I still drank that malt liquor
I'd pour the beer
On the ground for niggas not around;
I started off starvin'
Now they got me out here Brett Favre'n
Trynna' see if I still got it... (got it...)
I guess it's like a bike think about it...

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
So I peep this bitch in V.I.P
I used to clip like Rob the barber
It seems she couldn't shape up
Cupcake her, I didn't bother
She's a follower a hell of a swallower
Not a leader
Got her 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th string
I didn't need her
I didn't mean to treat her
Like she was the main feature
Presentation, heard ya's a traitor
To the situation, more like a hassle
Because she had no keys to the castle
The queen sits on the throne
While this ho ride down Old National
(ZOOM) gon' head' ho beat ya feet
DR-DR-Drop down and get yo eagle on freak
We ever-so-discreet with this meet
Got a whole lot to lose if paparazzi
Ever shot or shoot we
Meaning me and you
Us together in the lens
My ends would be gone
Just like some "Dro in the Wind"
Told da ho you gonna win
Sho' 'nuff we gon' pretend
To the land of make believe
Now come on and hit this Hen...
Taking shots to the neck
Now that's love in ya mou-outh
Now we're Aphilliates
So don't give me the Gangsta Grill
No Drama it makes no sense
I got a mean ass backhand
And a (Cannon) that don't miss
Bitch
