[Verse 1: August Alsina]
You're looking so good right now
And I would if I could, pull you right now
But I know that you're the type to make 'em crazy
Cause you've got all my homies tripping on you lately

[Hook: August Alsina]
Think you put something in the air
Your body's so amazing, and one could even say it's blazing
You're wrapped tight, oh, you've got it going on
Cause you keep your hair nice
Oh, and I ain't even tripping cause my homies hit first
Cause baby, when I hold you, I know we can make it work
So let me get your contact and the place I can meet you at
Baby, let me hit that super loud
Super strong, super green, got me super gone
I know that's super on, and I'm super high
I'm like Superman, cause I'm super fly
I need that super loud
Super strong, super green, got me super gone
I know that's super on, and I'm super high
I'm like Superman, so baby, let me hit that

[Verse 2: August Alsina]
Now you look good enough to eat
And every time we kiss, it's Swisher Sweet
I feel a spark every time we meet, yeah
Yeah, you do things to me

[Hook: August Alsina]

[Verse 3: Curren$y]
When I wake up in the morning, the first thing I do is
Wash up, make sure I'm presentable, before I lay one fingertip on you
Every day I'm in the whip with you
Crack the windows, let them look-at-whose come close, get a little whiff of you
My old thing and my newer Coupe, ain't nothing changed
Addicted to that, lifted off that
Every time that I hear your name, I'm ready to let that paper flip
I never been labeled as a trick, but I'll pay for it if I want it
I'm always high, stuck in the moment
Had a convo with one of my homies, told me 'bout when y'all first met
How viciously you put it on him
I couldn't even get mad about it, I was glad one of my partners got it
Super loud but she's super soft, softer than a whisper
Ain't no gold digger, but I ain't never seen her 'round no broke niggas
Come smoke with me

[Hook: August Alsina][Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Got no time for the conversations or funny shit
Nigga, only the reals who I get my money with
Used to turn on the TV, see what I want
And now the same one I dreamed about, the same one I'm stuntin' in
In the 6-2, almost 26
And every nigga that I'm with got a zip
I look at this shit as one big table and best believe every nigga I'm with got a sit
They try to hold us back, paint a picture of us, then sell it straight to the public
You young, black, then you thuggin'
What they don't talk about the kid that came from nothin'
Who stuck to what he believed in and turned himself into something great
They should use that story to motivate
But instead they'd rather focus on the fact that he's a pothead
Not the fact there's not a lot where I lived
25 and not dead

[Hook:]
I'm tryna tell you somethin', this shit's real
When you work hard to get it that's how you feel
The man that start what they knew and they ain't (?) away
We started small to them houses in the hills
To them houses in the hills
Houses in the hills
Houses in the hills
To them houses in them hills

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
You make a little money, take care and right yourself
And people start coming up with they hand out
People take their stresses and make them yours
Well that's just what comes with being a man
I try to do all that I can to make sure that
My son grow up without having to see half of the stuff I've been through
But in life we all got our own path
Don't understand that by now you won't begin to
Cop another Rollex or Porsche try and get even with me
Pulled up to the club, swear it looked like the dealer with me
Cause we had so many cars it was stupid
So I don't see a reason to try and reason with me
Made a couple million and fast too
They ain't teach a young nigga that in the classroom
Or how to make your people better by taking knowledge and spreadin' it
Instead bein' in the game, be ahead of it, in a better whip

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: Curren$y]
Thousand dollar benefit plates
No matter how high the stakes, niggas never outta place
Now I'm high, Empire State
Drunk stumblin', never will I tumble far from grace
I'm one of them under-celebrated greats
Under the influence of what Uncle Snoop threw me
Soon as I stepped off the plane
Switchin' four lanes like Jay and Jermaine
Killin' beats, visitin' grave sites and pissin' champagne
I been in the crib enjoying my habits
Suckers figured this'll be the perfect time to try me
Try me
Assumptions that I'm lunchin', gettin' sloppy
I'm just gettin' better, seasoned veteran
Eagle eye perspective, scope before I go in
Come out with the whole hen
A dollar and a dream
Have a house on the hill and the world on a screen

[Hook:][Verse 1]
And they say they ballin', but I do it how the pro's do
Where we goin' next week I let my hoes choose
No socks in my boat shoes
Guess a nigga eatin' good like Whole Foods
Not a couple cameras now they bring the whole crew
Bad bitch ride with me, so she pose too
See me and my guys like a plane flown through
Hella high roll up weed up like I'm supposed to
And now I'm into big things
On the buildin' you need to know the tenant rate
Gettin' paid still ridin' no shirt
Let a bitch give me brain call it home work
Niggas try hatin' on 'em but it don't work

[Hook]
A lotta shit done changed, new clothes, new car, new thangs
The same boys that use to be at the bottom came up thatâ€™s what they say
Used to not be allowed in the building, but now we on the roof top
Used to not be allowed in the building, but now we on the roof top

[Verse 2]
Slow money just as bad as gettin' no money
But learn to get good show money, that's your money
Get comfortable with it, really know money
Rich nigga shit, that really goes for me
Self made nigga, well played
I'm on the plane drinkin' champagne and lemonade
You tryna copy what's done, I'm tryna innovate
And club owners gettin' tired of tryna ventilate, big mistake
I'm too busy findin' places and trips to take
The more I smoke the more money my business make
Remember they used to be like who is this?
Now, I'm up in this bitch, they light up like independance day
When you around the real, you keep it real everyday
My niggas keep it real, so I hear what they say
Either you gettin' paid or you payin' to play
Either you on your grind or you stay out the way

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Curren$y]
Just made a million, got another million on my schedule
The pick up on my Ferrari, you jets or you jetless
You niggas ain't help us, on second thoughts you did
They hatin' was the fuel for this shit
So you wrote your own check off a ho ass
Sweatin' bullets at home, wonderin' if she comin' back
Whodi you a simp and she can smell it on ya
That's why you only see her when you buyin' stuff for her
We was sneakin' in then it was general admission
Now we own the arena decidin' who allowed in it
My windows ain't tinted, pimpin', I ain't trippin'
Had showered that shit, I'm just ballin' and chillin'
We plotted this out, one night in the city
Now we Los Angeles, medicine cabinet twistin'
Our habits are expensive, we gotta have it
TwitPicin' when we get it and they mad at us, fuck them niggas

[Hook]

[Bridge]
A lotta money, lotta luggage, lotta hoes
When you puttin' in work, that's how it goes

[Outro]
And if the kids tryna be like me
They probably smokin' 'bout an O
Oh, ain't my fault though[Hook: French Montana]
Can't tell me nothing bout this feeling
You can't tell me nothing
Can't tell me nada
Oh la la, Ooh la la la [x2]

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Cut a moon roof in the '72
That's what the paper tell me do
Spaceship came through, slayed you
Thinkin' that the game new, fool who raised you?
I ain't got time to save you
Paydays I'm on the way to
State to state, many a stage and venue
The stoned saga continues
I'm fin to, collect more residuals
Off digitals and physical
Record in the fortress stable of Ferrari horses
Paved the driveway parked exotics on it
Looking at 'em just make me want more shit
I'm addicted to this hustle I'm so sick
Tug of war with my girl cause I can't split into two people
Wanna work just as bad as I wanna be with you
Sitting in my homeboys Regal, higher than a eagle
Thinking of a loophole to squeeze through
Leave to that paper that's church, cathedral
Take my Kangol off before I enter the bistro
Crooks gotta eat too, in a castle with platters of seafood
Lavish extravagance wishing it could be you
See you when I see you
And when I do don't be looking all evil and deceitful

100 spokes and new clothes [x4]

[Hook]

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Hopped out the blue smoking purple
Free boss don on my shirt
My niggas they always earn
Tell em niggas all lay down
Yeaa you remember me?
Connected from the bottom like the letter v
I turn strangers to best friends
Best friends to strangers, jealousy and anger
Same water soften up the potatoes, boil up the egg
It ain't where you from its your circumstance
Trips to Kansas, never question, answer
Had to build an empire, just to build a mansion
Got the bread left the bacon as salaam-alaikum
Why hate? Cop an i8 one weekend
Everyday's crunch time like the last point
If I don't make it i'll be talking through the glass joint

[Hook][Produced by Isabella Summers and Luney Tunez]

[Intro: DJ Khaled]
Our Lord, grant us good in this world
And good in the life, to come keep us safe from the torment of the fire
As we keep our hands up high and scream for justice
Ferguson, rest in peace Mike Brown
And all the young soldiers out there
God help us

[Hook: TGT]
Time to take a stand and save our future
Like we all got shot, we all got shot
Throwing up our hands don't let them shoot us
Cause we all we got, we all we got
God ain't put us on the Earth to get murdered, it's murder
God ain't put us on the Earth to get murdered, it's murder
Don't point your weapons at me

[Verse 1: Game]
Seen the pictures, feel the pain, scandalous how they murder son
Tired of them killing us, I'm on my way to Ferguson
Talked to TIP, I talked to Diddy, them my brothers walking with me
Mothers crying "Stop the riots", we ain't got to chalk the city
I seen Cole out there, felt I should go out there
They left that boy for hours in the cold out there
They killin' teens, they killin' dreams (It's murder)

[Verse 2: Diddy]
Yo, come on we gotta stick together, we all we got
Police taking shots and I ain't talkin' bout Ciroc
I'm talking bout Emmett Till, I'm talking bout Ezell Ford
I'm talking bout Sean Bell, they never go to jail for
Trayvon over Skittles, Mike Brown Cigarillos
History keeps repeating itself, like a Biggie instrumental
America's a glass house and my revenge is mental
Rather use my brain than throw a cocktail through a window

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
I got the keys to the city still we left in the cold
Hands in the sky, still was left in the road
Ribbon in the sky, Michael Brown, another soul
Stole by the system, black men we pay the toll
The price is your life, Uncle Sam want a slice
Black dress code now we looting in the night
Now we throwing Molotovs in this holocaust
And I know they hate to hear me screaming, 'I'm a Boss!'

[Hook: TGT]

[Verse 4: 2 Chainz]
Tired of the okie-dokie, lying you Pinocchio
Driving while black, tell me, where am I supposed to go?
Gun shots hit the car, now I got the holy ghost
If excessive force was a drug, then they overdosed
Got us tryna protest, it's a slow process
Heard it's a lot of rotten eggs in the crow's nest
People praying on they feet, police holding on they heat
Turned on the news and seen a tank rolling down the street

[Verse 5: Fabolous]
Yeah, I seen a lot of ice water tossed, and I know it's for a cause
My only question is, what we doing for the loss
Of Mike Brown? Cause right now, I challenge you to use your talents to
Speak up, and don't you ever let them silence you
Cause action speaks louder than words, that's what I heard
Shot down with his hands up, that's what occurred
Man that sound absurd
Matter fact to me that sound like murder
We want justice

[Verse 6: Yo Gotti]
Ay yo Game, I had a crib out there, I used to live out there
So I know how niggas feel out there
People stressing, protesting, unity is a blessing
So it's time we come together, use our voice as a weapon
I am Michael Brown, cause I stand for what he stand for
News say we're looting, paint pictures like we some animals
On my NWA CMG
Holl'in' "Rest in peace Eazy and fuck the police"

[Verse 7: Wale]
Heard another brother slain up in St. Louis
Sure the mother feel the pain, but what you famous doing?
Iâ€™m sure the general population trying to be more active
But when the light finally catches you, you're ice challenged
Okay, and I support the ALS just like the rest of them
But you have yet to pay your debt, so you just flexing then
Cause everybody care for a minute, then stop
People only there for a minute, then stop
And what's the point of giving if you ain't giving your all?
We never getting ahead, might as well give up your heart

[Bridge: TGT; Swizz Beatz in brackets]
Where does it end?
I got my hands up, what else am i supposed to do?
(Rest in peace to Mike Brown)
Where does it end?
(And all the other fallen soldiers)
Tell me, where's the love for everything we're going through?
(That will not be on the news or televised, ah)
Mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy me
Hope that God can save us
Mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy me
(As we lead in peace)

[Verse 8: Swizz Beatz]
Martin Luther King had a dream!
But they ain't respecting Jesse up out here
And they don't really respect Obama out here
Lights out, go dark it's like a nightmare
How the fuck you play the game, but they ain't playing fair
It's going down, Armageddon right here
Right now, not on TV, but right here
Put your flags in the air if you don't really care (Wave it)
We need justice, yeah, we need justice here

[Verse 9: Curren$y]
I heard he surrendered but we all saw how they did him
Television broadcasts, a confused country
I'm a resident of a nation that don't want me
What's done is done, the town erupts in fury
And I'm already hearing bout this lopsided jury
Three faces like his, the rest another story
A lot of motherfuckers need to act more worried

[Verse 10: Problem]
The revolution has been televised
If I sit here and do don't do nothing, homie, that's genocide
Fuck that, we have arrived!
And who cares who ain't on our side cause we on our own
How do you preach peace to a family that just lost they own?
My brodie Game just banged my line like "We gotta do something"
All that marching and that peace ain't gonna fucking do nothing
Fuck it, my moms, sorry, I'm ready to rage
The police done let the animals out of the cage, oh lord it's

[Hook: Game's daughter]

[Outro: Diddy]
Stand up[Produced by Harry Fraud]

[Hook: RiFF RAFF]
Feel so cold
I came up in the world so cold
Got my heart on froze, my heart on froze
Feel so cold
I came up in the world so cold
Got my heart on froze, got my heart on froze
I came up in this world so cold

[Verse 1: RiFF RAFF]
Yeah, uh, mind incoherent
Taint the days from the bad experience
I don't hit the line, I pass the interior
Exterior Phantom, seldom wait for stanza
Bout to hit a couple stories, boy scout lantern
Ca-ca-cathedral box, center stage like Chris Rock
Recline the top like Peter Pan drop
Drop a couple smells, top smells, top shelf
Ch-Ch-Cheddar melt
Fast forward silk chain made from Tinkerbell
Luxury coated, due to a couple pairs dancing
Marinara sauce on the seat belts, Versace fence
I'm Michael Phelps with the gold medallions
I pulled a couple stallions, my rims rattle
I ball like Ralph Samson, Riff!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Undefeated like my sweats, untouchable rep
Underrated, overhated, fuck 'em, I'm a jet
Life on the set, nigga, live and direct
Like an intercept, halt your progress
I  don't celebrate that touchdown yet
You soft as a night gown, clown, I see that right now
I'm cold, I'm froze like you should have wrapped them pipes
I'm cold, I'm froze like put some coats on them children
'Fore you let them outside
Getting strong off that green spinach, bitch; Popeye
Pot got me lazy in my long sleeve tie dye
Whippin' a Mercedes AMG 96 2 door 600
Alloy wheels on it, yeah
Introduce me to your best bitch, homie
Eyes can't hide her desire, she on me
Heart on fire for Mr. Frosty, I'm cold, yeah

[Hook][Verse 1: Berner]
Uh
Why you so dusty, boy I live plush
8AM, roll up, get sucked
200 pounds, throw it on a big truck
Get your chips up, Bern pulled up in a Benz truck
Where your friends at, tell 'em that the truth's here
Every night turn up like it's New Year
No stress just cookie and blue here
Damn, this shadow looks too clear
All around the world my name keep buzzin'
Rich off cook, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Me and [?] cousin
Can't see my face like lemme buy somethin'
Oh no, I used to move blow
I used to get money out of a high class ho
Now I just grow, I pull it all down
I trim it up nice, then I let it all go
My day burns slow, my crews on [?]
Coke white Benz on brand new rims
Make a girl spend, I just got 10
I blew it on gold and drinks with my friends
You know I said [?], you boys don't [?]
100 lights plus, no back seat
225 on my LB double
Smell-proof bag, I don't need no trouble
Before we had clear it was OG Bubble
200 mill, these boys don't hustle
Bern keeps the best price
TGOD Jet Life, Girl I'm the one
Take another shot, put a pill on your tongue
Preach, no sweet [?]
Get jaw from your girl, bet she'll break me off
That's right

[Verse 2: Futuristic]
Yo, talk is cheap, why speak, I rap
Double meaning, haters beef, then I feed off that
Double meaning, be on track, y'all beyond wack
I'm on the come up real quick like I beat off fast
I'm in the bottom in the grass, like snakes
I'm in the sky, like Drake's face on the CD case, annihilate
Annihilate, [?]
This nigga then me, big mouth gator
That means I'm greater, do me a favor
If you got weed then put it in raw papers
I been good like the candy Now and Later
Call up your neighbor and borrow some sugar
Who's your favorite rapper? I get picked like a booger
Rappers are signin' these deals, gettin' fucked
By these labels who pay you, that makes you a hooker
And it's crazy, I'm way better
Give me 46 opponents, I'm feelin' like Mayweather
Rappers say they cold, they feelin' like may weather
Me, I'm actually cold, I chill in eight sweaters
Focused on my endeavors, my flow has been kind of clever
No gimmicks, I got no image, no for real, hat in no leather
Introduce you to Futuristic, hi, it's been a pleasure
Introduce you to Futuristic twice and don't forget him
Jack Thriller said change my name
But as far as I know, bro, I rap, don't sing
And I don't fuck with a chick who supposedly had a dick
And I don't make tracks with Kanye and Wayne
That all sounds great, except the dick part
Killing Cyphers to get a kick start
Flow poison and I spit darts
I'm tryna get big like a kid's heart, for real
Said them fuck boys rest in peace
The recipe for me is to let me be
My cut, you shouldn't touch like an STD
I'm tryna check into the game like a guest in three
Earn stripes like a referee
Big fish in a small pond, Shark Tank invest in me
On June 9th my album's droppin'
Like an oxygen mask that's in a plane dang let me breath
I'm gone
Now I'm back
Now I'm gone for real
Put this on your iPod, CD-ROM

[Verse 3: Sincere Show]
One time for raw papers
Uh
King Show
It's gon' be alright doe
Look
Please don't be alarmed
There's storm before the calm
I was born to be a god
But praises to our lord
Even when the sun's out, I see the stars
Even when it's dark out, I see the stars, I'm a star
A nigga so south paw, a avatar
And I never hit the back of the bus, I'm Rosa Parks
Me and Louis [?]
Swag on point in this motherfucker, Stussy
I don't wear that shit but nigga I'm Gucci
Turn up bitch, we turn down for what
Down south for the winter, I'm a flyin' duck
Shots come, fly niggas better fly and duck
And some of y'all stories not addin' up
I got gold all on my neck and shit
I'm on some extra shit, I stay flexin' bitch
Still sippin' on exorcist
In your hood where my necklace is
Flow poison: Bell Biv DeVoe
Deja Vu, I don' lived here before
How a nigga make it in college from the go
What a city where I'm from it's the murder capitol
I came in the game and conceived the career
The vision I had it was clearer and clearer
These niggas had beef and they know where I live
Tell 'em come on, 2 straps then I bang out
That lame shit got you layin' down
Same crib nigga, same house
On the way to the money nigga, same route
I sleep with the lions, I eat with the pigs
I was raised by wolfs, a team of gorillas
I'm fly like an eagle, you niggas is rats
Gone

[Verse 4: KR]
I got a dream that's bigger than life
My nigga like can't you tell
I'm in the back of a black Acura
Gettin' sucked like Count Dracula, oh well
I should get a nobel peace prize for the rhymes that I spit
I'm high as a blimp
Give her this DVD, I'll probably piss on your CD
Beat these beats while you beat your meat
Why you fuckin' with a shark, you ain't got no teeth
Why you safe in a gang, you ain't in these streets
You a ho, you a bitch, you a straight pussy
I advise you little rap niggas, don't push me
I kick push, george bush, bet lupe see
Control my soul, now you can't play me
I ain't never fall in love cause I'm in too deep
You will never see it happen like a Kanye tweet
[?]
Schoolboy was a skinny nigga, prolly DDT
All you fake emcees that RIP, all these fuckin' beats
You niggas is 7 days cause you fuckin' week
Heard you niggas want to hate have a fuckin' seat
Been a real nigga since little nigga for real nigga
Now you shuffle the cards and tell me what's the deal with ya

[Verse 5: Curren$y]
2 door, super sport coupe
44 inches cut out the roof, son
Show these little ones what to do
Flow polished, show room new, quite accomplished
Underground pay dues, paid in full
Get paid major wages just to fall through
Roll cages in the vehicle, expensive and they dangerous
Lane switch, tryin' not to miss this plane, been
Flyin' for a long time, traveled to great distance
Cherishin' every minute of my existence
Cause it gets raw, there's a wall, I saw
Many things fall apart and given a new start
Got my low-rider parked, lightin' up in the dark
A little bit of my heart for free next time I charge
Shout out to the homie Fee
As we proceed[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Single engine Cessna
Amphibious landing gear, terrain treacherous here
Square groupers, blocks of white cheddar
Precious metals, butter soft leathers
Shakers and movers, business is booming
Lil nigga, you know who you in the room with?
Big boss, killer whales and sharks, ain't no tuna fish
We'll know who was fit when the casualties get tallied
There will be a list, carved in stone for all the soldiers buried
In this bloody mud, war on drugs
I just rap like it's packages, ducking the fucking fuzz
Jealous of my status, wan' know what it was
We'll put 'em in that position, to any bust can we link em?
But I'm four joints rolled up, back of that black tour bus thinking
Up more dope by the boatloads, stay afloat no sinking
100 spokes on the Lincoln, Rivieras on [?]
Parked outside the fortress, where the money ain't never sleeping

[Verse 2: Young Roddy]
My grandpa left me a Cadillac with the white walls
Was on a mission, hear my tires scratch off
Came up, fell back off
My momma sent me to the store to cop a pack of Newports
And a lotto ticket scratch off
Hope we hit that jackpot at least one time
Trying not to get locked out by one time
That cheddar on my mind I only see green, I'm color blind
Shout out to Sean John and [?] I'm tryna shine
With a hundred bag in my pocket
Seven grams you can acknowledge
Better watch out for your trail, this shit get real when the feds watchin'
I'm known to clock my dollars got his girl dancing topless
Better slow your roll Charlie I run laps around your posse
I spit 'til they start drowning ain't no love for the out of towner
My Chevy engine stay grinding, kept 100 shots in my chopper
That a hundred hoes in that lobby, got a bad bitch and she bout it
She tryna get to my home, I used to roll on chrome
Now I ride on 100 spokes, out[Chorus]
100 spokes and new clothes (x3)

[Verse 1]
Cut a moon roof in the '72
That's what the paper tell me do
Spaceship came through, slayed you
Thinkin' that the game new, fool who raised you?
I ain't got time to save you
Paydays I'm on the way to
State to state, many a stage and venue
The stoned saga continues
I'm fin to, collect more residuals
Off digitals and physical
Record in the fortress stable of Ferrari horses
Paved the driveway parked exotics on it
Looking at 'em just make me want more shit
I'm addicted to this hustle I'm so sick
Tug of war with my girl cause I can't split into two people
Wanna work just as bad as I wanna be with you
Sitting in my homeboys Regal, higher than a eagle
Thinking of a loophole to squeeze through
Leave to that paper that's church, cathedral
Take my Kangol off before I enter the bistro
Crooks gotta eat too, in a castle with platters of seafood
Lavish extravagance wishing it could be you
See you when I see you
And when I do don't be looking all evil and deceitful

[Chorus]
100 spokes and new clothes (x5)

[Verse 2]
Boat launch in the backyard
Warehouse garage, full of sports cars
Should inspire you to go for it
I did this you could do so much more
What you waiting on, we got planes to board
High before takin' off, pulling up in racers at the Bape store
Bout paper, my bank chase but baby girl I won't chase ya
I've got aim and a laser, red beam on a stack of green
Contact me if it's a major caper
A dollar and a dream
We can pull it off while them mufuckas sleep like they always be
Look to the set if you're looking for the best
No rest until I see all my dogs eat
Quest for greatness, hella early in the latest
You ain't even know they made this shit
Nigga

[Chorus]
100 spokes and new clothes (x5)[Hook x8]
I can take ten Gs, and make twenty more ten Gs with that

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'm back in this bitch
Though I never left
I just took a lil time, climb some trees by myself
Now I'm way up high, everything top-shelf
We ain't die last night, toast to good health
We was fly last night if I do say so myself
Had all eyes last night, them hoes ain't wanna miss the jet
Million dollars worth of Chevys, yeah bitch its da set
Andretti, they ainâ€™t ready, so I won't do it yet
Y'all can play for a couple of weeks
And I be back to destroyin' the streets
The homie Cardo keep sending me beats, and I smoke 'em
They think I'm selling drugs, nah, bitch, I'm just a dopeman
I woke up and I float from New Orleans to Oakland
The bro Cellski left the green door open
I'm in the Nova, that 383 stroking
Gas or that cash flow, that's what keep me going

[Hook x8]

[Verse 2]
Now I turn the corners, yo bitch watching my car
Got that weed burning, she wish she could hit the raw
Now she's lurking, cause she like what she saw
On Twitter and Instagram, searching the bar
'Til by chance we meet again, don't be sleeping in
On the outside, peeking in
On your tiptoes tryna see over our fence, ho
It's quite simple, see you was fishing for simps
We not them though, focus up, this game soak it up
She can't handle it, it's choking her, whoa
Open that door before she barf on my Monte Carlo floor
Sorry, no, we can't kick it no mo'
Must go back to the Gold rush, brush
Bust through, knock down all those who would oppose
Us getting dough, yo, let's all be millionaires

[Hook x8][Intro: Curren$y]
Let's all be millionaires

[Hook (x8): Curren$y]
I can take ten G's, and make twenty more ten G's with that

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
I'm still at it, they still mad
Her friends hated, but I still smashed
She went braggin' how much fun she had
And now them hoes wanna roll, but that jet done passed
Steak and shrimp on the plane 'til it's 'bout to land
Learn to correctly say the name of where I really am
Buyin' antiques, foreign lamps
Passport, stamps on every page
Old head paper like Zig-Zags, bitch I've been paid
New Benjamins, Raw wraps, cones to the dome
Lone Ranger park the Range on the range
Countin' twenty G's in my D-boy stance
Rap like keys, open vaults to the racks
Niggas like me want all of that, and some mo' of that
Go on and show me where they store it at (go on)
Let's all be millionaires
I heard they got a whole lot of shit in there

[Hook (x8): Curren$y]

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Hundred G's on one block, gave straps, go move blocks
We move blocks on one block
I told my nigga we close shop
'89 we came through, that triple beam, we weigh it through
Nigga wanna play games, nigga
We size 'em up when we come through
Them thangs came, we did that
They say, we did that
Came down from H-Town, I told a nigga we moved that
Uptown my block, nigga
We came through, straight stock, nigga
People came, we popped, nigga
Ain't nothin' came from gettin' money
We did that
Catch me stuntin', nigga, every time, so we live this
Top floor, we grind, nigga
When I stunt, nigga, we shine, nigga
It's big money all the time, nigga
It's my life, big time, nigga
New whips, new bitches, nigga
Got that forty with the clip, nigga
Mill on my mind, nigga
Fuck 'em nigga headline, nigga

[Bridge: Curren$y]
Let's all be millionaires

[Hook (x8): Curren$y]

[Verse 3: Gunplay]
I can take nothin', turn it to stuntin'
I do it for ya'll, cause ya'll thought that I couldn't
Told my momma we made it, she said you finally famous
She say that's a blessing, knowing how cut-throat this game is
Turn a five to a ten, a ten to a Benz
Turned one crack rock into a neck full of gems
Had no choices or options, forced to be great
When you walk amongst bosses, hope you relate
Grew up poorer than most, nigga had no bread
But I was holdin' my toast, my back touchin' my ribs
Had to get it, by any means, necessary
Never scary, goin' hard like I won't be ever buried
Boxed in these projects, never felt my palm itch
Niggas lifes cut short by these long clips
How I made it out, still a mystery
Cause Lord knows (how treacherous these mean streets can be)

[Hook (x8): Curren$y][INTRO: CURREN$Y]
Yup, yea, yea, JETS, nigga
Fuck boys wondering if they bitch next
Spitta
Nigga
(Took another pull of the potent)
16 Switches Spitta
(Dope tracks, he dozin', spitta get them...)
Ya'll niggas scared of monsters?

[VERSE 1]
I don't bang, I spit the good rhymes
The whole scenery reminding me of Good Times
Cause I'm, posted, toasted up
By my hood bitch, she rolling up ganja
I'm reading over scripts for a HBO drama
Mo' zeroes, mo' commas
Mo' pretty drunk bitches piled in my Impala
6-3 drop top, just like Doughboy
Do we got a problem?
Hope not nigga, just tryna have a good time
Cause I heard there's hoes out
Whoa now, told her I don't like her
Rocking with her toes out
I'm after Jenny with the Foamposite Pennys
These niggas is actors
They need Emmys
These bitches wear me out like Fendi
Again, these niggas is actors
Give 'em all Emmys
These Bitches wear me out like Fendi
Spitta!

[HOOK]
I'm just lokin'
Sunroof open
Took another pull of the potent
Hit the three wheel motion
Throw him
Dope tracks, he goes in
Spitta get them bitches wide open

I'm just lokin'
Sunroof open
Took another pull of the potent
Hit the three wheel motion
Throw him
Dope tracks, he goes in
Spitta get them bitches wide open (open)

[VERSE 2]
I even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read "Spitta please don't quit
Cause you that shit
Them niggas ain't like you
They don't make that shit to smoke and ride to like you do"
I admit that it's true
I'm good at which I do
I can show you the proof
Cop a coupe and put the footage on YouTube
"Spitta you that nigga"
Ladies tell me on the daily
Hit my Myspace and put the ringtones on they cellies
I'm on the couch, eyes glued to the telly
Watching Family Guy
Waiting for Brian to sing "Peanut Butter & Jelly Time"
Rarely I'm seen on the clube scene lately
Cause in my city, it's a couple DJs hating
Homie I'm saying, na fuck it, I'm laying up in the crib
Swiss cheese, sliced turkey
On top of the Ritz
Cracker, that's that shit
When you get as high as I get
I got the munchies
Tell your honey make some more for me, bitch
(yea, yea, that's it, that's it, that's the one right there)

[HOOK/OUTRO]
Dope tracks, he dozin'

Shit nigga, my mind on the dough, ridin' round in that bowtie got the shift on the floor
You dont know where these niggas minds at when they plot on the dough
So i ride around extra burner, extra clips in the door
Gettin' paranoid in the day people might kick in the door
But when u paper chase you chase that paper far as it go
Cause id rather be tired from hustlin', then tired of havin' nothing
So i go out the way to make sure my pockets stay straight
Nigga i go alil' further, same streets swore they murdered
Same streets i call home might lead me to a goner
But i ride for this corner & ever nigga thats on it
I seen the best come and go niggas even die with it on 'em
& i can't call it, just answer everytime that money is calling
She call me, dog, just what she only callin' me cause im ballin'
They all doubted underestimated and underrated, its all good fuck them niggas as long as they dont underpay me

[Curren$y]
La la la la la la la la
My steerin' wheel wood, my weed hella' good
My rolex yellow gold, im flexin on them hoes
Them bitches strike a pose, they hopin' that i look
Im finna head home love you tryin get took
Jet life & i wrote it down in eli's book
Im higher then the plane, wayne writin down hooks
Couple bars here & there, couple honeys on the lair
See my camp get low, love can't stop the crooks
Rap moves for the paper, every caper, every jooks??
Keep gas in the scrapers, and them haters not my neighbors
Got some marksman insuring me that they on the roof
They help me sleep better, dozed off, countin cheddar
Woke up, washed up, rolled up to the loot
Polygraph in the booth make every line a truth
An a eye for an eye, & a tooth for a tooth
Leave alot of niggas blind & unable to chew![Verse 1: Trademark Da Skydiver]
I stay on top of my game Iâ€™m sayin no time for playin
Paper on my mind
Doing business with whoever paying the most
Fast or slow, I gotta get this dough
Touched a few pieces off features but I still want more
What the fuck you think Iâ€™m grinding for
Tryin to upgrade my automo-
Stacking bills, smoking kill, chilled out with my foreign ho
First night with the villain resort life, we just burning O's
Smashed at got my mind back to where the cash at, You know how it go
Iâ€™m out the door my mind focus on dough, Iâ€™m so fixed on these digits
But she swear a nigga out here fuckin around with this other bitches
And I ain't got no time for that, tryin to get to this money love
Homie trust, Iâ€™m only gettin my paper up
Counting Franklins, Jacksons, Grants
You can tell from all these paper cuts, on my hand
I been on the straight plan to make millions out of grands so
All I ask is you keep it real it's Super Ville in Jet Life we trust
Stay away from them lames, they look the same but them niggas ain't us

[Hook: Curren$y] x2
Put my hustle down got my money up
All them bitches come around cause my niggas coming up now
We put our hustle down got our money up
All them bitches run to us cause they donâ€™t want no runners up, clown

[Verse 2: Young Roddy]
Nigga I go Deebo hard or I'll carry my ass home
But Iâ€™ll be damn if it's back to living up in that drug zone
Shit and I know thatâ€™s right but how they getting but I don't call that wrong
In the midst of it all nigga we stay G while we drop bombs
Wait but hold on let me find something roll up on
They say itâ€™s now or never just hoping now it donâ€™t take too long
Iâ€™m on my paper chasing we chasin bread and itâ€™s marathon
Yeah I love pussy but plenty of nights I done slept alone
I done it on my own just me myself and my microphone
And til my next life I yell Jet life til Iâ€™m dead and gone
Stay high up when the loud pack its that Cali strong
Ain't no child play no need for that girl both us grown
Frontin ain't paying nobody bills better keeps your hustle going
Over these camp fire I tell my ghetto story
I put my life in this bars but they still donâ€™t know me
In this fast lane I move slowly Iâ€™m focused nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sir Michael Rocks]
Mann..

JET Set, real niggas, 1st Place
You never winnin if youâ€™re jealous of
Another nigga donâ€™t be jealous of how well he does
Just focus on your own team and they can help you up
Iâ€™m young and rich a bunch of bitches blow the celly up
And I canâ€™t even blame em
Send me naked pictures I'mma frame em on the iPhone
Iâ€™m rolling up a Instagram: that's a gram in one blunt
Twenty for the point 5
Its like a brown bag lunch higher than the top bunk
I'd still pop Rihanna I cannot front
Barbequing putting vodka in the fruit punch
So you better watch her or she mine man
Ain't no ring on her finger like LeBron hand

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Curren$y]
Rolling up piles of them sky miles
Coolin in the honey cut
Listening to some Miles Davis â€“ yeah Iâ€™m rich
But Iâ€™m still using my Playstation for a DVD player
Never gave up motherfuck
Not in the business of saving sluts
Theres a auction on some retail space
So Iâ€™m saving up and they sayin Iâ€™m a made man but I ainâ€™t made enough
No baker though iâ€™m cakin up
Take the game and told my niggas take their cut

See : http://rap.genius.com/Master-p-20-on-cars-26-on-trucks-lyrics[Verse 1]
Bitch cold, I swear Dairy Queen rolled up
Very clean, Spur flew over
She got caught up in them wings, we gon' turn a couple corners
Talk about of couple things, preliminaries went great
Iâ€™ma let you hit this weed, once we on that interstate
I donâ€™t be smoking on them streets
Them traffic lights will have you in a jam with the man
I ainâ€™t spending n'an minute
In the can of sky mall, tryna spend a hunnit grand
I know how to show you how we can get it spend it again
Gone in the wind, gone with the ones who win
Them boys is grown men, boss shit is what Iâ€™m spitting
So boss shit is what you getting when you make a decision to listen
I see them niggas figging, cause Iâ€™m high Iâ€™m slipping
They gon' knock me off position, but why
Cause a nigga be riding nice cars, fancy clothes
Naked hoes, and mansion homes
Got a lot but still we want more
Cause one thing you can never have is
Too much money, too much money, too much money
You can never have too much money, too much money, too muchIn the studio I read a magazine
They had a column in there asking people
If they had 3 wishes
What would they wish for?
So I figured I'd ask myself..
So if I had 3 wishes
This right here would be my first:

I wish I could bomb drop from the top of the Superdome
On my skateboard, head up Claiborne!
Ollie over curbs in the 3rd Ward
And then shook through the Calliope
Holla at tough guy Dodo
Let him bang my brand new album
In his Range Rov
Puff a couple L's with him
Go home and change clothes
Aqua green Polo, with matching Bally
Animals. And then it's on to Gentilly
To holla at my nigga Soulja Slim
From the CutThroat Committee
Split up a Philly, fill it with sticky
And talk about all the hoes we fucked
In out city. Give him dap and a hug
Then I gotta get going, St. Bernard
I holla at my homey Ace
Let him see my new whip, ride out
To the IHOP in the east and get a
Bowl of cheese grits..

That's what I wish for
See, the 3 people I was talking about
They're not alive no more
East is a part of New Orleans
Destroyed by Hurricane Katrina
Here's my 2nd wish:

[Verse 2]
I just wish my nigga Wayne
Would get the respect that he deserves
In this fuckin game, he's the illest
With these words, I know I might've said
That shit before, but I'm just making sure
It's heard! And that my nigga Maine would
Have the same success that I have
Cause I'm oh-so blessed, yes
And for my nigga Dizzy, 10 million
Platinum plaque, cause you work hard
Homeboy, you deserve that
And then we'd have a spliff
Won't crumble to pieces like them other
Real cliques. And we all get rich
Then we all have kids
They they all get rich, then they
All have kids. Then they all get rich
Then they have some more kids..
Then they all stay rich and
Those kids have more kids
And they all get rich, then those kids
Have kids and they all get rich.. alright, alright

I know that was a big wish..
But I have a lot of people
That I wanna thank, I feel like they
Deserve that.. now it's time for the 3rd wish:

[Verse 3]
I just wish that my ex girl would've never
Fucked with one of my homies
Cause it took a toll on me
Now I give a fuck about a bitch cause
I feel like everyone is a phoney
I'll never love again, move another bitch in
Let her live in my crib, give her keys
To my whip, shit.. she ruined that
For all these hoes - now it's YMOB
You know what I do
Young Money Over Bitches, I don't
Give em tongue kisses, I just
Hit em with that dick and have em
Pose for naked pictures
And show em to my niggas, and then
I gotta flip em, let everybody get a piece
And after that I send em
Back to where they living, but with her
I was different. Word on the street was
She was wyling out pretending not to hear it
Girl, you had a good nigga. Oh no, I wasn't
Perfect, but I had a good spirit
That's the last of my wishes..

That's a surprise to a lot of y'all huh?
More than cars and skateboards and weed
I did graduate nigga![Verse 1: Curren$y]
442, 442
I'm burnin' gas like a 442
I'm rollin' past that BMW
That new shit pretty, these old-schools move
I ride city-to-city, my motor fine-tuned
I've got your girl with me, she so unfollowed you
I'm a paper on paper mission, caper to count the loot
We super fly fishin' with Yachts and Gucci shoes
Started with no pot to piss in, now I smoke pot and kick it
Beautiful stranger bitches trying to get more familiar
New Orleans know I feel 'em, wherever I go, I bring 'em
Real niggas in the building, smoked out any whip I've driven
Only focus is gettin' in the door, so we ripped it
Up off the fuckin' hinges like: "Where's the dope? We know it's in here"
Hoes already told us, give it here
Fuck them, we ball, so high, on this motherfuckin' jet
Check my rhymes, I ainâ€™t told a lie yet, nigga

[Hook: Curren$y]
442, 442
I'm burnin' gas like a 442
We comin' through, convertibles and coupes
My OG told me, "Smash anything in front you"
442, 442
I'm burnin' gas like a 442
Convertibles and coupes
If it's 'bout that cash, there's no tellin' what we'll do

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Money to the ceiling
Pimpin' is a gift I opened way too early
Like my hoes hair curly, redbone curvy
Make 'em run from this dick Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Alright, lipstick on my boxers, these pills fuck up my posture
Quick frankly I'm Sinatra, I'm shark and you tilapia
I've got shooters on payroll, but I grab my binoculars
I'm lookin' for my reason to tell my shooters I don't need 'em
Alright, revenge taste better than pussy
Man, ain't got no purple, gotta get it from Whoopi
I'mma put it in your mouth, I don't know how else to put it
I bet they ain't fuckin' with me, where's the bookie
Alright, I'm a motherfucker, quote-un-quote
She ride this dick like it came off the showroom floor
Lil' Tunechi aka No Baking Soda, I'm high, Lamar Odom
I'm smokin' like a motor

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Birdman]
We poppin' off
We get to stuntin', you know it's bang or ball
Rollin' off, slidin' free shopping spree we clear them streets
Third wall, we bend them niggas
Reppin' mines to the end, my nigga
High life, we can't fake [?] so we'll show them niggas
Take they bitches, bring 'em home
Stunna holla, bang and ball
Layin' low in my old school
Top back for my old cool
Gave them niggas fresh game stay fly in that Bentley Coupe
Told my bitch how to get this money
Showed a bitch how to get this money
Pimpin' hoes, we pimp this game
Got the money, we kept on runnin'
Hard top and that new school
Drop top and that new school
Roof wide open nigga out the pound with them big tools
What up five? We in this jungle
What up five? We keep it bumpin'
What up five? We shine and hustle
What up five? Bugh

[Hook][Verse 1: Curren$y]
Now some of these niggas is so deceptive
Usin' my style, pimpin' you foul
Want to be the top gun son, though Spitta don't have a child
'96 Impala digit dash read a hundred miles and
Runnin' straight rhyme, butta layin' the lace
Sweet revenge, funnel cakes, watch the bulls and pony race
Lamborghini Ferrari shoot-out, at the grand prix
V-12 screamin' like a banshee
Pokemon, try to catch 'em all before them hoes get out the parking lot
Bitches who tryna to move up, be quick to choose us
Shorty say she dig my music, but sometimes I lose her
Open up her mind, pass that rapper weed over to her
Free game, you should sponge it up mama, loofah
Loser, used her, sent her back to you a lil' bit looser
Roofless, coupes is, vicious, shit rootless
Two triple black C5s, double homicide

[Hook: Curren$y] (X1)
Jet life to the next life, alright
And onto H-Town, ride and smoke all night
Igloo fool, keep it cool, on ice
Jet life to the next life, alirght

[Verse 2: Killa Kyleon]
Ridin' first class, Killa
Cut the check, hand me my boardin' pass
They look up to the Jets
We lookin' down at them unloaded ass
Walk it, like I talk, like I bought it outta politics
Benjamin, Jackson, Hamilton - bitch I'm into politics
Republicancs and Democrats, but sorry I'm not into that
Direct me to them paper planes, now where them pretty women at
White cups, got 'em double stacked, my SS like a hovercraft
Soarin' through them kush clouds, yeah that's where I hover at
I'm lovin' that, Jet life to the next life
I elope with that money, broke is my ex-wife
Killa split her, pass her like a doobie, and let Spitta hit her
Killa splitter, I can even get her if her nigga with her (haha)
Pimpin' on my priest shit, Dynamite Willie
Heart cold when it comes to TLC, I'm chilli
Lookin' for a sucka? well, you got the wrong rapper
That ain't my lifestyle, you took off the wrong wrapper
I'm a Magnum!

[Hook: Curren$y] (X1)[Verse 1: Big Sean]
OK, I'm smoking loudly, I woke them all
I pick up that tree, when it's not fall
I'm gone off that tree, when it's not tall
I'm in love with tree, I'm an avatar
I pick up a O from, my nigga Ralphy
My bro and me, but he is not alphy
Gone off that goo punch, it makes me drowsy
Roll up the windows, it makes it cloudy, Damn, if you ain't know
I made these girl night, smoke a paper and bowls
My ladies like blunts, hit 'em twice if not once
Then I blow 'em off and just pass 'em to my bro
Now catch you getting brain if a nigga not learning
I be spending money if a nigga not earning
Catch me in the backseat if I'm not stirring
And I be rolling up if a nigga not burning, boy

[Hook:]
I got five on it
Have your bowl and get beat
I got five on it
Nothing with that endo weed
I got five on it
If you got me stuck and not go back
I got five on it
Now let's go hop outside

[Verse 2: Chip Tha Ripper:]
You know a nigga like to stay at that cruising altitude up in the sky
Try to fuck with paper planes but it's not the same high
Cleveland niggas ain't no bitches we prefer the cigarillo smoke
If you say it take away from taste then get some better smoke
Cause this shit I blow can get smelt on the next block
Ain't no middle mans every thing you need is in stock
This Glock is all the security I need
I be solo dolo, when you see me blowing on some weed
Why speed, no need, I be just taking it slow
I be so clean, diesel over powers my cologne
Now all the bad bitches who blazed on shifting this way
Y'all just some white belts, with leaves I am the sensai
Now bow to the bag never, save the best for last
When I come around niggas know to hurry up and pass
Fuck a dime sack, let's cop a quarter pound now
What the fuck is you gon' put down?
Nigga I got five

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Curren$y]
How wired, 6-4 hydraulics
Not stolen, lost my keys, I was high partna'
Fuck you want? This the raw paper not a blunt
You must, got me mixed up with Chip cause, This Spitta
Zig zag a whole zip up, shit strong shoulda' came with a bed pick up
Bitches calling me, wanna smoke beggin' for me to pick up
She blow me while I'm blowin' rings of that killa'
That weed you smoking brown, fake weed to much make up, clown
Get real smoking green, strawberry fields
High standing up feelin' like I'm layin' down, couple bugie Judy's came round
Actin' all stuck up, now they just stuck from smokin' with us
Had the hallway smellin', Is my windows opening enough?
I hear walkie talkies, Is security coming up?
Fuck

[Hook][Intro]
It's all good, it's already
Yeah, already understood, ain't nothin
Still the same old, that's all
Ain't nothin change, fool, yeah

[Verse 1]
Uhh, nigga for what
Get down with these suckers when I'm high as fuck
And they under us, catch a crook in ya neck
From trying to watch the jets, Mr. Tokyo Drift
Spent yen on a vet, lookin' for ya bitch fool
Take one guess she caught up in the rapture
Wakin and bakin Anitaâ€™s greatest hits blastin
Pedal mashin, paper twistin'
Scrape an engine, Rad Racer
No 3D glasses just a high ass rapper, Spitta
Nigga in the building, nah I'm on the roof chillin'
The pool up here, couple chicks I grew up with
Bottles in the cooler
If ya don't know how to do it homie I'll school ya
Barrel roll, loop de loop, top gun manuevers
Makin hot wheels outta hoopties holdin it down like balloon strings

[Hook]
It's all good ain't gotta be said, it's already understood
Ain't nothin, ain't nothin' change but the address
Fool, ain't nothin' change but the address
We still the same mode niggas switchin the script
But we still playin' the same role, and so
Ain't nothin' changed but the address fool, ain't nothin change

[Verse 2: Stalley]
Starin out the villa at the ocean miles long
Tryin' to figure out raps to put up in a song
Nights long but the day's short, Nike shorts
Argyle socks, Jordan three's, lounge gear
Long beard you can tell I ain't from round here
Obvious with the occasional glare from the natives
Call 'em back tell my mama I make it
Not complacent with the life style
Feels good but it's hard to crack a smile
When the ones you came up with not around
Roll a joint after pickin through the pound, whole perception done changed
Funny how a three hour flight can make ya life change
Tight things I be thinkin on
When I'm driftin in and out of herb clouds
Hangin on every second of the moment
So you can feel all the memories I come home with
And for those that miss me, I'll be back don't trip in the 'Maro with the shift kit
Ocean side, doors open wide tryin' not to be sea sick
Plottin in the tropics thinkin' how I'm gone run this
Back in the states when I leave

Real nigga, let me make it as clear as my windows
No square shall enter in the circle of winners
Know Iâ€™m prepared for whatever, if you know what I been through
Rearview, Clear vision, memories of paid dues
Confined to a runway, thunderstorms came thru
But look what it came to, something that amazes you
Soon as you quit hating and hear what I gotta say to you
Baby blue sole. These white 11, â€™96
No retro card came with this
Same year, my Impala with the floor shift
4-door suicide, Muscle car chauffeured
Shawty body choco-latte; Russell Stovers
Brung weed with her whenever I invite her over
Polo sweater, Teddy bear hanging off her shoulder
No care, over here, so we put it in the air
Walking â€™round my house, say she wanna fuck everywhere
Thatâ€™s cool baby, but I just got that pool table
We ainâ€™t gotta stay away from it, Itâ€™s all good
If you wanna get under it, then I guess I can fuck with it
Before I got on this beat, it made out a bucket-list
In these bars, I granted its deathwish
Legendary lay-up. Jordan with the right-left switch
Hang time, Hand glide, Stir fried, Chanky-eyed, Shanghai
Candy rain, drizzle frame, I ride
â€™87 Corvette ZR1, took the T-tops off it
Put â€˜em in the trunk bitch, all gassed up, she been drinkinâ€™ from the pump
Thatâ€™s all bad, tryna pass, fucked around and crashed
Bitches all flip, Fools tryna make it last
Emotional luggage, nothing of it, I donâ€™t check bags
I just carry-on, leave that bullshit in the past
Half Rose, Chandon, OJ in my glass
Mimosa, Testarossa program, Countach curriculum
Doors open like a pendulum swinging
Rock in my Jetset Emblem
Foolish to serve like Wimbledon, Interior cinnamon
The car that Iâ€™m sittinâ€™ in, Calm my bad nerves, I call her my Ritalin
Just kiddin, not pillinâ€™, just element twistinâ€™
From the Earth come the fire and the wind Iâ€™m livin
Not pillinâ€™, just element twistinâ€™
From the Earth come the fire and the wind Iâ€™m livin
From the Earth come the fire and the wind Iâ€™m livin
Yeauhh[Talking:]
Shoutout to Fam-Lay
Ugh

When you think of boss niggas think of me
Cause if there's a stressin ain't no question at his side (spitta)
Altough I conceal my identity
Beneath the Louie V. scarf, niggas only see my eyes
They know that nigga stuntin
He be gettin money
They know that nigga ballin
The hoes he all fuckin
They know that nigga famous
They know that nigga blingin
And they know the niggas I be with is too dangerous (fly society)
Ughhhh

[Verse 1:]
Nigga skip all the bull shit
Red and black jordan number 1's, I'm on my bulls shit
Hustle like grocery carts, you push it
Nigga spend good money on it if it's good shit
I'm on the set with young roddy on this hood shit
Chillin like a villain, hope the popo don't ruin it
Chicks dig what I spit, tell me to keep doin it
Chicks whipped by the dick, want me to keep doin it
Can't get what I get, I cop kicks numerous
Limited editions, spitta shop for exclusiveness
Fuck fuckin with fuck boys and they fuckin foolishness
Got ya homies watchin ya back like a big booty bitch
Cause ya can't maneuver the mat without losin it
Jack boys screamin on ya, makin ya move ya shit
I might see two, but they don't reach in my cooler slick
Try to catch a cold, ya catch an uzi clip
Yeaah!

Spitter, spitta

[Verse 2:]
The band on my watch is ceramic
Bezzle got the same rocks that dropped the titanic
People talk about him, word of mouth is gigantic
Rappers gettin worried, they just startin to panic
Hope ya didn't blow ya advance, you better manage
The few cents you got left, cause that's ya last chips
Hot spitta no longer next, I am the present
Ya girl ask santa for me, cause I'm her present
Telescope on the balcony, watching the planets
Telephone ringin, I'm too high to answer it
Tell my homie bring me a pack of them ziz zags'
Gonna be a high time like the fuckin magazine
If ya song wack, I'll heal the cut, I'm bandaged
Cluckers say one time, and the dope boys vanished
Like the joint I'm smokin right now, after the last hit
I'm toasted like a quiznos sandwich
Spitta

Never stop, 'til we pick up loot on every block
The roof on the crib got that helicop
Coupe move with new shoes and socks
Not to mention the masterpiece watch
Not to mention the chain or the diamond rings
Material things, wasteful, I know
But I just use it as a way to keep scope

[Verse 1: Curren$y]

Shit bigger than a 6 plus, this is us
The crew who you hide your bitches from
Jet Life homie, you trying to get rich or what?
Closed this deal in a restaurant, power lunch
I had the veal with the parmesan
Bed of angel hair pasta it was resting on
Two mimosaâ€™s, a to-go cup with Coca-Cola
Now I'm smokin', rollin', gas in my motor, sippin' my soda
We use the Pro Tools to break down boulders
My girl pull her own weight, with her sexy lil shoulders
In the strapless Vera Wang, Alexander or whoever made it
I just know she paid it, it cost me Nathan
Sexy, cool, crazy
My baby like one of them hot 70â€™s ladies
Under disco lights with her hips swaying
To the music playin'
While I'm making major moves with the boss playas
Win or lose I was there, beginning to end
I paid dues so I'm included and you never knew it
Until you saw we did it you was still tryna do it
Lookin' at us lookin' like stars, and we lookin' at you stupid
Sucks to be you kid
Drugs
In the music

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Boss playa I'll ask what it cost later
Throw it in the cut like fuck it Iâ€™ll floss later
In the mix like a cross fader
No DJ, givin' em' no leeway
We be everywhere from the mansion to the PJ's
Crown on the wrist, pound of the piff
Get around in the 6, ask in town I'm the shit
But whoâ€™s the niggas Iâ€™m shittin' on?
Come to money, you gettin' off or gettin' on?
You see that fly shit Spitta on
You see that fly shit Ghost on
The money and the weed, the guns and the Nikes
In the cars with the ice just might form Voltron
Or should I transform on 'em, they was goin ham on 'em
I was blowin' grams on 'em
They was showin' swag
I was blowin' bags full of strains that niggas didn't ever know they had
It's Jet Life, I except life
Itâ€™s knot life until you come through livin' block life
Carbon fiber stock pipes
Iâ€™m talkin' marble on the kitchen counter
You gon' smell like reserve if you sit around us
Should I keep goin' or quiet up?
If you got fire, then fire it up

[Hook][Prod. by Purrpdogg]

[Bridge: Curren$y]
Outside leanin' on the homie's cutlass
Burning a lil somethin'
Talking bout a lil somethin'
Finna come up big on 'em

[Hook]
Lil somethin', talking 'bout a lil somethin'
But we finna' come up big on 'em
Lil somethin', talking 'bout a lil somethin'
But we finna' come up big on em
Lil somethin', talking 'bout a lil somethin'
But we finna' come up
Lil somethin', talking 'bout a lil somethin'
But we finna' come up

[Verse 1]
I got dope in my rhymes I sell dope
Get in my car ride around turn heads everywhere I go
Smellin' like a whole pound thats just a roach
She wanna sit in my glass house and roll up the smoke
I get around the building "quit rolling stoned"
I got your girl at my smash spot but not at my home
I smarter than that, baby I'm too cold
I could sell a Polar bear a coat
'96 Impala like a boat
Fill out that motherfucker float
Them bitches say I do the most
But I know I can always do more

[Bridge + Hook]

[Verse 2]
Me and my niggas took an oath
Never again being broke
I get it crackin' like jokes
My cousin 'lac on spokes
Daytons and Zeniths thatâ€™s how we roll
Daily I'm living by the code
My brother snuck in the back door, something serious
God forbid he let it go, while we in here
Every day and they didn't know that's how it's been
Since I was nothing years old I remember
When the G's spoke I was all ears
Now I'm draped in all gold when they see me


[Bridge + Hook]

[Bridge](Chorus)
You make me feel alive
You are my high desire
You make me feel alive
You are my high desire

[Verse 1 Celeb Forever]
Yeah, okay
Welcome to the side where the grass is always greener
And the women always naked
I swear life is what you make it
Niggas be making plans, Tony Tiger Frosted Flakin'
Man I'm moving in the game
Man the money is adjacent
Smokin' on good, artificial flavoring
AK 47, new gun fragrance
I'm on it, if you with it
She driving, I'm twisting
Aston Martin double-park it that a cop give me a ticket
Niggas is feeling froggy, kill you over a ribbit
I chop a nigga in half so technically he a midget
Never that Reggie Miller, got trees like it's Christmas
Watch: yellow diamonds, he's like a Simpson
Pull out my thing, let her teethe like an infant
We don't smoke the same, Boy my G's too expensive
I tell her puff puff
I fuck a chick laying down, trying to cum up
Hoes down, blunts up, man

(Chorus)
You make me feel alive (put ya, put ya, man, uh, now put ya)
You are my high desire (now put ya, now put ya lighters up, now put ya, now put ya, now put ya lighters up)
You make me feel alive (put ya lighters up, put ya lighters up, put ya, yeah, gone)
You are my high desire (put ya lighters up, yeah)

[Verse 2 Curren$y]
By the strength of the quality weed smell
You can tell that I'm somewhere in the buliding on my Batman shit
Nigga suspended from the ceiling
Not really, but that's the way the weed got me feeling
Gondola rides in Venice
Mama you got the vision and see it HD and it couldn't be any clearer
You should be with Spitta and you know it, it's your chance
Don't blow it like birthday candles
Good guy, Spitta, keep his name out of them scandals
Now the secret: I prefer my girl in sneakers, never sandals
Posing naked in only a pair of Nike Vandals
Bottles pop, back to back, extra large chronic sack, cell phone camera snaps
Mama I remember that, anytime I look at that
I go to wondering where you at
So baby where you at wit it?
I'm just tryna hit it on the friendly
And maybe if we get back up in a minute (yeauh)

(now put ya lighters up, put ya, yeah, put ya lighters up... ay pass me that blunt right there.)

(Chorus x2)
You make me feel alive (uh, now put ya)
You are my high desire (put ya lighters up, put ya lighters up)
You make me feel alive
You are my high desire
You make me feel alive (I swear they don't be smokin' like us man)
You are my high desire (and I don't even used to do this shit but...)
You make me feel alive
You are my high desire
