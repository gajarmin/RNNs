[Intro: Future]
We the motherfuckin best nigga
Ace Hood
Super, Future

[Hook: Future]
I come looking for you with Haitians

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
Niggas be hatin I'm rich as a bitch
100K I spent that on my wrist
200 dollars, I spent that on your bitch
Do me a model, put that on my list
Oh there he go in that foreign again
Killin the scene bring the coroner in
Murder she wrote, swallow or choke
Hit her and go home, I won't call her again
Woke up early morning, crib as big as a college
Smoke me a pound of the loudest
Whippin some shit with no mileage
Diamonds cost me a fortune
Them horses all in them Porsches
You pussies can't hardly afford it
4,200 my mortgage
Ballin on niggas like Kobe
Fuck all you haters you bore me
Only the real get a piece of the plate
Reppin my city I'm runnin my state
Give me a pistol then run with the K's
Niggas want beef then I visit ya place (Bang!)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
Yeah, and I'm at it again
There go that flow bringin tragedy in
Copped me a chain your salary spent
Niggas is sweet bring them cavities in
Countin money, hourly trend
Rolling them skinny like Olsen twins
Niggas is squares, coppin' a Benz
Neck full of Gold Olympian shit
Neimans, I'm blowing the check on they gear
Fall on some pussy then hop on the Lear
Strapped with them choppers back of the rear
Sak pase' them killers is here
Woke up early this morning, mind is tellin me money
Paper, mula, pockets is fat as a tumor
Millionaire nigga no rumor
Livin my life off of tuna
Wanted with me I deliver the beef
Real niggas only enjoyin the feast
Pull up a seat, bon appétit
No Louboutins put that red on your sneaks (Bang!)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Photographs of dope boys, is all they taking
Finger prints on the Rolls Royce, is why they hatin'
Push a button on these broke boys, that's detonation
Walk a road to riches bare feet
I watch mama struggle now she livin' carefree
That's why I hustle for half a key that's 12 G's
I'm tryin' to bubble every summer a new LP
You gotta love me I got shooters out the D-League
Signin' bonus hit that man that's from thirty feet
Left in a puddle, finger prints is on hundred mill
And what it is?
Ricky Rozay and Ace Hood, we hella Trill
Yeah

[Hook][Intro]
I've been gettin' money for a minute
Askin' me a lot where I been
But I been gettin' money for a minute

[Pre-Hook]
Uh, see, I been gettin' money for a minute
Rain, sleet or snow, I go and get it
Uh, see, I been gettin' money for a minute
And they ain't got to talk it, boy, I live it

And now I'm gettin' money like never before
They don't want to see me ball out of control
Married to the money, I had to propose
Niggas, they ain't know me, expect me to fold

[Hook]
But I been gettin' money, uh, see, I been gettin' money
Uh, see, I been gettin' money
See, cause I've been gettin' money
Tell me, tell me where you been, nigga

[Verse 1]
Work out a pulse at the corner store, still got my jewelry on
They got that okey-doke, move that dope out to Mexico
Young nigga tweakin', young nigga tweakin'
Hit after hit, but tell me why these niggas sleepin'
So where you been? I been gettin' money
I been fuckin' bitches, rollin' Swishers, gettin' blunted
Please don't make me pull out the coupe
And go 'head and pull out the Chevy
Sixty bands on the bezel, I made a mil' out the settee
I did a lot for you niggas, who the fuck told you to hustle hard?
Uh, who the fuck gave you 'Bugatti', nigga?
Uh, hottest flow, I'm not bein' modest, nigga, no
Ask a nigga where he been, I been gettin' money
And ever since I got it, niggas, they been actin' funny
But I ain't even trippin', no, I ain't even trippin'
And I just bought a Roley, dog, and I can't waste a minute, no

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Okay, you broke niggas counterfeit and we just the opposite
I'm way overconfident, all these cheques I'm depositin'
Made a young nigga greedy, young nigga greedy
I bought the world and everything in it, I'm needy
Now, where you been? I've been in the gym
I done got my weight up just in case they do a tenth
Please don't think it's sweet like some sugar
I put that boy undercover
He woke up in a hospital, heard the voice of his mother
I tried to tell him, but they ain't listen
I'm in that Bobby, Johnny Gill, that new edition
Countin' up dollar after dollar, so repetitious
This bitch I'm wit', her head so good, I paid her whole tuition
I'm trippin', askin' where I been, I been gettin' money
And ever since I got it, niggas, they been actin' funny
But I ain't even trippin', no, I ain't even trippin'
I just left overseas and made another half-a-million, nigga

You can't sit with us, you can't hit the blunt
Just to tell the truth, we don't fuck with you

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
We don't fuck with you, we don't fuck with you
I can smell that fake from like a mile or two

Standin' on your sofa, nigga, fuck your couch
Niggas like some bitches, they just run their mouth
Askin' all them questions, boy your mind gone
Boy you must be workin' for the 5-0

Cross my heart and hope to die

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
I love my alphabets, all I smoke is Ls
Yeah, C+ is the police, I don't fuck with 12s
I spent too much money on the package for the scale
I need my money up front cause I don't trust the mail
I'm gon' rip this beat apart if the bass good
My block is like a deck of cards, Ace Hood
I wanna know just who you are and if you taste good
I can go anywhere I want because my face good (A1)
Got this lil' bitch I jump up on like a skateboard (kick, push)
Every time that I need some money, I take some
She'll suck my dick and go and kiss her nigga
Stop it, my Pan 4-door, fuck you, hit my middle finger

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ace Hood]
Just know my circle small and I don't trust nobody
We gon' have to weigh that money, too much profit pilin'
I just love to stunt on all my old hoes
I do not fuck with that bitch, she cannot keep her legs closed
I'm runnin' the game, I'm fuckin' them lames
Forrealla, forreal, that head was insane
But all of these niggas be frontin'
All of my niggas be stuntin'
Livin' this life and we love it
We gettin' this money, I keep it 100
Say I, don't fuck with these niggas
I say, now I, ain't lovin' these bitches
Cross my heart and hope to die

[Hook][Ace Hood]

Ballin' I blow fifty racks in the VIP

Right, put it in the light
Nigga got ice but it don't look right
If a nigga buy a brick and it don't cook right
I'll whip that shit for a rack, sit tight
I got a bag full of tools and some yay to move
And all I want is money, leave the fame to you
I graduated out of gladiator school
So all I know is go like I'm trained to do
Right now, turn my Mazy pedal to the metal I'm ashin' out
I let the top down in my Phantom drop
Blowin', I'm high as an astronaut
When you see me, I'm cashin' out
Walked into Mercedes bought half the lot
You keep carrying on, you getting carried out
Cause I don’t take ass whoopins, just pass ‘em out
Is this worth getting blasted about?
No forreal, is it worth getting blasted about?

[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]
Money conversation
Get so high, I be scrapin'
Got my eyes like a Asian
In my ride, like I'm racin'
In the sky, like a plane
It's Gang or die
Ain't no lames up in my circle
Ain't no ho shit in my eyes
Throwin' money in the air
Poppin' bands and let it fly
Where I'm from, you come up short
Pull that thing and let it fly
You know me, blow so much dank, think I'm Marley
Got so much ink on my body
Brought so much drink to the party
I fell asleep and woke up in a new Bugatti

[Hook: Future]

[Verse 5: Birdman]

Flow hot as the Mojave, gimme that sloppy shit

If you got good pussy you should always have your rent paid
Choke on some bands if I'm not mistaken
Add up my outfit, fashion statement
This the school of hard knocks, graduation

[Bridge: Future]

[Verse 8: Ace Hood]
I'm sick of y'all niggas all talkin' crazy
Hottest nigga spittin' and they can't debate it
I didn't really know 2Pac or Big
But know the beast within'll reincarnate 'em
Fuck underrated, I'm constipated
I'm shittin' on 'em, fuck toilet paper
You're now tuned into the fuckin' greatest
Ace Hood, congratulations
Say name one nigga that's rockin' with him
Flow like a hundred round choppa nigga
Made a way out of the jungle
And now they in trouble, I used to be humble as shit
Recently flooded my neck and my wrist
Tell all them critics to suck on the dick
Nigga

[Bridge: Future][Intro]
Dear heavenly father
I come to you today
To remove all these evil spirits
Keep us out of harm’s way
Never allow us to die broke

[Verse 1]
I pray for them children who woke up this morning and lost they life
How dare the government passin’ these laws to remove the Christ
As soon as a tragedy happen the person you call is God
Now people obeyin’ and prayin’, they prayin’ I’m sayin’ it’s odd
Fuck the world – the government too
I’m keepin’ it real, them killers are still in political suits
And I hate it, it’s people, it’s nothin’ my brother or sister could do
But sit back and pray as we watchin’ the news and we take the abuse
What train of thought is tellin’ you shoot up a movie theatre?
What kind of fool gon’ walk in a school and off them angels?
It could me my moms, my brother or sister, a friend that I knew
The funny thing is, it could’ve been me, it could’ve been you
I’m tired of people complainin’ about the little shit
When I just lost my grandmother to that cancer bitch
You woke up this morning – why the fuck is you mad?
You broke as a joke – get up off your ass
I hustle like niggas is broke even though I be countin’ the cash
I gotta get it – like I’m down to my last
Put that on my mama, don’t wanna go through them tears again
‘Cause when you are broke, it’s nobody there, including your friends
Lord knows… the realest shit I ever wrote
But through all the bullshit I throw up a sign of hope…
But through all the bullshit I throw up a sign of hope

[Hook]
Fuck the world – the government too
I’m keepin’ it real, them killers are still in political suits
And I hate it, it’s people, it’s nothin’ my brother or sister could do
You can hate it or love it, but youngin’ I’m simply speakin’ the truth

[Verse 2]
I woke up this morning and I got the news that my homie was shot
Out on the block and in front of his daughter, believe it or not
Good people are sayin’ and prayin’ for innocent murders to stop
We livin’ in Hell and it’s easy to tell some people are shocked
Who are you people to judge me ‘cause of the way that I live?
The way that I grind, the things that I did, the person I am
Everyone got opinions but niggas as broke as a joke
I went to them schools and spoke to the children that need it the most
I gave away toys, I gave ‘em a speech, delivered ‘em hope
It’s a blessing to become a blessing, my mama would set it in stone
Fuck these niggas hatin’ on me
Hate is such a weak emotion
And money is the root of evil
But that’s that shit that keeps me focused
Sometimes I still can’t believe I’m a father
No pain can describe on how to reside with losin’ a daughter
Fuck this world – the ignorance too
They want me to fall, but still I continue to lace up this shoe
Society’s being misleaded, I’m simply giving you proof
Them people is sellin’ these lies, I’m simply speakin’ the truth
Lord knows… the realest shit I ever wrote
But through all the bullshit I throw up a sign of hope…
But through all the bullshit I throw up a sign of hope

[Hook][Intro: Usher] (DJ Khaled)
I'll hold you remix (this the remix)
I'll hold you remix
You are, you are
Be sure you got a rider beside you to hold you down

[Verse 1: Usher]
I'll hold you down, I'm on my way
My mama told me (you are) make sure you got a rider beside you
Even if you ain't have all the money, fame and the power
So I found her, fly shit, I jump up out her
I pick her low valley, she rock with me, it don't matter

[Hook: Usher]
There goes my baby
Together we're better, you're a breath of fresh air
Hold this ready and I'm round
You hold me down, I'mma hold you down
Now

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I'mma get money, nigga, smell it on my gear
Black bottle, boy, baller hood billionaire
Boots in the mud, now it's marble floors
Staircases to the roof look like it's heaven's door
Said a prayer for my woes who be dead and gone
How could I let you down if you never hit the phone?
Then they gave him all his money, make you go insane
We fucked the game, she said she knew that I would never change
Trap star, two bricks in the match box
Gold D's, fat boy, peanut butter top
I wanna spend a night with Jessica White
But is a dopeboy really Jessica type?

[Hook]

[Bridge: Usher]
[I'll hold you remix (I'll hold you, I'll hold you)
I'll hold you remix now
I'm on my way to hold you down]

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
(We the best
Yeah, we the best at holding it down)
She said he don't hold her down right
Some day she'll be done with him
I say there's 7 days in the week, some day ain't one of them
You gotta know your worth, baby, don't give 'em no discount
All of mine are dime, you see a nine, it was a miscount
And I'm the one to tell a bitch to bounce
I'm the one who getting this amount
I'm the one with this foreign shit
Name still getting mispronounced
Hold up, who you held down? When you ever put bail down?
I'mma keep picking money up like the motherfucker fell down
It's an us versus y'all thing, we a small gang
Just the two of us, baby, but we all bang
Bang, bang, bang like what set you claim
And when they asked me that, baby, you know I said your name

[Hook] + [Bridge]

[Verse 4: Ace Hood]
Keys to the whip, key to the mansion
I fuck you while counting money, I'm just that romantic
See we be Bonnie and Clyde and I keep that heat like Adonis
And if it ever go down I know you won't snitch to your honor
That's why you draped in designer, Chanel and all kind of shit
She with the realest and all 'em lames are too counterfeit
It's been a long time and she's still holding me down
(This the remix)
Nevermind the hoes I've been fucking with that's out of town (let's ride)
I done been through hell, had ups and downs
But in the long run still here
I apologize for when I be talking that freak shit in the air
She still moaning, I know you want it, I go to switching that gear
On everything, she never changed for real
That's why

[Hook](Ace Hood)
Your are now in tune to the beast mix
I got the key to win and i'm the locksmith
You can say your prayers once the Glock lift
Sleeping' on me Freddie Kruger i'm a nightmare
Fuck all this ace hood you need to chill shit
I body these rappers i got the kill switch
I'm the one get it done and i'm like the SEAL six
Police asking me questions i keep a sealed lip
Oh lord i am the illest you gotta' deal with
She blew my brains out she a real crip
Twelve-hollow rounds in the Glock clip
That shit can get to banging if you set trip
Better watch your Mrs. ima shop lift
Go to slamming in this pussy like a mosh pit
Money and power my nigga this is our year
Just know they not on the block if they know the cops there
Damn right hunnit-twenty on the turnpike
Nothing like some head at the red light
She can't get enough, this dick a crack pipe
Let me fuck her to Machiavelli, that's thug life!
Switch the flow up, nigga focused and i'm on that potion
It's hocus pocus, top will disappear  you ain't notice
All you niggas bogus, in the beamer picture me rolling
An i'm heavy boastin', fuck your favorite bitch i'm the chosen
Chevy candy coated, i'm the boss i can't get promoted
I got plenty shooters, but you know i just gotta tote it
If its murder homie, then its guaranteed that i wrote it
If its hot i'm on it, get the bussin like i was tony
I'm talking Montana, pretty bitches in my cabana
Fuck your propaganda, richest nigga with bad grammar
Glocks in them dirty hampers, the clip is like a banana
We the best on my back, can you kindly show me some manners?
Nigga hood nation, fuck waiting and fuck patience
Imma get it now, anybody get traumatized
With that drama time, i'm the one who you idolize
I ain't never lie, gotta ride, they petrified
Hope i never die!
Pussy niggas they ever, try get them televised
Singing more than a lullaby
I was bored nigga, watch get rich or get into war nigga
I kill shit welcome to the morgue nigga!

Donald Sterling feelings i don't like niggas
Every where i go i got my team with me
Only bad bitches ever seen with me
Niggas jealous and they still living
Before i leave this bitch free Meek Milly![Produced By Sonny Digital]

[Verse 1]
I’m sick of these niggas, I’m tired of these niggas
I do not fuck with a lot of these niggas
Gangster hitters, I be with gorillas
Strapped and they ready, you want it you get it
Please do not play with my paper, you finished
Patience is short but them choppers extended
My youngins they thuggin’, they smoking, they fucking
They still out to get it but facing a sentence
Fuck do you phonies be talking about
You do not know what that drama’s about
Make you a promise, I promise to ride
Streets is a struggle, I’m tryna survive
Look the bitches, the money we getting
Champagne that we sipping and foreigns to drive
I pull up on em and shit on your lawn
On my paper say owner, you know that it’s mine
I’m ready for beef just to capitalize
Rappers are petty, they pussy, vajin
Turn your little block to a vacated sign
They get to shooting like red line
Tony Montana, the crib in Atlanta
Thinking bout copping the Wraith or the Phantom
Jump on the jet in my fucking pajamas
Shout out my niggas 100 forever
All my lil niggas are still on probation
My [?] just caught him a charge, I’m praying he dodge immigration
He say fuck it’s PO and he still on them papers
And he just bought him a chopper, he told me it come with a laser

[Hook]
Shooters, my shooters
Yeah we down to do you
We can make a movie
Shooters, my shooters
Yeah we down to do you
Watch how you maneuver

[Verse 2]
I'm getting tired of tellin' you niggas
Don’t do the zoo, but I know some gorillas
Catch me a body on beats I’m a killer
Flow like a chopper that shot up a villa
Boy don’t forget me, I be with the sinners
I am a vet and you such a beginner
Bitch I run the summers and stunt in the winters
See 90 percent of your shit ain’t remembered
I’m back in this bitch and aim straight at your chest
Kick in the door till I get my respect
Heard the new music, it made me depressed
Free all my niggas that call me collect
We be the business, the lord as my witness
I’m way too committed, no time for them bitches
Shout out Ms. Simmons, you know you can get it
I’m the building, them shooters attending
Like knowledge, we ready for war
Nigga was young when I jumped off the porch
Gave up the tigers and now want the Porsche
Once I got right then my mama divorced
Play with my people, I show no remorse
Throw on my jewelry then show up to court
Crib is so big it look like a resort
Nigga we made it, I’m faded of course
Fuck all these niggas, we fucking they bitch
Hate when they act like they bout it, I guess they just want some attention
Don’t let my humbleness fool you nigga
Call up my niggas to call up they niggas to do you nigga

[Hook]

[Outro]
All of my niggas 100 forever
I'll be that nigga 100 forever
Shout out my bitch is 100 forever
I'll be that nigga 100 forever
Shooters, my shooters
Yeah we down to do you
We can make a movie
I'll be that nigga 100 forever[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
No one on the corner has swagger like this
Cause I'm so incredible they not compatible to me
Eat 'em up like I was cannibal, the cattle to a beast
Graduated from the hunger now it's rappers that I feast
And I'm coming for each and everyone of you that said I couldn't do
Now I'm swergity swagging on you bums doin' this interview
Call it an interlude, talking to you inner fools
Got nominated, I know they hate it, they sick of dude
But if you sick of new, I feed the lamers Theraflu
Get em man and buy a coupe and drop the roof
Adjust the cruise, show them what the swagger do
It's on the highest altitude
They can't fit my sneaker shoes, the best rapper attitude
See the younging in the zone
The beaches, see the features on my faces I can't erase because my swagger so amazing homles
Catch me at the top
I'm throwing Big J and hot metal
Balling like I'm Karl Malone
The next best is on!

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
There's only two men I fear when it comes to a battle:
God and my shadow
Everybody else get a ravelled, tangled, mangled, totally disabled
Hung from a roof watch 'em dangle
Then I make his wife feel the pain too: anal
Juelz Santana, forget those busters
The boy flows harder than Kimbo's punches
You boys betta step aside, before I get at guys
You just bugs I'm spittin' that pesticide
Your not mobsters, wait stop the fake, or get found dead with your head in that pasta plate
Money in the bank I benefit from my benefits
I'm making it while I'm spending it
You go to the Louie store, you go to the Gucci store
You go to the mall spend it all what you do that for
You could buy the rags, you could buy the bags
But there ain't no sign that say they sell swag
But you could watch me and do your best imitation
You need a little time, a little preparation
But sooner or later your gonna have to face it
I like a pent house, your a fixed up basement
As far a chicks go I get it you take it
I give 'em all Franks, they call me Nathan's

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Lyrically it don't matter, up-and-comer or a has be
I'm in your ass B who’s the next Raz-B
Wordplay king I'm not the one to Scrabble with
The rocks got more carats in it than rabbit shit
And after these ill lines, you might see why I need a deal sign
Cause everybody coming in this year is failing
Ask why and they just play Sarah Palin
I'd rather be in Maui para sailing
Cause when you in the lead you don't care who’s trailing
So get your little money you isn’t a threat
When we was making it rain you wasn’t drizzling yet
Right Meech? Death before dishonor
Their swaggers like mine cause I left it on the corner
So fly I gotta shop at the Sky mall
And this summer we getting more drops than eyeballs
Loso!

[Verse 4: Jadakiss]
I told you this once Hip Hop is not dead
Change gon' come, just like Barack said
"Money, Power, Respect" like The Lox said
"You'll be the man of the house", my paps said
Heat the streets up, right quick it's all timing
Gucci everything, Sierra Leone diamonds
You could know so much yet but no nothing
If I don't know nothing else, bet I know hustling
This ain't even a rhyme, it's a controlled substance
Strictly iron swinging, no tussling
I just do business I don't do friends
Brand new M1's and 9mm's
As long as money's involved with it I'm in
You ain't gotta second guess the best, I'm him
I would rap circles around these new urkels
Everything is digital, pills are still purple
So I'm staying in my lane 'til it opens up
I'm like a sponge in the game just soaking up
Before I'm gone I deserve a hit
I know you heard of Kiss
This is the cypher, I murdered it![Intro: Chris Brown]
Welcome to the cypher
Myself, K-mac, Ace Hood, Tyga
It's the cypher, let's go

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
Moment of silence for this beat that I'm about to kill
And all you rappers signed a suicidal deal
No hard feelings pimpin', it's what authentic is
Month old denims thirty grand in the steel
Sleepin' on me I put gas in your Nyquil
Gettin' money while your pockets on the diet pill
Flow knock 'em cold out like Benadryl
Glock cold fourteen, call it Emmett Till
Yea, billionaire it's a state of mind
Thats the rollie on thankful for these good times
Michael Corleone back when he was in his prime
Thats how I'm feelin' while I'm fuckin' my new Spanish dime
Damn, and you can tell I'm on another level
He think he better then I? He get the J letter
Yeah jumped in jack be a trend setter
You lookin' at the best how you doin', it's a pleasure

[Verse 2: Kevin McCall]
I'm at the top like high note
Killin' for survival
Jeffery Dahmer - I'mma slaughter every beat that I'm on
Ya'll was sleepin' on me so I had to turn the lights on
My pockets swollen, I should put some ice on it
Shout to Breezy coulda never did this shit alone
Like potty training, coulda never did this shit alone
If we ain't the best to do this, then this shit was wrong
Sicker than HIV I guess that means I'm full-blown
And of course I'm speaking metaphorically
Livin' Fantastic I wonder if there's Four of me
This is just a sample so if you want more of me
You have to rewind time unless the microphone recordin' me
K-Mac rhymin' on the payback, the truth will set you free so I'mma testify and say that
Ballin' like a preacher catch me rollin' in my Maybach
Shinin' cause I blew myself up, Arab

[Verse 3: Tyga]
Look at me now, my dogs said we gon' be rich one day
But I'm Anfernee, I did things the Hardaway
Easy Bake, fast cake, Rearrange your vertebra
Try like a murder case, you gon' need ice gates
Thin ice, I be icier than a winter lake
Oh you, copied my swag, well you a little late
Prolly make more when I'm gone, Mike J
Smooth Criminal, sweet bass I call it Shawtay
Why you starin' so long, what your eyes gay
Money talk so I just walk and let it translate
You ain't fuckin' with me I don't fornicate
I just let her taste-test than I let my kids chase
Young Money Cash Money dollars, big face
So when you talk new rappers don't compare me
I'mma last king we don't talk rappers if it ain't YMCMB

[Verse 4: Chris Brown]
They said I was down for the count let's make them eat they words
And if it's beef well sweet I make them bite the curb
This probation got me walkin' on the straight and narrow
I'm takin' shots in the club just likes it's double barrel
Come on live through what I been through
This media so fucked up that's why I don't do interviews
And I ain't gotta break shit but I bend the rules
Skateboard kick-flip right in my pool
With two hundred model chicks super gettin' loose
They just wanna big dick did I say that, Opps
Ha, oh my, oh my where's my manners
Pardon me for this grammar, this Virginia country grammar
Going nuts like some Planter's, and my chain feel like an anchor
When I told you to use your head but I ain't want you to be no thinker
Fresher than a mothafucka yeah you got yo stank up
Yeah swallow your pride, yeah go head and drank up[Intro]
R.I.P Whitney Houston
God bless her soul
I’m just vibin’ though
But for you haters

[Hook]
Nothing’s gonna stop me
I swear to god
Nothing’s gonna stop me
Andy, Kiko, Renegades
Nothing’s gonna stop me
Nothing’s gonna stop me

[Verse 1]
Money talks so what’s your conversation?
Counting my blesses, my sweet elaborated
Being broke ain’t a joke, that feeling is devastating
Nightmare so therefore is never stated
Calculating every dollar bill
Reminiscin’ they missin’ like someone without a meal
Still trippin’, this life I’m livin’ the dream still
Look at my niggas loyalty’s mad real
That’s cuz we got this from the bottom up
Remember slidin’ in my homie momma truck
We did what we had to do, we ain’t give a fuck
Now we the niggas winnin’ though, wuddup?
Ain’t it funny how the time fly?
Couple cars and a twenty story high rise
Took a minute but shit connecting like wifi
And fuck you to them niggas who said my career died
Shit, I’m livin’ quite well
On the beach I’m sippin’ wine and cracking lobster tails
With a Spanish mami give me opposite of tails
Ask me do I like it papi I’m like hell yea
We da best the fuckin’ logo
Just hope you get the picture when you take your photos
Own a couple cars but I need one more though
Phantom coming soon, real nigga YOLO
True, I’m just vibin' though

[Hook]
Nothing’s gonna stop me
I tell ‘em: nothing’s gonna stop me
Yea, feel good when you comin’ from nothin’ homie
But I tell ‘er: nothing’s gonna stop me
Swear to god (nothing’s gonna stop me)
Starvation

[Verse 2]
In the studio, watching the Grammy’s homie
Pray today they nominate the one and only
Prolly cry some tears at the ceremony
Only lord knows when they ready for me
Inspiration runnin’ through my blood
Motivated from the fact I made through the mud
Kept my faith although they doubted when I lost my buzz
All over somethin’ that I’m winnin’ ain’t gon show me love
In the street label me underrated
Starving for respect my only ultimatum
They ask me Hood that’s why you goin’ hard
Cuz I just want my mama off that boulevard
I come from a city where there ain’t many stars
And given no pity promised them prison bars
Teachers said I won’t amount a shit
Graduated high-school, college never went
Still I manage them seven figures with common sense
And at the age of 52 my mama finally quit
Fuck it right I never stop
Found a way to motivate them niggas’ blog
Whitney Houston died yesterday
God bless her, hope she end up at them heaven gates
Watching the Grammy’s just as they dedicate
In the mean time, let’s let this marinate
Yea, I’m just vibin’ though

[Outro]
Oh yea (nothing’s gonna stop me)
Ain’t nothin’ gonna stop me man
Nothing’s gonna stop me
R.I.P Trayvon Martin
Justice will be served my brother
But guess what
Nothing’s gonna stop me
Hold ya head man(nothing’s gonna stop me)
God bless
Hood[Verse 1: Vado]
What happened? Who shot? Who buck and who ran off?
These rappers ain’t hot the fuck they got fans for?
I’m back in the spot, with bundles they hand off
Meet me another block askin' what’s the expand cost
It’s a hard job that fell for raw scarf
Left hand steer,Cartier was all polish
Light knit wear, I don’t pitch the hard
Maserati whip, serve bricks to the carwash
Who’s on the menu? Hunned deep at the venue
Hunned keys who I sent to, turn the weed up the mental
Was in a rental, I done turned down in Pennsylvania
Pistol mania, streets official

[Hook: Kevin Cossom & Vado]
2 fingers in the air for the ones before
Middle finger in the air for the ones that hate
Ain’t no more love
Sorry but it’s gotta be this way
Stackin' all day, trappin' all day
Back with more yay, we clappin' your way
I’m a survivor, I’m a rider
Bet you don’t move
When it’s on this side, no
It’s been so long but we finally arrived
We stackin' all day, trappin' all day
Back with more yay, we clappin' your way

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
You’re looking at a new school legend
Gift out of Heaven
Preachin' that real, yeah I'm something like a Reverend
Livin' by the code, bend nor fold
Black man wearin' 100 G's worth of gold
Iced out watches, shirt from Versace
King of the south I am, wuddup Gotti?
Been speak bout it, money no karate
Profit go to flippin' now they think I’m Illuminati
What you came here for? I’m in the Django clothes
Niggas want my life, they wanna take my soul
See I done switched my flow just like I do with my hoes
Now they know I’m the truth but why it took so long?
Know the Maybach comfy and the kush so strong
No my thoughts ain’t right, I can’t do nothing wrong
I’m so gifted, hear my voice and get lifted
Came from the trenches, gun shots to ditches,listen

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Vado]
I’m quick to grab 9’s when a man hate
Been getting bad vibes from they handshakes
I’mma act fly 'til my land day
No need to ask why my nigga man straight
Long line for the dope that’s a fan base
Hog tie with the ropes, what yo fan face?
Mob ties with the coke, make the plan great
4-5 to his throat, where’s the damn safe?
Khaled you know it’s time
When they see me they’ll see Po in his prime
Rich when he was rich, the industry von zip
Gazelles like Dred Scott, Ciele’s my bread copped

[Hook][Intro]
I've been gettin' money for a minute
Askin' me a lot where I been
But I been gettin' money for a minute

[Pre-Hook]
Uh, see, I been gettin' money for a minute
Rain, sleet or snow, I go and get it
Uh, see, I been gettin' money for a minute
And they ain't got to talk it, boy, I live it

And now I'm gettin' money like never before
They don't want to see me ball out of control
Married to the money, I had to propose
Niggas, they ain't know me, expect me to fold

[Hook]
But I been gettin' money, uh, see, I been gettin' money
Uh, see, I been gettin' money
See, cause I've been gettin' money
Tell me, tell me where you been, nigga

[Verse 1]
Work out a pulse at the corner store, still got my jewelry on
They got that okey-doke, move that dope out to Mexico
Young nigga tweakin', young nigga tweakin'
Hit after hit, but tell me why these niggas sleepin'
So where you been? I been gettin' money
I been fuckin' bitches, rollin' Swishers, gettin' blunted
Please don't make me pull out the coupe
And go 'head and pull out the Chevy
Sixty bands on the bezel, I made a mil' out the settee
I did a lot for you niggas, who the fuck told you to hustle hard?
Uh, who the fuck gave you 'Bugatti', nigga?
Uh, hottest flow, I'm not bein' modest, nigga, no
Ask a nigga where he been, I been gettin' money
And ever since I got it, niggas, they been actin' funny
But I ain't even trippin', no, I ain't even trippin'
And I just bought a Roley, dog, and I can't waste a minute, no

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Okay, you broke niggas counterfeit and we just the opposite
I'm way overconfident, all these cheques I'm depositin'
Made a young nigga greedy, young nigga greedy
I bought the world and everything in it, I'm needy
Now, where you been? I've been in the gym
I done got my weight up just in case they do a tenth
Please don't think it's sweet like some sugar
I put that boy undercover
He woke up in a hospital, heard the voice of his mother
I tried to tell him, but they ain't listen
I'm in that Bobby, Johnny Gill, that new edition
Countin' up dollar after dollar, so repetitious
This bitch I'm wit', her head so good, I paid her whole tuition
I'm trippin', askin' where I been, I been gettin' money
And ever since I got it, niggas, they been actin' funny
But I ain't even trippin', no, I ain't even trippin'
I just left overseas and made another half-a-million, nigga

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook][Hook]
Six summers, six summers
Got enough work to ball six summers
Six bitches, six Hummers
Real niggas, all gunners
Six summers, six summers
Couple mill I'm just trying to live mama
Six summers, six summers
Got enough work to ball six summers

[Verse 1]
Young nigga, most wanted
Want him dead, twelve hundred
My youngin's rage a crib just for some lawyer fees
Know nothing bout no lobster, raised on pork and beans
Counting all this money with that chopper close
Every seen a million on your kitchen floor?
Feds taking pictures, think I'm moving dope
Never thought I'd see this shit for twenty four
Ten bitches, all fucking
Mercedes Benz, them six hundreds
Sixes on the Jeep, I name it 'Bron James
Hundred million dollars, that's my mind frame

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I've been broke before, I remember that like yesterday
All this money that I'm counting got my mama straight
Always had that penny grind, I'm talking hard away
Then I lost my nigga ? it took my heart away
That's why I ball on you niggas, that's why I stunt on you bitches
That's why I'm riding that foreign, so you pussies never forget me
And I'm still toting that nina, just pray to god be with me
My car dashing one-eighty, my bitch looking like Kimmy
My shirt label Versace, and king of diamonds tsunami
My sneakers ?, that red under my sneaks
No shoes off in them boxes, no books all in them bags
Don't count money we weigh that, then send it off to that stash, ah

[Hook][Intro: Ace Hood]
I rebuke the devil away from me
No weapon formed against me shall prosper
Pray for me mama
Live, Starvation

[Hook x2: Ace Hood]
If I should die before I wake
I pray and ask the lord for my soul to take
Niggas dyin’ everyday so I keep that Glock on me
I’m just thankful I woke up to see another day, hey-ey-ey

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
Man I’m sick and tired of this bullshit
And I lost my dawg and I felt like this the worst that it could get
Till I lost my daughter, felt like emptyin’ out that full clip
And I put it on mama, fifth with the Hen, I’m just gonna slow sip
Cause I’m way to stressed and again I’m blessed because I’m still here
Lookin’ in that mirror I can see a man with no fear
Oh lord, oh lord this world is hell although we livin’ in it
Gotta keep my bible, why, oh why must I just keep on sinnin'?
Tryin’ to keep it real in a world so fake, now can I get a witness?
Got niggas killing over Jordan’s, gettin' life in prison
I’m tryin’ to tell you man
Watch the ones who you hang around
The enemy approaching any second now

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
Woke up early in the morning, said I gotta get it
Loaded up my pistol, I just pray that all my sins forgiven
And I know I’m livin’ wrong but mama, you just pray for me
Gotta make this money so my family forever eatin'
That Jesus piece around my neck keep the devil away from me
In an old school cutlass keep that problem with me on the seat
Just hope I'm right put the man above before I go to sleep and
Ain't nothing lesser than a G, that’s how they bury me
Have mercy on ‘em
If I should die before I wake
Pour me out some liquor when you’re at the wake
And I’ll be good as long as I know daughter’s straight
Realest shit I ever wrote, this is a hustler's prayer

[Hook x2][Ace Hood]
As I walk through the valley of the Shadow of Death
I tell em 'I should fear no man, so where my enemy at?'
I'm movin' that phantom with cannons, see the curtains is black
I murder you niggas for certain I be in and be back
Like an energizing bunny I keep it goin' in fact
Hop on any track and demolish don't you bother with that
Cause that bitch who bothers meet them hollows, drop the towel
We be poppin' like its bottles, chop you up like a cerrado in fact
I get on any shit and rip it, peep my energy pack
Just name any nigga that want it with me riddle me that?
Riddle me this. If I don't rip it you consider me wack
I'm on top of the fucking game, so ya'll do better than that
But I think they cakin', runnin' late, they takin' bricks
Before you think or ever blink
I'll be off up in your place
Put that heater to your face and tell you 'lead me to the safe'
Don't cooperate that caution tape will cover up your place
This is all bets nigga on that muthafuckin' Ace
That is I, greedy guy, run up in and take your pies
If you niggas wonder why, look into my fuckin' eyes
Never wonder whats in mind
Give you just a bit of time
I am starving you fuck niggas outta your mind
Fuck yo problems
Fuck yo momma
Fuck yo baby momma drama
Fuck yo sister
Fuck yo daughter
When you fuckin' with the devils, we are rebels
Hear the tremble when you walk over them pebbles
Wear them guns like they a medal bitch
I heavy medal, handle-grip, word shop like it's a sander
I'm 100 and loaded like a muthafuckin' Rambo
Make you scramble from this ammo
That I put off in this hammer
Bitch it's hammer time
You asinine, no mastermind
And half the time, I'm over-time
And after mine there will be none
And if there's some they runnin' from me half the time
Yes I am a problem
I be wildin', I be smilin'
While I'm asking for your wallet
What you drivin'? Give me diamonds
Ask your lady she desire me cause I'm fly as any pilot
Quitted college just to follow me to sight see on an island
I am G-U-T-T-A, put this base up in your face
Until you feel the b-b-bass, from this k-k-k-kay
I am runnin' in your place
It is I, yes Ace Mr. H double O-D
Mister get you in your sleep
Mister see me in the streets
Bitch I'mma a mutherfuckin' beast

And if I hear of any beef, and then I wanna little piece
Just let me get a little piece
I walk your block and hit your streets like I'm a mutherfuckin' G
A matter fact I am a G
And you a P-U-S-S-Y
All you niggas said I couldn't and I told you to your eyes
Bitch I'm on some murder mind
And bitch I'm on some other grind
You can't compare me to your kind
Just listen up and wonder why
Yes I am blind to you niggas rappin' with no passion
Can't imagine ever yappin'
I be rappin', spittin' magic, let you have it
Now let me breathe and let me free you some satisfaction

Huuuhhh

Like I told you niggas before, see I be in and be back
I'm like an energizing bunny with no energy pack
Fuck lettin' you niggas go breathe you can swallow the track
Or you can swallow all them hallows that inserted the gat
And see I gave you won't fold now I'm back in your chest
It's all bets on the next nigga show me your best
And next time I come around have that cheque and the cash
Just tell them niggas Khaled they should put it all on your man
Yeah, put it all on your man
October 14th, I'm taking all bets in advance
GUTTAMais qu’ils parlent, médisent et envient, cuisinent du pudding cheese
Donne de l’amour à la street, apprend à jouir vite
On est les meilleurs de ta ville, vu que les critiques dissent
Feu le parcours de ces vies s’chiffre et s’delete vite
What else, Les caméras nous espionnent, moi, je peux sourire, fils
De l’espace à Aspen, en cap et louie jeans !
A part sale quelle money, qui me parle de signe ?
Avatar, quel relief, i’m behind the scène
What else, What else, Dieu sait qui prêche le trouble
J’ai les paumes toujours gelées, let me pray of course
Rien d’vant à part le temps, fait qu’les rumeurs courent
Rien n’change à part mes saisons, cause you Heater Brooke
On ne parle que de « papiers », sous des prières rouges
Vitre opaque, têtes baissées, l’ombre d’un beamer roule
Et quid de mon décès, genre les paris s’ouvrent
Allergique à ces défaites, we so bullet proof[Dizzy]
Am I the fucking shit
Am I just what you need
Am I the inspiration
Am I just here to please
Yeah I am (x8)
Am I the best you know
Am I holding it down
Ain't I solely the only holder of this crown
Yeah I am (x8)

Am I stuck in a rut, no, I am never gutter ball
Flows is prepared until golden like a butter ball
As for being like me, Never find another yall
I am legend, A league that you ain't in at all
Taking this up to new heights I swear
I don’t care if they stare, I kinda like that there
I’m a young debonair pushing a whip visually impaired
Due to all that purple shit we’ve been putting in the air
Am I
Doin it so G, While keeping it low key
I’m so environmental, Saving paper and growing trees
You hear me doing TI saying you don’t know me
Try approaching me for shit bitch
You can blow me
Am I
Too fucking smart
Or just
Somewhat retarded
Either way, Dizzy always gonna finish what he started
That’s why I’m sticking with this, Hate my ambition if you wish
Put your love into what you do, How could you not get rich?

They like oh my god its Dizzy, Got Go Gettas who with me
And ho’s they in abundance, And so we getting busy
Got Grizz up on the tables, Got G up in the booth
Ace Hood pulling up outside new coupe
Got Jay he in my section along with a selection
I ain't talking bout rubbers when I say I got protection
I am, up in the building
I am, the one you feeling
I am, so titillating your girl says I’m fulfilling
Am I, crossing the line
Am I, the one who made it
Am I, sounding so fine
Ain't you, the one who faded
Ain't you, the mother fucker who said I wouldn’t make it
And yet I demonstrated how cities get dominated
Ain't I, the one and only
Ain't I, numero uno
Didn’t I make a come-up while moving weight like a sumo
Ain't you, the one who curious
Ain't you, checking on Dizzy
And I’m, just letting know you’re gonna wanna ride with me

[Ace Hood]
I am my brother’s keeper you people sleeping on me though
Hopping out of that beamer, with blood up under my sneakers
Those are red bottoms don’t do the Prada they’re sick a gonorrhea
Real you know the deal my safe is holding a mil
Still repping the field I hang like Emmett Till
Fuck alotta these hoes, my girl is with me still

You niggas not
Fresh off the block took my advance went and bought a drop
Cuz I’m the shit and you can smell it from a mile away
Bow down mañana paper pounds Benjamin Franks
Gotta get this money, fuck them bitches that just by the way
I’m probably somewhere in your city nigga getting paid
Cuz I am that nigga
I am that boy, Am I fucking your girl
I had no choice, Her head game sick
That pussy so moist, I hit them then I leave
Tell them to send an invoice, yep Hood[Hook: Detail]
Talk to me baby, tell me who I am
Tell my nigga I said what's up, when you get a chance
Tell my bitch I said what's up, when you get a chance
She said when can you do it, we can do it when you can
Girl I'm all about the angels
Come down from heaven, you angel
Pop that pussy every angle
I swear I love my angel, my angel

[Verse 1: Mystikal]
You might not believe me, think that I'm trippin', but nigga I saw angel
I did, I did, that chick was thick, I mean she was off the chain
I wasn't stalkin' but couldn't stop lookin', like she called my name
Maybe if I get her attention she might notice I'm fly like I'm off the plane
I'm making my move, you know what I mean
It ought be sacrilegious, to look like them religious jeans
Blame her mother, but don't tell her dad
His chid gotta heavenly body, but one hell of an ass

[Verse 2: Jae Millz]
Hold up, wait a minute
Let me put some Millzy in it
Ain't no hands inside her body, but I bet she feel me in it
That bedroom in danger when we desoliving anger
I work her ass out so good she got rid of her trainer
Talk to me, bad bitches they honk to me
GTV-shot non-stop now watch that pussy walk to me
Fuck 'em all girl, we gon' make them sweat
Our top down and it ain't even at weather yet, so

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ace Hood]
Okay now do me like a favour, or do me like a chore
Or do me in your favourite red bottoms, oh Lord
I say my guardian angel, I swear her features a blessin'
She gon' learn today, I taught that pussy a lesson
I beat that up like I just made hell, kiss that pussy whenever do tell
Give her that package, you got mail
When it kind of your love I'll take that (?)
I'm lookin' for you girl, and do shit a molly world
I want a rotten fish, old Tuna spoil you girl

[Verse 4: Gudda Gudda]
She makes that ass clap, like a naughty girl
Introduce you to some better things I can show you girl
Lights on, but take that Prada off, I beat it like a xylophone
No phones, but I can be the one that you're calling on
Talk to me baby, walk with me baby
Then we can take a long ride in this charcoal Mercedes
I'm the boss you my lady
You keep it wet, I go underwater swimming
I be a shark for you baby

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Mack Maine]
Man I got pussy from my angel, head from my angel
I spent a night in heaven, me and Elvis split a Mango
She had that aquafina mermaid wet wet
I heard the love gods hollerin' out, "Man, we got next"
Her physique is unique like the clothes from boutique
Hit that ass 'til she peak and can't speak
She got wings on that pussy, she's so fucking fly
And everybody say she's dope, but this another high

[Verse 6: Birdman]
Talk to me baby my lady and my friend too
Notice flower bomb the scent when she breeze through
Bitches hatin' cause we sitting on top
When you walk the block the traffic stop
The 2-seater that I copped, that's for me and you
Drop the top back, your hair breezing through
I lay my stunt down proper, top shotter original (?)

[Hook][Verse 1: Ace Hood]
Another statistic, nah
I just wanna live in Gods cubicle, far away from Lucifer
Not a slave, gold chains compliment the mula’ much
Rather see me crucified, police are the crucifiers
Shoot us up and dig a ditch, this ain't nothin’ new to us
Murders happen every day, kids on their merry way
Dyin’ before they’re 21, bullets never had a name
God bless Trayvon Martin I’m in my hoodie
Another innocent young brother who met a bully
Man this poor world is fucked up
Hard times, tough luck
Section 80, food stamps, jobs never hired us
I’m just tryna’ fulfill my wishlist
Don't wanna be another statistic

[Hook : Ace Hood]
Don’t wanna be another statistic
Don’t wanna be another statistic
Another statistic

[Interlude]
No matter what obstacles come our way
No matter how much they're trying to keep us down
Nothing should stop us from being victorious
We shall fight
We will never give up
We will never give in
We shall take it to the mountain top
Nobody could hold us down, I say nobody

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
Martin Luther King had a dream and my niggas do too
While Emmett Till beat and killed and gouged like a fruit
Reason why them youngin’s untamable as a youth
And fuck the government cause’ they trying to disguise truth
I send my prayers out to mankind
Not enough graduations but too many crimes
Pay attention as a parent gotta peep the signs
Feeling like a book is corny so they keep a nine
Lord bless em’ got me stressin’ while I’m raising mine
See in the hood people think you won’t amount to nothing
Funny, I made a million out of 10 cents
Don’t wanna be another statistic (preach)

[Hook : Ace Hood]

[Interlude]
We refuse to be apart of divine violence
We refuse to be stepped on
We gotta stand for something
We don't fall for anything, stand up
Whats all the pain you been through?
It's time, It's time to stand as one
Stand up for one another
We will not lose

[Verse 3: Ace Hood]
Niggas getting murdered with burners few in the sternum
Jot it in my journal why killers are so determined
I keep on preachin’ defeat the demons in every sermon
Just watch the people that meet and greet ya’
Some aren’t worthy
Some friends aren’t friends, they dirty need some detergent
So many tragedies around the world, I’m praying urgent
I’m just trying to become a blessing and serve a purpose
Nobody’s perfect, I’m still sinning just have mercy
While we killing our own people
Boston Massachusetts bombed by some thrill seekers
It’s just so tragic, many perished I could barely witness
Don’t wanna be another statistic (pray)

[Hook: Ace Hood](Intro)
Yea, Ace Hood
Feel me?
What?
Damn
People

(Hook)
Everything that shines ain’t a diamond
Tomorrow is a gift that ain’t promised
Nobody’s perfect, we all need alignments
And things are understood more with time and
If I die would you miss me?
If I fall would you lift me?
I swear life is such a mystery
I’m livin to become a part of history

(Verse)
Look in the mirror I can see your shame
Know you’re hurt but I don’t know your name
See you smile just to cover pain
While you patiently waitin for change
Tears runnin like a faucet
Hear the whispers as they gossip
Pretty girl with a cold heart
Life is like a script, she just playin the part
Love found in the wrong place
Self-esteem at its lowest rate
Mama gone, fuck her whereabouts
Plenty sold dreams, man in and out
Ain’t seen her dad like in 7 years
So she usin drugs just to try and heal
If I fuck you would you promise to stay?
She don’t know no other way
Bad bitches in my living room
Mind thinkin I’mma get it soon
Thinkin all the ways I’mma get that
Long legs, I’mma have em pinned back
Pretty as a summer day
And cold as a winter night
I pray that every soul gets to shine bright
Lord knows when the time right

(Hook)
Everything that shines ain’t a diamond
Tomorrow is a gift that ain’t promised
Nobody’s perfect, we all need alignments
And things are understood more with time and
If I die would you miss me?
If I fall would you lift me?
I swear life is such a mystery
I’m livin to become a part of history

(Verse)
Mama told me
Hard head make a soft ass
Dollar bills make a poledance
She ain’t interested in any romance
Better come and get with the program
How was life when yo daddy gone
Only daughter, she bein let on
How the character know she dead wrong
Facin karma, it’s comin head on
She think she grown, only 17
Whole world that she never seen
Many men have travelled in-between
Said he love er then flip it like it’s a trampoline
Cold world, keep your sweater close
Doin' 40 in the Phantom Ghost
Keep the ones who you love close
No assuming but you just never know

(Hook)
Everything that shines ain’t a diamond
Tomorrow is a gift that ain’t promised
Nobody’s perfect, we all need alignments
And things are understood more with time and
If I die would you miss me?
If I fall would you lift me?
I swear life is such a mystery
I’m livin to become a part of history

I’m livin to become a part of history[Hook]

[Verse 1]
From the bottom to the top I came so far so I neva stop
Product of my block what a Glock in a black boy wit them locks
Ridin' in the Maybach and we way back how we're looking for far
How the fuck I'm getting this, diamonds cost a couple bricks
Peep the rollie on my wrist, I understand why niggas pissed
Got no time for niggas hatin', I just make some reservation
When they come down to my niggas ain't no sense of hesitation, no
Champagne sipping every night is moving scripted
Hop up in that coop you know that bitch si go to missin
Too much liquor, bad decisions, we're just living like fuck tomorrow
Hit the club and buy it out, like fuck the bar
See them pretty fancy cars, better know what's us
And my niggas do the same thing
I give em a job and they give minds to same way
I pray that we ball forever, we all on the same page
Look, how far we came

[Hook]
Started all broke, penny in my pocket

I pray we ball 4 eva
4 eva eva, 4 eva eva

Choppa clip come extended, for pussy niggas intendended
All these niggas we love and then hate
Government name when I walk int he bank
Ballin bitch Lebron in the paint
Still I ride what half a tank
Most these niggas claiming they real
And when them hard nights and then feel
Meeting my dog got jammed, did bout a couple years in that cell
Now I'm riding off in that aston, kick a whip in that Porsche
India off in that BMW, your next move is that Forbes
Young niggas, young niggas, fuck boys can't run with us
Tuck toys, you dumb boy, that Glock kick like a four wheeler
Ain't two shows in one day, seat recline no PJ
Take a look in my niggas face, oh Lord how far we came
Went from struggle and from finer things
Now is platinum chains and diamond rings

[Hook]
Started all broke, penny in my pocket
Tryin to live a dream, accumulate the profit
Now we're getting money, Monday through the Sunday
On another level, my niggas

I pray we ball 4 eva
4 eva eva, 4 eva eva

[Hook]

Talk about it, make em talk about it
Life to me is currency, prosperity I got it
And your life to me is lifeless like its livin' on life support
I license everything in my wallet, lightest boy with the biggest heart
Nigga play your part or parallel park your ego next to me and violence
Next to me is definitely no one, I'm one of one
And I musta won that from anybody who had it or better yet forgot it
Mack in the back of a 'Lac with a mac in the back of a 'Lac
With a latch on the back of the trunk
Hit a punk in the back with a pump in the back, till he's off balance
And I'm back in the front of the front of the future
When you are mentioning talent
And I'm back in the back of the block
With a cop wanna cop anybody's allowance
Iraq on the block G watch for the block or whatever
And cut no cut more guns more guts fuck boy you fucked up twice you fucked considerin' you drownin'
Die in a lake with a date with a catfish back flip head first smilin'
C-cry in the face of Jesus we just pray we keep on stylin'
On you bitches TDE YMCMB business bitch

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
Okay nigga riding in a May-be, and I'm probably with Baby
Dont talk nigga fuck you pay me, intercept your bitch like Bailey
Okay big money on this side, 100 grand for the whip my bitch drive
Need a new safe money getting too high, dead presidents all in my Levis
Boy I swear this nigga be swagging, and I'm living lavish
Might cop me an Aston, Martin on 'em
Anything I drive I own 'em, bad bitch and that ass ain't normal
Gotta put that pound game on her, beat it up she deep in a coma
I'm super paid, 2 shows a day
My rollie gold, no time to waste
What it do Berg, my fuckin' brother
Keep that pistol by me like my lovely momma
Hot as the summer, cold as the winter
Stay on them charts, I heard that they plotting my timber
Young nigga, got a lot of flows
Any nigga don't believe me, I make it look easy easy out of control

[Verse 3: Birdman]
Box full of choppers, hand on the trigger
Uptown gangsta, get it how we get it
Third Ward soldier, suicide rider
Militant minded, hundred mill on the counter
Hand-Persian rug nigga, flame on the Bugatti
Christian Louboutin, Chanel for my models
Higher than Bugatti nigga, fishing on the fish scales
Nose diving for them hundreds, strapped up making mail
Fr-fresher than I been before
Higher than we even been, shining on them 24’s
Junior doing time ho
On the grind ho, while he doing time ho

[Interlude: Mack Maine]
Ya know!
The time is money and money still was made baby
Eight months ain’t stop nothing nigga
It’s like jail was third base and my lil’ nigga still came home, ya understand

[Verse 4: Mack Maine]
I’m from the hood where bitches hold coke in they baby diapers
That’s why when the babies grow up damn they be like us
I came a long ways from rhyming up in crazy cyphers
Man I’m so happy my lil’ brother came home from Rikers
Shout out to BP, Thugga, Flow and [Fail Boy?]
My flow Lucifer, I spit hell boy
My heart numb, ain’t no pain I can’t withstand
And I hold my niggas down boy like a kickstand
Get off my nuts, stop acting like a bitch fam
Lil’ nigga finish puberty, grow ya own dick damn
I went from watching time fly on Earl and Red porch
To cruising through the streets of Miami in a red Porsche
Me and Stunna fly, we should join the Air Force
Stand up niggas, the fuck you brought them chairs for?
I went from making money from people with crack habits
To thanking God I’m in a whole ‘nother tax bracket
Amen{DJ Folk~!}

[Hook: Ace Hood]
Before the rollie, before the fame
Before the money, before the game
Before them bitches
Before they ever knew my name
Before the rollie, before the rollie
Them times was hard, I'm chasin' money
Before the rollie, before the rollie
The same circle, the same homies

[Ace Hood]
My same niggas, no new friends
Since day one, nigga no loose ends
Just a young nigga, outchea every day
I'mma get it by any means
That was just my mind frame
Before the Gucci and Louis
Before the Rollie dog I went through it
They ain't never fuck with me when I was broke
You ain't gonna stunt with me when I do it
Talk is cheap gotta put in that work
Remember them days I was ridin' in the merk
No A/C cause the shit don't work
Plus no radio to make shit worse
I'da come a long way and they know it
Fuck where you at its about where you goin'
Can't sit around and wait for no money
Ain't no naw nigga can't do it
Boy I did this shit for my niggas
Since day one I been a go getter
Now my money right and these hoes on me
Ho well go figure (Hoodnation)

[Hook]

[Ace Hood]
Ain't never had shit for' my dream
Ain't never sell no work to them fiends
Ain't never snitchin' and tell on my dogs
Wakin' up every day for that cream
Nigga I was down and out in that field
So stressed out because of them bills
Ain't no kinda hope in my city
Most my homies dead or in jail
Every night I toss and I turn
Feelin' like the Devil all on my back
Still I'm praying times get better
Had a few thoughts sell in that pack
Boy my mom gon' cuss me out,
Runnin' her blood pressure so high
When that money comin' in slow
It'll be a couple homies that rot
I'm that same nigga from out of Deerfield
Ain't shit changed except a rap deal
Gotta little money niggas actin' funny
Now I know how niggas in the trap feel
Ya'll rather me broke than be fucked up
And my same hood and those same chucks
I look back today throw prayers up
Now I never forget where I came from

[Hook]

[Meek Mill]
Before the rollie man it was cuffs
Hard times man shit was tough
I was told don't trust niggas
Be the main ones to come and hit you up
Still ridin' round like I ain't rich as fuck
Young niggas we clippin' up
Before the rollie hoes fronted on me
Now I pull up on em like bitch whats up?
Young niggas ballin'
Fuck niggas hatin'
Before I had a rollie
I ain't have no patience
A nigga ran up on me
Be a sad situation
We cap'n gown you pussy niggas ain't talkin' graduation
See there was something 'bout that Rollie when it touched my wrist
Something 'bout that Rollie when I fucked your bitch
Cause it caught her eye and she sucked my dick
She told you lies and you trust that bitch
Like hol' up
Ya'll niggas hatin' on me
When all these bad bitches waitin' on me
And all that shit you pray on me
I still kill niggas like shame on me

[Hook]
