[Intro]
Don't you ever forget. Don't you ever take sides with anyone against the family. Do you hear me? Ever

[Hook: Dej Loaf]
Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (static)
I swear I love my city, I just want a little (static)
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (static)
Detroit vs. Everybody

[Verse 1: Trick Trick]
What up doe, everybody? I'm Detroit
So it's me vs. everybody if you ain't Detroit
We all hood, we love the gun smoke
A message from air traffic control
I'm doin' them niggas bold
Takin' it back to when rappers got beat up out their clothes
Treat 'em like little hoes
Used to wake up to snitches swingin' from light poles
When the booger shook took a light those
Shout out to every nigga that ever made money over in Brightmoor
With the white folks, in the window like a psycho
Puttin' the perfect play together, maestro
And since it's so cold in the D, if you don't come to see me
You might fuck around and see a nigga ice go
Had a lil' homie, run up on him with a knife though
Aiight ho, watch the big homie on the roof with the rifle
Who might go loco and shoot for nothin'
Will go postal with you for somethin'
And I'm willin' to give it to keep the counterfeits up out of my city
Ask around and they all know Tricky
Still pull it together for the kitty
Pour a little liquor for Biggie
And Frank Nitty on the Mickey, send 'em to Diddy
Tried to get me a spot on the Revolt
Switch a man's past from the revolt
Touchin' mothafuckas with the remote
Think your man sleepin' out here but nigga please, he woke

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Dej Loaf]
Ayo east side, raised on that east side
When we just throw our pinkies up along with the peace sign
Fairview street sign, who the fuck are these guys?
Niggas want war, we make 'em feel it, touch their G spot
My grandma sold pies and I ain't talkin' 'bout no key lime
Junkies at the side door, make sure that ain't 5-0
They done set her up, they done hit her with that combo
They done let the dogs out, house smellin' like Pine Sol
That was on the north end, I was on the porch then
Grandma what you cookin' up? Grandma why that fork bent?
Grandma where my mom at? Now I want her, beep her up
Always imagined we was poor and that her feet was up
Jordans, yeah we had 'em on, bitch it wasn't no teasin' us
Remember me and Pooh was in the window eatin' peanut butter
Damn I miss my cousin, I'm like R.I.P. to Trina's son
I'm from where it ain't no love, everybody need a gun

[Verse 3: Guilty Simpson]
Detroit V.S. everybody, P.S
Fuck y'all too, we don't care what y'all do
Still, you can't deny the real
Time reveal, society squeals and the society kill
Money motivated though we take it
These cats are overrated, severely, poppin' up yearly
Then they disappear within the same year
Like it never happened, them niggas just rappin' barely
I'm a shooter, loadin' my magazine and throw the book at 'em
Like a prosecutor, the Glock'll do you like a college tutor
Cause right after class
I teach a mothafucka somethin' and watch him pass
Graduation, I rattle cages
We make some uncomfortable, I didn't grow up like the Huxtables
West 7th where those drugs'll move nonstop
Soft white or hard rock, get everybody in your yard shot
You'll get a feel for my city when I send the welcoming committee
With the 50 calibers and the smoke grey Dodge Challengers
You frown on your face, we'll kick it pretty
When I grip the semi, you better have some grip to give me
Or the steel smokes, you cats are real jokes
You bitch niggas, smack your face numb like you feel coke
Until you get the big picture, mothafucka

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Black Milk]
Let the celebration kick off
This that point in the party where that person start pointin'
That pistol because they're pissed off
Shots lick off, fire spit off
This track put a fire up under me like rockets when they lift off
The map, these rappers that recite raps
We don't believe 'em like that
Deadbeat dad sayin' that he'll be right back
But city that's rough and looked at as them black sheeps
With them rap sheets that's long as track meets
So let's take a stroll, come follow me down these back streets
Where blacks and the trap meet
Killers and dealers that had dreams to be athletes
But them dreams got put in the back seat
And makin' fast funds the shotgun
Got some homies that's still in the hood, life finna twirl
They ask me "what is it like to see the rest of the world?"
Away from the block, away from the gutter
All they know is the blocks and watchin' for cops undercover
So what you have here, some niggas that's never had a fear they couldn't face
Tougher than '89 Laimbeer in the paint
Posted, Chuck D coachin', never laid up
City soil that made us
7 mile with the players, Puritan and PA-ers
[?] where the bullets strayin'
Fenkell where the bodies layin'
6th mile where them hollows sprayin'
Woodward where they ain't playin'
Schoolcraft you find that mayhem where hollows holler in the AM
Gratiot where grandma's stayin'
Neighborhood that's decayin'
Niggas pockets is light so that light bill they're never payin'
So fam don't let your lips talk, that could be your pitfall
And get you sprayed on like murals on side of brick walls
Dudes watchin' waitin' for you to get sloppy
Like a hitman lurkin' in the shadows with his shotty
Out here screamin' "Let's go", yeah my nigga X know
City where the TECs blow but we ain't talkin' techno

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Sino]
I'm stumblin' in my Detroit fitted, bitch
Anybody want some beef then we with it, bitch
Shit, see in the Mitten all my niggas 'bout that action
Might be 30 niggas with me, every nigga with me packin'
No fly zone, shit, just for pussies on that fuck shit
Dirty glove, boy this ain't the city to be fucked with
Shout out my uncle Trick, you get to trippin', he gon' dump quick
My city verses everybody (you gotta kill everybody!)
Boy, RIP to Blade, I hope he hear this
I swear if Ron was free, he'd be the first nigga to kill this
Street nigga, give me a ki and I'ma deal it
Better give a nigga his cash or you can feel it
What up Em, signed the city to Shady and fuck it
They say the world is a bitch, I'ma keep on fuckin' it
My city on my back and I'ma keep on runnin' it
Still got that chopper on the back seat, ain't shit sweet, boy

[Verse 6: Marv Won]
40287, I'm out that black bottom
If they don't fuck with the boy, I bet the crack got 'em
It's enough two faces here to attack Gotham
And ain't nobody a ho until the MACs spot 'em
Dot 'em, play possum, no brave option
All of mine yay choppin' and K shoppin'
The nerve this nigga here can play the part of a goon
Transplant your killers if it ain't no heart in the room
Wait 'til he sugar sharp and then throw salt in the wound
These red beams'll turn your white party maroon
I got a pair of gators that I hardly wear
Nigga I will kill you over these Cartiers
I got a couple bands with the dice on the floor
When I was 9, boy I could tell you the price of a bow
Listen, full length minks just to show we stuntin'
Brother you know it's nothin'
Nigga I'm Komen youngin', tell 'em!

[Hook]

[Verse 7: Payroll]
I'm from the west side blocks where we roll in spots
And have blow blowout sales to blow out a watch
Young niggas gettin' popped cause of the clique they claim
And in most homicides, it's a bitch to blame
My future plan's to stay froze 'til my wrist complains
If rap fails, I'm whippin' coke 'til the brick complains
In the new 6 switchin' lanes, probably with big kis
Ain't talkin' coffee when I say the trunk is where the big be
You see that D right above where my lid be
Can't trust a soul, well that's how these streets did me
I bossed up from setbacks by luck, I rep that
Ain't scared of nigga's shit, I'm from Detroit, I expect that

[Verse 8: Hydro]
Look I'm from Detroit, bitch
Where we crack heads and we break bails
Inspired by the dopeman that pack hammers and make sales
Dreaming of a rollie, a coupe, a crib off of late trails
They quick to take a trip with so much weight that it'd break scales
Young boys wilding, with a chopper they'll make hail
Screaming "fuck the cops" and quick to pop off like some fake nails
Shout out to my strippers with 30 inches and fake tails
And pounds of the cookie like I was running a bake sale
Holla if you need it, I got it, just come and ask the man
Try me and get cheddar on your hand just like a Packer fan
Riding down your mama street with tints on a blacker van
And turn your block into a war zone like we in Pakistan
Nobody I can call on, it's ball or get balled on
Wrists full of that shit you niggas can slip and fall on
Why the fuck you hating us when we can put them all on?
And they can help their little mans and they can hit the mall strong
It's 7 Mile 'till I die, raised by some street niggas
Fuck friends, ain't got none, I'm dolo with this heat, nigga
Boogers in my watch face, my wrists be looking slimey
Once I fuck she's like my seatbelt, I put that bitch behind me, nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 9: Big Gov]
My timing was perfect, designed to be worshiped
Like Jesus as a fetus
Was destined to earn my stripes like Adidas
Needless to say I'm the sniper
Pick us off, niggas soft
While they spitting bars in the middle of a cypher
I'm from the same hood as Big Meech and Big T
So miss me with ho shit or end up on this street
Home of the big three; big cuffs, big guns, big chips
Where broke niggas get hood rich off of quick flips
I'm from the city where the bitches even gangster
Suck a nigga dick, get her robbed, tell 'em thank you
We don't fuck with you outsiders, learn who to talk to
Or get stomped for feeling like the man when you walk through
And I don't even walk around with my chest out
But know it's drama when you see me with my vest out
My next route is finding out where you rest at
Catch you sleep, make the crime scene where you slept at
And the next cat who disrespect my city on some rap shit
I'm on his ass like cellulite on a fat bitch
This shit is drastic and you ain't gotta ask if
A nigga come disrespectful, he leaving out in a casket

[Verse 10: Boldy James]
Detroit VS everybody, that's me against the world
I might not sell a cop, but who need a brick or girl?
A thousand grams on my cock, later alligator
Moist of the aviator, cardi sipping activator
Never been a punk, faker or a lean whipper
Steady packing eighters in a one paper king swish
Concrete, definition of real street nigga
Whole hood know that I'm the only real D nigga
That really mean it when you hear me say I am Detroit
Can hear it in my voice, my fault Em and Royce
For being four days late turning my verse in
But me and Ready Rock was in the spot putting that work in
What was you doing before you ever touched your first ten?
I was in the streets with my peeps getting them chirps in
Text me when the work gone, I text him back the work end
Tryna get my hands on the pack when they first in
On my Captain Planet I possess earth, wind and fire
But you being a liar is the worst sin
Keep throwing rocks at the throne with a glass chin
I'm still that same nigga on the corner with a half grin
I never let these niggas use my ears for no trash cans
Been selling dope for too long, it's time to cash in
King James, before this rap shit I had street fame
And the keys to the city on my key chain

[Hook]

[Verse 11: Kid Vishis]
Whoever said Vishis phony, get to know me
Our hollows'll make a rapper drop the mic, no diss to Joey
Guns of all sizes, I fire and get smokey
Riding with the biggest ratchet on the car dash, I call it Khloe
You think you hard? I think you doughey
His guts'll fall out looking like someone stuck a knife in a stoagie
Homie, you owe me your life
I'm Columbine balling, throwing a stripe
Wiping you out and bounce like a thief in the night
I now control machinery, it's like real steel
Gun ductaped to the tires, that mean I will kill
They say I'm fooling to 'em
They asked me for a hot sixteen
So I lit my notebook on fire and threw it to 'em
Here's a DeJ Loaf punchline
I kill your whole family and leave a red trail, that's your bloodline
Try me, I bust nines
Stick a clock in his mouth and make him chew
Yeah, nigga, it's crunch time

[Verse 12: Big Herk]
We got them choppers, how a nigga with a knife gon' win?
Y'all just shooting the breeze, they done let a cyclone in
This what happen when little mama boys trapped grown men
Lyrically ahead of my time like the iPhone 10
And why Detroit always get a bad name?
My city ready to blow like we here to gas, mane
These niggas thinking they dope, but their shit a tad lame
Man, their pen and pad game more like Trinidad James
Fuck you and whoever you run with
I'm on that BS, I'm still in the middle with dumb shit
I'm a beast, everything you hear me spit real tight
Your flow wack, it's out of Egypt, nigga, it's real light (get it?)
I'mma keep it real, niggas can't fuck with me
It's like I contracted Ebola, they ain't touching me
Detroit VS Everybody, niggas know we started that
Now every city all across the world want a part of this

[Hook]

[Verse 13: Icewear Vezzo]
Street niggas smarter than Kwame, bustin' hardbody
Panorama fold up Porsche, let the car box me
I know niggas ain't sold shit, they did armed robberies
Rugrats buying out bottles and playing with old Tommy's
East side, come to the zone, that's where the lions play
Young niggas stepping on blow, that's where the tigers stay
In my hood the first of the month, that shit a holiday
These cemeteries meet their capacity every fathers day
Hit a lick, keep all the work, get the stolie back
Tell a jeweler don't say shit, just get the Rollie checked
If them niggas bump one lip then get your homies wacked
I swear that you knew my boss, bitch, I'm Tony Jack
Real shooters run in the trap with them choppers out
Heard them niggas bumping their gums, see what they talkin' 'bout
In a spot with so much syrup, this bitch a waffle house
Hit the pharma with so many scripts, could buy the doctors out

[Verse 14: Detroit Che]
I'm Detroit Che
I'm as sick as some syphilis, sicker than Detroit hate
If you come knocking then it's trick or treat
I call up Tricky, load that shit then let that trigger squeeze
That shit ain't sweet, I'm from the murder mitten
Never thought my friend would've been a murder victim
I'm in that van, I want revenge, I'm on some Kendrick shit
I'm pissed off like a mistle, his dick's soft, he's ticked off, he can't get shit hard
If you diss my city I will set it off with a motherfucking semi that's bigger than Big Sean
Our city is Marshall Mathers on Adderall
You better pray we not mad at all when them gats involved
With swisher cap, we're flicking your fucking city off
I'll bust your fucking noggin, you disrespecting my city, dawg
I'm queen Che been on the throne for a minute
Before the cypher I've been slicing dice, these hoes will admit it
Bitch, I'm Slim Shady, we louder than M80's
No, I'm just playing, hope he hears it, I'm just saying
I'm a renegade, pussy sweeter than lemonade
You'll never penetrate
DeJ, tell these bitches to try me, I'mma demonstrate
Vez, tell them that I got options, I'm a real estate
On them properties like monopoly
Detroit VS Everybody, I make a verse versus everybody
Fuck your city, no fly zone, nigga, it's Detroit Che versus everybody
Detroit vs everybody, it's Detroit vs everybody
Fuck your city, no fly zone, nigga, it's my city versus everybody

[Verse 15: Calicoe]
(I just have to talk shit for a minute, man
I have to get in my zone, man, huh
It's the going, going, back, back to Cali, Cali, to Cali Cali)
Cali Cali, that's where I get them cheaper at
Your number like my number, I need a number I can reach you at
Want my price, then you get a price, I want at least a stack
You pay my flight, then you pay your flight, I'll meet you back
Middle man in my own plug, I can teach you that
Detroit vs everybody, who could compete with that?
You thinking everybody zips slow cause they got a plug?
My nigga, everybody zips slow cause I'm showing love
So whenever you make a flip again just know I'm showing love
If cash die, I'm on the strip again, just know I'm throwing dubs
Big roochies on the Michelins, rolling A1 dubs
Mind on my money, fuck a nigga tryna hold a grudge
Them crabs in the bucket used to slow me up
And now I'm sitting at the top and it's lonely as fuck
Got 20 thousand for my red bottoms
Cause I was standing in this blood after I headshot 'em, nigga

[Verse 16: Diezel]
It's me, bitch
Mafia captain, OG, bitch
20 years, been Detroit vs whoever, nigga
The right hand to the hand that be gettin' niggas
Goon squad mafia, mobbin'
For this dirty mothafucka, where it's my home
And I love this mothafucka
So I stood on the front line, ready for one time
Duck some shots, and buck bled for my line
All for the love of the palm of the dirty glove
Every hood, every block, nigga one love
7 mile is the hood where I came up
Pray the game keep it and get your weight up
Bitch you better say us when you're talkin' 'bout next
Detroit niggas stood up when put to the test
Like what? Nigga, who? What the fuck
Anybody wanna do? We ain't hear shit
One army, one city, one sound
It's Detroit, gon' shut shit down
It's time to return the king his crown
Fuck who got next, nigga we got now[Sample of "BABY!" repeats throughout the song]

[J Dilla - Intro]
Let's go!
Turn it up...live niggas throw it up
It's the official, we got the bank for ya...
GO!

[Guilty Simpson]
You can catch Guilty Simpson at a rave with babes
Packin a .38 snub and a razor blade, uh!
Thug shit in a major way
I kick ya dog's ass like a Flavor Flav
Thug niggas with guns beneath leathers
If you know better, keep ya bitch on tether
Niggas got snow like cold cold weather
And big money clips cause they fold dough better

[J Dilla]
Yeahhh! Packin three cuties in the Hemi
I be runnin hoes like Luke in Miami
So I hit her gotta get the half of my jimmy
I don't mean to pimp that hard, it's just in me
Got a sick flow and a couple of pistols
Got this thick chick Coco in 'Cisco
The same day I met her, we backstage in the bathroom
She got a mouth like a vacuum, uh!
We them boys with the chains on our neck
E'ry five minutes we untanglin' them
It's Pay Jay make sure the name on the check
Jay Dee in the turnin' lane with ya ex like Los Angeles

[Guilty Simpson]
...and the nights are scandalous
Thick like big bread basket sandwiches
Choke on that, we smoke on bats
And put a hole through the horse on your Polo hat
And leave the shit smokin where the logo at
And the witnesses won't tell po-po jack, uh!
That's how it is when we fuck shit up
(Kill it!) People hoes horny and the blunts lit up
FEEL IT!

[J Dilla]
Yup, real talk y'all
I met this girl last night, she whispered in my ear like
[*singing*]
Baby, you're the one..
Baby, take me home tonight
Baby, lay me doooown..
Baby, girl it's only right
Baby, you're the one..
Baby, you're the one for me
Baby, (yeaaah!)
You should be havin my baby (Turn it up!)
You should be havin my baby

[J Dilla]
It's the official, {?} make the wrist glow
Think it's a disco when I ran Bisco
If you feelin' it, where your Earl Flynn at?
Cut the check, Tim tell em where to send at
That you {?} my man Phat, tell me where ya friends at
Kay moved to the valet where the Benz at
Let's be...

[Guilty Simpson]
...out ridin high
Girls stop when they see the clique ridin by, on jock
They ain't invited unless they gon' drop
You do it how I like it and make it go pop
If all's agreed, we got weed
Skatin' through the area, movin' at Mach speed
Makin moves is a must - why bother doin it
If what y'all doin ain't 'bout dollars?

[Madlib]
All my...("BABY!") girls always lookin for me
My kids' moms always lookin for me
They lookin good for me
You what? - You gon' stick with her or me?
Damn girl, you always givin the third degree, you still my ("BABY!")
Always keepin me up on my toes
Unless I'm out creepin on do's or sleepin with hoes
Still my ("BABY!), cakes with cakes upon cakes
(Ay, where my money at?) Keep a nigga spendin papes

[J Dilla - Outro]
Turn it up another notch
Yeah, that's how we doin it
Broadcasting, LIVE from WBBE
You know how we do it
We got a special guest in the house
He goes by the name of Dave New York
Dave, we talkin 'bout, hip hop and radio
Dave, where you at with it?

[Dave New York]
How do I feel about radio hip-hop?
I think it's wack, most of the shit they play is straight GARBAGE!!...
[*echoes*][Intro:]
[Sample]
Searching all in my mind
[Guilty Simpson]
I can do no wrong
I can do no wrong

[Verse 1: Guilty Simpson]
Yo, I'm in the zone
I'm feeling like none can stop me
On the throne
I've never been a carbon copy
On my own
Tip for the hecklers that laughed hard for checking us
Just leave us alone
I'm feeling good
Today is the day I get all that I should
And all things said by me is understood
Cause everybody on the same page
Operating with the same ways
It's no stress
I used to get so depressed
What a mess I created
I thought I wouldn't make it
But I met and exceeded the expectations
Finally made it out the basement
Now I get placements
The results of patience
Now I see the title's for the taking
It sits vacant
So every day I'm granted, I understand never to be complacent

[Hook:]
I can do no wrong
I can do no wrong
Mind on alert
Eyes see clear
It's no fear
Heart beat strong
I can do no wrong
I can do no wrong
I can do no wrong

[Verse 2: Guilty Simpson]
Yeah I'm wide awake
I'm staring down the hopeless face
Of adversity but never will I break
Then I make the appropriate steps
To get me ahead so I can maintain the pace
I move like rents do
And you can see it real from the shit we been through
Experience speaks volumes to those who try hearing it
Chill and burn something
You might learn something
It's never too late
My homie move drugs at an incredible rate
Till the judge looked him dead in the face and said my name:
"Guilty."
Then it hit my brain
Homeboy this is not your lane
Set me straight
I had to change my path
Change my friends
Change my math
I think about it now and laugh
Yeah, it's funny now
Cause a brother gettin' money now

[Hook][Hook]
Don't it make you feel alright?
Say it again
*yeahhh*
Say it a little louder
*yeahhhhh*

[Verse 1: Guilty Simpson]
Yeah
I should call this liver
V8 Juice, black licorice nasty
You can't outclass me
Too much street savvy
I speak stern
Picture me robbin' a cabbie
I used to put regs in baggies
Now I puff meds of algae
I crumple up pieces of bong hits
And load 'em in my M420
(Then what?)
And provoke more envy
Send me my dough in advance
Steal from me?
And leave with a hole in your hand
Yeah
The heater stay clipped up
Your chick is a walking strip club
We throw her the dough and she dance...wherever
I better bet her I'm better, bet a motherfuckin' bow
I'm doin' rappers bold
I punch his lights out like, "Damn, he's out cold."
I slaughter for my honor, you leave with head trauma

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Planet Asia]
All hail the fly wise men
My enterprise been on the rise and
I see you sizin' us
Large bark leaf, dark leaf, blendin' my broccoli
The pot in me has got me seein' it all sparkly
I'm a mobster
Loungin' with my bitch eatin' Long Beach lobster
I love me some fish
And them hatin' ass niggas wanna know if my shit sells
I'm good in the hood as long as I got fish scale
You'll never find a nigga that's this real
To ash blunts on the Aston and treat a Benz like a big wheel
And you ain't gotta tell me my shit's ill
Cause if I leave with your main squeeze that bitch will
And you better sit still
And chill when I fell for the jooks
Niggas get billed and killed for the fraudulent looks
For the big bills I'm mobbin' with the gods and the crooks
And I guarantee you that shit'll slap hard in the trunk

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Guilty Simpson]
Big dog, I'm a Rottweiler
I'm gettin' bread, I'm a stockpiler
I'm cold-hearted for a hot dollar
See rappers gettin' buzzed tryin' to sound like me
I just smile like a proud father
Loud ganja
You think I give a fuck about your list?
Them clowns don't exist
That's how I feel with a skill set like this
I hit 'em with a black fist
? style afro pick
The gats go click and clack at 'em
He holler back at 'em
With more force
I'm all for us
To travel to your home court
(What?)
And go to work to work with a blow torch
Torched ya scorched ya whole corpse
There's no remorse for 'em
Talkin' ain't enough, we use brute force on em
We never let it ride
So violate mine?
Just know
You cats got a war comin'

[Hook][Intro]
Yeh, you know it yeh
Detroit City
Guilty Simpson, clap it up y'all
Beats at will, yeah

[Verse 1]
I don't really care what squad you wit
Cause a real nigga don't need sponsorship
And a posse don't make me hard
I'm a leader so I gotta play these cards and face these odds
Ain't no time to chase these broads
Tryin to get paper to create these jobs
And it's a fact when you're black that you don't know how to act
When your bellybutton's touchin your back, yeah
That's why a lot of us fuck with the crack
Cause it's the easiest way to double your stacks
And all the hoes scream "Where the hustlers at?"
Usually the pretty chick with the bubble in back
Word to Dilla dawg I'mma get it all
Combination safe behind the picture on the wall
Even though moms raised me right
I swear to God rap shit saved my life

[Hook]
Yeah, all the people in the back sippin 'gnac
We representin for y'all niggas, do it! ("clap your hands")
C'mon, it's a party
("You and you and you to clap your hands") Everybody
All my people with the drinks in your cups
Turn the muh'fuckers up and go nuts

[Verse 2]
My mood swings like pendulums; I got two birds
One's a middle finger and trust me that's the friendly one
Because my Desert Eagle will kill all who envies him
We transport info quicker than Pentiums
I'm gutter, what I'm spittin is classic
So walk on eggshells or I bury you bastards
I rep the D, so when you speak about me
I'm the letter between C and E
In fact I'm the 1 between 3 and 3
With a smokin gun commitin B and E's
And I don't fake at all, all I can be is me
And if you don't like it I dare you to get excited
Detroit nigga my area is the tightest
The raps come easy, live it see it and write it
Drug war shoutout mentally sick men
Naturally my breed's equipped with thick skin

[Hook][Verse 1: Sean Price]
Chewbacca
Duece-duece Papa now rocking your shoes proper
True shotta, nigga you noose nada
My three versus your four, who crew's hotter, Random
Everbody on my team is winners
Everybody on your team beginners
Why you do that, rapper
Fucking new-jack rappers
Flinch when I walk by cause I do smack rappers
Sean the Barbarian
Deadly dose of the dope shit, black tar heroin
The best out, bar-for-bar Pa
His god given talent scream Al hum du'Allah
You got no skills, you got no talent
You're shit no frills and your bitch toss salad
Niggas rap albums sound like love letters
Pen in my hand like, damn fam, I can do much better

[Refrain]

[Verse 2: Guilty Simpson]
I write classics, you can't hack it
You know what it is
In the room with the floor covered in plastic
Passive, never got a street-cat pay so I'm active
Stay back
I keep that blade
Hi, hater
I'll carve a smile right next to your frown like laugh now, cry later
Potato on the barrel
French-fry ten guys
For major violations, call it annihilation
Your tough talk, I don't get it
You wouldn't fight a ticket
So why recite a lyric
Especially when lyrics get a rifle at your fitted
I'm sure to buck so tell Pac what up though
My foes better be real
You wanna be tough, alright you'll forever be still
Still I get nicer, yet I'll ice you
And rhyme with the force of a Jedi cyhper

[Refrain]

[Verse 3: Roc Marciano]
Marcberg, baby fire it off
Split your cabbage
Bitch ass rappers spit garbage
Live lavish, Mac-10's under big jackets
Hit me a pass, flip that mattress
Remember the patterns
Five stay dipping in traffic
Parle stiff in the cabin
With axes, dismember a faggot
Limbs is scattered and littered with maggots
Splashed with gas, we lit up matches
That's for acting real tepid and passive
Ya'll asking to give out passes
I pull up, get out Astons
But never without ratchets
Busters feel our wrath and
Butlers will fill our glasses
Brothers ain't up in our bracket
Slugs from the gattling, spin out rapping
Flip the casket, lyrics is crafted
Hit them with the plastic and then I'll pass it[Verse 1: Mr. Porter]
The games about to get hot
Ayo doc, you better tell them other producer niggas that they bet' not drop
Wait
Cause Mr. Porter ain't playing
What the fuck is you saying, I'll fuck over you mans
When my crew get to bringing some guns and start the spraying
Have the whole crowd bowing like some Muslims praying
Boy, this niggas mad cause I fucked his toots
I got a way with hoes, my dicks long as Yao Ming foot, nope
Nope nope nah nigga your shits invalid
I'm bout money, you chasing bitches like Jimmy Fallon
Well I'm the type to get 'em fucked up, drunk and wiling
All crunk in the G-5 smilin, that's how I (get em, get em)
See if you want that ho back, you ain't close to no pimp you should focus on rap
I got bars big as coconuts nigga in fact
I keep a nine and a extra clip next to my sack

[Verse 2: Guilty Simpson]
I don't give a damn my nigga
Peep me out I got a bomb ass gun and a landmine trigger
Posted at the bar, where I slam my liquor
Ya'll ants to me, like grandma sisters
You little insect fucks'll get crushed
No rap clique exists, it's just us
Saw you little fags, posing in the pages of the rap mags
And I am the black flag
Spraying ya'll chumps to death, I'm that bad
And I don't even speak to cats, I'm that mad
So if I was on some brand new shit
So what, you little coward niggas won't do shit
Approach with caution, your mans got issues
And I'm a great shot the heat, will not miss you
If we got problems, I will not diss you
I'm a sic the dogs on ya'll to come get you

[Jay Electronica:]
Six minutes Jay Elect you're on
I transform, and blast on a nigga like megatron
I got the power
I'm on fire like the west wing of the Pentagon and the North Tower
I'll break yo ass off proper
The resident doctors giving out one way tickets to ask Biggie Smalls who shot ya
These fuck niggas ain't real like Snuffleupagus
That's why when they bumpin they gums, we let the muskets buss
You don't believe me, ask em
We smack rappers in they face, spit on they kicks, and blast 'em
Yeah, get nervous now
I'm a fuckin animal with the verbs and nouns
I'm a fuckin cannibal in the herd of clowns
You niggas look like heaps of steaks and burger mounds
When my ears start ringing, and them voices say hit' em
I have no motherfucking choice but to get 'em[Verse 1: Torae]
With all due respect, I barely respect niggas
Nike sweat suit, I'm ready to check niggas
Give 'em scarf work, I'm all on your neck nigga
Sway the revolution by waving the Tech nigga
Wake Up Show
Still sleep, time to wake up though
You might see me with the mac, but it ain't makeup yo
I make up flows, to cake up and make up mo'
Stay low so the jake don't know
Bae bro, this heat take
Time to make sure that the street straight
Lock it down on the release date
Bury the beat breaks
Heavy on the beat until the beat breaks
Bag a bad bitch then beat brakes
Double entendres
Barrel brothers is double the monsters
While Random Axe is at it bonkers
We body your roster
In broad daylight
Tell 'em "rockabye baby" until they all get the concept

[Verse 2: Guilty Simpson]
Yeah
Chip off the old block, a great shot
From right here, I can pick off your whole block
Pick off my old knot
My pocket is a dead president's cemetery
I get your buried and I still pistol carry
It goes without saying, I'm spraying at niggas who change clothes
Used to keep work with one my main hoes
Then I had to dump her and grind it all summer
Your frontrunners turn gum-bumpers
My gun slump ya and leave you in a slum dumpster
My understanding is zero, try to play hero
I'll point a desert eagle at your ego
That's just me though
Squeeze the hammer when I see a vandal
And beat enamel off his teeth with the heater handle
Fuck around and violate the squad, I'ma buck 'em down
Who got the muscle now?

[Hook: Skyzoo]
All in together now
It's whatever now
Jordan 3s and 'lo knit sweaters now
Know the league is ours like forever now
50-40 and 90 if you let us now (x2)

[Verse 3: Skyzoo]
Ugh
Monclair skully is fitting me like a crown
I'm all year money so this isn't coming down
The talk here is funny, I'm listening for them now
We all here hungry but shit if they want a round
Now, do believe I'm true indeed the 2 to 3
Shuttlesworth and I'm Buttersworth on a shooting spree
Sharp-shooter, park shooters, move the Cs
Get it? Shuttlesworth? Part seas?
JESUS
Are we to end at the same dot?
The throne for the crate, I'll slip you a straight swap
Man down, kudos and you know
You stand up with me
You standing next to the Pharrell like a Hugo
And for this new wave that's all swinging for mine
I was probably hitting your moms and penning your rhymes
I can't lie if seen me in and out of your place
I should've stuck to my gut and let it rock in her face
Now pay homage

[Verse 4: Sean Price]
All praises due
Respect that, say that Sean shady too
P, shake salter the shakiggity salt shaker
Not condusive to big words like Walt Frazier
I'm more major but I'm minor to Ebro
Touring all the time, what the fuck does he know?
10% bloodsucker of the poor
I'll untuck the gun, buck the sucker on the floor
P
I don't like boy rappers
All marked for death like the white boy Hatcher
I'm no racist so white boy rappers is good money
Look I just despise toy rappers
Sean is the shit
The shit Sean spit is legit
Legitimate bars, pa you a ignorant bitch
Hip hop hooray
Be happy a nigga here for hip hop today
P[Hook: Black Milk]
We got another one popping
Turn it up a notch and keep rocking
Turn it up a notch and keep knocking
The haters wanna look, then keep watching
(Ha Ha) Laugh at them, let them look
Cause they know they can't stop us
(Know they, know they) Know they can't top us
Keep dropping, niggas keep watching

[Guilty Simpson]
This one is sinful sentiments
I keep a pump like adrenaline
The opposite of innocent, gun play is imminent
The penmanship red, your dead, scribbled in blood
Wannabe thugs fled and gave the ground a hug
I got an airhead rat I like to keep doped up
Told her that she was dreaming, her man got his throat cut
Jedi mind trick a bitch, push a sell and get a chick to split the L
If the pigs flick the whip, give me bail
"What up, though?" to Brooklyn, the dogs are loose
Who calling troops? The shotguns tossing goose
And broke the treaty, I'll smoke you easy
Murder City where the rich are broke and peazy

[Trick Trick]
What the hell? I reckon they want a twelve
The second I heard this record, I figured I might as well
Aggravate and piss off those that can't stand me
Like man and the man is trying to raise a family
Ban me, I said it and I don't give a fuck, call me the outlaw
Thinking I need this business? I can do without ya'll
As long as Agent K is making fully-automatics, I'mma get it
And I ain't bullshitting you can forget it
Pussy-ass niggas popping shit on they webpages
The game has become outrageous
The stage is set for real niggas to come out with them gauges
And the gangsters out of them cages

[Hook]

[Sean Price]
Off the wall, no curl kit, no electric socks
Your world flip, pearl grip on the sket that pop
Murder, death, kill, Villain from the 'Ville
Pill-poppin', still real cocaine-cooking niggas drill poppin'
Sean Price the name, Random Axe is the group, duke
I spray shots in vain cops, fuck it you loot, duke
Hippity-hop niggas wanna rap in the booth cute
Meanwhile I got crack stacked up in the deuce shoe
Fuck fame, homie, I rap for the change only
Counter-punch suckers for lunch, I'm James Toney
You got the star look, but your ring and your chain's phony
Back of 'The Source' jewels, slap, we force cool (Ooh!)

[Rock]
We all one in the same
It's like I am Ruck, I am Black Milk, B
I'm Trick Trick, I am Simpson, but I'm not guilty
Rock filthy, the block's feel me
I own them, fuck a Donald Trump, I'm 'Donald Dump' I got realty
See me in HD, high-def, definitely high
Stunting caught 'em all, berry niggas cry
Oh, I know Inspectah Deck 'em in the eye
You not doing the electric, I ain't letting niggas slide
Act up, it's ramifications of blamming a gauge in
Your face, It's beef, not the shit on a sandwich your making
Amateurs faking but don't respect or knock your ganstafications
Me? I'mma a monster, my mere presence will panic a nation
Niggas 'bout as loyal as Popeye bitch Olive Oyl
No beef raps, but I got drama for you
Think about it, you know who I got with me
Brooklyn, Detroit, same shit, they both 'Rock City'[Sample of "BABY!" repeats throughout the song]

[J Dilla - Intro]
Let's go!
Turn it up...live niggas throw it up
It's the official, we got the bank for ya...
GO!

[Guilty Simpson]
You can catch Guilty Simpson at a rave with babes
Packin a .38 snub and a razor blade, uh!
Thug shit in a major way
I kick ya dog's ass like a Flavor Flav
Thug niggas with guns beneath leathers
If you know better, keep ya bitch on tether
Niggas got snow like cold cold weather
And big money clips cause they fold dough better

[J Dilla]
Yeahhh! Packin three cuties in the Hemi
I be runnin hoes like Luke in Miami
So I hit her gotta get the half of my jimmy
I don't mean to pimp that hard, it's just in me
Got a sick flow and a couple of pistols
Got this thick chick Coco in 'Cisco
The same day I met her, we backstage in the bathroom
She got a mouth like a vacuum, uh!
We them boys with the chains on our neck
E'ry five minutes we untanglin' them
It's Pay Jay make sure the name on the check
Jay Dee in the turnin' lane with ya ex like Los Angeles

[Guilty Simpson]
...and the nights are scandalous
Thick like big bread basket sandwiches
Choke on that, we smoke on bats
And put a hole through the horse on your Polo hat
And leave the shit smokin where the logo at
And the witnesses won't tell po-po jack, uh!
That's how it is when we fuck shit up
(Kill it!) People hoes horny and the blunts lit up
FEEL IT!

[J Dilla]
Yup, real talk y'all
I met this girl last night, she whispered in my ear like
[*singing*]
Baby, you're the one..
Baby, take me home tonight
Baby, lay me doooown..
Baby, girl it's only right
Baby, you're the one..
Baby, you're the one for me
Baby, (yeaaah!)
You should be havin my baby (Turn it up!)
You should be havin my baby

[J Dilla]
It's the official, {?} make the wrist glow
Think it's a disco when I ran Bisco
If you feelin' it, where your Earl Flynn at?
Cut the check, Tim tell em where to send at
That you {?} my man Phat, tell me where ya friends at
Kay moved to the valet where the Benz at
Let's be...

[Guilty Simpson]
...out ridin high
Girls stop when they see the clique ridin by, on jock
They ain't invited unless they gon' drop
You do it how I like it and make it go pop
If all's agreed, we got weed
Skatin' through the area, movin' at Mach speed
Makin moves is a must - why bother doin it
If what y'all doin ain't 'bout dollars?

[Madlib]
All my...("BABY!") girls always lookin for me
My kids' moms always lookin for me
They lookin good for me
You what? - You gon' stick with her or me?
Damn girl, you always givin the third degree, you still my ("BABY!")
Always keepin me up on my toes
Unless I'm out creepin on do's or sleepin with hoes
Still my ("BABY!), cakes with cakes upon cakes
(Ay, where my money at?) Keep a nigga spendin papes

[J Dilla - Outro]
Turn it up another notch
Yeah, that's how we doin it
Broadcasting, LIVE from WBBE
You know how we do it
We got a special guest in the house
He goes by the name of Dave New York
Dave, we talkin 'bout, hip hop and radio
Dave, where you at with it?

[Dave New York]
How do I feel about radio hip-hop?
I think it's wack, most of the shit they play is straight GARBAGE!!...
[*echoes*][Verse 1: Montage One]

Well orchestrated word play complicated
Obligated from bar one to sixteen
Hooks with the deadliest catch the amphetamine
Dope rhymes like coke lines of ketamine
Beats cooked in the jungles of the Medallín
With blood diamonds rap blinding better bling
Mac ten machine clapping everything
And GPS lyrical threats mapping everything
I got the game in the scope and the cross hairs
Wild grizzly punchline you park bears
Full mansion studios in dark lairs
Nigga we not fare murder rappers right there
And emancipate songs in a greater rate
I leave critics to talk like its Laker hate
Fly rap over heads I aviate
And bang beats to death like a skull from heavy weight...[Hook: Fat Ray]
Get the hardware, take it to the enemy
The hard-heads all here, man the artillery
Niggas go to war for their liberty
Black ops, arms and abilities

[Verse 1: Guilty Simpson]
I'll turn your favorite artist to a mural
Put papes on it, with his birthday
A dash, and today's date on it
I didn't know I was confusing you, shit
We gotta eat, even murder these a musical this, this
This isn't for the weak hearted
You're who the streets target
With the tattle team, so we hurt one
Put them in the hospital, get them all together
And then the whole waiting room is getting magazines
Splatter dreams
Attitude is like gimme money and a bag of green
I'm blowing smoke signals at an Indian broad
I told her I'm unemployed please give me a job
This grade A potent and grade A smoke
I'm loving it
R.A. wrote the grade A dope for hustling
And where we from and where P from
It's guaranteed cats in the hood is gon' fuck with it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Sean Price]
Question, why you hem your jeans
Y'all niggas looking like Ben Vereen
Don't get rocked, pa, Benjamin Grimm
With a nine double m on the scene
Fuck around and make your Timberlands swim
Drown nigga
Fucking clown nigga
313 and Buck is the town, nigga
I'm Sean, King of the Apes
You prawn, king of the shrimps
Funny style, limp wristed son of a bitch
This nigga put fingers on this trigger
One or two pulls, this nigga is disfigured
I'm a good father but I really be illing
Colt .45 on my side, no Billy Dee Williams
Around blocks niggas like where the work at, behind you
Right on the corner in the jaw of a minor
Your whole crew is pussy and very vagina
Promise to bust your snotbox whenever I find you, P

[Hook][Intro] [Guilty Simpson talking]:
It's good. It's called change. I got little something for you man
It's called change. Listen

[Verse One]:
With nowhere to go he's homeless
Saving for a hit of that blow
To this kids he's a no show
They only see him clean in a photo
A shell of a man that once provided
When the divorce came the kids sided
That's when the dream and life collided
Losing this family was a low blow, so
Deeper in the bottle he goes
And everyday powders his nose, he's fadin'
Heard the wife found a replacement
With a nice bank statement, he can't win
Make him want to call it quits
Get a bottle of pills and take all the shit
And when he ask, "Who's fault is this?"
And the answer came
He realized there's a chance to change, come on

[Hook]:
What do you do, with nowhere to go?
The pain of this life is killing you slow
Not too many highs, and endless lows
Nowhere to go, yeah
With nowhere to go

[Verse Two]:
Yo, nowhere to go, she's homeless
Saving for a hit of that blow
To her kids she's a no show
They only see her clean in the photo
Yeah, shell of a woman that once provided
When the divorce came the kids sided
That's when the dream and life collided
Losing the family was a low blow, so
Deeper in the bottle she goes
And every day powders her nose, she's fadin'
Heard the hubby found a replacement
With a pair of fake tits, she can't whip
Makes her wanna call it quits
Get a bottle of pills and take all the shit
And when she asks, "Whose fault is this?"
And the answer came
She realized there's a chance to change, come on

[Hook]:
What do you do with nowhere to go?
Bangin to this life is killing you slow
Not too many highs endless lows
Nowhere to go, yeah
With nowhere to go

It's called change
It's called change[Verse 1: Sean Price]
Chewbacca
Duece-duece Papa now rocking your shoes proper
True shotta, nigga you noose nada
My three versus your four, who crew's hotter, Random
Everbody on my team is winners
Everybody on your team beginners
Why you do that, rapper
Fucking new-jack rappers
Flinch when I walk by cause I do smack rappers
Sean the Barbarian
Deadly dose of the dope shit, black tar heroin
The best out, bar-for-bar Pa
His god given talent scream Al hum du'Allah
You got no skills, you got no talent
You're shit no frills and your bitch toss salad
Niggas rap albums sound like love letters
Pen in my hand like, damn fam, I can do much better

[Refrain]

[Verse 2: Guilty Simpson]
I write classics, you can't hack it
You know what it is
In the room with the floor covered in plastic
Passive, never got a street-cat pay so I'm active
Stay back
I keep that blade
Hi, hater
I'll carve a smile right next to your frown like laugh now, cry later
Potato on the barrel
French-fry ten guys
For major violations, call it annihilation
Your tough talk, I don't get it
You wouldn't fight a ticket
So why recite a lyric
Especially when lyrics get a rifle at your fitted
I'm sure to buck so tell Pac what up though
My foes better be real
You wanna be tough, alright you'll forever be still
Still I get nicer, yet I'll ice you
And rhyme with the force of a Jedi cyhper

[Refrain]

[Verse 3: Roc Marciano]
Marcberg, baby fire it off
Split your cabbage
Bitch ass rappers spit garbage
Live lavish, Mac-10's under big jackets
Hit me a pass, flip that mattress
Remember the patterns
Five stay dipping in traffic
Parle stiff in the cabin
With axes, dismember a faggot
Limbs is scattered and littered with maggots
Splashed with gas, we lit up matches
That's for acting real tepid and passive
Ya'll asking to give out passes
I pull up, get out Astons
But never without ratchets
Busters feel our wrath and
Butlers will fill our glasses
Brothers ain't up in our bracket
Slugs from the gattling, spin out rapping
Flip the casket, lyrics is crafted
Hit them with the plastic and then I'll pass it[Intro]
Yeh, you know it yeh
Detroit City
Guilty Simpson, clap it up y'all
Beats at will, yeah

[Verse 1]
I don't really care what squad you wit
Cause a real nigga don't need sponsorship
And a posse don't make me hard
I'm a leader so I gotta play these cards and face these odds
Ain't no time to chase these broads
Tryin to get paper to create these jobs
And it's a fact when you're black that you don't know how to act
When your bellybutton's touchin your back, yeah
That's why a lot of us fuck with the crack
Cause it's the easiest way to double your stacks
And all the hoes scream "Where the hustlers at?"
Usually the pretty chick with the bubble in back
Word to Dilla dawg I'mma get it all
Combination safe behind the picture on the wall
Even though moms raised me right
I swear to God rap shit saved my life

[Hook]
Yeah, all the people in the back sippin 'gnac
We representin for y'all niggas, do it! ("clap your hands")
C'mon, it's a party
("You and you and you to clap your hands") Everybody
All my people with the drinks in your cups
Turn the muh'fuckers up and go nuts

[Verse 2]
My mood swings like pendulums; I got two birds
One's a middle finger and trust me that's the friendly one
Because my Desert Eagle will kill all who envies him
We transport info quicker than Pentiums
I'm gutter, what I'm spittin is classic
So walk on eggshells or I bury you bastards
I rep the D, so when you speak about me
I'm the letter between C and E
In fact I'm the 1 between 3 and 3
With a smokin gun commitin B and E's
And I don't fake at all, all I can be is me
And if you don't like it I dare you to get excited
Detroit nigga my area is the tightest
The raps come easy, live it see it and write it
Drug war shoutout mentally sick men
Naturally my breed's equipped with thick skin

[Hook]You gotta look around, there ain't nothin' changed
I sho' hope somebody's listenin' to what I'm sayin'

[It'll be a cold day in hell
I would never change, my style or my profile]

Coroner Music, G.S. boi!
O.J. Simpson...

[Verse 1]

Coroners must love my shit for certain, I keep 'em workin'
Cause your boy got pull like a diesel person
In this rap tug-o-war, I yank the cord and watch 'em all fall down
My rapport is lethal, no equal, no survivors, no sequel
None compare, they crumble when the monster stares
I see through you, my heat do to you what they should have did
Molotov cocktails tossed in ya crib
Death to the fake is the only way to live
Mama said give, car is charity
Guns at the temple for a moment of clarity
There's no comparing me, please!
I'd rather be a corpse than compared to these wack emcees
Make a list, whoever you dudes take, never confuse great
I do 'em in like tube steak, and digest 'em
Seven Mile section, vest for protection, it's no correction
Guilty, I got next, and a red-dot to the chest of these of these so-called high prospects
I got techs and techniques unknown to those
That misrepresent the stage when I stole the show
Detroit the city you suppose' to know, already
Respect my home, the dreads heavy
Deadly in the jungle, wit' a machete
Choppin' through vines, organized crime
Solar eclipses couldn't stop my shine
Tryin' to sabotage when I jot my rhymes
On a stone tablet, I use hammer and nails
Poppin' aspirin, the rap game environment(?) is hell
Stay ???, they wanna do me in like Kwame
So I killed Patrick, it's still practice
To keep it ghetto, pull more strings than Geppetto
And laugh while the stray echo, and wake up neighbors
What I toke's ridiculous, I spit black licorice flavor
How you a playa? they put you waivers
Black acid, when I drop on paper
O.J. Simpson, Ode to the Ghetto: The Remixes
Evil, like three sixes[Verse 1: Guilty Simpson]
Dear Jane
We need to call it quits
Cause every time you come around I want a hit
But when I can't have you, it's like I throw fits
With you, I can't fuck with, you're a counterproductive bitch
Whoa
Promiscuous queen, down for anything
Yet I see you in my dreams
But everybody calls trying to get you on the team
Yet you don't claim em, still, I can't blame em cause
You keep changing
Gettin' better with time
One session, you clouded my mind
I can't think straight
I think we need breaks
Long overdue
When I land in the city, I'm looking for you
I make a phone call, sure enough, you're coming through
Miss Mary
You got a strong hold on me, and that's scary
I quit

[Hook]
I quit
I, quit
I quit

[Verse 2 Guilty Simpson]
I quit, yeah, it's over (it's over)
You're gettin' the cold shoulder
It's easier when I'm sober
You make pebbles out of boulders
I quit, yeah, we're through
I'm rollin' solo, there's no me and you
And I know exactly what you gonna do
Find another taker, it's nothin' new
Or should I say another victim
I'm hooked, but I gotta get you out of my system
I vowed I won't sweat you
You're known to crumble under pressure
I admit, she makes me feel better
That's why a lotta go-getters go get her
Miss Mary
You got a strong hold on me, and that's scary
I quit

[Hook]
I quit
I, quit
I quit
I quit (I quit)

[Outro: Sample]
Everything, everything, everything[Intro]
Don't you ever forget. Don't you ever take sides with anyone against the family. Do you hear me? Ever

[Hook: Dej Loaf]
Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (static)
I swear I love my city, I just want a little (static)
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (static)
Detroit vs. Everybody

[Verse 1: Trick Trick]
What up doe, everybody? I'm Detroit
So it's me vs. everybody if you ain't Detroit
We all hood, we love the gun smoke
A message from air traffic control
I'm doin' them niggas bold
Takin' it back to when rappers got beat up out their clothes
Treat 'em like little hoes
Used to wake up to snitches swingin' from light poles
When the booger shook took a light those
Shout out to every nigga that ever made money over in Brightmoor
With the white folks, in the window like a psycho
Puttin' the perfect play together, maestro
And since it's so cold in the D, if you don't come to see me
You might fuck around and see a nigga ice go
Had a lil' homie, run up on him with a knife though
Aiight ho, watch the big homie on the roof with the rifle
Who might go loco and shoot for nothin'
Will go postal with you for somethin'
And I'm willin' to give it to keep the counterfeits up out of my city
Ask around and they all know Tricky
Still pull it together for the kitty
Pour a little liquor for Biggie
And Frank Nitty on the Mickey, send 'em to Diddy
Tried to get me a spot on the Revolt
Switch a man's past from the revolt
Touchin' mothafuckas with the remote
Think your man sleepin' out here but nigga please, he woke

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Dej Loaf]
Ayo east side, raised on that east side
When we just throw our pinkies up along with the peace sign
Fairview street sign, who the fuck are these guys?
Niggas want war, we make 'em feel it, touch their G spot
My grandma sold pies and I ain't talkin' 'bout no key lime
Junkies at the side door, make sure that ain't 5-0
They done set her up, they done hit her with that combo
They done let the dogs out, house smellin' like Pine Sol
That was on the north end, I was on the porch then
Grandma what you cookin' up? Grandma why that fork bent?
Grandma where my mom at? Now I want her, beep her up
Always imagined we was poor and that her feet was up
Jordans, yeah we had 'em on, bitch it wasn't no teasin' us
Remember me and Pooh was in the window eatin' peanut butter
Damn I miss my cousin, I'm like R.I.P. to Trina's son
I'm from where it ain't no love, everybody need a gun

[Verse 3: Guilty Simpson]
Detroit V.S. everybody, P.S
Fuck y'all too, we don't care what y'all do
Still, you can't deny the real
Time reveal, society squeals and the society kill
Money motivated though we take it
These cats are overrated, severely, poppin' up yearly
Then they disappear within the same year
Like it never happened, them niggas just rappin' barely
I'm a shooter, loadin' my magazine and throw the book at 'em
Like a prosecutor, the Glock'll do you like a college tutor
Cause right after class
I teach a mothafucka somethin' and watch him pass
Graduation, I rattle cages
We make some uncomfortable, I didn't grow up like the Huxtables
West 7th where those drugs'll move nonstop
Soft white or hard rock, get everybody in your yard shot
You'll get a feel for my city when I send the welcoming committee
With the 50 calibers and the smoke grey Dodge Challengers
You frown on your face, we'll kick it pretty
When I grip the semi, you better have some grip to give me
Or the steel smokes, you cats are real jokes
You bitch niggas, smack your face numb like you feel coke
Until you get the big picture, mothafucka

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Black Milk]
Let the celebration kick off
This that point in the party where that person start pointin'
That pistol because they're pissed off
Shots lick off, fire spit off
This track put a fire up under me like rockets when they lift off
The map, these rappers that recite raps
We don't believe 'em like that
Deadbeat dad sayin' that he'll be right back
But city that's rough and looked at as them black sheeps
With them rap sheets that's long as track meets
So let's take a stroll, come follow me down these back streets
Where blacks and the trap meet
Killers and dealers that had dreams to be athletes
But them dreams got put in the back seat
And makin' fast funds the shotgun
Got some homies that's still in the hood, life finna twirl
They ask me "what is it like to see the rest of the world?"
Away from the block, away from the gutter
All they know is the blocks and watchin' for cops undercover
So what you have here, some niggas that's never had a fear they couldn't face
Tougher than '89 Laimbeer in the paint
Posted, Chuck D coachin', never laid up
City soil that made us
7 mile with the players, Puritan and PA-ers
[?] where the bullets strayin'
Fenkell where the bodies layin'
6th mile where them hollows sprayin'
Woodward where they ain't playin'
Schoolcraft you find that mayhem where hollows holler in the AM
Gratiot where grandma's stayin'
Neighborhood that's decayin'
Niggas pockets is light so that light bill they're never payin'
So fam don't let your lips talk, that could be your pitfall
And get you sprayed on like murals on side of brick walls
Dudes watchin' waitin' for you to get sloppy
Like a hitman lurkin' in the shadows with his shotty
Out here screamin' "Let's go", yeah my nigga X know
City where the TECs blow but we ain't talkin' techno

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Sino]
I'm stumblin' in my Detroit fitted, bitch
Anybody want some beef then we with it, bitch
Shit, see in the Mitten all my niggas 'bout that action
Might be 30 niggas with me, every nigga with me packin'
No fly zone, shit, just for pussies on that fuck shit
Dirty glove, boy this ain't the city to be fucked with
Shout out my uncle Trick, you get to trippin', he gon' dump quick
My city verses everybody (you gotta kill everybody!)
Boy, RIP to Blade, I hope he hear this
I swear if Ron was free, he'd be the first nigga to kill this
Street nigga, give me a ki and I'ma deal it
Better give a nigga his cash or you can feel it
What up Em, signed the city to Shady and fuck it
They say the world is a bitch, I'ma keep on fuckin' it
My city on my back and I'ma keep on runnin' it
Still got that chopper on the back seat, ain't shit sweet, boy

[Verse 6: Marv Won]
40287, I'm out that black bottom
If they don't fuck with the boy, I bet the crack got 'em
It's enough two faces here to attack Gotham
And ain't nobody a ho until the MACs spot 'em
Dot 'em, play possum, no brave option
All of mine yay choppin' and K shoppin'
The nerve this nigga here can play the part of a goon
Transplant your killers if it ain't no heart in the room
Wait 'til he sugar sharp and then throw salt in the wound
These red beams'll turn your white party maroon
I got a pair of gators that I hardly wear
Nigga I will kill you over these Cartiers
I got a couple bands with the dice on the floor
When I was 9, boy I could tell you the price of a bow
Listen, full length minks just to show we stuntin'
Brother you know it's nothin'
Nigga I'm Komen youngin', tell 'em!

[Hook]

[Verse 7: Payroll]
I'm from the west side blocks where we roll in spots
And have blow blowout sales to blow out a watch
Young niggas gettin' popped cause of the clique they claim
And in most homicides, it's a bitch to blame
My future plan's to stay froze 'til my wrist complains
If rap fails, I'm whippin' coke 'til the brick complains
In the new 6 switchin' lanes, probably with big kis
Ain't talkin' coffee when I say the trunk is where the big be
You see that D right above where my lid be
Can't trust a soul, well that's how these streets did me
I bossed up from setbacks by luck, I rep that
Ain't scared of nigga's shit, I'm from Detroit, I expect that

[Verse 8: Hydro]
Look I'm from Detroit, bitch
Where we crack heads and we break bails
Inspired by the dopeman that pack hammers and make sales
Dreaming of a rollie, a coupe, a crib off of late trails
They quick to take a trip with so much weight that it'd break scales
Young boys wilding, with a chopper they'll make hail
Screaming "fuck the cops" and quick to pop off like some fake nails
Shout out to my strippers with 30 inches and fake tails
And pounds of the cookie like I was running a bake sale
Holla if you need it, I got it, just come and ask the man
Try me and get cheddar on your hand just like a Packer fan
Riding down your mama street with tints on a blacker van
And turn your block into a war zone like we in Pakistan
Nobody I can call on, it's ball or get balled on
Wrists full of that shit you niggas can slip and fall on
Why the fuck you hating us when we can put them all on?
And they can help their little mans and they can hit the mall strong
It's 7 Mile 'till I die, raised by some street niggas
Fuck friends, ain't got none, I'm dolo with this heat, nigga
Boogers in my watch face, my wrists be looking slimey
Once I fuck she's like my seatbelt, I put that bitch behind me, nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 9: Big Gov]
My timing was perfect, designed to be worshiped
Like Jesus as a fetus
Was destined to earn my stripes like Adidas
Needless to say I'm the sniper
Pick us off, niggas soft
While they spitting bars in the middle of a cypher
I'm from the same hood as Big Meech and Big T
So miss me with ho shit or end up on this street
Home of the big three; big cuffs, big guns, big chips
Where broke niggas get hood rich off of quick flips
I'm from the city where the bitches even gangster
Suck a nigga dick, get her robbed, tell 'em thank you
We don't fuck with you outsiders, learn who to talk to
Or get stomped for feeling like the man when you walk through
And I don't even walk around with my chest out
But know it's drama when you see me with my vest out
My next route is finding out where you rest at
Catch you sleep, make the crime scene where you slept at
And the next cat who disrespect my city on some rap shit
I'm on his ass like cellulite on a fat bitch
This shit is drastic and you ain't gotta ask if
A nigga come disrespectful, he leaving out in a casket

[Verse 10: Boldy James]
Detroit VS everybody, that's me against the world
I might not sell a cop, but who need a brick or girl?
A thousand grams on my cock, later alligator
Moist of the aviator, cardi sipping activator
Never been a punk, faker or a lean whipper
Steady packing eighters in a one paper king swish
Concrete, definition of real street nigga
Whole hood know that I'm the only real D nigga
That really mean it when you hear me say I am Detroit
Can hear it in my voice, my fault Em and Royce
For being four days late turning my verse in
But me and Ready Rock was in the spot putting that work in
What was you doing before you ever touched your first ten?
I was in the streets with my peeps getting them chirps in
Text me when the work gone, I text him back the work end
Tryna get my hands on the pack when they first in
On my Captain Planet I possess earth, wind and fire
But you being a liar is the worst sin
Keep throwing rocks at the throne with a glass chin
I'm still that same nigga on the corner with a half grin
I never let these niggas use my ears for no trash cans
Been selling dope for too long, it's time to cash in
King James, before this rap shit I had street fame
And the keys to the city on my key chain

[Hook]

[Verse 11: Kid Vishis]
Whoever said Vishis phony, get to know me
Our hollows'll make a rapper drop the mic, no diss to Joey
Guns of all sizes, I fire and get smokey
Riding with the biggest ratchet on the car dash, I call it Khloe
You think you hard? I think you doughey
His guts'll fall out looking like someone stuck a knife in a stoagie
Homie, you owe me your life
I'm Columbine balling, throwing a stripe
Wiping you out and bounce like a thief in the night
I now control machinery, it's like real steel
Gun ductaped to the tires, that mean I will kill
They say I'm fooling to 'em
They asked me for a hot sixteen
So I lit my notebook on fire and threw it to 'em
Here's a DeJ Loaf punchline
I kill your whole family and leave a red trail, that's your bloodline
Try me, I bust nines
Stick a clock in his mouth and make him chew
Yeah, nigga, it's crunch time

[Verse 12: Big Herk]
We got them choppers, how a nigga with a knife gon' win?
Y'all just shooting the breeze, they done let a cyclone in
This what happen when little mama boys trapped grown men
Lyrically ahead of my time like the iPhone 10
And why Detroit always get a bad name?
My city ready to blow like we here to gas, mane
These niggas thinking they dope, but their shit a tad lame
Man, their pen and pad game more like Trinidad James
Fuck you and whoever you run with
I'm on that BS, I'm still in the middle with dumb shit
I'm a beast, everything you hear me spit real tight
Your flow wack, it's out of Egypt, nigga, it's real light (get it?)
I'mma keep it real, niggas can't fuck with me
It's like I contracted Ebola, they ain't touching me
Detroit VS Everybody, niggas know we started that
Now every city all across the world want a part of this

[Hook]

[Verse 13: Icewear Vezzo]
Street niggas smarter than Kwame, bustin' hardbody
Panorama fold up Porsche, let the car box me
I know niggas ain't sold shit, they did armed robberies
Rugrats buying out bottles and playing with old Tommy's
East side, come to the zone, that's where the lions play
Young niggas stepping on blow, that's where the tigers stay
In my hood the first of the month, that shit a holiday
These cemeteries meet their capacity every fathers day
Hit a lick, keep all the work, get the stolie back
Tell a jeweler don't say shit, just get the Rollie checked
If them niggas bump one lip then get your homies wacked
I swear that you knew my boss, bitch, I'm Tony Jack
Real shooters run in the trap with them choppers out
Heard them niggas bumping their gums, see what they talkin' 'bout
In a spot with so much syrup, this bitch a waffle house
Hit the pharma with so many scripts, could buy the doctors out

[Verse 14: Detroit Che]
I'm Detroit Che
I'm as sick as some syphilis, sicker than Detroit hate
If you come knocking then it's trick or treat
I call up Tricky, load that shit then let that trigger squeeze
That shit ain't sweet, I'm from the murder mitten
Never thought my friend would've been a murder victim
I'm in that van, I want revenge, I'm on some Kendrick shit
I'm pissed off like a mistle, his dick's soft, he's ticked off, he can't get shit hard
If you diss my city I will set it off with a motherfucking semi that's bigger than Big Sean
Our city is Marshall Mathers on Adderall
You better pray we not mad at all when them gats involved
With swisher cap, we're flicking your fucking city off
I'll bust your fucking noggin, you disrespecting my city, dawg
I'm queen Che been on the throne for a minute
Before the cypher I've been slicing dice, these hoes will admit it
Bitch, I'm Slim Shady, we louder than M80's
No, I'm just playing, hope he hears it, I'm just saying
I'm a renegade, pussy sweeter than lemonade
You'll never penetrate
DeJ, tell these bitches to try me, I'mma demonstrate
Vez, tell them that I got options, I'm a real estate
On them properties like monopoly
Detroit VS Everybody, I make a verse versus everybody
Fuck your city, no fly zone, nigga, it's Detroit Che versus everybody
Detroit vs everybody, it's Detroit vs everybody
Fuck your city, no fly zone, nigga, it's my city versus everybody

[Verse 15: Calicoe]
(I just have to talk shit for a minute, man
I have to get in my zone, man, huh
It's the going, going, back, back to Cali, Cali, to Cali Cali)
Cali Cali, that's where I get them cheaper at
Your number like my number, I need a number I can reach you at
Want my price, then you get a price, I want at least a stack
You pay my flight, then you pay your flight, I'll meet you back
Middle man in my own plug, I can teach you that
Detroit vs everybody, who could compete with that?
You thinking everybody zips slow cause they got a plug?
My nigga, everybody zips slow cause I'm showing love
So whenever you make a flip again just know I'm showing love
If cash die, I'm on the strip again, just know I'm throwing dubs
Big roochies on the Michelins, rolling A1 dubs
Mind on my money, fuck a nigga tryna hold a grudge
Them crabs in the bucket used to slow me up
And now I'm sitting at the top and it's lonely as fuck
Got 20 thousand for my red bottoms
Cause I was standing in this blood after I headshot 'em, nigga

[Verse 16: Diezel]
It's me, bitch
Mafia captain, OG, bitch
20 years, been Detroit vs whoever, nigga
The right hand to the hand that be gettin' niggas
Goon squad mafia, mobbin'
For this dirty mothafucka, where it's my home
And I love this mothafucka
So I stood on the front line, ready for one time
Duck some shots, and buck bled for my line
All for the love of the palm of the dirty glove
Every hood, every block, nigga one love
7 mile is the hood where I came up
Pray the game keep it and get your weight up
Bitch you better say us when you're talkin' 'bout next
Detroit niggas stood up when put to the test
Like what? Nigga, who? What the fuck
Anybody wanna do? We ain't hear shit
One army, one city, one sound
It's Detroit, gon' shut shit down
It's time to return the king his crown
Fuck who got next, nigga we got now[Verse 1: Supa Emcee]
Y'all wanna bite and sample him
Screaming, "I got tracks by Dilla" (Nigga)
Nigga, Charles Hamilton
Lying for the camera, damage you, Jeru
Beat a nigga red 'til he think he Blood or Piru
On the internet like you know Ma Dukes
Well Ma Dukes'll probably puke at the site of you
Motown rebirthed a monster, no baby food
Still a nigga throw fits like babies do
Boost my heart, this is for the Yancey team
I wrote these words like James Yancey theme
(Give 'em horror Sup!)
Retribution, reverts behind a true score
(Scream!) Nigga, this Dilla music
Somehow the drum and hi-hat makes me abuse it
For Jay Dee I'm a soldier, every sound's a movement
General selector, army platoon shit
Welcome to Detroit, welcome back to the unit
Jay Dee said get 'em, nigga you getting bullwhipped
Set yourself to fall in love, nigga get poolsticked
Rest of your sins baptized in the pulpit
Dilla donuts get worldwide spins
Hundred percent Jay Dee, no Dilla pretend
Try to duplicate the trend, hope that Jay Dee'll send
All you Dilla stealing niggas, here's Jay Dee's revenge

[Hook]
If you could make music for the world, who would you be?
How would it sound? How would it feel?
Would it make you think of Motown and the heart that pound
The beat in the street, Dillatroit this is 313
(Repeat x2)

[Verse 2: Nick Speed]
Rebirth motown, reassemble, recharge, recorded, relit, rekindled
I'm known to see different, you glow and we glisten
Breathe the scent and represent
Get choked for remixing, ego, we divided
I just washed the seam to the skull he provided
It's all in the news, you can go read about it
The more people hear Jay, the more he deposit
Hey Jay, they trying to eat off your name
Doing new things and it ain't even the same
The king with a board, they trying to figure you out
Start with a dream and then you invent a new route
Uh, it's powerful how it came together
Hit record in the zone and it stay forever
Timeless, I see it day and night
Everybody leave, then they coming back trying to make it right
Ecstasy and pain, ultra hard, dramatical
We bogart a attitude, old scars get tatted too
Come from the Hart Plaza, murder car capital
Broken dream boulevard, heard it all avenue

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Guilty Simpson]
A new beginning, focused on the dime in the year
It's no ending, things never seemed so clear
I take a second reflecting on the way stuff was
Was it hate, or was they giving me tough love
I don't know, still it made me who I am
Now I'm back, ready to pursue my plan
And now I'm back, ready to renew my stance
And like that, a nigga feeling new again, uh
Yeah and I'm right back on it
I'm living the dream with some nightmare moments, uh
But everybody has a story in the skyscraper of a building called glory
What's yours?
My music allows me to touch yours
Get called out for encores
Tell me, should I wan't more?
Of course I should, that's what I'm so charged for

[Hook]Ladies and gentleman
Ladies and gentleman
Ladies and gentleman
Are you really ready for some super dynamite soul?

[Verse 1: Guilty Simpson]
I body tracks with a brutal approach flying coach
First class when I'm dropping shit I wrote
Convert cash in airports and splurge on whatever I desire
The lead writer, I street fight ya, ya'll play Street Fighter
Big difference, miles apart, styles is darts
On point I parallel park on street cats
Feed your back a knife, a reckless [?]
Watch your tone around here
Even kingpins get dethroned around here
They don't give a fuck about what they buck buck
Bring me the truck tucked and sleep with tough luck
Harsh reality, spark the Cali tree
In the motor city where they chart fatalities
B-boy stance the place
Cause the poppers gonna pop, the breakers gonna break

[Verse 2: Rass Kass]
I'm one of the depressed children, top billing
If skills would pay the bills I'm worth at least a hundred million
A lot of rappers be illin', hit 'em with the dealing
Turn an overnight villain, catch a case and start squealing
I'm standing on a square like a slice of Sicilian
Afghan vet killing, fucked like the debt ceiling
I treat crabs like my red-haired step children
Slap 'em around, fuck they moms with my sex healing
Word to Marvin Gaye
I put the same gun you bought me to your chest and blow you away
Pause, period periodically delirious
FM radio is wack so I usually bump Serius
Effect the Gucci belts microphone plug
Makes me not very likable
Make all the bitches fight like my dick'll do
Walk into the booth with a mouth full of pick to chews

[Verse 3: Fashawn]
I'll tell you something that you need to learn
You ain't seen beef 'til you seen an urn
If it ain't about money why would I be concerned
If not my Coheeba burn
Yes, flicking ashes on my adversaries
Got a list of maggots that I'd be glad to bury
I used to burn chronic out of bible papers
Street disciple ripping pages out the Book of David
Over the stove with the recipe
Chef Boyar-G flow effortlessly
Your punchlines couldn't make an eye swell
You ain't Mike Jordan you Montell
Silly you for thinking you missle-proof
Now I'm just positioning my pistol to hit your troops
I bridge the gap like a dentist
Reinvented the reinvented, no limit so independent
And I gotta be the villain, I'm probably just a minute
Here's the middle finger case any got offended
Llama in the linen, vodka in my system
Prada with my hands that pray that the father forgive this
Rhyme schemes like mescalin to the fiends
Nothing coming between my regime, naw mean

[Verse 4: Skyzoo]
The menage of a kick and a snare
Between that a mirage for the vision-impaired
I'm in a league where the stars can't fit in they chairs
So when I speak I barrage whoever sittin' in there
The armrest turned conquest, I'm just here to Contra the compress
Automatic concrete your congress
A sixteen sound like I was drumming out
We just trying the Upper Eastside and take the Drummond route
Know me in the building for the walls that be jumping out
I be on my Willis if Janet try and come around
Singing Mo Money, I'm singing Mo Money
Harmony hundreds couldn't get a note from me
Regardless we're on it there's nothing like 'em that be on
The bargain they wanted just walked 'em right into the norm
I loop 'em up a song, open up the beat and
Then name somebody doper than the dope you get from me
And holler when you think of 'em

[Scratching]
From the soul ya'll
Soul
Dynamite soul[Verse 1: Sean Price]
Listen, everybody love a star
Every chick want a nigga fresh dip, pushin' a car
Everybody wanna fight the power, light the powder
Sean Price for President, Eisenhower
Everybody want to rap the best, scrap the best
Clap the sket, Steven Seagal snap your neck
Everybody know Jesus is black
Everybody know the trigger finger is used to squeeze the gat
Everybody know gas is high, pass the la
Stash the crack when the cops come passing by
Everybody wanna act so cool, like a jazz musician
Grow cancer from a pack of Kools
Everybody wanna sign to Koch, seven dollars a record
Stop lying, you ain't getting that guap'
Everybody want a beat from Black, and a verse from Guilt
Everybody hating, wanting me killed, P

[Verse 2: Black Milk]
Nobody wanna be at the bottom
Broke barely making it, niggas not making no dollars
So you wanna be on top of
The world watching a ho topless on top of your
Niggas wanna be the tough guy and hold steel
Cause nobody wants to be weak and show fear
That's why most niggas get killed, but
Nobody wants to feel the bullet when the guns spill
Feel them handcuffs, get put away for months
But, that's what nobody wants
Bein' done in the pen, right to the end
But nobody wants to see life come to an end, nah
Nobody wants to see their time gone and
Nobody likes when their high's blown
No hoes, no riches, don't have no shine
Nobody wanna be that guy, no

[Verse 3: Guilty Simpson]
Somebody needs to take the blame
These dudes throwin' rent money up just to make it rain
Fronting for a broad that don't even care about them
She don't even love herself, she fuck for wealth
Looking for a man she feels is somebody
So she can feel that she's somebody
Braindead, but give great head
With a sassy mouth, at the club, whole ass is out
Somebody's gon' holler, pay to fuck, probably
I won't lie, the chick got some body
Nice ass and tits, she got one hobby, money
Catch her in the hotel lobby
Looking for somebody, to spend cash
Big ass finds out where the bricks stashed
You'll need at least one shotty
It'll be a John Doe when they find some body[Intro: Black Milk]
Elzhi, Black Milk, let's go, yeah

[Verse 1: Black Milk]
You can't mention the top five without mentioning I
Black and Elzhi, fire like the temperature rise
Limitless I'm, not even the sky's the limit to I
When we spit with adrenaline times ten
From the beginnin until the rhyme end
It's, no stopping, every line's mind boggling
Stopping your top artist, topping 'em
When we spit sick, naw critics love to get compliments, go

[Verse 2: Fatt Father]
A little 'gen and sodium
Pandemonium, sparks the fat man at the podium
Starts the flame on, I came to stay long
(Somebody call SVU!) I rape songs
Fatt Father collaring fake bums, like Steak-umms
With great guns, that'll have you covered in A1
Al Green told me I was hotter than cooked grits
And my words seem more like somethin I cook with

[Hook: Black Milk]
Cause it's that fire, I see the smoke rising higher
Hi-higher, hands to the sky, up
Spit fire, nope can't deny us
They getting liver, cause it's that fire
I see the smoke rising higher
Get 'em, get 'em up, get 'em higher
Get a cup, let me see, see you light up
They getting liver, cause it's that fire

[Verse 3: Danny Brown]
I fire up the blunt and it tastes like gumbo
Hit the trees hard like George in the Jungle
I'm a play humble 'fore I let the K rumble
Know you got a bitch fatty and a snitchin ass uncle
Brown play niggas like Funco-
Land tan seats in the old school sedan
So nigga talk sweet and the forty fifth blam
Hit a nigga in his back, make 'em do a handstand

[Verse 4: Fat Ray]
Look, it's Fat Ray, fireman, I'm turnin the hose on
You fire up a L, we burning the whole zone
So you can go to hell with fire and brimstone
Fire with the heckler
Niggas is even jockin my hand gestures
Yes, cause I'm fresher than the Nantucket Nectar
Ain't a man fresher, we apply pressure
You a lie, crooked in the street, when I fire like a Vietnam veteran

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Guilty Simpson]
You can't extinguish my genius, release just
Enough to touch y'all without a just cause
And still build a loyal following
Front row at my next show hollering, witnessing overpowering
Lyrics, you feel it deep down, way beneath the street's ground
In sewer tops, we do enough, you do a lot
With zero reward, I'm the chairman of the board
Warlord, sending verb victims to the morgue

[Verse 6: Elzhi]
'til charge an ill joggin, with skill that can kill squadrons
We'll reveal this all in your grill, like the drill sergeant
Too mean, two spleens, this is daily routine
If you seen, holding new green, in my blue jeans
Knuckle every clown, always chuckle, barely frown
Pistol here beneath the bubble, like Huckleberry Hound
When I came in, bent down to strike the game and
They say that I'm fire, you just got fired for soundin like your flaming

[Hook]

[Outro: Black Milk]
If you a fan, go and fan a nigga off, yeah
Wave your hands, yeah, fan a nigga off, uh
Go ahead, just fan a nigga off, yeah
If you a fan, go and fan a nigga off, go![Verse 1: Guilty Simpson]
I'm a fugitive running from my past
How long will freedom last
I'm swinging knuckles of brass
Motivated, hustle for cash
I'm puffing the hash
Leave a rapper on the ground with his jugular slashed
And laugh at him, it's humorous
A lot of emcees got one style, me I got numerous
I stand out so nobody's confusing us
I'm way better, cold winners, beige leathers
Black pistols, red eyes, blue jeans
White widow, caked up, new green
Travel across borders, across water
Being short on my cashflow is a tall order
Your style shallow like fountains where they toss quarters
Wishing away to be the pick of the day
When motherfuckers would care to hear the shit that you say
On show day you couldn't give the tickets away
Lose lose

[Verse 2: MED]
I step through the door
Sharper than a blade from a mower
Success, you more like the pitch of a four
What a mess
I ain't gotta brag when I double cash
Come easy like a breezy with a treble pass
Still by popular demand
Return like a shirt when you wore it with a tag
Still clown in the C-U-T
Eyes low, Tae Bo, no S-U-V
CA to the D what up, talk shit
The shoe fit, equipped, get your toungue shoestring, damn
Stay sound as I crack jaws
You lock doors, we break through the bores in the drywall
By far we a highlight
You an extra, catch shade from the spotlight, right
No pressure, respect, just the best
To headline the field like rent from your next check
M.E.DGood shit...

[Guilty Simpson]
Crack, E, Powder, Weed
No matter what it is they got what you need
Young cats serving bags from ten speeds
I guess money does grow on trees
Kush, Gas, Dro, and Regs
Drop a few crumbs for the hoes to beg
You better learn the game and know the ledge
Dudes round here put holes in heads
Got cash to blow
Dog got ziplock bags of snow
And those that keep E work is swoll
Chicks pop them hoes like birth control
The whole game is buy and sell
Keep the clientele high as hell
Some dudes jump in, try, and fail
Get locked up and tell...

(Hook)
All the hustlas
Let me see your foot work
Them young boys around the corner got purp
Right next door where homie got murked
When he met dude, he copped and got jerked
Let me see your foot work/
Don't go down the street, they got dirt
Right next door where the girl got murked
When she ain't do old boy, he got hurt

[Guilty Simpson]
Shrooms, Cigs, Meth, and Hash
Whatever's gon get that extra cash
A1 products in sandwich bags
Plate so fat they can't be mad
Rain, hail, snow, or sun
The whole neighborhood got the 411
If you snitch they'll bust a gun
Stomp on your face and bust yo gums
You better ask around
Them drug boys sewed up half the town
Fearless, ain't no backing down
The whole crew's packing pounds
Ones that you smoke and ones that smoke you
And everyone knows who you should go to
But you need someone to go through
Don't knock if they don't know you...

(Hook)Verse 1: Guilty Simpson
I hear a lot of false prophecies, about a lotta emcees
Philosophies about these fake Socrates
Not to be a hater, but he ain't the savior
I got too many layers, the games got way too many players
So I slay another rapper, and put 'em on the mantle
You lookin' but I'm on another channel
Watchin' these sambos puttin' on a show for their handlers
Lyin' to the people for the cameras
Amateur night, these clowns can't damage a mic
So I'm breakin' off the hand that they write with
I might sh*t, real weed here takes flight with
The price gets better when you bring more cheddar
I fight clips, with the strength of the men
I'm pissin'' from the ? to the ?, so send 'em in
Your style is cinnamon
Way to sweet for the streets to be listening' in Michigan

Hook 1: The Rockness Monstah
Hey you a b*tch ni**a
That's right I said it, you a b*tch ni**a (word)
You be runnin' round with all types of snitch ni**as
I can't mix wicha, you and your inner bitcha
Yah you, you a b*tch ni**a
Fat b*tch a** ni**a, rub on ya' t*ts ni**a
You one of them side switch ni**as (uh huh, uh huh)
I can't mix wicha b*tch ni**as

Verse 2: The Rockness Montsah
Rock not the LL Cool J "I need Love"
More like the LL, smoke two J's, I need drugs
Addict behavior, ran out & I'm agg-ravated
Y'all rappin' this lame shit, I feel like clappin' the stage up
No applause and no remorse for rappers that's claimin' they got bars
No dem is bras. I laugh in their faces. bitch boy
F*ck u threw some D's on it? Rich Boy
How those pants tight & they saggin' you sh*t in your draws, didn't you?
I will make you break dance on your face scrams
Capoeira, slap you hella hard, probably sprain my hand (splocka)
You snakes can't hide in my grass
Ain't no grass in the PJs, I smoke mine in a wrap
I don't drink fruit ni**a I punch fruits
Put' generations of little bangers through huntin' school
I don't wanna do sh*t wicha
Ol' Lifetime channel watchin' butter milk bath takin' b*tch ni**a

Hook 2: The Rockness Monstah
Hey you a b*tch ni**a
That's right I said it, you a b*tch ni**a (word)
You be runnin' round with all types of snitch ni**as
I can't mix wicha, you and your inner bitcha
Yah you, you a b*tch ni**a
Fat b*tch a** ni**a, rub on ya' t*ts ni**a
You one of them side switch ni**as (uh huh, uh huh)
I can't mix wicha b*tch ni**as[Guilty Simpson]
I remember when it all started
A young cat, trynta get her trust back
Cause me and my momma,we hit a rough patch
Searching my room like "Where there drugs at?"
She didn't find em'
But found a heater in my coat lining
This is way before rhyming
When I had a dead fear for all the old timers
Earning stripes on the streets without a co-signer
She askin' why I couldn't say
It seems I was breaking her heart every other day
I needed another way
Witnessing my peers bubble yay making double pay
Tucking the clock cleaner for block schemers
Because if you're rocking high sneakers,they might rob ya
Every day inner city problems
I used to wish my parents chose a condom
Life was a gift I never asked for
Me and reality had a crash course
We used to jump and slap the backboard
Before the studio life and rap tours
I counted scars way before I counted bars
Grew up quick dealing with a screwed up chick
Who, what, when, why, where and how?
Hittin licks like crime pays for now
Skinny bird chest youngin and living foul
Winging it on talent,still fly
Sore attitude I jumped and got high
Enjoying the view
Knowing something is important to do
But all I was was a fan then
I didn't have that understanding
I wasn't a man then
Not even close
Then I recited a rhyme I wrote
Grim life found hope
Stupid me noticed opportunity to keep me far from broke
So I tried rhyming in my homeboys ride
Pontiac 6000 rolling up freestyling
Years later, admiring the dough we piling
Where the come up?
Getting my ones up
I used to hit the studio with a gun tucked
You never know when life imitates art
Better then to role play when the game starts
I'm a team captain
Making dreams happen
Jotting words at lunch, go home and read napkins
Now [?] feeds me
Story of G[Intro]
Life itself full of struggle and wealth
Yeah, Guilty Simpson, muthafuckas
Let's go, Detroit city

[Verse 1]
We bangin' that jungle music
Homies in the hood flip bundles to it
Make exchanges to flake for wages
Hustlin' hard before the jake engages
They wanna see the apes in cages
We never conversate with agents
Anti-police to speak in layman's
I'd rather take a swim with Cayman
For real, man, fuck 'em all
That's why I flick off cops and cuff my balls
Smokin' that good shit
Your baby mama wanna fuck with that hood shit
And I'm just what she need, a gangsta breed
Yeah, break down my weed, fuck and leave
You niggas wanna buck with G's, bitch please
I seen harder kids in a Chuck E Cheese

[Hook]
Party with the baddest broads and spend change
Take 'em to the hotel suite and get brains
Gettin' bitches, gettin' riches
I'm a playa, but no, it's not a game
Outfit's crazy, watch's insane
Gettin' bitches, gettin' riches

[Verse 2]
We hustlin', don't confuse it
Money is the bread, hen dog's the fluid
Sold out stages, the love's outrageous
Swoosh on the A-1's match the laces
They wanna see the crew with cases
They tell me that I'm too abrasive
Unseen, we move evasive
We don't follow rules, we take it
And I only trust my dogs
Y'all fake that's why I don't fuck with y'all
I'm tryin' to get hood rich
So miss me with all of that bullshit
For this here I bleed, yes indeed
I'm tryin' to cop a black Range and have extra cheese
Y'all wanna test me, please bitch squeeze
I ain't hard to find man, I'm in the D

[Hook]
