[Hook]
They see me rolling
They hating, patrolling and trying to catch me riding dirty
Trying to catch me riding dirty
My music so loud I'm swangin'
They hoping that they gonna catch me riding dirty
Trying to catch me riding dirty

[Verse 1 - Chamillionaire]
Grinding to see if they can see me lean
I'm tint, so it ain't easy to be seen
Police see me ride by they can see me gleam
And my shine on the deck and the TV screen
And ride with a new chick, she like "Hold up"
Next to the PlayStation controller
It's a full clip in my pistola
Send a jacker into a coma
Girl, you ain't know, I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone
Just trying to bone, ain't trying to have no babies
Ride clean as hell so I pull in ladies
Law's on patrol and you know they hate me
Music turned all the way up into the maximum
I got speakers, some niggas trying to jack for some
But we packing something and what we have for em
We'll have a nigga locked up in a maximum security cell
I'm gripping oak
Music loud and I'm tipping slow
Twin's steady twisting like "Hit this dough"
Police pull up right behind and it's in his throat
Windows down, got to stop pollution
CD changes, niggas like, "Who is that producing?"
That's the Play N Skillz when we out and cruising
Got warrants in every city except Houston
But I still ain't losin'

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Krayzie Bone]
I've been drinking and smoking, holy shit cause I really can't focus
I gotta get it home before the po-po's scope this
Big old Excursion just swervin', all up in the curb'n
A nigga be sipping on the Hennessy and the gin again
It's in again, we in the wind
Doin' a hundred while I puff on a blunt
And roll another one up, we living like we ain't giving a fuck
I got a blunt up in my right hand
40-ounce in my lap freezing my balls
Roll another tree, green leaves and all
Coming pretty deep, me and my dogs
Yo I gotta hit the back streets
Wondering about the 6 pounds and I got heat
Glock, Glock shots to the block, we creep-creep
Pop-pop, hope cops don't see me on the low key
With no regard for the law
We dodge em like: "Fuck em all"
But I won't get caught up and brought up
On charges for none of y'all
Keep a gun in car and a blunt to spark
Roll it up if you want, nigga, get it poppin', dogg
Ready or not, we bust shots off in the air
Krayzie Bone and Chamillionaire (Millionaire)

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Chamillionaire]
Now would you think it so? I tried to let you go
Turn on my blinker light and then I swang it slow
And they upset for sho', cause they think they know
That they catching me with plenty of the drank and dro
So they get behind me, trying to check my tags
Look in my rear view and they smiling
Thinking they'll catch me in the wrong, they keep trying
Steady denying that it's racial profiling
Houston, Texas you can check my tags
Pull me over, try to check my slab
Glove compartment, gotta get my cash
Cause the crooked cops'll try to come up fast
And being the baller that I am, I talk to them giving a
Damn about them not feeling my attitude
When they realize I ain't even riding dirty
Bet you'll be leaving with an even madder mood
I'mma laugh at you and then I'll have to cruise
Yea, my #2 on some old-school DJ Screw
You can't arrest me, plus you can't sue
This is a message to the law, telling em: "We hate you"
I can't be touched and tell em that they should've known
Tipping down, I'm sitting crooked on my chrome
Booking my phone, finding a chick I want to bone
Like they couldn't stop me
I'm bout to pull up at your home, and it's on[Intro: Krayzie Bone]
Yeah, Kray Jackson
In the building right now, real smokey
With my lil nephew, Dizzy Wright (Wright, Wright)
Yeah, y'all know, we been doin' this man

[Hook: Dizzy Wright & Krayzie Bone]

You tryna get this high? Little nigga I doubt it
Don't you ever forget

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Krayzie Bone]
I'm in my state of awareness, right now (right now, right now)
I can feel it so you know that clearly I'm high (I'm high, I'm high)
Split another swisher, keep it rollin'
Keep it rollin', keep it rollin'
Keep it rollin', keep it-
Split another swisher, keep it rollin'
Keep it rollin', keep it rollin'
Keep it rollin', keep it-
Mildly heat it, mildly heat it, mildly heat it
Hold it in until you get to chokin'
Blow it out and see how high you go (go, go, go, go)
When I be wingin', let us kill a bitch of hittin'
Cause we only twistin' sticky buddah
Potent dro (potent dro)
Out of my mind, that's how I like it
So like this, I'm (up, up)
But you need Bob Marley lungs
I hope you got some Bob Marley lungs (lungs, lungs)

[Hook]

(Smokin')
(Smokin')[Intro]
We scoured the globe on a quest to find the most elite
Most intricate tongues of all time
California, New York, Denmark, Australia
Then a cold wind from the Midwest brought the hardest
Fastest, most accurate tongues ever heard in our lifetime
These are the Midwest Choppers

[Verse 1: K-Dean]
I got a message for any one of you muthafuckin niggas
That wanna talk 'bout the Mid-Midwest
We dangerous, Aim to bust any little nigga with a big-big chest
Anybody that wanna be comin thinkin they hotter
I'm a type of nigga that'll really kill ya for dollas
Fuck everybody that want a piece of a killa
For real, Me and my niggas will leave you floatin in a river
So fuck all you haters, You heard what I said
My flow a little bit over your head
Act like a pencil, I'll fill you with led
If you afraid, Then tell me you scared
Cause I'mma little bit out of my muthafuckin mind
The hardest rapper that Tecca N9na could fuckin find
Who that? Who that? That's me
Who that? Who that? K-Dean
When I was comin up in the game everybody was tellin me
'I really be killin a lot of you niggas, I'm mean'
Fuckin with my niggas D-Loc and Dalima
They told me, 'I be really gotta be a muderer killin machine'
I didn't care about nothing but rappin my way to the top
Fuckin with my nigga Tech, cause I'm really hot
Anybody got a problem with any one of my niggas
I'll pulled out the 9 milli up to a pop
Bring the heat, Bring the noise, Bring the flames
Anything that you bring, I'mma tame
Puttin dirt on the top of my name
Pull back and I click-click, bang
Ask Tech, He'll tell you I'm strange
If you ever wanna talk about me
I'mma run up, Gun up and leave you with no brain
Then you'll know my flow is insane

[Hook]
I be on the West Coast, I be on the East Coast
I be North, South, but I reside on my side, Midwest Chopper
Even though I'm all up in the Northwest
All across the U.S
Overseas, Midwest Choppers

Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh (You can't touch us)
Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh (Yeah, Midwest Choppers)
Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh (You can't touch us)
Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh (Nigga, Midwest Choppers)

[Verse 2: Krayzie Bone]
Come, come get some of this
Midwest murda music, murda music, murda music
Come, come get some of this
Midwest murda music, murda music, murda music
Let me hit 'em
When I get 'em, I'mma split 'em, I'mma kill 'em
I'm the nigga with the lyrical venom finna get up in them
When they give me the instrumental
I finish 'em, diminish 'em
I guarantee the murda music is a minimum
But lately I been givin 'em hell
They don't really wanna see me, I'm servin' 'em swell
Call me a monster, Verse Designer, First To bomb ya
Leathaface pullin up in that hearse beside ya
Murda, mo murda, mo murda, mo murdered 'em all, kill 'em all
Krayzie kill 'em all, they fall
It's a lyrical execution
We snap faster, We the rap masters
Squeeze the gat, Blast it, If that's how it gots to be
So they better get it ready
Cause I'm heated like an AK-47 spittin bullet fuckin' lyrics out of me
Well that's somethin, That's crazy, Jackson
He's amazin action, Stay in action
Rap singin at ya, I'm blazin at ya
I'm kinda like an automatic aimin at ya
And I don't want a little bit of flame to ashes
You know you really truely insane to madness
You're never gonna find other niggas more scandalous
Than this Midwest blastin family

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
I am the definition of murda
The N9ne is now coming to serve ya
You're running but you can't go no furtha
Cause I'm running through you with no sign of inertia
Gimme the mic and I bet that you duck
It's what you betta do when I'm bussin
I be flippin, I'm incredible, Never get on my level
I'm a killa with the pedal to the medal
You're edible and ya death is so inevitable
I can take it to ya momma, Ya daddy, The back of a caddy
You cut up in the sack with a baggy and I wanna...
Take it out and make it patty
You gotta be patty
Cause that'll be bad if you decide to mad, Is you gonna?
You can listen to me and see I'm the nigga with the ammunition
I'm givin the livin a vision of death
Makin 'em sick and depressed
Cause I be givin everything
I'm a rebel and I'm still with the quick and the best
Makin 'em walk in the business
I get up in it to rip and diminish ya
Trip and I finish ya
Dig it, You really get me livid, I'm bout give it a pivot
I'mma stick it so we can differ to sinister
I be the chopper that got ya little boppers goin off us
Better not let me up on the premises
Cause I'm a doctor that's out for the shotaz when I brought ya
Be cautious never talk of this nemesis
We on top of the hill when it come to the skill
Other rappers are damn jokers
They be givin the people comedy
But the Tecca N9na misery shit is Bram Stoker

[Hook][Intro]
Notorious
Spit your game, talk your shit

Where Brooklyn at? Hey, King of New York B,I.G., Twista, Bone

[Hook: Notorious B.I.G.]
Spit your game, talk your shit
Grab your gat, call your clique
Squeeze your clip, hit the right one
Pass that weed I gotsta light one

[Verse 1: Notorious B.I.G.]
Armed and dangerous, ain't too many can bang with us
Straight up weed no angel dust, label us Notorious
Thug ass niggas that love to bust, it's strange to us
Y'all niggas be scrambling, gambling
Up in restaurants with mandolins, and violins
We just sitting here trying to win, trying not to sin
High off weed and lots of gin
So much smoke need oxygen, steadily counting them Benjamins
Nigga you should too, if you knew, what this game'll do to you
Been in this shit since ninety-two
Look at all the bullshit I been through
Sure caught beef with you know who
Fucked a few female stars or two
Nigga, blue light, nigga, move like Mike, shit
Not to be fucked with
Motherfucker better duck quick, cause
Me and my dogs love to buck shit
Fuck the luck shit, strictly aim
No aspirations to quit the game
Spit yo' game, talk yo' shit
Grab yo' gat, call yo' clique
Squeeze yo' clip, hit the right one
Pass that weed, I got to light one
All them niggas I got ta fight one
All them hoes I got ta like one
Our situation is a tight one
Whatcha gonna do, fight or run?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Twista and (Swizz Beatz)]
(Ladies and gentlemen, Twista)
Making money, living marvelous
In God we trust
Don't too many niggas wanna start with us
Got big guns in the cars with us
Bust at any motherfucker acting hard with us
They really wanna show you what a G.I.B
I'd rather be sipping Remy in V.I.P
We can hear the music and that'll be by me
Twista with the legendary nigga B.I.G
Brooklyn to K-Town, when you checking out the flow
You know it's gon' reign with persistence
Two legends on the same track, two different planes of existence
Let's get it cracking, I love to bust flows
Hit it from the back cause I love to fuck ho
Do it for the city, I love Chicago
Calico's bumping, I love to bust dough
You think you could spit on the mic like you Biggie and flow just as steady as I
Shit, it's real, you know you love em, you ain't got Ready To Die
Life After Death, give it to you however you want it nigga
Got it, they got ya, give it to you, however you want it nigga
Cause the shit it get deep
So I carry big heat
Screaming "come and get me"
Twista and Biggie on the Swizz Beat (Swizzie)
Free mils, I love to make one
All these cars, I love to ride one
All these hoes, I love to cut one
A tribute to Big, I love to bust one

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Krayzie Bone and (Swizz Beatz)]
(Them Bone boys is back! Them Bone boys is back! Let's go)
In the middle of it I'mma
Bring niggas more drama then they baby mamas
Nigga wanna battle I'mma bomb ya
One man, but attack like a pack of piranhas
Like terracotta, niggas always ready for the war
But they really don't wanna see a nigga though
We can get em in a minute then we finish with the venom of the rhythm of a nigga with a sick-o-flow
Doing it with Swizz, oh no!
You niggas is in some trouble
Somebody better call po-po, it's gonna be murder when I get to serving them verbally (Yeah!)
Nigga y'all heard of me
Wig splitter, killer nigga, word to me
And I'm classic like Bird and Magic with a tactic to snatch his rep back and stack some platinum
Dumping on them at random
With the bullets I brand them
Fitting to hold the game ransom, running up in your mansion, cash demanding, flashing cannons (Let's go)
Niggas ain't ready for this one cause I'm on a mission to get even better believe it
I'm heavily heated, it's easy to see me
If you want to see me, let that be the reason (C'mon, B.I.G.!)

[Hook]

[Outro: Swizz Beatz and (Krayzie Bone)]
(Notorious!)
You just heard the sounds of the King of New York
B.I.G. (B.I.G.)
There's only one crown[Intro: Krayzie Bone]
Imma let em know before we get too deep
I am the Beginning and the End
I am the light
I am the darkness
I am the life
I am the father
I'm the creator
I am the Alpha and the Omega
Lyrical messiah, Undertaker
So abide by the lord, abide by the lord

[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
Can’t nobody ever see the nigga when the nigga is original and touched down first
That means im hanging in just like Earving and
I can bring pain to haters like birth
Yall wanna do work?
I’m rippin up out of my shirt when im hearing this blasphemy
When they drop to their knees and they ask for rap to get better
They pray and they ask for me
(T he Almighty, Lyrical Mastermind)
Now that everybody try'na crowd around a nigga style, like a nigga style
While they hold the other down
All them really wanna try to run away with the sound, but they can't really go a mile (HEY)
Tell'em they can make it over this way if they really wanna end it on this day It’s they choice, put them to rest with the pitch of the voice (WRAAAH!!!) Monster focus of course
So I see it that they copy me, but all them niggas seem to do it really sloppily They can really only understand a part of me, they try to get the flow, but they can never get the harmony
Im like a magnet, I keep attracting rappers, it's in need of a master kinda like sensei
So let the bow their heads and begin to pray
And as you pray it's best you ask to be forgiven
Don't be foolish, don't be senseless thinking you can’t be the victim, You can die
Tell'em they better respect it and never forget where they got it from
Or we gon' come after them niggas with bloody, mo bloody mo redruM

Murda Mo, Murrrrda Mo
And I don't really give a fuck if niggas think im talkin ‘bout'em
Cus’ them niggas know that I can talk it plus I walk about it
Violent when I bark about it, Imma get the party started
Im the nigga did it while them other niggas thought about it
Everybody know me, niggas know that im all been about it
Never met the person whos the hardest, ‘cus im really hard
Try to go the distance, imma take'em just a little farther
Have my competition retreating and running for the border
Ring the alarms, cus it's time to drop bombs, cus all of my rhymes are highly uncommon
All them niggas thinking they grown, but I came and paused in my prime, it’s time to pay homage
Look at who they try to be the most, nigga put it down over seas, every coast
Im one of the realest MC’s that ever spoke, im really like the bombest weed they ever smoked (DOPE)
Even when I lean with it I, Im clean with it, I am the illest nigga niggas have seen with it, supreme with it
Yall dont really want it cus im in my zone, Originally original cus it's my own
Somebody better tell them that them other niggas faking and the really mistaken, nigga that that Bone
Sick of these so called rappers coming with watered down shit, foul shit
Somebody shouldve learned'em all that to never come around this with that clown shit
So I gotta show'em with a little bit of melody, there will never ever be another Thug N Harmony
Everybody do it now and it dont really bother me, cus they already knowing im the leader of the artistry
Real in the streets, I keeps it real in the booth
Yeah and even that 9 millimetre I carry, it still spits the truth
Nigga dont test me, im not an experiment, you curiosity may be innocent
But before you niggas try to run up on me, im an incredible, hell of a lyricist
And it's impeccable, they can never deny the sound, it's so respectable
Have you heard this scary deadly flow? thats the reason all them other niggas want to catch the Boat (Float on)
I been save you rapper from sinking ever since I came in the game
And it ain't only rappers, it even some singers thats singing like us when they sang
Even producers producing the beat with the double time making that bang
So why in the fuck is they acting like we ain't the reason that everything changed?
Way back in the days when we came from East 99, the beats they deny me
And really I never had to be away, cus they fell asleep on a giant
So I came back and showed'em that I was the chosen one and they should never defy it
Imma rock til the beat stop, imma make'em feel it when the beat drop
You better bring a cold drink cus the heat hot, Nigga yall better think cus we not
But we retaliate and the shit was Kray cus it was really Kray, keep it real what the fuck im supposed to say?
I fucks with Kanye
I fucks with Jay
I fucks with Lil Wayne
I fucks with Drake
I wanna have a menage, I fucks with Nicki
I wanna rob a couple rappers, I fucks with 50
The flow was out of control, so I fucks with Kendrick
I fucks with Mos Def, he fucks with lyrics
I fucks with Eminem
I fucks with T.I
I fucks with 2 Chainz (Hey)
I fucks with Nipsey
I fucks with Jeezy, but not with you Mane
And im fuckin with A$AP
Remember the matter remains that, I tell em that Leathaface still in this bitch and I stay hitting hard as a train wreck
What a minute, you probably thought I was finished
With me it’s never an ending
The killer make sure you stay dead
This killer flow that be the gimmick
The illest of any minute
The realest, so many feel it
The lyrics really authentic
So potent that when you get it, you cough or choke when you hear it
Im knowing them niggas fearing, cus i got up in their spirit
I told them niggas in the beginning that Imma kill'em with 2000 words in 2 minutes (PIN IT)
Who that nigga running with the AK-47 packing pumps like it fit through us and 357
HEAT, so heated heavy that these competitors are never ready
Im like a disease, I keep spreading
I hittem like a headache or a migraine, watch a nigga die in the flames when I set it. (deadly)
Burn them to Hades, ain't non’ them met Krayzie, ain't never afraid (WHO SCARED?!)
Rocking like a real rapper, then I put a little Jodeci in it and say "Ooh Yeah!!“
I never wanna be a star, I rather kick it with the real niggas
Chillin with the field niggas
Get that dollar bill nigga
If I got to kill niggas, then you really finna meet this steel nigga
Coming ‘round the corner with the gun and you’re a goner
Cus im more than a performance, sending rappers to the coroner
So I give'em all a warning when you see a nigga stomping, coming at you with an attitude, all you gotta do is salute![Introduction: Krayzie Bone]
Nigga the mission's to get what you don't got
The struggle it don't stop, until we drop

[Ice Cube] Krayzie Bone and Ice Cube..
The best thing in life in life is life (uh-huh, uh-huh)
Get your mind right, and get your grind right (we gotta keep goin)
[Krazyie] Hey young thugs (we gotta keep goin)
Get your mind right, and get your grind right
[Krazyie] Hey young thugs..
Get your mind right, and get your grind right

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
Look into my eyes if you wanna know me
Before you hypnotized, homey what do you see
A figure that's just a little bigger than dealers
A hustler countin figures ain't pulled no triggers
Can you dig us, we be the ultimate lick
We's the hitters, that make the ultimate hits
Kinda floss-ey, kinda boss-ey
It's gotta be done my way, do what the {fuck} I say
Top of the pyramid, homey what I tell you
If you leave this Westside umbrella you hit the cellar
Bring me my slippers, black robe, and my globe
And I could rule the world with my eyes closed
(with my eyes closed..)

[Hook x2: Krayzie Bone]
See the mission's to get what we don't got
Until we filthy rich and on top
You betta go get it, it's yours
Nigga the mission's to get what you don't got
The struggle it don't stop until we drop
[Ice Cube] Krazyie Bone and Ice Cube

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
To all the little homies that's watchin TV
I see you tryin to be a O.G. like me
Chasin dreams, pullin mo' schemes for wealth
But the best thing in life is health, be yourself playa
Television it'll keep yo' ass wishin forever
You'll never get you life together
Don't talk about death, I got too much life to live
Too many orders to give -- what it is, showbiz
Taught you what a trick and a ho is (WHAT?)
Showed you what a Six-ty Fo' is (WHAT?)
Lord knows, "In God We Trust"
And everybody in the world wanna be like us (everybody)

Chorus

[Verse 3: Ice Cube]
To the kids of the world that's waitin for wealth
Waitin for health, you better do for self
Homey that's yo' last cup
Forget about the fast buck; boy, get you ass up
People use yo' brain to gain
Do something that ain't never been done; and we can spend hun's
Wipe our ass with twenties, light our joints with ones
Throw away the guns, have nuttin but fun
And homey we could do that {shit}!
Police have a fit, when yo' paper's legit
We gotta get off the phone, we gotta teach our own
Send your baby to school and she'll come back grown
We got to talk to our grandma's
And she'll help us through them dark halls, and them pitfalls
Everybody know we got the world to gain
We got to stop the pain, lord stop the rain

Chorus

[Outro: Ice Cube]
Keep goin, little homey why you slowin?
Keep rollin, little homey why you slowin?
Keep rollin, little homey why you slowin?
Keep rollin, rollin, rollin, rollin

[Outro 2: Krayzie Bone]
Hey young thugs, the world is yours..
Hey young thugs, the world is yours..
Hey young thugs, the world is yours..
Yeah young thug, the world is yours..
Hey young thugs, the world is yours..
Hey young thugs, the world is yours..
Hey young thugs, the world is yours..

Yeah young thug, the world is yours..
Hey young thugs, the world is yours.. (Ice Cube..)
Hey young thugs, the world is yours..
(the best thing in life is life)
Hey young thugs, the world is yours..
(I got to say it twice)
Yeah young thug, the world is yours..

Hey young thugs, the world is yours..
(get your mind right, and get your grind right)
Hey young thugs, the world is yours..
Hey young thugs, the world is yours..
Yeah young thug, the world is yours..[Hook]
Somebody tell me please if what I speak is obsolete
How come so many find there shine? I bet they copy me
On another level so I take them to the other side
Somebody tell me please if what I speak is obsolete
How come so many find there shine? I bet they copy me
On another level so I take them to the other side

[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
How many times I gotta tell em, I’m slick with the letter
There’s nobody better than I
The game is sick so I come with a medicine vibe
True artists they never can die
I look and they fiending for some of this crazy Jackson
Like I did good dope
Who in the hell say Kray ain't actor?
Better go and ask 'em, niggas in there hood know
Niggas in there hood know me
I’m the lyrical criminal murder the track that's a homicide
Everybody track killer, I'mma ride
So lower the beat if it's down to die
The game, the way that you long for this
And the clones that's FEDing me wrong I guess
With time, look at how strong I get
Been in depth 20 years ain’t burn out yet
But I still get niggas that can't keep up with the flow
With a nigga flow, got 'em on there rose
So I got 'em on a choke hold, lone niggas that's like your popo
And that’s without solo, go low
I hit a nigga then the beef done built
But turned right up in here and got dealt with
Nigga the message: This rap game I'm a ruler
How much a rap I should present?
Vow with a genius in your presence
Style to represent the living legend
Of the crown that never hasn't left me
Cause the town no longer represent me
When I'm dead and gone, my skeleton sit on the throne
Clinching a microphone, destined to shine since I was born
Defines the mind of a wilder storm

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Krayzie Bone]
They told me they wanna hear music
They really ain’t tripping on none of my
Dramas, man
Besides it’s profit to make and dollars to rake and I like Ben franks
Cause I love my music my creative juices run like fluid
Kind of like Nike shoes I just do it
Flow so fluid don’t even take effort to do it
My lesson to students: Never out shine their master
If trill, but don't switch to the path of differ
Different than any rapper
I'm hotter than hell but cold as Alaska
Christ speaks chapters the verse can't hold me no mo'
When I get in to my mornings flow mo'
When the niggas off the road they so slow
Get up in a niggas soul but I'm no ghost
Ride up in them, the rhythm is about their demise
So niggas duck get to splitting and divide
If there a cue in divine they get a sign
Hit them in they mind, get me through the grind
So I muscle the hustle, about them no more problems
In fact when I come through I dodge them
Real laid back nigga I squab them
Whether the brain, Kray is a monster
Don't need a sponsor, I’mma present myself Obama
Yes we can say yes
So sick with it all I can seek is my vicious death
And it ain't no sleeping myself
My illness is contagious, I’m infecting them young like rabies
I’m an epidemic, I’m outrageous
Keep on flipping niggas, I got pages what you wanna do?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Krayzie Bone]
Still in the race, I’m maintaining my lead
Call me speedy Gonzales, I come with the speed
Like 'andele, arriba'
The nigga was like concentrate believer
A beast a monster severs the reverends
Competitive spell, and came to do damage
Last man standing, microphone bandit
Niggas can't stand it that's why I brand it
Man its still Bone Thugs and Harmony
And all my fans still feeling for all the BTHUT
And if they feeling let in more though
No less I might get rammers in a porno
You think they get winded, if you want to contend
There's a strip for ten men
When it comes to the pen like oozing
And anybody do it against me don't win
So think about it don't run against me no sin
Looking at the man bitch I wonder where your mob is
Take it as a hint and put him on a wood
Then knock him then work on your flesh like I'm desperate and fresh out the hood
A bastard style nobody had this
In the prison and if I'm the baddest, illest, the maddest
Lyrically certified ain't to many niggas that ain't heard of mine
With the perfect rhyme by the time I can finish is curtain time
I rap but I stay on a dirty grind with my murderous vibe
I'll murk your minds search and find
Reject of a railroad and I fly by like hot metal
Got a million bitches single
So I'm coming fellow, foot on the pedal lets go

[Hook][Intro: Krayzie bone]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I know what I'mma call this one
24/7 the grinder, the grinder, the grinder (let's go)
Kray jack ya boss
24/7 the grinder, the grinder, the grinder
U know what I'm sayin? y'all gonna feel me on this one
24/7 the grinder, the grinder, the grinder
I'm always on the grind man, never sleep, hardly eat, for real
24/7 the grinder

[Verse 1: krayzie bone]
9 to 5 won't slow down til my money right
I'm tryna live a little with the sunny bright lights
And I admit a nigga loving quite nice
I'm addicted to living at a high price
So I'm tempted to risk it with my life
I'm straight through the day but then by night
I'm on the grind and my mind in the twilight
I go the hardest, comin' like a snarling bull when I'm charging
I'm come through like a street sweeper on these weak niggas game full of garbage
What did they accomplish? they can't do what I did
Somebody tell'em who I is, the wicked lyric professor
Soon to be back on the stretcher, its dead on arrival
The suspect is my flow
And its armed and its dangerous
And kind of hard to apprehend this
How raw my pen is, my harmonies a silent killer
Serial spitter, lyrical nigga
Figure they can sleep on me all they want
But when they awake and they see I was real
And leathaface still in the building
The swag is classic, kray jack's the baddest
Still on the block, I've done weighed two rocks
This product I got they can't wait to cop
Competitors they can't fade me now
If you don't got dope that krayzie got
Took over the spot now make it hot
Don't think I got soft cause the gauge is cocked
So hit some of this and go tell everybody I'm back
And the nigga is blazzing hot

[Hook]
If you got the dough I got the dope
Hit me up I got whatchu you need
If you tryna blow I got the dro
Hit me up I got whatchu need
If you got the dough I got the dope
Hit me up I got whatchu you need
If you tryna blow I got the dro
Hit me up I got whatchu need
Show your right
24/7 grinder
I'm always on my grind, on my grind, on my grind, on my grind
24/7 grinder
I'm always on my grind, on my grind, on my grind, grind, grind

[Verse 2: krayzie bone]
Everybody wanna get a brick of the good dope
So pure, so potent, so cold
Injection, make a nigga feel a little better
The popo still wanna know what I'm sellin'
So I tell em its daily medicine
All you need is a dose
And off you go
Into a zone you have never been
You can call it melodic marijuana
I call it heroin harmony
From Mr. dope man got the fiends still callin me
Every nigt, cause I'm 24/7 the grinder
I advertise, I gotta remind 'em
If you lookin for something a lil stronger
Then you know where to find us
Just follow your nose, nose, nose
It always know, know, know
You smell the dro inhale the blow, go tell some mo, mo, mo
We got some flotion potion thats gone fold you open up
We keep our smokin signal floatin in the air
So you know its us

[Hook]
If you got the dough I got the dope
Hit me up I got whatchu you need
If you tryna blow I got the dro
Hit me up I got whatchu need
If you got the dough I got the dope
Hit me up I got whatchu you need
If you tryna blow I got the dro
Hit me up I got whatchu need
Show your right
Yeah(yeah), yeah hustler, hustler(4X)

[Outro: krayzie bone]
I never sleep, (never sleep) I barely eat (barely eat)
I be so deep within' my thoughts it's pain to think (pain to think)
I won't rest(rest, rest), I don't stretch (stretch, stretch))
But maybe that's why I've got this sharp pain in my chair

See me on my grind(grind, grind)
Catch me on my grind(grind, grind)(Felicia)
Lately you've been stressin me, that's when I'mma give you some
Callin me, jockin me, sweatin me, gonna rush me none
Cuz when the time is right I'm gonna let you know and, that's for sure
So wait on me, patiently, and see what I got in store
I'm gonna represent, to the fullest of it and I promise you no regrets
Just put you trust in me, and baby, I promise this shit is legit (Legit
Legit, legit)

Chorus (2x): Felicia (Krayzie Bone)
It's all good (Yup, yup, yup, it's all G-double-O-D, good, good, good)
It's all good (Yup, yup, yup, it's all G-double-O-D, good, good, good, with
Me, with me, with me)

(Felicia)
If I told you once, then I told you twice, you've got to get to know me
There's more to a relationship, then jumpin in the sheets
And if that's all you want, then you better go, cuz that ain't me
I don't give me love to just anybody
If I'm not correct, then prove me wrong and, just hold on
Gradually you'll see, just how good it'll be
When the time is right, I'll ease your mind with a little bump and grind
Fantasies full of ecstasy, we'll have a real good time

Chorus

(Krayzie Bone)
Since it's all good baby, we can get it on
Hey, you wanna ride? Krayzie Bone
Come and jump in the Benz and tell your friends that you will get with them
Later
Come and let me take ya, got a couple of things I wanna show ya
I'm really tryin to know ya, I'm just curious
Is it really all good? You serious (I'm serious)
If it is, then I gotta jump on it, ride it, ghetto cowboy
Surprise, you thought I was quiet, I never was shy baby, niggas just act like
That
Lay back, but don't let that buddah rule ya, give that nigga the bag
Cuz we won't have time to talk
I've been peepin for a minute now (Yep, yep, yep) and I know just where I'mma
Start
Let me listen to your heart beat, boom boom
Racing intense situation, is it gettin kinda hot it here? No, that's you
Temperatures are rising, so am I

Chorus Til End[George Bush sample]
Weapons of mass destruction
Weapons of mass destruction

[Hook]
At last, we are in time
We're comin for the days of our last bread and wine (It's all in-It's all in time)
At last, we are in time
We're comin for the days of our last bread and wine (It's all in-It's all in time)
It's the end of the world
And still, people ain't got no satisfaction
It's the end of the world
And still, people ain't got no satisfaction

[Verse 1]
I'd rather be chillin in a casket-
Than livin in this madness
Feelin like a captive
In prison, like a savage
Depression from oppression
Meet they modern day slaves, US!
This system was designed to stay paid, off US!
These are the Signs of the Times, critical
Hard to deal with
Lately it's been hard to live with
Mama got laid off, papa got laid off
I gotta make it happen
Get it crackin, and get paid y'all
I'm just tryina survive
Stayin alive, it's do or die
And I ain't ready to die right now
Is it the end of the wooooorld?
Must be the end of the wooooorld
So doomed, so gloomy
So dark, so shocked, so truly
Refuse; to get the Mark of the Beast
Never walk with with the beast
Because you fall with the beast

[Hook]
At last, we are in time
We're comin for the days of our last bread and wine (It's all in-It's all in time)
At last, we are in time
We're comin for the days of our last bread and wine (It's all in-It's all in time)
It's the end of the world
And still, people ain't got no satisfaction
It's the end of the world
And still, people ain't got no satisfaction

[Verse 2]
It's been so long since we've been waiting on that better day
Cause we don't really wanna remember the yesterdays
Release the stress from my chest as I meditate
And pray to God, to try to help my find a better way
Stop! Everybody, what's that sound?
Gun-gun blasts as the shells hit the ground
Look what's going 'round
Livin in the ending in this, as we speak, it's ooover
It's the revealin of the Revelation
And of the Great Tribulation, so it's hate from the nation
Cause, Babylon will fall down
You better believe it's goin down
It's all in-It's all in time
Can't get no satisfaction
Temptation bring me mad distraction
No more Magog-gog-gog-Magog-gog-gog-gog

[Hook]
At last, we are in time
We're comin for the days of our last bread and wine (It's all in-It's all in time)
At last, we are in time
We're comin for the days of our last bread and wine (It's all in-It's all in time)
It's the end of the world
And still, people ain't got no satisfaction
It's the end of the world
And still, people ain't got no satisfaction

[Verse 3]
I'm lookin at the man in the mirror
And everything's clearer
Now I can see the bigger picture
One I envision through the scriptures
I don't wanna fall in your hinder
See that's the Second Death, you're never coming back
Once you wander in the tracks of the devil
You need to be keepin your eyes on your prize
Stayin better, tryina make it through these trying times
The level, stayin in line, and even if we die
Don't sweat it, just help your blessings and the Resurrection
The world's passing, along with assabets
And all this madness, soon will all vanish
Over (Over)
It's almost over (Over-over-over)
No more Magog-gog-gog-Magog-gog-gog-gog
No more Magog-gog-gog-Magog-gog-gog-gog

[Hook]
At last, we are in time
We comin for the days of our last bread and wine (It's all in-It's all in time)
At last, we are in time
We comin for the days of our last bread and wine (It's all in-It's all in time)
It's the end of the world
And still, people ain't got no satisfaction
It's the end of the world
And still, people ain't got no satisfaction[Hook]
Somebody tell me please if what I speak is obsolete
How come so many find there shine? I bet they copy me
On another level so I take them to the other side
Somebody tell me please if what I speak is obsolete
How come so many find there shine? I bet they copy me
On another level so I take them to the other side

[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
How many times I gotta tell em, I’m slick with the letter
There’s nobody better than I
The game is sick so I come with a medicine vibe
True artists they never can die
I look and they fiending for some of this crazy Jackson
Like I did good dope
Who in the hell say Kray ain't actor?
Better go and ask 'em, niggas in there hood know
Niggas in there hood know me
I’m the lyrical criminal murder the track that's a homicide
Everybody track killer, I'mma ride
So lower the beat if it's down to die
The game, the way that you long for this
And the clones that's FEDing me wrong I guess
With time, look at how strong I get
Been in depth 20 years ain’t burn out yet
But I still get niggas that can't keep up with the flow
With a nigga flow, got 'em on there rose
So I got 'em on a choke hold, lone niggas that's like your popo
And that’s without solo, go low
I hit a nigga then the beef done built
But turned right up in here and got dealt with
Nigga the message: This rap game I'm a ruler
How much a rap I should present?
Vow with a genius in your presence
Style to represent the living legend
Of the crown that never hasn't left me
Cause the town no longer represent me
When I'm dead and gone, my skeleton sit on the throne
Clinching a microphone, destined to shine since I was born
Defines the mind of a wilder storm

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Krayzie Bone]
They told me they wanna hear music
They really ain’t tripping on none of my
Dramas, man
Besides it’s profit to make and dollars to rake and I like Ben franks
Cause I love my music my creative juices run like fluid
Kind of like Nike shoes I just do it
Flow so fluid don’t even take effort to do it
My lesson to students: Never out shine their master
If trill, but don't switch to the path of differ
Different than any rapper
I'm hotter than hell but cold as Alaska
Christ speaks chapters the verse can't hold me no mo'
When I get in to my mornings flow mo'
When the niggas off the road they so slow
Get up in a niggas soul but I'm no ghost
Ride up in them, the rhythm is about their demise
So niggas duck get to splitting and divide
If there a cue in divine they get a sign
Hit them in they mind, get me through the grind
So I muscle the hustle, about them no more problems
In fact when I come through I dodge them
Real laid back nigga I squab them
Whether the brain, Kray is a monster
Don't need a sponsor, I’mma present myself Obama
Yes we can say yes
So sick with it all I can seek is my vicious death
And it ain't no sleeping myself
My illness is contagious, I’m infecting them young like rabies
I’m an epidemic, I’m outrageous
Keep on flipping niggas, I got pages what you wanna do?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Krayzie Bone]
Still in the race, I’m maintaining my lead
Call me speedy Gonzales, I come with the speed
Like 'andele, arriba'
The nigga was like concentrate believer
A beast a monster severs the reverends
Competitive spell, and came to do damage
Last man standing, microphone bandit
Niggas can't stand it that's why I brand it
Man its still Bone Thugs and Harmony
And all my fans still feeling for all the BTHUT
And if they feeling let in more though
No less I might get rammers in a porno
You think they get winded, if you want to contend
There's a strip for ten men
When it comes to the pen like oozing
And anybody do it against me don't win
So think about it don't run against me no sin
Looking at the man bitch I wonder where your mob is
Take it as a hint and put him on a wood
Then knock him then work on your flesh like I'm desperate and fresh out the hood
A bastard style nobody had this
In the prison and if I'm the baddest, illest, the maddest
Lyrically certified ain't to many niggas that ain't heard of mine
With the perfect rhyme by the time I can finish is curtain time
I rap but I stay on a dirty grind with my murderous vibe
I'll murk your minds search and find
Reject of a railroad and I fly by like hot metal
Got a million bitches single
So I'm coming fellow, foot on the pedal lets go

Armed and Dangerous x3

[Verse 1: Fortay]
I rep for western sydney, bitches can't contain there cunt
I spark the flame and puff, always armed and dangerous
I think it best you get me, or you might have a problem
Its hard to make enough, so i ain't never stopping
You aren't the same as us, im wasting counter money
Im adding up the figures, you cunts amount to nothing
I puff an ounce of something, you scraping up for cones
Got a problem with me, then make it fucking known
Save it cunt I'm grown, Ill say it like it is
Ain't no dolly done, i dont play with kids
You clame youre holding guns, well come and use em cunt

Armed and Dangerous x 3

[verse 3: Krayzie Bone]
Retaliation, wanna grab this mic, yall need to proceed with the evacuation
When i get the crack and niggas can't fathom, madness from master Krayzie
Jackson stab em, dag em, you the baddest? that just actuation, but i kill with a passion
Rappers clash in jail like clash a clay hem, niggas on they mind, put me on they line
Ain't never no computation, better come ready, coz all of my opposition are in a composition
Dont even let them get near me, let this place show the realest
So if you think you can deal me one, you should know that we kill for fun
Feel me son, i no i slow down, ill take it right now, the weapon is a steel me gun
Cleveland is the city we come from, so nigga we live to rum, kick the drum
Spit the blunt and hit you some, hit the pump and buck em a couple of verses
Never knew i could spit murder, captain got you dead man, pumped slumped your head man
Yes I'm the dead man, kill them all thats what i said man, when i let the bone know

[outro]
Armed and Dangerous x 3[Krayzie Bone] [Intro]
Break, breakdown, steady breaking me on down
Break, breakdown, steady breaking me on down
Break, breakdown, steady breaking me on down
Break, breakdown, steady breaking me on down

[Mariah Carey] [Verse 1]
You called yesterday
To basically say
That you care for me but
That you're just not in love
Immediately I pretended to be feeling similarly
And led you to believe I was OK
To just walk away from the one thing
That's unyielding and sacred to me

[Hook]
Well I guess I'm trying not to be nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind
Underneath the guise of smile gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel and I lie convincingly
Because I don't want to reveal the fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise till I go home at night
Then turn down all the lights and then I breakdown and cry

[Mariah Carey] [Verse 2]
So what do you do when somebody you're so devoted to
Suddenly just stops loving you and it seems they haven't got a clue
Of the pain that rejection is putting you through
Do you cling to your pride and sing "I Will Survive"
(Got to get control and roll roll roll on)
Do you lash out and say
How dare you leave this way
Do you hold on in vain as they as they just slip away

[Hook]

[Wish Bone]
Yeah, come on, yeah come on come on

[Mariah Carey] [Pre-Hook]
I'm going to breakdown

[Krayzie Bone] [Hook]
Break, breakdown
Got to get control and roll roll roll on
Steady breaking me on down
Got to get control and roll roll roll on

[Mariah Carey]
I'm going to breakdown

[Krayzie Bone]
Break, breakdown
Got to get control and roll roll roll on
Steady breaking me on down
Got to get control and roll on

[Wish Bone]
Going to break you down
Only if you let it
Everyday crazy situations rocking my mind
Trying to break me down
But I won't let it
Forget it (Forget it)

[Krayzie Bone]
I be feeling like your breaking me down
Kicking me around, stressing me out
I think you better go and get out
And let me release some stress (stress)

[Wish Bone]
Don't ever want to feel no pain (pain)
Hoping for the sun but it looks like rain (rain, rain, rain)
Lord, I just want to maintain

[Krayzie Bone]
Yeah, I'm feeling pressures you all
But nevertheless Krayzie won't fall
It's over, it's ending here (here)

Today a bullet in a clip hit your ass

Nigga you can get it if you axe for it
I can spit it in fast forward
{Screwed: *Or I can go in slower*}
Chop and screw it, have the whole Midwest rockin to it
Have the whole down South snappin to it
Get the whole East coast back into it, I'm the cat to do it
Whole West coast gon' bang to this
I do this for my niggas with 'cane to pitch
They never should have let me get the hang of this
Now I'mma spit game so dangerous
I'm amazin homes, I raise the chrome
Put the lazer on, then blaze the chrome
Better never fuck with Lazy Bone
Can't forget Wish and Krayzie Bone
And best believe that if you fuck with Eve I'm gonna kill you
I rep to the death, F to the S, man it don't get no realer

[Hook 2X: Bone Thugs-N-Harmony]

Leave you in a field in the Killa Califonia
Nigga make money, get money, big money
Casue when a motherfucker broke ain't shit funny - you can believe
Cash rule everything around me
So don't bring yo' broke ass around me
Spitter, nigga wig out, for the scrilla
Killer, dollar billa
In the middle of the drama

So drop it nigga this Cass' and Bone
Light up some hash and pass the chrome
Any nigga with a misunderstandin gon' get handled
And that's fo' sho'

[Wish Bone]
Nigga shut it down, we don't fuck around
If a nigga disrespect make him lay down
Used to get it in the street now I'm raised up
Nigga lay face ddown, nigga give me that shit
What I'm 'posed to do, when the niggas ride through
With his money, I want it
All I'm tryin to say is been doin this stuff
They fakers don't want it
Hit hard, droppin bodyguards
You don't want what's over here
Nigga better watch your broad, cause she'll tell it all
And we'll bring it over there
Nigga this Bone and Cass' who can fuck with that
If a nigga goes down, ain't nobody gon' rat
We know that, cut 'em all in the face
Whole camp on hush, that's always

[Hook]

I ain't askin twice, I never been that nice
Ho niggas been killed for a game of dice
He come sho't on the debt and he paid the price
Stayin at home with a safety light
But you chose to gamble, Mr. Rambo
Nigga like that get made example
I'mma tell you like a Biggie sample
Come short on the dough get your contract canceled
I'm up out first with pleny of ammo
This Full Surface nigga hard to handle
Nigga run up bet he get dismantled
Got him glued to the tube, can't change the channel

[Eve]
I was born to be a rich bitch
Can't ever block me from this dough
Nigga ridiculous
Yeah you see me, Hermes head to toe
You want to witness, you can't stop me, pop on the jet
Headed to Paris for a hour just to cop me a dress
You call it crazy, well I call it life
And I'm makin sure I'm all good
Nigga it's hard to rich, fuck broke
I remember that bein in the hood
And I ain't never goin back, fuck that
Got too much in life I want and need
Yeah you haters we love it and love it
Cassidy, Bone and Eve, yeah~!

[Hook]

[Outro]
Cassidy (E-V-E) and Bone Thugs
Cassidy (E-V-E) and Bone Thugs
Cassidy (E-V-E) and Bone Thugs
Cassidy (E-V-E) and Bone Thugs (HEY!)[Intro: Krayzie Bone]
Imma let em know before we get too deep
I am the Beginning and the End
I am the light
I am the darkness
I am the life
I am the father
I'm the creator
I am the Alpha and the Omega
Lyrical messiah, Undertaker
So abide by the lord, abide by the lord

[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
Can’t nobody ever see the nigga when the nigga is original and touched down first
That means im hanging in just like Earving and
I can bring pain to haters like birth
Yall wanna do work?
I’m rippin up out of my shirt when im hearing this blasphemy
When they drop to their knees and they ask for rap to get better
They pray and they ask for me
(T he Almighty, Lyrical Mastermind)
Now that everybody try'na crowd around a nigga style, like a nigga style
While they hold the other down
All them really wanna try to run away with the sound, but they can't really go a mile (HEY)
Tell'em they can make it over this way if they really wanna end it on this day It’s they choice, put them to rest with the pitch of the voice (WRAAAH!!!) Monster focus of course
So I see it that they copy me, but all them niggas seem to do it really sloppily They can really only understand a part of me, they try to get the flow, but they can never get the harmony
Im like a magnet, I keep attracting rappers, it's in need of a master kinda like sensei
So let the bow their heads and begin to pray
And as you pray it's best you ask to be forgiven
Don't be foolish, don't be senseless thinking you can’t be the victim, You can die
Tell'em they better respect it and never forget where they got it from
Or we gon' come after them niggas with bloody, mo bloody mo redruM

Murda Mo, Murrrrda Mo
And I don't really give a fuck if niggas think im talkin ‘bout'em
Cus’ them niggas know that I can talk it plus I walk about it
Violent when I bark about it, Imma get the party started
Im the nigga did it while them other niggas thought about it
Everybody know me, niggas know that im all been about it
Never met the person whos the hardest, ‘cus im really hard
Try to go the distance, imma take'em just a little farther
Have my competition retreating and running for the border
Ring the alarms, cus it's time to drop bombs, cus all of my rhymes are highly uncommon
All them niggas thinking they grown, but I came and paused in my prime, it’s time to pay homage
Look at who they try to be the most, nigga put it down over seas, every coast
Im one of the realest MC’s that ever spoke, im really like the bombest weed they ever smoked (DOPE)
Even when I lean with it I, Im clean with it, I am the illest nigga niggas have seen with it, supreme with it
Yall dont really want it cus im in my zone, Originally original cus it's my own
Somebody better tell them that them other niggas faking and the really mistaken, nigga that that Bone
Sick of these so called rappers coming with watered down shit, foul shit
Somebody shouldve learned'em all that to never come around this with that clown shit
So I gotta show'em with a little bit of melody, there will never ever be another Thug N Harmony
Everybody do it now and it dont really bother me, cus they already knowing im the leader of the artistry
Real in the streets, I keeps it real in the booth
Yeah and even that 9 millimetre I carry, it still spits the truth
Nigga dont test me, im not an experiment, you curiosity may be innocent
But before you niggas try to run up on me, im an incredible, hell of a lyricist
And it's impeccable, they can never deny the sound, it's so respectable
Have you heard this scary deadly flow? thats the reason all them other niggas want to catch the Boat (Float on)
I been save you rapper from sinking ever since I came in the game
And it ain't only rappers, it even some singers thats singing like us when they sang
Even producers producing the beat with the double time making that bang
So why in the fuck is they acting like we ain't the reason that everything changed?
Way back in the days when we came from East 99, the beats they deny me
And really I never had to be away, cus they fell asleep on a giant
So I came back and showed'em that I was the chosen one and they should never defy it
Imma rock til the beat stop, imma make'em feel it when the beat drop
You better bring a cold drink cus the heat hot, Nigga yall better think cus we not
But we retaliate and the shit was Kray cus it was really Kray, keep it real what the fuck im supposed to say?
I fucks with Kanye
I fucks with Jay
I fucks with Lil Wayne
I fucks with Drake
I wanna have a menage, I fucks with Nicki
I wanna rob a couple rappers, I fucks with 50
The flow was out of control, so I fucks with Kendrick
I fucks with Mos Def, he fucks with lyrics
I fucks with Eminem
I fucks with T.I
I fucks with 2 Chainz (Hey)
I fucks with Nipsey
I fucks with Jeezy, but not with you Mane
And im fuckin with A$AP
Remember the matter remains that, I tell em that Leathaface still in this bitch and I stay hitting hard as a train wreck
What a minute, you probably thought I was finished
With me it’s never an ending
The killer make sure you stay dead
This killer flow that be the gimmick
The illest of any minute
The realest, so many feel it
The lyrics really authentic
So potent that when you get it, you cough or choke when you hear it
Im knowing them niggas fearing, cus i got up in their spirit
I told them niggas in the beginning that Imma kill'em with 2000 words in 2 minutes (PIN IT)
Who that nigga running with the AK-47 packing pumps like it fit through us and 357
HEAT, so heated heavy that these competitors are never ready
Im like a disease, I keep spreading
I hittem like a headache or a migraine, watch a nigga die in the flames when I set it. (deadly)
Burn them to Hades, ain't non’ them met Krayzie, ain't never afraid (WHO SCARED?!)
Rocking like a real rapper, then I put a little Jodeci in it and say "Ooh Yeah!!“
I never wanna be a star, I rather kick it with the real niggas
Chillin with the field niggas
Get that dollar bill nigga
If I got to kill niggas, then you really finna meet this steel nigga
Coming ‘round the corner with the gun and you’re a goner
Cus im more than a performance, sending rappers to the coroner
So I give'em all a warning when you see a nigga stomping, coming at you with an attitude, all you gotta do is salute![Hook]

[Krayzie Bone]
Say nigga what's your problem?
Why do you let these niggas rob ya?
Why do you let them undermine ya, dupe ya and blind ya?
Why do you let them get up beside ya smile and connive ya!
Not trying to be funny my nigga
But I think your weakness is your kindness
Cause they don't respect ya man
They use ya then they neglect ya man
Look at ya, dog you're stressin'
You need to get up and check ya head
Saying that you'se a legend
Then why do they treat ya like a peasant?
Like you ain't relevant when your know your flow is prevalent?
WHY WHY WHY?!
All these other niggas getting paid from what you made
They elevate but you seem to stay underpaid
Stuck as a slave
Dont ya want to fly?
Dont ya wonder why they want a piece of your pie?
Always want to keep you high so they can bleed ya dry then leave ya to die!?
You need to get up in your business go handle it
You need to go in demanding it
Till they understand who the man in here!
Don't let em ram ya rear
Sip on a couple of cans of beer
Here whats a matter you scared? Man, nigga get outta my ear!!

Yeah.. yeah, uh-huh, uh uh, c'mon)

[Intro: Krayzie Bone]
Yeah check it out y'all, it's them Bone Thug niggas
In the house with that nigga Twista, DJ Khaled
Duece-double-oh-six, we 'bout to do it like this - yo

[Hook 2X: Krayzie Bone]
Just like that 9-millimeter comin to heat ya
Nigga we come straight for ya, out to destroy ya
They better believe as soon as they creep up
Niggas gon' see how my tongue kill just like my gun, gun

[Twista]
Twista spit it for hustlers, Twista spit it for hoes
But I'm 'bout servin these haters like I'm servin that 'dro
Spit for my gangstas and killers that'll put one in yo' dome
Spit it for my ballers and thugs that's addicted to chrome
Either rims or the thumper, now you ain't gotta wonder
What a Twista and here I go and never on drama
With purple 'bout a pound, and my truck I pound the sounds
And my 24's got blades on them that spin round and round
Back on the scene now, and I'm always seen high
Still flow motion overdosin, smokin on green now
When I'm on them Jordans, 20's look like 17's now
Sportin throwback Jordans from when I was 17 now
Still I'm steady +Po' Pimpin+, still spinnin and hustlin
Still +Adrenaline Rushin+ like when the pendulum's cuttin
Album comin out soon, but I already had props
Pullin Benz's up on the block before I met yo' pop

[Hook]

[Twista]
The Twista, playa balla, slash pimp MC
Straight from Chi-Tizzle my nizzle, never gon' get rid of me
On some (this is, this is) and they call us C.M.T
When they drop on how pop on about how it's so fly bein me
With a lethal chemistry, put them in your memory
When you want that original sound, it's either him or me
The most underrated artist in this whole industry
If rappin was the NBA I'd be Michael Finley
Still I'm bendin and grinnin, still I got pull in the club
Still I'm poppin my collar, grindin on girls in the club
Servin 50's, rims is bigger but I got love for the dub
They love the Twist' like love for the chief, and love for the thug
Cause I got that com' game, and I got that bomb flame
Let alarms ring when you hear the don's name
I copped the H-2-1's, some throwbacks like LeBron James
This time around I'mma let my nuts and my platinum charms hang

[Hook]

[Twista]
T be poppin them tags, T be coppin them Jags
And if the T do a stick-up you be droppin them bags
And I'm from where they cock hats instead of rockin them rags
And if they ain't cockin them hats they be cockin them mags
T be thuggin and clubbin, "Oh Twista that look tight"
Don't every time he step in the party he look so nice?
I'm officially fresh in my gear as I'm rockin mo' ice
And the Mitchell & Ness from the year when I used to flow like
Annilisms are my verbal metabolisms
Shatters prisms and my thug mannerism's of cataclysm manor
Causin some dis-establishment-arianism
I vary in wisdom, wins only cause I'm carryin ism and um
A street lyrical phantom, full of verses when I chant 'em
When this shit here hit the street it's gon' be the ghetto's anthem

[DJ Khaled]
Bone Thugs, Twista, DJ Khaled, LISTENNN!

[Hook]

[Outro: DJ Khaled]
Shouts out to Steve Lobel
Krayzie Bone, Bone Thugs, Swizz Beatz I see you
Twista, shit's crazy right here

It's DJ Khaled, historical, I'm a problem!

I'm talkin' 'bout dabs by the slab in the lab
You don't even know nothin' 'bout it
You tryna get this high? Little nigga I doubt it
Don't you ever forget

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Krayzie Bone]
I'm in my state of awareness, right now (right now, right now)
I can feel it so you know that clearly I'm high (I'm high, I'm high)
Split another swisher, keep it rollin'
Keep it rollin', keep it rollin'
Keep it rollin', keep it-
Split another swisher, keep it rollin'
Keep it rollin', keep it rollin'
Keep it rollin', keep it-
Mildly heat it, mildly heat it, mildly heat it
Hold it in until you get to chokin'
Blow it out and see how high you go (go, go, go, go)
When I be wingin', let us kill a bitch of hittin'
Cause we only twistin' sticky buddah
Potent dro (potent dro)
Out of my mind, that's how I like it
So like this, I'm (up, up)
But you need Bob Marley lungs
I hope you got some Bob Marley lungs (lungs, lungs)

[Hook]

(Smokin')
(Smokin')[Depswa] {Hook}
I wanna hurt you, I don't know why [4x]

[Krayzie Bone]
Woke up this morning in a cemetery, kinda weary
Looked over my shoulders and I seen somebody been just freshly buried
It's kinda scary cause my shirt was soaked in blood man
Shovel in my hand, so I had to be the one that dug that
But I had no knowledge, I don't even remember leaving the house man
Can't explain how I got here, its like I was walking while I was unconscious
But I had to be wildin', cause I seen a bloody machete, ah
Was it used on that victim to shred him up? Oh my God don't tell me I...oh shit
Something's going wrong, I don't know what's going on
All I know is I was home, and I woke up here alone
Wondering who was in that hole, but I ain't sticking around to know
My mind is blanking, I'm so gone, I don't know which way to go
Running in the rain, I'm barely breathing, more like wheezing
Running in the rain, how could this be, while I was sleeping?
I made it to my house, I closed the blinds, and bolt the door
Somebody please tell me what's going on cause I don't fucking know, fucking know

{Hook 4x}

[Krayzie Bone]
Jumped in the shower, washed the blood from off my body
Rolled up a blunt, I'm feeling psychotic, mixed me up some gin and tonic
But I'm nauseous, feeling woozy like I'm in the Twilight Zone the movie
How did I do it? How did I get through it?
And I wonder if anyone knew what I was doing
Sat down and clicked through the tube, flicked to the
News, I'm trying to get answers
Who's blood is this on my hands and how did this situation get so drastic?
Its madness, and I just can't take no more, I passed out
Couldn't help but crash out, from last night, I'm gassed out
Slept for a minute but I didn't sleep too long before
I was awakened by some heavy banging on my door
It was the po-po cause inside they shined they flashlights
Got a funny feeling that this got something to do with last night
They trying to tell me that I'm wanted for kidnap and murder
Telling me they got proof that I murdered my ex-employer
Don't think my lawyer can help me with this one, uh-uh
I grabbed my pistol, put the clip in and I'm out the back window, I'm gone

{Hook 4x}Chorus:

They call me the "Dummy Man" (man, man, man)
And I'm up early tryina slang my dope
(I'm the nigga with the biggest rocks)
The fiends...they get awfully mad....(mad, mad, mad)
When they go broke on dope and it's really soap
(My nigga you ain't never lied)

Verse 1:

Up in the morning....and I feel like I don't wanna be livin'
Better off dead without no bread....have you ever felt that feeling?
Unsatisfied, feelin' like you wanna die
When you reach into your pocket and can't even find
Not even enough to go purchase a dime (sack of weed)
But FUCK THAT! I got "come up" in my blood
Cause it's the "1st of the Month" (nigga what!)
The perfect time to come up
The only problem is: I'm broke and ain't got no dope
But as I was standin' in my bathroom mirror....I looked at the soap
Shit...soap look a little like dope (you scandalous nigga!)
Then, I chopped-chopped up me some counterfeit amphetamines
But wait a minute.....
Wait a minute now...what if they want to taste it?
Think quickly for cash: nigga dash to the kitchen, get the bread bag
Wrap that bread around some soap
Now I got the breadcrumb-dum-dum dope
It might sound funny, but it ain't no joke...
Cause doin this shit could get a nigga smoked, mayn
But FUCK IT! Young nigga gotta get them duckets
Hit the medicine cabinet for the final touches...
Orajel for the numbness
Then I hit the corner with a handful of breadcrumbs...
Nigga got the dum-dum for ya
And the pump on approach if you say it ain't dope
Only dealin cause I hate to be sober
Peep, "creep on ah come up", I wait for a fiend to roll up
And walk to the car with my hand on my pistol
He showed me the green, said
"Hold up...gotta get my stash"
Nigga need a 20...but I got that faded
Lovin these yum-yums, glad I made it;
I just hope this nigga don't try to taste it!
I dropped him the dummy, he said it was lovely
But as he pulled off, I pinned that he put the rock up in his mouth
(So he gon' come back for his money!)
I pinned that he braked...he skid...
Put it in reverse and he came back quick...
Fiend jumped out and he talkin' all big...
This is what happened to this bit....
We beat him and finished him off, and he never came 'round here no more
Cause a nigga ran into yours truly: poor, and a nigga scored
Lord forgive me but I can't remember (the last time I ate)
Now I gots to go get me a plate, or a bit, now I'm proper
Only spent three dollars and forty-four cents
Nigga full, now I gotta get bent
Nigga still got sixteen dollars and fifty-six cents...HELL YEAH!
These dum-dums got a nigga off the hook..they got booked, took, shook
Look: got dope but it ain't dope, so I guess you can call me a "crooked crook"
Hey...do you know somebody like me?
I don't think so, cause ain't nobody I see
Down for the crime like I'm down for mine
And if I gotta, nigga I cheat
(cheat)

Chorus (x2)

So fuck with me, I got the chops mayn (chops mayn)
The biggest rocks up on the block mayn (block mayn)
Say fuck with me, I got tha chops mayn (the chopper, choppers)
The biggest rocks up on the block mayn (block mayn {echo})Hey...Who can take some bread crumbs (who can take some bread crumbs)
Mix it up with soap (mix it up with soap)
Create a 20 rock to make the fiends think it's dope?
The Dummy Man, The Dummy Man
Ohhh...the Dummy Man can, the Dummy Man can, the Dummy Man can
Cuz he gives 'em extra love to make 'em think it's all good
And they think it's all good...[Krayzie Bone]
Is anybody here?
Can anybody hear?

I hear echoes in my head
I hear echoes in my head
I hear echoes in my head
I hear echoes in my head

[Eko Fresh]
Sie verfolgen mich, habe meinen Scheiß-Kopf voll damit
Aber nein, ich wollt es nicht

[Krayzie Bone]
Echoes in my head

[Serc]
Sie verfluchen mich

[Summer Cem]
Ich halt es nicht aus, sie halten mich auf
Ich bete zu Gott und hoff, bald sind sie raus

[Krayzie Bone]
Echoes in my head

[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
Take an everyday walk in the rain
Its time for me to have another talk in my brain
Lost in my ways and im always driftin'
Don't nobody hear me but they always listenin', sheisty shiftin'
Who can I call when I need to hold someone when times get hard
Better not these frauds find out who really your friends
When you losin my love with your ends and they all gone
I remember when you told me that you love me
You had me convinced you really loved me
But when the road got a little bit bumpy, mayne
Our beautiful thang became ugly (DAMN)
So I talk to myself to deny just to get through the night
While I tried to forget you tonight
See no speak of evil but my ego hearin echo

[Verse 2: Eko Fresh]
Höre diese Stimmen und sie ficken meinen Kopf
Der Kack hier gehört leider mit zu meinem Job
Die Stimmen in my brain bringen immer Trän'
Klingen wieder, klingen nach dem innerlichen pain
Ich fing an zu versteh'n, das sind Echos in my head
Ihr geht alle feiern, während Eko immer rappt
Droppe meinen Vers und ich rette jeden Track
Sorry, ihr seid nicht auf meinem Level mit dem Dreck
Viele der Lappen, sie wollen, doch können nicht flow'n, homes, no
Aber wir rollen on chrome, komme mit Bone Bone Bone
Und ich hör keinen anderen Ton als hätt ich meine Beats auf, peace out
Lebe in 'nem Mietshaus
Aber nach diesem Album, da kannst du erkennen, yo, wie ich eins kauf
Wie ich eins kauf, wie ich eins kauf

[Krayzie Bone]
Echoes in my head

[Verse 3: Summer Cem]
Abstand, Rheydt-West, wo du wachsam wirst, meine Brüder sind am Abkassier'n
Deine Brüder sind nachts am Frier'n, gib mir den Stift und ein Blatt Papier
Die Stimmen in meinem Kopf spielen immer Ping Pong
Cem ist ein Freak und wenn du's nicht siehst, dann hörst du es in den Songs
Glaub mir doch, Pisser, wenn ich es dir sage, dann nimm es doch einfach so hin
Bone Thugs und Summer Cem, das Eksodus-Album ist King
Ich gucke herab auf das deutsche Gen, diese Kanacken ham' euch geprägt
Ihr meint, ihr wärt grade die Eu's am Zähl'n, doch ich bin bei der Bank und kann euch nicht seh'n
Ich kann euch nicht seh'n, ich kann euch nicht seh'n

[Verse 4: Serc]
An manchen Tagen denk ich nach: Wann war mein Kopf leer?
Scheiß mal auf Rap, denn ich habe kein Bock mehr
Es geht nicht um Geld oder Fame oder so
Ich bin übertalentiert, aber leider nicht froh
Jeder redet über Drogen, was wollen sie mitteil'n
Ich überlege, überlebe, denn ich muss ein' Hit schreib'n
Manchmal hab ich keine Power, manchmal will ich aufhör'n
Die Stimmen bestimmen mein Leben und ich muss darauf hör'n
Alle diese Hänger wollen alle mit mir ficken, doch ich geh mein Weg
Ich bleib im Regen steh'n und werd nie untergeh'n
Ey yo, mein Kopf ist so voll, voller Wut, voller Hass
Sag, wen int'ressiert's, ob du weinst oder lachst
Ich bin desorientiert und habe alles vermasselt
Doch ich werde weiter rappen, bis sie mich endlich verlassen

[Hook: Krayzie Bone]
I hear echoes in my head
I hear echoes in my head
I hear echoes in my head
I hear echoes in my head

[Ado Kojo]
Es sind die Stimmen in mei'm Kopf
Ich will nur, dass es stoppt
Ich halt's nicht aus, bitte lieber Gott

Echoes in my head

Es sind die Stimmen im mei'm Kopf
Befinde mich im Block
Hier lebend rauszukommen, hab ich innerlich gehofft

Echoes in my head[Intro: Krayzie Bone]

Hit em with a sound so explosive (explosive)
I take em under as if I was hypnosis (hypnosis)
The flow picks you up and won’t let ya down
It keeps you up, it won’t let ya down
Explosive, explosive, explosive, explosive
Explosive, explosive, explosive, explosive

[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]

With a mystic mind, I come with the wicked and rip the rhyme
The rhythm is leavin em hypnotised
They really been missin the Gemini, feel the vibe, real am I
Unstoppable, takin a loss ain’t optional
Breakin me off ain’t possible, Dominoes!
Reaction, attack em, collapse em, combat em and smash em
Get at em, remind em that its that Thuggish Ruggish madness (madness)
We keepin it real, no matter how they think we soft, we let em know
You bustas tryna really get with Bone, LETS GO

[Hook: Krayzie Bone]

Try to play me like I’m weak
But can’t none of em compete
So get out of my mind (my mind) [MY MIIIND]
They wishin they can catch me sleep
But I stop em and they creep
Back em up with my nine (my nine) [MY NIIINE]
I keep em up off of my feet
Let em prey from underneath
Don’t be wastin my time (my time) [MY TIIIME]
The hustle in me runs deep
Cause you know I’m from the streets
So I stay on my grind

Cause I’m gonna be somebody (hey), I’m somebody (hey), we somebody (hey)
Come on, I’m gonna be somebody (hey), I’m somebody (hey), we somebody (hey)
I’m finna get ready to ride

[Verse 2: Krayzie Bone]

Look at me grind, I’m still contendin
I’m the attacker while you’re the defendant
You be the victim and I’ll be inflictin ya lyrical PAIN
This bullet’s addictin, give em the fixin
Under The Influence of my invention, injection my intention
P.O.D. is the condition
Reaction, attack em, collapse em, combat em and smash em
Get at em, remind em that its that Thuggish Ruggish madness (madness)
We keepin it real, no matter how they think we soft, we let em know
You bustas tryna really get with Bone, LETS GO

[Hook: Krayzie Bone]

[Bridge: Krayzie Bone]

Hit em with a sound so explosive (explosive)
I take em under as if I was hypnosis (hypnosis)
The flow picks you up and won’t let ya down
It keeps you up, it won’t let ya down
Explosive, explosive, explosive, explosive
Explosive, explosive, explosive, explosive
LETS GO

[Hook: Krayzie Bone]

[Outro: Krayzie Bone]

Yeah, I don’t know what these niggas thought mayne
But this is classic swag
Y’all niggas better recognize, Kray Jack is legendary money

You can’t hold me down, I’m blowin up (blowin up)
You can’t hold me down, I’m blowin up Explosive (2x)
You can’t hold me down, I’m blowin up...Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!
(surprise)
Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!
(surprise)
Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!
(surprise)
Fuck the police!!!
(You muthafuckin' right)

[Krayzie Bone]
Fuck the police comin' straight from the underground
A young nigga got it bad cause I'm brown
And not the other color so police think
They have the authority to kill a minority
But muthafucka makin' as I ain't the one
For a punk muthafucka with a badge and a gun
To be beaten on, and thrown in jail
But we can go toe to toe in the middle of a cell
Fuckin' with a nigga cause a nigga turned major
And got a little bit of money and a pager
Searchin my car, lookin' for the product
Thinkin' every thug nigga is sellin' narcotics
You'd rather see, me in the pen
Than me blowin' endo, rollin' in my Benz-o
I send the police to the grave
And when I'm finished
They will bring the yellow tape
To tape off the scene of the slaughter
Still gettin' swoll off bread and water
I don't know if their're fags or what
Search a nigga down, and grabbin' his nuts
And on the other hand, without a gun they can't get none
But don't let it be a black and a white one
Cause they'll slam you down to the street top
Black police showin' out for the white cop
But Krayzie Bone will swarm
On any muthafucka in a blue uniform
Just cause I'm from, the C-L-E
Them punk muthafuckas be afraid of me
Uh, a young nigga on the warpath
And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath
Of cops, dyin' around my way
Yo bitch I got somethin to say

Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!
(surprise)
Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!
(surprise)
Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!
(surprise)
Fuck the police!!!
(You muthafuckin' right)...

[Bizzy Bone]
Fuck the police and Bone said it with authority
Because the niggas on the street is a majority
A gang, and is with whenever I'm steppin'
Then the muthafuckin' weapon is kept in
A stash spot, for the so-called law
Wishin' Bone was a nigga that they never saw
Lights start flashin' behind me
But they're scared of a nigga so they mace me to blind me
But that shit don't work, I just laugh
And plus it gives 'em a hint, not to step in my path
The police, I'm sayin': "Fuck you punk!"
Readin' my rights and shit - it's all junk
Pullin' out a silly club, so you stand
With a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand
But take off the gun so we can see what's up
And we'll go at it punk and I'mma fuck you up
Make you think I'mma kick your ass
But drop your gat, and Bone's gon' blast
I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime
And I'mma smoke 'em now and not next time
Smoke any muthafucka that sweats me
And any asshole, that threatens me
I'm a sniper with a helluva scope
Takin' out a cop or two, they can't cope with me
The muthafuckin' killer that's mad
With potential, to get bad as fuck
So I'mma turn it around
Dig in the clip, yo, and this is the sound
BOOM BOOM - yeah, somethin like that
But it all depends on the size of the strap
Takin' out a police, will make my day
And a nigga like Bone don't give a fuck to say

Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!
(surprise)
Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!
(surprise)
Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!
(surprise)
Fuck the police!!!
(You muthafuckin' right)...

[Layzie Bone]
I'm tired of this muthafuckin' jackin'
Sweatin' my thug while I be thuggin' in the shack and
Shinin' them lights in my face and for what?
Maybe it's because I kick so much, but
I kick ass nigga or maybe cause I blast
On a stupid-ass nigga when I'm playin' with the trigger
Of any Uzi or an A.K
Cause the police always got somethin' stupid to say
They put out my picture with silence
Cause my identity along with my group cause it's violence
It's the Bone with the criminal behavior
Yeah, I'm a thugster nigga
But still I got flavor
Without a gun and a badge, what do you got?
A nigga in a uniform waitin' to get shot by me
Or one of my niggas
And with a gat it don't matter if you're smaller or bigger
(Size don't mean shit, I'm from the old school fool)
And as you all know Layzie Bone came to rule
Whenever I'm rollin' keep 'em lookin' in your mirror
And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a
Dumb muthafucka with a gun
And when I'm rollin' off the 8, you'll be the one
That I take out, and then I get away
And while I'm drivin' off laughin' this is what I'll say
Believe that

Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!
(surprise)
Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!
(surprise)
Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!
(surprise)
Fuck the police!!!
(You muthafuckin' right)...
