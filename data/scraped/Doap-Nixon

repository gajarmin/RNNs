[Verse 1: Planetary]
Yeah! Yo, uh
A lot of rappers try approaching the omen
My poems will punish your people while I’m up at the podium
Pharaohs folding 'em, like washed clothes again
I'm a vulture when the flow go choke your kin
Broke, I leave most of them, slow, I keep my motionin'
Eye on the prize
I silence the wise, my lyrics make a scientist cry
Making a secret society expose their purpose
Making 'em unleash info and explode in my surface
I'm taking my time to birth this, rap entity earthless
It's show time, there's no time, be ready when the curtain split
I'm hurtin' shit, too powerful for painkillers
On the concrete jungle we walk like trained guerillas
Untamed, and my niggas is Kane, Kool G, Rakim, combined into one frame
We like the new mecca of immaculate rappers
Vinnie Paz, call the goons, now we back with the clappers

[Verse 2: Chief Kamachi]
Yo, remain silent, kill him with what I mentally says
Bloody Fez, choke you like an Indian rez
Kamach, animal Turk, sick with a cannibal smirk
Welcome, this where the murderers lurk
It's my mind, that make sure that the Sun can work
Scorch bodies, leave all of your gunmen hurt
Pharaoh sultans, create a serious cult jam
And my hand is where the tears of the pope ran
They stay watching like they keep me on a scope cam
I'm in Heaven with the angels that smoke grams
You need God, that's why the earth so damned
International, trying to get my flow banned
That's cool, if I don't kick these prayers
A lot of floods and fam' is gonna hit these years
Kamachi back on the chapel stairs
Open the clouds, let the thunder clap your ears

[Verse 3: King Syze]
You wanna put your money up? Then muthafucker then put it
For your family's sanity man, I wish that you wouldn't
Niggas got nice flows, just dont know where to put it
And I know your whole life your raps are edited footage
And y'all mixtape niggas couldn't see my plateaus
All up in my presence, while y'all actin' bashful
King Syze casting an ecliptic rap flow
Y'all little light niggas couldn't feed my shadows
From, city to city, intersection to section
But you reflexin', with or without a weapon
I'm always steppin', never scared
But always and forever prepared
Yeah the ones who drink gas man is revvin' their gears

[Verse 4: Reef the Lost Cauze]
You now rocking' with the foulest clique in the continent
Total dominance, rise to prominence
In my prime like Optimus, stand in astonishment
At this conglomerate, an axis of evil
I know where Osama is, he down in Camp David
Down and dirty like a damp basement
The champ must demand greatness
From himself, or be another contender
There's hundreds of niggas
Dead left under the river
From the days of slaves
To hurricanes in Orleans
See my people's graves floatin' amongst the waves
There's hell to pay, but
The devil don't take checks
I tried to send a message to God
His phone don't take texts
I need a new plan, a crook with knowledge
Times is hard homie, why I took them dollars
Man, my momma got a mortgage
And my little baby sister need books for college
I rob all of y'all

[Verse 5: Doap Nixon]
Hey, yo, they want the hood in here so they called me first
I give 'em rappers gatorade cause they ball with thirst, UH!
This is more than music
But these niggas is mad trash
That's why the stores refuse 'em
Yo, I'm out in Georgia, went straight to the block
I'm seein' cats motorcyclin' dawg, I'm doin the walk
I'm an O.G., call my Italian niggas a wop
Though their papers ain't right, but they got weight on the block
I love 'em uh
Hand to hand, see your hands ache
I drunk so much syrup dawg I stopped eatin' pancakes
Ya niggas cool dawg mine's absurd hot
Stop frontin' like you's a killer money, your nerves shot
Yo you's a Paxil nigga, dumpin' Zoloft in coffee
AOTP what exhaust be
Can't keep it gear, cause I'm blinging with F's
But I got my mind right so swing your shit to the left

[Verse 6: Demoz]
Nigga if I had 24 hours to live
Fuck 24 hours, gimme 24 seconds
Vin I'm drivin' off a bridge
Broken rib, no windshield, covered in kerosene
Gasoline tank filled to the top
Magazines of these phony rappers ripped in pieces
No priest is, strong enough to take me out of my zone
I broke Jesus, choke niggas who squeal
Rob niggas who steal, kill niggas who kill
I'm too sick for a pill
Man these niggas ain't real, they real fake
They say they a man but they fuckin' reveal snakes
That's when you put 'em in a truck with their grill taped
Rip in reverse then run into a steel gate
I'm a suicide driver, never been a liar
If I don't kill you later, I'mma kill you Mañana
You don't want no problems
You don't want no drama
Nigga I'mma take a trip with your baby momma, suicide driver

[Verse 7: Celph Titled]
Ya better cross your T's
Cause we'll dot your eyes
You can say that you specialize but pharaohs will optimize
Backstage will get a bitch back smacked there
The mac glare like dirty south pimp slap clap snares, YEAH!
Holy paragraphs, what kind of shit is that?
I'm Jesus in the flesh so this is motherfuckin' Christian rap
Y'all just Christmas wrap, must be the secret Santa
My reindeer aim near, pierce you with the antlers
I made 'em go easy, and called off the wolves on my AOTP radio CB
Cause y'all ain't worthy of grenades and RPGs
Slit throat, hope you float with sardines and seaweed
Cause this is C-E-L-P-H demonic symphony
Listen to the hell we make
And a year before your kids tenth birthday came
You didn't have to wait for candles on the cake to see the nine flame

[Verse 8: Vinnie Paz]
Respect a G, my clique clap at you incessantly
I lay back and drink alcohol excessively
It ain't a rapper that's alive today that's testing me
I got degrees in being ignorant and weaponry
A 40 oz and Dutch Master is the recipe
That's my shit there, that'll be the death of me
Give me a death mask, better yet an effigy
I understand the math of death and it's complexity
I understand how you was violently murked
I understand how you was raised under the lies of the church
But understand and recognize that I'm cursed
With the ability to end your fucking lives with a verse[INTRO:  SAMPLES]
I would move Heaven and Hell and anything in between to get to you. You wouldn’t be safe anywhere if I was mad at you. And that’s not bull; that’s truth. I’ve went up against people. You could pull a gun on me and if I’m mad at you I’m coming forward. You’d have to shoot me to stop me and if you don’t kill me… you’re stupid cause the next time you see me I will kill you

[VERSE 1:  PLANETARY]
They call us gorillas, we brawling, you in coffins with killers
You at the auction, I’m boss and smoking cigars at the dealer
Nigga I’m iller, count scrilla like casinos, only c-notes and over
I’m a cancer nigga no chemo
I’m dancing with satanic people, life is illegal
I’m heroin in the needle, my emotions are see-through
I’m evil, read your palm before dawn and spawn
Calm before the storm’s Katrina nigga, I’m drawn
Too much to handle in seconds I manhandle the peasants
Dismantle is pleasant, turn their Hell to my Heaven
I excel with my brethren, giving birth to nuclear weapons
I’m shooting your henchmen, every written verse is a lesson
I’m close to perfection with rap nigga I’m flawless
I’m God’s light, the type to illuminate in the darkness
Hand me the trophy, the gold medals and plaques
The torch is lit, I scorch your clique, nigga I’m back

[VERSE 2:  DEMOZ]
If I ain’t on my grind then I’m high trying to take your cheque
I done hustled on the hottest block and I ain’t break a sweat
AKs and TECs make them vacate a set
If he ain’t trying to pay his debt then we gotta spray his neck
You get laid to rest, nigga this is Murderville
Now smell the essence of the L, nigga this is Earth for real
Fuck a bitch, I’ll leave a nigga burnt for real
Signed to the streets but the judge ain’t served the deal
I just turn the wheel, hit em in the back pocket
Waiting for a pussy to creep, give him my best shot
Now sing a lullaby, sorry mama I’m mangled
And I’m about to catch a motherfucking homicide
This bitch named Karma got me going crazy and it’s fucking hot
I don’t wanna go away I’m like an addict in his fucking prime
Lit trying to get a hit, hungry for this money
If there’s tension in the room then you know it’s coming from me

[HOOK]

We pull them Glocks out, we about to make a change
One to wipe your block out, guaranteed to hit your frame
This’ll hit the vein, the official Pistol Gang
Pharaoh clique, a nigga sick, I’m quick enough to split your brain

We pull them Glocks out, we about to make a change
One to wipe your block out, guaranteed to hit your frame
This’ll hit the vein, the official Pistol Gang
Pharaoh clique, a nigga sick, I’m quick enough to split your brain

[VERSE 3:  VINNIE PAZ]
My rap will give you fucking brain cancer
Different question cousin same answer
Y’all motherfuckers made me scrap like I was Kane’s dancer
But there’s a method to my madness unusual still
They call me Pistol Pete Maravich moving the pill
We push a lot of everything but it’s usually krill
We use a lot of weaponry when you gruesomely killed
I thought a lot of destiny but it’s truthfully real
That could make a warrior like Zeus if he’s truthfully ill
I went to Hell and then I saw the abyss
Where dirtbag drink from the same water he piss
It’s Armageddon when I ball up the fist
It’s God Consciousness that started this remarkable gift
I was a martyr, it was horror when my father was sick
I was a monster, I would stomp you in the yard with a brick
I’m a survivor but I got the fucking charm of a pit
That just attacked you, now you got your fucking arm in his grip

[VERSE 4:  DOAP NIXON]
Niggas try to hate, we don’t hear the side talk
Them loud mouths, gotta hit em with the wide hook
Barack wants help, all my bodies buy em chalk
My niggas upstate squared with the fried shock
This for y’all wild out when your cell’s cracked
You know your time’s short when they trying to send your mail back
We catch bodies for the love of the block
I collect shit, I got a hammer and the glove of a cop
So while you hugging model jawns I was hugging the block
One for the money, two for the pop, three for a rock
Yeah say I’m steamed when I’m pulling a scam quick
Old Reservoir Dogs, lay your blood on the canvas
Quick to blow diesel but the game is sour
And you’s a pussy, where I’m from that’s the name of a coward
So when you get your weight up I’m already in power
Who wants war? My niggas fly planes into towers, Pharaohs

[HOOK][Intro]

Die motherfuckers die - Scarface
AOTP shit nigga
Die, die, die
Die motherfuckers die - Scarface

[Verse 1: Planetary]

Top Gun of this rap shit
Cock guns to blast shit, nigga what's the meaning of that
Shit, scheming, a black Smith & Wesson, what's hood
I'm grown, now I gotta start protecting my goods
I gotta start protecting every one of my kids
I gotta start protecting everything I got in the crib (That's my shit)
I gotta have a fresh pair J's for the whizz
If not trees, if not that I ain't handle my bizz
A screwed up way to live
But that's me, follow my lead it is what it is (my niggas)
I hold steel in the hour of chaos
And hurdle through the base heads tryin' to just play with the odds
I'm not the type of nigga to claim god
But dog I heard you spit
Do't quit your day job
I've always been the cat to slave hard
Hoping that the dealer don't turn over the face card

[Verse 2: Doap Nixon]

Fuck the claps and cheers, all we want is respect
And ya'll fuckers are wild lame, yall ain't nothing to sweat, UH
Still certified greens and tan trees
Still in the hood like damp leaves and banshees
The last time they seen Vinnie Paz and kenny spaz
We was blazed up in a cab, waving a semi- mag
That was the time I dropped out of college
The god of law thought he would go on his own
Is still knowledge, knowledge
Kinda ridiculous the way I get in this shit
Some felt ignorant, me felt innocent
So for now on my gods you now strong
Niggas want war I get you murked by a wild jawn
The only reason I ain't on and my niggas is on
Is cuz I got stuck on the gold pot that I'm sitting on
Till I seen there wasn't nothing there
From my eyes to my ears I got stains of bloody tears

[Hook: Demoz]

AOTP, they know we be, O-N T-O-P
(Die mother fucker, die)
Fucking with these gentlemen, we run up in your residence, get you for your presidents
(Die mother fucker, die)
Make up the break up, I don't wanna wake up, If I don't got my cake up
(Die mother fucker, die)
AOTP, on top we be he he he he
(Die mother fucker, die)

[Verse 3: Demoz]

The psycho's back strong enough to push the Eifel back
Halloween mask, Michael's back
Stay in your lane, you no named niggas get lipo'd up
Lose weight when the rifle bust, I don't like you fucks
They want my life I want 5 mics, problem is I'm unsigned hyped
Fuck is the deal, give me life in the booth with no fucking appeal
I bet you my left lung they can't fuck with the skill
Bet you my right hand they gon' die in the trauma
It's the front street terrorist I ride like Osama
It's a thin line between a prick and a fool
But these faggots they keep acting like snitching is cool
Man these faggots they keep acting like I ain't a beast
Till their face is next to their sons under the beach
Food for the crabs mission accomplished nigga take it in blood
It's a wrap, my crew acting like Satan is loved

[Verse 4: Vinnie Paz]

I'm Jesus in reverse, the son of Satan with a fire arm
Water to blood, apocalyptic fire storm
You a sucka rapper, never know what side you on
I shoot my biscuit in the air until the sky is gone
A 16 of mine murder your entire song
9M submachine is long like your entire arm
I'm a loud mouth fucka not a quiet storm
I don't believe in an afterlife so once you die you gone
Never nothin soft, everythin' a violent song
Kanye West, gay rapper, thats when lines are drawn
Qwest hit me with a beat like he Italian mob
It ain't even beef no more, its Hillshire Farm
I ain't gonna leave your family any time to mourn
My clenched fist shows the power that's inside the palm
The same 'palm that was taking human lives in 'Nam
And I ain't stoppin it till' all these human lives are gone

[Hook]

[Outro: Vinnie Paz]

Cocksucker (hahaha)
Brat brat, yeah
Big Louis Doggs (yeah)
The genocide general (motherfucker)
Doap Nix (AOTP)
Demoz
Planetary
AOTP
Kwest on the beat
It ain't a game baby
Brap brap, hahaha
Cocksucker!

(Die, motherfucker die, die, die motherfucker die)[Intro] x2

I don’t know what she’s doing now
Last I heard from her she said
She felt as if she should be dead
I guess in fact she usually does


[Verse 1: Planetary]

I never could understand the fact she ain’t returned my calls
I was the only one that I told her I loved her through all the flaws
I would always be the one to show her light in the tunnel
I swear to God I need her back, I know she’s lost in the jungle
I know she need me, can’t believe we grew apart so quick
She loved trees like me, the way the New Eras fit
She loved Tommy Hilfiger, Rugbys, and Adidas
A match made before Heaven, why the feelings have to leave us?
But they didn’t leave my heart so fast
I still wish I had her near and had a beer for her glass
Even though I know that’s her downfall from the past
Still wanna shop for old time sake if she asks
Little shot of Crown Royale, maybe 151
So if you see her let her know the plan to have us some fun
Well guess what? Today front page of the daily news
My queen betting the beam dead right ? what the fuck?

[Hook]

I don’t know what she’s doing now
Last I heard from her she said
She felt as if she should be dead
I guess in fact she usually does

[Verse 2: Doap Nixon]

Ever see a jawn so confused and assed out?
She’ll suck any dude off chasing the cash route
She went from pompoms to kine bud
I watched the innocence transform, obsession to buying drugs
Little Tooty was a cutie, I swear God
Carmel complexion, good grade with a hair bob
Ten years later now she’s bobbing to head jobs
In and out of strip clubs like a career job
And she can’t see that she’s killing herself
Cause a couple dollars got this drunk feeling herself
It’s ill how this little girl could be ruthless
She can make a nigga with three degrees look stupid
She even tried to trick a couple dollars from Cupid
Emotionally it'll drain your ass out till you’re useless
The price is high when you wanna ride
With a jawn that’s suicide, she’s a suicide, c’mon

[Hook]

I don’t know what she’s doing now
Last I heard from her she said
She felt as if she should be dead
I guess in fact she usually does

[Verse 3: Apathy]

She said I must confess it turns me on when I cut my flesh
There’s nothing left, I’m hollow, I’ll follow death
If it’s a change from the mundane Mondays
You know my pain, I’m empty inside, my veins pump Novocaine
Sometimes I feel like life isn’t real
And my brain is too busy and my mind don’t ever heal
I could never shut it off so I’d rather shut it down
Do it right the first time, I ain’t trying to fuck around
And she smiles for her friends but the smile is a mask
Any memories of happiness are filed in the past
I can sit in my garage foot revving on the gas
A slash and a gasp or a violent blast
I don’t believe in Hell unless it’s what I’m in
I wanna free my soul, straight jump out of my skin
She exhaled and sighed, eyes opened wide
Suicide, it’s a suicide BUH DAH BUH BUH

[Outro]

I don’t know what she’s doing now
Last I heard from her she said
She felt as if she should be dead
I guess in fact she usually does

It’s so hard for me to explain
I guess she has a strange approach
It makes her seem beyond reproach
Until you find out what she is[Verse 1: Doap Nixon]
I’m in the kitchen cooking up bananas
Cameras on the roofs with the police scanners
By any means I’ma get these papers
Ride with a nigga or catch these vapors
Smooth melodic, cool water with butters on
Got beef with a nigga, save that for another song
Paz on point so he putting his brothers on
Steeze still the same, get you murked by a gutter jawn
Head in the streets cause the whip is spacious
Benz stretched out legs feel like a spaceship
Checks ain’t clear, I’m hitting y’all with the facts
If the check never came I’d hit your mom in the cap
Got the streets on smash, kilos on wax
Hundred pack on iTunes trying to make cream back
Yeah, the key’s cooked and the bricks is stove-top
It’s Chef Boyardee flipping nicks on your whole block

[Verse 2: Des Devious]
Yeah, born in the coldest winter, live and I die a sinner
And while I’m here I’m hustling, get paper with my niggas
Last of a dying breed, Pharaoh clique in your section
Before I leave my rest, kiss my Wess, load my weapon
Yeah that’s my right hand man, that fifty cal chrome
Off-safety when I roam, I ain’t never alone
Won’t catch a nigga slipping, won’t catch a nigga dipping
Cause I done mastered my high, you out your mind tripping
Yeah you can come and try, won’t be the smartest move
My bitch’ll pull the hammer and make it do what it do
Hustler, a son of one, bitch I’m a son of one
My money done got right, copped me another gun

[Verse 3: Crypt The Warchild]
These punk bitches get the bozak, the gas face
I feel like Earnhardt in his last race
This last lap in this game, I’ma hit the throttle
Syze, we celebrate new life, hit this bottle
Plan, I think the situation’s getting hairy
We make them say the Our Father and the Hail Mary
Scary how niggas turn Judas, no trust
I take it back to 5-6 when it was only us
Snakes slither in the grass in the killing field
So I maneuver through them by sitting in a bigger wheel
You’s a small time hustler, I’m a bigger deal
And that shit you spill gon’ be the shit that get you killed
Ready for war and I’m in it for the long haul
Throwing a molotov sidearm
Yeah, holding my fort with my pipes drawn
I kill everything when this mic’s on, believe it

[Hook: Demoz]
Ayo, f-u-c-k F-B-I cops and niggas who don’t like my shit
I tell them niggas suck a dirty dick with gonorrhea on the tip
I’m getting money courtesy of your bitch
Nigga it’s the Army of the Pharaohs, we hood American Idols
You don’t like us? You can suck my dick
I got a long rope and an oxy if you feeling suicidal
See that window? Hop out that bitch

[Verse 4: Demoz]
Now if you think you can easily be it then be it but see me not
I’m too heated and weeded to lose it so please be hot
They just fiending to be the most conceited team on the top
I’m leaning to be the most meanest as Biggie and Pac
Man these demons is dreaming like I just grieve for their spot
It’s easy to see they just want to be me cause I’m hot
So fuck my theme and my plot, smoking weed in your rock
And fall dummy to that casket cause they eat at you pop
You can believe it or not, I done sold weed to a cop
Caught a case, banged it and ran back to the fiends on my block
Fiends on my block? That’s logical, my flow is phenomenal
I put a couple dots on your block like dominoes
Red beaming them, I stay with my team and them
I keep four nines in the tuck like Steve and them
Diss my track, I'll diss like that
Cause when you shoot like a free-throw you miss like Shaq

[Verse 5: Planetary]
I’m from Killadelph county, the killers they all surround me
I’m losing my nigga slowly, Poppa Large, I make him proud of me
If you see Nemi then tell your people to see me
I’m here for the take and holding these streets down, believe me
My nigga Balo, I know your halo is platinum
I’ma see you at the gates, I’ll be rocking something ravishing
The Seven Sacraments made for the sacrificial
The baptismal of rap bristle to sacramental
My rap essentials is murder tracks and pencils
Gat utensils is only used for niggas acting simple
My syllable slice niggas like a cesarean
You killable right? I spit bars like a barbarian

[Verse 6: Reef The Lost Cauze]
I never thought I’d see the day hip hop would give birth to faggots
Mr. T mohawks and Urkel glasses, I’m from a hood where they rob cool kids
And I can’t wear skinny jeans cause my Glock’s too big
Yeah, I got the wildest style, death bears a childish smile
Beat you with soap in a sock, you a Private Pyle
I fear order, from green onions I peel quarters
What’s rap? I bump Foghat and Creedence Clearwater
Bad moon rising, I’m howling at the bitch
Haters baffled how he spent a thousand on the kicks
I get thousands just to spit, fuck all the drama shit
I don’t make statements, get bank statements and deposit slips
And it’s always gonna be this way
C-notes like study hall in tenth grade
To this day I fuck bitches and get paid
What’s piff? I got the green monster like Fenway
Mmmkay?

[Hook][Jus Allah]
You might be the proud new father
I am their future martyr
Who slaughters like blood is the new water
Who's darker, who owns a tooth sharpener
Who's partner is a fool for his tool carver
No disputing, refutings, no eludings
Just shootings, feudings, no undoings
No diffusing, abusings, unexcusing
Shoestring removings becoming behooving
They don't pay me to kill but to stop killing
I don't hold my end of the deal, I should stop billing
Any lesser of an evil is not fulfilling
Don't text your house cleaner for a mop spilling
You're the trailer, teaser, I'm the feature
You ail, you're weaker, I am neither
I'm a leader, you're a cheater, deceiver
Easier, a receiver, breeder!

[Chief Kamachi]
Musical martyr who do it harder
Fresh to death, like a French funeral parlor
Church and Kamala hurts for the scholars
France holla, anywhere between the Earth and Shambhala
A black and white collar, grimy like crack pipes schwala
Trying to get a rap life dollar
Still spit it for shelltoes lottos with the velcros
It's killa code I dun did it till hell froze
Old school Guc jacket dirty elbows
My boombox blast the heavens
I talk shit, stuck bibles in the ass of reverends
They wonder what faith he is
Is he Muslim, Christian, or Atheist?
It don't matter, brain splatter just take a clip
Only present, ain't no way to escape the clique

[Vinnie Paz]
This a drama theme, you a faggot rapper drama queen
My body work is vicious quick enough to rock your spleen
Ain't nothin' funny sonny, even Vinnie's Glock is mean
Steady with a machete ready for me to chop your team
How is Bush still here, we shoulda been shot him
Hologram, Taliban, call me Vin Laden
You a new jack hustla, Vinnie been clockin'
You a new jack sucker, Vinnie been rockin'
I ain't hear you sucker, come a little closer
Close enough so I can rock you with a mini roaster (x2)

(Chorus)
These the last words of a nigga who's stressed
Shit on my mind, like "Can I live?", am I goin through death?
My first rhyme could be my last dependin on who's next in God's book nigga
I'm not shook, I'mma take it like a crook nigga
Slash on someone in the flesh, my roach lit
Got me spazzin and holdin my breath, I won't quit
Goin fast down a one way stretch in God's book nigga
I'm not shook I'mma take it like a crook nigga
Come on!
I'm a crook nigga, I'm a I'm a crook nigga (2x)

[Doap Nixon]
Everything ain't always what it seems
Either I blow steam, or fall back and blow cream
Cuz, the left hand's for the position of mic
I made a nigga wet himself when the mission ain't right
I'm on some OG shit, go fishin' at night
Scrub the jewels with toothpaste so the glisten is right
Fuckers, I'm on a level that you can't ignore
I prefer a boxcutter til' your face start to drip and pour
Catch me and Reef eating on South Beach
Smackin' niggas so hard his head'll leak out meat
Salute me or you better speak out peace
Cuz cats smoke so much oil niggas leak out grease
We play everyday just like the weekend
Because of Doap Nix
And the A to the O to the T to the P in this bitch

[Celph Titled]
Surgeon General's Warning:
I'm surgically injuring informants to resemble invalid deformed kids
Satan's orphan born forced to contort ribs
Expand my land look what one golf course did
Nine irons and three woods, goons with the spikey bats
Ali Baba swords swoosh-shaped in the Nike bag (damn)
Ask around they say for real "I'ma a rider man"
Ladies love my sniper aim 'plus they like my tiger fangs'
Spiders came, Oh!, from my grave when I rose out
Looked at the sphinx and, I chiseled the nose out
Fo'shizzle there's no doubt, the military unit of the Tibetan black magicians
Is here to make exact incisions
With radioactive equipment
And have you stabbed quick through your cheek flesh like we bass fishing
So crabs listen, there is no ass kissin'
Sloppy with my work, do my dirt with my mask missin'

[King Magnetic]
Flex guns like a shirtless jock
Half black, half animal cracker minus the circus box
I'm felt like Murs with the Slug
Emerge with a buzz
My words nerd's merged with a thug
Pride added to poverty equals robbery
Over larder weed with more traffic than Joggasee (??)
I'll eat your God degree, Allah decree
Stay in the cut like words wrote across the crease
Magnetic and Vin Paz, we been spazzed
Live fast from a quick slash to a skin graft
I'm a jail dude
It's harder to come up on bail dude
I'm harder than stomaching jail food
It's part of dumb luck that fail you
Right when you need it most
Squeezin' throats, choked til' your Caesar's close
I'm the reason that the Eagle's close
Rough times tough lines
Number five with the ?? poach

[Demoz]
Yo, who wanna get stabbed and shot?
Dig a hole, let the casket drop
Norman Bates back, pass the Glock
Shoot his face when I pass the block
Tell the world suck a dick, dirty ass, and twat
Moz
Sick in the head, ask my pop
He dead, fuck if he gone nigga ask a cop
I'm tellin God how I feel if he ask or not
I roll with Outerspace call me astronaut
Kamach, Kenny the Kid, Reef, and King
Vinnie blew the whistle last minute, D is in
Double G's, xanny popper mixing weed and gin
Spanish fleet when I pop up, let the demons in
Terrorize your whole hood, dirty T's and Timbs
I'ma birth the whole game, let the semen in
Nigga
I'm the mothafuckin' reason when
Niggas snitch niggas die
Put ya spliffs in the skyBring the light to the dark, AOTP, yeah

[Verse 1: Reef the Lost Cauze]
I Self, Lord and Master
I'm not a rapper
The industry been in a nigga pockets, since Napster
So me explainin' why I'm still grinding, I don't have to
I'd sell my masters, if the cash come
Cause my girl need a new car and baby need Pampers
It's real shit, y'all never know about it ask us
Side jobs in retail, detail cars and ride trash trucks
Never complain, we never had much
The ends won't justify the means, it don't add up
Rap, work, and sell dope, now that's a mash-up
Kids say they wanna do this? I just crack up
I tell em stay in school, fool, you need a backup

[Verse 2: Doap Nixon]
Aye-o I'm blowin' brown every day to keep the stress down
And niggas that I seem to let 'round, they always let down
So I'm building a bunch of young niggas like Brett Brown
They all ballers, keeping niggas in check so when I
Big up my set I'm paying homage to Pharaohs
And when you hear me spit, acknowledge my vowels
It's probably foul
I never change the language for change
It's slang written
Half my life gambling heists to keep that thing with 'em
Suplex mangler, but it's a cold word baby
So I'm a North Face and Cumberland whore chasin'
So knuckle up or get cutted up
Or smacked with the butt of the gun, buttercup
For trying to fuck with us
Who dumb enough to try one of us?
We peelin' your girl off the grill of a Hummer truck, when the sun come up
Who one of us? Raise your face to the skies
And watch the mortals make way for the return of the Gods
Pharaohs

[Hook] [x2]
AOTP cock the latch back clack clack
OPG got the straps in the back pack
Bodies in the trunk of the '96 hatch-back
Punch you in the face, slap your man out his snap back

[Verse 3: Blacastan]
I'm John Allen Muhammad living out of a van
Picking off bystanders with a rifle in hand
I'm demented, I'm a couple cards short of a full deck
I'm a liar, I'm the charismatic man in a pulpit
I'm AOTP, Demigods, JMT
A faith healer, healing through death on CD
I am not a role model, you should raise your own kids (come on)
I'm a dirty rap nigga with fruit flies in my crib
I'm strange, I'm deranged, I'm fascinated with death
I chain smoke cigarettes, I got terrible breath
The show's almost over, only two songs left
So cop a T-shirt, find the exit and step nigga

[Verse 4: Demoz]
Aye-o fuck being a good person
I'm in the hood workin'
Smoking shit to numb my pain
I don't know if you could nurse him
Doctors can't figure out what to do with him
Once upon a time, he used to have screws in him
Now Lucifer let loose in me
They not used to me
I'm not what I used to be
I used to be a young nigga, silly state of mind
Now I'm just a nigga going crazy like he facing time (uhh)
I'm from the hood where the young die
If you don't lay low, you get hung high
Nigga I lay low, and still hang high
In my head, shit only hit the fan when your man die
I take a sip of this liquor inspired with hearses
Nobody surviving, I smoke my weed out of Bible verses
Inspire churches to sin, what?
I inspire churches to bring niggas like me in, clear of my sins but

[Verse 5: Vinnie Paz]
Why would you ever try to be god with me?
Why would you bother me, why don't you ever see prophecy?
Possibly honestly, Sodom, Gomorrah atrocity
Mephistopheles at the door to door, a monopoly
Why would you lie to me? Why would you see the Allah in me?
Am I the only one who see comedy in monogamy?
I lay back, eat mozzarella and sliced swordfish
Put my feet up on the table in my nice office
Black mask, black millimeter, white Porsches
Every single rhyme Vinnie write, type gorgeous

Hahahahaha listen, Pistolero Pazzie

[Hook x2][Verse 1:Doap Nixon]

Left check, right check, brass knuckles, knife check
Nine double-m, black talons that ? check
Sour diesel, purple haze ? cloned
Two albums, both classics, my fans is grown
City life ain’t nothing like the south dude
How this nigga run his mouth with a missing tooth?
Three masters, we all got padawans
Dudes trying to bust heat, we got bag of bombs
You got word that Celph got the south hitting
Ap’s up top, me I’m right in the middle
And I got these rappers trying to bite my flow
Lying to their fans like they’re really getting dough
I’m Richard Pryor in his first movie
I’m a vet, salute me, rap raw like sushi
We the three hottest niggas in the game now
Cock it back bang let it bang now

[Verse 2:Apathy]

Bionic demonic evolution pollution of the soul gold-plated
Nickel-plated pistol that’s located
Sedated, straitjacket, I traffic narcotics
I’m cosmic, cookie-cutter pussy up or cut her I’m robotic
Magical when I’m pouring all these potions in the pot
Fucked up from all those years pops smoked pot, coke, and microdots
My sniper on the roof don’t blink from rifle shots
Ninja Gaiden moves when I scale up walls
Throw Chinese stars when I rhyme these bars
Spit-shine these scars, AP stand large
Leave your head covered red like Van Halen guitars
I’m 80’s, kinda like Charles In Charge
New Edition and DeBarge and DeLorean cars
We harvest human bodies like alien farms
I’ll leave cuts on guts but not caesarian scars

[Verse 3:Celph Titled]

I stay cap-peeling 'em, rap villain with a cape and cane
Passenger 57 bringing snakes on a plane
Sit you in the motherfucking exit row seat, blow the door off
Watch you soar, off the Testarossa speed
The metronome to my beat’s erratic like jungle music
I put a hole in your dome, don’t need a gun to do it
Yeah I’m fucking stupid
The Army of the Gods is certified, I cosign everyone I’m in a group with
I get it popping in here, yes Redenbacher is here
Robocop, Clarence Boddicker’s here
Seems like everybody’s scared whenever flying iron disperse
Pints will squirt, now your polo rugby is a Hawaiian shirt
And I insert sharp knives to your chestplate
You will shit without Kaopectate
We don’t spectate opening acts cause they probably suck
We slice through your crew, show you how to make a posse cut[Planetary]
Put me in the booth and I'll brodie your wave files
You still getting booed at the open mic like 8 Mile
You still actin' like spoken word is serious
I laugh at you fag-niggas with dyed hair and pierced lips
What kinda nigga from the hood is you?
I could name fifty niggas that's as good as you
But a nigga like Plan man I'm better than all of 'em
I make em quit, now their baby moms' is callin' for em
Askin me where they baby pop at
That nigga he at the sink cleanin' my White Sox hat, bitch!
I tell em call you back in a minute
Cause when he finish he gotta brush my dunks so vintage
I'm in this rap game for the spinach
My food-for-thought is like serving fresh lettuce to niggas
I'm the chef and I'm cooking up Def Jams
Broad street bully cut the check for ten grand

[Doap Nixon]
I made a promise that I never get high
I ain't scared of death, I'm scared to live wantin' to die
Cause the one-twenty opened my eyes
The Koran molded me
The Bible told me what's a disguise
But, I broke lights like they need to be fixed
And had a thought pattern process that D and B's rich
But, the block chirped, hid work in the trash-can
I rip a nigga off and lay low in the badlands (Let me get that, nigga)
Stay bent off of what poppy done sold me
We all forced to hold heat, smokin the gold tree
So knowledge knowledge till the seven-fifteen-four
Vinnie Paz, Planetary, Reef the Lost Cauze
Kamach, my nigga Crypt and Demoz
Apathy, Celph Titled and King Syze
We all 'bout to put this game in a frenzy
And the chain's slight frost like the air in the Benzy

[Hook: Demoz]
I can feel a breeze through the leaves when D's passin' me by
You can breathe you can bleed but please wrap me a nine on Black Christmas
I need a gun with bullets on black Christmas, black Christmas
Nigga look at me little B
My peeps askin' me why
I'm a G this is me, so please wrap me a nine on black Christmas
I need a gun with bullets on black Christmas, black Christmas

[Des Devious]
Yeah, yo, it's incredible the most
How a nigga flow just come so easy
Child's play to me home boy, please believe me
The way I formulate on time with metaphors, lines, and punchlines?
Sometimes the shit amaze me
Fall back with a spliff and admire my shit
Don't need you, got enough people on my dick
I speed through, breathe life on a track so slick
With sick shit, time's money so I must move quick
Epitome of rap
Never been clapped never been slapped up
Just one time, cold winter day in '79
I catch that guy, and I'ma beat him till my arm's numb
And stomp him like Lars did that drum on one, motherfucka!

[Demoz]
I once heard The Art of War is don't start a war
So I don't think you wanna ride like a carnivore
I mean carnival, excuse my French I'm on the floor
The blues and wet got me feelin' like I took a hallucinate
Blue is bent, L-Y who the truest yet
Blew the inf, brain fragments flyin' through the fence
Stupid is as stupid does
I ain't stupid cause
I rap like a motherfuckin' animal my blueish blood
Never spills, I wrap my hand around the bluest steel
Blew his grill like Foreman informants know who I kill
Ill, now get outta my face
Sorry officer, me no hablo ingles
Let me offer you, food for thought on a plate
Once you know the block hot you hit the fire escape
Get in get out, hit liars and snakes
Your birthday the only day you rely on the cake nigga!

[Hook: Demoz]
I can feel a breeze through the leaves when D's passin' me by
You can breathe you can bleed but please wrap me a nine on Black Christmas
I need a Gun with bullets on black Christmas, black Christmas
Nigga look at me little B
My peeps askin' me why
I'm a G this is me, so please wrap me a nine on black Christmas
I need a gun with bullets on black Christmas, black Christmas

[King Magnetic]
Army of T.P., honor of street thieves
The harmony of harm done to a beast-beat
I execute from hook to hook like a nice jab
And pain from pushers squeeze like my wife's hand
Slight tan, my homie Muslim like Fife's man
Pillow of kush, as if the kush is my life span
My product slip through the right hands like white sand
Those I kill for, can count on my right hand
Beef handled like blades in knife factories
Cut coke, cut bum niggas like nutso
This ain't a movie clip, it's a jewelry stick
Ever see me runnin'
You'll have to be like, "Who'd he hit?"
You knew he Vic, shit, still trusted him
Know a lotta robbers from bids, still fuck wit them
That don't mean they up in my crib, I'm still hustlin'
Anniversary nine-elven we still suffering!

[Vinnie Paz]
I'm a motherfuckin' monster, everything I'm spittin' is all real
Take a good look in my trunk and it's all steel (Yeah)
Ain't nobody in control it's Allah's will
The other trunk ain't filled with diesel, it's all krill
Arm leg leg arm head when the gods build
You the first devil with a plate when the hog's killed
You the first one to run from the war
You the first one to run from Vinnie's gun when it draw (Brat, brat!)
I left your whole team deaf when I spoke
Then I put your whole entire fuckin set in the yolk
Yeah, we ain't the motherfuckin set to provoke
Or else the last thing you see the fuckin deck of a boat!
Brat, brat!
Hahaha![Intro]

Die motherfuckers die - Scarface
AOTP shit nigga
Die, die, die
Die motherfuckers die - Scarface

[Verse 1: Planetary]

Top Gun of this rap shit
Cock guns to blast shit, nigga what's the meaning of that
Shit, scheming, a black Smith & Wesson, what's hood
I'm grown, now I gotta start protecting my goods
I gotta start protecting every one of my kids
I gotta start protecting everything I got in the crib (That's my shit)
I gotta have a fresh pair J's for the whizz
If not trees, if not that I ain't handle my bizz
A screwed up way to live
But that's me, follow my lead it is what it is (my niggas)
I hold steel in the hour of chaos
And hurdle through the base heads tryin' to just play with the odds
I'm not the type of nigga to claim god
But dog I heard you spit
Do't quit your day job
I've always been the cat to slave hard
Hoping that the dealer don't turn over the face card

[Verse 2: Doap Nixon]

Fuck the claps and cheers, all we want is respect
And ya'll fuckers are wild lame, yall ain't nothing to sweat, UH
Still certified greens and tan trees
Still in the hood like damp leaves and banshees
The last time they seen Vinnie Paz and kenny spaz
We was blazed up in a cab, waving a semi- mag
That was the time I dropped out of college
The god of law thought he would go on his own
Is still knowledge, knowledge
Kinda ridiculous the way I get in this shit
Some felt ignorant, me felt innocent
So for now on my gods you now strong
Niggas want war I get you murked by a wild jawn
The only reason I ain't on and my niggas is on
Is cuz I got stuck on the gold pot that I'm sitting on
Till I seen there wasn't nothing there
From my eyes to my ears I got stains of bloody tears

[Hook: Demoz]

AOTP, they know we be, O-N T-O-P
(Die mother fucker, die)
Fucking with these gentlemen, we run up in your residence, get you for your presidents
(Die mother fucker, die)
Make up the break up, I don't wanna wake up, If I don't got my cake up
(Die mother fucker, die)
AOTP, on top we be he he he he
(Die mother fucker, die)

[Verse 3: Demoz]

The psycho's back strong enough to push the Eifel back
Halloween mask, Michael's back
Stay in your lane, you no named niggas get lipo'd up
Lose weight when the rifle bust, I don't like you fucks
They want my life I want 5 mics, problem is I'm unsigned hyped
Fuck is the deal, give me life in the booth with no fucking appeal
I bet you my left lung they can't fuck with the skill
Bet you my right hand they gon' die in the trauma
It's the front street terrorist I ride like Osama
It's a thin line between a prick and a fool
But these faggots they keep acting like snitching is cool
Man these faggots they keep acting like I ain't a beast
Till their face is next to their sons under the beach
Food for the crabs mission accomplished nigga take it in blood
It's a wrap, my crew acting like Satan is loved

[Verse 4: Vinnie Paz]

I'm Jesus in reverse, the son of Satan with a fire arm
Water to blood, apocalyptic fire storm
You a sucka rapper, never know what side you on
I shoot my biscuit in the air until the sky is gone
A 16 of mine murder your entire song
9M submachine is long like your entire arm
I'm a loud mouth fucka not a quiet storm
I don't believe in an afterlife so once you die you gone
Never nothin soft, everythin' a violent song
Kanye West, gay rapper, thats when lines are drawn
Qwest hit me with a beat like he Italian mob
It ain't even beef no more, its Hillshire Farm
I ain't gonna leave your family any time to mourn
My clenched fist shows the power that's inside the palm
The same 'palm that was taking human lives in 'Nam
And I ain't stoppin it till' all these human lives are gone

[Hook]

[Outro: Vinnie Paz]

Cocksucker (hahaha)
Brat brat, yeah
Big Louis Doggs (yeah)
The genocide general (motherfucker)
Doap Nix (AOTP)
Demoz
Planetary
AOTP
Kwest on the beat
It ain't a game baby
Brap brap, hahaha
Cocksucker!

(Die, motherfucker die, die, die motherfucker die)[Hook]

This is the night I’m burning you alive
Right here and no one will hear your cries of fear
This is the night where I’m sure of your demise in my head
And I will be here to watch you die in fear

Live your life by a prayer, are you there, and do you care?
And I don’t care

[Verse 1]

You either a mark or a killer, me I’m as sharp as a splinter
As cold and harsh as the winters in the heart of December
My limericks ain’t hard to remember but harder to figure
I leave your carcass disfigured, dismembered then carve out your liver
And vital organs, rigor mortis, your corpse is
Niggas hard to record this
I’m thought-provoking with the logic of Vulcans
I’m not into sulking but soaking the bitch
I’m at sea with the sharks in the moat
And see if his princess carcass can float
Hearts will get broke, haunted by ghosts
The same old G in this game homie
Still bringing the pain like Sugar Shane Mosley
And you will light a candle to say a prayer
And cry in fear but you still die and I won’t care

[Verse 2]

Ain’t nobody dope as me
Unless you find him in the ill AOTP
So let the sinsemil no seeds, purple hairs blow
Xans in the tuck ? for the weirdos
Shake makes a lot so he’s letting his beard grow
His father gave his lessons over eighty-four years old
You can’t out-slick a fox with his own tricks
The barrel got spit same time that the chrome kicks
Your block’s hurting, niggas hoping to score soon
Fighting a case on Facebook and the courtroom
Can’t provide a dozen so we gonna need more room
Faggots still bugging so they gonna need more tombs

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

The more you sweat in peace time the less you bleed in war
I’m strapped with the four-pound cocked at the demon’s door
I ain’t trying to talk it out, it ain’t peace at all
I just pull them four-fours out when the Reaper call
Osama Vin Laden been rotten, walking strong
I’m hitting harder and smarter than a Sri Lankan bomb
I’m still using the weaponry that I copped at Nam
I’m still using telepathy from the father’s palm
It’s wild hard to explain what I do to rats
The hollow tips will have y’all dancing like Scoob and Scrap
Fuck a fair one, I let the Ruger clap
Now you rock an eyepatch like Ricky the Ruler’s back

[Verse 4]

It’s hot in the winter, cold in the summer, nigga the slumber
Overpower the thunder clap, y’all niggas going under
I cover the fort, hold down the team for sport
We need dope so Nixon get the fuck out of court
Yo block, we need the block sewed up and locked
Tell Maserati to shut down, the city is hot
Paz got the Glock, Planetary don’t stop
And it's nothin to malfunction your dungeon to rot
I’m something to watch, sort of like American Idol
I’m sheisty, that’s why I never swear on the Bible
I came to heal the sick and raise the dead
Cast out all the demons and introduce the plague

[Hook][Verse 1: Doap Nixon]
I’m in the kitchen cooking up bananas
Cameras on the roofs with the police scanners
By any means I’ma get these papers
Ride with a nigga or catch these vapors
Smooth melodic, cool water with butters on
Got beef with a nigga, save that for another song
Paz on point so he putting his brothers on
Steeze still the same, get you murked by a gutter jawn
Head in the streets cause the whip is spacious
Benz stretched out legs feel like a spaceship
Checks ain’t clear, I’m hitting y’all with the facts
If the check never came I’d hit your mom in the cap
Got the streets on smash, kilos on wax
Hundred pack on iTunes trying to make cream back
Yeah, the key’s cooked and the bricks is stove-top
It’s Chef Boyardee flipping nicks on your whole block

[Verse 2: Des Devious]
Yeah, born in the coldest winter, live and I die a sinner
And while I’m here I’m hustling, get paper with my niggas
Last of a dying breed, Pharaoh clique in your section
Before I leave my rest, kiss my Wess, load my weapon
Yeah that’s my right hand man, that fifty cal chrome
Off-safety when I roam, I ain’t never alone
Won’t catch a nigga slipping, won’t catch a nigga dipping
Cause I done mastered my high, you out your mind tripping
Yeah you can come and try, won’t be the smartest move
My bitch’ll pull the hammer and make it do what it do
Hustler, a son of one, bitch I’m a son of one
My money done got right, copped me another gun

[Verse 3: Crypt The Warchild]
These punk bitches get the bozak, the gas face
I feel like Earnhardt in his last race
This last lap in this game, I’ma hit the throttle
Syze, we celebrate new life, hit this bottle
Plan, I think the situation’s getting hairy
We make them say the Our Father and the Hail Mary
Scary how niggas turn Judas, no trust
I take it back to 5-6 when it was only us
Snakes slither in the grass in the killing field
So I maneuver through them by sitting in a bigger wheel
You’s a small time hustler, I’m a bigger deal
And that shit you spill gon’ be the shit that get you killed
Ready for war and I’m in it for the long haul
Throwing a molotov sidearm
Yeah, holding my fort with my pipes drawn
I kill everything when this mic’s on, believe it

[Hook: Demoz]
Ayo, f-u-c-k F-B-I cops and niggas who don’t like my shit
I tell them niggas suck a dirty dick with gonorrhea on the tip
I’m getting money courtesy of your bitch
Nigga it’s the Army of the Pharaohs, we hood American Idols
You don’t like us? You can suck my dick
I got a long rope and an oxy if you feeling suicidal
See that window? Hop out that bitch

[Verse 4: Demoz]
Now if you think you can easily be it then be it but see me not
I’m too heated and weeded to lose it so please be hot
They just fiending to be the most conceited team on the top
I’m leaning to be the most meanest as Biggie and Pac
Man these demons is dreaming like I just grieve for their spot
It’s easy to see they just want to be me cause I’m hot
So fuck my theme and my plot, smoking weed in your rock
And fall dummy to that casket cause they eat at you pop
You can believe it or not, I done sold weed to a cop
Caught a case, banged it and ran back to the fiends on my block
Fiends on my block? That’s logical, my flow is phenomenal
I put a couple dots on your block like dominoes
Red beaming them, I stay with my team and them
I keep four nines in the tuck like Steve and them
Diss my track, I'll diss like that
Cause when you shoot like a free-throw you miss like Shaq

[Verse 5: Planetary]
I’m from Killadelph county, the killers they all surround me
I’m losing my nigga slowly, Poppa Large, I make him proud of me
If you see Nemi then tell your people to see me
I’m here for the take and holding these streets down, believe me
My nigga Balo, I know your halo is platinum
I’ma see you at the gates, I’ll be rocking something ravishing
The Seven Sacraments made for the sacrificial
The baptismal of rap bristle to sacramental
My rap essentials is murder tracks and pencils
Gat utensils is only used for niggas acting simple
My syllable slice niggas like a cesarean
You killable right? I spit bars like a barbarian

[Verse 6: Reef The Lost Cauze]
I never thought I’d see the day hip hop would give birth to faggots
Mr. T mohawks and Urkel glasses, I’m from a hood where they rob cool kids
And I can’t wear skinny jeans cause my Glock’s too big
Yeah, I got the wildest style, death bears a childish smile
Beat you with soap in a sock, you a Private Pyle
I fear order, from green onions I peel quarters
What’s rap? I bump Foghat and Creedence Clearwater
Bad moon rising, I’m howling at the bitch
Haters baffled how he spent a thousand on the kicks
I get thousands just to spit, fuck all the drama shit
I don’t make statements, get bank statements and deposit slips
And it’s always gonna be this way
C-notes like study hall in tenth grade
To this day I fuck bitches and get paid
What’s piff? I got the green monster like Fenway
Mmmkay?

[Hook][Hook]

Been spending so much time underground
I guess my eyes adjusted
To the lack of light
I got covered in darkness
Covered in darkness

Hibernating always waiting for something new
Happinesss always ending
In the blink of an eye
There was no one attending
No one attending

[Verse 1]

First thing’s first, I Nixon, I gets money
And can’t never one of y’all take this s**t from me
They done tried but the ties became severed
Life got cold and darkness became pleasure
It’s sort of like a prison but can someone
Tell me the reason for living, what’s the mission?
Is it to grab more cash than the next man?
Pimps try and grab more ass than the next man
The hood’s like Thriller, could take a young kid
Off the football field and turn him into a killer, damn
It’s modern-day genocide when we die
They telling lies, the mystery, God lives in the sky
He’s in our heart, body, and spirit is energy
That co-exists with chemistry infinitely
If mind detect mind why we still talk babble
Plus degrees manifest ? master yeah

[Hook]

Been spending so much time underground
I guess my eyes adjusted
To the lack of light
I got covered in darkness
Covered in darkness

Hibernating always waiting for something new
Happinesss always ending
In the blink of an eye

No one attending

[Verse 2]

My city’s streets is so vicious better change in a hurry
Ain’t enough medication for the brains that worry
They’re making more and more pills like it’s fixing the problem
When the side effects is worse than the original problem
I’m so tired, my body is weak, I can’t sleep
And my feelings got me so confused I can’t speak
The government promise help, cutting our healthcare
The media’s the terrorist producing more self-fear
If Bin Laden did what he did, why he still breathing?
Contradicting stories like the Jews who killed Jesus
Soldiers leave for war, come back paraplegics
N****s fighting for a war and don’t care for the reason
That ain’t me, Lord, Cassius Clay, send me to prison
I should’ve listened when the older gods hit me with wisdom
Now my intuition’s telling me address the problems
With the hope to find solutions, build domestic values, c’mon

[Hook]

Been spending so much time underground
I guess my eyes adjusted
To the lack of light
I got covered in darkness
Covered in darkness

Hibernating always waiting for something new
Happinesss always ending
In the blink of an eye
There was no one attending
No one attending

[Verse 3]

I ain’t the preacher man in ‘09 selling you dreams
Or the gypsies on the television promising cream
I’m just building with my insight a vision of light
Painting pictures of intuition with precision and might
Put a dollar in a bum’s cup, later he eating
And the one who threw the dollar need a cup cause he’s leaking
While we work all week and get bent on the weekend
Only to wake up Monday morning in the 25th precinct
I’m trying to show this rap game that cats slain
And most never get a shot at life cause they dealing with wack aim
So they leave school and go hard in the crack game
Till they on the bus the greatest four with their backs changed[Intro]

An innocent man becomes a target of insanity as he steps into the crosshairs of a homicidal maniac with a need for revenge. Join us for a journey into the dark ? of a sick and twisted man. Join us for a journey into living hell

[Verse 1: Doap Nixon]
I feel lightning in my fingertips
? status, I give a nigga his wings bitch
Sleep on me, creep on me
Throw heat on me and I’m still gonna eat homie
Ill Bill from La Costra Nostra
Come sideways and we’ll both ? ya
Reef got the toaster, all I gotta do is whistle
And my bitches will smoke ya
What more can an underground rapper say?
How longer is these rappers gonna shine gay?
First up is 'Ye, second and third is Ye and my shit get no play
Where I’m from yo the jakes’ll murk ya
Act like you know and the fiends’ll jerk ya
Three classics under my belt
I just lost my comrade, I need something to melt

[Verse 2: Reef The Lost Cauze]
You think you BIG or 2Pac, you Nosferatu
I’m Ferragamos, murder, death, kill, homo
There’s no tomorrow, you won’t see the evening news
Rolling ? goose spin your top like Beetlejuice
We the truth, you talking about the cat you hit
Vicious as the blackened spears and sleep for half a year
You only bust your gat in air
Yeah you killing the clouds, having shootouts with the atmosphere
You the wackest here, unable for my rap to fear
You live fairy tales like glass slippers and magic mirrors
Who’s the fairest? Speak the language of Arabs
Sharif terror, send em to the sky like a chair lift
I’m original, never jocking y’all style
I steel a nigga, watch him slide like crocodile mile
I’m the wild child style vile since wild style
My guns go boom boom, your guns go pow pow

[Hook] {x2}
Deadly sins, we ain’t gonna pray for em
Ill Bill and Reef, I’mma spray for em
Five niggas that’s the best in the game
If the niggas ain’t fam then they feeling the flame

[Verse 3: King Magnetic]
It’s the heavy metal king, ain’t talking about the group though
Cause I’ll beat a gun charge right through the loop hole
Still down to shoot though, use em accordingly
They supported me, protected what my music afforded me
Disorderly, hold your beef, do them shits grimy
Literally down with Doap since the mid-90s
That’s right, face cringe from the syringe binge
And friends bend every rule that you made within
Aim and spray again, nothing like a window cleaner
Talk politics up close ?
Unfold in front of your eyes is binoculars
You need stock in the Apocalypse to rock with us
If not it’s AZ about to rock it up
Doing open heart surgery on your esophagus
I’mma die profitless like cult leaders
Aim assault heaters at adult divas throwing ?

[Verse 4:Ill Bill]
The game of thrones, stick you for your chains and clothes
Most rappers will suck dick for cocaine and dro
Ratchets explode, homie my chrome’ll rape your soul
Bring twelve plagues like Moses raining toads
Fuck your tongue wanted the blood
Hit you in the head with inaudible guns
Unfortunate ones get tortured and hung
The cult leader homie with the sorcerer’s tongue
Heavy Metal King influence your daughters and sons
You the topic of the song Shook Ones from Mobb Deep
I’m harder than bricks or football on concrete
Chilling in deadstock Jordans, millions of dead cops
Warnings, COs, informants
A hip hop Blackie Lawless, see more bodies than coroners
Unfamiliar aura, peel off shotties at foreigners
Grinning with pride, gorillas with militant minds
You win or you die, I’ll empty the clip in your eye

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Vinnie Paz]
There’s no oath to the goat, throw his body in the moat
Bucky fifty to windpipe, go for the throat
Pussy boy rappers better hold rosary close
Ain’t too many in my cypher that’s closer than Doap
Throw the faggot in the water, I hope that he float
Hope they ready for the slaughter, it’s  awfully close
I think he wanna kill himself I offer him rope
My vision is blurry, I’m seeing Allah through a scope
Boxcutter Paz John the Baptist
Ain’t nobody safe when I bomb you bastards
Only thing I think about is Lam and gat clips
Jordans, Grey Goose, bitches, and caskets
I’m an ugly motherfucker, give me a fat bitch
A dime is too much work, Vinnie is savage
Rob a motherfucker, rip through his assets
The 28 V rip through your cabbage[Doap Nixon]
Yeah, let's go
Hey Paz let's add on, my nigga
I'm talking about real talk
It's grown man shit right here
Straight from the heart, I'm talking about
When that acting super cool shit ain't working no more
You know what I'm saying?
Straight acting, niggas out here acting like gangstas 24/7
Niggas is fugazy
Yo..

The first time I heard rap I was so gassed
Cause back then, you could make an album with no cash
But nowadays everybody is so cool
You got niggas dropping out of school to learn Pro Tools
And this is all facts
I had to learn how to fall back
And stop wasting my time with small cats
They'll have you caught up in beef that you'll get killed for
Or caught up in the current, my nigga, that you ain't built for
And young Johns, getting loose with the cooch
Not understanding everything in this life started with you, but
I know this life is getting kind scary (Hang on)
When you only here you secondary
Man, you most necessary
And AOTP family is too strong
We hold our head high
Cause it's been down for too long
And once you get it, don't get it and boast, just do the knowledge
The greater the trial the greater the growth
That's real

[Planetary]
Man up, don't cry when the struggle approaches
Keep your self at arms reach
Away from haters and jokers
When it's time to be a man
Make your plan and face it
Things are gonna get better
Once you get out of the basement
The struggle only gonna sit
It lasts if you let it
The only way to overcome it
Is to shuffle through the negatives
If the positives allows you to proceed promptly
React on impulses and show your results calmly
Take it from a man that'll do for his family
More than he do for 'self
Who else could understand me
The streets are watching so the option is yours
The only way to make an effect
Is ride for the cause, my nigga (Yo!)

[Hook: Doap Nixon]
We gotta hang on, shorties is giving up
The hood's broke, cause the government don't give a fuck
Don't waste your whole life trying to get cheddar
Hold your head high and don't cry, shorty, it gets better
Don't live everyday praying' that hand's help
This is grown man shit, put in work for your damn self
Don't waste your whole life trying to get cheddar
Hold your head high and don't cry, homie, it gets better

[Demoz]
I'm come from a broken home
Bloody tears, no cameras
No footage of dad fucking with grandma
Now my daughter getting larger by the minute
Asking questions like, "Where my daddy?" I tell her
Baby, in this life we live, there's a life to give
To a upper hand, maybe pretty soon you'll understand that
I took a sip of your Bacardi my nigga (Oops!)
I was twevle, you was mad, look, I'm sorry my nigga (I'm sorry, my nigga)
And thanks for the party my nigga
You threw for my birthday at parks
Nothing will ever break us apart
Now I'm much bigger, life is much clearer
Percocet abuse and dumbing zanis in my syrup
'Till I'm in the Grammys with a Shakira look-alike
Hook's is right, I don't wanna be a crip tonight...
Nope, hope a major label look tonight
Cause I don't wanna have to strong arm you and get booked tonight

[Vinnie Paz]
Call it the hood or gutter
For all they looking for is a good mother
But it ain't none of them that's left
They took the good from her
It ain't safe no more, the street is Vietnam
The older guards on their dean
Trying to keep it calm
The streets rough out here, it's tough out here
And young bols they don't give a fuck out here (Damn)
But the government the one who put the crack in hoods
We gonna start a revolution, take it back for good
And I don't give a motherfuck about the police
They the reason every single ghetto having no peace
They putting poison in the water
I don't know why
This is for the little shorties hold your head and don't cry

[Hook: Doap Nixon]
We gotta hang on, shorties is giving up
The hood's broke, cause the government don't give a fuck
Don't waste your whole life trying to get cheddar
Hold your head high and don't cry, shortie, it gets better
Don't live everyday praying that hand's help
This is grown man shit, put in work for your damn self
Don't waste your whole life trying to get cheddar
Hold your head high and don't cry, homie, it gets better

Don't cry! (*Until the song fades*)[Jus Allah]
You might be the proud new father
I am their future martyr
Who slaughters like blood is the new water
Who's darker, who owns a tooth sharpener
Who's partner is a fool for his tool carver
No disputing, refutings, no eludings
Just shootings, feudings, no undoings
No diffusing, abusings, unexcusing
Shoestring removings becoming behooving
They don't pay me to kill but to stop killing
I don't hold my end of the deal, I should stop billing
Any lesser of an evil is not fulfilling
Don't text your house cleaner for a mop spilling
You're the trailer, teaser, I'm the feature
You ail, you're weaker, I am neither
I'm a leader, you're a cheater, deceiver
Easier, a receiver, breeder!

[Chief Kamachi]
Musical martyr who do it harder
Fresh to death, like a French funeral parlor
Church and Kamala hurts for the scholars
France holla, anywhere between the Earth and Shambhala
A black and white collar, grimy like crack pipes schwala
Trying to get a rap life dollar
Still spit it for shelltoes lottos with the velcros
It's killa code I dun did it till hell froze
Old school Guc jacket dirty elbows
My boombox blast the heavens
I talk shit, stuck bibles in the ass of reverends
They wonder what faith he is
Is he Muslim, Christian, or Atheist?
It don't matter, brain splatter just take a clip
Only present, ain't no way to escape the clique

[Vinnie Paz]
This a drama theme, you a faggot rapper drama queen
My body work is vicious quick enough to rock your spleen
Ain't nothin' funny sonny, even Vinnie's Glock is mean
Steady with a machete ready for me to chop your team
How is Bush still here, we shoulda been shot him
Hologram, Taliban, call me Vin Laden
You a new jack hustla, Vinnie been clockin'
You a new jack sucker, Vinnie been rockin'
I ain't hear you sucker, come a little closer
Close enough so I can rock you with a mini roaster (x2)

(Chorus)
These the last words of a nigga who's stressed
Shit on my mind, like "Can I live?", am I goin through death?
My first rhyme could be my last dependin on who's next in God's book nigga
I'm not shook, I'mma take it like a crook nigga
Slash on someone in the flesh, my roach lit
Got me spazzin and holdin my breath, I won't quit
Goin fast down a one way stretch in God's book nigga
I'm not shook I'mma take it like a crook nigga
Come on!
I'm a crook nigga, I'm a I'm a crook nigga (2x)

[Doap Nixon]
Everything ain't always what it seems
Either I blow steam, or fall back and blow cream
Cuz, the left hand's for the position of mic
I made a nigga wet himself when the mission ain't right
I'm on some OG shit, go fishin' at night
Scrub the jewels with toothpaste so the glisten is right
Fuckers, I'm on a level that you can't ignore
I prefer a boxcutter til' your face start to drip and pour
Catch me and Reef eating on South Beach
Smackin' niggas so hard his head'll leak out meat
Salute me or you better speak out peace
Cuz cats smoke so much oil niggas leak out grease
We play everyday just like the weekend
Because of Doap Nix
And the A to the O to the T to the P in this bitch

[Celph Titled]
Surgeon General's Warning:
I'm surgically injuring informants to resemble invalid deformed kids
Satan's orphan born forced to contort ribs
Expand my land look what one golf course did
Nine irons and three woods, goons with the spikey bats
Ali Baba swords swoosh-shaped in the Nike bag (damn)
Ask around they say for real "I'ma a rider man"
Ladies love my sniper aim 'plus they like my tiger fangs'
Spiders came, Oh!, from my grave when I rose out
Looked at the sphinx and, I chiseled the nose out
Fo'shizzle there's no doubt, the military unit of the Tibetan black magicians
Is here to make exact incisions
With radioactive equipment
And have you stabbed quick through your cheek flesh like we bass fishing
So crabs listen, there is no ass kissin'
Sloppy with my work, do my dirt with my mask missin'

[King Magnetic]
Flex guns like a shirtless jock
Half black, half animal cracker minus the circus box
I'm felt like Murs with the Slug
Emerge with a buzz
My words nerd's merged with a thug
Pride added to poverty equals robbery
Over larder weed with more traffic than Joggasee (??)
I'll eat your God degree, Allah decree
Stay in the cut like words wrote across the crease
Magnetic and Vin Paz, we been spazzed
Live fast from a quick slash to a skin graft
I'm a jail dude
It's harder to come up on bail dude
I'm harder than stomaching jail food
It's part of dumb luck that fail you
Right when you need it most
Squeezin' throats, choked til' your Caesar's close
I'm the reason that the Eagle's close
Rough times tough lines
Number five with the ?? poach

[Demoz]
Yo, who wanna get stabbed and shot?
Dig a hole, let the casket drop
Norman Bates back, pass the Glock
Shoot his face when I pass the block
Tell the world suck a dick, dirty ass, and twat
Moz
Sick in the head, ask my pop
He dead, fuck if he gone nigga ask a cop
I'm tellin God how I feel if he ask or not
I roll with Outerspace call me astronaut
Kamach, Kenny the Kid, Reef, and King
Vinnie blew the whistle last minute, D is in
Double G's, xanny popper mixing weed and gin
Spanish fleet when I pop up, let the demons in
Terrorize your whole hood, dirty T's and Timbs
I'ma birth the whole game, let the semen in
Nigga
I'm the mothafuckin' reason when
Niggas snitch niggas die
Put ya spliffs in the sky[Doap Nixon]
Uh, AOTP in this nigga
We don't rumble no more
I will take it back and disrespect a nigga sly to you before I pull that ratchet out
I'm going in
Uh...

Why you running with those lames that's tapped out
AOTP is front line with they macs out
And we don't rumble no more we comin' for war
I can hit from a long range don't care if you draw, and uh
Your eyes can't hit what they can't see
The M1, will melt a nigga wig like gangrene
And my trees is laced, bucket is half licked
My whole team got laced, half of them rich
The other half, originate from the best part
My right hook will leave your face covered with stretch-marks
When the swellin' go down, I'm tellin' ya clowns
The next step is fillin' up your melon with rounds, and uh
This is warfare, niggas in war gear
The AOTP, whole roster is all here
So fall back if you thinkin' of beefin' dog
I have my nigga Reef tie your moms to tree with barb

[Vinnie Paz]
The heavy metal king hold big shit I cock the heaters
Fat, bald, Puerto Ricans and the pasta eaters
Every move I make righteous, God Allah can see us
Peace to Abraham, Ishmael, Jacob, Jesus
Peace to every man, woman and child
To Mohammad and his glorious muezzin Bilal
You a swine eater that means all your energy foul
I'm a divine leader that means all my enemies bow
Yeah, but I ain't worried 'bout my enemies now
Even though at times my team can be incredibly wild
Don't attempt to ever get me to smile
Unless you wanna see what bullets do to heads of a child

[Planetary]
Behold a Pale Horse, y'all niggas is running a frail course (Get up!)
Ain't nothin' better than smellin' a stale corpse
Depicted, through your skeleton, wear elegant gloves
Purple blood on the fingers we lock from hell and above
The shell from a slug, turn grizzly bears into cubs
I make the birds fly south when we get it crunk in the club
Its nothin' to us, we bustin' militant verses
Belligerent syndicate, we spit the gift and the curses
You niggas worthless, I see you in the cypher with ya backpack
I'm way past that, may God strike ya
You sounded like you was reading, you was off-beat even
So you left with ya jaw leakin', I punished 'em all speakin'
We all beefin', niggas is running rampid
I curve verbs, the type that can serve Sampras
Y'all all infantile niggas in pampers
There's no cure to my sickness, I'm rap's cancer

[King Syze]
Lets get it crackin' what happened to all a y'all?
These QD stars got the people screaming for encore
We love raw, direct, uncut raw
And ya little particles we bound to dust and mop
Rap shit is my rope, and I ain't givin' a slack
Main question in the air man, who bringin' it back?
Gotta' be us, honestly "In God We Trust"
Apply pressure to the point and it will probably bust
Don't ever strike me, rollin' with Crypt that's more than likely
My Daily operation for the cash on the nightly
We all icy, hustle just for the grams
And breaking bread with the Pharaohs man, that's part of the plan
(It go, it go, it go)

[Demoz]
Food off your plate I scrape, I will never cater
Demoz tryin' to come up like a elevator
Green money, make paper, like I own a forest
He's funny, rap name should be Martin Lawrence
Never hated, I ain't tryin' say I never made it
Now my confidence is high like it's medicated
Call me a loose charm, I'm off the chain
I'm off the wall like in memory of my name
Versatile with the flow, they all the same
Ghetto can't walk right, I borrow the cane
Raincoat, umbrella stop all your rain
The industry a buffet, I eat all I can
So fuck if you next and fuck a duet
You niggas don't want to play me like Russian Roulette (Nope)
Man you DVD rappers soundin' comfortable, bet
This not an exercise tape, why you bustin' a sweat? (Nigga)(Intro) Doap
Yeah, AOTP, that's gangsta nigga
Sour Diesel the album is here
Yeah, uh

[Doap Nixon]
Tempo take, no shirt wit a cold smirk
A J A, runaway babe wit no shirt
Shady endeavors, you play me neva
I'mma product of my environment plus the 80's era
Buckin' half lip, gas spit when the grass lit
Sour Diesel trippin' off acid
That's the way my youngins play, they so loco
They transport their work in coffee beans from SoHo
Then what?
So what you think you tellin' us wit them jail threats
We know how to bids scrap, know how to live scrap
Dudes got bright ideas till they get wig clapped
This games just a big trap
Full of lil' kids rap
And it's all the same; they do a video, bling-bling
Then they go pawn their chains (Faggots)
So we don't care about y'all dudes that rap hard
Y'all names up in bright lights and mines is on a black card
That's gangsta nigga

[Demoz]
Ayo I fuck wit the beat like, wouldn't do this acapella
Bitches lookin' at my ways, they look like helicopter propellers
Fuck you mean you gettin' mozzarella
You payed a hundred for them jeans, them bitch's Rocafella
Hella weed in my dutch got me medicated
Meditated bitch, niggas hatin' cuz I'm educated
Street smart, we fart, nigga I am elevated
Floatin' like a helium baloon without my head inflated
This shit you rap about other niggas laugh about
I'm hungry so I'm clappin' out
Ya adam till the apple's out
Pills and apple juice, you pissin' I just have to ask
It's funny so I have to brag
You shittin' in a plastic bag
You'se a faggot man, I'll clap you like a Pakistan
A rope around ya neck
I'll hold you up like a traffic jam
Trash ya man if I'm Diesel wit the gun

[Reef the Lost Cauze]
Geah, Nixon, I got you baby, it's Cauze

Niggas is trash, betta step ya bars up
Broke outta jail, told 'em step their bars up
Ya haze is two base, step your jars up
Break ya face up chump, step your jaw up
All Chucks, my true flame niggas
Buss thru ya fuckin' wall like that Kool Aid nigga
Oh-yeah, the rest ought to know
I'm the best and you a flake like fresh fallin' snow
(Fuckin' flake ass chump, Hollywood niggas)
I'm 26 but in the game about five of those
Wars, tours, albums, got five of those
So pay homage, don't let me catch you poppin' shit
Cuz I'll kill ya career before you drop a disc
Who hot as this? Bring me to meet the nigga
I'll beast, battered, deep fried eat the nigga
King Kong, Chewbacca straight beastin' nigga
You talk greasy, but I just don't believe you niggas
Me neither, nope!

[Planetary]
Before I get caught by the Federally's
I move my family to Cali
You pushin' kush in the alley
I'm pushin' 08 Denali's
I'm ridin' out like a renegade
Reef rockin' shotty
We got a trunk full of hand grenades to dismantle ya body
You niggas rappin' like you ain't been potty trained
I got pots to piss in, niggas step ya polly game
Gas high, but fuck that, I don't ride the train
If I can't afford it, I start recordin' a lotta flame
(You know they had to invite Planet nigga!)
I'm Mike Jordan on top of my game
That's why I treat Nixon like Pippen
Cuz wit 'em they can't stop my reign
This shit gangsta, lemme explain that
Demoz will cut ya and leave you framed at the train tracks
You all bloody and tied up to the third rail
Cryin' for ya momma, but the drama where you first fell
You too feminine, take it to the grave witcha
When ya head detach, I'mma laugh and Paz take the pictures
This shit gangsta(Intro) Reef
Whadup Doap?
We here now, fuckin' onionheads
Fuckin' smash ya grandma wit a vase
I'll kick that bitch down a flight of steps
I'm tryna talk shit like you Doap
Yeah, AOTP, Lost Cauze, Doap Nix
I don't know if I was supposed to start rhymin' soon as the shit drop?
We gon' try it like this

[Reef the Lost Cauze]
Yo, let's get dirty like a thug hammerin' that buss
Like the sand and the dust, like raw blood on animal tusk
Niggas think they sweets till they strangled and slumped
Real niggas don't fold, I neva ran wit no chumps
They demandin' from us, dunn we need to go check that
Bring hell to any mothafucka who don't respect that
Their hands is vicious, right cross connect that
Try me and my fam, you stand where you left at
West P, till the death where I rep at
Youngaz is bangin' and sellin' crack where you rest at
This a death trap, but it's how we survive
Neva take my kindness for weakness, it's highly unwise
I show love to people who took advantage
Look me in my face and lie, now you gotta face the hammer
It's dead in ya face, I put 'em dead in his place
I'll leave 'em dead and disgrace
Cuz what he said outta his face
Talk shit, best believe we won't repeat that
It's Doap Nix and Lost Cauze
Sour Diesel, where the weed at?
Talk shit, best believe we won't repeat that
It's Doap Nix and Lost Cauze
Sour Diesel, where the weed at?

(Hook) Reef (Doap) 2x
Let's get dirty niggas
(From the block to the stage)
Let's get dirty niggas
(From the Glock to the guage)
Let's get dirty niggas
(From the corners that pitch)
(To the kids out the 'burbs lovin' life cuz they rich)

[Demoz]
Ayo, keep a nine on you and watch niggas that learn off you
Keep ya mind open cuz mothafuckaz will turn on you
It's funny how I put my words together
I burn the track like Nascar that's how I earn my cheddar
You earn plaques off a simple raps
Look I can't go commercial I done been thru scraps
Try turn on me, neva see me talkin' to rats
If it's my turn to burn I'll think the coffin is wack
Put an urn on me, keep my name outta ya mouth
If ya man a bitch keep his date outta my house
Cuz I'll turn on you
Look my flow been past you, neva try to test me
I'm so ready, nigga ask whoeva
And my hood's shady, still bars couldn't save me
Born crazy, I was torn as a baby
My pops left me, so my postbox empty
Box lefty, right hand Glock empty
Do not tempt me

(Hook) Reef (Doap) 2x

[Doap Nixon]
Blocka!!!!! Hit 'em up, give it up
And everything in the crib, we bout to split up
The break is over for the glarin' spittin'
The hood needs me, niggas bout to handle they bizness
And the streets want Nixon to break jaws
For that change, I'mma give more bars then the state charge
Still smack niggas for eight bars
Got vets in the game, tellin' me it's bout time that I take charge
So suck it up, or see the butt of the ratchet
Helly Hansen and Gore-Tex tucked under the jacket
I'mma made men and I'm not from SP
But I still drag ya ass 50 miles on a Jet-ski
Nickname Nicko Pesci, been around killers
Spendin' their days gettin' pickled off wet leaves
So show love or show ya pistol
You went out like a puss'
So I'mma cock it back then kiss you
And Reef knows right where to put you
Somewhere out in South Philly
What's ill ain't nobody gon' miss you
Yo it's QD and AOTP
Add D O A P and Reef the nigga that spells beef

(Hook) Reef (Doap) 2x[Scratching]
Things are done different in my zip code
If you think I'm joking you're sadly mistaken
You wanna rumble? Well you can get crumbled
Today will be the grand opening of your chest

Things are done different in my zip code
If you think I'm joking you're sadly mistaken
You wanna rumble? Well you can get crumbled
Today will be the grand opening of your chest

[Verse 1:Planetary]
Severe rap, fear that, Philly bring the beards back
Trigger like a fish make a nigga change the beer tap
Grand opening, ready for that biznap
Streets full of blood, you ain't letting your kids out
I make a rapper wig out from the lyrics
They can't see me, I'm a spirit born to be fearless
I'm a promoter I'm colden days, shoot like a soldier blade
Throw a fit quick, probably break your fucking shoulder blades
It's only right I spit this verse on a cold night
Came to bring the flame and burn your rep for your whole life
I'm so nice competition is dead weight
A head case can't get my fucking head straight
My shit spit critical like a fed case
Crazy, got you niggas huffing that lead base
Massive meltdown, bring the red tape
Pharaoh clique rap keeping my breath break

[Hook:]
[Scratching]
Things are done different in my zip code
If you think I'm joking you're sadly mistaken
You wanna rumble? Well you can get crumbled
Today will be the grand opening of your chest

*Scratching*
Things are done different in my zip code
If you think I’m joking you’re sadly mistaken
You wanna rumble? Well you can get crumbled
Today will be the grand opening of your chest

[Verse 2:Celph Titled]
When the beef heat up it’ll pop the meat thermometer
Head on collision put your teeth full speed in the speedometer
The rapper rappers hate the most, my career blasting off
Cause I went underground platinum with The Gatalog
Four discs of torturer shit
And when I’m with my Pharaoh counterparts you get hit with the poisonous whip
My brother Doap Nixon the flow sickening
We put a bow on an opponent’s forehead cause the dork said he’s so gifted
(Oh no he didn’t) well yes I did
I’m wild like an orangutan mixed with a gang banging Mexican
Shining like the aurora borealis is
Swung so many nunchucks with my my thumb tucked my palm developed callouses
Armed with 40 calibers I will give you paralysis
We just set a date to bullet holes and mark your calendars
Huh I’m just honest so you can save your comments
Eat you for a cheap dinner like I just ate Ramen

[Hook]

[Verse 3:Doap Nixon]
Let's go, don't bang with me, fuckface get your shirt wet
Drunk monks sing lullabies with cursed vets
They tell me to stay strong when I feel weak
That's why I'm this monster when I kill beats
From Flyers to Bruins I'm with Elijah with ruins
My head wrapped but got ties with the Jewish
Yeah so pay homage cause I'm so on my own thing
It's like TNT when me and a microphone mix
Nothing but bangers added with anger
That means you can find me on your corner with bangers
I'm tired of these niggas yelling that they got shit
It ain't worth nothing when you step in a moshpit
My body shots will loosen up your bowels
My right hook will spin your wig around like an owl
So I really don't care when you tell me I'm foul
Cause the kid got class with incredible style[Intro: Chief Kamachi]
Yeah, uh, yeah
We back y'all
Uh, AOTP
This was what y'all's was waiting for, right?
Yeah, nothing but that classic, classic... nothing but that classic, classic

[Verse 1: Chief Kamachi]
Yeah, yo
I stay strolling with Crypt
My opening 'graph like the smoke from a fifth
Cup of gin, devilish grin, bodies cozy and stiff
It's the messiah, think the black Moses of myth
I hold the staff and turn snakes into Netherland piff
I spit the 'glyphics and the mystics, you know what it give
One eye, bloodshot, on a pyramid tip
It's real energy, you a high school chemistry kit
The ease, the crease, get a whole energy lift
If your hate since '98, Kamachi and Hologram
And '07, he the reverend of the lawless land
I crack crosses, I'm here for the fall of man
AOTP, this is what you call a jam

[Verse 2: Demoz]

Nigga I'll leave you poked in the chest
If hip-hop is dead, call me ghost in the flesh
I'm close to the best
Kill your fucking man, have a toast to the death
Gotta be a ball game if I'm approaching the bench
Coke on the steps, po-po lock me up
Came home, now we just waiting on mafia
Jay I got you, Vinnie I see you
Crypt, King Size, Planetary, no need to
Display no one else's name, we all lethal
We came from a flame a hundred below evil
Nigga, I'll shoot you, I'll stab you
I'll knock your fucking jaw off your face if I smack you
Who's Luke, who's John, who's Paul, who's Matthew
I don't read the fucking Bible, nigga I just get at you
I'll make a bunch of crazy white boys kidnap you
Let you know this is real true life, no battle

[Hook: Demoz]
This is a gun ballad, motherfucker get lost
AOTP, every member is a boss
Can you pay the price when your life is the cost
Will you crack under pressure, take another loss
This is a gun ballad, motherfucker get lost
AOTP, every member is a boss
Can you pay the price when your life is the cost
Will you crack under pressure, take another loss
This is a gun ballad

[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]

You knew the white boy was wild nice
And then I stick the cooker to your ribs like fried rice
I got some cousins moving D at a wild price
That have the dope fiends lean mean when they pound spikes
The aim's sloppy dog, knife work mean
Stick it through the neck, pull it out
Knife work clean (ha ha ha ha)
The God's righteous, but I might serve fiends
And the four-fifth lift you out your iceberg jeans
I got a lot of young boys and they mad hungry
Murder, kill, shoot the place up, stab for me
This ain't the type of place you can survive God (not at all)
God don't live inside me, I live inside God

[Verse 4: Doap Nixon]

I ain't messing with nines, nah
I give them shits to my broad
I only mess with big shit, with the shoulders involved
Throw your body in the river so the odor dissolve
A headshot, leave your brain under the motor of your car
For real, you can bet your last, I split plenty wigs
It's KTK, Kenny the Kid
And I'm still in the hood, money, getting them packs off
Side of the barrel, dog
It feel like a scratch-off
Broad daylight, the hood's like Iraq
I got good aim, peephole niggas get eye-clapped
And we all on ease, all in greens, all in trees, and we all gon' squeeze
AOTP, niggas be running game on you
And I ain't talking about my money's gonna rain on you
I'm talking about the shit that dent up your car
Get mines and big phasers or I'm clipping your broad, faggot

[Hook: Demoz]
This is a gun ballad, motherfucker get lost
AOTP, every member is a boss
Can you pay the price when your life is the cost
Will you crack under pressure, take another loss
This is a gun ballad, motherfucker get lost
AOTP, every member is a boss
Can you pay the price when your life is the cost
Will you crack under pressure, take another loss
This is a gun ballad[INTRO:  SAMPLES]
I would move Heaven and Hell and anything in between to get to you. You wouldn’t be safe anywhere if I was mad at you. And that’s not bull; that’s truth. I’ve went up against people. You could pull a gun on me and if I’m mad at you I’m coming forward. You’d have to shoot me to stop me and if you don’t kill me… you’re stupid cause the next time you see me I will kill you

[VERSE 1:  PLANETARY]
They call us gorillas, we brawling, you in coffins with killers
You at the auction, I’m boss and smoking cigars at the dealer
Nigga I’m iller, count scrilla like casinos, only c-notes and over
I’m a cancer nigga no chemo
I’m dancing with satanic people, life is illegal
I’m heroin in the needle, my emotions are see-through
I’m evil, read your palm before dawn and spawn
Calm before the storm’s Katrina nigga, I’m drawn
Too much to handle in seconds I manhandle the peasants
Dismantle is pleasant, turn their Hell to my Heaven
I excel with my brethren, giving birth to nuclear weapons
I’m shooting your henchmen, every written verse is a lesson
I’m close to perfection with rap nigga I’m flawless
I’m God’s light, the type to illuminate in the darkness
Hand me the trophy, the gold medals and plaques
The torch is lit, I scorch your clique, nigga I’m back

[VERSE 2:  DEMOZ]
If I ain’t on my grind then I’m high trying to take your cheque
I done hustled on the hottest block and I ain’t break a sweat
AKs and TECs make them vacate a set
If he ain’t trying to pay his debt then we gotta spray his neck
You get laid to rest, nigga this is Murderville
Now smell the essence of the L, nigga this is Earth for real
Fuck a bitch, I’ll leave a nigga burnt for real
Signed to the streets but the judge ain’t served the deal
I just turn the wheel, hit em in the back pocket
Waiting for a pussy to creep, give him my best shot
Now sing a lullaby, sorry mama I’m mangled
And I’m about to catch a motherfucking homicide
This bitch named Karma got me going crazy and it’s fucking hot
I don’t wanna go away I’m like an addict in his fucking prime
Lit trying to get a hit, hungry for this money
If there’s tension in the room then you know it’s coming from me

[HOOK]

We pull them Glocks out, we about to make a change
One to wipe your block out, guaranteed to hit your frame
This’ll hit the vein, the official Pistol Gang
Pharaoh clique, a nigga sick, I’m quick enough to split your brain

We pull them Glocks out, we about to make a change
One to wipe your block out, guaranteed to hit your frame
This’ll hit the vein, the official Pistol Gang
Pharaoh clique, a nigga sick, I’m quick enough to split your brain

[VERSE 3:  VINNIE PAZ]
My rap will give you fucking brain cancer
Different question cousin same answer
Y’all motherfuckers made me scrap like I was Kane’s dancer
But there’s a method to my madness unusual still
They call me Pistol Pete Maravich moving the pill
We push a lot of everything but it’s usually krill
We use a lot of weaponry when you gruesomely killed
I thought a lot of destiny but it’s truthfully real
That could make a warrior like Zeus if he’s truthfully ill
I went to Hell and then I saw the abyss
Where dirtbag drink from the same water he piss
It’s Armageddon when I ball up the fist
It’s God Consciousness that started this remarkable gift
I was a martyr, it was horror when my father was sick
I was a monster, I would stomp you in the yard with a brick
I’m a survivor but I got the fucking charm of a pit
That just attacked you, now you got your fucking arm in his grip

[VERSE 4:  DOAP NIXON]
Niggas try to hate, we don’t hear the side talk
Them loud mouths, gotta hit em with the wide hook
Barack wants help, all my bodies buy em chalk
My niggas upstate squared with the fried shock
This for y’all wild out when your cell’s cracked
You know your time’s short when they trying to send your mail back
We catch bodies for the love of the block
I collect shit, I got a hammer and the glove of a cop
So while you hugging model jawns I was hugging the block
One for the money, two for the pop, three for a rock
Yeah say I’m steamed when I’m pulling a scam quick
Old Reservoir Dogs, lay your blood on the canvas
Quick to blow diesel but the game is sour
And you’s a pussy, where I’m from that’s the name of a coward
So when you get your weight up I’m already in power
Who wants war? My niggas fly planes into towers, Pharaohs

[HOOK]Yeah yeah yall hear it, motherfuckin Doap Nixon. Namsayin?
The cat with the lil kid voice but the grown man aim nigga

[Doap Nixon]
Yo whats the difference between the mentally gifted
And the ignorant gettin splifted?
It's that the ignorant could never get this
When i come like 50 egyptians gettin snipted
Leavin the features, hands lit up with life's pieces
Christians forever point fingers on who the beast is
But Doap's thesis: is it peace or is it grief
While you grit your teeth at the arabs in the middle east
Who be on they knees, slow motion as parallel
But my city done fell, victimized to who's the real
You count the chickens before they hatch
And count the thump of my steel, Move amongst the wise
Footprints and rough hoods (hoodlums) jellin (jealous)
You live money, you dumb shook, plus your crew
Yo we philly niggas, I say peace to bust at you
Never a disgusting crew, for lust for the jewels

[Jus Allah]
I keep blunts of cess in between my jaws
I keep chunks of flesh underneath my claws
Animal-like, rape a lady Aphrodite
I watch people bleed to tease my appetite
Slice your mug, we hand and knife thugs
That's so harcore, we banned from Fight Club
Raw, we're nightcrawlin blood alcoholics
Yall only hope is wooden stakes and garlic
Islamic, thinkin on a higher logic
Dressed in Arab garments on flyin carpets
Takin me to hovering starships
With high-powered aeronautics, to ride across cosmics
Lost in space, I pause to meditate
My souls energy causes walls to shake
Niggas stand clear when my land get spread
Cause my scarecrows got real klansmen heads

*Hook*
We came thru, invading your village with more weapons
Spies like us make you hit the floor for tension
Squad reppin', dont step into our section
We hard hittin', while you watch the god spittin

[Planet]
Yo I walk like egyptians around your pyramids
Here's a kid, that spits raw lyrics and splits your wig
Transform my right arm to hydrogen bombs
For my niggas who burn weed till they lighters is gone
Next level, complex rebel without a cause
Sleepy hollow, choppin your heads, riding a horse
The size of my sword, makes you see the eyes of the lord
In my den with a pen waiting for lions to roar
Loud cries, innocent beings being abducted
Alien life, Jesus Christ has constructed
Firewater, brought by the design author
Who holds the globe and patrols in a flying saucer
Mic enforcer, from Outerspace, yo the iller team
King Size and Doap Nix create a ill regime
I split the seam and emerge from a deep corral
And stay with respect like Pun's rest in peace mural

[Vinnie Paz]
Yo we the rawest rappers
If you started we gon' draw with clappers
There's no tommorrow cause we horror and we sharp as cactus
Thas why your jaw shatters, while my floor splatters
I do my dirt all by my lonely with the God Barakus
If you barkin at us, we dump shells
I dent em and bend em and dead em and send em to Hell!
You'll probly yell! you should cry for your dying wives
I severed em with several flying iron knives
Look in the lion's eyes.. and see darkness
Vinnie Paz, animal thug, just straight heartless
YALL GARBAGE, the gods remain conscious
Think Vinnie Paz is sick son? he nauseous
Cobra clutch, I'll blow your midn while you roll a dutch
And leave your children more Holier than Jehovah's touch
You know it's us, dead is how you'll find me
With money in the bank like Fox had in ????

*hook*

Paz:
Yow.. Yo Its Vinnie Paz baby. Takin yall mafackers to war
Doap Nix, the god Jus Allah, Plantetary baby
We takin yall mafackas to war, rippin hearts out. Namean? Namsayin?
Jedi Mind forever baby. What the fuckin deal?
Stoupe on the track u'namsayin? We bodyin motherfuckers
Whats the fuckin deal? Severin heads baby. FUCK YALL![Hook]

Nobody gets out alive until the cops arrive
It's a dirty job but somebody gotta do it
I cause more scare than Godzilla
Made the church people on your block wanna move out
Nobody gets out alive until the cops arrive
It's a dirty job but somebody gotta do it
My style is wild like pitbulls trapped in cages
Made the church people on your block wanna move out

[Verse 1: Crypt the Warchild]

Every rhyme I write is 25 to Life
Every rhyme you write don't even deserve a mic
Crossing international borders with a bomb threat
You motherfuckers haven't even left your block yet
You're a bitch, you're a ho, here's a prom dress
You wanna try to box with God it's no contest
So keep on thinking this shit is sweet
I'mma start a sandstorm and put you under the Middle East
You got it fucked up homie, I've been a beast
Reptilian tongue and my skin is deep
Rumor has it they say I'm thrown off
Until their limbs is everywhere, wigs is blown off

[Verse 2: Jus Allah]

Is that the cast of a death mass?
Is that water in a red glass?
Why, I'd thought you'd never ask, it's as legend has
There's a method to the mad, it's direct and fast
Disconnected from the guest it's a second-class
I have left a trail of debt, checks in the mail
Heads or tails, death prevails, never fails
I will never get derailed, that tip is stale
I will never get to hell, that ship has sailed
I'm refined, mastermind after cash and kind
Hand me gunshot pantomime, axe to grind
Pass into the sublime have a laxing time
Have a glass of wine, have your last act of kind

[Verse 3: Planetary]

Everything they say is irrelevant
I'm an element of rap that defines pure elegance
Elevating my residence, bigging them up
I'm in the hood rocking JMT shit in the truck
Not I Against I because I don't sleep on my stomach
I rock Heavy Metal Kings and watch the barrel of the gun twitch
You're talking dumb shit, hooting and hollering
I lift the cannon and wait for the bazooka to swallow them
I'mma do this regardless of them, I'm the original
Dirty rotten scoundrel surrounding your pinnacle
Block the perimeter, I'll hit you with the fadeaway
Got a bullet with your name on it for a rainy day

[Verse 4: Doap Nixon]

So many days, so many nights
So much money got fucked up, so many fights
So many niggas got knuckled down for no reason
So many cowards got guns but don't squeeze them
Yeah, that's just the way it is
I finally got a whiz that's ready to bless the sun with a hundred kids
So I can fall back, Ralph Lauren straw hat
Sour Diesel already showed you I'm all that
I won't stop trying to ride on you assholes
First week sales donated to Daschel
You think I'm bugging right?
But it's these zeros in my bank account
That got me saying "Nigga, floss it right"

[Verse 5: Vinnie Paz]

My brain's vast as the sky is
My heart doesn't know what die is
Pyromaniac rap, Vinnie starts fires
Only an ignorant thought ignored Osiris
And that's why the enemy lost and caught virus
Where I'm from Gods, Earths, 85ers
Y'all ain't got heat underneath it's all wires
I'm on some Samhain shit with bonfires
My whole team animal thug and born liars
You ain't aware of what any the 12 Tribes is
You're a devil who tell the enemy where God is

[Outro]

[Hook][Verse 1: Planetary]
Yeah! Yo, uh
A lot of rappers try approaching the omen
My poems will punish your people while I’m up at the podium
Pharaohs folding 'em, like washed clothes again
I'm a vulture when the flow go choke your kin
Broke, I leave most of them, slow, I keep my motionin'
Eye on the prize
I silence the wise, my lyrics make a scientist cry
Making a secret society expose their purpose
Making 'em unleash info and explode in my surface
I'm taking my time to birth this, rap entity earthless
It's show time, there's no time, be ready when the curtain split
I'm hurtin' shit, too powerful for painkillers
On the concrete jungle we walk like trained guerillas
Untamed, and my niggas is Kane, Kool G, Rakim, combined into one frame
We like the new mecca of immaculate rappers
Vinnie Paz, call the goons, now we back with the clappers

[Verse 2: Chief Kamachi]
Yo, remain silent, kill him with what I mentally says
Bloody Fez, choke you like an Indian rez
Kamach, animal Turk, sick with a cannibal smirk
Welcome, this where the murderers lurk
It's my mind, that make sure that the Sun can work
Scorch bodies, leave all of your gunmen hurt
Pharaoh sultans, create a serious cult jam
And my hand is where the tears of the pope ran
They stay watching like they keep me on a scope cam
I'm in Heaven with the angels that smoke grams
You need God, that's why the earth so damned
International, trying to get my flow banned
That's cool, if I don't kick these prayers
A lot of floods and fam' is gonna hit these years
Kamachi back on the chapel stairs
Open the clouds, let the thunder clap your ears

[Verse 3: King Syze]
You wanna put your money up? Then muthafucker then put it
For your family's sanity man, I wish that you wouldn't
Niggas got nice flows, just dont know where to put it
And I know your whole life your raps are edited footage
And y'all mixtape niggas couldn't see my plateaus
All up in my presence, while y'all actin' bashful
King Syze casting an ecliptic rap flow
Y'all little light niggas couldn't feed my shadows
From, city to city, intersection to section
But you reflexin', with or without a weapon
I'm always steppin', never scared
But always and forever prepared
Yeah the ones who drink gas man is revvin' their gears

[Verse 4: Reef the Lost Cauze]
You now rocking' with the foulest clique in the continent
Total dominance, rise to prominence
In my prime like Optimus, stand in astonishment
At this conglomerate, an axis of evil
I know where Osama is, he down in Camp David
Down and dirty like a damp basement
The champ must demand greatness
From himself, or be another contender
There's hundreds of niggas
Dead left under the river
From the days of slaves
To hurricanes in Orleans
See my people's graves floatin' amongst the waves
There's hell to pay, but
The devil don't take checks
I tried to send a message to God
His phone don't take texts
I need a new plan, a crook with knowledge
Times is hard homie, why I took them dollars
Man, my momma got a mortgage
And my little baby sister need books for college
I rob all of y'all

[Verse 5: Doap Nixon]
Hey, yo, they want the hood in here so they called me first
I give 'em rappers gatorade cause they ball with thirst, UH!
This is more than music
But these niggas is mad trash
That's why the stores refuse 'em
Yo, I'm out in Georgia, went straight to the block
I'm seein' cats motorcyclin' dawg, I'm doin the walk
I'm an O.G., call my Italian niggas a wop
Though their papers ain't right, but they got weight on the block
I love 'em uh
Hand to hand, see your hands ache
I drunk so much syrup dawg I stopped eatin' pancakes
Ya niggas cool dawg mine's absurd hot
Stop frontin' like you's a killer money, your nerves shot
Yo you's a Paxil nigga, dumpin' Zoloft in coffee
AOTP what exhaust be
Can't keep it gear, cause I'm blinging with F's
But I got my mind right so swing your shit to the left

[Verse 6: Demoz]
Nigga if I had 24 hours to live
Fuck 24 hours, gimme 24 seconds
Vin I'm drivin' off a bridge
Broken rib, no windshield, covered in kerosene
Gasoline tank filled to the top
Magazines of these phony rappers ripped in pieces
No priest is, strong enough to take me out of my zone
I broke Jesus, choke niggas who squeal
Rob niggas who steal, kill niggas who kill
I'm too sick for a pill
Man these niggas ain't real, they real fake
They say they a man but they fuckin' reveal snakes
That's when you put 'em in a truck with their grill taped
Rip in reverse then run into a steel gate
I'm a suicide driver, never been a liar
If I don't kill you later, I'mma kill you Mañana
You don't want no problems
You don't want no drama
Nigga I'mma take a trip with your baby momma, suicide driver

[Verse 7: Celph Titled]
Ya better cross your T's
Cause we'll dot your eyes
You can say that you specialize but pharaohs will optimize
Backstage will get a bitch back smacked there
The mac glare like dirty south pimp slap clap snares, YEAH!
Holy paragraphs, what kind of shit is that?
I'm Jesus in the flesh so this is motherfuckin' Christian rap
Y'all just Christmas wrap, must be the secret Santa
My reindeer aim near, pierce you with the antlers
I made 'em go easy, and called off the wolves on my AOTP radio CB
Cause y'all ain't worthy of grenades and RPGs
Slit throat, hope you float with sardines and seaweed
Cause this is C-E-L-P-H demonic symphony
Listen to the hell we make
And a year before your kids tenth birthday came
You didn't have to wait for candles on the cake to see the nine flame

[Verse 8: Vinnie Paz]
Respect a G, my clique clap at you incessantly
I lay back and drink alcohol excessively
It ain't a rapper that's alive today that's testing me
I got degrees in being ignorant and weaponry
A 40 oz and Dutch Master is the recipe
That's my shit there, that'll be the death of me
Give me a death mask, better yet an effigy
I understand the math of death and it's complexity
I understand how you was violently murked
I understand how you was raised under the lies of the church
But understand and recognize that I'm cursed
With the ability to end your fucking lives with a verse[Intro] x2

I don’t know what she’s doing now
Last I heard from her she said
She felt as if she should be dead
I guess in fact she usually does


[Verse 1: Planetary]

I never could understand the fact she ain’t returned my calls
I was the only one that I told her I loved her through all the flaws
I would always be the one to show her light in the tunnel
I swear to God I need her back, I know she’s lost in the jungle
I know she need me, can’t believe we grew apart so quick
She loved trees like me, the way the New Eras fit
She loved Tommy Hilfiger, Rugbys, and Adidas
A match made before Heaven, why the feelings have to leave us?
But they didn’t leave my heart so fast
I still wish I had her near and had a beer for her glass
Even though I know that’s her downfall from the past
Still wanna shop for old time sake if she asks
Little shot of Crown Royale, maybe 151
So if you see her let her know the plan to have us some fun
Well guess what? Today front page of the daily news
My queen betting the beam dead right ? what the fuck?

[Hook]

I don’t know what she’s doing now
Last I heard from her she said
She felt as if she should be dead
I guess in fact she usually does

[Verse 2: Doap Nixon]

Ever see a jawn so confused and assed out?
She’ll suck any dude off chasing the cash route
She went from pompoms to kine bud
I watched the innocence transform, obsession to buying drugs
Little Tooty was a cutie, I swear God
Carmel complexion, good grade with a hair bob
Ten years later now she’s bobbing to head jobs
In and out of strip clubs like a career job
And she can’t see that she’s killing herself
Cause a couple dollars got this drunk feeling herself
It’s ill how this little girl could be ruthless
She can make a nigga with three degrees look stupid
She even tried to trick a couple dollars from Cupid
Emotionally it'll drain your ass out till you’re useless
The price is high when you wanna ride
With a jawn that’s suicide, she’s a suicide, c’mon

[Hook]

I don’t know what she’s doing now
Last I heard from her she said
She felt as if she should be dead
I guess in fact she usually does

[Verse 3: Apathy]

She said I must confess it turns me on when I cut my flesh
There’s nothing left, I’m hollow, I’ll follow death
If it’s a change from the mundane Mondays
You know my pain, I’m empty inside, my veins pump Novocaine
Sometimes I feel like life isn’t real
And my brain is too busy and my mind don’t ever heal
I could never shut it off so I’d rather shut it down
Do it right the first time, I ain’t trying to fuck around
And she smiles for her friends but the smile is a mask
Any memories of happiness are filed in the past
I can sit in my garage foot revving on the gas
A slash and a gasp or a violent blast
I don’t believe in Hell unless it’s what I’m in
I wanna free my soul, straight jump out of my skin
She exhaled and sighed, eyes opened wide
Suicide, it’s a suicide BUH DAH BUH BUH

[Outro]

I don’t know what she’s doing now
Last I heard from her she said
She felt as if she should be dead
I guess in fact she usually does

It’s so hard for me to explain
I guess she has a strange approach
It makes her seem beyond reproach
Until you find out what she is
