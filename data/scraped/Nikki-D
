Daddy's little girl, but not the girl that daddy knew
Daddy never had a clue of what his little girl would do
A drifter, swift to open up and get with ya
A pocket full of dreams, as for my love - forget ya
I never concentrated on the fact that I'm loved, scheme for scheme
And things that would lead me to a pipe dream
Picture it, yes, I'm daddy's little girl
I never asked for nothin, now it's a string of pearls
My chances are thin, could I win with a substance?
A princess with a smile, but my sweetness was sort of grim
I never fought the feelin that I had to be wild
Cause in my mind I was a mature child
But I could't hurt daddy, I played the role
But on the sneak tip, I was massagin his soul
Nikki had to be free, you see, I had to be me
Or life just wouldn't flow through correctly
Being daddy's little girl

(What daddy don't know won't hurt him)
But I'm daddy's little girl

[ VERSE 2 ]
Daddy'd always tuck me in bed and kiss me goodnight
Said, "Nikki, sleep tight," then turn off the light
And when he goes away on a business trip
I flip, lose my grip - party time - ah shit!
Tell the girls, split the duty, one go pick up the booze
My other half, move your ass and go spread the news
The party went on, lasted all night long
Song after song (to the break of dawn)
Then watch some nasty porns in the morn'
My body got warm, hmm - from gettin freaky with Vaughn
Sexin like crazy, my body amazed me
By takin a chance with a man that didn't faze me
A night so hectic, a bit unexpected
Before I made love, I shoulda been protected
Cause now I'm in a jam with this careless punk
And in about 3 months my stomach will be plump
Trouble, yes, I'm in the hot seat now
Tell my pops? No way, no how
It'll break his heart, wreck his whole world
To have to grow up quick - daddy's little girl
(What daddy don't know won't hurt him)
But I'm daddy's little girl

[ VERSE 3 ]
Neighbors asked could he trust me, yeah, daddy loves me
Cause I can feel it in his arms strong when he hugs me
But there comes a time when his angel must spread her wings
So I bow my head and get deep into the swing of things
Sort of raunchy I must be, cause mama knew
Every time I skipped school mama sat home and sang the blues
Now I regret the day that daddy let me out to play
But I'm a woman now, so let's keep it this way
Daddy's little girl

(What daddy don't know won't hurt him)
But I'm daddy's little girl[10 second convo between the two to start]

[Chorus: Apache] + (Nikki D)
WHO FREAKED WHO? (Nigga I freaked you)
WHO FREAKED WHO? Bitch I freaked you

WHO FREAKED WHO? Ha-ha, that's not true

[Apache] + (Nikki D)
I know who freaked who (yeah nigga) that's a stupid-ass question
I freaked you and taught that pussy a lesson (heh)
You must admit I got the good shit I was way up in it
And when I licked the clit you came for 20 minutes (mm-hmm)
Sweat, moans and groans, and the sex aroma
Fill the room, I'm done hon, then left you in a coma (what?)
It begin in candlelight, you try to fight and tussle
Now you daydream and fiend for my love muscle (sure!)
Is it love or lust, pleasure or pride
If I can't hit bottom I try to fuck up one of the sides (yeah right)
You found my spot, got on top, tried to twist and twirl
Fuck "Daddy," now your Apache's Little Girl (whatever!)
Time for a spankin, but I'll take head instead
I fuck so well I had seatbelts put on my bed (yeahh)
Don't be a dummy, buckle up I won't cum too fast (uhh)
But believe you'll need a cast for that fat ass

[Nikki D] + (Apache)
Huh, you ain't all that, your dick stayed the softest (what?)
Couldn't find pussy in a gynecologyst's office (he he he)
When we kissed, you touched tits, started a sex dual
You can't hang, I dropped the drawers and you started to drool (nah)
I'll admit, the body's fit and quite sexable (yeah)
I put my ankles on your neck because I'm flexible (uh-huh)
I'll make you scream when you nut cause you're full of that
So what your dick is big I had to show you where to put it at (don't be lyin)
Don't be shy, I'll treat you real good of course
Punch in your code and get rode like a fuckin horse (uh-huh)
Fuckin the way I do, it takes nuff guts (ha ha)
And when I'm done you need a tourniquet put on your nuts (ha ha ha!)
We play the game, find the hot spot, it's not up top
Follow the flow, lick 'em low, and it's hard as a rock (ahh shit)
Layin me, you lose your mind, don't know what to do (what?)
Who freaked who? (uh-huh) I fucked and freaked you (nah)

[Chorus: Apache] + (Nikki D)
WHO FREAKED WHO? Yo bitch I freaked you

WHO FREAKED WHO? Bitch you know that ain't true

WHO FREAKED WHO? Bitch, I freaked you
WHO FREAKED WHO? (Nigga bring that dick, more dick)
WHO FREAKED WHO? Yeahhh, more dick for you
WHO FREAKED WHO? (Well motherfucker freaky too)

[Nikki D] + (Apache)
Yeah, ain't nothin more pleasin than ass when you need it
Over 17 so don't PG-13 it
I can find a freak and fuck around ya whole crew
But I'ma use you, then do you, maybe even screw you (What? You buggin)
Throw my back against the wall and watch me slide to the floor
Pull my panties to my knees and striptease like a whore (daaamn)
Try you out for size, put your head between these thighs
Lick it lovely motherfucker see this coochie ain't shy
Watch me bend it, spin it, by now the dick is in it
Pushin butoons and I'm lovin every fuckin minute
If you grabbin for sheets yeah I'm grabbin them ass cheeks
Dick nice and hard, hey the pussy's on me
Ahhhh-hahh; the nigga tried to stroke it
Ahhhh-hahh; the nigga tried to poke it
Ahhhh-hahh; the nigga almost broke it
Ahhhh-hahh; but the pussy just smoked it

[Apache] + (Nikki D)
I must admit you're a great fuck but then again (I know)
I'll suck your pussy 'til your forehead caves in
All I need is whip cream, a dream gets strung
While you pull on my braids I'll tickle your nips with my tongue
You're on the menu, I'm hungry, you're the breakfast miss
Then I'll stick my dick between your big breasteses
You pop shit, I pop coochies, you're not the last
Pretty soon you'll have my name tattooed on your ass
Don't get sad or mad, don't fuss or fight
Give me a blunt a bottle of hooch and I'll fuck all night
I'm the freak of the week I'll fuck you any place
In a hooptie, a bus, or the fire escape
Need I say more, should I go on, let me continue
I try to go deep and put my nuts all up in you
Fuckin with me, you lose your mind, don't know what to do
Who freaked who?  I fucked and freaked you

It's shop time, in line, hurry on the quickness
Couch gorillas, you all need fitness
Word up, word up, kick out the dead presidents
All nightmares and Elm Street residents
Come on down, there's nothin wrong with that
But when Booga Bears do it - it's wack
In fact, I was in the shop the other day
Girls, hear me out, okay?
Reading Essence magazines
The latest fashions, adults and teens
Walkman kicks with the Jam that's Def
I see a female with a mask as I glance to the left
Slide to get my nails done
A manicure for sure - huh, can ya dig it, hon?
Suddenly the girl's mask came down
Grill piece looks ill, skips town
Pieces of skin were here, there, everywhere
A horrorflick and scare
Why do so much when it shouldn't be done?
There's someone for everyone
No, you had to go overboard
Lipstick, but lips got cold sores
Next time you need a fix-up, don't mix up the chop shop
Honey, you need the beauty shoop

Now fishlip with lipstick don't match
Caked up make-up makes up the monster mash
Splash bubblebath, don't laugh
Not the natural look, but the truth rises to the top
Chop into the beauty shop flock, don't drop
Look in deep skin, then stop
If you see no wins, don't spend your ends
On those millions of hundreds, or even tens
Of pairs of pieces of horse hairs, tear upon
Ashes of trashes of where they shared food
Don't be rude, let self rule
Who'll be cool in the midst of confused
With this on the mind at the end of the mop
Clean it up please, at the beauty shop

Artificial everything, sorry, Mister
How could you do your generical set-up?
And look faked up walkin the street lookin chopped up
Material's a thing you choose to get to strike a pose
Get cosmetic ears and get a cosmetic nose
No Siree, because you look wack, buddy
If loooks were makin paper, you would be broke and ugly
Berries are suckin, yo, I wish you good luck
Walkin up the street and still your face looks fucked
Ain't no misbehavin, get outta here
You look like a ghost, alakazaam, disappear
Go on, keep thinkin you're the cream of the crop

When I make a move, you better be at a stand-still
I'm holdin up the banner for the annual mic drill
Mistress of the rhyme, Sever pick up the drum stick
And hit you with a rhythm only Nikki can deal with
See, this is a different phase, and you won't be gettin fazed
You ran your mouth, no doubt, I'm on a rampage
Damned if I'll be good, I turn this track to a gangster
And roll up on the bitties who are jokes and pranksters
Step to the crowd, work the mic like a symphony
Steady rhymin with conviction, let's see who can get next to me
If I'd get deeper, you would drown, it's best to pull out now
Searchin for a remedy to get rid of me, no how
You be a memory mimickin me, cause you got bold
Suckers sippin on soup, gold tooth, put it on hold
Cold shootin the gift while others riffin a dream
You can base if you want, but I'm lettin off steam

Shootin the gift, lettin, lettin off
Shootin the gift, lettin, lettin off steam	(4x)

[ VERSE 2 ]
You wanna know the star status when I walk in the studio?
A mic's there, tracks spare, and I'm ready to do me some
A trooper gettin ready for a real live renegade
Waitin for a rookie with a mic and a bad name
So step into my dome, you be a victim of megablast
True trendsetter puttin rhymes on a higher raft
Rough be the look, pullin sturdy the mic stand
Fiendin for a battle? Take it up with my fans
Go 'head and call me a rookie, and I be hookin your show
10 times the rhyme and your crowd goin petrol
Shootin the gift while others riffin a dream
You can base if you want, but I'm lettin off steam

Shootin the gift, lettin, lettin off

Go 'head and tell it, I smell it, it's creepin right through your veins
Wanna race your next release date doggin my name
You breathed, I hear it, come back and burn you on the spot
Another homicide in case you wanna beef a lot
No challenge is small, don't let me give them my all
You will have ruined your own train, yeah, take a fall
I take it and break it and make you a mystery, gee
Have em wonder what keeps hidden my stage underneath
No freedom, I beat em and eat em just like a lunch
But of course there's a big mouth, I cold just crunch
Cause the poet will flow it and kick it just like this
Try to hit but don't miss, cause I be throwin a fist
You get tough, I get puffed, call your bluff in a sec
Try to step and get stepped on, step back when it's mic check

Fuckin with me, you lose your mind, don't know what to do
Who freaked who?  I fucked and freaked you

["who freaked who" repeats with Apache and Nikki D ad libs to end]
