[Intro: Zack De La Rocha]
Run them jewels fast, run them, run them jewels fast
Run them, run them, r-run them, r-run them, run them
Fuck the slow mo

[Verse 1: Killer Mike (El-P)]
Fashion slave, you protestin' to get in a fuckin' look book
Everything I scribble's like an anarchist's cookbook
(Look good, posin' in the centerfold of Crook Book)
Black on black on black with the ski mask, that is my crook look
How you like my stylin' bruh? ain't nobody smilin' bruh
'Bout to turn this mothafucka up like Riker's Island, bruh
Where my thuggers and my crippers and my blooders and my brothers?
When you niggas gon' unite and kill the police, mothafuckas?
And take over a jail, give them COs hell
The burnin' of the sulfur, goddamn I love the smell
Now get to pillow torchin', where the fuck the warden?
And when you find him, we don't kill him, we just waterboard him
We killin' them for freedom cause they tortured us for boredom
And even if some good ones die, fuck it, the Lord'll sort 'em

[Verse 2: El-P (Killer Mike)]
We out a order, your honor, you're out a order
This whole court is unimportant, you fuckers are walkin' corpses
I'm a clip wig synonym livin' within distortion
I'll bite into a cyanide molar before you whores win
I'm a New Yorkian, I'm fucked from the jump
I wear my Yankee so tilted I actually walk with a hunch
Look at Mikey, I think he likey, we are sinister sons
(And we the type to greet the preacher with a grin and a gun)

[Hook: Zack De La Rocha]
Run them jewels fast, run them, run them jewels fast
Run them, run them, r-run them, r-run them, run them, r-run them
Run them jewels fast, run them, run them jewels fast
Run them, run them, r-run them, r-run them, run them, r-run them

[Verse 3: El-P (Killer Mike)]
A wise man once said, ("We all dead, fuck it")
Just spit it disgustin' youngin' and hold your nuts while you gunnin'
I listened, tatted the sentence on my dick last summer
Now I'll never get that phrase off my brain, it's no wonder
I'm here to buy hearts, I got hundreds, honey
The cheaper the parts, the better buy for the money
I'm trained in vagina whisperin', glistenin', waitin' for the christenin'
I know the neighbors can't help but listen in
A dirty boy who come down on the side of dissonance
I can't even relax without sirens off in the distances
Not shittin' you, little buddy, this fuckin' island's a prison
The only solace I have is the act of conjugal visiting

[Verse 4: Killer Mike (El-P)]
My solitary condition's preventin' conjugal visits
Though mainly missin' my missus, they keepin' me from my children
Conditions create a villain, the villain is given vision
The vision becomes a vow to seek vengeance on all the vicious
Liars and politicians, profiteers of the prisons
The forehead engravers and slavers of men and women
Including members of clergy that rule on you through religion
(He'll strip your kids to the nude and then tell 'em God will forgive 'em)

[Hook: Zack De La Rocha]

[Verse 5: Zack De La Rocha]
It's De La on the cut,lifting six on your snitching crew
I'm miles ahead of you, you can sip my bitches brew
My battle status is burning mansions from Dallas to Malibu
Check my résumé, your residence is residue
Call her a skin job and my honey dip will backflip for you
You playin' God, your eye sockets she gon' rip into
We sick of bleeding now trey spray and victim you
Done dyin', Phillip AK Dick in you
With clips in the bottom, we dipping through Gotham
Yes eclipsed by the shadows, a dark dance to the coffin
I'm a fellow with melanin, suspect of a felony
Rip like Rakim Allah, feds be checkin' my melody
Yes aggressively testin' with bunk stretches and penalties
Dump cases when facing to cop pleas when we seizing the pump
With reason to dump on you global grand dragons
Still piling fast bucks, Afghani toe taggin'
Know they trackin' me cause we bustin' back, see
The only thing that close quicker than our caskets be the factories

[Hook: Zack De La Rocha][Verse 1: Killer Mike]
Bunches and bunches
Punches is thrown until you’re frontless
Oodles and oodles
Bang bullets at suckers' noodles
Last album voodoo
Proved that we was fuckin' brutal
I’m talking crazy, half past the clock is cuckoo
You rappers doodoo
Baby shit, just basic boo boo
I’m Shaka Zulu
Mansa Musa, my money's buku
My beats is bangin’
Fuck what you rappin
Who produced you?
I slapped the snot, take what ya got
And Run The Jewels you

[Verse 2: El-P]
You itsy bitsy
Furry frightened
And fricken' sickly
A little prickly, dick on display for Winter swimming
Look at these kiddies, Mike
I'm a rat-a-tat 'em for living
I deal in dirty work
Do the deed and then dash
Ditch 'em I'd lend a hand but they stuck in a fist and gun position
We run a brand where destruction's the number one commitment
It’s all a joke between mom contractions and coffin fittings
So we disappear in the smoke
Like we're fucking magicians

[Verse 3: Killer Mike & (El-P)]
No hocus pocus, you simple suckers been served a notice
Top of the morning, my fist to your face is fucking Folgers
(We might be giants, standing on little dandy shoulders)
You punks is pussy proverbial pansy panty holders
I Jake the Snake ‘em, DDT ‘em in mausoleums
Macabre massacres killing cunts in my colosseum
(They all actors, giving top in back of a BM
I’d fall back if the casting calls are ending in semen)

[Verse 4: EL-P]
I'm the foulest, no need for any evaluation
I'm a phallus, a Johnson, a jimmy spraying faces
Any cow that is sacred will get defaced
Like any tyrant murderer gets replaced
Face it
The fellows at the top are likely rapists
But you're like, "Mellow out, man, just relax, it's really not that complicated"
Well pardon me, I guess I'm just insane as you explained
Or maybe sanctifying the sadistic is deranged

[Verse 5: Killer Mike]
This Run The Jewels is
Murder, mayhem, melodic music
Psychotics use it to lose it
Junkies simply abuse
That's word to Phillip Seymour Hoff' and I'm kushin'
Coughin'
I probably smell like a pound when they put me in a coffin
The gates of hell are pugnaciously pacin'
Waitin'
I give a fuck if I'm late, tell Satan be patient
But I ain't here for durations, I'm just taking vacations
And tell him fuck him, I never loved him and salutations[Intro]
Darling-d-d-darling
Dar-dar-dar-dar-d-ling
Oh my
Oh my

[Verse 1: El-P]
Fuck the law, they can eat my dick, that's word to Pimp
Hol up
(You are now listening to Run the Jewels 2)
Fuck the law, they can eat my dick,  that's word to Pimp
I don't fuck with or talk, like all these fuckin' imps
Style violent,  give a fuck if you deny it, kids
You can all run naked backwards through a field of dicks
Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit, that's word to B.I.G
I dreamt we owned the world, but I've woken up and it don't exist, Soak it in, I need no assist, you can't slap my wrist, I don't owe you shit
Trust me, I'm a doctor
DOOM, oper-
Rate of my pulse, won't raise a bit

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
Tip-toe on the track like a ballerina
Ski mask, in a Pontiac Catalina
It's obese, female opera singer
You can run the jewels, or lose your fingers
Me and El-P got time to kill, got folks to kill, on overkill
He hangin' out the window, I hold the wheel
One black, one white, we shoot to kill
That fuckboy life about to be repealed
That fuckboy shit about to be repelled fuckboy Jihad, kill infidels
Allah Akbar, boom from Mike and El

[Verse 3: El-P]
Life is hell, death's a bitch and these fubar rulers getting rich
I cop a zip, it opens up, I smoke it up, go home and fuck
C'est la vie girl, when in Rome
I gave the face, please pay with dome
My business card says you're in luck
I do two things, I rap and fuck

[Verse 4: Killer Mike]
I fuck and rap
I tote the strap, I smoke the kush, I beat the puss
I read the books, did the math
Don't need a preacher preachin' on my behalf
No teacher can teach my arrogant ass
I'm blowin' on crippy while readin' inscriptions that's written by Egyptians and sippin' on whiskey
Ay, baby you with me?

[Hook]
Oh my
Don't cry (x4)

[Verse 5: El-P]
[Whip Crack]
We run this spot like a Chinese sweatshop
Don't stop, work it work it till chest pop
Cardiac arrested, I'm so invested I'm self-invented, that no illusion, there's no confusion you see the future, you fear the future
I've seen the truth and I'm so deluded
I been a better bad guy than I been better than bad
Been a bit a bully talk beating in my chest in fact
I'm a half stack from a rack
I been around the block, babe, I know a few facts
Maniac, brainiac, run go tell them that
ATLien, NY felon rap

[Verse 6: Killer Mike]
Handle me wrong I'm snappin'
Show up at your class, what's happenin'?
Schoolyard bully with a fully automatic
Heart full of pain and a head full of havoc
Everybody stepped on the kid and I'm letting them have it
Havoc
Leaving they momma to say "what happened?"
Who gon buy my baby a casket?
Fuck that bitch I'm a bastard

[Verse 7: El-P]
Megablast, I'm mega lit
On Highway 6 and I'm not strapped in
I don't crash, bitch, I just skid
You got the cash, I'll make the trip
I make the trip, you better pay
Done worse for less, don't make my day
I'm not from Earth, from far away
I bust through chests like baby greys

[Verse 8: Killer Mike]
Runnin' the jewels of the game
Whippin' the mix is like chickens of 'caine
Spittin' the sentence again
Parents is livid again
Kids is just fuckin' insane
Pointin' that pistol and fist for the chain
Reppin the symbol like they in a gang
Delivery dope like a dosage of dope or a noseful of coke for a junkie or fiend

[Hook]
Oh my
Don't cry(x2)[Verse 1: El-P]
Oh dear what the fuck have we here?
These motherfuckers all thorn no rose
Egads what a bad dream better not sleep
Take a No-Doz, do some blow
Oh shit what the hell have we done?
It's alive and it's hungry as fuck
Better hide all the snacks and the dough
It is out of my control, you are shit out of luck
I don't wanna be unfair but the pair
We got beat that weak shit you got (true god)
Blew up the spot with that new bop
Crew drops, do up ya squad without nuance
I don't wanna sound unkind but the
Sounds I make are the sounds of the hounds
That are howlin - Under your bed I'm here growling
Same time under the blanket you're cowering

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
Cowering like cowards cowering on
Concrete showers in Rikers Island
Victims, we the wolves that's wilding
We often smile at sights of violence
Acting brave and courageous
Ain't advantageous for health and safety
So when we say run the jewels
Just run' em baby, please don't delay me
And that goes for a guy or lady
The fam god damn we fuckin crazy
I'll pull this pistol
Put it on your poodle or your fuckin baby
She clutched the pearls, said "What in the world!"
And "I won't give up shit!"
I put the pistol on that poodle
And I shot that bitch

[Hook]
Run the jewels...(x2)

[Verse 3: El-P]
And the crowd chants "Get that paper!"
And the mob says "Kill that witch!"
This city get mad to the max
Better wave bye-de bye to the high scrapes kids
Get a tin foil hat for the rain, in
Hot water from the roof to the basement
I'mma smoke 'til the planet erases
Build a white flag out of Zig Zags, wave it

[Verse 4: Killer Mike]
Often I'm smoking coffin
Sip lean on a bean like Boston
My young bitch here fine like
Pam Grier when she made that movie Coffy
But when my wife's in town
Ay Jackie Brown just stay up off me
Cause if they don't somebody get shot
And they gon' buy a coffin

[Verse 5: El-P]
With the pull of a pin a grenade
Get a crowd to they feet and a soul to its options
I'm a fool for the win I been made
To be loud while these other cats drowning in softness
In a urn or the dirt get tossed in
With a grin or a smirk get accosted
I'm a sin on the verse like a kid in a hearse
Or a nun in a cum shot (stop it)

[Verse 6: Killer Mike]
Big beast in a cage with a heart
Full of rage, it seems I can't behave
You could try till you die, oh well
You failed, it seems the world can't be saved
These streets is full with the wolves
That starve for the week so they after the weak
In a land full of lambs I am
And I'll be damned if I don't show my teeth

[Hook][Verse 1: El-P]
Smoke from the loosie drift
Hold it like a crucifix
Blow from the nose I'm a dragon to a gnome
Got a average of bein' excellent the median just dope
Like the ratio of heroin to laxative that's sold
Authorities have spoken, demanded your pure devotion
Get magnetized to the ground while the falcons of murder close in
I chose to go guano, y'all know, kinda bat shit
The bright lights of fuckery stuck in me automatic
I’ll tea bag a piranha tank, heart barely beatin'
A wild one who’ll swim like directly after he's eaten
While holding a toaster oven that's plugged with a fork in it
Cause death by electrocution's like life in New York, isn't it?
Shoulda been a dentist, mom said it
Pain's the way that my craft expresses
Born in a little shop of horrors that I can't even afford to rent in
Where's the exit?
Wanna talk shop I can chop it up with exacto touch
Whats the rush?
Autograph skin flaps, tag em up
I don't brag enough you de facto suck
A lotta you new to the El Producto milieu
Kinda like “fuck is you?”
I'm a little black spot on a sun of lies
But I'm not too high to say I'm the truth
I line the booth to catch blood like a Bateman
Nothing sacred I’ll mace a play pen
Jewel runner bitch make the name stick
Not for sale but I'm takin payments

[Hook: Killer Mike]
Lie, cheat, steal, kill, win, win
(Everybody's doin’ it)
Lie, cheat, steal, kill, win, win
Everybody doin’ it
Lie, cheat, steal, kill, win, win
(Everybody's doin’ it)
Lie, cheat, steal, kill, win

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
I’m fly as a pegasus, that’s no embellishment
I’m here to pain the whole game, where the Excedrin
Good pussy, good marijuana that be my medicine
And I’m a mixture of MJG and the Weathermen
A revolutionary bangin' on my adversaries
And I love Dr. King but violence might be necessary
Cause when you live on MLK and it gets very scary
You might have to pull your AK, send one to the cemetery
We overworked, underpaid, and we underprivileged
They love us, they love us (why?)
Because we feed the village
You really made it or just became a prisoner of privilege?
You willing to share that information that you’ve been given?
Like who really run this?
Like who really run that man that say he run this?
Who who really run that man that say he run this
Run run run run this?
Like who really fund this?
Like who really fund who say he fund this?
Like who in the world gon' tell Donald Sterl who to put on the “you can’t come” list?
Now don’t be silly
Who the fuck gon' bully me if I got a billi?
If I got a billi and the bitch recording me I’m like who cares
What I wouldn’t be is on TV stutterin' ta-ta-talkin' scared
So the question is when Don’s at home with that traitor ass bitch alone
Who’s that voice on the side of the phone that shakes and rattles his bones?
Could it be the man behind the man behind the man behind the throne?
Gone

[Hook]

Everybody doin' it
Everybody doin' it
Everybody doin' it[Verse 1: Killer Mike]
Reminiscin-in' on our time of innocence
When we drank that Hennessy, ate on lamb and venison
Face fucked you in your kitchenette, fucked you like we tusslin'
Do you fuck your husb-al-and? Like, do y'all be tusslin'?
Do you wear the muzzlin'? Do you ask him pretty please?
Do you crawl on hands and knees, like you used to do for me
Oh, you such a dirty girl, the world won't let you be yourself
I won't accept nothing else, I be having none of that
You be takin' all of this, pleasure come from punishment
Your threshold astonishin', I think I'm in love again
Found my perfect drug again, feel better than heroin
You love my alpha arrogance, 2 Live Crew the narrative
And there it is

[Hook: Killer Mike & Gangsta Boo]
I put that dick in her mouth all day
She got that (dick in her mouth all day)
She take that (dick in her mouth all day)
(She said she wanted my, wanted my)
Dick in her mouth all day, day
I give her that (dick in her mouth all day)
She play with that (dick in her mouth all day)
She want that (dick in her mouth all day)
I think I'm in love again (Love again)

[Verse 2: El-P]
Here I am, my love
Just like when we first hooked up
Feeling like I'm animal
Feeling like you're edible
Bendable
I been away
I don't have too much to say
You say say it anyway
I say take your shit off I'm not playing bae
You little freak
What you are is so unique
Smart and full of filth and joy
You been with some little boys
Now you're with a grown-up man
One who'll actually understands
Kid gloves are not on my hands
I will never condescend
Now spread yourself
She smiled a bit
Gripped the outline of my shit
Oh, my god, I love this chick
I must put my tongue in this
Into every space I go
Give me everything you am
She said, "No, you gimme first"
That was like a day ago
8 AM
She still got my

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Gangsta Boo]
That's what you want huh?
Well let me tell you a little story
I had a young player from the hood
Lick my pussy real good
Kept me stuck with lots of wood
Kept my bank account on swoll
Sniffed my pussy like a rose, smokin' on dro
Made a porn tape, that nigga is a pro, you ain't know?
He had a lot of bad bitches in his past
But I was the one who turned that boy into a motherfuckin' man
His tongue is bomb
And he love for me to ride his face
Front to back, grippin' ass
Pay my bills, where I live, fuck me good
Broke ass niggas killing me
I'm about my money, ho
Never been a square bitch
He ain't paying? Hit the fuckin' door
Talking slick, that Memphis shit
I be from that Haven click
Keep it ratchet so sweet
All these boys kiss my feet
I be on that queen shit
You better bless my realness
Stick your tongue up in my ass
You better show me who you fuckin' with
Run The Jewels
Love again, you gon' lose, I'm gon' win
Let's have an orgy
I'mma share your ass with all my friends (Yeah, ho!)

[Hook 2: Gangsta Boo]
He want this clit in his mouth all day
He want this clit in his mouth all day (Yeah, ho!)
I put my clit in his mouth all day
I've got this I've got this fool in love again (Yeah ho!)
I put my clit in his mouth all day
I put my clit in his mouth all day (Yeah, ho!)
He want this clit in his mouth all day
I've got this fool in love again (Love again)[Verse 1: Killer Mike]
It be feelin' like the life that I’m livin' man out of control
Like every day I’m in a fight for my soul
Could it be that my medicine’s the evidence
For pigs to stop and frisk me when they rollin' round on patrol?
And ask “why you’re here?”
I just tell 'em cause it is what it is
I live here and that’s what it is
He chimed “you got a dime?
I said “Man, I’m tryin' to smoke and chill
Please don’t lock me up in front of my kids
And in front of my wife
Man, I ain’t got a gun or a knife
You do this and you ruin my life
And I apologize if it seems like I got out of line, sir
Cause I respect the badge and the gun
And I pray today ain't the day that you drag me away
Right in front of my beautiful son”
And he still put my hands in cuffs, put me in the truck
When my woman screamed, said “shut up”
Witness with the camera phone on
Saw the copper pull a gun and
Put it on my gorgeous queen
As I peered out the window
I could see my other kinfolk
And hear my little boy as he screamed
As he ran toward the copper begged him not to hurt his momma
Cause he had her face down on the ground
And I’d be much too weak to ever speak what I seen
But my life changed with that sound

[Hook: Boots]
Get out, get out, get out, get out
Feeling this, feeling this too early
Get out, get out, get out, get out
Feeling this way, feeling this way
Feeling this, feeling this too early
Feeling this, feeling this early
Early (x4)

[Verse 2: El-P]
It be feelin' like the life that I’m living man, I don’t control
Cause every day I’m in a fight for my soul
All hands below, high seas in a rickety boat
Smoke o’s so the kid might cope
You want cash or hope, no clash, matter fact get both
Go without get turnt to ghosts
You know that's the law, deal done by the shake of claws
It ain't a game if the shit don’t pause
And I find you odd, so convinced in the truth of y’all
That the true truth’s truly gone
And yes there's a they, any time a man say there's not
Then you know that he lost the plot, what can I say?
Truth’s truth when denied or not, like its true crews ride the cock
Fair enough, the way that the beat bump do sound tough
I made it in the dark like Civil War surgery
Woke up in the same air you huff, early
By twelve o’clock the whole Earth felt dirty
Street Lamps stare when you walk watch the birdie
They’ll watch you walk to the store they’re recording
But didn’t record cop when he shot, no warning
Heard it go pop, might have been two blocks
Heard a kid plus pops watched cop make girl bleed
Go to home, go to sleep, up again early

[Hook][Verse 1: Killer Mike]
Bitch we be that shit that's right
Number two boo boo straight caca (yeah)
I smoke ganja with a dreadlocked rasta
Move like Frank you will die like a hassa
Move like Jesus die like a martyr
Hell of a choice when you're riding on the MARTA
Trying to get some hoes in the hot car
How far is we away, man? Not far
The greatness they claim, not all
Are not, we are those juggernauts
Me El, we hail
Like a young Che Guevara and Fidel
Castro, cash flow, car full of females
Bad hoes, we in the DR
Any fuck rapper boy gettin' out of line I pray the preacher beat him to the goddamn ER

I spit them country rap tunes like Hee-Haw
Cocaine flow fishscale no re-rock
Take a snort for yourself shawty, see? "he raw...
(sniff) See he raw!"
That’s you shawty go on snort your nose off
Then put the news in the street Tom Brokaw
Cause of you shawty met a bad stone bitch out of Brooklyn and that Brooklyn bitch straight got broke off
Yeah she called her homegirl from the BX, freaky lil 'Rican brought X and we sexed
Couple months later brought 'em down to Atlanta and let 'em style on the 'bamas that's right yeah we flex
Heard she got a baby daddy and a nigga acting aggy runnin' round talkin' 'bout yeah he plexed
Nigga better pray for a ho like he Tebow though cause right now he stay losin’ like The Jets

[Hook: El-P]
And I walk around like I got a 36" chain
And I walk around like I got a 36" chain

[Verse 2: El-P]
Bitch we be that shit that's right
Light a flare put your thumbs in the air high five
I came for the stash box gimme that
I been waitin' for this all my life
3 AM and I'm still not right
Still awake still away from fading
Crazy
Psilocybin
Why the ride so hazy
Dribble this spit till the street gets wavy
The bliss and pure shit magician
Get to skipping
Not too tall dark and handsome man
But I talk dark for ransoms man
Spend grands of those zombies
Folded origami
Yes I bag the clams
Anyone object to the styles, get a smile and a backwards hand

Peep that, venomous fangs on the face of an angel
Bringing that buckshot back to the table
Been a veteran, earthbound hellion
Try to say grace get a face full of staples
Woke up and the city air smelled like maple
If you come straight from New York you relate
If you come straight from another place stay tuned
Me and Mike got the whole map held safe

[Verse 3: Killer Mike]
Be it NYC or the ATL
From the ceilings of heaven to the gates of hell
We murder death killed every stage we step
Homicide times two better warn yourself, El

[Verse 4: El-P]
Anybody looking for some trouble better self med
We could double dutch in a minefield, hell gets
Just the right temperature, break beat minister
Riverdance cleats on your face for the finisherHunters with their dogs and deer rifles
Thousands of them line the pavement
Like patient pupae waiting to become worms

[Sample: Mr. Lif]
The people are dead, but the money keeps talking keep-keeps-keep-keeps talking
The people are dead, but the money keeps talking, keep
Keeps-keep-keeps talking

[Aesop Rock] + (El-P) + {Mr. Lif}
(Another dark night) Teething I'm marking a beast sheep
Like I walk in front of 39 thieves in a "v"
Smores over warm helvetica brown proper
For the odd God or monster, propped to teleprompter
Wild blue yonder, blue in the face, angel
Blew into the bugles in lieu of the euthanasia
Usually the shooter community chew the corpse
But I see the wolves have already gotten to you and yours
Day of the dead, play the ledge closely
Train a barrel of monkeys to aim at the lowest bogey
Dope the gonzo I've always felt choked socially
Stole the golden fleece with the culture of total nobodies
Earth rised, divided by fighting tribes
All we do is watch 'em waddle back and forth lighting fires
{Money money}
Detonator, wire cutter, pliers
Two cities enter, one is broken up in tiny tiles
And I wonʼt pose arm in the heart of the lionʼs throat
For a photographic token of my primordial growth
You parade around and kill, so damn proud
Like a flatline fetish, had it's feathers fanned out
War taught him symmetry, skipped into it gingerly
Silk worms ping-pong ministry to ministry
Hell's bells every which way the the wind blows
So I bang my head against any wall you can build, go

[Hook: El-P]
Another dark night, another not alright
Another bad ritual, more botched surgery
Better follow the bread crumbs back in fact, urgently
Or waddle through this section where the natives feel "murdery"
Vicinity wander, claim no soul
Never let an anchor drop
Never had a home, never talk to strangers
Never trust a friend
This is the life and the life will not end

Money (Repeat 8x) - - ] Mr. Lif

[Aesop Rock] + (El-P) + {Mr. Lif}
Next time think
39 thieves are quicker than 40 winks...
Raise your drinks
39 thieves are quicker than 40 winks

We're not concerned with the community aloofness
Dude, we're animals, we just go where the most food is
Lower the toast, most formal etiquette is useless
Truth is you're equally expendable if spoon-fed
{Money money}
Money is cool, I'm only human
But they use it as a tool to make the workers feel excluded
Like the shinier the jewel the more exclusive the troop is
Bullets don't take bribes stupid, they shoot shit

(Another dark night)
Calicos tread around the rabbit hole
Weapons to the heavens and arsenic where the carrots grows
Piss warm sugar water wore the summer canteen
Plus burned rubber like "green is the new green"
Rubber neck froze, slows by the multiplex
Rodeo commotion, I'm open to see what culminates
Bougie on the right, left rep rebel force
Both say the feud will prove the parking lot was never yours
Black top pebble wars
Soldiers molded where the jonesʼs every grown-up
Wants decoded came to grow in
No motive, it showed up in gross quotas
Hog barn burner come see if your homes hold us
Eighty-five rattle-trap parked and fancy
You could swear he was stepping out of Comanche, antsy
Let us in the jetty when they jettison the medicine
And paranormal hatchet and cadets to break the levees in
{Money money}
Both know the totem camaraderie
Token of equality, they post it horizontally
Chronicle the loading dock, they crawl to lodge the colony
Half-mast flags, half caps stole the properly
And sleep the sleep of the just ready on the left
Where the witchcraft spun out of a neighboring sect
With the usual undesirables and the big brother cutters
On the day your name became "This Motherfucker?"

[Verse 1]
Still in Brooklyn
Lullabies chime crooked
For the harrowed and the shook-en
Back to dose me
Back to hold the high closely
For the sparrows and the butchers
See the blood moon hunters moon hear the howling
For the habit and the hammered and the cowering
In the magic with the haunted and the doubted
There are ghosts here
There's a presence there's a power
For the tightrope over tank with the piranhas
For the frazzled its a moment its a promise
To be broke down to be lowdown to be honest
Another showdown with the woozy and the conscious
For the aggy with the baggy with the bottle
With a smile with a sip with a swallow
And don't you ever try to say that you're not one of us, my love
We are the touched
We are entrusted with the same tomorrow

[Hook]
(Till I get there)
I'm still living like a four dollar vic. (Jumping off the world)
(Till I get there)
A lot of trouble four a little bit of win. (Jumping off the world)
(Until I get there)
In the gasoline and sulfur in the sin. (Jumping off the world)
(Until I get there)
You cannot throw me in the briar patch, bitch
That is where I live
(Jumping off the world)

This album is dedicated to Camu Tao

[Verse 2]
And this goes out to the...
To the maniacs
And aristocrat grifters
To the zealots
To the monarchs
What up brainiacs?
Compulsively acidic rainiacs
Repulsively predictable painiacs
To the liars
For the devils night fires
Same to you too town cryer
Top O'the morning morbid
Quite a day we're having gorgeous
Salutations unimportant
Hello uninspired
I thought I'd drop on by and wish you all the luck desired
I wish you all the souls your little mouth can tuck inside
You'll always be that special part of me
That loves to dine on grinning void
So flirty touches dizzy lust I must imbibe
And what a team we made
There's nothing we can't justify
But I am the son disgust entrusted with the undefined
And I can no longer contain whats under my disguise
I've always had the cancer for the cure
That's what the fuck am I

[Hook]

PART TWO: "NOTHING BUT ME AND YOU"

I know there's
Something good that I'd die here for
Something great that I'd live here for
Something fly that I'd write for you
Something wrong that I'd bite you for
Something sick that you'd cure me of
Something said to make sure you're loved
Some of us cannot trust no one
Some of us don't deserve no trust
Nothing wrong with not being strong
Nothing says we need to beat what's wrong
Nothing manmade remains made long
That's a debt we can't back out of
Nothing that they can take from you
Nothing that they can do to me
Nothing I wouldn't do for you
Nothing left here but you and me

There's nothing they would do for you, differently
They're not even listening
They don't even glean what we're existing in
There's nothing here but love and you
Groveling, look what they're accomplishing
The systematic gods have all demolished it
But I've never felt so brave
As when I'm looking at your face
They can decimate my body
But my heart will not disgrace
They can torture and interrogate
And shackle to my boot
I will gnaw off my own leg
And hop the fuck right back to you

Something good that I'd die here for
Something great that I'd live here for
Something fly that I'd write for you
Something wrong that I'd bite you for
Something sick that you'd cure me of
Something said to make sure you're loved
Some of us cannot trust no one
There's nothing left here but you and me
Nothing left here but you and me
Nothing left here but you and me
Nothing left here but you and me
Nothing left here but you and me
Nothing left here but you and me[Esoteric sample]
::Nah, nah just a verse::

"We're Famous" was roach motel
And you crawled right the fuck in it
You forgot I'm a goddamn savage
With a record of always winnin'
You don't really think that you're tough
Or that anyone is duckin' you
We played a sold-out show in Boston last week
Where the fuck was you?
The very first jam on the set was "We're Famous"
I gotta say it was a live show
That song is a crowd favorite
I feel great in Boston, relaxed with good energy
You should go there sometime
Make the twenty minute trek from Beverly
You got the gumption to fuck with El-P
When you're writing songs for wrestlers on the WB?
Goddamn, was it that bad or were you just born a whore?
What's the point of selling out if it doesn't help you sell in stores?
Didn't you hear, dawg: wrestling is fake
Just grown men in Speedos simulating gay rape
Is this what you dreamed of your career when you sent me that tape?
Then in a year you would sell less than Aesop Rock on his first day?
::I study from the blueprint::
I think that shit's upside-down
Cause the ceiling of your career should be laying on the ground
::You're as hip hop as Eddie Vedder::
At least I've got a ::Evenflowww::
Man, you could fit your whole fanbase on the bridge of your nose
Nobody cares about your records
No one's scared of your friends
Nobody wants to do business
Nobody wants to invest
Not impressed with your trust fund money
Not in awe of your daddy's Benz
Don't care if you wear Prada (Why?)
Cause Prada is for gay men
Just an excuse to sharpen my blade and remind you who I am
I'm the guy who sold eighty-thou worldwide and a child that sold ten
I'm a man with a happy fanbase
You're the bitch with no niche
The biggest contribution to the music was introducing me to Lif
(Bee-otch! The truth hurts motherfucker)
Face it, nobody feels you in the street
You will never appeal to the mainstream
You're a permanent opening act for the lower half of the indie scene
You are not making an impact, you have very few fans
You are a complete failure, you are not nice with the hands
Your legacy depresses me, mediocrity for years
Your records move off the shelf as quick as Norm off a barstool, Cheers!
Here's an El-P beat for free, I won't tax you
Save that money for the next time you need to hire a black man to rap for you
You're really bringin' it back, man, nobody still says "herb"
I wet your girl's pussy on my keyboard, how you think I made Vital Nerve?
[Sex sounds, three piano key intro of "Vital Nerve" plays]
Check this:
I've had a long, public career
There's a lot of cats that wish I fell
There's a lot you could say about me
Just nothing you could say well
I've been through this before
This type of shit don't make me nervous
I should have known you would be next with a record called "Soul Purpose"
::I-I-I'm down with East Coast::
How the fuck you thought that?
I always thought that you were talentless
Always considered you a fake cat
Always hated the rich kids in school
They never had no true grit
They always thought expensive clothes and a hand-me-down whip made 'em the shit
And you're the definition of something kids should get with?
Cause your man bear-hugged Cage that means that you could swing fists?
What is this, a mother fuckin' joke?!
You got Ted Kennedy's voice and flow like Jay-Z after a stroke
Saw the cover of your album
Good luck to your ska band
Standin' in a Burberry sweatsuit on the corner, looking for SoundScans
Don't you watch B.E.T.? Burberry's for women
How's the son of a millionaire gonna judge what another man's dipped in?
I could step to you in a leotard and still have a tradition
With a trucker hat that says "Eso mommy blew me
And wiped her tits off in the kitchen"
Oh no, you're not a nerd
You're in the clubs singin' the "Thong Song"
Only true thugs rap about Star Wars and Tauntauns
::"I'll treat you like a Tauntaun and slash your flesh"::

::[Spoken interlude]::

You are not dangerous
You have no connections
You will never hurt anyone
You do not carry a weapon
::"I liked 'Funcrush'"::
Great: I never liked what you've done
If I was hypnotized I couldn't remember the name of one of your songs
But I'm a nerd, so I research, motherfucker: be alert
Remember that?
The Transformers sample stuck between the verses?
Well that was the only song you ever had that almost worked
Too bad to get to the chorus we had to hear you rhyme first
Back when you called yourself Seamus the God Awful
That was blindingly accurate: that moniker was immaculate!
And no matter how hard you were tryin'
The only way I could stomach your voice is when Virtuoso was rhymin'
You got one of those UPS four-day ground deliveries
No one wants to sign for that package
You are a faggot
Nothing you have done until mentioning my name has ever mattered
Seven hectic minutes of awkward fury: really, I'm flattered
That Gay-sop Rock thing? Genius
Let me try: Gay-mus
Shit, I shoulda put that on my verse in "We're Famous"
And about that verse? C'mon, don't be offended
I was gonna say your name, dawg, I just couldn't remember it

[Spoken word outro][El-P]
For all intents and purposes I ram pride
Resonate pussy rapper get the long donkey cock
I keep telethon MC's clinging to Jerry's person
Motherfuckin Tourette's syndrome MC's can't freestyle without rehearsing
Crossed T's and dotted I's but still caught a liquid shit surprise
Rappers got on colored contacts but they better real-eyes
Contact CoFlow shit equals El, Bigg Jus distortion
Try to merk off on our pile but you choked on my fuckin portion
You oughta scream, got my name up in your mouth like cock or gingivitis
When every rhyme becomes the official new blueprint for wannabe writers
I don't mind you talkin shit just keep it in the first person
Think realistically if you diss me could you handle my rebuttal version
Then again if you spit my name it only means you recognize my status
I flip the script use your little diss as a promotional apparatus
I'll ignore you sellin crack, killin people, and keepin it real
But disrespect me and my adopted fam and die young like veal
When miscellaneous MC's drop they (their) spontaneous
Bullshit metaphors, the outcome is always obvious
When that piece of shit Mother Time gets cut short in 1999
I'll be stress-free, knowin that while I was on Earth I got mine

Say what..?

8 Steps to Perfection, the sum of each part forms an octagon
Where rhyme styles get sparked..[Verse One: Bigg Jus]
Rugged like Rwanda
Don't wander far or get chopped up
Quick to rush the spot like baby urine get mopped up
Tags that spray your hall with rap aerosol
Organized graffiti lectures in can control
Or level with the devil racing uptown first to Fort Apache
I'm much too much for any demon style to master me
From the Throgs Neck Bridge to the Hell’s Gate
Lyrically detonating
Sparking M-80's and bottle rockets it's a nigga chaser
Downtown graffiti deface a heroin debaser
Open up your eyes and clean out your nature
Wide open like the Grand Canyon
Emcees couldn't hang if they was lynched by the Grand Dragon
Searching for my style like Job-Corps
Coming home on work release shoplifting at the rap store
But sabotaging me ain't easy
I'm crooked like Nathan Wind starring as Cochese
With a big baseball bat you get robbed like DeNiro
A sandwich still ain't nothing but a hero
Just a small sample of the abstract
When the rhyme gets crazy hot and lyrics don't know how to act
Whether shooting joints or wax
I go all out and attack crabs and herbs that's crazy wack
We all can't be pimps, and we all can't rap
You got to get your dollars on cause it's on like that
Here's what I want you to do
Niggas with the green axe and burgundy Forerunner, inhuman like Blade Runner
When I'm rhyming all summer just listen to the drummer
Transistor blister feedback freak the impedance
Funk flow we expose frequencies in sequence
Napalm gets dropped long range like fiber optics
Check the rhyme activity your skills is microscopic
Peace to my crew and my nigga El-P
Who's here to spark it causing all these crabs to flee

[Verse Two: El-P]
Check it and I inflict it quattro nine fifty lungs misty
Call me Maxmillian cause I'm that crazy robot
Teetering on the edge of outer space
Spitting buckshots till black holes surround me, you found me
As far as I'm concerned I've got your ashes in an urn
Big up, the temperamental hold none barred kid
What's your conjunction
Tracks is type dusty
Drinking water out the well of life and I'm a piss it back rusty
Fresh ebonics, you're goddamned right
I'm on em like aorta pacemakers hooked up to clappers
Clap off
Welcome to my free-form jubilee, look at me
The witness to the shit you wanna be
DBA, lyrical P, burners insipid, I’m a sycophant
Feeding on fats passed and dipped
In and out of my invisible state
Forerunner rep tyrannical
Wrecks like tecs bust mechanical
Rusty goner weasel painting beats on an easel
Shoot a head up, what bitch you're boxing shadows
Look out my way you pull your breath out to battle
Breaking your double helix, and now the shit is single
Not mono, I burn the needle out your phono
El-P the third gunner on the grassy knoll
Stroll, keep the seventh seal of heaven in my pocket
You're faggot like Sprockets, motherfuck the Houston Rockets
I'm so sick of recycled metaphors
Bet but I'd fuck Laura Ingalls only when she's done with her chores
Got rappers tip toeing on a Highway to Heaven
Got manners like Bruce Banner when he's stressed
I'm sick of your corny beats and your crowd-involved hooks
Cause I'm a thinker
Evil anus letting off stinkers

[BJ]
Eight steps to perfection
The sum of each part forms an octagon
Let rhyme styles get sparked
[EP]
Eight stpes to perfection
The sum of each part forms an octagon
Where rhyme styles get sparked

[Verse 3: Bigg Jus]
The holy terror, last move you made was an error, you never won't win
Playing taps on a violin
You can never comprehend the rhyme origin
I rate one like a Chinese, Jamaicin like a chin
Hot rocking corduroy, Ballys that's so fitted
Niggas came and assed out my tracks and left 'em shitted
Fuck the movement, lubricate the smooth shit
Just to letcha know, never do I use it
Strictly the blueprint for the ghetto music in my cypher
Shorty the sniper Jeep like Cherokee
When I take aim handling wall to wall emcees
Mr. Madman attract lyrics like magnets
They fuck up speaker cabinets when I'm stabbing it
Like the Juice, then go Bronco busting loose
That's my word, you couldn't shoot or try to compute the math
To kick any type sport like the vandal
I manhandle emcees get murdered like Tenor Saw
Or trapped in the bedroom with the Texas Chainsaw
Massacre, One Two Three, The Taking of Pelham
Eastwick underground New York be the dwelling
I keep telling em the state of the mind be the mentals
If you murder up in the ghetto you murder in a temple[Vast Aire]
My mother said, "You sucked my pussy when you came out
Don't ever talk back
I handed you life and I'll snatch it back"
I'm just a latchkey kid with a snotty nose
High school drop out
Space I'm around need whiteout
And I ain't dealing with no minimum wage
I'd rather construct rhymes on a minimum page
Cynical ways, cats sin for nickels these days
Pulling the chrome out
And you acting like pulling the chrome out
Hated the sound of grandma's crying the crooked letter
You could hear it from the ground or where the sky thunders
Make you wonder about early Sunday morning
Relatives dressed in black and they all mourning
Flows be banging in the paint, throwing elbows
My first fight was me against five boroughs
I lost my first wish
But remembered every detail of my first kiss
That's that Bronx Tale bliss
The holiest of holies
Hip hop, it was '88
Even at the age of 10, phrases levitate
Drinking Little Hug quarter waters
Dodging stray slugs on the corner in that exact order
While you playing, death is what happens
I found the passion in aerosol cans and hands clapping
Back spins, microphones and cats rapping
Linoleum and up rockers, the show shockers
Who rip Lee patches off of impostors
You ain't the real McCoy, you a wind up toy
And it's going to cost you
And that's my B-Boy Alpha

(Someday you'll find me)

[Vordul]
Straight out of the depths of hell
Reflect the sec and
Inhale the buddah wisdom
Envision and edit inscriptions of a Megalah spiritualism
Paint a picture from the spiritual
And seriously spit a lyric
That'll rip through a physical ligament
Trigger living in these city limits
Limited with no money, going through crazy minutes
Crazy thinking of back in the days
When blazing the lazy writtens
Before we was swallowing deuces, popping with gooses
And rocking the bubble gooses
Trouble lose kid, puffin a loosie
Hopping off Huffy, stealing Marvel comics and water uzis
All of us canoeing through sewers with juvenile maneuvers
Caught up in nooses from borders with troubleshooters
On corners where coppers will hop out of Dunkin Donuts
Popping they gun and shoot us
Or more of us aware
Thinking Rudy Giuli really don't give a fuck about a mouli
Got me woozy, sipping Kalhuas losing my noodles
Screwed up in the two triple losers
Spraying it live, b-boy graffiti alpha
Out of rap-palooza[Sample]

O'Brien: How does one man assert power over another?
Winston: By making him suffer
O'Brien: Exactly

[El-P]
Yo, I touch with rusted clutch spun out of the dust
And careen into the temples of automated destruct
Nanotech bugs in the blood get unplugged
Fishing for the fly shit hybrid
I run among the mudskipper swarms through warnings in Good Morning Beirut
Little BillyBlunderbuss looking for more recruits
City life is practice, casket truancy
That's the rule of you and me, brash unmasked lunacy
Friends used to laugh fast, grasped little truth from me
Now they check their bags with a staff claspin' Uzis
Who deserves a wrath without warning?
The same sky for the martyr with a spork
Scorch, New York forfeit
Run among the poppy fields order some more clips
Store trips are weird but the fear is forceless
Bloomey bought the city of Lego and shitty metal hull
Jitters to the floor boards, burned
Almost aborted
Flight of the accidental tourist: morbid
The advertising gods so oddly court shit
Godly corporate squads plot these tortures
Holiness is hard and it's costing god fortunes
(guess he took a second job on the force to afford it)
I don't want a part of these self fulfilled prophecies
Man it's too much for my stubbornness, I hate the people runnin' shit
Now if you sleep at ground o below, wishing you peaceful sleep
Where horror on the surface emerges less frequently
Metal bars of ancient Rome dissolved from the scenery (now what the fuck)
I'll take a hostage and walk through the mosh pit
Pristine untouched, NB703's untouched
Trust is a commodity crushed by Pol Pottery
Your cookie cutter laws contain flaws in philosophy
Toppling down a flight of Escher/Bach steps: delight
Cause the man who raped my sister won't sleep right tonight
Suppose the pretty horses in fours could love more
But I'm exhausted by the scope of this dark god on opiates
Breakfast for dystopia and ruthless hope movements
Seasonal infest of the butchery's lookin good
And now writers block is a prison camp where free press regress
Now we can hypnotize the herd
I'm alive with fly visions that attack like Alfred Hitchcock raising rabid carrier pigeons
True the only form of com not tapped is trapped strong
In the cranium of future rebel infants whistling song
I know you're listening, get down with this bitch, whistle along

[Sample]

O'Brien: ...Power is inflicting pain and humiliation. Otherwise, you can't be certain. Power is tearing human minds apart and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing

[Cage]
It's like the Bilderburgs came to dinner with filthy birds
They pussy all infected I'm lookin for milky words
They pulled my third eye out then they let it dry out
Had to pour my belief in Chrst to find out (I don't believe in)
What I look like with no skin
The movement faded while the back of my paper is stilluminated
Even your no flipped egyptian Euro
Got my website shut down by the Bureau
Can't kick it with the dead until my life stop
But Bush got a ouija to talk to Adam Weishaupt
I breath martyrs, turn fans to artists
Put a couple G's together before harvest light
I'll take all this
The hell I'm doin?
Dippin this whole fuckin' pound in enbalmin fluids
You think I rhyme to do it?
If it's on point try is
If you can't help but sleep peel off your eyelids

[Sample]

If you want a vision of the future...imagine a boot stamping on a human face

[CamuTao]
It's the year 2010, you can say what you want
But I bet if you light this blunt, dummy, the feds'll come runnin'
Lock you up, lock you out, you ain't tryin' to listen
Cameras in your food, dude, look they're trying to listen
Lock you up, lock you out, we got bugs in the house
We're being monitored, they know we got thugs in the house
Don't light your blunt, bitch, they'll hit you with a switch
Hit you with a beam, hit you in the brain, make you go totally insane
Wild out, guns in the spot, flippin' on you niggas
They take you out, then the Feds push guns on the roof
They take 'em out, snuffed you out cause you know too much
After that you know your ho's get touched
Look, then the meeting starts
Download your chick to a memory card
Give her chips and send her to a city job

[Sample]

Power is not a means, it's an end. In our world, there will only be triumph and self-effacement. Everything else we shall destroy[Verse 1: El-P]
That was me in BK on Atlantic
Never looked both ways, ran in traffic
Pops went away but I stayed, vagrant
Placed where the steel and cement became nature
Love what you did with the place, it looks gorgeous
Cityscape where the blood of good men courses
And the dreamers are bull trapped in porcelain
Take a knee to the gods and get horse shit
Wanna live for the thrill? They'll arrange it
Got a bevy of imps to spit hatred
Shit'll get in your head and cause panic
Have you desperately begging to get famous
Get your dignity dirty and left orphaned
Sanity on the fringe of distorted
Who are they to just take shit and hoard it?
Who am I that I don't get my portion?
The most impressionable minds get molested and informed by manipulating forces
Don't fret little man, don't cry, they can never take the energy inside you were born with
Knowing that, understand you could never be poor
You already won the war, you were born rich
You can only take the energy you had
Going back to the realm or the home where your lord is
Whoever whatever that lord is couldn't
Give a fuck if you ever made fortunes
Fuck anyone ever trying to run that bum shit
Send 'em to the flames where the orcs live
Them and the lost minds thinking they're smarter than us
Don't understand love's importance
And we can weaponize that, bring 'em back to the truth
Where the ashes and dust got formed in

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
The beat breaks and your teeth break
Keep your canines embedded in my knuckles as a keepsake
It would seem your veneers just mere souvenirs falling out your mouth and on to the landscape
Me and El-P do the secret handshake
Then I pummel punch a pumpkin head punk in his pimple face
'Till he's punch drunk cause he's sweet as a pound cake
(Ain't he pussy, Mike?) Yeah, El, I'll say
Into the wild, wildstyle ghetto child running wild
Where the lions and the owls stay
The powers that be even offered up reprieves
Told us they ain't take us out if we bow to our knees
But they can give that to the kings and the queens
And the worshipers of idols and followers of things
Cause I would rather be in the jungle with the savages
It's kill or be killed, and I'm working with the averages
My professor emeritus
Say we been cursed being brought to the Americas
How you raise a whole human single parent, no marriages no sense of heritage
Planned Parenthood helping plan miscarriages
But I'm lucky mommy already had a narrative
Product of a teenage love, my arrogance
Derives from the pride in the job my parents did
Named Mike, I was told it was godlike
Even danced with the devil, came out alright
OK, honor y'all? No way
Still spell Amerikkka with the triple K
Word up to Spice 1 and O'Shea
And any MC peeping what I go through
Real rap, my last line's so true
Rest in peace to Pimp C and Camu, too
We do it for you[Mr.Lif in the background]
(How the hell did it get to this
That this is what I gotta do?)
Mic Check!

[Verse 1]
Well if you can't beat em', join em', Build em', Employ em'
This kid got gold teeth, fuck it, coin em' so we can get some loot inside our pockets
My man who just did a bid said, "you haven't tried it, don't knock it"
I wear the rings of Saturn on my knuckles like truck jewels
For 40 acres and a mule I'm down to buck fools, my tool illest thoughts
Could make the world a realm of lost souls, keep my mind in two polls
Keep the world on two poles in my head juxtaposed
I cite and murder flows, on the low I conjure flows the way that it's supposed to be
I keep tint rings around the rosary
I'm bout to rob this store I need some loot and some groceries
I need a loaf and free butter, fuck another night of hunger
I've been a good man and I don't deserve to suffer
After this night, I'll return to being peaceful, put that on my people
Word to Big Shank and Lil' Pete though, yo

Do you recall the days when brothers used to chill
Flex on the mic and display ghetto appeal
Yo those were the days when it was really real
Yo those were the days when it was really real
But we'll...all get it back together one day
But until then its snuff gunspray
Jah bless my head with every night I lay, and I pray for a brighter day

But anyways gotta get them thoughts out of my mind now
Wipe the sweat off my eyebrows, nostalgic thoughts bring my hideout
"Lie down, you two niggas in the second aisle."
First brother shook with fear, while the second nigga caught a smile, "While
You doing that why don't you strip like Gaza"
This nigga yells out, "well you's a frontin'-ass rasta!"

"By my actions, I'd have to say that that's true;
But shut the fuck up. I didn't ask you
I might blast you, If I have to, yo masked dude
They won't find me, even if you ID
But yo thanks for checking me." Then unexpectedly
This head nigga right behind the counter started wreckin' me
9 millimeter weaponry, all your beans leaking on the chest to me
Nobody understands society molested me, they just questioned me
Nature of the ongoing clean up crew clean my blood stops flowin
All my enemies out on the block gloating, plus the government is smiling
Cause they sense the scent of death blowing, just showing
They plans runnin' precisely, "this nigga ought to fit into a wood box nicely"
Ghetto stress, have my own fuckin people ice me
If you look you can find me, on the corner store tile floor
Another landmark of the ghetto I saw
Is it all worth to die for? Noooooo

Its not worth it ([echoes]nooooooooo)

[Three Men talking]
Man 1: Yo oh shit, money. This dude just got shot, son!
Man 2: He got shot?
Man 1: Yeah fucking shot, dawg, tryna rob a store
Man 3: What? Who the fuck is this!?
Man 1: Thats fucked up yo
Man 2: We gotta get out of here
Man 1: Yo this ain't cool, I'm out
Man 3: Yo where you goin?
Man 2: We gotta get the fuck out of here, this nigga wildin, HE WILDIN', IM
OUT!.......
Man 3: Yo I think I went to high school with this kid!

[Sample]
I'mma live life after this one time...[Verse 1: Killer Mike]
This year we iller than a nun in a cumshot
Gettin’ double penetrated in a dope spot
By two hard pipe hittin’ niggas
On the orders of Marcellus to the soundtrack of 2pac
I’ll beat you to a pulp no fiction
Tarantino flow new Jules and Vincent
Blow marijuana smoke no incense
Exhale in the face of innocent infants
On some "Ah hah look what I did" shit
And if I get stopped by a crooked ass cop I'm a put a bullet in a pig
And Rin Tin Tin, ah hah hah look what I did again
We the hooligans outside of school again
Sayin don’t be a fool never follow rules again
We the bad boys bully with the fully that
The teachers say ain’t shit and in the need of discipline
We the goddamn reason for ritalin
In the back of the class, twitchin’ and fidgetin’
Dead wrong we never got along
We laughed at the kids that was active participants
Bad boy walk right past church with the work in a bag
And a bible of Gideon
Got suspended for bullyin' a bully
When I go back to class I'ma punch him in his shit again
Punch him in his shit again
Punch him in his shit again
Punch him in his shit again
Punch him in his shit again

[Hook]
Cause you get no respect

[Verse 2: El-P]
I don't flirt with greatness I wifed it in Vegas
The shits all paid for I signed the papers
Used to date but then I made her my main bitch
Bought us a place on a lake with some acreage
And Mike's my neighbor straight from Greatville
Any invader get slayed and stay killed
On sovereign land, Mike fill the safe up
We call when the fam get paid a great thrill
I Bad News Bear hug beats then creep off
You drive a rape van
Mullet Ray-Bans
We do Vicious
You do witness
You don't clap shit you's a cricket
Run the J’s we don't run so much it’s all fun and games till my J’s get scuffed
I'm livid, fuming, out of touch
I wear sweatpants to funerals, guns to lunch
Close the blinds they got drones and mines we so close to the lie I can almost die
I got no goals left but to save my mind
They got more holes dug In the earth, oh my
The beat get abused like I rock a wife beater
Drinker, fired by the company
Friday, late on the car note tryna do taxes
This my house it's high or the highway
High or the highway
High or the highway
High or the highway
High or the highway

[Hook]

[Verse 3: El-P]
I'm a thrill killer, I will test you
Just like daddy fuckin' left you
It’s all your fault, mommy's lonely
You’re a burden, she needs rescue

[Verse 4: Killer Mike]
Hey little buddy, where’s your mommy?
Call me stepdad or Uncle Johnny
Here’s a dollar don’t follow behind me
I gotta go bang out mom and auntie

[Verse 5: El-P]
I hunt lions, tigers, rare vaginas
Hang where the cops seem scared to find us
Pop stars peep the bars and rewind us
Fuck your life but first run the diamonds
From the jungle (the jungle) the brothers (the brothers)
Can't relate to your first world struggles
You want safety, hugs and cuddles
IED’s will leave bloody puddles

[Verse 6: Killer Mike]
Woke up in Nigeria
Kicked out America
Case of malaria
Shit got scarier
Got left with a gun and a pitbull terrier
And a note from my dad said I hope God carry ya
Fought one or two wars while I made It to the shores
Y’know back to the home of a rock in Georgia
To return as a king, Michael the benevolent
Gold draped ridin' on the neck of an elephant

[Hook][Intro: Killer Mike]
(Paul is dead)
One time for the pill and the reefer, man
One time for...One time for...
One time for the pill and the reefer, man
One time for the...One, one-one-one

[Verse 1: Killer Mike]
One time for the pill and the reefer man
It's the young black leader to the people, man
If you’re girl’s fine, nigga might eat her, man
I'm talkin' middle of the mall like a pita, man
A Nigga sky high now like Jesus, man
And oh Lord this reefer so potent
Got an anti gravity, a Nigga stay floatin'
This nigga rob me, bitch you must be jokin'
Like pow pow pow leave your chestplate open
One half the best tag team ever
Them other fellas all right we better
Anybody disagree they jealous
And anybody don’t just motherfucking yellow (just yellow)
Fuck a boss I’m the goddamn owner
And I smell like YSL and marijuana
Don Draper with the paper might pull a slick caper
Secretary told me "fuck you," I told her you gonna

[Hook]
And I been this way, shorty
(All my life)
And I been this way, bitch
(All my life)
And I been this way, shorty
(All my life)
And I been this way, bitch

[Verse 2: EL-P]
Sharp like knife
Bet a buck I’m stuck in the guts of the night
And I’m (ready on the right)
Please pass that already, alright
Get fetti, he’s steady on the mic
What the fuck else can he do right?
Step armed heavy and he brought Mike
Never step light, no fair fights
We got the drugs y'all wanted
Take a suck on the tail of a comet
I’m so high you a hobbit
Dick level, please back up off it
Better off dead like Paul is
Your name don't Ring, go Starrless
Me and Mike we a friend to the farmers
The weed run out, we might cop your whole harvest

[Hook]

Go! (x32)[Verse 1]
Born in love with a bloodline punch
And a time release that the capsule held so strange
Wore a target of a frontline punch
And a crime exceeding of absolute rage
Rode a train in a blood clot vein
Where the names of the young were hung in our face
Saw the wrong and withstand the tug
Of my fees the reason, a big mistake
Bore a likeness of those before him
Who held the title in flesh and name
Said hello and then said goodbye
And in between he would plead his case
Saw the dark and embraced the light
And he felt the crawl of his calling fate
Stuck the landing but tripped the wire
And let every weapon off in his face
Saw the looting and convoluting
Of absolution that never came
Tried polluting with contribution
And held the movement in every frame
More of the withering, unforgiving
And run to the last grand contraband
Caught the harm and then bought the farm
And that's the part where I come in

[Hook]
But all the cash and all the cash
And all the cash and all the cash
In the world can't pay me to
Let go of you (go of you)
And all the death and all the death
And all the death and all the death
They dealt don't change the way
I fell for you (fell for you)
(x2)

Try to take it, oh you can't
Pry it out my cold dead hand
Pry it out my cold dead hand
(x2)

[Verse 2]
Born in love with a bloodline punch
And a time release that the capsule held so cold
Wore a shrug of a one-time fuck
In a clear mistake, well that's great, lets go
Rode a train in a blood clot vein
Where the eyes of men caress head, chest, toe
Saw the rug and withstand the tug
Of our absent love, well who the fuck knows
Bore a likeness of those before
Who held the title in flesh not name
Said hello and then said goodbye
And in between she would sit and wait
Saw the light but embraced the dark
As she heard the call of her crawling hate
"Fuck the landing, I'll man the weapons
And hold the barrel to my own fate"
Saw the promise and felt the presence
Of possibility, just not her's
Tried connecting with lost affection
And saw direction with lust not words
More of the withering, unforgiving
And bad to the last drop, Brooklyn birds
Fill the weapon and spin the chamber
And bend the part and are not hurt

[Hook][Twinn Zeus 2012]

I’m tired of killing for people that would never die for me
Bleeding away slowly in this stall tell her goodbye for me
My story, is irrelevant and out shone by the next man’s gory, allegory
So I’ll wait for the locust and the plague
While I’m heckling the devil, initiating trade
Starting with the monkey’s on my back and the dark circles under my shades
Or the worth of my soul and the puddle that I have made
These hands that have held hearts rip them apart and thrown them away
I wish I could blame it on a fit of rage
But my actions feel normal and the excitement always fades
Down drains with the sins I thought I rid myself of in my glory days
They have to pool up somewhere
Who knew it would be in my heart but I don’t think that’s fair
I must eviscerate this circuitry instead I repair
A thousand broken mirrors reflect cold stares
Your heart is so important I bet you’d kill for it
In order to fill your belly you need to fill more clips
We've produced more shells than there are in the sea
But you can’t shoot bullets at the shell of a man you’ll grow to see
He’s pushing a baby carriage roaming free
Dogs bare fangs; fake smiles show teeth

Listening to the echoes of your voice travel down the barrel of a gun
Keep balm for lips
Ready to detonate and spit
Lyrics so swift that they take any hit and still run

I am a controller
Cordless next to my mahogany degree holder
Hand folder, toy soldier
A holographic representation of the border
A battery free solar charger
Collegiate wasted language destructive trench mortar
Cherish anguish with the mentality of a hoarder
The devil pays me royalties for every crashed charter
I’d spit harder if I had a straight smiled Ali Larter
That I could use to barter
For a better set of circumstances, make an expert out of a starter
Novice anti thesis of sean carter
N man’s man a martyr’s martyr
Wind extinguishes candles and fans flames
Looking for a beggar to blame
For the conscious efforts made to remain under the line and play the governments game
Worried about getting paid, when you can’t take it to the grave
But you’ll trust it to the bank, over the hand of a stranger
Those greedy palms must be safer
And protect you from the danger
That these haters form
But I must be stating the obvious because it seems like the norm
Wouldn't walk a mile in your shoes because they’re worn
From running this corrupt system from which I was born
It’s everywhere this stench won’t leave
Clouds my visions claws at my throat I can’t breathe
Born to die but we die to be born to reach nirvana, right
Eternal happiness can only be found in the afterlife
Until death binds me forever to this sense of right
And the last pocket of air escapes my lungs and takes flight
Shooting towards the exosphere in the middle of the night
Reaches a proper height and warns the angels of my plight
He’s coming… quick everyone hide
So we can catch him off guard and attack while he’s surprised
Aim for his groin, his heart, his eyes
But don’t quit attacking he is proficient with knives
And has the ability to create any weapon with his lines
Tap out Morse code young Gregory Hines
While you’re catching more z’s than bee’s rhymes
I’m connecting golden hexagons like a bee hive
Press rewind
Attach claymores to the weak points that I find
Accumulating artillery until the spirit of Atilla the Hun
Carrying two golden guns fills me
Octo-mic crusher call me killer bee
Stump the Riddler literally
Hack saw jaw with two griddles for grilled cheese sizzling
On my grind like two women scissoring
Burn open wounds with industrial grade Listerine
Channel chakra in my hands until my fingers start blistering
Perforated your body with holes
So when the wind blows
I can here you whistling[Verse 1: El-P]
A little toast to the no ones
With a nod to the masters
To the ones with the riches
From the ones who the rags fit
A little smoke for the gone boys
A little nod to the spirits
We're still here runnin' round screaming
They're still here pointing and laughin'
Don't walk away when I talk
I'm tellin' you
Turn around mister
I got a permanent bop
Who the hell do I think I am not
And I'm twice as hot
As about half of hell
I get lighthouse lit up
Get down diduck
The boy got a barracuda bite
You can tell

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
Got hope for the living
Got prayers for the dead
In the sky got whiskey and rye for the voices in my head
Got kush for the pain
Cause the world is dangerous
Driven great men insane
Anchor themselves with angel dust
Somewhere between love and lust
A nut get bust
And a baby get made
It seems that trouble trouble us and follow us
Like all our days
In every holy book it says we suffer that's what it is
So riddle me this from the womb to the tomb why do
We fight to live

[Hook 1: EL-P]
(RTJ)
A little toast to the no ones

[Verse 3: El-P]
You say you wanna be my leader
I think you wanna be my God
You say you on the side of the righteous
I say I'm gonna hang with the wrong
There's truth where the filth is
There's lies in the law
You want a whore with a white dress
I want a wife in a thong
You love fear and division
I ain't fuck with your symbolism
I don't give a fuck about power
I'll pluck an eye out a pyramid
Cut a ear from a mouse hat
Go Van Gogh on a house rat
Find another mind to devour
Motherfucker I'm really not hearin' it

[Verse 4: Killer Mike]
A pope is a fraud
A church is a lie
A queen is the same damn thing
You should pray to your fake god that she die
God really exists I tell you like this it reside inside
And anybody tell you different, just selling you religion, tryin' to keep your ass in line
I kill my masters
I mentor none
That means when I die that's it
My style is gone I'm a one of one
One half of the great RTJ
Defeated the odds went to war with the gods
Earned all our scars and came back straight

[Hook 1: EL-P]
[Hook 2: Killer Mike]

Angel Dust
Angel Dust

[Piano outro]I gotta get out of here, this city’s gonna kill me
Could be anywhere, anywhere but here
I wonder how long before this shit gone take me under

[Verse 1]
Moving through New York City in a black seven fifty
Like Batman moving through Gotham
Dodging pot holes as I gently move through Harlem with my wheels on slalom
Pain in my eyes as I'm passing the place
Where they found Sean Bell and they shot him (Queens)
Forty one times, he committed no crime
But I guess life ain't Times Square
But in the city that’s gritty where the bottom lives shitty
And the mayor’s a billionaire
You learn Manhattan keep on making it
And Brooklyn, keep on taking it
Cause life just ain't that fair
For the kids in the park, watching out for the Narcs
Blowing Sour Diesel in the air
Tryin' to flip them a pack, stack up a couple racks
And make it the hell outta here… (New York)

[Hook]
Let the city peel away right from under you
There are too many ghosts in this town
I can hear them calling out to me, out to me, out to me
I can hear them calling out

[Bridge]
Let the city peel away
There were too many ghosts in this town
I can hear them calling out to me, out to me!

[Verse 2]
I maneuver through the ATL in a black SL
With the goddess of a black female
This is black male Heaven with the ballers are professing
But to me home feels like Hell
Even though it’s black top from the mayor to the cops
Black blood still gets spilled
They raided a house, no drugs were ever found
But a black grandmother laid killed
Like the dream of the King when the sniper took his life
On the balcony of Lorraine Motel
From now forthward, these young black boys
Seem to self-sabatoge they selves
Or maybe they're just smart, and they choose to go hard
Cause they know the good guy will fail
So you ask what happens to a dream deferred
Langston, well it kills itself... (Atlanta)

[Hook]
Let the city peel away right from under you
There are too many clouds in the sky
I can hear them calling out to me
I can hear them calling out
Anywhere but hereHere's a vision
Imagine a whole globe made with precision
Continents of brown soil with green grass
That compliments deep seas and trees with multi-colored leaves
Mountain ranges that survive through the ages
Plus show expressions of time on rock faces
Now gaze up towards the glorious sky
Only appreciated by a powerful eye
As I understand, man is to cherish the land
As we coexist hand in hand
But as time has past
Man has created a vast
Mass of trash that has the capability to smash
Your natural desire to explore your state of being and
Discover you fire
For instance when a child is born
It posseses no intelligence of hate or scorn
But as it learns of hard ways
It becomes tuned from its original nature
As we destroy nature in the name of cash
All justified by laws made by the legislature
You never say *rekcufrehtom* cause that claim they aims to
Seek justice but ain't it a shame
That that isn't the case yo we all are so tame
That we're all fair game
Thats why they got our name
Address social security number
Even though where you bought your last rest
Or mattress have you saying
"Oh that's just the way things are"
Then I explain that you're so far from your core
You need to explore
I wake up in the morning in war and saw
And go look for more
Weapons being prepared for nuclear war
And then when I found some no this is to god, hit
The ground son
With strong winds to make the clouds run
Step up in the laboratory
Keep it mandatory
Their response: Inflammatory
Now their dome's all puffed up
Cause they *kcuffed* up
Give me the data chips
I'll reverse gravity
So mad they'll flip
Show these *kcuffer's* the light
The adequate side of the scene, natty dips
Mankind should feel the effects
As he rips through the environment
Mash up the Earth's power as if
It were required
The whole things blowin a cold heart
Stand as he asks where the fire went
Trapped in an Ice age and while you're defrostin'
I kick open the door and let some Holocaust in
Then I remain sober in the galaxy
Take the form of the sun
So I can shine emphatically
Then I shed light on the tragedy
Step aside just to make way for remorse and apathy
Then I perform something you can all see
As I change the climate from cold to balmy
As temperatures rise
I squeeze acid water out of the skies
To burn out your eyes
Cause you could never see what I devise
And get your five lives and nine tries
But usually nobody survives cause I
Elevated far above and beyond
So you could be bombed, crushed to dust
You can be harmed
You can be armed with shanks and tanks
Bayonettes, Missile Threats
Yet I still launch lyrical text
That gets so intense
It could disassemble all of those other meds
So you should fear what the god invents
Since I was sent under the name of Lif
Which means to upLif
It's my never ending duty to attempt to shift your mind
From one train of thought to a more positive state
So then in turn you can create
Control your own fate
Rather than having those with wealth dominate and complicate
Living to the point where we're all imprisoned
People we should all pick our minds Its's Time!
Look at how the world is designed
It's major
We should all walk out of our manger
And start to educate the nearest stranger
Ignorance has no remainder
I manifest, prophesize visions of danger
With seven lines I show you seven signs
Time's of the essence
Choose before you lose your physical presence
Perpetuate wickedness or walk along the path of god
The force from which we were all created
Stand amongst prosperity
Or fall devestated
Another victim of hatred
In a land where nothing is sacred
Except for these thoughts that I share
With no fear - to make you all aware of the nightmare
I see you puttin in a little work but we're not quite there
Climb out of your darkness, the light is quite clear
We're still to concerned with jewels and hype gear
But I'mma drop my thoughts until you open your eyes...Arise
It doesn't matter what your color creed race or size...Arise(Atoms fam)

[Vast Aire]
Yo, I ain't superstitious but these niggas is nice

[Alaska]
A lot of cats pop shit, I pop apocalypse
Topple propaganda force fed to the populace
My thoughts run the gamut from outstanding to preposterous
On top of this I move posteriors
From impoverished to posh areas
My process: accomplish through perseverance
Every man's not my brother regardless of appearance
Apprehension clouds the spirit
Tension prepares us for ascension
Man at his best is when he breaks chains or conventions
A convenient covenant coveted for conception
We're all from the same mold: spores and bacteria
Told we're inferior, others ignore hysteria
A claustrophobic neurosis
In this masquerade ball of fake glasses and big noses
Alaska splashes explosive flows
To expose Pinnochio's growing nose
Composed of compost compositions
Those clothes are getting a little close fitting
I'll stomp this shit, add a over confident
Script's compliments of my frozen mic dominance
A passively aggressive testament that's how I'm repping shit

[Vast Aire]
Watch Vast murder the track effortless
Like God's on my side and he answered my Christmas list
After the first couple of bars I start to smell fear
That's when I take them there so they can breathe air
You're so secure with your insecurity
Perfect world of piety I swat flies when they bother me
Some say I touch hearts like Kano
Now every time you see a mic you just say no
Some write with words, I write with metal
That's my soul is rust free, raps stay dusty
In the coldest winters we thought husky
They be like, "I don't know his name but he aim like Wayne Gretzky"
That's funny, cause I don't play hockey
I play horse on the mic and watch them all copy
Left hooks left them shook like etch-a-sketch
Give me an inch with mine
I'll take a mile if you let me
I'm not a bum, I'm a nomad, off dome
Thoughts have no home, the page is ours to roam
Cats be on some fantasy shit like Cinderella
Well we'll see if the shoe fits after the accapella
Never made sense claiming something you wasn't
What's the penalty for that? He might never come back
And the atomic pressure won't lessen
After you've learned your lesson
? a track? Yeah that's a buck fifty
Like a farmhand cutting a little piggie
If I'm the author I'm also the farmer stupid
I shoot a arrow at you and my name ain't Cupid

[Cryptic One]
Yo I'm honest with this art
With a William Wallace heart and it's brave
And a blade that's well polished and sharp
Intent ain't to reinvent the spinning wheels of time
Just to enjoy the bumpy rides and improve upon its design
I take time, every plate circle's complete, love it
I've learned even tardy birds come to eat from it
Early bird gets the worm but the early worm finds a spot
In early bird's stomach and can't escape from it
Idiot box jocks are live stock
Graze amongst our mind crops
Beast of burden, murdered, their mind squashed
Primate nations leave these regions unexplored
Liberty torch protrudes through sandy floors on beach shores
Tour the atomic wastelands, desolate
Definite situations of complex Oedipus
Mother nature broken, fucked by offspring's reckless negligence
Destructive corrupted residence of earthly bound pessimists
Found willingly bound in the back of yellow cabs confessing it clearly
Fear the anti-Mobius Strip theories
Dennis Leary, Miller, and Menace cynicism visions
With a depressed Beth Gibbons position on life's mission

[Vordul Megalah]
Now listen, how sick is these niggas?
Atoms the illest, cap peelers
And don't tote guns, smoke onions
Crying with no funds no fun trying
To get by but we still do it and rep music
'Til death do us wet your noodle
With raps in the pot hard boil the rap gargoyles
Stoned at night on top of buildings Gothic
Like Bruce in the blue suit let's get it popping
Watch it drop out of the sky in the rotten
Apple, where some get tackled
Hooks that grapple right on your Adam
Got you choking off the rhyme potents
Stay focused while you villains stay joking
We serious on the mic get ignorant
Delivering rap vocals for the new millennium
We're from Harlem marching in atomic garments
Bombing all the nonsense
Yo, you cats ain't ready for this, heavy abyss
Thoughts that travel through the tunnels of crypts
My mic holds one in the clip and fours packed under the dick
Spit rhino acapells gun in your shit
Get rap plug's stuck in your whips fucking with this
Over these El-Pro percussion hits
We love to rip, love to sip, love to rep Jux to Def
Yeah, Atoms[Intro Samples]
(Since you're my special friend, come closer for a special treat

I'm going to let you touch me in a special place
But I don't want to touch you there

It is never ok to touch someone else's private parts
Your mom and dad will tell you so)

[Verse One: Bigg Jus]
Yo' eyes get, blind like 2Pac gettin shot in the lobby
Most MC's styles is robbery of my freestyles as a hobby
I pick apart monkey brains and spread disease through hot zones
My cameos on promos seem strange like someone's not home
Bigg Jus the outsider rain on your dream field
With styles so freaking wet niggas need maxi panty shields
Expose more moles out the closet than lead paint on your tenement
Got more Black Thought to my Roots than most niggas got in their pigment
It's the baby-faced lieutenant with the Luck like Luciano
Hardcore like Kool G Rap music made for concert piano
So dust off the candelabra, hip hop's version of the super Don Dada
With the license to give more ass whippings than Father
You couldn't see me with binoculars, way ahead of myself like telepathy
Make most crews disappear like blackheads on Oxy creme
Under the lights I fuck up mics with my uncanny ability to heat seek
Through brain facilities with the science of microchemistry
This history of my hip hop is too deep to be dissected
(Bitch!) if you can’t recollect don’t even half step or try to test it (black)
Bigg Jus, I drop so much shit my anus needs an ice pack
In fact I'm all that, El-P yo bring the horns back

(Yes)
Right through the center of your focus picture a long silver needle
(You are correct sir)
Piercing the outer lens of your eyesight

[El-P]
And once again
In one verse we have proven
That we can rip all these signed big budget motherfuckers
(89.9)
Peace to Stretch and Bobbito
(Bob-bi-to!)

[Verse Two: El-P]
Ye olde lyrics of fire
Surface bombs from X-wing fighters, stance to B-boy actors fracture
Negative thirty below wind chill factor
The counteraction is just a helpless action of the hapless flinching
My supersonics leave you mute like Maggie Simpson
Taxidermist El-P I defy translation
Instigate and settin quakes throughout your whole situation
Practice exposing perfection like Ricki Lake exposes white trash
My shit is strange X-file number 2-6-7 whiplash
Triple felon emcee minus the melanin
When I bomb it's the type of shit to make Baby Jessica jump in the well again
Sunshines on rain acid, El-P the battle master
Lactose breaking down your fucking fractals till you're flaccid
I'm leaving Las Vegas like a hundred flying Elvises
Raid, spot my prey, swoop down and cross their pelvises
Rat nerve like David grill smoke bitch
Catch my frozen frame suspended
You couldn't even fuck with my idle fidget
By birthright I'm pulling swords from stones high tone beam
Phonetically abort it try to distort it and catch a silent scream, fetus
The raw daddy tactics prove Krush Groove unstoppable
Testing luck it's like sucking on lead paint popsicles
The enigma, no one can fuck with me but I'm not signed
(You wanna battle?)
It's better to look in the
(mirror)
Say Candyman five times

Candyman (whispered 5x)

Just a promo
Understand
(Candyman)
To be the man you gots to beat the man
(It's so clear now)
Me and Bigg Jus
(The beautiful light)
Company Flow clan
(I can touch it)
Mr. Len, 'sup?
89.9
Hit me with that shit some time

Bigg Jus, Lune TNS
The almighty El-P
The imperial DJ Mr. Len
Company Flow swinging it to you live for '95[Verse 1: Killer Mike]
I move with the elegance of an African elephant
I presented the evidence eloquent as the president
Evident is the emphasis, I deserve me a championship
But before I banana clip I'mma chill so my man can rip

[Verse 2: El-P]
Little man against Hellion with the heart of an orphan
I got the words of a murderer and an eye for distortion
You take a slice of my portion, I'll take a piece of your profit
I drive at illegal speeds, Keep an O.Z in my pocket

[Verse 3: Killer Mike]
We run the jewels in your town, a quarter pound on my person
I'm known for pounding the stage, I'm talking burning and cursing
Producer gave me a beat, said it's the beat of the year
I said "El-P didn't do it so get the fuck outta here!"

[Verse 4: El-P]
You wanna hang, bring your throat, I got stools and a rope
I'mma slang pope, haranguing the land with a man's flow
A new edition to the art of the old code
That's fully retarded and put a part in your bold dome

[Verse 5: Killer Mike]
Ay El
We the villains, we antagonist bad guys
Mercy me, merciless me putting pain in they sad eyes
It's time for Skywalker talk cause meet the true Darth Vader
I hit your mom in '03, but a G ain't ate her
So baby boy, you should tighten up and show some respect
Before I Melvin on you Jody, put my arm on your neck
Or worse yet be the reason your girl want a divorce
Be at your crib with your kids saying "fuck your fort
Lil' nigga!"

[Verse 6: El-P]
The style is radiation leak at Mile Island
Also known as Chernobyl talk, listen for the sirens
For the green I'm a hoarder, you're the poor distorter
Sorta morbid sonnin' these fuckin' whoredome explorers, I'm bored
Enough of your bummy shit, it's numb to the core, sure
You suck a good dick for the fame and couldn't resist getting played
I fuck like I'm headed to war, I'm really not playing no games
But tag me god damn it I'll kill the carrier mentions my name

[Verse 7: Killer Mike]
Hey, I'm a soldier of fortune, a mercenary on beat
I'm merciless, I'll torture emcees, tie up both of they feet
If they refuse to run the jewels we beat the bottoms of feet
I'm talking grip pliers, guys, to the top of your teeth
Hey me and Jaime killed the competition, top of the heap
Is where we staying when they corpses resting under our feet
I sent they mom a little cash and a sympathy letter
Told her she raised a bunch a fuck boys, next time do better
Bitch

[Verse 8: Big Boi]
We the old Atlanta, new Atlanta, future of the city
Daddy Fat Saxx don't give a damn cause can't nann new niggas get with me
Now it's true, niggas are simply simple minded simple Simons
Being dumbed down by the local radio stations by designing
But what I be rhyming, no payola is required
My bank account obese as fuck while yours sits on a diet
Nigga your lease is up, you're fired
Quiet, that's how the boss talk
Retain ownership on everything, every car bought
And paid for, no neighbors cause I'm sitting on acres
Went to Vegas, jumped the broom cause I wasn't trippin' on papers
Or no prenuptual agreement for mama
If we broke up and she took half I'd still be sitting on commas
Eight figures nigga
