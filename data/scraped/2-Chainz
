Ladies order up the champagne, a whole lot of it
Painkillers, ain't got backpain, know you gotta love it
Tens out in NY, they in my hallways, I got a lobby of 'em
Up and Down with Chase, Monday nights, we made a hobby of it
Still down with the same dogs, man, they never loved us
Gave my niggas all gold chains to remind me of it
We're still holdin' that old thing, tryna rob me of it
One time for the trill bitches that'll let me touch it
I'm papi though, they get it poppin' with me when I'm out in public
Flyin' through, I got a young 'Yonce with a Iggy on her
Me and Metro do the same drugs, got a lot of it
All these cups and damn, all these hoes, these niggas up to somethin'
Touch down out in H-Town, there it might get ugly
It's trill niggas, where it's niggas, a whole army of 'em
I run the  check up, I'm a hot nigga, don't tell my 'countant on me
Free Rowdy Rowdy, free Bobby Bobby, them the Shmurda homies

Hop on the private I do it, take all the mollies I do it
The Bentley put up with no mileage I do it
These Styrofoams with me legitimate

My bathtub the size of swimming pools
Backstroke to my children room
Maybach in the living room
I spent racks on these tennis shoes
Niggas know what I'm finna do
Time for me to put the mink up
Forgiattos on a Brinks truck
My favorite rapper drove a pink truck
I do shit that you dreamed of
I was born with a mean mug
I was born with sum' nappy hair
Drinkin' breast milk out a lean cup
Tity Boi's my alias
Real niggas my radius
Trill niggas on the song with me
(Only trill niggas I know)
If she bad as hell I'll pay the babysitter
In a black Mercedes with her
Doin' about 180 with her
I was born a hustler, paraphernalia in my baby pictures
Resident all eloquent, leather shit in my front yard
TV by my swimming pool, got it built like a sports bar
Chevelle with a new motor, got the bitch like a sports car
Yeah, my name is Tity Boi, I don't fuck with hoes that wear sports bras
Crib bigger than your imagination
Call the trap house the gas station
Call momma's house the Jag station
Emoji sad faces
Look at these niggas
I need to buy pocketbooks for these niggas

You should print the lyrics out and have a fuckin' read-along
Ain't a fuckin' sing-along 'less you brought the weed along
Then ju.. (Okay, I got it)
Then just drop down and get yo' eagle on
Or we can stare up at the stars and put the Beatles on
All that shit you talkin' 'bout is not up for discussion
I will pay to make it bigger, I don't pay for no reduction
If it's comin' from a nigga I don't know, then I don't trust it
If you comin' for my head, then motherfucker get to bustin'

Vaca'd in Atlanta, then she goin' back to Cali, mmm

The irony, I fuck em at the same damn time
She eyeing me like a nigga don't exist
Girl, I know you want this dick

I want to par-ty (Huh?)
You want to par-ty (Yeah?)
We need to par-ty (Cool)
Let's have a par-ty (Lemme get up)

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Saturday mornin', I ain't gotta work
Last night's show sold a lot of merch
Bad bitch in my bed so I ain't gotta jerk
Forbes List caught me so it's hard to make the dollar hurt
All we need is good green and some Bou Lou
Five to one so its guaranteed you can do you
'Zilla keep the heater just in case we have a boo-boo
Kansas City natives and we all a lil' coo-coo

[Hook: B.o.B]
This the type of shit to make the hood go crazy
On the interstate doin' 180
She said, "do it for me, baby"
Took a double shot and then we all went crazy
White girls go crazy
Black girls go crazy
College girls go crazy
This the type of shit to make the hood go crazy

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
So much liquor, I never spare that kitchen
Keep it so I usually have a pair that's kissin'
And I'm lifted on purple hair, that's bitchin'
Now that's what I call a fuckin' air Technician
Check down there, they got the hair that's missin'
Keep it bare, I promise I'll never tear that kitten
I am aware sex hittin' is the care when I share that stick and
So good I might impair that vision
So I dip in, then dip off
Look for another chick, then they pissed off
Till I give them another spliff then they lift off
Party is the mission, I did cross
Three thick friends, we mixin' these licks when
They big friend wanna lip off
So I told her kindly to get lost, bitch
This my place and it's way too turnt up to trip off shit

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Yeah, you my prototype
My fourth foreign car was a Porsche photo white
Cooler than a polar bear in a bowl of ice
With a ring, married to the game, had 'em throwin' rice
Wait a minute, put my thing in her
I'm trynna knock up, I'm trynna put a singer in her
So I can do a banger with her
I get brain for dinner
I don't need to put tender for contender
Thank god for strippers
High top with zippers, hard as some nipples
All the shit I do is straight off the temple
Trynna squeeze it into my schedule is like a pimple
Tell that poodle, "don't mess around with them pitbulls."

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]
This the endin' from the N9ne
Grindin' bitches from behind
If you way drunk off the 'yac
Spit it up, spit it up, spit it up
This Kansas City, shit's ran gritty
In the summer time, the chicks be damn pretty
Born in the projects, then to the Ville
Then I did a deal with Travis and made mills
This is celebration, this is elevation
Me and my delegation got niggas hella hatin'
This is Nnutthowze, Regime, Rogue Dog
And it's all Strange Music, winners can't lose it, unless
Errbody got they hands up like (Oooh!)
See a bad bitch like (Wooah!)
This whole damn city fuckin' go
But this is how the hood go crazy in the MO

I'm poppin' too, these blue dolphins need two coffins
All she want is some heel money, all she need is some bill money
He take his time, he counts it out, I weighs it up, that's real money
Check the neck, check the wrist, them heads turnin', that's exorcist
My Audemar like Mardi Gras, that's Swiss time and that's excellence
Two-door preference, roof gone, George Jefferson
That white frost on that pound cake so your Duncan Hines is irrelevant

Cause the amount of stripe weh deh pon our shoulder

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Let the suicide doors up
I threw suicides on the tour bus
I threw suicides on the private jet
You know what that mean, I'm fly to death
I step in Def Jam buildin' like I'm the shit
Tell 'em give me fifty million or I'ma quit
Most rappers' taste level ain't at my waist level
Turn up the bass 'til it's up-in-your-face level
Don't do no press but I get the most press kit
Plus, yo, my bitch make your bitch look like Precious
Somethin' 'bout Mary, she gone off that molly
Now the whole party is melted like Dalí
Now everybody is movin' they body
Don't sell me apartment, I'll move in the lobby
Niggas is loiterin' just to feel important
You gon' see lawyers and niggas in Jordans

[Verse 4: 2 Chainz]
Okay, now ketchup to my campaign, coupe the color of mayonnaise
I'm drunk and high at the same time, drinkin' champagne on the airplane (Tell em!)
Spit rounds like the gun range, beat it up like Rampage
Hundred bands, cut your girl, now your girl need a Band-Aid
Grade A, A1, chain the color of Akon
Black diamonds, backpack rhyming, co-signed by Louis Vuitton
Horsepower, horsepower, all this Polo on, I got horsepower
Pound of this cost four thousand, I make it rain, she want more showers
Rain pourin', all my cars is foreign
All my broads is foreign, money tall like Jordan

These bitches gotta start paying me for this
Can't get no more free Randy"

[Hook: Drake]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got, nigga don't watch that cause I
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Money on my mind, you should think the same, J's on, pinky ring
Dogging these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
(Ah) She want all the fame, I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me, I said, "Baby girl, fall in line"
Okay, made a million, off a dinner fork, watch me switch it up
Walked in, "Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!"
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing, Givenchy, nigga God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime, I'd be arrested (Truu)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Drake]
I touched down in '86, knew I was the man by the age of 6
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit
But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans, homie don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit, and my latest shit is like a greatest hits
God damn, ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all
It's no different over on this side
God damn, should I listen to everybody or myself?
Cause myself just told myself:
"You're the motherfucking man, you don't need no help"
Cashing checks and I’m bigging up my chest
Y'all keep talking ‘bout who next
But I’m about as big as it gets, I swear y'all just wasting y'all breath
I’m the light skinned Keith Sweat, I'mma make it last forever
It’s not your turn ‘cause I ain't done yet
Look, just understand that I’m on a roll like Cottonelle
I was made for all of this shit
And I’m on the road box office sales, I’m getting paid for all of this shit
Ask you to please excuse my table manners
I was making room for the table dancers
Cause if we judging off your advances, then I just got paid like eight advances
God damn!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Ho, shut the fuck up!
I got way too much on my mental, I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do and still waking up like the rent's due
Not complicated, it's simple, I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everything -- everything but gentle
But I still take my time, man, I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit, that's old fashion
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
I plead the fifth, drink a fifth
Load the nine, leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit, probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues, I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom and still gotta pull out
But that's just me, and I ain't perfect, I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it, niggas still hating but it ain't working
Lil' bitch...

[Verse 4: Drake]
Oh me, oh me, oh my
I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
'Fore the end of this year, I'll do King of Diamonds three more times
Smoking on that kush all in our section like it's legalized
Girl, you can't always have your way, sometimes it be like that
They dont really fuck with you like that, they ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got the shine, I let you eat like that
I've been taught to never loan somebody what you need right back
And I need that shit right back? (no more free Randy)
I’m blessed than a motherfucka
Niggas been stressed than a motherfucka
Niggas getting nervous, clutching they chests like a motherfucka
Damn that’s a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don’t listen to you
‘Cause I don’t like being lied to
And that ship won’t sail
And that wind won’t guide you
Daddy was in jail we was talking through the window like a motherfucking drive-thru
That was back then man, now my niggas rich enough to do whatever I do[Produced by Sonny Digital with co-production from Kanye West, Lifted, Mike Dean, BWheezy and Anthony Kilhoffer]

Hair weave killer going on a trapathon
See I done had more bombs than Pakistan
Dope bomb, dro bomb, and a pill bomb

She holding out, she ain't giving to the needy huh
You go downstairs and fall asleep with the TV on
Ya'll been together ten years, you deserve a ménage
Especially if you put that BMW in the garage
Especially if you paid a couple payments on her Mamma crib
Went to her niece's graduation, man I hate those kids
Last birthday she got you a new sweater
Put it on, give her a kiss, and tell her do better
She said how bout I get you jewelry from the West End
How bout she hit the Westin and get her best friend
I'm joking, I'm just serious, I asked her
Don't be acting like no actress, if we preaching then we practice
Don't be reaching, don't be touching shit

Tell the DJ play your song, this shit come on

They ask me what I do and who I do it for
When I die, bury me inside the booty club
Get it girl, get it girl, get it get it girl

Went and got a mansion, went and got a maid
Naw I ain’t got a deal, but I got a Wraith
I call my clientele, I’m sorry for the wait
All these pounds in my traphouse, feel like I’m out of shape
These bitches love me man, I’m drinking muddy man
Drop a four in a ginger ale, it tastes like bubbly man
Young nigga hit a lick now you can’t tell me nothing man

[Hook x2 – Young Dolph]
Pulled up in a Porsche, pulled off in a Wraith
Pulled up in a Porsche, pulled off in a Wraith
Pulled up in a Porsche, pulled off in a Wraith
I saw my old bitch yesterday, you should’ve seen her face

[Verse 2 – 2 Chainz]
Pulled up in a Porsche, that bitch too anemic
Got that Rolls Royce, that bitch too conceited
Then I got them feet, had to get a pedi
Bought Keisha the Audi, you other niggas petty
Bet you ain’t got more money than harmony in heaven
Flat black Chevy, flat black MAC 11
I’m rolling up by the pound, you rolling up by the seven
Walk in the room with the black and white fur, that bitch that look like a panda
I put the slang in the gram, I just might loan your fam
I do this shit for Atlanta, shoot that bitch up with a cannon
All that I want is some Act, whip that shit up with a Fanta
Niggas don’t know how to act, when I pull up bitches pull out the cameras

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3 – Juicy J]
Pulled up in that 9 11, pulled off in a Wraith
This my second one this year, it still got paper plates
I’m laughing out the lot the way I’m laughing to the bank, ha ha
All you niggas standing in line, you need more food to fill my plate
Swear you pussy niggas sweeter than some crème brulee
I got niggas in the kitchen that’ll razorblade your face
I’m frying chicken in my fucking Wraith, ghetto nigga
Eating Dodger’s chicken in my fucking Wraith, what can I say
Greasy fingers, spill some hot sauce on that leather suede ceiling
Barbeque interior, collard green exterior
All these cars outside I can’t decide which one to drive
And all these hoes outside I can’t decide which one I want inside

[Hook x2][Hook]
100, 100, 100, 100 (x8)
You know I keep it (x4)

[Pusha T]
My life is but a dream pullin' cars up
Told you motherfuckers keys open doors up
Never excited when I'm seen with something gorgeous
Put highway miles on these bitches like a tour bus
Daddy Warbucks, without a born trust
Diamonds all on this black gold like an oil rush
The highest quality, the chains are all flush
Known Jacob since the nineties so he spoils us
Stock spoilers, no kits on 'em
Why Panamera, nine-eleve shits on 'em
Chuck the deuce as I Tokyo drift on 'em
The top drops like this Bangladesh heat on 'em

[Hook]
100, 100, 100, 100, you never keep it (x4)

[Jadakiss]
Yo, get yourself a hundred years tryin' to be the boss
Stand next to the chandeliers, you could see the shards
Ain't no diamonds in the watch, but you see the cross
When you spoon feed them that dope they need it more
All night, sweet sales
Four pipes, V twelves
Yeah, you know what them grams do
Bad bitch with me that the industry ain't ran through
Na, I ain't stop hustling yet, but I plan to
Own a bunch of vehicles and a bunch of land too
Yeah and I love it when the rush come
Ain't no secret that I keep it ninety-nine plus one

[Hook x2]
100, 100, 100, 100, you know I keep it
100, 100, 100, 100, you never keep it

[Mr. Bangladesh]
Y'all niggas fifty-fifty I keep it a hundred
I spit the truth in interviews, I keep it one hundred
I'm the shit, smell the fumes, my nigga we plungin'
And the 808s on a leash, they say it's a monster
Got my own label, fucked around and signed myself
Had a plan and stuck to it, you fuckboys is stuck boy
Bangladesh new shit ropin' like a cowboy
On my Tony Romo shit, you niggas just some towel boys
Tell the whole world to suck my cockiness
My checks eight figures like a octopus
Three hundred thou for the watch and rocky shit
These other niggas fakin' and I ain't afraid to say I keep it

[Hook x2]

[2 Chainz]
A hundred miles and running, nigga with an attitude
Bitch I'm so fly, you should check the altitude
I'm ballin', ballin' like an alley-oop
My girl heel so high she need a parachute
Get 'em, I got 'em let me at 'em
My condo on Jupiter, my neighbors on Saturn
Murcielago, flow with some eye candy
I go to trial Monday, I been takin' panties
Hundred degrees in the mic booth
I'm from where you put golds on the white tooth
And when you walk in and she might look
Might get took, might get fucked
A bunch of bitches in the skip line
I'm known to get mine ten out of ten times
I paid a hundred thousand for the old school
Known to keep it one hundred on the Pro Tools

[Hook x2][Hook 1: Nelly]
I am so faded, might put fifty on the ladies
100k tomorrow, money in the bag
I'm so faded, might put fifty on the ladies
100k tomorrow, money in the bag

[Verse 1: Nelly]
50k today a 100 more tomorrow
Hustle what I want man I'll forever ball
Money coming heavy never weigh a little
It's either high or low it's never in the middle
Ice buckets nigga for the gold ace
Big cash duffle bag with the gold lace
Heard a nigga say throw in the towel
Numbers speak the truth these niggas out here in denial

[Hook 2: Nelly]
I am so faded, 10,000 square feet gated
100k tomorrow, money in the bag
I'm so faded, might put fifty on the ladies
100k tommorrow, money in the bag

[Verse 2: Nelly]
50k today, 100k tommorrow
Rollie Sundays, Monday Audemar
Tuesday in the photo, Wednesday in the two door
Thursday's made for fucking Friday's back to getting you know
You in that right place again
Face not American, body saying African
Fuck you with an uppercut, baby that won't take a lot
50k today we running money like a marathon
Yo bread, yo bed, yo booty lights on
Her phone playing your music like your music our songs
Give her that banana clip most of all her clothes on
Beatin' on my chest went through the roof top

[Hook 1]

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
So dope you could snort every line
When it's reppin time, whe- when it's reppin time
Told her I take her shoppin' after we fuck
Soon after we fuck I had to tell her never mind
You wouldn't know swag if it slapped you in the face
This that macaroni tony A1 on the steak
And designer shoe laces, gold on the bracelets
Got her in the back seat balls on her braces
Photo grails full of money stacks
You a blocker and nigga I got a hundred sacks
Ya, this the luxury distribution
Up so early got me arguing with the rooster
Tru university is my institution
Niggas couldn't graduate if you had tutor
One thing for sure, two things for certain
My crib got blinds, my car got curtains

[Hook 1][Hook: TeeFLii]
Girl, don’t hide that pussy
You should be the type to provide that pussy
And let a thug hit it
You ain’t gotta get dressed or do your hair
Girl, I got 24 hours, 24 hours
It's just me and you, I got 24 hours
24 hours, 24 hours
You won't have nothin' on, for 24 hours

[Verse 1: TeeFLii]
Yeah, you would look good with no make-up on
Sex, sex in the morning
You ain't no good girl, good girl, you a bad girl
You ain't no side chick, you know you fine
(You a thickie wit'cho cute ass)
I know everywhere you tired
We fuck then get some sleep
Wake up and do it all again!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: TeeFLii]
Walking around, combing your hair
And you know that I want it right here, yeah, yeah!
Catch you out you can clean it up
Yeah, lay you out on that couch
You know you fine (you fine)
Got long hair and don't care
I know everywhere you tatted
Fuck then get some sleep
Wake up and do it again!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
24/7 like the Waffle House
Three cell phones, still nothin' to talk about
Might pull your girl with the head nod
I used to off white like egg nog
My baby momma better than these R&B hoes
Towel on the floor, looking through the peep hole
I ask them who is it, they say room service
Give me one minute, she gettin her womb service! (Damn!)
South side nigga on the West Side
Still got a whole closet full of reptiles
A nigga ain't hard, he erectile
And I just beat it up I need a hand towel (Ooh!)

[Hook][2 Chainz]

My rhyme style real nonchalant
Trust me rude boy ain't what you want
Hit your ass up have you doing somersaults
Then I drop your trashy ass off in the garbage
Every week I get my car washed
This is the life of a hustler this is not facade
And what you looking at is not a mirage
You probably see me at the W having a Menage
Performing
Slap a little ass recording
Im doing 160 for my niggas in Porsches
They say I'm speeding cause im on that far left side
I'm from the south but im smoking on that west side
Im in my best ride
I let my girl wash clothes on the G4 so I can let the jet dry
I'm the best I know this
And you ain't even notice
Until I rode up on you in a Lotus
Brushing dust off my shoulders
Like fuck it im focused
Im fucking with bitches thats only fucking with soldiers
Now listen
I got a old school the color of Okra
The tires as wide as Oprah
Watching it when its approaching
Now listen
Peace up
A-Town down
You know I got that piece up so I won't play around
Got a extra round
Plus I got a clip on it
Pollute your block
I put all that shit on it

Karate kid bitch, I got a lot of kick
Smoking on that president, no politic
Some niggas getting rich, ain’t got no common sense
I woke up this morning I might buy your biz
If she look, look, look she get took, took
Two cups, two blunts longer than your foot
Hair long, money long, everything long
I’m a rapper so I fucked her with my chains on
James Bond swag, check my watch and swerve
Need a clock on my rims so they could watch the curve
I am high, so high I need a skyrocket
And it look like a phonebook in my pocket

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
Two cups, two blunts
I am high, so high I need a skyrocket

[Ree$e]
Yeah, it's 2 A.M. and I'm swishing through like two lanes
Got two dames and they only in a two things
Got drugs and sex, and yeah, they want it in like two ways
Enough to go around, they on that head like toupee
Young nigga, but I’m O.G
Like broke chain in two ways
You acting, I’m flexing
Get lost bitch, like loose change
Brought the son of a bitch that rock two chains
Got diamonds all on my tooth, hey
It's axed out, you assed out, for fashions I cast out
I hit the runway, tell the cameraman to pose me up
A couple bands every time a blogger post me up
(bandz a make her dance)
She wanna day when I go and eat that girl for lunch
Get two of this, cop two of those and doubles, that’s my blunt

[Hook: 2 Chainz]

[Boy Wonder]
Man, we loose, lock the door
Kick it like I’m wearing soccer clothes
Flex, nigga, stop and pose
I don’t rap, I do rock’n’roll
If she loud then she got to go
Hoover Dam can’t stop the flow
Yeah, I'm popping, ho
Just put it in your mouthlike a popsicle
Colder than an icicle, I ride on this beat like a bicycle
Chase ‘em in a mouse hole
Fuck you wearing, nigga, South Pole?
Take two shots of this Patron
And take two hits of this bomb dro
I'll leave you John Doe or drop you off in the Congo
Last of the Mohicans, shout out to my Puerto Ricans
Trinidad Jame$ flow ‘cause right now nigga I’m geekin'
Sweeping you shall find a hope, you find wherever you seeking
Two cups, two blunts, two mollys and it’s turnt up all the way season

Chevelle with a new motor, got the bitch like a sports car
Yeah, my name is Tity Boi, I don't fuck with hoes that wear sports bras

Young whippersnapper, I might eat that snapper
Got a yellow bitch, gotta whip to match her
All I know is soda bakin’, all them other niggas fakin’
Watch them niggas fall to pieces all them other niggas flakin'
Did it for my city sellin’ crack out my building
Now I ride around with a crack in the ceiling
Exhale, Ziplock, flip-flop with them burglar doors
Yeah, I got that hard work, nigga, you are unemployed
Residue all on the floor, just made a mill
So you know that’s what I’m hungry for, get it how you live

Fuck all these broke niggas cause all I do is ball
Ain't no more off days, my crib look like a mall
Fired the stylist, went and bought a big and tall

Graduated from them blocks, now it's stocks and bonds
Hoes wanna know, hoes wanna show
They know a nigga's name, they know a nigga's strong
Fuck wit me!

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
When I climb on top, I say I'm into you
A lot of chickens in the coupe; cock-a-doodle-doo
I fucked the secretary, fuck the interview
If I was in the NBA, I'd hoop in Gucci tennis shoes
Chopper spray like antihistamines
Triple beam, Versace swag on creatine
When I left the lot, I spent a half a milli
When I pulled up to your spot, I had a half a ceiling
Got your bitch with me, trying to suck up
I don't trust my chauffeur, so shut the fuck up
Uh, the new chopper hold a hundred rounds
When I park on the curb, the grill look like Bobby Brown

[Hook][Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I'm popular and poppin' dough
Breakfast at Pappadeaux's
Dodging all obstacles
Trapping at the Stop-N-Go
Boy you know you lame if you still riding stop and go
Disect the beat and then I turn it to a particle
Pardon though, I'm harder though
You should read the article
I'm riding high and dodging hoes
You better hope im dodging your
Model hoes dollar hoes, white looking Madonna hoes Dolce Gabbana, Ferragamo, and the Prada hoes
College ho Zone 3, niggas with a lot of gold
Snoop guard the door

Heres some food for thought, a little food for your soul
Like a comma, I love being right next to O's

[Hook:]
I had a long day
My nerves bad
Yea I'm smoking on loud I know you heard that
Hit the jewlery store, with a hundred grand
I can't help it im addicted to the rubberbands
Leave the trap house, with a hundred grand
I can't help it im addicted to the rubberbands
Time to re-up, I got a hundred bands,i can't help it im addicted to the rubberbands

[Verse 2: J Hard]
We sitting high speaking like we super human beings
Cars mulatto, black on black Europeans
Too hard to swallow like UGKings and
Number one thesis do you believe in Jesus
They say money is the root of all diseases
Well call the docotr I see honest in my thesis
Summer vacation, one trip two bricks
Baby momma saying im impatient my sons need shit
When you pull up to the front, all you see is whips
Diddy bop to the back all you see is zips
In zip locks, and garbage bags
Usher Raymond in this bitch yea I got it bad

Big dog, big broads all in my circumference
Pussy on lock down, I dont hand cuff it
Sipping Grey Goose and we spending mad doucets
Rubberband fetish get it in abundance
Ben Franklins back to back, hundreds on hundreds
Gucci flip flaps, I got bunyons on bunyons
Yellow ring look like a funyon, or somethin'
I just left the trap house, money on money

[Hook][Intro: Game]
Get my people out them chains nigga
I mean handcuffs, time to man up
Put my hands up? Fuck you sayin' bruh
Cause I'm a black man, in a Phantom

You mad cause your daughter fuck with me on spring break
Well, I'mma fuck her 'til the springs break

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Yeah, roll another one cause I’m winnin
In my four door looking real photogenic
Gentleman attire, in threads that won’t expire
I’m in a class of my own, my teacher got fired
Money getting long, pussy rate keep rising
Versace outfit cost me 3,000
From the P houses, did it from the wee hours
Selling that chicken no lemon pepper, no sweet and sour
First you get the power, then you get respect
I’m getting so much money I can buy ya bitch
Take it how you wanna, if you wanna take it
I like clubs where all the women working naked
Fell in love with a waitress what the fuck I’m thinking
Bought that ho a ring it was for her pinky
Uhn, that’s pimpin’ that’s slick
Got a bottle of cologne that cost more than your rent

[Verse 2: Game]

And my AR see murders, that's beef nigga no burgers

Got coke swimming in that glass jar, bitch go turn on them burners
Got dope to sell in this hotel, no half price, no retail
You a bitch nigga, no female, I smack niggas, Sprewell

Thank God that a nigga seen another day

I take my case to trial, hire the Dream Team
Robbie Kardashian, Johnnie Cochran, I seen things
I dream big, I think sharp
Inhale smoke, Hawaiian tree bark
Humble yourself, you not a G, keep it one with yourself
Run to niggas for help, favors I keep one on the shelf
I got rifles with lasers, swing it just like the majors
Hit you right above navel, now you swimming in pavement
Gold medals on my neck, I call it Michael Phelps
Hoes settling for less, I call 'em bottom shelf
Niggas tough on them blogs and never did nothing at all
On the road to the riches, bitches not tagging along

[Verse 5: Game]
..Unless it's ass in a thong, hit that ass and I'm gone
Disrespect my nigga Boss and I'm flashing the chrome
I'm waving the Tec, Tity spraying the Mac
Extendos in the back, gonna lap
Got a bitch that look like Laila Ali sitting in my lap
Got a call from Skateboard, pick 'em up at Lax
Speaking skateboards, where Tune at?
Fuck with him, I'll break a skateboard on a nigga back

Skateboard on a nigga track
No lie, No Lie already got a plaque
Mama got a house, daughter got accounts
Just to think a nigga like me started with a ounce
Bad bitches and D-boys, we bring 'em out
If them niggas pussy, we douche 'em, we clean 'em out
This the voice of ghetto intelligence
If you got work, go to work, don't work at your residence

[Verse 7: Game]
...For presidents
Word to Muhammad, that triple beam is heaven-sent
Riding through the jungles in that muthafuckin' elephant
That's a gray ghost, with the ears on it
Swimming through the hood like it got fins on it (Tell 'em!)
You know I got that work on the foreman grill
Weigh the muthafuckas in, made another mill'
Got a nigga feeling like Cassius Clay
Thrilla in Manilla, nigga want it whip his ass today

[Hook 2][Intro: Trinidad James (T.I.)]
Yeah, you already know man
It's your boy, T. James
Ain't doing a verse on my shit, I already killed it
Let the legends holla at ya, Tip
(Yeah, I'm talking true A-town trap shit, ya understand that?)
(It the king homeboy, hey Trinidad, dig this homes)

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Big bank, all I do is get bank
Niggas hating on me but they bitch ain't
So conceited, I don't think my shit stank
400,000 dollars on a Mulsanne
Come and kick it with a west side nigga
Think I ain't about that action, wanna bet my nigga?
All day thumbing through the check my nigga
Boy you're broke, you can't even be a threat my nigga
When you're talking to me say it with your chest little nigga
I pull up on your set and make a mess little nigga
Okay, I got a kilo of gold 36 O's
Wrapped around the neck of a dope boy
Gold yacht, that's the presi' diamond in those
And just paid cash for a Rolls Royce
A true trap nigga, I done sold everything
Trouble man, hustle gang, all gold everything
I said trouble man, hustle gang, all gold everything

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
Bought a gold bottle now we on the Dom
Big faced Rollie take up half my arm
Porsche 911 with the Gabby top
All gold scale, that's my magic box
Got the soft, my nigga
Give me thirty minutes, I'll be right with ya
Got the hard, my nigga
Let me whip this here I'll get it right to ya
Goddamn, I'm turnt up
I think the knob just broke and I don't give a fuck
Goddamn, I'm fucked up
The streets dry as hell, this work high as fuck
She want white, boy, dudes take it easy man
Shit I'd pay less for a pair of Yeezy's man
All I wanna know if I'mma bounce with her
Talking me to death like I'm a counselor
She popped a Molly I'm guessing
But if she throwing the pussy I'm catching
.223 with a silencer
Gonna rock that shit with the flyest fur
All gold like Montana (Tony)
Hoes all in my phantom (Rollies)
Young done killed the gold remix
A nigga don't like it, God damn him

[Hook: Trinidad James]
Gold all in my chain, gold all in my ring
Gold all in my watch
Don't believe me, just watch
Nigga nigga nigga
Don't believe me, just watch
Don't believe me, just watch
Nigga nigga nigga
Don't believe me, just watch
Don't believe me, just watch
Gold all in my chain, gold all in my ring
Gold all in my watch, don't believe me just watch

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Ibn all on my head, snakeskin all in my hat
Hit your girl with my chains on so that's gold all on her back
Gold all on my watch, so big it's like a clock
Some people wear fox fur, on the Source cover I wore a fox
This for all the DJ's that got this on replay
I sell a brick on eBay, then I celebrate
Several bitches in every state
I'm in Miami with Wayne trying to skate, my family straight
Ayo, ho 'bout to hyperventilate, I owe her one, we did a 68
I say hoes, my nigga, them ain't red bottoms, her bottom brown
I'm smoking strong, my nigga, I'm on loud, not Bobby Brown
That's souf side up in here, I spell "souf" with a F
F stand for fuck y'all if you ain't fucking with my set
Fuck with me and I'm busting, fuck with me and I'm busting
Every time you see me think about what it would be if I ain't do nothing
Damn right, I'm stunting, damn right, I'm styling
Just got a girl chauffeur and we on a motorcycle and she driving
This Versace, that Versace, this Versace, too
I got killers watching, niggas watching, bitches watching me too
See I'm on lean, on loud, and I got my own lane
You need to mind your own business, it's 2 Chainz and Trinidad (James)

[Hook]

[Outro: Trinidad James]
A'int shit changed, I still don't fuck with fuck niggas
And if you a fuck nigga I'm talking 'bout you
Your bitch said she popped a molly, she sweating
Woo
A-Town bitch[Intro]
Yeah, it’s hard to explain it
The feeling I have when I’m on stage man

[Hook]
They turn the lights down
And open the curtains
And all the fans stand up and they start roaring
Go Tity Boi [4x]

[2 Chainz talking]

I mean that’s what this whole mixtape is about
All Ice On Me

Getting them checks homie[Produced by Key Wane]

[Intro: Aziz Ansari (from the movie "Funny People")]
"I'm really stepping up my game
These bitches gotta start paying me for this
Can't get no more free Randy"

[Hook: Drake]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got, nigga don't watch that cause I
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Money on my mind, you should think the same, J's on, pinky ring
Dogging these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
(Ah) She want all the fame, I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me, I said, "Baby girl, fall in line"
Okay, made a million, off a dinner fork, watch me switch it up
Walked in, "Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!"
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing, Givenchy, nigga God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime, I'd be arrested (Truu)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Drake]
I touched down in '86, knew I was the man by the age of 6
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit
But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans, homie don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit, and my latest shit is like a greatest hits
God damn, ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all
It's no different over on this side
God damn, should I listen to everybody or myself?
Cause myself just told myself:
"You're the motherfucking man, you don't need no help"
Cashing checks and I’m bigging up my chest
Y'all keep talking ‘bout who next
But I’m about as big as it gets, I swear y'all just wasting y'all breath
I’m the light skinned Keith Sweat, I'mma make it last forever
It’s not your turn ‘cause I ain't done yet
Look, just understand that I’m on a roll like Cottonelle
I was made for all of this shit
And I’m on the road box office sales, I’m getting paid for all of this shit
Ask you to please excuse my table manners
I was making room for the table dancers
Cause if we judging off your advances, then I just got paid like eight advances
God damn!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Ho, shut the fuck up!
I got way too much on my mental, I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do and still waking up like the rent's due
Not complicated, it's simple, I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everything -- everything but gentle
But I still take my time, man, I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit, that's old fashion
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
I plead the fifth, drink a fifth
Load the nine, leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit, probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues, I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom and still gotta pull out
But that's just me, and I ain't perfect, I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it, niggas still hating but it ain't working
Lil' bitch...

[Verse 4: Drake]
Oh me, oh me, oh my
I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
'Fore the end of this year, I'll do King of Diamonds three more times
Smoking on that kush all in our section like it's legalized
Girl, you can't always have your way, sometimes it be like that
They dont really fuck with you like that, they ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got the shine, I let you eat like that
I've been taught to never loan somebody what you need right back
And I need that shit right back? (no more free Randy)
I’m blessed than a motherfucka
Niggas been stressed than a motherfucka
Niggas getting nervous, clutching they chests like a motherfucka
Damn that’s a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don’t listen to you
‘Cause I don’t like being lied to
And that ship won’t sail
And that wind won’t guide you
Daddy was in jail we was talking through the window like a motherfucking drive-thru
That was back then man, now my niggas rich enough to do whatever I doYea I Ballin With 5hunna niggas yea we rollin keep thats red and yellow bannda hulk hogan alot of diss alot of dat my nigga u wack Glory Boyz Shit my Yagans keep diss 5hunna I ballin like no tomorrow

When I get me a check, I'mma eat her for breakfast
When I get me a check, niggas gotta respect it

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I earned all my stripes like A-Rod, worth 25 mill
That's a whole lot of money, man somebody get killed
Que pasa, que pasa, you know that I'm proper, I run with my partners
We need us a doctor, for drinkin' the vodka
That piña colada, I might shit a lobster
I just said that shit with my eyes closed
I can count a hundred thousand while I'm blindfolded
See you out, nigga, watch I get to it
CUI, nigga, mean the chopper under influence
Now watch how I limp to the bank, dreads hangin' under my A hat
If I got sucked by a teller, I would never tell you but that would be Bankhead
A1 nigga from the south side, I need a spot light
I need a chinchilla, before I get frostbite
Put the white girl in the middle, call it Klondike
Take her the to the room after dinner, and fuck her like it's prom night

[Hook]

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Move around my town like A-Rod
Playin' with that girl like Baywatch, Tony Hawk skate off
Steroid, on your ass like Hemorrhoids
Cash out with that pen boy, your pass out see the invoice
When I get that check, I'mma call Madonna
Call up Cameron Diaz, call up Daisy Fuentes
Dikembe on them hoes like no-no, not in my house, you can't stay
You can smoke and you can drink and bend it over, let me play
God dammit, I done came up, nigga
35K take the plane up, nigga - 35 cars, 35 chains, nigga
Gettin' this change, never changed up, nigga
When I get that check, I'ma buy you a fake ass
With your fake ass, we don't count money, weigh cash
Breakin' up the rock, Dame Dash
When you're talkin' 'bout work, was my day job
Playin' with the base like A-Rod
Playin' with them M's since yay high
Mix it up, drink it, stay high

[Hook: 2 Chainz][Intro: CyHi The Prince]
A-Town
CyHi, Travis Porter, B.o.B and my partner 2 Chainz

[Hook: Cyhi The Prince]
Okay, I represent for my city, hold it down for my town
I'm riding down I-20, hell yeah, east bound
Know real niggas in Bankhead, all the way to Stone Mountain
I'm throwing up the A-Town, throwing up the A-Town

[Verse 1: CyHi The Prynce]
Okay, I'm all about that red clay
From Stevenson back to West Lake
I got an old school that's red and grey
I put candy in it like eskay
Yeah, I don't mean sound cliché but I'm so G-A
Homie you can ask my DJ
Met the plug over there by the cheese cake
Don't think its sweet cause we serve it from the peach state
Me and Kanye riding down Redan
Throwing money out the roof yelling out Free Bandz
The motor in this bitch cost three grand
APD couldn't catch me with three hands
I'm back up on my A shit
That Big Boi Andre shit
That I'm Serious, that Trap or Die
Is the only thing on my playlist
I smoke swisher sweets when I chief blunts
Peters Street is where I eat lunch
Took your girl out to Lenox mall
She went downtown like Peidmont
Cause A-town my playground
I hate clowns that face frown
Cause it stay down from my waist down
Then I bus on em, Greyhound
Shawty yeen know your girl was a freak bitch
Today she let me hit for a 5 dollar bag of green
Now that's why I give her free dick

[Hook]

[Travis Porter]
Ok I'm sliding down on Lenox, keep evicting my crown
I hit the mall and I spend it, all this money I count
I remember the Poole Palace, I remember the Bounce
Throwing up the A-Town, throwing up the A-Town

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
80’s baby, Grady baby, my Auntie was a candy lady
And her baby had a baby, the A-town born and raised me
Southside, own that, Candler Road if I had to go back
Tony Wiggles on my throwback, had your feet on my door mat
Dirty South I know you heard about it, got loud I know you heard about it
Valley park I used to roll around, 2 Chainz with your girl around me
Two down, I'm too down, Kilo and Sammy Sam
Raheem and Outkast, Goodie Mob: ATL

[Hook]

[Verse 3: B.o.B]
Riding in the Cutlass smoking on a black
Man it don't get more Decatur than that
What's better than that
Ain't nothing better than that
Ain't nothing better than that
See through the bullshit like cellophane wrap
All the slick talk we don't entertain that
Better take a step back
Last nigga came 'round here talking shit, left and never came back
Nigga I'm high, high like eagle pussy
Rolling up a heavyweight rap
My crib lay back, my chick lay back
My seat lay back, yeah everything match
Niggas tryna act brave, man we the home of that
You looking for whatever it's a zone for that
Getting paper ain't nothing wrong with that
Yeah we bout that coin like a laundromat
Maybe Candler Road make me feel like this
Or maybe Outkast make me feel like this
Put your A's up if you feel like this
We get the Georgia Dome jumping like we still got Vick
It's a dirty game and they scared of that
Blame it on the red and black
What better than that
Ain't nothing better than that
Ain't nothing better than that

[Hook][Hook]
Swish, I'm balling
I'm so awesome
Old bitch keep calling
She think I'm awesome
Jackboys wanna rob me

I'm so fucking awesome, I'm so awesome
I'm so fucking awesome, I'm so awesome
I'm so fucking awesome, I'm so awesome

[Verse 1: Shy Glizzy]
Oh my fucking God, pull up in that, oh my gosh
You niggas so soft, get that arrow out your heart
You can be a boss or you can get a job
You do not go hard, you's a motherfucking fraud
Young Jefe, I got boats you can sail away
Broke boy, you are not my friend, you need to get away
Call up my driver tell him scoop me in his Escalate
Night Sunday, bet 1000 bucks on Tampa Bay
Got a lot of spots like a motherfucking cheetah
All we do is trap, my OGs still got beepers
Bad little kitty momma took my ass to jeepers
Tryna get a ticket like no money in the meter

[Hook]

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Cell phone ringing tryna blank it
In D.C getting money, DMV one hundred
Hair hanging down to my stomach
And I'm making play like DeShaun
And I'm ballin' out like John Wall
I just brought me a pound of gas
I'mma smoke joints till it's all gone
Okay awwsome, in a Porsche eating lobster
2 chains on with crosses, lipstick stain on balls
I ain't with the losses, the process is nonsense
Whip, sit in all set, might give her the sausage
Me and Skooly walk, talk down to the car
Hit her with the dick, leave her with a beauty mark
She say we all the same, I say "bitch come hit this reefer"
She say that "I don't like them niggas", I say "I don't like 'em either"

[Hook]

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
A$AP tatted on my belly like I'm Makaveli
That peanut butter product probably why they acting jelly
You actin' petty, packin' daily cause my chain heavy
Flaco be in D.C. like I'm Wayne Perry
I beat that, speak that awwsome
She wanna have a foursome
She know more friends so call some
Call them often for the moresome
Exhaust 'em, boss 'em, toss 'em
Loss 'em like abortion
Window shopping notion
Wasted times important
Problems with it cost 'em
All you boys fugazy, I got hoes for days
My rugged lookin' J's bout as stainless as my braids
But I'm paid, shout glizzy
DMV that's NYC, TX, LA we talk fly shit
Get off my dick if you don't like this
Cause I'm like

[Hook][Verse 1: Count]
Grinding all winter, now I'm back for the summer
Throwin' Hundreds out the sun roof cause I'm a stunner
Thought she was the one till I heard she was a runner
Went behind her back gave all her friends my number
She roll another blunt up, blowin' till I pass out
Made it rain twenty racks still pullin' cash out
Mashed out the lot made the Vet' do a tailspin
Pipes growlin' like a pit bull at the mailman
Got buyout money check, got shooters on deck
That's why I walk around with thirty-thousand on my neck
They show respect because they know my background
It's summertime, tell them bitch niggas I'm back now


[Bridge: Mooney]
Pockets so thick like I just hit the number
Ran through it all now I'm back on the come-up
Pulling something slick that'll make these niggas wonder
Told y'all bitches I'd be straight by the summer

[Hook: Count and Mooney]
Told y'all bitches/Right Back 4 Da Summer
I Told y'all bitches/Right Back 4 Da Summer
I Told y'all bitches/Right Back 4 Da Summer
I Told y'all bitches/I'd be straight by the summer

Right Back 4 Da Summer
I Told y'all bitches/Right Back 4 Da Summer
I Told y'all bitches/Right Back 4 Da Summer
I Told y'all bitches/I'd be straight by the summer


[Verse 2: Mooney]
I-I-I ain't got nothing else to tell you
Promise I'll be straight while y'all was expecting a failure
Fucking up ya' plans though, sweet taste of victory
So for the time being y'all relaxing when it's history
Porsche Panamera, or the White Maserati
I'm doing me but these all hoes is for everybody
Ran through it all, but homie I will never fall
When the club make it rain that shit is like a mating call
Pockets just like I won the mega millions
It bring me great pleasure to know I hurt these niggas feelings
Whatever you do I always got 1-up
Had a rough winter, but I'll be back by the summer

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Cargo shorts white V-Neck
Big feet on the car like a T-Rex
I got my music up and my top perm
That means its laying down 24's on the curl
Twenty birds on the stove I get it cooked cheap
Three birds everyday it's been a good week
Sold two birds Sunday cause I went to church
And since it's summertime I guess I'm going with the Verse
All these chains on a nigga need two necks
I don't fuck with groupies but I have group sex
2 Chainz name ringing like a telephone
And all I eat is beats, and yellowbones


[Bridge]

[Hook][Hook: Tyga]
All day long
Do it like Tony
Fuck her friend
Then I pass her to the big homie
Got a sign on my dick
Bad bitches only

Bad bitches only
Big bank roll

Fuck her friend
Then I pass her to the big homie
Got a sign on my dick
Bad bitches only

Well it's that nigga you call T-raw

Call that bitch Rondo
I'm fresher than the prom ho
Teach her, we don't fly coach
She fuckin' but she act dumb
Kick her out my condo
Real G's, Last King, Young Money ballin'
I give her a couple of shots and then she turned an alcoholic
Methaphorically I'm a toilet
And I'm shittin' on your foreheads
2 girls 1 cup
Yup
We did it again Last King, YMCMB
I don't pay for bitches
Bitches pay me uhh

[Hook: Tyga]

[Verse 2: Gudda Gudda]
Knock knock
Who the fuck is there?
Sign on my dick that say
Bad bitches come in here
Make a freak whore, detour
Straight to my partner room and let him beat it like a keyboard
All I do is dick em'
I don't tip em' like a stripper
Man I gotta' ton of chicks under my belt
Like a zipper
Yeah
Walk up in the club
Pick em' out and then I pick em' off
Pick em' up and knock em' down
And then I drop em' off
I'mma dog
Keep you girl from around my type
Or she'll be milkbox material
And missin' for the night
Man this shit is just that easy
When yo' pockets sittin' right
I turn my bed into a stage
And let yo' bitch rock on my mic

[Hook: Tyga]

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
First I check my Rolley
Then say "watch me do it"
Watch me do it, show you how to cook like Martha Stewart
I want some cheesecake I have you walkin' to it
Plus I stack my money tall don't you walk in to it
Just do it all I do is smoke jet fluid
Fuck her with my chain on so my charm can hit her booty
Outrageous with the Louis I'm a fashionaire
Ever since 16 I been a fuckin' thousandaire
They know me by my nickname in the dealership
And all my shows are funeral homes I keep killin' shit
You used to get money so you reminisce
And if yo' bitch get with this she'll get benefits

[Hook: Tyga]
