[Intro]
(I reminisce, I reminisce) x3
I reminisce, I reminisce
Uh! (I reminisce, I reminisce)
Yeah (I reminisce, I reminisce)
(I reminisce, I reminisce)
(I reminisce, I reminisce)

[Verse 1: C.L. Smooth]
I reminisce for a spell, or shall I say think back
22 years ago to keep it on track
The birth of a child on the 8th of October
A toast but my granddaddy came sober
Countin all the fingers and the toes
Now I suppose, you hope the little black boy grows, huh
18 years younger than my mama
But I rarely got beatings cause the girl loved drama
In single parenthood there I stood
By the time she was 21, had another one
This one's a girl, let's name her Pam
Same father as the first but you don't give a damn
Irresponsible, plain not thinking
Papa said chill but the brother keep winking
Still he won't down you or tear out your hide
On your side while the baby maker slide
But mama got wise to the game
The youngest of five kids, hon here it is
After 10 years without no spouse
Momma's gettin married in the house
Listen, positive over negative for the women and master
Mother Queen's risin a chapter
Déjà vu, tell you what I'm gonna do
When they reminisce over you, my God

[Bridge 1: Pete Rock]
My God
It's so
Yeah, so lovely
That's how we like to do it in the 90's
Pete Rock & CL Smooth comin' atcha

[Verse 2: C.L. Smooth]
When I date back I recall a man off the family tree
My right hand Poppa Doc I see
Took me from a boy to a man so I always had a father
When my biological didn't bother
Taking care of this so who am I to bicker
Not a bad ticker but I'm clocking pop's liver
But you can never say that his life is through
5 kids at 21 believe he got a right too
Here we go while I check the scene
With the Portugese Lover at the age of 14
The same age, front page, no fuss
But I bet you all your dough, they live longer than us
Never been senile, that's where you're wrong
But give the man a taste and he's gone
Noddin' off, sleep to a jazz tune
I can hear his head banging on the wall in the next room
I get the pillow and hope I don't wake him
For this man do cuss, hear it all in verbatim
Telling me how to raise my boy unless he's taking over
I said pop maybe when you're older
We laughed all night about the hookers at the party
My old man standing yelling good God, almighty
Use your condom, take sips of the brew
When they reminisce over you, for real

[Bridge 2: Pete Rock]
For real, baby
Like that
We for real
Comin' atcha
In '92
Pete Rock & CL Smooth
Yeah, c'mon, hit me!

[Verse 3: C.L. Smooth]
I reminisce so you never forget this
The days of wayback, so many bear witness the fitness
Take the first letter out of each word in this joint
Listen close as I prove my point
T to the R the O-Y, how did you and I meet?
In front of Big Lou's, fighting in the street
But only you saw what took many time to see
I dedicate this to you for believing in me
Rain or shine, yes in any weather
My grandmom Pam holds the family together
My Uncle Doc's the greatest better yet the latest
If we're talking about a car, Uncle Sterling got the latest
I strive to be live cause I got no choice
And run my own business like my Aunt Joyce
So Pete Rock hit me, nuff respect due
When they reminisce over you, listen

[Outro: Pete Rock]
Listen, just listen
To the funky song as I rock on
And that's word is bond
I'm not playin
Everybody, just coolin
This song we dedicate
To the one and only
Never be another
He was my brother
Trouble T-Roy
It's like that y'all
And you don't stop
Pete Rock and CL Smooth for '92
And we out, later[Produced by Simonsayz and B Sides; Additional production by Lupe Fiasco and Chill]

[Verse 1]
First off, say "Peace" to Pine Ridge
Shame at all the damage that the white man wine did
Ghost Dance, Trail of Tears, five million beers a year
And all that other crime did
More peace to the teachers of blind kids
To rebels in small cells keeping their mind big
Say everything's hostile
Suicide bombers and prosperity gospels, emaciated models
With cocaine and blood pouring out their nostrils, they got to
Just to stay awake on the catwalk of life where everybody watch you
Straight hair, high heels and a handbag
Crucifixes, racism and a land grab
Katrina, FEMA trailers, human body sandbags
A peace sign and a pants sag
A money toss cause a nine stripper mad dash
A friend request following a hash tag
Now everybody want it like the last laugh
A Michael Jackson jacket or a Daft mask
Purple Jordans or the mixed girl in your math class
Stable is when the Ba'ath had Baghdad
But corporate jets really had to have that gas bad
War and they hope they all fall from the ratatat
Cause that's just more dinosaur for the Cadillac

[Hook]
Live from the other side what you see
A bunch of nonsense on my TV
Heaven on Earth is what I need
But I feel I'm in Hell every time I breathe
Reporting live from the other side what you hear
A bunch of nonsense all in my ear
Rich man, poor man, we all gotta pay
Cause freedom ain't free, especially 'round my way

[Verse 2]
And we marvel at the state of Ottoman
Then turn around and treat Ghana like a garbage can
America's a big motherfuckin' garbageman
If you ain't know, you're part and parcel of the problem
You say no you ain't, and I say yes you is
Soon as you find out what planned obsolescence is
You say no they didn't, and I say yes they did
The definition of unnecessary-ness
Manifested
Say that we should protest just to get arrested
That goes against all my hustling ethics
A bunch of jail niggas say it's highly ineffective
Depart from Martin, connect on Malcolm X tip
Insert Baldwin to similar the separate
To me, the truth is more fulfilling than a meth hit
Or finding really fast internet to have some sex with
It's all one song short of a set list
Couple croissants shy of a continental breakfast
Or blowing out your birthday candles just to make a death wish
So absurd, word to Chief Bone Necklace
Down at the Lakota Sioux Casino
A whole culture boiled down to giving you pokeno
I go as left as a heart in the chest
Cause the Horn of Africa is now starving to death

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
An all-white Los Angeles, the dream of Mr. Chandler
Hope and pray they take Columbus Day up off the calendar
South Central an example of God's gifts
So shout to all the mothers raising babies in SPA 6
The projects of Oakland city, Detroit ghost towns
Monopolies on poverty where D-boy coke bound
It’s parts of Manila like the video for "Thriller"
But the US Embassy is reminiscent of a villa
If poverty is chocolate and privilege vanilla
Then what’s the flavor of the Sunday preacher’s pedophilia?
Cash rules everything around these niggas
As classrooms everywhere around me wither
Hither you can be Mr. Burns or Mr. Smithers
The tyrant or the slave, but nowhere in the middle
Of the extremes of America’s dream
Freud fighting Neo, Freddy Krueger refereeing, now…

[Hook]

[Outro]
Great American rap resurrect...
Lupe on the check
Westside till I die![Verse 1]
It's time to dip dive dip, you might break a hip
To the sound that's legit, I've come to make a hit
I usually bust scratches with my brother, C.L. Smooth
But, I decided to get wreck on this groove
As I provide the slide you're going on a ride
I know the weather's nice, there's no need to play the outside
Guess who's on the flyer, the man of your desire
Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth all the honey-dips admire
Beats are rough and rugged, Pete Rock is the creator
Now I'm busting raps while switching cross-faders
Making sure my sound hits from here to Grenada
Honey gave me skins, man, I told her friends I ate her
But, wait up, I save this subject for later
But, it's time to catch wreck with the creator

[Verse 2]
I'm addicted like a stoag, not into vogue
(Yo, Pete, there's a girl on the phone)
Tell her to hold cause I'm busy kickin' rhymes to the rhythm
Fortified with soul cause that's what I give 'em
Honeys form a line form a line cause I always seem to capure
Beats made of rupture, rhymes made of rapture
Far from illiterate, always seem to get a hit
If you try to step to this, don't even consider it
Skins when I want 'em, but, only when I need 'em
To set the record straight, I'll be damned if eat 'em
Call me Pete Rock, I make the girls flock
And if you want a beat like this, I got them in stock
So, flow with the flow, because you know I'm good to go
As I proceed to get wreck on your stereo
Not an imitator, just a crowd motivator
But, it's time to get wreck with the creator

Now, C.L. Smooth, cut it up like this
(scratching)

[Verse 3]
Now, I'm'a take a try and get a piece of the pie
If they give me one sec to get some wreck
Never filled with anger, a good body banger
If you try to step to this you'll get hung on my hanger
Before I say good-bye suckers gave a good try
But, point blank you just can't see this
My word is beneficial, Pete Rock is the issue
And I know you know my style is official
I might give a scratch (Yes, cousin)
Or I might kick a verse (No question)
Either one, I can't be seen, honeys call me tall and lean
And if you want to stick around, I'll show you what I mean
Not an imitator, just a crowd motivator
But, it's time to get wreck with the creator

It's time to get wreck with the creator
Get wreck with the creator
The creator

C.L. Smooth, get busy[Pete Rock]

[Rap Verse 1: C.L. Smooth]
The way I
Let it loose, for real, could only boost, the deal
The bigger the flip
The better it feel
Ladies up shakin'
Doin' they dance
Hands in the air
When Mary drop
It's nothin' but a family affair
Now once you got C.L. poppin', baby, ain't no stoppin'
It's all gravy, once you got the whole hood coppin'
With the queen on my lap
With some new paper, daddy, it's a rap

[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige]
Come on, everybody, get on up
Cause you know we gots to get it crunk
Mary J. is in the spot tonight
And I'm a make you feel alright (Make you feel alright)
Come on, baby, just party with me
Let loose and set your body free
Leave your situations at the door
So when you step inside, jump on the floor

Chorus: Mary J. Blige
Let's get it crunk up on it
Fun up on it
In this dancery
We got y'all open
Now you're floatin'
So you gots to dance for me
Don't need no hateration
Holleration

Let's get it perculatin'
While you're waitin'
Soldiers, dance for me

(Verse 2)
[Mary J. Blige] It's only gonna be about a matter of time
Before you get loose and start to
Lose your mind
Cop you a drink, go ahead and rock your ice
Cause were celebratin' No More Drama in our life

Go ahead and twist your back, and get your body bumpin'
I told you, leave your situations at the door
So grab somebody, and get your ass on the dance floor

Repeat Chorus

Bridge:
[Mary J. Blige] We, don't need, no haters
We just tryin' to love, one another
We just want y'all to have a good time

If you got beef, your problem, not mine
Leave all that BS outside
Then we gonna celebrate all night
Let's have fun tonight, no fights

[Mary J. Blige] Way up high
Making you dance all night and I
Got some real heat for ya this time
Doesn't matter if you white or black
Let's get crunk cause Mary back

[Rap Verse 2: C.L. Smooth]
Yo, yo
I'd probably boot these thoroughbreds
And bully the draw, step up in the club, and all they wanna
Start is the biddin' wars
Compared to the young
C.L
A much more ruthless, more more richer
But it's a family affair
Then I guess I'm just
That much more sicker, cigar blowin', champagne flowin'
Be easy
Like movin' units is nothin' further
That could please me
But how ya marinate my check late
With M.J.B

[Run]

Down with the king for years, about ten of 'em
Recruiting suckers, Mac and Mike, and makin' men of 'em
Tears and fears for my peers, they rippin'
You think that it is, it is, if not it isn't
Race for the border my daughter, cause beats you're bangin' out
Jeeps rockin' beats in the streets when there's time for hangin' out
Gather, or rather form a circle around a loud
Cause brothers or others could never ever rock a crowd
Is it because he's runnin' off with the mouth
Or was he really clearly tryin' to play a nigga out
Nope, shut him down, the king with a crown
Cause all you wanna be is +Diggy Down+

[Hook]

(CL Smooth)
Two years ago, a friend of mine
Asked me to say some MC rhymes
So I said this rhyme I'm about to say
The rhyme was meeca, and it went this way
Recollect a mecca mic check on the windmill skills
Mac distracts, wearing Godfather hats
It's okay to parlay to fortee better
Tell 'em my nigga made a sweater tougher than leather
Swing another Rodney King thing and i'll wreck
But just like the white one I get no respect
Money stay awake, cause them other niggas are fake
From Hollis to the Beacon, now your dumb ass is leakin'
C.L. and Run DMC so rush it
Big time way before Hammer got to touch it
Remember the faces in all types of places
Look Ma, no shoelaces
And I'm

[Hook]

[DMC]

I'm takin' the tours, I'm wreckin' the land
I keep it hardcore because it's dope man
These are the roughest toughest words I ever wrote down
Not mean for a ho like a slow jam, check it
Sucka emcees could never swing with D
Because of all the things that I bring with me
Only G-O-D could be a king to me
And if the G-O-D be in me, then the king I be
The microphone is granted when it's handed to me
I was planted on this planet and I plan to emcee
The emcee fiends only seem to agree
That I rock all the world and the society
I rages on the stages with a tune of verse
I get praises from these pages to the universe
My voice is raw, my lyrics is law
I keep it hardcore like you never saw

[Hook]

[Pete Rock]
I'm the man you see, in the place to be
I went to John Jay University
And since kindergarten I acquired the knowledge
And after twelve grade I went straight to college
Down with the kings on the mic, a full swinger
The P to the R, not an R&B singer
The R to the U-N-D-MC'n
The fly human beings, tonight I hold the key and
Flowin' with the funk track, here to soul brother black
Pick up the bass, better yet leave a space
So let me put my big black twinkie on in to the early mornin'
Had skins yawning'
Mecca? (yo) you want the mecca? (yo)
I'll make a funky beat so we can blow, check it out
Pete Rock's the beat knock, put you in a headlock
And now all the outty out flock is down with the king[Verse 1: C.L. Smooth]
C.L. is that living legend
Life is like the number 7
I had to walk through hell just to get to heaven
My weapons a microphone laced with a hot track
Knock it back, this is real hip hop, jack
Coming straight out the New Guiena, My flow is so gritty
Controlling the whole city, the hood is so with me
In fact I'm God-like, put me in the spotlight
Trunk tight, if it ain't rough it ain't right so
Let me do the damn thing, I'm putting it down king
You doubt the kid, bring every song they wanna sing
But son, your sleeping on me, this is why I keep it on me
Believe in fairy tales, this here's the true story
I'm world wide with it, why I 'm so fly with it
The soul brother, number one, wait til I get it
With Nujabes now, turntables keep spinning
Love the way I perform thats why I stay winning

[Verse 2: C.L. Smooth]
How I stay caked up, despite the break up
Fans miss my old group, but see me in the new coup
Lacing up my new joints and measure my 5 point
You study in detail, this is all C.L. Smooth
So hard with it daddy, so nice with it baby
Like school yard pay me, its really all gravy though
No hard feelings, built to keep it moving
Never asked what you were doing, just keep something brewing
Let it bang, let it pop, like you call that copping
I'm going straight to the top
See me do it for the TV, Here stands the MC
Back then it made you, now its gonna make me
Lately, see I'm living life so good
Step my game up, got my street fam out the hood
Let me climb up the charts now, all black art now
Nuja play the flute, while your boy get loot, Uh!

[Verse 3: C.L. Smooth]
You take my space, and put it to my face
Solidify my place, in raps with the paper chase
Who got better taste in women and good living
I'm feeling the whole boom and none of you lames do it
I get spread through it, it's nothing to me, homie
You know my name ring bells, yeah they all know me
Hold down the fort, here to put it in port
They hound CL Smooth to get the street taught
The ghettos we walk, rapper's insecurity
You know I'm soon to be the poster child for unity
They wanna be me, thats all on my CD
A real O.G. living it fast and free
Let me mold you, show you how I spit lyrics
Know all the words and dont speak a lick of English
I stay global with it, this is why I get it on
It's the top dog, return of the mecca don[Verse 1: C.L. Smooth]
You're beautiful, the way you wear that, share that
Have many ladies, but nothing can compare to that smile
That style that drives men wild
That ring could have Big Daddy walkin' down the isle
Proper you a show stopper, girl endure dropper
I can see me leavin' Suze and bring it home to mama
What you lookin at is pure bred stallion
I'm slayin' it you really care to know whose jay in it
Oh how lucky are we catch you comin' out the shower
And I'm right there to wipe down your body
Spread that scented lotion all around your curves
Anything you want, all she deserves
Baby calm your nerves make this work
Only thing in life you fear is being hurt
Here to protect thought otherwise
I'm here to correct you can trust me

[Verse 2: C.L. Smooth]
You and I now that's a hot couple
When it's off in the same club
Now you askin' for nothing but trouble
Watch you jumpin' at the Red Labels
Got my woman and her girlfriends dancin' on the tables
Shut down the joint, me I'm just laidback and all
Surrounded by the gangsters puffin' on the cigar
Badder chick in the world keep niggas cranked
Yes the hottest chick on the planet keep a nigga ranked
The question is can you top that homie
You can probably pull something close but stop that homie
Not even, could have that even if I stopped breathin'
Don't hope for that my ghost will be pokin' it still
Read my will my boys get it all no gimmicks
But I'm here to let you know my jump off is off limits
Life and love get made for a thug
Once I settled in you made me a gentleman

[Verse 3: C.L. Smooth]
Tot game is crazy diamonds on stilettos
Travel through these ghettos drop to top
Let 'em see what I'm workin' with came to win
How the don keeps the fun to blow in the wind
World war is magnetic that attracts loot
She look Wall Street briefcase, pen strife suit
The hair rub in a bun, spectacles on her nose
Any deal she makes, my business grows
They say a woman's never satisfied
Till she have me to fill it to her heart's content
It's my blessing, God gave you to me
And words can't describe, what you do for me
Your C.L. is, love me or love me not
But no-one can match this chemistry we got
Why they all fall, you C.L.'s wife
Cause all we got is eachother a bond for life[Verse 1: C.L. Smooth]
I make it move like I wanna move with them horns
Let 'em play with them strings
While I spit the life of kings
Put a could in it
Stood with it, we at it
Dudes that was meant to have it
Fans wanna reach out and grab it
I'm just an ordinary man
With an un-ordinary lifestyle
Seen early, I would live as a child
I was conceived a mistake
But through God was really all it take for me to be born
And make the earth shake
This was raised from the bottom
So before them plain cones got 'em
Soak up the four square miles to pop 'em
It's me in the flesh
Here to put the rumours to rest
And let you celebrate hip hop's best
From the womb to the tomb
Hit the game real soon
With a tune that's gonn' take sun
Straight to the moon
Taddau
See it's my turn now
All competitors bow
All you sayin' is "WOW"

[Hook]
All I know
It's the way it gotta go
And everything you take to hold me down
All I see
It's the way it gotta be
If you came to see me hit the town
This is my vibe
The way I survive
And peoples can't play me out of bounds
Here's my point
On the Jazzy Jeff joint
That's why C.L. can wear the crown

[Verse 2: C.L. Smooth]
When you think about the pedigree
I own the whole catalog
All I'm sayin' is
Don't sleep on me dawg
I really waked them streets there
Schooled them young wolves
C.L. will slay anything in his way
Okay it's all about the aura I project
That ultimate connect
And how you see me as a man of respect, right
So it's like a mutual agreement
All your feed is in the seamon
Learn the rules
Let you earn your pay sure
Knows of when you think of what it cost me
And how the world forced me to kill 'em softly baby
How the music sound from the basement
And how the world blessed me
Who let you see the fame don't impress me, dig it
Why it's cut from a different cloth
Blood it, set it off
Keep a real nice piece of the love easy
Anytime you can hold ya head
Then you can hold some bread
And relate to what C.L. said
Yes....

[Hook]

[Verse 3: C.L. Smooth]
It's Jazzy Jeff on the turntables
C.L. on the M-I-C
Philly on up to the N.Y.C
And breakdances, God
Tags in the trainyard
Wild style fat laced
Thugs locked up
From a 1980's case
Goons with them grown kids
Used to them long bids
Meet you on the dance floor
Slash the visit then
A lot from the rep to
And seein' it all makes sense
If I'm the king
Then that should make you the fresh prince
Send for the driver
You lookin' at the real soul survivor
Like my man J. Period
Mix tape
The man on fire
Featuring the guested Jeff host
You marvel at the up close and personal
Meetin' other minds
You should read the signs
This is what reclines
The thoughts in my lazy boy
Fit like a hand and glove
Through the city of brotherly love

[Hook][ Pete Rock ]
Here we go
One time to the head
Somethin like this

[ VERSE 1: C.L. Smooth ]
Make way for the C.L. wrath on phonograph
Knowin the half, cozy like a bubblebath
Never said to be strange when I break and rearrange
A weak sap that's small as chump change
In the Poconos playin dominos
Foes who rose caught a broken nose
'Who's the Boss?' Not Tony Danza
Apart so Lorne Greene on 'Bonanza'
'Unforgettable' as Nat King Cole
Rough like a rodeo, hangin like a scarecrow
I get busynism, pump the realism
And just for the teacher or tutor I quiz em
Bonafied to eat you like Frito Lays
You can't faze and roll like the craze
Cultivate the mind, train it to teach
To write a book like Edward ??Shaw Keats??
Motivate the crowd aloud to get a response
Catch the mood of ambiance
No Ringling Brothers, Barnum & Bailey
???, played like a damn ukulele
Ahead of the class, so I break ya like glass
Have ya open like a surgery bypass
Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth without a doubt
That's why we're all souled out

[ Pete Rock ]
Yeah (8X)

[ VERSE 2: C.L. Smooth ]
C.L.'ll get wreck in a millimeter sec
Kirk out, all hands on deck
Pick up the pen again, perp like ??Sanchor??
We're goin Warp Speed, raise the anchor
Rock a party so fly it's a sin
You bang on the door but you can't come in
So get a ???? like ??Rolo?? tomorrow
And if he turn snake just cut him like an avocado
Share the bread and wine like the Passover
Better luck than a four-leaf clover
C.L. Smooth'll kick a groove to a nation
Start from Genesis, end at Revelations
The tune immune and tap the fannies
Of Miss America and pick flavor panties
The man no type of woman avoids
Grab a microphone, blow it up like steroids
Enticin like lingerie
Had to lay Connie May just the other day
Explore like Magellan, shake like a gelatine
Can't be a felon, more seeds than a watermelon
When I raise like cattle for the battle
C.L. is prime time, go buy a raffle
A ticket when I kick it, clever like an ????
Masses and classes crisp and clear
I rock em, sock em ????
Pete Rock around the clock catchin wreck on the block
Playin more vocals than a Milli Vanilli
Shoot the gift with a spliff, but cousin, pass the philly
And let me get Brand Nubian, cold shake your booty and
Large like a ?????
Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth without a doubt
That's why we're all souled out

[ VERSE 3: C.L. Smooth ]
Smooth like Fabian, hot as the Arabian
Some will try but can't solve the equation
Take em down to the city where the boys act illy
And the girls look pretty like a philly
Rock the nurses, a quick couple of verses
No one curses, a king being the merciless
Read the resume first and I bet em
Paralyzin, hard to trace like venom
????? diluted ????? strictly be chillin
To play a better show on screen than Jack Nicholson
Ed Lovett International cuts my hair
A pioneer run fear here to Delaware
I got a 'Monie in the middle' for a playmate
A Spinderella/Salt-n-Pepa lover that's great
The unchained melody, sing it like Sarah Vaughn
Your ass is grass cause I can mow the lawn
Not a tricky-dickey lover that's picky
But hard nitty-gritty when things get sticky
I wanna hold a hump back like a whale
But you're frail and don't weigh much on a scale
The Tango & Cash, dynamic duo
Figure the one done so you know
Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth without a doubt
That's why we're all souled out[Intro: Children singing] (5x)
"Two four six eight, who do you appreciate"

[Verse 1: C.L. Smooth]
First of all, you better count your blessings
Cause when you got C.L. now you got bad boy, your connections
In return, while we live and we learn, then you know what it is
To only build a bigger future for the kids
In peace, in war, lets take it to the floor
Every time we take two steps, the crowd takes four
Lay the heat, how I come to the street, how I cut through the beef
Let me handle that, that's why you make me chief
It's packed, what they want in this here
Can we weather the storm, six minutes, C.L. Smooth you're on
All the anger and the fear, was in the dressing room prayer
That we came out to light it up and put it in the air
That's real, so holler back at ya boy, step aside Leroy
To all my ladies, who want tickets, enjoy, cause
I spit it and you gotta get with it and you'll never forget it
Yes, I want the best out, count 'em all

[Hook]
"Two four six eight, who do you appreciate"
To the fans and to all my people that supported us
"Two four six eight, who do you appreciate"
To the mama and the daddy and everything they taught us
"Two four six eight, who do you appreciate"
Tell them kids they gotta stay in school or ride with us
"Two four six eight, who do you appreciate"
When it all goes down, baby, All We Got Is Us

[Verse 2: C.L. Smooth]
Tell 'em this is history in the making, avoiding disasters
This run is for the green jacket, I fit, the masters
My crew havin' business, save, put it in through my office
The security is tight and the secretary is gorgeous
That's official, me and Pete in the lab, that's what they want
Pushin' that real hip hop, up to the front
The game's been good to me, preserved my youth
Not only did it capture my goals, it told me the truth
Look out my hustle, made a living, paid and driven
See why they tour around the world came to save us from prison
It's great, I'd rather love than hate
You think it fell out the sky, I'm here to tell you, why believe in faith
Hard work, payin' of and them wishes comin' true
Bolt open and you out to lunch, and left us two
Now you know we can't let that pass to get that cash
We in the big numbers, count 'em all

[Hook]

[Verse 3: C.L. Smooth]
Why my Uncle Doc left me everything when he died, and
When pop passed, two weeks later I cried, and
When great grandma left it all went crazy now
All I had left was grandma Pam, that's my baby
Can't talk bad about me, she'd tell 'em, why we need to give her
All her roses while she could smell 'em
I live this moment used to stay how we were
How my mother came to her in a dream and told her
Corey will come out of this deep dark depression, stand by me
Give my insight a resurrection and heal me
And feel me, what you got is to love, got a thing
This little woman who brought back the thug, let's grind
Ghetto's Of The Mind while I'm in my prime
I left, so y'all can catch up, I'm ahead of my time
Your legacy and that lazy boy say it ain't fear
My next generation triple my digits, add 'em up like

[Hook][Produced by Simonsayz and B Sides; Additional production by Lupe Fiasco and Chill]

[Verse 1]
First off, say "Peace" to Pine Ridge
Shame at all the damage that the white man wine did
Ghost Dance, Trail of Tears, five million beers a year
And all that other crime did
More peace to the teachers of blind kids
To rebels in small cells keeping their mind big
Say everything's hostile
Suicide bombers and prosperity gospels, emaciated models
With cocaine and blood pouring out their nostrils, they got to
Just to stay awake on the catwalk of life where everybody watch you
Straight hair, high heels and a handbag
Crucifixes, racism and a land grab
Katrina, FEMA trailers, human body sandbags
A peace sign and a pants sag
A money toss cause a nine stripper mad dash
A friend request following a hash tag
Now everybody want it like the last laugh
A Michael Jackson jacket or a Daft mask
Purple Jordans or the mixed girl in your math class
Stable is when the Ba'ath had Baghdad
But corporate jets really had to have that gas bad
War and they hope they all fall from the ratatat
Cause that's just more dinosaur for the Cadillac

[Hook]
Live from the other side what you see
A bunch of nonsense on my TV
Heaven on Earth is what I need
But I feel I'm in Hell every time I breathe
Reporting live from the other side what you hear
A bunch of nonsense all in my ear
Rich man, poor man, we all gotta pay
Cause freedom ain't free, especially 'round my way

[Verse 2]
And we marvel at the state of Ottoman
Then turn around and treat Ghana like a garbage can
America's a big motherfuckin' garbageman
If you ain't know, you're part and parcel of the problem
You say no you ain't, and I say yes you is
Soon as you find out what planned obsolescence is
You say no they didn't, and I say yes they did
The definition of unnecessary-ness
Manifested
Say that we should protest just to get arrested
That goes against all my hustling ethics
A bunch of jail niggas say it's highly ineffective
Depart from Martin, connect on Malcolm X tip
Insert Baldwin to similar the separate
To me, the truth is more fulfilling than a meth hit
Or finding really fast internet to have some sex with
It's all one song short of a set list
Couple croissants shy of a continental breakfast
Or blowing out your birthday candles just to make a death wish
So absurd, word to Chief Bone Necklace
Down at the Lakota Sioux Casino
A whole culture boiled down to giving you pokeno
I go as left as a heart in the chest
Cause the Horn of Africa is now starving to death

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
An all-white Los Angeles, the dream of Mr. Chandler
Hope and pray they take Columbus Day up off the calendar
South Central an example of God's gifts
So shout to all the mothers raising babies in SPA 6
The projects of Oakland city, Detroit ghost towns
Monopolies on poverty where D-boy coke bound
It’s parts of Manila like the video for "Thriller"
But the US Embassy is reminiscent of a villa
If poverty is chocolate and privilege vanilla
Then what’s the flavor of the Sunday preacher’s pedophilia?
Cash rules everything around these niggas
As classrooms everywhere around me wither
Hither you can be Mr. Burns or Mr. Smithers
The tyrant or the slave, but nowhere in the middle
Of the extremes of America’s dream
Freud fighting Neo, Freddy Krueger refereeing, now…

[Hook]

[Outro]
Great American rap resurrect...
Lupe on the check
Westside till I die!A point of clarification in the Pete Rock & CL Smooth "True to the Game" article [by Louis Romain, August '92]. Referring to the quote "If LL takes his hat off, he's over..." I did not intend to imply that LL Cool J fell off, is wack, etc., but rather to note that he uses a specific gimmick as an artist (case in points: Humpty's nose). I grew up with LL being one of my favorite rappers and he was an inspiration for me to do what I do today

CL Smooth
Mt. Vernon, NY[Produced by Pete Rock]

[Verse 1: CL Smooth]
Introducing C.L. then face defeats
Then I remind you of third street when it was sweet
See'd us move on and grow to another plateau with me and...
Havin that dough
In the last days when critical times are left
To deal with my grand daddy's endeavors
Whut corrected my errors the first shot came in 91
E.P. done my struggle
To label this untouchable foundation due in 92, top ten review
Respect new when that flew, They Reminisce Over You
Skirt chasin what they rate me in this whole rap affair
But when it really comes down to it who cares
Like the tortoise and the hare ya know the race I run
But ya losin all the nights, ya let the rabbit get the gun
Number one wit a bullet and my pit name, black
Is the best who ever did it on a Pete Rock track

[Hook x2: Pete Rock]
Ayo two cool cats who reclaim the name
Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth in this here rap game
But the good news is that there is a crew
Not 5 not 4 not 3 (Just two!)

[Verse 2: Pete Rock]
In the beginning, let it be like the record spinning
As a child I stack 45's in a pile blow the dust off
Put it on before I can walk
Play static on my pop dukes automatic
I knew I wasn't average music in my bloodstream
My pops watch his son live his dream
Now as time flew, the original classy rock crew
Shine through on streets and avenues
The next chapter you read it MC Shan said it
Gotta give the man behind wheels credit
Yes yes y'all, BLS and Marley Marl
The Rap Attack put my talents on the map
Now it's Pete Rock for days in Tha Basement
As I amaze watch me blow in 98 ways
I specialize in rap, DJ and produce
With more hot tracks then Carlos DeJesus

Hook x2

[Verse 3: CL Smooth]
What it look like, ain't nothin changed but the weather
Still riding with C.D.'s and leather, roll fives and better
For all that's folded in ya pocket, how long it take
To re-up and clock it, drop and make a profit
And lay my position with you that we know what to do
And not to do, stop this fighting each other
God knowledge ya wiz, that you know who the enemy is, furthermore
Don't hide it divide it then X ya squares
To keep them other cats folded like beach chairs
Got an eye on that street aristocrat
Let C.L. show ya where the strengths at
Turn it up right here or just call the cop
Cuz we on it like this to the last stop
The next Humphrey Bogart, mastering art
Like a jeweler wit a diamond cutter, taking em apart
Don't start what ya can't finish
When ya bubble wit skills that never diminish
Ya best team against mine is a light scrimmage
So play like Popeye and eat spinach

Hook x2[Intro: CL Smooth]
"So bring it down"
Bust it off
"So bring it down"
Uh lick shot one time for the Mecca don
"So bring it down"
And the Soul Brother #1
"So bring it down"
Job is done with the YG'z Menace II Society
"So bring it down"
Feel the real steel, the hot metal
"So bring it down"
"So bring it down"

[Verse 1: CL Smooth]
It's the kill or be killed, rugged skill, that's often
And land your fuckin asses in a coffin, what
You see cold steel, coz niggas wanna mill'
Like Shaquille, O' Neal
Bullets are real, cock it back and then I peel off
Fuck the kamikaze Mecca is on the shotty hottie
The cops are runnin white chalk around your dead body
Abandon ship, niggas are ready to flip and bag a punk
They can't fight next night, twist a lism by your gravesight

[Verse 2: Kenny]
Over, yes you over, six feet under
You sleep, I'm outta these, you're diseased
A reason for the treason, hunting season
Not for rabbit
I deals for niggas drinkin' beers loungin' off block
Till the early morn', word is bond, another brother gone
Caught up in bullshit, quick talkin with nines and banana clips
For million with bloodshed, the color red, two to the fuckin head
Man you're dead, Death Becomes You

[Hook][8X]
"So listen" - Slick Rick
"So bring it down"

[Verse 3: CL Smooth]
Infrareds locked on ya heads here come the feds
Freeze now when I squeeze hot metal breeze
Right through your arteries to bring you to your knees
I think he's dyin' black
I got the track to send you silly ass niggas back
Snatch ya ho stab ya pimp and watch him limp away
I fiend Luchi till I'm fucked up old and gray
Hey dog I send you to the morgue
I'm from the Vernon ville blood spills shells drop
Because I gotta kill

[Verse 4: Kenny]
When ya heard it go pop-pop
My Glock hit a nigga's knot
Cause I'm one of the hard akh's smokin' motherfuckers like crack rocks huh
So back up, be ghost when I keep my toast Murder She Wrote yo
Fully equipped with this death blow, flippin'
Because I'm on the level like the rebel crazy bodies and tombstones
Straight to the devil, nigga lay in ya bedspread
Because ya through from evil that men do
Shifty nigga Death Becomes You

[Hook][8X]
"So listen"
"So bring it down"

"So listen to what we say because this type o' shit it happens everyday"

[Verse 5: Cl Smooth]
No resurrection with protection slay cut up in the blender
Just like Mohammed blowin' up the World Trade Center
The hellraisin' burner blazin' stressin' major caution
See the Mecca Don showin' a tongue like Jordan
Anything you cherish I perish, I'm here to roll
And now you punks are pickin' lead out ya asshole
Gun smoke when the hood is broke and need the riches
Cause all this nigga want is more dough and more bitches

[Verse 6: Pete Rock]
Buck-buck-buck-buck rat-tat-tat I'm on a mission nigga
I shoots to kill when I pull the motherfucking trigger
I'm sick in the head I'm crazy I'm fuckin' wild
I swear to God I'm coming straight from the penile
I'm Menace like Dennis so don't try to play me close
I wave my gun in the air yo I don't fuckin' care
It's Pete Rock on the mic check one, two
I got the Glock nigga, Death Becomes You

[Outro]
"So listen"
"So bring it down"
"So listen to what we say because this type o' shit it happens everyday"
"So bring it down" "So listen" etc[Intro (Spoken): Heavy D]
This one definitely goes out on the censorship tip, so everybody sit back, relax and have a champagne sip
We're gonna teach these people out there that we can say what we want to say, the right way
You know what I'm saying? So what we're gonna do is kick back, swing a little funky beat by my man DJ Pete Rock, producer extraordinaire. Yo Pete Rock! Make it clear

[Verse 1: Heavy D]
I can flex, bend, lend a pen to a friend
Keep a party pimping from now till then
I don't have to swear, curse or juggle
Lyrics in a verse to make a party bubble
So mister censorship, tell me what's your problem?
There's girlies on the corner, if wifey can't solve them
How does she say it? I'm curious, G
Does she say "honey love me" or "baby baby fffffun me?"
Anyway, we'll say what we want to say
Play how we want to play, feels good that way
So G. Rap, huh, it's time to kick a verse
Do your man a favor, and don't curse

[Verse 2: Kool G. Rap]
You're telling me don't curse on my verse
I did it worse, first I put a curse on every verse
I kinda got outrageous
Check it, even made a record how I'm doing all the B-I-T-C-H'es
Ducks, it wasn't for the bucks
Every word that you heard is 'cuz I didn't give a f-- aww shucks!
Hey yo, I almost forgot
The curse is a plot but it's getting kind of hot
So I'mma let profanity retire
Hey, but if worse comes to worse I'll curse you out like Richard Pryor
So Grand Puba, kick a verse
But do your man a favor, and don't curse

[Verse 3: Grand Puba]
I won't curse. I'll take a famous curse word and just say "kcuf"
Kcuf flipped around the other way means, huh?
Boy, when I do it, see I can't get stuck
Jump on the mic, then I earn a quick buck
Buck meaning loot, then I grab some boots and step with my troops
For those who can't follow and got stuck
Kcuf flipped the other way means . . . [coughing]
Is this a curse? I freaked a nurse in a hearse
But I made sure I had my hat first
(C.L. Smooth) It's time to kick a verse
God-Cypher-Divine, we can't curse

[Verse 4: C.L. Smooth]
Go ahead, ask me will I kick a curse in a verse? I'll say "nope"
Grab you by your hair, wash your mouth out with soap
Thinking to be the last one with the bad lingo
Scooping on the skins in the church playing Bingo
Sounds of the Mecca don, fresh from the tailor
Because they made a movie when he cussed like a sailor
Better yet dialect dirty like a subway
Freak a funky loop and I make it go the other way
In a vocabulary scrimmage
But cursing in my village ain't good for my image
So Big Daddy, you know it's time to kick a verse
But do your man a favor: don't curse

[Verse 5: Big Daddy Kane]
Uhh, the smooth rap inventor that enter
Parental discretion's not advised so there's no need to censor
Kids want to peep it, but you want to beep it, what?
I feel like slapping that sticker on your (Chill, chill, say butt!)
I'm too magical, rhymes are too tragical
For any source to stop Kane from getting capital
If I thought sticking me was dissing me, man, don't you know that this would be
Worse than Stephen King's Misery?
So clean all profanity, still and yet all the man'll be
Rocking any microphone you're handing me
So Heavy D, I'm about to disperse
Kick another verse, and don't forget not to curse!

[Interlude (Spoken): Heavy D]
Hey yo Big Daddy, check this out. I'm about to do some old sly, slick, smooth on the trick tip stuff
I'm gonna bring my little cousin, the producer of this joint, his name is DJ Pete Rock, definitely part of one of the family, you know what I'm saying, G?
He's about to flex on this here mic and get busy like his big cousin, you know what I'm saying? Check it
Pete Rock, kick a verse but don't curse!

[Verse 6: Pete Rock]
God bless, but I can't mess
Around with the curses, so I'mma kick verses
Or a verse, Soul Brother number 1 here to kick facts
Smoke the microphone and produce crazy tracks
Yo I'm a bad bro, let's start the flow
I'mma kick rhymes till it's time for me to go
I can't curse 'cuz Heavy D said so
Now I'mma get back to the subject, get wreck
If you think I'm bluffing just check
With the crew, Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth, very down to earth
And we didn't have to curse

[Interlude (Spoken): Q-Tip]
Yeah man, the Abstract Poet, Q-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest here to wreck!
You know what I'm saying, got my man Pete Rock and my man D in the house
And we're definitely chilling on the lifted tip
So bust the spit out

[Verse 7: Q-Tip]
Flim-flam-flim, lick my big black stuff
Must I kick a curse to be rough enough?
You can put the sticker where the sun don't shine
So back off and let me get mine!
Visions in my head when it's dealing with hits
If I have four girls, then I lick eight [its]
Wait--don't want to hear no drama
Cause the bum-diddly-Hev is a fave of my mama's
So I blew out and get mad lifted
Don't have to say [kcuf] to show that I'm gifted
God bless me 'cuz I reached my twenty-first
Hev D! Don't drop a curse

[Verse 8: Heavy D]
Peace, peace. Peace to the preacher
I'm talking about a verse without a curse, that's how I reach ya
I can rock a party without a swear or a harsh verb
Backwards, no curse words Heavy D prefers
So swing, swing to the silky clean rhythm
Before I say goodbye let me tell you how I hit 'em:
C.L., Pete Rock, G. Rap, Maxwell
Big Daddy, Q-Tip and, uh, me as well
Time to say peace, thank Pete for the beats
This funky beat was made for the streets
Notice how clean that we kept every verse
But if worse came to worse (we'd have all said a curse!)

[Outro]
Free Slick Rick! [repeated to fade-out][Hook]

[Run]

Down with the king for years, about ten of 'em
Recruiting suckers, Mac and Mike, and makin' men of 'em
Tears and fears for my peers, they rippin'
You think that it is, it is, if not it isn't
Race for the border my daughter, cause beats you're bangin' out
Jeeps rockin' beats in the streets when there's time for hangin' out
Gather, or rather form a circle around a loud
Cause brothers or others could never ever rock a crowd
Is it because he's runnin' off with the mouth
Or was he really clearly tryin' to play a nigga out
Nope, shut him down, the king with a crown
Cause all you wanna be is +Diggy Down+

[Hook]

(CL Smooth)
Two years ago, a friend of mine
Asked me to say some MC rhymes
So I said this rhyme I'm about to say
The rhyme was meeca, and it went this way
Recollect a mecca mic check on the windmill skills
Mac distracts, wearing Godfather hats
It's okay to parlay to fortee better
Tell 'em my nigga made a sweater tougher than leather
Swing another Rodney King thing and i'll wreck
But just like the white one I get no respect
Money stay awake, cause them other niggas are fake
From Hollis to the Beacon, now your dumb ass is leakin'
C.L. and Run DMC so rush it
Big time way before Hammer got to touch it
Remember the faces in all types of places
Look Ma, no shoelaces
And I'm

[Hook]

[DMC]

I'm takin' the tours, I'm wreckin' the land
I keep it hardcore because it's dope man
These are the roughest toughest words I ever wrote down
Not mean for a ho like a slow jam, check it
Sucka emcees could never swing with D
Because of all the things that I bring with me
Only G-O-D could be a king to me
And if the G-O-D be in me, then the king I be
The microphone is granted when it's handed to me
I was planted on this planet and I plan to emcee
The emcee fiends only seem to agree
That I rock all the world and the society
I rages on the stages with a tune of verse
I get praises from these pages to the universe
My voice is raw, my lyrics is law
I keep it hardcore like you never saw

[Hook]

[Pete Rock]
I'm the man you see, in the place to be
I went to John Jay University
And since kindergarten I acquired the knowledge
And after twelve grade I went straight to college
Down with the kings on the mic, a full swinger
The P to the R, not an R&B singer
The R to the U-N-D-MC'n
The fly human beings, tonight I hold the key and
Flowin' with the funk track, here to soul brother black
Pick up the bass, better yet leave a space
So let me put my big black twinkie on in to the early mornin'
Had skins yawning'
Mecca? (yo) you want the mecca? (yo)
I'll make a funky beat so we can blow, check it out
Pete Rock's the beat knock, put you in a headlock
And now all the outty out flock is down with the king[Intro: Talib Kweli]
It's Talib Kweli in the place to be Brooklyn
Most definitely yaknowhatImsayin Mount Vernon
And Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth (true) the brothers who brought ya
Escapism, Return Of The Mecca, Straighten It Out, The Creators
Yeah right about now we about to make history

[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
The track make you nod like smack through the needle
Niggas don't sell crack is they evil
America's build on the backs of my people
Cats say they packin' the heat but they actin' like Chino
Cause when it's time to bounce it back they fall back in the fetal
I went from crashin' the beat in the passenger seat
Drivin' like many straight trees don't even mix coke with the henney
Flow with so many styles ladies open all night like Denis
24 hours party people soakin' in the Remy and Cris'
The video is directed by Benny and Chris
Treat a pager like a website with plenty of hits
I tell 'em this: you gotta be at least a dime for a piece of mind
I deal with porters and keys just like the leachious mind
I like mature girls just now reachin' they prime
Know how to conversate to the man and don't eat no swine
If you ready to roll than we can rock shit
My niggas so cold we hot

[Hook: C.L. Smooth]
Pete Rock murderville keep the joint on smash
See the don come through enough bray that cash
Talib Kweli he can speak to the mass
Why the great minds think alike cause we keepin' it fly
See we keepin' it fly till the day I die, and you can't deny
Son we keepin' it fly how we keepin' this fly
Better master your eye cause we keepin' it fly
Bring it back to life

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
Psychedelic we sell it and niggas jealous fellows
Go get your hate up get your weight up I'm tellin' you straight up
You need to turn that frown upside down you use less muscles
The smile is easier than it sound, it's true
Lookin' all crooked I be tellin' these dudes
They should Straighten It Out on a Pete Rock track like C.L. Smooth
See we livin' in the Matrix way before the movie
Kids fiend before the camera screaming; just shoot me
Now they scream a million miles away from the sun
But you still feel the heat when we packed us the way of the gun
Like tape digs raise kids to escape the slave ships
Instead they wanna pump weights not the state
Better exercise take from work the rest get left inside
And whips chicks and kicks money we specialize
I be the respirator so hip hop is kept alive
So many niggas buggin' me I need a fuckin' pesticide

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]
You put light back to life cause these rappers ain't actin' right
Thinkin' they cut like Mack the knife, rap the fight
Battle right through the afterlife
Cause when you die make you look way past the life
And high sight I drop the type of rhyme
To give the blind sight, sparkle a shine bright like lemonlime
Sprite up in the limelight, yeah
As we still at the track you feel it when the chorus tack
You deal it twist a cap back with a skillet official would kill it
This is fake the way we sill it as the great Pete Rock and Kweli
Got Pete to make you chicks knees knock to Pete Rock my life
It's the soundtrack other niggas sound wack
Like white kids tryin' to sound black
I spit on mics wet up the essence where L drowned at
This Guerilla Monsoon Rap first comb rap
Soon rap come through a crossroads, and all these lost souls
Will stand out with stress signals like morse code

[Hook]Some live the good life loungin' by the pool
Catching a suntan and everything's cool
Male or female, you want to be set
In the big mansion drinking Moet
You read the Wall Street Journal
Later for the comic
Far from dumb because you practice logic
You lived poor in the ghetto
Never had the money easily
But, you found the remedy
So, you, your girl, and your kids can have a better opportunity
And teach them all about unity
Cuiltivate in the brains the word of Allah the master
And they go far
But, you still go visit your old stomping ground
Indeed to help another that's down
A tough situation cuts like a knife
In search of the good life

From the church, the home, on down to the prison
People want to know how is he and she living
Does he work?
Do you wonder if his life will bloom?
Is the girl going to have the kid anytime soon?
How's the mother?
Do they ever go visit the brother?
What about the dad?
I heard he drinks undercover
Some are still shooting up, another on crack
Just the other day trooper got sent back
What type of life do you lead?
Tell me
Cause you can be anything you want to be
Some will strive for the good life in any case
The mind is a terrible thing to waste
On drugs, violence, and hatred of another color
Hear me now, brother
All around the world the husband and wife
Work night and day in search of the good life

The G double O-D L-I-F-E
Living in luxury
Care free
Period
No time to waste
We catch ours all day
We work instead of play
I B-U-I-L-D inside me
Knowledge and quickly you vacate the city
From a paranoid mental delusion
Plain and simple
I won't cause confusion
Yo, that's your fault
Stop the somersault
Cause I put the bad like mo to a halt
My destiny I define is heavenly
So, Fort Knox, open sesame
Light shines and the birds keep singing
As I still cling to my positive upbringing
With the need to succeed, right?
On a natural high
The good life(Get on up)

Yo
From the intro
I flow
3 in a row
Buildin like a Lego
Stacks upon stacks
It attacks the wax
Scrub it like Ajax
Relievin as a X-Lax
The night cap of rap
Here to make another hit
To undercover, smudder
Word to mother
Pump it for the playground
World renowned
Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth is in town
I design a logical line
A mastermind, so recline
And listen to what's mine
I'm untouchable, lovable
Some try to imitate, but you can't make a double of
Me, the capital C, capital L, capital S
M-double o-t-h - yes
A pro
So you know
You gotta go with the flow

[ VERSE 2: C.L. Smooth ]
Smooth as ya ever gonna get to hear
Crisp and clear
So step to the rear
And make room for daddy
Bigger than a Caddy
To move a crowd? Hm, gladly
It's all done with ease
Past MC's
And all they feel is a breeze
The technician
With the first division
Like a surgical incision
Deeper envision
My flow the naked eye can't stare
But only hear
Another poet like Shakespeare
C.L. the swinger, ringer, clinger
And oh yes, you know, another hum dinger
Wreckin any studio, love to make cash
So kick it like judo
Big like a sumo
Rhymes like a pro
So you know
Like a flute I blow
And go with the flow

[ VERSE 3 ]
I rock the microphone
But you probably know to hype the show
I gotta go with the flow
And take it to another degree
That many people wanna see
But above elementary
I made lyrical
Any kind of material
More than minimal
For any individual
That I send
To reach the end
And just like Clark Gable, it's 'gone with the wind'
And take flight
Through the night
Like a meteor, right insight
To shine like a bright light
You gotta tip-toe
From the get-go
Live in stereo, rhymes gotta flip, so
Pete Rock can move your butt
And cut the strut
( *scratching* ) Yeah what?
Just like a pro
So you know
I'm ready and set
To go with the flowAlbum:  Mecca and the Soul Brother


* - this song has no title on the album

(Grap)
I am the one they call the G, the R, the A, the P and
I didn't write this, it's coming off the top of the dome
So what you wanna do and whatcha wanna go home
And tell your mama that I'm one wit all the mad drama
Yes I was causing the movies on 1 East 25th Street
I crossover, honey dips knew it was Harlem wheat
I was flowing on the place to be
Is being the capital rapper, the G-R-A-P
In the place to be wit my man Pete Rock and CL Smooth
Pass the bust a groove and the people begin to move
And get on the dancefloor
Got to move the funk you stinking little hores
And all the hoods and all the punks and all the suckers
Wit this shit I got stupid muthafukas
On my dick, what the fuk, I rock the mic so quick
Wit Adofo in the place to be
And my man Ross is right in back of me
Rob O, good to go
I've gots the F-L-O-W and that spells flow
Wit Chris Champ, oh what's up I'm bout to get amp
On top of the mic and I'm a set an exam -ple
Girls I pull, I got the honey dip, so what's up, my tank is full
Of sperm, I ready to bust a nut
What's up Pete Rock, come get on the cut
Rock to the beat, get wreck on the regular
Listen to me because I cause mass hysteria
Peace[Verse 1: C.L. Smooth]
You're beautiful, the way you wear that, share that
Have many ladies, but nothing can compare to that smile
That style that drives men wild
That ring could have Big Daddy walkin' down the isle
Proper you a show stopper, girl endure dropper
I can see me leavin' Suze and bring it home to mama
What you lookin at is pure bred stallion
I'm slayin' it you really care to know whose jay in it
Oh how lucky are we catch you comin' out the shower
And I'm right there to wipe down your body
Spread that scented lotion all around your curves
Anything you want, all she deserves
Baby calm your nerves make this work
Only thing in life you fear is being hurt
Here to protect thought otherwise
I'm here to correct you can trust me

[Verse 2: C.L. Smooth]
You and I now that's a hot couple
When it's off in the same club
Now you askin' for nothing but trouble
Watch you jumpin' at the Red Labels
Got my woman and her girlfriends dancin' on the tables
Shut down the joint, me I'm just laidback and all
Surrounded by the gangsters puffin' on the cigar
Badder chick in the world keep niggas cranked
Yes the hottest chick on the planet keep a nigga ranked
The question is can you top that homie
You can probably pull something close but stop that homie
Not even, could have that even if I stopped breathin'
Don't hope for that my ghost will be pokin' it still
Read my will my boys get it all no gimmicks
But I'm here to let you know my jump off is off limits
Life and love get made for a thug
Once I settled in you made me a gentleman

[Verse 3: C.L. Smooth]
Tot game is crazy diamonds on stilettos
Travel through these ghettos drop to top
Let 'em see what I'm workin' with came to win
How the don keeps the fun to blow in the wind
World war is magnetic that attracts loot
She look Wall Street briefcase, pen strife suit
The hair rub in a bun, spectacles on her nose
Any deal she makes, my business grows
They say a woman's never satisfied
Till she have me to fill it to her heart's content
It's my blessing, God gave you to me
And words can't describe, what you do for me
Your C.L. is, love me or love me not
But no-one can match this chemistry we got
Why they all fall, you C.L.'s wife
Cause all we got is eachother a bond for life[CL Smooth]
Introducing the Mecca fusion, physical type of funk using
Carmel cruising, brohter your latest lover smothered for deeper cover
Ass blown to breaks, individualized the fakes
Just because you're pouring syrup on this don't make it pancakes
My vocal assaults kept bouncing many amounts that count slackness
Pete Rock's sounds of blackness
The dark guages the flavor I supply
Now it's do or die, others are rolling the chocolate thai
I rip holes in shows, then move flocks of foes in straight
The Devil will find a way to infiltrate, never pray
I hear the scandal that be couped up in my town
So now we "Gotta Get Away" like Bobby Brown
The women will call it two letters that are instrumental
I focus my eyesight and run it down your genitals
Another dame when I tear it out the frame
Then armageddon came, it's not a game, it's on

It's not a game, no, with the Pete Rock funk
When the kids up in the Vernon got the flavor
It's not a game, no, with the Mecca Don flow
When the kids up in the Vernon got the flavor (Repeat 2x)

It's not a game when the Mecca Kane lucifer knows your name
Now I think I'm on the verge of black male growing extinct
Now my survival they libel the label homicidal
My spirits aren't idle, now you put your hands on the Bible
Now the opposite of my God is Nimrod
Taught by Master Faud, hard, now I'm pulling your card
We travel, unravel, dabble in the dopeness
A jam that make you want to know who wrote this
A sctipture from an odyssey, brothers in high velocity
And just like BDP, you know "My Philsophy"
Yeah here to outlast it, to never see the casket
A flute can make a snake rise up from the basket
So Pete Rock here we go, master the flow
(I don't want to be the last to know)
With the mellow funk tunes arriving with the card trainer plain
The black House of Pain, it's not a game, it's on

It's not a game, no, with the Pete Rock funk
When the kids up in the Vernon got the flavor
It's not a game, no, with the Mecca Don flow
When the kids up in the Vernon got the flavor (Repeat 2x)

The lucci's mine like the summertime, and I'm a set it first
Leaving a hearse when my third verse loads up to burst
To blast, never to tresspass, going to funk, keeping the crowd touring
The lyric is born on any stage we're walking on
So non-believer meet the Mecca, be chopping 'em like a meat cleaver
The scrambling quarterback and I'm the wide reciever
I get past you, and when it becomes a war
I go hardcore, matador, then all the bull is on the floor
I look and find the level of crime the time that I decipher
I'm bagging any sniper put a ball in Peter's Piper
We made the album of the year, rememer the Source kicks?
We should have been larger but it's all politics
So (Why you wanna, uh huh, play your games on me?)
Cause you called me a factor, get your skully cracked
The truth is coming to take mine
You want to take away more stitches than a Frankenstein
In '93 me and the P.R. make the dough
The honeys are licking all over my 5 o'clock shadow
A meanace to society, the pistol-packing YG
Mecca's the name, it's not a game, so don't try me

It's not a game, no, with the Pete Rock funk
When the kids up in the Vernon got the flavor
It's not a game, no, with the Mecca Don flow
When the kids up in the Vernon got the flavor (Repeat 2x)[Pete Rock]
Check it out, Lots of Lovin, Pete Rock, CL Smooth, on the remix tip
Check it out, come on

[CL Smooth]
What makes the world go round in your nightgown?
I know you're a sight I wanna see, so don't turn the lights down
You know I get all stiff when you kiss me
The heavy foreplay lets me know you're horny, baby
When your nipples get hard I wanna praise God
Thank Allah for just how dark you are
Call my cock "Sherlock" because I found Victoria's Secret
The holder of a hold it, now peep this
I want every kiss we share to be a French one
And after every orgasm call my name, hon
And tell me what you want so I can fulfill it
Taste the cream of life and don't spill it
Whether darker skin coolie or an Indian
If you're sick, the dixie L will be your medicine
When I'm in the penal tossing or bugging
Send me all the flicks cause I need lots of lovin

Lots of lovin, lots of lovin, lots of lovin, baby
Lots of lovin from me (Repeat 2x)

[CL Smooth]
Chocolate, what size you wear in a shoe?

[Pete Rock]
A thirteen, so you know I'm packing mean, the Boy Wonder's on the scene
So honey step to me if you want to grab the sticker
The Soul Brother's got it going on and much thicker
So slide to the side, hon, cause I'm a make it known
I need lots of love, on the strength, word is bond
So listen very close as I slam on the jam
The Pete Rock Mecca Don Smooth is the band
What's this with all the damn rumors that I hear?
I like light-skinned girls with chests out to here
(Now don't forget the long hair) People always talking
Why don't you shut your damn mouth and keep walking?
Cause you don't know the half, I love 'em how they come
Make sure you check the stats in my file before I'm done
It's time to get ghost, a bun in the oven
You're the one I'm thinking of with lots of lovin

Lots of lovin, lots of lovin, lots of lovin, baby
Lots of lovin from me (Repeat 2x)

[CL Smooth]
Take a bet on your money, ?army old at the federals?
Ring a bedspring, now you got a dollar on the mattress
Now feel the Mecca erupt as soon as you put your legs up
Babe you gotta be brave for me to be your love slave
Hot sex, next the friction got speed run
Neck and neck, you in effect, bag of weed for
The Wig Out, and let my balls tap your sugar walls
Like I'm sending a code saying "Yo Smooth is about to explode"
In your vagina, I work it like a surgeon
Butt naked version, many petitions on a virgin
You call me a bad man, I bend her like a beer can
Drank roots, knock boots, and the woman couldn't even stand
But I'm the love of your life, so give me respect, sister
Although she blow, know that I still kiss her
Hard and handy to tickle your fancy
To crews you're hopping young and blue just like an odd jammie
With an "uhh" in the projects or parlay in the condo
You wonder who's the mass maker, you forgot Tonto
But never forgot to hit the spot, the real bodyguarder
If it ain't good enough, I work harder
Carmel King with the Mecca Don swing
To make your panties sing "Ding a ling a ling"
CL Smooth to make a move with the smooching and the hugging
Cause women will need lots of lovin

Lots of lovin, lots of lovin, lots of lovin, baby
Lots of lovin from me (Repeat 8x)[AZ]
Yeah... poet, politician, playa when necessary
This is AZ, I'm your host for the evening
It's Magic Hour... How we gonna do this?

[Verse 1: AZ]
No stress, we on the sands in Tahiti
Bare chest, you bastards, 30 grand on the pinky
Respect, finesse movements like your hands in grafitti
Grey Goose, mixed with grape, cran and the kiwi
It's truth holds galore
Rolls go clothes galore; take paper till they close the door
Either or, corner hustle or hustle on tour
To seen it all, nothing left but to stumble no more
And the sex is phantasm
Flow, campaigns 'em
Dough, can't change 'em
Courts, can't arraign 'em
It's sports, Titanium quartz, Iranian taught
I came in force, all the bangers is brought
Brought the bang at your fort, torch and tangle your thoughts
Scorch and stand if you're short
So of course, just to chill and conversate, Mil- and Salaam-ulate
Millions I'm trying to chase illin' from out the gate
Get it right my feelin's is not awake
Ducatti bikes, shipped from out of state
The pressure is on, the blunts is lit
My presence is strong, it's real I'm amongst the mix
The Wesson is long, I move like I'm on some shit
So testin' is wrong cause once guns is drawn, that's it
The beats the rap the game is done
We leave, we at, we smack, we bang them guns
We beat with bats, we scrap, we came, we come
So, peace to that he's back nigga, one...

[C.L. Smooth]
Yea, Chairman of the Board, man
Black Leader, the Mecca Don
El Presidente... Ladies and Gentlemen

[Verse 2: C.L. Smooth]
All I do is bring the life to a dead game the moment I came
Under my umbrella, my flag, my name
If the ship leaving the port, cruise to the resort
You can't be serious baby, this is sport
Gotta make my rounds, head wolf of this pack
Till it's me an A' steppin' out of both sides of that Maybach
We can eat lovely, just don't interrupt me
And mix all this checkmate with that quiet money
I can see it all bubblin' the move is no troublin'
I'mma give you the plug and the Sosa
They all love CL, no jail for homey
Only gotta tell me one time, Don't fuck me Tony
Just buy weight fly straight and keep me right
And I don't care what I spend on security
It helps me sleep at night
See nothing sharp as me
You take it in air, you can't compare
To the initials engraved in my office chair
The boss is here, we deep in the game
You can't do it the same
You gotta bring a strong leash for your dame or pop up
Speaking of cheddar, me and son peak it together
Can't feel it's the real deal or let the meatballs meet the Beretta
Smellin' like fresh cut leather
Odd color called sarsaparilla
The curtain is drawn the seat's vanilla
Let him see heat forever
Taking that seat empowers
All you want in this Magic Hour[ VERSE 1: C.L. Smooth ]
Okay, you wanna act trife and flip the script
With your Wonderama drama slash coma riff
That you're kickin like Pele, flows even Bo knows
My versatility capability is simply ?????
Y to the o-u-n-g, another G-to the u-n-s
Let's back up, shortie, from the naughty like ?????
Berry Gordy with a forty gettin papes, oh Lordy
Claim you shoot more rounds than an Uzi
Stop the violence, cause ya can't do me
New York to L.A. say what I play
So catch a runaway smooth like a Billie Holiday
You couldn't bag me, boy, with a hefty
Train like Rocky but still can't step to me
So take a hint, money, leave it alone
And play like Stephanie Mills and 'find a home'
Plus I never boogaloo with Jacub
We're mixed with the tricks in a alphabet stew
When I design a army I can reign
But never have more beef than Saddam Hussein
The Night Cap, so prepare for a cascam
When I turn your brain into Moogoo Gai-Pan
Finger-lickin the papes like there is no other

Schizophrenic, on a panic I do work
When you lurk with the professional ceremonial expert
The bold swinger, the Asiatic acrobatic
Lovable, sing the blues when I tap it
Save the mystery for Agatha Christie
Gimme a break, better wake Chief Kanisky
I'm not your ordinary modern day clichee
Cause I'm here to save you little lost souls anyway
Go with the flow with the fleets when it exectues
Any comp livin got buried in black suits
The limelight, never let it confuse you
It's a _Fantasy Island_ without a Tatoo
The hardcore few tend to look for
It's true, can't buy a knuckle game in the stores
Makin movies like your name is Faye Dunaway
To hear the rumor echo in the project's hallway
You want a fast break, me no static
But Mister Whipple can't dribble like Magic
I yolk em up in domination, nerds got scrambled
The Tony Randall left in shambles
Finger-lickin the papes like there is no other

Let me see..
Pete Rock is like salad dressing
When I toss another lesson
Ready or not, prime time after seven
I pull women like a wisdom tooth
Without any conversation with Doctor Ruth
Makin all the girls wind with the glamity
'When Doves Cry', Apollonia and Vanity
Picture the Mary Jane frame on a mantle
Consider me a vandal the Virgin can't handle
And never clown downtown with ?????
Popping that yang riffin "Homie don't play dat"
So don't gas the kid to make a movie
While I'm smackin a booty who just love to rock a doobie
Even though I make petty cash like a beggar
With no stash I make ???? sweater
So the Night Cap of rappin, no slackin, backin
Hand clappin, feet tappin Chief and Captain
Could finger-lick the papes like there is no other

Song: Nighttrain

Land of the free
But the skin I'm in identifies me
So the people around me
Energize me
Callin' all aboard this train ride
Talkin' 'bout raw hardcore
Leavin' frauds on the outside
But the bad thing is anyone can ride the train
And the reason
For that is cause we look the same
Lookin' all around at my so called friend
Light skin to the brown
The black
Here we go again
Homey over there knows Keith an
But he be thiefin'
I don't trust him
Rather bust 'em
Up out goes his hand and I cough
He once stole from me
Yeah I wanna cut it off
The black thing is a ride I call the nighttrain
It rides the good and the bad
We call the monkey trained
Trained to attack the black it's true
Cause some of them look just like you

Stayin' on the scene
Sittin' on the train
See all the faces
Look about the same
There go the sellout who's takin' a ride like Cargo
Cause he deal
The keys from Key Largo
Runnin' Nat narcotic
By George he got it
Takin' makin' the G erotic
And the fiends they scheme
So he can put 'em down
But his method is wreck 'em
Put 'em in tha ground
Got tha nerve as hell
To yell brother man
He ain't black man
Cuz he ate his Pac Man
Known to murder his own
Traitor on the phone
Ridin' the train
Self-hater trained
To sell pain
The master's toy
Little boy
Hard to avoid he look wit' it but he null 'n' void
Cause he ridin' the train you think he down for the cause
Cause his face looks just like yours

(CL Smooth)
The conductor, track the structure overstood
Nighttrain the plain, little engine that could
One express so let's next stops Mecca
A place to face to make a black man better
CL and Chuck D, we don't talk rubbage
But just like a slave, we gotta ride wit the luggage
On the nighttrain

More of the same insane who sayin'
Like flowin' like nighttrain
Runnin' the pain of the black reign
You look, you laugh
You doubt and go out
And I'm gone
But the bass goes on
To talk the talk, but walk the walk
The king of New York
Crack a lack attack the black
To crack the back
Once again I test a friend wit' sincerity
Or consider him an enemy
Who am I to tell a lie
Rather push the Bush
Hope da cracker get crushed
I'm rollin' wit Rush
Leader of the bum rush
Russian I ain't
Spreadin' like paint
Lookin' at the put I got
And its kickin'
But it ain't chicken
But it's livin' for a city
So sick 'n' tired
Of a scene buckwild, piled in a file
Senile or chile
They said it never been no worser
Than this, I'm on the nighttrain
They hope ya don't miss it
Give ya what dey gotta give you just go
You musn't just put your
Trust in every brother yo
Some don't give a damn
Cause they the other man
Worse than a bomb
Posin' as Uncle Toms
Disgracin' the race
Blowin' up the whole crew
Wit' some of them lookin'
Just like youSpeaking [CL Smooth]:
Yeah, CL Smooth, DJ JS-One
Sadat X, there's nuthin' anyone can say
Here we go
Yes, yes, uh, uh

Sample: There's nothing anyone can say (X3)

Verse One (CL Smooth):
I bring a lean with it, toss a little green with it
Heavy on my team with it, bust up on the scene with it
There's nothing you can say, we be sipping rose
You can quote the whole game but son +I Did It My Way+
So clean and proper, that black Sinatra
Another showstopper, we let it loose mama
In the club with it, circle all the love with it
Meet me on the dance-floor, what you think we here for?
I'm so excellent, you're looking at the president
You youngins tried to dumb it out but I was more intelligent
And so Hip Hop, and so mainstream
We talking new cream, you on the wrong team
We do it all day, castle to the hallway
I came from the bottom up, there's nuthin' you can say

[Hook X3: Samples]
"Nuthin' anyone can say"
"Somebody say, say nothin'"- KRS-One

Verse two (Brother Ali):
What do you say to a man who been to hell and back
Escaped out of Satan's hands with his head in tact
Made his own plans when there was no welcome mat?
Dog I'll tell you what you tell him
You don't tell him jack
Since you fine time rappers I hurt you motherfuckers
I beddie ? tuck you under covers
I already outlast half of these youngstas
Chill catch your breath
Ain't nuthin' you should mumble
Still nuthin' come from bumpin' your gums
Baby I come where you from
Get the hum buggin' begun
I was raised on that +Mecca+ and that +All For One+
I've been training for the record since the story was spun
Can run from the culture
Either kill or be killed
Now let your little bad breath will be still
Say nuthin'

Chorus [X3]

Speaking [Brother Ali]:
Ah, yes y'all. You are now rockin' with the best of the best y'all
JS-1 is on the wheels of steel
This is Brother Ali and we in here tonight
The great CL Smooth and Sadat X
Ha, I snuck my way on this track right here
Sadat what up?

Speaking [Sadat X]:
Yeah that's right, Sadat X
CL and JS

Verse Three [Sadat X]:
There's nuthin' you can say about X
Sadat X the great, the godfather
See him up on Broadway with the O'Jays chilling
I might not had a top billing, but I'm straight
I'm cool for travel, the passport is a pass cause
There's nuthin' anyone can say
You want to go to gunplay, I don't think you want that
We keep the burners but we don't flaunt that
For eight months I was laid up in the New York jail
Only contact by the phone or the mail
They didn't give a nigga bail but I handled it
Came home, ate dinner with my baby, it was candle lit
No parole, Sadat stay ready to roll
JS, hit these niggas with that soul
I'm never too old, I won't stop till I pop
Can't we get past this radio slop?

[Hook X4]
