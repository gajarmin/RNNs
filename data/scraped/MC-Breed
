[Hook]
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours X2
I gotta get mine
Get yours

[Verse 1: MC Breed (2Pac)]
Aiyyo I'm Smooth as I wanna be, for pussy you's a gonna, G
(Oh, that's the way it is?)
Fuck yeah and that's the way it's gonna be
(Why), puffin up on tha dank and drinking mad brew
Taking names and after that I'm kickin ass too
Breed, time to flow (can I get a rhyme to go)
Hell yeah, Pac, I'll sit back, straight up design it slow
They hate to see a young nigga, (come up)
Another punk, (run up) and have to get his, (gun up)
Cause um I ain't takin no shots
Like a Newport fort, exploitin the floor like Jordan
Explodin on the hoop court.
And I don't wanna be, I-don't-wanna-be nuttin like Mike
Cause even Mike was like it's a itsy bitsy wet triflin
And when you in the spotlight, you get um jocked right
But your knot's not tight
Buckin anybody who fuck wit' mine
When will they realize? I'm straight out to get mine

[Hook] - 6X

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
I keep my mind on my money, money on my mind
Finger on the trigger, nigga, hand on my nine
Smokin blunts a skunk, makin holes in punks
And only underground funk pumpin outta my trunk
Live the life of a hustler: high till I die;
Meetin bitches, gettin riches, miss me with lies
Picture me living out my life as a busta
I'd rather pop out a shot from my Glock, and blast motherfuckers
I live the thug life, baby, I'm hopeless
Chokin off indo trying to keep my focus
Don't let that bullshit worry me
Fuck the fame, I'm true to the game 'til they bury me
God gave me game so I'm hustlin
Pour out some liqour for my niggas, 2Pac is still strugglin!
My nigga Breed knew the time
Whether it's rhyme or crime, nigga, I gotta get mine

[Hook] - 6X

[Verse 3: MC Breed]
Now, tell me
Can you measure the amount of applause I keep gettin?
Everytime I pick up a mic and start spittin
The sidewalks of New York will start bumpin
Jumpin around, with the motherfuckin pound
And I'm down to the fullest, and breakin niggas ass off proper
Did I shock you, cause I got you in my pocket again
Them new jacks and you jacks
Who knew me and my niggas, when I used to run it way back when
I boasted, and roasted, and coasted to the pinnacle
Because of what I do with a pen
It's vernacular precision
Connect the two lines and it's division
Plus, when I add lutes and flutes
It's guaranteed to sell like prostitutes
I never had love for hoes who put it blunt
And want me in the back, but, bitch, I'm in the front!
Don't front, and really I don't need a reply
Pull yourself together as you pass me by
I'm on a whole another level, them hoes is left
I told you before, keep ya pussy to yourself
Goodbye, some many niggas lied to have
Funny what a motherfucker do for math
I got fractions caught up in my everday actions
Point equal to your real satisfaction
Buckin anybody who fuck wit' mine
When will they realize, I'm straight out to get mine haha

[Hook] - 6XIntro : (Flavor Flav)

To the beat Ya'll

Ah yeah

(Ya don't stop) --] Flavor Flav

Sound good to me

[ VERSE 1: MC Breed ]
This sound hard, somethin' funky people gon' dance to
Give the record a second and a chance to
Hittin' people like a scene of amazement
While they slippin' back my feet is planted in the pavement
Crumble I can never do
So now I'm lookin' dead at you
What are you gonna do?
You listen to the knowledge of a scholar
You say "How Breed?" tell em how I holler
I'm the E Double, and I proclaim my name
Straight up good game, peeps all game
I'm like a rhino runnin' through the roughest pack
They figure I'm a trigga-happy nigga, so they step back
Breed, the microphonist
Boot last the longest
The noose's the strongest
It ain't a game, that's plain to see
You listen to the sounds of Breed (and the DFC)

There ain't no future in your frontin'

[ VERSE 2: MC Breed ]
I never got caught with a kilo
And if you ever do, yo, it will never be with me, yo
Servin' in a Cherokee or maybe it's a GTO
Black-on-black Benzo, I get it at [Name]
Never have to worry bout my posse gettin' jumped
Cause if we ever do, yo TB, pop the trunk
Cause we don't go for playin', when I play go grab a ball
When I'm on the mic I ain't for playin', not at all
Cause I clock 10 g's a week boomin' at my peak
Always seek E sober, but I do get geeked
I can give you a job, a place to eat hearty
Meet your homeboy Marty at a b.o.b. party
Takin' over, barkin' like a dog named Rover (woof!)
I'm pickin' suckers like a four-leaf clover
They're bitin' lyrics on the mic, I diss these cobras
So now they're sayin', "Eric Breed is gettin' over"

There ain't no future in your frontin'
Ha-ha-ha
There ain't no future in your frontin'

[ VERSE 3: MC Breed ]
I'm the B, the r to the double e-d and
Down with my homie G-a-s and O.E. and
Suckers causin' static, cause they still be disagreein'
I don't give a - cause I'm from F-l-i-n-t'n
A city where pity runs low
If you ever shoot through my city, now you know
Cause we are strictly business and we also got our pride
And if you don't like it, I suggest you break wide
Suckers steady lookin' for the m-o-n-e-y and
Thinkin' that illegal is the best way, so they dyin'
I ain't got time to see a fiend fiend out
To give up all his money, and he givin' what he got
That's the way I am, MC Breed cannot be different
Never change my ways for the world or the government
If I was the president, then I would state facts
You leave it up to me, I paint the white house black
It ain't no future in your frontin'

There ain't no future in your frontin'

[ VERSE 4: MC Breed ]
Yeah, I got dollars in my pocket, not from rollin'
If I was a fiend, then my gold would be stolen
Put my name Breed on everything I own
And when I get my jeep I'm puttin' 'Breed' on the chrome
Shine it up good, kickin' through my neighborhood
Motorola phone, fat rims and a Kenwood
Quick to get around it, and then I'll have it drop
Simply cause I'm ridin' people think I'm sellin' rocks
But ain't no future in your frontin'

Yo Flash man, drop that, man
Won't you drop that

(Keep on)
(To the beat ch'all)

[ VERSE 5: MC Breed ]
Cruel to the rules of the world
Live my life raw, cause I never liked the law
Wear top tens, on my ass use jeans
Sellin' big 8ths and tit-for-tat to the fiends
Clock much dollars, but I never break a sweat
Time to move out, my posse sayin' (bet)
You got my back, and I got yours
What time is it? Hm, Tear down the doors

Man
There ain't no future in your frontin'
Never was, cuz
There ain't no future in your frontin'

Hey man, let's start this party up, right?

(Beat y'all)
(Keep on)[MC Breed talking]
Hey check this out Short, you know what I'm saying?
Yeah you down here in Oakland, you know what I'm saying?
And I'm all up in Michigan, you know what I'm talking about? I need
To get up on my pimpin, you know what I'm talking bout? I need to be
A player nowadays you know what I'm saying? Niggas need to know how
To play these hoes you know what I'm saying? On the strength, why dont you put me up on that pimpin shit?

[Short Dawg]
I do it like the best of the greatest, not the worst
Like welfare day, can't stop the first of the month
Can't stop Short Dawg neither
Got a good ho niggas sure better keep her
Cause I'm on the prowl, all the time
Tryin knock every bitch so they all be mine
And I ain't never, ever gone change my ways
Drop a few lines, leave a bitch in a daze
Have her homegirls wonderin what she do
Fucked around and gave me that pussy too
I be doin this shit on a regular basis
Got bitches everywhere in all kind of places
I can pull out my little black phone book
Flip every last page take a long look
Than pull out a bitch, like a rabbit out a hat
Nigga if I want, I can have it like that
Fuck two or three bitches at the same time
Grab the microphone sing my rhyme
About them same three bitches that fucked me good
Us niggas gotta do what the fuck we should when we want to
I might pass it
So get butt naked, shake that ass bitch
I'm bout as real as the stones in my diamond rings
You can hate my guts, but I'm gone do these things, bitch

[MC Breed and (Too Short) talking]
Like that Short? Uhh, can't take shorts just cause your name Short
Matta fact Imma quit taking shorts man
(Spit a little game to em Breed)

[MC Breed]
Ahhh why have a nine, when I can have a ten
If she ain't Lickin up the nuts, while I'm gone holler at her friend
Bitch, ain't no time for me to teach her
Rather have an everyday ho, that umm knows how to treat a nigga
Thinkin if she ain't lickin me up
I'm givin her to Short, cause he don't give a fuck
Do yourself a favor and quit callin my house
If you really don't want this nigga to put this dick in your mouth
Umm, have you seen my bitch?
I ain't seen her, but if I do she gets dick
That's what I'm givin her just like that
To the front and back, nothing but the bozack
The second she get lonely, feelin she can get her money
And she run to fuck her own ignorant homey
You a lost cause, yellin pause when they drop the draws
Its's entrapment, have yo nigga breakin nigga laws
But it ain't a matter of mentality, it's reality
Open your eyes, realize bitches ain't nothin but a casuality
But a factor to a nigga wanting fuckin time
She's just an everday, don't wanna catch her fuckin mine
Bitch ain't mine, so I thought you knew this
Bitch this is how I do this

[Mc Breed talking]
Short I know you ain't done explaining, you know what I'm saying?
Pimpin is an all american sport, you know what I'm saying? A lotta
People and got that down pat yet but uh why dont you explain it out for em

[Short Dawg]
You can call eight ball in the corner when you shootin pool
But when you play the game of life, ain't no stupid rules
Gotta go for yours at all times
Cause if you don't, nigga yours will be mine
And I won't go to bed early, won't sleep too late
And I'll never take a punk ass bitch on a date
They say Too Short baby why you talk so bad?
Just a player ass nigga and that's all I rap about
Bitches, hoes and all that shit
She got my number, if she beep me I might call the bitch
And go diggin in them guts like a gardener
If she starts screamin, I'm gone fuck the ho harder
Just havin fun with the bitch, as she sprung on my dick
Guess I'll pull it out and just cum on the bitch
And from New Year's Day to New Year's Eve
And everyday in between I will do these things, I don't stop bitch

[Mc Breed talking]
Hahahaha, that nigga Short, uh uh yeah uh

[MC Breed]
I like to go to the club mix and mingle
Nigga plays his dick like a 12 inch single
Yeah, so what you bitches wanna do?
Step to me you gots to do my crew, first
When I rehearse I change rearrange
My mentality will bring you to reality
You on me like cologne 'til now
I feel it's time for us to bone
So I look and pimp the background
Look, listen put the bitch on lockdown
Yeah you hangin out with me tonight
Everythings alright, but a nigga wanna fight
Damn, that's a real player hater for ya
Fuck it, I'll be waitin for ya

[Father Dom]
I'm droppin lines like a mother fuckin pimp at this shit
I'm gettin hoes out they clothes cause I'm good at this shit
They callin me the pussy jammer cause I'm breakin hoes off
See I'm paid to be boss, I'm kickin back at no cost
Never slackin, just mackin, money stackin that's my motto
With so much game they want to play me like the lotto
Tip the bottle, now I'm drunk as a skunk
High off the dank, but I can't front
See I'm never being senile
See I'm smooth as a nail on a fingernail file
Keepin it wild, but in the meanwhile we the coolest
Sure enough this how we do this

[2Pac]
I'm fingerfuckin' with my diamonds
Now peep a nigga climbin' the charts
Ain't no fear in my heart, I represent it from the start
Deep, my momma raised me as a G from birth
Be a hustlin' motherfucker 'til I sees my hearse
No doubt, I bust a shot for all my niggas in jail
All the young black males, that gotta slang yayo
Cause it's a hard life nigga only thugs survive
Ain't no love, unless a nigga slangin' drugs or high
Conversations with these bitches on my mobile
Always in control and never let these bitches know you
And even though I'm gettin high, a thug nigga gettin by
Catchin' bitches spittin' lies, I'm gettin' mine
All day, I puff a blunt and parlay and sometimes if we party
Gettin my dick licked twice
And death to a trick's life, we can pursue this 'til my shit's right
Went from havin' fantasies, to havin' hoes leave they man for me
There is no realer man than me
The city of Oaktown laced me with my first case
When them punk police tried to break me
Didn't think the shit was cute, so I got a lawsuit
And made them punk police buy my coupe
This is how we do this[Ice Cube]
One, two, three and I come with the wicked
White house, lights out
Boom boom boom with the Bop Gun
Looks like I dropped one
I'm top gun, so picture..
(Picture this, paint a picture, picture perfect, paint a perfect picture)
Bill Clinton
(Picture this, paint a picture, picture perfect, paint a perfect picture)
(*Phone Beaping*)
Here we go y'all

[George Clinton]
Paint the White House black, brown

[Dr. Dre]
Ha ha, yeah, what's up?
What's boppin?
This is Dr. Dre callin' from Chronic Control
Could I speak to the president?
Awww, yeah, just tell him he was smokin' last night at the club
You know what I'm sayin?
What? - he don't inhale?
Well I know, I got the wrong motherfuckin' house
Did somebody beap me from there?

[George Clinton]
Colors don't clash, people just do
Color me happy next to you
Aww, just like it should, there goes the Neighborhood
That is what they'd have us believe

[Hook: George Clinton]
Paint the White House black, brown
Paint the White House..
(*Sample of Police Sirens*)
Paint the White House black, brown
Paint the White House, black...

[George Clinton]
Uhhhh lookin' through a view of views
Seein' what they want you to
Blinded by the flames of friendly fire
And then they sat there like a dope
Until they choked from all that smoke
From behind a smoke screen of the patriotic liars

[Dr. Dre]
Aiyyo, well check this out
If you talked to George Clinton
Tell him I'll catch him at the next plateau with the bomb
You know what I'm sayin?
It's not the pretendo but the endo
And I'll be droppin' some straight Chronic at his front door

[Hook: George Clinton with Ice Cube and Pupa Curley]
Paint the White House black, brown
Paint the White House..
(Cause white ain't right, so get the flashlight)
Paint the White House black, brown
(No matter what creed, no matter what color)
Paint the White House..

[Flavor Flav]
Now, check this out

[Chuck D]
Yo yo Flavor man, we could kick like this
Yo, we could kick it man, yo, word up, man
Yo, check this out man
You know, the homeboys in Detroit, in Minneapolis, in L.A
In New York and down in D.C. man
They got the system in the back and boomin' it
But they don't know what we're sayin'
But the homeboys know what we're sayin'
You know what I'm sayin?
Yo, check Yo-Yo

[Yo-Yo]
If love ain't got nothin' to do with it then keep it
Ain't no big secret, we all know the reason
People change everyday but life stays the same
One big game, ain't a damn thing changed
A woman's got to do what a woman's got to do
Be a mackstress, don't let these mackers mack you
So I get caught up in it, I'm stressin' and tired
The man who runs the joint gets me higher
It can be a White House, a black house
It can be a crack house, an out house
If it ain't the right house, go get your army gears baby
We got a fight, they ain't gonna set aside another night
(*Sample of Police Sirens*)
It's so bad that Los Angeles, is so scandalous
Give me somebody, who can handle us
Yo-Yo is on the top of things
So uhh.. color me mad, I'm ready for a change

[MC Breed]
I done came up short, one time too many
Yet a brother got to be comin' out his nickles
And countin' up his last pennies
Buyin' brushes and bum rushin' homey's greenery
Many envy but a hill of beans is what it means to me
Leave it up to me, I'm paintin' the White House black
There ain't no future in your frontin'
So why the hell you're frontin' jack?
It'll either change or we're gonna change it
"Yeah, it's gettin' old"
Usin' everything, from spray cans to charcoal
Put them up, then put the crew up on discharge
Leavin' wet paint signs in the front yard

[Flavor Flav]
Yo George, these people crazy man
They don't even know what I'm sayin'

[George Clinton]
Awwwwww airbrushed and colorized
Just changed right before our eyes, real as visualized
In every frame and let the love shine from the right house
Be in the black, red or white house
Through our fear the puppeteer can pull our strings
Whoaahh, well alright, again I say or say can you see
The puppeteer pull the strings of you and me from the White House
The out house of territorial conquest
The HUD House, the pro-this, the anti-that
White against black, the right to life versus pro-choice

[KAM]
I pledge allegiance to the flag
Being all I could never be.. KAM READ HIS TOE TAG
Yeah, this is USA-K all day and you can't interrupt
Lay back, WATT'S UP
Stars and stripes for Tarzan types
Got brothers like me behind bars and on pipes
Damn, I'm gettin' took for a trip
They got me seein' stars from the club and stripes from the whip
Why must you all be like that?
I ain't into politics, so skip them white-collared tricks
They never did us no good
To hell with the space shuttle, put some money in the hood
And make jobs, let's mob up to the capitol
Then we ain't got to rap at all
Power To The People and the only way to get free
Is the J-to-the-U-S-T-I-C-E

[George Clinton w/ KAM]
Picture this, paint a picture, picture perfect, paint a perfect picture
Y'all can't stop the bum rush, so get the paint brush
It's time for a change
Paint the White House black, brown

[Dr. Dre]
Yo, listen to the real Clinton "WHO BILL CLINTON?"
Hell no, I'm talkin' about George Clinton

[George Clinton]
Paint the White House black, brown

[Pupa Curley]
All one blood, only a different color
And in a dis ya time, you have to help your neighbor
Look at the downtown area, no food to eat, no shelter
Them people have to live in a house made of paper
And when it rains it falls through like a sift wire
Hunger deh hunger, all over about time
All of us come together
Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, N.W.A, Flavor Flav, Chuck D
Public Enemy, Flea, Anthony stirrin' up the Chili
Yo-Yo, KAM and Breed, Prince and Pupa that's me

[Ice Cube]
One, two, three and I come with the wicked
Boom boom boom with the Bop Gun, looks like I dropped one
You can get with this or you can get with it
Got to peel his cap, who's the mack?
Shit, I'll paint the White House black

[Hook: George Clinton & Pupa Curley]
Picture this, paint a picture, picture perfect, paint a perfect picture

[George Clinton]
Picture this, paint a picture, picture perfect, paint a perfect picture

[Ice Cube]

Droppin' on your punk ass motherfuckers and that's how we do it
You know what I'm sayin? yeah

[George Clinton]
Paint the White House black, brown
Those who oppose to be leveled up next to this
I ain't the devil, this ain't The Exorcist
Worse than a nightmare, you don't have to sleep on wink
The pain the mind gets everytime you think
Flashbacks, interfere, you start to hear
P-Funk in your ear

[Dr. Dre]
Ha yeah, what's up?
This is Dr. Dre callin' from Chronic Control
Peace and hair grease, I'm ouuuuuuut!

Sippin' on that Hen low inhale a good smoke now hold ya breath gag and choke

(Bootleg)
And I got dollars in my pocket not from rollin'
Since I'm not a fiend the my jewlery never stollin'
Puttin' "Bootleg" on everything I own
My white Navigator, 8 twelves on chrome
It's the return of the Dayton thugs fresh out of prison
But I'm still bugged nothin' but slugs for me mugs
Me and 3-6 tearin' up the club anybody violate the family is gettin' drugged
Bootleg who said he can flow like I, I doubt it
Besides that fact Relativity won't allow it
You can borrow my style but please bring it home
Cause my style be missin' its owner when I'm gone
Ain't no future in your frontin'

(Chorus) x2(Yeah)

Tell you 'bout my bitch

(Oh-oh, baby)

Some might even say she our bitch

(Yeah)

I don't even trip

(Oh-oh, baby)

(It's you I'm keepin nigh
You, baby, that gets me high
You blew my mind a thousand times
My savior of a troubled life
Laced up too just how I like
Everything sweet, a pure delight
You got me fiending day and night
Anticipating your very sight)

I was 16 years old when I met this ho from Flint
And found she was out cold when I tried to let her through
Flashbacks of bein without her, with me
Fucked with me till I went and got her with me
Every day niggas ask about her, I know they on her
But I'm gon' hit this corner
To keep em from gettin on her when I want her
She appear, she in my system like a bomber
Name was Sinsemilia, that's why I love her
She never played me jealous, though
When I be fuckin with some other ho that she don't know
She in the cut like 'I don't give a fuck'
She's just so potent that she know she got me stuck
Run over like a truck
To me it's all a pipe dream
I'm knowin if she leave then I be on fiend
Though, so I lean like I'm supposed to
Come up with something no one can come close to
She help out, sometimes she let me in
And tell me, "That's because I love the way you took me in
I work better on whatever if you got some gin
So get the Seagram, we can see if we can both win"
She like that, I write that dopeness
Cause she got my focus
Clownin like it was jokers
Buzzin like it was locust
The only ho I ever loved
Since I came up in this muthafucka, that's My Dove

(Miss Dove, you got me feeling high
Miss Dove, so high as the star sky
Miss Dove, I place no above her
My Dove, the only ho I love)

She was the baddest thing I ever hit
I think it was November back in '86
Outside the [Name] she was doper than those other hoes
I've been bent since her scent first hit my nose
Light-skinned, peach fuzz got me buzzin and chasin
Strokin her with my cousin in the basement
She's all I ever needed when I was rhymin
I started clockin and lacin my girl with white diamonds
And I was all in
About this time is when I started ballin
I never got caught above or fallin short
When haulin some dope from my niggas in Flint out of Detroit
She kick it with my when I roll her with my dogs
Smoked out, cause this is not your ordinary broad
'No future' brought me closer to her
I use the odor through my lyrics when I do it to her
She like that, and I write that dopeness
Cause she got my focus
Clownin like it was jokers
Buzzin like it was locust
The only ho I ever loved
Since I came up in this muthafucka, that's My Dove

(Miss Dove, you got me feeling high
Miss Dove, so high as the star sky
Miss Dove, I place no above her
My Dove, the only ho I love)

"Ooh, la-la-la
Look at fat, fat ass" when my girl walk by
Wearin shit like plastic and askin why
All these niggas in my area be actin high
Like they watchin Toni Braxton in they bedroom lie
Missionary and be very interested in I
Get up in her like a winner cause that ass too fly
I wish she had a pager
So I can hit her off with somethin major
I'm sayin she a ho, I know, still a nigga don't pay her
24/7 she got her ass in the air
Fuckin with some other song
But I'm gon' still fuck her with no rubber on
That's where we at, everyday I be with my girl
Sometime I think she twisted like a jherri curl
Cause she be in these hoes' mouth constantly
Then right back in my pocket where she 'sposed to be
They say they always see my ho off in the Bay
I guess I get with Davey, let him know I'm on my way
Hooked up the Yukon, the futon, I got the bomb, and it's all day
So let's get it on like we Marvin Gaye
And so I stay ever ready to be bustin like confetti
On your whole congregation of blatant player-hation
But she say, "Fuck em
Punk-ass muthafuckas ain't really sayin nothin"
She like that, and I write that dopeness
Cause she got my focus
Clownin like it was jokers
Buzzin like it was locust
The only ho I ever loved
Since I came up in this muthafucka, that's Miss DoveLet's go ridin, sidin, whippin and dippin
I know it's my car bitch, you ain't trippin
It's your favorite color, on a lovely day
You let me reach right over, and rub on your leg
I'm sayin all kind of shit, to make you smile
Put your seatbeat on, cause I be drivin wild
You think I'm like them other niggas, I just wanna fuck
But I like to get money and get my dick sucked
I ain't your average everyday little ho nigga
And I can see through you bitch youse a gold digger
Tellin me stories, about the richest man
But I'm Too $hort baby, the bitch's pimp
I come a long way from young and done the certified player
I get what I want, and I'mma holler at you later
If you ain't got game you might think I'm a trick
Don't play yourself girl you won't get no dick
I take you right back home so you can be witcha man
I know you sucker motherfuckers won't understand
See me with a bitch and say I floss too hard
These hoes ain't trippin on me, they wanna fuck my car

Now whether on the strip, or in the bar
If you put your mind to it, you might get far
No need to be a player or a superstar
She ain't trippin on you she'd rather fuck your car

She could care less about a real man
All she wants is a man with the meal plan
Pick her up in the Benz and hope she get to eat
Every day is Halloween ho, trick or treat
I throw your ass in the trunk with a bag of rats
Drop you off at Kaiser like they did in The Mack
I know you're broke, fantasizing like Mariah
Get a grip on my bumper, rub your clit on my tire
You can ride on top or wrap your legs around the frame
But if you get in this car you gonna respect this game
And I'm knowin that, I hope you know it too
Only real pimps know what I'm goin through
It's a daily mission, controllin these bitches
Uphold the pimpin, never start sympin
Got the cleanest drop Caddy for your eyes to see
So c'mon bitch and take a ride with me

Now I'm about big blocks, drop tops
White guts ending with much knock
Got loot but dough ain't even trippin on it
Got keys, to three hundred Z's, knowin these bitches

Now whether on the strip, or in the bar
If you put your mind to it, you might get far
No need to be a player or a superstar
She ain't trippin on you she'd rather fuck your car

I gave you a ride for some head cause my dick was soft
But if you ain't widdit I'mma drop you off
I got hoes all around me all day and night
And yo little pussy's just way too tight
For a big black dick like mine to slide in
I take my motherfuckin time and ride it
Cause ain't no punk bitches where I'm from
They like to suck niggas dicks, and make us cum
So get butt-naked let me slap that ass
Play with them titties while I tap that ass
Slam your face in the pillow, and arch that back
Have you lovin this dick like it's made of crack
Cocaine, and you know that costs
Can't fuck for free you got to pay the boss
Hundred dollar bills bitch
I break your ass and won't feel shit
Cause pimpin, pimpin, that's my game
I got it from the O where it always rains
Pimp game, now it's time to roll
And take my hoes down to the ho stroll

Now whether on the strip, or in the bar
If you put your mind to it, you might get far
No need to be a player or a superstar
She ain't trippin on you she'd rather fuck your car

You ain't slammin doors like me cause I'm the coldest mack
From a brand new Benz to my old school 'llac
You ain't never gon stop my pimpin style
It's like two plus two, can you figure it out?
You say, what fo', I say that's right
You know the answer nigga pimpin for life
What's a trick to a ho, some dope to a fiend
What's a bag of weed if the shit ain't green
You say the game is forever, well so am I
You only got two choices bitch, ho or die
Now speak up, you better say somethin
Before I turn your ass back into a pumpkin
Cause ain't no motherfuckin fairy tales
Only Freaky Tales, and I tell em so well bitch
Now get your ass in the car
Don't play me too close I won't pimp you too hard

Now whether on the strip, or in the bar
If you put your mind to it, you might get far
No need to be a player or a superstar
She ain't trippin on you she'd rather fuck your car
(repeat 2X)Too $hort:
If your a real hustler your sure to get rich

[Hook]
This is for the hustlaaaas, come on
This is for the hustlaaaas, ohh
This is for the hustlaaaas, come on
This is for the hustlaaaas, ohh
Ohh, come on, come on

[Verse 1: Too $hort]
I make money like a motherfucker
It ain't no thang to me
$hort Dog in the house spittin game with Breed
Ain't no bust partner, that's the third week
I'm going to pimp these hoes, they can't work me
How the hell you think I get to ride a B-12?
The phone and TV ended with a green smell
I went from Oakland to Atlanta with my top down
$hort Dog, my shit is nation wide now
You can ask Breed or Pac it don't stop
I ain't bull shittin make a mill when I rock
Three players in the game and it's a major
Bitch you wanna get me better hit me on my pager
Today I'm on the westcoast
Tommorrow I'm in Texas
Flip the Benz and Farri, sold the Lexus
$horty drop the bass in the mix
You know what's next bitch
I'm sure to get rich

[Hook]

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Haha
I'd be the thuggin ass outlaw
Til my fuckin casket drops
Fuck around and make me blast on these bastard cops
This is for the hustlaaaaas
Believe me coming stapped with the gat
When you see me
Label me a threat to society, but I ain't quitin
Thug life motherfucker ain't no bull shittin
Born in these projects destined to fate
Collecting mail on these broke bitches
Slanging that game
Now shit done changed
It ain't the the same
I ain't lyin niggas are dyin
Three strikes have you motherfuckers flyin
In the penatentary or in the cemetary
Gettin high no need to worry
Last year niggas knockin up the block and in between shots
Pumpin tapes from that nigga Breed and Pac
This year bringin you the fix
Including Ant Banks in the mix
We're sure to get rich
Still I ride

[Hook]

[Verse 3: MC Breed]

I'm a cold-hearted fool
I mean a fool at heart, head strong
And I won't be headed home if he falls apart
Conatact niggas like a part time
When I ride the beat
Ain't no way to hide from the darkside
Man of many mens till the very end
And blend in and change my iden
Just to mix up with the game
They know me by the Breed and they don't know it's my last name
It's mind over matter
I don't mind, you don't matter
Pull a Glock and watch the whole block scatter
And we can have us a gat to gat talk
Do it old style and do a back to back walk
Count to ten and say goodbye to your friends
And we can put the bull shit to an end
I figure if he plays around he lays around
And he's a motherfucker goner, call a corner when I'm around
Bodies are buried and found all around
And parish and charish and thoughts just to be true
Punk, fellas behave ya and it just might save ya
So guard your girl and pickup your pistol
Cause you can't get wit Breed the weed head lyrical nit wit
The shit won't change as long as I'm alive
I gotta survive and keep it tight

[Hook]Intro : (Flavor Flav)

To the beat Ya'll

Ah yeah

(Ya don't stop) --] Flavor Flav

Sound good to me

[ VERSE 1: MC Breed ]
This sound hard, somethin' funky people gon' dance to
Give the record a second and a chance to
Hittin' people like a scene of amazement
While they slippin' back my feet is planted in the pavement
Crumble I can never do
So now I'm lookin' dead at you
What are you gonna do?
You listen to the knowledge of a scholar
You say "How Breed?" tell em how I holler
I'm the E Double, and I proclaim my name
Straight up good game, peeps all game
I'm like a rhino runnin' through the roughest pack
They figure I'm a trigga-happy nigga, so they step back
Breed, the microphonist
Boot last the longest
The noose's the strongest
It ain't a game, that's plain to see
You listen to the sounds of Breed (and the DFC)

There ain't no future in your frontin'

[ VERSE 2: MC Breed ]
I never got caught with a kilo
And if you ever do, yo, it will never be with me, yo
Servin' in a Cherokee or maybe it's a GTO
Black-on-black Benzo, I get it at [Name]
Never have to worry bout my posse gettin' jumped
Cause if we ever do, yo TB, pop the trunk
Cause we don't go for playin', when I play go grab a ball
When I'm on the mic I ain't for playin', not at all
Cause I clock 10 g's a week boomin' at my peak
Always seek E sober, but I do get geeked
I can give you a job, a place to eat hearty
Meet your homeboy Marty at a b.o.b. party
Takin' over, barkin' like a dog named Rover (woof!)
I'm pickin' suckers like a four-leaf clover
They're bitin' lyrics on the mic, I diss these cobras
So now they're sayin', "Eric Breed is gettin' over"

There ain't no future in your frontin'
Ha-ha-ha
There ain't no future in your frontin'

[ VERSE 3: MC Breed ]
I'm the B, the r to the double e-d and
Down with my homie G-a-s and O.E. and
Suckers causin' static, cause they still be disagreein'
I don't give a - cause I'm from F-l-i-n-t'n
A city where pity runs low
If you ever shoot through my city, now you know
Cause we are strictly business and we also got our pride
And if you don't like it, I suggest you break wide
Suckers steady lookin' for the m-o-n-e-y and
Thinkin' that illegal is the best way, so they dyin'
I ain't got time to see a fiend fiend out
To give up all his money, and he givin' what he got
That's the way I am, MC Breed cannot be different
Never change my ways for the world or the government
If I was the president, then I would state facts
You leave it up to me, I paint the white house black
It ain't no future in your frontin'

There ain't no future in your frontin'

[ VERSE 4: MC Breed ]
Yeah, I got dollars in my pocket, not from rollin'
If I was a fiend, then my gold would be stolen
Put my name Breed on everything I own
And when I get my jeep I'm puttin' 'Breed' on the chrome
Shine it up good, kickin' through my neighborhood
Motorola phone, fat rims and a Kenwood
Quick to get around it, and then I'll have it drop
Simply cause I'm ridin' people think I'm sellin' rocks
But ain't no future in your frontin'

Yo Flash man, drop that, man
Won't you drop that

(Keep on)
(To the beat ch'all)

[ VERSE 5: MC Breed ]
Cruel to the rules of the world
Live my life raw, cause I never liked the law
Wear top tens, on my ass use jeans
Sellin' big 8ths and tit-for-tat to the fiends
Clock much dollars, but I never break a sweat
Time to move out, my posse sayin' (bet)
You got my back, and I got yours
What time is it? Hm, Tear down the doors

Man
There ain't no future in your frontin'
Never was, cuz
There ain't no future in your frontin'

Hey man, let's start this party up, right?

(Beat y'all)
(Keep on)Ain't nuthin like pimpin just let it roll
Mother fucking shit god damn asshole
Ain't nuthin like pimpin just don't quit
Mother fuck you damn shithead bitch

My diamonds and the Lex say it's time to flow
Wonder how I got rich, they say I rhyme too slow, so
I'm from the "O" I for what I know
And like I told your ass before you can fuck my ho
I ride nuthin but vogues, ain't hittin no switches
Top down in my Caddy just me and my bitches
With a Ziplock bag full of green weed
I roll it all up cuz I'm a fiend in need
Of some dank smoke all up in my chest
Dangerous Crew got the bomb, we don't smoke that stress
Cuz we getting funky on album 9
I smoked a few joints bitch now I'm fine
Studio's in a cloud
Smelling kind of loud
Nuthin like pimpin
Nigga fuck Bill Clinton
Make me the mother fucking president
I'll make the White House a ho house and all the pimps, To just
Set up shops like they do in Vegas
Legalize pimpin for all the playa's
Puttin fine ass bitches in the streets and the hood
Every year a nigga trade for a new Fleetwood
You know I'm rollin, I can't be faking
I come through and all your hoes I'm taking
You know I'm rolling, don't do no simpin
I'm an Oaktown playa ain't nuthin like pimpin
Ain't nuthin like the pimp game you should know
Never love a bitch or a ho
You fell in love with her though trying to get in them pants
And the next thing ya know your baby momma's a tramp
Don't get mad now nigga want to shove the bitch
Cuz a year ago, you know, you loved the bitch
Now your stomache's upset and your feelings are hurt
She gotcha looking like an old banana peel in the dirt
Bitch, slipped up and hit your ass for a lick
Talking that mother fucking baby shit
You'z a punk ass nigga can't you see
Thatz the difference between niggas like you and me
I got bitches, on my mind
It's been like that for a real long time
I know the way them hoes take your cash
They let you fuck and make you pay up fast
Trick nigga, why you wanna be like that
Let them try for lent bitches take your fat ass stack
Couldn't tell them hoes nuthin but the punk in you
Cuz they already know what they want from you
Big bank, Ben Franklin, do the bitch just fine
She'll be taking all of yours and can't fuck with mine
I'm the M to the A to the C and K
All you playa hating niggas shouldn't be that way

There ain't nuthin like pimpin just let it roll
Mother fucking shit god damn asshole
Ain't nuthin like pimping just don't quit
Mother fuck you damn shit head bitch

Lights, camera, action, cut
Hollywood look out the bitch is coming up
She took acting classes 'bout to be on her way
On a Greyhound bus from home to L.A
She said it wouldn't take long to make it to the top
A few auditions land a job
I was down in L.A., hit the club for a drink
I'm a player ass nigga tell me what do ya think
I walked up to the bitch in my clean ass suit
And I told her, I've been watching you
I peeped you out from the bar
You must be a model or a movie star
She said "No, but that's my dream
To see my face on the movie screen"
I tell ya nothing but game came out my mouth
She was talking 'bout agents, I was turning her out
I said "Listen real close to what I'm saying
All you need is me; you don't need no agent"
I'm a pimp ass nigga and the game don't stop
"All you gotta do is fuck a few big shots
Cause if you can't do that, they're going to hold ya back"
She was sucking up the game, down to do all that
She said "Short baby, I ain't no simp"
But the nigga in the suit ain't nuthin but a pimp
And all them white guys you had sex with
They weren't big shots, they were nothing but tricks
She came to me and said it just won't last
I looked, and I laughed, and I kicked her ass
Cuz all she wanted was the fame
But you can't get shit when you don't have game

Guerilla pimpin just let it roll
Mother fucking shit god damn asshole
Guerilla pimps just don't quit
I say mother fuck you damn shithead bitch

Yea it's goin down for real now
It's your boy Breed and Prozak yea and Bootleg
This pain is going on inside me so what you know about us? (2x)

[Verse 1: MC Breed]
There's seven steps to my attic follow me in
Keep it simple like a violin
Fall in the pit- and then you try again
Try again for thinkin your shit can win
Cuz you a star livin in the monetary art
Till ten white uniforms break your jaw
Got you twisted, we had a real king but missed it
With all these trigga happy niggas actin like bitches
I'm sick, it got me fed up with shit
That's on the real you suckin on my skill like a dick
I ain't your family and you can't damage me
You know what I listen to your rap style and throw up
No blow up and show no real potential
You fake, but you got an instrumental
Now with this, let us redefine this word bitch
Cuz all these bitches I know they got dicks!

[Hook x4]
Bitches ain't shit, the scripts been flipped now
(Ya'll bitches ain't Shit!)

[Verse 2: Prozak]
We flip the script and bustin shots
Bustin clips and bustin Glocks
Bodies broken and fallin from brawlin
Niggas crawlin
Revenge and retaliation, mass murder extermination
No frontin' in your future, this 12 guage you're facin
I'm thinkin about the fact my mind is gone
Plottin battle plans like the Pentagon rockin it til the break of dawn
I'm knockin mother fuckers down like the twin towers
Me and Bootleg and Breed causin death showers
Still venemous with the flow Prozak's about to blow
Cock the hammer back let it go, get my dick sucked at the show
Enemies all engulfed in flames ,shotgun cocks when I blow your brains
911 when I inflict the pain, when I diss I say no names

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Bootleg]
I know that you jealous of me and my fellas you traitors
Bootleg's the storm that was born to crush all of you haters
So no hesitatin we eliminatin on Dayton
Follow my path in shadows and blood like Satan-
The year was 1992 when we were screamin fuck cops
Summertime, we on the grind, what's on my mind just dropped-
All I need is 1 mic- 2 dykes- 3 drinks and more-
Don't hate me bitch I done said that before!
Gettin tired of the okey dokey
Disrespect me in anyway I'll bust at your mama while she at kareoke
Cross Prozak once, and you'll die twice-
Fuck it, let me whipe my ass with your life...
Cuz bitch you ain't shit!!!

[Hook][MC Breed]
I'm in it witch'all (okay)
Hit big cash, I'll spend it witch'all
Win at the casino bitch, I'm spendin it all (hey)
Leave in my Spreewells spinnin for y'all
I'm in it for y'all, fact is (whattup)
My contents have character, plays the background
While I'm listenin to amateurs with no stamina (uh-uhh)
Compared to my flow
You're more or less recycled, career's on idle
Keep it comin though
If there's anyone or anybody that's potent enough, I wanna know
Gorilla, and I'm iller, than a fifth of
Hennessy and Belve', a big bagger killer
Popcorn popper, won't stop 'til I cop e-nough
Trees to get the whole world fucked up
I'm out of M-I, so when I say "Whatupdoe"
Y'all niggas put it on the flow

[Hook One: MC Breed]
Hey where you gettin it from, I want.. {one too}
Oh you got some of those, I got.. {one too}
You got a fine-ass broad, I got.. {one too}
And I'm drivin a Benz that get..
Oh you got one rolled, I got.. {one too}
And a fat bank roll, I got.. {one too}
You got a house on the hills, I got.. {one too}
And I'm drivin a Benz that get..

[MC Breed]
Uhh, nothin but that Cuervo Gold and Cold Coronas
Plug with them esse's that live in Arizona
Yeah, put it in your bubble nigga, know I'm on ya
Shake them haters off as soon as they get on ya
Popcorn, all through my perfecto
All I do is chief, it's hard for me to let go

[Proof]
Tecs blow like Del Rio - from the land
Of Air Force Ones, Detroit scum blow (cuatro cincos!)
If you want it, IF got it, the gettin is good
The best thing movin like a brick in the hood
I'm wishin you would stumble out the club
Fuck your slack (NIGGA) we can rumble out in floods
We fuck by choice but fight when we can
I'm good with the mic, but I'm nice with my hands
I ain't for bangin, unless the ass hangin
My last name ain't Kelly, but give me brain bitch, c'mon

[Hook Two: Proof]
The name of my crew is D.. {one-two}
You got some pills in your pocket, I want.. {one too}
You got a knock baby boy, I got.. {one too}
And I'm ballin on y'all like this is..
You got a Tab in your hand, I got.. {one too}
You got a gun on your waist, I got.. {one too}
You got a Roley on your wrist, I want.. {one too}
And I'm pullin my heat to get..

[Proof]
This is high octane that bang within block range
Nothin but cold blood flow in my hot veins
My shot aim with the pistol ain't the issue
Got the title, "Battle Disciple" came to diss you
Let's get to The Source with mics all I need black
Cause 5 mics together, only makes feedback
I'm what every rapper +dread+ like beeswax
Snatch a rapper out his Timbs like stems on weed sacks
(He's back!) Bitch, I never left
Every step has been Proof to the fact that I'm evidence
That Detriot co-co locos
The flame slow flow where the snow blow and they roll 'dro
My tendencies to spit, end MC's real quick
Pass they Hennessy sips, enemies get ripped
The penalty in vially, your memory dissolve
The energy is wild, mentally I'm foul
The entity now, howls instead of growl
Already raw, cookin lookin for shook ones to set 'em down
Don't worry about my record sales
(I know this ain't the same Proof that's in D12!)
Damn skippy, my hands swiftly grab a mic
Any man gifted stand with it, it's battle night
Soon as I get in the booth, spittin the truth
This ain't for the Billboards, this is strictly for you

[Hook One][MC Breed]
Ghetto E {*echo*}
Uh, Big Breed
Flashin', flashin'
I been flashin', flashin'
Flashin', flashin'
Come on

[Hook - MC Breed] 2x
Smokin' ounces of the good weed, we ball like dat
Hoes just love to page me, they call like dat
Drinkin' nothin' but the Henny nigga, y'all like dat
Don't fuck with one of us cause see, we all like dat

[MC Breed]
Why I oughta! (Don't do it dawg)
Fuck it, I'mma go there
Evidence of my residence is nowhere
I'll look for the address (what) I ain't impressed
I'll address you like "Bring somethin with you"
And "May the Lord bless you"
For real though, skills grow outta control
Forty beat him by the big bop four they done fold
Leave the bank account (why) but the safe work cool
And outta Flint and act the fool
I put it down for the record so you can sweat me if you wanna
Smell of the aroma, marijuana, uh, dig it
With the hammer cocked knowin' ya fuck
While to hit the block, pushin' rocks
With niggas I don't know and they might be cops
Aww fuck it, my kids gotta eat
Tonight, tommarow night, all next week, feel me
To wanna stop me is to kill me, I'm hoppin'
If they probably send the best feds to drill me, motherfuckers
Cause I'm clean when they see me on the streets nowadays (why)
Cause nowadays niggas are warned and chains
That nigga gone blow, I seen him at the sto'
Tellin' them motherfuckers to get down on the flo'
You know how this shit go, before we hit the do'
{*gun clicks*} just so end up by the .44
Drama, and that's just why your mama can't stand me
I go to Ghetto Theater's to get my Ghetto Grammy

[Hook - MC Breed] 2x

[Shoestring]
Motherfucker, you be lyin' put you on a strecher
When them thugs test that ass, bitch they couldn't catch ya
You was runnin' for your life, prudent and prime gurdle
Even seen it on the news, you didn't miss a hurdle
You've been scooped by a grouch, you got busted balls
And that mess you used to have, now it's pussy walls
So save that killin' shit you talkin' for them outta states
Cause in my city and yo' city, bitch you known to break
So who the fuck you think you foolin' you's a small baller
Shoestring and Ghetto E the fuckin' shot callers
Niggas dacin' in this shit like dope fiends
If you beef, or have some killers on your fuckin' team
Cause if you don't motherfucker then you ass out
You let 'em get you for your goods and your glass house
But you rap about you bustin' niggas in they chest
And rollin' niggas up like onions or buddha zest
You big ballin' like a motherfucker let you tell it
It's a pussy in this bitch and a nigga smell it
You wanna fuck me, motherfuckin' nigga catch these knuckles
You played out like the motherfuckin' hang buckles
Shoestring loose in this motherfucker bring the drama
Got no love for your ass nigga, fuck your mama
So when you see me put your back up against the wall
My name is Shoestring bitch, I'm known to ball
Big ball, is what I do!

[Hook - MC Breed] 2x

[Ghetto E]
{*yawn*}
I woke up, pissed some herb, jumped in the shower
Told my niggas to come and scoop me in an hour
It's summertime, eighty-seven degrees
In the candy coated Cutlass on gold-D's
Hit the switches, saw some bitches in short skirts
Spillin' Remi, fuckin' up the Nautica shirts
But the Planet Rock Sony system was poundin'
Throwin' gang signs, mean muggin' niggas and clownin'
Smokin' Killa, my nigga Breed broke out the stash
It's a party at the beach that we 'bout to crash
Mad bitches at the beach, I felt like I'm dreamin'
Sun-rays hit my diamonds and got 'em gleamin'
Volleyball in the sand but we ain't playin'
Only came to eat and drink, cause that's how we layin'
Five o'clock beach closed, now we just lerkin'
No more Remi so we started erkin' and jerkin'
Still early, eleven-thirty, time to hit the club
Club jumpin', DJ bumpin' that "I Don't Want No Scrubs"
It's delicious, gettin' kisses from every ho I see
'Til they close we poppin' Mo's in the V.I.P
Head to Hunter's, dressin' sleppin' to watch the QB's ball
On the stage bad bitches doin' the booty-call
Tellin' bitches if you come with my clique you screwin'
(Ay, so what cha'll doin tonight)
Breed tell these hoes what we doin'

[Hook - MC Breed] 2xVerse One: Erick Sermon

Whoo! Ah ah, ayahh, ahh ahh ahh
And you don't stop, ahh ahh, word is bond, word is bond
Now introducing the sound from the ghetto
E Double and Too $hort, what the fuck you thought?
I come with the ruckus, It's My Thing when I swing
I'm Born to Mack, always strapped, with the black gat
Who out there I swear boy wanna get touched
Roll up, and catch a slug to the chest, so DUCK
I talk the talk, walk the walk, now nigga
Five hundred S drivin with hand on trigger
Crazy Lestat, check my track record
Everything I touch is gold since eighteen years old
So what that mean? I roll the blunt
And puff the indo smoke in it, I trip in a minute
Crazy holy doctor holdin me cuz I be rockin B
Sewin up like Monopoly, nobody's stoppin me
Dig it, Funkdafied like Brat, how's that?
I stick and move on tracks while I smoke a twenty sack
Who said the E can't rock? That's bullshit
Suck my dick and get a big fat lick of my balls
You wanna brawl? Punk I thought not
You might get beat down and stomped like Sasquatch
Your girl, like Keith Sweat, I wanna fuck her
Psych, I already stuck her
I got rhymes to make your whole head swell up
Here's an icepack homeboy shut the hell up
I rock the mic with Too $hort, y'all niggas know what's happenin
Everything he touch goes platinum
Eyeeaaaah!

Verse Two: Too $hort

I made a half a million in a week
And every nigga on the street got a tape playin me
You can't believe it? Erick Sermon, rollin with $hort
Rolled from California all the way to New York
In big Benzes, G-50 up
Now we trying to squash all that East/West stuff
We spent years in the studio makin funky tracks
Signed a bunch of niggas with some tight ass raps
It's like Father Dom, it's like Keith Murray
Makin millionaires but it ain't no hurry
Cuz we all in it for the long run
I won't leave the studio until a song's done
And ain't nuthin really hard about gettin my cash
A big phat house with a million stash
You other niggas got this rap game distorted
Givin DATs to the label, straight gettin shorted
Claim you're gettin paid, but I can't tell
You keep rappin in my ear got me mad as hell
You talk a good game but I don't believe in you
Be smokin lotta blunts but I got more weed than you
I guess I see you on the charts in the meanwhile
Another face in the crowd plus some freestyle
Wishin you could be in the light
Promoters pay me ten G's just to breathe on the mic
Bitch! $hort Dawg puttin it down with the E Double

Verse Three: Erick Sermon

Shhhhh! You remind me of my phat gold chain
Some of y'all are just small change
Be a boss with true true game
Yeah yeah
Dig this y'all, my Music is Dangerous
Atomic Dog, coming through the smog with $hort Dawg
Ahhh! Quick with the trig Jack be nimble
I shoot like G Mob goes liftin through my window
Chik chik pow! How you like me now?
The man in the mirror it don't get no clearer
$hort Dawg, the E Double, and Breed we roll thick
Like girls in C.A.U. with the good power-U
Owww! Money is the key to fame
So I can live it up with the girls on Soul Train
The impact, major league dough like Dave Justice
Yo Breed, $hort Dawg, show em how we bust this

Verse Four: Too $hort, MC Breed, Kool Ace

Like some true pioneers, don't forget it
Put the money on the table, let's split it
We got enough G's here to make us both happy
Tell them fans we ain't runnin no coke factory
It's $hort Dawg the real pimp of the century
Girls get wet every time somebody mention me
I was known for my mackin back in eighty-four
I want it all, that's what I keep stackin for
Have things that a rapper never dreamed of havin
And I can tell them how to get it just keep rappin
Life's a battle, headed for the new sun
So many ways to get paid, you got ta choose one
Now some of the ways to get paid out is runnin your mouth
That street life will keep me tight, I'm talkin bout
Gettin green, dolla dolla bills y'all
That's on the real, somethin you can feel y'all
Many claim to have game but you can get that on sale
But ain't nuthin they sellin to you but Arbor and Gail
I mean Sprinkle Me homey cuz I'm bout dollars and cents
And if you ain't haulin dollars well you ain't holler
In FlintI'd rather dip dip dive, so-socialize
Get loot from the Great Lakes, West to Eastside
You tramp, trick, HACH I spit
Undergrade if you ain't gettin paid like this
The hours of the ATL paves my name
Spittin Mr. Macker izzer are you still in the game
See I gets paid by the movement of the cut
I've been summoned by the cancer, to testify and bless
It's that, big mack, like scripture is a phat Kodeje?
So hide your ho from me
Southern am-bassador, knockin at your door
Leadin a click that's true, checkin knowin all fifty-two
See, all you tricks, best behave
It's that Southern nigga mack from the city of the Brave
I got the platinum caul, yes yes y'all
So plant me with the green and them hoes and we can big ball
Yeah, now we rollin four deep
Double dosin, relaxin, and maxin to $hort and these beats
E Double, $hort Dawg, Kool Ace
In the place, and be all but bring you straight horror
Representin money
Buy you some nigga[2Pac yelling]

Guess who's back
Guess whos' back muthafucka, big ballin' ass muthafuckin' Breed
Givin' you what ya need, yea, smokin' a gang of weed
Hit them fools nigga

[MC Breed]

Come one, come all
Niggas get the beat down
Retreat, creep, or feel the heat of the Breed sound
Collect facts, then attack like I'm suppose to
Ya boy's goin', lef', on niggas and them hoes too
It's me, that nigga who ain't never got caught
My mic is wounded, I'ma test it with a touch of salt
Keep a book of the mark ass niggas I broke
Cause big Breed, can do ya while I'm smokin' my dope, try an' cope
Catch up as this shit gets mental, this chronic got me workin' my brain
I need a pencil
So I can shake and change the style, but in the meanwhile
I maintain the crowd
Make moves to improve, so I can build a bigger rep
The trigger finger strapped, I wanna see another nigga step
I play the cards, lost by your dingy mista Gillagan
The mighty mad writer's straight up Comin' Real Again

[2Pac yelling]

Buck buck muthafucka. Right at your muthafuckin' ass
This shit too strong for a muthafuckin' vest
So watch your chest and your dome
Leave Breed the fuck alone
We sendin' niggas to the fuckin' cemetery

[Breed]

They got me thinkin'. Sittin' in the hot spot
I'm straight up havin' hard times wanting me a drop top
And a fat knot, and I ain't tryin' to hear that 5-0 shit
I'm black, and I was born with a survival kit, uh
Ain't shit but spit, in the beer that I'm drinkin'
I gotta get paid, I gotta get paid, and that's what a nigga be thinkin'
You sleep hoes, I'm puttin' a peep holes
In your forehead. Run till your toes is numb, go test your broke head
Breed's got niggas at your back once again punk
Told you ain't no future in that shit, but you still front
When will they realize, I got the feel again
The mighty mad writer's Comin' Real Again

[2pac yelling]

Buck buck biiinnng
That's the motherfuckin' sound as we buckin' mothafuckas down
Yea nigga, run but you count out race this motherfuckin' bullet
Breed, pull it. They can't fade you boy

[Breed]

Once mo', toe to toe? I don't think so
Bird sales, and knockin' niggas out like Riddick Bowe
You ain't the play, you know the play so don't say shit
Get 'em up and find your ass gettin' up off the pavement
Wavin' the shit, beggin' niggas to just straight quit
But fuck that, a hard head can get a niggas ass kicked
I ain't lettin' up for none...son
I'm Comin' Real Again

[2Pac yelling]

Yea motherfucka how you wanna play this shit?
We can go toe to toe, Glock for Glock, block for block
Homie to muthafuckin' homie
But you muthafuckas gonna feel this nigga this time
Cause we ain't comin' back with that old bullshit
There's too many muthafuckin' dead niggas for me to be takin' this here bullshit
That's why there's muthafuckas in the pin now, nigga
So pull or quit that bullshit, cause I don't wanna hear that muthafuckin' crap
Comin' Real Again nigga, thought I told you muthafuckas, I thought you knew
It's the muthafuckin' real shit muthafucka. 100 percent authentic
Type of shit you fuckin' get chronic'd out to, you know what I'm sayin'?
So do me one of them muthafuckin' favors, and light another fuckin' blunt
You know what I'm sayin'? A blunt muthafucka. Philly style
You know what I'm sayin'? Chronic nigga!
I'm talkin' 'bout laid out, played out, phat fuckin' funk
Yea this that type shit we kickin' in the 9 tre muthafucka
So all you muthafuckin' big ballin' ass gangstas
You put your muthafuckin' hand on yo' gat
And if the police roll up and say turn it down, you burn it down muthafucka
Cause we Comin' Real Again. 19 nigga 3, boy. Real again. We grabbin' steel
Again, cause we Comin' Real Again. We turn the 90's to the 60's muthafucka
That's how we rollin'[Hook](x2)
They say I'm crazy, and I don't give a fuck
Goose in the cup, 40 by the nuts
Crazy (lay a nigga down like what)
Cause they don't know nothing 'bout me

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
Trice is the truth, puncture your roof
If what I enunciate ain't getting through you
Listen nigga, School Craft raised me
Hey bay-bay, you don't wanna fucking play with me
I got the K covered up in the back
Got the pistol on my side nigga, O stay strapped
Stacks in the jeans, this is a natural thing
I don't act out a movie, I'm actually the scene
I pull up on the scene, nigga holla back
With a bad bitch Italian and black
They don't take double takes, they take Kodaks
Coast through the club relaxed, where the V.I.P. at
Coast under the cub, post underneath the duds
Supposed to, I'm a motherfucking thug
But they say he crazy cause he don't give a fuck
First nigga play me, light his ass up

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
[Obie Trice]
Yeah I'm crazy, the hood made me
So O abide by the code on the daily
Niggas get it twisted, bitches get it twisted
Cause I live like unrealistically
Ay, my nigga Breed in the booth with me
Motor City 'til them pall-bearers dig me
Underneath the soil
Ain't no future in your fronting, nigga I'm Detroit loyal

[MC Breed]
Oh so what you know karate? I know crazy
Hit you with something, leave your left side lazy
Coming for the whole shebang, yup, believe that
Take it like I want it, get behind ya like I need that
'Til I get more "Wassup's" than Martin
Get drunk, come through, bust up the party
Tonight, very night, Breed and Obie Trice
You say our ass crazy, yeah you motherfucking right

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Obie Trice]
Say I need Ritalin, cause when the choppers start riddling
Bodies start dropping, disappearing
Tempers start flaring, nigga nutting up
Ain't no coming back from that bruh
Ay, bad days some faggot in a bag
Give a fuck what neighborhood you at
What Dilla dick you sucking, when the pistols bucking
Lord knows someone family's suffering
And I ain't the nigga that'll start the beef
I lay back, I ain't got a problem with G
But lick her and niggas like twelve hits of E
Suicidal, somebody on their way to meet Jesus
These demons keep chasing me
Get away from me, or the AK speaks
No wonder why they see him as a freak
Say he crazy, in the motherfucking street

[Hook][Hook]
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours X2
I gotta get mine
Get yours

[Verse 1: MC Breed (2Pac)]
Aiyyo I'm Smooth as I wanna be, for pussy you's a gonna, G
(Oh, that's the way it is?)
Fuck yeah and that's the way it's gonna be
(Why), puffin up on tha dank and drinking mad brew
Taking names and after that I'm kickin ass too
Breed, time to flow (can I get a rhyme to go)
Hell yeah, Pac, I'll sit back, straight up design it slow
They hate to see a young nigga, (come up)
Another punk, (run up) and have to get his, (gun up)
Cause um I ain't takin no shots
Like a Newport fort, exploitin the floor like Jordan
Explodin on the hoop court.
And I don't wanna be, I-don't-wanna-be nuttin like Mike
Cause even Mike was like it's a itsy bitsy wet triflin
And when you in the spotlight, you get um jocked right
But your knot's not tight
Buckin anybody who fuck wit' mine
When will they realize? I'm straight out to get mine

[Hook] - 6X

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
I keep my mind on my money, money on my mind
Finger on the trigger, nigga, hand on my nine
Smokin blunts a skunk, makin holes in punks
And only underground funk pumpin outta my trunk
Live the life of a hustler: high till I die;
Meetin bitches, gettin riches, miss me with lies
Picture me living out my life as a busta
I'd rather pop out a shot from my Glock, and blast motherfuckers
I live the thug life, baby, I'm hopeless
Chokin off indo trying to keep my focus
Don't let that bullshit worry me
Fuck the fame, I'm true to the game 'til they bury me
God gave me game so I'm hustlin
Pour out some liqour for my niggas, 2Pac is still strugglin!
My nigga Breed knew the time
Whether it's rhyme or crime, nigga, I gotta get mine

[Hook] - 6X

[Verse 3: MC Breed]
Now, tell me
Can you measure the amount of applause I keep gettin?
Everytime I pick up a mic and start spittin
The sidewalks of New York will start bumpin
Jumpin around, with the motherfuckin pound
And I'm down to the fullest, and breakin niggas ass off proper
Did I shock you, cause I got you in my pocket again
Them new jacks and you jacks
Who knew me and my niggas, when I used to run it way back when
I boasted, and roasted, and coasted to the pinnacle
Because of what I do with a pen
It's vernacular precision
Connect the two lines and it's division
Plus, when I add lutes and flutes
It's guaranteed to sell like prostitutes
I never had love for hoes who put it blunt
And want me in the back, but, bitch, I'm in the front!
Don't front, and really I don't need a reply
Pull yourself together as you pass me by
I'm on a whole another level, them hoes is left
I told you before, keep ya pussy to yourself
Goodbye, some many niggas lied to have
Funny what a motherfucker do for math
I got fractions caught up in my everday actions
Point equal to your real satisfaction
Buckin anybody who fuck wit' mine
When will they realize, I'm straight out to get mine haha

[Hook] - 6X1-2, 1-2
Yeah
My name is MC Breed
I'm down with DJ Flash Technology, right?
And what we're doin here together as a team, the true-doers
Is what we call
Kickin it
Ah-ha, I said
We kickin it

[Verse 1: MC Breed]
Da-bigga-da-bigga-da-bigga-da-bigga-da-bigga
Da-bigga-da-bigga-da-Back in '86 when I started this
I said, the people told me: "Breed, you're not an artist"
But now it's 1990, I'm servin em well
With the rhymes, rhythms, style and clientele
Concert after concert, one after the other
A man with the plan, plus a hustler undercover
A president, a guy of his own
Said, I knew I was proper, and I knew I was strong
But all it takes is concentration, rhyme calculation
Enough crew members to carry a nation
To be exact, yo Jack, I rehearsed
The cat wants your tongue, but I be catchin it first
And I'm kickin it

(Ah yeah)

[ VERSE 2: MC Breed ]
Said, it's real necessary, not lack of control
To be at the tip-top with nothin but bankroll
To develop an actual skill, son
You gotta be born a natural real one
Not high up on a pedestal, just a born idol
To me it's just a typical man-made title
To remain an architect and stand, in fact
You're startin to sweat, to eject is your best bet
Certified legal, not against the law
I'm not irrelevant, but terribly raw
I got on-the-job knowledge and puttin it on paper
No bun for those who b.s. the baker
That's right, the mack Eric Breed is all that
It's pretty simple, not to mention a fact
Causin major upsets for you so-called vets
Who was there in the beginning, now you're sittin in check
I'm kickin it

(Ah yeah)
Yeah, I'm kickin it

Now this beat is so dope
Yo Flash, get busy one time
Uknowmsayin?

[ VERSE 3: MC Breed ]
Nigga-da-nigga-da-nigga-da-ni...
Not once do I think I need to change my mind
Technology's here with me to co-sign
Yeah, for the occasion, Breed's invasion of death force
Sit back, relax, Techno cuts of course
Yo, the B-r-double e-d, and it's me
]From the city of F-l-i-n-t with Technology
Servin on the wheels of steel and we're real
And if you squeel you're killed, pimp, that's the deal
Big Breed, I'm servin at the top of my mind
But his wax is just like 'jax, so then grind
It's like MC Kickin-It, one time like this and that
Step back, Jack, goin black for black
Yeah, not wearin a Kangol, but maybe a cable
Thick shades, now you know, no lookin like Kool Moe
Yo, the rhyme that I'll be kickin will collect
D-d-d-all respect, so why should I fess?
And I'm kickin it

Da-bigga-da yeah
Huh, and I'm kickin it

(Ah yeah)[Rappin' 4-Tay]
You see you never talk down on a playa, I'll spray ya
Then break it down to your knee, you best to say a prayer
This funk been a part of my life ever since the startin' gate
Remember me and my nigga $hort Dog way back in '88?
Broke them bitches down with some sexual healing
And man the town ain't been the same since "Don't Fight the Feelin'"
But now your new booty, stayed off in this game on a accident
Copied another niggas style
Punk don't let this rap shit get you broke off
Cause see it's potent like that ain't right
Find a maiden name for yourself, but don't believe the hype
Fool, who you think opened the door for your producer?
If it wasn't for the Dog and them hogg's you wouldn't have a future
And let me add that I could never be scared of ya
Rappin' 4', born and raised off in that Bay Area
Stickin' to that ass like a hot bowl of grits
Hits on top of hits, who you think started this shit?

[Hook]
Never talk down on a playa
Unless you're ready to be straight labeled as a hater
Save a - bitch in a minute for a nut
It's the 4' and the Dog
Got you fiendin' with this funk, nigga
Never talk down on a playa
Unless you're ready to be straight labeled as a hater
Save a - bitch in a minute for a 'what?'
It's the 4' and the Dog
Got you fiendin' on this funk, nigga

[Too $hort]
It's goin' down right now, California mackin' at its best
Somethin' for my niggas on the grind from the West
Cali is my home but its just like yours
Niggas love to get money while they fuck they whores
Hit all the parties, and do the same old shit
Bitches gettin' broke cause the game don't quit
I had a flashback, it was the Oakland Raiders at the Coliseum
We ain't nothin' but players - diamonds glistenin', hoes whistlin'
Bitches know my name cause it's a natural thang
I had to bend a corner, really didn't wanna - punk you's a goner
Heard you was on a - stick up mission, triple-beam in the kitchen
Never shot nobody but I'm damn sure itchin' to blast you
Cause in your dream you shot me
Then you woke up and found out you can't stop me

[Hook]
You see you never talk down on a playa
Unless you're ready to be straight labeled as a hater
Save a - bitch in a minute for a nut
It's the 4' and the Dog
Got you fiendin' on this funk, nigga
Never talk down on a playa
Unless you're ready to be straight labeled as a hater
Save a - bitch in a minute for a 'what?'
It's the 4' and the Dog
Got you fiendin' on this funk, beotch

[Rappin' 4-Tay]
If buckin' a motherfucker on the mic be a crime
Best believe the police got a APB out on mine
Because I gots more disguises than that fool Inspector Gadget
I'm not a witch, but crystal ball let me have it, ahh
I seen playa hatin' way back from the gate
Now everybody wanna be a P-L-A-Y-A
Why lie to yourself and play the role as a simp?
Knowin' damn well your bitch bought "Shorty the Pimp"
Because they smile in your face
And all the while them motherfuckers wanna take your place

[Too $hort]
That's right 4', we from the old school
Been doin' shows, been comin' tight in studios
Songs on the radio, interviews, and laughs
Up at the mall signin' autographs
And ain't nothin' gon' change in '96
Cause this pimp gotta mack all the finest bitches
And get paid from the game
So they never talk down on a playa's name

[Hook]
You never talk down on a playa
Unless you're ready to be straight labeled as a hater
Save a - bitch in a minute for a nut
It's the 4' and the Dog
Got you fiendin' on this funk, nigga
Never talk down on a playa
Unless you're ready to be straight labeled as a hater
Save a - bitch in a minute for a 'what?'
It's the 4' and the Dog
Got you fiendin' on this funk, beotch

[MC Breed]
4-Tay, Short Dog, and Breed like this, check me out now
Never that, run it back, sayin' Breed is hatin' you
Takin' you to another level nigga makin' you
And got plenty hoes in the back screamin' "okay!"
Breed fuckin' 'round with 4-Tay
Ice like T out to get payed
$hort Dog bringin' hoes to the pimpery
I - be faded off this Tanqueray daily
Niggas wanna play me but plenty of bitches pay me
Over all I balls more and none test
I keep a gun and I put two off in a niggas chest
And see coincide within the same heartbeat
That's right, now give a motherfucker five feet
Further imformation, I get into meditation
I oughta have yo' ass shakin', I conclude my calculation is -

[Hook] - X 2
You never talk down on a playa
Unless you're ready to be straight labeled as a hater
Save a - bitch in a minute for a nut

Unless you're ready to be straight labeled as a hater

(Bootleg)
And I got dollars in my pocket not from rollin'
Since I'm not a fiend the my jewlery never stollin'
Puttin' "Bootleg" on everything I own
My white Navigator, 8 twelves on chrome

But I'm still bugged nothin' but slugs for me mugs
Me and 3-6 tearin' up the club anybody violate the family is gettin' drugged
Bootleg who said he can flow like I, I doubt it
Besides that fact Relativity won't allow it
You can borrow my style but please bring it home
Cause my style be missin' its owner when I'm gone
Ain't no future in your frontin'

(Chorus) x2[Ice Cube]
One, two, three and I come with the wicked

Ha ha, yeah, what's up?

Well I know, I got the wrong motherfuckin' house
Did somebody beap me from there?

[George Clinton]
Colors don't clash, people just do
Color me happy next to you
Aww, just like it should, there goes the Neighborhood
That is what they'd have us believe

[Hook: George Clinton]
Paint the White House black, brown
Paint the White House..
(*Sample of Police Sirens*)
Paint the White House black, brown
Paint the White House, black...

[George Clinton]
Uhhhh lookin' through a view of views
Seein' what they want you to
Blinded by the flames of friendly fire
And then they sat there like a dope
Until they choked from all that smoke
From behind a smoke screen of the patriotic liars

[Dr. Dre]
Aiyyo, well check this out
If you talked to George Clinton
Tell him I'll catch him at the next plateau with the bomb
You know what I'm sayin?
It's not the pretendo but the endo
And I'll be droppin' some straight Chronic at his front door

[Hook: George Clinton with Ice Cube and Pupa Curley]
Paint the White House black, brown
Paint the White House..
(Cause white ain't right, so get the flashlight)
Paint the White House black, brown
(No matter what creed, no matter what color)
Paint the White House..

[Chuck D]
Yo yo Flavor man, we could kick like this
Yo, we could kick it man, yo, word up, man
Yo, check this out man
You know, the homeboys in Detroit, in Minneapolis, in L.A
In New York and down in D.C. man
They got the system in the back and boomin' it
But they don't know what we're sayin'
But the homeboys know what we're sayin'
You know what I'm sayin?
Yo, check Yo-Yo

[Yo-Yo]
If love ain't got nothin' to do with it then keep it
Ain't no big secret, we all know the reason
People change everyday but life stays the same
One big game, ain't a damn thing changed
A woman's got to do what a woman's got to do
Be a mackstress, don't let these mackers mack you
So I get caught up in it, I'm stressin' and tired
The man who runs the joint gets me higher
It can be a White House, a black house
It can be a crack house, an out house
If it ain't the right house, go get your army gears baby
We got a fight, they ain't gonna set aside another night
(*Sample of Police Sirens*)
It's so bad that Los Angeles, is so scandalous
Give me somebody, who can handle us
Yo-Yo is on the top of things
So uhh.. color me mad, I'm ready for a change

[MC Breed]
I done came up short, one time too many
Yet a brother got to be comin' out his nickles
And countin' up his last pennies
Buyin' brushes and bum rushin' homey's greenery
Many envy but a hill of beans is what it means to me
Leave it up to me, I'm paintin' the White House black
There ain't no future in your frontin'
So why the hell you're frontin' jack?
It'll either change or we're gonna change it
"Yeah, it's gettin' old"
Usin' everything, from spray cans to charcoal
Put them up, then put the crew up on discharge
Leavin' wet paint signs in the front yard

[Flavor Flav]
Yo George, these people crazy man
They don't even know what I'm sayin'

[George Clinton]
Awwwwww airbrushed and colorized
Just changed right before our eyes, real as visualized
In every frame and let the love shine from the right house
Be in the black, red or white house
Through our fear the puppeteer can pull our strings
Whoaahh, well alright, again I say or say can you see
The puppeteer pull the strings of you and me from the White House
The out house of territorial conquest
The HUD House, the pro-this, the anti-that
White against black, the right to life versus pro-choice

[KAM]
I pledge allegiance to the flag
Being all I could never be.. KAM READ HIS TOE TAG
Yeah, this is USA-K all day and you can't interrupt
Lay back, WATT'S UP
Stars and stripes for Tarzan types
Got brothers like me behind bars and on pipes
Damn, I'm gettin' took for a trip
They got me seein' stars from the club and stripes from the whip
Why must you all be like that?
I ain't into politics, so skip them white-collared tricks
They never did us no good
To hell with the space shuttle, put some money in the hood
And make jobs, let's mob up to the capitol
Then we ain't got to rap at all
Power To The People and the only way to get free
Is the J-to-the-U-S-T-I-C-E

[George Clinton w/ KAM]
Picture this, paint a picture, picture perfect, paint a perfect picture
Y'all can't stop the bum rush, so get the paint brush
It's time for a change
Paint the White House black, brown

[Dr. Dre]
Yo, listen to the real Clinton "WHO BILL CLINTON?"
Hell no, I'm talkin' about George Clinton

[George Clinton]
Paint the White House black, brown

[Pupa Curley]
All one blood, only a different color
And in a dis ya time, you have to help your neighbor
Look at the downtown area, no food to eat, no shelter
Them people have to live in a house made of paper
And when it rains it falls through like a sift wire
Hunger deh hunger, all over about time
All of us come together
Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, N.W.A, Flavor Flav, Chuck D
Public Enemy, Flea, Anthony stirrin' up the Chili
Yo-Yo, KAM and Breed, Prince and Pupa that's me

[Ice Cube]
One, two, three and I come with the wicked
Boom boom boom with the Bop Gun, looks like I dropped one
You can get with this or you can get with it
Got to peel his cap, who's the mack?
Shit, I'll paint the White House black

[Hook: George Clinton & Pupa Curley]

[George Clinton]
Picture this, paint a picture, picture perfect, paint a perfect picture

[George Clinton]
Paint the White House black, brown
Those who oppose to be leveled up next to this
I ain't the devil, this ain't The Exorcist
Worse than a nightmare, you don't have to sleep on wink
The pain the mind gets everytime you think
Flashbacks, interfere, you start to hear
P-Funk in your ear

[Dr. Dre]
Ha yeah, what's up?
This is Dr. Dre callin' from Chronic Control
Peace and hair grease, I'm ouuuuuuut!

Damn!!

[Flavor Flav]
Aiyyo, 'Dre was Panasonic, what's up now?[MC Breed talking]
Hey check this out Short, you know what I'm saying?
Yeah you down here in Oakland, you know what I'm saying?
And I'm all up in Michigan, you know what I'm talking about? I need
To get up on my pimpin, you know what I'm talking bout? I need to be
A player nowadays you know what I'm saying? Niggas need to know how
To play these hoes you know what I'm saying? On the strength, why dont you put me up on that pimpin shit?

[Short Dawg]
I do it like the best of the greatest, not the worst
Like welfare day, can't stop the first of the month
Can't stop Short Dawg neither
Got a good ho niggas sure better keep her
Cause I'm on the prowl, all the time
Tryin knock every bitch so they all be mine
And I ain't never, ever gone change my ways
Drop a few lines, leave a bitch in a daze
Have her homegirls wonderin what she do
Fucked around and gave me that pussy too
I be doin this shit on a regular basis
Got bitches everywhere in all kind of places
I can pull out my little black phone book
Flip every last page take a long look
Than pull out a bitch, like a rabbit out a hat
Nigga if I want, I can have it like that
Fuck two or three bitches at the same time
Grab the microphone sing my rhyme
About them same three bitches that fucked me good
Us niggas gotta do what the fuck we should when we want to
I might pass it
So get butt naked, shake that ass bitch
I'm bout as real as the stones in my diamond rings
You can hate my guts, but I'm gone do these things, bitch

[MC Breed and (Too Short) talking]
Like that Short? Uhh, can't take shorts just cause your name Short
Matta fact Imma quit taking shorts man
(Spit a little game to em Breed)

[MC Breed]
Ahhh why have a nine, when I can have a ten
If she ain't Lickin up the nuts, while I'm gone holler at her friend
Bitch, ain't no time for me to teach her
Rather have an everyday ho, that umm knows how to treat a nigga
Thinkin if she ain't lickin me up
I'm givin her to Short, cause he don't give a fuck
Do yourself a favor and quit callin my house
If you really don't want this nigga to put this dick in your mouth
Umm, have you seen my bitch?
I ain't seen her, but if I do she gets dick
That's what I'm givin her just like that
To the front and back, nothing but the bozack
The second she get lonely, feelin she can get her money
And she run to fuck her own ignorant homey
You a lost cause, yellin pause when they drop the draws
Its's entrapment, have yo nigga breakin nigga laws
But it ain't a matter of mentality, it's reality
Open your eyes, realize bitches ain't nothin but a casuality
But a factor to a nigga wanting fuckin time
She's just an everday, don't wanna catch her fuckin mine
Bitch ain't mine, so I thought you knew this
Bitch this is how I do this

[Mc Breed talking]
Short I know you ain't done explaining, you know what I'm saying?
Pimpin is an all american sport, you know what I'm saying? A lotta
People and got that down pat yet but uh why dont you explain it out for em

[Short Dawg]
You can call eight ball in the corner when you shootin pool
But when you play the game of life, ain't no stupid rules
Gotta go for yours at all times
Cause if you don't, nigga yours will be mine
And I won't go to bed early, won't sleep too late
And I'll never take a punk ass bitch on a date
They say Too Short baby why you talk so bad?
Just a player ass nigga and that's all I rap about
Bitches, hoes and all that shit
She got my number, if she beep me I might call the bitch
And go diggin in them guts like a gardener
If she starts screamin, I'm gone fuck the ho harder
Just havin fun with the bitch, as she sprung on my dick
Guess I'll pull it out and just cum on the bitch
And from New Year's Day to New Year's Eve
And everyday in between I will do these things, I don't stop bitch

[Mc Breed talking]
Hahahaha, that nigga Short, uh uh yeah uh

[MC Breed]
I like to go to the club mix and mingle
Nigga plays his dick like a 12 inch single
Yeah, so what you bitches wanna do?
Step to me you gots to do my crew, first
When I rehearse I change rearrange
My mentality will bring you to reality
You on me like cologne 'til now
I feel it's time for us to bone
So I look and pimp the background
Look, listen put the bitch on lockdown
Yeah you hangin out with me tonight
Everythings alright, but a nigga wanna fight
Damn, that's a real player hater for ya
Fuck it, I'll be waitin for ya

[Father Dom]
I'm droppin lines like a mother fuckin pimp at this shit
I'm gettin hoes out they clothes cause I'm good at this shit
They callin me the pussy jammer cause I'm breakin hoes off
See I'm paid to be boss, I'm kickin back at no cost
Never slackin, just mackin, money stackin that's my motto
With so much game they want to play me like the lotto
Tip the bottle, now I'm drunk as a skunk
High off the dank, but I can't front
See I'm never being senile
See I'm smooth as a nail on a fingernail file
Keepin it wild, but in the meanwhile we the coolest
Sure enough this how we do this

[2Pac]
I'm fingerfuckin' with my diamonds
Now peep a nigga climbin' the charts
Ain't no fear in my heart, I represent it from the start
Deep, my momma raised me as a G from birth
Be a hustlin' motherfucker 'til I sees my hearse
No doubt, I bust a shot for all my niggas in jail
All the young black males, that gotta slang yayo
Cause it's a hard life nigga only thugs survive
Ain't no love, unless a nigga slangin' drugs or high
Conversations with these bitches on my mobile
Always in control and never let these bitches know you
And even though I'm gettin high, a thug nigga gettin by
Catchin' bitches spittin' lies, I'm gettin' mine
All day, I puff a blunt and parlay and sometimes if we party
Gettin my dick licked twice
And death to a trick's life, we can pursue this 'til my shit's right
Went from havin' fantasies, to havin' hoes leave they man for me
There is no realer man than me
The city of Oaktown laced me with my first case
When them punk police tried to break me
Didn't think the shit was cute, so I got a lawsuit
And made them punk police buy my coupe
This is how we do this[ Night & Day ]
I ain't much too worried about the past
(Past)
Worried about the past
(Yeah
That's the way I like it
Laid back, just like that
Now what that music feel like?)
I ain't much too worried about the past
Ain't too much worried
Worried about the past
Ain't too much worried 'bout the past
I ain't much too worried about the past
Ain't too much worried
Worried about the past
Ain't too much worried 'bout the past

[ VERSE 1 ]
Growin up in Flint, I went to Gundry Elementary
A Little fat kid who ain't have shit, lived on Lorado Street
Don't get me wrong, cause we was far from po' though
But up-to-date tennis shoes was far from affordable
A runaway, well, that describes me best
Cause if things ain't go my way, it was time to jet
I ran back and forth from my mom's to my pop's house
And by the 9th grade I was a high school drop-out
15 and my life done went bad
By this time I was livin with my dad
Not thinkin 'bout what's goin on in life
And if I have to carry a gun or a knife
Will I have to use it, if so, then it's on
I never had a girlfriend to call my own
So what I'm seein now I'm really hopin it'll last
But if not - hah, I ain't too much worried 'bout the past

[ Night & Day ]
I ain't much too worried about the past
Ain't too much worried

Ain't too much worried

Ain't too much worried 'bout the past

[ VERSE 2 ]
Now my old man, yo, he doesn't say much
He works every day and fiddle-faddle with his truck
And when I went to school he was home in the bed
But when I came home, he was up gettin fed
Now people, don't trip, see, my pops never hang
But I can tell you this: that he is up on the game
Seven in the morning, I'm dressed in my Levis
Headed for school with my nigga, my nerve, T-Ray
Reached into the room and got my dollar off the dresser
Knowin when I get to school I get ganked for the rest of it
Huh, I saw an apple on the table, had to get me one
Threw on my Crew hat, the first kid in Flint with one
Me and T-Ray walkin up Dupont
All I'm thinkin about is skippin, that's what I'll probably do
But it really don't matter, nowadays it won't last
I ain't too much worried 'bout the past

[ Night & Day ]
I ain't much too worried about the past
Ain't too much worried
Worried about the past
Ain't too much worried 'bout the past

Ain't too much worried

[ VERSE 3 ]
So now I got a baby and a baby on the way
As long as me and both of the moms are cool, I'll never have to pay
It's not what I bargained for, but it's what I've bought
And if I have to pay child support, I'd be my fault
But I ain't the type to get uptight and fighting things
I'm tryin to be like Spike and 'do the right thing'
I'm never ridin dirty nor negotiatin kilos
Me and Pop Breed and Al Capone, we ride in trio
Coolin in the Cherokee, them girls hollerin "Eric Breed"
Puffin up on the dank, cause I ain't messin with no generic weed
I'm in the world, I'm tryin to make a livin, son
We need money, and ain't nobody givin none
My own boss, I'm workin at my j-o-b
No more kids and no more women playin me
And as long as I keep my mind on straight, I'm gon' last
I ain't too much worried 'bout the past

[ Night & Day ]
I ain't much too worried about the past
Ain't too much worried
Worried about the past
(Huh, nah...)
Ain't too much worried 'bout the past

Spice 1:
Some niggas be all up in my shit, you need to quit

Tore back ass out bringing you your hat
Flat broke, talking about fuck that nigga S-P-I
But you can't go one on one Spice 1 because I'm born
To die
I gets even up on they ass like punk bitches in ditches
The gangsterism resulting in murderism
Bailing up in your hooptie at the gas station
You facing the killer for real-a punk ass nigga
Where the scrilla
Jacking you for your shit, taking your ends pull off
My mask
Hitting the corner, hopping up in my Benz with your
Cash
Mobbing I mash out, you ass out
Left you shot up in your seven-trey glasshouse
Because you don't know me like you think you do, I'm
Down for thefetty
Ready to die for them presidents, high powered and
Deadly
I ask to ball or not to ball, partner answer the
Question
I meet a nigga running up on my hooptie with Smith
And Wesson

Chorus

Yukmouth:
One time for your mind
Here to represent the pimps, playas, hustlas, ballers
All my niggas on the grind, packing nine millimeters
Nine lives like cheetahs, but your still in ???
Drug dealers peep the shit that I kick
Hustling, busting down zips making chips
If we ain't making it we taking shit
To the extreme hit the scenery with machine
Gun, get the creamery and ice cream, nobody scream
Nobody run, I come like point blank
Mobbing the motherfucking bank, looking like Benjamin
Frank and Itake
So many penitentiary chances, to make
Scrilla scratch niggas must have more stack in the safe
I mean ???, nigga your safe is my safe
And I'm gonna make sure that my safe ain't your safe
By putting a .38 up in your face
For running up in my place and shake the spot
And not expect to get your ass shot
Yeah, another one bites the dust, the shyster busts
Caps at your house
Matter fact, niggas don't like the Yukmouth
About to L-U, didn't they tell you
I'm a youngster trying to have something like my
Nigga L-Q
Ballin'

Chorus

Spice 1:
It's the motherfucking East Bay G with the hundred
Clipper, savage thugnigga

Mob style haulering 187 up in your face
Put a gauge between your throat and tell you that
Your out of place
Motherfuckers don't be knowing we vicious and vicious
To get the cheese
More tickets to G's, cruises overseas
Can't be no punk about the shit that we're in
Got to be a soldier to the game or nigga you'll never
Get your dividends
Balling til I die, until I die I'll be a baller
Let my riders do the dirt and I'll be the shotcaller
Whatever I got to do for the lifestyle that'll pay
Them forever
Never slip stay on my toes nigga walk with the yellow
Stripe
But pull me back, because they cowards and shit
I be the nigga that take your drama and put a twist
In your the shit
Caps get slapped with steel, hot slugs will be your
Meal
Fucking around with my money is just going to get
Your ass killed

Interlude{Big Mike:}
It's been a 8 year spread and 4 baby mamas
Still ain't found no wife, all I found was drama
Past dwellin, was it that or was it just us?
Love, was it that or was it just lust?
Fucked once, made love about a thousand times
Bought a crib, and all you could say was that the bitch was mine
Selfish thoughts, knew you was lookin for a backdo'
Think I'm kickin bullshit? I'm kickin fact, ho
Fell for a pretty face, thick hips and bitty waist
Spent my time with you and all it gave me was a shitty taste
Played a game of chase from my town to yo hood
Runnin back and forward thinkin it was all good
I shoulda left you there, pretty face and sandy hair
Gave you the world and couldn't recognize a man that cared
Dick sucks with intentions just to get me sprung
Was it a game when you laid there swallowed my cum?
I was something dumb thinkin you were there for me
Played the game with both of my hands and never cared for me
But everybody plays the fool once or twice
All it did was make me stronger, bitch, ain't nothin nice

[Chorus]
	It's better that I find out now, rather than later
	It's better that I make a clean break with all my paper
	It's better that I find another chick to take your place
	It's best that you get your bitch-ass up out my face

{MC Breed:}
Met her when she was 19, brand-new
And she only went out in tight jeans, and could dance too
Burgers and fries, bout 30 lives, told to her
Game, sold to her, plus everybody knew her
What the business? Except I got kids for a witness
And you let her make a come-up like survival of the fittest
You a sucker for a pretty face, smile and a pussy
You a clown runnin round actin wild like a rookie
I know you know she got somebody else on the side
Came through with you while she was rollin in his ride
You know the rules, your bitch chose him, now keep your cool
A sucker for pleasure is just a full-grown fool
Now tell the truth, she's somethin you see walk around - woof
Had you done swooped and went and bought her ass a coupe
Just a nigga with a brown nose, the town knows
Still come around swear he clown those
It's better that you find out

[Chorus]

{Devin:}
I wish I woulda known you was a crazy bitch
Before goin over to your house and layin some dick
I thought it wasn't nothin but a mutual nut
We fuck, I get mine, you get yours, we get up
But before I can get to my crib you hit my hip
Still ready to fuck with the smell of dick on your lips
I started thinkin with my dickhead, man, that big red
Pushy-ass pussy, it's big and it's bushy
Couldn't help but to backdo' that ass again and again
Nut after nut, shit was cool, but then, you look, friends
Started dippin, trippin and callin my house
With my gal sittin by me lookin all in my mouth
I say: "Hey!", and cough, but she know I'm tryina play it off
"What's up, nigga? - Bitch, when I see ya I'ma kill ya!"
It's better that I find another freak to take your place
One who won't have me dealin with a domestic case

[Chorus][Too Short]
You know we ridin', yeah we ridin'
I got my nigga MC Breed in the house
Big Baller, what you ridin' boy, what you ridin'

[Hook]
I got some candy paints sittin' on these
Platinum peices and some ho's from over seas
A mansion, a yacht, and some G's
Everything about you, thousand motto nigga, yeah
Can't even tell you what I make a year
I got some candy paints sittin' on these
Platinum peices and some ho's from over seas
A mansion, a yaht, and some G's
Everything about you, thousand motto nigga, yeah
Can't even tell you what I make a year

[MC Breed] (Too Short)
(Spit it)
Max fold, the chef could be proffesional when rap is my colateral, for this cash flow
I got some candy paints sittin' on these
Platinum peices and some ho's from over seas
A mansion, a yaht, and some G's
To be respected for the past and the present
Uh, and show my ass at every session (yeah)
And sure enough, (what) I'm gettin' closer to my destin
(Nigga, Breed you ain't shit) No interuptions only testin'
(But I do) Uh, prove that I'm smooth with an aseditive
Bumpin' just a little bit better than my competitor
Hard you better than, you ain't gotta say it is
Everyday that's the way it is, keep it Manist
Back for some of that, Breed when the funk shit
All up in yo' ass and get cash yo' ass bump this
Bobb and weave MC's never could handle me
Thinkin' bout' changin' my name to Scandal-la, you follow
Now get the paper with my motto
Them niggas need to get in position and go on and hate me if you gotta
Gotta meal won't you have a plate, I'll have you wait
Go on and sit inside my Lincoln while I navigate

[Hook]

[Too Short]
Mackin' in my lac and when I stack em' in the back
I don't give them bitches slack, cause if she's in my Cadillac
She'll be giving up the crack tryna' get a niggas scratch
When she suck a million dicks the bitch'll get a platinum plack
I said BIATCH, that's what I said when I grabbed her pony tail and she was givin' me head
I said BIATCH, you know what's up I put my dick in my draws' and zipped my jeans up
And instantly; you finna' see how pimpishly, I get these ho's in the streets
You niggas killin' me; you ain't feelin' me the bitch got you burnin' smokin' penni-cillin-weed
Or dip yo' dick in some hennessy, you'll be a God damned fool if you listen to me
I tell you shit that you can't believe, I got the bad ass bitches and they stankin' free

[Hook]

[Too Short]
I told Breed these young niggas think we gettin' old
I seen em' gettin gas down on Cascade Road, still makin' money in these new days
Used to have sky pagers now we got two-ways
We dipped to my house and let the beat crank
So many placks on the wall you can't see the paint
But its loud, you know how wild your friends get
Ballin' so long been through three body styles and big Benz's
If I cut it, in the garage
I'll make the bitch think im the wizard of Oz
Click yo' heels three times you swear you seen magic
Now she's a star, she used to be a maget
Her pussy went platinum, thats what I heard
Like when I'm rappin, you never get enough of my word
I'm in my third decade of gettin paid to rap
Back in the day my tapes stained the deck

[Hook]

[Too Short]
This shit bumpin mine ain't it
Oh you gotta be riders if you wanna bum this Short dog shit
You can't be in no little bullshit ass car with no bullshit system
What you ridin' nigga, you got candy?
You got rims nigga?, yo' beat ain't bumpin' nigga
This shit bumpin', turn that shit up, BIATCH![ VERSE 1: Passion ]
I be the P-a-crooked letter-crooked letter
-i-o-n, and it don't get no' better
I be legit, like E-40 I'm sick wid it
East meets West, I make it 'southernplayalistic'
I be doin this without strugglin
You wanna be down like me like Brandy
I demand the phony MC to hand me
The mic, I spark it up, I do whatever
Wanna-be MC can get your style severed
By this terrorist lyricist, you will believe
Flinttown and Brooklyn, Passion and Mr. Breed
Number one big ballers, player-haters get deceased
Fuck peace and compromise, it's do-or-die in the East
You don't wanna see Def Squad, we dangerous like Too $hort
We burn mics like blunts and light the stage like Newports
See, lyrical-I believe in eye for an eye
And for them wack-ass niggas, see, I predict genocide
The unfuckwittable MC, my golden touch be king like Midas
The lyrical death certificate writer, my style's the tightest
Step up and play it hard, and get your whole style scarred
See, I be on Southern Avenue and Lindon Boulevard

[ Chorus ]
Cause I do this without strugglin
When I bless this
Many wish to be as crisp
Never mind
Cleverness
Bitch				(2x)

[ VERSE 2: Chuck Nyce ]
Young Chuck and I makin a come-up like throw up
No luck, I been fusin, waitin to blow the fuck up
Like napalm, back, legs and arms explode
Like pipe bombs, so ring the alarm, it's on from dust to dawn
Landmines and trip wire
Cover my entire front lawn and four rottweilers
Prowlin the premises, and hop the fence
And get that ass crucified like Jesus, believe it
I stays weeded and smokin MC's like seedless sativa
Battle to travel through valleys of lost
And dead MC's and never got defeated
MC's retreated once the battlefields got heated
My projectile heat-seeking missiles
Check it, I'm settin it off and representin these Flint niggas
Street gorillas, drug dealers, sushi dinners
Sippin quart, I'm blue with a twisted lemon
Weed, twisted swishers, we split it and fill it
We fill it, lick it, then seal it
Then lift it to your lip and ah - feel the effect

[ Chorus ]

[ VERSE 3: MC Breed ]
Now this is bein done for you non-believers
I'm bringin bats, bitch, machetes, gats and cleavers
Now which one of y'all wanna come see the B-r-double
I'm ridin, nigga, and you can run and ask T-Double
I run sport like Berry, but big balls like Jerry
And it's gon' take more than phone calls, nigga, to scare me
My infrared got a date with your head
And my beat'll getcha after I fill my clip with lead
Bloodshed ain't shit to me, most of this shit is meant to be
In an infested society, physically and mentally
Follow through with basic instinct, nothin superstitious
Many await your downfall, so clown all bitches
I got my riches from the streets
So when it comes to streets I get my eats, props to my peeps

[ Chorus ]

[ VERSE 4: Jamal ]
Look, I beez Mally G the villain
Kill your whole scene with the guillotine shotie
Aim it at your body
Look, I spit the lead till your bodyparts spread
Now Passion got it, the red's dotted, spotted on your head
Stand still, see the blood spill
I ain't bullshittin, muthafucka, on the reals
Run it, I got the gat, I'm about to gun it
Son, it don't matter, I'm leavin your crew clueless like 'Whodunnit?'
Fuck it, got me on some iller shit
Bestow upon you the power to move, so I can blast, kill you, bitch
Ask which ass MC's (fuck you trick-fleas)
Claimin you real, that shit came with your deal
I speak from the heart, freak tracks apart
With insane lyricism - off the ism
-atic auto-tactic the show flows
Illadelphiadic, who the fuck want the static?

[ Chorus ]
