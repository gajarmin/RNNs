[Verse 1:]
So you want to be a gangster.. all that shit
Smoke any motherfucker, don't even trip
You be hard as hell, take whatever you want
Punk suckers wanna front -- they get done
Cause you a gangster -- nuttin more nuttin less
Put my boy to the test and catch one in your chest
Since he was young, homeboy won't back down
Cause real gangsters, always hold that frown
Until you lose control, then you sell your soul
To the devil motherfucker cause you're way too cold
And all the people hide and just run inside
Cause you keep usin yo' gat commitin homicide
Boy I tell ya, Life Is way Too $hort
Another brother just got smoked
And you killed him -- ain't that a bitch?
Cause it really ain't shit

[Hook:]
(gangsta, gangsta)
Shoot em up (gangsters)
That ain't cool (gangsters)
Ain't that a bitch (gangsters)
Shoot em up (gangsters)
That ain't cool (gangsters)

[Verse 2:]
Let me tell you somethin youngster.. you got it all wrong
Gangsters don't live that long
I had gangster potnahs get they HEADS to' off
For some of that gangster shit, get caught in the cross
You want stripes, take yo' ass to the service
Cause when it's on, ain't no time to get nervous
Pull the trigger.. yeah you did it
You'se a gangster and I got to admit it
But you'se a youngbuck.. you ain't learned yet
Killing don't make you a vet
Get out the fast line -- stick with the homeboys
Ready made gangster get gone boy
Cause where I'm from it's the same old shit
You call them shots, when you're down with the click
Niggas dyin everyday but that's a black thang
You either sell dope, or your gangbang
But you got the biggest heart in the click man
You did a murder, and now you're a hitman
All your homies tryin to tell you, that ain't cool
Playin shoot 'em up, like a fuckin fool
But you'se a gangster, one they can't destroy
Don't even give a fuck, about your boys
You go for self, you wanna be on top?
Fucked around and now your brother's shot

[Hook:][Intro]
Mack playas, ballas, grindas
Yeah I'm the real true pimp of the year
Will ya feel me
Ha ha, pimp of the mutha' fuckin' year

[Verse 1]
Give it up give it up a give it to me
A big mack capitalized Double D, see
And it's on, so I'ma get sick with it
A give me drank and bomb and let me get with it
Yeeyah, cause I'm gonna be the biggest pimp of the year
Goin' around doin' shit like this here
Cause a nigga is strong
And way too long when it comes to my ding dong
But, bet, I get a check when I sign on the dotted line
So now I know I gotta get mine
It's really no thang to me
See, to be a real true P.I.M.P
Cause I had me a ho or two or mo'
Way back in 80 fuckin' 4
That's when I was a teen
But my dick was still big to make a bitch bleed, see
And of coarse I'm slappin' hoes
Smackin' hoes, up and down the fuckin' avenues
And ever I do that
I dig a deep in the pocket for the fat gat
Feel me. I'm so goddamn bad
That I had to kick off in a ho's ass
Cause the girl tried to do me
Ride of with her man in the mustang pony
And I know it'd catch up with her
Next day in the paper, yeah, the nigga raped her
But I'm not trippin'
Bitches like you wanna keep on slippin'
So I had to move on
To the next young bitch that had it goin' on
Ugh, and I'm not here to pump no fear
I'm just the mack playa' pimp of the year, bitch

[Hook]
Pimp, pimp on... You got all the ladies
Pimp, pimp on... You got all the ladies

[Verse 2]
First thang first on the second verse
I learned a hell of a lot
A get from the get down start
So I had my hoes hoin'
Had every tramp thinkin' I was the orthidano goin'
Cause all the game I spit is good shit
And the shit that I spit made me rich
Cause I was all about money
If the girl says she down, well bees come and get the honey
Cause I'm givin' it up quick
Take a hit, take a lick at them pink lips
Uh, and a bet is better than grey
Not knowin' that I bought this broad out of state
And I met her in Mentley
Lookin' just like the actress singer Whitney
But I knew she was a fake one
But to me young bra' it didn't really make me none
I just walked up to her
I said my name's Dru Down and I'll Slick Rick the ruler
And from the get go
I'm just a pimp, ho, ya comin' with me, a to the east side O
And then she said, "Okay
I'm on my way, let me pack my bags before today"
Yeeyah, then I said, "Get with it
And don't be a bitch and try to split"
Uh, She was right up under my wing
At the airport at 5:15
She said "Who are you and why are ya here?"
I said I'm Dru Down and pimp of the year

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I've got a thang for makin' hoes
Every woman that I touch bitch turns into gold
And I don't go for talk back
Have respect when ya speakin' to a pimp fuck that
Deduct from the paycheck
Matter of fact get yo ass in the back of the Cadillac
So I can ride and checkmate
Like rule number eight I keep a bitch in a plate
And no I don't play around, fuck around
A when it comes to my money, nigga
And when it comes to gettin' a bitch sprung
I give her Hennessy, a with the one on one
So she can get so high, real high
And that she that knows I'm that type a guy
Cause I'm a kick something just for the hoes
And for myself I keep indo'
And when a ho finds out I'm real, yes I am
Mack playa pimp of the year

[Hook x2][Hook 2X: 2Pac]
M.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks
And you know we keep it money over bitches

[2Pac]
Thugs known to bust on sight
God bless my crazy life la vida loca homie livin that thug life
Been raised in violence homicide's my lullaby
Came with the homies and learned to kick it until we die
Boss players you wonder why
I live the life of a ghetto kingpin, just let me ride
Bitches and niggas in penitentary suits
I send 'em letters and money orders and make 'em my troops
As for you females, I got no time, I gotta get mine
You cannot blind me addicted to a life of crime
My time as shorty was full of car chases
While runnin with John Gotti's and Scarface's
Niggas knew, I'd be the Don in my own crew
A million niggas with automatics who swarm through
You wonder who shot me here's a clue, stay alert
Cause we comin' for you, and keep it money over bitches

[Hook] w/ ad libs

[Fatal]
I blow you up on the spot, these Glocks hot 'til you drop
All you wannabe cops, you don't wanna see shots
I beef deep with the police peep what these streets do to me
Actin all new to me I creep on you like puberty
You don't wanna see the bad image of this scrimmage
From here to East Greenwich through every state with a sentence
Frozen weight in the cooter, ten plates to soup ya
1 2's we oughta cruise right by the state troopers
When I'm drinkin Cristal, start thinkin 'bout Al
Bacardi coverin my body at the wink and a smile
Bag a hottie or two, cause butter shotties for you
I got more bodies then Drew, I drink Mynotti on New, fuck your crew
This type of shit I do for a petty hobby
Fuck the world it's Fatal dog against everybody

[Hook]

[Mopreme]
My shit's phenomenal, droppin like domino
Comin with the real yo and fuck what you feel yo
This is not for all the freaks in short skirts
This is for my niggas nationwide doin work, get your feelings hurt
Lose mo' faith than a composure, money and the doja
Bitches is a cobra with deadly venom
Move as smooth as I get 'em, stackin G's
My niggas crosstown got ki's
Hoes get diseased and fleas, for these enemies money over bitches
(Nigga!)

[Hook]

[Big Syke]
I'm hittin sixteen switches, my money over bitches
The struggle continues I'll miss you on my road to riches
I'm contribed to strive never laggin
Disappear in the night with my 64 dragon, rag flaggin
As I get 'em up and leave 'em stuck
Pager blowin up but I don't give a fuck
I'm fully stocked on the block, pockets full of rocks sellin
Loc'ers and smokers engaged twenty-fo'/seven
So what can you do for me and what can I do for you
But stay true, and do the things that we do
Blinded evil-minded no option for my offspring
Reminded can't find it complications what the future brings
Losin my mind why you sweatin me all the time
I'm caught in a bind, quality time on my grind
Rather be lonely honey and dodge you like snitches
I'm 'bout my riches, money over bitches

[Hook]

[E.D.I.]
That's from the time a nigga close his eyes I'm hopin, I hope he awoken
Payin my own that's tokin chokin off-a Glocks smokin
Money and power watch these bitches cause they skanless
Gettin niggas fucked 'n stuck from Timbuk' to Los Angeles
Ain't a nigga ruggeder than this grimy Heine' guzzler
Cowards better duck before my calibers start rubbin ya
Me and my troops play blocks in groups, runnin in flocks
Deuce-deuce in my socks keepin a watch out for cops
Gettin kicked, I keep my mind on my riches
While uncontrolled schemes keep me choosin my money over all my bitches

[Hook] - 2X

[2Pac]
That's right nigga
Money over motherfuckin bitches
M.O.B. on 'em nigga
Keep your motherfuckin mind on your money, fuck these hoes
(Thug life baby) You don't need no motherfuckin bitches
You need some motherfuckin money
Get your mind right nigga, keep your game tight
Play right play by the rules and you'll get paid fuck the fools
We up out of this bitch here

[E.D.I.]
BIATCH![Spice 1]
Coolin' on the corner with the cellular phone
You could tell that the East Bay was his home
More mail than the rest of the pushers
Cause he got a TEC-9 in the bushes
And that's how his shit was handled
First name Jack, last name Daniels
Had two boys named E and J
E had the nine and J the AK
Clocked on a street called Hennessy
Rivals with a motherfucker named Ol' E
E had a bitch and her name was Gin
Had a nigga named Juice doin' time in the pen
You couldn't tell that Gin was a bitch though
Cause she was fuckin' some nigga named Cisco
E and J knew tonight they'd come
With two fat niggas named Bacardi and Rum
They capped Jack's ho and the sight was scary
The bitch was all bloody and her name was Mary
Officer Martini wiped up the body
And all fingers pointed at Rum and Bacardi
E and J told Jack the whole tale
So Jack tried to bail Juice out the jail
But Ol' E had the judge on a payroll clout
So Jack shot the judge up and broke Juice out
Now everybody's talkin' 'bout Gin and Juice
Juice shot Gin cause the bitch was loose
Now E is shook thinkin' they ain't gonna get me
I'll round up the posse and call up Mickey
Mickey was big, he only sold eight balls
Had 99 niggas up against the wall
E and J found out he made the call
So E and J and Jack and Juice nined them all
They were sent to the morgue and Mickey paid the bill
Got the money from the bitch workin' Strawberry Hill
Jack and Juice said Mickey wouldn't survive
But Mickey was slick he had a Colt 45
And now he's wonderin' how he got the word
It was the neighborhood wino Thunderbird
You wonder how the murder rap got so much juice
It was 187 proof
Check it out!

[Spice 1]
Mickey sent St. Ides after Thunderbird
Time for the hurricane, E said word
Thunderbird in an alley way wearin' a beanie
Tryin' to get a sip from the cop Mr. Martini
St. Ides screwed off Thunderbird's top
Spilled his drink and gave a swig to the cop
But it's too late Martini knows it all
Mickey and his boy Ol' E were slingin' eight balls
Of cocaine to the strawberries on the hill
So when he asked for Juice he got a quick fill
Mickey had his boy on Bourbon block
The murderous cop killer Mr. Peppermint Schnapps
Mickey had this thing about nosy cops
And it made Mr. Peppermint lose his top
Martini off duty waitin' for the night train
Didn't know his wife Champagne would ever see him again
Peppermint Schnapps creepin' with the Colt 45
Gotta peel his cap 'fore the train arrives
Gotta stay Lowenbrau here comes the train
"All aboard!" said the engineers Bartles and Jaymes
There was a toot from the train and then a gun blast
Martini fell on the ground there was a big splash
Mr. Schnapps got up because the cops chased him
St. Ides and Mickey in a 'vette ready in front of the station
But you know Jack and Juice was undercover
And Jack was mad because Mickey shot his lover
There was big shootout and Mickey got juiced
He couldn't hang with the 187 proof
Juice is splattered and St. Ides had took a fall
And then Endo smoked 'em all
Check it out![Intro]
Where them naked hoes at?
E-Feezey!
Too Scheezy!
We off the heezy fo'scheezy baby!
Off the heezy I thought you theezy!!
Niggas ain't havin no cheesy like us main!
They ain't havin no raveez!
Shit
Haha you know us
Where K-Ceeezi at man? Tell him sing that shit
Lace dem fools or something
Beotch!

[Hook: K-Ci]
Say that you got it all
Love the way you players ball
Everyday you're at the mall
Tell me is it true or false
Say that you got it all
Love the way you players ball
Claimin that your mail is tall
Tell me is it true or false

[Verse 1: E-40]
I put my mack hand down ain't never been asound
I was havin b-r-e-a-d way before this rap game nigga been town
Thought you theezy, for sheezy, niggas 'member
Earl, Brat, and Denell dem boys from Vallejo
At every light it's automatic, BURN RUBBER
See my folkers in the traffic, WHASSUPER
Follow that cab it got dope in it, uhh
My potnah $hort got hoes in it

[Verse 2: Too $hort]
I'm always hearin rappers big ballin on they songs
I do that shit for real and you'll never say I'm wrong
S-500 straight sittin on twenties
TV in the dash pimpin hoes gettin money
I'm Too $hort baby been down since the eighties
For the last eight years rode around in a Mercedes
Lexus, trucks, drop-Vette, Caddy
Bitches don't call me by my name they call me daddy

[Hook]

[Verse 3: E-40]
K-Ci $hort E-40 Fonzarelli
I'll probably never have long money like Ross Perilli
But shit we just want a hip
Don't want the whole plate
Don't put the two on the ten, don't ever perpetrate
Like a lot of these fools I see on TV
With the Armani Chanel Versus Versacci
Why motherfuckers can't be broke sometimes?
Sometimes it's cool to floss
But don't buy an eighty-five thousand dollar car
Before you buy a house

[Verse 4: Too $hort]
They always said I couldn't rap, I just say bitch
I guess the bitch, made me rich
And now you wanna call me hardcore
While I be steppin out the shower on a marble floor
I paid the IRS taxes send FedEx and faxes
This industry'll is like fuckin, fat bitches
All work and no play, I do it everyday
Anyway cuz I gotta stay paid 40

[Hook]

[Verse 5: E-40]
We throw parties on big-ass boats, niggas wrap they paper
Ultrafied all-inclusive trips, Montego Jamaica
Front row seats at the Ultimate Fights, shamrock and severin
Long expensive fuh-flights, up dere in the heavens
Fat ass royalty checks, fat ass cribs
Smokin blunts and drinkin brew on the blacony, barbecuin ribs
The more scrilla, the merrier
I represent the Ya area

[Verse 6: Too $hort]
I walk from Foothill and Havenscourt to Sixty-Seven MacArthur
To Freddie B house to make tapes with my potnah
Hit Arroyo Park, we had tapes for sale
Got a paper bag full of that, can't you tell
It's funky, everybody nod they head like this
I said bitch, and everybody read my lips
I got rich, suckin up the game from the O
And even though a lot of rappers got the same kind of flow
I survived cuz I got mo', game than them
It came straight from the prostitutes, players, and pimps
It was my destiny, I came the same every time
So don't question me, I transfer the game in the rhymes

[Verse 7: E-40]
I'm not a freestyler, don't rap for free main
It's Paystyle on mine, cuz I love money main
Landrovers and Toyota, Lexuses
Six-hundred feet twelve with them big ass motor Mercedeses
We don't be savin hoes, bitches be savin us
Bitch disrespect me in my car, bitch best to catch the bus
I keep a briefcase full of game, while y'all be ear-hustlin
Ain't no paperback pimpin nigga, we ain't strugglin

[Hook]

[Verse 7: Too $hort]
I'm Shorty the Pimp, I come funky
Again and again, they say when will it end?
Maybe never, cause I can still spit it
But I ain't rappin for cheese, I want meal tickets
Gotta start somewhere, and I'm past that
For the right scratch, I be the last mack
So stick yaself Pretty Tony
You tryin ta make a hit, but your shit sounds phony
Not like AT&T but like ET
You can't be me, so would you please see
If you can keep my name out your mouth
Cause you don't really know what the game's all about
It's bout feedin the family, not freakin in the Benz
Instead of rentin, pay for that roof on your head
And stop pimpin in your mind knowin you a trick
Put your hustle down playa go an hit you a lick
Bitch!

[Outro: E-40]
(That's writ, Too Scheezi, Ant Banks, Forty Fonzarelli, K-Ci)
Damn is that right?
(That's right)[E-40 having a playalistic converstaion]
Hoppin over barbed wire fences nigga
Had this one broad right, SHE was so damn sprung
She used to hold my motherfuckin.. motherfuckin sack, nigga!
Thought you thought, nigga
In a motherfucking VHS, uh.. motherfucking canister
Nigga, yeah ay, I promise you nigga this game been so damn good
(Said this rap game's been good to me)
Hard times
(But I don't know how long that's gonna be..)

[Hook: Otis & Shugg] (2x)
Hope I don't go back to slangin yayo
Slangin yayo, to get my maillll

[Verse 1]
Been a hustler since birth, mama sellin dinners for the church
Red-handed, caught me stealin money out her purse
Got branded, permanent whip scars on my back
Cause I used to get beat, with racing car tracks
But now me got wealth, holdin a conference call on my
Hands free car telephone lookin like I'm talkin to myself
Shootin the breeze cuttin it up real smooth like
Choppin it up like true business men
Talkin about it, by the way
B - what we doin' this week on SoundScan?
If I ain't in Japan, I'm in the Valley
Or maybe next door in Gary Payton bowling alley
Or maybe at the shootin range, me and Banks
Or on the golf course, with Merton Hanks
Or we lay in the sun, give me my propers
With a beat that's out of this world, lookin down on doctors
Sippin on Port, watchin my kids play basketball
In the backyard on a 40 by 63 foot long sports court
Biatch!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Business spot up in the wilderness, coyotes and wild boars
Dupont registry aluminum pool table made strictly for outdoors
Twenty inch gold super Bravos on my ? everybody ain't able
To be blessed with success with an independent-ass record label
Check it out, marbles, I got the game from my Uncle Saint Char-les
Used to bank across the street at Wells Fargo
But now it's Merrill Lynch
And just think, I used to sit the bench
I remember gettin chased by the cops, had to get my stomach pumped
Full of a quarter ounce of rocks, late afternoon
Po-po waitin for me outside of Vallejo Kaiser Permanente
Emergency room with Glocks, ready to Rodney King me to death
Somehow I managed to make my escape through
The back of the cafeteria by the vending machine department quickly
Found myself runnin through the Friendship Apartment Complex
Over there by the railroad tracks, around the corner from the
People's Continuation High School
Somewhere off in Lofas, behind Je-nai's Liquor ooh

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Get my mail, check it out, dope game ain't goin
Now it seems the, white-collared crimes, are hookin up phones
"Charlie Hustle, I got a few mathmatics
I'm doing a compilation, should I go with Phunky Phat Graph-X?
I tell them, "Hell yeah that's a done deal, dude them be off the hinges
Dude them did my cover and my bus benches"
Game warrior invested, worldwide Sick-Wid-It shit, independent chips
BEYOOOOOOOOOTCH!
Ay see ay, I'mma tell you nigga
That's the thing about this whole thing that
Jump off
It's a fool cause a muh'fucka take his bloody money right
Until
He sit up there and he look and he say
"Hold on man, hold on man"
Muh'fucka, yknowmsayin?
You can either be at this shit
Or you can be gone
With this shit
And you look at it and then he say, "Man hold on
Let me translate this shit - let me translate into some marbles
Let me liquidate my motherfuckin revenelles"
You understand what I'm sayin? 40-Water now, you understand?
Ay, ay, but look, check this out
I'm here to sprinkle motherfuckers, lace they tennis shoes
Teach them about the motherfuckin game-orienfested situations
That goes down in the motherfuckin motherfuckin soils weepolations

[Overlaps Hook]
I don't bullshit!
I ain't bullshittin nigga!

Don't wanna go back - back to the game, heyyyy

[Outro]
To get your mail, BEYOOOOOOOTCH!It's like root beer one of a kind
Spice 1 is up in the house with the niggata-niggata-nine
And the clip and the trigga
Mutha fuckas try ta play me yet they callin' me they nigga
Should I get the A.K. and jump like Jack
Or should I just reanimate the mutha fuckin' Fac
My name is Spice 1, but I be comin' like I'm 2
Or maybe 3 or 4 or just a mutha fuckin' crew
Late night see a drive-by drop Impala
The niggas took cover and the bitches all holla
If you think it's sick then nigga just throw up
I'm quick ta bust a cap and leave your fuckin' dome toe up
Cause livin' up in the bay is lke a mutha fuckin' zoo
Every nigga do whatever the fuck he gotta do
The mutha fuckin' rhyme did the crime last century
Now it's on parole because my mouth's in penitentiary
But back to the ghetto you see just about it all
Rest in peace to dead niggas on the wall
The shit it never stop because the nigga killed a cop
And now the cops are killin' the niggas 24 around clock
Around the block around the road in every ghetto
Mutha fuckas wanna drop me, so I'm livin' like the Devil
With the underground pound, muder facul-sound
So niggas that fuck around lay around
And before I end this rhyme
I'd like ta say peace to my mutha fuckin' nine

The Nine Milimeter, The Nine Milimeter

Shootin' dice with some niggas that I didn't know
He pulled a nine when the double 4 hit the floe
I wonder why he'd wanna play me like a punk bitch
I thought he knew I was the one to let the nine click
I played his ass like Jesse James and shot him in the throat
I picked his tongue up out my mail, now I'm outty ho
I'm stressin' it's a fucked up world "G"
I think about the shit that I used to see
Niggas runnin' 'round with the street sweepers
Mutha fuckas layin' dead loose change, beepers
Bitches screamin' about the niggas gettin' fucked up
Fuck his bitch too, she was stuck up
187 mutha fuckas that my showcase
I'll load the clip and kill a whole mutha fuckin' race
I'm stressed out like a mutha fucka
Bitch got me for a 20, damn clucka
Yeah your right I'm livin' wrong "G"
And I never gave a fuck about a dope fiend family
I seen a dope fiend killed last week
Left a bloody base pipe in the street
They burnt the bitch up in the trunk over 80 dollars
Started drivin' around the hood and I can hear her hollar
Smoke comin' from the trunk bitch burnin' up
Cops turnin' down the streets they was turnin' up
I'm hearin' shots ring out 12 o'clock at night
A car full of dead niggas in the midnight
Because it gave the cops a reason just ta shoot 'em up
But now they tape the shit off, so yo suit 'em up
And before I end this rhyme
I'd like ta say peace to my mutha fuckin' nine

The Nine Milimeter, The Nine Milimeter

The police was comin' I had ta dump the body
But like I said on the city streets I'm John Gotti
When it comes to the gangsta rap shit
I do a drive-by murder your whole click
See I'm a rebel without a pulse
Cause in my neighborhood you learn not to walk
Without a nine in your draws
It's like American Express
Because a lot of crazy niggas wanna spill your flesh
But some crazy jealous mutha fuckas never sleep
I'm gettin' C.B. banner on the beep, beep, beep
Fill a, nigga to the rim like brim
Do a drive-by while I'm suckin' on a Endo stem
Mix hennesey with thunderbird, Gin and juice
I'm high as fuck, fuckin' around with 187 proof
Hard as a nickel but I'm quick as fuck to drop a dime
Because my boys got a nigga back prime time
Rata-tata-tat-tat
Any bitch wanna squab it's like that
Cause I ain't goin' out like a fag
Got the nigga for a ounce and a Jag
Straight trip and pop the clip
Now I'm gettin' rich off his sip
Pick up my boys on the block and it's on
Slangin' dope by the drug-free zone
Straight gangsta mack
Keyes over keyes over g's I stack
So when you step, step with caution
Cause a nine to your throat 'll have ya caughin'
The S-P-I-C-E
In a rage with a gauge gettin' P-A-I-D
I ain't goin' out fuck Mickey D's
I'd rather pimp hoes and clock g's
Cause that's what a real nigga do to make a livin'
The talent of pimp was naturaly given'
So before I end this rhyme
I'd like to say, Peace to my Mutha Fuckin' Nine

Yeah
I wanna say peace to my other mutha fuckin' nine
Yeah Ant mutha fuckin' ba-ba-booga-booga mutha fuckin' Banks
I wanna say what up to my nigga G mutha fuckin' mzz-Nut, yeah
I wanna say what up to that girl Shorty B in the mutha fuckin' house
And my mutha fckin' D.J
Xtra mutha fuckin' Large go on with your big ass heh-heh
Yeah, my nigga M.C. mutha fuckin' Ant
Kickin' the funky shit with Spice mutha fuckin' 1
187 in the mutha fuckin' house, Peace[Spice 1]

Mickey sent St. Ides after Thunderbird
Time for the hurricane, E said word
Thunderbird in an alley way wearin' a beanie
Tryin' to get a sip from the cop Mr. Martini
St. Ides screwed off Thunderbird's top
Spilled his drink and gave a swig to the cop
But it's too late Martini knows it all
Mickey and his boy Ol' E were slingin' eight balls
Of cocaine to the strawberries on the hill
So when he asked for Juice he got a quick fill
Mickey had his boy on Bourbon block
The murderous cop killer Mr. Peppermint Schnapps
Mickey had this thing about nosy cops
And it made Mr. Peppermint lose his top
Martini off duty waitin' for the night train
Didn't know his wife Champagne would ever see him again
Peppermint Schnapps creepin' with the Colt 45
Gotta peel his cap 'fore the train arrives
Gotta stay Lowenbrau here comes the train
"All aboard!" said the engineers Bartles and Jaymes
There was a toot from the train and then a gun blast
Martini fell on the ground there was a big splash
Mr. Schnapps got up because the cops chased him
St. Ides and Mickey in a 'vette ready in front of the station
But you know Jack and Juice was undercover
And Jack was mad because Mickey shot his lover
There was big shootout and Mickey got juiced
He couldn't hang with the 187 proof
Juice is splattered and St. Ides had took a fall
And then Endo smoked 'em all
Check it out!For the funky beats I made I get for my grade
I'm from the Dangerous Crew, I can't hang with you
Cause I'm from Oakland, bitch, where the game is true
You don't belive me? Well, come on slide through
Because the city of dope will give you somethin' to ride to
Put my tape in your deck and do some damages
But the six by nines, they can't handle this
I'm twenty-three so I'm far from a young buck
This gin and juice is gettin' me pumped up
Fake rappers get chumped up
You wanna slang'em, watch your face gettin' lamped up
Well, what's my name? You can call me Banks for short
You wanna book me? You're about to see a gangsta show
Cause I be tighter than tight, give me a brew and the mic
And it will be on like chickenbone, you know that's right
Some mothafuckas didn't belive that I can do this shit
Kick some funky ass rhymes with some beats that hits
Now I'm provin' them wrong but still suckas wanna clown
But you jealous mothafuckas ain't bringin' me down
I kept faith in myself, that's what I had to do
To make it out here and stop fuckin' with you
I'm 2 the head...

Yeah! Now all you fake niggas: get the fuck off my nuts!

I got my shit rollin' so now I'm like a mack in town
And when I'm ridin' through, the hoes be flaggin' me down
I'm just a player kickin' funky shit with the Dangerous Clique
And all these bitches, they out to get some famous dick
But I ain't trippin', girl, you can bring that ass on
Cause all this jockin' shit ain't guaranteed to last long
But while it's happenin' you know I'm straight lovin' it
You put your pussy in position and I'm pluggin' it
But if you're lookin' for a nigga with a touch of affection
You better take your ass to the love connection
Cause, ho, I ain't got no trust in you
Cause if another rapper comes you'll be fuckin' him too
And that's real, save the love for ?????
Cause it's all about mackin' in 92
One love, I ain't goin' that far
I'm better known as a gigolo rap star
I like to fuck groupie bitches cause it's fun too
And I never get played cause I'm young true
Hoes wanna be mine but that's a no no
Get the fuck off my face, bitch, I'm 2 the head, ho

Now for verse three, you know it never quits
Cause Ant Banks is in the house makin' hits
And since I'm doin' this I gotta deal with jealous punks
Mad cause my shit like pumps in the trunks
And when I'm ridin' I gotta roll strapped in my 500 Benz
Cause it's sittin' kinda phat, fake niggas smile on my face
But they ain't bold ones
Trippin' out cause they ain't ridin' on gold ones
I know you're envies, that's hell of dumb for me
Cause the shit I got, it didn't come for free
Late nights at the studio bustin' my ass crack
Tryin' to make hits, man, but where was your ass at?
Probably at the corner drinkin' Old E, slangin' D
See, you was sleepin', now everybody's know me
I guess hard work pays and doin' nothin' is off
Lazy niggas like you were once fuckin' us off
Stop talkin' about me and get a J-O-B instead
Bitch ass nigga, I'm 2 the head...

Yeah and this goes out to all you shit talkin'
Bandwagon ridin' mothafuckas: get off...Too $hort:
If your a real hustler your sure to get rich

[Hook]
This is for the hustlaaaas, come on
This is for the hustlaaaas, ohh
This is for the hustlaaaas, come on
This is for the hustlaaaas, ohh
Ohh, come on, come on

[Verse 1: Too $hort]
I make money like a motherfucker
It ain't no thang to me
$hort Dog in the house spittin game with Breed
Ain't no bust partner, that's the third week
I'm going to pimp these hoes, they can't work me
How the hell you think I get to ride a B-12?
The phone and TV ended with a green smell
I went from Oakland to Atlanta with my top down
$hort Dog, my shit is nation wide now
You can ask Breed or Pac it don't stop
I ain't bull shittin make a mill when I rock
Three players in the game and it's a major
Bitch you wanna get me better hit me on my pager
Today I'm on the westcoast
Tommorrow I'm in Texas
Flip the Benz and Farri, sold the Lexus
$horty drop the bass in the mix
You know what's next bitch
I'm sure to get rich

[Hook]

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Haha
I'd be the thuggin ass outlaw
Til my fuckin casket drops
Fuck around and make me blast on these bastard cops
This is for the hustlaaaaas
Believe me coming stapped with the gat
When you see me
Label me a threat to society, but I ain't quitin
Thug life motherfucker ain't no bull shittin
Born in these projects destined to fate
Collecting mail on these broke bitches
Slanging that game
Now shit done changed
It ain't the the same
I ain't lyin niggas are dyin
Three strikes have you motherfuckers flyin
In the penatentary or in the cemetary
Gettin high no need to worry
Last year niggas knockin up the block and in between shots
Pumpin tapes from that nigga Breed and Pac
This year bringin you the fix
Including Ant Banks in the mix
We're sure to get rich
Still I ride

[Hook]

[Verse 3: MC Breed]

I'm a cold-hearted fool
I mean a fool at heart, head strong
And I won't be headed home if he falls apart
Conatact niggas like a part time
When I ride the beat
Ain't no way to hide from the darkside
Man of many mens till the very end
And blend in and change my iden
Just to mix up with the game
They know me by the Breed and they don't know it's my last name
It's mind over matter
I don't mind, you don't matter
Pull a Glock and watch the whole block scatter
And we can have us a gat to gat talk
Do it old style and do a back to back walk
Count to ten and say goodbye to your friends
And we can put the bull shit to an end
I figure if he plays around he lays around
And he's a motherfucker goner, call a corner when I'm around
Bodies are buried and found all around
And parish and charish and thoughts just to be true
Punk, fellas behave ya and it just might save ya
So guard your girl and pickup your pistol
Cause you can't get wit Breed the weed head lyrical nit wit
The shit won't change as long as I'm alive
I gotta survive and keep it tight

[Hook]Too $hort:

I used to have a lot of bitches
Straight down for me
Doin' anything I said, even ho on the street
But I'm a dog and I dog my broads
Guerrilla pimpin', drivin' four door cars
Ain't got no kids but them bitches love daddy
They had to share me or them bitches couldn't have me
Cause I'm a Mack with a capital M
Call me $hort Dog baby, put the P in the Pimp
I keep my foot in your ass and wouldn't give a fuck
Get out her pocket, bitch you gettin' beat up
You see me hangin' with them niggas like jock
And every single five mile, bitches gettin' popped
Well now I got a rep and they say I'm wrong
I beat my broad ass and she moved back home
Came in one night, I was buzzin'
Bitch tried to front me for fuckin' her cousin
She started yellin', man, the bitch got raw
I took one step back and went straight to her jaw
I gives a fuck that the bitch left
Cause all she ever got was some good dick
And it really ain't shit to find another bitch
Cause I'm a cool motherfucker and I'm hella rich
(Yeah) Ant Banks in the house and you know he knows
Grab the mic nigga, fuck these hoes

Ant Banks:

Yeah, I'm thinkin' back 'fore a nigga just came up
Playin' games with the bitches
Thought a nigga might change but
I was tight thinkin' everything's all right
Doin' the same shit to a different bitch every night
Just dickin'em down like a gigolo
So you gotta peep game from a nigga though
I'm too young to get sprung so don't trip, tell'em
(Ain't no love, bitch)
So let's speak about a freak named Connie
Fucked the bitch tough, backstage at the Omni
I can't forget Constance, the bitch is so dumb
Quick to lick my nuts, suck my dick, and just hum
And these are just some hoes
That a nigga like tossed up, kinda crossed up
Turned out and lost but I ain't trippin'
They all got tramped
Used and abused till they all just vamped
And left a nigga stuck with no kind of get back
Now I even get shook by the hoodrats
Cause they know what the fuck they gon' get
Took for they cash and a mouth full of dick, huh
And I hate I gotta be that way
Goin' vicious on these bitches
Just made'em all leave today
But I know it won't last long
They sayin' fuck Ant Banks
Now all my bitches is gone

Too $hort:

All my bitches are gone, them bitches bounced
I had a gang of'em, now they can't be found
They ain't fuckin' with $hort Dog
Cause I'm from Oakland
You fuck with us bitch, somethin' gettin' broken
Your leg, arm, jaw, nose, pick a part
Oakland motherfuckers'll break your heart
Until you recognize game in your face
You's a punk ass bitch, ain't never been no place
I can't hold back, now's the time
To leave your stank fake broke ass bitches behind
And move on like a player
I'm knockin' ghetto hoes and even squares
Secretaries, nurses, and police women
I'm flyin' first class, nigga, fuckin' flight attendents
$hort Dog ain't nothin' but a dog, beeyatch
(Ain't nothin' new nigga, come again)
All my bitches are gone, them bitches cut
But I really don't give a fuck
I always knew I didn't need that ho
I got the game from the motherfuckin' E-S-O
And you can tell when I hit the place
All them star-struck bitches jump in my face
And get shot to the curb like I'm the mob
Unless they givin' niggas blowjobs

Ant Banks:

Yeah, and when a bitch wanna flirt
I put in work, treat'em all like dirt
And watch them get they feelin's hurt
Cause I'm a mack, ho, listen to this rap, ho
And you will know not to fuck around
You'll get slapped, ho
For tryin' to fuck up the Ant Banks program
Steady saltin' with your stanky ass toe jams
You're mad cause I wouldn't spend no time
I'm with the homies, makin' cash
Pullin' bitches and writin' rhymes
I'm just doin' what I got to do
I'm not fuckin' with you
Because your funky ass cock is through
So now I gotta get some new hoes
Some old school bitches
That's still ridin' trues and vogues
I want a freak with the gangsta look
That Ant Banks can hook
And the bitch better know how to cook
Cause I'm a nigga that'll eat some shit up
Macaroni, steak, collard greens, or whatever the fuck
Yeah $hort, you know how we do'em
Treat bitches like red lights and run right through'em
I got my mack on strong and my dick on long
So fuck it, all my bitches can stay gone

Too $hort:
Mine too
Ant Banks:
You know what I'm sayin'?
Too $hort:
Yeah, beeyatch
Ant Banks:
$hort Dog in the motherfuckin' house
Too $hort:
Nah nigga, you in this motherfucker
Ant Banks:
Bringin' this shit for nine-tre and nine-four
You know what I'm sayin'?
Get in where you fit in, hoes
Too $hort:
Before you need a check up from the neck up
Ant Banks:
Peace out
Fuck these bitches, man
Fuck these bitches, $hort
Let's get out of here, manI'm all rapped up in this ghetto shit
So when them task tried to blast I just smashed on the pedal quick
Heading for the hideout
The night wasn't finished so I..
Hooked up with Ron.. smoke some bomb so we could handle some business
Bad N-Fluenz minds click
Listen to some Spice 1 so I'm thinking about some nine spit
And you know that Smoke Season's in
But I'm an Alkaholik, I'll be back Ron
I'm bout to go get some Seagram's gin
Riding to the mother fucking liquor store..
Got the mini-tech as I pick the show.. just so the tricks will know
Pulled in front of the store, this nigga mugging like he know me
I look at him, walk in the store, got my gin and Ron an O.E. 40
When I came out.. this nigga straight Dru Down on me..
Now I'm a cocaine tech.. what you going to do now homie
I knew he was going to try and do me soon
But I'm a mack like Goldy and a mother fucking looney toon
So you bout to have a slug in ya
I ain't loving ya..
I tack that ass like the Governor
Didn't see your partnas in the cuts smoking newports
They started busting their mouth it was long and their was Too Short
They must of thought I sold Heavy D
I make the caddy look like a steel bowl of spaghetti G..
Look how these punk ass niggas want to act tonight
It ain't my fault they didn't know I ain't rapped to tight..

I'm all rapped up I just can't quit
I'm all rapped up in this gangsta shit
I'm all rapped up I just can't quit
I'm all rapped up in this gangsta shit

Verse two:

Drunk again in the 40 some a sac or two..
Now I need 2 pac.. I mean go get two packs of brew
So I can go see this bitch..
I got the mini-tech but I got a license too
You know I got to B Legit
The Po Pos still pulled me over so and they swore me
They had a snoopin' ass dogg
Plus I had a warrant G
I ain't got no time for no drama though
So I bust a tec out the window and watch them fall like a Domino
Roll off like a cool G..
Wrap the tec up
Roll up.. a Cool J..
Roll up.. Smoke a lot of dubee
Striking in my long, tan caddy
A mother fucking super assassin like gran daddy
Still headed for the bitch house.. my partna told me
She was a dangerous dame.. but I had to check what you got
Cause I heard she like tough sex..
Like MC Lyte this ho wanted a ruff neck
And I got to get some cock today
And if I fuck without a rubber I'm going to have to go see Doctor Dre
And I don't want to get no D-Shot
In my ass.. shit I rather pass fucking with that weak cock..
I'm finally here so I can see whats up..
I got a soul full of midgets so you know of shit ya fuck
When I walked in I tried to show some gratitude
But she was a bitch with a problem and a ho with an attitude
I asked the bitch can I get some Ice Tea with Ice Cubes?
She smacked me mc pooh I ain't no nice dude
And she might get smacked tonight
Cause Ant Diddley Mother Fucking Dog ain't rapped to tight

I'm all rapped up I just can't quit
I'm all rapped up in this gangsta shit
I'm all rapped up I just can't quit
I'm all rapped up in this gangsta shit

Verse 3:

I tried to slap this bitch face off
Cause she was in the rage and she straight thought she was the fucking
Boss
And then the bitch called me out my name..
So I went to another level and put her in the House of Pain
She didn't know about this hard place
She tried to Kriss Kross me out so I left her with a Scarface
She thought that Ant Bank came phat
She thought that I was gonna save her and let her help me count my stack
She thought that I was richer then Richie Rich
But I ain't falling for no easy stick, finger ass trippy bitch
I straight left the bitch in Shock G smobbed off
Thought I was a Gangstarr
Couldn't nobody stop me..
I felt like a damn OutKast..
So I went to the Church and asked Father Dom to help me out fast
He said he couldn't cause I was Naughty by Nature..
A Public Enemy and everybody just hate cha
So fuck it..I'm out bumpin Mc Eiht
High as fuck and I'm stuck and I can't see straight
I handle business though..
Yeah it was a sinch job
I'm out to the cut to hook up with the Lench Mob..
And I'm about to burn ten more sacs tonight
And I don't give a fuck if I ain't rapped to tight

I'm all rapped up I just can't quit
I'm all rapped up in this gangsta shit
I'm all rapped up I just can't quit
I'm all rapped up in this gangsta shit*(Too $hort talking)

Eh yo Baby D, get yo lil ass over here on tha mic man, an show these

So what up

An if you dont know what to do, when I come through
Let this young mack show you
Grab the mic, an tighten up yo lyrics
If it ain't real, I ain't really tryin to hear it
See another MC's gettin mad as hell
Ain't nuthin mo funky than to be himself
I gotta make a knot
While I shake the spot
Cuz I can't be stopped

*(Too $hort talking)*

Lil mutha fucka spittin that shit y'all, that's how we do it in East

Generation step up baby

Verse 2 *(Baby D)*

So get on

BIATCH!!We havin big thangs
Ice Cube, the only nigga that can bring Too $hort out of retirement
Representin money
Hmm, beeitch

Verse One: Ice Cube, Too $hort

Wise crackin felines, unh
Can a nigga make a bee-line?
To that nappy area, don't wanna marry ya
Just wanna bury ya head in a pillow
Sorry but I got a kilo pussy-willow
Janked ass penicillin, ain't got ta ask how ya feelin
I'm tha nigga that got ya squealin
Ya wanna know how we keep these hoes in check?
Keep them broke and keep their panties soakin wet

I like to smoke big, ride fat, and always stack cash
Believe me, keep her breezy with her fat ass (fat ass)
Big thangs on my mind ain't trippin at all
They call me $hort, but I got a big dick in my drawers
I feel like a giant sometimes, bitch don't stare
You'll go blind from my diamonds
Tryin ta size me up, but basketball I ain't playin
Call a tech, blow the whistle, throw the bitch out the game

Chorus:

We havin big thangs (like it's the thang to do)
Big thangs baby ($hort Dawg and Cube)
We havin big thangs (like it's the thang to do)
Big thangs baby (you know it's true, really doe)

Verse Two: Ice Cube, Too $hort

Now how can I let this bitch run it?
When her ass ain't never felt the seats of a 600 (now)
Tricks we take shits at the rents, we don't get excited
Over long hair and big tits
$hort Dawg they get hella weak, when I tell the freak
We the richest niggas that you gonna ever meet
We got bosses in the back, countin the stack
We got cunts in the front with Hennesey and blunts
Now what you want?

She wanna get fucked all night long, bitch what's up?
You know I got a tight song
Heard me on the radio, I can't go wrong
But you ain't got no features, this can't go on
You're like a bundle of joy, but you're unemployed
You ain't throwin, so the pussy is just null and void
Do you really understand what I'm tellin you
Looks can be decieving, and bitch I ain't even feelin you

Chorus: add additional line

Best believe me, it ain't easy, to be off the heazee
(repeat 2X)

Verse Three: Ice Cube, Too $hort

You can try and figure out the new shit we on
Before you break yourself, make yourself at home
Give thanks, when it's Ice Cube, $hort Dawg, and Ant Banks
We all platinum, now ya got ta add francs
To the salary, that'll be cash or charge
So large, got a whole floor actin mirage
We like big thangs, we like runnin big trains
Of big beautiful bitches with big brains

Bitches with big brains, I went to Spelman College
To see if my dick could get some higher knowledge
But pussy is pussy from Bel-Air to the projects
Bitch better suck my dick
Ain't nothin new, the game is old
You think the bitch is decent, and that's the same old ho
Used to fuck the whole crew, we was ballin man
Westside!!! You know we doin big thangs

Chorus: same as Verse Two

Outro: Ice Cube, $hort Dawg

We off that heazy bitch
Beeeyyyitch
Hey $hort, give em yo part

Then I graduated to straight hard liquor
So hah, let me take a swig of that Crown Royal

Disease-infested back-polluted pussy hoochie mamas, ooh ooh
Give a damn, make that 2-8-9, think I had a V8
Highly carbureator, four-barrel engine scram
Get gas, go in sideways, figured up like a philly
Ready, get that motherfucker hop up away
Everybody got the munchies and they ain't tryin ta miss
We ride around the corner, nigga there go Emmitt Smith
Webulation! Bust a U-ey folker, oh as I'm hoppin out
Damn that's my beeper, I got dinner at the house
The rules and regulations of the game up in the Yay
Just slap a bitch silly if she gets off in my way
She's open to all the brothers, forgive me grandma yay
Three or four different bitches, five or six different times a day

I don't need no doctor, I don't need no shrink
All I need is broccoli and a 40-oh to drink
Smokin that broccoli now, takes me out
Smokin that broccoli now, takes me out

You see I can't stop I won't stop
'til I check a mil I need a super bad bitch
And a house on the hill
365 7days I believe crack pays
My estates been guarded by pit bulls and AK's
I'm straight cookin' them thangs
Movin' weight like I should
Cause a nigga livin' good

So each year I get better
To stay ghetto and clever
But be richer than ever

Why you move up out the ghetto (the ghetto)
Mothafucka I am the ghetto

Nigga I was grindin' tryin to take off niggas heads
Flossin' & fuckin' hoes when you was in kindergarten
Nigga this ain't Lenny and Squiggy
This E-Feezee & Mack Teezee
Fuckin' with Italian Romaine pasta chicken Tortellini
Thirty odd six custodian, with the scope
Far from Nickelodeon no shit no joke
Southern Cali up North see we be rollin'
Make a bitch purchase a gun
Report it stolen
Plead the 5th but don't snitch
No case cause they're po po
And they mami know that 12 gage equipment can be traced
Stand on ya bunions
Nigga don't try to get caught in his drawers
Cause them 2.2.3's be penetratin' through walls
Plus I got warrants and shit
Didn't pay child support
Thinkin' about skippin' town
Movin' to Shreveport
Bitch

Chorus
(Mack 10) You see I can't stop I won't stop
'til I check a mil'
I need a super bad bitch and a house on the hill
(E-40) From L.A. to the Yay see we be rollin'
Make a bitch purchase a gun report it stolen
(Mack 10)You see I can't stop I won't stop
'til I check a mil'
I need a super bad bitch and a house on the hill
(E-40) See you my dude right
That mean we pa'tnas in crime
It's Forty Fonzarelli and Mack Dime (Mack Dime) Bitch

Verse 2
(Mack 10) Forty I'm the one bro that's in the mix like gumbo
Now how can I stay humble
And make feddy by the bundle
Marv said we got bigger triggas
Mack we got bigger figures
Now throw the top back on the 'Rarri
And bang gears on these niggas
And watch what the money show you
About niggas that don't know you
Busters is gone hate
Real G's is happy foe ya
It's Mack Dime on the grind
Fool it's my time to shine
Now would you niggas kick back
And let me get mine
(E-40) Causin' havoc sparkin' up chaos
Bringin' the ruckus heavy metal heaters
Mobb, under buckets
If ya can't beat us
Then join us get on the team
Streetsweepers grenades rifles
And M1 car beams
Dice games craps bets over car titles
Pink slips cash money
Watchin' out for rival gang members beefin'
Bad weather but it all boils down to
Who got the most paper

Chorus

Verse 3
(Mack 10) I shoot 'em up like syringes
I know what real ends is
Lo lo's Harley Davis and big body Benzes
Ain't been faded so far on my wrist
I got a R hundred thousand dollar car
Cause I push the caviar
So what's up what you need everybody huddle up
Got that 2 for 1 special with the rock called double up
So get lit take a hit shop is open all day
From L.A. to the Bay it's Mack 10 & E-Fortaay
(E-40) Sometimes I wonder if it's worth this
Fuckin' with the law tryna make it look like
I'm runnin' a legitimate tow truck service
With a Just Say No to Drug bumper sticker
On the back window (back window)
Knowin' I been smokin' a gang of Indo
Around the corner four houses down across the way way
Make a right and then a left
Over there by Safeway and when ya get there page me
Punch in how much you wanna spend
Seperate the 20's from the 1's 5's and 10's
Slick sly sharp narcotic vendors
Always do business in shopping centers
Buck 'em stick 'em stuck 'em don't ever fuck me
Hate 'em bleed 'em love 'em shit can get ugly

Chorus

Hoo bang hoo ride (2X)
Hoo ride hoo bang
Who be ridin' who be bangin' (Westside) Ride Nigga
(Repeat)
Fuck 'em and feed 'em cold sardines, cold sardines
(Repeat)[Ant Banks]
Now come and take the realness
Fuckin' these funky hoes will make you feel this
Drippin' sensation stickin' your ace in the wrong place
And you'll be ass out dickless, passin' out when you get this
AIDS shit in your grave, ditch will be dug with a quickness
So this is the phase of the days when I grew up
Reminiscin' and trippin' off all them hoes I done fucked
But it's all good and plenty, I just can't count how many trampy hoes I done did it to
Licked it, did it, split it too
But shit is cool makin' the thrilla of Manilla
Scoop up the scrilla boy that cuchi be a killa
You can feel a order up with a nut and then bounce
And have that ass comin' up shorter than a fuckin' quarter ounce

[Gangsta P]
Let's get toe down off some X-O, puffin' on the cripto
Bent corner eyers up on her, super bad low down dirty shame
No need to know your age, bitch, what's your name?
Said her name was Tammy, lived with her granny
All I'm thinkin' about is gettin' in her panties
Got the digits, called her later on that night
At a two dome sex, flossin' big elex
Cocked the roof back, bitch, blaze the sack
Reached the destination, no hesitation
Out of my clothes in the guts about to nut
No protection, after two hours hopped out the shower
Dressed in Eddie Bauer, livin' like a true playas should
Six years later: test positive cause the ho was no good

[Hook]
If you wanna get your groove on, come and do a little somethin' with me
If you wanna get your groove on, let's wrap it up before we fuck
If you wanna get your groove on, come and do a little somethin' with me
If you wanna get your groove on, let's wrap it up before we fuck

[Celly Cel]
A-I-D crooked letter
Mothafuckas better strap up when they come together
It's a top notch so you ain't thinkin'
Got your battlefields sinkin', caught late night full of weed, drinkin'
Got ya creepin' in the unknown
Steered you wrong even if you get your head blown, fool, you still gone
Switch up your tactics: fuck with prophylaxis
It ain't about that raw dickin' her and nuttin' on the mattress
You didn't know these hoes will put the tags on your toes
Don't knows crossin' up the game because she chose
Listen to your homie Celly, nigga, before you hit the telly, nigga
Have a box of rubbers ready, nigga

[Almon D of 187-Fac]
I can't lie, this whole AIDS situation got my brain drownin' in illusions
Settin' niggas up for the conclusions
I ain't sayin' that I'm gonna live forever
Gotsta fuck new, get sometime in the future
Don't got no babies, what about the day when you get married
I hope I'm layin' in bed with a virgin with a meal that's urgent
She heard that I was livin' my lifestyle lavishly
Flashbacks of fuckin' her cousin in the alley
Smokin' on the twamp sack that she bought the jimmy hats
Three O'clock in the morning, sideways I was cuttin' the Pontiac strapped

[Hook]

[Den-Fenn of 187-Fac]
Well, here's a serious situation that we facin'
It starts off by doin' the nasty without no patience
Forgettin' about the condom, usin' and abusin' the drugs and methinfedamies
She wanted to suck my dick head so bad she was beggin' me
So I stepped to this straight bitch named Sally, Sally
Threw my slugs at a scallywag at a club in the valley
Leather trench, all hair down to her shoulders and back
Some Guess jeans all deep down and her pussy read fat
To be exact one of my niggas pulled my coat tail
And told me that the bitch was hectic: A-I to the D-S infected

[G-Nut of 187-Fac]
Mothafuckas be runnin' up in this bitch without no prophylactics
Filthy tactics, may as well pull the strap to your head and blast it
Suicidal decisions, livin' your life on the edge slippin'
With one foot off in the grave and the other one on a banana peelin'
But I ain't trippin', red ribbons on my chest
No chemotherapy treatments needed cause I'm a make it stretch
To my climax, strapped all over my dick
And when I digs I blow they mind back and then I grab my shit

[Hook]

[Spice 1]
Some of you niggas can't even say condoms
Some niggas be talkin' about conderves or condos, straight raw dickin' hoes
You don't know that ho, man, that bitch can't be trusted
Better be strapped with about four condoms if you plan on keeping your life
You're gonna be feelin' kinda fucked up and faulty
When you rappin' up on that stage and your dick fall off into the audience
Silent but deadly way of murder, it's mighty sick
Gotta have a bullet proof vest for your dick
Seventeen with the fat hydraulics
See, us west coast niggas is the most psychotic
Hittin' switches in my old school with four, fuck three pumps
My homie said that bitch had more pizzazz than "P" funk
I'm peepin' in the bitch out at the ho spot
Tryin' to throw that virus to my homie
Betta watch these bitches cause they're fake and phony

[Hook]Yeah
Spice muthafuckin One
Coolin in Cali
Kickin that gangsta shit
You get with it?

[ VERSE 1 ]
Hopped in my Blazer, mashed off and left a boy in his car, then
Tagged him with the skull and bones, cause he be soften
Hollow like a head without no brains inside
And his girl was so damn small, you had to strain your eyes
Got to the corner, hit a left, seen the HPD
That's when I knew that they were after S-p-i-c-e
Turned up my music and dashed, goin 90, I mashed
Bullet holes all in my window from a 12-gauge blast
He was all on my ass, I had to think real fast
Hooked a left, all of a sudden heard a boom and a crash
Tried to catch the cold, sold the devil his soul
Had his car and his face wrapped around a pole
With my vogues still smokin hit 580 to Oakland
Still upset with the police because my window was broken
But my beat was still bumpin and my amp was still pumpin
And my nine was in my lap if any funk was jumpin
Got the 20th and Nice as I kicked my tune
Hooked a left on 23rd and seen my homeboy June
Jumped straight out like an arrow, had more gold than the pharaoh
Had my Nikey sweat suit on and it was read like a sparrow
I told him what had happened and he already knew
He said, "You got a little funky with a fake-ass crew
The bass went boom and your gun went bang
And all you could see was flames"
At that very moment Coke and Ray started laughin
And slapped each other's hands and said, "It's all about blastin"
In the city streets

City streets

[ VERSE 2 ]
Kickin it at the park shootin craps with some homies
My first roll was a 7, so niggas can't get on me
So since my point is 4, I left a Little Joe
I'm kissin on the dice and I'm pimpin em like my ho
So then I roll again, I'm fuckin with Big Ben
Now I ain't fade jack because I'm mackin' with that ten
I picked up the dice, shook em up and rolled once mo'
What came out the do'? Whaddaya know, I hit that 4
Fuckin with the dank I'm hearin Marvin Gaye's oldies
Fadin another 20, took a sip of my 40
There go my homie G-Nut with the gin and the juice
My nigga's always fuckin with that 187 proof
I took a big-ass gulp and feelin quite tipsy
Knowin I'm like this these niggas try to cheat me
Huh, they can't get with me, I put em in his place
Then G-Nut threw the gin and busted a nigga in his face
I thought it was quite funny, and I began to smirk
The fat-ass niggas face was grounded lyin in the dirt
So I picked up my mail, and I'm about to go
Cause I'm about that mo' money, mo' money, mo'
Now homie on his face, he rolled over just like that
And said, "This is a jack, gimme all my fuckin money back"
I act like I was scared, gave his money back fast
And when he tried to leave, I busted a cap up in his ass
These niggas out the kitchen if you can't take the heat
Cause muthafuckas gank ya, shank ya, sank ya in the city streets

The city streets

[ VERSE 3 ]
A few weeks back I robbed a nigga for a ki
Kickin it on the block, slingin d to o-p-e
Yo, runnin from the five-o, you think this shit is funny
By any means necessary I must make my money
If niggas try to fade me, I pull out my nine
And pop-pop-pop-pop a nigga from behind
In this world of madness muthafuckas die
Niggas sling and bang, and bitches always lie
So I choose to be murderous and chop up niggas' bodies
And set like an example, a villain like John Gotti
The muthafuckin gangsta S-p-i-c-e
They ring my mobile phone, now who the fuck could that be?
Bitch, I said don't call me, I'm busy clockin g's
I thought it was the fuzz, but some niggas told me 'freeze!'
The barrel was my back, it's a muthafuckin jack
I knew I shoulda packed, I ain't goin out like that
These niggas caught me slippin, and fuck a yellow sack
Niggas must be trippin cause they Daytons touch my back
I hopped out of my shit and told him go ahead
And when he tried to leave I busted a cap up in his head
With blood all over his face is how the homie fled
I dragged him out the car and filled his corpse full of lead
These niggas out the kitchen if you can't take the heat
Cause bitch, I'm a gangsta, shank ya, sank ya in the city streets

Aight, Banks
Let's pack the shit up, mayn(Verse 1):
Now don't you run away from my Glock
You can't dodge 17 muthafuckin' shots
Could somebody pass me a clip and a trigger
Walk across the party pistol whip a nigga
Shiiit
I'm comin' up at 'em with the .9's the Glocks and Macs
And they'll never breathe again like Toni Braxton
Cause I don't see nothing wrooong with a little brotha jack
So say "what up?" to the 187 FAC
Nappy head ass muthafuckas wearin' plats
Kickin' back like a muthafucka slangin' sex
Ready to peel a nigga cap if they got the nap
So if you're funkin' with the FAC
Better to stay strapped
Cause we'll be comin' up at your back with the black Gat
Nigga, and you be feelin' kinda fucked up
When your homie dropped, it's simple
You can't run away from my Glock

(Chorus): 2x
Doncha runaway
From my Nine
There's no place to hide
I'm gonna get you by and by

(Verse 2):
Spiggedy One kickin' dat ass with some lay back shit
The trigga-happy nigga, I figure
Niggas won't wanna step to me
If they know I'll be bustin' caps
I roll straps niggas take naps
Cause I don't be fuckin' around
When it comes to bustin' that steel
I'm too real, niggas feeel me
When I kick this gangsta ass shit that you never heard
But fuck what you've heard
I smokes niggas like Herb
Put your ass smooth on ice
So nigga don't be 2 proud to beg
For your muthafuckin' life
Cause Nine Kelly I'mma make 'em stutter
Make 'em drop, nigga
You can't run away from my Glock

(Chorus): 2x

(Verse 3):
Comin' like the Lench Mobb swingin' on the vine
Bailin' out peace to my muthafuckin' Nine
Pullin' my cap back ready to serve they ass
Givin' a fuck about what the next nigga done up in the past
Nigga, I like to let a nigga have a bloody body
Don't think I'm bad, no box and no karate
Just a big fat Gat for them suckas
I ain't scared to you muthafuckas
Shiiit, and nigga that's how it be
"rollin' with my muthafuckin' strap on the side of me"
So don't come at me with that shit
'Bout you gon gaffle me up
I cock your cranium like the muthafuckin' [?], nigga
So keep your hand on your pistol grip
Bullets whistlin' and shit
Feel like a fuckin' missle when they hit
And I advice you to stay on the lurk
Cause if you funkin' with my niggas
You gon put in some work, nigga

(Chorus): 2x

(Outro):
Yeah nigga
You knew you couldn't fuck wid this G
Would you wanna step to me
Fault, ho, haha
Spiggedy One whippin' on that ass
Ant Banks in the muthafuckin' house
My nigga Omar
My nigga knocced out muthafucka drunk and shit
This nigga Jamar lay down the muthafuckin' studio
Drunk in tha muthafucka
You know what I'm sayin'
But you know one thing
Everybody in this muthafucka's strapped
You know what I'm sayin'
And nobody comin' up short
So don't try to run away from my Glock
Can't dodge 17 muthafuckin' shots

At the pace I'm goin now, it'll be too late
Can y'all taste it? go on and smell it
You know what that is? Well it's sucker repellant
I spray myself with it every morning, you dig?
I spray myself right before I leave the crib
Hot ones echo through the ghetto, bullets ricochet
I'm bendin corners in my Cadillac Escalade
It's summertime and I'm scorchin, fuck a bulletproof
I'm hella keyed and I'm perkin off that num-num juice
I'm in the traffic with my music on STORM
Got a ticket just for blowin my, HORN (ba-baaa, ba-ba-ba-baa-baaaa)
Out the window, pinkie ring, princess cut
Five carat stone, ice around my neck
Lookin like some chrome, be at yo' best
We don't play checkers no more, we play chess
One-trey twice double-oh block
H-I-double-L side-shot
All about my fetti y'all
One-time want to see me fall
It's obvious I'm humongous
Acres, cars and businesses
All about my fetti y'all

Used to sell taffy, white girl nasal candy
Used to dress tacky, just so I can bank they dome
Slick 'em, make 'em think I'm broke
Use the dope game as a stepping stone
From corporate now it's NexTel walkie-talkies
I'm the one that really named them faulty chips faulty (faulty chips faulty)
I got the gift of gab, I'm off the choo choo track
I want the fetti, fuck the fame, y'all can HAVE THAT
All about my fetti y'all

Yeah baby

Song you ever heard of
So your momma's and daddy's better close ears
Cause I am about to get explicit

Verse 1:

Relax bitch
And take off your fucking coat
Call me the bay
About to rock your fucking boat
You said sing a song
So I sang to you
11 long bitchs
Yeah bitch and I'm blaming it
Throw those big wet thighs on my shoulders
While I attack it like a motherfucking soldier
You said you love me
Scream a little louder bitch
I can't tell from the moans and groans and shit
I am straight sweating my dick is on pause
Slow down baby lets take it to and fro
I feel it coming can you handle the nut
This shit feels hella good awww fuck straight

Course:

Your dick feels so good
Feels so good to me

Verse 2:

I guess it's tongue time
Put you knees to the floor
Take your time baby
Your lips are kind of cold
I never thought she would suck me this right
You suck my dick like a rap on the mic
That's good honey so do it like that
You like the way it feels to suck a big mack?
You went down like you knew your righteous place
You little freak wipe that cum off your face
Don't swallow it to fast
Take time to savor it
Use your tongue and be a bitch and play with it
Do it real good make my knees weak
And tell it how it feels young freak

Course:
Your dick feels so good
Feels so good to me

Verse 3:
Take it out
Take the dick and steoke it
Put it in your mouth but don't choke bitch
Suck me fuck me lick me freak me

Yeah bitch it's the 1990 love song

Course:

Your dick feels so good
Feels so good to me

Outro:

Think I am way too explicit
But guess what your daughter like it
Bye baby[ VERSE 1 ]
Smellin' stale fresh out the county jail
Coppers gave me hell in a cell
But now its Mo' Murder to make mail
They thought my heart was playin' life at a different pitch
But I stick to the script, dump a snitch in a ditch
It's '94 I can't be fuckin' around
Paranoia of a jack so I'm quick to drop down
The only way I gets my mail is to be offin' yo' ass
With a AK or a Uzi screamin'"give me your cash nigga"
So back to fuck on up
Cause can't nobody stop this nigga that's sellin a D that's raw and uncut
Fuckin' over fiends
Laughin' in their faces sellin' soap to niggas, could die any day
Niggas come showin' up in them jacks, G
Another homie eyes wide open dead in my backseat
We never thought that they would get him
My nigga fuck like it's over we'd never knew that the bullet hit him
Thought to myself was cocaine with my homie's life
He picked the crime Do or Die now he pays the price
To look in struggle on his face with his gat in his hand
My nigga died with the face of a desperate man

[ Hook ] 2 X
So we can tear this face
We can tear this face
The face of a desperate man , Gyeah-man

[ VERSE 2 ]
Check motherfuckin one check one two
I gotta gets my mail, that's what I gotta do
And don't nobody run up on me
Cause Franklin and Grant is my only motherfuckin' homie
I made a deal with the devil and sold my soul
Threw up off O.E. at fourteen-years old
Young hog ass nigga never ever soft
Got me a strap and learned not to shoot my balls off
And all the youngsters sneakin' pass the bottle
Because the Gs, pimps, and hustlers was the motherfuckin' role model
And every time we had a house party
It was just the chance for a nigga to see another nigga dead body
And nobody stayed around for sequels
Cause the nigga that was bustin' was spreadin' bullets 'round equal
Now they mobbin', I'm seein' sparks hearin' shots
Pistols pop, another motherfucker flop
On the asphalt, stuck by the fo'-fo'
Flatline, ambulance put him in the do'
Loud screams from his homies yellin' "I'mma smoke 'em!"
Feelin' bad cause his partner's own blood choked him
A touchin' scene, niggas screamin' in the rain
Looked in his homeboy's face, his homie said his name
Now he'll be lookin' for that nigga with the gat and
Ready for that red rum with the face of a desperate man

[ Hook ]

'94 is gettin' hostile nigga
I gotta watch my shit, mug on my face nigga, hound dog mean bitch
I'm muggin' every nigga that be walkin' by
Is it true can his hand be quicker than my eye?
I'm wonderin' if I gotta pull out my steel
Cause motherfuckers they can't feel me they won't look at me real
So fo' to the motherfuckin fo'
If I have to let 'em know not to play me like a ho
Cause I sticks to the G code
I unloads the clizip and ease on down the road
1 and 1 Spice only
I do my dirt all by my motherfuckin lonely (by myself nigga)

[ Hook ]

Spiggedy 1 with up on that ass

BLaaaow Blam 187
Straight murder display from LA to the Bay
Westside, My nigga Spice 1 aka Fetty Chico
And I'll be Mack 10 aka Mack Manson
What up Spice

[Verse 1: Spice 1]
We serving chickens you damn sure can't get at Roscoe's
If you don't want to see no murder then keep your eyes closed
Nigga shake the dice up, roll 'em if it's one or ten
They won't be able to put your ass together again
Leave you in Reece's Pieces, rolling in white cornices
Knocking out teethes, I know where we can get the blackheads cheapest
From my homie down the street on the block
He copping everything from Desert Eagles down to them mini-Glocks
If niggas fuck off the money we raise the murder stats
Me and my nigga Mack 10 committing terrorist acts
You see us bailing don't mumble under your breath
Have the heart to say fuck you so I can put five in your chest nigga
Don't be no punk, I put my Uzi where my mouth is
Yay under couches running out of crack houses
We down and dirty for the birdy thirty-five a sack
Nigga give up the stack it's Fetty Chico and The Mack

[Hook: Spice 1]
Fetty Chico and The Mack
(Murder Murder) Ma-A-Mack 10 shooter, kill a man looter
Fetty Chico And The Mack
(Murder Murder) Open up your mouth, Say Ahh, get
Ready for the Blaaoow
Fetty Chico and The Mack
(Murder Murder) Ma-A-Mack 10 shooter, kill a man looter
Fetty Chico And The Mack
(Murder Murder) Open up your mouth, Say Ahh, get
Ready for the Blaaoow

[Verse 2: Mack 10]
I'm in a murderous mindstate
I'm on so much dope and coke I can't even do my line straight
I smoke that warren that shit put me in a trance
And since my last LP they start calling me Mack Manson
Now when I come around punks know they're gone
Smell my pistol around and fall straight into a coma
So take if you want it that's my number one motto
Hitting licks like the lotto, with a four-five bottle
And assault rifles like Rambo full of ammo
Dump a nigga in his chest and watch him bleed through his flesh
???...... chicken hawking
You kill a nigga, you kill his bitch so she can't talk
So I smoked the bitch and made it simple
I put one in her temple and got horny as a nympho
So with a hard dick and guns, a bad bitch dies
I take my two fingers and then I slowly close her eyes

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Spice 1]
Capping him in his b-brain, with the m-mack t-ten
That's my p-partner we d-d-doing him in
L-l-leave him in the t-trunk
'til his c-crazy kid kicks one in the ch-chamber off
The s-safety
I g-got 'em g-got 'em four extra c-clips
Infra-red b-beam h-hollow tips
D-dirty l-licks m-midnight
M-Mack W-One O and l-laser sights
R-rollin b-blunts smoking to the doobie
In my h-hooptie with my uzi t-talking to me
Telling me thought another lick we can go pull off
He told me keep your mask on don't take your hood off
So me bail into Burger King and me pistol whip the guard
Everybody up on the floor nobody try to make it hard
Another guard was hiding he jumped out and bust at me
So I let him count the bullets in my C-L-I-P
Me hear them sirens ringing and me take off with the stack
Bailing without the stretch it's Fetty Chico and The Mack
187-187-187-187-Blaaaow

Hey check it out boy we fittin' ta do this shit Shorty-B

And my boy gonn' come tight you know what I'm sayin'
That's all it take ya know
So we fittin' ta do this shit and get paid like a mutha fucka
Spice kick it

Verse 1: Spice 1

187 is fuckin' it up cause we be blowsin'
Takin' out weak mutha fuckas wit the explosion
I put my finger on trigger and he was rolled up
Was it my nine, my nigga that had him fold up
I kep' on bustin' and bustin' and cappin' cappin' y'all
Until I emptied the clip out cause I was snappin' y'all
The was the S-P-I-C-E-187 the murda
I put the nine in my pocket all of a sudden I heard a
Siren, A-K shots firin'
It was the fuzz so I figured the room was wired an'
Broke out the backdoor because the backdoor was open
So when the cop told me freeze, Yo he fuckin' gotta be jokin'
Fuck all the bullshit, I'm poppin' two in the brain
Was it a 187 or just a ghetto thang

Chorus: Ant Banks

Ghetto thang, ghetto thang (x2)
"Ah yeah, you know what I'm sayin'
Hey Spice do that shit nigga"

Verse 2: Spice 1

A be for acres and J be likely ta jack
By the Faculty mutha fucka for short it's the Fac
Blast, like a hurricane and blow out you fuckin' brains
I can't be tamed I'm insane to the membrane
Doper than D-boys, B-l-a-s-t toys
Wanna get static then homie you can just bring the noise
Spice 1'll put the vision in black, can you fuck wit that
You know I like the funky rata-tata-tat-tat
Of a U-Z-I, cause it sound fly
When your sayin' die mother fucker die
S-P-I C-E and wit the Faculty
A quarterback throwin' a rhyme now could you tackle me
Boy, you must'a had an almond joy
Huh, this ain't no child's play I'm worse than Chuckie he' a toy

Chorus: Ant Banks

Ghetto thang, ghetto thang (x2)
"Shorty-B break it down homie
Ah yeah, you know what I'm sayin', it ain't nuttin' but a"
Ghetto thang, ghetto thang
"Shorty-B is in the house, hey yo Spice
Bring the dope shit right about now"

Verse 3: Spice 1

Well it's the mutha fuckin' S the P the I the C-E
Not in a homocide nigga you might as well be
Lifestyles of ruthless, thought he was juicey and tried to juice this
Fuck wit the posse but yo was useless
Can't stop the jack of the fuckin' Fac
The bum rush'll crush a mutha fuckas back
Spice 1 comin' straight outta Alkatraz
Wit a posse that'll probably fuck up the task
A lot of niggas try ta step to the murderism
But all they get is a mutha fuckin circumcis'm
The 187 the Fac comin' right and exact
You got a static you phoned, you better call me back
Cause I don't sucker round, nor do I fuck around
And you can tell this by the mangled body stuck around

Chorus:

Ghetto thang, ghetto thang (x4)
"This shit is on in the '91
Out this muther fucker
Do that shit homie
Ah yeah Ant Banks is in tha mutha fuckin' house
Spice 1 is takin' over shit in the '91 boy
Triad records is in the house
Ant Banks is in the house, Shorty-B is in the muther fuckin' house
And we out the mutha fuckin' house
For all those muther fuckers who didn't know"Chorus:
Gotta get some lovin' (repeated)

Too $hort:
Gotta get me some pussy
Biotch
What's really goin' on?
Yeah, $hort Dog's in the house
Funky Fresh, Biotch

[Verse 1]
I seen you walking down the street had to stop
Turned up the radio, dropped the top
Say ya look so good, you're so fine
I'll take ya to my house, we'll spend some time
I know you feel me, you need to find me
And give me head while I'm doin' about 90
Biotch, believe it or not, I'm bout to come up
What's up with the Cop?
I'll get you in my car, let you work that tounge
Drivin' to my house, we'll have some fun
But this ain't no Too $hort freaky tale
Cause right now I'm goin' through a dry spell
Stopped fuckin' with the hoes, just ride and look
Dip to the house to get the porno books
Thinkin' to myself I gotta knock a bitch
I gotta get some pussy, man fuck this shit

Chorus

[Verse 2]
Bounced to the house all by myself
Can't get no pussy and I'm mad as hell
Cause magazines can't even do the trick
I guess I have to watch me a porno flick
Popped in the movie, they start fuckin'
He was lickin', she was suckin'
I watched them ol' nasty freaks
Wishin' that shit might happen to me
I got a beep and got juiced up hommie
Looked at my pager and it said "Tone Only"
I need a bitch that wanna give me some
Loves givin' head just to make me cum
Freak Nasty all on my dick
Just like the ho in the porno flick
I went to bed without fuckin' a bitch
I gotta get some pussy man fuck this shit

Chorus:

[Verse 3]
I need a bitch, so I can get me some
She'll lick on these nuts and then make me cum
Get real freaky, had her pussy wet
Ease on in like an Oakland vet
Lay your ass down by the fireplace
Stick my dick in your mouth, let you have a taste
Of this skinny motherfucker with a big ol' dick
I'll let you ride it right after you lick it
See I come from the city of dope
]From the mouth to the pussy and back down your throat
I gotta get some, I keep thinkin' of sex
I wonder who'll call my beeper next
I keep callin' hoes, ain't no one home
And like a punk motherfucker I'm all alone
So I told myself, I'm knockin' a bitch
I gotta get some pussy man fuck this shit

Chorus:

Where it's at

[Verse 3]
Back on the streets and it's on again
Bumped a little freak named Sonja San
She jumped in the car and we started to ride
Just graduated from Oakland High
18 years, thick as hell
She look kinda young, but my dick can't tell
Ride through the town with my sunroof open
Thinkin' about the pussy, man, just hopin'
Later on, some Hennessay and Tangeray
Will have her ass so high, I get to fuck today
I hit a corner, and seen her Pops
She waved to him, smiled and told her "Stop"
I pulled over, looked at her father
He took one look and said, "You can't mess with partner"
I had to leave without my young bitch
Can't get no pussy man fuck this shit

Chorus to fade[E-40 having a playalistic converstaion]
Hoppin over barbed wire fences nigga
Had this one broad right, SHE was so damn sprung
She used to hold my motherfuckin.. motherfuckin sack, nigga!
Thought you thought, nigga
In a motherfucking VHS, uh.. motherfucking canister
Nigga, yeah ay, I promise you nigga this game been so damn good
(Said this rap game's been good to me)
Hard times
(But I don't know how long that's gonna be..)

[Hook: Otis & Shugg] (2x)
Hope I don't go back to slangin yayo
Slangin yayo, to get my maillll

[Verse 1]
Been a hustler since birth, mama sellin dinners for the church
Red-handed, caught me stealin money out her purse
Got branded, permanent whip scars on my back
Cause I used to get beat, with racing car tracks
But now me got wealth, holdin a conference call on my
Hands free car telephone lookin like I'm talkin to myself
Shootin the breeze cuttin it up real smooth like
Choppin it up like true business men
Talkin about it, by the way
B - what we doin' this week on SoundScan?
If I ain't in Japan, I'm in the Valley
Or maybe next door in Gary Payton bowling alley
Or maybe at the shootin range, me and Banks
Or on the golf course, with Merton Hanks
Or we lay in the sun, give me my propers
With a beat that's out of this world, lookin down on doctors
Sippin on Port, watchin my kids play basketball
In the backyard on a 40 by 63 foot long sports court
Biatch!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Business spot up in the wilderness, coyotes and wild boars
Dupont registry aluminum pool table made strictly for outdoors
Twenty inch gold super Bravos on my ? everybody ain't able
To be blessed with success with an independent-ass record label
Check it out, marbles, I got the game from my Uncle Saint Char-les
Used to bank across the street at Wells Fargo
But now it's Merrill Lynch
And just think, I used to sit the bench
I remember gettin chased by the cops, had to get my stomach pumped
Full of a quarter ounce of rocks, late afternoon
Po-po waitin for me outside of Vallejo Kaiser Permanente
Emergency room with Glocks, ready to Rodney King me to death
Somehow I managed to make my escape through
The back of the cafeteria by the vending machine department quickly
Found myself runnin through the Friendship Apartment Complex
Over there by the railroad tracks, around the corner from the
People's Continuation High School
Somewhere off in Lofas, behind Je-nai's Liquor ooh

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Get my mail, check it out, dope game ain't goin
Now it seems the, white-collared crimes, are hookin up phones
"Charlie Hustle, I got a few mathmatics
I'm doing a compilation, should I go with Phunky Phat Graph-X?
I tell them, "Hell yeah that's a done deal, dude them be off the hinges
Dude them did my cover and my bus benches"
Game warrior invested, worldwide Sick-Wid-It shit, independent chips
BEYOOOOOOOOOTCH!
Ay see ay, I'mma tell you nigga
That's the thing about this whole thing that
Jump off
It's a fool cause a muh'fucka take his bloody money right
Until
He sit up there and he look and he say
"Hold on man, hold on man"
Muh'fucka, yknowmsayin?
You can either be at this shit
Or you can be gone
With this shit
And you look at it and then he say, "Man hold on
Let me translate this shit - let me translate into some marbles
Let me liquidate my motherfuckin revenelles"
You understand what I'm sayin? 40-Water now, you understand?
Ay, ay, but look, check this out
I'm here to sprinkle motherfuckers, lace they tennis shoes
Teach them about the motherfuckin game-orienfested situations
That goes down in the motherfuckin motherfuckin soils weepolations
I ain't bullshittin niggas!

[Overlaps Hook]
I don't bullshit!
I ain't bullshittin nigga!

[Otis & Shugg]

Don't wanna go back - back to the game, heyyyy

[Outro]
To get your mail, BEYOOOOOOOTCH!Intro:D-Wiz and Spice 1
"Hey yo Spice, what's goin' on man
That sound like 5-0 over there, is that 5-0?
Same mutha fuckas that beat my homie down last week
But I ain't trippin' I got the 187 proof by my side it's fittin' ta be on
Is that right, but where you stayin' at man, what's goin' on
Same mutha fuckin' neighborhood man
Just tryin' ta get this shit off the ground this rap thang, ya know
Yeah I heard that shit, let these niggas know what time it is
Yeah, check it"

Verse 1
I like to walk around my hood smokin' dank a lot
I see some brothers in the trees as they slangin' rocks
Runnin' through a broken down wooden fence
A nigga didn't have brains cause he smoked sinse
Or sess or whatever you wanna call it
He got the task on his ass better haul it
Fiends suckin' up the crack in the backyard
Dropped a pebble on the ground now he's lookin' hard
Will he keep searchin' or will he cease and just forget the hit
Or pull a jack move, and let the nine click
I'm in a cut late night about twelve o'clock
I see some brothas bustin' caps in a parkin' lot
There go my homie rollin' up in a black Vette
Nuthin' but the money for the paycheck
Another day a brother dead in the alleyway
That's what the boys in the Bay up in Cali say
The California life, task in the palm trees
Brothers be clockin' g's, slangin' keyes
Up in my neighborhood
In my neighborhood

Verse 2
Funk, is a part of my life
It's the sounds of the gangsta Spice
One, check out the blast of a shotgun
Nine mutha fuckin' milimeter have one
Or two or three or four
Cause every brother in my hood is hardcore
Boom boom to the death of a cop
Pop pop pop, see another one drop
See a crazy ass nigga off the peppermint snappes
And now ya wonder why niggas slangin' hoppe
Never would'a thought I'd be a deala o' dope
Niggas slangin' and bangin' and breakin' necks and throats
The spot it was poppin', but yet the fuzz kept ridin' my jock
Tick-tock, I watch the clock, they flock
See a undercover cop raise off the block
That's how it is in the game a slangin' rocks
Cause on the t.v. they make him look real good
But Mr.Rogers ain't got shit on my niggas up in neighborhood
In my neighborhood

Verse 3
Welcome to the ghetto, although I call it my neighborhood
Some people get out, but some people stay for good
I see a dope fiend yellin' he's a O.G
He scratch his head and starts starin' like he knows me
I said what up man I seen your face before
It was my homies pop, shirt dirty, pant's tore
He had a 40 in his hand left a little swallow
He said young ass nigga and then he threw the bottle
I ducked down and I had to talk real fast
I stepped two feet back and then I ganked his ass
I started kickin' and stompin' my niggas brains out
I heard a bitch yell freeze and runnin' out the house
It was his wife and his bitch started bustin' at me
I can't believe this shit this bitch is trigga happy
Pulled out my nine and bust the bitch in the left titty
That's how it is in a burnt-out dope fiend city
And now your sayin' I'm the nigga up to no good
I gives a fuck if your bullshit get jacked up in my neighborhood
