[Verse 1]

I love a boss that ain't scared to get his beard wet
Daddy fly, I wanna ride him like a learjet
Keep it real, I ain't going for no weird shit
Got him calling every second asking are you here yet?
He just like to hear me say i'm cummin'
He asking questions like whose is it when I fuck him
I tell him lies like it's yours and I love it
I'm just tryna get my nut and then it's right back to hustling
Nina Macc, I'm just out here tryna function
You lusting and it's nothing, you just better show me something
Remember suck don't lick, ooh don't stop, right there that's it

[Hook]

I sit on ya face it taste just like candy
I sit on ya face it taste just like candy
I sit on ya face it taste just like candy
I sit on ya face it taste just like candy
It taste just like candy
I sit on ya face it taste just like candy
It taste just like candy
I sit on ya face it taste just like candy
Just like candy, just like candy
Just like, just like, just like candy
Just like candy, just like candy
I sit on ya face it taste just like candy

[Verse 2]

These hoes lost, they need a role model badly
I got more game than their so-called daddy
Champagne sipping, you niggas sip brandy
I sit on your face it tastes just like candy
I don't suck dick, I swallow that shit
I don't lease whips I'm a balling-ass bitch
Let me give you game, I know you broke ho's jokes
I don't charge by the hour shit I charge by the stroke
Gentlemen it's the Emacc show
I want the luxury sedan, I ain't no E-Class ho
These bum niggas tryna talk me out my chips
They ain't got nothing to offer, I don't even want the dick
Soon as I lick my lips they wanna give me kiss
But they can kiss my asshole unless they kissing on this clit
Remember suck don't lick, ooh don't stop, right there that's it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

And I ain't tryna take your man bitch
Your man's average, ain't nothing but a fan, shit
You doing backflips, bending over backwards
For a nigga that just spent a couple racks with
A boss bitch and all I gave him was a lap dance
Got my legs wrapped around his stomach like The Lap-Band
I'm in his brain so he nicknamed me CAT Scan
Tapped out broke, now that's what I call a tap dance
I'm running circles 'round these bitch niggas
He working hard while I'm working on his six figures
They got the nerve to try and label me a gold digger
But I'm a hustler, definition of a go-getter
They say the game's to be sold not told nigga
I been riding Benz since I was nineteen years old nigga
Remember suck don't lick, ooh don't stop, right there that's it

[Hook][Hook: Nate Dogg]
This is where I wanna be
Right here with my loved ones
Smokin on some weed
You've got chronic won't you light it up?

[Verse 1: Shade Sheist]
Now who's that kickin in the gate for the West?
Shade pop with flows that seep holes in your vest
Half nigga with the words
Half run up in your spot to talk shit
Where I'm from, we prone to lick shots
Now Dogg Pound Gangstas put me up on game (put me up on game)
Now that I'm here a lot of shit gon' change
Mister quick to buy a chain, mister let the chain hang
Showin off to broads, I'm mister quick to get to bang
Now you might catch Sheist gettin bent in every coast
Still the nigga with the heat gettin rid of every coat
Still fuckin with Mizz, we run triz when we bored
And you know I got the X, twenty's what they hittin for
See me if you wanna score, cause I got what you need
Or you can see me in the club, tinted SUV
Gettin in for free, I'm bout to make my name known
Sheist pull a heist in this bitch just to get it on (what.)

[Verse 2: Nate Dogg]
Check this out
You see, how I figure this thing
We can, all take over this game
If we, come together do this shit right
We can, all have a piece of the pie
You know, how I figured this out
I just, took a little trip down South
Soon as, I set foot off the plane
It was, just like a family thing
You know, the gangsta's hard to decieve
So I, took a little trip to the East
I'm not, slow so I can't wait for the game
I'm not, broke so I'm in bulletproof everything
When I, touch down it ain't like a think
They ain't, trippin off nothin but bank
So I, quickly dispose of my shank
If we, if we ain't got us nigga where could we hang?

[Hook: Nate Dogg]

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
Yeah, show me somethin I ain't never seen
I step in the house party with a gangsta lean
Dogg Pound Gangstas we strikin back again (back again)
Ready to ride in the 'lac again {*tires squeal*}
Givin it up for T-Boz and Mack 10 for doin it
This ain't nothin but a gangsta reunion
New York and California, the places to be

Took that money broke it down and threw it on freak

I got a couple bucks if you need some rent
That's insurance money it won't give me a damn thing
Let alone a muthafuckin' dent

Left side of the comma always sittin' three figures
Left side of my garage is where I keep that G-Wigga
Left side of the map all that shit should read Nina

[Hook]

Yeah I'm west coast royalty

You know that I was named after the chrome thing
And if you ever fucked with me you know you paid me
You know paid me, you know paid me
Like the first and fifteenth you know you paid me
If you fuckin' me baby you know you fuckin' royalty

[Verse 2]

Make money, spend money do another video
Another song, make a movie I don't even know

Will have me flaking on that ass, yeah I won't even show
They say that I'm a fake bitch
But I'm ballin' and you frontin' like you fake rich
He said they was gon' hate this
And he was right but I told him they don't fade this
I ain't on the Gram tryna get likes

And now I use this music as a double-up

Yo, life is a lesson niggas who don't study
End up failing test and blame it on me(what)
But see Sheist only gets what he claiming to be
A real quiet motherfucker with his heart in the streets
Hot in these beats, flow sell a lot in a week
So even Billboard couldn't drop my highest of peaks
I'm with the breaks so you knowin' what they saying to me
I'm impressed how many people end up hating on me
Like a disease Shade hittin' wit' a new vaccine

(Warren G)
Real Talk

Hah-ha yeah yeah[Verse 1]

Stack it up high, I don't know about low
These Giuseppes, I don't know about those
Naked life, I don't know about clothes
And I walk on rose petals, I don't know about floors
Cause in my business, Baby anything goes
If you stroll through my building with a duffle full of dough
You know, you better come through with a row
And it would be nice if you pulled up in a Rolls
Damn I'm so demanding, hope you understanding
Cause I ain't got time if you don't got ends
Cause I don't need romancing, I'm into cash advances
So nigga pay me up, no I ain't got friends
Talk is cheap and you sounding real stingy
Like a small dick, doing shit for free just ain't in me
Pop them dollars off the clip just like a semi
And I'll show you exactly what I do in your city, be like ugh

[Hook]

I'm in the business of breakin' niggas
I'm in the business of breakin' it down
I'm in the business of breakin' niggas

[Verse 2]

Now back to the lecture at hand
That's only assuming that lecture really means bands

And me I'm like damn
I was just fuckin around and now I'm breakin it down, be like bam

[Hook]* from the forthcoming "Informal Introduction"

{*scratching*}

[Verse: Shade Sheist]
Yo, it ain't nothin' new (ain't nothin'), just a change in the name
Sheist done came and changed the game unexplained
Ways for days show you how to wait for your pay
Cause when Shade fuck up your sales, all your checks delay
And now niggas mad cause Shade can pull up in a Jag
Hands free, chaperone all gettin' the door
And I ain't even interested in stealing your whore
So why these niggas actin like they wanna marry the floor?
Like they ain't seen me breeze past all the gaurds at the door
Like I'm just wearin' this jacket to be hot
I flash the juice card, man this shit ain't hard
And It's the same thing at the same spot
What's my name?

[Chorus] (2x)
[Vocoder Box:]It's John Doe
[DJ Quik:] 4-5's spittin' up outta the
[Vocoder Box:]Four Door
[DJ Quik:] No return fire cause they
[Vocoder Box:]Too slow {*gunshots*}
[DJ Quik:] What's the dilly?
[Vocoder Box:] Cause we kill for a living
[DJ Quik:] We kill for a livin'

[Verse: Shade Sheist]
They wanna know why I keep it so simple
I see that they just don't get it like my Nextel signal
Sheist on some other shit, Centinella gutter shit
Cards on the table, you can hit me or split
And see now I fucked around and got Quik on the shit
So just imagine how many hips break when they dip
And all the excessive paper cuts from counting the grip
And how my legs hurt from humpin' back and forth in the whip
At only 35, coverage is a bitch on a six
And I ain't even got my first plaque yet (plaque yet)
Sheist, will still run circles over niggas who want it
And we ain't even gotta make the bets yet
Nigga what's my name?

[Chorus] (2x)

[Verse: Hi-C]
Throat-choke a ho, Big Giggolo
Pimp the world, handcuff your ho
Twurk your girl, when I step into the atmosphere
Niggas strapped wit fear, uh!
Is he is what I said he is and all
When I pimp bitches all dick and balls
Shade Sheist nothin' nice, new to the game
Get your money homie, bitch what's my name?

[Verse: AMG]
Hey-hey! we gon' hit these niggas where it hurt (uh)
Put the worm in your mouth like a perch (uh)
When I'm cum boo you gon' need a cert
Bust one, jump in the Monte Carlo and skirt (skirt!)
Give em naps, give 'em dap, then I holla holla back
"Hey nigga where you goin'?"
Boo I'm checkin' my traps
Yall niggas done shitted and stepped back in it
I'll fuck a nigga up all I need is five minutes

[Verse: Swift]
Swift, and I pimp hoes like it's a gift
I got game so you know I'm "The Answer" like Allen I
Got your whole style shook like 'Quilles or Kobe Bry'
While money multiply you haters ask why
No you can't stop the pimpin' the pimpin' is too fly
Runnin' game on yo wife while you out flossin' your ride
But she said, "if you ain't busy, or close in the vicinity
Stop on by and come get the thighs."

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
[Vocoder Box:]It's John Doe
[DJ Quik:] 4-5's spittin' up outta the
[Vocoder Box:]Four Door
[DJ Quik:] No return fire cause they
[Vocoder Box:]Too slow {*gunshots*}
[DJ Quik:] What's the dilly?
[Vocoder Box:] Cause we kill for a living
[DJ Quik:] And we hungry nigga

{*gunshots*}[Hook: Nate Dogg]

Every time I feel the music
Man I loose it
Every time
Every time I fell the music
Man I loose it
Every time

[Verse 1: Shade Sheist]

Yo, check it, check it out
Yo, uh-huh
Shiest the vet, fresh out your ghetto tape decks
It's me and Nate back at it with another for your neck
Another for a check means, Another for the set green
Is what I need to get, Cali's where I wanna be
And I ain't got to lie about the hood or the city
Shade straight from the sue of Jerry up where it's shitty
I got a mouth on me, farthest thing from being pretty
As I cash a check compliments of Nate and Dogg Pound-dation
Shade move the feet of every nation
Kids got the beast now, Trey about to eat now
We both got a plan to leave them haters in they sleep now
Soakin' in the sweat from the heat from the speaks now

[Hook: Nate Dogg]

[Verse 2: Nate Dogg]

There ain't, no way I'm missing my call
Suddenly fall fucking with y'all
Homie can't you; see me trying to get paid
Everyday any kinda way
There ain't, no way you taking my bang
Let your ass think your pussy don't stank
Hell no, you got it all wrong
You need to move on, I'm singing my song
Tell me, can you feel the beat
Is it, moving your feet?
Cause it, surely moves me
Well then, ok let's be on our way
Shade Shiest and big Nate
Just let the beat bang

[Hook: Nate Dogg][Verse 1]

Stack it up high, I don't know about low
These Giuseppes, I don't know about those
Naked life, I don't know about clothes
And I walk on rose petals, I don't know about floors
Cause in my business, Baby anything goes
If you stroll through my building with a duffle full of dough
You know, you better come through with a row
And it would be nice if you pulled up in a Rolls
Damn I'm so demanding, hope you understanding
Cause I ain't got time if you don't got ends
Cause I don't need romancing, I'm into cash advances
So nigga pay me up, no I ain't got friends
Talk is cheap and you sounding real stingy
Like a small dick, doing shit for free just ain't in me
Pop them dollars off the clip just like a semi
And I'll show you exactly what I do in your city, be like ugh

I'm in the business of breakin' niggas
I'm in the business of breakin' it down
I'm in the business of breakin' niggas

To the compound pal
You'll be broke when I come to your town

[Verse 2]

Who are all these phonies on my way to getting money

They moving they bodies and all my records in demand
And me I'm like damn

[Hook][Verse 1]

Funny niggas and bitches, they leave some funny-ass comments
Me I'm blowing up just like a muthafuckin' comet
Seriously though all you fools need to stop it
When my album drops you muthafuckas gon' cop it
Tryna' play me dirty like your granny's old carpet
But this ain't no accident in these streets like when two cars hit
Compare me to who? Fool, better pause it
Cause if they wanna battle these bitches already lost it
Swear I got bars, swear I got bars
If these niggas want my time then I swear I'm gon' charge
If they want a sixteen, swear I'm going harder than their little-ass dicks
And I swear I'ma go longer

[Hook]

I'm Steady Staccn and you know this shit for real
Niggas caught feelings but these niggas knew the deal
I'm never stopping got it popping like pills
I'm new, I'm fresh, nah I'm factory sealed
Brand New, I'm fresh, nah I'm factory sealed
Brand New, I'm fresh, nah I'm factory sealed
I'm so fresh, nah I'm factory sealed
Keep doing what I'm doing, give a fuck of how you feel

[Verse 2]

I changed my number on you bitch niggas
So when you call all you gonna hear is nonsense
Just like I did when you was here nigga
My present is the future and I ain't into the past tense
I'm into getting cash and putting my ass inside of fast whips
To get me to it faster, couldn't do that up in your shit
I'm making moves and now it seems you catching feelings
While I'm catching dollars falling from the ceiling, Muthafucker it's on
I swear that I'm on and if these bitches wanna trip
Well then I swear that they gone
I'm new and improved I got a vet to show me moves
And now I'm all above the rim just like an alley-oop do
A big league bitch, you 'bout to see me switch
Up on these phonies like a dress rehearsal, show's at six
But a can you blame me? Fuck that, can you pay me
Cause I'm all about the dollar, anything else is maybe[Verse 1: Shade Sheist]
They tried to tell me it was over but these niggas lied
I came back on that ass why they act surprised
Shout out to Robin Harris..
Yeah bitch we're like bebe kids we don't die
We multiply you hear that shit
That means there's more than only one of us that's up in yo whip
When you hittin them dips and you got our shit bangin
Just know that on the other side of Earth they be hangin
And they listen to this they pumpin they fists
Up in the air like they sockin all the clouds in they lips
And bustin them shits we puffin them spliffs
You funkin with me that means you funkin with this
Now ride with a nigga coincide with a nigga
If I'm outside of the club they go inside with a nigga
That's word to Nate Dogg.. that's word to Eazy
That's word to Pac none of these niggas can see me When I'm on this funk!

[Hook: Shade Sheist]
I live for the funk I die for the funk
In fact when I pass just bury me in a trunk
And I know what I say sounds crazy
Still ain't nuthin but a g thang baby
And uh, if you don't like it then you ain't gotta call
And it's still above the law (aww)
I might be stuck in the past but yo you got no future
Cause no matter what u say muthafucker GFUNKISFOREVER

[Verse 2: Shade Sheist]
I remember Dj Quik told me in 98
That life is much too short to not be fly and not be great
So I put em together and now bitch this is bigger than The Empire State
That vampire state them suckas be in
Where they sleepin on the funk but follow all them weak trends
Niggas wearin miniskirts as some grown men
Tryna play it off as fashion real niggas don't pretend
I'll never need a gimmick just so you can see me kick it
I'll never wear a dress who you tryna impress
Homie this the West.. no.. We The Best
We wear Chuck Taylors and we never smoke stressa
And if you think I'm dissin then you clearly didn't listen
To the intro of my album in which case you would be missin
The whole damn purpose of this muthafuckin mission
Is to the bring back the funk and now that I got yo attention.. listen

[Verse 3: Shade Sheist]
Bang bang boogie da bang da bang boogie
To da boogie bang boogie da bang
Fuck what you sayin nigga this is bangin this is bangin
This is bangin.. yea.. (i'm guilty)
So you can sue me or try to prove me
Wrong with my song but you'll never overrule me
Conclude me or even outdo me
The 90's was the trailer, this the muthafuckin movie[Verse 1]

I love a boss that ain't scared to get his beard wet
Daddy fly, I wanna ride him like a learjet
Keep it real, I ain't going for no weird shit
Got him calling every second asking are you here yet?
He just like to hear me say i'm cummin'
He asking questions like whose is it when I fuck him
I tell him lies like it's yours and I love it
I'm just tryna get my nut and then it's right back to hustling
Nina Macc, I'm just out here tryna function
You lusting and it's nothing, you just better show me something
Remember suck don't lick, ooh don't stop, right there that's it

[Hook]

I sit on ya face it taste just like candy
I sit on ya face it taste just like candy
I sit on ya face it taste just like candy
I sit on ya face it taste just like candy
It taste just like candy
I sit on ya face it taste just like candy
It taste just like candy
I sit on ya face it taste just like candy
Just like candy, just like candy
Just like, just like, just like candy
Just like candy, just like candy
I sit on ya face it taste just like candy

[Verse 2]

These hoes lost, they need a role model badly
I got more game than their so-called daddy
Champagne sipping, you niggas sip brandy
I sit on your face it tastes just like candy
I don't suck dick, I swallow that shit
I don't lease whips I'm a balling-ass bitch
Let me give you game, I know you broke ho's jokes
I don't charge by the hour shit I charge by the stroke
Gentlemen it's the Emacc show
I want the luxury sedan, I ain't no E-Class ho
These bum niggas tryna talk me out my chips
They ain't got nothing to offer, I don't even want the dick
Soon as I lick my lips they wanna give me kiss
But they can kiss my asshole unless they kissing on this clit
Remember suck don't lick, ooh don't stop, right there that's it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

And I ain't tryna take your man bitch
Your man's average, ain't nothing but a fan, shit
You doing backflips, bending over backwards
For a nigga that just spent a couple racks with
A boss bitch and all I gave him was a lap dance
Got my legs wrapped around his stomach like The Lap-Band
I'm in his brain so he nicknamed me CAT Scan
Tapped out broke, now that's what I call a tap dance
I'm running circles 'round these bitch niggas
He working hard while I'm working on his six figures
They got the nerve to try and label me a gold digger
But I'm a hustler, definition of a go-getter
They say the game's to be sold not told nigga
I been riding Benz since I was nineteen years old nigga
Remember suck don't lick, ooh don't stop, right there that's it

[Hook][Hook]

These bitches need a role model
They need a mother figure, need a fucking bottle
When I'm in the club they in my whole aisle
Just thirsty as fuck, what these hoes problem
These bitches need a role model
If they got a brain then it must be hollow
I'm out here getting money you just tryna follow
Just thirsty as fuck what these hoes problem

[Verse 1]

Stack it like me, no these bitches can't
Seeing these G's, no these bitches ain't
These broads all copy like they paper fake
I'm baggin in dough and I might need a rake
You looking kind of broke like you need a raise
If you don't know your value go and get appraised
Uh, or I can tell ya
Niggas in here, not none of em feel ya
I don't mean to hurt your feelings but
Top dollar only comes to realest of bitches
And you are just a clone and you looking ridiculous
You need to get on and find a new career quickly trick
Some get it, some don't
Some built for this shit, some are just slow
Some hit and some won't
But I ain't 'bout to show a bitch shit no more, just cause

[Hook]

[Verse 2]

So what you got some heels bitch
Now how you 'bout to pay your damn bills bitch
Tryna keep up with the Nina
Your money disappear like some nail polish cleaner
Seen her in that white beamer, you a lie
You seen me in the Benz or that G5
You know we call it that because the shit fly
When I let my seat back like the letter Y
They ain't on my level, get a shovel
Cause I kill 'em all dead in a gold Roley bezel
My level, where you all gone I done been there
Why everybody rocking blonde in they fucking hair
I know, cold game
Break a billion dollars you gon' get some cold change
Best stay in your lane
These hoes don't compare and the fact still remains that, um

[Hook][Verse 1]

First off I wanna give a shout out to my clit
Man, who even says that shit
(You know the radio ain't gon' play this bitch)
Yeah, well they can suck a dick
I made a thousand dollars off a single in a week
Took that money broke it down and threw it on freak
I made ten grand off a trick in a hour
That's your whole quarter sitting by my shower
I don't give no fucks I don't got 'em to give
I got a couple bucks if you need some rent
That's insurance money it won't give me a damn thing
Let alone a muthafuckin' dent
I rep for the bitches who dont need a nigga
Left side of the comma always sittin' three figures
Left side of my garage is where I keep that G-Wigga
Left side of the map all that shit should read Nina

[Hook]

Yeah I'm west coast royalty
I sit on a Throne, I fuck with a L.A. King
You know that I was named after the chrome thing
And if you ever fucked with me you know you paid me
You know paid me, you know paid me
Like the first and fifteenth you know you paid me
If you fuckin' me baby you know you fuckin' royalty

[Verse 2]

Make money, spend money do another video
Another song, make a movie I don't even know
Them good problems cause anything other than the cash
Will have me flaking on that ass, yeah I won't even show
They say that I'm a fake bitch
But I'm ballin' and you frontin' like you fake rich
He said they was gon' hate this
And he was right but I told him they don't fade this
I ain't on the Gram tryna get likes
I ain't up on Twitter tryna follow up
I'm just tryna get my fuckin' paper right
And now I use this music as a double-up
I'm a cold senorita
I'll freeze your bank account, yeah I guaran-fuckin-tee ya'
You for sure gon' see a
Mexican bitch doing excellent shit, cause I'm

[Hook][Verse 1]

Gossip and foolishness, they talking that stupid shit
Nina still rollin through, this track here is proof of it
Now I got an album and I'm acting a fool with it
Cause they call me Hollywood anyways and I'm through with it
Call me Beverly Hills if anything
Cause you more than likely to find me there doing my thang
When I say I'm a boss it's what I mean
When you say you're a boss you spittin dreams
Ain't no maccin' the Macc and that's a fact
I got all these niggas mad and all I did was come back
Like I left something over there and needed that back
So I went and got it quick, now you can't be mad at that

[Hook]

They ain't runnin' nothing, but they mouths
Me I run them numbers to my bank account
Fronting for the world, need to cut it out
And see what a real bitch all about

I'm fresh, I'm she
Factory Sealed, that's me
I'ma do what I do
Try to stop me you a fool

[Verse 2]

Tre why they always tryna' tell me that I'm tryna' be her
When I'm in my own lane and they ain't even on my curb
I came into this game with my own shit
Paid my own way cause I was all up on my own dick
They say I'm too raw but I got tricks
Which means that I'ma be alright if I don't rap shit
I know that's unfair but I don't care
Cause the similarities gotta be more than platinum blonde hair
And they ain't runnin' nothing

[Hook][Hook: Nate Dogg]
This is where I wanna be
Right here with my loved ones
Smokin on some weed
You've got chronic won't you light it up?

[Verse 1: Shade Sheist]
Now who's that kickin in the gate for the West?
Shade pop with flows that seep holes in your vest
Half nigga with the words
Half run up in your spot to talk shit
Where I'm from, we prone to lick shots
Now Dogg Pound Gangstas put me up on game (put me up on game)
Now that I'm here a lot of shit gon' change
Mister quick to buy a chain, mister let the chain hang
Showin off to broads, I'm mister quick to get to bang
Now you might catch Sheist gettin bent in every coast
Still the nigga with the heat gettin rid of every coat
Still fuckin with Mizz, we run triz when we bored
And you know I got the X, twenty's what they hittin for
See me if you wanna score, cause I got what you need
Or you can see me in the club, tinted SUV
Gettin in for free, I'm bout to make my name known
Sheist pull a heist in this bitch just to get it on (what.)

[Verse 2: Nate Dogg]
Check this out
You see, how I figure this thing
We can, all take over this game
If we, come together do this shit right
We can, all have a piece of the pie
You know, how I figured this out
I just, took a little trip down South
Soon as, I set foot off the plane
It was, just like a family thing
You know, the gangsta's hard to decieve
So I, took a little trip to the East
I'm not, slow so I can't wait for the game
I'm not, broke so I'm in bulletproof everything
When I, touch down it ain't like a think
They ain't, trippin off nothin but bank
So I, quickly dispose of my shank
If we, if we ain't got us nigga where could we hang?

[Hook: Nate Dogg]

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
Yeah, show me somethin I ain't never seen
I step in the house party with a gangsta lean
Dogg Pound Gangstas we strikin back again (back again)
Ready to ride in the 'lac again {*tires squeal*}
Givin it up for T-Boz and Mack 10 for doin it
This ain't nothin but a gangsta reunion
New York and California, the places to be
Nate Dogg and Kurupt broadcast for free
We at the DoggHouse where the dogs at
You wanna get with me?
Baby meet me in the back
Young Damion Young, this is number two
Ridin out homie doin what we wanna do

[Hook till fade][Verse 1: Shade Sheist]
Now let's get down to Business.. I know you missed this
Niggas give me daps.. Ladies give me they kisses
Music is delirious the shxt is just senseless
Well that's what they tell me though.. cause I don't listen
I got my motor running like the state of Pistons
I stay making hits through shit you stay pitching
I stay cooking up some funk and this my kitchen
I don't play with with these punks if I forgot to mention
I be smoking a hella lot
Cause life gets complicated like when fixing a helicopter
Karma is bitch but let me see you go try and stop her
Grab her by her arm and I betcha she prolly pop ya.. ha
That's why I feud with a Bitch..
Her actions make me change my views on the bitch
But switch shoes with a bitch
You Gucci but I ain't Jimmy Choo'sin this shit

[Hook: Shade Sheist]
..That's why I'm back in the building
This feeling.. I didn't have last year now I'm chillin
On the Ceiling.. another million
Models from Milan, Some Bitches Be Brazilian
Back in the building
This feeling.. I didn't have last year now I'm chillin
On the Ceiling.. another million
Models from Milan, Some Bitches Be Brazilian..

[Verse 2: Shade Sheist]
And if they ain't I bet they Carribean
Or some other native shit you don't be really seein
Her bra and underwear is European
She prolly got em from a nigga that she likely teasin
And now she switching like a new season
But with dollars in her wallet that's a cool reason
Indoor / Outdoor pool at the mansion
That she just invited me to
Umm.. yeah..
And it don't matter who the owner is
Cause when that nigga outta town you know he gettin his
That's how she justified this lil tryst
Before she spun and broke it down and shook her lil hips
Bitches tell you anything just get the dick
But niggas do the same thang when we lick the clit
I may be speaking from experience..
But ask me if I give a shit

[Hook: Shade Sheist]

[Verse 3: Shade Sheist]
She could even be from Argentina
She could be my partner's sister and i'll call her Gina
Now that's some Scarface shit
And I ain't Manolo so you stay far away bitch
Nah I don't mean to be so damn rude
Cause underneath these G'd up lyrics I'm a good dude
I'm just saying what I'm feelin
And thankful to GOD yall let me back up in this building..
And this feeling..

[Hook: Shade Sheist][TQ]:

(yeah yeah oh oh yeah yeah)

[Verse 1: Shade Sheist]
Yo I'm used to fine hoes

[Chorus: TQ]

[Verse 2: Shade Sheist]
Yo I'm known to snag birds with little to no words
Get em duckin in the truck, before they know what occurred
Hit my where I wanna be skytel alert to gettin em very messy in the spot
Where it hurts
Fuckin up affaris for chickens with long hair
And long legs with ginseng mouths for long hair with pretty eyes above
Big titties and trim thighs, who like them slim guys that rap and stay high
Them niggas who extend heads out expeds them real perverted
Niggas mackin out the club med, who spit the kinda shit that other niggas
Never said to get
The kind of bitches that would love to break beds nigga

[Chorus: TQ]

[Verse 3: TQ]
Yo if you still snatch Dames then we in the same game
TQ Shade Sheist you can add your own name
See how many birds like your baby ree chain
When you step up in the club with a fist ful of dubs and you buy
The whole bar for a price of a car
Won't you see how many birds flock just to see the star
Cuz the worlds his now
Like that nigga with the scar when he makes his movies now
Got it locked like a czar

Chorus x2: TQ[Hook: Nate Dogg]

Every time I feel the music
Man I loose it
Every time
Every time I fell the music
Man I loose it
Every time

[Verse 1: Shade Sheist]

Yo, check it, check it out
Yo, uh-huh
Shiest the vet, fresh out your ghetto tape decks
It's me and Nate back at it with another for your neck
Another for a check means, Another for the set green
Is what I need to get, Cali's where I wanna be
And I ain't got to lie about the hood or the city
Shade straight from the sue of Jerry up where it's shitty
I got a mouth on me, farthest thing from being pretty
As I cash a check compliments of Nate and Dogg Pound-dation
Shade move the feet of every nation
Kids got the beast now, Trey about to eat now
We both got a plan to leave them haters in they sleep now
Soakin' in the sweat from the heat from the speaks now

[Hook: Nate Dogg]

[Verse 2: Nate Dogg]

There ain't, no way I'm missing my call
Suddenly fall fucking with y'all
Homie can't you; see me trying to get paid
Everyday any kinda way
There ain't, no way you taking my bang
Let your ass think your pussy don't stank
Hell no, you got it all wrong
You need to move on, I'm singing my song
Tell me, can you feel the beat
Is it, moving your feet?
Cause it, surely moves me
Well then, ok let's be on our way

But I go with my guns
Ain't no shakin' ass hands
Just clap 'til I'm done
And Us Cali Ass Niggas

Cool up and whips that need back from a loan
And hit clubs wit' hoes
All heavy on my arm

So peep all T-L-C (Yeah!) types freaks
Back on the creep 'til my spot in the middle wit' nowhere
And easy game ova there
Or get 'em mad easy on their underwear

In fact I'm just a underage nigga
Rollin' dirty wit' some major figgas (Yeah!)
But if you wanna test the warders
And see which motha fucka hits the hardest

[Shade Sheist]
Yo I'm leavin y'all stuck in the game
Fucked in the brain (Uhhh)
Mocked around fussin for fame
Pourned in the chains
Most MC's retire like sport leagues
Bad Baseball careers are hit and missed
That's why I turned from the big
And I couped that six
Got the money that I saved
And invest that shit (Tell 'em)
While y'all niggas doing dirt
Yo I'm clean writing rhymes
In the tub wit' some for-fee hands on my spine
Wined and dinned
What's the rich niggas deal
Ain't the way to a tip
They cost more than a meal
Try to swing me a crib
That cost more than a mill'
Wit' this lyrics that you do
More then just fill
And Shade ain't the one that'll pay for your phone (No!)
But Shade be the one that'll buy you a home (Yeah)
And chip up your palms
'til your scar for life
And I decide that you're done
Cuz I need a new wife

[Chorus: Shade Sheist & JD]
Get your head out your ass playboy (playboy)
Get your head out your ass playboy
Stop holding your nuts

Get hot and make bread playboy
Cuz that's what we all live for (All live for)

Get your head out your ass (ahh, we ain't playin')
Stop runnin' your mouth
Get hot and make bread (Why?)
Cuz that's what this shit is all about (Come on)

[Shade Sheist]
It took a nigga nine years
And a trip to G-A
Ought to leave you immature left wit' nothing to say
And after all this I guess I did come a long way
WHAT YOU EXPECT?
That I wouldn't make some hits today
Nah nigga

Remember I'm So So Def too nigga (Yeahhhh)
It's gonna take a world wide poles
For me to frost

Ja Rule, Uh
Shade and Irv Gotti
Niggas don't want none of this

[Ja Rule]
Ladies call me white Kane, pure as snow
Like cocaine, cutiepies powder they nose
I've been preaching to the stars
Ladies be livin real harder
A lot of icons, but consider me God
Born in the seventies
The eighties was growing wit time
Now it's two G nigga
And the world is mine
I was a smart nigga
Figured if he put me on the spot
Wit hot shit bubble me up till I rock
Come put me on the block
In a new form and new sound
For Ja Rule and I'm feeling like I'm too strong
I move on down to D.C., V.A
And I even did as far as Californ-I-A
Come to shit
They fly, they float, they snort, they smoke
Hustle, bag and mope
For more
Down the freeway racing out of control, it's crazy
When you fucking wit Rule it's shady

[Chorus]
Niggas if you hustle and stick 'em
It's your life
Bitches if your Fuckin and striping
It's alright

We all got to eat
So live your life
Niggas
It's alright
Bitches
It's your life

[Shade Sheist]
Now I got to hit you wit some other shit
Sentinella gutta shit
Four sides of the chrome
Flows smack you wit the rubber grip
Never been a nigga, niggas wanna play they cards wit
See me in the dark whip
Better go call your guards quick
Better go hit the block and tell them bitches that shisty shit
Known the freaks face like that yellow bezel ice shit
Similar response, yo that kid spit the nicest
Baby re-intice this, CD's raise they prices
Make a nigga chain, oaid off in a different name
Maid think they got flame, Shade just hit the brain
Me and Ja fucked around and made the teams A-list
Two niggas from two sides, like a 7/10 split bitch

[Chorus 2x]

[Ja Rule]
Niggas from the East
Christ from the gun to the mics
I'm living my life
Running through hell wit no ice
It's a sin
But I'd sell my lost soul to win
Go to bed and die
Then I'd wake up breathing again
Cause I'm all in
Even though shit ain't right
I wake up sweatin my life every night
Help me, is it the devil that going to get me
Or is it God don't feel like being bothered wit me
So hard to hit me, this life a sacrifice
If I grow blind through the dark my kids gonna see the light
If I die young it's cause a nigga too high strung
Got scary love for gun wit too much weed in my lungs
And still niggas screaming Ja the one, the chosen
The God's only begotten son, it's my life

Chorus 2x* from the forthcoming "Informal Introduction"

{*scratching*}

[Verse: Shade Sheist]
Yo, it ain't nothin' new (ain't nothin'), just a change in the name
Sheist done came and changed the game unexplained
Ways for days show you how to wait for your pay
Cause when Shade fuck up your sales, all your checks delay
And now niggas mad cause Shade can pull up in a Jag
Hands free, chaperone all gettin' the door
And I ain't even interested in stealing your whore
So why these niggas actin like they wanna marry the floor?
Like they ain't seen me breeze past all the gaurds at the door
Like I'm just wearin' this jacket to be hot
I flash the juice card, man this shit ain't hard
And It's the same thing at the same spot
What's my name?

[Chorus] (2x)
[Vocoder Box:]It's John Doe
[DJ Quik:] 4-5's spittin' up outta the
[Vocoder Box:]Four Door
[DJ Quik:] No return fire cause they
[Vocoder Box:]Too slow {*gunshots*}
[DJ Quik:] What's the dilly?
[Vocoder Box:] Cause we kill for a living
[DJ Quik:] We kill for a livin'

[Verse: Shade Sheist]
They wanna know why I keep it so simple
I see that they just don't get it like my Nextel signal
Sheist on some other shit, Centinella gutter shit
Cards on the table, you can hit me or split
And see now I fucked around and got Quik on the shit
So just imagine how many hips break when they dip
And all the excessive paper cuts from counting the grip
And how my legs hurt from humpin' back and forth in the whip
At only 35, coverage is a bitch on a six
And I ain't even got my first plaque yet (plaque yet)
Sheist, will still run circles over niggas who want it
And we ain't even gotta make the bets yet
Nigga what's my name?

[Chorus] (2x)

[Verse: Hi-C]
Throat-choke a ho, Big Giggolo
Pimp the world, handcuff your ho
Twurk your girl, when I step into the atmosphere
Niggas strapped wit fear, uh!
Is he is what I said he is and all
When I pimp bitches all dick and balls
Shade Sheist nothin' nice, new to the game
Get your money homie, bitch what's my name?

[Verse: AMG]
Hey-hey! we gon' hit these niggas where it hurt (uh)
Put the worm in your mouth like a perch (uh)
When I'm cum boo you gon' need a cert
Bust one, jump in the Monte Carlo and skirt (skirt!)
Give em naps, give 'em dap, then I holla holla back
"Hey nigga where you goin'?"
Boo I'm checkin' my traps
Yall niggas done shitted and stepped back in it
I'll fuck a nigga up all I need is five minutes

[Verse: Swift]
Swift, and I pimp hoes like it's a gift
I got game so you know I'm "The Answer" like Allen I
Got your whole style shook like 'Quilles or Kobe Bry'
While money multiply you haters ask why
No you can't stop the pimpin' the pimpin' is too fly
Runnin' game on yo wife while you out flossin' your ride
But she said, "if you ain't busy, or close in the vicinity
Stop on by and come get the thighs."

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
[Vocoder Box:]It's John Doe
[DJ Quik:] 4-5's spittin' up outta the
[Vocoder Box:]Four Door
[DJ Quik:] No return fire cause they
[Vocoder Box:]Too slow {*gunshots*}
[DJ Quik:] What's the dilly?
[Vocoder Box:] Cause we kill for a living
[DJ Quik:] And we hungry nigga

You already know who it is… Shade Sheist (Sheist.. Sheist..)
Yea Yea Yea (yea yea yea) Sovizzle (Sovizzle)

[Verse 1: Shade Sheist]
Yes.. Babygirl it's my decision to embark upon this mission
Have me parking in the garage
Using the door that's by the kitchen, I'm itchin
For your love, prolly shouldn't mention
The dimensions of the rock inside my sock is several inches
Played for a few teams and I rode a couple benches
Wrote off a couple bitches, dedicated to my Mrs.,
Swearin under oath and bout to seal it with a kiss
You ain’t never met a nigga like this

[Hook: Latoya Williams]
Like what you do to me
(Like what you do to me)
Treat me just like a queen
(Treat me just like a queen)
Yes you do, Yes you do Baby

[Bridge: Latoya Williams]
No need to tell you baby
You are the one for me
Not sure if sent from Heaven
But Adam I'm your Eve
I’ll make it easy to stay
Can't let your love get away
Cause baby you’re all that I need!

[Hook: Latoya Williams]

[Verse 2: Shade Sheist]
And I ain't tryina come off like I’m sympin
But I damn sure don’t wanna make you think your man is pimpin
For instance, the only time I'm limp is when you put it on me
Fingers to my lower tummy, prolly should've never told me
I mean you, about my spot, cause your lick is like a shot
When you do it makes me hot, better stop
Before we get engaged and I don’t mean marriage
But we bumpin just like bunnies might as well give you some karats
To inherit, my last name and all of my possessions
Girl I'll treat you like a weapon
Keep you tucked next to my chest
Then do you like a test and be the answers to your questions
Cheat up off my paper and you'll never have to guess then
Yep a smart-alec, bout to go turn in my ballot
Bout to scratch my whole arm up because you are my habit
One I don’t need to quit, I don’t need to intervent
I don’t need to slow it down all I need's another hit
Of your love

[Hook: Latoya Williams][Knoc-turn'al]
Super ugly!

[Xzibit]
Mr X to tha Z

[Knoc-turn'al]
Yeah, Warren (aaahaaa aaaahaaa)
LA indo
Gangster and mack mo
Bullets at your window (dangerous)

[Xzibit]
Ruthless, hostile, unforgiven
Who gave you permission to try to stop me from livin huh?
Try again faggot
You've gotta ride better than that
To move out in front of the pack
It's two thousand and two
My backpack raps got my backpack strapped and filled with plaques
I ain't relaxed or laid back at home with my feet up
I drop Pradda, lock and load, heat the streets up
You weak fuck
Shakin and dancing
Ya'll takin pills, we takin penitentiary chances
I'm too advanced-is
Never the same when I hit it and quit it
You want it come get it, I'm wit it
When I say that I'm wit it
That means I got a main defense team that's gon get me acquitted
G's is walkin out the courtroom like George Jefferson
Stop the interviewin, the faggot had it comin to him

[Knoc-turn'al]
Warren G!

[Warren G]
What ya'll thought, I wasn't gonna return with a hit
Too much smokin that Sherman shit
I learnt this from the best that got ya'll sprung (what)
The-the doctor Andre Young
Compton, LB, ain't nothing y'all can tell me
Goin hard on the yard till my dogs bail me
They tells me I can't proceed wit it
I came back and got Warren G wit it

[Nate Dogg]
West coast
Still smoking on that indo
Smoke, oh no don't pretend oh no
I woulda came but I was dead break, no mo
I'm rollin on some real oh no
Bout to get it, but niggas trip though
Let's go
I'm the realest and they all know
Real dope
You need a filter or you will choke
Indo
That's all a nigga will smoke
Oh no

[Shade Sheist]
Now, niggas better get between their door (door)
I'm shakin all your shit onto the floor
And niggas don't get it
But be careful what you ask for you just might get it
Yo the undisputed middle weight champ runnin like Hopkins
Clap six to ya shins niggas start hoppin (Sheist never stoppin)
In other words, if your click full
Can't press mute and it don't apply now
I'm feelin funny in the tummy and a nigga ain't been eatin for weeks (I'm sick)
I ain't trying to get no better
But rather
Infect the world leavin Vicks in an old sweater

[Knoc-turn'al]
Knoc's landin
Tell me if it ain't me, who got the best plannin (yup)
Who got your ears tuned it and who keeps you listenin
Who gots your undivided attention
Who makes your panties wet girl (what)
Hold up, pause
Which nigga on TV that you see makes you wanna give up the draws
At parties and shows, I mash regardless
Yo hardest flows couldn't stop this bombardment
I clench the vision till there's no room for expansion
All prepared for war it's Knoc's landin
A nightly stalker, in shadows I walk
Mindin my own while haters throw soft
The more I succeed, the more bitches clock
Through my peripheral vision I watch subconsciously
Waitin to introduce you to tragedy see
Knoc's landin

[Nate Dogg]
West coast
Still smoking on that indo
Smoke, oh no don't pretend oh no
I woulda came but I was dead break, no mo
I'm rollin on some real oh no
Bout to get it, but niggas trip though

Real dope
You need a filter or you will choke
Indo
That's all a nigga will smoke

[Verse 2: Nate Dogg]

When I wake up in the morning
When I get up out of my bed
At all times I remain a hustler
At all times I be chasing my bread(Thats right)
Since this one's for my people
I'mma make sure you heard what I said
Daddy say speak loud and clearly
Daddy say aim for the head(Nate Dogg!)
I think we all to cool to lose it
I say we all stay leveled instead(Damizza!)
I say still we tame the hookers
I know we still eluding them feds
We made this one for the negroes, and for the caucasians who care
They say they treat us like we equal
I say they treat us like we just don't care

[Hook]

When I wake up in the morning
When I get up out my bed(uh, you got to get on up)
I will always be a hustler
I will always chase my bread
Since this one's for my people(for my people)
I'mma make sure you hear what I said
I'm gon' speak so loud and clearly
I'm gon' aim straight for yo head(bow...bow)

[Verse 3: Shade Sheist]

Yo, I wake up late but still got currency..dreams
Snooze button? No I'm trying to sleep(yeah)
I got bills and the ends ain't trying to meet
So I'm........pressed for cash(what-wha-what)
And I'm out of my league
Ya' see, times ain't the greatest and I ain't Ali
So my hours are 9 to 5 and my job's the street(ha-ha)
I'm in a..........low position trying to hope these mission
Crenshaw(back up off him)
When exposition feeling holiday wishin'
And the block.......West Ave and the spot.......we sure have(yeah)
Rallies on Manchester, Inglewood on Saturdays...(yeah)...turn to night
Shade always been the type to show love to those whom always doin' right(yeah)

[Hook]

When I wake up in the morning(wake up, wake up)
When I get up out my bed
I will always be a hustler
I will always chase my bread(money money, money money)
Since this one's for my people(for my people)
I'mma make sure you hear what I said(yeah keep going, yeah)
I'm gon' speak so loud and clearly(uh-huh)
I'm gon' aim straight for yo head(bow...bow)

[Verse 4: Shade Sheist]

Yo, it don't matter where you from
Not knowing not where you been
Can't go to sleep a child expect to wake a man
Yo, life is a lesson niggas who don't study
End up failing test and blame it on me(what)
But see Sheist only gets what he claiming to be
A real quiet motherfucker with his heart in the streets
Hot in these beats, flow sell a lot in a week
So even Billboard couldn't drop my highest of peaks
I'm with the breaks so you knowin' what they saying to me
I'm impressed how many people end up hating on me
Like a disease Shade hittin' wit' a new vaccine
I leave em' comatose(hah) falling asleep(boo....crossovers)

[Hook]

When I wake up in the morning(yeah)
When I get up out my bed
I will always be a hustler(yeah, money money, money money)
I will always chase my bread
Since this one's for my people(for my people)
I'mma make sure you hear what I said(yeah)
I'm gon' speak so loud and clearly(get that)
I'm gon' aim straight for yo head(bow....bow)

[Nate Dogg]
What would you do
Had another love
What would you say
Had another love
What would you do
Had another love
What would you say
Had another love

[Verse 1: Damizza]
Simplistic ol' pimp shit to rub off your lipstick
Industry misfit
Rich and can spit shit
I'm kickin' my game, without sayin' a name
Could fuck off the fame, but they ain't love the game (So scared)
You like heaven sweet
Can sense you're in heat
I can tell by the way your ass twist in my seat
Cutest fuckin' feet, don't fuck 'em up on the street
Cause I gotta let ya go
If ya, trippin', yo (Go)

[Chorus 2X: Nate Dogg]
What would you do
If I told you I
Had another love
What would you say
If I told you I
Had another love

[Bridge: Nate Dogg]
When I look in your eyes
When you walk right by
When you holdin' my hand
You don't feel like my woman
So I'm saying "Bye, bye"
No more living this lie
I know that wasn't our plan
I guess here we go again

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Shade Shiest]
Shade makin' rounds, and them baby found out
My love with this chick got me dippin' downtown
5-5 and that ass that can do them twleve rounds
Make a nigga put it down, will be fucking to the sound
Make her hit a reach, she got me spittin' out in dro
And when it comes, to blow, she kicks in the door
Got her man's back, and only knows my dough
With this dough and the show
You'se is my ho
Ho

[Chorus] - 2X

[Mariah Carey]
If we got
Together again
I would be your very best friend
Yes I would
I would
I would be by your side
Every day, every night
Chill, baby[Verse 1]
Alright straight up off the top
I'm a hustlah from the block, pullin up in every drop
Inglewood ain't just the spot, it's my city Homie
Centinella till I flop - vehicle ain't got brakes so nxgga we don't stop
I know you couldn't wait to get this back in yo box
Anything that comes from Shade guaranteed it's gon' pop
Now sound them strings - hit a corner with a gangsta lean
We come from Cali and they know just what the fuck that means
Palm Trees, Bomb Bitches where we puff that green
We don't puff that brown, that ain't how it go down
You come around with that shit and yo you might get clowned
I throw up dubs in the city where I rep my town
See me on the Strip - on the Shaw with a Grip
See me in my backyard it might be with a Pit
See me with these nxggaz you ain't neva gotta trip
Cause we still Money Owners on my Timbaland shxt

[Hook]
Yall muthafkaz know my name yea you see me ridin in my Lane
[In that Truck or a Benz..]
All I know is that I handle my Biz..
And y-y-you Already Know Who It Iz
Yall muthafkaz know my name and you damn sure know my game
[I might influence ya Kids..]
I taught ya Daughter how to get this dick..
And now she already Know Wut It Iz

[Verse 2]
Now flip the tip up off the whip and let it beam on Her
She ridin with a nxgga blowin up like C-4
She ain't the type to let a muthafka lean on her
She seein money everyday and she gon' see more
That's my type.. yo that's what I like
If i was a symp nxgga then that's what i'd wife
Kill it kill it, suicide, cut like a knife
To two wristveins plump and lookin ready to slice
Ah.. now that's gruesome.. but i'll do similar to ya
Education.. i'll school ya..
And I'm gifted..
Now BabyGirl you actin hard and heavy but guarantee you that i'll lift it
She-like-my-confidence, luv the arrogance
She-like-me-cause-i'm-big, luv to stare at this
She show up to my house she ain't wearing shit
Now we on my dresser and we tearin to this.. and uh..

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I remember 16s on the whip.. 16s on the whip
Bumpin Regulators hearin Nate 16 in the clip.. 16 in the clip
They call me Luverboy yea I got 16s for a Bitch.. 16s for a bitch
If it's 20 on the finger then u know it's 16 on the wrist.. 16 on the wrist
And that's a helluva number.. i bring heat - helluva summer
When i went away.. i know.. helluva bummer
That was the year before we voted Obama
And now we doin it again baby word to ya momma
That's word to ya old man.. I'm taking this whole land
If Life is a Bitch well I ain't holdin this ho's hand..
Walk her down the aisle? i ain't giving her no chance
To plan a ceremony where at the end we gon' slow dance

[Hook]
