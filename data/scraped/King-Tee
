[MC Ren]
Yeah nigga, MC Ren up in this motherfucker
(West West y'all)
Yeah, L.A. niggas
L.A. niggas rule the world nigga
Y'all niggas gotta recognize, yaknahmsayin?
Niggas don't wanna peep game, yaknahmsayin?
But this shit come all the way back around here
My nigga Dre, droppin' heat box on y'all bitch-ass
Yaknahmsayin? You gotta recognize
L.A. niggas, connected all over the motherfucking world, nigga
Recognize this; peep game

[Time Bomb]
Now in my younger days I used to sport a rag
Backpack full of cans plus a four-four mag
G'd up from the feet up
Blue'd up from the shoe up's how I grew up
Loc'n, smokin' and drinkin' til we threw up (threw up)
At Leimert Park, taggin', hittin' fools up
Ditching my class, just to fuck yo' school up
You don't wanna blast, nigga tuck yo' tool up
But don't sleep, y'all niggas quick to shoot you
Now there's another motherfucker with no future
But Time Bomb much smoother when I maneuver, dope like Cuba
Got em jumpin Disciples to the Hoover

[King T]
I'm coming "Straight Outta Compton" with a loose cannon
Smoke big green, call it Bruce Banner
Watch your manners, at last another blast from the top notch
From way back with the pop rocks, I pop lock witcha
Picture this, Dr. Dre twisting wit Tha Liks
And Hittman bought a fix
Don't trip, it's a Time Bomb in this bitch
Here it tick tick tick tick {*BOOM*}
Wait a minute it's on, I tell it like a true mackadelic
Weed and cocaine sold separate, check it
From sundown to sunup -- clown and run up
The Aftermath'll be two in your gut, nigga what?

Chorus: Knoc-Turn'al, Kokane

We roll deep, smoke on weed drink and pack heat
Requirements for survival each day -- in L.A.!
It don't stop, we still mash in hot pursuit from the cops
Analyze why we act this way -- in L.A.!

[Hittman]
Gimme that mic fool, it's a West coast jack move
They call me Hitt - cause I spit like gats do
Cock me back
Bust caps for my Macz Crew, at Fairfax
Who used to wear Air Max shoes, that's true
But I grew up where niggas jack you, harass you
Blast you, for that set you claim (where you from?)
Mash on you for your Turkish chain, C.K. B.K
Blue'd up or flame, I ran wit a gang
I helped niggas get, jacked for they Dana Dane's
My pants hang below my waistline
I look humble wanna rumble? (yeah yeah)
I bang though, like Vince Carter from the baseline
Don't waste my time
Fuck a scrap in killa Cali, AK's and 9's
One-time's, sun-shines, and fine-ass bitches
Hawaiian Thai, drive-bys, six-fo's on switches

[Xzibit]
I was raised in the hood called WHAT-THE-DIF'
Where the brothers in the hood, refused to go Hollywood
Slugs for the fuck of it
Anybody hatin' on us can suck a dick
If I catch you touching mine you catch a flat-line, dead on the floor
Better than yours, driving away gettin' head from a whore
It's AvireX-to-the-Z
Fuckin' with me might get you banned from TV
Cassette and CD it's all mine the whole nine the right time
Multiply, we don't die, the streets don't lie
What, so neither do I, I'm bad for your health
Like puttin' a pistol up to your face and blastin' yourself

[Defari]
Five in the mornin', burglars at my do'
Glock forty-five in my dresser drawer
Let 'em come in BLAOW he see the thunder roll
Roll with niggas, who buy fifths by the fo'
And brew's by the case
SLAP YOU in the face with the bass, Dr. Dre laced
Likwit Kings wit Sedans and gold rings
Haters fold the style, but can't find no openings

Chorus

[Outro]
In L.A

That's how we ride (4X)[Verse 1: Daveed Diggs]
Set's up high, bitches and whips topless
No ceilings, they pitchin' that Helen Mirren
It's summer, that pot stick (pot stick)
Block burning, G's banging on the beach
White tees, no socks shit
Palm tree on lean, bass rocks with the knock
Every cockpit bumpin' that Pac on the stock system
Rattlin' but battle ready cause all got the heavy metal
Taught to haggle for the fed he watchin'
Watch it, everyone observe the color of the block where they walkin'
Watch how they walkin', see her at the payphone code talkin'
She got them eyes, shorts, thighs thick, pussy poppin'
So the lay of the block maintain as long everybody play they role, if not
Try to step on somebody else's line, but when they do
The critic quick to put a clip in a nine
A motherfucker will die in the summertime

[Hook]
Low nose clown on they pogo bounce when they slow-mo round
Make the hoes go down, homies smoke that loud 'til they choke fall out
And they run they mouth, what they don't know might end 'em
Cause them women so fine in the summertime
Turn a six to a dime in the summertime
Motherfuckers still die in the summertime
It happens all the time in the summertime

[Verse 2: King Tee]
Hold the liquor, it's an avalanche comin'
A Cali nigga flooded in ice and quite stunnin'
And who wouldn't believe the West Coast brung 'em
When the rest start runnin' when my set start gunnin'
I came to represent for the Liquid Empire
The Lexus squire with about six friars
It's been a minute since I lit a nigga on fire
And I won't stop rockin' 'til ya nigga expire
I-a gut the mic with the negative hype
Any steelo will fashion, I'm a negative type
Write whatever you like, starts day into night
Paragraphin' how you have it, I be crashin' your sight
As a treat, I'll eat all beef and gripes
Toss up you niggas tryin' to peel my stripes
Killas don't fright but hold up, here's the truth
Summer turn cold when the crown hits the booth, nigga

[Hook]
Low nose clown on they pogo bounce when they slow-mo round
Make the hoes go down, homies smoke that loud 'til they choke fall out
And they run they mouth, what they don't know might end 'em
Cause them women so fine in the summertime
Turn a six to a dime in the summertime
Motherfuckers still die in the summertime
It happens all the time in the summertime

[Verse 3: Daveed Diggs]
Dice game, rice rocket, pipe laying, sidewalkin'
Eyes, drankin' wine, talkin' (?) (Right?)
Price payin', eye sockets, dry makin', fire lockin'
Fly paper skyrockets, scare residentials
Donuts in the cul-de-sac, photos at the intersection
Show 'em that Corona's back, flipping off the pigs and
Breaking mirrors cause he own it jack
And he on about half a pill and he don't wanna yack
So he keep it rollin' like that dice game
Homies talk shit, Andrew Dice Clay
Homies take shifts watching vice playing nice like they ain't narcs
Roll a seven, guns spark, dogs bark, dial nine-eleven
Cars parked ring alarms, homies stop bettin' just for a second
Then started up again like resurrection, then count their blessings
Stop rubberneckin', you lookin' sweeter than confection, pause
Laugh it off or get a weapon

[Hook]
Low nose clown on they pogo bounce when they slow-mo round
Make the hoes go down, homies smoke that loud 'til they choke fall out
And they run they mouth, what they don't know might end 'em
Cause them women so fine in the summertime
Turn a six to a dime in the summertime
Motherfuckers still die in the summertime
It happens all the time in the summertime[Intro: King Tee]
King Tee's drunk again...Yo, check this out: awww shit, aw shit, I
Wanna dedicate this song to all them motherfuckers out there that-that-that-
That-that-that-that (not again) perpentratin'...perpetratin'... perpin'
Tratin'. Wait, rewind. (eh but yo...King Tee, man, what is this? What is
This?)

[Verse 1: King Tee]
Some cool shit for the King's anthology
And when I'm done, don't expect no apology
Stupid motherfuckers shoulda stepped when I warned 'em
I'm from the Boondocks of Compton, California
I'm just anxious to whoop some ass
I went to high school, but I flunked every class
So what makes you think I give a fuck about respect?
I'll put your bitch in check, and I'll bet
You won't run up, son of a punk and a bitch, too
I shoulda did a drive by on you and your crew
Cuz ya'll be poppin' some shit that's unheard of
For you, what's the word? Uh...(wack!)...it's murder, son
When I be crushin' your hood with a passion
And I ain't talkin' that Action Jackson
When I come you better run for ammo
Or get played like a fuckin' piano...

And yo, we got my homeboy Ice Cube in the house from the motherfuckin'
Lench Mob ('Sup, nigga?), and yo Ice Cube, I heard you're a singer now
Man what's up? Yo, yo...

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
Do-Ray-Me. But I don't sing, mothafucker
I kick shit with the King, mothafucker
Ice Cube will clock the cash, rock the mass
And if you run up, I'll sock your ass
And watch that eye get swollen
Cuz I'm playin' punk niggas like Beethoven
So bust a cap or swing and die
Fuck Yul Brynner, it's still The King and I
Cuz where I'm from the sun don't shine
So One-Time hope I only bust one rhyme
But I bust one more for the suckers
Last year I was Ruthless, now I'm Lenchin' mothafuckers
And you'll see in a tree, MCs and crews
Now they're lookin' for me, King Tee, and Pooh
Now every nigga that crossed me's soprano
Cuz I played their ass like a fuckin' piano...

[King Tee] Yo, check this out, we got my homeboy Breeze in the
Motherfuckin' house from the L.A. Posse, and he got some shit to holler. Come
On, man, bust this shit

[Verse 3: MC Breeze]
Well, I'm-a take the mic like it was a jack move
Run with the beat as long as the track moves
Hot as lava, organized like a seminar
Serve you, your crew, him, and them and a
Couple of rap-saps who think they can get butt
You slipped and shit, so nitwit, just get the nuts
Stealin' your high hopes, watchin' you write notes
Better walk a chalk line, not fuckin' a tightrope
Rap slicker, thicker, quicker than others, then I stop swift
Shift from 1st to 5th, while you stop to shoplift
Take the mic stand whenever the duty calls
If I bust a nut for every rhyme I had, I'd get blue balls
Serious as drama, I'm-a watch her say "Me too."
You're shorter than Michu, your rhymes are see-through
You're nothin' like GQ, transparent, I made it apparent
I'm here to wax and tax the incoherent
Cuz B-R-E-E-Z-E will eas-i-ly re-main to be-e a top MC
When you see me, I wear a beanie, and not a Kangol
Now you got played, like a fuckin' piano

[Verse 4: King Tee]
This is just a sample of three black nig-roes
Who grew up in the heart of the ghetto
Doin' what we had to just to make ends meet
Some steal for a livin', some stand on the street
Just slang. Some gang-bang, but big deal
They say in Compton, you gotta kill or get killed
Mothafuckin' police pull ya over, slam ya down
Then tell ya that your hood is their town
And I ain't goin' for no shit like that;
Cuff me up, take me to jail, I'll come back
Talkin' much shit, cuz I talk what the fuck I feel
A few weeks in the county ain't no big deal
So a punk like you can't fuck with me
That big ballin'-ass nigga named King Tee
You think ya can? I don't think that you can, though
Peace to Ice Cube and Breeze, and the fuckin' piano[Ice Cube]
Here's another day at the stoplight
I'm lookin in my mirror so I can see who can see me
South Central is puttin Ice Cube to the test
With four brothers in the SS
I can't go around and can't back up
So I gotta peep game layin' in the cut
Is this a jack or a kidnap?
Since I'm never ever slippin', I'm fully strapped
I grab my gat out the glove
Do these fools got a problem with me?
Or do they got love?
So when the light turns green, I don't bone out
I wanna see what these black men are all about
Cuz if it's my time, I'm just short
If not, I'm pluggin they Super Sport
First they get behind my ride...
Then they switch lanes to the left side
I'm scopin out the one smokin' indo
Comin' up fast, rollin' down his window
He threw up a sign, I put away my nine
Fool, cuz I'm color blind

[Threat]
Killa Cali, the state where they kill
Over colors cuz brothas don't know the deal
And they'll cap you, not if they have to
But if they want to, first they might confront you
But every nigga on my block can't stop
And he won't stop and he don't stop
Not to the bang bang boogie, but they like to gangbang
And rookies ain't the only ones that drop
Some say the little locs are gettin a little too loc'ed
And when it comes to dust, they kick up the most
Say the wrong word
Then whistle down the street to your homies like a bird
Bust a u-turn, come back and get served nigga
For the women, it don't matter how loud they blouse get
But men, the wrong color outfit, could get your mouth split
It's a shame, but it ain't no thang to me
Cuz I slang these thangs like a G
It's on, is anybody killin' for the summertime
I gotta get another nine, even though I'm colorblind

[KAM]
I'm fresh outta county on bail
And no sooner do I get out, seems like I'm right back in jail
For some gang related activity
Cuz everyday, different fools try to get with me
For no more than a color, or territory
Can't rehabilitate 'em, that's the sheriff's story
So what's left, the judge goes deaf
When you try to tell your side
And you ain't blue eyed
Boy you better duck cuz the book is comin'
And just hand your car keys over to your woman
Because it ain't no sunshine where you headed
And the shit'll drive you crazy if you let it
But now, I got time to think
Because they hit me with everything but the kitchen sink
And I ain't even shed a tear
Cuz believe it or not, they got more love for me here
Now picture that, but on a black and white photograph
Cuz brothas, you don't know the half
On the streets I was damn near outta my mind
But ever since I've been down
I'm colorblind

[WC]
Now here's the game plan, yo, at a quarter to nine
I was told to peel a cap on the other side
Yo, Young and dumb and full of cum, I’m a baby loc
I gotta put in work for the hood and that ain't no joke

[Coolio]
Stable and able but I'm not ready and willin'
Cuz I'm only 13 and I ain't never did a killin'
Grabbed the A.K. and jumped in the G ride
Started up the bucket and headed for the other side

[WC]
Yo, spotted the enemies, now I'm on a creep tip
Hit the 5 dollar stick and I put in my clip

[Coolio]
So, I jumped out the car and no matter what the cost
I had my mind set on sendin niggas to Harrison Ross

[WC]
Caught one from the back and I looked in eyes
Thinkin' should I peel his cap, or should I let him survive
Yo, I'm trapped in the plan designed by another side

[Coolio]
I ain't contributin to genocide (why?)
Cause I'm colorblind

[King Tee]
Niggas in the hood ain't changed
And I've finally figure out that we're not in the same gang
Cuz, I walk the alleys of Compton with nowhere to turn
Every which way I get burned.
Baby Lou wears blue, Big Fred wears red
Put 'em together and we color 'em dead
Dead, dyin, gettin smoked's like part of the fun
They get smoked just to show how many come to the funeral

[J-Dee (Lench Mob)]
I understand how all my homeboys feel
Cuz I been shot; to this day, I pack my steel
Cuz I was born in a certain territory
Where you don't talk only the streets tell stories
With blue and red bandanas on the street
And if you slippin, you'll be six feet deep
Cuz me and T-bone, we pay it no mind
And for the rest of the mob, we stay color blind[Intro: Xzibit]
Ay, what the fuck man? (*laughter*)
See, look, look, uhh

[Verse One: Xzibit]
I grab the mic and start breakin down niggas without no problems
Broadcastin live from the bottom
Ain't no mic checkin worse, kick some rhymes if you got them
But if it's whack, I draw back the cap for the peelin
Shoulda stuck to rock dealin
Cause it's the blood stealin, super villain
Chillin, stayin high like the ceilin
See there ain't enough room for the both of us
See it's a showdown, throw down, your best style I'll bust (yo)
I write rhymes that make niggas throw they sets up
Couldn't hold my style if you had a pair of handcuffs
In all disrespect
I'll snatch you by your neck and do a suplex and step
So nigga you can check my credentials
Just hard rhymes and instrumentals
Xzibit smash you wit a dental and a loaded pistol
No longer lookin in the window
I'll bust a field wit indo
Killin quarts of beer, Sadie's outta here...

[Verse Two: MC Breeze]
Like a fuse, start spreadin the news
It's ninety-four and Breeze is givin niggas the blues
I paid my dues, and now it's time to go on to the next mode
Make room for the kaboom, cause I'm about to explode
And drop bombs like a B1, cops I seize none
And niggas step up, I soak emcees son
Three seconds to detonate, you betta evacuate
No time to hesitate, you fuckin featherweight
I ain't the type to pick up the mic and catch the stage fright
I'll pull a gauge if I ain't paid right
To the promoters on tour
Short me a buck and a buckshot and the barrel is yours!
I'm psychopathic like Manson, ain't wit the dancin
But still I get more Cheers than Ted Danson
More dough than Marino or roles than Pacino
You beatin me? Yhat's only in your dreams ho
I'm not sayin I'm unbeatable, I'm sayin I'm untouchable
Livin comfortable just like a Huxtable
Plus I'm rollin with the crossroads
Move in fast foward, while you other suckers stuck in a pause mode
I goes deep like a great white, but I'mma stay black
No matter how high the pay stacks, or if my rep gets bigger
You might get take this nigga out the ghetto, but not the ghetto out this nigga

[Verse Three: J-Ro, Tash]
For the balls, basketballs, microphones gas and grass (hey)
Some of the few things J-Ro likes to pass
93 mandingo, 94 I'm the pharaoh
Cause I'm b-b-bad to the bone marrow
I get wild, with more styles than the martial arts
I need weed, I roll more grass than golf carts
April ninety-two you know the Ro was a looter
Now I'm writin raps on my laptop computer
J-Ro the tittie fiend, rap dean, wearin green
Been on the scene, since the age of thirteen
I learned I had to earn the mic, now's my turn
I got Furious Styles like Larry Fishburne

With the bitches tunin me in like it's the Young and the Restless
Next up to bust my shit from the L-I-K-S's
Yes it's the freshest with lyrics rough around the edges
I'll smoke you on the mic like a pack of Benson Hedges
But.. hold up wait, I'll bust rhymes that'll circulate
That'll "Wake yo' punk ass up" like MC Eiht
Cause I been rockin rhymes since the roof was on fire
So point me to the bitch who's the dopest butterfly'er
I'll make her break it down like she Patra when I catch ya
Broadway is on the tables while I throw these lyrica at'cha
So.. slow down before ya fuck wit my sound
You better do the hokey pokey and turn yourself around

[Verse Four: King Tee]
Now me watch get Doggy like Snoop, funky from my group
Make them wanna shoot, there it is whoop
Fool, I got props, bustin at the cops
Gettin what I got, blowin up the spots
Checkin out the scene, somethin like a dream
How I become a king, stuffin all the green
Coolest of the cool, a God damn fool
Breakin up the rule, I'm from the old school
So hey, busters speak, no wait busters preach
Signed by the each, trickin for the treat
Known to be the boss, tipsy off the sauce
Drunk off the funk cause Tha Alkaholiks floss
The real situation, so peep what you facin
The Zulu Nation on your Nubian station
Ready for the war, walk without a girl
I'm livin cherry mood with the diamonds and pearls...

You know what I'm sayin
Some of that old black shit, you know what I'm sayin
Comin from the West coast side, you know what I'm sayin
That crazy shit
Back off with that all other bullshit, what's up Jermaine
My man Breeze is in the motherfuckin house tonight you know what I'm sayin
My man Xzibit, yeah, Tha Alkaholik straight pumpin shit straight at you
From the signifyin Crew you know what I'm sayin
Day-alight, yeah, yeah, yeah
Check it out y'all? comin down tonight, broad way
Jamboree, this shit is straight pumpin, word up
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me
Let me do a motherfuckin back up[Verse 1: Xzibit, King-T & Tha Alkaholics]
Never has it been so bright
Gotta tell bitches, get outta my sight
Bitch, you blocking my light
I'm in Vegas front seat at the fight
I'm a alcoholic so you know I'm getting it right
Louis the 13th
Hennessy Black when I'm thirsty
I like my liquor dark milk chocolate Hershey
But first we
Gotta bang loose for the niggas that's been waiting on it
Patiently debating, even hating on it, bitch
I started this gangsta shit
House shoes and the shotgun, check the pinks)
The hangover is over, Tila created the lynx
(So tell the whole world to suck my dick, real shit
The addiction that you can't deny
Twelve steps to recovery, or else you die)
Yeah, this is for you and I
Fly, pelican, fly
Fuck trying to get by
Or we can put that bullshit to the side and kill 'em
L-B Cool S
Put a (?) out in Sweden out in (?)
So what makes a motherfucker so damn fresh?
We on the coast, yeah, you know to the left
Louie the 13th
Back down original, pack-town originator
I'm full of 40's like the g-thang refrigiator
Getting paper with my neighbor like that Clippers and the Lakers
Drinking Jack next to Jack, courtside at the Staples
Affiliation is vital for survival, we rolling
The caravan pulling up with a million trucks
(And I'm feeling like a million bucks
A all-star nigga still in Chucks
Louis the 13th
You can say what you say, just spell (?) right
Still got a lot of Louie's leftover from last night
We alcoholic minded, DJ rewind it
Bitches and liquor, we only fuck with the finest
King-T your highness
I'm timeless, y'all niggas is spineless
Drinking everything on the wine list
So yeah, nigga, come and catch this fade
Or break bread and we can all get paid
Louis the 13th
I got 14 courts, all sorts of imports
Premium spirits, mixed with marked lyrics
Don't fuck with Xzibit, I will crush your frame
Say my name, I will hunt you like Saddam Hussein
I'm crown royal
Coming out the comptown soil
Niggas in the kingdom stay loyal
It's the old English, linguist, distinguished genius
Always got a cup in my hand
Louis the 13th
Lets have a conversation bout my present situation
I don't need to be a star, I got my own constellation
Professional inebriation, we having a celebration
A live nation and heavy rotation
Patience
Hold more information than a free mason
It's a secret society, never try sobriety
SS Bugatti, live with the Illuminati
(?) picking up the bodies
We crash the party
(?) and Harley's mixed with Bacardi
Man, fuck everybody[MC Ren]
Yeah nigga, MC Ren up in this motherfucker
(West West y'all)
Yeah, L.A. niggas
L.A. niggas rule the world nigga
Y'all niggas gotta recognize, yaknahmsayin?
Niggas don't wanna peep game, yaknahmsayin?
But this shit come all the way back around here
My nigga Dre, droppin heat box on y'all bitch-ass
Yaknahmsayin? You gotta recognize
L.A. niggas, connected all over the motherfuckin world, nigga
Recognize this

[Time Bomb]
Now in my younger days I used to sport a rag
Backpack full of cans plus a four-four mag
G'd from the feet up
Blued up from the sewer's how I grew up
Loc'n, smokin and drinkin til we threw up (threw up)
At Leimert Park, taggin, hittin fools up
Ditchin my class, just to fuck yo' school up
You don't wanna blast, nigga tuck yo' tool up
But don't sleep, y'all niggas quick to shoot you
Now there's another motherfucker with no future
But Time Bomb much smoother when I manuever, dope like Cuba
Got em jumpin {*King T starts speakin, indecipherable*}

[King T]
I'm comin "Straight Outta Compton" with a loose cannon
Smoke big green, call it Bruce Banner
Watch your manners, at last another blast from the top notch
From way back with the pop rocks, I pop lock witcha
Picture this, Dr. Dre twistin wit Tha Liks
And Hittman bought a fix
Don't trip, it's a Time Bomb in this bitch
Here it tick tick tick tick {*BOOM*}
Wait a minute it's on, I tell it like a true mackadelic
Weed and cocaine sold seperate, check it
From sundown to sunup -- clown done run up
The Aftermath'll be two in your gut, nigga what?

Chorus: Knoc-Turn'al, Kokane

We roll deep, smoke on weed drink and pack heat
Requirements for survival each day -- in L.A.!
It don't stop, we still mash in hot pursuit from the cops
Analyze why we act this way -- in L.A.!

[Hittman]
Gimme that mic fool, it's a West coast jack move
They call me Hitt - cause I spit like gats do
Cock me back
Bust caps for my max crew, at Fairfax
Who used to wear Air Max shoes, that's true
But I grew up where niggas jack you, harass you
Blast you, for that set you claim (where you from?)
Mash on you for your turkish chain, C.K. B.K
Blued up or flame, I ran wit a gang
I helped niggas get, jacked for they Dana Dane's
My pants hang below my waistline
I look humble wanna rumble? (yeah yeah)
I bang though, like Vince Carter from the baseline
Don't waste my time
Fuck a scrap in killa Cali, AK's and 9's
One-time's, sunshines, and fine-ass bitches
Hawaiian thai, drive-by, six-fo's on switches

[Xzibit]
I was raised in the hood called WHAT-THE-DIF'
Where the brothers in the hood, refused to go Hollywood
Slugs for the fuck of it
Anybody hatin on us can suck a dick
If I catch you touchin mine you catch a flatline, dead on the floor
Better than yours, drivin away gettin head from a whore
It's AvireX-to-the-Z
Fuckin with me might get you banned from TV
Cassette and CD it's all mine the whole nine the right time
Multiply, we don't die, the streets don't lie
What, so neither do I, I'm bad for your health
Like puttin a pistol up to your face and blastin yourself

[Defari]
Five in the mornin, burglars at my do'
Glock forty-five in my dresser drawer
Let em come in BLAOW he see the thunder roll
Roll with niggas, who by fifths by the fo'
And bruise by the case
SLAP YOU in the face with the bass, Dr. Dre laced
Likwit Kings wit Sedans and gold rings
Haters fold the style, but can't find no openings

Chorus

[Outro]
In L.A

That's how we ride (4X)[ VERSE 1 ]
It's Friday night on the streets of L.A
I'm goin out, been hangin round the house all day
So i take me a shower, dress like a big daddy
Stop at the Arco, put some gas in my caddy
Armor on my wheels, shine up my daytons
Check my 12-gauge, I see jackers just waitin
Got in my car, rolled up the tinted glass
Looked for my Zapp tape to pop in my dash
Can't find it, forget it, went under my seat
Found my old fired tape of the song "Knee Deep"
So I popped it in, then I pumped it up
Love hearin funk because disco sucks
Body got chills when the basses started poundin
I took off because I'm goin to town, and
Won't be back till mornin, don't have to go to school
(Better get ready) I'm finna act a fool

[ VERSE 2 ]
Now I'm on the move, got a grand in my pocket
Reached for my phone, plugged it in the socket
Heard the dial tone, so I dialed up Aladdin
He answered the phone and said "What's up?" I said "What's happenin"
He said, "Where you been? I been tryin to get in touch
The party's in Watts," I said, "I don't give a fuck"
"If you wanna go, just wear neutral colors
If anybody asks you, just tell em you're my brother"
Stopped at the store to buy me a Cisco
A 40 ounce and some crackers by Nabisco
[Amount] and I pulled out a 10
And said, "Fuck it, Supersacco and gin
I'm finna act a fool"

[ VERSE 3 ]
Now I'm drivin down Compton on my way to get Aladdin
Feelin like a pimp till my tape started draggin
It's a old tape anyway, it ain't no thing
Pulled it out and slapped in Dana Dane
Got to Aladdin's house and I honked my horn
He said, "When we comin back?" I said, "6 n tha morn"
So he got in the car, lookin half-dead
So I gave him my Cisco and took the 40 to the head
Now I'm feelin tipsy, and I'm headed for Watts
But wait, what do I see sittin at the bus stop?
Sexy Susanna, had a butt that kills
Pretty long hair, but they say it's not real
Aladdin yelled (these fake or real?) she threw a rock in my glass
So I got out my car and drop-kicked her ass
I checked out my window, everything was cool
She was lucky I was nice and I didn't act a fool

[ VERSE 4 ]
We finally arrived at the party, drunk as a jerk
Got out my car, pressed the kit so the alarm, would chirp
After that we made our way, I tried not to fall
Couldn't walk a straight line if they let me crawl
Got to the door, and what spots my eye?
My homeboy Mr. Prince, and he's smokin some Thai
So I stumbled his way and said, "Hey, pass the jay"
I took a hit for my mouth spray
This girl asked me to dance, but I told the ho no
Cause she was on my tip cause of my big gold rope
But it seems she got offended - that's splendid
Before she starts somethin, I just slap her and end it
Cause I feel like a gangster, and I just don't care
About a girl with fake drag, fake eyes, fake hair
Fake clothes, fake nails and all that fake jewelry
All she wanna do is tell her friends that she screwed me
I get nutty, act a fool when IIwant to
Run up when I'm drunk and I just might pump you
Take your car, your wife, keep talkin, your life
Beat you down and have you smokin the pipe
(You know why?) cause I'm cool

(Well, kill me!
Shoot me, muthafucka!)
(I gotcha)
(Oh goddamn)Yo nigga, let's go scoop up some of these hoes at the 'Paradise', man
Hey man, ah - I'm engaged now, man
What?
I'm engaged
To that bitch?
Aw man, don't be talkin about my woman like that
Oh, now you're gon' trip on me
Wait, wait, hold up, hold up

[ VERSE 1: King Tee ]
How you gon' go and put a ho before me?
When I'm the one that helped your broke ass on the streets
'Damn, I'm starvin, what you got to eat?
I'm short, I need a place to sleep'
Oh, but amnesia, that damn skeezer
Made you forget who was down witcha
I thought birds of a feather flock together
And don't a damn thing change but the weather
But now I know the real, I guess I had it all wrong
We used to hit the Ides until the shit was all gone
Where was she when you needed niggas off your ass
And who'd you come to get to go blast?
Not that once-a-month-bleedin, always on her knees
Suckin every Tom, Dick and Harry like a berry
I seen her with a trick at the Motel 6
And you still tryin to get that bitch Afro Fix
She got you by the nuts, playin with your wiener
Wrapped around her finger when the last time you seen her
Well, when you do, bust her lip
And if you don't, you'se a bitch
So sit down when you piss, muthafucka

(It's a shame, but it ain't no thang to me) --] Deadly Threat

[ VERSE 2: Deadly Threat ]
The bitch got you gone, talkin on a phone
Tellin muthafuckas when you see me, it's on
But little do he know that she a zero
And I'm still her favorite superhero
See, I got the 411 on a ho
Just like I was tellin you before
You're just a piece of the mission
Guess where her lips been?
I told you don't be kissin, but you don't listen
[ King Tee ]
Yeah, Jaws (Jaws) Jaws the only ho I ever saw
That could suck a basketball through a straw
She don't like niggas with Nissan trucks
Unless they got the monster bumps
[ Deadly Threat]
That's right, honey, bunny's money-hungry
And she'll frame ya, she's out to getcha
Get the picture, cause the bitch'll
Take you for a long-ass ride like the hitcher
So don't be surprised if they find you in a ditch
With your guts hangin out lookin like Top Ramen
And when I see the bitch, I'm bombin
Cause she's a false tenderony, plus tossed balony
And she ain't your home, she's a ho
Don't put a ho before the homie

(Hey yo bitch, you better tell em) --] Ice Cube

[ VERSE 3: Ice Cube ]
Who's wearin the pants, who's wearin the pants, nigga?
If you ask me, I think that her dick is bigger
Than your little dick, and I'm tellin you, Jay
The bitch got you locked down like Pelican's Bay
Now I told you if you fuck with the ho
She's guaranteed to have you trippin
And me and you set-trippin
I told my muthafuckin crew
To kidnap the ho, and they came back with you
[ King Tee ]
I can't fade a nigga that's bitch-made
Kool-Aid pumpin, tell a bitch somethin
She'll have your ass cookin dinner
While she's lettin every nigga in her hood run up in her
[ Ice Cube ]
Got you runnin like Bruce Ginner, and the ho be
Pussy-whippin your ass like Toby
Now you act like you don't know me
Only a mark'll put a ho before the homies

Word - this muthafucka is different
Yeah
Tell me your secret
Not just any secret
Just answer one question for me, baby
Do you love me?
I love you
Very, very, very, very much
Baby
Can I come pick you up and take you shoppin?
Spend all my money...
I love you
I love you

Don't put a ho before the homieVerse One: Tash

Caps get peeled rolling in my force field
Like a nine with hollow points I keep rap flows concealed
So when you walkin down the block you better watch who you approachin
I'm not your R&B singer, so ain't no need for vocal coachin
Just a forty and a roach and I'll evict you out the units
While y'all niggas couldn't move me if you worked for Starvin Students
Downin all beer types, from St. Ide's to Red Stripe (yipes!)
The man that's stuffin mics down motherfuckers windpipes
Has returrrrned, to burrrrn, it's time y'all niggas learrrrrn
I neaturalize y'all niggas like relaxer in a perm
With flows that go against the grain with a story so compellin
I should mind The People's Court, snatch the mic from Doug Llewellyn
And host my own show, after Bill Cosby comes Ricooooo!
Transmitting live to all my black people
Catch my drift, I'm down with my nigga E-Swift
My name is Tash, I'm from the group that you don't wanna fuck with
Never shy, sippin on some why ask why
Smokin thai with this bitch that's more fly than Jasmine Guy
Hooked up with John Q so let me do my thiiing
While niggas rock that played shit that they bought from Chess King
But still, I train rhymes to flip like a seal
Niggas say my rhyme skill on the steel is unreal
But all I do is chill and swing it when I bring it
Oh shit that's my nigga show these niggas how you sing it

Verse Two: Q-Tip

I bring it to your chest pa all the way live
We deliver ill verses guaranteed to cause hives
When we start rappin heads roll like Patton
What the fuck bloodclot the Alkaholiks rhyme a lot
Yo I'm like Grimace when I'm on this rap scrimmage
ANd I got this magic wand to make your puny soul diminish
The Abstract delivers, I be the Queens nigga on point
Mary Jane ain't nuttin but a joint
They called a nigga up to add a little bit of flavor
Now I'm cuttin and slashin like Luke's light saber
Yeah, what? You trapped in the zone
Where MC's get seared and all spots blown
And in this rap shit a nigga need to be thicky
I fuck with the crew who downs the deuce deuce Mickey's
I'm from the rotten apple, y'all niggas can't grapple
And love to the Liks, hit your ass like a tackle

[Pow, bust my liquid-ass style
Peace to Mad Lib and my nigga Wild Child]

Verse Three: J-Ro

Yo put in the disc E
While I hit the whiskey
[Bust a rhyme off the head J]
The nigga missed me
I'm in this rap game so I'mma aim to be best
It's fresh, but off the head it's like the dunk contest
I don't walk the street, I roll my Jeep in an instant
I rock the beat to sleep like an infant
The Likwit crew, comin like this on you
With that four minute Olde English piss on you
You're bustin dumb raps off the cap, oh shit
But I got the pen and pad locked down like a pit
I let the ink submerge into the thin wood sheets
Beats make my head bop, so I'mma rock it for the streets
I fill all my days with big butts and boom
I let my pants hand cause my big nuts need room
I'm not old school, or new school, I'm modern school, I'm ditchin
When my girl starts bitchin I gets hot like a kitchen
I fly down like the Chi-town wind
Cause I got the iller noise to make the hardcore grin
When, the saints come marchin in
I'mma roll right by em in the fly Lincoln
Roughneck niggas wanna box me down
Cause I got the ladies lookin like Foxy Brown
The Liks bring the beer Tip sticks it in your earholes
I drop the mic and strike the Heisman pose

Verse Four: King Tee

Hardcore G, I get hardcore man
From the underland a fuckin wonderman, bam
Lunatic potential, an isperential differential
Confidentially smashin instrumentals
On this tune I bring raps of doom to the mic
And put my rear shit in flight, peep
If the drunk funk don't wanna hump in your trunk
Man you got some motherfuckin junk[Intro: King Tee Talking]
Ha ha, yeah
Stop
My man Herut
We came to put a little trife in your life
Yes Sir, ooohhh, spill a little game
Spit a new game

[Defari Herut]
Understand one thing
Study the game, look at your frame, nothin' remains
One second gone things'll never the same
Livin' with change, we all want a mension and reigns
But can't explain, why homeless have to remain!
Give up on life, yeah right, I struggle and fight
Fight for my life, for sure nigga, fight til I die
For my Hip-Hop, we smoke burnin' the sky
It's reddin' my eye, turn the key startin' my mind
Now they came high, Snakes in the grass tell lies
Babylon rock, Babylon will burn in fire
Burnin' desires, liquor, gushs, Rims and Tires
Higher then high, we blow 'til our lunks expire
Firmin' desires, Hennessey and light green pyres
Higher then high, we blow 'til our lunks expire (*Coughing*)

[Hook]
Some of things gonna blow my mind
Tryin' to figure them now while I'm gettin' high
?? the life shippin'
Champagne, every time I tried
Some of things gonna blow my mind
Got to get some stacks, got to smoke this fry
Steady some stress searchin' that
Turnin, back as the life goes by

[King Tee]
I'm ballin' out control, way before the first tape sold
A nigga stayed ballin, I ain't never went gold
Cuffed by the cops, but a nigga never told
Tila kept chips, somethin' fresh to roll
Niggas need to stop hatin, niggas need to start prayin'
Thinkin' God they ain't facin' what I'm prayin'
Big Time Crooks, with them Mad Dog looks
With the trigger, on you Hollywood ass niggas
Like I said before, I balled half my life
Kept it Gangster for the ones locked down, singin' through the night
And you was just tryin' to make it right
Beat your little ones and your wife
Hold up, I rather slang big crack and big macks any day
Niggas did that to live fat anyway
So you'll take a few grips to your homeboy's bitch
That slut got back then she snitched, damn!

[Hook]

[Defari Herut]
I will, architect the life to build
I won't, sleep cause it's real in a field
I do, pledge allegiance to my crew
I don't, love with a chosen few
I can't, strive to be the best of man
I can't, fear God's master plans
So I know, I only got one life to live

[King Tee]
Yeah, and with that, we live day by day
It's for the moment, focusin' in one opponent
Can't really leave too much rules so upon us
I'm a hard, and punks show up to get dart
Fifteen years on the set and still hard
Still got some old money buried in the yard
Police, straight a head, young nigga don't clinch
He chose to play the game, young nigga don't snitch

[Hook: til fade][Intro: J-Ro]
(Whooo! Hah hah!) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah we kickin' it
Uhh uhh uhh we kickin it
Yeah yeah we kickin it
(Whooo!) Yeah yeah we kickin it
Yeah, Cali in the house
Huh, uhh, Fred in the house
Check it out, BULLSHIT!

[Verse One: J-Ro]
I'm J-Ro the man, I'm gettin down
I gets mo daps than H. Rap Brown
I drive the hoes wild cause they love the way I talk
You can't drive me crazy cause I'm close enough to walk
I bust threes like Terry Tegall, get higher than a eagle
You're just a dirty pigeon, B.S.in' bout religion
I don't give a damn if you don't eat ham
You grab the microphone and refuse to slam
I make a nigga scared to grab the mic behind me
I kick shit so deep King Neptune couldn't fine me
Yo, can I get a go J-Ro?
(Go J-Ro!) To let me know if I can flow
I probably be doper if I smoked crack like you
But Swift and Tash'll beat my ass until I'm black and blue
Cause I ain't with, no way out shit
I'm tired of this one-hittin played out shit

[Hook]
Some niggas rock like the Liks... BULLSHIT!
Uhh, I hate big tits... BULLSHIT!
We'll never make another hit... BULLSHIT!
I don't drink cause I quit... BULLSHIT!

Come on
(Whooo!) Yeah yeah yeah yeah
We kickin' it (hold up) we kickin' it
We kickin' it

[Hook cont.]
Baby youse my one and only... BULLSHIT!
Baby that's a true fact... BULLSHIT!
Uhh, I never leave ya lonely... BULLSHIT!
Yo, I'll call you right back... BULLSHIT!

[Verse Two: J-Ro]
Baby don't take the blame, you's a real cool dame
But now that I made you call my name you just don't look the same
From the middle of the bed I bang your head like a rock 'n' roller
On the way out, I smacked a nigga with my pistol-a
When I met you I said "What's your name?" Tara
You hopped on my dank like there was no tomorrow
All I wanted was some sexin', now you want affection
Damn I hate to see your ass comin' in my direction
Wait here, I'll be right back, I'm goin' to get a spliff
You know I'm gonna juke your ass like Emmitt Smith

[Verse Two cont.: King Tee]
Well oh snap! Here goes a fashion
That's incredible, with the style
That I learned back as a younglin, where's the beef
Don't sleep, I used to run around with the creeps
Ain't no tellin', Jack told Helen
About a lot of people so I'm runnin' for the border
And get me a taco, gin and sako
Mom and pop yo, I'm rockin' this shit!
It's not a plan I wrote the book called style
Taught the child how to stand when he piss
Be a man, go fuck Jan
The white man's tan, bring back MC Shan

[Hook]
And I rhymed every word... BULLSHIT!
Wackest style you ever heard... BULLSHIT!

[Outro]
For the beats sake, rock on rock on
For the beats sake, rock on rock on
And you go Whoooo! Grand groove, grand groove
(Alkaholiks y'all, alkaholiks y'all) Uhh, take it back now
Cause it's fat now, that's how I bring it back now
Whoooo! Grand groove grand groove
This one dedicated, to all the motherfuckers out there
Bullshittin
This wonderful bullshit how would you make a record
BULLSHIT!
I don't smoke no BULLSHIT!
I don't drink no BULLSHIT!
I don't fuck no BULLSHIT!
This one goes out to the P-Town
And all over, yeah baby, yeah baby, Compton baby
Everybody in the house
And we out... Alkaholiks...King Tee:
I'm the man that'll bust dat ass, I'm the man that'll bust dat ass

J-Ro:
Naw, I'm the man that'll bust dat ass, I'm the man that'll bust dat ass
(say what?!)

E-Swift:
Naw nigga, I'm the man that'll bust dat ass, I'm the man that'll bust dat
Ass

Hook:
I'm the man that'll bust dat ass, I'm that man that'll bust dat ass

King Tee talking:
Yo check this out. This is Tha Alkaholik crew. E-Swift didn't they say it
Couldn't be done? They said King Tee couldn't bring out the Alkaholik crew
(but we doin' it). Yo, it's the fresh shit. The dope shit for 1993. Tha
Alkaholik crew. I'm gonna bust out like this, here we go, come on

King Tee:
Now bust it, I'm a try to freak it with the drums
Alkaholik funk, bass for the trunk
And I'm kinda crazy, stupid and hey
I can do the nasty and drink like a sailor
I'm real smooth, free from germs
Even walk away when my homie smokin' sherm
Cause this is how I kick it, hoes got to lick it
It's Tha Alkaholiks and J-Ro is wicked
E-Swifts mad, cause he Got It Bad
King Tees phat and I sport a blue rag
For the little whips and the honey dips
It's gang truece so I put away the clips
Baby baby baby I might flip
Got to get it on, let my backbone slip
If I fall back then give me some gas
If you try to play me I'll bust dat ass

Hook (x4)

J-Ro:
Put the mic down clown, you can't get down
Jump around stage like your name was Charlie Brown
When the kid is played out your rap record is finished
Diminish, you couldn't come strong if you ate a gang of spinach
Popeye, you could never drop by, you can never stop by
Cause you can never top I
I got to hold back now I'm out before your turf
Because I want it all like the nigger Greedy Smurf
It's time to scoop the wack up, E-Swift bring the track up (alright)
Punk you better pack up, cause the unit got my back up
You're a mic stand, got a steady woman
But I been in more sheets than the Klu Klux Klan
I'm the J to the Ro, and I want to make it clear
That you're rappin' like a queer so why don't you get on out of here
With the alley cat coat wearin', Hush Puppy shoe-wearin'
[???] that seen you with (punk you ain't shit!)
King Tee and the Liks blowin' up like gas
I bend your rhyme over, I bend your rhyme over
I bend your rhyme over, I bend your rhyme over
I bend your rhyme over, then I bust dat ass

Hook (x4)

Talking:
Tha Alkaholiks, Tha Alkaholiks, I'm drunk, I'm drunk, Tha Alkaholiks
Straight for 93. Rippin' shit up. Tha Alkaholik , now you join E-Swift

Hook

E-Swift:
I fiend to get busy like a bee, check 1,2,3!
E-Swift and Tha Alkaholik crew with King Tee
Bangin' niggas out the box, drink my scotch on the rocks
And I'm makin' more hits than the motherfuckin' Black Sox
I'm kickin' lines like Tyson kickin' ass
Niggas can't laugh, I put your neck in a cast
Yes, I"m the man with the skills to talk shit
And I'm back by the crew that none of y'all can get with
So back to the lab to fix your demo
Or get played like Sega or Nintendo
Simple as that, give me a beat that's phat
And watch a nigga jump on a motherfucker like cheese and a rat
It's strictly, dirty underground ass funk
That's busting out the weak 15's in your trunk
So don't be scared, be prepared when it hits
The average motherfucker can't hand with the Liks

Hook (x4)[Ice Cube]
Here's another day at the stoplight
I'm lookin in my mirror so I can see who can see me
South Central is puttin Ice Cube to the test
With four brothers in the SS
I can't go around and can't back up
So I gotta peep game layin' in the cut
Is this a jack or a kidnap?
Since I'm never ever slippin', I'm fully strapped
I grab my gat out the glove
Do these fools got a problem with me?
Or do they got love?
So when the light turns green, I don't bone out
I wanna see what these black men are all about
Cuz if it's my time, I'm just short
If not, I'm pluggin they Super Sport
First they get behind my ride...
Then they switch lanes to the left side
I'm scopin out the one smokin' indo
Comin' up fast, rollin' down his window
He threw up a sign, I put away my nine
Fool, cuz I'm color blind

[Threat]
Killa Cali, the state where they kill
Over colors cuz brothas don't know the deal
And they'll cap you, not if they have to
But if they want to, first they might confront you
But every nigga on my block can't stop
And he won't stop and he don't stop
Not to the bang bang boogie, but they like to gangbang
And rookies ain't the only ones that drop
Some say the little locs are gettin a little too loc'ed
And when it comes to dust, they kick up the most
Say the wrong word
Then whistle down the street to your homies like a bird
Bust a u-turn, come back and get served nigga
For the women, it don't matter how loud they blouse get
But men, the wrong color outfit, could get your mouth split
It's a shame, but it ain't no thang to me
Cuz I slang these thangs like a G
It's on, is anybody killin' for the summertime
I gotta get another nine, even though I'm colorblind

[KAM]
I'm fresh outta county on bail
And no sooner do I get out, seems like I'm right back in jail
For some gang related activity
Cuz everyday, different fools try to get with me
For no more than a color, or territory
Can't rehabilitate 'em, that's the sheriff's story
So what's left, the judge goes deaf
When you try to tell your side
And you ain't blue eyed
Boy you better duck cuz the book is comin'
And just hand your car keys over to your woman
Because it ain't no sunshine where you headed
And the shit'll drive you crazy if you let it
But now, I got time to think
Because they hit me with everything but the kitchen sink
And I ain't even shed a tear
Cuz believe it or not, they got more love for me here
Now picture that, but on a black and white photograph
Cuz brothas, you don't know the half
On the streets I was damn near outta my mind
But ever since I've been down
I'm colorblind

[WC]
Now here's the game plan, yo, at a quarter to nine
I was told to peel a cap on the other side
Yo, Young and dumb and full of cum, I’m a baby loc
I gotta put in work for the hood and that ain't no joke

[Coolio]
Stable and able but I'm not ready and willin'
Cuz I'm only 13 and I ain't never did a killin'
Grabbed the A.K. and jumped in the G ride
Started up the bucket and headed for the other side

[WC]
Yo, spotted the enemies, now I'm on a creep tip
Hit the 5 dollar stick and I put in my clip

[Coolio]
So, I jumped out the car and no matter what the cost
I had my mind set on sendin niggas to Harrison Ross

[WC]
Caught one from the back and I looked in eyes
Thinkin' should I peel his cap, or should I let him survive
Yo, I'm trapped in the plan designed by another side

[Coolio]
I ain't contributin to genocide (why?)
Cause I'm colorblind

[King Tee]
Niggas in the hood ain't changed
And I've finally figure out that we're not in the same gang
Cuz, I walk the alleys of Compton with nowhere to turn
Every which way I get burned.
Baby Lou wears blue, Big Fred wears red
Put 'em together and we color 'em dead
Dead, dyin, gettin smoked's like part of the fun
They get smoked just to show how many come to the funeral

[J-Dee (Lench Mob)]
I understand how all my homeboys feel
Cuz I been shot; to this day, I pack my steel
Cuz I was born in a certain territory
Where you don't talk only the streets tell stories
With blue and red bandanas on the street
And if you slippin, you'll be six feet deep
Cuz me and T-bone, we pay it no mind
And for the rest of the mob, we stay color blindArtist: King Tee
Album: IV Life
Song: Let's Go Dippin

Well it's a hot hot Sunday jump up around a quarter to ten
Had to run and get this blunt that I left in my Benz
I lit the shit and caught a early mornin buzz
And called my nigga E 'What up loc?,' 'What up cuz?'
I'm thinkin bout pullin out the trey for performance
And maybe hit a few corners
I let the batteries charge while the kids stood waitin
For me to hit the switch and floss the Daytons
I tap my shit, yo, my shit was hot
So I drove straight to the wash spot
They shine my shit up real glossy
Suckers starin but my shit jumps like Kriss Kross G
So fuck what ya heard cause my trey does flips
The superclean three with the lifts
I guess I got my whole day planned and I'm trippin
Quick to hit the switch so let's go dippin

Let's go dippin, dippin through the streets (repeat 3X)

Now I'm rollin cocked up, flossin down the street
I took Imperial to the beach
But before I arose on the scene
I saw the individuals rollin like a team
Drove a little bit futher saw mafia for life
Without a doubt everything was tight
But they gotta watch out for the King
Cause I can make my sixty-three sing
No pigs round, no I ain't no sucka
I'm doin sixty just hangin this muthafucka
More Bound To The Ounce is what counts so I show it
Even if it means I gotta total it
Swervin from lane to lane
A Cadillac just ain't the same
If you don't know what I mean and ya sittin
Come on, get in, let's go dippin

Let's go dippin, dippin through the streets (repeat 3X)

I felt like Cube cause today was a good day
For me to act the fool in my trey
I'm not worried bout a sucka tryin to stick and rob
I just buck em down with my thirty-odd
Creeped up to the beach, packed to capacity
Hoes walkin by 'Hi Your Majesty'
I said I'm not Young MC but what's the flava
I played it like Troop cause I'm not ??souped??
I park my shit on three wheels cause I'm ill
Compton's on the set with the real deal
This one's for the riders all around the world
Dippin through the hood wit your girl
Bumps in the back, sunroof top
Niggas lookin crazy so I'm reachin for the gloc
Every hood knows whether bloodin or crippin
Ain't nothin like a Sunday out just dippin

Let's go dippin, dippin through the streets (repeat 3X)[King Tee]
Well it's the musically drunken King Tee, with the fifth of funk
Guaranteed to make you jump like my 12 gauge pump, huh
I've been around since the days of the Sugarhill groove
Bust it out with "Act a Fool"
When I was seventeen, made some mad-ass green
Bought a six-fo' and some more gold things
Had to play the part for the G's on the block
So I bought a blue rag, bought a black Glock
Ran with the bunch that was out to get paid
The Westside of Compton over where the dead laid
On Greenleaf and Central, where niggas get mental
For a dollar, makin punk niggas holla
I used to kick it on my front porch, drinkin some 'gnac
While the homies stripped cars in the back
Lifestyles of the short and broke
Ain't worried bout shit, cause I'm a down ass loc

[Hook: repeat 2X]
So break the nigga off when you come to my hood
Cause the little B.G.'s, is up to no good
Jackin motherfuckers for they Dana Dane's
Got 'em jumpin out they shit like the House of Pain

[King Tee]
Yeah, a young man with the grown man's gun
Tryin to stay full while he's livin in the slum
I used to bang on fools like I was goin insane
From a notorious Compton gang
It's King Tee, strapped "IV Life"
Cause I don't trust niggas, I use the middle finger for the trigger
Ease back, watch bullets, flock through the sky
For the homies that died, and don't know why

Lifestyles of the short and broke
Ain't worried bout shit, cause I'm a down ass loc

[Hook]King Tee:
Hey! Here comes the funk of the future
And I can rock a rhyme from Perquorma to Hoover
The westside kid, quick to do a bid
Just watch me cock the Glock and make room
Shit man I got a 12 guage with the infared scope
I found a Tec 9 it use to be a radio
But now I'm a G, psycho, crazy
Fuck what you say and buck buck and I'm suazy
In my rag coup, front and back and it's quick
Punks with bump and that 3 wheel shit
Cause that's all you need when you need to be poppin'
Bust a U-turn on 3 wheels by the cops and
Damn if feels good to be triflin', you know what I'm sayin' cuz?
Who got the wallet, cause I'm buzzed

Get the fuck out my way, this is Compton fool just...

Hook:

King Tee:
Yo check it, they be like "He's a maniac!"
Yeah, bitch ant that's real, get the fuck up out the car and just peel
Yo punk I said right before I crash you in the grill
With the ass of my Glock, watch the blood spill
Gangstas got love the nigga King Tee
Just ask 'em who's the great weight, just watch 'em scream me
Quick with the punch, rollin' like clunch
Coming with the real shit, runnin' with a bunch of crazy niggas with wires
Hammers and plyers, your money and your blood
Plus the daytons and them tires
I be goin' so low, you can't get under
Niggas can't see me, ask Stevie Wonder, blazed in the chronic
Bumpin' Delphonics, and my shit's screamin' like that group Onyx
But hey, I'm the man that'll Bust That Ass open
When I was young me BB gun even has a scope so...

Hook

King Tee:
God damn it's King Tee with the funky bumrush
Smoke a lot of herb, but I never hit the dust
I can wreck them efx cause I ain't got my check baby
This ain't no punk shakin' shit, I'm goin' crazy
I think I'm goin' out of my head (say what!)
I said I think I'm going out of my head, so E-Swift
Since you rule in the cuts, give me the gun and just duck, come on

E-Swift:
Yo, I got a black case but it ain't for the mase
It's for the 4-4 I use to blast you in the face
Cause I be actin' kind of triflin' like my nigga Tela
Cock the hammer blow you out your socks and your Filas
Which way did he go? Which way did he go?
Niggas don't know, I got to play the down low
Punks jump up and get blasted to the ground
So motherfucker duck, I'm about to bust a round

HookFame, I'm the man that takes things over
Fame makes me loose, hard to swallow
Fame puts me there where things are hollow

[King Tee]

The world's famous, rugged with the superstar persona
Rough designer, the chubby alcoholic rhymer
Big timer, I'm known in places I haven't even been
Executed styles behind men
Oh God, I preach that old Hudd City gospel
My look's hostile, hittin Remy from the bottle
The fame is like I'm possessed wit game
And everywhere I go, hoes screamin my name
But I'm rollin, not that my bald head's swollen
I'm towin, ya fixed up, they'd rather see ya broken
I'm scopin often where the spotlights shine
Me and my crew drinkin tryin ta have a good time
But folks watchin, wearin khakis or Versace
They try to mack me, caught up in the papparazzi
I'mma look what the hogg had become
A top notch nigga with the fame game

Outro: RC

Is it any wonder, I'll reject ya first
Fame Fame Fame Fame
Is it any wonder, your heart's too cold to fool
Fame Fame Fame Fame[Intro: Xzibit]
Ay, what the fuck man? (*laughter*)
See, look, look, uhh

[Verse One: Xzibit]
I grab the mic and start breakin down niggas without no problems
Broadcastin live from the bottom
Ain't no mic checkin worse, kick some rhymes if you got them
But if it's whack, I draw back the cap for the peelin
Shoulda stuck to rock dealin
Cause it's the blood stealin, super villain
Chillin, stayin high like the ceilin
See there ain't enough room for the both of us
See it's a showdown, throw down, your best style I'll bust (yo)
I write rhymes that make niggas throw they sets up
Couldn't hold my style if you had a pair of handcuffs
In all disrespect
I'll snatch you by your neck and do a suplex and step
So nigga you can check my credentials
Just hard rhymes and instrumentals
Xzibit smash you wit a dental and a loaded pistol
No longer lookin in the window
I'll bust a field wit indo
Killin quarts of beer, Sadie's outta here...

[Verse Two: MC Breeze]
Like a fuse, start spreadin the news
It's ninety-four and Breeze is givin niggas the blues
I paid my dues, and now it's time to go on to the next mode
Make room for the kaboom, cause I'm about to explode
And drop bombs like a B1, cops I seize none
And niggas step up, I soak emcees son
Three seconds to detonate, you betta evacuate
No time to hesitate, you fuckin featherweight
I ain't the type to pick up the mic and catch the stage fright
I'll pull a gauge if I ain't paid right
To the promoters on tour
Short me a buck and a buckshot and the barrel is yours!
I'm psychopathic like Manson, ain't wit the dancin
But still I get more Cheers than Ted Danson
More dough than Marino or roles than Pacino
You beatin me? Yhat's only in your dreams ho
I'm not sayin I'm unbeatable, I'm sayin I'm untouchable
Livin comfortable just like a Huxtable
Plus I'm rollin with the crossroads
Move in fast foward, while you other suckers stuck in a pause mode
I goes deep like a great white, but I'mma stay black
No matter how high the pay stacks, or if my rep gets bigger
You might get take this nigga out the ghetto, but not the ghetto out this nigga

[Verse Three: J-Ro, Tash]
For the balls, basketballs, microphones gas and grass (hey)
Some of the few things J-Ro likes to pass
93 mandingo, 94 I'm the pharaoh
Cause I'm b-b-bad to the bone marrow
I get wild, with more styles than the martial arts
I need weed, I roll more grass than golf carts
April ninety-two you know the Ro was a looter
Now I'm writin raps on my laptop computer
J-Ro the tittie fiend, rap dean, wearin green
Been on the scene, since the age of thirteen
I learned I had to earn the mic, now's my turn
I got Furious Styles like Larry Fishburne

With the bitches tunin me in like it's the Young and the Restless
Next up to bust my shit from the L-I-K-S's
Yes it's the freshest with lyrics rough around the edges
I'll smoke you on the mic like a pack of Benson Hedges
But.. hold up wait, I'll bust rhymes that'll circulate
That'll "Wake yo' punk ass up" like MC Eiht
Cause I been rockin rhymes since the roof was on fire
So point me to the bitch who's the dopest butterfly'er
I'll make her break it down like she Patra when I catch ya
Broadway is on the tables while I throw these lyrica at'cha
So.. slow down before ya fuck wit my sound
You better do the hokey pokey and turn yourself around

[Verse Four: King Tee]
Now me watch get Doggy like Snoop, funky from my group
Make them wanna shoot, there it is whoop
Fool, I got props, bustin at the cops
Gettin what I got, blowin up the spots
Checkin out the scene, somethin like a dream
How I become a king, stuffin all the green
Coolest of the cool, a God damn fool
Breakin up the rule, I'm from the old school
So hey, busters speak, no wait busters preach
Signed by the each, trickin for the treat
Known to be the boss, tipsy off the sauce
Drunk off the funk cause Tha Alkaholiks floss
The real situation, so peep what you facin
The Zulu Nation on your Nubian station
Ready for the war, walk without a girl
I'm livin cherry mood with the diamonds and pearls...

You know what I'm sayin
Some of that old black shit, you know what I'm sayin
Comin from the West coast side, you know what I'm sayin
That crazy shit
Back off with that all other bullshit, what's up Jermaine
My man Breeze is in the motherfuckin house tonight you know what I'm sayin
My man Xzibit, yeah, Tha Alkaholik straight pumpin shit straight at you
From the signifyin Crew you know what I'm sayin
Day-alight, yeah, yeah, yeah
Check it out y'all? comin down tonight, broad way
Jamboree, this shit is straight pumpin, word up
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me
Let me do a motherfuckin back up[King Tee]
Get a taste of the heat while I burn down the streets
Time to recognize who wore the white sheets
Gafflin me up and I'm fightin cause they got me
Known as a King knowin what they did to Rodney
I know you know the deal, it's open season on my race
I'm black and I'm proud to be lootin in your face
But yet I'm real smart, cause see, it's a plan
To lock up and shut down the black man

[Yo-Yo]
Yeah, you can play that role like you ain't with it if you wanna
But it's on to the break of dawn
I said it's just 'a few good men' when we were fightin
I guess it'll be more good men now we're united
Now all of a sudden they wanna bring in troops
Niggas in my hood been gettin loose and buckin fools
But now we're gettin wiser, you can tell by the fires
That they're fed up, the war is on us

[MC Eiht]
What happened to the drive-by killings?
Ain't nothin poppin no more cause brothers now chillin
From every hood to block to corner to street
Not black-on-black, the other color gets beat
Mh, I guess it's time for brothers to turn the page and
Let out some rage and bang a Caucasian
Geah, MC Eiht got the pale face runnnin scared
Gang of blue, fuck the white, I'm down with the red

[B-Real]
Doin dirt, at the time I thought it couldn't hurt
So I became a jackin expert
Lootin, scootin uptown cause they're shootin up a clown
That fuckin pig in the blue suit
That pig, sow, buster-ass copper
Pointin my bazooka at your pork chopper
You passed me a lump just a month back
That's why I got my hand on the pump, jack

[HOOK 2x]
You can get with that, or you can get with this
You can get the boot, or you can get the fist

[J-Dee]
Heary heary, y'all come kick it, man
I never thought I'd see a thousand Crips in the Nickerson
Gardens, pardon my manners
I saw the Bloods and Crips wavin big black banners
Bandanas tied, straps on their side
Cause in the projects it was a lotta black pride
And I remember the time I couldn't answer my pager
Cause if you were slippin your enemy come and gauge ya

[KAM]
It's the KAM and Watts Up, damn, this is like a dream
It feels good, cause every hood is on the same team
Archrivals got the five-o's kinda nervous
They layin in the cut but I know they wanna serve us
And I'm certain it's hurtin Daryl Gates
He rather have a brother pressin California license plates
While the media gets greedier for ratings
It's 12 o'clock at night but I'm rollin gold Daytons
And it's cool cause ain't nobody trip but the cops
Deep jeep bass comin from the rag top

[Threat]
It took more than a letter to pull us black together
But that goes to show you, never say never
I seen the tape, I didn't have to see it twice
Never seen nothin like it in my life, 12 blind mice
Is this the end, where we begin
Makin friends with Mister Chen?
From the dirt to the streets to the avenues
Way, way deep, deep in the Zoo

[Ice Cube]
Would you believe
Not guilty, the filthy devils tried to kill me
When the news get to the hood the niggas will be
Hotter than cayenne pepper, cuss, bust
Kickin up dust is a must
I can't trust a cracker in a blue uniform
Stick a nigga like a unicorn
Born wicked, Laurence Powell, foul
Cut his damn throat and I smile

[HOOK 2x]
You can get with that, or you can get with this
You can get the boot, or you can get the fist[Verse 1: J-Ro]

Pooh-butts play the rear cause I'm making papes
The rhymes ain't no thicker than a skittle grapes
A lot of girls would like to thank me for the hanky-panky
On the mic I hold the belt, now I know no one could spank me
It took a long time for the people to hear my rhymes
Seems like I been rapping since my birth in '69
Sorry to keep you waiting, I run rhymes like Walter Payton
I get around like spokes on a Dayton
But I won't knock off, because I just rock off
The beats to get funky, like when you take your sock off
To all the white folks I would like to say, "Howdy"
And to all my brothers I say please quit acting rowdy
Wack MCs in ninety-two, ew you need to take a rest
The public don't you aim the best you're softer than a hookers chest
Raps, I make em, snaps, I make em
For duties moving booties cause I shake shake shake em
And I got rhymes, funky funky rhymes
E-Swift hold the needle down with nickels and dimes
I drink Olde English, St. Ides and Mickeys
When it's time to roll I throw on my black Dickies
On the mic I get wicked, like Wilson Pickett
I get the place jumping like a cricket when I kick shit
I'm from the West coast but don't sleep home-stimpy
Even if I was a paperboy you still couldn't rip me
I walk up and chalk up pairs like the Knicks
I'm all in the mix like snares and kicks
When it comes to rhymes I get loose like belt buckles
Those who chose to oppose this nose is felt knuckles

[Hook]
(Where you going to?) To the tip
(And what cha bout to do?) Bout to rip
Some people use the word funky too loosely
And just how many rappers say they kick it like Bruce Lee
(What's your favorite brew?) Olde E
(And what it make you do?) Go pee
It used to be about rhymes, all about rhymes
Now rappers rearranging and changing like times
I got it bad y'all, I got it bad y'all
When it comes to the pen and the pad y'all
I got it bad y'all, I got it bad y'all
When it comes to the pen and the pad y'all

[Verse 2: E-Swift]
Back the fuck up, give me room to breathe
Not too many niggas can flip the rhymes like these
I freak the technique as if it was a bitch
Got more soul than the pick with a fist
Pitch the ball, so I can beat it with the bat
Talk some shit, so I can smoke ya with my gat
I'm feeling kinda feeling kinda feeling kinda feeling kinda
Feeling kinda buzzed off a sack of chocolate Thai
My my my ho, I like to rip the shows up
Smack the hoes that walk around with they nose up
Run to the liquor store, before they close up
Buy a few 40s, cause daily I get to' up
Sit at the crib and write riggy-riggy-rhymes
Line after line after liggy-liggy-line
Yo I can get funky, buy my tape and bump me
To the break of dawn I hit the bud and pass it on
Hanging at the park, shooting craps on the weekend
My brown bag is wet cause my tall can is leaking
Staring at the cops, beating up on Rodney
While a pack of O.G.'s stepping to me trying to rob me
Just because I'm dope, niggas wanna smoke me
On the mic I get funky while you're doing the hokey-pokey
Dance steps, I think that you should leave to Paula
Alkaholiks is the shit, E-Swift's the smooth baller
Is slangin' these rhymes like a rock
Life ain't shit but money and a Glock
Don't punch a clock, but I clock a fat knot
So I can smoke a lot of pot that I roll up with tops
And ya ain't heard shit yet, I'm just gettin warm
Like hot butter on say what? The popcorn
I'm headed to the top, please give me my props
My beats are fat as fuck so bump my shit in your box
I love to hit the skins, but then again who doesn't?
I love to hit the herbs cause it leave me feeling buzzing
I dedicate this chumpie to the poets who can wreck
And to all the natty dreads I gots to give them nuff respect

[Hook]

[Verse 3: King Tee]
Up jumps the man with the loot
Rocking like a troop with the Alkaholik group
Everything is kosher, got a little taller
Living kinda phat cause King Tee's a baller
I just irritate the wack, leave em so confused
When I'm checking on the mic with the ones and twos
Sneak you a peek of the drunk technique
Can't stand up, need to take a seat
Baby baby baby it's the Alkaholiks
But I can freak the mic no matter how ya call it
Metaphors grand, and I'm the great man
Drink a whole fifth yes I can, yes I can can
The girls call me dick-em-down
Got that title rocking for the crown
Catch y'all later, around next weekend
I'm a Alkaholik and I'm late for my meetingArtist: Marley Marl f/ Tragedy, King Tee, Grand Puba, Def Jef, Chubb Rock
Album: Marley Marl In Control Volume 2
Song: Keep Control

(Chorus)
Keep control...

(Tragedy the Intelligent Hoodlum)
When I made arrest the president, America ate me
Spoke the truth that the gov't hates me
They labeled me a prejudice poet
I'm speaking the truth as I know it
I hold on but it's hard for me to handle
Too much lies, corruption and scandal
Cops want to kill a brother or two
Who do you call when the gang wears blue
I ain't going out like an Uncle Tom man
My gun is loaded and I'm itching to pull the trigger
I'm marking for death as a funky rhyme sayer
Corruption flows from the cops to the mayor
Mali troops will run through your resident
In my hand will be the head of your president
All you fess that made a check to throwdown
Will rise up for a political showdown

Chorus

(King Tee)
Yo, King Tee stepping in on a dark tip
Open your eyes and your mind and get a grip
Of the ropes and chains that kept us
Since we were black they didn't want to except us
But it's ok, I got my own plan
Cause yo, I ain't down wit your program
The natives cook, wash and clean
And to the rubbers that throw in the scene
M-A-N-D-E-L-A
Now you got a chance to hear what he say
Since they kept him locked up for so long
Cause his skin was black and his mind was strong
But we need to all stand together though
And let the red, black and green show
Become aware of yourself before it gets too late
Another message from King Tee the great

Chorus

(Grand Puba)
Yo bust it
Hung wit the flip, got a ?dooby? wig
Now she thinks she's all that shit, her man got zits
Hon living lovely, Miss Gouchi
Even got a Benz when she drives around wit all her friends
Ugn, miss quick fast in a heedy
Speedy, speedy, speedy, the bitch is greedy
Spend so fast, she got caught wit 4 kids
And the man caught a nice thick bitch
Now the bitch is on skid
Screaming how she hates her kids
The move for the bitch is a thing quick and easy
Think slick, she better get wit the wick
Cause foul, foul, foul is your style
You tried to run the race but you lost by a mile
See it everyday, it's the same old sorry song
How long must this go on

Chorus

(Def Jef)
Power now or never, together forever
And ever, sever make it endever
To enlight your brother when
I recommend to extend a hand
Expand it then wish strength to fend
Black women and men from the white power structure
They stucked ya in, stoled your culture and fuked ya
And you gave birth to a nation
You freelabel laid America's economic foundation
Blood, sweat and tears and fear for years
But now here was a peer to give you shift in the gears
The turn of the tables, knowledge and ables
Us to escape the sterotype wit the labels
And years of classroom fables, fiction
Fallacies all sorts and fabrications
?For sarge? even fuss
Star Spangled story, stigma and stunts

Chorus

(Chubb Rock)
I know this 11 year old kid named Jeffery Cowen
And knowing his father slowing
And his mother is hoeing
And now should he be growing
He's too young to be sewing
He should just chill and be flowing
I know he was being malested and sold
And his mom for being infected
Never check it, so I invested
My time and made sure little bro was looked at
Pops got evicted, not a smack
Pumped his fists and being that I'm a ?fugiless?
The bum got done by the one
And little Jeffery, no more tears left and drip
Mixed wit seaman on his lip, emotional trip
It confuses and bent ill thoughts
In the soul of the youngster
Is daddy a monster
That raw creates lip songs and heartache pain
Drys and open your eyes for the insane

Chorus[King Tee]
Now step up, to the King Tee's beer stand
And let me know what beer is grand
No, no, wait, I got somebody that might convince ya
Hold up, hold up, wait

[Ice Cube]
Once again it's on, I'm going out the front door
Ice Cube in the glass house, headed for the store
To get a beer that's better than the rest
The S-T-Period-I-D-E-to-the-S
And it'll put hair on your chest
In the black can, so won'tcha grab a six pack and
Get your girl in the mood quicker
Get your jimmy thicker, with St. Ide's Malt Liquor

[King Tee]
Hold up, hold up
So when you get a forty, roll to the spot
Hug and kiss your girl and screw the cap off the top
And get a taste of the beer that makes you tingle
And just remember that jingle

[Singers]
Here's something that's sweeping the nation by surprise
It's that fabulous malt liquor they call St. Ide'sIntro:

I hang MC's with my noose, watch me get loose

Cause I'm too hot to handle, got more soul in my pinky
Than a niggy pickin his afro in a leopard-skin dashiki
The freshest, yes it's, the rhymer with the bottle
Kickin it with my homie like Lamont do with Rollo
Live at the Apollo, they still couldn't do it
Cause even in New York the crew be buzzin' off the fluid
So testing [one], testing [two], testing [three]
Too much Olde E will make you pee
As you can see I'm the Alkaholik tipsy off the whiskey
Get with the clippers never nappy like Misty
I didn't grow dreads, cause dreads is for the rastas
Tha Alkaholik clique straight knockin' out imposters
Gots to roll deep like ants at a picnic
Get with the crew that's flowin like Likwit

[Verse Two: J-Ro]
Every night I pray to god please, no more wack MC's
I catch a few z's, wake up and bust these
I get over like a high jumper, freaks be on my weinie
Cause they know I'm packin more shit than Bandini
The freshest on the map servin raps with all fixins
E-Swift does the mixin, pockets fat like Rickie Nixon
[Ain't no party like a Alkaholik party]
So don't be a nitwit, get with the Likwit
[Ah yeah, ah yeah] Yeah a little louder a little louder a little louder
One two one two yeah just like that, yo
Yo, [flowin' like Likwit]
Ahh yeah [ahh yeah ahh yeah ahh yeah] flowin' like Likwit
Owwwwww, King Tee

[Verse Three: King Tee]
Here comes the Lik, or should I say Likwit
As I gets funky on a track that my nigga E-Swift did
Rollin with the Alkaholik group, call me trooper
Run of the mill skills got your neck in the noose
But hey, I be the K-I-N-G Tee for short
Big ballin nigga playin rhymes like a sport
Wicked when I kick it, yeah that's the ticket
Tossin up a forty still buzzin off the Likwit

[Verse Four: J-Ro]
You ain't got enough skill, to fill up a cup
So niggy won't you just shut the [hold up]
The girls call me dookie man cause I'm the shit can't you smell son
I gots more freaks than Prince Rogers Nelson
I can't be stopped I got hip-hop wreckin powers
I gotta say what's up to my buddy Ricky Flowers
We got that Likwit funk, we get drunk with the
.... [hell motherfuckin yeah][Verse 1: Xzibit]
Yeah..
Addicted to life, had to pay a heavy-ass price
Sacrifice worth waitin on the platinum and ice
I'm precise with the merchandise, came back like Christ
To change the game, while y'all niggas remain the same
Clear the lane, comin through like Kobe, you can't hold me
You can't stop me, ever since I dropped "Paparazzi"
I done watched the game unfold into some hideous shit
Like every idiot that can spit be droppin a hit
I transmit for the convicts, committed, never bullshitted
Shadowbox, detox, my own worse critic
It's like tryin to squeeze water from rocks
I negotiate the neighborhood stops and clean your clock with a Glock
Sick of niggas screamin they hot, but really they not
Beatin you all to the ground like six L.A. cops
Put your fist up in the air if you ever been shot
And lived to tell about it, never leavin home without it, c'mon

[Hook: Butch Cassidy]
There's no one out there, for us, to fear
I'll say it loud and clear..
Who can say they're close, to us
Speak now and you'll be brought, to tears

[Verse 2: King Tee]
They probably saw me on the 91 East, gettin off on Central
With the rag back, lookin like life's so simple
Tela take a loss, still floss, all bets
If Trife can't cover the house, call X
Likwit crew brothers, Blues Brothers
Move somethin, make killers do somethin, f'real
The bitch-made often politic with the skill
Now shit's all twisted, unlisted
Guns fixed it, best not speak about the Likwit
We gifted, twenty-four hours and still lifted
(*X*: Bitch keep your vagina) We drunk and ain't interested
Bitches come a dime and a dove, we ain't trippin it
Standin at the bar, soft-styled in the cut
"Ooh, boo wait, I think you had too much!"
Bitch what? Act right and pour it in a cup
The West and Eastside keep smokin them blunts, niggas

[Interlude: Butch Cassidy]
Let's get with it, I was born to trip
Stay on the lookout, ain't no time to slip
We ain't for games and shit
Change your spot, cause we're known to dip
No time for chasin hoes
I'm on a mission cause my cash is low
There's no need to speak on those
Doggy rags are the gangsta's clothes

[Verse 3: Defari]
There's two sides of my family, both sides from the ghetto
Pops Finnish choco-late, moms Mississippi yellow
Caramel, Cherokee black man, with a pedigree of excellence
Together we rise, no time for seperateness
My grandfather Snake was a Jake, or a jack
Of a smack to a bird who don't know how to act
Straight hustler, Mississippi moonshine smuggler
Good ol' wrangler in his day with that attitude of "Fuck ya"

[Verse 4: Xzibit]
Built to run forever, X the infinite
First line of defense to smash through the immigrants
Can't straddle the fence, it's all or nothin
Close the curtain, shut down your whole production
Don't be scared, be prepared, niggas do be bustin
Without thinkin; I mastered the art of hard drinkin
Yo, you wanna stop the X, try your best
I'm still fuckin with your pockets like the IRS, so yo

[Hook]

[Butch Cassidy]
Gather all around, to see
How we display our vicious skills
I done seen and heard, enough
Let's prove the West coast is for real

.. speak now and you'll be brought to tears ..[Verse 1: Xzibit, King-T & Tha Alkaholics]
Never has it been so bright
Gotta tell bitches, get outta my sight
Bitch, you blocking my light
I'm in Vegas front seat at the fight
I'm a alcoholic so you know I'm getting it right
Louis the 13th
Hennessy Black when I'm thirsty
I like my liquor dark milk chocolate Hershey
But first we
Gotta bang loose for the niggas that's been waiting on it
Patiently debating, even hating on it, bitch
I started this gangsta shit
House shoes and the shotgun, check the pinks)
The hangover is over, Tila created the lynx
(So tell the whole world to suck my dick, real shit
The addiction that you can't deny
Twelve steps to recovery, or else you die)
Yeah, this is for you and I
Fly, pelican, fly
Fuck trying to get by
Or we can put that bullshit to the side and kill 'em
L-B Cool S
Put a (?) out in Sweden out in (?)
So what makes a motherfucker so damn fresh?
We on the coast, yeah, you know to the left
Louie the 13th
Back down original, pack-town originator
I'm full of 40's like the g-thang refrigiator
Getting paper with my neighbor like that Clippers and the Lakers
Drinking Jack next to Jack, courtside at the Staples
Affiliation is vital for survival, we rolling
The caravan pulling up with a million trucks
(And I'm feeling like a million bucks
A all-star nigga still in Chucks
Louis the 13th
You can say what you say, just spell (?) right
Still got a lot of Louie's leftover from last night
We alcoholic minded, DJ rewind it
Bitches and liquor, we only fuck with the finest
King-T your highness
I'm timeless, y'all niggas is spineless
Drinking everything on the wine list
So yeah, nigga, come and catch this fade
Or break bread and we can all get paid
Louis the 13th
I got 14 courts, all sorts of imports
Premium spirits, mixed with marked lyrics
Don't fuck with Xzibit, I will crush your frame
Say my name, I will hunt you like Saddam Hussein
I'm crown royal
Coming out the comptown soil
Niggas in the kingdom stay loyal
It's the old English, linguist, distinguished genius
Always got a cup in my hand
Louis the 13th
Lets have a conversation bout my present situation
I don't need to be a star, I got my own constellation
Professional inebriation, we having a celebration
A live nation and heavy rotation
Patience
Hold more information than a free mason
It's a secret society, never try sobriety
SS Bugatti, live with the Illuminati
(?) picking up the bodies
We crash the party
(?) and Harley's mixed with Bacardi
Man, fuck everybody
