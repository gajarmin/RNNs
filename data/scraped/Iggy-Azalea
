[Produced by The Invisible Men]

[Intro/Chorus: Both]
All around the world, pretty girls
Wipe the floor with all the boys
Pour the drinks, bring the noise
(It's Iggy-Iggs!)
We're just so pretty!
All around the world, pretty girls
Jump the line, to the front
Do what we like, get what we want
(Where you at, Brit?)
We're just so pretty!

[Verse 1: Britney Spears]
Hey, don't you know that it's always the same?
From Australia 'round to LA
You can betcha', wherever the girls go, boys follow
We be keeping them up on their toes
They can laugh, but they don't get the jokes
Just you watch, they're so predictable
(Some things don't change...)

[Pre-Chorus: Both]
(The girls roll up)
Windows roll down
(Eyes on us)
Jaws on the ground
(Watch them go)
It's just so funny
(Like bees to the honey!)

[Chorus: Both]
All around the world, pretty girls
Wipe the floor with all the boys
Pour the drinks, bring the noise
We're just so pretty!
All around the world, pretty girls
Jump the line, to the front
Do what we like, get what we want
We're just so pretty!

[Verse 2: Britney Spears]
Tell me, is it true that these men are from Mars?
Is that why they be acting bizarre?
Every time I walk out of my house it's like, "Hey, baby!"
They don't see me rolling my eyes
They buzzing around me like flies
They got one thing on their minds
(Some things don't change...)

[Pre-Chorus: Both] + [Chorus: Both]

[Verse 3: Iggy Azalea]
Damn, still killing them softly
I would spend time with you but that'd cost me
They pray that Iggy-Iggy give 'em one more chance
But busy Iggy wouldn't even give 'em one more glance
See, it's a thin line between the beauty and the beast
Slim waist, thick cake, the whole world want a piece
Bad girl, good (ooh) would make you lose your mind
All of the boys begging Britney, hit 'em one more time
Iggs

[Chorus: Both]Tire marks, tire marks, finish line with the fire marks
When the relay starts I’m a runaway slave-master
Shittin’ on the past gotta spit it like a pastor
After, bash her, did it like doe like dasher, faster-motorbike faster
Iggy gotta get a bitch watch for my rapture
White bitch go, ’bout to blow like the wind
Penthouse too, roof top at the Wynn
When I win, when I win I win, no when I wid ’em they good like shin
Got hoes on call, got hoes on call to come through take a pro-to-call
Just damagin’ that’s my protocol
Dismantle ya, Australians on Slauson, no camera, I don’t care who you are
No condom rap gotta give it to you raw
Pitchfork point, better pass me the joint
Gotta twist this beat I’ma sprain my joint
Straight crack rock, ball till I pop, pop, pop
Pull my trigger, Rap City, no Tigga
Yeah shorty do it illa’ I’m raw no Digga’
What’s my muthafuckin’ name it’s Iggy not Jigga
Don’t compare me to her, throw the bitch in the ditch
Ruff ruff ho, kill the bitch I'm Vick
Sewed the game up stapled up in a stitch
Click-click pow D.R.U.G.S. gang, my clique
Look at my heels LV on it, ignorant art, everybody on it
Everybody want it, 666 got a three-car garage, driveway be The Omen
Boss like Cohen
Hate me, Chordz 3D can’t see me
Pockets better than a H3, I don’t see you like mace-me, ugh
D.R.U.G.S - click oh and we on - hater
On these hoes hairs no activator, whores fuck up when he activate-her
Cuz I’m goin’ out with my hand raised
’Bout to smack, smack, smack till my hand cave
On the bitch-made, honey I’m paid, I’ma get laid fuck yer man cave
Ya act like ya real, be real, son
Kinda spaced-out you bitches be duckin’
Better than ya girl, than the best, make the competition rest
Unless it’s sex, no less, I’ma fuck the whole game, I’m best
With my strap on, my vibrator, ’bout to Bust-a-Rhyme, no violator
Course no, I’ma feel myself
I’m a masturbator like "uh uh uh uh, fuck me, fuck me"
Now I’m off beat, my head hurts, I murk shit, I gets paper
Wash my mouth, I curse like a sailor - bitch!

[Outro: YG][Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
I feel like the sky is falling down
Ain't nobody here to play around
Push it to the edge, I won't back down
Cause it's time to go hard or go home
One way up, no way out
I give it all, all for the family
We stay up, no bail outs
Give it all, all for the family

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Five, four, three, two, I got one shot
You lose the love and respect, that's where the trust stop
New work, top drop
I roll up every fifteen minutes like a bus stop
And you can smell just how I'm smokin' when I burn out
And you can catch me ridin' dirty, but my car not
It's love and loyalty until my heart lock
Never turn your back, won't know how it turned out
I said it once, I'll do it again
I'm playin' the game, I do it to win
With you and your friend, that's thick and thin
That's me and my team, you know we gon' win
You know we gon' ball, you know we gon' ride 'til the wheels fall off
You know we gon' stick to the course, we ain't thinkin' 'bout y'all

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
M-O-N-E-Y, what I go hard for
Swingin' on the green like I'm tryna get a par four
You ain't sittin' at my table, hope you starve
Ho, don't be pushin' my buttons 'less you startin' up my car
Pressure make a diamond, that pressure made me a star
Got a method to my madness, to bring me down by the bar
People always askin' me how I got this far
My response is just to keep it honest and be who you are
Now they call me Mrs. Money like I'm married to the moolah
Just to measure my success I need at least a hundred rulers
Glory, hallelujah, I'mma take that ass to church
I'mma finish like I started, Iggy still got that work

[Hook] (x2)[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
First things first, I'm the realest (realest)
Drop this and let the whole world feel it (let 'em feel it)
And I'm still in the Murda Bizness
I can hold you down, like I'm giving lessons in physics (right, right?)
You should want a bad bitch like this (huh?)
Drop it low and pick it up just like this (yeah)
Cup of Ace, cup of Goose, cup of Cris
High heels, something worth a half a ticket on my wrist (on my wrist)
Taking all the liquor straight, never chase that (never)
Rooftop like we bringing '88 back (what?)
Bring the hooks in, where the bass at?
Champagne spilling, you should taste that

[Hook: Charli XCX]
I'm so fancy, you already know
I'm in the fast lane, from L.A. to Tokyo
I'm so fancy, can't you taste this gold?
Remember my name, 'bout to blow-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
I said baby, I do this, I thought that, you knew this
Can't stand no haters, and honest, the truth is
And my flow retarded, each beat dear, departed
Swagger on stupid, I can't shop at no department
Better get my money on time, if they not money, decline
And swear I meant that there so much that they give that line a rewind
So get my money on time, if they not money, decline
I just can't worry 'bout no haters, gotta stay on my grind
Now tell me, who that, who that? That do that, do that?
Put that paper over all, I thought you knew that, knew that
I be that I-G-G-Y, put my name in bold
I been working, I'm up in here with some change to throw

[Hook: Charli XCX]

[Bridge: Charli XCX]
Trash the hotel, let's get drunk on the minibar
Make the phone call, feels so good getting what I want
Yeah, keep on turning it up
Chandelier swinging, we don't give a fuck
Film star, yeah I’m deluxe
Classic, expensive, you don't get to touch, aow!

[Verse 3: Iggy Azalea]
Still stunting, how you love that?
Got the whole world asking how I does that
Hot girl, hands off, don't touch that
Look at it, I bet you wishing you could clutch that
That's just the way you like it, huh?
You so good, he's just wishing he could bite it, huh?
Never turn down nothing
Slayin' these hoes, gold trigger on the gun like

[Hook: Charli XCX]

[Outro: Iggy Azalea & (Charli XCX)] (x2)
Who that, who that? I-G-G-Y
That do that, do that, I-G-G-Y
Who that, who that? I-G-G-Y
(Blow-oh-oh-oh)[Intro]
Walk a mile in these Louboutins
But they don't wear these shits where I'm from
I'm not hating, I'm just telling you
I'm tryna let you know what the fuck that I've been through

[Verse 1]
Two feet in the red dirt, school skirt
Sugar cane, back lanes
Three jobs, took years to save
But I got a ticket on that plane
People got a lot to say
But don't know shit about where I was made
Or how many floors that I had to scrub
Just to make it past where I am from

[Bridge](x3)
No money, no family
16 in the middle of Miami

[Hook]
I've been up all night, tryna get that rich
I've been work work work work working on my shit
Milked the whole game twice, gotta get it how I live
I've been work work work work working on my shit
Now get this work (x4)
Working on my shit

[Verse 2]
You can hate it or love it
Hustle and the struggle is the only thing I'm trusting
Thorough bread in a mud brick before the budget
White chick on that Pac shit
My passion was ironic
And my dreams were uncommon
Guess I gone crazy, first deal changed me
Robbed blind, basically raped me
Rose through the bullshit like a matador
Just made me madder and adamant to go at em
And even the score
So, I went harder
Studied the Carters till a deal was offered
Slept cold on the floor recording
At 4 in the morning
And now I'm passin' the bar like a lawyer
Immigrant, art ignorant
Ya ill intent was insurance for my benefit
Hate to be inconsiderate
But the Industry took my innocence
Too late, now I'm in this bitch!

You don't know the half
This shit get real
Valley girls giving blowjobs for Louboutins
What you call that?
Head over heels

[Bridge (x3) + Hook]

[Verse 3]
Pledge allegiance to the struggle
Ain't been easy
But cheers to Peezy for the weeks we lived out of duffle
Bags is all we had
Do anything for my Mama, I love you
One day I'll pay you back for the sacrifice
That ya managed to muscle
Sixteen, you sent me through customs so
All aboard my spaceship to Mercury
Turn First at the light that's in front me
Cause every night I'mma do it like it's my last
This dream is all that I need
Cause its all that I ever had

[Outro](x2)
Now get this work (x4)
Working on my shit...[Produced by Max Martin, Shellback, and Ilya]

[Intro: Iggy Azalea]
Uh-huh! It's Iggy Iggs!
I got one more problem with you girl, hey!
(One less, one less problem)

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Hey baby, even though I hate ya
I wanna love ya, I want you
And even though I can't forgive ya
I really want to, I want you
Tell me, tell me, baby
Why can't you leave me?
Cause even though I shouldn't want it
I gotta have it, I want you

[Pre-Hook: Ariana Grande]
Head in the clouds, got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser, and realize that I've got

[Hook: Big Sean & Ariana Grande] (x2)
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
(I got one less, one less problem)

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
I know you're never gonna wake up
I gotta give up, but it's you
I know I shouldn't ever call back
Or let you come back, but it's you
Every time you touch me
And say you love me
I get a little bit breathless
I shouldn't want it, but it's you

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]

[Verse 3: Iggy Azalea]
It's Iggy Iggs! Uh, what you got?
Smart money bettin' I'll be better off without you
In no time I'll be forgettin' all about you
You sayin' that you know, but I really, really doubt you
Understand my life is easy when I ain't around you
Iggy Iggy, too biggie to be here stressin'
I'm thinkin' I love the thought of you more than I love your presence
And the best thing now is probably for you to exit
I let you go, let you back, I finally learned my lesson
No half-steppin', either you want it or you just playin'
I'm listenin' to you knowin' I can't believe what you're sayin'
There's a million you's baby boo, so don't be dumb
I got 99 problems but you won't be one
Like what

[Bridge: Ariana Grande]
One less, one less problem
One less, one less problem

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook x2][Hook: T.I.]
All I fuck bad bitches, I don't want no mediocre ho
Don't want no mediocre, I don't want no mediocre, no!
Bad bitches only, ain't no mediocre ho
Don't want no mediocre, I won't hit no mediocre, yeah
Bad bitch stuntin' on them mediocre hoes
On them mediocre, you stunt on them mediocre
7, bitches with me and ain't none of them mediocre
From they head to they toes they so far from mediocre

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Right hand in the air, I solemnly swear
I never fuck a bitch if she don’t do her hair, no more
You won’t get no dick if it’s a bush down there
Girl, I should see nothing but pussy when I look down there
Hey, come fuck with a nigga, what better to do?
He call and ask how you doin, tell him "Better than you", yeah
I’m kicked back with four pieces like a Kit Kat
Me fucking if you ain’t a dime, just forget that
Pretty face, fat ass, if she don’t have
Have one of these, well, I think I’ll pass
I just handed her the keys to a new drop Jag
When she took it, I took it back, you shoulda asked for a Benz
That’s mediocre bitch!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
Heard he want to lay it down on Iggy Iggy
Gave it to him twice, now he want a 3, Mike Bibby
Diva, but I need a bad boy, rest in peace, Whitney
Pardon me but I don’t think none of these bitches fucking with me
Want a billboard bitch? Stop running in place
Heels on me saying gimme 6 inches of space
Courtside while designer frames cover my face
Now everybody in the game wanna get 'em a taste
I’m still Grand Hustle first lady, fuck you pay me
Bet he won't go 12 rounds with the million dollar baby
I can change your life quick, stop playing with me
And if you ain't talking money what you saying to me? Iggs

[Hook]

[Verse 3: T.I.]
I'm in Brazil with a bitch
Catch me in a mansion in the hills with a bitch
Get her out them tennis shoes, throw some heels on a bitch
I’m the type of nigga split a mil with a bitch
Hold up, only if she bad though
Out here trying to find someone that better than my last ho
Take her to my castle, drown her in my cash flow
Say your dick so little she can fit it in her asshole
Told me she can't ride this shit no further than a cab go
Said I got that don dick, she wanna be my tutor
So she give me brain, getting head on the scooter
Had sex on the beach from Bermuda up to Cuba
I done fucked a lot of dimes but I’m looking for a cuter bitch
You the shit, what she say when she got to sit
When I ain't around, give a damn who you do it with
Super thick, pretty face, ménage à veinte
20 at the same time, wanna get ya rent paid?

[Hook][Intro: Watch The Duck]
You ain't the type of lady that's known to fuck around
Keep your mind on your money, and you ain't looking to settle down
Girl, you keep it 100, 100, 100
When you're 'round me, yeah
That's why I keep it 100, 100, 100
When you're round me, girl
When you come around me
When you come around me
Yeah, girl, you keep it 100, 100, 100, when you're 'round me
Girl, when you come around me


[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
Imma keep it 100, I'm a boss chick but he run it
No Michael Kors just Tom Ford
Saint Tropez, I'm like bonjour
In Spain wearing that Balmain
Lanvin, Givenchy
On the top floor of that penthouse
I got ten toes on that concrete
Keep it G with the money, I ain't gotta lie about shit
I don't need the money, I can buy my shit
Heard in the streets that he fucked that bitch
He know imma put his ass out my shit
Paid one million for that drop six
And he got the Glock in my cockpit
Them other chicks he get caught with
I'm the bitch he gonna rock with
They talk shit but we bought shit
Fly Aussie on boss shit
When he need to be, where he need to be
I tell him "go on, it ain't no thing to me"
Gotta hit that thing, bring that back witcha
Let me thumb through the check if you wanna get sexy
You knew I was high class ass when you met me
My money tall, it's too bad for y'all
Your dough as short as Joe Pesci
I'm a fancy bitch but I'm ratchet
Not like the bitch you had, ain't never had shit
Respect that, how I come around, no run around
You better humble down
Them games, ain't gonna play none
Keep it A1 since day one, yeah

[Hook: Watch The Duck]
You ain't the type of lady that's known to fuck around
Keep your mind on your money and you ain't looking to settle down
Girl, you keep it 100, 100, 100
When you're round me
Yeah, girl you keep it 100, 100, 100 when you're round me
Girl, when you come around me

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
Bankrolls'r'us, we got it
You know how we ride
No credit, no debit, no thanks
My clique pay cash everything we buy
See me walking by with my nose in the sky
Make you be like "Damn bitch, can't say hi?"
Then I hop in the drop and wave goodbye
As I drive through the tunnel looking like Lady Di
Why stress myself when he ain't there?
Let's see how he likes seeing me out there
You know how many dudes want me out there?
Just stop thinking about it
You got no idea
Don't try me man, you know I will
Throw this brick through your wind shield
Knife your nice new Rover Wheel
That fireplace? Your clothes in there
If I know you two in there
No asking what you doing there
Imma send my crew in there
You two gonna be ruined there
You violate, I demonstrate
Especially if I'm true to you
And when I come around I keep it 100 as usual

[Hook: Watch The Duck]

[Bridge: Watch The Duck & Iggy Azalea]
100, 100 as usual
(When I come around I keep it 100 as usual)[Hook: Iggy Azalea]
Motherfuckers calling my phone
1-800-Bone
Boy, ain't you know?
I can back it up like a tonka truck
So call my phone phone
1-800-Bone
Say you got that gun?
That AK-47
Bang! bang! bang!

[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
Iggy got that secret service this that presidential shit
Get the busy tone when ya call my phone and my voicemail full of messages
Say you got that AK-47 well let me see you shoot it
Eat it up, beat it up boy don't bruise it
Put ya hands on it don't slip don't lose it
Bad bitches in my chat room, my chat room be poppin
Turn that chat room to a freak show when them bad bitches get topless
Put it on ustream for the whole world so the whole world can see it
Got that hotline, and it's about time for me to swap it out, I gotta re-up
They saying, "Iggy, oh, Iggy," they wanna play with that kitty
They calling, blowing my phone up, wishing they could kick it with me
The way I'm stunting I'm hurting felines, they wondering what I'm getting
A hustler charging all of you customers by the minute

[Hook: Iggy Azalea]

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
I double G Y, Iggy
Who fuck with I? Not many
Well know like them four turtles
Shredder, Bebop, and Rocksteady
That late night call be the beddy-bye
Now tell me, who the fuck are you sleeping on?
Round trip flight where the fuck I want
Doing everything you bitches don't
Private parties on roof tops
Exclusive shit when I shoe shop
Other hoes just crew hop, while I'm pulling up in the new drop
1-800-Bone thug
That freak shit I put you on some
You could try all night but I won't come
(you could try all night but I won't come)
You better make sure you ready
These killer instincts is deadly
They calling two at a time, got that 3 way on my telly
My hotline always ringing, I got them specials and deals
You know my sex is a weapon, they lining up to get killed

[Hook: Iggy Azalea]

Bridge:

Let me go stupid
Go ape shit
Go dumb
Go insane
In the membrane
That straight jacket shit
I'm a crazy bitch[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez]
I been down since day one, yeah
I'm the only one that's been right here
Why you acting like you don't care?
I been down since day one

[Pre-Hook]
Don't let the tables turn
Don't let the bridges burn
Been down for you, don't get it confused
Boy you could lose your turn
Don't let the tables turn
Don't let the bridges burn
Cause everything could change in a matter of days
Depending if you've learned

[Hook: Jennifer Lopez]
Why you acting like that?
You gon' miss me when I'm gone
Why you acting like that?
(Why you acting like that?)
Why you acting like that?
You gon' miss me when I'm gone
Why you acting like that?
When I leave I'm taking off

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez]
Baddest bitch in the world right here
You ain't even gotta go no where
Boy you better watch the way you walk
Cause if you trip you're gonna fall, oh!

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]

[Verse 3: Iggy Azalea]
Well shit, she ain't me
My love cost too baby, ain't nothing free
Check my angle, daddy, you could call me angel, daddy
Uh, but you gon' turn your beauty right into a beast
Now, this is the business or pleasure, let's keep 'em separate
I ain't tryna be second, just for the record
See you slippin' you trippin' just thought I should let you know
I admire your effort but I need better love
See many men try to play me 'til they get scared away
Told 'em that's a fall, try out another day
This is different, now I'm seeing that it isn't
Promise I'm not gon' cry here like Mary J
Now ain't that funny, that you was something special 'til
I noticed that you just like these losers who come in severals
But I, know that if you leave you comin' right back
So my question boy is, why you acting like that?

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook][Hook: Tinashe]
All hands on deck
All in front all in the back just like that, like that
I'mma blow your mind take it out on the floor like that, like that
All in the front all in the back just like that, like that
I'mma blow your mind like that

[Verse 1: Tinashe]
Wasted Heart
You took the last bit of love I've ever had
You took a good girl and you turned me oh so bad
Kiss your old bae good bye, she's dead and gone (dead and gone)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tinashe]
Wasted hard
Done this to death, do us apart
I watch you fold like a house of cards
Kiss the old me goodbye she's dead and gone, dead and gone, dead and gone
One by one, I watch you fall down, watch you fall like dominoes
Take no prisoners, search and destroy
Baby look at what you've done
One by one, I watch 'em go down, watch 'em fall like dominoes
Watch 'em go down, watch 'em go down, watch 'em go down

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Iggy Azalea]
Iggs
Every night another city, different time zone
All I wanna do is get my shine on
Come and deal with Iggy, get your mind blown
New coupe, no roof, got the mind gone
Shittin' on you even when I play polite
These Saint Laurent sneakers, not no Air Nikes
I did it all, seen it all twice
Know I gotta get the money, early morning, late nights
Pull up in the S-Class, leave in a Wraith
Murder mami in designer, know that murder be the case
Tell them hating bitches go and simmer down
I'ma get the paper 'bout as quick as word get around
Posters of me on the wall in your hubby house
What you getting, I been had it and don't want it now
Far as fashion and this rapping, I'm who run it now
Walkthroughs cost a hundred thou, young Iggy owww

[Verse 4: Tinashe]
And you know that I tried
Really gave my all
Everything we built
Baby you let it fall, you let it fall
And now you want me
Want me back now
And the thing that's so funny
Cause baby I'm long gone, I'm long gone

[Hook] x2[Instrumental]

[Intro: Bro Safari]
You won't believe this

[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
I wanna take it to a new level
Rolex and a new bezel
Cameras flash everywhere I walk now
It even sounds like money when I talk now
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
First class when I dash
Ain't no other rappers near me
Just to get this type of paper
I might need customs to clear me
Bought some Cartiers just to see the haters clearly
Playing while i'm workin'
Ten thousand for a Birkin
You on Instagram lurkin', prayin' that we meet in person
Imma boss, you a turnin' model, shake, get it perfect
Bitch you look like Ms. Piggy
We like where the hell is Kermit?
I'm in position to kill it
Give a damn if you feel it
I was thinking about buyin' this car
You ain't in the building
Mind on my millions
Ain't got no time for no feelings
I come from the bottom baby
I need my money on ceilings
New classic, the new killa
Lookin' in gold mirrors
And feelin' like who's realer?
Wonderin' who's iller than the illest bitch alive
Find me someone, i'll be surprised
Stamps all in this passport
Shot glasses in Glasgow
Feelin' like what more could we ask for
Talkin' that shit cause i'm an asshole (uhn)
Fly as hell in this new Chanel
Pounds of [?]
I can't stand next to a basic
Cause ain't nothin' about me basic
Y'all know what I been on
Y'all know that I been on
Mass murder these beats
Kill everything that I get on
Perfect when I get my spit on
Small talk I don't trip on
Rocking that Versace
Can Iggy Iggy get a big on?

[Instrumental][Produced by 1st Down of FKi]

[Intro]
TRAPGOLD...

[Verse 1]
I got twenty racks on my new jeans, I got ten more in my blue jeans
I walk in and I turn up, pimp tight like I'm permed up
I heard broke bitches talkin' like they rollin' like us
Man, these bitches sound shermed up
And these bitches be mad at us cause these bitches so down to fuck
Claim that shit, I can bang that shit
Fuck me, fuck a team, I'mma train that bitch
I hope you ain't wife that bitch
Cause I know a couple homies that'll pipe that bitch
Lifestyle flashy like a Nikon pic
And your bitch chose me cause you walk out with
My ass thick and my drinks mixed, say I'm sick, I say no shit
Better fo' drip, and that's a fo' sip and all my flows is slow piff
Closed case, I'm killin' shit, heard your flow, I'm not feeling shit
My brand right and I'm on one and these bitches don't want none
(These bitches don't want none) (x2)

[Hook] (x4)
I shine bright cause I grind, bitches hate, I don't mind
My heart's in it, I'm authentic, it's clear to see it's my time[Sample: Niki & The Dove]
Last night, we got married in a taxi
I swear I loved you, yes I love you like there's no tomorrow
And I've got no time, for second thoughts now
We got tonight and then I have to go

(D.R.U.G.S.)

[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
I know you want it
So why prolong it?
Perfect time right now
Gimme that look, I'm a hop up on it

Give it to him down in the parking lot
In the backseat, in the backseat of the car

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
Here we go, up and down to the beat
Never caring if they peep cause the windows fog
Gotta get it when I get it, get it right, get it good
Get it good while it's good, it's the shit for all

But the way you touch me, my dress come off
Drop get you rocking then the top come off
And my top come off then we bring it hard

[Pre-Hook:]

What you looking at, do I got something in my eye?
Do I got shit up on my face, or did my hair catch on fire?
Cause you really really staring, am I something that you like?
Geez, ask for my number or you can fly kites
See I'm 'bout to get with it, I'm getting ratchet and livid
You think I'm cool, then forget it
You feeling froggy then ribbit
Be like banana and slip it, before your melon I'll split it
I bet you know what you see, oh my girl she deserve a
Beat down

[Bridge: Iggy Azalea]
Stop, wait
Think about it

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
Work, work, run up, if you want some
Hear the drums how they beat here, that's how you done
Wait, I should think about it, never mind it's a waste
When the bitch hit the ground, how these Louboutins taste
I'm sorry, club promoter, let's put this in the past
It's just that bitch kept on staring, so I had to whoop that ass

[Hook: Iggy Azalea]
It's a party in your face, I'm about to dance on it
'Bout to dance on it, 'bout to dance on it
It's a party in your face, I'm about to dance on it
'Bout to dance on it, 'bout to dance on it
You win some, you lose some
But her, it's her day
You win some, you lose some
But her, it's her day
Beat down
It's a party in your face, I'm about to dance on it
'Bout to dance on it, 'bout to dance on it

'Bout to dance on it, 'bout to dance on it

[Bridge]

Beat down

[Verse 3: Iggy Azalea]
Check it out ladies, don't take no lip
Take no lip, take take no lip
If you ride for your girls, then pump your fist
Pump your fist, pump pump your fist
Now swing it at the ho that you think looking funny
If she came with a man then take all his money
It's the year of the woman, go grab a can of these whoppings
And then as soon as she looking Aoki she gon' get it
Beat down[Intro:  MØ]
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg...

[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
Pulled up looking picture perfect, baby
High price, but I'm worth it, baby
Can't play with ya, I've been busy workin', baby
Gettin' faded in the European, swervin', ayy
Look, describe Iggy groundbreaking what the word is
Hit the stage, ass shakin' like I'm nervous
When in New York, I be parkin' right on Madison
This ain't no accident, I'm killing 'em on purpose
I-G-G... why did she just have to do it
Baby ride with me, fly living, there ain't nothing to it
And my waist slim, ass fat, you gotta have it
Get my bake on, cake long, that's automatic

[Hook: MØ]
I know you like the way I turn it on
I'm out here with my friends
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it
If you don't do this right, you're going home alone
I guess you'll have to beg
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
P-P-P-Pussy power, pay me by the hour
I need me a Braveheart, can't deal with a coward
I tell him if he ain't ballin', he should hit the showers
If I pick you, you lucky, baby, this money ours
All yellow gold on me, like I'm Trinidad (James)
Sittin' drop top, wondering where the ceiling's at
I know my old thang wanna bring the feeling back
But I got a new thang, baby, I ain't feeling that now
Iggy Iggy Iggy, can't you see?
That everybody wanna put they hands on me
See I be on this money while your man on me
And I need another hand with all these bands on me, wait

[Hook]

[Bridge: Iggy Azalea (MØ)]
Get up out my face like who d'you think you are?
Talking all this trash like blah-de-blah-de-blah

Get up out my face like who d'you think you are?
Make me wanna laugh like har-de-har-de-har
(Oh ay oh) nuh-uh (oh ay oh) nuh-uh

[Hook]

[Outro: MØ (and Iggy Azalea)]
Got you hooked boy, I'm like a drug

You can look, boy, but don't you touch
If you want my love make me give a fuck
(Make you beg for it, I'mma make you beg for it)[Hook: Iggy Azalea]

She know she a freak, yeah

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Popping, popping, popping tags, always with a shopping bag
She go to Clark Atlanta but she always hopping class
All-star weekend, she be where the lobby is
Looking for that slap stick, all she need is hockey pads
She just be scrambling, looking I did be clean
Tossing that box like shipping and handling
She be going, yeah, she be doing anything
Natural, stage jumpin off, she a trampoline
Straight, straight boinking this bitch
I'm 'bout my head, flip up coin in this bitch
She brought her overnight bag and it's fendi
She wanted Benihanas but she settled for some settle for some Denny's

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
Red bottom ass heels on
Hair laid, it's fly shit
Twerk something, I might let you through
But don’t touch nothing, that’s my shit
Oh that’s cute, same outfit
Different color, same swag
She jumping off when she leave the club
Body spray in her Gucci bag
Pole going ass ho
You and your main bitch front row
Hoes lined up outside
Wanna shake that ass at my show
Let me tell you something you don’t know
On my neck and wrists is trap gold
My ass fitted in Levi
Swag so rodeo
It’s bitches in the building and it’s bitches on the couch
She tidy up her best friend, before she leave that house
She got her best friend, that's a freak bitch
A freak bitch, tickets to my concerts on her wishlist

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
B.Y.O.B, bring your own bitch
She don’t sleep, she smoke trees
No boyfriend, got cold feet
Low key, she’s so sweet
Just lonely, but so freaky
Acting wild like ho please
Fly around, I go deep
She don’t creep, I fuck hoes
She cool with that, she love those
It’s funk so her gusto
If not so she one of those
Til it’s come close, gotta love Jones
What’s under your clothes I wanna know
Her ass huge, her back screwed up
With a bunch of bad tattoos
Me she make an exception but she usually fuck black dudes
My cashews all in her mouth
In the club, more than her house
Come through, she might hit the loud
Go animal like in and out
Threesome, I need some
My hoes is European, Norwegian, Puerto Rican, even some vegan

[Hook][Hook: Rita Ora]
I'm gonna love ya
Until you hate me
And I'm gonna show ya
What's really crazy
You should've known better
Than to mess with me, honey
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya
Gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby

[Verse 1]
This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
First we're both down to play then somehow you go astray
We went from nothing to something, liking to loving
It was us against the world, and now we just fucking?
It's like I loved you so much, and now I just hate you
Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothing for us, ain't no place in between
Might be me believing what you say that you'll never mean
Like it'll last forever but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you I wouldn't be stuck singing this song
You were different from my last but now you got em mirrored
And as it all plays out I see it couldn't be clearer
Now sing...

[Pre-hook: Rita Ora]
You used to be thirsty for me
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, web that you weave
So baby now rest in peace (It's all over with now)

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna l-l-l-love you until it hurts
Just to get you, I'm doing whatever works
You ain't never met nobody
That will do ya how I do ya
That will bring you to your knees
Praise Jesus, hallelujah
I'ma make you beg for it, plead for it
'Till you feel like you breathe for it
'Till you'll do any and everything for it
I want you to fiend for it
Wake up and dream for it
'Till it's got you gasping for air
And you lean forward
'Till they have a CAT scan to check on your mind
And it's nothing but me, on it (on it, on it)
Now it's me time, believe that
If it's yours and you want it
I want it, promise I need that
'Till I'm everywhere that you be at
I can't fall back or quit
Cause this here is fatal attraction
So I take it all or I don't want shhh

[Pre-hook]

Wanna tell all of my ladies to get up on the floor and just shake it, shake it
Ya'll know what I've been on, ya'll know that I've been on

Girls with the cheeks, put 'em hands in the air

But fact we girls with the big fat booty too fancy to ever play fair

I tell a bitch I'm bossing
So make ya offer, if it's money we're talking
Man step in my office
Promoters calling me often
From the Bay out to Boston
And overseas they know what it's costing
Bitch I'm bossing!

[Verse 1]
I make rainy days, it's a drought for you
Y'all ain't crusin' my altitude
I'm a boss bitch, I let you spread the rumors
Yeah you talking shit, but not an ounce is true
Million dollar misfit, my money pilin'
All over the lettuce like Thousand Island
My dough running like a broken faucet
I'm the landlord, you in the housing projects
In the drive-thru, makin' bank deposits
Crazy money, insane asylum
Boss Chase, got her taxes filed
And then I blow the rest while I’m at Saks shopping
Amsterdam, Germany and Holland
Changing your currency to dollars
It's Iggy bitch, and this boss shit
Where the pounds at?
No trending topic

[Hook][Intro x3]
Make it bounce

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna hurt ya but I'm about to work ya
Watch your mouth drop real low
I'm turning you up, I'm burning the clutch
Full speed, both feet to the floor, feet to the floor
DJ running it back once more, time to party that's all I know
Grab somebody tell 'em, "Baby, baby, baby let's go!"

[Hook]
Bounce, make it, make it bounce (x3)
Shake it, break it, make it bounce
Bounce, make it bounce (x3)
Shake it, break it, make it bounce
Oh-oh-oh-oh (repeat)

Oh-oh-oh-oh (repeat)

[Verse 2]
Iggy Iggy, gettin' 'em tipsy
Tippin' em broads, hundreds and fifties
Pullin' up, NASCAR, black car
Shittin' on everyone, sippin' whatever we feelin'
Real real good, hands to the ceiling
Dancin' we dizzy, we spinnin' we spinnin'
All about money, the night's never ending
We party till morning, tomorrow we kick it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Let ya hair down and shake that shit, shake that shit, shake that shit
Sweat it out, go nuts in this bitch
Dip it, spin it, and watchin' my hips
I see you watchin' my hips
Crazy, move your body like Swayze
Round and round, shake it, break it, make it bounce
It's a fucking celebration, go-go-go
Girl shake 'em down like you made it, get low-low-low
Then show the good like you're wasted, po'-po'-po'
And spray the crowd with amazement, fo' sho-sho-sho

[Outro]
Go nuts, hands up, get crazy (we go) (x3)
Go nuts, hands up, get crazy

I never meant to hurt you
I never wanted to see you cry
For you

D.R.U.G.S

[Iggy: Verse 1]
Usually I don't like thugs, who bust guns but
I got a thing for this burgundy one
Even though I can't read him, too much dirt on his palms
For me to see exactly what he got in his heart

Even though I know the seventh letters hold it in forever
Even though he got an ex who's still around, he will do better
When he ready, when he pick me to be honest, it is all the same as long as you are with me

I see other couples flimsy, we be homies till you ready
When other girls you fucking start to make you feel empty
I'll be there for that scene, I'll be waiting in the wings
For you to turn to my page - let beautiful begin with me

[Sample, Repeat Until Ending of Song]
For you
Uh, you know what I'm talking about, baby?
I never meant to hurt you
I never wanted to see you cry
For you[Hook x4]
I'mma change your life, I'mma change it

Yo, Hustle Gang homie, real talk, no bullshit

[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
You used to dealing with basic bitches
Basic shit all the time

From a standby to a frequent flyer
Hop out your past life
And I'll renovate your future
Then I integrate my genius shit
We purchasin' not perusing
Yeah I love your hustle, baby
Just let me add a little bit of muscle, baby
Joint venture, we'll partner up until the shares are up
And I up your wages
On a private island, Dolo
One across the Cono
Them broads before me was locals
Through customs accustom your wardrobe, damn
Stamped passports where they all pass ports
Til the clocks fast forward
There'll be dark blue shores
Where they don't do chores
We just get chauffered
Damn, this is the life
Exclusive shit with all access granted
In the country where the accents are grand
And they landin' on top of all the mansions

[Hook x4]

[Verse 2: T.I.]
If you could listen more than you speak
I get you everything that you need
I'm talking 'bout red bottoms LV
Even Extensions Plus in your weave
I be blowing on strong weed when we ride
And everybody just lookin'
But ain’t nann nigga gon' hop up
They like "Nah shawty, she tooken"
I'mma get you you up out that corner shop
Put you up in Neiman Marcus where you supposed to shop
Hey let me show you that watch
You supposed to wear, hey get up out
That Honda Civic get your ass in here
Tell your mom and dad that you straight
Don't worry 'bout it you got it
You fly over in coach and fly back in a jet,
Hustle Gang on your chest,
Ain't no time for no stress

[Iggy Azalea]
We spend our winters in the Summer of Australia
Eating crumpets with the sailors
On acres without the neighbors
We fast-forward four years more
We a long way from piss poor
And all the shit that we endured
I told you what you was in for so

[Hook x4]

[Bridge: Iggy Azalea]
Once you go great, you never go good
You never go back, even if you could

Woke up and you lived your dreams

And if I could have one wish its that I die rich

Real talk, while you bitches just play with it
Long hair don't care, Bad bitch. dont stare

So turned up don't wanna turn down

Like got damn, I mean oh, shit! cold bitch and my flow sick
So sick I might cough and hack and then toss some racks
Like count alla that
Nah, now im about my business. And I know these hoes ain't with it
Wanna talk about paper? I got it. Broke muthafuckas might not get it
Now murder murder kill, hundred dollar bills
Real bitch till I die, now tell me how it feel, huh?!

Chorus:
Demons, Cmon!
You gotta vision, you're on a mission…
Demons, Live on!
And when I die, hang me high!

B Section:
Real bitch till I die, Now tell me how it feel, huh?!

Verse 2:
Money up so its going down, I got enough dough to go round and round
Im talkin round and round, but no merry-go
Hoes see me out and say "there she go"
You know point and look. You know stop and stare
Yeah im racked up, but not stopping there
You see me in the store then im copping that
Clutch full of that green, Rodman hair
You know first class champagne designer life is my campaign
I been ill and I can't change, so ill its a damn shame
But I spend it like its no damn thang what you made in a year is just chump change
Low paper, really no paper, huh?
Bitch gone do it, watch me run through it. You don't fuck with who? Bitch you sound stupid
Bitch gone do it, watch me run through it. And we ain't never stopping. act like ya know it!

Chorus:
Demons, Cmon!
You gotta vision, you're on a mission…
Demons, Live on!
And where I die, hang me high!

B Section:
Real bitch till I die, Now tell me how it feel, huh?![Verse 1]
I remember when it used to be simple
But all this cash it just complicates things
And all this money we into
It will drive you crazy but it only makes me go harder
Grow stronger and get tougher when the road get longer
Sometimes you gonna think that it's too much on ya
But think what I'd be doing if this wasn't going on
So I just keep pushing when I'm being pulled in every direction
Now I'm popping so the they watching every step of my progression
Sometimes fame like a curse latched to my blessing
On the road to the riches turning earth into heaven
Dear Lord, if you hear me, I don't need not a new friend near me
Cause I don't want none of that fake love
Cause how I'm looking at it, all of that be made up

[Hook]
I remember when I wasn't this big
And now ya'll wanna act like ya'll helped me get here
Oh now everybody wanna love me
Try to knock me down but I'm strong
I did all this on my own
Ain't got no time for no new friends
So for now just leave me alone

I don't need y'all anyway (6x)
I don't need y'all

[Verse 2]
Making each and every song like it might be my last one
But still making sure the cash come
Still ain't forget the times when I didn't have none
Back against the wall feeling like I had to grab some
That's when, I took time and I figured it out
I'd rather deal with the stressing more than living without
Take a one way trip to the top one time
Let you have it for a minute now I want mine
Same girl on the cover of the magazine
Was the one hiding pain that you hadn't seen
Talking 'bout
No money, no family
Sixteen in the middle of Miami
Same critics love me nowadays couldn't stand me
Now we talking 'bout VMA's and a Grammy
But in due time, turn nothing into something
So now I need money, put it all in my discussions

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
And if you wasn't here when I was down
Then you won't be here when I'm up
Now the same one you looked over
Be the same one that blew up
Ain't it funny how this life thing works?
When you think it's finished is when it all begins
Go from doubts to having the thought it might work
It goes up and down then it starts again
When I reminisce sometimes I can't even keep a dry eye
But my how time flies by when you on top of the world sky high

[Hook][Hook 1] (x2)
I'm looking up North while you touching down South (mwah)
I'm saying where I want it so you takin' it out

[Hook 2] (x2)
Keep on going, going, going, going, going down South
I'm going, going, going, going, go and kiss that mouth

[Bridge] (x4)
Kiss that, mwah, mwah, mwah...

[Verse 1]
He went down and he kissed it
This pink pussy no lipstick
More like lip gloss when it's sticky
Ain't no bitch bossin' like Iggy
I'm gettin' head with my shades on
He head over heels, he way gone
Got his face looking all painted on
When he done getting his taste on
But ain't no returning the favor
When you get done, put your name on this waiver
Makin' a statement bout how you ate this
Banana pudding and vanilla wafer
I'm giving it to you no chaser
But this pussy be wet on the rocks
Iggy do fades and braids it really don't matter
This pussy gone drip on them locks
That Hello Kitty, no pencil pouch
This pussy neat like its stenciled out
I got his tongue shining call him Mr. Clean
It's like Listerine when he rinse it out
Got these girls callin' on missions now
They say they mad cause they missin' out
But I'm verifying his face card
And he say he love it when he kiss it now

[Hook 1 + Hook 2]

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
I'm jumping out the gym like a motherfucking Laker, ho
Do me one favor, don't do me no favors
And I get 380 every time he 360
Got my old dude calling, got my new dude with me
Started in the A then he licked me to the Bay
Pit stop in Texas, slow it up, drank
Asking, "Baby how it taste? I bet it taste good."
I be cooling out on Slauson, I bet it taste hood
Got me like, "Yeah, I'm Gucci, Ferragamo and Louis."
No department stores I'm in boutiques
If it ain't high class, it don't suit me
Got that bubblicious, that chewy
Make your man act like a groupie
You like fruit? Then imagine I'm smoothie
Pussy monster, give me that Tunechi
Said he wanna blow fish, I'm hootie
Follow my legs to my booty
Self sufficient I do me, broke hoes think I'm bougie
Moody? Who me?
Wild and unruly
So I drop the top on that two-seat while his tongue roll on my tootsie

[Hook 1 + Hook 2]

[Bridge][Intro]

Speed it up now go slow, ass low, ass low money pile overflow
Damn, baby got the fattest ass

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Problem]
Damn, damn, damn, Iggy, Iggy!
Do you see that ho?
That shit, that shit, that shit
Can't do that on Problem's stripper pole

They'll try and climb it if the giant
Little Snicker Bar diamonds, twinkle, twinkle Big Dipper
To all you little stars, it's me, Problem
Problem got some fun, got some change
Threw someone's golfer swing
Clubs and hoes think I'mma put a hole in one for real

Diamond [?] and brought drugs with me pills and that white girl
And I don't mean Iggy
I'm on a war path so the thing with me so you better run son
And I don't mean Diggy
Iggy I know you just got to this light
But that bitch right there so bad you should be bi for one night (at least)
