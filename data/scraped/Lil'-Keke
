"I got a pocket fulla stones"

[Lil Keke]
I'm draped up and dripped out
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Three in the mornin', gettin' the gat out the stash spot
Fire up a fat sweet
Turnin' on the bulb lights
Hand on the wood grain
Ass on the tight white
Showin' naked ass in the great state of Texas
Home of the players, so there'll never be no plexin'
So long we've been waitin'
Never ever hatin'
In Houston we Elbows, In Cali they Daytons
So 1996 you hoes better duck
Because the world gon' drip candy and be all Screwed Up
Just pop in your grey cassette
Turn up your fuckin' deck
Lend me your ear because the Southside finna wreck
Down here we smoke tree
Then let the world see
True hidden talent like Screw, and Lil Keke
Ain't no love for hatas and you busted big suckas
On the south side we stayin' paid MuthaFucka!

[DJ Screw]
Lil Keke gone and tell 'em what time it is...

[Lil Keke]
It's time to lay 'em down like a fresh set of dominoes
For all the playas, all the pimps, all the bitches, and all the hoes
Who's the man, who's the boss
Who's the nigga that's payed the cost
I really don't give a damn cause I ain't the one that's gonna take the loss
Grippin' a grand up in the slab, workin' the wood it's understood
Flippin these Rolls, and slammin' these doors
Pullin' these hoes and wearin' these clothes
Who in the the hell was able to tell the southside they had to chill
From hittin' tha boulevards from belts and buckles, woman and grill
I'm poppin' the trunk and smokin' a skunk and pullin' up candy red
Sittin' on bucks, not givin' a fuck and able to turn a head
Somethin' serious when I let go cause I got a way with words
I'm able to clown when using a noun to take the place of verbs
My lyrics go together like a pair of socks and shoes
My flow is slow because it's bolted down by DJ Screw
Take it from me, the nigga Lakee, the H, the A, the R and D
Menace to society
Born and raised to be a G
I grabs the 'phone go on and on
2 or 3 songs I won't postpone
Cause these lyrics comin' from the very top of my dome
So many ways it pays, If you can flip the script
By movin ya tongue, you take a dose and listen close, promise that you'll be sprung
Jacker's and hustler's, player's and mack's
Foreign doors and Cadillacs
Serve codeine that makes you lean and killer sweets rolled out the stacks
All these thangs remain tha same because I'm so able to win
All around just bow down
Because Lil Keke pimps tha penLove it man

I take my time and realize that this game is real
I got my mind on foreign, but I'm swanging bumpa grill
Gots to act real bad when I close red doors
I'm shootin spidas off my rims cuz I'm ridin on fours
And niggas don't understand that we be drinkin the norm
Never trust broads they're frauds
On the 'vard is where I sling when I claim my name
Back in the game Hershallwood, Texas regained
It's the nine-eight and I'm jumpin in the mix
Rocks up on my wrists and got haters on my list
How ya like me now cause I'm real

Gots to bring havoc let them boys have it
Fixin to wreck the mic now is that Fat Pat?

[Hook 2x]

[Fat Pat]
I'm so throwed in the game
Southside Playas, Screwed Up click mayne
Wit the Botany set you can bet them smoove as a 'vette
Comin through this motherfucker man, hold up and set
Some niggas catch me high like dat
And some niggas act like they wanna pull a gat
But they betta watch out for the boy P-A-T
Ask them motherfuckin haters can they handle me
Cause I be so throwed in this game
Comin down on the swing
Grip wood grain on the shirt I leave a stain
Cause you try to jack a real true G
Comin down the boulevard
Can they see me....swang and I swang and I swang to the left
Pop my trunk and dip dip dip
Niggas betta see a nigga roll
Starched down and I'm rollin on eighty fours
If the nigga FAT represent the click
Right up in the bowl and a whole lotta shit
Betta look around cause they don't understand it
I'mma say, "Hold up!" and scream, "God dammit!"
Cause I'mma let the gat gone grip and gone take a trip
And it's the empty clip just throw it off the ship
Cause it's a throwaway gat
It's that Fat Pat, where them haters at where them haterss at
Man love it man

I'ma, I'ma come through and show my wood pine

[Verse 1: Pimp C]
R.I.P. to Robert Davis, he the king of the south
Anything else said, need to shut your fucking mouth
I'm down with Lil' Flip, and I'm down with T.I.P
If them niggas come together, know how much paper we could see?
Slim Thug and Z-Ro, y'all still bullshitting
Need to sit down, take a tour, there's too much money to be get
Paul Wall and that Koopa still ain't talking
Money speak, all that bullshit keep walking
Y'all niggas got the game fucked up
All you record company people need to shut the fuck up
Cause y'all keeping up that bullshit rapping
The white people laughing at 'em, that's what's happening
The same stupid ass niggas still ain't figured it out
Long as they stay divided, man we gon' run the south
Y'all need to get up out the dumb shit
I got a bread truck, get up out that crumb shit, nigga

[Hook x2: Pimp C]

[Verse 2: P.O.P.]
Hey, I got the bass quaking, trunk shaking like tambourines
In the H, where them paints sweet as tangerines
Where they bouncing on fours like trampolines
It's the great state of Texas so I can't believe
All the conflict and plex that we carrying
It's time to get rid of the beef like vegetarians
I'm 'bout stacking bank, everyday
So I pay attention to the vets and I ain't talking 'bout a Chevrolet
Keke the Don, Pimp C a king
Lil' J, the owner of the squad, H-Town, we the team
It ain't no I in that, you trying that, you be fatigued
But if we man up and press, we could lead the league
We some all-stars, the roster is sick, man
I ain't gotta start, P.O.P.'ll be the sixth man
Rap-A-Lot's a southern empire for the assist, man
Three, two, one, swish, and

[Hook x2: Pimp C]

[Verse 3: Lil' Keke]
You see the slab outside, it look good, don't it?
Masterpiece, dripped out, with the fours on it
Trunk airtight, speakers and them show lights
Holding, cops around, nigga get your shit tight
Let me tell you the meaning of coming through
When the seats off-cream and the candy is dark blue
Approaching downtown, knocking doors down
Tint eleven slabs in a single-file line
Flossing, swerving, the rims is glistening
They gotta see the wood cause the top is missing
I sleep on dreams cause it's paper I'm chasing
My roots come from Texas, this Pimpalation
The barre is tasty, the Benz is spacey
I gotta show my class so these haters can face me
Riding up the boulevard, crushing the sidewalk
Showing my surround while I'm knocking the doors off

[Hook x2: Pimp C][Verse 1: Slim Thug]
Now welcome to the city of game, piece of chains and swangs
Pop, trunk and bang, yeah I'm still here mayne
Born and raised on the stead block, braids no dreadlocks
Married to the hood, me and Scenic Woods wedlock
Acres Homes my home, I'm a Northside veteran
Repping H-Town, smoking, sipping on some medicine
Ain't nobody better than the boss when I floss
It's Slim Thugga motherfucker, still breaking boys off

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
Got plenty cheese plenty carats, man we looking like some caterers
And its looking like you haters and you fakes is imitating us
Shaded up, braided up, and I bet that trunk be bladed up
Bentley still crawling on fo's so they ain't fading us
In the hood I'm a grinder, wood on the vinyl
TV, VCR, I'm laid back with your mama
You ain't never seen a grinder that grind the way I grind, huh?
Top of my drop still missin' as Osama

[Hook: Chamillionaire]
(Still breaking boys off, hmm) Candy painted with the gloss
You can hate but that's the way a player floss
(Still breaking boys off, hmm) Getting money's what I'm bout
I'ma get it while these haters just talk
(Still breaking boys off, hmm) Gotta do it for the north
Gotta do it for my hustlers in the south
(Still breaking boys off, boys off, still breaking boys off)
And when I do it I'ma do it like a boss (still breaking boys off)

[Verse 3: Mike Jones]
I still represent H-Town, the city of that candy
They see me with a lotta cars but they don't understand it
They say the never seen ya boy out here gettin his grind on
Phantom, Bentley, take ya pick, yeah I'm gettin' my shine on
I've sold 2 million records now my paper all swole now
The mayor of the city, top down when I roll now
H-town, home of the candy paint
Home of the 84's and vogues and the purple drank

[Verse 4: Bun B]
Yeh this the city thats slow, the city thats thowed
The city where the boys flip the candy painted low
The city where they blow big killa and stayed blowed
Hustling ass D-boys got the game sewed
And sip that paint (sip that paint) and drip that paint (drip that paint)
And drop that top (drop that top) and grip that grain (hold up)
6-10, I-10, 59, 45, and da belt
This Clutch City but we play what we delt
Reppin the H-Town

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Paul Wall]
Hustle town's my home, it's where I do my dirt
Where the gangtstas smoke water with drank stains on they shirt
We ride swangin', chops blades just to break boys off
From South Park to the Southwest and all the way to that north
I'm talking Tidwell and Carverdale and Greenspoint too
From Denver Harbor to West Airport and all the way to Channelview
We steady bangin on this screw, it's chopping like kung fu
Hit me on the 8-3-2, it's Paul Wall wat it do baby

[Verse 6: Yung Redd]
(Heheh, nahmtawkinbout?)
Purple so muddy I can barely even drive
Stay blowin down trees like a Category 5
Southside of H-Town the heart of Sunny Side
I could walk these streets if I was blind, nahmtawkinbout?
Yung Reedd, take ya out the future
Stars imitate swear to God I was a jewler
Robert Davis, Fat Pat, this for you
To my homie Big Hawk, I salute
MAYNE!!!

[Hook]

[Verse 7: Lil Keke]
H-O to the U-S, T-O to the N
God blessed me with the million dollar pen
See them quiet money gangstas with they hand in the air
That Sunny Side and South Park, I was raised out there
This is H-Town (H-Town), screwed up and slowed down
It's all love homie, keep rolling up the whole pound
Pull up in the monster just look at him hiding
Don Ke' heart of the south, slab riding

[Verse 8: Z-Ro]
H-O-U-S-T-O-N, T-E-X-A-S
We go get it and come back with it until we take our last breath
From the city where our stadiums drop the top
Z-Ro the Crooked, my ghetto pass is good in any hood, any block they got
The white cup is for the codeine and the cigarillo is for the kush
If you want it we got it cause there's not a product we dont push
We used to be the dirty south, now we so dirty we filthy
So homie you must be touching it wrong if you don't feel me (you don't feel me)

[Hook]

[Verse 9: Mike D]
Welcome to H-Town, this 3rd Ward talking
Coming down the slab line the fo's crip walking
Together we stand, divided we fall, yeah

Fuck that, nigga its a H-Town thang
Lemme see ya touch the sky if ya feeling me mayne
Its Boss Hogg Corleone, nigga that Mike D
The drank man daddy, you know where to find me

[Verse 10: Big Pokey]
State to state dawg, I got em jockin the kid
6' backin out the driveway, dropping the wig
Yall know we do it big, like a freightliner rig
Got stashes full of cash where I keep the money hid
Fresh to death homie, how I came in the do'
Prada shades on, smelling like a swanger of dro
Put'cha H'es up, represent'cha city bro
Counting money, iced out, like I'm in a video

[Hook]

[Verse 11: Rob G]
(Talking) Southwest put'cha dubs up baby, let's go!
Now welcome to the place I love, place I was raised to be a G
It's straight hang with thugs, jam my music slow and hold my H's up
Southwest SWAT I know the real dudes that move birdies
I go to school early, baby blue Moon jersey
Riding around, southwest side of my towm
Still Reppin' My Block, How Ya Likin Me Now
Its from Sharpstown, Braeswood to Alief
Black and Latins stacking paper together we stay deep
It's Rob G!

[Verse 12: Trae]
Cheyah!
King of the Streets and I'm roll around Houston ridin 4's
Boys better chill 'fore this throw-away leave they curtains closed (lights out)
I'm in the slab but I'm tippin it like a platinum Rolls
Suicide make the door presidential when they decide to close (real talk)
They want the throne but tell the haters that I got it locked (got it locked)
I shoot em on the west so whatever all they way to the block (doors up)
I'm so hood it be the true definition of me
Ain't no way speak about the H, without mentioning me
Tha Truth, nigga!

[Hook]

[Verse 13: Lil O]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Ay I'm from H-Town, southwest stop drop and roll

Braaeswood, Woolfair, Clull Creek, Spice Lane
West Bellville, Fondren Airport, Sandpiper, stack change
I'm so H-Town there's codeine in my blood
And I done shout it out at war with with the meanest of thugs
And you ain't never gotta ask if there's lean in my cup
I'm a triple O.G., S.U.C. nigga what
Its Lil O Homie

[Verse 14: Pimp C]
Now I'm from Port Arthur, Texas, 90 miles away
For the last 15 years, I been reppin my state
I knew the real DJ Screw sip grape by the case
Eight's over ice straight product of the H
Southside, I never was no big socializer
With Bun you can talk, I fuck with the boss
Like Thug and Prince Silvia Rome or Wrice
This game a pie I dont want it all I just need a slice

[Hook][Hook: Lil Keke]
I chunk up the deuce for the south and the north
Boys talking down and boys wanna hate
I chunk up the deuce for the south and the north
Boys talking down, don't make me pull out the choppa
I chunk up the deuce for the south and the north
Boys talking down, I'll leave 'em on the streets dead
I chunk up the deuce for the south and the north
Boys talking down, I got them diamonds in my mouth

[Verse 1: Paul Wall]
Well it's that grain gripper from Houston, Tex
That barre sipper, that barre, no plex
I'm straight up outta that Swishahouse, where G. Dash write all the checks
So check the neck, check the wrist, I'm balla status from head to toe
My jewelry shop sell more grills than George Foreman, baby now you know
That ain't a igloo, that's my watch, and that ain't snow, baby that's my chain
That's not a ice tray, that's my teeth, and that's not a snow cone, that's my ring
That ain't Kool-Aid up in my cup, I stay sipping that purple oil
I stay flipping the slab on fours, cause I'm a hustler 'til I'm in the soil
My wrist game is one of a kind, Patek Philippe worth a 100K
My work schedule out on the block, it's mash all night and grind all day
No 401K for a hustler, just bleed the block and stack that paper
M.O.B. when it comes to hoes and a .40 cal when it comes to haters
We authentic playas not counterfeit, got a 600 Benz with a fog kit
Got hoes at the HK turning tricks, outrunning the track, trying to make me rich
I'm too legit to quit, stacking up that paper 'til I'm gone
So I'ma be working wood wheel and catching splinters
Riding twenty inches or better in chrome

[Hook: Lil Keke]

[Verse 2: Lil Keke]
Don Ke
Houston, Tex, got the streets burning, popping seals with them fours turning
Rookie boys, they still learning, losing cash, I'm still earning
Get my bread when I shake the fed, keep them dimes in and out my bed
Jump in the drop to convert the top and let 'em bop on candy red
Leather seats with that wood out, they don't know what my hood 'bout
Tryna take the young don's spot, I'm platinum balling and still hot
Haters off in my mix again, pimping broads plus pimping pens
Multiplying, I gotta win, keep that ice looking clear as gin
Out the roof still chunking deuce, riding slab and hopping juice
Diamond grill with plenty of skills, just pass the mic and I let it loose
Independent still chasing bucks, 22s on Porsche trucks
Model chicks with them big ol' butts, killer clans with them big ol' nuts
Hit the club with my game tight, hoes bopping my fame right
Did her thang the same night, boys talking, it's all hype
Cut the check when I run my mouth, rolling in green like I'm playing golf
Texas boys be going off, representing the north and south

[Hook: Lil Keke]

[Verse 3: Pimp C and Bun B]
I'm from Port Arthur, Texas, represent it 'til I'm dead
Pimping almost died in the 80s, boys was scared
Bitches was on crack, and the 'Lac wasn't rolling
But the game done been revived cause now the south side is holding
Pockets stay swollen, what do we do with all this cash?
Drive '84 Biarritz with TVs jumpin up out the dash
Pistol in the stash even though I'm on parole
Nigga try me with that fuck it, bitch I'll leave your body cold
From the land of grain, dripping paint, 84s and a chrome grill
This Texas baby, dirty south, P.A.T., you know we real
We pack the Ks, Desert Eags, ARs and them 38s
We serving nothing but Chyna Whyte, playa we don't sell that dirty weight
Big Bun Beeda, hold it down, rep the town to the fullest
Whether it be on the mic or in the streets busting them bullets
Don't put it with me, I won't pull it on you and leave you ventilated
UGK is back on the block and you marks is finna hate it

[Hook: Lil Keke][Intro: Lil Keke]
Yeah, H-Town all stars in the building, that's right
Lil Keke the don, yes
Check it out

[Verse 1: Lil Keke]
Seven-thirteen homey, I been on
Yeah we been here and y'all sho been gone
Screwed up captain, still repping the south
And can't none of y'all cut me off, I'm alive
Make 'em southside, cause that's Texas pride
Pimp C got me swangin' it wide, so be quiet
Bey still repping it right for H-Town
Don Keke's draped up, chopped and screwed down

[Verse 2: Slim Thug]
I've been on, I've been on
Since back when I had braids on my dome
Underground king, sitting on my throne
Me and Bey done did number one songs
Riding candy and chrome, this Texas
Could buy a Bentley cash with this necklace
This H-Town, we drive reckless
We make 'em bow down, they gon' respect us

[Hook x2: Beyoncé]
I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me who gon take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off

[Verse 3: Willie D]
I am Houston, rep it hard
Cup with R, candy cars
Geto Boys, Willie D
You're plexing with Bey, you're plexing with me
These dudes in the streets, be acting mob
But go to the pen, and be playing with them boys
They are not me, they're carbon copies
If God got me, who gon' stop me

[Verse 4: Scarface]
I been on, now who you goons gon' get to knock me off?
I've been boss, been on slabs, been on paint
Been on fours homey, I've been on drank, I've been had bank
Twenty-five years and ain't fell off yet, cause my flow that wet
You don't want no plex, they talk that sh-
The Queen Bey said you better bow down, bow down

[Hook x2: Beyoncé]

[Verse 5: Z-Ro]
On, I could never be off
Hit the boulevard so hard, it'd never be soft
Yellow bone so long, looking like they reach out
Set of diamonds and gold in damn near each mouth
They call it Styrofoam City; Houston, Texas to be exact
Swangas on anything, it ain't gotta be a Lac
If I say I got sixteen, it ain't gotta be a rap
All them d-boys in them traps, they gotta feel that

[Verse 6: Bun B]
We the big ballers and big bodies in fresh foreigners
Fresh up off the road from hustling and rap touring
While you sleeping and snoring, we creeping and pouring
BaddieBey and the Bun, baby, you can't ignore 'em
Represent for Port Arthur, get it right off the water
How you want it hard or soft, put in your order
Never the hesitators, shaking off all the haters
Ridin' for Pimp, Screw and all the Lone Star Staters, hol' up

[Hook: Beyoncé]

[Outro: Beyoncé]
I remember my baby hair with my dookie braids
Frenchy’s, Boudin in the parking lot

Draped up and dripped out, know what I'm talking bout (x4)

[Bun B]
Well it's big Bun B now, baby, Mr. Woodgrain
With diamonds up against them balling through your hood mayn
And I'm smoking on some good mayn, the color purple
Not the movie, but the kind that have you going in a circle
Chrome, looking more classy than the Transco Tower
Car drippin' candy paint like it just came out the shower
Like 'Face I got the money, the power and the finesse
To roll around one deep with hundred-thousand round my neck
I'm looking real shiny; you can see me from a mile away
Thought you was doing it, until I came and took your smile away
Pull up on your side in the turning lane
Pop my trunk, break you off, chunk a deuce
And I'm Cadillac turning mayn (I'm gone)
Little swang to the left, big swang to the right
My plates scraping and I'm sliding the pipe, it's super tight
So don't try to knock us baby, don't try to hate
That's how we do it in that Lone star state; get it straight
(We be...)

[Hook x2]

[Bun B]
Now if you never been to Texas, there's a picture to paint
Cause we doing it real big, in case you thinking we ain't
It's lots of money on these streets, being spent and being made
All it take is one look to see these boys getting paid
They living laid in big houses, with pools in the backyard
Certified gangsters so you never see us act fraud
With iced out watches, bracelets, chains
Pieces, teeth, mayn we throwed in the game
We got screens in that headrest, visors in the ceiling
On chrome 83's and fours and Vogue peeling
With bumpers and belts across the back of my trunk
Push a button, and my car is waiving bye to you punk
We from the land of sippin' on syrup and (banging the Screw)
We slab swangin' comin down and through, I thought you knew
Back in the days, all they ever did was doubt us
Now the South is in the house, and they can't do nothing about us
(We be...)

[Hook x2]

[Bun B]
One time for my trill niggas reppin the block
The real soldiers on the frontline is keeping it cocked
They hold it down for they hood, throw it up, let 'em see it
So they can know how you G it, if they hating, so be it
We ain't playing where I'm staying cause it's way too real
No matter the situation, we gotta keep it trill
Got the steel on my side when I ride cause I'm ready
I got 20/10 vision and my trigger finger steady
I'm an Underground King homeboy, and not a simp
And I gots to represent 'til they decide to free the Pimp
I'm down for my click, just like I'm down for my block
And I'm a stand up for my partner 'til they let him off of lock
So go on, body rock, Southside or lean back
Two-step with your boy if you about your greenbacks
This here is a Texas toast so raise your glass
Because the whole dirty South fittin' to show they naked ass
(We be...)

We got the drank the dro, plus the alcohol
For my people who be ready to ball, come on
Let's hit the flo' and let it go, 'fore I start the show
Get your back up off the wall, come on
Start club hopping, in the city where it's popping
A lot of bodies rocking, a lot of women flocking
Trying to kick it, they rolling with the niggas with the tickets
I make my cash flow, jump up a whole digit
Look at me, I graduated a G
Now put your hands in the air, so the crowd can see

[Hook]
(you feeling good), then body rock with me
Go on represent your hood, and body rock with me
All the independent women, come and rock with me
Get your hands up high, so the crowd can see

Coming straight up off the streets, it ain't no stopping Ke'
Real G's, body rock with me
Put your sets in the air, so the crowd can see

[Devin the Dude]
And that's the only way to do it round here, is to have fun
Some niggas got drank some got sweets, some have blunts
And yep I'm one of the ones, my lungs hold tons of weed
Smoking with niggas like Snoop, Ke', Bun B
Yukmouth, D'Angelo there's more on the menu
I can keep naming people, but I'm not fin to
Cause I'm here to have a good time, body rock
I'll probably hop out on the flo', just to let you hoes know
That I can go way back, cabbage patch bitch what
I bust a windmill, backspin then get up
Start body rocking again, side to side hop and spin
That move didn't get no pussy from you, but it got your friend
Out here dancing, with her hands in the air
Waving em, like she just don't care
Yeah letting the crowd see, letting herself be free
Letting her body rock, with me

[Hook]

[Lil' Keke]
Here comes the go-getter, yeah the quick lick hitter
The dope rhyme spitter, you wanna take a picture
Let me hit ya, sky page two way style
I'm a gangsta, that's trying to keep a low profile
With a pen and a paper, trying to pull a caper
Me and Mr. Lee, and a nice big plate of
Beats, so we keep on crushing the streets
Laid up in some'ing lovely, in a first class suite
Trying to smoke a fat sack, body rock and all that
Alert the Nextel walkie talkie, get right back
I give it to em, and at the same time do em
I mix em slow em down, so that means I'm trying to screw em
So it's lights out, baby what you tal'n bout
Bout to turn out the party, get it crunk no doubt
All the independent women, go on shake it to death
Get your hands in the sky, if you feeling yourself uh

(*talking*)
You feeling good, say man check it out
Down here in Texas, well better yet the Dirty South
We like to say[Hook]
I'mma break 'em off real bad
I'mma show 'em pourin' up a duece and ridin' slab...

[Verse 1: Paul Wall]
Now I gotta work my woodgrain wheel
Poppin' trunks, poppin' pills, still poppin' seals
Higher than a hill with my mind on mill
Piece and chain swangin', bankroll, shiny grill
Baby I got million dollar dreams with my mind on cream
I'm in that mean green machine; clean, on 19s
Flatscreens in the headrest, swingin' like a swingset
Brandywine paint wet, comin' down, that's a bet
I'm in the lot chasin' broads like a lesbian
Full of that kush-flower, I'm breakin' off pedestrians
Higher than a streetlight, floatin' like a parachute
Buzzin' like a bumblebee, mustard-green Bentley coupe
Young gangsta mack game sharper than a thumbtack
Breakin' 'em off, makin' all the boppers attract
Then they watch me, I'm rocked up, fully loaded and sloppy
Tryna hit it and quit it and walk off like Big Papi
Break 'em off

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil' Keke]
Aye, aye
I pull up like this, untouchable white wrist
I'm hotter than warm piss, berry grape Sunkist
The truck gold mist 550 snow bunny
Bentley Continental with the mink floors dummy
Paul Wall money, that's expensive taste
And them friendly ass fools we send 'em to MySpace
I'mma break 'em off until the backbone broken
Stainless steel drop Phantom, leave the top open
Shit done hit the fan, better cover your nose
And the kush done start burnin', better cover your clothes
(that's right)
Concrete crumblin', glass shootin' lasers
Crawlin' and cuttin' up on 24 razors
I'mma show 'em how to make the slab look phenomenal
Chasin' paper in the mornin', call me Houston Chronicle
Hold on, then you buckle up the seat belt
SwishaHouse, Young Don, capital TF

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Paul Wall]
Already
I'm higher than a satellite, crawlin' like a baby
Maneuvering through the traffic like I'm Tracy McGrady
Still choppin' on them buttons, I'm struttin' and lookin' fresh
Switch hittin' like Berkman, this is ballin' at its best
In that Minute Maid dropper with retractable roof
Finer than wood, wavin' the hood, student loans on the tooth
The fifth wheel on the ground
And the trunk in the air
Paul Wall, baby I'm the definition of playa
My skills is so ill when workin' that wood wheel
Tippin' 4s like a waiter, beware of the oil spill
Widescreen mindframe, panoramic pimpin'
I'm sippin' on that Osama, baby, leanin' like I'm limpin'
In that two-seater feeder, it's me and a señorita
Three ounces up in the liter
And it's ten up in the heater
Mackin' a mamacita
Runnin' game like a cheetah
I'm knockin' 'em out the park similar to Derek Jeter
Break 'em off

[Hook][Hook: Lil Keke]
I chunk up the deuce for the south and the north
Boys talking down and boys wanna hate
I chunk up the deuce for the south and the north
Boys talking down, don't make me pull out the choppa
I chunk up the deuce for the south and the north
Boys talking down, I'll leave 'em on the streets dead
I chunk up the deuce for the south and the north
Boys talking down, I got them diamonds in my mouth

[Verse 1: Paul Wall]
Well it's that grain gripper from Houston, Tex
That barre sipper, that barre, no plex
I'm straight up outta that Swishahouse, where G. Dash write all the checks
So check the neck, check the wrist, I'm balla status from head to toe
My jewelry shop sell more grills than George Foreman, baby now you know
That ain't a igloo, that's my watch, and that ain't snow, baby that's my chain
That's not a ice tray, that's my teeth, and that's not a snow cone, that's my ring
That ain't Kool-Aid up in my cup, I stay sipping that purple oil
I stay flipping the slab on fours, cause I'm a hustler 'til I'm in the soil
My wrist game is one of a kind, Patek Philippe worth a 100K
My work schedule out on the block, it's mash all night and grind all day
No 401K for a hustler, just bleed the block and stack that paper
M.O.B. when it comes to hoes and a .40 cal when it comes to haters
We authentic playas not counterfeit, got a 600 Benz with a fog kit
Got hoes at the HK turning tricks, outrunning the track, trying to make me rich
I'm too legit to quit, stacking up that paper 'til I'm gone
So I'ma be working wood wheel and catching splinters
Riding twenty inches or better in chrome

[Hook: Lil Keke]

[Verse 2: Lil Keke]
Don Ke
Houston, Tex, got the streets burning, popping seals with them fours turning
Rookie boys, they still learning, losing cash, I'm still earning
Get my bread when I shake the fed, keep them dimes in and out my bed
Jump in the drop to convert the top and let 'em bop on candy red
Leather seats with that wood out, they don't know what my hood 'bout
Tryna take the young don's spot, I'm platinum balling and still hot
Haters off in my mix again, pimping broads plus pimping pens
Multiplying, I gotta win, keep that ice looking clear as gin
Out the roof still chunking deuce, riding slab and hopping juice
Diamond grill with plenty of skills, just pass the mic and I let it loose
Independent still chasing bucks, 22s on Porsche trucks
Model chicks with them big ol' butts, killer clans with them big ol' nuts
Hit the club with my game tight, hoes bopping my fame right
Did her thang the same night, boys talking, it's all hype
Cut the check when I run my mouth, rolling in green like I'm playing golf
Texas boys be going off, representing the north and south

[Hook: Lil Keke]

[Verse 3: Pimp C and Bun B]
I'm from Port Arthur, Texas, represent it 'til I'm dead
Pimping almost died in the 80s, boys was scared
Bitches was on crack, and the 'Lac wasn't rolling
But the game done been revived cause now the south side is holding
Pockets stay swollen, what do we do with all this cash?
Drive '84 Biarritz with TVs jumpin up out the dash
Pistol in the stash even though I'm on parole
Nigga try me with that fuck it, bitch I'll leave your body cold
From the land of grain, dripping paint, 84s and a chrome grill
This Texas baby, dirty south, P.A.T., you know we real
We pack the Ks, Desert Eags, ARs and them 38s
We serving nothing but Chyna Whyte, playa we don't sell that dirty weight
Big Bun Beeda, hold it down, rep the town to the fullest
Whether it be on the mic or in the streets busting them bullets
Don't put it with me, I won't pull it on you and leave you ventilated
UGK is back on the block and you marks is finna hate it

[Hook: Lil Keke][Intro: Lil' Keke]
Big terrible Texas, where legends are born
Lil Keke the don, original Screwed Up Click
This dedicated to DJ Screw, Fat Pat, Big Mellow, Big Steve

[Hook: Lil' Keke]
Draped up and dripped out, know what I'm talking bout (x4)

[Bun B]
Well it's big Bun B now, baby, Mr. Woodgrain
With diamonds up against them balling through your hood mayn
And I'm smoking on some good mayn, the color purple
Not the movie, but the kind that have you going in a circle
Chrome, looking more classy than the Transco Tower
Car drippin' candy paint like it just came out the shower
Like 'Face I got the money, the power and the finesse
To roll around one deep with hundred-thousand round my neck
I'm looking real shiny; you can see me from a mile away
Thought you was doing it, until I came and took your smile away
Pull up on your side in the turning lane
Pop my trunk, break you off, chunk a deuce
And I'm Cadillac turning mayn (I'm gone)
Little swang to the left, big swang to the right
My plates scraping and I'm sliding the pipe, it's super tight
So don't try to knock us baby, don't try to hate
That's how we do it in that Lone star state; get it straight
(We be...)

[Hook x2]

[Bun B]
Now if you never been to Texas, there's a picture to paint
Cause we doing it real big, in case you thinking we ain't
It's lots of money on these streets, being spent and being made
All it take is one look to see these boys getting paid
They living laid in big houses, with pools in the backyard
Certified gangsters so you never see us act fraud
With iced out watches, bracelets, chains
Pieces, teeth, mayn we throwed in the game
We got screens in that headrest, visors in the ceiling
On chrome 83's and fours and Vogue peeling
With bumpers and belts across the back of my trunk
Push a button, and my car is waiving bye to you punk
We from the land of sippin' on syrup and (banging the Screw)
We slab swangin' comin down and through, I thought you knew
Back in the days, all they ever did was doubt us
Now the South is in the house, and they can't do nothing about us
(We be...)

[Hook x2]

[Bun B]
One time for my trill niggas reppin the block
The real soldiers on the frontline is keeping it cocked
They hold it down for they hood, throw it up, let 'em see it
So they can know how you G it, if they hating, so be it
We ain't playing where I'm staying cause it's way too real
No matter the situation, we gotta keep it trill
Got the steel on my side when I ride cause I'm ready
I got 20/10 vision and my trigger finger steady
I'm an Underground King homeboy, and not a simp
And I gots to represent 'til they decide to free the Pimp
I'm down for my click, just like I'm down for my block
And I'm a stand up for my partner 'til they let him off of lock
So go on, body rock, Southside or lean back
Two-step with your boy if you about your greenbacks
This here is a Texas toast so raise your glass
Because the whole dirty South fittin' to show they naked ass
(We be...)

[Hook x2][Intro: Lil' Keke]
Big terrible Texas
It's where legends are born
I'm Lil' Keke The Don
Original Screwed Up Click
It's a dedication to DJ Screw
Fat Pat, Big Mello, Big Steve
Feel it?

[Hook: Lil Keke]
Draped up and dripped out, know what I'm talking about (x4)

[Verse 1: Lil' Keke]
I'm draped up and dripped out, the truth has just slipped out
84's, red doors, candy apple flip-flop
Got them boppers dripped out cause my drop tip top
Purple cup, screw us up, that's what keep the streets hot
Don P, Bun B, please free Pimp C
Hydro, Super Flow, know these boys feeling me
Come to Houston, Texas and see swangaz and 'lacs
And don't forget to tell the people that the legends are back
Yeah

[Verse 2: Slim Thug]
It's Slim Thug showing H-Town love
Used to hit the club on dubs, acting bad on scrubs
Mad spokes and leather, 24's or better
Boys say they riding candy but my load is wetter
The roads for competitors when they see the two letters
They'll never ever ever ever ever get on my level
Me and Bun together caked up with clout
Staying draped up and dripped out, know what I'm talking about?

[Verse 3: Chamillionaire]
The city is back, just look at the map
Thought we wouldn't get in the game
I'm sticking my dick up in the game and bustin' in that like a train
I'm hitting that mayne
Look at this grain I'm grippin', I'm fixing to swang
My bumper doing the body rock and my trunk is doing the crane
Now who in the hell was able to tell the world it wasn't my bang
I turn up the beat and I'm cracking the street
The city we started to train
The world is looking like Texas mayne
Just watch how they pick up the slang
Just show 'em your grill
And pick up some drank and watch how they do the same
Hold up mayne

[Verse 4: Paul Wall]
What it do baby? It's Paul Wall
Players rise while haters fall
Got fo's crawling in the 54
On the service road, I'm obeying the laws
I stay shining like headlights
And I stay crawling like head lice
Just like a boy but I play the dice
Them twos and threes ain't nuttin' nice
Them threes and fours I'mma roll fo' sho
Fo's and vogues, we call 'em swang
My partner Bun B bring the pain
Wanna know what I rep? Just check the chain
In the hood is where I hang, on South Lee, that 5-9
He dippin' oil, he drippin' candy
From P-A to H-Town, it goes down

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Mike Jones]
Ice Age, Mike Jones
I stay draped up, dripped out, drop the top when I'm flipping out
Candy low on 84 (how you know they fo's?) They poking out
Ice Age and Rap-A-Lot, pimping hoes in the parking lot
Diamonds shining in my grill, you can see 'em if its dark or not
When I'm out in the limelight
I make sure I shine bright
I'm in the drop with the Glock cocked
You know I keep that iron tight
I'm getting brain from a tight dame
On North Maine in the turning lane
I'm young and rich talking a lot of shit
I guess its because I'm having thangs

[Verse 6: Aztek]
I'm still draped up and dripped out, know what I'm talking bout
Fighting over parking spots, bustin' in the parking lot
Tu sabes, vatos, ves no fakos, parse
Te mato sin ningun contrato vamos
Now put your blocks up, now put your sets up
Fuck that nigga over there cause I think he said something
Have to take 'em with a clip out with the click out
Don't give a shit bout
'Till he gets out, free Pimp C, we draped up and dripped out

[Verse 7: Lil' Flip]
I told Bun when you need a verse, just holla
You know how we do it, you ain't gotta spend no dollars
I'm puffin dro, bangin' screw, and riding fo's
Middle fingers in the air, you know how it goes
Stash spot with weight in it, Candy paint with flakes in it
Trunk got the bass in it, One liter with eights in it
Swisha sweet with haze in it, you know I'm blowed
Four row diamond chain, you know I'm pro
Johnny got me right huh? 80 carats, bright huh?
Hit the button, pop the trunk, watch the neon light jump
I'mma keep folding bread 'till Pimp hold his head
We miss you DJ Screw, man I hate you dead

[Verse 8: Z-Ro]
Down to ride red but I'mma ride blue
In the turning lane looking just like Screw
300 Crissy, don't think they doors
Everybody know Z-Ro's flow is ferocious
I keep a Robert Davis in the deck
Might be deep 22 drank in the whip
You can keep the sherm but you can pass the cup
My Cadillac rolling on glass and wood
Would I knock a jacka down when his ass get up?
Hell naw, this is playa from the chest to the nut
Screw was here he said I would come up
Now the radio requesting my stuff
Gotta keep a Smith-n-Wesson in buss
Cause the better life keep me stressing enough
Is this rap for real, is it a blessing or what?
Screw I hope I see you when they wet me up

[Verse 9: Bun B]
This is H-Town, Texas, tell me how does it look?
Taking over the rap kitchen and we ready to cook
You can hear us whipping the beakers coming out of the speakers
Chef-ing up some fresh hard for you out of town geekers
We got 3rd Ward, 4th Ward, and Southside G's
Plus Southwest and Bloody Nickels rollin' 83's
It's Houston, Texas motherfucker, you know the name
We'll see you in February for the All-Star Game

Ask the streets, I'm still the best-this whole state it belong to Ke

[Hook Till End](*talking*)
One time, welcome to the ghetto

[Hook]
All I know is hustling, and striving and feeling pain
Each and everyday, I'm surviving stuck in the game
Gotta get this money, this cash that's all I know
Done came a long way, but got far to go

[Lil' Keke]
Alright just check it out, I know I'm living a life of sin
A thug coming up, trying to find a way to win
I'm on my knees, asking the Lord to give me help
I'm trying to make a difference, doing bad for myself
I'm on a bumpy road, so that's all I really know
Trying to slide through the do', but the money coming slow
I hustle up, and try to get some recognition
Steady searching for my soul, trying to stay up out the kitchen
This rap game, got my head leaning back
Got my family at the house, so I'm trying to make a stack
In a dirty world, but I'm trying to make a switch
But the game crawling up, it's so hard to get rich
I'm concentrating, trying to stash what I got
Record company CEO's, all these boys trying to plot
Trying to hold me a spot, trying to get me some fame
Got love for the pain, that I get from the game uh

[Hook - 2x]

[Lil' Keke]
I know I'm right there, so I'm working a lil' harder
Doing show after show, trying to stay above water
CD's got me grinding, the mic got me shining
Paying attention close, to the charts I'm climbing
I'm a hustler, really trying to get it how I live
Staying in battle mode, cause it's real in the field
I'm a soldier, fighting against the game I love
From the tears to the sweat, on down to the blood
Gotta get mine, with no time to rewind
These niggas be left behind, out here losing they mind
But I'm trying to find, another life other than grind
Niggas be giving up, but I'm steady putting it down
So I changed up, now I'm Lil' Keke the Don
Doing hits across the world, with that Poetic 1
We some trend setters, with these haters to blame
I ain't gon never give it up man, I love this game uh

[Hook - 2x]

[Lil' Keke]
I say never say never, a part of the G code
Drinking on that drank, I'm smoking and staying blowed
Whatever it takes, to put my mind at ease
I need the moola the cash, gotta have that cheese
A lot of bad habits, got me working overtime
Constantly trying to shine, got a nigga left behind
The repercussions, will make a gangsta change
Keep my head to the sky, cause I love this game uh

[Hook - 2x](*Shima singing*)

[Hook: Shima]
High come down
Why do you make my high, come down

[Lil' Keke]
Put the Crys on ice, let the lights dim bright
Put your best dress on, cause we fucking tonight
Lay your hair down, cause you a beautiful star
Got the laced thong on, with the matching bra
Had a sip of hypnotic, now you feeling erotic
Wanna get up under me, and start touching your body
I make your high come down, up and down
Give me some leeway, head on the freeway
Slide the roof back, put the square in the air
Damn you looking good, with everything you wear
You my sugar brown round mound, you take it downtown
Everywhere we go, for real it's going down
I'm the young Don, you got it tatted on your back
Love the way I hit it, from the back in the Lac
Like that, round and round to H-Town
I know what to do, to make your high come down, come on

[Hook: Shima]
High come down
Why do you make my high, come down
High come down
Tell me why do you make my high, come down

[Lil' Keke]
I can't wait to hit the interstate, doing 150
Throw the weed out, 'fore the law come get me
I'm on my way, to the place you stay
And don't worry bout the Benz, cause it's a-ok
I'm in a drop top 5, put it in six
Buckle up your belt, we gon scratch to the mix
You're my boo it's true, you make my high come through
Gon jump in the hot tub, do what you do
Cause tonight's your night, and tomorrow's your day
I'mma hit the hot spot, with no time to play
In the Lex-O, and your homegirl's hating
Stop at the light, 22's rotating
Call up the cellular, business on the regular
First class strips, if I wanna get next to you
Oakland, on back to H-Town
And I got what it takes, to make you come down, come on

[Hook: Shima]

[Lil' Keke]
Ok let's do it again, before the sun rise
Come over and let me touch up, on your thick thighs
Let me squeeze your chest, let me caress your breast
We can see the whole world baby, east to west
Well yeah don't forget, I'm a thug nigga
Undercover low key, I'm a mob figga
But let me take you to the zone, going one on one
We getting mesmerized, we going half on the sun
Catch you on the weekend, and we freaking
But I see you next week, and we probably not speaking
Playas, you know we play that way
But I'mma ride off baby, it's a beautiful day
On the low-low, we smoking do-do

Say I see you next time, when I'm back in town
Best believe, I'mma make your high come down, what

[Hook - 2x]
Hustle and hustle, till you can't no mo' (uh huh)

Hustle and hustle, till you can't no mo' (uh huh)
Hustle and hustle, till you can't no mo' (be safe in these streets)

[Lil' Head]
Whether it's nine to five, or either selling dope
You gotta get it how you live, just to stay afloat
By any means necessary, bitch get on your grind
Broke shit is punk shit, man it ain't lying
I been there I'm still here, and I'm trying to get out
And all my real niggas know, what I'm talking about
And street life, make a nigga not eat right
Losing sleep, and why you trying to stay up on feet right
Been in the game, for a real long time
I can't believe you motherfuckers, ain't respecting my rhyme
Can't believe you motherfuckers, ain't respecting mind
The year 0-4, I know you gon respect it this time
Cause I'm talking bout the real shit, I know you gonna feel this
Down South nigga, nope I ain't from the hills bitch
I'm from a place, where niggas the yellow
And yeah I'm from the Clarke, but I'm still stuck in the ghetto so I

[Hook - 2x]

[H.A.W.K.]
I hustle and hustle and, struggle and struggle and
Juggle and double and, stay out of trouble man
I am a hustler man, and I can't stop it
I'll rock for rock it, I want all the profit
Put it in my pocket, I'm sticking to the topic
Life is a hustle man, so can't nobody knock it
Hustle and hustle, till I can't no mo'
And I hustle and hustle, till my calves get so'
And I hustle and hustle, till I get all the do'
And it's a must when I hustle, I do it solo
Don't need no sidekicks, or niggas that ride dick
With that fly shit, and on the crew they really a snitch
Who the fuck you working with, the F-E-D's
H.P.D's, get up off my N-U-T's
You cats is wanna-be's, boy I do this to eat
Better listen to Lil' Head, be safe in these streets

[Hook - 2x]

[Lil' Keke]
Take the good with the bad, respect it just like a man
It's still some mo' to fight, but losing ain't in the plan
Rocks and fry sticks, bricks and big licks
On to cut your stick, with the niggas you click with
The pyrex's shake, no mistakes and flakes
The bakery in the hood, serving cookies and cakes
So I hustle till I can't, I ain't just running my mouth
Ain't no future on the block, so I'm stretching my socks
I done set my price, I ain't gon change for the streets
Me and my workers got families, we both gotta eat
So I shake boys, you cowards just making noise
Life is still a struggle, I hustle and get it hard
For the fam, I don't give a damn that's who I am
Put the plates on the table, daddy gon bring the spam
Get your cash too fast, I'll be taking it slow
Gotta grind to get mine, till I can't no mo' whoa[Intro: Lil Keke]
Yeah, H-Town all stars in the building, that's right
Lil Keke the don, yes
Check it out

[Verse 1: Lil Keke]
Seven-thirteen homey, I been on
Yeah we been here and y'all sho been gone
Screwed up captain, still repping the south
And can't none of y'all cut me off, I'm alive
Make 'em southside, cause that's Texas pride
Pimp C got me swangin' it wide, so be quiet
Bey still repping it right for H-Town
Don Keke's draped up, chopped and screwed down

[Verse 2: Slim Thug]
I've been on, I've been on
Since back when I had braids on my dome
Underground king, sitting on my throne
Me and Bey done did number one songs
Riding candy and chrome, this Texas
Could buy a Bentley cash with this necklace
This H-Town, we drive reckless
We make 'em bow down, they gon' respect us

[Hook x2: Beyoncé]
I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me who gon take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off

[Verse 3: Willie D]
I am Houston, rep it hard
Cup with R, candy cars
Geto Boys, Willie D
You're plexing with Bey, you're plexing with me
These dudes in the streets, be acting mob
But go to the pen, and be playing with them boys
They are not me, they're carbon copies
If God got me, who gon' stop me

[Verse 4: Scarface]
I been on, now who you goons gon' get to knock me off?
I've been boss, been on slabs, been on paint
Been on fours homey, I've been on drank, I've been had bank
Twenty-five years and ain't fell off yet, cause my flow that wet
You don't want no plex, they talk that sh-
The Queen Bey said you better bow down, bow down

[Hook x2: Beyoncé]

[Verse 5: Z-Ro]
On, I could never be off
Hit the boulevard so hard, it'd never be soft
Yellow bone so long, looking like they reach out
Set of diamonds and gold in damn near each mouth
They call it Styrofoam City; Houston, Texas to be exact
Swangas on anything, it ain't gotta be a Lac
If I say I got sixteen, it ain't gotta be a rap
All them d-boys in them traps, they gotta feel that

[Verse 6: Bun B]
We the big ballers and big bodies in fresh foreigners
Fresh up off the road from hustling and rap touring
While you sleeping and snoring, we creeping and pouring
BaddieBey and the Bun, baby, you can't ignore 'em
Represent for Port Arthur, get it right off the water
How you want it hard or soft, put in your order
Never the hesitators, shaking off all the haters
Ridin' for Pimp, Screw and all the Lone Star Staters, hol' up

[Hook: Beyoncé]

[Outro: Beyoncé]
I remember my baby hair with my dookie braids
Frenchy’s, Boudin in the parking lot
Shout out to Willie D
I was in that Willie D video when I was about fourteen, looking crazy
Shout out Pimp C
You know we used to sneak and listen to that UGK
Didn’t do your girl but your sister was alright, damn
In ya homeboy’s Caddy last night man, haha
Hold up, Texas trill
H-Town going down, man[E.S.G.]
Here comes the Wreckshop bomb, that Big H.A.W.K. didn't refuse
Coming down on a song, I couldn't refuse
I'm with the Jam Down Don, Botany Boy boss
Put a fo' in the room, we gon break boys off
Wide body Denali, I'm riding Y2 grey
Tell the FED's I ain't scared, I'm down with the D.E.A
E.S.G. and Big H.A.W.K., got boys under our wings
I'm about to let 'em up, Lamborgini with screens
What you mean you can't dance, to the Screwed Up Click
Make the world boom-boom, tap-tap to it
Through the do-do, man here come the pro-pro
Freestyle King, and I'm so damn throwed though
Wrist fully froze, with the princess cuts
So much ice on my piece, look like a cooled cup
Man hold up, haters in a trance
Southside crunk, pop your trunk and make it dance huh

[Lil' Keke]
It's fa sho, we step in the do' motivated
My click iced out, prepare to be faded
My watch my wrist, my neck so crushing
We hit the dance flo', and bitches start rushing
Get your shake on, what you waiting on what you got
Do that thang, work that thang you're hot
Oh yeah you looking good, but I just might pass
Cause you ain't working hard enough, put some bounce in that ass
You want some cash, wrong nigga wrong time
Girl you way out of line, I'm for real bout mine
Now do that strut, shake that butt what
Since you walked up in the club, you been backing it up
Here we go, she back on the flo' touching her toe
The first to let her know, that I don't love no ho
And the party don't start, right after mic check
All the people gon dance, when Screw wreck the deck what

(*DJ Screw scratching*)

[H.A.W.K.]
I can make you dance, bust the seam if your pants
Make you shake it so hard, you need a ambulance
Put boys in a trance, cause the three point stance
Have you screaming like Biggie, give me one more chance
Biting mics like hands, and Paris Bueller in France
Now I'll blind you with my piece, with the slightest glance
My game is advanced, with my Screwed Up style
Make you back that ass up, like Juvenile
Crushed ice in my smile, live a lavish lifestyle
And my freestyle, makes me so versatile
On my feet crocodile, keep a low profile
And one night with me, I'll make it worth your while
I'm the golden child, call me H-A-W-K
And making money, is my authority
Year Y2K, now my stocks done grew
And we can make you dance, when you jamming Screw

(*DJ Screw scratching*)

[C-Note]
Baby I can make you dance, here's your chance don't miss it
Bezeltines fancy things, pinky rings kiss it
Bentley with automatic stuff, we playa bout
We making hoes get under our wings, like Big H.A.W.K
C-Note on top the charts, Big Shots off the heezy
I'm quick to wreck shop on them bops, like E.S.Geezy
For sheezy, man we making cash forever
My drop got the glass, with the grilling leather
However, we represent for the South
Plenty diamonds on my hand, plenty diamonds in my mouth
We pull up at Mega Meg, platinum over grey
I can make the drop dance, you can make that ass shake
Don't hate, baby girl I'mma keep it real
C-Note without his grill, like a fish with no gill
Just another platinum, from the Screwed Up Click
Me, Big H.A.W.K., and E and Ke' we dropping platinum shit

(*DJ Screw scratching*)[Kay-K]
I'm stuck in this world, I'm worrying about my paper
All the hustlers know the paper rules
Thinking about the (?) for my eyes
And all the players clocking G's, aside(?)
Now it's time for me to slip on the ave, got my big gal
Got my bourbon on slab, the bullet (?)
More fiends and we're clocking the G's(?)
I got five on it, wanna come smoke with me?
(?) for the '95 to the '96
The drop top 400, (?) yeah bitch?
Young in the game, I'm never gonna change
As long as my flows (?), I'mma swang
For my neighborhood, where it's all good
I'm rolling (?) on some wood
A point understood
Gon' go catch a fucking case
It's Kay-K in the industry in your face
First I blow up with my syrup in my cup
I represent the '96 all Screwed Up

[DJ Screw]
So much stress, damn I can't cope
With all the drank and syrup and blowing killa smoke
Staying on my hustle, each and every day
Me and (?) that's the only way
To survive as a young black youth
I done Screwed Up the whole rap industry
Screwed Up Click, coming in '96
And all you jealous player haters, y'all can eat a dick
Cus it don't stop, and you know I'm stayin' down
Representing the south side, for the H-Town
Putting in work all day it ain't no joke
I'm about a drank, Kay go and buy the smoke
Six deep in the bourbon, steady flippin'
Nigga we some players, we ain't set trippin'
Better keeps my nine for them niggas outta line
If it be a murder I ain't scared to do the time
I let the nigga beat it on lock outta state(?)
Man to be a trip, how to be this player hater(?)
But we gon' keep flippin' and you know we high side
Cus the nigga Screw is gonna get me some wine(?)

[H.A.W.K.]
Say Screw done got beat, got his face in the syrup
Saying where's the alcohol? So nah, here's the main course
Now I done grabbed the mic so you know it's time to wreck
Got a (?) five birds (?) to the deck
Got licked up in Asia and Iran
Stopped off in Florida sold the bird to this chick(?)
Sipping on the paint so you know I'm in the lean
Got my last check, so I sold it to a kid/key(?)
Made major moves didn't have no hassle
Now I'm back in my (?) flipping to my castle(?)
That's the way it is, the way I want it to be
Those were my dreams, now here's reality
Born as a hustler since my first day of birth
Struggling in this game trying to get what it's worth
Now that I'm older I done really got wise
Known for my homies and these hoes I despise
Bell Biv Devoe and (?)
How you niggas learn from the bitch (?)
Hoes by the name of (?) with a little money
Pussy was the scent to make him act funny
Turn against your friends make your (?)
Now she's (?) down the boulevard
Now the moral of the story always stay a G
Never get took by a piece of pussy
Now I keep (?) travelling foreign places
And I keep stacking dead presidents' faces
Now I'm a bitch to the bay(?)
It's another lesson from the H.A.W.K

[Lil' KeKe]
Summer rising (?), hair line receding
Car steady speeding, (?)
The corners of the streets, and three of them are shiest
But the last corner is the chapter of my life
The game is a book, I stop and took a look
And then I figured out I had the skills of a crook
My plan and my wages, turning my pages
Changing my ages, levels and stages
Blood steady pumping through my veins and soul
Smoke coming out my mouth and out of my nose
Stress on my chest, burning me like sess
Selling it for less, really ain't the best
So I drift back to the days of the south
I was sipping my ass and a quarter in my mouth
Now I realized that the game is more drastic
Drapers in my car but it could be up in my casket
So pay attention, oh did I mention
The song that we singing is a Screwed Up invention
Rocks up in my wrist, dirt up in my piss(?)
Haters in my face, long against my list
Stacking me a bank, sipping on this drank
Getting up on my knees, because the lord is who I thank
I'm ending this song with a touch of class
When I'm on the mic, I shows my naked ass
Thanks for your support, what you would put forth
Pay me my money, or meet me up in court
Get up off my dick, we left the world sick
This is Lil' Keke representing the Screwed Up Click[Hook]
I'm up early in the mornin'-thinkin bout gettin this money
Lord knows I gotta get that paper
The hustlers told me that I gotta go an get it
Now I'm gettin it the best way I know how
I won't let you down

[Verse 1 - Chamillionaire]
Yeah! Our time has come, and your time has passed
Get out the way while I grind for cash
Money in the bank, and the rest be stashed
When it's all done I will not be last
Y'all know me, y'all gon'see - Ben Franklin is my homie
E-y-e's is all on me, so lay it down like Ball & G
No I can't be commercial, show e'm how to bring it to the streets for all my doggs
Ridin dirty, flyin birdies - pop the trunk when I pass the law
Houston do we have a problem, obviously the answers 'Nah'
Ball hoggers won't pass the ball - I'm a steal that rock then pass to y'all
[I won't let you down]

[Verse 2 - Slim Thug]
I'm on my block around the clock tryna get it
If it get ya paid I did, got caught gotta quit it
Got out and got back up on my grind again
Cause you gotta play the game if you tryna win
And hustle money ain't fuh sho, so I ain't tryna spend
Cause the minute you come up ya back down again
I promise I won't let you down momma
When it's the first of the month I'll be around momma
[I won't let you down]

[Verse 3 - Lil' Keke]
Pound for pound, ups and downs but I'm still real
Chasin paper, money runnin like a treadmill
I'm just a G in the street game we raise numbers
I never let ya down, I never disapoint ya
I'm up extra early - posted like a war solider
My hustle hard like I cut it with some baking soda
Heart of a gangsta to the grind mayne I'm so commited
Lord knows if I see the paper I'm a get it

[Hook]
I'm up early in the mornin' - thinkin bout gettin this money
Lord knows I gotta get that paper
The hustlers told me that I gotta go an get it
Now I'm gettin it the best way I know how
I won't let you down, won't let you down(*repeat 4x*]

[Verse 4 - Mike Jones]
H - Town got it on my back, chrome 84's on the Cadillac
I stack stacks and stack plaques
Ice Age we run the town - Ice Age we shuttin e'm down
As long as I'm makin multiply(I won't let you down]
My new album is on the way - when you say my name you say I'm paid
H - Town we here to stay(Mike Jones]
A millionaire can you imagine that?
Two time plaque can you add to that? - eleven cars can you handle that?
[I won't let you down]

[Verse 5 - Trae]
If you lookin for the south, you can tell e'm I'm home
On the block you can tell e'm I ain't leavin till it's gone
Thinkin'I ain't you can tell e'm they wrong
When I pull up glass house with the roof half gone
If it come to gettin paid, understand that I got e'm
Sittin back broke - I'm a show you that I'm not them
Now I'm in the hood full time tryna rock them
Yeah I'm from the streets, no way you finna block them
Mouth full of rocks, yeah money well blown - everytime I talk now, money well shown
But just because I rap, don't think a fly cat - I hop in all black and still run up in ya home
Trae Tha Truth I got hustle and flow
I do it for the ones tryna hustle and score
Every hour, everyday until my body get sore
One hundred percent and my hustle is showed

[Verse 6 - Paul Wall]
So when the streets is talkin and they tellin me to go get that cake
No time to waste I can't wait cause I got bread to break
These boys is fake, they bumpin they gums - sayin they payin dues
But they preoccupied up in the mall, buyin they gal shoes
I'm motivated by the diamond chains and ice grills
A Johnny Dang watch and a Cadillac on 4's with crater wheels
I'm cash collectin, still trill - chasin a dollar bill
My apetite is never filled, when chasin after these mills(I gotta grind]

[Verse 7 - Bun B]
From sun down to the sun up
You know Big Bun up, tryna get his paper and his gun up
Can't let these haters get one up on me or try to run up
Gotta leave e'm gun up and get up - you wanna get down, get up
I leave ya hit up and split up - so pay attention sit up
And keep ya eyes on the target
That's Bun Beata the King, he be goin the hardest
Not only is he the trillest but also he's the smartest
Gangsta slash rap artist
[I won't let you down]

[Verse 8 - Lil' Flip]
Let me tell you a lil' somethin 'bout a G like me
I gotta whole bunch of money and a whole bunch of weed
Rap ain't dead, the trap ain't dead
I'm still gettin bread in my hood with D - Red
Tell me a rapper you know with a crib and a bank account with 5 in it
You losin fuck, I'm Scrooge Mcduck - my money piles I dive in it
Flippin and mackin I'm stackin my paper, you haters better fall back
The south wack - Hell no, and Rest In Peace to Big Moe
The cheaper my work, my beeper alert - all day and all night
We ride gray, we sell white - we buy Haze and pour up Sprite

[Verse 9 - Z - Ro]
24/7, three sixty five tryna get rich is on our mind
Houston, Texas we ain't nothin but some go getters - and some trendsetters and we stayin on our grind
Remember when the world said, down south rappers couldn't rap
Now the down south rappers all across the map
Representin my city and I'm a wear it on my back
It's official damn right the south is back
Even though we ain't never really went no where, we always been here
We make good music, and we stack big money, and we act bad - all godamn year
Gotta give it to us cause if not we gon'take it and never give it back
That's just how it's gon'go
It's been every year in Houston, Texas
But ain't a damn thing change you can still count on Z - Ro

[Verse 10 - Scarface]
Money my motive, my mission is to be holdin
Atleast two hundred million or mo
Cause if I'm closin I won't it
Where it's set up for the next generation of Jordan's
So that next generation of Jordan's will have it easy
That's why I'm out here movin this work
Creative legacy, avoidin Kennedy's curse, my heart beats heavenly
I love you son for all that it's worth
And down to die became to the worst
[I won't let you down]

[Verse 10 - Pimp C]
You call in some cars, I be in jets
Google "Pimp C" I'm all over the internet
The paint over the Lac is so glass
UGK for life, I need to teach a pimpin class
Cause I'm gettin my paper, reppin my house
Say what I want to, out my mouth
15 years I'm what it's about
Land of the south, that's no doubt
Pimp a snitch, you'se a clown
Say my name, it's gon'go down
You rent yo car, you rent yo house
You kiss that girl, I been in ya mouth, Huh
[I won't let you down]Another Myke Diesel production

[Hook x2: Pimp C]
Knocking, knocking doors down, showing 'cuz around
Knocking doors down, showing 'cuz around
Knocking, knocking doors down, showing 'cuz around
I'ma, I'ma come through and show my wood pine

[Verse 1: Pimp C]
R.I.P. to Robert Davis, he the king of the south
Anything else said, need to shut your fucking mouth
I'm down with Lil' Flip, and I'm down with T.I.P
If them niggas come together, know how much paper we could see?
Slim Thug and Z-Ro, y'all still bullshitting
Need to sit down, take a tour, there's too much money to be get
Paul Wall and that Koopa still ain't talking
Money speak, all that bullshit keep walking
Y'all niggas got the game fucked up
All you record company people need to shut the fuck up
Cause y'all keeping up that bullshit rapping
The white people laughing at 'em, that's what's happening
The same stupid ass niggas still ain't figured it out
Long as they stay divided, man we gon' run the south
Y'all need to get up out the dumb shit
I got a bread truck, get up out that crumb shit, nigga

[Hook x2: Pimp C]

[Verse 2: P.O.P.]
Hey, I got the bass quaking, trunk shaking like tambourines
In the H, where them paints sweet as tangerines
Where they bouncing on fours like trampolines
It's the great state of Texas so I can't believe
All the conflict and plex that we carrying
It's time to get rid of the beef like vegetarians
I'm 'bout stacking bank, everyday
So I pay attention to the vets and I ain't talking 'bout a Chevrolet
Keke the Don, Pimp C a king
Lil' J, the owner of the squad, H-Town, we the team
It ain't no I in that, you trying that, you be fatigued
But if we man up and press, we could lead the league
We some all-stars, the roster is sick, man
I ain't gotta start, P.O.P.'ll be the sixth man
Rap-A-Lot's a southern empire for the assist, man
Three, two, one, swish, and

[Hook x2: Pimp C]

[Verse 3: Lil' Keke]
You see the slab outside, it look good, don't it?
Masterpiece, dripped out, with the fours on it
Trunk airtight, speakers and them show lights
Holding, cops around, nigga get your shit tight
Let me tell you the meaning of coming through
When the seats off-cream and the candy is dark blue
Approaching downtown, knocking doors down
Tint eleven slabs in a single-file line
Flossing, swerving, the rims is glistening
They gotta see the wood cause the top is missing
I sleep on dreams cause it's paper I'm chasing
My roots come from Texas, this Pimpalation
The barre is tasty, the Benz is spacey
I gotta show my class so these haters can face me
Riding up the boulevard, crushing the sidewalk
Showing my surround while I'm knocking the doors off

[Hook x2: Pimp C](Verse 1, Yo Gotti)
Got a spot in the A
Got a spot in N.O. (Fo' sho')
Lookin for them real toys, to see what they goin fo'
Down hurr in Texas
When I'm ballin at Max's
Get a bitch, fuck a hotel
Hit the crib, relaxin
Them Body boys
They bringin noise
Mike Jones and Paul Wall
Slim Thug and Bun B and Z-Ro and all y'all
I'm Y-O, G-O, double T to the I, trick
Don't get it confused though, I represent this Memphis shit
Represent for the real niggas
For the drug dealers, for the hard hitters
Represent for my brother doin the 10 years in Fort Piller
Represent for the Dirty South
Gettin that money, what we about
Livin the life, rockin ice
That's why I put 20 g's in my mouth
See them diamonds, see me shinin
Hear me rhymin, see me climbin
Straight to the top of the charts, bitch
Like this shit on lock, bitch

(Hook, Lil Keke)
Just call on me (Homie)
And you got a plane
You gon' need
Somebody, to leeeaaaan onnnn
Lean on me

(Verse 2, Slim Thug)
I'm puffin green, strong
Sippin, get my lean on
Comin down, candy paint
Get my gleam on
The fo' poured up
The 'Dro rolled up
One-deep, with the heat
Beat slowed up
I'm outta Memphis, Ten
With about ten to spend
Got with Gotti, put me down with some lady friends
I'm showin diamond grin, leanin, walkin wit' a limp
Hoes on the 'vard, "It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp"
I'm Slim Thugga motherfucka, dirty south boss
Eyes low from the 'Dro, plus I'm cotton-mouth
That's how we do it down in Texas, holdin wood-wheel
"Swang n' Bang" down the lane, til' my drank spill
Blow kill', bet the Kush get'cha mind right
Everythang I drive candy, so I shine bright
I'm either on the grind, tryin'a get my bank on
Or on recline mayn, tryin'a get my drank on

(Hook)

Hol' up, hol' up
Roll up, roll up
Ho what, ho what
Hol' up, hol' up
Roll up, roll up
(Lean on me)
Ho what, ho what
Hol' up, hol' up
Roll up, roll up
Ho what, ho what
Hol' up, hol' up
Roll up, roll up
Ho what, ho what
(Lean on me)[Hook]
Time to let the truth be told, it ain't no brighter days
Cause when it all unfolds, a nigga gon just pass away
These haters, trying to stop my grind
But I bet them hoes, can't block my shine
So tired of taking losses, not this time
I can't save the whole world, I'm just trying to look out for mine

[Z-Ro]
I been getting a lot of exposure lately, on niggas songs and in they videos
Cause they know I'm a O.G., not an original gangsta but an organized general
They see me pulling up in my 300 banging, gators on my feet and jewelry dangling
Everybody love the way I look on the outside, but inside I be paining
Is it ever gonna stop raining, nothing but thunderstorm clouds hover above me
Shit I use to break my back to make sure my niggas was straight, but they still don't love me
That's why it's no more pain on my lower arm, and one deep tatted on my other arm
If you see me looking in y'all direction, I'm not about to speak fin to do you motherfuckers harm
Got seventeen albums and they all selling, so tell me why the fuck my pockets ain't swelling
Ain't never did nothing to nobody, that didn't have it coming to 'em bitch I'm a felon
Feel like I was failing God tell me when I'm gon win, you know when I'm blessed you know when I'm gon sin
You were there at the beginning of my days, I'm just hoping I see you after all my days end
And I don't give a damn what these people say, half the people in the church got evil ways
I was just looking to make a lil' scrilla, but it turned a lil' Christian into a lil' killer
From label to label and gun to rifle, it's a forward march ain't no time to retreat
If you able to save a nation go 'head, but I'm struggling to get myself some'ing to eat

[Hook]

[Lil' Keke]
No more struggling, backwards hustling this is my year
I been in the game since 9-5, bitch I'm still here
I hear that background that side talk, that cheek bumping
If you don't like who I signed (Swishahouse), then give me some'ing
Just six months ago, they said the Don was all over
But I just tightened my flow built the buzz, and came colder
I touch them street G's, them go-getters and crack stars
You six feet deep or somewhere asleep, behind them iron bars
Cause I done knocked off plenty cars, and knocked off plenty hoes
Then pulled up plenty shows, candy paint and glass 4's
Look at 'em whispering, like some hoes on the sideline
They second string and cheerleading, while I'm getting mine
I know I been down, can't wait till the next round
Tomorrow's tomorrow, but today nigga it's right now
It's Ke and Ro, and fa sho that's a gangsta hit
Get up out our life ho, get up off our dick trick

[Hook][Chourus1: Lil' Keke]

Gots to be a G till the day that I die, (Thats right)
Gots to be a G till the day that I die, (Hey..Hey)
Gots to be a G till the day that I die,(Ima g)(Ima g)
Gots to be a G till the day that I die
I Got to be a G (Real niggas stand up)

Gots to be a G till the day that I die

[Verse 1: Lil' Keke]

Lord have mercy momma done raised a real thug
Me and my daddy cool but he showed me tough love
Fifteen I was asked out getting grown
By this time my old man had just moved on
Momma couldn't drive so she didn't have a car
And I could still see my T-lady walking' far
Sweat on her face, purse and a grocery bag
Me and my sister shit that's all we ever had
Stuck my chest out became the man of the house
Now I'm the bread winner, go get it at any cost
Flipping burgers, washing cars, and cutting yards
I graduated to cooking soft and selling hard
High school is over with I'm on a path
To more hoes more dough and a new slab
Ima B.G hard headed so fly
But ma gangsta and like this till I die
(Know what I'm saying)

[Hook 2: Birdman]

Gots to be a G till the day that I die(brrrrrrrd)

[Verse 2: Birdman]

I say my hood is a mess the O.G's done got dressed wit the red
They heard the Lil' homie got wet
So them AK's spraying blood for the young blood
You know us nigga is riding us
We fly 25's on them new trucks
We high till we die you can't see us
G for buring purple bush on that kush
Leanin on the lean and them guns stay took
Stunting on them bitches in god we trust
I'll ink my whole body I don't give a mother fuck
Redid the new grill iced out block cuts
Like father like son real niggas stand up
I'm wall paper dog I hustle in the fall
Slept with the gater roll wit guerillas
Built real niggas, a cash money nigga
Young money nigga we them real go gettas
(Belive that)

[Hook 3: Lil' Keke]

Gots to be a G till the day that I die

Gots to be a G till the day that I die
Gots to be a G (Real niggas stand up)
Gots to be a G (O.G's stand up)
Gots to be a G (I'm here nigga)(hahaaaaa)
Gots to be a G till the day that I die

[Verse 3: Lil' Keke]

Fuck a diploma I'm smuthered in the dro aroma
Still on probation if I piss then Ima gonna
Catch a pistol case for I leave it at the crib
Welcome to hershalwood soldiers get it how they live
A million blocks but they all end at one road
The streets a motherfucker ride till the car explode
Niggas lose your vests I'm taking head shots
Fuck a new story evidence and sub blocks
Pressure bust a pipe kept it real and stayed at it
Them old snitch niggas know the game and still ratted
I'm at the weed house wit 20 bags and 3 for ten
I had a closed mind I wasn't listening back then
Stuck in one spot trying to learn to manage money
Fuck them air Jordans the sky ain't forever sunny
Keep a full clip jackers might wanna visit
Ima G chasing down the same meal ticket
(Know what I'm sayin)(Thats right)

[Hook 5:]

Gots to be a G till the day that I die
Gots to be a G till the day that I die (Real talk)
Gots to be a G till the day that I die
Gots to be a G till the day that I die
Gots to be a G (O.G's stand up)
Gots to be a G (Crones da bricks nigga)
Gots to be a G (I come from nothing)(hahaaaaa)
Gots to be a G till the day that I die
(hey)(hey)[Hook]
Ride, ride, ride clean
If you, if you ride old, ride slow
Candy, candy paint, slamming these doors
If you ride old, ride slow, ride old, ride slow
Ride old, ride slow, slamming, slamming these doors

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
I remember way back in the day
All I wanted was a candy car with hella flakes
Crushing hoes, slamming doors while the chassis shake
From the sub, work the juice, bitch I want the bass
Can't be turning on a dime cause the rims scrape
Kill switches for them jackers outchea tryna take
That's my prized possession in recession kept me straight
Clear my mind then recline on the runway, from Monday to Sunday
Just me and my old school

[Hook]

[Verse 2: LiL KeKe]
I got the old school right on these toes and slamming doors
Talking wood grain, mink on the floors and riding vogues
Chopping low, tip by slow, that’s how it go
Still a Texas boy sitting on foes and wrecking hoes
The seats so sandy fine, all cash
Fresh candy homie, branded wine - hold it down
H-town known to flip - feeling hood, looking good
With them boys out to sip, just let it dip
Convertible, the burgundy red get’s peeled off
I’m on glass when I’m showing my ass for dirty south
Don key still OG - just like the smoke fool
Riding 3 deep, me and KRIT - plus the old school

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Slim Thug]
I used to roll in my old school, listenin’ to slow grooves
Head leaning back, had me feeling like a mac
7 mills dark black, I used to think I was goldie
"I see you shining balls on", that’s what my OG’s told me
And my old school so cool, roll like a new school
Escalate motor got it riding like a soldier
Late nights blowing dojer, reminiscing bout the past
And how now I got everything I wish I used to could have
I'm finally clean in my old school

[Hook]

[Outro]
See it ain't just a car, it ain't just a whip
It's a time machine, it's a spaceship, it's precious
You gotta take your time, you can't be rubbing on them curbs
And hitting them potholes
You gotta ride clean and ride slow
Me and my old school

[Hook]
