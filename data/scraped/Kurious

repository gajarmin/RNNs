[Produced by MF DOOM]

[Intro: Dr. Doom]
My servants began to forge what was to become
The most dreaded costume on the face of the earth
The last thing to fit was the mask
Will it conform to my twisted features in comfort

[Verse 1: MF Doom]
He cleans his metal mask with gasoline, they after him
Last seen pulling chicks like a fiend pull a fast one
Can't put shit past him
Got niggas on his own team mad enough to blast him
Retarded in real life, on the mic Rain Man
Stand close to his main man like a chain gang
Who give a fuck about who or they fancy crew
That's no mystery that Hardy Boys do with Nancy Drew
Sorta with her drawers down quarter
The extorter bring slaughter like "Well I oughta"
I suggest you hand over the formula doula
A villain in your land, in his land a ruler
Hard hitting like puffing a woola with Lieutenant Uhura
Every day feel like it's an off day with Ferris Bueller
Brother pull heat to prove they not sweet
No matter how you spell it, we still got beats

[Verse 2: Kurious]
Don't question how we live, question what we give
Take it to the next leave 'em where they can't see me
Still they judge, but they be butt ass
Twist that wig like a muppet, keep it simple, can't truss it
Light's the fuel, mic is the tool
Drink Jack, kick back, drop jewel, finish what I start
Mastered the art, living hell can't explain it
Inhale confuse it more, cop the .44
Contemplate, meditate, dictate
I direct my direct fate, coming of late
Kurious, can I say shit
Do it for CottleRock, do it for K.Nit
(RIP)
K-N-I-T, Sub R-O-C
(Eternally for M-I-C)
Only we save we

[Verse 3: MF Doom]
By candlelight my hand will write these rhymes 'til I'm burnt out
Mostly from experience, shit that I learned about
Topics and views, generally concerned about
With different ways to come up and earn clout
I take a look at my life and pace the trails
From Tablik and savage females with fake nails to face veils
You out your frame but still bagging 'em too
You know I know, these hoes be asking me if I'm you
Like my twin brother, we did everything together
From hundred raka'at salats to copping butter leathers
Remember when you went and got the dark blue Ballys
I had all the different color Cazals and Gazelles
The "SUBROC" three-finger ring with the ruby in the "O", ock
Truly the illest dynamic duo on the whole block
I keep a flick of you with the machete sword in your hand
Everything is going according to plan man[Verse 1: Biolante/Kurious]
Only god is judge, never plea the case
Always aware of the truth we could never erase
Fallen from grace black North face
Ounce of green smoke, jack wit no chase
Peddle on the floor, thirsty for score, Fastlane
Destination: top of the cash game
Seek heat like a missle with mad aim
You can't blame
Missin spirits who campaign
A mystery at most, universal most stee is hot
Yup more often then not!
Vision clear like a Hindu with the third eye dot
We be weak...nah baby that's my word I got
Nuff rhymes, tuff times try talkin to kids
Who walk around thinkin that (God) doesn't forgive
Life in itself is like a bid
And if you scared to die then you scared to live
Ain't it a shame dealin with the remain
Hennessy on the brain, travel the plane

[Hook: Biolante]
Will the copy cats twist the def traps
Bliss the sex raps, blind to jet black
Matters awake in response since came to life
Singin a seance, escape the realm
Bly swift like 'o' at, fake jacks a cast
Catch two smacks, gentlemen relax
Blaze trails that haven't been traveled in a while
Scatter clues for those who equate the style

[Verse 2: Biolante]
Cruisin' in the Lex out the window seat
While I be trippin' off the rhyme, bop my head to the beat
I can't speak on delirious mood swings
True crowns, are handed to true kings
Tell ya take it back, straighten, money makin'
Vital sign: Awaken. Idle minds go to Satan
No debatin' on the vestle that we navigatin'
Gravitatin', schemin', leave 'em standin' waitin'
Specialize in futuristic mental picture paintin'
We are slave to sick ways, I'm quenchin' with thirst
Gift of a new day they seem like a curse
What we made, penetrate the charade
The incision is barely felt from the sharpness of the blade
Movin' motionless through this masquerade
Loomin' in the dark, but just to save a spark (Rock)
Like a match made in Heaven and Hell apart
But still one, if it's life we start
So real, reveal, sign is sealed
What we feels translates to meals
That 9-to-5 shit is no joke, muscle in
Scientist, but don't look upon my hustlin'

[Hook: Biolante]

"Look at them, those two space monsters. The one with the three heads is King Geedorah
And that one's Gigan. We are controlling them.""Why do you keep smoking that shit? Why will you keep smoking that shit?
Why??? Why??? Why do you keep smoking that shit?"

Aight, check it out yo, check it out yo
I'mma flip yo, check it out - bust it

[Zev Love X]
I connect to spots like connect-the-dots
From the Lower East Side, to way up top
I got a map too, express on the 6, I found you
Where they got the raw dog smoke at Soundview
Now, two nicks damnit, do you understand?
Nuff respect to the dread man or I'mma dead man
I ain't no fake man for the red hand
It's just my Walkman with instructions from Redman
Whomever I step to, remove the Phillie filter
Cause I used to know this bitch and it killed her (that bitch is dead)
I'm smokin that shit, cause I got a thousand jokes
Like puttin your moms in the yoke cause she broke some choke
Bitch, you're blowin up the spot, be out
Yo either get some dough, or get the fuck down South
With your bitch-ass son, and tell him throw up his dukes
So I can spend his lunch loot at noop noop

[Kurious]
Check it
I do the hip, hop, the hibby, the hibby dibby
Kurious the too-fly magician, never givin
These niggas a piece of my pie, cause yo my shit is fat
Just like my pockets your girl's titties is flat
So when the bitch slid in correct with the funk from the big bra
I kindly reply, with a smile, aiyyo chill hooooot damn
Uh uh uh, I'm so sorry uhh
Eat your tits, cause them shits is from Somalia
Check it out, on the one to the two
It's some shit from the zoo, it's the C.M. crew
Now from the cocks with the blocks on the street or the goat
With the 40, the Glocks, the Phillie and the smoke
Just like George Bush is the type to drop bombs
George Kemprias will smoke scarm wit'cha moms
Throw a 50 yard pass, with a afro pick
To Steve, Earthquake, stop smokin that shit

[Earthquake]
I keep my gun out my holster, I'm wanted on the poster
Cause I shot the sheriff who knocked the cherry off my shoulder
He tried to get cute, so Earthquake, had to erase him
And place him, in America's Top Ten, like Casey Kasem
I tracked him, an actor, with no sense of humor
If you heard I fell off nigga, it's only just a rumor
So step the fuck back, 'fore you get your shit cracked
I had to think up a plan, so now I'm fat like that
280 pounds of pure funk, and no junk
I snatch a ho bitch up, just like Dave, did The Chipmunks
Kid I'm rough tough, strong enough to call your bluff
Handcuff your wife up, while your bitch, give me a buff
I do run run run, I do run the MC's
The king of rap, you don't believe me? Believe these!
Def rhymes on wax, don't call me, send a fax
I slam hard like Anthrax, so turn it up to the max
STOP! You're pinchin my nerves, with rap slurs
I do my best herb, now it's time to get served
So suck my dick, I don't smoke that shit
I don't want this shit, so you flip the script

[Hook]
You know I'm on that shit - STOP SMOKIN THAT SHIT
You know I'm on that shit - STOP SMOKIN THAT SHIT
I'm always always on that shit - STOP SMOKIN THAT SHIT
Yeah I'm on that shit - STOP SMOKIN THAT SHIT

[Verse Four]
Stop smokin that shit, 'fore you get killed
You know the flavor my man, so just chill
Now hold your head up and hold your head high
Stop smokin the dust, you just might die
Relax your mainframe, the bolder gets paid
And you won't have no motherfuckin {?}
As you know, I'm on the microphone to make you all know
That shit that you smoke will make you mad broke
I don't give a fuck about you and your crew
I'm not too love sick, drink that brew I'm a Nancy Drew
I don't solve mysteries, never wearin Lees
I got the motherfuckin S.I. to be, where it seed
So pack up, my man I went out of breath
I got asthma on the side, take it on to the left
So stop smokin that shit my man
And I'm out, see ya later, so kick the can

[Subroc]
I drink Colt 45 and talk in mad jive
You know I stay alive, my niggas stay alive
Easy on the smoke, I don't really feel like tokin
I gotta save some breath for this bitch I be strokin
Everyday I make a nigga get right
Jealous-ass, pussy-ass nigga can't fight
I'm in my new disguise, feedin pigeons
Ducks, any bird, and bond's my word (word is bond)
I make gadgets, illy, ill toys that kill
Sleep on me, you'll get a sleepin pill
Pin that nigga, down right on the mat (bang!)
If you ain't my nigga, don't reach for no gat
Slap, right to the head
I'm blitzed to whip that ass, {?} style, dead
Y'knahmsayin?

[Outro]
SMOKIN THAT SHIT
Yeah, c'mon - SMOKIN THAT SHIT
You see a nigga you know - SMOKIN THAT SHIT
My man you're cold - SMOKIN THAT SHIT
Kurious Jorge I know you're not - SMOKIN THAT SHIT
Zev Love what you doin? SMOKIN THAT SHIT
Stop SMOKIN THAT SHIT, stop SMOKIN THAT SHIT
Hahaha, smokin that motherfuckin shit!
Word up, yeah yeah, smokin that shit
Smokin that motherfuckin shit, you're motherfuckin right
Put the fuckin pipe down!![Verse 1: Kurious]

[Verse 2: The Audible Doctor]

We've been holding this up for years and ya'll can't even raise your hands
Like you in class embarrassed in front of your peers
I'm done dumbing it down son, the sound you hear
Was designed to avoid leaving a void between your ears
And while they toying with my fears I be destroying every stage that I stand on
And planned on this as my career
Except it seems that no matter where my dreams at with these cats
It's more about a fad than a fan that can hear
The true meaning, I've been through feuds with a few demons
Leaving worn down souls/soles like shoes leaning
Believe it
You semen/see men spit like hoes without the kleenex
And then wonder why the seeds hit the cement
Out in the street with nobody to teach kids
Stop buying that weak shit support something decent
I preach this
And each and every time you reach for a record
Be sure you check for the B-B-A-S bitch respect it
They ain't listening
I grip the pen tight and write till blisters end the session
Sending tension up my tendons just to represent
I've gotten ill at this, I don't mean that I'm nice
I mean I've literally gotten sick from staying up nights
Just trying to write and make beats for weeks at a time
He's tight but he can't speak over beats when he's dying
And it's trying his emotions that nobody know his name
He's just in it for the rent and utilities fuck the fame
It's a shame how you put your love in to something so much it sucks
The best you get is independent spins for a couple months
Before you bumped talking bout all the things in your past
But Andre told me boy you only funky as your last cut
And that's what keep me running like I got a target on my back cuz
One track won't last for the masses ask us
Where we gonna be in a few
I tell them I don't know but this what flows when I thought of you[Posdnuos/P-Pain]
What rhymes with shillin, villain
What rhymes with shmillain, villain
He's a villain..
Yes, he is..

[Kurious] + (Doom)
Set it off adrenaline rush, the boys way beyond a pen and the dutch
Stronger than hen a bag of the dust, you need to watch how they acting with us
Now time to get it in gear, get it in right here
Revenge is better than beer, Yo Doom, it's been a minute think they getting it clear (Yeah!)
When brothers reunite, make sure we party right
We rock it all night long even beyond the morning light
It's hard to see him in the light, even harder to see him on the mic
A black Benz beats being on a bike, and he can talk a gay chick outta being a dike
(New Kurious, y'all) Like that y'all, freak freak y'all (At a store near you)
To the beat y'all (Go get it)

[Doom]
Keep it on click fully auto, I won't stop the rock until pockets thick and gordo
More so a risk of sounding poor, bro
No tux ? who needs tickets to the award show
Normally cordial, more or less, less is more or no
Hock spit out the cockpit, stuck to the window 'till it's solid as a rock hit

[Posdnuos/P-Pain]
Yes, he is..

[Mobonix]
He grabbed the mic like two money bags
Waiting for the getaway to count what he had
Thought he was a spaz, but dude kept wrecking
The crowd remote control, keep 'em all guessing
Funny man gave 'em nuttin like a bummy dare
Taught him how to fight wit' a mic and the hottest stab
But that's the life of a villain, and you know after that, chilling
Went places got Gracie don't follow, the big joke ain't no Cola in the Coke bottle
Writing rhymes till the pen go hollow and been flow hotter than the sunshines of Marrow
And get the villain and scream, if it's not real life it's still in yo' dreams
Like that y'all, like that y'all, like that a like that and like that y'all

[Posdnuos/P-Pain]
What rhymes with thrillin, villain..
What rhymes with stealin, villain..
He's a villain..
Yes, he is..

[Prince Paul/Filthy Pablo]
..That's right, I'll smack the black off of ya, punk!

[Slug]
Villain..
Pushin' on the couch cushion, south side Minneap never lived out in Brooklyn
Kept the faith forget the fame
If they sweat the name let it set the lane
Held mind, cold and hard, had no regard who the chosen are
Who, you? Oh no, you played the Oboe, keep it on the low low
Rappers are candy butterscotch, I'mma let their baby mothers watch
She loves the ock, I touch the spot
Bitch, I'm the itch, that must've got up her crotch, heh
Now stop, fill the buildings
And leave some pills for these little villains
Hey shorty, share the flask
Let me explain why I wear this mask..

Villain!
"I want you to call me at that address if I'm still there
Gonna make sure you get cracked!"[Announcer]
Hi!! How's it goin alright fellas
Ladies and gents, welcome to a new edition of uhh
"Tap Talk USA" with your host..
Louis.. St. Ide's Donkey Dick, yeah
Today we will be interviewing my pal my good buddy uhh
Big Al

[Willy Scratch]
Willy Scratch, that's me, Willy Scratch!
I like to scratch my ass!

[Announcer]
How you doin Willy Scratch?
Well when the lemonade is on the line
And the milk is in the back pocket
And the burgers are on the floor
What do you like to do most?

[Willy Scratch]
Aww I scratch the two tumors in my BLOOMERS!
That's what I love to do, it's the best!
(JE-ZUS CHRIST!! BROTHER LOVE LOVES YOU)

[Announcer]
Ohh-kay, that's a little word
From our preacher over here on the right, but uhh
When the uhh shit hits the fan
And your uhh, tissue hits the hand
And you wipe the diarrhea and you put it in a pan
What do you come up with?

[Willy Scratch]
I get golden showers on my fucking asshairs
And on my mustache I wipe it in your glass! HAHAHA!
(Je-zus save you! BROTHER LOVE LOVES YOU)

.. "I wanna say a few words to you guys
That I've been thinking about backstage."

[Kurious]
Three cheers for my peers for the brew that I'm consumin
No knockin what I'm rockin cause my confidence is boomin
Sort of like a eight-oh-eight, but a fake note
Not (??) again loop, without a paid show
(Daaamn) Take a quick dip in my moat
Kurious the magician I'm laid back like dope
Or valium, or (??) be chillin like I wanna
A freezer full of 40's and a pocket full of scarma
Shit is on the verge to break
Throw on my fluffy white hat with a tendency to bake
Motherfuckers til they're cripsy, I mean fuckin BURNED
Bout time that you learned kid
Check what I did flip the lid of my brew
Givin a quip (??) a dollar or two
C.M. crew, rocks more pull than a ox
(Where can I check this out?) Fresh out the box

"Fresh out the box.." -] Run-D.M.C. {*scratched*}

[Kurious]
Check it out
No it doesn't take a sleuth, to know I'm hundred proof
I raise the fuckin roof, get looser than a tooth
In a, elderly's gums, I collect healthier sums
Of loot when I'm out drinkin with the bums
Pour in contributions, slide to the liquor spot
Brothers put their money on me cause I'm figured to rock
Yeah, with that shit that booms
Hoppin trains is a pain I maintain in the tombs
Crack the judge with a grudge, "I don't like Puerto Ricans"
Speakin on the Jones, made bail, and now I'm leapin and jumpin
True to the time, my shit is pumpin
Think you wanna talk? I'm dumb, I don't know nothin
Jack shit, suck a fat dick you fuckin bastard
I'm illy with the (??), drinkin wines gettin plastered
While you maintain, in your donut shops
Kids runnin with Glocks, fresh out the box

"Fresh out the box.." -] Run-D.M.C. {*scratched*}

[Kurious]
Uhhh, check it out
Dropper of the funk, not a beef initiator
Temperature's on, rise like the equator
Later for the bullshit, save the tip for the waiter
"Was the pussy good sir?" I don't know, I never ate her
Plant tabs on my tongue so my thoughts can grow
"Aiyyo your lyrics is corn," like the, one on my toe
To get with Kurious you gots ta keep on tryin son
And when it comes to fucks - nah I don't give a flyin one
If fucks had wings yo I'd be flyin forever
Pullin on a lover with her pet
A peacock lover dipped in ink, you're +Pretty in Pink+
Molly Ringwald got scald, the water in the sink
Was red hot -- OOPS, almost forgot
And if the honey look good, I walk her like a rott-
-weiler, I style her, in other words sport her
She tried to dig my pockets (BUS-TED) but yo I caught her
Sorta bugged ain't it? Dig the flow of the rhyme
You know the ho fainted when I showed her mine
Jumpin out the socks whether cotton or mesh
Guaranteed out the box, that my shit stay fresh

"Fresh out the box.." -] Run-D.M.C. {*scratched*}Yo Jorge, what's up, man?
Yo, I'm chillin, what's up, what's goin on, man?
	Yo, I'm coolin man, but I'm like worried about you, uknowmsayin?
Why you worried about me, man?
	Cause, yo man, you be drinkin a lot, you know
	Everytime I see you you got a 40
Nah man, I'm just chillin, knowmsayin?
	You're sure it's not girl problems, man?
Nah, ain't no girl problems, man, you buggin
	I don't know man, I don't know
	Come on, man, what's her name?

[ VERSE 1 ]
I don't sweat, no perspirational drip flip
Nope, the beat is dope, so acknowledge the tic
Toc of the clock, cause times are changing
Me sweatin girls, man, that's back in the days when
I was naive, kinda young, mighta even brung
Flowers to your door, but be damn sure
Those days are no more, so classify em as ancient history
Mysery was caused cause your wack way of thinkin
Breath stinkin cause I'm sittin here drinkin
A 40 gettin naughty, then my thoughts start linkin
Together, back-trackin, never was into girl-slappin
Releasin tension by grabbin the mic and rappin
Gifts with ribbons, when will this madness cease
You played me like a pair of Lee's with a permanent crease
All I ever wanted was for us to rock 'n roll
Ha-ha - Nikole

	Yeah, yeah, right
	Right, right, right
	Come on, man
	She got you goin, you know it, my man
	Yo, he sweatin her hard, man

[ VERSE 2 ]
I come back on a round-trip ticket from hell
But all's well, you see, I'm a survivor
Carnivore - you, played the role of
Never makin any attemps to show love
But that's okay, see, I'm not a first grader
Don't need attention, need not mention that I'm greater
So later for that, cause I'm not the type for braggin
Just like my jeans my self-esteem was saggin
Pick up a 40 or a six of the stout draught
My life was hittin, know what exactly I'm talkin about
The style that flips, the sips of the 40 ounce
To the bounce I got more, so I score
One thing's for sure: understand and comprehend
Before you play yourself like a trend I send
A little word of advice, Fisher Price toy I'm not
Man, I ain't a boy, thought you mighta forgot
The song I sing cause your ill mood swings low
Merry Christmas to a ho-ho-ho
Play the role of Santa Clause, so save the drama
Tell you straight up, just like I was from Alabama
You really need to start treatin people better
I regret the day I met her

Yo man
Y'all givin me a hard time
Leave me alone, I ain't sweatin her, man
	Aiyo Jorge, man, skeez' come a dime a dozen
	Ain't no need for you to be sweatin her love
	Go 'head and just kick it

Nikole
Nikole
Nikole
Nikole
Nikole	(4x)

Nikole, I got one more thing to say
Even if I never see another day
The games you play really taught me a lesson
All dressed up, but in disguise they were a blessin
So I say thanks, but now it's time for me to step
Kurious Jorge, you know you shoulda never slept
On me, but girl, you know that's not what I'm about
You're (wack) and I'm out

	Word!
	Yo, we outta here
	Word, let's be outta here
	Let's go to Sticky Mike's, man, uknowmsayin?
	Get some skins

[Intro: Dr. Doom]
My servants began to forge what was to become
The most dreaded costume on the face of the earth
The last thing to fit was the mask
Will it conform to my twisted features in comfort

[Verse 1: MF Doom]
He cleans his metal mask with gasoline, they after him
Last seen pulling chicks like a fiend pull a fast one
Can't put shit past him
Got niggas on his own team mad enough to blast him
Retarded in real life, on the mic Rain Man
Stand close to his main man like a chain gang
Who give a fuck about who or they fancy crew
That's no mystery that Hardy Boys do with Nancy Drew
Sorta with her drawers down quarter
The extorter bring slaughter like "Well I oughta"
I suggest you hand over the formula doula
A villain in your land, in his land a ruler
Hard hitting like puffing a woola with Lieutenant Uhura
Every day feel like it's an off day with Ferris Bueller
Brother pull heat to prove they not sweet
No matter how you spell it, we still got beats

[Verse 2: Kurious]
Don't question how we live, question what we give
Take it to the next leave 'em where they can't see me
Still they judge, but they be butt ass
Twist that wig like a muppet, keep it simple, can't truss it
Light's the fuel, mic is the tool
Drink Jack, kick back, drop jewel, finish what I start
Mastered the art, living hell can't explain it
Inhale confuse it more, cop the .44
Contemplate, meditate, dictate
I direct my direct fate, coming of late
Kurious, can I say shit
Do it for CottleRock, do it for K.Nit

[Verse 3: MF Doom]
By candlelight my hand will write these rhymes 'til I'm burnt out
Mostly from experience, shit that I learned about
Topics and views, generally concerned about
With different ways to come up and earn clout
I take a look at my life and pace the trails
From Tablik and savage females with fake nails to face veils
You out your frame but still bagging 'em too
You know I know, these hoes be asking me if I'm you
Like my twin brother, we did everything together
From hundred raka'at salats to copping butter leathers
Remember when you went and got the dark blue Ballys
I had all the different color Cazals and Gazelles
The "SUBROC" three-finger ring with the ruby in the "O", ock
Truly the illest dynamic duo on the whole block
I keep a flick of you with the machete sword in your hand
Everything is going according to plan man[Verse 1: Biolante/Kurious]
Only god is judge, never plea the case
Always aware of the truth we could never erase
Fallen from grace black North face
Ounce of green smoke, jack wit no chase
Peddle on the floor, thirsty for score, Fastlane
Destination: top of the cash game
Seek heat like a missle with mad aim
You can't blame
Missin spirits who campaign
A mystery at most, universal most stee is hot
Yup more often then not!
Vision clear like a Hindu with the third eye dot
We be weak...nah baby that's my word I got
Nuff rhymes, tuff times try talkin to kids
Who walk around thinkin that (God) doesn't forgive
Life in itself is like a bid
And if you scared to die then you scared to live
Ain't it a shame dealin with the remain
Hennessy on the brain, travel the plane

[Hook: Biolante]
Will the copy cats twist the def traps
Bliss the sex raps, blind to jet black
Matters awake in response since came to life
Singin a seance, escape the realm
Bly swift like 'o' at, fake jacks a cast
Catch two smacks, gentlemen relax
Blaze trails that haven't been traveled in a while
Scatter clues for those who equate the style

[Verse 2: Biolante]
Cruisin' in the Lex out the window seat
While I be trippin' off the rhyme, bop my head to the beat
I can't speak on delirious mood swings
True crowns, are handed to true kings
Tell ya take it back, straighten, money makin'
Vital sign: Awaken. Idle minds go to Satan
No debatin' on the vestle that we navigatin'
Gravitatin', schemin', leave 'em standin' waitin'
Specialize in futuristic mental picture paintin'
We are slave to sick ways, I'm quenchin' with thirst
Gift of a new day they seem like a curse
What we made, penetrate the charade
The incision is barely felt from the sharpness of the blade
Movin' motionless through this masquerade
Loomin' in the dark, but just to save a spark (Rock)
Like a match made in Heaven and Hell apart
But still one, if it's life we start
So real, reveal, sign is sealed
What we feels translates to meals
That 9-to-5 shit is no joke, muscle in
Scientist, but don't look upon my hustlin'

Three cheers for my peers for the brew that I'm consumin
No knockin what I'm rockin cause my confidence is boomin
Sort of like a eight-oh-eight, but a fake note
Not (??) again loop, without a paid show
(Daaamn) Take a quick dip in my moat
Kurious the magician I'm laid back like dope
Or valium, or (??) be chillin like I wanna
A freezer full of 40's and a pocket full of scarma
Shit is on the verge to break
Throw on my fluffy white hat with a tendency to bake
Motherfuckers til they're cripsy, I mean fuckin BURNED
Bout time that you learned kid
Check what I did flip the lid of my brew
Givin a quip (??) a dollar or two
C.M. crew, rocks more pull than a ox
(Where can I check this out?) Fresh out the box

"Fresh out the box.." -] Run-D.M.C. {*scratched*}

[Kurious]
Check it out
No it doesn't take a sleuth, to know I'm hundred proof
I raise the fuckin roof, get looser than a tooth
In a, elderly's gums, I collect healthier sums
Of loot when I'm out drinkin with the bums
Pour in contributions, slide to the liquor spot
Brothers put their money on me cause I'm figured to rock
Yeah, with that shit that booms
Hoppin trains is a pain I maintain in the tombs
Crack the judge with a grudge, "I don't like Puerto Ricans"
Speakin on the Jones, made bail, and now I'm leapin and jumpin
True to the time, my shit is pumpin
Think you wanna talk? I'm dumb, I don't know nothin
Jack shit, suck a fat dick you fuckin bastard
I'm illy with the (??), drinkin wines gettin plastered
While you maintain, in your donut shops
Kids runnin with Glocks, fresh out the box

"Fresh out the box.." -] Run-D.M.C. {*scratched*}

[Kurious]
Uhhh, check it out
Dropper of the funk, not a beef initiator
Temperature's on, rise like the equator
Later for the bullshit, save the tip for the waiter
"Was the pussy good sir?" I don't know, I never ate her
Plant tabs on my tongue so my thoughts can grow
"Aiyyo your lyrics is corn," like the, one on my toe
To get with Kurious you gots ta keep on tryin son
And when it comes to fucks - nah I don't give a flyin one
If fucks had wings yo I'd be flyin forever
Pullin on a lover with her pet
A peacock lover dipped in ink, you're +Pretty in Pink+
Molly Ringwald got scald, the water in the sink
Was red hot -- OOPS, almost forgot
And if the honey look good, I walk her like a rott-
-weiler, I style her, in other words sport her
She tried to dig my pockets (BUS-TED) but yo I caught her
Sorta bugged ain't it? Dig the flow of the rhyme
You know the ho fainted when I showed her mine
Jumpin out the socks whether cotton or mesh
Guaranteed out the box, that my shit stay fresh

"Fresh out the box.." -] Run-D.M.C. {*scratched*}* I'm Kurious!!! * (2X)
"I wanna know what's on your mind.."

[Kurious]
One two check, start the analysis
Why am I placed, in a situation wack as this?
Enquiring minds want to know; Kurious Jorge
Creativity from the mind and then so
At times I think I'm nice, clutch my genitalia
With the type of rhymes, that'll derail ya
Train of thought, 2-3 Uptown
On the iron horse, self esteem slows down
A humble type of fella, I count my blessings troop
But I'm countin more blessings than I count loot
Got a heart full of kindness, pocket full of lint balls
Everywhere I go yo, try and avoid the pitfalls (damn)
I understand, things don't come easy
Try to stay away from those who's sleazy
Ways portrays it reflects on the business
I wanna know (why Jorge?) cause I'm Kurious

* I'm Kurious!!! * (4X)
"I wanna know what's on your mind.."

[Kurious]
Am I to think I'm all that cause my rocket's on the rise?
(Hell no) With the surface, I still got ties
Besides what goes up, has got to come down
I know the day'll come when I'm broke and back around
My old block cool, cause I love everyone
From my man Big Tone on down to Little Damien
And then I'm thinkin of the past, remiscin on a 40
Alcoholism started back when I was shorty
I praise the Lord, my soul to keep
And think of how peaceful it is when I sleep
Cold lampin in my rest, all the stress and pain
Combination for success, razor and a vain?  (chill)
Maybe.. but my inner self saves me
Got me in control, when I'm feelin crazy
Peace to my mother, you know I love ya
And to my dog Sampson, I love you too

* I'm Kurious!!! * (4X)
"I wanna know what's on your mind.."

"On the streets, Kurious like Jorge!" -] Pete Nice

[Kurious]
Verse three rolls around, situation's brighter
Easin on the breaks, subject matter's lighter
Kurious Jorge, with a J not a G
A smooth flowin brother and I brought forth the
Style that flexes, from here to Texas
Don't own a Lexus, so opposite sexes
Commence to diss - why must you be material?
Dissed it cause I flipped it and I ate ya like cereal
Sex ain't literal, no clitoral stimulation
From the tongue, just a rhyme well brung
First class delivery like a Fed-Ex folder
As I look back in the days, I never was a
Casanova type brother, Valentino lover
Nor the fly guy but hey well I tried
Damn hard I must add, listen and trust dad
When he told me, "Yo Jorge, youse a cool mother.."

* I'm Kurious!!! * (7X)S-U-B, R-O-C
El Muerto Cucaracha to the highest degree

[Kurious]
Fresh out the box, in comes the loot
PSYCH cause it don't, I flaunt the tactic, climactic styles
No I won't go out the back like the vermin
I'm burnin, all sucker MC's whose hittin switches like Erick Sermon
Easier-rider provider of the old school shit
The tool gets hot when it's shot
Droppin shit on the mic, like faggots do in their drawers
When they see my silhouette, surprise, the props is yours
Blue light soars, speed to the heavens
Seperate your body from this piece of shit we live in
You're back to the essence we will always miss your presence
See you later in bliss, for now I leave ya with this..

{*horn break*}

[Kurious]
Anticipation of the groove makes me go RRRRAHH
Kurious the brainiest spontaneous, NAH
On the real Sub, tell me yo yo, why they be buggin?
They shoulders should be sore from the nuts that they be huggin
Never payin tolls, cause I don't own a car (worrrrd up)
Tell a bitch if she wanna bone a star
To ride my dick to the moon like a rocket
Already got a girl, bitch you need to stop it
My dog, I lock this up
I know you're laughin only wish that I could reach ya
If I get my shit correct, I'm guaranteed to meet ya
But you're back to the essence we will always miss your presence
See you later in bliss, for now I leave ya with this..

{*horn break*}

[Kurious]
You tell me, "Whattup Pops?" I say that's what Jordan got
You think I'm a superstar? Nah, can't afford a lot
Of shit cause my pockets is fucked
Welfare style, why smile? Here stops the bucks
Aww shit, make way for the prolific charismatic
Hispanic, Puerto Rican Cuban plus a functional addict
Rehabilitation is needed
Got soul cruise control at 55, never speeding
The ticket, you stick it, crevice, is anal
Try to match up parallel, and yo the pain will
Make you cringe, but the joint is dedicated
To my man up top, none other than Subroc
Takin time machine trips, go back and correct shit
Roughed up a beat, I freestyle on some next shit
You're back to the essence we will always miss your presence
See you later in bliss, for now I leave ya with this..

{*horn break*}[Sadat X]
Yeah, check this out, y'all, Sadat X, Mike G, Kurious Jorge
And the whole squad up in here, what? Listen, listen

I'm a do this right here for my main man Jorge
Said bring some old school, so I brought some leather Docs
Sadat X here, from the 120 blocks
In Harlem, uptown breeds stardom

[Mike G]
Mike G, JB's, puff the L, get ??? up the honey gets tuned up
Because the Jimmy had the dream to write the rhyme
Rip the beat up, that uptown shit will make you ampede up, yo yo

[Kurious]
Yo yo, get with this shit, it's the hit to make you fumble
Just a Nubian Constipated Monkey in the Jungle
Humble rap, peep the thermostat, shit be hot
Kurious the magician got a mansion and a yacht

[Hook]
We came to rock it, don't stop it
Because the party has begun
So come on females get on the dance floor
And the fellas have some fun

[Kurious]
Ah check it out, my dimetion's esquisite, I invite you to visit
Is it the shit that I be doing, brewing in your crew with my rhyme blizzard
Hit you in the head can't stop it
Dropping jewels like a thief with a hole in his pocket

[Mike G]
No doubt remedies antidotes cutthroats choke
]From her be hands hitting your throat, don't front check your coat
We came to have a ball, Sadat X on point
Mick make your call

[Sadat X]
It's like water clear flows, the group that I take
Can't be taken by a softball heads and low cuts
]From the prime stock ??? around the block
Rarely weed smoking, never catch the pocket dred
Mine be line with the thing for the head, it's like that, yo

[Hook]
We don't wanna be left behind
All we wanna do is just blow your mind
We don't wanna be left behind
All we wanna do is just blow your mind
Just one more time

[Sadat X]
Here we go like this, check it
It's getting late and I'm a burst
I gotta get uptown to my own compound
Give a call to my lady, heat up the dinner
Hey Jorge you know how we do, I'm a see you in a few
Mike G, my man, it was great
Peace to New York State, and hard working New Yorkers
Step on the trash talkers slid on a pair of British Walkers
Sadat X I got the fright of pride
My shit is hot, kid think not?
]From Melrose to Patterson, Lexington to Madison
Mecca on 8, the 45th on the corner
All getting props, the kid with black Nike high tops
The veteran of the 4 train strain
I like to rhyme but the ??? in the rain

[Mike G]
Come on, taste it don't waste it
It's gonna catch it, just face it
New York connect make you do a head check
But now go and get pet
Because the crowd is select K. Jorge
Made out the touch tone, mad sessions was done, bones
Hypertone, blown headphones it feels good
The flow's endless, torturous, feel full bless
I hold my firece, K. Jorge rip the mic
Til the beat is dismissed like that y'all

[Kurious]
Well I was walking through the jungle with a stick in my hand
And if bland is how it stands right according to plan
We be getting iller, Manilla, now we provide the thriller
Watch a Constipated Monkey pound his chest like a gorilla
Nowadays people praise be bugging
Think I got mad loot, it's sad, I'm glad, fuck what you think
I'm cute, whatever, but if you was clever
You'd know I'm broker than the brokest and I'm uglier than ever
Precise like ice, I slid in cool
Big Cotta, Lord Sear, Prince from Powerule
Highly pleasurable, like having sex
I'm cracking Becks with Mike G, playing Madam with X

"Don't stop rocking to the rhythm cause I get down" (Repeat til fade)[MF Doom]
This is a public service announcement
Be careful
It could be a warning (it is a warning)
Watch out for the mild mannered
You need to be careful
Safety first
The streets ain't no joke like that
You might see him with a small attire coming out of your neck

Get caught like.. Klaow!! Well then, there now
Blaow, outta nowhere, the dunce couldn't prepare for how
Got scripts, whipped up all the quicker
The one who came to the party, sipped up all the liquor
Who they gonna stick the blame to, that he came through?
With this verse to name a few, tame a shrew, shame you
When he spit, the phlegm grapple
This type a script cats don't like, like them apples
Yes Lord. Track sorta like a chessboard
Even better than having a motorcycle escort
Allow me to retort and do my thing
Metal Face ho's with tongue and ‘o’ lease eye ring
Greased lightning from the flow pro-trainer
Who remains on the slow, this one a no-brainer
Like blow in a strainer - hold the mic like a handle
A distress to damsels, a piss test vandal
We all do dumb stuff like rappers act psycho
Press the wrong switch and get your shit crushed like Geico
Out to get Rich like Little Old Roundtree
From fist to the stitch of the gun he sold brown tree
How y'all found me? A penny sure goes far
This one goes out to you know who you are
Got many more rhymes in jars like plenty more
Whore war stars that's twenty four bars

[Kurious]
Drinkin', fuckin' for days straight, wait, this a hazy state
Rhyme is on time but, I'm five minutes late
It’s like Tutankhamen, or a kid graffiti bombin
The Hieroglyphical Bin Laden
Twisted your shit, pardon (Fuck you!)
That’s the movie that we started
Bitches don’t get a dime, see me I ain't doin' time
At least for no dumb shit, continue to climb
Like a small-talk rhetoric character’s been on my nerves the whole time
I fall back, lookin at me funny
Psst, bitch I’m all that –
Remember, pull a chrome hatchet on that ass and yell "Timber"
I ain't the player prayer, just a fuckin member
People buggin' "Kurious, where ya been? I heard he rocks"
Beatin' (???) sinkin craps with city cops
Clip your balls and put 'em inside a birdy box
And trade a bottle of Cristal in, bitch, 30 shots

[King Geedorah]
No one overstands, it ain't nuttin sweet yo
They need to go back down to Earth with Dennis Tito (space cadet)
”The flow is really neato” said the street ho
He said “I already know.. but how you like the beat though?”
(Ow Ow)
Use your better judgment
Pockets stay pungent - ask him where the budget went
We got receipts like Jeats
In these mean streets that stomp like cleats
He couldn't have it any other which way
One thing he do know is they flows is itchbay
These is like Old Bay on steak fries
Stay foldin fake guys, stay rollin snake eyes
Flip quicker than Woody Wood Pecker would
Either in the hood, or peckerwood neck of the woods
Like, like out in these here parts
Cause King Geedorah puts fear in they hearts
Don't dare start"Why do you keep smoking that shit? Why will you keep smoking that shit?
Why??? Why??? Why do you keep smoking that shit?"

Aight, check it out yo, check it out yo
I'mma flip yo, check it out - bust it

[Zev Love X]
I connect to spots like connect-the-dots
From the Lower East Side, to way up top
I got a map too, express on the 6, I found you
Where they got the raw dog smoke at Soundview
Now, two nicks damnit, do you understand?
Nuff respect to the dread man or I'mma dead man
I ain't no fake man for the red hand
It's just my Walkman with instructions from Redman
Whomever I step to, remove the Phillie filter
Cause I used to know this bitch and it killed her (that bitch is dead)
I'm smokin that shit, cause I got a thousand jokes
Like puttin your moms in the yoke cause she broke some choke
Bitch, you're blowin up the spot, be out
Yo either get some dough, or get the fuck down South
With your bitch-ass son, and tell him throw up his dukes
So I can spend his lunch loot at noop noop

[Kurious]
Check it
I do the hip, hop, the hibby, the hibby dibby
Kurious the too-fly magician, never givin
These niggas a piece of my pie, cause yo my shit is fat
Just like my pockets your girl's titties is flat
So when the bitch slid in correct with the funk from the big bra
I kindly reply, with a smile, aiyyo chill hooooot damn
Uh uh uh, I'm so sorry uhh
Eat your tits, cause them shits is from Somalia
Check it out, on the one to the two
It's some shit from the zoo, it's the C.M. crew
Now from the cocks with the blocks on the street or the goat
With the 40, the Glocks, the Phillie and the smoke
Just like George Bush is the type to drop bombs
George Kemprias will smoke scarm wit'cha moms
Throw a 50 yard pass, with a afro pick
To Steve, Earthquake, stop smokin that shit

[Earthquake]
I keep my gun out my holster, I'm wanted on the poster
Cause I shot the sheriff who knocked the cherry off my shoulder
He tried to get cute, so Earthquake, had to erase him
And place him, in America's Top Ten, like Casey Kasem
I tracked him, an actor, with no sense of humor
If you heard I fell off nigga, it's only just a rumor
So step the fuck back, 'fore you get your shit cracked
I had to think up a plan, so now I'm fat like that
280 pounds of pure funk, and no junk
I snatch a ho bitch up, just like Dave, did The Chipmunks
Kid I'm rough tough, strong enough to call your bluff
Handcuff your wife up, while your bitch, give me a buff
I do run run run, I do run the MC's
The king of rap, you don't believe me? Believe these!
Def rhymes on wax, don't call me, send a fax
I slam hard like Anthrax, so turn it up to the max
STOP! You're pinchin my nerves, with rap slurs
I do my best herb, now it's time to get served
So suck my dick, I don't smoke that shit
I don't want this shit, so you flip the script

[Hook]
You know I'm on that shit - STOP SMOKIN THAT SHIT
You know I'm on that shit - STOP SMOKIN THAT SHIT
I'm always always on that shit - STOP SMOKIN THAT SHIT
Yeah I'm on that shit - STOP SMOKIN THAT SHIT

[Verse Four]
Stop smokin that shit, 'fore you get killed
You know the flavor my man, so just chill
Now hold your head up and hold your head high
Stop smokin the dust, you just might die
Relax your mainframe, the bolder gets paid
And you won't have no motherfuckin {?}
As you know, I'm on the microphone to make you all know
That shit that you smoke will make you mad broke
I don't give a fuck about you and your crew
I'm not too love sick, drink that brew I'm a Nancy Drew
I don't solve mysteries, never wearin Lees
I got the motherfuckin S.I. to be, where it seed
So pack up, my man I went out of breath
I got asthma on the side, take it on to the left
So stop smokin that shit my man
And I'm out, see ya later, so kick the can

[Subroc]
I drink Colt 45 and talk in mad jive
You know I stay alive, my niggas stay alive
Easy on the smoke, I don't really feel like tokin
I gotta save some breath for this bitch I be strokin
Everyday I make a nigga get right
Jealous-ass, pussy-ass nigga can't fight
I'm in my new disguise, feedin pigeons
Ducks, any bird, and bond's my word (word is bond)
I make gadgets, illy, ill toys that kill
Sleep on me, you'll get a sleepin pill
Pin that nigga, down right on the mat (bang!)
If you ain't my nigga, don't reach for no gat
Slap, right to the head
I'm blitzed to whip that ass, {?} style, dead
Y'knahmsayin?

[Outro]
SMOKIN THAT SHIT
Yeah, c'mon - SMOKIN THAT SHIT
You see a nigga you know - SMOKIN THAT SHIT
My man you're cold - SMOKIN THAT SHIT
Kurious Jorge I know you're not - SMOKIN THAT SHIT
Zev Love what you doin? SMOKIN THAT SHIT
Stop SMOKIN THAT SHIT, stop SMOKIN THAT SHIT
Hahaha, smokin that motherfuckin shit!
Word up, yeah yeah, smokin that shit
Smokin that motherfuckin shit, you're motherfuckin right
Put the fuckin pipe down!![Posdnuos/P-Pain]
What rhymes with shillin, villain
What rhymes with shmillain, villain
He's a villain..
Yes, he is..

[Kurious] + (Doom)
Set it off adrenaline rush, the boys way beyond a pen and the dutch
Stronger than hen a bag of the dust, you need to watch how they acting with us
Now time to get it in gear, get it in right here
Revenge is better than beer, Yo Doom, it's been a minute think they getting it clear (Yeah!)
When brothers reunite, make sure we party right
We rock it all night long even beyond the morning light
It's hard to see him in the light, even harder to see him on the mic
A black Benz beats being on a bike, and he can talk a gay chick outta being a dike
(New Kurious, y'all) Like that y'all, freak freak y'all (At a store near you)
To the beat y'all (Go get it)

[Doom]
Keep it on click fully auto, I won't stop the rock until pockets thick and gordo
More so a risk of sounding poor, bro
No tux ? who needs tickets to the award show
Normally cordial, more or less, less is more or no
Hock spit out the cockpit, stuck to the window 'till it's solid as a rock hit

[Posdnuos/P-Pain]
Yes, he is..

[Mobonix]
He grabbed the mic like two money bags
Waiting for the getaway to count what he had
Thought he was a spaz, but dude kept wrecking
The crowd remote control, keep 'em all guessing
Funny man gave 'em nuttin like a bummy dare
Taught him how to fight wit' a mic and the hottest stab
But that's the life of a villain, and you know after that, chilling
Went places got Gracie don't follow, the big joke ain't no Cola in the Coke bottle
Writing rhymes till the pen go hollow and been flow hotter than the sunshines of Marrow
And get the villain and scream, if it's not real life it's still in yo' dreams
Like that y'all, like that y'all, like that a like that and like that y'all

[Posdnuos/P-Pain]
What rhymes with thrillin, villain..
What rhymes with stealin, villain..
He's a villain..
Yes, he is..

[Prince Paul/Filthy Pablo]
..That's right, I'll smack the black off of ya, punk!

[Slug]
Villain..
Pushin' on the couch cushion, south side Minneap never lived out in Brooklyn
Kept the faith forget the fame
If they sweat the name let it set the lane
Held mind, cold and hard, had no regard who the chosen are
Who, you? Oh no, you played the Oboe, keep it on the low low
Rappers are candy butterscotch, I'mma let their baby mothers watch
She loves the ock, I touch the spot
Bitch, I'm the itch, that must've got up her crotch, heh
Now stop, fill the buildings
And leave some pills for these little villains
Hey shorty, share the flask
Let me explain why I wear this mask..

Villain!
"I want you to call me at that address if I'm still there
Gonna make sure you get cracked!"[Verse 1: Kurious]

[Verse 2: The Audible Doctor]

We've been holding this up for years and ya'll can't even raise your hands
Like you in class embarrassed in front of your peers
I'm done dumbing it down son, the sound you hear
Was designed to avoid leaving a void between your ears
And while they toying with my fears I be destroying every stage that I stand on
And planned on this as my career
Except it seems that no matter where my dreams at with these cats
It's more about a fad than a fan that can hear
The true meaning, I've been through feuds with a few demons
Leaving worn down souls/soles like shoes leaning
Believe it
You semen/see men spit like hoes without the kleenex
And then wonder why the seeds hit the cement
Out in the street with nobody to teach kids
Stop buying that weak shit support something decent
I preach this
And each and every time you reach for a record
Be sure you check for the B-B-A-S bitch respect it
They ain't listening
I grip the pen tight and write till blisters end the session
Sending tension up my tendons just to represent
I've gotten ill at this, I don't mean that I'm nice
I mean I've literally gotten sick from staying up nights
Just trying to write and make beats for weeks at a time
He's tight but he can't speak over beats when he's dying
And it's trying his emotions that nobody know his name
He's just in it for the rent and utilities fuck the fame
It's a shame how you put your love in to something so much it sucks
The best you get is independent spins for a couple months
Before you bumped talking bout all the things in your past
But Andre told me boy you only funky as your last cut
And that's what keep me running like I got a target on my back cuz
One track won't last for the masses ask us
Where we gonna be in a few
I tell them I don't know but this what flows when I thought of you[Kurious]
Kurious sparks the buddha, shit act like you knew the
The game fuck the fame shit is lame rather do the
Bump bumpety bump with a stuntety stunt
Don't forget my name bitch, I got what you want
Can't front on the man known to say "Yea yea"
It's the Puerto Rican wonder motherfucker don't stare
If you're vision's 20/20 best believe
I got plenty for that ass -- ha ha, you know the steelo
Kilos ain't flipped so my ass is broke
Catch me on two-five, steamin' the choke
Like the sauna word is bond I, step to a hoochie
That's the word for it, try to kick it honey diss me
I ignore it, sorta like a wall that's dense
Bitch think a nigga's rich, it don't make sense
Little brother The Omen hit up some shit that's fit
Represent for the peeps on some Uptown Shit

[Hook] repeat 2X
Yo it's the Uptown Shit - it's the Uptown Shit
Check the Uptown Shit - strictly Uptown Shit
Yo it's the Uptown Shit - it's the Uptown Shit
Check the Uptown Shit - strictly Uptown Shit

[The Omen]
Yeah! Skull snaps now I'm the pimp
Comin' straight, it's The Omen with that Uptown Shit
Stride's kinda humble, stays cool with the strut
Graze a big butt, I step back, then I nut
Damn! I wish I got to butt fuck the bitch
I flip with a twitch, pulls a nigga that's rich
So, I steps cool, acts like I know
Step to the block and join in some cee-lo
I roll 6-6-6 with the tricks cause it's fixed
Your head is banged so I got you in the mix
I spit the pulp like a pit
Now I'm leavin you.. on some Uptown Shit

[Kadi]
Ha ha, check me out as the third introduct
Niggas talkin the lip, but I don't give a fuck
It's the Uptown Shit, where honeys shake their hips
And the fellas try to dip, in the Miracle Whip
One time it's the Rican with the low haircut
With the bitches that fuck, then swallow the nut
Straight facts from a cat who will give you the scoop
I be Knockin more Boots than that H-Town group
So give me mine Poppa Duka when I race your Koopa Troopa
In a Mario Kart, niggas dread me from the start
Don't fuck around kid if you ain't prepared
Cause a nigga whose scared, is a nigga who ain't there!

[Hook]

[Kurious]
Check it out
There it is, hear the sound, got a blunt, bust me down
Forty-five, no St. Ides, it's the wines that I dine
Chickenhead shit is dead, you're gettin me fed
Slide up the block I hear, "WHATTUP KID?"
Yeah yeah, Kurious, save the mess for the rest
Known for takin buddha sess, straight to the chest
Slide to the rucka every week's the same
Strictly checkin' for ass, motherfuck the game
Pysch, I sneak a peak at my main man Tone
Only bitches I sweat, is the bitches that bone
Puffin on a loose bitch exhale fast
I throw my dick in your mouth
Have you blowin' rings out your fuckin ass..
.. til it's time to quit
Whattup to Big Trey on some Uptown Shit

[Hook, with variations]Ah yeah
It's the fat joint right here
Here we...
This joint right here is dedicated to
Well, I'm not malicious
But all those whose words vicious
Talkin behind the back
This shit is wack

Here we go
You need to walk like a duck (walk like a duck)
Walk like a duck (walk like a duck)
You need to walk like a duck (walk like a duck)
Say what? (Like a muthafuckin duck!)
You need to walk like a duck (walk like a duck)
Walk like a duck (walk like a duck)
You need to walk like a duck (walk like a duck)
Yo Jorge, how do ducks walk?

Check it
[ VERSE 1 ]
Kurious was never one for ring around
The rosie, not Josey, but I mosey on down
To a meadow where the flowers stay wilted
So what I ain't hit as many skins as Wilt the Stilt did
It's like that, never labelled a wack
And yo, they choose behind my back to do the Duckville quack
My style is cool, sweet like a ???
But still (what?) you gossip like a bitch
Mental stimulation when I'm rollin with the rat pack
If you're frontin rock, get the doodoo out your knap sack
The fat track provided by the Beat' got you goin
'nuts kickin butts, underneath be when I'm flowin
I'm knowin, you frontin-ass ducks is gettin smeared
My crew rolls thick like a hillbilly's beard
Constipated Monkeys gettin to the point quick
Like my man Apache said: yo, get off (MY DICK!)

[ VERSE 2 ]
It's like that and - ah
Didn't go to Georgia, took the train to Alabama
On the midnight tip like Gladys Knight and the Pips
My sole intention bein to move the marrow in your hips
Family confusion's what motivates the rhymer
Got an aunt named Tom, uncle named Jemima
Kurious Jorge on the welfare line
Plus American Airline never prepared mine
Ears for the poppin, hands for the clappin
If I sense turbulence, commence to see the captain
Two strikes, your motion got a notion of funk
I must prescribe a mint (why?) cause your breath stunk
(Ill) I paid the bills, sent a check to my mama
If you try to wreck my mind, there's mad drama
I'mma deliver one worm for the hawk
Eliminatin quacks on the duck walk

[ VERSE 3 ]
I drop limes like I drop mescaline
Tabs on my tongue as I swung from the swing
And came up with that thing they call 'Walk Like a Duck'
Quite frankly don't give a fuck
Mama raised me humble, so I never ever label
Myself as the best, cause some of the rest got more flavor
But that's okay, beyond a shadow of a doubt
I got skills, I ain't conceited, but still might take you out
Half Puertorican, half Cuban, not Fidel
Castro, like an astro you know I excel
Time to sell mad units, scratchin on my pubics
Complicate confusion like a ?Nick Kubrick? on a Rubik
Who kicks the bubbles that allow the truth to surface?
I never will delete, so I don't defeat the purpose
Slapshot the gift like a hockey puck
Ha-ha, you fuckin duckVerse 1: Pete Nice

3 blind, see how the run
Schemin on the corner, Puerto Rican, black and white the one
Risin each day, the conflicts of culture
Hopeless the racist, he rip you like a vulture
Sippin on the wines, cause it eases off the mindset
All shades of color owe the other one respect
Master of another, mad discrimination
Yo, they used to play him at the corner bus station
Back in the days in the backs of the busses
Dealin with the devil and his deragotory cusses
White cracker man called the other man a nigger
Swingin on a slugger like a baseball swinger
Swing batter, swing, but that's a cavalier thing
When you reminisce on Rodney King
You see, it's hard to keep a good man down dead last
So the black mouse smoked up some white ass

Chorus:

	3 blind mice see how they run, y'all (Repeat 3x)
	When they're lookin down the barrel of a shotgun

Verse 2: Pete Nice

White mousetrap'll keep you under in the ghetto
Livin and what you do, the drinkin 40s, shootin celo
Always on a mission, out to dominate the other
Got the go-for-self-vibe, always dickin down his brother
Now the mouse is out on his way to public school
Act a fool, classmates pack shanks and pack tools
It's not the old twist of Crabtree and Weezer
50 in a class with the underpaid teacher
Textbook straight out the 60s
Pebble off the rocks, pull a pocket full of 50s
If he got papes out his ass, yo, what do we need a book for
Busted in a month, and you don't know what to look for
Victim of the system, and you're fallin off real quick
Try to beat the system, and they have you suck the man dick
The mouse just tryina put the grub on his plate
But in reality a blind man hates

Chorus x4

Verse 3: Benz

3 blind mice, they on the 20 steppin
The difference between the 3 is that the black mouse got a weapon
Schemin on robbin, but ain't his own kind
Anybody with a lighter pigment catches the nine
He thinks he's a rebel, he's flipped all the levels
Cause he was taught to always see the white man as a devil
That's how he was taught and brought up as a youth
As far as the black mouse goes, this is the truth
He pulled out a gun, the white mouse starts to run
He said, "If you don't stop, then come to get done"
The white mouse stopped, and it wasn't even funny
The black mouse shot him after he took all the money

Verse 4: Kurious Jorge

Hey yo, mouse number 3 had on a hoodie and jeans
The cracker called him 'spick', cause he eats the rice and beans
Never understoood for what all the discrepancy
Never went to jail convincted of a felony
It's kinda funny, his gear was rather bummy
But he never stole a penny, even when he needed money
The high school suspension, forgot to mention
In a black and white world, he don't get that much attention
Rumours, rats, the roaches, and the welfare
16 in the house, and they share the same underwear
Stereotypes, but he likes the pure potent
Wines, what you find soon enough, a dead rodent

Chorus x2Tune in your sets
(Spark your cigarettes)
You don't need cable TV
(Just a window to see) Who, me?
The Kurious one in your backyard
(Monkey bars I'm swingin on)
(Check it)

[ VERSE 1 ]
Okay, time period 5 B.C
5 years before money and crack was a priority
(Authority) figures loomin like dark skies
(Sittin in class, second hand movin clock wise)
Patiently waitin for the bell to ring (ring)
There it is, I gather my things
(Backpack over my shoulder, like a soldier I troop)
Uptown, sportin a frown (cause you're wearin a corny suit)
I metamorphasize from the shirt and ties
(What else?) laces in shoes ain't fly (it's a pack of lies)
Hm - now that's more likely
Pumas, mocknecks (and maybe like a pair of Lee's)
Yeah, I feel fantastic
Sneak out the house cause mama's rules was mad drastic
("Boy, stay in the house," she says)
"Yo mom, no disrespect
And jetted out the door, you know that I jet
(Real quick outside) so I could be among
Yeah, my friends, how I miss bein young

	Jorge, Jorge, Jorge of the projects		(repeated)

[ VERSE 2 ]
Fun years are over (and now here comes)
A period of time, respect is measured in lump sums
Of money (drugs, thugs are cool)
Word up, chumps get slung (kids droppin outta school
Girls add fuel to the fire if you're a bum)
Word up, bottomline is: (kid, you're gettin none)
(No play at all) cause they want Shirlings
Fat bangle bracelets (the matching earrings)
Brothers, they be fallin victim to the trickin
The life is finger lickin good (just like the chicken)
Don't count em all (word up, until they hatch)
The story sounds good (shit, but there's a catch)
Jorge (Jorge of the projects)
Made the choice to gain material objects
(Pushin Ac Legends up the block)
Stock is on the rise (from the flip of a rock)
So he chills (in the fat-ass joint)
Point fingers (favors linger in the mind)
He got his (and you know I got mine)
But for now it's about that time

Check it out

	Jorge, Jorge, Jorge of the projects		(repeated)

Humble, t-t-tumblin down (word up, the shit which allows)
Someone to be a nice guy (Kurious Jorge)
Tell ya straight, respect (to my mother) like no other
(Cause I love you to death)
Trife (project life) yeah you might say that
Murder crimes and (drugs) man, they're goin way back
When (some by the pen straight out the ghetto)
(Expose the hate) but try to be a kind fellow
Still mellow is the trait I choose to uphold
(By means a peace died) . 45 (now hold)
(Go) Aiyo, Amp, spark the biff
(Come on, Jorge, what you be meanin?) Dummy - the fat spliff
(I guess times are great, so celebrate the celebration)
Word up, vacation from the projects (cause the object is inflation)
Of my bank book (which you don't have)
Shut up, cause maybe some day (sure you'll have a whole lot of money)
(Aiyo, honey, no need to change the topic)
Word up, and Jorge'll be Jorge (Jorge of the projects)

	Jorge, Jorge, Jorge of the projects		(repeated)Yo Jorge, what's up, man?
Yo, I'm chillin, what's up, what's goin on, man?
	Yo, I'm coolin man, but I'm like worried about you, uknowmsayin?
Why you worried about me, man?
	Cause, yo man, you be drinkin a lot, you know
	Everytime I see you you got a 40
Nah man, I'm just chillin, knowmsayin?
	You're sure it's not girl problems, man?

Nope, the beat is dope, so acknowledge the tic
Toc of the clock, cause times are changing
Me sweatin girls, man, that's back in the days when
I was naive, kinda young, mighta even brung
Flowers to your door, but be damn sure
Those days are no more, so classify em as ancient history
Mysery was caused cause your wack way of thinkin
Breath stinkin cause I'm sittin here drinkin
A 40 gettin naughty, then my thoughts start linkin
Together, back-trackin, never was into girl-slappin
Releasin tension by grabbin the mic and rappin
Gifts with ribbons, when will this madness cease
You played me like a pair of Lee's with a permanent crease
All I ever wanted was for us to rock 'n roll
Ha-ha - Nikole

I come back on a round-trip ticket from hell
But all's well, you see, I'm a survivor
Carnivore - you, played the role of
Never makin any attemps to show love
But that's okay, see, I'm not a first grader
Don't need attention, need not mention that I'm greater
So later for that, cause I'm not the type for braggin
Just like my jeans my self-esteem was saggin
Pick up a 40 or a six of the stout draught
My life was hittin, know what exactly I'm talkin about
The style that flips, the sips of the 40 ounce
To the bounce I got more, so I score
One thing's for sure: understand and comprehend
Before you play yourself like a trend I send
A little word of advice, Fisher Price toy I'm not
Man, I ain't a boy, thought you mighta forgot
The song I sing cause your ill mood swings low
Merry Christmas to a ho-ho-ho
Play the role of Santa Clause, so save the drama
Tell you straight up, just like I was from Alabama
You really need to start treatin people better
I regret the day I met her

Yo man
Y'all givin me a hard time
Leave me alone, I ain't sweatin her, man
	Aiyo Jorge, man, skeez' come a dime a dozen
	Ain't no need for you to be sweatin her love
	Go 'head and just kick it

Even if I never see another day
The games you play really taught me a lesson
All dressed up, but in disguise they were a blessin
So I say thanks, but now it's time for me to step
Kurious Jorge, you know you shoulda never slept
On me, but girl, you know that's not what I'm about
You're (wack) and I'm out

Snake charmer, bringing to life
Like the candelabra, sing it tonight
Emerge from the dust, watching it rise
Celebrate the life and watch when it dies

[Verse 1]
Only to begin again
Ever change, still the same
Ocean tides throwing him off-course, still a game
Still in chains, freedom ring
Bells delayed, see him sing
Freedom song, only when he finds he doesn't need a thing
Damn, shit is complicated
Hearts getting confiscated
Jorge, take a pill and chill
Never over-complicated
Laugh out hysterically
Kurious pedigree
Top dog, monkey man
Putting it down legibly
Come correct, spot check
All right, it better be
Lot of nerve -- don't ever put them weak dudes next to me
Watch a few good souls refuse desperately
Never no agenda, services to render
Never no pretender, benefits to the sender
Gifts is in the giving
Riffs to make a living
Lesson learned on land that was stolen on Thanksgiving
New York's a playground, shouts out to San Quentin
Bendi song with all due respect
Bendi song the bill collector-slash-Pied Piper-skill-perfector
Umbrella, expand, catch some shade
Under the real protector
Take a deep breath, feel the pressure
Ah, on the exhale, tap the next nail
Seal the coffin; hope they get paid real often
Maybe all is just a dream
Paint a sea, see struggle
Leaks out his whole heart
Feel his veins bleed puddles
Now he's composed again
Chill like a frozen wind
? foes, ? and so it begins
Forty days, forty nights traveling across the sand
Awake like a motherfucker, like he high off a gram
Wish it would rain, eyes peeled on the thermostat
Muy caliente, he could feel the burns on his back
Learned the facts journeying
Moving like a meteor
Him and King Geedorah
Like it's the last beer call"Spell it with a J, and not with a G" (8X)

[Kurious]
Time's up, WHAT? Trey, push me back on the
Rhyme tip to flip, use a nine and a clip
Release date fate's in my hands not yours
BEATNUT TRACKS -- shakes ya drawers
Holdin back the rhymin, time is of the essence
Single file line, participate the presence
Of the Puerto Rican humble never over-exert
Half-Cuban, type brotha, got styles, jerk!
Reclining on the scene, do it with ease
Don't like tools, cool like the breeze
Funky mic holder never was a Casanova
Pulled her over told her, baby I'm much older so
"Come and talk to me I only wanna, check, you girl
I don't wanna, know your name"
Kickin the style Kadi wassup? (Stop, that shit is lame!)
YES, YES JORGE! -- What? Fuck it get right
Puttin fuel in the torch, with a style that ignite
All ducks to the left when I'm pitchin my tent
Spanish speakers -- REPRESENT!

Chorus: Kurious and Beatnuts

[All] YES, YES JORGE! Gotta give em what they want
[All] YES, YES JORGE!

"Spell it with a J, and not with a G"

(repeat 2X)

[Kurious]
I do the dip dip dive, so so socialize
Bang, your buddha highs puts the smoke in my eyes
Malt liquor got me trapped, my rap is controversial
Might drink the brew, but won't do no commercial
Rehearsal is top speed, comin in at a higher rate
Took care of my pupils, now it's time for my pockets
To dilate -- drink mad fluid with the crooks
When I drop tabs like ads in the Billboard books
I'm seein right through ya, YEAH
Bout time you hit the door -- glad I knew ya
In other words, Herb, slide to the side
Hey Mary if you're down to J. then I o-Blige
NO TRICKIN -- business got my head in the Yo!
(Yo Jorge I seen your video) Pssh, whattup bro?
Understand the style when it's time to freak the funk
All I got is critics in my ear that's poppin junk
Just like Levi's, you need to ZIP
Your lip up rhymes when it's time to flip
Hit it up quick - like a ball and a bat
Til it's time to slide, LIKE THAT

Chorus

"Spell it with a J... and not with a G" (4X)

[Kurious]
You say, "OK, you spell it with a J, Kurious
You're kinda cool, tell me what you're tryin to say"
I had you Walkin Like a Duck, slow and steady now I'm ready
To make you Zoom-a-Zoom Zoom, Shake your Rump like Teddy
YES, YES JORGE -- WHAAAAH! Hearin the yells
The two fly magicians, castin mad spells
Kids buggin, bodies in wells
Prefer to lay back, twist caps and spark L's
? crew, hardhead style, never quittin
You ask the question why the country western shit is hittin
Secret lies within the stringes of the uke-lele
Then I sail these serpent seas to Cuba and parley
Chill, max, smoke a cigar
You need to Walk Like a.. yeah, you know who you are
Pack my bags, now I'm out to St. Croix
Cool latin brother could never be a pretty boy
Girls still be frontin (why?) don't even ask it
I still get head, like a guillotine basket
You bastard -- just kiddin, jokes is what I'm written
My ? ? -- DON'T DRIVE DRUNK -- I'm skiddin
Back on track, chill around the way
Kurious signin off, spell it with a J

Stay High
So you could start your day right
Stay High
So you could have a good night
Stay High
You can always shine bright

BRIDGE
How high can you go 4x

Verse 1
All soured up febreeze
Do it with such ease something like a disease
Doc emergency got my head in the trees
All covered in funk knock em dead then I breeze
Remnants of leaves, stalks, and bamboo
Ain't no limitations of what we can do
Parallel to puffy purple clouds of smoke
And the rhyme style that jumps out and grabs your throat
Invite your lady friend take a ride on a boat
All aboard bamboo fresh I quote
Style is ice classified sedative
Benchmark is the best but its all relative
We relatives what it is its best to give
Without even acknowledging death its best to live
Yes it is
Hey Hey

HOOK

BRIDGE

Verse 2
Now you can see the Norther Lights from the Heights
And the county of Kings plus bounty it brings
But you don't have to get high to feel fly
Don't rely on a thing, don't rely on a thing
I feel strong just like a diesel engine
Bench pressing stress, defeat tension
Release tension
Not to mention
Another way to reach that high is when you're sexing
Natural
Climax crescendo
Imax, nintendo, play stay 360
We rock a show, perform and get doe
Don't wast potential
Its monumental
When they legalize budd, i'll have a pocket full of fuzz
But I get the greatest buzz when my sun gives me a hug
Kiss and high five

So what you do is you uh, open your motherfuckin ears
And check this shit out
And if you can't dig it, then break the fuck out, uhh!

[Kurious]
Kurious the magician hits the podium like a public speaker
Highly energized, (??) boricua
Strictly representin for my people Spanish speakin
Shit got you groovin, half-Cuban Puerto Rican
Yeah, got you feelin the funk
Who's the mystery man, til you pop the trunk
No need to second guess me and Psycho Les
If you predict I'm goin right I just might go left
And def the lyrics kick so my joints they fit
What you bit was a hit, and you can't say jack shiiiit
Here's a towel wipe the sweat (uh-huh)
C'mon, time to jet

Chorus: repeat samples 4X

Everywhere that I go, the boy.." --] Biz Markie
".. tear shit up!"

[Kurious]
Divine dropper of the shit that booms, I consume
Mad (??) that's how it is then exhale fumes
Out the nose and mouth, even hoes down South
Know my status as the baddest Puerto Rican nigga out
My ego shrinks from gettin jerked on the business tip
At times, wanna scream yo what is this shit?
Shiiit, man what the fuck?
All I want is a brew, I ain't even got a buck
Well I makes the brew, on the East coast
But on the other side of town, they gettin paid
I'm gettin jerked quick slayed out the back
With no trap, to bang, SLAP
Fuck a Billboard, cause I still score with mines
Wines intertwine in my liver, deliver the rhymes
But to no avail
Got me walkin the plank, fuck time to set sail

Chorus 1/2

".. tear shit up!" (2X)
"Kurious Jorge, on the welfare line.."

Influence carries over to a 70-flow
Got a old school knack, so the wack could know
We takin pride in our shit, though we're lackin the dough
Fuck that we're on the rise - like my DJ's fro
YEAH!  Hittin up the kicks and beats
Yo the Nuts got tricks for the chicks and freaks
Know my motherfuckin style, word to Miz
Prince Power in the house put me up on the biz
Miz got the sess combined with the hash
Two pulls and pass knock you on yo' ass
Hobbes, chill til the cypher stops
Kickin rhymes point blank, the mix, the drops
Come together harmonize us so it don't sound lame

When. you wasn't in

Cause too many people pay atten-tion
Not extracting the proper com-pre-hen-sion

I stomp
The new school ruler
Is cooler than Bartles & James
I make you think
I make you blink
Cause you wouldn't dare stare
When you pretend
To contend
With the, men
I put out my music to make fools get petrified
Here's somethin' I bet ya tried
Anylizing me
Taking notes of every little movement and action
Well, you're wiser, G
Cause other rappas ain't doin' that
So that makes you fresher than the rest of the weak, ones

Specially when the face look wack
You don't believe me
The man with the yellow hat'll tell ya
First I'll smell ya
If the whiff is fishy
Reply is kinda iffy
If, ands, or buts
I'm sure to tear the guts
I'm trippin' on a Tab
So I'm clumsy like a clutz
Struts is smooth
Sorta like a pimp
Ya call me King Jorge
Cause I'm swift with the ink
Which is drippin', off
The point of a felt
Tip pen, I'm flippin' and I might leave a speed, not
I need not
The words of a sucka
I play the rice & beans & I'm out muthaffff...

Oh yeah!
Here I go again to win

So watch me kill that shit

Got to blow me, got to blow me
Dumb motherphukk
Ya don't know me from shit
So get familiar
Illa, I be the monkey, constipated
Gorilla, what's the real?  unga-bunga!
I've brung the rhymes
Sip wines on the Tundra
Thunder because the lines equipped
No time to slip, cause I'm grippin'
The concrete street
And black & red Scottie Pippens
Whth the funk in ya back trunk
Let the spot get loose
Kurious, Hieroglyphics
We hangin' like a noose...
