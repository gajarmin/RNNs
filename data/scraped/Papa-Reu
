(*talking*)
This that boy San Anton', better known to y'all
In S.A. as Cocked Strong, giving you something
To ride and get high to, I'm chilling in the studio
With H-Town's finest, a nigga they call Z-Ro
So go on and bump this shit, and to all you
Niggas who I done jacked, in the game
Fuck y'all I got my beams on your ass, right

[Z-Ro]
Everytime you see me, I'm a different nigga
But don't worry about my aim, I'm consistently accurate with the trigger
My nigga, don't count your chickens 'fore they hatch
If you owe me some feddy you better pay me, I'm ignant about my scratch
I don't trust nan nigga, cause nothing but hate they be sending me
Can't determine my friends, from my enemies
I done had partnas that didn't help me, when my life was on the line
Talking about hitting me right back, I'm trying to knock this bitch down
Putting pussy before your partna, is disrespecting the game
Wonder why you broke, and them titty bars be collecting your change
Trick, nigga with all these bitch niggas are made to bleed
Snitching giving me another reason, to blaze the weed
And I don't wanna do another killing, another bid
They've been trying to give me the crack, since I was a kid
But I remain calm, pill popping smoking and leaning
If I wasn't high, I'd leave these niggas choking and screaming

[Hook: Papa Reu - 2x]
Ooh child, things are gonna get easier
Ooh boy, things will get brighter

[Z-Ro]
I keep my middle finger, pointed out at all times
Lyrically abuse somebody in all rhymes, indodging in felonious to the small crime
Everybody, wanna do a song with Ro
Why none of these niggas don't wanna get down, on a couple of zones with Ro
Fuck rapping, I need some right now money it's getting crucial
I'll be jacking, for some right now money
Niggas ain't ready, for the episodes that I supply
PCP influenced, I'm relentless nigga you can die
Fuck all these niggas and these white folks, I'm all alone
No friends, cause in the fucking end a nigga dies all alone
About to meet my maker, I hope my life is right
But it's hard to focus, when killers try to murder me every night
I guess this life is really hard now, fiending for the day that this war stops
Pulling my pistol, everytime a car stops
Live by the sword die by the sword, nigga my time is borrowed
I paint this, for another tomorrow

[Hook - 2x]

[Z-Ro]
I'm crucified by the media because I'm loved by the public
Even though I'm rated number one keep your thumbs up and shove it
They said I'm trying to sound like Pac is my confession to that
Bitch I can't help it if I sound similar when I be stressing the fact
See I'm gone scream it cause I mean it anything less ain't excepted
The fact that I'm dark and I'm restless is no resort of living reckless
Rest in peace to my niggas that got caught up in the struggle
But I'm showing love to the niggas that don't want to see me bubble
But I take that back, fuck you, I made it to the top ten on my own
And every bitch in every city is singing my song
Imagine that I use to sleep on a corner
Even in year two triple O, fuck working I'm selling marijuana
Pulling the bull up over my eyes you just can never tell
But I know if I'm faking I try to rap now one of tapes gone sell
I perfected being real, by staying true to myself
Now suicide is something, I don't want to do to myself I'm real

(*talking*)
Year two tripple O, Z-Ro, the new motherfucking don
Feel that, my nigga Cocked Strong from Sinner Tone
Day one my nigga, knowI'msaying
We gone put it down

[Hook - 2x](*Marilyn singing*)

(*Papa Reu talking*)

[C-Note]
We flossing they glossing, big bossing for life
Nina Ross paid the cost, so I made her my wife
I got them digital screens, in the back of the ride
I got them 20 inch strings, sitting low outside
Taking flights seeing sights, up in Kansas City
All the way down South, in Jackson Mississippi
Made a stop in N.O., so I can holla at Juve
Blowing green got a scene, in Baller Blockin' the movie
Pull the set fly the jet, bout to land in Texas
Touched down in H-Town, home of candy and Lexus
I've been around the world, should of seen what I saw
Pieces hanging gangbanging, down in Arkansas
Everytime that they see me, I'm in some'ing that's pretty
My nigga Ike's keep it tight, in Oklahoma the city
You know I gotta keep it real, with them boys down South
That got them diamonds in they grill, and the gold in they mouth

[Hook: Papa Reu - 2x]
Cause we flossing, we flossing
Everything glossing, they glossing
20 inch shining, they shining
Piece and chain swinging, they swinging come again

[Sugar]
God damn, what is life about
What I gotta do pull a rifle out, to have a cumfy nice amount of money
Take it from a playa, who's seen some'ing kicked
Hustling use to be my deal, till I noticed it ain't pay the bills
I do my thang around you satin, cut up cocaine around you
Couldn't even keep no slang around you, no mo' letting em hang around you
(ask girlfriend), slam cats like a screen door
In a Hurricane, Botany Boys top ranking up
In the harder game, see this lady always makes the bucks
From this state, niggas got carpet burns on they nuts
By letting em hang, wreck fools from the gate
I run with the big dogs, and the heavyweights
I peeped you, put up your defense to hate this
I rush your ass, like Terrell Davis
And Mavis, couldn't staple my rap book together
See I'm the type, that'll shoot dice or do whatever

[Hook - 2x]

[Lil' Flip]
I got ice, cause I get that do'
Cardier watch, tic-tac-toe
S-Class, Jaguar sitting low
(what you listening to Flip), man I'm jamming Big Moe
I'm jumping out, in Iceberg wardrobe
I'm 18, and I'm a CEO
My lifestyle, is what you see on television
PT Cruisers, Navigators, Expeditions
I fuck hoes, everyday of the week
10 karats, my record label on my piece
Sucka Free knows, I'm the Freestyle King
I hate to say it, but my teeth look better than my ring

[Chris Ward]
I'm sitting low but large, backing out the garage
I'm in a brand new, fountain blue Bentley Anage
What the neighbors seeing, is not a mirage
I'm on my way, so sha'll I say Bon Voy-age
Cause I'm a wood wheel guider
20 inch glider, boulevard slider
Crawling low, like a spider
When I pull up on dubs, right beside ya
Hopping out in Iceberg, and Nike tennis
Flow is tremendous and endless, I'm a lyrical menace
I hang with big shots, like C-Note and the Chemist
Cause y'all know, Chris Ward floss just like the dentist

[Hook - 2x]

[Big Pokey]
I'm a H-Town playa, and I love to ball
20 inches on the crawl, V.P. and cigar
V-dubs and don't stall, me out there creeping
C-Note and Will-Lean, got the 6-4 leaping
Got bad broads peeping, cause they know we playa made
8's and Gator-aide, plus a bunch of bald fades
Escalades, DVD's
Wrists is lit up, watching three T.V.'s
Hoes on dick, like disease
H.P.D.'s on skis, A.C. blowing freeze
It's a hundred degrees, niggas dropping the top
If the car ain't convertible, then pop up the pop
Keith on Scott, trying to hop till the rim whop
If he don't stop, he gon be back at the rim shop
And them slims bop, nonstop
Papa Reu, tell em what we talking about

[Hook - 2x]

(*Marilyn singing*)(Lil' O talking)
Street life, see I've been trying to tell these kids
If you ain't live in these streets, stay the fuck away from these streets
You know I'm saying cause these streets is nothing to play with, you feel me
It's some real bullshit mentality out there you know what I'm saying
Everybody trying to get everybody, don't care how they get it
Don't care what they do to get it, as long as they get it, know what I'm saying
It's gone be the death of us

[Lil' O]
Hey, niggas in these streets ain't the same no more
They rob, steal and cheat it ain't a game no more
Your own friend'd hit you with the flames from the four
Get you for your stash, leave your brains on the floor
And really I don't want to slang caine no more
Cause snitching like it really ain't a thang no more
The minute they get caught man they sing like a ho
Bring the feds to your house have them bang on your door
That's why I be alone I don't hang no more
See me one deep in a ten range ro'
Thinking through the years everthing changed loc
Cause now a little piece done fucked her for some change or some clothes
Street life mentality by any means get it
Even if a couple heads got it again split it
They don't even be ashamed they be like, yeah I did it
But did you feel bad, I was with it

[Chorus: Papa Reu - 2x]
Cause if I got to beg, steal and borrow to make it to tomorrow
I got to do what I got to, cause who is gonna feed me

[Lil' O]
It's every man for himself, everyone for the scrilla
Hunger turns monkeys to geurillas
Fear turn a coward to a killer
Paper turns ladies into whores
Coward just to dream to the poor
That's why they rob jinks in the stores
And make them lay down on the floor
That's why them boys kicked down your door
Looking for the safe and the raw
They shot you like it ain't against the law
What happened to the rules of the lord
Thou shall not kill, thou shall not rob
Thou shall not steal, but now they be like thou shall not chill
When thou gets his hands on about a couple mill
Man, it's real in these streets
You got to be a soldier to deal with these streets
Act like a chump you be a meal in these streets
They be like, yeah I'm wrong, but I still go to eat, for real cause

[Chorus - 2x]

[Lil' O]
We need to pray to christ, the devil got our soul
And we all pay the price
How many boys you know got slayed over dice
Cause praying in the streets for a chain full of ice
It's the end of the world
And I ain't got a quarter to lend to a girl
But they ain't even tripping, they selling they tail
By these other hoes boost suppose to get them some mail
But room out of freaks nigga tell them theyself
Cause I know everybody trying to get them some wealth
But the route that they going gone get them to hell
Niggas always got the plan, but the plan always fails
And we always end up dead or in jail
Imagine years for the rest of your life you got to live in a cell
That'll make you stop living for real
It's now niggas doing time on the throw when they get in the chair
I tried to warn them but they say they don'y care, cause

[Chorus - 2x]

(Lil' O talking)
Let me tell you something, all that about your my partners
They love me and give me a dollar
If they love me let me tell you something kids
You niggas don't give a fuck about me, you know what I'm saying
You don't go the streets to find love
Cause all you gonna find in the streets is hate
Know what I'm saying, your g's is loving you, your parents loving you
You feel what I'm saying, your family loving you
That's the people that love you man
These niggas in the streets will slit your throat boy
Get on your note I'm telling you something real, you hear what I'm saying
It's some beg, steal or borrow mentality it's every man for himself
If they feel they can come up on you and get away with it
Don't think that they won't do it boy, you know what I'm saying
People care for real, game, that's game[O.G. Ron C - talking]
It's coming
I brought some of my homies in right now
[Call Me New Jersey] (Oh it's on now)
Uh let em' know

[Chamillionaire]
-Uh
Call me new jersey cuz I'm always in a new jersey
Type to go trade a foreign when the rims get to dirty
My drop is a damn dancer, topless like a lap dancer
Own the city and I care, so they call me "Care-Manter"
Is that ya last answer enn nigga dead wrong
I might snap like a fat women's leg in a red thong
Hold up, I'm off the hanger, spokes twistin' up off the swangers
Call me Cedric, cuz when I pop trunk I'm the entertainer
Bootleggers in awful danger, mean no disrespect
But is this my check, go hit the deck when I get my tech
Hold up, I'm off the wall, maybe come floss for y'all
*Last line was talked over*{Papa Reu}
I'm gonna make I'm gonna make you wet
From toe to neck from toe to neck

Try and come a test
Bullet holes go into yo vest
Straight through yo vest

Chorus:

[Big Moe]
Everytime you see that Moe-Yo, man I'm po'd up
On 24's, so you know I showed up
See me on keep me down, I done blowed up
But I'm still the same ol' G, gotta hold up
Moe-Yo top down, when I'm sipping mayn
And wiggly-wood, what I'm gripping mayn
And my partna Thug Dirt, stays up on the lean
Bar promethazyne, is in my genes
And my kin folk Po-Yo, sipping on a potent fo'
On the low-low, knocking down bad hoes
And you know I stay, playa made my nigga
Talking down, I'll pull a trigga my nigga
Thoed young G, from the 1-2 to 3
Hes born and raised, the big bar baby
AKA, that nigga Big Moe
Knocking down bad hoes, Mo-Yo I do it slow

[Hook: Papa Reu - 2X]
Roll candy on that car, (po'd up)
Got about three in my cup, (po'd up)
Coedine got me messed up, (po'd up)
Ballers see wrecking my truck, (po'd up)

[Thug Dirt]
I got a styrofoam cup, a big bag of ice
A pint of prometh', and a bitch with a dyke
She come on two wheels, I call her bar on a bike
They both fucking sucking, and we drank all we like
She say call up on the eight, I'ma call Moe tonight
Pokey on the three way, and tell Reu to catch a flight
We gon hook up at the club, man later on tonight
Rock a show bust a pint, then top it off with Sprite
We drink mud nigga, not brown but the red
Slowed down in Texas, you can call me Screw Head
You gotta feel these boys, out the Southside of Texas
We dripped up and draped out, in a bubble gum Lexus
We put drank in the cup, drank on the black
Put drank on the sweet, and the rest in the back
Take my name off the bottle man, you catch a case for that
We sipping on some sizzyrup, you gotta feel that

[Hook - 2X]

[Big Pokey]
Thug Dirt I'm po'd up, I'm po'd up
Plus I drank it and I sell it, a nigga running low I need to load up
I tear the road up, sipping on this slowed up
Drinking out the styrofoam, cause it keep it cold brah
Niggas call me stitches, cause I keep it sewed up
Got a jug fourteen, what it go fa'
Let it go brah, all night everyday
Purple kush blowing on, purple stuff po'ing homes
In the zone, talking sluggish on my phone
To a yellowbone, pulling up on a hell-a-chrome hold up
I don't drank hard, I try to drink smart
Speed behind the wheel, tripping better thank God
What good is drinking drank, if you can't nod
Bout the same as a bull, if it can't charge
Need to try to stay awake, keep your guards up
Need to try to stay awake, keep your guards up

[Hook - 2X](*talking*)
Dum-dum, da-da-da-da-dum, dum-dum
Dum-dum dum-dum, da-da-da-da-dum, dum-dum
On the latest roll with my boy Z-Ro here
Z-Ro you ready ha, Rock yeah you dropping that hot shit
You really dropping that hot shit ha, Z-Ro let me
Hear what you gonna sing for this one, come on

[Z-Ro]
Three liter big red, got diluted nines fed
Able to make a bitch, wanna suck my naked head
I get fly when I wanna, graduated from corners
I know it tingle, cause your pussy marinated my sauna
If you capping I ain't tripping, cause I really don't need you
Prolly say your pussy gon be beat up, and having a seizure
Overseas vacation, Prime Co. communication
And radio stations, got us in regular rotation
Cause the guns unloaded, lot of heads got exploded
Destined to be the throwdest, if I'm properly promoted
Sewed it up like a sweater, financial back or go-getter
Then through your vest chest, with the talons in my baretta
Stay one step ahead of, my competition they better
Fly down from overseas sign down, and get to chumping for cheddar
26 letters than Ro, if you ain't know now you know
From Ridgemont 4 to Acapulco, I'm gripping grain in my flame

[Hook]
Sunday morning pulling out my bitch, I'm looking good
Nothing but diamonds around neck and around my wrist, I'm looking good
Doubles breasted tailor made, I'm 'Sacci'd down to the flo'
And it don't matter, if you step on my wing tipped shoe
Cause I'ma just go buy me some mo', (what it is what it is)

[Papa Reu]
Rolly on me wrist, Sansun me wrist band
20 inch rims, on me suspension
Foreign replay, and not forge my stun-a
Dressed everyday, in the latest fashion look
Boys the enemy, best respect the man
Listen to me, know it's rule number one
No buster ain't right, we told the game plan
You do, you better and change the wrist band
The way me flow, my retaliation
So listen to me boy understand, understand
It's a bezeled out wrist, and that I wear everyday
On the right hand-a, the Presidential Rolly
And it's crossed off, like a ton of ice on the tray
And the price start-a, my choice to lose security
If you don't believe me, ask your old lady
I know she saw it, from 'Poko miles away

[Hook]

[Z-Ro]
Pull up to my bump, as I let it recline
13's easy five screens, it ain't no fucking with mine
They think I'm fucking with nine, but I multiplied it by fo'
It took some time, but I decided to throw my bitch on the 4's
The bubble-eyed Mazaratti, on a mission to meet Scotty
With bullets for your body, cause I'm living like Gotti
Pistol grip and a beam, plus a murdering team
Cash rule everything me, that there ain't nothing but green
Jumping in and out of line, moving slow as I wanna
Smoking reefer bending corners, on 20 inch Yokohama
Cause these niggas be hating me, when I be crawling down
So I'm like Paul Bugsy with a infrared, cause these niggas be falling down
Steady yelling out timber, from the first dance January down to the last dance
December better remember, put a big shell casing up in you
Make you weak like SWV, when I shine and grind like E.S.G
But I gotta get love like the Big Steve, throwed in the game like that P-A-T

[Hook]

(*talking*)

Street life, see I've been trying to tell these kids
If you ain't live in these streets, stay the fuck away from these streets
You know I'm saying cause these streets is nothing to play with, you feel me
It's some real bullshit mentality out there you know what I'm saying
Everybody trying to get everybody, don't care how they get it
Don't care what they do to get it, as long as they get it, know what I'm saying
It's gone be the death of us

[Lil' O]
Hey, niggas in these streets ain't the same no more
They rob, steal and cheat it ain't a game no more
Your own friend'd hit you with the flames from the four
Get you for your stash, leave your brains on the floor
And really I don't want to slang caine no more
Cause snitching like it really ain't a thang no more

Street life mentality by any means get it
Even if a couple heads got it again split it
They don't even be ashamed they be like, yeah I did it
But did you feel bad, I was with it

[Chorus: Papa Reu - 2x]
Cause if I got to beg, steal and borrow to make it to tomorrow
I got to do what I got to, cause who is gonna feed me

[Lil' O]
It's every man for himself, everyone for the scrilla
Hunger turns monkeys to geurillas
Fear turn a coward to a killer
Paper turns ladies into whores
Coward just to dream to the poor
That's why they rob jinks in the stores
And make them lay down on the floor
That's why them boys kicked down your door
Looking for the safe and the raw
They shot you like it ain't against the law
What happened to the rules of the lord
Thou shall not kill, thou shall not rob
Thou shall not steal, but now they be like thou shall not chill
When thou gets his hands on about a couple mill
Man, it's real in these streets
You got to be a soldier to deal with these streets
Act like a chump you be a meal in these streets
They be like, yeah I'm wrong, but I still go to eat, for real cause

[Chorus - 2x]

[Lil' O]
We need to pray to christ, the devil got our soul
And we all pay the price
How many boys you know got slayed over dice
Cause praying in the streets for a chain full of ice
It's the end of the world

But they ain't even tripping, they selling they tail
By these other hoes boost suppose to get them some mail
But room out of freaks nigga tell them theyself

Imagine years for the rest of your life you got to live in a cell
That'll make you stop living for real
It's now niggas doing time on the throw when they get in the chair

Cause all you gonna find in the streets is hate
Know what I'm saying, your g's is loving you, your parents loving you
You feel what I'm saying, your family loving you
That's the people that love you man
These niggas in the streets will slit your throat boy
Get on your note I'm telling you something real, you hear what I'm saying
It's some beg, steal or borrow mentality it's every man for himself
If they feel they can come up on you and get away with it
Don't think that they won't do it boy, you know what I'm saying
People care for real, game, that's game{Papa Reu}

Bullet holes go into yo vest

The our ar ar artillery from world one, two, maybe three

Hatin' me look boy
Pop, look before you pull the trigger
Tell me boy, which gun bigger

Your family gonna suffer

The closes friend to me one day a hater
Tried to come and run up on me

Chorus:

I got my nine Bluka Bluka! Bluka Bluka!

(*Papa Reu talking*)

[C-Note]
We flossing they glossing, big bossing for life
Nina Ross paid the cost, so I made her my wife
I got them digital screens, in the back of the ride
I got them 20 inch strings, sitting low outside
Taking flights seeing sights, up in Kansas City
All the way down South, in Jackson Mississippi
Made a stop in N.O., so I can holla at Juve
Blowing green got a scene, in Baller Blockin' the movie
Pull the set fly the jet, bout to land in Texas
Touched down in H-Town, home of candy and Lexus
I've been around the world, should of seen what I saw
Pieces hanging gangbanging, down in Arkansas
Everytime that they see me, I'm in some'ing that's pretty
My nigga Ike's keep it tight, in Oklahoma the city
You know I gotta keep it real, with them boys down South
That got them diamonds in they grill, and the gold in they mouth

[Hook: Papa Reu - 2x]
Cause we flossing, we flossing
Everything glossing, they glossing
20 inch shining, they shining
Piece and chain swinging, they swinging come again

[Sugar]
God damn, what is life about
What I gotta do pull a rifle out, to have a cumfy nice amount of money
Take it from a playa, who's seen some'ing kicked
Hustling use to be my deal, till I noticed it ain't pay the bills
I do my thang around you satin, cut up cocaine around you
Couldn't even keep no slang around you, no mo' letting em hang around you
(ask girlfriend), slam cats like a screen door
In a Hurricane, Botany Boys top ranking up
In the harder game, see this lady always makes the bucks
From this state, niggas got carpet burns on they nuts
By letting em hang, wreck fools from the gate
I run with the big dogs, and the heavyweights
I peeped you, put up your defense to hate this
I rush your ass, like Terrell Davis
And Mavis, couldn't staple my rap book together
See I'm the type, that'll shoot dice or do whatever

[Hook - 2x]

[Lil' Flip]
I got ice, cause I get that do'
Cardier watch, tic-tac-toe
S-Class, Jaguar sitting low
(what you listening to Flip), man I'm jamming Big Moe
I'm jumping out, in Iceberg wardrobe
I'm 18, and I'm a CEO
My lifestyle, is what you see on television
PT Cruisers, Navigators, Expeditions
I fuck hoes, everyday of the week
10 karats, my record label on my piece
Sucka Free knows, I'm the Freestyle King
I hate to say it, but my teeth look better than my ring

[Chris Ward]
I'm sitting low but large, backing out the garage
I'm in a brand new, fountain blue Bentley Anage
What the neighbors seeing, is not a mirage
I'm on my way, so sha'll I say Bon Voy-age
Cause I'm a wood wheel guider
20 inch glider, boulevard slider
Crawling low, like a spider
When I pull up on dubs, right beside ya
Hopping out in Iceberg, and Nike tennis
Flow is tremendous and endless, I'm a lyrical menace
I hang with big shots, like C-Note and the Chemist
Cause y'all know, Chris Ward floss just like the dentist

[Hook - 2x]

[Big Pokey]
I'm a H-Town playa, and I love to ball
20 inches on the crawl, V.P. and cigar
V-dubs and don't stall, me out there creeping
C-Note and Will-Lean, got the 6-4 leaping
Got bad broads peeping, cause they know we playa made
8's and Gator-aide, plus a bunch of bald fades
Escalades, DVD's
Wrists is lit up, watching three T.V.'s
Hoes on dick, like disease
H.P.D.'s on skis, A.C. blowing freeze
It's a hundred degrees, niggas dropping the top
If the car ain't convertible, then pop up the pop
Keith on Scott, trying to hop till the rim whop
If he don't stop, he gon be back at the rim shop
And them slims bop, nonstop
Papa Reu, tell em what we talking about

[Hook - 2x]

(*Marilyn singing*)(*talking*)
This that boy San Anton', better known to y'all
In S.A. as Cocked Strong, giving you something
To ride and get high to, I'm chilling in the studio
With H-Town's finest, a nigga they call Z-Ro
So go on and bump this shit, and to all you
Niggas who I done jacked, in the game
Fuck y'all I got my beams on your ass, right

[Z-Ro]
Everytime you see me, I'm a different nigga
But don't worry about my aim, I'm consistently accurate with the trigger
My nigga, don't count your chickens 'fore they hatch
If you owe me some feddy you better pay me, I'm ignant about my scratch
I don't trust nan nigga, cause nothing but hate they be sending me
Can't determine my friends, from my enemies
I done had partnas that didn't help me, when my life was on the line
Talking about hitting me right back, I'm trying to knock this bitch down
Putting pussy before your partna, is disrespecting the game
Wonder why you broke, and them titty bars be collecting your change
Trick, nigga with all these bitch niggas are made to bleed
Snitching giving me another reason, to blaze the weed
And I don't wanna do another killing, another bid
They've been trying to give me the crack, since I was a kid
But I remain calm, pill popping smoking and leaning
If I wasn't high, I'd leave these niggas choking and screaming

[Hook: Papa Reu - 2x]
Ooh child, things are gonna get easier
Ooh boy, things will get brighter

[Z-Ro]
I keep my middle finger, pointed out at all times
Lyrically abuse somebody in all rhymes, indodging in felonious to the small crime
Everybody, wanna do a song with Ro
Why none of these niggas don't wanna get down, on a couple of zones with Ro
Fuck rapping, I need some right now money it's getting crucial
I'll be jacking, for some right now money
Niggas ain't ready, for the episodes that I supply
PCP influenced, I'm relentless nigga you can die
Fuck all these niggas and these white folks, I'm all alone
No friends, cause in the fucking end a nigga dies all alone
About to meet my maker, I hope my life is right
But it's hard to focus, when killers try to murder me every night
I guess this life is really hard now, fiending for the day that this war stops
Pulling my pistol, everytime a car stops
Live by the sword die by the sword, nigga my time is borrowed
I paint this, for another tomorrow

[Hook - 2x]

[Z-Ro]
I'm crucified by the media because I'm loved by the public
Even though I'm rated number one keep your thumbs up and shove it
They said I'm trying to sound like Pac is my confession to that
Bitch I can't help it if I sound similar when I be stressing the fact
See I'm gone scream it cause I mean it anything less ain't excepted
The fact that I'm dark and I'm restless is no resort of living reckless
Rest in peace to my niggas that got caught up in the struggle
But I'm showing love to the niggas that don't want to see me bubble
But I take that back, fuck you, I made it to the top ten on my own
And every bitch in every city is singing my song
Imagine that I use to sleep on a corner
Even in year two triple O, fuck working I'm selling marijuana
Pulling the bull up over my eyes you just can never tell
But I know if I'm faking I try to rap now one of tapes gone sell
I perfected being real, by staying true to myself
Now suicide is something, I don't want to do to myself I'm real

(*talking*)
Year two tripple O, Z-Ro, the new motherfucking don
Feel that, my nigga Cocked Strong from Sinner Tone
Day one my nigga, knowI'msaying
We gone put it down

[Hook - 2x](*talking*)
Yeah, y'all niggas don't really
Want none of this yeah, hu-hu-hu-hu
That's the sound of the battle cry

[Daz]
Motherfucker break yourself, I come for the fame and the wealth
Beat your ass with a belt nigga, tell me how does it felt
Bruise a whip, I kept it except
Keep it underneath the seat of my ride nigga, you looking at death
Notice the sign on the gate, don't beware of the dog
Beware of the owner, on my mama you's a goner
You just a punk motherfucker, I'm vicious with it
Delicious with it, I'm fresh out of motherfucking prison with it
On swoll, my ambitions is different behold
My attitude is cold, I'll bust your nose
I steal your soul, with what the reaper done sold
Hotter than lava rocks, nigga hotter than cold
I chew the game up, like button strings
And I'm high as a kite, niggas dying tonight
When my move swang change, I prepare to get bang
Cashing niggas like change, I steal your chain
Ha-ha ra-dadada-dane, ra-dadada-dane
Listen to my AK, nigga go bang
Jump up and act bad, it's Z-Ro and Daz
For you niggas with a badge your shit it gets bad

[Hook: Papa Reu]
Y'all niggas, don't really wanna go to war
Y'all niggas, don't know what you in for
Y'all niggas, don't really wanna go to war
(3-57 and nines, are knocking down your door)
Y'all niggas, don't really wanna go to war
Y'all niggas, don't know what you in for
Y'all niggas, don't really wanna go to war
(It's Dat Nigga Daz and Z-Ro, knocking down your door)

[Z-Ro]
Motherfuckers don't wanna go to war
Somebody might follow you home, and kill you in your garage
Better be careful who you beefing with if it's me, your body gon be leaking
Bitch
Call the plumber, and see if he could fix
Ain't no closing up the holes, from a 4-4
My advice to the Z-Ro haters, keep it on the low
I ain't playing no games, living under frustration and strain I'm agg'd
The reason, why my darkened pants sag
Blue and gray when I'm in your face, and everytime a nigga pass by
Looking at my ice so hard, look like they got some glass eye
Wish a nigga would, run up and be laying it down
Locate his neighborhood, hop out and I'm spraying it down
I'm a killer for real whodi, I'm warning you
Cause I done connected, with cuz from California
My nigga Da-i-Daz and he gon ba-a-blast, at your body
Before it get bloody, give up the cash everybody
And since it's a stick up on top of a grudge, so game over
I'm sick with it and relentless, you know my name soldier
Who that talking shit, catch your homie cause he fin to fall
He don't wanna box with bullets, bigger than some tennis balls

[Hook]
Y'all niggas, don't really wanna go to war
Y'all niggas, don't know what you in for
Y'all niggas, don't really wanna go to war
(Nine Millimeter, 3-57 this is war for)
Y'all niggas, don't really wanna go to war
Y'all niggas, don't know what you in for
Y'all niggas, don't really wanna go to war
(It's Dat Nigga Daz and Z-Ro, knocking down your door)

[Thug Dirt]
Y'all don't wanna go to war, I got killas that's so hard
Sick with a pistol, even better with a sawed off
Get caught with plex, talking loud on the set
I'ma chop that ass down, while I'm screaming who's next
You in the middle of a battle zone, your cover is blown
We done found out where you live, now you can't go home
Hot lead to your dome, you better run nigga run
When I cock this shit back, automatics fin to come
I'm sitting lovely with a full clip, about to let em rip
Vest on like Vietnam, grenades on the hip
Two extra nines, in the back of the whip
A 25 in the glove, just in case I wanna bring my bitch
You didn't need war but now you got it, somehow you gotta stop it
Like a 16, you bitch nigga I'ma drop it
I got heat like a frying pan, your eggs can't knock it
Thug Dirt got bullets, like rockets blow

[Hook][O.G. Ron C - talking]
It's coming
I brought some of my homies in right now
[Call Me New Jersey] (Oh it's on now)
Uh let em' know

[Chamillionaire]
-Uh
Call me new jersey cuz I'm always in a new jersey
Type to go trade a foreign when the rims get to dirty
My drop is a damn dancer, topless like a lap dancer
Own the city and I care, so they call me "Care-Manter"
Is that ya last answer enn nigga dead wrong
I might snap like a fat women's leg in a red thong
Hold up, I'm off the hanger, spokes twistin' up off the swangers
Call me Cedric, cuz when I pop trunk I'm the entertainer
Bootleggers in awful danger, mean no disrespect
But is this my check, go hit the deck when I get my tech
Hold up, I'm off the wall, maybe come floss for y'all
*Last line was talked over*[Papa Reu]
C'mon, you know it's been a long road
A long road to sucess, right
And a lot of people thought I was gone never make it
Well this is for you
And I know you might be helping my cjildren right now
HEAR ME NOW!

Chorus:

Now everybody wanna be down down with me
But you know it's to late (you know it's to late)
Back in the day when yo could of help me
You just use to fake (you just use to fake)
Look, all the girls shout and scream when we stepping
Out of planes (stepping out of planes)
They also let me in with top cerlibirties and it just
Can't wait (it just can't wait)

[Papa Reu]
Well now I ring out the rope around the Hummer
Followed by the Benz and the Lex Bubble
When I started they say I had no fame
Now all the girly them calling me name
Now it's ten G's plus to come see me

Cause the whole click gonna ride with me
They ride with me, you see

Chorus

[Papa Reu]

And when I shop, I have big big money
And when I'm on the mic

Million dollar house cross the lake man
Fediral agents after me

That's for you to be twisted
And fall for the oke-doke
They gone say that
?? ..
So keep yo head up
And be bout what you believe
To be a star

Cause that's the only way, way to strive
Now chevk my bank acount

With my mentality I'll never drop

Chorus: repeat 2X(*talking*)
Oooooh, yeeeeah

[Big Moe]
Everytime you see that Moe-Yo, man I'm po'd up
On 24's, so you know I showed up
See me on keep me down, I done blowed up
But I'm still the same ol' G, gotta hold up
Moe-Yo top down, when I'm sipping mayn
And wiggly-wood, what I'm gripping mayn
And my partna Thug Dirt, stays up on the lean
Bar promethazyne, is in my genes
And my kin folk Po-Yo, sipping on a potent fo'
On the low-low, knocking down bad hoes
And you know I stay, playa made my nigga
Talking down, I'll pull a trigga my nigga
Thoed young G, from the 1-2 to 3
Hes born and raised, the big bar baby
AKA, that nigga Big Moe
Knocking down bad hoes, Mo-Yo I do it slow

[Hook: Papa Reu - 2X]
Roll candy on that car, (po'd up)
Got about three in my cup, (po'd up)
Coedine got me messed up, (po'd up)
Ballers see wrecking my truck, (po'd up)

[Thug Dirt]
I got a styrofoam cup, a big bag of ice
A pint of prometh', and a bitch with a dyke
She come on two wheels, I call her bar on a bike
They both fucking sucking, and we drank all we like
She say call up on the eight, I'ma call Moe tonight
Pokey on the three way, and tell Reu to catch a flight
We gon hook up at the club, man later on tonight
Rock a show bust a pint, then top it off with Sprite
We drink mud nigga, not brown but the red
Slowed down in Texas, you can call me Screw Head
You gotta feel these boys, out the Southside of Texas
We dripped up and draped out, in a bubble gum Lexus
We put drank in the cup, drank on the black
Put drank on the sweet, and the rest in the back
Take my name off the bottle man, you catch a case for that
We sipping on some sizzyrup, you gotta feel that

[Hook - 2X]

[Big Pokey]
Thug Dirt I'm po'd up, I'm po'd up
Plus I drank it and I sell it, a nigga running low I need to load up
I tear the road up, sipping on this slowed up
Drinking out the styrofoam, cause it keep it cold brah
Niggas call me stitches, cause I keep it sewed up
Got a jug fourteen, what it go fa'
Let it go brah, all night everyday
Purple kush blowing on, purple stuff po'ing homes
In the zone, talking sluggish on my phone
To a yellowbone, pulling up on a hell-a-chrome hold up
I don't drank hard, I try to drink smart
Speed behind the wheel, tripping better thank God
What good is drinking drank, if you can't nod
Bout the same as a bull, if it can't charge
Need to try to stay awake, keep your guards up
Need to try to stay awake, keep your guards up

[Hook - 2X](Papa Reu)
Yo
When I see my boy C-Note I'ma buy him somethin' brand new
When I find Lil' O
You know he gone keep somethin' new
And of course, you know the original
Papa Reu!!!!
I'ma keep somethin' new, new, new
Look

First Verse (Papa Reu + Lil' O):

(Papa Reu)
We gone buy somethin' new, for the millenium
This triple O jag cost two million
Buy somethin' new, for the century
Double O, one drop top Bentley
And I'm gonna clown when they see me
In a jag truck with four TV's
Yachts and jets, yes we're overseas
Best to get presidential role's

(Lil' O)
Watch me get an A plus for the way that I bust
Presidental role's with biggetes and ice plus
Like plush, all of my foes they bite dust
When I bust my beretta, fat rat, with the cheddar
Drop the top on the cadillac, cool, and yell "WHOA!"
Hoes askin' who the fuck is that?
It's Lil' O
You ain't know?  These other ones shine, I glow
Blood stream for State, cristal and hydro
Man the way that I go, be havin' niggas sayin' man he left with my ho
And made a woman swear like she was doin' Tae-Bo
And Lil' O, man he put it in they face I know
For real I know
Bitches young follow him
He bail up in the club like he's King Solomon
Young nigga thuggin' ain't no stoppin' him
Poppin' champagne, jewelry with the rocks in 'em
The O ain't trippin', come on

Chorus (Papa Reu):

We gone shine, shine, shine, shine, shine, shine, shine
Platinum role's to tell the time, time, time, time, time, time, time
And all the diamonds gonna blind, blind, blind, blind, blind, blind, blind
Rollin' twenties all the time, time, time, time, time, time, time

Second Verse (Papa Reu + TC + C-Note):

(Papa Reu)
The windows be tinted, and we be in it
Five hundred cruise control, lights all in it
On the coast of Puerto Rico, with some women
Where my shorties at?  Where they at?
So come here my baby
You look and now you wearin' them guccis
So take me to where them rude boys be preachin'
You know they say we rich and we bubblin', we bubblin'

(TC)
We got so much money, we can't even count
Check my credit cards, bout X amount
Bout to pull somethin', out the garage
Seventeen, playin' with bout ten cars
My nigga Rue, bout to survive bank
I'm steady clubbin', ain't even old to drink
Ballin', that's all I know
White bentley off the showroom floor

(C-Note)
We gone buy somethin' new
Two thousand dollars a shoe
Ice the benz candy blue, now I'm comin' through
My lex bubble like moets and them private jets
With ten K around my neck, Prince and cut biggetes
I'm in the game like EA Sports
No more standin' on the corner pushin' island resorts
C-Note to buy the cars, we some million dollar players
We go with Papa Reu, cuz we real rhyme sayers
Parle' ers, police give me tickets cuz we ballerific
Next time I'm poppin' big shots, cuz all my letters kick it
Now we bitch slappers cuz we fantabulous
Walk around sell out the show, cuz niggas tired of us

Chorus (2x)

(Papa Reu)
Buy somethin' new, somethin' brand new

Alright (alright), alright (alright)
Alright (alright), alright (alright)...

[Lil' O]
Hey I'm just shaking and moving, moving and shaking
Getting cash, niggas trying to peep the moves that I'm making
See these dudes thought I fell off, but these dudes is mistaken
But I've been balling for a while, so I'm use to the hating
Ain't no faking in my hustle, while some stanking they stumbling
They playing games, that's why they stomachs is rumbling, plus when you
Ride through on something, German shit and sitting on 20 something's
And drop the top and yell (whoa), you know you born head bumping
About who wants to get you, what's the word on the streets
But you get hit with pain killers, just for thinking I'm weak
You know that real gangsta shit, your body stink in the streets
The type of stuff that bigger man, on what you thinking is beef
I got the burdens of a Don, decision decisions
Should I give him head shots, or give his body incisions
Can't no one find your man, dog he's literally missing
To some old man found him fishing, cocksuckers I'm real

[Hook: Papa Reu & (Lil' O)]
Now it is real (already), you tried to chill (already)
You ain't really want no blood to get spilled (already)
So then you pray (already), and then you pray (already)
But hatas still begging you, for pistol play
And that day's today, a-ay-ay-ay-aaaay (yeah)
Grab your K and that K's today, a-ay-ay-ay-aaaay (whoa)
Grab your K, and that day's today

[Lil' O]
My whole attitude changed, when I touched six figgas
I'm like a lesbian now, I don't fuck with niggas
It's not cause I think I'm better, but my heart's been broken
I'm in my four corner room, up late at night one deep smoking
Trying to keep myself, from tripping and loc'ing
Cause boys got me so hot, they'll get hit in the open
And nigga O's not joking, O's not bumping
Fat Rat with the Cheese, give em something something
So you need to think twice, I'll remind you bro
That I've been catching pistol cases, since '94
So playa please don't judge me, don't mean mug me
Don't stare at me like that, nigga God don't like ugly
I'm just trying to get money, and live my life well
But these bitch niggas, wishing I fail
But for my kin folk on lock, locked up in a cell
Know I'm out here giving em hell, cocksuckers I'm real

[Hook]

[Papa Reu]
Try, you try to stay out the waaay
But guys will drag you into, pistol play
And that day's today, a-ay-ay-ay-aaaay (yeah)
Grab your K and that K's today, a-ay-ay-ay-aaaay (whoa)
Grab your K, and that day's today

[Lil' O]
Well they say money's power, so respect my rank
Cause if you sitting in a cell, I can get you shanked
You on the basketball court, I can get you bank
It's kinda like war games, you just got out flanked
By a five star general, on top of a tank
I send flowers to your funeral, possibly pain
Cause I'm a Southwest nigga, you know how we think
We kinda fly but when it's war, man I'm just gon hang

[Hook]

[Papa Reu]
Try, you try to stay out the waaay
But guys will drag you into, pistol play
And that day's today, a-ay-ay-ay-aaaay (yeah)
Grab your K and that K's today, a-ay-ay-ay-aaaay (whoa)
Grab your K, and that day's today
