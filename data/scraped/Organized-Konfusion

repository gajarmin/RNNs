[Hook]
Bring it on motherfucker, bring it on!
Bring it on motherfucker, bring it on!
Bring it on motherfucker, bring it on!
Bring it on motherfucker, bring it on!

[Verse 1: Pharoahe Monch]
I even be gettin more graphic than a Neo-Geo, thirty-two bit computer chip
Be slipped between my lips and then I'll spit!
Spit it out, spit it out, go ahead spit out, that itty bitty style you upchuck
Betta believe I buttfuck MC's from the rear it appears ya stuck up!
It's my termi-nology that strikes the MIND and rips this BEAT apart
You know the many styles I choose will bruise crews from the start
I flow awk-wardly that's awk-wardly I flow that's to the rhythm
Incisions are made into the brain and then I begin to give em
A lobotomy, follow me!
I'm shapin your br-ayi-yi-ya-in... li-li-li-li-like... pot-der-der-der-ery
(ALL OVER THE TRACK!)
Gimme the P-H, gimme the A-R
Gimme the O-A gimme the H-E, Pharoahe
Crazy poison tip arrows are hittin you from all directions
You cannot dodge or manage to dislodge them from the point at which they are connecting
I am se-se-selecting a ne-ne-ne-new style-style
For the p-pile-piles of MC's who try to get buck-buckwild
F-F-F-FUCK DAT!!! when I'm in a ren-ova-tive state of mind
I'm innovative, never been afraid of rockin the microphone
I'm prone to be eliminating
Cling when I sing a song of sixpence, if it makes sense/cents then sing along
Cling along to my nuts if you got guts then bring it on

[Hook 2X]

[Verse 2: Prince Poetry]
There is no equivalent one consider me the epitome of rhymes
Rhythm to techs execution is parallel to them with an exception of the organisms
My telepathy cannot be dismantled so stop sweatin me
Gettin me vexed, while outdated raps get trampled
FE-FI-FOE steps up elevations show
That I'm ahead of your time, specifically right behind a dope rhyme
Rippin shit up at prime time I'm, Optimus Prime/time material
Imperial wizard of vocabularic havoc I eat MC's like cereal!
That's soggy, milky skills like Mister Miyagi
When it's foggy I release globby spits of remains of rappers in the lobby as a hobby
I'LL, rip your nit-SHIT GET STICK QUICK, GET YOUR CREW - before I do
Something gory to your quite futile STYLES
Miniature raps get waxed, simonized
Into the fifth dimension of your centrifugal never typical stand attention
I'm, mystical rip shit til the power blows (BLOWS!)
Those chose to compete we delete em, observe defeat!
That's sendin down from above to GET CHA, HIT CHA, split cha ditch cha
Picture you, victorious
I'm gory plus your shit's mad boring
Bring it on

[Hook 2X][Hook]
Crush, kill, destroy, stress (Repeat x4)

[Verse 1: Prince Po]
Pain, stress
My brain, can't even rest
It's hard to maintain the pressure on my chest
Excess frustration strikes!
Blood rushes my head when I come across roads
With dead mics and wack promoted shows it's hard
But with the presence of God
I'm true to the game
So I'm back black, to take charge, and recap-ture
The time, wish it could never be wack -- I'm pure
I insert my lifeline into the track, the energy
In me is a poison with no un-revealed remedy
I'm spreading, like leprosy, throughout the record label
Cause mines put me and Monch's career in jeapordy
Can you come see me in the ghetto where it's dark
Bullets are real lost peeps lurks in the heart
Lord knows it hurts, we kick the Hertz to the curb
Execute first things first, and put blunted minds to work
My herd's tight and my fans supports
So I'm a-ight, for the time being seeing peace
But taking no shorts (no shorts)

[Hook]

(album version includes a short "taxi cab" skit here)

[Verse 2: Pharoahe Monch]
You will now consider me the apocalyptic one
After this rhyme, henceforth, there is none
NO more will exist, when I emerge
From the mist in whence I was born into, scorned
Most of you can't even comprehend what I am saying
To you even in my human form the message I'm relaying
Why do you choose to mimic these wack MC's?
Why do you choose to listen to R&B?
Why must you believe somethin' is phat
Just because it's played on the radio, 20 times per day?
My perception of poetical injection is ejaculation
The Immaculate Conception
The hall walker, who stalks bodies in Central Park
Soon emergency services'll outline that body in chalk
Then I begin to walk away and spit
Then when I walk away I talk shit!
Huh, a driver sprayed my face with mace
She didn't know that I enjoyed the taste of radioactive waste
When I'm in the backseat of your mid-town taxi
Don't even ask me for the cash G
The four cabs before didn't pick me up
Now ask yourself who the fuck's gonna stick me up

[Hook][Verse 1: Pharoahe Monch]
Let the trigger finger put the pressure to the mechanism
Which gives a response, for the automatic *bang*
Clip to release projectiles in single
File forcing me to ignite then travel
Through the barrel, headed for the light
At the end of a tunnel, with no specific target in sight
Slow the flow like H2O water
Visualize, the scene of a homicide, a slaughter
No remorse for the course I take when you pull it
The result's a stray bullet
Niggas who knew hit the ground runnin and stay down
Except for the kids who played on the playground
Cause for some little girl she'll never see
More than six years of life, trif-le-ing
When she fell from the seesaw
But umm wait, my course isn't over
Fled out of the other side of her head towards
A red, Range, Rover, then I ricochet
Fast past a brother's ass, oh damn, what that nigga say
"Aww fuck it", next target's Margaret's face *bang*
And I struck it
Now it's a flood of blood in circumfrence to her face
And an abundance of brains all over the street
Shame how we had to meet *bang*
Dashin, buckin, greet by fuckin family
They follow behind me in a orderly fashion
Bashin through flesh I'm wild
Crashin through the doors of projects hallways
To deflect off of the tile
I'm coming for you little girl
Once inside I shatter your world
Swirl, no more dreams no hopes when I spray
You better pray, to the Pope or the Vatican
Before I go rat-tat-a-tat again
I'm mad again brother somebody's mother will be sad again
But, whose blue skies will turn grey
From the attack, of the Mac-11, I'm a stray, bullet

[Nobody seen shit, nobody heard it -- 4X]

[Verse 2: Prince Poetry]
Great balls of fire, I'm travelling at higher speeds
To proceed to penetrate flesh, hitting the splint
After splitting the chest of a Queens fiend
Age of pagers shredded to pieces from the Glock 9
And it's hollow tips, it releases the polices
In back of the ambulance
Blood loss as I shift across your chest
Arrest, rupture, I mess up ya, slasher
Shall I bust ya liver, faster, blood pours *bang*
Now it's up to the master, boom, as I crash open the doors
Thank me for spraying the operating room
The body still consumes me, doc had to remove me
Mmm lord, why do they use me? *bang*
I'm takin individual for keeps Hobbes
So peep the cops, in the ghetto bustin shots for props
And when I hit, shit *bang bang bang bang*
Soon you forgets-me-not
Cops tried to explain to his pops what I done
I flip up the hollow tipper and I'm not the one
And as a human I'm the surprising one
Prince Po I flow the ripper, either way
You never, ever know how I'm coming
Metamorphasizing, rising in turbulence
Condensed into a bullet, pull it, now I'm making moves
With no sympathizing, uhh, so take a hit nigga, sprint *bang*
Onto the scenario, I'm at a party with O
A lot of honies parlay and the DJ's playin the Fudge Pudge flow
Five niggas come up in the club for a rub
[Yo O peep it, oh shit O duck (oh shit!, oh shit!)
*pop pop pop pop pop* *woman screams*]
Another hit, another struck
Here comes Mr. Stray Bullet
Five, the tip, getting my jollies from the screams of the ripped
In your chest, then I flip
Nip your liver, blood flowin like a river
Money starts to shiver then I give a delivery of burns
Bruises fake shoes is your renaissance
No response your moms is out cold
Figure I'm bigger takin your heart nigga at twenty years old
Stray Bullet[Verse 1: Pharoahe Monch]
As you look from henceforth I come
Riding the wind, thus eliminating
Competition from bird's-eye view, I'm
Descending in helicopters, in a village raid
Flesh will burn when exposed to the poetical germ grenade
I'm highly intoxicating
Your mind, when I'm operating
On cell walls to membranes, cytoplasms to protoplasms
Disintegrate em eliminate em now no one has em
In battle I display a nuclear ray that'll
Destroy bone marrow in cattle
Thereby destroying the entire food supply
That's crawling with AIDS, maggots, flies
It's ironic, when a demonic, government
Utilizes bionics and a six million dollar man
To capture me: clever, however
You could never ever begin to apprehend a hologram
Who's determined to fight solely
To defend in wars a land of the holy
I threw a rock and I ran
Cause I couldn't stand anymore within the depths of the sand
So don't ask me who's sane
Cause the hypnotical gases are eating my brain

[Sample]
Oxygen levels, check it, hydrogen levels, check it
Nitrogen levels...check it

[Verse 2: Prince Poetry]
Twenty-thousand leagues down below
Minus one-hundred and forty three degrees
Seize the info, gather the archaelogists
The aftermath needs to follow this cause it's
Deep, equivalent to the esophagus
Spreads to scientists, a.k.a. Optimus Prime
Time, television is, dead
On this issue and very much irrelevant to this intuition
Deleting any alias info and descriptive
Mortal calm, partition with infrared light - vision
Precision, beams
Colors, reds, fuschias, lime-greens
Black, don't you know my formulas form dope lyrics
Uplift spirits and yo I hear it's
Fatal, to walk the path of Konfusion, where it's
Torture some cherish, while most human-like beings perish
Subjected to death
Their bodies don't agree with the hypnotical intellect
Poetical acid is burning up flesh
At the end of corridor do you see me sitting there, Johnny More Grotesque
Literature somewhat equivalent
To concentrated sodium hypochlorite
Insight, foresight, more sight
The clock on the wall reads a quarter past midnight
You feel nauseous
Forever you will avoid my royal presence as I step into darkness

[Sample]
Now is the time...to stretch your brain to it's maximum

[Verse 3: Pharoahe Monch]
I am one who is one with all things
Thus the unorthodox I am
The paradox I am, the equinox
Extending my hand into dimensions
To unlock new doorways
And so the light has revealed to me that there must be more ways
And so I play with rhythms for something more than a mere game
Enabling me to advance in wisdom
Words will exist like vampires
No need for sunlight
From concentrations camps I escape with my sanity
In 2010 every man will be
Subject to global warming
Formless oval, millions of locusts swarming
Seek and you shall find the deliverer of a rhyme
The intelligent one, utilizing the mind
Third vision, surrounded by a three-sided figure
Containing the brain, the triggering mechanism
From which I strike
Sight beyond sight, sound beyond sound
Which comes from below the magma, the granite, the ground
The surface will seperate, dispersing harmful ashes
Your optics will not be able to detect
The deadly hypnotical gases
Damn it's hard to breathe
But if I got one breath left
I'll suck wind from the valley of death
Here I come, from the slums of earth to center
I reveal myself as a beast within a
Unbreakable shell, walking through
The doorways of Heaven - or is this Hell?

[Sample]
The time is now...right now
This is the hour, this is the new dawn!
This is the new day

[Verse 4: Prince Poetry]
As I step into the thunderdome
With flows as the wind blows
Visualize the intros
Releasing hypnotical gases, chemicals mixed, fixed
Taking it to the sixth round of poetical warfare
Energetically I walk with the flare
Rampaging like a rock-like figure
Throughout the night's atmosphere I swear
My wrist holds mind-trigger darkness can't overshadow me
Cause of high rate of smashing you, then trashing you
After I'm bashing you, with my hammer
Whenceforth passed to me, by Odin
Occasionally my profile is low-key, gamma
Rays brainwashed to transforms me
But I still withhold my hammer, to lift me up
For God still is my uplifter
I use this knowledge just to crush the cluster of Grifter
Night approaches so I proceed in flight
Back to the Hall of Justice as I continue to disintegrate em
Translating the codes in hypnotical language
Then a Theta assault stepping up
Frontin to be blunt, but I'm a radical creator of a
Poetical hypothetical mathematical slay slur
Punch that, stun that amazes and dazes
And phases the stages, with pages of the lost chapters
Unfound factors
So I stretch like Reed Richards across the land
Continue with reading your equilibrium
With concepts that confuse ya, metabolism's fallin off
Data consider oblivion
Now as I walk through the valley of death
Ignoring the battle lashes and gashes and rashes
The atom smashes, cause I released the last hypnotical gases[Prince Poetry]
Yo check it out, we gonna do it like this for the '93 flava
Know what I'm saying? Letting you know this is Organized
We got the crew in the house
And we definitely representin for the masses
So my man Pharoahe Monch gon' step to mic
Let you know what time it is
We gon-na do it like this, check it out

[Pharoahe Monch]
Help me out, to my peeps in Queens, clap your hands
To my peeps in Brooklyn, clab your hands
To my people in the Bronx, clap your hands
To my peeps uptown, clap your hands
It's three strikes, two tokes, one time for the mind
Three strikes, two tokes, one time for your mind
Three strikes, two tokes, and one time for the mind
Three strikes, two tokes, and one time...

Surprisssssse! Huh, open your eyes up, when I rise, huh
Pharoahe Monch I got skills for the wise!
Dumb, deaf, and blind you know it's time to organize
I'm flippin and rippin a style for the boys who wanna get wild
For the old and young, the Golden Child
I be the man with the gift of gab like Santa
Catchin - stacks of beats, from here to Atlanta
Ruah! What you say little weasel?
Can't block the foul if the style's cock diesel
I feel like busting loose
With the style that I produce to get juice from a troops
Black Kojack, better than Beretta
Any veteran knows the Medicine Man is better
Never sweat a girl that's inside of a Jetta
I just let her pass by with a wink to the eye
It's the M-O-N-C-H, I, G-A-I
The greatest rapper you ever heard please won't you relate my
Message to my critics, get it when you rewind
It's three strikes, two tokes, one time for the mind

It's three strikes, two tokes two times for the mind (Repeat 8x)

[Prince Poetry]
Check who gets wreck, it's me, Prince Po
Old school flowing, rolling thick with the O
R-G-A-N-I-Z-E-D, peace to the pioneers that made a way for me
To MC, and tear the roof off the mother, brother
So back on the underground because we love you smother
Wack MC's, like gravy on chicken
Hope some of the homeless say that our jams is kickin
Stickin flavor, in your grill piece
Pickin fat loops for troops to bop to, when time is ticking
Winding up, here comes the pitch
Prince Po throws strictly fast flows with no specific type of niche
But sometimes you gotta slow down the flow
Blow up the spot and let the whole world know
Here comes the Prince Po with another funky intro
Something to parlay with and ease the mental
Our instrumentals are too much for the average fan
So I bring the Jamaica funk (Uh!) That's what it is
I am too dope, too fat, Organized Konfusion is back
That's with a "K" black, get the fly exact stack
The money, start the party cause Organzied don't play that!

It's three strikes, two tokes two times for the mind (Repeat 8x)[Hook]
So why you trying to play me though?
Out like a sucker (Repeat 4x)

[Pharoahe Monch]
You're sneaking around like a sneaker baby, what's the beeper for?
Used to do my chores, now you're acting like a whore
Phones at my crib with you off to the store
For now, you don't love me no more?
Hey, by the way who's Kirk?
Left a message on my machine said you didn't come to work
You're AWOL from the job, plus who's Rob?
The way you're acting, I think you've been slobbing 'em
Sometimes I swear I think I feel like robbing 'em
But my papa told me never to snuff no girls
You give 'em diamonds, jewels, furs, pearls
Rings and shoes and cars and things
From time to time I wanna diss her
You couldn't blame me if I treat her like Amy Fisher
And dismiss her from the courtroom in a Yugo
You know, something like Joe Buttafuoco
But deep inside my heart, the pain still stings
When I think back and remember I was gonna swing her a ring
For her ring finger, yes I used to bang her
Like "inga binga bunga" but I'm out like Felix Unger so uh...

[Hook]

[Prince Poetry]
I reminisce back when I was swinging with Miss Pretty Young Thing
She got a kick outta my jeep and a meal at Burger King
I shot her ego down with my maturity
Getting papers from Port Authority doing security, uh
She just used to climb up in my whipper whip
Just to stress a nigga quick, young chick on a ego trip
Whip ping ha ha I had to stop the pigeon
Step, find a dove who comprehends exactly how I'm living
So I met a girl around the way from the Uptown set
We used to drown in sweat, uh
She was my darling til I lost my 9 to 5
She started dissing listen pretending then shitting on my pride
She tried to crush my pride so cut off so to the next
Uh, not for the sex, this one used to run through the projects
Gossiping with the next about the next
Loved to cover her neck, for stress gave her a cat as a pet
Itchbay didn't know which way she wanted to flow
Flowing with this nosey hoochie when I was out doing my shows
Doing a dem bow, dem bow, dem bow, dem bow
You can't front, you used to bust all over Prince Po
And fall fast asleep into the morn
Girlfriend started flipping, so yo Prince had to be gone
I'm just another brother trying to get around the fakes
And keep my mental state, no matter what it takes and yo...

[Hook][Hook x2: Lauryn Hill]
Oh-oh-oh I'm coolin' with my niggas on the Wake up Show-oh-oh
We kick a little something for the radio-oh-oh

[Verse 1: Nas]
Check it, bust it
Tune it up it's the corrupt novelist, Nas
Involved in this liveness radio waves
Slaves thrive inside of this
Wake Up Show flow, hip-hop's alarm clock, the bomb spot
Mellow with ganja, that makes my eyes turn yellow
Seat reclined on my leather sofa
However close to Na- be I'm Joe Quicks
King Tech I could just see 'em on the one and two son
My blunted crew pour the rum
92.3, number one in the slum
Representin' DJ's
Sway's the host, see police the most
What a collaboration see I'm comatose
No pork just knowledge and I'm born once more
It's the beat that blesses the street deep in the 9-4

[Verse 2: Pharoahe Monch]
Hip-hops last prophet henceforth in excistence
The 92.3 megahertz will exert radio waves
The slaves for a phenomenal distance
Electrons appear to slice through jeeps that you can hear some
Slum that it will chunk consider it will numb your eardrum
Kid, you sleepin' like a Latter Day Saint
With Sway & King Tech gon' wake you up on a saturday
9 to 12 verbal junkies overdose
And Joe Quicks will get you fixed to the mix
And then I'm ghost win

[Verse 3: Prince Poetry]
In your sleep I slap you with a lethal doses of medicine
So Wake Up with Organizin' the bretherin
King Tech, Joe Quiks better than your last fix
Severing wackness with Sway the host dumps a fat mix
Baby doll is frontin' so saturday night's open
Hoppin' on the one on one, times scope
And 92.3 degree is chokin' on chocolate
And from thou smokin' Prince Po'
Blows up from LA to Lobokin and I'm out

[Verse 4: Ras Kass]
Yo it's the Wake Up Show
My genetic make up take up
One hundred and thirty pounds of beef
But my lyrics shake up, like January 17th
Cause all the 16th MC's fossils
Protect ya neck and wear a bulletproof vest on ya tonsils
Amateurs bandage ya cornea
Cause you don't wanna see California
Get C-arson and spittin arsenic
With Sway Tech and Joe Quicks on the mix
Spinal meningitis ain't as stiff as the riff
Of Ras Kass, styles last like Jason crackers with whips
Come equipped you're losin' your paraphernalia
I'm a hip hop apostle
Sing in the gospel like Mehailja, Jackson
It's saturday nine until the break of dawn
Put cocaine on my tongue
You got crack now rock on *echo*

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Dred Scott]
Saturday night get live set it off
Right swing with my peeps
King Tech yo pass the mic and turn her up
Yeahyeahyeah it's peen kablow Dred Scott it's
Nine o clock, time for the Wake Up Show
To the breaker you think I'mma say dawn
But I say, day, cause it rhymes with Sway
My word is bond I'm on the scene
Plottin out the mainstream doin
Them right, with Joe Quicks on the mix
Late in the night so tune in
Cause the crew don't sleep
Boomin in ya Jeep on 92.3

[Verse 6: Shyheim]
It's 9 o'clock PM, 92.3 the Beat begins
To rock hip-hop non-stop, you know who got the props
In L.A. on saturdays, Tech and Sway no doubt

[Verse 7: ??]
Set your clocks for the unorthodox hip-hop that drops
Nine to midnight King Tech and Sway yo those kids is tight
In the mix with Joe Quicks the verbs spit verses
With the purpose of droppin curses like a triple six
Fat snares and dirty kicks to get ya open
From Watts to Oakland it's that raw {shit} that start provokin
Smokin, word's precise like a laser, cross roads in the Wake Up Show
We'll get your party shakin like a pager on silent mode, yeahha
Nine to twelve saturday night fool, peep the episode

[Verse 8: Saafir]
Wake Up, Show, and you can tell
I'm not spittin it in no muffled style
No silent screams just weddings, rings
To swings and Sway Techs King, Tech-
-nique and I'm building in a little agility from Joe Quicks
Hey Jay-Z in the eyes
It's seen only on the bottom of water risin
We're takin groups
Put it on 92.3 while your beatin boops, oops
I mean coops bumpin in to mission on the twine
Swoop saturday between nine and twelve I'm delvin
We're well tuned in to the pattern of the year
Here on 92.3 times me
Bo junks young ricks are bolders
That are only soldiers are connected to Wake Up Show
Ya right

Three o' clock in the morning
Dirty time to be in
Port Authority Terminal
Alone in New York City

[Verse 1: Pharoahe Monch]
You are in need of deliverance from discriminative images
And unusual amount of musical carcinogens
Here’s an adrenaline boost with timberland boot sentiments
I vegetate in vaginal canals (No venison)
That is V for victory, averbally indicative of why I haven’t been inundated
Shit, I demonstrated before that, I see the beat as a clitoris
And my tongue as the stimulation that’s vibrating from slow to vigorous
It moves with the finesse and the smoov-ness
Even inside the grooves of a record
Check it, check it again
And check the metaphors, make sure they’re makin’ sense and then
TwitPic it like courtside Knicks tickets
Gifted with algorithms, terrific with quantum physics
Merciless with the words, your verses are quite horrific
And poor morally, I never support ‘em
Caught ‘em in the Port Authority off guard and fought 'em orally
Renegade 13, who want W.A.R.?
At three o’ clock in the mornin’
My spawn escaping the grips of Satan, my supremacy is Bourne
My identity is Jason
Which you are now currently hearing, I recite it in verbatim
No ultimatum, played ‘em, laid ‘em out on the curb
Made ‘em wait before I slayed 'em when I served ‘em with the verbs at

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Prince Po]
Clever and pretty young girl, caught up in the zone
Trapped in the jaws of poverty, drug abuse in the home
Three BFFs already pregnant, her every move is alone
Seventeen and battered with thoughts of getting to put two in the dome
Stressed and ready to just end it, suspended in disgrace
Hate to descend her, her faith heavily contended
Bend it over backwards, rend it, lower it to, even to extend it, fam
Like a ninja on a binge for vengeance, man
Grabbed the stash and cash and ran away
Thought she had to mash, professin’ out of the gate
Two and a half days later she’ll be in the land of hate
The big city is full of dreams, but you gon’ learn today
Jumped on the bus, cap low, yo she blended quickly
Ended by a vacation, a parking lot attendant
Waving a Mets pendant, soul crying, lying like a remnant
So tiring, so inspiring it feels to be implemented
No guidance, but her science refused to stay down
But wait!
Everybody knows you don’t go Greyhound, it’s time to shake
The service is the verse, but first, with time to break
Bust violently, it’s pulling in the gate
Strolling through the terminal, dude saw the pomade
Got up in the air, painted a picture looking great
Not she’s out there on the stroll, lost, pussy on a plate
With demented sickness, substituting cookies for the cake

[Hook][Red Hot Lover Tone]
For all my motherfucking niggas, word to Herb we get stupider
Running mad circles round your crew like Jupiter
Oops, I mean Saturn, rappers sadden
Cause I'm mad in the pad and suckers wish they had and
I'm bagging the bitches grabbing, my pockets fatten
Like Madden, then I just lamp like Aladdin
So what you gonna do when I come through your town
With mad niggas who love being locked down
Facing convictions, throwing conniptions
I got more bitches than them royal Egyptians
Step to this mic you're a goner
Cause Red Hot Lover's right on like Cynthia Horner
I better warn ya, you'll get your ass kicked, I'm blasted
That's it, I drop it like a clumsy black bastard
I'm getting figures from my rap diggers
Got my shit-kickers, yo, this is for my niggas

[The Notorious B.I.G.]
Introducing the black bastard from Bedrock
Guaranteed to make your head rock, tote Glocks
Drop cops that mistake me for Rodney
Strictly head shots, I knock the twist out your dreadlocks
Who got the props? Biggie
Who got the Glock? Biggie
But who is he?
You can't get my description, you need a prescription
Two doses of the ferocious
Feel the weight when I'm crushing 'em, bumrushing 'em
Stuffing 'em, I put the pressure on em, hon
Lord a mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just sliced like a Ginsu
Look what I been through, the Brooklyn streets
The obese thug nigga from the East
The black nine, hard to find motherfucker
After the rhyme press rewind, motherfucker
Strictly for my niggas

[Prince Po]
I nod my head cause the flavor hovers over
Universal Soldier of Hip Hop, somebody shoulda told ya
40 Projects Southside Jamaica Queens, please don't
Sleep I walk the unforbidden where most MC's won't
Check it, if you ever felt sceptic about my intellect, it's
Hectic, I'm like antiseptic on record
Disinfectant show wrecker, sound seizing your sector
Local areas, across seas, even in Rome and Mecca
I'm known, Prince, organizing with the Red Hot Lover
And the bad brother Biggie Smalls from another
Planet called Brooklyn, hey good looking
Do you like your hot chocolate after dark - uh
I'm scared to get you hooked in
You might have to seek medical attention, the unforgettable type
Representing my niggas rocking, rocking the mic right
Harcore M.O.P. type shit
Peace to my other half and my niggas doing bids

[Li'l Fame]
I used to start more shit than high school bullies
I was doing my thing since my nigga Boom Bang used to steal cars from police
I break niggas up like referees
Put em on point, back out my joint and making 'em move like refugees
Li'l Fame rep is Brooklyn bound
Still niggas that fuck around'll catch a beatdown from Brownsville
I'm going all out the western way
Old school or new school, I beat your ass like it's freshmen's day

[Billy Danze]
For y'all wannabe emcees F-A-G's
You gon' fuck around and make that nigga Bill squeeze
I'm representing for all mines with nines
Hardcore's in town, my niggas that get down
A hill figure on the trigger (true)
Your Crooklyn sounds got pounds and break through
Stopped puffing the lye, still sipping the brew
So I be on cruise when you snooze and then you lose

[Li'l Fame (unreleased mix only)]
It's Li'l Fame, motherfucker (slap, Little Mallet)
We bring you pain, motherfucker (slap, Little Mallet)
Cos I'm rugged no gimmick
And I'm taking rappers out like Uptown niggas be doing bitches on 125th and Lennox
I represent M.O.P., niggas that act stuck up they get stuck up
Or even fucked the fuck up
Peace to Tone, yo pass that blunt, hit this slicker
This is for my niggas

[Billy Danze (unreleased mix only)]
Yo hold me down, Fame (I got the pound)
Danze with the truck shit, that I don't give a fuck shit
I'm hitting niggas where it hurt, I do work
(I'm packing my blue steel) so you niggas hit the dirt
The M.O.P. we been busting out for days
Taking 'em through a phase, going out in a blaze
I'm out jail still holding my steel
(Bucka) Bow! Wargames representing this build
Brownsville, for my niggas

[Red Hot Lover Tone]
Word, and Red Hot Lover Tone tossing suckers like salad
Incredible vocabulary coming from the Brooklyn freak
Peace to Fulton Street
Knuckleheads'll get wrecked with the quick mic-check
My intellect shows no respect for suckers who slept
In fact my rap style attracts
I have your girl looking for me in broad daylight
With a flashlight, pillow, and mattress on her back
Cause yo shit is wack
So here goes the No-Doze, I'm putting it on foes who oppose
Coming off like porno pantihose
Peace to Organized Konfusion and B.I.G
The M.O.P., from R-e-d
For all my niggas in the NYC[Narrator]
Where most niggas would stop, he would JUST be gettin started
Go all out
I seen people stop in mid-stride, reverse, change directions
Go through buildings to avoid passing him

[Organized Konfusion - mostly Prince Poetry]
Nine times out of ten, a nigga wanna shine
But nobody shines brighter than the light Organized
Extra-tight, one hundred percent, drama full armor
The persona is to "Crush Kill Destroy" the bad karma that
Hums superb, lyrics emerge from the slums
Of the latest gun drug runs, fun feds and dum-dums
Priority and confidential
Organized mission is rippin any instrumental, believe that

[Pharoahe Monch]
Wa-wa-wa-wa-watch me-me-me get-get me-me so-so-in-in-incred-
-di-di-di-dibly-bly-bly ov-bly-bly over your head, head
I shed styles like reptile skins
While nigga rhyme the SAME, rip beginnin to the ends
Of they LP's, try to tell me shit
With they pussy-ass poems and they bullshit (bullshit) skits
Shit I'm hitting you harder than Nancy Kerrigan on the shin
FUCK IT if niggas can't comprehend

[Prince Poetry]
Fuck yo, consider me iller than ill, with skill, nigga chill
Still, some sleep, too deep, not to get bitten
When I reveal technique - wherever I speak
I'm goin in for the kill, for real
Future street prodigy follow the model is hollow
Speak your name if your lyrics hold sorrow - ain't that a damn shame?
Konfusion with the K and whole effects like rain
With acid from tomorrow, Prince Poe Bizarro
Maintains the status, apparatus throughout the stratus-phere
Here stands one of the biddest
City crispy rhyme rebels clear like crystal
O.K. be the initials, ghetto dope officials

[Organized Konfusion - mostly Prince Poetry]
Nine times out of ten, a nigga wanna shine
But nobody shines brighter than the light Organized
Extra-tight, one hundred percent, drama full armor
The persona is to "Crush Kill Destroy" the bad karma that
Hums superb, lyrics emerge from the slums
Of the latest gun drug runs, fun feds and dum-dums
Priority and confidential
Organized mission is rippin any instrumental, believe that[Pharoahe Monch]
By the grace of God, I give a speech like Malcolm
Expressin, flexin, flaunt the style that's wicked (UHH!)
Inflicted, addicted -- now people can't understand
The particular way that I've kicked it
Smooth (mmm) is it not? (Yup!)
Is it dope? (Yup!) Is it hype? (Mmm-hmm) Is it hot?
Easy for you to hum along to whenever I'm rappin
Keepin your feet, tappin, and keepin your hands
Comin together you may think you're nice but I am Alpha Beta
Glee and clap on the microphone, to kick a rhyme like, this one..

[Prince Poetry]
Artistical formulas, label me as a hip lyric professor
Pressin to be the one a lyrical chauvanist
Study facts my brother, read all about it
Cause Prince Poetry and Monch gets on down undoubted!

Somethin smooth yes, prepare for the audience pleasers
United together, through thick and thin forever
Just for the people's pleasure
This is something new for you
We are.. the simply too positive MC's

[Pharoahe Monch]
Design a rhyme like an inventor
Intertwine, combine the centrifugal forces in the center
Giving it a steady a flow, who's like dope (you are!)
Better yet, I'm like acid
Cooler than Lake Placid
You're loving it when I'm passing it off, slick (slick)
So that you know (so that you know)

[Prince Poetry]
Well it's me, your majesty, Prince Po, I flow
Like spring water out of a faucet when I complete it
The text like toss it cause I will toss it to the Pharoahe
Capital M, lowercase O, then the N, then the C-H
Witness the presence of the two N-E-W
Intellectual through rhythm I went interjectin you
A few messages, paragraphs, stories, a few laughs
When it comes to steppin yo there ain't no quarters
Or even a half like poison, I subject to feed you venom
I find em, line em up, I fold em up, and Monch will KILL EM!

[Pharoahe Monch]
Curteous! Givin a high-five or handshake
But I can flip, like a chef at the House of Pancakes
When I speak, I create a new strange tongue
MC's clingin I bring on a new swing and they swung
Off the tip I'm well equipped to stick to the cut when rhymin
The kind of emcee you'll find, with the mind of a minister
Chronological timing or maybe Simon Bar Sinister

[Prince Poetry]
Hmmm, mm mm mmm! Yo
Sometimes I'd rather stop acceleratin and flow
To a slowwwwwwwer tempo sit back relax bust the
Introduction that you're sleepin on, I must awaken you
Now come with us cruise in, cause me and Monch
Is takin you to another dimension, keepin you up to par
Look up to me as an advisor
Much wiser than the average rap star/struck you
Not as another but a brother who's hype
Sim-pl-ly too positive MC's too dope too trife
To comprehend, this is finally the end
To my foes and my skeezers, the audience pleasers

Somethin smooth yes, prepare for the audience pleasers
United together, through thick and thin forever
Just for the people's pleasure
This is something new for you
We are.. the simply too positive MC's[Hook - Organized Konfusion]
Lord, help me out now
We gotta get together
We gotta organize
No matter the weather
It's a Black Sunday, hey

[Verse 1 - Pharoahe Monch]
I used to watch my grandmother catch the Holy Ghost in church
For her soul she would search
Five years later now I'm off to work
In a department store, I'm foldin pants and shirts
At the end of the week, lord
Just enough loot to put some cheap sneakers on my feet
That's when I made a promise to my momma I said
"I betcha you see me at the Apollo one day and I'ma..
Be kickin that fat funk shit;
Black, mackadocious -- speakers in the back trunk shit"
Cause the boss is bossing me, that's costing me
To miss classes and I feel he's forcing me
To be a jackass in the future; then, who's gonna shoot ya?
At this point in my life is where I chose to write rhymes
Instead of doing crimes
Nineteen eighty-six to nineteen eighty-nine
Organized Konfusion, did not, get, signed
But we will soon one day, until then
I return at twelve noon on the track, Black Sunday

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Prince Po]
Yeah, remember losing a loved one, lawwwd help us to make it over
Delete the pork, the cigarettes and forty-nine cent soda
We came a long way and I'm still runnin for my freedom
Still have one hundred miles to go, escape from the
Crack vials, so, you can feed that baby
I used to ride the elevator with the crazy lady
I year later I made demo cassettes with the Monch
My stick was on the fader, rhymes ran out quick so I
Encouraged Monch to start writing rhymes
And Mrs. J cooked dinner then we came into same hard times
Sour contract shouldn't have been on the plate
Two apes escaped, back to L.A. with our demo tape
The state of mind I was in since Paul C died is that
I gotta get mines, representin 40 projects so I'm
All-in, gotta make papes and all that
Close my own record deal cause I can't fall for that
Old snake shit, hissin in the grass
For the cash, little cents, intuition listen
If you're missin' my money, my fist you will be kissin'
Dang, I don't even understand

[Hook]

[Outro]
Check it out
Like to say what's up to my whole herd
Like to say rest in peace to my man J Dilla
And rest in peace to my man Juice
Three strikes[Hook]
Bring it on motherfucker, bring it on!
Bring it on motherfucker, bring it on!
Bring it on motherfucker, bring it on!
Bring it on motherfucker, bring it on!

[Verse 1: Pharoahe Monch]
I even be gettin more graphic than a Neo-Geo, thirty-two bit computer chip
Be slipped between my lips and then I'll spit!
Spit it out, spit it out, go ahead spit out, that itty bitty style you upchuck
Betta believe I buttfuck MC's from the rear it appears ya stuck up!
It's my termi-nology that strikes the MIND and rips this BEAT apart
You know the many styles I choose will bruise crews from the start
I flow awk-wardly that's awk-wardly I flow that's to the rhythm
Incisions are made into the brain and then I begin to give em
A lobotomy, follow me!
I'm shapin your br-ayi-yi-ya-in... li-li-li-li-like... pot-der-der-der-ery
(ALL OVER THE TRACK!)
Gimme the P-H, gimme the A-R
Gimme the O-A gimme the H-E, Pharoahe
Crazy poison tip arrows are hittin you from all directions
You cannot dodge or manage to dislodge them from the point at which they are connecting
I am se-se-selecting a ne-ne-ne-new style-style
For the p-pile-piles of MC's who try to get buck-buckwild
F-F-F-FUCK DAT!!! when I'm in a ren-ova-tive state of mind
I'm innovative, never been afraid of rockin the microphone
I'm prone to be eliminating
Cling when I sing a song of sixpence, if it makes sense/cents then sing along
Cling along to my nuts if you got guts then bring it on

[Hook 2X]

[Verse 2: Prince Poetry]
There is no equivalent one consider me the epitome of rhymes
Rhythm to techs execution is parallel to them with an exception of the organisms
My telepathy cannot be dismantled so stop sweatin me
Gettin me vexed, while outdated raps get trampled
FE-FI-FOE steps up elevations show
That I'm ahead of your time, specifically right behind a dope rhyme
Rippin shit up at prime time I'm, Optimus Prime/time material
Imperial wizard of vocabularic havoc I eat MC's like cereal!
That's soggy, milky skills like Mister Miyagi
When it's foggy I release globby spits of remains of rappers in the lobby as a hobby
I'LL, rip your nit-SHIT GET STICK QUICK, GET YOUR CREW - before I do
Something gory to your quite futile STYLES
Miniature raps get waxed, simonized
Into the fifth dimension of your centrifugal never typical stand attention
I'm, mystical rip shit til the power blows (BLOWS!)
Those chose to compete we delete em, observe defeat!
That's sendin down from above to GET CHA, HIT CHA, split cha ditch cha
Picture you, victorious
I'm gory plus your shit's mad boring
Bring it on

[Hook 2X][Hook 3X: Prince Poetry]
(Bring it on!!) You can set my mode to WHATEVER
Or simply pay the PENALTYYY for walking this endeavor
My observations on your orchid egos'll let you penetrate
(We'll DEVASTATE) have you fuckin fall when you fake!
BRING IT ON!!

[Pharoahe Monch]
Even be gettin more graphic
Neo-Geo, thirty-two bit computer chip
Be slipped between my lips and then I'll spit!
Spit it out (OUT) spit it out (OUT) go ahead spit out (OUT)
That itty bitty style you upchuck
Betta believe I buttfuck MC's from the rear it appears ya stuck up!
It's my termi-NOlogy that strikes the MIND and rips this BEAT apart

WE'LL DEVASTATE, HAVE YOU FUCKIN FALL WHEN YOU'RE FAKE!!
BRING IT ON!!![21 seconds of conversation to open the song]

[Prince Poetry]
Yo grip, you got your eyes fixed on me like as if a bitch
Caught me in a glitch reachin at cases no beef just fish
Straight pitch, what the fuck is the problem? You and your man

[Pharoahe Monch]
Yo move back, y'all rap niggas take this shit too far
I'm like an ox, brother my box-cutter leavin a scar
All my peoples are connected
That shit y'all spit on records is infected and dead
You'll get injected with lead
Ain't no need for me to sweat no man, my crew makes stacks
You just be black and ass nigga plus your records is whack
You'll get fucked up (I'll get fucked up? Nah I don't think so money..)

[Prince Poetry] + (Pharoahe)
Violatin my 360, his niggas started revolvin
That problem needed quick solvin so we started to brawlin
(Combinations of haymakers deleted all of the stallin)
Callin for nobody, determined just to keep these niggas fallin
(To the big man's ribs) after a left to his jibs
Him and his man transform into these six rowdy-ass kids

[Pharoahe Monch]
I never went since Prince struck first, bitches dispersed towards the corner
Too many enemies for me to overpower
I wanna at, least take one nigga down with me
If I have to go out, I'm goin scrappin no doubt
First nigga up to bat gets bent (bent) pinned (pinned)
Immediately, up against the wall (ha) him (him)
Wig pushed back, thumb to windpipe
Reacts numb his whole face contorts when eyeballs contract

[Hook: Prince Poetry] + (Pharoahe Monch)
When shit comes down to it, no hesitation
Actions speaks louder than words in all situations
Do what we gotta do, set it off, let it loose
Fuck it, we ready for confrontation
(When shit comes down to it, no hesitation)
(Actions speaks louder than words in all situations)
(Do what we gotta do, set it off, let it loose)
(Fuck it, self-preservation)

[Prince Poetry]
I can't believe these whack rap niggas is swingin on me
The dark-skinnned kid caught me in the eye now I'mma bring it to G
I square him up while Chuck tries to trip him, fuck he's too fast
Over the top, duck, champagne and the glass struck
Now Moet's all over the floor and I'm slidin through it
Pharoahe I got your back, splittin him, exposin bodily fluid
From fraudulent foes, with points to prove, and no holds barred
Raw dog like out in the yard

[Pharoahe Monch] + (Prince Poetry)
I'm peepin out how their security maneuvered and selected
In multiples of 3 random niggas end the beef to be ejected
Collected my thoughts, connected with members of medicine men
Who explained to me that DT's got the block locked seized
They wouldn't let us in
Sighed, slide to the midstream, plus swallow your pride
(This is the second time swine, one-time, had to spoil it)
Pull the lids on the commode and drop the Glocks inside the toilet
If we, move swiftly, we just might make it
If the opportunity arise to bounce, let's take it

"Police be clocking me" -] KRS-One - Hip Hop vs Rap

[Verse 1]
I make wax, I pay tax, I don't show cracks
Something to kick back, you callin' on dispatch
The deal you'd did with a dealer you the distel
Took Gladys from his box now he's burried in the system
You see me comin' out of my building
All types of days and nights, wondering if I got a nine to five
Those I always do, so you cry I spy
A flashin' goes smile, you in the corner of my eye
Walkin' I feel the hawk over right the side
It's over from the act, lyricist start to walk live
Shop lift or what, then I start to jog
Hearin' speed accelerated from the J-8's car
The sirens sound violent they expect more not ready
I'm on the stoop my man named Little Eddy we started laughing
He's nextdoor from me, is a house that has traffic like drugs are free
But I'm a new face in a new place of a melon race
Gets black in 'em makes a good fellon case
And that's not so and I get mad cause everywhere I go
Long as I'm dark walkin clarks in my village tho

"Police be clocking me" -] KRS-One - Hip Hop vs Rap (8X)

[Verse 2]
They clocking, shocking and knocking me
Wantin' a reason for whocking me
But I ain't committin' no crime
Soon as they stoppin me O.C. roll if a dolo went solo
Cop car come screechin in my presence in a second yellin "Freeze!"
I'm scared how can I stop hopped over a fence
Runnin' frantic sendin' O.C. into a panic
I 'fused to be rock me hardly you won't scar me beatin' me down
Yellin' smellin old and coffee sender
Fuckin' hard, but soft to a stick
Some cops are cool and some are just downright dicks
You won't in asphyxiate me in a choke hole, death mockin' me
So for that even my dousin keep clockin me
Check my speedometer check how I'm fashion
Nice sticks if you don't had the same type of fashion
Two blocks behind me two jakes who want blue and white
Pair Glocks equals 32 shots I think not

"Police be clocking me" -] KRS-One - Hip Hop vs Rap (8X)

[Verse 3]
What for!? Is it my B-Boy presence mixed with mature
Is it the way Stone and me comb the city in a Benz
Legitimate plus without ends
Paperwork was right, we sat aside a red light
Givin' dirty looks, I guess assumin' we were crooks
Scopin' the car, tags of the par, rims shinin' in ya face
With the tires all along and I dig it
All young is my complection been through gettin' stress
So I know you understand what I manifest
A friend of me, uncool, that squares a black cop Jones
All crooked with fat rides and homes
Watch your own BB with the APP on your side
And corrupt cats corriscatin on the margin
Next time read me my rights check out the snipes
Look behind ya on the wall sucker I rocks mics

"Police be clocking me" -] KRS-One - Hip Hop vs Rap (8X)"Ahhhhhhhhhh yeah, c'mon now!" (3X)
(repeats in background 2X to fade)

Yo, stop look and heed participate in the re-organizing
Of a lyricist, decide the category I fall into
When I'm on the venue, I tend to
Serve a delicacy fella peep what's on the menu
The slept on phenomenon, the mic be in my palm and on
Many wanna hold me back, cause I'm comin' on strong
Subject matters are struck, my imagination
Is wonder, that's underestimated by
Sons of bitches who have power to sign me but
Flaunt it wanted stuff I didn't dig into my findings
So they're univited
Tell me do this, do that, do this do that do this
In order to sell this, you gotta pursue this type of program
I ain't no mascot for no massa
Like Mista Slave Driva some odd years ago and yo
O is not about to be between an imaginary tug-of-war
Feedin' me park style with bread like a pigeon
So I say, get your ears ready for creative control
Cause no one's gonna tell me how to sell out my soul hah (c'mon now)
Get your ears ready for creative control
"Ahhhhhhhhhh yeah, c'mon now!" (4X)
Cause no one's gonna tell me how to sell out my soul, yeah[Prince Po & Pharoahe Monch]
ORGANIZED DROP BOMBS!!

[Pharoahe Monch]
Guerrilla warfare like Vietnam
Elevate the mental into the temple of doom
Consuming maximum capacity so make room
Organized![Intro: Pharoahe Monch]
Yeah, yeah
I think, I think Prince should go first on this one
(You think so?) Yeah I think so
(I think so too, get it live)

[Verse 1: Prince Poetry]
Here we go again with the funky intro
People approach me knowin I'm the Prince Po-
-E-T-R-Y, yes and I'm the first batter
The Pharoahe usually go first, but it don't matter (Nah it don't matter)
Funky slices of beats like this
Comes once in a blue, but it's not hard for me to chew
So kick off your shoes and don't forget your socks
I wash and wash up emcees like Clorox
Skills I have, good and plenty
If you want dope lyrics plus ill gimmicks gimme
Beats, equivalent to this, something that I can
Float (float), float (float), float on
It's gettin breezy so kiddies'll keep ya coat on
When I proceed to light the party
In the summer, somethin like a Mardi
Gras, bikinis, panties, bras
Juicin em and I'm suckin the girls up like straws
Oops, upside ya dome
I don't answer the phone when I'm home not alone on the bone
Leave your name and your number and a brief message
At the end of the tone (Booop)
Oooooh, and I like it
Cause I'm Poetry the psychic
Intellectual lovable brother - nah, nah I don't like that
Yo yo scratch that (you can do better than that) one more time
Rollin lyrics, off the tip of my tongue (swing)
I swing (swing), I swang (swang), I swung (swung)
Bringin you the news like Connie Chung
But I'm not a pretty oriental specimen from
"Hong Kong Fooey, number one super guy"
I love the women but I don't try to see em
I'd rather make the money bein on the cover of EM
Get emcees mad make them flare up nostrils
I'm Poetry the rap fanatic I get hostile

Yeah (hostile, hostile, hostile)
Can I can I get a beat?
Yo, Pharoahe's up next yo, yo Monch
Kick it Monch

[Verse 2: Pharoahe Monch]
Pressure pressure pressure pressure pressure pressure cooker
I leave the party with a mass amount of hookers
Slip and slide, I sling the sludge
(Fudge) fudge (pudge) pudge, will never hold a grudge
Up against the wall, I caught you with the drugs
(The organisms are the jury) guess who's the judge?
(You!) I hit the hook heavy
Ready no chitter-chatter I figure since I'm bigger why pitter-patter
Prouncin on particular poets who persist to portray professional punks
You're just a pussy [meow]
Cat when I'm deckin you
Disrespectin you, clever whenever I select
A new dialogue, one plus one
Get it together, girls don't despair cause I'll be your
"Fair Weather Friend," friend
No I don't have a Benz and no I don't have an Infiniti
I figure the eight inches of meat will be the remedy
When I pull up to your bumper
Cause I'll be down to thump a girl like Heather Hunter
I tell you now you'll never hate it (hate it)
The triple X when it comes to sex is what I'm rated
I tell you now that I can give good love
Yes I'm the one you should love (tell us about it)
So don't try to diss Fudge Pudge
Cause it's alright, with, me
Kick slick rhymes out of the mouth
Tricky in a joust, plus I'm down with Mickey Mouse
C'mon everyone, lets flow to the rhythm of my tongue
To the rhythm of the drum
Emcees wanna battle but they can't get with the
Capital M-O-N-C-H on the mic I get swifter
Than the rest of them maybe even the best
Scoring 101 in a poetical test
So O.C., if you know who you are
Get on the mic become a superstar

[Verse 3: O.C.]
The form I signify is cultivated why spread it
Many many lyrics memorized embedded
In my think tank sharp as a shank knife
I strike the mic just as quick as a snake bite
Suck out the poison, yeah go 'head, try it
Skills of an assassin, watch as I'll fly
Thorough, doesn't matter the borough I'm swingin
Clear to the end keep the party people clingin
Treatin emcees like government cheese
Shred 'em like cheddar cut 'em up cause P's
Laid out on the bed while we write to the tracks
He's so funny when it comes to the snaps
Write a hardcore rhyme, that's what the boy said
I could whip up a rhyme that could slice a boar's head
No that's ham, and we don't digest that
Organism that's made of dog and a rat
So fee-fi-fum, everybody's Funky Drummin it
When you hear the bassline, you'll be hummin it
I'm keepin it simple cause I can swing many ways
Rappers get met, cause MET it pays
It's a mad mad world and it's best to never wild out
Go against me and I'm, quick to pull out
The driveway, by the way hey
Picked up your girl cause she was goin my way
Hand on the stick, foot on the clutch
Flowin over eighty miles per hour, I'll pull it on outta
Skid marks left on the ground like tattoos
The rubber smells badder than the doodoo on your shoes
You stink, better think wise is what I advise
Cause O.C. has skills to kill a whole tribe
Off, awkward, spaghetti I'll sauce it
Lyrics flow like fluid out of a faucet

[Outro]
Yeahhh...(adlibs), here we go (woo)
Here we go, here we go

To the organisms, to the organisms (repeat)So I react with a mic

[Intro]
Check it out so what we gonna do in this jam here
Is something a little different
We gonna shake 'em off the wild side
And then into the smooth side, then off of the smooth side
Right back into the wild side, then off of the wild side
Right back into the smooth side, then off of the smooth side
Right back into the wild side

[Verse 1]
Now listen up everyone
While I hip you to the scam about why I am the Funk Soul Sensation
I'm the Gifted, the O-N-E, the mystic, the gothic
To be specific I was terrific ???
I was a small sperm cell in my daddy's canal
Gave that ass a stimulating, blast straight up through his penal shaft
Ask my mother, she let the sperm cell gestate 9 months
But the funk couldn't wait
I came innate, she told me always to be early
That's why I ain't never late
Especially when I got a date with my fate
Dad sat me on his knee and told me "Be all that you can be"
I looked him straight up in his mug
And said "I wanna be an MC!"
And let the whole world sweat me
And my talent and the balance
I'm-a make sure that they don't ever forget me

[Hook x4]
I'm the Gifted One (I'm the Funk Soul Sensation)

[Verse 2]
I got the Theories of Relativity inside of me
Producing the juice to get you loose, measured by my hypotenuse
Multiplied by my square root to dope
You can't cope, you can't hang, check the slang
I kick the party get the bwoy buts
All from the jar of hot hard ball
Hurt you with your cole slaw
You said yeah you like it raw
Now you crying like a bitch
Saying you don't want no more
But that's cool cause the old school rule
I'm-a leave you facedown in the ditch covered with piss
Cause I'm relentless and heartless, and this will be your exodus
I mean, it's the word called relation between
Jemini the Gifted One
And the Funk Soul Sensation
Radiation ages through the mental incarceration
Makes the styles mingle causes social integration
Wack MC's don't get nothing but Fahrenheit degrees
They try to take flight, I take out all the
Energies and bring 'em to their knees
I leave them obliterated and incinerated
With that outdated lingo, niggas cater to the ego
But I ain't from around your way
Ayo somebody gots ta pay
To hell with Carlito, do it Jemini's way

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
I make everything better like season on meat
Like sugar sprinkled on your speaker, I make shit sound sweet
The Funk Soul Sensation is so sensational
Inspirational and educational, too
The 8th Wonder
Won't ever let no man put us under
But plunder, and ain't no where to run to
Cause you be six feet under
The thunder is coming down hard with black rains
So the High Plains Drifter got to lift a nigga
Out his jeep, like a 4/5th on the beat
Yeah I'm down for the slaughter but I'm really about
My daughter and my payday
I'm preparing for my old and grey days
I'm in my heyday, so mayday cause it's D-Day
You want to strike the mic but first get through the you and me days
Although, I'm really not the type of competition
I'll go, all out to put the key in your ignition
Don't revving your engine until your heart starts decision
Your vision make your decision and get ready for the head-on collision

[Hook x16]

[Outro]
Yo, I can dig that
Yes, I can dig thatPharoahe Monche:

Recognize me nigga, look into my eyes
See raw visualizations of hate reincarnated
In it's most unadulturated form I breathe evil incarnate
Only for the purpose to mislead, what was once promising seeds
Are now destroyed and misplaced with mischievious weeds for greed
The purpose, inseminate the bitches
Eliminate top rappers, throw their remains insides of ditches
Nigga political snitches, Abe me which is
The very reason I'm able to strike so vicious
Yea
Take these keys, that for years were not found
Allowing all Simeons to be freed thats locked down
It returns way back to the block
Only to cop more Smack, Rock from cops that act
Not in a manner for you to prosper
You are Ab-so-lete unless
You can handle the ball during a full-court press
When the weak emotion of love fails to bring hope
Kneel to your master nigga, invoke the strongest emotion
Known to mankind HATE!
Awww, you are sadly mistaken if you think my Aryan race
Can be taken out by the likes of you Apes, Kikes
Conservative nigga loving Gooks, Spooks, and Dykes
My Spikes, bald headed white laces
Braces the fact that I'm prepared for vicious acts of war
WHITE POWER!
HATE!

Mike:

What we have hear is a situation where our government
Is allowing these aliens to take over the country
We can't allow this to happen! Turn your bibles to Psalms 34:21
"Evil shall slay the wicked, and they that hate the righteous
Shall be desolate." You there!
Young man in the back with your hand up

Prince Poetry:

Who me?

Mike:

Speak

Prince Poetry:

A fucking taxpayer who salutes to a Confederate flag
My chain and thoughts is on the rag
Aryan ways learned from my grand-dad
I'm on my toes around these monkeys and spics
I thank God that I'm white, pure and don't mix
We need to snatch up these niggas and fags, reissue slave tags
Regain job positions, remain in control of opposition
Placed here to be the scum of the earth, serving us hand and foot
I'll rape 'em and slave 'and trade 'em from birth
Never to overlook the main crook who disperse shook
Versions of the bible, Sabotaging shit since Christophers arrival
Hate!
Making them Indian pay for survival
Now life for Ricans and Coons is homicidal
We Neo-Nazis seek nothing but world domination
God's plan is for us to seek and destroy man's false creation
It's exerted in the good book of Revelations
Set up to destroy spades and Jews from hidden stations
So my offspring's can end all this confusion for good
No more smooching off of welfare for jiggaboos in the so-called hood
Sickle cells decreasing your death rate, you black bitch
But I like the way you suck my wood
Germ grenades now in the form of A.I.D.S. were made to wipe you out
But now them queers got that shit semi-reversed running about
I'm off to college with a knapsack of sacrilegious artifacts
Notes from the Grand Dragon, swastika, three grams, two gats with HATE!* ironically, this is the second-to-last song on the album

[Prince Poetry]
Lemon to a lime, lime to a lemon
Confusin the men-tabolism in men and women with
Lyrical re-citals that I'm givin, some consider
Me an intellectual hip-hop transmitter

[Pharoahe Monch]
Lime to a lemon, a lemon to a lime
I flow to many.. rhythms, to many rhythms
I rhyme, off of the tempo, sim-pl-istic
But consequently distorts the instru-mentality
Causin an illusion
Organized, but at the same time, Konfusing

[Prince Poetry]
Wack emceeeeeeeeeeeees, your time is up!
Your rhymin suck (suck), on my stack
Your climbin up but not to par, Prince, Poetry posesses
The correct, literature showin you who the best is
Be-hold the Prince rose to the special occasion
Servin a bowl of Bran with the extra Raisin
Organized Konfusion blastin you with a
Missile, designed for a ripper, rippin up mics
For crowds just like any-body
Who rocks parties cause we carry Good-N-Plenty

[Pharoahe Monch]
Mmamamm-many mma-many many moons ago
When I reminisce I used to flow to slow
Beats, keepin the pace straight
Capital M capital O capital N capital C..
Cap-i-tal H, relates to a terrific
So never anticipate, on a specific style
When I stiplificate, my hieroglyphic file, wait
I'm the prolific child (these.. are..)
Styles are (simplistic) we (rhymes)
Like a lime (to a lemon) and a lemon (to a lime)[Verse 1: Pharaohe Monch]
Two Weeks before my old man busted up in her
My moms never walked slow
Now she smoke crack, sit back, and listen to talk shows
I hope she don't eat pork fried rice tonight
See, the cholesterol already got my arteries tight
I might select even before she injects her lethal chemicals
To wrap the umbilical cords around my neck
Shit, I'm pissin' in the abdomen
Two and a half weeks old, already thoughts of stabbin' men
Unravelin' plots and plans for thievin' and shit
Immune to the gospel, not believin' in shit
Where the fuck do I go from here
Cuz when the afterbirth disperse it's hard to persevere
I swear I can't fuck with it
She hits about two packs of cigarettes a day and I'm stuck with it
The asthmatic, internally scarred from crack addicts
Who share needles outside in the rain on Craftmatics
And laugh at it
I guess for them it seems funny but soon
I'll be the nigga who kills for petty money presume
Inside this temple of doom we throw the womb
I bloom to be emitted in june, considered a coon
Livin' my life incomplete though
On the edge of destruction, Invetro

[Hook x2]
I'd rather not be born
Than to be scorned in this world of hate
Where life escape me and stick with me like thorn
Wild like child porn
-ography, the autobi of the unborn

[Verse 2: Prince Po]
Overshadowed in darkness where curiosity is my light
Fear it but every coherent that there's a fifty percent chance that I might
Not make it in spite of the fact, it's my life
And can't take it, knowin' that I'm losin' this fight
To contradiction
The love with the hatred inviting friction
Umbilically inflicted, watchin' my life go down like Christion
Understand Mommy dearest is confused right now
But my faith brings us through someway, somehow
From now I vow to invest the livin', bow only to God
The coke's tokes and tell-lie-vision violence already got me scarred
Disregard what the devil allowed on my set
This city's number one threat, huh
Bet I could probably run for mayor on some shit like that one day
Or get my hustle on, just like my dad, quiet as kept for the long stay
Flow as a positive form to first step
I want some friends and a ill-ass fuckin' neighborhood rep
600 Benz gooseneck with a nakamichi system in it
Graduated from a rookie, rolled-up windows tinted
Desire presented for ice cream, big wheels, local rented movies
From Power Rangers, Lion King, Toy Story and Goonies
But the bomb, at least that's what I heard
Beyond my 9 to 5's I write a dope rap song
But with your insides gone; the vision is frail
Dreams can't set sail
From all that unprotected sex and cold Ballantine Ales
Oh well, I still prevail, God always has something in store for me
Outside this hell, move on
Torn in the eyes of Allah, scorned when the dawn distortion upon
My abortion clinic visit in the morn

[Hook x2]
I'd rather be born, shine as the true and livin'
Spawned to live this gift, to the fullest shit is on
Still rethinkin' my position until I'm gone
Mission is to elevate minds
Glisten, destined forever, weather the stormSpark that L!

Intro/Chorus: repeat 2X

We keep it koming
We keep it koming, huh
We keep it koming Spark that L!
We keep it koming, uhh
And when it's time to Organize
We stick together through the times
With the attitude like Miles
We keep it koming

Verse One: Prince Poetry

I be flipping the scripts, ripping through hoods coming equipped
Lifts out of my lyrics sippin forties in a whip
Organized, rise raise up the level surprise!
Niggas watch Prince, open your eyes when I deliver
Give a honeydip a wink, thick chocolate bitch
Switch up the pace, kick me the digits later you can taste
The bass thumps for months, entrapped in the lab
With mad blunts, creating formulas that you can grab
I escape, the clutches of wackness, I'm like a mattress
Lay it down for the South Side, Sounds of Blackness
Uh, ohhh, I keep it koming stunning you're running
Through states, to make pace gunning you down with the drumming
That rakes, in the dough
Oh, my God, times are hard so I gotta flow
Spark up the L, I excel over the stress
Crushing the competition that I stomp from East to West
Rest assured we will deliver the goods to the 'hoods
For the youth, this is proof we should
Well, Organize got the bomb hard to stay calm
Forming like Voltron and then attacking at dawn

Chorus

Verse Two: Pharoahe Monch

When I'm fed up, I hold my head instead of me teasing
Yo ooh ooh child, things are gonna get easier
In my mind and in my soul
I can take control of a beat whenever I roll
Stroll up the block, 40-dog cocked back
In my knapsack is a uzi-wop, BLACK WHASSUP!
Spreading like malaria, but much scarier
Migrating in the whole tri-state area
Without a doubt, my niggas never go out
They rock, braids and fades and baldies
And blow up and blew out throughout
The entire night I'm peepin you and
Your entire crew out -- what's that all about!
I suppose I be steppin to hoes when
I'm masking overconfidence, cause I know my new shit
Is gonna go platinum, I'm mathin em
Light skin ones inside of a Maxima
On a passenger side, this is what I'm asking her
Hey baby you look so good
Why you driving through our neighborhood?
If raps I wrote were cookies, I bet you'd bite a chip
Rookie fetch a product, cause it took a long time to ignite
A fucking style from the end, back to the beginning
Niggas is winning, Prince, niggas is winning
Keep the fat drumming running up your back
Black, with stacks of facts for the tracks
That you can react to

Chorus 1/2

Verse Three:

We be the bread and butter making breaking crown facts around back
Cracking gunner sound heart starts to stutter when the bass
Pounds butter, like this
Rumbling CD crispy, no hiss
Rush you like Russell, make you flip like Nipsey
Wilson negative but can't see, but maybe one
Organized take the favor rated is my tip
To keep my peers motivated with funk, only we rip see
For years tears shed it but never let it
Mislead a nigga figure that I'd be runnin dogs you know

Chorus

Nigga
Yeah, uhh
Check it out
Extreme phat, with the Pharoahe Monch cheeba cheeba
Mr. Prince Po will flow...Ladies, letcho batyflo (2x)

[Verse 1]
I'll make you feel like I'm the white knight in your dreams
On your window sill, on a blue moon beam
Have you based in, in your own juices
Loving that you gave the other men has been wasted, it's useless
My sexual potential is purely existential, when you frequently seduce
When I release the juice
With the precision of a chiropractor, when I tap the incision in your back
With my [?]
It's essential, I titillate the fibers of your essence
When expressin' what I feel in my sexual measures
That I sin, you'll always have a friend in me
That it's a sin to the point of dependency
Have you hooked on my magical wand
Dependin' like a fiend, you'll be seen in a methadone clinic
Give me your arm as I begin to embalm through the main vane
And tear the booty out the frame

[Hook]
Ladies, letcho batyflo
Jemini know the things that your man don't know
Ladies, letcho batyflo
And Jemini go the places that your man won't go

[Verse 2]
You can't wait 'til I penetrate your molecular structure (word)
Totally disrupt your lifestyle
Your molecules need to cool down a little bit
I see you breakin' fool with every corner that I hit
Every part of your body that I kiss will exist
In a state of heavenly bliss, don't resist
You'll only be cheatin' yourself out of the one thing
All the money in the world won't bring
As I gaze in your eyes, I'ma ask you
This one time, do you wanna climax?
I ain't got no time to be debatin', then liberatin'
Waitin' for somebody that I only been datin'
One month, don't front
Let me give you what you want
Classic orgasmic pleasure without measure
Ever been freaked so good a tear run down your cheek
And your knees get weak, you can't speak
And your lips get dry, and you begin to cry
Wonder why Jemini's so fly
I'm not only in it just for me
I love to see a woman in excruciating ecstasy, come on

[Hook]
Ladies, letcho batyflo
Jemini light you up like a Broadway show
Ladies, letcho batyflo
Jemini the type of brother to make the girls go "Ohhh!"
Ladies, letcho batyflo
Jemini go the places that your man don't go
Ladies, letcho batyflo
Cause Jemini know the things that your man don't know

[Verse 3]
I know you feel alone on your own
When your man come home
And he talkin' 'bout he tired
Cause his nerves all wired cause he just fired
Forget it, come and let me hit in the way he shoulda did it
(Well, I've got time if you've got time
But if I've got time, whatchu tryin' to say?)
Oh, you got time if I've got time
Since I've got time, what I'm trying to say
[?], Jemini can
Get mad fanfare from the one night stand
I believe to precede [?] need for me
To proceed and bust it down, make you bleed like a seizure
When I'm through breezing you down, you be weezing
Gaspin' for air, trying to breathe and believe in
In the bad man, cause I can rock well
I make the gaps swell, I go on like a Duracell
Give you hardcore and much, much more
The keys to my door, yo, come and explore
I wine you, dine you, let me remind you
Before we go, (letcho batyflo)

[Hook]
Ladies, letcho batyflo
Jemini, sunshine, make your garden grow
Ladies, letcho batyflo
Jemini know the things that your man don't know
Ladies, letcho batyflo
Jemini go the places that your man won't go
Ladies, letcho batyflo
Jemini light you up like a Broadway show
Ladies, letcho batyflo
Jemini the type of man to make the girls go "Ohhh!"

[Outro]
Yes, yes, y'all
You don't stop
Jemini, y'all[Q-Tip]
Yeah, check it out, we here with the big O
With the big big O, and you know
What we want y'all to do is just bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce
C'mon bounce, c'mon (c'mon we gotta) bounce
(C'mon, hah) Bounce (We do it like this one time, uhh, sup, sup)

[Verse One: Prince Po]
Do you wanna hear, the boogie bear
Jump up and do the freak funk, throw your hands in the air
Compare me, with none
The son, of the king, triple crown, just to get the job done
I surpass fast dash through a mass of traps fliers
And blow up the spot, and Organize on that ass, I'm hot
Black, with no sugar straight coffee
You stalk me, because your girl wanna hawk me
Jock me clock me watch me mutilate the mic
Rip it apart, shatter your brain when I strike
Add a syringe of raps to cleanse you fall apart
Style damage you amateur cause I'm blowin your file
Honey-dips see me and they yellin Organized
And they know -- Pharoahe Monche's got skills for the wise

[Pharoahe Monch]
Oh, huh, shit! Look who walked in the door
Ryu-kick, tiger tiger uppercut
Directly to the gut, when I strut on mics, makes my windpipe erupt
Better back off, I jack off of wack MC's in the vicinity
Nigga please, I make em bounce

[Hook: Q-Tip]
Let's organize, c'mon (we gotta bounce) we gotta bounce

[Verse Two: Prince Po]
I make you stomp back and forth like an army brigade
Diode cuts love kid wherever skills is displayed
Raid your block blow your mind like fans
In the summer or like Redman, ready to rock
Expanding my cleverness on wax, to Japan and back
Ask for Prince and hon I hope ya got
Just five seconds for black Prince to flex
It's not all about sex
I like ears smooth skin and sensitive necks
Victoria's Secret couldn't keep you from the Prince Poe
So peep it when I funky technique it
For those who slept, wake up, ya better make space
Taste the bread I break off, as I take it to your face! Whew
Can you keep up like skeleton watch Organized Konfusion troop up
Li-li-li-li-live with the style that's fly
Prince Po I, flow smooth like Silk so Freak Me
Cause I ain't Shai!
So, O.C., let em know how we go
Come again my friend with another funk flow
[O.C.]
Look who just came in, O.C.'s gamin
Crew's I set you up, to lynch for a hangin
Bangin, bodies up in a tree like a pinata
Many, claim masculine, but sport garters
Whose the artist, not video, more-so to Luke
It's like square dancing on your toes so bounce

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Prince Po]
Well here's a toke one time for you mind
Most just can't cope, dope def, booty nope I woke you up
I poke your brain I poke your main artery
Batter me, with your fattery your flattery will never ever shatter me
Prince Poe, the exec with the intellectual concepts
That elevates you like steps
A&R reps, take steps, bounce your ass through the hoods
Here's the goods, an ounce, enough for you to bounce

[Hook]
