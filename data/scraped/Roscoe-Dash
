[Hook: Roscoe Dash]
Girl the way you're movin', got me in a trance

Girl drop it to the floor, I love the way your booty go
All I wanna do is sit back and watch you move and I'll proceed to throw this cash

[Verse 1: Waka]
All that ass in your jeans

So I'mma make it thunderstorm, flood warning, Flocka yeah
Blowin' fuck it I don't care, jacksons flyin' everywhere
Tap my partner Roscoe like bruh, I'm drunk as hell can't you tell
Threw 70 bands, bet 50 stacks, oh fuckin well
I'm tryna hit the hotel with two girls that swallow me
Take this dick while I'm swallow Moscato got her freaky, hey

Pussy pop on her handstand, you got me sweatin', please pass me a fan, damn

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wale]
She said look ma, no hands and no darling I don't dance
And I'm with Roscoe, I'm with Waka, I think I deserve a chance
I'm a bad mothafucka, gon' ask some mothafuckas
A young handsome mothafucka, I sling that wood, I just Nunchuck 'em
And who you with? And what's your name? You not hip boo, I'm Wale
And that D.C. shit I rep all day, and my eyes red cause of all that haze
Don't blow my high, let me shine, Drumma on the beat, let me take my time
Nigga want beef we can take it outside
Fight for what broad, these hoes ain't mine
Is you out your mind? You out your league
I sweat no bitches just sweat out weaves
Wear out tracks, let me do my thing, I got 16, for this Roscoe thing
But I'm almost done, let me get back to it
Whole lotta loud and a little backwood
Whole lotta money, big tip I would
I put her on the train, little engine could, bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Roscoe]
R-O-S-C-O-E Mr. shawty put it on me
I be goin' ham, shawty upgrade from bologna
Them niggas tippin' good girl but I can make it flood
Cause I walk around with pockets that are bigger than my bus
Rain, rain go away, that's what all my haters say
My pockets stuck on overload, my rain never evaporates
No need to elaborate, most of these ducks exaggerate
But I'mma get money nigga everyday stuntin' nigga
Ducks might get a chance after me
Bitch I'm ballin' like I'm comin' off of free throws
Cause the head of the game no cheat codes
Lambo, Roscoe, no street code
And your booty got me lost like Nemo
Go, go, go, go, gon' and do your dance
And I'mma throw this money while you do it with no hands[Hook: Roscoe Dash]
Early in the morning when she’s all alone
I’mma take my time, do it how we want it
Just to set the mood, girl
I brought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay

[Kanye]
Hold up, hold up, hold up (etc.) yeah

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
She love the way I’m doing it (She do it)
So GOOD she won't put my tattoo on it
Bottom line is, you the finest
Gave you a new name, what's that? My bitch
Hold up, hold up, whoa there, let's capture this moment
If I hit it then I own it, marijuanin' every mornin
And patroning girl, we groaning
But that pussy got me feeling like a kid
With the street lights on, street lights on?
You know I gotta go in 'til it’s

[Hook: Roscoe Dash]
Early in the morning when she’s all alone
I’mma take my time, do it how we want it
Just to set the mood, girl
I bought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay (So just let the song play)
The long way, the strong way, it’s our day, it’s our way
This was all inspired by a little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Hold up, talk to the, talk to the hand
Bitch, you talking to a grown ass man
It’s like, way-way-way too much up in your pants
For us not to make the bed squeak (There goes the bed sheets)
Everybody rip the swag off 'fore I rip the tag off
Why my pants sag off? Cause I’m rapping my ass off
Flow so ugly, money so handsome
This the fucking anthem, get it? The fucking anthem

[Hook]

[Kanye]
I be saying I, uh, I think.. when I know, uh, just because..

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I don’t really wanna, uh, talk too much shit
But you love it when I talk like I lost it
And I love how you look when you blazin’
And I swear you turn at least half Asian
And we about to have a liaison
She so cool, give head with her shades on
You should just go and throw a cape on
And it’s just so amazing (So amazing, so amazing)

[Big Sean]
Take it to the car, bloop, bloop
That shit look like I’m speed racing
Leavin' with me, it’ll boost your reputation
West side is where I’m stationed
Spend all night, just champagne tasting
Ain't no rush girl, let's just pace it 'til it's

[Hook][Verse 1: Hopsin]
Welcome to the Ill Mind of Hopsin, where real life's an option
The ill lines that I spit make you realize you not sick
Science at its finest, tell Bill Nye to watch it
Now turn this shit the fuck up till you feel high and nauseous
Yo, check out this verse I wreck, I think I'm more cursed than blessed
No one seems to know if my brain's the result of birth defects
I need a solution, pastors tell me that church is best
But they'll look at me devilish cause I'm how they interpret death
Everybody's always acting fake, rappers I hate be asking to collaborate
It's sad to say but it's the truth, that instead of trying to congratulate
They got they hands out like we playing a game of Patty Cake
But that ain't what I'm focused on
The day I step up in the lab with a sell out will be the day all hope is gone
The game's filled with a bunch of faggots who don't belong
Always claiming they real niggas but I ain't notice one

[Verse 2: Roscoe Dash]
Where the fuck'd he come from and why is he here?
Dressed in some dope shit your stylist probably would wear
Look like Egyptian hieroglyphics set shit off in his hair
And the message is no one in this day or time could compare
Practice makes perfect, I practiced my whole life
Far from perfect but my worst shit is lapping em all twice
But like I put the "I" in win, cause I did it my whole life
So your first place or second statistics are all hype
I'm all flight, no really, I'm all flight
I live in the sky and get higher than four kites
If your girl like my music, don't worry it's alright
The day we meet'll never happen, my hours are all night
I work hard, pay off, plus the evidence, nigga
All my pockets best friends with Dead Presidents, nigga
Right hook the whole world, throw your bell for these niggas
No wonder they kept a spot on double X L for a nigga

[Verse 3: Machine Gun Kelly]
When I come around, people smell trouble
I don't fuck with Photoshop, so holler at me when you wanna see a real jungle
The Eastside where fiends huddle
Outta towners come across them potholes stumbling, make their knees buckle
Street signs'll read struggle
Every couple months another shirt with R.I.P's and we love you's
Instead of leaving school my friends are leaving out in a duffel
I bleed hustle, why the fuck I need muscle, run tell them that
I'm going in like needles in war wounds
Kids at the dorm rooms, syringes and harpoons
Summertime hot couple months before June
And have star power while in the planet below moon
Now that's classic, and with all of this wackness
Crowd for providing this track here it's madness
Without a witch and some spells I made magic
Motherfucking monster, Lake Placid, Kells
Bring that shit back, bring that shit back, now bring that shit back
Lace up, uh
I'mma consider this class brother, now learn something
A pocket roll, a E-Z Wider, a filter, a little hash so I can burn something
Just to help you cope a little bit more
Cause round here tomorrow isn't for sure
And we coming up from mistake on the lake, double O
Bag it up, then we wake as we bake, Double O's
Burning up, then we making the cake, double stoves
Then I hop up out the bitch with hella bread like a dozen loaves
That's money, biatch!

[Verse 4: Future]
Coke Boys, something like Montana
With the bird gang like Santana
Real street nigga repping for Atlanta
Ain't dropped but I'm still in the Phantom
And I blow that money fast like a candle
Yeah, and I still got stamina
Let my lil homie do you on camera
Yeah we ain't nothing but some animals
Got a house and a condo in Miami
What you doing, what you do for the fucking Grammy
I do what it take for the paper chase
Freestyle, off the dome, whatever it take

[Verse 5: Danny Brown]
Ho, the only thing you gotta know
My dick’s tucked around when I’m sitting on the flo'
You think I'm gon' fall off, got advice for you, homes
Fall asleep in your car, in the garage, with the engine on
Playing Ping Pong with your bitch jaws
You the type to have a sing-a-long in Superman drawers
I got a redhead ho, call it Molly Ringwald
She like to take a mount of Molly and bring Adderall
Sipping white wine til the sun set
Before it got dark, she already got naked
Then she start to neck it, then she got reckless
Rump shaker, Wreckx-N-Effect it
Bum stiggedy bum stiggedy bum, Das EFX shit
Left her bum sticky, fell asleep on the terrace
Me on the beat, that's a hate crime
With black ink, I murder white lines[Verse 1]
Let me set the stage for ya
Cause you know I like it when I dance for ya
Been anticipatin' when you make it over
Furniture rearranged, I need some space open
Ooh, you lose your mind every time
Life's crazy ain't it
We should party on it
Lifestyle's finally changing, (damn)
Feels like something's going
All live entertainment
Champagne's finally pourin'
And baby, baby, I swear
Close your eyes I'm taking you there

[Pre-Hook]
These flashing lights
I'll let you love me, cause I can tell that you want me
Just you and I
Body to body we gettin' out of this party
Flashing lights
I'll let you love me, cause I can tell that you want me
Just you and I

[Hook: Tinashe (Roscoe Dash)]
Feels like Vegas don't it
Feels like Vegas don't it
Feels like Vegas don't it
Feels like Vegas don't it
Feels like Vegas don't it
(Life's crazy ain't it)
Feels like Vegas don't it
(In the sky, that's crazy ain't it)
Feels like Vegas don't it
(We should party on it)
Feels like Vegas don't it
(In the sky, that's crazy ain't it)
Feels like Vegas don't it

[Verse 2]
How you like it, throw me on the bed
Show me how, to love you the right way, hey
When you're runnin', and I just can't take no more
You go even harder and we end up on the floor
Hey, feelin' on my body
Love it when I call you daddy
Telling me go come get it
I say "baby, I'm ready"
Every kiss getting wetter
Money can't buy this pleasure
I say "baby I'm doin' better, yeah"

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]

[Break] (x2)
Hypnotised by the flashing lights
Flashing lights, flashing lights
Flashing, flashing, flashing lights

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook][Intro: Roscoe Dash]
It's goin' down tonight, baby
Haha, yeah (DJ Drama!)

[Verse 1: Roscoe Dash]
I got sand all by my bath water, candles by my wine glass
Women all on my time - imagine how my time pass
They say them freaks come out at night, and you know who they came to see
Even though she ain't mine, I fucked her like her man to be

[Hook: Roscoe Dash]
So many girls in here tonight
So many girls in here tonight
I'm just lookin' for the right one, exotic as they might come
Better leave with two cause really I don't like one
So many girls in here tonight

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Ah! Light skin, dark skin, sit your fine ass right there
Come join at my table and don't question when tonight end
Toss a couple dollars and she down for whatever
Make no promises but promise I could fuck you better
Fuck that singing shit, I be the shit, that YM, too legit to quit
You thinkin' that you better then that Venus and Serena shit
I'm all up up on my ladies chick, she saying it's the greatest dick
I one-two stroke her; we caught up in the moment, aye
T-t-turn up, V-12 and I burn up
My chick that fly bitch and your bitch unheard of
4 AM and we still poppin' bottles
Probably have a new chick tomorrow cause there's so many...

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Wale]
(Yeah, Wale though, Double M Genius.. yeah)
I put my problems in this pitcher, got a bucket full of liquor
And I know ya'll got that bad bitch but y'all got way too many niggas
What's your phone numb', Tyga got some roll up
Loud pack with your bad ass cause these good girls just ain't no fun
Double cup and I'm slowed up, smokin' dub with my chauffeur
Sneaka fly, hitta stylin', I'm the reason why you nigga's foamed up
New York and my slow bucks, DC got that old cup
Hold up, these nigga's want no bucks
Straight shot sipper - I ain't mixing my liquor
Bitch I'm not kidding, ya'll some Fisher-Price nigga's
And we some life livers hopin' that this life give us
A lot of money, success, and a woman to ride with us
Ambition (Ralph, Genius)

[Hook][Hook]
Light skinned, dark skinned, bottom right, top heavy
Jeans fitting right, hair did, shawty you the best

You the one girl, you the one girl
Something bout them jeans that you wearing
Something bout them jeans that you wearing
Yeah you got that body of a goddess
You got no competition you got it
You make me wanna say oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my

[Verse 1 - Fabolous]
I got one in Miami, she mean with a mouth piece
Like LeBron, I’m taking my talents down to South Beach
Pineapple to chase it, go on girl just taste it
All we drink is my shit, coco loso wasted
Love that lil waist shit, damn them hips just sit out
Now I see who all these hating girls be talkin’ shit bout
From the front looking like she got some ass probably
They say that’s a sign girl: ass-trology
Tight denim with them little rips in ‘em
"Wait in line" jeans, take a minute to get in ‘em
BBD say you poison well I want some of that venom girl, girl

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Wiz Khalifa]
Ooooh, girl your ass is superthick
Lotta chicks off in this club and you the baddest in this bitch
Ooooh, look at what you wearing girl
The club owner should pay you whenever you make an appearance
And you got me hooked, I might try not to look but I keep staring
Come out to my city see, I run that bitch like errands oooh
Grown as hell I don’t care to choose
Who’s coming, you, her and you
Roll this up, after you hit this once, you’ll need a parachute
To tell the truth I’mma tear the roof
Out that muthafucker nail it too
Loud pipes, hear the coupe, vroom, got stripes like a general
You know I’m tryna get into you

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Roscoe Dash]
Now you the baddest that I’ve seen in the club all night
Girl, your booty had me stuck like a drug all night
Damn, girl I really wanna put it on you like a coaster
Love how you moving over there but I really want you closer
Let get drunk off this Moscato, do it like there’s no tomorrow
Wake up and if it’s up we’ll do it like theres no tomorrow
Jump on it, I want it, he on it, bone it
Whenever she want it
R-O-S-C-O-E Dash dismantling every component
Girl you the one, too bad I’m not a cuffer
She love the way the rapper tastes, too bad I’m not a sucker
She call me when she need it
And I’mma come running to feed that appetite I do it anyway she want itOhhh o ohhh yeaaa yeaaa roscoeee

And if I drive that pussy wild then she gon' be my rider

She be smiling cuz she love a nigga style
So I’m the only she let drive around, im like...

Only reason why I remember
Cause I was looking up at them stars
When her head was glued to my lap
She ain't even talk or look back
She did her thing, she dipped out, and she ain't even want no dap
Got damn I love that ho for that
She always welcome back
So good I'd pay if I was lame
But I ain't so back to my rap
Damn I'm drunk I need breakfast
Got another bitch like 3x's
Away from here but she crazy she'll get all clingy, started, then reckless
And I'm just not go be able
To fuck with her or that fable
Got a bachelor pad with a maid who
Keep steak and shrimp on my table

Even for the dumb and distasteful
And them lames who love to hate you

Furniture rearranged, I need some space open
Ooh, you lose your mind every time

Champagne's finally pourin'

Close your eyes I'm taking you there

[Pre-Hook]
These flashing lights

[Verse 2]
How you like it, throw me on the bed
Show me how, to love you the right way, hey
When you're runnin', and I just can't take no more
You go even harder and we end up on the floor
Hey, feelin' on my body
Love it when I call you daddy
Telling me go come get it
I say "baby, I'm ready"
Every kiss getting wetter
Money can't buy this pleasure
I say "baby I'm doin' better, yeah"

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]

[Break] (x2)
Hypnotised by the flashing lights
Flashing lights, flashing lights
Flashing, flashing, flashing lights

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]How they let me go and get a beat from kane
I swear these 808s & snares make me go insane
Aye hold up baby girl I really wanna know your name
And let me be your superman & you be Lois Lane
It's showtime like cable, get up on that table
I love your sexy body & I know you love this paper
Bottles coming like they got legs on 'em
The way I kill 'em man this beat will make 'em wanna call the feds on me

CHORUS
I'm orderin' a hundred shots of patron
Girl you better get a cup
And once I get you home
Girl you better give it up
And we gon' have a good good night
Good night, good night
Good night
Good night
We gon' have a good night
Good night, good night
Good night
Good night

I got an open palm with cash in it
I could be up for mvp
I'm just tryna out do my last visit
Pockets fat like they pregnant
And 'bout to have triplets
I got 20s flyin' send ghetto benji to adlib it
Hah, get it, I'm so far ahead of my time
No C-section
Y'all club we v.i.p section
Party bus full of women

Like weed next to me
Woulda thought it was a gym the way we flexin'
Line full of sexy ladies tryna get with me
I'm just tryna grand slam like the boy Ken Griffy
And I'm at the bar nine shots no fifty
'Bout to bring a hundred more
Errybody get tipsy

CHORUS

We gon' have one hell of a time
Girl I am feeling fine
You know what's on my mind
Give it up
This mad in my swisher got me fine
Your sexy little body got me stuck so what's really good
Girl I wish we really could do what we really should
I know your last boyfriend was only really good
Well I'm excellent a sexual perfectionist
I creep up behind ya deep inside ya no exorcist
That's that extra shit , real long extra thick
A different type of breed a upgrade from that metric shit
It's time to make ya question all the rest ya messin' with
I'm tryna tell ya I'm the one to hit the exit with

CHORUS

That's what we like to call a good night

We gon' have a hell of a time
Girl I am feelin' fine
You know what's on my mind
Get it up
This mad in my swisher got me fine
This switch on got my mind
Your sexy little body got me stuck so what's really good[Hook: Roscoe Dash]
I be over here, I be over there
You be on the outside wishin you were here
I be at the club, I be at the spot
You be talkin big but you really, really not
Cause you ain’t me and I ain't you
I ain't even gotta try, this is what I do
Cause you ain’t me and I ain't you
I ain't even gotta try, this is what I do
This is what I do

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
This is how my day go
Wake up, cross over, fade ho
I wake up with that leggo, 28th floor but I lay low
No lease ‘cause it’s paid fo, stack chips with my queso
Straight shots no hangover, real bitches, no fake hoes
Two chicks in Barbados, we bake O's like begals
Hasta luego, pasta alfredo
Authentic Italian linguine, Pasta, no Prego
Call me lieutenant, riding in a whip windows tinted
Got a tour bus with a room in it, loud pack, no stems, no seeds in it
When I ride on the beat, man I groove in it, hell yessir, I handle bussiness
I'm so prolific, it's no impostor-ing and no pretending

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Roscoe Dash]
Do it, do it, I did it, did it; it’s done, it's done, it’s finished, finished
Since I gotta put in that overtime gotta make that mine - I spin it
Man I got hits on hits on hits so why the hell they keep on pitchin
Got a whole lot of haters who don't '@' me when they mention
My music is like a drug man I’m just filling another prescription
I'd duck school and put the beat it at the school dentention
Call me Captain Hook, man absolute, murder make me a burger
I’m so further like some place that you ain’t hurt the pound working
See I gotta handle my business, I am so ambitious
I got big dough, that's biscuit, 30 knots ain't trippin'
So when I walk around that’s fitness, I passport when I visit
Overseas ball no pivot, you talk about it and I live it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: B.o.B]
Since day one you heard me from the underground to the surface
I rose out of the fire, I emerged out of the furnace
But I knew that my time would come, And I couldn't be more deserving
Man I swear I'm good for life, but still I'm far away from perfect
Shit I’m straight like 12:30, I'm eatin' good, Im burping
Chillin with brown sugar and cinnamon, one butter scotch and one Hershey (Good God)
With a booty so big you can probably Google Earth it
I’ma hit it girl with that long jump, With that Jackie Joyner, that Kersee
Now squirt for me, twerk it for em
I’m the professor of Real Nigga University
I hold my team down, anchorman Ron Burgundy
I’m tryin tell you man, I'm sharper than surgery
Bobby Ray!

[Hook][Tony Yayo:]
Fuck state greens, I'm tryna cake bitch
Quarter key, I'm ballin' key Blake Griff
Jet ski, black sand, bad bitch
My passport need pages for the next trip
Fall asleep we got the cars that your ass dream of
Kush loud pack bet ya bitch blow some steam off
I keep the ruger under the rug beanies
Hoes here the rumors and they love me, love me
Fast cars, loose women, the high life
We bust bottles smoke weed all night
Hermeez cost as much as the gators sole

[Hook x2: 50 Cent]
All we do is stunt and blow the paper, the paper
The balling make a hater wanna hate us, the haters
Can't take it when they see the money makers, we make a
Whole lotta money, whole lotta money

[Shawty Lo:]
Shawty lo I hear ya hating us
All that small talk I love laying up
Yea dey know, me and yayo
In the ny, hitting yayo
Bitch better have my money
Wanna gain up now it's steady as a diamond
Got the bitch naked like new jack city
Kinda remind me of monday in magic city
Bitch I'm shawty, bornhome shawty
Westsides on boy bankhead shawty
Bitch I'm with it, bought a whole ticket
And I got the whole gggggggggg unit with me, 50

[Hook x2]

[Roscoe Dash:]
Attracted to the money like bees on honey
My swag on dummy, cash on runny
I'm way more than what you asked for hunny
Knock it all collection plate from the last 4 sundays
I'm I'll, hold the pills, my skill, is so for real
Watch the candy rain fall
I'm on her brail, playas so real
I'm on a whole nother plato
Lean back back fat joe
I ain't got time to be concerned with you assholes
Status outrageous, I'm on to y'all haters
I'm so far ahead, I'm sitting down waiting
I feel your frustration for my very last statement
I'm

[Hook x2]Oh, ohhh, uh I don't keep track of my accomplishments But honor all my compliments, Cause' I don't get em often, man this game's so full of politics Working every night because I'm too much of a novelty Quitters don't succeed plus, who the fuck is topping me? They say I'm underrated, I'd agree with that They also say that patience is a virtue, I believe in that They say that my lyrics going soft, ohh I needed that And now on every song that I knock off, make sure you keep in track When I was young I had hoop dreams, now I got it like that Damn, I never knew the groupies would be poppin' like that Now them lame ass niggas tryna copy my swag They gon' make me go dumb and you don't wanna do that Nooo when I lose it, my flow goes stupid And everyone around gon' be bumpin' my music Those who said I couldn't do it, gon' be looking so stupid Then the radio gon' play me all day, every day cause' they know They know, they know, they know They know, they know, they know They know, they know, they know Why you looking so surprised? Every single time they play my song in the club, The club come alive, they better act like they know They know, they know, they know I'm so awesome on everything, that you can't deny They asking, "How the hell he make it look so easy?" Tell em don't apologize, happens all the time I'll try and not to make my winners speech so lengthy But you know that it's gonna overdue I been doing what I'm supposed to do I'll do whatever the fuck I wanna do Straight like that, it's been a long time since I ate like that Gotta thank y'all because y'all made me a snack (?) That's just the way that they go when the world is so traditional It's pitiful, cause' these typical, Semi-jurisdictional, epitomes with no abilities Tryna stop me from reaching my pinnacle, but really they know! They know they ain't even got it like that They be placing, you ain't even really poppin' like that Now these lame ass niggas wanna copy my swag When they know there's no comparing, they be swearing But it's something they know They know, they know, they know They know, they know, they know They know, they know, they know (?)

Travi$ Scott
Verse:1

This a new world no rules, just hop in my spaceship and lets cruise
See the whole galaxy like we on strooms, burning all the gas might get high off the fumes
A couple more toastes of these damn mimosa's, I keep her legs spread like she fuckin moses
I leave her back bent a lil scoliosis, lift off hit the perc's
Bake bake a lil cheese your pockets need to gain a lil weight, we one of the stars I took her on a play date we speaking a language that nobody can translate
She see the earth then froze if you scared of heights, then baby keep them eyes closes
Feeling like biggie cause money ain't a thing, might need more champagne cause some niggas can make it rain[Hook: Roscoe Dash]
We popping bottles of the pink shit, take 'em to the dome
We ain't ever on that weak shit, all we blow is strong
Every day we party til early in the morn
Put that shit on Instagram so they know I'm putting on
I know you see me, yeah, I be putting on

[Verse 1: Wale]
I know you see me with your looking ass
What the fuck you looking at?
This is MMG and we don't speak to all you fucking crabs
Got a bunch of cash, but money is under, fam
I'd rather be over-prepared than slip in here understaffed
Did you understand I'm down to ride with my niggas
Just a double M, you can't fuck with them
Unless you're certified to ride with us
Keep the broads far up out my business and my mind following the ditches
And I ain't tripping off of potential -- that's another word for "ain't did shit"
Work, and I put D.C. on, we ain't been this high since the E.R
See y'all niggas be some peons, talking about y'all be gone
Whole time niggas wouldn't swing, playing tee-ball

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Hundred thousands, hundred thousands, I be throwing hundred thousands
I know why they trusting me -- cause I got all these funds around 'em
My fan base consist of niggas with drugs around 'em
Educated sisters to bitches dancing with ones around 'em
I know you think all we do is have fun around here
But I'm from a city where young niggas carry guns
Don't single out any corner -- its popping on every one
They talking bout what they gon do, its probably already done
I'm running through cake, running through states
Take your one to the face every one or two cakes
Just bought a new crib, that's a wonderful space
Ask me how I feel I got it so my nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3: French Montana]
I be cooler than a motherfucker
Wanna hit the fans, selling work on the Internet -- call it Instagram
And you know I do it for my city, you know I'm putting on
Hundred racks on this clothes a nigga putting on
Self made, self paid, forty on my belt waist
Hundred round lobster feast, get a shell face
I be twisted off of molly doe, chopped bricks karate doe
Closet two floors -- safari doe
Brown bag paper tag, nigga can't pay for swag
We know we love the game but we hate to brag, Montana
Me and Rozay twisted on a boat, watching all you fuck niggas chokeI have all the swag, body bag
Life’s a fucking party, I’m wasted, someone call a cab
Stumbling to the car but they keep asking for autographs
I’m going home with girls, girls, girls, yup, all of that
Tell me is it the fame or the money
Either way this people all think there must be something about me - stunning
Ah, everythang (I’m juiced up, I know the truth stuff)
Cause everything I do is just actually too much
For y’all niggas
Oh yeah and I’m awesome over all niggas
Motherfucking dimes, I can’t even see you small niggas
So pardon me (please)
I don’t mean to brag
But I just spent 40,000 yen on these jeans I have
On baby
Oh yeah money long baby
You just .. your makeup on the waistline of my draws
I mean oh you can be the inspiration for my next song
Just motherfucking do with me and bust jimmy johns
I’m the bomb dot com
Shout out to my moms
It's Been a long time coming and we still going strong
We win it, can’t let up
Cause once these clowns forget us
It's gonna take a lifetime trying to make them unforget us
So I’m gonna represent us
From start and to the finish
I work hard to pay off
Ball - I gets the play off
You used to ball too, until you got laid out
Back in 95s damn I bet that's chaos
Life’s about lessons, sit back and watch me teach
Like a game of badminton, I’m so out of reach
I’m at the finish line, give my winning speech
It goes "ahem , um"
But all y’all said I couldn’t do it
I hope every time you grab a … you forced to hear my music
You’re so cubic, I’m so coolest
Got your girlfriend playing nudest
I’m, with no script, but I don’t trip
Trust me I give a bat pri sa , means like aristocrat
No lady and the tramp but they were gifted cats we tripled that
I used to have problems, until I learnt to deal
I was taught to stay positive and always keep it real and I do
I do, I do, I do, I do
Oh, oh, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do

Chorus :
I was taught to always keep it real it when I do
What I do, and I do, and I do, and I do, and I do (3x)

Do It

K La :

Stumble in the elevator, drifting down the highway
Drunk texed all my numbers, don’t know who the fuck is calling
Feeling extra reckless I could probably use some counseling
It’s a party at the condo, I don’t really feel like talking
Feel like killing the party and these hoochies in Air Jordans And pissing off all the bitches who wish that they could afford them, See um Don’t brag a lot
Cause when you, have a lot
You don’t, talk about it
You just, laugh a lot
And you just, walk it out, pop it out and stock it out, but ya'll bitter bitch ass haters don’t know what I’m talking bout
Do you? Cause I do
The best I can me and my crew - the best of friends
And the niggas that ride for me will put to sleep the best of me
And stay in your place, pass the ace, and put a smile back on your face
Cause it’s a blessing to be next to the best dressed bitch up in this place
But I failed to mention that , um , I do this shit
While you other candy-coaters on that other .. box of goober shit
I rap ... sing and do it on another box of .. shit
And if you ask my haters probably tell you I’m a super bitch
Yeah , uh huh, that's cause I do this shit Cause I do it so right, and I do it so good
And I do it just like I said I would
Cause I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
I was taught to always keep it real it when I do
*what* I do, and I do, and I do, and I do, and I do (2x)
What I'm Supposed To DoI just wanna party till I can’t no more
Buy all of the bottles 'till there ain't no more
Tonight I’m going in like it’s my last
Tell them keep em coming you ain’t even, you ain’t even gotta ask
Tell them keep em coming
Keep em coming, keep em coming, keep em coming

It’s the Friday time I party man the night's long
Club full of women just like I like them
Which should I drive, the black or the white one
I be shinning it like day in the night time
I gotta go and pick up my partner
He designated to drive
Cause I might get too intoxicated
Tonight might just be that night
I feel like buying out the whole bar
Make them hit the store to get more
We celebrating y'all hesitating
What the fuck is you waiting for
I said don’t worry about us running out
We got stupid bottles, plenty loud
Stupid Benz and we kick them out, and we reckless man so its going down
I say grab a cup, fill it up, throw it back and pour another one
We going in, we on ten, can’t stop now, the party just begun

I just wanna party till I can’t no more
Buy all of the bottles 'till there ain't no more
Tonight I’m going in like it’s my last
Tell them keep em coming you ain’t even, you ain’t even gotta ask
Tell them keep em coming
Keep em coming, keep em coming, keep em coming

Keep em coming, keep em coming all night long
I’m just looking for a cutie I can take home
I just want the dj to play the right song
Can’t fight the feeling, fight the feeling
Cause the feeling strong
I’m on the....and buscato
I’m watching while she grind
She got me fantasizing, I’m bout to lose my mind
I whisper in her ear, she put my hand on her behind
I asked her what she trying to do
She said she trying to ride
Trying to hit her and her partner
20 piece, 2 dimes
They thinking I ain’t down for it
I'm upright, on time
I got a head full of intentions
I said Misses I’m gonna try
I'm drunker than a fool
Man it’s going down tonight, let’s go

I just wanna party till I can’t no more
Buy all of the bottles 'till there ain't no more
Tonight I’m going in like it’s my last
Tell them keep em coming you ain’t even, you ain’t even gotta ask
Tell them keep em coming
Keep em coming, keep em coming, keep em coming[Hook:Roscoe Dash]

Now we party hard, extra cake, I throw it up and watch it elevate

The way these white guys dance around, you would have thought they ain't dead
But now we ain't for trainin they flyin out, they got these ladies tryin to scout
Like it's playoff time, and in our time, left on the clock with a tied score

Now, Now my name ring, my chain bling, got sparkles over my champagne
My bitches bad, these niggas mad, I guess it's just what the fame brings
Brooklyn boy get plenty love, on the turnpike with my Philly broad
Miami bound with my D.C. chick and we let it fly when we in the club
I'm worldwide I'm certified, pop a bottle my Cali dime
Photogenic, windows tinted, what type of car the Ferrari kind
I'm on the grind never slowin' up, popping cash I'mma throw it up
Haters watch while I do it up, THE REMIX BITCH I'm BLOWING UP!

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
Ok now hold up, swole up, my bank roll it don't fold up
Hate me nigga so what, twenty grand for me to show up
Next month I want that plus, money long as your tour bus
Hit the club and I let it fly, claim you balling nigga telling lies
Step in the club and it's all eyes, champagne I sip mine
Ball out, ball hard, you can't cause it's rent time
Straight G's on my front line, seven-fifty got Alpine
Blowing bands in that strip club, count it up in your down time
HA!

[Hook: Roscoe Dash]

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
K O D, M I A, twenty racks, let it fly
That's your man? Excuse yourself, be polite, tell him bye
Hoes know when we in this bitch we make it rain it ain't never dry
Ciroc cups, Cali kush, everybody 'round me hella high, Ha!
Where Maino at? In my new whip with the same old strap
Red beam on it like Kano back, high price for the volcano rap
Put my name on that and the hood go crazy, and the hood go crazy
It's double MG but I'm 'bout that Cash Money like Baby
BITCH!

[Verse 4: Jim Jones]
Bow our heads, say our grace, make it out the hood was Amazing Grace
Forty on the lap just to play it safe, Rollie on ice with the plain face
Tell me how the life with the fame taste? Tell me slow down cause it ain't a race
Bought two cars on the same day, fuck two broads on the same night
Fucked your broad cause my game tight, sit ringside at the main fight
Brand new Airs cocaine white, feels so good but it ain't right
Ha! Ha! Ha! Had ten minutes to make the flight
I told the pilot, let it fly, I'm in BK and I'm in Bed-Stuy

[Hook: Roscoe Dash]

[Verse 5: Wale]
Ok, Polo with no horse though, D.C. well of course though
My whores go when they throat hurt, I switch heads Lee Corso
Game tight with that flow love, Maino well like four jonks
I'm out BK with these fast girls and all my cash good I miss slow bucks
Make a straight lame Joe open up, Tory Burch and she know what's up
No coach bag if I go with that, snake skin tote that cobra clutch
Dough ain't nothing to joke about, she open up when that dough come out
I might bless a chick, say yes a little, but I'm optimistic I'm a throw a knot
WALE!

[Hook: Roscoe Dash][Hook: Roscoe Dash]
They ain't never seen a nigga do the shit that I did
They ain't never seen a nigga driving nothing like this
I got haters, I got jockers all over my swag
I'm just, I'm just doing me, I don't know why they all mad
Here I go, they staring like they don't know what a star is
Everyday's a movie, we just don't know what the call it
I'm everywhere you'll never be, that's everywhere the bread at
I bet my haters pissed, they wishing that they never said that

[Verse 1: Roscoe Dash]
Cause now, they know I can
Everything I'm on is a hit, nigga know the jam
Track long, flexed up, yeah you know I am
Juice gang, ah yeah that's the fucking team
? you're a wannabe
Money in the bank and money all in front of me
Drive what I want, and fly where I wanna be, honestly
Honestly, we don't even drive at all
? Who I'm trying to call
? Yeah we go and buy them all
Pop bottles, get wasted with the finest broads, yup
That's boss shit
I should've played lacrosse cause I run it all day call me Matt Danowski

[Hook]

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Put my hands up, let me testify
Swear to god, I'm trying to make her legs touch the sky
You wanna save her, I just let her by
Aye, nigga straight up like the letter I
Shake them haters off of me, awfully
I can fuck your girl if she's right here and I was across the street
I can do this on and off the beat, do it constantly
Getting money's, that money with an apostrophe
Period, my girls legs look like parenthesis
And the chain so icey, should've came with a pair of skis
Let them sneeze uh, bet you ain't got a pair of these
And when the old school candy came with a pair of D's, let's go
Smoking on that petro, these Gucci shoes is retro
Trap house, on the same street as ?
Hair low, holler, dollar after dollar
Model after model, bottle after bottle

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Roscoe Dash]
Every twenty four hours it's the same shit
Them haters get back up on the same shit
I be swishing all day like a can't miss
Them niggas find out we fucking with the same chick, whoa
So they try and do what I do
Like I see them and they try to
Money lower then the IQ
Imma' get money,tycoon
Got a million downloads on iTunes
Never heard nothing like what I do
Bet these strippers wanna suck till their eyes blue
?
Yeah, boss shit must I remind you
Got more ones then a blind jew
Get money, get money when it's time to
That's how it goes when the Juice is behind you, but um

[Hook][Hook: Roscoe Dash]
Early in the morning when she’s all alone
I’mma take my time, do it how we want it
Just to set the mood, girl
I brought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay

[Kanye]
Hold up, hold up, hold up (etc.) yeah

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
She love the way I’m doing it (She do it)
So GOOD she won't put my tattoo on it
Bottom line is, you the finest
Gave you a new name, what's that? My bitch
Hold up, hold up, whoa there, let's capture this moment
If I hit it then I own it, marijuanin' every mornin
And patroning girl, we groaning
But that pussy got me feeling like a kid
With the street lights on, street lights on?
You know I gotta go in 'til it’s

[Hook: Roscoe Dash]
Early in the morning when she’s all alone
I’mma take my time, do it how we want it
Just to set the mood, girl
I bought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay (So just let the song play)
The long way, the strong way, it’s our day, it’s our way
This was all inspired by a little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Hold up, talk to the, talk to the hand
Bitch, you talking to a grown ass man
It’s like, way-way-way too much up in your pants
For us not to make the bed squeak (There goes the bed sheets)
Everybody rip the swag off 'fore I rip the tag off
Why my pants sag off? Cause I’m rapping my ass off
Flow so ugly, money so handsome
This the fucking anthem, get it? The fucking anthem

[Hook]

[Kanye]
I be saying I, uh, I think.. when I know, uh, just because..

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I don’t really wanna, uh, talk too much shit
But you love it when I talk like I lost it
And I love how you look when you blazin’
And I swear you turn at least half Asian
And we about to have a liaison
She so cool, give head with her shades on
You should just go and throw a cape on
And it’s just so amazing (So amazing, so amazing)

[Big Sean]
Take it to the car, bloop, bloop
That shit look like I’m speed racing
Leavin' with me, it’ll boost your reputation
West side is where I’m stationed
Spend all night, just champagne tasting
Ain't no rush girl, let's just pace it 'til it's

[Hook][Verse One: Roscoe Dash]
A lot of shits changed since the last time I saw you
A lot hasn’t they prolly still wishing that I would fall through
Rappers told me if I ever need it just to call you
So here I am again to tell you everything I aught too
Monsoons, typhoons, hurricanes tsunamis
All the shows, Rolls, planes all remind me of you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you, you

[Hook]
Ever since I started its been me and you regardless
Through all the popping bottles and all the pain and hardships
Its you, you, you, you, you
Its you you, you, you…
And me
