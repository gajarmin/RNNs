Huh-huh, yo Mister D-O-Double-R

[Verse 1]
I say yeah buddy, rollin' like a big shot
Chevy tuned up like a NASCAR pitstop (Yeah)
Fresh paint job (check) fresh inside (check)
Is the outside frame and the trunk wide? (Yes)
Are the rims big? (what?) Do it ride good? (good)
Lean back, right hand on the pinewood

[Hook x2]
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Ice, ice cream, ice, ice, ice cream paint job

Got screens on the dash, watching Saved by the Bell
Got a house by the bayside (bayside)
Yeah, I'm livin' like that
And I'm ridin' like that (like that)
Boy I'm ridin' like that
And the steerin' wheel wood like a baseball bat
Just like Archie said, "We ready"
Whole clique straight lunatics like Nelly

Crank my car, she be hummin'
Rims so big, you can see me coming
Prime Time Click, we get money
Stay iced up like TV Johnny

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
I'm live (I'm live) like a Superbowl kickoff
My slab got a lot of niggas pissed off
Yeah paint shine like lip gloss
Cadillac got a wide body like Rick Ross
Took time but my cash got right
If I want it, I'mma buy it, I don't ask no price
Rearview mirror, jumbo dice
Trunk hit hard like Kimbo Slice
Be around tint, no window light
Car ride smooth so the rims alright
That right thurr, C.C. I like
Got the top notch slab for the dirt-cheap price
Press one button, car automatic start
Stand too close, car alarm might bark (Like what?)
ARGH, ARGH, like Q-Dawgs
Prime Time Click make it move like U-Haul

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
I ride with a towel cause the candy paint wet

I ride with a towel cause the candy paint wet
Rims on the ride got these niggas upset
Rims sittin' high, so I ride upset

Spendin all yo' money on these bitches, what is that about?
Nuthin! Beat ya whoopin ass, I be makin stupid cash
Get special attention like them niggas in a stupid class
Watch me, youngsters, motherfuckin monster
Pla-playin with this paper like I'm playin in a dumpster
Yo' baby mama payin all yo' bills, youse a busta
Even though she workin 9 to 5, she still a hustla
Yeah, that means she's runnin' thangs, while you out here lookin lame
Damn~! What a shame, ol' broke ass nigga!

[Hook]

[Dorrough]

[Verse 1: Dorrough]
I be on that Cali Kush
I don’t smoke that Reggie Bush
Even though I rush straight out through these willows like I’m Reggie Bush!
Cloud 9, always taking flights, I steady book
I’m head baked, left a million trying to get some Kush
I go around the world me and my local homies
I turn up like I got remote controllers on me! (Turn up!)
Got cheese and bread, all I need is pepperoni
All my bitches bad, don’t need no testimony!
Ace of spades, I’m a renegade!
I don’t call the foe, I fill my lemonade
Hawaiian, punch the Sprite up even men it made
Pour it up and drink it like it’s Gatorade

I stay high
This OG Kush got me believing I can fly
All around the world, they blow on La La La La La
Nigga, where we go, we on that
Every race I know be on that
Roll up and blow...

[Hook: Dorrough]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Break it down, roll a pound, blow it up!
I got a call from my dawg, said it’s going up!
Said if you got some KK, best believe I’m showing up!
And if the sign say no smoking, now I don’t give a fuck
This is what you call that one percent
Cause 99 of the other is fake!
Real cookies, not the ones that you bake
Smoking one and got one on the way
In my new larger estate, drives in the day like Bob Marley was wake
You understand me?

I’m always high
I’m never on the ground, I’m somewhere in the sky
Not R. Kelly but I believe that I can fly
And all my niggas screaming Taylor til we die
Blow away cause I’m on that

[Hook: Dorrough]

[Verse 3: Dorrough]
I’m on that Texas till you know what’s up (know what’s up)
That mean I got that drink up in my cup (up in my cup)
And everywhere we go we fire up (we fire up)
We stay wet and heated like a fucking fire trunk
Ha, I’m super-hot, chain full of watts
I bet I got more diamonds than your jeweler got!
You know we’re smoking loud and make you choke a lot
And every time we choke, we make you take a shot!

I stay high
This OG Kush got me believing I can fly (R. Kelly!)
All around the world, they blow on La La La La La
Nigga, where we go, we on that
Every race I know be on that
Roll up and blow I'm on that...

Paint drippin like the rain on a windshield

[Hook]
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside (REMIX! Hey!)

M-m-m-mama black, daddy black
Uncle black, granny black, catch me in a Cadillac
(Cadillac) Say, ridin on a foreign ti'
Wit some ice cream paint, got the shoes and I had to match
My car, yo we stunt like that (like that)
Down in Dallas, Texas, yeah it's crunk like that
All I gotta do is this, drop the top and show the wrist
And I can pull a bad chick off eye contact
Yeaaaaaaa - it's ya, it's ya, it's ya boy Dorrough
I got a wood grain wheel and a wood grain flo'
Paint job, fresh sprayed, pop trunk, might wave
Yeah, buddy, I'm paid, umm, everybody know
That getting money is the mission, it's the auto clone magician
0-9, but I drive a 0-12 Expedition
Wit a auto-start ignition, fo' fifteens hit it
Wit a sign on the back say "Let's go fishing"

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, West Coast nigga
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Twenty-fo' on the ol' schools sittin up high (high)
Push - I hit the gas, fuck a red light
All chrome Chevy signs on my tailpipe
I smash out Doggy Dogg live the Boss' Life
Show these niggas what it cost and how to floss it right
They hear the song and they Jerk to it all night
Euro grill, candy paint dripping off white (drip, drip, drip..)
Yeah, we got the streets turned up
Purp in my blunt, brown in my cup
Boat motor in my engine, 15s' in my trunk
Ice Creams' on my feet, I'mma fuck the streets up
(Fuck it up!) Wet paint job, shift kit, no clutch
Pocket fulla money wit some Hustle Boy Chucks
Sugar coat seats, soft white crust
They say they ridin clean, but they ain't got it like us!

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Nipsey Hu$$le]
It's 15s' in the trunk, let my beat bang (yep!)
Half of chicken on my neck, let my chain hang (yep!)
Four fifty yellow rock'll make the ass swang
Chevy tuned up, bangin Hu$$le is my last name
For the rap game, still us in the fast lane
Pulled up at the spot, parked the Regal on the grass mayne
Swisher Sweets same color as the wood grain
They say, "Why you leave it running?" I say "Cuz I'm in the hoooood, mayne~!"
Clean on the ourside, cream on the inside
Ask around, bet they tell you that I been fly
Way befo' Xzibit show, I had a Pimp Ride
And "All Money In" is the motto that we live by
Look, shit kept gettin betta fo' me
You hatin on me? It's whatever, I get cheddar, homie
I'm well-paid so the people know me
Ridin wood grain and leather only
Hussle

[Hook]

[Verse 4 - Jim Jones]
Splash - (candy bought) I'm drippy
Car so clean that the paint looks slippy (Hold on!)
Caught the swag flu so I got these niggas sick-y
Coney ice cream the way the girl started licking
(Baskin Robbins) Give her the shovel the way she diggin me
(Dig that!) Victory - (Ow!) Just the B.I.G. in me
Yeah, my game fly, I make the nasty girls get wit me
(Nasty!) And after the telly, it's all history
(Gone!) Chickens - rotisserie
We can make it snow motherfucker, better get your skis (We got it!)
Told her turn it up as I hit the speed
Push the head down, word is bond as I hit the weed
(Uh-ohhhhhh)

[Verse 5 - Soulja Boy]
Yeah shawty, Soulja Boy big dawg
Black-on-black Lamborghini, ice cream paint job
WOOOSH! Black card bank card
So much money, look like I had the bank robbed
Flow cajin, spicy punchline
Disrespect me, get jumped like the lunch line
Titanic swag like I'm standin on a boat
Man ya boy's got money, but your flow still broke
No pad, no pen I'm goin ing
Flyin down the highway, blowing on a Kush-ington
I'm gettin money like I never would believe
So many tattoos that my skin cain't breathe
I'm gettin old money but I'm a youngsta
My swag presidential, make Obama wanna sponsor me[Intro: Diddy]
This is the remix

[Intro 2: DJ Drama]
Hey Dorrough
You know you started something with this "Get Big" shit, right?

Hey, first thing first, I hit the scene solo
I rep the triple D, Dirk Nowitzki Tony Romo
I can’t be touched, oh no, I’m flashy like a photo
My car paint like the AT&T logo
Blue and white paint on a Mazarati fo’ do’
My outerwear is Gucci but my underwear is polo
You say you getting money but you baby mama say

[Verse 2: Diddy]
Who the fuck talkin’ money, ha ha ha funny
I got so much money, my money count money
My nickname is Billy, I’m a motherfucking star
My penthouse so high that my address is Mars
Bought an oil rig now my bank counts Arabian
Yacht so big, you coulda sworn I brought the navy in
This is my throne, the top, I’m alone
If you ain’t close to a billion, take yo broke ass home
Motherfucker

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
I spit dope boy knowledge, bird in my pocket
There’s too many hundreds, they can’t fit in the wallet
Rubber band up, all white down
Three hundred twenties for the whole pound
Big block gators, fresh pair of Marcs
599, brand new Ferrari
Remix, yeah nigga get it
Million dollar nigga, money be my best friend
Yo Gotti!

[Verse 4: Bun B]
I got my city on my back, my diamonds on my front
Conjure up in my cup, granddaddy in my blunt
Did it 2000 and whatever, the year is after this is
Cadillac shoes and the jazzy yellow misses
Wanna blow me kisses, right around the zipper
Down and drop it to the flo’ and I ain’t even gotta tip her
R.I.P. to Jack Tripper, two up in the crib
They say they wanna have my babies then they better get a bib
Here they come

[Verse 5: Diamond]
I came in as a rookie with my pockets on fat
Got a million dollar pussy, bitch, my cat got stacks
Uhh, n-n-n-now that a boss bitch move
If you go against the boss but the boss never loses
Got a house on the water so I can feed the gators
Rasberry Porsche, 32 flavors
My bread so swoll, I can’t fit it in my wallet
My pockets on big, Christopher Wallace

[Verse 6: Shawty Lo]
Do it shawty, let me say
Shawty Lo do it B.I.G
I like a lot of hoes and I love the freaks
But if I had to choose - M.O.E
You ain’t got enough paper
Middle finger to a hater
You remember me? Big Uf
Purp in mine, what’s in yo cup?

[Hook]

[Verse 7: Wiz Khalifa]
I post up, time to roll up
Give the hoes what they need, give the people what they want
Uhh, I don’t fuck with no blunts

Wizzle man, rollin’ out the big bag
With a bad bitch, light brown skin thick ass
Never slow, I get mine quick fast
Gettin’ money in this bitch ass

[Verse 8: Maino]
Standin’ on the couch in club with a pocket full of c-notes
Niggas can’t tell me I ain’t bigger then Nino
Hop up in the Coupe, give it gas I’m floatin’
Money getting’ big like the arms on Hulk Hogan
Stacks on top of stacks, baby this is IHOP
I be runnin’ down on sacks, auto I shop
Everything is big, big chain keep a big chrome
Big house big truck, big body red bone

[Hook]

Now I'm drunk, got lil' mama crunk, tell 'er

Spendin all yo' money on these bitches, what is that about?
Nuthin! Beat ya whoopin ass, I be makin stupid cash
Get special attention like them niggas in a stupid class
Watch me, youngsters, motherfuckin monster
Pla-playin with this paper like I'm playin in a dumpster
Yo' baby mama payin all yo' bills, youse a busta
Even though she workin 9 to 5, she still a hustla
Yeah, that means she's runnin' thangs, while you out here lookin lame
Damn~! What a shame, ol' broke ass nigga!

[Hook]

[Intro 2: DJ Drama]
Hey Dorrough
You know you started something with this "Get Big" shit, right?

Catch up suckas!

[Verse 1: Dorrough]
Hey, first thing first, I hit the scene solo
I rep the triple D, Dirk Nowitzki Tony Romo
I can’t be touched, oh no, I’m flashy like a photo
My car paint like the AT&T logo
Blue and white paint on a Mazarati fo’ do’
My outerwear is Gucci but my underwear is polo
You say you getting money but you baby mama say
You got a dollar in yo pocket, say my nigga youse a hobo

[Hook: Dorrough]
You ain’t got enough money [x2]
Get big [x4]

[Bridge: Diddy (over Hook)]

C’mon check this out - go!

[Verse 2: Diddy]
Who the fuck talkin’ money, ha ha ha funny
I got so much money, my money count money
My nickname is Billy, I’m a motherfucking star
My penthouse so high that my address is Mars
Bought an oil rig now my bank counts Arabian
Yacht so big, you coulda sworn I brought the navy in
This is my throne, the top, I’m alone
If you ain’t close to a billion, take yo broke ass home
Motherfucker

[Hook]

[Bridge: Diddy (over Hook)]
Take yo broke ass home man
This is big money talk right here
This is the remix
I see you Dorrough, c’mon

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
I spit dope boy knowledge, bird in my pocket
There’s too many hundreds, they can’t fit in the wallet
Rubber band up, all white down
Three hundred twenties for the whole pound
Big block gators, fresh pair of Marcs
599, brand new Ferrari
Remix, yeah nigga get it
Million dollar nigga, money be my best friend
Yo Gotti!

[Verse 4: Bun B]
I got my city on my back, my diamonds on my front
Conjure up in my cup, granddaddy in my blunt
Did it 2000 and whatever, the year is after this is
Cadillac shoes and the jazzy yellow misses
Wanna blow me kisses, right around the zipper
Down and drop it to the flo’ and I ain’t even gotta tip her
R.I.P. to Jack Tripper, two up in the crib
They say they wanna have my babies then they better get a bib
Here they come

[Verse 5: Diamond]
I came in as a rookie with my pockets on fat
Got a million dollar pussy, bitch, my cat got stacks
Uhh, n-n-n-now that a boss bitch move
If you go against the boss but the boss never loses
Got a house on the water so I can feed the gators
Rasberry Porsche, 32 flavors
My bread so swoll, I can’t fit it in my wallet
My pockets on big, Christopher Wallace

[Verse 6: Shawty Lo]
Do it shawty, let me say
Shawty Lo do it B.I.G
I like a lot of hoes and I love the freaks
But if I had to choose - M.O.E
You ain’t got enough paper
Middle finger to a hater
You remember me? Big Uf
Purp in mine, what’s in yo cup?

[Hook]

[Verse 7: Wiz Khalifa]
I post up, time to roll up
Give the hoes what they need, give the people what they want
Uhh, I don’t fuck with no blunts
You know how it go homie, no zig zag, no drig drag
Wizzle man, rollin’ out the big bag
With a bad bitch, light brown skin thick ass
Never slow, I get mine quick fast
Gettin’ money in this bitch ass

[Verse 8: Maino]
Standin’ on the couch in club with a pocket full of c-notes
Niggas can’t tell me I ain’t bigger then Nino
Hop up in the Coupe, give it gas I’m floatin’
Money getting’ big like the arms on Hulk Hogan
Stacks on top of stacks, baby this is IHOP
I be runnin’ down on sacks, auto I shop
Everything is big, big chain keep a big chrome
Big house big truck, big body red bone

[Hook]

[Outro: DJ Drama]

Are the rims big? (what?) Do it ride good? (good)
Lean back, right hand on the pinewood

And the steerin' wheel wood like a baseball bat
Just like Archie said, "We ready"
Whole clique straight lunatics like Nelly

Rims so big, you can see me coming
Prime Time Click, we get money
Stay iced up like TV Johnny

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
I'm live (I'm live) like a Superbowl kickoff
My slab got a lot of niggas pissed off
Yeah paint shine like lip gloss
Cadillac got a wide body like Rick Ross
Took time but my cash got right
If I want it, I'mma buy it, I don't ask no price
Rearview mirror, jumbo dice
Trunk hit hard like Kimbo Slice
Be around tint, no window light
Car ride smooth so the rims alright
That right thurr, C.C. I like
Got the top notch slab for the dirt-cheap price
Press one button, car automatic start
Stand too close, car alarm might bark (Like what?)
ARGH, ARGH, like Q-Dawgs
Prime Time Click make it move like U-Haul

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
I ride with a towel cause the candy paint wet
Rims on the ride got these niggas upset
Rims sittin' high, so I ride upset

I ride with a towel cause the candy paint wet
Rims on the ride got these niggas upset

[Hook][Intro: Dorrough] {Snoop}
Hah! {West Coast, baby..}
Yeah, remix! This time I say
Yeah, buddy - live good, eat good
Old school Chevy to a Cadillac Fleetwood
Got the inside - (black!), and the outside (black!)
Thinkin 'bout a Maserati, but I rather ride ('Lac)
A.C. blow (whaaat?!), like wind chill (chill!)
Paint drippin like the rain on a windshield

[Hook]
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside (REMIX! Hey!)
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside (REMIX! Hey!)

[Verse 1 - Dorrough]
M-m-m-mama black, daddy black
Uncle black, granny black, catch me in a Cadillac
(Cadillac) Say, ridin on a foreign ti'
Wit some ice cream paint, got the shoes and I had to match
My car, yo we stunt like that (like that)
Down in Dallas, Texas, yeah it's crunk like that
All I gotta do is this, drop the top and show the wrist
And I can pull a bad chick off eye contact
Yeaaaaaaa - it's ya, it's ya, it's ya boy Dorrough
I got a wood grain wheel and a wood grain flo'
Paint job, fresh sprayed, pop trunk, might wave
Yeah, buddy, I'm paid, umm, everybody know
That getting money is the mission, it's the auto clone magician
0-9, but I drive a 0-12 Expedition
Wit a auto-start ignition, fo' fifteens hit it
Wit a sign on the back say "Let's go fishing"

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, West Coast nigga
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Twenty-fo' on the ol' schools sittin up high (high)
Push - I hit the gas, fuck a red light
All chrome Chevy signs on my tailpipe
I smash out Doggy Dogg live the Boss' Life
Show these niggas what it cost and how to floss it right
They hear the song and they Jerk to it all night
Euro grill, candy paint dripping off white (drip, drip, drip..)
Yeah, we got the streets turned up
Purp in my blunt, brown in my cup
Boat motor in my engine, 15s' in my trunk
Ice Creams' on my feet, I'mma fuck the streets up
(Fuck it up!) Wet paint job, shift kit, no clutch
Pocket fulla money wit some Hustle Boy Chucks
Sugar coat seats, soft white crust
They say they ridin clean, but they ain't got it like us!

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Nipsey Hu$$le]
It's 15s' in the trunk, let my beat bang (yep!)
Half of chicken on my neck, let my chain hang (yep!)
Four fifty yellow rock'll make the ass swang
Chevy tuned up, bangin Hu$$le is my last name
For the rap game, still us in the fast lane
Pulled up at the spot, parked the Regal on the grass mayne
Swisher Sweets same color as the wood grain
They say, "Why you leave it running?" I say "Cuz I'm in the hoooood, mayne~!"
Clean on the ourside, cream on the inside
Ask around, bet they tell you that I been fly
Way befo' Xzibit show, I had a Pimp Ride
And "All Money In" is the motto that we live by
Look, shit kept gettin betta fo' me
You hatin on me? It's whatever, I get cheddar, homie
I'm well-paid so the people know me
Ridin wood grain and leather only
Hussle

[Hook]

[Verse 4 - Jim Jones]
Splash - (candy bought) I'm drippy
Car so clean that the paint looks slippy (Hold on!)
Caught the swag flu so I got these niggas sick-y
Coney ice cream the way the girl started licking
(Baskin Robbins) Give her the shovel the way she diggin me
(Dig that!) Victory - (Ow!) Just the B.I.G. in me
Yeah, my game fly, I make the nasty girls get wit me
(Nasty!) And after the telly, it's all history
(Gone!) Chickens - rotisserie
We can make it snow motherfucker, better get your skis (We got it!)
Told her turn it up as I hit the speed
Push the head down, word is bond as I hit the weed
(Uh-ohhhhhh)

[Verse 5 - Soulja Boy]
Yeah shawty, Soulja Boy big dawg
Black-on-black Lamborghini, ice cream paint job
WOOOSH! Black card bank card
So much money, look like I had the bank robbed
Flow cajin, spicy punchline
Disrespect me, get jumped like the lunch line
Titanic swag like I'm standin on a boat
Man ya boy's got money, but your flow still broke
No pad, no pen I'm goin ing
Flyin down the highway, blowing on a Kush-ington
I'm gettin money like I never would believe
So many tattoos that my skin cain't breathe
I'm gettin old money but I'm a youngsta

[Verse 1: Dorrough]
I be on that Cali Kush
I don’t smoke that Reggie Bush
Even though I rush straight out through these willows like I’m Reggie Bush!
Cloud 9, always taking flights, I steady book
I’m head baked, left a million trying to get some Kush
I go around the world me and my local homies
I turn up like I got remote controllers on me! (Turn up!)
Got cheese and bread, all I need is pepperoni
All my bitches bad, don’t need no testimony!
Ace of spades, I’m a renegade!
I don’t call the foe, I fill my lemonade
Hawaiian, punch the Sprite up even men it made
Pour it up and drink it like it’s Gatorade

I stay high
This OG Kush got me believing I can fly
All around the world, they blow on La La La La La
Nigga, where we go, we on that
Every race I know be on that
Roll up and blow...

[Hook: Dorrough]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Break it down, roll a pound, blow it up!
I got a call from my dawg, said it’s going up!
Said if you got some KK, best believe I’m showing up!
And if the sign say no smoking, now I don’t give a fuck
This is what you call that one percent
Cause 99 of the other is fake!
Real cookies, not the ones that you bake
Smoking one and got one on the way
In my new larger estate, drives in the day like Bob Marley was wake
You understand me?

I’m always high
I’m never on the ground, I’m somewhere in the sky
Not R. Kelly but I believe that I can fly
And all my niggas screaming Taylor til we die
Blow away cause I’m on that

[Hook: Dorrough]

[Verse 3: Dorrough]
I’m on that Texas till you know what’s up (know what’s up)
That mean I got that drink up in my cup (up in my cup)
And everywhere we go we fire up (we fire up)
We stay wet and heated like a fucking fire trunk
Ha, I’m super-hot, chain full of watts
I bet I got more diamonds than your jeweler got!
You know we’re smoking loud and make you choke a lot
And every time we choke, we make you take a shot!

I stay high
This OG Kush got me believing I can fly (R. Kelly!)
All around the world, they blow on La La La La La
Nigga, where we go, we on that
Every race I know be on that
Roll up and blow I'm on that...

[Verse Six: Jay Rock]
Who followed me home?! Drop it like Angola stones
Poppin my disc is like poppin ya dome
With the K/Kay, +Slay+ rappers in the circumference of the own home
It's my world, see my face in the ozone? (Whoo!)
Before I was on the cover of magazines
I was loadin up, duckin for cover with magazines
Clips like a hairdresser, getcha doobie clean
Welcome to Hell mister, I own niggas and cheese

[Hook: 50 Cent Sample]
Somebody 'gon get layed the fuck out
Some-some-some-somebody 'gon get laid the fuck out
Some-some-some-somebody 'gon get laid the fuck out

She drop it, so low
One deep, so low

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
On the highway, riding with like thirty K
Youngin' dipped down in the back seat plotting with the Russian K
Pulling this car over, like throwing your life away
Catch you with your top down, then you know it's J.F.K
Clay County nigga, I'm like the mayor
Disrespect them bloodhound's they'll motherfucking spray you
Simon Say her, gon' check his mama
Take them bands, we'll get your little brother and your partner
In the club, we the shit
Ask your girl, she sucked my dick
Flexing like a bitch, I don't do no guest list
Damn these molly's got me rolling like a bitch
Turn the lights down, pour me up
Came to the club just to party and turn up
Drank till I throw up, through your fucking hood up
I just wanna see little mama drop it to the floor and shake that ass

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Dorrough]
I'm balling fast pace, like a fast break
Them niggas hating just cause they in last place
Little mama drop it low and make that ass shake
Make a nigga wonder if it's real or if that ass fake
I fin' it up and throw it from the Gucci bag
Ain't scared to throw it up cause I'll recoup it back
Money making zero's, I call it stupid cash
I want a smart girl, that got a stupid ass
I throw my money high, make her get low
I like them skinny girls, but I want a thick ho
She drop it so low, one deep, so low
And hit this pit cause she do it on my dick bro

[Waka Flocka Flame]
Turn the lights down, pour me up
Came to the club just to party and turn up
Drank till I throw up, throw your fucking hood up
I just wanna see little mama drop it to the floor and shake that ass

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Shawty Lo]
411, she say she need my info
But I informed her, I'm looking for a nympho
Get low, L.O., beat her, D-Bo
Uno, dos, quatro, cinco
Yeah, I'm looking for a slight model
Bad bitch with a body like a Coke bottle
Aye, fat ass like Lola, guess a little water, guess a little soda
Turn the lights down, turn me up
I was asleep, they woke me up
But hold up, I do it for the d-boys
Waka, got the party like the white boys

[Waka Flocka Flame]
Turn the lights down, pour me up
Came to the club just to party and turn up
Drank till I throw up, throw your fucking hood up
I just wanna see little mama drop it to the floor and shake that ass

[Hook][Intro - Chamillionaire - talking]
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
I brought my DJ with me, that mean we goin in
I brought my DJ with me, that mean we goin in

[Hook 1 - Chamillionaire]
I'm the main event, whoa
I'm the main event, whoa
Still grindin in the streets like I ain't made a cent

I'm the main event, whoa
I'm the main event, whoa
Tryin to get it like the money that I made was spent

I'm the main event, whoa
I'm the main event, whoa
Still hustlin like I know it's time to pay the rent

I'm the main event, whoa
I'm the main event, whoa
You're lookin for me, you could find me where the money at

[Verse 1 - Chamillionaire]
The walk in after party, Texas I'm what it is
Exit the bar if you ain't tryin to get your card slid
They ain't no big dogs, they just bark big
But I ain't never seen the damage that a bark did
It's the Chamillionaire, I only trust Ben
I brought some ladies with me, that mean I'm plus ten
I brought my DJ with me, that mean we goin in
I do it big like my jimmy wasn't tucked in
Nuts large, lucky I don't keep my dick exposed
See they the past, I'm the present like some Christmas clothes
Reppin Texas so don't question if I'm tippin fours
The wheels fly, every vehicle is pigeon-toed
Look at the evidence, looks like it's evident
She wanna bone, she look at me like a skeleton
See this the realest that your radio has ever been
I'm in my element, somebody better tell her man

[Hook 2 - Chamillionaire]
I'm the main event, whoa
I'm the main event, whoa
Still grindin in the streets like I ain't made a cent

I'm the main event, I'm the main event
Uh oh, uh oh

[Verse 2 - Paul Wall]
I swear it ain't been the same ever since I got cake
My hustle is high rate, so haters are irate
Every dollar I can make, I'm a get it 'til the day of my wake
I'm on a paper chase for pies, yeah that cookies and cake
And hold it down for my state, talkin down's a mistake
Ride with me or collide with me, you can't change fate
Southside Houston, Texas, where I roam in the streets
And Northside where I sleep (the Northside don't sleep)
If you sleepin on Texas, better wake up quick
Stop bitin our style and get off our dick
All the jealousy need to quit and the hatin should stop
Cause the third coast ain't never gonna flop, I think not partner

[Hook 1]

[Slim Thug talking over the end of the Hook]
I know you don't cuss but I do Cham, ha, ha

[Verse 3 - Slim Thug]
When Thug Boss come out, lights out, show's over
It's "All Eyez On Me" like 'Pac told ya
If you love ya bitch, you better go and cuff her
Cause tonight if I want to, I'm a fuck her
I'm in this bitch, half a mill' worth of jewelry on
Rocks' so big, lookin like a Flinstone (yeah)
'Fit fresher than some Sunday morning breakfast
We gotta do it big, cause bitch we from Texas
Foreign cars, get your foreign hoes on your team
And I don't drink and drive, I just drink and lean
Keep a bank roll longer than a limousine
Boppers beggin me to hit it like a dope fiend
I run the H like it's a motherfuckin marathon
About to break a take, damn Cham, that's the one
I'm in the elevator, top spot, here I come
Rap Barry Bonds, I got the most home runs

[Verse 4 - Dorrough]
Say what? I made 'em change the prin, they thought I came and
Went
But like the Grand Finale nigga, I'm the main event
Still grindin in the streets like I ain't made a cent
Ballin, the commentators say I'm what the game presents
I'm Mister Get It Done, I do it to the T
If you don't know the name, just call me number 23
I keep a quart load of Spring Bling bikini hoes
Yeah it's a 'lac but it's equipped with Lamborghini doors
My engine souped up, I'm in a super ride
Yeah I'm from Texas nigga, everything's supersized
I never rode a horse, never saw a tumbleweed
But I get high of course, I done smoked a ton of weed
Man and my money hard to fold up
Yeah, I'm holdin Texas down but I rep the whole South
Get your tickets early, shows stay sold out
"Dorrough Music", my album off in stores now

[Hook 2X]Ha, yuh, Dorrough music
North side, South side, East Coast
West Coast, Midwest
From my city to yo city
(Dallas, Texas)

From yo hood to my hood
(Say)
Right now, I present to the world
Tomeka Pearl

Put one hand, cross my heart
Want nothing see me apart
From my home where I start
I'm too smart and all I know is

You can take me from my hood
But you can't take my hood from me
I rep my hood, it's understood
Say what 'chu want but all I know is

Say, it's a funny day in the hood
And everybody and they momma out
I must admit today, I'm kinda feeling good
Ain't nobody beefing
And none of my niggas out up in the feds

So the laws ain't gotta be said
Cause it's understood
And you know the game
It ain't nobody showing love
Unless you gotta name

And don't nobody turn they head
Unless you hoggin' lanes
Ain't nobody breaking bread
Unless you do the same
You know the game boy

Either you ride on heavy Chevy's or gliding
On the Pirellis and sliding
Pulling women to trying
Best believe that we grinding
Getting it where I stay

We getting it every way and safe
Before the end of the day
All the ballers ballin', all the jockers jocking
All the hater's hating, all the boppers bopping
Old lady cool, probably take her shopping
Real G's let me hear it if you feel me knocking

You can take me from my hood
But you can't take my hood from me
I rep my hood it's understood
Say what 'chu want but all I know is

Check me out, I'm holding
Steady like I'm rolling
Riding through yo hood
I chunk the deuce up like I'm posing

Riding through yo city
Rolling gutta like I'm bowling
First I get it live then shut it down
Like it's closing

Early, long wide worly
Kicking one deep cause you boys act girly
Or maybe with a sweet big ice cream swirly
Wrist gold neck, gold teeth, white pearly

And you can catch me
Like fish fries on a Saturday
Ya momma looking good
I like the way she work her hunny day

She hopped up in the slab
I say, "What 'cha wanna do today?"
She looked at me and smiled then said
"Boy, I'm doing you today"

Fo' real, I guess that mean
That I'm official now, it took awhile
But now they recognize
I'm on a mission now

Stop, listen I got that full attention now
Since I got attention
It's the perfect time to mission out that

Put one hand, cross my heart
Want nothing see me apart
From my home where I start
I'm too smart and all I know is

You can take me from my hood
But you can't take my hood from me
I rep my hood it's understood
Say what 'chu want but all I know is

It don't really matter much where I be
Never will you find another G like me
You see a lot of people try to be like me
But never will you find another G like me

Man, I'm repping my hood for a long, long time
Never will you find another hood like mine
I hope that people got it understood like mine
Cause never will you find another hood like mine

Put one hand, cross my heart
Want nothing see me apart
From my home where I start
I'm too smart and all I know is

You can take me from my hood
But you can't take my hood from me
I rep my hood it's understood
Say what 'chu want but all I know isI don't care what they say
I live my life day by day
Like everything is ok
Guess that's the reason I pray
Light up and blow on this haze
Oh dirty take me away
Up there where I wanna stay
So I can be M-I-A

I say 24 hours 7 days a week
Been grindin so long I can do it in my sleep
You reap what you sew you sew what you reap
And when you get somethin good you hold and you keep it
Cuz when you got somethin somebody else won't it
Shinin on a hater feel real good don't it
Ridin on a hater sound real hood don't it
Before I take a L I'll kill my opponent
Last time hard this time go harder
Some do it big but the kids do it larger
Down town in the house by the water
Texas, Georgia, south beach Florida
Yea I do everything drastic
And I don't settle for nothin but fantastic
Pop pop on an X Y axis
Me and my click say lit like matches

I don't care what they say
I live my life day by day
Like everything is ok
Guess that's the reason I pray
Light up and blow on this haze
Oh dirty take me away
Up there where I wanna stay
So I can be M-I-A

Sunny and I ain't talkin bout Miami
Last year was good but this year I won a Grammy
Album in the streets but id rather much be
M-I-A just me and my family
Work all day double time all night
Show my baby girl that errthang alright
Live like a pimp that's our hype
Gotta thick chick 5'9 all tight
Gotta rent chick yeah I like all type
But my down there chick where tha bud all straight
I betchu think I'm just talkin
See her for ya self dime piece walkin
Speakin of walkin you can walk without crawlin first

You can't stand without fallin down and
When you down on the ground stand
Back up on the mound
And then swang harder

I don't care what they say
I live my life day by day
Like everything is ok
Guess that's the reason I pray
Light up and blow on this haze
Oh dirty take me away
Up there where I wanna stay
So I can be M-I-A

Yall and this is still good music
The world know I make real good music
Ain't got to but I'm still gonna prove it
Haters hate me but they still be groovin
Dont nobody know how long it took me to shine
Don't know body know how long it took me to grind
Sometimes dreams get lost by time
One night damn near lost my mind
Good things happen if you believe it
If you perceive it
You achieve it
This is motivation some of yall needed
Tryna help you see
So eliminate the negative
Insinuate the positive
Work none stop gettin money my prerogative
An yea I try to be cooperative
But when I keep it real some take it as derogative

I don't care what they say
I live my life day by day
Like everything is ok
Guess that's the reason I pray
Light up and blow on this haze
Oh dirty take me away
Up there where I wanna stay
So I can be M-I-A

Aaaaaaa so I can be M-I-A aaaaaaa

-CHORUS-Hello

This time you was wrong, I ain't had no bitch
No trick, no ho all over my dick
This time you was wrong, you say you got evidence
Fuck that girl, you know you ain't really got shit
This time you was wrong

I know them other times you caught a nigga cheatin' red handed
Yeah girl, I admit it, this time you was wrong
Make a nigga wanna holla, oh Lord
I ain't never met a bitch that tried to swallow so hard

As soon a nigga fall asleep you all in a nigga phone
I swear you can't wait to catch a nigga doin' wrong
You lookin' under rocks tryna find a dirty stone
Before you catch me in the A you prolly see me up and gone

And girl, I ain't tryna leave me and you alone
But girl, I'm sick and tired of all this petty shit you on
So before you fuck it up you better listen to this song
Cause when I choose to up and leave you gon' swear I did you wrong

Yeah, I did a lot of dirt back then I admit
But don't forget you did a lot a shit a nigga won't forget
Cause I'm tired of the fightin', the drama, the shit
Should I leave? Should I peel like a banana and split?

And girl I'ma warn you one time, this the last time
Next time I'ma be lame, na, na, na, na
Make a nigga wanna holla, oh Lord
I ain't never met a bitch that tried to swallow so hard

This time you was wrong, I ain't had no bitch
No trick, no ho all over my dick
This time you was wrong, you say you got evidence
Fuck that girl, you know you ain't really got shit
This time you was wrong

I know them other times you caught a nigga cheatin' red handed
Yeah girl, I admit it, this time you was wrong
Make a nigga wanna holla, oh Lord
I ain't never met a bitch that tried to swallow so hard

Girl, witchu it's never endin', everyday is like a game
Don't matter how we do it everyday I'm in the same
All that Internet bullshit drivin' me insane
You tell your son, thanks for grinnin', its gon' leave you in the rain

And girl, I ain't sayin' I'm caught up in the fame
But you gotta understand that you ain't fuckin' with a lame
So when these bitches flip down and try to sabotage my name
You shouldn't leave and get to trippin', you should recognize the game

Cause you know these hoes choosin' and I know these hoes fake
But see you listen to your friends and that right there be there your mistake
Plus I'm tired of all the stressin', very little I can take
Can I live? Can I breathe? Should I leave? Should I stay?

And girl I'ma warn you one time, this the last time
Next time I'ma be lame, na, na, na, na
Make a nigga wanna holla, oh Lord
I ain't never met a bitch that tried to swallow so hard

This time you was wrong, I ain't had no bitch
No trick, no ho all over my dick
This time you was wrong, you say you got evidence
Fuck that girl, you know you ain't really got shit
This time you was wrong

I know them other times you caught a nigga cheatin' red handed
Yeah girl, I admit it, this time you was wrong
Make a nigga wanna holla, oh Lord
I ain't never met a bitch that tried to swallow so hard

You had me with a throw the towel in, give it up
Cause you ain't gonna be satisfied 'til I go
You make me wanna take away my love
Kiss your ass goodbye now girl, but I ain't tryna put on now show

You make me wanna walk right out that door
You make me wanna walk right out that door
You make me wanna pack my shit
And when I pack my shit girl, I ain't comin' back no more

Yeah, you best believe that
Girl, you causin' me to stress
One thing that I suggest, I think you should invest
Yeah, you best believe that

The main problem to address
You don't know what you possess
And that's why we don't progress
And you best believe that

I'ma take my time 'til I make my mind
Should I stay? Should I go? Na, na, na, na
You make a nigga wanna holla, oh Lord
I ain't never met a bitch that tried to swallow so hard

This time you was wrong, I ain't had no bitch
No trick, no ho all over my dick
This time you was wrong, you say you got evidence
Fuck that girl, you know you ain't really got shit
This time you was wrong

I know them other times you caught a nigga cheatin' red handed
Yeah girl, I admit it, this time you was wrong

Style so hood, I wanna see what she about

She walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that walk, walk that walk

Goddamn, she a sassy
Face, body, ass, yeah, she got the total package
Walking through the club like a nigga ain't watchin'
Struttin' that strut like she in a mall shoppin'

Can't forget the mention, yeah, she got the mansions
I wonder if she know that she the center of attention
Middle of the floor, doing her, looking sexy
She can walk that walk, like the niggas do at weddings

She the type you wanna marry, top notch and classy
Niggas lined up trying to be her baby daddy
Excuse me, what's your name? How you doing? I'm just askin'
Can I take you by the hand? Baby, I'll be gladly

Damn, I want her bad, so I'mma come at her politely
By the way she flirtin', I can tell it that she like me
Way across the floor, but looking at me while she dancing
That sexy ass can be, lil' mama, you ain't understandin'

She look good in her clothes, head to her toes
Primetime chick, she the type to get chose
Baby girl so fine, she make a nigga wanna shout
Style so hood, I wanna see what she about

She walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that walk, walk that walk

She got Beyonce hips, Keishya Cole thighs
Meagan Good lips and some sexy-ass eyes
She yellow like the road in the Wizard of the Oz
Got them other bitches hatin', talkin' like Plies

Say it then she go fed
Then she taste up from her toes to her head
Take her out to eat before I take her to the bed
And give her that uhh, uhh and I don't need no meds

All I need is her, thirty minutes and a rubber
Nigga like me, you'll find none other
Straight beast mode, three times, one hour
Give it to her, in the kitchen, bedroom or the shower

Lil' talk, I got what she need
Head board knockin' up against her knees
Hit her from the back so I can grab her by the waist
Flip her over then you all on her face

She look good in her clothes, head to her toes
Primetime chick, she the type to get chose
Baby girl so fine, she make a nigga wanna shout
Style so hood, I wanna see what she about

She walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that walk, walk that walk

She can walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that, walk that, walk that walk
Walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that, walk that, walk that walk

Walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that, walk that, walk that walk
Walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that, walk that, walk that walk
