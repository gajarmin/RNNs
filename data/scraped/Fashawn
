C-O-P-Y-C-A-T
C-O-P-Y-C-A-T

[Verse 1: Fashawn]
Uh
Your flow far from authentic
Mm - you're all gimmicks
Seen too many small niggas get large
Augmented
I increase and inflict scars on all nemeses
With these thoughts I'm scribbling
Shawn the mortician it is
Critical you're style's original
Nah, folk wouldn't make it to wax - you digital
Cats bite you like the shit's allowed
I send 'em down, show 'em how to rip a crowd
And then grip a crown
King
With this hip-hop thing
You had a fling
Me? I'm like holy matrimonies and wedding rings
Married to the craft
Your catalogue I bury in a flash
Remind me of Jim Carrey in The Mask
Perpetrating and pretending to rap
That ain't being innovative, that's identity theft, nigga
Get your own
I'm sort of like Oprah
Dropping meteors on those who mediocre

[Hook]
C-O-P-Y-C-A-T, why are you living a lie?
Everybody wanna be somebody else
When you're doing you, you don't need nobody's help
Don't be a
C-O-P-Y-C-A-T, why are you living a lie?
Everybody wanna be somebody else
When you're doing you, you don't need nobody's help
Don't be a copycat
No, don't be a copycat
Nah, don't be a *cat noise*
Don't be a copycat

[Verse 2: Fashawn]
If I wasn't the letter F
I would probably be 20syl
20 years later I'd be dropping bombs still
You honestly should pay homage and chill
Or get grilled
Like a omelette trying to climb in my field
You need to enhance your IQ
To do what I do
Purchase a passport and fly where I flew
Have some self-respect
Get some self-esteem
Imagine
Dream what nobody else could dream
Impostors
Won't get a slot on my roster
Reminder: You're not him and you're not her
But that portrayal might just get you an Oscar
Tell me: are you a minister, or are you a mobster?
One minute you Muslim and the next you a Rasta
One second you're Weezy and the next you're Big Poppa
Nah, don't even think of dropping a tape
These cats don't cultivate, they just copy and paste
It's like that

[Intro: Fashawn]
West up nigga

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
Turn the volume up and bang it out the trunk now (x8)

[Verse 1: Fashawn]
Say, who got a problem with the volume?
If you tryna sleep, go get a valium
We night owls, young, livin' our life wild
Tomorrow ain't promised, we living for right now
Pop the pussy for a real nigga right now
I ain't tryna politic and bail with you right now
Chicks looking at me like a meal ticket
Mass Appeal keep the wheels spinnin'
Deal with it, Fashawn, complements of the don
Louis Vuitton, Louboutin, fabrics I been on
Never mind that
Get your mind right before I recline that
It's beyond rap and that's the reason I'm on your block right now
Not in a physical, I invaded through sound
Yes I'm internationally known
But CA's the state that I call home
I'm about to turn it up now

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Fashawn]
This one is for the trunk
Wake up the neighborhood when the dump
Rather it's Rob Base or EZ Rock he pump
Like my old Reeboks, if he pop, I pump
Meaning I rock nothing and no one can stop me, none
What I do stop or stump, why not, I'm young
Prolly seen more Versace than Pac and Pun
Word to Migos, I move words by the kilos
I used to moved birds with my amigos
High supply my wealth
No iPhone app, I apply it myself
Your album got shelved, I couldn't keep mines on the shelf
He getting signed by God, that's half the reason I'm on your block right now
Not in a physical, I invaded through sound
Yes I'm internationally known
But Fresno's the city that I call home
I'm about to turn it up now

[Hook]

[Outro: Fashawn]
Wassup, get your weight up
It's Choppo, 2014 to infinity
Young F
Young Fresh[Produced by J. Cole]

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
It’s ya nigga, deep thinker, big drinker
Late night, with ya wife in ya crib sneaker
When you out of town, and you not around
Turn your ass over like a nigga stepped out of bounds
Crowd around young’n
I got ammo and a lot of rounds coming
Up in the streets where you not allowed, runnin’
Got the songs bitches ride around hummin’
And the niggas stay thumpin’
And the hater’s hate pumpin’
Got the 808′s bumpin’
So the trunks stay thumpin’
And the nigga get high only on occasion and
My mind too wild
Damn thought weed supposed to calm you down
But I’m so high I could palm two clouds
Boy look, these niggas quote my lines like the Lord’s book
You niggas less rhymes more hooks
More bucks but less love
You hear them drums, Questlove
No Roots, I’m so truth
I used to rock sidelines like a coach suit
Had to look at all them loafers, yeah them boat shoes
Now I’m in the game but I won't boast to you dummy
Remember niggas had short jokes for my money
Toast to the honeys, money and the liquor
And bitch I don’t sound like any other nigga
With my finger on the trigger
I burn rappers like Henny on the liver
Grant death wishes like a genie I’m a killer
Lord giveth and he taketh like an Indian giver
Hard to keep jimmy in zipper
When you got them bad Aunt Vivians with ya
Remy and weed, I got em on Pluto
I prefer Henny but the hoes like Nuvo

[Verse 2: Fashawn]
Check, every time a nigga roll
Old school whips and it’s sitting on vogues
Hoes on me when I enter the door
If a nigga wanna trip, good grip on the chrome
Empty out a clip from the fifth then I’m gone
Twist up a spliff, get a fifth of Patron
Hate a chick who just talk shit on the phone
Baby I’m tryna stick, give ya dicks to ya dome, shit
If I was you nigga I would hate him
Hot August nights I’m out there in Vegas
Stuntin' til time, had that patience
Now it’s big faces, fly vacations
Alias Shawn Stacks
Miss shows, never call back
Blowin’ Dro sippin' tall cats
On the low had to crawl back
Niggas wonder if it’s all raps
Or it’s all facts

[Verse 3: Omen]
As I step in the door like Fe fi foe
With the heat like flow and the beat typo
Better rewrite yo, get your rhyming straight
Get murked plus 8 like Jon and Kate
I mean it’s time for the face off
Hit the corner like an 8 ball
Man I concentrate like Adolf
No time for a hater, get a day job
Me on the mind you ain't even on the radar
Love her brain but I never been a fiend for her silly ways
So I’m tryna get the cream til I’m silly paid
Couldn’t put her on the team, every week another reason
To scheme like Billy Mays
Gotta grind gotta focus
Gotta shine through the minds of the blind, lot of hopeless
Never confined to the rhymes that I’ve chosen
Omen, a sign of the times, gotta quote this[Produced by DJ Khalil]

[Verse 1: Fashawn]
Guess I'm at a crossroads, lost hope and I lost quotes
My heart smokes for the fire that ya'll done provoked
For the disbelievers guess the game was missing the leader
Now they kissin' my sneakers, lipstick on my Adidas
Word to the reverend, I'm runnin' this shit like Russell
Simmons, the game is the scrimmage, I'm just strechin' my muscles
These blasphemous bastards done acid
Hazardous, had to just smash on they ass
With this classic shit, Fash
Gave 'em the biz
Ya ain't even gotta ask if he do it till the casket dip
Believe it or not, legacy mean a lot
Fiendin' to reach for the top, ya'll dreamin' that I drop
Down, high break, free from they Glocks
Make prisoners out in Rikers Island think outside the box
This couldn't have been predicted by the Mayans
Wrestlin' with religion and science

[Hook: Aloe Blacc]
Give me somethin', somethin' to believe in
Cause I'm lookin' for somethin', somethin' to believe in

[Verse 2: Nas]
Money getter until I'm a one percenter
Business is warfare, fuck you niggas
Edgar Hoover said stop the rise of a black messiah
The judge said charge teens as adults, turn them to lifers
Us holy brush waves slowly, tusk of ivory beside me
Thus no slave told me, don't try me
We enterin' the age of Aquarius
Where Ukrainian armies and US National Guard tensions flarin' up
So unforgivin' the universe when you don't listen
It's all written, that soul quenchin' gold you're missin'
Careful an ending in the destructive penal system
Where you're wild bark and your growls turn to meows and hissin'
I'm torn between religions my necklaces represent
Many centuries of theories we all respect
But bare in mind, I'm just tryna see and hear the signs
At the terrible mind, lion screams, got my stripes with a nine
They from front street, make believe block
Got an attitude avenue, liars lane
Your life ain't compatible, not to mine, you insane
You belong in the liar society
You not as fly as me
The only music head that never slept with Superhead
Although I heard she suck like state troopers and feds
Is off the hook tonight
If I don't bag Halle, I take a look alike
Last night we left the club with bottles, my future bright

[Hook]

[Bridge: Aloe Blacc]
Born in the Mississippi summer
White cotton, gold corn, black hunger
What a brother gotta do to earn a meal?
Emancipation proclaimed, still turnin' the field

[Hook][Intro: (Fashawn)]
And the world still spins going round and round
You just gotta make it until the lost is found
(Hit me
Matter of fact)
And the, and the world still spins goin' around and round and round...
(Get your stamps on your passport up, you dig what I'm saying
It's next level shit man)
(This ain't revolutionary it's evolutionary
Evolve my nigga)
And the, and the world still spins goin' round and round and round

[Verse 1: Fashawn]
Starve myself like Ghandi on behalf of my art
Believe I give you my all, never half of my heart, breathe for you
Travel millions of miles at jet speed for you
Even overseas we're blue
Keep it regional? I had no reason to
Art minus the easel, I'm unbelievable
Fled the coast just to change the climates, came at Islands
Puff on the loud 'til my whole gang was silent
My change piling, so fly I could change pilots
Campaign whiling, my brain remain clouded
My mind storm, when it's time to perform
To be honest if I clicked it, probably pouring
Your raps bore me, I could define your style
Just ask Maury, take the glory
I take the gouda, you know the story, the avenue I grew up
Niggas thought I trade my old life for a new one, nah

[Hook]
Guess who's back, as if I'd left
Excuse me I been busy
I've been on my grizzly
Had to put on for my city
Guess who's back, as if I'd left
Excuse me I've been my busy
I've been on my busy
Had to put on for my city
Guess who's back

[Verse 2: Fashawn]
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
Nah, that's just a grizzly representing this game
Mississippi roots, I descended from slaves
Far from Lynchburg, but I know where niggas hang
I just spent enough dollars on my chain
So much, I done seen to dollars turn into change, holla
I want to be royalty to the rap scholars
Make hits, take hits like Math Hoffa
Fash hotter than a favela in Guatemala
8 baby mamas sittin' in the sauna
I wasn't KKK but I understood
Why it's hard to hibernate in my hood
Before I ever seen an itinerary
I made 57 visits to the cemetery
From a derelict, to a diety
Easily I make a atheist believe in me, now

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Fashawn]
Fuck anybody who thought it was over, literally
Only thing I left was my mark on the culture
Niggas fear me, clearly they are not on my level
I'm a prophet, a rebel, obviously ghetto
Cockin' my metal, autograph signer
When I stop at Valero, had a 12 year old kid tell me I was his hero
But instead of a cape, I wear a cap
Who's to say I alter my faith, that ain't a fact
Even before adolescence, Fash was destined
Craft perfected from a dirty pad I sketched in
From lad to legend, I made it to London
Imagine if I had stayed in the dungeon, nigga
I would have never signed to Esco, never rhymed with Rakim
Tell me, how could I ever let go huh?
Your fantasy ain't fuckin' with my facts
Somebody tell these bustas out the back
Shawn, stacks
I'm back

[Outro: (Fashawn)]
Excuse me I've been busy
I've been on my grizzle
Had to put on for my city, but
(Somebody tell 'em that I'm back, nigga)
Excuse me I've been busy
I've been on my grizzle
Had to put on for my city, but[Produced by Exile]

[Verse 1: Fashawn]
I still hit the swap meet to get some socks cheap
Kids playing hopscotch where they cock heat
Do a figure eight, let the tire screech
In the 559 tryna find a beach
Young efé, young jefé
Half black, half esé
To the norteno's, to the trece's
Blue rag, red rag, all sets, hey
Can't be no punk
In the back yard boogie with the double dutch jump
To a old time freak playing humpty hump
In Pomona, Suga Free, LBC, G-Funk
In the F grizzly's where they throw them G's up
Hair all permed looking like Jesus
Not yet what I'm destined to become
Know exactly where to go if I'm ever on the run
[Hook: Fashawn]
Golden state of mind
The only state that I can call mine
See they keep makin' it
And they keep takin' this
Golden state of mind
(Gold state of mind)
Everybody love the sunshine
But it ain't all palm trees and women
Indeed we livin' in the
Golden state of mind

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
We meet up at the cemetery just to stay in touch
Visiting loved ones cause we miss 'em so much
And how you love that, the progress is obvious
That's why girls see the Huarache's and wanna body us
Never heard Uptown Anthem, but she the naughtiest
It's like God gave us our own land to grow
Marijuana plants and sweet potatoes you know
Some corn for tortillas and blank campus Adidas
And a little bit of time to enjoy what's left
A train on Crenshaw huh, what's next?
Been weighing in the plants though
So I'mma spend 750 on a house in View Park, fuck a Lambo
This guns and there's butter get yo' ammo
Bandanna's like Rambo
Cause Cali's gon' stand strong
From Bobby Seale and Eldridge Cleaver
To Dom Kennedy and Fashawn

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Fashawn]
Yeah, no place like home
A OG say these California streets ain't paved for gold
Dayton's and Vouges only way you can roll
Say a prayer young nigga, try and save your soul
Soldiers die everyday, swear nobody is safe
When killers migrate just to live and die in L.A
(Big city of dreams)
L.A, learn how to hold your weight living in the golden state
Get 25 or the L for unloading the 8
Come and pay us a visit, Coast of the Pacific
Just to be specific, loads of pretty bitches
In addition to the CHP
Roll a eighth, hit the bay, bump some E-A-Ski
And send a R.I.P to Mac D-R-E
Real recognize real, we don't need I.D
And if it wasn't for the west you wouldn't need a vest
For your Jimmy in the city of sex, once again it's the F

[Hook][Verse 1: Fashawn]
When she called, I had a knife to my wrist
Feeling like life ain't make sense
See, I just quit my job, sick of flipping burgers
And living in my aunt's garage
So I just let it ring
Sitting there, drowning in a bottle of Jim Beam
Thinking to myself, she was 'posed to be my queen
Feel like a bad dream
And I just want to wake up, walked in the house
Caught some nigga digging her out, him and his spouse
Remember when we first confessed we loved one another
I was cool with her pops, she was tight with my mother
As crazy as it sounds, think I still love her
Enough to take my own life, left me with nothing
But a broken heart, suicidal thoughts
A 12-inch blade, real, real sharp
Phone is still ringing, so I picked up the call
Let go of the knife, let it drop to the floor, damn

[Hook: Fashawn]
(When I am sleeping)
Some days, I don't even want to wake up
(When I am sleeping, I cannot keep the lights)
(When I am sleeping)
Some days, I don't even want to wake up
(When I am sleeping, I cannot keep the lights)

[Verse 2: Fashawn]
When she called, he had a knife to his wrist
Contemplating if life made sense
See, he just quit his job
Sick of flipping burgers and living in the garage
So he just let it ring
Didn't even check the caller ID
Thought about his girlfriend cheating on him
He caught her in the bed with another woman
And another man, couldn't understand how you can crush
A person's heart in the palm of your hands
Now he's depressed, even thinking suicidal
Like how you go from a lover to a rival?
Bottle of Jack, knife on his lap, death on his mind
Matter of time before he just snaps
But he answers the phone, it's his mother on the other end
Pleading that he needs to come home
He puts the knife down at the sound of her voice
Hesitant about making that choice
Wrong or right, that phone call might have saved his life
He said to himself

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Fashawn]
She could've been his wife, he could've been her husband
Could've had a family, wonder where the love went
What caused her to be unfaithful, was it him
Or the young stud that she met at the gym?
Always kept a smile, knew how to pretend
Never thought his life might come to an end
She reflects on the days when they were best friends
But this is now, and that was then
She awakes to the news, he committed suicide
Her heart drops and she begins to cry
Thinking of their first kiss back in junior high
Didn't even get the chance to say goodbye
But it's because of her, he's no longer alive
Worst part about it, he never knew why
And everything he thought to be true was a lie
Died with a picture by his side
And a letter that read, it said

[Hook]

[Outro]
Just another episode in my area code, area code
Just another episode in my area code
Some days, I don't even want to wake up
(When I am sleeping, I cannot keep the night)
Sometimes people get trapped in their mind
They just want to escape
But it feels like they stuck
So we find ways to escape
Some people even hurt themselves
Some hurt others
But it'll be better tomorrow
It'll all be better tomorrow, I promise[Verse 1: Fashawn]
The cannon, he tucked it
Underneath his banana republic
Hit your man out in public
Understand he was thugging
Pitching grams you was hustling
He ain't scramble for nothing
Knew how to handle a onion
Done with nickel and dimin'
He was getting cosignment
Kept a chick in the climate
Wanted a '64 Impala
Had a clique that was solid
Wouldn't snitch on his rivals
But his bitch was unloyal
Ran her lips to the five-o
Takes a sip from the bottle
Fills a clip up with hollows
Grips on his pistol then he dips with his rollows
They on a mission for murder, but all he want is the paper
In the Chevy smoking heavy Hennessy with no chase
Started of small-time 'till the kid graduated
To a contract killer, jacking niggas for Daytons
After he got his rims, got his whip candy-painted
Few weeks later he's sitting at his arraignment for a

[Hook: Fashawn]
'64 Impala, '64 Impala
All I wanted was a '64 Impala
Fuck a 600 Benz, give me a '64 Impala
Sitting on Daytons, on a mission for dollars
In my '64 Impala, '64 Impala
All I wanted was a '64 Impala
Fuck a 600 Benz, give me a '64 Impala
Sitting on datents, on a mission for dollars

[Verse 2: Murs]
No matter where you from, the goal has always been
To have a '64 Impala, motherfuck a Benz
Want them hundred spokes, not them low pros
I'm fucking with my folks, they got them low-lows
A '96 is dope, a '64 is classic
We might just stop to make that motherfucker hop in traffic
You see the double S, it's like a turbo jet
Free rolling candy, now watch us serve your set
You ain't seen nothing yet, we waiting on the other half
My baby floating over asphalt like a hover-craft
She over 40, bro, but ain't over the hills
She stay down for me, so I know that it's real
So much chrome in the grill, she lighting up the sky
You rolling up on me, but motherfucker, why
New pumps with a ten switch box
You about to get embarrassed while your friends just watch, nigga

[Hook]

[Outro: Fashawn]
Only in California[Verse 1: Rakaa]
Look out, watch it, approach with caution
The A-L-C spins like the chrome revolvin’
Bang out, ventilate, air your brain out
While your girl hit the front row to call my name out
It’s the California golden state sunshine glarin’ on ya
Back from Amsterdam thinking kush is more than marijuana
Pure Americana, we’re election victims
Only athletes and hustlers know the metric system
I’m touched, son of a reverend
I send the tithe, play the round, but I don’t hustle heaven
Military hood rhymes like the mic’s a weapon
Militant good times like Michael Evans
Dilated Rakaa rocks the crown of thorns properly
Wear it as a badge of honor, tell ‘em there’s no stopping me
Keep your ojos peeled or the rojo spills
I don’t bang, but I’m loco still

[Verse 2: Fashawn]
I’m a keep doing what I’m doing till you’re done with me
Till it ain’t fun to me
Exposed like somebody unzipped me
It’s going down like rum, whiskey
I puff sticky, like my hundreds and my ones crispy
Just a poet under pressure, only turned him to a diamond
Digging for gold far from my mind, now I’m a grown up
Some think I’m a loner, but for those who know
I roll deep as the Atlantic Ocean with a band of soldiers
Cockin’ they cannons, we rollin’, roll up a gram of that doja
We expandin’, controlling Los Angeles like we own it
Don’t be fooled by the lights, never seen Paradise
More like a pair of dice
Shit, I’m gambling my life away
Hustling, scrambling, damn it I could die today
Immortalized through the rhyme, C-A state of mind
Wish they had a flavor like mine, just the way I was designed

[Verse 3: Evidence]
It’s time to pay the piper, I don’t calm down, I’m hyper
Vent this, Lord forgive those that trespass against us
I don’t trust, I’m never left defenseless
Talking to a brick wall, dawg, fuck friendship
I mean, nowadays it’s all one and the same
Most fronting really only out for your fame
Most dawgs involved for their interest
I just met you, it’s just business
Game recognize game since day one
A-L-C move to the beat of the same drum
E-V stick the topic of discussion
I heard if they smile too much, don’t trust ‘em
Turn the other cheek, my mom say
I pay homage to your diss like Carlito Brigante
Benny Blanco’s back, I be the last to laugh
Look out, if it looks too good, it’s a trap

[Verse 4: Defari]
Aces high, my face is painless
The barrel’s stainless, the handle’s plastic
The weed I bags, oops, I mean contain it
The Porsche, of course I press, I fast lane it
Impress through the city of the West that made me
U.C.L.A. baby, Los Angeles gave me
This unique style, many unfit to imitate
Defari, the name mean top legitimate
I mean legitimate, I’m full-time with benefits
You’re just a little kid, you’re pissing your parents off
See, you the type to pop a case of no way
We the type to pop a case of rosé
No way can you fuck with us on no day
Viva la cannabis, yes, let’s blow away
I know a chemist whose beats punch holes like the dentist
He also from the town where they with the business

[Sample]
You know as an artist I’ve been able to travel around L.A. and learn from different artists, not just people from where I came from, but people from the west side of L.A., eastside, the north and the south. Some of them guys are still painting, some of ‘em not. Like some of them, they got older. I guess they moved on to different things, but you still have some people that were like real good, but—L.A. have a lot of good people from all over[Intro: Fashawn and sample]
"...But then I thank you for the love you give me, God! And I know, I don't deserve it. It hurts me to say that..."
Yeah, 'Shawn, huh nigga
The most shady: Alchy baby. In full effect. It's the start of the end
Amen...
Uh... uh, how should I start this?

[Verse 1: Fashawn]
Went to sleep drunk, woke up sober, hungover
The skunk roller; who need a lung donor? Young loaner
Gun toter, with a tongue coated in Aspirin
Blown off a wax-strip; zoning, I'm boning an actress
Diagnosis my DNA, and get flowed and extracted
Exposing your hat tricks, posers need practice
I got more props and respect than you
For what I cultivate, gotta cut a check into
Dollar signs and decimals, the grind's impeccable
I brainstorm while your mind is weatherproof
Built with time for the crime on schedule
Eyes dilated off a high that's medical
I rise to the occasion, arrive with something Asain
With thighs like Mary J. Blidge, Sanaa Lathan
Fuck the smiley faces, homie I'm out of patience
You just sour cause your final hour's a jinx, nigga

[Hook (x2): Fashawn]
We knew it was over, before it even started
May we bow our heads, for the daily departed
I welcome you to the end now, Amen
I welcome you to the end now, Amen

[Verse 2: Fashawn]
I put a cease to the speculation, I'm dedicated
You'll see the bombs getting detonated, miseducated
You a featherweight, forever hating, I'm Freddy meets Jason
My coalition congregating, kind of like the Masons
And the temple, medicated my mental
Disrespectful, I defecate on your demo
Celebrity, I'm as celebrated as Leno
Conversate in a limo, ain't even know you was lame
You was late on the memo, should be raking in insults
Pussy nigga, you probably stay on your menstrual
I'm just raping the tempo, cautious as if I was
Drag-racing a rental, I recommend you
Hit the exit when I step in the venue
Or get decked and get dentalled; dammit, I'm detrimental
And these Emcees most definitely know my MO
Murdering everything in my path, my name's Fash, motherfucker

[Hook (x2)][Verse 1: Fashawn]
Yeah, the ambition of a young nigga
The transition of a drug dealer
Under surveillance, always somebody watching
Stop clocking my moose, you leave me no option
Unmask this lames, look 'em dead in their eyes
I reckon you recognize I'm forever fly
Something gotta give, cause I'm dying inside
I don't know how to live, I pray to the sky
I'm seeking a blessing, I'm seeking direction
I'm lost in the reefer, knee deep in depression
And your problems are meager, not even an issue
Everyday is a dilemma, I'm in need of a pistol
Loyalty is my demise, feel a G 'till I die
Take this shit to the grave, and it ain't my homocide
Look at what I became, who the fuck is the blame?
Fell out of love for fame, I'm just stuck in the game

[Hook]
And it goes, and it goes, and it goes
And it goes, and it goes, and it goes
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
And it goes, and it goes, and it goes
And it goes, and it goes, and it goes
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down

[Verse 2: Murs]
We on Peak Boulevard, just a little north
Gloverdale, we out there everyday up on that porch
Haze smoking back and forth, pay in and out of court
Me I was just rapping having dreams of a super sport
'96 Chevy, shit started getting heavy
First they pop off, then we pop off, but I just wasn't ready
So hold that banger so I had to make a change of pace
Still in danger cause the other side they know my face
Detention hard to swallow, feel like I'm getting followed
Only nigga from the block with that white Eldorado
Paranoid as fuck, feeling like they out to get me
.45 in the truck, my God, God is with me
I'm riding down the city, intentions for the worst
Cause I be damned if I slip up and let them get me first
I do my dirt all by my lonely, not from any hood
I pop the truck, I cock it back, we about to see what's really good

[Hook][Hook: Samples]
Suddenly I hear a banging sound
I can hear the bass playing much too softly turn up the volume

[Verse 1 : Evidence]
Let me start with the evidence and kill the allegations
Its low treble high bass my kill for calibration
Syncing up perfect to the rhythm of my own kick
Driven by my own tone alone I make the poem fit
And I ain't known for taking no shit
I'm known for hi-fi and putting it on down the low bits
It's more hits, more green in scenery, they (turn up the volume)
It's man vs machinery
I am now to the future what the scene'll be
The decks'll probably wobble but they never fall easily
I rap repeatedly into a (?)
So we pouring out these bottles and there's more to recruit (I can hear the)
Voices in my head, telling me, Ev, you have just beasted
So why don't we respect the game and just, recess
I'm like fuck that, get the loot, save the queen
We got another fucking kill screen to reset

[Hook]

[Verse 2 : Fashawn]
I slap the shit out of you with an aphorism
Attack the rhythm
More than a mac I'm a menace, shatter your Izm
I arrive, like I traveled in mach 5
And never caught a stop sign
And, disappear like a mad magician
On a savage mission
Chronic and Bali shag I'm twistin
Got a nigga feeling past the buildin, I'm so high
Fully loaded like a Glock 9 the minute they (Turn up the volume)
That's when I start to jot rhymes, And lock lines
I'm slick as an ox to the jugular
A prophet it's just not for the fuck of it uh uh
It's the mafia, suck a dick
Guns bigger than Theophilus London's Lips (I can hear the)
Cops coming, the spot jumping I'm getting ghost
From a block of young'ns with ox cutters hid in they coat
Won't stop thuggin you cocksuckers should get a dose
Simpletons listen close, truest spit I ever spoke
It's F

[Hook]

[Verse 2 : Alchemist]
Ayyy Carumbaaa
Hang ten cowabunga
Amazing larry ride the wave without going under
Chop down a forest use a mac truck to tow the lumber
I wrung his neck then cut a blank check and wrote a number
Thou chow dumbeth (look in the skyyy)
It is I, Lord Steppington My cup overruneth
The Kosher man Ashevitte
Sell him a couch like the sofa man at Levitz
(Turn up the volume)
Rap so whoopdee friggin doo
I'm gettin yada yada
Breed is rare like a tasmanian chupacabra
Scuba diver, makeshift craft Macgyver
Bomb specialist
Dynamite blast survivor
Put out the fires
Peel off and burn the tires
Pull the wires
Screws loose I turn the pliers
Piss on your poster burn a stack of fliers
Burn dope and blow the smoke for promotion
Attract the buyers

[Hook][Verse 1]
Now I was
Sitting on a mountain of dilemmas
Guzzling 40 ounces to the liver
Thinking about my life my life
How I was living in strife
We would be out all night
In front of my building
In the gutter the impoverished civilians
It was life or death
I was just trying to make a killing
Jobs wasn't hiring
Mama lost her mind again
Daughter needed diapers
And daddy needed a Vicodin
Baby girl getting older
And it won't be long
Til she got the weight of the world on her shoulders
Try to be calm
This chronic prevent me from doing niggas bodily harm
Gotta remind me I'm Shawn
Cuz sometimes I be lost
Fantasizing about cars
Go to sleep with a picture of a Maserati on my wall
From them projects and buildings
To a yacht and some slippers
Had them Christopher Wallace intentions
I had to get it

[Hook (2X)]
Big dreams, big dreams the whole city was mine
Big dreams, big dreams, Benz, beepers and 9's
Big dreams, big dreams, the only limit's the sky
Got me feeling like the world is mine
Now close your eyes

[Verse 2]
Now everybody has a dream
But not every man has a plan
For some it becomes a reality
Slight chance but hey
You, you take it for what it's worth
Even if it just so happens your face end up in the dirt
Where I'm from the definition of work
Is a zipper some purp, or a key of that girl
I swear the city's bizerk
Wanted to travel the world
Leave a dent on this earth
I guess a nigga in search
Always trying to find an exit
Was tired of living reckless
In my mind envisioned myself driving in a Lexus
Uh, you'll know ya nig got it made
When the cops never raid and the crib got a maid
Why life as a shorty gotta be fucked up?
I just want what's mine I ain't asking for much
I mean, I had dreams and rapping was one
It was either that or ski mask and a gun
But you don't hear me tho

[Hook (2X)]

[Outro]
Know what I'm saying
Close your eyes man
Picture that man
Close your eyes and envision this
You know what I'm saying
It's the life
It's a Cole world
Big cars, expensive linen
You know what it is
Grizzly City to the Ville nigga
Real niggas connect
Know what I'm saying respect
Fayettnam all the way to Grizzly City nigga
Big Dreams
It's the F[Exile] Yo Santiago!
[Fashawn] What?
[Exile] What’s up?
[Fashawn]
What’s up, Nothin’ much
Chillin’ in the cut
A bottle of Mickey’s and a dutch
How you feelin’ Ex?
[Exile]
I’m chillin, high ceiling on the walls
Got a feelin, all of y’all
Feelin’ us like feelin’ balls

[Fashawn]
Pause!
Like cat feet, we smoke mad weed
Hashish, same outfit since last week

[Exile]
Trash beats, slang
Like hit chicks in back seats
Good looks and ask me Fas
You’re my dog, like Lassie


[Fashawn]
Light an incense
My million dollar windpipe expensive
I rip mics intensive
The nigga they like to mention
Alias ‘Fashawn’, government is confidential
I’m type essential
Be upon my mental, strike the pencil
And in the notebook, there go a hundred jabs
No hook - Don’t need a punchline
I kick the shit to make you unwind
One rhyme will stimulate your mental state for certain
Ain’t even heard the second verse yet - shattered your work and...


[Exile]
I be lurkin’ after dark with a pen that transcend
From the pad to your pad
Where you live, Graffiti mind
Rhyme great, to MPC, this dude MC
Get blindfold
Walk off the plank, the water’s empty

[Fashawn]
Simply, Fash bring the the floods and the flash
Like Hurricane Katrina when I grab a pen and pad
Hit the lab like a lick of difference, I don’t need a mask
I’m far from a pretender, on my grizzly
Need a millie in in the stash

[Exile]
See I’m the illest, feeling to high to the ceiling there
Maybe move this album from a thousand to a million
Coming from the Section Eight to Ten dealers there
Big titty feelers there, who want to eat some chips
I work potato chips, and then they suck a dick
But I choose to hit the skins, ‘cause the skins be hella thick
I be wasted on the block, peace to Coss
I’m faded coast to coast
I missed a sister hit her in the coochie
With the booty - no!

[Fashawn]
Kicks in the fetus
If you step on my Adidas
We gon’ probably have to fight
Lucky I ain’t wear my Nikes
Coming from the far left
Can’t believe yall slept, over nearly everyone
Ask KRS: Knowledge, Respect, Survival
You already know the motto
You niggas couldn’t see me underwater wearing goggles

[Exile]
I squabble like a UFC, you blind to it
Hit you with a left, no hook, your eyes fluid
Black eyed, y’all knew it
Nike grabbed the mic, Fash and just do it!

[Fashawn] Nah you just do it
[Exile] No Fash you just do it
[Fashawn] Yo Ex, just do it
[Exile]: OK, grabbed the microphone and just threw it


[Fashawn]
And I caught it
Critics say he’s psychotic
Split personality, Shawn and Santiago
Raw so take caution at large
Make sure the doors shut and locked
Tonight, I’m turning rappers into martyrs
So Ex, just do it

[Outro]

[Exile] Nah Fash, you just do it
[Fashawn] Nah, you just do it
[Exile] Nah, you just do it
[Fashawn] Ayo, Ex - just do it
[Exile] Nah Fash, you just do it

[Fashawn] Ayo Brav -  just do it
[Exile] Ayo, Coss -  just do it

[Fashawn] U-N-I  - just do it
[Exile] Hey Blame -  just do it

[Fashawn] Ayo, Ev just do it
[Exile] Aloe - just do it

[Fashawn] Yo Heck -  just do it
[Exile] Yo Blu -  just do it

Do it, do it, do it
Duet - this is the duet![Verse One]:
I started off just a boy trying to find himself
On an earth that I hardly knew
Life just wasn't what it seemed on the TV screen
I can't lie though, my eyes were glued
I grew up in the US
Off welfare checks
No stability, we'd always move
Either in with my aunt cause my mama ain't work
Our favorite day of the month: the first
That's when we'd go shop
We'd go spend
Spent most my time with my so-called friends
Hanging out in the streets watching the world go by
So stuck in the moment I forgot I was even alive
I didn't know about death until my grandma passed
To tell the truth it never crossed my mind
She told me pray before I go outside
And trust no man cause you'd be surprised
When the boy meets world

[Hook]:
Now you've came so far
Look at where you've been
It's time to see the world
Now you've came so far
Look at where you've been
It's time to see the world

[Verse Two]:
By '96 it was me and my sis
Big bro left was like he ain't exist
Dad was never around
I ain't even trip, cause I had a step father
When Randy ain't bother
Was in the late eighties when him and my mama split
Soon as I was born he winds up in the pen
I wind up with a pen, a paper and a dream
Before I realized this is where my life begins
Started writing poems when I hit the group home
First time I remember ever feeling alone
Whole lot to handle for a nine year old
In my mind fantasized about flying to Rome
Leaving everything behind even at a tender age
Uncle always thought I was going through a phase
Until I hit the studio
Until I hit the stage
Just scribbling my life on the page
When the boy meets world

[Hook]:
Now you've came so far
Look at where you've been
It's time to see the world
Now you've came so far
Look at where you've been
It's time to see the world

[Verse Three]:
Started rhyming in junior high school
Out of love
All I needed was some fly shoes
Hung with the thugs
Wouldn't think cause of my IQ
I sold drugs just to bubble and buy food
And blow bud
High school was different
A lot more attention
Every day played hooky
I was hardly in attendance
Always in some mischief
Until I got religious
Selling bean pies, spent time with the minister
And that lasted about a year
Before you know it I was back maneuvering with my peers
Met Hec Saprano at the age of sixteen
Was just a lil nigga with big dreams
It was '06 when I first hit the scene
Rocking shows without my team
When people always said I was a star
Can't believe that I made it this far
Now the boy meets the world

[Hook]:
Now you've came so far
Look at where you've been
It's time to see the world
Now you've came so far
Look at where you've been
It's time to see the world

-----

[Verse One]:
Swear I can't figure why
My brothers sell 'caine
To survive in these times, I don't know who to blame
Could blame the media, like
They're the reason I might
Just start a revolution
Know the devil recruitin'
They got us overseas
Killin' people that bleed
The same color as your brother but we too blind to see
We're very much the same
Despite what you believe
Know we can make a change
But it's the same old song
Song, song, song, song, song, song, song, song, song
Said it's the same old
Song

[Hook]:
Now if we took a little time
Swallowed all our pride
We could fix the situation
But it's the same old song
The same old song
Now if we took a little time
Took a look inside
We could stop killing each other
But it's the same old song
The same old song

[Verse Two]:
I sit back in a daze
Swear the world's insane
Get so high I could fly but I'd rather escape
Find my oasis in the most exotic of places
Wish I had the solution to these problems we facing
They got us overseas
Killing people that bleed
The same color as your brother but we too blind to see
We're very much the same
Despite what you believe
Know we can make a change
But it's the same old song
Song, song, song, song, song, song, song, song, song
Said it's the same old song

[Hook]:
Now if we took a little time
Swallowed all our pride
We could fix the situation
But it's the same old song
The same old song
Now if we took a little time
Took a look inside
We could stop killing each other
But it's the same old song
The same old song

[Outro] [Fashawn talking]:
They say a change is gonna come. They say look for a better tomorrow. I think I found mine. See, everything you go through in life. All the bullshit, the drama, the turmoil. It all, just makes you who you are. So I thank God for my life. The ups and down. And I wanna thank you. You and yours. For tunin' in to Boy Meets World. Shout out to Exile. The whole DS[Verse 1: Fashawn]
I was in love with the block, call it the avenue Jones
Through the village we just happened to roam
Knuckleheads, bad to the bone
And every single snotnose had an addict at home
I drunk Vodka and juice with the fatherless youth
Everyday in between the hours of two we ate taco's and hoot
Every now and then somebody would shoot
They hit that younging with a stray while he was tying his shoe
Let if off then they hopped in the coupe
And nobody said a word about the body on the curb
Hit the homie Flacko, that's the vato with the herb
I mean papi cool, but his posse full of herbs
Got a Chronic from the 'burbs
Around the same time I was trying to learn
How to pick a lock with a hanger, load shots in the chamber
Get low from the cops and the neighbors
Boys in the hood

[Verse 2: Like]
Born and raised in killa Cali, dreaming one day the city's ours
Young niggas hopping fences licking chili powder
Eddie Bauers and doctors passed, Stockton to Ladera Heights
Young kids wearing Nike's sharing bikes, tearing mics up
Kept a nice cut in the fades
Never affiliated, but my niggas bang getting paid
Shouts to my grandma, still in the J's
Coco ave. fo-fo mag tucked away when the po-po's pass
Walked to the stove, but don't step on the old folk grass
A 80's baby like Thrifty's and Pick 'N Save
Wear the wrong colors might as well dig your grave
Ditch your school to throw hands, stick and move
Bagging chicks at Fox Hills like shit was cool
Different dudes, go by a set of different rules
We obviously ain't got shit to lose, boys in the hood

[Verse 3: Blu]
I got the old 3 sitting on my neck for my set
Big B sitting on my chest for the best
Headed to the East, raised in the West
In them streets I think you need a cage and a vest
Ducking strays on my way to church, on my way to work
Blazed trying to lace a verse so I can pay the first
Blu be copping chains, shopping days 'til my pockets hurt
Rob a purse if she see me in a soggy shirt
But on the turf niggas flipping work, chickens chirp
On a flirt, nonsense, no smirk, jerkface, tell the jerk
Burgers in a shank
If she think she worth what she work she need a break
Pissing off the city with a silly cigarette on my BMX
With my Rollie on and my Holy text
Telling Moses ''you can lead us through the sea''
But you can't keep seas out the streets
Boys in the hood

[Verse 4]
After school niggas eating Cheeto's by the tether-ball
Tony Starks had me fiending for them leather Clarks
5-0-1's, I'm starched, creased up
Niggas going chesting, we watched Darkwing duck
Bad niggas rocking duck tails, thermos with the lunch pail
Taking trips to Catalina and niggas swear we upscale
Puff L's, OE cans of Mickey
Real Venice before they turn that shit to Abbot Kinney
That past is in me skating through that 818
Homies out the pen like Ray Lewis gaining weight
It ain't for play
Thought you know them boys that banging the whole hood
Shook, just off of Northridge quaking
Ta-daw, nigga, domino!, my uncle bumped the Commodores
Humping on the sub and just be done before their mama home
Reminiscing with these poisonous goods
Dopeboy, get that dope, boy, boys in the hood

[Verse 5]
Lost in a promised land milking honey's
A field of dreams, this the city of angel
Set your neck on the line, that shit'll get strangled
What you expect? Besides connected, the culdesac counsil
Starter jackets, and Sauconys, the sauce in me
And a sordid past
Fresh from court, no boarding pass
Pour more with a taller glass
Monetary support towards some college class
A wealth of knowledge, hustle mania
Game became placed to make with power
Sitting on the stoop like a substitute, solid
Chopping it with the barbers displacing transplanted
Sipping a chalice in childish comfort
The colors got colored improper
Shuffling shuckers, cool suckers, cards for audit[Verse 1]
If you wanna know, I'm the one you and your man should fear
Bring the champ out, the champ is here
My momma should have named me Victor
Cause victory is all I see
When I look in the mirror, couldn't be clearer
Uh, undisputed, youngest to do it
Nice with the jab like Tim Bradley
Any weight-class, light or heavy I be ready
You rhymers ain't even kinda deadly
Follow the [?]
My entourage in the V.I swallowing Belve'
Here's a toast to living young and wealthy
And for the record I never lost
Gotta respect the God
I'm dealing bars like a deck of cards

[Hook]
[?]
And I never been beat
Big or small  knock you off of your feet
Boy I'm a champion (What?)
A champion (What?)
If I can't do it then it can't be done
I got the heart of a fighter I can conquer anything
Plus I know my way around the ring
Boy I'm a champion (what?)
A champion (what?)
If I can't do it then it can't be done

[Verse 2]
This here simple and plain
Put the pen in the page
In the winter I train
Scribbling sentences [?]
100 miles, like I'm jogging the cross lane
Golden child
Or better yet a king
Show respect, I say hello to my cherry red beam
Like ring!
Me and my [?] on a  mission for green
My right hook nice, but the left will make 'em lean
Bet I bring him to his knees
Something you never seen
In a circle of winners, they never mention you
Must I remind them I'm invincible

[Hook][Hook] (x2)
She had to confess that I am the best
That I am, that I am, that I am the best
Confess, confess
She had to confess that I am the best

[Verse 1]
Wa da da dang, wa da da da da dang
Step into the party with Baccardi in my veins
I knock her dang, her body I gotta bang
Like it was a 9mm that I aim
Not a train, I prolly forgot her name
Arrive with the gang, the posse that I claim
Play Monopoly games, profiting off pain
Hear the boppin' and go hop in her Range
The best at it according to sex addicts
Made her wet then made a mess out of fresh fabrics
Uh she 'bout to cum, I should just let her
Hon' it doesn't get better than this six letter

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 2: Fashawn]
Stop the blood clot lying, no, him no lying
When I gave it to her she swore that she saw Zion (Lawd of mercy)
Hit it hard yeah I gave her all iron
Boom, more fire, I torch your whole attire
I scorch writers at liquor store cyphers
The poor righteous, teach you with arthritis
Patois of a rap star, I'm mac hard
Bag bitches in the back yard and dash off
Treat me like a flask cause they swallowing Fashawn
Aaw, why did I have to go and attack y'all
Hey, wa da da dang, a whole lotta dollars they gain
Whole lotta shotters with bottles and models we gotta bring

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Ja bless the child who can hold his own, no
Emotion from the homie cosy in the throne
Who got it sown
Poems I'm penning, prone to pitching
Product of the zone I entered
I'm over the limit, scolding my critics
Forget a title you couldn't hold my attention
Oh did I mention, took control of the imprint
Strolling, limping, with the soul of a pimp is
Archbishop meets Bart Simpson, starts kissing
Shawn throws bombs from long distance
Too many magazine to let off, my palms itching
Either I'm insane or you not in my lane
Why do I gotta be modest I'm bout to body the game

[Hook] (x2)[Intro]
C-O-P-Y-C-A-T
C-O-P-Y-C-A-T

[Verse 1: Fashawn]
Uh
Your flow far from authentic
Mm - you're all gimmicks
Seen too many small niggas get large
Augmented
I increase and inflict scars on all nemeses
With these thoughts I'm scribbling
Shawn the mortician it is
Critical you're style's original
Nah, folk wouldn't make it to wax - you digital
Cats bite you like the shit's allowed
I send 'em down, show 'em how to rip a crowd
And then grip a crown
King
With this hip-hop thing
You had a fling
Me? I'm like holy matrimonies and wedding rings
Married to the craft
Your catalogue I bury in a flash
Remind me of Jim Carrey in The Mask
Perpetrating and pretending to rap
That ain't being innovative, that's identity theft, nigga
Get your own
I'm sort of like Oprah
Dropping meteors on those who mediocre

[Hook]
C-O-P-Y-C-A-T, why are you living a lie?
Everybody wanna be somebody else
When you're doing you, you don't need nobody's help
Don't be a
C-O-P-Y-C-A-T, why are you living a lie?
Everybody wanna be somebody else
When you're doing you, you don't need nobody's help
Don't be a copycat
No, don't be a copycat
Nah, don't be a *cat noise*
Don't be a copycat

[Verse 2: Fashawn]
If I wasn't the letter F
I would probably be 20syl
20 years later I'd be dropping bombs still
You honestly should pay homage and chill
Or get grilled
Like a omelette trying to climb in my field
You need to enhance your IQ
To do what I do
Purchase a passport and fly where I flew
Have some self-respect
Get some self-esteem
Imagine
Dream what nobody else could dream
Impostors
Won't get a slot on my roster
Reminder: You're not him and you're not her
But that portrayal might just get you an Oscar
Tell me: are you a minister, or are you a mobster?
One minute you Muslim and the next you a Rasta
One second you're Weezy and the next you're Big Poppa
Nah, don't even think of dropping a tape
These cats don't cultivate, they just copy and paste
It's like that

[Hook]

Roger thatIt's madness...
It's tragic...

[Verse 1]
Went from a Jansport to a Louis bag
The young backpacker turned Samsonite Man
I sit in laugh out in Switzerland getting grams
Non-negotiable here's a list of my demands, couple quoteables
I can't even feel my hands, that's what the dro will do
Still can't wait to hit Japan, maybe Tokoyo, or Osaka
Another plane, and to say that I'm different would only make me the same
So I'm the same
As you, as one, let's remain
Try to rearrange the human brain
And the heart that's a start let's provoke change
Fuck a gold chain, you stuck in the old days
Sounds funny don't it
I'm so young and determined
Was young and hopeless
Cowboy, gun in my holster
Now I got my aim and I'm focused
One foot in the game, the other on Shields Ave
It's tragic, living in a habitat of madness
Patty cake, patty cake, niggas bake and bag bricks
Keep a shooter like the Mavericks
Gotta keep a ruger when maneuvering through traffic
I don't do nothing but rhyme
Give me a second bet you I can change the color of time
Just hit rewind, guarantee you it will free your fucking mind
Hope you lost...

[Hook] x2
All the places I go
Swear I've been here before
They ain't seen what I've seen
They don't know what I know

[Verse 2]
Free your mind
Hope you got yours cause I think I lost mine a long time ago
Black clouds follow wherever Santiago roll
A desperado, out on my own
Light another spliff, jot another poem
You'll say I was right when I died
Just know I did it every day of my life
You know why cause I get paid just to say what I like
And get high, only dilemma is me making this flight
It's my life

You don't get to travel the world
Talk my shit
This shit is crazy
There's nothing like it man

[Hook] x2[Hook: Ab-Soul]
Because it's 1-8-7 on a under cover cop
Who you think you are? Donnie Brasco?
Who you think you are? Donnie Brasco? (Gotta be made)
Who you think you are? Donnie Brasco?
Because it's 1-8-7 on a under cover cop
Who you think you are? Donnie Brasco?
Who you think you are? Donnie Brasco? (Gotta be made)
Who you think you are? Donnie Brasco?

[Verse 1: Fashawn]
He wore a leather coat, Cazal shades
A gold pinky ring, I mean he's got to be paid
Or maybe he's a mobster, probably made
Except I never seen him around, ought to complain
But I got the kids info, heard he was a jeweler
From up up the block I thought of my friend Mueller
That would be our introduction
Call it an ice breaker
I brought him a broken watch just to start a conversation
Who am I
Ugh, Young Lefty my name
But I need not explain
Bled blocks with cain
Over 20 something bodies I'm trying to get out the game
So I ain't got a problem with poppin' one in your brain
Kapeesh
Ride with me but under one condition
Over stand a position this is grown man business
Listen
I can take you under my wing
Or I can take your lights out and let this Desert Eagle sing
Because it's

[Hook]

[Verse 2: One-2]
Aye Yo, my cousin introduced me to his homie
Who told me about some money making schemes he gone show me
G's he gone grow me
To help me get started, I thought it seemed like bologna
Thought he was a phony
But then, a couple of weeks past
He calls me on the cell-y and tells me to meet fast
Brought a brief case with a couple of G's cash
Talked it over with Fash
And gave him the G-pass
He knew all about the spots that we smashed
The robberies, The jewelry, guns, the weed stash
It's usually easy for me to smell a pretender
At the family meetings he's a regular member
Deep in our circle, but I follow my intuition
And tried to warn the bosses, they thought that I was trippin'
Told the guard to pat him down, I fear he's a liar
I put one in his dome, caught him wearing a wire

[Hook] x2[Verse 1: Fashawn]
Trying to see millions in profits
And still be philanthropic
Drilling a Brazilian, as I chill in the tropics
Rockin', like I know Bob Dylan is watchin'
Acid tab for Jimi and Janis Joplin
Hard to get rid of me
I'm like herpes
Known to never show the mic mercy
I gave them content
They wanted controversy
Well, here you have it
Gladly causing the static
Equipped with a big dick
Clip for my automatic
Since back when gangsters still called guns ratchets
I personify a figure you idolize
Rimming in all flavors like Häagen-Dazs
Beggin' to give me top
Never been on a yacht
I left from right on the dock
Fuck yourself with a flesh light
I'm the reason jaguar made an F-type
It's Shawn

[Verse 2: Evidence]
A different wave on the same boat
Did not invent the storm
I just wore the biggest rain coat
Known to let pain go
Known for never same flow
I'm solvin' problems
I'll send the goons and goblins
Never involve a novice
Only time will tell
Only time a watch
Time will clock when confiding to this writer's block
Roll out the carpet red
Arrive like they knew of us
I'm solo in the diamond
Driving like there's two of us
Cause we ain't peace, don't mean it's war
Cause we underground, don't mean we poor
I pose a threat to any beat I'm taking serious
The words passed the margin, delivered with a period
Maybe paranoid, maybe Paris in the staircase
Floating on the high-end foreign airspace
I lift my mind to a rare place
A rare pace between the tortoise and the hare race

[Verse 3: Fashawn]
Straight up out of the gutter I rose
Ducking from po's
Chickenheads clucking when they see the duckets I gross
I'm rugged
Guzzling more
Bundle of dro
More product in production so the customers know I been pumpin
Bare face so you seeing Santiago
You can say I run my cartel like El Chapo
Don't papi look proper in the three-piece?
Stones in my cuff-links, kept the socks knee-length
I'm a menace with a ministry
Crawl through Venice like a centipede, I did indeed
I'm Pistol Pete when a pen in reach
It ain't all about the Benjamins, I been a beast
Never missing a beat, I'm in it too deep, filthy
Grizz is a thief, mission complete, I'm guilty
Of stealing the show
Realest to blow
When I die is the die I'll be done, dealing this dopeLadies and gentleman
Ladies and gentleman
Ladies and gentleman
Are you really ready for some super dynamite soul?

[Verse 1: Guilty Simpson]
I body tracks with a brutal approach flying coach
First class when I'm dropping shit I wrote
Convert cash in airports and splurge on whatever I desire
The lead writer, I street fight ya, ya'll play Street Fighter
Big difference, miles apart, styles is darts
On point I parallel park on street cats
Feed your back a knife, a reckless [?]
Watch your tone around here
Even kingpins get dethroned around here
They don't give a fuck about what they buck buck
Bring me the truck tucked and sleep with tough luck
Harsh reality, spark the Cali tree
In the motor city where they chart fatalities
B-boy stance the place
Cause the poppers gonna pop, the breakers gonna break

[Verse 2: Rass Kass]
I'm one of the depressed children, top billing
If skills would pay the bills I'm worth at least a hundred million
A lot of rappers be illin', hit 'em with the dealing
Turn an overnight villain, catch a case and start squealing
I'm standing on a square like a slice of Sicilian
Afghan vet killing, fucked like the debt ceiling
I treat crabs like my red-haired step children
Slap 'em around, fuck they moms with my sex healing
Word to Marvin Gaye
I put the same gun you bought me to your chest and blow you away
Pause, period periodically delirious
FM radio is wack so I usually bump Serius
Effect the Gucci belts microphone plug
Makes me not very likable
Make all the bitches fight like my dick'll do
Walk into the booth with a mouth full of pick to chews

[Verse 3: Fashawn]
I'll tell you something that you need to learn
You ain't seen beef 'til you seen an urn
If it ain't about money why would I be concerned
If not my Coheeba burn
Yes, flicking ashes on my adversaries
Got a list of maggots that I'd be glad to bury
I used to burn chronic out of bible papers
Street disciple ripping pages out the Book of David
Over the stove with the recipe
Chef Boyar-G flow effortlessly
Your punchlines couldn't make an eye swell
You ain't Mike Jordan you Montell
Silly you for thinking you missle-proof
Now I'm just positioning my pistol to hit your troops
I bridge the gap like a dentist
Reinvented the reinvented, no limit so independent
And I gotta be the villain, I'm probably just a minute
Here's the middle finger case any got offended
Llama in the linen, vodka in my system
Prada with my hands that pray that the father forgive this
Rhyme schemes like mescalin to the fiends
Nothing coming between my regime, naw mean

[Verse 4: Skyzoo]
The menage of a kick and a snare
Between that a mirage for the vision-impaired
I'm in a league where the stars can't fit in they chairs
So when I speak I barrage whoever sittin' in there
The armrest turned conquest, I'm just here to Contra the compress
Automatic concrete your congress
A sixteen sound like I was drumming out
We just trying the Upper Eastside and take the Drummond route
Know me in the building for the walls that be jumping out
I be on my Willis if Janet try and come around
Singing Mo Money, I'm singing Mo Money
Harmony hundreds couldn't get a note from me
Regardless we're on it there's nothing like 'em that be on
The bargain they wanted just walked 'em right into the norm
I loop 'em up a song, open up the beat and
Then name somebody doper than the dope you get from me
And holler when you think of 'em

[Scratching]
From the soul ya'll
Soul
Dynamite soulCan I talk my shit again
I just wanna be El Chapo, check it out

[Verse 1]
Sipping on my vino, listening to Chalino
Gripping on my dick and it's just as big as my ego
She know I'm snatchin' Fritos
It's me ho I'm like the Repo
Man, goddamn, my life is so illegal
Politickin' with Vito, reminisce over Dupree
Desperado bandito, only titles that suit me
Truthfully I'm yo idol, you're homo I'm homicidal
You 21 with a bullet, I'm 25 with a rifle
You Martin Lawrence, I'm Michael Jackson Jordan and Connelly
Shit, I'm an anomaly, definitely and probably puff
The smoke out some chronic, puffin' out of leaves
Leaves ashes on my Versace and vinyl sheets
Here's an alarm clock for sleeping on Shawn
Funk flex you still owe me a bomb
Drop, I spit lava at the sun up we all hot
More fire, can't stop 'em
Can't knock 'em, I'm God I'm lost prophets
You floss, you lost profit
Boss, a don logic
I'm hard, you hardly at all so
I calmly let off
With the bar up I can let this stay on
Teach a seminar on how to seize a nigga's heartbeat
This ain't art, this is Shark Week
No it's arc meets, come on the cross seater of a Hummer
A heartbeat, life of the dark streets
A cypher at Rock Creek, park on concrete
Heart with long reach, scar, that's all gs
Real niggas acknowledge me
Bitch niggas possibly in pursuit of my property
Property, I'm talking properties
Snot nosed at the dice game, no Monopoly
Rather, Bart Simpson or Homer still on my Odyssey
Uh, peep the philosophy
Deeper than Socrates
Wisdom and knowledge leak from my noggin
I gotta read, never follow
Hoes we let 'em swallow
Twist the dro go slow, blow us at the yard go!
This is rapping for real, nigga
Like Papoose when he was actually ill
A$AP if he trill, you're now rockin' with the letter F
The flyest from JFK to LAX
It's the West
Coast, mother fucka

El Chapo, nigga
El Chapo, baby
Chap, Chap, El Chapo, baby

Oh what a killin'
Oh what a villain[Intro]
They say everything you go through in life makes life worth living
But if the world should end tomorrow...
I often think about that sometimes, know what I'm saying?

[VERSE 1]
I'll take the pain and the strife
I know it's not in vain
And struggle relate to everything in this life
I'm maintaining became a beam of light for the youth in the streets
Intertwining with goons never complaining cuz its all written
Don't be bitter we all sinners
Lusting for the good life, some hearts cold as December
Hiding behind stripes and stars Father forgive um
Earth out of her mind look what she had to witness
I talk to her at times she tell me what's on her heart
I tell her what's on my mind
Momma where do I start?
Why everybody divided?
Why people afraid to die?
She told me "talk to ya Father, he's in the sky."

[VERSE 2]
Father why everybody complaining bout what they got?
Ungrateful, they don't see what you gave um?
Make a lump sum of money start to thinking they made it
He said if you pay attention to the weather I'm jaded
It could be mid July and I feel like raining
Any day of the year I shed a tear Poppa amazing
One drop could flood the block there's no one greater
And that's why I live in the sky
No lie, I'm fly, defy gravity, I reply damn
It's like you only show yourself to the wise
I know why you won't let me come home
Left me here on my own cuz I ain't doing my job so you just letting me roam
He responded "correct" go home to my mom I'm vexed
She the reason for my drama and stress, you seem to love her
Remember though, she the present but I'm forever
Won't be long till you see us together I replied until than...

[Hook]
Now if the world should end tomorrow, Lord have mercy on me
And if the sky should fall and the walls come tumbling down, tumbling down

Now if the world should end tomorrow, Lord have mercy on me
And if the sky should fall and the walls come tumbling down, tumbling down
Then that's what its gonna be
Then that's what its gonna be[Hook-Talib Kweli sample x4]
"Livin' my life, expressin' my liberty
It gotta be done properly" "done properly"

[Verse 1]
My patterns is unmatched
I leave MC's hunchbacked with one rap
Guaranteed no comeback
I run laps around 'em, roll like Dunlap tires
Made a lot of niggas retire, I be ya highness
Sucka MC's might as well call me a sire
Just shootin' the breeze
Fuck a plane, I take you higher
This is rap for my niggas that pack, push packs
To the citizens, fakin' no jax and we militant
Straight up out the trenches
Young black and gifted
Slung sacks ridiculous, done that, you kiddin'?
160, but with a pen, I feel brolic
I can still knowledge, bang out hits like Phil Collins
Duck tail with the Starter cap, way before the rap
I was pullin' ho's, kickin' verses off the dome
Now I'm movin' up, I can't even front
Should be in the pen for all the shit I done did
But I'm livin' my life

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yeah, you are now about the witness the strength of street knowledge
Give it to 'em
Knowledge increase it, college enroll
Captivity, leave it, keep dreamin', goals
Power, money, spend it with control
God, life, mind, body and soul
Reach one, teach one, young to the old
History's a mystery and lies were sold
Poverty, reality, luxury homes
Bentley, Ferrari, Jaguar, Rolls
Royce's, racism, royalty, gold
Conflict diamonds, the world is cold
Niggas, bitches, freedom, senses
CPS infants, the future, the children
Addiction, supplements, hustlin', pimpin'
Fame, jealousy, pain, redemption
Politics, bullshit, ignorant content
Conscious nonsense, the mind is complex
Progress, the president, the people, the projects
Progress, the president, the people, the projects

[Hook][Verse 1: Planet Asia]
Fuck rappers, ban 'em like flavored Dutch Masters
Your cuts after I listen to 'em with much laughter
Champagne slush my campaign Krush
Grooving, powder Peruvian, black Nubian manoeuver
I'm like Max Julien to Cougars, with more racks than Hooters
Wasn't for rap I'd probably be head of the pack
Pass the straps to shooters
Pockets lacking Gouda, that's when niggas pack the Ruger
I caught a cool run, my crew runs shit, Hilltop Hustling logic
Rock your pillbox, I still got a couple of projects
Niggas can't fuck with my accomplishments
The Don is supreme sonic, Ebonic, speaking in phonics
Reminiscing on hand to hand, running from big knots
Now it's G&Gs all over my silk top
Amongst trappers, in the cuts we clutch clappers
Ain't another nigga die for nigga, fuck rappers
[Verse 2: Willie The Kid]
Fuck rappers, niggas 'posed to been dead
Bled through the Band-Aid, I'm Pinhead
Hell raising, I lay blades Clive Barker and Wes Craven
My neck's craving, I savor the flavor
It's savoir faire save my fear for the saviour
For all the rest of y'all I got a bomb, Jaeger
Especially you rappers, fuck all of y'all
Fast forward then backwards, sick chiropractor
I'm hot like the sand out in Cairo, a pyro
Maniac, a klepto, braniac I'm zany
Pop it like a Xanie, declare war, Cheney
My ho is like Claire Huxtable, hard lustable
All these rap niggas gassed up, combustible
Feminine internet niggas, fucking weirdos
Me and Planet Asia like Albert Anastasia
But we Asiatic, original fabric
Never fabricated, ain't got it, never had it
Used to play ball now you want to be a rapper

[Verse 3: Fashawn]
You know what, fuck rappers
We puff puff past 'em, turn niggas to blunt ashes
Consider me retro and vintage
I'm blowing dro out in Venice
A role model and my role is simple
That's captivate your soul and control your mental
Teach you how to hold a pistol
Go to Nobu and order the whole menu
Glow like I wrote it with a solid gold pencil
G shit, cause thorough is how I keep it
Niggas know, every block every borough, it ain't a secret
Flow rare like the first hair on a Mona Lisa
Check your intellect cause you're in front of a teacher
I roll the kind of reefer that'll give you amnesia
Don't believe it well roll up a gram and have a damn seizure
