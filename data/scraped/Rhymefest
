[Intro]
I am a god
I am a god
I am a god

[Hook]
I am a god
Hurry up with my damn massage
Hurry up with my damn ménage
Get the Porsche out the damn garage
I am a god
Even though I'm a man of God
My whole life in the hand of God
So y'all better quit playin' with God

[Verse 1]
Soon as they like you make 'em unlike you
Cause kissin' people ass is so unlike you
The only rapper compared to Michael
So here's a few hatin'-ass niggas to fight you
And here's a few snake-ass niggas to bite you
And I don't even wanna hear 'bout what niggas might do
Old niggas mentally still in high school
Since the tight jeans they ain't never liked you
Pink-ass polos with a fuckin' backpack
But everybody know you brought real rap back
Nobody had swag, man, we the Rat Pack
Virgil, Pyrex, Don C snapback
Ibn diamond, Chi-town shinin'
Monop' in this bitch again, changed the climate
Hop in this bitch again, same thing I'm in
Until the day I get struck by lightning

[Hook]
I am a god
So hurry up with my damn massage
In a French-ass restaurant
Hurry up with my damn croissants
I am a god
I am a god
I am a god

AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!

[Verse 2]
I just talked to Jesus
He said, "What up, Yeezus?"
I said, "Shit I'm chillin'
Tryna stack these millions"
I know he the most high
But I am a close high
Mi casa, su casa
That's our cosa nostra
I am a god
I am a god
I am a god

AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!

Ain't no way I'm givin' up. I'm a god[Produced by Kanye West, Hudson Mohawke, The Twilite Tone, Anthony Kilhoffer, Mannie Fresh & Lifted]

[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]
The storm is on the horizon
I’m standing here alone
Got a pistol on my hip and it's gonna be some shit
If you want it then bring it on
See I'm a motherfuckin' soldier
And I’mma be here 'til it’s done
And when they asking who I'm is, shit
You just tell them that I’m the one
(One, one, one)
Tell them that I’m the one
(One, one, one)
Tell them that I’m the one

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I'm the one, baby, yeah, I'm the one, baby
Since God gave his only begotten son, baby
It's hard preachin' the gospel to the slums lately
So I had to put the church on the drums, baby
You on a run, baby, you on a run, baby
You think you free but you a slave to the funds, baby
You think you me, but you ain't me, what you done lately?
Mhm that's cool but I been runnin on the sun, baby
We on a galaxy the haters cannot visit
That's my reality so get off my Scott Disick
If you ever held a title belt, you would know how Michael felt
Tyson, Jackson, Jordan - Michael Phelps
Yeahhh, had to take it to another realm
Cause everything around me got me underwhelmed
Best way to describe my position is at the helm
Best way to describe my new whip - Yeeeaaaalmmp

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I told Detroit I'mma fuckin' get it
I told my brother we'll be fuckin' winnin'
Ye told me I'm the man for the job
So I told my mom, call her's up and tell 'em that she quittin'
Started off in that Chevrolet, but it's Ferraris I gotta drive
I'm on HBO with my entourage, I'm 5'9'' fuckin' 9 to 5
I need a hundred million no compromise, I'm a double X-L nigga
Magazine and condom size, see what I seen and be traumatized
I don't wait, I marinate, variate, everyday
Every state, sold out, fuck around and need a barricade
My weed loud, I need a hearing aid
Livin' life behind a pair of shades
I be a billionaire if I could get a dollar
For all the bullshit that I hear a day
I did it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Treat the back seat like a sofa bed
Break bread with my niggas, call it profit sharing
This some good shit, but it get better
And yeah my bitch cold, nigga thin sweater
Like my verse suede and the beat leather
Just tryin' to stay above sea level
When my nigga went to jail, I said, "Free Gucci"
I done bought so much shit, I should get free Gucci
Bought my baby momma anaconda bags
I shouldn't have bought it all, I should've went and cut the grass
Snake ass niggas in my fuckin' face
Bring your girl here nigga so I could fuck her face
Yeah I run this place, this is cashmere swag
Niggas treadmillin' goin' nowhere fast
Sittin' courtside at the Hawks game
Louis on, I could trip a fuckin' ball player

[Outro x2: James Fauntleroy]
Fuck yeah, awesome, yeah I lost some, of my mind
And then I found peace, it was really kind of awesome
It's possible, goddamn right
I've been honest the whole time[Intro: R. Kelly]
Let me see you put your middle fingers up
To the world, I made up in my mind
I'm doin' things my way, I'm burnin' shit down tonight
I'm doin' things my way, it's my way or the highway
Let me say it one more time
Middle fingers up to the world, to the world, to the world
To the world, to the world, to the world
Let me see you put your middle fingers up
Middle fingers up!

[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
(Motherfucker) Deuces minus one
Middle finger to the sky tonight (Ay, ay, ay)
The whole world is a couch
Bitch I'm Rick James tonight (I don't give a fuck)
Throw it up, throw it up cause you can't take it with you
Funny how they wait 'til you gone just to miss you
To the world, to the world then I'm on my Sinatra
I'm doing it my way, let's take it a notch up
Take it up

[Hook: R. Kelly]
Let me see you put your middle fingers up!
To the world, I made up in my mind
Doing things my way, I'm burning shit down tonight
I'm doing things my way, it's my way or the highway
Let me say it one more time
Middle fingers up to the world, to the world, to the world

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Mmm ain't this some shit? Pulled up in the A-V-entador
And the doors, raise up, like praise the Lord
Did the fashion show, and a tour, and a movie, and a score
This a ghetto opera, Francis Foreign Car Coppola
I need a new crib to hold my plaques, Rick Ross'd told me that
Said I'd be all up in Goldman Sachs like, "These niggas tryna hold me back
These niggas tryna hold me back", I'm just trying to protect my stacks
Mitt Romney, don't pay no tax, Mitt Romney, don't pay no tax
Chi-Town 'til I'm on my back, Chi-Town 'til I'm on my back
Only nigga in Beverly Hills, where the hell is Axel Foley at?
"Ease up there, baby boy": Ving Rhames told Jody that
R. Kelly and the God of rap, shitting on you, holy crap

[Hook: R. Kelly]
Let me see you put your middle fingers up
To the world, to the world, to the world
To the world, to the world, to the world
Let me see you put your middle fingers up

[Outro: Teyana Taylor]
I could give it all up, but it's not enough
Ay ay, here you go, my middle finger
To the world, to the world, from the ground to the moon
Hills to the mountains, yeah, hands to the roof
Give it up, give it up, won't let you deny me
Makin' you love me, makin' you love me[Intro]
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new

[Hook: Rhymefest & Kanye]
I don't like it unless it's (brand new)
You might see me in my (brand new) whip
With my (brand new) bitch, pumpin' my (brand new) shit
You don't like it, get off my (brand new) dick, nigga
(Repeat x2)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker, fly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't, because you love what I make
Now ain't that about a bitch
And I'mma talk shit until I'm out of hits
They don't want to turn they speakers up, they claim I ain't deep enough
All that talkin' I feed off of, keep it up
I'm relaxin', my feet is up
I'm leavin' you haters like when Shaq left the Lakers just to Heat it up
I state the stats to stunt, I don't need to front
Make black history every day, I don't need a month
The survey says, by the streets according
Kanye's just important as Michael Jordan
Was to the NBA when he was scorin'
Ralph Lauren was borin' before I wore him and

[Hook: Kanye West & Rhymefest]

[Verse 2: Rhymefest]
Now some women hit the mall and some shop at the thrift store
Some of 'em mix and match to make it look like they get more
Some of y'all know you wear a sixteen, squeezin' into a six
Damn, what you make them jeans rip for?
I guess she's lookin' for a (brand new) man who
Ain't always gotta sit down cause he can't stand you
Boo, this the (brand new) jam to dance to
While you givin' me head like shampoo, come as you came
Skip the (brand) name, I won't (brand) you
What you do here stay here like Cancun
Besides your breasts is augmented, I like things authentic
Look at all my whips, they're all vintage
I got a loft with a view of the sea
See I take some old shit and make it (new) for me
Pimp it out like Xzibit to the (oomph) degree
Why spend and arm and a leg, we can kick it for free you see

[Hook: Rhymefest & Kanye]

[Verse 3: Rhymefest]
Now Che bustin' and then hit 'em, fuck the cynicism
I'm quick to give y'all niggas constructive criticism
Like "Wait, you basically suck," his mother said "My son wanna rhyme!"
I'm like Ma'am, I don't agree with that decision
Nothin' against him, but if he step I gotta diss him
I listen to that weak shit, all of it, I can't follow it
(vomit) Excuse me, I'm wack-tose intolerant
"I worked too hard to get my baby baller kit!"
Nine to fives, had me blue collar poppin' it
Now I'm in the club, and look who I get it poppin' with
Me and 'Ye go back like crew cuts
He hook me up, as long as I don't ask him for too much
But even he know 'Fest is layin' it down
Cause this is just an old beat he had layin' around

[Hook: Kanye & Rhymefest][Kanye West]
("Make It Up") We can make it better
("Make It Up") We can make it better
("Make It Up") We can make it better
("Make It Up") We can make it

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Somebody told me that Delta's brownskinned, AKAs' lightskinned
And they supposed to be bougious, so they got white friends
First day of school, I'mma take you sight seein'
Show you what we do on weekends for excitement
She said, "I know what you about to say, like your hypeman"
Last year a nigga hit her, and now she only date white men
And if a nigga even wave at her, it's frightnin' but

[Hook: Kanye West]
("Make It Up") We can make it better
(Better we can)
("Make It Up") We can make it better
(Better we can make it on up, we can)
("Make It Up") We can make it better
(Better we can)
("Make It Up") We can make it

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
The night fallin' over Brooklyn, where they murder for change
The converter remains faithful to the drugdealer priestess
He in search of the word of fame, you heard of the name
Kweli the truth, like I'm comin' out the mouths of babes
One foot in, one foot out the grave
Niggas want they reperations, How you calculate the amount to be paid
You try to imagine America without the slaves (the slaves)

[Hook: Kanye West]

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
Her tenament yo, is rat infested
Her heart is like a gold bullion cause she went and protested
Cause, her bestfriend's man got popped
He was sixteen years old, the cop thought his phone was a Glock
In the hood is a everday happenin'
In front of the precinct she chews out the captain
She yelled out "Why you do this to black men?"

[Hook: Kanye West]

[Verse 4: Common]
I think of eighty seven ways, to make better days
Whether crime or rhyme, I heard the rebel pays
On the scene, tryin' to get green like everglades
The music, ridin' it good like the Escalades
In the ghetto infested by shade and drama
And niggas wit' thangs ain't afraid of karma
I'm thinkin' big like Lil Wayne in The Carter

[Hook: Kanye West]

[Verse 5: Rhymefest]
C'mon; Tell people the truth, but never give 'em ya true thoughts
Terrorism on blacks, they poison our Newports
Partiot Act in effect, make it hard to breathe now
Johnnie Cochran dead, who gonna get us us free now?
Clinton ain't in office, who gon' give us shit free now?
Who gon' make it better for the thugs in the penal?
Who gon' make it good for old folks that's senile?
Oh, it's good music, yeah dog I see now

[Hook: Kanye West][Rhymefest]
Straight outta highschool he didn't know what to do
Wanted to go to college but no money was nothing new
Wanted to get away go see the world and do something new
He got approached in the mall by the army recruit
Told him "If you wanna go to school we got money too
Sign up at eighteen you be out when you twenty-two"
He joined the army airborne
Got his uniform went to bootcamp got some discipline
Iraq is where they shipped him
He's in the middle of bullets flyin' and missin him
Wishing he was a kid again with his family in Michigan
In the midst of fighting militiamen, one round took down six of them
He ain't really a killer though, taking a lot of risks
This is what a poor person do for a scholarship
He turned around and got a face full of hollow-tips
But don't be mad, he died for the flag

[Hook: Citizen Cope]
Now what you've done here, is put yourself between a bullet and a target
And it won't be long before, you're pullin' yourself away
What you've done here, is put yourself between a bullet and a target
And it won't be long before, you're pullin' yourself away

[Rhymefest]
Papa was a playa, knew just what to say ta'
Get the women back to his lair, and lay her
If sex had a trophy he's the Heisman, touchdown
Hitting models and R&B chicks and bust-downs
He got the women with crazy stares with his lady there
Thay ain't care they like "Ooh look at his baby hair"
He took 'em all put 'em in a line hit five new chickens
He thought they were fine
Got head from five dope-fiends smoking a dime
And did it all raw dog, and dawg I ain't lyin
Til' he woke up one season with lesions
He went to the doctor asked him what was the reason
The test read positive he couldn't believe it
He tried to blame God asking why did he leave him
Pleading please let the disease leave him
From women that he conquered, he caught the monster

[Hook]

[Rhymefest]
Now when the sun goes down, on our side of town
On the other side of the block, when cops ain't around
On the same side of the street that 'Pac hit the ground
Not in Vegas, cause every nigga got 'Pac in him now
When my guys hit the block, and we proving we thugs
I ain't on no swim team but you see pools of blood
Skip Judy when you die, she ain't whose the judge
Oh you married to game then prove your love
Here's a strap shorty, shoot it do it just do it
This ain't a gang this a organized movement
My hurt, my love, my pain, my stress
My strife, my wife, my life, my test
We made for more, we die for less
When you starving in the ghetto I'mma right the rest
See my girl think I'm hard, and my Momma think I'm hard
But when I'm all up in the dark I just fall on my knees

[Hook][Intro]
Dear Ol' Dirty Bastard, no no
Dear, Baby Jesus, no that's not it
Dear Dirt McGirt, aw yeah yeah yeah
Look, man it's this girl that I really like man
And, I want to get her to notice me
So, I just wanted some advice on
What should I do to like, get her to come my way
Write back soon, your biggest fan, Rhymefest

[Hook: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Why do you build me up (build me up) buttercup
Baby just to let me down (just to let me down)
Mess me around, and then worst of all (worst of all)
You never call baby when you say you will (when you say you will)
But I love you still, I need you! (I need you!)
More than anyone darlin; you know that I have from the start
Build me up (build me up)
Buttercup, don't break my heart

[Rhymefest]
Look, c'mon
Have you ever met a girl, come into your world
Cracked the safe, put your brain on sterile
Activate and leave stains like curls
Sophisticate, and make you feel so world
Ahhh, there it is - so liberated
Ridin in a sports car, so ventilated
Joggin in a sports bra, so titillated
Chick so Hood, but not refrigerated
Look McGirt, I don't wanna trouble ya
But this chick on my block, I'm in love with her
I wanna get up in her Bush like Dubya
Tryin to get up in her Bush like Dubya
So write me back, let me know
How I'm 'sposed to hit it when I got no dough
How I'm 'sposed to spit it when I got no flow
Shimmy shimmy yay, shimmy ya, shimmy yo
Oh (woo-hoo-hoooo)

[Hook]

[Rhymefest]
I just wanna talk to her
But I'm me and this girl is so popular
Mr. Dirty gave me his binoculars
From a distance I just started watchin her
Then I met her at Hills on the Southside
Bought her chicken and fries, with coleslaw side
She ain't say thanks enough, that's all pride
I don't care about her manners, I just let it slide
I just think about fuckin you everyday
And just sink in the back of my Chevrolet
All that chicken you ate and you never paid
Take my order, can I have a breast or leg?
Would you fin' to say no, oh, how's that so?
After I came here and spent all my dough?
"Look boy it's chicken, what is you broke?"
Then I got scared and said it's a joke
Gave her a hug and stole her a Coke

[Hook]

[Rhymefest]
Dear Dirty, thanks for the advice and everything man
It didn't really work out with this chick this time
She wasn't that buttercup, she was just another slut man
But you know what? I'm just gonna say forget about it man
I'mma go get a movie, you haven't seen "Harry Met Sally" yet?
It's kinda like what I'm goin through; aww, whatever
C'mon!

Yeah
This is for everybody lookin for that perfect girl man
Sometimes you ain't got all the money in the world
And you ain't got all the looks in the world but
You can still find that buttercup
Don't let her build you up and break you down man
You build it up, whatever, yo freak for me
Make sure she like to fuck though, heh
That's always important isn't it?

[ODB] Expect you're the one for meeeeeeeeeee
[Fest] Yo Dirt, pack your bags, let's go
[ODB] Girrrrl, the way you give brains to meeeeeeeeeee
[Fest] Yo Dirt, it's over G![Rhymefest]
{"And everything's gonna work out fine"}
I don't know man {"Ohhh Lord"} not the way things is lookin
Look, let me tell y'all somethin
Women, they do the same thing that men do man
They cheat, they go out, they wild, they girls goin wild
But they a lil' better at it than we at!
See they plan it out man
And and if you don't understand how the game works
You know what? I think it's time for me to break it down to ya
Let me tell you my story

Now your sister lyin for you when I walk in the house
She like, "Oh you just walked in, she just stepped out!"
What I'm two seconds behind you, take detectives to find you
Let me just, remind you, who the hell you lyin to
Said that you was goin out with Claire
I called Claire (*Hello?*) she was at home, you wasn't there
I'm like ahh hell naw, dawg she wouldn't dare
Dare she did, went to the club, there she is
That's my word, I started thinkin all absurd
I started listenin to Tank like {"Maybe I Deserve"}
Yeah yeah I cheated once, twice, maybe three
But hey, that ain't the point, we ain't talkin 'bout me
Don't change subjects and claim you love 'Fest
When every other day I don't know who you gon' fuck next
I'm thinkin you my girl, my lady, my boo
Tell me admit nothin, we can work this through - psych!

[Hook: Mario] + (Rhymefest)
Are we, really sure (yeah, yeah)
That a love that's lasted for so long can still endure
(Can it still endure?)
Do I, really care (yeah, yeah) la-da-da-da-DAH-DAH-DAH
Hey hey I'm talkin 'bout distractions, goin on elsewhere

[Rhymefest]
Oh you don't think you need game, homey you better have it
Cause women cheat like men, only they better at it
You kiss your girl on the cheek, thinkin she sweet
She got a man to meet at least for every day of the week
Monday - she with Larry, he think he slicker than hair grease
Big daddy with a Caddy and he rockin his hair piece
He like to show off, he's spendin the bucks
But she ain't even gotta fuck him cause he cain't get it up
Tuesday - she with Claude, he on some treat her like a lady shit
Chivalrous, pull the chair out and he's always there to babysit
So - Wednesday and Thursday - she can go out and dance
And if she met me, she probably had a one night stand
Friday - she back wit'chu, kissin and cuddlin
Talkin 'bout her hard week and lookin for love again
Now I ain't tryin to tell you that you wrong for keepin her
All I'm tryin to say is you don't own her, you leasin her

[Hook: Mario] + (Rhymefest)
Are we, really sure (uhh, c'mon)
That a love that's lasted for so long can still endure
(Can it still endure?)
Do I, really care (I don't know) Hey hey hey
I'm talkin 'bout distractions, goin on elsewhere

[Rhymefest]
Look I'mma sing it one mo' time - man, don't get distracted
Your woman cheat like you, only she better at it
She come up with the plan befo'hand, befo' you even ask
"Where was yo' ass?" She tell you where she been and then
Give you a hug, backrub, run the water for the tub
By now, you done forgot she was a thug?
Wait, you need some help stud
Yo' girl wearin perfume and spandex like
I'm goin to the health club with Sheryl
(You know Sheryl!) Yeah you know Sheryl
With two baby daddies, one for her and one for yo' girl
And the whole world knows, but they cain't convince him
That's his baby momma and he's so defensive
She ride around in the Benz and spend them ends up
Took me to the mall, I was so expensive!
I ain't tryin to tell you not to give her your best
But you might wanna still have a paternity test

[Hook: Mario] + (Rhymefest)
Are we, really sure (are we really sure)
That a love that's lasted for so long can still endure
(Can it still endure?)
Do I, really care, hey hey hey
I'm talkin 'bout distractions, goin on elsewhere

[Mario]
Talkin 'bout it goin on elsewhere
Cause there's so many girls, around the world
Goin on elsewhere, goin on elsewhere
Cause there's so many girls, around the world
Goin on elsewhere, goin on elsewhere
Hey hey hey HEYYYY![Rhymefest]
Mr. Blue Collar, yeah... you know what?
It's time for me to give a testament to where I came from
The streets of Chicago, Southside
Yeah, Mr. Blue Collar
I gotta do it like this

You can take the boy outta slum, can't take slum outta son
I should be lynched, I'm so high-strung
At 15 my mother tried to have me aborted
You gotta kill us both doc, I'm not the only one
It's a package deal, comin up like a pack of rats
Fightin over scraps, the streets is ill
Take a trip to the city of wind, the city of sin
My block'll have you born again
But it ain't like church, life hurts
Drug raids, she stuffin rocks down her baby's diapers
It go the other way too when your mother's on hype
And you gotta serve her blow 'fore you go to school
So I spit like a fool to the chorus
Military jail time all they got for us
I seen how they deal every Hoover and Jeff Fort (how?)
Lock up all our leaders, let the ghetto eat us
I'm the ghetto Regis, in Che-vy Caprices
And niggas that front can get blown to little pieces
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you know why? Cause it's

[Hook]
All I do - workin hard for scratch
Talk shit get your jaw detached
All I do - though I'm still in the streets a bit
A brother ain't fin' to take no shit
All I do - lil' buddy, this could get ugly
Trust me, cause this is
All I do - before I explode, I give you my ode
In the summer, rain, fall or cold

[Rhymefest]
Spittin bars is felt to carve wealth
And stay hungry to the death I will starve my-self
To keep what I got and have what I want
And stay real them my niggas knowin half of 'em don't got
The gift to ball, a rhymers fit
Thought we still want the finest shit (all I do)
Is take whitey's bread, keep a nice spread
Hit the club and try to leave without bustin no heads
I don't care about a deal, I've been poor all my life
Cocksucker I ain't afraid of how the shit feel
Sit still, soak the moment in
You got somethin bad to say, nigga hold it in
You afraid to die? You ain't a soldier then
Chi-Town stand up, we supposed to win
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you know why? Cause it's

[Hook]

[Rhymefest]
This for my people locked up for pushin diesel
Deliver us from this evil God (all I do)
Or gettin home from the gig and got a gang full of kids
You feel the stress like (all I do)
Setbacks, yeah you gotta expect that
Get back and grind nigga (all I do)
Now you can let yourself breathe
Throw yo' hands in the air and release say (all I do)

Mr. Blue Collar[ INTRO: JUICE ]
Ey
I swear there's nobody in the industry fuckin with Chicago rap niggas
Believe me
I give it to you niggas if you want it
This for you, Va
What up, P

[ VERSE 1: JUICE ]
I'm the grimiest nigga
With the weapon I'm smackin ya
A Legend like Acura
Plus I'm ryhmin with vigor
With a better work ethic they say I mighta been Jigga
There's no regrets, the flow is wet, my nigga, cry me a river
Exceptional vernacular, weapons spectacular
And I'm never satisfied, somebody grab me a Snicker
Named J-U-ICE like the diamonds that glitter
When rhymin in a blizzard, seein me's like tryina get a lining with scissors
Plus I'm throwin back a fifth of that Dom, my nigga, it's fryin my liver
Supplyin the piff and ? infinite
I don't even gotta try to get ignorant
Like Theo and Vanessa dad I can deliver it
Plus I do it just to brag, I am a intricate rhymin wizard
Intravenous dope up in every rhyme and I'm spittin it
It's like I'm puttin coke in every line and you sniffin it
Plus I carry a nine, Terry Shine, I'm rippin it

[ VERSE 2: Rhymefest ]
I am not here to spit metaphors or create dances
I am a can of whoop-ass ready to open
Willin and hopin you would provoke him
Try to insult me, I will punch you in yo face until my fists start smokin
Till my hands start soakin in the blood from the wounds that was open
From the shit you was talkin out of motion
I'm emotionless, I beat you to a Pulp for yo Fictional
Some old John Travolta shit, hocus pocus, bitch
It's the magic show, spooks disappear down the rabbit hole
LJ guerilla warfare, my shit's tactical
I hold grudges, ? , do not touch it
Fuck with, walk away from me, man, say "Fuck it"
You don't want it, get stomped by the Brown Hornets
Vakill, Crooked I and J, we all on it
Keep your friends close, your enemies closer
Fuck that, kill your enemies, yo, this ain't Oprah
We gon' ride

[ VERSE 3: Nino Bless ]
Look I don't give a fuck, my motto is live it up
Keep your glass half full, see mines, I fill up
You want war, please give it up, the gig is up
I'm sick enough to penetrate ?
Yes it's Brooklyn's crooked minister
Spit conscious shit, then push some kush when I finish up
I administer the sickest of scripts since
That Indian that wrote the script to the Sixth Sense
You lames spittin should quit and go back to 'caine, bitches
Is you insane, you must ? simpin
Got your blood on my blade drippin, I ain't kiddin
I pierce your chest like a ? , you lay stiffen
Dog, I stay trippin, you know I was playin, pimpin
I end his life cause this wasn't in G and Kane's vision
Yeah I'm game uptown for that same mission
Aim-clickin, bang-spittin, flame sick as Twain's diction

[ VERSE 4: Crooked I ]
Yeah, even though I'm holdin hot burners
This killer is colder than hyperthermia
A single round spin'll sit you down like a hernia
Me and Rihanna, we got a seperate definition for 'disturbia'
I'm mentaly disturbed, nigga, I murder ya
That prrrat put a peephole in your flesh
A keyhole in your chest
Then I open up your torso
Just like a door, so
Death can walk in
Negro, I'm depressed, please know I'm a mess
Send you right upstairs
Gun treat you like them Billie Jean sidewalks, the way they light up squares
Yeah, kill kickdrums, tie up snares
Wanna describe my flow in one word? Try 'unfair'
Tireless nights I spit fire into wireless mics
Till I expired its life, until my life expired I'm fly as a kite
And I'm firin iron that'll turn any Iron Mike into Brian McKnight
Mmmwwaaa, good night

[ VERSE 5: Vakill ]
I'm hate's Cupid on a poison-tipped arrow assignment
Strapped to the ?
My barrel alignments never minded enough exposin bone-marrow confinement
Non-rhymers' subsconcious is vicious
Only pussy gettin past these bars is conjugal visits
Ganja exquisit, when inhaled conjure a vision
Explicit as point blank with a rocket launcher ?
My physic's the Lord's best kept secret, swept under His rug
Cracked the earth with a thunderous tug
I work wonders with slugs, I'm a blunder with blood
It will spill until the angels come and plunge in the flood
?
This that new Chi, necks frosty, bars is Windex-glossy
Next costly mistake I'm squeezin Tecs ?
Any nigga that plans to ex-off me
Ain't got two snowballs chances on a anatomically correct Frosty
You ain't heard no bars that's inhuman and wild
Mushroomin a cloud till all you bitches consumed in a pile
God and Satan reunion is now
And if Obama gets shot there'll be more blood in crackers than fuckin communion allows
Can't shit breathin dishonour these verses
Only cracks you'll find in my arm is 2 for 5's if the fuckin economy worsens[Verse 1: Rhymefest]
Bounce my nigga
You dont want no beef with these Chi-town niggas
You ain't got the phlegm for the four pound spitters
Underground underneath everything that glitters
Still gold, still selling 500 thousand
Not satisfied till we push another thousand
Park the vehicle right in front of public housing
So the shorties with nigga half
?????
Run a little math and
Count that paper
???
Bounce back later
Have green parties but not Ralph Nader
Black like Darth Vader
You know me, ain’t squeeze, talk later
“That’s my baby”
What my mama say when I got her that Mercedes
Make that old woman feel like a young lady
That’s crazy
I went from broke as a yoke to no jokin homie just ???

[Hook: “Can't Give You Anything (But My Love)” by The Stylistics]
If I had money I'd go out
Buy you furs, dress you like a queen
And in a chauffeured limousine
We'd look so fine
But I'm an ordinary guy
And my pockets are empty

[Verse 2: Rhymefest]
You want to know what the Midwest is?
Wild and restless where reckless niggas might snap ya necklace
And next them niggas might jack ya Lexus
Whole blocks fighting over blocks like Tetris
That’s so foolish
We finna flip the rocks and stocks ???
Buy everybody computers
Every ride is the newest, every chick be the nudest
Doin’ it for ourselves
Ya'll know how them crackers do it
So you bounce my nigga
??
Like we smoke an ounce my nigga
???
We about to flip the game
Equip the ??
Buy three houses
And we decorate our cribs the same
So take that witcha
Starving artists naw man
Paint that picture
??? Got my film
Can't get richer
Standin’ by me
Without a deal
Making this mil

[Hook x2][Intro]
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new

[Hook: Rhymefest & Kanye]
I don't like it unless it's (brand new)
You might see me in my (brand new) whip
With my (brand new) bitch, pumpin' my (brand new) shit
You don't like it, get off my (brand new) dick, nigga
(Repeat x2)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker, fly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't, because you love what I make
Now ain't that about a bitch
And I'mma talk shit until I'm out of hits
They don't want to turn they speakers up, they claim I ain't deep enough
All that talkin' I feed off of, keep it up
I'm relaxin', my feet is up
I'm leavin' you haters like when Shaq left the Lakers just to Heat it up
I state the stats to stunt, I don't need to front
Make black history every day, I don't need a month
The survey says, by the streets according
Kanye's just important as Michael Jordan
Was to the NBA when he was scorin'
Ralph Lauren was borin' before I wore him and

[Hook: Kanye West & Rhymefest]

[Verse 2: Rhymefest]
Now some women hit the mall and some shop at the thrift store
Some of 'em mix and match to make it look like they get more
Some of y'all know you wear a sixteen, squeezin' into a six
Damn, what you make them jeans rip for?
I guess she's lookin' for a (brand new) man who
Ain't always gotta sit down cause he can't stand you
Boo, this the (brand new) jam to dance to
While you givin' me head like shampoo, come as you came
Skip the (brand) name, I won't (brand) you
What you do here stay here like Cancun
Besides your breasts is augmented, I like things authentic
Look at all my whips, they're all vintage
I got a loft with a view of the sea
See I take some old shit and make it (new) for me
Pimp it out like Xzibit to the (oomph) degree
Why spend and arm and a leg, we can kick it for free you see

[Hook: Rhymefest & Kanye]

[Verse 3: Rhymefest]
Now Che bustin' and then hit 'em, fuck the cynicism
I'm quick to give y'all niggas constructive criticism
Like "Wait, you basically suck," his mother said "My son wanna rhyme!"
I'm like Ma'am, I don't agree with that decision
Nothin' against him, but if he step I gotta diss him
I listen to that weak shit, all of it, I can't follow it
(vomit) Excuse me, I'm wack-tose intolerant
"I worked too hard to get my baby baller kit!"
Nine to fives, had me blue collar poppin' it
Now I'm in the club, and look who I get it poppin' with
Me and 'Ye go back like crew cuts
He hook me up, as long as I don't ask him for too much
But even he know 'Fest is layin' it down
Cause this is just an old beat he had layin' around

[Hook: Kanye & Rhymefest][Intro]
Dear Ol' Dirty Bastard, no no
Dear, Baby Jesus, no that's not it
Dear Dirt McGirt, aw yeah yeah yeah
Look, man it's this girl that I really like man
And, I want to get her to notice me
So, I just wanted some advice on
What should I do to like, get her to come my way
Write back soon, your biggest fan, Rhymefest

[Hook: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Why do you build me up (build me up) buttercup
Baby just to let me down (just to let me down)
Mess me around, and then worst of all (worst of all)
You never call baby when you say you will (when you say you will)
But I love you still, I need you! (I need you!)
More than anyone darlin; you know that I have from the start
Build me up (build me up)
Buttercup, don't break my heart

[Rhymefest]
Look, c'mon
Have you ever met a girl, come into your world
Cracked the safe, put your brain on sterile
Activate and leave stains like curls
Sophisticate, and make you feel so world
Ahhh, there it is - so liberated
Ridin in a sports car, so ventilated
Joggin in a sports bra, so titillated
Chick so Hood, but not refrigerated
Look McGirt, I don't wanna trouble ya
But this chick on my block, I'm in love with her
I wanna get up in her Bush like Dubya
Tryin to get up in her Bush like Dubya
So write me back, let me know
How I'm 'sposed to hit it when I got no dough
How I'm 'sposed to spit it when I got no flow
Shimmy shimmy yay, shimmy ya, shimmy yo
Oh (woo-hoo-hoooo)

[Hook]

[Rhymefest]
I just wanna talk to her
But I'm me and this girl is so popular
Mr. Dirty gave me his binoculars
From a distance I just started watchin her
Then I met her at Hills on the Southside
Bought her chicken and fries, with coleslaw side
She ain't say thanks enough, that's all pride
I don't care about her manners, I just let it slide
I just think about fuckin you everyday
And just sink in the back of my Chevrolet
All that chicken you ate and you never paid
Take my order, can I have a breast or leg?
Would you fin' to say no, oh, how's that so?
After I came here and spent all my dough?
"Look boy it's chicken, what is you broke?"
Then I got scared and said it's a joke
Gave her a hug and stole her a Coke

[Hook]

[Rhymefest]
Dear Dirty, thanks for the advice and everything man
It didn't really work out with this chick this time
She wasn't that buttercup, she was just another slut man
But you know what? I'm just gonna say forget about it man
I'mma go get a movie, you haven't seen "Harry Met Sally" yet?
It's kinda like what I'm goin through; aww, whatever
C'mon!

Yeah
This is for everybody lookin for that perfect girl man
Sometimes you ain't got all the money in the world
And you ain't got all the looks in the world but
You can still find that buttercup
Don't let her build you up and break you down man
You build it up, whatever, yo freak for me
Make sure she like to fuck though, heh
That's always important isn't it?

[ODB] Expect you're the one for meeeeeeeeeee
[Fest] Yo Dirt, pack your bags, let's go
[ODB] Girrrrl, the way you give brains to meeeeeeeeeee
[Fest] Yo Dirt, it's over G![Rhymefest]
Straight outta highschool he didn't know what to do
Wanted to go to college but no money was nothing new
Wanted to get away go see the world and do something new
He got approached in the mall by the army recruit
Told him "If you wanna go to school we got money too
Sign up at eighteen you be out when you twenty-two"
He joined the army airborne
Got his uniform went to bootcamp got some discipline
Iraq is where they shipped him
He's in the middle of bullets flyin' and missin him
Wishing he was a kid again with his family in Michigan
In the midst of fighting militiamen, one round took down six of them
He ain't really a killer though, taking a lot of risks
This is what a poor person do for a scholarship
He turned around and got a face full of hollow-tips
But don't be mad, he died for the flag

[Hook: Citizen Cope]
Now what you've done here, is put yourself between a bullet and a target
And it won't be long before, you're pullin' yourself away
What you've done here, is put yourself between a bullet and a target
And it won't be long before, you're pullin' yourself away

[Rhymefest]
Papa was a playa, knew just what to say ta'
Get the women back to his lair, and lay her
If sex had a trophy he's the Heisman, touchdown
Hitting models and R&B chicks and bust-downs
He got the women with crazy stares with his lady there
Thay ain't care they like "Ooh look at his baby hair"
He took 'em all put 'em in a line hit five new chickens
He thought they were fine
Got head from five dope-fiends smoking a dime
And did it all raw dog, and dawg I ain't lyin
Til' he woke up one season with lesions
He went to the doctor asked him what was the reason
The test read positive he couldn't believe it
He tried to blame God asking why did he leave him
Pleading please let the disease leave him
From women that he conquered, he caught the monster

[Hook]

[Rhymefest]
Now when the sun goes down, on our side of town
On the other side of the block, when cops ain't around
On the same side of the street that 'Pac hit the ground
Not in Vegas, cause every nigga got 'Pac in him now
When my guys hit the block, and we proving we thugs
I ain't on no swim team but you see pools of blood
Skip Judy when you die, she ain't whose the judge
Oh you married to game then prove your love
Here's a strap shorty, shoot it do it just do it
This ain't a gang this a organized movement
My hurt, my love, my pain, my stress
My strife, my wife, my life, my test
We made for more, we die for less
When you starving in the ghetto I'mma right the rest
See my girl think I'm hard, and my Momma think I'm hard
But when I'm all up in the dark I just fall on my knees

[Hook][Hook: El]
It's so amazing
How life changes
Doing what you love
It's such a break
Special occassion
?
I spend my dues
I'm living proof
That nothing stays the same
Got to stay true
Until my time has come

[Verse 1: Rhymefest]
How you feeling?
I woke up this monrning, feeling great
Get to enjoy this day that god made
A classic
?
?
I want my 3 P's: Paper, Pussy, and Passion
I'm like a broke street light, boy I'm flashing
Got to hit the lake, crack open the Hennessy
Today, we ain't giving haters no energy
No beef, See no drama
Little kids say "see him mama, he's cool"
Let the top down, we can ride round
?
Graduation, Celebration
You just got married? Congratulations
This is a jam for any special occasion
You know how it feels? Amazing

[hook]

[Verse 2: Rhymefest]
What's the one time of your life you wanna visit?
Not to change nothing, just to re-live it
Just to feel it, The first time you ever made love
Your first car, The time you got your girl's first hug
Or would you live in the present, or go to the future and ball?
Live is a blessing, and hopefully you won't fall
Family and friends are rare, but good for us all
?
The summer, the fun we be feeling it
The woman, or weed we get higher than helium
I touch people with words, That's why they listening
They say the black man's life span
Is sixty-five
You have then, let's get it in, while we alive
?
Haters I tell them, I will survive

[hook]

[Outro: El]
A special occasion
If you're doing what you love
No one is brown man's dust tomorrow
No one, No one[Hook: Rhymefest + Mikkey]
Meet them Chicago-Rillas
Yeah..And we some cold hard killas
Meet them Chicago-Rillas
Yeah..We came to get that scrilla

[Verse 1: Mikkey]
Uh, point blank Charlie, I'm that nigga
Been killing them Kanye tracks before Jigga
Hooked with No ID when Common moved to NY
I was in the hundreds runnin' around, totin semis
Left Cash Money and started my own empire
And we don't do no bird call, bitch we been fly
And we won't kiss another man in the mouth, we GANGSTA
But we will run up in your house and stain ya
Close range murder remain ya
Empty the whole clip plus what's in the chamber
And a vest won't help you Joe you know what we aim for
Lower that ice boy you know what we came for, nigga
Act like it we gon' put you to sleep
We'll own everything worth some even your teeth
And beef, you don't want, it I promise that
This is south homicide of Chicago, honor that

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rhymefest]
You could never hold this block like I do
You grew up with a house full of women and let your momma pussify you
Started gangbangin' in high school
Got your ass whipped then you stopped gangbangin' in high school
This is something to ride to
Bitch ho wonderful
Twista, Common and Kanye look real comfortable
Bump, Fest and Mikkey finna snatch it from under you
I'll help a nigga bag dependin' on how my numbers do
Huh, and this ain't Wayne talkin' greasy, greasy
This is Jeffrey Manor-isms and they need me, need me
I'm a gremlin after 12 ho feed me, feed me
Girls we got it's too hot for TV, TV
THAT'S RIIIIGHT, naw it ain't Jeezy, Jeezy
Them Chicago-Rillas gon' snatch ya freebie
Wear it around the hood, believe me
And when you want it back the price moved up like George and Weezie
I will never snitch, I will never tell
When the heat is on, I will never bail
I will, never--let a stud extort me
I'll run up in your house with malik and we ain't fin a spit poetry
I'll put a punk head where the floor be
I'm like bullets flying through the hood, you can't ignore me BITCH

[Hook]

[Bump J:]
Yeah
My crew is thorough
I see life through a barrel
I'm clean cause I make green like blue and yellow
I got a deal, I ain't flash-you'll ball out
I went in cops with crates of guns and passed 'em all out
I'm that hood, make rappers call it quits
I've been good, Atlantic just made it all legit
It's all real, y'all rappers just act hard
And we spend money like it grows in our backyard
The Mac-11 is with me, I'm goin' well over 80
In that navy blue 760
And I'm headed towards the hundreds, the king of the city
Going to get this money (with Rhymefest and Mikkey, NIGGA)
Crossing them, you're dead wrong
I will grab that chrome
Put it on your head like some head phones
You don't want Bump to squeeze till the lead's gone
Block bloody murder, redrum (redrum, NIGGA)[Sample]:
"Comin' and goin', asleep at the wake
In bed at the hospital"

[Hook]:
Comin' and goin'
Comin' and goin'

[Verse One] [Nottz]:
See in my mind
This don' popped up a million times
Our destiny's song, weren't sung from the same lyrics
Turn it up
Hope ya niggas hear it
Over ten years gone, ain't enough to kill the spirit
Cause these dudes wanna be rap superstars
Want it spoon fed to 'em plus the hot car
But look dawg, I grind for mine dig it?
I'm a hustler homeboy I don't cry for mine
Nigga, I get it, how I get it in
Hard work got me dividends
I'm still on my grind till the name ring like Timbaland
Or Skateboard P, or Kanyeezy or
S.W.I.Z.Z. Beatz, the game need me bitch
D. Sloan right beside me
Nigga held me down way before the birth of DMP
Magneezy (what up boy?)
These dudes don't know what the grind is
So niggas stop cryin'
You can't keep...

[Scratch Hook]:
Comin' and goin'
So
Release yourself
You can't keep
Comin' and goin'
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout
Y'all cats don't know what the grind 'bout
Comin' and goin'
Ya know your boy
Stay on my grind
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout
Comin' and goin'
(El Che is comin!)

[Verse Two] [Rhymefest]
Yo, these niggas talkin' Art Of War thinkin' they can start a war
If you ain't ready for death then that's a part of war
I bring it down to The Wire like Baltimore
Come to Chi-Town shorty's is livin' through a holocaust
Look through the peephole, this can not be Tivo'd
Rewind or sped up, STOP, it's real people
I paid for college, knowledge can not be repoed
Here's my story now, when I die it can't be retold
I got two kids by two different mothers
Got men without my blood that I would call brothers
Easy to fall in love so I've been hurt about a dozen times
But it just made me get up and write another rhyme
See I don't know if I'm idealist or realist
I just know me and Nottz are the illest so feel this
Odd Couple, I'm Oscar he Felix
The opposite but we still mix
Whether we be...

[Scratch Hook]:
Comin' and goin'
So
Release yourself
You can't keep
Comin' and goin'
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout
Y'all cats don't know what the grind 'bout
Comin' and goin'
Ya know your boy
Stay on my grind
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout
Comin' and goin'

[Verse Three] [Asher Roth]:
Now, absolutely I've been blessed with opportunity
I'll
Shake the hand, show respect, no matter who I meet with
No regrets, live my life and take a few to breathe
Then I keep it movin' on cause I got a crew to feed
Like cigarettes and sex or expensive jewelry
I feel as if the music biz is simply only usin' me
With no idea what is real or what they'll do to me
I gotta keep improvin' makin' music from the human beat
And truthfully I want the one, not just the two or three
And if it's up to me then shoot the ruler I am soon to be
Cause losin' I ain't choosin', guess it's disillusioned me
Prove it that I'm proven, when I do it, do it to a tee
So tell the blue in me go spew into the sewer streets
Go and grab your rosary and priest speaks my eulogy
I keep pursuin', ain't never losin' sight of who I be
The truth indeed
And the reason why all you others keep...

[Scratch Hook]:
Comin' and goin'
So
Release yourself
You can't keep
Comin' and goin'
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout
Y'all cats don't know what the grind 'bout
Comin' and goin'
Ya know your boy
Stay on my grind
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout
Comin' and goin'{"Oh someday... no I ain't wastin no more tiiiime"}

[Rhymefest]
Southside step up, and get you a slice
Eastside step up, and get you a slice
Westside step up, and get you a slice
Northside step up, and get you a slice
Chi-Town step up, and get you a slice
L.A. step up, and get you a slice
N.Y. step up, and get you a slice
It's just a slice of the devil's pie, ah-c'mon

[Hook]
{"Christians all say"} Yeah they say
{"In God we trust"} Uh-huh
{"What we gon' do, when he comes back 'round to us"}
Well it's not for us to say
{"Everyday, yeahhh"}
{"Girls drugs dancers and lust"} Uh-huh, uh-huh
{"What we gon' do when it all comes back to us"}

[Rhymefest]
Look; times is hard, life is hard
I lost my job, baby oh my God
My wife is nauseous, she pregnant as hell
My mistress on the cell sayin she gon' tell
My Uncle in the cell sayin he want bail
My granddaddy can't see, claimin he need Braille
I'm fightin for strength, in the street grindin for cents
I know I'm ahead of my time but I'm behind on my rent
Askin Kanye for money just to pay on my gas bill
He asked me for it back, nigga brush up on your math skills
Nothin plus zip equals zero; he couldn't relate
That nigga ain't been broke since "H to the Izzo"
That's whem my man Biddle stopped by with two little
Pills I could put in the bag and sell like Skittles
One for ten, fifteen for two
Now tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do?

[Hook] w/ different ad libs

[Rhymefest]
Take a neighborhood full of hongry blacks
Within 3 beeper shops, 2 liquor stores and one laundromat
No banks, just a Check'n'Go, everywhere you go
You don't wanna ask too much though
We gon' make a tasty pastry, that you can't get in a bakery
I picture hopelessness from slavery {*gasp*}
Can you smell it yet, a few churches that almost care
I know you heathens ready to eat, we almost there
Somebody pass a couple of gangs of Glocks
Politicians are quick to cop, sprinkle pie me on the top
While I, couldn't be faster, recipe for disaster
Gunshots is the devil's laughter
Like you tried to play fair and yo' ass lost
Then you tried to get gangsta, homey you mad soft
Overcrowded jails puttin pounds on Ashcroft
Don't forget the glaze, your devils buyin the crack sauce

[Hook] w/ different ad libs

[Rhymefest]
Now George Bush step up, and get you a slice
Tony Blair step up, and get you a slice
Rumsfeld step up, and get you a slice
Condi Rice step up, and get you a slice
Wait, I'mma step up, and get you a slice
My baby momma stepped up, and got her a slice
E'rybody step up, and get you a slice
It's just a slice of the devil's pie, ah-c'mon

I said - step right up, hear ye hear ye
Hear me clearly this here more than theory
Young males plays the judge and jury
Black filled with fury first time I met my dad
Through a cell, wire and phone, wiring home
Back in my cell and dyin alone, prayin to God
Like I'm raggedly sewn, askin the Lord - why ain't I home
Regardless of what I was on, I know you the king
Tell Satan I don't owe him a thing
Slingin them O's, and now he got my soul in the sling
I know I messed up a couple of times
Bust some nines, on anybody fuckin with mine
That's when my life got disasterous, I was blasphemous
I know my momma didn't ask for this
You got them demons waitin for me with the caskets lit
Please Lord, let this bastard live

[Hook] w/ different ad libs

[Rhymefest]
Yeah yeah, Chi-Town in the house
Rhymefest in the house
Yo Mark, get out here nigga
We gotta go get up with these girls
These guns, this pussy... {*fades*}[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Two steps from the border line
Anything closer will kiss the nine
Think I'm out the game? You out of your mind
Cuz I stay on track, like transit line
Keep it nappy or braided up
Dirty in the cockpit, blazin' up
Stop frontin' when you made it up
Tellin' all my hoes, you can't spray it up
Hah, huggin' nuts like tighty whites
Still trickin' on hoes like Heidi Fleiss
You know why niggas don't give you much respect
Cuz they seen you gettin' slapped with the empty gat
Know Dirt, like bow know death
When I'm huntin' down, birds of rap
Hate Dog, cuz I ate your cat
And you can eat my ass and have a coke with that
Use a spoon, unless you want a fork
Pull my dick out, watch the room get dark
Stay high with the zombie walk
Gotta sit my ass down, like Rosa Parks

[Hook 2X: high pitched female (Ol' Dirty Bastard)]
Dirty Dirty, you tell me how you do it
It look so easy, like there was nothin' to it
But they don't understand, about the Dirty M.C
It's the.... (Ohhhhhhhhhh), new track by ODB

[Rhymefest]
They say dirt and sunshine make the flowers grow
I say, fuck a bitch raw and drive your nut on the floor
Call it what you want, you son of a ho
I was 5 percent til' white bitches came and dropped it down to four
3, 2, 1, I can lick the sun with my tongue
Pull it out and smack a nigga, just for thinkin' I'm done
Shut your trap, razor blade cut your wrap
Fat girls seen me comin', started tuckin' their flab
Rhymefest and Dirt Dog, gon' spark this
The day he got to heaven, track mud on the carpets
Hot like the hot potato, you niggas ain't macho
You hot as gazpacho
Go to the show, for hot dogs and nacho's
This me and Dirt Dog's style, it's not yours

[Chorus 2X}

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
What can make a ho, look more cuter
Hennessey shots, or smoke more Buddha?

[Rhymefest]
I don't know Dirt, now she look like Zab Judah
Test my manhood, go get my dick ruler

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Now you hungry, wanna eat right through her
But you better first track for a noter
Like does she have a best friend, or a daughter
Has she ever tried fuckin' under water

[Rhymefest]
Down down with the fishes, deep sea dishes
I ain't a genie, bitch, I don't respect your wishes
This trick ain't fuckin' me though, god damn
Something very wrong, I don't understand

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Misinterpetate, let me break it down
Two pulls make the your merry go round
Touch your toes, show me that rose
Butt naked, in a Wu-Tang pose
Wide open, girl, everything goes
Real freaky, when you powder that nose

[Rhymefest]
Keep it and move, I sleep in the nude
I'm keepin' it rude, pull out my dick and pee in the food
On the way to the stars, don, where's the map?
We fuckin' there, and we gonna fuck back

[Hook 2X]

[Outro: Rhymefest]
Yeah, Dirt Dog, Rhymefest, you want it, man
Rest in peace, I know you heaven right now
Trackin' mud on the carpet, so, we gon' let ya
Do what you do it's the ohhhhhhh
Don't forget the crew, it's the Wuuuuuu
I thought you knew, it's the Ol' Dirt Dog
Rhymefest, yeah yeah, from now to 3000, man
What's rap with Dirty? What's the world without Dirt?
Just a bunch of fuckin' water, ohhhhhhhhh
We out....[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Yo, stepping fresh out the clean, through the fog
I be that Ol' stinkin' Dirt McGirt dog, with a hurtin' for ya
That nigga liftin' ya skirt, learned it in the dark
Hurtin' bitches feelings on purpose, I'm a dog
Biting, no -- I don't bite, see
I just like to nibble on ya nipple, a little
It's not a riddle, or game, with dope
I just wanna stroke or poke, you in the right place
As if your pussy got a nice face
You need to stop fucking with lightweights
See my Roc chain is heavy, cock game, is ready
To shoot, oh bitch, go get cute
Cuz you can easily get treated like a prostitute
Please believe me, I like it raw, because I'm so freaky
Dirty, but a nigga still shining when you see me
You know that nigga, A, Son
Never been tooken out, Dame, good looking out
Hoes holla!

[Hook: Rhymefest (girl) {Ol' Dirty Bastard}]
I'mma keep it real, don't hurt me
A nigga like me, love the ill punani, cuz I'm dirty
Please don't flirt with the Dirt McGirt
When I'm done, liftin' ya skirt, then this mic get hurt, u know
(Don't hurt me, Dirty) {Okay}
(I promise, I won't you, Dirty) {You sure?}
(Don't hurt me, again) {Okay} (Don't, don't, don't hurt me again)

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Aiyo, my album gets crazy, but I'm still on the low
Your style is flashy, and you don't got no hoes
Don't front, I spit classics, you know how it go
On my leisure, Lisa give me so much throat
Well I need ya, bitch, betta have my dough
And Indonesia, in the Dutch, already rolled
Don't let 'em fool ya, tell you, Ol' Dirty's a joke
Somebody school her, tell her Ol' Dirty's a pro
First it's marriage.... then it's babies....
You know, Dirt love the babies.... (aiyo, bounce with me now)
It's game time, baby, ball with me now, I'm in your court, now
In your grand marquee, on tour with me now
With the Benz, laid back, in the hood with me now
Momma said she wanna go with me, cuz I make her feel good
When she go away with me, Ol' Dirty, nigga!

[Hook]

[Outro: Ol' Dirty Bastard (girl)]
(Don't hurt me, again, don't, don't, don't hurt me again)
Yeah, I'm back, what you thought?
(Don't hurt me, again, don't, don't, don't hurt me again)
Shake ya ass to this!{*scratched: "Dy-no-mite!"*}
Just Blaaaaze!

[Rhymefest]
Wait hold the phone, muh'fucker pass the mic
Spread the word like Pastor hype, this ain't mass but like
We can congregate and mash tonight
The boys in blue, I'll show you what the brass is like
The perfect storm, like when disaster strike
Or Knievel when he crashed his bike
I'm the ashy type, like the knuckles on an inmate locked up
'Cept I stay on the grind, my "Blue Collar" popped up
Blue collar rap, why I call it that?
Shit I know more real niggas at U-Haul than hauled crack
You ain't a stand up man? Well you fall and crawl back
You a long distance thug, the fuck you call that?
See - this is how a track should pound
And if King was alive this is how he would sound
"You a soft-ass nigga, you a mark, you a gump
Fuckin lame, you a coward, you a punk, you a chuuump"

[Hook]
I'm the light, I'm the fuse, Rhyme-F-E-S-T
I'm {*"Dy-no-mite!"*}
Niggas runnin for cover from the fallin debris
I'm {*"Dy-no-mite!"*}
Explosive, nigga blowin up the streets
I'm {*"Dy-no-mite!"*}
I'm the keg, I'm the powder, I'm the fuse, I'm the lighter
If it look like a fire I'm {*"Dy-no-mite!"*}

[Rhymefest]
You would never stand the challenge
What the preacher preachin what the teacher taught
I dropped out of school, stayed on the street and fought
Like Disciples! Jeffrey Manor to be exact
Where how you wear yo' hat made you prone to attack
Made you, made you, made you go and get a strap
And keep you bustin 'til your enemies was gone from the map
Like a killer or a man or a giant when I stand
Open my palm bitch, I got the world in my hand
Got a gun and a plan, I got the bible and the Qu'ran
I got a bomb like I live in Iran
I got niggas to ride with me, hold me down in the street
And deep down I wonder if they the beast, I mean
I mean the police, the feds that police them street
Get in the studio, then try to influence my speech
Like a rat stool pigeon or a mark or a gump
Fuckin lame, you a coward, you a punk, you a chump

[Hook]

[Rhymefest]
You would sell your own momma for a piece of a crumb
A piece of the crunk, that ain't even where you from
Youse a follower (what~!) that's right, a fuckin follower
Probably wearin a wire, so I don't even talk to ya
You think these niggas is thugs, they officers
Call the oficers, tell 'em get 'em officers, 'fore I show you
'Bout a killer or a man or a giant when I stand
Open my palm bitch, I got the world in my hand
Got a gun and a plan, I got the Torah and the Qu'ran
I got your toddler in the back of a van
I got a hostage and a list of demands, I gotta gotta
'bout a thousand dollars say you couldn't sit where I stand
All these niggas that spit threats, hoes that get wet
My style's runnin to the toilet, you ain't seen shit yet
Yet, yet and still I keep it hot like Mexican meals
I got a Cadillac stretch Deville
I can show you how to flip for real
Gangsters don't hold the rock, but they know how to flip it and chill
Dime bag-ass niggas ain't large
When the Patriot Act come hit they ass with the terrorist charge
And we, is what they made it fo'
You think it's all about Arabs? It's a war on the po', we gotta go
Like a killer or a man or a giant when he stand
Open your palm bitch, we got the world in our hand

[Hook]

{*explosion*}[Intro]
Neverrr know how much I love you (woo!)
Neverrr know how much I care (No I.D.)
And when you put your arms around me
I get the fever that's so hard to bare
You give me fever

[Rhymefest]
Uhh, here go that arrogant, stuffy head, cold leave you achin
From asses ah-shakin all night to rest well medicine
It's that {FE-VER} take two of these, call me in the mornin
You gon' still feel sick, cause it's that {give you that fever}
I give 'em all the plague, I'm awfully paid
And still make a cold starve for days
Never the type that ran, whatever the fight I'm in
You half-hearted, but I take this medicine like a man
For that {FE-VER} that keep these niggas sweatin bullets
Clack clack, naw them the ones that you caught for tryin to pull it
This that {FE-VER} somebody warn the industry
'Fest on FIRE, and burnin in the third degree
'Til they murder me, 5-0 get no words from me
And if they do then that's perjury

[Hook]
{FE-VER} Hot like hot sauce
Uhh, we got we got that fe-verrr
Play women so false, flick your drawers off
Fuh, fuh-fuh, we got that fe-verrr
{FE-VER} Hot like hot sauce
Uhh, we got we got that fe-verrr
Play women so false, flick your drawers off
Yeah we got, we got that fe-verrr

[Rhymefest]
Hmm, left the path to wipe sweat from his brow
Except that his smile'll infect crowds
Hot as Hades, I got a lot of ladies strippin down to they drawers
Hittin the floor like OWWWW
That's him, and by him I mean me
By me, you seem weak homey like yo' heart pump green tea
I stack greenbacks then lean back, scorchin hot
My torch'll leave yo' ass charcoal black, I got that {FE-VER}
You better listen to them old wives' tales
I can look in yo' eyes, you high as hell for that {FE-VER}
Rhymefest Peligrino, I quench thrist
Niggas better act like that bitch work
I'm workin progress (the pimp's back) youse a work in progress
You feelin the son/sun, respect my hotness
So many fine chicks shit's gettin monotonous
But still I love the way that she shakes her maracas for that

[Hook]

[Rhymefest]
Step in the club with my swagger, niggas get bruised & then battered
Grind mode is what I'm reppin and yep!
Hot as the grease when it sizzle and pop in your eye
Now you shrivel and chickens be gigglin like {give you that fever}
Yeah homey, I makes that club turn to a sweatbox
Like 50 horny Jamaicans with dreadlocks
30 chicks in the lobby, probably 5 of 'em ready to party
Cause I'm an ol' funny nigga like Redd Foxx
But this is more than jokes, y'all niggas sorta broke
You can never be hot as me, you can't even afford a coat
I got that {FE-VER} ha-ha-ha-hot as hellfire, brimstone
Stiletto brim hats, bitches with gems on
Niggas with Timbs on, Jenny Jones to Jim Jones
I get the d-down like syndrome
I get r-round like rims on, the ghetto King Kong that sing songs
And made a BILLION DOLLARS ON RINGTONES~!

[Hook]

[Outro]
FE-VER! Everybody's, got that fever, give you that fever
FE-VER! Everybody's, got that fever
FE-VER! Everybody's, got that fever, give you that fever
FE-VER![Verse 1: Kanye West]
Ayo, rippin' y'all niggas is the easiest
Y'all style is the nacho cheesiest
Everybody wanna shine, they the greediest
When they know they bank account is the measliest
You gotta know when to hold 'em
Know when to fold 'em
Know when to run when my niggas be rollin'
Holdin' your gun, especially if you owe 'em
Watchin' yo back, especially in the mornin'
Now niggas give you a pound and tell you, "Be safe."
Like you carryin' a million dollars in a briefcase
Now you're all paranoid like, "Is this shit laced?"
My niggas come in all black like deep space
When we turn the toast
Turn you to a ghost
Any more want they girl to play Demi Moore?
As long as you sure
My point is mainly that
We maniacs
Maniacs nigga what

[Hook]
"I can fight with the best"
Don't let 'em hold you down nigga
"But I can only go"
You can go another round nigga
"So many rounds"
Even if you gotta slug it out
If you gotta thug it out, thug it out
"I can fight with the best"
Don't let 'em hold you down nigga
"But I can only go"
You can go another round nigga
"So many rounds"
A lot of MCs came to my showdown
And watch me put the low down

[Verse 2: Rhymefest]
Nothin' nice when you fightin' for your life
With the ruger, did he shoot him?
Did you see it? Was it right?
Did he deserve that? (naw)
Ask 'em maine
Did he know he turned his son to a bastard maine?
If I see him on the street, I'mma blast him maine
Have a ? and a ? in the casket maine
This guy saw me on the strip, tried to out the thang
I told 'em, "Slow up. This wasn't even about you maine."
He must of thought I was scared though
Unprepared though
Oh no
Here come my guys hoppin' out the Volvo
Fo' fo' out in the clear
One shot hit 'em in the ear
Open the trunk, put 'em in here
What it is stick? Put it in gear
You need to know you can't fuck with my blood
We
Throw you in the trunk
Get you drugged
Take you to your own grave
That's the shit you dug
Now it take at least six niggas to pick you up
C'mon

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rhymefest]
Got my money and my loot now
Tell the truth now
Don't make me grab the .380
Don't wanna shoot ya
You got a little girl?
Think about her future
You need an outfit
These slugs should suit ya
Like 5-0 my nigga, I hot pursuit ya
Bullets trimmin' the side of your head like crew cut
Used to be po'
Never could afford new stuff
Even so
We grabbed ski masks to do stuff
All on ten
Niggas was high and juiced up
While you livin' with your girlfriend like a moocher
Get your own shit, be about grown shit
When the chrome spit, you can hear a bone split
I don't give a fuck 'bout who you gon' get
After you dead, killin' him is just a bonus
Ding ding ding
You my millionth customer
Yo K? Why these niggas always think they can fuck with us

[Hook]

Down down
Down down
Down down{*scratched: "Get down!"*}

[Hook One: female singer] + (male voice)
You need to get down

You need to get down (and I'm gon' get down)
(D-down d-down down) He need to get doww-OWWW-owwwn

[Rhymefest]
Yeah, I aim to spit, and maim your clique

Down I came to get, up to claim my shit
Raw like 'caine and gettin brain from brainless chicks
It's, yo', party - dowutchyalike
Dis, my, mission - gon' fuck tonight
Up in the club and like see what the buzz is like
Niggas who pop shit gon' feel what crutches like
The slugs is like; I keep the whole hood fiendin
I don't smoke but I know what drugs they like
I'm the man to see, livin the fantasy
Pocket full of Stones like Sly and the Family
Lift your shirt girl, show me the mammaries
Next week I'll still have good memories
All, I, Do, the clique with me
Sign the check nigga don't say shit to me
This is history; what rapper you know
Before his record drop is a Grammy winner G?
Me I came to get, down surround the sound
Bounce from town to town, 'Fest gon' put shit (down)

[Hook One]

[Hook Two: female singer] + (male voice) + {'Fest}
(And I'm gon' get down) {Now here I am now}
We came to get down (And I'm gon' get down) {Doin my thing now}

He came to get (D-down d-down dow-owwwn) He came to get doww-OWWW-owwwn

[Rhymefest]
You dangerous (yeah) but I'm game for this (yeah)
And I don't kiss cause that can get kankerous
White girls be claimin the sun is cancerous
Pull my dick out and I done caused a damn eclipse!
I'm on some shit, heh, you want some shit? (what?)
This my town dawg, watch what tone you get
This Windy City nigga, don't get blown to bits
Archaeologist nigga I stay with a bone to pick
Goin tit for tat, black aristocrat
Born with a gift to mack anywhere chicks is at
Malaysians, Haitians, Asians mixed with black
Bring 'em back to the block like yeah nigga, get with that
Fuck raisin the bar, man I MADE the bar
Went to Harvard Law like Cochran, I aced the bar
Just in case I get faced with a case tomorrow
Look in my face and they race to get Che disbarred
Nah I'm chillin baby, now make it poke child
With meditate I help you bring your inner ho out
We'll regulate and get it crackin like a coke house
Pretty panties with some fanny I'mma make her go (down)

[Hook One]

[Rhymefest] + {female singer}
You got somethin to prove? (Get down baby)
Oh she ready to move (Get down baby)
You got to stay in the groove (Get down baby)

Now she ready to move (Get down baby)
You got to stay in the groove (Get down baby)

{*scratched: "Get down!"*}

{He came to get doww-OWWW-owwwn}[Verse 1 - Mikkey Halsted]
That nigga Mikkey. Kanye. Y'all know

Man I was sick of them bill collectors callin' my crib
And the filthy ass roaches tryin' to crawl in my shit (all in a nigga's cereal)
Before I flip, nigga had to keep callin' them tricks
See I spit now, now these hoes all on my dick (oh you're a rapper?!)
Like "Mikkey won't you take me out?"
Chick please, it takes more than a rat to get cheese
You can lick deez
I worked hard to get G's
You can strip tease
That's too freaky? Well bitch leave!
I'm a cheap nigga
Keep my money discreet nigga
Cause chickens keep talkin' in the streets nigga
So I keep itchy
With a clip that'll spit fifty
Make fifty million spittin' over beats nigga please nigga

[Hook]
I just got a good ass job
The pay is good but the work is too hard
And I don't want to work anymore
So I won't stop till I reach the top
Now I just bought a brand new car
GS4 but the notes is too high
So I'm gonna hit the club and pull some hoes
Before they re-possess my ride

[Verse 2 - Kanye West]
Nigga please
You work for UPS
I work for Mickey D's
I plotted on stickin' niggas for at least fifty G's
Run up in they crib for the safe and the keys
Y'all ain't safe around me
We done made wild stacks
Made it to Cadillacs
And still get pulled over for "drivin' while black"
While back bill collectors call
We ain't answer ("He ain't here")
Light company will have to come and blow out our candles
Now you know I got's to take a plane to Jamaica
I Dream Cash like Sega
We workin' with some paper
This spins a lot different from the Cutlass I was whippin'
Y'all niggas still trippin'
Got beef? Pop the clip in
Only a bitch would worry about his obituary
Don't worry
I got something that'll get very close to that
Burn tracks, I ain't suppose to rap
Niggas told me that
Now bitch kiss my plaques
C'mon

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Rhymefest]
I used to work at Steak N' Shake 30 hours a week
Niggas ain't even supervisors, tryin' to act like they chief
Talkin' bout "Get them fries. Naw, turn the meat."
Soundin' like a bitch
Hit him in his mouth then quit
Try to picture this
A king on a slave ship
Workin' the grave shift and ain't even made shit
Tell my crooked ass uncle put me up on the lip?
Drop grease, then slip, get insurance, take trips
Nigga what? Set it up
Get with shorty in the front
I've been skimmin' off the register
"Now Che..." "Shut the fuck up and do it my way"
Don't get caught on camera on your off day
Like Ice Cube on Friday
If I worked in the mall, I be sellin' Coogis out the back
Got a gig at Blockbuster sellin' movies out my 'Lac
Any job that I'm at I'm gettin' goofys for they stacks
If the supervisor comes, nigga be cool and relax
Y'all be workin' hard, I be hardly workin'
And even though our check small, our pockets hardly hurtin'
If I was a DJ it wouldn't take me long
Before drug dealers paid me to play they wack ass songs
C'mon

[Hook][Hook] (Rhymefest)
Everybody wishes they could live this life
(Cause it's the life to live baby)
So when the chance come don't let it pass you by
(Naw, don't let it walk on by, no)
Everything you went through are your means to fly
(So what you gon' do?)
I'm about to jump up here and touch the sky
Here we go

(Fly how high, how high?) [x4]

[Verse One] [Rhymefest]
Follow it just leave
No team, no car
Dreams, no lights, one star
Me, so good, so far
Chi-Town boss can get you from behind bars
It's padlocked
Hold my hands up when the cash drop
Music was the last stop
I was a have not
Dropped out of high school, still had high hopes
Puffin' that hydro, it kept my eyes closed
Caught a felony for some things that I sold
So when Barack ran man, I could not vote
Heart felt sting
Pushed pass the pain
But I still stay fly when it rains on my wings
Icarus
Sky high, picture this
Look down
It's all insignificant
Look up
Oooh, it's magnificence
It's so intense I feel like my wings left prints
On a cloud

[Verse Two] [Big Pooh]
My lifetime line
Is every line you repeat
A piece of my soul designed for you to keep
The price that I pay ain't cheap
I gotta go harder
Tryin' to fight sleep
Fightin' off contentment
I got a long way to go
I long way from sleepin' on floors
Niggas came a long way from knockin' on doors
To workin' two jobs
Sellin' out shows

[Phonte]
Fans yellin' out "Ho"
Cause we don't be yellin' out raps
We articulate prose
My rhymes is tighter
Take a walk through the crowd
And niggas tell me, LB bring the hoes/hose out like fire fighters
I won't stop rockin' till I expire
And I inspire dudes to get on they lunchbox
Make your own meal
Fuck waitin' for an alley-oop
Get up off your ass and work on your jump shot
Get high nigga

[Verse Three] [Rhymefest]
My eyes got sick
I'm tryin' to get rich
Best cure for depression is to make more hits
Girls everywhere, "El Che's that shit."
Push your top down, sign my name on your tits
Ooh this the life that I dream 'bout
Dream girl, yeah, hustle with her wings out
I want an angel I ain't got to strangle
Don't try to con me, baby what's your angle?
Maybe I'm paranoid
Thinkin' bout the past tense
Cause in the past, real love took an absence
You my Sarah Palin baby, we mavericks
Introduce to the Johnson, Magic
What you want, material or passion?
Or what I'm doin', am I tellin' or am I askin'?
We got to break it all down like fractions
Cause when they leave, am I'm cryin' or I'm laughin'
I think I'm laughin'
Ha ha ha ha ha

So y'all better quit playin' with God

[Verse 1]
Soon as they like you make 'em unlike you
Cause kissin' people ass is so unlike you
The only rapper compared to Michael
So here's a few hatin'-ass niggas to fight you
And here's a few snake-ass niggas to bite you
And I don't even wanna hear 'bout what niggas might do
Old niggas mentally still in high school
Since the tight jeans they ain't never liked you
Pink-ass polos with a fuckin' backpack
But everybody know you brought real rap back
Nobody had swag, man, we the Rat Pack
Virgil, Pyrex, Don C snapback
Ibn diamond, Chi-town shinin'
Monop' in this bitch again, changed the climate
Hop in this bitch again, same thing I'm in
Until the day I get struck by lightning

[Hook]
I am a god
So hurry up with my damn massage
In a French-ass restaurant
Hurry up with my damn croissants
I am a god

AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!

[Verse 2]
I just talked to Jesus
He said, "What up, Yeezus?"
I said, "Shit I'm chillin'
Tryna stack these millions"
