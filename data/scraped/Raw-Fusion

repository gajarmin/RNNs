[2Pac]
The caper was planned, I called my main man Money B
I'm bout to go snuff this kid called Billboard Charts, run with me

[Money B]
Billboard Charts, I remember that name, tell me more 'Pac

[2Pac]
He's stupid for loops and he's got me (CUCKOO!) for goin pop

[Money B]
When do we drop him? (What?) Knock him and take his loot?
(Snap crackle) bang bang, there's blood on his fuckin shoe

[2Pac]
Uh-uh, nobody shoot (Why?) Cause that ain't the way to go
We gotta convince him to play our tracks on the radio

[Money B]
Aiyyo let me convince him (hah), a clip and an AK
SHIT'LL BE OKAY, cause he'll play what I say

[2Pac]
Well that's how it goes, ain't nuttin left but to pull it
(Takin no prisoners) Here I come... NUMBER ONE WITH A BULLET

	*number one chorus*
Here I come (number one) number one (here I come)
Here I come (number one) NUMBER ONE WITH A BULLET
Here I come (number one) number one (here I come
Number one with the) "BUCK BUCK BUCK!"
(Number one) here I come (number one) here I come
(Number one) number one (here I come) NUMBER ONE WITH A BULLET
Here I come (number one) number one (here I come
Number one with the) "BUCK BUCK BUCK!"

[2Pac] Hey yo, check this out, we wanna get a contract so we can get our money

	*interlude*
[shady industry rap]
Ohhhhh, you kids like to rap huh?  I love rap music
Hey, I really like your groovy threads
But you need a couple things, you need a couple more things
	(hey yo, check this out, we don't wanna hear all that)
To really make it in the business
We need, baggy pants and ruffles, how bout some hightop fades
	[2Pac] Ahh hell no, ohh HELL NO... yo Mon, he buggin
With yellow hightop streaks
Ohh yeah, but really there's a couple more things we need
	[2Pac] Fuck that, that's that bullshit
We're gonna really need some newjack swing beat R&B hip-hop crap
Ohh you're gonna need dancers, what's a hip-hop show without dancers
Explosions, light shows...


[both] FREEZE! Please, Mr. BillB freeze!
[Money B]
Drop to your knees, or I'll pop and you'll knock Z's
(Musta mistook me for a crook) searchin for a hook
(Ya took another look, checked my rhymebook)
Huh, nothin but hits upon mo' hits
(I ain't tryin to hear this shit) from the tricks in the business

[2Pac]
Money, I told ya how they played me
FROM A TO Z, LIKE AN H-O-E, glad ya came to save me
(Well I didn't want to make another lullaby)
Come soft as butter I, guess that I'm doomed no matter what I try

[Money B]
The charts won't give us any justice

[2Pac]
Mon we gotta bust this
Pull it if he moves, then I (bust this) splat
(on the wall like a fly) tell him why

[Money B]
Well if that's what it takes to be number one, number one here I come

	*number one chorus* (repeat to end)[Money B]
Okay ni-ggas, and ba-bettes
I hope you ready for this one, cause I am Money B
Coolin in the house with the Piano Man, yaknowhatI'msayin?
And we bout to get busy, like thiiis, check it out!

Tinkle tinkle tinkle, plinkle plinkle plink
This groove moves me, but whattayou think it takes
To make a hip-hop masterpiece, well if has at least
A break with a shuffle, Money B will bust a couple
Of fly funky phrases, cause my rhymes get praises
Even add the flavor with the {*scratch*} because it pays
It's written by the groceries, or should I say the veggies
Come over here fair maiden, allow me to pull the wedgie
From the baggy pants you're wearin, excuse me for starin
You've got a very nice rear I hope you don't mind sharin
A minute to get to know me, I'm sure you will adore me
So walk and talk with me cause every freckle has a story
I'm showin that this is, fact and not fictitious
Lend me your ear, ba-bay, cause I'm your poetry man
I make it alright, youknowhatI'msayin?
I'll be your guidin light your superstar but only if you let me be him
So while you think it over I'll be rockin to the P.M

{*DJ Fuse scratches: "Yo Piano Man", "rock rock on"*}
{*Shock G, a.k.a. the Piano Man, does his keyboard thang*}

Well like I said I'm a poet like a painter with a palette
Of styles, ahhhhh, which one shall it be?
A def freestyle?  I'm not dissin
This one's for partyin, word to your guardian
So be it moms, pops, or your grannie
I'm non-stoppin and clockin, crazy fanny
So hand me, nuff respect, cause it's a must have
Cause I can bust ass, cut you like a mustache
Put you in the headlock, send your butt to Bedrock
Yabba-dabba-dooin, so I suggest you don't be screwin
Around with this you thought you was gonna be down with this?
When donkeys fly, guy
I'm the type of person that your mama always wanted you to be
MC M-O-N-E-Y dash B see
It's a crime to hear your rhyme you thought worthwhile
But yo, you got a style like Private Pyle
Surprise surprise surprise, Gomer
Like Canseco, I take no, and still be hittin homers
Especially when the pitch of the key, as bein thrown to me
Hittin the spot and it rocks'n'rolls and yo Hob
Keynote has gotta be the Piano Man

{*DJ Fuse scratches: "Yo Piano Man", "rock rock on"*}
{*Shock G, a.k.a. the Piano Man, does his keyboard thang*}

Take me to the bridge, but don't cross-over!

{*Fuse scratches, Shock G keeps rockin the ivories*}

The Piano Man, abbreviated it's the P.M
And when he plays, believe me that's what you'll say when you see him
Operatin on the ebonies and ivories beside me pride
No lie I kid you not the man is live, G
He receives me like a huge gulp of Gatorade
He rips it up and later on gets paid
So make the most of this, cut yourself a piece of the rug
And grab a cutie, and grab the booty, real slow
Because, I know you can I know you can can yes you can can
Oh why can't you?  It's easy to dance to
The P.M. not a wax museum, so stop posin
If you're frozen, he'll break the ice cause he's nice
And twice, the fun when Money Fuse get loose
Pourin it on like a bucket of gin and orange juice
Raw Fusion, puttin the Piano Man on display
And this is the way he gets loose

{*time for more Piano Man flava funk*}

And while the Piano Man is wreckin it, I want y'all to check it
Ronice, take us home sweetie

{*while he plays, she sings "Piano Man play your thing" and ad libs*}
{*eventually Fuse joins in for some scratching*}
{*this goes on 'til it's over at seven minutes, two seconds - FUNKY!*}Ok, we're on the air live from Lake Meritt in Oakland, California

Oh yeah, Gutfest is the best thing to happen to California since 1968
So, uh, where are you guys from?
San Diego..]

Gutfest, Gutfest
It's a show, not like you've ever seen befo'
In the park, from noon 'til after dark
There will be blondes, and also girls of bronze
And girls who come from other contries 'round the world
Now, you will see a big display of ladies in a cage
Butt naked, and they're showing off their curves and sexy ways
So pack a bag, and come on down, if you can find the time
We just would like to say welcome to Gutfest '89

Crazy guts, crazy guts, it's Gutfest '89
Crazy guts, crazy guts, it's Gutfest '89
Crazy guts, crazy guts, it's Gutfest '89

The festival is on the lake, the hotel's up the block
It's clean, they've got good rates and they've got lots of rooms in stock
Tell them you're here for Gutfest, you'll get ten bucks off per night
Bring your camera and your condoms, cause we're going to do this right
More girls then you have ever seen are on display right now
Girls with breasts that go va-voom and booties that go pow!
Black girls, white girls, candy stripe girls, girls with lots of back fat
It's safe to say more healthy guts then you can shake a stick at
I trooped in, now let the Gutfest begin
It seems like sin, my head's startin' to spin
Thinkin' what I'm about to clock, all stops are being yanked out
I'm knockin' stank out the box, every chance I get
Because I waited and waited, to make this trip
Yeah, one big stupid butt nest
And I'm'a get mine at this Gutfest

Crazy guts, crazy guts, it's Gutfest '89

Crazy guts, crazy guts, it's Gutfest '89
Crazy guts, crazy guts, it's Gutfest '89

You'll see tourists and you'll meet people from all around the world
At last year's fest I kicked it with a real cute Chinese girl
Sometimes after the shows at night, or in the afternoon
Some guts come up and give you skull right in your hotel room
Most nice girls do not give good brain, for others it's a racket
Some guys leave Gutfest out of luck and go home with a packet

Heavy, slim, big, large, girls with lots of gook
Cover girls and model types, girls who've got the look
Young butterfly, tulip petal, mahogany devine
A thick bitch with big legs, yeah, it's Gutfest '89
Gutfest, Gutfest
Gutfest '89, Gutfest, Gutfest
Gutfest '89 y'all, crazy guts, crazy guts

It's just Gutfest '89 G-f-G-f-G-f-G-f crazy guts

I got this plan, see, and it involves whipped cream, bananas
One girl stands behind me, the other in front...
Well, I never tried this stunt before, but I'll tell you what
We'll bust the cherries, then we'll sprinkle some nuts on top
Then we'll do the splits.  Now what have we got?
G-f-G-f-G-f-G-f crazy guts

Heavy, slim, big, large, girls with lots of gook
Cover girls and model types, girls who've got the look
A red bone with good muscle tone, a young cocoa delight
Wood-panel brown girl who is down, more game then Icy Mike
Young butterfly, tulip petal, mahogany devine
A thick bitch with big legs, it's Gutfest '89

Hip hip hip-a-hip-hooray, DJ Fuse is here to stay
Raw Fusion DJ, hey hey!
Hip hip hip-a-hip-hooray, DJ Fuse is here to stay
Raw Fusion DJ, hey hey!

You say you're new to the style that's worth your while
Prepare to come follow me now
Money is givin you 'nuff of the stuff
And I'm pumpin it wicked and w-ild {*cough*}
You're new to the style that's worth your while
Prepare to come follow me now
Invitin you down where the writing's exciting
Enlightening the gun POW
Sty-leee, sty-leee - what does it mean when it seems
That everyone in the game CLAIMS
To be number one and some of the think the wackness is the newest
And none of the ten MC's out there
Shot and popped and failed to prove this to me
Cause style-a-style is a style, and even a child knows this
Raw Fusion is what I call this one folks and it's the antidote
Been rockin the wack, attackin the pack of newjacks I get the flak from
Umm, ahh, you're shakin and givin me the fits and so I black one
Cause some of the peoples scrupulous
Schooled in just stuff I'm paintin
They're tugiin and pokin and pullin and jokin
And all of their heated debatin
But Clinton's funk they all should wear with me
They say HOW Ron?
I tell them Styleetron they stop and stare
And say wow Ron!
What is it where is it what does it do
And how did you learn to use it?
I tell 'em all it's the nucleus and only DJ Fuse gets
The props for havin the chops to operate in how to use this
The birds, the bees, and the trees, and all of the
Loops and breaks he chooses
Get added, splice, purified, may the lightning
From the Styleetron strike me down if I lied
The chain reaction packs a hell of a punch and such we did so much
To christen DJ Fuse the bio-stylee technician, so..

Hip hip hip-a-hip-hooray, DJ Fuse is here to stay
Raw Fusion DJ, hey hey!
Hip hip hip-a-hip-hooray, DJ Fuse is here to stay
Raw Fusion DJ, hey hey!

{*DJ Fuse cuts'n'scratches*}

[computer voice]
Stylee of DJ Fuse and Money B
The Styleetron rests in total expressive FREEDOM
Examine, your, options

[Money B]
Now, I go with the flow, the show low, he'll stick ya stick ya
And runnin off styles for miles and I'll, get wicked witcha
Me takin a fall CHILD PLEASE, now pick a picture
That I can not imagine cause I'm smashin ya and I'll admit ya
Gave it a nice try, but nice guys, they finish last
Now stand still tobacco pants and let me SMOKE ya ass
It's been a long day and I've been fiendin for a booty HA
I need to hear ya like a coochie needs the cooties
Try to be tough, and give up, you snap a head instead of talkin that
Stuff, straight out cause I'll leave rappers dead I'm cock-strong
You're wrong, if you think Ron won't wreck shit I get busier
Than a one-legged man in a butt-kickin contest
My mind, is sort of like attackin if you check it
You would find, that I could hit you with the clip don't trick
Cause I've no time, shoo fly don't bother me
Don't even try to be startin jack shit
Cause I flip you get hit quick
Get slapped like that, you get curled like a bicep
And flies get swatted - you want beef?  I got it
In the freezer with the wine, before we take a sip
Here's a toast to you.. sucking my dick!

	.. you're on my dick but you can't have it..
	.. you're on my dick but you can't grab it!!..

"Fuck you.  You're an asshole.  Fucking jerk
Eat shit.  Eat shit.  You're an asshole.  Eat shit."[Hook from 'Rhymin' on the Funk']
S-H-I-N-I-N on the funk
And listen to the MCs rhyming on the funk
We solemnly swear; to never bust a style that's bunk
So listen to the way that we're rhyming on the funk

[Humpty Hump]
Yeah! Yo, shock, it's a funky groove, man, it's kind of funky

[Shock G]
You think so? I appreciate that, Hump

[Humpty Hump]
But yo player, how come you and Money B decided to call it?
Why did y'all name it 'Rhyming on the Funk', You know what I'm saying? (Well)
I mean, like, alright, if the beat is funk, and y'all was rapping over it
So obviously you're rhyming on the funk, you know what I'm saying?

[Shock G]
Yeah, that's what I'm saying

[Humpty Hump]
So why would you even name a song like that?
It's obviously rhyming on the funk, it's like you're not trying to be creative

[Shock G]
Yo Humpty man, if you want me to answer your question;
You gotta cool out and listen, alright? (Uh-huh)
Yo, I just named it "Rhyming on the Funk" we kind of..
We decided to call it that, because we know the beat's funky and everything
But it's, it goes.. (Ooh, dig it!) Listen! Just listen! it goes beyond that
The beat's funky but we wanted to let people know where the real funk came from
We didn't mean funk as in funky beats
We meant funk as in the Funk Mob, you know what I'm saying?

[Humpty Hump]
Oh! Funk Mob? (Yeah)
What the hell is the Funk Mob, bunch a brothers don't take a bath? Ha, ha ha

[Shock G]
No, no, Humpty, listen, man
Sometimes you act real dumb, you know what I'm saying?
(Oh, come on!) Funk Mob is like, you know;
All the new deaf producers who's doing the fly beats now
Like the Lynch Mob, the Bomb Squad (Yeah!) PMD, Dr. Dre (Oh! yeah)
They dropping all the hype new stuff, the Hip-Hop stuff
The Funk Mob was the old production crew man, you know what I'm saying?
The Funk Mob is Parliament, Funkadelic, Brides of Funkenstein
Freddie Wesley and the Horny Horns, George Clinton
And Bootsy Collins, you know what I'm saying?
Those kind of people..

[Humpty Hump]
Yo, I know those, I know all of them brothers, man

[Shock G]
They laid the groundwork Humpty, you gotta give it up, man

[Humpty Hump]
Man, I know all of them brothers, man, I know... I heard Bootsy and George Clinton and them
But what I'm trying to say, is that it ain't really like that a new thing, man
The new stuff, the DJs and samplers and things, you got people like me saying
(They laid the groundwork) Stop what you're doing, you know what I'm saying?
(Nah!) it's just, it's a new phase
It ain't nothing like you trying to back there, it ain't

[Shock G]
Humpty, be quiet, man, listen (Pffft.. be quiet)
You're not hearing what I'm saying
All the Hip-Hop stuff we doing now is BASED on what these brothers did
James Brown, all of these people (I know that, Shock)
You got to give credit where credit is due, you know what I'm saying?

[Humpty Hump]
I know this, man, yo, yo, yo, I'm giving credit, man
I'm giving credit, all I'm trying to say (No! You're not though)
See, you're making me upset, man! (You're not giving credit though!)
All I'm trying to say is; that it's cool but it ain't like the newer
Just I'm not from that time period (So What?)
And I don't understand all of that (You don't have to be)
And it ain't all that

[Shock G]
Yo, you don't have to be from that time period to understand it
You know what I'm saying? (It's some of that!) NO-uh, it's all of that
(Psssh, aw, man) Not 'Just Knee Deep' Humpty!

[Humpty Hump]
Oh, uh, I didn't know the Funk Mob made 'Not Just Knee Deep' Oh! man!

[Shock G:]
Well, that's what it is! (Oh, shut up, man, shut up)
You ain't even up on nothing (Alright)
You ain't up on nothing! why don't you just.. (It's MOST of that!)
Huh? I'm not stupid; I heard you, you said it's Most of that
Cool, man, you finally gave it up, though!

[Humpty Hump]
Leave me alone, Shock! Leave me alone!

[Intro from 'Rhymin' on the Funk']
Right here.. Right here.. Right here!
Right here.. Right here.. Right here![Chorus]
S-H-I-N-I-N on the funk
And listen to the emcees rhymin on the funk
We solemnly swear to never bust a style that's bunk
So listen to the way that we're rhyming on the funk

[Shock G]
Now we would like to ask you
Have you ever heard this style befo'
You gotta say no
Cause there ain't no denying
And if you say yes you're lying
People are always wondering
What's up with the Underground
Are they down?
Or is just another new sound
We're saying things
And when we use a beat we use it right
Cause we're not just playing things
Spitting rhymes
Like a Tommy gun spraying things
So when you see us onstage
Don't just stare us down
Or compare our sound
To any other crew ya like
Yo, judge how ya like

[Chorus]

[Money-B]
Riding this like a roller coaster
Hugging the curves and dipping
Like I'm supposed to do
For the Underground troupe
Cause I know I'm the poop
Steaming hot
Stinking up the dance floor
Gonna do it freelance
For the funk, my friends
And all the others in the industry
They want to get with me
(Shock: Why is that, Mon?)
Maybe it's my smooth flow
They know this guy is dope
So they get hip to the style I'm using
It's called Raw Fusion
Ain't no time for ego-tripping
Let it be known
There'll be no slipping on mine
Cause all I want
Is a chunk of this Underground funk

[Chorus]

[Shock G]
Yo, Money-B

[Money-B]
What's up cold Shock G?

[Shock G]
Check it out, would you tell the people what we mean

[Money-B]
What do you mean what we mean?

[Shock G]
You know what I mean
Tell 'em what we mean
When we're R-H-Y-M-I-N on the funk
Let 'em know that we got spunk

[Money-B]
We got it

[Shock G]
And when I count to three
Go on and hit some of that humpty-hump
One, two, three

[Money-B]
Well, I'm humpty-humping
You know that I'm saying something
The funk's in your face
Gonna keep the place jumping
As the beat keeps pumping
I'm tick-tocking 'em
Dope rhymes, I'm dropping 'em
On the twenty-four track
And there ain't no stopping 'em
It's too late to put the tape on pause
Because we're

[funk sample interlude]

[Money-B]
Tell me if you think the beat is nasty
Well get ready, we're going to get sweaty
Just in case I hope you brought a towel in
I'm on the prowl when I hear the bass growling

[Shock G]
Growling like a big bass monster
On a rampage, it's like we were onstage
Shock G speaking from the Underground

[Money-B]
Do they understand?

[Shock G]
I really don't give a damn
Cause we're

[Chorus][Money B]
Now what have I got here?  An instrumental spot, yeah
Time for me to put some funky hip-hop there
.. allow me to do the honors
You know the voice, but did you know the name was Ron or
M-O-N-E-Y dash, B so don't be alarmed
When you be hearin please oh please oh please
Money B, get loose, I never argue
I step up, with a whattup, whattup I'm on you
Are next, what you'd expect a strong rhyme
It goes like this, for a long time
Cause ticka time is money (money) and money is ticka time (time)
And Money gets money everytime, that I go for mine
Line after line, like a laser
I be what they call a leaper, for the ways I
Leap into the airwaves, sky with the rhyme flow
Droppin bombs on the others below
And while I'm climbin, they seem to get smaller than ants
And I'm hyped, cause I can see 'em dancin
And the few, standin 'round waitin
For me to come down, but I keep elevatin
Cause yo, I get up, and then continue to climb..
.. I got hang time

{*DJ Fuse*: "Money B, the freaky deaky", "just hangin.."
.. "like the brother's supposed to"} - 2X

[Money B]
Doowhutchalike, that's what my boy cold Shock'n said
And what I'd like to do, is cold clock the bread
.. and so I make it like a bakery
There's no takin me, so what you make of me?
You're just another perpetratin sucker that steals
While I was makin rhymes, you made crack deals
Thought it was funny you - said "Yo Money's through"
Heard it and hippidy-hopped on like a bunny do
Silly rabbit, kick the habit
Stop smokin, I'm from Oakland
And all that means is that I know where I'm from
And where I'm goin to, cause I'm a (?), see?
I'm kickin it out, better than nice, I'm naughty
Backstage I kiss my girl and my forty
I hear my name cause my people, support me
And those who don't know say, "Go shorty! Go shorty!"
Heads and arms, begin to swing and then
Just like Spike, I +Do the Right Thing+
I like pick a fly topic, to speak about
And then like Jordan on the court'n, I freak it out
I clock a score much higher than a nine point nine
.. I got hang time

{*DJ Fuse*: "Money B, the freaky deaky", "just hangin.."
.. "like the brother's supposed to"} - 2X

[Money B]
Not all about kickin it, but you know this
For kicks I'm takin my flicks in gangster poses
I'm doin this for the money, and I suppose it's
The way I kick my verbals that's why you all, chose this
Ace to be your number one I'm sharp as a knife
Short in stature yet the rep I get is larger than life
And I'm doin this for the Money, and not for my health
And you're correct if you suspect, I'm stuck on myself
I'm not tall, but when I play ball, I take - charge
Cause in this thing, I'm livin EXTRA large
Cause I'm bodacious, I'm bodacious
You're likin the way that I'm sayin it twice
Cause my display is nice, so
Feel free about pressin rewind..
.. uh-huh, I got hang time

{*DJ Fuse*: "Money B, the freaky deaky", "just hangin.."
.. "like the brother's supposed to"} - 2X

[Money B]
Time out, is over, the buzzer is soundin
I catch my breath, the mic is inbounded
I take posession, now I'm in control
So just keep on movin, like Soul II Soul
As I, bring it up, stop, at the top of the key
The pressure's on, they're lookin at me
But it's the competition, that brings out the man in me
I play it cool cause my fans keep fannin me
A team of MC's standin there blockin the hoop
They try a double team, but I don't play that poop
My man Fuse, sets the pick, and I break
Another sucker steps, and so I give him the shake
I give the next one a dose, of the same old drug
As I dip through the hole, he tried to plug
And the last MC in my path, with seconds to go
Standin bout six ten and a half
I take flight, right over the great big punk
And throw down a Darryl Dawkins chocolate thunder dunk!
So next time, you wanna contest you climb
.. punk, I got hang time {*"Yes, yes!"*} see-ya!

{*Fuse scratches to fade*}Me, Colin, Johnny and Moe
In my drop six-eight, the perv was on, and
I was spankin, a full tank and
Feelin great, tape deck, Shabba Rank-in
Headin East on five-eighty, the sun was shinin
Top down, I guess you could say we was excited
Cause John had the hook up
In Hayward, and I was ready to cook, but
The day was just startin
And in no time flat, it began to fall apart when
I looked into my rear view mirror
The bass was slammin, I guess I couldn't hear the
Sirens, yeah it was po-po
And that's O.P.D., for those who don't know
We pulled over, to see what it was all about
He drew his gun and began to shout

Chorus: repeat 2X

"Throw your hands in the air!"
"Freeze, freeze, bout to"	"pull this trigger" --] Slick Rick
"Throw your hands in the air!"
"Give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up"

I say, "Whoa -- don't get excited"
He said, "Shut up little nig-gha, you wanna bite it?
Don't bother, there was a robbery
You look guilty, as far as I can see"
Strip searched, where's the drugs and the money?
Oh you caught me, but
I'm in the backseat handcuffed
But that's when another cop car rolled up
He said, "Yo -- you gotta let em slide
We caught the motherfuckers over on the Westside"
He said, "Oh," with a bitter frown
"That's cool, but I'll see ya round"
We jumped in the Mustang, police brutality's
An everyday thing, where I live
But it made me kind of hungry
But this certain, 7-11 it was the wrong scene
I reached for a chicken sandwich
My brother Colin said, "Damn!"
Cause the man at the front had a sawed-off
He shot once in the air, and then he called off

Chorus

The answer, "Yes sir!"
He took all the money from the cash register
And gave it to the man with the six-pack
He turned to me and said, "YO, BLACK
Act like you didn't see it..."
... so be it!
Now that was too much to take, it's like I'm in
A Nell Carter sitcom, please, give me a break

	Aiyyo, now check this out
	We been through too much today
	I mean it's like, yaknowhatI'msayin?
	The po-lice, the uhh, yaknowhatI'msayin
	This fool come into the store, aiy
	being jacked ain't cool
	I gots to get some trim

Now it's really been a rough day
We all agree, we wanna see the chicks anyway
Mack Mo-E leanin back in the chair, he said
"Wake me up when we get there"
We smashed, ten minutes passed
We found the spot at the end of this to'-up block
We had our doubts
We left Moe in the car, to go check it out
Somethin about it didn't feel right
The girl that opened the door, she was real tight
I seen two more, and they was kinda cute
Sweet like Juicy Fruit
Once said, "Give your feet a rest
While we go in the back, comb our hair, and get dressed"
I heard a lot of clickin noises
And then I heard, "Almost ready boys"
Somethin was real suspicious
"Aiyyo John, what's up with these bah-bies?"
He said, "I just can't know, I just met em"
And then I heard "Get em!"
I looked up, a forty-five at my head
And guess what she said...

"Throw your hands in the air!"
It's jack time, but when I look back
I'm glad we let Mack Moe snore
We was gonna get it, but then he came through the front door
The girl aimed the gun, shot and missed
The kitten must have hurt her wrist
Cause she dropped her gun, another pulled a switchblade
John attacked her, grabbed the knife and cracked her
Colin kicked the gun away
The others got scared, and tried to run away
I pick up the piece that was loaded with lead
And all excitement ceased when I said

Chorus 1/2

[2Pac]
Money, I told ya how they played me

[Money B]
Well if that's what it takes to be number one, number one here I come

	*number one chorus* (repeat to end)[Hook from 'Rhymin' on the Funk']
S-H-I-N-I-N on the funk
And listen to the MCs rhyming on the funk
We solemnly swear; to never bust a style that's bunk
So listen to the way that we're rhyming on the funk

[Humpty Hump]
Yeah! Yo, shock, it's a funky groove, man, it's kind of funky

[Shock G]
You think so? I appreciate that, Hump

[Humpty Hump]
But yo player, how come you and Money B decided to call it?
Why did y'all name it 'Rhyming on the Funk', You know what I'm saying? (Well)
I mean, like, alright, if the beat is funk, and y'all was rapping over it
So obviously you're rhyming on the funk, you know what I'm saying?

[Shock G]
Yeah, that's what I'm saying

[Humpty Hump]
So why would you even name a song like that?
It's obviously rhyming on the funk, it's like you're not trying to be creative

[Shock G]
Yo Humpty man, if you want me to answer your question;
You gotta cool out and listen, alright? (Uh-huh)
Yo, I just named it "Rhyming on the Funk" we kind of..
We decided to call it that, because we know the beat's funky and everything
But it's, it goes.. (Ooh, dig it!) Listen! Just listen! it goes beyond that
The beat's funky but we wanted to let people know where the real funk came from
We didn't mean funk as in funky beats
We meant funk as in the Funk Mob, you know what I'm saying?

[Humpty Hump]
Oh! Funk Mob? (Yeah)
What the hell is the Funk Mob, bunch a brothers don't take a bath? Ha, ha ha

[Shock G]
No, no, Humpty, listen, man
Sometimes you act real dumb, you know what I'm saying?
(Oh, come on!) Funk Mob is like, you know;
All the new deaf producers who's doing the fly beats now
Like the Lynch Mob, the Bomb Squad (Yeah!) PMD, Dr. Dre (Oh! yeah)
They dropping all the hype new stuff, the Hip-Hop stuff
The Funk Mob was the old production crew man, you know what I'm saying?
The Funk Mob is Parliament, Funkadelic, Brides of Funkenstein
Freddie Wesley and the Horny Horns, George Clinton
And Bootsy Collins, you know what I'm saying?
Those kind of people..

[Humpty Hump]
Yo, I know those, I know all of them brothers, man

[Shock G]
They laid the groundwork Humpty, you gotta give it up, man

[Humpty Hump]
Man, I know all of them brothers, man, I know... I heard Bootsy and George Clinton and them
But what I'm trying to say, is that it ain't really like that a new thing, man
The new stuff, the DJs and samplers and things, you got people like me saying
(They laid the groundwork) Stop what you're doing, you know what I'm saying?
(Nah!) it's just, it's a new phase
It ain't nothing like you trying to back there, it ain't

[Shock G]
Humpty, be quiet, man, listen (Pffft.. be quiet)
You're not hearing what I'm saying
All the Hip-Hop stuff we doing now is BASED on what these brothers did
James Brown, all of these people (I know that, Shock)
You got to give credit where credit is due, you know what I'm saying?

[Humpty Hump]
I know this, man, yo, yo, yo, I'm giving credit, man
I'm giving credit, all I'm trying to say (No! You're not though)
See, you're making me upset, man! (You're not giving credit though!)
All I'm trying to say is; that it's cool but it ain't like the newer
Just I'm not from that time period (So What?)
And I don't understand all of that (You don't have to be)
And it ain't all that

[Shock G]
Yo, you don't have to be from that time period to understand it
You know what I'm saying? (It's some of that!) NO-uh, it's all of that
(Psssh, aw, man) Not 'Just Knee Deep' Humpty!

[Humpty Hump]
Oh, uh, I didn't know the Funk Mob made 'Not Just Knee Deep' Oh! man!

[Shock G:]
Well, that's what it is! (Oh, shut up, man, shut up)
You ain't even up on nothing (Alright)
You ain't up on nothing! why don't you just.. (It's MOST of that!)
Huh? I'm not stupid; I heard you, you said it's Most of that
Cool, man, you finally gave it up, though!

[Humpty Hump]
Leave me alone, Shock! Leave me alone!

[Intro from 'Rhymin' on the Funk']
Right here.. Right here.. Right here!
Right here.. Right here.. Right here![Erick Sermon] (Do my thing)

[VERSE 1: Money B]
To the beat, to the beat, to the beat y'all
Old school jams the party people used to dance to I recall
Summertime in Philly, my age about a dozen
Got excited when invited to block parties with my cousins
Tapin every rap jam that slammed on the radio
School time came, on the plane back to the O
Grandmaster Flash, Spoonie G and the Treach' Three
Fearless 4, spirit of hip-hop was etched in me
See, I was down, brah, but let me get down to
?????? V-Town I was down witcha
Back at the high, '84, '85
Lunch time at the break, hip-hop kid live
No jive, I see Boogie B and Commando
Valentino D, we all had plans to
(Shock the house) (until the break of dawn)
I was down with the Funky Fresh 8 when I jumped on
Stage, I got played when I entered the talent show
I ripped it (you ripped it, Mon') but I still didn't win it, though
But now the people know me as Money B
Not just a freckle-faced short lille wanna-be
Breakdance, shell-toe-Adidas and leather-hat-wearin
Now the girls was starin and the props was ffffat
Now at the parties when the bass would pound out
The mic was passed and that's when I found out..

[Chorus]
[????] (People from everywhere watchin the show)
[Erick Sermon] (You're intrigued by the way I do my thing)
(People from everywhere watchin the show)
[KRS-One] (Mi come to rock ya whether you're black or you're white)
(People from everywhere watchin the show)
(You're intrigued by the way I do my thing)
(People from everywhere watchin the show)
[Slick Rick] (Now when we rock upon the mic, we rock the mic - right)

[ VERSE 2: Money B ]
Well, like I was sayin, I was makin a name for myself
At the same time at the flat where I sat
With the turntable, tape deck, Stevie Bo and Greg
Bet that I can turn pro cause I flow and the day I met
The M-a to the c with the dash
M-o-n-e cash came fast on the ave, see?
(Cars ride by with the boomin systems)
With the (funky) (funky, funky, funky) beats in em
And there was no need to look that way or this way
You want a cassette, then you step to the six-trey
And that's where you'll find me, Mone to the side of me
Tryin to get paid in those days sho' was fly to me
But lookin back just like a quarterback days past
I gotta give a shout out to C.J. Flash
For hookin me up with Fuze, oh, excuse me
One more ingredient, Sleuth, yeah, we needed him
For management, but what did I say, oh, we'da been
Stuck, but we hooked up like handle-bar mustache
MGM was the name that we used then
And here comes Shock and Chopmaster J
Some weeks passed away, yo Jim, pass the jay
But then out of nowhere came the sound of Digital Underground
And we was ready to get down
On the local circus, rockin the small crowds
Doin work with crews like K Cloud
Capital Tax, [Name], Red, Black & Green
Benny B and Davey D know what I mean
You see

[ Chorus ]

[ VERSE 3: Money B ]
1989 'Doowutchyalike' dropped
The US wasn't pleased, overseas it went pop
But we finished the LP, attitude healthy
Shit, the earthquake hit, Lord please help me
The bridge collapsed, people had to find means and ways
To cross, we was off to Europe in a few days
A two-months tour and I sure won't forget that
Denmark, Finland, we almost froze, black
Sweden was cool, in Holland we kicked it
London shows was safe, we was wicked
Peace to Mell'O, good lookin out, gee
And everyone else when we came to your country
Movin right along and back to the homefront
In no time everybody's doin the Hump
Puttin the funk in the trunks and back in the boom box
We took the road show straight to the nine-o
( *backstage preparations* )
Well, if you was there, then you know that we got buck
So now you know, I gotta say what's up
To Big Daddy Kane, 3rd Bass and KMD
MC Lyte, 2 Live and the D.O.C
Michel'le, Def Jef saw the first show
Cheeba was down, peace out to the Afros
Latifah like a sis away from home
With AD never leavin the girls alone
45 King, Chill Rob and Apache, Flavor U
Peace to [Name] and the Naughty By Nature crew
My brothers in PE worked it out
Kwamé, Kid'n Play, Young & the Restless know what I'm talkin bout
Silk Tymes, [Name], Special Ed, Heavy D
T-Roy, you're rockin wherever you be
Geto Boys, parents should doin the job
Yo's to Yo-Yo and Ice Cube rollin with the Lench Mob
Shouts out to EMPD and Twin Hype
Mellow Man Ace and the Cypress Hill Tribe
ATL, De La, J.Beez, Quest
Body 'n Soul and Felicia the Poetess
Too $hort and the homies from Oaktown
Tony! Toni! Tonë! - we're reignin in Northern California now
Peace out from DU and Raw Fusion
If you seen it, you know what I mean
Yo

[ Chorus ]
Yeah
And and this one is goin out to my man 2Pacalypse

And it's still the same song

(Do my thing)Ok, we're on the air live from Lake Meritt in Oakland, California
We'll have exclusive coverage of Gutfest '89

Some more food, some more good music...

How's it going, guys, you guys come to Gutfest every year, or what?
Oh yeah, Gutfest is the best thing to happen to California since 1968
So, uh, where are you guys from?
San Diego..]

Gutfest, Gutfest
It's a show, not like you've ever seen befo'
In the park, from noon 'til after dark
There will be blondes, and also girls of bronze
And girls who come from other contries 'round the world
Now, you will see a big display of ladies in a cage
Butt naked, and they're showing off their curves and sexy ways
So pack a bag, and come on down, if you can find the time
We just would like to say welcome to Gutfest '89

Crazy guts, crazy guts, it's Gutfest '89
Crazy guts, crazy guts, it's Gutfest '89
Crazy guts, crazy guts, it's Gutfest '89

The festival is on the lake, the hotel's up the block
It's clean, they've got good rates and they've got lots of rooms in stock
Tell them you're here for Gutfest, you'll get ten bucks off per night
Bring your camera and your condoms, cause we're going to do this right
More girls then you have ever seen are on display right now
Girls with breasts that go va-voom and booties that go pow!
Black girls, white girls, candy stripe girls, girls with lots of back fat
It's safe to say more healthy guts then you can shake a stick at
I trooped in, now let the Gutfest begin
It seems like sin, my head's startin' to spin
Thinkin' what I'm about to clock, all stops are being yanked out
I'm knockin' stank out the box, every chance I get
Because I waited and waited, to make this trip
Yeah, one big stupid butt nest
And I'm'a get mine at this Gutfest

Crazy guts, crazy guts, it's Gutfest '89
Crazy guts, crazy guts, it's Gutfest '89
Crazy guts, crazy guts, it's Gutfest '89
Crazy guts, crazy guts, it's Gutfest '89

You'll see tourists and you'll meet people from all around the world
At last year's fest I kicked it with a real cute Chinese girl
Sometimes after the shows at night, or in the afternoon
Some guts come up and give you skull right in your hotel room
Most nice girls do not give good brain, for others it's a racket
Some guys leave Gutfest out of luck and go home with a packet

Heavy, slim, big, large, girls with lots of gook
Cover girls and model types, girls who've got the look
Young butterfly, tulip petal, mahogany devine
A thick bitch with big legs, yeah, it's Gutfest '89
Gutfest, Gutfest
Gutfest '89, Gutfest, Gutfest
Gutfest '89 y'all, crazy guts, crazy guts
Gutfest '89, Gutfest, Gutfest, and you don't stop

Yo shmoove, peep this: Posdnuous check it out, check it out
Gutfest '89 G-f-G-f-G-f-G-f crazy guts
It's just Gutfest '89 G-f-G-f-G-f-G-f crazy guts

I got this plan, see, and it involves whipped cream, bananas
One girl stands behind me, the other in front...
Well, I never tried this stunt before, but I'll tell you what
We'll bust the cherries, then we'll sprinkle some nuts on top
Then we'll do the splits.  Now what have we got?
G-f-G-f-G-f-G-f crazy guts

Heavy, slim, big, large, girls with lots of gook
Cover girls and model types, girls who've got the look
A red bone with good muscle tone, a young cocoa delight
Wood-panel brown girl who is down, more game then Icy Mike
Young butterfly, tulip petal, mahogany devine
A thick bitch with big legs, it's Gutfest '89
Ah yeah, Gutfest, Gutfest, Gutfest Gutfest

Crazy guts, crazy guts, it's Gutfest '89[Money B]
Now what have I got here?  An instrumental spot, yeah
Time for me to put some funky hip-hop there
.. allow me to do the honors
You know the voice, but did you know the name was Ron or
M-O-N-E-Y dash, B so don't be alarmed
When you be hearin please oh please oh please
Money B, get loose, I never argue
I step up, with a whattup, whattup I'm on you
Are next, what you'd expect a strong rhyme
It goes like this, for a long time
Cause ticka time is money (money) and money is ticka time (time)
And Money gets money everytime, that I go for mine
Line after line, like a laser
I be what they call a leaper, for the ways I
Leap into the airwaves, sky with the rhyme flow
Droppin bombs on the others below
And while I'm climbin, they seem to get smaller than ants
And I'm hyped, cause I can see 'em dancin
And the few, standin 'round waitin
For me to come down, but I keep elevatin
Cause yo, I get up, and then continue to climb..
.. I got hang time

{*DJ Fuse*: "Money B, the freaky deaky", "just hangin.."
.. "like the brother's supposed to"} - 2X

[Money B]
Doowhutchalike, that's what my boy cold Shock'n said
And what I'd like to do, is cold clock the bread
.. and so I make it like a bakery
There's no takin me, so what you make of me?
You're just another perpetratin sucker that steals
While I was makin rhymes, you made crack deals
Thought it was funny you - said "Yo Money's through"
Heard it and hippidy-hopped on like a bunny do
Silly rabbit, kick the habit
Stop smokin, I'm from Oakland
And all that means is that I know where I'm from
And where I'm goin to, cause I'm a (?), see?
I'm kickin it out, better than nice, I'm naughty
Backstage I kiss my girl and my forty
I hear my name cause my people, support me
And those who don't know say, "Go shorty! Go shorty!"
Heads and arms, begin to swing and then
Just like Spike, I +Do the Right Thing+
I like pick a fly topic, to speak about
And then like Jordan on the court'n, I freak it out
I clock a score much higher than a nine point nine
.. I got hang time

{*DJ Fuse*: "Money B, the freaky deaky", "just hangin.."
.. "like the brother's supposed to"} - 2X

[Money B]
Not all about kickin it, but you know this
For kicks I'm takin my flicks in gangster poses
I'm doin this for the money, and I suppose it's
The way I kick my verbals that's why you all, chose this
Ace to be your number one I'm sharp as a knife
Short in stature yet the rep I get is larger than life
And I'm doin this for the Money, and not for my health
And you're correct if you suspect, I'm stuck on myself
I'm not tall, but when I play ball, I take - charge
Cause in this thing, I'm livin EXTRA large
Cause I'm bodacious, I'm bodacious
You're likin the way that I'm sayin it twice
Cause my display is nice, so
Feel free about pressin rewind..
.. uh-huh, I got hang time

{*DJ Fuse*: "Money B, the freaky deaky", "just hangin.."
.. "like the brother's supposed to"} - 2X

[Money B]
Time out, is over, the buzzer is soundin
I catch my breath, the mic is inbounded
I take posession, now I'm in control
So just keep on movin, like Soul II Soul
As I, bring it up, stop, at the top of the key
The pressure's on, they're lookin at me
But it's the competition, that brings out the man in me
I play it cool cause my fans keep fannin me
A team of MC's standin there blockin the hoop
They try a double team, but I don't play that poop
My man Fuse, sets the pick, and I break
Another sucker steps, and so I give him the shake
I give the next one a dose, of the same old drug
As I dip through the hole, he tried to plug
And the last MC in my path, with seconds to go
Standin bout six ten and a half
I take flight, right over the great big punk
And throw down a Darryl Dawkins chocolate thunder dunk!
So next time, you wanna contest you climb
.. punk, I got hang time {*"Yes, yes!"*} see-ya!

{*Fuse scratches to fade*}"Fascinating! Absolutely fascinating!"

[Money B]
Hip hip hip-a-hip-hooray, DJ Fuse is here to stay
Raw Fusion DJ, hey hey!
Hip hip hip-a-hip-hooray, DJ Fuse is here to stay
Raw Fusion DJ, hey hey!

You say you're new to the style that's worth your while
Prepare to come follow me now
Money is givin you 'nuff of the stuff
And I'm pumpin it wicked and w-ild {*cough*}
You're new to the style that's worth your while
Prepare to come follow me now
Invitin you down where the writing's exciting
Enlightening the gun POW
Sty-leee, sty-leee - what does it mean when it seems
That everyone in the game CLAIMS
To be number one and some of the think the wackness is the newest
And none of the ten MC's out there
Shot and popped and failed to prove this to me
Cause style-a-style is a style, and even a child knows this
Raw Fusion is what I call this one folks and it's the antidote
Been rockin the wack, attackin the pack of newjacks I get the flak from
Umm, ahh, you're shakin and givin me the fits and so I black one
Cause some of the peoples scrupulous
Schooled in just stuff I'm paintin
They're tugiin and pokin and pullin and jokin
And all of their heated debatin
But Clinton's funk they all should wear with me
They say HOW Ron?
I tell them Styleetron they stop and stare
And say wow Ron!
What is it where is it what does it do
And how did you learn to use it?
I tell 'em all it's the nucleus and only DJ Fuse gets
The props for havin the chops to operate in how to use this
The birds, the bees, and the trees, and all of the
Loops and breaks he chooses
Get added, splice, purified, may the lightning
From the Styleetron strike me down if I lied

[computer voice]
Stylee of DJ Fuse and Money B
The Styleetron rests in total expressive FREEDOM
Examine, your, options

[Money B]
Now, I go with the flow, the show low, he'll stick ya stick ya
And runnin off styles for miles and I'll, get wicked witcha
Me takin a fall CHILD PLEASE, now pick a picture
That I can not imagine cause I'm smashin ya and I'll admit ya
Gave it a nice try, but nice guys, they finish last
Now stand still tobacco pants and let me SMOKE ya ass
It's been a long day and I've been fiendin for a booty HA
I need to hear ya like a coochie needs the cooties
Try to be tough, and give up, you snap a head instead of talkin that
Stuff, straight out cause I'll leave rappers dead I'm cock-strong
You're wrong, if you think Ron won't wreck shit I get busier
Than a one-legged man in a butt-kickin contest
My mind, is sort of like attackin if you check it
You would find, that I could hit you with the clip don't trick
Cause I've no time, shoo fly don't bother me
Don't even try to be startin jack shit
Cause I flip you get hit quick
Get slapped like that, you get curled like a bicep
And flies get swatted - you want beef?  I got it
In the freezer with the wine, before we take a sip
Here's a toast to you.. sucking my dick!

	.. you're on my dick but you can't have it..
	.. you're on my dick but you can't grab it!!..

"Fuck you.  You're an asshole.  Fucking jerk
Eat shit.  Eat shit.  You're an asshole.  Eat shit."[Chorus]
S-H-I-N-I-N on the funk
And listen to the emcees rhymin on the funk
We solemnly swear to never bust a style that's bunk
So listen to the way that we're rhyming on the funk

[Shock G]
Now we would like to ask you
Have you ever heard this style befo'
You gotta say no
Cause there ain't no denying
And if you say yes you're lying
People are always wondering
What's up with the Underground
Are they down?
Or is just another new sound
We're saying things
And when we use a beat we use it right
Cause we're not just playing things
Spitting rhymes
Like a Tommy gun spraying things
So when you see us onstage
Don't just stare us down
Or compare our sound
To any other crew ya like
Yo, judge how ya like

[Chorus]

[Money-B]
Riding this like a roller coaster
Hugging the curves and dipping
Like I'm supposed to do
For the Underground troupe
Cause I know I'm the poop
Steaming hot
Stinking up the dance floor
Gonna do it freelance
For the funk, my friends
And all the others in the industry
They want to get with me
(Shock: Why is that, Mon?)
Maybe it's my smooth flow
They know this guy is dope
So they get hip to the style I'm using
It's called Raw Fusion
Ain't no time for ego-tripping
Let it be known
There'll be no slipping on mine
Cause all I want
Is a chunk of this Underground funk

[Chorus]

[Shock G]
Yo, Money-B

[Money-B]
What's up cold Shock G?

[Shock G]
Check it out, would you tell the people what we mean

[Money-B]
What do you mean what we mean?

[Shock G]
You know what I mean
Tell 'em what we mean
When we're R-H-Y-M-I-N on the funk
Let 'em know that we got spunk

[Money-B]
We got it

[Shock G]
And when I count to three
Go on and hit some of that humpty-hump
One, two, three

[Money-B]
Well, I'm humpty-humping
You know that I'm saying something
The funk's in your face
Gonna keep the place jumping
As the beat keeps pumping
I'm tick-tocking 'em
Dope rhymes, I'm dropping 'em
On the twenty-four track
And there ain't no stopping 'em
It's too late to put the tape on pause
Because we're

[funk sample interlude]

[Money-B]
Tell me if you think the beat is nasty
Well get ready, we're going to get sweaty
Just in case I hope you brought a towel in
I'm on the prowl when I hear the bass growling

[Shock G]
Growling like a big bass monster
On a rampage, it's like we were onstage
Shock G speaking from the Underground

[Money-B]
Do they understand?

[Shock G]
I really don't give a damn
Cause we're

[Chorus][Money B]
Okay ni-ggas, and ba-bettes
I hope you ready for this one, cause I am Money B
Coolin in the house with the Piano Man, yaknowhatI'msayin?
And we bout to get busy, like thiiis, check it out!

Tinkle tinkle tinkle, plinkle plinkle plink
This groove moves me, but whattayou think it takes
To make a hip-hop masterpiece, well if has at least
A break with a shuffle, Money B will bust a couple
Of fly funky phrases, cause my rhymes get praises
Even add the flavor with the {*scratch*} because it pays
It's written by the groceries, or should I say the veggies
Come over here fair maiden, allow me to pull the wedgie
From the baggy pants you're wearin, excuse me for starin
You've got a very nice rear I hope you don't mind sharin
A minute to get to know me, I'm sure you will adore me
So walk and talk with me cause every freckle has a story
I'm showin that this is, fact and not fictitious
Lend me your ear, ba-bay, cause I'm your poetry man
I make it alright, youknowhatI'msayin?
I'll be your guidin light your superstar but only if you let me be him
So while you think it over I'll be rockin to the P.M

{*DJ Fuse scratches: "Yo Piano Man", "rock rock on"*}
{*Shock G, a.k.a. the Piano Man, does his keyboard thang*}

Well like I said I'm a poet like a painter with a palette
Of styles, ahhhhh, which one shall it be?
A def freestyle?  I'm not dissin
This one's for partyin, word to your guardian
So be it moms, pops, or your grannie
I'm non-stoppin and clockin, crazy fanny
So hand me, nuff respect, cause it's a must have
Cause I can bust ass, cut you like a mustache
Put you in the headlock, send your butt to Bedrock
Yabba-dabba-dooin, so I suggest you don't be screwin
Around with this you thought you was gonna be down with this?
When donkeys fly, guy
I'm the type of person that your mama always wanted you to be
MC M-O-N-E-Y dash B see
It's a crime to hear your rhyme you thought worthwhile
But yo, you got a style like Private Pyle
Surprise surprise surprise, Gomer
Like Canseco, I take no, and still be hittin homers
Especially when the pitch of the key, as bein thrown to me
Hittin the spot and it rocks'n'rolls and yo Hob
Keynote has gotta be the Piano Man

{*DJ Fuse scratches: "Yo Piano Man", "rock rock on"*}
{*Shock G, a.k.a. the Piano Man, does his keyboard thang*}

Take me to the bridge, but don't cross-over!

{*Fuse scratches, Shock G keeps rockin the ivories*}

The Piano Man, abbreviated it's the P.M
And when he plays, believe me that's what you'll say when you see him
Operatin on the ebonies and ivories beside me pride
No lie I kid you not the man is live, G
He receives me like a huge gulp of Gatorade
He rips it up and later on gets paid
So make the most of this, cut yourself a piece of the rug
And grab a cutie, and grab the booty, real slow
Because, I know you can I know you can can yes you can can
Oh why can't you?  It's easy to dance to
The P.M. not a wax museum, so stop posin
If you're frozen, he'll break the ice cause he's nice
And twice, the fun when Money Fuse get loose
Pourin it on like a bucket of gin and orange juice
Raw Fusion, puttin the Piano Man on display
And this is the way he gets loose

{*time for more Piano Man flava funk*}

And while the Piano Man is wreckin it, I want y'all to check it
Ronice, take us home sweetie

{*while he plays, she sings "Piano Man play your thing" and ad libs*}
{*eventually Fuse joins in for some scratching*}
{*this goes on 'til it's over at seven minutes, two seconds - FUNKY!*}[Money B]
Everybody rides the expressway of life
Man expressway is not like the best way
Why even bother they say?  But I'm tryin my luck
In the bumper to bumper, and I get stuck
In the traffic, but the ride didn't last that long
'fore I tripped, and figured somethin must be wrong
With the rat race, feels like I'm comin in last place
Then I looked behind me, kinda reminds me
Of fish swimmin up the stream in a pack
And like a pair of spandex you gets no slack
From the autos, cause the rush hour's upon us
Can you dig it yeah that's what I thought

[break and hook]
So can I get a beep beep?  {*beep beep*}  (Money blow your horn..)
When I feel sometimes that I'm stuck, "Stuck in a traffic jam!"
I keep on, but I can't slow down
That's when I know that I'm stuck, "Stuck in a traffic jam!"
And beep beep, goes the sound
When I know that I'm stuck, "Stuck in a traffic jam!"
I keep on, but I can't slow down
That's when I know that I'm stuck, "Stuck in a traffic jam!"
And beep beep, goes the sound, of the traffic jam

{*DJ Fuse scratches up "jam" samples*}

[Money B]
Checkin out the fast lane, cruisin in the slow lane
Brothers in the fast lane seem to have no brain
He's in the cocaine white Maserrati
With the big engine and the kitted out body
Lookin real fancy and he loves the power
Everybody's on the jock, he lives every hour
Kinda reckless, but I should expect this, cause he got on
At the ghetto entrance, right?
Cruise towards a better part of town
At a breakaway speed, I wish he'd slow down
As he passed me he asked me to roll with him
But if I roll with him then I gotta pay the toll with him
If another fast car, with a big engine
Takes him out, cause fast cars be sendin
Other fast cars to the wrecking yard
Yeah, fast lane life is hard

[break and hook]

{*DJ Fuse scratches up "jam" samples*}

[Money B]
Movin along, I use my right turn signal
Spot a commotion so I roll down my window
A beemer is smashed, by a cock diesel
Truck, who says so what, because he's so
Fed up, with seein, the rich just cruisin
By so fly while he's fightin a losin
Battle with life as a blue collar workin truck
But nobody really gives a damn
So I am what I am, he says to himself
Cause he can't visualize attainin the wealth
That he deserves so he swerves as the pressure drops
I think he's gettin off at the next stop
And check out Ronda, over there in the Honda
From around the way, she says that she's kinda
Sick of it all, so she gives us a sob story
Wishin that she had a paint job
She'll do just fine with the nice white hood
Cause in this kinda traffic, the black's no good
For a vehicle, here we go again
I guess that the grass looks greener for the whites
To some black cars, by far, this has been a long day
I hope that I haven't been goin the wrong way
I keep on, to the early morn
With both hands close to my horn
So can I get a beep beep?  {*beep beep*}  (Money blow your horn..)
When I feel sometimes that I'm stuck  (When I feel sometimes..)
That I'm out of luck when I'm stuck, "Stuck in a traffic jam!"
I keep on, but I can't slow down
That's when I know that I'm stuck, "Stuck in a traffic jam!"
And beep beep, goes the sound
When I know that I'm stuck, "Stuck in a traffic jam!"
I keep on, but I can't slow down
That's when I know that I'm stuck, "Stuck in a traffic jam!"
And beep beep, goes the sound, of the traffic jam

{*DJ Fuse scratches up "jam" samples*}
{*"jamming" ad libs to the end*}This is a love song 	(3x)

A love for the revolution

[ VERSE 1: Money B ]
1951
Francis was brung
Into this world
The cutest little girl
That you ever wanna see
Big brown eyes and her hair was just as curly as it wanna be
She was her parent's pride and joy
And at the age 14 she was chased by every boy
In the neighborhood
Who was up to no good
Her daddy told her 'no', but Francis thought she could
Do whatever she wanted to do
She was independent and cool, but she wasn't a fool
Cause when you're poor, you gotta go for self
Everyday's a hustle, and you gotta protect your wealth
Reality wasn't pleasant
And at sweet 16, she was eight months pregnant
Her parents didn't approve, she had to move on her own
And around the way she was known
As

Wild, Wild Francis
Wild, Wild, Wild Francis
Wild, Wild Francis
Wicked, wicked, wicked Francis
Wild, Wild Francis
Rough, rough, rough Francis
Wild, Wild Francis
Wicked, wicked Francis

[ VERSE 2: Money B ]
Two yeas passed, at last 1969
18 years old and grown refined
Francis with a healthy baby boy
She wasn't doin good, but she was employed
At the neighborhood liquor sto'
Bein po' she had to make a livin, but she wanted mo'
Sho', cause back in the community
All she knew was poverty and police brutality
Francis wasn't scared of no one
But afraid of what might happen to her young son
You see, the ghetto's filled with pitfalls
And if you start slippin and trippin, there's not much hope at all
But she heard about a group of blacks with guns
They were prepared and not scared to fight back and attack
For people like you and me
To make life better in the poor black community
Like a free breakfast program
Cause it was proof, the government never gave a damn
About blacks, they rather see em die in hell
"They cause problems, let em all have sickle cell"
But this party started a free clinic
So when the people got sick, they got help quick
They even had plans for a school later
Francis read it, cause the party had their own paper
She knew this was her life's calling
It was time for revolution, and Francis was all in
Before she quit, she told the boss what she was gonna do
And all he said was, "They were right when they called you..."

Wild, Wild Francis
Wild, Wild, Wild Francis
Wicked, wicked Francis
Rough, rough, rough Francis
Wild, Wild Francis
Wild, Wild, Wild Francis
Wicked, wicked, wicked Francis
Wild, Wild, Wild Francis

[ VERSE 3: Money B ]
Francis, Francis, a full-fledged soldier
A member of the party with a chip on her shoulder
Startin down the road of revolution
Beginning with the work of Mao-Tse Tung, Karl Marx and Lenin
This group was following a communist plan
Spearheaded by a ten-point platform and program
Statin what they wanted (freedom) and what they believed (equality)
Like the power to control their own destiny
And the necessities, land, bring
Education, housing and clothing, and it was no thing
To pick up the gun and see to
An immediate end to the murder of the people
They were full of rebellions, well, this
Attracted the attention of government intelligence
One night there was a meeting down at headquarters
It was the night the police gave orders
They knew one day it would happen
They were prepared, clips were picked up and snapped in
Posts were manned, and that's when Fran took a stand
With no fear, her gun gripped tight in hand
Smoke bombs came through the window
They were soldiers, and they weren't about to give in, so
Gunshots rang out, pigs got blown up
The party was wreckin shit, but more cops showed up
The police were tough, and when the smoke cleared
Fran laid in a puddle of red stuff
With the rest of her party comrads
And at the funeral her son, mom and dad
Cried and cried, but what's to do when
A life is lost for the love of the revolution
Now that's what romance is
Rest in peace...

Wild, Wild
Wild, Wild
Wild, Wild Francis
Wild, Wild, Wild Francis
Rough, rough, rough Francis
Bad, bad, bad Francis
Wild, Wild Francis
Wild, Wild, Wild Francis
Wicked, wicked, wicked Francis
Wild, Wild, Wild Francis

This is a love song 	(3x)
