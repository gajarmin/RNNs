[Joell Ortiz]
Joey what you said, 24 right
Aight cool, I got you
I define gutter - every time I rhyme
I climb up another notch, hip-hop got my spine smothered
But I'll be fine brother - my mind hovers
Above all you jive suckers wishing, that's word to my mother
You throw a shot at me, I'm throwing a shot back
Yours is on a joint, mine's whistling by your top hat
Yeah, I'm cool but you violate and I'll cock back
Open the mac's mouth and black out like I do not rap
I'm sick and tired of niggas lying
They fifth is lying in the second drawer next door to some bullshit they iron
Y'all be making up stories the little kids is buyin'
I do everything my Penn State like a Nittany Lion
I ain't gotta mention the streets on a song
To get in a nigga ass on these beats like a thong - pause
Veterans co-sign me, the up-and-comers scared
The pretty girls go, "papi, here's my underwear"
Never in a hundred years I thought I'd be a rapper
But in less than a hundred bars I knew I'd be a factor
I'm PS4 in HD and the screen is plasma
You're Atari 2600 with a weak adapter
Between us the gap's so crazy
I'm Gucci, Louis V; you're Gap, Old Navy
I get coochie in the V, you attract no ladies
You're suburb, I'm gutter where the gats go crazy

[Nino Bless]
Fuck a lecture, ain't tryna be Pun's successor
That term's done fucker, what up whatever
You birds is food, I'm about to pluck some feathers
I'm young and clever, plus clutch under pressure, yup
Who does this better
Walk around with metal all on me like the front of Shredder
I lust for cheddar you owe me
Leave holes in your vest that'll open your chest like a sunken treasure
I'm somethin' like a phenomenon
Dropping bombs for fun then dine in Hell during Ramadan
Whatever I'm rhyming on or whoever
I tear 'em apart; swear on my pops
No, fear in my heart, shit been through it all
Done swam with the sharks, snapped fins with my jaws
I'm all that and a bag of the baddest piff
Off of a brick of hash mixed with acid hits like sick cracker shit
Get back, dumb birds I ignore the hype
Click-clack, Yung Berged if you flossing ice
Dawg, cross me twice, can't afford the price
It'll cost you, I'll off your life
You soft, I told you I'm raw white when I'm on this mic
Still mourn at night, don't wanna see mornin' light
And I feel like I'm forced to fight
When the +Chips+ are down like Ponch fallin' off his bike
Of course my metaphors are type awesome, right
I got 'em in awe, my aura's Jordan like
What's really poppin', who diddy-boppin
You wasn't really, now you all Common and really conscious
I ain't with that silly nonsense, I really pop shit
My gun stay cocked like Biggie's optics
I stay evolving but grown bitter
On your grave they're carvin', "fucked with the wrong nigga"

[Crooked I]
I don't write I kill a pen, leak its blood on the page
I breathe bars like oxygen locked my lungs in a cage
Instrumentals get fucked on the stage
A pedophile unless I dig in the crates and fuck with somethin' my age
Forever vow, to never smile when I'm at peace
Only when I'm eating the deceased like quiche
Only when my enemy's internal organs are a smorgasbord in a feast
The Dahmer with melanin led 'em in the belly of the beast
You'll be missin' until fishermen see your corpse
I'll be in Michigan sticking a chicken in my Michelin
Ready to pigeon pitch again from Switzerland to New York
I was whipping Bentleys before them pictures up in The Source
I'm a gorillas behind these bars, on some zoo shit
Shoot you while you're talking on some news camera crew's shit
Sicker than flyin' in past tense on some flu shit
Day-old asshole flow, I drop new shit
Exclusive, you don't want it in fact
I'll have the doctors operating on the front of your back
Tryna keep your stomach intact
The spiritual you, leavin your body, he don't wanna go back
That's when the tunnel go black
I send your soul to the atmosphere
Fuck outta here and your ringtone rap career
It's Crooked I, the face of Eastside Long Beach
Put your ear to the street so you can hear my heartbeat

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Nickel, yeah
I hope niggas know I'll show up to your show
I'll show up where you go, show up to your do', fo's will explode
Shells 'fore they hit the floor, I know niggas know
I got a open window flow, I air shit out
In the D they used to call me Mayor Royce
Now they call me Clay Davis
Guess why, "sheeeeeeeeeeee-it"
Cause when it come to them words you know I wear shit out
I write rhymes like, white lines on a nose tray
Ice cold Ice Cube flow like O'Shea
Ridin' shotgun with Chris Martin my DJ
Not the White boy, but I'm down for the +Coldplay+
Forever stay violent, better stay silent
Hammers stay humming like strumming the mandolin violin
Speaking of, I done played a tune of violence
More than my nigga Charles Hamilton played Sonic
I wrap niggas up, clap niggas up, scrap niggas up
Either that or we gon' slap niggas up
Dump dirt on you right before I go
Into my Maino mode if I smell the scent of Yung Berg on ya
Til it ain't no mo', ain't no dough
Get into his ass cause I ain't opposed, I'm a livin' anal probe
I'm a lame-ophobe, matter fact my nigga JumpOff
Can I keep goin' (why the fuck not)
When I was a teen, I used to pack a three-eighty
Now I'm spittin sittin' between Shady and Jay
I pull the jeans down on my bitch and then wave
Cause the pussy Max B wavy when she ain't shave
I leave the booth smellin' like somebody ain't sprayed
I would talk about Kimbo but I ain't crazy
I'm like Marty McFly goin' back in time
And dissin' his momma nigga you can't fade me

[Joe Budden]
They say he a bastard for real, then they see the ass on his girl
So they wonderin', why's he so mad at the world
I take it out on tracks, I R.I.P. it
So even to the producer it's hard to I.D. it
Bars tremendous, it's in your best interest
I insist your men just, do your best Bush rendish
Endless, move more than two inches
My blood'll boil like I got a big skin cyst
So end this or see me mañana
Or see the speed of a llama, underground prima donna
That ain't hard to find, pop a E in a Honda
With hands like E. Honda, he a monster
I love war, it's like my pet peeve kinda
But for us to even beef you should be honored
My dick gettin' hard, I see vagina - pause
Nah, rewind each line each time
Speak mine and meet nine, mano-a-mano
When it rains it pours, grab a teflon poncho
You now fuckin' with Mouse, the head honcho
Nigga I could fit your house in my condo
I walk around like ratchets been legalized
Just me and the Desert Eagle, and an eagle eye
Closed casket, now you having a boxed wake
Zipper over your head, dudes callin' you Crotchface
So y'all could bump "Swag Like Us"
But the next time rap's discussed, add this as a plus
Don't nobody hit the pad like us
And would get up in that ass but the fag's might bust
And since poppin' tags is a must
I hit the bank all I do is withdraw
Chicks removin' their drawers now, your crew is in awe
How you ball, your jewels from a cubicle in the mall
You gon' need another processor, to process it
I'll set it, I said it
So keep running around hot-headed, 'til you get hot leaded
Til everything but your torso on you is prosthetic
Digest it, niggas is pie-thetic
Rap what you can't afford, y'all must got credit
All you gotta know is Crooked I, Royce, Bless and Joell
With Joe spell, NO L[INRO]

It ain't nothin' like hip hop music
It ain't nothin' like hip hop music
It ain't nothin' like hip hop music
You all know how the story go![Kung-fu sample]
Master!
*sounds of fighting*
Toad style.. hmmph
The Shaolin deliberately tried to use the Lord
To learn our Wu-Tang sword fighting!
The Shaolin would never do that!
Wouldn't you? The Shaolin have always looked down at us
Are you afraid the Wu-Tang would become more famous than you?
You?
So you used your Shaolin poison to set up my master and deliberately frame me!
That's nonsense!
It's not nonsense! I saw it myself!
Nonsense! The Shaolin have nothing to fear from the Wu-Tang but our swordfight

[Intro: Raekwon]
Aiyo! Come on! Let go of the ratchet, son, come on, let's go! Come on!

[Raekwon]
Villagers, gangstas, pillagers, paintbrush
New whips, blue fifths, Louis Shallah, bitch
Ostrich turtlenecks, the Chef, already reps
Lean off the petty jets, we buy the very best
Outfits, powerful rich, pouncers, camel clips
One bump, two lumps, the shotgun, the new jumps
With flying bird, buying herb, new kick, designer birds
She on, and we up, let's re-up, and free'd up
Jakes hate it, Rae made it, Clientele, we gon' sell
You gon' starve, he gon' jail, night boots, swim with whales
Better snub, surgical leather gloves, never loved
We gon' kill, take it to the Hill, we forever real
Old records, old luggage, you ill with no rugged
You shoot and we spray, kill off them old buzzards
We love it, can't stand it, you hid, the The Wu Manual
We found it, stay grounded, we will, we still scrambling

[Kung-fu sample]
Hold your fire!
You two traitors!
You've mixed the Shaolin and Wu-Tang
No, we have not, it's just that they're the same
That's right, my Lord
You misunderstand our kung-fu work
It doesn't belong to anybody, IT EVOLVES!
Kill 'em!

[Raekwon]
The wrist lifter, the grave sitter, babysitter
The jar twister, open the vault, call your sister
The Pyrex, the up in the five, live as Twister
Blunt rolling, only a robe on, some whiskers
Knee slapper, the gat packer, blackjacker
Extortionist, friendly as shit, Bob and Back-lur
Ones folder over the stove, gold rover
The gear dresser, the chop bagger, Marvin Haggler
Rap stabber, eat you alive, gold tarantula
Sixteen paces and shit, hold the heckler
Pimp style, Axel Foley, stolen Rolly
All ya niggas that know me, ya'll owe me

[Kung-fu sample]
I don't give a damn! Listen
Hahaha, And I'll kill anyone, who dares to go against...(Yes I did... I made a mistake... yes I did)

Huh..ya know living this type a life
Makes you grow up faster than you'd expect to sometimes...
Fuck around and be in your late twenties...
Feelin like a old man and shit...
Yeah for real son... let em know

It's hard to breath and hard to run when your lung's blackened
Coughing up blood like what the fuck happened
Raising my risk of cancer's the answer homie
But after drinking something there's nothing like puffing a bogie
Now I can blame the same product placement in movies
Or the commercials, or Scarface in a jacuzzi
But now I'm living it
Damn I should a never took that first cigarette

(I made a mistake)

I fucked up, like your girl was riding on top of me
I should of took her to trial and never copped a plea
But this ain't a Christian nation motherfucka please
America never taught me to turn the other cheek
Cause I'm from Harlem, the north of Manhattan
We knock niggas out and make em bounce like Ricky Hatton
But wildin on the corner got me turned back from the Canadian border

(I made a mistake)

I knew she was a virgin, when I first met her
Rockin stockings and poppin out of the catholic school sweater
Mom told her she could do better than a criminal
Seventeen year-old psychotic, trying to be lyrical
I never meant to break her heart or fuck up her life
But I was careless, instead of treating her right
I seen her again at some club strippin and wondered
If I could have made her life different

(I made a mistake... yes I did... )

[Tech talking over the beat:
Damn shortie, you got me on some singin the blues shit...
But you gotta stop looking backwards and remember to look ahead...
This is for all my dudes on patrol in the desert right now... for real]

(I made a mistake)

Yeah..yeah... I joined the army looking for money to go to college
But they ain't pay me a quarter of what they fucking promised
Extended my tour, treating me like a sucker
That's the reason officers get fragged motherfucker
Don't give me speeches on how you respect and you love me
But no body armor in a lightly armored humvee?!
My family's lonely and you want me to reenlist for 30 grand homie?

(I made a mistake)

When I was young I got signed to a record label
The deal looked so good when it was on the table
It paid for my cable, cribs, cars and jewelry
The studios, the women there's nothing they wouldn't do for me
Except stop screwing me for publishing and royalties
How the fuck are you my dawg, when there's no loyalty?
Word to the street
I should've gone independent like Immortal Technique

(I made a mistake)

Some people learn from mistakes and don't repeat them
Others try to block the memories and just delete them
But I keep em as a reminder they not killing me
And I thank God for teaching me humility
Son, remember when you fight to be free
To see things how they are and not how you like em to be
Cause even when the world is falling on top of me
Pessimism is an emotion, not a philosophy
Knowing what's wrong doesn't imply that you right
And its another, when you suffer to apply it in life
But I'm no rookie
And I'm never gonna make the same mistake twice pussy[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Dressed in FILA, change in the beehive
7:30 nigga slick coupe with him, see ma?
I'm rich, my bitch, before and after, kept her well
Sit right there, enjoy the chapter
Bounce, 2 ounces get burnt
Thinkin' bread now, buy more lead, get the dread town
Let's smoke on the furlough king
Switch to Merlot, I know them niggas is bird, they swerve dope
Nobody gettin' it, whores is wicked with it
Little kids growin' up fast, teens is wickeded
No jobs, no checks, it's like rockin' an Olex
Rolex, her father is Cotex
Mother is so vexed, brothers is on X
Niggas is slummin' it, I'd rather see no necks
Dumb niggas, this the decade of bum niggas
It won't work, no matter how much bread you jerk

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
Inhale it (x3)
Weed so loud, all my neighbors say they hear it
Roll up the strong, inhale it (x3)
Weed so loud, all my neighbors say they hear it

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
I'm usually in the lawsuits frontin'
Comin' out Bank of America, big knot on me, I'm comfy
Roll the joints, jumpin' in joints, niggas with coins beat the point
And we want appointments, yo nigga, get some ointment
Stop playin', start prayin', I just might start sprayin'
Niggas is ass and all day with it
No style with no pals, niggas is so foul
It shows how I only fuck with real, them niggas know now
I slow down, don't wanna catch a charge and go down
I'm too large, drop a bag, use a marksman
Pause, said, "You don't want no parts of me, kid"
I'm just shootin' you real rap, so go wash with it
A legend with his hands up, suits is glammed up
I'm just bowlin' for millions out in Japan, what
Plannin' somethin', niggas ride around wearin' somethin'
Other than that or rap, I'd rather fade black

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
These niggas is dead already, I use machetes to eat spaghetti
They really couldn't ride a mile on my Pirellis
Bags so heavy the damns collapsed
Conversate about me, that's a chain reaction
Pressure to press in past aggression
Hope your body guard got pain protection
One in the chamber, middle finger, no fornicate
So many bullets in the clip, it's 'bout to sufficate
My uncle was late, my aunt ain't show up
How you gon' tell an old man to grow up
It's like comparin' Earl to throw up
Same frame of mind but a different poster
I'm 'posed to be what I wanna be
Dream so big for the world to see
First class, fruits and tea
And usually the only black man is me

[Hook][Intro]
Did he have hands?
Did he have a face?
Yes
Then it wasn't us

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Bernard Goetz Gazelle's on
.45 in the bag, mask a Bourdon
Sacks Willy jury is all really
Rich nigga's paying for the team
Sniff the eighth and feed Lily
Lily is a cocaine Willy
Who got mad connects in a small town in Philly
Octopus soul sister rock a puss
Ghost outside parked vertical
Yeah, the Jakes'll murder you
Four to five hundred bricks
Dicks come in with no tie on
That symbolizes the wire on
All Krylon heat my rings bling
500 feet away
Hit the church steeples in the D
Brand new shells on
A python, a Fisker
Twist from the Astons
Made for the listener
Or rather yeah, the driver
Suicide rider
B bums and Wally's
Me and Shallah's colleagues

[Chorus]
4 in the morning [8x]

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Blow hands, the stove is a roaster
Where bottles whip in motion
May cause 'drop him in the ocean'
Irish blood gangsters, the roulettes
Cooler moving through Texas
Grandmother she Mex-ish, yup
Tablets, krills, bath salts, last call, get it
Drugs flying minutes like a fastball
Smash all, I will remain clean, the status calm
I do it for niggas who last long
Last Don's chill
Kings in the chair, cigars in the air
This the last part with snakes that'll break any mans arm
Which way the grass growin'
We've sown enough and now we're farmers
Who come through with lawn mowers and armor

[Chorus]
4 in the morning [8x]

[Verse 3: Ghostface Killah]
Yeah, I used to move cracks
Sort diesel and gats
Runnin' trains on them hood rat bitches up in the trap
We used to blow 'em out
Fiends comin' in hike with they seized bite
With residue stuck all on they pipe
4 in the mornin' when the gates start jumpin'
Dustheads lurkin' and the fiends start thumpin'
And it seems like the fiends, he own CREAM, so they jumpin'
Bean told Cream he stole green so he cut ‘em
Ditch him Star, souflee'd one half of his cheekbone
Now he talkin' out the side of his mouth
But yo, peep homes, stuck
Fly dust, that's four finger nuggets
With plastic stuffed in the Kangol buckets
Dirty burners on, gloves and scanners
Smart mouth, Teymor bitches in the back gettin' sandwiched
After a dick suck accountant
In the wee hours, backing up mountains
4 in the morning

[Chorus]
4 in the morning [8x][Intro]
I'm gon' ride, I'm gon' ride
They gon' ride, we all gon' ride

I've come from the heart of South Side
Holdin' it down for my niggas that died
I gotta busy bird on my side
Pop shit and get your whole mouth wired

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Baby had tried to steal off the payroll
I'll have niggas scrappin' the skin off yo face
With the same shit they peel the potatoes
I thank the Lord for my blessings and I'm glad he gave us
The willpower and reflexes of Larry Davis
You don't wanna see my block formin'
That's a hundred and one doggs
And I don't mean the ones with the spots on 'em
We're respected highly
Cause you don't need to practice gymnastics to catch a body
Me and money's like Whitney, next to Bobby
If I bring all my niggas, I'll need an extra lobby
As soon as you ain't around jake
You get your ass whipped for chips
Now that's the real definition of poundcake
I got the crown, snake, and you can tell when I'm shopping
Cause when the mall stampedin', you feel the ground shake
I got a car I only drive on Thursdays
I'm a stunna, Banks blows more cake than birthdays

[Hook: Lloyd Banks] x2
Look at here, ain't nobody 'round here scared
I'm headin' for the top and I'm almost there
Oh yeeuh, this shiny shit right here
I'll work magic and make you niggas disappear

[Verse 2: Young Buck]
You know how I gets down, this pound holds six rounds
I told ya I'd be back bitch, talk that shit now!
You hear that fo'-fif sound; duck when I spit rounds
Cause this ain't Beverly Hills; you in the bricks now
We ain't got shit down here but dope and guns for sale
You get your head cracked and niggas don't run and tell
It's like we sell crack, get caught, head back to jail
We on that "fuck the police" shit, we livin' in hell
You better guard your grill homey and stand your ground
These bullets burn, they hit whoever's standin' around
I never learn, even after I took a couple shots
I just got me some Band-Aids and bought a couple Glocks
Had to go on a rampage and hit a couple blocks
Once they hear that 12-gauge, that's when the trouble stops
If it's beef, then I'm ready to ride
Just come to Cashville, you can find me on the South Side
Motherfucker

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
Now I ain't from Michigan but I'm in the Fab Five
You know, Yayo and 50, Buck and Game, you know my fuckin' name
Whether the truck or train, my mind's stuck on the grind
Cause somewhere down the line, a lot of suckers came
Yeah, ain't talkin' shit but we can all tell he ass
Jabs will black his eyes like the R. Kelly mask
You gotta blast me, yo, cause the Louisville
Will have yo head lookin' like the top of a pistachio
The young gunner with a raspy flow
Got every boyfriend thinkin' their girlfriend's a nasty ho
My heart laughin' it's small
Maybe it's cause my grandpop dropped right after the ball
Banks hops out, bulletproof this, bulletproof that
Bulletproof snorkel, when you hot they hawk you
I got the hood on my shoulder
Chain big as a boulder
The 3-5-7 tucker
Motherfucker

[Hook]

Yeeuh, haha
Motherfucker
I'm here... yeeuh
Lloyd Banks!
G-G G-G G-G G-G G-G G-Unit!
Money by any means... nigga[Verse One] [Saigon]:
If I cock the biscuit, somebody gettin' a doctor visit
Listen to 2Pacalysm, flippin' how 'Pac predicted
A young death but still optimistic
My survival instinct will make me go rob the district
Spit an ox get a grip, rip you from your eyelid to lip with the bitter tip
Your shit will drip a lot more than a little bit
Your scar pa?
Uh huh, you will never get rid of it
Not even laser surgery will conceal your disfigurement
Stupid head, my niggas will mark you for dead
Pop lead, watch the hollow head slug particle spread
Sorry savage I'll introduce you to body baggage
Have the new body maggots eat you like crab ?
Y'all rappers is average my status miraculous
From Paris to where ever my dad is
I embarrass the bad
He pathetic, he inherited weak genetics
P alphabetics, fill it to speed at 1,120 feet per second
Makes a part of my fate to scar the Tri-State
Y'all niggas get ate, broke down to a carbohydrate
Saigon, Scram Jones
He violate, I ain't gon' make no damn poem
I'mma break that man bone

[Verse Two] [Nino Bless]:
Look I'm nice when I spit
I don't care if you got hype and you rich
I got the illest MC's rewritin' they shit
You and me?
It's like comparing a four star to a deli
Belly to Goodfellas or Hoodfellas to Biggie
B.I.G.'s flow to Diddy's
Or comparin' the 'burbs crime rate to the south side of any city
Or Yayo to 50's
Lil' Wayne's wordplay to Pun's dead-in-the-middle-of-Little-Italy scheme
Lyrically you ain't fit for the game
You ain't shit, I mean literally, you a walkin' shit stain
Talkin' like you did things
You not the gangsta, you just tell they story like Ving Rhames
And now we ain't the same, you and I sonny
Since I've been on, who took the light from me?
You nice? Get it right dunny
I've been dope since 'Pac was sportin' a Gumby dancin' behind Humpty
So this rap shit is light money
I hustle whatever the weather, whether it's night, sunny
I'm here movin' anything that brings dough
You can tell I hustle, I cop everything with singles
And I done been so broke totin' a fifth, locin' for chips
No angle, no hope to get rich
So lay low nigga, watch how you approachin' a spic
I'll clip the halo off the angel watchin' over you bitch
You niggas don't want it, don't even try
Get your weight up homie, you under size
Nino Bless, Scram Jones and Sai
Throw Crooked I in the mix and this alliance is sick

[Verse Three] [Scram Jones]:
I'm sick as scarlet fever, spittin' bars with ether
For the none believers, I'mma put it down like some carpet cleaner
In my Nature, gettin' pussy with my father's features
I'm not a player but get brains like a Harvard teacher
While these rappers are just cartoons like Bart and Lisa
All they do is bubble a little like Orangina
I've been doin' this since Mistadoblina
Way before the beef between Fif' and Don Cartagena
Before the haterade never used to taste the shade
Now dudes will cut you like they play Spades with razorblades
I'm at the airport changing clocks like Flava Flav
Still I love New York more than Tailor Made
Give NY power cause dudes is type coward
So I'mma put a cape on my back like Dwight Howard
Too busy shoppin' the tracks I couldn't take the time out
Watchin' dudes cop more crack than Amy Winehouse
Now I'm in the stoop, cookin' somethin' awful
And I ain't gonna stop till we pop and we all full
So we cuttin' up the pizza make the dough fast
Keep the money in the freezer, all we want is cold cash
The beat peddler in the street sector
Known to speak clever and rip like cheap leather
They say he a movie, more like the director
On the mic I O.D. like Heath Ledger

[Crooked I talking]:
It's your boy Crooked
C.O.B

[Verse Four] [Crooked I]:
Idiot W's up with my thumb cuffed
Must I stick my dick in a dumb slut
Just to illustrate you a dumb fuck?
A young buck
Me and my guns love struck
Get hit with the Magnum like Enter The Dragon nun chucks
Noon chucks, soon as the moon's up
Me and my platoon movin', assume that it's boom's up
With the .45's I carry, I bury my adversaries
Like lies buried in the library
See I'm sick as a witchdoctor
Pickin' which Glock to click pop ya
Sick as script written by Hitchcock
Or lyrics gettin' spit by Big Poppa
Leave a vic hoffa, stick me, I drip Vodka
Fo' fif' cocker
I'm a clique shocker/Chaka
Zulu, stickin' my chest out like a chick's knockers
Bitch, I spit lava
And I rock enough ice to entice a slick robber
But nigga you gets nada
All you get is murdered then dressed in a silly disguise
Since you a clown, it's a fitting demise
Yeah Crooked calls shots man, wigs can goosh
I don't know how fiction looks, just the licks, the jooks
The accountant to fix the books
The foot soldiers to push prescription kush
We just like the system; crooks
So fuck the cops and the warden
I spit for my niggas to make history like when Iverson crossed over Jordan[Verse 1: Ea$y Money]
We go hard when we play the sport
Supreme/sue Preme like we took the DJ to court
You not built for rap, when will you discover?
My dawgs break weed up on your disc cover
Mean rhymes on deck like the dealer's hand
But we still take work out the dealer's hand
This pack a 1000 short, oh you stealing grams?
Some loss happened to grandma, kill a gram/kilogram
Flow butter, your man is on the road
Strapped like Lamar, mean handle on the phone
Don't be flossin' when my clan on patrol
They gon' catch a vic/Vick, animal control
Flow with no pen still eat a nigga writin'
Rhymes sick, these bars need a liquor license
Take shots for the squad you can get the same
Team I'm down for/four like a two possession game

[Verse 2: Scram Jones]
Ayo I used to hold a Visa with no stash
Now I keep my doe up in the freezer, cause all I want is cold cash
Get caught up in agree get your throat slash
But who am I to even teach when I got no class?
From the horses mouth that's why I can't act stable
Just a dog that's known to go and rock a cat's cradle
I'm in Vegas trippin', drinkin' on black label
In the casino slippin', shittin' on a crap table
Oh no habits, Bozo status, bang a Ralph Lauren's daughter on a Polo mattress
I told her, "swallow your pride and suck it up."
And shoot a load to the ceiling, bitch I'm cummin' up
Ain't shit change, beats is steady knockin'
So when chicks give me brain I make sure the heads is bobbin'
Pound the speaker, pounds of reefer
You keep it 100, I keep it 3000, Jeter

[Verse 3: Termanology]
Stat' crazy with the beats, T crazy with the flows
Just like Watch The Throne if Jay and them was broke
We from from the bottom
Yep yep the bottom
Down here where the soil might be
I'm Diallo
Uh
No gun
But they open fire
Uh
So fun
Ralph Lo attire
? is drunk, I'm burnin' tires
Flier than the fliest fly, floatin' through fire
I'm in the Chevy Caprice, with four G's
In the south where I got gone for four Gs/4Gs
Not the phone, I mean four Gs
The only other PR cat or Ortiz
Not Dave or Tito
But I'm the champ
Little water and some trees, I'm the camp
I put my hands in the atmosphere
Showoff laughs some of the best rappers here

[Verse 4: Wais P]
Still nicer than Cam Newton, my man's shootin'
What up rookie, got a whole season you need provin'
What's the reason, spit raps like a nigga teethin'
My right hand asthmatic, leave a nigga weezin'
50 karats on my chest got my nipples freezin'[Intro]
Did he have hands?
Did he have a face?
Yes
Then it wasn't us

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Bernard Goetz Gazelle's on
.45 in the bag, mask a Bourdon
Sacks Willy jury is all really
Rich nigga's paying for the team
Sniff the eighth and feed Lily
Lily is a cocaine Willy
Who got mad connects in a small town in Philly
Octopus soul sister rock a puss
Ghost outside parked vertical
Yeah, the Jakes'll murder you
Four to five hundred bricks
Dicks come in with no tie on
That symbolizes the wire on
All Krylon heat my rings bling
500 feet away
Hit the church steeples in the D
Brand new shells on
A python, a Fisker
Twist from the Astons
Made for the listener
Or rather yeah, the driver
Suicide rider
B bums and Wally's
Me and Shallah's colleagues

[Chorus]
4 in the morning [8x]

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Blow hands, the stove is a roaster
Where bottles whip in motion
May cause 'drop him in the ocean'
Irish blood gangsters, the roulettes
Cooler moving through Texas
Grandmother she Mex-ish, yup
Tablets, krills, bath salts, last call, get it
Drugs flying minutes like a fastball
Smash all, I will remain clean, the status calm
I do it for niggas who last long
Last Don's chill
Kings in the chair, cigars in the air
This the last part with snakes that'll break any mans arm
Which way the grass growin'
We've sown enough and now we're farmers
Who come through with lawn mowers and armor

[Chorus]
4 in the morning [8x]

[Verse 3: Ghostface Killah]
Yeah, I used to move cracks
Sort diesel and gats
Runnin' trains on them hood rat bitches up in the trap
We used to blow 'em out
Fiends comin' in hike with they seized bite
With residue stuck all on they pipe
4 in the mornin' when the gates start jumpin'
Dustheads lurkin' and the fiends start thumpin'
And it seems like the fiends, he own CREAM, so they jumpin'
Bean told Cream he stole green so he cut ‘em
Ditch him Star, souflee'd one half of his cheekbone
Now he talkin' out the side of his mouth
But yo, peep homes, stuck
Fly dust, that's four finger nuggets
With plastic stuffed in the Kangol buckets
Dirty burners on, gloves and scanners
Smart mouth, Teymor bitches in the back gettin' sandwiched
After a dick suck accountant
In the wee hours, backing up mountains
4 in the morning

[Chorus]
4 in the morning [8x][VERSE 1: Joell Ortiz]

[VERSE 2: Scram Jones]

[VERSE 3: Nino Bless]
Baby there's a shark in the water
Named BLESS, upstaging the top performers
Was there from the start of the slaughter
When I go off like a shot from a sawed off, this was the cocked warning, sort off*
Eh eh eh, hands off this shit
I'll off you, QUICK as the black dude in a horror flick
This, artist spits SARS every song I rip
Got fans coming out the blue like some former Crips
I'm from the corner strip, that’s lawless
You be an informant, eating lunch with officers feeding the sergeant tips
HEART, of a martyr, shit these bars I spit
Are like folks related fucking, they just come out retarded kid*
I'm guarded with an arm looking like cable in the X Force
You less than a pawn, you a checkers piece on my chessboard
N.I.N.O, real heads know
I go, harder than acid trippers bopping to techno (whoa)

[VERSE 4: Grafh][Noreaga]
[Ayo aki man, I want a turkey and cheese man "oil and vinegar"
Hold the tomatoes Bee, extra mayonase yall niggas be cheap on the mayonase
And I'mma take some chips and this muthafucking Sunkist I'll pay you later]

Yeaa!! See I don't see eye to eye with niggas
I kill em fast I ain't gotta say goodbye to niggas
Noreaga the office is a bodega
Ask pancho hit em with the hancho
All I really need is baking soda and the blanco
Bullet proof glass selling loosies on the late night
Got big work kind to cut it with a snake knife
The homie paco work on the morning shift
That's my man uncle put in work for a morning sniff
Yea! we done switch the whole operation
Humptu allah prey we lost to observation
They know I'm the shit but I had constipation
Right hand damaged again and I ain't lefty
Put the razor right by his chin right where his neck be
My new York niggas wolverine chlorine
Wild niggas from fort greene roll like a ball team

[Hook 2X: Noreaga]
Bodega dreams bodega nightmares
This my hood I grew up and had fights here
And you protect it so when you get arrest it
They ask you to speak without a lawyer you neglect it

[Jadakiss]
Ahaaaa!.Yo Steal it if you can't afford it
Shoot it out or either sort it
The war still gotta get reported
Coke will get snorted niggas will get slaughter
Spots get raided shut down and boughted
I really owe papi half of my stash
For letting me set shop up in the back by the trash
This here is the get back I can just kick back
Cop and go thou move traffic by the chip rack

[Sheek]
"Donnie" Na is Foxy and Mega Street Fighter or Sega
Corner store vanilla dutchy the bodega
Use to have the hammer that shoot crooked
Fell asleep drunk one night moms came home and she took it
Look it boards head turkey fiends coming thru with bootleg burkies
Tell my lil workers to chirp em
Donnie white hoody white 4 door Porsche ku klux looking
Here my source in Brooklyn

[Styles P]
Use to move C and D in the bodega
12 gauge pump nine mill and the 0 raza
Weapon by the video game never one by the cold cuts
Niggas get stretched over here for acting so tough
This our hood consider it a wolf den
Tryna run up in and fucking with a wolf then
Get a bullet in your tooth then
CNN and Lox hood niggas salute them

[Hook]

[Capone]
Aiyyo Mo from the candy store use to sell a nigga bullets
And he from Pakistan hit em with a half a gram
He get you anything no matter the gun size
Throw it in the bag with the chips and the loosies
Papi on the ave got the connect on the bootsies
A stroll outta 40th me and my nigga snoopy
Yea what up papi dimelo un minuto lets polly thou
Walk me to the basement I was startle by the rody bark
Flash the 8 on me musta thought I was from collie park
Na pa I need something that fit on my nike boot
He laughed at me in Spanish and said this will bite troops
Grab the lil 25 next to the gold riffle
This is etiquette I'm on my berretta shit gave em the bread and split
I heard that 24 got the re-up
Thats the all night store the hood ikea
You can get it all from the baggies to the leaks
Ak said is a drought come and see em in a week
Fuck that this is my hood my niggas gotta eat

[Hook][Kung fu sample]
*sounds of fighting*
Heh, do you know any other styles?
I am very grateful!
Are you ready?
I'm ready...

[Jadakiss]
Uh, down on 40 Deuce, when I was a shorty duke
That's when I first got the Naughty goose
Now I come through in a sported coupe
I know what you better do, stop talking bout what you outta do
My crack spot is still portable
Funerals are still affordable, I'm better than all of you
I'm in the hood scraping 'em, Jadakiss, Rae and 'em
Ya'll lame niggas, come uptown, spend a day with 'em
Bigger ones, bootleg liquor runs, blow something, nigga
Let the Earth smoke hit your lung, get your guns
The economy is down, so you already know
It's gon' be a lot of homi's in the town
That's why I'm still bringing the seed back
The sneakers that I can't pronounce, that cost a G stack
Niggas in the yard, got this on repeat, black
Fuck saving hip hop, we bringing the streets back, what?

[Raekwon]
Player spit snipping, different color wallies on
Bliffen had to take 'em off, they fucked up the soles, flipped it
I'm forever zooted, crushed up glass, I'm just flashing through it
Nine times out of ten, suede down at the Jumer
Maybach bloomers, playing rumors, card shark
Getting cash money, take a loan, hit this tuner
We onion head niggas, the gun gooners
Put us together, he run sea, I run land, with one ruger
Stop playing, you know we run rap, you know we done that
Stop fronting, son, put the gun back
We came with the containers, besides having the flamers
My Mexican mans is famous
Running through the streets, the bulldog
Conehead hoodies on, eighteen five for footballs
Maxed like I'm under a good wall, good G
Good recipe, good status, a hood broad

[Styles P]
I used to move brown rectangles
Roll you a blunt, then smoke you with death's angel
Chrome trey pound is making your neck dangle
Blue trey eight is leaving your chest mangled
It's math but the gun could kill you at all angles
Leave the toast home, I'm leaving you all strangled
Louis loafers on the Jaguar, gas pedals
You got the cops with you, you ain't even half ghetto
(Not even half) We neither here nor there
But if, you was over here, you would of been got aired
(Been got aired) Like a pair of white Nike's on a summer day
Pointing the gun away, I could kill you niggas a hundred ways
Minds in a place that yours ain't, so I'm wearing war paint
For the day that I see the Lord saint
Blowing the purple haze, playing The Purple Tape
Fuck with Chef or the Ghost, get left with a purple face

[Kung fu sample]
Too bad, your courage will be the death of you
*sounds of fighting*[Hook]
We pop bottles in this bitch to get our name up
I come from under the bottom nigga I came up
So many niggas surround me, wanna flame somethin'
I'm like cool out, no money here, change up
We pop bottles in this bitch to get our name up
I come from under the bottom nigga we came up
So many niggas surround me, wanna flame somethin'
I'm like cool out, no money here, change up

[Verse 1]
Little leather niggas get it
I come from the back door with 40 lil live niggas with me
All on mollys, it's nothing
Fresh niggas they up
Some in the mailroom in the club lighting blunts up
Walk through new jury, clothes is silks only
Besides galllons of milk with big bills on me
True the jewels is fluorescent
They used to light niggas who got all they shines out stretchin'
Do you in the dark, whatever come out the light
Better be bread, or weed, or gold tonight
Get to schemin' shoot the shit up with real niggas in here
They all mine as long as they know the night
Yeah that's the shit I don't like
Shawty gave me dome hype
Grab her facemask, don't bite
I'm in my mansion in the zone writin'
I'm known for throwin' lightnin'
I stand alone yo, one titan

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Post the seven in the rain
Come through with seven chains
They call me legend out in Maine
Known for tiltin' niggas wigs
Don't kill the kids for not knowin' where real rap remains
Treacherous MC, react like Jack Dempsey
Yeah the Billboard whorin' up MC
Fly as ever, one level, one rebel
Who cool out in the Cayamans with thugs, crews, and gangs
Yeah I rap for the merrier
Dance my ass off, paper chasin' Captain, America
Fly high , live as a drive-by
Team of live wires who catch you outside we fire liars
Yeah them blow kids live on the gold kids
Never go broke, grab a tote to smoke nigs
Killas know to call me to go
For murderous rap music that get inside your head it's dope

[Hook][Verse 1 - N.O.R.E.]
These moissanite fake jewelry niggas, faker than they chain
The audio, the mix show, I still obtain
Queens legend, it's Nas then it's me
Anyone that disagree I'll smack em out they misery
Sixteen years, blood, sweat, and my tears
I wanna do a last "Report" for everyone that cares
Or maybe I'm just anxious like a dude for a settlement
Maybe people don't think that CNN is relevant
It's uphill battle, when you're still rich
And your first hit date back to '96
Like that y'all, it's like that y'all
I heard ahk, I told him rep Lefrak y'all
He said wait a year or two, you ain't gotta press me
He gon' fuck hoes for free, and get a little sexy
Yeah, he was right about that
And many years later, he still right about that
Cause I'm the Lefrak king, I don't care what you say to me
Say I don't make sense, cool, that's okay with me
Same niggas wanna hang all day with me
And DJs gonna play what I play
And I could break down everything that I say
Sutter Home Moscato that I drink everyday
And I be daydreaming in the night time
Feeling like a boxer when it's fight time

[Hook x2 - Havoc]
It's a uphill battle, y'all niggas probably hang up
Uphill battle, and my niggas never changed up
Uphill battle, son they pussy and just play tough
My uphill battle, have you leaking on that pavement

[Verse 2 - Tragedy]
Fly, what I rock is murder, get indicted for what I wear
Life is beautiful, I cherish every breath of air
Disregard the past like I was never there
They try to run with my style like I was Fred Astaire
Yeah, robberies and Rovers
Bitches love Mahdi more than they love Sosa
Salute old boy OG soldier
Carrera shades on, Louis Vuitton loafers
Everything healthy, I stay fed
I hold toast, I ain't talking bout baked bread
Shake feds, no matter the odds we can make it
We been married the game, y'all still newlyweds
Militainment, 25, shit is sacred
I rock shades when my future look too bright
I rep the east, similar to Tru Life
Shit on your craps table, snake eyes, two dice
Supreme like Kenneth McGriff, all I'm seeing is green
Dirty Sprite, codeine got me on lean
For my g's with they dreams on a triple beam
Freedom ain't free but the money game mean
Fuck your swag, we super fly
And my doors commit suicide
Never fall off, QB, Top of New York
Spit flames, cocktail nigga like a Molotov
Self-made, student of the game
Killa Queens, I'm a boss, rep that at all costs

[Hook][Intro: Canibus]
Tranquility to infinity (yeah!)
Tranquility to infinity

[Canibus]
Canibus is an animal with the mechanical mandible
Coming to damage you, spitting understandable slang at you
I'm the all-seeing lyrical, with infinite bars of visuals
And a sideways eight peripheral
I told you I'd spit a rhyme that would melt the earth
Then ask you in the afterlife if you felt the verse
On planet earth, I searched for my tranquillity first
I said I was the illest, but it didn't help me, it hurt!
And whenever I said "Can-I" the crowd said "Bus!"
Ten years later, who am I? I still got a passionate love
To be the man who I was, never give up
Irrational rush to crush every mic I clutch
When I erupt, you duck or eggs clash, flash solar blast from Bus
Then sweep you off the stage like crumbs
Grab your tongue, shout, rip it out, then shove it back in your mouth
Now, ten tell you to spit it out
I spit about them lyrics my people can't live without
Been around since '97, I've been ripping it down
Spit track after track after Beast From the East, I'm back
Before Lil' Weezy knew how to rap
When T.I. was still hustling crack, I put the muscle in rap
A 100 Bars, who fucking with that?
A thousand bars later, I ain't heard nothing from Pap
Where you was at when I was giving Big Punisher dap?
On stage with a him at the Palladium
You was in a gymnasium, I was putting chainsaws to craniums
Blazing Homosapians in the atrium, ripping jaws off aliens
Performing Channel Zero in stadiums
Up at Hot 97 disgracing them
Any radio station they place me in I broke the break-beats in
I beat her, I beat him, the beat blend, I beat them
Spit a verse to beat Barrack Obama if he win
I'm the Beast From the East, picking meat out my teeth
And as soon as the beat stop, I forget how to speak
I release a better rhyme seven times a week
To beat me you gotta be better than my last release
The bars rip ya face off, spit bars, spit shine ya skull
Till every rhyme you memorize is gone
Battle you for the respect in a battle to the death
Dial zero, call the operator ask for Bis
411 ask for RIP
555-1212, I rip the mic to shit
Before the Federal Communication Commission started a new division
With the intention to cripple our children
Mentally deficient from television
This radio programming we listen to got to many elements missing
Lyricism and wisdom got overshadowed by the singing and blinging
Deceived by a system thats media driven
A made a vow that I would get them and bit them, then injected my venom
And for that, was never forgiven my nigga
I let the rhythm hit 'em with a chemical algorithm
Liable to kill them if I ever get with them I rip them
The infinite monk, All Hail Can-I-Bus
Then wake up to this Pure Uncut
How Many Emcees do I have to bust?
I'm a Patriot with No Airplay but How Come?
My Block is your block, I Throw It Up" with Doo Wop
I'm the Enemy of the State of Hip Hop
Indibisible, Indestructible, Canibustible
The Adversarial Theater of Justice judging you
Tired of you posers, I'm the rap superstar soldier on a poster
Captain Cold Crush
Tuck the heat before I brush the teeth
The athlete at the track meet with rusty cleats
Artillery like lawn mowers with four motors and four rotors
Look like a mom with four strollers
Counterstrike like Black Kobra
With gasoline in the Super Soaker, walk over, I'll roast ya!

[DJ scratched sample]
"Cold Crush get it crackin!" (8x)[Raekwon]
Chinese marines
Jet black Beemers
That Aston blue screen
I was part of the Teamsters
Money hungry, yo meet the blingers
Avenue gun holders
Blow a nigga open, no demons
All my nigga slinging
Yeah, perpetual lifestyle, knife style
Welcome to the cleaners
Heavyweights, you gotta come see us
You right, one knee us
Welcome to the forest of the leaders
All I do is take money, come beat us
Invisible lead start flying
Lick the head, drop the ninas
Left feeling lucky like a genius
Play both sides like Serena
Found dead in the steamers
Real niggas won't talk, real as a roach
When the lights out, killa be Ghost
In the new shit, light blue Pilwig
Come through, you know we ain't do it
Rocket launcher out the window, you shoot

[Havoc]
Got killers in the Benzes
Canine senses
Everything covered from the exit to the entrance
Dedicated goons understand it's high stakes
Life out a nigga 'til his eyes dilate
It's a cold world
Surely weather with the V bombs and leathers
With the fur on the collar
We 'bout major dollars
See the hoes, they holla
When they eat us and swallow
Cause we them dime dadas
Get them top shoppers
Eyes on us, death to those that lied on us
And love for ever for all my soldiers that cried for us
I put my mind on it, relax, get high on it
Y'all niggas ain't built, I was designed for it
Lame niggas fall back in our presence
Bow down to the king, when you see me, nah mean
I ain't playing with you
Yeah, you gonna take one for the team
Fucking dog crying, ever seen a grown man scream

[Prodigy]
You tacky like head rest TVs
Your value drop, you not worth these
Bacon strips we gets, you stay broke
We stay leaning in new red Rolls
Smoke stack lightening, coming out the crack black window
That's us getting high, letting things go
We getting it, the money don't stop
Beef don't cease, the drama gonna pop
Soon as we step in the spot, shots on me
Line 'em up, kill every single bottle they got
The drama gonna pop like the pipe bomb
Hyper, the son don't chill, Allah
You get burned, try and dap me
These hands are made for clapping
A round of applause for that dumb ass rap beat, that
Fuck that, take a bath
Stay ass damp
Lift your head back up
And blow brains out[Intro]
Just let the pain out
Baby! When I'm in it she screams my name out
Tr-oy Av-e (One two One two)
B$B shit, Brooklyn, Real Life

[Verse 1: Troy Ave]
I got this burning desire to be better than most
That's probably the main reason I'm on the come up like spokes
See me in magazines, Modeling for liquor and smoke
But I keep a magazine, Confused that pretty shit and get smoked
I'm not the one to provoke
I don't make sense I just reach
Was given the world by my moms, Still I took to the streets
Where heart beats get shorten, The main focus is ballin
Had many gambles with life, And every time I was all in
My style, Was never determined by mics in the Source
Been fly since dollar fries with ketchup and hot sauce
I used to cut my wings up
Then I fucked my dreams up
No NFL,.. Still cuttingwings up
Bird ass niggas there's no relation
I cannot consider you real if you ever was hating
Unless your team playing
You might call Bron a bum but you ain't really mean it
You just mad cause he dropped 40 on Brooklyn I seen it
And felt the same way
Once I got up out my feelings still had to sling ye
Them seats ain't cheap
Win or lose still struggle, Mickey Mantle don't love you
So I fistaled out the Bronx
Fishscale for my hustle, Mufuckas

[Hook]
Just let the pain out
When I'm in it she screams my name out
Tr-oy Av-e
B$B shit, Brooklyn

[Verse 2: King Sevin]
Ayo! This my New York life
Getting money underneath the city lights
I put food on that table, Every motherfuckin night
They say you living fast you eventually die slow
It don't matter when you get it in bulk like Cosco
Ain't taking no losses I creep on the block slow
Any type of sudden movement I'm letting them shots go
At these fake real niggas I don't play them fair
Cause they been there since before I had facial hair
I ride through, And all I get is facial stares
Let a nigga try it he gone have to get his face repaired
Yeah, that's how a nigga on it
Ask me, "What it's looking like?"
I'm a tell you I can't call it
Though I ain't living right so I say my prayers every morning
Thanking God for this fly shit and nigga be important
In it for the moment, Suckafree and staying humble
When you out here in this concrete jungle
Word UP

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Troy Ave]
BSB Records, The future is here
I'm the only nigga not spitting chuck shit in your ear
You can verify all  my raps, double check and be clear
"Did you really tote all them gats and deal crack?" Hell yeah
Don't forget about my woman
They all fine and on deck
I only drink Cristal or Imperial Moet
No more weak ass Rose, That's why the game too sweet
We don't wear tight ass clothes
We don't do down south beats
That ain't New York, I restore our identification
Cause dickriding never been a form of transportation
That ain't New York, I restore our identification
Cause dickriding never been a form of transportation

[Outro][Verse 1: Raekwon]
Redskin leather, Indian sex
Pair of fresh Mocs on, lighting lear on my flesh
Let my arm roll, fresh off the honor roll, platinum bottles of Krug
All my niggas do what I got 'em for
Extra flashy grind, hit 'em with a crisp rhyme
Lines is nothing, blunt out, fuck him
All we know is jewelry and I mashed that, everybody excited
To see whatever bling on, smash that
Clever, more like a fox and ox together
Two stainless Glocks, rocks and a feather
Yeah, I'm from the lead era, shoot at
Anything that move, and move out America
And all we ever want is needed, seen it
Like a young Fillipino in Kuwait getting treated
Heavy horror armor, spike a bitch like her
Half a pound of good weed, then float through Gowanus
Brilliant master, sixteenth chapel in the Apple
Flooded up, Warridge wackos
Park Hillians getting hillions, that means millions
All on feet like Nigerian

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Shallah, I got 'em
Heatseeking missile spit, don't even try to hide, nigga
Sizzle through your skin bars, call me cyanide, bitch
Try me if you want, homey, violation's a no-no
I am the health hazard, skull & bone, poisonous logo
Unleash the dragon, massacre the scene
I'm spitting, burn a hole through the speaker, and start melting the street up
Somebody please call the fire department
And I'mma strong believer, ya'll know that I ain't the one to start with
Cuz once the fuse is lit and we strike a match and the spark smell
My face bleed and we nam them up like ox tail
Ya'll see what's happening, ya'll know what the truth is
Somebody please ask Shallah Rae why he making me do this
Cuz once I finish dudes, it's unfortunate for them yappers
Throw them in the trash, they ain't no recyling bin for rappers
I microphone control, it's the current dominant factor
The records been bodied, I personally request the pastor, gone[Intro: Raekwon]
Yo, shorty, man
Yo, I been seeing you, man, for real, man, come on, man
Yo, man, tell your girl let me sleep with her, man
I give you a thousand grams

[Raekwon]
He throw blow in lands, hit good pussy up, kush me up
My dough is advanced and rover with the lambskin coat on
Lighting reefer, my mans and them
We got plans, man, but first show me where the grams went
Ten fold scheme in the doorway, we all the way in now
What they rolling for? We blowing them bowling balls
Rifle with the knife on it, lifers jump right up on it
Maseratis double piping, wrist lightning
I rhyme for the flight men, the drug boys, thug noise
They want, they come get it from me, it's like done
I'm just a scholar with some street drug news, plug dudes
No kidnappings, we mug dudes, I love jewels
Might take your man shit, up in the jam and shit
Listening to Eric B. and Rakim planning shit
I'm all for the vandal shit, good nights
Bet I got a good gun with long bullets and a Taruga light
Come to the palace, chalices, hood pussy from Dallas
All of this is childish, I allowed this
Rap saved the babies, all these young niggas with these 3-80's
Fronting like they robbed down Macy's
Stop it, we them cockpit boys, we got shit
Plus pop shit, grab your bird twatty; obnoxious
Flashin' knots and shit, yachts that smell like piss
It's all good, we only fucking in her mouth, partner
The lock men, I rock, was robbing, met her out in Africa
Yeah, yeah, bought her my Glock, let me hold that man...

[Hook 2X: Raekwon]
We the Dutch Masters, the blunts with the gun flashers
Love maxing, watch niggas last moves
Keep it cool, get those ones, play the building
Get your run game on, and stay stashing

[N.O.R.E.]
Aiyo, octopus hands, slash backs of the gold rolly
Shootouts in the liquor store, my man on parole owe me
Old man freedom still preaching on the block
Still talking, you can't sling drums and hold a walkman
Fishcale dumped inside the quarter water juices
Staircase madness, the hammer stash gooses
Went to time flow, yo I heard they let Shyne go
Big whip spaces, betting at the horse races
Old school wit it, banging Julio Iglesias
Suaded leather seats, feet reclined, line back of moves
Homey with the chipped tooth from Faragent, he arrogant
Did a bid with him, gave him razors in the church hall
Then he turn Muslim, Jihad to hurt ya'll
Hooligan goon shit, never onto FUBU
Never on computers, niggas never heard of Google
Mink slippers lounging with the cashmere headband
Still spending Euro's, Germany, Dresden
Dubai high, drinking all the French water
Champagne-yah, my campaign a, macarena
Aim a flamer, his accent was Dana Daner
I mean Dana Dane, distribution crazy 'caine
Elvis sideburns, his appearance always crazy lame
Move big weight though, winnebago
Remind me of Dego, and Jose Canseco
The man in San Diego, that's where he lay low
His soldiers do what he say so, all day though
Yeah, little nigga you gotta respect protocol
That's where you come from homeyboy

[Hook 2X: N.O.R.E.]
Aiyo, cigar niggas, Phillies my favorite
Beat the affidavit, that good weed, you save it
Run through the alleyways, ever since the valley days
We been on that New York shit but smoking Cali haze

[Capone]
Aiyo, five grams crushed in a bill fold, he snorted it
Coke professor, test it before he ordered it
Lamping on a La-Z-Boy, real McCoy, flick the ashes
Champagne bitches is butt naked, filling glasses
Whips with the mean stashes, ox spitting gun clappers
Onasis money, she fly with the package
Easy Wider rider nigga, I'm a bamboo vandal
Ran through cities, looking for white paper, that rice papers
That bullshit, the back of the Bibles, the light saver
I blow joints to the head, Al Queda raider
Black bandanna, old hammer, phone scrambler
Niggas wearing wires cuz shit bad, lit on fire
Old school marvels, pardon the middle, waves bust to the side
Still rocking diddy bop like '85
Them pinky rings, diamond crust Diors is diamonds dusted, trust it
My niggas rob to rob niggas, so fuck it
Hip hop awards, I was low in them bucket, blowing kisses at Toya Luckett
Before that I was backstage puffing

[Hook 2X: Capone]
For my bamboo niggas, lay low playing the benches, relentless
Fresh home from a sentence
You know the rules, get your money and move, blast tools
Clap dudes, keep they ear to the streets with tattoos[Scarface]
I'm just another ghetto boy
Single parent upbringing, mama's pride and joy
Dad died 'fore I got a chance to meet that dude
So I was raised in the hood, in the streets I grew
Seen it all, it ain't too much I ain't done yet
Let my nuts hang, nigga I ain't scared of shit
Seen death in my eyes, musta not have been time
Cause I'm the last of this motherfuckin breed of mine
Yeah and can't nobody tell you no different
The nerve of this motherfucker sayin I'm tripping
The nerve of you motherfuckers questionin this
When I'm as real as a realass nigga can get
And I was raised with that G-code embedded in my blood
And I would rather die than tell on a nigga from my hood
Or tell it on a motherfucker period
I take the code to the game that serious
The streets got rules, it's certain shit you don't do like
Sayin it was me when you knowin that it was you
It's not defamation if what I'm sayin is true
Picked a fight, got beat, now this pussy is tryin to sue
Bitch, you knowin what the outcome was
Fuck with one fuck with all, we were bound by blood
Not the blood of the gang but the blood of James
It's out of love for this nigga we pump slugs in frames
That's the type of dude you're listenin to
Soft to you for a minute then I'm trippin with you
And since you want it with me I'll position them goons
They carry out the order to this mission and boom
Ya out, now what was all this chit-chat about?
A word from the wise, keep my dick out ya mouth
Apparently I been too lenient on dudes
Cause you niggas done forgot who the streets belong to
I'm the motherfuckin king, I'm the motherfuckin mayor
I'm the president, the don, the boss of all players
Remember me, the one you got your idea from?
Well I'm still here, planted on this block I slung
So fresh and so clean, complicated rhyme schemes
You niggas is monotone, ain't no fuckin with heat
I'm a motherfuckin g and if I'm lyin then poof
May the Lord strike me dead in this motherfuckin booth
I'm the truth, emeritus, the F-A-C
The M to the O to the motherfuckin B
OG, to the critics analyzing my shit
Thinkin so-and-so is better, you can suck my dick
Cause it's been 20 years and counting and I still ain't bouncing
Fuck the club I'm a true thug, the realest nigga out here
Yeah I listen to them bullshit caps
Or how they so-called shine but that bullshit's wack
Steady on my grind and when I pull this strap
I'mma show you what I mean by "These fools just rap"
Cause I'm just as greedy as the next man is
I see em sellin and then I'mma feed my kids
And it is what it is, you can take it how you want it
Motherfuck who I offend they can meet me on the corner
It don't matter who you is or where you come from punk
When you see me that's the motherfuckin bell, bitch, jump
Cause I'm tired of you niggas disrespecting the great
I am legend, it ain't nobody fuckin with Face
My catalog's timeless
I could go on for days and days
Let me count the ways I got paid
It's over when I leave this stage
I'mma turn the page, say goodbye to Face
Wave[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Dressed in FILA, change in the beehive
7:30 nigga slick coupe with him, see ma?
I'm rich, my bitch, before and after, kept her well
Sit right there, enjoy the chapter
Bounce, 2 ounces get burnt
Thinkin' bread now, buy more lead, get the dread town
Let's smoke on the furlough king
Switch to Merlot, I know them niggas is bird, they swerve dope
Nobody gettin' it, whores is wicked with it
Little kids growin' up fast, teens is wickeded
No jobs, no checks, it's like rockin' an Olex
Rolex, her father is Cotex
Mother is so vexed, brothers is on X
Niggas is slummin' it, I'd rather see no necks
Dumb niggas, this the decade of bum niggas
It won't work, no matter how much bread you jerk

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
Inhale it (x3)
Weed so loud, all my neighbors say they hear it
Roll up the strong, inhale it (x3)
Weed so loud, all my neighbors say they hear it

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
I'm usually in the lawsuits frontin'
Comin' out Bank of America, big knot on me, I'm comfy
Roll the joints, jumpin' in joints, niggas with coins beat the point
And we want appointments, yo nigga, get some ointment
Stop playin', start prayin', I just might start sprayin'
Niggas is ass and all day with it
No style with no pals, niggas is so foul
It shows how I only fuck with real, them niggas know now
I slow down, don't wanna catch a charge and go down
I'm too large, drop a bag, use a marksman
Pause, said, "You don't want no parts of me, kid"
I'm just shootin' you real rap, so go wash with it
A legend with his hands up, suits is glammed up
I'm just bowlin' for millions out in Japan, what
Plannin' somethin', niggas ride around wearin' somethin'
Other than that or rap, I'd rather fade black

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
These niggas is dead already, I use machetes to eat spaghetti
They really couldn't ride a mile on my Pirellis
Bags so heavy the damns collapsed
Conversate about me, that's a chain reaction
Pressure to press in past aggression
Hope your body guard got pain protection
One in the chamber, middle finger, no fornicate
So many bullets in the clip, it's 'bout to sufficate
My uncle was late, my aunt ain't show up
How you gon' tell an old man to grow up
It's like comparin' Earl to throw up
Same frame of mind but a different poster
I'm 'posed to be what I wanna be
Dream so big for the world to see
First class, fruits and tea
And usually the only black man is me

[Hook]This the story of Osama
Allahu akbar in Uganda
Niggas put me on to the drama
Now sit back a song with the data
A boy from Saudi Arabia who had it made
But he hated the fortune glamour the fame the game
An Oxford graduated, rather see the sun when it rain
He studied economics, Islamic, drink tonic, hate chronic
Didn't hate america he hated the congress
Old daddy die when he was ten and he's powerful man
Who had paper slinging oil and men
Wealthy religious and educated ayo this made lots of bread
Family been [?]
Three wifes at seventeen
Now it gets better as team
Yeah it's time to form the mujahideen
Warhead religion for the muslims by any means
Reminds me of Farrakhan Malcolm and King
Play boss who had driving for show
His clans was well written
So the kid slid to Sudan
Had a couple vans some land
Few good religious brothers did all his prayers with him
Giving him grants
It was Afghanistan he had training can't smash
Jumping out of [?] Toyotas with [?]
Fly turbans suburbans sands [?]
Jumping off the camels eating turkey and lamp
Blood brothers holy warriors the others wore cover
Fuck by injury let's explore bring the luggage
They shot the terror board with no order
300 degrees out one glass a water for four of us
Drink brother these are them crusaders
Who slide through the Mid East [?] back to the border
There's some [?] now it's war
A global terror in your area US calling it dogs
Bush with his regime against mujahideen suicide bombers versus the marines
Al Qaeda was skin nerve gas anthrax thrown on the scene
Taliban coming martyrly[Sample: from "Dagon" by H. P. Lovecraft]
"I am writing under appreciable strain
Since by tonight I should be no more"

*Casting spell*

[Canibus]
Yo, my hands are dirty cause I shook yours
Yea, you tried to curse me cause I took yours
But where?, somewhere, nowhere near
I walk where no man dares
So the world could share one man's fair
My cares are your cares
Your tears are my tears
When you talk to God, I eavesdrop on your prayers
I eavesdrop on your prayers
The industry could not stop my career
Fuck your record sales, where's your skills at?
You gotta million fans, but you're still wack
I can't feel that, what they've been exposed to is not real rap
Real rap is like chemical crack
I'm drippin' by my addiction is stealin' and bring it back
I prove it on every single track; I prove it on every single track
This is real Hip-Hop before it became rap
Do these magazines mention that? NO!
Does radio pay attention to that? NO!
Do they thank us for representin' that? No!
You think I let 'em get away with that? NO!
They just use us, abuse us
Stupid fuckin' reality shows do not amuse us
But they don't give two fucks; I said they don't give two fucks
Now it's all up to you, bus...

*Church bell sounds*[Hook]
Guess who's back in the moterfucking house
With a fat dick for your motherfucking mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too

[Verse 1]
Guess who's back and I'm working on the clock - say bro
It's crooked I, got 'em jerking on the block - they know
The coupe Prego, convertible the top - aiyoo
Your goons lay low, I murder with a Glock - fatal
I'd rather fuck with some bitches
But these haters love drama, guess it comes with the riches
And all my thugs with the business
In the club wit'cha misses
Love the hugs and the kisses
My rap money in my right hand (get 'em)
My trap money in my left hand (get 'em)
You can get married to crime, I'll be the best man
I'm in and out of the game
Proud of the power that came
You cowards out of your brain
Uhh, Scram Jones is bringing the speaker crack out
Stop the beat, Long Beach! Bring it back now

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yeah, hoes recognize, niggas do too - really
A few - milli; the boy hustle too silly
And new giddy, some real dudes move with me
Goon city, Bad Boy, new Diddy
Rrah! Rrrah! What the bloodclaat?
I wanna see that ass popping when the drums drop
Rrrah! Rrah! Keep your guns cocked
My Cali niggas smoking kush 'till they lungs stop
Illegal money in my right hand (get 'em)
But legal money in my left hand (get 'em)
Look at the ice on my hype man
That's C.O.B., we at the check stand
And tell the fans eat a dick
My grind is sick with it
I'm just trying to be legit
I'm a rider, I'm the kind you need to get
I'm the guy to lead the ship
I'm just trying to be the shit

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Guess who's back in the motherfucking house illin'
A wild villain, fresh to death, my style killin'
Drought fillin', new Ferrari without ceilin'
Your souse willin', my dick's in her mouth chillin'
You're now fucking with the braveheart
When you hear pow pow, that's my trademark
I gotta get it for my homies in the graveyard
I hear 'em yelling ''Crook, you better hit the game hard''
Label money in my right hand (get 'em)
Under-the-table money in my left hand (get 'em)
Build a small fortune with my grind man
But Rubin and Simmons was smarter cause they built Def Jam
Inspire me to take bigger steps
Fans rather see me shoot guns on the internet
Rappers beefing in public, where's the intellect?
Talking 'bout killing each other, why you ain't did it yet?

[Hook][Verse 1: Styles P]
The small talk is irrelevant, gonna kill an elephant
Niggas look fly and their bitches look elegant
Let the birds fly like a pelican from NY up to Maryland
Be more careful, them little niggas will ear you
Tattoo tears over here, if you dare to, yeah
Wax out the trippy, wax off the other shit
Max with the hippies, mac out the window
If niggas will act iffy, M's off the piffy
Shit is getting sticky like Jiffy
Hood gon' cry, if they hit me
I'm a real ass nigga, get with me
Cushion to grind and my look is designed
And my dope is raw like it got cooked in China
Always on some other shit, even the hating niggas is loving it

[Hook 2x]
Even the hating niggas is loving it (Even the haters love it!)
Even the hating niggas is loving it (Bullshit too!)
Even the hating niggas is loving it (Word!)
Fuck all the ho ass niggas and fuck the government

[Verse 2: Sheek Louch]
Haters still loving it, but I don't give a fuck if they didn't
I'm black loving it, poppin' off of some other shit
Hand on the tommy, couple of shooters behind me
They trying to take the black man out like Mitt Romney
Me and P, add Kiss too and it's 3D (L-O-X!)
IMAX movie, shine on our watchers is dookey
They love my style, alligator band on a hublot
True Religions on, Louis kicks, all on a big toe (You see me?)
You don't think I've seen a million dollars? I did though
Christopher Wallace money, every night is a big show
Hit the gym, back looking fucking for Indo
Dundun, bitch been on my dick from the get-go

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 3: Styles P]
It's crack or gat for the dollars
Ride around town in a black Impala
Niggas can act wild or show a bitch a mile script
Same ass guns to send an actor to valor
Sort of like the car that gave me no hope
I'm real rugged yet smoother than the bean old soap
I mean body wash, upon the shore is where his body was
It wasn't me, I was smoking weed with his bodyguard
I'm not feeling you, probably made a plan on killing
You ain't rap, nigga I'm willing to, I'm a mile boss
All day, part of it for departing, I'm like John fold tape
Where P goes is liquid, connect seeds solid though
Any sign of the feds, motherfucking bombing those
Whole court on the streets before I do 24 years
Being broke is the only thing money fears

[Hook 2x]A time for us, some day there'll be a new world
A world of shining hope for you and me

Chorus

*scratching* I'm back!
*scratching* Did you forget about me?
(x4)

Verse 1

What's happenin', I'm back off the wagon, smashin' this rappin' ting
Rappers think they're dapper, it's sad, the badness they're babblin'
Chattin' 'bout packin' Gatlings and battlin', I'll batter 'em
My adjectives are like daggers and javelins that stab ya' skin
Not challenging, maggots are blagging, fraggles are hagglin'
Back with a classic to snatch ya' status off these Plasticine
I've dabbled in, madness, how I've handled it is bafflin'
I'm trapped in sin and damaged within, but still I have to win
Aimin' to break the pavements and take it straight to the majors
Make all of my favourites famous, I pray that today it changes
I patiently pave the way for a day that we make the papers
The haters are stayin' haters, they're fakers, they're blatant traitors
Don't say it's chasin' my status, I'll break away from the matrix
They laid us to waste of phases and slave them for slamin' caners
And blaze us, complacent Pagans who strained to escape the Masons
Who gave us the AIDS and plagues and not blaming my brain's patrons

Chorus

*scratching* I'm back!
*scratching* Did you forget about me?
(x4)

Verse 2

Put on my Air Max, and walk around a day in my shoes
Look at the bare facts, and talk about payin' my dues
You realise every bar that I'm sayin' is true
Phone in to cuss, any DJ that ain't playin' my tunes
In a drought, consider me the Guinness Stout
No I'm not the biggest or baddest, I'm just the illest out
His bars might sound good when he spits 'em out
But would it mean something if you were lookin' at it, written down?
I can't front, like the way I'm livin' is perfect
Can't look at the cards you got, saying you didn't deserve it
Sellin' poison to people, that isn't my purpose
Knowledge of self, that's the flippin' gift that I'm cursed with
People's Army, all my guys organise properly
Feds wanna commit, borderline sodomy
Bring coppers in choppers, you all can try stoppin' me
Every tune's a chapter in my autobiography

Chorus

*scratching* I'm back!
*scratching* Did you forget about me?
(x4)
