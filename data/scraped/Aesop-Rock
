[Verse 1]
Flash that buttery gold, jittery zeitgeist
Wither by the watering hole, Border patrol
What are we to Heart Huckabee
Art fuckery suddenly
Not enough young in his lung for the water wings
Colorfully vulgar poacher, out of mulch
Like I'm a pull the pulse out a soldier and bolt
Fine, sign of the time we elapse
When a primate climb up a spine and attach
Eye for an eye, by the bog life swamps and vines
They get a rise out of frogs and flies
So when a dogfight's hog-tied prize sort of costs a life
The mouths water on a fork and knife
And the allure isn't right
No score on a war-torn beach
Where the cash cow's actually beef
Blood turns wine when it leak for police
Like that's not a riot it's a feast, let's eat

[Hook]
And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by the funhouse cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky like none shall pass
None shall pass
None shall pass

[Verse 2]
Now if you never had a day a snow cone couldn't fix
You wouldn't relate to the rogue vocoder blitz
How he spoke through a NoDoz motor on the fritz
Cause he wouldn't play rollover fetch like a bitch
And express no regrets, though he isn't worth a homeowner's piss
To the jokers who pose by the glitz
Fine sign of the swine in the swarm
When a king is a whore who comply and conform
Miles outside of the eye of the storm
With a siphon to lure out a prize and award
While avoiding the vile and bizarre that is violence and war
True blue triumph is more
Like wait, let him snake up out of the centerfold
Let it break the walls of Jericho, ready go
Sat where the old, cardboard city folk
Swap tales with heads like every other penny throw

[Hook]
And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by The Funhouse cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky like none shall pass
None shall pass
None shall pass

[Interlude]
You tried, you tried, you tried to trick me
You've got a, you've, you've got a, a lot of nerve
I'm, I'm not, I'm not, trying to trick you
I'm try, I'm try, I'm trying to help

[Verse 3]
Okay woke to a grocery list, goes like this
Duty and death anyone object, come stand in the way
You could be my little Snake River Canyon today
And I ran with a chain of commands
And a jetpack strapped where the backstab lands if it can
Fine sign of the vibe in the crowd
When I cut a belly open to find what climb out
That's quite a bit of gusto he muster up
To make a dark horse rush like enough's enough
It must've struck a nerve so they huff and puff
Till all the king's men fluster and clusterfuck
And it's a beautiful thing
To my people who keep an impressive wingspan
Even when the cubicle shrink
You got to pull up the intruder by the root of the weed
And march him through the machine

[Hook][Sample] (x4)
Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
And keep on, 'till the break of dawn

[Verse 1]
Put one up for Shackle Me Not, clean logic procreation
I did not invent the wheel, I was the crooked spoke adjacent
While the triple sixers' lassos keep angels roped in the basement
I walk the block with a halo on a stick, poking your patience
Y'all catch a thirty second flash visual
Dirty cooperative med platoon, bloom, head-trip split ridiculous
Fathom the splicing of first generation fuck up
With trickle down anti-hero smack (Kraken!)
I pace my game for zero hour completion cretin, splash
Duke of early retirement picket dream
American Nightmare hogging the screen
I'll hold the door open so you can stumble in
If you'd stop following me around the jungle gym
Now it's honor and I spell it with the 'H' I stole from heritage
Merit crutched on the wretched refuse from my teeming resonance
I promise temperance towards breed with a leaning conscious
See, the creed accents responsive but my spores divorced the wattage
And I'm sleeping now (Wow!) Yeah, the settlers laugh
You won't be laughing when your covered wagons crash
You won't be laughing when the buzzards drag your brother's flags to rags
You won't be laughing when your front lawn is spangled with epitaphs
(You won't be laughing!) Then I'll hang my boots to rest when I'm impressed
So I triple knot them then I forgot them
His origami dream is beautiful, but man, those wings will never leave the ground
Without a feather and a lottery ticket, now settle down

[Hook] (x4)
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day
Put the pieces back together my way

[Verse 2]
Slacker-bound imitated tabloid headline with a pulse
Shimmy cross the centerfold, enter dead time engulfed
Divvy crumbs for the better souls with seven deadly stains
Adhere the blame to crystal conscience
The result's a lowlife counting on one hand what he's accomplished
Okay, link me to activism chain activate street sweep
Plug deteriorating cenobite pendragon
I hock spores coursed by the morbid spreading of mad men, Alley gospel
Sinking your Lincoln-Log cabin and Charlie Chaplin waddle
I could zig zag and zig em again for the badge dreams
Sparkle in my brick wall windows another thick installment
Of one night in Gotham without the wretched
Houston we have a problem
Attached to the festive batch of city goblins
Who split holiday freaks on a box cut cinema high road bellow
Head gripped, watch red bricks turn yellow
Sort of similar to most backbones at camp Icarus
Where all fiddler crabs congregate and get pampered for bickering
Life's not a bitch, life is a beautiful woman
You only call her a bitch because she won't let you get that pussy
Maybe she didn't feel y'all shared any similar interests
Or maybe you're just an asshole who couldn't sweet talk the princess
Kiss the speaker wire Peter - Pacifism pagan thresh hold
Stomach full of halo kibbles, wings span cast black upon vigils
Hear the Duck Hunt ticker tape vision and pick apart the pixels
I got a friend of polar nature and it's all peace
You and I seek similar stars but can't sit at the same feast
Metal Captain
This cat is asking if I've seen his bit of lost passion
I told him: "Yeah," but only when I pedaled past him

[Hook]They did not know how long they had been there (x7)

[Verse 1]
Look
Unsigned hype
Front line aeronauts flurry
Zero dark thirty
Zero Friends minotaur-fugly stepchild
Evoke lunch jumped over plunging necklines
Up, beside tongue-tied hungry enzymes
Devolved into mothmen munching textiles
Punisher
Out past go-time
Back 10 fried worms chubbier
Brown grass both sides
Canned food
Manmade tools
Lanacane, band aids, mandrake root
Bindle on a broomstick, pancaked shoes
And a handshake-proof campaign, can’t lose
Can’t gain
Smoke out moles like a force of nature
Pray fortune return to his favor
Swiftly
Maybe in the form of a nest egg
Maybe in the form of a tesla death ray
Or a solid gold scene with something better to celebrate
Than powder on a face like a flatfoot on jelly day
M-m-moral compass all batshit
Spinning in the shadows of immoral magnets
Are we supporting the artist or enabling the addict
I mean, I guess it matters to me
I wish it mattered to you
How a thousand virtues
Kick the same bucket like chinatown turtles

[Hook]
Roving packs of elusive young become
Choke-lore writers over boosted drums
In the terrifying face of a future tongue
Down down from a huntable surplus to one x5

[Verse 2]
(Check his own) Breakneck pulse
Over colors in a drain
That emote sugar skulls in the rain
Flower-eyes melting
Guided by a levee made of bath tiles, tilting
Quarter up and headed for the kill screen
No corner cut, no build team
Only a particularly menacing
Angle perpendicular to everything
Boys room cherry bomb
Boy/goon very much runnin' with the devil in the mellotron
Hello
Here’s where a tale of caution
Pounds coffin nails
To bootlegs of Hawkwind, saw tooth
Nevermind straw to gold
Spin hearts on sleeves into heads on poles
Arm in the maw
Fish out pith like a business card from a jar at the mall
A-alike androids dreaming of carbon applause
Get stuffed with cartoon cigars
Cold pack, neti-pot, home to roost
Around folk backed into what they most lampoon
Shook to the fevered brow and broke ankles
Daisy, declawed pound, no thank you
Fade me
Failed all basic training
But I spent a couple groundhog days with a changeling
Silhouette, the god’s last cigarette
Anything less would be ri-god-damn-diculous

[Hook][Chorus: Aesop Rock]
We don't need no walkie-talkies, nope no walkie talkies
We don't need your coughing when offing the morning coffee
No, we don't need no walkie-talkies, nope no walkie-talkies
We just want our hermitry to stay and our coffee to go

[Verse 1: Aesop Rock]
And the last shall be
First to immerse in the pass out heat
Face in the mud where the moxie melt
'Till he woke up drowning in tchotchke hell
More in a cave with a torch on the wall
Than a window arrangement of porcelain dolls
On a brand new day, saw what he saw
Property owners who crawl to the mall
With a bad toupee and a face like he author the law
Pace like he mourning a loss
Right hand on a can of worms
Left full of gold he will trade for turf, I mean
That's ok, you got to answer to you at the end of the volatile day
But a model of mercy and might, no way
Marionette who will clap and obey
Dude, look, all that noise
Call that flight of the water boys
Meet and greet and they all slap five
Cheek to cheek when they colonize
And a grown-ass man shall abide as he wish
Walk that path with a dime and a stick
Walk that path with a diamond and wine
Walk that path to the firing line
Just walk, pay no mind
To the new recruit with the play-doh spine
Let's be friends from opposite ends
Wave to the kid don't hop on the fence
Play to the radius far and away
Orbit wide don't park in his space
One little martyr who talk in his face
Make one little Weathermen sharpen the blades

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Aesop Rock]
And the last shall be
First to the curb with the mad cow meat
Face in the bars of a regular cell
When he woke up high in collectible hell
Boom town kid who was taught by the binge
That a man who expire with the most shit win
That's warpy american nonsense penned by the rich
Not a routine friend in a pinch
Still not used to the stench
How it throws off otherwise lucid events
In the case the afraid observe
I got a Pro-Keds box full of layman's terms, it goes
Hey, peace, pray for the plagued
Major relief and capacious rains
But just cuz I don't want to war with you
It don't mean go warm up the barbecue
I'm like pardon you, sawed off limit
My high noon is a quick little minute
I don't wanna spend it sitting with a critic
Who simply isn't going to ever really get it
This HQ is alive and alone
No driveway no sign of a home
No dial tone, no line for the phone
No world's tiniest violin song
And I might just lie to them all, lie in the morgue
With a deep breath hiding and bored
Fighting a smile, highly annoyed
When the timing is right I will rise and record
Call for the monster beats and Blockhead got
Animal drums like he's doctor teeth
It goes red light green light 1 2 3
One large coffee, fuck you, peace

[Bridge: Aesop Rock]

[Outro: John Darnielle]
I crawled down to the basement
When the weather got cold
Like a lost lamb returning to the fold
And when the outside world recedes from view
It's just a year's supply of make-up
And memories of you
1967 Colt 45, holding back the vampires
Keeping me alive
There's an envelope with some cash in it
Out by the front door
This is what they make you take the medication for[Hook: Aesop Rock]
Money (x29)
Motherfucker

[Verse 1]
Money on my motherfucking mind
Cop five haircuts at the same time
White gold pants, Jet Ski made of wine
Foie gras bust of Albert Einstein
Get Money

[Rob Sonic]
Money out my motherfucking mouth
A mansion, a ranch, and a camp and a town
A motherfucking store with a floor made of scalps
Bobby from the block don't got rocks, he got Alps
Get Money

[Aesop Rock]
Money in the motherfucking jar
Shark fin pastry
Summers on Mars
Twenty motherfuckers in a levitating car
Seven-forty-seven full of women and cigars
Get money

[Rob Sonic]
Money in the motherfucking pot
A castle full of cars and the yard full of yachts
A leopard with a mink
And an arm full of clocks
All hand wound everyday by a Spock
Get money

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
[Aesop Rock]
Money is a motherfucking joke
Forty bald eagles sewn onto a coat
Zoo with the crib, mermaid in the moat
Buy another strip mall every eighth note
Get money

[Rob Sonic]
Money ain't a motherfucking prob
It's a sport I invented to win when I watch
And own all the rights and the lights and the locks
Even own all the ice in the Sprite you just dropped
Get money

[Aesop Rock]
Money or your motherfucking life
Two ton angel carved outta ice
Alligator sailboat, dollar sign eyes
Fill a warehouse full of Van Goghs twice
Get money

[Rob Sonic]
Money or your motherfucking heart
I could give it to my dog
He makes money when he barks
Or put it in my fridge
Or in one of my parks that i bought
So my robots could learn how to LARP
Get money

[Hook][Verse 1]
Uh, greasy grimy gopher guts
Poolside, O for 1 and don't forget spoons twice
Lukewarm folgers; mold on his moonpie
Rooms in his home that dissipate into fruit flies
Suicide lane wide load ride looting in the wake of an amicable marooning
My duty go from moving in packs to sharing food with a cat
To Mom "It's me, I accidentally sawed a woman in half"
She said "I'll keep you in my prayers," I said "I need to hide a body"
She said "Ok, honey, talk to you on Friday"
Apparently we share a common plasma so the growing disconnection doesn't matter, according to the blood-and-water chapter
Weird, who wrote the blood-and-water chapter anyway?
Probably some surly dad, only child, 30 cats
Looking for a way to reconnect with an averted past
Except it doesn't always work like that

[Hook 1]
Today I pulled three baby snakes out of moss and dirt
Where the wild strawberry vines toss and turn
I told them, "You will grow to be something inventive and electric;
You are healthy, you are special, you are present"
Then I let them go
Oh...

[Verse 2]
You were sitting at the gate awaiting spirits and provisions
I was privy to a headache over pirouetting innards
In the mirror sweating pitchers; who's there: simian or lizard?
As it were there is a disappearing difference
In ambition and material;
Antiquated gentleman outlaws reduced to a ferris wheel of vitriol
Move as a godless heathen; black gums, tooth gone, bootleg 'Yukon Cornelius'
I'm a... That's better, here we here we go
Disenchanted face printed on a zero-dollar bill
Got a little plot of land where authority isn't recognized
Contraband keeping the core of his Hyde Jekyll-ized
Check! Never mind a misanthrope vying for affection to the wretched sound of mysticism dying
It is something he must handle on his own; the wind blown way, wanna win? Don't play

[Hook 2]
Today I pulled three green frogs out of leaf and bark
Where the grape vines climb a convenient barn
I told them, "You will grow to be something tenacious and exalted;
You are mighty, you are gracious, you are lauded"
Then I let them go
Oh..

[Verse 3]
I have been completely unable to maintain
Any semblance of relationship on any level
I have been a bastard to the people who have
Actively attempted to deliver me from peril
I have been acutely undeserving of the ear that listen up
And lip that kissed me on the temple
I have been accustomed to a stubborn disposition
That admits it wish it's history disassembled
I have been a hypocrite in sermonizing tolerance
While skimming for a ministry to pretzel
I have been unfairly resentful of those I wish
That acted different when the bidding was essential
I have been a terrible communicator
Prone to isolation over sympathy for devils
I have been my own worse enemy since the very genesis of rebels

[Hook 3]
Today I pulled three ghost crabs out of rock and sand
Where the low tide showcased a promised land
I told them, "You will grow to be something dynamic and impressive;
You are patient, you are gallant, you are festive"
Then I let them go
Oh

(On and on and on and on...)[Verse 1]
At night I wear a wolf's head on my regular head
Consider an irregular character sketch
Food hoarder, communes with the flora
Computes in cahoots with beauty and brute force
I've got a brand new normal at a thirty in New York, plus
Years at the fire pulling portions out of corn husks
Never mind time on the short bus
Terrifying errant knights thwarting any motherfucking fork tongued-sport
Agita flashing the hind molars, though his body less a weapon more a bag of lipomas
Over medium, treat skin-tags like scratch-offs
Rap like black-ops, rappers like lap dogs
He got the rad moves, catty alpha rat-proof (wait)
Twenty-sided die at the crap-shoot (wait)
Looking for a black hole to casually collapse through
Try aisle nine by the cat food
There it is
Ooh wee, do we roast in a bilge, when the skinny from afar is "Thar be gold in them hills"
Time better let a couple truths decay, or somebody going to rue the day
Check, check, check

[Hook 1]
Catch 'em on the lam
(I ain't joking)
No maps, no muster point
(Nah, I ain't joking)
I put a pebble on a tomb
(I ain't joking)
Making bath tub meth
I'm joking
Here we go

[Verse 2]
The whip got a tongue and teeth
Too tough, two blood-shot eyes with a Tungston bleep
When any putrefying arrow wants your lungs in reach
I field a vessel going zero to the fuck y'all think
And when your function fails I'm on an undisclosed island
Stroking exotic animals, open up rocket science
Leaning a jewellers loupe over a stolen sock 'o diamonds
Palm-made products a portrait of modern triumph, try us
Back at the battering ram post-haste
Cro-mags, wait till this Saturday plans grow legs
All you hear is intermittent code names
Ricochet around the geometry of a closed space
Unfrozen part of his new J.O
Face of divine evil, heart of Camu Tao
Some people find the daylight to be oddly alluring
I was in the dark, dodging and burning

[Hook 2]
Maybe cause I look like an ugly doll
(I ain't joking)
Pack a wallop in the wheelhouse
(Nah, I ain't joking)
Leave brass tacks everywhere
(I ain't joking)
I own many many homes
I'm joking
Here we go

[Verse 3]
All hock-tooie no costume
Black hoodie you can set your watch to
Tall drink, depths like an air raid
Radically detach with purveyors of the hair-brain
Down with the ship go a dozen fried wild links
Upperway, upper-case tri-state style kings
Get pie-faced, sent home tied to the sinewaves
Lights off, spine on sideways
Riding down the block, scooping Bobby in a boogie-down
Tome told me tell 'em "Hello, 7:30 noodle-town"
Cool 'em down, global domination over salt bake
Situation comedy in broke dude cosplay
You don't want a meeting on an off-day trading horror stories from the hollows
The summary is as follows:
"These hate those and this thinks, that's absurd"
Yip yap, y'all cats and birds

[Hook 3]
Meow meow meow meow meow
(I ain't joking)
Talking rubes on the radio
(Nah, I ain't joking)
Uh, suckers never play me
(I ain't joking)
I found Jimmy Hoffa's body
I'm joking
Here we go[Verse One]
I saw the wrought-iron cross inverted circlin' above my turret
Slid the spiraling banister down and hide, banished am I
My ruby glass glazed specs staple the trader of market thieves
Where vendors count the stolen citrus out their pyramids
Mirrored without a slapstick
Mavericks plugged directly to third rail surges
Piss on electric mayhem through city commuter circuits
Oooh child, raised as oddity, son of a circus side-show freak
Pertinent to the slide show, the wino's leak but I won't speak
Infected projection hung thick in the air
Pungent as burning plastics upon whiffing the nasal cringes
Pucker another 60-second lapse while 60 stars collapse the suckers
And I'm reborn every time the wine metamorphs back to water, my god
Sweet Christ, crucify me with railroad spikes
Use my skull to bash them all in, gather sit and grin, weave
All fail the most serene communication pageant
Where sitting with a stranger and living awards the badges
I spell merit with my name stitched on my heritage
And serenade arrogant simpletons to feed my cherished grin
Buried in leagues a "'Please', Thank You', 'Pardon', 'Excuse Me'
'Your Welcome', 'May I?' ohh, I'd like to nod but no you may not
Let's take a deep breath, naw let's take a breath
Naw let's take, naw let's aaah shit, well I guess that about says it
Maybe I'll craft the sycamore canoe and paddle upstream
Where the luck seems to reflect precious lovely interventions

[Hook]
I have died a thousand deaths, and I apologize for you and yours
For kicking your fantasies overboard
I mean I'm only one servant, making one hell of a diversion
And if the masses have agreed to split the sea then let it bleed

I have died a thousand deaths, and I apologize for them and theirs
For breaking down their ropes, ladders and stairs
I mean I´m only one servant, making one hell of a diversion
And if the masses have agreed to split the sea then let it bleed

[Verse Two]
You ever died a thousand deaths?, I have
And in the morrow stood a thousand steps from where my nourish laughed
And made a boat at, nomad, I roam in a social coma
Jonesing for home alone days to sit and count my poems, I
Dig in the dirt I rig up the earth like pulley systems
Thereby painting the perfect metaphor for hung juries
Strung along a song of spawning thorns of fury
Numb the anti-add-alarm before he recognized this worries me
Carpet-bombers spearheading fink operetta
Walk my line, now what? Now strut that little poison combine
Y'all call natural, in honesty promise me twenty thousand Sloppy leagues
And dive and finding my thriving ivy leaves climbing up the pit fall
Lack of most lords aboard, heroes unsung heroes unbrung rewards
Yo if I flutter in a trouble clutch then I dance fancy forward
Like park children double dutching ropes in burning city summers
My wing span can and will employ full expansion
Unfolding while lamping at home with my hands panning for gold
Told them the roof was on fire, when that structure burned to ashes
All y'all saw was Aesop Rock holding an empty book of matches
Maybe I'll sit until the spilling motors clear
Maybe I'll sit and stroke my billie goat beard
And rethink the time angels appear, maybe I won't
Bundled in my humble little plummet
Numb enough to die those thousand deaths under the sun it makes me sick

[Hook x2]Fasten your seatbelts, remove glasses

Bright lights, bright lights

I wear shoes to bed
Paint teeth on my lips
Trench foot, gangrened for the win
Blitzkrieg Bopper
Petitioned out of shit's creek proper
The only inaccessible blip on the streaming doppler
Screaming ‘uncle’ in a sea of TV doctors
Free to occupy the same space in differing degrees of seedy commerce
The shot is slow pan, monitor guffawing
Flooded p.d. blotter under horizontal coffee
More to follow, outside tweakers are in love
Teeny Raque Welch submarining through the blood, voyagers
Poisoned or maybe just a misfit toy or two
Depending on the beacon that your voyeurs choose
That sorta hemming and hawing‘ll haunt your boiler rooms abysmally
And kidnap rapid eyes in their infancy
Everything his cutting room scrapped
On a silver screen that throws gummy bears back, attack!

All these tribes hoard breads and wines
These climates transform men to swine
(AGAIN!)
All these hives hide knives and lead
These bribes can't transform swine to men

Sensible sweater on ice
Devil horns high
Like shovels above a butter lamb with peppercorn eyes
Vendetta-drunk leader squealing
"it's the real pig fever"
Sick people pinky swearing on concealed 6th fingers
That's idle handwork in the spirit of death dealers
Look at mommy's little Hercules
Custom Troy Hurtubise
Flourish in the blind spot of Spittle County 'Gore Police'
Or really any readily ebbing and flowing 'War and Peace'
1 plain brown key foods bag head
2 holes later I'll see to this loose flatbread
Cats fucked off, at exactly what cost
The currency of brotherhood back in his cut palm
It sucks, it's nauseating dawn crawling with bugs
They seem attracted to the matters ofthe morally snubbed
See my ‘Goodnight Irene' massacred flat in the key of tragedy
Whole diner like "i'll have what he's having"

All these tribes hoard breads and wines
These climates transform men to swine
(AGAIN!)
All these hives hide knives and lead
These bribes can't transform swine to men

Aggravated brain stick, motion sick
They peel back slow and expose the whole shit
Brain set drum speed to ultimate
Break bones in the throws of moments so ill

Today a thousand sea lions got up and left a pier
They had successfully invaded and secured for 20 years
Some said it was the food supply or shifting weather patterns
Truthfully a whole community of scientists are baffled
In '89 maybe 10 showed up at the wharf
As if guided by the trident of poseidon to cavort
Each a lumbering and boisterous glutton
Like a half-ton annoyance ‘til the heart-warming story went public
You'll need a montage, animals arriving in droves
A bottom dollar turns a nuisance to the pride of your cove
Which bring us back up to this morning when the colony dove
I got a couple unsubstantiated thoughts of my own they go
Maybe it'd feel more majestic and less fatty
If a 12 year old wasn't beaning it with salt water taffy
Every 5 fucking seconds, sounds like your basic
Liberating moment of collective "fuck fame" shit

All these tribes hoard breads and wines
These climates transform men to swine
(AGAIN!)
All these hives hide knives and lead
These bribes can't transform swine to menSome cats grow by the laws of the wild
Some learn slower and lag in the mud
Some stand up in defense of a style
Some let the big dogs eat them up
At exactly 11:35pm on January 21st I fell asleep sound
At exactly 11:35pm on Januray 21st some shit went down

[Aesop Rock]
Now Benny was a New York City graff kingpin
Five borough fame, guaranteed to itch pigskin
Raided near the Brooklyn Naval yard, juxed undercover
When they asked him what he pled he said, "You're fuckin' up my colors!"

[Mr. Lif]
Okay, Jose is working in the slaughterhouse
And he's living in the hood, but he wants to get his daughter out
Slipped off a ledge, and fell into a machine
Another dead immagrant, that's the American Dream

[Aesop Rock]
Miss Molly, helpless, made a penny with a data entry temp gig
Overqualified by the rent's thick
Red brick bash with a texted green screen
Like, "I entered my data right into your screen"

[Mr. Lif]
Jane went insane, she's an anchorwoman
Sick of pushing skewed information
And abusing the nation
Had a few options:
Either jump or run
Critical ways or waving a gun
Time for C-H-A-N-G-E
Held a knife to the VP on TV
She demanded that the format be expanded
Beyond fair, everybody clear, understand it?

[Aesop Rock]
Billy was a coke fiend
[Mr. Lif]
Maggie was a cop
[Aesop Rock]
For the dope he stole cream
[Mr. Lif]
She patroled the block
[Aesop Rock]
Banking off his old scheme
[Mr. Lif]
She recognized his plot
[Aesop Rock]
He thought he was home free
[Mr. Lif]
She knew that he was not
[Aesop Rock]
Now it's off to the jail in a blue squad car
[Mr. Lif]
She pocketed the crack before they got far
[Aesop Rock]
Billy watches Maggie from behind steel bars
Like "Where the crack went?"
[Mr. Lif]
"I'ma smoke it tomorrah"

[Aesop Rock]
They call him Larry Luck
Blackjack, big spender
He was married once
Till he bet her ring finger
Seen leaving Las Vegas
With a pick up truck, diamond
Fourty large, and beautiful wife piece
Less than what he came with
Hitched to the crib found nickels in the couch
Hitched back to the casino with in an hour
Said "I'm here to make a dollar out of fifteen cents"
And was immediately shot to his death over debts

[Mr. Lif]
As Colin died, his mama cried
Then the EMS arrived
Said that he could be revived but they lied
Afterlife realized that water from the skies
Washes pain from our eyes so our hopes could rise

[Aesop Rock]
Now, J.J. punch drunk, acts like a dumb fuck
Bum touched girls looking young enough to thumb suck
Once sought a life thought it right to rat him out
Now gets raped by Aryans in the big house (OUCH!)

[Mr. Lif]
Ted did 20 years for growing some weed
Although he used to snort coke and dabble with speed
Welcome home, homie, here's a blunt with hash
They said you know the rules bitch, take two and pass

Some cats grow by the laws of the wild
Some learn slower and lag in the mud
Some stand up in defense of a style
Some let the big dogs eat them up
At exactly 11:35pm on January 21st I fell asleep sound
At exactly 11:35pm on January 21st some shit went down

[Aesop Rock]
I got one Jack or Jill
Jill won't, Jack will
Jill didn't, then did it
Jack fell
No cellophane secrets, b
I guess I sense two felt bumps in the tar
No cell
But hell, you jump the bar so well
Parted your partners veil and dipped
I'm New York harbor
Tale of a sail, ripped sorta
Stuck on purpose for tha love of birthplace
But would have carried you home inside of my teeth anyday
Turns out I wasn't cast in the master plan anyway
He holds no grudge, holds his tongue, wow
Same one she used to hold in both smiles
Dagger the instinctual last shout if it killed me
So you can ride up in the sun city guilt-free
One year passed, the table is wobbling and your hollerin' back
Sippin the fits you skip when shit cracks
They never missed it
Not a long haul, bullshit, kids kicked into the sink
Shoebox, with a flicks of lipstick
I'll love you forever, cuz you know me better
For the record, at one time, would have married you in a second
But kill the rekindling dreams, and navigate the friendship
Or else by the time the stress wears out we'll both be dead and friendlessHunters with their dogs and deer rifles
Thousands of them line the pavement
Like patient pupae waiting to become worms

[Sample: Mr. Lif]
The people are dead, but the money keeps talking keep-keeps-keep-keeps talking
The people are dead, but the money keeps talking, keep
Keeps-keep-keeps talking

(Another dark night) Teething I'm marking a beast sheep
Like I walk in front of 39 thieves in a "v"
Smores over warm helvetica brown proper
For the odd God or monster, propped to teleprompter
Wild blue yonder, blue in the face, angel
Blew into the bugles in lieu of the euthanasia
Usually the shooter community chew the corpse
But I see the wolves have already gotten to you and yours
Day of the dead, play the ledge closely
Train a barrel of monkeys to aim at the lowest bogey
Dope the gonzo I've always felt choked socially
Stole the golden fleece with the culture of total nobodies
Earth rised, divided by fighting tribes
All we do is watch 'em waddle back and forth lighting fires
{Money money}
Detonator, wire cutter, pliers
Two cities enter, one is broken up in tiny tiles
And I wonʼt pose arm in the heart of the lionʼs throat
For a photographic token of my primordial growth
You parade around and kill, so damn proud
Like a flatline fetish, had it's feathers fanned out
War taught him symmetry, skipped into it gingerly
Silk worms ping-pong ministry to ministry
Hell's bells every which way the the wind blows
So I bang my head against any wall you can build, go

[Hook: El-P]
Another dark night, another not alright
Another bad ritual, more botched surgery
Better follow the bread crumbs back in fact, urgently
Or waddle through this section where the natives feel "murdery"
Vicinity wander, claim no soul
Never let an anchor drop
Never had a home, never talk to strangers
Never trust a friend
This is the life and the life will not end

Next time think
39 thieves are quicker than 40 winks...
Raise your drinks
39 thieves are quicker than 40 winks

We're not concerned with the community aloofness
Dude, we're animals, we just go where the most food is
Lower the toast, most formal etiquette is useless
Truth is you're equally expendable if spoon-fed
{Money money}
Money is cool, I'm only human
But they use it as a tool to make the workers feel excluded
Like the shinier the jewel the more exclusive the troop is
Bullets don't take bribes stupid, they shoot shit

(Another dark night)
Calicos tread around the rabbit hole
Weapons to the heavens and arsenic where the carrots grows
Piss warm sugar water wore the summer canteen
Plus burned rubber like "green is the new green"
Rubber neck froze, slows by the multiplex
Rodeo commotion, I'm open to see what culminates
Bougie on the right, left rep rebel force
Both say the feud will prove the parking lot was never yours
Black top pebble wars
Soldiers molded where the jonesʼs every grown-up
Wants decoded came to grow in
No motive, it showed up in gross quotas
Hog barn burner come see if your homes hold us
Eighty-five rattle-trap parked and fancy
You could swear he was stepping out of Comanche, antsy
Let us in the jetty when they jettison the medicine
And paranormal hatchet and cadets to break the levees in
{Money money}
Both know the totem camaraderie
Token of equality, they post it horizontally
Chronicle the loading dock, they crawl to lodge the colony
Half-mast flags, half caps stole the properly
And sleep the sleep of the just ready on the left
Where the witchcraft spun out of a neighboring sect
With the usual undesirables and the big brother cutters
On the day your name became "This Motherfucker?"

This-is-the-lifeI was sitting on my fire escape and I saw
Sturdy bridges, decorated with dirty pigeons
A vagabond begging for three pennies and a princess
A junkie tourniquet surgeon urging the needle in
A batty senior citizen flashing that awful teethless grin
I saw a corner store merchant rest on a milk crate with a stog'
A pierced nose, a model with a stalker, cheap hooker, jay walkers
A table on a sidewalk with four old men slappin' dominos down
A city, a village, a neighborhood, a ghost town
I saw vandals catching tags and Puerto Rican flags
I saw a pregnant woman on the verge of bursting
I saw a blind man with a dog screaming someday I'll see it all
And then he sat down with his hammer and saw
Business men with multi-colored ties, cashing their checks
A Nazi with tattoos on his neck, a Vietnam War vet
A Caucasian man with a limp and a cane, a pimp with his dames
A thug circus, a pack of shook tourists hugging their purses
I saw freaks with rainbow streaks in dayglo hair
A mother smackin' the grin off her child, replaced it with a stare
A pothole, a storefront with a broken open sign
A hole in the wall bar kicking drunks to the gutter, it's closing time
I see a fuck up, a bum knuckle up with a taxi driver
A squatter, a grandfather, an angry right-to-lifer
I can see the roof garden on the apartment across the street
And kick myself because somewhere along the way I lost my seeds
I see a rat, a roach, a bat approach, a happy student
A black man with a horn and a will to make you sit and listen to it
I see a little girl on the corner with bubbles, braids and barrettes
I see a teen mother with Similac, pacifier, and regrets
Oh, a day turned stale, a hammer with a rusty nail, a failed marriage
A universe of brick buildings slightly off balance
A challenge, I see a chance to add real colors to my favorite palette
Raise my mighty mallet towards the gods and swing my talents
I see a crack in the sidewalk
A slide show of sick civilians gripping bottles like idiots
Sitting inside bent meridians
There's a fun house ooh, a sun spout
Spraying yellow beams above yellow back dreams
And children in the hydrants
Hybrids, I see sirens
The wall to the glamor standard
A dead bird, a red curb
A bus stop where commuters wait to have their souls towed off to work
I see the slapdash habits of bike messengers pausing
To huff that good leaf on the way to damage packages for peddlers
Oh my lord, I see bandwagons, all aboard
A carnival amusement park where a heart is a luxury
I see a gas galaxy huddled behind those pearly doors
Maybe I should sit up on my fire escape a little more(What's up this is Aesop Rock for WKCR)

I traded my title as bent pedestrian for passenger status to coast muted
Finding the night train mildly therapeutic
Rugged hacker flashing mood full of swings
Beneath this puppet master pulling my strings
Leaking smoke rings singing [your despite what measured honestly magnificent]
Syndicate sold to children building homes for my omnipotent platoons
Nah I don't think the blueprints drafted tilted in the tombs
Tampering hampered scampered well beyond the dooms
We bloomed? the matter down to those most beautifully discrete
Applying yesterdays models stand obsolete amongst colossals [amongst colossals]
Comply not to enforce us aborted claiming they came off
Sort of stabbed them with the capital 'A' that sets my name off
Sick of it all
Sick of the stalls
Sick of the thick brick in the wall sob stories the falls the tragic hate calls
Shaking like magic eight balls pausing to watch the vapors crawl
My clique heeds lessons I'll be noted from kids sisters paper dolls
We lining up along against these great walls
Circling analytical
Rhetorical inquiries yet x is not applicable kid
(Your flash minor we as orphans repeated)?
You're talkin' concrete examples with glass bottoms cause defeated kid I'm heated
Its flight of the intruder and we all fall down
Conditions of never blends science with religion
Cut my character cleansed in esoteric opulence
But finding no intrinsic merit in your sense
Well isn't that bewildering
Drunken distortion and spit the filter in
Mic sweltering measures like melting my rings together an you never
Seen I Aesop Rock flop for the love of eighty-nine point nine
I'm here to ride upon the night train

[Yeah WKCR 89.9 . . . here for the night train . . . whats up to my man

Zoom in to the fuming of an aggravated breed
Via the study of post-adolescent agitated seeds
Half the patients wasted self prior to Commencement
So I focus on the urban Oxygen samples, the half that made it breathe
They sold Pompeii impression, waste infections
And twelve steps to lesson
Cretins swiftly tippy toe on hard to swallow, barter concepts
The give-it get-it, never let it self passport our stubbornness
Martyrs talks money causes in a harvesting Spartacus
And so on I've thrown long Hail Mary bombs
Toward cookie-cutter Mother Natures bedazzled synthetic fabrics
Life treats the peasants like
They tried to fuck his woman while he slept inside
Well they're merely chasing perfectionist emblems
When the clock strikes nine
I'll be waking with the best of routine caffeine team players
For the cycle of it
Under a dusted angel heart string Big Brother is watching
My odometer like buzzard to fallen elk, talking stealth
We got babies, rubber stamps, and briefcase parts
We on some door-to-door now
Order ten dollars or more, we'll shove it down your throat for free
I'll sacrifice my inborn tendencies
For copper pennies for one commanding "Gimme that"
So we can retain baby fat
Make the biter snake bedlam
Holocaust freak, heckle shiesty brain headroom shaped planet
Make a move, pause, make a move break cannon
Bent barrel one eight zero, you'll turn, squeeze, ending
It's on like it's never been
It's bleeding well
It's bigger than a breadbox
It corrodes my leaky finance
I'll take my seat atop the Brooklyn Bridge
With a Coke and a bag of chips
To watch a thousand lemmings plummet just because
The first one slipped
Sometimes I laugh at victory, kissing these little question marks
I tend to underestimate my average
Just another bastard savage
Someday you'll all eat out of my cold hand
Cuz every dog has its day
At which point, I'll pull it away

[Hook]
Now we the American working population
Hate the fact that eight hours a day
Is wasted on chasing the dream of someone that isn't us
And we may not hate our jobs
But we hate jobs in general
That don't have to do with fighting our own causes
We the American working population
Hate the nine-to-five day-in day-out
When we'd rather be supporting ourselves
By being paid to perfect the pastimes
That we have harbored based solely on the fact
That it makes us smile if it sounds dope

[Verse 2]
It's the year of the silkworm
Everything I built burned yesterday
Let's display the purpose that these stilts serve
Elevate the spreading of the silk germ
Trying to weave a web but all that I believe in is dead
Nah brother, it's the year of the jackal
Saddle up on high horse
My torch forced Polaris embarrassed
Shackle up the hassle by the dooming legend marriage
I bought some new sneakers
I just hope my legacy matches
It's the year of the landshark
Dry as sand, parched, damn get these men some water
They're out there being slaughtered
In meaningless wars so you don't have to bother
And can sit and soak the idiotbox trying to fuck their daughters
Man it's the year of the Orphan
Seated adjacent to the firefly circling the torches on your porches
Trying to guard the fortress of a king they've never seen or met
But all are trained to murder at the first sign of a threat
Maybe it's the year of the waterbug
Cockroach utter thug specimen
Fury spawned from dreaming of your next of kin
I'm still dealing with this mess I'm in
I've been the object of your ridicule
You've been a bitch lieutenant
God, it's the year of the underpaid employee
Spittin' forty plus a week
And tryin' to rape Earth on my off time
You bored dizzy, I can't keep myself busy enough
So you can run run run
And I'mma let you think you won
EVERYBODY!

Aesop Rock (Aesop Rock)

[Verse 1]
Is a love such as that which I exhibit for my practice
The factor which then amalgamates debates with straight-jackets and robes
Huddled in brackets that blacken the average globe
Xenophobe, loathe to modify the fly, feel this..

I carve a notch in my wall for every stall
Every fifth mark slants diagonal to symbolize your downfall
Drunky peasants, honor the shifty Megatron presence
Slug a bolt once ceremonies of merit turn bloodsport

Voted hella high seas, I freeze your mega dumb company
Pumping out wise beads like, fly sneak-attacks on dry leaves, dunce
Crooked rumors turn zoomers when rookies talkin'
Bad seeds blossom the Wookiee walk. Hawk and

Let a sucker drift, I lift up every stone prone to find
The point at which repellent signals ultimately bind
When a pack of style mimics see my brains target the cluster
I advance clutchin' the mic like bully to knuckle duster

And ascend. Your riddles yield a little plastic blend
Fuck a badge, light a bonfire dancin' jig around the pig
Figurin' yeah, I'll land a plane on bleached-stained trackers
Usin' only the finest and post-modern terrain mappers

Once my brethren disperse
My god, you think the heavens touched the earth then
Thirstin' a perch on a bursted curse
But I don't. Confide: wine and water chose me
Bored: lasso down Polaris, let the glow amuse me

Ok, I lay me down to sleep, creepin' a slumber under red skies
Heads splittin', straight sippin' a drip of dead vibes
It's red tides from here, stop and smell analog hell
Clenchin' a stench of burnin' logics and a child with yearning optics

Now someone's approached the rope, shaken like snow-globes
Other sought safety in numbers, other's flows got towed under (Yeah)
Still another took a turn and crashed and burned while others flee
But there will never be another starvin' marvel like me

See, there's a time when... rhyme and...
Paint combined can't even manage to tell what the swell is like
Picture your imagery embellished
With the hellish aspects of the swarms' forlorn facets

Soul crafted fact cats, boroughin', left perennial tenants discouraged in
Discussin' my four seasons flourishing, uh!
Searching, perching, poetic lead poison
Poised in ploys to leak a little bit of moisture on your pride

I'm a animated style machine intervening faulty production fueled by nicotine suction
From ducks in my carnival to vipers in my garden
You flash identify by the genus, species and class. Start to chuckle

Buckle the architecture til it fell through
Kill the survivors then raise the dead for shock value
By the time the pending settlement's fully negotiated (yeah I'll...)
I'll have put aside a few to get myself situated

So like sadly, my style spooks juveniles like Boo Radley
Radically weak assume the colonel Kurtz in our platoon soon enough
That's one bluff call, toughens the searcher
Stuttering, emerging, gutter urchin, bursting

I live for the moment of truth when Big Willie rapper
Acknowledges failure and states "Goddamn my shit is trash"
"It's time to let go." Tin man banging upon his chest to hear the echo
(Heartless, kid. Hollow compartments.)

Be we the people of the united, starving artistic
Militia keep movin' in order to form a more perfect union
I'm cluing into the poison panoramics brew the panic situations
It fucks a little with my brittle gift

I tell myself "Stay" (Stay)... up high
Make a mockery of sun and moon and star 'till they hand over the sky
My de luxe is, fluxes, pivots to where the crux is
Invade the town while village elders holler "Who the fuck's this?"

See: hipper cats aggravated, trudge through the muds
Quicken ones, plots thicken like, coagulated blood
Rugged serpentine climb, pebble to rock
Let your pretty pink cloud nine expectations please you not

I'm, Ae-*fucking*-sop Rock, mic bizarro
Proper application of the soul by my standard
Candid once position from which instigations spawn
And man, I plan to die with a mic in my hand, it's like...

Abandon all hope y'all, abandon all hope, it's like
Abandon all hope y'all, abandon all hope...Intro:
"Who the fuck is Ace Rock?"

Verse 1:
Automatic whip deck
Food for the stiff necks
Alpha demeanor crunk but a flunky on the piss test
Soundtracker Cip One
Hands like vinyl killers that’ll run around
And cut them dubplates down to 7-inches
And I Jukie Ace
Boogie face
First do it from the base of the Six Flags
Def Jux movement
And he Jukie Cip
Boogie mixtape hustle
Push consecutive classic materials for new Jet Jungles
See Bazooka with his arms folded
Fists balled up
Called up Ox to ride the European tour bus
See me in your city where the mics turn blue
For the crew don’t let the fuckin’ stage breathe 'til we through
Insidious dirt funk litterbug in the New York chronicle form phenom slang
Peep the game
Keep the fame
Leap the chains
Or better yet I’ll start this motherfucking revolution
Keep the change
It goes peace to the Atoms
What? Add ‘em up
Crypt, Jest, Wind, Vast, Vor, Cip, Alaska
Eye at his worm chopper
Fingers on the fader
And he’s faded if the fingers made the dutch burn proper
I let 'em crowd the new record the fuck up for the sensors
You don’t know what you forgot, you’ll remember in September
It’s gonna make these little style-biting Fraggles lasso they dentures
Learning innovation mixed with inherent respect for mentors
The antiplane buffing or stuffing throwies down your throat
Can ya feel it? That’s rough rugged raw
Fuck a sealed kiss
Fee fie fo fum smell the dummy tears
I’m ghost, Cip take us the fuck up outta here

[Verse 1: Open Mike Eagle]
Look one day I won't even need a barber
I'll buy a new jeep and sleep in a pizza parlor
Every cheap cigar is the best they could probably do
Limited resources plus other hobbies too
Imagine bad guys tied to fire wagons
Also apple pies and spies and sky dragons
Sociopaths choke who they supposed to hug
Midnight vultures love appropriating culture clubs
I like one clean tape fuck the overdub
And then I record seventeen singing parts
Deep yoga love supposed to be a secret art
Downward dog, hips straight with the feet apart
Still the beating heart rebuilt the leaning part
Cheap thrilled, feet build and kill with a cuisinart
The prodigal done is home from the lecture tour
I count three, who's the fourth table setting for?

[Sample]

[Verse 2: MarQ Spekt]
They saying Spekt, why you chewin' like a rabid dog?
If he can't keep it what the hell you let him have it for?
That's your fault but y'already lack the gravitas
These phantom bars leave 'em floating like the planet Mars
A saboteur and booby traps throughout the catalogue
Stab 'em in the stomach, lift the blade and twist the handle off
Yeah, then leave some munchies for the weed heads
I like it better when y'all listen more, speak less
The look in her eyes will tell you that she eat fresh
Murdered the punani feeling guiltier than G-Dep
That's why they see em, he won't even give 'em a look
Casting lines off that rusty old fisherman hook
Kind of shocked they fell for the newest trick in the book
'Cuz it ain't really nothing more than a considerate jux
From a good polite kid who used a mask and a gun
Told his pops you only out to get that capital one
Ain't mean to kill him, we was just having some fun
Found his body vacuum sealed like a package of drugs
Praise a nimrod, when he blast immaculate slugs
And showed no honor for your honor turn his back to the judge
That's why they stay being ugly and repugnant
I almost beat 'em half to death with a drumstick
Save your assumptions, they really ain't want shit
And keep it hard as three pretty mouths on one dick

[Sample]

[Verse 3: Aesop Rock]
He got the beetles in his pinky
Every leader venal
The face line ate, I ain't street legal
Lead a pale horse in a ear tag some deer ticks
A winged horse to a queen's air strip, flares lit
Cut his own hair, chew his own chain
Might bang on a bucket with a lucite cane
Screws loose, quicker than a pit crew up fish news
Eighty-eight with a eighty-six feud[?]
Litter in the street, tricky slither in the mildew
Swamp thing, chop chop [?] mosh king
POP go his temper, knock knock the fenders
Peck bound plots under cosmic embers
I'm a hot mess get your squad sequestered
Dock death, sleep on a bed of hot cobwebs
Freak with a set of goth potheads
Bleed rocks and fail smog checks

[Sample][Verse 1: Blueprint]
I spit with an immense amount of power
Sparks flame showers, cowards, cower, underneath our
Storm clouds that indicate the acid rain hours
Now or, never, ever, ending on a bad note
Ripping a crab's throat, for spitting a bad quote
(Blueprint what's your approach?)
I smash black folk and white folk alike for jokes with mics
And make a Kodak moment out of the most boring open mic
I'll make a sad fan appreciate rap again
Fuck around and forget just how whack it's been
I'm a bad man (Why's that?)
I catch bullets in my molars, body slam boards
And take flight with the weight of the world on my shoulders
And blame David Blaine on any chains that hold us
What started out as food for thought
Turned into thoughts to turnin' crews into food in hopes to satisfy my
Insatiable appetite to dine on lifeforms
Small planets and satellites
Your solar system is my condiment;
I vomit comets, and don't sweat the small things and nonsense
Every dog has his day and even more so in rhyming
So I decided that I'd never play the fire hydrant
Or grab the mic sounding lazy, worn down and tired;
Cats don't really fall off they just get uninspired
But before you, get a reason to ever diss us
I'll drop an ill LP and disappear like Bobby Fischer
But this is, the building block of all that is
And what it is, is Alchemy

[Chorus: Aesop Rock & Blueprint]
Alchemy, basic with a touch of wild wonder
Alchemy, we made this to take your style under
Metal frame, walking through a metal game with a limp, tight grip
Determined not to let time slip
This is Alchemy, iron b-boy and all its glory
Alchemy, hold it from the colder sob story
Metal frame, walking through a metal game with a limp; tight grip
Determined not to let time slip

[Aesop Rock]
(Ah) Dirty, dirty destiny;
Dirty murders with a burnt version of peasantry
Nervous flux flirtin' with hurly burly chemistry
Graffiti burner urchin merchant with a certain urge to jerk and serve your centerpiece
My zig-zag bully balance gallops with a fiery outline
Ban and bomb y'all pastel poets belly up (I'll tell you what)
One style in 4 dimensions count 'em:
Three to take 'em to ya muck, one to build a world you'll never touch
And I'm a pilot, delirium, serum, poison arrangement
Come browse through an idyllic storm and suck the raw enslavement
With a grim-style stinger creeping out the basement
Encased in wild ritualistic visions of sacrificial bitch cadence
For all my iron giant soldiers with a metal fist up, shielding mother nature
From a fatal wrist cut, story: I respect you
(So why they blaming you for the cats that sleep while the earth turns?)
Yeah I had em' up all night praying I'd re-release Music For Earthworms
Breathe deep and I lean, squeamish grip milestone like ring ring ring I just
Caught the Scream Phoenix click dial tone
Welcome to a cloud twelve brutal hallucination war pillar
Carnivore, carnival, karma slasher
I dash like a jackrabbit that orbits revelation with a single pounce
To Edward Scissorhands your string of doubts (Yo turn it out)
This is that Mighty Casey homefield advantage to bend your blizzard
With a crocodile smile and five robot knuckles to your kisser
This is

(Chorus)Boy in the box, the fever is all day, boy in the box, the fever is all day, boy in the box, the fever is all day, boy in the box, the fever is all day, boy in the box, the fever is all day, boy in the box, the fever is all day, boy in the box, the fever is all day, boy in the box, the fever is all day...

When I'm in effect, the days are all strange, boy in the box, the fever is all day
When I'm in effect, the days are all large, fire for the people the summer is all ours
When I'm in effect, the days are all grim, too alive once the chips are all in
When I'm in effect, the days are all close, woke up new, the city was all ghost
When I'm in effect, the days are all new, five in the sky, the muddy is all you
When I'm in effect, the days are all wild, food in the streets and clean-up in all aisles
When I'm in effect, the days are all peep, grown by his own, provoked the wrong sheep
When I'm in effect, the day is all raw, ten little workers, nine were all talk
Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk...

Boy in the box, the fever is all day, boy in the box, the fever is all day, boy in the box, the fever is all day, boy in the box, the fever is all day, boy in the box, the fever is all day, boy in the box, the fever is all day, boy in the box, the fever is all day, boy in the box, the fever is all day...

Ease on down to the marketplace
Scope out anything with markerstains
The bus-stop glass like a targetface
Cap the delay where the archers aim
Ease on down to the catacomb
Crash into another man's babylon
No matter which path y'all travel on
We spin this city in a gravitron
Ease on down to the marketplace

Ease on down to the catacomb
Crash into another man's babylon
No matter which path y'all travel on
We spin this city in a gravitron

Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay...

Broke noose with a movie feud, in the same old feed
No news is new
Most soup on the food he grew, put a mouth full of crumbs
No news is new
Old troop with a loopy crew, but the skies ain't blue
No news is new
No flu had a loopty-loop, might slip into the stew

No news is new, no news is new, no news is new, no news is new, no news is new, no news is new, no news is new, no news is new, no news is new, no news is new, no news is new, no news is new, no news is new, no news is new...

Fire in the sky with a focused temper
Two sides know it as a noble gesture
All the kings men let the poison fester when the knucklehead choir sang "No surrender,"

What a pretty light show you both have rendered
Put a strain on the number of folk contending
Aim for the gallery of open hecklers when the knucklehead choir sang "No surrender,"

All in all ...

All star navigate blood-bath circuit...circuit
All city wolf pack'll arm all servants...service
All and all cut from similar scissors and surgeons...circus
All machines murder if the herders merked nervous...nervous
In around em all in all out pedigree centipede maladjusted curb purge all binge
All out a machine with cog misalignment - shooting star
Eight-ball all alien appendage out his cookie jar


These are not his office hours
What he coughs is mandatory
Three obnoxious hawks and howlers
Roughly buff the categories
Twenty broad shoulders, all sober, all circuit-prowler
And matador electric tongue stung at sergeant markers sour
Who the fuck, needle Jux property
Chickens've all been
Soaked under the water works, all other birds evolve with me
Duck and a phoenix and rout behemoth architecture out the jungle
Where my condors can reorganize their numbers

All day pool party and journalism Zion
And bazooka flash the grin she decorate the closest Nikon
Bazooka flash the molars decorate the close Minoltas
Canon Hasselblad quicker than Polaroid exposures


If open voltage leads all funny play tip the fuddy duddy fuck long come on
Get your stolen drums on
All of y'alls all dumb out pimping art like a whore's box
And all of y'alls all couldn't rap your way out of a card-board box
Get high now, solidify your zone
And let the medallion of spiritual accomplishments keep growing


Oh snagglepussy getting pushy mushing dirt up in the gears like
Aesop Rock is all ears


All in together now
Dear lord holler at me
All i know is hell is down and god don't cover doctoral fees
No phases all over civility like greased-up baby groins
But I will not stand for the flipping of a weighted coin


Suck we are the new now colony all mangy-like
Radar for the crazy oink
Keep winning for later joint

All for one and one for all and justice for all and fiddlin' with dead mice
Only toughens the claws, my all systems go will be perceiving dystopian civil war
Steal a meal to the last tickle in your jaw
All clammy all-state labor day committee folk
Got busy worker ants intimidate the sitting duck

And that my good people is my piece
All in one manual
There's only one in all the shaking hands you do

I'll trade the pound for pennies opus, I don't need it
Fuck now look y'all heed it[Looped sample]
"When I'm in a re-no-vative state of mind I'm innovative"

[Verse 1: Aesop rock]
It’s like antisocial
Hazardous portion organically nourished
Courage to flourish in music's orphans
Lunge nicotine dream missing link weariest
Caution we proclaim till brain’s arch like Sagittarius Shield
Yield to the eyes as mescaline killin' fields
Rise groggy stone gaze marching moodily
'til ... plural styles amalgamated beautifully
Rudely awoke,sing rubber-glue conglomerates
Sucking up love
While brushing parasitic critics to my left side
I test glide
Kamikaze crash distort that's on my preface (check)
The therapeutic unit recommended
Now slow-mo Quasimotos teeter on ringleader status
While I spit satellite photos while teetering on the stratus
Sleepwalking the atlas after none.
Trudge and nudge my ninety-nine octane brain
To one-oh-one
Run to organize my mood
Like cauterize my wound and climb up
Lovely samaritans line up like bar codes
For a fraction of my factions
The hollow of his hand beholds contraptions via
Amplified files collapsed your cacophonic' conquest. My specs up
Morph hostile and docile insubordinance your phylum
Core data asylum swarmes' your coordinates. Rush
Must not sleep, must warn others
I’ll tourniquet your turbulence
Then trample on your stutters
If I could displace every vagrant in America
With traces of my character
The Earth would be a more pitiful habitat
With infinite acres of auto-cry intricate nature
Swung open the nomenclature to obscure warlock trickery.Pure
Hazmat got tossed back by liquors supporting patience
Working knuckles for audio duplication
That’s like fiending for a purpose

[Looped sample]

Aesop Rock, prototype Robocop
Jabberwocky rocking on the highest hilltop
I possess two siamese styles that’s like connected at the mic hollering monstrous
Poly-tech impede indidgy progress, deaf
Swept off your meridian. It’s operation Start With a Slummy Raped Your Milk and Honey
Can I like, conjure up like all potent components of like
Middle siblings scribbling on his lonesome like
Hit him with my ninety-nine metal plated mics upon the wall, take em' down, pass em'round, rock em' all. Bust it
I’m forever building my City of Lost Children ripping rungs off your ladder at a
Sardonic smirk. Ebonics lurking where the crop circles got stamped out from the rain dance
Tsunami rain blast lift off like origami cranes and sloppy braincasted class-a-piece mastered to capture your flag then flutter
While slaves defy water sucked through from paper bags
The magic-maker dragging devils to add triple sixes melt the triple glitches on your console
I calibrate my mics prior to claimin' shit is rockable
Unlock and pull a backdoor for the bounce
While cannily panicking was the average. I broadcast modern boredom mesozoic poetry pupils
Caught up in scruples from the inimical nature of my program
Elegantly overcast password curse an a tactless bastard
Catatonic until personal practice mastered

[Looped sample][Verse 1]
APPLESEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED!
Yeah, yeah, I recall the
First time I bumped heads with my head led to a dead bargain, a
"Thanks for nothin, lowlife" and a start of, "Beg my pardon,"
When a dust mite harbored spite it barely
Dents the cicada phase, blades averted
Decorate the backs of freedom fighters, servants pick those
Steeples higher, man the loose cannons
"Pannin for gold?" Nah panning for chance to land in camps branded with
"Push" stamped on their hand lets
Push, let's push up through the
Now, let's evoke a vow of
Zipped lips clipped to my peaking
Brow, I'm sleeping now, I seen immaculate hearts blemished
Under the mass of genie bottle hostages who wish that a
Third to her broken promises
Black spot of Gotham, fragile
Castle and master passageway
Even the innocent captives bleed
Bleed appleseed apple seed, leave me with a breeding
Hassle factor's feet
Pin the tail on the village idiot
Turn giddy click stern greet a burn it basics laid with the
Modes of neurotic nitpicking
Patrons and their pseudo potent
Patronage, ahh mood of the moment
Gloated in splendor of its
Greatness and I'm hella swamped
Truly moody in my days makeshift awakeness
Act as if apathy's been your best friend since the bonding
I'll one up you with love letters from despondency
Honestly appleseed..
Yeah![Aesop Rock] 3x
Every little step we take breaks the dreams
Of a war pig itching to re-stitch the seams

[Vast Aire]
Namsayin, when I walk, I wanna break concrete!

Ox will spit some shit that'll reflect off the mirror
My light beams are mad bright, they stay clever
Yo, challenge an Ox member, get a valve severed
Found your body in the desert (Scavenger's dessert)
Yeah yeah I rap tight like Saran
Plus enter battles talkin shit like "Look mom, no hands"
I'm tired of cats tryin to sum me
You can't add that far yet, that counting is far fetched
I treat MC like K-9s
Throwin words at they face to see if they bite when they catch
I told you my poetry sponsors Gillette
Now you standing there wit razors in your head like barrettes
Man, if the mic had ass cheeks
The sticker in my hand would say priority seating
And man, I don't know if it was me or you
But your girl was on my dick like she was teethin'
You play the role, I'll play the poppy seed on top of you
The godspeed is actual, that doesn't mean I act usual
One of the first MC's to give the crowd full attention
Cuz you need love and affection

[Hook: Aesop Rock, Vast Aire] 2x

If we could absorb every star in the sky
We noticed some shine brighter than others, you wonder why
It's the simple things in life that turn the peasants into leaders
And we know the differences between the walkers and the sleepers

[Aesop Rock]
I boogie with picketer vision, carbon based stickler
City piss aroma, therapy coma, clone sitter
Itching to pigeon hole villain soul magnet
Feelers activate
Passion ate the germ, and the book met the worm
I hold a book of matches captive to flash if
The sunbeams flatline
Via thick fatigue episodes, brewed in batches
The flirt of cursed perks nursed broken skeleton patches
One muddy veteran collapsed the untapped resource center
Housing style pageants
My little limbs lasso katydid wings
While mankind's babysteps break dirt and demon
I know a crossbreed strung well in the key of
Mass times weight times tamed semantics
Encompassing that which splits lips but never supplied the bandage
To hell wit plastic, we edit splendid
Tap it on the shoulder, grab it, tag it, apprehend it
Lend it to the devil to befriend it, wrench it back, mend it again
It still never renders suspended 'bove finicky picket fences
Now every droid dreams to manufacture hearts
Start with cadaver parts and a blueprint
He followed the precedent set by war pigs of a yesteryear
Let the tears braid
And skip a stone over the reservoir to shake the whole charade
Gold-plated tomb or spittoon
I couldn't see
I fell asleep holding an Appleseed, woke up holding a tree
The only bridge I ever burned along this legacy I dance
Was the one that linked the cities of Prosperity and Chance

Chorus 2xRadio? Check, check
Video? Check, check
This is how the city folk and mole-people connect
Somebody warped the message prior to passin it to the next
Now the perforated counties making you upset

Harvest all Brand-X Clark Kents to worm food
Carbon heart buried his nozzle in fossil marker art
Pardon, cadaver had a legitimate pulse
And littered volts all over the village where the skittish pigeons molt
Bastard polter gasps when the pigeon with Lazarus billy-goat whiskers
He roasted sea-salt in the open blisters
But blind anarchy slips through the cracks
See naked martyrs with Bubblelicious on fishing rods itching to pull it back
When that organic invention incubated to hatch some comply to making fructose on paper now
Apply the details later and the clues will taper out
Unruley mayor souse, who piggy jammy happy shooting at the bladed mouth
Bazooka Tooth zoo-keep the paper route with janky funds and favors
Cradled by twelve empty Zelda heart containers
Man, it's freezing in this brick bitch, winter forever
Like Punxatawny Phil found with his four furry wrists severed
I walk face-first through the sex, drugs, and church
With wild things that make Maurice Sendak question his early works
But no hostages, no promises
Out to clock corporate cogs and sprockets
Not clogs, all grommets
Running from a rabid ring-wraith click basilisk
Serpentine, in and out of traffic jam and murder scenes
Scrub blood of the AF1s 52 Pick-up first degrees
Some toddlers smuggled tommy guns and crack into the nurseries
Dog, there's a fucking baby at the door asking for wallets
And those ain't twin Beanie Babies inside his pockets
2010's sonograms showed the magnum formed directly out the fetus
Evolution for the young killer convenience

Somebody's losing track and their flesh and blood's in arrest
Polka-dotted landscapes, what did you expect

Now adays, even the babies got guns
Diaper snipers having clocktower fun
Misplace the bottle, might catch a bad one
Have a mid-life crisis when you're ten years young

If this Jesus piece around your neck is bigger than your pistol
It makes homicide okie-dokie and your god will forgive you
Just show the saints at Heaven's gate
You should be on the list
I hear he overlooks manslaughter for a tattooed crucifix
Twisty, fishy, contradicty, wild animal ship fleet
Off the sliding board dock of the Mr. Turtle pool mom bought
Somewhere they laminate dry bones in cool water and ease medulla
After you thumb suck and diaper change, get burped and shoot the school up
I'd duel too, but only to exploit no-brainers
Teenager beef passed alligator teeth and extra-curricular flagpole scrapping
Amongst tadpoles it happens
Yellow backbone de-mechanism brought airborne shrapnel scraps to hassle captains
By the itchy index of an umbilically garbed fraggle baby
Fragile maybe, you think?
Chopped shopin a mislead, maladjustee trustee locked box
Hiding clips that light the sky in seconds
Like fuel and communal hop-scotch gives them leverage
Cuddle with mortars while I mumble
In the immortal slang of mushmouth for the anti-led Nirvana
I used to think I'd get hit by a bus or something Dumb and Dumber
Now the bus is slugs plugged by the newest kiddie thug wonder
Suffixed to kings, he rebel, wide pride dosage
For tomorrow the holsters are bound to outnumber the roaches
I'm not a coach
But that'll even jolt the immobile
When global terrorism's all the rage, your folk get smoked local
Block, if you need me (Yeah?)
I had to bounce to D.C. (Yeah?)
To bullet-proof mom's flower garden before the war cheats me (Yeah?)
If I'm not back in a week tell the crew I said peace and lay low
Strays don't vacate slow

The day
I
Got the phone call
Jam Master Jay died
So no, I'll probably never write another Daylight
Because the stingers tend to cling more than the portable hay-rides
It adds it up when a pioneer fall
In comparison to your ninety-nine bottle of beer wall
There's banana peels in your hamster wheels
Hand-cannons in your shoe box
Please
Mine's got Adidas
Rest in peaceThese wings have seen things most men would melt apart from
It's like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
All my drunk destiny pushed was one radio flyer chock-full of halo parts
Ringin this chime like, "Man, I could fix your broken shine
We're all Saints swept serpentine 'round charcoal tomorrow
Bunk holiday damned. Easy now, brother, I'm here ...
I'm here, I'm now, then and there.  I'm, we?  Us?  Them?  It?
I'm sorry, I'm ...
God, this final extension's beautiful but, friend, I don't deserve it
I beg of you sweet Father please detach my chest's polar lining
I can't handle asymmetry
And if it means my grand finale don't tally the votes
Finish me, dormant, with torture-machine silencer-piece
Positioned where eyelids will reach R.E.M. well before I'm torn
I've never asked for much (Never) never felt golden-benefit worthy
I gots what I gots and what I don't gots don't concern me
I'm no model, I never aspired to be Velociraptor fossil
Man, there wasn't no arrangement
Man, I never had a say in this
I wanna be the normalcy that normalcy was jealous of
No shimmer, no celestial flight mid-winter
Enter me now
See through Cretin low-life iris
(Uh, I, I'm, I'm not, I'm not ready) I'm not ready for all this business that for some reason you all refer to as a privilege
Uh, take a look at me, my feathers drag, this harp plays out of tune
I fly about as straight as a blind tugboat through my legacy
I accidentally killed cupid with his own weaponry
And man that was my homie
Talk about not cut out for these pristine pearly robings
What could I possibly have done? You really want me to steer child populace back on beaten path?
Oh god, like teachin morals!
I can't be a part of something I ain't soaking my feet in, man
I'm from the dungeon So from here on out it's hark the herald nothing
Listen, I quit.  That's it
But for the life of me, one thing has plagued my being from the get-go
Why place these most blessed and sacred honors upon an alley cat like this
I just don't get it
Oh... my god, it just dawned on me... wait a second, oh... god...

[2x]
You have been a witness
You have seen the days when
I applied lies in a billion different ways, and now I harbor bad karma
Doomed to cope with the fact I dodged the ring but gotta show these cats the ropes


Bad karma
Please leave these little wings to erode
Please leave this little halo to a child with a lighter load
I'mma hold this tight like a life lesson told through a micTelevision, all hail grand pixelated god of
Fantasy, murder scape bent perspective
Fuck a sore channel changed digit
I sit with a nasty network intravenous plan
With a stable diet of my cable pirate
Yo, the doctor is in, the doctor is on
Born the bastard son of static radiance cloned to welcome in every home
Lead a blue screen, bruised dream canopy
Victim of the cursed nursed Technicolor drunk support team
Ooh, I love all advertisements
Though accused by robot news casters who capture and pollute
Spoon fed hazardous fog to joy luck catholic squad
Please take me, please calm me, please make me a zombie
Please I want to donate my brain to the monstrous Panasonic profit
Now, twenty first century plagued
Dispersed to wide eyed glamour addict patients
Telecast patrons
Blue be the propaganda banners, well, sure I'll be a Marine
With a clean sword and blue uniform, it only takes a dollar and a dream
And I abide great idiot box power supply, fuzz vapor
Black out of New York, hey honey, get the generator
I'm in a doom, doom generation, pacin', ancient electric secret
Never sleepin' to miss the AM oasis
My name is a wired heart, sloppy obligation
Turn my stilt into my guilt and have a chatter box blame frame adjacent station
Make reality scrambled and suck the life out of a hidden vandal
And loving every minute of the gimmick, change the channel

Plug it in, turn it on, prop me up against the couch
Lights out, I ain't ever gonna have to leave my house
Satellite dish, get up on my wish list, turn me to a tyrant
Let my clean spirit dissolve through the appliance

Plug it in, turn it on, be my mother when she's gone, great
Wipe the spittle off my chinny-chin during the breaks
If I gotta go blind I'mma do it for the love of all television kind
And that's fine, and that's fine...

Make me a star, I wanna touch gold
Hold me suspended in a dream, merely inches from the screen
Deleted passions sacrificed to one electron monster
Crucify my little future to the monitor
Damn it feels good, turn on, tune in
Zoom in to hug the bug up in your family function
But the children seem to love it
Yes mother, me and wild discovery
And heard the static flock to where I sleep
By the glow of that magic box big speaker
Stereo mastered often kill the freak seekers, eyes spiraling
Tangled in the star spangled wiring
I can turn from toxicated visuals
And all the kings horses abort the loyalty to royalty
Fuck the fortress
Riddle me with glee, hoist the end all teleprompter above my sleeping head
I'll be dead by morning anyway
Color my values with mundane humor in thirty minute tickets
To feel the magnetic seal picket censorship
I want commercials twenty four-seven
I wanna shop from my bed and set an
Example for all my overworked, underpaid brethren
I bond with a six string(?) correspondence
And lurking circuitry circus
With allegiance pledged beyond the glass surface
Adamant students within the fine school of possessed graduate catalysts
Channel zero addict, immaculate
It goes- big screen, little screen, any screen'll do
Just let me hold the controller and I won't have to murder you

Plug it in, turn it on, let my little eyes glaze
Twenty screens lined up along the borders of the maze
I wanna see the five day forecast, fourteen days in advance
So I can get my two weeks notice every time the sun dance

Plug it in, turn it on, silent flicks better than nothing
Let a once divine soul feel the functions of the hypnotist
The viciousness, ridiculous, peaking a dummy's interest
Touch the power button meet your maker, ain't that something?

Plug it in, turn it on, say goodbye to Sunday afternoon
Fix the antenna, sit back and let disaster bloom
It's a beautiful sight, with a most ugly intention
But I taste it everyday and bathe inside the consequences

Plug it in, turn it on, never once have you talked back to me
Your majesty, I love you, I despise you
My everyday is sitcom, soaps, news, bad dramatization
Come along with me, my friend for the most glorious sensation[Hook: scratched sample]
Bass for your trunk

[MURS]
She keeps her biz booming down front street
Open with the funk so that no one wants beef
She the type who like to lay it all on the line
She say what's on her mind, that way it ain't a crime
The crime is that you show no shame
Atd you make those claims like you play no games
When in reality, you the biggest player of them all
The princess that wore the most layers to the ball
Trying to cover up when you laying in your drawers
You front like you a freak and everything you say is raw
But deep down, you really scared he's gonna leave ya
Your closet got more skeletons than the Dia De los Muertos
You worse than my perros
My dogs, that only fuck with broads from the ghetto
You date losers cause it make you feel superior
Try to tell me lies to justify but all I'm hearin' is the...

[Hook]

[Slug]
She seem like the type with no taste for shame
It walks like a snake then they can't complain
No, people love you and cling to them raw fumes
Keep it up so we don't see through your costume
She been a little queen since 15
In and out of different scenes, never kept her image clean
So critical, over-analytical
Fast forward, of course, old and miserable
Long trail of bread crumbs and head games
Bed bums, the best ones get pet names
First glance, you can see the dirt
Closet door wide open, no need to search
No, the truth is just an excuse
That you use to polish up a pair of selfish shoes
Take it how you want, but face up the front
Cause them skeletons dance to the bass...

[Hook]
