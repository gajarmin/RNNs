Great balls of fire
Guess who just crawled out the muck or mire
That could make you trust a motherfuckin liar
A real shuck n' jiver
Vaughn never been a duck n' diver
He spit on the mic, yuck, saliva
Hold it like a drunk driver hold a CB on a sharp turn
Still clutchin' his chest from the heartburn
What's your handle? I need a Zantac, ock
And thanks before I blank into anyphylactic shock
Rock the disco
Chocolate on a crisco ho
Cock diesel
And still tell a joke like Joe Piscopo
Tell em the basics
Basically, break the Matrix
And just for kicks, make em gel like Asics
That's why they actin standoffish
Eat the beat by hand like canned raw crawfish
Can you please pass the cocktail sauce?
You might as well know, hell is hot as hell boss
Tell my horse
He said broads call me Vaughny
I make sure I throws em back if they's too scrawny
Or boney, phony MCs use a stand-in
Leave him hangin like if I ain't know where his hands been
Hussy, how bout we bloody up your just for me
Bust a knee
Then go finish study, a plush degree
True victory, a new sick story
I never met a chick that was too thick for me
Holy Moses, my old earth know me closest
On how I played the back and stayed bent like scoliosis
It's no puzzle
You can ask Doc Zizmor
The slow guzzle got your nizzle crooked like Biz's jaw
Drink like a fishy, she wish she was a Pisces
Live since back when 25 cents Icees
Used to turn your tongue the color red
Now they want to fill ya full of lead
What the fuck that young fella said?
What kid?
It's Vaughn the red blooded
Do yourself a favor or come on, get head butted
Yoke him if he run
I'll be there in a jiffy son
With the flame suppressor like off the 151
Quit your bitchin, or get *BLAUW* in your babble-box
Punishment for drysnitchin', so now eat this Travel Fox
You'll be aight once it pass through your yellow belly
Only thing he said was can you please pass the jelly
Homo say what? Like a promo play the cut
On the late night, before you touch the mic, get your weight right
A lot of crews like to act like a violent mob
They really need to just shut the fuck up like Silent Bob
Either that or get smoked like hickory
Should squash the beef and go wash their teeth quickly
Know the stee, write a rhyme like a mystery
And sign it on the bottom in calligraphy, "Your nigga, V"[Intro]
One two
It's Masta Ace, Cunninlynguists
We about to get into the seasons
The seasons of hip hop
How we gonna start it?

[Verse 1: Masta Ace]
As we spring back to the past, it was all happening fast
We glorified coke and smoking crack in a glass
When b-boys danced to the latest jam
You could say this man was the greatest fan
When shoelaces were fat, and all the rapper's faces were black
And light-brown, a box with the right sound was all you needed
When it blast, they must move
You just proved you're hard like L in Krush Groove
And songs started to drop, Ain't nobody start at the top
Before Preme (DJ Premier) learned the art of the chop
This is way before SP's and MPC's
And long before CD's and MP3's
The game started to bloom and blossom
And masters ready for the cermony, like a groom in costume
Growth from the rain of the previous years
I took notes from what I heard through these devious ears
Yeah

[Verse 2: Deacon the Villian]
As Summer's heatwaves ascended in it's splendid manner
Green was flooding our scene, although the skin was tanner
"Fuck The Police!!" jumpin over radio scanners
It was hot in the shade, wet paint all over the canvans
Fuck Vanilla Ice cones, we had T, Cube's Amerikka's Most
And wanted that Chronic on the Left-Coast
Talent pools were full and fresh for swimming
Backstrokin' through Dark Sides and Illmatic beginnings
Them lemonade stands would make you street platinum
It was 2 Live, Florida crews caught heat for rappin'
But free speech pollination kept bees colonizing in hives
And stung Delores Tucker right in her pride
The Tribes ocean splash was rising the tide
Strictly 4 My Niggas that were ready to die in the ride
I wish the summer's vibe could've lasted forever
To bad we had to have a change in that weather, that shit was beautiful

[Hook]
Seasons Change, mad things rearrange
Play me in the winter
Play me in the summer
Play in the autumn
Any order
Seasons Change, mad things rearrange
Trees bright and green turn yellow brown, autumn caught em
See all them leaves must fall down

Verse 3: [Kno]
As the East vs. West winds blew, causing two
Legends to Fall like maple leaves from escalated beef
Assumed that the worst was over
Til these cats started wearing shiny costumes like the 31st of October
The weather's colder, but the word jacket/jack it
Is what they did to people's styles
Not what they covered they backs with
Tactics of the skill impaired
No Limit to what they'll do when the green is scarce
Some be Thanksgiving for who they know
While others get jerked for loot
Cause getting signed ain't a turkey shoot
No respect for the pilgrims who paved the way so you could rock that
Just pop crap and Plymouth Rock-Rap
Beyond gimmicks and fake plastic tits
Outkast and Raekwon dropped fall classic discs
Born to Roll, so I'm taking you back to school days of autumn
Before the bottom dropped out in 2K

[Verse 4: SOS]
By the dawn of the new millennium we saw bright chains
Winter brought along platinum causing the ice age
No more Gold, no more YO! MTV RAPS
Now we got R&B cats stealing classic rap tracks
In winter it's snowed in like the temperature's below ten
Citizens open up shows for more snowmen
Scrawny boys rock bubblegooses to pose like grown men
And you can catch freezer burn from women when they show skin
Jolly, fat, white men get paid when rap hits the shelves
And artists themselves get treated like Elves
Matter of fact, Santa's gotten so greedy when a rapper sells
You even need clearance to sample Jingle Bells
What the hell! You need cells and 2 ways for chicks to bone ya?
And so much ice on ya body that you can get pneumonia
Even at the beaches of Daytona it's gotten colder
But it's about time for the cycle to start over (echo)

How we gon' start it?I'm seconds from meeting what the Mossberg had to offer
And feed my thoughts to Christ to the altar
I wake up on a red floor
Axe in a dead whore
My dick chewed up, why I let this bitch give me head for?
Pigs tryin' ta kick down the door, I'm out for me
Opened the sliding glass door and hopped off the balcony
Fell 30 flights to cars on 10th Av
Landed on a FedEx-disguised meth lab
And after it blew up
I woke up and threw up
Stuck my hand in my pants, my shit ain't chewed up
Wiped the puke from my face
Then leave this place
With a 4-5 in the waist
At an elitist pace
No breeding space
I step out and show face
Within 3 minutes I'm approached for H
Then a shotgun to neck, now lose the weapon
And my skull fragments painted the sky for seconds

[Hook]
Back to my brain like my brain is a home
While I roll with the fame I still aim at the throne
All my peers all sleep and I'm the only one not weak
Or am I unconscious dreaming I'm making a speech
Is this reality or my memory getting mileage
Am I staring at the sun or blood vessels in my eyelids
Do I make music or is music making me
Is this really all death or just my awakening

I pick my head up, with a face full of drool
Look around the classroom, now I'm some geek in high school
Get fucked with in the hallway and can't do shit
But write names on bullets and fill a few clips
No need for rags and vodka, got a locker
With enough fire-power to war with helicopters
First clique to pass, I'm clicking to release
Each adolescent fist holding 4 police killers
And I ain't paying for the clips I'm spendin'
When I shoot up the crowd like a heroin convention
Feds storm the building for the sick boy with balls
Made of steel, put shit through toilet stalls
See my teachers dead through holes in the door
And alerted the cops outside, holdin' the floor
I exit the bathroom, enter a lead parade
Getting shot the fuck up but smoke some pigs on the way

[Hook]

I open up my eyes to get cracked in the face
Six times, while I'm asked for combos to a safe
My wife on the couch, dying, raped, in shock
While the gunmen argue on where to take the yacht
Assuming I'm rich
Playboy bitch
My own boat
And if I don't start speaking I'mma lose my throat
They start chumming the water with my dead ho and laugh
Force me to see great whites snapped on the lower half
Locked off my arm, do it in, no guns to shoot
Think of 3 past deaths and find an escape route
All I have to do is wake up, lift the mast
And get shot off the boat and my back to get whipped in half
I wake up screamin'
With a shotgun in church, feenin'
To kill myself, but I don't know if I'm still dreamin'
50-50 chance I'mma die and go straight up
Or straight to hell, either fuckin' way I'mma wake up!*Ooooh, Oooooh*
(yeah, alright)
*You know I hate to see you leave*
(hate to see you leave yeah)
*but I love to watch you go*
(love to watch you go yeahh baby)
*you know I hate to see you leave*
(hate to see you leave)
*girl I'd love it if you dont*
(stay with me, yeah.. yeah)


[Verse 1: STS]
Ok
Break up, break up tempo
Someone adjust my levels
This don't sound like heaven
You must be cool with the devil
I got this chick from Vegas, bitch
Runnin around with them rebels
Swears she really gets me
But the proof is in the shovel
Shorty's smooth as Ketel One
Hard as heavy metal
The way she ride my dick
You'd think my shit came with some pedals Uh uh
She tells me ain't no one better uh
STS, she only knows me by them letters uh
Thats rock in roll shit
I must think I'm Eddie Vedder
I know she fuck with other niggers
I don't sweat her
She said she'd only fuck with me if I would let her
I ain't no hater honey go 'head get yo cheddar uh uh
That type of shit just gets her wetter uh uh
She just hope I don't forget her uh uh
I told that bitch "bitch, I would never" uh
Man I ain't seen that bitch in for forevers uh uh

[Hook]

I never thought we'd meet again cuz I'm a cold nigga
A couple years later here we sippin cold liquers
Surrounded by the chronic smoke a couple gold diggers?
We had a show in cali just me and my gold niggas
I seen you with your homies
Couple other hoes wit cha
They dont even look the type that even roll with ya
I see you took your weave out
Ya got ya soul sista
Now the carpet matchs the drapes
Shorty, I'm just fuckin wit ya

Whats up with me and you tonight
Oh, is you walkin in and out my life?
You know I hate to watch you go
But if you do, promise to walk slow
She said that we should talk more
I think that we should talk less (yes)
Tonight we should just make love
(You know I hate to see you leave)
And tomorrow just have goodbye sex
(Hate to see you leave)
(I hate to see you leave baby, no)
*I love to watch you go*
See here we go again
(I love to watch you go, where you going?)
You know out of all the places in the world
*you know I hate to see you leave*
(I hate to see you leave)
Come back, you ending up with me tonight
*girl I'd love it if you dont*
(You ain't going nowhere)
(I know it. HA)

I got things to do
You got things to do
I got places to go
You got, you know

I just want to take this time out
See if we can just get together, you know
I dont know whats going to happen tomorrow
I dont know whats going to happen in a week

All I know is tonight girl
It should be you and me
It should be you and me X3

(no where, no where)
*I hate to see you leave*
(I hate to see you leave, where you going)
*But I love to watch you go*
(I love to watch you go cuz im going to bring you right back to me)
*I hate to see you leave*
(I hate to see you leave darlin)
*Girl I'd love it if you don't*
(Love it if you dont, come back to me baby, yeah, oh)[Verse One]
[Copywrite]
RJD2 drop that shit so I can drop my thoughts
Driftin' away and depress all within listening range
Nah, but for real I got so much shit on my mind
From fake motherfuckers to my future I'm trying to get in line
And doing Hip Hop in this life and time
Ain't all nice and fine
At times I feel like my whole life's a rhyme
Full of punchlines and jokes
Fuck-ups and punch-ins
It's like I just can't get shit right
The first time or somethin'
When no one knows your name
Your vinyl's still in stores
But you get a little light
Through arguing over who feels it more
We got sixteen-year-old net-heads buying garbage
Wanting to keep you for their personal private artist
We don't do shit for the clubs -
Is for us 45's go, RJ's the archaeologist diggin' 'em up
And I'm the saint sent
To vinyl when it gets set to bash
In this for life, until my final mic check is cashed

[Verse Two]
Yo
I can't fully become my mother's guiding light
Till my dad returns to tell me what the other side is like
I keep the things you taught trapped in mind
I know you cared, even though you weren't here half the time
But who am I to blame, I'd probably do the same in your shoes
I never held that against you, complained or assumed
To never went through what I'm living
Hell, who am I kidding?
Depression is practically part of family tradition
So I keep the time we shared close
It sucks to lose
It also sucks we had to share the month of june
I woulda shared eternal time before I left
Each month I celebrate my birth
And reminded it of your death[Aceyalone]
Aiyyo the police short Cornbread in the street
And they just killed Cochise over a beat

Ah man, I'm just a brother whose intentions are good
Oh lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
I gotta 10 fifty-fo' under the hood
Several stages of lifespan, damned if I would
Be a dope when it's not a laughin matter
Modern contemporary man still hunt and gather data
They want glamour, the priceless prize
Give 'em a torch and they put the fire to your eyes
Give 'em a inch they take a yard and they pull your card
Throw a wrench so far in yours it'll leave a scar
Raise the bar, I pass it with the right scholastics
They made it plastic, that's why they couldn't grasp it
I always knew that you would fail me
Once shame on me twice you shouldn't have to tell me
And I'll be damned if I'll let you get away with that
I just ain't playin that, that's that bullshit!

Jardine and the kids tryin to make ends me
Half dead and do dirty as some God damn thiefs

Yo - hold your head up, you only got your life left
Make the right step and don't sing the wrong song
Fight somebody your own damn size
You dead wrong, thinkin you won't meet yo' demise
This baby here, gon' grow up to be a king
I don't know how you seein things, but that's a fact
It'll be over my dead body
If I let you put a mother{fuckin} monkey on his back
Shit ain't changed, it's just the choices
The voices in your head sayin do what you don't gotta do
They scared of themselves which means that they scared of me
And them the same, punk-ass fools that shot at you
The lord giveth and he taketh away
God bless that I can live to see another day
And if I had it my way I'd hang you all by the neck
Have some respect, I'll serve and protect

Aiyyo the police short Cornbread in the street
And they just killed Cochise over a beat

And if my teachers could see you now
They'll take your head, cause you probably wouldn't even bow
You ain't humble, you mumble jumble
Your tower of so-called power'll crumble
You killed my uncle, put a dagger through my brother's heart
I need another start, cause if I knew then
What I know now, it'll be wild
Booyaka! Booyaka! I'll put you in the ground
A peaceful man ain't got no place here
I guess you wanna see 'em all die with the lambs
I face fear everyday 'til the space is clear
Then I fight 'em like a man cause it's what I am
Somebody told me the road to freedom is lonely
But I swear I ain't goin on my own
I'm takin my sisters, my families, my homies
Now I'm about to take this mother(fucker) home

Aiyyo the police short Cornbread in the street
And they just killed Cochise over a beat
Jardine and the kids tryin to make ends me
Half dead and do dirty as some God damn thiefsOne last vein to poke made it too dark to see this
Scenery slips then line up to go in the ground and leave us
So repeat this till I'm sick and I won't feed this
To my little girl who kept me in this world to beat this
As a little kid taught to follow Jesus
Get to the front of the line I'm bein' lead by elitists
So when I speak words that I don't mean
It's like I'm only in a cloud to wonder what serene is
Unable to wake and delete the reasons
Or be the same bed I made up to sleep with demons
Whether sick sane of a pattern repeated
If I spit pain I knew how to relieve it
If at sixteen I had started to treat it
Till my shit changed whether or not I would need it
To trace back to the face before the fetus
If the departure was wrong from the gate then she is

Trigger finger itch
The son of a snitch
I'm the rat's favorite son
Last to pal and cut
Slit to bleed the rust
By the last heart I've won
We roll under covers waiting
I've tied off a limb debating
If all of the names forsaken
Spell out what I'm takin'
Watching the skin pop
I would do anything to
Tell you what I've been late to
Fix up my head and escape to
Where I can rest my eyes

The sun says wake up with a beam in my eyes
Clutchin' the bed like she's still by my side part of me died
Eat what I'm prescribed still just to be ostracized
'Cuz she don't really know if she wants to ride or drive
While no nooses long enough to hang my excuses
Whether I'm dead, gun to my head, or reclusive
The end is close almost no need for money
Yet when I wished for death nobody took my life from me
If I cannot see what's right in front of me
And the lights on there still wouldn't be enough to leave
I fixed me when I broke the aggression
But I'm still attracted to my beautiful depression
If I felt emotions I learned to suppress 'em
Till I'm ready to sleep I'll have found a place to rest then
No thanks to angst I learned my lesson
And can erase the face that can't answer the questions

Trigger finger itch the son of a snitch
I'm the rat's favorite son
And by the time I'm back
That heart that beats so black
Let it shine like his gun
We roll under covers waiting
I've tied off a limb debating
If all of the names forsaken
Spell out what I'm taking
Watching the skin pop[Verse One: Copywrite]
Copywrite the white James Brown, write flames down
High rate on these flight weight clowns with light weight sounds
You lie face down while I take crowns and violate towns
And fuck who opened up, it's my place now
But you barking loudly
For a mutt that's part Chihuahua
Still shine when I'm high, partly sunny, partly cloudy
You talking mouthy?
And I'mma duct tape you fuck faces
Ain't no administrating how you bit, fuck braces
Gauges end up blazing out you cliques, duck quickly
I'm like a broken condom, none of y'all can fuck with me
I hope [?] revolving gat aimed at your frame and the palms will clap
The High Exaulted's back
Fresh off tour
Yeah, left a mess on whores
Promoters that owe us doe sweat bullets through Teflon pours
And I match 'em two for every one they sweat out
Spread the led out with highbeams
I'm like Visine I get the red out

[Yak Ballz]
We at the club and I'm out of my forehead
Eyes so bloodshed, everything's painted all red
And we all wet, shit my crew all bent
Enough to send shots straight through the doors of a Benz limo
So obliterated, they ID 'em by the passenger's dental
Pissy drunk and I'm tippin' like domino's
We live it up plush [?] we get high and I love it when I'm in the cut
Sipping my cup in fly denim
Haters know we got fly with 'em, bitches wanna rock with 'em
After the bar, even with so-called rap stars
Smoking too many blunts, they making me laugh hard
We rap gods, Weathermen
It's time to blast off

[Tame One]
Tame been All City since Tootie had small titties
Come to the mall's with me
I be spending all fifty's
High again
With enough smoke to choke a fireman
Last seen with 76 phillies like Iverson
High and bent in my environment
Where I invent lyrical violence
That'll separate the mice from the men
I Timberland swamp stomp competition that's listening
Twice as interesting cause I'm different
The difference in being the champ or going the distance
Same one, the Cheech wizard
Tragic magic, mental dyslexic, be rapping backwards when I practice
Mentally hit, bent, like I'm taking a shit
Drink a whole Hennessy fifth and won't trip
See me in the corner rolling chocolate chips in little Bricks
That's the Izabella, twenty twen' twen' twen', like Chris Tucker
This mahfucker
Tame is that nigga

[Cage]
You chilling at a killer's dinner party
Evening will pull us, put a blade in you it's just retrieving the bullets
Death's still touring, Starks thinking of waring
You're weaker each release like Lucas wrote they shit for 'em
I'm just trying to get my money to build
But I can't feel with my hands so Cage is coming to kill
And fix these numbers
And spend some of this HBO check on embalming like Six Feet Under
Left side of the stadium get torn the fuck down
Give these indie rap squaters more reason to suck now
Shit, piss and corruption so fuck the love
While I roll with my cult following and drink some blood

[Breezy Brewin]
Breezily I approach, I spy on enemies
Heatedly like I'm coached by Bobby Knight, y'all Brian Denney's
I be tight seeing these bad actors
See your ass crack, you're drunk at some gay bar on fag daiquiris
Life's trife, Al-Queda wide eyed
I hear "Death to the infidels"
I fear for my wife's life
Then my thoughts switched
Had some talks with my Weathermen brethren
Now I pimped that star bitch
Perform, get your doe, you show your ass, nice good tits
[?] down for the pound, cover heist footprints
We weather whatever men
Y'all whether or not to continue living
Given you know you never have sex...with women
The crew's legit, could never be sloppy
I see Copy, Copy, Copy, leaving brothers on some Puba shit
Just avoid Cage
Yak, Tame, Breezly Brewin, swing harder than Sammy Sosa during 'roid rageLOVE

I see your face shrouded in a laugh
Cloaked in love that I had
But didn't get back
Romanticizing my past
Because things look better through this view
8mm me, 8mm you
So playful, but was it really like this?
I fight this urge to be a lifeless blur
Living with what I have now - that's emptiness
You on the magazine cover but I'm not envious
Because I inspired you to follow your dreams
Then you realized your dreams didn't have any room for me
So I'm doomed to sleep alone on the bed we bought together
But at least I'll remember us forever, in my

8mm dreams

8mm dreams

TIME

Starting over, I'm back like i never been
Hate everything i made, so how could i be arrogant?
I'm getting older, trying to set shit straight
Spitting harder because i got more candles on the cake
Looking back, seems further than it might be
It's unlikely but it feels like life be the icing
That was too sweet didn't get eaten
Bottom of the trash - it gave cockroaches something to believe in
But I'd never kill time, I've made love to it gently
So imagine my surprise when i found that it left me
Gone forever, with no note
Just some footage to watch while i sit here and soak in these

8mm dreams
8mm
8mm dreams

LIFE

And I'm from the acting capital where they acting for capital
So don't act like you ain't acting because we're all actors after all
We just more honest about it so the camera screams louder
And as the years pass and they seeming like hours
Pixels engrave our loved ones make us prouder
Because soon all our graves will be covered in flowers
And like cows that graze lazily before being devoured
We stay slaves rather than paying the price for power
Ideas over ideals, art feeds us, but it got us owing them bills
Our leaders speak words coated in thrills, cheap ones
Longing for conformist love, cheap puns, and

8mm dreams

FATE

I was caught in the traps set for me
Poor souls writing scrolls that say rest in peace
Dead to me, dead to them
End goal is detrimental, let go of the echoes
Let them envelope my other self's every step
While the real me is swimming in this emptiness
And if i ever felt worthy of praise it was a mistake
I lay awake in the bed i made, so stay fake
Stay carbon copy charred and ugly
Par the course failed the course? call it costly
Love and robbery, take what i want, I'm stoic
Stab a coward in the back
To be heroic in my

8mm dreams[Vast Aire]
One three five
I'm screaming in your face but you dont hear me tho
Gun shed, Rainbow, Harlem Nights
Where's my niggas at?
Smack you in your face, you crazy?

Y'all need to leave that crack alone
Leave that crack alone
Leave that crack alone
Leave that crack alone

I can't hear you

[Verse 1]
Y'all niggas is bitch like
Can't talk your way out can't even fist fight
I think you pressed your luck
You better watch yourself the lottery's up
Two more cheers then we tip the cup
We ending carrers tonight, thats whats up
Whats up Eso, yea I called you out
Its only matters of time before the bitch ooze out
And it's only matters of time till your teeth fall out
When you ran back home you lost your clout, Gimme that
You shoulda never started shit
Now your in the corner with a bandage kit
Plus I know your jealous of Lif
Thats why he bounced on y'all, y'all 'ain't doing it
He got with some real cats, thats true to this
Now your all black-listed, your ruined it

Chorus x2
I'm a knock y'all down a level
Sort of like when Micheal cast down the devil
Sort of like when the earth gets reduced to a pebble
Sort of like when the government defeats the rebel

[Verse 2]
I was there when you begged El to sign you
He knew Ox was gonna blow so he didn't sign you
Wooo, I guess the secrets out
Mommy they won't play with us, then go in the house
Play time's over, close your mouth
Do all your chores and then you go out
You gotta make dope music before you come out
The closet, and I think its a walk-in
With 7L behind you and he 'ain't even talking
I heard your beats on ten, they 'ain't even thumping
Cry now cause your castles crumbling
And if you heard Dirty Mag, you know they fronting
You think we care what you did eight years ago
Oh you were on tour with them and so and so
Weathermen, we running this shit
Likliest one in the chamber and you running your shit
What the fuck

Chorus x3

*RJD2 scratches to finish the track*A beautiful mind, turned water into wine
But that’s not all
Broke the water, shined through
Shaped the earth, created the colder life
Radiated with energy, the great boat of life
The spark
Sparkling through the dark night
Then walked
And took forever without a thing in sight
Didn't hear a sound till the first trickle(?) fell
Depths of the ocean swelled, washed up a miracle
A beautiful yours, a beautiful mines

By the grace of fire, out sprouts the land
Fed the desire, footprints in the sand
Top of the mountain peak, man speaks to himself
Closer to the mother star
What he felt can’t be described
It’s alive
Rise with the tide
Communicate with all sides, nothing wants to die
Buildin’ this, build a bridge
Build a tower
Construct a dam, dig a hole
Build a flower
Ultraviolet rays magnified the essence
All praise to the presence, one pure thought
Taught in the lessons
This spread with the first migration of the heads
And the first ones to flock

A beautiful yours, a beautiful mine
Once so enlightened; once so divine
The planet’s hour line, all void of time
A beautiful mind

They opened up the brain and opened up the heart
What is man made of?
Love from the dark
The will to invent the wheel
Work the field, the shield, the intent to kill, the uphill
Battle of existence, matter of persistence
Matter of distance to search for the mystics
Finder of lost souls, teacher of apostles, the mind’s so colossal
A beautiful mind

A beautiful mind, a beautiful idea
One that was right here, blind to the naked eye, tied to a fear
Once it was nothing and now it is here
A beautiful mind

Not accidental, coincidental, experimental
A beautiful mental, a touch so gentle
A life so simple to spin on the axis to access the temple
A beautiful mine, a beautiful yours
A beautiful mind

A beautiful mind, put fruit on the vine
At the same time he made love a crime
Mellowed out the screams of all mankind
Walked along side of you when you was left behind
Purified the waters, carved the canyons
Fed the families when it was starved and famined
Drew the blueprints so everyone had a chance
Organized the people and made man advance
A beautiful yours, a beautiful mine

Something outtaa nothing
Oh, what a far cry
More than a hard tribe
Pointed out the star guide
Made love, made hate
Saved sake
Nothing left to create but fate
Constructed structures, engineered labyrinths
Detailed a portrait
Healed nations
Took blame when no one else was happening
Evolved the species, and had patience
Wrote the scroll in thousands of languages
Came with us to fight against a giant ??
Created chaos, prevented destruction
Made law and order and then corruption
Laid the foundation for all things to stand on
Then cleared the ground for the mother ship to land on

Sailed across the seas, followed the breeze
Cured disease
Made poison
Settled the fear, took them on the righteous path
Gave them the math, and still had the time to laugh

What a beautiful mind to haveHook:

Yeah! Woo-coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh
Yeah! Ace One!
Yeah, and you know what I told you
I don't do this for myself
I do this strictly one hundred percent.. for you
{*scratched in background: "This one, for you and you and you"*}

[Hook]
Yeah, I do it all for you, I do it all for you
I do it all for you, I do it all for you

They put me on the wrong world, yes they did
Star on my forehead bless this kid
They threw me in headfirst, blind in the dark
In the alligator pit with the rest of the sharks
All I could think about was how they set me apart
I never knew a killer whale who had so much bark
The heart of a lion, I'm sharp as a dart
And it took me a long while to master the art
{*scratched: "This one, for you and you and you"*}
You know why?

[Hook]

[Aceyalone]
I'm Aceyalone, how can I be of service?
What else do you need besides superb wordage?
Man I stay heated like a burner from the furnace
My shoes always brown, same color as my shirt is
I write authentic, always all in it
Outside the law, raw, never fall timid
Always ahead of myself, pushing past the limit
We taught the world to freestyle now it's a epidemic

{*scratched: "This one, for you and you and you"*}
Yeahhhh! Woo-coo-coo-coo-coo!

[Hook]

[Aceyalone]
I walked the long mile just because I had to
I'll be glad to add to the pile if I have to
Ain't a situation on earth that I can't adapt to
I do what I got to, and a little of that too
I am what I am but that ain't all I can be
Spend a lifetime trying to big up the family
I leave 'em with they eyes open wider than Bambi
They don't understand me, that's why they abandon me

{*scratched: "This one, for you and you and you"*}
Yeah! Yes man!

[Hook]

[Aceyalone]
I'm always on next and ready to bust it up
Work hard, play hard, never a customer
Skills stay hardy at the party for sustenance
Man I'm on the grind, I'm a non-stop hustler
I'll fight the fight that nobody will fight though
Spite those fools that be trying to bite dope
I'm like no other MC on the mi-cro
I might go psycho, keeping it tight though

{*scratched: "This one, for you and you and you"*}
One two! Yeah yeah, yeah yeah!

[Hook]

[Aceyalone]
No guts, no glory, it's the same ol' story for
I'm out with my nightstick, cruising the corridor
They always wanna ask why you swinging that sword of yours
Because I'm a warrior, killing them more and more
Who you gonna call when there's so many to choose from
You win some, lose some, now who wanna do some'
A new somebody who be trying to prove some'
Now I gotta move some, and give you a new sum

{*scratched: "This one, for you and you and you"*}
Woo-coo-coo-coo! Yeah-heah!

[Hook]

[Aceyalone]
Yeah I'll put a fire to the house that Jack built
I rose from the grave for the people that crack killed
My name on my buckle when I'm wearing my black belt
I gave you half the world now tell me how that felt
Cause anywhere you go, I'll be right behind you
And if you don't know, then I gotta remind you
Hold on to your parachute and jump when it's time to
Cause I was designed to have the people to rhyme to

{*scratched: "This one, for you and you and you"*}
No shit! Yeah-h-h, didn't you know?

[Hook]I'm seconds from meeting what the Mossberg had to offer
And feed my thoughts to Christ to the altar
I wake up on a red floor
Axe in a dead whore
My dick chewed up, why I let this bitch give me head for?
Pigs tryin' ta kick down the door, I'm out for me
Opened the sliding glass door and hopped off the balcony
Fell 30 flights to cars on 10th Av
Landed on a FedEx-disguised meth lab
And after it blew up
I woke up and threw up
Stuck my hand in my pants, my shit ain't chewed up
Wiped the puke from my face
Then leave this place
With a 4-5 in the waist
At an elitist pace
No breeding space
I step out and show face
Within 3 minutes I'm approached for H
Then a shotgun to neck, now lose the weapon
And my skull fragments painted the sky for seconds

[Hook]
Back to my brain like my brain is a home
While I roll with the fame I still aim at the throne
All my peers all sleep and I'm the only one not weak
Or am I unconscious dreaming I'm making a speech
Is this reality or my memory getting mileage
Am I staring at the sun or blood vessels in my eyelids
Do I make music or is music making me
Is this really all death or just my awakening

I pick my head up, with a face full of drool
Look around the classroom, now I'm some geek in high school
Get fucked with in the hallway and can't do shit
But write names on bullets and fill a few clips
No need for rags and vodka, got a locker
With enough fire-power to war with helicopters
First clique to pass, I'm clicking to release
Each adolescent fist holding 4 police killers
And I ain't paying for the clips I'm spendin'
When I shoot up the crowd like a heroin convention
Feds storm the building for the sick boy with balls
Made of steel, put shit through toilet stalls
See my teachers dead through holes in the door
And alerted the cops outside, holdin' the floor
I exit the bathroom, enter a lead parade
Getting shot the fuck up but smoke some pigs on the way

[Hook]

I open up my eyes to get cracked in the face
Six times, while I'm asked for combos to a safe
My wife on the couch, dying, raped, in shock
While the gunmen argue on where to take the yacht
Assuming I'm rich
Playboy bitch
My own boat
And if I don't start speaking I'mma lose my throat
They start chumming the water with my dead ho and laugh
Force me to see great whites snapped on the lower half
Locked off my arm, do it in, no guns to shoot
Think of 3 past deaths and find an escape route
All I have to do is wake up, lift the mast
And get shot off the boat and my back to get whipped in half
I wake up screamin'
With a shotgun in church, feenin'
To kill myself, but I don't know if I'm still dreamin'
50-50 chance I'mma die and go straight up
Or straight to hell, either fuckin' way I'mma wake up!This is a RJ-D2, Justus League production

Sick fluin' you, breakin' niggas
Electric Boogalo, wire me, fire me, admire me
They hire me to do jobs, professional run through squads
I split em' come, come, drop the sewer
Should I hit em' up on some 'Pac Shakur shit?
On top of the globe, givin' the world violence, wants control
This the girl, she should've been on the album
Fuck it, I'm invincible, keepin' my bitches bendable
Like contortionist, wild life, the source of this
No wife, I won't forfeit this, revenge on some pork and shit
Oink muh'fucker, ever line on point muh' fucker
Eat your lame lines, say somethin', give me dinner
We move at the same time like we synchronized swimmers
Back strokin' and shit, got niggas showboatin' this bitch
Twelve oceans with this, stay afloat with my click

I'm from a place where them boys been at
Where the Eastside and Southside niggas went at
With the low lifes and heroin addicts; On my block
You should at least look hard, and I don't mean squint at
Or you might get tossed around; The spring sting
Of the League, and I'mma show you how a boss get down
So homeboy remind yourself, rewind yourself
Or you could find yourself in the lost & found
Tay' aimin' where it hurts, and you can feel the pain
And anguish in the verse; and I pray this game don't
Change me for the worse, Cause it's all permanent
RJ on the beat, so ya'll call it alternative
I don't give a fuck, just as long as ya'll burnin' it
Nigga, I got next, motherfuck whoever turn it is
And when I'm on stage, live is how I hit em up
J. League's the second comin'/cummin' ya'll still tryna get it up

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Who's the best that did it, the best to live it
Every line I hand paint a picture so vivid
It's the Mr. Crazy, nicest, maybe
We tryna get a leg up and then ash a lady
Eighty's baby, maybe you could get a chance
Take a minute to break, naw cuz he's back on
Nametag, swing, with my name in them
Other niggas counterfit, ain't the same as him
Shame on them, I'm a bring the pain to them
I'm a make em never imitate the champion
They can't beat him, of course not, my thoughts rock
While I roll with the best crew, you group rocks
At the bottom of the bottom, I'm on top of the top
Black, green, I'm on every block
I done had it up to here, and this shit gon' stop
No wack nigga's gonna make a move on my spot

[Hook]I dont believe youre ready for this
Are you ready for this?
We'd like to capture your minds right now
Take you a little bit higher
With a little black rock

Rock it, rock
Rock it, rock
Rock is so
Yo

Rock is so neo for my people. This cerebral law, bleed and fought
Brought on by my alter ego, I halt like the desert eagle
We talk the crust feeble minded motherfuckers
Uncover they gliss cause it's not on your wrist
Givin' you somethin' to twist up
Lift up and breath in, I let it resonate
Elevate you like smoke that broke through heaven's gate
Some estimate that I can take it wherever it leaves me
This ain't easy but I'm steady gettin' my elbows greasy
Puttin' my back in it
Accent it with facts in it. This a reality
Radically left wing and my next, breedin' with sex
Gs and inanimate objects, with prospects and movements
Supreme, you said yourself. Who else would I represent?
While time leavin' evidence, I'm conceivin' the head of it
Receivement try to see me at eye to eye level
With 6 shots pumpin' plots, fierce to pierce metal
Your armor no match for me. Understandably so

Yo
Who wanna test the levels of their versify?
Spinnin' the earth and search beneath it where the purpose lies
Ready to dance under the pale moonlight
You'll soon find what you're dealing with significantly certified
Who wanna test Mr. "Three-I-Versify"?
Your whole notions in this thing have been commercialized
Ready to dance under the pale moonlight
You'll soon find

I verbalize surface ties and merchandise theory
Clearly open their threshold to expose my exposé
Obey your thirst, a simple page of verse, refreshingly dope
Indelibly soaked up on rush confusion
My enterprise identifies the city skies and urban manifestos
Rose up through the chaos to shake plots and pose
Visions enclosed in a globe spinnin', I'm seein'
Be out in my satellite capturin' sight that your eyes couldn't fathom
Fillin' up the still cane and spreadin' over your terrain
Changin' complexions, intersection, that you holdin' down
It goes around like bad karma with mass trauma, the 1200
Yo, who want it? Cause I'm much obliged to give it
With centrifugal forces, sources beyond your physics
My mic chemistry, convincingly providin' what's efficiently fly
Straight to your chest, comin' off o' my mouth
You know your armor no match for me. Understandably so

Yo
Who wanna test the levels of their versify?
Spinnin' the earth and search beneath it where the purpose lies
Ready to dance under the pale moonlight

Aiyyo the police short Cornbread in the street
And they just killed Cochise over a beat

Ah man, I'm just a brother whose intentions are good
Oh lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
I gotta 10 fifty-fo' under the hood
Several stages of lifespan, damned if I would
Be a dope when it's not a laughin matter
Modern contemporary man still hunt and gather data
They want glamour, the priceless prize
Give 'em a torch and they put the fire to your eyes
Give 'em a inch they take a yard and they pull your card
Throw a wrench so far in yours it'll leave a scar
Raise the bar, I pass it with the right scholastics
They made it plastic, that's why they couldn't grasp it
I always knew that you would fail me
Once shame on me twice you shouldn't have to tell me
And I'll be damned if I'll let you get away with that
I just ain't playin that, that's that bullshit!

Jardine and the kids tryin to make ends me
Half dead and do dirty as some God damn thiefs

Yo - hold your head up, you only got your life left
Make the right step and don't sing the wrong song
Fight somebody your own damn size
You dead wrong, thinkin you won't meet yo' demise
This baby here, gon' grow up to be a king
I don't know how you seein things, but that's a fact
It'll be over my dead body
If I let you put a mother{fuckin} monkey on his back
Shit ain't changed, it's just the choices
The voices in your head sayin do what you don't gotta do
They scared of themselves which means that they scared of me
And them the same, punk-ass fools that shot at you
The lord giveth and he taketh away
God bless that I can live to see another day
And if I had it my way I'd hang you all by the neck
Have some respect, I'll serve and protect

Aiyyo the police short Cornbread in the street
And they just killed Cochise over a beat

And if my teachers could see you now
They'll take your head, cause you probably wouldn't even bow
You ain't humble, you mumble jumble
Your tower of so-called power'll crumble
You killed my uncle, put a dagger through my brother's heart
I need another start, cause if I knew then
What I know now, it'll be wild
Booyaka! Booyaka! I'll put you in the ground
A peaceful man ain't got no place here
I guess you wanna see 'em all die with the lambs
I face fear everyday 'til the space is clear
Then I fight 'em like a man cause it's what I am
Somebody told me the road to freedom is lonely
But I swear I ain't goin on my own
I'm takin my sisters, my families, my homies
Now I'm about to take this mother(fucker) home

Aiyyo the police short Cornbread in the street
And they just killed Cochise over a beat
Jardine and the kids tryin to make ends me
Half dead and do dirty as some God damn thiefsI'm a non-educated man staying faded when I can
Playing hooky slaying rookies staying crazy where I am
Though it may not seem that way checking back on my track won't blow you away
I lack certain things read up on my page
My laziness is crazy shit every day
They didn't know what to say or what to play to see me behave
Honestly their hate of my state caused me to lash out -

Get my parents to cash out

Making me a bad child
With no remedy for calamity
Needy, yelling feed me at 18
With no where to breathe easily
I guess it can be seen dropped on my head at age 3
No need to ask me, I'm dead when I read the answer key
Fans can see me dancing and prancing through life's mystery
Fighting history too easily
Letting kids become me and some be telling me to
STOP - which is probably for the best
I'm not grounded as solidly as any of the rest
They say it's all a test but I won't pass it
So I'll sit and zest while the green outlasts it
Heave it from my chest like a lyrical exorcist
Check my spirit crest and engage the SIKATRIKS
I'm sick-of-tricks, and this is your last kiss
From the spirit of death, know your excuse yet? Who said to write cheques if you're too dead to cash shit?

CHORUS

SET IT UP
TRY YOUR BEST
YOU'LL NEVER MAKE ME MAKE ME DILIGENT (X4)

KEEP IT UP AND
GRAB A FRIEND
JUST TRY TO MAKE ME DILIGENT (X4)

Intelligence is preference so I never make sense
On the fence between offense and defense
Can't defend against my pretense
So don't pretend like my will is weakened
My skill is freedom, and it has begun
To see some thing's that sing across my kingdom
It seems obscene that no one see's my fiendom
So now I write raps, record track, and release them
Scratch that, whack-ass, fake raps they feed you
No class and content makes their shit see through
Check the real facts then set back the channel
Or let the fat cats roll while you simply stand still
Oh now the pills will start to effect
And my consciousness reverts to defects
No longer dissect any of life's interests
And my weakness creeps out a death wish
Scream in need of material excess
Just please don't accept what you must reject
Anyways
I forgot to explain
The whole first verse
And what I was saying
Basically I spent my whole life playing
Dreaming incoherent I don't wanna be famous
But all these people try to tell me it's painless
That they all made it by trying out the same shit
Many years passed before it was clear
That everything I've done has been out of fear
What a strange world I now perceive
Craving fangs now draining trees
With no way to properly thank and please
With no police to protect and serve
I could corrupt herds with every word
But I must resist this tempting verse
Sikatriks lives for the earth
So I'll always give my fighting burst
Though by now I'm starting to strain
Drained my brain now I don't know my own name
But I'm on the third page
Carting up the bird cage
Heart can't keep up with these absurd ways
Dark in the park of suburban play
So few things that I haven't faced
No way that I'll ever be on top of the game
"I'm just too indifferent" that's what they all say
Referring to pass exams and monotone court dates
Never give back to the graves that relax

More than a game, please set the tax and
Admit the addicts into another pack (pact)
Some call it rehab some take to relax
No short to relapse go run some laps
Look at this big gap that we created
All these famous first class birthing babies

While I simply try just to hold the essence
No point in guessing based on your perspective
Just call me dumb, I'll straight reflect it
May have failed the class but pass all the life lessons(Hoch!) Schmeiss die Hände hoch, (Hoch!) schmeiss' die Hände hoch und bebt
Sonst haben wir ein Verständigungsproblem ahh
Kleine Fangfrage // wer ist der Rapper mit den Fanfaren?
Sickbwoi, der Frontmann deiner Parade (a-haaa!)
Schmeiss die Hände hoch, (Hoch!) schmeiss die Hände hoch und klatscht
Weil sonst die Verständigung nicht klappt ahhh

Wir tuckern mit Trompeten durch das Land
Unterm WSG-Logo steigt das Termometer an
Und trotz der steigenden Benzinkosten
Und der Tatsache dass wir bei unserer Reise nie ans Ziel kommen
Blasen wir den Marsch bei jedem anwesenden Gast
Komprimieren Tage zu ner Nacht, verblasen unsern Charme
Jetzt ist Showtime // die alten Platten haben Kratzspuren
WSG ist da, und schenkt der Masse eine Schatztruhe
Goldbarren und ein scheissender Esel
Und Shirts im goldenen Schnitt für alle weiblichen Wesen
Also cheese baby // unsere Nächte gehen lang
Die Gang ist in der Stadt und hat den Sender auf Empfang
Und das ganz ohne HD-Receiver nur mit 'nem
Channel den du präventiv abonnieren kannst von den Lebenskünstlern
Hau den Warnblinker rein
Denn wir erreichen die Schallgeschwindigkeit, wir sind high

WSG! der Brandfleck auf deiner Landkarte

Du spielst für 'n Appel und ein Ei
Wir beziehen Gage in iPhones von Apple
So weit vor den Rapper die Kacke rappen und meinen
Ein halbherziger Style kann die Liveshow ersetzen
Der Eindruck verlässt mich nicht, Rapper haben Tourettesyndrom
Nimm dir ein Beispiel - Essensproben
Wir zählen Scheine - Wettbüros
Auch wenn wir etwas Kleingedrucktes schreiben wird das groß wie im Capslookmodus
Wir kommen mit Kameraequipment
Und sie wackeln mit den Titten so wie Sambatänzerinnen
Das ist wirscheissengold - weils viele verbocken:
Klein und zusammen, wie Justin Bieber und Selena Gomez
Ah okay die Line ist nicht ganz aktuell
Ich muss schneller releasen, darauf wartet die Welt
Und wenns nicht klappt, dann eben neu von vorn
Karren an die Wand, scheiss drauf, Vollkasko
Folg RapGeniusDeutschland![Hook]
Keep tryna keep it real by keepin' it raw
While half of y'all still be keepin' it flaw
And all the real heads scream "FUCK HIP HOP!"
Until this mediocre bullshit stops
Drug fiends let me show you the route
Who's that motherfucker still keepin the dope in the house?
It's Mota mouth (who?), it's Mota mouth baby, it's Mota mouth

[Verse 1]
Whenever I write, I put myself out of place from other cats
So it don't sound like another brother's rap
I smother tracks with raw shit, niggas aren't able to bite
What I bring to the table is height
Then I easily superceed, niggas need what I got
Reason I'm hot, there's no other raw season of pot
While most motherfuckers follow the guidelines and hip hop 101
Jakki the Mota mouth decides to have fun
Not following rules, swallowing crews
Son I toss cats off the stage, often I slay their soft raps
To all you fake dictionary emcees, get off that
Half of y'all don't understand your own rhymes and soft batch(?)
They straight at open mics, we put them out on the street
Take away their dope beat, let 'em rhyme and they weak
And the mic can be a decieving device
Muffle your rhymes so they ain't clear and concise
Have niggas thinking you nice
With battle I'll crack all your gear and all your wack raps
You can't be saved by your babbling or your backpack
Doing it for the love is great but you fake
And putting your shit out is a mistake nobody wants to make

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Hate when I go to open mics and I see everybody clapping
For some clown they don't understand
Yet everybody acting like he dope because they believe he's hip-hop
Y'all convincing me that most of y'all are brainwashed
Dug(?) in old hip-hop history
Some cats are crap without their tracks cause they weak
I wish a nigga would say he listen to me for the beats
Some got the nerve to say they dope when they spit
When even they family got a tape and they won't open the shit
I got a big mouth and I ain't scared to use it
One person's keystyle(?) allows everyone to abuse it
So what the fuck is your definition of underground?
Depressing beats and bleak cats who love the sound
Well I ain't part of that, I'm tired of rapper's garbage
I'm the part of the underground who only feels the raw shit
And I can take a nigga out regardless
You can bring your hardest artists and I'll make 'em heartless
Some say they lyrically this, or lyrically that
Throwing lyrical in every rap and they lyrically wack
And many cats rhyme over tracks nobody fiends(?) for
Don't fuck around with me, if you can only fuck with keyboards
Just cause lazy niggas use recognisable material
Don't mean the dope samples are not original
Cause a producer with skill can lace tracks
Keyboard beats aren't that original, lets face facts
That shit was overused in the G-funk era
Don't give me that excuse, real emcees want better
You rhyme over enough shit, most get away with murder
Like kids who think they words rhyme cause they the suffix
Must bitch niggas be fragile with facts
You bragging 'bout who you battled, but who you battled was crap
What you angry for, and acting all tense
If you innocent be cool, only the guilty's catching offense

[Hook][Blueprint]
Yeah, what up
{*"The show is over"*}
Welcome to the final frontier
Soul Position
RJD2 on the beats plus myself, Blueprint, on the rhymes
{*"The show is over"*}
Live and direct

[Hook]
We're here {*"The show is over"*}
The Final Frontier
We're here {*"The show is over"*}
The Final Frontier

[Verse 1]
We breathe adrenaline, elevate organically
Life begins when the record spins and ends
When blended into the next with scratches
RJ constructs the canvas, I find a color that matches
Outline the rhyme and increase the content
Blueprint the piece that completes the concepts
Sequence the song steps to make it more complex
Soul Position in, sole possession of
Poll position, hold your breath and listen
While I resurrect these twenty-six letters
A lesson to beginners that tend to pale in comparisson
You're not ill, and if you are
My notepad's full of medicine
Plus my freestyle is Excedrin
Take two hours and call me back with a new style
And show me you're prepared for the final frontier

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
We breathe adrenaline, elevate organically
My pen like a turntable arm moves mechanically
Even when the groove shifts or skips dramatically
I accurately etch out my welded fine fantasy
Across a skyline covered with sound
I move into position like a cumulus cloud
Acid rain slang still a part of my emosis
My first demo, known to soak instrumentals
With brainstorms, capable to break in the calm
Created by strange tongues that praise the norm
But while they make a living giving false testimony
I often impress the ceremony with an exercise in exorcism
First I ride the rhythm, then I spit a venomous
Open mic sermon for the trife vermon
That had a hard time learnin'
How to properly prepare for the final frontier

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
We breathe adrenaline, elevate organically
Escaping out of milk crates with modern-day tragedies
Of lost verse, or crews you coulda looped first
But refuse to do the work when the whistle blew
So in a world dominated by the digital
The metrinome I listen to beats inside of my chest
It speeds up with a level of stress
It's built to last, but analog at best
Ingest another measurement of time served
My lifeline swerves kinda like a sine curve
Time blurs, during my breakneck ascend
To apex and then slows during my lows
Tone-deaf soundmen work my shows
The ass of my artform's always exposed
But I'm inspired by the front rows
They're the reason I prepared for the final frontier

[Hook]

{*"The show is over"*}
{*"The show is over"*}
{*"The show is over"*}[Intro: Blueprint]
Alright..
Yo! From the top!
Alright, okay
This is how we talk shit for 8 bars at the beginning
My team always winning
In the front row, grinning

[Verse 1: Blueprint]
We breathe adrenaline and exhale acid rain
Clinically(?) blast, shake off the pain
We roll
On you fast, take off your gold chain
We take, all the cash
We take, all the blame
We move, all the merch, CDs and shirts
For you
This is a game but for me this is work
I clock in
As soon as I step on the stage
I get paid when my record is played
The final frontier
Is when you master the stereo mix and twing
Snares and kicks like
Hands and fists
So when you know let the next man diss
But act like you don't care one bit (ha!)
See I'm around, give 'em a pound
And when his hand extend, you crack a smile
And punch him dead in his shit, see, ha
Soul Position in, sole possession of, pole position
Hold your breath and listen

[Hook: Blueprint]
We're here!
The final frontier!

[Verse 2: Vast Aire]
We're here now niggas..
Man
Damn these hoes
Smack a herb in his face and strike a b-boy pose
With a little alligator shirt
Don't make me..
Spit a verse you can ...
I been doing this since 10 years old
And ever since then they wouldn't leave me alone
You know Ox is so far you can't see the throne
You're lucky, if you peep my ankle
Your girl's hands, she's grabbing her ankles
Working my box spring and singing the Star Spangled
Bitch I ain't a patriot!
I'm more like a jet type
That'll hit you with a lead pipe
If the stats don't land right
Niggas try to kill me but I caught the kite
(That's why) They say they're here like Poltergeist
We're here niggas!

[Hook: Blueprint]
We're here! (Hey Ramble, get outta bed.. go to school..)
The final frontier! (Alright.. set it..)

[Verse 3: Aesop Rock]
We breathe adrenaline
Ramble crime Mega Man dust
Fuck computer
A 21-bazooka tooth salute
...
Hooker out the silo
...
Zig-zag brain companion
Tested positive for riot mouth
And clip 5 on the damage
With a curfew in the city (right!)
Liberty and justice plus titty
Sucking his tits without his dog for once
...

[Hook: Blueprint]
We're here! (..bitch.)
The final frontier!

[Verse 4: Murs]
First time I grabbed the pen
...
In stores now motherfucker, pick it up!
Braces still flipping up like Pac rolling his grave
Ever since he left we see those thugs can't behave
They
Use his name
Just to pull ...
If it wasn't for them bodyguards your ass would get maimed
I don't play this rap game
I play that bring the bullshit to wax and get SLAPPED game
So fuck a fat chain
I'm bumpin Bad Brains
Or, something that strange
While, playin' Max Payne
My hood played the crack game
I'm just a ghetto geek
Blessed with the gift of speech
So I quote Howard Zinn with a fist to your cheek
Hit rock bottom
French kiss the feet
And make victory my bitch by the end of the week and..

[Hook & outro: Blueprint]
We're here!
The final frontier!

We're here!

The final frontier
Stop talking shit
Learn how to rap first
The basics
Fundamentals
Def Jux
Printmatic
Rhymesayers
Weightless
Yo, Soul Position
Rjd2 on the tracks..
With his happy ass..
Peace to Ramble Krohn..

NB: Okay okay, I fully accept that these lyrics are far from perfect, but this track deserved a place on RG. I ESPECIALLY fucked up on Aesop's part, but I just couldn't keep up. Please edit/add as you see fit![Blueprint]
When I'm alone in my home, sometimes I cover my face
The walk around in circles at a slow pace
It's my attempt to erase
The feeling that I'm standing in place
At my 9-to-5 I teach computers to be clever
So they can replace you and do the job better
Never say never
Corporate America is out to save cheddar
Computer programming ain't about creation
It ain't about videogames or playstations
It ain't about making new jobs or innovation
It's about automation
And permanent vacations
Just the other day
My boss fires some cat that worked a thousand miles away
There wasn't nothing I could say
It was sad to see but I was glad it wasn't me
50 years of experience dependable
One merger, one meeting, expendable
I know it seems unbelievable
They used to kiss your ass, but now they don't need you

[Hook]
You ever thought about when you'll be out of here?
Nice job, nice car, still: out of here!
Middle management downsize, then out of here
Some shit that I ain't tryin to hear

Fuck the job... for real!

[Blueprint]
The best time in my career was at the start
I was working extra hours, pouring out my little heart
Now is hard for me to care
When I know I'm just a resource in somebody's chart
Staring at a corporate ladder I can't climb
Contributing to milestones and bullshit baselines
Ten hours a day wasting time
Trying to cut fat from my company's waistline
I want y'all to listen
They spend 50K just to say 50 Million
They hire me to cut labor in divisions
Less for you, less for your children

[Hook]
You ever thought about when you'll be out of here?
Nice job, nice car, still: out of here!
Middle management downsize, then out of here
Some shit that I ain't tryin to hear

Fuck the job... for real!

[Blueprint]
I've seen a lot of people come and go
Seen a lot of people sit around complaining about doe*
I've seen people get hired and then get a new car, bragging
And when it got tight, I've seen them brown bagging**
I've seen people hire for jobs I wouldn't touch
While being denied for jobs I really want
I've seen cats being promoted and demoted like chunks
Loose confidence, then resign the next month
I've seen people close to tears because they got bad reviews
Walking to your cube and start interrogating you
20 questions arguing and bitching
Mad about the money you make in your position
I've seen women with kids stay in one spot
I've seen women without kids rise to the top
Seen them comming and buddy up with the managers
Then seen the same women move up the ladder
I've seen women stand still when they work twice as hard
While men work half as hard and get twice as far

[Hook]My birth certificate reads: "Earth's most descriptive MC"
My death certificate'll read: "I'm dead, quit listening to me"
But while I'm here I'll use the planet as a platform
To plant panic in faggots and bash 'em with a mask on
My stamina's twice more to boost
I persuaded Anakin from the light side towards the truth
So panic in fright when handing me mics, wars insue
From the mic lord ya family likes more than you
Your head'll flinch when I nurse you to trauma
Cause my add libs are iller than any verse you can conjure
Megahertz will persecute you with honor
Weathermen'll take it one step further and murder ya momma
Climb the highest mountain, spit bottomless venom, shot 'em with rhythm
I don't get problems, I give 'em
My skin is made of the sharpest and thinnest blades
My notebook's more amazing than the one Guinness made
So when I rock what's not to like
I use your rhymes as an example of what not to write
Your faction is nothing, you'll get chewed for the hell of it
If rappin was fuckin ya whole crew would be celebit
Copywrite'll shit a million words before your first sentence drops
Or before my double engine stops, whichever comes first
Cause I'm determined to serve y'all with permanent words, murdering germs
By avoiding the most obvious method, my hobby is catching
And you can't dodge the Intrepid
Tis the season I'll ceast you breathing through ya chest
That's not a threat, it's the reason I was sent

(Chourus)
Fucksoundcheck the crowd wants it now
Fuck site, by scent I'll hunt you down
There's 5 senses 4 seasons 3 emcees 2 down 1 breathing 1 weasing
Anyone who dis O-H town, I'm shittin on
DJ's that don't have 2 copies of this, I'm shittin on
When we on stage shut up until my click is gone
Show respect before your bitch is gone

(Verse 2)
Piercing me in the eyes is like staring at the sun for a minute or 3
You'll close your eyes blink and still see an image of me
No camera can capture the essence
One thousand years nuthin changed, Dracula never had a reflection
Fuck rockin mics, I'm cracking domes with African Stones
My practice sessions a classic alone
Give me six minutes, teams a stripped gimmicks
I don't wanna be mainstream, I wanna PISS in it
I'll eat you twice, invite you back for thirds to lose
Try again and get ate 4 times like 32
By a raw crew that'll bury all you
With Freestyles that result in thousand dollar lawsuits
Hardcore, so while you spin on cardboard
I evole the practice of shit talking to an art form
And your banned from the mic
I get more Dap over the course of day
Then you'll see in the span of ya life
Damn right, but I got all day if y'all wanna learn the hard way
Show y'all how a thunder god plays
To sum it up, I'll Kill you
I don't blame you for being wack
I blame your fans for being dumb enough to feel you
Travel with me, I'll pass you by 10 styles, battle?
Y'all ain't no battle emcees, y'all are pen pals
You ran, I launch rapid torpedos
Now I'm dead on ya ass like rabbit fur speedos
God damnit I laminate what I write
After seeing how y'all are contaminating the mic
I animate when I strike right off the paper to cause random acts of
Slamming a fan's axe dead in ya man's back
My monstrous accomplice wands'll stun fast
With the promptness of a gun blast
I'm like, semen to semen I cum out the hardest
And I won't scalp tickets to a concert, I scalp the artist

(Repeat chorus)Sherminator..
Leak Leak Leak Leak Leak Leak
Leak Leak Leak Leak Leak Leak
Leak Leak Leak Leak Leak Leak Leak Leak
Leak Leak Leak Leak Leak Leak
Leak Leak Leak Leak Leak Leak

[Tame One]
My medulla oblongata's too proper for rhyming stupid
But embalmeing fluid life's got drama to it
Unusual pharmaceutical dip is a trip if you have the patience
If you go nuts dust is your travel agent
The bom-bom-monster of my genre
Swimming in purple rain Minnetonka
My lungs are rap practically bonkers
Like Yonkers I got locks
All you need is a jay, styles and louch like busdrop for this Bad Boy to Ruff Ryde
Deny the novice is obvious recognition
If you can't stand the leak get out the kitchen
Consider me different, usual suspect for missing equipment
Look forward to what I record for your shipments
I black out in an instance, off two point three seconds
Confessing that the nine at my waste ain't no measurement
Approach with caution, the leak brother addict with habits forming
So cheer to star at the end of the bar like my name was Norman

[Hook]
Old man on the floor, robbed and bludgeoned
His breath, running out he's like "Gimmesumdeath"
Child with a gunshot wound to the chest
Laying on a operating table like "Gimmesumdeath"
And a whole club of people drinking, scheming on flesh
Get blown out of the building thinking "Gimmesumdeath"
In my own endevours I'm not right I'm what's left
And if that passion burns out then "Gimmesumdeath"

[Cage]
Churchbells ringing, I'm only six
My foot on my dads chest, I'm pulling his tourniquet back to fix this
My skull pops out of its shell, I'm stable
Circulation's cut off from the jump rope tied to the coffee table
Something's pulling me, nylon cuts through my baby ankle
And it pops off, I'm sucked to the wall at lightspeed being strangled
With angel hair I'm dangled over
The edge of the universe is a razor blade I'm longing for closure
Decode and implode her with her own psychosis
And embrace her odor, I fold her over and over
Till she fits in the slits in my shoulder
Then pull her out and hold her a bloody baby in my palm growing colder
I'm out of my head, I'd rather be dead, just splatter me red
All over the wall then gather my friends
Throw a stone in my face and leave some flowers
Follow me, walk away or laugh for hours and hours

[Hook]

[Tame One]
Alter reality practically form brainstorms on songs
Bubble like my wet chunked on
Upon lift off, the fumes I'm giving off choke throats on both coast
Until all of the bom-bom gone
When something go wrong
With whole songs dedicated to medicated faded intoxicated sedated goings on
Head strong, dead wrong
Experimental generals out of the boomsquad, retarded after the jar gone

[Cage]
Welcome to Waterworld, pull the covergirl over my face
Chuck on draw then walk away from this place
It's cinematic, irrational, tragic magic
You can smell a fresh bag of wet pulling the CD out the package
This whole planet of shit, I love this horrible nation
Escape another nine-to-five with leakie glorification
Ex-patient, rather puff purple stuff and stay mental
To the next dip sea, all of hell love Cage Kennylz

[Hook]

*Fades Out*[Hook]
Come on say it loud
Look what we handin' down
Don't it make you proud?
Look what we handin' down

Come on say it loud
Look what we handin' down
Don't it make you proud?
Look what we handin' down

[Verse 1: Blueprint]
My momma gave me Donny Hathaway
"Young, Gifted and Black"
I miss the positivity, I wanna bring it back
But Rap nowadays is by a bunch of ignorant cats
No "Young, Gifted and Black"
Just guns, bitches and crack
I react by turning off BET
And Sambos telling me what blackness is supposed to be
Used to give us world news, now it's all videos
Replaced Tavis Smiley with reality shows
If you let the TV define what black is
You think ice and violence is all we think that matters
I guess this is what happens when rappers look up to thugs
And kids look up to rappers
To some of y'all if I don't talk about the gat enough
Or sell crack enough, I ain't black enough
But I rather be a pro at being myself
Than be an idiot trying to be somebody else, what

[Hook]
Come on say it loud
Look what we handin' down
Don't it make you proud?
Look what we handin' down

Come on say it loud
Look what we handin' down
Don't it make you proud?
Look what we handin' down

[Verse 2]
I'm at the bus stop with my bike
Been there for a while
Moms taught me how to catch this route when I was a child
Another kid walks up, freakin' a Black & Mild
Fifteen, same age I learn shit's wild
An older lady walks up, greets us with a smile
Asks how we both doing and sits down
She knows what's it's like to grow up in the South
Civil Rights when the whites was hosing us down
I started thinking to myself that even though the times were tougher
They still took time out to speak to one another
But look at us, me and this young brother
Acting to proud to break down and speak to each other
So inside I felt ashamed
Not sure of how to but I wanna change
And as long as I'm alive, then the fact remains
That it's never too late for us to break the chains
Come on, y'all

[Hook]
Come on say it loud
Look what we handin' down
Don't it make you proud?
Look what we handin' down

Come on say it loud
Look what we handin' down
Don't it make you proud?
Look what we handin' down

[Scratching]
Things is bound to change[Intro]
Light it up! Yeah
Put it in the air (high lights, high lights)
(high lights, high lights)

[Verse 1]
Bubble kush, cat piss, purple rain
Hash plant, thai stick, white widow, wreck the train
Indo, outdo', to the brain
Orange brown redhead, green, the potent strains
Bongs, blunts, and zig-zags
Bubblers, bowls, blowin out of big bags
Twist up, roll up, pack up, hit that
Scent so strong in the air, where you get that?
Afghan, Pakistan, lamb's bread, skunk
Acapulco Goldy, hydro funk
Blueberry, chronic, chocolate chunk
Northern lights, buddha bless, Cannabis Cup
And that's what's up

(high lights, high lights)
(high lights, high lights)

[Verse 2]
The legislation wants regulation
Want to interfere with my cultivation
My personal usage for meditation
And medication to help the patients
Cancer, asthma, emphysema
Back pains, migraines, grass is greener
Glaucoma, arthritis, epileptic seizures
Medicine man make me a believer
Cheech & Chong, "Reefer Madness"
"Half Baked," _How High_ heal the masses
Light that, puff that, dump the ashes
Take 2, take 3, take 4 and pass it

(high lights, high lights)
(high lights, high lights)

[Verse 3]
Super silver, Hawaiian haze
Sativa, indica, Solomon's grave
Genesis, chapter one verse twelve ways
Marijuana, hashish, everybody blaze
Fuels and fibers, energy saved
When the natives met the travelers, guess what they gave
All praise due to the seeds they raised
And the people all over the world that smoke J's
Kings and queens, musicians, actors
Everyday, working class, stoners, slackers
Low key blazers and green bowl packers
If Mary Jane is in the house then I'm gon' mack her

[Outro]
(high lights, high lights)
This is dedicated to everybody in the world that smoke weed
Legalize it
(high lights, high lights)
Eat it, use it for fibers, Aceyalone
