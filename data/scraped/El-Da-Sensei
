It's hard in these streets
From Mecca to Jerusalem
All day every day

[Verse 1: Vast Aire]
Toe flex we bout to blow like octane
You know Cannibal Ox got mad slang
Who cares what you're named
They say a man who repeats himself is insane
I mix my saliva with propane
Flame on I spit that hot fire with Dylan
And stay inside the line with crayons
My whole aura is neon, ultra violet
Come out your mouth
I might get ultra violent
Now it's so quiet
You was popping that junk
Now it's so silent
Here's another token
We are the chosen
Wolves in the coven
Blade of the Ronin

[Verse 2: el da sensi]
We deliver the livest your novice we polish
Acknowledge ?? mad men, shottas and god fathers
I rock the flow brick city bandit, im doctor no
Star studded glow cardio bars we give the go
Administer quotes
Diminish folks in minutes call it dinner time
Eat your food, rude or push harder to the finish line
?? shine, musically we harness
Due process and Marcus flawless bombers
All time writers and fly garments
Marvellous talking prior markings, fire for warning
Inspired informant desired the entire performance
Niggas is boring we got the remedy virus in storage
Hennesy pouring, AOF, cannibal ox recording ah

[Verse 3: Vordal Mega]
Formalities and certain chances and variant circumstances
In surge of advancing
To miss the pivotal point
Integral click and digitally went spittin'
Never that vacant transmission
Getting off ways like jet motto
Livin in ways you set morals the righteous path
Write on pads and lace audio, keeping kids
Being more intuitive monstrous
Learning origami, with folding paper into Ferraris
We move conscience, speed gazing, navigation
Looking like lasers, through night mazes

[Verse 4: Tame One]
Did you hear of it?
Im harsh as the march chapter in the spearmint
With enough psychoactive synthetic substances to begin with
Generate combine within, to transcending
The second Nordic artefact independent descendent
Psychedelic therapy magic, meditation
The ritual is verical spiritual dedication
Well established hip hop savage with the cabbage
On average with multiple sounds of blackness
This is black magic, true art from new jeruz new arc
With two part documentaries fireworks shoot sparks
Go beyond we draw fire like kobes arm
In hip hop i go grimlock on stages that they throw me on

[Verse 5: U-God]
First class nigga
She on me like axe on my chest
Fresh like crest, straight headshots only lames aim for the best
Im taking 99.9 percent of the bet
Y'all can have all the rest, stress
Intravenously i feed these niggas the truth serum
Spit fire like he got a dragon in the booth with him
Hold your head and stand still
Balance the equilibrium
Process the beat, create heat
Faster then the pentium processor
Through the hood known as the pie stretcher
Measure the texture of the fish scale upon the dresser
Own a sea biscuit win by a nose on the track
Live at the aqueduct
NY yank on the hat
Whos up to bat
Sending a SOS to the slums of shao-lin
And to the late night husters on the north side of the island
Surveillance at the corner my eye
Bitch get off the snapchat and drive
Being followed because i sold a thousand instgrams, glide[Verse One] [El Da Sensei]:
We cop it off and blast, brag with slang editorial
Man they never called you when the loot becomes recordable
Audible pro I smash lines into winery
Locked in the booth with the neighbors is where you find me
Trippin' from days back, but now I'm futuristic
2009 still thrill with linguistics
Dwell underneath in the thick of the beat
Pick up your feet and wake you from your slumbering sleep
Pummel the weak and spit like street sweepers in broad day
Spit it the hard way like Cosby on an off day
Crazed and throw it together in a better context
Always brand new like the cat who ain't signed yet
Rhyme vet, in shape like cardio in the gym
Heartless with the pen, regardless who you send
Tim, Socks and me, together we team
Blowin' off steam, Returners you know the routine

[Chorus]
Cats wanna front on the name
"I ain't trippin'"
I'mma keep showin' up on the bill so deal with it
Heat rocks still kickin' my dude
"I ain't trippin'"
Cock back, hot raps and you know we got that

We keep a rappers feet to the flames
"I ain't trippin'"
Packin' with capacity crowds so stay flippin'
"I ain't trippin'"
"No, I'm not playin' with ya"

[Verse Two] [Ghettosocks]:
Dude, I'm not trippin', your tunes are not hittin'
The Sock spittin', clock chicks gin on the rocks sippin'
My Pulp Fiction will knock you out the box limpin'
And hot writtens, clown kids like Robot Chicken
My clique's bangin' like chip wagons packed with ?
We called your blog "Raw Dawg" and crashed the server
Enthusiasm curber, we'll smash your promo
Playin' hot potato with your head and catch a murder
After I lash out I'm sewing your eyelids
Fly shit, burn your retinas and fill up your mind quick
I call your chick Dell cause she's building a virus
That'll cast away your friends like on Gilligan's Island
Look, even your mom loves to see this kid rhyme
But when you free I actually see the stink lines
I'm three to six times, easily this big time
Cause to crush they A game I never need to bring mine

[Chorus]
We keep a rappers feet to the flames
"I ain't trippin'"
Packin' with capacity crowds so stay flippin'
"I ain't trippin'"

Cats wanna front on the name
"I ain't trippin'"
I'mma keep showin' up on the bill so deal with it
Heat rocks still kickin' my dude
"I ain't trippin'"
Cock back, hot raps and you know we got that
"No, I'm not playin' with ya"Yo, yo, yo, check it
I make the past dash for the post to most indeed
My dough speeds approve feed, what I believe top seed
I write scrolls like Judei Sensei, my tongue real sharp
On the target shit, that your mind can't shield
Most can't feel, the appeal I set upon the mass
Niggas speakin ?, one point seven grams of vocal hash
I splash like Hank and Bank flows in many waters
Shamed your game even before the fourth quarter
My order is brief, I chant meaning for demeanor
With my cleaner outlook, my moves advancin like a rook
Took, time to design, but I incline, intertwine my
Shit upon your mind, check, for my warnin signs cause
I'm a hazardous graduate of the schools of fatness
My inner flows like, water in a cactus
But y'all can't see the science in this - I'm like
The day you bought you first LP, from Kane or Blastmaster Kris
Twist trees, the ordinary nig would never toke
Well over here we catch a tree but overseas we catch a boat
I wrote these degrees for the backpacks, travellin on foot
The low Guess sag, Walkman and a notebook
And Goddesses with their ear to the norm
Cause the new generation got this whole shit wrong..

Who's the fool?  My tools only used to bring elaborate
Shit on ?, activist servin my addicts (why?)
Fuck up those who dance by chance a champ be fly
Smack that ass that go by and she won't ask me why
I'm tokin never gun totin I'm potent with the word spoken
Leak the speak nigga, pass that, you're chokin
With a minimum dose, toast for taste, for your liking in advance
Enhance thoughts so, comp take a chance
In my world, only the true stand in my circumfrence
They're bumpin shit, with lyrics so much they're mad abundence
I'm like the first Dutch of your day, Sensai
I'm rallyin carry the load, as my pen explode
My tech shows no weakness, behold my uniqueness
Daily Rap News messenger, Under Pressure
I raise the stakes on fakes like chips to, a gambler
You're catchin my phrase like, I passed to Wes Chandler
My style not the R&B code, but the true category
Concoting flows in Dexter's Laboratory
Switching up styles like teams of Robert Horry
It'll take me days to tell my tales of fame and glory
Been down long roads leadin through, the Swiss Alps
Where every chick in town got blonde hair in they scalp
What I'm about, is still refreshin your mind, guys are blind
Cause what you find is the shit, is the downfall of rapkind
Askin the same question, all the time whassup with yo' shit?
Yo sit back and focus, beginners notice:
My speech is never an impediment
Always a step of it to show I have intelligence
So, MC El Da Sensei, O-U-T
For the nine-eight season we be, out..[Intro]
Yeah, Yeah
Here we go
Jersey stand up
A 7 Heads presentation
El Da Sensei
All y'all just relax
Sit back, take a drink
1,2

[Verse 1]
Yo, take a step inside the booth
With no BET films documentin' the proof
No twangs in my slang cause I come from the east
Known for heatin' hot-ass beats and bullets from the beast
I'm just one of many and I'm here to unleash
My presentation as a piece of myself to eat
7 Heads is the label and I rep that shit
Musical magic, fantastic, on the average
My rendition of the classics, rendition of the last true and livin'
But alas my edition on arrival
Logical, melodical
Trying to get the fans and more cash and respect that's possible
Straight up, I got the early 90's flow
Slam upon tracks like Booker T on Monday Nitro
You fiend for my taste like puttin' fingers in the cake mix
Rock off kicks and harmonize like Take 6

[Hook] Repeat 2x
Relax, think
Back, when shit was fat
Relax, Relate, Remember
Not long ago when we all knew what was the agenda

Debate this in any presidential candidate
I spit great from the BX to the Great Lakes
Dedicate this to my dad who past
And to all my late relatives from years past
To my son: God Bless, you relieve my stress
Keep me striving for the best in this industry mess
It's true to the fact that I'm not like ya'll
Cause we Tom Hill Billy niggas tryin' to ball
"What happened to the sound?" what everbody's askin'
Guns clappin', top emcees clashin'
Well fuck that, real tracks at your service
No need to get nervous as you get into the verses
Natural exceptional... enough about myself
If it ain't about myself, then it ain't nothin' else
So Relax is the title, El Da Sen' online
Mark off your favorite joints then press rewind

[Hook] Repeat 2x
Relax, think
Back, when shit was fat
Relax, Relate, Remember
Not long ago when we all knew what was the agenda

[Outro]
Like I said before
El Da Sensei
Relax everybody
I got you
Just sit back
Enjoy the music
Just remember when we was doin' everything in the 90's
And the 80's
Yeah, yeah...[El Da Sensei]
Yo yo yo, huh hah
Smooth diff' in this, y'all know what's going on with this right here
Yo it's Shawn J., bust it
It's goin down like that
El Da Sensei hah, for the '9-8
F.T., Mike Zoot, Prince Po' huh, Pharoahe Monch
The Frontline, huh
You don't know what's up with this, uhh uhh
You don't know what's up with this
Doing drama like dis do', yo check it out check it out

My vendetta in this form of musical song
Is to enlighten and brighten the mind through instrument and rhyme
And fix those inadequate flows that don't adapt
Makin snacks on wax plates for DJs to scratch

[Pharoahe Monch]
Fast slash, cross hatch slash, cross patch
Every word of mine will be verbally so tight to match
That or that I hit you harder than Caterpillar trucks
In the lab where we collaborate or matter will erupt

[Mike Zoot]
From a, music martyr, bust mortar, break the order
Torch your sound texture, fire water's in my aura
Your future forefather, your new wave slave wrapped in chains and amulets
And hard to earn assets

[F.T.]
Yo, niggas game playing but not name saying
My aim's sprayin, I get mine that's why you stay waitin
And vacating, whether you know it or not, I'mma blow up the spot
If you owe me a lot, I'mma show up with Glocks

[Prince Poetry]
And you're still wet, pull up your socks, suspend the art
Sizzle like woks, underground spots, from the city to the boondocks
Bounce, double wishbone suspension like shocks
Multiple plans and plots, word

[Hook - all]
You know we shine with rhymes all the time
Keep in mind don't test these MCs who bless (Word)
Test these MCs
You know we shine with rhymes all the time
Keep in mind don't test these MCs who bless (Word)
Test these MCs (Word what ugh)
Test these MCs

[El Da Sensei]
I spit fire satire, indeed bleed, phenomenal demographics
Broadcast my rhyme forecast to eager addicts
Pave a path many can't outlast
Who these cats who blast gats rehearsing lines for a movie cast?
But as a centrail, blaze the track engage
Instamatic sporadic insight pays for days
With their sickening floss, flip on tracks like Dominique Dawes
Pause, date back, flows is getting flashback

[Pharoahe Monch]
My existence, spirits in animated film
Three-dimensionally roller scoped
With cloaking devices, skates, stoges and a motor boat
I hold the Pope for ransom, it's
The handsomest, assassinating Satan
Leaving the world Marilyn Manson-less
I'm in the streets like Sesame
The recipe - to kill, attain da mil/DeMille like Cecille B
The rest'll be the aftermath, the most got statistics
Pharoahe Monch, Steve Post about to lift it

[Mike Zoot]
I gotta get mine, give it back so you can get yours

[Prince Poetry]
I gotta get mine, give it back so you can get yours

[Mike Zoot]
I gotta get mine, give it back so you can get yours
Yo yo UHH WHAT

I'm leavin your staff mated, making these crabs hate it
I lotta fags rate it and thought I got stagnated
I'm not some rap nigga that you're dying to meet
Just another hungry brother real hungry and trying to eat
And in the streets you better rely on your feet
Babies is feelin iron, crying to sleep
Plus the government is supplying the heat
They going psychotic in prison cos of the economic additions
Plus sex and drugs in the bleachers

[F.T.]
3-4 come up, run up in beefcake gun butt-ups
Crush truck chains, the wiry gold frames
Chains sums up, the dollars, white collar, blue Range
Eat my dust up, ten in the bucket in the left lane gaining momentum
Cum sending comers, fair game, a lot of sumtin sumtin
All in or nothin, silence the sufferin
Can't stand the struggling, some resume games to stain jugglin
I muscled in and scribbled my name

[Prince Poetry]
Belittle your brain, the true grain riddle your frame
Got you forfeiting the bitch by the middle of the game
Hostile, impossible to stop below the free
Buck em down, shook em nothin at the top of the key
Prince, omnipotent, magnificent moves, strategic
Smash joints, leaving the track paraplegic
Repeat it for those who need it, niggas catch the vibe
Fish 'n grits, hot sauce, forever embedded inside

Chorus

[Mike Zoot - Outro]
What, ugh, yo, yeah come on, yeah yeah
By my nigga El Da Sensei, Mike Zoot, ynahI'msayin?
Okay, F.T., Guesswhyld
I gotta fresh styleSample: Sean Price from Heltah Skeltah's "Soliders Gone Psycho"

Straight from the under, I make niggas wonder why... (x2)

[Verse 1: Main Flow]

I got a hotter steez, drive with exotic keys
It's not an ease, bless niggas like they got to sneeze
Connect, bless me with a lot of trees
Now I can plot a freeze, go with the wind when I spot a breeze
From fake necklaces to bootleg Timb sales
We all about the Malachi Z. York and stem cells
And won't hesitate to let the trigger blow
Cause all of my seeds just make a bigger flow
I like the time, and repent for a lying sin
Leviathan, the higher pen, I write words to violins
Cash to stack a van, up against the cracker plan
The blacker man still got the ammo like Pakistan
Nice goal, hit the city and dice roll
And slice holes, like Lombardi at the Ice Bowl
Hit with the wham-o, three soldiers coming in camo
What up fam-o, you know we still got the ammo

[Hook: Main Flow - 2x]

Man the ship, with ammo and command the grip
Staying equipped, moving hand to hand to flip
Land and dip, with ammo I'm the man that trip
Plan to rip the tongue is like a gun with a banana clip

[Verse 2: Godilla]

Blows like a fire arm, and they got on safety
Play my cards right, God's right, something like AC
Understudy of the pawn's rock, kins and the Jay-z's
Niggas hate me, take three, try to stop me
Fold each and every one of you, origami
Shit on every track I'm on, port-a-potty
War with papi, verbally I'm all tsunami
Rain on 'em every time, for pass the cloudy
Open sixteen I'm aim like an orange with hobby
The porch of army, iller man handle the scandal
Still got ammo, your panel now fall into shambles
Hang low, get cancelled like the WB
Hungry to eat, hustle to breath, you ain't fucking with me
Simple math I divide a couple hundred MC's
(M.O.P. Sample: Not your average...) with bricks and lyrics
Aim specific, we got more shots than a biscuit

[Hook - 2x]

[Verse 3: El Da Sensei]

Target on scope, slip through the darkness in trees
Peep the hardest indeed, make every goddess devi
My clip full of ammo, magazines come in threes
Boot strap, new rap, simmer army fatigues
Brave years of hardships, now I make that hard shit
Mosh pit, marksman, gun blast regardless
Corner the market and set if off like Frankie
Cause these niggas is ass, and y'all want to thank me
Mainly I boast for the shit that I stand for
Allegiance is completed when y'all hittin' the dance floor
I never lose sight, shotta that's too nice
Have more than two fights when they was hogging the mike
Modeling type, my looks succeed, would you imagine
Mid 30's my nigga, and still make it happen
I hate the past tense, so bye for now
With Snowgoons, J. Sands, Main Flow show you how

[Interlude - Soldiers Gone Psycho Sample]

Straight from the under, I make niggas wonder why
My parabellum be swelling, cerebellums when ya dwelling
Straight from the under, I make niggas wonder why
The caucazoid, you void, my niggas rebellin'

[Verse 4: J. Sands]

Ayo, my man in East Orange told me the streets warrin'
Ran the castle, dodge the shells that keep pourin'
Early morning, until the night transformin'
Far from dormant, the freaks come out without warning
The shit sound like the north side, killer county
Home sweet home, but feeling like an out of townie
I don't fuck with snakes, but yo they still around me
Plus the jake carry heat just to grill a brownie
Straight up, shit is real, let the trey-eight buck
Better not tell a soul when you ain't wake up
Cause some boys know the feds better than they know the ledge
Big gates, blow the bread, or some youngin blow they head
Uhh...right off the shoulder
The kids getting older and the world's getting colder
So I dip to So'Cal, lay low and profile
Cause I got ammo that make it go...BLAOW (blaow, blaow)[Verse One] [Sean Price]:
Get rich quick scam
Lick dick bitch scram
Bastards to biscuits
Oh shit, flip bam!
Bam Margera
Hanna Barbera
Death metal leather jacket on Pantera
Grand era, Grand Old Oppy
Grand standin'
Evel Knievel jumped 'cross the damn Grand Canyon
Last Man Standin'
Bruce Willis step cock
Next movie off point, fuckin' Mos Def shot
Body in the truck been there for two days
So the car drive by with the boomin' human
Check in the mail like Newman
Hahaha, get it
Checkin' the male like Newman
(Yeah I got it I got it)
Duke you rappin' like Rappin Duke
The Da Ha Da Ha, bitch nigga scratch your boot
That's when the right hand froze thinkin'
"How much coke did I sniff with a ? nose"
That's more than a little bit
Calcium deprived because mommy got little tits
Down south niggas listen to Lil' Flip
Up north niggas listen to Lil' Fame
(M.O.P.)
We both listen to Lil' Wayne
We takin' your little chain

[Verse Two] [Bekay]:
I come from a place where we play off cops but the bitches fuck from free
Suck and pluck you duckin' me, get stuck and bleed, Brooklyn's ugly
Uhh, even the ad-libs stab kids
And find your body parts chopped up in a bag like spare ribs
Walkin' around like a zombie
Talk of the town, stalkin' em now
Chasin', slowly Jason, walk calmly
Brooklyn gully, lookin' ugly, pull jooks we hungry
My man got caught, the judge threw the book at money
Now he doin' 23 and 1, never see the sun
Plus he never see his son and that's fucked up
A bitter craps, spit a fact
Tough talk? Get rid of that
Your girl gave so much head we nicknamed her "fitted cap"
Dudes will hustle outside your condominium
They flip more rocks than a pissed off Palestinian
You get clapped dead if I wanna
But that ain't a mac it's just an Atari I bought off the crackhead on the corner
Brooklyn!

[Scratch Hook]:
"Everyday in the street"
"Same shit different day, but still the same"
"It's most real"
"In da hood"

[Verse Three] [El Da Sensei]:
Niggas we movin' off the block like we pitchin' hand in hand
Slots takin' by man to man
Combat that's on demand
H.D
Hot demographics, ?
Killer beats that make me
And there's more that's given lately
So, at your service ?
Electrify like third rails and tunes that never fail
By request y'all niggas call on me
With the chemistry that's built since 1993
Lavishly I dress the rhymes to coincide
With the foremost sound, get you aroused and polarized
Now things change and the flows got sicker
Delivery's slick and the tracks are more thicker
Start where we left off
And reincarnate
The all star quota that many seen as a lost art
Sean, Bekay and me
Out of this trifeful
Songs that cause spite and shooters wanna snipe you
{gunshot}

[Scratch Hook]:
"Everyday in the street"
"Same shit different day, but still the same"
"It's most real"

My whole aura is neon, ultra violet

Bitch get off the snapchat and drive
Being followed because i sold a thousand instgrams, glide[Verse One] [El Da Sensei]:
I burn more than L's but
Walls and stairwells
With the broadest of markers and colors they can't sell
Caps of many kinds and styles and hand skills
Straightest of lines and characters hard to build
Sketch pro pad, merchant workin' and it shows
Back drop is life like with cans it flows
Portraits are scorchin' and blends are important
Energy surrounds all burners puttin' thought in
Color wheel drill with the face so crisp
Flow master tools complete the outfit
Rubber gloves and masks
Fumes from the past
And it's still relevant and evident from the tag
Brag on my Wild Style ? not a secret
Wrong Side the first hit, in '94 we leaked it
New era for bombin' and always be the shit so
Toys get in line for brand new starter kits

[Verse Two] [Skit Slam]:
Yo, I wanna thank the Bronx for the hip hop invention
The music, the breakin' that got everyone attention
My backspin's longer than a pen life sentence
Wave lockin' and bendin', create new inventions
Strike a pose air flare, one arm extending
Apple Jacks on your head and start spinnin'
Head glide, suicide and leg swipes
You had to practice day and night to get nice
I used to up rock, for money at the bus stops
At least I wasn't tryin' to hustle at the drug spot
Who remember Puma sweat suits and Adidas?
Fat laces to make your footwork the neatest
Pull out the cardboard
There's none around?
Well let's get busy on the hard floor
I'm thinkin' 'bout the moves that bring chills
Moonwalkin'
Nah, windmills
No hands, if you advanced with skill
Battle while the DJ on the wheels of steel
It's all love though
B-Boys and B-Girls are brethren
And show mad love to hip hop legends

Ayo man up brother
I speak with enough power to chain lightening bolts and handcuff thunder
When I, use the mic to control the crowd
An MC, never phoney, a master of ceremony
Somethin' always been inside and nobody had ever told me homie
I was born to lead and teach youth
Study the culture and it's deep roots
It's my job to, get on the mic and speak truth
Yo, honesty the policy
For a top MC it gotta be
Speak from your heart without apology
I use every second to flee to show you
Even if you're not ready to see the rebel in me
The difference is
When you rock, the crowd evaporate
But I can take a rowdy bunch and show you how to captivate
The voice of the people, speak truly is my duty
And whoever you be, know you can't do nothin' to me

When your favorite MC's had no major airplay (What?)
No video, car, crib or large deals (Huh?)
Only a single got you city-wide appeal (Damn!)
Showin your skill upon the mic, originality was key
And the law was not to bite in the highest degree (I hear that)
Plus you had to battle cats for respect
(Like Moe Dee, Busy Bee, MC Shan and KRS?)
Yeah kid, it goes deeper but you get the picture
You had to have lyrics and plus hot beats to get the mixture
As always you had to have the ill DJ
Technician with precision, switch the fader all day
A must to have these additives to smash and battle kids
(Well yo, that's like today's cats?) Nah, that's a negative
Today's MC's don't possess these qualities
So I put you to the test on this musical quest

[ El ]
What's the question?
[ Kaos ]
What made the music change through the time?
[ El ]
What's the answer?
They started gettin paid to rhyme
[ El ]
What's the question?
[ Kaos ]
What happened to the culture as a whole?
[ El ]
What's the answer?
Too many MC's sold their soul
[ El ]
What's the question?
[ Kaos ]
What happened to the MC's from the past?
[ El ]
What's the answer?
Not enough fans and no cash
[ El ]
What's the question?
[ Kaos ]
How do we get it back like before?
[ El ]
What's the answer?
More skills and niggas gotta be raw
[ El ]
What's the question?
[ Kaos ]
How so many groups fall apart?
[ El ]
What's the answer?
They in it but it's not from the heart

[ VERSE 2: El Da Sensei (& DJ Kaos) ]
Look at the records in this store, know the faces and the names
All the places that they come from and staked it as their claim
Acclaimed writers like Kane, G Rap, Doug and the Biz
DJ's like Cool V, Mister Cee in the mix
(Yo, I heard this one kid who made beats and rhymed correct)
You must be talkin 'bout this man here, his name is Lord Finesse
(It was another cat too, yo this nigga beats was hot
He was down with CL Smooth) The Soul Brother Pete Rock
Plenty others I could name but the most by far
These pioneers most revered, group named Gang Starr
Put it down through the years, most respected by the peers
For Primo's hot beats, Guru's voice so clear
(Yeah, I know about them, "Hard to Earn" one of the best
What about the Cella Dwellas, Special Ed, and Das EFX?)
Ah shit, you got some history, you're buildin on your lessons
When you see me next time be refined for your confession

[ Kaos ]
Yo, I'mma cop this, word up
[ El ]
Yeah, yo do that, you do that
[ Kaos ]
I heard this on "Future Flavas" the other night
[ El ]
Okay, okay
[ Kaos ]
I'mma get two of them

[ El ]
What's the question?
[ Kaos ]
How long can it last like this?
[ El ]
What's the answer?
When all MC's are gone and they're missed
[ El ]
What's the question?
[ Kaos ]
What happened to the sound of the East?
[ El ]
What's the answer?
Niggas went south to tryin to eat
[ El ]
What's the question?
[ Kaos ]
When the niggas gonna dig back in the crates?
[ El ]
What's the answer?
When certain niggas stop tryin to hate
[ El ]
What's the question?
[ Kaos ]
When will all the bullshit stop?
[ El ]
What's the answer?
When your top MC's stop gettin dropped
[ El ]
What's the question?
[ Kaos ]
What you say your name was again, kid?
[ El ]
Yo, El Da Sensei, man, Artifacts, man
[ Kaos ]
Aight peace
[ El ]
Yeah, we comin from the Bricks
[ Kaos ]
Hold up
"Wrong Side of da Tracks"..
[ El ]
Yeah man
[ Kaos ]
Yo, that's you on this cover!
[ El ]
...that's me
[ Kaos ]
You didn't tell me you had joints out
[ El ]
I know, I'm doin work, I'm workin, yo

Always workin
[ Kaos ]
Peace yo
[ El ]
No doubt
I check you on the re
OneSample: Sean Price from Heltah Skeltah's "Soliders Gone Psycho"

Straight from the under, I make niggas wonder why... (x2)

[Verse 1: Main Flow]

I got a hotter steez, drive with exotic keys
It's not an ease, bless niggas like they got to sneeze
Connect, bless me with a lot of trees
Now I can plot a freeze, go with the wind when I spot a breeze
From fake necklaces to bootleg Timb sales
We all about the Malachi Z. York and stem cells
And won't hesitate to let the trigger blow
Cause all of my seeds just make a bigger flow
I like the time, and repent for a lying sin
Leviathan, the higher pen, I write words to violins
Cash to stack a van, up against the cracker plan
The blacker man still got the ammo like Pakistan
Nice goal, hit the city and dice roll
And slice holes, like Lombardi at the Ice Bowl
Hit with the wham-o, three soldiers coming in camo
What up fam-o, you know we still got the ammo

[Hook: Main Flow - 2x]

Man the ship, with ammo and command the grip
Staying equipped, moving hand to hand to flip
Land and dip, with ammo I'm the man that trip
Plan to rip the tongue is like a gun with a banana clip

[Verse 2: Godilla]

Blows like a fire arm, and they got on safety
Play my cards right, God's right, something like AC
Understudy of the pawn's rock, kins and the Jay-z's
Niggas hate me, take three, try to stop me
Fold each and every one of you, origami
Shit on every track I'm on, port-a-potty
War with papi, verbally I'm all tsunami
Rain on 'em every time, for pass the cloudy
Open sixteen I'm aim like an orange with hobby
The porch of army, iller man handle the scandal
Still got ammo, your panel now fall into shambles
Hang low, get cancelled like the WB
Hungry to eat, hustle to breath, you ain't fucking with me
Simple math I divide a couple hundred MC's
(M.O.P. Sample: Not your average...) with bricks and lyrics
Aim specific, we got more shots than a biscuit

[Hook - 2x]

[Verse 3: El Da Sensei]

Target on scope, slip through the darkness in trees
Peep the hardest indeed, make every goddess devi
My clip full of ammo, magazines come in threes
Boot strap, new rap, simmer army fatigues
Brave years of hardships, now I make that hard shit
Mosh pit, marksman, gun blast regardless
Corner the market and set if off like Frankie
Cause these niggas is ass, and y'all want to thank me
Mainly I boast for the shit that I stand for
Allegiance is completed when y'all hittin' the dance floor
I never lose sight, shotta that's too nice
Have more than two fights when they was hogging the mike
Modeling type, my looks succeed, would you imagine
Mid 30's my nigga, and still make it happen
I hate the past tense, so bye for now
With Snowgoons, J. Sands, Main Flow show you how

[Interlude - Soldiers Gone Psycho Sample]

Straight from the under, I make niggas wonder why
My parabellum be swelling, cerebellums when ya dwelling
Straight from the under, I make niggas wonder why
The caucazoid, you void, my niggas rebellin'

[Verse 4: J. Sands]

Ayo, my man in East Orange told me the streets warrin'
Ran the castle, dodge the shells that keep pourin'
Early morning, until the night transformin'
Far from dormant, the freaks come out without warning
The shit sound like the north side, killer county
Home sweet home, but feeling like an out of townie
I don't fuck with snakes, but yo they still around me
Plus the jake carry heat just to grill a brownie
Straight up, shit is real, let the trey-eight buck
Better not tell a soul when you ain't wake up
Cause some boys know the feds better than they know the ledge
Big gates, blow the bread, or some youngin blow they head
Uhh...right off the shoulder
The kids getting older and the world's getting colder
So I dip to So'Cal, lay low and profile
Cause I got ammo that make it go...BLAOW (blaow, blaow)[Intro: Sample from the song: "Every day is just an extension of yesterday" by The Troublemakers]
"Every day is just an extension of yesterday, a hassle
And getting out of bed in the morning is like slow suicide
Because he knows just what's going down"

[Verse 1: El Da Sensei]
Agony and anguish, body count nameless
Gangsters, niggers in the east coast, shameless
Now move mostly, cops watch closely
Years in the making and it’s not how it's supposed to be
Used to be a curfew, used to have truancy
Now kids are rude, different colour is the enemy
Older cats scared cause they show no fear
Lack of respect and taking over spots is clear
In the news, few details of the crime scene
Death is the outcome for innocent teens
Any bystander, blocks have cameras
Have second thoughts, bring your brandishing the hammer

[Hook: El Da Sensei & Kaze, several samples overlap with the vocals]
It’s not a movie when your head’s up, shake down, faced with the toolie
Cash it up for revival in this warfare every block is survival
Realise it’s the stars and stripes operating crime legalized
All day every day, in the USA

[Verse 2: Kaze]
Black president, educated North Cak residents
Exposed hidden agendas and lies are evident
Got us representing causes I don’t want no part of
Bush is like Nino and we living in The Carter
A lost soul, wonder where the gospel is
Cause the government got us like hostages
And the kids don’t read, being smart ain’t cool
But some 10 year old’ll come through and shoot up your school
Banks is collapsing, gas is berserk shit; I spend half of my money going back and forth to work
So after 8 years of Bush killing the earth, hell yeah I’ll vote Obama for whatever it’s worth

[Hook]

[Verse 3: El Da Sensei & Kaze]
Government officials neglect the poverty and serve the wealthy
While chicks work the pole unhealthy
Welfare recipients, laid off work
Claim child support and living off family first

Damn El, this ain’t how it's supposed to be
We eating black cheese and fruits, stamp groceries
All these home forced closed and these jobs laid off
A wall street seven hundred billion debt paid off

Wish to be college-bound on a scholarship
Pop dudes strung out and your moms won’t acknowledge it
Prison bars just more than sixteen
Life bid, full term, for erasing a dream

Don’t be confused by the shit they put on the tube
And the New York Post and the damn Fox News
It’s the blood of the Indians and the chains of the slaves that made the;
“land of the free, and the home of the brave”

[Hook]

[Outro: Sample from the song: "Every day is just an extension of yesterday" by The Troublemakers]
"I would gladly lay myself down
If only to see, one me set free;
From castration
From alienation
From regimentation
From the dehumanization
From americanization"[Intro][El Da Sensei talking]:
Listen. El Da Sensei. Returners. We got this project right here, called The Grown Table. Most of y'all won't understand, but when you hear the music, you gonna know. Yes, and when you hear that shit. When you come up to me, I'mma look at you and just say, hahaha, aight then
"Aight then"

[Verse One]:
Market myself as, the last of a breed
And fly a banner and flag that means I'm guaranteed
So fall back I give a warning like shots
And not the kind you receive when you visit your doc
Mush niggas in the face with my hand and bare feed back
I'm from the streets where dealers come off a G-Pack
I splurge with words to keep you interested
Time invested and rhymes so you're never neglected
Directed in scenes that's action filled
Cats appeal that will shatter shields with battlin' skills
Motion layer, rhyme sayer I'm king
Never in between only in sheets you hear the screams
And moans cause I'm known for long strokes and back shots
I push a little harder just to knock her back out
Pull an exclusive
Showin' and provin'
Cuts and usage, so track the movement

[Chorus]:
When we put it all together put the shit on smash
"Cats ain't built for this"
Every line is exact and Returners on the scratch
"On the two turntables" - MC Shan 'Marley Marl Scratch'
"Show 'em what we got" - Tha Alkaholiks 'DAAAM!'
Musically we inclined, combination intertwine
"I don't fuck around dunny" - Prodigy 'Keep It Thoro'
"This most real" - G.O.D. Part III 'We Will Survive'
Never steer you wrong, every element is strong
"The game's about to change" - The Perceptionists 'Let's Move'
"Aight then" - Big L 'Put It On'

[Verse Two]:
I chose my words wisely like Ron Isley
I write it from an age golden so your response don't surprise me
I've lively and wired up for sound
Electric when I'm selected so give me a pound
I'm lethal with no equal, bitch I spit for my people
While your whole motherfuckin' game is see through
And transparent it's apparent, I'm a beast from the east
With my signature sound that's ill over beats
Learn from the speech that's been inaugurated
Source winner made it, fuck being underrated
Dudes get in the mood in front of the stage
Rockin' line for line like they wrote it on the page
The call and response, it's all in the prompt
So follow me and get the fuck up like Pharaohe Monch
It's what you want
And necessary in your life
I'm nice despite and every time I get it right

[Chorus]:
When we put it all together put the shit on smash
"Cats ain't built for this"
Every line is exact and Returners on the scratch
"On the two turntables"
"Show 'em what we got"
Musically we inclined, combination intertwine
"I don't fuck around dunny"
"This most real"
Never steer you wrong, every element is strong
"The game's about to change"
"Aight then"[Verse One] [El Da Sensei]:
We cop it off and blast, brag with slang editorial
Man they never called you when the loot becomes recordable
Audible pro I smash lines into winery
Locked in the booth with the neighbors is where you find me
Trippin' from days back, but now I'm futuristic
2009 still thrill with linguistics
Dwell underneath in the thick of the beat
Pick up your feet and wake you from your slumbering sleep
Pummel the weak and spit like street sweepers in broad day
Spit it the hard way like Cosby on an off day
Crazed and throw it together in a better context
Always brand new like the cat who ain't signed yet
Rhyme vet, in shape like cardio in the gym
Heartless with the pen, regardless who you send
Tim, Socks and me, together we team
Blowin' off steam, Returners you know the routine

[Chorus]
Cats wanna front on the name
"I ain't trippin'"
I'mma keep showin' up on the bill so deal with it
Heat rocks still kickin' my dude
"I ain't trippin'"
Cock back, hot raps and you know we got that

We keep a rappers feet to the flames
"I ain't trippin'"
Packin' with capacity crowds so stay flippin'
"I ain't trippin'"
"No, I'm not playin' with ya"

[Verse Two] [Ghettosocks]:
Dude, I'm not trippin', your tunes are not hittin'
The Sock spittin', clock chicks gin on the rocks sippin'
My Pulp Fiction will knock you out the box limpin'
And hot writtens, clown kids like Robot Chicken
My clique's bangin' like chip wagons packed with ?
We called your blog "Raw Dawg" and crashed the server
Enthusiasm curber, we'll smash your promo
Playin' hot potato with your head and catch a murder
After I lash out I'm sewing your eyelids
Fly shit, burn your retinas and fill up your mind quick
I call your chick Dell cause she's building a virus
That'll cast away your friends like on Gilligan's Island
Look, even your mom loves to see this kid rhyme
But when you free I actually see the stink lines
I'm three to six times, easily this big time
Cause to crush they A game I never need to bring mine

[Chorus]
We keep a rappers feet to the flames
"I ain't trippin'"
Packin' with capacity crowds so stay flippin'
"I ain't trippin'"

Cats wanna front on the name
"I ain't trippin'"
I'mma keep showin' up on the bill so deal with it
Heat rocks still kickin' my dude
"I ain't trippin'"
Cock back, hot raps and you know we got that
"No, I'm not playin' with ya"[Verse One] [Sean Price]:
Get rich quick scam
Lick dick bitch scram
Bastards to biscuits
Oh shit, flip bam!
Bam Margera
Hanna Barbera
Death metal leather jacket on Pantera
Grand era, Grand Old Oppy
Grand standin'
Evel Knievel jumped 'cross the damn Grand Canyon
Last Man Standin'
Bruce Willis step cock
Next movie off point, fuckin' Mos Def shot
Body in the truck been there for two days
So the car drive by with the boomin' human
Check in the mail like Newman
Hahaha, get it
Checkin' the male like Newman
(Yeah I got it I got it)
Duke you rappin' like Rappin Duke
The Da Ha Da Ha, bitch nigga scratch your boot
That's when the right hand froze thinkin'
"How much coke did I sniff with a ? nose"
That's more than a little bit
Calcium deprived because mommy got little tits
Down south niggas listen to Lil' Flip
Up north niggas listen to Lil' Fame
(M.O.P.)
We both listen to Lil' Wayne
We takin' your little chain

[Scratch Hook]:
"Everyday in the street" - Nas 'Nastradamus'
"Same shit different day, but still the same"
"It's most real" - G.O.D. Part III 'We Will Surive'
"In da hood"
"Everyday and all day" - A.G
"Always the same" - Gang Starr 'Discipline'

[Verse Two] [Bekay]:
I come from a place where we play off cops but the bitches fuck from free
Suck and pluck you duckin' me, get stuck and bleed, Brooklyn's ugly
Uhh, even the ad-libs stab kids
And find your body parts chopped up in a bag like spare ribs
Walkin' around like a zombie
Talk of the town, stalkin' em now
Chasin', slowly Jason, walk calmly
Brooklyn gully, lookin' ugly, pull jooks we hungry
My man got caught, the judge threw the book at money
Now he doin' 23 and 1, never see the sun
Plus he never see his son and that's fucked up
A bitter craps, spit a fact
Tough talk? Get rid of that
Your girl gave so much head we nicknamed her "fitted cap"
Dudes will hustle outside your condominium
They flip more rocks than a pissed off Palestinian
You get clapped dead if I wanna
But that ain't a mac it's just an Atari I bought off the crackhead on the corner
Brooklyn!

[Scratch Hook]:
"Everyday in the street"
"Same shit different day, but still the same"
"It's most real"
"In da hood"
"Everyday and all day"
"Always the same"

[Verse Three] [El Da Sensei]:
Niggas we movin' off the block like we pitchin' hand in hand
Slots takin' by man to man
Combat that's on demand
H.D
Hot demographics, ?
Killer beats that make me
And there's more that's given lately
So, at your service ?
Electrify like third rails and tunes that never fail
By request y'all niggas call on me
With the chemistry that's built since 1993
Lavishly I dress the rhymes to coincide
With the foremost sound, get you aroused and polarized
Now things change and the flows got sicker
Delivery's slick and the tracks are more thicker
Start where we left off
And reincarnate
The all star quota that many seen as a lost art
Sean, Bekay and me
Out of this trifeful
Songs that cause spite and shooters wanna snipe you
{gunshot}

[Scratch Hook]:
"Everyday in the street"
"Same shit different day, but still the same"
"It's most real"
"In da hood"
"Everyday and all day"
"Always the same"[Intro/Chorus 2X: Saint]
I can't act that way
Can't believe the things you say
What exactly do you want me to be?
Everything but me

[Saint]
No strings attached, be out to move my lanes
No place to stick your arm to manuever my chain
These are the shoes that I'm in and I ain't makin 'em fit
You want me in them size twos forever fakin my shit
You want it cookie cutter, less risk of takin a hit
You want a kid on his last leg just waitin to spit
You want a thug who want a deal and don't wanna be poor
You wanna hear the same notions that I wanna ignore
Sure I wanna be the one that others want to go cop
Who wouldn't want to but for that I wouldn't want to go pop
But I don't wanna be, a wannabe
I want to be the producer/MC that best represents me
You wouldn't want a person make you do the stuff he don't wanna
Wanna make me want to live by some rules I won't honor
Wanna be startin somethin like Michael, you don't want it
That old do-what-I-wanna-do type shit, I'm on it

[Chorus]

[Emskee]
People always try to push you into somethin that represents frontin
Cause the truth is not what they're really wantin
They wanna change or rearrange for spite
All because they're in position to say what's right
Whatever happened to confidence and self-expression
Of people who are talented and shouldn't be questioned?
Alter your game for a mass appeal
With a conservative feel cause it's hard to come real
Lockin you down like their slowly shield
'Til the person that they want to come out, is revealed
Some are better left behind the scenes screening
Cause being who they are, really has no meaning
Or merit to move, into the bright lone spotlights
But only those holdin power seem to have rights
Maintain your identity and passion
And don't change quick like the seasons of fashion
It's a lot easier said than done
But there's a cost if you really wanna be number one
If you really wanna be number one
There's a cost if you really wanna be number one...

[Chorus]

[El Da Sensei]
Yeah, trendsetter with a better movement
Movement to be timeless, lines showin improvement
On path with my own craft
Lone gunman that brag from now way in the past
Yeah, hard left since I started this mess
Heartbelt like car theft rock on regardless
Been a task since the flow is off beat
Told to slow down and don't put words squeezed in neat
Be yourself, show what your life's worth
MAN UP, because it's you before any colors first
Preservation over instrumentation
Rhyme over beats since beat gave creation
In the mirror I face who's responsible
And jot down heat in each and every chronicle
Unstoppable, nothing's impossible
Goals are probable, voted top model, yeah

[Chorus] - 1/2[El Da Sensei]
Yo yo yo, huh hah
Smooth diff' in this, y'all know what's going on with this right here
Yo it's Shawn J., bust it
It's goin down like that
El Da Sensei hah, for the '9-8
F.T., Mike Zoot, Prince Po' huh, Pharoahe Monch
The Frontline, huh
You don't know what's up with this, uhh uhh
You don't know what's up with this
Doing drama like dis do', yo check it out check it out

My vendetta in this form of musical song
Is to enlighten and brighten the mind through instrument and rhyme
And fix those inadequate flows that don't adapt
Makin snacks on wax plates for DJs to scratch

[Pharoahe Monch]
Fast slash, cross hatch slash, cross patch
Every word of mine will be verbally so tight to match
That or that I hit you harder than Caterpillar trucks
In the lab where we collaborate or matter will erupt

[Mike Zoot]
From a, music martyr, bust mortar, break the order
Torch your sound texture, fire water's in my aura
Your future forefather, your new wave slave wrapped in chains and amulets
And hard to earn assets

[F.T.]
Yo, niggas game playing but not name saying
My aim's sprayin, I get mine that's why you stay waitin
And vacating, whether you know it or not, I'mma blow up the spot
If you owe me a lot, I'mma show up with Glocks

[Prince Poetry]
And you're still wet, pull up your socks, suspend the art
Sizzle like woks, underground spots, from the city to the boondocks
Bounce, double wishbone suspension like shocks
Multiple plans and plots, word

[Hook - all]
You know we shine with rhymes all the time
Keep in mind don't test these MCs who bless (Word)
Test these MCs
You know we shine with rhymes all the time
Keep in mind don't test these MCs who bless (Word)
Test these MCs (Word what ugh)
Test these MCs

[El Da Sensei]
I spit fire satire, indeed bleed, phenomenal demographics
Broadcast my rhyme forecast to eager addicts
Pave a path many can't outlast
Who these cats who blast gats rehearsing lines for a movie cast?
But as a centrail, blaze the track engage
Instamatic sporadic insight pays for days
With their sickening floss, flip on tracks like Dominique Dawes
Pause, date back, flows is getting flashback

[Pharoahe Monch]
My existence, spirits in animated film
Three-dimensionally roller scoped
With cloaking devices, skates, stoges and a motor boat
I hold the Pope for ransom, it's
The handsomest, assassinating Satan
Leaving the world Marilyn Manson-less
I'm in the streets like Sesame
The recipe - to kill, attain da mil/DeMille like Cecille B
The rest'll be the aftermath, the most got statistics
Pharoahe Monch, Steve Post about to lift it

[Mike Zoot]
I gotta get mine, give it back so you can get yours

[Prince Poetry]
I gotta get mine, give it back so you can get yours

[Mike Zoot]
I gotta get mine, give it back so you can get yours
Yo yo UHH WHAT

I'm leavin your staff mated, making these crabs hate it
I lotta fags rate it and thought I got stagnated
I'm not some rap nigga that you're dying to meet
Just another hungry brother real hungry and trying to eat
And in the streets you better rely on your feet
Babies is feelin iron, crying to sleep
Plus the government is supplying the heat
They going psychotic in prison cos of the economic additions
Plus sex and drugs in the bleachers

[F.T.]
3-4 come up, run up in beefcake gun butt-ups
Crush truck chains, the wiry gold frames
Chains sums up, the dollars, white collar, blue Range
Eat my dust up, ten in the bucket in the left lane gaining momentum
Cum sending comers, fair game, a lot of sumtin sumtin
All in or nothin, silence the sufferin
Can't stand the struggling, some resume games to stain jugglin
I muscled in and scribbled my name

[Prince Poetry]
Belittle your brain, the true grain riddle your frame
Got you forfeiting the bitch by the middle of the game
Hostile, impossible to stop below the free
Buck em down, shook em nothin at the top of the key
Prince, omnipotent, magnificent moves, strategic
Smash joints, leaving the track paraplegic
Repeat it for those who need it, niggas catch the vibe
Fish 'n grits, hot sauce, forever embedded inside

Chorus

[Mike Zoot - Outro]
What, ugh, yo, yeah come on, yeah yeah
By my nigga El Da Sensei, Mike Zoot, ynahI'msayin?
Okay, F.T., Guesswhyld
I gotta fresh style[Verse One: El Da Sensei]
In my lifetime I write the rhyme bent at most times
Walk the street with iron cleats relying on beats to keep me signed
Some ghetto fab' label
Where thugs tell their fables and their drug warfare
Guerrilla combat affair
Truth or dare share similar tales
That compare to street poetry
They armed to do harm, slowly
Keep a watchful eye for stick up Tri's guys you thought was fly
Plot your downfall to reach the sky
No trust in this game, only lust jealousy plus shame
How many cats you know by their first name?
Address change, weekly fiends on arrival
Raise your right hand
Swear that you do it just for survival
Undeniable ends become vital, idle chat
Potential weaponry
No doubt, you gotta cop a gat
I've never been a player
But I never warmed the bench
Street wise resident
Never hesitant to represent

[Hook: El Da Sensei] {x2}
Hard times, hard crimes
I roam through the city that's star evidence
Street smart from the start
(How's that?)
Through my rap
(Who ya be?)
Sensei
(Where ya at?)
In The Bricks, home of the car jack

[Verse Two: El Da Sensei]
I walk the path of the wise
Ever corner's downsized
The price of shit get's high
And to all is no surprise
Make the scrabble
B.I. gets handle
All on board, baller supreme
Fuck a dollar and a dream
Entourage is large
Boss hog in charge
Bling bling, neck and wrist plus the pinky ring god
What I've just explained is your average cat
Who never lasts
Check the jail rate, peep the facts
I can go on for days, you know how the shit ends
On the run till you're caught trying to hide out with your friends
Mad niggas involved till your case gets solved
You know the game ain't the same, justice system has evolved
Three strikes no if's or mights
No court fight for spite
Three hots and a cot, same food every night
I preach my words with the force for all many souls lost
Willing to sacrifice honorable at any cost

[Hook]

[Verse Three: El Da Sensei]
Hey young world
Grimy cats, rats, boy and girls
Hard life, trife times and just one swirl
It's hard in these streets, we hear the struggle everyday
Trying to eat, make ends meet, legal or the other way
Brothers say I'm down for mine
Purchase the shine
But don't own no homes or have some kind of piece of mind
In a long line of success brothers settle for less
Trying to impress the same cat who warned you just to wear a vest

[Hook] {x2}[Intro]
Not gonna tell you who on the track, figure it out for yourself
Just know that we took a long trip
Jetlag the fuck out man

[Verse 1: El Da Sensei]
In these days and times we lay the rhyme for pay
And my hayday switch [?] any given day
Ask what's [?] in this rap game bullshit
Make you niggas feel when i comply like a bullet
Sensei young I die with the bullet style up in your grill piece
Release my rap sheet in a daily stroll
Giving out a toll you gotta pass
Before you enter my class [?] if you got the jazz

[Verse 2: Mike Zoot]
Advancing through the forefront
My line designs
The next coming, stopping, go
I keep something more live
Driving new nikes ten [?]
Silver [?] aerodynamic design
Switching to timbs like new rims
Sliding out superfly
Holding my two-seat neat
And all you bitches want to ride
You'll never take my pride
Niggas die so I can get money
Lounging living lovely
Lounging living lovely

[Hook] x2
We're on point
International connects
[?] Tommy Tee next on deck
We're on point
International connects
Mike Zoot, El Da Sen maintain the cash checks

[Verse 3: El Da Sensei]
The originator prominence dominating the [?]
When I gather with my peoples we lead through long instruments
And get paragraphs with ease to show my proper steez
All city actual natural talent I be

[?] proper technique to use
Ah see, my shit is like ebony-ivory

Stuck on stupidness, yes it's fresh

Turning whole tables, lay [?] in coffins
Spitting, stay talking, rocking the awkward stance
Glancing at your [?] benz

Tight pans with (?) young girl [?]

Catching honeys like [?]

[Hook] x2"There's one life to live, so live it the best you can" - Nas 'Classic'

[Verse One]:
All aboard this is for the hardcore
Flossin', uninsured, uninspired coke jaw
Many tales of that
Goin' through the madness
Yester year is fear, speak of days when we had this
Shit, locked and sewn, before the Patron
It was easier to get on with the skills and the song
Now, don't get me wrong I got my tales too
But since I first started my job was not to fail you
But nowadays your best rappers can't get deals
Albums don't drop, that's when shit is real
Warning signs flash and your life does too
For the rent you gotta scramble just to make due
With no bookin' agent, you'll have to go for self
Tours and features, put some shit on the shelf
Merch table, turntable to please your fan base
To continue motivation, not comin' in last place

[Hook]:
And it's the life it is
We all got one life to live
"You never succeed or progress
Searchin' for peace through material objects" - I.N.I. 'Fakin' Jax'
"And you know what?"
It's the life it is
We all got one life to live
"It's one life to live" - Nas 'Classic'
"In this life" - Gang Starr 'In This Life'
"It's war, I want it all man, nothings enough" - Inspectah Deck 'The Raw'

[Verse Two]:
The younger audience is foolish when they breakin' the rules
Disrespectful to the laws that we learned from school
Peers and their elders, appear to be in shambles
Careers they can't handle, even with new samples
It's steady dying down and it's gettin' dumber
Many now wonder why artists been losing numbers
Supply and demand is no longer the disc
Cause now the ringtone exists and replace what you missed
Now it's all digitized
Streamlined, even podcasts
More publishin' for Internet cash
Small dudes think it all about the ignorant and rude
Gun talk, tough shit, tryin' to eat your food
And new ways of beats disguised by Pro Tools
And Fruity Loops, but the soul has no proof
Of being hot my nigga
So sign for readmitting time
From a school of writtens and I'm givin' free admission

[Hook]:
And it's the life it is
We all got one life to live
"You never succeed or progress
Searchin' for peace through material objects"
"And you know what?"
It's the life it is
We all got one life to live
"It's one life to live"
"In this life"
"It's war, I want it all man, nothings enough"

[Verse Three]:
What is the outcome?
Who has the resolution?
Searchin' for retribution
To start a revolution
Many think it's unfair and they can't bare
To hear the bullshit they servin' on the air
Never compare these times with the shit that leaked
Most people agree, so we propose sequels
To keep it in tact while other acts ruin it
Pleasure to the ear when the writers are reviewin' it
Publicity and other intricacies
And most noted through the industry when shit is promoted
DVDs and a host of compilation CDs
Of "Best Of" for a buzz when you're in it like me
An extra edge and we all got priors
Past record deals and I still got buyers
This could be you if you're showin' longevity
Follow my melody and you'll be steps ahead of me

[Hook]:
And it's the life it is
We all got one life to live
"You never succeed or progress
Searchin' for peace through material objects"
"And you know what?"
It's the life it is
We all got one life to live
"It's one life to live"
"In this life"
"It's war, I want it all man, nothings enough"[Verse One] [Reef The Lost Cauze]:
I gotta eat homie, I gotta make bread
This is America, shit look at K-Fed
Anyone with a dollar and dream can pocket cream
Sit and think of possible schemes
When I was young I had a paper route
I was a paper boy
20 years later haters, still countin' paper boy
Money talks so trust me, I'm makin' noise
People turn to slaves like Rich Pryor when he played The Toy
For that fast dollar, it take a lot of work
I'm on an island, water bluer than Papa Smurf
Bein' broke and bummy man, it's gotta hurt
I'm tryin' to cop a Benz before I cop a hearse
You can die for it
You will lie for it
Money make a bitch get on her knees and cry for it
We don't have the same vice as the rich
Cause without money homeboy your life is just shit
And that's real

[Scratch Hook]:
"Money make the world go round"
"Money on my mind"

"All 4 The Cash" - Gang Starr
"The money, money"
"Money make the world go round"
"Money on my mind"
"Nowadays"
"All 4 The Cash"
"The money, money"

[Verse Two] [El Da Sensei]:
Loot the root of all evil
Seen it dissolve people
And curse the feeble and the needy and the non equal
They ever paper chase green backs for luxury
Lavish lifestyle on a low budget fee
Some cats grind illegally and some straight
Most scrape to fill ends across lines, interstate
Unemployment leads to no enjoyment
Constant suffering from hard times spent
On the scramble, stick ups become casual
Unnatural thoughts for cream to make gradual
Tools bang steady for the come up and the cash out
Dice game, leave the dealer, Posse wanna Mash Out
Legal tender costs friends to enemies
Lady friends whisper "please", strictly on bent knees
Family never blends when they ask him for cheese
ATM receipts steady fallin' out my sleeves
It's like

[Scratch Hook]:
"Money make the world go round"
"Money on my mind"
"Nowadays" - Mr. Lif
"All 4 The Cash" - Gang Starr
"The money, money"
"Money make the world go round"
"Money on my mind"
"Nowadays"
"All 4 The Cash"
"The money, money"

[Verse Three] [Roc Marciano]:
I buy a pound or a brink on counterfeit
Keep powder to flip, push weight like a power lift
House shit
Two chains in the outfit
Outwit
Plug you with a gun like an outlet
Turn your town to the wild west
And count bread
? flow out the shower head
I'm just a con man nigga
Dollar flipper
White collar, killer
Common script I'll starve and pimp her
Put her out there and tell them tricks to park they Sentras
And our agenda is the larger tender
You're not hard to injure I'll part and bend ya
Gosh loves and the target interpardon the clip
Look like a cigar dispenser
Chandon pour it all on the whiskers
Come whisper when you see the larger picture
Nigga

[Scratch Hook]:
"Money make the world go round"

Yeah, Yeah
Here we go
Jersey stand up
A 7 Heads presentation
El Da Sensei
All y'all just relax
Sit back, take a drink
1,2

[Verse 1]
Yo, take a step inside the booth
With no BET films documentin' the proof
No twangs in my slang cause I come from the east
Known for heatin' hot-ass beats and bullets from the beast
I'm just one of many and I'm here to unleash
My presentation as a piece of myself to eat
7 Heads is the label and I rep that shit
Musical magic, fantastic, on the average
My rendition of the classics, rendition of the last true and livin'
But alas my edition on arrival
Logical, melodical
Trying to get the fans and more cash and respect that's possible
Straight up, I got the early 90's flow
Slam upon tracks like Booker T on Monday Nitro
You fiend for my taste like puttin' fingers in the cake mix
Rock off kicks and harmonize like Take 6

[Hook] Repeat 2x
Relax, think
Back, when shit was fat
Relax, Relate, Remember
Not long ago when we all knew what was the agenda

Debate this in any presidential candidate
I spit great from the BX to the Great Lakes
Dedicate this to my dad who past
And to all my late relatives from years past
To my son: God Bless, you relieve my stress
Keep me striving for the best in this industry mess
It's true to the fact that I'm not like ya'll
Cause we Tom Hill Billy niggas tryin' to ball
"What happened to the sound?" what everbody's askin'
Guns clappin', top emcees clashin'
Well fuck that, real tracks at your service
No need to get nervous as you get into the verses
Natural exceptional... enough about myself
If it ain't about myself, then it ain't nothin' else
So Relax is the title, El Da Sen' online
Mark off your favorite joints then press rewind

[Hook] Repeat 2x
Relax, think
Back, when shit was fat
Relax, Relate, Remember
Not long ago when we all knew what was the agenda

[Outro]
Like I said before
El Da Sensei
Relax everybody
I got you
Just sit back
Enjoy the music
Just remember when we was doin' everything in the 90's
And the 80's
Yeah, yeah...[Verse One]
As I recall it
I first started to only get dap
To show the cats on my block and in my school that I could rap
They knew me as a B-Boy
Now I burst a verse and added piece to my collection
Twice that for the selection
I chose this direction cause I was an expert
At not only art, plus I had the ill footwork
Dancing supreme, flares, crabs, slice and windmill
Twelve years was the age, by then I had the will
I knew deep in my heart that if I came up with a scheme
To use my tools and my skills I'd fulfill my rap dreams
Started copping LP's as the years went by
Noticing the different styles and how MC's sound fly
P.E., J.B.'s, Rakim, Red Alert
KRS, Marley Marl, Juice Crew and B.L.S
The state of fresh plus a mess inbetween
That makes up my whole aura as an MC fiend

[Scratch Hook]
"Don't think you can before you start rapping" - Fat Joe
Labels, A&R, marketing schemes
"Don't think you can before you start rapping"
Looking at contracts and don't know what it mean
"Don't think you can before you start rapping"
Per diem, promo shows worth no doe
"Don't think you can before you start rapping"
This is what happens in the game but you just don't know

[Verse Two]
To get my props as a pro I entered local talent shows
Cause I knew without my lessons my profession wouldn't grow
Battle cats in my school, in the street or in the club
Made a name for myself, everybody showed me love
But there was still something missing from my flavor of the month
So I sold out for a partner that was ill from the jump
Enter Tame One, lyric extrodinar
Two superb legionar, niggas couldn't compare
Slaying cats left and right, who performing tonight?
(That's them!)
Damn right, known to always be nice
Count was minimal but we didn't gain respect
Till 89.9, Bob and Armstrong Stretch
Official to the world or shall I say the industry
Now we hit from Dirty Jers' with the shit for NYC
Cause where we at, Jersey already on the map
So we uphold tradition so enters Artifacts

[Scratch Hook]
"Don't think you can before you start rapping"
Executives in your ear telling you, you the shit
"Don't think you can before you start rapping"
Until your album comes out and there's nobody buying it
"Don't think you can before you start rapping"
Check the soundscan, [?] to see your flow
"Don't think you can before you start rapping"
This is what happens in the game but you just don't know

[Verse Three]
Aight, the year is '94 and we signed a record deal, put your boots on
Big Beat/Atlantic was the shield
On the real, the first album was a dope experience
Hear my voice on wax over T-Ray instruments
Hitting tours and all
From a song talking 'bout writing on the wall
Many thought we had balls
We knew it was the plan, laid the whole program
Between A Rock And Hard Place, the label didn't understand
Example yo, my nigga listen to this
We would've blown from a vid' off the Busta remix
Second album mad pressure but we did that shit
Came with The Ultimate, a plaque, one tour, we split
Now the whole world shaking cause they knew that we was breaking
No more cans to be shaking, know the scores that we was lacing
From this I took a two year break and I was back
Cause I can't be stopped from getting mine, fuck that

[Hook]
"Don't think you can before you start rapping"
How it affects your life and how those around you feel your strife
"Don't think you can before you start rapping"
Whether you like it or not, the hottest MC can get dropped
"Don't think you can before you start rapping"
Keep your day job, messing with this you get robbed
"Don't think you can before you start rapping"
This is what happens in the game but you just don't know
"Don't think you can before you start rapping"[Verse 1]
Now, once more and I'm back again
No misconceptions, connections, fuck the resurrections
Not here to hate or be a thug or...
Just bust hot-ass, raw rhymes that's in my nature
This goes out to dancers, b-boys, and boosters
Stick-up kids, and dice shooters
Manoeuvre slick when I talk shit
Walk with a bop, brandin' the hottest transcript
Fuck what your man did
These days I go for self
Cause I learned one deal ain't a seal for help
So I rely on my skill and writin' abilities
Magnify all my talents and circular quality
Music for chicks who like it simple
And still think for critics on the streets
Who bang it just for beats
Harness - that hazardous, well-crafted word play
Gone is - the fabulous style cast from Jersey
Wanted - all over the world from circumstances
Outlandish, contagious and demanded
Monitor the format, all signed and sealed
World-class appeal, whup that ass for real
Known as the Ill Speaker from the East
I'm here to step it up a notch, Kaos my nigga, speak

*Kaos scratches*
(The infamous)
(Lyrical terrorist)
(I drop the truth)
(Exclusive from the Bricks)
(I'm the master)
(From the Bricks)

[Verse 2]
Young cats of today only think about dreams
Of ice, bitches, and CREAM and all the drama it bring
But I won't speak upon that, I've got a album to do
All y'all magazine writers prepare for your review
I kick that shit to make you feel relieved
Feel release from the toungue-in-cheek athlete complete
With a colorful outlook, advanced rhyme book
It took mad time perfecting my lines and hooks
For your liking I'm strikin', official rhyme-writin'
All mine and clean, nigga, and never bitin'
The most favorite emcee in your life
Like famous black role models cause I always come right
Catch his ass at nine while my flash has the shine
On the rise mastermind, blast like landmines
I come from a time when the sound was paved
To stay new and creative in this hip-hop place

*Kaos scratches*

[Verse 3]
I institutionalize fans, take 'em to a land unheard of
To serve up, take it a step further
Here to take charge and show y'all what the plan is
Here to show y'all the ways and who the man is
Soul searchin' with stripes that show experience
Passport stamps will show you my gate clearance
Backpackers' support and mainstream fame
I'm 'bout to change the whole game and still stay the same
Planes from the proclaimed master of the flow
Whether wardrobe drippin' with colors or mad low
It's natural how the casual man can grab you
Like John Randall, frauds, I can't stand you!
I never claim to be the best at this
Style priceless, better with my lip service
J. Rawls on the track and you know who I be
Dedicated to the fans and all who's worthy

*Kaos scratches*Yo, yo, yo, check it
I make the past dash for the post to most indeed
My dough speeds approve feed, what I believe top seed
I write scrolls like Judei Sensei, my tongue real sharp
On the target shit, that your mind can't shield
Most can't feel, the appeal I set upon the mass
Niggas speakin ?, one point seven grams of vocal hash
I splash like Hank and Bank flows in many waters
Shamed your game even before the fourth quarter
My order is brief, I chant meaning for demeanor
With my cleaner outlook, my moves advancin like a rook
Took, time to design, but I incline, intertwine my
Shit upon your mind, check, for my warnin signs cause
I'm a hazardous graduate of the schools of fatness
My inner flows like, water in a cactus
But y'all can't see the science in this - I'm like
The day you bought you first LP, from Kane or Blastmaster Kris
Twist trees, the ordinary nig would never toke
Well over here we catch a tree but overseas we catch a boat
I wrote these degrees for the backpacks, travellin on foot
The low Guess sag, Walkman and a notebook
And Goddesses with their ear to the norm
Cause the new generation got this whole shit wrong..

Who's the fool?  My tools only used to bring elaborate
Shit on ?, activist servin my addicts (why?)
Fuck up those who dance by chance a champ be fly
Smack that ass that go by and she won't ask me why
I'm tokin never gun totin I'm potent with the word spoken
Leak the speak nigga, pass that, you're chokin
With a minimum dose, toast for taste, for your liking in advance
Enhance thoughts so, comp take a chance
In my world, only the true stand in my circumfrence
They're bumpin shit, with lyrics so much they're mad abundence
I'm like the first Dutch of your day, Sensai
I'm rallyin carry the load, as my pen explode
My tech shows no weakness, behold my uniqueness
Daily Rap News messenger, Under Pressure
I raise the stakes on fakes like chips to, a gambler
You're catchin my phrase like, I passed to Wes Chandler
My style not the R&B code, but the true category
Concoting flows in Dexter's Laboratory
Switching up styles like teams of Robert Horry
It'll take me days to tell my tales of fame and glory
Been down long roads leadin through, the Swiss Alps
Where every chick in town got blonde hair in they scalp
What I'm about, is still refreshin your mind, guys are blind
Cause what you find is the shit, is the downfall of rapkind
Askin the same question, all the time whassup with yo' shit?
Yo sit back and focus, beginners notice:
My speech is never an impediment
Always a step of it to show I have intelligence
So, MC El Da Sensei, O-U-T
For the nine-eight season we be, out..[Verse One]
Wake up to the alarm, about five in the morn'
Crack of dawn and I'm yawning but the show goes on
Packed my bags last night cause we catching a flight
To a town near you just to rock the mic
Hitting Kaos on the line, making sure he's awake
He called me at the same time, "Yo, you ready to skate?"
"Hell yeah." Take a stretch then
Hit up West and Lamont for the info, scramble for a pencil
And jot down airports, airline, air time
E ticket, no standing in line
Get dressed grab my passport, I'm ready to step
Meet my crew at the gate to blow your sound set

The rest of our flight cause I'm not ready to die yet
Jet across the stream no matter the team
Better rhyme schemes and brown to keep the sound clean
Stewardess hit me with a bag of nuts and a Coke half cup
And 'gnac to ease me up
I'm all good, but I'm kinda nervous and tense
Cause of today's events and this damn turbulence
Stomach wilding out from that entree, fake ass filet
Plus this kid is making noise the whole way
Before you knew it, yo we almost there
Swooping down in your city, spread love in the air
Exit the main gate then I look for a sign

These three niggas past due, smash, slash on avenues
With compatible tapes fine tune to battle fakes
See I'm, verbally put, crushing my [?]
I'm off the books with my no look pass, I slash crooks

[Asheru]
It's a jooks
El Da Sen' hit me with the alley oop
Above the rim plus I make you dream hoops
Over loops that's more like nightmares
I'm right here first off the line
Niggas crying, "He don't fight fair"

[J-Live]
Fair fight, yeah right
How you gonna fight fair son?
One on one you out numbered in the battle of wits
And outmatched in the war of the words
You won't get shit but diss, dismissed and disturbed

[El Da Sensei]
Word superb be the grandest
Rap band this
Vandalize your snipes if we really can't stand it
Smack niggas open handed for spite
Without a thirst for Sprite, ignite flames upon the mic

[Asheru]
And like a beacon of light you see the god shining
In the heat of the night, on stage or showtime
I've been seasoned to fight, you get knocked the fuck out
Stop talking out the side of your head, use your mouth

[J-Live]
Better yet, use inside of your head, just stop talking
And keep listening until your ears glistening
The last dragon fashion, without the jheri curl goo
Catch the bullet in your teeth then chew like

[Hook: El Da Sensei]
Fellas, tell me now what you wan' do?
Ladies, tell me now what you wan' do
All y'all in the back, yo what ya wan' do?
All my people in the front, yo what you wan' do?
Smoke! Tell me now what you wan' do?
Wild out! Tell me now what you wan' do?
Listen up, all my people in the front to back
Seven Heads be the crew, now what you wan' do?

[Verse Two: Asheru]
I wanna spit rhymes Starbucks style, you know venti
You few and far between my flow, good and plenty
It's Ash' from the way beyond, guess who sent me
Some niggas that you ain't fucking with, evidently
It's elementary, Unspoken is the name brand
Seven Heads who mastered the game plan
You heard how we, roll together like herb and spliffs
The wordsmiths of the empire, never tired state
Inspired, turn styles like NYC transit state
On the road, the family demands it
Whether I'm rolling with Blue or single handed
The crowd gets commanded till they can't stand it

[J-Live]
Word
Sit your ass down before you get branded
Matter of fact, put your mic back in the stand kid
Or else get your arm chopped off like Skywalk'
And we put you in the crowd to clap with one hand shit
Better off doing what Ash' just demanded
Even if it don't go down as you planned it
Dope shit recognize, dope shit recognize
How I just said it two times like Duran did
Just to get y'all to understand it
Better when rehearsed but just as hot candid
Bet you wack rappers up on the CD
When I finish the verse they say, "The eagle has landed"

[Hook: El Da Sensei]
Fellas, tell me now what you wan' do?
Ladies, tell me now what you wan' do
All y'all in the back, yo what ya wan' do?
All my people in the front, yo what you wan' do?
Drink! Tell me now what you wan' do?
Bang out! Tell me now what you wan' do?
Hold up, all my people in the front to back
Seven Heads be the crew, now what you wan' do?

[Verse Three: El Da Sensei]
We all click like drum sticks
Top gunner who run with
A crew of skilled writers who thrill crowds of hundreds
Thoughts relentless, keeping ya interest
With splendid music, vintage to the finish
I'm all purpose with the service to black
Push your wig back further cause we murder the track
Grab my ball to signify that we drop jewels
When we build foundations off a sound tools
Judge to council I rest my case
There ain't another MC trying to take my place
Manipulate bars and such, hard to touch
Cross up on a player trying to guard the clutch
Giving a fuck about what I put on the street
Cause you can't compete without rhymes and ill beats
This one goes out to non believers who sleep
Just a brief conversation of the shit complete

[Hook: El Da Sensei]
Fellas, tell me now what you wan' do?
Ladies, tell me now what you wan' do
All y'all in the back, yo what ya wan' do?
All my people in the front, yo what you wan' do?
Bricks! Tell me now what you wan' do?
DC! Tell me now what you wan' do?
Brooklyn! All my people in the front to back
Seven Heads be the crew, now what you wan' do?
