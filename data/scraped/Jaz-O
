[Intro: Kay Slay]
G-Force (what's up Slay?)
I need you to make a hit for me (talk to me)
Four suspects (who?)
Busta Rhymes, Layzie Bone (who else?)
Twista, Jaz-O (I got ya)
There they go, take the shot!
Take the shot! DAMN!

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
When I come and I hop and I skip and I rhyme
And I dumb and I drop and I spit and I shine
Ay-ay-ay nigga what you really wanna do?
You ain't knowin that I'm comin to take what's mine
Every time I come to hit'cha
With a little bit of killa
Better know that you can never
Never see me little nigga
While I'm at the TOP
I will never STOP
When a nigga POP
See the way I run it, and leave a nigga bitter
Y'all know when I do my thing and I bang
Bidi-boom with a bomb and a BING!
Everybody know that when it comes to the shit I gotta spit
Motherfucker better crown me KING!
With a passion and a lot of action
See the way ya grab 'em, HOW YOU DO IT!
Then they wanna ask him
How a nigga smash 'em
See the way ya have 'em, DRAG 'EM TO IT!
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey-HEY!
Now you gotta know what a nigga do all day
Count bread make a nigga wanna bounce heads when I drop heat in these streets, okay?
You shitty with a get'cha gimmick
And I hope a lot of niggas live near a clinic
It don't really matter who you wanna ask about me
Cause I be the fiercest with it
While I'm givin you the final chapter
With a lot of laughter
See the way I capture
Everybody probably tellin you the same shit you don't really wanna come after!
Now I suggest you listen whenever you hear that the beat up in the buildin
Trust me, this is not the place for you to bring yo' children

[Verse 2: Layzie Bone]
The B-O-N-E we got plenty of flows;
From Cleveland, Ohio we rollin on vogues
They told me this record was only for pros
So Layzie gon' get in M.V.P. I suppose
Foes slammin them Cadillac do's
My story they caught has never been told
Sit back while I'm tellin this thuggish we blaze
Forever I'm young and'll never get old
Poppin a bottle of Ros√© when I rolls
Smell the aroma, just follow your nose
We thug on the corner from night 'til the sun up
You run up get done up, I'll let it explode
Blow only where gangstas roll, so
Homie we smash around and we crash collide
Whoever don't wanna be foes, oh
O.G. status, still got money up under the mattress
Nigga come get it I'll stick like cactus,
Money so tall those niggas need ladders
Try to come close but they never could match us
So catch us, we the masters
Y'all already know how we do it on the Clair
Never compare we livin' on stretchers
Willin to bet ya, when I twist and bust
Nigga come through with Twist and Bust
Nigga been famous they know to aim it
They spittin my languange, "Adrenaline Rush"
Feminine niggas that been on a rush
Back to the dust we winnin the clutch
Just slipped through to spit some real thug shit!

[Verse 3: Twista]
Now I be the coldest on the island, country or on the peninsula
Hit them with the venom and then I'mma
Disintegrate 'em or fade 'em, fuck 'em cause I hate 'em,
I'm hot if you not check the temperature
Mayday one Kay Slay, drop the bomb on 'em when they put me on the track and I'mma
Show 'em who was out when I make 'em go and commit suicide dressed like a Phantom or
Do and I'm about to get dinner
I'm about to open the do'
Cause I'm dope with the flow
Never know how flow was the 'dro
I'mma eat a bitch up and I hope for some mo'
So long is the poem, I'm never a ho
You can go check the portfolio
Kay Slay 'em just after fuck at you and then I'mma stick 'em, you know we can go
I'm cold so go get your coat
This be the season for niggas that's sneezin and snoozin
And if you keep testin me you gon' be catchin a beatin and bruisin - what's up?
Look at the mojo and look at the swag, and look at all the vernacular
Things I be doin cause I'mma stay infamous so they be callin me Dracula
Oops I mean Blackula when I'm attackin ya
Pullin up on 'em up in the new Acura
Or new pre-Camaro or new super Lego with the Pinot Grigio seats
I see when you niggas be hatin, so the next time when you see me don't speak
Now you know not to send me no beat
Cause I'mma kill it
And murder anybody That'll wanna get it
Where they wanna get up in it cause I be the realest
I'm a menace all the way up to the finish
Make an enemy diminish
When I get up in the battle even if it gotta be on the block
2010 hip-hop, the shit don't stop

[Layzie Bone]
Just slipped through to spit some real thug shit!

[Verse 4: Jaz-O]
What can it be?
Rappers and thuggin on beats
None of 'em keepin it street
Look at them calves, all of them wanna be bulls
None of 'em ready for beef
What about me?
Been through the pain
Sorted the lames, keep it the same
Skillful syllables kill
My rhymin technique is impeccable still
Anybody ever wanna run up
Will get done up in a hurry
Got a flurry
I'mma hunt 'em for the come up
With a bang you better run from the one until you permanently feel it
I will live it, idiots gettin it
"The Originator," gotta keep it greater
Keep the fader for the haters
Nigga real for real
The all-time thriller, ready rockin the death of it definite
On it cookin and cheffin it (ooh!)
Takin over the world
Made of with your girl
Motherfucker recognize the nigga Hugh Heff'in it
Doin what you never did at double time, triple shot president
Ain't nobody better in the residence
Cream of the crop, seein' it stop
Over the top, bringin the soul makin it pop
Got a old school banger make you do the wop
Got a Louisville slugger make you diddy-bop
Ever incredible gotta keep it way ahead of you
Screamin at my niggas in the clink doin federal
No trip, no travesty
I call the lick now I'm up like anti-gravity
Spit words from the brain like charity
If hip-hop was a broad she'd marry me
Gotta keep it gutter, gotta get the bread, gotta get the butter
Make it hot, you can toast word to mother

[Layzie Bone]
Just slipped through to spit some real thug shit![Verse 1: Jay-Z]
I keep it fresher than the next, bitch
No need for you to ever sweat the next bitch
With speed, I make the best bitch see the exit indeed
You gotta know you're thoroughly respected by me
You get the keys to the Lexus, with no driver
You got your own '96 something to ride
And keep your ass tight up in Versace, that's why
You gotta watch your friends you got to watch me
They conniving, shit, the first chance to crack the bank
They try me, all they get is 50 cent franks
And papayas, from the village to the telly
Time to kill it on your belly no question
I got more black chicks between my sheets than Essence
They say sex is a weapon, so when I shoot
Meet your death in less than 8 seconds
Still pounding in my after life
Laughing, my shit is tight
Who you asking right

[Hook: Foxy Brown & (Jaz-O) with {Jay-Z}]
Ain't no nigga like the one I got
(No one can fuck you better)
Sleeps around but he gives me a lot
(Keeps you in diamonds and leathers)
Friends will tell me I should leave you alone
{Hah hah, hah hah, hah hah, hah hah}
(Tell the freaks to find a man of their own
Man of their own, man of their own)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Fresh to death in Moschino coach bag
Looking half black and Filipino faking no jacks
Got you a beeper to feel important
Surrounding your feet in Joan & David and Charles Jourdan
I keep you dove but love
You know these hoes be making me weak
Y'all knows how it goes b and so I creep
I've been sinning since you been playing with Barbie and Ken and
You can't change a players game in the 9th inning
The chrome rim spinning keeps them grinning
So I run way the fuck up in them
And wrinkle the face like linen
I play hard until they say "God
He's keeping it real Jigga stay hard"
Lord, don't even trip
I never slip, nigga, get a grip
What you don't see is what you get
Weapons concealed what the fuck y'all feel
When you niggas play sick we can all get ill
What the deal? (Foxy Brown)

[Hook]

[Jay-Z]
Yo, ain't no stopping this, no lie
Promise to stay monogamous, I try
But love you know these ho's be making me weak
Y'all know how it goes B so I stay deep

[Verse 3: Foxy Brown]
What up boo just keep me laced in the illest snakes
Bank rolls and shit, back rubs in the french tubs
Macking this bitch, wifee nigga
So when you flip that coke
Remember the days you was dead broke
But now you style and I raised you
Basically made you into a don
Flipping weight, heroin and shit
You know the pussy is all that
That's why I get baguettes, 5 carats and all that
From Dolce Gabana to H Bendel I'm ringing bells
So who the player, I still keep you in the illest gators
Tailor made so we can lay up in the shade reminiscing
On how I fuck the best and shit
Especially when I'm sipping Baileys
Don't give a fuck about how you move with them other mamis
I push the Z, eating shrimp scampi with rocks larger than life
Fuck them Reebok broads, you made it known who your wife was
I got you fronting in Armani sweaters, before this rap shit
When you was in leathers and bullshit berettas
And E classes with Mo in the glasses
Shows in Cali with all the flavor suede Bally's
Now all your mens is up in your Benz's
High post, I swear you be killing me
Playing inside my pubic hairs
I never worry about them other chicks
Cause you proved who was your wiz
When you was spending that bitch
I took a little when you was up north
Your commissary stay piling
How you living large on the island
All them collects have me vexed
But when you come home
Knew I was coming off with half of them checks
Now we on the rise
Your diamond mami with the slanted eyes
Holding this grip cocked the En Glee-Kay and shit
Fucks no, I see half of that dough
Made you into a star, pushing hundred thousand dollar cars

[Hook][Intro: Sauce Money]
Ayo, Jay, word up. These mothafuckas fucking talking that comeback shit like they cooking crack. Shit, I ain't fronting, all I want my pockets green like slum change, you know what I'm saying? Front the roll we roll back like rubbers, mothafucka, for real, with no trace of age. We keep our pockets fully blown, Roc-A-Fella clique, nigga

[Verse 1: Sauce Money]
We patting down pussy from Sugarhill to the Shark Bar
Fuck a bitch D in the marked car
We got the bad bitches gasping for air in Aspen
Searching for Aspirin when I ascend, we swing
You cling we do our thing and bring
Slinging your ding-a-ling from Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn to Beijing
East coast host is hostile colossal
Money flaring like nostrils for drug dealing apostles
Al Pacino down to Nino Brown
Me, Jay and Primo, got it sewed across the board like Poquino
Teflon, make sure your jammy is full
Cause I heard, Sammy the Bull lamps in Miami with pull
Tropical leaves where I got a few keys
With my man I'll stock a few G's, now it's unstoppable cheese
Said we was garbage, so fuck college
Street knowledge amazing to scholars when we coin phrases for dollars
Star studded bitches with crystals
Get fucked with pistols, just to see my shit, discharge puss
I drop the stellar, even acapella
I got to tell all about Roc-A-Fella

[Hook: Fat Joe]
Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Mannerisms of a young Bobby DeNiro, spent Spanish wisdoms
In a whip with dinero, crime organized like the Pharoahe
I CREAM, I diamond gleam
High post like Hakeem, got a lot of things to drop
Brooklyn to Queens, I gotta keep my steam
Niggas wanna try to hem my long jeans
Uptown fiend for Jay-Z to appear on the scene
In the meanwhile, here's something dope for y'all to lean
Liaison for days on in
Money make the world go around so I made some to spend
Can I live, did dough with my nigs
Dividends flow like the Mississippi Riv' looking jig
Can't do for dolo, had to turn away when Tony killed Manolo
That's real, mixed feelings like a mulatto
Thug thought he was O.G. Bobby Johnson
I played him like Benny Blanco, mano a mano
You ain't ready, I fire no trigger straight up, shoot my guns horizontal
Get your weight up, I am
Two point two pounds, you're barely a hundred and 25 grams
Wouldn't expect y'all to understand this money
Do the knowledge, due to few dollars, I'm due to demolish
Crews Brooklyn through Hollis to a hood near you, what the fuck?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Jaz]
Money is power, I'm energetic with facial credit
Pure platinum fetish for cheddars
Spread lettuce heroes get deadish
I make moves that remove pebbles out of shoes
You suck pistol like pipe with the crystal
John Stockton couldn't assist you
Convoys of Benzes like we fouling in the U.N
So what the fuck you doing? Whatever, nigga
Fahrvegnugen, rugged yet polished
Spanking dollars with the commas
Banging bitches out the Bahamas
On hides of llama we cry nada, fly farther
Fry hotter, you die gotta, fuck with me witness ma√±ana
Absence of malice in my palace
Call cousin now Dallas trigger finger with the callus
Tip scales from mail to keep these niggas off balance
Your frequent stops to O.T.B. you feeding me
Steam a nigga scheming on the wrist action with the gleams
Jewels for Pop Duke fulfill your dreams
Never put the pure brown sugar before the dirty green cream

[Hook][Refrain]
Nigga what, nigga who
Nigga what, nigga who
Switcha flow, getcha dough
Can't fuck with this Roc-a-Fella shit doe
Switcha flow, getcha dough
Can't fuck with this Roc-a-Fella shit doe

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Motherfuckers wanna act loco
Hit em with numerous
Shots with the fo'-fo'
Faggots wanna talk to po-po's
Smoke em like cocoa
Fuck rap, coke by the boatload
Fuck that on the run-by, gun high, one eye closed
Left holes through some guy clothes
Stop your bullshit
Glock with the full clip
Motherfuckers better duck when the fool spit
One shot could make a nigga do a full flip
See the nigga laying shocked when the bullet hit
Oh hey ma, how you know niggas wanna buy you
But see me I wanna fuck for free like Akinyele
Take this ride, make you feel it inside your belly
If it's tight get the K-Y Jelly
All night get you wide up inside the telly
Side to side, til you say Jay Z you're too much for me

[Hook]

(Nigga what?) Make you think you can fuck with me
(Nigga who?) Recognize girl, Jay to the Z
(Nigga what?) Make you think you can fuck with me
(Nigga who?) Recognize girl, Jay to the Z
(Nigga what?) Make you think you can fuck with me
(Nigga who?) Recognize girl, Jay to the Z
(Nigga what?) Make you think you can fuck with me
(Nigga who?) Recognize bitch, Jay to the motherfuckin' Z

[Verse 2]
Got a condo with nothing but condoms in it
The same place where the rhymes is invented
So all I do is rap and sex imagine how I stroke
See how I was flowing on my last cassette
Rapid-fire like I'm blasting a Tec, never jam though
Never get hot, never run out of ammo
Niggas hating and shit cause I slayed your bitch
You know your favorite, I know it made you sick
And now you're, acting raw but you never had war
Don't know how to carry your ho, wanna marry your ho
Now she's mad at me cause Your Majesty
Just happened to be a pimp - what a tragedy
She wanted, us to end cause I fucked her friends
She gave me one more chance and I fucked her again
I seen her tears as she busted in
I said shit
There's a draft
Shut the door bitch and come on in

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Got a vendetta even though I been better
Left him in the cold with a thin sweater
Rap niggas on Prozac get the bozack, niggas threw
Two at me I threw fo' back, hold that
Let the dough stack
Way before Big had the gold Ac
Dame had the Lex black
Motherfuckers wanna test that, stress that
And right where you're stressed at, where you rest at
I suggest that niggas invest in a vest when I come through
With the Glock jet black you niggas step back
I'm the best at you know I ain't no apprentice to this
Me and my niggas we invented the shit
I came into the business with this
The Originator, none greater
Jaz-O finish this shit

[Verse 4 - Big Jaz]
Better learn
Jaz'll relax that, ever heard of me
Worldwide Originator say word to me
The population holla certainly
I burn a nigga like a third degree
See me shine so bright
Nigga I'm my light, running ruling with rigor and vigor
Nobody bigger than me and my nigga Jigga
You fly-by-nights stop chirpin B
Heavyweight's light work for me
For the time in this motherfucker ain't nobody hurting me
What, cut your face in like surgery
Who the fuck got a VS
Fucking BM's on the road
When you had to be in bed at the PM
Need the info, Jaz on the C-N-N
Forever touching my work is beginning you‚Äôre endin
Nigga your style's no style my style's hostile
C'mon, faggot nigga down to take the gun home
The O-RI-GI-NA-TOR
Can't fuck with it can you

[Hook]

[Refrain x3]
Switcha flow, getcha dough
Can't fuck with this Roc-a-Fella shit doe
Switcha flow, getcha dough
Can't fuck with this Roc-a-Fella shit doe[Jay-Z]
It's the thought of a ride that make my eyes wide, I'm caught up
I'm trying to make, all of my dreams materialize, so I sorta
Say my goodbyes to the straight and narrow
I found a new route, you bout to see my life change
I make the means justify the ends, I make the cream
Materialize keys to a Benz, and so I'm rollin
For now, holdin down the fort, who's controllin?
The ground's gotta blow em, yep, y'all shoulda told em
Uhh, my first felony's approachin, copped my first key
Took a freeze, now I'm frozen
I bought a black Mac, I'm outta control
Losin bankrolls on blackjack, you gotta know
It always crossed my mind that Feds be tappin the lines like Gregory Hines
Still on the phone discussin my biz like it could never be mines
I know the price, know the risk, know the wrongs, and the rights
Still my blood flows ice, it's just my life

Chorus:

What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life?
*scratched "In my lifetime"*
What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life?
*scratched "In my lifetime"*

[Jay-Z]
I'm like the bass with the ass, splashin cold cash
The Big Willie get you chilly when I pass, brrrrrr
Is it, just a mirage all these girls thankin God
Is this, world my world, am I the star of stars?
Baby pimped out, I'm gettin too large and smokin cigars
All chicks is hollerin bout Jigga, the whole city's buzzin
Wasn't checkin for me a dozen or so, months ago
Now I'm all they know, I'm a person
Lettin the Cristal's breathe at the Barnacle Bar
Under my sleeve, vernacular, 50 G's
I'm talkin big cheese, you gotta be down to dig these, uhh
Give me a rush like you wouldn't believe, my head's about to bust
Acceleratin what drives me, hope I don't gotta die
To see, see I can't lie to me
I know the price, know the risk, know the wrongs and the rights
Still my blood flows ice, it's just my life

Chorus 2X

[Jay-Z]
Uhh, from the beginning see we never seen the ending
Running up in all the women, all the linen, all the jewels, huh
We sported Pele's, gold diamonds and Pirelli's
Sports cars, the good life'll give you a belly but that's cool
As I zone in the Al Capone, watch me
Cause the Medusa's head on Versace turned me to stone
Now my poems just ain't poems, they bloody, when I recite em
Bones get disconnected like the phones
Now, I'm a hardened criminal with game
Like the Garden, all my penpals life controlled by the warden
Still the drill makes me blind to the fact
I could do real time, I'm a prisoner, of my crimes
Know the price, know the risk, know the wrongs and the rights
Now I'm incarcerated for my life

Chorus 5X to fade[Intro:]
"Somehow the rap game remind me of the crack game"
Jigga! Feel me
People, told ya motherfuckers, told ya
"See that rap shit is really just like sellin smoke"
Uhh, Roc-a-Fella
Geyeah

[Verse 1]
We treat this rap shit just like, handlin weight
What they want we give it to em, what they abandon we take
Hit a rapper with consignment, let him know it's at stake
Put his ass in the studio, let him cook up a cake
When it's hot, get on my money spot in every state
Like the wiz in Camelot, the mom-and-pop's is the gate
But first we scope shit, advertise in every area
Let the fiends know hey, we got some dope shit
Gon' need a middle man, so we look to radio
Let em test the product, give em a promo show
Just a breeze, not enough to catch a real vibe
Then we drop a maxi single and charge em two for five
Ain't tryin to, kill em at first just, buildin clientele
So when the album drops the first weeks it's on sale
But when demand grows it's time to expand yo
You don't want no garbage papi it's ten grand per blow, fo' sho'

[Hook]
"Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game"
"See that rap shit is really just like sellin smoke"

[Verse 2]
Ge-ge-geyeah
I got that uncut raw to make a fiend's body jerk
Got your whole block now, pumpin my work
My CD's is like keys for you Willie's who
Like to floss my cassette tapes in sixty-two's
And my singles like gems, you know the treys
Get you high for a while, but the, high don't stay
You need another fix, you better cop these last two bricks
Cause when this shit flip, I'mma get on some other shit
Never pitchin for a label, Jigga's the hook-up
You know my shit is fish scale, y'all niggas is cook up
Just blow up, scream my name from Brooklyn to Da-kota
They know my shit stretch without the baking soda
Went from an eighth, to a quarter, to a half a key
Priority's work wasn't right so I switched factories
Now I'm the new nigga, who figured I'd get the game locked
Now watch how the prices of your cocaine drop[Intro]
It is indeed a pleasure
To see so many Nubian faces
So many original faces here tonight

Kick, kick, kick it

[Verse 1: The Jaz]
My rhymin and singin technique is applaudable
Livin in luxury, and it's affordable
No other brother is better than me, the J, the A, the Z
The cream of the crop, and the top of the top
The suckers are tryin to stop
The biggeda-, the biggeda-, the boss of the hip-hop
Hop, they'll never come near
They'll never come here, no, not this year
They're growin in fear, I'm very sincere, I will jerk tears
Operator pushin the data, I'm talkin bout info
And check it, you're still stumblin and bumblin off the intro
So take it a step at a time, this dope rhyme
Be makin a note that it's refined by a skilled mind
This is a warning for biters
Stealers and robbers and sucker reciters
Call it a night, and before you roam
Don't try this at home
The style that I'm usin, I'm here to abuse
The garbage and junk I refuse
Divy it up, cause I'm here to collect my dues from all of yous
This ain't no cartoon drama caper, pass the paper
Your mind's in a daze, higher than a skyscraper
I'm teachin and reachin and preachin
And showin and flowin and growin and blowin
The rest of the best right out of the box
I shoot the funky sweat socks
I obliterate and I devastate
You wanna go head to head
Rhymin until you fall dead?
Great, make it a date
Never a conflict or a debate, you're callin me sir, see
You sucker, you fucker, you pussy, you wussy, nobody can verse me
The Jaz is pushin the power
You two-bucks-an-hour
Unable, mentally unstable, to me you cower
You never can write a dope lyric to have an effect just like this did
To be at the peak in the field of hip-hop, you only wish, kid
And Jiggeda-Jay Zee, yo, yo, my partner
G-g-g-get on the mic, and cold start to

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Wreckin and wreckin in seconds less than speeds of light
So the miggeda-more that come, the miggeda-merrier, right, right
Excitin the mic much to the delight of millions of Nubians
And Amorites just can't understand the groove we're in
Cool, it might take a couple of takes for you to clarify
Don't lie, you coulda never got in on the first try
But never to worry, I'm not in a hurry, take your time
Cause it's my rhyme, I siggeda-said so, and I'm J-a-y-Z, y'all know me
I wish you co-write, cause you'd pay me all the rhymes you stole from me
Leave you freeze in a minute, you gotta get in it breathin
Only when it lets, no sweat, I stutter-step with ease, and
Stop fakin, you're makin it, son
I'm breakin and breakin and breakin your tongue
Don't get caught perpetratin the cool ones
Figure we're bigger and badder and better, and baby, let's face it
We bring havoc, flowin faster than rabbits, try to race it
The lyrical miracle writer, flippin until it drives you
Crazy, seek spiritual help from Jaz and Jay Zee
Standin in awe, you saw the best of em all, the rest will fall
Requestin for more, jaws stuck on the floor
These lyrics I pour, we saw, because we're greater
And we are the thiggida-thiggida-thiggida-the (the) originators
Word

Cure the blackman
And bring him back to the way he was
In his original state

Asalaam alaikum

To give power to the right to overcome bliss[Intro: Kay Slay]
G-Force (what's up Slay?)
I need you to make a hit for me (talk to me)
Four suspects (who?)
Busta Rhymes, Layzie Bone (who else?)
Twista, Jaz-O (I got ya)
There they go, take the shot!
Take the shot! DAMN!

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
When I come and I hop and I skip and I rhyme
And I dumb and I drop and I spit and I shine
Ay-ay-ay nigga what you really wanna do?
You ain't knowin that I'm comin to take what's mine
Every time I come to hit'cha
With a little bit of killa
Better know that you can never
Never see me little nigga
While I'm at the TOP
I will never STOP
When a nigga POP
See the way I run it, and leave a nigga bitter
Y'all know when I do my thing and I bang
Bidi-boom with a bomb and a BING!
Everybody know that when it comes to the shit I gotta spit
Motherfucker better crown me KING!
With a passion and a lot of action
See the way ya grab 'em, HOW YOU DO IT!
Then they wanna ask him
How a nigga smash 'em
See the way ya have 'em, DRAG 'EM TO IT!
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey-HEY!
Now you gotta know what a nigga do all day
Count bread make a nigga wanna bounce heads when I drop heat in these streets, okay?
You shitty with a get'cha gimmick
And I hope a lot of niggas live near a clinic
It don't really matter who you wanna ask about me
Cause I be the fiercest with it
While I'm givin you the final chapter
With a lot of laughter
See the way I capture
Everybody probably tellin you the same shit you don't really wanna come after!
Now I suggest you listen whenever you hear that the beat up in the buildin
Trust me, this is not the place for you to bring yo' children

[Verse 2: Layzie Bone]
The B-O-N-E we got plenty of flows;
From Cleveland, Ohio we rollin on vogues
They told me this record was only for pros
So Layzie gon' get in M.V.P. I suppose
Foes slammin them Cadillac do's
My story they caught has never been told
Sit back while I'm tellin this thuggish we blaze
Forever I'm young and'll never get old
Poppin a bottle of Ros√© when I rolls
Smell the aroma, just follow your nose
We thug on the corner from night 'til the sun up
You run up get done up, I'll let it explode
Blow only where gangstas roll, so
Homie we smash around and we crash collide
Whoever don't wanna be foes, oh
O.G. status, still got money up under the mattress
Nigga come get it I'll stick like cactus,
Money so tall those niggas need ladders
Try to come close but they never could match us
So catch us, we the masters
Y'all already know how we do it on the Clair
Never compare we livin' on stretchers
Willin to bet ya, when I twist and bust
Nigga come through with Twist and Bust
Nigga been famous they know to aim it
They spittin my languange, "Adrenaline Rush"
Feminine niggas that been on a rush
Back to the dust we winnin the clutch
Just slipped through to spit some real thug shit!

[Verse 3: Twista]
Now I be the coldest on the island, country or on the peninsula
Hit them with the venom and then I'mma
Disintegrate 'em or fade 'em, fuck 'em cause I hate 'em,
I'm hot if you not check the temperature
Mayday one Kay Slay, drop the bomb on 'em when they put me on the track and I'mma
Show 'em who was out when I make 'em go and commit suicide dressed like a Phantom or
Do and I'm about to get dinner
I'm about to open the do'
Cause I'm dope with the flow
Never know how flow was the 'dro
I'mma eat a bitch up and I hope for some mo'
So long is the poem, I'm never a ho
You can go check the portfolio
Kay Slay 'em just after fuck at you and then I'mma stick 'em, you know we can go
I'm cold so go get your coat
This be the season for niggas that's sneezin and snoozin
And if you keep testin me you gon' be catchin a beatin and bruisin - what's up?
Look at the mojo and look at the swag, and look at all the vernacular
Things I be doin cause I'mma stay infamous so they be callin me Dracula
Oops I mean Blackula when I'm attackin ya
Pullin up on 'em up in the new Acura
Or new pre-Camaro or new super Lego with the Pinot Grigio seats
I see when you niggas be hatin, so the next time when you see me don't speak
Now you know not to send me no beat
Cause I'mma kill it
And murder anybody That'll wanna get it
Where they wanna get up in it cause I be the realest
I'm a menace all the way up to the finish
Make an enemy diminish
When I get up in the battle even if it gotta be on the block
2010 hip-hop, the shit don't stop

[Layzie Bone]
Just slipped through to spit some real thug shit!

[Verse 4: Jaz-O]
What can it be?
Rappers and thuggin on beats
None of 'em keepin it street
Look at them calves, all of them wanna be bulls
None of 'em ready for beef
What about me?
Been through the pain
Sorted the lames, keep it the same
Skillful syllables kill
My rhymin technique is impeccable still
Anybody ever wanna run up
Will get done up in a hurry
Got a flurry
I'mma hunt 'em for the come up
With a bang you better run from the one until you permanently feel it
I will live it, idiots gettin it
"The Originator," gotta keep it greater
Keep the fader for the haters
Nigga real for real
The all-time thriller, ready rockin the death of it definite
On it cookin and cheffin it (ooh!)
Takin over the world
Made of with your girl
Motherfucker recognize the nigga Hugh Heff'in it
Doin what you never did at double time, triple shot president
Ain't nobody better in the residence
Cream of the crop, seein' it stop
Over the top, bringin the soul makin it pop
Got a old school banger make you do the wop
Got a Louisville slugger make you diddy-bop
Ever incredible gotta keep it way ahead of you
Screamin at my niggas in the clink doin federal
No trip, no travesty
I call the lick now I'm up like anti-gravity
Spit words from the brain like charity
If hip-hop was a broad she'd marry me
Gotta keep it gutter, gotta get the bread, gotta get the butter
Make it hot, you can toast word to mother

[Layzie Bone]
Just slipped through to spit some real thug shit![Intro]
The Street Smartz clique
For all you gun loving motherfuckers
For all you gat packers

[Verse 1: Fuc That]
Niggas should call me an army because I bomb beats
With nothing but thoughts that's concrete
With a brain that's charming
Puff a lot of buddha
?
To stop the future like a prosecutor
That's my specialty, I'm not a rap star or celebrity
Step to me, I'll leave his life in jeopardy, like leprosy (for real)
While there's a lot of others fronting
They make me want to smother something that have nothing but have motherfucking brothers busting
More and more, I was raw before with hardcore literature, metaphors galore
(You don't gotta guess what happened) Cuz when I'm done rapping
(Your only thoughts is gun clapping) none slapping
(And crumb snatching)
Infra sizer, with my crew I'm an improviser
My mental's liver than any gimmick or a synthesizer

[Hook]
Ain't no burner like the one I got
(No gun can bust you better)
Jam sometimes, but a less off a lot
(4 pounds, tec 9s, beretta)
Friends tell me I should leave it a home
(Nuh uh, nuh uh, nuh uh, nuh uh)
Tell them fools to get a gat of they own
(A gat of they own, a gat of they own)

[Verse 2: Fuc That]
F bombs is penetrating, with fire arms disintegrating
Bullet proof raps making your shots non-irritating
Fuck the nation, bitch you don't know what you facing, lacing
These pussy punks get punctured by my punctuation
The way you hear my shit, I bet you head'll swing
Cuz it's a ghetto thing, where we pack metal things just to settle things
Or you real motivators know the flavor
Because I release my vocal anger, whether you a star, or a total stranger
I got a murder esophagus, with knowledge through inoculate
All I see is officers and photographers
(This is for all the rappers that can't demonstrate)
Always anticipated to hear how my verbs is situated
You sleeping but you don't know me pervert
All of your homies heard it
Raps you shocked, like ? white he's after the OJ verdict
It's FT, and I'll let my shots wet you
Niggas is catching hot levels from the red dot special

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Syxshooter]
Partner the way I display my lyrical skills will fuck you up
Stepping in my path I'll buck you up
Because this style ain't nothing nice plus I'm down for whatever
Busting four pounds of better
I advice you cowards to keep your heads up
Because my beretta, you niggas more than wounded
When my mind is polluted with the essence of the buddha
Phony rappers get bruised, I'm trying to fuck wit FT and Syx shooter
Because Street Smartz in the mix, nine-six
So all you lame brain rappers talking that so called live shit
Get up with six grill and face the wrath of my nine clip
A bad boy, since I came from mama dukes
Plus I like to shoot guns, I'm blasting if you front
So what you want for? what you want for?
So pass the motherfucking ? the bone
I spray to wound any intruder in my circumference
You that of an enemy, punctured by bullets when my guns bust
I've never been a law-abiding citizen
True criminal doing anything to get the ends

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeah
I got the motherfucking Street Smartz clique up in here
No doubt
(FT)
Tru Criminal Records, nahmsaying?
Peace to Jay-Z, and all that
Nahmean? nahmsaying, for all you gun lovers
Packing gats, all you pistol whippers
Glock cockers, block lockers[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
I keep it fresher than the next, bitch
No need for you to ever sweat the next bitch
With speed, I make the best bitch see the exit indeed
You gotta know you're thoroughly respected by me
You get the keys to the Lexus, with no driver
You got your own '96 something to ride
And keep your ass tight up in Versace, that's why
You gotta watch your friends you got to watch me
They conniving, shit, the first chance to crack the bank
They try me, all they get is 50 cent franks
And papayas, from the village to the telly
Time to kill it on your belly no question
I got more black chicks between my sheets than Essence
They say sex is a weapon, so when I shoot
Meet your death in less than 8 seconds
Still pounding in my after life
Laughing, my shit is tight
Who you asking right

[Hook: Foxy Brown & (Jaz-O) with {Jay-Z}]
Ain't no nigga like the one I got
(No one can fuck you better)
Sleeps around but he gives me a lot
(Keeps you in diamonds and leathers)
Friends will tell me I should leave you alone
{Hah hah, hah hah, hah hah, hah hah}
(Tell the freaks to find a man of their own
Man of their own, man of their own)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Fresh to death in Moschino coach bag
Looking half black and Filipino faking no jacks
Got you a beeper to feel important
Surrounding your feet in Joan & David and Charles Jourdan
I keep you dove but love
You know these hoes be making me weak
Y'all knows how it goes b and so I creep
I've been sinning since you been playing with Barbie and Ken and
You can't change a players game in the 9th inning
The chrome rim spinning keeps them grinning
So I run way the fuck up in them
And wrinkle the face like linen
I play hard until they say "God
He's keeping it real Jigga stay hard"
Lord, don't even trip
I never slip, nigga, get a grip
What you don't see is what you get
Weapons concealed what the fuck y'all feel
When you niggas play sick we can all get ill
What the deal? (Foxy Brown)

[Hook]

[Jay-Z]
Yo, ain't no stopping this, no lie
Promise to stay monogamous, I try
But love you know these ho's be making me weak
Y'all know how it goes B so I stay deep

[Verse 3: Foxy Brown]
What up boo just keep me laced in the illest snakes
Bank rolls and shit, back rubs in the french tubs
Macking this bitch, wifee nigga
So when you flip that coke
Remember the days you was dead broke
But now you style and I raised you
Basically made you into a don
Flipping weight, heroin and shit
You know the pussy is all that
That's why I get baguettes, 5 carats and all that
From Dolce Gabana to H Bendel I'm ringing bells
So who the player, I still keep you in the illest gators
Tailor made so we can lay up in the shade reminiscing
On how I fuck the best and shit
Especially when I'm sipping Baileys
Don't give a fuck about how you move with them other mamis
I push the Z, eating shrimp scampi with rocks larger than life
Fuck them Reebok broads, you made it known who your wife was
I got you fronting in Armani sweaters, before this rap shit
When you was in leathers and bullshit berettas
And E classes with Mo in the glasses
Shows in Cali with all the flavor suede Bally's
Now all your mens is up in your Benz's
High post, I swear you be killing me
Playing inside my pubic hairs
I never worry about them other chicks
Cause you proved who was your wiz
When you was spending that bitch
I took a little when you was up north
Your commissary stay piling
How you living large on the island
All them collects have me vexed
But when you come home
Knew I was coming off with half of them checks
Now we on the rise
Your diamond mami with the slanted eyes
Holding this grip cocked the En Glee-Kay and shit
Fucks no, I see half of that dough
Made you into a star, pushing hundred thousand dollar cars

[Hook]She tossed the flamer '94 walked into danger
Behind the wall fought with a banger
Trapped in the beast, gas released, a rat deceased
Back on the street, back on her feet
Clappin the heat...

[unknown singer]
She's dressed to kill
Iced-out head to toe, a snake in black
She's cleared, to, get ill
She's about the dough, the black widow

[Verse 1: Kool G Rap]
Yo, she was a tight bird, female version of Iceberg
To put in the right words
Played the right curves, beige and white birds
The type she served it was quite superb
Ran through the city in a white suburb
Lived in a predominantly white suburb
She liked the herb, rockin all the richest type of furs
Make your life submerge if you strike a nerve
Dough she like to splurge
Shine of her light blurs from off her finger
Honey was off the ringer, the way she tossed the flamer
'94 walked into danger, behind the wall fought with a banger
Trapped in the beast, gas released, a rat deceased
Back to the street, back on her feet
Clappin the heat, from the back seat, in back of a jeep
Stackin the heat, pilin the ones
Made her point when violence was brung
Regulated and balanced the slums
Brought in a cat with a talent for guns
Click quick to silence a Dunn
Convoys of black limos
Employs strapped with mack millos
Bustin off caps through a cracked window, that's the MO
Push your wig back, make you a black Leno
The feds on her tracks got the phones tapped for info
Tryin to map the dividend flow, and where the ends go
Checkin on whose name the Benz go
Who pushes the buttons when Mac-10's blow
A rose on a black satin pillow
The silhouette of her web, killin for bloodspill, a black widow

[Hook: unknown singer] + (Kool G Rap)
She's (out for blood) dressed (for the kill) to kill (bustin slugs)
Iced-out (shit is real) head (livin crime) to toe (life of crime)
A snake (droppin heads) in black (pullin nines)
She's cleared (dodgin heat) to (play the street)
Get ill (let the guns blow, had to eat)
She's about (copped the raw) the dough (went to war)
The black widow (beef no more, cold fours at your door)

[Verse 2: Kool G Rap]
She was married but four times a widow
The fifth time ditto, kiddo
Step out of line, kitko, she spit nines and shi-dells
Put a pound to the tip of your niddose
Put em in line piddles
Diamond-stud shinin the clito', the web spinnin
With bloodstains soaked in the bed linen
Spread venom, known for bustin the lead grinnin, tilted red brimmin
Makin the lights inside of your head dimmin
Givin head to men and, leave a knife in they chest with a red ribbon
Bread to swim in, foes get left deader than Lennon
Threads of linen, sippin gin with a shread of lemon
Dead-up thoroughbred, slim and trim and stackin cake like Emminger's
Under the down coat brown coat like cinnamon
She went to have the Benjamins, for that she injure men
Send a squad to go and injure men that injure men
On top of that she popular, hit the opera
Francis Ford Coppola, mezzanine she's with binoculars
You even think about poppin her, stoppin her, moppin her, droppin her
Hard with bodyguards divin on top of her
Cops in they Blu-Blockers watchin her, steady clockin her
Jock her, dreamin of knockin her, thinkin a scheme for knockin her
Dress provocative, show the cleavage between her knockers
Bust a sock off with a blocker to rasta inside her locker
She cover the bills though, restaurant delicatessen Armadillo
White Willow, strike of the black widow

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kool G Rap]
She held a white weddin
Type settin just like a sight from heaven
Spend twice the bread'n from her last rice on her head'n
All types of presents, striking presence
Bodyguards ready to light they weapons, ignite the Wessons
Refuse to live the life of a peasant
Days and nights was right and type pleasant
At the foot of the aisles, took vows
With all the criminals and crook pals
That put smiles on niggas' necks while they look foul
Piles of cops peepin her central book files
Beef them niggas cook wild, groom lookin shook style
Forced into marriage, horse and a carriage
Remember lifespan shorter than average, lady boss flossin her carats
Dreams to get rich and perish in Paris
Cherish the cabbagem, makin her path out of the church passage
Thugs they do they dirt massive
Skirt slashed, first class, Doni Amberg glasses
Flirt with her lashes
Snapshots, smirk for the flashes
Plots to leave her murked in the masses
Two killin experts on the grasses
Put in they Tec work for the cashes
Leave the Earth hurt with a passion
Two louds shots burstin in action
Made her head jerk from the blastin
Lady down, holdin her shirt gaspin, hit by another turf assassin
Reason not even worth askin; the facts are real, though
Got her cap peeled for stackin real dough
Lifestyle brillo when you're rollin for krill dough
Death of a black widowRepresent, show niggas the deal
I'm packing my blue steel, keeping it real
Cause niggas were born to kill

[Lil Fame]
Here comes the Brownsville slugger, motherfucker
I bust off shots at fools
To avoid these obstacles
I roll deep, me and my nigga Llama
With about seven niggas thats up in the clip to bring the drama
Homicide, take a ride in the hearse
Enemies out to hit me, but I'mma see em first
I'm ready, steady, and deadly but yet nervous
Let my burner serve its purpose and remove him off the surface
Gunshots let off! My instincts was to get him
Make sure I hit him, then break North, shonuff!
Holding down my fort, taking no shorts of no sorts
My four five turn to a blowtorch
It's still cocked! I tried to get away safe
Yo that shit was hot as hell I still stuck it in my waist
Dud my dirt, YEAH, did murk, YEAH, murder was the case
Then it hit heart beating like a nigga on base
I found a spot, chilled, parlayed for a second
Fixed my weapon, then headed back to my section
Now I'm back home smoking and drinking I'm bent now
I meditate on flashbacks of how it went down
It's kill or be killed, thats a true fact
There ain't no telling when these niggas are coming to bust open your back
It's ill, it's real, but still I feel
If provoked murder, nigga I'm born to kill

[Billy Danze]
Yo, it's the case of the state
Versus the great one seven one eight
Gun slinger from Brownsville
Where niggas were born to kill

[LaShonda]
Yo, some chick think she saw you jump up out the jeep
You said you was across the street laying with the heat

[Billy Danze]
What? That bitch lying
Here's a cocksucker I never heard of
I ain't doing time for no motherfucking murder
When Mr. Gonzalez was stretched in the mud
I was home with the dog dome taking down what's up
Therefore I'm innocent!

[LaShonda]
Mad shells were spit

[Billy Danze]
They ain't mine
I do damage with an Imp, they found shells from a nine
This shit is crazy
Would you please contact Lazy
Tell him I need an attorney
To ride with me on this motherfucking journey
Now, ten months later, after being indicted
Third off of fifteen are clickin' shit so fuck it I'mma fight it
Me and the Jewboy lay back after D.A. spoke
Cross examination, Bernstein jumped up and broke no joke
Stepped over the judge's crown
Stepped on the D.A.'s ground
Looked at the snitch with a frown
Went to the jury and got down
Seventy-two hours later, creeping on some playing the wall shit
Toting the same Glock Mr. Gonzalez got knocked off with

2x[Intro: Sauce Money]
Ayo, Jay, word up. These mothafuckas fucking talking that comeback shit like they cooking crack. Shit, I ain't fronting, all I want my pockets green like slum change, you know what I'm saying? Front the roll we roll back like rubbers, mothafucka, for real, with no trace of age. We keep our pockets fully blown, Roc-A-Fella clique, nigga

[Verse 1: Sauce Money]
We patting down pussy from Sugarhill to the Shark Bar
Fuck a bitch D in the marked car
We got the bad bitches gasping for air in Aspen
Searching for Aspirin when I ascend, we swing
You cling we do our thing and bring
Slinging your ding-a-ling from Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn to Beijing
East coast host is hostile colossal
Money flaring like nostrils for drug dealing apostles
Al Pacino down to Nino Brown
Me, Jay and Primo, got it sewed across the board like Poquino
Teflon, make sure your jammy is full
Cause I heard, Sammy the Bull lamps in Miami with pull
Tropical leaves where I got a few keys
With my man I'll stock a few G's, now it's unstoppable cheese
Said we was garbage, so fuck college
Street knowledge amazing to scholars when we coin phrases for dollars
Star studded bitches with crystals
Get fucked with pistols, just to see my shit, discharge puss
I drop the stellar, even acapella
I got to tell all about Roc-A-Fella

[Hook: Fat Joe]
Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Mannerisms of a young Bobby DeNiro, spent Spanish wisdoms
In a whip with dinero, crime organized like the Pharoahe
I CREAM, I diamond gleam
High post like Hakeem, got a lot of things to drop
Brooklyn to Queens, I gotta keep my steam
Niggas wanna try to hem my long jeans
Uptown fiend for Jay-Z to appear on the scene
In the meanwhile, here's something dope for y'all to lean
Liaison for days on in
Money make the world go around so I made some to spend
Can I live, did dough with my nigs
Dividends flow like the Mississippi Riv' looking jig
Can't do for dolo, had to turn away when Tony killed Manolo
That's real, mixed feelings like a mulatto
Thug thought he was O.G. Bobby Johnson
I played him like Benny Blanco, mano a mano
You ain't ready, I fire no trigger straight up, shoot my guns horizontal
Get your weight up, I am
Two point two pounds, you're barely a hundred and 25 grams
Wouldn't expect y'all to understand this money
Do the knowledge, due to few dollars, I'm due to demolish
Crews Brooklyn through Hollis to a hood near you, what the fuck?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Jaz]
Money is power, I'm energetic with facial credit
Pure platinum fetish for cheddars
Spread lettuce heroes get deadish
I make moves that remove pebbles out of shoes
You suck pistol like pipe with the crystal
John Stockton couldn't assist you
Convoys of Benzes like we fouling in the U.N
So what the fuck you doing? Whatever, nigga
Fahrvegnugen, rugged yet polished
Spanking dollars with the commas
Banging bitches out the Bahamas
On hides of llama we cry nada, fly farther
Fry hotter, you die gotta, fuck with me witness ma√±ana
Absence of malice in my palace
Call cousin now Dallas trigger finger with the callus
Tip scales from mail to keep these niggas off balance
Your frequent stops to O.T.B. you feeding me
Steam a nigga scheming on the wrist action with the gleams
Jewels for Pop Duke fulfill your dreams
Never put the pure brown sugar before the dirty green cream

[Hook][Verse 1: Ransom]
I've been having some deep thoughts with that L blowing
Niggas in jail knowing
When you do it, do it yourself
And never tell no one
You see them shells blowing
I'll go to hell knowing
That I had them eagles sit em down like Terrell Owens
I spell evil backwards
I gotta live
If money's the root of evil
Then fuck it I'm an evil bastard
You know that diesel acid
When it reach the masses
I swear to God it'll burn
Turn the streets to ashes
Dope in the Charger
Still smoking L's laughin
I'm coaching the carter
Call me Samuel Jackson
Nigga's been fags
Funny like Sinbad
Me, I'm from the hood
My life saving's in a gym bag
I'm flaming the forty
I ain't even sorry
If you're with your kid
Then I'll put your brain on your shorty
I ain't open that damn Glock for the fame and the glory
I was hoping to jam rocks like Damien Marley

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Hey yo, I'm living better
Second letter with a set of wings
Butter leather
Hoodie sweater and some better bling
Black Beretta
These niggas better not have said a thing
For that cheddar I'm not a forgetter or regret a thing
I could get her
Don't have to sweat in order to get her things
I'll forget her
It feel better just to let her cling
When you met her she was better than Coretta King
Ya'll lived together
She was gonna get a wedding ring
She chose me and blows me like she owes me
You know me
I take whatever life throws me
Shows me
Girls don't like boys
They like cars, money and some of that good smoke
Kush jars and twenty
Tell a few good jokes
But it's far from funny
When you in the hood broke
You see I understand what make niggas underhand
So I put a hundred grand just to put you on the lam
This ain't what you wanted man

[Verse 3: Paul Cain]
I'm a problem for every rapper breathing
On every track I'm meeting
It's a fact
I'mma be factor in rap this season
I pull my strap and squeeze it
Coming with a pack of demons
That'll leave the pastor bleeding
You ain't gotta ask the reason
I know what Shaq was scheming
You can see the tiger stripe J from a mile away
Yellow, white, and glasses gleaming
Chain so sick
I don't need a piece for it
I can hear the streets talking
I dare you to reach for it
I'm strapped
If you look closely you can see the torrents
Hate niggas that keep talking
They usually be informants
That Brooklyn bullshit
You better believe I'm on it
You know if I mean I bought it
Flow sick, put G's up on it
And naw
I don't get along with these rapping cats
They mad my chain's the same size as their platinum plaques
Thats a fact
Let me get mine first, then after that
I'm completely done with rap
You cats can have it back

[Verse 4: Stack Bundles]
Had a Hummer and Range Sport thoughts for the winner
Summer thoughts for the winter
It's Long John weather
Fiends come with shorts in the winter
Shoveled snow in the winter
Hope you're getting my drift
You should hold your head back when you get in a drip, drip
A little grip
I could cover the order
Wanna floss, I'm a boss
I'll confront you, recorder
See the cross all flooded
Little stones on the border
And I just got a divorce
So I'm looking for Run's daughter
Tell the rev that I'm dealing with some evils
The sun shine on em cause the coup ceiling's see-through
Dainty women, Antique denim
His pockets gotta be nauseous
The man's keep spending
Tricking on niggas
Throw a little kitty on em
My niggas will sic em and empty out the semis on them
You'd rather spit on God than go against him
Ain't no second guessing
It's SQUAD UP convinced em

[Verse 5: Jaz]
They can't take me in the dark grey Jag
Seats the same leather as the Mark Jake bag
But Jaz the kind of bitch that the narcs may tag
Cause I'm bringing the kind of butter like Parkay had
And no, I ain't the ho that want a nickel to earn
The street bitch need a stack that's as thick as a curve
And you might catch a chick in the burbs
Maybe cause I'm, nice with the nouns
And slick with the verbs, yeah
It's Ms. Jizzaz
Fizzaz and spizzaz
I'm like Betty Shabizzaz
With a little pizzaz
I wasn't sworn in just to join in
Been family since the morning that I was born in
And getting money is hereditary
That California kush got my eyes red as cherries
These bitches waiting on they next pay day
I'm in a XK-8
With the body of an ex-Playmate
And I'm still holding the SK straight, nigga[Big Jaz]
Know I do dat
[Jay-Z]
Hell Yeah. Let's start from the top
(singing intro)
Need to just kill that shit
You go first though, huh

[Big Jaz]
Go back!
Don't know Karate, but I kick back like a 45-70
Givin' yall niggas hell, enablin' me to live heavenly
Hit y'all faggots with my worst, still never get the best of me
Don't call me money 'less you investin' me
I'm the answer but you find time to question me
Fine wines and dimes blessin' me
Primetime professional over the bread like sesame
Crime stressin' water testin'
Got me arrested again, tested again
Tryin' to swim with the whales
Say you 'bout to blow with no wind in yo sails
Can't convince me, flinch or hench me
My shit is cut and dry, motherfucker drench me
I dare yo chilly ass to the 9th degree
There ain't been a true and livin' in your life since me
Pinch me, you movin' backwards when I'm slo-mo
My style'll bag a boy like a homo
Into linen like Yoko Ono
You can fry, so relax no lie
Power from bed eye, sendin' niggas beddy-bye why?
My team in the Big East take down your whole wack conference
Whole repetoir's pompous, know yo ass square walkin' 'round with a compass

[Tone Hooker]
Yo, Now what we 'bout to do is put down Foundation
(When it's time to step it up)
We rise to the occasion, but in order for you to put down Foundation
(You gotta)
Stash your funds,then automatic cream grows sporadic

[Jay-Z]
Hey y'all, I used to wreck off, bust the Tec off
Pop the cork off Moet off y'all, 3 quarters of the way
Now that's history, pop Christy 'till I'm pissy
Jigga, who is he? How bad y'all wanna know?
Stick my head out the V-twizzy ,Get Busy
Bust lead out, let the world feel the misery
Goin' loco, elude po-po
Prelude to a champion, competion
Not for nothin', can't be none
Limited edition, like the Lex with Coach leather
'cept my approach is better, now or never
However, y'all want it the style's forever
'till it's redundant, Jigga!
Me and my operation, runnin New York night scene
With one eye closed like
Peter Geisha
None of our foes have an idea, back in the days
To fool the Feds used to run our clothes for years
How can you possibly stop me?
I'm approximately a million overhead, U.S. Dollars
Product take cream like Juan Valdez
We's Kodak, Papa. See true co-lors

[Tone Hooker]
Yo, Now what we 'bout to do is put down Foundation
(When it's time to step it up)
We rise to the occasion, but in order for you to put down Foundation
(You gotta)
Stash your funds,then automatic cream grows sporadic
Yeah, we puttin' down Foundation
(now it's time to step it up)
So rise to the occasion, but in order for you to put down Foundation
(You gotta)
Stash your funds,then automatic cream grows sporadic

[Sauce Money]
Polish your wings for this fly shit
The Bed-Stuy do or die shit, this 325i shit!
You get nothing, child we buck and wild
Roc-A-Fella Clik nigga, you know my fuckin' style
When I deliver, niggas just don't give a
Fuck about nuthin', go all out like Hitler
Not enough doses to close this, it's hopeless
Fuck who the host is, nigga we the dopest
Motherfuckers rappin', Sauce Money had to happen
Record setter, record seller, Roc-A-Fella
Comin' thru like Idi Amin obscene
You do ya best while I fuck the prom queen
Flick cum on ya, drop the bomb on ya
Seperate ya clik, man lost an arm on ya
Love the position that we hold know
Crazy Juice, chicks quick to get open like Nicole Brown
Or heart surgery, to smart to murder me
3rd burn degree if ya start distubin' me
Word to mother, life's a bitch fuck her
Jaz and Jay stuck her, Sauce next in line with the rubber
Went from outcome to income, pretend some men come
They win none, I'm all that and then some
Duck to blink and not enough, you sinkin'
Pussy minds I penetrate what the fuck you thinkin?

[Tone Hooker]
Now what you heard was niggas puttin' down Foundation
(when it's time to step it up)
We rise to the occasion, but in order for you to put down Foundation
(You gotta)
Stash your funds,then automatic cream grows sporadic
Yeah, we puttin' down Foundation
(now it's time to step it up)
So rise to the occasion, but in order for you to put down Foundation
(You gotta)
Stash your funds,then automatic cream grows sporadic
Yeah uh

[Sauce Money]
Word up, you know how that shit go
It's about that fuckin' time
Big muthafuckin Jaz, with the help of the capo, the nigga Jigga
Represent that shit, word
And me? heh heh, whatever
Yeah, that's hot right there! Ha Ha Ha[Verse One]
I was lyrically hip hop's top five
Before two of my niggas died
Syntax and deep impact Bruce Willis couldn't survive
A strange death, since niggas wasn't loud
I'm throwin' monitors offstage
Cause Rakim said move the crowd
I'm one year older, ten times more determined, partner
A hairy situation like Chaka fuckin' Chewbacca
Connect the dots, murder by design
Shit on your intellect, and fertilize your mind
Pull out the gauge and we can face off like Nicolas Cage
Battle for the second coming of Christ and see whose soul gets saved
One might be your girl so don't trust her
I'll tell her like Usher
Girl I'll make you wanna leave the clown you with
Start a new relationship
Make the bitch take the dick
She ate the dick too, though, that's Mr. mafioso dulo
We bustin' caps at your culo....

[Saafir]
Waterproof, baby. Know what I'm sayin? That means we can't be wet

[Sample]
(The waterproof MC, you ain't wettin' me
You need to stop rappin' and start robbin' banks like Steady B)

[Verse Two]
My style is sex and violence
Vocabulary and science
In an uneasy alliance
Let's toast the bread like a plugged up appliance
(I'll drink to that!)
Remy on the rocks, the real is-stated eventually, son
Reverse the purdy props to prop-perty like, Century 21
I want the mansion and the yacht
And all the shit them rich wack rappers got
(Then the ultimatum was read)
Like every MC woke up with a thouroughbred horsehead in their bed
In other words, teflon top with kevlar nuts
The closest I've ever been to ass was cigarette butts
I'm nice, that's probably why I don't be fuckin' with Sprite
Cause thirst is nothin', image is everything on the mic
These days, these DJs get paid under the table
Pay the most popular producer on the most popular label
Pay for full page ads in the most popular magazine
Now you got the most popular new artist
Guaranteed the air we breathe is thin, better tell her
Then I'mma choke the bitch out at 11:59, reveal the real Cinderella
(AAAAAAHH!) When two hydrogens reach my oxygen atom
You can't gat 'em or get at 'em
Anatomically designed to be solar, fuck the rap star
When I die I want niggas doin drive-by's with my ashes in the car
R-A-S, H2O liquifyin' your assets
Repo your flow even in (prepo letho?)
Straight outta Aruba, lampin' with my boo from Bermuda
Lickin' rugers in Cuba, blowin' niggas out the frame
With brass knuckles and a tuba, my new maneuver is scuba
360 degrees of revenge like Montezuma

*more scratching*
[Saafir]
Waterproof...know what I'm sayin?
It's like this man....
Know what I'm sayin?
Muthafuckas really gotta like reach within themselves
And pull your spirit out your mouth...
Knowmsayin? But now it's all good cause I'm in
Relation with the truth!
You gonna have to really be yourself potna
Look Me in the retina

[Verse Three]
When it's my time to shine, the whole world is goin' blind
From the sheisty side of town where a nickel cost a dime
Niggas is (Boston?), black brothas is bastards
The bubble break bread and give a nigga space like NASA
I catch red-eye flights to rock mics
Spent too many drunk nights fuckin' gold diggers and dikes
Same shit, different toilet though
Concentrated to blow
I moonwalk across hot coals on my tippy toes for the flow
Stay low key like midget doorknobs
Stay above the law like Judge Judy giving blow jobs
Satisfaction, three out of four Braxtons
Especially Toni
Fuck affirmative action
Cause Anglo-saxon factions is packin' Mack-10s
Trainin' for helter skelter when the race war begin
Stay true to the game, but the game ain't true to the MC
Where niggas is bootleggin' Makaveli 2 and 3

[Saafir]
Real game...waterproof..with the name, man. Listen to the name, man
Waterproof don't have no muthafuckin (?) Junction, with nothin. Ain't no
Image!

*scratching*I'm discussin it so buss it, cold profilin
Spent a little while in the Hawaiian Islands
Off the plane and hospitality came correct
A gang of aloos places round my neck
Bathed by the sunshine and the seas of pearls
Fanned by tanned skinned beautiful girls
A twitch of grass skirt caught my eye
I said aloha baby word life you're lookin fly
I said my name is Jaz and did amaze me
When she said the rapper yeah me and partner Jay-Z
My witness wasn't she stacked
Wasn't she pumpin slammin workin -- so true indeed black
She said I'd love to stay and chat but I'll
See you at the luau, won't that be nice now
Later on we can examine each other more closely
And by the way my name is Sophie

The luau was sharp, right Jay? (On the strength money)
Laughter good food and tons of honeys
Eat and be merry, festive drums playin
A real cool atmosphere, you know what I'm sayin?
Tipped through the crowd, aloha aloha
Mingled like a single, then yo I
Stopped dead in my tracks, and my heart did freeze
Eyes wide surprised to find Sophie's
Smilin at the Jaz for some reason or other
Clockin a brother, but standin with another
Who just so happened to catch her expression
Look in my direction as a sign of aggression
Approachin me and yo I ain't lyin
Was this big coconut eatin barefoot giant
Face to face I mean chest to face
My first prepared to hook off in haste
Then Sophie sweete than sugar a good looker
Broke in between, before homeboy shook her
Grabbed her took her away on the wild tip
On a macho tripthat ain't hip
Look to my partner Jay (yeah I saw it)
Shrugged his shoulders said (hey I can't call it)
I said I think she should just up and go free
Then I can be with a girl, named Sophie

Walked along the beach by self til dawn
Askin myself what the hell goes on
She's so thorough, but she got a man he ain't right though
And besides she's a stranger to me quite so
Those thoughts were troublin
Til the sunlight shone on a figure and I was bubblin
Like a dream it seemed when she approached me
Talkin about none other than Sophie
Looked into my eyes, anxiety gone
Told me she's been thinkin bout me all night long
I asked about the island kid she said "What of him?"
I said "Ain't he your man, whassup, don't you love im?"
Sophie screamed she need a woman's dream
Not a cartoon sucker from a comic scene
Close embracin her eyes full of tears
But we spoke of the devil, and slap, he appeared
Speedin toward us like a heat-seekin missle
But yo, I ain't no cat with that "P" initial
Homeboy was large, I must've been crazy
Sophie said "No" I said "Yo, get out the way baby!"
No words spoken, major slugfest
Twent minutes and homeboy's head put to rest
All for the best cause the big prize the trophy
Was my heart of Hawaii whose name is Sophie[Intro: Ja Rule (& Jaz-O):]
Alright fuck that
Ain‚Äôt nothing going down

[Verse 1: Ja Rule:]
Spear yourself the reality of an ass with me
That giving when i'm getting tight & start flippin‚Äô
On you bitch ass niggas that like forming them cyphers
It gets me hyper, on the real i'm a slice ya
Light ya ass up with sixteen or more
Slugs coming from mys the nose bulldog
Raw, to the callest lay down some laws
This is Ja‚Äôs house bow down or bring the war
Motherfuckers, ya‚Äôll know the touch was hot
What it ever be, the mic, the Glock, the drug spot
Like a bitch, scared of life, & taking chances
& right now you‚Äôre showing more ass then exotic dancers
The answer is this, niggas don‚Äôt want to touch
Ja life, stronger then a fucking coak rush
See on the streets, I‚Äôll be killing niggas like cash got
Shit in the smash, blunts leak with hash

[Verse 2: Jaz-O:]
Now I‚Äôm on a planet called dark in these streets I spark
Three dash two get your rustics a fuck apart
The enemy is semi plus I don't take know Christmas
Niggas is crazy, caught up getting stabbed by their little sisters
Now I‚Äôm in my own world, I sell girls, with peals
Who sip pete a half pound to call me
I roll up on Lenox, in a Lex with 10 inch
Go in the gamble spot with a knot, sol stop with sin it
I heard the nigga say short paper
But I let most leave with them hoes, I see them bitches later
I‚Äôm in the mother fucking streets full of creeps & freaks
I sell rocks on blocks where the hustlers never sleep
I‚Äôm in too deep & I can‚Äôt get out, cause it‚Äôs all about the spouts
Sticking dicks in these bitches mouth
RMFARAED I‚Äôm from the UPT
Automatically you can't fuck with me

[Bridge:]
That's how we do it in the 95'
It's do or die in this game, sit & wonder why
The game is Stryth, the Creeps Creep at night
The rap game fake niggas get sliced

[Verse 3: Chris Black:]
I sold my sole to the streets
By bumping cracks & packing heat
Straight Benj‚Äôs were my 9 speak, your knees get weak
That calico feel so sweet, Shredding threw your meat
I‚Äôm the maker now meet defeat, the shit was playing
While bagging grams, which grams
I‚Äôll be damned if the bitch infiltrates the fam
Class cot, cribs tight like fort knots
It‚Äôs war time mother fucker
Pull your heater out your ice box
My crews clicking, black tots we pitching
Gets an ass whipping, over slug if you get the snitching
Use a bitch & I can sense fear in your heart
So I spurt, creped on your crew left a dart

[Verse 4: Jay-Z:]
Juliany's got me & my primaries thinking grimy can‚Äôt hustle no more
Got to get this money threw muscle For sure
Me & my wild life, young is running up, gun it up
Stake out your money spot then done it up
Wit gun play, you faggots warfare, you won Jay
Just let a nigga see his son some day
Shut up, no compassion, kept blasting
Shit, you will never see me slipping‚Äô sipping more
It‚Äôll be, no revenge, I tie your boy loose end
Strictly been the worst witness since you & your dead friends
I don‚Äôt just hit you with nails like these other rappers
This Shit I spit make you hit the ground
When I sigh figh ‚ÄòGabba Gabba‚Äô the step show starts
Even in the barber shop, you don‚Äôt want no part (nagga)

[Verse 5: Black Child:]
I‚Äôve been living illaginament since I could hold my dick
Finchley I‚Äôm fit, mentally I‚Äôm sick
This rap shit might keep me from doing sticks
& blowing up bricks on neighbourhood strips
I put holes in niggas soles for real
Me & my 9 mil up the rob & steel
& my mag 10‚Äôs my best friend
Ever we been stick up you‚Äôll niggas like skins
& cooking up coak for the niggas that smoke
I pull out my gat & everybody get ghost
Cause black child got a stile that‚Äôs awkward
The Mac is what I walk with, shots is what I talk with
I live life like it ain‚Äôt no tomorrow
My heart is hollow I feel no sorrow
Or pity for anyone in this fucked up city
I get pissy & then get busy, you know who is he


[Verse 6: Nemesis:]
Fuck that clown ass rapping
Got two others on burn, now watch it happen
Street level attacking, challenges lacking
Raw is in satisfaction, slugs from the calibres
Dead you know the action, friend that ass can win
Fuck the rap level & take to a mag 10
Where the war begins & then son I stay blasting
Eradicating niggas in the violent like fashion
Your shit‚Äôs petty, like robbing banks in Madahand
While I‚Äôm power moving cross seas to the the vad again
Ask me the Raegon nephew the over view injector
Is the only to perfect a hallucinate in toxic style niggas
Watch it closely now you think twice before you approach me
The mischievous, smoking niggas ass cracks like cannabis
Rap is a bitch so I lass foe my click, stash of raw dope
Uncut bomb shit, niggas catch fits get fucked like chicks
Real niggas bleed chocolate cause their so salt less
Bodying niggas, say mother fuck the charges


[Verse 7: Dmx:]
A cruddy nigga, going a raw dog & dirty bitches
& if I give birth I‚Äôm giving that to 30 bitches
You say you know a nigga like me, guess again poppy
Cause I might smile up in your face but I ain't your friend poppy
Jump out fifteen hundred like run it
Niggas don‚Äôt want it, get done it, when I‚Äôm blunded
How it ever it went down, I made it happen, I made it scrappin‚Äô
I made fussing, busting, I made capping
& letting off wasn‚Äôt nothing new to a nigga
Something to do to a nigga, cause you a fool nigga
I know your type, you hype about all of that fake shit
& can‚Äôt understand by, a man would had to take shit
Or steel shit, but this that real shit, niggas kill shit, pill shit
I‚Äôll hit you in your head you won‚Äôt feel shit
Err, Let the dogs loose on the niggas ass
Find out if the nigga‚Äôs faster than the trigger blast
A fucking saint in its truest form
Know it damn well what I do is wrong, but still I do it strong
Niggas is making movies, but I got to stop production
I need a block to function & maybe I‚Äôll stop destruction
Cause blocks are not for fronting
So give that Sorty, cause you don‚Äôt need that Sorty
You don‚Äôt know what to do with that Sorty
You may as well hit this 40, before you hit the floor
Another 24, what you want money more![Verse One: Styles]
My click is in it til it's over, never sober
Bustin over, lay in the lane with the 'caine in the Rover
Pray to Jehovah, for the nigga with the Ruger
The young Don, the Heron mover
You know my hustle, I bring the fo' pound to the tussle
Motherfuck your pit with no muzzle
So chill cuzo, let me blow for my niggas
Runnin round, get down like motherfuckin gorillas
Shorty bop the wolop, in the spot with the dollop
Pot full of acid, I got the game mastered
Move dimes, hit twenties addicted to gettin money
It could be a hundred degrees and never look sunny
Black I'm tryin to live, somethin got to give
But everyday's the same old, runnin from po-po
Mom think I'm loco, cause I sell crack and puff cocoa
Yo, it's the style see it's still the same
And when worse comes to worse, I steal the 'ciane
Papi know my face, so he don't expect it
Runnin from the gutter so he gots to accept it
Stripped his ass naked, then I put a slug in him
He just another motherfucker, ain't no love in him
I put a bug in him, never sleep on one who never slept
I take my last breath every time I hit the meth
It's the D to the E, M to the O N
Blowin, steady playin shotgun, throwin
Don't you see the shorty with the baseball cap
Don't make me flip motherfucker with this baseball bat
Best to brace yo' gat, 'fore I brace mine, cause I lace nine
From yo' dome to yo' motherfuckin spine

[Hook: Puff Daddy]
I be, that nigga that yo' niggas can't fuck wit
That nigga that yo' bitches wanna creep wit
That nigga that you can't get along wit
Playa hate but you wanna do a song wit
That nigga that you see in the videos
That nigga with the jewels and the jiggy hoes
That nigga that'll die for his main man
That nigga with the gettin money gameplan

[Verse Two: Sheek]
Haven't you heard that Bad Boys move in silence yet?
When you increase the peace, the mo' wild it get
I'm only sizin you niggas from the waist up
And I ain't, wettin no parts you can't touch with makeup
Mr. Jacob without the Ladder
It don't matter clap your wake up and do a shakeup
Nobody badder, since the, baby finksta
I was in the playpen wai-tin for kids to enter
Shit I even blitz the rich to get chips
Housekeeper disguised with the nine bubble grip
Extra clip in the vacumn if I slip
Room service ring the alarm and get the bomb
Blown to Hong Kong wide been long gone
Plus I got the power to ramshack, you dig that?
Worldwide while you simply thug where you live at

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Jadakiss]
You don't really wanna get involved, with the L-O-X car-tellers, Goodfellas, that's who we are
You can't outsell us, it ain't shit you could tell us
Jealous dog, cause we spread like relish
Bad Boys, and we all eat together
When it go down, then we draw heat together
Since I made the connection with the big man
I done got big plans, to be a little nigga in the big Land
Ghetto star, presidential all gift wrapped
And what you call weight? I know cats who sniff that
Enjoy life, what are you sayin?
If the DA ain't got a nigga payin, papi got him weighin
Anything to do with money you can count J in
Next time we bring it to these faggots we ain't playin
Cream of the crop, and we ain't never gon' stop
Hittin you in your head with that butter from The Lox

[Hook] - fades out[Jay-Z]
It's the thought of a ride that make my eyes wide, I'm caught up
I'm trying to make, all of my dreams materialize, so I sorta
Say my goodbyes to the straight and narrow
I found a new route, you bout to see my life change
I make the means justify the ends, I make the cream
Materialize keys to a Benz, and so I'm rollin
For now, holdin down the fort, who's controllin?
The ground's gotta blow em, yep, y'all shoulda told em
Uhh, my first felony's approachin, copped my first key
Took a freeze, now I'm frozen
I bought a black Mac, I'm outta control
Losin bankrolls on blackjack, you gotta know
It always crossed my mind that Feds be tappin the lines like Gregory Hines
Still on the phone discussin my biz like it could never be mines
I know the price, know the risk, know the wrongs, and the rights
Still my blood flows ice, it's just my life

Chorus:

What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life?
*scratched "In my lifetime"*
What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life?
*scratched "In my lifetime"*

[Jay-Z]
I'm like the bass with the ass, splashin cold cash
The Big Willie get you chilly when I pass, brrrrrr
Is it, just a mirage all these girls thankin God
Is this, world my world, am I the star of stars?
Baby pimped out, I'm gettin too large and smokin cigars
All chicks is hollerin bout Jigga, the whole city's buzzin
Wasn't checkin for me a dozen or so, months ago
Now I'm all they know, I'm a person
Lettin the Cristal's breathe at the Barnacle Bar
Under my sleeve, vernacular, 50 G's
I'm talkin big cheese, you gotta be down to dig these, uhh
Give me a rush like you wouldn't believe, my head's about to bust
Acceleratin what drives me, hope I don't gotta die
To see, see I can't lie to me
I know the price, know the risk, know the wrongs and the rights
Still my blood flows ice, it's just my life

Chorus 2X

[Jay-Z]
Uhh, from the beginning see we never seen the ending
Running up in all the women, all the linen, all the jewels, huh
We sported Pele's, gold diamonds and Pirelli's
Sports cars, the good life'll give you a belly but that's cool
As I zone in the Al Capone, watch me
Cause the Medusa's head on Versace turned me to stone
Now my poems just ain't poems, they bloody, when I recite em
Bones get disconnected like the phones
Now, I'm a hardened criminal with game
Like the Garden, all my penpals life controlled by the warden
Still the drill makes me blind to the fact
I could do real time, I'm a prisoner, of my crimes
Know the price, know the risk, know the wrongs and the rights
Now I'm incarcerated for my life

Chorus 5X to fade[Verse 1]
If I lay low and let the day go it'll slow my payroll
Aye-yo I'm a terrorize charge and slay shows
Ra slay flows go as far as the Barbados
On the turntable sound like tornadoes
My style is performed like tropical storms
Your not to get on the whole spot will get torn
I keep the metropolitan hollering and bring the dollars in
Keep the models following wise as King Solomon
Come slow through the jungle like an animal
Invade any land I go like General Hannibal
From Long Island to Queens light up the New York scenes
All the way to New Orleans and everything in between
Left to go bless a show in Mexico
Next Thing I know it's extra cold I see Eskimo's
Time to rock get it hot soon as I get in there
Spit in they ear so flow they froze and I disappear

[Hook]
It's a must that I bust any mic that you hand to me
It's inherited it runs in the family

[Verse 2]
They said I was a head of my time or either here before
To see the idea clear it takes a year or more
Now times that by the years I reign straight-seven
No hear for four years still multiplied by eleven
The silence's a set back make em regret that
One way to get back is violence and wet cats
But hold your head black or I'll never rap again
Just when I thought I was out they pulled me back in
Now that was two years ago and if cats start interfering
Then I'm a go back to the gat and racketeering
My sabotage is camaflouge and espionage
You ain't havin Ra so don't test the god
I'm takin' all orders I can't afford extorters
I hit em in the head with a hundred dollars in quarters
So warn a friend tell em it's on again
If it's a freestyle bust in a park I want in

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I managed to get paid for a decade now add three years on to that
Perform with a knack yes I was born to rap
The mic Lebanon Teflon don is back
I strike with better bombs and armed to attack
So reload the van go ahead let em in
Every tours a war and I'm on the road again
Suprise a town the place it's live and loud
We vibin' now I go wild and dive in the crowd
Never hit the ground they catch me and carry me around
Then put me right back on stage to shut it down
From New York to Cali, Japan and I-tali
I'm known as the microphone Muhammad Ali
I'm worldwide my brothers be biggin' me up
Keep the girls occupied lovin' diggin' me what
Ain't around when I come to town they mad glad
Like Saddaam they even say I'm the bomb in Baghdad

I'm the Gene Hackman in Heist
The game's Jason Richardson
Play cleaner hack me I'm right
Niggas chose yo' fate
Jaz-O in a golden state
Shows (ova)
I told ya (ova)
Hova? (ova)
Call me copter I ho-ver (ova)
Fo's roll (ova)
Play dead, no? No?
Me? Doubled a gift, none of the curse
Read by the best though weathered the worst
Street niggas savy second nature never reherse
Except for the verse
And there are classic, plastic bastards
Marcy the Foundation, the game is mastered
Some niggas are grown, some manufactured
Some pack ratchets, and clap you backwards
And some run track like faggots
Lets go!
Move yo' silly ass (ova)
Word to holme
No show at my video, you worthless holmes
These days shit is overly strange
Some nigga walkin round Brooklyn with a Roc-A-Fella piece and chain

[Hook]

[Outro to fade]
Say somethin
Say somethin motha fucka
This Kingz County
This Jaz-O
Y'all know where I'm at
Lets be real about it
Y'all can't fuck with me[Hook]
To the beat y'all..Check it out y'all..
To the beat y'all..Check it out y'all...

[Verse 1: Jaz & Jay-Z]
Hey yo lets begin with the beginning (The start)
Lets get deep within it (The heart)
Partner (Yeah) You gotta partner? (No)
Don't be sarcastic partner (OK partner lets go)
(Who's superior) Opposed to who?
(The inferior, we are the two enterprise ????)
You mean we're in the barrier of the better area
Causing havoc and hysteria?
Yeah, whatever French, yeah we in there
Like an 8 room pad with an upstairs
(Props are up here yea and they'll stay here)
Where else they gonna go dear?
(So ride the rhythm) C'mon, c'mon and widdit
(With the big foot fathom) Mmm mmm the unforgetit
The jitters we split it down to the endo
Never see us sweat it's just that simple

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jaz]
Jaz recites with simplicity
It ain't a mystery how I take publicity
That's positive got props risin'
A s-s-soothen like lotion on dry skin
Me and my man Jay-Z my partner
We start the flip flop lyrics
When you hear it, it's kinda hard to not sway
Got to resist to stay away from suckas'
Tryna say some, maybe another day sons
Next she quick flex didn't wana flex but it ain't complex
To the brothers with the complex, intellects
On tours most suppose to move the dancefloors
Maybe sometimes we break chores
Get your butts of the wall kids
Cause the fact that the matter is the track that Prince Paul did
Laced like colours on a silkscreen Sophie on the sofa
You know what I mean? Baby scoot over
See I'm here to report we never took sorts
We hold down the fort for sport
Marcy, Tompkins, Fort Green ya sucked in
LG's sell enough push we can roll so though
Cookin homebase Brooklyn ya break and get bent
Jaz and Jay-Z represent
Y'all be quick take some chatter face be nimble and
We'll pull the old dinner school, it's that simple

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Freestyle rhymes are easy to come by
A pen and a pad when it comes to this one guy
Some try to lead tongue tied
Cause they flow like not a and felt the breeze when I shot by
I get props cause I rep broke
Cause someone ask you to step
No I wreck so yo'
Check on to the next line it seems sensible
For a dope beat you seek the Prince Paul
It's so simple to envy me to the alike
A people who like things done right
You can let go intro to the insult
Emcee's are perpetual when Jay lets the pen flow
And it's laid back, Paul make sure it's stay back
It's just that simple
Play a track with these the J-A-Y-Z too ease
Still treatin' new emcee's like newslead?
Together wit the Jaz top brads
You got the plot? get ready to lock gas
To tell the truth Paul I'm ready to rip the booth off
Make room for the new force the true boss
Let off your vest fail to amaze me kid whatchu wanna' be
Jaz and Jay-Z is on top
Never know when to retire never perspire, it's just that simple[Verse 1: GZA]
Who won the covenant role, based on a nationwide poll?
For the grip tales told and rap scrolls
Perfect pitch for language that's built within
Where half the rap ink couldn't hold my pen
Meanin' when emcees came, to live out the name
They signed the documents with the, blood of the slain
Far removed from this hip hop life off course
But the confidence and resilience was never lost
In the think tank and research labs I laid tracks
Seen work rule my life but it never broke my back
Destiny forever shake from the events to come
From the father and the chemical contents of the sun
A solid gold figure with a verse that glitters
Until the platinum beat comes increasingly bitter
They joined in a likely alliance with the rest
Schemin' with unsuccessful in a zealous Quest
We all see, with a degree of certainty
Who the fake, cowardly cats behind the curtains be
(Yeah, yeah...)
They hunt, for the skin, flesh, the blood, and bones
In front, want to impress with studdes stones

[Hook: Anthony Allen]
Now who's the man who brought you the Legend
Of the Liquid Sword?
Rap critics say "Damn, you're sick with your's"
4th Chamber and the Shadowboxin' too
That Nigga be the GZA from Wu
And if you don't know
About the pyroclastic flow
Hotter than the spark that made it blow
You better recognize, recognize....

[Verse Two: GZA]
My U-N-I-verse run like clockworks forever
Words pulled together, sudden change in the weather
The nature and the scale of events don't make sense
A storm with no warnin', you're drawn in by immense
Gravity that's gone mad, clouds of dust and debris
Moving at colossal speeds, they crush an emcee
Since this rap region is heavily packed with stars
Internal mirror in the telescope, noticed the Czar
From far away, they blink as the lightnin' strolled
Great distance of space between precise globes
That travel in a circle of order
Like the tape in your cassette recorder filled with cult for slaughter
(Yeah, yeah...)
Meaning the con-tracts manifestly work
The hitman for hire, weapon in his hand he lurks
Inspite of the strange appearance he laid a clearance
On his target through a crowded market
No interference
The microphone left on the scene without a serial
Evidence consistent with organic material (Well)
Surprisingly, as we marched lively with great size and degree
'Til it spread widely

[Hook][Jaz-O]
Understand the moment

Stop everything

The originator

The alpha and omega

[Jay-Z]
We at 80 right now Jaz we almost at 100

[Jaz-O]
The first and the last

I am here
Kings County, we outside yall, lets go niggas

[Jaz-O]
God's here, the Aston parked here
Chicks in the cut in just the brazierres
In this at-most-phere
Yo ass cross here
It's yo night shorty get your lip glossed smeared
Toss the panties (This is), Marcy family
(This is) Kings County you hear me, spring through fall
Ain't nothing po' but this alcohol (for real)
My numbers complicated algebra
I lean in cars, lean of Bacardi dark
Shorty wit a mean ass lean on yours
She's on fours
3 in the morn'
For me the bomb and she going down and out
Next day wanna meet me in town I'm out
I think I made her cross-eyed
When I hit her broad side
My name haunts chicks, train the thought
My dick stick in they mind, run a train on they thoughts

(Hook)
To my (playas get ya dollas)
Like its no tommorrow, all my (ladies in Manolo)
Respect game you follow
Can I grub, read
(show)love (to) my thugs
And all my women to succeed lets go
(Repeat)

[Jay-Z]
Big pimpin'
Walk wit a small limp an'
I'm here to scoop you broads
Out ya mid-size cars
Bring ho's out the closet, my dough give chicks motive
You got enough money to unfold it
But one thing yall can say about Jay its not a day I ever bought it
Yall can audit my life
I put that on my unborn daughters life
All I give 'em is game
I don't give 'em my name
Chicks leap through hoola-hoops to get in the flame
All it takes it Cristal juice to get in they pants, man
Ain't't nothing gon' change bout Hov but my sock, my drawers
And my Roc-a-wear clothes
And of course the flows
So pretty soon I'll be able to rhyme in Morse code (beep beep beep beep)
Please believe me, But enough about Jay
My resume speaks for it's self, getcha keys we leavin'

(Hook)
(Repeat)

[Dibiase]
Girls grillin, but hatas do less scopin'
Dibi's like tennis I got the US Open
And I don't say much but when it's time to yap
They callin me ??? for all the dimes I tap
The roley?, no, might see the Telerium
Waves got em nauseaous might catch stelerium
Got broads changin puttin em on learnin
Levis?, no, put on them Ron Hermans
Last week a handball switchin on the polo
Nine West, eehh, switch em to Manolos
The reason why girls wanna switch they plans
See Dibiase once and wanna ditch they man
Actin like Dib and really in the room
Till I'm risin to the top like a helium balloon
Like breget brain, step it up to cranium
Its crazy her ball game kept it up in stadiums

(Hook)
