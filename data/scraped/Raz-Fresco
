VERSE:
What good is it getting knowledge if the people ain't
Cuz if the people dont then shit'll be the same
The God rock ropes obese yo peep the chain
Heat the Jane then i peep the game let my speakers bang


... ....
So many lives lost over lie wars
Be a king nigga not a fool use your mind more
24/7 on my grizzy til my eyes sore

Be a queen pop that pussy for me when behind doors
Gotta learn bout the darkside so you shine more
Higher source, i just tap in so im fly of course
9z or 4z spit to wavy loops for Mercedez coupes

I play the couch play ya spouse out them daisy dukes
When I brainstorm shipwrecks on major routes
Many blacks strapped pack gats crack trading routes
Never seen nothing else they dont know what to do

Fast cash young make slow money look like baby food
Turn em to a beast like MJ in 82
Make some moves now the hotties with the fatties jockin
Analyzin rize now she mine panties dropping

Tantalize minds with the rhymes becky's bopping
Raz be the baker and my chick betty crockin
Bring the terror to em get ill Remy Ma shit
Mob chick, ride til the end no precautions

Flow razor sharp I slice with the Mics, Mikes
On my feet and i hold the Mic with a gauntlet
And the God never GaGa over blonde chicks
Kick that like KaKa on the offense

Ahh shit, word niggas living mad fiendish
They dont really think all they thoughts is sequenced
Frequencies hella low so they need this
Roll on niggas with the funk like speed stick

Ugh, feeling like I gotta win
Nowadays there be more corruption then the oxygen
And its in the oxygen and the religious documents
Long as we brain dead we living through the apocalypse

Ugh, its cuz they infinite greed
Breed limitless schemes weaved intricately..

Cuz they do it in the middle east

Triple steez flip cheese twin chain symmetry
Patent leather bred xi's my slang kickanese
99 percent of you niggas can't say shit to me
Raz got that muthafucking funk I spit that piffery

Its history, you chicken feet
Hickory dickory instantly when you see me coming with the wizardry
Big willie cats gotta suck dick sinfully
To get where im at I just puff shit simply

Rhyming like im inna mink coat
My LP slit throats
You cuff bimboes I put they face in the pillow
Foes crowd me but they gotta gold crown me
Hoes down me, blow maui, flow rowdy, lo ralphy, YES

I steps in it like a puddle, fuck it, fucka cuddle
Just because these bitches say they love you doesnt mean they love you

Bishop  Verse:
Fading and im blooming
Going through my phases that the moon would
Facing and reducing all the true good
That you would receive being a sun
If you a 1, you wouldn't wonder you just prep when you heard the thunder

Thats word to mother, nature, he's the true earth
Care taker, never mistake him for a wage chaser
I plan to shake up, the world and make em wake up
They can't erase us we'll be dust before dusk so

Fuck an article you won't harvest my particle
I coulda been in harvard on the honour roll
Woulda copped the chop and let the lama go
But then my mind would float from nostradamus to osama's bro

So just to show that i have signs of both, are exposed
And heaven and hell are under my control
While yall stroll and under my control its
Universally common, our guys are demising
Often taught despised and try rising higher then high rises and

You'll be alright then, my fine friend

Life changes, life stages, sorrounded by
Devils and danger, against my nature i release the anger
Through the paper, to make the hall that make the hall of famer
Play the game or you get played a player peep the sega

Genesis of this no beginning or end to this
Metamorph the intelligence, see me one with the elements
Out of waters of melanin to this body i settled in
Everlasting life through the seed i plant the essence in

What you listen to the messenger or messages
Me i peep the wisdom in and in between the sentences cuz
Phony men, pull ya energy like scorpion to suffer here
But they know who been the G on they compass square

I got the vision 360 ecliptic
Build with my son cuz i see the sun in him
But mental poison in they denims
Go with the times or your times ending
As above so below seen hell to find heaven, yes its

When the pen touch paper nigga it's mad static fans passing static
Massses stack the cherish, my golden sound [?] folding clowns
Posted now, never posing below the ground what goes around come back
And it hit you even harder don't bother talking revolver that ain't the solver
Evolver, these things'll haunt you leave all the offers
I'll scorch ya beats and sauce for the realist author
No war for a plan to off ya corpse they off ya
Hit and torch em sit back and cause the exhaust fumes
What you gon do? I'll have ya baked breaking easy
Believe me, Bishop is illy, tracks stay on repeat
I defeat, any nigga ready to contest, yes I do impress
I'm next look to invest, never stress when adressing the best
It's sess ses till I rest imma bless and finesse nothing less

[Verse 2]
Nothing less than a doctor, only spot for me
Ain't hard to see I spark trees when we park the V
Impossibly, paused to see who's higher [?]
Ask [?] they yell Bishop the reviver
Who's liver? Nobody that you probably think
Their rhymes are extinct, we try to let em slide but they sink
Cause diamond and minks, take over their cranium
So ain't nobody playing em, they stay strayin em
Straight delaying em, we need to pray for em
If not, you lost your noggin, rappers I'm bothering
Flow cold like snow toboggan, they try to bog in for life
The mic is my knife, prepare for the cyph your flow born from a cyph
It's alright, I told you fuck it stay out of sight
It's like, when I be flowing don't you put up a fight
You born in the night, I asked for a light from the flight
And niggas surely be hype when there's blood in the pipe
Now that's life

I grind for my niggas tryna get they money
I floss for them broads that was acting funny
See me doing good so now she tryna love me
But I just hit it when I see er, she my punch buggie
On my grind cause dollar signs haunt my mind
All this time was underpaid
Now my name underlined , Bold - print , Oh shit
She just wanna shine like a glow stick
That's why I break her off , then I shake her off
Can I kick it
Niggas wanna fly
But they ain't tryna buy no ticket
I just laugh at em'
While I'm shooting jumpers from the Xbox
Debuting some deadstocks
Writing on my handheld
Refusing a wedlock
Oreo Jordan 6's tell me how my feet taste
Ayo this should've been an album for pete sakes
Got these Jordan 3's on
I rock em' for petes sake
And it's a rocky road to get that cheesecake

But we gettin to g-g-gettin to it
Gettin to it , We gettin to it
They see us gettin too it

These songs is my life
The grind is my wife
Got a Jordan 8 sole
And money on my brain
Nigga we ain't built the same
And ain't it funny
How I barely got dimes
And my pockets is full of change
And now they all change like a fashion show
And I see the bull like a matador
She ain't gettin past the door
And I ain't gonna pass that dough
Unless it's to my niggas though
I do the impossible Brad Pitt
You just picture 4
Get it, All spittin , Flow drippin
Dough gettin , Dough drippin
Rippin Hoes
They be jumpin to the parrow
They be like oh damn
Yo I ain't know you had those
I has those
Cause shit ain't a game like them hasbros
And if it was a game
I'd be tryna get on boardwalk
Tryna get that bread all on me like a corndog
For all you bastards my Jordan 7's veloceraptors
F y'all chatter , Talk is cheap and y'all ain't never matter
Verbal paint splatter on the blank canvas platter
Got that perfect baker batter
For that cake that they be after
I ain't never had no back up
I just wanted to be a rapper
I just wanted to be Vince carter
Before he had left the Raptors
Money comes first and the broads come after
She said I don't like you cause you a rapper
Passed her trash compactor that's garbage
Keep it one-hunnid you wasn't there from the starting
Don't change

[Outro]
Just cause we gettin to it , gettin to it
Gettin to it , they see us gettin to it
So they tryna get into it , Shit
Phony Niggas

She go to war for love and drop bombs out
But the ship needa anchor to hold it down

Say they got love they got love that go around
I got love real love for my main niggas

So work I put in too much for class

Living on a fucking budget, got me so disgusted
But I be back though, pulling up in the black Ac' though
Dreams of a nigga flourishing mad dough, sporing mad [lough?]
Who hopping out of that casino with cash-flow ??
I'm trying to get back to a cast, tired of being broke
Hoping that chasing all this cash don't make a nigga go before I'm 'sposed to

Yeah, we everywhere you go you can't ignore us
Ladies they adore us, fly and fresh from the floor up
I need less hype, more buzz,"What you drinking on?"
I ain't buyin', got an album out I ain't lyin'
She lookin' at me like, "Why he so cool?"
The only reason cause I ain't tryin', it's easy to me
I beat up the beat, I do it the way you supposed to
Talk mad shit but not social, crazy boy gone postal
Started off all local, now I'm bout to go global
November came I went loco, I'm crazy nigga I told you
I don't smoke but my folks do, I got a drug flow
But I'm dope too, I never lie I'm so true
I kill tracks but that's old news
I kill tracks and it's cold proof, I go ham and whole foods
I look fresh in those shoes, and I been real since '02

-New levels of stress im getting weeded now
Think im cheating on her got my girl freaking out
I see death in all directions
Cursed in this life that im blessed with

AYO THIS LOST GENERATION
Disconnected from myself trick knowledge got the young gods mind racing
Pacing, tryna figure out reality
Stressin, cursed in this life that im blessed with

... this the scripture
They pulled us over they say we fit the description
Looking out my vista, rizzlas all green like the riddler
Polo sport down in my pictures

My niggas chase death got nothing to live for
Except dollars, they spirituality ditched dust
Poof gone i drop shit niggas get pooped on
Sounding like i wrote this in the benz with the roof gone

Swiss chalet niggas grilling is chickes i skillet
The god skil level be, higher the wiz is
These niggas is cheese biscuits with whiskers
Always beside us, keep something thick in bawty riders

Come through like a giant and squash ya empire
Squash ya entire squadrons lost lifeless
Bars is like rikers while rappers slow like 50 tyson
Road to success hitchhikers

She say the mario pipe game boss level bison
M for mature rhyme liscense
Bury bars, bar burying, flow vikings
SYKE IM LIKE CUSHITE KINGS PEEP THE LIKENESS

Diamond since diapers, in my eyes wildfire
Got niggas shook up, shit ain't hard to look up
Dead presidents the only type im tryna pull up
Cuz live ones sold black men for white sugar

So yo i refuse to except refusals
Like i ain't really bouta refuse roots
But still niggas tryna rebuke truth
Like it dont matter now, WHAT WHERE WHEN WHY HOW WHO

Too much styles i can't hide it
Even if i tryed to please let me remind you
This is soul music, shit niggas cry to, shit niggas live to
SHIT NIGGAS DIE TO

P. Blackk who dat, I'm fresh yup
Never follow packs I been on the trend set
Cold blooded, cold swag cold everything
Back for the second time but I'm killing everything
And I'm down for anything except for settling
Party and bullshitting, and drinking and smoking weed
My flow very mean, never back-peddling
Ain't nobody out this dope to my recent memory
You don't know, what you do is what you going to get
I'm on it, it's just the [?sceen?] offset
I got dreams that kind of seem farfetched
But I got mo' heat than Maurice Clarette
And I got what you need, I got all that all black
I ain't catching wreck, what you call that
I'm about to spaz out rap 'til my jaw snap
And it's nice to meet you but don't tell me ya'll rap
It's all in motion, momentum won't let me stop it uh
You rapping like you ain't trying to make a profit huh
You rapping like you already done got it all
Only to find out you lying and you ain't got it uh

Stop what you doing turn me up louder
Ain't no more bravery, everybody cowards
When did everything I'm doing turn into ours
P. Blackk, but you could call me black power though
Adios, 'P' how you do it bro
I don't know I don't go anywhere I don't feel comfortable
And I'm about to be in [all?] cities, dig me
Never met a nigga that's fucking... with me

[Verse 2 Raz Fresco]
It's A, B, C, D, E .... 'Z'
Skip every letter in-between cause I'm mean
As Idi rappers trash but I ain't gonna clean your city
Leave that to the garbage man
I'm the beat killer drum kicks become martyrs, damn
Did I say that, no I sprayed that
From the lyrical forty-five, blow your brain back
Raz, Jessie Owns on the race track running
She run the top when I go where she stay at
Keep it smooth, see why I call her wave cap
Not your little rap boy, [swipe?] boy
[Metallic?] [five?] steel ten's aluminum alloys
[Steaz?] running through my veins like this weed
When I'm puffing it
Times is money, hoes ain't on my budget
You love it how I look, like the [shit?] in my Jordan's
You look like a big piece of shit in some Jordan's
Big difference, yeah give me the life sentence
I'm kill shit until I die for my own sickness
Easily spit this, nothing like you
You nothing like me, you something like [fool?]
How many dopes lines can I fit in one song
Until this shit pops, that's what I'm trying to find out
As soon as I'm on the court, timeout
You gotta quadruple team me or it's too easy
Cause you know how I do, niggas claim that my [?] is well
I seen [?] niggas just want [?]
Baker's Club in it like a [Geno?]
Got this shit locked like a keystone
One hit kill, no reload
It's easy

[Hook][Intro: Don Cannon]
Ladies and gentlemen
Haters and hatettes
I ain’t forget ya
No need for ? right now
You’re now listening to the sounds of the great Don Cannon

So without further ado
I’d like to bring to the stage the Bakersclubs own
Commision
Well Imma let him speak for me
Kill em

[Verse 1]
January 27th 1995
That’s the day I came alive
This the story of the boy in the basement
Ragin like my red Jordan fives
Borderline crazy
Mexican shit baby
Chili ride up
Writing rhymes up daily
You could hate me and stay upset
But I’m back in the bitch like makeup sex
In some 8’s
And I got the season cleaned up
Taking over on my mind
I got that ? fever
Dreams of pharaoh gold and Cleopatra divas
They say like a movie had to switch my scene up
So I back room baboon work my ass off
Now it’s top floor ? take they pants off
And I bet they new era niggas take their off
When they see a young legend turn into their damn boss
I used to tell them all my dreams
They say get lost
All these girls fake I’ll have to settle for miss wrong
I swear they used to look at me like shit dog
And now I turn them backwards like crisscross
So don’t get this shit crisscrossed
A ? mixed up
A acrobatic flipped up
I really do this shit
I’ve been planning this moment since the first grade
Bakersclub,  the commission don’t act strange
I’ve been planning this moment since the first grade
I’ve been planning this moment since the first grade
I’ve been planning this moment since the first grade
Bakersclub,  the commission don’t act strange
You know the name Fresco on the back jersey
I don’t sleep I show rap mercy
Quit frontin’ like you niggas of young
This is 16 counts of murder one
So you suckas better get behind
This ain’t rap it’s the gift inside it
And I’m still steady dripping
Like when does that cash come
They gone wish they never doubted
How this rapper getting outed
Shows crowded
People mouthing the words I’m spittin
Greatness that’s the perfect description
And I do this every day
That’s how I’m living
Dudes snaking but their venom get them OG Jordan 6’s
Niggas bite that style so I switch it
On a seven digit mission
Bakersclub no admission
For you lames trying to get in
Yall Jokin’
Hoes see me, put their cameras on focus
But they never get the big picture
Even if they zoom out
My blueprint drew out
Hell you talkin’ bout
The steez killin’ where I walk
They got to ? the ground
Fly dude, if it’s Yao Ming
I’m still talking down
This ain’t bedrock, it’s bedrock
I got it down[Intro]

[Verse 1: Raz Fresco]
Im layin low cakin' bakin'dough lacing Jordan 4's

Why is these Bakers Club dudes so cool tho?
Glacier ice soles, thats why I move slow
Boss shit Hugo never been Bruno Mars, better change how you are when you messing wit the Bakersclub
Baby got that million dollar master plan and that cold flow yeah that Colorado Avalanche
Red wings on my Jordans 2's switch the flow up
Lames try and copy what I do pick they hoes up

These niggas tryna aim for my temple

They say they bars hard, they be simple
Trouble we get into when we spit on instrumentals
These niggas tryna aim for my...

[Verse 1]
When the pen touch paper nigga it's mad static fans passing static
Massses stack the cherish, my golden sound [?] folding clowns
Posted now, never posing below the ground what goes around come back
And it hit you even harder don't bother talking revolver that ain't the solver
Evolver, these things'll haunt you leave all the offers
I'll scorch ya beats and sauce for the realist author
No war for a plan to off ya corpse they off ya
Hit and torch em sit back and cause the exhaust fumes
What you gon do? I'll have ya baked breaking easy
Believe me, Bishop is illy, tracks stay on repeat
I defeat, any nigga ready to contest, yes I do impress
I'm next look to invest, never stress when adressing the best
It's sess ses till I rest imma bless and finesse nothing less

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Nothing less than a doctor, only spot for me
Ain't hard to see I spark trees when we park the V
Impossibly, paused to see who's higher [?]
Ask [?] they yell Bishop the reviver
Who's liver? Nobody that you probably think
Their rhymes are extinct, we try to let em slide but they sink
Cause diamond and minks, take over their cranium
So ain't nobody playing em, they stay strayin em
Straight delaying em, we need to pray for em
If not, you lost your noggin, rappers I'm bothering
Flow cold like snow toboggan, they try to bog in for life
The mic is my knife, prepare for the cyph your flow born from a cyph
It's alright, I told you fuck it stay out of sight
It's like, when I be flowing don't you put up a fight
You born in the night, I asked for a light from the flight
And niggas surely be hype when there's blood in the pipe
Now that's life

[Hook]

[Reversed Outro][Verse 1: Raz Fresco]
Ayo spiral be the movement of the spirits
Pyronetic spittin special edition kicks illin in the village
With Dynasty Visions, Dreams of major league pitching
Me and Bishop sufferin from ill young nigga syndrome
Killin shit and we co-defendants
Sittin back chilling rooms be marijuana scented
Egyptian gold my nigga got Cleopatra women
When you start the race, I be at the finish line illin
Who am I? Mr. Never Money Over My Niggas
Gluteus grippin She got nubian beginnings
She truthfully gifted, I caress her that's player pimpin
Ima fucking villain so fuck the system fuck if they feel this
Raptors Jacket Cash in the Denim
Time is money and I got mad money invested
In this rap shit, dwarf a giant when I rap shit
So much beyond the surface if you can pass this

[Hook: Raz Fresco]
Everything written in the Moon and the stars
And everything under the Sun has been done
But this shit right here?
There'll never be another
I said this shit right here?
There'll never be another

[Verse 2: Bishop Nehru]
A nigga tryna get it a scene that ain't hard to find
I'm hoping that lines or dimes will leave me the lines of dimes
Whether bitches or riches, I'm tryna avoid the stitches
Wanna be taking pictures with fans saying my rhymes vicious
My mind gifted, lines wicked try and switch this
Nigga up in the rough, and disrupting the sudden force of corrupt niggas must
Think they getting something from me
Since I got to the money
Even Elders been acting funny
And honeys no longer dummies
Remember when I was bummy, no clothes
With more foes coming by the boatload
A chokehold, is what I got the game in
You straining, I'm entertaining
Fans killing all the remaining
Patience, impatiently, wait and see
I murder rappers and on a daily basis we
Breaking weed, baking these tracks your ass lack
You wanna react, cut the slack and bring it back
It's a wrap

Raz Fresco! Toronto's Own! Don Cannon....
United States Own!
HaHaHa...BakersClub!
Let's Ride Out!

[Verse 1 : Raz Fresco]
Mind on my money, money on the check out desk, Yes
I'll be paying with cash miss, Raz quis, Alfred, Johnson, Stomping, Jordan 5! Olive!
Niggas and hoes watch us used to skip the kid, now they watch us like soap operas
At my locker like these niggas don't know what I'm bouta fuckin' do, run it George Double-U
Try to teach me yellow, red and blue but all i can see is green,brown and red
My beat files is dead my sneaks is dead stock
You can keep what's in your chest cause I just want the head bop, bop
Beatbox on it all day, all day all-day,
Till the mic low Raz got a nice flow
Spittin' Dr.Lizard serum liquid ice cold
Hoes be choosing precisely like the beam on sniper rifles
I'm at the top in my house clothes comfortable
But the flow hit the niggas like a cyclone
Kick game nuts like psychos never had a job but watch me blow 5 pay checks
On clothes money alone have them hoes like honey I'm home
They be lying though
Like Raz you the O-N-E said i got bars
Now she sayin' OH-HENRY!
Yo shit L-O-L my shit O-M-G i got them O & 3's
Rap go by the key
Got yo chick in the crib like a sit in and
I'm 'bouta cut like a ribbon how she keep it hidden? I don't know
Asking for my cell I said "I don't got a phone" cause I'm not tryna talk now you got to go home
Hit a couple vlogs, they ain't never write me back
LIked a couple girls they ain't never liked me back
But it's all good I ain't trippin' off that
I'm just riding to the top keeping real as i can
Blowing green out, blowing speakers out writing everyday
Tryna put my moms in a dream house. Break bread with my niggas that i came up with
Something slim, cute face on the side just.....CHILLIN'

[Verse 2]
Hop off that plane in the NY Station
My dad said he knew that i could make it
13 hour drive to Atlanta
All i wanted to be was a rapper
Hooked up with holiday stix and KD shit was crazy
Couldn't believe it when i met JD
Played him the CD he head nodding
I'm just speechless met exects the stars did major shit
Came home burger king applications shit
When niggas want what they can't have
So it make sense they didn't give a damn
When i was arms length away
Still the same dude they was looking like whatever
That's when i learned that you
That nigga when you closer to the cash
But just a nobody when you posted in the class with them
They only Raz missin, when Raz missin never chase hoes
Straight cash mission
Before they wanted Raz on the feature
Me and me dudes went hazz on the pizza
Nobody show me love they didn't pay attention
So that's why i gotta shout out the comission
Gettin money fuck yo 9 to 5 fuck the system
I be chillin on the grind any jordan 6's
Had a dream i had dough caked up
Didn't have to worry no mo'
All my niggas fed we ain't hungry no mo'
And all them fake hoes they ain't phony no mo'
Still the same dream of gettin a lil close
Got some more fans they feelin' a nigga flow
Got some more jays jumpman on the sole
I'm just tryna chill with my main chick on the low gettin the most      You couldn't walk a mile in these size 9s
Im chilling like a hippie no tie dye
These girls got me feeling like Im Einstein
Treat me like a giant when the nigga only 5'9 (Huh)
You couldn't walk a mile in these size 9s (3x)
Im chilling like a hippie no tie dye
These girls got me feeling like Im Einstein
Treat me like a Giant but the nigga only 5'9 (Huh)
And the kick game sy fy
Unreal only see them shits online
Been on the same shit for a long time
Young pimp guess she gave her heart to the wrong guy[Intro]

You made it look like
You were playing
Your a phony, Your a big fat phony
That's right your a big fat phony

[Verse:1]
I grind for my niggas tryna get they money
I floss for them broads that was acting funny
See me doing good so now she tryna love me
But I just hit it when I see er, she my punch buggie
On my grind cause dollar signs haunt my mind
All this time was underpaid
Now my name underlined , Bold - print , Oh shit
She just wanna shine like a glow stick
That's why I break her off , then I shake her off
Can I kick it
Niggas wanna fly
But they ain't tryna buy no ticket
I just laugh at em'
While I'm shooting jumpers from the Xbox
Debuting some deadstocks
Writing on my handheld
Refusing a wedlock
Oreo Jordan 6's tell me how my feet taste
Ayo this should've been an album for pete sakes
Got these Jordan 3's on
I rock em' for petes sake
And it's a rocky road to get that cheesecake

[Hook]
But we gettin to g-g-gettin to it
Gettin to it , We gettin to it
They see us gettin too it

[Verse:2]
These songs is my life
The grind is my wife
Got a Jordan 8 sole
And money on my brain
Nigga we ain't built the same
And ain't it funny
How I barely got dimes
And my pockets is full of change
And now they all change like a fashion show
And I see the bull like a matador
She ain't gettin past the door
And I ain't gonna pass that dough
Unless it's to my niggas though
I do the impossible Brad Pitt
You just picture 4
Get it, All spittin , Flow drippin
Dough gettin , Dough drippin
Rippin Hoes
They be jumpin to the parrow
They be like oh damn
Yo I ain't know you had those
I has those
Cause shit ain't a game like them hasbros
And if it was a game
I'd be tryna get on boardwalk
Tryna get that bread all on me like a corndog
For all you bastards my Jordan 7's veloceraptors
F y'all chatter , Talk is cheap and y'all ain't never matter
Verbal paint splatter on the blank canvas platter
Got that perfect baker batter
For that cake that they be after
I ain't never had no back up
I just wanted to be a rapper
I just wanted to be Vince carter
Before he had left the Raptors
Money comes first and the broads come after
She said I don't like you cause you a rapper
Passed her trash compactor that's garbage
Keep it one-hunnid you wasn't there from the starting
Don't change

[Outro]
Just cause we gettin to it , gettin to it
Gettin to it , they see us gettin to it
So they tryna get into it , Shit
Phony Niggas
I swear these niggas change when you gettin tooo it
I swear these girls change when you gettin tooo it
That money ho , yeah that money ho
Like me now but you was acting Phony though
Phony Though[Chill will]
You ain't never seen a nigga this fly
In my air Jordan 5's, give a nigga high fives
Im gold chain Mike to these dudes on sidelines
And they needa step back cause im finna take flight
Mike in the church cause a nigga sky high
No im Mike Tyson to these beats that im biting, chewing, eating
Forever punch lining, but you gon need more that Mario to punch me out
Never on the rebound, cause I don't need no rebound
Unless we talking hoes then im no shirt Boris b Diaw
Air Jordan 4's with the strings out
Og's my kicks gon see now, like a old nigga
And you ain't gotta ask chill where his gold nigga, I ain't in my nose nigga
But im calling picks out from the bleachers, deadstock sneakers
Hasta la vista!

[Raz Fresco]
Spit raw shit salmonella
Deadstocks locked up longer then mandella
Stella, Got my groove back, smooth black, suede blue hat, with the rap-
Tor on the front, flame on the blunt, name on the front
Of your chick page with the love
Heart sign right beside it, make you wanna sign out when you see it
Pardon my sneakglish, im decent, that's what the least Ill niggas be speaking
Don't got a G2, but im flyer then a G6
I get colder the higher, I get up call it ski lift
With the wifey, use the purse as a weed bag
As I pen greatness over bass, like rehab
And the sucker shit yall on, ain't making me mad
Cause if you check it out, it ain't making me cash
I mean it sound so trash that it's making me glad
That I got my own shit to listen to
Play it while I

[Chill Will]
Certain niggas got me feeling like caine
All I need now is some gold ropes and some rings
A couple babes, glass of lemonade
And I be standing under the green, but I ain't in the shade
But I do got these shadow number 10's on
Why all these niggas dancing in the endzone
And they ain't scored yet
A nigga asked me how your soles icy and you ain't leave the floor wet
I don't know though
But a bitch said I was so cold that her cell phone frose when she text me
Chopping on them blades like im Gretzky
Yall jabs weak, and I eat them punchlines for breakfast
With Mj on the box
In them Grape Jordan 5's and I like them a lot
That I might just cop bout 4 in my size
Yall niggas like Deadstocks, yall don't think out the box

[Raz Fresco]
But I ain't dissing you
Im just tryna tell you that this rap shit isn't you
This what the PYT's came to listen to
This the bakers club so the booth by the kitchen room
And the house don't got a roof
Cause it can't get higher than this
And you ain't gotta guess who supplying the zip
Filled with the realness filled with the illness
Millions and millions that's like a sure thing
Show me bout it, don't tell Me bout it that's the worst thing
The worst thing, since fox news on the TV
Harder I go, all the girls get easy
I don't use pick up lines, that shit cheesy
Use by beginners, im bumping that GZA
And if her brain like a genius, ima have to jizz her
One more line, bet I make the beat give upVERSE 1:
Ayo god its now or never, lets get this cheddar
Cuz if we rise now we rich forever, and if we die now we live forever
Lets divide thous and stick together
Im polo down in the frigid weather, hilfiger sweater

My divine speech be waist deep like tyrese
Til i top meech, puch i-roc z's at top speeds
Get it in til my eyes bleed, circa 93
Air jays, catch me on that cooler shit like shariff

Cuz we weak, so thats why i be on my black power
Shit, black fist clenched eurocentric sorroundings
Stay true til my last hour, go out blasting
If they comin for me like im mike jackson

..and until im watchin martin in the aston im
Carving out my name on the chest of these fake rappers call me
Pablo, acid wash jeans army jacket
Strictly, in it for the cash chips and all dat we

Lost in the world, lost in this life

Niggas damn near 40, actin like they shorties
Shorties damn near 10, actin like they men
This the real news real news no cnn i dont
Feel u feel u.....

VERSE 2:
Tell em niggas get off us, with they bullshit offers, we scholars
I poke ya pocahontas regardless who want it?
The flow polished, like im mopping we righteous mobsters
Gotta be militant thats word to papa

Over the bluntfire, he spoke and said gotta help the people rise up
Fill the mind up, if not get use to niggas lined up
For prison systems, court systems, school systems
Fuck the system, they play neutral with hidden agendas

It ain't in my nature, to hate nature embrace paper
But in this world we live in gotta get it to be major
And none of us above the law except the law makers
All the rich people bend laws po' niggas break em

Im saying, ayo the skill god given
My shit really dope you just rick rossing it
Got that cali kush ain't tryna get caught wit it
So if the bwoy dem come im finna get lost with it im gone

Cowards, to da nigga in dat eddie baeur[Verse 1 : Raz Fresco]

Green like luigi nigga
Unholy flow wrote it on a ouija nigga
Daughters, Sisters, Nieces fighting just to see these niggas
Rubbing on me but they ain't looking for no g-genie nigga
Fly like keep it E.T
I dont ever B-E-G
Girls on the B-E-D
Play em like a DVD
Catch me in the BBC
Beats give the D-D-P
These niggas here go and go .. ?
Yellowbone lemonade braws on some gucci shit
Get the camera drop it low kick game ludacris
Ever since I blew and shit my ho count numerous
Like Wendy how you doin bitch?
Foolish kicks goofy shit
Girls with fat ass love us super smash brothers
Dont pack gats I pack rubber spree stacks cut ya, You rap supper?
Fat bumper humper must attract clothes that track suffer
Mother fucker...

[Verse 2 : Brandun DeShay]

I tell em Raz you ain't gotta spaz to get em I got em
Peoples champ and these beats give the rock bottom
Slide right on em like the grace thet they fell from
Delivery is sweet see they face when the mail come?
Been doing hail mary's before I could learn huddle
Before I turn subtle I promise to earn double
So every track im on gotta come with a brass knuckle
So I drop it like a (PLOP) on top of a turn buckle
Lets go Raz Fresco and Shay is a tad special
Till we finish the next show and cash go in the escrow
Watch how that money pile be a witness to good business
And how I run the Shaq the be a witness to good fitness
But you get into to this then just wait we got a ton more
Me and Raz handing out bangers like gun stores
And ofcourse more niggas gon love it than gon hate
So haters can eat a dick sincerely Bran DeShay[Verse 1: Raz Fresco]

Love is understanding, hate is the opposite
Im the foundation, these woman get on top of it
Many seeds fell off the tree but one dominant
Look inside ya soul young god thats where the knowledge is

Ride to the ride to the ride til apocalypse
I ain't with the i ain't with i ain't with the politics if /
This my last breathe ima say something thats positive
..and let the light flow all thru ya consciousness

It was written on the tablets and the amulets
Yoo the sun shine natural can't polish this
Love ya curves baby got me risen like an obelisk / you
Look like a monument, document my astonishment

Did the 1 bypassed mad colleges
Dropout, dont ever fix ya lips like collagen
And say something when u gone end up apologing
A lotta cats confined in they confidence

Honestly, the rap game infinite
God supreme killing the false regimes kicking this
Ignorance, god they only care for they benefit
Im tryna touch every soul im existing with

And to do dat, my crew back with the bomb fire
Attack flow, gotta acknowledge who the champ rock the
Title belt, off the shoulder like spaghetti strap
Knowing these niggas scheming gotta b ready for dat

Machete the rap, enter the booth and empty the mac
Im freddy to cats, they worship wats on my pen and pad
Genocidal to fake niggas that dishonour the past
How long will i last, forever, the original man

Insidious land, young teens like yo simity sam
Burners like stove tops cookin the death inna pan/
Pan to the right shine like diamonds in the night
Drop a gem for the babies, cop the sl mercedez its the club

[Verse 2: ChillxWill]

Yo peep the baby blue Lex'
And the way that he be spitting out the navy Avirex
Polo Sport my chest
We army fatigued
Wear tennis shoes for speed
Slang dice, blow trees
It's all real in the battle field

I channel my energies
To catch the mass appeal
And drop the real
Cinematically dropped the reel
Now do you feel this
You tuned into life's illness, shit
I never knew what a blue pill is

It's mad pollution
Mass confusion, mind illusions
So I proceed to spread word while you niggas tuned in
Now who win
Win the godbody life forever
We rap what's real, you rap what's clever

I smash the lever to obsolete all ya future endeavors
And pack ya rhymes back in ya wack ass jetta
Now hit jacks
While the CLUB niggas kick facts
And you still wondering who's black[Intro]

[Verse 2: Louie BiGGavell]
Stacking bread like a bad game of tetris
Only dating chicks with a body like a lexus
When I say a lexus
Im not talking bout a bitch name Alexis
Im talking bout that whip niggas need an advance just to purchase
Crazy
Got the biscuits and the gravy
Call me Festus
Chillin’ with them niggas in all black but they not gothic
They be invading pads Van Dam straight robbin’
And im dozing off I just popped a hydro
But these hoes still tryna fuck pullin’ on my clothes
Speakin’ of them clothes
Always in a tee no polo
Trill shit slow down the track that’s my fast flow
Got these girls puffin with the kid now that’s powerful
Uh my nigga I be three hot
That’s why word up was more anticipated than Detox
And I stay with an Arizona
Mix it with the tussin now we sippin’ stronger than corona
Pimpin’ dames kicking one out than invite the next one over
Highway to success solo…no chauffer[WARNING SHOTS]

VERSE:
What good is it getting knowledge if the people ain't
Cuz if the people dont then shit'll be the same
The God rock ropes obese yo peep the chain
Heat the Jane then i peep the game let my speakers bang


... ....
So many lives lost over lie wars
Be a king nigga not a fool use your mind more
24/7 on my grizzy til my eyes sore

Be a queen pop that pussy for me when behind doors
Gotta learn bout the darkside so you shine more
Higher source, i just tap in so im fly of course
9z or 4z spit to wavy loops for Mercedez coupes

I play the couch play ya spouse out them daisy dukes
When I brainstorm shipwrecks on major routes
Many blacks strapped pack gats crack trading routes
Never seen nothing else they dont know what to do

Fast cash young make slow money look like baby food
Turn em to a beast like MJ in 82
Make some moves now the hotties with the fatties jockin
Analyzin rize now she mine panties dropping

Tantalize minds with the rhymes becky's bopping
Raz be the baker and my chick betty crockin
Bring the terror to em get ill Remy Ma shit
Mob chick, ride til the end no precautions

Flow razor sharp I slice with the Mics, Mikes
On my feet and i hold the Mic with a gauntlet
And the God never GaGa over blonde chicks
Kick that like KaKa on the offense

Ahh shit, word niggas living mad fiendish
They dont really think all they thoughts is sequenced
Frequencies hella low so they need this
Roll on niggas with the funk like speed stick

Ugh, feeling like I gotta win
Nowadays there be more corruption then the oxygen
And its in the oxygen and the religious documents
Long as we brain dead we living through the apocalypse

They plotting on me plotting homicide... [wow]

Ugh, its cuz they infinite greed
Breed limitless schemes weaved intricately..
[wow]... so I dillinger thieve from the elite
Cuz they do it in the middle east

Triple steez flip cheese twin chain symmetry
Patent leather bred xi's my slang kickanese
99 percent of you niggas can't say shit to me
Raz got that muthafucking funk I spit that piffery

Its history, you chicken feet
Hickory dickory instantly when you see me coming with the wizardry
Big willie cats gotta suck dick sinfully
To get where im at I just puff shit simply

Rhyming like im inna mink coat
My LP slit throats
You cuff bimboes I put they face in the pillow
Foes crowd me but they gotta gold crown me
Hoes down me, blow maui, flow rowdy, lo ralphy, YES

I steps in it like a puddle, fuck it, fucka cuddle
Just because these bitches say they love you doesnt mean they love you
Heard that shit before, like a couple times, so i can't trust you
Motherfuck u, son, sun em got em screaming uncle.....
